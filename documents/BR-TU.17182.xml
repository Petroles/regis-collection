ABSTRACT  

 

Fishery and aquaculture products are considered indispensables in balanced diets, partly 

because they have high protein content and are an excellent source of almost elements, 

considered to be essential for man. However, such products can, in a certain extent, be 

contaminated with some chemicals, like toxic elements, coming from several sources. In 

Portugal these products assume particular importance since, within European Union countries, 

it is the one presenting the highest per capita consumption, about 56 kg / person / year. In this 

context, the primary aim of this work was to characterize the proximate and elemental profile of 

some seafood, commercialized in Portugal, in order to contribute for the evaluation of benefits 

and the hazards associated to their consumption.  

All products presented a similar pattern in what regards the essential elements. Dominant 

constituents were potassium, chloride, sulphur, sodium, phosphorus, magnesium and calcium. 

Interesting contents of zinc, copper and iron were also found, mainly in the three cephalopods 

and the crustacean. The results lead to the conclusion that these species can be a major 

contribution to the recommended daily intakes of essential elements. 

Appreciable amounts of total arsenic were detected in Norway lobster and octopus; however, 

as about 90 % of this element is mostly in organic form in marine organisms, these species do 

not constitute a hazard in terms of human consumption. The highest total mercury contents 

were found in deep-water fish species while the lowest were found in bivalve molluscs. Canned 

seafood reflected the profile of raw-material. Regarding lead and cadmium, the levels detected 

in all edible part of samples were below the EU limits with the exception of some mollusc 

samples. 

Attending the results obtained, this study supports the importance of promoting consumption 

of fishery and aquaculture products, although some species have to be consumed moderately 

given the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) values for toxic metals recommended by 

FAO/WHO. The probability of exceeding the methyl-mercury PTWI, among the three 

cephalopods in Portugal, is considered minor.

RESUMO 

Os produtos da pesca e aquicultura são considerados indispensáveis num regime alimentar 

equilibrado, porque têm elevados teores de proteína e de ácidos gordos polinsaturados do tipo 

ómega-3, apresentam baixos níveis de colesterol e são uma excelente fonte de quase todos os 

elementos, considerados essenciais para o homem. Além disso, são um alimento de digestão 

fácil. No entanto, estes produtos podem, em certa medida, conter alguns contaminantes 

químicos, como os elementos considerados tóxicos (arsénio, cádmio, chumbo e mercúrio), 

provenientes quer de fontes antropogénicas quer de fontes naturais. Estes elementos podem 

ser assimilados, armazenados e concentrados pelos organismos vivos, através da cadeia 

alimentar, originando efeitos fisiológicos graves.  

Em Portugal, pela posição priveligiada no conjunto dos países europeus, devido ao seu 

posicionamento geo-estratégico, frontal ao Oceano Atlântico, e pelo conhecimento acumulado 

ao longo de gerações das práticas e técnicas de capturas de espécies marinhas, da sua 

conservação e transformação e da sua utilização culinária, a pesca e o pescado sempre 

tiveram uma elevada importância sócio-económica. Daqui resulta que Portugal, do conjunto 

dos países da União Europeia, é o que apresenta o maior consumo per capita, cerca de 160 

g/dia. 

Neste contexto, o objectivo principal deste trabalho foi o de caracterizar o perfil centesimal e 

elementar de algumas espécies de pescado, comercializadas em Portugal, a fim de avaliar os 

benefícios e os riscos associados ao seu consumo. As espécies seleccionadas foram os 

cefalópodes (choco, lula e polvo), o lagostim e quatro espécies de peixe de aquicultura 

(dourada, pregado robalo e truta) por serem muito apreciadas e haver pouca informação sobre 

elas. Assim, para além dos quatro constituíntes principais, água, proteína, gordura e cinza, 

foram também quantificados 14 elementos considerados essenciais (cálcio, cloro, cobre, 

crómio, enxofre, ferro, fósforo, magnésio, manganês, níquel, potássio, selénio, sódio e zinco) e 

quatro considerados tóxicos (arsénio, cádmio, chumbo e mercúrio). No que se refere aos 

elementos tóxicos foram também analisadas algumas espécies de peixes de profundidade 

(cantarilho e peixe-espada preto), vários moluscos bivalves e algumas conservas de pescado. 

Foi ainda objectivo desta tese estimar o risco em função dos níveis de metil-mercúrio presente 

nos cefalópodes, ou seja, estimar a parte de uma determinada população em risco 

(probabilidade de exceder a dose tolerável de ingestão semanal de metil-mercúrio). 

Foram utilizadas várias técnicas para realizar as análises elementares - espectrometria de 

absorção atómica (chama, em fase de vapor frio e por combustão directa), fluorescência de 

raios X por energia dispersiva (EDXRF) e espectrometria de absorção molecular (UV-Vis). Para 

quantificar as probabilidades de risco associadas ao consumo de cefalópodes, recorreu-se a 

um tratamento matemático-estatístico, utilizando os valores de metil-mercúrio. 

De um modo geral, os resultados obtidos demonstram que as espécies estudadas têm um 

elevado teor proteico e podem ser consideradas magras, à excepção das espécies de 

aquicultura que apresentaram teores de gordura superiores aos valores usuais nas congéneres 

selvagens. 



iii 

Em regra a distribuição dos elementos essenciais nas espécies estudadas era semelhante. 

Os elementos predominantes foram potássio, cloro, enxofre, potássio, sódio, fósforo, magnésio 

e cálcio seguidos do zinco, ferro, cobre, crómio, selénio, manganês e níquel. No entanto, os 

perfis observados nos três cefalópodes e no lagostim diferiam do dos peixes. Assim, o potássio 

era mais abundante nos peixes do que nas outras espécies e o teor de cálcio foi mais elevado 

no crustáceo, possivelmente devido ao processo de biomineralização da carapaça. Também 

foram encontrados teores de zinco, cobre e ferro, mais elevados nos três cefalópodes e 

crustáceo do que nas espécies de aquicultura. O lagostim também apresentou níveis elevados 

de manganês e de níquel. Estas diferenças são devidas principalmente às características 

intrínsecas de cada espécie, habitats e dietas. Em geral, de entre os três cefalópodes, a lula foi 

a que apresentou menores teores dos vários elementos essenciais. No que se refere aos 

peixes de aquicultura observou-se que o pregado revelou os menores teores da maioria dos 

minerais. Os resultados obtidos indicam que as diferentes espécies podem contribuir para as 

doses diárias recomendadas de vários elementos essenciais, como enxofre, fósforo, zinco e 

cobre no caso dos cefalópodes e de fósforo, zinco, cobre  magnésio e selénio no lagostim. Por 

seu lado as espécies de aquicultura estudadas são uma boa fonte de fósforo e potássio. 

Em relação aos elementos tóxicos, o universo das espécies foi alargado a peixes de 

profundidade, moluscos bivalves e conservas de pescado, pelo facto de existir pouca 

informação sobre a sua eventual contaminação e também serem importantes do ponto de vista 

do consumo. Os níveis de arsénio total no lagostim e no polvo eram elevados, no entanto, 

como cerca de 90 % deste elemento se encontra sob a forma orgânica nos organismos 

marinhos, estas espécies não constituem um perigo para o consumo humano. No que respeita 

ao mercúrio total, os teores mais elevados foram encontrados no músculo das espécies de 

peixes de profundidade, como o cantarilho e o peixe-espada-preto, excedendo alguns 

exemplares (70 % e 20 %, respectivamente), os limites propostos pela União Europeia. Este 

facto decorre destas espécies terem uma grande longevidade, serem carnívoras e habitarem 

zonas que as podem predispor à exposição de contaminantes químicos. Também se 

verificaram para estas duas espécies correlações significativas entre os níveis de mercúrio total 

e alguns dados biométricos e região de captura. O mercúrio orgânico representou no cantarilho 

e no peixe-espada-preto cerca de 86 % do mercúrio total o que indica que o consumo destas 

espécies deve ser parcimonioso (no máximo uma refeição por semana). Os níveis de mercúrio 

total encontrados no lagostim indicaram alguma contaminação, mas tendo em conta o baixo 

consumo, per capita, desta espécie, não parece representar um risco para o consumidor 

português. Os bivalves foram as espécies que apresentaram as menores concentrações 

médias de mercúrio total (&amp;lt;0,05 mg/kg). Por seu lado, as conservas, reflectem o perfil das 

matérias-primas, assim, por exemplo, as de atum apresentaram valores médios mais elevados 

de mercúrio total (0,28 mg/kg) enquanto que nas de sardinha e de mexilhão os valores médios 

eram muito baixos (&amp;lt;0,05 mg/kg), o que está de acordo com os valores habitualmente obtidos 

para estas espécies. 



iv 

Em geral, os níveis de chumbo e de cádmio foram, para todas as espécies e exemplares, 

sempre inferiores aos limites indicados pela União Europeia, sendo as de aquicultura as que 

apresentaram os valores mais baixos (? 0,05 mg/kg). Contudo, existiram algumas excepções 

em amostras de moluscos, quer de bivalves quer de cefalópodes e em algumas conservas, 

nomeadamente nas de lula. Os teores mais elevados nos moluscos resultam não só da sua 

morfologia mas também do tipo de habitat, como os estuários, que os tornam mais 

predispostos à acumulação e concentração de metais tóxicos como o cádmio e o chumbo. 

Assim, o limite proposto pela União Europeia de 1,0 mg/kg para o cádmio foi ultrapassado em 

10 % das amostras de cefalópodes, 18 % das amostras de conserva de lula e em 9 % de ostra 

portuguesa do estuário do Sado. Relativamente ao chumbo verificou-se que 50 % das 

amostras de lambujinha do estuário do Tejo excederam o limite proposto pela União Europeia 

(1,5 mg/kg). 

No sentido de avaliar o risco de ingestão de metil-mercúrio através do consumo de 

cefalópodes em Portugal, foi estimada a probabilidade de ultrapassar a ingestão semanal 

tolerável provisória desse composto pela combinação dos níveis de contaminação nos três 

cefalópodes estudados com a construção de cenários de consumo ou com uma distribuição 

hipotética do consumo para a população em geral portuguesa. Verificou-se que a lula não 

apresenta nenhum problema de saúde com relação ao metil-mercúrio, mas, para o choco e 

polvo, o consumo não deve exceder duas refeições por semana.  

Atendendo aos resultados obtidos, esta tese corrobora a importância de promover o 

consumo dos produtos da pesca e da aquicultura, devido sobretudo ao seu elevado teor em 

proteína e em elementos essenciais suficientes para satisfazer as doses diárias 

recomendadas. No entanto, algumas espécies devem ser consumidas moderadamente, dados 

os valores de ingestão semanal tolerável provisória (PTWI) para os metais tóxicos 

recomendados pela Organização Mundial de Saúde e pela Organização das Nações Unidas 

para a Agricultura e Alimentação (WHO/FAO).

FOREWORD 

 

This thesis is the result of a research project that was accomplished during the first years of 

this century at INRB, I. P. / L-IPIMAR and FCUL. It is divided into two parts: the first contains 

eight chapters and an annex and the second included nine scientific papers. The first chapter 

gives a brief general introduction of the world fisheries and the present situation in Portugal, in 

particular about the species studied in this thesis. The aims appear in the second chapter. The 

third chapter presents a background on the nutritional composition of seafood, particularly on 

the essential and toxic elements, as well as about the risks and benefits regarding in the human 

diet. The design of the study is presented in chapter four. All the methodologies used are 

described in the chapter five. The main results, reported in detail in the second part of this 

thesis, are summarized in chapter six. The major conclusions and possible future research in 

the same area of study are addressed in chapter seven. Finally, the references throughout the 

document are listed in the last chapter and in the Annex A, it is described the biology of all 

studied seafood species. 

The nine papers included in the second part are the result of the experimental work performed 

on several seafood species: three cephalopods (cuttlefish, octopus and squid), one crustacean 

(Norway lobster), four farmed fish (gilthead seabream, European seabass, trout and turbot), two 

deep-water fish (blackbelly rosefish and black scabbardfish), some bivalve molluscs and 

canned seafood (details in design of the study). 

The author wishes to state that the entire content of this thesis is of your responsibility, 

although, with papers in which it is co-author, it just attended a part. Thus, in the paper IV, 

analysis of ?-tocopherol, as well as all data on the species Lophius spp., Aphanopus carbo and 

Lepidorhombus spp were not their own. With respect to paper V, the levels of mercury were 

performed by colleagues from the University of the Azores. Regarding paper VI, the author 

provided data of mercury and methyl mercury and risk analysis was carried out by first author. 

In the case of paper VII only data from the cephalopods, crustacean and gilthead seabream are 

of the author.

1 INTRODUCTION 

1.1 Historical development of fisheries in the World 

Since ancient times fishing, hunting and harvesting of fruits were the first conscious and 

organized manifestations of man to fight hunger and survive. According to Cave Painting 

archaeologies man caught the fish in the rivers and lakes or along the beaches by hand or with 

small instruments, or with rudimentary buildings armed in the sand (Thomazi, 1947). As the 

fisheries grew, there was a need to store and to maintain these products for longer periods 

which led to the concept of handling and storage. 

Ancient civilizations like the Egyptian, Assyrian, Phoenician or Chinese were those that 

contributed to major progress in activities related to fisheries. It is thought that the Egyptians 

were the first to use salt as a process of preservation, the Phoenicians, for example, increased 

the trade of fishery products, since they were great navigators and the Chinese have 

contributed to a remarkable development in fisheries, using different fishing techniques 

(Thomazi, 1947). Later, in classic civilizations, the Greeks already had a great knowledge 

regarding the biology and behaviour of marine species and fishing technology. The main 

species consumed at that time was tuna, which was used as fresh, salted or marinated in oil. 

Upon extension of the Roman Empire there was a widespread of fishing methods in the 

Mediterranean by the central and northern Europe. The strong sea trade regime between the 

various Roman colonies due to the sophisticated taste food of the Romans, led to the 

installation of tanks and ponds on board or in the case of transport by land, the use of ice or 

snow, which caused the arrival of fresh fish products to the destination (Thomazi, 1947). 

In the Middle Ages with the fall of the Roman Empire, there was an almost total 

disappearance of industry and trade of fishery products in Europe, and this activity was only 

held locally. The most important sites where the man preserved the techniques of fishing and 

preservation were the religious institutions. The main species caught at that time were herring 

and cod (Thomazi, 1947)  

The fisheries in international waters appeared in the sixteenth century and was strongly 

continued over the seventeenth after the improvement of boats and navigation techniques. Due 

to business expansion, the fisheries and trade of seafood products were developed. With the 

invention of the steam engine and its application to fishing vessels from 1865, there was an 

increase in the capture of cod and herring (Thomazi, 1947). The introduction of new materials in 

fisheries and the discovery of new methods of preservation based on the industrial production of 

ice favoured a substantial development of the fisheries and trade dependent on it. In the early 

twentieth century was an extraordinary increase in catches due to the introduction of 

mechanized fishing activity, that was then stopped over the first and second world wars, 

however several new technological applications have been enhanced fishing, during this period. 

The appearance of the first steel ships using diesel, equipped with new facilities (more efficient 

nets, tracking devices, freezers) have allowed a better storage and processing of fishery 

products. 



Introduction

Recently, the world total production of fish, crustaceans and molluscs has continued to 

increase and in 2007, reached up to 140 million tonnes. Since 2001, capture production has 

stayed around 90 millions tonnes level and aquaculture production has continued to grow, 

attaining 50.3 million tonnes in 2007 (FAO, 2009). At the present, aquaculture is an important 

alternative to traditional forms of supplying the fishery products, According to Food and 

Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates, for the year 2030, aquaculture will dominate the 

market and it is likely that less than half of fish products consumption will come from traditional 

fisheries (FAO, 2003). The most caught species at the global level has been the Peruvian 

anchoveta, Alaska Pollock, skipjack tuna, Atlantic herring and Chilean jack mackerel. Global 

capture production of marine crustaceans and shell molluscs remained fairly stable, whereas 

total catch of cephalopods has continued its constant growth with an overall 35 percent increase 

during the last 5 years (FAO, 2009). Among the most important farmed fish species in the 

European Union are gilthead sea bream, European seabass, trout, turbot and salmon and even 

shellfish such as mussels, clams and oysters, whose production has been increasing in recent 

years and are often sold whole and fresh. About 81 percent of total fishery production (113.7 

million tonnes in 2007) was used for direct human consumption. The remaining 19 percent were 

destined for non-food products, mainly for the manufacture of fishmeal and fish oil (FAO, 2009). 

In Figure 1.1 it can be observed the evolution of World fish utilization and supply.

1.2 Fish consumption in Portugal

geo-strategic front to the Atlantic Ocean, and the accumulated knowledge of generations of

practical and technical catch of marine species, their preservation and processing and use as 

food. With an exclusive economic zone currently around 170,0000 Km
2
 and a coastline of 2,830 

km on the mainland and two island areas, the fishing has been always an important source of 

livelihood, especially for coastal communities, many of which are almost totally dependent on 

fisheries and other related activities (DGPA, 2007 a, b). 

In 2009, 144,792 tonnes of seafood, were landed in Portugal (Figure 1.2), which were 

unloaded as fresh or refrigerated in the auctions, accounting for a decrease of 14.9 % relatively 

to 2008 (INE, 2010). Behind this decrease was decisively the lower catch of marine fish (sardine 

and mackerel) and cephalopods, especially octopuses (INE, 2010). Relatively to crustaceans 

there was a rise due to an increase in the catch of shrimps (INE, 2010). Total aquaculture 

production in 2008 reached to 7,987 tonnes (Figure 1.3). This value implies an increase from 

the previous year of about 7.3 % of total. The production has been focusing on European 

seabass, gilthead sea bream and clam in sea water and trout in fresh water.

Introduction

Per capita consumption of seafood in Portugal is one of the highest among European Union 

(EU) countries and one of the largest worldwide, being estimated at 56 kg / person / year (FAO, 

2009). It should be noted that for example in Iceland this consumption is estimated at more or 

less 90 kg while in the United States is less than 25 kg. While it has seen in recent years the 

increase of meat consumption, it is expected that in future, the consumption of fishery products 

will grow due to diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and foot-and-

mouth disease (FMD) in meat. Moreover, a growing number of consumers prefer these products 

to consider that they are an healthier alternative to meat consumption or by dietary choices 

related to an easier digestibility. Fishery products fulfil an important role in human nutrition and 

they have economic advantages. The nutritional benefits originate in their valuable proteins, 

high content of ?3 fatty acids, low cholesterol level, mineral profile and contents as well as in 

some vitamins (Belitz et al., 2004; Simopoulos, 1997; Oehlenschläger, 1997).  

 

1.3 Importance of species used in this study 

From an economic point of view, some species are interesting due to the large quantities 

available at the moment and also because they are much appreciated in Portuguese cuisine. 

Among these species can stand out the cephalopods (octopus, squid and cuttlefish), some 

species of shellfish or black scabbardfish. Currently, farmed fish are also very important in the 

Portuguese economy mainly because they are highly valued species but at a lower price when 

compared to the same species of wildlife habitat. The most appreciated farmed fish are gilthead 

seabream and European seabass. Another fishery product very appreciated in Portugal are 

canned fish such as tuna or sardines in various sauces.  

Although, there is a huge amount of data available in seafood, most studies are concerned to 

North Atlantic or Mediterranean species. Regarding species and products in Portugal such as 

cephalopods, bivalves, deep-water species, farmed fish species as well canned products the 

available data it is not so abundant. Therefore, to ameliorate the seafood composition database, 

to better inform the consumers, data of that seafood are needed. Thus, this work focused on the 

various species described above, in particular, three cephalopods (cuttlefish, squid, octopus), a 

crustacean (Norway lobster), two deep-water fish (blackbelly rosefish and black scabbardfish) 

and four farmed fish (gilthead seabream, European seabass, trout and turbot). Also have been 

studied several species of bivalves molluscs produced in Portugal and some canned seafood. 

According to Instituto Nacional de Estatística (INE) (2010), in 2009, the most important wild 

species studied in the present work present about 15 % of the total seafood landed in Portugal 

(Figure 1.4). With respect to farmed fish studied in this work, they present about 50 % of the 

total produced in 2008 in Portugal (Figure 1.5). Bivalve molluscs represent about 2 % of the 

seafood landed and about 49 % of the total produced in aquaculture in 2008 (Figure 1.6). In 

what concerns average production of canned seafood in Portugal, the number is situated 

around 40, 000 tonnes, since 2001, being the most relevant canned sardine and canned tuna 

(Figure 1.7).

2 AIMS 

 

The aim of this work was to characterize the proximate and elemental content of some seafood, 

commercialized in Portugal, in order to evaluate the benefits and the risks of consumption of 

these species, not so well studied, but very appreciated in Portuguese cuisine. 

 

The specific aims were: 

 

• To characterize three cephalopods (cuttlefish, octopus and squid), crustacean (Norway 

lobster) caught off Portuguese coast and farmed fish species produced in Portugal 

(gilthead seabream, European seabass, trout and turbot) regarding centesimal 

composition and essential elements; 

 

• To evaluate the levels of toxic elements, as arsenic, cadmium, mercury and lead in the 

three cephalopods, one crustacean and four farmed fish. In addition, the levels of 

cadmium, mercury and lead were also studied in deep-water fish, bivalve molluscs and 

canned seafood products; 

 

• To quantify the probabilities of risks associated to seafood products consumption in 

Portugal and methyl-mercury contents, using cephalopods as model.

3 BACKGROUND 
3.1 Proximate composition and nutritional value of seafood 

The knowledge of seafood proximate composition is a key aspect to assess their nutritional 

value. However, this composition varies among species and depends on age and sex of 

individuals, as well as the environment and the spawning season. This is observed in wild fish 

from open sea or inland waters. The farmed fish also presents variations on proximate 

composition, having factors such as diet composition, environment, fish size and genetic 

characteristics an impact on the composition (Huss, 1995). Seafood meat is readily digestible 

as mammals but seafood is digested substantially faster than mammal ones and has therefore 

a much lower nutritive saturation value (Belitz et al., 2004). Like other food products, seafood 

contains water, proteins and non protein-nitrogen compounds, lipids, carbohydrates, vitamins 

and minerals. Apart from water, proteins and lipids are the major constituents while 

carbohydrates are the minor ones, although in molluscs can attained 5 %. Table 3.1 presents 

the proximate composition of some of the most consumed species in Portugal. 

 

Table 3.1 Proximate composition (g) and energy value (kcal/kJ) of some seafood species (100 

g of edible portion). (Source: Nunes et al., 2008).

Shrimp 79.2 17.6 0.6 1.5 77/322 

 

From the Table 3.1, it can be observed that a considerable normal variation can occurred for 

the constituents of seafood edible portion.  

 

3.1.1 Water  

Water is the most abundant constituent in the muscle of seafood, ranging usually between 50-

85% (Nunes et al., 2008). Within the same species water and fat contents are inversely related 

constituting around 80 % of seafood edible portion (Huss, 1995). This constituent plays a key 

role as a solvent for organic and inorganic solutes, and is an integral part in most of the 

reactions, having a major impact on the conformation and reactivity of proteins. Changes in the 



Background

amount of water present in the muscle affect their rheological properties, nutritional value and 

sensory quality. These changes affect the shelf life of fish (Sikorski et al., 1990). 

 

3.1.2 Proteins and other non protein nitrogen compounds 

As a rule, seafood contains 17-20 % of crude protein corresponding to 2-3 % of protein 

nitrogen (Nunes et al., 2003) These percentages are rather constant in most species although 

some variations can occurred during spawning (Huss, 1995). The proteins in seafood muscle 

tissue can be divided into the following three groups:  

• Structural proteins (ex: actin, myosin, tropomyosins), which constitute 70-80 % of the 

total protein content. These proteins are soluble in neutral salt solutions of fairly high 

ionic strength (0.5 M); 

• Sarcoplasmic proteins (myoalbumin, globulin and enzymes), which constitute 25-30% 

of the total protein. These proteins are soluble in neutral , salt solutions of low ionic 

strength (&amp;lt;0.15 M); 

• Connective tissue proteins (collagen and elastin), which constitute approximately 3 % 

of the protein in teleosts fishes and about 10 % in elasmobranches (Huss, 1995; Belitz 

et al., 2004). 

The proteins of fishery products have a high biological value because they have all essential 

amino acids and is also recognized its great digestibility. They play a key role in the growth and 

maintenance of vital bodily functions (Nunes et al., 2008). In Table 3.2 it can be observed the 

aminoacid profile of some species of seafood. Proteins collectively influence all the seafood 

sensorial attributes (colour, flavour, texture), and the post harvest deterioration of seafood meat. 

These compounds in seafood meat are also important because they contribute to chemical and 

physical changes during its processing (Haard, 1995).

The non protein nitrogen compounds (NPN) of seafood are significantly higher than that in 

other foods, about 9-18 % of total nitrogen in teleosts and 33-38 % in elasmobranches. The 

major classes of sarcoplasmic components are free amino acids, peptides, guanidine 

compounds, urea, nucleotides and quaternary ammonium compounds. These compounds are 

important because they influence the delicate taste of seafood and they contribute to the 

spoilage of fishery products (Simopoulos, 1997). 

 

3.1.3 Lipids 

The fat content can vary between 0.1 % and about 30 %. According to Belitz et al. (2004) 

seafood can be classified in lean (0.1 - 0.4 % of lipids), fatty (? 16 %) and semi fatty (0.4 % &amp;lt;

lipids &amp;lt;16 %). Generally, lean fish store lipids mostly in the liver and the fatty ones store in fat 

cells distributed in other body tissues. Semi-fatty species store lipids in limited parts of their 

body tissues only, or in lower quantities than classic fatty species. Typical lean species are the 

bottom-dwelling ground fish like cod, saithe and hake. Fatty species include the pelagic like 

herring, mackerel and sardine. Mullet, tuna and swordfish can be considered semi-fatty species. 

Despite of this classification, seafood is generally regard as a low fat food. The majority of 

seafood species contain less than 2.5 % of total fat, and only a short number of species has 

more than 16 %. The fat content of seafood is strongly influenced by season, geographical area 

and age. Hence, lipid content tends to be higher when fish are intensively feeding, frequently 

during summer period (northern hemisphere), and in older and healthier specimens. In addition, 

fat contents tend to be lower during spawning or reproduction and when food is less abundant 

(Nunes et al., 2003). Another important fact is that the dark muscle is fattier than the white one. 

This different lipid composition is related to the biological adaptation of different species, white 

muscle is used, particularly in sudden movements, while the dark is used in constant 

movement. Thus, species that show white muscle do not make major shifts to feed or reproduce 

(lower energy consumption), contrary to what happens to species that have dark muscle that 

utilize constant movement to achieve the same objectives, which implies increased energy 

consumption (Huss, 1995). 

The lipids present in seafood species may be divided into major groups: the phospholipids 

and the triacylglycerols. The phospholipids make up the integral structure of the unit 

membranes in the cells, frequently called structural lipids. The triacylglycerols are lipids used for 

storage of energy in fat depots, usually within special fat cells surrounded by a phospholipids' 

membrane and a rather weak collagen network. Fatty fish lipids are constituted especially by 

triacylglycerols, whereas in lean fish the phospholipids are almost 90 % of the total lipids in 

muscle (Huss, 1995). 

 

3.1.3.1 Fatty acids 

Seafood lipids are composed by a wide variety of saturated, monounsaturated and 

polyunsaturated fatty acids (consists of a chain of carbon atoms with a carboxyl group at one 

end and a methyl group at the other) (Figure 3.1), being the percentage of fatty acids with 20 or  



Background 

 

11 

 

Figure 3.1 - Structure of some polyunsaturated fatty acids. (Picture source site: Nephropal, 2009)  

 

more carbon atoms and more than four double bonds significantly higher than that found in 

vegetable oils and in mammalian fat (Huss, 1995). Many of these compounds belong to the 

omega-3 fatty acids family. Fish and shellfish ingest and accumulate such compounds through 

the food chain from algae and phytoplankton, which are the primary producers (Nunes et al., 

2003). The proportion and amounts of saturated, mono- and polyunsaturated and omega-3 fatty 

acids vary considerably from one species to another, and in farmed species is strongly 

dependent on the diet. As a rule, the fattier seafood contains more omega-3 fatty acids than the 

leaner. In human nutrition fatty acids such as linoleic and linolenic acid are regarded as 

essential since they cannot be synthesized by the organism. In seafood, these fatty acids 

constitute only around 2 % of the total lipids, which is a small percentage when compared with 

many vegetables oils (Huss, 1995). However, fish oils contain other polyunsaturated fatty acids 

which are also considered essential. The most important omega-3 fatty acids found in seafood 

are eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) that are beneficial to health. 

The effects of fish consumption on growth and development and in health and disease have 

been extensively studied in human life. Epidemiologic studies, clinical investigations, animal 

experiments, and in vitro studies have been carried out to determine the role of omega-3 fatty 

acids in coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, 

ulcerative colitis and other autoimmune disorders with encouraging results (Simopoulos, 1997, 

Kolakowska et al., 2003). Some of the typical values in the species most consumed in Portugal 

are found in Table 3.3. 

 

3.1.4 Carbohydrates 

The carbohydrate content in muscle of fresh fish is insignificant (&amp;lt;0.3 - 0.5 %) and generally 

lower than in mammalian muscle tissue (Belitz et al., 2004); however, certain shellfish store 

some of their energy reserves as glycogen, which contributes to the characteristic sweet taste 

of their products. Some bivalve molluscs contain 3-5 % glycogen while lobsters have around 1 

% (Simopoulos, 1997).

3.1.5 Vitamins 

Seafood is not considered a significant source of vitamins and its content are species specific. 

They can vary considerably within one species with age, size, sex, season, diet, state of health 

and geographic location. In farmed fish the contents of vitamins reflect the composition of the 

corresponding components in the fish feed. Therefore, the vitamin content of wild and farmed 

fish can be different (Rehbein &amp;amp; Oehlenschläger, 2009). According to the solubility of the 

vitamins, they are grouped into fat soluble and water soluble. In the first group are included the 

vitamins A, D and E, while in the latter are included the B complex vitamins. The levels of 

vitamin B are comparable to those found in many other foods with high protein content; some 

fatty species can be a reasonable source of vitamins A and D, although most fish species is not 

considered to be a good source of fat-soluble vitamins (Nunes et al., 2003). Also present are 

vitamins E and K. Vitamin E, which is present in foods in different forms, is presented in seafood 

mainly as ?-tocopherol that is the most efficient natural antioxidant in living organisms. This 

vitamin is found in significant amounts in seafood species that can provide about 15% of the 

recommended daily dose. Besides its role in prevention of lipid oxidation is also known its 

antioxidative action in the oxidative stress reactions originated by the rupture of mercury organic 

forms in target organs, being its action synergetic with selenium. In this type of food there is little 

vitamin C. In Table 3.4 it can be found mean levels of vitamins A, D and E in some seafood 

species.

3.1.6 Minerals 

Mineral content of seafood is in average between 1.2 - 1.5 % The constituents are almost the 

90 elements that occur in nature (Lall,1995).  

Since this thesis is mainly concerned with elemental composition of seafood this matter will be 

presented more detailed in the next sub-chapter. 

 

3.2 Elemental composition and main benefits and hazards 

Since some years ago the discussion on nutritional benefits in seafood was also focused on 

the mineral content, especially on the amounts of essential elements presented. In a simplified 

definition, essential elements are elements which are necessary required for the maintenance of 

life (Oehlenschläger, 1997). The major constituents of their body tissues are some bulk 

structural elements, present in amounts of percents, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, 

sulphur (S) and phosphorus (P). In addition, five macro elements, potassium (K), sodium (Na), 

chloride (Cl), magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) are present in gram per kilogram quantities. 

The remaining elements occur in seafood in much lower concentrations (mg or µg per kilogram 

quantities), like the trace elements copper (Cu), iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) and the ultra trace 

elements like fluoride (F), iodine (I), selenium (Se), silicon (Si), manganese (Mn), molybdenum 

(Mo), cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), vanadium (V) and nickel (Ni). All these elements are 

considered essential for human and animal life. Other elements presented in seafood are 

bromine (Br), strontium (Sr) and rubidium (Rb). They have also been claimed essential, but the 

physiological functions of these trace elements have not been clearly demonstrated or remain to 

be confirmed. The main functions of essential elements include formation of skeletal structure, 

maintenance of colloidal systems and regulation of acid-base equilibrium. They are important 

components of hormones, enzymes and enzyme activators (Lall, 1995). Generally, species 

have  the  following  descending  order  of  concentration:  K&gt;P&gt;Na&gt;Mg&gt;Ca&gt;Zn&gt;Fe&gt;Cu&gt;Mn. In

All the trace and ultra trace essential elements can be toxic when in high concentrations 

(Belitz et al., 2004). On the other hand, some elements like cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and 

mercury (Hg) show no known essential function in life and are toxic even at low concentration 

when ingested over a long period; therefore many consumers regard any presence of these 

elements in seafood as a hazard to health. These elements were present in the aquatic 

environment long before human beings existed (Oehlenschläger, 2002). Others can be toxic in 

a determined chemical form or presented varied toxicity depending on biological system 

(Fraústo da Silva, 1985). As the other seafood components, minerals concentration is species-

specific and can furthermore vary with biological aspects (size, age, sex, state of maturity) but 

also with diet, season and the environment. Most aquatic organisms accumulate and retain 

minerals from the environment. In what concerns farmed fish, the composition of commercial 

feeds used also influences their elemental composition. 

 

3.2.1 Essential elements 

3.2.1.1 Macro elements 

Electrolytes (K, Na and Cl) 

Sodium and Cl are the principal extracellular cation and anion, respectively, in the human 

body. Sodium is important in osmoregulation, acid-base balance and the membrane potential of 

cells, as well active transport across cell membranes (Lall, 1995). In addition, it activates some 

enzymes, such as amylase (Belitz et al., 2004). Chloride is essential in the maintenance of 

electrolyte balance and is also the most important anion in gastric juice (Lall, 1995). In diets, Cl 

and Na are necessary in equivalent levels on a molar basis. Potassium is localized mostly

within the cells. It regulates the osmotic pressure within the cell, is involved in cell membrane 

transport and also in the activation of a number of glycolytic and respiratory enzymes (Belitz et 

al., 2004). According to Institute of Medicine (IOM) (2005), in average, the dietary reference 

intake (DRI) for these three elements are 1500 mg/day for Na, 4700 mg/day for K and 2300 

mg/day for Cl. The intake of too little or too much of these three elements can result in serious 

disorders. From a nutritional point of view an excessive dose of Na is more plausible than its 

deficiency. Somme symptoms caused by an high consumption of Na are hypertension, 

weakness and edema (IOM, 2004). Chloride deficiency or excess are associated to Na. 

Generally, a deficiency of K do not show symptoms but a severe deficiency of this element can 

cause hypokalemia, characterized by muscle weakness, cardiac arritmia and glucose 

intolerance. An excess may enhance the appearance of hyperkalemia (IOM, 2004). 

Potassium is the most abundant mineral in seafood (Lall, 1995) and its concentration is 

always higher than that of Na (Belitz et al., 2004). Since the level of Na in seafood is relatively 

low, this kind of food is good for those consumers who need a low Na diet (Oehlenschläger, 

1997, Martinez-Valverde et al., 2000). Levels of K in marine fish are around 3500 mg/kg, 

however some species can reach 5000 mg/kg (Lall, 1995). Shellfish show the lowest K values, 

for example shrimps only attained a mean concentration of 1790 mg/kg (Nunes et al., 2008). 

Wide variations in the Na content of fishery products can be observed. Freshwater and marine 

fish present a Na average of 600 mg/kg while most shellfish have Na in the range of 1200-4000 

mg/kg. Data on distribution of Cl in seafood are scarce (Lall, 1995). In the study performed by 

Oehlenschläger (1997) on16 marine fish species from the North-East Atlantic, the levels were in 

the range of 400-1300 mg/kg. 

 

Structural elements (P and S) 

Phosphorous is an integral part of bone and tooth mineral as well as part of the structure of 

every cell (Pigott &amp;amp; Tucker, 1990). It is directly involved in energy-producing cellular reactions. 

Therefore, P plays an important role in overall metabolism as well as in various metabolic 

processes involving buffers in body fluids (Lall, 1995). Sulphur it is especially important for 

humans because it is part of the amino acid methionine, which is an absolute dietary 

requirement. The amino acid cysteine also contains S. This element also plays an important 

role in the health effects production of insulin, which keeps the blood sugar levels balanced. 

According to IOM (2005), in average, DRI for P is 700 mg/day. Dietary reference intake for S is 

about 800-1000 mg/day (Acu-cell Nutrition, 2010a). As P and S are found in most foods, 

deficiencies are uncommon. 

The best source of P and S are high-protein foods such as seafood. In general, the content of 

P in seafood is around 2000 mg/kg. Usually, equal amounts of these two elements were found 

in marine species (Oehlenschläger, 1997). Data collected by some authors (Lall, 1995; 

Oehlenschläger, 1997; Nunes et al., 2008) show a P mean concentration range of 1400-3000 

mg/kg being the small fatty pelagic fish the best source.

Calcium and Magnesium (Ca and Mg) 

Approximately 99 % of Ca is present in bones as calcium phosphate and hydroxyapatite. The 

remaining portions of Ca are found in extracellular fluids and intracellular structures and cell 

membranes. Calcium is involved in the structure of the muscular system and controls essential 

processes like muscle contraction, blood clotting, activity of brain cells and cell growth (Belitz et 

al., 2004). The distribution of Mg is similar to the distribution of Ca and P, the major proportion is 

being located in bone. The remainder is found within the cells of soft tissues (Lall, 1995). 

Magnesium is a prosthetic group in enzymes that hydrolyse and transfer phosphate groups. 

Consequently, it is essential for energy-requiring biological functions such as membrane 

transport, generation and transmission of nerve impulses, contraction of muscles and oxidative 

phosphorylation. It is also essential for the maintenance of ribosomal structure and thus protein 

synthesis (Lall, 1995). According to IOM (2005), in average, the DRI for these two elements are 

1000 mg/day for Ca and 420 mg/day for Mg. Symptoms of Ca deficiency are bone weakness, 

neuromuscular excitability and muscle spasms. Calcium excess can provoke kidney stones. 

Magnesium deficiency can cause neuromuscular irritability, muscle spasms and cardiovascular 

accidents. Furthermore, an excess of Mg can cause diarrhoea, anaesthesia and depression of 

central and peripheral nervous system (Fraústo da Silva, 1985). 

Despite of seafood muscle are considered poor source of these two elements, generally, 

seafood contains more Mg than Ca (Oehlenschläger, 1997). The average concentrations of Ca 

in most fish and shellfish muscle are in general inferior to 400 mg/kg but some species show 

wide differences due to variable amounts of bone and shell. Crustaceans contain more Ca than 

fish (Lall, 1995). The concentrations of Mg in the edible portion of most seafood ranged 

between 200 - 500 mg/kg. However, molluscs and crustaceans can showed levels around 2000 

mg/kg of Mg (Jodral-Segado et al., 2003). 

 

3.2.1.2 Trace elements  

Copper (Cu) 

Copper is a component of a number of oxidoreductase enzymes. As a cofactor for enzymes it 

is involved in glucose metabolism and the synthesis of haemoglobin, connective tissue and 

phospholipids (Lall, 1995). In blood plasma, it is bound to ceruloplasmin, which catalyzes the 

oxidation of Fe
2+

 to Fe
3+

. This reaction is of great importance since it is only the Fe
3+

 form in 

blood which is transported by the transferrin protein to the iron pool in the liver (Belitz et al., 

2004). Copper can have toxic effects in all alive organisms; however, it is not toxic for humans 

at low concentrations (Celik &amp;amp; Oehlenschläger, 2004). The average DRI for Cu is 0.9 mg/day 

(IOM, 2005). This value is normally supplied in a normal diet. A deficient diet in Cu may cause in 

humans, anaemia, Menke's syndrome in children, deficient keratinisation and pigmentation 

(insufficient production of melamine). An excess, in turn, can cause, among other problems, 

Wilson's disease, hepatic necrosis, cirrhosis and haemolytic crises (Fraústo da Silva, 1985). 



Background 

 

17 

The overall concentration of Cu in most seafood is around 2 mg/kg, with the exception of 

molluscs and crustaceans where the concentration can attain average values of 10 mg/kg, in 

crabs, or 80 mg/kg in oysters (Lall, 1995). 

Iron (Fe) 

Iron is present in all cells of living organisms and plays a vital role in several biochemical 

reactions. Most of Fe is present in the haemoglobin (blood) and myoglobin (muscle tissues) 

pigments, cytochromes and other proteins, participating in the transport, storage and utilization 

of oxygen (Lall,1995). This element is also present in a number of enzymes (peroxidase, 

catalase, hydroxilases and flavine enzymes), therefore is an essential element of the daily diet 

(Belitz et al., 2004). According to IOM (2005), in average, the DRI for this element is 8 mg/day, 

however, in order to provide a sufficient supply of Fe to persons who require higher amounts 

(children, women before menopause and pregnant or nursing women), the Fe DRI can reached 

up to 27 mg/day. Iron deficiency causes anaemia. On the other hand, hemochromatosis and 

thalassemia involve an excessive storage of iron probably caused by an excessive intake of 

supplements. Symptoms of acute toxicity are vomiting, diarrhoea and intestinal problems (Curry 

&amp;amp; Liu, 2010). 

Total content of Fe in seafood can vary greatly. Usually, Fe fish concentrations are lower than 

10 mg/kg. Nevertheless, fish species with a high amount of dark muscle, as pelagic ones 

(sardine, mackerel, tuna, etc.), contain more Fe than others fish species, attaining 30 mg/kg, 

due to the high level of Fe in dark muscle (Lall, 1995). Species like crustaceans can also have 

amounts higher than 10 mg/kg (Lall, 1995). 

Zinc (Zn) 

Zinc is an essential element for humans. Its essential function is based on its role as an 

integral part of a number of metalloenzymes and as a catalyst for regulating the activity of 

specific zinc-dependent enzymes (Lall, 1995). According to IOM (2005), in average, the DRI for 

this element is 8 mg/day. A deficient diet in Zn can lead to the occurrence of diseases such as 

anorexia, stunting, parakeratosis, alopecia, hypogonadism, and delayed healing. On the other 

hand an excess of Zn can cause metal fume fever (fever, chills) (Fraústo da Silva, 1985). Zinc 

poisoning has been reported as a result of consumption of soured food kept in zinc-plated-metal 

containers (Belitz et al., 2004). 

This element is present in fish and other seafood in mg/kg amounts and there have been no 

reports of concentrations in the edible parts of seafood that form a hazard to health 

(Oehlenschläger, 2002). In general, fish have low Zn contents when compared to molluscs and 

crustaceans. Fish muscle has an average of about 3-5 mg/kg of zinc, while molluscs and 

crustaceans can reach much higher values. Oysters for example can display average values of 

850 mg/kg (Lall, 1995).

3.2.1.3 Ultra trace elements  

Chromium (Cr) 

Chromium is considered an essential nutrient for humans. It may have a role in activating 

enzymes and in maintaining the structural stability of proteins and nucleic acids, but the primary 

physiological role of Cr is to enhance insulin action (Lall, 1995; Vincent, 2004) by activating the 

enzyme phosphoglucomutase (Belitz et al., 2004). Trivalent Cr and its salts are usually the most 

stable form of Cr and the main form found in plants and animals (FDA, 1993a). The hexavalent 

Cr salts are less stable and more biologically reactive. This last form causes allergic reactions 

and has neurotoxic and carcinogenic effects (Racek, 2003). According to IOM (2005), in 

average, the DRI for this element is 35 µg/day. This value can be surpassed with a diet in 

seafood however, in agreement to Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN) (Hathcock, 2004) Cr 

supplements at levels up to 1,000 µg per day are regarded as safe for adults. The symptoms of 

Cr deficiency caused by long-term total parenteral nutrition are severely impaired glucose 

tolerance, a loss of weight, and confusion. Because of the high excretion rates and the very low 

absorption rates of most forms of Cr, acute toxicity is uncommon. 

The Cr content in fish was reported to be between 0.02 and 0.5 mg/kg (Oehlenschläger, 

1997). However, levels as high as 5 or 12 mg/kg have been found in molluscs and crustacean 

edible tissues (Lall, 1995). Generally, the edible part of the muscle contains lower levels of Cr 

than liver and other organs. 

Manganese (Mn) 

One of the functions of Mn is as a cofactor activating a large number of enzymes such as 

arginase, amino peptidase, alkaline phosphatase, lecithinase or enolase (Belitz et al., 2004). 

Since the chemistry of Mn ion is similar to that of the Mg ion, many enzymes can be activated 

by either Mn or Mg however, certain enzymes, for example, glycosyl tansferases are highly 

specific for Mn activation (Lall, 1995). Manganese can also be an integral part of some 

metalloenzymes (for example pyruvate oxidase) (Fraústo da Silva, 1985). Moreover, Mn is also 

necessary in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and brain function (Lall, 1995). According to 

IOM (2005), in average, the DRI for Mn is 1.8 mg/day. Only a small part of Mn is absorved by 

diet (IOM, 2001) and even in higher amounts, Mn is relatively non toxic (Belitz et al., 2004). 

However, an excessive intake can lead to mental disorders (manganese madness) (Fraústo da 

Silva, 1985). Its deficiency can cause bone deformities, sterility and ataxia. 

Seafood is not a good source of Mn and is considered a minor component (Oehlenschläger, 

1997). Most muscle fish contain 0.1 to 0.4 mg/kg (Lall, 1995), nonetheless molluscs and 

crustaceans contain significantly higher levels than fish (Lall, 1995). Subsequently, seafood only 

contributes to the DRI with a minor percentage. 

Nickel (Ni) 

Nickel is an essential nutrient that is only required in very small amountsThis metal is present in 

some biologic molecules such as enzymes urease and CO dehydrogenase (Fraústo da Silva, 

1985). Nickel also enhances insulin activity (Belitz et al., 2004). Its absorption into the body is 

affected by factors of consumption, the acidity of the gut, and various binding or competing

19 

substances, including other minerals such as Ca, Fe, Mg and Zn (Curry &amp;amp; Liu, 2010). According 

to IOM (2005), in average, the DRI for this element is 0.5 mg/day. Nickel deficiency is rare due 

to the low level of requirement, and its relatively high availability in the diet, but experiments 

have shown that at a cellular level, Ni deprivation results in changes in the membrane 

properties and other structures. Deficiency has also been associated with low blood glucose 

levels, abnormal bone growth, altered metabolism of Ca and vitamin B12 and poor absorption of 

ferric iron (Curry &amp;amp; Liu, 2010). Nickel toxicity is usually not a problem unless several grams are 

ingested from non-dietary sources. The toxicity of Ni is classified into four categories: allergies, 

cancer, non-malignant respiratory disorders and iatrogenic poisoning (FDA, 1993b).  

For the common population the major source of Ni is the diet. Nickel is widely distributed in 

foods. The concentration of Ni in seafood varies, depending of species and polluted or non-

polluted catch area. In general, molluscs and crustaceans have higher values than fish species. 

Levels can range from 0.02 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg (Carvalho et al., 2005; Sivaperumal et al., 2007). 

Selenium (Se) 

Selenium is recognized both as an essential trace element and a toxic agent. It is an integral 

component of the enzyme glutathione peroxidase (GSH) (selenoprotein) in human and animal 

tissues, which, together with vitamin E and the enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase, 

acts as an antioxidant, thereby protecting cells against oxidative damage (Lall, 1995). It is also 

involved in thyroid metabolism through iodothyroninedeiodinase enzyme and is needed for the 

proper functioning of the immune system (Sirichakwal et al., 2005). The presence of Se reduces 

the availability of metal ions (such as mercury and cadmium), blocking them in insoluble 

compounds, which is a process of great importance (Lall, 1995; Plessi et al., 2001; Feroci et al., 

2005). As a result, a deficiency of Se increases the toxicity caused by those metals. In addition, 

Se deficiency has been reported to cause an overload of Fe and unbalanced distributions of 

other elements in vivo, such as Mg, Ca, Cu and Zn (Feroci et al., 2005). On the other hand, 

excessive ingestion or inhalation of Se can be toxic to man and animals, although in humans its 

occurrence is rare. The symptoms include depression, nervousness, and dermatitis, garlic 

odour of the breath, gastrointestinal disturbances, and excessive tooth decay (Sivaperumal et 

al., 2007). According to IOM (2005), the average DRI for this element is 55 µg/day. 

Seafood contains substantially higher levels of Se than red meats and poultry and is thus 

considered one of the major dietary sources of this element in addition to cereal and dried fruit 

(Lall, 1995). Among seafood, marine fish are the best source. The Se content is quite constant 

and varies little between species (Oehlenschläger, 1997). Reported values are about 0.2 – 1.0 

mg/kg (Lall, 1995; Oehlenschläger, 1997; Carvalho et al., 2005; Sirichakwal et al., 2005; Garg &amp;amp; 

Ramakrishna, 2006; Sivaperumal et al., 2007). Dietary reference intake can be easily reached 

in a normal seafood diet.

3.2.2 Non-essential elements? 

3.2.2.1 Bromine (Br) 

Bromine is one of the most abundant and ubiquitous within the recognized trace elements in 

the biosphere. This element has not been conclusively shown to perform any essential function 

in plants, microrganisms and animals (Pavelka, 2004) since not enough information is available 

about the metabolism of bromide ion, the most common form of this element. However, 

inorganic bromide can exert both therapeutic as well as the toxic effects (Pavelka, 2004). It is 

proved that in thyroid gland, bromide replace iodide (Pavelka, 2004). In this way, seafood that 

are a source of bromine and iodine, and depending on their bromine/iodine ratio and whether 

someone is hypothyroid or hyperthyroid, it can have beneficial or unfavourable effect on thyroid 

functions when regularly consumed. There is no DRI established for Br, nevertheless, 1 – 3 mg 

per day is an estimated median daily intake of Br for food and water (Acu-cell Nutrition, 2010b). 

Bromine data on seafood are sparse, however according to some authors the average Br 

concentration in fish is about 2 mg/kg, while in molluscs and crustaceans can reach much 

higher values (Varo, 1992; Barrento et al., 2009). 

 

3.2.2.2 Rubidium (Rb) 

Rubidium, a rarely studied alkali metal, may be an essential ultra trace element for humans 

and other organisms (Campbell et al., 2005). However, the circumstantial evidence supporting 

Rb essentiality is still limited. Rubidium deficiency in goats reportedly results in depressed food 

intake, growth, and life expectancy and increased spontaneous absorption (Anke &amp;amp; Angelow, 

1995) These finding with goats are complemented by earlier reports that Rb can possibly acts 

as a nutritional substitute for K in some functions, especially in lower forms of life (Nielsen, 

2000). Since this element is relatively non toxic and is not associated with any chronic disease, 

it has not received any media attention or supplement industry. The typical daily dietary intake 

of Rb of 1 to 5 mg probably ca be considered safe and, if essential, adequate (Nielsen, 2000). 

Very little information exists in regard on the concentrations and distribution of Rb in 

freshwater and marine food webs (Campbell et al., 2005). A study performed by Carvalho et al. 

(2005) reported values around 2 mg/kg (dry weight) in some fish species and octopus eaten in 

Portugal.  

 

3.2.2.3 Strontium (Sr)  

There is some difficulty regarding the classification of this metal relatively to its essentiality. 

The human body absorbs Sr as if it is Ca and due to the chemical similarity, the stable forms of 

Sr might not pose a significant health threat. In fact, the levels found naturally may actually be 

beneficial. There is a long history of medical research regarding strontium's benefits, beginning 

in the 1950s (Wikipedia, 2010a). Studies indicate a lack of undesirable side-effects, and for that 

the evidence that Sr is essential to human health is complex. Nevertheless, recent studies show 

that adequate doses of specific essential nutrients, including Sr, prevent and fight against 

osteoporosis. This mineral is clinically effective in preventing fractures and bone loss and 



Background 

 

21 

increases bone mineral density. Medical literature suggests that a judicious use of low doses of 

Sr (for example some compounds of Sr, as strontium ranelate, gluconate, carbonate, lactate 

and chlorate) can be an effective and safe way to assist patients in restoring and maintaining 

bone health (Meunier et al., 2004; Genuis &amp;amp; Schwalfenberg, 2007).
 
It also seems to have an 

effective role in dental caries being strontium chloride used as part of some toothpastes 

formulation (Acu-cell Nutrition, 2010c). There is no DRI established for Sr, nevertheless, 1 – 5 

mg per day is an estimated median daily intake of Sr for food and water (Acu-cell Nutrition, 

2010c). 

Studies on contents of Sr in seafood are scarce. Generally, fish present lower amounts of Sr 

(1-5 mg/kg) than molluscs and crustaceans (Segar et al., 1971; Teeny et al., 1984; Vlieg et al., 

1991; Garg &amp;amp; Ramakrishna, 2006) being the highest values found in crustaceans (Barrento et 

al., 2008). 

 

3.2.3 Toxic elements 

Despite of the indisputable nutritional value of seafood, these products can accumulate in 

their edible part some pollutants. Among these pollutants it can be detached the dioxins, 

polychlorinated biphenyl compounds (PCBs) and toxic elements like Hg, Cd, Pb and arsenic 

(As) (Fremy &amp;amp; Bordet, 2002). The danger of their presence in the marine environment implies 

not only the toxicity of proper environment but also a considerable level of these pollutants in 

the trophic chain, which may constitute a risk for the human health (Burger &amp;amp; Gochfeld, 2005). 

The presence and concentration of toxic elements in the aquatic environment, including biota, 

specifically in seafood which are used for human diet is based both on natural and 

anthropogenic sources (Oehlenschläger, 2002). Natural levels of these elements are due to 

marine volcanism, geological anomalies and geothermal events while anthropogenic are  

principally related with intensive metallurgy. Fish and other seafood have always contained 

certain amounts of toxic elements as a consequence of habitat. In open seas, unaffected by 

pollution, seafood mostly carries just the natural burden of toxic elements content. In polluted 

areas, in waters which have no sufficient exchange with the world oceans, in estuaries, in rivers 

and especially in places which are close to sites of industrial activities, the concentrations of 

toxic elements exceed the natural load (Oehlenschläger, 2002). The main reasons of the toxicity 

of elements derive from the fact that many of these can replace metals in active sites of 

enzymes, bind to other radicals of enzymes and other biological molecules, replacing certain 

groups in biological molecules, complexing or forming precipitates with enzyme metals or other 

groups involved in metabolism, catalyzing the breakdown of essential metabolites, combined 

with membranes, altering their permeability, and replace elements with electrochemical 

functions (Fraústo da Silva, 1985; Goyer, 1997). Mercury, Cd, Pb and As are cumulative toxic 

that can be assimilated, stored and concentrated by living organisms through the food chain, 

causing sometimes serious physiological effects. The animals are usually more sensitive to 

contamination by toxic metals than plants, and humans are considered the most sensitive and 

the most important target species. Since 2001, there are legal limits for Cd, Pb and Hg,

proposed by EU, for fish muscle in general, for some particular fishes, for crustaceans and for 

molluscs (EU, 2006, 2008). Moreover, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee for Food 

Additives (JECFA) has recommended the provisional tolerable weekly intakes (PTWI) (WHO, 

1999; 2003a). Table 3.6 summarizes these values for As, Cd, Pb and Hg and some usually 

contents in seafood.

To evaluate the importance of studying the content of some toxic elements in the studied 

species, is made subsequently a brief approach to these elements. 

 

3.2.3.1 Arsenic (As) 

Arsenic is an important and ubiquitous non-metal element which has become one of the toxic 

trace elements under concern in recent decades (Karadjova et al., 2007). The toxicity of As 

depends on its oxidation state and molecular form. For example As (III) is more toxic than As 

(V), while arsenobetaine and arsenocholine, arseno-organic compounds, are relatively non-toxic 

(Storeli &amp;amp; Marcotrigiano, 2000; ATSDR, 2007a). The high intakes of inorganic As, mainly due to 

chronic exposure to elevated levels in drinking water are associated with several toxic effects 

including increased risk of numerous types of cancer (IOM, 2001; Belitz et al., 2004; ATSDR, 

2007a). Studies performed in chickens, rats and goats were done to test As essentiality (Belitz 

et al., 2004). Its deficiency in goats appears to cause growth alterations, reproduction problems, 

milk production and sudden dead (McDonald et al., 2002). Its metabolic role is not yet 

understood. It appears to be involved in the metabolism of methionine. Choline can be replaced 

by arsenocholine in some of its functions (Belitz et al., 2004). The general population may be

exposed to As in air, drinking water, and food, but human intake of As occurs mainly via food  

chain, and it is loosely related to the consumption of seafood (Figure 3.2). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 3.2 - Schematic representation of the cycle of arsenic in the environment. (Picture source 

site: GDR, 2009). 

 

Marine organisms are known to accumulate total As in the range of 1 – 100 mg/kg from their 

environment and food sources. The majority of As is present as organoarsenic species, 

metabolised from inorganic As present in seawater or accumulated from food sources such as 

algae or other fish. Providentially, arsenobetaine is the major component (typically more than 90 

% present As) in a variety of seafood products and it is considered as a non-toxic compound 

(Ackley, et al., 1999; Muñoz et al., 2000; Cava-Montesinos et al., 2005). In EU no legal limits for 

the As levels in seafood have been established so far. Nevertheless, the Food and Drug 

Administration (FDA) suggests a limit of 76 mg/kg for crustaceans (FDA, 1993c) and the World 

Health Organization (WHO) recommends a tolerable daily intake of 0.05 mg As/kg body weight 

from food (WHO, 1983). 

 

3.2.3.2 Cadmium (Cd) 

Cadmium is an industrial and environmental pollutant that affects adversely a number of 

organs in humans. It is also a natural element in the earth´s crust. It is usually found as a 

mineral combined with other elements such as oxygen (cadmium oxide), chlorine (cadmium 

chloride), or sulphur (cadmium sulphate, cadmium sulphide) (ATSDR, 2008). Anthropogenic 

sources of Cd include mining operations, metallurgical industries, the corrosion of galvanized 

zinc, industrial production of batteries and the application of fertilizer and sewage sludge to farm 

land (Fraústo da Silva, 1985; Goyer &amp;amp; Clarkson, 2001; Castro-González &amp;amp; Méndez-Armenta, 

2008; ATSDR, 2008). In foods of animal origin, and as happens in humans, Cd is found mainly 

in internal organs like the liver and kidney (Goyer &amp;amp; Clarkson, 2001; ATSDR, 2008; Castro-

González &amp;amp; Méndez-Armenta, 2008). This metal interacts with the metabolism of four essential 

elements: Zn, Fe, Ca and Cu (Goyer, 1997; Peraza et al., 1998). Another important nutritional 

aspect of Cd is its interaction with the sulphydryl -rich protein, metallothioneins (MT).  

Table 3.7 summarizes the major Cd interactions with some elements.

Cadmium-zinc interactions There are many similarities between Cd and Zn. Both metals 

are members of the group IIB in periodic table and both have a similar tendency to form 

tetrahedral complexes and therefore it seems that the two metals have similar interactions with 

the human body (Peraza et al., 1998; Brzóska &amp;amp; Moniuszko-Jakoniuk, 2001). Cadmium has an 

inhibitory effect on the activity of Zn-containing enzymes such as carboxypeptidase and ?-

mannosidase. Zinc is also replaced by Cd in MT. Some of the symptoms of chronic Cd toxicity 

are similar to those of Zn deficiency. In both cases, growth failure, parakeratotic lesions and 

impaired glucose tolerance occurs. 

Cadmium-iron interactions The development of anaemia is one of the symptoms associated 

with Cd intoxication. This is a result of the inhibitory effect of Cd on Fe metabolism and 

absorption. Cadmium decreases hematocrit and haemoglobin levels in exposed workers. 

Ferritin or transferrin could be involved in the Cd-Fe interaction observed during Cd intoxication 

(Peraza et al., 1998). 

Cadmium-calcium interactions Cadmium toxicity affects Ca metabolism, and individuals 

with severe Cd nephropathy may have renal calculi and excess excretion of Ca, probably 

related to increases urinary loss. Associated skeletal changes are probably related to Ca loss 

and include bone pain, osteomalacia, and/or osteoporosis. Bone changes are part of Itai-Itai 

disease, a syndrome recognizes in postmenopausal multiparous women living in the Funchu 

area of Japan prior to and during World War II. The syndrome consists of severe bone 

deformities and chronic renal disease (Peraza et al., 1998; Goyer &amp;amp; Clarkson, 2001). 



Background 

 

25 

Cadmium-copper interactions The most obvious disturbance in Cu metabolism caused by 

Cd is the reduced plasma ceruloplasmin concentrations. Ceruloplasmin is the protein 

responsible for transporting Cu throughout the circulatory system. Another explanation for the 

Cd-Cu interaction is that the two metals compete for binding sites on MT. Copper displaces Cd 

from MT because of its higher affinity for the protein (Peraza et al., 1998). 

Cadmium-metallothionein interactions The accumulation of Cd in the kidneys to some 

extent without apparent toxic effect is possible because of the formation of Cd-thionein or 

metallothionein, a metal-protein complex with a low molecular weight. Metallothionein is 

primarily a tissue protein and is ubiquitous in most organs, but it exists in the highest 

concentration in the liver, particularly following recent exposure to Cd, and in the kidneys, where 

it accumulates with age in proportion to Cd concentration. Cadmium bound to metallothionein 

within tissues is fortuitous result of the chemical similarity between Cd and the essential trace 

metals (Peraza et al., 1998; Goyer &amp;amp; Clarkson, 2001). 

Cadmium-selenium interactions Nutritional studies have shown that Se offers some 

protection against acute Cd-induced toxicity. The protective role of Se probably come into play 

by the shifting of Cd binding from MT to higher molecular-weight proteins. This allows MT to be 

unencumbered and therefore able to bind essential nutrients such as Zn and Cu (Peraza et al., 

1998). 

Hypertension, neurological disorders and carcinogenicity Some epidemiologic studies 

suggest that Cd is an etiologic agent for essential hypertension, others suggested a relationship 

between abnormal behaviour and/or decreased intelligence in children and adults exposed to 

Cd and still other studies have shown a relationship between occupational (respiratory) 

exposure to Cd and lung cancer and possibly prostate cancer (Goyer &amp;amp; Clarkson, 2001; Castro-

González &amp;amp; Méndez-Armenta, 2008). 

Cadmium pathway to humans occurs mainly through two sources. One source is through 

inhalation of Cd particles during industrial or everyday activities, among which the inhaled Cd
2+

 

from cigarette should be considered as highly hazardous because Cd is easily absorbed by the 

lungs (Goyer, 1997; Castro-González &amp;amp; Méndez-Armenta, 2008). Another is the oral route 

through water and food contaminated with Cd, particularly leafy vegetables, grains, cereals, 

fruits, organ meat, and seafood. 

Cadmium content in fish muscle is generally low, ranging between 0.01 to 0.1 mg / kg wet 

weight (Francesconi, 2007), however it may be deposited in greater quantities in fish organs like 

kidneys and liver. These organs can be deeply contaminated and should preferably not be 

consumed (Oehlenschläger, 2002). However, the situation with marine invertebrates like 

molluscs and crustaceans is different. Molluscs, especially cephalopods, are active Cd 

accumulators (Bustamante et al., 1998). Cephalopods, like octopus, squid or cuttlefish can store 

large amounts of Cd in their intestines while their mantle and tentacle contain less amount 

(Oehlenschläger, 2002). If the elimination of all intestines is not done from cephalopods 

immediately after catch, Cd can migrate from the intestines into the muscle tissue. Probably, the 

Cd level in these muscle tissues will surpass the legal limits. Some bivalve molluscs can also 



Background 

 

26 

have high contents of Cd and the levels must be regularly monitored. The higher Cd content in 

molluscs is the justification for higher legal limits of Cd for this group of seafood.  

 

3.2.3.3 Mercury (Hg) 

Mercury is one of the most important pollutants both because of its effect on marine 

organisms and because it is potentially hazardous to humans (Storelli et al., 2003). This 

element may occur naturally in the environment (mineral, deposits, volcanoes, forest fires, 

oceanic emission, and crust degassing) or be released  by human activities such as agriculture 

industry (fungicides, seed preservatives), mining, mineral processing and combustion of fossil 

fuels, by pharmaceuticals, as pulp and paper preservatives, catalysts in organic syntheses, in 

thermometers and batteries, in amalgams and in chlorine and caustic soda production (Renzoni 

et al., 1998; Oehlenschläger, 2002). The toxicology and the environmental behaviour of Hg are 

complex, since its toxicity, mobility, and bioaccumulation depend on its chemical form (Storelli et 

al., 2003), elemental or metallic, inorganic or organic. Figure 3.3 shows the main aspects of the 

biogeochemical cycle of Hg. Mercury in the atmosphere can be transported over great 

distances, so even areas without natural or anthropogenic sources of Hg, the contamination 

may be present, and thus it is a global pollution problem. In the atmosphere, almost all Hg is in 

elemental form (Hg
0
). By reaction with ozone and OH radicals, the Hg

0
 is oxidized to Hg

2+
, being 

less volatile, it condenses and is deposited. In aquatic ecosystems, the Hg
2+

 can be reduced to 

Hg
0
, returning to the atmosphere, or biotransformed into organic forms. Biotransformation is the 

methylation of Hg
2+

 by sulphate-reducing bacteria, which live in conditions of anoxia, usually in 

the sediment or the water column (EPA, 2001).

Background 

 

27 

The organic compound that is formed is usually the monometylmercury (CH3Hg
+ 

- MeHg) 

which, besides being the most toxic form, is quite stable and it is absorbed easily during 

digestion and accumulates in aquatic organisms. It also enters fish bodies directly through their 

skin and gills. Beyond MeHg methylation of Hg (II), it can also be produced dimethylmercury 

(CH3)2Hg) that is quite volatile, and does not accumulate in aquatic organisms (Augelli et al., 

2007). 

Elemental Hg is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but is almost completely 

absorbed through respiratory tract, rapidly crossing the blood-brain barrier and causing 

neurotoxity. Its vapour accounts for most occupational mercury exposures. At the cellular level 

the dissolved vapour is oxidized to Hg
2+

, which causes nephrotoxiity (Peraza et al., 1998; Goyer 

&amp;amp; Clarkson, 2001, Hajeb et al., 2009). Inorganic Hg is hydrophilic and thus is the most 

nephrotoxic form, affecting mainly the straight segment of the proximal tubule. The mechanism 

of toxicity of inorganic Hg is by impairing mitochondrial function. Mercury possibly promotes 

mitochondrial membrane leakage and increases mitochondrial oxygen consumption with 

subsequent increased production of hydrogen peroxide (Peraza et al., 1998). The mercuric ion 

also has a high activity for ligands containing sulfhydryl groups, strongly inhibiting the activity of 

enzymes that contain those groups (Hajeb et al., 2009). The mercuric chloride is the inorganic 

salt whose toxicity is well known. Its oral ingestion causes severe abdominal pain, bloody 

diarrhea and suppression of urine. Ulceration, haemorrhage and necrosis gastrointestinal tract 

is accompanied by a circulatory collapse (Goyer &amp;amp; Clarkson, 2001). 

The MeHg organometallic species is a lipophilic compound easily absorbed. It crosses the 

blood brain barrier and placenta and reacts with their target organs, the tissues of the brain, 

being a neurotoxic agent that affects the development of the nervous system, resulting in 

psychological disturbance, impaired hearing, loss of sight, ataxia, loss of motor control and 

general debilitation (Storeli et al., 2005). It also causes blockage of binding sites of enzymes, 

interferes in protein synthesis, hampers thymidine incorporation into DNA (Uría &amp;amp; Sanz-Medel, 

1998). The MeHg suffers biotransformation to compounds of Hg (II) in tissues, by breaking the 

carbon-mercury (Goyer &amp;amp; Clarkson, 2001). Various studies suggest that disruption of the 

molecule MeHg causes the formation of free radicals, which affect the lipid membranes of 

neurons, leading to their damage. This situation should not be strange that the toxic effects of 

MeHg might be reduced by antioxidants such as selenium (Lall, 1995; Sivaperumal et al., 

2007). The MeHg also has a high affinity for sulphydryl groups and, therefore, the complexes 

with SH groups, in which the amino acid cysteine is particularly rich, serve ligand and provide 

transport of Hg in blood and central nervous system (Carvalho et al., 2005; Hajeb et al., 2009). 

One of the most notable cases of MeHg poisoning occurred in Minamata Bay (Japan) between 

1932 and 1968, after discharges by an industrial unit in the bay, causing a high number of 

victims, and for that reason known as Minamata disease. Also in Iraq, between 1971 and 1972, 

one of the most serious cases was due to the consumption of bread made with seeds that had 

been treated with MeHg to prevent fungal growth. The peasants to get rid of contaminated 

seed, threw them in rivers and lakes, contaminating the water and aquatic organisms. This 



Background 

 

28 

resulted in the deaths of more than five thousand people and another 100 000 were disabled 

(Virtanen et al., 2007; Afonso et al., 2007).  

Several nutrients have been found to affect the toxicity of Hg. Of these, Se has been the most 

widely studied. In general, Se has a protective effect, delaying the onset of mercury toxicity or 

reduces the severity of the effects of both inorganic forms of Hg and MeHg (Goyer, 1997). 

Selenium protection against inorganic Hg may involve a variety of mechanisms such as the 

direct stoichiometric complexing of Hg to reduce its availability. The reduction of Hg availability 

has not been proven because Hg levels are not decreased by Se. It may possible that Se 

interferes with the metabolism of inorganic Hg by reacting with the mercuric ion to form a 

compound that is less toxic than the mercuric ion. Selenium influences the oxidation rate of Hg
0
 

to mercuric ions that seems to be species dependent. The protection of Se against MeHg is not 

clear. Methylmercury is degraded to mercuric ion. The rate of this process is also species 

dependent. Selenium may protect against MeHg as described for inorganic Hg (Peraza et al., 

1998). There may also be another protective mechanism involving Se. When MeHg is degraded 

to inorganic Hg, the methyl moiety can also be further degraded by homolyis to methyl free 

radicals. These molecules may initiate a chain reaction peroxidation of various lipid 

constituents. Selenium-dependent GSH protects the cells by catalyzing the reduction of 

hydrogen peroxide and other organic hydroperoxides to products of greater stability (Peraza et 

al., 1998). Another nutrient that protect against MeHg toxicity is vitamin E. The mechanism of 

action of vitamin E is that of a scavenger of radicals that otherwise initiate MeHg breakdown. 

Vitamin E also can react with methyl radicals that might be formed in the breakdown. 

Nevertheless, the most effective action of vitamin E may be related to its location in the cell 

membranes and to its ability to stabilize membranes by interacting with unsaturated fatty acid 

chains (Peraza et al., 1998). 

Methylmercury bioaccumulates in the aquatic food chain and is found in all species of fish and 

fish-eating animals. In humans, the major exposure to MeHg also occurs via food, with the 

major sources being fish and fish products. Almost 100 % of the Hg present in fish is MeHg. 

The highest concentrations are found in large and old predatory fish, such as sharks, swordfish, 

tuna and pike (Virtanen et al., 2007). The occurrence of Hg in seafood is a common subject for 

human health risk evaluation and is of particular concern to the food agencies. The combination 

of the metal concentrations obtained in the seafood products analyzed and the consumption 

information permits to estimate the dietary intake. To evaluate the health risk of this estimated 

dietary exposure it have to be compared with the PTWI that are recommended by JECFA: 5 µg 

Hg/kg body weight (WHO, 1999), no more than 1.6 µg MeHg/kg body weight (WHO, 2003a). In 

order to support in the accuracy of such recommendations, total Hg of marketed seafood is 

regulated. Maximum allowable levels differ between countries. Actually, EU established a level 

of 0.50 mg/kg wet weight for the majority of fishes and 1.0 mg/kg wet weight for those species 

that are recognized as naturally accumulating elevated levels of Hg (large, long-lived, 

carnivorous fishes) (EU, 2006, 2008).

With all this information is therefore important, the assessment of Hg levels in fishery products 

not only as a factor of toxicologically, but also for the assessment of potential impacts on public 

health (Muñoz et al., 2005). 

 

3.2.3.4 Lead (Pb) 

Lead is a naturally-occurring bluish-gray metal that is rarely found in its elemental form, but 

occurs in the Earth´s crust primarily as the mineral galena (PbS), and to a lesser extent as 

anglesite (PbSO4) and cerussite (PbCO3). This metal is not a particularly abundant element, but 

its ore deposits are readily accessible and widely distributed throughout the world. Its 

properties, such as corrosion resistance, density, and low melting point, make it a familiar metal 

in pipes, solder, weights, and storage batteries (ATSDR, 2007b). The principal routes of 

exposure for general population is food and environmental sources. These sources include Pb 

based indoor paint in old dwellings, in dust, in contaminated drinking water, in air from 

combustion of Pb-containing industrial emissions, hand-to-mouth activities of young children 

living in polluted areas, Pb-glazed pottery, and, less commonly, Pb dust brought home by 

industrial workers on their shoes and clothes (Goyer &amp;amp; Clarkson, 2001). Because of health 

concerns, Pb from paints and ceramic products, caulking, and pipe solder has been 

dramatically reduced in recent years. The use of Pb as an additive to gasoline was also banned 

in most countries of the world (Goyer, 1997; ATSDR, 2007b). Actually, 95-98 % of all Pb 

present in the environment can be traced back to anthropogenic activities (Oehlenschläger, 

2002). Lead toxicity affects several organs systems, including the nervous, haematopoietic, 

renal, endocrine, and skeletal, depending on the age of the subject and the size of the dose, but 

the effect of major concern is the impairment of cognitive and behavioural development in 

infants and young children (Goyer, 1997; Castro-González &amp;amp; Méndez-Armenta, 2008). Lead 

can bind covalently to organic ligand such as alkyl groups forming stable organometallic 

compounds as tetraethyl Pb (used as a gasoline additive). These forms can easily cross the cell 

membrane by diffusion, accumulating particularly in tissues rich in lipid structures. In humans, 

organic forms cross the blood brain barrier and affect the central nervous system (Goyer &amp;amp; 

Clarkson, 2001).The symptoms of Pb poisining are headache, irritability, abdominal pain and 

various symptoms related to the nervous system (Järup, 2003). Chronic Pb toxicity in humans 

often develop dullness, irritability, poor attention span, epigastria, constipation, vomiting, 

convulsions, coma and death. Children may be affected by encephalopathy with lethargy, 

mental dullness, vomiting, irritability, and anorexia; in severe cases, the prolonged exposition of 

Pb can decrease the cognitive function and increase behaviour disorders, specially aggression, 

psychosis, confusion and mental deficit (Järup, 2003; ATSDR, 2007b). Blood Pb level indicates 

a recent exposure, whereas bone Pb level, which forms 90-95 % of Pb burden in adults and 80-

95 % of total Pb in children indicates a chronic exposure (Kakkar &amp;amp; Jaffery, 2005).  

Nutritional deficiencies of essential elements can increase the hazard from Pb exposure by 

enhancing absorption and toxicity of dietary Pb. The essential elements with the most market 



Background

influence on Pb levels and toxic effects are Ca, Fe and Zn. Table 3.8 summarizes the major Pb 

interactions with some elements. 

 

Table 3.8 - Major Pb interactions with micronutrients (Adapted from Peraza et al., 1998). 

Metal nutrient Interaction and mechanism Effects of nutrient on metal toxicity 

Pb - Ca Competes for binding sites on 

intestinal mucosal proteins 

Sufficiency decreases GI* absorption 

of Pb and decreases concentration of 

Pb in critical organs 

Pb - Fe Competes for Fe transport 

systems (i.e. ferritin) of the 

intestine 

Supplementation may decrease Pb 

absorption and toxicity (i.e. 

haematopoiesis depression) 

Pb - Zn Competes for GI uptake Supplementation decreases Pb GI 

absorption, decreases Pb tissue 

accumulation, and thus decreases Pb 

toxicity (i.e. inhibitory effects on ?-

ALAD**) 

*GI - Gastrointestinal; **?-ALAD - ?-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase. 

 

Lead-calcium interactions There are several suggestions in the lead toxicity literature that 

the two metals are metabolically related (Goyer, 1997). These interactions occur at the cellular 

and molecular levels and are a result of the ability of Pb to mimic or  displace Ca during specific 

physiologic processes. For example, Pb can block Ca efflux from cells by substituting for Ca in 

Ca
2+

/Na
+
 adenosine triphosphate (ATP) pumps. Although it is not possible to mimic the animal 

studies in people, balance studies conducted by several authors (Goyer, 1997) shows an 

inverse relationship between dietary Ca and Pb absorption and retention. However, there is little 

information regarding the effect of excess Ca, on Pb absorption. 

Lead-iron interactions Iron deficiency also enhances Pb absorption and promotes Pb 

toxicity. This is more evident in pregnant women and young children that are more susceptible 

to dietary Pb (Peraza et al., 1998). Lead inhibits two major enzymes of the heme biosynthetic 

pathway: ?-ALAD and ferrochelatase. Lead also interferes with mitochondrial energy 

metabolism, which is necessary to reduce ferric ion to ferrous ion before insertion of Fe into the 

porphyrin ring. When Fe deficiency is present ferrochelatase is more sensitive to these effects 

of Pb and results in depression of haematopoiesis. Therefore, iron supplementation may 

prevent this toxic effect of Pb on haematopoiesis (Peraza et al., 1998, Goyer &amp;amp; Clarkson, 2001). 

Lead-zinc interactions These interactions are not so well defined as those between Pb and 

Ca or Pb and Fe. Their is a close inverse relationship between blood Pb and activity of Zn-

containing heme enzymes, particularly ?-ALAD, which suggests that Pb replaces Zn in these 

enzymes (Goyer, 1997). 

The Pb content in fish muscle from fish that is caught in the open sea is very low, amounting 

to 2 – 10 µg/kg. The uptake of Pb through the food chain is of little importance since the 

concentration of Pb in fish does not increase with trophic level and age but rises with increasing 

concentration in water (Oehlenschläger, 2002). Elevated Pb content in muscle tissue is reported 

only from areas with intensive industrial and agriculture activities and input of untreated 



Background 

 

31 

municipal and industrial waste waters (Oehlenschläger, 2002). In invertebrates as molluscs and 

crustaceans, Pb levels can be higher than in fish and can reach values of approximately 1 

mg/kg. This is caused by an active accumulation of Pb in the digestive tract, hepatopancreas, of 

both molluscs and crustaceans. Like for Cd, the digestive tract of these kind of seafood has to 

be removed prior to consumption, preferably immediately after catch, to prevent a migration of 

Pb from intestine into muscle tissue. 

 

3.3 Risk assessment of seafood consumption 

The use of risk assessment is achieving progressive importance and recognition as a 

scientifically based approach to food safety and quality standards. According to Wal &amp;amp; Pascal 

(2000), the term "risk" can be defined as the probability of an adverse effect on a given 

organism, population or environment, as a result of exposure to a hazard. On the other hand, 

benefit is something that promotes or enhances well-being in the live organisms. To perform a 

risk assessment of a population that is exposed to certain food contaminants is necessary to 

understand and characterize this hazard, i.e., to determine their toxicological properties and 

establish the relationship between dose and adverse effects manifested (Nasreddine &amp;amp; Parent- 

Massin, 2002). The process of risk assessment can be divided into four stages: 1 - hazard 

identification, 2 - hazard characterization, 3 - exposure assessment, and 4 - risk 

characterization. The latter contains all the information obtained in the first three steps, 

performing qualitative and quantitative toxicological properties of an agent and its harmful 

effects on individuals exposed (Kroes et al., 2002).  

Today is generally accepted that seafood is important in a healthy and balanced human diet 

(WHO, 2003b) principally by the positive effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. 

However, seafood products are also a source of persistent chemical contaminants that 

accumulate in the marine food chain. Therefore, an increase in fish consumption to achieve an 

adequate intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may also increase the intake of these 

contaminants. Because of this phenomenon, a quantitative assessment of the intake of 

nutrients and contaminants via seafood consumption - and to ensuing health risk - have to be 

carried out in order to have more detailed information about the contribution of the various 

species to nutrient/contaminant intake (Sioen et al., 2007). Actually, these nutritional-

toxicological conflict related to seafood consumption has already been discussed at the 

Commission of the Codex on Contaminants in Food (Commission of the Codex Alimentarius) 

and a FAO/WHO expert consultation on the risks and benefits of seafood consumption was 

schedule in 2010, showing the pertinence of this subject (Sioen et al., 2009). On the paper VI it 

is presented a mathematical-statistical framework for quantifying the probabilities of risk 

associated with seafood consumption. In addition, the estimation of the intake of MeHg is done 

through the cephalopod species as well as through their consumption in Portugal, and thus, the 

estimation of the portion of a given population at risk (probability of exceeding MeHg PTWI) is 

also performed.

Three of the studies included in this work were designed to characterize some seafood, not so 

well studied in Portugal, in what concerns proximate and elemental composition as well as to 

provide knowledge of their contribution to dietary reference intake (DRI) or tolerable upper 

intake level (UL) (I-III). 

 

Elements, as Cd, Pb and Hg, considered non essential and harmful to humans were also 

quantified in the same seafood species and some deep water fish species (I-III, V). The relation 

of Se/Hg and correlations between elements and biological parameters were also studied (I-II, 

IV-V). The risk assessment, in terms of MeHg, in the cephalopods consumed in Portugal, was 

also analysed (VI). 

 

In addition, three other papers deal with the As contents in some seafood consumed in Portugal 

(VII), toxic elements in bivalve molluscs (VIII) and the influence of canning in the concentration 

of toxic elements (IX).

5 MATERIAL AND METHODS 

5.1 Biological material 

All fishery products used in this study were purchased directly from outlets in the Lisbon area 

or in several commercial farms located in Portugal, obtained from cruise ships organized by the 

Instituto Nacional de Recursos Biológicos (INRB, IP / L-IPIMAR) under the project "Programa 

Nacional de Amostragem Biológica / Recolha de Dados" (PNAB/EU Regulation) and collected 

at various production areas localised along the Portuguese coastal zone and estuaries, without 

a periodicity established, between 2000 and 2007. 

As sampling plays an important role in obtaining representative results, it was tried, whenever 

possible, to obey the Commission Directive 2001/22/EC of 8 March 2001 (EU, 2001) and more 

recently the Commission Directive 2005/4/EC of 19 January 2005 amending Directive 

2001/22/EC (EU, 2005) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 333/2007 of 28 March 2007 (EU, 

2007), laying down the sampling methods and the methods of analysis for the official control of 

the levels of Pb, Cd, Hg and 3-MCPD in foodstuffs. 

Studied samples were several species of fish, including farmed ones, three cephalopods, 

several bivalve molluscs and one crustacean. Canned seafood was also studied. The common 

name, scientific name and the number of analysed samples are described in Table 5.1. The 

morphology, habitat and fishing mode are described in detail in Annex A of this thesis (Data 

collected from the databases, "FishBase", "CephBase" and also Sanchez (1992)). Seafood 

products studied were selected taking into account the higher consumption in our country and 

the fact that some of these species have been little studied in Portugal.

All fishery products were transported from the place of purchase to the laboratory refrigerated 

or already frozen. Upon arrival at the laboratory, all specimens were weighed and measured 

according to its type and to the criteria described by Sanchez (1992). Within each species, it 

was analyzed the edible part of several specimens, individually whenever possible. Once 

homogenized, samples were placed in plastic bags, previously coded and frozen at -30 ° C until 

further analysis. Time is a factor that does not change the mineral composition, as they do not 

volatilize at room temperature or to usual temperatures in frozen storage (Nunes, personal 

presentation). 

The laboratory equipment used in the analysis was washed and/or decontaminated (HNO3 

20%, v/v), taking into account the analysis to be undertaken and to avoid any contamination. 

The mill granulator (Retsch GM 200) used in the homogenization of the samples had a layer of 

titanium. 

 

5.2 Methodologies 

The techniques used at Unit "Valorização dos Produtos da Pesca e Aquicultura" (U-VPPA) of 

INRB, I.P./L-IPIMAR, are validated in accordance with the Guide RELACRE 2000 (RELACRE, 

2000) and IPAC (Portuguese Institute for Accreditation) Guides including the Guidelines for 

Accreditation of Laboratories for Chemistry (2001, 2005). The chemical  laboratory of the Unit 

U-VPPA, which hosted the techniques used is accredited by IPAC (2010) for determining 

moisture, mineral, fat, total Hg, Cd and Pb. The technique for determining the elements for 

EDFRX was validated by the laboratory of the Atomic Physics Centre (Experimental Atomic 

Physics Section) of Science College of Lisbon University (FCUL). 

 

5.2.1 Proximate composition

Sample digestion with sulphuric acid in the presence of a catalyst. Alkalinisation of the extract 

with excess sodium hydroxide. Steam distillation to release ammonia and receipt in a boric acid 

solution followed by titration with a hydrochloric acid solution. The total nitrogen content is 

calculated based on the quantity of ammonia produced. The crude protein content is calculated 

by multiplying the result by a conventional conversion factor of 6.25. 

Weigh 0.5 to 1 g of homogenized sample with the accuracy of ± 0.001 g (balance Mettler 

Toledo, AG 204) to a filter paper for a Kjeldahl tube. Add a pellet catalyst (Kjeltab S/3,5) and 20 

ml of concentrated sulphuric acid (Merck, 95-97 %, m/m). Place in the apparatus of digestion 

(Tecator, Digestion System 20 - 1015 Digester) and digest about 1 hour (310 ° C for 10 minutes 

and subsequently at 450 º C for 50 minutes). Cool the tubes and proceeded to the distillation of 

ammonia, according to the instructions of the distillation apparatus (Tecator, Kjeltec Auto - 1035 

Analyser). The sample extract is alkalinized with excess sodium hydroxide solution (Merck, 40 

% m/v), followed by steam distillation to release ammonia and receipt in a boric acid solution 

(Merck, 1 % m/v with indicator: mixture of methyl red and bromocresol green) and finally is 

titrate with a hydrochloric acid solution (Merck titrisol, 0.1 N). A blank test is perform, following 

the procedure described above, employing the same quantities of all reagents used, except the

round-bottom flask, previously dried in an oven for 30 minutes, cooled in desiccators and 

weighed, and put also solvent into extractor enough to cover the cartridge. Put the flask with the 

extractor in the heating battery (SBS, PC 6L) for 7 hours. After extraction, remove the flask and 

eliminate the solvent by using a hot plate (Schott-Geräte, CK 111) about 35 ° C. Dry the flask 

containing the extract in an oven (Memmert, ULE 500) for 30 minutes and, after cooling in 

desiccators, weigh the flask. Repeat these two last operations until constant weight.

5.2.2 ????-Tocopherol 

The content of ?-tocopherol was determined by the method described by Piironen et al. 

(1984). 

Extraction of fat from homogenized samples. Dissolution of the oil obtained in n-hexane 

followed by injection in High Pressure Liquid Chromatograph (HPLC). 

The extraction of fat is based on the method described by Bligh &amp;amp; Dyer (1959). Solutions of 

methanol / chloroform (2:1) (99.8 %, m/m, Merck), saturated sodium chloride (99.5 % m/m, 

Merck) and Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT - 99 % m/m, AnalytiCals) solution (50 g/l) with 

chloroform (99.8 %, m/m Merck) have to be cooled at 5 º C before use. Weigh about 12.5 grams 

(balance Mettler Toledo, AG 204) of the sample into a tube and added 37.5 ml of methanol / 

chloroform solution and stirred between two-seven minutes in the Ultra-Turrax (IKA, T25). After, 

add five ml of saturated sodium chloride solution and homogenized seven minutes in the Ultra-

Turrax. Add 12.5 ml of chloroform with BHT and shake for 30 seconds to five minutes on the 

Ultra-Turrax. Then, add 12.5 ml of cold ultrapure water and homogenized 30 seconds to five 

minutes on the Ultra-Turrax. Put the sample in the ultrasonic bath (Sonorex, DK255P) for 10 

minutes. Filter for a Kitasato, using a Buchner funnel. Transfer the filtrate to a separating funnel. 

Collect the organic phase (bottom) filtering with a filter paper over sodium sulphate anhydrous 

for pear-shaped flask previously weighed. Evaporate the chloroform in rotary evaporator (Büchi, 

RE 121) (bath at 40 ° C, 291 mbar.) Weigh the pear-shaped flasks. Collect a known amount of 

oil in a known volume of solution of BHT (50 mg/l) in n-hexane (? 98 %, m/m, Merck). Transfer 

the mixture (oil / BHT in n-hexane) to vials for injection. When necessary to concentrate the 

sample, evaporate the solvent with the help of an evaporator of samples (Reacti, Therm III) with 

a stream of nitrogen). Add 100-200 µl n-hexane and transferred to vials for injection with 

"insert". 

For chromatographic analysis, inject 20 µl of the mixture into the HPLC system (Jasco, PU-

980). Selected the wavelengths, excitation 292 nm and emission, 324 nm. Use as mobile phase 

a mixture of n-hexano/2-propanol (? 99.9 %, m/m, Merck) to 0.7% with a flow rate of 0.5 

ml/minute.  

Draw two calibration curves from the readings obtained for solutions 1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 15 and 20 

and 8, 20, 40, 50, 100 and 200 µ of ?-tocopherol (95 % m/m, Sigma) using as solvent n-hexane. 

The ?-tocopherol is identified by comparison with retention times of standards. The peaks are 

integrated using software Borwin in version 1.2. The calculation of ?-tocopherol content, 

expressed in mg/100 g, is given by the relationship:

5.2.3 Elemental composition 

Techniques of Ultraviolet-Visible absorption spectrometry (UV-Vis), Atomic Absorption 

Spectrometry (AAS) and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence (EDXRF) to analyse chemical 

elements were used. These techniques were chosen for being the most suitable for the 

elements studied in this work, and also because they are available in the laboratories where the 

experimental part of this thesis were done. Some operating conditions for all elements analysed 

by these techniques are shown in Table 5.2 at the subchapter 5.2.3.6. 

All reagents used had a high purity and ultrapure water was used (obtained by the system 

Milli-Q Plus Millipore).  

 

5.2.3.1 Quantification of K, Na, Mg, Ca, Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn, Cr, Ni, Cd and Pb by flame 

atomic absorption spectrometry 

The levels of K, Na, Mg, Ca, Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn, Cr, Ni, Cd and Pb were determined by flame 

atomic absorption spectrofotometry (FAAS), based on the methodology proposed by Jorhem 

(2000) and technical procedures in use in the Unit U-VPPA of INRB, IP / L-IPIMAR.  

Incineration of the sample followed by dissolution in nitric acid. After dilution of the sample 

proceed to read the content of the element to be determined (K, Na, Mg, Ca, Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn, 

Cr, Ni, Cd and Pb) by flame atomic absorption. 

First, it is necessary to obtain the ash of the sample. For that, weigh 5 g or 10 g of 

homogenized sample (5 g for K, Na, Mg, Ca, Zn, Fe, Cu and Mn and 10 g for Cr, NI, Cd and 

Pb) with the accuracy of ± 0.001 g (balance Mettler Toledo, AG 204) to quartz crucible. Put the 

crucible for drying the sample in the oven (Cassel) to at least 100°C overnight. Then, transfer 

the crucible to the muffle furnace (Heraeus, MR 170E), raising the temperature very slowly, until 

500 ± 25 ºC. Let stand for 16 hours (overnight) for incineration. Remove the crucible from the 

muffle furnace and cool in desiccators. Then moisten the ash with nitric acid (65 % m/m, Merck) 

and evaporate carefully to dryness on a hot plate (Schott-Geräte, CK 111). The crucible is taken 

back to the oven at ± 400 °C for 20-30 minutes to obtain white ash.  

In the case of K, Na, Mg, Ca, Zn, Fe, Cu and Mn add 6 ml of nitric acid 15% (v/v) hot to 

dissolve the ash and then transfer and filter (Macherey-Nagel 640 w, ? = 7 cm) to a 25 ml 

volumetric flask. Wash the crucible with 6 ml of the same acid and then with ultrapure water. 

Both washing solutions pass through the filter. Cool and volume with ultrapure water. In the 

case of Cr, Ni, Cd and Pb add 3 ml of 15% nitric acid to dissolve the hot ash and then transfer 

and filter to a 10 ml volumetric flask. The crucible was washed with 2 ml of the same acid and 

then with ultrapure water. Both washing solutions pass through the filter. Cool and volume with 

ultrapure water. 

Read at the absorption wavelength corresponding to each element and record the maximum 

absorption signal obtained in the atomic absorption apparatus (Varian, Spectr AA 20). 

For the blank, put equal volume of nitric acid to 15% without sample in the adequate 

volumetric flask and make up the final volume with ultrapure water. 



Material and Methods 

 

39 

To set up the calibration curve, prepare 100 ml of a standard concentration of 10 µg/ml from 

the standard solution (1000 mg/L, Merck) for each element, using nitric acid as solvent, 5% 

(v/v). From the solution of 10 µg/ml, also called the intermediate solution, prepare five standard 

solutions to use in the calibration curve (calibration solutions). Plot a calibration curve from the 

readings obtained for these solutions. 

The calculation of the content of elements in mg/kg, wet weight is given by: 

m

VA )( ×
 

Where: 

A - reading in µg/ml; 

m - mass in grams, of the test sample; 

V - volume of the dissolution of the sample. 

The result is given by the arithmetic mean of at least two parallel determinations. 

 

5.2.3.2 Quantification of Cl, S, Br, Sr, Rb, Se and As by energy dispersive X-ray 

fluorescence 

The content of various elements was determined by EDFRX, based on methodology 

described by Carvalho et al. (2005) and Custódio et al. (2005), in the laboratory of the Atomic 

Physics Centre of FCUL.  

Use of a X radiation source to ionize internal levels of constituent atoms of the sample. In the 

reorganization of the atom and return to the ground state, these atoms can release the excess 

energy through the emission of a photon X, of energy equal to the difference in binding energy 

levels between which the transition occurred. This radiation is characteristic of the element. The 

detection and analysis of this spectrum allows the identification and quantification of 

constituents of the sample. 

First, it is necessary to obtain the freeze-dried sample. For this, a portion of the frozen sample 

is distributed evenly in a Petri dish. It is placed on the freeze-dryer (Edwards, Modulyo Freeze-

Dryer) for 48 hours (at a temperature of - 45 °C and a pressure of about 10
-1

 atmospheres). 

After, homogenize the freeze-dried samples and again placed in plastic bags properly identified 

(species, number), vacuum packed and stored at - 20 ° C until further analysis. 

Put the freeze-dried sample (a coffee spoon) in a cylinder and compress it into a press 

(Graseby, Speac) at a pressure of 10 Torr, forming a circular tablet of about 2 cm in diameter 

and 1mm thick. Glue the tablet to the Mylar film of the slide (50x50 mm). The choice of these 

materials is due to the fact that they have low atomic number and its characteristic radiation was 

not detected. Put the slide containing the sample tablet on a stand and link the equipment. This 

consists of a PW 1140 X-ray tube (100kV, 80mA; Phillips, Eindhoven) equipped with a 

changeable molybdenum secondary target and Si(Li) detector (Oxford, High Wycombe). The 

energy resolution is 135 eV at 5.9 keV and the acquisition system is a Nuclear PCA card 

(Oxford, High Wycombe). Expose each tablet to radiation during 1000 seconds. The spectrum 

is obtained by the Quantum MCA software. 



Material and Methods 

 

40 

From the spectra (energy versus intensity) determine the energy corresponding to each 

observed peak. Identify the existing elements in the sample by comparing these energies with 

the theoretical energies corresponding to different elements (Table of X-ray emission energies). 

After calculating the intensity of each radiation, the concentration of the detected elements is 

determined by the expression: 

iiii
mCcKII

0
=  

Where: 

Ii - X radiation intensity, characteristic of the element i; 

I0 - incident radiation intensity; 

Ki - experimental calibration factor; 

ci - concentration of element i; 

m - sample surface mass (g/cm
2
); 

Ci - damping factor. 

 

The quantification is done by the software "XRF - Quantitative Calculation (fundamental 

parameters)" for Windows. The result of the content of each analyzed element, expressed in mg 

/kg wet weight, is calculated taking into account its content in mg/kg dry weight (given by the 

software) and moisture of each sample. 

The result is given by the arithmetic mean of at least two parallel determinations. 

 

5.2.3.3 Quantification of P by Ultraviolet-Visible absorption spectrometry 

The content of P was determined by UV/Vis, based on methodology described in ISO 13730 

(1996). 

All equipment and utensils used in this technique should be free of residues of detergent 

containing phosphates. Materials have to decontaminate in a solution of 25% hydrochloric acid 

for 24 hours. 

Drying the sample and the incineration of residue (500 ± 25 °C). Acid hydrolysis of the ashes 

with nitric acid, filtration and dilution, followed by formation of a yellow compound after the 

addition of a mixture of ammonium monovanadate and ammonium heptamolybdate. 

Spectrophotometric measurement at 430 nm. 

In this case it is necessary to have the ash of sample. For that, weigh 5 g of homogenized 

sample with the accuracy of ± 0.001 g (balance Mettler Toledo, AG 204) to crucible, previously 

decontaminated. Put the crucible for drying the sample in the oven (Cassel) at least 100°C 

overnight. Then, transfer the crucible to the muffle furnace (Heraeus, MR 170E), raising the 

temperature very slowly, until 500 ± 25 ºC. Let stand for 16 hours (overnight) for incineration. 

Remove the crucible from the muffle furnace and cool in desiccators.  

Reconstitute the ash obtained with 10 ml of HNO3 (65 % 1 + 2 ultrapure water , v/v). Cover 

the crucible with a watch glass, put it on the hot plate (Schott-Geräte, CK 111), boil about 8 

minutes. Cool and transfer to volumetric flask of 100 ml. Dilute with ultrapure water, mix and 

filter (Macherey-Nagel, GF-1, ? = 10 cm). Pipette a volume V of filtrate (not exceeding 20 ml) 



Material and Methods 

 

41 

for a volumetric flask of 100 ml, add 30 ml of colorimetric reagent (mix 1 volume of nitric acid 

solution with a volume of solution of ammonium monovanadate (2.5 g/L) and mix. Then add a 

volume of solution of ammonium heptamolybdate (50 g/L) and mix. The colorimetric reagent 

should be pale yellow and completely clear) make up the volume with ultrapure water and let 

stand at least 15 min at room temperature. Measure the absorbance of this solution at 430 nm 

(quartz cells of 1 cm optical path) in the spectrophotometer (UNICAM UV/Vis UV2) and 

corrected with a blank.  

For the blank, measure 2 ml of nitric acid solution and 30 ml of colorimetric reagent to a 

volumetric flask of 100 ml, dilute to volume with ultrapure water and mix. 

To set up the calibration curve, measure 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 ml of standard phosphate solution 

(1000 mg/L, Merck) for volumetric flasks of 100 ml. Add 10 ml of nitric acid solution, dilute to 

volume with ultrapure water and mix. Next, measure 20 ml of each of these standard solutions 

of phosphate to 100 ml volumetric flasks, add 30 ml of colorimetric reagent (described above) 

make up the volume with ultrapure water and let stand at least 15 min at room temperature. 

These standard solutions are respectively the concentrations of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 µg of 

P2O5/ml. Measure the absorbance of these solutions in the spectrophotometer at 430 nm, 

corrected with the blank. Establish the calibration curve marking the values of absorbance 

measurements. 

The calculation of phosphorus content, expressed as grams of phosphorus pentoxide per 

kilogram of wet weight sample is given by: 

V x m

C x 10
 

where: 

C = concentration of sample solution obtained from the calibration curve in µg/ml of P2O5; 

m = mass of test portion in grams;  

V = volume of filtrate used in the colorimetric determination in ml. 

 

The result is given by the arithmetic mean of at least two parallel determinations. 

 

5.2.3.4 Quantification of total mercury by cold vapour atomic absorption spectrometry 

Total mercury (HgT) was determined by cold vapour atomic absorption spectroscopy (CVAAS) 

according to the method developed by Hatch &amp;amp; Ott (1968) and described by Joiris et al. (1991). 

Digestion of the sample with sulphuric acid. Oxidation of Hg to mercuric ion with potassium 

permanganate in acid medium. Reduction of mercuric ion to elemental form with tin chloride. 

The vaporized Hg is put into circulation in the cell absorption spectrophotometer using a bubbler 

system. The readings are made at the absorption wavelength of 253.7 nm. 

Weigh approximately 1 g of homogenized sample with accuracy of 0.001 g (balance Mettler 

Toledo, AG 204) to Erlenmeyer flasks of 150 ml. Add 20 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid (95-

97 %, Merck) carefully and shaking slightly. Then place the Erlenmeyer flasks in an oven 

(Durocell, Model 55) set at 60 ± 2 º C for 6 hours. After cooling, place the Erlenmeyer flasks in a 



Material and Methods 

 

42 

tank with water, cooled with ice, and add about 25 ml (or more if necessary) of a solution of 

potassium permanganate (5 % m/v, Merck) to provide persistent purple colour. After a period 3-

4 hours, transfer carefully to a 300 ml flask already containing 30 ml of distilled water. Add 

washings of Erlenmeyer flasks of 150 ml, until a total volume of 100 ml. After, add 5 ml of a 

solution of hydroxylamine hydrochloride (1.5 % m/v, Merck). After decolourization of the sample, 

add 2-3 ml of a solution of tin chloride (II) (20 % m/v in hydrochloric acid 20 % (v/v) Merck) and 

introduce the bubbler of the spectrometer (Bacharach, Coleman MAS 50D) into to the flask of 

300 ml, quickly adjusting to the whole system and without leaks. Finally, there is the maximum 

absorption obtained by the equipment at 253.7 nm. 

The blank is carried out on 100 ml of distilled water by adding a few drops of potassium 

permanganate, and proceeding in an identical manner as for a sample. 

For the calibration curve, prepare intermediate Hg solutions of 10 µg/ml and 0.1 µg/ml in 0.5 

M HNO3, using the standard solution 1000 ug/ml (Merck). Draw two calibration curves obtained 

from the readings of 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.8 and 1.0 ml and 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and 5, 0 ml, prepared 

from standard solution of 0.1 µg/ml, corresponding values of 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.08 and 0.1 g/ml 

(low range) and 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 g/ml (high range), respectively. The quantification is 

done by the software "MercuReport II”, versão 1.00, XRF, 1994, Bacharach, Inc., USA, for 

Windows. 

The calculation of the HgT content in mg/kg, wet weight is given by:

Where: 

A - reading in µg; 

m - mass in grams, of the test sample. 

 

The result is given by the arithmetic mean of at least two parallel determinations. 

 

5.2.3.5 Quantification of organic mercury by atomic absorption spectrometry 

The determination of organic mercury (HgOrg) was based on the method described by Scerbo 

&amp;amp; Barghigiani (1998). 

Hydrolysis of the freeze-dried sample with hydrobromic acid followed by extraction of organic 

compounds with toluene. Removal of organic compounds of Hg using a solution of cysteine. 

Thermal and chemical decomposition of the sample (cysteine containing organic compounds of 

Hg) in the oven of the Hg analyser. Selective retention of Hg in an amalgam of gold then 

release after heating. Trawling of Hg vapour by oxygen through cell absorption 

spectrophotometer. Reading the absorption at a wavelength of 253.7 nm. 

First, it is necessary to obtain the freeze-dried sample. For this, a portion of the frozen sample 

is distributed evenly in a Petri dish. It is placed on the freeze-dryer (Edwards, Modulyo Freeze-

Dryer) for 48 hours (at a temperature of - 45 °C and a pressure of about 10
-1

 atmospheres). 



Material and Methods 

 

43 

After, homogenize the freeze-dried samples and again placed in plastic bags properly identified 

(species, number), vacuum packed and stored at - 20 ° C until further analysis. 

Weigh about 200 mg of freeze-dried sample (balance Mettler Toledo, AG 204) to a centrifuge 

tube (FEP with screw cap of ETFE, Nalgene). Add 10 ml of hydrobromic acid (47 % m/m, 

Merck) and 20 ml of toluene (? 99 % m/m, Merck). Stir the mixture in a vortex (Heidolph, ReAX) 

for about 5 minutes and centrifuge (Sigma, 3K29) for 20 minutes at 3000 rpm. Remove 15 ml of 

organic phase and placed into another tube which was previously added 6 ml of cysteine 

solution (1 % L-cysteine hydrochloride, monohydrate in 12.5 % of sodium sulphate and 0.8 % of 

sodium acetate, all Merck). Add 15 ml of toluene to the tube containing the initial hydrobromic 

acid and repeat the process. Finally, shake (manually and vortex) the tube containing the 

solution of cysteine and toluene (30 ml) and centrifuge for 20 minutes at 3000 rpm. Transfer to 

another centrifuge tube 3 ml of cysteine for subsequent analysis. From this solution withdraw 

between 100 a 500 µl in a small boat. Put the small boat on Hg analyzer and read according to 

the instructions of the Hg analyser (LECO, AMA 254). The blank is carried out as described 

above except the step of weighing the sample that were not made. It is accepted the calibration 

curve introduced into the Hg analyzer software (0.10, 0.30, 1.00, 3.00, 10.00, 20.00, 30.00, 

36.00 ng of Hg). To verify the calibration curve prepare one intermediate Hg solution of 10 µg/ml 

in 1% of HNO3, using the standard solution 1000 mg/L (Merck). After, prepare two standard 

solutions  of  0.1 µg/ml  and  0.005 µg/ml  to  read in the mercury analyser. 

The calculation of HgOrg level, expressed as a percentage, is given by the relationship:

5.2.4 - Handling of the data 

5.2.4.1 Risk analysis 

Toxic metals’ risks to human health are assessed by comparing the weekly intake level with 

an appropriate safe exposure level, the PTWI for each toxic metal (Renwick et al. 2003). That 

is, assessing the probability of the intake level exceeding the respective PTWI value. There are 

two alternatives for estimating the risk; the plug-in (PI) and the tail estimation (TE) based 

estimators (Tressou et al. 2004). Both were used, the PI estimator for large probabilities and the 

TE estimator for the other situations (especially, for very low probabilities). The statistical 

methodology based on the extreme value theory (which has found application in various 

scientific fields, such as hydrology) was applied to the MeHg data of cephalopod species. This 

analysis is described in detail in the Paper VI and also in Cardoso et al. (2010b). 

 

5.2.4.2 Statistical Analysis 

The statistical treatment of the data was performed using the STATISTICA 6.1 software (Stat 

soft, Inc., Tulsa, OK74104, USA). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov or Lilliefors-test and the Levene´s 

test were used to check the normality and the homogeneity of variance of data, respectively 

(Zar, 1999). Data that corroborate these assumptions were analysed by Student t-test or single 

factor ANOVA analysis to evaluate the influence of some factors like sex or age groups on the 

concentrations of various elements, for each species. Comparisons were made using Kruskall-

Wallis test when the conditions were nonparametric. In some cases data logarithmic 

transformation was applied to reduce the wide range of values. The Pearson correlation 

between elements of each species was determined. The significance level for statistical 

analyses was always tested at ? = 0.05 (p &amp;lt;0.05). These analyses are described in detail in 

Papers I, II, III, IV, V and VII.

6 FINAL DISCUSSION 

In this chapter it is intended to summarize the main results obtained on the selected species, 

which are versed in the nine papers incorporated in this thesis. 

 

6.1 Cephalopods 

Cephalopods are part of the traditional diet of coastal communities in southern European 

countries. In Portugal, they are important targeted species in fisheries, specially octopus, that 

has a high economic, social and culture value. The results obtained for proximate composition 

showed that they are a good source of protein (levels around 19%) and have an appreciable 

mineral content (about 2%). The fat level was very low (&lt;1%) and consequently they can be 

considered lean species. These results are similar to those observed by other authors (Favier et 

al. 1995; Bandarra et al., 2005). From paper I, it can be concluded that they are a good source 

of essential elements (mainly S, P, Zn and Cu) and, in general, their contents are in the same 

order of magnitude as those reported by other authors (Table 6.1). However, in the case of Zn, 

Fe and Cu, values may be different due to different sizes of the specimens and also due to 

different testing methodologies. Most part of the elements can be assumed to be incorporated 

by the diet because cephalopods are know to be carnivorous, active predators and have very 

high feeding rates (Villanueva &amp;amp; Bustamante, 2006). This may explain the high values of almost 

essential elements, particularly in the case of the octopus. Octopuses usually consume 

crustaceans (Smith, 2003), like crabs, that contain high levels of these elements. However, 

absorption also takes place from seawater. Until know, no data on the respective proportions of 

the elements incorporated from food and seawater has been published for cephalopods. 

Nevertheless, a similar behaviour to that of fish is expected to have place in cephalopods. 

Among the three cephalopods, squid shows the lowest concentrations of most essential 

elements. According to some authors (Guerra &amp;amp; Rocha, 1994; Coelho et al., 1997) fish is 

always the main component of the squid diet, representing about 90 % of the prey found in their 

stomachs. This may explain the low values of essential elements in this species, since fish 

contains fewer minerals than crustaceans, preferred prey of the octopus. Unlike fish, K in 

cephalopods is low, and in the case of the octopus, is below the level of Na. In general, Na 

contents are considerably higher in shellfish than in finfish (Vlieg et al., 1991). Thus, the ratio 

Na/K in octopus is high (2.6), which can be seen as an increased risk of developing 

cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure (Astorga España et al., 2007). 

Although the levels of essential elements are lower in squid, the three studied species can 

have a good contribution to the DRI of these elements, especially with regard to the Cu, S, P, 

Cl, Zn and Mg (Table 6.2), considering the DRI for adults. 

Taking into consideration the limits set by EU (2006, 2008) for Hg, Pb and Cd, the mean 

levels detected of these toxic elements in cephalopods were always lower, although some 

specimens of octopus and cuttlefish (about 10 %) has shown high levels of Cd. This occurs very 

often in cephalopods, since these animals have the ability to concentrate Cd in the

in mantle and arms, in addition to digestive gland (Bustamante et al., 1998; Miramand &amp;amp; 

Bentley, 1992). The levels of these metals in squid samples, especially Cd, were always very 

low. This different behaviour is probably due to their diet and also to the different habitat. Mean 

values of As presented similar pattern: octopus showed the highest values and squid showed 

the lowest ones (VII), possibly due to the same facts. Taking into account the different PTWIs, 

the consumption of cephalopods does not pose a hazard to human diet, albeit moderation is 

recommended in the case of cuttlefish and octopus (Table 6.3) for which four or five meals per 

week should not be achieved taking into consideration the HgOrg levels. 

The results allow to draw a general recommendation for the consumption of these species 

(Fig. 6.1). 

 

6.2 Crustacean 

Crustaceans have been lauded for their health promoting characteristics. Norway lobster had 

a low fat and high protein and mineral contents, with a low energy value. These characteristics 

make this species interesting from a nutritional standpoint. Generally, other crustaceans, as 

blue crab and Atlantic spider crab, showed a similar proximate composition (Gökoðlu &amp;amp; 

Yerlikaya, 2003; Küçükgülmez et al., 2006; Marques et al., 2010). They are nutritional valuable 

sources of various minerals (Küçükgülmez et al., 2006) as can be seen in Table 6.4. Related 

publications on these elements concentrations in similar crustacean species also reveal high 

values  of essential  elements, however  there are  some  differences. Due to Ca  metabolism in

crustaceans being much more active than other invertebrates (due to the moult) the levels of 

this metal are considerably high. The skeleton needs to shed regularly to allow increase in body 

size (Greenaway, 1985). High levels of Cu, Fe and Zn are also found in this species (however 

lower than the levels referred for other species). This is probably due to the fact that Norway 

lobster is a species that feeds on benthic sediments that are generally rich in trace elements. 

High levels of Cu are probably due to the requirement of this element by the respiratory pigment

Life Information Network (a,b); Cefalópodos; As receitas da Amélie) 

 

haemocyanin in crustaceans. According to the levels of essential elements found, this 

crustacean is a good contribution for the DRI of most essential elements (Table 6.2). However, 

the level of Cu greatly exceeds the DRI. Nevertheless, there is no problem in relation to 

consumption of this species because the estimated UL for Cu (IOM, 2005) is 10mg/day and the 

calculated value in this thesis is 1.7 mg/day (a meal of 160 g). 

Regarding toxic elements (II), Norway lobster showed low mean values of Pb and Cd, inferior 

to EU limits (EU, 2006, 2008), being the estimated weekly intake, based on a 160 g portion per 

day and a person of 60 kg BW, also lower than the respectively PTWI (Table 6.3). 

Nevertheless, this species presented high levels of Hg (total and organic - about 78 % of total) 

and As (II, VII). These contents of Hg and As can be attributed to its habitat. In fact, this species 

usually lives in muddy sediments that always contain high levels of these elements and 

furthermore this species is considered a scavenger (Barghigiani et al., 2000). In this case, EDI 

of HgT and HgOrg exceeded the PTWI.

Final Discussion

Having regard to the percentage value obtained for the HgOrg, consumption do not have to 

exceed a meal of Norway lobster per week. In spite of high levels of As, several authors 

(Ackley, et al., 1999; Muñoz et al., 2000; Cava-Montesinos et al., 2005) and also FDA (1993c) 

reported that most of the As compounds found in seafood are methylated, and therefore are 

relatively low in toxicity and do not present a concern to the consumer. In Figure 6.2 it can be 

observed a draw of general recommendations for the consumption of this crustacean.

6.3 Farmed fish 

Actually, farmed fish offers an alternative solution to the increasing market demand for fish 

and fish protein. The results obtained in this thesis confirmed this statement. They have a 

protein content of about 20 %, which is considered a good value for fishery products (Belitz, 

2004). Fat levels where different among the four studied species ranging between 4 and 12 % 

(trout and European seabass, respectively). These dissimilar values are attributed to the 

different farm systems and feeds composition. They have a similar mineral content to those 

obtained  in  other  studies  performed  in  the  same  species  (Table 6.5). The  profile  of  main

Final Discussion

elements was analogous for all the species (III): K&gt;P&gt;Na&gt;Mg&gt;Ca, showing a low Na/K (? 0.3). 

The profile of trace and ultrace elements was somewhat different, mainly in what regards Cu, Cr 

and Mn. Turbot was the species that revealed the lowest mineral content. The apparent reason 

for this difference seems to be the diet. Some species contributed to more than 50 % for P, 19% 

for Mg and 17 % for K DRIs (European seabass and trout) (Table 6.2). Chromium percentages 

of farmed fish are above the DRI (more than 100 %). However, according to the Council for 

responsible Nutrition (CRN) (Hathcock, 2004), Cr supplements at levels up to 1,000 µg per day 

are regarded as safe for adults. Such limit is above the results found in this study (maximum: 

0.05 mg Cr in a portion of 160 g). Considering the contaminant elements (As, Cd, Hg and Pb), 

farmed fish showed low values (III, VII). Thus, estimated weekly intakes were consistently lower 

than the PTWI set by WHO/FAO (WHO, 1999, 2003a), except for HgOrg (only analyzed in 

samples  of gilthead seabream). However, there seems to be no problem because it is possible 

to get six meals without reaching the PTWI, which is unlikely to accomplish. A general draw of 

consumption recommendation can be seen in Figure 6.3.

6.4 Deep-water fish 

Deep-water fish species are generally predators with a long life span that tend to make them 

accumulate more toxic metals, especially Hg, than other marine species. Blackbelly rosefish 

and black scabbardfish studied in this thesis (IV-V) showed high levels of HgT. Comparing the 

observed values with those of other authors (Table 6.6) it is verified that, in general, the levels 

of HgT are similar for black scabbardfish although the geographic area is different. With regard 

to blackbelly rosefish, values obtained in this study were higher than those recorded in studies 

conducted by Monteiro et al. (1991) and Andersen &amp;amp; Depledge (1997). This finding may be due 

to the fact that the specimens studied are larger than those in the two other studies. Organic 

mercury levels were about 86 % of the HgT for both species. Similar percentages for other 

deep-water fish species were obtained by others (Andersen &amp;amp; Depledge, 1997; Storelli et al., 

2003, 2005; Magalhães et al., 2007). Significant positive correlations between HgT and length 

were found, which is in agreement with the results presented by Monteiro et al. (1991), 

Andersen &amp;amp; Depledge (1997) and Bebiano et al. (2007). It is also noted that the levels of HgT 

observed for black scabbardfish caught off the Azores and Madeira were significantly higher 

than those caught off the mainland. This is mainly due to the fact, of Azores and Madeira being 

volcanic regions and for that a potential source of Hg. Given the high levels of Hg, the molar 

ratio of Se:Hg was determined and the values were superior to one. Such value indicated that 

the absorption of Hg can be counteract by Se. Similar ratios were reported (Andersen &amp;amp; 

Depledge, 1997; Plessi et al., 2001; Cabañero et al., 2004). According the limits fixed by EU 

(2006, 2008) for HgT (1.0 mg/kg for black scabbardfish and 0.50 mg/kg for blackbelly rosefish), 

it was found that some specimens showed concentrations above the limits (30 % and 70 %, 

respectively). Taking into consideration these results, estimated weekly intakes of HgT and 

HgOrg exceeded the PTWI (Table 6.3) and the consumption of the two species should not 

exceed one meal per week. On the other hand, mean levels of Cd and Pb in muscle 

sampleswere lower than the limits proposed by EU (2006, 2008) (data not showed for blackbelly 

rosefish). This pattern was also verified by other authors (Table 6.6). Total arsenic for both 

species were considered low when compared with other species (VII) and are in accordance 

with Mormede &amp;amp; Davies (2001). Thus, these latter three elements do not pose any problem to 

the consumption of these two species (Table 6.3). A draw of general recommendations for 

consumption of both species, is given in Figure 6.4. 

 

6.5 Bivalves 

Bivalves, as the other marine organisms, are a good source of nutrients. The consumption of 

some species provides a source of protein for human consumption (Astorga España et al., 

2007). But, on the other hand, they are filter or deposit feeders; therefore, they can absorb toxic 

elements not  only from food and water, but also from inorganic particulate materials they ingest 

(Özden et al., 2009). For that reason, many researchers have reported the potentiality of using 

bivalves as  bioindicators or  biomarkers for  monitoring  toxic metals  contaminations  in aquatic

system (Liang et al., 2004; Özden et al., 2009). The results obtained in this thesis (VIII) 

illustrated the contamination level of production areas localised along the Portuguese coastal 

zone and estuaries. Total Hg levels were always very low (below 0.1 mg/kg) being the highest 

values observed in bivalves from the Tagus estuary. However, the concentrations found are 

well below the limit proposed by the EU, 0.5 mg/kg (2006, 2008). Similar values were found in 

other papers (Table 6.7). Furthermore, bivalves do not normally contain high concentrations of 

Hg because they are low on the trophic chain and have a short life cycle (Gutiérrez et al., 

2006).The results also leads to the conclusion that the areas studied are not be sources of 

anthropogenic  Hg. The  same  can not  be  said  with  regard  to  Pb and  Cd. Some samples of

furrow shell of the Tagus estuary and some oysters of the Sado estuary showed very high 

levels of Pb and Cd,  respectively (above the  limits  set for these species). Like otherestuaries, 

Tagus and Sado ones, are most intensively used and one of the most  vulnerable coastal areas. 

They receive a multitude of inputs from point and diffusive sources (Blasco et al., 1999, França 

et al., 2005). Thus, these results indicate some pollution in these two estuaries, which is 

reflected in the bivalves living inside these areas. Furthermore, the furrow shell is considered a 

species that is a burrowing and a deposit-feeding bivalve, which may explain the high levels of 

Pb. Oysters are suspension feeders and can uptake metals from the re-suspended sediments, 

thus the high levels of Cd indicate that the sediments may contain high contents of this metal 

and, probably, the phytoplankton and zooplankton in the Sado estuary are also contaminated. 

The levels for both elements, reported by other authors for the same species, show great 

variability (Table 6.7). These dissimilarities indicate a different degrees of pollution in the 

different coastal and  estuarine areas of the World. However, this accumulation of metals is also

dependent of other factors such as the organism size and reproductive state (Usero et al., 

1997). 

From the food safety point of view, it is important to control the contribution of bivalve 

molluscs to the weekly Cd and Pb intakes (Table 6.3). The results obtained showed that only 

furrow shell and Portuguese oyster surpassed the PTWI indicated by FAO/WHO and, for that 

the consumption of these two species have to be moderated. Nevertheless, it is very 

uncommon in Portugal that a person have six or seven meals per week of these bivalve 

species. General recommendations for consumption of these species can be graphically 

observed in Figure 6.5.

6.6 Canned seafood 

Canned seafood still record a reasonable demand in several countries of the world including 

Portugal. Their consumption is somewhat privileged because of its convenient and affordable 

use for most working families. These products, generally reflect the profile of raw-material, and 

therefore may also contain toxic elements. However, it is noteworthy that the processing steps 

can alter the concentration of toxic metals in fish prior to consumption (Rasmussen et al., 2007;

Ganjavi et al., 2010). In general, Portuguese canned seafood studied in this thesis, did not show 

mean high levels of the three toxic metals (IX). Lead was only detected in about 20 % of 

analysed samples and the maximum concentration found did not reach the proposed limits for 

EU (2006, 2008). These results were in good agreement with several authors (Table 6.8).

Previous works showed high levels of Pb, likely by the use of Pb soldered side seam in cans. 

Actually, this is not the used procedure and consequently the levels have decreased. Canned 

molluscs, especially of squid, showed the highest levels of Cd. Papers published on levels of 

toxic metals in canned shellfish are scarce. However, there are few that also mention the high 

values of Cd, principally in canned squid (Table 6.8). These high values are attributed to the 

presence of visceral tissue in this kind of canned seafood (Galitsopoulou et al., 2009). Mercury 

levels were always very low and did not exceed the limits of 0.5 and 1.0 mg kg
-1

, according to 

the species (EU, 2006, 2008). The exception occurred in some samples (around 0.5 %) of 

canned tuna that reached the proposed limit. These high figures are mainly due to the feeding 

behaviour of tuna, since it is a very voracious and predatory species (Khansari et al., 2005; 

Storelli et al., 2010). Probably, these Hg contents are also increased by the canning process 

(Rasmussen et al., 2007) due to water release. There are several studies on Hg in canned tuna 

(Table 6.8). Overall, the Hg values vary somewhat, but are similar to those reported in this 

thesis. Differences are possibly due to different species of tuna, of different sizes and different 

capture sites, more or less polluted. According to the Table 6.3, only canned tuna slightly 

exceeded the estimated weekly intake for HgT, however the maximum number of meals 

allowed, six, seems unlikely in the Portuguese diet. Some consumption recommendations are 

generally described in Figure 6.6. 

 

6.7 Risk assessment of seafood consumption 

The simultaneous assessment of risks and benefits in seafood has been subject of various 

studies (Cohen et al., 2005; Domingo et al., 2007; van der Voet et al., 2007; Gladyshev et al., 

2009; Sioen et al., 2009). In this thesis, the hazard MeHg was chosen, since it is the component 

whose effects are most likely to contribute substantially to health impacts associated with 

seafood consumption. The results for the cephalopods group (VI) showed that squid presented 

the  lowest  risk, being  octopus´ risk  the  higest as a result of higher MeHg content and greater

consumption. Thus, whereas for squid no consumption restriction seems necessary, for 

cuttlefish and octopus an ideal maximal consumption of two meals per week must be advised. 

Other studies about risk assessment of methyl-Hg intake trough seafood were already done 

(Tressou et al., 2004; Cardoso et al., 2010a, 2010b). Regarding black scabbardfish, it was 

found  (Cardoso et al., 2010a) that  people  who consume  two or three  meals per week, have a 

high probability of being overly exposed to MeHg, about 1:55. This result confirms the data 

shown previously (Paper IV) that the black scabbardfish should be eaten sparingly. Another 

study (Cardoso et al., 2010b), conceptualized to compare the risks and benefits associated to 

the consumption of the five most consumed seafood species in Portugal (cod, hake, sardine, 

horse mackerel and tuna), indicated that tuna and hake yielded the maximum probability of 

exceeding the MeHg PTWI, but somehow they are still considered negligible. The results also 

show that probabilities of surpassing the MeHg PTWI were lower than those of exceeding the 

EPA + DHA recommended daily intake. However, high seafood consumptions per se, do not

indicate much on the relation between risks and benefits to which a given population is subject. 

This information needs to be supplemented with a thorough knowledge about the species which 

are consumed, the consumption frequency and the amounts, included in the diet of a 

population. 

 



Main Conclusions - Future Outlook

7 MAIN CONCLUSIONS - FUTURE OUTLOOK 

In this thesis it was studied the centesimal and elemental composition (essential and toxic 

elements) of several fishery and aquaculture products. It was also evaluated the MeHg risks 

associated with cephalopods consumption in Portugal. The results show that the studied 

species can give a relevant contribution to the DRI in an equilibrated diet and their consumption 

is considered healthy. However, some molluscs and deep-fish species have to be 

parsimoniously consumed due to the levels of toxic elements. It can also be state that MeHg 

risk assessment for Portuguese consumers reveals no danger concerning the observed squid 

consumption levels but octopus and cuttlefish consumption present a relatively high MeHg risk. 

Nevertheless, known the various assumptions used in this study, it can not be considered a 

public health problem. 

These results can be used to complete databases and to establish and revise limits to be 

included in standards or legislation. However, this is a job that requires constant updating due, 

not only to the variety of species that already exist, but also to the introduction of new species in 

the market, either wild or farmed. Thus, it would be desirable to study the small pelagic fish (eg 

chub mackerel and horse mackerel) and other deep-water fish species given the relatively high 

volume of catches in Portugal, and the high number of new imported species that start to be 

very important in the Portuguese market, mainly due to the low price (eg Nile perch - Lates 

niloticus or panga - Pangasius hypophthalmus). 

The risk analysis performed in this work is preliminary and need further support. For this, it will 

be necessary to gather consumption data, through surveys of consumption of selected fishery 

products. Relatively to contaminants, speciation analysis for As compounds is required to 

determine the toxic and non-toxic fractions in seafood since the toxicity of As is highly 

dependent on its chemical form, with inorganic As being the most toxic (Lin et al., 2008). It will 

also be crucial to quantify other chemical contaminants as organic polychlorinated 

dibenzodioxins (PCDD), dibenzofurans (PCDF) and PCBs in the fishery and aquaculture 

products in Portugal because such compounds persist and bioaccumulate through the food 

chain (Karouna-Renier et al., 2007). Moreover, although there are some models to assess the 

risk / benefit, eg QALIBRA Tool (QALIBRA, 2010), it would be interesting to look for new 

models. 

Another area of future research will be the assessment of contaminant compounds 

bioaccessibility from seafood to human consumers. In current human health risk assessment, 

the maximum acceptable concentrations of contaminants in food are mostly based on the total 

concentrations. However, the total concentration of contaminants may not always reflect the 

available amount (He et al., 2010). Bioaccessibility determination is thus required to improve the 

risk assessment of contaminants. These studies should be made not only in raw fishery 

products but also in cooked ones, since it is the latter form that they are consumed by humans.

Essential and contaminant elements concentrations were determined in the muscle tissue of octopus
(Octopus vulgaris), squid (Loligo vulgaris) and cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis), caught off the Portuguese coast
in 2004–2005. As expected, the largest concentrations found correspond to Cl, S, K, Na, P and Mg (average
values between 629 mg (100 g)?1, for Cl, and 435 mg kg?1, for Mg, in octopus and squid, respectively).
Above average concentrations of Zn, Cu, Fe and Sr were also found. The highest total Hg concentration
was found in cuttlefish (0.36 mg kg?1); however, this value did not exceed the recommended limit pro-
posed by EU (0.5 mg kg?1). Lead levels observed in all samples were always significantly lower than the
EU limit (1.0 mg kg?1). Regarding Cd, the 1.0 mg kg?1 limit was only exceeded in two octopus samples. It
may be concluded that the cephalopods studied do not constitute cause for concern, in terms of toxic ele-
ments, and could be safely used for daily intake of essential elements. Nevertheless, the squid contribu-
tion for elemental DI is minor in comparison to the other two species.

1. Introduction

Fish and shellfish are considered some of the most interesting
dietary products, and their nutritional benefits are well-known.
Seafood is rich in protein, with a balanced amino acid composition
and a high proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (Belitz,
Grosch, &amp;amp; Schieberle, 2004; Oehlenschläger, 1997). These species
also contain most of the 90 natural elements (Causeret, 1962; Lall,
1995). The largest concentrations correspond to carbon, hydrogen,
nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur (structural elements) followed by
chlorine, potassium, phosphorus, sodium, magnesium and calcium
(Lall, 1995; Oehlenschläger, 1997). Other elements are present at
lower levels, being described as trace or ultratrace elements. These
elements are classed as essential, when their biological roles are
well-known, such as occurs with iron, copper, zinc, iodine, manga-
nese, selenium or fluorine; non-essential, when their physiological
functions have not been clearly demonstrated, such as occurs with
nickel, vanadium and arsenic; and toxic, such as mercury, lead and
cadmium (Lall, 1995).

Cephalopods are an excellent source of some essential elements
(Oehlenschläger, 1997); however, given the morphological and
biological characteristics associated to their habitat, some contam-
ll rights reserved.

inant metals may accumulate in their tissues (Bustamante,
Caurant, Fowler, &amp;amp; Miramand, 1998; Bustamante, Grigioni,
Boucher-Rodoni, Caurant, &amp;amp; Miramand, 2000; Soldevilla, 1987).
Among seafood species, cephalopods represent one of the most
important groups captured in Europe (Fernández-Rueda &amp;amp; Gar-
cía-Flórez, 2007). In Portugal, cephalopods represented, in 2005,
only approximately 8% of wholesale market sales; however, the
corresponding values in terms of auction transaction were approx-
imately three times higher than those registered for fish species
(Fonseca, Campos, &amp;amp; Garcia, 2002).

Although, numerous studies on the elemental composition of
cephalopod species exist (Napoleão, Pinheiro, &amp;amp; Sousa Reis, 2005;
Raimundo, Caetano, &amp;amp; Vale, 2004; Seixas, Bustamante, &amp;amp; Pierce,
2005a, 2005b; Villanueva &amp;amp; Bustamante, 2006), their objectives
were mostly related to environmental contamination and its use
in biological monitoring. Most of these studies focus on amounts
present in several organs such as digestive glands, branchial hearts
and gills (Bustamante, Lahaye, Durnez, Churlaud, &amp;amp; Caurant, 2006;
Miramand &amp;amp; Bentley, 1992; Miramand, Bustamante, Bentley, &amp;amp;
Kouéta, 2006).

The primary aim of this work was to quantify the levels of a
high number of essential and toxic elements in the muscle tissue
of three cephalopods species much enjoyed by Portuguese con-
sumers, using various analytical techniques. From a public health
perspective, this study can provide consumers with better knowl-
edge of nutritional characteristics and contamination problems
associated to these species. Additionally, possible relationships

between concentrations and specimen age were also researched,
for all species.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Sample collection and preparation

Octopus (Octopus vulgaris), squid (Loligo vulgaris) and cuttlefish
(Sepia officinalis), were purchased at the Peniche auction, in central
Portugal (Atlantic North-eastern European coast), from May to
September in 2004–2005. Collected specimens were immediately
stored in plastic bags, which were placed in ice and taken to the
laboratory. Upon arrival, mantle length, total weight, sex and
maturity stages were recorded (Table 1). Edible parts (mantle
and arms) were removed and homogenised in a food blender.
Homogenised samples were vacuum-sealed in individual plastic
bags, coded for easy identification, and stored at ?21 ?C until re-
quired for analysis. Specimen age was estimated by growth models
(Bettencourt, 2000; Moreno, Azevedo, Pereira, &amp;amp; Pierce, 2007;
Raya, 2001); the corresponding results are presented in Table 1.

2.2. Analytical methods

Determination of K, Na, Mg, Ca, Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn, Ni, Cd and Pb
levels was performed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry,
according to the procedures described by Jorhem (2000). All anal-
yses were carried out at least in duplicate; an external calibration
method was used for quantitative analysis. Edible portion sam-
ples (5–10 g wet weight) were dry-ashed at 500 ?C under a grad-
ual temperature increase. Ash was dissolved in concentrated
nitric acid and the solution obtained was evaporated to dryness.
The final residue was redissolved with 12 or 5 ml nitric acid
15% (v/v) and transferred to 25 or 10 ml volumetric flasks
(10 ml for Pb, Cd and Ni, 25 ml for other elements); final volumes
were adjusted with ultrapure water. Quantification of these ele-
ments was performed using a Spectr AA-20 spectrophotometer
with deuterium background correction (Varian). Detection limits
(DL, mg kg?1, wet weight) were 0.01 (K), 0.09 (Na), 0.02 (Mg),
0.08 (Ca), 0.06 (Zn), 0.32 (Fe), 0.02 (Cu), 0.01 (Mn), 0.02 (Ni),
0.01 (Cd) and 0.02 (Pb).

Total Hg was determined by cold vapour atomic absorption
spectrometry (CVAAS) according to the procedure developed by
Hatch and Ott (1968) and described by Joiris, Holsbeek, Bouqueg-
neau, and Bossicart (1991). For each specimen, 1 g of homogenised
edible portion sample was digested with concentrated sulphuric
acid. Sample mercury (Hg0 and Hg2þ2 ) was subsequently oxidised
to Hg2+, using potassium permanganate. Following Hg2+ reduction
to Hg0 with stannous chloride, volatile Hg0 was bubbled into the
Bacharach Coleman MAS-50D Mercury Analyser closed system
(k = 253.7 nm). Samples were analysed twice. Concentrations were
calculated by interpolation using a linear calibration curve ob-
tained by measuring the absorbance of standard solutions. The
detection limit was 0.01 mg kg?1, wet weight.

Phosphorus was determined spectrophotometrically according
to ISO Standard 13730 (1996). Samples (5 g wet weight) were
dry-ashed at 500 ?C, followed by acid digestion and colorimetric
measurement of a yellow compound resulting from the reaction
between phosphorus and an ammonium vanadate and ammonium

molybdate mixture, at 430 nm. The detection limit was
0.01 mg kg?1, wet weight.

In order to analyse Cl, S, Br, Sr, Rb and Se, homogenised samples
were freeze-dried for 48 h, at ?45 ?C and low pressure (approxi-
mately 10?1 atm). Samples were powdered and immediately vac-
uum-sealed, in individual coded plastic bags, which were
subsequently stored at ?21 ?C, until further analysis. Concentra-
tions of these six elements were determined using an EDXRF spec-
trometer, according to Carvalho, Santiago, and Nunes (2005).
Powdered samples were pressed into 2.0 cm diameter pellets. Pel-
lets were glued onto Mylar film, on a sample holder, and directly
placed in the path of an X-ray beam, for quantification. Two pellets
were prepared for each tissue sample. The detection limits
(mg kg?1, dry weight) for these elements were 10 (Cl), 10 (S), 0.8
(Br), 0.5 (Sr), 1.1 (Rb) and 0.6 (Se).

Blanks were always tested in the same conditions as the sam-
ples. All laboratory ware was cleaned with HNO3 (10%) or HCl
(20%) for 24–48 h and rinsed with ultrapure water (18.2 MX cm),
to avoid contamination. Chemical reagents were pro analysis or
superior. Commercial standard solutions (Merck, 1000 mg l?1)
were used for some elements.

Analytical data for elements are reported in mg (100 g)?1 or
mg kg?1, depending on element, on a wet weight basis. Mean
moisture content in each species was 78% in cuttlefish and squid
and 83% in octopus. These values were used for the conversion of
results to dry weight basis for comparison with other studies.

Five certified reference materials were tested in the same con-
ditions as the samples, in order to assess analytical method accu-
racy: LUTS-1 (non defatted lobster hepatopancreas), TORT-2
(Lobster hepatopancreas), DORM-2 (Dogfish muscle) from National
Research Council of Canada, SMRD-2000 (Canned matrix meat)
from Swedish Meats R&amp;amp;D and Scan Foods/National Food Adminis-
tration, Sweden and MA-A-2 (Fish flesh) from International Atomic
Energy Agency. Results obtained in this study were in good agree-
ment with certified values (Table 2).

2.3. Statistical analysis

All data were analysed using the STATISTICA 6.1 software (Stat
soft, Inc., Tulsa, OK74104, USA). Pearson’s correlation between
elements was performed. The Student t-test was used to evaluate
the influence of sex on the concentration of various elements, for
each species. Single factor ANOVA analysis was used to confirm
the existence of significant differences between age groups, with-
in the same species. Due to the absence of normality and variance
homogeneity (Lilliefors-test and Levene-test, respectively), the
Kruskal–Wallis non-parametric test was used to evaluate differ-
ences in element concentrations between studied cephalopods
(Zar, 1999). Differences were considered statistically significant
when p &amp;lt;0.05.

pare electrolyte, structural and nutrient element concentrations in
the three cephalopod species. Total concentrations of Hg, Pb and
Cd, metals considered toxic and regulated by the EU Commission
(2006), are summarised in Table 4. Elements with related physio-
logical roles were grouped together. Similar patterns were ob-
served for all elements for the three cephalopod species; in
general terms, the highest concentrations were found in octopus
and the lowest in squid. The main elements were S, Cl, K, Na, P,
Mg and Ca, followed by Br, Zn, Fe, Cu, Sr, Rb, Mn and Ni.

3.2. Electrolytes

The most abundant elements were the electrolytes K, Cl and Na,
as illustrated in Fig. 1. Potassium contributes to the intracellular
ion balance, as a monovalent cation; the two other elements con-
stitute the main extracellular anions and cations, respectively,
assuming an important role in acid–base balance (Lall, 1995).
The chloride concentration was approximately 630 mg (100 g)?1

in octopus; this value was significantly lower in squid (p = 0.000),
of approximately 270 mg (100 g)?1. Chloride data in seafood is
scarce. In a study of fish species performed by Oehlenschläger
(1997), lower values than those found in the present work were
described. Nevertheless, in fish from Indian coastal areas, Cl con-
centrations are the highest, probably due to pollutant organochlo-
rine compounds (Garg &amp;amp; Ramakrishna, 2006). Average Na levels
displayed an identical pattern to Cl. As usually stated for fish, Na
concentration in these cephalopod species is also equal to the mo-
lar amount of Cl. In general, Na contents are considerably higher in
shellfish than in finfish (Vlieg, Lee, &amp;amp; Grace, 1991). The highest con-
centration of this element was found in octopus (572 mg
(100 g)?1), followed by cuttlefish (266 mg (100 g)?1) and squid
(157 mg (100 g)?1). Similar contents were found in other studies
involving molluscs (Lall, 1995; Segar, Collins, &amp;amp; Riley, 1971;
Villanueva &amp;amp; Bustamante, 2006; Vlieg et al., 1991). Octopus was
the cephalopod species showing the lowest K concentration, as op-
posed to other electrolytes (Fig. 1). Average K concentrations were
between 223 mg (100 g)?1, in octopus, and 289 mg (100 g)?1, in
cuttlefish. The average K concentration in octopus was significantly
lower than in cuttlefish (p = 0.01); values for squid were not signif-
icantly different from the average values observed for the other
two species. The range found in this study agrees with those ob-
tained by several authors for cephalopods (Carvalho et al., 2005;
Karakoltsidis, Zotos, &amp;amp; Constantinides, 1995; Lall, 1995; Villanueva
&amp;amp; Bustamante, 2006).

3.3. Structural elements

Phosphorus and sulphur were the main structural elements
found in seafood; in general terms, equal amounts of these two ele-
ments were found in marine species (Oehlenschläger, 1997). In this
study, concentrations ranged between 107 and 285 mg (100 g)?1

and 197 and 444 mg (100 g)?1, respectively (Table 3). Squid
showed the highest average value for P (260 mg (100 g)?1), clearly
above the average 200 mg (100 g)?1 value found in the majority of
seafood. Significant minimum P concentrations were observed in
octopus samples, when compared to squid (p = 0.000) and cuttle-
fish (p = 0.001). Identical amounts were described by Lall (1995),
in octopus, and wild juvenile cephalopods (Villanueva &amp;amp;
Bustamante, 2006). Other authors reported similar concentrations
for bivalve and fish species (Oehlenschläger, 1997; Segar et al.,
1971; Teeny, Gauglitz, Hall, &amp;amp; Houle, 1984). Significantly larger
concentrations of S were found in cuttlefish, when compared to
squid (p = 0.001) and octopus (p = 0.029); the average value was
338 mg (100 g)?1. The lowest average concentration was found in
squid (229 mg (100 g)?1). Vlieg et al. (1991) reported identical re-
sults for some squid species. The highest S concentrations in

juveniles of these three species were reported by Villanueva and
Bustamante (2006).

3.4. Nutrient elements

Regarding macro elements, the lowest levels observed corre-
sponded to Mg and Ca. Fishery products are considered poor
sources of Mg and Ca (Lall, 1995). Nevertheless, Mg concentrations
are always higher than Ca concentrations (Oehlenschläger, 1997).
This fact was also observed this study (Fig. 1). The magnesium:cal-
cium ratio (mg/mg) in cephalopods was approximately 3 or 4. The
average Mg concentration observed in octopus (938 mg kg?1) was
significantly higher than in the other two cephalopod species
(p &amp;lt;0.05), ranging between 651 and 1473 mg kg?1. Squid samples
showed the lowest levels, ranging between 283 and 610 mg kg?1

(Table 3). No significant differences were observed within species

Mean ± sd with equal superscript letters for same element, indicates no statistical differ
in what concerns average Ca levels, although the highest concen-
tration (405 mg kg?1) was found in octopus and the lowest in squid
and cuttlefish (89 mg kg?1). These levels are within the ranges ob-
served by other researchers for some cephalopods, bivalve and gas-
tropoda species (Carvalho et al., 2005; Oehlenschläger, 1997; Segar
et al., 1971; Vlieg et al., 1991), although lower concentrations were
observed in wild juvenile cephalopods in a study performed by
Villanueva and Bustamante (2006). A previous study (Karakoltsidis
et al., 1995) also reported some differences, namely in squid.

Iron, Cu, Zn and Mn are important elements for health. These
elements play the role of functional elements in various metalloen-
zymes, which have particular catalytic function in living organisms.
As frequently observed, concentrations of these elements in cepha-
lopods are high, when compared to other seafood species

1150 H.M. Lourenço et al. / Food Chemistry 113 (2009) 1146–1153
et al., 2004). Of these four elements, zinc concentrations were the
most relevant, corroborating the hypothesis that zinc is always
present in seafood, but concentrations found in molluscs are gener-
ally higher (Celik &amp;amp; Oehlenschläger, 2004; Lall, 1995). In the present
study, average levels reached 17.7 mg kg?1, in octopus and cuttle-
fish samples (Fig. 2 and Table 3), while squid showed the lowest sig-
nificant average value, of 12.6 mg kg?1 (p = 0.000). Similar values
had also been found in previous studies (Miramand &amp;amp; Bentley,
1992; Napoleão et al., 2005; Seixas et al., 2005b; Soldevilla, 1987;
Vlieg et al., 1991). The highest average Cu concentrations, approxi-
mately 4.0 mg kg?1, were found in octopus and cuttlefish samples
(no significant differences were observed), with some samples
reaching 10 mg kg?1. The maximum value found for squid samples
was 1.8 mg kg?1 (Table 3). Soldevilla (1987), Seixas et al. (2005b)
and Napoleão et al. (2005) found identical amounts for the same
octopus species. Nevertheless, some results found in literature for
similar species do not agree with the former (Carvalho et al.,
2005; Miramand &amp;amp; Bentley, 1992; Miramand et al., 2006; Segar
et al., 1971; Villanueva &amp;amp; Bustamante, 2006). In a different study,
high concentrations were found in squid; however the species is
not specified (Lall, 1995). Iron values found in octopus and squid
samples were identical to Cu values (Fig. 2). The highest significant
average Fe concentration, approximately 4.0 mg kg?1, was found in
octopus (p = 0.00); the concentration of this element was only
approximately 1.5 mg kg?1 in squid and cuttlefish. Some authors
observed higher levels (Karakoltsidis et al., 1995; Lall, 1995;
Miramand et al., 2006; Seixas et al., 2005b; Villanueva &amp;amp;
Bustamante, 2006) in identical species caught in other areas; how-
ever, similar concentrations were found in octopus specimens from
the Portuguese coast (Napoleão et al., 2005), the Saharan Fishing
Bank (Soldevilla, 1987) and the French Atlantic coast (Miramand
&amp;amp; Bentley, 1992). Vlieg et al. (1991) also reported higher values than
those observed in this study for arrow squid (Nototodarus sp.) and
broad squid (Sepiotheutis bilineata). These different Fe concentra-
tions may be explained by the different maturity stages of the spec-
imens in question, sampling period and different habitats (Carvalho
et al., 2005). Published data indicate that Mn amounts are generally
low and identical in most seafood species (Astorga España, Rodrí-
guez Rodríguez, &amp;amp; Díaz Romero, 2007; Bustamante et al., 2000;
Oehlenschläger, 1997), although higher concentrations are found
in some lamellibranchia and gastropoda (Segar et al., 1971).
Manganese concentrations in this study were low, ranging between
0.06 and 0.44 mg kg?1, in cuttlefish and octopus, respectively. The
Mn profile was similar to that displayed for Fe (Fig. 2). The highest
average concentration was found in octopus (0.31 mg kg?1), fol-
lowed by squid (0.16 mg kg?1) and cuttlefish (0.11 mg kg?1) (Table
3). These values correspond to the usual concentrations found in
cephalopods (Miramand &amp;amp; Bentley, 1992; Napoleão et al., 2005;
Seixas et al., 2005b; Soldevilla, 1987). Levels were higher in cuttle-
fish juveniles, reaching approximately 1.4 mg kg?1 (Villanueva &amp;amp;
Bustamante, 2006). Significant differences in average Fe, Cu, Zn
and Mn concentrations were always found between squid and octo-
pus (p = 0.003, p = 0.002, p = 0.000 and p = 0.01, respectively).

The concentrations of the last four elements found in this study
suggest that cephalopods may contribute significantly to the daily
intake (DI) needs, especially in what concerns Cu and Zn.

Little is known about the function of Sr and Rb in organisms.
Moreover, the number of studies on the concentrations of these
two elements in fishery products is small; nevertheless, Varo
(1992) found that Sr levels in seafood could be 20 times higher
than in meat. The results of this study indicate that cephalopods
may constitute a good source of Sr. Concentrations found were be-
tween 1.6 mg kg?1 (squid) and 4.7 mg kg?1 (octopus), The Sr pro-
file was identical to that observed for some elements (Figs. 1 and
2); the average concentration in octopus (3.8 mg kg?1) was signif-
icantly higher than those found in cuttlefish (2.3 mg kg?1) and
squid (1.8 mg kg?1). Vlieg et al. (1991) found identical concentra-
tions in squid species. Lamellibranchia and gastropoda species
(Segar et al., 1971) also showed similar levels. Concentrations mea-
sured by Villanueva and Bustamante (2006) in the same species
were higher, particularly in cuttlefish, possibly because this study
focused on juveniles. Lowest concentrations were observed in
studies performed in fish species (Garg &amp;amp; Ramakrishna, 2006;
Teeny et al., 1984). Rubidium concentrations ranged between
0.22 and 0.95 mg kg?1, respectively, in octopus and squid. These
concentrations were lower than Sr concentrations and agree with
the existing literature (Carvalho et al., 2005; Villanueva &amp;amp;
Bustamante, 2006). In a study of fish species from different regions
of India, performed by Garg and Ramakrishna (2006), a large dis-
persion of Rb concentrations was observed. No significant differ-
ences were found between squid and cuttlefish, for both
elements. A similar concentration pattern was observed for Rb
and K in the three species (octopus &amp;lt;squid &amp;lt;cuttlefish), which
can be explained by the electrochemical affinity of these elements.

The last essential trace element analysed was Ni. A few years
ago, the physiological functions of this element were not clear (Lall,
1995). Nowadays it is thought that Ni plays a role in hormone, lipid
and cell membrane metabolism, as well as activating enzymes
associated with the glucose breakdown and use ( Acu-Cell, 2007).
The nickel concentration profile was different from profiles ob-
served for other microelements (Fig. 2). The average levels ob-
served in octopus and squid, of 0.02 mg kg?1 (no significant
differences were found), were lower than the average level ob-
served in cuttlefish, of 0.05 mg kg?1. These concentrations are con-
sidered low, possibly because the specimens collected originate
from an unpolluted ocean area. These results agree with those pub-
lished by other authors (Carvalho et al., 2005; Miramand &amp;amp; Bentley,
1992; Varo, 1992). Nevertheless, Napoleão et al. (2005) and
Villanueva and Bustamante (2006) observed higher concentrations
of Ni in the same octopus species.

3.5. Non-metals

Selenium and bromine are non-metals, classed as essential or
toxic, depending on their concentration (Lall, 1995). Bromine data
in seafood is relatively scarce; however, this element is known to
have anti-seizure properties, as potassium bromide or sodium bro-
mide, appearing to be effective trace elements regarding the pre-
vention of hyperthyroid conditions (Acu-Cell, 2007). In this
study, Br concentrations found in octopus ranged between 26.8
and 40.2 mg kg?1, whereas average Br values found in squid and
cuttlefish samples were lower than those found in octopus (13.3
and 21.5 mg kg?1, respectively). Significant differences were ob-
served between the three species (p = 0.000 for squid/octopus
and p = 0.03 for squid/cuttlefish and octopus/cuttlefish). Garg and
Ramakrishna (2006) found similar average Br concentrations, be-
tween 43 and 93 mg kg?1 (dry weight basis), in fish from different
regions of India, having considered this element as a pollutant.

Selenium in low concentrations, in addition to its role as an
essential micronutrient for normal growth and reproduction, has
a protective effect against toxic elements in organisms (Barghigiani,
Pellegrini, D?Ulivo, &amp;amp; De Ranieri, 1991; Feroci, Badiello, &amp;amp; Fini,
2005). Although Se was found in all samples analysed, the concen-
trations observed ranged between the detection limit (DL) and the
quantification limit (QL). Concentrations found in squid and cuttle-
fish samples were close to the QL (1.0 mg kg?1, dry weight;
approximately 0.2 mg kg?1, wet weight) whereas concentrations
found in octopus were closed to the DL (0.6 mg kg?1, dry weight;
approximately 0.1 mg kg?1, wet weight). Similar values were
found in studies performed in molluscs (Astorga España et al.,
2007; Napoleão et al., 2005; Plessi, Bertelli, &amp;amp; Monzani, 2001;
Seixas et al., 2005b). Seafood species usually showed values

between 0.10 and 0.60 mg kg?1, wet weight basis (Carvalho et al.,
2005; Lall, 1995; Oehlenschläger, 1997; Plessi et al., 2001; Varo,
1992).

3.6. Toxic elements

Non-essential functions are known for Hg, Cd and Pb, which are
considered harmful (Ruiter, 1995). Concentrations in marine organ-
isms reflect environmental pollution (Belitz et al., 2004; Carvalho
et al., 2005; Ruiter, 1995); bioaccumulation and biomagnification
are observed in some organisms. Lead is considered a chronic or
accumulative poison (Seixas et al., 2005b). In the species studied,
Pb concentrations were the lowest, among toxic elements. The pro-
file observed for this element is different from the profiles observed
for the remaining two. Of all samples analysed, squid reached the
highest concentration, 0.14 mg kg?1, representing almost one tenth
of the limit proposed by the EU for cephalopods (1.0 mg kg?1),
whereas average concentrations were low in cuttlefish and octopus
samples, of 0.04 and 0.02 mg kg?1, respectively. These values agree
with the results published by some authors (Martí-Cid, Bocio,
Llobet, &amp;amp; Domingo, 2007; Miramand &amp;amp; Bentley, 1992) despite being
lower than results published by others (Raimundo et al., 2004;
Seixas et al., 2005; Villanueva &amp;amp; Bustamante, 2006).

Mercury is one of the most toxic elements, with seafood repre-
senting one of its major sources in the human food chain (Plessi
et al., 2001). Total Hg levels detected in cephalopods were always
lower than the limit set by the EU (0.5 mg kg?1), in all samples
studied. Average Hg concentrations were similar in octopus and
cuttlefish, of approximately 0.14 mg kg?1; however, maximum
concentrations were found in cuttlefish (0.37 mg kg?1) whereas
the lowest levels, of approximately 0.02 mg kg?1, were found in
squid. These values agree with results reported by other authors,
for the same species (Bustamante et al., 2006; Pierce, Stowasser,
Hastie, &amp;amp; Bustamante, 2007; Villanueva &amp;amp; Bustamante, 2006). In
general terms, it may be said that total Hg concentrations in ceph-
alopods are low (Plessi et al., 2001; Raimundo et al., 2004; Seixas
et al., 2005a, 2005b; Villanueva &amp;amp; Bustamante, 2006) and do not
represent a risk for human consumption.

Molluscs very often accumulate cadmium in digestive glands
(Bustamante et al., 1998); however, minor amounts are also found
in the mantle and arms (Miramand &amp;amp; Bentley, 1992). In most
organisms, this element may compete with Fe, Cu and Zn, which
turns its presence into a serious hazard (Carvalho et al., 2005).
Regarding the cephalopods studied, modest average amounts were
found in squid (0.04 mg kg?1), when compared to octopus and cut-
tlefish, in which average concentrations of 0.38 and 0.31 mg kg?1

were found, respectively (Table 4). In squid, data obtained agrees
with data obtained by other authors (Martí-Cid et al., 2007; Pierce
et al., 2007; Villanueva &amp;amp; Bustamante, 2006). The limit proposed by
the EU for cadmium (1.0 mg kg?1) was reached in one cuttlefish
sample and exceeded in two octopus samples, despite this fact
the average levels did not exceed the indicative value. Bustamante
et al. (1998), Raimundo et al. (2004) and Miramand et al. (2006)
found identical concentrations for similar species. Nevertheless,
lower concentrations were reported in cuttlefish, in different stud-
ies (Martí-Cid et al., 2007; Miramand &amp;amp; Bentley, 1992; Villanueva &amp;amp;
Bustamante, 2006). In octopus, some authors also observed higher
levels (Seixas et al., 2005b; Soldevilla, 1987), possibly due to the
different environments.

In general terms, mean and median concentrations of these
toxic elements are identical (Table 4), which indicates that the
cephalopod population in the study habitat may be well-known.
Statistical analysis performed for these three toxic metals did not
reveal significant differences between octopus and cuttlefish. This
fact shows that squid must have a different behaviour from the
other two cephalopod species, probably due to its size and diet.
3.7. Influence of age, sex and relationships between element levels

Comparison between age groups was performed for each spe-
cies. Differences in Hg concentrations were only found in squid.
No significant differences were found between age groups in octo-
pus and cuttlefish. Several studies were performed in seafood to
test the significance of differences or find correlations between
age or size and Hg concentrations; however, the results obtained
were inconsistent (Pierce et al., 2007; Raimundo et al., 2004; Seixas
et al.,2005a, 2005b). In a similar way to what occurred in the pres-
ent study, Pierce et al. (2007) found that body size was a significant
factor in Loligo forbesi, whereas other authors (Raimundo et al.,
2004; Seixas et al., 2005b) did not find any significant differences
in octopus. Significant differences in element concentrations with
sex were only found for Mn and only in squid and cuttlefish
(p = 0.001 and p = 0.03, respectively). Mn concentrations were
higher in females of these two species, probably due to reproduc-
tive requirements.

Numerous positive and negative correlations were observed
among elements for all cephalopod species (data not show). Some
of the most significant (p &amp;lt;0.005 and absolute correlation coeffi-
cient r P 0.8000) positive correlations found were between K/
Mg/Zn, Mn/Fe, Zn/Cu, Fe/Cd, and Cu/Cd. In octopus some negative
correlations were also found, such as Sr/K and Sr/P. Seixas et al.
(2005b) found similar relationships with Cd. These correlations
may be explained by the Cd interaction with the metabolism of
these essential metals (Peraza, Ayala-Fierro, Barber, Casarez, &amp;amp;
Rael, 1998).

3.8. Daily and provisional tolerable weekly element intakes

Several suggestions have been made regarding daily intake
(DI) values relative to elements (Belitz et al., 2004; Lall, 1995;
Oehlenschläger, 1997). The values proposed by Belitz et al. (2004)
and Acu-cell (2007) are listed in Table 5. Considering the concentra-
tions found in the present work, DI percentages for each element
are also shown in Table 5. Analysis of the results included in this ta-
ble shows that cephalopods may contribute significantly to the DI
of S, P, Mg, Zn and Cu, representing 10–38% of the DI. Daily intakes
of Ni and Sr are also important. Additionally, Ca, Fe and Mn percent-
ages are small, ranging between 0.3% and 3%. The Na percentage
(based on minimum intake for good health) is higher than the K
percentage, especially for octopus, which indicates a high Na/K ra-
tio. This fact is important, since some studies suggest an increased
risk of developing high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease
(Astorga España et al., 2007). The contribution of octopus and cut-
tlefish is more relevant than that of squid, in general terms. This dif-



1152 H.M. Lourenço et al. / Food Chemistry 113 (2009) 1146–1153
ference could be explained by a different diet. According to the Joint
Food and Agriculture Organisation/World Health Organisation
(FAO/WHO) (WHO, 1999, 2003) provisional tolerable weekly in-
takes (PTWI) for Hg, Cd and Pb are 5 lg kg?1 body weight, 7 lg kg?1

body weight and 25 lg kg?1 body weight, respectively. With basis
on a weekly average consumption of fishery products in Portugal
of 1120 g (160 g/day) (FAO, 2007), an average human body weight
of 60 kg and the average Hg, Cd and Pb values found in this study
(Table 4), estimated weekly intakes of Hg and Pb are much lower
than established PTWIs, for all three species. Nevertheless, the
PTWI of 7 lg kg?1 body weight for cadmium is almost reached or
slightly exceeded when cuttlefish (6.7 lg kg?1 body weight) and
octopus (9.7 lg kg?1 body weight) are consumed. However, it
would be very unlikely for a person to consume the aforementioned
amounts of these species per week; therefore, the values obtained
are overestimated.

4. Conclusion

The elemental profile is quite similar for the three species stud-
ied, the major elements being Cl, Na, K, S, P, Mg and Ca, followed by
Br, Zn, Fe, Cu, Sr, Rb, Se, Mn and Ni. This indicates that these ele-
ments may have the same physiological importance in the three
cephalopod species. Results obtained in this study also suggest that
cephalopods may constitute a good source of some essential ele-
ments, such as P, Mg, Zn and Cu. In general, comparison of element
concentrations in octopus, squid and cuttlefish shows that the low-
est concentrations of most elements are found in squid; therefore,
its contribution for DIs is lower than that of the other two species.
Regarding Hg and Pb intakes, consumption does not guide to any
concerns, although it should be moderate when considering Cd in-
take, especially regarding octopus.

Abstract

BACKGROUND: Among seafood products, crustaceans are an important group owing to their nutritional benefits and high
market value. The aim of this study was to evaluate the proximate composition as well as essential and non-essential elements
in the edible muscle of Nephrops norvegicus (Norway lobster).

RESULTS: The studied crustacean showed a high protein level of about 210 g kg?1 and a mineral level of about 24 g kg?1 . The
pattern for the elements studied was Cl &gt; Na &gt; K &gt; P &gt; S &gt; Ca &gt; Mg &gt; Br &gt; Fe &gt; Sr ? Zn &gt; Cu &gt; Mn &gt; Rb &gt; Se &gt; Ni &gt; Cr.
Regarding non-essential elements, the average total Hg content was 0.40 mg kg?1 , but two samples exceeded the legal limit
set by the European Union (EU) for Hg in crustaceans (0.50 mg kg?1 ). The levels of Pb and Cd found in all samples were below
the EU limits (0.50 mg kg?1 for both metals).

CONCLUSION: Nephrops norvegicus is a good source of protein and contains most minerals at levels sufficient to satisfy the
dietary reference intake. The amounts of Pb and Cd are not a concern. Hg levels indicate some contamination; however, taking
into account the type of consumption of this species, it can be concluded that this does not represent a risk in terms of the

INTRODUCTION
The importance of seafood products in a balanced diet is well
known. They are protein-rich with a good amino acid composition
and a high proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids.1,2 These
products contain most of the 90 elements that appear in nature.3,4

C, H, N, O and S (structural elements) followed by macroelements
such as Cl, K, P, Na, Mg and Ca constitute the largest amounts
found.1,4 Other elements such as Fe, Cu, Zn, I, Mn, Se, Ni and
Cr occur in lower concentrations and are considered trace or
ultratrace elements. Depending on their physiological functions,
elements are classified as either essential when their functions are
well confirmed or non-essential when their roles have not been
well demonstrated.4 Some elements such as Br and Sn remain to
be classified. Hg, Pb and Cd are non-essential elements found in
marine fish products. Since 2001 there have been legal limits set
by the European Union (EU)5,6 on Hg, Pb and Cd levels in several
types of food, including seafood.

Among seafood products, crustaceans are important not only
owing to their nutritional properties but also because of their
high market value.7 Shellfish are widely consumed in Southern
Europe; for example, the annual consumption per capita in
Portugal reached 11.5 kg in 2006.8 Nephrops norvegicus (Norway
lobster) production in 2007 was 226.5 t out of 970.9 t of
total crustacean catches.9 In spite of this, the biochemical
composition of some deep-sea crustacean species has not
been studied to the same extent as that of others.10 Several
studies have been done in an attempt to determine trace

metal accumulation in crustaceans instead of studying element
benefits.11 – 20

The aim of this study was to characterise the edible muscle of
N. norvegicus in terms of proximate and elemental composition
and therefore to contribute to a better knowledge of nutritional
benefits and hazards of this species.

EXPERIMENTAL
Sample collection and preparation
Nephrops norvegicus specimens were caught off the southwestern
Portuguese coast, Algarve (Portima?o, 36? 47.6? N, 8? 9.7? W, depth
377 m; Sagres, 36? 55.4? N, 9? 7.3? W, depth 589 m) by the R/V
Noruega from Instituto Nacional dos Recursos Biolo?gicos in 2004.
Collected specimens were immediately frozen on board, stored
in plastic bags, transported to the laboratory and kept at ?21 ?C

IV 46 – 48 61 – 73 2 pools (10 , 10 )

V 55 – 57 104 – 128 2 pools (10 , 10 )

until preparation. After thawing at room temperature, carapace
length, total weight and sex were recorded (Table 1). The male and
female are distinguished by a difference in shape of the first pair
of pleopodes: they are rigid and amended in the copulation organ
in males, while they are much thinner and flexible in females.
Ten composite samples (ten specimens in each) of edible muscle,
five for males and five for females, two pools for each carapace
length class (28 – 30, 34 – 36, 40 – 42, 46 – 48 and 55 – 57 mm), were
obtained and homogenised in a food blender. Homogenised
samples were vacuum sealed in individual plastic bags, coded for
easy identification and stored at ?21 ?C until required for analysis.
Sample analysis
The proximate composition – protein (Kjeldahl method), fat (Soxh-
let extraction with ethyl ether), moisture (sample dried overnight
at 105 ?C) and ash (sample incinerated at 500 ?C to constant
weight) – was determined according to AOAC methods.21

Quantification of K, Na, Mg, Ca, Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn, Ni, Cr,
Cd and Pb levels was performed by flame atomic absorption
spectrometry (FAAS) according to Jorhem.22 The method is based
on sample (10 – 15 g) incineration and dissolution in HNO3 . All
analyses were carried out at least in duplicate using a Spectr
AA-20 spectrometer (Varian Australia, Mulgrave, Australia) with
deuterium background correction. Quantification was made by
the external calibration method. Detection limits (DLs, mg kg?1
wet weight) were calculated from the residual standard deviation
(RSD) of the response and the slope (S) of the calibration curve for
each element: DL = 3.3 × RSD/S. The values obtained were 0.01
(K), 0.09 (Na), 0.02 (Mg), 0.08 (Ca), 0.06 (Zn), 0.32 (Fe), 0.02 (Cu), 0.01
(Mn), 0.02 (Ni), 0.09 (Cr), 0.01 (Cd) and 0.02 (Pb) mg kg?1 wet weight.

Total Hg was determined by cold vapour atomic absorption
according to the method developed by Hatch and Ott23 and
described by Joiris et al.24 using a Coleman MAS-50D mercury anal-
yser system (Bacharach, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA). In this method,
homogenised samples (1 g) are first digested with concentrated
H2 SO4 , then Hg is oxidised to Hg

2+ with 50 g L?1 potassium per-
manganate. Subsequently, Hg is reduced to Hg0 with 200 g L?1
stannous chloride, and the volatile Hg0 is bubbled into the closed
system of the mercury analyser. All samples were analysed in
duplicate. Concentrations were calculated from linear calibration
obtained by measurement of the absorbance of standard solutions.
The DL (calculated as above) was 0.01 mg kg?1 wet weight.

P was determined spectrophotometrically according to ISO
13 73025 using a UNICAM UV 5 220 spectrophotometer (ATI UNI-
CAM, Cambridge, UK) In this method, samples (5 g) are incinerated
and dissolved in 200 g L?1 HCl. Colorimetric measurements are
performed on the yellow compound obtained from the reaction
of P with a mixture of ammonium vanadate and ammonium
molybdate. Quantification was made by the external calibration
method. The DL (calculated as above) was 0.01 mg kg?1 wet
weight.

All laboratory ware was cleaned with 100 g L?1 HNO3 or
200 g L?1 HCl for 24 – 48 h and rinsed with ultrapure water
(18.2 M? cm). All chemicals were of reagent grade. Commercial
standard solutions (1 g L?1) for K, Na, Mg, Ca, Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn, Ni, Cr,
Cd, Pb, Hg and P (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were used.

To analyse Cl, S, Br, Sr, Rb and Se, samples were freeze-dried
(48 h at ?40 ?C and ?0.1 atm), pulverised, immediately vacuum
sealed in individual coded plastic bags and stored at ?21 ?C until
further analysis. Determination of these six elements was carried
out according to Carvalho et al.26 using an energy-dispersive
X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) spectrometer consisting of a PW 1140
X-ray tube (100 kV, 80 mA; Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands)
equipped with a changeable Mo secondary target and Si(Li)
detector (Oxford, High Wycombe, UK). The energy resolution was
135 eV at 5.9 keV and the acquisition system was a Nucleus PCA
card (Oxford, High Wycombe, UK). Two pellets were prepared for
each sample. DLs (mg kg?1 dry weight) for these elements were
determined by the signal-to-noise approach, where the equipment
compares the signal of each element with blank samples and
establishes the minimum concentration at which the element is
reliably detected. The values obtained were 10 (Cl), 10 (S), 0.8 (Br),
0.5 (Sr), 1.1 (Rb) and 0.6 (Se) mg kg?1 dry weight.

Analytical data for elements are reported as g kg?1 or mg kg?1
on a wet weight basis.

Five certified reference materials were tested under the same
conditions as the samples in order to assess the accuracy of
the analytical method: LUTS-1 (National Research Council of
Canada, Ottawa, Canada) non-defatted lobster hepatopancreas
(used only in the FAAS technique for essential elements); TORT-2
(National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa, Canada) lobster
hepatopancreas; DORM-2, dogfish muscle (National Research
Council of Canada, Ottawa, Canada); SMRD-2000, canned matrix
meat (Swedish Meats R&amp;amp;D and Scan Foods/National Food Adminis-
tration, Ka?vlinge, Sweden); MA-A-2, fish flesh (International Atomic
Energy Agency, Vienne, Austria) (used only in EDXRF technique).
The results obtained in this study were in good agreement with
the certified values (Table 2).

Considering the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI,
expressed in mg kg?1) of non-essential metals, a portion of seafood
and a person’s body weight (BW, expressed in kg), one can estimate
the maximum number of meals (X ) that can be consumed:

X = (PTWI × BW)/(C × D)
where C is the mean concentration of metals in seafood (expressed
in mg kg?1) and D is the portion of seafood (expressed in g) per
meal.

Statistical analysis
All data analysis was carried out using Statistica 6.1 (StatSoft,
Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA). Normality and variance homogeneity were
confirmed by the Lilliefors test and the Levene test respectively.27

The Pearson correlation between elements was determined. The
Student t test was used to verify the influence of sex on various
elements. Significant differences were considered at P &amp;lt;0.05.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The proximate chemical composition of N. norvegicus edible
muscle showed the normal pattern for crustaceans.2,28,29 Thus
the protein content, about 210 g kg?1 (206 ± 7 g kg?1), was similar
to that found by Rosa and Nunes10 in the same lobster species and
by Go?koðolu and Yerlikaya30 in Portunus pelagicus (swim crab).

Chemical characterisation of Nephrops norvegicus www.soci.org

The mean mineral content ranged from 23.3 to 26.1 g kg?1, in
agreement with values recorded in P. pelagicus and Callinectes
sapidus (blue crab)30,31 but higher than those found in fish.1 The
fat content was always lower than 10 g kg?1 and the moisture
content ranged between 750 and 800 g kg?1. These values are
also in accordance with those published in the literature.10,31,32

Tables 3 and 4 present the concentrations (mean, standard
deviation (SD) and range) of macroelements and trace elements
respectively found in N. norvegicus edible muscle. The profile for
mineral content was Cl &gt; Na &gt; K &gt; P &gt; S &gt; Ca &gt; Mg &gt; Br &gt;
Fe &gt; Sr ? Zn &gt; Cu &gt; Mn &gt; Rb &gt; Se &gt; Ni &gt; Cr. There were no
significant differences between males and females in the levels of
any of these elements (P &gt; 0.05).

The major elements present in N. norvegicus muscle were K, Cl
and Na. Of these, K contributes to the intracellular ion balance as
a monovalent cation, while Cl and Na are the main extracellular
anion and cation respectively, assuming an important role in
the acid – base balance.4 The mean levels of K, Cl and Na were
about 3.4, 4.7 and 4.4 g kg?1 respectively. The mean content
found for Cl is much higher than that reported by Causeret3 and
Oehlenschla?ger1 in fish species (average ?1 g kg?1). A higher
level of K was observed by Karakoltsidis et al.32 in the same
lobster species (8.0 g kg?1). This discrepancy could be due to the
different geographical catching areas or even to the season. In
contrast, some authors observed lower levels of Na and K in blue
crab (3.2 and 3.0 g kg?1 respectively), European lobster (3.2 and
2.6 g kg?1 respectively) and American lobster (2.0 and 2.6 g kg?1

respectively).30,33 Nevertheless, the values found for these two
elements in the present study are comparable to those reported
in other shellfish species.4,26

P and S were the second most abundant elements in
N. norvegicus muscle. In living organisms, 80 – 85% of P is present
in bones, the remainder being found in extracellular fluids,
intracellular structures and cell membranes.4 P is directly involved
in energy-producing cellular reactions.4 S is present in amino acids,
polypeptides, proteins and enzymes. The mean contents of these
two elements were 2.3 and 1.4 g kg?1 respectively. Values of S
content are scarce in the literature; however, a study by Vlieg
et al.34 showed concentrations of S between 1.3 and 2.2 g kg?1 in
three species of crustaceans, while Barrento et al.33 reported levels
around 1.7 g kg?1 in European and American lobsters. Levels of
P are identical to those indicated by other authors in fish1,35 and
some shellfish.34,36,37 Crustaceans such as blue and swim crabs
showed a slightly lower content.30,31 The similar results found for
other crustaceans of different habitat, depth and genus indicate
that different crustacean species use and metabolise these two
elements in an identical manner.

Two cations that are essential nutrients for life are Ca and Mg.
Ca participates in a number of regulatory functions, while Mg
is essential for energy-requiring biological functions.4 Seafood
is considered a poor source of these elements, and fish species
generally contain more Mg than Ca.1 However, N. norvegicus
muscle showed higher concentrations of these elements, with
the mean content of Ca being greater than that of Mg (1.0 and
0.6 g kg?1 respectively). It is commonly accepted that crustaceans
show this pattern owing to a biomineralisation process. In fact,
crustaceans have a particularly active Ca metabolism and have
the ability to form cyclically not only an external structure but
also Ca storage forms.38 Other authors have also indicated higher
Ca than Mg levels in such species.4,28,33,39 Thus, compared with
other seafood, N. norvegicus can be a good source of Ca in human
nutrition.

Data on Br in seafood are scarce, but it is known that this
non-metallic element in the form of potassium bromide or sodium
bromide has anti-seizure properties and seems to be an effective
trace mineral in regard to hyperthyroid conditions.40 According to
Varo,36 the average Br concentration in fish is about 2 mg kg?1. In
the present study, N. norvegicus showed higher amounts ranging
from 26.8 to 44.3 mg kg?1. Barrento et al.20,33 and Mohapatra
et al.41 also found levels around 20 mg kg?1 or even higher in
some crustaceans. These high concentrations of Br in crustaceans
are probably due to species biology, habitat, food source and
environment.

Shellfish usually show high levels of Fe, Zn and Cu and in this
sense could make a good contribution to the daily requirement
of these elements, which play an important role in human life.
As constituents of metalloenzymes, Fe, Zn and Cu give rise to
particular catalytic functions: Fe is essential in the transport,
storage and utilisation of oxygen; Zn controls many processes of
carbohydrate, lipid and protein metabolism and nucleoprotein
synthesis; Cu is a cofactor for enzymes involved in glucose
metabolism and haemoglobin synthesis. In crustaceans, Cu is
required by the respiratory pigment haemocyanin. Many studies
have been performed to determine levels of these three elements,
some of them in crustaceans caught in several areas.14,15,32,33,42,43

In the investigated species, high contents of Fe, Zn and Cu
were reported. The mean concentrations of Fe, Zn and Cu
found in N. norvegicus in the present study were 20.0, 17.4 and
10.6 mg kg?1, with the largest quantity being detected for Fe
(35.4 mg kg?1). A different result was obtained by Capelli et al.44

for N. norvegicus caught in the Ligurian Sea, where Zn and Cu
contents were lower (13 and 6.2 mg kg?1 respectively). However,
some studies performed on lobsters, shrimps and crabs indicated
similar concentrations of Fe, Zn and Cu to those detected in the
present study.17,19,45,46 Data presented for the three elements in
N. norvegicus edible muscle are in close agreement for this type of
crustacean, which is one of the seafood species that can be a good
source for human daily intake of Fe, Zn and Cu.

Few data are available on Sr and Rb in seafood, and the functions
of these elements in organisms are unknown. The present study
indicated a global mean Sr concentration of 17.8 mg kg?1 in
N. norvegicus edible muscle. Levels of Rb (0.23 – 0.67 mg kg?1) were
lower than those of Sr, in agreement with the literature.26,47,48

Agusa et al.,49 on the other hand, reported higher Rb than Sr
levels in some fish species from several locations in Cambodia,
Indonesia and Thailand. In a study by Seixas and Pierce,50 Octopus
vulgaris showed Rb levels between 3 and 5 mg kg?1 dry weight,
somewhat higher than those found in N. norvegicus. Species of
Lamellibranchiata and Gastropoda showed similar levels of Sr to
those observed in N. norvegicus in the present study.37 Another
study reported values around 35 mg kg?1 in other lobsters.33 Some
fish species contained less Sr,26 while others from Manila Bay,
especially demersal fish, accumulated higher levels,47 probably
owing to high levels of water contamination. A study by Varo36

revealed lower levels of Sr and Rb in canned shrimp (11 and
0.2 mg kg?1 respectively).

The transition metal Mg is important as a cofactor activating a
high number of enzymes to form metal – enzyme complexes and
also as a constituent of certain metalloenzymes.4 For example, the
enzymatic function of Mn in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism
and brain function is well known. The mean Mn concentration
found in N. norvegicus was 0.75 mg kg?1. This is considerably
higher than the values usually found in fish and is in accordance
with the report by Lall4 that molluscs and crustaceans contain

significantly higher levels of this element than fish. According
to Baden et al.,51 the level of Mn in N. norvegicus specimens
gives an indication of recent exposure to Mn concentrations in
the bottom waters of their habitats. Several authors observed
similar contents of Mn in N. norvegicus29,32,44 and other decapod
crustaceans.14,15,17,33 A study by Kress et al.52 showed high
Mn levels in some deep-sea crustaceans (Polycheles tylaphlops,
Acnthephyra eximia and Aristeus antennatus) from the southeastern
Mediterranean Sea.

Ni and Cr are the last two trace elements studied that can be
considered essential, depending on their concentration in tissues.
At low levels, Ni is thought to be a factor in hormone, lipid and
cell membrane metabolism. Insulin response is increased after
Ni ingestion, which may be related to Ni activation of enzymes
associated with the breakdown or utilisation of glucose. The most
important physiological role of Cr is also to enhance the action
of insulin.40 Generally, the concentrations of these elements are
low in seafood (0.01 – 0.5 mg kg?1).1,36 In the present study the
content of Ni averaged 0.16 mg kg?1, reaching 0.34 mg kg?1 in
one sample. These levels are in the range of values reported by
Carvalho et al.26 in fish species but are lower than those reported
by Pae?z-Osuna et al.14 and Canli et al.53 in lobster (1.5 mg kg?1 dry
weight) and prawn (?2.7 mg kg?1 dry weight) respectively. The
high values obtained by these two groups of authors are probably
due to environmental metal pollution in the studied geographical
regions. Segar et al.37 also detected high amounts of Ni in mollusc
species. Studies performed on bivalve and cephalopod species
from New Caledonia lagoon also showed high levels of Ni.54,55

These high values can be explained by the intense land-based
Ni-mining activity in the area and also by urban development and
lack of efficient wastewater treatment. Levels of Cr were similar
to those of Ni, with a mean value of 0.13 mg kg?1 and a range
from 0.05 to 0.23 mg kg?1. Some authors reported similar results
in crustaceans.4,14,15,42 Fish species showed higher levels of Cr
in some studies (1 – 2.4 mg kg?1 dry weight),26,56 but a study by
Agusa et al.49 on fish from Southeast Asia showed values in the
same range as those obtained in the present study. The low values

found for Ni and Cr in N. norvegicus edible muscle probably indicate
a non-contaminated catching area.

Se is considered both an essential element and a toxic element
depending on its concentration. It is a component of the enzyme
glutathione peroxidase in human and animal tissues, and Se
deficiency is implicated in cardiovascular disease and higher risk
of cancer of several organs such as the liver and lungs.40 In contrast,
Se excess can have toxic effects,57 among which is the promotion
of dental caries.4 Some studies reported a role of Se against the
toxicity of Hg, more precisely methyl mercury.4,57 – 59 Although Se
was detected in N. norvegicus, the values were near the limit of
quantification (1.5 mg kg?1 dry weight) and showed a large error
in variability. However, it can be estimated that levels were around
0.4 mg kg?1, which is within the range observed in several seafood
species.1,19,57,60 – 62

Dietary reference intake (DRI) is a general term encompassing
a set of reference values for specific nutrients: estimated
average requirement (EAR), recommended dietary allowance
(RDA), adequate intake (AI) and tolerable upper intake level
(UL).63 Some suggestions have been made for mineral reference
values.1,2,4,40,63 Those proposed by Belitz et al.2 and IOM63 are
given in Table 5. Taking into consideration the levels found in the
present study, the contribution of each element to the DRI is also
shown in Table 5. These results allow one to conclude that, in
general, N. norvegicus is a good source of minerals, particularly Cu,
Zn, Mg, Se and P, with Cu and Se being above the DRI. However,
the ULs set by IOM63 for Cu (10 mg day?1 ) and Se (0.4 mg day?1 )
are above the values obtained in the present study (1.7 mg Cu
and&amp;lt;0.06 mg Se in a 160 g portion). Additionally, the Mn and Ni
values are minimal, ranging between 3 and 7%. The Na/K ratio
is high, which can indicate an increased risk of developing high
blood pressure and cardiovascular disease.64

Table 6 presents data for the non-essential metals Hg, Cd and Pb.
To date, no essential function in human life has been attributed
to these metals.58 Furthermore, their connection with several
diseases is well known. Elemental Hg, inorganic Hg (Hg2+) and, in
particular, organic forms such as methyl mercuric ion (CH3Hg

+) are
considered neurotoxic, with the brain being the principal target

organ. The most pronounced damage caused by Cd occurs in the
kidneys, but high Cd levels are also associated with coronary artery
disease, hypertension, emphysema and other chronic pulmonary
diseases. Pb also has many adverse health effects, e.g. toxicity
to renal, endocrine and skeletal systems, but its primary effect is
on the central nervous system.59 It is thought that these three
elements are also cancerigenic. Depending on the habitat and
species examined, different levels of Hg can be detected. It was
the most abundant toxic metal in N. norvegicus, with a mean
content of 0.40 mg kg?1. Two samples exceeded the permitted
value of 0.50 mg kg?1,5,6 reaching about 0.70 mg kg?1. Capelli
et al.44 found similar contents of Hg in N. norvegicus. A study
by Barghigiani and De Ranieri65 on the same species revealed
similar values for minor length classes but larger values for
major length classes. Another study by Drava et al.17 detected
higher levels in red shrimp (A. antennatus). However, in other
crustaceans, lower concentrations were found.19,57,66,67 The mean
contents of Cd and Pb detected in the present study were
0.10 and 0.05 mg kg?1 respectively. These values are significantly
lower than the limits set by the EU5,6 (0.50 mg kg?1 for both
elements). Several authors reported higher concentrations in some
crustacean species, but those samples were harvested from waters
considered polluted.15,53,68,69 Others found similar or lower values
of Cd11,14,17,19,44,66 and Pb17,19,66 compared with the present study.
In a study of Hg and Cd uptake from seawater and food by N.
norvegicus,70 all treatments resulted in the accumulation of both
elements. However, the tissue distribution of the metals differed
significantly among treatments. In the case of edible muscle the
levels obtained for Hg and Cd in N. norvegicus can be attributed
to diet or habitat waters. However, Cd only reached its highest
concentration in the hepatopancreas. As for essential elements,
no significant gender differences were detected in N. norvegicus
regarding Hg, Pb and Cd levels (P &gt; 0.05). This was also found by
Canli and Furness13 in tail muscle tissue of the same species.

Provisional tolerable weekly intakes (PTWIs) of 5, 7 and 25 µg
kg?1 were established for Hg, Cd and Pb respectively.71,72 Taking
into consideration an average weekly consumption of seafood
products in Portugal of 1120 g,73 an average human BW of 60 kg
and the average Hg, Cd and Pb levels found in this study (Table 6),
the estimated weekly intakes of Cd (1.9 µg kg?1 BW) and Pb (0.9 µg
kg?1 BW) are lower than their established PTWIs. In contrast, the
PTWI for Hg is exceeded (7.5 µg kg?1 BW) if N. norvegicus is
consumed in this way (160 g portion × 7 days). However, it is very
unlikely that a person will consume that quantity of this species in
a single week, so the value can be considered overestimated.

Positive Pearson correlations occurred between some elements,
the most significant being those of Mn with Na (R2 = 0.878,

P = 0.000), Ca (R2 = 0.746, P = 0.001), Mg (R2 = 0.867,
P = 0.000), Fe (R2 = 0.742, P = 0.001) and Ni (R2 = 0.815,
P = 0.000). These correlations can be explained by the similar
chemistry of the Mn and Mg ions4 and probably Ca and Na and the
electrochemical affinity of Mn with other transition metals such as
Fe and Ni.

CONCLUSIONS
Nephrops norvegicus can be a good source of protein and have a
rich mineral content. The major elements present were Cl &gt; Na &gt;
K &gt; P &gt; S &gt; Ca &gt; Mg followed by trace elements Br &gt; Fe &gt; Sr ? Zn
&gt; Cu &gt; Mn &gt; Rb &gt; Se &gt; Ni &gt; Cr. Considering the DRI, this species
may constitute a good supply of several essential elements such as
Cu, Zn, Mg and P. However, the Na/K ratio is high, which can be a
concern for consumers with cardiovascular diseases. The contents
of Pb and Cd are low and consumption of N. norvegicus is not a
concern in this respect. Regarding the PTWI for Hg, the studied
species should be consumed in moderation, preferably no more
than four 160 g meals per week.

ABSTRACT 

Farmed gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata), European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), 

rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and turbot (Psetta maxima) were analysed in 

order to characterize proximate composition and essential and toxic elements 

concentrations. All species presented a high protein level, around 20 g (100 g)
-1

 and a 

mineral content of about 1 g (100 g)
-1

. Similar patterns of macro, trace and ultra trace 

elements were observed for all studied fish species, although, some different levels 

occurred among them. The main elements were K, Na, P, Mg and Ca, followed by Zn, 

Fe, Cu, Cr, Mn and Ni. Cadmium, Hg and Pb concentrations, obtained in this study, 

allow concluding that these species do not present a risk for human consumption. In 

addition, they contain almost all essential elements at concentrations sufficient to suit 

the dietary reference intake. Nevertheless, P. maxima contribution for elemental dietary 

reference intake is minor in comparison to the other three species. 

 

Keywords: Sparus aurata; Dicentrarchus labrax; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Psetta

1. Introduction  

Fish is a good source of proteins and lipids of high biological value, with long chain 

polyunsaturated fatty acids, and also liposoluble vitamins (Belitz, 2004) and essential 

elements (Oehlenschäger, 1997). Epidemiological studies indicate that populations with 

a fish diet have a lower risk of coronary heart disease, hypertension and cancer 

(Simopolpoulos, 1997). Lack of essential elements, like Na, K, P, Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe, Cu 

and Zn leads to improper or poor enzyme mediated metabolic functions and results in 

organ malfunctions, chronical diseases and finally in death (Oehlenschäger, 1997). 

However, in spite of fish being considered a food product indispensable in a balanced 

diet, such products can, to a certain extent, be contaminated with some chemicals 

coming from several sources (industrial waste discharge and other anthropogenic 

activities). Some of these chemicals that can be accumulated are Hg, Cd and Pb. These 

elements can be toxic even in low concentrations, causing severe human health 

disorders (Francesconi, 2007). 

Nowadays, aquaculture comprises an important alternative to those traditional forms 

of fish stock. In Portugal, farmed fish play, even today, a small part comparing with 

fisheries (EC, 2008). According Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 

Nations (FAO), in the year of 2030, aquaculture will dominate the market and probably 

only less than the half of consumed fish products will come of traditional fisheries 

(FAO, 2003). Among farmed fish species in EU, gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata 

Linnaeus 1758), European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax Linnaeus 1758), rainbow 

trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum 1792) and turbot (Psetta maxima Linnaeus 1758) 

observed special attention. Their productions have been increasing in the last years, 

being generally commercialised as fresh fish (Testi et al., 2006). 



In this context, the aim of this study was to determine the proximate composition and 

the essential and toxic element contents in the edible muscle of gilthead sea bream, 

European sea bass, rainbow trout and turbot collected in Portuguese fish farms. 

Additionally, these values were compared with the dietary reference intakes (DRI) and 

maximum limit levels. 

 

2. Materials and methods 

2.1 Raw material and sample preparation 

S. aurata, D. labrax, O. mykiss and P. maxima were purchased from several 

commercial farms located in Portugal. Immediately after collection, farmed fish were 

stored in ice inside an insulated box and transferred to the laboratory where specimens 

were weighed, measured (total body length) and processed. Mean length, mean weight 

and number of sampled fish are presented in Table 1. Muscle tissue from each fish was 

minced, mixed and homogenised in a food blender. Homogenised samples were 

vacuum-sealed in clean plastic bags, coded for easy identification, and stored at –21 ºC 

until required for analysis.  

2.2 Sample analysis 

Proximate composition - protein (nitrogen x 6.25; Kjeldahl method), fat (Soxhlet 

extraction with ethyl ether), moisture (sample dried overnight at 105ºC), and ash 

(sample incineration at 500 º C to constant weight) - was done according to Association 

of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) methodologies (AOAC, 1998). Analytical data 

for proximate composition are reported as g (100 g) 
–1

 on a wet weight basis. One 

certified reference material was tested (n = 4) in the same conditions as the samples, in 

order to assess analytical method accuracy: SMRD-2000 (Canned matrix meat) from 

Swedish Meats R &amp;amp; D and Scan Foods/ National Food Administration. The values of 



the reference material were 1.63 ± 0.05 (1.62 ± 0.06), 14.3 ± 0.4 (14.4 ± 0.1), 68.8 ± 0.1 

(68.7 ± 0.1) and 2.65 ± 0.07 (2.69 ± 0.03) for nitrogen, fat, moisture and ash, 

respectively. The values of present measurements are given in parentheses. The values 

obtained were in good agreement with the certified values. 

 

Potassium (K), sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), 

zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) 

analysis was based on the methods described by Jorhem (2000). Muscle samples (5 or 

10 g wet weight) were dried and then ashed at 500 ºC with gradual increase in 

temperature. Nitric acid 65 % (w/w) was added, and the solution obtained was 

evaporated to dryness. The final residue was dissolved in nitric acid 15 % (v/v). 

Determination of K, Na, Mg, Ca, Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn, Cr, Ni, Cd and Pb was performed by 

flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) in a spectrometer model Spectr AA-20 

with deuterium background correction (Varian Australia, Mulgrave, Victoria, 

Australia).  

 Phosphorus was determined spectrophotometrically according to an ISO standard 

(1996), in an UNICAM UV 5 220 spectrophotometer (ATI UNICAM, Cambridge, UK). 

Samples (5 g) were incinerated and dissolved in HCl (20 % w/v). Colorimetric 

measurements of the absorbance of a yellow compound from the reaction of P with a 

mixture of ammonium vanadate and ammonium molybdate were performed.  

Total mercury (Hg) was determined by cold vapour atomic absorption spectrometry 

(CVAAS) using Coleman model MAS-50D mercury analyser system (Bacharach, Inc., 

Pittsburgh, USA). Of each specimen, 1 g of homogenised muscle tissue was digested 

with concentrated sulphuric acid. Then, Hg in the sample (Hg
0
 and Hg

+2

2
) was oxidised, 

with potassium permanganate 5 % (w/v), to Hg
2+

. After reducing the Hg
2+ 

to Hg
0
 with 



stannous chloride 20 % (w/v), the volatile Hg
0
 was bubbled into the closed system of 

the MAS 50D analyser (?=253.7 nm). The method used was developed by Hatch and 

Ott (1968) and described in detail by Joiris et al. (1991). 

All analyses were carried out in duplicate, using the external calibration method. 

Detection limits (calculated by residual standard deviation from linear regression) (DL, 

mg kg
-1

, wet wt) were 0.01 (K), 0.09 (Na), 0.01 (P), 0.02 (Mg), 0.08 (Ca), 0.06 (Zn), 

0.32 (Fe), 0.02 (Cu), 0.01 (Mn), 0.02 (Ni), 0.09 (Cr), 0.01 (Cd), 0.02 (Pb) and 0.01 for 

Hg. 

All laboratory ware was cleaned with HNO3 (10 %) or HCl (20 %) for 24-48 h and 

rinsed with ultra pure water (18.2 M?cm). All chemical were reagent grade. 

Commercial standard solutions (1000 mg L
-1

) for all elements were used (Merck). 

Analytical data for elements are reported as g kg 
–1 

or mg kg
-1

 on a wet weight basis.  

Four certified reference materials were tested in the same conditions as the samples, 

in order to assess analytical method accuracy: LUTS-1 (Non defatted lobster 

hepatopancreas), TORT-2 (Lobster hepatopancreas), DORM-2 (Dogfish muscle) from 

National Research Council of Canada and SMRD-2000 (Canned matrix meat) from 

Swedish Meats R &amp;amp; D and Scan Foods/ National Food Administration. The determined 

values for all elements were in good agreement with the certified values (Table 2). 

2.3 Statistical analysis 

To test the normality and the homogeneity of variance of data, the Kolmogrov-

Smirnov’s test and Levene’s F-test, were used, respectively. Data, which corroborate 

these assumptions, were analysed by the ANOVA distribution to determine the 

difference between the mineral levels in muscle tissue sampled from farmed fish. When 

those conditions were not verified, data were tested non-parametrically with Mann-



Whitney’s U-test. Statistical significance was considered when p&lt;0.05. All data analysis 

was performed using STATISTICA (Statsoft, Inc. USA, 2000). 

 

3. Results and discussion 

Proximate composition for the four studied fish is reported in Table 3. Data relative 

to macro and trace/ultra trace elements are presented in Tables 4 and 5, respectively. 

Similar patterns were observed for these two groups of elements for the four farmed fish 

species, suggesting that each element may have the same physiological importance for 

all organisms. In general terms, the lowest element concentrations were found in P. 

maxima. The main elements were K, Na, P, Mg and Ca, followed by Zn, Fe, Cu, Cr, Mn 

and Ni. Each group will be discussed separately. Considering the elemental 

concentrations found in the present work, DRI percentages for each element, in a 160 g 

portion (a per capita fish consumption of 57.1 kg, which represents ? 160 g fish person-

1
 day

-1
 (FAO,2007) are calculated. Histograms are shown in Figures 1 and 2, in order to 

compare DRI percentages in the four farmed fish species. Total concentrations of Hg, 

Pb and Cd, metals considered toxic and regulated by the EU Commission (EU, 2006, 

2008), are summarised in Table 6. 

 

3.1 Proximate composition 

The results obtained for proximate composition were similar to those reported by 

several authors (Alasalvar et al., 2002; Erkan and Özden, 2007; Huidobro et al., 2001; 

Testi et al., 2006). Average moisture content ranged between 67.4 and 75.3 g (100 g)
-1

, 

for D. labrax and O. mykiss, respectively. As expected, fat content was inversely 

proportional to moisture content and the highest value was found in D. labrax (13.1 g 

(100 g)
-1

). The different fat levels are probably due to the dietary history of each fish 



species. All study farmed fish presented a high protein level, around 20 g (100 g)
-1

, 

which is in accordance with Belitz (2004). Ash content was superior to 1 g (100 g)
-1

 in 

all samples, reaching 1.40 g (100 g)
-1

 in S. aurata. The lowest level was found in 

P.maxima, however the value is in accordance with the results reported by some authors 

(Busetto et al., 2008; Özogul et al., 2006).  

 

3.2. Macro elements (K, P, Na, Mg, Ca) 

These elements are considered essential and their main functions include skeletal 

structure, maintenance of colloidal system and regulation of acid-base equilibrium. 

Potassium was the most abundant element in the four studied fish species; the minimum 

value was obtained for P. maxima, about 3.0 g kg
-1

 and the largest concentration was 

found in D. labrax (5.7 g kg
-1

). No significant differences were found between levels of 

K in D. labrax and O. mykiss. S. aurata showed an intermediate level, around 4.7 g kg
-1

. 

These values are similar to those reported by Orban et al. (2000) and Erkan et al. (2007) 

in D. puntazzo, D. labrax and S. aurata, respectively. The second most abundant 

element in the studied fish species was P. No significant differences were found for the 

values of P, among the fish species, with the exception of P. maxima that presented the 

lowest value (1.8 g kg
-1

). The mean contents were situated between 2.5 and 2.7 g kg
-1

 

for D. labrax, S. aurata and O. mykiss. These values are in agreement with the statement 

of Oehlenschläger (1997) that the P content in marine fish muscle is on average close to 

2 g kg
-1

. One study of Vlieg et al. (1991) also revealed values around 2.5 g kg
-1

 for trout 

species (Salmo trutta and Oncorhynchus mykiss). Nevertheless, the levels obtained in 

the present study were lower than those reported by other authors (Erkan et al., 2007; 

Fuentes et al., 2010; Gokoglu et al., 2004) for the same species. In the main elemental 

profile observed for the studied farmed fish species, Na was the third element. As 



confirmed by Oehlenschläger (1997) the levels of Na were lower than K ones. The 

concentrations of Na found in this study were around 1.0 g kg
-1

. Sodium levels of D. 

labrax and O. mykiss did not show significant differences. Other studies showed lower 

levels of Na when compared with the present work in D. labrax, S. aurata (Erkan et al., 

2007), and O. mykiss (Gokoglu et al., 2004). However, similar contents were reported 

by Martinez-Valverde et al. (2000) for blue whiting, hake and sole. Magnesium and Ca 

were the last macro elements found in the elemental profile, being Mg concentrations 

higher than Ca ones. This fact is in accordance to Oehlenschläger (1997), that, in 

general, fish contains more Mg than Ca. No significant differences were observed 

between values of these two elements in D. labrax and O. mykiss (approximately 0.37 g 

kg
-1 

and 0.30 g kg
-1

, respectively). S. aurata showed intermediate levels, but Ca 

concentrations were also not significantly different from the values of the other two 

species referred above. As with the other macro elements, P. maxima showed the lowest 

amounts of these two metals, 0.24 g kg
-1

 for Mg and 0.11 g kg
-1

 for Ca. Values obtained 

for Mg were expected, but for Ca they were low when compared with previous research 

for the same species (Aubourg et al., 2007; Erkan et a., 2007; Gokoglu et al., 2004) or 

different ones (Martinez-Valverde et al., 2000). Nevertheless, Fuentes et al. (2010) 

observed Mg levels lower than those obtained in the present study. The differences 

found among data reported by several authors could be attributed to a variety of factors 

including availability and type of food, dietary ingredients and reduced activity of the 

cultured fish. 

 

3.3 Trace and ultra trace elements (Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn, Cr, Ni) 

In general, these essential elements are important components of hormones, enzymes 

and enzyme activators. They are associated with specific proteins in metalloenzymes, 

which produce a unique catalytic function. Zinc, Fe and Cu were the elements 



presenting the highest values of this group, being Zn the most abundant. P. maxima 

showed the highest average content of Zn (6.8 mg kg
-1

) and S. aurata the lowest 

average value (4.9 mg kg
-1

); these concentrations were statistically different. No 

significant differences for Zn levels were observed among D. labrax, O. mykiss and S. 

aurata, however Zn level in O. mykiss was also not different from P. maxima one. In 

literature, different Zn concentrations in seafood can be found. Some studies performed 

in farmed fish indicated lower levels than those observed in the present work (Dugo et 

al., 2006; Erkan et al., 2007; Fuentes et al., 2010) and other studies revealed higher Zn 

levels when compared to the levels found in this study (Alasalvar et al., 2002; Gokoglu 

et al., 2004). On the other hand, compared with studies on farmed and wild P. maxima 

(Aubourg et al., 2006), wild trout (Scherz and Kirchhoff, 2006; Vlieg et al., 1991), and 

wild S. aurata (Canli and Atli, 2003; Türkmen et al., 2008), the results of the present 

work were similar. For example, in a study performed on fish species from Northeast 

Atlantic (Celik and Oehlenschläger, 2004), the Zn content ranged from 2.1 mg kg
-1

 to 

8.7 mg kg
-1

. This shows that Zn concentrations in fish species are variable and it is not 

possible to establish a small range of values. Iron levels were around 5 mg kg
-1

 for D. 

labrax and S. aurata. Differently from the Zn profile, the lowest Fe content was found 

in P. maxima (2.6 mg kg
-1

). The average Fe values found in O. mykiss and S. aurata 

were not statistically different from the other two species. The lowest Fe content found 

in P maxima can be explained by the low percentage of dark flesh in this fish. In 1995, 

Lall (1995) collect several Fe data, showing a wide range of values in many marine fish 

and crustaceans (0.8 to 373 mg kg
-1

). The author explained that this wide range would 

be probably due to metal and bone contamination of fishery products and differences in 

analytical methodology. In fact, according to Oehlenschläger (1997), Fe is present in 

concentrations of approximately 5.0 mg kg
-1

 in marine fish species. Therefore, levels 



found in the present study were in the range found by Oehlenschläger (1997) and other 

authors (Aubourg et al., 2007; Canli and Atli, 2003; Dural et al., 2007; Fuentes et al., 

2010; Gokoglu et al., 2004; Türkmen et al., 2005), for similar fish species. Nevertheless, 

some authors reported higher levels than those of the present study (Alasalvar et al., 

2002; Erkan et al., 2007; Türkmen et al., 2008; Uluozlu et al., 2007; Vlieg et al., 1991). 

Copper was the third element in the profile of trace elements, except for P. maxima. 

Significant differences were found when comparing the lowest Cu average level, 0.17 

mg kg
-1

, found in P maxima, and the highest one, 0.71 mg kg
-1

, found in S. aurata, D. 

labrax and O. mykiss showed intermediate levels, approximately 0.45 mg kg
-1

, being the 

average value, found in D. labrax, not statistically different from the average values 

found in S. aurata and O. mykiss. In literature, some comparative studies between wild 

and farmed fish showed that, in general wild fish present a lower Cu content than 

farmed fish (Alam et al, 2002; Alasalvar et al., 2002; Aubourg et al., 2007; Ikem and 

Egilla, 2008). These different contents can be attributed to the different type of food in 

wild marine environment and farm systems. In fact, Cu levels reported in the present 

study were higher than those verified by other authors, for the wild fish species (Canli 

and Atli, 2003; Dural et al., 2007; Fuentes et al., 2010; Gokoglu et al., 2004; Türkmen 

et al., 2005; Uuozlu et al., 2007). 

 The three studied essential ultra trace elements were Mn, Cr and Ni. Significant 

differences were detected between Mn levels in two of the study fish species: S. aurata 

showed the lowest average value (0.14 mg kg
-1

) and P. maxima the highest one (0.32 

mg kg
-1

). The differences in the Mn contents of D. labrax and O. mykiss were found to 

be non-significant. Statistically, and regarding Mn values, D. labrax and P. maxima as 

well as O. mykiss and S. aurata were identical. Manganese levels found in the present 

study were low and inferior to other values reported by some authors for similar farmed 



fish species (Alasalvar et al., 2002; Erkan et al., 2007; Gokoglu et al., 2004). Studies 

performed by Aubourg et al. (2007) in farmed P. maxima, Türkmen et al. (2005) in wild 

S.aurata and Vlieg et al. (1991) in wild O.mykiss, showed Mn levels comparable to 

those found in the present work. In contrast, Mn levels in farmed D. labrax from Greece 

and Spain were lower than the values reported by the present study (Fuentes et al., 

2010). The levels of Cr were approximately about 0.30 mg kg
-1

. No significant 

differences were found among the Cr contents of the four studied fish species. In 

literature, it is possible to find a wide range of Cr levels in fish species, partially due to 

environmental pollution. For example, the study performed by Garg and Krishna 

(2006), in fish from Indian coastal areas, showed values between 0.06 and 29.9 mg kg
-1

. 

In fact, results reported in the present work were similar to those reported by some 

authors in S. aurata and D. labrax from Mediterrean and Aegean seas (Canli and Atli, 

2003; Türkmen et al., 2005, 2009; Uluozlu et al., 2007), but lower or higher than those 

found by others (Ikem and Egilla, 2008; Türkmen et al., 2008; Tuzen., 2009 or Alam et 

al., 2002; Alasalvar et al., 2002; Ersoy et al., 2006). Nickel was the ultra trace element 

that showed the lowest values of the group (between 0.02 and 0.04 mg kg
-1

). As for Cr, 

no significant differences among Ni contents were detected for all studied fish species. 

Studies on Ni levels in farmed fish species similar to those studied in the present work 

are scarce. One study performed by Alasalvar et al. (2002) showed higher Ni 

concentrations in D. labrax than observed in our study. In general, values found in the 

present study were lower than those reported by others in wild fish species (Türkmen et 

al., 2005, 2008, 2009; Tuzen, 2009; Uluozlu et al., 2007). These differences are 

probably due to the environmental pollution affecting the catch areas. Only two studies, 

one performed in farmed and wild Cyprinus carpio from Lake Kasumigaura, Japan 



(Alam et al., 2002) and other performed in wild D. labrax from Ria de Aveiro, Portugal 

(Pérez Cid et al., 2001) showed low Ni values, as in the present study. 

 

3.4 Toxic elements (Cd, Hg, Pb) 

Cadmium, Hg and Pb do not show any essential function in human life and are 

considered harmful. In addition, their connection with several diseases is well known. 

Mercury in its several forms is regarded as neurotoxic, Pb affects the central nervous 

system and Cd has a deleterious effect upon the kidneys. 

The mean values of Cd were quite low, around 0.01 mg kg
-1

. Nevertheless, 

significant differences were observed among the Cd levels for four studied fish species. 

In fact, Cd concentrations in D. labrax, were different from those of the other three fish 

species, and those of S. aurata were not different of Cd levels found in P. maxima and 

O. mykiss. There were no significant differences among Pb contents of the four studied 

fish species. The mean values situated between 0.02 and 0.05 mg kg
-1

. The values 

obtained for these two metals in the present work are in accordance to those reported by 

some studies in farmed fish species (Alam et al., 2002; Ersoy et al., 2006; Fernandes et 

al., 2008; Ferreira et al., 2008). Nevertheless, D. labrax from two Sicilian farms (Dugo 

et al., 2006) and one Greek farm (Alasalvar et al., 2002) showed higher levels than Cd 

and Pb concentrations found in this study. In general, wild fish showed higher Pb and 

Cd contents than farmed ones (Canli and Atli, 2003; Dural et al., 2007; Türkmen et al., 

2005, 2008, 2009; Tuzen, 2009; Uluozlu et al., 2007). Mercury was the toxic metal that 

showed the highest levels of this elemental group. The minimum was observed in S. 

aurata (0.04 mg kg
-1

) and the maximum was attained in D. labrax (0.21 mg kg
-1

), 

although the mean levels in these two fish species were not statistically different. The 

mean concentrations presented by O. mykiss and P. maxima were similar. Due to 



intrinsic and extrinsic factors, very different Hg concentrations in seafood can be 

observed. In farmed fish, feeds are supposed to be the main source of Hg. Literature 

reporting Hg levels for these four studied fish species is scarce. Some studies performed 

in other farmed fish species showed similar or lower Hg values than those determined in 

the present work (Dewailly et al., 2007; Easton et al., 2002; Ikem and Egilla, 2008; 

Ureña et al., 2007). Tuzen (2009) reported a similar Hg content for P. maximma (45 µg 

kg
-1

). On the other hand, studies on farmed tuna species revealed higher values than 

those observed by the present work (Padula et al., 2008; Vizzini et al., 2010). The mean 

values of Cd, Pb and Hg, observed in the four studied fish species did not surpass the 

established limits (Cd: 0.05 mg kg
-1

, Pb: 0.30 mg kg
-1

, Hg: 0.50 or 1.0 mg kg
-1

) by EU 

(EU, 2006, 2008). 

 

3.5. Dietary reference and provisional tolerable weekly element intakes 

Since farmed fish are now a significant diet source in south European countries, 

intake of macro, trace and ultra trace elements is of utmost important. Taking into 

consideration the proposed levels for DRI by Institute of Medicine of the National 

Academies of USA (IOM) (2005), the contribution of each studied element to the DRI 

for the four fish species was calculated (Figure 1 - macro elements and Figure 2 - trace 

and ultra trace elements). Results show that studied farmed fish are a good source of P, 

contributing to more than 40 - 50 % of the DRI. These fish may also significantly 

contribute to the DRI of K, Mg and Na, representing 9 – 19 % of the DRI. The Na/K 

ratio is inferior to 1 which indicates a low risk of developing high blood pressure and 

cardiovascular disease (Astorga España et al., 2007). Of the various macro elements 

studied, Ca is the element that shows the lowest percentage contribution for DRI, which 

is in agreement with the fact that fish, is considered a poor source of Ca (Lall, 1995). 



The contributions for DRI of Zn, Fe and Cu are also important. Moreover, Mn and Ni 

percentages are small, ranging between 1 and 3 %. In all studied fish species, Cr 

concentrations are above the DRI (data not show in histogram). Until now, no tolerable 

upper intake level (UL) was set for Cr. However, according to Council for Responsible 

Nutrition (CRN) (Hathcock, 2004) Cr supplements at levels up to 1,000 µg per day are 

regarded as safe for adults. This intake is above the results found in this study (0.04 – 

0.05 mg Cr in a 160 g portion). In general, P. maxima showed the lowest contents of 

most elements and obviously their contribution for DRI was lower than that of the other 

three species. 

A joint committee of Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization 

(FAO/WHO) (WHO, 1999, 2003) established provisional tolerable weekly intakes 

(PTWI) for Cd (7 µg kg-1 body weight), Hg (5 µg kg-1 body weight) and Pb (25 µg kg-1 

body weight). Considering a weekly average consumption of seafood products in 

Portugal of 1120 g (160 g / day) (FAO, 2007), an average human body weight of 60 kg 

and the average Cd, Hg and Pb concentrations observed in this study (Table 6), 

estimated weekly intakes of the three metals were calculated. The values found for Cd 

(? 0.2 µg kg-1 body weight), Hg (1.1 – 2.6 µg kg-1 body weight) and Pb (0.4 – 0.9 µg kg-

1
 body weight) are lower than established PTWIs. 

 

4. Conclusions 

This study revealed that consumption of farmed D. labrax, S. aurata, O. mykiss and 

P. maxima does not pose a health risk problem to Portuguese from estimated dietary 

intakes of toxic elements. In addition, they are a good source of essential elements, 

contributing for the DRI, especially regarding P, K, Mg and Zn. Nevertheless, P. 

maxima contribution for elemental DRI is minor in comparison to the other three 



species. This study supports the importance of promoting consumption of fish, and in 

this context, farmed fish and will also contribute to the Portuguese food composition 

database.

Abstract

BACKGROUND: Mercury is a well-known toxic element present in seafood. Nevertheless some antioxidants, like
selenium, as an integral component of the enzyme glutathione peroxidase, and ?-tocopherol having a protective
role against it, are present as well. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the levels of total mercury (HgT),
organic mercury (HgOrg), Se and ?-tocopherol in some adult deep-water fish species caught off Portuguese waters.

RESULTS: Levels of HgT were above EU limits in 6% of Lophius spp. and Aphanopus carbo, 2% of Lepidorhombus
spp. and 70% of Helicolenus dactylopterus. HgOrg represented the major fraction (more than 84%) of HgT in all
studied muscles. The selenium concentration in muscle was similar in all species (about 0.4 mg kg?1 wet weight)
and the highest level of ?-tocopherol (70 mg kg?1 wet weight) was found in Aphanopus carbo.

CONCLUSION: The muscle of all species studied is a good source of selenium, but only can give a small
contribution of ?-tocopherol. Attending to the provisional tolerable weekly intake established by the WHO/FAO
for methylmercury, it appears that the species studied should be consumed sparingly.

INTRODUCTION
There is a much concern about the amount and
quality of the nutrients that are supplied by the diet
to maintain human health and well-being.1 Although
seafood products are well known for their contribution
to health, there are several types of toxic substance
from natural and/or anthropogenic origins that can
contaminate them.2

Contaminant metals, such as mercury, do not
show any essential function in life and, because of
their toxicity, are considered harmful elements. These
metals can be toxic for humans, even at very low
concentrations.3 They can be assimilated, stored and
concentrated by organisms, through the food chain,
resulting in physiological damage.4,5

Regarding these toxic metal ions, most of the
chemical reactions that explain their toxicity at
cellular level involve electron transfer, formation of
free radicals and their influence on DNA, with
possible consequences in mutagenicity, genotoxicity
and carcinogenicity.6 Mercury is a contaminant metal
that is naturally present in the environment. This
contaminant is present at low level in water systems,

but bioconcentrates in the aquatic food chain, reaching
its highest level in large and old predatory fish and
marine mammals. Organic mercury (HgOrg) is found
mainly in fish as methylmercury. The exposure to
mercury, especially to organic mercury, results in
neurological and renal damage and has potentially
harmful effects on cardiovascular diseases as well.7

Almost all elements considered to be essential can
be found in different levels in edible parts of marine
fish, supplying macro and trace elements to the
human diet.1 In addition, there is growing evidence
that micronutrient intake has a significant effect on
the toxicity and carcinogenesis caused by various
chemicals. Micronutrients can affect the toxicity of
metals by interacting with them at several points in
the body: absorption and excretion, transport, binding
to target proteins, metabolism and sequestration of
toxic metals and in secondary mechanisms of toxicity.8

Consequently, if the human diet is deficient in
micronutrients it is possible to predispose to toxicity
from non-essential metals. Seafood has received
attention as a possible modifier of methylmercury
distribution in a way that protects organisms exposed

to this form of mercury through the consumption
of marine products.9 Selenium is a required dietary
element for health, but it can be toxic at high
concentrations. It is an integral component of the
enzyme glutathione peroxidase, which, together with
vitamin E and catalase and superoxide dismutase
enzymes, acts as an antioxidant, thereby protecting
cells against oxidative damage.10,11 Several studies
have shown that antioxidants like selenium offer
some protection against methylmercury and inorganic
mercury,8,9 thus selenium deficiently accentuates the
toxicity caused by heavy metals.10 Fish fat and liver
are significant sources of fat-soluble vitamins, A and
D. Also present are vitamins E (tocopherol) and K.11

Vitamin E is an antioxidant and prevents free radical
injury caused by methylmercury.8

Vitamins are organic compounds that are indis-
pensable in very small amounts in the diet. They
form a heterogeneous group of substances and are
vital nutrients. Some have specific and individual
functions to promote growth or reproduction, or to
maintain health and life.12 ?-Tocopherol has the high-
est biological activity among the different forms of
vitamin E. Since ?-tocopherol is the major form
detected in marine animal tissue, vitamin E values
most likely parallel ?-tocopherol values. In biologi-
cal systems, vitamin E functions as an antioxidant
to protect cellular lipid components by donation of
the phenolic hydrogen to a free radical, thus inhibit-
ing the chain reaction of free radical propagation.13

In addition, the in vitro, cellular and animal studies,
which are impressive both in quantity and quality,
leave no doubt that vitamin E, the most impor-
tant fat-soluble antioxidant, protects animals against
various types of oxidative stress.14 Furthermore, dif-
ferent antioxidants seem to act synergistically, sele-
nium can enhance tocopherol activity and it appears
that the protective role of these two antioxidants
is cumulative,10,11 so supplementation with vitamin
E might be more effective if combined with other
micronutrients.14

The main objective of this work was to evaluate
the levels of total and organic mercury and some
antioxidants in tissues of some deep-water fish species
caught off the Portuguese coast and to establish
suitable relationships between the animal length
and weight and accumulation of these elements. In
addition, the comparison of results obtained with
maximum levels fixed by a European Commission
regulation15 and with the provisional tolerable weekly
intake (PTWI) recommended by the Joint FAO/WHO
Expert Committee on Food additives16,17 and the
comparison of antioxidant content in the muscle
and their daily intake requirements were a second
goal.

EXPERIMENTAL
Sample collection and preparation
For this experiment fish samples were collected
between 2004 and 2006. The species Lophius

spp. (Lophius piscatorius and L. budegassa, angler
and black-bellied angler, respectively) (n = 33) and
Helicolenus dactylopterus (blackbelly rosefish) (n =
50) were obtained during several bottom trawl
research surveys carried out by the Portuguese
Institute for Marine Research (INRB-IP/IPIMAR)
along the Portuguese coast. Aphanopus carbo (black
scabbardfish) (n = 50) were caught off Sesimbra
and Lepidorhombus spp (Lepidorhombus boscii and
L. whiffiagonis, fourspotted megrim and megrim)
(n = 53) in the Peniche area. Total length (cm),
weight (g) and the sex of all fish were recorded.
Muscle of all fish samples and liver of Lophius spp.
and Aphanopus carbo were removed and stored at
?30 ?C for further analyses. For organic mercury
and selenium determination, fish samples were
freeze dried for 48 h at ?45 ?C and low pressure
(approximately 10?1 atm). Samples were powdered
and stored under controlled moisture conditions until
further analysis.

Sample analysis
Total and organic mercury (HgT and Hgorg) were
determined by atomic absortion spectrometry using
an automatic Hg analyser (Leco apparatus AMA 254,
St. Joseph, MI, USA). Hgorg was extracted from
samples using the method described by Scerbo and
Barghigiani.18 An aliquot of the lyophilised sample
(0.2 – 2 g) was hydrolysed with hydrobromic acid (47%
w/w) and then the Hgorg species were extracted
from the sample with toluene. Finally, a cysteine
solution was added to remove the organic mercury
compounds from the toluene. Approximately 100 mg
of wet tissue (for total Hg) or 100 µL of cysteine
extract (for Hgorg) was transferred to a sample boat,
which was placed in a decomposition tube where
it was dried and then thermally decomposed by
controlled heating. The final decomposition products
pass thought a mercury amalgamator which collects
Hg0. The mercury amalgamator is heated to 700 ?C
and the mercury is released and detected at 254 nm
by absorption spectrometry. An external calibration
curve was made with standard solutions prepared
by dilution from a 1000 mg l?1 mercuric nitrate
standard solution (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).
The mercury concentration was within the range
5 – 400 µg L?1.

The energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spec-
trometer (EDXRF) used in this work to quantify
selenium consists of an X-ray tube (Philips, PW
1140; 100 kV, 80 mA; Eindhoven, The Netherlands)
equipped with a changeable secondary target, in
molybdenum. The characteristic radiation emitted by
the elements present in the sample was detected by
a Si(Li) detector (Oxford, High Wycombe, United
Kingdom), with a 30 mm2 active area and 8 µm beryl-
lium window. The energy resolution was 135 eV at
5.9 keV and the acquisition system was a Nucleus
PCA card (High Wycombe, United Kingdom). Quan-
titative calculations were made by the fundamental

parameters method,19,20 which makes use of the
fundamental parameters such as cross-sections for
absorption and X-ray production, transition inten-
sities, fluorescence yields, for example. The relation
between the measured peak intensity (Ii ) and the con-
centration of an element Ci is given by the relation
Ii = I0mKi Ci Ai , where I0 is the intensity of the X-ray
beam, m is the sample thickness (g cm?2), K is an
experimental calibration factor which depends on the
spectrometer geometry, detector efficiency, detector
solid angle and cross-sections for producing charac-
teristic X-rays, and together with I0 is obtained by
analysis of standard reference samples. The standard
reference materials used were similar to the samples
studied: TORT-2, lobster hepatopancreas reference
material; DORM-2, dogfish muscle certified reference
material, both from National Research Council (NRC-
CNRC), Canada, and freeze dried animal blood from
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA-A-13),
Austria.

Ai is the self-attenuation factor which can be
obtained iteratively, considering that 80% of the
matrix elements consist on H, C and O.

The peak shape and background are described by a
mathematical Gaussian function. At the low-energy
side of the peak, this function is replaced by an
exponential function. The basic idea of the fitting
procedure is to find a set of parameter values which
minimise the chi-square value.

The X-ray generator was operated at 50 kV and
20 mA and a typical acquisition time of 1000 s was
used. The sample powder was pressed into pellets
2.0 cm in diameter without any chemical treatment.
Pellets were then glued onto Mylar film, on a sample
holder, and placed directly in the X-ray beam, for
determination of elements.

Analysis of ?-tocopherol was carried out after lipid
extraction following the Bligh and Dyer method.21

Tocopherols were determined by normal phase high-
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) follow-
ing the method described by Piironen et al.22 with
minor modifications. Total lipids were dissolved in

hexane in the concentration of 36 mg lipid mL?1

and 20 µL were injected in the HPLC (Jasco model
PU-980; Tokyo, Japan), equipped with an auto-
matic injector Jasco (model AS-950-10), and a flu-
orescence detector (Jasco model FP-1520) (exci-
tation wavelength = 292 nm, emission wavelength =
324 nm), the mobile phase was degassed (Gastor
model GT-104; Tokyo, Japan). The column was a
Lichrosorb Si 60-5 (250 mm × 3 mm i.d.; Chrompack,
Walnut Creek, CA), protected with a guard column
(S2)-SS (10 mm × 2 mm i.d., Chrompack). The iso-
cratic mobile phase contained 7 mL L?1 of isopropanol
in n-hexane, with a flow rate of 0.5 mL min?1. The
retention time for the identification of ?-tocopherol
was determined by injection of an ?-tocopherol stan-
dard. Tocopherols concentration was obtained using
the peak integration area of Borwin software 1.2 ver-
sion (Tokyo, Japan).

An external calibration curve was made with
standard solutions prepared by dilution from a 95%
?-tocopherol standard solution (Sigma, St Louis, MO,
USA). The range of ?-tocopherol concentration was
within 1 – 200 µg mL?1.

A minimum of two replicate analyses was performed
for each sample and each element analysed. All
standards and reagents were of the highest purity.
To quantify HgT and HgOrg, and ?-tocopherol in
the sample a calibration curve was made with no
fewer than five standards in different concentrations.
The moisture was determined by the sample drying
technique at 105 ?C23 to convert the results of HgOrg
and Se on a wet weight base. Data for ?-tocopherol
were transformed to mg kg?1 wet weight taking into
account the level of extract oil from the samples by
gram of fresh tissue.

Accuracy was checked by analysis of several certified
reference materials (Table 1). From these results it
can be concluded that the analysed material was in the
range values of the certified material. The detection
limits were 0.5 µg g?1 (total and organic mercury),
0.6 mg kg?1 dry weight (Se) and 2.59 µg mL?1 (?-
tocopherol).

Statistical analysis
To test the normality and the homogeneity of variance
of data, the Kolmogrov – Smirnov test and Levene’s
F-test, respectively, were used. Data that corroborate
these assumptions were analysed by Student’s t
distribution to determine the difference between sex
and all measured parameters (length, weight, total Hg,
organic Hg, Se and ?-tocopherol). Data that do not
assume the normality or homogeneity of variance were
log transformed. When the conditions of the Student’s
t distribuition were not verified, data were tested
nonparametrically with the Mann – Whitney U -test.
The Pearson coefficient was calculated to determine
the correlation between the obtained values. For all
statistical tests the significance level (?) was 0.05. All
data analysis was performed using STATISTICA 6
(2003 version) (Stat-sof, Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A total of 186 fish from the North Atlantic Ocean
(Portuguese mainland) were examined in this study
(Table 2). All fish sampled were adults and their
sizes were within the commercial range. Contrary to
the behaviour in Aphanopus carbo and Lepidorhombus
spp., Lophius species and Helicolenus dactylopterus
showed significant differences between males and
females either with length or weight (P &amp;lt;0.05).
In all fish species studied a significantly positive
correlation between length and weight (P &amp;lt;0.001)
was verified. The correlation coefficients obtained
were: r = 0.9651 for Lophius spp.; r = 0.9517 for
Helicolenus dactylopterus; r = 0.7923 for Aphanopus
carbo; and r = 0.9806 for Lepidorhombus spp.

Levels of total and organic mercury, selenium and
?-tocopherol and the corresponding mean, standard
deviations, median, range measured in muscle and
liver tissues are summarised in Table 3.

Considering all fish species, the range of HgT
in the muscle and liver tissue were, respectively,
0.06 – 1.75 and 0.04 – 3.96 mg kg?1 wet weight. The
HgT content, either in muscle or liver tissue, was not
different (P &gt; 0.05) between males and females for
every species studied. This fact was also noted by
Monteiro et al.24 for Helicolenus dactylopterus caught in
the sea around the Azores.

Helicolenus dactylopterus HgT mean values registered
in the present work (mean: 0.66 ± 0.26 mg kg?1 wet
weight) are higher than those reported by Andersen
and Depledge25 (mean: 0.260 mg kg?1 wet weight)
and Monteiro et al.24 (mean: 0.29 ± 0.025 mg kg?1
wet weight) for the same species caught in the Azores
area. However, this different mean level may be due
not only to the geographic capture zone, but also
to the range size of the specimens analysed in these
works (range size: 13.8 – 29.6 cm noted by Andersen
and Depledge,25 11.2 – 47.2 cm noted by Monteiro
et al.24 and 21.2 – 36.0 cm in the present work). It
is recognised that, in fish, mercury usually increases
with body size and/or age, so larger and/or older
fish generally have higher concentrations than do
smaller or younger fish. For Helicolenus dactylopterus,
a significant positive correlation (P &amp;lt;0.05) with
HgT in the muscle tissue and both length and
weight was found (Table 4). This finding has also
been verified by other authors.24,25 According to
the Von Bertalanffy growth model for combined
sexes of Helicolenus dactylopterus, found by Monteiro
et al.,24 the sampled fish used in the present study
was between 5 and 20 years old. In addition, the
same work reported that, during the first 20 years
of age, the period of exponential growth, there
is a significant increase in the mass of mercury
accumulated each year in the muscle tissue. After
age 20, the inflection and decrease in growth rate is
accompanied by an exponential increase in mercury
accumulation. The same author24 also verified that
after age 20 the annual increase in mercury is
approximately constant. It was also revealed that
higher levels of mercury, when compared with that
in other species, could be due to its slower growth
and greater longevity, resulting in longer exposure to
contamination.

The mean percentage of HgOrg in the muscle
of Helicolenus dactylopterus was 86 ± 6%. Similar
mean percentage (85.9%) for the same tissue
and fish species was obtained by Andersen and
Deplege.25

Aphanopus carbo is a deep-water species, living
up to a maximum of 12 years26 and is considered
a large carnivorous predator.27 The mean total
mercury concentration in the muscle for this species
(0.63 ± 0.27 mg kg?1 wet weight) was lower than the
values reported by other authors. The study by Afonso
et al.28 exhibited mean levels near 0.9 mg kg?1 wet
weight in Aphanopus carbo caught off both Madeira and
the Azores archipelagos. Nevertheless, in that study
the maximum level found in the areas of sampling
was lower (around 1.4 mg kg?1 wet weight) when
compared with the specimens sampled in Sesimbra
(off the Portuguese mainland) of the present study
(maximum was 1.75 mg kg?1 wet weight). Renzoni
et al.29 reported a HgT maximum concentration in
Aphanopus carbo caught in the Madeira archipelago,
near to those verified in the present study (1.8 mg kg?1

wet weight). In the liver of Aphanopus carbo the

HgT mean content was 1.31 ± 0.88 mg kg?1 wet
weight with a maximum of 3.96 mg kg?1 wet weight.
In accord with the studies by Afonso et al.28 and
Bebianno et al.,30 these levels indicate that mercury
accumulation is greater in liver than in muscle
(liver:muscle ratio &gt; 1). This fact can be explained

by uncontaminated fish that recently migrated into a
mercury-polluted area.31 Nevertheless, the percentage
of HgOrg was lower in the liver (34 ± 7%) than in the
muscle (86 ± 5%). Riisga?rd and Hansen,31 in a study

concentrations of organic and inorganic mercury and
found that organic mercury is rapidly incorporated
in blood and accumulated in the muscle tissue.
Much less inorganic mercury is accumulated in blood
or muscle but retained in the liver and eventually
excreted via liver bile. The same work also supports
the notion that organic mercury is biotransformed to
inorganic mercury in the liver. This fact probably
explains the low level of organic mercury in the
liver when compared to the amount of inorganic
mercury. In the present study and taking into account
the age – length relationships found by Morales-Nin
et al.,26 Aphanopus carbo was between 4 and 10 years.
In contrast to the studies by Afonso et al.28 and
Renzoni et al.,29 the present Aphanopus carbo showed
a significant positive correlation for the level of
HgT in muscle, either with length or weight, and
in liver tissue, with weight. Bebianno et al.30 noted
that total mercury increased exponentially with size
(total length, cm) in the muscle and liver and the
pattern of mercury was similar between tissues. A
positive correlation between both mercury levels in
the muscle and liver was also verified (r = 0.592,
P &amp;lt;0.0001).

Lophius species are voracious predators that feed
on a wide variety of small and juvenile fish32 and
can live up to age 20.33 By referring to the results
obtained by Landa et al.33 in a study concerning the
growth of Lophius piscatorius and L. budegassa, the
fish used in the present work was more than 4 years
of age. Lepidorhombus is a visual day feeder, which
feeds on prey such as fish that move quickly, although
the smaller specimens are more dependent on smaller
prey such as crustaceans.34 Both Lepidorhombus boscii35

and L. whiffiagonis36 live up age 10. Storelli and
Marcotrigiano32 identified the concentrations of total
mercury in Lophius piscatorius and L. budegassa and
in Lepidorhombus boscii. Such concentrations showed a
higher maximum in the Lophius species (2.22 mg kg?1

wet weight for L. piscatorius and 1.62 mg kg?1 wet
weight for L. budegassa) and a lower maximum in
Lepidorhombus boscii (0.92 mg kg?1 wet weight) when
compared to the maximum level obtained in the
present work (1.51 mg kg?1 wet weight for Lophius
spp. and 1.22 mg kg?1 wet weight for Lepidorhombus
spp.). This difference may be due to the different
geographical zone (the samples were from the southern
Adriatic sea along the Apulian coast) and in the
case of Lepidorhombus boscii also due to the lower
weight of the samples (maximum weight was 225.8 g)
when compared to the weight of the Lepidorhombus
spp. in the present study (maximum weight was
788 g). In contrast to the result verified in Aphanopus
carbo, the mean concentration of HgT in the muscle
of Lophius spp. (0.43 ± 0.32 mg kg?1 wet weight)
was higher than in liver (0.21 ± 0.16 mg kg?1 wet
weight). So the liver:muscle ratio is&amp;lt;1. This may
occur when mercury is no longer taken up, the
liver concentration decreases and muscle level after
some time may exceed the liver level. Nevertheless,

this ratio is a somewhat problematic parameter
because chronically contaminated fish can also show
a liver:muscle ratio&amp;lt;1.31 The mean percentage of
HgOrg for Lophius species was 84 ± 6% and 75 ± 8%,
respectively, for muscle and liver. This percentage
was 87 ± 7% in the muscle of Lepidorhombus spp.
Except for muscle of Lophius spp., HgT had
a significant positive correlation with length and
weight in both tissues (muscle and liver) species.
Pellegrini and Barghigiani34 and Barghigiani et al.37

also found a positive correlation between mercury
levels and weight in the muscle of Lepidorhombus
boscii. Storelli and Marcotrigiano32 found in Lophius
piscatorius and L. budegassa a mercury increase with
length.

The mean concentrations of selenium were quite
constant and for all species the range in the muscle
tissue was between 0.21 and 0.90 mg kg?1 wet weight.
Similar values were described by other authors.10,38

The greatest levels were found in the liver of the
Lophius spp. (range 0.71 – 2.69 mg kg?1 wet weight)
and Aphanopus carbo (range 2.77 – 5.78 mg kg?1 wet
weight). Aphanopus carbo weight was positively
correlated with levels of selenium in the muscle (P&amp;lt;
0.01) and liver (P &amp;lt;0.0001). Mean contents of ?-
tocopherol ranged from 1.1 to 15.9 mg kg?1 wet weight
in Lophius spp. and Aphanopus carbo, respectively.
Similar contents of ?-tocopherol in marine fish flesh
were reported by other authors.13,39 The best source
of ?-tocopherol was Aphanopus carbo, reaching a
maximum of 70.3 mg kg?1 wet weight. Nevertheless,
fish flesh contains low to modest amounts of vitamin E
when compared with other products.13 ?-Tocopherol
showed a significant positive correlation (P &amp;lt;0.05)
with Lepidorhombus spp. length and Lophius spp.
weight. No statistical significant differences (P &gt;
0.05) between sex and the analysed levels of the
two antioxidants (selenium and ?-tocopherol) were
verified.

No significant correlations were found between
HgT and selenium or ?-tocopherol in the muscle
of any studied species. This fact was also verified
by Barghigiani et al.37 and Plessi et al.40 among levels
of mercury and selenium evaluated in Lepidorhombus
boscii, Lophius piscatorius and in several other fish
species. However, in liver a significant negative
correlation was found between selenium and the
percentage of HgOrg (r = ?0.823; P &amp;lt;0.01).

The molar ratio Se:Hg in the muscle was similar
among species and varied from 1.7 (Helicolenus
dactylopterus) to 3.7 (Lophius spp.). Similar ratios were
presented by other authors.25,38,40 This ratio in the
liver tissue was 21.4 for Lophius spp. and 26.8 in
Aphanopus carbo. So, the selenium concentration is
higher than mercury in both tissues on a molar basis.
The ratio 1:1 among selenium and mercury in liver
and other tissues has been described.5

No significant correlation was obtained between
selenium and ?-tocopherol in the muscle, but the
trend was negative. According to De Silva and

Mercury, selenium and ?-tocopherol in fish

Andersen41 the vitamin E requirements are greater
in selenium-depleted fish, which is in agreement with
the results obtained here.

The species studied are considered deep-water,
long-lived (more than 5 years) and the higher trophic
level position may also contribute for the accumulation
of contaminant metals in their tissues. The efficient
accumulation of organic mercury in the muscle tissue
(nearly 90%) and its lack of elimination, results in an
increasing mercury concentration with both age and
trophic level in the marine grazing food-chain.31 This
fact may explain the higher level of organic mercury
in the muscle tissue of the studied species (organic
mercury mean percentage above 84%).

Different organisms can bioaccumulate mercury
at varying concentrations and eventually to harmful
levels, when their normal parameters are exceeded,
thus exposing the human population who consume
seafood to a potential danger.32 According to a
European Commission regulation15 the limit fixed for
this metal in the species studied is 1.0 mg kg?1 wet
weight with the exception of Helicolenus dactylopterus,
which t have a maximum allowed level of 0.50 mg kg?1

wet weight. Taking this into account, around
6% of Lophius spp. and Aphanopus carbo, 2%
of Lepidorhombus spp. and 70% of Helicolenus
dactylopterus have concentrations of total mercury
above the limit established by the EU regulation.

The Joint Food and Agriculture Organization
of the United Nations/World Health Organization
(FAO/WHO) Expert Committee on Food Addi-
tives (JECFA) recommends a provisional tolerable
weekly intake (PTWI) of 5 µg kg?1 body weight
for total mercury16 and 1.6 µg kg?1 body weight
for methylmercury.17 For the antioxidants, adequate
intakes of 30 – 70 µg Se day?1 and around 14 mg vita-
min E day?1 have been estimated for adults.11

Portugal is one of the European countries that has
the highest annual per capita fish consumption, around
57.1 kg,42 which represents 156 g fish person?1 day?1.
In addition, it should be noted that the consumption
is based on a high number of species. The estimated
daily intake (µg kg?1 body weight) for each fish
species studied was calculated based on the mean
levels obtained for total and organic mercury, and
considering an adult of 60 kg and the daily Portuguese
consumption of fish per capita (Table 5). Taking these
results into consideration, landings, import – export
balance and the Portuguese population and taking
account of the PTWI established by WHO,16,17

the fish species studied have to be consumed in
moderation, desirably not more than once a week.
So, these results lead to the conclusion that mercury
intake is a problem which justifies more attention.
On the other hand, in contrast to ?-tocopherol,
which only provides a small contribution to the
daily need, the muscle of the fishes studied is a
good source of selenium and could largely supply
the requirement.

suMMarY: total mercury (tHg), cadmium (Cd) and lead (pb) concentrations were investigated in muscle, liver and 
gonad tissue of black scabbardfish (Aphanopus carbo) from the southern northeast atlantic at three portuguese locations: 
the mainland and the archipelagos of the azores and Madeira. particular emphasis was placed on the comparison of metal 
levels between geographic locations. other factors such as size, sex and sexual maturity were also investigated. the median 
concentrations (mg/kg ww) of tHg showed a decreasing trend in the order liver&gt;muscle&gt;gonad. Cadmium levels decreased 
in the order liver&gt;gonad&gt;muscle and pb levels decreased in the order gonad&gt;liver&gt;muscle. according to the eu limits, the 
concentration observed in some specimens, particularly those of tHg, raises some food safety concerns. in all the tissues 
the concentrations of each toxic metal differed between locations. in particular: i) tHg concentrations in specimens from

introduCtion

Most fish species accumulate in their tissues 
contaminants present in the environment and in food 
(dugo et al., 2006). among the trace elements of 
general concern, total mercury (tHg), cadmium (Cd) 
and lead (pb) are of major potential ecotoxic signifi-
cance in the marine environment (Falcó et al., 2006; 
storelli, 2008). although these metals do not play 
any known metabolic function, they can cause dam-
age in the human body, interfering in the functioning 
of many of its basic systems: renal, cardiovascular, 
gastrointestinal, endocrine, nervous, etc. (pérez-Cid 
et al., 2001). Mercury is a highly toxic metal that 
occurs naturally in the environment as a result of 
metal volatilisation associated with volcanic events 
or cinnabar deposits (mercuric sulphide, Hgs). 
the anthropogenic contribution to environmental 
mercury is derived from metal extraction (e.g. gold 
mining) and from its direct or indirect industrial 
uses. unlike cadmium and lead, inorganic mercury 
can be methylated and form organic mercury com-
pounds covalently bound to carbon, such as meth-
ylmercury (CH3Hg), which is one of its most toxic 
forms (Hrudey et al., 1996). in addition, mercury is 
the only known metal that consistently biomagnifies 
through the food chain, i.e. predators accumulate 
higher mercury concentrations than those found in 
their prey (Monteiro et al., 1996). Cadmium is a sta-
ble, ubiquitous toxic metal that is not abundant in its 
pure state in the environment. it is a by-product of 
zinc, lead, and copper mining and smelting that en-
ters the organism through the diet and is concentrat-
ed mostly in the kidneys and the liver (epa, 1999). 
Fossil fuel combustion is the major source of pollut-
ant lead in the atmosphere. later it enters the marine 
environment through the atmospheric deposition by 
the wet and dry removal process (paterson, 1987). 
lead can accumulate in the bone, affect the central 
nervous system and interfere with the metabolism of 
hemoglobin. living organisms tend to bioaccumu-
late mercury, cadmium and lead since they absorb 
the toxic substances at a greater rate than they are 
metabolised or excreted. as a result, bioaccumula-
tion of toxic metals poses a serious threat to animal 
health, including that of humans.

the growing concerns about the presence of 
toxic metals in food led the european Commission 
to establish legal limits for several chemical contam-
inants. For black scabbardfish (Aphanopus carbo), 
maximum permissible levels of mercury, cadmium 
and lead are 1.0 mg/kg, 0.05 mg/kg and 0.30 mg/kg, 
respectively (eu 2006, 2008).

the black scabbardfish (family trichuridae) is 
a top predator that inhabits the ne atlantic slopes 
around isolated island groups and seamounts be-
tween 200 and 1600 m in depth (parin, 1986; Mar-
tins and Ferreira, 1995). Juveniles are mesopelagic 
and adults are benthopelagic, migrating to midwater 
at night to feed on fish, squid and crustaceans (Mer-
rett and Haedrich, 1997). this species is appreciated 
by fish consumers in portugal, especially in the Ma-
deira archipelago. 

the aim of this study was to characterise the lev-
els of mercury, cadmium and lead in muscle, gonad 
and liver of black scabbardfish caught off three dif-
ferent portuguese regions (the mainland, the azores 
and Madeira). Factors such as region, length, sex, 
and maturity stage that can influence the variabil-
ity of metal concentrations in black scabbardfish in 
those three tissues were also investigated. lastly, 
metal levels obtained in tissues were compared with 
established limits defined by the european Commu-
nity regulation (2006, 2008). 

Materials and MetHods 

black scabbardfish samples were obtained on a 
routine monthly basis at the landing ports of ses-
imbra (mainland portugal) and Funchal (Madeira). 
they were obtained on an irregular basis at santa 
Maria (the azores) (Fig. 1), since there is no fish-
ery targeting the species in this archipelago. For the 
purpose of this study, samples were collected in Feb-
ruary-March, June-July and october-november (the 
spawning period in Madeiran waters, Figueiredo et 
al., 2003) from May 2005 to december 2007 but, 
due to problems involving sampling dispatch, it was 
only possible to sample two seasons in the azores 
and Madeira. For each individual, total length (mm), 
total weight (g) and sex were recorded. Maturity 

significativamente más altos que en Madeira y en azores; y iii) en todos los tejidos analizados, los niveles de pb fueron signi-
ficativamente más elevados en azores que en el continente. estas discrepancias en los niveles tóxicos entre localizaciones son 
discutidas en relación con aspectos de dinámica de la especie y la influencia de características ambientales de cada región.

stage was assigned for each sampled individual ac-
cording to the scale proposed by gordo et al. (2000). 
the otoliths were removed and age was assessed by 
counting annuli in sectioned otoliths (Vieira et al., 
2009). samples of dorsal muscle (post-opercular 
region), gonad and liver were collected (±10 g), 
stored in a plastic bag and preserved at -20ºC. the 
frozen samples were sent to two laboratories (dop-
iMar, uaç and inrb, ip/l-ipiMar) for mercury, 
and cadmium and lead analysis, respectively. the 
number of samples analysed by each laboratory was 
different because the procedure for cadmium and lead 
analysis uses much more material than the method 
for tHg analysis. prior to the analysis, samples were 
defrosted at room temperature and homogenised in a 
food blender. all laboratory ware was cleaned with 
Hno3 (10%) for 48 h and rinsed with ultrapure wa-
ter (18.2 M? cm) to avoid contamination. Chemical 
reagents were pro-analysis or superior. Mercury, 
cadmium and lead concentrations were reported as 
milligrams per kilogram on a wet weight basis (mg/
kg ww). all analyses were carried out at least in du-
plicate; an external calibration method was used for 
quantitative analysis. 

Total mercury analysis

total mercury (tHg) was determined by cold 
vapour atomic absorption spectrophotometry 
(CVaas) according to the procedures described by 
Hatch and ott, (1968). tissue sub-samples (0.2-1 g 
ww) were subjected to a wet mineralisation by di-
gestion in sulphuric acid and subsequently oxidised 
to Hg2+, using potassium permanganate. Mercury 
quantification was performed with a bacharach 
Coleman Model 50d Mercury analyser system. 

the Hg2+ was reduced to Hg0 by adding stannous 
chloride.  the volatile Hg0 was bubbled into the 
closed system of the analyser and the absorption 
was measured (wavelength at 253.7 nm). the de-
tection limit (expressed in mg/kg ww) was 0.012. 
total mercury concentrations in the sample were 
determined in duplicate using an external calibra-
tion. the linear calibration curve was obtained by 
measuring the absorbance of six standards, with 
different concentrations, which were prepared 
by dilution from a 1000 mg l-1 mercuric chloride 
solution (Merck, germany). analytical quality 
control was provided through within- and between-
laboratory quality control procedures employed 
throughout the study period. the accuracy of the 
method (expressed as relative error) was within 
10%, and was monitored throughout the analysis 
of the certified reference materials (dogfish mus-
cle, dorM-2; dogfish liver, dolt-2) from the 
national research Council of Canada, ottawa. the 
results obtained in this study (4.49 ± 0.25 mg/kg; 
2.14 ± 0.16 mg/kg) were in the range of the certi-
fied values (4.64 ± 0.26 mg/kg and 2.14 ± 0.28 mg/
kg) for dorM-2 and dolt-2, respectively. the 
precision (or reproducibility) of the method (ex-
pressed as the coefficient of variation of duplicates 
within and between batches) was within the usual 
10% for total mercury determinations in biological 
samples (saltzman et al., 1983). interference with 
sensitivity due to matrix and pre-treatment were as-
sessed by the method of standard additions before 
the wet mineralisation digestion, and the average 
recoveries of added inorganic mercury was 96.8% 
(s.d. =11.3, n=12). 

Cadmium and lead analysis

determination of cadmium and lead levels was 
performed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry 
(Faas), according to the procedures described by 
Jorhem (2000). edible portion samples (10 g) were 
dry-ashed at 500ºC through a gradual temperature 
increase. ash was dissolved in concentrated nitric 
acid and the solution obtained was evaporated to 
dryness. the final residue was dissolved once again 
with 5 ml nitric acid 15% (v/v) and transferred to 
10-ml volumetric flasks, and final volumes were ad-
justed with ultrapure water. quantification of these 
elements was performed using a spectr aa-20 Var-
ian spectrophotometer with deuterium background 
correction (l = 228.8 nm for Cd and l = 217.0 nm

for pb). detection limits (expressed in mg/kg ww) 
were 0.02 (Cd) and 0.01 (pb). Certified reference 
material tort-2 (lobster hepatopancreas), from the 
national research Council of Canada, was tested in 
the same conditions as the samples in order to assess 
analytical method accuracy. the results obtained 
in this study (0.35 ± 0.06 mg/kg for pb and 26.8 ± 
0.1 mg/kg for Cd) were in the range of the certified 
values (0.35 ± 0.13 mg/kg for pb and 26.7 ± 0.6 mg/
kg for Cd). Concentrations of pb and Cd were calcu-
lated from linear calibration plots obtained by meas-
urement of the absorbance of six standard solutions. 
these solutions were prepared by dilution of 1000 
mg l-1 lead and cadmium nitrate solutions (Merck, 
germany).

Statistical analysis 

For muscle, liver and gonad samples, the dif-
ferences in log-transformed tHg, Cd and pb con-
centrations between the classes of region, sex and 
maturity stage were explored through box plots. 

data logarithmic transformation was applied to 
reduce the wide range of values and thus facilitate 
the joint plot of the three tissues for each factor. 
to evaluate the contribution of region, sex, matu-
rity stage and covariate length, univariate general 
linear models (glM) were adjusted to data for 
each combination of tissue and toxic metal. Mul-
tiple comparisons of estimated marginal means of 
metal concentrations between different locations 
were performed using the least significant dif-
ference test (lsd test). these tests were used to 
evaluate the statistical significance of the differ-
ences in concentration between locations. in all 
statistical analyses the level of significance was 
set at 0.05.

(years) and the number of specimens aged; and the 
median and range of metal concentrations are sum-
marised in tables 1 (mercury) and 2 (cadmium and 
lead). there were differences in the length ranges 
between geographic locations: specimens from 
Madeira were larger (total length &gt;1150 mm) than 
those from the azores and the mainland (tables 1 
and 2). the sex ratio estimates varied between loca-
tions (table 1). Maturity stages (Ms) were not all 
found at each of the three locations, and in particular 
no mature individuals were observed off mainland 
portugal (lack of Ms iV and V).

Mercury

Concentrations of total mercury differed be-
tween tissues: they were highest in the liver, and 
decreased from muscle to gonad (table 1). the 
adjusted glM (table 3) showed that the factors re-
gion, maturity stage and covariate length explained 
a fairly high percentage of the variance in mercury 
concentrations in liver (r2 = 0.30) and muscle (r2 
= 0.59). For gonad this variance was lower (r2 

=0.19). total mercury levels were significantly 
different between regions and maturity stages 
(p&lt;0.001 in both cases) for all tissues. length was 
also significant for all tissues (p&lt;0.001). the levels 
of total mercury differed between sexes in liver and 
muscle (p&lt;0.001 for both), but no differences were 
observed in gonad (p= 0.93).

For the three tissues, the highest total mercury 
levels were registered off Madeira and the lowest 
off the mainland (Fig. 2a). the total mercury levels 
in liver (maximum of 50.23 mg/kg ww recorded 
in one specimen from Madeira) were commonly 
much higher than those in the other two tissues (ta-
ble 1). total mercury in gonad showed the lowest 

levels, with a minimum (0.03 mg/kg) and a maxi-
mum (2.74 mg/kg) in specimens from the azores. 
accordingly, the levels registered for the muscle 
were higher, respectively 1.45, 0.71 and 0.69 mg/
kg ww for Madeira, the azores and the mainland 
(table 1). the lsd test indicated that total mercu-
ry means in muscle from specimens caught off the 
azores and the mainland were significantly lower 
(p&lt;0.001) than those from specimens caught off 
Madeira (table 4). in gonad and liver, means were 
not statistically different between the mainland and 
the azores. For muscle and liver the differences 
between Madeira and the mainland and between 
Madeira and the azores were statistically signifi-
cant (p&lt;0.001; table 4). the mean total mercury 
levels in muscle and liver were significantly higher 
(p&lt;0.001) in females than in males (Fig. 2b, table 
3). although males showed higher mean mercury 
concentrations in gonad than females, this differ-
ence was not statistically significant (Fig. 2b; table 
3). total mercury levels increased from maturity 
stage i to maturity stage iV and decreased in the 
post-spawning stage (Ms V; Fig. 2c). the highest 
variability of total mercury levels was registered 
for maturity stage ii (Fig. 2c).

Cadmium 

in all three regions the cadmium concentration 
was higher in liver tissue than in gonad or muscle 
(table 2 and Fig. 3a). the highest cadmium con-
centration was found in liver of fish caught off the 
mainland (30.24 mg/kg ww) and the lowest (below 
0.02 mg/kg ww) in muscle from specimens of all 
three regions. the cadmium concentration in go-
nads ranged from 0.03 (Madeira) to 1.30 mg/kg ww 
(mainland).

the adjusted glM (table 3) showed that re-
gion, maturity stage and length explained a low 
percentage of the variance of cadmium concentra-
tions in the three tissues (liver; r2 = 0.19; muscle, 
r2 = 0.10 and gonad, r2 = 0.27). For all the tissues, 
the adjusted glM (table 3) revealed that region 
was a significant factor in explaining concentration 
differences in muscle (p&lt;0.001), liver (p&lt;0.01) and 
gonad (p&lt;0.05). the maturity stage was only sig-
nificant in the case of gonad (p&lt;0.05). the pairwise 
comparison indicated that cadmium mean concen-
trations in muscle and liver differed significantly 
(p&lt;0.001) between the azores and the mainland 
(table 4). For gonad tissue, significant differences 
(p&lt;0.01) were found only between Madeira and the 
mainland.

Male gonad showed higher median cadmium 
levels than female gonad, but the difference was not 
statistically significant (p&gt;0.05) (Fig. 3b, table 3). 
differences between maturity stages were detected for 
gonad (p&lt;0.05, table 3). Maturity stages iii and iV 
showed the lowest median levels and in the remaining 
stages median values were similar (Fig. 3c).

Lead

in general, lead showed a decreasing gradient 
from gonad to liver and lastly to muscle (table 2). 
the region was the only factor that explained the 
variance in lead concentrations for all analysed tis-
sues (liver, r2 =0.19; muscle, r2 = 0.08 and gonad, 
r2 =0.36) (table 3), of which the median lead levels 
were highest for the azores (table 2). the maxi-
mum concentration (1.15 mg/kg ww) was observed 
in the gonad of a specimen from the azores and the 
minimum (&lt;0.01 mg/kg ww) in the liver of speci-
mens from Madeira and the mainland. the median 
concentrations in muscle were similar within all the 
regions (0.04-0.05 mg/kg ww; table 2). the pair-
wise comparisons (table 4) showed that lead levels 
in liver and gonad differed significantly between 
Madeira and the azores (p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.001, re-
spectively). the mainland and the azores differed 
from each other in terms of concentrations in all three 
tissues (p&lt;0.001 for gonad and muscle; p&lt;0.05 for 
liver; table 4). lead levels in all three tissues did not 
differ between sexes (Fig. 4b). in liver, the ranges of 
lead levels for the first three maturity stages (i, ii and 
iii) were fairly wide, exhibiting a decreasing trend 
from stage i to iV. Median levels of stage V were 
similar to those of stage ii (Fig. 4c).

disCussion

Copper, zinc and iron are essential for fish metabo-
lism but mercury, cadmium and lead have no known 
role in biological systems. these non-essential metals 
use a similar metabolic pathway to that of essential 
minerals, being assimilated by fish from water, food 
or sediment, and consequently accumulating in their 
tissues (Canli and atli, 2003). the concentration of 
mercury is enhanced by the high availability of its sta-
ble organic form below the thermocline. this form, 
especially methylmercury, occurs in the cold deep 
waters of the north atlantic and is assimilated by or-
ganisms four times more efficiently than the inorganic 
form (Mason et al., 1995).

in general, deepwater species show an increased 
potential for accumulating trace metals (gordon et 
al., 1995). it has also been reported that mercury ac-
cumulation in fish increases with trophic level, age, 
size and depth (riisgård and Hansen, 1990; Mon-
teiro et al., 1991; Joiris et al., 1995; Magalhães et 
al., 2007). this is the case for A. carbo, a voracious 
predator, living at depths of around 1200-1700 m 
and exhibiting fairly rapid growth rates in the first 
years of life (Vieira et al., this issue). the median 
mercury concentrations obtained in this study are in 
agreement with the levels reported in the literature 
(afonso et al., 2007, 2008 and bebiano et al., 2007). 
the median total mercury concentrations found in 
muscle tissues from A. carbo were approximately 
5-10 times higher than those reported in other 
benthopelagic species caught in more northern areas 
of the atlantic (Mormede and davis, 2001b; Cronin 
et al., 1998). Moreover, our results were within a 
similar range to those obtained for other deep-water 
species captured off the azores (Magalhães et al., 
2007) and mainland portugal (afonso et al., 2008), 

and for hydrothermal vent fish species at the Mid-
atlantic ridge (Martins et al., 2006).

total mercury levels observed in black scabbard-
fish caught off the azores and Madeira were sig-
nificantly higher than those caught off the mainland. 
potential sources of mercury are the volcanism asso-
ciated with the expansion of the Mid-atlantic ridge 
and the occurrence of mercury-enriched Mediterra-
nean water, which flows into the north atlantic at 
depths below 1000 m (Johnson and stevens, 2000). 
However, the greatest source of mercury seems to be 
the atmospheric deposition of elemental mercury as-
sociated with the global cycle by way of long-range 
transport (Monteiro et al., 1996).

While little is known about trace metal com-
position of water masses in the northeast atlantic, 
these archipelagos are also characterised by highly 
dynamic oceanographic, atmospheric and geologi-
cal processes, namely the north atlantic gyre, the 
azores front, the upwelling off the iberian penin-
sula and the Canary islands current (pollard and 
pu, 1985), which can contribute to the dispersal and 
concentration of pollutants in these areas. 

the higher total mercury levels found in speci-
mens from Madeira in comparison with those from 
the azores might be related to the size of the speci-
mens analysed. the length of specimens from Ma-
deira was greater (total length &gt;1150 mm) than that 
of specimens from the azores, and a higher percent-
age of females (93%) was observed in Madeira indi-
viduals. Mercury concentrations in tissues increased 
with fish length (data not shown), so the larger 
(older) fish showed higher concentrations than the 
smaller (young) ones. Females showed higher mer-
cury concentrations than males, a result that can be 
related to differences in growth rates between sexes 
(Vieira et al., 2009). as mercury accumulation is

MerCurY, CadMiuM and lead in A. cArbo • 85

age-dependent, the faster-growing sex (males) ex-
hibit lower concentrations due to higher dilution of 
pollutant as a result of tissue growth. in addition, the 
higher total mercury concentrations were found in 
the highest maturity stages and mostly corresponded 
to specimens from Madeira, which were also the 
largest individuals analysed. these differences in 
maturity stages between regions reflect the repro-
ductive dynamics of this species in the different 
regions, which is characterised by the inexistence of 
mature individuals off the mainland (Ms: iV and V) 
and their occurrence only off Madeira (neves et al., 
2009). these observations might constitute a better 
explanation for the higher mercury concentrations 
found in Madeiran specimens than in the mainland 
individuals. 

similarly to mercury, the enrichment of cadmium 
in the deep sea suggests higher concentrations in 
benthic than in epipelagic biota (Mormede and dav-
ies, 2001a). the cadmium concentrations in muscle 
of deep-water fish are generally low in comparison 
to levels found in the liver (bustamante et al., 2003). 
in the present study, median levels of cadmium in 
the liver of black scabbardfish were 450 times higher 
than those found in the muscle, in agreement with 
the results obtained for other deep-water species 
(Cronin et al., 1998; Hornung et al., 1993; Mormede 
and davies, 2001b) and those reported for the same 
species by afonso et al. (2007). Cadmium contents 
were significantly higher in liver and in muscle in 
mainland individuals than in azores individuals, and 
significantly higher in muscle and in gonads than in 
Madeiran individuals. these findings were expected 
because this metal is mostly derived from anthropo-
genic sources (e.g. metallurgical industries). 

lead concentrations in fish muscle are generally 
lower than in liver, a pattern that is also observed 
for cadmium (Mormede and davies, 2001a). in the 
present study, lead levels found in muscle samples 
from the three portuguese regions were of the same 
magnitude as those reported by afonso et al. (2007) 
and Cronin et al. (1998). our results were also con-
sistent with those observed by Mormede and dav-
ies (2001a) in several deep-water species caught off 
the rockall trough (west scotland). in agreement 
with afonso et al. (2007), we obtained higher lead 
levels in the azorean than in the Madeiran speci-
mens, but similar levels between Madeira and the 
mainland. Furthermore, it was observed that the 
majority of lead levels in the muscle of specimens 
collected off the mainland were below the detec-

tion limit of this method (&lt;0.01 mg/kg ww). the 
lead levels in gonads and liver were 3 times higher 
in azorean specimens than in those found in the 
other two regions. though the azores are distant 
from a known anthropogenic source of metal pol-
lution, it is also conceivable that the input of lead 
may originate from remote sources of industrial 
pollution or from mineral dusts by way of “long-
range atmospheric transport”. Furthermore, arsenic 
and other elements such as lead originating in the 
nW african sahara have been found in material 
collected from azorean “dust-events” (reis et al., 
2002), and may later settle down in the deep sea. 
in addition, hydrothermal activity associated with 
nearby shallow- and deep-vent waters can directly 
contribute to this metal enrichment in deep-water 
species from this oceanic region (Wallenstein et 
al., 2009; Cosson et al., 2008). 

it is generally accepted that metal concentra-
tions in the organism reflect the exposure in the 
aquatic environment and the intake through diet 
(Mormede and davies, 2001a). a probable reason 
for the highly significant region effect observed 
in this study might be the differences in the diet 
of black scabbardfish from these three geographic 
areas. studies on stomach contents of this species 
in the study region have so far been inconclusive, 
mainly due to the characteristics of the fishery. in 
longline fisheries the specimens remain attached 
to the gear long enough for the stomach contents 
to be completely digested, resulting in a high rate 
of emptiness (93%) (Freitas,1998; anon, 2000). 
nevertheless, older published data have described 
the existence of lower mesopelagic and upper bath-
ypelagic fish species (e.g. Maul,1961) and more 
recently Freitas (1998) found crustacean species, 
cephalopods and fish from the meso- and bathype-
lagic zones in the stomachs of A.carbo captured in 
Madeira waters. there is also evidence that black 
scabbardfish from the mainland feed on the crus-
tacean Aristeus antennatus (i. Figueiredo, pers. 
com.), so a preferred crustacean diet might explain 
the higher cadmium concentrations found in main-
land specimens than in speciments from the azores 
and Madeira, given the fact that crustaceans tend 
to accumulate cadmium, mainly in the hepatopan-
creas (atsdr, 2008). a cephalopod-based diet 
could also contribute to the intake of toxic met-
als in black scabbardfish since they also prey on 
these invertebrates (nakamura and parin, 1993, 
Muus et al., 1998). in a recent study, lourenço

et al. (2009) showed significant concentrations of 
cadmium (0.04–0.33 mg/kg ww), lead (0.02–0.09 
mg/kg ww) and mercury (0.05–0.12 mg/kg ww) 
in three different species of cephalopods caught 
off the portuguese coast. the variability of metal 
concentrations can be attributed to the availability 
of different prey (crustaceans, cephalopods and/or 
fishes) in the portuguese regions studied. However, 
without additional data on dietary composition, it is 
not possible to explain these geographic differences 
based only on the black scabbardfish diet.

regarding the metals distribution in the differ-
ent tissues, it is recognised that the mechanisms 
by which fish regulate the accumulation of metals 
may be linked to the metal absorption or elimina-
tion processes, which in turn seem related to tissue 
and organ characteristics (reinfelder et al., 1998). 
black scabbardfish has higher levels of mercury and 
cadmium in liver than in the other analysed tissues. 
the high concentrations found in this organ can be 
explained by the liver’s ability to accumulate large 
amounts of these metals, through the formation of a 
soluble metal-binding protein, and by its important 
role in storage, redistribution, detoxification, and 
transformation of pollutants (evans et al., 1993; 
Mormede and davies, 2001a,b). 

the low concentrations of lead in liver and mus-
cle have their origins in several mechanisms that are 
involved in this metal intake by fishes. remarkably, 
there are no known specific metal-binding cytosolic 
proteins in the liver with high affinity for lead. 
thus, rather than being accumulated in the liver, 
the absorbed lead is quickly distributed to other tis-
sues (gašpi? et al., 2002) such as gonad tissues, as 
evidenced in this study. to our knowledge, this is 
the first study that reports on levels of total mercury, 
cadmium and lead in gonad of black scabbardfish. 
the inclusion of this organ in ecotoxicological stud-
ies allows a better understanding of metal distribu-
tion throughout the fish’s lifespan.

With regard to public health, muscle is the most 
important tissue used to estimate metal concentra-
tions since it is mainly used for human consumption. 
However, the toxic metal content in liver and female 
gonad should still be an issue of concern because 
these organs are also consumed in the Madeira ar-
chipelago. the median concentrations of mercury 
found in muscle of black scabbardfish from both 
the mainland and the azores were below the limit 
established by the eu (1.0 mg kg-1 ww), whereas the 
median concentration in specimens from Madeira 

were above this limit. For all the regions, the median 
total mercury concentrations were above 1.0 mg kg-1 

ww in liver and below this limit in gonads. Median 
lead concentrations were under the limit value (0.30 
mg/kg ww) established by the eu (2006, 2008). the 
limit of 0.05 mg/kg ww established by the eu (2006, 
2008) for cadmium was exceeded in both liver and 
gonads, but it was not reached in muscle in any of 
the regions studied. 

in view of the high levels of mercury found and 
some results observed for the other two metals, it 
is not safe to assume that this species may be con-
sumed regularly and without restrictions. it is advis-
able to perform a risk analysis in order to evaluate 
the ptWi (provisional tolerable weekly intake) of 
black scabbardfish in the overall diet of portuguese 
consumers. 

taken together, the presence of high mercury 
levels in tissues from this benthopelagic species is 
expected and is related not only to the biochemistry 
of this metal but also to the ecological and biological 
characteristics of the species. A.carbo lives at great 
depths, occupies a high trophic level, is long-lived 
and is a predator subjected to longer burdens of this 
contaminant during its lifetime as a consequence of 
a diet rich in meso- and bathypelagic species.

regarding cadmium and lead levels, the speci-
mens landed on the mainland were significantly dif-
ferent from those landed in the azores. Cadmium 
concentrations were higher in the mainland speci-
mens, whereas lead concentrations were higher in 
the azorean specimens. Contrary to the described 
distribution pattern of mercury, the region is the 
only factor that explains the observed variability of 
cadmium and lead levels. this may be related to the 
absence of biomagnification of these metals. as for 
cadmium and lead levels, the differences between 
maturity stages can be related to the energetic and 
chemical composition oscillations that occur during 
the reproductive cycle of this species. 

in summary, the similarities and dissimilarities 
observed between regions might be due to differ-
ences in trace metal contents in the water, species 
physiology, and feeding preferences of the fish in-
habiting these three portuguese regions. in view of 
the fact that the exploration of deep-sea fish stocks 
has increased greatly, particularly in the north 
atlantic, it is important to monitor the levels of 
metals in abiotic and biotic compartments of these 
marine ecosystems. extending our knowledge to the 
biological cycle of A. carbo, including its feeding

ecology and sampling in other geographic areas, 
may not only provide a better understanding of toxic 
metals bioaccumulation mechanisms but also help 
to identify black scabbardfish populations within its 
geographic distribution.

ABSTRACT 

The intake of methyl-Hg through consumption of three common cephalopod species, 

cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis), squid (Loligo vulgaris), and octopus (Octopus vulgaris), in 

Portugal as well as the associated probability of exceeding the provisional tolerable weekly 

intake (PTWI) were estimated by combining methyl-Hg contamination levels in these three 

cephalopods with constructed consumption scenarios or with a hypothesized consumption 

distribution for the general Portuguese population. 

It was found that squid presents no serious health concern with respect to methyl-Hg, but, 

cuttlefish and octopus consumption should not exceed two 150 g meals per week. 

Moreover, the methyl-Hg risk assessment for Portuguese consumers revealed no danger 

concerning the observed cephalopods consumption levels. Tail estimation (TE) estimator 

was more accurate for lower probabilities, rendering accurate risk estimations different 

from zero. However, for higher probabilities, the much simpler plug-in (PI) estimator could 

be applied. Additionally, the limitations of a deterministic approach were shown. 

 

KEYWORDS: methylmercury, cuttlefish, octopus, squid, risk assessment, extreme value

1. INTRODUCTION 

During the last decades, the health benefits of a diet rich in seafood have been extensively 

recognized. In particular, ?3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (?3-PUFA) are associated with 

decreased morbidity and mortality due to various diseases. Several epidemiological 

studies
(1)

 have found a reduced risk of coronary heart disease, hypertension, stroke and 

consequent further effects due to the beneficial effects of these fatty acids on lipids —



namely, cholesterol—, blood pressure, eicosanoids and coagulation rate. For instance, the 

World Health Organization (WHO) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) 

recommend a regular fish consumption of 1-2 servings per week in order to provide an 

equivalent of 200-500 mg of the ?3-PUFA eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids.
(2)

 

However, seafood can also be a source of pernicious contaminants: PCBs, dioxins, residues 

of pesticides and contaminant metals. 

Cephalopods, in particular, can be a source of contaminant metals, since they may 

accumulate these metals in their tissues.
(3,4)

 A recent paper has found significant levels of 

various toxic metals in cephalopods, such as octopus or squid, caught in Portuguese 

waters.
(5)

 On the other hand, cephalopods are one of the most important seafood groups 

captured in Europe.
(6)

 Concerning Portuguese consumers, cephalopods had a share of 

approximately 8 % of the wholesale market sales. Furthermore, these cephalopods 

correspond to an economic value (in terms of auction transaction) approximately three 

times more important, representing a quarter of the market.
(7)

 

Among contaminant metals, mercury is not known to play any metabolic function and can 

be very toxic to humans, even at very low concentrations.
(8)

 WHO and FAO have 

established as provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) value 5 µg/kg for total 

mercury.
(9)

 For methylmercury (methyl-Hg), a highly toxic organic compound of mercury, 

given its ready and easy absorption by the gastrointestinal tract, WHO and FAO reduced in 

2003 the PTWI from 3.3 (two thirds of the total mercury) to 1.6 µg/kg.
(10)

 Therefore, a 

quantitative assessment of the methyl-Hg intake by populations eating large amounts of 

cephalopods as well by the general population should be carried out in order to have more 

information about the contribution of each species to a given methyl-Hg intake.
(11)

 This 



concern is even greater for the cephalopods consumption in Southern Europe and, 

particularly, in Portugal, because these populations frequently consume cephalopods, 

mainly cuttlefish, octopus, and squid.
(12)

 

Contaminant assessment can be performed by combining food consumption data or, in the 

absence of this information, consumption estimates and plausible scenarios with 

contaminant concentration levels, according to different approaches: deterministic or 

probabilistic. In the former, a single ‘worst case’ point estimate of each input variable 

(consumption and contamination level) is used. In the latter, the variability of all input 

variables can be accounted for by using appropriate probability distributions with 

appropriate parameters.
(11)

 This approach is increasingly being used for the assessment of 

contaminants in foods.
(11,13,14)

 Its output is a probability distribution providing some insight 

into the variability of the assessed intake in a population. Thus, in this way it is possible to 

estimate the probability that the individual exposure to a specific heavy metal exceeds the 

PTWI. In a large population, an accurate estimation of this quantity is very important since 

even a difference of 1 ‰ involves a large number of individuals. However, the estimation 

of this probability highly depends on the tail behaviour of the distribution, since PTWI 

values are usually higher than most individual intakes. The main statistical tool for this is 

the extreme value theory (EVT).
(15)

 This tool has been used in very different areas, such as 

hydrology or finance.
(16)

 In these areas, extreme values are of crucial importance. For 

contamination and consumption data, extreme values are also very important, since risk 

mainly concerns highly polluted food or high consumptions. EVT properly addresses these 

extremes because it takes full account of the very high (or very low) observed values.
(15)

 

The principle is to model the tail of an exposure distribution by a Pareto type distribution, 

characterized by a Pareto index, which can be interpreted as a risk index.
(15)

 This index is 



estimated by the Hill estimator, which, in turn, shows a large instability, producing the so 

called ‘Hill-horror plot’.
(16)

 This instability may be greatly improved by using bias 

correction techniques,
(17,18)

 hence, ensuring the achievement of more reliable estimates of 

the population at risk. 

Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to estimate the methyl-Hg intake through the 

consumption of three cephalopod species, cuttlefish, octopus, and squid, in Portugal and, 

thus, to estimate the portion of a given population (whether the whole Portuguese 

population or sub-populations displaying specific consumption patterns) at risk. 

 

2. MATERIAL AND METHODS 

2.1. Raw Data 

The individuals of the studied species, cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis), squid (Loligo vulgaris), 

and octopus (Octopus vulgaris) were adults and were caught in Portuguese continental 

waters with the purpose of ensuring a representative sampling of the cephalopod products 

marketed in Portugal. The weight ranged between 540 and 3100 g (a sample size of 37 

individuals), 65 and 1200 g (26), 430 and 4900 g (43), for cuttlefish, squid, and octopus, 

respectively. Total Hg content was determined by cold vapour atomic absorption 

spectrometry
(19)

 in a Bacharach Coleman MAS-50D Mercury Analyser. Methyl-Hg was 

extracted by a previously described method
(20)

 and its level determined by atomic 

absorption spectrometry in a LECO AMA 254 Automatic Mercury Analyser. Moreover, 

whereas total Hg content was determined in all individuals, methyl-Hg was determined 

only in 10 individuals of each species. All contents were expressed in mg/kg of fresh 

weight. Furthermore, for those individuals whose methyl-Hg content was not determined, it 

was assumed that the ratio between methyl-Hg and Hg contents was identical to that 



calculated for the 10 individuals of each species, that is, 90.7, 86.6, and 83.9 %, for 

cuttlefish, squid, and octopus, respectively. 

Apparent consumption data was estimated from cephalopods capture totals in Portuguese 

waters (data from Portuguese National Statistics Institute, Instituto Nacional de 

Estatística
(21)

) and trade data (data from EUROSTAT).
(22)

 Thus, import values were added 

to capture volumes and export values were subtracted. Afterwards, the attained apparent 

consumption values were divided by the population
(23)

 and admitting that two thirds of the 

cephalopods weight would be surely edible, it was possible to estimate weekly per capita 

consumptions of 10.2, 31.5, and 30.4 g/(week.person), for cuttlefish, squid, and octopus, 

respectively. 

 

2.2. Raw Data Processing 

Probability distributions were fitted to the contamination and consumption data. Using all 

data and imposing as previous condition that methyl-Hg contents must be positive values, 

the best probability distributions, according to ?
2
 tests for goodness of fit of the observed 

distributions to theoretical ones, were achieved with the software @ RISK
?

 – advanced risk 

analysis for spreadsheets, from Palisade Corporation (Ithaca, NY, USA), version 4.5, 2005. 

For consumption, log-normal distributions with means of 10.2, 31.5, and 30.4 

g/(week.person), and truncated in zero (an enforced minimum) were selected for cuttlefish, 

squid, and octopus, respectively. In Figure 1, the distribution for octopus is presented. 

Hence, a significant frequency at near zero was achieved with this solution, accounting for 

that portion of the population which does not eat cephalopod products. Log-normal 

distributions are widely used distributional forms in probabilistic assessment
(11)

 and seem to 



reflect the consumption patterns of cephalopod products in Portugal. Moreover, in the 

United States, using more complete data on the overall consumption of fish by the general 

population (from a survey conducted by the National Marine Fisheries Service), strong log-

normal fits were found.
(24)

 

 

2.3. Intake Levels Calculation 

A distribution of the intake levels of methyl-Hg for cuttlefish, squid, and octopus can be 

achieved by combining the consumption log-normal distributions and the methyl-Hg 

content distributions for each studied cephalopod species. Alternatively, the latter 

distributions can be combined with a given weekly personal consumption (encompassing 

specific scenarios, from one portion to three portions of 150 g per week). In order to attain 

the intake distributions, values of each distribution curve are randomly sampled according 

to the Monte-Carlo method.
(25)

 In this method, a given randomly selected cephalopod 

consumption from a virtual consumer (or a precise value of a specific scenario) is 

multiplied by the contaminant content in the corresponding cephalopod species, also 

randomly selected. This procedure is repeated many times with the software @ RISK
?

, 

rendering a random sampling size of 10000. Output values are divided by an average body 

weight, 60 kg,
(10)

 producing a distribution of weekly toxic metal intakes expressed in µg per 

week and kg of body weight. For this approach, the random sampling size must be largely 

superior to the sum of all sample sizes. This condition is fulfilled because 10000 is much 

larger than the sum of 43 (maximum number of contaminant analyses) with 2 (effectively 

introduced consumption data, that is, average and standard deviation). 

 



2.4. Risk Assessment 

Methyl-Hg risks to human health are assessed by comparing the weekly intake level with 

the recommended safe exposure level, the methyl-Hg PTWI.
(26)

 There are two alternatives 

for estimating the risk: the plug-in (PI) and the tail estimation (TE) based estimators.
(15)

 The 

mathematical formulas and methodology were extensively presented in a previous paper.
(12)

 

TE estimation is based on the EVT, which is focused on the tail estimation of the 

distribution of the heavy metals intakes. Accordingly, the distribution tail is fitted to a 

Pareto law, which consists in estimating parameters C and ? for ‘sufficiently large’ 

numbers. These numbers are necessarily the k largest observed values of the output 

distribution. Estimation of the parameters can be done according to the formulas:

where, 

Hk,n – Hill estimator; 

k – number of considered largest values in the sample; 

n – sample size. 

The Hill estimator
(16)

 is very sensitive to the choice of k. In fact, its bias increases with k, 

whereas its variance decreases with k. This bias problem is explained by the perturbation of 

data results through a slowly varying function, which causes deviations from a Pareto 

law.
(27)

 So, a bias corrected Hill estimator may be required. For bias correction, the Hill 

estimator must be interpreted as an estimator of the QQ plot slope perturbed by a small 



deviation induced by the L(x).
(15)

 The estimation of the bias corrected parameters is done 

through the least squares method applied to the expression

?1 = 1 .
(28)

 

In this way, the bias corrected estimator of ? is calculated. These estimations can be done 

for different values of k, enabling to find the optimal sample fraction k* by minimizing the 

asymptotic mean squared error of the Hill estimator.
(15)

 With optimal k*, the risk of 

exceeding the PTWI, P(Xi&gt;PTWI), may be estimated in a more accurate way. 

 

3. RESULTS 

3.1. Distribution of Me-Hg Content in Cuttlefish, Octopus, and Squid 

The best fits for the methyl-Hg content in the three cephalopod species according to ?
2
 test 

for goodness of fit of the observed distributions to theoretical ones were attained with 

extreme value distributions (Table I). All these distributions were truncated at zero in order 

to avoid negative values. This solution was preferred to truncating at the limit of detection, 

since some of the experimental data were below that limit. The fitted distributions means 

and standard deviations were identical to the same parameters of the raw data itself. The 

order of the methyl-Hg content means was the following one: cuttlefish&gt;octopus&gt;squid. 



 

3.2. Risk Assessment for Cephalopods in Specific Scenarios 

Hypothesizing specific scenarios for cuttlefish, octopus, and squid consumption and using 

the methyl-Hg distributions (Table I), it was possible to obtain intake distributions whose 

variability only depends upon the methyl-Hg contents found in each cephalopod species 

(Table II). 

The average weekly intake of methyl-Hg per kg of body weight was always below the 

methyl-Hg PTWI (1.6 µg/(week×kg body weight)) even for the worst case scenario, a 

consumption of three portions of 150 g of cuttlefish per week. But, besides the average 

values, other values were possible since some specimens may be more contaminated with 

methyl-Hg than other. Therefore, for an adequate risk assessment, the probability of 

exceeding the PTWI, P(Xi&gt;PTWI), was estimated. The PI and the TE estimators were used 

for this objective. 

Regarding the PI estimator, methyl-Hg weekly intake distribution values never exceeded 

the PTWI for squid in all hypothesized scenarios, leading to a null probability. Likewise, 

for the consumption of only one portion of 150 g of any cephalopod species, the maximum 

values of the 10000 values of the methyl-Hg intake distributions were always below the 

methyl-Hg PTWI, thus entailing a null probability. This illustrates a clear disadvantage of 

this estimator: risk cannot be evaluated if PTWI is too large when compared to the higher 

observed values.
(15)

 Since a null risk does not exist, precise quantification requires another 

estimation method, that is, the TE estimation. However, for cuttlefish and octopus 

consumptions of two and three portions per week, risk estimated by PI method was 

different from zero. Moreover, this risk had an exponential progression, since, for instance, 



a 50 % increase of the methyl-Hg average intake (from 0.4726 to 0.7114 µg/(week×kg 

body weight)) led to a P(Xi&gt;PTWI) almost 18 times higher (from 0.10 % to 1.75 %). This 

last probability was undoubtedly non-negligible. Thus, someone consuming three portions 

of octopus each week is already exposed to some methyl-Hg risk and the same applies to 

cuttlefish. These risks albeit low have already some significance: approximately one in 57 

and one in 164 consumers (eating three portions per week), for octopus and cuttlefish, 

respectively, may be above PTWI. This may be the case of a consumer that eats 

octopus/cuttlefish from a particularly polluted area or a cephalopod whose specific traits 

(size, maturation, sex, etc.) may entail a higher level of contamination by methyl-Hg. 

On the other hand, a more accurate estimation of P(Xi&gt;PTWI) requires a more complex 

estimator based on EVT, the TE estimator. The k largest observed values are crucial for TE, 

thus, an optimal k* must be chosen. This is done according to theoretical assumptions and 

mathematical estimations (see Material and Methods, Risk Assessment), where 

minimization of the Hill estimator’s variance and of its bias determines the choice of k*. 

This calculation yielded TE estimator probabilities all different from zero. Nevertheless, for 

one portion per week, P(Xi&gt;PTWI) values were very low, not exceeding 0.00019 % 

(1:526316). The same applies to all squid consumption scenarios. As with PI estimator, 

with higher average methyl-Hg intakes, an exponential progression of the probabilities was 

observed. Interestingly, for the consumption of three weekly portions of cuttlefish and 

octopus, TE estimator yielded P(Xi&gt;PTWI) values almost identical to those achieved with 

the PI estimator. 

 



3.3. Risk Assessment for Cephalopods in the Portuguese Population 

The estimated maximum weekly intake of methyl-Hg per kg of body weight was always 

below the PTWI, hence, PI estimates of P(Xi&gt;PTWI) were zero (Table III). Once again, 

this means that the PI estimator is flawed, since, when the PTWI is larger than the highest 

observed (estimated) intake value, P(Xi&gt;PTWI) becomes zero, but, a null risk never exists. 

The TE estimator offers an alternative. As explained above, this required calculation of bias 

corrected Hill estimators of the risk index ?, because of the substantial instability observed 

with the uncorrected Hill estimators (Figure 2). However, such instability was lower than 

in other studies because consumption values were taken from a single and simple 

distribution and not from a consumption survey, thus, the heterogeneity of consumption 

behaviours behind an enhanced instability was lacking.
(15)

 Additionally, the variance factor 

of AMSE was important for all cephalopod species, thus entailing k* values (Table III) 

higher than those determined in a previous study.
(29)

 In the case of the octopus, this meant 

using the largest 335 intake values of the output distributions for estimating the bias 

corrected Hill estimator, which, in turn, enabled to calculate the associated probability of 

exceeding the methyl-Hg PTWI. This probability was extremely low for cuttlefish and 

squid, less than one in one million. However, for octopus, the TE estimator yielded a 

relatively higher risk, since a P(Xi&gt;PTWI) of 1:21000 (0.0048 %) was estimated (Table III 

and Figure 1). 

 

4. DISCUSSION 

With respect to risk assessment in specific scenarios, various studies have already pointed 

out the relevance of a moderate consumption of some seafood species, such as black 



scabbardfish,
(29,30)

 as a result of a high methyl-Hg content. However, for cephalopods, there 

are no recommendations of moderate consumption. In fact, no research, to the knowledge 

of the authors, has examined the risks associated to methyl-Hg in cephalopods. Hence, no 

consumption recommendations have been issued. This study may help to change this 

situation, since it clearly shows that the risk of exceeding the methyl-Hg PTWI is non-

negligible for cuttlefish or octopus consumption frequencies equal to or higher than three 

150 g meals every week. Thus, whereas for squid no consumption restriction seems 

necessary, for the other two species an ideal maximal consumption of two 150 g meals per 

week must be advised. However, it is not to be excluded the formulation of a further 

restriction of the cephalopods consumption frequencies if other contaminants imparting 

higher health risks to consumption of this seafood are found. Namely, this may be the case 

for cadmium (Cd), since it has been reported that Cd levels in octopus sometimes exceeded 

the recommended EU limit of 1.0 mg.kg
-1

 while total Hg levels never surpassed the 0.5 

mg.kg
-1

 EU limit.
(5)

 Effectively, molluscs very often accumulate Cd in digestive glands,
(3)

 

being found lower amounts in the arms and mantle.
(31)

 Therefore, future studies should also 

assess the Cd risk associated to octopus consumption. 

Additionally, the estimated risks associated to cephalopods consumption must be 

compounded with those of other seafood also presenting substantial levels of methyl-Hg. 

Therefore, someone consuming two cuttlefish or octopus meals per week is taking a non-

negligible risk and, for consumers eating seafood several times every week, consumption 

should be even more restrained and the addition of meals with fish, specially, from deep 

waters, should be avoided. 

Another interesting point is the comparison between the probabilities of exceeding the 

methyl-Hg PTWI for cuttlefish and octopus consumption and the average methyl-Hg levels 



in these species. In fact, whereas cuttlefish presents higher contamination levels than 

octopus (0.106 vs 0.094 mg/kg), P(Xi&gt;PTWI) values are systematically higher for octopus, 

regardless of the used estimator (Table II). This is due to the parameters of the contaminant 

distributions, since both are extreme value distributions. The high ? scale parameter of the 

octopus methyl-Hg distribution is the main cause of this mathematical phenomenon (Table 

I). The octopus methyl-Hg distribution albeit presenting a lower average than the cuttlefish 

methyl-Hg distribution has a much heavier tail than the latter distribution, as can be proved 

by the PI estimations —for instance, for three meals per week, the cuttlefish distribution of 

10000 points shows 61 above the PTWI, while the octopus distribution of 10000 points has 

175 above the PTWI. 

The combination of specific scenarios with the variability of methyl-Hg contents in 

cephalopods is a semi-deterministic approach.
(11)

 This provides a more realistic assessment 

of risk. In fact, the non-negligible risks obtained for cuttlefish and octopus compare with 

the absence of total Hg risk reported in the literature.
(5)

 Latter authors used a full 

deterministic approach, that is, the average Hg content in cuttlefish and octopus was 

multiplied by an assumed consumption frequency of seven meals per week. Although this 

scenario was more extreme than those considered in this study, it was concluded that 

estimated Hg weekly intake was much lower than established PTWI,
(5)

 thus leaving implicit 

that no risk arises from Hg content in cephalopods. Of course, this work concerns methyl-

Hg (PTWI: 1.6 µg/(week×kg body weight)) and not total Hg (PTWI: 5.0 µg/(week×kg 

body weight)) and methyl-Hg in this study is, at least, 80 % of total Hg content. 

Nevertheless, this example highlights the great importance of taking any data variability 

into consideration in order to reach a sound and more rigorous risk assessment. 



The comparison between both estimators (PI and TE) also provides some insight into the 

advantages and drawbacks of each estimator. The PI estimator does not allow a precise 

quantification when risk is small, since a null risk does not exist. Indeed, this conclusion 

was also mentioned by other studies,
(15)

 which also state that a small sample size impairs 

the rigour of the PI method. On the contrary, the TE estimator allows a much more accurate 

quantification of risk in such circumstances. Nevertheless, for higher probabilities, there 

was a remarkable convergence of both estimators, which seems to support the adequacy of 

the much simpler PI estimator for a probability range between 0.1 and 2 %. 

Nonetheless, the assumption of specific cephalopod consumption frequencies is not enough 

if a proper risk assessment in any given population is intended. It is deterministic on the 

side of consumption, since, for this input variable, a single point is used (for instance, 3 

meals of octopus per week). However, there is a distribution of consumption values. 

Unfortunately, given the absence of detailed consumption surveys (differentiating among 

eaten seafood species) in Portugal, such distribution had to be hypothesized using a limited 

array of information. Therefore, log-normal distributions with means equal to the calculated 

Portuguese cephalopod consumption averages were considered instead. Hence, combining 

these consumption distributions with the contaminants distributions, it was possible to 

obtain in this full probabilistic approach more realistic distributions of the weekly intake of 

methyl-Hg in Portugal and to improve the associated risk assessment. 

Concerning cuttlefish and squid, given the size of the Portuguese population, 10617575,
(23)

 

risk may be considered negligible. With respect to octopus, risk is still small (Figure 3), but 

may be considered as non-negligible, since a risk of exceeding the methyl-Hg PTWI of 

1:21000 represents approximately 500 individuals in Portugal. However, it must be 

emphasized that the established PTWI level already integrates a safety buffer related to 



those individuals more sensitive to the health effects of a high methyl-Hg intake. 

Furthermore, such individuals are a minority in the population. Accordingly, it can be 

accepted a negligible risk associated to the consumption of octopus per se in the Portuguese 

population. Moreover, the relatively higher risk ascribed to octopus is due to the 

combination of high consumption levels (30.4 g/(week.person)) with relatively high 

contamination levels (0.094 mg/kg). Though cuttlefish presents an even higher methyl-Hg 

average content (0.106 mg/kg), its consumption levels are lower (only 

10.2 g/(week.person)). On the other hand, squid presents higher consumption levels 

(31.5 g/(week.person)), but its contamination by methyl-Hg is very low (0.035 mg/kg). 

Once again, it should be remembered that these estimated risks for the consumption of 

cephalopods must be combined with risk arising from the consumption of other seafood 

species and food items in general. So, there is a greater risk in the Portuguese population of 

surpassing methyl-Hg PTWI through food consumption than that risk estimated for octopus 

only. In fact, in the French population, the probability of exceeding the methyl-Hg PTWI 

through food consumption was substantially higher, at least, in the most favourable 

scenario, 7.40 %.
(15)

 Moreover, Portuguese consumers also eat other food items with 

relatively high methyl-Hg levels, such as black scabbardfish. A previous study
(29)

 has 

shown that the consumption of this fish species in Portugal entails a methyl-Hg risk of 1.19 

or 1.81 %, according to the PI and TE methods, respectively. Additionally, another study
(12)

 

using the five most consumed fish species in Portugal produced a probability of exceeding 

the methyl-Hg PTWI as a result of fish consumption of 6.71 %. Accordingly, methyl-Hg in 

food has to be treated as an important public health concern and further studies on the 

subject are warranted. 



In all this discussion of the results, the underlying assumptions should not be forgotten. 

Namely, one hypothesis underlying the utilization of available data is that individuals are 

subjected to a constant exposure over time and keep the same consumption behaviour over 

their lifetime. This is a strong assumption which cannot be prevented, but might be relaxed 

by combining used methods with some ideas proposed by other authors,
(32,33)

 if time series 

of consumption are observed. These methods were compared and discussed in a previous 

study.
(34)

 Additionally, it is hypothesized that occasional short-term excursions above the 

methyl-Hg PTWI would present no major health effect, provided that the average intake 

over long periods does not exceed the PTWI. Accordingly, the parameter of interest could 

be viewed as the probability of occasional short-term excursions above the PTWI rather 

than a true probability to develop a disease as a result of the exposure to methyl-Hg. 

Therefore, as main results of this study, it can be mentioned that while squid presents no 

serious health concern with respect to methyl-Hg, cuttlefish and octopus consumption 

should be restrained to two 150 g meals per week. Moreover, the methyl-Hg risk 

assessment for Portuguese consumers revealed no danger concerning the observed 

cuttlefish and squid consumption levels. On the other hand, octopus consumption by 

Portuguese consumers presented a relatively higher methyl-Hg risk (1:21000). However, 

given the various assumptions used in this study, it cannot be considered a public health 

problem. Nonetheless, this methyl-Hg risk associated to octopus consumption in Portugal 

can be compounded by the risk of other foods containing significant methyl-Hg, thus 

making any new studies on methyl-Hg risk warranted. 

TE estimator was more accurate for lower probabilities, namely for the assessment of risk 

associated to one or two meals per week or in the Portuguese population in general, 

rendering accurate risk estimations different from zero. However, for higher probabilities 



(roughly between 0.1 and 2 %), there was a remarkable convergence of both estimators, 

supporting the adequacy of applying the much simpler PI estimator. Additionally, the 

limitations of a deterministic approach were shown, being of great importance the 

assumption of variability for the two input variables, contamination and consumption 

levels.

Marine organisms are known to accumulate arsenic (As) in the
range of 1–100 mg kg-1 from their environment and food sources.
The majority of arsenic is present as organoarsenic compounds,
metabolized from inorganic arsenic present in seawater or accu-
mulated from food sources such as algae or other fish. The aim of
this study was to evaluate total arsenic content in the muscle of
eight fish species, three cephalopods, and one crustacean con-
sumed in Portugal. The measurement of total arsenic (10 individ-
uals of each species) was carried out by EDXRF (Energy Dispersive
X-Ray Fluorescence Method). The highest concentrations were
found in Norway lobster (30.3 ± 8.7 mg kg-1 wet weight), followed
by common octopus (25.9 ± 8.4 mg kg-1 wet weight). Within fish
species, wild gilthead sea bream, anglerfish, and megrim species
presented values around 12 mg kg,-1 and in the others the average
was lower than 10 mg kg-1. Taking into consideration the tolerable
daily intake recommended by the World Health Organization
(WHO; 0.05 mg As kg-1 body weight), the obtained results of total
arsenic in the studied species do not represent a hazard for
human consumption.

Seafood Arsenic Content 33

INTRODUCTION

Arsenic (As) is an important and ubiquitous element which has become one
of the toxic trace elements under concern in recent decades (Karadjova
et al., 2007). This element has no known beneficial biological function, and
the long-term exposure may be harmful to health because of its acute and
chronic toxicity (FSA, 2005, 2006).

The aquatic environment is important in the global cycling of arsenic.
The background level of arsenic in marine environments is slightly higher
(2–3 mg/l) than in freshwater and terrestrial environments (Moore and
Ramamoorthy, 1985 and Phillips, 1990 in Klaric et al., 2004). Total human
intake of arsenic occurs mainly via the food chain and depends on the
quantity of seafood consumption (Suñer et al., 1999; Cava-Montesinos et al.,
2005). Research has shown that marine organisms have the ability to accu-
mulate arsenic naturally present in seawater and food, rather than only
accumulating arsenic due to local pollution (Eisler, 1994 in ATSDR, 2000).
Moreover, atmospheric deposits, output from rivers, and upwelling from
marine sediments lead to enrichment of arsenic in marine organisms (Neff,
1997). In general, arsenic is present in high concentrations (orders of micro-
grams per gram) in seafood (Li et al., 2003). The arsenic levels in fish and
shellfish are usually about 4–5 ppm, but may be as high as 170 ppm
(Bennett, 1986, NAS, 1977b, and Schroeder and Balassa, 1966 in ATSDR,
2000). It is known that intrinsic factors such as growth (size, weight), age,
gender, sexual maturity, physiology, and stress influence the accumulation
of trace metals in marine organisms (Phillips and Rainbow, 1993). For that
reason, issues related to arsenic content in aquatic organisms and sea fish,
in particular, have attracted considerable attention (Lai et al., 2001). And
therefore, suitable dietary guidelines are needed so that safe consumption is
ensured.

In seafood, arsenic can be found in various chemical forms (chemical
species) and oxidation states that differ in their degree of toxicity and the
pathologies associated with them (Muñoz et al., 2000; Li et al., 2003). As a
general rule, inorganic arsenic, which predominates in seawater and sedi-
ments, is the most toxic form which can damage DNA and cause cancer.
Most of the arsenic in seafood is present in nontoxic organic forms, such
as arsenobetaine (Lai et al., 1999), that are metabolically inert and easily
eliminated by the human body (Fattorini et al., 2004) and, therefore, rep-
resent a low risk to the consumers of fishery products (Neff, 1997). No
more than 2–10% of the total arsenic is potentially harmful as a toxic form
(Fowler, 1983 and Freiberg, 1988 in Klaric et al., 2004). Since it is difficult
to reliably measure the forms of arsenic present, most surveys measure
total arsenic.

At the present time, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA, 1993)
accords the highest priority (maximum concentration) to arsenic in its program

on toxic elements in foods. The guidance level for crustacea is 76 mg kg?1 and
86 mg kg?1for clams, oysters, and mussels.

The aim of this work was to determine the total arsenic content in com-
mon species of fish, a crustacean, and cephalopods consumed in Portugal.
Moreover, this study provides information regarding this element in a wide
range of samples of fresh fish. Muscle was chosen for analysis because it is
the major tissue consumed by humans and constitutes a significant percentage
of the organism’s body mass.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Sample Collection

The samples analyzed in this study were selected on the basis of their high
domestic consumption by the general Portuguese population. In total, about
120 samples of eight fish species, three cephalopods, and one crustacean
were analyzed. The studied species were sardine (Sardina pilchardus),
hake (Merluccius merluccius), wild and cultured gilthead sea bream (Sparus
aurata), anglerfish species (Lophius piscatorius and L. budegassa), black
scabbardfish (Aphanopus carbo), blackbelly rosefish (Helicolenus
dactylopterus), megrim species (Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis and L. boscii),
cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis), European squid (Loligo vulgaris), common
octopus (Octopus vulgaris), and Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus).
Species were obtained during several bottom trawl research surveys carried
out by the INRB-IP/IPIMAR, in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean along the
Portuguese coast during 2004–2005. Only wild gilthead sea bream was
bought into one of the most important auction markets—Peniche in November
2005. Cultured gilthead sea bream were delivered by Portuguese aquacul-
tures in 2004–2005.

Sample Preparation

Before analysis, samples were prepared by separating the edible portion
from the inedible (guts, scales, heads, and bones). Only the commonly edi-
ble part (muscle) of the animal was selected for analysis. The number of indi-
viduals of each species can be found in Table 1. Samples were homogenized
in a food blender, frozen and freeze-dried for 48 h at ?45°C and low pres-
sure (approximately 10?1 atm). Further, samples were powdered and stored
at ?20°C under controlled humidity conditions until analysis.

Analytical Methods

Total concentrations of As were determined by Energy Dispersive X-Ray
Fluorescence Method (EDXRF). The energy resolution was 135 eV at

5.9 keV and the acquisition system was a Nucleus PCA card. Quantitative
calculations were made by the fundamental parameters method
(Carvalho et al., 2005). Experimental parameters were obtained by cali-
bration, using standard reference materials. The X-ray generator was
operated at 50 kV and 20 mA, and a typical acquisition time of 1000 s
was used.

The samples were prepared by mixing and pressing the powder into
pellets 2.0 cm in diameter without any chemical pretreatment. Each pel-
let was glued onto a Mylar film, on a sample holder, and placed directly
in the X-ray beam for element determination. For each sample, a mini-
mum of two replicates were made in order to reduce the risk of analyti-
cal error.

The accuracy of measurements was tested by the analysis of certified
reference materials, MA-A-2 (fish flesh, obtained from the International
Atomic Energy Agency), SRM 1566 (oyster tissue, obtained from the
National Bureau of Standards), TORT-2 (lobster hepatopancreas, obtained
from National Research Council of Canada), and SRM 1571 (Orchard leaves,
obtained from National Institute of Standards and Technology). The values
obtained were 2.5 ± 0.7, 13.5 ± 1.5, 21.3 ± 1.8 and 13.9 ± 1.5 ?g g?1, dry
weight, which is in accordance with the certified ones (2.6 ± 0.1, 13.4 ± 1.9,
21.6 ± 1.8, and 14.0 ± 2.0 ?g g?1), respectively. Detection limit (DL) was
0.7 ?g g?1. Concentrations of arsenic are presented as mg kg?1 on a wet
weight basis.

Statistical Analysis

The statistical treatment of the results was performed using Software
STATISTICA, version 6.0 (StatSoft, Inc., 2003). The Kolmogorov–Smirnov
test (or the Shapiro-Wilk’s W test) and the Levene’s test were used to check
the normality and the homogeneity of variance of data, respectively (Zar,
1999). Comparisons were made using the Kruskall–Wallis test when the
conditions were nonparametric (a violation of the test of homogeneity of
variances assumption). Correlations between total arsenic concentrations
and total length were analyzed for each species separately with Pearson
correlation coefficients for linear correlation. The significance level for statisti-
cal analyses was always tested at a = 0.05 (p &amp;lt;.05).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Analysis of Seafood Samples

Results for the determination of total arsenic in the seafood species analyzed
in this study are shown in Table 1. In all cases, number of samples analyzed,
average values ± standard deviation, and range in which they lie are shown.

The arsenic content (mg kg?1, wet weight [ww]) in the species analyzed
was in the range of 1.7–22.8 for fish, 3.5–44.7 for cephalopods, and 23.1–51.2
for crustacean (Table 1 and Figure 1). Median levels of arsenic in these
three groups were 5.1, 17.0, and 31.0 mg kg?1 ww, respectively (Figure 1).
This variation of arsenic in marine organisms is due to many factors, such as
species, geographic location (Anke et al., 1997 and Navarro et al., 1992a in
Delgado-Andrade et al., 2003), temperature, salinity of the water, as well as
weight (Norin et al., 1985 in Storelli and Marcotrigiano, 2000).

The highest mean total As concentration was found in the Norway lob-
ster Nephrops norvegicus (32.2 mg kg?1, ww). Moreover, this species
showed the widest range within all species (Table 1). It has been reported
that total As concentrations in the tissues of crustaceans and molluscs are
generally higher than those found in marine fish (Phillips, 1990 in De Gieter
et al., 2002). According to ATSDR (2000), the arsenic is mainly accumulated
in the exoskeleton of invertebrates, which means a higher concentration of
As is found in crustaceans. For prawns, arsenic values range from 9 to
19 mg kg?1; for shrimps, from&amp;lt;1 to 40 mg kg?1; and for crabs, from&amp;lt;1 to
70 mg kg?1 (Norin et al., 1985 in Storelli and Marcotrigiano, 2000). The
levels reported in the literature for crustaceans also present a very wide
range of 2.31–149.16 ?g g?1, dw (Brooke and Evans, 1981; Flanjak, 1982;
Vlieg et al., 1991; Attar et al., 1992; Larsen et al., 1993; López et al., 1994;
Muñoz et al., 1999, 2000). High arsenic levels in the muscle of these bottom
dwellers can be associated with their habitat being closer to the muddy
sediments, which are always higher in arsenic than surface waters (Byrd,

1988 and Trembley and Gobeil, 1990 in Storelli and Marcotrigiano, 2000).
Another reason is that this decapod feeds on polychaetes, crustaceans,
molluscs, echinoderms, and detritus (Figueiredo and Thomas, 1967 in Krång &amp;amp;
Rosenqvist, 2006; Baden et al., 1990), which consequently present high lev-
els of arsenic. Therefore, habitat and feeding are other important factors
contributing to the variability of arsenic in marine organisms. The samples
in this present work had relatively large sizes, which may also explain the
high levels of arsenic. In fact, the significant differences found (p &amp;lt;.05) in
total arsenic concentrations among Norway lobster, European squid, and
almost all species studied (except for anglerfish, megrim, and wild gilthead
sea bream) also relate to the different diet and habitat in which they live.

The levels for common octopus and cuttlefish are the highest in the
group (25.9 and 19.8 mg kg?1, ww, respectively) of cephalopods, while the
European squid exhibited the lowest concentration (4.0 mg kg?1, ww).
Cephalopods are carnivorous, active predators; and because they have very
high feeding rates, most of the arsenic can be assumed to be incorporated
by the diet (Villanueva and Bustamante, 2006). In the case of Octopus
vulgaris, the largest contents may be due to the fact that these species are
characterized by feeding primarily on gastropods and bivalves, which
are filterers and consequently present high levels of arsenic; and secondly,
are benthic species living in direct contact with the substratum, which rep-
resents another possible pathway for arsenic accumulation (Seixas et al.,
2005). On the other hand, the European squid feeds on fish, crustaceans,

and cephalopods; but fish is the major and sometimes the only component, so
the concentrations of arsenic are lower in this species compared to other ceph-
alopods. The common octopus and cuttlefish are the only species that do not
show significant differences (p &amp;lt;.05) within the group of cephalopods.

The highest element level in fish samples was observed in anglerfish
and megrim species, with mean values of 11.7 and 11.6 mg kg?1 ww,
respectively. The analyzed samples of black scabbardfish presented lower
levels (2.9 mg kg?1, ww), followed by the samples of cultured gilthead sea
bream (4.0 mg kg?1, ww), blackbelly rosefish (4.4 mg kg?1, ww), and sar-
dine (4.9 mg kg?1, ww). Marked variation in total arsenic concentrations
observed in fish samples reflects the variation among species.

The high concentrations found in different species of anglerfish and
megrim may be principally due to different feeding habits. In fact, anglerfish
is a bathydemersal fish that is found on sandy and muddy bottoms feeding
mostly on other fish and being half buried in the sediment waiting for their
prey. Megrim is a benthic fish that occurs on soft bottoms and feeds mainly
on bivalves and small bottom-dwelling fishes as well as squids and crusta-
ceans that generally show high levels of arsenic. In addition, Survey on
Arsenic in Food (MAFF, 1982) recognized that flatfishes, which are bottom
feeders and live on or close to the sea bed, are readily exposed to the
greater quantities of arsenic that accumulate in sediments than other spe-
cies. So, it seems that marine organisms acquire their arsenic burden
through the food chain (Norin et al., 1985 in Storelli and Marcotrigiano,
2000). But in contrast to Hg, for example, As seems not to biomagnify or
bioaccumulate (De Gieter et al., 2002). Hence, black scabbardfish showed
low levels of arsenic despite being a top predator that feeds on crustaceans
and cephalopods. Thus, and according to an extensive study of the factors
affecting bioaccumulation of arsenic in two streams in western Maryland in
1997–1998, no evidence of biomagnifications was found since arsenic con-
centrations in organisms tend to decrease with increasing trophic level
(Mason et al., 2000). In this group, the differences between the concentra-
tions found in the megrim in respect to black scabbardfish and cultured
gilthead sea bream were significant (p &amp;lt;.05). The same is true for the
anglerfish and the latter two fish species.

The arsenic levels in wild gilthead sea bream (10.7 mg kg?1, ww) are in
general much higher than in the cultured (4.0 mg kg?1, ww; Table 1), which
may be due to a different diet, especially in cultured fish where feeds are
used. Nevertheless, wild gilthead sea bream was not statistically different
from all other species (p &gt; .05).

reported in the literature for crustaceans also present a very wide range of
1.69–137.32 mg kg?1, ww (Muñoz et al., 2000). Moreover, in the case of
Norway lobster, much higher concentrations were obtained in the present
study than in other surveys conducted by the Food Standards Agency (FSA,
2005, 2006). In contrast, in another study conducted in Australia (Fabris
et al., 2006), the mean content was slightly higher (50.7 ± 18.6 mg kg?1, ww)
and in agreement with our results.

The concentrations found in muscle tissue of hake, anglerfish, and cuttle-
fish are similar to those referred, respectively, by Storelli and Marcotrigiano
(2000), De Gieter et al. (2002), and Lavilla et al. (2008). Moreover, values of
arsenic given in a report performed on the Portuguese coast with common
octopus (Seixas et al., 2005) are in the same order as those found in this
study. In addition, the samples of anglerfish present levels similar to those
reported in the literature (Mormede and Davies, 2001; De Gieter et al., 2002).

Compared to the results found by Falcó et al. (2006) in species that are
among the most consumed by the general Spanish population, the present
work showed higher levels for sardine, hake, cuttlefish, and European
squid. In contrast to this, arsenic concentrations found in our study were
lower compared with another study in Spain (Muñoz et al., 2000) for the
same species. These authors also found high levels of total arsenic in megrim
(28.45 ± 17.71 mg kg?1, ww) and a wide range of the data (4.14–67.38 mg kg?1,
ww). Even larger values were found in the work done by Lavilla et al.
(2008). The high values of arsenic often reported in the literature may be
due to the fact that the species could have been captured in highly contam-
inated areas.

In two studies (Schaeffer et al., 2005; FSA, 2005) of wild and farmed sea
bream, the arsenic levels found (5.26 mg kg?1, dw and 2.11 mg kg?1, ww,
respectively) were below those obtained in the present study. Moreover,
arsenic concentrations found in our work were higher in wild and cultured
sea bream muscle when compared to other important species from aquacul-
ture, such as sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrux, and yellow perch, Perca flave-
scens (FSA, 2005; González et al., 2006).

There are few data in the literature for total arsenic in black scabbardfish
and in blackbelly rosefish, but they vary within a range of&amp;lt;0.02–26.49 mg kg?1,
ww (Mormede and Davies, 2001) and 3.91–29.69 mg kg?1, ww (Amato et al.,
2006), respectively. These levels showed a very wide dispersion when com-
pared to our results (1.71–4.80 and 2.84–5.78 mg kg?1, ww, respectively).

Correlations

There were no significant correlations (p &gt; .05) between total arsenic and
body length in almost all species (Table 3). Only in the case of sardine,
Sardina pilchardus, was a significant (positive) relationship (p &amp;lt;.05) found
(Table 3). This means that the levels of this element usually increase in

sardine with body size, so larger and/or older fish generally have higher
concentrations than smaller or younger fish (Storelli et al., 2002). However,
no other correlations were evident, which means that total arsenic concen-
trations are not related to body size but probably due to the small sample
size.

Legislation and Health Considerations

At the international level, very few countries have published guidelines/
legislation to regulate the maximum concentration of total arsenic in sea-
food products (British Food Manufacturing Industries Research Association,
1993). The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee (1983) imposed a limit of
0.1 mg kg?1, ww for total arsenic in food (Muñoz et al., 2000; De Gieter
et al., 2002), and the Arsenic in Food Regulations (SI 1959 no. 831 in FSA,
2005), in the UK, lays down a general limit of 1 mg kg?1. Hong Kong has
the most tolerant legislation in the world, with maximum concentrations of
6 mg kg?1, ww for fish and fish products and 10 mg kg?1, ww for shellfish
and shellfish products (Phillips et al., 1982 in Muñoz et al., 2000). The Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) suggests a limit of 76 mg kg?1 for crustacea
(FDA, 1993). There is presently no Europe-wide regulation of arsenic in
food (FSA, 2005).

Considering the tolerable daily intake recommended by WHO (0.05 mg
As kg?1 body weight; WHO, 1983), the obtained results of total arsenic in
the studied species do not represent a hazard for human consumption. Only
the Norway lobster exceeded this value. However, taking into account the
FDA (1993) consideration, most of the arsenic compounds found are
methylated, and therefore are relatively low in toxicity and do not present a
concern to the consumer.

CONCLUSIONS

The levels of total arsenic varied widely among the studied species, which
may be due to different dietary habits and environmental characteristics.
The results suggest that concentrations of this element are lower in fish than
in crustaceans. It is also worth pointing out that farmed gilthead sea bream
presented levels of total arsenic much lower than the wild one. From this
work we also conclude that the technique, EDXRF, is suitable for this kind
of study. It is easy to use, nondestructive, and the samples do not require
any chemical treatment and therefore avoid possible contamination.

Levels of Toxic Metals in Canned Seafood

ABSTRACT. The production of canned fish has decreased in recent
years; however, several European countries still consume large amounts
of these products. It is well known that such products may contain some
toxic metals such as mercury, cadmium and lead. In order to determine
the level of these three elements in canned seafood, several products
were analyzed (more than 1800 samples). The mean total mercury level
was 0.12 ± 0.14 mg/kg wet weight, with the highest content found in
canned tuna. However, such values did not exceed the proposed limit for
tuna by EU (1.0 mg/kg). All analyzed samples showed lead levels lower
than the indicated limits. On the other hand, a few samples (less than
2%) of canned tuna and squid exceeded the limit values proposed for
cadmium, 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg, respectively. Taking into account the way
in which these products are consumed, it can be concluded that canned
seafood products do not represent a risk in terms of human diet. [Article

KEYWORDS. Canned seafood products, total mercury, cadmium, lead,
legal limits

INTRODUCTION

Fish and seafood can be an important part of a balanced diet for humans;
however, some fish accumulate contaminants present in the aquatic environ-
ment including mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb), which are toler-
ated only at very low levels (Voegborlo et al., 1999). Although toxic metal
content in the oceans is very low, higher contents are found in localized areas,
like waters polluted by chemical and geochemical processes. Mercury accu-
mulates up the food chain; therefore, high levels can be found in predatory
species caught in areas with a high content of this metal. As a result, the con-
sumption of fish becomes the primary pathway by which humans are exposed
to mercury (Wheeler, 1996) and other metals. Actually, there are limits for
these three metals, defined by European Community Regulation 466/2001
(EU, 2001) as amended by European Community Regulation 221/2002 (EU,
2002). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also has the responsibility to
safeguard human health through regulation of foods and drugs. This agency
suggests maximum tolerable daily intake for cadmium (55 µg/person/day)
(FDA, 1993a) and lead (75 µg/person/day) (FDA, 1993b). World Health Orga-
nization (WHO) established a provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) of 5
µg/kg body weight (bw)/week for total mercury (WHO, 1972), of which no
more than two thirds (3.3 µg/kg bw/week) should be from methylmercury
(WHO, 1989; WHO, 2000).

Canned fish is a product that still records a reasonable demand in several
European countries, namely in Mediterranean ones, and frequently the possi-
bility that such seafood products show high levels of toxic metals is debated.
Several studies were performed along this line many years ago, principally in
canned tuna (Chow et al., 1974; Sapunar and Jusic, 1979; Duve, 1981;
Schindler, 1985; Hardisson et al., 1986; Romieu et al., 1994; Gajewska et al.,
1995; Voegborlo et al., 1999), but there is scarcity of information for other
canned seafood products.

The purpose of the present study was to characterize the contents of total
Hg, Cd and Pb in several canned seafood products commercialized in Portugal
in order to evaluate the existence of contamination in these products.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

All seafood products utilized in this study were purchased from local retail-
ers between 2000 and 2002. Canned tuna, chub mackerel, sardine, eel, lam-
prey, squid, octopus, blue mussels and some seafood spreads were examined.

Cans were opened and, after draining off the oil, the meat was homogenized in
a food blender (Moulinette 320, Moulinex, France) and the samples quickly
analyzed.

Total Hg was determined by cold vapor atomic absorption according to the
procedure developed by Hatch and Ott (1968), described by Joiris et al.
(1991). Accuracy was verified using the Certified Reference Material CRM-
463 (tuna fish muscle: 2.85 ± 0.16 µg g?1 Hg dry weight) of IRMM. The mean
result, for five replicates (2.87 ± 0.09 µg g?1 Hg dry weight) was in the range
of CRM-463 with a relative error of 0.1%. Detection limit (DL) was 0.01 mg
kg?1. Cd and Pb were performed by flame atomic absorption, following the
method described in AOAC (1990). Accuracy was examined by participating
in a Food Analysis Performance Assessment Scheme organized by Central
Science Laboratory (Metallic Contaminants–FAPAS, Series 7, Round 40,
2002, England). The laboratory performance is inside the satisfactory range,
i.e., |Z|? 2 (Z = ?1.1 for Pb; Z = 0.3 for Cd). Detection limits were 0.01 and
0.02 for Cd and Pb, respectively. Analytical data for Hg, Cd and Pb are re-
ported as mg kg?1 on a wet weight basis. All data analysis was achieved using
STATISTICA (Statsof, Inc., USA, 2000).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Table 1 presents the results of total mercury determination in all canned
seafood products analyzed. The highest values were found in canned tuna,
tuna spread, eel and lamprey. However, these concentrations did not exceed
the limits proposed by EU (2001 and 2002), 1.0 (tuna and eel) and 0.5 mg kg?1

(lamprey). The mean values obtained by other authors for canned tuna (Noirfalise
and Fouassin, 1981; Gajewwska et al., 1995; Voegborlo et al., 1999) are simi-
lar to the present results, although lower than 0.7 mg kg?1. In the case of eel,
an interval between 0.12 and 0.19 mg kg?1 with a mean of 0.16 mg kg?1 was
found. Such values are in accordance with those published by Edwards et al.
(1999) (0.102-0.260 mg kg?1) and by Noirfalise and Fouassin (1981) (? 0.24
mg kg?1) for the same species.

Total Hg levels detected in canned cephalopods were lower than 0.5 mg
kg?1 (limit recommended by EU) in all samples studied, which is in agree-
ment with values reported by other authors (Falandysz, 1989; Falandysz,
1990; Storeli and Marcotrigiano, 1999). For chub mackerel the range was be-
tween 0.01 and 0.18 mg kg?1 closer to those found by Storeli et al. (1998) in
fish caught off the Adriatic Sea. Samples of canned sardine, sardine spread
and blue mussels presented the smallest values in this work. These low levels
are usual in this kind of species and are in good coherence with results ob-
tained by Tariq et al. (1991) and I-de et al. (1994). Nevertheless, some authors

Lourenço et al. 119



(Joiris et al., 1999) found higher levels for sardine species. This can be due to
the fact that these studies were performed with specimens resident in the Med-
iterranean, in which the process of bioaccumulation is more evident than in
Atlantic species (Baldi et al., 1978; Renzoni et al., 1998).

In order to make illustrate the distribution of mercury levels of the most rel-
evant canned seafood commercialized in Portugal, namely tuna, sardine and
chub mackerel, all values are presented in the histograms (relative frequency
of total mercury, in percentage) shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3. The levels, ex-
pressed in mg kg?1 wet weight, were clustered in several classes, indicating a
range of concentrations [higher or equal to, and lower than]. Of the 425 sam-
ples of canned tuna fish analyzed (Figure 1), only one reached the EU limit (1
mg kg?1) (EU, 2002). The majority of samples showed mercury levels be-
tween 0.10 and 0.40 mg kg?1, being the higher relative frequency presented
by class 0.20-0.30 mg kg?1. Such distribution was similar to that found by
several authors for this kind of product (Duve, 1981; Krueger and Kruse,
1984; Schindler, 1985; Gajewwska et al., 1995; Voegborlo et al., 1999).

All canned sardine samples (Figure 2) showed levels below the EU limit for this
species (0.5 mg kg?1). Major relative frequency was exhibited by class 0.02-0.04,
and only 3.2% of samples had concentrations higher than 0.08 mg kg?1. The distri-
bution in canned chub mackerel (Figure 3) is similar to that found for canned sar-
dine; however, a higher number of samples (25.4%) displayed upper levels.

The levels of cadmium are presented in Table 2. The maximum mean con-
centrations were found in canned molluscs (0.29 mg kg?1 for squid and 0.16

mg kg?1 for blue mussels) and the range was between 0.02 and 1.10 mg kg?1.
Cisneros et al. (1995) indicated similar mean values for canned squid. Some
samples of canned squid (18.5%) exceeded the EU limit (1.0 mg kg?1) pro-
posed for this species (EU, 2001). These high levels can be attributed to the
presence of visceral tissue in this canned seafood (Falandysz, 1989; I-de et al.,
1994; Shulz-Schroeder and Schering, 1995). Values of Cd found by Schindler
(1985) in canned mussels (0.30 mg kg?1) are higher; however, the range is
similar. Lowest contents were presented by canned chub mackerel, spreads
and eel samples; regarding canned tuna, in spite of one sample exceeding the
EU limit (0.05 mg kg?1), the concentrations obtained in this work were lower
than that found by Voegborlo et al. (1999).

Lead was only detected in 120 samples of 526 analyzed; however, the max-
imum levels obtained, 0.1 mg kg?1 (tuna), 0.2 mg kg?1 (sardine) and 0.3 mg
kg?1 (blue mussels), were below the permitted limits (0.4, 0.4 and 1.5 mg
kg?1, respectively) (EU, 2002). Studies performed in earlier years (Schindler,
1984; Hardisson et al., 1985; Romieu et al., 1994) showed mean levels greater
than 2 mg kg?1 in some cases. These Pb high concentrations can be explained
by the use of lead soldered side seam in cans.

CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, this study indicates that canned fish follows a pattern Hg &gt;
Cd &gt; Pb while canned molluscs show a profile Cd &gt; Hg ? Pb. All values were
lower than those found by other authors. Although high contents of mercury in
fresh tuna are a concern, the present study showed the prevalence of levels be-
tween 0.1 and 0.4 mg kg?1 in canned product. Such fact is probably due to the
utilization of small size fish and, moreover, the seafood industry selecting fish
caught in less polluted areas. In reference to concerns about cadmium levels in
canned molluscs like squid, in which 18.5% of samples tested exceeded 1 mg
kg?1, the major problem seems to be the utilization of whole body.

Taking into account the type of consumption of these products it can be
concluded that canned seafood products do not represent a risk in terms of hu-
man diet.
