quality: low calorific value and high ash (47 to 58%) 
and sulfur (1 to 4.7%) contents (JICA, 1995).

The main activities of coal mining (exploration, 
development, extraction, concentration, processing, 
refinement and deactivation) have a variety of 
impacts, which include soil damage, air pollution 
and water contamination (McAllister and Milioli, 
2000). Areas that have been explored but not 
rehabilitated are a source of water pollution. This 
is mainly because of acid mine drainage (AMD), 
due to pyrite oxidation (FeS2). When pyrite is in 
contact with oxygen and water, highly concentrated 

1. Introduction

The impact of coal mining activity on the 
environment is of great concern, especially due to 
acidification of surface water bodies. Hence, mining 
requires complex planning that takes into account 
the specificity of techniques and characteristics of 
the affected environment (Kopezinski, 2000).

Currently, thermal energy is responsible for 5% 
of energy matrix in Brazil. However, the government 
aims to increase this ratio to 15% by 2015. Rio 
Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina states account 
for 99% of known coal reserves, approximately 32 
billion tons. Coal found in these states is of low

Abstract: Aim: To assess water quality of three lakes located in an abandoned 
coal mining area, in the Morozini River basin (Treviso, Santa Catarina State, Brazil). 
Methods: The study sites were three lakes mining pits flooded after deactivation, near 
the drainage basin of the Morozini River (Treviso City, Santa Catarina State, Brazil). 
Samplings were carried out in profile in the limnetic region during two seasons (Summer 
in February and Winter in July). Results: In general, the three lakes showed high 
concentrations of SO4

–2, Mg, Fe, Al, Ca, Ba, Si, Zn, Ni, Na, K, Sr, B, Cd, Cr, Pb and Cu. 
Conclusions: Coal mining activity and waste disposal practices adopted by the mining 
companies in the Morozini River basin have drastically affected the water quality of the 
examined lakes and made them inappropriate for diverse human uses, such as leisure, 
swimming and fishing.

Open-pit mining in this region began in 
1982 and the resulting deposits have high sulfate 
concentration that reduces the pH in shallow lakes. 
The course of the Morozini River was modified 
many times due to surface coal mining, and, as final 
conformation, the river water flows through the 
mining pits that were dug by a Marion dragline. The 
pyrite waste was used to make gravel access roads 
to the mines. Many lakes near coalmines were used 
as dumps for the mining waste. Lakes have been 
formed in this region by the flow of underground 
and surface water into the mining pits (Waterloo, 
2002). In the study area, at present, there is no 
more coal exploration and the lakes studied do not 
receive mining waste.

Climate type is wet subtropical with hot summer 
(Cfa - Köppen’s classification). Mean annual 
temperature is 19 °C and total precipitation haste 
is 1600  mm, distributed along the whole year, 
without well defined dry season. Mean monthly 
temperature varies from 15  °C in the winter to 
24  °C in summer, with possible incident of frost 
(Sônego et al., 2011). According to these authors, 
from March to September, there is predominance 
of hot air mass and moisture, causing strong heating 
during the days and formation of convective clouds. 
During the winter months, there is predominance 
of cold and dry polar air mass. For the series of 10 
years (Figure  2), one can observe marked annual 
pattern of temperature, with lower values   from 

sulfuric acid is produced which solves metals (Rose 
and Cravotta, 1998; Asta et al., 2008).

The main objective of this work was to assess the 
water quality of three lakes situated in an abandoned 
coal mining area, submitted to anthropogenic 
impacts. It is expected that these lakes have strong 
use restriction, according to the Brazilian water 
quality regulation (CONAMA nº 357/2005).

2. Study Area

The study region, is located in the south region 
of Santa Catarina State (Brazil), and has an area 
of 9,049  km2, 9.8% of the total area of the state 
(Figure  1); it has 39 towns and a population of 
more than 800,000 inhabitants. The studied lakes 
are located in the Morozini River micro basin, near 
the Treviso city. Morozini River micro basin is a 
tributary of the Mãe Luzia River and is located in a 
4,200 m (large axis) by 3,400 m (small axis) valley, 
with a topographical gradient of about 320 m.

The Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional (CSN), 
established in the 1950s, is a company that explored 
and processed coal in the region. In the 1960s, coal 
mining was intensified closer to Treviso and became 
one of the most important economic activities. 
However, mining adversely affected other economic 
activities and also had social and environmental 
consequences causing a high level of pollution and 
reducing the water quality (Milioli, 1999).

water was acidified with HNO3 (1  mL) and 
maintained in polythene vials protected from light 
until analysis.

Principal components analysis (PCA) was 
carried out to identify possible relationships among 
lakes, depth and season. The analysis was based on 
a product-moment matrix obtained from a range-
standardized matrix (Legendre and Legendre, 
2003). The physical and chemical variables selected 
for the PCA were temperature (t), total solids (TS), 
calcium (Ca), aluminum (Al), silicon (Si), iron (Fe), 
zinc (Zn), nickel (Ni), pH, electric conductivity 
(EC) and dissolved oxygen (DO).

4. Results

Water from Lakes 1 and 2 were micro stratified 
during summer, and temperatures ranged from 27.2 
to 31.1 °C. Water column of Lake 3 was relatively 
homogeneous in the summer, with temperature 

May to October. In 2003, when this research was 
developed, the total precipitation was 1509.8 mm; 
annual mean minimum temperature was 15.4 °C 
and annual mean maximum temperature of 
20.0 °C.

3. Material and Methods

The study sites consisted of 3 lakes, mining pits 
flooded after deactivation, near the drainage basin 
of the Morozini River (Treviso, Santa Catarina 
State, Brazil) (Figure 1). Samplings were carried out 
considering a profile through the limnetic region in 
two seasons (summer, the month of February, and 
winter, the month of July, 2003).

Physical and chemical variables of the water 
were analyzed (Table 1). To analyze the total and 
dissolved nutrients concentration, water samples 
were collected and filtered in  situ through a 
Whatman GF/C 47  mm membrane. The filtered

and Lake 2, 3.72 mg.L–1). A different pattern was 
observed in winter, when an orthograde profile 
was found with DO values greater than 6 mg.L–1 
(Figure  3d). Lakes 1 and 2 showed higher TS 
concentrations (982.5 to 1161.5 mg.L–1) than Lake 
3 (mean 230.6 mg.L–1) (Figure 3e). Most part of TS 
was in the dissolved form (Table 2).

SO4
–2, Ca, Mg and K concentrations were higher 

in Lakes 1 and 2 than in Lake 3. SO4
–2 concentration 

ranged from 505 to 676 mg.L–1 in Lakes 1 and 2, 
and from 93 to 111 mg.L–1 in Lake 3 (Figure 4a). 
Values for Ca concentration ranged from 177 to 
213  mg.L–1 in Lakes 1 and 2, and from 5.9 to 
8.7 mg.L–1 in Lake 3 (Figure 4b). Mg concentration 
ranged from 28 to 34 mg.L–1 in Lakes 1 and 2, and 
from 2.4 to 3.4  mg.L–1 in Lake 3 (Figure  4c). In 
Lakes 1 and 2, Na and K concentrations ranged 
from 5.6 to 6.1 mg.L–1 and 3.5 to 4.2 mg.L–1, in 

ranging from 24.5 and 31.1 °C. In the winter, none 
of the lakes was stratified, and temperatures were 
around 19 °C (Figure 3a).

In Lake 2, pH increased with depth and values 
were 5.1 at the surface and 6.2 at the bottom, while 
the highest pH value was found at the surface (6.9) 
and at the bottom was 6.4 in the winter. The pH 
value for Lake 3 was approximately 3 (Figure 3b). 
Lake 1 showed a pH ranging from 7.3 (epilimnion) 
to 5.7 (hypolimnion) in the summer and from 6.3 
(surface) to 7.4 (bottom) in the winter.

EC values were high (700 to 900  µS.cm–1) in 
Lakes 1 and 2 in both periods and tended to increase 
from epilimnion downwards to hypolimnion in the 
summer but were relatively homogeneous in winter 
(Figure 3c). Lower EC values (about 300 µS.cm–1) 
were measured in Lake 3 in both periods.

In the summer, there was a decrease of DO 
from epilimnion (Lake 1, 7.23 mg.L–1 and Lake 2,

Low Fe concentrations were observed in Lake 1 
during the winter (0.05 to 0.15 mg.L–1). Generally 
the values ranged from 0.30 to 1.28 mg.L–1, except

thermally homogeneous. This fact is probably due 
to depth differences between the lakes combined 
with the effect of the wind and also it can be 
related to the air temperature seasonal pattern 
observed in the region. Therefore, the differences 
observed between winter and summer for Lakes 1 
and 2 could be explained by the marked pattern of 
temperature observed along the year in the study 
region (Figure 7). For Lake 3, the similarity among 
sampling periods, probably, is associated with the 
low depth, allowing wind action and constant water 
column mix.

The profiles of DO that were measured in the 
lakes also corroborated the hypothesis of chemical 
stratification in Lakes 1 and 2 and homogeneity in 

Relevant factor loadings for the second axis were 
Zn, Fe and Si in opposition (negatively correlated) 
with pH and dissolved oxygen. A space effect was 
observed with Lake 3 apart from Lakes 1 and 2. Lake 
3 presented higher Al concentration and lower Ca, 
pH and EC values in both studied periods. Despite 
lakes 1 and 2 presented small differences for the 
same season, the biggest differences observed for 
theses lakes were observed between the sampling 
periods (summer and winter).

5. Discussion

Water column was thermally homogeneous in 
all the lakes in winter. In summer, Lakes 1 and 2 
showed micro stratifications, whereas Lake 3 was

consequence of the lower concentration of SO4
–2, 

Ca, Mg, Na and K.
CSN Company is responsible for coal mining 

in this region and it is also in charge of the recovery 
of affected lakes. In the past Ca(OH)2 was added 
to the Lakes 1 and 2 in order to increase their pH. 
However, SO4

–2, Ca, Mg and Fe concentration 
remained high. In appropriate concentrations, 
these ions are important for the metabolism of 
various organisms, but they can cause toxic effects at 
higher concentrations. It is important to emphasize 
that water neutralization does not directly affect 
the causes of the acidity. Additionally, water 
neutralization can increase turbidity, which becomes 
then a new environmental problem.

The high concentration of SO4
–2 and Ca in 

Lakes 1 and 2 can be explained by the addition of 

Lake 3, in this case, like observed in two sampling 
periods. Low DO concentration in the deepest 
parts of Lake 1 in the summer is probably due to 
the consumption of oxygen in oxidation of pyrite, 
a process that results in dissolution of certain ions 
and metals such as SO4

–2, Fe, Mn, Zn and Ni 
(Blunden et al., 2001).

Data obtained in the winter showed that most 
of the solid fraction in all three lakes is in dissolved 
form, SO4

–2 and Ca, mainly, and that the particulate 
matter accounts for only a small part of the TS.

The high EC values for Lakes 1 and 2 are 
probably due to the high ion concentration, 
especially SO4

–2 (above 500 mg.L–1) and Ca (higher 
than 180 mg.L–1) that also contribute to high TS 
values. In Lake 3, the lowest values of EC may be a

Impact of coal mining on water quality...

and the waste was considered responsible for the 
properties of surface and subterranean water in 
the Morozini mining field. The results of Waterloo 
(op  cit.) are similar to those found in this study. 
However, our study found much lower pH values, 
which can be partly explained by the addition of 
Ca(OH)2 in Lakes 1 and 2 after Waterloo’s study.

The most extreme changes in water quality found 
by Waterloo (2002) were for the subterranean water 
(pH approximately 4.0; sulfate  &gt;  1000  mg.L–1, 
Fe &gt; 100 mg.L–1). This author concludes that the 
higher pH values are due to the flow of oxidized 
SO4

–2 from the pyrite in the mining debris and also 
as a by-product of secondary reactions involving Fe 
in anaerobic conditions.

The Brazilian legislation, in accordance with 
CONAMA Resolution 357 (Brasil, 2005), 
classifies water quality in order to assess the 
environmental quality of lakes and ponds. The 
CONAMA Resolution also defines proper water 
use, according to the biological, chemical and 
physical characteristics of each class. Five freshwater 
classes have been defined for typical use and human 
consumption. The Special Class, represent the water 
crud used in the water supply after disinfection 
(more restrictive use), and the Class 1 to 4. Class 
4 is to use less restrictive, such as navigation and 
harmonious landscape.

The lakes in our study had a range of chemical 
and physical characteristics, which show that the 
water quality was seriously affected. For some 
variables, these lakes failed to meet the necessary 
criteria for classification standards (Table 4). Based 
on the values found in the superficial water, the Lakes 

Ca(OH)2, which increases the water solubility of 
these ions. A high SO4

–2 concentration was found 
by Silvano and Raya-Rodriguez (2003) in Lagoa 
Azul, a lake located close to the site of this study, in 
the coal-producing basin of Siderópolis city. These 
authors attributed this condition to the oxidation 
of pyrite from coal mining.

Data of pH, EC, TS, SO4
-2, Ca Mg, Na, K, 

Al, and Sr, mainly in the Lake 3, indicate that 
coal mining has made a strong environmental 
impact. Lakes 1 and 2 discriminated from Lake 
3, mainly because the last was strongly affected 
by the coal mining, due a CSN intervention with 
the addition of Ca(OH)2. However, all three lakes 
remain exposed to high pyrite content and are, 
consequently, highly affected by the coal mining 
process.

Previous studies carried out in the basins of 
Rivers Conde, Ratos and Porteira (Rio Grande 
do Sul state, Brazil) registered mean pH values 
of about 6.0. Extreme values of 2.6 and 2.7 were 
found in some locations probably due to the impact 
of mining on the drainage basin. Low pH values 
in areas where coal mining takes place are often 
due to nearby pyrite deposits (Zanardi Junior and 
Porto, 1991).

The highest aluminium concentrations observed 
in Lake 3 are probably due to the lower pH values, 
which increase Al solubility. The concentration of 
Al in freshwater around the world varies according 
to pH values. Al concentrations are higher when 
pH is low (Siegfried et al., 1989). In the Pantano 
Lake, a pH of around 3.9 was associated with Al 
concentrations of 0.1 to 3.7 mg.L–1 (Courtijn et al., 
1987 apud Azevedo and Chasin, 2003). Lake Shield 
(Ontario and Quebec, Canada) showed pH values 
ranging from 4.4 to 7.1 and Al concentrations 
ranging from 0.05 to 0.37 mg.L–1. Lake Ipê (Parana 
State, Brazil), an area relatively untouched by 
mankind, has low Al concentrations ranging from 
8 to 21 µg.L–1 (Barreto et al., 2005). In this study, 
Al concentrations are higher than those mentioned 
above.

Similar SO4
–2, Fe, Al and Mg concentrations 

found in Morozini River lakes also were found in 
lakes of the Fiorita River basin (Siderópolis City, 
Santa Catarina State, Brazil) (Pompêo et al., 2004). 
These lakes in Fiorita River basin also are located 
in abandoned coal mining area, explored with the 
same procedures practiced in the Morozini River.

In a previous study in the lakes located in 
Morozini River basin, Waterloo (2002) stated that 
the lakes were used as dumps for coal mining waste,

1 and 2 are in accordance to Class 4, and the Lake 
3 in Class 3, according to CONAMA Resolution. 
According to our suggested classification, Lakes 
1 and 2 should have their uses strictly limited to 
navigation and landscaping (Class 4) and Lake 3 
should only supply water for human consumption 
after conventional or advanced treatment (Class 3).

6. Conclusions

Coal mining activity and waste disposal 
practices adopted by the mining companies in the 
Morozini River basin, has drastically affected the 
water quality of the examined water bodies and 
left them inappropriate for human use apart from 
landscaping. Immediate intervention is necessary 
because the local population uses the lakes for 
leisure, swimming and fishing.
