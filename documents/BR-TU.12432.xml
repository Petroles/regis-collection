SUMMARY

Although the influence of clay mineralogy on soil physical properties has been

widely studied, spatial relationships between these features in Alfisols have rarely

been examined. The purpose of this work was to relate the clay minerals and

physical properties of an Alfisol of sandstone origin in two slope curvatures. The

crystallographic properties such as mean crystallite size (MCS) and width at half

height (WHH) of hematite, goethite, kaolinite and gibbsite; contents of hematite

and goethite; aluminium substitution (AS) and specific surface area (SSA) of

hematite and goethite; the goethite/(goethite+hematite) and kaolinite/

(kaolinite+gibbsite) ratios; and the citrate/bicarbonate/dithionite extractable Fe

(Fed) were correlated with the soil physical properties through Pearson correlation

coefficients and cross-semivariograms. The correlations found between aluminium

substitution in goethite and the soil physical properties suggest that the degree of

crystallinity of this mineral influences soil properties used as soil quality indicators.

Thus, goethite with a high aluminium substitution resulted in large aggregate sizes

and a high porosity, and also in a low bulk density and soil penetration resistance.

The presence of highly crystalline gibbsite resulted in a high density and micropore

content, as well as in smaller aggregates. Interpretation of the cross-semivariogram

and classification of landscape compartments in terms of the spatial dependence

pattern for the relief-dependent physical and mineralogical properties of the soil

proved an effective supplementary method for assessing Pearson correlations

between the soil physical and mineralogical properties.

Index terms: aggregates, mineral crystallinity, density, porosity, penetration

resistance, cross-semivariogram.

RESUMO: MINERALOGIA DA FRAÇÃO ARGILA DE UM ARGISSOLO EM
CURVATURAS DO RELEVO. II - CORRELAÇÃO ESPECIAL COM
ATRIBUTOS FÍSICOS

A influência da mineralogia da fração argila nos atributos físicos do solo é reportada na
literatura; porém, as relações espaciais entre esses atributos são escassas em se tratando de
Argissolos. O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a correlação espacial entre os minerais da
fração argila e atributos físicos de um Argissolo de origem arenítica. Os atributos mineralógicos
como diâmetro médio do cristal (DMC); largura à meia altura (LMA) dos minerais hematita,
goethita, caulinita e gibbsita; teor; substituição isomórfica (SI); área de superfície específica
(ASE) dos minerais hematita e goethita; razão goethita/(goethita+hematita); e razão caulinita/
(caulinita+gibbsita) foram correlacionados com os atributos físicos por meio da correlação
simples de Pearson e dos semivariogramas cruzados entre esses atributos. As relações
encontradas entre a substituição isomórfica da goethita e os atributos físicos do solo permitiram
inferir sobre o efeito da cristalinidade desse mineral nos atributos físicos do solo. Goethitas
com altos valores de substituição isomórfica favoreceram a dimensão dos agregados e da
porosidade; o contrário ocorreu com a densidade do solo (Ds) e resistência a penetração (RP).
Gibbsitas de maior grau de cristalinidade favoreceram os maiores valores de densidade do
solo e RP.

Termos de indexação: óxidos de ferro, caulinita, gibbsita, densidade, agregados, semivariograma
cruzado.

INTRODUCTION

The importance of clay mineralogy for the
maintenance of the soil physical quality has been
recognized for a long time, especially in soils with low
organic matter content, which are typical of tropical
regions (Six et al., 2002; Duiker et al., 2003; Igwe et
al., 2009; McBride et al., 2012). In fact, a number of
early studies report a favorable effect of iron (Fe)
oxides on the clay fraction and on the soil physical
properties (Lutz, 1936; Kroth &amp;amp; Page, 1947; Chesters
et al., 1957; Blackmore, 1973; Schwertmann &amp;amp;
Kämpf, 1985; Igwe et al., 1995, 2009; Camargo et
al., 2008b), but some reported no such effect
(Desphande et al., 1968; Borggaard, 1983). According
to Duiker et al. (2003), the absence of correlation
between the Fe oxyhydroxides contents and soil
aggregation may result from the weaker influence
of these contents than of crystallinity. Thus,
according to Azevedo &amp;amp; Bonumá (2004), poorly
crystalline oxides act as cementing agents facilitating
soil aggregation. Anda et al. (2008) and Camargo et
al. (2008a) also found that low crystallinity of clay
minerals in Oxisols had a positive impact on soil
aggregation.

The minerals kaolinite and gibbsite are correlated
with soil physical properties such as density and
permeability, as well as with the integrity of soil
aggregates (Pinheiro-Dick &amp;amp; Schwertmann, 1996;
Ferreira et al., 1999; Schaefer, 2001; Pedrotti et al.,
2003; Camargo et al., 2008b). Silicon- mediated
kaolinite can enhance the aggregating effect of oxides
in soil (Cambier &amp;amp; Picot, 1988).

However, first studies mostly focused on soils with
high Fe contents, such as Oxisols, and had to be

extended to soils with low Fe levels. Also, all studies
used classical statistical techniques such as simple
correlations or associations.

Correlations between soil properties can be derived
from cross-semivariograms, which allow a
determination of the structure of spatial dependence
of one property based on others. By using this
technique, Paz-González et al. (2000) identified
differences in spatial correlations between organic
matter and cation-exchange capacity, both in
agricultural soils and soils under natural vegetation.
Camargo et al. (2008b) used a cross-correlation
method to examine the relationship between
mineralogy and physical properties under the influence
of landscape, and found a negative spatial correlation
between the crystallinity of clay minerals and
aggregate stability and size. According to Camargo et
al. (2008a) and Souza et al. (2009), relief influences
clay mineralogy and physical properties, and hence
their spatial distribution in the landscape. This
justifies the use of geostatistics to investigate their
mutual relationships.

Recently, the relationship between clay mineralogy
and soil physical properties has been used to explain
soil erosion. For this purpose, understanding soil
degradation requires studies of spatial relationships
between clay mineralogy and soil physical
properties. These relationships allow the prediction
of the spatial distribution of physical soil properties,
e.g., of soil aggregates (Camargo et al., 2008b), and
to optimize soil sampling and management
strategies Another important aspect is the role of
mineralogy and aggregate stability in the dynamics
of soil organic carbon; according to Rasmussen et
al. (2005), these are the key properties governing

the dynamics of carbon and its implications on
climate change.

The objective of this study was to spatially
correlate the crystallinity properties of the clay
minerals goethite, hematite, kaolinite, and gibbsite,
and the physical properties of Alfisols in slope
curvatures.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Study area

The study area was located in the municipality of
Catanduva, in the north–west of the state of São Paulo,
Brazil, (latitude 21o 05' 57.11" S, longitude 49o 01'
02.08" W, 503 m a.l.s.). The Aw climate (Köppen
classification) of the region is hot humid, tropical, with
dry winters, a mean annual rainfall of 1,350 mm, a
mean annual temperature of 23 oC, a mean maximum
and minimum temperature of 22 and 18 oC,
respectively, and with a relative air humidity of
74 %. The primary vegetation is seasonal rain forest
and Cerrado (Brazilian savannah). The current main
land use is for sugarcane plantations with a green
harvesting system (practice of cane burning and
cutting when still green), in use for over 20 years.

The soil parent material is sandstone from the
Bauru Group in the Adamantina Formation (IPT,
1981). This formation contains refined sediments
(Almeida et al., 1980) and Si-rich and Fe-poor minerals
(Suguio, 1973).

The area was characterized by aerial photography
at a 1:35,000 scale, with topographic profiling and
geomorphological and pedological field classification.
The soil was classified as Typic Hapludalf (Soil Survey
Staff, 1999) (Table 1). The slope curvatures were
classified based on field measurements according to
Troeh (1965), using an elaborate digital elevation
model (DEM) (Figure 1). Two different morphological
areas were observed: one with convex and the other
with concave slope curvatures.

Soil samples were collected from the 0.0-0.2 m
layer at intersection points on a 100 × 100 m
georeferenced grid, consisting of regularly spaced
nodes (10 x 10 m) at a representative location of each
area.

Clay mineralogy and soil physical properties

Iron oxides were removed from the clay fraction
by extraction with dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate (DCB)
according to Mehra &amp;amp; Jackson (1960) and analysed
for kaolinite (Kt) and gibbsite (Gb). Iron oxides were
determined by previously concentrating the clay
fraction with iron oxides, using the method of Norrish
&amp;amp; Taylor (1961), modified by Kämpf &amp;amp; Schwertmann
(1982). X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained, using
an equipment with a cobalt anode and an iron filter
for hematite (Hm) and goethite (Gt) diffractions, and
a copper anode and a nickel filter for Kt and Gb
diffractions (K? radiation, 20 mA, 30 kV). A scanning
speed of 1o 2? per min, and an amplitude of 23-49o for
hematite (012 and 110) and goethite (110 and 111),
and 11-19o for kaolinite (001) and gibbsite (002), were
used.

Tables 2 and 3 show the mean values of the clay
mineralogical and physical properties in the concave
and convex areas. A more detailed description of the
method used to characterize the physical and
mineralogical properties was given by Camargo et al.
(2010) and Camargo et al. (2013a), respectively.

Separated materials and stable aggregates were
determined by the method of Kemper &amp;amp; Chepil
(1965). The aggregates retained on the 4.76 mm
sieve were subjected to slow pre-wetting by
atomization with distilled water and then mixed for
15 min in a set of sieves (2.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125,
and 0.105 mm mesh size) in a water-filled container.
The results of the stable aggregate analyses were
used to calculate the mean geometric diameter
(MGD) and mean weighted diameter (MWD). In
order to determine soil porosity (total porosity,
macropores and micropores), undisturbed samples
were saturated for 48 h in a tray filled with water

up to two-thirds of the height of the soil ring. After
saturation, the samples were drained at an
equivalent potential to -0.006 MPa on a tension table
(Embrapa, 1997). These samples were also used to
determine bulk density (Bd) with the volumetric ring
method of Embrapa (1997), and moisture. The soil
penetration resistance was determined in the field,
using an IAA/Planalsucar impact penetrometer at
each grid point and processing measurements
according to Stolf (1991).

Statistical analyses

The correlation between soil properties was studied
based on Pearson correlation coefficients and spatial
correlation by cross-semivariograms for the specific
variables with spatial dependence (Camargo et al.,
2010, 2013a). Correlations were positive when the
increase in one property caused an increase in the
others and negative if an increase in one led to a
decrease in the others (Bhatti et al., 1991; Ceddia et
al., 2009; Camargo et al., 2013b). The geostatistical
analysis was performed with software GS+ (Gamma
Design Software, 1998).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Tables 4 and 5 show the results of the Pearson
correlation analysis between the soil physical and
mineralogical properties in the convex and concave
areas. An increased Al substitution (AS) in goethite
(Gt) was positively correlated with larger aggregates
and macropores, and had an opposite effect on
microporosity, bulk density (Bd) and soil penetration
resistance (SPR). This was a result of increased Fe-
for-Al substitution in the Gt structure, causing
contraction of the unit cell by decreasing the crystallite
size and hence the crystallinity of Gt (Norrish &amp;amp;
Taylor, 1961; Schwertmann &amp;amp; Carlson, 1994; Friedl
&amp;amp; Schwertmann, 1996).

The increased specific surface area (SSA) resulting
from the decreased crystallinity, which provides
functional groups facilitating interactions between
particles (Cornell &amp;amp; Schwertmann, 1996) and retention
of soil carbon (Anda et al., 2008), led to more stable
aggregates.

Thus, Gt with high Al substitution probably
increases aggregation in soil particles and
consequently the number of macropores, which
explains the negative effect on soil Bd and SPR (Table
2). Schahabi &amp;amp; Schwertmann (1970) and Blackmore
(1973) found a direct relationship between poorly
crystalline synthetic goethites and aggregate stability.
Duiker et al. (2003) and Igwe et al. (2009) previously
found that poorly crystalline Fe oxides were the agents
contributing most to aggregation in soils with low OM
content (Table 1). The positive relationship between
1-2 mm aggregates and AS of Hm in the concave area
had the same trends as observed for SI of Gt.

The negative correlation between citrate-
bicarbonate-dithionite extractable Fe (Fed) and the
mean geometric diameter (MGD) was significant. This
was expected since Fed is a measure of the content of
crystalline iron oxides (Table 4). Similar results were
previously obtained by Ghidin et al. (2006). WHH for
gibbsite (Gb) had a positive effect on 1-2 mm
aggregates, similarly to MCD for Gb on Bd. The
positive correlation between the Kt/(Kt + Gb) ratio
and micropores confirms the positive effect of Kt on
the smaller aggregates and stability, consistent with
previous results of Ferreira et al. (1999), Schaefer
(2001) and Vitorino et al. (2003). According to Mbagwu
&amp;amp; Schwertmann (2006), Al oxides are more effective
than Fe oxides for aggregation in some tropical soils.

Spatial correlation was determined by constructing
a cross-semivariogram between the spatially dependent
physical and mineralogical properties (Figure 2).
Physical properties were used as main variables and
mineralogical properties as auxiliary variables to
assess the influence of clay mineralogy on soil physical
properties.

Only in the convex area the soil physical properties
were spatially dependent on the secondary variable

(mineralogical properties). Although some physical
and mineralogical properties in the concave area were
spatially dependent (Camargo et al., 2010; 2013a),
there was no spatial correlation between them. This
was a result of most of the physical properties in the
concave area without spatial dependence. Possibly,
the increased spatial variability in physical and
mineralogical properties in the concave area
precluded the identification of spatial correlations
between these properties, while the presence of other
factors influenced the spatial distribution of physical
properties to the detriment of mineralogical
properties.

The spatially dependent properties included

and MWD × Hm content (Figure 2). The models fitting
the cross-semivariograms best were gaussian or
spherical. The nugget effects of the cross-
semivariograms for the physical properties were
smaller than of the simple semivariograms for the
same properties (Camargo et al., 2010, 2013a),

The spatial correlations for aggregates&amp;lt;1
mm × Fed and micropores × Fed in the cross-
semivariograms were positive. This was also the case
for Bd and MCD with Gb, with significant simple
correlation. The spatial correlations for cross-

also had positive spatial correlations.

and poorly crystalline Al forms were more closely
associated with physical properties, mainly with those
related to soil particle aggregation, which explains
the relationship observed in this study. Note that
WHH for Gb was negatively correlated with
aggregates&amp;lt;1 mm. This result illustrates the
influence of Gb crystallinity in some soils, repeating
that of Gt, as confirmed by the Pearson correlation
coefficients.

The spatial correlation analysis also revealed a
positive correlation of the Hm content with MWD and
negative correlation with SPR, resulting from the
higher levels of Hm than of Gt.



MINERALOGY OF THE CLAY FRACTION OF ALFISOLS IN TWO... IV - SPATIAL CORRELATION...       313

R. Bras. Ci. Solo, 37:307-316, 2013

The influence of mineralogical properties on physical
properties could only be assessed in the convex area,
despite the intensive management practices typical of
mechanized sugarcane cultivation in this area. In fact,
although physical properties can easily be modified by
soil management, the separation of landscape
compartments, based on the spatial dependence pattern
of the relief-dependent physical and mineralogical
properties, allows the identification of relationships
between these properties. This assessment technique
increases the predictive ability for properties used as
indicators of soil physical quality and to optimize soil
sampling and management strategies.

CONCLUSIONS

1. The correlations found between the aluminium
substitution of goethite (Gt) and soil physical properties
suggest that Gt crystallinity affects physical
properties, reflecting the soil quality. Thus, goethite
with high aluminium substitution increases
aggregate size and porosity, and decreases bulk
density and soil penetration resistance.

2. Aluminium substitution of Gt and gibbsite
crystallinity were the most relevant properties for the
maintenance of the soil physical/structural quality,
even in soils with low Fe levels and high proportions
of kaolinite.

3. Analyzing the cross-semivariogram and
separating landscape compartments via the spatial
dependence pattern for relief-dependent physical and
mineralogical properties can be an effective
supplementary tool for assessing Pearson’s correlation
coefficient between the soil physical and mineralogical
properties.
