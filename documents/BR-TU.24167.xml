Abstract

The geological modeling of stratiform deposits can become very complex, often 
making use of geological envelopes of small thickness and requiring the use of sub-
blocks (based on Cartesian coordinates) to produce a coherent block model. However, 
geological events after the formation of the deposit (folds, faults, etc.) can change the 
direction of spatial continuity of certain attributes, with the mixing of samples belong-
ing to different formation eras (in the case of stratiform deposits) in the same elevation. 
This study presents a solution for deposits with stratigraphic grades combined with 
samples of different origins. The solution is a two-dimensional estimate obtained by 
accumulating the thicknesses of P

Resumo

A modelagem geológica de depósitos estratiformes pode-se tornar muito com-
plexa, muitas vezes fazendo uso de envelopes geológicos de pequena espessura e 
exigindo o uso de sub-blocos (com base em coordenadas cartesianas) para produzir 
um modelo de blocos coerente. No entanto, eventos geológicos após a formação do 
depósito (dobras, falhas, etc.) podem mudar a direção da continuidade espacial de 
certos atributos, com mistura de amostras pertencentes a épocas de formação geoló-
gicas diferentes (no caso de depósitos estratiformes) na mesma elevação. Esse estudo 
apresenta uma solução para depósitos com teores estratigráficos combinados com 
amostras de diferentes origens. A solução é uma estimativa bidimensional obtida pela 
acumulação da espessura de P

1. Introduction

T he est i mate of a n at t ribute 
(grade, thickness, etc.) using geostatis-
tical data requires certain assumptions, 
and among them is the assumption that 
the attribute presents autocorrelation in 
time and/or space. These estimates are 
based on temporal/spatial continuity 
for the attribute, which in turn is based 
on the sample values of the attributed 
model. In many cases, the database 
is geo-positioned using a Cartesian 
coordinate system. However, the con-

tinuity of the phenomenon may not be 
compatible with this type of coordinate. 
At the time of formation of mineral de-
posits, the minerals are crystallized or 
deposited in positions consistent with 
an active geological process, and this 
process determines the continuity of at-
tributes related to the constitution of the 
rocks (e.g. mineral grades). Geological 
events subsequent to the formation of 
the deposit, such as folding, can change 
the direction of continuity of certain at-

tributes (Koppe et al., 2006). There are 
some ways around this issue, such as 
coordinate transformations (McArthur, 
1987; Deutsch, 2002) and accumulation 
in two dimensions (2D) (Krige, 1981).

In cases where one dimension is 
much smaller than the others (stratiform 
deposits), it is usual to use the accumula-
tion method of grades by the layer thick-
ness, where the estimate of the grades is 
obtained indirectly. This process cannot 
be considered a simplification because

The efect of accumulation in 2D estimates in phosphatic ore

it adds complexity to the estimation 
process. Besides requiring additional 
steps to obtain the final grades, it can 
generate inconsistencies if not executed 
properly, with, for example, extreme 
values exceeding the minimum and 
maximum grades of the original data. 

This article aims to present the 
steps in the estimation of a phosphatic 
deposit (P

2
O

5
) through the accumula-

tion process in 2D, showing all the 
necessary steps for its implementation. 
In addition, the reasons for choosing 
to perform the estimation in 2D rather 
than the conventional three dimensions 

(3D) are shown. The deposit studied 
had several layers of phosphatic ore 
interspersed with layers of waste rock. 

The positions of the Highwall and 
the Footwall were determined using 
data from drillholes. The results of the 
modeling showed almost horizontal 
layers, with a slight folding, and large 
variations in thickness

The determination of the spatial 
continuity of the deposit could be under-
mined by mixing samples of the same 
level (elevation), Z, belonging to a dif-
ferent geological formation era (distinct 
stratigraphic levels), correlating samples 

that may be on the Highwall in a drill-
hole at one given Z coordinate and on 
the Footwall in another drillhole at the 
same Z coordinate, as shown in Figure 
2(a) (holes A, B, C and D). In view of 
this, the unfolding (transformation of 
Cartesian coordinates to stratigraphic 
coordinates) of the deposit could be 
a way of improving the results of the 
analysis of spatial continuity, given 
that in deposits of sedimentary origin, 
the values from sediments of the same 
geological age (stratigraphically on the 
same horizon) tend to have high spatial 
correlation (Figure 1 (b)).

Figure 1. Theoretical example of 
how folds in the geological phenomenon 
(a) may affect the analysis of spatial 
continuity, and (b) how unfolding of 
the layer can reduce the problem. It can 
be noted in (a) that, independent of the 
orientation of the ellipsoid search of 
samples, those of the same geological 

era (1, 2 and 3) will be the same, if prop-
erly analyzed. After the transformation 
(b), samples of the same geological era 
(1, 2 and 3) have the same orientation 
and coordinates in the search plan.

Finally, in certain cases, the Eu-
clidean distance is an inadequate mea-
sure (as in the Figure 2) and should be 

replaced by, for example, a "curved" 
distance measurement in layers with 
folds (Dagbert et al. 1984).

To determine whether the study 
should be performed in 3D with sup-
port, or in 2D, accumulating grades 
by the thickness, the series of tests pre-
sented below were performed.

2. Methodology

The sample data from a drill-
ing campaign were obtained from 
d r i l l  c o r e s  o f  d i f f e r e n t  l e n g t h s  
(different bases). 

These data from distinct bases 
can be used for accurate geological 
modeling, but to estimate grades (from 
a statistical point of view) using them 
may create bias in the results.

The database provided for geo-

statistical modeling had a total of 1643 
samples in the layer of interest. Because 
of the characteristics of the mineral 
deposit, it was impossible to regularize 
the bases of the samples, i.e. setting all 
the samples to a constant length for 
geostatistical analysis. In addition, the 
database was composed of data from 
four drilling campaigns, each with 
specific goals and its own protocol for 

sample preparation, taking no account 
of a standard sample size, varying be-
tween 0.1 and 2.12 m. 

The bias created by the use of that 
data unmodified is shown in Table 1, 
where data for a drillhole obtained by 
the fourth drilling campaign is shown. 
Note that the layers adjoining the con-
tact region show a small sample thick-
ness (some with high grade).

Sample regularization usually in-
volves combining existing sample values; 
i.e. it is a procedure that involves numeri-
cal calculation of the weighted means of 
the grades in larger volumes than the 
original samples. Typically, such a com-
position is linear in nature, involving 
calculation of a weighted mean of adjacent 
samples uniformly over a greater length 
than a single sample length (Sinclair and 

Blackwell, 2002). Some of the common 
reasons for sample regularization are: to 
provide an equal basis (support) for geo-
statistical analysis, and reduce the number 
of extreme values and the variability that 
these values may cause.

There are several different methods 
for the regularization that can be used, 
depending on the nature of the mineraliza-
tion and type of mining process. Common 

regularization methods are: regularization 
by the height of the bench, regularization 
by constant length, and regularization by 
ore zone. 

The only method applicable (without 
breaking the samples into smaller inter-
vals) is the regularization method by ore 
zone. The result of this adjustment may 
be seen in Figure 3, where each sample 
represents a drillhole.

Figure 3
Histogram of the length

 of the sample of interest
after the regularization by ore zone.

After sampling regularization, it can 
be seen that there is a great variability in 

thickness. Thus, a sample set does not ex-
ist on the same basis, preventing a study in 

3D without bias, as seen in the theoretical 
example shown in Figure 4 and Table 2.

The efect of accumulation in 2D estimates in phosphatic ore

REM: R. Esc. Minas, Ouro Preto, 67(4), 431-437, oct. dec. | 2014

All possibilities were analyzed for 
correction of basis, to try to determine a 
method without bias, and the only pos-
sible solution found by this study was 
the accumulation of the database in 2D. 
The following steps were performed:

•	 accumulation	of	all	data	by	the	

length of the sample;
•	 analysis	 of	 spatial	 continuity	

of the accumulated variables and the 
length of the sample (thickness);

•	 definition	of	the	search	strategy	
for estimation;

•	 estimation	of	cumulative	and	

variable thickness;
•	 validation	of	estimates;
•	 de-accumulation;
•	 validation	of	the	results	of	the	

de-accumulation.

3. Accumulation

The regionalized variables (VRs) 
must be such that all linear combina-
tions of their values keep the same 
mean. If f(x) represents the grade of a 
sample, the sum of samples multiplied 
by their weight (in this example, the 
length of the sample), ?i?i*f(xi), is the 
arithmetic mean (1/n)*?if(xi), which 
must have the same mean grade (Journel 
and Huijbregts, 1978).

The process of regularization en-
sures that the sample regionalized vari-

ables have the same length and therefore 
the same basis, which is necessary for the 
implementation and use of geostatistical 
analysis. But in some cases, this is not 
enough (e.g. chemical variables associ-
ated with particle size fractions) or not 
applicable (e.g. small, thick layers of ore). 
In the case of a thin layer of iron ore, one 
usual method of estimation is the use of an 
auxiliary variable obtained by multiplying 
the grade by the thickness (i.e. accumula-
tion). The estimated grades are obtained 

indirectly by the relationship between the 
estimated cumulative variable and the esti-
mated thickness. This practice stems from 
variations in the basis (thickness) and the 
problem of the non-additive nature of the 
content of the resulting variable (Marcotte 
and Boucher, 2001). 

An accumulation process for trans-
forming a set of 3D data to a 2D data set 
is divided into two steps. In the first step, 
for each sample, the chemical variable is 
multiplied by its length, as in Equation 1.

(1)

where:
•	 Zc

i
 = accumulated sample value;

•	 Z
i
= grade of the sample;

•	 L
i 
= length of the sample.

In the second step, the sum of the ac-
cumulations is divided by the total length 

after providing the weighted mean grade 
of the drillhole. At the end of the process, 

there is a set of 2D data. A simple example 
illustrates the procedure – see Table 3.

process used in this study.

sents the grade of a drillhole from ac-
cumulated survey data (multiplied by 

the total thickness of the mineralized 
layer). Therefore, all the calculations

 layer.

To obtain a representative statistic 
for the deposit, an unbinding method was 
applied, namely the method of PoIygonal 

Declustering (Isaaks and Srivastava, 
1989). The weighted and declustering 
mean of the grades of P

2
O

5
 was 18.39%. 

This mean grade will serve as a basis for 
validating the final model, after the esti-
mation process de-accumulation.

4.2. Structural analysis
The analysis of the spatial charac-

teristics (similarity patterns) of region-
alized variables relating to a mineral 
deposit is usually preceded by a criti-
cal examination of the geology of the 
deposit and a full analysis of the data. 
There are several mathematical tools 

to measure the spatial continuity of a 
mineral deposit, including madograms, 
covariograms, correlograms, etc. Stud-
ies of autocorrelation in geostatistics 
are often referred to as variography 
because of traditional emphasis on the 
variogram or semivariogram (Sinclair 

and Blackwell, 2002).
There is a strong anisotropy in 

the major directions of continuity (for 
both variables), as can be seen in the 
Figure 6. The result is summarized 
in Equation 2 and 3 (sph refers to a  
spherical shape).

.

Statistical analysis of the data is 
useful in helping to understand natural 
phenomena and especially the grades of 
the mineral deposits. Statistical analyses 
were performed with the accumulated data 
and the data was weighted. The weighted 
data was used as reference for validation 
of the final results. For each survey, the 

cumulative variable was divided by the 
length, resulting in a weighted average for 
the survey. This weighted variable (as it 
will be called from now on) is extremely 
important because it serves as a basis for the 
validation of the estimated model, as well 
as a reference for possible post-processing 
of the results (if necessary).

The layer of interest has 368 drill-
holes with information on P

5
. Histo-

grams with the accumulated data and 
weighted data on P

2

5
 can be seen in Figure 

5 (a) and (b), respectively. Note that there 
are no multiple populations in the histo-
grams, validating the geological model for 
this domain. Also, there are extreme values.

4. Results

4.1. Exploratory data analysis

in this study will be conducted using 
the accumulated variables (auxiliary 
variables) and the total length of min-

eralization in each drillhole. The grade 
of the variable of interest is obtained 
by an indirect method, which divides 

the estimated auxiliary variable by the 
estimated thickness of the layer on the 
same node of the grid or block.

The efect of accumulation in 2D estimates in phosphatic ore

REM: R. Esc. Minas, Ouro Preto, 67(4), 431-437, oct. dec. | 2014

To estimate the accumulated P
2
O

5
 

variable and the variable thickness, 
the ordinary kriging method was used 
(Matheron, 1963). The estimation was 
performed using a 2D block model. The 
blocks had X and Y dimensions of 50 m, 
and after the process of de-accumula-
tion, had variable heights (Z-coordinates 
of the blocks in the geologic modeling 
procedure). 

To perform the estimation by 

ordinary kriging, the search ellipsoid 
was aligned with the variogram of the 
corresponding variable. A minimum of 
six and a maximum of 16 samples at a 
distance of 3000–2000 m in N135 and 
N45 were required. The search ellipsoid 
was divided into eight angular sectors. 
To avoid problems of de-accumulation 
after the estimates, it is important that 
the search strategy of the accumulated 
variable and the accumulator (in this 

case, the thickness variable) is the same, 
and if necessary, the same variogram 
should be used for the estimation. In 
this case, it was possible to estimate 
each variable with its own variogram 
without further problems when mak-
ing the de-accumulation. Figure 7 (a) 
shows the results of estimation for the 
variable thickness. Figure 7 (b) shows 
the estimation results for the cumulative 
variable P

For each block of the estimated 
layer, the result of the accumulated vari-
able P

 was divided by the estimated 

value of the thickness. The results are 
shown in Figure 14 (b). A quick com-
parison of the measured variable P

(Figure 8 (a)) and the de-accumulated

 (Figure 8 (b)) shows a

Besides visual validation, a valida-
tion of the global mean was undertaken. 
The mean of the declustering weighted 
data was 18.39% and the estimate gave 
a result of 18.11% P

5
. Another way 

to validate the estimation is through 
the analysis of derivation (Swath Plot). 

The analysis derivation performs a local 
validation, where the average block is 
compared with the average of the data 
in narrow bands in various directions 
of the block model. The validation was 
performed in two directions: along the 
east (slices every 500 m) and along the 

north (slices every 500 m). The results 
can be seen in Figure 9 (a) and (b). In 
these figures, the red line represents the 
values read from ungrouped data by 
‘nearest neighbor’ and the black line 
represents the values from the model 
obtained by kriging.

Importantly, both variables show 
the same directions of continuity, which 

was expected. This does not mean that the 
direction of major continuity of variable

 is the same as that presented in the cu-

mulative variable, although it is very likely.

Estimates will only be adequate 
if the initial data receives the correct 
treatment. The correction of the samples 
using regularization is essential to 
the practice of geostatistics, and the 
wrong choice of method can lead to 
a significant bias in the estimates. As 
demonstrated in this case study, the use 
of samples with different bases causes 
bias of the data mean. 

Furthermore, regardless of the 

adjustment of the sampling method, this 
bias can be propagated by spatial conti-
nuity analysis, leading to inappropriate 
calculation of the weights of the samples 
in the estimation process.

As the case study with a stratiform 
deposit shows, with low thickness, there 
is the possibility of using unfolding tech-
niques, a dynamic anisotropy search (in 
the estimate) and/or sub-blocks.

However, as no adequate basis 

correction method was found to permit 
analysis of spatial continuity in 3D, 
these methods were discarded.

Although being an indirect es-
timation method, the analysis and 
estimation of spatial continuity of 
the variables in 2D showed satis-
factory results. Estimates made by 
this method require additional steps 
and more time to be realized than  
conventional estimates.
