RESUMO 

 

A Eutrofização em Sistemas Aquàticos Litorais e a Utilização do Orçamento dos 

?utrientes em seu Gestão 

 

A adição dos nutrientes aos sistemas aquàticos litorais é um processo natural que ocorre 

por causa da desagregação geològica e occorrências do alto oceano. Em dècadas 

recentes, êste processo tem sido apressado pela adição de nutrientes generadas pr 

actividades do homem, pondo em perigo os tais sistemas via eutrofização. Vastas 

quantidades de nitrogènio e fósforo que são nutrientes importantes de desenvolvimento 

constituem a razão mais importante. Varias definiçoes do termo eutrofização sugerem 

as simptomas biològicas que nòs temos que controlar, e as respostas dos directores para 

prevenir ou reduzir êste desenvolvimento precisam minimizar a entrada dos nutrientes 

tais como nitrogènio e fósforo. O orçamento dêstes nutrientes é capaz de determinar as  

respostas dos Directores e tambem a importância relativa de vàrias fontes. Estas 

anàlizes utilizadas com a informação do orçamento de carbònio, sal e agua são capazes 

de indicar a productividade primària deste sistema e consequentemente a capacidade da 

carga dos sistemas econòmicos tais como aquicultura. Sendo sujeitas a incertezas, os 

orçamento de nutrientes deve se utilizado para promover a discussão e não como bases 

para a formulação de políticas.

ABSTRACT 

 

 

Eutrophication in Coastal Aquatic Systems and the Utility of ?utrient Budgets in 

their Management 

 

The addition of nutrients to coastal aquatic systems is a natural process that occurs due 

to geological weathering and ocean upwelling events. This process has been hastened in 

recent decades through nutrient input from several human activities, posing a threat to 

such systems from eutrophication. The major cause is the delivery of high quantities of 

nitrogen and phosphorus, important plant growth promoting nutrients, to these systems. 

Various definitions of the term ‘eutrophication’ imply the biological symptoms to be 

monitored for, and management responses to prevent/mitigate this development take 

into account approaches for reducing nutrient input, especially that of nitrogen and 

phosphorus. Nitrogen and phosphorus budget analyses can be used to determine the 

effectiveness of these management responses, and also the relative importance of 

different input sources. These analyses, used along with carbon, salt, and water budget 

data, can also indicate the system’s primary productivity, and therefore its carrying 

capacity for economic ventures such as aquaculture. Though being subject to 

uncertainties, budgets should be used to promote discussion and not as bases for policy 

formulation.

SUMMARY 

 

The addition of nutrients to coastal aquatic systems is a natural process that occurs from 

geological weathering and inputs from ocean upwelling events. In recent decades, this 

process has been hastened by various human activities, through the elevated nutrient 

loading especially of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) compounds, resulting in 

eutrophication.  

 

Eutrophication has been variously defined by several workers, and has implications in 

the monitoring of systems. It has been understood as the following:  

Eutrophication is an active change in the metabolic resources of a system that results 

through its fertilisation with previously scarce nutrients (N and P) that causes an 

increase in organic content. This process can also occur through the delivery of 

decomposable organic matter, though less commonly. A deviation is caused in the 

structure, function, and stability of the inhabitant organisms. Phanerogams are replaced 

by short-lived nuisance macroalgae or phytoplankton, with concurrently higher 

chlorophyll a concentrations. Shifts also occur in the algal and benthic communities. 

Turbidity and low dissolved oxygen content are other symptoms. These changes are 

undesirable as they decrease the human benefits that are gained from such ecosystems. 

The effects of this condition are now on the rise, and have large-scale implications. 

 

N loads are critical in influencing the extent of eutrophy in an ecosystem as it is 

generally the limiting nutrient in coastal waters. On the other hand, in some systems or 

seasons, P may be the limiting nutrient. With anthropogenic nutrient loading, increases 

in organic matter content can cause the sediments to become more reducing in nature, 



 2

thus releasing higher quantities than usual of P into the water column. This can increase 

the likelihood of N limitation of the system with increased nutrient loading. 

 

Global warming can intensify the effects of eutrophication: elevated temperatures, 

associated with climate change, reduce the capacity of the water to hold dissolved 

oxygen, and increase the diversity of species that occupy coastal waters. 

 

Bricker et al (1999, 2007) have classified estuarine ecosystems based on primary 

symptoms (chlorophyll a and macroalgal abundance) and secondary symptoms (low 

dissolved oxygen, loss of phanerogams, and nuisance/toxic algal blooms), and eutrophic 

conditions rated from low to high based on scores assigned to the primary and 

secondary symptoms. Rabalais (2002) has described the changes that occur in marine 

ecosystems, where the symptoms are similar as those in estuarine systems, but does not 

occur by degrees, but rather is stepwise with sudden shifts. 

 

Nutrient loading of N and P has several drivers such as the high use of synthetic 

fertiliser, atmospheric deposition, agriculture (including wastes and runoff), wastewater, 

and mariculture. The time that elapses between the pressures on the system and 

restoration may cause changes in baselines that make the system deviate from simply 

reverting from the changes encountered during the eutrophication phase. The 

presumption that management can return the system to its “pristine” state should be 

replaced by targets that securely perpetuate key ecosystem functions, and hence the 

steady supply of benefits to society. Management responses that take these 

considerations into account can be evaluated by budgeting exercises, a useful 

framework in this regard. 



 3

 

Management strategies have to take into account a monitoring plan. Efforts have to be 

put into reducing N and P input from point and nonpoint sources such as 

agroecosystems, animal production, fossil fuel consumption, urban and suburban 

sources, and wastewaters. Natural sinks (wetlands) should be enhanced. Mariculture, 

which has been encouraged to supplement declining wild fisheries, is another source 

whose waste can be controlled through ecological engineering methods, multitrophic 

aquaculture, and biofiltration utilising plants. 

 

Budgeting exercises stimulate thought about the fluxes and drivers of the state of a 

system and the relative importance of the various nutrient sources and sinks in the 

system. They can be used to determine the efficiency of management plans and find use 

as environmental indicators of nutrient use efficiency, and are therefore useful in policy 

and regulation. Nutrient budgets, along with salt, water, and carbon budgets, also finds 

use in aquaculture management. 

 

Nutrient budgets are simple and flexible, but are subject to uncertainty from various 

sources. To minimise inconsistencies and uncertainties when analysing and interpreting 

nutrient budgets, it is advisable to observe standard data conventions and guidelines, to 

utilise established datasets of known quality (where available), and to employ consistent 

methodology for evaluating budgets and their components. 

 

The “snapshot” analysis that is often used in budget studies may not have much value in 

the real world as they can present a fixed view of the situation as opposed to average 

behaviour or trends relevant to management, and so should be reappraised over several 



 4

years. They should not be viewed as final statements on which policies can be made, but 

should be used to promote discussion, bringing assumptions and uncertainties to the 

forefront.

CHAPTER 1: I?TRODUCTIO? 

 

This thesis is in partial fulfilment of the academic requirements of the Erasmus Mundus 

Master in Water and Coastal Management. The topic chosen is appropriate because it 

describes several interpretations of the term ‘eutrophication’, and the symptoms and 

conditions that occur in this process. It also reviews the use of nutrient budgets in 

evaluating the success of strategies for the management of coastal aquatic systems to 

mitigate and/or prevent the occurrence and or effects of eutrophication. 

 

The addition of nutrients to aquatic systems occurs naturally from geological 

weathering and due to inputs from ocean upwelling. However, in recent decades, a large 

growth of populations has occurred and related nutrient sources, such as agriculture, 

wastewater treatment plants, urban runoff, fossil fuel utilisation (atmospheric 

deposition), have increased nutrient inputs (of especially nitrogen and phosphorus) to 

these systems to several times their natural levels, hastening eutrophication (Bricker et 

al 1999, 2007). Nutrient additions are a threat to biota, as well as to the human benefits 

obtained from these resources like aesthetics, fishing opportunities and success, tourism, 

and real estate value (Bricker et al 2007). 

 

Besides nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), other nutrients such as carbon and silica may 

affect the onset of symptoms, but their role is not well understood. Apart from increased 

nutrient loads, other human and natural influences may affect the expression of 

eutrophic symptoms. These include engineered water flow, development, dedging, 

overfishing and disease. Climate change may also have a role in the development of 

eutrophication symptoms. (Bricker et al 1999, 2007). The term ‘eutrophication’ has 



 6

been variously defined, and these definitions list the symptoms and conditions to be 

monitored for in susceptible systems. 

 

A precise quantitative framework of N and P and other nutrients in a system can be 

provided by nutrient budgets. Budgets are mass balance predictions of variables such as 

N and P within defined geographic areas and fixed durations of time (Oenema et al 

2003, Artioli et al 2008). They are based on the principle that matter can neither be 

created nor destroyed. Budgets utilise simple accounting criteria and have moderate 

data requirements (Öborn et al 2003, Swaney et al 2008). From such budget 

calculations, information is obtained with regard to the rate of delivery and removal of 

material (N or P) to/from the system under study, and in this way it illustrates how 

material mass changes within a system (Öborn et al 2003, Artioli et al 2008; Swaney et 

al 2008).  

 

Nutrient budgets present a wide perspective from which the importance of various 

processes that occur within a system can be assessed more effectively (Nixon 1981). It 

is a useful tool in the analysis of eutrophication as it allows the determination of the 

various external sources of nutrient input to coastal systems (which are the main cause) 

and their relative importance in terms of content, and also the system’s internal 

biogeochemistry and water exchange (Artioli et al 2008).

Objectives 

 

The aims of this thesis are 

 

1. To gain an understanding of the occurrence of eutrophication. 

2. To understand the role of nutrients, especially N and P, in this process. 

3. To highlight the utility of nutrient budgets as a tool in the management of 

sensitive or eutrophied coastal aquatic systems, and the measures that can be 

used towards prevention or mitigation of nutrient enrichment.

CHAPTER 2: EUTROPHICATIO? 

 

2.1 Eutrophication – definitions and effects 

 

The word ‘eutrophication’ has its origins in the Greek language, where ‘eu’ signifies 

‘well’, and ‘trope’ means nourishment (Ærtebjerg et al 2003, Andersen et al 2006). In 

recent years, taking a more modern standpoint, eutrophication has come to be associated 

with the traits of ecosystem sensitivity. There is no single established threshold for 

eutrophication in terms of primary production; the threshold varies with variations in 

abiotic factors, including climate (Cognetti, 2001). Several workers as described below 

have variously defined eutrophication: 

 

Nixon (1995) characterised eutrophication as being an increase in the rate of supply 

of organic matter to an ecosystem, and emphasised that it is an active process of the 

change in metabolic resources on the whole and not of a trophic state. Nixon (2009) 

does not assume a stoichiometric equivalence between the addition of nutrients to an 

ecosystem and the addition of carbon to the same. Nixon (1995) proposed a trophic 

scheme for estuarine and coastal ocean ecosystems, where the organic carbon may be 

autochthonous or allochthonous: 

Trophic Scheme Organic Carbon Supply 

g C m-2 y-1 

Oligotrophic &amp;lt;100 

Mesotrophic 100 – 300 

Eutrophic 301 – 500 

Hypertrophic &gt; 500

In some cases, total system production might not increase with higher nutrient input, 

but rooted macrophytes may be replaced by macroalgae or phytoplankton, thus 

changing the types and relative abundance of the primary producers (Nixon 1995). 

Differences in internal N processing can have an impact on the effects of N 

enrichment in estuaries. Biogenic silica (BSi) enrichment in lake sediments is a 

sensitive proxy for P enrichment because BSi production by diatoms integrates the 

use of silica on an annual timescale, silica is recycled slowly relative to P, and 

sedimented BSi is focussed into depositional zones (Smith et al 2006). 

 

According to Howarth et al (2000), the fertilisation of lakes, rivers, or coastal waters 

with previously scarce nutrients, such as N or P, results in an excessive increase in 

the production of organic matter. It subsequently causes changes in nutrients, light, 

and oxygen, thereby favouring some species over others, and causing shifts in the 

structure of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and benthic communities. Ærtebjerg et al 

(2003) concur in their interpretation of eutrophication as intensified inputs of nutrients 

and organic matter leading to changes in primary production, biological structure and 

turnover and resulting in a higher trophic state. The causative factors are: elevated inputs 

of nutrients from land, atmosphere or adjacent seas, elevated winter DIN- and DIP 

concentrations, and increased winter N/P-ratios compared to the Redfield Ratio. The 

effects directly attributed to eutrophication are increased primary production, elevated 

levels of biomass and chlorophyll a concentrations, shift in species composition of 

phytoplankton, and shift from long lived macroalgae to short lived nuisance species. 

The secondary or indirect effects include increased or lowered oxygen concentrations, 

and changes in species composition and biomass of zoobenthos. Low oxygen 



 10

concentrations in the bottom water (oxygen depletion, hypoxia) can further affect the 

fish, benthic invertebrates and plants. Total oxygen depletion (anoxia) can result in the 

release of hydrogen sulphide from the sediment, causing extensive death of organisms 

associated with the sea floor. As only a few species can survive these extreme 

conditions, and as it takes time for plants and animals to recolonise damaged areas, 

eutrophication can result in impoverished biological communities and impaired 

conditions.  

 

Andersen et al (2006) have put forward the definition of eutrophication as ‘the  

enrichment of water by nutrients, especially nitrogen and/or phosphorus and  

organic matter, causing an increased growth of algae and higher forms of  

plant life to produce an unacceptable deviation in structure, function and stability of 

organisms present in the water and to the quality of water concerned, compared to 

reference conditions’. And as highlighted by other workers, it is anthropogenic 

eutrophication that is of interest. An indicator often used for assessment of 

eutrophication and as a proxy for primary productivity, nutrient status or phytoplankton 

biomass is chlorophyll a (Chl a). Andersen et al (2006) recommend some caution 

when using this indicator, and the information inherent in Chl a measurements should 

be interpreted as what it is: a Chl a concentration and nothing more.  

 

As stated by Bricker et al (1999, 2007), eutrophication is the process in which the 

addition of nutrients, especially N and P, stimulates the growth of algae This otherwise 

natural process has been greatly accelerated by human activities in recent decades. 

Increased nutrient inputs foster a variety of symptoms, starting with intense algal 

growth, which may lead to more serious symptoms. The first stages of water quality 



 11

degradation due to eutrophication can be indicated by high abundance of algae, 

epiphytes, and/or macroalgae. In many estuaries, primary symptoms may lead to 

secondary symptoms, such as the loss of submerged aquatic vegetation, nuisance and 

toxic algal blooms, and low dissolved oxygen. The onset of secondary symptoms, even 

at moderate levels, indicates a more serious problem. 

 

Finnveden and Potting (1999) define eutrophication as increased production  

based on the Redfield ratio of nutrients, where greater production is achieved when the 

balance of nutrients in the system approaches that of the Redfield ratio. According to 

Rabalais (2002), it is the increased accumulation of organic matter usually as a result of 

increased nitrogen and phosphorus inputs, but also states that the condition could also 

result from the external supply of excessive decomposable organic carbon. Where 

excess carbon is produced and accumulates, secondary effects of eutrophication often 

occur such as noxious algal blooms (which may be toxic), decreased water clarity, and 

low dissolved oxygen. The ultimate symptom is the loss or degradation of habitat with 

repercussions on marine biodiversity, and changes in ecosystem structure and function 

such as cycling of elements and processing of pollutants. Over the last two decades, 

it has become increasingly apparent that the effects of eutrophication are not minor 

and localised, but have large-scale implications and are spreading rapidly. 

 

The US National Estuarine Eutrophication Assessment study (ASSETS 

http://www.eutro.org/) defined the term as a natural process whereby the productivity 

of an aquatic system increases, in terms of organic matter, as an outcome of high 

nutrient inputs. These inputs occur naturally, but have been enhanced by human-

related activities. The resulting impacts are interrelated, and include nuisance and 



 12

toxic algal blooms, lowered dissolved oxygen, and loss of submerged aquatic 

vegetation and benthic fauna. They are seen as having negative consequences on water 

quality, ecosystem health, and human uses. 

An alternate definition provided by ASSETS is that of a process that encourages algal 

growth. Human activities have hastened nutrient inputs, causing excessive growth of 

algae and resulting in degraded water quality, and thereby hindering human use of 

estuarine resources.  

 

Ferreira et al (2009) have described eutrophication as a process hastened by the 

enrichment of water with nutrients, especially N and/or P. this leads to situations of 

increased growth, primary production, and biomass of algae. Changes occur in the 

balance of organisms and the water quality is degraded. The outcomes of 

eutrophication are not desirable if they degrade ecosystem health to a considerable 

extent and/or the provision of goods and services in a sustainable manner. 

 

Elliott and de Jonge (2002) point out that hypertrophication, distinct from 

eutrophication, is of particular importance and is evident in estuaries that have high 

levels of nutrients. In hypertrophic systems, excess algal growth is restricted due to 

light limiting conditions such as high turbidity. In coastal systems that harbour 

dense populations of bivalves, the turbidity related to algal density may be 

controlled by the cropping of the phytoplankton, as grazing by the bivalves is a 

major factor in controlling their growth (Gerritsen et al 1994, Newell 2004). 

 

At the opposite end of the trophic scale, an oligotrophic environment can be 

defined by a low nutrient change of a fraction of C per litre per day (&lt;100 g C m-2 y-1), 



 13

and by low total concentration of nutrients (Nixon 1995, Cavicchioli et al 2003). Low 

primary production (?5 µg l-1) as mentioned above can also occur due to other reasons 

(Bricker et al 1999, 2003). 

 

 

2.2. ?itrogen, phosphorus, and eutrophication of coastal systems 

 

N loads are crucial in influencing the extent to which a system becomes 

eutrophied, as N is generally the limiting nutrient in coastal waters (Bricker et al 

2007). It is the most prevalent limiting nutrient in temperate marine systems 

(Finnveden and Potting 1999, Howarth et al 2000, Howarth 2008, Wolanski et al, 

2008, Nixon and Fulweiler, 2009). Unlike N, P that is deposited into marine systems 

and accumulated into marine sediments is often annually remineralised from the 

sediments and returned to the water column (Conley 2000). Estuarine systems also 

receive oceanic waters, apart from that from terrestrial sources, and have a low 

overall N concentration because of the denitrification that occurs on the continental 

shelves and the low numbers of N fixers in estuarine waters. This situation is 

compounded by their slow growth rates and grazing mortality by zooplankton and 

benthic organisms (Correll 1998, Howarth and Marino 2006). 

 

On the contrary, in some systems or seasons, P may be the limiting nutrient (Bricker 

et al, 2007).  P limitation may be more common in freshwater systems (Finnveden 

and Potting 1999, Rabalais 2002, Wolanski et al, 2008); and in tropical coastal 

systems that have carbonate sediments, that can strongly bind P through the 

interaction with Fe, thereby leaving it largely unavailable to organisms (Conley 2000, 



 14

Howarth et al 2000, Howarth and Marino 2006, Nixon and Fulweiler, 2009) and the 

high degree of N fixation in the benthos by cyanobacterial mats, epiphytes, and 

symbionts (Howarth and Marino 2006). As anthropogenic nutrient enrichment of 

tropical waters increases, the rate at which sediments adsorb P decreases, making a 

greater proportion of it biologically available and this may make the system N limited 

(Howarth et al 2000, Howarth and Marino 2006). The storage of P in estuarine 

sediments is generally lower than in freshwater sediments because of higher sulphate 

concentrations that lead to higher rates of sulphate reduction, and consequently greater 

sequestration of iron by sulphides (Correll 1998, Howarth and Marino 2006). P is 

adsorbed to a smaller extent on iron sulphides than on other iron compounds, though the 

importance of this process varies among estuaries. With increased eutrophication, there 

is usually more P released into the water column since more organic carbon leads to 

more reducing sediments, thereby increasing the likelihood of N limitation of the 

system with increased nutrient loading (Howarth and Marino 2006). 

 

For an aquatic system, three main factors establish whether N or P will be the limiting 

nutrient: 

(1) The N:P ratio in external nutrient inputs 

(2) The preferential of N or P from the photic zone as a outcome of biogeochemical 

processes such as denitrification, sedimentation of N in zooplankton faecal pellets, or 

adsorption of P into sediments 

(3) The degree to which any deficiency in N relative to P is made up through biological 

N fixation 

As a result of all these factors, estuaries and coasts are more likely to be N limited than 

are freshwater systems (Howarth 1988). 



 15

 

As stated by Hecky and Kilham (1988), the concomitant limitation by multiple nutrients 

has not been demonstrated for any unialgal culture in a chemostat. This phenomenon is 

not one that is expected because one macronutrient cannot substitute another in its 

biochemical functions. However, diverse algal species cultured in chemostats can be 

limited by multiple nutrients due to differences among species for the optimum nutrient 

ratios for growth. Nutrient levels below optimum lead to limitations, for which reason 

ratios in nutrient loads can have a strong selective effect on the species in the 

phytoplankton communities and can affect the biomass yield. 

 

Along the estuarine to marine continuum, multiple nutrient limitations can occur among 

N, P, and silicon (Si) along the salinity gradient as well as by season (Howarth et al 

2000, Rabalais 2002, Wolanski et al 2008). Increased N loads cannot be analysed 

without taking into consideration other nutrients that are essential for plant growth, 

namely P and Si, and micronutrients such as iron (Fe). Elevated levels of nutrients 

along with altered nutrient ratios cause several complex changes in aquatic ecosystems 

(Rabalais 2002). 

 

Relative to the greater flux of N and P to the coast, which are generally associated with 

human activity (urbanisation and agriculture), loads of dissolved silica (Si), primarily 

associated with the weathering of silica-bearing minerals have remained the same or 

have lessened, such that the proportions of Si:N or Si:P in river effluents have decreased 

over time while the N:P ratio increased. The dissolved Si:N ratio is inversely correlated 

to indices of landscape development such as population or agricultural intensity. When 

the Si:N ratio approaches the Redfield ratio of 1:1, shifts in the dominant species of 



 16

phytoplankton communities and harmful algal blooms may occur. A significant 

deviation from the Redfield ratio of Si:N:P of 16:16:1 indicates a growth-limiting 

deficiency of any one of these elements. It was proposed that for the same quantity of N, 

as the N:P, Si:P, and Si:N ratios simultaneously approach the Redfield ratio, 

phytoplankton production becomes less dependent on any single growth limiting 

nutrient and increases (Finnveden  and Potting  1999, Rabalais  2002). As diatom 

production increases upon nutrient enrichment, Si availability decreases. Si becomes 

further unavailable when it is trapped in bottom sediments as diatoms die and sink. A 

decline in available Si can limit growth of diatoms or cause a shift from heavily silicified 

to less silicified types of diatoms. When waters are N limited, the algal community is 

dominated by diatoms, which tend to sink to the bottom, activating decomposition 

processes that consume dissolved oxygen creating hypoxia. In contrast, when P limits 

the primary production, the phytoplankton community is dominated by smaller or 

lighter algal species and comparatively little sinks to the bottom (Howarth et al 2000). 

Macrophytes such as Ulva and its epiphytes have the capacity to take up and immobilise 

available N and P, slowing their recycling. These conditions seem to enhance the 

release of soluble reactive P from the anoxic sediment leading to an imbalance in 

recycling between N and P (Varioli et al 1996). Increased nutrient inputs may increase 

the macroalgal biomass to the point where grazers cannot control them (Finnveden and 

Potting 1999, Bricker et al 2007, McQuatters-Gollop et al 2009, Nixon and Fulweiler, 

2009). These blooms are capable of lasting for months at a time and shade light 

dependent submerged aquatic vegetation, causing the deposition of organic matter in the 

benthic zone. Upon the death of the organic matter, dissolved oxygen is consumed and 

N and P are also released which can then be reused to fix more organic matter. This 



 17

recycling may occur several times before being flushed out of the system (Nixon and 

Fulweiler 2009). 

 

Threshold effects occur in marine systems when nutrient loads exceed their capacity for 

assimilation, and degradation of water quality occurs with adverse effects on the 

components of the system and on ecosystem functioning. Nutrient inputs initially result 

in a series of fisheries yields that increases to a maximum as nutrient load increases, 

following which a decline in fisheries occurs as seasonal hypoxia and permanent anoxia 

become established features of the system. Eutrophication of surface waters 

accompanied by oxygen deficiency in bottom waters can lead to change in the 

dominance of fish varieties from demersals to pelagics. The accumulated loads of 

organic matter and the internal loads of inorganic and organic nutrients in the sediments 

below eutrophic waters maintain the conditions of eutrophication since they continue to 

be processed by normal geochemical processes in the sediment. A decrease in the 

nutrient loads to estuarine and coastal systems does not result in an immediate shift in 

eutrophic conditions, partially because of the continued remineralisation of labile carbon 

and regeneration of nutrients (Rabalais 2002). 

 

For many systems, while there is some nutrient input from natural sources, most input is 

now human-related, from concentrated localised sources like wastewater treatment 

plants, or diffuse sources such as urban runoff, agriculture and atmospheric deposition. 

An understanding of the volumes of present loads and that expected in the future would 

provide greater insight into the application of management measures and their being 

successful (Bricker et al 2007). 

 



 18

The occurrence of hypoxia and/or anoxia is the best understood and most severe 

impact of eutrophication, and is the link between N, or sometimes P, inputs and the 

increased production of organic matter that results in low dissolved oxygen them 

(Nixon and Fulweiler, 2009). 

 

 

2.3 Hypoxia and anoxia 

 

A common indication of eutrophication is hypoxia (typically defined as dissolved 

oxygen concentration DO &amp;lt;2 mg l-1, Wolanski et al 2008) and anoxia (DO = 0). 

When the DO is less than a critical value (typically 2mg l-1), mobile animals such as 

demersal fish, crabs and shrimp migrate away from the area. Resident animals die when 

the DO &amp;lt;1 mg l-1 (Wolanski et al, 2008). 

 

The displacement of pelagic organisms and the loss of particular demersal and benthic 

organisms are some evident effects of hypoxia/anoxia. Hypoxia also affects optimal 

growth rates and reproductive capacity (Wolanski et al 2008). As oxygen levels fall from 

saturation through optimal levels, towards exhaustion, behavioural and physiological 

damage is caused in the animals residing in the water column, in the sediments or attached 

to hard substrates. With the drop of oxygen levels from 0.5 mg L-1 towards 0 mg L-1, the 

decrease in benthic diversity, abundance and biomass becomes reasonably linear 

(Rabalais 2002, Wolanski et al 2008). 

 

Aerobic bacteria utilise oxygen when decomposing the excess organic matter that sinks to 

the seabed from the upper water column. An overall loss of oxygen will occur in the lower 



 19

water column if the rate of oxygen consumption is greater than that of its diffusion to the 

bottom waters from the surface (Rabalais 2002, Wolanski et al 2008). With increasing 

eutrophication, there is a corresponding increase in the concentrations of organic carbon 

and nitrogen, microbial biomass, microbial decomposition potential of substrates, and 

community oxygen consumption, but this does not occur linearly. A redox potential 

discontinuity layer shifts upward towards the sediment-water interface, sulphate 

respiration takes over oxygen respiration, H2S is generated from the sediments, and 

oxygen does not penetrate as deeply into the sediments from the bioturbation potential 

of the macrofauna as their numbers are lowered from sulphide toxicity or a lack of 

sufficient oxygen. The sediment becomes more susceptible to resuspension and adds to 

the turbidity of the overlying waters, and this in turn reduces the potential for the 

growth of the photosynthetic microphytobenthos and generation of oxygen into the 

lower water column (Rabalais 2002). 

 

As overlying waters become anoxic, many of the microbially mediated processes in the 

surface sediments get altered, often with negative feedback that leads to continued 

deterioration of water quality. The nitrification/denitrification cycle of estuarine and 

continental shelf sediments, which returns N2 to the atmosphere is a mitigating 

mechanism to excess reactive N, but the nitrification portion of this cycle is disrupted by 

the lowered availability of oxygen in overlying waters (Rabalais 2002). With the shift 

in redox potential in the sediments with decreasing oxygen concentration, high  

NH4
+ concentrations usually arise. The anoxic conditions inhibit nitrification  

and the NH4
+ released from the sediments cannot be nitrified to NO3

-. Release of PO4
-3 

from the benthos into the overlying water is also magnified under low dissolved 

oxygen concentrations (Correll 1998, Heijs et al 2000, Pinckney et al 2001, Rabalais 



 20

2002). These inorganic nutrients become available to encourage further 

phytoplankton production in the overlying water. The degree to which these nutrients 

are circulated upward through the water column and across strong pycnoclines is not 

known (Rabalais 2002). 

 

 

2.4. Impacts of climate on coastal eutrophication 

 

Certain factors associated with climate change are expected to have the greatest impacts 

on coastal eutrophication (Bricker et al 1999, 2007): 

 

Elevated temperatures may lead to an increase in the range of species that occupy 

coastal waters, as well as an increase in the number of macrophytes and their 

associated growth period. Hypoxia in coastal waters would be aggravated due to the 

lower capacity of warmer waters to hold dissolved oxygen. 

 

Sea-level rise due to climate change may cause changes in water balance and 

circulation patterns in coastal systems. Sea level rise will gradually submerge coastal 

lands, causing greater erosion and sediment delivery to water bodies, and potentially 

flooding wetlands that act as sinks for nutrients. 

 

Changes in precipitation may affect land runoff, stratification of and oxygen 

concentration in bottom waters, and water circulation patterns. 

 

 



 21

2.5. Assessment of eutrophication 

 

Bricker et al (1999, 2007) used three primary symptoms to define the first stages of 

water quality degradation in estuaries – algal abundance (Chl a as the indicator), 

epiphyte abundance, and macroalgae. In many cases, the primary symptoms lead to 

secondary symptoms, such as the loss of submerged aquatic vegetation, nuisance and 

toxic algal blooms, and low dissolved oxygen. The classification of coastal systems 

based on these primary and/or secondary eutrophication symptoms has been carried out 

in the USA: 

 

An increase in two of the primary symptoms – chlorophyll a  (phytoplankton  

biomass) and macroalgal abundance – denotes the first possible stage of  

water quality deterioration associated with eutrophication. Because of the high variability 

of short-term measurements, N and P concentrations cannot be used as a measure of 

eutrophication (Bricker et al 1999, 2007). 

 

Three secondary symptoms portray more serious consequences: low DO levels, loss of 

submerged aquatic vegetation, and the occurrence of nuisance/toxic algal blooms. 

Secondary symptoms can sometimes exist without having been the outcome of primary 

symptoms. This may occur when toxic algal blooms are transported into the system from 

an external source like the ocean (Bricker et al 1999, 2007). 

 

The overall eutrophic conditions for the estuaries studied by Bricker et al (2007) use the 

categories of “low”, “moderate”, and “high”, based on scores assigned to the primary 

and secondary symptoms described earlier. Through this method, systems with 



 22

moderate to high primary symptoms and low secondary symptoms have well - 

developed problems associated with elevated chlorophyll a and/or macroalgal 

blooms are in the early stages of eutrophication and may be on the verge of 

developing more serious conditions. 

 

There are many reasons for systems with low primary symptoms and moderate to high 

secondary symptoms: blooms may be produced offshore and then be transported into 

the coastal system. Additionally some blooms have no direct relation to the nutrient 

conditions (Bricker et al 2007). 

Alternatively, water quality in relations may have improved recently, but the response 

time for the reduction of secondary symptoms is longer than that for primary symptoms. 

The secondary symptoms still evident could be lingering conditions that might improve 

as nutrient concentrations continue to decrease. Secondary conditions also occur 

without necessarily being related to nutrient enrichment. For example, local dredging 

operations can cause the loss of submerged aquatic vegetation due to physical removal 

or disruption of habitat. In warmer climates, DO concentrations may be lower than 

cooler climates due to the lowered oxygen solubility at higher water temperatures 

(Bricker et al 2007). 

 Rabalais (2002) has described in marine ecosystems dominated by macroalgae (as 

opposed to the earlier description of the process in estuaries), a series of shifts in species 

occur as eutrophication increases: 

In uneutrophied marine or brackishsh allow coastal waters, the dominant producers 

are usually perennial benthic macrophytes, such as seagrasses and other phanerogams 

on soft bottoms, or long-lived seaweeds on hard substrates. 



 23

In the stages of slight to medium eutrophication, increased nutrient loading favours 

the growth of bloom-forming phytoplankton and fast- growing, short-lived epiphytic 

macroalgae over slow-growing, long-lived macrophytes. Phanerogams and perennial 

macroalgal communities gradually decrease along with changes in the structure (species 

composition, coverage, or depth distribution limits) and their function (production 

and reproduction). 

With increased nutrient loads towards hypereutrophic conditions,free-floating 

macroalgae, in particular ‘green tide’ forming taxa such as Ulva and Enteromorpha 

alternate with dense phytoplankton blooms in dominance and replace the perennial and 

slow-growing benthic macrophytes until they become extinct. 

Under hypereutrophic conditions, phytoplankton constitute the dominant primary 

producers and benthic macrophytes disappear completely. This sequence of events does 

not occur by degrees, but is stepwise with sudden shifts (Rabalais 2002). 

 

Information pertaining to the levels and trends of eutrophic symptoms and of nutrient 

input is necessary for the assessment of overall eutrophic conditions, establishment of 

baseline conditions, and tracking of the conditions of an estuary. This would be highly 

useful in gauging the success of management actions. The information would also be 

required to determine the influencing factors so that appropriate managements plans can 

be implemented (Bricker et al 1999).

CHAPTER 3: DRIVERS OF ?UTRIE?T LOADI?G, A?D REGIME SHIFTS I? 

COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS 

 

 

3.1. Drivers of nutrient loading 

 

In the past few decades there has been an enormous increase in coastal eutrophication 

on a global scale, resulting in widespread hypoxia and anoxia, habitat degradation, 

alteration of food web structure, loss of biodiversity, and increased frequency, 

distribution, and duration of harmful algal blooms. N loading drives a substantial level 

of eutrophication, although pollution from P can also contribute to coastal 

eutrophication (Howarth 2008). 

 

Aquaculture development has been encouraged on the basis that it can compensate for 

the insufficiency in food production due to decreasing wild fisheries (Primavera 2006). 

Near-shore aquaculture, which has been actively developed over the past few decades, 

introduces organic and inorganic wastes into the environment increasing the risk of 

eutrophication (by modifying N:P ratios) and pollution, where organic enrichment of 

the sediments would hasten benthic oxygen consumption. Apart from this is the 

possibility of introducing disease, altering the endemic biodiversity, and altering system 

resilience and carrying capacity (Buschmann et al 2008). 

 

 

 

 



 25

3.1.1 Drivers of 0 loading 

 

N is fundamental for life and yet biologically available forms are a small percentage of 

the Earth’s nitrogen, and for this reason primary production is limited by N in many 

ecosystems around the world. Before the industrial revolution, N was biologically 

available only through bacterial fixation and chemical reaction with oxygen during 

infrequent reactions associated with energy sources such as lightning and volcanic 

eruptions. Over the past few decades, human activities have generated reactive N at a 

pace that rivals the natural rate of production globally, and is identified with an 

“explosive increase” in the incidence of coastal marine eutrophication worldwide. 

Therefore, taking into account natural fixation on land and in the oceans, human activity 

has raised the total rate of production of reactive N on a global scale by 35 – 55% 

(Howarth 2008). 

 

Human activity produces reactive N by three means: 

Assistance of biological fixation associated with agriculture 

Production of synthetic N fertiliser 

Unintended creation of reactive N by oxidation of atmospheric N when fossil fuels are 

burned 

(Rabalais 2002, Howarth 2008) 

Among these, the greatest change during the 20th century was in the rate of production 

of synthetic N fertiliser. It allowed for considerable expansion of agriculture with 

associated decreases in hunger and malnutrition (Howarth 2008). 

 



 26

Reactive N compounds such as ammonium ions and ammonia have residence times of 

approximately a day due to quick assimilation into living organisms. The consequences 

of the acceleration of the nitrogen cycles by humans varies on the regional scale 

because most reactive N moves only over short distances and due to the variation in the 

quantity of reactive N produced from region to region around the world. Temperate 

regions, the major sites of industry and agriculture, are where most of the human 

production and use of reactive N occurred during the 20th century, though most of the 

biological N fixation occurs in the tropics (Howarth 2008). 

 

A measure of how humans have altered the N cycle is the increase in the rate of N 

deposition from the atmosphere since the industrial revolution. Another measure of the 

magnitude of change in the cycle is the increase in the flux of N in rivers to coastal 

areas and oceans. Climate can also have an effect on riverine N fluxes, which are higher 

in regions having more precipitation and freshwater discharge (Howarth 2008). 

 

Human inputs of N have several sources that vary among the different regions of the 

world. On a worldwide scale, synthetic N fertiliser production is the single biggest 

alteration of the N cycle by humans, and in many regions and watersheds, agriculture 

dominates the N flux. The extent to which fertiliser is used differs by about 1000-fold 

between countries tend to apply fertiliser more intensively, and increasing per capita 

income in developing countries along with agricultural training programmes is likely to 

increase the use of fertiliser in these regions (Nixon 1995, Howarth 2008). 

 

In those areas where agriculture does not predominate, the single largest input of N is 

atmosphere deposition of oxidised N compounds, with the N originating from the 



 27

combustion of fossil fuels. The amount of N inadvertently fixed during the 

combustion of fossil fuels is small when compared to the rate at which synthetic 

fertiliser is produced globally. However this can be a significant source of N 

pollution in some regions. Greater urbanisation and use of motor vehicles increases the 

emission of N oxides to the atmosphere in large cities, most of which are located in the 

coastal zone. Atmospheric nutrient inputs to the coastal ocean may also arise from 

natural sources like deserts. This input may be episodic but periodic occurrences of high 

deposition may have significant effects on the phytoplankton communities. Direct 

deposition is most significant in large systems, or in those coastal systems with a small 

ratio of watershed to surface water area (Nixon 1995, Jickells 1998, Pinckney et al 

2001, Bricker et al 2007, Howarth 2008). The importation of food and feeds to the 

region is the second largest input (Howarth 2008). 

 

Over these large extents, the flux of riverine N to the coast is dependent on net 

anthropogenic N inputs. Agriculture plays a role in N pollution of surface waters from 

both, the direct runoff from agricultural lands and from the N in animal wastes. In the 

United States, most of the crop that is not exported is used as animal feed, and this is a 

major driver in using synthetic N fertiliser in agriculture (Howarth 2008). Increased 

consumption of animal protein also contributes to N pollution, and being related to per 

capita income, is rising in developing countries (Nixon 1995). N in animal feed is not 

effectively converted to N in animal protein; so much of the N is excreted in the animal 

waste and into the environment (Nixon 1995, Howarth 2008). Of the N contained in the 

animal wastes, an estimated 30% is volatilised to the atmosphere as ammonia, most of 

which gets deposited at the site of emission. The fate of most of the N in animal wastes 

is not well known, but it contributes via direct or indirect means towards water 



 28

pollution. With the availability of synthetic N fertiliser, the utilisation of animal waste 

to fertilise soil has now been made no longer necessary (Howarth 2008). Pfiesteria 

piscicida, a dinoflagellate responsible for massive fish kills in Pamlico-Albemarle 

Sound (North Carolina, USA), and one that poses serious neurological human health 

risks, is associated with high organic loading from sewage or hog/chicken wastes. 

Thus there is evidence for the linkage of nutrient over-enrichment to some toxic 

species that kill or disable higher organisms and the formation of non-toxic but 

noxious blooms that can lead to other habitat impairments (Rabalais 2002). 

 

 

3.1.2. Drivers of P loading 

 

Anthropogenic sources of P may be delivered to coastal systems through highly 

concentrated point sources where the P is in soluble form, and diffuse sources where a 

greater proportion is particulate (Withers and Jarvie 2008). 

 

According to Withers and Jarvie (2008), wastewaters from sewage treatment plants and 

industrial sites contribute towards the load of P in rivers. In rural catchments, septic 

tanks may contribute significantly to riverine P as a concentrated source if they 

discharge directly into streams or do not have adequate soakaway facilities (a hole dug 

into permeable ground that is filled with granular material and usually covered with 

soil, which allows collected water to soak into the ground). 

 

Runoff from urban areas, including atmospheric deposition, urban and industrial debris, 

detergents, and lubricants, are other sources of riverine P. Though the concentration of 



 29

P in runoff may vary greatly, it increases with population level. Farmyard runoff is high 

in soluble P, especially from livestock manure (with higher concentration from animals 

supplemented with P-enriched feed), sheds, and paths. Drainage from agricultural lands 

includes soil and fertiliser manufactured from mined P. Storm events would cause soil 

erosion that would increase the quantity of such materials carried to rivers. Since P 

inputs to soils (especially as fertiliser) exceed its outputs in farm products, and unlike N, 

will not be lost to the atmosphere (denitrification), it can accumulate in the soil with the 

potential for increased runoff from the land to surface waters (Rabalais 2002, Carpenter 

2005, Withers and Jarvie 2008). 

 

Much P is adsorbed to soil particles, and so riverine sediment transport of eroded soils 

also represents a flux of P. the greater flux of P eroded from land or carried through 

wastewaters to rivers have increased the global flux of P to the oceans almost 3-fold 

above historic levels of ~8 million Tg P yr-1 to the present load of ~22 Tg yr-1. The 

accumulation of P in the landscapes of developed countries has started to decline, but 

that of developing countries is increasing (Rabalais 2002). 

  

While direct P loading to estuarine and coastal systems may not be as significant as N 

loading, when conditions of eutrophication are enhanced, oxygen in coastal waters can 

decline, and the bottom sediments become more reducing in nature. This can result in 

an increase in the quantity of P released to the water column than would usually occur 

(Howarth and Marino 2006) as has been described earlier in chapter 2, section 2.2. 

 

 

 



 30

3.2 Regime shifts 

 

The increase in nutrient inputs is not the only driver of changes in algal biomass in 

coastal waters, and reduction in nutrient inputs does not always result in the expected 

outcomes. Along with the time that has elapsed between the pressure and restoration, 

the response of coastal systems to minimisation of anthropogenic nutrient inputs might 

be more complex than expected as changes in other control factors may occur at the 

simultaneously. The ongoing change in these baselines (reference status) that indicates 

that a coastal system faced with having to return to oligotrophy from eutrophy may 

deviate from simply reverting from the changes encountered during the earlier phase of 

eutrophication (Duarte et al 2009). These are very significant changes, and involve 

several basic factors involved in the functioning of coastal ecosystems, that, according 

to Andersen et al (2008) and Duarte et al (2009), they would have forced, separately and 

collectively, the coastal systems to move away from the reference status even in the 

absence of direct anthropogenic inputs, and would result in abrupt changes on several 

trophic levels. This is a ‘regime shift’ involving the resistance of the ecosystem to return 

to its original status with the imposed oligotrophication, due to hysteresis resulting from 

nonlinearities in the ecosystem. This scenario considers coastal ecosystems to flip 

between alternative stable states; while during the development of shifting baselines no 

state is necessarily stable (Duarte et al 2009). 

 

The degradation of coastal systems around the world has promoted efforts to determine 

the pressures that are responsible and the identification of a reference status to which 

the system is supposed to return on reduction of these pressures. Progress has been 

achieved scientifically with the growing understanding of anthropogenic impacts on 



 31

coastal systems; however, the definition of the reference status that is to be attained 

upon the minimisation of the direct anthropogenic pressures is still to be elucidated 

(Duarte et al 2009). Duarte et al (2009) suggests taking into account the possibility of 

shifting baselines and regime shifts in the ecosystems to evaluate attainable outcomes of 

restoration efforts. With increasing human pressures on coastal ecosystem, the need for 

analytical methods for identifying ecological thresholds and regime shifts becomes 

more urgent (Andersen et al 2008) and the means of identifying them without having to 

cross them are required (Duarte et al 2009). 



 32

Chapter 4: MA?AGEME?T RESPO?SES 

 

 

As reviewed in the previous section, the return of an ecosystem to a past state may not 

be the expected outcome because of the occurrence of shifting baselines in various 

factors involved in the functioning of the system, and the presumption that management 

can restore ecosystems to “pristine” states should be replaced by targets that securely 

perpetuate key ecosystem functions, and hence the steady supply of beneficial services 

to society (Duarte et al 2009). Management responses that take the above considerations 

into account can be evaluated by budgeting exercises, a useful framework in this regard. 

 

In the subsequent sections, the utility of budgets in nutrient management is addressed, 

as are some general approaches, involving monitoring, and technological and policy 

responses, for the management of nutrient loading to coastal system. This is followed by 

means for improving the efficiency of nutrient use in agroecosystems, an important 

diffuse source of nutrients to coastal systems. Technical concepts for reducing the 

runoff and leaching of N to coastal areas from watersheds and concepts for the removal 

of P from wastewaters are discussed as the removal of N or P or both along the 

freshwater-marine gradients is required. Management approaches follow in the last 

section for waste generated from mariculture, an important means of supplementing 

wild fish catches. 

 

 

 

 



 33

4.1 Budgets as a tool in nutrient management 

 

Whole system nutrient budgets have been used as quantitative schemes to analyse 

estuarine N and P inputs, transformations, and fate. The results from budgeting 

exercises encourage the users to think about the fluxes and drivers of the state of a 

system in a quantitative manner, and not only about the apparent symptoms. They 

provide a quantitative comparison of the nutrient fluxes in the system and stimulate 

thought about the relative importance of various sources and sinks of nutrients in their 

biogeochemical cycling, which provide support in settling management priorities (Le 

Tissier et al 2006, Boynton et al 2008). By applying budgeting methods before and after 

the implementation of management plans, they can be used to determine whether the 

plans have proven effective in reducing nutrient loads. They find use as environmental 

indicators of nutrient use efficiency and are therefore useful in policy and regulation 

(Oenema et al 2003). Budgeting can also demonstrate whether interactions occur 

between the system being monitored and adjacent marine waters. An input of nutrients 

from adjoining water bodies into the system under consideration may nullify the effect 

of the management responses. Conversely, the N and P that might be exported from the 

system to the adjoining water bodies may also be determined (Boynton et al 2008). 

 

The value of budgets as a performance indicator also depends on reference or baseline 

levels against which the nutrient balances can be evaluated. As has been done by 

Bricker et al (1999), such levels can be set by reviewing data on a national scale and by 

consulting local and regional experts. 

 



 34

Suitable management plans, after an overall assessment of the system, must take into 

account its eutrophic condition (low through moderate to high), the sources of nutrients 

to it, and the expected reductions in the loads should be guided by and also reflected in 

the validity of the assessment results (ASSETS http://www.eutro.org/). These plans 

should include measures to prevent/mitigate the effects of anthropogenic nutrient 

loading to coastal systems and the use of nutrient budgets to assess their effectiveness. 

The following sections outline the possible measures that can be utilised towards this 

end. 

 

 

4.2 General approaches to system management 

 

Coastal systems show great variations in their sensitivity to nutrient pollution because 

of differences in the size of the watersheds (reflected in the differing nutrient loads), 

different physical mixing regimes, and differences in ecological structure (Howarth 

2000). Nutrient management efforts have halved riverine P loads to the northern 

Adriatic and coastal North Sea, from 14 t km-3 y-1 total P (Northern Adriatic Sea) and 

32.3 t km-3 y-1 total P (coastal North Sea) to 8 t km-3 y-1 and 12.9 t km-3 y-1 respectively. 

This has come about mainly from the intervention on point sources, especially the ban 

on P in detergents and the treatment of urban wastewater. A similar trend in riverine P 

loads has not been observed for the Baltic Sea, despite policy initiatives and severe 

disruption of agriculture. This may be because of ‘memory effects’ due to nutrient 

saturation with release of dissolved inorganic nutrients from sediments. Such cases may 

require some time before reduced loads are observed (Artioli et al 2008). 

 



 35

Bricker et al (1999) recommend the management of a system from a watershed 

perspective, and that it be focussed on nutrient sources that can be controlled. They also 

suggest that strategies be adapted to individual watershed characteristics so that the 

potential for improvement is the greatest possible. These strategies should also consider 

overall eutrophic conditions and the human and natural factors influencing the level of 

expression in each estuary, such that efforts can be focussed on those estuaries with the 

highest susceptibility that will most profit from the control of nutrients. The natural 

factors to be considered include nutrient sources and watershed alterations affecting 

nutrient delivery such as loss of wetlands. Estuaries with low eutrophic conditions but 

high susceptibility should have precedence for preventive managements 

 

 

4.2.1 Monitoring methods 

 

The first step in a management plan should be an assessment of the given system, the 

basis for which is a monitoring plan. Another important step is the setting of a reference 

status against which ecological quality can be assessed. Andersen et al (2006) define a 

reference condition as a description of the biological elements that exist, or would exist, 

at very low or no disturbance from human activity. This has to be derived from 

scientific knowledge (Bricker et al 1999). 

 

With the development in the definitions of eutrophication, monitoring methods should 

include the measurement of primary production. In shallow waters, data on area 

coverage by macroalgae and/or seagrasses can be used as a proxy for production (Nixon 

2009). Other methods that can be used to measure increased growth include the 



 36

monitoring of Chl a (McQuatters-Gollop et al 2009, Nixon 2009), Secchi depth, 

phytoplankton community composition, N:P ratios to assess the possible effects of 

imbalanced nutrient enrichment on the phytoplankton (McQuatters-Gollop et al 2009). 

Andersen et al (2006) suggest the use of 14C to precisely determine the uptake of C into 

phytoplankton or that incorporated into organic matter. As this would greatly increase 

the expense of regular monitoring programmes, it would find use in providing 

information about a system when utilised after the initial symptoms of eutrophication 

have been observed 

 

 

4.2.2 Technological responses 

 

Technologies for treating animal wastes for the removal of nutrients and to prevent the 

volatile losses of ammonia from these wastes to the atmosphere are necessary on a large 

scale, as are control strategies to reduce fertiliser runoff from agriculture and emission 

of N compounds from fossil fuel combustion. Stronger regulation and incentives for 

compliance will all be required if these control strategies are to be better directed 

towards solving pollution problems of coastal systems (Howarth et al 2000). Some 

symptoms of eutrophication in estuaries may be partially mitigated by ecological 

engineering measures for nutrient reduction such as the building of treatment ponds, 

dredging, creating man-made channels for improved circulation by increased 

communication with the sea, and wetland restoration and creation (Wolanski et al 

2008). 

 

 



 37

4.2.3 Policy responses 

 

N reduction policies have had varying degrees of success. Reduction in riverine N loads 

is more difficult to achieve than P because N loads have relatively diffuse sources, 

particularly farming. N emission is more closely related to human lifestyles, especially 

diet and the associated significance for agriculture and livestock activities. Atmospheric 

transport can also deposit N originating from distant powerplant and automobile 

emissions directly on coastal waters. A significant proportion of N discharged by rivers 

flows into groundwater, and due to its long retention time, efforts in reducing N 

emissions may not produce an immediate reduction in loads and the system may take 

several years to respond to such remedial action (Artioli et al 2008). 

 

It is important to focus on those sources of nutrients that can be controlled in the system 

under consideration. Also important is that the level of susceptibility, eutrophic 

condition, and future outlook be used to set management priorities (Bricker et al 2007). 

Considerable reductions in N and P may be achieved through a decrease in point source 

loading, especially through wastewater treatment (Carstensen et al 2006). For example, 

in order to combat an event of widespread anoxia in the Danish straits, an agenda was 

adopted recommending that the government act to reduce discharges and losses of N 

(by 50%) and P (by 80%) from agriculture, municipal wastewater treatment plants, and 

individual industrial discharges. This plan was formulated with sector-specific reduction 

objectives and targets. The specific objectives and targets were difficult to achieve 

during the original time frame and another plan for sustainable agriculture was put into 

action. Considerable time lags occurred between changes in agriculture practice and 

water quality responses, but these reductions would not have been achieved if periodic 



 38

assessment for reduction assent had not been carried out and if the national monitoring 

programme had not remained focussed on eutrophication. Reduction in nutrient over-

enrichment of coastal ecosystems will rely on the implementation of an adaptive 

management framework (Carstensen et al 2006). 

 

Long-term (i.e., decadal) nutrient management strategies will also have to take into 

consideration climatic and hence hydrologic fluctuations and the resultant shifts in in-

stream N and P processing. Thus nutrient management should be highly adaptive, 

taking into account short and longer-term patterns and trends, as well as keeping in 

mind relevant scales (Howarth et al 2000). A “one shoe fits all” appears inappropriate 

for eutrophication, and different targets need to be met for systems of different scales 

(Artioli et al 2008). It is also worth considering that while management practices for 

reducing N pollution can be effective for P control, the converse does not hold true. 

This is because N moves with surface and groundwater far more readily in dissolved 

forms than does P and is more subject to atmospheric transport (Howarth 2005). 

 

 

4.3 Improvement of nutrient use efficiency in agroecosystems 

 

Agroecosystems should be managed at several temporal and spatial scales to reduce the 

need for chronic addition of excess nutrients. Landscape-level strategies that integrate 

wetlands and other types of riparian buffers into agricultural landscapes are very 

effective in protecting sensitive natural ecosystems and are essential for ecosystem-

scale nutrient management. The incorporation of strategically located plant 

communities that can act as nutrient sinks in managed landscapes can effectively 



 39

capture particulate and soluble nutrients before they reach adjacent waterways or 

aquatic systems. Including cover plants in rotation with the food/cash/biofuel crop 

incorporates more fertiliser into the microbial biomass than is leached from the soil as 

compared to the continuous crop. This is due to the effect of the cover crop in 

increasing the soil C content in proportion to other nutrients, which has a positive effect 

on microbial uptake (Drinkwater and Snapp 2007). 

 

 

4.4 Technical approaches for the control of nitrogen loads from watersheds 

 

In some estuarine systems, P may be the limiting nutrient in the spring (Cowan and 

Boynton 1996, Correll 1998, Conley 2000), and so the greatest effects of P reduction 

would be observed during this season. This is also an important time of the year for the 

seasonal deposition of organic matter to the sediments. The reduction of P during this 

time would make it more limiting, resulting in decreased accumulation of organic 

matter. For deep estuaries that are P limited, the conditions of anoxia observed during 

the summer that is spurred by spring production can be alleviated by reductions in P 

loads (Conley 2000). 

 

N limitations occur in some estuaries in the summer and fall (Cowan and Boynton 1996, 

Correll 1998, Conley 2000), and N reduction strategies would serve to lower summer 

Chl a concentrations and also reduce the growth of epiphytes that would shade the 

submerged aquatic vegetation (Conley 2000). If only P reductions were attempted such 

that it becomes the limiting nutrient throughout the year, the retention of excess N in 

estuarine systems would be lowered and N would be delivered to the adjoining N-



 40

limited coastal systems, thus only transferring the problem (Conley 2000, Rabalais 

2002). Therefore a coordinated effort for managing both N and P is required as P can 

influence the delivery of N to the coast.  

 

The biogeochemical cycle of Si is also altered upon excessive inputs of N and P, and 

dissolved silicate limitation may occur more frequently. Increases in the N and P 

concentrations in the water column lowers the ratio of dissolved silica, and increased 

diatom production leads to increased accumulation of biogenic silica in the sediments, 

thus lowering its content in the water column. The change in Si availability causes 

diatoms to be replaced by phytoplankton that do not require it for growth, which may 

have negative impacts on the food web (Conley et al 1993, Conley 2000).  

 

Many technical solutions are available for the management of N to coastal systems. The 

following list of N sources and solutions is summarised from Howarth (2005): 

 

1. Leaching and runoff from agricultural lands: in the United States, about 20% on 

average of the new N input to agricultural fields leach to surface or ground 

waters. Climate is important, and N losses are greater in wet years and in areas 

with higher rainfall. Approaches with good potential for reducing the leaching of 

N from agricultural fields include  

• Growing perennial crops rather than annuals, as perennials conserve N in the 

rooting zone and greatly reduce its loss to ground water. 

• Planting winter cover crops that would reduce the leaching of nitrate to 

groundwater in the spring, which is when most leaching occurs 



 41

• Applying N fertiliser as close as possible to the time of crop requirement, which 

is also an opportunity to reduce the quantity of fertiliser used. Increasing the 

application of fertiliser increases crop yield up to a point, but once the crop 

requirements are saturated, further fertilisation has no effect on production. The 

N that is not taken up by the crop is then available for leaching to surface and 

ground water. 

• Artificial wetlands that intercept drainage from agricultural fields can provide a 

sink for N, if the landscape is such that it does not cause the fields to become 

flooded. Such wetlands can substantially reduce the flow of N to surface water. 

Buffer strips, which effective at capturing P (which is largely particle-bound), 

are not effective at trapping N from drainage systems unless the drain water is 

fully intercepted by the buffer. 

 

2. Animal production and concentrated animal feeding operations: this is a 

significant sector as the consumption of animal protein is increasing in countries 

with high or improving economies 

• Composting is a good method for reutilising wastes, however a lot of NH3 is 

volatilised to the atmosphere during this process 

• Biogas production from animal wastes 

 

3. Fossil fuel sources: the emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx) to the atmosphere 

from fossil fuel combustion is an important source of N, most of which is 

deposited onto the landscape in rain and as dry deposition. In the US, the 

deposition of N from fossil fuel combustion is the major input of N to most 

coastal rivers and bays on the eastern seafront through export from their 



 42

watersheds. NOx emissions are critical to ozone and smog formation in the lower 

portions of the atmosphere, and also contribute towards acid rain 

• Encouraging less driving and the use of more energy efficient vehicles 

• Employing stricter emission standards to larger vehicles, especially trucks and 

off-road vehicles, is also significant.  

• The generation of electricity from fuel cells rather than traditional combustion 

methods would completely cancel out NOx emissions from that source 

 

4. Urban and suburban sources: sewage and other urban sources (especially human 

wastes) are very significant to the N loads in many coastal rivers and bays. 

Treatment beyond the secondary type (biological oxygen demand) is necessary 

to remove the N from these wastes 

• The separation of storm sewers from sanitary sewers allows for further treatment 

of each, including using artificial wetlands 

• Increasing water storage capacity of the combined sewers 

 

5. Enhancing N sinks: wetlands, ponds and riparian zones are particularly effective 

at trapping N that serve to sediment out particulate N as well as converting 

reactive biologically available N into harmless N2 gas through denitrification. 

Enhancing them would increased the benefits that can be gained 

• Conversion to wetlands a portion of the river basins that are a source of 

pollution to the rivers and the reestablishment of the flow of water through these 

wetlands could also have an important role in reducing N to the coast. 

 



 43

The cost for implementing strategies to reduce N inputs may be considerable. For 

example, the potential cost for reducing the levels of N from only point sources in the 

Long Island Sound (USA) watershed as estimated in 1998 would be about 2.5 billion 

US dollars (Bricker et al 1999). 

 

 

4.5 Technical approaches for the removal of phosphorus from wastewaters 

 

Many of the solutions for N reduction discussed in the previous section also apply to P, 

but specific technologies apply for the removal of P in wastewater. The treatment of 

wastewater is necessary before its discharge into the environment, and the removal of P 

is essential. Present treatments remove it by converting the ions in the wastewater into a 

solid fraction. Several methods are available for carrying out this process (de-Bashan 

and Bashan 2004): 

 

1. Precipitation of P with metal salts: chemical precipitations with iron, alum, or 

lime are the main commercial processes currently used for P removal through 

adsorption and precipitation. Calcium-phosphorus precipitation is a commonly 

used method because of its low cost and easy handling, and may also be used as 

a pre-treatment of urban wastewaters before treatment by biological processes 

 

2. Biological removal of P by the use of microorganisms in bioreactors 

• Certain strains of cyanobacteria, purple non-sulphur bacteria, and 

Staphylococcus are able to remove P from wastewater when grown in batch 

reactors or when immobilised on cellulose or ceramic beads. 



 44

• Suspensions of microalgae immobilised in alginate beads used in combination 

with plant growth-promoting bacteria can remove a significant proportion of 

phosphate as well as ammonium ions. 

• Enhanced biological P removal (EBPR) is a method that takes advantage of 

bacteria that have the capable of internally accumulating biopolymers during 

periods when the environment is unfavourable and utilise them as during 

carbon-rich phases. This capacity is applied to the release of orthophosphate 

from the wastewater and the sludge in treatment plants and its uptake into the 

bacterial cells. This technique is the most efficient of the biological methods, 

and also stimulates the growth of denitrifying P removing bacteria, thereby 

removing both P and N together. 

 

3. Constructed wetlands through which wastewaters are made to flow are another 

method for the removal of P and its uptake into plant biomass 

 

4. Recovery of P from the sludge of wastewater treatment plants and its use as 

fertiliser can be used presently only for sludge from biological nutrient removal 

as other commercial processes remove P along with undesirable compounds. 

The most promising compound for recovery from wastewater plants is struvite 

(ammonium phosphate hexahydrate), containing both P and N, for use as a 

fertiliser. 

 

 

 

 



 45

4.6 Mariculture waste management 

 

Shellfish and finfish mariculture, carried out in the open ocean on lines, and in cages in 

farmed areas, areas, are the two main types carried out commercially. Sites for 

mariculture are chosen based on hydrodynamic conditions and infrastructure to optimise 

the growth rate of the cultivated species, while ensuring appropriate flushing of the 

farmed area and sufficient depth that prevents deposition of wastes that would reduce 

water and bottom quality. If the chosen site does not allow proper water circulation, 

submarine blowers can be used to disperse the residues or finfish cages can be 

suspended from single moorings (Buschmann et al 2008). 

 

 

4.6.1 Ecological engineering of mariculture 

 

The aim of ecological engineering is to prevent adverse effects on the environment from 

human activities or to recover from these effects. To avoid disruption from the 

introduction of aquaculture species into coastal areas, the comparative abundance of 

organisms that have differing ecosystem functions can be balanced using new 

technologies in this field. The rotation of farming sites would allow for their recovery 

with time (Buschmann et al 2008). 

 

Fish provide an ecological service, and the farming sites could serve as nurseries as well 

as refuges. The coupled use of such sites as both farming areas and refuges. The 

coupled use of such sites as both farming areas and reserves requires a large amount of 

information that varies from area to area. Potential interactions of wild fish and other 



 46

species (especially predators) should be considered. Another emerging method for 

reducing wastes is the development of artificial reefs in which a significant biomass of 

extracting organisms would be important. Artificial reefs also provide a habitat for 

diverse organisms having different ecological functions and services. Since the reefs 

would be placed on the bottom of the faming site, where the water quality is reduced 

and light limited, algal growth would be limited and because of this, biofiltration may 

not be increased. Further testing will be required before this method can be 

implemented (Buschmann et al 2008). 

 

For the use of these approaches, regulatory and financial incentives are necessary to 

recognise their benefits. 

 

 

4.6.2 Integrated multitrophic aquaculture (IMTA) 

 

Integrated mariculture is bioremediation using integrated concepts to restore water 

quality to its natural state (Troell et al 2003). The development of open IMTA systems 

requires well-established knowledge of the oceanographic features of a water body used 

for aquaculture, which can be used for determining the impact of the IMTA layout in 

reducing wastes. For this purpose, coastal water circulation models are important, along 

with complementary models. 

 

‘Bag’ techniques for aquaculture that isolate an operation from its surroundings by 

developing closed systems at sea, though useful, have not as yet been applied on a 

commercial scale due to cost and technological issues. This technique would not 



 47

discharge the waste generated into the sea and would be contained within the closed 

systems (Buschmann et al 2008). 

 

Land-based IMTA methods can be inclusive, adaptable to several fish/shrimp, shellfish, 

and seaweed culture combinations at any level of intensification (Buschmann et al 

2008). Ammonia is the form of N that is released by fish and shellfish in aquaculture, 

and this is the preferred N source for seaweeds (Troell et al 2003). High quality edible 

seaweed can thus be generated from such systems that can be used as feed for the 

cultured fish, which would reduce the pressures on the ecologically important 

phanerogams. This land-based method has high economic benefits (Troell et al 2003, 

Buschmann et al 2008). 

 

Land-based recirculation systems that use bacteria as biofilters have a high capacity for 

denitrifying and transforming wastes. This method has not yet developed at the 

commercial stage since bacterial transformation of wastes does not yield any product of 

commercial value, such as the seaweed in IMTA systems, and currently remains 

complex and costly (Troell et al 2003, Buschmann et al 2008). 

 

IMTA at sea has been developed as a means of increasing the environmental and 

economic sustainability of marine open-water systems. Unlike land-based IMTA, these 

are capable of achieving high efficiency (Buschmann et al 2008). If oxygen levels 

remain stable, the particulate matter that settles onto the sediments could be removed 

from the system by cultivating scavenger organisms of commercial value, such as crabs, 

lobsters, and sea cucumbers (Troell et al 2003, Buschmann et al 2008). 

 



 48

4.6.3 Biofiltration by plants 

 

Plant biofilters, being assimilative in nature, can greatly reduce the overall 

environmental impact of fish culture and stabilise the culture environment. Algae, 

especially seaweeds, are suitable for biofiltration as they are highly productive and have 

economic value (Neori et al 2004). 

 

Because of its complexity, biofiltration poses significant financial costs. To raise its 

revenues, the productivity per unit of feed must be increased. The waste nutrients from 

the fish culture are used for the auxiliary production of new plant biomass, which can be 

used as feed in shellfish culture, or marketed itself for human consumption, 

phycocolloids, feed supplements, agrichemicals, nutraceuticals, and pharmaceuticals. 

Ulva, Gracilaria, and Porphyra, the most commonly used seaweeds in mariculture 

biofiltration, have been used for these purposes (Neori et al 2004). 

 

The ability to remove ammonia from the effluent is a requisite of the seaweed biofilter 

species, as is resistance to epiphytes and small herbivores. Ulva is the most preferred 

species in this respect, but once a different species has been selected as the biofilter, 

proper management of the culture can lessen the epiphyte problem, such as by filtration. 

The main management aspects are proper harvesting frequency and water flow, changes 

in water level, pulse feeding (to promote growth), and a high stocking density. The daily 

rate of areal uptake of total N as ammonia is an economically important feature in 

seaweed biofilters – the uptake capacity is inversely proportional to the cost and size of 

the biofiltration system. The uptake efficiency is also an important point (Neori et al 

2004). 



 49

 

In open mariculture systems, the efficiency of nutrient uptake by seaweed has been low 

due to the nature of the water flow, and requires further study, though saline aquaculture 

effluents can also be treated using this method through land-based recirculation. This 

technique removes P from effluents as well, though to a smaller extent than N (Neori et 

al 2004).

CHAPTER 5:  OVERVIEW OF LOICZ BUDGETS DATABASE A?D CASE 

STUDIES 

 

5.1 An overview of the LOICZ budget database 

 

The Land – Ocean Interactions in the Coastal Zone (LOICZ) has a catalogued database 

of sites around the world where the budgeting method has been applied. An analysis of 

this database has provided a profile of the number of sites over each continent (figure 

5.1), with the global distribution as shown in figure 5.2.  

 

A very small proportion of the budgeted sites were shown to have balanced production, 

where, through the LOICZ budgeting procedure, the system was found to be neither a 

source of nor a sink for nutrients. The autotrophic and heterotrophic sites are present in 

the ratio of 1.277, and their distribution is as shown in figures 5.3 and 5.4.  

 

Among these sites are those that have been budgeted twice – 4 in Asia (Calaug Bay, 

Manila Bay, San Miguel Bay, and BangPakong Bay), and 4 in Europe (Bothnian Bay, 

Bothnian Sea, Baltic Proper, and S’Ena Arrubia Lagoon): 

• Calaug Bay in the Philippines was budgeted in 1999 and 2000 and was found to 

be heterotrophic both times. 

• Manila Bay, The Philippines, was found to be heterotrophic in both 1998 and 

2000. More attention was given to waste loading in 2000 than in the earlier year. 

• San Miguel Bay, The Philippines, was budgeted in 1999 and 2000, and was 

autotrophic on both occasions. 



 51

• BangPakong Estuary in Thailand was found to be heterotrophic in both the years 

it was budgeted, and the nutrient sources were better described in 1999 than in 

1997. 

• The Bothnian Bay and Bothnian Sea in Europe were both autotrophic when 

budgeted in 1997 and 2001. 

• The Baltic Proper in Europe was autotrophic when budgeted in 1997, but found 

to be mildly heterotrophic upon the budgeting in 2001. 

• S’Ena Arrubia Lagoon in Italy was budgeted in 1994 and 1995 and was 

autotrophic.

5.2 ?ew developments in the use of nutrient budgets 

 

5.2.1. Application to muddy systems 

 

Many coastal ecosystems around the world contain high levels of sediment, either 

naturally or through human intervention. The presence of such sediments (or mud) in 

these waters lowers the quantity of light that penetrates through, decreasing the rate of 

primary productivity in that system, and through this controlling life in that water 

column. The flux of nutrients between the sediments and the water column is controlled 

by bacteria, and the partition coefficient that plays a major role in the partitioning 

between particulate and dissolved forms of P is controlled by mud suspension. A new 

LOICZ budget model was developed for application to estuaries with muddy waters. 



 54

With the use of this new model, the sensitivity and health of such estuaries can be 

ascertained (LOICZ Deltas). 

 

5.2.2. Link to ASSETS 

 

Simple biogeochemical models, such as nutrient budgets that provide descriptions of the 

biochemical and ecological dynamics of estuaries, are utilised in determining the degree 

of sensitivity of an estuary to external drivers since field observations on their own may 

not be sufficient to describe the system without the understanding of an fundamental 

mechanism occurring in that system. (Swaney et al 2008). The assessment of estuarine 

trophic status (ASSETS) utilises this to learn the health of the system, as well as its 

sensitivity to an increase or decrease in external nutrient loads. 

 

5.2.3. Link to conceptual diagrams 

 

Conceptual diagrams aid in the understanding of processes related to the transformation 

of N and P in coastal and other waters (Hamilton et al), and provide insights into how 

ecosystems respond to global changes (IGBP). Conceptual diagrams also find use in 

setting up appropriate monitoring programmes, and identifying management priorities 

(IAN). It is a tool that can therefore be used in conjunction with nutrient budgets in the 

management of nutrient enrichment. 

 

 

 

 



 55

5.2.3. Link to fisheries 

 

The nutrient dynamics of an ecosystem are important for productive fisheries in 

sustaining phytoplankton and peak rates of primary production in the spring. Upwelling 

that occurs during the summer/winter monsoon provides an allochthonous source of P 

relative to N (Liu et al 2009), and this may reduce any limiting effects of the nutrients 

on phytoplankton growth. Large-scale aquaculture aquaculture also discharges 

considerable quantities of nutrients into the surrounding waters. While nutrients are lost 

from the ecosystem through commercial and recreational fisheries, an input of nutrients 

may result in algal blooms that have detrimental effects on aquatic life. 

 

 

5.3 Case study: S’Ena Arrubia lagoon, Italy. 

 

S’Ena Arrubia lagoon is located along the centre-western coast of Sardinia, Italy (39.83 

°N and 8.57 °E). It is 1.2 km2 wide, has a mean depth of 40 cm, and is the residue of the 

wider Sassu Pond that was reclaimed in 1937 (Trebini et al information sheet). 

 

Freshwater is input from the watersheds of two canals: Rio Sant’Anna that drains an 

area of 78.4 km2, and the Canale delle aquae basse, which drains an area of 50 km2 that 

is extensively utilised for farming and zootechnics. The lagoon communicates with the 

sea through a channel. The climate of this region is mediterranean with long, hot 

summers and short, mild, and rainy winters. Precipitation, averaging 65 cm annually, is 

low, and therefore the level of the water flowing into the lagoon is also low (Trebini et 

al information sheet). 



 56

 

The lagoon is highly eutrophic and dystrophic crises and fish kills occasionally occur. 

Intense phytoplankton blooms occur in the spring when terrestrial runoff is the highest 

(Fiocca et al 1996, Trebini et al information sheet), especially from Cyclotella  atomus 

(Husted) and Chlorella sp. Macroalgae, consisting mostly of Ulva sp. And 

Enteromorpha flexuosa (Kützing) DeToni, become abundant in late spring to summer 

(Fiocca et al 1996, Trebini et al information sheet) and, having a high affinity for N, 

may compete with the development of the phytoplankton (Fiocca et al 1996). 

 

The N:P ratio is low in the spring-summer period (Fiocca et al 1996,Trebini et al 

information sheet), and very high having abrupt peaks in the autumn-winter periods. 

These dynamics are dependent on the quantity and the way water is input from the 

Canale delle aquae basse, which provides a substantial percentage of the freshwater 

flowing into the lagoon. High fluctuations in oxygen levels are also characteristic 

(Trebini et al information sheet). 

 

The lagoon is a Ramsar site that is included in its listing for important bird areas. It is a 

wintering and nesting area for several species of waterfowl. It and also has great 

importance for its fauna. The main human activities in this wetland are fishing (which is 

economically important), outdoor recreation, and educational and scientific research 

(Trebini et al 2005, Trebini et al information sheet). 

 

Through the application of the LOICZ (Land-Ocean Interactions in the Coastal Zone) 

model to this lagoon, it was observed that there is a general trend for the prevalence of 

nutrient storing processes over nutrient mobilisation, and that N fixation dominates over 



 57

denitrification. Production appears to be the dominant process over most of the year. 

These results prove that in terms of its net metabolism, S’Ena Arrubia lagoon is to be 

considered autotrophic (Trebini et al information sheet). 

 

On many counts, coastal lagoons are characterised by large nutrient inputs from 

anthropogenic sources and also by limited seawater exchange, low water turnover, and 

long residence time. Because these systems are ecologically and economically 

important, several attempts have been made to improve their water quality by increasing 

tidal flushing. The sea mouth was widened in 2000 using engineering means to improve 

its flushing and hydrodynamics and reduce the high trophic levels. The change in the 

lagoon morphology was expected to better the water exchange, lower nutrient 

concentrations, and limit algal blooms (Trebini et al 2005). 

 

When the conditions of the system before and after modification were compared, a larger 

number of higher salinity values was recorded after. Differences in the species of 

phytoplankton present were observed. The LOICZ model drew attention to the residence 

times of the water in the lagoon before and after the widening of the sea mouth. On the 

contrary, there was no relevant difference in the total and reactive P concentrations or in 

the concentrations of the various inorganic forms of N between the two periods. The 

expected reductions in nutrient exchange were not observed probably because the lagoon 

still receives heavy inputs from the catchments. The widening of the sea mouth in systems 

with high trophic levels might make its environmental conditions more marine, which 

would seriously modify the system’s ecology (Trebini et al 2005). 

 



 58

Trebini et al (2005) have suggested that for proper management of the S’Ena Arrubia 

lagoon, it is necessary to first ascertain what the lagoon is to be used for, and then 

apply suitable strategies to achieve this. Data has to be established on important 

ecosystem variables to (1) enable the correct availability of fresh water and 

permissible nutrient inputs to the lagoon to maintain a good level of fish production 

(2) define the quantity of water that should be exchanged with the sea to obtain good 

vivification of water and avoid anoxia. However, the great variability in the structural 

components of such systems makes it impossible to accurately predict the results and 

consequences of any particular management strategy. 

 

 

5.4 Case study: Sacca di Goro lagoon, Italy 

 

The Po river drains a large part of northern Italy, an area with a surface of 67000 km2 

and about 17 million inhabitants. The Po di Volano canal-Sacca di Goro lagoon is a 

small hydrographic system partially located in the southern portion of the Po delta, and 

accounts for about 1% of the total area of the Po river catchment. Only the eastern 

portion of the watershed belongs to the delta, whereas the western portion is for most 

part a human-regulated system that is the outcome of a reclamation that is centuries old. 

The entire Sacca di Goro watershed is located in an area that lies below sea level 

(Viaroli et al 2006). 

 

The Po di Volano-Sacca di Goro watershed has an area of 860 km2 and is composed of 

three sub-basins: the Po di Volano, the Canal Bianco, and the Giralda canals. All these 

three sub-basins are human-regulated, and the Canal Bianco and the Giralda are 



 59

partially connected with the Po di Volano. Freshwater inflow is partially independent of 

precipitation as the overall hydrographic system is human-regulated. During the rainy 

period, from late summer through late spring, the canals are kept empty in order to 

avoid the risk of flooding. In the summer, the drainage system is filled with fresh water 

that was released from the Po di Goro river for irrigation purposes. The water that 

drains from the agricultural systems is then delivered to the Po di Volano, the Canal 

Bianco, and the Giralda that leads to summer peaks of freshwater discharge into the 

lagoon (Viaroli et al 2006). 

 

The Sacca di Goro lagoon is a shallow water embayment of the Po river delta (44?47’-

44?50’ N and 12?15’-12?20’ E). The lagoon is surrounded by embankments and 

freshwater input is mainly from the Po di Volano, the Canal Bianco, and the Giralda 

canals. The average water retention time ranges from 1-4 days, although stagnation can 

occur in the sheltered portions. Water is presently exchanged between the lagoon and 

the adjacent Adriatic Sea through two sea mouths in the southern sand barrier. The 

Sacca di Goro, with minor aquatic ecosystems, is important for the protection and 

conservation of waterfowl (Viaroli et al 2006). 

 

The population density of the Po di Volano watershed is relatively low, and has been 

negatively inclined during the last decade. The main economic activities are agriculture 

(utilising 80% of the watershed) and aquaculture. Changes are occurring in the 

agricultural and zootechnical practices as a result of the population decrease. Pesticides 

and fertilisers are used in crop cultivation, and that of rice requires flooded soils, which 

keeps the pesticides and fertilisers in solution, thereby increasing the risk of pollution to

the lagoon. Livestock is of minor relevance because of a decline in poultry and cattle 

rearing (Viaroli et al 2006). 

 

Sacca di Goro is currently one of the best production sites in Europe for the Manila 

clam Tapes philippinarum turning out an annual crop of several thousand tonnes. This 

occupation generates a high economic income of 50-100 million euros each year. 

Through the year, young clams (5-10mm in shell length) are collected from along the 

southern sand barrier and sown in the licensed areas of the lagoon. The clams grow to 

commercial size within a few months because of the high food availability. Market 

demand determines the quantities harvested. As the clams are harvested by manual 

dredging, this causes alterations at those points in the natural stratification of the 

sediment, and also an increase in sediment resuspension, nutrient release and the 

mobility of reduced compounds (Bartoli et al 2001, Viaroli et al 2006). Massive clam 

mortality has occurred due to blooms of Ulva rigida and related events. Evidence from 

research has shown that clams themselves can play a role in oxygen depletion and 

increasing organic nutrient cycling and the deposition of organic matter in the surface 

sediments, which stimulates sulphide production through the reduction of sulphate. In 

the farmed areas of the lagoon, the sediment was enriched with biogenic carbonates that 

are recognised in the control of P recycling through adsorption and coprecipitation. The 

dominance of the clams within the community also caused other organisms to be 

displaced with the loss of their associated functions (Viaroli et al 2006). 

 

The green nitrophilous seaweed Ulva rigida has replaced the original vegetation of 

Sacca di Goro that was composed mainly of submerged aquatic phanerogams, for 

which N loading was considered responsible. Blooms of the red macroalga Gracilaria 



 61

verrucosa were important during the late 80s and early 90s and that of the Cladophora 

species occurred in the summers of 1996-98, whereas at other times monospecific 

Ulva blooms dominated. With favourable climatic conditions, Ulva reached its 

maximum biomass, followed by a sudden collapse of the mats that decomposed 

causing anoxia and the release of sulphide into the water column. A general principle 

is that the relative abundance of the main nutrients, especially N, controls the 

macroalgal productivity and the onset of biomass collapse. In systems with high 

nitrate input like the Sacca di Goro, the nitrate was considered one of the key factors 

in controlling macroalgal blooms. Though the growth of Ulva can also regulate the 

retention and recycling of nutrients within the ecosystem, but the N accumulation was 

shown to be only a temporary sink. Upon the crash of the biomass, the nutrients are 

rapidly recycled (Viaroli et al 2006). 

 

In the Sacca di Goro lagoon, the manual harvesting of the clams makes use of rakes to 

dredge the sediment. The harvested are represents less than 1% of the entire farmed 

area. Field experiments have shown that dredging increased the oxygen demand of the 

sediment twenty fold and the levels of ammonia and reactive P approximately 50 and 

100 times over (Viaroli et al 2006). Carbon dioxide, ammonia, reactive P, and silica 

fluxes were all strongly stimulated by the presence of the clams. This happens because 

of the reducing conditions at the sediment surface that get established with the 

excretion and rapid degradation of organic matter at the sediment-water interface. 

Silica was regenerated about nine times faster probably from the feeding of the clams 

on silicaceous diatoms and active bacterial metabolism of the excreted matter (Bartoli 

et al 2001). 

 



 62

The overall metabolism of this lagoon was analysed using the LOICZ biogeochemical 

model. The residence time of the water ranged from 1-4 days, depending on inputs of 

freshwater and exchanges between the adjacent sea. Data for 1997 demonstrate that the 

internal fluxes of DIP and DIN correspond to the seasonal trend of macroalgal nutrient 

uptake during the growth phase and release during the subsequent disintegration. The 

net ecosystem metabolism follows a similar pattern with an autotrophic phase during 

algal growth; however on an annual basis, the lagoon is considered heterotrophic with a 

net ecosystem metabolism of about - 50 mmol Cm-2 d-1 (Viaroli et al 2006). 

 

For the mitigation of water circulation in the lagoon, the canals were dredged (Viaroli et 

al 2006). A short-term bloom alleviation strategy used is to harvest the Ulva biomass when 

it approaches the threshold level, and Cellina et al (2003) suggest the use of a larger 

number vessels for this purpose as soon as the threshold is reached as it is more efficient in 

controlling anoxic crises and more economic. Organic alternatives for the agriculture 

practised on the watershed are promising ecologically and financially (Viaroli et al 2006). 

 

 

5.5 Case Study: Budget analysis for the Mandovi Estuary – Goa, India 

 

The budgeting method has earlier been applied to the Mandovi estuary located in Goa, 

India, as catalogued in the LOICZ database. The analysis has been repeated using data 

collected from literary sources:  

 

Estuaries are an important part of the watershed-coastal zone continuum, and are 

affected by both natural and anthropogenic forcing. The Mandovi estuary (15º28’N; 



 63

73º52’E) (figure 5.5) is a tide - dominated estuary, situated in the state of Goa on the 

western coast of India, which drains into the Arabian Sea (i.e. the north-western Indian 

Ocean). It has, on the average, an area of about 29 km2 and a depth of 5 m2 (Alagarsamy 

2006). The estuary has thick mangrove forests, and several small streams that originate 

in the Sahyadri Hills empty into this region. The hydrological characteristics of the 

estuary are steered by the monsoon regime (Alagarsamy 2006) and a majority of the 

freshwater discharge occurs only during the southwest monsoon (June – October), the 

runoff during the remaining months being almost negligible (Kessarkar et al 2010). 

Goa is a significant source of iron ore and ferromanganese in India, and the mining and 

export of these minerals play an important role in the state’s economy. The estuarine 

channel of the Mandovi is used for transportation of the mined minerals by barges to the 

Mormugao Harbour on the coastal Arabian Sea. Mining and industrial activities 

discharge nutrients, heavy metals, and inorganic and organic industrial wastes into the 

estuary (Kessarkar et al 2010). The estuary also receives municipal and agricultural 

wastes from the urban and farmed portions of the watershed. Other conspicuous 

activities in the estuary include the navigation by fishing trawlers, passenger ferries, and 

recreational activities such as boat cruises and casinos for tourists. 

 

The Arabian Sea, being semi-enclosed, has a climate, hydrography and circulation, and 

biogeochemical processes that are not commonly observed. It has zones of upwelling, 

with widespread open-sea and coastal oxygen deficiency. NO3
- was observed by Naqvi 

et al to be present in high concentrations in the euphotic zone of the western Indian 

shelf, where primary production was high only at the surface. The production of 

reactive nitrogen has also been on the rise in south Asia in the last few decades, due to 

which the level of atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic nitrogen into the northern 



 64

Indian Ocean is among the highest globally (Naqvi et al 2010). This may lead to the 

intrusion of seawater into estuaries that is already high in N and P, hence increasing 

their nutrient loads. 

 

This study focuses on inferring the metabolism of the Mandovi estuary by utilising the 

modified Land – Ocean Interactions in the Coastal Zone (LOICZ) biogeochemical 

model for muddy systems to construct hydrographic budgets for the estuary. The 

parameters used for construction of the nutrient budgets are presented in table 5.1. The 

estuary has an average salinity of 25 ppt during the dry season, and 18.85 ppt during the 

wet season. The higher salinity during the dry season is due to heightened evaporation, 

lowered freshwater input from the tributaries, and seawater intrusion. The estuary is 

well mixed throughout the year (Divya et al 2009) and is therefore considered to be 

single – layered.

5.5.1. Water and salt balances: 

 

The water and salt budgets for the Mandovi estuary in the dry and wet seasons are 

illustrated in figure 5.6. Freshwater inputs to the estuary, and residual and mixing flows 

were estimated from the salt balance. The volume of water entering the system during 

the dry season was observed to be slightly higher than the residual flow, whereas during 

the wet season, they are balanced. The freshwater influx of 0.162% during the dry 

season and 1.502% during the wet season indicates that sea water intrusion into the 

system is predominant throughout the year. Inflow of freshwater is through precipitation 

(Vp), while other sources, such as groundwater (Vg) and other (Vo), were not 

considered significant. As compared to the freshwater flow, the degrees of precipitation 

over and evaporation from the estuary were not significant. The water residence time 

varied from 60.97 days during the dry season to 2.45 days during the wet season. 

 

5.5.2. Budgets of nonconservative materials: 

 

The nonconservative fluxes for dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) and dissolved 

inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and stoichiometrically derived net apparent biogeochemical 

processes in the Mandovi estuary are given in table 2. The system appears to be 

autotrophic in both seasons, but denitrifying during the dry season and nitrogen fixing 

during the wet season. There is a net loss in ?DIP in both seasons, which is attributed to 

organic matter regeneration processes. The net ecosystem metabolism (NEM) is high 

during the wet season, with p-r = 4.89 x 103 mmol m2 d-1, and the value obtained for 

0fix – Denit is 33.2 mmol m-2 d-1. From this, the system appears to be a sink for DIP 

and DIN during the wet season. 



 66

 

5.5.3. Management of nutrient enrichment: 

 

Possible strategies that may be used to mitigate nutrient loads in this estuary are:  

• Monitoring and assessment of the ecological status of the estuary, with the 

determination of the appropriate target to be achieved.  

• Formulation of plans for the management of both N and P that are suited to each 

sector (urban/agricultural/industrial wastes), such as the treatment of industrial 

and urban wastes by biological means, the use of treatment ponds, precipitation, 

and the use of cover plants and buffer/riparian zones in cultivated sections of the 

watershed. 

• Intervention on point sources, with a focus on those that can be easily controlled. 

An instance is in the production of biogas from solid wastes from urban and 

agricultural sources. 

• Budgeting of the estuary after a period of a few years would prove the efficiency 

of the management plans put into action.

CHAPTER 6: DISCUSSIO? 

 

Eutrophication has been a threat to the health and stability of coastal aquatic systems for 

several years.  While nutrient and organic matter enrichment of coastal waters can occur 

as a result of natural processes, it has been greatly accelerated by various human 

activities. 

 

From the definitions of eutrophication listed in chapter 2, section 2.1, the common 

factor causing the cascade of effects that follow is the high input of plant growth 

promoting nutrients, especially N and P, from anthropogenic sources. Monitoring of 

susceptible systems for the appropriate biological indicators is a necessary step in 

managing responses to excess nutrient loading. High chl a and the presence of 

macroalgae are initial indicators, and monitoring for these indicators should be constant 

with investigation into their occurrence once they are observed. Though care should be 

taken when interpreting the concentration of chl a.  

 

The character of the coastal zone varies from region to region. The extent to which N 

loading encourages eutrophication differs between marine systems because 

susceptibility to eutrophication is controlled by several factors such as size, 

morphology, and flushing and residence times. Systems receiving very high loads of N 

may develop other nutrient limitations, as described by Paerl and Piehler (2008). 

Temperature variation also plays an important role, whether as temperature differences 

between seasons or between climates. This is because it can influence the rate of release 

or metabolism of nutrients from sources within the system itself (i.e. the sediments and 

suspended organic matter) and thus changing the balance of nutrient availability. 



 71

Temperature can also alter which organisms grow optimally, and lower the oxygen 

holding capacity of the water (Paerl and Piehler 2008, McQuatters-Gollop et al 2009). 

Climate change due to global warming may therefore also have effects similar to that of 

eutrophication, such as increased algal productivity, altered food webs, shifts in 

phytoplankton community composition, and bottom hypoxia (McQuatters-Gollop et al 

2009). Coastal variability within systems and between regions would imply that any 

single control measure may not have sufficient remedial action, and would probably 

need to be used in combination with other measures. With climatic change, it may be 

possible to learn management lessons from other regions that have faced similar 

situations.  

 

 The Redfield ratio of N and P for a system is an average of the internal ratio of the 

nutrients found in various algal species in the communities of the coastal system, and so 

the actual ratio of these nutrients in the system waters is determined by the algal 

communities present there. The average N:P ratio of a system has been used to suggest 

the most likely limiting nutrient by comparing it to the Redfield ratio. A high winter 

ratio in comparison with the Redfield ratio can also be indicative of eutrophic 

conditions. Increased concentrations of N and P in a system decrease the availability of 

dissolved Si in the water column. Therefore measuring the concentration of Si in ratio 

with N and P may also be an indication of nutrient enrichment. This provides vital 

information for nutrient management strategies. But because ecosystem responses to 

anthropogenic nutrient loading varies from system to system (and region to region) as 

highlighted by McQuatters-Gollop et al (2009), very similar policies cannot be used in 

all cases and have to be adapted to the characteristics of each system. 

 



 72

Nutrients reach estuaries and other coastal systems from a number of sources, each of 

which contributes differing levels of nutrients. Nutrient budget analyses can provide a 

picture of the relative importance of the various sources, and based on defined reference 

levels for the system, can provide an overall measure of its capacity for nutrient loss. 

Öborn et al (2003) suggest that the accurate assignment of these sources that add to the 

nutrient loads of a system and focussing on management practices to reduce nutrient 

loss from these sources during vulnerable times of the year instead of total reductions 

may be more cost-effective to work towards set targets. Budgets at compartment (or 

source) levels would be advantageous in identifying from where the nutrient surpluses 

arise that would finally contribute the most to the system being monitored (Oenema et 

al 2003). 

 

Salt and water budgets, are especially useful in combination with nutrient budgets, 

because they allow estimates of average residence and flushing times of the system (Le 

Tissier et al 2006, Zeldis 2008b). The flushing rate is useful in determining if the system 

can manage the nutrient load delivered to it. The major terms of the water and salt 

budget also suggest the dominant forcing of the system: whether it receives greater 

inflow of nutrients from the ocean (including that from upwelling events) or from 

riverine inputs (Zeldis 2008b). In the S’Ena Arrubia lagoon, the modification of the sea 

mouth did not improve its conditions, which, as stated earlier, may be because the 

lagoon still received considerable wastewater from terrestrial sources. The utilisation of 

wetlands would be beneficial in achieving improvements. 

 

Nutrient budget exercises, including inferences of net productivity, allow the estimation 

of a system’s carrying capacity for aquaculture (such as shellfish or finfish aquaculture). 



 73

Budgets can be useful in comparing between different types of aquaculture and their 

effects on the system, and whether they can be developed to take advantage of 

complementary behaviour in terms of the effects on nutrient removal/enrichment (for 

example, the co-culture of algae or benthic deposit feeders) (Zeldis 2008a). The 

inclusion of IMTA, especially benthic feeders, in the Sacca di Goro lagoon would help 

to alleviate nutrient conditions. 

 

Nutrient budgets can be credited for being simple and flexible, but as with all 

quantitative methods are subject to uncertainty from various sources. Uncertainty in 

nutrient budgets might occur from biases and other errors in measurements, and 

monitoring of the inputs and outputs of nutrients through time may afford additional 

checks on the constancy of budgets (Oenema et al 2003). To minimise inconsistencies 

and uncertainties when analysing and interpreting nutrient budgets, it is advisable to 

observe standard data conventions and guidelines, to utilise established datasets of 

known quality (where available), and to employ consistent methodology for evaluating 

budgets and their components. 

 

Scrutinising the uncertainties in nutrient budgets may shed light on weak areas in 

determining cause-effect relationships. Due to variability and ambiguity, budgets should 

be reappraised over several years (Oenema et al 2003) to confirm their conclusions. In 

addition, assessing budgets on a longer-term basis may balance the effect of short-term 

variations (lower inputs in some years may be offset by higher nutrient inputs during 

other years). The “snapshot” analysis that is often used in budget studies may not have 

much value in the real world as they can present a fixed view of the situation as opposed 

to average behaviour or trends relevant to management (Scoones and Toulmin 1998). 



 74

 

Nutrient budgets aim to summarise the basic but essential components of complex 

systems and therefore reflects the assumptions and biases of researchers in determining 

which elements of the system under study are to be investigated in greater depth than 

others. Thus nutrient budgets should not be viewed as final statements on which policies 

can be made, but should be used to promote discussion, bringing assumptions and 

uncertainties to the forefront (Scoones and Toulmin 1998). The participation of 

stakeholders in the management of coastal systems is essential, and the right incentives 

and reasonable alternatives may have to be offered to take remedial action.
