Abstract

Preeclampsia is an important cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Previous studies have tested calcium

supplementation and aspirin separately to reduce the incidence of preeclampsia but not the effects of combined

supplementation. The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of aspirin combined with calcium

supplementation to prevent preeclampsia in women with chronic hypertension. A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized

clinical trial was carried out at the antenatal clinic of a large university hospital in Sa?o Paulo, SP, Brazil. A total of 49 women

with chronic hypertension and abnormal uterine artery Doppler at 20-27 weeks gestation were randomly assigned to receive

placebo (N = 26) or 100 mg aspirin plus 2 g calcium (N = 23) daily until delivery. The main outcome of this pilot study was

development of superimposed preeclampsia. Secondary outcomes were fetal growth restriction and preterm birth. The rate of

superimposed preeclampsia was 28.6% lower among women receiving aspirin plus calcium than in the placebo group (52.2 vs
73.1%, respectively, P=0.112). The rate of fetal growth restriction was reduced by 80.8% in the supplemented group (25 vs
4.8% in the placebo vs supplemented groups, respectively; P=0.073). The rate of preterm birth was 33.3% in both groups. The
combined supplementation of aspirin and calcium starting at 20-27 weeks of gestation produced a nonsignificant decrease in

the incidence of superimposed preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction in hypertensive women with abnormal uterine artery

Doppler.

Introduction

Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy are still the

leading cause of maternal mortality in developing nations.

According to the most recent World Health Organization

review, hypertensive disorders accounted for 25% of all

maternal deaths in Latin America and the Caribbean,

leading to 3800 deaths each year in the region (1).

Superimposed preeclampsia is a condition characterized

by increasing blood pressure and proteinuria after the

20th week of pregnancy in women with pre-existing

chronic hypertension (2). Superimposed preeclampsia

usually develops earlier than other hypertensive disorders

of pregnancy, tends to be more severe, and can lead to

fetal growth restriction, elective preterm delivery, and

increased risk for perinatal mortality. It can also lead to

severe adverse maternal outcomes, including hyperten-

sive encephalopathy, heart or kidney failure, placental

abruption, HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes,

low platelets) syndrome, and maternal mortality (3-5). It is

estimated that approximately 14 to 78% of all women with

pre-existing chronic hypertension will develop super-

imposed preeclampsia during pregnancy; those with

abnormal uterine artery Doppler are at even higher risk

(4-11).

Second-trimester uterine artery Doppler ultrasound

has been used for over a decade to screen women at high

risk of preeclampsia. Increased impedance to flow in the

uterine arteries in unselected women during the second

trimester of pregnancy identifies approximately 40% of

those who subsequently will develop preeclampsia.

Compared to individual baseline risk, abnormal uterine

Doppler findings increase the likelihood of preeclampsia

by six times in unselected populations (12).

Screening is only worthwhile if there is an effective

intervention available to prevent the disease or improve

outcome. In the mid 1980s, small trials suggested that the

prophylactic use of antiplatelet agents could reduce the

incidence of preeclampsia (13,14). However, subsequent

findings of larger trials did not support routine prophylactic

or therapeutic use of aspirin (15-18), and a meta-analysis

of individual data from 31 trials involving 32,000 women of

varying baseline risk concluded that the use of antiplatelet

agents during pregnancy is associated with a modest but

significant reduction of several outcomes including pre-

eclampsia (RR=0.90, 95%CI=0.84-0.97), delivery

before 34 weeks (RR=0.90, 95%CI=0.83-0.98), and

any serious adverse outcome (RR=0.90, 95%CI=0.85-

0.96) (19). The use of aspirin seems to be more effective

in reducing the incidence of preeclampsia in high-risk

women than in those of low to moderate risk. A systematic

review on aspirin to prevent preeclampsia in women at

high risk due to abnormal second-trimester uterine artery

Doppler identified five small randomized trials that

included a total of approximately 500 women receiving

50-100 mg aspirin daily and reported a significant reduc-

tion in the incidence of preeclampsia (OR=0.55,

95%CI=0.32-0.95) (20). However, 2 years later, a large

randomized controlled trial that tested low-dose aspirin in

560 women with abnormal artery Doppler at 23 weeks of

gestation did not confirm those results. According to the

authors, supplementation with 150 mg aspirin did not

significantly decrease the incidence of preeclampsia (18

vs 19%, P=0.6 in the aspirin and placebo groups,
respectively), preterm delivery due to preeclampsia (6

vs 8%, P=0.36) or birth weight below the fifth centile (22
vs 24%, P=0.4) (21). Supplementation with low-dose
aspirin during pregnancy is safe. The incidence of

potential adverse effects associated with aspirin, such

as ante- or post-partum hemorrhage and placental

abruption, were not significantly different in over 32,000

women randomly assigned to receive aspirin versus

placebo (19).

Calcium has also been tested for the prevention of

preeclampsia. A systematic review of 13 randomized trials

that included over 15,000 women concluded that supple-

mentation with 1-2 g calcium carbonate starting in the

second trimester significantly reduced preeclampsia

(RR=0.45, 95%CI=0.31-0.65), and this effect was

greater in high-risk women (five trials, 587 women;

RR=0.22, 95%CI=0.12-0.42), and in those with low

baseline calcium intake (eight trials, 10,678 women;

RR=0.36, 95%CI=0.20-0.65) (22). No side effects of

calcium supplementation were reported in the 13 trials

included in the review.

Despite some controversial findings, the existing

evidence indicates that supplementing high-risk women

with low-dose aspirin and calcium can potentially reduce

their risk of developing preeclampsia. In 2011, the World

Health Organization (23) recognized calcium and aspirin

supplementation during pregnancy as effective interven-

tions to prevent preeclampsia and to reduce maternal

mortality. However, major questions remain unanswered,

such as which specific subgroups of women are more

likely to benefit from this prophylactic medication, what is

the best gestational age to start this preventive treatment,

and what is the ideal dose of the supplements (23,24).

Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have

analyzed the effects of the combined administration of

these two supplements on the rate of preeclampsia in

high-risk women.

Thus, the main objective of this pilot study was to test

the hypothesis that the administration of a combination of

low-dose aspirin and calcium would reduce the risk of

superimposed preeclampsia in women at high risk for this

condition due to chronic hypertension and abnormal

uterine artery Doppler in the second trimester.

Secondary outcomes of interest in this population were

reduction in the rate of fetal growth restriction and preterm

delivery.

Material and Methods

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled

study took place at the antenatal clinic for hypertensive

disorders of a large, tertiary, university hospital located in

the southern region of the city of Sa?o Paulo, SP, Brazil.

This clinic offers free antenatal care to low-income

women. Throughout the study period, the same team of

physicians and nurses cared for all the women enrolled in

the study. All participants delivered at the university

hospital and were followed for 6 weeks post-partum.

All women receiving antenatal care and planning to

deliver at the university hospital, and carrying a live,

structurally normal, singleton fetus between 20 and 27

weeks of gestation were eligible if they had chronic

hypertension and an abnormal uterine Doppler exam.

Chronic hypertension was defined as known history of

pre-existing hypertension prior to pregnancy, or blood

pressure readings &gt;140 systolic and/or &gt;90 mmHg

diastolic on two occasions over 6 h apart before week

20 of gestation (2). Gestational age was ascertained by

menstrual dates confirmed by obstetric ultrasound prior to

20 weeks. In case of discrepancies greater than 8 days,

sonographic gestational age was used. Doppler ultra-

sound screening of uterine arteries is routinely performed

at this antenatal clinic in all hypertensive women at 20 to

27 weeks. The first author performed all Doppler exams

using a Diasonics Synergy Color Doppler ultrasonography

unit (OEC Diasonics, USA) with a 3.5-MHz transducer.

Uterine arteries were identified through the transabdom-

inal route using color Doppler. The filter was kept at 50-

100 Hz, the angle of insonation was less than 606 and a

3-mm caliper was placed in the lumen of the vessels.

Women with a high-resistance index (.0.55) and/or a

protodiastolic notch in the placental side or in both uterine

arteries were diagnosed as having abnormal uterine

Doppler (25) and were eligible to enter the study.

Women were ineligible to participate in the study if they

had increased risk of bleeding due to coagulation

disorders or placenta previa, asthma, allergy to aspirin,

already been diagnosed with preeclampsia before 28

weeks of gestation, or were planning to deliver in other

hospitals.

A single private laboratory (Farma?cia de Manipulac?a?o

Amarylis, Brazil) provided all the study medications (pills

containing either 100 mg aspirin or microcrystalline

cellulose and 365-cm transparent plastic envelopes
containing 2 g elemental calcium in the form of calcium

carbonate powder, or cellulose). Placebo pills and powder

were matched to the study supplements for taste, color

and size.

Randomization was carried out using a list of

computer-generated random numbers provided by the

Brazilian Cochrane Centre. Packets containing identical

looking supplements or placebo (pills and envelopes

containing a powder) were placed in individual, consecu-

tively numbered boxes by staff of the Cochrane Centre.

Each box contained either supplements or placebo

following the sequence generated by the randomization

list. Included participants were given the next consecutive

prepacked, numbered box in the order of enrollment. The

study participants and the medical team caring for them

were blinded as to the contents of the boxes.

Upon enrollment, each woman received a box with

140 identical looking oblong white pills (containing either

100 mg aspirin or cellulose) and 140 plastic envelopes

(containing either 2 g calcium or cellulose). They were

asked to keep the box at room temperature away from

direct sunlight and instructed to swallow one pill and

dissolve one envelope of the powder in a glass of water

daily, in the morning, approximately 2 h after breakfast.

All participants were specifically instructed not to take

any aspirin or calcium supplements until delivery. A

prescription for acetominophen was given to all partici-

pants to be taken in case of pain. At each follow-up visit

until delivery, patients were questioned about the use of

any medication since their last visit and the study

instructions were repeated. Women were asked to return

the medication boxes on their first post-partum visit

including the remaining unused pills and envelopes,

which were then counted. Adherence was classified as

poor when the participant had taken less than 50% of the

prescribed daily medication prior to delivery, regular for

those taking 50-69% of the medication, and good for

those taking 70% or more.

The main outcome was superimposed preeclampsia,

defined by a) new-onset proteinuria (.300 mg/24 h) after
the 20th week of pregnancy in a woman with pre-existing

hypertension without proteinuria or b) the sudden

increase in proteinuria, blood pressure, or platelet count

,100,000/mm
3
, in women with pre-existing hypertension

and proteinuria before 20 weeks of gestation (1).

Secondary outcomes were preterm delivery (before 37

weeks) and fetal growth restriction, defined as birth weight

below the third centile for gender and estimated gesta-

tional age, as described by Yudkin et al. (26). Gestational

age at delivery was estimated as previously described, by

menstrual dates confirmed through sonogram prior to 20

weeks of gestation. The investigators collected data on

outcomes of interest directly from patient charts during

pregnancy and after delivery.

To calculate sample size, the records of all women

with chronic hypertension who received antenatal care in

the clinic in the past 5 years were reviewed and those with

abnormal second-trimester uterine artery Doppler were

selected. The incidence of superimposed preeclampsia in

this group was over 50%. Based on an expected rate of

superimposed preeclampsia of 55% in the participants,

and an estimated reduction of approximately 50% in this

incidence in the group receiving aspirin plus calcium, with

an alpha of 5% and a power of 80%, a total of 22 women

would have to be randomly assigned to each group.

The two-sample test for equality of proportions, the

chi-square test or the Fisher exact test, the independent-

samples t-test, and the Mann-Whitney test were used to
compare the outcomes in the placebo and study groups.

P,0.05 was considered to be significant. All analyses

were conducted according to intention to treat. The Ethics

Committee of Universidade Federal de Sa?o Paulo

(UNIFESP) approved the study, and all participants gave

written informed consent upon enrollment.

Results

A total of 65 women with chronic hypertension and

abnormal uterine artery Doppler were receiving antenatal

care at the clinic during the study period; 14 did not meet

the selection criteria, 2 refused to participate, and 49 were

randomly assigned –– 26 to the placebo group and 23 to

the treatment group. There were no losses of follow-up, all

women continued antenatal care, and were delivered at

the study hospital. Analyses of the main outcome (super-

imposed preeclampsia) were performed on the 23 treated

patients and the 26 women who received placebo

supplements. There were four stillbirths; two in the

placebo group at 20 and 27 weeks (both due to severe

fetal growth restriction), and two in the treated group at 28

and 37 weeks (both due to placental abruption). These

four cases were excluded from the analyses on fetal

growth restriction and preterm delivery but were included

in the preeclampsia analyses (Figure 1). None of the

participants had eclampsia. There were no adverse

events, side effects or complications that could be

attributed to supplementation.

There were no significant differences in the two

groups as to age, parity, race, body mass index, and

blood pressure at randomization (Table 1). Adherence to

prescribed treatment did not differ significantly between

groups; the vast majority of women took over half of the

prescribed medication (88.4 and 95.6% for the placebo

and treatment groups, respectively).

The rate of superimposed preeclampsia was 28.6%

lower among women receiving aspirin plus calcium than in

the placebo group (52.2 vs 73.1%, respectively), but this
difference did not reach statistical significance

(P=0.112). Women receiving aspirin plus calcium also

had nonsignificant reductions in the rates of low and very

low birth weight infants and slightly heavier infants. There

was an 80.8% reduction in the rate of fetal growth

restriction in the supplemented group (4.8 vs 25%), but
this difference fell short of statistical significance

(P=0.073). One third of the live births in both groups

were delivered before 37 weeks (Table 2).

Discussion

As expected, there was a very high rate of super-

imposed preeclampsia in this selected group of high-risk

women, with over 50% of all participants developing this

complication. This led to a large number of growth-

restricted infants and elective preterm deliveries.

Supplementation with 100 mg aspirin plus 2 g calcium

starting after 20 weeks of pregnancy reduced the rate of

superimposed preeclampsia by 28.6% and the rate of

fetal growth restriction by 80.8% in these women with

chronic hypertension and abnormal second-trimester

uterine artery Doppler. However, these reductions fell

short of statistical difference. The supplements did not

have an effect on the rate of preterm delivery.

We cannot compare our findings to others since this is

the first study to test this combination of supplements in

the prevention of preeclampsia. Although we observed

beneficial effects in the supplemented group, the size of

this effect fell short of our prediction, which was a 50%

reduction in the rate of superimposed preeclampsia. A

possible factor for this smaller effect could be the

relatively late initiation of low-dose aspirin therapy, at a

mean of 22-23 weeks gestation. As previously described,

low-dose aspirin before week 16 is more effective in

preventing preeclampsia (27). However, as in most

developing countries, many high-risk women in our setting

book late for antenatal care. Another possible explanation

for the smaller than expected effect of combined

supplementation could be an interaction between aspirin

and calcium that reduced the bioavailability of each

substance. This hypothesis cannot be confirmed or

refuted because we did not assess the plasma concen-

tration of calcium or aspirin in the participants.

Pharmacological aspects of calcium administration could

also have played a role in the lower than expected effects

of the supplements. The bioavailability of calcium

depends on the type of salt used, the daily dose, and

whether the supplements are ingested with food. Calcium

citrate malate has a higher bioavailability than other forms

and has a good absorption even when consumed on an

empty stomach. However, large doses (.500 mg/day) of

this salt are less well absorbed than lower doses (28).

The etiology and physiopathology of preeclampsia are

not yet completely understood. Preeclampsia is a com-

plex disorder caused by nutritional, environmental and

genetic factors that lead to an inflammatory state,

activation of platelets, imbalance in the production and

activity of thromboxane-prostacyclin and of the free

radicals nitric oxide, superoxide and peroxynitrate by the

vascular endothelium (29). The probable mechanism of

action of low-dose aspirin in the prevention of preeclamp-

sia is by inhibiting the excessive production of thrombox-

ane by platelets in women who are susceptible to this

disorder (13,14,19,20). Low calcium intake may cause

high blood pressure by stimulating the release of

parathyroid hormone or renin, thus leading to increased

intracellular calcium in vascular smooth muscle (30) and

consequent vasoconstriction. A possible mode of action

for calcium supplementation is that it reduces parathyroid

hormone release and intracellular calcium, and so

reduces smooth muscle contractility (22). The explanation

of the potential benefits of offering both aspirin and

calcium to women at high risk for preeclampsia is at

present hypothetical and possibly related to reduction in

inflammatory factors and oxidative stress. A recent trial

involving a small group of Iranian women at risk for

preeclampsia reported that supplementation of low-dose

calcium (500 mg) plus 80 mg aspirin for 9 weeks during

the third trimester of pregnancy resulted in increased

plasma levels of glutathione, total oxidant capacity, and

significantly lower change in high-sensitivity C-reactive

protein in the intervention group (31).

Our study had several strengths, including its origin-

ality, rigorous care to avoid bias in all phases including

selection, randomization, allocation concealment, blinding

of participants and physicians, and reporting of outcomes.

A potential limitation of our study was the lack of

information on the baseline ingestion of dietary calcium in

both groups. However, since the participants were from

the same geographic setting and had similar socio-

economic characteristics, we can infer that the eating

habits of these women were probably very similar.

Aspirin plus calcium to prevent superimposed preeclampsia 423

www.bjournal.com.br Braz J Med Biol Res 47(5) 2014



According to the latest national food inquiry survey, the

mean dietary calcium intake of adult Brazilian women is

less than 500 mg/day and over 90% do not reach the

recommended dietary calcium intake for their age (32).

Only a few studies with small sample sizes have

assessed the ingestion of calcium by Brazilian pregnant

women, and they focused on specific subgroups such as

overweight participants and adolescents. According to

those studies, mean daily calcium intake was below the

recommended 1200 mg/day and ranged from 586.6 to

842.9 mg/day in those specific populations of pregnant

women (33-35). The importance of baseline dietary

calcium has been previously demonstrated in large

randomized trials of calcium supplementation for the

prevention of preeclampsia (36,37). In those studies,

women with a high dietary ingestion of calcium

(.1200 mg/day) had no significant reduction in the rate

of preeclampsia, but those with lower dietary calcium

seemed to benefit from supplementation.

Although this study had a relatively small sample size,

all participants were women with essential chronic

hypertension and abnormal uterine Doppler findings,

which is not the case in the majority of published studies.

The sample size calculation was based on an expected

rate of superimposed preeclampsia of 55% in this very

high-risk group of women and an estimated reduction of

50% in the group treated with aspirin plus calcium. There

have been no previous studies to provide guidance on the

expected effects of this combination of drugs. The first

part of this estimation was based on clinical records of

previous patients and it was correct. The incidence of

superimposed preeclampsia was 73.1% in the placebo

group. However, the effect of the supplements was

overestimated. The treated group had an incidence of

superimposed preeclampsia of 52.2%, which corresponds

to a reduction of 28.6%, instead of 50%. Therefore, for

this difference to be statistically significant, it would have

been necessary to include approximately 82 participants

in each group, instead of 22 women. Nevertheless, the

results of this pilot study are valuable for future investiga-

tions on the use of combined supplements for the

prevention of preeclampsia in high-risk women.

This is the first study to assess the effects of the

combined supplementation of calcium plus low-dose

aspirin on the prevention of preeclampsia in women at

high risk for this complication. Our results need to be

confirmed by other studies involving a larger number of

high-risk participants. Besides larger sample sizes, future

studies could test the introduction of combined supple-

mentation at an earlier gestational age (i.e., between 16-

20 weeks), determine the dietary calcium ingestion of the

participants (e.g., through a food questionnaire), and

perform bioavailability studies to ascertain the actual

absorption of aspirin and calcium.

According to the findings of this pilot study, the

combined supplementation of aspirin and calcium starting

at 20-27 weeks of gestation produced a nonsignificant

decrease in the incidence of superimposed preeclampsia

and fetal growth restriction in hypertensive women with

abnormal uterine artery Doppler findings.
