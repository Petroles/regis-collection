ABSTRACT

KaolinatCampoAlegreBasin,SantaCatarinaState,Brazilwasformedfromalterationofvolcanicacidrocks. Halloysite

clays dominate the clay fraction of the matrix of the kaolin body, whereas a poorly crystalline kaolinite is abundant

in veins. Some primary blocky structures have high amounts of illite, in one mine, but in general, only low contents

of illite-smectite, illite, chlorite-vermiculite, vermiculite and quartz were identified in the clay fraction of the samples.

Towardthetopof themines,hematiteandlepidocrociteappear inhorizontal redandochrecoloredlevelsandtheamount

of kaolinite increases compared to halloysite. The vertical zoning of alteration levels, the changes in mineralogy, the

positive correlation between depth and Cation Exchange Capacity of the clays, the preservation of different types of

rock textures in the kaolin bodies, the dominant tube morphology of the halloysite clays indicate a supergene genesis

for the deposits. Criteria to distinguish between supergene and hypogene kaolin are discussed. Transmission Electron

kaolinite andhalloysite. It is proposed that someof thekaolinite of thesedeposits be inherited from thedehydrationof

halloysite tubes.

INTRODUCTION

Campo Alegre Basin is an important source of clays for

theceramicmarketof theMercosulandaplaceofawell-

developed ceramic industry; however, these clays have

been little studied. Kaolin deposits of Campo Alegre

Basin resulted from the alteration of acid rocks of the

upper volcanic unit of Campo Alegre Formation (Neo-

proterozoic). The bedrock is composed of rhyolitic and

trachytic lava interspersed with pyroclastic material ei-

ther coarse or thinly laminated (Ebert 1971, Daitx and

Carvalho 1980). The origin of these deposits is contro-

versial: Biondi et al. (1999) stated they were formed by

hydrothermal activity; Oliveira et al. (2000) showed co-

existence of halloysite and kaolinite in one mine of the

depositandalsoshowedevidencesofasupergeneorigin.

Few data on the mineralogy, chemistry and morphology

of the clays are available.

The objectives of this work are:

phology) applying several methods which is useful

for mineral exploration.

– Present new data on the crystal morphology of the

kaolin clays of this deposit, and in particular to

describe transitional forms between halloysite and

kaolinite, and implications for the interpretation of

geological history.

LOCATION AND GEOLOGICAL SETTING

Kaolin was formed from the alteration of volcanic acid

rocks,nearSãoBentodoSul,SantaCatarinaState,Brazil

(Fig. 1). These rocks are components of Campo Ale-

gre volcanic-sedimentary basin (Citroni et al. 2001) of

almost400km2. It is aNeoproterozoic sequence (595 ±
16Ma,Cordanietal. 1999)lyingonolderArcheangran-

ulite terranes. Rhyolite is the most abundant lithotype

(Weischel et al. 2000), but the rocks are heterogeneous:

trachytes, porphyritic rhyolites, banded rhyolites, tuffs,

breccia. The Lower Effusive Sequence is composed of

basalt and trachyte. The Intermediary Epiclastic-volca-

noclastic Sequence is made of shale and volcanogenic

sedimentary and pyroclastic flow. The Upper Volcanic

Sequence (80% of the exposed area) of late Proterozoic

age consists of trachytes and rhyolites. Pyroclastic flow

deposits are common as welded high temperature ign-

imbrites (Weischel et al. 2000). Old rocks in a plateau

up to ±1000 m above sea level, fractures and faults are
evidences of a regional uplift (Potter 1997) in the area.

Thick(20-40m)depositsofclaysevolvefromthesurface

rocks. Three kaolin mines in Campo Alegre Basin were

studied: Oxford (or Floresta) Mine, Incepa (or Cambuí)

Mine and Ceramarte Mine (Table I).

Ceramarte Mine (26?15?21"S–49?12?55"W) is lo-
cated in adown-slope landscapenear thecentreofCam-

po Alegre Basin. The mine is 7 to 17 meters deep and

exposes differentiated levels over the alteredporphyritic

rhyolite. At the base the rhyolite alters to a saprolith

horizon that maintains the rock texture; the saprock has

elongated core boulders and preserves the rhyolite tex-

ture and veins of white clays. As the alteration evolves,

a network of clayey white segregations becomes denser

withinalightpinkmatrixandtherocktexturedisappears.

An oxidate facies with yellow and red spots develops in

the clay zone about 3 to 7.5 meters up. The clay zone

has anastomosingveins composedofwhite clays. Black

organic soil develops over the white clays.

IncepaMine (26?17?27"S–49?16?48"W) is approx-
imately 30 m deep. At the base of the mine there are

somerelictsof therock(aphanite) inalightgreenishgray

clayey matrix cut by fractures, coated with white clays.

At some points higher in the profile, the matrix shows

a very fine (less than 1 mm) laminated white and pale

red structure with some very coarse (more than 10 mm)

white granular structures. At the top of the sequence,

located in a geomorphic depression, there is a 2 m thick

black-colored soil.

Oxford Mine (26?19?54"S–49?12?50"W) is the
third studied occurrence, in the south of Campo Alegre

Basin. Kaolin formsfromabandedrockwithflowstruc-

tureplanesalternatingwithmoreor lessclayeymaterial;

along the planes there are black coatings. Towards the

surface, the rock turns into a white to gray clay with

rounded or sub-angular coarse blocky structures (up to

50 cm diameter) of green clay. Veins coated with white

clay cut all the matrix of the mine walls. Higher in the

profile, there is a red level (1 m thick) which is followed

by an ochre level (1.5 m thick), which in turn is covered

by a white clay soil with black roots.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Twenty-six samples from the three mines were studied:

7 from Incepa, 8 from Oxford and 11 from Ceramar-

te Mine. They were split into sub-samples for various

methods of investigation.

Thin sectionsof impregnated sampleswere studied

using scanning electron microscopy.

The clay (&amp;lt;0.002 mm) fraction of each sample

was removed after settling under gravity according to

Stock’s Law in an aqueous solution of 33 g of sodium

hexametaphosphateand7gofanhydroussodiumcarbon-

ate in distilled water (1 liter). Two oriented aggregates

of each sample were prepared for Ba saturation and Mg

saturation.

Cation exchange capacity (CEC) was determined

by barium saturation as described by Janik and Keeling

(1996). Theorientedsamplessaturatedwithbarium(1M

BaCl2) solution were washed several times with deion-

ized water. Then the samples were dried and analyzed

pregnated with Spurr resin. After two weeks the sam-

ples were heated up to 60?C for 24 hours, then cut with
a Reichelrt ultramicrotome, mounted on copper grids

and coated with carbon. A Philips 430 EM, 300 kV at

EMU-ANUandaPhilipsCMTEM300kV,GatanCam-

era, at the Research School of Earth Sciences (ANU)

were used.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

XRD-MINERALOGICAL COMPOSITION

Data were obtained by quantification on the X-ray dif-

fractograms of random preparations of the clays ana-

lyzed with the SIROQUANT software and are shown

in Table II as well as the name and the character of the

samples (rock, regolith, vein, soil, etc).

In the three kaolin bodies, kaolin minerals halloy-

site and kaolinite are the main constituents. Exceptions

are samples Ox1, Ce2m, Ce3b that correspond to sap-

rocks with high percentages of K-feldspar; sample Ox2

has high percentage of illite. Figure 2 shows the overall

distribution of the minerals along the three mines ob-

tained from averages of the % mineralogy of Table II.

Halloysite is themost abundant claymineral in the three

mines. Only in two samples of veins (Ce2av and Inc5,

Table II) the amounts of kaolinite are higher than hal-

loysite.

The XRD diffractograms of oriented, air-dried pre-

parations of representative samples of the three mines

are presented in Figure 3.

The veins in the rock (rhyolite) of Ceramarte Mine

(Fig. 3A-Ce1av) are composed mostly of halloysite.

The saprock (Fig. 3A-2bm) still contains K-feldspar.

The veins in the saprock contain kaolinite of a high-

defect type (Fig. 3A-Ce3av)withHinckley Indexof0.6.

Theupper saprolite (Fig. 3A-Ce7) ismadeof halloysite,

kaolinite and traces of quartz.

Clays fromIncepaMinehave illite (Fig.3B-Inc2b)

in the saprock but not in the veins (Fig. 3B-Inc1); illite

totally disappears in the clayey upper levels (Fig. 3B-

Inc4b).

In the Oxford Mine some primary block structures

showedhighamountsof illite (Fig. 3C-Ox2),but ingen-

eral, only lowcontents of illite (aver-2%), illite-smectite

(aver-1.5%), quartz (aver-5%), microcline (aver-1%),

vermiculite (aver-0.4%), and chlorite-vermiculite were

identifiedin theclayfractionof thestudiedsamples. The

highest % of kaolinite (42%) occurs in the veins (Fig.

3C-Ox4), and the highest % of halloysite occurs in the

clayey matrix (Fig. 3C-Ox5).

Towardthetopofthemines, ironoxidesconcentrate

in a red (hematite) level followed (in Oxford Mine) by

an ochre (lepidocrocite) level. Also some other minor

mineral componentsweredetected: gibbsiteandanatase

(Oxford Mine); cristobalite (Ceramarte Mine).

Chemical analyses of bulk samples showed that

the veins have kaolinitic composition, the samples of

the matrix have high amounts of SiO2 due to quartz and

the green clay of the blocky structures from Oxford

Mine has higher K2O content than the other samples.

Fe2O3 contents vary from 3.15 wt. % in the green-

clay sample from Oxford Mine, to 0.185 wt. %, in the

veins of Incepa Mine.

TiO2 valuesare from0.51 to0.01wt. %. The lower

valuesare fromsamplesofveins in thebaseof themines

and thehigheronesare fromsamples fromthe topof the

deposits.

The K2O content composition may be a good mea-

sureof thedegreeof the alterationof theprimaryminer-

als. The lower the K2O value the high alteration degree

of the sample. Table IIIb shows the K2O content of the

hasahighdegreeofalterationbutnot thehighestbecause

at IncepaandOxford thepresence if illite,which ismore

resistent than K-feldspar (of Ceramarte), may invalidate

this measure of comparison.

Figure 4 shows the relation between K2O content

and the position of the samples of Table IIb in the pro-

files. Samples of Ceramarte Mine are heterogeneous;

of the primary minerals in the mines.

There is a positive correlation between CEC and

depth in theCeramarteMine (Fig. 5 andTable III) as al-

readyseenwithK2Ocontent,butnot for theothermines.

The average CEC of Oxford Mine clays is the highest

(11.2 meq/100g) and may be related to the presence of

some Illite-Smectite. The average CEC of Ceramarte

clays (10.3 meq/100 g) may be due to the observed very

small length of halloysite tubes (mode 0.46µm in the

veins of the rock; 0.22µm in the veins of the alterite).

Clays from Incepa Mine have the lowest CEC average

value (5.6 meq/100 g), possibly related to the highest

tube width (mode 0.46µm).

MICROTEXTURES OF THE CLAYS AND

ELEMENTAL COMPOSITION

Visible differentiations from the walls of each mine

(Table I) were sampled. SEM observations and EDX

Analysis of the small fragments and the thin sections

were done in order to add new data on the mineralogy

and composition of the bulk samples (Table IV).

Ceramarte Mine facies are composed of tubular
halloysite and platy xenomorphic crystals of kaolinite

(Si=Al), with tubes predominating in the matrix, with

few spheres, and platy xenomorphic crystals of kaolin-

ite forming (iron-rich) stacks in the veins (Ce2v). The

iron was detected by the EDX Analyses with the SEM

(Fig. 6). Exceptions are some hard white veins of hal-

served (Ce1Av). Inherited grains of K-feldspar appear

at the base of the mine showing differential alteration as

“etch-pit formation” (Fig.7A),butdisappear throughout

the top. The spherulitic texture of the rhyolite, due to

crystallization of the volcanic glass, is also observed in

the samples from the base of the Mine both in thin sec-

tionand in small fragments and is related to thevery fast

cooling rate of the high temperature acid flows. The ar-

rowin the thinsectionphotomicrograph(Fig. 7B)points

thespherulitic textureoftherhyolite. Inasmallfragment

the porous structure of the spherulite, made of neddles

of quartz (Fig. 7C) contains halloysite aggregates.

In the pallid zone of Ceramarte Mine an aggregate

of halloysite tubes that apparently merge into kaolin

stacks was observed (Fig. 7D).

Incepa Mine facies are composed of tubular and

platy xenomorphic crystals of halloysite and kaolinite

(Si, Al), some platy xenomorphic crystals of illite (Si &gt;

Al ? K &gt; Fe), and laths ofVermiculite. Some relicts of
the rock (aphanite) are indurated with quartz box-work.

A finely laminated white and pale red facies at 4 m

depth from the surface is seen by SEM to be caused by

layers of halloysite tubes and spheres intercalated with

kaolinite plates (Fig. 7E).

Oxford Mine displays the greatest diversity of clay
particles. The Gley 8/5BG clays with the blocky struc-

ture (16m depth) showed dominantly platy xenomor-

phic crystals of illite (Si &gt; Al ?K &gt; Fe), little illitic
material of platy xenomorphic crystals without iron

(Si &gt; Al ? K) and lath-shaped crystals with irregular
ends (Si &gt; Al ?K &gt; Fe) (Fig. 7F). Also small amounts
of Mg, Ti and Zr were detected in these clays.

Mines.

The wall of the mine (matrix) is a light greenish-

gray clay composed of tubular and platy xenomorphic

crystals of halloysite and kaolinite (Si, Al), pyramidal

crystals of quartz (beta-form), platy xenomorphic crys-

tals of illite (Si &gt; Al ?K &gt; Fe) and lath-shaped crystals
with irregular ends (Si ?Al).

The white veins in the wall (11 m depth) are com-

posed of platy xenomorphic crystals of kaolinite, tubes

of halloysite (Si=Al) and platy xenomorphic crystals of

illite (Si &gt; Al ? K &gt; Fe). These clays also showed very
small amounts of Mg, and Ti and Pb.

The red level (2 m depth) is composed of tubes of

halloysite (0.3µm width) and platy xenomorphic crys-

tals of halloysite and kaolinite. Other components as

hematite and anatase were not observed at this scale of

magnification (9.000-14.000 x).

Finally the yellowish brown level (1.5 m depth) al-

most at the top of mine is composed of tubes and platy

xenomorphiccrystals(Si=Al &gt; Fe ? K &gt; Ti)of halloy-
site and kaolinite. The Fe and Ti detected in these par-

ticles may be related to very small amounts of lepido-

crocite and anatase observed in the XRD analysis.

Thewhite soil (Gley8/N) at 1mdepth is composed

of tubes and platy xenomorphic crystals of halloysite

and kaolinite and small quantity of laths with regular

ends (Si &gt; Al ? K &gt; Fe or Si=Al ? Ti &gt; Fe) of vermi-
culite.AlsoTi (anatase)wasdetectedmixed in theclays.

MORPHOLOGY OF THE PARTICLES

Halloysite exhibits tubular, spherical and cone-shaped

morphologies throughout the clay fraction (&amp;lt;2µm) of

the threemines. ArrowsofFigure8points to: Tubesare

themostcommon,andtheyoftenshowsomeflatsurfaces

(Fig. 8A). There are very small (0.14µm) tubes (Fig.

8B), short tubes (0.8µm), and long tubes (3µm). The

spherical halloysite appears in all the three mines. The

spheres are very small (&amp;lt;0.5µm) and are interspersed

with the other particles (Fig. 8C), except in the Incepa

Mine, where they form layers. Cone morphology and

partly rolled tubes were also observed (Fig. 8D).

MEASUREMENTS OF HALLOYSITE PARTICLES

The clay separates of three samples of Ceramarte Mine

were chosen because of their different values of CEC

and because of their location in the profile. One sample

of Incepa Mine that showed a low CEC value (4.4) was

also statistically analyzed in order to obtain quantitative

morphological data of the length and width of the hal-

loysite particles. Also a sample from Oxford mine was

analyzed. Statistic data are recorded in micrometers in

TableV.SampleCe1v is fromwhiteclays inavein in the

saprock, Ce2v is from very pale brown clay in a vein in

the saprolite; sample Inc4a,b is from a laminated matrix

of Incepa Mine. Also the clay sample Ce9 that is from

theupperpallidzonewasanalyzed. Curves representing

the minimum, mean, median, mode and maximum tube

length for each sample are inFigure10Aand tubewidth

in Figure 10B.

Figure 10A shows that particles of sample CE2v

have the lowest statisticalvaluesof the four samples, ex-

cept thevalueofmax length. Particlesof sample Inc4a,b

have the highest statistical values of the four samples,

except the value of mode length.

Figure 10B also shows that particles of sample

CE2v have the lowest statistical values of the four sam-

ples, except the value of max width. Particles of sample

Inc4a,b have the highest value of maximum width.

COEXISTENCE OF HALLOYSITE AND KAOLINITE

Halloysite and kaolinite coexist in Campo Alegre as

well as in several other kaolin deposits (Murray and

Keller 1993). Why both minerals occur? Is there any

relationshipbetweenhalloysiteandkaolinitewithdiffer-

ent precursors? Are they related to different microenvi-

ronments? Jeong (1998) observed that genetic relation

between the twominerals in theweatheringenvironment

is rarely established.

Felsic rocks of Campo Alegre Basin show little

mineralogicalvariation: sanidineandquartzphenocrysts

areubiquitous; arfvedsonite and ironoxidesmaybepre-

sent; the matrix is a fine-grained quartz feldspar aggre-

gate. As K-feldspar is the major primary alumino-sili-

cate of the rocks, it can be assumed it is the kaolin

precursor. Under conditions of good drainage in the hu-

mid tropics,K-feldsparweathers togivehollow tubesof

halloysite (Parham 1969). Also Banfield and Eggleton

(1990) observed a mineralogical pathway in K-feldspar

weathering, starting in etch pits and cracks with the for-

mation of cell-textured materials of allophane compo-

sition, smectite, a second protocrystalline material and

spherical halloysite. After dissolution formed networks

of cavities, Al and Si precipitated from solution and re-

sulted the growth of tubular halloysite.

The origin of the kaolinite needs other interpreta-

tions. InCampoAlegrekaolindeposits, kaoliniteoccurs

as (iron-rich) stacks filling veins either in the rocks or in

the saprolite, or as tight aggregates in the saprolite. At

Incepa and Oxford Mines also illite and illite-smectite

(inherited from pyroclastic rocks) are mixed in the ma-

trix and could be remaining of a hydrothermal process.

Banfield and Eggleton (1990) showed that kaolinite de-

velops from an illitic material – (Si &gt; Al ? K &gt; Fe) by
crystallizing epitactically. The weathering releases K

and the crystals acquire irregular shape and small quan-

titiesof iron. But there isnomuscoviteor illiticmaterial

at Ceramarte Mine to explain kaolinite origin. In this

case, the veins, where iron-rich kaolinite occurs, aremi-

croenvironments of highly weathered material inherited

fromthe topof theweatheringprofile. Kaoliniteappears

in stackswith small halloysite tubesbetween thekaolin-

ite plates. In an experimental transformation, Singh and

MacKinnon (1996) caused hydrated Georgia kaolinite

plates to roll, forming tubes with both smoothly curved

layers andplanar faces, as is commonlyobserved innat-

ural halloysites. Kaolinite rolling in the solid state was

observed in natural samples by Robertson and Eggle-

ton (1991) ascribed to transitional forms between kaoli-

nite and halloysite. The reverse case, unrolling of hal-

(dashed line) and minimum (lower line) tube lengths and the same statistic

loysite tubes, is also possible. Singh (1996) explained

how the 1:1 structure switches from halloysite to kaoli-

nite: as a result of prolonged dehydration, hydrogen

bonding between layers gradually became stronger, and

the structure shifts from rolling mechanism to tetrahe-

dral rotation,causingtubes toproducelathsbyunrolling.

Wouatong et al. (1996) observed this morphological

transformation (unrolled spherical-shaped halloysite to

tubular and finally unrolled again producing platy kao-

linite) in a granite saprolite. Present study observed the

following sequence of morphological changes in hal-

loysite particles (Fig. 11) in aweatheringprofile: Tubes

– Tubes with planar faces and internal cylindrical holes

– Tubes with planar faces and internal hole with planar

walls-unrolled tubes-plates. Thecorrelationof theforms

with depth is not linear. All the forms occur along the

weathering profile, but the transitional forms between

tubes and plates were observed most frequently in the

samples near the surface.

The end members of the solid-state halloysite to

kaolinite transformation at Campo Alegre basin are low

Hinckley Index and very broad basal peaks kaolinites,

similartotheend-memberskaolinitesdescribedbyJeong

(1998). All observations agree that halloysite is a meta-

stable mineral at Campo Alegre basin, and transform to

stable kaolinite with aging (weathering).

CONCLUSIONS

This study resulted in the following conclusions:

– The kaolin from Campo Alegre Basin is composed

of halloysite (10 Å and 7 Å) and disordered kaoli-

nite. Halloysite content is higher than kaolinite,

except in some veins; low abundant minerals are

quartz, K-feldspar, illite, illite-smectite, vermicu-

lite, anatase, hematite and lepidocrocite.

– K-feldspar weathering is the starting point of the

halloysite formation as hollow tube particles with

planar faces of the tubes with polygonal cross-sec-

tions are due to dehydration.

– Kaolinite is interpreted to have two likely origins:

the weathering of illitic material from pyroclastic

rocks (Incepa and Oxford Mine) and the dehydra-

tion of halloysite at or near the upper part of the

weatheringprofiles. Theobservedsequenceofmor-
