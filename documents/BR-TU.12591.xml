As informações sobre ventos e ondas próximos da costa são dados críticos para os pesquisadores e técnicos que trabalham 
em projetos ligados às áreas de engenharia, geologia e oceanografia costeira, navegação e recreação. Este artigo provê as 
primeiras medidas de ventos e predição de ondas ao longo do litoral da Lagoa dos Patos com base em um ano de dados de 
velocidade de vento e direção, registrados a cada hora, durante todo o ano de 1988. Devido aos ventos nordestes 
prevalecerem no verão e primavera, a direção das ondas dominantes no lado ocidental da laguna é NE e ENE com média das 
alturas de ondas significativas entre 0,5-0,7 m e períodos entre 2,7-3,3 s. No lado oriental da laguna os ventos prevalecentes 
são de WNW e WSW. Durante o inverno e outono, os ventos produzem as maiores alturas máximas na laguna com valores de 
1,6 m e período de 4,8 s, e alturas de ondas significativas entre 0,4-0,8 m e períodos entre 2,4-3,4 s. A alta freqüência dos 
ventos com velocidades entre 0-2 m/s, e sua pequena duração, constituem-se nos principais mecanismos de controle que 
limitam o crescimento das ondas na laguna, sendo a pequena profundidade da ordem de 6 m um fator secundário.

This study provides wave predictions based on accurate wind measurements along the shoreline of Lagoa 

dos Patos, a 240-km-plus-long lagoon. This information addresses the needs of coastal research groups working 

on problems affected by wind and wave conditions in the lagoon, thus helping the design of coastal engineering 

structures, beach restoration and maintenance projects, prediction of the fate of dredging material, and estimation 

of longshore transport rates and coastal erosion patterns (Toldo et al. 2003).  

The lagoon has average length and width of 240 km and 40 km, respectively. It covers a surface of 10,000 

km2, nearly one third the area of the Coastal Plain of the state of Rio Grande do Sul (Fig. 1). The lagoon roughly 

runs NE-SW, with an average depth of almost 6 m, and mean tidal amplitude of 0.45 m. At its southern end, near 

Rio Grande city (Fig. 1), the only inlet of Lagoa dos Patos has a mean discharge of 4,800 m3/s. Sea water 

penetrates northwards into the lagoon up to 200 km during exceptional conditions favored by southern winds, low 

water levels in the lagoon, and spring tides (Martins et al. 1989, Toldo 1989). The lagoon receives freshwater from 

about 170,000 km2, mostly from the catchment basin of the Guaíba River system, whose mouth is located in Porto 

Alegre - the Jacuí Delta - at the northwestern end of the lagoon (Fig. 1). 

The coastal plain bordering the lagoon typically has elevations that reach up to 6 m, mostly consisting of 

sandy deposits interrupted by small inlets (Delaney 1965). Such sandy marginal deposits from the lagoon are all 

related to four Quaternary transgressive events, which developed four depositional systems, mostly consisting of 

barriers and lagoons (Villwock et al. 1986). 

Sand spits are the most important byproducts of the reworking process occurred during the Holocene. Those 

spits rise in average 1 m above the mean water level and on the west margin of the lagoon their submerged part 

extends about 15 km into the water body.

The lagoon has two distinct morphological and sedimentological bottom types. The first region is constituted 

by sandy and narrow margins, whereas the second, larger part is a muddy, nearly flat bottom, both separated by 

depths of five to six meters, which typically separate those two parts of the lagoon. On the west side of the lagoon 

the sandy margin has slopes of about 1/1500, whereas on its east side the slopes are much steeper, reaching 

1/200. The evolution of four barrier-lagoon systems is believed to have formed the different slopes and general 

coastal plain morphology (Tomazelli et al. 2000, Toldo et al. 2000). 

Early work by Instituto de Pesquisas Hidráulicas at  Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul – IPH / 

UFRGS on wind information from Project Lagoa dos Patos was summarized by Almeida et al. (1992). Wave 

prediction work based on such wind data was carried out by Centro de Estudos de Geologia Costeira e Oceânica 

(CECO) and was summarized by Toldo (1994).

Prior to 1988, wave data measurements on Lagoa dos Patos were generally associated with site-specific 

studies, and many of these were visual wave observations provided by commercial ships (Hertz 1977, Toldo 1989). In 

1986, the IPH extended their wind and water level measurement program to the lagoon, obtaining continuous records 

through four stations fitted with anemometers and water level-gauges. The purpose of this program was to provide a 

comprehensive set of wind data from fixed locations. The first two stations were set up along the west side of the 

lagoon near the mainland, both 14 m above the ground. The two other stations were set up by the east side of the 

lagoon, close to its eastern edge, both 6 m above the ground (Fig. 1). Both anemographs were Will Lambrecht’s type. 

Wind measurements around the lagoon were done in a continuous mode from 1986 on, and the data 

acquired in 1988 have been selected for representing the best continuous data series, with wind data presented as 

the time-average velocity at a 1-hour interval. Records include station number, date, wind velocity and direction.

Results from any hindcast numerical wave study rely heavily on the quality of the wind records used in the 

model. In addition to wind data quality, the length of the historical wind record is also an important consideration 

(Hubertz et al. 1991). The only data sources with sufficient recorded time for the present hindcasts are the wind 

measurements carried out by IPH / UFRGS at those four locations along the lagoon. 

All wind data were first corrected to a 10-m elevation, by applying the standard 1/7th power law on the wind 

velocity profile, according to the Shore Protection Manual (1984):

where U10 estimates wind velocity at 10 m from the observed U at elevation Z. The wind velocity measurement 

used in this calculation is the time-average velocity at 1-hour intervals, obtained from the anemogram.  

A correction for differences in air-water temperature (RT, equation 2) and corrections for the difference in 

frictional effects between land and water were applied to obtain the corrected wind velocity (U). The correction for 

surface roughness employed was an approximation to a set of curves, developed by Resio &amp;amp; Vincent (1977), which 

relate the overland-overlake wind velocity ratio to air-water temperature differences and to the overland wind velocity.

Local topography effects (location effect) play no role in this calculation, as the wind velocity data come from 

the water side. Wave growth formulas are expressed in terms of a wind-stress factor, UA, and after the appropriate

The wave model used in this study is described in the Shore Protection Manual (1984). All sea wave 

parameters, such as significant wave height, spectral peak frequency, and mean wave direction, were computed 

for each wave prediction station, at 1-hour intervals during 1988. The mean wave direction was assumed to be the 

same as the wind direction, for the waves under wind influence in the generating area. This decision is based on 

the proximity among the anemographic station and the wave prediction station, which reduces the difference 

between wind direction and wave direction. Also, for the same wind direction, situations presenting wind velocity 

variations up to 3 m/s were separately treated, in order to calculate wave growth.  

Wave growth related to the fetch within the lagoon was also incorporated in the calculations (Shore 

Protection Manual, 1977). The fetch width effect in limiting wave growth was also applied in the wave generation 

routine, as the generated area is limited by the surrounding landforms.  

The correlation between hindcast and measured wave parameters was verified during field work with the 

help of a measuring rod in a 1-m water depth near station 06 (Fig. 1). Readings were made during 5 minutes and 

repeated at a 1-hour interval during 10 hours, on 25th November, 1993. At this day, wind velocity direction and 

duration for wave generation remained steady for 4 hours. Winds blew from ESE, with mean velocity of 5 m/s in the 

first two hours and 7 m/s in the last two hours. Measures from the first two-hour interval indicated a significant wave 

height (Hs) of 0.43 m and period (T) of 2.9 s, whereas in the second interval, the measures were 0.55 m and 3.0 s, 

at a 1.09-m depth. Based on the wave-prediction method (Shore Protection Manual, 1984), respective values of 0.4 

and 0.6 m (Hs), and 2.6 and 3.1 s (T) were calculated, being equivalent for the same depth. In sum, the numbers of 

wave height and period occurrences show good agreement between measured and calculated values, with low 

standard deviation, or ± 0.03, for wave height, and between 0.21-0.07 for the period. In his critical analysis of the 
wave prediction method proposed by the Shore Protection Manual, Bishop et al. (1992) observed similar wave 

results, with wave height values of less than 2 m and periods lower than 6 s.

The results of all wave studies produced by the above hindcasting method are summarized below. Five figures 

and one table were prepared in order to indicate the wave climate at each station for each season in 1988. Wave 

rose diagrams in Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 qualitatively indicate the wind and wave direction frequency distribution for 

each wave prediction station around the lagoon. For a more specific analysis, the hindcasting wave parameters are

The weather of Rio Grande do Sul state in southern Brazil is highly seasonal and strongly related to the large 

scale pressure systems of the Polar Anticyclone in autumn and winter, and the Atlantic Anticyclone in summer and 

spring (Hasenack &amp;amp; Ferraro, 1989). 

Spring and summer cover the period from October to March, with strong and consistent winds on the west 

side of the lagoon, and the surface wind blowing mainly

from the northeast and southeast (Fig. 1 and 4). The autumn and winter season extends from April to September. It 

is the period for the occurrence of the strong and consistent southwest and northwest winds over the east side of 

the lagoon, as observed by Tomazelli (1990) (Figs. 2 and 3).  

Figures 1 to 4 show the frequency of wind measurement and wave prediction data. In the present study, 

wave data with height lower than 0.10 m has not been considered. Those figures show that most winds in the area 

are unable to generate waves greater than 0.10 m. On the west side of the lagoon, the sum of the hours with 

hindcasting waves during 1988 is lower than 91 days for each prediction station (Fig. 5). On the eastern, oceanic 

side, this sum is lower than 40 days. The dominance of weak winds with velocities between 0-2 m/s, and their short 

duration, which is lower than 2 hours, are the main controls limiting wave growth in the lagoon.

With steady winds, an energy versus frequency equilibrium is eventually reached for wave growth, but on the 

lagoon the wave energy growth and propagation is also limited by the shallow water and mainly by the unusual 

fetch characteristics of the lagoon, where the spits provide important limitations to wave growth. For example, after 

1.5 hours, a 35-km fetch and wind-stress velocity of 28 m/s developed waves with height and period of 1.6 m and 

4.8 s, respectively. This was the maximum wave value measured in the lagoon in 1988 and resulted from WNW 

windstorms over wave-prediction station 25 (Fig. 1) in autumn of that year. 

Under strong wind conditions, wind-stress velocities of 14 m/s or more produce storms on the lagoon with 

modal significant wave height and period of 1.0 m and 4.0 s. The sum of hours with storms of such magnitude in 

1988 amounts to 15 days.  

Table 1 shows the period and height distribution for the seasonal prediction from 1988. On the west side of the 

lagoon, during summer and spring, the prediction stations showed high values, with a modal significant wave 

height between 0.5-0.7 m, and period between 2.7-3.3 s, respectively for stations 03 and 11. In contrast, in autumn 

and winter, modal significant wave height and period were lower at those stations, between 0.3-0.5 m, and 1.9-2.7 

s, respectively. On the north side and east oceanic side those values are lower in summer and higher in autumn; 

i.e., prediction stations 25 and 27 showed modal significant wave height and period between 0.2-0.4 m and 2.0-2.3 

s in summer, and between 0.4-0.8 m and 2.4-3.4 s in autumn, respectively.

The following results were obtained from the study of the wave climate along the coastline of Lagoa dos 

Patos: 

1) The hindcast study through wave parameter prediction yielded excellent results and was cost-effective. 

2) The predominant wind direction over the landward west side of the lagoon in summer and spring is NE 

and SE, and on its seaward side in autumn and winter is NW and SW. 

3) The largest calculated wave height was 1.6 m, with a period of 4.8 s, produced by a 28-m/s wind-stress. 

The number of hours with storms; i.e., wave height of 1.0 m or more within the lagoon amounts to 15 days/year. 

4) For all five prediction stations on the west side of the lagoon, summer and spring show modal significant 

wave heights and periods of 0.5 and 0.7 m, and 2.7 and 3.3 s, respectively.

5) On the north and east side of the lagoon, typical modal significant wave heights and periods are between 

0.2-0.4 m and between 2.0-2.6 s for the six prediction stations in summer, and 0.4-0.8 m and 2.4-3.4 s in autumn.
