RESUMO 

Os sumidouros de carbono são reservatórios naturais ou artificiais, nos quais o  

carbono pode ser acumulado durante um determinado período de tempo. Mangais, sapais, 

salinas e pradarias marinhas são habitats que têm um papel importante no balanço de 

carbono dos oceanos e, assim, influenciam o ciclo oceânico. Eles representam um hotspot 

mundial para armazenamento de carbono orgânico (OC). Estes habitats compartilham uma 

parcela excessiva no sequestro de C em relação aos habitats terrestres. Este OC pode ser 

encontrado na biomassa viva especialmente enterrada nos sedimentos. A acumulação de 

OC em sedimentos marinhos fornece armazenamento de C a longo prazo. Esta acumulação 

OC é influenciada por alguns parâmetros ambientais, tais como, por exemplo, a distância ao 

continente e/ou o tamanho de grão e pH, assim como o tipo de ambientes de marés.  

Devido à falta de dados de deposição de carbono na área de estudo e também para 

destacar a importância destes ecossistemas no sequestro de carbono, neste estudo 

pretendeu-se avaliar "sumidouros de C" em relação a estes parâmetros ambientais tais 

como, por exemplo, a hidrodinâmica marinha relativamente à distancia ao continente, ou o 

sedimento, relativamente ao tamanho do grão nas diferentes estações de amostragem. 

Adicionalmente, dois diferentes ecossistemas intertidais da Ria Formosa, Zostera noltii vs 

Spartina marítima, foram avaliados. Esta abordagem multidisciplinar e integrada inclui 

análises biológicas, geológicas e químicas, para melhor compreender os processos que 

conduzem à acumulação de carbono, conservação ou degradação.  

Para tal, foi realizada uma amostragem ao longo de um canal principal e um canal 

secundário da Ria Formosa, em quatro estações diferentes, sendo que em cada estação os 

dois ecossistemas foram amostrados. No laboratório, analisámos as características 

sedimentológicas, onde foi determinado o tamanho das partículas por difração laser e por 

uso de peneiros, com o obejctivo de estimar o nível relativo de energia presente no 

ambiente onde o sedimento foi transportado e depositado. A cor dos sedimentos foi 

analisada em todo o espectro de luz visível por reflectância difusa, permitindo-nos adquirir 

uma aproximação da composição do sedimento. Também foi estudada a composição 

mineralógica por difração de raios-X. Por outro lado, foram analisadas as características 

geoquímicas, o que incluiu a determinação da matéria orgânica e carbonato perdidos por

combustão, análise de composição elementar (OC, IC, IN e ON) através de um sistema de 

combustão elementar e o raio de C/N foi calculado, para ter uma ideia aproximada da 

origem ou fonte da matéria orgânica. Também foi determinada a concentração de 

pigmentos, onde por um lado foram analisadas as concentrações de clorofila e carotenóides, 

usando uma extração simples com acetona e medidas as concentrações através do 

espectrofotómetro. Seguidamente, através de cromatografia HPLC, foram analisados os 

pigmentos específicos. Os resultados destas últimas análises foram, no entanto, não 

representativos, uma vez que os valores obtidos apresentavam artefactos de degradação, 

não tendo sido considerados.  

O processamento de dados foi realizado utilizando o software estatístico R. Todas 

as propriedades físicas e bioquímicas de sedimentos foram avaliadas para cada estação e 

para cada tipo de habitat, avaliando a sua variabilidade. Um estudo ANOVA de dois 

fatores, sendo um de eles ‘estação’ e o outro ‘tipo de comunidade biológica’, foi aplicado a 

cada variável, de modo a saber se houve ou não diferenças significativas dependentes de 

cada fator individualmente ou devido ao efeito da interferência de ambos. Nos casos em 

que se verificaram diferenças, foi usado um post-hoc para determinar a origem da 

diferença, neste caso usamos o teste de Tukey. O software Gradistat, foi utilizado para 

calcular o cálculo estatístico do tamanho de grão.  

Nos resultados em relação às características sedimentológicas, o tamanho da 

partícula reflete um gradiente em que o tamanho do grão nas amostras diminui à medida 

que nos afastamos do canal principal e nos aproximamos das estações do canal secundário. 

Este gradiente é mais marcado no caso da Z. noltii do que no da S. maritima. Esta diferença 

na intensidade do gradiente entre ambos ambientes pode ser devido às diferenças de 

hidrodinamismo entre os dois meios, uma vez que a Z. noltii está mais exposta que a S. 

maritma devido à sua posição no intertidal. Relativamente aos resultados de cor, foi 

observada a possível presença de várias formas de Fe e goetita devido aos tons do 

sedimento, apresentando um aumento em ambos os valores ou aumentado o conteúdo 

dessas substâncias da estação 1 para a 4 para ambos os ambientes. No composição mineral 

verificaram-se diferenças entre o teor de quartzo e polissilicatos entre as estações, 

aumentando o conteúdo de polissilicatos e redução do teor de quartzo nas estações mais

protegidas. Também a presença de pirita e siderita poderia explicar os altos valores de 

matéria orgânica, ao proporcionar um possível ambiente redutor. 

 Um grande conteúdo em carbonatos foi encontrado na estação 4, podendo explicar-

se devido à possível presença de foraminíferos. Em relação ao sequestro dos carbonos, é 

influenciado por praticamente todas as variáveis estudadas, já que influenciam as 

características do solo, favorecendo ou desfavorecendo a acumulação de carbono. Como 

por exemplo a presença de determinados compostos minerais ou substâncias que foram 

determinadas na análise da composição mineral e cor, que favorecem a agregação de 

matéria orgânica, ou outras resultando em condições reduzidas permitindo que ocorra uma 

maior acumulação no sedimento. Nem todas as variáveis mostram o mesmo padrão ou 

tendência relativamente às estações ou ao tipo de comunidade biológica. Para todas as 

variáveis estudadas neste trabalho, apenas algumas delas não apresentaram variações em 

ambos os fatores estudados. A melhoria destas representam diferenças entre estação e entre 

ambientes e mais da metade respondem à interação deles. Atendendo ao objetivo principal 

deste estudo, foram encontradas diferenças significativas entre os dois ambientes, 

mostrando a S. maritima aproximadamente o dobro do conteúdo de carbono do que a Z. 

noltii. Esta variabilidade foi relacionada com o tamanho do grão, observando-se uma 

relação positiva entre a concentração de carbono orgânico e a presença de sedimentos mais 

finos. Todos os fatores encontram-se influenciados pela composição do solo e 

hidrodinâmica. Finalmente, quando foi calculada a taxa da acumulação do carbono, S. 

maritima acumula dobro do que a Z. noltii, com resultais de valores de 131.8 g OC.m

  Abstract

ABSTRACT 

Carbon sinks are natural or artificial reservoirs in which carbon can be accumulated 

for a certain length of time. Mangroves, salt marshes and seagrasses beds are habitats that 

have an important role on the carbon budget of the oceans and thus influence the oceanic 

cycle. In this study we aimed is to evaluate C storage capacity of two different intertidal 

environments, Zostera noltii vs Spartina maritima from Ria Formosa, as well as to 

evaluate the influence of hydrodynamics and sediment grain size in the C storage. This 

multidisciplinary and integrated approach includes biological, geological and chemical 

analyses in order to better understand the processes leading to Carbon accumulation in 

sediments. For such a purpose, we analyzed and measured the granulometry, color and 

mineral composition of the sediment, as well as the organic matter, calcium carbonate 

contents and the elemental composition. The results obtained reflect that the carbon 

sequestration (organic carbon content), is related to practically all the studied variables, 

Furthermore, there are significant differences between both biological communities. S. 

maritima shows nearly twice the organic carbon content than Z. noltii. On the other hand, 

the distance to the main navigation channel, a proxy to hydrodynamics, affected all 

parameters, strongly affected C accumulation, with higher variability in Z. noltii than S. 

mariima. C accumulation and sediment grain size were related to this gradient, as 

expected, where both parameters increased from the first station, close to the main channel, 

to last station the most remote. The carbon accumulation rate for S. maritima environment 

was twice as high as those for Z. noltii environment, 131.8 g OC.m

1. Introduction 

1.1. Carbon cycle in marine systems. 

The carbon cycle has two important parts. One part is the biological pump, i.e. 

redistribution of biologically active elements such as carbon, nitrogen and silica in the 

ocean waters and the second part is the removal of these by deposition and burial in 

sediments. The formation of organic matter (OM) and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) allows 

part of the carbon that is fixed by plankton to sink toward the deep ocean and is stored and 

buried for long periods of time before returning to the atmosphere (Sanchez et al., 2013). 

This accumulation and sequestration of carbon is known as biological carbon sink, 

whenever CO2 emission is lower than its inputs (Diaz., 2014). The ocean is considered an 

important carbon sink, which is referred commonly as Blue carbon (Nellemann et al., 

2009). The publication of the Blue carbon report by Nellemann and co-authors (2009) 

showed the importance of the marine ecosystems in carbon sequestration. Coastal Marine 

ecosystems such as Mangroves, saltmarshes and seagrass beds particularly show an 

elevated carbon sequestration with relation to their global area (Laffley and Grimsditch, 

2009). Recent data estimates that these ecosystems are responsible for capturing up to 70% 

of the organic carbon from the marine environment (Nellemann et al., 2009). These 

ecosystems have a great capacity to sequester and store important amounts of carbon in 

their sediments. About 20% of the global carbon sequestration is retained by these 

ecosystems despite occupying only 0.1% of the ocean surface (Duarte et al., 2013). 

Seagrass meadows bury carbon at a rate 35 times greater than the terrestrial 

ecosystems e.g. the tropical forests (McLeod et al., 2011).  Furthermore, there is a 

difference between the accumulation time of carbon in the terrestrial forests when 

compared to seagrass meadows, ranging from decades to thousands of years respectively 

(Macreadie et al., 2014). These ecosystems are adapted to marine life and can be found 

both permanently or temporarily submerged (Duarte et al., 2013). They provide many 

ecosystem services. For example, tidal salt marshes protect coastal fisheries of physical 

energy of the sea and provide shelter for juvenile fish. They provide valuable habitat for a 

lot of plants, birds and others animals, whose can serve as food resources. They also 



  Introduction

provide services and supplies to recreational hunters and fisher, many of which can give 

indirect economic benefits. They also offer protection from storm surges (Chmura., 2013). 

With respect to the accumulation of carbon in seagrass meadows, it is due to 

breaches, stems and leaves (above-ground biomass), roots (below-ground biomass), and 

litter and dead wood (non-living biomass) (Grimsdith et al., 2013), as well as to 

sedimentary organic and inorganic constituents such as bacteria, microalgae, macro algae, 

detritus and carbonates respectively (Macreadie et al., 2014). This carbon is stored over 

millennia in the sediments.  In addition, like the sea level rise, their sediments continue to 

accrete vertically, and hence do not become saturated with organic carbon; unlike 

terrestrial ecosystems that reach soil carbon equilibrium with time (centuries or millions of 

years) (Grimsdith et al., 2013).  

Another explanation of the high carbon storage capacity of these environments is 

their capacity of acting as particulate traps. They develop large canopies that affect the 

flow of water existing above them, which in turn can modify their environmental abiotic 

conditions. One consequence of this develop of canopies is the accumulation of sediment 

and decreasing the resuspension of particles in the background. The formation of these 

canopies favors effectiveness of benthic subtracts, increasing the deposition surface of the 

sediment and probability of contact. Another characteristic that increases carbon 

accumulation is the presence of epiphytes on the leaves, because they increase the 

roughness of the leaves (Duarte et al., 2013). Thus, the coastal marine sediments are 

extremely rich and contain the majority of blue carbon (Grimsdith et al., 2013). 

To understand this capacity to sequester and store of carbon in the sediment of 

theses ecosystems, it is important to define carbon stock  in an ecosystem,  as the amount 

of carbon stored, which is altered by having accumulation or release carbon in that 

ecosystem (Macreadie et al., 2014).  For example, the accumulation of carbon as 

carbohydrates in the rhizomes can be used by the plant for respiration, or released in the 

sediments, where the secondary microbial production is supported. The carbon structure of 

the leaves is decomposed by bacteria and recycled by seawater. These two forms of carbon 

accumulation have a short residence time and thus cannot be considered part of the carbon 

stock. However, as the roots and rhizomes carry out their growth in the sediments under 



  Introduction 

3 
 

anoxic conditions, they have a low nutritional value for the bacteria (Macreadie et al., 

2014). This low interest is due to the low concentration of nutrients (nitrogen and 

phosphorus) in their tissues (Duarte et al., 2013), so their decomposition is very slow and 

thus they accumulate in the sediments along large periods of time and can hence be 

considered as part of the carbon stock (Macreadie et al., 2014). Some authors have defined 

that 80% of the production of seagrass is not consumed by herbivorous and the rate of 

decomposition of this detritus is very low (Duarte et al., 2013). In terms of environmental 

factors affecting C capture and storage by seagrass,  Macreadie and co-authors (2012) 

proposed some effects such as that of altered physical-chemical states on remineralization 

rates and the role of bioturbation fauna in facilitating mechanical flux of buried C out of 

sediment (role of microbial communities, also known as early diagenesis). 

In summary, the high carbon storage capacity of seagrass has been explained 

because of its high primary production, its high capacity to filter out particles from water 

column and its high sediment retention capability. All this combines with a slow rate of 

decomposition in a seagrass environment low oxygen sediment and the lack of fires 

underwater (Fourqurean et al., 2012).  

On the other hand, there is also an important variation in the carbon capture and 

storage between species. Carbon sequestration will vary according to their different rates 

of primary production, their ability to trap allochthones carbon through their canopies, the 

recalcitrance of the OC in their organs and in accordance with the characteristics of its 

preservation in sediments. In addition, the sp-habitat interactions influence carbon 

sequestration such as latitudinal, habitat ranges of temperature variations, sediment type, 

respiration in the sediment and remineralization (Labery et al., 2013). For example, the 

biochemical composition of the cell wall and other exterior cellular components among the 

seagrass meadows are probably different when looking at a high detailed level. These 

differences may require changes in microbial enzymatic processes of different 

dissimilative bacteria or fungi (Zak et al., 2006). In fact, one sediment profile can result 

from both aerobic and anaerobic processes. Different suites of microbes and microbial 

digestive systems may occur depending on the ecology of habitats, with differences 

between tropical and temperate habitats (Hoppe et al., 2002).  Therefore, the integration of 



  Introduction 

4 
 

different environmental, chemical and biological factors is of fundamental importance in 

order to decipher their influence on the carbon storage capacity of seagrass. Understanding 

the causes for the high capacity of seagrass to capture and store carbon is fundamental to 

manage these ecosystems. Therefore, the seagrass may be even more important to the 

oceanic C cycle than previously considered (Fourqurean et al., 2012). 

During recent times, close to 30% of seagrass area worldwide has been destroyed 

(Waycott et al., 2009), which is a major loss of C sink. Increasing the concern of large C 

leaks to the atmosphere, and thus accelerating climate warming. Current global rates of 

global loss of these ecosystems are calculated to be 0.7–2% per year (Grimsdith et al., 

2013), among the  highest rates of any ecosystem on the planet. This loss of seagrass C 

stocks, like terrestrial environments, is also due to anthropogenic disturbances either 

directly or indirectly. Indeed, sediments can be dredged, but the most common cause of 

seagrass disappearance is the degradation of water quality (Fourqurean et al., 2012). Thus, 

when these ecosystems are degraded or destroyed, large emissions of carbon dioxide are 

produced. This source of carbon dioxide is caused by the oxidation of carbon in biomass 

and organic content of sediment. This process occurs in the decade after the disturbance, 

but continues with the continuous oxidation of carbon that has been accumulated in the 

sediments for millennia (Grimsdith et al., 2013). Such a loss also means a decrease in its 

services to the ecosystem, such as symbiotic habitat and nutritional base for fish, shellfish 

and others animals. Another important function being lost with the loss of these 

ecosystems is the stabilization of bottom sediments, cleaning of the water to the sediments 

and nutrients suspended in water (Touchette and Burkholder, 2000).  

In addition, the most pervasive threat to the remaining area of salt marsh is 

probably accelerated sea level rise. Implications of this threat are increasing duration of 

tidal flooding, limiting vegetation production at the lower elevations along the seaward 

edge of the marsh and the possible disappearance of these marshes due to landward lateral 

accretion (Chmura., 2013). 

According to previous studies the vast majority of database on organic carbon (OC) 

in seagrass are referred to North America, Western Europe and Australia. In South 

America and Africa there is remarkably fewer data, as well as in the tropical Indo-Pacific 



  Introduction 

5 
 

or southern Europe and thus, given the large spatial extent of seagrass, few data is 

effectively known (Fourqurean et al., 2012). 

Because the collected data attributed to the capture of OC in seagrass is very 

limited, it tends to base almost all the estimates in OC content of oceanic sediments from 

the Mediterranean Posidonea oceanica meadows. The P. oceanica however is unusual in 

its ability to capture C because it can extend several meters below the sediment and persist 

for thousands of years, which is a massive storage of C. From what it is known so far, there 

is no other marine grass that has these characteristics. Nellemann and co-authors (2009) 

recognized that an upper estimate of Blue Carbon sink might exist, which could be due to 

uncertainties in accumulation rates of different seagrass ecosystems (Lavery et al., 2013). 

 

1.2. Characterization of the Ria Formosa. 

The studied zone is located in a shallow mesotidal lagoon system with a surface 

area of close 84 km
2 

on the south coast of Portugal (Guimarães et al., 2012). It has 

important natural biogeochemical cycles regulated by tidal exchanges at the seawater 

boundaries and at the sediment interface (Newton et al., 2003) and producing highly 

productive tidal environment (Friend et al., 2003). This area can be thus classified as rich 

ecosystem thanks to its lagoon system and barrier islands and its physic-chemical, 

biological and geological characteristics. 

This lagoon system named Ria Formosa is separated from the sea by a 55 km long 

barrier islands chain which is characterized by the presence of coastal landscapes such as 

beaches, coastlines of sand barriers, marshes and dunes. Furthermore, Ria Formosa 

habitats have a varying stability from cohesive to non-cohesive sediments (Friend et al., 

2003), as it is composed of sand, mud and muddy sands. 

The main habitat of Ria Formosa consists of an intertidal zone of about 30 km long 

and an elevation of 0.4-0.5m above the mean sea level. Andrade (1990) distinguishes three 

types of intertidal flat, according to distinctive characteristics, such as elevation, sediment 

type and position within the lagoon system: 



  Introduction 

6 
 

- Back-barrier flats located behind the spits: Due to their weak hydrodynamic 

regime, they consist of fine sediment, and are located at a higher elevation than the other 

types; 

- Flood-delta flats corresponding to the innermost part of tidal inlets: They are 

essentially sand deposits, often covered by bed forms generated during the flood tide;  

- Creek-edge flats as the most common type across the lagoon:  They are located 

along main channels and secondary creeks furthest away from the inlets. 

In the lagoon, a distinctive sediment zonation is found moving across the profile 

from the lower to the upper intertidal environment, with a fining upward trend of the 

sediments (Friend et al., 2003). Saltmarshes are found at ever increasing density as one 

moves away from the inlets. 

The dynamics of the lagoon is dominated by the exchange of water at six entry points 

linking the lagoon to ocean and coastal ecosystems. 

From a more general point of view, Ria Formosa has an average depth of 2 m and a 

tidal range that varies from a maximum of 3.7 m in spring to a minimum of 0.4 m. The 

salinity values are in a range between 35.5 and 36.9 throughout the year, except during 

periods of intense rain and thus salinity may be less than 15. The water temperature varies 

from 12 ° C to 27 ° C (winter to summer, respectively) (Friend et al., 2003). 

The aquatic vegetation of the Ria Formosa is distributed spatially in relation to the 

elevation of the tide. Saltmarsh species such as Spartina marítima and Sarcocornia 

pernneisse are found in the upper intertidal area that is only flooded during high tides. 

Zostera noltii seagrass beds, green (Enteromorpha spp, Ulva spp) and brown (Fucus 

versiculosus) macroalgal mats are found in the lower intertidal flats (Friend et al., 2003).

1.3. Objective of the present study. 

Since until now, there have been no studies on carbon accumulation in this 

environments in the Ria Formosa coastal lagoon system, Southern Portugal, the present 

study aims to fulfil this lack of information and thus to study the importance of the C 

stocks in two different environments. 

Accordingly, the main objective of the present study is to evaluate C and N storage 

capacity of two different intertidal environments, Z. noltii vs S .maritima from Ria 

Formosa, as well as to evaluate the influence of environmental parameters such as the 

sediment grain size, which is a proxy of hydrodynamics. 

In order to reach this main objective, the following questions will be assessed:  

- Is there a difference in C sequestration between S. maritima and Z. noltii habitats? 

- What is the relation between OC content and the sediment granulometry? 

- What is the relation between OC content and the sediment color? 

- What is the relation between the ON and the OC? 

- Is there a relationship between the concentrations of pigments and C sink?  

This is thus a multidisciplinary and integrated approach that includes biological, 

geological and chemical analyses in order to better understand the processes leading to 

carbon accumulation, conservation or degradation.

2.1. Sampling sediment in the Ria Formosa 

 

 

Figure 2.1: Sampling sediments in the Ria Formosa in a Z. noltii zone (left) and transportation between 

stations (right). 

The sampling was carried out in the main channel and in a tributary channel of Ria 

Formosa Lagoon system (Fig. 2.1), in four different stations according to a transect along 

the tributary channel. Stations coordinates are the following (Fig. 2.2): 

- Station 1 (36º58’56.65’’N ; 7º53’16.56’’W) 

- Station 2 (36º59’20.51’’N ; 7º52’33.08’’W)  

- Station 3 (36º59’56.88’’N ; 7º52’45.08’’W)  

- Station 4 (37º00’08.22’’N ; 7º52’53.72’’W)

Stations were numbered Station 1 to Station 4. Image obtained from Google Earth (lower image). 

 

At each station, two different environments, namely with Z. noltii or S. maritima, 

were sampled in order to assess the variability in organic carbon (Corg) stock in the 

respective sediments. Four replicates of each sample were collected using 2.5 cm diameter 

syringes pushed 8 times into the top 5 cm of the sediment (Fig. 2.3).

Station 4 was sampled before S. maritima sample from station 3 was collected due 

fast tidal inundation at station 4. 

A calibrated portable pH meter was used to measure in situ pH (NBS scale) at each 

sampling station. Temperature and salinity were also measured alongside with pH readings 

(Table 1 in the Annex 1). No measurements of Station 3 for S. maritima because the tide 

was already high 

Around 25 ml of each sample replicate was sub-sampled onboard the boat into 50 

ml falcon previously prepared for liquid nitrogen freezing. These subsamples were then put 

into the -80ºC freezer at University arrival. The other samples were maintained in the 

fridge at 6 °C. 

 

2.2. Laboratory work. 

The laboratory analyses required for a basic assessment of C stocks consisted into 

two distinct analyses: 

- Sedimentological Analyses. 

- Geochemical Analyses. 

Figure 2.4 illustrates the processes carried out in the laboratory for each sample.

2.2.1. Sediment Analysis. 

In this analysis the granulometry, the color determination and the mineral 

composition of the sediment were measured, with the following procedures: 

2.2.1.a. Sediment granulometry by laser counting and sieving. 

Fine particle grain size analysis was performed using a diffraction laser particle- 

size analyzer, namely through a Mastersize 2000 model APA of 2000 of ©Malvern 

Instruments Ltd., showed in the figure 2.5.   

 
Figure 2.5: Picture showing the Mastersize 2000 model APA of 2000 of ©Malvern Instruments Ltd. 

This technique is based on the assumption that a particle diameter is equivalent to a 

sphere that gives the same diffraction as the particle does. This method sees the particle as 

a two-dimensional object and gives its grain size as a function of the cross-sectional area of 

that particle (Konert et al. 1997).  

 The Malvern equipment measures the angle variation intensity of light scattered as 

a laser beam passes through the sample dispersed in water.  Hence large particles scatter 

light at small angles relative to the laser beam and small particles scatter light at large 

angles. So to calculate the particles size, the angular scattering intensity data is analyzed. 

The device has 52 detectors located at different positions. This set of detectors 

generates a distribution of light intensity. Each detector element emits a signal, which is 

amplified and digitalized, to an electronic measuring system. This is transferred to a 



  Materials and methods 

13 
 

computer that is appropriate to their analysis using the appropriate software (Gázquez., 

2011) in this case the Mastersizer Micro software. 

To perform the granulometry we have to prepare 20 L of helix water with an 

additional 20 g of Sodium Polyphosphate PRS (NaPO3) n to disperse the grains. The 

solution was shacked for 15 min to allow dilution. 

 A day before performing the granulometry, all samples were prepared in 

precipitating glasses of 250 ml, by mixing a small amount of sample (a small spoon) with a 

the solution described above. The roots and plant debris were removed with tweezers as far 

as possible, because in the Malvern method these elements can induce errors. 

Two analyses were made, one in which the samples still contained their organic 

matter content and the other after its removal using peroxide (H2O2). This last process is 

slow, needing several days for a complete oxidation of the organic matter. 

This analysis allowed estimating the relative energy level present in the 

environment when the sediment was transported and deposited.  

On the other hand, fine to coarse grain ratio was done using a sieve sequence of 1 

mm and 63 ?? mesh. This allowed assessing the proportion of sand present in each sample 

(Fig. 2.6). 

 

Figure 2.6:  Sediment granulometry by the sieving process for evaluating the coarse grain ratio. 

 

2.2.1.b. Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy for color determination. 

Visible light diffused reflectance spectra was determined with a spectrophotometer 

Colortron
TM

. This spectrophotometer is a device that measures the color at the surface of 



  Materials and methods 

14 
 

solids and transfers it to the ColorshopTM program. This technique can use various color 

scales such as CIE Lab, CIE RGB, CIE XYZ, among other scales. 

In this study of color we used the CIE L * a * b * system (Commission 

International de l'Eclairage) designed in 1976. Where: L* axis is the lightness, the 

minimum value being 0 (black) and maximum 100 (white); a* axis from red (positive 

values) to green (negative values) or zero (neutral); b * axis from yellow (positive values) 

to blue (negative values) or zero (neutral).  

Diffuse reflectance spectrophotometry (DRS) is a rapid and nondestructive 

technique, which is based on the percent reflectance of a sample relative to white light (e.g. 

Font et al., 2013.) 

The device is designed to scan the light reflected from the sample surface, using a 

white standard such as barium sulfate. With the characteristic spectral signature of some 

minerals of geological materials in this wavelength range may be qualified (Balsam and 

Deaton, 1991) and quantified (Balsan and Deaton, 1996) or even identified (Balsam et al., 

1998) namely for materials from the VIS spectrum (metal oxides, hydroxides and sulfides). 

Two analysis were made, one in which the samples still contained organic matter 

and the other after removal of organic matter using H2O2.  Color fluctuates in function of 

grain size, the sediment composition and humidity, hence three measurements were done 

on each sample in order to account for the sample heterogeneity.  

2.2.1.c.  Mineral identification. 

The mineralogy of each sample was determined using a X- Ray Diffractometer 

“X´pert” (Fig. 2.7) as described in Pozo et al. (2010). This will allow determining the 

origin of the mineral fraction (detrital vs antigenic).  

 



  Materials and methods

Figure 2.7: Full X- Ray Diffractometer “X´pert” (left) and its autosampler (right). 

 

X-ray diffraction (XRD) is the primary, non-destructive tool for identifying and 

quantifying the mineralogy of crystalline compounds. Every mineral or compound has a 

characteristic X-ray diffraction pattern whose 'fingerprint' can be matched against a 

database.  The diffraction traces produced by individual constituents and highly complex 

mixtures can be interpreted by modern computer-controlled diffraction systems. 

Monochromatic X-rays are projected onto a crystalline material at a characteristic 

angle (?). Diffraction occurs when the distance traveled by the rays reflected from 

successive planes differs by an integer (n) of wavelengths (?) (British geological Survey, 

2015). 

Around 2 g of sediment were placed in two containers grinding with 6 ml of 

alcohol. The mixture was ground for 10 min. Once ground, the content was poured into a 

petri plate. The petri allowed to dry the powder in an oven. Sample was then homogenized 

in an agate mortar and finally, in order to start the measurement, the sample was placed on 

own supports for analyzing RX. (Fig. 2.8) 

Figure 2.8: The figure shows the process carried out for each sample for mineralogical analysis as described 

in the text, namely: the grounding equipment, the two containers and resulting wet fine sediment, the drying 

petri dishes in the oven and the agate mortar.

 2.2.2. Geochemical analysis: 

At first, each sample was weighed (P total) and its density (g ml
-1

) was calculated 

as the weight divided by the total sampled sediment volume.  

Samples were weighted before (P1) and after lyophylization (P2), which was 

realized using Savant lyophilizer Module. The process consisted in lyophilizing the 

samples during 42 h to remove the water. The percentage of water was then calculated 

based on the weight difference.  

After the lyophilization, the samples were passed through a sieve of 1mm in order 

to assess the vegetables percentage (P3). Dried and sieved samples were then homogenized 

using a ball mill (FRITSCH, planetary micro mil, pulverisette 7) (Fig. 2.9). Samples were 

split into two parts, or subsamples in order to analyze their Elemental composition, and to 

determinate their organic matter and carbonate contents

containers with balls (left), ball mill equipment (center), resulting powders (right). 

 

2.2.2.a.  Determination of Organic matter and carbonate contents by Loss of Ignition. 

   First, about 1.5g of dried and homogenized sample was weighted to know the 

exact weight (P4) before burning. Then samples were burnt to ash in a furnace at 450
? 
C for 

2 hours, and the burnt samples were then weighted (P5) again to obtain the percentage of 

organic matter by differences of weights. In the next step, samples were burnt at 950ºC for 



  Materials and methods 

17 
 

2 hours and then weighted (P6) again to obtain the percentage of carbonates by weight 

differences. 

 

2.2.2.b. Determination of Elemental composition: OC, IC, ON, IN and C/N. 

  The measurement of carbon and nitrogen contents in sediment was done following 

procedures described by Campbell and co-authors (2014), using a Costech 410 Elemental 

Analyzer (Fig. 2.10). 

 

Figure 2.10: The Costech 410 Elemental Analyzer. 

The Elemental Combustion System is based on an automatic analytical unit whose 

operation, from sampling to signal detection, is microprocessor controlled. Helium carrier 

gas circulates within the analytical circuit which consists of a combustion reactor for 

Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen and Sulfur (CHNS) or a pyrolysis reactor for Oxygen. The 

carrier gas brings the products of combustion or pyrolysis to a gas chromatographic 

separation column and TCD detector for CHNS-O analysis (Costech, Analytical 

Tecnologies. 2014). 

For this analysis, the sample was weighted into a tin capsule and introduced into 

oxygen-rich environment through an auto-sampler, and then the combustion process 

occurs. After the entire sample combustion, the gases (N2, CO2 and H2) are irreversibly 

adsorbed, and each component is determined in thermal conductivity detector. 



  Materials and methods 

18 
 

The reactions (Formula 2.1) involved in combustion process are based on the 

following reaction: 

R-N + O2            N2 + NO x + O2 + CO + CO2 + CH4 + X- + SO x + H2O (Formula 2.1) 

At the end of the analysis, results of the sample composition are given in CHN total 

proportion between 0.01% and 100% of dry weight. 

Once the total CHN obtained, samples witch were burnt to ash in a furnace at 450
? 

C, (samples without organic matter) had to be analyzed using the Costech 410 Elemental 

Analyzer the samples in order to obtain the CHN inorganic content. Hence the organic 

carbon (OC) was calculated (expressed in units of % dry weight) as: OC = TC – IC 

(Formula 2.2) 

After analyzing the elemental composition, to have an idea or first approximation 

of the source of the material composing the sediment was calculated C / N ratio. 

 

2.2.2.c. Determination of Pigment contents. 

During the sedimentary pigment analysis the sediment was been protected against 

direct light and excessive warning to avoid the degradation of the pigments. Samples were 

freeze dried at -80ºC. Three tests were done in order to know the sediment concentration 

that would be necessary to have for significate pigment concentration. 150 mg, 0.5g, 1.5g, 

3g and 2g was analyzed. In the case of 3 g there was too much sediment, so the extraction 

was impossible to do. Finally 150mg of sediment were used to do the analysis. The 

extraction was done and expressed as Sanger and Gorham (1972) modified as Lami and 

Buchaca (2002).

19 
 

Pigment extraction was been carried out from 150 mg of dry sediment sonicated 

with 2 ml of 100% acetone for 40 seconds and  then the sample was centrifuged around 10 

minutes at 3000rpm. Supernatant was taken, and the process was repeated the same form 

one more time. Finally, the 4 ml was filtered with a filter of 0.22 µm pore diameter to 

determinate the chlorophyll derivatives (CD) and the total carotenoids (TC) (Fig. 2.11). 

The filtered solution was measured immediately in a spectrophotometer UV / 

Visible, Beckman Coulter, Du´650 (Fig. 2.12).  

 

 

Figure 2.12: Spectrophotometer UV / Visible, Beckman Coulter, Du´650. 

The spectrophotometer uses the properties of light and its interaction with other 

substances, to determine the nature of the same. In general, light from special lamp 

characteristics is guided through a device that selects and separates light of a particular 

wavelength and passes through a sample. The intensity of light leaving the sample is 

captured and compared to the intensity of light that penetrated the sample and from this the 

transmittance of the sample is calculated. It allows to determine the concentration of a 

substance (in this case the determinate the chlorophyll derivatives (CD) and the total 

carotenoids (TC)) in a solution, allowing the realization of quantitative analysis. 

On the other hand specific pigments were determined by ion pairing, reverse-phase 

HPLC in Centre of Marine Science (CCMAR) by the Marine Plant Ecology group, 

University of Gambelas, Faro.

2.3. Statistic Analysis. 

Data processing was focused on characterizing and understanding the C 

concentration present in the surface sediment, with respect to the geochemical and 

sedimentological differences and physical properties of the four studied stations in both 

environments (Z. noltii and S. maritima). The data processing was performed through the 

statistical software R. This software is an open source language and programming. It seeks 

to explain correlations and dependencies of a physical or natural phenomenon occurring 

randomly or conditionally, i.e., it is a language and environment for statistical and 

graphical analysis. 

 An exploratory data analysis was performed from graphical representation of 

boxplot, biplot and correlations of variables to better understand the trend of the data. Two 

way ANOVAs with station and type of environment as factors were also performed for 

each variable to see whether or not there are significant effects of each independent factor 

and of their interaction. In the case of significant difference, a post hoc analysis was 

applied to determine where the difference was localize, in this case we used Tukey test. 

In addition, it is important to note that  Gradistat program (Blot and Pye., 2001) 

was also used to do the calculation of grain size statistics based on Folk and Ward (1957) 

including: mean, mode(s), sorting (standard deviation), skewness, kurtosis, and a range of 

cumulative percentile values (the grain size at which a specified percentage of the grains 

are coarser)

3.1. Sediment Analysis: 

3.1.3. Sediment granulometry by laser counting and sieving. 

  The grain size results are presented in Table 2.I in Annex 2. The textural 

composition of the samples varies between 5 and 25 % wv of clay (Fig. 3.1), 1 and 16 % 

wv of silt and 7 and 88 % wv of sand. The grain size of samples after removing the organic 

matter range 17.80 – 126.70 µm, with an average of 56 µm whereas the grain size of 

samples with organic matter range 21.34 – 1007.30 µm, with an average of 69.47 µm.  The 

coarser sediment is found in station 1 for Z. noltii environment, whereas the finest 

sediment is from station 4 also in Z. noltii environment. Thus a progressive grain size 

diminution from station 1 to station 4 was observed, as well as a higher variability in Z. 

noltii than S. maritima. It is important to note that this gradient is mainly observed in the 

granulometry made on samples after removing the organic matter.

In a similar manner as seen for the Clay content from the sediment without organic 

matter (“Mineral Clay”), the fine/coarse ratio (Fig. 3.2) shows the same observed trend 

from station 1 to 4 with ratios varying from 1 to 6, but this time in both environments. 

Figure 3.2: Percentage Fine/Coarse in function of sampling station for each species. 

This similarity in trends can be verified in the high correlations observed between 

the two variables, being higher for Z .noltii than S. maritima with a value of 88% of 

correlation (Fig. 3.3), compared with a value of 44 % for S. maritima (Fig. 3.4).

When observing the `particle size distribution classification’ (PSDC) of sediment 

type based on the proportions of sand, silt and clay, which are plotted as a ternary diagram 

in Fig. 3.5, the classification correspond with the progressive grainsize diminution in Z. 

noltii, environment from station 1, with a high percentage of sand, to station 4, with a 

higher percentage of silt Fig. 3.5 (A), whereas S. maritima environment shows a smaller 

gradient, being able to group the stations 1 and 2 on one hand and 3 and 4 on the other 

(Fig. 3.5 (B). 

Nevertheless, both environments are characterized by silty sand in station 1 and silt 

in station 4, even though S. maritima environments show slightly coarser sediment due to a 

higher content of silt in relation to the clay content.

3.1.2. Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy for color determination. 

Color results obtained in each of the treatments are summarized in Table 2.V in the 

Annex 2. L* measured in the samples with organic matter (L*) has a range of variation 

between 47.08 and 66.40, whereas L* measured in samples after removing the organic 

matter (L*.no.OM) varies between 0 and 20.50. Similarly, a* varies from -2 to 3.06 and 

a*.no.OM between 0 and 47.08 whereas b* ranges from 16.28 to 33.70 and b* no.OM 

from 0 to 99.72 (see table2.V in annex 2). 

These results clearly show differences between samples containing organic matter 

and samples after removal of organic matter. 

The results of the analyzed samples that contained organic matter, show that the a* 

color present significant difference (ANOVA, p&lt;0.001) between the Z. noltii environment 

and S. maritima environment. The highest values are found in Z. noltii environment and 

the smallest values in S. maritima (Fig.3.6). In the case of S. maritima environments values 

are below 0, thus colors with a green component, whereas for Z. noltii environments values 

are above 0, corresponding to a red component.

samples after organic matter removal, showing no significant differences (ANOVA, p 

&gt;0.05) by environments, i.e. there are no significant changes in these color components. 

When observing the results of the analyzed samples after removal of the organic 

matter, both a*no.OM (ANOVA, p&lt;0.001) (Fig.3.7) and b*no.OM (ANOVA, p&lt;0.001) 

(Fig.3.8) colors show differences in function of the sampling station for each specie and 

between species. High values for both colors are registered in station 1 for S. maritima 

environment, whereas station 4 is characterized by smaller values in S. maritima 

environment, showing thus a progressive diminution of the values of both colors from 

station 1 to station 4.

3.1.3. Mineral identification. 

With respect to the analysis of mineral composition, no significant differences in 

the sediments are found neither between types of environment or between stations (Fig 

3.9). All the samples had a similar mineral composition (Table 3.1). However, some 

samples have small amounts (&amp;lt;5%) of plagioclase, feldspars or siderite. Furthermore, it is 

important to note that the biggest difference in the mineral composition is in the 

percentages between quartz and clay minerals. The quartz percentage is higher in the 

station nearer to the main channel than the more remote station, the opposite occurs for 

clay minerals, their percentage increased from station 1 to station 4. With respect to the 

difference between biological communities, generally the mineralogical composition for Z. 

noltii is more variable and complex than for S. maritima.

 The existence of a difference in water content is observed between the two 

environments (S. maritima and Z. noltii) (ANOVA, p&lt;0.001), S. maritima presents an 

average off 11% ww more than Z. noltii. In both environments, there are differences 

between stations (ANOVA, p&lt;0.001), there is an increase in water content throughout 

stations. Furthermore, it is possible to note also stabilization in the stations more distant 

from the main channel. For each environment, the smallest percentage of water content is 

found in station 1, whereas the highest percentage is from station 4 in Z. noltii 

environment, showing thus a progressive increase from station 1 to station 4 (Fig.3.10). 

Figure 3.10:  Water content (% ww) in function of sampling station for each species. 

Regarding organic matter content, data show an average of 7.9 % dw, with a 

minimum and a maximum of 1.85 % dw and 11.92 % dw for stations 1 from Z. noltii 

(Zn1c) and 2 from S. maritima (Sp2a) respectively. 

When observing Figure 3.11, it is possible to observe differences (ANOVA, 

p&lt;0.001) in the content of organic matter between both environments. Hence, S. maritima 

environments present higher average of 9.87 % dw than for Z.noltii with an average of 5.93 

% dw of organic matter. In S. maritima, the percentage of organic matter does not have 

significant variations between stations, but it is important to note the existence of

differences between station 1 and the other ones. In Z. noltii environments, a progressive 

gradient is observed again with the percentage of organic matter increasing from station 1 

to station 4.

In relation to carbonate content, its average value is 2.54 % dw, with a minimum of

3.2.2. Determination of Elemental composition: OC, IC, ON, IN and C/N. 

The Elemental composition results are presented in Table 3.II in Annex 3. This 

composition varies between 0.29 and 3.23 % dw, with an average value of 1.75 % dw of 

OC (organic carbon), 0.03 and 3.23 % dw, with an average value of 0.20 % dw of ON 

(organic nitrogen), 0.01 and 1.11 % dw with an average value of 0.53 % dw of IC 

(inorganic carbon) and -0 and 0.13 % dw, with an average value of 0.05 % dw of IN 

(inorganic nitrogen).  

 The highest organic carbon content  is found in station 4 for Z. noltii environment 

(Zn4b), whereas the smallest percentage is from station 1 also in Z. noltii environment 

(Zn1b), showing thus a progressive increase of the organic carbon content from station 1 to 

station 4 as well as a higher variability in Z. noltii environments (Fig. 3.13). It is important 

to note that this same gradient is also observed in the result of the organic nitrogen content

(Fig. 3.15), where the maximum value is found in station 4 for S. maritima and the 

minimum value is found in station 1 for Z. noltii (Zn1b and Zn1c). It is possible to observe 

differences (ANOVA, p&lt;0.001) for both, organic carbon and organic nitrogen contents 

with respect to the different environments. The organic carbon content was almost double 

for S. maritima than Z. noltii, 2.25% dw and 1.24% dw, respectively. In the other hand, the 

organic nitrogen content was also double for S. maritima than Z. noltii, 0.27 % dw and 

0.14 % dw.

respectively. However, it is important to note significant differences between stations 

(ANOVA, p&lt;0.001); hence, it is possible to appreciate a progressive diminution from

4. Discussion 

4.1. Sediment characterization  

4.1.1. Sediment Analysis. 

Our results of sediment granulometry ranged between 3.3 – 23.6 % wv (wet 

volume) of clay in mineral samples (i.e. after organic matter removal), 1.6-15.8 % wv of 

silt and 86.8 -7.3 % wv of sand varying slightly with respect data previously described by 

Brotas et al., 1990 with a range 0.2 – 9.4 % of clay (? &amp;lt;2 µm), 2.4 – 76.6 % of silt (2 µm &amp;lt;

? &amp;lt;60 µm) and 97.3 – 14.0 % of sand (? &gt; 60 µm) for samples of Ria Formosa. The 

difference with the present study, namely coarser sediments in general, can be explained 

by the difference in the location of the sampling stations. In our study, stations have a 

progression from the main channel, with high currents, continuing along a secondary 

channel, with weaker currents, while in the other case the location of the sampling stations 

are randomly chosen. Values reported for other coastal systems with presence of both 

ecosystems (Mondego estuary, Portugal, Couto et al., 2013) are 50% of sand between 100 - 

50 microns (fine sand) in the case of S. maritima and 70% for Z. noltii. Silt and clay 

content values are only referred as being greater than 20%, in a similar manner as seen for 

our results where higher sand proportions were obtained in Z. noltii rather than in S. 

maritima. 

  Granulometry results show a progressive diminution from station 1 to station 4 

(Fig. 3.1) as well as a higher variability in Z. noltii environments in relation to S. maritima 

environments. This gradient can be explained by decreasing energy environment, i.e., as a 

decreasing of current speed (Fig. 4.1), as you move away from the main channel into the 

secondary channel, causing deposition of smaller particles (Zaimes and Emanuel, 1902). 

The mode grain size from station 1 to station 4 was  0.126, 0.105., 0.062 and 0.016mm, 

respectively, reflecting as the mean current velocity decreased from station 1 to station 4, 

in a range close of 10 cm. sec
-1

   to station 1 and 2, and around 1.0cm. sec
-1

to the station 3 

and 4  (Fig. 4.1). Hence, the smaller particles correspond with smaller settling-deposition 

velocity. Whit respect to the habitats, no differences in the mode grain size were found. 

The average values were 0.07 to S. maritima and 0.08 to Z. noltii.

current speed to stations 3 and 4; Green:  Approximation of current speed to stations 1and 2.      

  The existence of different gradient with respect to the grain size between the two 

environments may be due to the different position with respect to the sea level of both 

ecosystems. Z. noltii environments have a greater exposure to marine hydrodynamics than 

S. maritima, which is higher in the intertidal and therefore shows a smaller gradient. It is 

important to note that this difference in gradient for both environments was observed in 

most of the studied parameters studied (see for example Fig. 3.10, 3.11, 3.12). 

Color is one of the most useful parameter to characterize and distinguish the soil or 

sediment composition allowing to obtain much information about the materials that 

compose it. (Dominguez et al., 2011). The results obtained in the color analysis of the 

sediment of our study area, show differences for a *color (a * color With organic matter) 

between both environments (Fig. 3.6), with values below zero for the S. maritima, turning 

green, with an average of  -1.072  and values above zero in the Z. noltii, with an average of 

1.36, being more reddish. This red coloration may be due to the presence of minerals that 

act as coloring agents, such as oxides and hydroxides of Fe and Al or minerals with Iron 



  Discussion 

41 
 

(Dominguez et al., 2011). The possible presence of different forms of Fe either in crystals, 

such as, such as pyrite and siderite, or as free element can be the cause of this difference 

between the two environments and mostly associated with a reducing environment. Hence, 

Z. noltii could be more reductant environment than S. maritima. Furthermore differences 

were also found regarding a * color without organic matter (a *no.OM colors ) and b * 

color without organic matter (b * no.OM ) in S. maritima environment where a gradient 

was observed in both colors (Fig 3.7 and 3.8). Values decreased from station 1 to station 4, 

becoming less reddish and yellow, which can be interpreted with the decrease of various 

forms of Fe (reddish) and hydrated goethite (yellow-brownish) (Dominguez et al., 2011). 

With respect to the different habitat, both colors showed bigger values in Z. noltii than S. 

maritima. Respect to L*color, with and without organic matter in samples, showing no 

significant differences between environments, so there are no significant changes in these 

color components. This means that the reflectance of the samples was similar for all of 

them, probably reflecting the same origin of the organic matter and of the mineral particles 

in all the samples.   

With respect to mineral composition, no differences in sediments sample are found 

neither between types of environment or between stations. However, some samples had 

small amounts (&amp;lt;5%) of plagioclase, feldspars or siderite. Furthermore, the main 

difference in the mineral composition was found in the percentages of quartz and clay 

minerals (phyllosilicates) (Table 3.9). The clay mineral proportions for the most remote 

station from the main channel were coincident with the grain size.  Hence, the major 

accumulation of organic matter in these stations could be explained based on the 

morphologic and chemical characteristic of clay mineral. This could be due to the strongly 

absorption of organic matter by clay minerals. This interaction between the clay and some 

kinds of compounds can create relatively stable aggregates, and consequently, the moisture 

and aeration properties of the sediment are influenced. In addition, for this interaction 

result a protective effect of the organic compound from biological degradation. Due to this 

effect of protection for degradation, the organic matter of the sediments is normally 

positively correlated with the clay mineral content (Norman, 1964), with smaller grain 

size, as well as, the effect of hydrodynamics Whereas the differences in the proportions of 

quartz between stations, could be explained with a relation with the granulometry.  Some 



  Discussion 

42 
 

authors reported that the quartz has a positive correlation with  the percentage of sand (AE 

de Limnoligía, 1984). The proportions of quartz could increase with the sand content due 

to the fact that sands are mostly composed by quartz, hence in the stations exposed to 

higher energy, which are associated with the deposition of sand, (Macreadie et al., 2012). 

At the same time the presence of pyrite and siderite, may be associated to the existence of 

reduction conditions (Lemos et al., 2007), which would allow for the permanence of the 

organic material for a longer period of time in the sediment. 

 

4.1.2. Geochemical Analysis. 

The average values of the water content was 46.12 ± 11.30 % ww (wet weight), 

with S. maritima environment having close 11% more water than Z. noltii, with values of 

51.6 and 40.6 % ww, respectively ours values are quite similar to the analysis performed in 

the Ria Formosa, Ramalhete, by Friend and co-authors (2003), where the values obtained 

were approximately 30 ± 16 % wv and 32 ± 18 % wv for their two campaigns, 

respectively. No significant differences in the water content, for either transects or habitats, 

were detected between the two campaigns. Furthermore, for both campaigns the highest 

mean water contents occurred within S. maritima ecosystems, which a mean value of 48 % 

wv. The water content of the sediment is directly related to grain size and is a consequence 

of the density of the sediment (Fig. 2.I and Fig. 2.II in the Annex 2). According to 

Halmilton (1974) there are empirical relation between mean grain size and density and also 

between grain size and the porosity (Syvitski, 2007). An increase of the water content was 

observed as the proportion of fine grain size decreases and the consequent decrease in 

density (Fig. 3.I in the Annex 3). This result shows in turn that the choice of the stations 

location was pertinent for increasing confinement and thus reducing hydrodynamics along 

the stations profile. 

Regarding the organic matter content, values were between1.86 and –11.92% dw, 

which are in accordance with the study of Cabaço and co-authors (2010), where it showed 

values with an average of 2 % dw.  It is important to note that percentage of organic matter 

was, approximately a 40%, higher in S. maritima than Z. noltii. This difference could be 

due to the variation in the hydrodynamic levels to which the biology communities are 



  Discussion 

43 
 

exposed. S. maritima environment is less influenced by the hydrodynamics, so it could be 

possible that more organic matter deposition occur than in Z. noltii environment. At the 

same time, an increasing gradient was observed in the organic matter content from the first 

stations, close to the main channel, to last stations the most remote (Fig. 3.11), gradient 

that is in agreement with the grainsize variation. According to other studies, (Fabiano y 

Danovaro, 1994) the accumulation of organic matter in small grain sizes is favored because 

dissolved oxygen penetration is smaller and there is thus no oxidation of the organic 

matter.  Therefore in sandy sediments which have a larger grain size than the silt and clay, 

penetration of oxygen is facilitated, leading to higher rate of organic matter oxidation. In 

addition the sediments formed by silt or clay may favor the formation of hypoxic or anoxic 

bottom layers due to lack of dissolved oxygen. 

Seagrass and saltmarsh are biological communities that support a lot of calcified 

organisms due to the accumulation of particulate inorganic carbon by the presence of 

epiphytic and benthic invertebrates. Sedimentation and deposition of carbonates is 

associated with particle sedimentation and photosynthetic capacity of these ecosystems, 

which provides an optimal pH environment for deposition (Mazarrasa et al., 2015). 

Carbonate content values in this study were in the range 3 - 14% dw (mean of 2.54 ± 0.77), 

similar to values reported for Ria Formosa with contents &amp;lt;5% (Andarde et al., 2004). The 

carbonate content obtained in ours samples showed significant differences in Station 4 for 

Z. noltii with respect to other stations in both environments (Fig. 3.12). By linking the 

carbonate content with the grain size, it is possible to observe that increased carbonate 

content is proportional to the finer sediment (Fig. 2.III in the Annex 2), which could be 

explained by the possible presence of foraminifera. Several studies such as Mechler and 

Grady (1984) have reported fine sediment preference of certain foraminifera such as 

A.beccarii var. Sobrina and A. beccarii var.tepida. 

The organic nitrogen content of the sediment of S. maritima and Z. noltii 

communities has an average value of 0.20 ± 0.10% dw, being similar to the reported value 

by Peralta et al. ( 2000)  in the Ria Formosa,  of 0.16 ± 0.01% dw in the central channel 

and 0.26 ± 0.04% dw in high intertidal zone. This lower sediment nitrogen content could 

result in a higher rhizome elongation, and consequent greater root development, with the 



  Discussion 

44 
 

objective to increase nutrient uptake from the sediment (Peralta et al., 2000). It is important 

to note that S. maritima environment contained approximately the double of organic 

nitrogen than Z. noltii. This can be due to greater degradation in the Z. noltii sediment or 

also to greater removal caused by the greater hydrodynamics, at which it is exposed.  

On the other hand, organic carbon contents in our study were slightly lower, with 

values of 1.75 ± 0.85 % dw compared. to  2.0 ± 0.5% dw and 2.9 ± 0.4%, dw in Peralta et 

al. (2000). Also our values of organic carbon were in the range of, or even similar, to 

values for  other coastal systems as the ones reported by Couto et al. ( 2013) with both 

environments such as Mondego estuary, Portugal, with 2.2 ± 0.2 % dw. In our study, the 

fact that S. maritima environment contained approximately twice more organic carbon than 

Z. noltii, could be explained due to a higher carbon oxidation or degradation in sediments, 

as well as a greater remove or less deposition in Z. noltii environment due to higher local 

hydrodynamics (action of currents and sediment washing). 

In addition, our data showed a progressive increase of organic content, carbon and 

nitrogen, from station 1 to station 4 as well as a higher variability in Z. noltii environments 

(Fig. 3.13). This gradient could be explained by the presence of an inverse relationship 

between the size of the sediment particles and organic matter content (Fig. 2.IV and Fig. 

2.V in the Annex 2). The deposition of OM (and all particles) increases with decreasing 

hydrodynamics. Then the OM may better stabilized in sediments because they get attached 

to the fine sediment fractions. Hence, the material with higher silt-clay fractions has higher 

concentrations of organic compounds (Silva et al., 1998). Furthermore, according to 

Duinker, (1980), the silt-clay particles can better be covered with a layer of organic 

material, because these tend to have negative charges associated with their structure. As 

eventually this component of the sediment sink to the ocean floor, remove a significant 

amount of organic material from seawater. This author also indicates that sands are always 

composed by quartz, which have no charge, hence not attracting organic matter and are 

therefore associated with lower amounts of organic material. Moreover, environments 

associated with the deposition of sand are higher energy environments, so the currents 

produced mixed sand and carbon oxidation occur, resulting in lower amounts of this latter 

component (Macreadie et al., 2012).  



  Discussion 

45 
 

In relation to inorganic content, for inorganic carbon values no marked differences 

between environments or between stations, with the exception of station 4 in Z. noltii, 

which presents the lowest values (Fig. 3.18) and cannot be relate with the high values of 

carbonates associate with the finest sediments explained above. Brambai and co- authors 

(1991) indicated that the presence of inorganic carbon also might be due to the presence of 

calcite, in particular Mg-calcite, which would be of biogenic origin. With respect to 

inorganic nitrogen values were slightly higher in S. maritima environment than in Z. noltii 

environment (Fig. 3.17). This difference in the content of inorganic nitrogen may be due to 

increased presence of bacteria in the sediment, responsible for the remineralization of 

organic nitrogen to form their inorganic form. 

In the other hand, C/N  organic ratio results ranged from 7.8 to 10.3 with an average 

of 8.8 with no significant differences between biological communities with similar values 

as 8.58 to S. maritima and 8.99 to Z. noltii, whereas important differences were observed 

between stations. Indeed, there is a progressive diminution C/N from station 1 to station 4 

in both environments (Fig. 3.19). This gradient could be due to differences in the 

hydrodynamics at each station or a progressive difference in the origin of the organic 

matter. The trend observed could indicate that the sediments for the more exposed stations 

to hydrodynamics, could suffer greater degradation of nitrogen, hence, a greater C/N ratio 

was observed. Conversely, the stations that are less exposed to hydrodynamics could suffer 

less nitrogen degradation and therefore would have less C/N ratio. Similar results with 

respect to values reported for Peralta et al. (2009), in Ria Formosa, were 14.2 ± 1.3 for the 

main channel and 12.7 ± 2.6 for a higher intertidal channel. Higher ratios of 6.63 would be 

possible to explain as the presence of variables amounts of organic nitrogen poorest into 

terrigenous or edaphic material. When the C/N ratio exceeds 10, it may be because there is 

an increase in mineralization, causing a decrease of organic nitrogen. This means that the N 

component of OM during decomposition decreases much faster than the C component 

(Silva and Ortíz., 2002) , thus the C:N tends to be lower in the sediment than in live plants.

4.2. Carbon sequestration rate 

The carbon accumulation rate was calculated using unpublished data of 

sedimentary rates of 0.5 cm.year
-1 

for S. maritima environment and 0.9 cm year
-1

 for Z. 

noltii (Veiga-Pires and Santos, personal communication).The carbon accumulation 

estimates for ours samples ranged from 37.30 to 182.0 g OC.m
-2

.year

, with an average of 

120.0 ± 37.30
 
g OC.m

.year

. More specifically, the carbon accumulation rate for S. 

maritima environment was twice as high as those for Z. noltii environment, with values of 

131.8 g OC.m
-2

.year
-1

and 83.9 g OC.m

.year

respectively. In addition, it is possible to 

appreciate a progressive increase from station 1 to station 4 in both environments as well 

as a higher variability in Z. noltii (Fig 4.2).   

Figure 4.2: Carbon accumulation rate (g. m

) in function of sampling station for each 

species.  

This difference could be due to the difference between the sediment rates for both 

environments, as well as the difference in sediment density, because the carbon 

accumulation rate is highly dependent of the sediment rate and organic volumetric content 

(Lavery et al., 2013).  



  Discussion 

47 
 

Due to the lack of published data regarding rates of carbon accumulation in the Ria 

Formosa, our results were compared to values described by Duarte et al. (2005), which it 

searched the published literature for estimates of carbon burial in vegetated ecosystems  to 

obtain estimates of average carbon burial of these habitats. Ours values were in the range 

of, or even similar, to values of this publication, where the estimates of carbon 

accumulation rate were 139.0, 151.0 and 83.0 g C m
?2

 yr
?1

 to mangroves, salt marsh and 

seagrass, respectively. Hence, these results agreed with our data because the mangroves and 

salt marsh were identified as important environment for carbon burial, with rates twice 

bigger than seagrass meadows.

5. Conclusions 

In order to reach the main objective of this study, the questions raised in the 

beginning were answered 

- Is there a difference in C sequestration between S. maritima and Z .noltii 

habitats? 

 Yes, significant differences were found between both ecosystems. S.maritima environment 

showed nearly twice the organic carbon content than Z. noltii environments. Which is 

reflected in theirs accumulation rate the same form, because the salt marsh were identified 

as important environment for carbon burial, with rates twice bigger than seagrass meadows.  

- What is the relation between OC content and the sediment granulometry? 

It was observed an inverse relationship between the size of the sediment particles 

and organic carbon content. Hence, gramulometry results show a progressive grainsize 

diminution from station 1 to station 4, so inversely a progressive increase of the organic 

carbon content was observed along stations. 

- What is the relation between OC content and the sediment color? 

The possible presence of different forms of Fe either in crystals, such as pyrite and 

siderite, or as free element can be cause of the difference in the organic carbon contents 

between the two environments and mostly associated with a reducing environment. 

Furthermore, the reflectance of the samples was similar for all of them, probably reflecting 

the same origin of the organic matter and of the mineral particles in all the samples. 

- What is the relation between the ON and the OC? 

It was observed a bigger correlation between ON and OC, both organic contents 

show the same performance. S. maritima environment showed approximately twice more 

organic carbon and nitrogen contents than Z. noltii. Also, our data showed a progressive 

increase of organic content from station 1 to station 4 as well as a higher in Z. noltii 

environment. Which could be explained by the existence of an inverse association between 

the size of the sediment particles and organic contents or by the differences in the level of 

energy, which are exposed. 



   

  Conclusions 

49 
 

- Is there a relationship between the concentrations of pigments and C sink?  

With respect to the concentration of pigment, we fail to answer this question due to 

the possible degradation of the pigments. This result were considered not representative 

therefore not be taken into account in this work.
