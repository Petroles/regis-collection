Presentation 

 

The construction of dams modifies rivers into a complex of ecological systems. 

These new environments are exposed to multiple uses and integrated to a complex 

generation system which can, while providing a relatively clean and renewable energy 

source, cause major socio-environmental changes and interfere with the ecological 

structure and functioning of river basins (Tundisi et al., 1993; Tundisi and Matsumura-

Tundisi, 2003; Nogueira et al., 2006; Agostinho et al., 2007; Nogueira et al, 2012). 

The Paranapanema River is one of the main tributaries of the Paraná River (La 

Plata basin), located between the coordinates 22° - 26° S and 47° - 54° W, on the 

tropical/subtropical boundary (Southeast/South Brazil). The river is under Federal 

jurisdiction because is the natural border between the States of Paraná and São Paulo, 

with a length of 929 km. The river is known for its “good water quality” and for 

presenting eleven hydropower plants, which have been constructed along the main 

course of the river. 

In 2011, a systematic Physical, Chemical and Biotic (Phytoplankton and 

Thermotolerant coliforms)
1
 Monitoring Program started in eight cascade reservoirs of 

the Paranapanema River reservoir cascade system (Jurumirim, Chavantes, Salto 

Grande, Canoas II, Canoas I, Capivara, Taquaruçu and Rosana). This initiative resulted 

from a partnership between the company in charge of the hydropower generation and 

researchers of the São Paulo State University (UNESP), Campus of Botucatu. At that 

time, I participated in this program as a research trainee supported by a scholarship 

from FUNDIBIO (Fundação do Instituto de Biociências – UNESP Botucatu). 

Aiming to deep explore the monitoring results and use the academic knowledge 

on the complexity of these ecosystems in order to improve the technical protocols of 

the Monitoring Program, in 2013 we proposed the development of this PhD Thesis 

entitled: 

"Evaluation to the use of water quality indexes and bioindicators - zooplankton 

and phytoplankton, in a monitoring program of Paranapanema River Reservoirs 

Cascata (SP / PR - Brazil)" (“Avaliação do uso de índices de qualidade de água e

 Zooplankton was additionally sampled - it was not part of the monitoring protocols. 



bioindicadores – zooplâncton e fitoplâncton, em um programa de monitoramento 

dos Reservatórios em Cascata no rio Paranapanema (SP/PR – Brasil)” (in Portuguese). 

The Thesis was partitioned into four distinct, but complementary, Chapters. Since 

the themes are reasonably connected, some repetitions are inevitable. 

The title of Chapter 1 is “Identifying limnological patterns in a large subtropical 

reservoir cascade – Paranapanema River, Brazil”. The objective is to discriminate the 

main limnological tendencies and recurrent patters along the Paranapanema River 

cascade. Analyses based on the reservoirs morphometric characteristics, operation 

type, water retention type, physical, chemical and biological variables and trophic 

status. In this chapter were considered eight reservoirs, Jurumirim (JR), Chavantes 

(CH), Salto Grande (SG), Canoas II (CII), Canoas I (CI), Capivara (CP), Taquaruçu (TQ) e 

Rosana (RS), arranged in a cascade system with a total of 37 sampling sites and two 

sampling seasons (wet and dry). We analyze water transparency, depth, temperature, 

pH, condutivity, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, total solids, suspended 

solids, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, chlorophyll a and thermotolerant coliforms as 

limnológicas variables and also some ecologically important morphometric 

characteristics. 

The Chapter 2 is entitled “Application of multiple-uses indices to assess water 

quality emphasizing the zooplankton community and focus on biomonitoring and 

management purposes”. Here we indeed to apply and compare the results of different 

types of water quality indices for multipurpose uses, such as water supply, trophy 

levels evaluation and protection of aquatic communities. The selected indexes were 

Water Quality Index (WQI), Trophic State Index (Carlson, 1977 and some derived 

modified models), Phytoplankton Community Index (FCI), Zooplankton Community 

Index (ZCI) and the Planktonic Index of Biotic Integrity (P-IBI) - a new tool that has been 

recently developed. The objective is to generated new insights on this theme in order 

to improve the present water quality monitoring program at a regional scale - a 

relatively large watershed from Southeast Brazil. 

The Chapter 3 is entitled “Zooplankton community composition and structure 

as potential indicators of water quality and trophic state conditions in the 

Paranapanema River reservoir cascade”. The main goal of this study is to explore 

information on the structure of the zooplankton sampled in the Paranapanema River 



reservoir cascade (eight reservoirs), focusing on the potential of this community to 

evaluate changes in water quality and trophic level - biomonitoring purposes. 

Information on the structure and functioning of planktonic communities in reservoir 

ecosystems provide opportunities to investigate patterns of responses to cyclical 

variations and episodic disturbances and can be useful to evaluate the resilience in this 

kind of system to limnological changes in relatively short periods.  

Finally, the Chapter 4 is entitled “A new tool to assess ecosystem health in 

large subtropical reservoirs: development and validation of a Planktonic Index of 

Biotic Integrity (P-IBI)”. We developed and validated a Planktonic Index of Biotic 

Integrity (P-IBI) following Kane et al. (2009) with the purpose of effectively assess the 

ecosystem health of subtropical reservoirs. The study is based on a reservoir cascade 

system located in Southern Brazil and includes metrics of the plankton community – 

phyto and zooplankton. In contrast to traditional water quality approaches, the P-IBI is 

an aggregative indicator that can not only capture aquatic trophic status but also 

identify variations in the aquatic ecosystems associated to the biota. The development 

and application of a viable Planktonic Index of Biotic Integrity (P-IBI) for subtropical 

reservoirs can be useful for management purposes – stakeholder’s decision processes, 

improvement of monitoring protocols, and expansion of scientific knowledge. 

We hope this thesis can bring new insights to the research line on Ecology of 

Reservoirs and that some ideas and obtained results may support better management 

resolutions too.

Abstract 

The present study aims to identify limnological patterns in the Paranapanema River 

cascade as a system based on the morphometric characteristics, operation type, water 

retention time, physical, chemical and biological variables and trophic status on behalf 

of management purposes. The Paranapanema River is one of the main tributaries of 

the high Paraná River (La Plata basin) and is the natural border between the States of 

Paraná and São Paulo, Southern Brazil. The study was carried out in eight reservoirs, 

Jurumirim (JR), Chavantes (CH), Salto Grande (SG), Canoas II (CII), Canoas I (CI), 

Capivara (CP), Taquaruçu (TQ) e Rosana (RS), arranged in a cascade system. A total of 

37 sites were sampled in two seasons (dry and wet). We analyzed the following 

limnological and water quality variables: water transparency, depth, temperature, pH, 

conductivity, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, total solids, suspended 

solids, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, chlorophyll a and thermotolerant coliforms. 

Additionally, it was calculated the trophic state index for tropical/subtropical 

reservoirs, the water retention time and some important morphometric characteristics 

of each reservoir. Data analyzes focused on spatial (longitudinal and vertical 

dimensions) and seasonal (late summer-wet and late spring-dry periods) variation. The 

reservoir operational design (storage or run-of-river) is a major factor influencing on 

limnological structure and functioning. It was concluded that the influence of the land 

use intensification in the Paranapanema River middle stretches is also determinant and 

comparable to the influence of the river damming.

Resumo 

O presente estudo tem como objetivo identificar padrões limnológicos na cascata de 

reservatórios do rio Paranapanema como um sistema, baseado nas características 

morfométricas, tipo de operação, tempo de retenção de água, variáveis físicas, 

químicas e biológicas, além do estado trófico, para fins de manejo. O rio 

Paranapanema é um dos principais afluentes do Alto Rio Paraná (Bacia do Prata) e é a 

fronteira natural entre os Estados do Paraná e São Paulo, no sul do Brasil. O estudo foi 

realizado em oito reservatórios, Jurumirim (JR), Chavantes (CH), Salto Grande (SG), 

Canoas II (CII), Canoas I (CI), Capivara (CP), Taquaruçu (TQ) e Rosana (RS), dispostos em 

cascata. Foram amostrados um total de 37 estações em dois períodos (seca e chuva). 

As seguintes variáveis limnológicas e de qualidade da água foram analisadas: 

transparência da água, profundidade, temperatura, pH, condutividade, oxigênio 

dissolvido, demanda bioquímica de oxigênio, sólidos totais, sólidos suspensos, 

nitrogênio total, fósforo total, clorofila a e coliformes termotolerantes. Além disso, foi 

calculado o índice de estado trófico para reservatórios tropicais/subtropicais, o tempo 

de retenção de água e algumas características morfométricas importantes de cada 

reservatório. As análises dos dados focaram variações espaciais (dimensões 

longitudinal e vertical) e sazonais (verão tardio - úmido e final da primavera). O tipo de 

operação do reservatório (acumulação ou fio d´água) é um fator importante que 

influencia a estrutura limnológica e o funcionamento dos mesmos. Podemos concluir 

que a influência da intensificação do uso da terra nos trechos médios do rio 

Paranapanema é determinante e comparável à influência do represamento do rio. 

Key words: Limnological patterns, reservoir cascade system, trophic state, spatial 

variability, temporal variability. 

Introduction 

In Brazil, a major modification produced on rivers is the construction of dams, 

which substantially alter the flow condition, the storage capacity and all chemical and 

biological process associated to these important physical characteristics. For the South 

American continent, there is an estimative of about 1,000 installed reservoirs 

(Agostinho et al., 2007).

Most large reservoirs in the country are primarily projected for production of 

electricity. Brazil's water potential is one of the largest in the world, where 

hydropower plants have produced about 90% of the energy consumed in recent years 

(ca. 70,000MW). Presently there are at least 190 large hydropower plants (individual 

production higher than 30 MW) and 420 small ones (individual production lower than 

30 MW) (www.aneeel.gov.br). Additionally, a number of 1,000 different sites have 

been inventoried for new projects (potential 107,000 MW) (Kelman et al., 2006). 

For the first decades of this new century, it is expected the construction of the 

3,700 dams worldwide, what could increase the global hydropower production by 73 

%. This would correspond to intensification in the exploitation of the technically 

feasible hydropower potential from 22 % to 39% (International Commission on Large 

Dams, 2011). However, the role of hydropower in total global electricity production 

will rise only slightly from 16 % in 2011 to 18 % until 2040 because of the concurrent 

increase in global energy demand (Zarfl et al., 2015). 

Hydroelectric dams are an integrated and complex generation system that 

provide a relatively clean and renewable energy type. However, they can cause major 

socio-environmental changes and interfere with the ecological structure and 

functioning of river basins (Tundisi et al., 1993; Tundisi and Matsumura-Tundisi, 2003; 

Nogueira et al., 2006; Agostinho et al., 2007). 

The construction of dams in the rivers transforms lotic stretches into lentic or 

semi-lentic systems, promoting significant attenuations in current velocity and 

increase in depth. The reservoirs, especially those of large size, are generally systems 

of great spatial and temporal complexity (Thornton, 1990; Straskraba et al., 1993; 

Tundisi et al., 1993; Nogueira et al., 1999). 

In terms of the operational design and engineering concept, reservoirs can be 

classified as accumulation (storage) or run-of-river systems (Kelman et al., 1999). The 

accumulation systems are larger in size and volume, with high water retention time. 

The distinctiveness between accumulation and run-of-river systems, in terms of 

physical dimensions and functioning, affects the physical and chemical limnology of 

these environments as well as the aquatic communities organization (Nogueira et al., 

2008; Perbiche-Neves and Nogueira, 2010; Tundisi and Matsumura-Tundisi, 2003; 

Nogueira et al. 2012; Perbiche-Neves and Nogueira, 2013).

The accumulated limnological knowledge on reservoirs limnology promoted a 

growing understanding of these environments as an exclusive class of lakes (e.g. 

Tundisi, 1988, Thornton, 1990; Straškraba, et al., 1993; Henry, 1999, Tundisi and 

Straškraba, 1999). Despite of the structural and functional similarity between lakes and 

large reservoirs some particularities have been pointed out. For instance, Lind et aI. 

(1993) discussed the differences between lakes and reservoirs related to the 

application of trophic state indexes. According to the authors, one of the main factor 

that affect the application of these indices is the conspicuous spatial heterogeneity 

that occurs in reservoirs. 

Classical studies on reservoirs, including Thornton (1990) and Wetzel (2001), 

distinguish three areas in a reservoir: the region with strong influence of the incoming 

river - lotic region; an intermediate - transition region and finally a region considered 

similar to a lake, located near the dam. However, it is now known that in large tropical 

reservoirs, this zonation is multidimensional, greatly influenced by the input of 

secondary tributaries and also by the differential residence time of each reservoir arm 

(Nogueira et al., 1999, Nogueira, 2000; 2001; Pinto-Coelho et al., 2006). These 

distinctive areas in reservoir ecosystem may also change seasonally, in a complex 

dynamics (Thornton et al., 1990; Henry and Maricatto, 1996; Nogueira et al., 1999; 

Pagioro and Thomaz, 2002). 

The large-scale variability of reservoirs along the main axis is determined by 

longitudinal gradients of flow velocity, depth, width, particle sedimentation, 

transparency and light penetration, and thermal stratification (Armengol et al. 1999; 

Henry and Maricatto, 1996; Paggioro and Thomaz, 2002). In comparison with lakes, 

reservoirs exhibit high watersheds area/water body area, shorter but varying 

retentions times, a rapid ageing process related to watershed uses, high capability to 

retain organic and inorganic matter (Straskraba, 1998; Straskraba and Tundisi, 1999). 

The limnological conditions and the water quality of the rivers, lakes and 

reservoirs are greatly influenced by the drainage network, due to the biogeophysical 

characteristics of the basin, land uses and the state of conservation of the ecosystems. 

Thus, differences in the concentration of total dissolved solids or particulates in water, 

for example, reflect variations of geological nature, soil use and occupation, and 

precipitation/evaporation rate. The characteristics of riparian vegetation along 



5 
 

watercourses, in turn, may be responsible for differences in water temperature and in 

the quantity and size distribution of the organic particles transported (Rice et al., 2001; 

Jorcin and Nogueira, 2005). 

However, there are still many gaps in the understanding of these ecosystems. In 

case of cascaded reservoirs, efforts have been undertaken to determine how their 

operation affects the ecological structure and organization of rivers or how cumulative 

effects spread throughout the system (Barbosa et al., 1999; Matsumura-Tundisi and 

Tundisi, 2003; Nogueira et al., 2006; 2008; Jorcin and Nogueira, 2008; Naliato et al., 

2009; Nogueira et al., 2012; Perbiche-Neves and Nogueira, 2013). In Brazil, new 

cascades of reservoirs have been built or planned, including rivers under international 

jurisdiction, such as Paraná and Uruguay. 

An integrated approach, including measurements and experimentation, is 

required for the understanding of the problems and working mechanisms of reservoir 

ecosystems, giving their inherent complexity, with many components and subsystems 

that interact intensively in space and time (Tundisi, 2008). 

The Paranapanema River is one of the main tributaries of the Paraná River (La 

Plata basin), located between the coordinates 22° - 26° S and 47° - 54° W, on the 

tropical/subtropical boundary (Southeast/South Brazil). The river, with a length of 929 

km, is under Federal jurisdiction, because it is the natural border between the states of 

Paraná and São Paulo. According to the CEEIPEMA (Executive Committee for 

Integrated Studies of the Paranapanema River Basin) in 1980 the Paranapanema River 

was classified as Class 1 (CONAMA Resolution 357/2005) from the headwaters to the 

confluence of the Turvo River and as Class 2 from the confluence of the Turvo River to 

its mouth on the Paraná River. These classifications intended "to preserve the natural 

balance of aquatic communities". 

Aiming to provide technical-scientific information on behalf of management 

purposes, the present study intended to identify limnological tendencies or patterns of 

variation in the Paranapanema River reservoir cascade. We considered the 

morphometric characteristics, operation type, water retention time, physical, chemical 

and biological variables and the trophic status. We hypothesized that: 1) the 

Paranapanema River reservoir cascaded is highly influenced by the intensification of 



6 
 

the agriculture land use towards the middle basin; 2) The reservoir operation is 

determinant in establishing reservoirs limnological patterns. 

Study area 

The Paranapanema River is the natural border between the states of Paraná 

and São Paulo, with a length of 929 km. Since the 1950’s, eleven hydropower plants 

were constructed in the main course of the river. Ongoing studies have being carried 

out in eight of the reservoirs by researchers of the São Paulo State University, Campus 

of Botucatu, as part of a Limnological and Water Quality monitoring program of the 

Paranapanema River reservoir cascade. Three of the reservoirs, Jurumirim, Chavantes 

and Capivara are storage systems (i.e. with high water retention times), whereas the 

others, Salto Grande, Canoas II, Canoas I, Taquaruçu and Rosana are run-of-the-river 

systems. 

The selected reservoirs for study purposes are Jurumirim (JR), Chavantes (CH), 

Salto Grande (SG), Canoas II (CII), Canoas I (CI), Capivara (CP), Taquaruçu (TQ) and 

Rosana (RS), arranged in a cascade (upstream ? downstream) system. Information 

were obtained at 37 sampling sites (Fig. 1), whose distribution intended to cover the 

longitudinal gradient between the lotic (Paranapanema River entrance) and lentic 

(dam) areas of each reservoir, as well as the entrance of important secondary 

tributaries. At least three up to six sites in each reservoir were selected. Table 1 

presents the geographic coordinates as well as the altitude data of the sampling sites, 

obtained with a Garmin Etrex Vista H GPS.

Material and methods 

Sampling campaigns for physical, chemical and biological measurements were 

carried out in the eight reservoirs JR, CH, SG, CII, CI, CP, TQ and RS (Fig. 1) in two 

periods of the year March (late summer-wet season) and October (late spring-dry 

season) of 2011. 

The limnological variables measured in situ and respective methodologies are 

shown in Table 2.

Water samples were collected with a Van Dorn bottle in three depths 

corresponding to the surface, middle and bottom (about 0,5 to 1,0 m above 

sediments) of the water column for nutrient analysis (total nitrogen and phosphorus), 

total solids, suspended solids, turbidity, chlorophyll a, biochemical oxygen and thermo 

tolerant coliforms. For this last variable 100 mL of sample was collected with sterilized 

gloves to avoid contamination and formerly wrapped in a sterile plastic envelope. 

Samples for total nitrogen and total phosphorus were previously digested 

(Valderrama, 1981) and then determined spectrophotometrically (Strickland and 

Parsons, 1960). Turbidity was measured in a turbidimeter Tecnopon MS and total 

solids were analyzed according to the amount of remaining residues in a beaker after 

total evaporation of a sample and subsequent oven drying at a set temperature (100 ° 

C) (APHA, 2005). 

The determination of suspended solids followed the gravimetric method 

according to the principle described in Cole (1979). Millipore AP40 membranes and 

vacuum filtration pump were used for the retention of particulate material in 



10 
 

suspension in a known volume of water (500 to 1000 ml). The filters were pre-dried 

(450 °C for 1h) and weighed on the Denver Instrument analytical balance (0.00001g 

precision). After filtration in the field, the filters were again dried and weighed to 

obtain the total suspended material (50 °C / 24h). Subsequently, the same filters were 

taken to an oven type Mufla (Fanen brand model 413) at 450 °C for 1 hour to 

discriminate the organic and inorganic fractions. 

The biochemical oxygen demand was determined by the Incubation Method 

(20 °C, 5 days) (APHA, 1998) and thermo tolerant coliforms quantitative determination 

was performed according to the NMP technique, recommended by APHA (2005). 

Total chlorophyll a concentration was determined after vacuum filtration 

(Millipore AP40 membranes) of 0.5 to 1 L of water from each sampling depth, 

depending on the concentration of particulate material on the water sample. For 

pigments extraction, cold acetone (90%) and manual maceration were used (Talling 

and Driver, 1963; Golterman et al., 1978). 

The shore line development index was calculated according methodology 

proposed by Häkanson (2005) and using data collected from Duke Energy International 

Paranapanema Generation (ABC da Energia). The theoretical residence time (days) was 

defined as the ratio of reservoir volume and the flow calculated using the formula: TRT 

= V / (Q x 86,400), where V = reservoir volume (m³); Q = mean flow (m³ s
-1

) and 86,400 

= number of seconds contained in a day. Input data are available at the government 

agency website (http://sar.ana.gov.br). 

The trophic state index was determined in accordance with Cunha et al. (2013) 

for tropical/subtropical reservoirs (TSItsr), which include six categories: (U) 

Ultraoligotrophic (?51.1), (O) Oligotrophic (51.2 -53.1), (M) Mesotrophic (53.2-55.7), 

(E) Eutrophic (55.8-58.1), (S) Supereutrophic (58.2-59) and (H) Hypereutrophic (? 59.1), 

respectively. 

The studied parameters were compared with the references standards 

established by CONAMA Resolution 357/2005 (conditions of water quality categories 

for Brazilian aquatic systems) for Class 1 waters – the better condition in which the 

Paranapanema River is framed of. See Table 3.

the PRIMER v6 statistics package for Windows (Plymouth Routines in Multivariate 

Ecological Research, www.primer-e.com). 

Results 

The studied reservoirs have distinct features in terms of morphometric 

dimensions, operation and trophy degrees, for instance, which are very important for 

the limnological structure and functioning. Table 4 systematize the reservoirs main

Jurumirim reservoir 

Jurumirim reservoir is a 449 km
2
 storage system, very dendritic (17.1 shore line 

development index) and with a large water retention time, about 400 days (Table 4). 

The depths measured in Jurumirim reservoir varied between 5.1 m (JR1) and 32 m 

(JRDam) in the wet season and between 4.7 m (JR1) and 29 m (JRDam) in the dry 

season. 

A variation of about 2 m in the reservoir water level was observed along the 

studied year. The lowest value occurred in January (monthly average of 565.1 m) and 

the highest in April (monthly average of 567.2 m) and the highest outflow occurred in 

February, mean of 342 m

) (Fig. 2.) 

During the wet season lower values of water transparency were observed at 

station JR1 and JRUp (0.65 m) and higher at JR4 (2.3 m) and JRDam (3 m). In the dry 

season lowest values occurred at the sites JR1 (0.4 m), JRUp (0.5) and JR2 (0.6) and 

higher at JR4 (3.45 m) and JRDam (3.5 m) (Fig. 2). A clear longitudinal gradient increase 

(upstream to dam), was observed both in wet (4.6 X) and dry (8.7 X) seasons.

and water transparency at the Jurumirim reservoir sampling sites in the 2011 wet and 
dry seasons. 
 

Temperature profiles along the water column are shown in Figure 3. In the wet 

season different conditions were found along the reservoir. In the central region of the 

reservoir – station JR3, the temperature profile was practically isothermal while at JR1 

and JR4 sites decreasing gradients were observed. Slightly stratification occurred at 

dam (JRDam) and upstream (JRUp) areas and more structured stratification occurred 

at JR2. Higher values of temperature were observed at the surface, varying between 

25 and 26.5 
o
C, and the lower at the bottom, between 23 and 24 

o
C. The amplitude of 

variation between surface and bottom was higher at stations JR2 and JRUp, 

approximately 3 
o
C. 

The dry season was characterized by superficial stratifications – at JR1, JRUp 

and JR2, and isothermal condition at JRDam and JR4. At JR4 there was a decrease in 

the temperature near to the bottom, bellow 21 m, and a small surface decrease was 

observed at JRDam.

 at JRUp. In summer it was observed a considerable diminution of oxygen 

in the deepest layer of the water column at the dam zone (&lt;5mg l
-1

). At others sampled 

sites, moderate decreases, around 2 mg l
-1

, occurred with increasing depth (JR4 and 

JR2) or values remained practically homogeneous (JR3, JR1 and JRUp). During the dry 

period, there was a small oxygen increase at the surface region of stations JR1, JRUp 

and JR2 and a bottom decrease at station JR4.

Chavantes reservoir 

Chavantes reservoir is a 400 km
2
 storage system, very dendritic (15.3 shore line 

development index) and with about 335 days of water retention time (Table 4). The 

depths measured in the Chavantes reservoir varied between 10 m (CHUp) and 74.4 m 



18 
 

(CHDam) in the wet season and between 15 m (CH1) and 79.2 m (CHDam) in the dry 

season. 

Figure 6 shows the variations of the reservoir level and flow throughout the 

year, as well as the variation of the water transparency at the different sampling sites. 

A variation of 3.5 m in the reservoir water level was observed during the year with the 

lowest value in January (average of 470 m) and higher in April (average of 473.5 m). 

The highest flow occurred in December, average of 416 m

.  

Lower values of water transparency were observed at station CH1, even in wet 

(0.8 m) and in dry period (0.9 m). CHDam exhibited the highest values, 5.5 m (wet 

season) and 4.2 (dry season). A clear longitudinal gradient increase (upstream to dam), 

was observed both in wet (6.9 X) and dry (8.7 X) seasons.

The water temperature profiles (Fig. 7) were homogeneous or relatively 

homogeneous only at the CHUp, with water column values varying from 25-26 
o
C, in 

wet season, and from 20-22 
o
C, in dry season. Thermal stratifications of different 

amplitudes occurred in the others sampling stations. At CHDam, CH3 and CH4 the 

stratifications were accentuated, especially in summer, with a difference between the 

surface and bottom up to 10 
o
C. In CH1 and CH2 the amplitude was lower, with 3-4 

o
C 

decline towards the bottom.

The concentrations of dissolved oxygen (Fig. 8) in the wet and dry seasons 

exhibited a small increase in the sub-superficial layers and a decreasing trend towards 

the bottom, except for CHUp. At this site, the values were practically homogeneous 

along the water column, with an average value of 10.07 mg l
-1

 in wet and 8.95 mg l

 in 

dry season. At CHDam, CH3 and CH4 sites, in the wet period, there was a drop in 

oxygen concentrations (2 or 3 mg l
-1

) from 25 meters deep, with a gradual decrease to 

the bottom. Mean values ranged from 7.65 mg l
-1

 in CHDam to 10.07 mg l
-1

 in the 

CHUp in wet season and between 7.51 mg l

Figure 8 - Dissolved oxygen profiles at the Chavantes reservoir sampling sites in the 
2011 wet and dry seasons. 
 

The values of conductivity, pH, turbidity, total and suspended solids, 

biochemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, thermo tolerant 

coliforms and chlorophyll a for Chavantes reservoir are shown in Figure 9. 

The conductivity ranged from 50.74 ?S cm
-1

 (CHUp) to 54.86 ?S cm
-1

(CH1) in 

the wet season and between 50.77 ?S cm
-1

(CHUp) and 56.06 ?S cm
-1

(CH2) in the dry 

season. 

The pH values showed a great seasonal variation, tending to a more basic 

condition in the wet season (between 7 and 8) and intermediate in the dry period 

(between 6 and 8). 

Higher turbidity was observed in the wet season at CH1, 28.51 NTU, and CH2, 

14.85 NTU, and the lower values at CHUp, 1.98 NTU, and CH4, 2.48 NTU. The values 

measured in the dry season ranged from 5.39 NTU (CH3) to 21.62 NTU (CH1). 

The values of total solids determined in the wet season varied from 11.3 mg l
-1

, 

CH4, to 56.3 mg l
-1

, CH2. Higher values occurred during the dry season, between 61.3 

mg l
-1

, CH2, and 72.7 mg l
-1

, CHDam. 



21 
 

Higher suspended solids values were found at stations CH1, Itararé axis 

upstream site, and CHDam. Suspended solids in wet season ranged between 0.39 mg l
-

1
, CH41 and 0.61 mg l

-1
, CHDam to 4.37 mg l

-1
, CH1. In dry season the highest 

concentration was found at CHDam 15.77 mg l
-1

 and lower concentrations (&lt;2) were 

observed at CH2 and CH3. The inorganic matter fraction exceeds the organic fraction in 

all the Itararé axis sampled sites (CH1, CH2 and CH3). At the Paranapanema axis 

sampled sites (CHUp, CH4 and CHDam), the organic fraction was higher than the 

inorganic fraction, except for CHDam during the wet season. 

Total nitrogen concentration in the water showed the highest values in the CH3 

(392.98 ?g l
-1

) and CH2 sites (406.03 ?g l
-1

), in the wet season and at CH1 (302.05 ?g l
-1

) 

in dry season. The lower values occurred at CH4, 301.88 ?g l
-1 

(wet) and 197.87 ?g l
-1 

(dry season). 

The total phosphorus concentrations ranged from 12.81 (CH4) to 39.76 ?g l
-1 

(CHDam) in the wet season. The CHDam high value is probably due to the high 

concentration found in the depth of 35 meters (86.67 ?g l
-1

), just below the formation 

of the thermocline, where an increase of turbidity was detected too. In the dry period, 

the values were much lower ranging from 5.34 ?g l
-1

, CHDam and 9.05 ?g l
-1

, CH1. 

Among the sampled sites, the lowest values of biochemical oxygen demand 

were observed at station CHUp, with 0.5 mg l
-1

 O2 (wet season) and CH3, 0.6 mg l
-1

 O2 

(dry season). The highest values occurred in CH3, 1.3 mg l
-1

 O2 (wet) and 1.6 mg l
-1

 O2 

(dry season). 

Thermo tolerant coliforms ranged from&amp;lt;3 NMP/100ml (CH1 and CH2) to 43 

MNP/100ml at CHUp, wet season and between&amp;lt;3 NMP/100ml, CH4 and 23 

NMP/100ml, CHup during dry season. 

The chlorophyll a concentration ranged from 0.44 ?g l
-1

 (CH3) to 1.07 ?g l
-1

 

(CH1) in wet season, and between 0.53 ?g l
-1

 (CH4) to 1.96 ?g l
-1 

(CHDam) in dry 

season. 

The trophic status show excellent water quality with Ultraoligotrophic state for 

all sampled sites in the reservoir. Except for one isolated value of high total 

phosphorus (CHDam – 39.76 ?g l
-1

, wet season) all parameters were in agreement with 

CONAMA Resolution 357/2005 standards for Class 1 (Table 4).

Salto Grande reservoir 

Salto Grande reservoir is a 12 km
2
 run-off-river system, not dendritic (6.6 shore 

line development index) and with about 2 days retention time (Table 4).The depths 

measured in the Salto Grande reservoir varied between 3.5 m (SGUp) and 10.2 m 

(SGDam) in the wet season and between 2.3 m (SGUp) and 10.7 m (SGDam) in the dry 

season. 

Figure 10 shows the variations of the reservoir level and flow throughout the 

studied year and also the variation of the water transparency in the different sampling 

sites. There was a minor variation in the level of the reservoir during the year (&amp;lt;0.5 m). 

The highest flow occurred in January, approximately 357 m

. 

The lowest values of water transparency were observed in SG1 (0.25 m, wet 

and 0.55 m dry season). The highest values in SG2, with 3.5 m (wet season) and 3.4 

(dry season) and SGUp, 3.5 m (wet season). 

 

 

Figure 10 – Reservoir level and flow variation throughout the year (monthly average) 
and water transparency at the Salto Grande reservoir sampling sites in the 2011 wet 
and dry seasons. 
 

The water temperature profiles (Fig. 11) showed isotherm condition in wet 

season at SGUp, SG2 and SG1 sites, with values between 24 and 26 
o
C. In SG3, a 

superficial stratification was observed in the first meter of depth, with a difference of 

up to 4 °C between surface and bottom. At the SGDam, stratification near the surface 

of 1 
o
C was observed, indicating a daily phenomenon. During the dry season all 



24 
 

sampled sites showed isothermal condition, or small decreasing gradients. The water 

temperature varied between 22.42 
o
C in the SGUp and 24.25 

o
C in the SG1 (Fig. 11).

line development index) and with about 4 days retention time (Table 4). The depths 

measured in the Canoas II reservoir varied between 8 m (CIIUp) and 13 m (CIIDam) in 

the wet season and between 9.5 m (CIIUp) and 15.5 m (CIIDam) in the dry season. 

Figure 14 shows the variations of the reservoir level and flow throughout the 

year and also the variation of the water transparency in the different sampling sites. 

There was no significant variation in the reservoir level during the year. The highest 

flow occurred in January, approximately 565 m

Temperature profiles along the water column (Fig. 15) show isothermal 

conditions, or slight gradual decrease with depth. The mean values for the water 

column varied between 25-26 °C in the wet season and between 22.5 and 23.2 °C in 

the dry season. A heat accumulation tendency in the dam region (CIIDam) was verified 

during the dry season, where the average temperature of the water column was 



29 
 

slightly warmer than in the other sampled sites, mainly due to higher values on surface 

(up to 5 m).

CANOAS I reservoir 

Canoas I reservoir is a 30.85 km
2
 run-off-river system, not dendritic (6.1 shore 

line development index) and with about 6 days retention time (Table 4). The depth 

varied between 4 m (CIUp) and 14.2 m (CIdam) in wet season and between 2 m (CIUp) 

and 25.2 m (CIDam) in dry season. 

Figure 18 shows the variations of reservoir level and flow throughout the year 

and also the water transparency in the different sampled sites. We can observe that 

there was no change in the reservoir level during the year. The highest flow occurred 

in January, approximately 609 m
3
 s

-1
, while lower ones occurred in June (413 m

3
 s

-1
). 

A considerable increase of transparency was observed and dry season, compared 

to wet. In March, The lowest value of water transparency was observed in CIDam, 1.4 

m (wet season), and at CIUp, with 2 m (dry season), while the highest was observed at 

CI1, 2.3 m (wet) and 3.6 m (dry). 

 

 

Figure 18 – Reservoir level and flow variation throughout the year (monthly average) 
and water transparency at the Canoas I reservoir sampling sites in the 2011 wet and 
dry seasons. 
 

The temperature profiles along the water column show isothermal conditions 

in both sampled periods (Fig. 19), with values around 25-26 
o
C (wet) and 22-24 

o
C (dry 

season). At CIDam and C1, a higher average temperature was observed in relation to 

CIUp, probably due to a tendency of heat accumulation in the more lentic zone - less 

advective transport, deeper and of greater volume. Close to surface micro-

stratification trends were observed in wet season, whit a small decrease in 



34 
 

temperature (1 
o
C) in the first 2 m depth at CIDam and CI1. It is a daily phenomenon of 

surface heating, and in the dry season, the same was observed in CIDam, with lower 

amplitude of variation, 0.5 
o
C.

ROSANA reservoir 

Rosana reservoir is a 220 km
2
 run-off-river system, not dendritic (8.2 shore line 

development index) and with about 17 days of water retention time (Table 4).The 

depth ranged from 8.5 m (RS1) to 27 m (RS2) in the wet season and from 7 m (RS1) to 

25.9 m (RSDam) in the dry season. 

Figure 30 shows the variations of the reservoir level and flow throughout the 

year and also the water transparency in the sampled sites. We can observe that there 

was no significant variation in the reservoir level during the year. The highest flow was 

observed in February, approximately 1679 m
3
 s

-1
, while lower values occurred in the 

period of May (1014 m
3
 s

). 

The water transparency values were similar in all sampled sites in the wet 

season, varying between 1.3 m (RS2) and 1.6 m (RS1 and RSUp). However, in the dry 

season differences were much higher, between 0.3 m, RS1, and 2.8 m, RS2.

The temperature profiles (Fig. 31) show that a homogeneous tendency 

prevailed in the wet season, with values around 26.5 
o

temperature in the surface region was very high, near 28 
o
C. In the dry season it was 

observed isotherm conditions with temperature values around 23-24

season and from 3.94 NTU, RSDam, to 154.79 NTU, RS1, in the dry season. The high 

value observed in the dry season is atypical and is due to the effect of a large rainfall 

occurring at the time of sampling. 

Total solids ranged from 64 mg l

and from 64.3 mg l

inorganic fraction exceeded the organic fraction, except for RSDam, in the wet season, 

and the inorganic fraction exceeded the organic fraction at RSUp and RS1 in the dry 

period. 

Homogeneous values of total nitrogen concentration among the sampled sites 

occurred in the same season. Mean values were higher in the wet season, 

approximately 700 ?g l

The total phosphorus concentrations in the water ranged from 20.27 ?g l

in dry season. 

The thermo tolerant coliforms values varied between&amp;lt;3 NMP/100ml, (RSDam, 

(wet and RS2, dry season) and 21 MNP/100ml, (RS1, wet and RS2, wet and dry season).

The first two axes (PC1 and PC2) of the principal component analysis 

corresponded to 48.3% of the ordering of the sampled sites in relation to the 

limnological variables (Table 5; Fig. 34). 

In the first axis (PC1) the transparency, turbidity, inorganic suspended solids, 

organic suspended solids and chlorophyll a were the variables with greater influence 

on the ordering of the points. In axis two (PC2) the distribution was mainly influenced 

by temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, total nitrogen and total phosphorus (Table 5; 

Fig. 34). The analysis demonstrates the strong influence of seasonality in the cascade 

of Paranapanema reservoirs.

Discussion 

Jurumirim reservoir 

The Jurumirim reservoir exhibit a spatial organization pattern typical of large 

reservoirs, where gradual changes (gradient) of physical, chemical and biological 

conditions occur along the main axis established between the upstream (lotic zone) 

and the dam (lentic zone). For example, it was observed a clear increasing tendency, 

approximately 5 times, of transparency towards the dam for both seasons, and the 

opposite for turbidity and suspended solids. The reservoir showed a stratification 

tendency in the wet-warmer period (late summer – March), which has a strong 

influence on the limnology of the system. Oxygen values, for example, were high along 

the water column, except for the deep zone of the dam region during the wet season 

(&lt;5mg l
-1

), certainly due to an extended period of summer stratification. The pH, as 

well as the temperature, also presented a considerable seasonal variation, with more 

basic values in the wet season and neutral or slightly acid in the dry season. Only at the 



55 
 

JR2 station, a slightly higher value of chlorophyll (around 3.0 ?g l
-1

) was recorded, as a 

function of the local hydrodynamics, since this is an arm with little circulation of the 

water.  

Chavantes reservoir 

Initially, it is important to consider that the sampling design for Chavantes 

reservoir is based on the existence of two "longitudinal axes": one of them formed 

along the Itararé River Valley (CH1, CH2 and CH3), with lateral insertion into the 

Paranapanema River, and the other corresponding to the Paranapanema River 

channel, properly (CHUp, CH4 and CHDam). The analysis of the limnological 

characteristics of Chavantes reservoir corroborates the occurrence of these two large 

distinct compartments. In general, variables such as turbidity, suspended solids, total 

nitrogen and total phosphorus (in this case only for wet season) exhibited lower values 

in the Paranapanema axis, compared to the Itararé axis. 

In both spatial axes a longitudinal pattern of increase of water transparency 

towards the dam was also observed, with the highest values in the Paranapanema axis 

(CHUp, CH4 and CHDam). Unlike the upper areas of the reservoir, the transparency in 

the lacustrine zone is less affected by the summer heavy rains. 

Due to its large size, and by the fact that it is operated as a storage system, 

there is a large seasonal variation of the water level. The pH values observed in the 

Chavantes reservoir showed a high seasonal variation, tending to a more acidic 

condition in the dry season and more basic in wet season. However, the influence of 

important factors associated with the annual variation of precipitation (e.g. sediment 

supply) is limited to upstream zones, mainly on the Itararé axis. 

With the exception of the CHUp, the Chavantes reservoir had a well defined 

thermal stratification, mainly in the central channel and lacustrine zone near the dam. 

The variation of dissolved oxygen corroborates the temperature patterns, in 

general, decreasing with depth in the wet and dry season. Low oxygen values were 

measured in the deep zones of the lentic region. This shows that this compartment, 

due to the high depth, has a limited vertical circulation. A good indicator of the 

reservoir water quality condition is the low chlorophyll a values (maximum around 2 

?g l
-1

). 



56 
 

 

Salto Grande reservoir 

Although it is a relatively small reservoir, there is a wide spatial and temporal 

variation of the limnological conditions and water quality in Salto Grande reservoir. 

The study demonstrates the influence of seasonality and compartmentalization on the 

physical, chemical and biological characteristics of water. The importance of the 

contribution of the tributary rivers to the central body of the reservoir is also an 

extremely relevant factor. The transparency of water, for example, is high in the 

upstream region (SGUp) influenced by the waters of the Chavantes reservoir 

(Paranapanema River) located upstream, and low at the mouth of the Pardo River 

(SG1). The opposite pattern of variation, as expected, was verified for turbidity and 

suspended solids. In the case of turbidity values&amp;lt;5 NTU occurred in the SGUp and SG2 

(wet and dry seasons) and &gt;80 NTU in SG1 (wet season). 

It is a reservoir where isothermal conditions prevail, with continuous and 

complete mixing of the water column (high oxygen values). Tendency for surface 

stratification (microstratification) during the wet season in the lentic region was 

detected. The pH values observed in the Salto Grande reservoir showed a significant 

seasonal variation, with more neutral values in the wet season and slightly basic ones 

in the wet season. 

The highest concentrations of total nitrogen were observed at SG1 9Pardo river 

mouth) and SGDam, also under the influence of Pardo River. The same occurred for 

total phosphorus and chlorophyll a. 

Canoas II reservoir 

The results for Canoas II reservoir demonstrate the existence of a moderate 

spatial gradient between the upstream zone and the dam zone. Seasonally important 

changes in the dynamics of the system were observed. There was an increasing trend 

of transparency towards the dam (lentic environment). Likewise, a decreasing 

longitudinal gradient of the turbidity and suspended solids concentration was 

observed. 



57 
 

In terms of thermal structure, there was a prevalence of isothermal conditions 

or a slightly gradual decrease of temperature with depth. The concentrations of 

dissolved oxygen were high and had a vertical distribution pattern similar to that 

observed for temperature, with relatively homogeneous values along the water 

column or with small gradients. The pH values showed a considerable variation 

temporal variation, tending to a more basic condition in the wet season and 

intermediate values in the dry season. The concentrations of nutrients (nitrogen and 

phosphorus) were similar between the different regions of the reservoir for the same 

season. 

Canoas I reservoir 

The Canoas I reservoir is highly influenced by the seasonal variations. Spatially 

(longitudinal), it presented a moderate compartmentalization. A considerable 

reduction of water transparency was observed during the wet season period. 

Longitudinally there was an increase in transparency, with lower values at CIUp and 

higher values at CI1. The inverse, that is, a decreasing gradient towards the dam, was 

verified for suspended solids (wet season). 

Much higher concentrations of nutrients (nitrogen and total phosphorus) in 

water occurred in the wet season and lower in the dry season. 

During both season predominated isothermal profiles or micro stratification 

tendencies close to the surface in CI1 and CIDam. This thermal structure indicates a 

continuous circulation of the water mass in the system, resulting in a homogeneous or 

relatively homogeneous distribution of the others physical and chemical variables 

along the water column. An increasing gradient of chlorophyll a towards the dam zone 

occurred in the dry season. 

Capivara reservoir 

The results obtained in the Capivara reservoir demonstrate the great influence 

of both spatial compartmentalization and seasonal variation on the physical and 

chemical characteristics. An increasing longitudinal gradient of transparency evidences 

the highest light penetration in the lacustrine zone. The temperature profiles show 

different conditions along the reservoir. In the wet season it was seen increasing 



58 
 

gradients of temperature and superficial stratifications, contrasting to more isothermal 

conditions in the dry season. This variability in the thermal structure influenced the 

distribution of oxygen. In general, the concentrations were high, although slightly 

lower in summer due to the higher temperatures. 

The spatial compartmentalization of the system was also indicated by variations 

in the conductivity values between the different sampling sites. 

The pH values remained close to neutrality or were slightly basic. This variable 

is also an indicator of the spatial complexity of the system. 

In the dry season, there was a wide variation of the suspended solids 

concentration, up to 20 times, according to the sampling site. During this period there 

was a decreasing trend toward the dam. 

The concentrations of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) varied widely 

among the different compartments of the reservoir. The nutrients and chlorophyll a 

concentrations can be considered relatively high when compared to the other 

reservoirs of the Paranapanema River. 

Taquaruçu reservoir 

The results obtained in the Taquaruçu reservoir show a limited spatial 

compartmentalization. However, there was considerable seasonal changes. 

Although transparency values were higher in the dam area during dry season, a 

longitudinal gradient from the upstream was not evident. The same was observed for 

the suspended solids. 

Isothermal condition or small decreasing gradients of temperature, was 

observed at the different sampled sites along the reservoir. The continuous mixing 

condition of the water column causes the oxygen values to be high in both seasons. 

The pH was close to neutrality or slightly basic in the dry and wet season. The 

concentrations of nutrients were much higher in the rainy season. 

 

 

 

 

 



59 
 

Rosana reservoir 

The results obtained in the Rosana reservoir show a moderate influence of the 

spatial compartmentalization on the physical and chemical characteristics of the water. 

However, the effects of seasonality are clear. 

Water transparency, for example, showed lower values in the wet season and 

turbidity data were higher in both seasons There was no recurring tendency of 

increase or decrease in transparency along the main axis of the reservoir. However, a 

longitudinal decrease of the suspended material was verified for the wet season. 

In both seasons and sites the vertical profiles of temperature are homogeneous 

or have small decreasing gradients. This pattern determines the homogeneous 

distribution of oxygen throughout the water column. Comparatively, lower 

concentrations of oxygen occurred in the wet season, certainly due to the negative 

influence of higher temperatures. 

The pH was slightly basic in the wet season and intermediate in the dry season.  

The RS1 station is located in the river-reservoir transition zone of the reservoir, 

after a sharp curve of the river, where the sedimentation of particles is intense 

resulting in higher concentrations of nutrients and suspended solids, and also 

hlorophyll a (dry season). 

Nutrient concentrations (nitrogen and phosphorus) were higher in the wet 

season compared to dry season. 

 

Based on the limnological characteristics of each reservoir we can verify the 

distinctiveness of the two types of hydropower reservoirs defined in terms of 

functioning: storage and run-of-river systems. Both exhibit riverine, intermediate, and 

lentic compartments, but better discriminated in storage systems. In run-of-river 

reservoirs (short water retention time), the shape is generally simpler and shallower, 

and the water level variation has of low amplitude and high frequency (daily) as seen 

in Salto Grande, Canoas II, Canoas I, Taquaruçu and Rosana. Conversely, Jurumirim, 

Chavantes and Capivara are typical storage reservoir, with dendritic shapes, greater 

physical stability, depth, volume, area, and variation in water level, and also seasonal 

thermal stratification. Such patterns have been previously demonstrated in Brazil by 



60 
 

Soares et al. (2008), Nogueira et al. (2012) and Perbiche-Neves et al. (2013) and 

supports the second hypothesis proposed by this work. 

In a comparative study of Chavantes and Salto Grande Perbiche-Neves et al., 

(2013) detected that due to the longer water retention time and larger area, 

compartmentalization in Chavantes Reservoir was more evident. There was 

contrasting conditions between the lotic region and the intermediate/lentic one. The 

author also pointed out for Salto Grande that the lateral variability was proportionally 

more important with a clear influence of the Pardo River entrance, and also a certain 

degree of separation of Novo River entrance (correspond to our 16 site – SG3), 

especially due to the influx of water with lower transparency and higher 

concentrations of suspended solids. 

The rainfall pattern is similar along the cascade reservoirs, with higher values in 

summer (December-February) and lower in autumn/winter (April to September). This 

seasonal regime had already been identified as an important factor influencing the 

limnological functioning of the distinct Paranapanema River reservoirs (Nogueira et al., 

2002, 2006; Jorcin and Nogueira, 2005; Pagioro et al., 2005; Henry et al., 2006; 

Nogueira et al., 2012). 

According to Cunha et al. (2013) the prediction of trophic state may be more 

complex in tropical/subtropical freshwaters because there are more environmental 

constraints controlling nutrient dynamics and the phytoplankton responses in such 

water bodies. The main reason for establishing a specific index for tropical/subtropical 

reservoirs different from the Carlson’s one is that this classical model only considers 

the highest productive seasons in temperate lakes (spring and summer), whilst 

tropical/subtropical systems may have high primary production through the year (e.g. 

Calijuri and Santos, 2001). High rainfall in tropical/subtropical regions may increment 

the nonpoint sources from urban or agricultural areas and unbalance the 

biogeochemical cycles (Qin et al., 2010; Thothong et al., 2011; Cunha et al., 2013). High 

temperatures increase evaporation rates (Freire et al., 2009) and possibly affect the 

circulation movements in the reservoirs water column. 

The increasing trophic gradient observed along the cascade of Paranapanema 

River reservoirs is evidenced by differences in the concentration of total dissolved 

solids or particulates in water, reflecting variations of geological nature, soil use and 



61 
 

occupation, and precipitation/evaporation rate (Jorcin and Nogueira, 2005). Therefore, 

our first hypothesis is corroborated. The influence of the intensification of the land use 

in the Paranapanema River middle stretches is a determinant process, comparable to 

the influence of the river damming. 

The proper discrimination of the main tendencies of limnological variability and 

recurrent patterns could be useful to improve the programs of reservoirs 

environmental management as well as the water quality monitoring protocols.

Abstract 

In this study we indeed to apply, and compare the results, different types of water 

quality indices for multipurpose uses, such as water supply, trophy levels evaluation 

and aquatic communities protection. The selected indexes were Water Quality Index 

(WQI), Trophic State Index (Carlson, 1977 and some derived modified models), 

Phytoplankton Community Index (FCI), Zooplankton Community Index (ZCI) and the 

Planktonic Index of Biotic Integrity (P-IBI) - a new tool that has been recently 

developed. The Paranapanema River is one of the main tributaries of the high Paraná 

River (La Plata basin) and is the natural border between the states of Paraná and São 

Paulo, Southern Brazil. The study was carried out in eight reservoirs, Jurumirim (JR), 

Chavantes (CH), Salto Grande (SG), Canoas II (CII), Canoas I (CI), Capivara (CP), 

Taquaruçu (TQ) e Rosana (RS), arranged in a cascade system considering a total of 37 

sampling sites and two seasons. The objective is to generated new insights on this 

theme in order to improve the present water quality monitoring programs and to 

validate new useful protocols at the regional scale – a relatively large watershed from 

Southeast Brazil. The Water Quality Index ranged from “Good” to “Excellent” 

demonstrating the good quality of water. The original model of Carlson (1977) shows 

an overestimation by sensitively increasing the levels of eutrophication of the 

reservoirs while TSI models proposed by Carlson modified by Toledo and CETESB, 

(2006) for reservoirs are more suitable for tropical and subtropical environments, and 

TSI for tropical/subtropical reservoirs is the most sensitive. The Communities Indices

FCI, ZCI, P-IBI can fairly represent water quality standards which were reinforced, 

especially for zooplankton, through correlations made in this study. 

Resumo  

Neste estudo, aplicamos e comparamos os resultados de diferentes tipos de índices de 

qualidade de água para múltiplos usos, como abastecimento de água, avaliação de 

níveis tróficos e proteção de comunidades aquáticas. Os índices selecionados foram: o 

Índice de Qualidade da Água (WQI), o Índice de Estado Trófico (Carlson, 1977 e alguns 

modelos modificados), o Índice de Comunidade Fitoplanctônica (FCI), o Índice de 

Comunidade Zooplanctônica (ZCI) e o Índice Planctônico de Integridade Biótica (P-IBI) - 

uma nova ferramenta que foi recentemente desenvolvida. O Rio Paranapanema é um 

dos principais afluentes do Alto Rio Paraná (bacia do Prata) e é fronteira natural entre 

os estados do Paraná e São Paulo, no sul do Brasil. O estudo foi realizado em oito 

reservatórios, Jurumirim (JR), Chavantes (CH), Salto Grande (SG), Canoas II (CII), Canoas 

I (CI), Capivara (CP), Taquaruçu (TQ) e Rosana ), dispostos em cascata e considerando 

um total de 37 locais de amostragem em duas estações. O objetivo é gerar novos 

insights sobre esse tema para melhorar os atuais programas de monitoramento da 

qualidade da água e validar novos protocolos úteis à escala regional – em uma bacia 

hidrográfica relativamente grande do Sudeste do Brasil. O Índice de Qualidade da Água 

variou entre "Bom" e "Excelente" demonstrando a boa qualidade da água. O modelo 

original proposto por Carlson, (1977) do Índice de Estado Trófico (TSI) mostra uma 

superestimação ao aumentar sensivelmente os níveis de eutrofização dos 

reservatórios enquanto que os modelos propostos por Carlson modificados por Toledo 

e CETESB, (2006) para reservatórios, são mais adequados para ambientes tropicais e 

subtropicais, enquanto o TSI para tropicais/subtropicais se mostrou o mais sensível 

para os ambientes estudados. Os índices de comunidades FCI, ZCI, P-IBI podem 

representar adequadamente padrões de qualidade da água, reforçada neste estudo, 

especialmente para a comunidade zooplanctônica, através de correlações desta com 

as variáveis limnológicas e os índices de qualidade de água e estado trófico.

Introduction 

As complex ecological systems with multiple uses, reservoirs present a 

hierarchy of functions, mechanisms of feedback, regulation, and control (Tundisi, 

2008). In order to assess such complex systems, the use of integrated indices and 

indicators are frequently used in environmental monitoring programs and are 

generally based on selected abiotic factors or community structure indicators (Thomaz, 

2000). 

Environmental indices and indicators emerged as result of the growing social 

concern for the environmental aspects of socioeconomic development, a process that 

requires a large number of information organized in distinct degrees of complexity 

(CETESB, 2015). The main goal of indices is to assess the present condition of the 

environment and monitor trends over time. They can provide an early warning signal 

of changes in the environment and they be used to diagnose the causes of 

environmental problems (Dale and Beyeler, 2001). 

Environmental indicators should represent key information about structure, 

function, and composition of the ecosystem (Dale and Beyeler 2001). They need to 

capture the ecosystem complexities but remain simple enough to be easily and 

routinely monitored and have the following criteria: be easily measured, be sensitive 

to stresses on the system, respond to stress in a predictable manner, be anticipatory, 

predict changes that can be averted by management actions, be integrative, have a 

known response to disturbances, anthropogenic stresses, and changes over time, and 

have low variability in response (Dale and Beyeler 2001). 

The most challenging problem on selection of environmental indices and 

indicators is to understand the fundamental principles of ecology, also the inherent 

complexity of environmental problems and the limitations of using just a single 

indicator or indices that integrate information across a range of attributes and/or 

different levels of biological organization (Thornton and Kennedy, 1999; Wetzel, 2001). 



73 
 

 Appropriate water quality indices can be useful for management purposes – 

stakeholder’s decision processes, improvement of monitoring protocols, and 

expansion of scientific knowledge, as well as to disseminate the results of the analyses 

to citizens (Kane at al., 2009) and to make it possible is inherent to take into account 

that a proper choice of an index or indicators must be intrinsically related to the 

studied environment and will often present such regional character, which means that 

they will probably need some adaptation, but always taking into account the thought 

on which this was based. 

In São Paulo State (Brazil), the official environmental agency called Companhia 

de Tecnologia de Saneamento Ambiental (CETESB), has monitored the water bodies for 

almost three decades, always focused on public supply requirements. Nevertheless, 

most surficial water ecosystems of this State are considered as Class 1 and 2 (Decree 

No. 10,755) (São Paulo, 1977), which are equivalent to Special Class and Class 1 of the 

federal CONAMA Resolution 357 (Brazil, 2005). This legislation predicts a more 

comprehensive set of uses including "to preserve the balance natural of aquatic 

communities". Therefore, it is important that the water quality monitoring programs 

also consider the biota composition and structure. 

 According to this, the Special Class is destined: a) to the supply for human 

consumption, with disinfection; B) the preservation of the natural balance of aquatic 

communities; and (c) the preservation of aquatic environments in fully protected 

conservation units, while Class 1 may be destined for: (a) supply for human 

consumption after simplified treatment; (b) protection of aquatic communities; (c) 

recreation of primary contact, such as swimming, water skiing and diving, (d) irrigation 

of raw vegetables and fruits that grow on the ground and are eaten raw without film 

removal; and (e) the protection of aquatic communities in Indigenous lands. 

 Although there is not an ideal model to measure environmental impacts, there 

are available options for selection and development of indices and indicators. More 

applied approaches have been requested by engineers and managers who work in the 

management of reservoirs, in order to complement the basic limnological studies 

performed by academic institutions (Tundisi and Matsumura-Tundisi, 2003; Tundisi, 

2006). 



74 
 

Based on a study carried out in the 1970’s by the National Sanitation 

Foundation of United States, CETESB adapted and developed a regional Water Quality 

Index (WQI) to assess the water quality with the purpose of public supply. The WQI 

consider nine parameters: water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, biochemical 

oxygen demand, thermotolerant coliforms, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total 

solids, and turbidity). The WQI is a widely accepted index and commonly used in water 

quality monitoring and the proposal was based on an opinion survey (Delphi method) 

with specialists in water quality. They were argued about the variables to be evaluated, 

the relative weight and the condition with which each parameter is presented, mainly 

in order to evaluate the contamination of the water bodies caused by the discharge of 

domestic sewage (CETESB 2006). 

A trophic state index for temperate lakes was proposed by Carlson (1977), 

considering empirical relationships among Chlorophyll a (Chl a), Total Phosphorus (TP) 

and Secchi disk depth (SDD). This index has frequently been applied by researchers and 

government institutions to, indirectly, estimate the algal biomass and indicate lake 

trophic status. However, it is known that the relationships and the equations for 

calculating the index should be adapted when applied to aquatic systems different 

from those studied by Carlson. Otherwise results of the index application can lead to 

misclassification of the trophic status of a water body (Cunha et al., 2013). 

Currently, in Brazil, there are modifications of Carlson original model´s based on 

the prediction that the trophic state may be more complex in tropical/subtropical 

freshwaters because there are more environmental constraints controlling nutrient 

dynamics and phytoplankton responses in such water bodies (Cunha et al., 2013). 

These modifications take into account the same reasoning, but they present changes in 

the calculation, in the number of variables analyzed and also in the weighting given to 

each one of them. 

Although the previously mentioned indices are widely recognized and used, in 

1998, the SMA
1
-65 Resolution (São Paulo, 1998) established a working group to revise 

the Water Quality Index (WQI) in order to consider the aquatic biota and develop 

other assessment methods, which consider biological indicators integrated with to 

eutrophication indexes. This technical group was composed of experts from CETESB,

Universities and Research Institutes that generated a first version for biological indexes 

based on phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthos and fish communities (CETESB, 2006). 

We selected two of the proposed indices, the Phytoplankton Community Index (FCI) 

and the Zooplankton Community Index (ZCI) for reservoirs, for our study. 

In this study we applied, and compared, different types of water quality indices 

that are considered to be appropriated for assessment of aquatic ecosystems for 

multipurpose uses (e.g. water supply, hydropower generation, aquaculture, recreation, 

irrigation, aquatic community’s protection). Our case study is focused on the 

Paranapanema River Reservoir Cascade. The following indexes were selected: Water 

Quality Index (WQI), Trophic State Index (Carlson, 1977 and three regionally modified 

models), Phytoplankton Community Index (FCI), Zooplankton Community Index (ZCI) 

and the Planktonic Index of Biotic Integrity (P-IBI) - a new tool that has been recently 

developed (see more details in Chapter 4). 

The objective of the study is to get new insights on this subject, contributing for 

the evaluation and improvement of the water quality monitoring program carried out 

in a large hydrographic basin from Southeast Brazil. 

Additionally, we present an exploratory analysis on plankton, mainly 

zooplankton, responses to water quality and trophic conditions variability in the 

Paaranapanema basin. The perspective is to incorporate available academic 

information on practical protocols for environmental evaluation and management. 

Phytoplankton and zooplankton samples are regularly sampled and analyzed as part of 

the regional water quality monitoring program sponsored by the hydropower 

generation company. 

Study area 

The study was carried out in the Paranapanema River Reservoirs Cascade 

considering the same eight reservoirs and 37 sampling sites described in Chapter 1 

(Fig. 1; Tables 1 and 2).

Materials and methods 

The Water Quality Index (WQI) was calculated using nine variables: water 

temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, thermotolerant 

coliforms, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total solids, and turbidity. The 

methodologies concerning each individual variable (sampling and analysis) are detailed 

in Chapter 1. The WQI calculation was performed according to CETESB (2006) 

methodology and the results, which can range from 0 to 100 (the higher the value the 

better the water quality), were classified according to Table 1, also a CETESB (2006) 

methodology recommendation.

Very Poor WQI ? 19 

 

For the Trophic State Indices four variables were used: Secchi disc 

transparency, total phosphorus, reactive soluble phosphorus and chlorophyll a. 

Sampling methods and analysis for each variables are also detailed in Chapter 1. To 

calculate the indices we used the original model proposed by Carlson (1977) and the 

Carson Index modified by Toledo (1983) (apud Mercante and Tucci, 1999), by CETESB 

(2009) - Trophic State Index for reservoirs and by Cunha et al. (2013) - Trophic State 

Index for tropical/subtropical reservoirs. The classification is in accordance with each 

method, which has variations in the rating values and categories (in this case, the 

lower the value the better the water quality), but, to facilitate comparison, the similar 

classifications were represented in the same colors (Table 2).

The Phytoplankton Community Index for Reservoirs (FCI) and the Zooplankton 

Community Index for Reservoirs (ZCI) were both calculated according to CETESB 

(2006). For the FCI Index it is considered the proportion of the main community groups 

and/or the density of the organisms and the concentration of chlorophyll a or TSI (Chl 

a). However, the numerically dominant group of phytoplankton in the Paranapanema 

River reservoirs cascade, Cryptophyceae, is not considered in the model. Therefore, for 

this analysis we used the total density (org. ml
-1

) instead of the phytoplanktonic 

dominant groups, as well as the Trophic State Index, Carlson modified by Toledo model 

for Chlorophyll a. For the ZCI it is considered the presence of the three main 

zooplankton groups (Rotifers, Copepods and Cladocerans), Calanoida/Cyclopoida ratio 

and TSI. (Carlson modified by Toledo) (see CETESB, 2006). 

For phytoplankton qualitative analysis, an integrated sample was collected 

(entire water column) at each sampling station through vertical net hauls (20 ?m of 

mesh size) and immediately preserved in 2% formalin. The net samples were observed 

in an optical microscope (maximum magnification of 1000×) for taxonomical 

identification and determination of the assemblage total richness. For phytoplankton 

quantitative analysis, three unfiltered samples were collected (van Dorn bottle) at the 

subsurface (ca. 0.2 m), middle of the water column and near to the bottom (ca. 1 m 

above the sediment). The samples were fixed and preserved with Lugol’s solution. 

After sedimentation, the organisms (cell, colony, and filament) were counted using 

inverted microscopy (sensu Utermöhl) at a magnification of 400×. At least 120 optical 

fields distributed in parallel transects were examined, and at least 150 organisms were 

counted per sample. A mean value for the water column was calculated for further use 

in the FCI index. Since the dominant phytoplankton group (Cryptophyceae) in 



78 
 

Paranapanema River reservoirs cascade does not appear in the CETESB classification 

table, we use only the organisms’ density and the trophic state. 

The zooplankton samples were collected using a conical net (30 cm mouth 

diameter and 50 ?m mesh size) for vertical hauls from near bottom (ca. 1 m) to the 

surface. In each site we collected to identical samples, one for qualitative and the 

other for quantitative purpose. Samples were fixed and preserved in 4 % 

formaldehyde. For the quantitative analyses, most organisms were counted at species 

level. Rotifera, and nauplii of Copepoda were counted in Sedgwick–Rafter chambers, 

under optic microscope Zeiss Standard 25 (at a magnification of × 200); and Cladocera, 

copepodites and adult stages of Copepoda were counted using a stereo microscope 

Zeiss Stemi SV 6 (maximum magnification of × 120). At least 150 specimens were 

counted per subsample. Additional sub-samples, or even the entire sample, were 

analyzed when the density of organisms was low (generally less than 100 organisms 

per 5 ml of sample, in case of Cladocera and Copepoda, and less than 100 organisms 

per 1 ml of sample, in case of Rotifera). 

Both phytoplankton and zooplankton were sampled during wet/summer 

(March/2011) and dry/spring (October/2011) seasons. 

The Planktonic Index of Biotic Integrity (P-IBI) was calculated according to 

methodology detailed in Chapter 4. As this index is derived from a proposal developed 

for natural large lakes, it was only used for the Paranapanema storage reservoirs 

(theoretical water retention time higher than 100 days) (Jurumirim, Chavantes and 

Capivara). 

To facilitate comparisons, the classification rating was also showed in term of 

corresponding colors, equivalent for similar categories of the distinct indices. The FCI 

for reservoir and P-IBI is according to Table 3 (with the lower the value of the 

classification corresponding to the better the water quality) and ZCI for reservoirs 

Table 4.

In order to reinforce the potential of the zooplankton as bioindicator of water 

quality and corroborate the effectiveness of the Zooplankton Community Index for 

Reservoirs (ZCIres) and Plankton Index of Biotic Integrity (P-IBI), we performed an 

exploratory analysis using the Pearson correlation (Pearson, p&lt;0,05) Statistic v. 7.0 

(Statsoft, 2002). 

The following genera or species of zooplankton were settled on as indicators of 

trophic state from a selected literature review: Brachionus sp., Collotheca sp. and 

Filinia sp. among Rotifers; Argyrodiaptomus sp., Notodiaptomus iheringi, 

Thermocyclops decipiens, and Thermocylops minutus, among the Copepods; and 

Bosmina sp. and Daphnia sp. among Cladocerans. Additionally we considered the total 

abundance and richness of Rotifera, Cladocera and Copepoda (with and without 

nauplii) and the relation Calanoida/Cyclopoida + Cladocera. Zooplankton data were 



80 
 

correlated with the limnological variables (transparency, dissolved oxygen, biochemical 

oxygen demand, conductivity, chlorophyll, total phosphorus, soluble reactive 

phosphorus, total nitrogen, total suspended solids, organic suspended solids, inorganic 

suspended solids) (Chapter 1) and with the quantitative results of WQI and modified 

Carlson T.S.Is indexes for reservoirs (CETESB, 2006) and for tropical and subtropical 

reservoirs (Cunha et al., 2013). We selected some results for graphical presentation. 

All data, except pH, were log-transformed and the parametric distributions was 

verified in the software Statistic v. 7.0 (Statsoft, 2002). 

The selection of zooplankton metrics is based on published information which 

was carried out using a selected literature review, focused on the studied environment 

and which have regionalized characteristics of the occurrence and distribution of the 

organisms in the Paranapanema River reservoirs and in São Paulo State reservoirs with 

different trophic states as well as some classical related literature that showed the 

potential indicator of this community. The accumulated experience of our research 

group can be found in Sendacz et al., (1985); Panarelli et al., (2001); Nogueira, (2001); 

Sampaio et al., (2002); Matsumura-Tundisi and Tundisi,(2003); Casanova and Henry, 

(2004); Lansac-Toha et al., (2004); Matsumura-Tundisi and Tundisi, (2005); Landa et al., 

(2007); Nogueira et al., (2008); Tundisi, (2008); Silva, (2008); Sartori et al., (2009); 

Perbiche-Neves and Nogueira, (2010); Perbiche-Neves et al., (2016) and Nogueira and 

Naliato, (2016). 

For all index calculations were used the mean value for the water column for 

the limnological variables, except transparency. 

Results 

The Water Quality Index (CEYESB 2006) for the Paranapanema River reservoirs 

cascade resulted in only two distinct classifications, Good and Excellent (Table 5, 

Appendix I). Among the 74 determinations the Excellent condition widely prevailed (64 

times) over the Good condition (10 times). The index evidences a decrease in the 

water quality condition during the wet season. In this period the proportion of 

sampling stations considered Excellent corresponded to 81.1 % and in the dry season it 

was 91.9 %. 



81 
 

In order to facilitate comparison among the different models of Trophic State 

Index applied for the Paranapanema River reservoirs cascade all the results are 

showed in Table 6. Lower levels of trophy were obtained when used the Carlson Index 

(1977). Results ranged from Hypereutrophic (SG1) to Oligotrophic (CH3, CH4 and 

CHDam) in the wet season and from Hypereutrophic (CP1 and CP2) to Oligotrophic 

(JR3, JRDam and CHDam) in the dry season. Most sampling sites (70.3 % considering 

both seasons) were classified as Mesotrophic according to this index. The same 

number (8 times) of lower trophic conditions (Hypereutrophic/Eutrophic) was found in 

wet and dry seasons. 

For the Carlson Trophic State Index modified by Toledo (Mercante and Tucci, 

1999), the Eutrophic condition was determined four times (SG1, wet season; CP1, CP2 

and RS1, dry season). All others classifications varied between Oligo (71.6 %) and 

Mesotrophic (21.6 %) conditions, during both wet and dry seasons (Table 6). Following 

the original Carlson Index this model also indicates a decrease in the water quality 

during the rainy season. 

The results of the Trophic State Index for Reservoirs proposed by CETESB (2006) 

are similar to the ones of Carlson modified by Toledo, showing the predominance of 

Oligotrophic and Mesotrophic conditions, 29.7 and 59.5% of the determinations, 

respectively (Table 6). The stations with the best trophic conditions according to this 

model were JR3, JRDam and CH3, which were classified as Ultraolithotrophic during 

the dry season when was detected an improvement of the water quality. 

The most recent model of Trophic State Index proposed for tropical and 

subtropical reservoirs (Cunha et al., 2013) indicated predominance of Ultraoligotrophic 

conditions, corresponding to 77.0 % of the sampling sites (Table 6), followed by 

Oligotrophic condition (17.6 %). The index was also sensitive to poor condidition in wer 

season, when one sites was classified as Eutrophic (SG1). The total results of the TSI 

models presented here are shown in Appendices II, III, IV and V. 

The use of Phytoplankton Community Index for reservoir (FCI) resulted in 

similar proportion of Good and Excellent conditions, 47.3 and 51.3 % of the 

determinations, respectively (Table 7). Only one Regular condition was detected (SG1, 

wet season). Differently, for the Zooplankton Community Index (ZCI) the condition 

Excellent was not determined. Most sites were classified as Good (72.9 %) or Regular 



82 
 

(21.6 %), which could be observed in most sampled sites for both seasons (Table 7). 

The sites SG1 and SG3 were classified as Bad conditions in both wet and dry seasons, 

according to the ZCI. Both plankton indices were not sensitive to the seasonal 

variation. 

The Planktonic Index of Biotic Integrity (P-IBI) showed that most sites are in 

Excellent conditions (75 %) and the others are Good (25 %). Regular, Bad and Very Bad 

conditions were not detected. Jurumirim reservoir exhibited a higher number of 

sampled sites with "Good" conditions when compared with the others (Table 8). There 

was no remarkable difference between wet and dry season. 

Three hundred and ninety nine correlations among distinct zooplankton metrics 

and environmental variables/integrated indices were performed (Appendix IV). Some 

variables that had significant correlations with zooplankton were also evidenced in the 

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) shown in Chapter 1 (e.g. transparency, turbidity, 

inorganic and organic suspended solids, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, chlorophyll a, 

temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen). 

We selected for graphical representation a set of significant correlations (p 

&lt;0.05) (Figure 1). Conversely, although significant some correlations were not 

considered either because its amplitude of variation was not sensitive to capture 

environmental distinctiveness for the Paranapanema River reservoirs cascade (e.g. 

dissolved oxygen that also exhibits high values) (Chapter 1) or because the particular 

variable (e.g. temperature) is not directly related to water quality. 

Among rotifers the genera Brachionus sp. and Filinia sp. were correlated with 

trophic increase (water quality decrease), while the genus Collotheca sp. exhibited an 

opposite tendency. For microcrustaceans we observed that Calanoida was correlated 

with good water quality and low trophic levels as well as for Cladocerans, and the 

opposite, was observed for Cyclopoida. For lower microcrustacean taxonomic level it 

can mention the inverse relationship of T. minutus with total phosphorus and the 

inverse relationship of Daphnia with TSI mod. Toledo and positive with WQI (Figure 1 

and Appendix IV).

Discussion 

The environmental complexity of problems and the limitations of using a single 

indicator have prompted the development and application of indicators that integrate 

information across a range of attributes of environmental systems and/or different 

levels of biological organization (Thornton and Kennedy, 1999). In order achieve a 

more accurate assessment of ecosystem "health" and adjust to a multiple uses 

perspective, it is essential to conduct sensitive and robust biomonitoring programs. 

Results should provide an integrated view of the operating natural processes, as well 

as the effects of human actions and a rich variety of signals, which can be used to 



89 
 

diagnose environmental degradation (Karr, 2006; Kanne et al., 2009; Nogueira and 

Naliato, 2016). 

The application of different water quality/trophic state indices in the 

Paranapanema River reservoirs cascade exhibited different responses. For a better 

interpretation it is imperative to consider that water quality concept is not absolute; 

the terms “good” or “poor” water quality have definite meaning only in relation to the 

use of water and the assessment of the user (Parparov et al., 2010). 

For monitoring programs to select the appropriate indicators and to provide 

information that contributes for management decisions, it is critical that the 

management questions and required information be clearly articulated and 

understood (Thornton and Kennedy, 1999). In this way, the Water Quality Index (WQI) 

has been regularly used in monitoring programs and it is considered a robust and 

reliable index once it is composed of physical, chemical and biological variables 

previously established by experts to detect the quality of water for public supply 

purposes. In addition to these, it is essential to consider that when the results are 

compared to those described in a more traditional limnological studies (i.e., Chapter 

1), they are fairly adequate in describing environmental conditions.   

According to Thornton and Kennedy, (1999) limnologists have long used 

broadly defined terms to describe complex changes associated with eutrophication 

i.e., eutrophic lakes are characterized as having high nutrients and algal abundance, 

while the opposite is true for oligotrophic lakes 

Parparov et al. (2010) showed that water quality assessed with the Trophic 

State Index (TSI) is more suitable for needs of natural water resources management, if 

eutrophication is a major threat.  Contrastingly, the WQI allows accounting for several 

water resource uses and therefore it is a more robust and comprehensive tool for 

water quality quantification and thus for sustainable water resources management. 

In the last decades we have faced a discussion related to the misuse of the 

original TSI model proposed by Carlson (1977) for tropical/subtropical regions and 

regardless of the type of environment system (i.e. lakes, rivers, reservoirs, flooded 

areas). Carlson (1977) developed the Trophic State Index (TSI) for temperate lakes. It 

integrates information about nutrient (phosphorus) concentration, chlorophyll, and 

transparency (Secchi disk depth). The purpose of the trophic status index is to classify 



90 
 

water bodies into different degrees of trophy, i.e. to assess water quality changes 

related to nutrient enrichment (Zagatto et al., 1999), and a number of studies were 

carried out proposing modifications, or minor adaptations to better meet the criteria 

and purposes of this index for particular habitat/regional characteristics. 

An important consideration is that temperate and tropical/subtropical aquatic 

systems have specific sensitivities to eutrophication (Huszar et al., 2006), because they 

are exposed to different stressors magnitude concerning climatological attributes and 

land use shifts, with corresponding changes in physical, chemical and biological 

characteristics of the aquatic ecosystem (Ortiz- Jimenez et al., 2006). The prediction of 

trophic state may be more complex in tropical/subtropical freshwaters because there 

are more environmental constraints controlling nutrient dynamics and the 

phytoplankton responses in such water bodies (Cunha et al., 2013). 

According to Cunha et al., (2013) the main reason for establishing a specific 

index for tropical/subtropical regions is that the Carlson´s model only considers the 

highest productive seasons in temperate lakes (spring and summer), whilst 

tropical/subtropical systems may have high primary production through all the year 

(Calijuri and Santos, 2001). 

The TSIs comparative analyses are easier to be interpreted if one has solid 

information on the limnological structure and functioning of considered environment 

and of the methodological development of the selected models. In case of the 

Paranapanema River reservoirs cascade if we compare the limnological data presented 

in Chapter 1, with the results of the original proposal of Carlson (1977), we observed 

that this model overestimates the trophic condition - most sampling sites were 

classified as Mesotrophic or even Eutrophic and Hypereutrophic. 

The Carlson TSI models modified by, Toledo 1983 (apud Mercante and Tucci, 

1999) and by CETESB (2006) for reservoirs showed to be more appropriated for 

tropical and subtropical environments. In case of the first modified model around 70 % 

of the Paranapanema reservoirs determinations resulted in Oligotophic conditions, 

followed by Mesotrophic, 27 %. For the second it was around 60 and 30 %, for 

Oligotrophic and Mesotrophic, respectively. These results are more realistic if 

considered the low concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus and chlorophyll commonly 

found in the Paranapanema reservoirs (Chapter 1; Henry, 2014; Nogueira et al., 2006; 



91 
 

Perbiche-Neves et al., 2011; Nogueira et al., 2014l). These models were also sensitive 

to the seasonal changes, capturing the water quality decrease during the rainy season 

(higher input of sediments/nutrients). A difference to be considered between both 

models is that the first does not take into account the type of environment, such as the 

reservoir ecosystem particularities that are considered in the second. 

The TSI for tropical/subtropical reservoirs is the most recent proposed model 

(Cunha et al., 2013). It considered relevant ecological aspects for an appropriate 

assessment, including geographic positioning (tropical/subtropical region) and it was 

tested in a large number of reservoirs in the São Paulo State for validation purpose. 

The results of its application showed to be a sensitive model with most classifications 

resulting as Ultraoligotrophic (77 %) followed by Oligotrophic (17.6 %) which can be 

associated with the truly lower concentration of nutrients. Seasonality was not 

detected, as well. Similar results were obtained for WQI, but in this case, seasonality 

was better captured, resulting Excellent for 70 % of the determinations during the wet 

season and 95 % in the dry season. 

The incorporation of aquatic biota information, biomonitoring programs, 

associated with the conventional study of abiotic variables, is a strategy that 

possibilities better environmental diagnosis in order to generate concrete subsidies for 

the water resources management. Monitoring based on physical and chemical 

parameters, even including microbiological determinations, may be insufficient for a 

conclusive analysis of the diverse ecological dimensions of an aquatic system (Nogueira 

and Naliato, 2016). 

Organisms integrate time and space in a more conservative manner than 

physical and chemical variables and the incorporation of information on aquatic biota 

into water monitoring programs is a necessary strategy for alignment with the most 

advanced regulations (Nogueira and Naliato, 2016). By studying the ecological 

attributes (presence/absence, richness, abundance, dominance, equitability, 

taxonomic and functional diversity) of aquatic communities, it is possible to cover the 

wide range of environmental conditions in the watershed and their potential effects on 

the aquatic biota (CETESB, 2006; Bonada et al., 2006; Nogueira and Naliato. 2016). 

In our study, we have tried to use the available information on plankton 

communities of the Paranapanema reservoirs cascade in a water quality approach. 



92 
 

Based on the application of the Communities Indices for reservoirs (FCI and ZCI) 

proposed by CETESB (2006) we can assume that they have a good potential to 

represent water quality standards when compared to the already established WQI and 

TSI indices. The FCI resulted classified the studied sites in only two categories, Excellent 

(52 %) and Good (48 %). The ZCI resulted to be more sensitive to trophic increase, with 

73 % of the determinations as Good, 22 % as Regular and 5 % as Bad. However, it is 

important to mention that the lack of data and published results from these plankton 

indices applications, fundamental for comparison, is a difficulty that certainly can not 

be ignored. 

The Planktonic Index of Biotic (P-IBI) is a new tool for evaluation of lake 

integrity (Kane et al., 2009). The first Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) proposed by Karr et 

al. (1986) recognizes the importance of interactions among five classes of main factors 

to the aquatic biota: energy, chemical constituents, habitat structure, hydrology, and 

interactions between organisms. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency 

developed a guidance for establishing biological criteria and biologically assessing for 

lakes and reservoirs (Thornton and Kennedy, 1999). 

Chapter 4 deals specifically with the development and validation of the P-IBI 

proposal for Paranapanema River large reservoirs (Jurumirim, Chavantes and 

Capivara). The application of this index resulted in only two categories, Excellent, 75% 

of the determinations, and Good, 25 % of the determinations. This was similar to the 

FCI classifications and, as also observed for the FCI and ZCI indices, the P-IBI was not 

sensitive to seasonal changes. 

In addition to the indices application in the present work we put some effort 

trying to understand the zooplankton responses to the environmental variability, 

concerning water quality and trophic state differences. 

The zooplankton is a fundamental component of the pelagic food web in lakes, 

linking primary producers to higher consumers, and the limnological research has a 

long tradition in investigating the mechanisms that govern zooplankton diversity and 

species succession (Obertegger et al., 2007). 

The successful use of the zooplankton community as a potential bioindicator of 

environmental quality in freshwater has already been reported (Pace and Orcutt, 1981; 

Ferdous and Muktadir, 2009), especially when analyzing some ecological attributes of 



93 
 

the community (richness, abundance, dominance, diversity). The association of species 

to altered (eutrophic) or preserved (oligotrophic) environments, even for the 

Paranapanema basin, are cited in the scientific literature (Nogueira et al., 2008). 

Furthermore, Perbiche-Neves et al. (2016) studies showed that zooplankton 

abundance (generally dominated by few species) is positively correlated to high values 

of chlorophyll and nutrients (especially N and P) and negatively to conductivity and 

dissolved oxygen. Besides these general trends, individual response of each species is 

less known but would be desirable to simplify biomonitoring schemes by using a 

smaller number of species with the best response to eutrophication processes. 

The simultaneous application and comparison of distinct water quality and 

trophic state indices (WQI, TSI and TSI modifications, FCI, ZCI and P-IBI) is a new 

approach for the relatively well known, in terms of limnological features, 

Paranapanema River reservoirs cascade. Results demonstrate the potential of using 

integrated indices and plankton, mainly zooplankton, metrics as robust, as well 

sensitive, environmental indicators. For some models (e.g. FCI, ZCI, P-IBI) would be 

challenging to incorporate a higher volume of data set to confirm the identified trends, 

and perhaps establish the new protocols for achieving a better management of these 

water resources. 

Environmental indicators, when properly applied, provide valuable insight into 

complex environmental problems and can be used to effectively support the 

management-decision process (Thornton and Kennedy, 1999). However, indicators are 

based on simplifications and prudent choices must be made in data selection, 

application, and interpretation. Managers must ensure that indicators are relevant to 

management issues and target appropriate attributes of the environment.

Abstract 

Hydropower represents more than two-thirds of Brazil’s energy supply and several 

rivers have a series of dams along their course forming reservoir cascade systems, 

which create longitudinal discontinuities. The understanding of structure and 

functioning of plankton communities in reservoir ecosystems provide opportunities to 

investigate patterns of responses to cyclical variations and episodic disturbances. The 

purpose of this study is to improve the knowledge on zooplankton community 

structure of the Paranapanema River reservoir cascade, with a special focus on 

detecting patterns and species with indicative potential to evaluate environmental 

changes. The zooplankton community structure and ecological attributes were 

evaluated for eight reservoirs, Jurumirim, Chavantes, Salto Grande, Canoas II, Canoas I, 

Capivara, Taquaruçu and Rosana, considering 37 sampling sites and two seasons, wet 

and dry. To analyze zooplankton species as potential indicator of water quality and 

trophic state we considered only storage (higher water retention time) reservoirs 

(Jurimirm, Chavantes and Capivara). Zooplankton data was correlated with total 

phosphorus, chlorophyll a and with the quantitative results of Water Quality Index. 

and Trophic State Index for tropical/subtropical reservoirs. A multivariate analyses was 

also performed using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) together with 

SIMPER analyses to examine the contribution of each variable to average 

resemblances between groups. The zooplankton community was composed by 112 

taxa distributed among the main groups, Rotifera (65), Copepoda (14) and Cladocera 

(33). The potential of a set of species as biondicators was evidenced, but there was no

remarkable species replacement by tolerant forms. This could be attributed to 

inherent variety of transient conditions involving hydrological, limnological, and 

biological features, typical of reservoir ecosystems. Other point to be considered is 

that in this basin the range of trophic conditions is still not too variable. Zooplankton is 

valuable as indicators on changes in water quality and trophic conditions and can give 

us signs that the environment is undergoing changes before it’s become drastic or 

irreparable. 

Resumo 

Hidrelétricas representam mais de dois terços do suprimento de energia do Brasil e 

vários rios possuem uma série de barragens ao longo do curso formando sistemas de 

cascata de reservatórios, que criam descontinuidades longitudinais. A compreensão da 

estrutura e do funcionamento das comunidades planctônicas em ecossistemas de 

reservatórios proporciona oportunidades para investigar padrões de respostas a 

variações cíclicas e perturbações episódicas. O objetivo deste estudo é aprimorar o 

conhecimento sobre a estrutura da comunidade do zooplâncton da cascata do 

reservatório do rio Paranapanema, com foco especial na detecção de padrões e 

espécies como potencial indicador para avaliar as mudanças ambientais. A estrutura 

da comunidade zooplanctônica e atributos ecológicos foram analisados em oito 

reservatórios, Jurumirim, Chavantes, Salto Grande, Canoas II, Canoas I, Capivara, 

Taquaruçu e Rosana, considerando 37 pontos de amostragem e duas estações, seca e 

chuva. Para analisar as espécies do zooplâncton como potencial indicador de qualidade 

da água e estado trófico consideramos apenas reservatórios de acumulação (maior 

tempo de retenção de água) (Jurumirim, Chavantes e Capivara). Os dados do 

zooplâncton foram correlacionados com fósforo total, clorofila a e com os resultados 

quantitativos do Índice de Qualidade da Água e Índice de Estado Trófico para 

reservatórios tropicais/subtropicais. Realizou-se também uma análise de ordenação 

utilizando escalonamento multidimensional não-métrico (NMDS) juntamente com 

análise SIMPER para examinar a contribuição de cada variável para semelhanças 

médias entre os grupos. A comunidade zooplanctônica foi composta por 112 táxons 

distribuídos entre os principais grupos, Rotifera (65), Copepoda (14) e Cladocera (33). 

Um conjunto de espécies com potencial para bioindicador foi evidenciado, mas não 



 110 
 

houve nenhuma substituição espécies notável por formas tolerantes. Isso pode ser 

atribuído à variedade inerente de condições transitórias envolvendo características 

hidrológicas, limnológicas e biológicas, típicas dos ecossistemas de reservatórios. 

Outro ponto a ser considerado é que nessa bacia a faixa de condições tróficas ainda 

não é muito variável. O zooplâncton é valioso como indicador de mudanças na 

qualidade da água e condições tróficas e pode nos dar sinais de que o ambiente está 

passando por mudanças antes destas se tornarem drásticas ou irreparáveis.

Introduction 

The resources provided by river damming and regulation of rivers flow are 

fundamental for local and regional economies. Access to energy is a fundamental 

driver of economic growth, and during the next two decades, rivers around the world, 

including many currently free flowing rivers, are predicted to undergo development of 

hydropower plants that could double current global capacity (Opperman et al., 2015). 

Hydropower accounts for more than two-thirds of Brazil’s energy supply 

(Winemiller et al., 2015). Hydropower plants seems to be an attractive technology for 

many countries because: 1) use of low-carbon source of energy; 2) In addition to direct 

generation, support a set of energy-related services, including renewable energy, such 

as wind and solar power; 3) is relatively low-cost domestic source of power that can be 

exploited with proven technology and 4) can provide and support multiple uses, from 

storage to navigation (Opperman et al., 2015). 

In Brazil, several rivers have a series of dams along their course forming 

reservoir cascade systems (Barbosa et al., 1999; Nogueira et al., 2006). This human 

interference creates a series of alternating lotic and lentic stretches, discontinuities 

that results in longitudinal shifts of riverine characteristics (Ward and Stanford 1983). 

These shifts, which can be considered both negative (upstream) and positive 

(downstream), are also applied to the physical and chemical characteristics as well as 

the attributes of biotic communities (Kennedy 1998).  

Studies on the structure and functioning of planktonic communities in reservoir 

ecosystems provide opportunities to investigate patterns of responses to cyclical 



 111 
 

variations and episodic disturbances The understanding of plankton dynamics can be 

useful to evaluate the resilience of this kind of ecosystem too, which can present deep 

changes in limnological conditions in relatively short periods (Nogueira, 2001). 

The use of zooplankton community characteristics as a tool for bioindication 

has been considered for a long time with low informative value (Andronikova, 1996). 

However, zooplankton indices based on taxonomic composition, size distribution, 

trophic levels, spatial patterns of distribution, functional characteristics and 

quantitative data may be of high informative potential, and should not be overlooked 

in monitoring studies (Gannon and Stemberger, 1978; Andronikova, 1996; Ferdous and 

Muktadir, 2009). 

Zooplankton plays an important role in food web by linking the primary 

producers, by consuming phytoplankton, bacterioplankton and even small zooplankton 

organisms, to higher trophic levels (Ferdous and Muktadir, 2009). Zooplankton 

respond quickly to environment changes and act as an effective indicator of alterations 

in water quality, been more valuable as indicator of trophic conditions than has 

generally been considered (Gannon and Stemberger, 1978). 

The structure and dynamics of the zooplankton community result from 

interactions between fertility rates, mortality and dispersion of their populations. A 

large number of environmental variables constantly influences the zooplankton 

functional characteristics, directly and indirectly. Examples can include the effects of 

temperature, quantity and frequency of precipitation, wind episodes, nutrient 

availability, food quality and quantity, intra and interspecific competition and 

predation (Nogueira and Matsumura-Tundisi, 1996; Serafim-Júnior et al., 2005). 

Modifications in the structure and dynamics of freshwater zooplankton, which 

is represented mainly by protozoans, rotifers, cladocerans and copepods, can spread 

alterations in the trophic structure (lower and higher levels), and, therefore, are 

relevant for the entire ecosystem metabolism (Lansac-Tôha, et al., 2004). These 

organisms have a high growth rate, responding quickly to the impacts that alter the 

physical and chemical conditions of the water (Sendacz et al., 1985; Matsumura-

Tundisi, 1999; Nogueira 2001; Serafim-Júnior et al., 2003). 

In these sense, the incorporation of information on aquatic biota, including the 

zooplankton community, in biomonitoring programs associated to the conventional 



 112 
 

study of abiotic variables can be a strategy that enlarges the possibilities of diagnosis in 

order to generate concrete subsidies for an integrated management of surface water 

resources as pointed out by Nogueira and Naliato (2016). The authors also said that 

monitoring based on physical and chemical parameters, and even including direct and 

indirect microbiological determinations, may be insufficient for a conclusive diagnosis 

of the different ecological dimensions of river systems. That is because of the risk of 

reflecting only momentary condition of the evaluated water system. 

The potential use of the zooplankton community as successful water quality 

bioindicator has been reported (Pace and Orcutt, 1981; Ferdous and Muktadir, 2009). 

Especially when analyzing some communities attributes, such as richness, abundance, 

dominance and diversity, associated to other aquatic biota data, the set of information 

may contribute to a comprehensive strategic planning that must be applied at the 

basin scale, with the goal of finding balance between exploitation of hydropower 

potential and sustainability of key natural resources (Winemiller et al., 2015). 

In the Paranapanema River reservoirs, the zooplankton assemblages have been 

intensively studied, including analyses of faunal composition and diversity, effects of 

spatial compartmentalization, and seasonal cycles (e.g. Nogueira, 2001; Sampaio et al., 

2002; Nogueira et al., 2008; Sartori et al., 2009; Perbiche-Neves and Nogueira, 2010; 

Perbiche-Neves and Nogueira, 2013). The first reservoir (Jurumirim) concentrates most 

information on zooplankton distribution and dynamics (Nogueira 2001; Casanova and 

Henry 2004; Mitsuka and Henry 2002; Panarelli et al. 2003; Sartori et al. 2009). 

Sampaio et al. (2002) and Nogueira et al. (2008) also reported the zooplankton 

variation along the reservoir cascade of the Paranapanema River. 

The main goal of this study is to explore information on the structure of the 

zooplankton sampled in the Paranapanema River reservoir cascade (eight reservoirs), 

focusing on the potential of this community to evaluate changes in water quality and 

trophic level - biomonitoring purposes. 

In the analysis of the zooplankton versus water quality and trophic state using 

lower taxonomical levels (species) as potential indicators it was considered only the 

three larger storage reservoirs (Jurumirim, Chavantes and Capivara). The premise is 

that they have water retention time higher than a hundred days what make possible 



 113 
 

the development of a proper plankton community (reduced limitation by intensive 

flow). 

Study area 

The study was carried out in the Paranapanema River Reservoirs Cascade 

considering, for zooplankton community structure and ecological attributes, the same 

eight reservoirs and 37 sampling sites described in Chapter 1 (Fig. 1; Tables 1 and 2). 

Material and methods 

The zooplankton samples were collected during wet/summer (March/2011) 

and dry/spring (October/2011) seasons using a conical net (30 cm mouth diameter and 

50 ?m mesh size) for vertical hauls from near bottom (ca. 1 m) to the surface. In each 

site we collected two identical samples, one for qualitative and other for quantitative 

purpose. Samples were fixed and preserved in 4 % formaldehyde. For the quantitative 

analyses, most organisms were counted at species level. Rotifera and nauplii of 

Copepoda were counted in Sedgwick–Rafter chambers, under optic microscope Zeiss 

Standard 25 (at a magnification of × 200); and Cladocera, copepodites and adult stages 

of Copepoda were counted using a stereo microscope Zeiss Stemi SV 6 (maximum 

magnification of × 120). At least 150 specimens were counted per subsample. 

Additional sub-samples, or even the entire sample, were analyzed when the density of 

organisms was low (generally less than 100 organisms per 5 ml of sample, in case of 

Cladocera and Copepoda, and less than 100 organisms per 1 ml of sample, in case of 

Rotifera). The collected specimens are deposited in the Freshwater Invertebrate 

Collection of the Department of Zoology, Biosciences Institute (campus of Botucatu) of 

the São Paulo State University. 

The specimens of main zooplankton groups (Rotifer, Copepod and Cladocera) 

were analyzed at the lowest taxonomic level, by specialized literature. The density of 

the organisms were calculated from the volume of water filtered and the size of each 

sub sample, and expressed as numbers of individuals per cubic meter. The structure of 

the zooplankton community was determined through species composition (list of taxa 

and respective occurrence) and ecological attributes: richness, total and relative 

density, Shannon-Wienner diversity (H ') and evenness (J'). 



 114 
 

For the analysis of the zooplankton species as potential indicator, data on 

individual densities were correlated with total phosphorus, chlorophyll a and with the 

quantitative results of Water Quality Index (WQI) and Carlson Trophic State Index 

modified and for tropical and subtropical reservoirs (T.S.Is ) (Chapter 2). All data were 

previously log-transformed and significant correlations (p&amp;lt;0.05) were retained. The 

software Statistic v. 7.0 (Statsoft, 2002) was used. 

In order to evidence community similarity among trophic status levels (T.S.I. for 

tropical and subtropical reservoirs) we used a multivariate analyses - non-metric 

multidimensional scaling (NMDS) derived from a Bray–Curtis similarity matrix with log 

(X+1) transformed data. Through SIMPER analyses, we examined the contribution of 

each variable to average resemblances between groups. PRIMER v6.0 was used. 

Results 

The zooplankton community of the Paranapanema River reservoir cascade was 

composed of 112 taxa represented by Rotifera with 65 taxa (58%), Copepoda with 14 

taxa (12.5%) and Cladocera with 33 taxa (29.5%). The list of taxa, as well as the spatial 

and seasonal occurrence, is presented in Table 1. The most frequent species were 

Conochilus unicornis (88%), Collotheca spp. (81%), Euchlanis dilatata (81%) and 

Synchaeta stylata (75%) among the rotifers; Notodiaptomus henseni (100%) and N. 

iheringi (75%) among Copepoda Calanoida and Thermocyclops decipiens (100%), T. 

minutus (75%) and Microcyclops anceps (75%) among Copepoda Cyclopoida and the 

cladocerans Ceriodaphnia cornuta f. tipica (100%), Daphnia gessneri (100%), Bosmina 

hagmanni (94%), C. cornuta f. rigaudi (88%), C. silvestrii (88%), Bosmina freyi (81%), 

Diaphanosoma spinulosum (81%), D. birgei (75%) and Moina minuta (75%). 

The highest values for richness were found in JR, 59 taxa during the dry season, 

followed by JR, CH and CP in the wet season, all with 51 taxa each. Conversely, the 

lowest values were found in TQ, 21 taxa (wet) followed by CI, 24 taxa (dry), CI (wet) 

and RS (dry), both with 25 taxa each (Fig. 1). 

The total density highest values were observed in JR, CH and CP, being higher in 

JR with densities &gt; 45,000 ind. m

Conochilus unicornis, Polyarthra spp., Synchaeta spp. and Synchaeta stylata among 

rotifers; Notodiaptomus henseni (calanoid) and Thermocyclops decipiens (cyclopoid) 

among copepods and Ceriodaphnia cornuta f. rigaudi, Moina minuta, Daphnia 

gessneri, C. cornuta f. tipica, C. silvestrii and Diaphanosoma spinulosum among 

cladocerans. 

The relative abundance among the zooplankton groups are presented in Figure 

3a (wet season) and Figure 3b for dry season. During the wet season Rotifera 

predominated in the upstream portion of the river cascade – JR, CH, SG reservoirs and 

also at CIIUp site, while Copepoda predominance was observed from CIIDam towards 

downstream river. In the dry season, the dominance of Rotifera and Copepoda 

remained in the upper and lower portions of the river course, but there was an 

increase of Cladocera representation. 

The Shannon-Wienner diversity (H´) and evenness (J´) values were calculated 

per zoological group (Rotifer, Cladocera and Copepoda) and season (wet and dry). 

Rotifer highest diversity values, greater than 3 bits. ind

Significant correlations (p&amp;lt;0.05) with at least one of the selected parameters 

were found for 15 species of rotifers, 3 of copepods and 10 of cladocerans (Table 2). 

Among the rotifers, the species with the highest number of correlations were 

Brachionus mirus positively correlated with Chl a, T.S.I. (cmd) and T.S.I. (tsr); Collotheca 

spp. negatively related with T.P., T.S.I. (cmd) and T.S.I. (tsr); Dipleuchlanis spp. 

positively correlated with T.P., Chl a, T.S.I. (cmd) and T.S.I. (tsr) and Lecane lunaris 

positively correlated with Chl a, T.S.I. (cmd) and T.S.I. (tsr). Among the copepods 

Thermocyclops inversus was positive correlated with Chl a and negatively with W.Q.I. 

and among cladocerans Alona verrucosa was positively correlated with Chl a, T.S.I. 

(cmd) and T.S.I. (tsr) and Macrothrix squamosa positively correlated with T.P., Chl a, 

T.S.I. (cmd) and T.S.I. (tsr). 

The multivariate analyses of communities performed using non-metric 

multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and SIMPER analyses showed the distribution of the 

species in relation to T.S.I. (Tsr) and respective sampling sites (Fig. 5, 6 e 7). The species 

that most contributed in this analysis were: Collotheca spp., Conochilus coenobasis

Discussion 

The zooplankton community composition includes species with different 

development strategies, related to reproduction and feeding, allowing the colonization 

of environments with different physical and chemical properties (Lansac-Tôha et al., 

2003). The Paranapanema River reservoirs cascade is composed, in terms of the 

operational design and engineering concept, by two types of reservoirs: accumulation 

(storage) and run-of-river systems. The distinctiveness of reservoirs in terms of 

dimensions and functioning, accumulation and run-of-river systems, affects the 

physical and chemical limnology of these environments (see Chapter 1) and also the 

structure and dynamics of the aquatic communities (Tundisi and Matsumura-Tundisi, 

2003; Nogueira et al., 2008; Perbiche-Neves and Nogueira, 2010; Nogueira et al. 2012; 

Perbiche-Neves and Nogueira, 2013; Ferrareze et al., 2014). 

In this study the zooplankton community of Paranapanema River reservoir 

cascade was composed of 112 taxa distributed among the main groups Rotifera (65), 

Copepoda (14) and Cladocera (33). These results are similar to the ones Sampaio et al. 



 131 
 

(2002) that found by 108 taxa, Rotifera (76), Copepoda (7) and Cladocera (26). The 

similarities between both studies is also comparable in terms of the most frequent 

species. Although we found similarities in the composition and frequency, the species 

abundance and distributional patterns in each studied reservoir was quite variable 

(Sampaio et al., 2002). 

Other studies carried out in Paranapanema River reservoir cascade along the 

last two decades, considering microcrustaceans (Copepoda and/or Cladocera) in the 

series of reservoirs and/or reservoirs individually reveal a set of common species and 

similar frequency of occurrence (Panarelli et al., 2001; Nogueira, 2001; Casanova and 

Henry, 2004; Nogueira et al., 2008; Sartori et al., 2009; Perbiche-Neves and Nogueira, 

2010; Perbiche-Neves et al., 2016 and Nogueira and Naliato, 2016). This means that, in 

some way, in this reservoirs system there is a reasonably well established zooplankton 

community. 

Species composition in natural lakes lake, with a few exceptions, remains quite 

constant for many decades, perhaps even centuries (Gannon and Stemberger, 1978) 

while reservoirs represent more complex and dynamics ecosystems, because of their 

interactions with the watershed and the influx of tributaries (Straškraba, 1997; 

Straškraba and Tundisi, 1999). Therefore, while in natural lakes plankton composition, 

species richness, and abundance of organisms are dependent on various factors such 

as lake origin, trophic state, colonization processes, and presence or absence of toxic 

substances or pollutants, in reservoirs the influence of spatial and temporal 

heterogeneity on plankton richness and diversity is even higher (Matsumura-Tundisi 

and Tundisi, 2005). 

The high number of species in reservoirs and the reported variability can be 

related to distinct factors such as reservoir ageing, residence time, trophic state, 

biological interactions, water basin endemism, and even to sampling designs and the 

expertise of researchers (Matsumura-Tundisi, 1999; Rocha et al., 1999). 

In our study the group of Rotifera, with the highest number of taxa (65) and 

numerically dominant, had greater species richness in the middle to lower course of 

the river - CII, CI, CP, TQ and RS reservoirs during the dry season. Cladocera showed 

greater richness in the upper portion of the river - JR, CH and SG reservoirs in the both 

sampled seasons (wet and dry), and also in the middle course of the river - CII, CI, CP 



 132 
 

and RS in the wet season. In terms of density, Rotifera showed highest values occurring 

in practically all reservoirs of the cascade, lower than Copepoda only in SG (dry 

season), CP (wet and dry) and RS (wet season). Cladocera is a very important group in 

terms of species richness but its occurrence is always observed in low densities. 

The zooplankton community density was higher in the accumulation reservoirs 

(storage system - JR, CH and CP), as expected (Nogueira et al., 2008). The relative 

density among groups showed the predominance of rotifers in the upper course of the 

river in most sampled sites of JR, CH, SG during the wet and dry seasons. Conversely, 

the predominance of copepods was observed in the middle and lower course of the 

river - CII, CI, CP, TQ and RS. An increase of cladocerans occurred during the dry 

season. 

The diversity and evenness results have no recognized pattern of variation 

along the reservoir cascade. Probably because of the intra reservoir variability, such as 

water masses compartmentalization and tributaries influence, and their differential 

effects on different groups (Rotifera, Copepoda and Cladocera). 

Despite the great effort with the purpose of understanding the structure and 

dynamics of the zooplankton in Paranapanema River reservoir cascade (Panarelli et al., 

2001; Nogueira, 2001; Sampaio et al., 2002, Matsumura-Tundisi and Tundisi, 2003; 

2005; Casanova and Henry, 2004; Nogueira et al., 2008; Sartori et al., 2009; Perbiche-

Neves and Nogueira, 2010; Perbiche-Neves et al., 2016), there are only few analyses 

that includes the whole cascade, as a system, and all the main groups of zooplankton 

community together. 

In terms of regional zooplankton fauna, it is very important to consider the 

studies of Matsumura-Tundisi and Tundisi (2003) on the composition and distribution 

of the Calanoida species in 21 reservoirs of São Paulo State by, carried out from 1979 

onwards. Results show a considerable change in species composition. For instance, 

frequent species such as Notodiaptomus conifer in the majority of the reservoirs of the 

Middle Tietê and Paranapanema River basins disappeared completely, being 

substituted by other ones. In case of Paranapanema River probably it was replaced by 

N. henseni, currently the most frequent, widely distributed and numerically more 

abundant. According to Gannon and Stemberger, (1978), perturbations that change 



 133 
 

physicochemical milieu or alter the balance of competition can cause extermination of 

some species populations and allow the appearance of others. 

The eutrophication of freshwaters causes great changes in the structure of 

zooplankton communities and one of the main difficulties in studying loss of 

biodiversity due to eutrophication is the absence of previous records of species 

composition and/or misclassification of species, prior to eutrophication (Sampaio et 

al., 2002, Matsumura-Tundisi and Tundisi, 2003; 2005). In case of São Paulo State 

reservoirs, a pioneer typological study on 23 reservoirs during late 1970’s established a 

base line, comprising a seasonal study of their main physical, chemical and biological 

characteristics (Tundisi, 1981). 

In the composition of the zooplankton community of the Paranapanema River 

reservoirs during the late 1970’s, typical eutrophic bioindicators, such as Brachionus 

calyciflorus, rarely occurred (Sampaio et al., 2002). Changes in community structure 

are expected during the process of eutrophication (Hellawell, 1978). In case of 

Paranapanema reservoirs, the zooplankton is presently characterized by variation in 

the proportions of the different species, but without any severe species replacement 

by tolerant forms. The accumulated information based on studies carried out in more 

than three decades that clearly show the appearance, gradual and in low abundance, 

of trophic indicator species. 

The results of the correlation and NMDS/SIMPER analyses (Table 2; Fig. 5, 6 and 

7) clearly indicated the potential of using the zooplankton as biondicators in the 

Paranapanema River Basin. Nevertheless, results also indicated the need to find 

statistically more consistency relationships. Perhaps this a problem that could be 

solved if we increase our data set. In this sense, there is a good perspective through 

the use of information from the ongoing long term monitoring program of the 

Paranapanema River reservoir cascade. 

Nevertheless, we also have to take into account the fact that reservoirs are 

aquatic ecosystems subject to a set of conditions (human impacts, weather variability, 

operational engineering, etc.) which create a variety of transient situations affecting 

limnological and biological features. The reservoir steady state is frequently disturbed 

and requires some time to reestablish (Matsumura-Tundisi and Tundisi, 2003). The 

physical and chemical dynamics is intense and underlies a kind of organized chaos 



 134 
 

which the biological components survive through adaptive strategies based on the 

mechanisms of species tolerance - capability to respond either to a certain 

environmental factor or to an assemblage that act synergistically on the organisms 

(Matsumura-Tundisi and Tundisi, 2003). 

According to Naselli-Flores et al. (2003), quite a number of ecological concepts 

have been using terms such as ecological equilibrium, stability, steady-state, climax, 

stable state, etc. The term equilibrium was supposed to better depict the dynamic 

nature of a community when it is, or seems to be, persistent. Actually the persistency 

is only related to the temporal scale of the observer. The term stable state was 

proposed by Scheffer (1998) to describe the alternative stages in shallow lake 

ecosystems. The need for a clear definitions and the necessity for clarifying terms was 

openly addressed in Rojo and Álvarez-Cobelas (2003). 

Occasionally, surprisingly large shifts occur in ecosystems. Theory suggests that 

such shifts can be attributed to alternative stable states and it implies that gradual 

changes in temperature or other factors might have little effect until a threshold is 

reached at which a large shift occurs, which might be difficult to reverse (Scheffer and 

Carpenter, 2003). Even a tiny incremental change in certain conditions can trigger a 

large shift in some systems if a critical threshold known as ‘catastrophic bifurcation’ is 

passed (Kusnetsov, 1995). 

Zooplankton is a valuable as indicators of water quality and trophic conditions 

than has been under considered. It give us signs that the environment is undergoing 

changes before these changes become drastic or irreparable. More attention must also 

be given to eutrophication rate process so we can determine when natural rates are 

being accelerated by man’s activities (Gannon and Stemberger, 1978). It is important 

to reinforce that this information is critically needed for wise management of aquatic 

ecosystems and indicator organisms may be useful not only for trophic state 

assessment but to reflect minor changes in water quality as well.

P-IBI - Planktonic Index of Biotic Integrity 

TSItsr - Trophic State Index for tropical/subtropical reservoirs 

Abstract 

We developed and validated a Planktonic Index of Biotic Integrity (P-IBI) for 

subtropical reservoirs to assess their ecosystem health. We have analyzed the 

phytoplankton and zooplankton communities and determined the reservoirs’ trophic 

status in the Paranapanema River. This is one of the main tributaries of the high 

Paraná River (La Plata basin) and is the natural border between the states of Paraná 

and São Paulo, Southern Brazil. During the last half of twentieth century, eleven 

hydropower plants were constructed in the main course of the river. Three of the 

reservoirs are accumulation systems (i.e. high water retention times), whereas the 

others are run-of-river dams. For the study the three larger reservoirs (Jurumirim, 

Chavantes and Capivara) were selected. Physical, chemical and biological 

(phytoplankton and zooplankton) data were obtained in two sampling campaigns 

carried out in March (wet season) and October (dry season) of 2011. For each reservoir 

we sampled six stations, which were arranged in a gradient established between the 

lotic (Paranapanema River entrance) and lentic (dam) areas. According to the trophic 

state index for tropical/subtropical reservoirs (TSItsr), the sampling stations were 

categorized between ultraoligotrophic and mesotrophic, exhibiting low concentrations 

of phosphorus and chlorophyll. Four metrics achieved significant discrimination, in a 



139 

 

set of twenty analyzed by discriminant analysis. The individual metric scores were 

summed to provide a P-IBI score, which ranged as Mesotrophic (4-9), Oligotrophic (10-

14) and Ultraoligotrophic (15-20) and corresponded with the classification of fair, good 

and excellent, respectively. Following the longitudinal sequence, Jurumirim was 

classified as Oligotophic (qualitative category Good) and both Chavantes and Capivara 

as Ultraoligotrophyc (qualitative category Excellent). 

Resumo 

Desenvolvemos e validamos um Índice Planktônico de Integridade Biótica (P-

IBI) para reservatórios subtropicais para avaliar a “saúde” de seus ecossistemas. 

Analisamos as comunidades fitoplanctônica e zooplanctônica e determinamos o 

estado trófico dos reservatórios no rio Paranapanema. Este é um dos principais 

afluentes do Alto Rio Paraná (bacia do Prata) e é fronteira natural entre os estados do 

Paraná e São Paulo, no sul do Brasil. Durante a última metade do século XX, onze 

usinas hidrelétricas foram construídas no curso principal do rio. Três dos reservatórios 

são sistemas de acumulação (isto é, apresentam tempo de retenção de água elevado), 

enquanto que os outros são do tipo fio d´água (baixo tempo de retenção da água). 

Foram selecionados, neste estudo, os três maiores reservatórios (Jurumirim, 

Chavantes e Capivara). Os dados físicos, químicos e biológicos (fitoplâncton e 

zooplâncton) foram obtidos em duas campanhas de amostragem realizadas em março 

(estação chuvosa) e outubro (estação seca) de 2011. Para cada reservatório foram 

amostradas seis estações, disposta em um gradiente estabelecido entre a região lótica 

(entrada do Rio Paranapanema) e lêntica (barragem). De acordo com o índice de 

estado trófico para reservatórios tropicais/subtropicais (TSItsr), as estações de 

amostragem foram categorizadas entre ultraoligotróficas e mesotróficas, 

apresentando baixas concentrações de fósforo e clorofila a. Quatro métricas 

obtiveram discriminação significativa, em um conjunto de vinte analisadas por análise 

discriminante. Os escores métricos individuais foram somados para fornecer uma 

pontuação P-IBI, que variou como Mesotrófico (4-9), Oligotrófico (10-14) e 

Ultraoligotrófico (15-20) e correspondeu com a classificação de suficiente, boa e 

excelente, respectivamente. Seguindo a sequência longitudinal, Jurumirim foi 



140 

 

classificado como Oligotópico (categoria qualitativa Boa) e ambos Chavantes e 

Capivara como Ultraoligotrófico (categoria qualitativa Excelente). 

Introduction 

Brazil is a reservoir-orientated country, where most electricity production 

comes from dammed rivers. According to The World Bank (2014), 32 countries, 

including Brazil, use hydropower to produce more than 80 % of their electricity 

requirements. Further, at least 3,700 major dams, each one with a capacity of more 

than 1 MW, are either planned or under construction in countries with emerging 

economies (Zarfl et al., 2015).  

The construction of large reservoirs for hydropower generation during the last 

decades is common all over the country (about 200 dams in operation and 200 under 

construction). These human-designed environments are particularly common in the 

Southeast region, present in most rivers and have deeply changed the surrounding 

landscapes. Besides the relatively clean and renewable energy production, additional 

positive aspects related to reservoirs are the strategic water storage, flood control, 

recreation for local residents, tourism and other economic opportunities, such as 

fisheries and aquaculture (Tundisi and Matsumura-Tundisi, 2003). Among the negative 

impacts it can be mentioned the considerable changes in the rivers’ biota (Agostinho 

et al., 2008; Nogueira et al., 2008; Nogueira et al. 2010).  

Studies on reservoir limnology indicate that they constitute a particular class of 

aquatic environment due to the dynamic interaction between riverine and lacustrine 

compartments (Thornton et al., 1990; Armengol et al., 1999; Kennedy et al., 2003). 

This distinctive pattern of spatial organization has been evidenced for several large 

Brazilian reservoirs (Nogueira et al., 1999; Pinto-Coelho et al., 2006; Soares et al., 

2008; Perbiche-Neves et al., 2011). The temporal and spatial complexity is even higher 

in the case of reservoir cascades. Despite some accumulated ecological information 

(Barbosa et al., 1999; Jorcin and Nogueira, 2005a, b; Nogueira et al., 2008; Naliato et 

al., 2009; Nogueira et al., 2010; Nogueira et al., 2012; Perbiche-Neves et al., 2011; 

Matsuura et al., 2015), research efforts are still necessary to understand the 

limnological changes along the river continuum (Vannote et al., 1980), including the 



141 

 

structure and function after construction of series of dams - upstream and 

downstream transference effects (i.e. downstream exportation of low oxygenated 

water (deep located turbines), exportation of algae biomass, upstream nutrient and 

solids retention, etc. (Matsuurra et al., 2015; Portinho et al., 2016). 

Integrity of a given ecosystem can be assessed through the diagnosis of 

biological attributes or indicators, which ideally are sensitive to a range of stresses, 

able to distinguish stress-induced variation from natural variation, relevant to society 

concerns, and easy to measure and interpret. The complexity of biotic systems dictates 

that integrity assessments should incorporate a variety of indicators (including 

elements and processes) from multiple organizational levels and spatiotemporal scales 

(Angermeier and Karr, 1994). 

The Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) (Karr, 1981) is an ecologically based multi-

metric index for assessing the biological integrity of surface waters. It considered 

distinct biotic attributes, ranging from individual to ecosystem-level properties. The IBI 

was originally developed in the 1980s and used to assess fish assemblages as an 

indicator of aquatic ecosystem health (Karr, 1981; Karr et al., 1986). This tool has been 

adapted and modified in order to evaluate aquatic ecosystem health worldwide. A 

variety of organisms have been used like littoral zone plants (Rothrock et al., 2008), 

benthic macroinvertebrates (Fore et al., 1996, Li et al., 2010), aquatic insects (Silva et 

al., 2010), benthic diatom communities (Wu et al., 2012a), phytoplankton (Gómez et 

al., 2012; Wu et al., 2012b; Li et al., 2013), zooplankton (Carpenter et al., 2006) and 

combined phyto- and zooplankton (Kane et al., 2009; Kane et al., 2015). IBIs have been 

applied to different aquatic environments such as rivers (Karr, 1981; Wu et al., 2012a; 

Cassati et al., 2009; Esteves and Alexandre, 2011), estuaries (Carpenter et al., 2006; 

Gómez et al., 2012), lakes (Kane et al., 2009), reservoirs (Wu et al., 2012a) and 

reservoir cascades (Li et al., 2013) as well. 

Although IBIs have been used for many purposes, there is a unique study 

focusing on the impact of cascading dams construction, which includes metrics related 

to phytoplankton assemblages (Li et al., 2013). The index values agreed with the 

pattern of increased abundance and biomass of phytoplankton assemblages in 



142 

 

reservoir areas and provided evidence of aquatic ecosystem degradation (as compared 

with natural riverine stretches). 

All components of reservoirs functioning can be influenced in major ways by 

the dynamics of the phytoplankton and zooplankton once their abundances are 

related to nutrient/trophic status (i.e. total phosphorus and chlorophyll a 

concentrations - eutrophic-oligotrophic gradients). Therefore, phytoplankton and 

zooplankton dynamics have a large impact on aquatic ecosystem and, as a 

consequence, on humans who interact with these environments (Kane et al., 2009). 

With the purpose of effectively assessing the ecosystem health of subtropical 

reservoirs, we developed and validated a Planktonic Index of Biotic Integrity (P-IBI) for 

these systems, following Kane et al. (2009). The study is based on a reservoir cascade 

system located in Southern Brazil and includes metrics of the entire plankton 

community – phyto and zooplankton. In contrast to traditional water quality 

approaches, the P-IBI is an aggregative indicator that can not only capture aquatic 

trophic status but also identify variations in the aquatic ecosystems associated to the 

biota. The development and application of a viable Planktonic Index of Biotic Integrity 

(P-IBI) for subtropical reservoirs can be useful for management purposes – 

stakeholder’s decision processes, improvement of monitoring protocols, and 

expansion of scientific knowledge. 

Following Kane at al. (2009), our study included five goals: 1) to develop and 

implement sampling protocols; 2) to develop a multimetric Planktonic Index of Biotic 

Integrity (P-IBI) for subtropical reservoirs; 3) to validate the P-IBI for subtropical 

reservoirs statistically; 4) to apply the P-IBI for subtropical reservoirs using plankton 

selected data sets (2011 – March and October) from a Water Quality Monitoring 

Program carried out in the Paranapanema River reservoirs cascade and 5) to 

disseminate the results of the analyses to citizens and policy makers. 

Methods 

Study area and site locations 

The Paranapanema River is one of the main tributaries of the Paraná River (La 

Plata basin), located between the coordinates 22° - 26° S and 47° - 54° W, on the 



143 

 

tropical/subtropical boundary (Southeast/South Brazil). The river is the natural border 

between the states of Paraná and São Paulo (Fig. 1), with a total length of 929 km. 

Since the 1950’s, eleven hydropower plants have been constructed in the main river 

course. Three of the reservoirs are accumulation systems (i.e. with high water 

retention times), whereas the others are run-of-the-river systems. For this study the 

three larger storage (accumulation) reservoirs (Jurumirim, Chavantes and Capivara) 

were selected, based on the criteria that they are more lake like which allows 

succession of plankton assemblages. These three reservoirs have high shoreline 

development (&gt; 15), high retention time (&gt; 150 days), and are relatively deep (&gt; 30 m 

near to the dam) (Table 1). 

For each reservoir we considered six sampling stations including the main 

spatial compartments identified from previous studies (Nogueira et al., 1999; 2012), 

which are arranged in a gradient established between the lotic (Paranapanema River 

entrance) and lentic (dam) areas (Fig. 1).

Sampling methods 

Sampling campaigns for physical, chemical and biological (phytoplankton and 

zooplankton) measurements were carried out during two periods of the year, March 

2011, corresponding to the end of the wet season, and October 2011 corresponding to 

the end of the dry season – the most contrasting seasonal periods. 

Limnological analyzes and Trophic State Index calculation 

Water samples for total phosphorus and chlorophyll a analysis were collected 

with a Van Dorn bottle in three depths: surface, middle and bottom of the water 

column. Samples for total phosphorus were previously digested (Valderrama, 1981) 

and then anlyzed spectrophotometrically (Strickland and Parsons, 1960). Total 

chlorophyll a concentration was determined in replicates after vacuum filtration 

(Millipore AP40 membranes) of 1 L of water from each considered depth. For pigments 

extraction it was used cold acetone (90%) after manual maceration were used (Talling 

and Driver, 1963; Golterman et al., 1978). 

The trophic state index was determined according to Cunha et al. (2013) for 

tropical/subtropical reservoirs (TSItsr), which consider six categories: (U) 

Ultraoligotrophic (?51.1), (O) Oligotrophic (51.2 -53.1), (M) Mesotrophic (53.2-55.7), 

(E) Eutrophic (55.8-58.1), (S) Supereutrophic (58.2-59) and (H) Hypereutrophic (? 59.1). 

For both, TP and Chl a, average values among depths of each sampling station was 

used to calculate the trophic state index.

Phytoplankton and Zooplankton samples 

For phytoplankton, at each sampling station, an integrated sample was 

collected (entire water column) through vertical net hauls (20 ?m of mesh size) and 

immediately preserved in 4% formalin. The net samples were observed in an optical 

microscope (maximum magnification of 1000×) for taxonomical identification and 

determination of assemblage total richness. For phytoplankton quantitative analysis, 

three unfiltered samples were collected (van Dorn bottle) at the subsurface (ca. 0.2 m), 

middle of the water column and near to the bottom (ca. 1 m above the sediment). The 

samples were fixed and preserved with Lugol’s solution. After sedimentation, the 

organisms (cell, colony, and filament) were counted using inverted microscopy (sensu 

Utermöhl) at a magnification of 400×. At least 120 optical fields distributed in parallel 

transects were examined, and at least 150 organisms were counted per sample. The 

quantitative data were expressed as mean values for the water column. 

The zooplankton samples were collected using a conical net (30 cm mouth 

diameter and 50 ?m mesh size) and vertical hauls from near bottom (ca. 1 m) to the 

surface. In each site/campaign an additional sample for qualitative analysis was 

collected. Samples were fixed and preserved in 4 % formaldehyde. For the quantitative 

analyses, most organisms were counted at species level using sub-samples. Rotifera, 

and nauplii of Copepoda were counted in Sedgwick–Rafter chambers, by optic 

microscope Zeiss Standard 25 (at a magnification of × 200); and Cladocera, 

copepodites and adult stages of Copepoda were counted using a stereo microscope 

Zeiss Stemi SV 6 (maximum magnification of × 120). At least 150 specimens were 

counted per subsample. Additional sub-samples, or even the entire sample, were 

analyzed when the density of organisms was low (generally less than 100 organisms 

per 5 ml of sample, in case of Cladocera and Copepoda, and less than 100 organisms 

per 1 ml of sample, in case of Rotifera).

Developing a planktonic index of biotic integrity (P-IBI) for subtropical reservoirs 

Metric selection and statistical validation 

A number of plankton characteristics are directly related to the assemblage’s 

structure and composition and reflect the status of a range of environment attributes. 

It is well known from scientific studies carried on along more than a century worldwide 

that plankton features are susceptible to anthropogenic influences and can indicated 

distinct levels of eutrophication. Based on previous experience on developing the P-IBI 

(Kane et al., 2009) as well as on the accumulated regional knowledge (e.g. Nogueira et 

al., 2008; Nogueira et al., 2009; Perbiche et al., 2011; Perbiche et al., 2016) 20 

candidate metrics were considered and included in the discriminant analysis to be 

used for the multimetric index for tropical and subtropical reservoirs: total calanoid 

density; total cyclopoid density; total cladocera density; total rotifer density; total 

crustacean density; zooplankton ratio calanoid/cladocera + cyclopoid; zooplankton 

ratio calanoid/cyclopoid; zooplankton richness; zooplankton diversity; zooplankton 

equitability; total phytoplankton density; % cyanobacteria; abundance of the most 

common Cyanobacteria genera Anabaena (Dolichospermum), Aphanizomenon, and 

Microcystis; % of Anabaena (Dolichospermum), Aphanizomenon and Microcystis; 

edible phytoplankton density; inedible phytoplankton density; abundance of the 

invasive species Ceratium cf. furcoides; phytoplankton richness; phytoplankton 

diversity and phytoplankton equitability. 

Total phosphorus concentrations (µg L
-1

), and total chlorophyll a concentrations 

(µg L
-1

) were used to classify the sites trophic status (from ultraoligotrophic to 

hypereutrophyc as proposed by Cunha et al., 2013). 

Discriminant analysis (DA) was used to evaluate the ability of plankton metrics 

to distinguish among levels of degradation. DA discriminates among pre-specified 

groups of samples based on a set of variables to find gradients among groups of 

samples, then variation among groups is maximized, while within group variation is 

minimized (McGarigal et al., 2000). Discriminant analysis has been identified as an 

acceptable statistical method for the development of Indices of Biotic Integrity and can 

be used to identify variables that discriminate between levels of degradation (USEPA, 



148 

 

1998). We performed discriminant analyses (Statistica, version 7.0) to give a broad 

range of conditions in both trophic status and in the candidate metrics. All 20 metrics 

and sites were included in the discriminant analysis. 

Four out 20 metrics were selected on through the discriminant analysis. In 

order to calculate individual metric scores we constructed ‘‘boxplots’’ of the significant 

individual plankton metrics frequency distributions. We used the 95th percentile as the 

upper boundary and zero as the lower boundary (Karr et al., 1996) and trisected each 

of the final individual metrics included in the multimetric P-IBI for subtropical 

reservoirs (based on significance in the discriminant analyses) into ranges that were 

assigned a score of 1, 3, or 5 to match those values assigned to the trophic status 

condition. A 5, represented the better environmental condition (ultraoligotrophic) 

range of trisection, while a 1, was the most degraded (mesotrophic) range of the 

trisection. The statistically significant metrics for each site were summed to provide a 

P-IBI score and a classification applicable for subtropical reservoirs, in this case, 

ranging from fair to excellent, or Mesotrophic (4-9), Oligotrophic (10-14) and 

Ultraoligotrophic (15-20), respectively. 

We performed two steps to calculate the P-IBI: 1) Use cutoff scores for each 

variable to calculate individual metric values and 2) Estimate a subtropical reservoir 

mean metric score. 

P-IBI was computed through: 

 

 

 

Where: CAijk= Total Calanoid density metric score; Cyijk= Total Cyclopoid density 

metric score; PRijk= Phytoplankton richness metric score; PDijk= Phytoplankton diversity 

metric score; M = number of metrics; S = number of sites and R = number of reservoirs. 

Finally, a weighted Cohen’s Kappa statistic (k) (Cohen, 1960) was calculated in 

order to judge the accuracy of classification. Cohen’s Kappa is a statistical measure of 

the agreement of two raters or two rating methods. In our case, we compared the 

trophic status determined by TSItsr and the developed P-IBI for subtropical reservoirs. 

Significance for the weighted Cohen’s Kappa was judge ?=0.05 or hypothesis testing. A

Cohen’s Kappa of 1 indicates perfect agreement between the raters and 0 indicates 

that any agreement is totally due to chance. There is no clear-cut agreement on what 

constitutes good or poor levels of agreement, although a common set of criteria is: 

&lt;0,00 = poor, 0,00-0,20 = slight, 0,21-0,40 = fair, 0,41-0,60 = moderate, 0,61-0,80 = 

substantial, 0,81-1,00 almost perfect (Landis and Kock, 1977).

Comunication 

An important goal of IBI development is to communicate the biotic integrity 

results to a variety of different groups of stakeholders (Karr and Chu, 1997). This group 

ranges from scientists and managers to citizens and policy makers who all have a stake 

on management of lakes/reservoirs water quality. 

Further, we graphed the data as simple bar plots of P-IBI scores and also 

determined qualitative categories of the P-IBI for subtropical reservoirs that reflect the 

level of degradation scoring system (i.e., poor, fair, good, excellent) and are effective 

for summarizing reservoirs biological integrity. 

Results 

Reservoirs trophic state condition and plankton richness 

The selected Paranapanema River reservoirs exhibited low or relatively low 

concentrations of TP (varying from 3,1 µg L
-1 

in Jurumirim to 67,2 µg L
-1

 in Capivara) 

and Chl a (varying from 0,4 µg L
-1

 in Chavantes to 7,0 µg L
-1

 in Capivara) (Fig. 2). The 

observed concentrations limited the range used on developing P-IBI from 

ultraoligotrophic to mesotrophic status (Table 2), restricting the final classification 

from fair to excellent. 

The plankton community richness seems to correspond to the trophic 

conditions of the selected reservoirs. In general, phytoplankton richness ranged 

between 116 (Chavantes) and 147 species (Jurumirim) in March, and between 112 and 

137 species in October, also in Chavantes and Jurumirim, respectively. Zooplankton 

was represented by Rotifera, Cladocera and Copepod and the highest richness was 

found in Jurumirim (58 species) in October and the lowest was in Chavantes (34 

species) also in October. The total richness (number of taxa) for phytoplankton during 

the entire period was 176 in Jurumirim, 158 in Chavantes and 180 in Capivara and for 

zooplankton it was 68 in Jurumirim, 58 in Chavantes and 64 in Capivara.

The results of the P-IBI Score highlight the good water quality in the 

Paranapanema River, considering the selected reservoirs (Fig. 3-A). All of them feature 

ultraoligotrophic condition except for Jurumirim in March, which obtained oligotrophic 

condition. These results fairly represent the values obtained through the Trophic State 

Index for tropical/subtropical reservoirs as presented in Table 2. There is also a good 



153 

 

correspondence with the classification proposed by the P-IBI for subtropical reservoirs, 

with scores ranging from Good in Jurumirim reservoir and Excellent in the Chavantes 

and Capivara reservoirs. 

Figure 3 (B to D) shows the P-IBI for subtropical reservoirs for each one of the 

selected reservoirs and sampling sites. Variations between seasons and also sampled 

sites support the spatial complexity of reservoirs. The score values ranged between 

Good and Excellent in the distinct reservoirs and were higher and more homogeneous 

in Chavantes (Fig. 3-C) followed by Capivara (Fig. 3-D) and then Jurumirim (Fig. 3-B) 

with the highest spatial and temporal variation. 

When we confronted our results (P-IBI) with the TSItsr, using the Cohen´s kappa 

statistic (k = 0,067) (Table 3), there was a slight agreement (sensu Landis and Kock, 

1977).

Discussion 

Large scale reservoir construction have economic and social consequences, in 

addition to environmental impacts (Redman et al., 2004), justifying studies focusing on 

water quality and ecosystem health assessments. 

The development and application of a viable Planktonic Index of Biotic Integrity 

(P-IBI) can be useful for monitoring protocols and management purposes of the 

Paranapanema River reservoirs. These reservoirs are considered as strategic for the 

environmental policy of the State of São Paulo, the most populous and industrialized in 

the country where deterioration of inland waters resources is critical. 

The Paranapanena River has been considered as a fluvial system that preserves 

a relatively good “water quality” condition, with frequent classification of its reservoirs 

as oligotrophic or oligo-mesotrophic (Jorcin and Nogueira 2005a, b; Nogueira et al., 

2008; Jorcin and Nogueira, 2009; Nogueira et al., 2010; Henry, 2014).  

The use of plankton assemblages as integrative indexes for assessment of 

regional environmental variability is promising. Studies carried on along the 

Paranapanema River reservoir cascade have shown that phytoplankton and 

zooplankton abundances are positively associated along the cascade. It has also been 

demonstrated that their composition and structure, even in major taxonomical 

categories, can be good indicators of distinct trophic conditions in the reservoirs 

cascade (Nogueira et al., 2008, Sartori et al., 2009; Nogueira et al., 2010; Perbiche-

Neves and Nogueira 2010). 



155 

 

The determination of the trophic state index (TSI) is a traditional approach for 

evaluation of the water quality in freshwater systems. The TSI based on limnological 

variables that are relatively simple to measure, easy to calculate, and simple to 

understand and explain. In our study we adopted the regional proposal of Cunha et al. 

(2013) for tropical/subtropical reservoirs (TSItsr), which is a modified version of the 

original Carlson TSI (1997). Despite the fact that the TSIsr proposes the use of annual 

geometric mean based on 4 seasonal samplings (we have 2) and is recommended for 

lacustrine conditions (we have also sampled the upstream zones of reservoirs – river-

reservoir transition), this index allows for comparison with the P-IBI in the case 

subtropical reservoirs. Further, our sampling limitations can be overcome in the future, 

as additional data have been and will be collected under the auspices of the 

hydropower generation company. 

The following considerations helps to justify the choose of TSItsr in our study: 

(i) the trophic state criterion may help the decision making process when managing 

reservoir eutrophication and estimating the risk of phytoplankton blooms; (ii) trophic 

state criteria developed for temperate systems may overestimate the enrichment 

condition of tropical/subtropical reservoirs; (iii) comparison with previous 

investigations (e.g. Lamparelli, 2004) and with the official monitoring protocol of the 

environment agency of São Paulo State (iv) the use of the TSItsr in other studies has 

been encouraged, based on the perspective that is more representative for 

tropical/subtropical freshwaters (Cunha et al., 2013). 

The spectrum of variation resulting from the TSItsr for the selected 

Paranapanema River reservoirs was relatively low. The classification varied between 

ultraoligotrophic and mesotrophic, with the prevalence of the first condition (Table 2). 

These results are in accordance with other studies carried this watershed (see above), 

and also with the P-IBI we have developed. In our study the reservoir scores (mean 

values) were very close and comprised the categories meotrophic, oligotrophic and 

ultraoligotrophic and the reservoirs were classified either as ultraoligotrophic or 

oligotrophic (qualitative categories Excellent or Good) (Figure 3). 

The agreement between the two considered methodological approaches, TSItsr 

and the developed P-IBI, was slight (Cohen’s Kappa statistic) (Table 3). This fact is 



156 

 

probably because of the low number of samples collected in a single year. 

Nevertheless, there is a feasible possibility to enhance the P-IBI consistency in further 

analyses, as systematic monitoring of Jurumirm, Chavantes and Capivara reservoir 

continue. 

Previous to our study, the phytoplankton IBI was developed for a reservoir 

cascade in the Lancang-Mekong River, Southwest China (Li et al. 2013). The index was 

developed using phytoplankton metrics (but not zooplankton metrics) and the results 

corroborated the known longitudinal spatial pattern. Variability was mainly related to 

increasing abundance and biomass of phytoplankton assemblages in reservoir areas. 

Despite using data of only two sampling periods, it is important to consider that 

the selected periods (March and October 2011) are representative of the regional 

environmental variability, as they correspond to the most contrasting seasonal periods 

- end of summer/rainy season and end of winter/dry season, respectively. The type of 

data used to develop our P-IBI is comparable with those of Kane et al., (2009) and 

other authors who developed IBI’s (i.e. Carpenter et al., (2006), Rothrock et al., (2008), 

Cassati et al., (2009), Li et al., (2010), Silva et al., (2010), Esteves and Alexandre, (2011), 

Gómez et al., (2012), Wu et al., (2012a), Wu et al., (2012b), Ruaro et al., (2013), Li et 

al., (2013), Kane et al., (2015)). 

Multimetric indices have been criticized because they reduce data into a single 

number (Wu et al., 2012b). However, agreeing with Ruaro et al. (2013), we believe that 

an integrative and simple index may be a fast and efficient tool to monitor aquatic 

environments. The advantages of using a multimetric system over a univariate 

assessment include: (1) they measure different responses to multi-stressors occurring 

within the region of interest, since metrics represent various taxonomic and functional 

groups within the assemblages (biotic integrity) (Zalack et al., 2010); (2) they compare 

habitats both within and among regions (Barbour et al., 1999), and (3) they 

compensate for erratic responses of a few metrics, and (4) they incorporate metrics 

related to multiple ecological attributes that are valued by decision makers (Wang et 

al., 2005). 

Moreover, the ideas proposed by Karr (1981) have contributed to the 

management of water resources and biological conservation (Ruaro et al., 2013). The 



157 

 

original Karr IBI is one of the most frequently used and one of the most efficient in the 

assessment of freshwater ecosystems integrity. It allows the identification of priority 

sites for conservation (Lyons et al., 1995), integrates measurements of biological 

condition and associated resources that are easily understood by public and official 

agencies, and allows the comparison of both individual and cumulative effects of a 

variety of human activities (Karr and Chu, 2000). 

Final considerations 

This study demonstrated that the P-IBI is a potential tool for monitoring and 

management of large subtropical reservoirs, and reflects differences in ecosystem 

health over space and time. The use of metrics associated with plankton assemblages 

is appropriated, once the organisms are sensitive to environmental changes and 

integrates distinct time and space scales. 

P-IBI scores can be understood and used by nonscientists involved in the 

making, planning, and management decisions at an appropriate level for the multiple 

uses of subtropical reservoirs. This P-IBI generally agrees with previous evaluations of 

the study reservoirs and can be easily integrated into the water quality monitoring 

program of the Paranapanema River reservoir cascade.
