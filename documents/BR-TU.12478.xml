Abstract – The objective of this work was to determine the most appropriated chemical treatment to be used to
dry grapes cv. Rubi for raisin production. Drying curves for convective drying with air at 50oC, in a tray drier,
were obtained for grapes submitted to chemical pretreatments with different concentrations of potassium carbonate
and olive oil, and different dipping times, according to factorial designs. Convective drying curves were also
obtained for grapes pretreated in aqueous suspensions of soybean lecithin, at varied lecithin concentrations
and dipping times. Page model was adjusted to the experimental drying curves, and the calculated drying times
showed that the best pretreatment consisted in dipping grapes for 2 minutes in a 5% olive oil and 6% K2CO3
emulsion, at 50oC, which resulted in a drying time close to that of the pretreatment with 2.5% of olive oil, but with
a lower consumption of this substance. In addition, the immersion of grapes in an aqueous suspension of 2% soy
lecithin, at 50oC, for 5 minutes, resulted in a total drying time slightly higher than the most effective pretreatment.

Resumo – O objetivo deste trabalho foi selecionar o pré-tratamento químico mais apropriado para a secagem de
uvas cv. Rubi para a produção de passas. Foram obtidas curvas de secagem convectiva com ar a 50oC, em um
secador de bandejas, para uvas submetidas a pré-tratamentos químicos com diferentes concentrações de carbo-

ajustado às curvas de secagem experimental, e os tempos de secagem calculados mostraram que o melhor pré-
tratamento consistiu na imersão das uvas por 2 minutos, em uma emulsão de 5% de azeite de oliva e 6% de
K2CO3, a 50oC, o que resultou em tempos de secagem próximos aos do pré-tratamento com 2,5% de azeite de
oliva, mas com um menor consumo dessa substância. Além disso, a imersão das uvas em uma suspensão aquosa

Introduction

Drying grapes by sun, shade or hot air, is carried out
in many countries that produce raisins, usually employed
in breakfast cereals, dairy, bakery, confectionery, and
nutritional bars (Ramos et al., 2004). Almost all raisin
consumed in Brazil is imported, but the production of
table grapes has been increasing, and there is a great

potential to use surplus or out-of-standard fruits to
produce raisins, reducing losses of fresh fruits and
aggregating value to the product (Gabas et al., 1998).

Brazilian production of table grapes can be divided in
two major groups: the fine grapes (Vitis vinifera), mainly
represented by cultivars such as Itália and its mutations
Rubi, Benitaka and Brasil, in addition to Red Globe and
some seedless cultivars, and the rustic grapes

(Vitis labrusca), of which the most famous cultivars
are Isabel and Niagara (Almeida, 2003; Nachtigal, 2003).
Three new cultivars of seedless grapes, that are ideal
for raisin production, adapted to the tropical climate, were
recently presented (Camargo, 2003).

The waxy cuticle of grape skin controls the rate of
moisture diffusion through the berries and, in order to
accelerate drying, chemical treatments are applied to
remove or modify this cuticle and increase grape skin
permeability to water (Gabas et al., 1999; Pangavhane
et al., 1999). The first dipping mixture consisted of olive
oil and wood ash, but was substituted by an emulsion
made up of a solution of approximately 2.5% food gra-
de potassium carbonate (K2CO3) and 1.5–2.0% of
commercial “grape dipping oil” (Ponting &amp;amp; McBean,
1970). This oil is a mixture of about 70% of ethyl esters
of C16 and C18 fatty acids with free oleic acid and
emulsifiers. The composition of this emulsion has
probably been achieved by trial and error plus tradition,
along with the practice of adding K2CO3 and dipping
for 3 minutes. The active components are the esters and
the K2CO3, which also assists in emulsification by
neutralizing the free oleic acid in the oil to form soap
(Grncarevic &amp;amp; Lewis, 1976).

Bolin &amp;amp; Stafford (1981) succeeded in improving grape
drying rates with a methyl oleate:K2CO3 (1:1) mixture,
whereas increasing carbonate levels increased drying
rates. Gabas et al. (1999) found that increasing
concentration of ethyl oleate between 0 and 3%, in a
solution of 2% CaCO3, increased drying rates and
resulted in raisins with a less collapsed structure.
Different alkaline substances at different concentrations
and temperatures, with or without addition of olive oil,
were investigated by Pahlavanzadeh et al. (2001), who
obtained the shortest drying time and best quality raisins
by dipping grapes in a 5% solution of K2CO3, at 42oC.
They alerted that skin damage might result from
pretreatment with high alkaline solutions. Di Matteo
et al. (2000) proposed a physical treatment with super-
ficial abrasion of grape peel and found it to be as effective
as chemical dipping methods in reducing drying times.

Conventional chemical pretreatments are based on
the action of surfactants, present in dipping emulsions; it
would be of interest to test the effectiveness of other
surfactants. Lecithin is a GRAS (generally regarded as
safe) emulsifier composed of different phospholipids,
glycolipids, carbohydrates and triglycerides and is largely
used in foods (Fennema, 1996). Soy lecithin is a coproduct
of degumming solvent extracted of soybean oil and could

be a natural alternative surfactant to be applied in grape
drying pretreatments. For Brazilian producers, a
treatment based in soy lecithin dispersions would be
economically advantageous, since olive oil and the other
commercial “dipping oils” are imported ingredients.

Mathematical modeling of the dehydration process is
very useful in design and optimization of dryers. The
most widely used theoretical model that describes drying
kinetics of food materials is the solution of Fick’s second
law of diffusion (Nicoleti et al., 2001). Nevertheless, for
high moisture content materials such as fruits and
vegetables, this analytical solution – obtained considering
constant diffusivity and volume – is not always
applicable, since shrinkage and diffusivity as functions
of moisture content need to be taken into account. To
overcome this problem without making use of complex
numerical solutions, empirical models have been applied
and Page model is frequently used (Parti, 1998).

The objective of this work was to obtain drying cur-
ves and to compare drying rates of Rubi grapes
pretreated in potassium carbonate/olive oil mixtures and
in soy lecithin/water dispersions.

Material and Methods

Ripe, fresh grapes (Vitis vinifera) cv. Rubi were
obtained at the local market in São José do Rio Preto, SP,
Brazil. The soluble solids content was around 15.8oBrix
and moisture content around 0.84 kg water per kilogram
of wet material.

Chemical pretreatments consisted of immersing grape
berries, during a pre-determined time interval, in aqueous
suspensions of commercial olive oil and K2CO3, or in
aqueous dispersions of commercial unbleached soybean
lecithin, according to two-level factorial designs (Box
et al., 1978) with independent variables and respective
levels given in Table 1.

Solutions of the desired concentration of K2CO3 were
prepared in distilled water and heated at 50oC, on a hot
plate with magnetic stirring. Olive oil was then slowly
poured into this solution, which was kept under
continuous agitation during dipping of grapes. Aqueous
dispersion of lecithin was carried out in a similar manner,
with lecithin being directly poured into distilled water
at 50oC under stirring. The temperature of all treatments
was kept constant at 50oC.

The drying equipment was a pilot scale tray drier,
which consisted of three basic sections – an airflow
system, a drying air heating section and a drying chamber

(Figure 1). The drying compartment consisted of
four square metal trays, placed perpendicularly to the
airflow. Air was forced through an axial blower, with air
velocity being measured by means of an anemometer.
A set of electrical resistances was installed to heat the
air. A digital thermometer (Full Gauge, model Penta)
measured dry bulb temperature just before air flowing
through in drying trays. Relative humidity of the ambient
air and just of the air before flowing through in drying
chamber was measured by thermo-hygrometers (Lutron,
model HT-3004). A ‘honeycomb’ was installed before
the drying chamber to allow better distribution of air
through the product.

The berries were placed in a single layer over the
tray and inserted into the dryer cabinet, after desired
operating conditions had been achieved. The tray
containing samples was weighed at regular time intervals.
Drying runs were carried out at a constant temperature
of 50oC and air velocity of 1 m s-1. The initial moisture
content of grapes was determined gravimetrically, using
a vacuum oven (Marconi, model MA-030) at 60oC and
110 mm Hg for 48 hours. In order to determine the
equilibrium moisture content, drying runs were conducted
until changes in sample mass were less than 0.1 g.

Page model (equation 1) was fitted to experimental
drying curves by non-linear regression, using the software
Satistica v.5.0 (Statsoft, 1995):

in which, M is the dimensionless moisture, X is the
moisture content at a certain time t, X0 and Xeq are the
initial and equilibrium moisture contents, respectively, and
k and n are the Page drying coefficients, which deter-
mine the precise shape of the drying curve. While neither

of these parameters has a direct physical significance,
empirical regression equations have been developed
relating both parameters to drying conditions and raw
material moisture content (Hossain &amp;amp; Bala, 2002; Wang,
2002).

According to Parti (1998), the drying rate for the Page
model is given by:

and a modified drying coefficient could be defined as:

If n&lt;1, k* decreases during drying process. Thus,
higher values of k could be used to more closely
approximate the diffusion equation in the initial stages
of drying, without overpredicting drying in the later stages.
If n&gt;1, lower values of k might be adopted, without
subestimating the drying curve at the end of the process.

The quality of the model adjustment was evaluated
by the correlation coefficient R2, and the root mean
square of residuals, RMS (Lewicki, 2000), calculated
as:

model, and N indicates the number of experimental points
used in the regression procedure.

Results and Discussion

Drying curves for grapes, submitted to different
pretreatment emulsions at 50oC, were obtained and
compared with a drying curve determined for untreated
grapes (Figure 2). A first set of experiments was carried
out according a two-level factorial design with a central
point, varying concentrations of olive oil and K2CO3 and
keeping constant the immersion time of 30 seconds
(Table 1). The resulting drying curves showed that the
applied pretreatments were effective in accelerating the
drying process, with lower moisture contents at the same
drying time being attained by grapes treated with
a 2.5% olive oil and 6% K2CO3 emulsion (Figure 2 A).

Although the adjustment of Page model (equation 1)
to experimental drying curves resulted in correlation
coefficients higher than 0.99 (Table 2), there was a lack
of fitting in the final stage of drying, where the model
underpredicted the experimental drying curves (Figu-
re 2). Some RMS values (Table 2) were higher
than 25%, which was appointed by Lewicki (2000) as
the maximum limit for acceptance of an adjustment
model. It should be considered, however, that in the last
part of drying curves, the observed moisture contents
that should be inserted in the denominator of equation (4)
are very low, causing RMS to be increased in spite of a
good fit to the most part of the curves.

After evaluation of parameters k and n of Page
equation for each drying condition, the model was used
to estimate drying times necessary to obtain raisins with
final moisture content around 14% in wet basis (Table 2).
These calculations were carried out considering the initial
moisture content of 84% (wet basis) – that corresponds
to the average value observed in all experimental runs –
 and the equilibrium moisture content of 1.4% (wet basis)
– obtained from the average final moisture content
determined in drying runs.

The effect of olive oil and K2CO3 concentrations, with
immersion time of 30 seconds on the necessary drying
time to attain 14% moisture content (wet basis), may be
clearly observed in a surface plot (Figure 3 A). The
statistical analysis of the results indicated that only the
olive oil concentration had a significant effect at 5% level
of significance, with shorter drying times at higher olive
oil concentrations.

Based on the results of the first set of experiments, it
was concluded that an immersion time of 30 seconds
had not been enough to cause a great reduction in drying

times, which were still very long. Additional tests were
then carried out increasing immersion time of berries in

the mixture of olive oil and K2CO3, and a maximum
immersion time of 2 minutes was established (Table 1),
since longer immersion times resulted in burning of grape
skin and formation of cracks. As a consequence, the
raisins presented a sticky surface that was visually
associated to a bad product quality.

Drying curves determined to samples pretreated in
emulsions of 0.5% and 2.5% olive oil and 6% K2CO3,
with immersion for 2 minutes, were compared with those
obtained with immersion time of 30 seconds
(Figure 2 B). Also, with the objective of clearly
establishing the effect of olive oil, a drying run was
conducted after immersion of grapes in a 6% solution
of pure K2CO3. The results showed that olive oil had an
important effect in accelerating drying process, since
grapes pretreated with pure potassium carbonate
presented the highest moisture contents at the same
drying times. In addition, it was observed that increasing
immersion time in alkaline solutions, during the
pretreatment of grapes, was more effective to reduce
drying time than increasing olive oil concentrations
(Figure 3 B).

Other works have already investigated the influence
of pretreatments with olive oil and K2CO3 on drying
kinetics of grapes, however no results were obtained to
allow comparison between different concentrations of

olive oil and K2CO3 (Pangavhane et al., 1999; Vazquez
et al., 1999; Pahlavanzadeh et al., 2001; Doymaz &amp;amp; Pala,

2002; Torul &amp;amp; Pehlivan, 2004). Although most of these
works have used dipping emulsions with 0.4 or 0.5% of
olive oil, and 5 or 7% of K2CO3, there is a great
discrepancy between immersion times adopted, which
varied from 20 seconds to 5 minutes. Drying conditions
were also very different. For a pretreatment with 0.4%
olive oil in 7% K2CO3 solution, for 3 minutes at ambient
temperature, and convective drying with air at 60oC
and 0.5 m s-1, Pangavhane et al. (1999) obtained
k = 0.0615 h-1 (equation 1), which is somewhat higher
than the value of 0.0533 h-1 found in the present work
for similar pretreatment conditions. The difference could
be attributed to the longer immersion time of the
pretreatment and to the higher drying temperature used
in that work. Doymaz &amp;amp; Pala (2002) observed a
reduction of 54.2% in the drying time of grapes treated
with 5% K2CO3 plus 5% olive oil, when comparing with
drying time of grapes without pretreatment at the same
drying temperature (60oC). In this work, a similar
reduction of drying time (53.6%) was observed, when
comparing drying of grapes treated with 6% K2CO3 plus
5% olive oil, for 2 minutes, with nontreated grapes.

From the results presented above, it was possible to
conclude that, when using traditional dipping emulsions
of olive oil and potassium carbonate, the immersion time
during pretreatment assumes a preponderant role, which
could be attributed to a low reaction rate of the active
components of the emulsion, and the constituents of the
waxy layer of grape skin. During treatment with alkaline
solutions, attention should be drawn to the necessary
immersion time to increase water vapor permeability
through grape skin and the maximum immersion time to
avoid crack formation and burning of grape skin. This
would require a great degree of control during processing,
which is not always feasible in small processing plants.
An alternative of practical interest would be to avoid
the use of alkaline substances during pretreatment, which
could be possible by using soy lecithin – a natural
surfactant – in order to eliminate or modify the structure
of the grape skin waxy layer.

Drying curves obtained after pretreatments, in
dispersions of 2 and 4% of soy lecithin with immersion
times of 2 and 5 minutes (Table 1), showed that lecithin
was effective to accelerate drying process when
comparing with untreated grapes (Figure 2 C). In
addition, a surface plot of drying times as affected by
immersion time and lecithin concentration showed that,
although neither of the variables was significant at
5% level, increasing immersion time in the lecithin

suspension was more effective to reduce drying time
than increasing lecithin concentration (Figure 3 C).

Comparison of drying curves of lecithin treated grapes
with that of grapes treated with olive oil and K2CO3,
however, demands a more careful analysis. At the initial
stage of drying, moisture contents of grapes treated in
the alkaline emulsion were considerably lower than those
observed in lecithin treated grapes at the same drying
times. Nevertheless, at the end of the process, the drying
curve of grapes treated with olive oil and K2CO3 assumed
an asymptotic behavior, resulting in a very small change
of moisture content with time. At the same time, the
drying curve of grapes immersed for 5 minutes in lecithin
dispersions showed a continuous decrease in moisture
content that led to similar total drying times (Table 2).

It was observed that treatments with lecithin resulted
in the highest n values, indicating that there was not a
reduction in drying rates at low moisture contents
(Table 2). When pretreatment was carried out in the
2.5% olive oil and 6% K2CO3 emulsion for 2 minutes,
the lowest value of n was obtained, showing that with
this treatment the drying rate decreased along the
process. This behavior might be attributed to the
deposition of olive oil on grapes surface, which could be
visually detected by the oily aspect of the raisins resulted
from this treatment.

This work presented some preliminary results, that
must be further investigated, in order to determine the
best treatment conditions, as well as to investigate the
mechanism of action of lecithin on the waxy layer of
grape skin. It is also important to point out that drying
times presented in Table 2 are superestimated, since they
were calculated using Page model fittings, which showed
a weak agreement to experimental data at low moisture
contents. Also, the convective drying temperature could
be increased from 50 to 60oC, in order to accelerate
dehydration.

Conclusions

1. The most effective treatment to accelerate drying
process is an emulsion of 0.5% of olive oil and 6% of
K2CO3, at 50oC, with immersion time of 2 minutes.

2. Increasing the immersion time of grapes in the
chemical treatment reduces drying time.

3. Treatments with lecithin result in the highest
n values in Page model, whereas the treatment with

2.5% olive oil and 6% K2CO3 emulsion for 2 minutes
results in the lowest value of n.
