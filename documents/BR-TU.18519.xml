MDAC, mineralogy, geochemistry, Gulf of Cadiz, anaerobic 
oxidation of methane. 

This work is focused on the mineralogy and geochemistry of 
authigenic carbonates from the Gulf of Cadiz. It is divided in an 
introductory part where the  background concepts and the 
geological setting of the study area are presented, followed by 
the research work carried out in this master thesis project. The 
studied  samples, the methods and  the techniques applied are 
described, followed by the presentation of the main results and 
their discussion, concluding  on their mineralogical and 
geochemical characterization and significance. The  samples 
came from several mud volcanoes, on three different geological 
and tectonic settings of the Gulf of Cadiz. This mineralogical and 
geochemical characterization of the authigenic carbonates show 
the methane derived  origin, especially the C and O  isotopes, as 
resulting  from anaerobic oxidation of methane  in shallow 
sediments and permit to  divide the samples in three main group 
based  on mineralogy and morphology: chimneys, crusts and 
concretions. The data obtained compared with the  literature 
model proposed, permit to prove  the hypothesis about the 
formation processes of the three type. On the different type of 
carbonates is possible to  recognize  the influence of the MOW on 
the oxidation and bio-erosion of the  chimneys and gas hydrates 
influence on two samples from the Michael Ivanov Mud Volcano. 
It is possible, due the isotopic data, move hypothesis on age  of 
the three different type of carbonate, in particular has been 
possible to distinguish between the recent formation of the 
concretions and older formation of the chimneys.

Figure 8: Illustration of a  pockmark and underlying gas chimney during a phase of active expulsion 
of free gas. The passage of free gas through the hydrate stability zone is aided by the 
formation of hydrate around the pathways through which the gas is passing, inhibiting 
access of the gas to pore water and  preventing conversion of all  the gas to hydrate. 
Progressive formation of hydrate  and carbonate near the  seabed seals pathways, causing

Figure 9: Illustration  of a  pockmark and underlying gas chimney when only pore water is migrating 
through the system. Methane from hydrate created during the free-gas expulsion phase 
keeps the  methane in solution in the migrating pore water at saturation concentration, 
supporting chemosynthetic  biota in the pockmark, until all the hydrate is removed in solution. 
This process may continue for thousands of years, with only moderate amounts of hydrate 
and concentration of methane  in solution in the pore water entering the chimney from below.

by the initial  concentration  of methane in  solution in upwardly migrating pore water, the 
presence  of hydrate, and sulfate in the seawater. The concentration of dissolved methane in 
the rising pore water controls the depth at which hydrate begins to form. If it is less than the 
lowest value of methane solubility, then  all  previously formed  hydrate will be removed, but 
the rate ofremoval depends upon the degree to which the pore water is undersaturated and 
the rate of pore-water flow ( Foucher et. al 2007)..................................................................35

Chapter 1: Introduction

This  master thesis  project has been developed in the Geosciences department of 

the Aveiro University. Is related to three different projects:

• the ”Stratigraphic and structural control on fluid migration and related carbonate 

precipitation along conduits” project.  This  project addresses the study of modern 

and ancient carbonate conduits  and chimneys recovered in different, offshore 

and onshore geologic contexts, as  the Northern Apennines, the Adriatic Sea, the 

emerged northern part of the Crotone basin (Calabria) and the Gulf of Cadiz. The 

study aims  to constrain the nature of the authigenic carbonate samples  and to 

investigate their proposed origin as methane-derived carbonates, based on their 

similarity with other occurrences  but not yet totally confirmed. This type of 

samples  are frequently interpreted as  surface indicators  of shallow or deep 

hydrocarbons  reservoirs  and can therefore be useful for exploration purposes. 

As the leakage of fluids  up to the surface, previously needs  the achievement of 

favorable condition leading to expulsion from  source rocks, migration and 

accumulation within stratigraphic and structural traps. This  project, and this 

thesis, are developed in collaboration with the University of Bologna (Italy).

•  The Euromargins/Eurocores  programme project MVSEIS “Tectonic control, 

deep crustal structure and fluid escape pathways in the Gulf of Cadiz mud 

volcano field” started on June 2003 and integrates  Portuguese, Spanish, 

Belgium and French teams  under the coordination of the Portuguese team  (L. M. 

Pinheiro). The Portuguese work package has been founded by the Portuguese 

Science Foundation - FCT. The objective of the MVSEIS project is to investigate 

the deep crustal structure, the sedimentary section and sediment dynamics, the 

tectonic control and the detailed geometry of the fluid escape pathways in this 

area with active mud volcanism and cold seeps, using a multidisciplinary 

1



approach. The multidisciplinary approach gives  the opportunity to link the 

tectonic, sedimentological, geochemical and biological processes  associated 

with the mud volcanism and gas seepage.

• The SWIMGLO project: “The Gloria-SWIM plate boundary Faults connection and 

its importance on the propagation of tectonic deformation and deep” (PTDC/

MAR/100522/2008). The SWIM Fault system  constitutes  a 600 km  long active 

plate boundary between the Rif-Tell continental plate boundary and the Gloria 

Fault plate boundary.  Mud volcanoes, the loci of chemosynthetic biological 

communities, are found in association with the SWIM Faults. The 

interconnectivity between chemosynthetic ecosystems  in the Gulf of Cadiz can 

be mediated by local oceanographic processes. This  project will investigate the 

geological connection between the SWIM Faults and the Gloria Fault, the 

channeling of fluids along the SWIM Faults  in the deep oceanic domain and the 

chemosynthetic communities along the SWIM Faults and SWIM-Gloria 

connection. The geological, chemical and biological data will contribute to clarify 

i) the role of trans-continental-oceanic faults in the dispersal of deep-sea 

chemosynthetic organisms across  the Atlantic, ii) the fluids exhalated along this 

plate boundary and, iii) the geometry and seismicity of the connection of two 

plate boundaries that are merging into each other at Present.

The samples  analyzed in this  thesis have been collected during four different 

cruises. Three of them  are Training-Through-Research (or TTR) cruises, in 

particular the TTR-14, TTR-15 and TTR-16, that operated largely in the area. The 

fourth cruise is the METEOR cruise M86/5. 

The subject of this thesis  are Authigenic Carbonate formation, in the Gulf of Cadiz. 

In particular three type of authigenic carbonates  have been considered in this 

work: chimneys, crusts and concretion (usually associated with mud volcanoes 

structures). Those samples came from 4 different cruises list before, that operate 

in different parts of the Gulf. So have been analyzed in this  work four different data 

sets of samples colected from three different settings:

• On the Mediterranean Outflow Water channel in front of Gibraltar

• On the deep portuguese mad volcano Michael Ivanov MV

• On the Marocco margin:  Vernadesky ridge

    Pen Duick Enscarpment

    Mercator Mud Volcano 

    Merkator Mud Volcano

The main objective of this thesis  is the identification and characterization of 

authigenic carbonate associated with cold seeps from these three different 

settings in the area of the Gulf of Cadiz. In particular prove, using mineralogy and 

geochemistry, that the three types of carbonates  that have been considered in this 

thesis are actually different between them and that are clearly recognizable on the 

basis of the analysis  done. Prove also that is possible to define trends  of evolution 

and characterization for the three types of carbonate and for the samples  in each 

group. Another important objective in this master degree thesis, is  to investigate 

and try to relate the geochemical and mineralogical characteristics  to the 

formational processes of the three types  of authigenic carbonate considered in this 

thesis. After reaching all the previous  objectives, this master degree thesis 

address  itself to prove that the authigenic carbonate considered are, in all the 

cases methane derived.

The characterization of the samples  has been done using geochemical properties 

and mineralogy of the samples to identify and distinguish the different types  of 

samples. 

Based on the characterization of the carbonate samples  from  these different 

settings, the composition and formation processes  of authigenic carbonates will be 

constrained. Three types of authigenic carbonates have been considered in this 

work: chimneys, crusts  and concretions (usually associated with mud volcanoes 

and similar structures).

In this  study, the samples were characterized by petrographic and geochemical 

analysis through: 

• Thin section petrographic description

• Scanning electro microscopy analysis

• X-ray diffraction (XRD)

• Carbon and Oxygen stable isotopes

• Chemical analysis of Carbonate content and Total Organic Carbon content

Area

The Gulf of Cadiz, situated in the south-west of Europe, is a very important area of 

the Atlantic ocean. This gulf is 

confined in the North by Spain and 

Portugal southern coasts and on 

the south by Moroccan atlantic 

coasts. The most characteristic 

limits are the East and West-ones: 

they are respectively the Gibraltar 

Strait and the open Atlantic Ocean. 

This  region is  the area in which the 

water of Mediterranean sea mixes 

with water from  the Atlantic Ocean. 

T h e i m p o r t a n c e o f t h e 

oceanographic literature and marine 

geological studies  on the Gulf of Cadiz continental margin (SW Europe) emanates 

of its proximity to the Strait of Gibraltar, a point of singular geographic interest, 

being it the place where the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea interchange 

their water masses, starting a thermodynamical system that is  one of the most 

important in the global water circulation, and where the Western Mediterranean 

Alpidic Orogen (Betic and Rif Mountain range) meet through the Gibraltar Tectonic 

Arch. Therefore, this zone has  been object of numerous studies  in a large variety 

of disciplines.

Geologically speaking, the Gulf of Cadiz is located at the front of the Betic-Rifian 

Arc. It has  had a very complex geological history and undergone several episodes 

of rifting, compression and strike-slip motion, since the Triassic (Wilson et al., 

1996; Maldonado et al., 1999). The westward migration of the Gibraltar arc during 

the Mesozoic caused the Gulf of Cadiz to form as a forearc basin (Maldonado et 

al., 1999). In the forearc basin, due to different movement, rotation and 

gravitational processes resulted in the implantation of the Gibraltar Olistostrome. 

This  is  a chaotic consequence of units  that involve a huge volume of mud and salt

diapirism of Triassic salt units  and undercompacted Early-Middle Miocene plastic 

marls (Maldonado et al. 1999).

Throughout this area, pockmarks, extensive mud volcanism, carbonate mounds 

and chimney structures related to hydrocarbon rich fluid venting and mud diapirism 

are observed (Ivanov et al., 2000; Somoza et al., 2003; Pinheiro et al., 2003). 

At the East part of the Gulf of Cadiz it is possible to observe a large NE-SW 

diapiric ridge, the Guadalquivir Diapiric Ridge (GDR), that runs from  the shelf 

break up to 1200 m  water depth. This ridge controls  the orientation of the main 

channel of the Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW) undercurrent. The GDR is 

comprises  a series  of wide sub-circular conical mounds surrounded by ring-

shaped seafloor depressions. Most of these depressions are filled by contourite 

deposits  as  results  of the MOW undercurrent interaction with the seafloor. Some of 

them, mainly on the right side of the main MOW channel, are developed into 

sediment “shadows”, formed on the down-current side of the mounds  and with 

asymmetrical moats (Kenson et al., 2006 ).

Thesis Outline

the main the formation process, environments and the mineralogy of this  kind of 

rocks. 

Then I’ll review the Authigenic Carbonates: those are exactly the type of carbonate 

rocks  studied in this  thesis. Is  possible to identify different types  of Authigenic 

carbonates and especially Methane Derived Authigenic Carbonate. Those are

be described the formation and main geology of the gulf because it is  important to 

discriminate the composition of the samples and of the rock in the area. Also there 

is  the description of the actual setting of the ocean currents  and this is very 

important to understand the influence of the MOW that enter in the gulf and 

processes and interaction water-sediment.

Chapter 2: Theoretical Background

2.1 Carbonate Rocks

Sedimentary carbonates  are very important, they cover about 7% of the earth 

surface and correspond to 10-15% of the total sedimentary rocks (Morse et al., 

1990). 

The economic importance of this type of sedimentary rocks is  close related with 

the hydrocarbons  industry. In fact more than 50% of the oil and gas reservoirs   are 

related with carbonate reservoirs. Because carbonate minerals  generally are 

soluble in slightly acidic waters, they often have high porosity and permeability, 

making them ideal reservoirs for petroleum.

Also a large part of carbon on earth is stored in carbonate sediments and therefore 

carbonates play a major role in the global carbon cycle (Lein, 2004).

carbonates are of interest not only to the oil industry they have also economic 

importance as  industrial "mineral" resource to the agriculture, as natural stone, 

and to the cement and concrete composites  industry. Two main types  of carbonate 

rocks can be considered:

-Limestones, composed mostly of calcite (CaCO3) or high Mg calcite [(Ca,Mg)
CO3]; 
-Dolostones, composed mostly of dolomite [CaMg(CO3)2].

2.1.1 Mineralogy

Carbonate rocks contain a variety of minerals. Calcite and dolomite are the most 

abundant, aragonite is  rarer, and other carbonate minerals, such as  [ankerite, …] 

are largely considered has result of special deposits and called “trace minerals”.

Is appropriate to divide carbonate minerals  by the environments in which they are 

deposited, in fact the factors  controlling the source, mineralogy and diagenesis are 

very different in deep, intermediate and shallow water.

The main characteristics  of those minerals  and will be discussed now and 

subsequently the environmental differences between the different carbonates.

CaCO3 minerals: Is possible to distinguish between three polymorphs of this 

composition. Calcite (rhombohedral mineral) is  the most abundant carbonate 

8



mineral and is the most stable thermodynamically. Aragonite (orthorhombic 

mineral) is 1,5 times more soluble than calcite. Viterite, of hexagonal structure, has 

been rarely observed in natural systems  and always  in condition in which it is 

metastable relative to calcite and aragonite. Viterite is  3,7 times more soluble than 

calcite and 2,5 than aragonite (Morse et al., 1990).

Dolomite: is one of the most abundant sedimentary carbonate minerals. Its 

formation remains controversial because of the complex and well-ordered 

structure and because of the many different types  of dolomites  that exist. There is 

a deep relation of stability between dolomite and calcite, in fact in different 

environment the two minerals exchange in percentage of Ca and Mg to increase 

their stability. In marine waters mostly, but also in others, dolomite is the stable 

carbonate phase.

High temperature dolomite, it happen dolomization process. it is the process by 

which limestone is  altered into dolomite; when limestone comes into contact with 

magnesium-rich water, the mineral dolomite, calcium and magnesium  carbonate, 

CaMg(CO3)2, replaces  the calcite in the rock, volume for volume. Dolomitization 

involves recrystallization on a large scale.

Low temperature dolomite give problem in formation, in the water, and can be 

substitute by aragonite (Morse et al., 1990).

Other carbonate phases: The carbonates tends to form  a variety of hydrates. 

Magnesite, for example, cannot form directly from liquid to solid in surface 

condition, but a variety of magnesium carbonate hydrates form from solution. 

The possible substitution in the carbonate mineral general structure between the 

calcium  or magnesium  and iron or manganese produce a very large number of 

mineral compositions and structures (Morse et al., 1990). 

2.1.2 Classification of carbonate rocks

There are two main classifications that can be used to classify carbonates rocks.

Folk Classification

The Folk classification divides  carbonates into two groups. Allochemical rocks  are 

those that contain grains  brought in from elsewhere (i.e. similar to detrital grains in 

9



clastic rocks). Allochemical rocks have grains  that may consist of fossiliferous 

material, ooids, peloids, or intraclasts. These are embedded in a matrix consisting 

of microcrystalline carbonate (calcite or dolomite), called micrite when cement 

crystals  are less than 5 microns, or larger visible crystals of carbonate, called 

sparite. Sparite is  clear granular carbonate that has formed through 

recrystallization of micrite, or by crystallization within previously existing void 

spaces during diagenesis. Orthochemical rocks  are those in which the carbonate 

crystallized in place (Morse et al., 1990).

Dunham Classification.

The Dunham  classification is based on the concept of grain support. Also this 

classification divides carbonate rocks into two groups, those whose original 

components were not bound together during deposition and those whose original 

components formed in place and consist of intergrowths of skeletal material. The 

latter groups  are also called boundstones. The former group is  further subdivided 

as  to whether or not the grains are mud-supported or grain supported. If the rock 

Figure 2: Folk classification of carbonates rocks. (Souce: Folk, 1965)

10



consists of less  than 10% grains it is called a mudstone. If it is mud supported with 

greater than 10% grains it is called a wackstone. If the rock is grain supported, it is 

called a packstone, if the grains  have shapes that allow for small amounts  of mud 

to occur in the interstices, and a grainstone if there is  no mud between the grains 

(Morse et al., 1990).

2.1.3 Carbonate Precipitation

Carbonate precipitation in the marine environment occurs by abiotic and biotic 

processes  and is  possible to estimate the degree of biotic influence on the 

precipitation process using this three stages: 

a) Abiotic precipitation is controlled by the thermodynamic saturation state and 

the reaction kinetics of the aqueous  solution; the influence of organisms is 

insignificant.

b) Biologically induced precipitation or mineralization occurs as  a byproduct of 

an organism’s metabolic activity or through its interactions  with the surrounding 

environment. The organism  is a causative agent only, without control over 

mineral type or habit, and therefore the minerals  resulting from this  precipitation 

differ little from their inorganic counterparts.

c) Biologically controlled precipitation is a process where composition and form 

Figure 3: Dunham classification of carbonates rocks. (souce: Dunham, 1961)

11



of the mineral as  well as  onset and termination of precipitation are determined 

by organisms. The mineralization is  completely regulated, allowing the organism 

to precipitate minerals  that serve some physiological purpose. The organism 

uses cellular activities  to direct the nucleation, growth, morphology and final 

location of the mineral that is  deposited. All the biologically controlled 

mineralization processes  occur in an isolated environment, that can be 

extracellularly, intercellularly or intracellularly. 

Only three modes of carbonate precipitation are significant: the skeletal mode of 

precipitation (largely of the biotically controlled type), the microbial mode 

(predominantly biotically induced) and the abiotic mode (Tuker et al.,1990).

2.1.4 Skeletal mode of biologically controlled precipitation

The majority of carbonate material in modern oceans  are  composed by skeletons 

of organisms. The formation and the deposition of these skeletons  are influenced 

by various  environmental factors, and function of the type of metabolism  employed 

in the formation of skeleton. Is possible to distinguish two main type of 

metabolism: autotrophy and heterotrophy. Autotrophic organisms use inorganic 

materials  to synthesize organic matter useful to the organism. The heterotrophic 

organisms use organic material to synthesize the organic matter useful to the 

organism. Among the carbonate producers , autotrophic organisms are all photo-

autotrophic: they perform photosynthesis  to live so they strongly depend on light 

and temperature to survive. Note that the metabolism  of extinct groups can only be 

deduced from circumstantial evidence (Schlager W., 1992).

2.1.5 Microbial mode of biogenic induced precipitation

Shallow water carbonates  into skeletal material and abiotic precipitates is 

inadequate.  A significant part of the non-skeletal carbonate material seems  to 

have been precipitated under the influence of organisms  and so isn’t possible to 

classify them  as  abiotic. The precipitation is  predominantly induced by micro-

organisms, mostly bacteria. Micrite is, usually, the dominant component of these 

deposits. Often to refer to this  rock is  used the term “automicrite”, it stands  for 

autochthonous  micrite as  opposed to allochthonous  micrite that was transported 

and deposited as  fine-grained sediment.  Microbial precipitates may form in the 

12



photic zone or below it, up to water depths of about 400 meters. On modern reefs, 

the microbial deposits are best developed in the forereef zones (Schlager W., 

1992).

2.1.6 Abiotic mode of precipitation

In this  category is included all the carbonate material that was precipitated from 

sea water during early diagenesis  within the depositional setting. Depositional 

setting implies  that the pore waters  were very similar to sea water in composition. 

The products of abiotic precipitation are found in close association with those of 

the skeletal and the automicrite factory (Schlager W., 1992).

2.1.7 Carbonate Depositional Environments

The major part of the modern, and probably most ancient, carbonates  are 

predominantly deposed shallow water depths (&lt;10-20 m). This  occurs because the 

organisms involved into the carbonate deposition cycle, as explained before, are 

mostly photosynthetic. This  implies  that they need the sun light to survive and to 

give origin to the reactions involved in carbonate formation. Furthermore, is 

important to consider also that the carbonate deposition generally occurs in 

environments where there is  a lack of siliciclastic input into the basin. This input 

increases the turbidity of the water reducing the irradiance and the penetration of 

the light. In addition, silicate minerals  are mechanically harder than the carbonate 

minerals and so may mechanically abrade the carbonates. High carbonate 

deposition also requires  relatively warm waters  conditions that also increase the 

abundance of carbonate secreting organisms and decrease the solubility of 

13

Figure 4: Carbonate depositional environments. (Schlager W., 1992)



calcium  carbonate in seawater. Nevertheless, carbonate rocks form, with the right 

conditions, also in deep water and in colder environments (Schlager W., 2002). 

2.1.7.1 Main carbonate depositional environments

Carbonate Platforms and Shelves: Are warm shallow seas, generally in continental 

margins  that are ideal places for carbonate deposition. Carbonate shelves  can 

also occur surrounding oceanic islands after volcanism  has stopped and the island 

to eroded. Carbonate platforms  are buildups  of carbonate rocks  in the deeper 

parts  of the oceans on top of continental blocks left behind during extensional 

processes mostly (Schlager W., 1992). 

Tidal Flats. Tidal flats  are areas that flood during high tides and are exposed 

during low tides. Carbonate sands carried in by the tides  are cemented together by 

carbonate secreting organisms, forming algal mats  and stromatolites  (Schlager W., 

1992).

Deep Ocean. Carbonate deposition can also occur in the deep ocean, but only at 

depths above the Carbonate Compensation Depth, by the accumulation of  pelagic 

carbonate shells of  pelagic organisms  and of benthic organisms. The location of 

the Carbonate Compensation Depth is  largely dependent on latitude - deeper near 

the equator and shallower nearer the poles, but is  usually located between 3,000 

and 5,000 m  water depth. The Carbonate Compensation Depth is the depth at 

which more than 80% of the initial sediment carbonate content, sinking from  the 

surface, is dissolved. Whenever the seawater CO32- concentration is  higher than 

the correspondent carbonate mineral saturation value, the carbonate mineral is 

stable and will not dissolve, but once water CO32- concentration becomes lower 

than the correspondent mineral saturation curve the mineral starts  to dissolve. As 

the carbonate saturation equilibrium increases with depth due to increase in 

pressure (as dissolved calcium and carbonate ions  occupy less volume than as 

combined in solid form).  The main type of carbonate deposition in the deep 

oceans  consists  of the accumulation of the remains of planktonic foraminifera to 

form  a carbonate ooze. This ooze are buried and suffer a diagenetic 

recrystallization to form  micritic limestones. Since most oceanic ridges  are at a 

depth shallower than the Carbonate Compensation Depth, carbonate oozes  can 

14



accumulate on the flanks  of the ridges  and can be buried as the oceanic crust 

moves away from  the ridge, but also most oceanic crust and overlying sediment 

are eventually subducted so the preservation of such deep sea carbonates  in the 

geologic record is rare (Schlager W., 2002).

Non-marine Lakes. Carbonate deposition can occur in non-marine lakes  as a 

result of evaporation, in this  case the carbonates are associated to other 

evaporites deposits. In this  kind of environment there is  a big consumption of CO2 

by organisms, so the water become oversaturated with respect to calcite (Schlager 

W., 2002).

Hot Springs. When hot water saturated with calcium carbonate reaches  the 

surface of the Earth at hot springs, the water evaporates  and cools  resulting in the 

precipitation of calcite to form a type of limestone called travertine. 

(Schlager W., 2002)

2.2 Authigenic Carbonates

The term  “authigenic” indicates  the in situ formation of a mineral. It comes from 

greek and literally the meaning is “born in the same place”. The minerals  that form 

those rocks are characterized by the formation in place from  the interstitial pores. 

Authigenic carbonates are, in general, formed by evaporitic deposition or by 

chemical precipitation of marine and non-marine water in loco.

Oceanic authigenic carbonates  are classified according to the origin of carbonate 

carbon source, evaluated through several methods  of sedimentary petrography, 

mineralogy, isotope geochemistry, and microbiology. 

Mg-calcite, proto-dolomite and aragonite predominate among the authigenic 

carbonates. Their formation is  a biogeochemical (microbial) process that involves 

carbon from ancient sedimentary rocks, abiogenic methane and bicarbonate-ion of 

hydrothermal fluids  into the modern carbon cycle. This  process is  a very important 

and powerful in the balance of the carbon  cycle, in fact it removes  annually about 

1 Gt of CaCO3 from  seawater (Lisitsyn, 1978). This process is  also very important 

and focus of intense study due to importance in the equilibrium of the CO2 balance 

16

Table 1: Main regions of authigenic carbonate investigation. ( Lein, 2004)



between lithosphere, ocean and atmosphere. It is  also important in the Ca balance 

regulation.

The time necessary for the formation of authigenic carbonates and the 

mechanisms of their formation were unknown for a long time. The first important 

study on authigenic carbonates  were made by Stakhov (1951) that studied the 

formation mechanisms  of diagenetic carbonates in Black Sea sediments. He 

believed that “CO2 generated during diagenetic decay of buried organic matter 

would play an important role in the migration and redistribution of carbonates 

fraction in sediments. Stakhov (1951) showed that the content of CO2 generated 

during diagenesis, the amount of carbonate dissolved in pore solution, and the 

redistribution and concentration of carbonates in the form of local segregations 

have a direct correlation with the organic matter content (Strakhov, 1962, p. 545). 

However, Strakhov denied the role of bacteria in calcium  precipitation. He believed 

that “bacterial calcite formation” is  insignificant, whereas  chemical precipitation of 

CaCO3 and its transport in suspended form are a dominant process” (Strakhov, 

17

ferent reservoirs involved in hydrothermal  systems at mid-ocean ridge environments. (a) Lost City-
type hydrothermal  system (b) Black smoker type  system. Abbreviations: DOC, dissolved organic 
carbon; DIC, dissolved inorganic carbon; TOC, total  organic carbon; TIC, total inorganic carbon; 
TC, total carbon (Delacour et al., 2008)



1962, p. 102).

After the 1960s the interest about authigenic carbonate formation processes 

increase with the discover of the methane-derived authigenic carbonates  (MDAC) 

that are related to methane oxidation in the oceanic sediments (Niemann et.al, 

1984). In 1984 methane seeps were discovered.These seepage sites  correspond 

to the discharge of methane-bearing solutions  and gas  jets  from bottom 

sediments. These structures produced a new attention on the authigenic 

carbonates (Suess et al., 1985). This  type of authigenic carbonates  is  marked by 

the presence and development of unique biological communities  (Sibuet and Olu, 

1998) and by the large variability of their morphologies, including carbonate 

buildups (“chimneys” or “reefs”), plates, crusts, and so on (Lein, 2004).

Since the 1970’s  and 80’s, a large number of active hydrothermal fields have been 

discovered, especially in the mid-ocean ridges. Those are characterized by the 

discharge of endogenic gases, like CH4 and CO2, and by the formation of 

authigenic carbonates  minerals, that depending from  the cases  can be formed 

stockworks or as chimneys and buildups  at hydrothermal vents  associated with 

off-axis and serpentinization vents  (Lein, 2004). An example of this last possibility 

is  the Lost City field, discovered in 2001. This is a hydrothermal field characterized 

by low-temperature fluids venting at the seafloor, that is also characterized by 

about 30 columnar carbonate buildups, up to 10 m  across and 60 m  high. It was 

located at the intersection of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge with a transform  fault in the 

North Atlantic 30° N area (Kelley et al., 2001; Lein et al., 2002a). This vent system 

is  located in an off-axis  setting where serpentinization of lower oceanic crust and 

upper mantle peridotite produces  large amount of methane and hydrogen released 

into the surrounding water; they do not produce significant amounts  of carbon 

dioxide, hydrogen sulfide or metals, which are the major outputs  of volcanic black 

smoker vents, in figure 5 is possible to see at the differences between a typical 

black smoker vent and the Lost City vent. All the methane and hydrogen rich fluid 

escape as volatiles sustain dense microbial communities, which include 

methanogenic and/or methanotrophic Archaea, methane-oxidizing bacteria, and 

sulfur-oxidizing and sulfate-reducing bacteria (Delacour et al., 2008).

Since 1975, occurrences and processes of authigenic carbonate formation in 

18



sediments  of the modern ocean had been investigated (see figure 6 and table 1). 

As shown in table 1, the authigenic carbonates  are formed at different water 

depths, from shallow settings with just a few meters  up to the deep ocean with 

water depths  of more than 4500 m, and in different environments, from tropical 

zones to the polar-ones (Lein, 2004). 

Their formation is a major process of interaction of organic and inorganic carbon 

cycles with the calcium cycleThe inorganic and the organic carbon cycles  are 

connected by CO2 assimilation (photosynthesis  and chemosynthesis) and CO2 

extraction. It means  that the Ca cycle governs via carbonates  formation acidic-

alkaline and redox conditions of the biosphere, particularly in the ocean.

Each type of carbonate described by Lein (2004) has  particular formation 

conditions and characteristics.

The formation conditions  of the type I authigenic carbonates (Lein, 2004) 

include high content of labile Corg and enhanced heterotrophic microbial 

activity in the sediments. In this type, the organic matter decays  in the 

sediments  resulting in the precipitation of carbonates, that are depleted in 

heavy carbon isotope 13C (up to 10-15per mil), relative to the normal marine 

carbonates produced by the input of seawater CO2 that inherited the 

isotopic composition of the primary Corg. The !18O value in the carbonates 

depends mainly on the oxygen isotopic composition of the bicarbonate ion 

in the pore water or seawater and less  on the water temperature. Mg-calcite 

predominates in carbonates of this type.

• Lein (2004) Type II: Methane Derived Authigenic Carbonate (MDAC)

Type II is  formed as  result of the migration of methane, of various  origins, which 

his oxidation under anaerobic conditions  induces  the formation of carbonates. This 

type II corresponds  to the so-called methane-derived authigenic carbonates 

(MDAC) (Lein, 2004). All the samples studied in this thesis belong of this type.

Methane seeps are related to specific tectonic and geomorphological processes  of 

larger scale in the marine setting. Lein (2004) divide the formation processes of 

methane seeps authigenic carbonate on the following types  and subtypes 

according to the source of the seepage methane: (IIa) diagenetic methane seeps; 

(IIb) thermogenic methane seeps; (IIc) the same as  IIb, but with an assumed 

contribution of hydrothermal methane to the fluid (in the Gulf of Cadiz some 

studies suggest this case (Hensen et al., 2007; Scholz, F. et al., 2009) .

The methane seeps studied until now show that methane may be oxidized in both 

aerobic and anaerobic conditions, but the microbial activity is  obligatory for 

methane oxidation in both situations. The group of the so-called methanotrophs 

microbes participate in the aerobic oxidation.

The mechanism of anaerobic methane oxidation and the role of different 

physiological groups  of anaerobic microorganisms  in this process  are actively 

discussed since the first publications by Zehnder and Brock (1979, 1980). Based 

on laboratory experiments  with pure methanogene cultures  these authors 

demonstrated that if substrates (CO2, H2) are exhausted and the methane content 

20



is  high, methanogenes  start to perform  anaerobic methane oxidation, according to 

the reaction:

(1)                                    CH4 + 2H2O ! CO2 + 4H2

Since this  process proceeds  very slowly in pure cultures  because of the hydrogen 

accumulation it is assumed (Reeburgh and Alperin, 1988; Valentine and 

Reeburgh, 2000) that the reaction (1) occurs  in simultaneous  with the sulfate-

reduction reaction (2):

(2)                                        4H2 + SO 4 2-+ H+ ! HS -+ 4H2O

In natural anaerobic ecosystems this implies the involvement of sulfate-reducing 

bacteria (Reeburgh and Alperin, 1988; Valentine and Reeburgh, 2000). The formal 

summation of Equations (1) and (2) results in the net mechanism  of sulfate-

dependent methane oxidation (SDMO):

(3)                              CH4 + SO 4 2- ! HCO3 - + HS - + H2O

The hypothesis of direct methane oxidation by sulfate-reducing bacteria has been 

already proposed before (Barnes et al., 1976; Reebourgh, 1976; Reebourgh and 

Heggie, 1977). Microscopic study of bacterial mat samples  from the surface of 

carbonate buildups  and inoculation on elective nutrient media revealed abundant 

and diverse microflora, including sulfate reducers, aerobic methanotrophs, and 

large filamentous microorganisms  morphologically similar to methanogenes 

(Pimenov et al., 1997). Results  of molecular-biological studies, which revealed 

typical archaen bacterial biomarkers, also indicate the presence of methanogenes 

in these bacterial mats (Pimenov et al., 1997; Turova et al., 2002). 

Lein (2004) used oxygen isotopes of authigenic carbonates  to describe the nature 

of ultimate electron acceptor involved in the anaerobic methane oxidation. The 

"18O values  of carbonates  substantially differ from the "18O values  of seawater 

and the sulfate dissolved therein, thus  eliminating their participation as  oxygen 

donors in the anaerobic methane oxidation according to Equations (1) and (3).

According to Valentine and Reeburgh (2000), such reactions proceed through 

methane oxidation to acetate and water, equation 4.

(4)     CH4+HCO3 -! CH3COO- + H2O

 resulting in the acetoclastic methanogens  activity, with the subsequent 

21



participation of sulfate-reducing bacteria and anaerobic oxidation of acetate, 

resulting in the net Equation 5:

(5)              CH3OO- + SO2-4 ! 2HCO3- + HS-

(6)                               CH4 + SO2-4 ! 2HCO3- + HS- + H2O

Equation 6, is  the sum of reactions  4 and 5, mediated by methanogenes and 

sulfate reducers, as similar to the SDMO reaction 3. However, the oxygen source 

(HCO3 -) and the intermediate oxidation product (CH3OO-) are substantially 

different. Lein asserts that the contribution of marine bicarbonate with a rather 

heavy carbon isotopic composition ("13C = –2.1‰ VPDB) may explain the above 

considerable difference in "13C values  between carbonates and organic carbon of 

authigenic carbonate buildups. The carbon isotopic composition of carbonate 

buildups  is a mixture of isotopically light carbon formed during the methane 

oxidation and isotopically heavy bicarbonate carbon of seawater. Thus, anaerobic 

oxidation is mediated by a microbial consortium mainly including methanogene 

archae and sulfate reducers. According to the modern classification, a part of the 

sulfate reducers  belongs to archae rather than to the bacteria Phylogenetic 

Domain (Michaelis et al., 2002; Pimenov et al., 1998).

• Lein (2004) Type III: Microbial oxidation of hydrothermal methane

Lein (2004) authigenic carbonate type III is  characterized by the discharging 

onto the bottom  surface as  any other methane undergoes the microbial 

oxidation to form  carbonate crusts. Carbon isotope of authigenic carbonates 

inherited from the hydrothermal methane is a geochemical evidence of the 

carbonate origin.

• Lein (2004) Type IV: Mixing of hydrothermal fluid with seawater

Lein (2004) authigenic carbonates  of type IV are characterized by having 

seawater bicarbonate as the carbon and oxygen source for these 

carbonates, whereas  calcium and partially strontium  are derived from 

22



hydrothermal sources. Carbonates of this  recently discovered type are also 

related to microbial activity. A complicated microbial consortium 

impregnates the carbonate buildups and maintains the reduced (Eh = –120 

mV) alkaline (pH = 9.0–9.9) environment in the hydrothermal fluid, which 

promotes the precipitation of carbonates. Microorganisms (more precisely, 

prokaryotes) with a specific calcite-forming function have not been found in 

nature up to date. However, it is  these microbial communities  that increase 

the pH value of seawater and create favorable conditions  for calcium 

carbonate precipitation.

Carbon in authigenic carbonates of types  I and II is  depleted in the heavier isotope 
13C (!13C values  vary from –15 to "50‰ (VPDB)). Unlike the carbonates  founs 

associated with mud (volcanoes) that have positive !18O values varying from  1.0 

to 5.4‰ (VPDB), the authigenic carbonates  of types  I and II are characterized by 

negative !18O values ranging from  –5.1 to "9.8‰ (VPDB). Microbial communities 

occur in all types  of authigenic carbonates considered by Lein (2004). Various 

carbon sources  can be considered: Organic matter, methane, bicarbonate ion of 

seawater and/or pore water, and even inorganic carbon compounds of 

hydrothermal solutions. The authigenic carbonate formation is a combination of 

biogeochemical (microbial) processes  that ensure the interaction of calcium, 

organic carbon, and inorganic carbon cycles. In conclusion, as proposed by Lein 

(2004),  the authigenic carbonates carbon sources  can be divided in four major 

types: (I) organic carbon of bottom  sediments; (II)  methane carbon, including (IIa) 

diagenetic, (IIb) thermogenic, and (IIC) thermogenic + hydrothermal subtypes; (III) 

hydrothermal methane carbon; and (IV) carbon of # HCO3 - in seawater and 

hydrothermal fluids. Authigenic carbonates  of types  I and II are the most 

widespread in the marine settings. All types of authigenic carbonates are formed 

with an obligatory participation of microorganisms, among which many groups of 

sulfate reducers  and methanotrophs  (archea and bacteria) are most important. 

According to the first well-known model, microbial decay of organic matter in 

sediments  to HCO3 - results in an alkalinity increase due to H2S formation during 

sulfate reduction in the pore water. The participation of microbial processes in the 

23



carbonate formation under strongly anoxic conditions  is  controlled by the activity of 

different microbial groups, which produce intermediate products of methane 

oxidation. Bicarbonate of seawater and/or pore water participates  in the process 

as  a main oxygen source for carbonates. The third model is valid in the case of 

discharge of low-temperature hydrothermal fluids with a high concentration of H2, 

which is a good substrate for the specific group of sulfate reducers stimulating the 

increase in alkalinity of solutions and lead to the formation of carbonate buildups  at 

seepage sites. The whole variety of microorganism-mediated processes of the 

authigenic carbonate formation in ocean is  not exhausted by these three models 

(Lein, 2004).

As results  of the processes described before, Mg-calcite (+ protodolomite), calcite, 

and aragonite dominate among the authigenic carbonates. Holocene buildups 

(younger than 10 ka) at methane seepage sites on the seafloor mainly consist of 

mono-mineral aragonite (Lein, 2004). Sediments  are commonly cemented by 

authigenic Mg-calcite, also the carbonate nodules  are mainly composed of Mg-

calcite. Carbonate buildups  and nodules contain Sr and Ba. All authigenic 

carbonates are depleted in the heavy carbon isotope 13C and in general enriched 

in the heavy oxygen isotope 18O. 

The growth rate of carbonate buildups ranges  from  0.65 mm/yr to several 

millimeters per day under anaerobic conditions and from  0.02 to 0.37 mm/yr at the 

boundary between aerobic and anaerobic environments (Lein, 2004).

2.3 Fluid escape structures

2.3.1 Cold Seepages

In this  thesis all the studied carbonate samples are from  or associated with the 

cold seepage processes and are methane derived as discussed and shown in the 

fallowing chapters. Submarine hydrocarbon seeps  are geologically driven 

“hotspots” of increased biological activity on the seabed. A lot of sites of natural 

hydrocarbon seepage in the European margins  were investigated in detail during 

the last years, including mud volcanoes  and pockmarks, particularly important are 

24



the Gulf of Cádiz and the Mediterranean sea. Individual seeps  show ecosystem 

zonation related to the strength of the methane flux and distinct biogeochemical 

processes  in surface sediments. A common feature to the seeps is the formation of 

authigenic carbonates. These, exhibit various  morphologies  ranging from large 

pavements  and fragmented slabs to chimneys and mushroom-shaped mounds. 

These carbonates  form hard substrates are colonized by benthic fauna. Gas 

hydrate dissociation could contribute to sustain seep chemosynthetic communities 

over several thousand years following large gas-release events.

Since the first discovery of a hydrocarbon-associated cold seep community off 

Louisiana (Kennicut et al., 1985), hydrocarbon seepage and its close association 

with “hotspots” of increased biological activity have been documented at a number 

of seafloor sites worldwide (Judd and Hovland, 2007). Geological structures 

associated with the expulsion of hydrocarbon-rich fluids, such as mud volcanoes 

and pockmarks, have been recognized all around the planet, the most famous 

examples are the ones  on the margins  of the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean 

Sea, and the Black Sea, and new seepage sites continue to be discovered 

(Foucher, 2009). 

The phenomenon of gas seeps is  very important, is  frequently associated with the 

growth of distinct chemosynthetic communities (Sibuet et al., 1998) and with the 

occurrence of authigenic carbonate mineralization as a consequence of the 

microbially mediated oxidation of methane (Boetius  et al. 2000; Lein, 2004). 

Several of these features  can occur on the seafloor above petroleum reservoirs. 

Examples  of gas, and occasionally oil, leaking from reservoirs  include seeps from 

the Gulf of Mexico (Sassen et al. 1993), the south-eastern Mediterranean 

(Coleman et al.,  2001), the North Sea (Judd et al. 1994) and in a lot of other areas 

in the planet. Even at depth, fluid escape from hydrocarbon fields is one of the 

most frequent phenomena revealed by sub-surface investigation tools in 

hydrocarbon exploration and production (Mazzini et al., 2006).

Several different types  of cold seeps can be distinguished, according to the depth, 

as  shallow cold seeps and deep cold seeps. According to Judd et al., 2007, the 

different types of fluid escape structures that can be defined are as follows:

• oil seeps: are sites where liquid or gaseous  hydrocarbons escape to the surface 

25



or to the seafloor, through fractures and fissures  or through pore permeable 

sediments or sedimentary discontinuities. 

• gas seeps (usually methane seeps): are, like the oil seeps, sites in which gas, 

principally methane, escape to the surface through faults, fractures  or other high 

permeability geological structure.

• gas hydrate seeps: A particular case of gas seeps  occur when the pressure and 

temperature conditions  promote the formation of gas hydrates  and on these 

situations  methane occurs  also in the form of gas  hydrates. Gas  hydrates  are 

ice-like minerals  that form at low temperatures  (usually at about 2-4 C) and high 

pressures  in the deep sea. Hydrates  contain gases, such as  hydrocarbons, that 

glue themselves  inside symmetrical cages  of water molecules to form  hydrate 

crystals. Research submarines are the ideal tool to study hydrates under natural 

conditions. Gas hydrate is a water clathrate of natural gas. Thus, gas hydrate is 

a naturally occurring solid comprised of water molecules  forming a rigid lattice of 

cages, where most cages contain molecules of natural gas, mainly methane. 

Natural gas hydrates are therefore a subgroup of the clathrates. The term 

hydrate is applied to clathrates  in which the structural molecules are water (H2O) 

and the guest spaces are occupied by gas molecules (Judd et al., 2007).

The term natural is used to indicate gas  hydrates that occur naturally on Earth, 

rather than being synthesized in laboratory or inadvertently created during 

industrial transportation of petroleum gas. The term natural also indicates  that 

the gas  that is  incorporated on the hydrate is  of natural origin, corresponds to 

natural gas, which corresponds to all gases derived from  natural occurring 

chemical and biochemical processes. Natural gas hydrates  occur wherever 

conditions are suitable. As  water is  ubiquitous on Earth and, after water, the 

second more ubiquitous  compound in sediments is methane, the most 

widespread natural gas hydrate on Earth are methane hydrates. Methane occurs 

in nature often accompanied by higher molecular weight hydrocarbon gases and 

by non-hydrocarbon gases. So, natural gas hydrates can also occur with other 

relatively light molecular weight hydrocarbons  such as  C2H6, C3H8, C4H10, and 

non-hydrocarbons such as CO2, N2 and H2S.

• brine seeps (usually form  brine pools): Brine pools are sites  of brine fluids 

26



discharge into the  seafloor. These pools  are bodies of water that have salinity 

three to five times greater than the surrounding seawater. The brine often 

contains  high concentrations  of methane, providing energy to chemosynthetic 

animals that live near the pool. Deep sea brine pools  often coincide with cold 

seeps. Methane released by the seep is processed by bacteria, which have a 

symbiotic relationship with seep mussels living at the edge of the pool (Judd et 

al., 2007).

• pockmarks: Pockmarks  are crater-like structures in the seabed, formed by the 

expulsion of gas  and/or water from sediments. These features occur world-wide, 

in the ocean at all depths (Judd et al., 2007).

• mud volcanos: Mud volcanoes are sedimentary structures formed by the 

emission of argillaceous material, water, brine, gas and oil (Milkov 2000). Such 

fluid venting structures  occur in terrestrial and marine environments  worldwide 

and are caused by tectonic stress (Milkov 2000, Pinheiro et al., 2003). These 

processes  can lead to over-pressured pore fluids  that promote the upword 

migration of over pressurized sediments  and, finally, their extrusion at the 

surface or seabottom  with the emissions  of mud, water and gas that accumulate 

forming conical, volcanic edifices (Judd et al., 2007).

Various  examples of authigenic carbonates from modern marine cold seeps  have 

been described from  continental margins worldwide (e.g., Campbell et al., 2002). 

They may or may not be associated with gas  hydrates. The samples used in this 

thesis are found in close association with mud volcanoes  and active and fossil cold 

seeps associated with faults (Luff et al., 2004; Judd et al., 2007).

Microbiological and geochemical studies  proved that in marine cold seep 

environments, methane and other hydrocarbon compounds contained in the 

ascending fluids  are anaerobically oxidized to CO2 by a microbial consortium of 

sulfate-reducing bacteria and methanotrophic archea (Boetius  et al., 2000). 

Anaerobic oxidation of methane is the main microbial process  driving the 

precipitation of authigenic carbonates  within subsurface anoxic sediments. This 

process explains  why the seafloor is often hardened by carbonate constructions at 

the sites  of active methane seepage. The lateral and vertical extent of these 

27



authigenic carbonate constructions is  controlled by the balance between the 

intensity of the venting fluid flux and the ability of the microbial-archaea 

consortiums  to oxidize methane and reduce the sulfate. However, the efficiency of 

this  microbial-archaea consortiums can be counteracted by high methane flux, so 

that methane can escape into the water column and may eventually reach the 

atmosphere. Numerical modeling of carbonate crust formation has  shown that 

bioturbation and sedimentation rates  are also important factors  in controlling the 

flow of water and methane, and thus  carbonate precipitation at cold seep sites 

(Luff et al., 2004).

The authigenic carbonates  observed at the seafloor exhibit various  morphologies: 

(i) massive to porous crusts, centimeters  to meters  thick, that form  large 

pavements  or fragmented slabs; (ii) circular chimneys, and (iii) irregular 

concretions corresponding to cemented bioturbation casts. These hard substrates 

are often colonized by fixed organisms such as  tubeworms and molluscs (bivalves 

and gastropods), as  well as by abundant fauna (crustaceans, fishes) (Cunha, C. 

2009 – PhD Thesis).

Authigenic carbonates  can therefore provide a record of the history and evolution 

of cold seeps activity. Their mineralogy, geochemical and isotopic signatures 

depend on the composition of the fluids  and thus  provide information on the origin 

of these fluids and their evolution through time. It is noteworthy that carbonate 

mineral associations are generally dominated by aragonite and Mg-calcite, 

although dolomite and ankerite may become the dominant carbonate phase (Aloisi 

et al., 2000; Gontharet et al., 2007) as  in some types of authigenic carbonates 

such as  in the dolomite chimneys  of the Gulf of Cádiz (Diaz-del-Rio et al., 2003; 

Magalhães  et al., 2012). All cold-seep carbonates  are characterized by very 

negative !13C values, as low as  -54.7 (VPDB), clearly indicating that they are 

methane-derived products  (Kulm  et al., 1986; Hovland et al., 1988). Lipid 

biomarkers  entrapped in the carbonate cements provide complementary 

information on the composition of the microbial communities  that were involved 

during the formation processes, sowing evidences  of the presence of anaerobic 

oxidation of methane, sulfate reduction, and methanogenesis  (Bouloubassi et al., 

2006; Niemann et al., 2006).

28



2.3.2 Mud Volcanoes

Mud volcanoes  are a manifestation of natural fluid migration and extrusion at the 

Earth’s surface. They are geologic structures  formed as  result of the emission of 

mud, water and gas, usually CH4, saturated to the surface or at the seafloor 

(Dimitrov, 2002). Often, included in the mud are rock clasts, ranging in size from  a 

few millimeters  to 10 m or more. These clasts may be of various lithological types 

and are derived from the walls of the conduits through which the over-pressurized 

fluid mixture has  passed on its way to the surface. Mud volcanoes  are 

morphologically diverse, ranging from  semi-symmetrical mound shapes  rising 

several hundred meters  above the adjacent countryside to regular and irregular 

conical shapes. Mud volcanoes vary in size from  small landforms of less than a 

meter in diameter to large structures occupying more than 100 km2. Eruptions  at 

mud volcanoes  may be gentle or violent. In gentle eruptions, the mud volcanoes 

expand by gradual and progressive outflows  of liquid mud. In violent eruptions,

also emit natural gas. Numbers indicate the count of seeps in a given region. Redrawn and mo-
dified from Wilson et al. (1973, 1974) (Kvenvolden et al, 2005).



mud and mud breccia may shoot up in the air to heights  of a few kilometers. The 

emitted gas may ignite to produce spectacular flames. Mud volcanoes  are globally 

distributed and occur in both the terrestrial and marine environments (figure 4). 

The number of prominent individual mud volcanoes totals  1950 (Dimitrov, 2003), 

although the count is  continuously increasing as the knowledgement, especially on 

the continental margins, increases. Mud volcanoes are irregularly clustered in 

belts that generally coincide with areas  of active plate boundaries  and zones of 

young orogenic activity (Dimitrov, 2002). More than half of the total number of mud 

volcanoes is located along the Alpine–Himalayan Active Belt where there are 

about 650 terrestrial and at least 470 offshore prominent examples. The largest 

and most active mud volcanoes can be found along this Belt (figure 7).

Interest in mud volcanoes  has recently increased because, in part, their methane 

(a strong green house gas) emissions may have implications  for global climate 

change. Dimitrov (2002) provides  a comprehensive review of mud volcano 

occurrence, plumbing systems, and possible geologic consequences. In addition, 

there are recent reports of mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Mexico (MacDonald et al., 

2000), offshore Nigeria (Graue, 2000), South Caspian Sea (Voitov, 2001), 

Southwest African continental margin (Ben-Avraham et al., 2002), northern 

Apennines  of Italy (Capozzi and Picotti, 2002), Sicily (Etiope et al., 2002), western 

Mediterranean Sea (Sautkin et al., 2003), Gulf of Cadiz (Pinheiro et al., 2003, 

Somoza et al., 2003; (Van Rensbergen et al., 2005; Van Rensbergen et al., 2005), 

eastern Romania (Etiope et al., 2004), and East China Sea (Yin et al., 2003).

2.3.3 Pockmarks

Pockmarks are concave, crater-like features on the seafloor, generally up to 

several hundreds of meters in diameter and tens  of meters  in relief (Kelley et al. 

1994). Mega pockmarks were also described and can have diameters  of more 

than 1.5 km and depths exceeding 150 m (Pilcher et al, 2007). The formation of 

pockmarks is  mostly caused by the seepage at the seafloor of thermogenic and 

biogenic origin gases, mainly methane (Rogers et al. 2006) and by the release of 

pore water . Pockmarks occur in lakes  (Pickrill et al, 1993), shallow bays, estuaries 

and fjords (e.g. Hovland et al.,  1988; Kelley et al. 1994; Plassen et al.,  2003, 

Rogers  et al. 2006; Forwick et al., 2009), on continental shelves, slopes and rises, 

30



as  well as in the deep sea (Piper et al. 1999; Paull et al. 2002; Loncke et al. 2004; 

Gay et al. 2007; Forwick et al., 2009).

The lateral distribution of pockmarks  can be controlled by tectonic lineaments  (e.g. 

Chand et al. 2008), underlying permeable bedrock and lithological boundaries 

( Paull et al. 2002; Forwick et al., 2009), as well as  buried channels  (Gay et al. 

2003; Pilcher et al., 2007; Forwick et al., 2009). However, they also occur near 

slope failures  (Hovland et al. 2002; Forwick et al., 2009) and in areas of rapid 

deposition (Pilcher et al., 2007; Forwick et al., 2009). Pockmarks are furthermore 

described from areas  that have been affected by the up-drift of ice that detached 

from the sub-seafloor (Paull et al. 1999), decomposing gas hydrates and where 

gas is  released due to melting permafrost (Long 1992). They can also be induced 

31

Figure 8:  Illustration of a pockmark and underlying chimney during a phase of active expulsion 
of free gas. The passage of free gas through the hydrate stability zone is aided  by the formation 
of hydrate around the  pathways through which the gas is passing, inhibiting access of the gas to 
the pore  water and preventing conversion of all  the gas to  hydrate. Progressive formation of 
hydrate and carbonate near the  seabed seals pathways, causing an outward migration of the 
active gas vents. ( Foucher et al, 2009)



by grounded moving icebergs  or anthropogenic activities  such as trawling and ship 

anchoring (Harrington 1985; Fader 1991; Forwick et al., 2009).

According to Judd et al., 2007, pockmarks  are classified based on their 

morphology in:

• circular,

• elliptical, 

•asymmetric, 

•composite .

Pickrill (1993) classified the pockmarks as  function on their state of development 

as:

• new,

•growing, 

•decaying 

Another classification proposed by Pilcher et al., (2007) based on their lateral 

distribution and formation mechanisms defines:

•fault- strike pockmarks, 

•iceberg scour pockmarks, 

•current-modified pockmarks.

The formation of pockmarks  can occur catastrophically in a very short period of 

time (e.g. due to earthquakes, tsunamis, storms, melting of ground ice) or can be 

formed more continuously over longer periods  (Kelley et al. 1994; Hovland et al. 

2002; Forwick et al., 2009).

2.4 Chemiosynthetic Fauna

Chemosynthesis  is the biological conversion of one or more carbon molecules 

(usually carbon dioxide or methane) and nutrients  into organic matter using the 

oxidation of inorganic molecules (such as  hydrogen gas, hydrogen sulfide) or 

methane as a source of energy, rather than sunlight, as  in photosynthesis 

(Foucher et al, 2009). Chemoautotrophs, organisms  that obtain carbon through 

chemosynthesis, are phylogenetically diverse, but groups that include conspicuous 

or biogeochemically important taxa include the sulfur-oxidizing gamma and epsilon 

proteobacteria, the Aquificaeles, the Methanogenic archaea and the neutrophilic 

iron-oxidizing bacteria (Foucher et al., 2009).

32



Many microorganisms  in dark regions of the oceans also use chemosynthesis  to 

produce biomass from single carbon molecules. Two categories can be 

distinguished. In the rare sites at which hydrogen molecules (H2) are available, the 

energy available from  the reaction between CO2 and H2 (leading to production of 

methane, CH4) can be large enough to drive the production of biomass. 

Alternatively, in most oceanic environments, energy for chemosynthesis  derives 

from reactions  in which substances such as hydrogen sulfide or ammonia are 

oxidized. This may occur with or without the presence of oxygen.

Many chemosynthetic microorganisms  are consumed by other organisms in the 

ocean, and symbiotic associations  between chemosynthesizers  and respiring 

33

Figure 9: Illustration of a pockmark and underlying chimney when only pore water is migrating 
through the  system. Methane from hydrate created during the free-gas expulsion phase keeps the 
methane in solution in the migrating pore water at saturation concentration, supporting chemosynt-
hetic biota in the pockmark, until  all  the hydrate is removed in solution. This process may continue 
for thousands of years, with only moderate amounts of hydrate and  concentration  of methane in 
solution in the pore water entering the chimney from below.(Foucher et. al, 2009) 



heterotrophs are quite common. Large populations  of animals  can be supported by 

chemosynthetic secondary production at hydrothermal vents, methane clathrates, 

cold seeps, and whale falls (Foucher et al., 2009).

Giant tube worms  use bacteria in their trophosome to react hydrogen sulfide with 

oxygen as a source of energy. Some reactions produce sulfur, such as:

Hydrogen sulfide chemosynthesis:

 CO2 + O2 + 4H2S ! CH2O + 4S + 3H2O

(CH2O is used to mean carbohydrate, not formaldehyde.)

Instead of releasing oxygen gas as in photosynthesis, solid globules  of sulfur are 

produced (Kiel, 2010).

2.4.1 Methane hydrate and chemosynthetic biota at cold seeps

At seeps  where methane is  escaping into the water column as free gas  it is 

evident that there is an abundant supply of subseabed methane for 

chemosynthetic biota (figure 8), but there are many seeps that support 

chemosynthetic biota where methane is  only in solution in the pore water that 

flows through the seep. Methane hydrate beneath the seabed plays an important 

role where seeps lie within its stability field, generally in water depths greater than 

400 m. Hydrate provides  a metastable reservoir of methane, and it buffers  the 

concentration of pore water methane in solution (figure 9).

Estimates  of how long hydrate could provide a viable source of methane to 

chemosynthetic biota at the seabed under different conditions  were made using a 

one-dimensional advection-diffusion model (Ivanov et al., 2007). The model 

assumes that, initially, hydrate lies 1 m beneath the seabed and the sulfate-

methane transition (SMT) is at 30-cm depth. Above the SMT, methane is not 

present in the pore water, because it has  been anaerobically oxidized with 

microbial mediation, taking the oxygen from sulfate that has  diffused downward 

from the seawater to produce sulfide and bicarbonate (Boetius  et al., 2000). If the 

SMT is  much more than about 1-m  deep, methane in pore water is out of reach of 

most of the biota living at or near the seabed.

Depletion of a layer containing 12.5% hydrate by chemical diffusion alone will 

34



cause the top to recede down- ward from  1m to 3m  depth below the seabed after 

1800 years  (figure 10). The SMT will deepen from 0.3 to 1 m  and the methane flux 

will decrease from  2.1–0.7 mol m-2 yr-1. Consumption rates  of methane by in situ 

chemosynthetic biota vary greatly and are species  dependent (Torres et al., 2002; 

Boetius and Suess, 2004), but a rate of a few tenths  of a mol m-2 yr-1 appears  to 

be sufficient for some species  (Niemann et al., 2006a). So, although the methane 

flux would still appear to be sufficiently high, the increasing depth of the SMT 

below 1 m would progressively reduce the viability of chemosynthetic biota.

Upward advection of methane in solution in pore water can halt the downward 

movement of the top of the hydrate and the SMT. For the model case, this  is 

produced by a fluid flow rate of 35 mm  yr-1 with the concentration of methane 

35

Fig 10: Schematic representation of the control of methane concentration beneath the seabed by 
the initial concentration  of methane in solution in upwardly migrating pore  water, the  presence of 
hydrate, and sulfate  in the seawater. The concentration of dissolved methane in  the rising pore 
water controls the depth  at which hydrate begins to form. If it is less than the lowest value of met-
hane solubility, then all  previously formed hydrate will  be removed, but the rate of removal de-
pends upon the  degree  to which the pore water is undersaturated and the rate  of pore-water flow. ( 
Foucher et. al, 2009)



buffered by the hydrate at 60 mol m-3. The concentration of methane in solution in 

the pore water that enters the layer containing hydrate and the rate of flow of the 

water control how quickly the hydrate is  removed. The layer would be diminished 

from beneath, where methane solubility is  higher and the rising pore water first 

comes into contact with the hydrate. At one extreme, a 10-m-thick layer would be 

removed in 160 years if the concentration of methane in solution was zero and the 

fluid flow rate was 1 m  yr-1. For a near-saturation methane concentration of 55 mol 

m-3 and a fluid flux of 35 mm yr-1, it would take 5500 years to reduce the thickness 

of the hydrate by one meter, while providing a methane flux of 2.1 mol m-2 yr-1 and 

maintaining the top of the hydrate and SMT at their initial depths.

In short, if hydrate had been produced at shallow depth by an event releasing a 

high volume of free gas in the past, an accumulation of methane hydrate of low-to-

moderate concentration and a few meters thick near the seabed could sustain 

communities of chemosynthetic biota for periods of several thousands to a few 

tens  of thousands of years at seep sites  where methane concentration in pore 

water is  high but not exceeding saturation. Such an event may have lasted only a 

few years or less, depending on the efficiency with which hydrate was  formed from 

the escaping free gas. Consequently, short-lived, catastrophic gas  venting at the 

beginning of the Holocene or earlier could, without subsequent reactivation, have 

provided the source of methane for active, present-day communities of 

chemosynthetic biota (Foucher et al., 2009)

Chapter 3: The Gulf of Cadiz

3.1 Study Area

The Gulf of Cádiz is  located between 34°N and 37°15'N and 6°W to 9°45'W.  It is 

the part of the Atlantic Ocean between Cape St. Vincent in Portugal and Cape 

Trafalgar at the western end of the Strait of Gibraltar.  It corresponds  to the 

southern Iberian and northern Moroccan margins at north and south, respectively. 

The  Gibraltar Strait, at east, defines the connection to the Mediterranean Sea.

The geological history of the Gulf of Cádiz is closely related to the plate tectonic 

interaction between Southern Eurasia and North Africa and is driven by two main 

mechanisms: (1) subduction associated with the westward emplacement of the 

Gibraltar Arc, and (2) the formation of the Gulf of Cádiz accretionary wedge, 

probably not active at present (Maldonado et al., 1999).

The whole area is under compressive/transpressive deformation and events of 

mud volcanism  and processes associated with the escape of hydrocarbon-rich 

fluids were discovered. These fluid migration and escape structures  sustain a 

broad diversity of chemosynthetic assemblages  (Cunha, 2007; Rodrigues, 2009). 

This  extensive area encompasses more than 42 mud volcanoes, at depths  ranging 

from 200 to 4600 m  (confirmed by coring), and active methane seepage has  been 

documented on several locations (Pinheiro et al., 2003, Magalhães et al., 2012).

3.2 Geological Setting

The Gulf of Cadiz is located at the front of the Betic-Rifian Arc. It has  had a very 

complex geological history and undergone several episodes of extension, 

compression and strike-slip motion (Maldonado et al., 1999). The westward 

migration of the Gibraltar arc during the Late Miocene (5Myr) caused the formation 

of a fore-arc basin in the actual area of the Gulf of Cadiz (Maldonado et al., 1999). 

The emplacement of the thrusting units, gravitational sliding of the mobile shale 

and salt stocks formed a giant deposit-mass, called Gibraltar Olistostrome, that 

migrated west towards the Horseshoe and Seine abyssal plains (Maldonado et al., 

1999). This  olistostrome body consists  of a chaotic mixture of Triassic, 

Cretaceous, Paleogene and Neogene sedimentary units, deposited on top of the 

Palaeozoic basement. These chaotic units involve a huge volume of Triassic mud 

37



and salt salt units and under-compacted Early-Middle Miocene plastic marls 

(Maldonado et al. 1999).

Throughout this area, pockmarks, extensive mud volcanism and mud diapirism, 

carbonate mounds and fields  of high density chimneys, crusts and pavements 

related to hydrocarbon rich fluid venting are observed (Somoza et al., 2003; 

Pinheiro et al., 2003; Ivanov et al. 2007). In the south Iberia margin it is  prominent 

38

the presence of a large NE-SW diapiric ridge, the Guadalquivir Diapiric Ridge 

(GDR) that runs  from  the shelf break up to 1200 m  water depth. This ridge is  very 

important in the oceanography and the sedimentary dynamics of this  margin 

because it controls  the orientation of the main channel of the MOW 

(Mediterranean Outflow Water) undercurrent that have an important control on the 

erosion, sediment transport and deposition along the northern margin of the Gulf 

of Cadiz. The GDR is  composed of a series  of wide sub-circular conical mounds 

surrounded by ring-shaped seafloor depressions (Somoza et al., 2003; Diaz-del-

Rio, et al., 2003; Leon et al., 2007).

In the Gulf of Cádiz area, the present-day convergence between the African and 

Eurasian plates  is ~4 mm/y with a northwest–southeast trend, and it is  being 

accommodated over a broad diffuse deformation zone (Stow et al, 2011). 

Nevertheless, different periods  of crustal deformation, and plates  movements are 

known to have controlled the evolution of this  part of the Iberian Peninsula. The 

rifting phases  that characterize the opening of the central and North Atlantic basin 

since the late Triassic to the Early Cretaceous  had also constrained the deep 

structure of the Gulf of Cadiz (Pinheiro et al., 1996; Wilson et al., 1996; Borges et 

al., 2001) and its later deformation during the Cenozoic, especially in the Miocene 

(Zittellini et al., 2009). Those are the most important phases and the ones that give 

to the Gulf of Cadiz his  present-day global configuration. The Gulf of Cádiz 

Cenozoic evolution was  controlled by the Alpine tectonic phases that affected the 

southern part of the European plate. Since the late Miocene, the northwest–

southeast compressional regime has  been developed simultaneously with the 

extensional collapse of the Betic-Rif orogenic front, by westward emplacement of a 

giant "olistostrome," the Cádiz Allochthonous  Unit (CAU), and by very high rates  of 

basin subsidence coupled with strong diapiric activity (Maldonado et al., 1999). At 

the end of the Messinian, a transtensional regime caused the reopening of the 

connection between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean through the Strait of 

Gibraltar (Maldonado et al., 1999). By the end of the early Pliocene, subsidence 

decreased and the margin evolved toward its  present shape (Maldonado et al., 

1999; Medialdea et al., 2004). The tectonics structure and evolution represented a 

key long-term  factor in affecting the seafloor morphology, which has  then exerted a 

39



strong control on the pathways of MOW, on the geomorphology and sedimentary 

architecture of the present-day Gulf of Cadiz. As  a result of the complex geological 

evolution, the bathymetry of the continental shelf, slope and rise of the Gulf of 

Cadiz is  quite irregular and exhibits widely varying gradients resulting from  the 

interference of several different geomorphologic processes  and structures. The 

shelf area can be divided into four morphological provinces; (a) the inner shelf, (b) 

the smooth mid-shelf, (c) the south-east shelf with bedforms, and (d) the outer 

shelf (Nelson et al., 1999).

The shelf break occurs at about 130 and 20 m  water depth.  In the continental 

slope it is  possible to  differentiate into four morphologic provinces: (a) a narrow 

belt between 130 and 400 m formed by the steeper (2–3°) upper slope, (b) two 

40

Cádiz and West Iberian margin with proposed site locations. Morphosedimentary sectors (1–5). 
(Hernandez-Molina et al., 2006)



gently dipping (&lt;1°) wide terraces  located between 400 and 700 m  water depth on 

both the southeast and northwest sides  of the Gulf of Cadiz middle slope, (c) a 

central section between the terraces  in which several, steep (3–30°), narrow 

curvilinear ridges  (3–10 km width) and valleys  (1–3 km  width) with general trends 

ranging from NE–SW to E–W, and (d) a smooth lower slope from 900 to 1500 m 

that is  more steeply dipping (2–4°) and incised by shallow valleys  in a NE–SW 

direction (Nelson et al., 1999).

  

3.3 Oceanographic setting

The present-day circulation pattern is  dominated by the exchange of water masses 

between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea through the Strait of 

Gibraltar (figure 13). This  exchange is  driven by the influx into the Atlantic of the 

Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW), highly saline and warm  water mass, that 

flows near the bottom; and by the superficial influx of Atlantic water into the 

Mediterranean Sea, of less  saline and cool-water and generates  important 

sedimentary processes along the Atlantic margin (Serra et al., 2010a, 2010b).

The Mediterranean outflow as  it comes out of the Gibraltar Sill it flows as  a bottom 

current due to is high density and due to the Coriolis  effect it turns  to the right, 

flowing as  a bottom  current along the northern margin of the upper slope of the 

Gulf of Cadiz (Figure 13). In the Gulf of Cádiz, MOW flows between 500 and 1400 

meters  below sea level (mbsl) (Cherubin et al., 2000). Its  distribution along the 

Margin is then conditioned by the complex morphology of the continental slope, in 

fact it generates two main sub currents, the upper-one, located between 500 and 

700 mbsl, is  called the Mediterranean upper water (MUW); and the lower-one, 

between 800 and 1400 mbsl, that is called Mediterranean lower water (MLW) 

(Borenäs  et al., 2002). In the western sectors, the interaction of these branches 

with the seafloor generates big vortices, the so-called meddies, that are 

subsurface masses  with anti-cyclonically rotation of warm salty water of the MO in 

the Atlantic Ocean water .

Between ~500 and 1500 mbsl, the water column along the West Iberian margin is 

dominated by the warm, salty MOW and its two sub-currents. Below MOW at 

41



~1600 mbsl on the north margin is  possible to find a water mass originated from 

the Labrador Sea Water (LSW). Below 2000 mbsl, recirculated Northeast Atlantic 

Deep Water (NEADW) prevails, which represents a mixture of LSW, Iceland 

Scotland Overflow Water (ISOW), Denmark Strait Overflow Water (DSOW), and to 

a lesser extent MOW and Lower Deep Water (LDW). Abyssal water in the region 

consists of a lower fringe of NEADW, with an increasing composition of southern-

sourced LDW with depth until ~4000 mbsl, where LDW dominates  (Stow et al., 

2011). 

3.4 Carbonate Chimneys

Dolomite chimneys  are interpreted as cemented conduits  formed as result of 

42

(modfied from Hernánder-Molina et al., 2006) (Stow et al., 2011)



methane-enriched fluid expulsion through the sediments. The abundant pseudo-

pyrite framboids  are related with the zone of shallow microbial sulphate reduction, 

a process fundamental to the nourishment of the chemosynthetic cold seep 

communities. In the last years, it has been considered the importance of carbonate 

cementation related with methane fluxes, both on submarine modern 

environments and on rocks of the fossil record (Orpin 1997; Somoza et al. 2002; 

Díaz-del-Río et al., 2003). Large fluxes  of methane seem  responsible for dolomite 

cementation, instead low and less  intense fluxes involve the cementation of high-

Mg calcite and aragonite. Recently, it has  been proposed that extensive anaerobic 

microbial communities exist in sedimentary layers  below(methane) vent fields 

(DeLong 2000). The sum  of the syntrophy cooperation between methane-oxidisers 

(archaeobacterias domain) and sulphate-reducers microorganism produces 

carbonates and sulphides at the sulphate-methane interface, the depth below 

seafloor at this  reaction occurs  will  depend on the methane flux rate (DeLong 

2000). 

Carbonate dolomite chimneys  are found to be associated with hydrocarbon-rich 

fluid venting. They occur in several places  on continental margins, such as  in the 

Campos  Basin of the Bazilian Margin (Miller, 2006), in the Krishna-Godavari Basin, 

eastern continental margin of India (Muralidhar et al., 2006); in the Otago 

continental slope, southern New Zealand (Orpin, 1997); Kuroshima Knoll, Ryukyu 

Islands, Japan, (Takeuchi et al., 2007); Denmark Margin (Jørgensen, 1989); and 

also in the Gulf of Cadiz (Díaz-del-Río et al., 2003; Magalhães, 2007; Magalhães 

et al., 2012). In the Gulf of Cadiz, dolomite chimneys were discovered in 

September 2000 during the cruise Anastasya/2000 aboard of research vessel 

Cornide de Saavedra dredging a 870 m-deep and 120 m-tall carbonate mound 

called as  the "Iberico". Here were collected more than 60 individual structures  of 

chimneys  with distinct pipe-like morphologies  that varies from  1 to 0.40 m long 

(Díaz-del-Río et al., 2003). 

The chimneys are dominated by Fe-riched dolomite (ankerite) forming aggregates 

with minor amounts of pyrite, iron oxide, Ta-enriched rutile, zircon and quartz. 

Abundant, well preserved remains of foraminifera (globigerinoids and milioids) 

composed of Mg-calcite are present within the matrix. Dolomite aggregates are 

43



depleted in 13C (-35 to -56‰  PDB) and are therefore interpreted being the result of 

methane oxidation by sulphate-reducing bacteria. Aggregates  of single bacteria 

produces rounded to pentagonal shaped framboids  of pyrite. Latter oxidation 

resulting from  the contact with the sea bottom seawater resulted in the 

replacement of  the major part of these bacterial-origin framboids by haematite. At 

same time, some of framboids  have been found in the interior of the foraminifers, 

which could suggest some symbiotic association between foraminifer and 

chemosyntectic bacteria (Somoza et al., 2002 and Díaz-del-Río et al., 2003).

3.5 Carbonate Crusts
The authigenic carbonates can also precipitate in the form  of carbonate crusts or 

pavements, that form   thin (cm size) crusts  up to massive crusts  with up to 50 cm 

thick crusts or even several meters high mounds, at the sediment surface or within 

surface sediments. These carbonate crusts are built under a narrow range of 

physical, chemical and biological conditions. They are indicators  of a relatively 

slow (20–90 cm  a!1) but pervasive (100–500 years) upwards flow of methane-

charged (&gt;50 mM CH4) fluids  (Pinheiro et al., 2003; Niemann et al., 2006). It is 

generally accepted that in the systems  wherethe authigenic carbonate crusts are 

formed, the dominant fraction of the rising methane is  anaerobically oxidized within 

the sediment and sequestered as  carbonate, and as result only a very small 

amount methane can escape to the seabottom water column (Kvendolven et al., 

2005). Carbonate crust formation has also the potential to affect the persistence 

and distribution of chemosynthesis-based benthic communities  at cold seeps. By 

strongly inhibiting transport processes, the carbonate crusts  separate sulfate from 

methane, decreasing the overall rates  of the anaerobic oxidation of methane and 

of the consequent production of sulfide. Because most of the chemosynthesis 

supporting the development of macro-benthos  at cold vents is  based on the 

oxidation of sulfide produced through the anaerobic oxidation of methane, the 

potential of these systems, where active carbonate crust formation occurs, to 

harbor such organisms is severely decreased (Pinheiro et al., 2003; Kvendolven et 

al., 2005; Niemann et al., 2006).

The carbonate crusts also act as a fluid migration barrier, inhibiting or blocking the 

44



upward flow of fluids through the sediments. Thus, sedimentary carbonate crusts 

may diverge and focus the fluid flow to adjacent areas not affected by crust 

formation. In the area of study, the Gulf of Cadiz, is possible to find two principal 

typology of carbonate crusts:

Dolomite crusts. This  type of crust can be distinct from  the dolomite chimneys by 

just by the difference in the morphology . Dolomite crusts have planar shapes, up 

to 10 cm thick and up to 70 cm  across, they present no internal structure, low 

porosity, no macro-porosity or internal channels and neither shells nor biogenic 

components (except for foraminifera and coccoliths) (Somoza et al., 2003; 

Magalhães et al., 2007 and Magalhães et al., 2012). 

Aragonite crusts. In all the aragonite crusts  authigenic aragonite is  the dominant 

mineral with subordinate authigenic calcite and high-Mg calcite (Magalhães  et al., 

2012), cementing a detrital fraction of quartz, feldspars, clays, mud volcano mud 

breccia clasts, shell fragments, foraminifera and calcareous nannofossils. The 

aragonite crusts  present a significant macro-porosity (voids, fractures, tubular and 

irregular cavities some of them interconnected) and high percentages of open 

inter-granular pore space, indicating formation within very weakly compacted 

sediments  (Somoza et al., 2003; Magalhães et al., 2007 and Magalhães et al., 

2012).

3.6 Mud Volcanoes 

The first discover and confirmation by ground-truthing of mud volcanoes  in the 

Gulf of Cadiz was in 1999 during the TTR-9 cruise (Gardner, 2001). Since then, 

this  area has been intensively investigated. Most of this  work was  carried out 

within the framework of the INGMAR (PLE/4/98), the Training Through Research 

program  (IOC/UNESCO), and the MVSEIS - Euromargins  (01-LEC-EMA24F http://

www2.geo.ua.pt/mvseis/Mud_volcanoes.htm) projects, all of them  leaded 

(MVSEIS) or with the active involvement of researchers from the University of 

Aveiro. As  result, 46 mud volcanoes were discovered and confirmed by coring in 

this  area during several cruises.(Extensive hydrocarbon-rich fluid venting and mud 

diapirism were also observed throughout this  area (Ivanov et al., 2000;  Díaz-del-

Río et al., 2003; Pinheiro et al., 2003; Somoza et al., 2003). These are related to 

45



the lateral compression from Africa–Eurasia convergence, that promoted the fluid 

migration, from deeper parts  of the basin, throughout faults, up to the seafloor. 

Several NE–SW oriented diapiric mud ridges  have been found in the shallow NE 

sector of the Gulf of Cadiz. This area is characterized by abundant carbonate 

chimneys and crusts on top of these ridges (Gonzalez et al., 2009).

Most of the mud volcanoes  in the eastern domain of the Gulf of Cádiz are found 

located between 350–2000 m water depth, parallel to the NE–SW and NW–SE 

main directions ,. Deeper mud volcanoes have also been recognized on the lower 

slope at 2300–4600 m depth (Madialdea et al., 2009, Magalhães  et al., 2012). 

Most of those mud volcanoes  are clearly controlled by the so-called SWIM 

lineaments (Hensen et al., 2007; Scholz et al., 2009) (see figure 14). These SWIM 

46

Figure 14: Map od the Mud Volcanoes descovered and confirmed in the Gulf of Cadiz until 2008. 
(Golnzález et al., 2009)



lineaments correspond to the bathymetric expressions  of strike slip faults, that 

most probably correspond to the reactivation of WNW-ESE pre-existing faults, and 

are segmented, of crustal-scale, extending from the Gorringe Bank to the Gibraltar 

area in the eastern Gulf of Cadiz (Zitellini et al., 2009; Magalhães et., at 2009). 

Zitellini et al. (2009) suggested that these faults mark a developing Eurasia-Africa 

plate boundary in the region. In particular, the lineaments  passing through the 

study area consist of a network of shear structures  that evokes the development of 

an incipient strike-slip fault system. These geological structures  are known to 

provide fluid migration pathways (Moore and Vrolijk, 1992).

Geographically, the mud volcanoes  are distributed in three main areas of the Gulf 

of Cádiz. Most of them are found on the upper and middle slope between 350 and 

2000 m  water depth, either on the northern Iberian margin, where they are found 

aligned along the regional compressive structures with a roughly NE-SW 

orientation (Somoza et al., 2003; Díaz-del-Río et al., 2003); or on the Moroccan 

margin, following an approximately regionally dominant NW–SE direction (Pinheiro 

et al., 2003; Madialdea et al., 2009). 

Some of the most important and well-studied mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz 

are:

• Bonjardim mud volcano: It appears  as  an approximately circular, isolated feature, 

with a diameter of 1 km almost, it has  a height of approximately 100 m  with a 

seafloor depression at the rim of the cone.

• Carlos  Ribeiro mud volcano: is located at a depth of 2200 m, with a height of 

approximately 80 m and a diameter of 1.5 km.

• Olenin mud volcano: it appears as a dome-like structure, located on a slope.

• Jesus Baraza mud volcano it has a circular feature . With a prominent high, 

maximum height above seafloor of about 150 m.

• Student mud volcano presents a sub-circular feature. 

Three new mud volcanoes: Michael Ivanov, Absu and Tiamat mud volcanoes  has 

been recently discovered during the RV Meteor M86/5 Cruise on march 2012. 

Some of the gravity cores recovered on the Michael Ivanov mud volcano are 

analyzed in this thesis.

Chapter 4: Materials
The samples studied in this Master thesis  project correspond to carbonates crusts 

and chimneys collected from 5 different areas  of Gulf of Cadiz (on small mounds 

on the MOW channel in front of Gibraltar Strait, on the Vernadsky Ridge, on the 

Pen Duick escarpment, on top of Mercator and Meknes  mud volcanoes, and on 

Michael Ivanov mud volcano) as illustrated in the Figure 15 and reported in table 

2. These samples  were collected during four different cruises: TTR 14; TTR 15; 

TTR 16 and M86/5.

4.1 Cruises

The carbonate samples considered in this  thesis  came from four different cruises 

that interested the Gulf of cadiz in the passed years.

Cruise TTR 14 
The TTR 14 cruise, Leg 1,was carried out in 2004, onboard the RV Professor 

Logachev, as  part of the fourteenth Training-through-Research Cruise integrated in 

the framework of the MVSeis  project and where researchers  from the university of 

Aveiro had participate. The objectives  of this leg were twofold: to conduct detailed 

investigations  of geological and biological processes  on the continental margins of 

the Gulf of Cadiz and to train students  in how to conduct research in marine 

geoscience (Kenyon et al., 2006). Investigations were focused on mud volcanism,

fluid venting and related processes  in the Gulf of Cadiz. Gas  hydrates, carbonate 

crust and nodules, as well as  benthic chemosynthetic communities  were sampled 

from some of these structures (UNESCO, 2006). Large carbonate chimneys, 

related to fluid escape were sampled and recorded by a deep-towed video system 

on two small mounds on the main channel of the MOW in from of Gibraltar Strait

Cruise TTR 15 
TTR 15 cruise, Leg 4,was  carried out in 2005, onboard the RV Professor 

Logachev, as  part of the fifteenth Training-through-Research Cruise integrated in 

the framework of the MVSeis Euromargins  project and where researchers  from  the 

university of Aveiro had participate. The main objectives  of the TTR-15 Leg 4 were 

to investigate the structural control of the fluid escape structures in the Gulf of 

Cadiz and the associated fauna, in particular to investigate several mud volcanoes 

in the Moroccan sector of the Gulf of Cadiz, and investigate the possible 

continuation to the east and west of the southernmost known mud volcano field in 

the NW Moroccan margin (UNESCO, 2007). Other main objective of this  cruise 

was also the investigation, with geophysical methods  and coring, of several high 

backscatter features  observed in the available side-scan sonar imagery in the 

Figure 17. Onboard pictures of the samples collected on the stations 550D, 551D and 552Gr.

deep Portuguese sector of the Gulf of Cadiz. Some of these features have a 

corresponding bathymetric expression and need testing to ascertain if they are 

mud volcanoes (Akhmetzhanov et al., 2007).

A selected set of samples, representative of the different lithologies  collected in the 

stations 569Gr, 574D, 581Gr and 583G, as reported in table 2.

Cruise TTR 16
 The TTR 16 Leg 2, was part of the MVSEIS Euromargins Project, and was 

focused on two main areas: (1) the E. Moroccan Field, and (2) the Deep 

Portuguese Mud Volcano field. The main objectives of this  cruise were: (1) To 

investigate the Pen Duick Escarpment to better understand this complex feature 

and associated ecosystems. (2) To re-visit the Yuma and Ginsburg mud volcanoes 

for detailed studies. (3) To carry out detailed studies  in the deep Portuguese field 

(Akhmetzhanov et al., 2008). The TV controlled Grab TTR 16 – 600Gr was 

collected on the Pen Duick Escarpment and retrieved fragments of carbonate 

crusts together with coral and shell debris. From  this  sampling station, a 

representative authigenic carbonate sample was selected to this study (IV27).

(UNESCO, 2008).

Cruise METEOR 86/5 
METEOR 86/5 cruise, done onboard the RV Meteor in February and March 2012, 

had the objective of collect data from sites of fluid migration and escape to the

Figure 21: Core log and onboard picture of the gravity core TTR15 – 583G, from where the concre-
tions sample IV26, that was studied in this work, was collected from



transform  faults (SWIM faults), showed that mud volcano fluids are sourced in 

several km depth below the seafloor. The geochemical composition of the mud 

volcano fluids indicates  that they are affected by oceanic crust alteration, and 

hence implies  that there is active flow connecting the oceanic basement and the 

seafloor. Such kind of hydrothermal circulation is only known for relatively young 

oceanic crust (&lt;60 Ma). Because of the fact that “the existence of a hydrological 

connection between old, sedimented oceanic crust and the seafloor is a 

phenomenon, which essentially has not been investigated in the past, and may 

represent a (missing) link between hot vents  at mid-ocean ridges and cold seeps 

at continental margins” this cruise had the objective of investigate sites along the 

westward trending transform  faults (SWIM faults), mainly within the transition 

between the accretionary prism and the abyssal plain. As  the sediment cover 

generally decreases  to the west, the potential overprinting of the hydrothermal 

signal of seep fluids  by sediment alteration processes is  expected to be reduced

likewise (Hensen and scientific cruise party, cruise report, in prep., Magalhães, 

pers.Comm.;http://www.geomar.de/en/research/expeditionen/detail-view/exp//

314699/).

In this  cruise had the participation of several researchers from the University of 

Aveiro and sediment samples were collected and two samples were selected and 

studied in the framework of this  Master thesis. Authigenic carbonate samples  IV20 

and IV22 were collected from gravity cores: M86/5–24GC04 and M86/5–42GC10, 

respectively (ifgure 24). These gravity cores  retrieved sequences of mud volcano 

mud breccia and hemipelagic sediments on the Michael Ivanov mud volcano. To 

be noted that on this  mud volcano, another gravity core retrieved has  hydrates, 

indicating the present-day active state of this structure with methane rich-fluids  at 

the seafloor or very close to it. 

Sediments  from the top of the M.V. are formed by mud breccias, with clasts  up to 4 

cm  in diameter (M86/5-24GC04), mainly of claystone but also including other

lithologies, such as authigenic carbonate concretions, some of which were studied 

in this Master project (sample IV20). They present intense H2S smell, indicator of 

active anaerobic methane oxidation. The present-day active state of this structure 

is  is also reinforced by the presence of a 10x4x6 cm size gas hydrate chunk 

collected at shallow depth (65 to 76 cm  depth) in a gravity corer. The gas hydrate 

chunk has  a rounded shape, probably due to the melting of hydrate and 

subsequent formation of ice surrounding the hydrate, during the long time between 

recovery and sampling (Magalhães, pers. comm.). Core M86/5-42GC10, 

recovered at the northern crater of the mud volcano showed a sequence of silty 

clays and clays  and an intercalation of mud breccias  with very weak claystone 

clasts, partially dissolved into the matrix and several intervals  of high authigenic 

carbonate content, with a carbonate concretion of 12 cm in diameter at 370-380 

cm depth (sample IV22) that was studied in this Master project.

The samples  analyzed in this thesis coming from the four cruises described before 

includes both carbonates crusts  and chimneys  coming from the different areas  of 

interests of Gulf of Cadiz.

Chapter 5: Methods

For this  work, were selected representative samples of the different lithologies 

collected from: the small mounds  on the MOW channel in front of Gibraltar Strait, 

from the Vernadsky Ridge and the Pen Duick escarpment, and from  the Meknes, 

Mercator and Michael Ivanov mud volcanoes. These samples were described 

macroscopically and cutted along transversal and longitudinal sections. Thin 

sections of the representative lithologies  were prepared and their petrography 

described. On the concretions  samples, the preparation of thin sections was  not 

possible to be done due to the low cohesion of the samples. 

Powdered sub-samples were then collected by hand micro-drill along radial and 

longitudinal profiles on the transversal and longitudinal cuts  o fthe samples, and 

the collected powdered was  used for the x-ray diffraction mineralogy, total organic 

carbon, carbonate content, carbon and oxygen stable isotope analysis.

All the data obtained from the different analysis  have been interpreted and plots 

produced using three different programs: Microsoft Excel, R statistics(see Annex I) 

and GCDkit (GeoChemical Data kit) (see Annex II) that runs on the R platform.

5.1 Thin Sections

5.1.1 What is a geological thin section?

In many areas of geological studies  such as  mineralogy, petrography and 

sedimentology  thin section preparation is the most adequate mean to  examine 

microscopically samples of sediments, soil or rock samples. This  analysis is 

normally carried out using transmitted polarized light of thin sections  (of known 

and exact thickness) of the samples. Reflected light microscopy is also widely 

used for certain applications, in particular in the study of opaque minerals. This 

technique requires the surface of the sample to be flat and highly polished for the 

best results to be achieved. The increasing use of electron microscopes is  also 

contributing to the need for top quality thin sections of a wide range of materials.

5.1.2 Thin Section Preparation Systems

Traditionally, this time consuming and highly skilled process was  done by hand. 

58



Recently developed automatized mechanic methods  have revolutionized the 

process by introducing technology that automates  and simplifies the preparation of 

thin sections - all with improved quality results, and have the following advantages:

• consistently produces  high quality thin sections; 

• substantially increases thin section preparation output;

• virtually eliminate the need for hand lapping &amp;amp; polishing;

• allows the production of thin sections of variable dimensions.

Different types of thin sections and different protocols  and instruments to prepare 

thin sections are available. In this  work, standard rock thin sections not recovered 

by a glass  cover were produced. This  type of thin section allows the standard 

transmitted-light petrographic observation, and allows  posterior analyses  of the 

samples  by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cathodoluminscence 

microscopy and ion microprobe analyses.

5.2 X-ray diffraction

X-ray diffraction (XRD) is  a versatile, non-destructive technique that reveals 

detailed information about the chemical composition and crystallographic structure 

of natural and manufactured materials. On this master project, the bulk mineralogy 

and the relative abundance of different carbonate mineralogies  was  determined 

through X-ray diffraction (XRD) on 68 powdered sub-samples (table 3). X-ray 

diffraction patterns were obtained at the Laboratório de Raios-X of the 

Geosciences Department, using a Scintag X-ray diffractometer with CuK! 

radiation (1.5405 Å wavelength). Scans  were done from 5º to 60º 2" at 0.02º/sec, 

using 40 kV accelerating voltage and 30 mA current. As  the intensity of the 

diffraction pattern of a mineral in a mixture is proportional to its  concentration, 

estimates of the relative proportions of the minerals  in a sample were made by 

measuring their relative peak areas. Peak identification and minerals relative 

abundance estimation were performed using the MacDiff software package, as 

described above. The peak areas were measured for the main peaks of the 

59



carbonate minerals  aragonite (3.40 Å), calcite (&amp;lt;8 mol% MgCO3, 3.036 to 3.012 

Å), high-Mg calcite (8 to 30 mol% MgCO3, 3.012 to 2.946 Å), protodolomite (30 to 

40 mol% MgCO3, 2.946 to 2.916 Å) and dolomite (40 to 55 mol% MgCO3, 2.916 

to 2.871 Å). The Mg:Ca ratio of the carbonate minerals  was  calculated from  the 

shift of the d-spacing of the (104) reflection peak of calcite and dolomite from the 

stechoimetric peaks positions in the diffraction spectra (Goldsmith and Graf, 1958; 

Lumsden, 1979).

5.2.1 X-ray Generation and Properties

X-rays  are electromagnetic radiation with typical photon energies  in the range of 

100 eV - 100 keV. For diffraction applications, only short wavelength x-rays  (hard 

x-rays) in the range of a few angstroms  to 0.1 angstrom  (1 keV - 120 keV) are 

used. Because the wavelength of x-rays is comparable to the size of atoms, they 

are ideally suited for probing the structural arrangement of atoms and molecules in 

a wide range of materials. The energetic x-rays can penetrate deep into the 

materials and provide information about the bulk structure.

X-rays  are produced by either x-ray tubes  or synchrotron radiation. In a x-ray tube, 

source used in x-ray diffraction instruments, x-rays are generated when a focused 

electron beam, accelerated across a high voltage field, bombards  a stationary or a 

rotating solid target. As  electrons collide with atoms in the target and slow down, a 

continuous spectrum of x-rays  are emitted, which are termed Bremsstrahlung 

radiation. The high energy electrons  also eject inner shell electrons in atoms 

through the ionization process. When a free electron fills the shell, an x-ray photon 

with energy characteristic of the target material is  emitted. Common targets  used 

in x-ray tubes include Cu and Mo. In recent years  synchrotron facilities  have 

become widely used as preferred sources  for x-ray diffraction measurements. 

Synchrotron radiation is  emitted by electrons  or positrons  traveling at near light 

speed in a circular storage ring (Youli Li, 2002). 

5.2.2 Lattice Planes and Bragg's Law

When x-ray photons  collide with electrons in atoms, some photons  from the 

incident beam  will be deflected away from  the direction where they originally 

60



travel. If the wavelength of these scattered x-rays do not change in energy level, 

the process is called elastic scattering (Thompson Scattering) in that only 

momentum has been transferred in the scattering process. These are the x-rays 

that we measure in diffraction experiments, as the scattered x-rays  carry 

information about the electron distribution in materials. On the other hand, in the 

inelastic scattering process  (Compton Scattering), x-rays  transfer some of their 

energy to the electrons  and the scattered x-rays  will have a different wavelength 

than the incident x-rays. Diffracted waves from  different atoms can interfere with 

each other and the resultant intensity distribution is  strongly modulated by this 

interaction. If the atoms  are arranged in crystals, the diffracted waves will consist 

of sharp interference maxima (peaks) with the same symmetry as  in the 

distribution of atoms. Measuring the diffraction pattern therefore allows  us to 

deduce the distribution of atoms in a material.

The peaks in a x-ray diffraction pattern are directly related to the atomic 

distancesFor a given set of lattice planes  with an inter-plane distance of d, the 

condition for a diffraction (peak) to occur can be simply written as 2 d sin ! = n " 

which is  known as  the Bragg's  law. In the equation,l is  the wavelength of the x-ray, 

! the scattering angle, and " an integer representing the order of the diffraction 
peak. The Bragg's  Law is  one of most important laws used for interpreting x-ray 

diffraction data.

It is important to point out that although we have used atoms  as  scattering points 

in this example, Bragg's Law applies to scattering centers consisting of any 

periodic distribution of electron density. 

5.2.3 Powder Diffraction

Powder X-ray Diffraction (XRD) is perhaps the most widely used x-ray diffraction 

technique for characterizing materials. The sample is usually in a powdery form, 

consisting of fine grains  of the crystalline material to be studied. The technique is 

used also widely for studying particles  in liquid suspensions or polycrystalline 

solids  (bulk or thin film  materials). The term 'powder' really means  that the 

crystalline domains  are randomly oriented in the sample. The positions  and the 

61



intensities of the peaks are used for identifying the underlying structure (or phase) 

of the material. Powder diffraction data can be collected using either transmission 

or reflection geometry. The peak positions, intensities, widths  and shapes all 

provide important information about the structure of the material.

5.2.4 X-ray Crystallography

In particular in this thesis  is used the X-ray crystallography that is  a standard 

technique for solving crystal structures. In recent years, the advent of synchrotron 

radiation sources, area detector based data collection instruments, and high speed 

computers has dramatically enhanced the efficiency of crystallographic structural 

determination. In x-ray crystallography, integrated intensities  of the diffraction 

peaks are used to reconstruct the electron density map within the unit cell in the 

crystal. To achieve high accuracy in the reconstruction, which is  done by Fourier 

transforming the diffraction intensities with appropriate phase assignment, a high 

degree of completeness as well as redundancy in diffraction data is  necessary, 

meaning that all possible reflections  are measured multiple times to reduce 

systematic and statistical error (Youli Li, 2002).

5.2.5 MacDiff 4.2.6
In this  work, the diffractograms  obtained for each sample have been interpreted 

using the MacDiff 4.2.6 interpretation software. It is  a program  for the analysis and 

display of X-ray powder diffractograms running on Apple Macintosh platforms. It 

offers  conventional XRD profile-correction processes  (e.g. outliers, smoothing, 

divergence, alpha2-stripping) and supports  qualitative and quantitative mineral 

composition.  MacDiff also supports methods  of  peak fits and peak decomposition  

of coinciding lines. The user has at his  disposal the capability of continuous 

measurement checks and the possibility to perform corrections as well (e.g. by 

manual or computed back- ground adaptations). For peak indication the user has 

the option to employ variable peak data sets. High resolution hardcopies of the 

diffractograms  can be produced. Data and plots can be exported to most of the 

available table-processing or vector-graphics programs. The applications of 

MacDiff range from  routine analysis in sedimentology, especially clay minerals, 

over analysis of X-ray diffractograms of all types of rocks  and minerals  all the way 

62



to phase analysis of various crystalline substances.

MacDiff is a freeware software and is available together with the most minerals 

PDF databases, free of charge. It may be copied and distributed without 

restrictions  for non-profit and non-commercial use. (http://www.geol-pal.uni-

frankfurt.de/Staff/Homepages/Petschick/PDFs/MacDiff%20Manual%20E.pdf).

In this  Master project, MacDiff was  employed for the analysis  of all the 60 

difractograms on a Apple Macintosh platforms.

Interpretation steps

To have a correct interpretation of the difractograms, in this  work, I followed the 

sequence of processing and interpretation steps as described below.

After opening the file (on the top menu File---&gt;Open) the raw diffraction profile was 

smoothed, using the smooth counts function. It cleans the difractograms from the 

high frequency instrument noise and produces  clear and well defined the peaks. 

Then I computed the baseline through the show baseline command, it will 

calculates the baseline of the diffractogram that define the base of the peaks for 

63

Figure 25: MacDiff 4.0.4 screenshot. Example of visualization.



further area calculations.

After this step, I corrected the peaks position using has standard the Quartz, syn 

d=3.343. To do this, we plot the quartz profile using the Quartz (syn d=3.343) peak 

that naturally occurs in all the analyzed samples, as a standard. For this  step, we 

have to search on the minerals  database the quartz mineral record and plotted his 

profile on the diffractogram using the Draw command. Then identifying and 

selecting the diffractograms main peak of Quartz, we use the function “peak 

correction” in the menu Profile, it opens a selection windows  with the different 

options  of correction, where we select “quartz, d=3.343” peak correction. The 

program, based on the standard data selected, shift the entire diffractogram in 

order to adjust the selected quartz peak with his theoretical position. After his  step, 

we start with the interpretation of all the main peaks present, sequentially following 

their relative intensity importance. When all of the main peaks have been 

interpreted and all the minerals identified, we saved the interpreted file as  new 

file.rd and saved the interpretation and quantification report. This report stores  all 

the relevant information: mineral phase, main peak position, peak area, peak 

intensity and width at half of the high of the peak. This  data was then imported into 

a spreadsheet table and used to calculate the relative abundance of the different 

minerals, the magnesium content on calcite, Mg-calcite, protodolomite and 

dolomite minerals, as will be showed later.

5.3 Geochemistry

5.3.1 LECO C, O, N and S elemental analysis
The carbonate and the organic carbon were determined using a LECO CHNS-932 

elemental analyzer. Three replicates  of powdered and homogenized bulk material 

(2 mg), collected with a micro-drill, were analyzed per sub-sample. The same set 

of sub-samples was  later subjected to combustion for 8 h through a predefined 

stepwise increase in temperature up to 400ºC, to remove organic carbon, and re-

analyzed for inorganic carbon. The organic carbon content (Corg) was determined 

by the difference between total carbon and the inorganic carbon concentration. 

Results are presented in weight percent (wt%). The relative precision of repeated 

measurements of both samples and standards was 0.03 wt%.

64



5.3.2 Carbon and Oxygen Isotopes
The study of the isotopes  of carbon (13C/12C) and oxygen (18O/16O) permit to have 

important informations  about the paleoenvironmental conditions of the formation of 

the rocks. It can give information about the temperature, the conditions of 

formation and the different origins  of the chemicals and elements  that are being 

precipitated and form the rocks. Based on those informations  and on the results of 

the isotopic ratios, it is possible to classify the different carbonates  components 

and to correlate the different carbonate minerals with their formation conditions. 

The variations in the ratio of the isotopes, 18O/16O e 13C/12C, are calculated using 

an high precision mass spectrometer. The results are reported in the conventional 

! ‰  notation with reference to VPDB (Vienna Peedee Belemnite).The ! value is 

defined as  the per mil proportion of the isotopic ratio measurement of a sample 

over the isotopic ratio of a standard sample, according to the equation: 

A decrease of the ! values of the samples corresponds to an increase in the 

amount of light isotopes  (16 O and 12C) in relation to the standard. Otherwise an 

increase of the ! values of the samples means an increase in heavy isotopes (18O 

and 13C) in respect to the standard (Hudson 1977; Anderson &amp;amp;Arthur 1983; 

Marshall 1992; Corfield 1995, Fairchild et al. 1988). For example, a !18O value of 

+15‰ indicates that the sample is enriched in 18O by 15 parts  per thousand 

relative to the standard.

The !18O of a water carbonic precipitate depends  from  the composition of the 

carbonate and on the temperature of formation. Usually, negative !18O values  are 

associated with precipitation from low salinity fluids and with formation 

temperatures (Hudson 1977). 

The composition of !13C of carbonate precipitates reflect the different sources of 

bicarbonate dissolved in the water. These sources can include: sea water (!13C 

65



around 0 ‰), dissolution of carbonate skeletons (!13C around 0 ‰), alteration and 

dissolution processes  of the soil (!13C around -10 ‰), bacteria oxidation and 

sulfate reduction in organic matter (!13C around -25 ‰), bacteria methanogenic 

fermentation (!13C around +15 ‰), methane oxidation (!13C between -50 and -80 

‰), and abiotic reactions  associated with thermic fracturation and 

decarbossilization (!13C between -10 and -25 ‰) (Hudson, 1977; Irwin et al.,1977; 

Coleman, 1993; Mozley &amp;amp; Buns, 1993).

Therefore, carbonates that precipitates in isotopic equilibrium  (or almost in 

equilibrium) with their formation fluids   show  characteristic 18O and 13C 

compositions that reflect, in a reasonable way, their formation environment. 

However for skeleton types of carbonates  there are two potential problems  that 

have to be considered present: the vital effects and the possibility of a state of 

isotopic disequilibrium in the precipitation (Hudson 1977; Swart 1983).

In this  work, Carbon and Oxygen isotopic composition of the samples  were 

measured on the same powdered sub-samples  that were used for XRD and LECO 

analysis. The samples were analyzed at the MARUM Centre of the University of 

Bremen, in Germany. Samples for carbon and oxygen stable isotopic analyses 

were prepared by reacting at 90°C with 100% phosphoric acid on an automated 

carbonate device connected to a VG-PRISM mass  spectrometer calibrated with 

NBS19, NBS 18 and NBS 20. The results  are reported in the conventional ! ‰-

notation with reference to VPDB (Vienna Peedee Belemnite). Analytical 

reproducibility of the method, based on repeated standards  is  better than ±0.1‰ 

for both carbon and oxygen. For temperature calculations of the dolomite samples, 

dolomite !18O values were corrected for the analytical offset of +1.63‰, 

consequence of the unequal oxygen fractionation during the reaction to CO2 

(Rosenbaum and Sheppard, 1986).

5.4 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)

The scanning electron microscope (SEM) uses  a focused beam  of high-energy 

electrons  to generate a variety of signals  at the surface of solid specimens. The 

signals that derive from electron-sample interactions  reveal information about the 

66



sample including external morphology (texture), chemical composition, and 

crystalline structure and orientation of materials  making up the sample. In most 

applications, data are collected over a selected area of the surface of the sample, 

and a 2-dimensional image is generated that displays  spatial variations  in these 

properties. Areas ranging from  approximately 1 cm to 5 microns in width can be 

imaged in a scanning mode using conventional SEM techniques  (magnification 

ranging from  20X to approximately 30,000X, spatial resolution of 50 to 100 nm). 

The SEM is  also capable of performing analyses of selected point locations  on the 

sample; this  approach is especially useful in qualitatively or semi-quantitatively 

determining chemical compositions, crystalline structure, and crystal orientations.

5.4.1 Fundamental Principles of Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)

Accelerated electrons  in an SEM carry significant amounts of kinetic energy, and 

this  energy is  dissipated as  a variety of signals  produced by electron-sample 

interactions when the incident electrons  are decelerated in the solid sample. 

These signals include secondary electrons  (that produce SEM images), 

backscattered electrons  (BSE), diffracted backscattered electrons (EBSD that are 

used to determine crystal structures and orientations  of minerals), photons 

(characteristic X-rays that are used for elemental analysis  and continuum X-rays), 

visible light (cathodoluminescence or CL), and heat. Secondary electrons  and 

backscattered electrons  are commonly used for imaging samples: secondary 

electrons  are most valuable for showing morphology and topography on samples 

and backscattered electrons  are most valuable for illustrating contrasts  in 

composition in multiphase samples (i.e. for rapid phase discrimination). X-ray 

generation is produced by inelastic collisions  of the incident electrons  with 

electrons  in discrete ortitals  (shells) of atoms  in the sample. As the excited 

electrons  return to lower energy states, they yield X-rays that are of a fixed 

wavelength (that is  related to the difference in energy levels  of electrons  in 

different shells for a given element). Thus, characteristic X-rays are produced for 

each element in a mineral that is  "excited" by the electron beam. SEM analysis is 

considered to be "non-destructive"; that is, x-rays generated by electron 

interactions do not lead to volume loss  of the sample, so it is  possible to analyze 

67



the same materials repeatedly.

5.4.2 Applications

The SEM is routinely used to generate high-resolution images  of shapes of objects 

(SEI) and to show spatial variations in chemical compositions: 

1. acquiring elemental maps or spot chemical analyses using EDS,

2. discrimination of phases based on mean atomic number (commonly related to 

relative density) using BSE,

3. compositional maps based on differences  in trace element "activitors" using 

CL. 

The SEM is  also widely used to identify phases  based on qualitative chemical 

analysis and/or crystalline structure. Precise measurement of very small features 

and objects  down to 50 nm in size is also accomplished using the SEM. 

Backescattered electron images (BSE) can be used for rapid discrimination of 

phases  in multiphase samples. SEMs equipped with diffracted backscattered 

electron detectors  (EBSD) can be used to examine microfabric and 

crystallographic orientation in many materials.

In our case the SEM analysis should be performed on the thin sections.

Chapter 6: Results

6.1 Samples description

Based on the morphology, the macroscopic characteristics  and the mineralogy, the 

following three different types  of authigenic carbonates have been defined for the 

studied samples from the Gulf of Cadiz: chimneys, crusts and concretions.

6.1.1 Chimneys
The chimneys  have been characterized on their color, dimensions, morphologies, 

cohesion and bioturbation (Figure 26). Based on these parameters  the samples 

have been divided in two main groups. 

69

Figure 26: Examples of chimneys samples from TTR-14.



One group is  composed of chimney fragments, usually of brown-yellow-okra colors 

and more rarely with grayish colors. Those chimney fragments  of grayish colors 

present, in general, a low or mean cohesion level and at the touch are “sandy”, 

very porous  and have irregular morphologies. On these samples  the bioturbation 

is low or inexistent.

The second group is composed by pipe-like chimneys. The samples of this group 

show very dark-reddish colors  on the samples  exterior and have interiors of very 

light and yellowish colors. These color variations is  interpreted as  resulting from 

the oxidation of minerals  (such as  pyrite) due to the oxygenated seawater contact 

of the samples. This  process is  evident in some samples  that exhibit oxidation 

fronts spreading out from  the exterior of the sample and from  the open holes of 

burrows  where seawater was in contact with. The morphology of the chimneys is 

in general very constant and regular with pipe-like shape, in some of the cases. 

They are very well cemented, very consolidated and hard, also in the inner part. 

70

On this type of samples the levels  of bioturbation are very high, when compared 

with the chimney fragments  type. In some of the chimneys colonization of the 

exterior part of the chimney by different types of benthic fauna, is  frequent and 

sometimes, very densely colonized.

The dimensions of the chimneys are very variable, ranging from  a few centimeters 

up to 30-40 cm long and with diameters up to 30 cm. 

 6.1.2 Concretions
The concretions have all been collected from mud volcanoes. They consist in a 

semi consolidates  mud volcano mud breccias, cemented by carbonate minerals. 

They have a grey color, in general a lighter grey. The concretions  are not well 

consolidated and are in general very friable and are easily desegregated by hand 

or with a spatula. Concretions  have in general irregular or nodular shapes (Figure 

27b).

 6.1.3 Crusts
Carbonate crust samples  are very similar between them. They are grayish, very 

porous, and frequently show reddish intrusions or darker spots  (Figure 27a and 

27c). 

Once all the different samples  were described and all the typologies  defined, 

selected specimens representative of all the different lithologies  were further 

analyzed. Sub-samples  of the selected samples  were collected whenever changes 

in the composition, color, structure or texture were identified. Sub-samples were 

collected along transversal or radial cuts on the samples where slices  were 

collected for thin section preparation and petrographic microscopy observations 

and powdered sub-samples were collected with a hand micro-drill and further 

analyzed for x-ray diffraction mineralogy, total organic carbon and carbonate 

content, carbon and oxygen stable isotopic composition.

In the photos  of Figure 28 is  showed the location of the sub-samples drilling points 

of the chimneys  samples. The concretions  are homogeneous  so all the sub-

samples of each sample are representative of the entire sample.

6.2 Petrography

The petrographic observation and interpretation was  done on thin sections  of the 

chimneys  samples. The preparation of thin sections of the concretions  and crusts 

was technically very difficult, due to the low cohesion of the samples that were not 

able to be efficiently polish, and therefore these samples  were not described under 

the petrographic microscope.

• IV03_01: intramicrite, very homogeneous  texture, with a sandy matrix and very 

rare organic clasts  of shell fragments. The cement is micritic. Bioclasts of 

foraminifera and shell fragments (gastropods) are rare. 

• IV03_02: Very different texture than the observed in sample IV03_01, the matrix 

is  very dark, difficult to light penetration. It corresponds to a sparse bio-

micrite, wit abundant foraminifera bioclasts, higher than sample IV03_01, but 

not enough to define it as  a packed biomicrite. Detrital quartz grains  were 

identified as also some green and others yellow-reddish detrital grains. The 

bioclasts consist of foraminifera, gastropods and mollusk shell fragments.

• IV04_01: Texture corresponds to a wachestone with abundant detrital grains and 

some bio-clasts  inside a homogeneous micritic matrix, with slightly changes 

in color, from  orange to gray. Bioclasts are composed of foraminifera, shell 

fragments, gastropod, calcispheres and coccolitophoridae.

• IV04_02: Intramicrite to packed biomicrite texture with a lot of bioloclasts, with 

some pellets. High variety of detrital grains  of variable mineralogy. Bioclasts

include foraminifera, shell fragments, gastropod, coccolitophoridae, 

calcispheres and radiolarian.

• IV08_01: This  sample has non homogeneous  texture, ranging from  fossiliferous 

micrite to packed bio-micrite. Bioclasts, detrital grains are very abundant. The 

matrix is very fine and of dark brown color. Is possible to recognize changes 

in color and composition along the thin section, the matrix became gray and 

the texture became more uniform; probably those areas  result from intrusions 

of clayish material or result from  sediment bioturbation. Considering the 

detrital grains, they are both single minerals and poly-mineral rocks 

fragments. Several different crystalline detritals are observed. The bioclasts 

observed in this  thin section are foraminifera, coccolitophoridae, gastropods, 

shell fragments (bivalve), echinoderms.

• IV09_01: The texture of this sample is very similar to sample IV08_01. Has a 

variable texture, ranging from fossiliferous micrite to packed bio-micrite. It is 

possible to distinguish high amount and largely variable bioclasts, rock clasts, 

detrital minerals, in a brown-beige micritic matrix with sparse pelets. 

Speaking about the detrital minerals and rocks fragments, is  possible to 

observe in this  sample several different grains  of variable forms and colors: 

yellow, semi transparent, reddish, greenish, darkish particles  with 

homogeneous structures pellets  and probably remains  of organic matter, 

“filamentous” structure or crystalline polygonal structure. The observed 

bioclasts  include foraminifera, coccolitophoridae, gastropods, shell fragments 

(bivalve), calcispheres, radiolarians.

• IV10_01: Has a packed bio-micrite texture, with detrital grains, rock fragments 

and abundant bioclasts  in a micritic matrix. Different detrital grains  with 

variable forms  and colors  can be observed: yellow, semitransparent, reddish, 

greenish, darkish particles  with homogeneous  structures, “filamentous” 

structure or crystalline polygonal grains. The bioclasts are of foraminifera, 

coccolithophores, gastropods, shell fragments and radiolarian.

75



• IV11_01: The texture is very variable, not uniform along the thin section, ranging 

from packed bio-micrite to fossiliferous micrite and intramicrite. The detrital 

grains  are variable in composition and abundance, such as the bioclasts. The 

matrix if very fine (micritic) with a dark brown color. Is possible to see in 

various  parts of the thin section that the matrix  changes in color and 

composition, locally becomes grayish; probably those areas  are result from 

clay intrusions  or from bioturbation. Considering the detrital grains  and the 

rocks  fragments, it is  possible to observe in this sample several distinct grain 

shapes  and compositions: yellow, semi transparent, greenish, darkish gains 

with homogeneous  structures, “filamentous” structure or very angular shapes. 

The bioclasts are composed of foraminifera, coccolitophoridae, gastropods, 

shell fragments (bivalve). 

• IV14_01: This sample has a packed bio-micritic texture, and the detrital grains 

are composed predominantly by rock fragments  and mono-mineral detrital 

grains. The clasts have a high grain size than the previous  samples. The matrix 

is  micritic, of dark color, with some pellets  and probably remains of organic

• IV16_01: This sample has a packed bio-micrite texture; clasts are almost entirely 

composed of bioclasts. The matrix of this  sample is  micritic, variable in color, 

ranging from grayish to brownish and dark colors. Bioclasts are composed of  

foraminifera tests, coccolitophoridae, gastropods, shell fragments  (bivalve), 

radiolarian, algae residuals, spicules, Bryozoa. 

• IV19_01: The texture is  ranges from  intramicrite up to a packed bio-micrite 

texture. In most area of the thin section predominates the presence of 

angular detrital grains of rocks  fragments  and mono-mineral detrital clasts. In 

other areas of the thin section bioclasts, mainly foraminifera tests, 

predominate. The matrix is micritic and of brownish-dark color. 

All the samples have a significant porosity. Different types of porosity can be 

distinguished, from intra granular to inter granular porosity.

Most of the samples exhibit evidences  of the initial phases  of typical diagenesis 

process such as  grain compaction, the recrystallization of foraminifera tests in the

6.3 XRD

6.3.1 Total Mineral Composition
All the results  of XRD has been elaborated and interpreted using the software 

MacDiff. In figure 33 is possible illustrated to see an example of the MacDiff 

interpretation window of the diffractograms  that has  been done to have the results 

illustrated. The data obtained from  MacDiff has  been elaborated imported and 

analyzed with Excel spreadsheet and plotted in R to obtain comparative data.

6.3.1.1 Chimneys

From  the mineralogy analyzed with the XRD is  possible to notice that, the three 

types  of carbonates defined based on their morphology and macroscopic 

characterization are also well recognizable characterized by a distinct mineralogy.

As show in figure 34 with the box plots graphs, the chimneys show, in the major 

part in general, high level abundance of dolomite with a range between 20% and 

78

72.70%, just one sub-sample has a value that is  very low: IV04.06 measures 

7.11% (table 3 and figure 34). The calcite percentage has  a bigger larger variability 

range than the dolomite, in fact it goes  from  5.73 to 50.09% (table 3 and figure 34). 

81

minimum, maximum median and lower and upper quartiles for a variable. The box represents 
the interquartile range  that contains 50% of values. The whiskers are lines or points that extend 
from the box to the highest and lowest values. A line  across the box indicate  the median. The 
number of sub samples used in the statistic elaboration in reposted as n and calcite and  dolo-
mite are indicated by light and dark gray respectively.



For aragonite the chimneys doesn’t seems  to follow rules, we have only minor (&amp;lt;

10%) amounts  of aragonite on 8 samples, with aragonite ranginge between 1.49 

and 9.8%. is  always lower than the other two carbonate minerals in the chimneys 

(table 3 and figure 34). The detrital fraction are of course, depending from  the 

carbonate content; the and it ranges  is  between 90% and 26.82% (table 3 and 

figure 34). The sample with 90%, IV04.06, is  the one that has just a very low 

amount of carbonate (7.11%) and is the lower value. Instead the higher value of 

carbonates amount is 73%.  

The detrital fraction in the chimneys  is  composed mainly by quartz. Other minerals 

present often in this  type of carbonates are include clay minerals, feldspar, 

plagioclase, illite and phyllosilicates.

The anomaly low carbonate content of represent by the samples IV04.06, can be 

hypothesized is interpreted as  resulting from the nature of this  sample. S it 

corresponds to material that is infilling a borrow channel it does  not correspond to 

the normal carbonate lithology but instead it corresponds to material that resulted 

from the metabolic activity of the borrowing organism  and from sedimentary and 

digested material of the carbonate rock itself. Moreover, the LECO carbon content 

of this  sub-sample (figure 34) shows higher inorganic carbon content that has not 

a crystallographic structure, indicating most probably an organic origin. A are due 

to the instrument: in fact, as explained in the previous chapter, the XRD read the 

crystalline formation of carbonate, so probably this  sub-sample (that is an 

intrusion, as  you can see in figure 28) has carbon inside but not in a an crystallized 

organized form.

6.3.1.2 Concretions

The concretions  have a different type of composition: the carbonate fraction is 

always  composed by aragonite, calcite and dolomite, but the percentage 

composition is different. In these samples, the aragonite is  almost not present: just 

two sub-samples, IV20.06 and IV22.07, present it and only in a very low 

percentages, 0.32% and 0.40% respectively.

The dolomite is  more present but only in vestigial amounts  than calcite but 

however the range is very small, just ranging between 0.45% and 0.90%. The 

major carbonate mineral present in the concretion is  calcite, with the values that 

82



range for this mineral are between 23% and 73%. 

Four sub-samples (IV20.03 IV20.04 IV22.05 and IV22.06) have only they show 

just calcite as in the carbonate fraction, IV20.03 IV20.04 IV22.05 and IV22.06. The 

detrital fraction is  related with the carbonate fraction and the ranges between 

values  are 25.62% and 75.74%. This fraction is  composed mainly by quartz and 

clay minerals, but also pyroxens and phyllosilicates.

6.3.1.3 Crusts

The particularity distinctive feature of the crusts composition is  the presence of 

aragonite presence, as  is possible to see in figure 36. This  mineral is present in 

almost all the sub-samples, the values are very variables between 36.56% and 

0.57%. The range of the calcite abundance varies are between 76.89% and 

11.31%, the sub-sample IV27.08 is  composed, in the carbonate fraction, only by 

this  mineral. The dolomite fraction has  a range of values  between 10.18% and 

80.59%; there is a sub-sample, the IV25.03, that is  totally composed by this 

carbonate mineral. 

The detrital fraction also has  a similar range of values, between 9.07% and 

50.71%. This fraction is  mainly composed by quartz clay and in almost all the 

samples  is  present pyrite or simile other similar sulphur minerals  or their 

correspondent oxidized minerals  composed such as  by iron oxides. Are also

presents pyroxens in some sub samples.

6.3.2 Carbonate Content

The carbonate content can be estimated by XRD but the precision of on the 

mineral quantification by XRD is  in the order of 10%, therefore to quantify the 

carbonate content and to evaluate the precision of the XRD minerals  quantification 

the samples  were quantified by chemical analysis by LECO. Results  (table 3 and 

figure 38) show normal or expected differences between the LECO and the XRD 

quantifications. These differences  result from  the different precision of these 

analysis but also due to the fact that the XRD measures  the carbonate or mineral 

content by the crystallinity of their structure, while the LECO measures  the 

chemical abundance of elements such as  carbon. The difference accepted usually 

between the methods is  lower than 15%. In the samples  analyzed in this  thesis,

we have noticed that usually the quantifications with XRD give lower values than 

the quantifications with LECO (figures 39 and 40).

The samples  are almost all in the range of tolerance of 10 to 15%. Only the sub-

sample IV04.06 has  a very large difference between the two methods: the 

carbonate in XRD is  7.11% and 54.42% with LECO. This difference can be 

explained by the methods  himself. In fact looking at the figure 28 this sub-sample 

coincide to the white intrusion, this  can be formed by carbon and carbonate 

content that are not in a crystalline form, so it is  measured by LECO but not by

XRD.

The total carbonate fraction of the chimneys determined with XRD have values 

ranging from 49.57% to 73.18%, not considering the sample IV04.06, as  described 

before. The total carbonate fraction determined by LECO show values between 

54.42% and 77.78%. In the concretions  the carbonate content determined with 

XRD range between 24.26% and 73.38% while for LECO shows a variation 

between 17.64% and 73.67%.

The crusts also have similar variations in the total carbonate content: for XRD 

values  range from  49.29% up to 90.61% and for LECO ranges  between 57.91% 

and 89.74%.

In figure 38, that describe the correlations  between TOC (Total Organic Carbon) 

and the total carbonate fraction in the LECO measurement, in possible to see that 

all the samples follow a linear correlation and that only one sample seems  to be 

very different from the others. This  abnormal sub-sample (IV22.04) corresponds to 

a concretion that has  a very low value of total carbonate content when compared 

with the other samples  and an abnormal high detrital and clay fraction, indicating a 

very low cementation degree and therefore a very low amount of authigenic 

carbonate phases and for this reason has a very low content of carbon.

As shown in figure 38, the correlation between the XRD and LECO total carbonate 

fraction quantifications, it is possible to notice that two samples  deviate from  the 

linear correlation of these variables. These two abnormal sub-samples correspond 

to the concretion IV22.04 described above and the chimney sub-sample IV04.06 

that corresponds to the burrow channel infill, described above in this section.

6.4 Isotopes

Carbon (!13C) and oxygen (!18O) isotopic compositions  of the samples (For the 

isotopes  results, table 3 and figure 41) shows  the correlation between !18O and 

!13C for of the three groups of samples (chimneys, crusts and concretions) show a 

significant variability. While the Is possible to notice that, for !18O values show a 

constancy of the values, there aren’t big anomalies, all the samples are in a range 

between 2.482‰ (VPDB) and 5.976‰ (VPDB). Looking at the !13C values  show  

87



is possible to see a very large high variability, from -47.47 up to + 1.46‰ VPDB.

To be noted that the different carbonate types show partly overlapping but 

distinctive compositional domains. The concretions  show the more negative !13C 

values  ranging between -29.54 and -47‰ VPDB and !18O values with low 

variability (of about 4‰ VPDB). The crusts have intermediate !13C values (when 

compared with the other carbonate types) varying from  -16.75 and -27.08‰ 

VPDB, corresponding to a narrow variability. Considering the oxygen isotopes 

composition, the crusts  have a larger range of values, varying from 2.13 and 

5.23‰ VPDB. The chimneys show highly variable !13C values, from about 

-21.92‰ VPDB up to +1.46‰ VPDB. The oxygen isotopic composition of the 

chimneys  also show a significant variability, ranging from 2.48‰ up to 5.97‰ 

VPDB. On the !13C - !18O domain the chimneys indicate a linear compositional 

trend resembles  a system  with a mixture of two end members: one corresponding 

to negative carbon isotopic values  and the second end-member with isotopic 

compositions with close to zero !13C values  and about 2‰ !18O values. These two 

compositional end-members would correspond to methane rich fluids and the 

normal seawater. Therefor it can be interpreted that the chimneys  would indicate a 

formation from pore waters representing a mixture of methane rich fluids  and 

88

Figure 41: !18O vs !13C for the three types of samples. The values of the isotopes (VPDB) are 
expressed in ‰. 



normal seawater. The concretions would represent a formation from  fluids clearly 

enriched in methane while the crusts  point to methane enriched source fluids but 

with an intermediate composition. Some chimneys  sub-samples show abnormal 

compositions, corresponding to a non-methane-derived source: there are, at list, 

four anomaly samples. Two of these sub-samples are from  the chimneys group 

and are the (IV04.06 with a !13C value of -0.60‰ (VPDB) and IV16.02 with a !13C 

value of 1.46‰ (VPDB), that already resulted out of the ranges for the other 

analysis, and IV16.02 that measure 1.46‰ (VPDB) correspond to a normal 

seawater source. This  is strange because, usually the methane derived authigenic 

carbonates values  for !13C are negatives. As shown in figure 28, these two sub-

samples  correspond to the infillings of borrowings and therefor is normal that this 

material have a non methane-derived formation process  and are instead 

composed by normal sediments and material resultant from the organic activity of 

the burrowing organism, as  already observed on the mineral content of these sub-

samples.

The other two sub-samples  with close to normal seawater !13C values  (IV08.02 

and IV08.03) are interpreted as being the result of a high detrital and a high 

bioclasts (that have seawater carbon isotopic values) contents.

Other seems outside of the area of major concentration, are concretions: IV22.06 

with a value of !13C of -47.47‰ (VPDB) and IV22.07 that measure -44.98‰ 

(VPDB). Otherwise, also if those two are particularly negatives, all the concretions 

shows levels  of !13C lower than chimneys  and crusts. Also is possible to notice 

that the graph show three distinct groups  of samples that coincide with the three 

types  of carbonates  considered in this master thesis. Looking at table 3 the range 

of values  for the three types  of carbonates  seem  to be ordered in three groups  on 

the basis  of !13C. Otherwise the ranges values  of !18O for the three types of 

carbonates are similar: between 2.48‰ (VPDB) and 5.97‰ (VPDB) for chimneys, 

between 3.78‰ (VPDB) and 5.23‰ (VPDB) for concretions  and between 2.13‰ 

(VPDB) and 5.23‰ (VPDB) for crusts. For !13C, instead, the ranges are very 

different. The values  in chimneys  goes from  1.46‰ (VPDB) to -21.92‰ (VPDB), in 

concretions maximum  and minimum  levels  are -29.54‰ (VPDB) and -47.47‰ 

(VPDB) and, in the end, for crusts  the interval is between -16.75‰ (VPDB) and 

89



-27.08‰ (VPDB).

Looking at the figure 42, that shows the oxygen isotope and the total carbonate 

fraction, is possible to see that only one sample (IV22.04) seems to be different 

from the others; this difference is not for on the isotopic values but is just for the 

carbonate content. This  sample, that as  said described before, in section 6.3, 

shows an abnormally low content of carbonate content fraction.  All the other 

samples  form a homogeneous  big group divided in two parts: one with concretions 

and chimneys  samples  and another (yellow triangles) with corresponding to the 

crusts. This division is only mainly resultant of the distinctive imposed by the 

carbonate content.

In the figure 43 is  showed the relationship between the main carbonate fractions 

mineralogy (such as  calcite, on the left, and dolomite, on in the graph on the right), 

and the !18O. For Dolomite, the crusts and the chimneys are mixed and it seems 

that the samples of this  two types  follow a linear correlation trend. Otherwise the 

concretions are almost all near the X-axes  as the dolomite content because the 

trend of dolomite is very low. 

For the calcite graph, things are most confused and is  not possible to recognize 

90

three type of samples.



any clear trend in it. The !13C isotopic compositions  show a larger variability and 

seem to better illustrate any changes in fluids compositions  from which the 

carbonate minerals were formed from. Unlike the !18O, the carbon isotope is more 

discriminating and, considering figure 44, the three groups are well defined along 

the axis X based on the C isotopic composition. The concretions are well divided 

from the crusts and the chimneys  than have overlapping compositional domains 

and, in part, mix.

This  picture shows also that the crusts  have a higher quantity amount of total 

carbonate fraction content when compared with respect to the other two carbonate 

types  of carbonates. Only one sample (IV22.04), a concretion, seems  to be 

different from the others, in relation respect to the total CaCO3 content. The other 

two samples  that are divided from the others  are (IV22.06 and IV22.07), are also 

concretions, but they are discriminated by the values of !13C values that are the 

more negative (-47.47‰ (VPDB) and -44.98‰ (VPDB) respectively).

The concretions seems to have more negative values  of !13C when compared with 

the crusts and the chimneys. In fact, it is  possible to distinguish the three groups 

considering !13C variation, independently from the carbonate content, on the 

horizontal curse: the more negatives values  correspond to the concretions. Than 

the crusts, even observing an overlapping with the chimneys, have intermediate 

!13C values also if the higher values of them  mix a bit with the lower ones for the 

91

XRD and the !18O isotope for the three type of samples.



chimneys; and in the end there are the chimneys that have heavier !13C 

compositions. Those samples  have one positive value for this isotope: 1.46‰ 

(VPDB) for the sub-sample IV16.02, as said before.

On figure 45, on the left side, is  shown the relationship between calcite content 

and !13C. Also in this  picture the three groups  are divided and clearly identifiable. 

The concretions show a dispersed pattern domain, than the crusts and in the 

chimneys, also if mix a bit, the patterns seam to indicate preferably distinct trends. 

The concretions are also well defined in a “vertical way”: in fact they show a high 

content of calcite and more negative of !13C values.

The chimneys, on the contrary, show the lower contents  of calcite and the higher 

values  of !13C. The crusts are in the middle between them  and represent an 

intermediary behavior. Again, is  notable IV22.04 with the lower levels  content of 

carbonate, and therefore the lower level content of calcite. There are five sub-

samples  that don’t have calcite and they are: IV04.06, IV10.02 and IV10.03 for the 

chimneys; and sub-samples IV25.01 and IV25.03, for the crusts.

On the right side panel of figure 45, is  showed the relationship between the 

dolomite fraction and the !13C composition. The dolomite content is very variable. 

Is possible to have a very clear distinction between two groups: the concretions, 

that have dolomite fraction contents near 0, and the crusts and chimneys in which 

the dolomite content is very variable. In the this case of this  graph it is not possible 

to define any distinction or trend between the two variables considered.

samples. In some graphs  samples there are gaps  due to difficulties  in the 

collection of the required powdered material or due to analytical errors  during the 

ICP-MS measurements and had to be repeated and the results are still to be 

received.  Anyway, analyzing all the profiles, it is  possible to notice that they are 

very distinct between them. In some sample, like IV04, IV16, IV22 or IV19, they 

seems to cross  each other and show inverse correlation between both isotopes. It 

means that as  one increase and the other decreases. Other samples, like IV10 or 

and IV13, the two isotopes  make the same bend; in other again they seems  to do 

the opposite, like in IV16 or IV22. Other samples do not show any clear and 

distinctive variation along his profiles, are just confusing.

Chapter 7: Discussion

7.1  Types of authigenic carbonates

Based on the morphology, macroscopic and petrographic characterization and 

mineralogy, the studied samples  can be classified in three different groups: (1) 

chimneis, (2) concretions, and (3) crusts. These have distinct and characteristic 

mineral compositions, as is possible to see in figure 37 in the Carbonate Mineral 

Composition ternary plot. The chimneys carbonate fraction is characterized by the 

predominance of dolomite. The concretions  carbonate fraction is  composed, 

almost exclusively, by calcite. The carbonate fraction of the crusts  shows a more 

variable composition with the mineralogy including usually, both aragonite, calcite 

and dolomite. It is  possible to identify as a distinctive characteristic of this  type of 

carbonate the presence and higher contents of aragonite. 

As illustrated in Figure 37, the Principal Detrital Components Vs Total Carbonate 

fraction, it is possible to observe that all the samples from the three types of 

carbonates are composed mainly by carbonate minerals, that as observed in the 

petrographic and isotopic composition, and the cement that lithifies a sediment 

detrital fraction is composed by quartz grains, clays, bioclasts  and other minor 

detrital grains  (feldspars, plagioclases, pyroxenes). The clay content is always 

minor that 10%. The Mg content on the calcite and dolomite minerals  (Table 3 and 

Figure 37), is determined by the positions of main peaks of the carbonate phases 

on the XRD difractograms after their correction based on the quartz peak as 

reference. Thin ternary plot indicate that the carbonate phases  (calcite and 

dolomite) have stoichiometric or close to stoichiometric compositions. No Mg-

calcite neither proto-dolomite are present. 

The carbon and oxygen isotopic composition of the studied samples also 

discriminate very clearly the three different types of carbonates (figure 41). It is 

possible to notice that the chimneys, concretions  and crusts  define three domains 

with some overlapping in the chimneys  and crusts domains. Concretions show 

more negative !13C values  and fairly constant !18O values. The chimneys show 

high variability on the !13C values  

96



7.2 Methane-derived origin of these carbonates

 

7.2.1 Fluids Nature: seawater and Methane

The inference of the isotopic composition of the carbon pool from the carbonate 

mineral one is  complex, because the mineral composition may reflect mixing from 

the different carbon sources. Fractionation of the carbon will also depend on the 

extent to which the different carbon reservoirs are oxidized. However, it is possible 

to estimate the !13C composition of the fluids that permit the authigenic 

carbonates precipitation from, and is possible at least identify the different carbon 

sources. 

The carbon isotopic composition of the studied samples: chimneys  (with the 

exception of the sub-samples IV04.06 and IV16.02), crusts  and concretions, 

indicate that they originated from  a moderate to extremely 13C-depleted reservoir, 

with some variable mixture with normal seawater 13C reservoir (especially in 

samples  IV08.02 and IV08.03). Therefore the C isotopic composition of these 

carbonates indicate a clear methane-derived origin of these authigenic 

carbonates.

For isotopic light carbon signature, two principal sources  can be considered: (1) 

decomposition of organic mater, that result in typical pore waters  !13C values of 

about -25‰ VPDB, and (2) methane and higher hydrocarbons  oxidation products 

(Claypool and Kaplan, 1974; Rosenfeld and Silverman, 1959) that produces  pore 

waters !13C values of less  than -20‰ VPDB (-20‰ up to -110‰ VPDB). In the 

Gulf of Cadiz two potential sources  of methane can be considered: thermogenic 

and biogenic origin (Hensen et al., 2007; Niemann et al., 2006; Nuzzo et al., 2007; 

Stadnitskaia et al., 2006). Typically, biogenic methane formed by CO2 reduction or 

by fermentative decomposition of organic matter by micro-organisms at shallow 

depths is extremely fractionated in 13C, typically with !13C values  between -50‰ 

and -110‰ VPDB (Claypool and Kaplan, 1974; Schoell, 1988) and thermogenic 

methane is  isotopic less fractionated ranging from  -50‰ to -20‰ VPDB (Schoell, 

1980, 1988).

97



Another potential important source of carbon to the total carbon pool from 

which these carbonates were precipitated is  the dissolved carbon from  normal 

seawater and HCO3-  derived from  dissolution of carbonate tests, both with !13C 

values  ~0‰ (VPDB). Given the petrographic characteristics of the chimneys and 

the crusts indicate a week diagenetic degree and therefore formation within 

shallow sediment column, and that in the case of the concretions were collected at 

80 cm and 250 cm depth bellow the seafloor. 

The studied samples have !13C values  heavier than biogenic methane, 

therefore mixing with of the several carbon sources  is  probable. Thus, it is  possible 

to propose that the authigenic carbonates most probably reflect a mixing of 

methane-rich fluids (thermogenic and biogenic methane) with non-methane carbon 

sources where seawater is the most important. 

!13C values  of the studied samples (figure 44) are typical from carbonates 

formed at methane vents  (Bohrmann et al., 1998; Greinert et al., 2001; Hovland et 

al., 1987; Kulm and Suess, 1990; Kulm  et al., 1986; Paull et al., 1992; Peckmann 

et al., 2001; Ritger et al., 1987) and correspond very well with methane-derived 

authigenic carbonates from other sites  in the Gulf of Cadiz (Magalhães, 2007 and 

Magalhães  et al., 2012), as  illustrated in figure 49. In this comparison with 

methane-derived authigenic carbonate samples from  other structures in the Gulf of 

Cadiz it is possible to notice that two sub-samples  from  chimneys  (IV04.06 and 

IV16.02) are very out of the normal expected depleted 13C values also reported in 

the literature as normal for MDAC. As discussed before, these sub-samples 

correspond to sedimentary infill’s  of burrows, being this  the reason for these 

abnormal values. Also the sub-samples  IV08.02 and IV08.03 present values of 

!13C very high -3.92‰ and -2.71‰ VPDB (Figure 49), close to the normal 

seawater composition (close to 0‰ VPDB). This is interpreted as being the result 

of the fact that sample IV08 present a very high level of bioturbation and bio-

erosion. In fact, as  illustrated in figure 28, this sample is  highly burrowed, has  high 

amount of remains  of tube worms, benthic organisms  attached to the burrow 

tunnels  that are very close to the drilling points. It means  that probably during the 

drilling procedure has been collected not only the carbonate rock material but also 

shell fragments or biological components  that altered the results, especially the 

98



isotopes.

From  figure 49 it is  possible to recognize also that the isotopic composition of 

other MDAC samples collected in other sites  of the Gulf of Cadiz (Magalhães, V. 

2007) show that the crusts (Dolomite crusts in the figure) have highly variable 

isotopic compositions, similar to the observed in the crusts  of this  study. Also, the 

chimneys are very similar to the chimney samples in this study. 

Relatively to the isotopic compositional variation within the individual samples, 

along radial and longitudinal profiles  on the crusts  and chimneys (figure 46, 47 and 

48) no clear and distinctive trend can be defined. As already mentioned in the 

results section, there are some samples  in which the two isotopes  seem to 

increase or decrease together, some other cases  in which the trend is  opposite 

and others in which is not clear.

On the other hand, relatively to the relationship between the isotopic composition 

and the carbonate fraction (total carbonate, dolomite and calcite) it is possible to 

recognize a linear good correlation for the chimneys. In fact, looking at figures  42 

and 44 is possible to define a general trend that is  very clear for chimneys 

samples: as the carbonate content (of the cement) increases, the !18O becomes 

heavier and the !13C becomes more negative. This  can be interpreted as reflecting 

99

Figure 49: !18O and !13C values of the samples used in this thesis (colored ones) compared with 
the isotopic composition of samples collected in other sites of the Gulf of Cadiz (Magalhães, et al., 
2012) plotted in black-gray color.

that as  methane-derives authigenic carbonates  are precipitated, increasing the 

cementation, these methane-derived isotopic signal (heavier !18O and depleted 

!13C) will also increase, compared with the normal seawater signal (!18O and !13C 

values  close to 0). This  global trend between these two end-members  is 

recognized on the chimney samples but is not observed along each individual 

sample. On the crusts and concretions this  process of mixture is not recognized, 

possibly the number of analyzed samples is not sufficient to show this process.

 7.2.2 Anaerobic oxidation of methane

The textural characteristics  of the samples, corresponding to a formation within the 

sedimentary column, but with a low diagenetic degree, with the presence of pyrite, 

identified by XRD, and the recollection of the concretions at shallow sedimentary 

depths, indicates  that these carbonates were formed within the sediments but 

below the zone of oxic diagenesis, in an anoxic environment. This  implies 

anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) via sulphate reduction (SR) as  typical in 

the methane-derived authigenic carbonates. Therefore, we can consider that these 

samples  are formed as  consequence of the upward migration of methane rich 

fluids, probably with minor amounts of reduced carbon-compounds, and the 

anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) in the Sulphate Reduction Zone (SRZ), 

according to the microbially mediated (Boetius et al., 2000) net chemical reaction 

(Reeburgh, 1980):

                           CH4 + SO 4 2- " HCO3 - + HS - + H2O

As the AOM increases the alkalinity of the pore fluids and isotopic light methane 

carbon is  converted to bicarbonate, aragonite, Mg-calcite and dolomite, with light 

carbon isotopic ratio precipitates  cementing the pore spaces  of shallow sediments 

and their lithification, forming therefore these carbonate samples. Sulphide, that is 

another product of the coupling AOM + SR will be precipitated as  pyrite, dissolved 

in the seawater and an important amount of it will be consumed by sulphide-based 

communities.

100



7.3 Relative formation ages

In relation to the formation ages  of the different types of MDAC it is possible to 

distinguish the concretions  from  the chimneys and crusts. The concretions, as 

were sampled in situ through gravity coring, at 80 and 250 cm  depth bellow the 

seafloor, the petrographic characteristics, with high porosity, absent of oxidized 

minerals (no iron oxides present) and the presence of pyrite, indicates  a very 

recent or present-day formation. This  is also supported by the pore water 

geochemical data, where the methane and sulfate profiles  indicate these depths 

(80 and 250 cm depth bellow the seafloor) correspond to the present-day zone of 

sulfate-methane transition zone (Magalhães, pers. comm), therefore the zone 

where AOM-SR is more intense and the precipitation of MDAC is  expected to 

occur more intensely. On the other hand, the petrographic and mineralogical 

characteristics  of the crusts and chimneys, with high oxidized minerals (oxy-

hydroxide minerals), absence of pyrite or other sulfate minerals indicate the 

contact of these samples  with the oxidizing seawater after being formed within the 

sedimentary column. This is  also supported by the intense colonization of the 

samples  by benthic fauna and their intense burrowing. Therefore the crusts and 

chimneys  correspond to older MDAC than the concretions. The crusts and 

chimney samples  after being formed within the sedimentary column, would have to 

be exhumed from  the sedimentary column, most probably due to the strong 

erosive effect of the sea bottom  currents  of the MOW that flows  at the sites  (MOW 

channel in front of the Gibraltar Strait, the Vernadsky ridge, the Pen Duick 

escarpment, the Mercator and Meknes mud volcanoes) where these samples 

were collected from.

The samples IV22.06 and IV22.07 have been recovered in a core on top of the 

Michael Ivanov Mud Volcano. This  two sub-samples  present the lower levels  of 

!13C, respectively -47.47‰ (VPDB) and -44.98‰ (VPDB). This  can be related to 

the fact that near the sampling point, has been proved and investigate, during the 

M86/5 cruise, the presence of gas hydrates. 

101



 7.4 Formation model

The data collected permit to make some hypothesis on the formation processes of 

these different types of carbonate. 

The chimneys and crusts, according to the formation model proposed by 

Magalhães  (2007), are the result of expulsion of methane rich fluids along 

pathways  of fluid circulation and escape, formed by (hydraulic) fracturing or along 

sedimentary discontinuities  such as borrows. In fact if chimneys  and crusts  had 

formed above the seafloor, by upward growth of carbonates, in the same way of 

sulfide chimneys  in hydrothermal vents, they should contain a very small or none 

detrital fraction, facts not supported by the petrographic observations of these 

thesis samples, where the detrital faction composes a very significant fraction of 

the rock (usually about 50%). For the chimneys, considering their morphology, the 

degree of oxidation, the colonization and bioturbation by the benthic fauna, usually 

happen after the chimneys  are cropped out. Therefore the chimneys  with a more 

intense oxidation degree have been exposed to the seawater for longer periods of 

time and correspond to samples exhumed from shallower depths  in the sediment 

column. In contrast, the ones without or with only weak oxidation signs and 

bioturbation have had a shorter period of exposure to the seawater and 

correspond to a formation deeper inside the sediment column. In general the 

dolomite crusts correspond to cemented sedimentary layers while the dolomite 

chimneys correspond to cemented fluid conduits.

Sediments  with low permeability, like clay rich sediments will develop open vent 

channel chimneys  and show lighter !13C and heavier !18O. Sediments with high 

permeability will develop chimneys  with closed vent channels and sometimes  with 

concentric growth structures. The different concentric rings can reflect different 

episodes of venting with different intensities and different fluid compositions, or 

mixing fronts between the methane rich fluid and the seawater pore water.

In sites  of higher flux of methane-rich fluids, migrating from  deeper parts of the 

basin through the sediments, like occurs at the mud volcanoes, under anoxic but 

seawater ventilated environmental conditions (high sulfate concentrations), 

authigenic precipitation is  dominated by aragonite and calcite. This  is  the formation 

102



environment proposed for the crusts considered here. 

Concretions are different: they show a main composition by calcite and very low 

level of dolomite (&lt;1%), aragonite appear just in two sub-samples  (IV20.06 and 

IV22.07). In this case, the range of the carbon isotopic composition varies between 

-29.54‰ and -47.47‰ VPDB. This characteristics fit very well with the MDAC 

concretions described by Greinet et al., 2001; Lein, 2004 and Magalhães et al., 

2012.  Relatively to the oxygen isotopic composition, the concretions  described in 

this  study, that were collected from the Michael Ivanov mud volcano show a 

significant enrichment in the heavier oxygen isotope. This enrichment can be 

explained with the presence of gas hydrates during the formation of these MDAC 

sample type. In fact, during the R/V Meteor cruise M86/5 gas hydrates  were found 

and recollected from the Michael Ivanov mud volcano at depths of 80 cm bellow 

the seafloor. The concretions analyzed in this thesis  can therefore be interpreted 

as having a formation related with the presence of gas hydrates.

It was  also possible to notice that, relatively to the chimney samples  analyzed in 

this  work and comparing in with published results from  other samples in the Gulf of 

Cadiz, the one from  this work seem to cover a different range of !13C 

compositional values. In fact, the samples  reported from Magalhães et al. (2012) 

show a range of !13C ranging between -30‰ and -60‰ VPDB, while our samples 

have values  between -10‰ and -25‰ VPDB. Therefore it have been proposed 

four hypothesis that can explain this difference:

• The chimney samples  reported in this study presents  different sources areas 

than the previously reported in the Gulf of Cadiz (Magalhães et al., 2012). 

therefore these samples can reflect different gas compositions;

• The chimney samples analyzed in this thesis may represent a higher seawater 

influence with corresponding !13C values closer to 0 VPDB;

• The chimney samples reported in this study may exhibit late diagenetic 

alterations that have modified the !13C values

• Alternatively, the detrital minerals of the sediments, that are cemented by MDAC 

precipitated, may have different compositions that significantly change the !13C 

values of the bulk sample to slightly heavier compositions.

103



Chapter 8: Conclusions 

In conclusion, in this  work were described, for the first time, authigenic carbonate 

samples  from  six sites  in the Gulf of Cadiz, for the first time in two of these sites. 

Results of this  study prove that all the authigenic carbonates  analyzed in this 

thesis are methane-derived (MDAC). The mineral composition and the isotopic 

values have permitted to divide the samples in three main types: 

1. Chimneys, tightly carbonate-cemented, medium light grey to light brown color 

sandstone/mudstones. Those are sub-divided into two groups based on their 

morphology, one reddish-brownish, with high bioturbation, high cohesion and 

very well cemented; the other group of chimneys has yellow-grayish okra colors, 

without bioturbation signs and with lower cohesion. These two groups  represent 

different intensities  of exposion of the chimney samples to the seawater after 

their exhumation from  the sediments in which they were formed. The formation 

of the chimneys is  associated with the methane-rich fluids  migration and escape 

into the top of the sedimentary column or into close to the sea bottom. In fact, 

the chimneys correspond to cemented fluids conducts. The mineralogy shows 

both calcite and dolomite minerals  as  main carbonate fraction, in some samples 

aragonite can be present in minor quantities  (&amp;lt;10%). The detrital fraction is, in 

general, high confirming the formation of these samples  below the seafloor, 

within the sediments. Oxygen and carbon isotopes are typical and prove their 

formation by anaerobic methane oxidation and their methane-derived origin.

2. Crusts  show both the three carbonate minerals: aragonite, calcite and dolomite, 

in variable percentages  and have a formation process  that is  similar with the 

described for the chimneys. The detrital fraction on the crusts  is  in general lower 

than on the chimneys so, the crusts have been formed in an environment in the 

sedimentary column with higher pore spaces  and therefore more superficial. 

The isotopic composition of the crusts is  in agreement with the formation model 

described by Magalhães et al. (2012). 

3. Concretions have a carbonate fraction dominated by calcite. The detrital content 

is  higher than on the crusts or the chimneys. Concretions  isotopic composition  

104



agree with the isotopic composition of MDAC samples  described in the 

literature. Comparing them  with the other types of the studied authigenic 

carbonates show an enrichment in !18O, due to the formation in the presence of 

gas hydrates (Greinet et al., 2001).  

These samples show a clear relationship between carbonate fraction and the 

isotopic composition: an increase in the carbonate content is correlated with a 

decrease in !13C values and an increase in !18O values. In particular, considering 

the two main carbonate minerals, calcite and dolomite, it is  possible to observe 

that an increase in the calcite content is  fallowed by a decrease in the !18O values 

and the opposite variation of the !13C values. Increases  of the dolomite content is 

followed by increases of the !18O  values and decreases in the !13C values.

The majority of the studied samples have a detrital content higher than  30%, this 

is  interpreted as indicating that the carbonate formation occurs within the 

sediments. The major components  of the detrital fraction correspond to typical 

hemipelagic sediments. The crusts and concretions have pyrite, arsenopyrite and 

other iron sulfide minerals indicating a formation in anoxic environments, near the 

SRZ. 

Improvements on the understanding of the methane-derived authigenic 

carbonates formation processes, especially in the case of the crusts, imply more 

analysis  and more studies  such as  petrographic characterization with 

cathodoluminescence methods, Scanning-Electron Microscopic studies and 

Strontium isotopic studies, that were not available in this project timeframe. Also, 

the investigation of the relationship between gas  hydrates and the formation of 

authigenic carbonates  in the Gulf of Cadiz should be pursuit, requiring the 

analyses of a larger number of concretion samples. 

A future development of this  work, including further analysis, is also important to 

understand if the observed differences  between the chimneys described in this 

work and the chimneys in the Gulf of Cadiz described in the literature are resulting 

from one of the hypothesis that have been proposed in this thesis.

Annex I

R Statistic Script 
I have used the follow procedure to make Box-plot Graphs using R statistics.

I. Convert the excel file with the data in a .txt (ex: iv04.txt)

II. Open R statistic and change the work spaces. To do that I went to “Misc” and select 
“change work directory”, then select the one that I need, in which I saved the .txt file.

III. Import the file in R with iv04&lt;-read.table("iv04.txt")

IV. Now  the file is imported to check it just wrote iv04 and enter the code;  should appear 
the table like in figure 34. 

V.   Now, if all the data are the correct ones, give the command to do a Boxplot graph 
with groups, this is important because it needed a division in the same samples 
between different minerals and fractions.

 The script is:        boxplot(iv04$V2 ~ iv04$V1)

 where V2 and V1 are the variable that R have to consider respectively on the X and

 Y axis. In this cases, the types of fractions on the horizontal axis and the values in % 
 on the vertical.

VI. Then just give the enter command and the plot appear in a separate window. 

VII. Go on “file”---&gt; “save as...” and save it. 

117



Annex II

GCD kit extension
The GCDkit is and extension of  R specific for the GeoChemical Data. In this master thesis 
has been used to elaborate the ternary plot for the mineralogy.

To graph a ternary plot in GCDkit:

I. Prepare a correct excel file, with the title of  each column just in the first row  and data 
start from the second. In this way the software read directly the different variables in 
the excel file.

II. click on “Data” then “load data files” and select your file.

III. than select the sheet where are your data and upload it in GCDkit.

IV. Now the table is uploaded. You can check it going of “data”---&gt; “show table”

V. Now, to plot different groups of  samples (in this case chimneys crusts and 
concretions) I have splitted data in group. Click on “Data holding” than “Set group 
by...” and in the end “...labels” , Now  press Enter and it should appear the list of 
parameters contained in the sheet. The parameter that I have used was  the “Type” 
column.

VI. Now  that the group are set click on “Plots” and then “ternary plot” and select from the 
list (it appear clicking the Enter button) the parameters that you want.

VII. Select all the samples and let it run and the ternary plot appear in a separate window.

I have also changed the colors  and the symbols  for the groups to have simplier reading 
plot. To do this:

I. Click on the menu “Plot editing” select “Symbols/Colours by group” and select “Show 
Available symbols” or “Show available colours” 

II. It will appear the list that shows the symbols and colours and a table to full-in with the 
groups in the first column (chimneys, concretions and crusts) and symbol and colour 
in the second and third.

III. Enter the identification number for symbols and colours in the table.

118 Nome resoconto



IV. Give the Enter command and close it. 

V. The plot is ready to be saved ( “File”---&gt;”Save as...”)
