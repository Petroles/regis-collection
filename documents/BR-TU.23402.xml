agradecimentos Aos amigos que transformaram uma dura caminhada em passeio, 
OBRIGADO! Não querendo destacar ninguém, porque cada um deve tirar o 
seu próprio crédito, agradeço: aos MECs pela partilha das primeiras 
experiências; aos que pertencem à melhor colheita, que pela união fizemos a 
força; ao MAL e às perdas de tinta nas respectivas canetas; aos que nunca 
deixaram o 2º ano, e que me ensinaram a jogar PES; e aos que a altas horas 
nocturnas trocam abraços e lições de vida. 
 
Obrigado “à galera” do surf por me terem levado, ensinado e pelas boas 
vibrações que vou trazendo comigo. 
 
O Departamento de Geociências da Universidade de Aveiro é sem dúvida um 
local especial. Este prazer de estar por aqui só existe porque há pessoas que 
trabalham e se esforçam todos os dias para dele fazerem o melhor! Um 
obrigado especial à D. Paula, à D. Graça e ao Sr. Graça por toda a ajuda que 
sempre me deram ao longo deste cinco anos.

Resumo 

 
No presente trabalho apresentam-se as vantagens da utilização de atributos 
sísmicos na interpretação de dados de sísmica de reflexão 3D e na 
identificação e caracterização de reservatórios de hidrocarbonetos. O trabalho 
prático necessário para a elaboração desta tese foi realizado durante um 
estágio de quatro meses na empresa de serviços para a indústria petrolífera, 
Schlumberger, em Paris, utilizando o software de interpretação sísmica e de 
modelação de reservatórios de hidrocarbonetos, Petrel 2008.1. Os atributos 
sísmicos podem ser considerados formas alternativas de visualizar os dados 
de sísmica de reflexão, que normalmente são representados em amplitude.  A 
sua utilização facilita o processo de interpretação sísmica, uma vez que 
permite aumentar a razão sinal-ruído, detectar descontinuidades, reforçar a 
continuidade dos reflectores sísmicos e evidenciar indicadores directos de 
hidrocarbonetos nos dados sísmicos originais. Os atributos sísmicos podem 
ainda ser usados para treinar processos de auto-aprendizagem utilizados em 
redes neuronais na predição da distribuição de facies numa área em estudo. 
De uma forma geral, a utilização de atributos sísmicos facilita a correlação 
entre os dados provenientes do método sísmico, dados de poços e a geologia 
da área em estudo. Neste trabalho foi utilizado um bloco migrado de sísmica 
de reflexão 3D, com aproximadamente 6000 km

2
, adquirido no deep-offshore 

da costa Oeste Africana. Para além de um teste individual dos atributos 
sísmicos disponíveis no Petrel 2008.1, esta tese incluí uma avaliação 
preliminar do potencial em hidrocarbonetos de um sistema de canais 
amalgamados identificado na área em estudo. A sua identificação, 
interpretação e caracterização foi possível com o recurso a atributos sísmicos 
que evidenciam a presença de falhas, ou outras descontinuidades, e de 
atributos sísmicos sensíveis a pequenas variações na litologia e à presença de 
fluídos nos poros das formações litológicas.

abstract 
 

 

In this work the advantages related to the use of seismic attributes in the 
interpretation of 3D seismic data and in the characterization of hydrocarbon 
reservoirs are discussed. A four months internship at Schlumberger, in Paris, 
using the Petrel 2008.1 “seismic-to-simulation” software provided the 
necessary data to perform the work described in this thesis. Seismic attributes 
are different ways to look at the original seismic data, which normally is 
displayed in amplitudes. Using seismic attributes during the seismic 
interpretation process allow a significant improvement in the signal-to-noise 
ratio, the automatic detection of discontinuities, the enhancement of seismic 
reflectors continuity and the enhancement of direct hydrocarbon indicators. In 
the self-learning process for neural networks, seismic attributes can be used as 
training data to predict facies distribution in the study area. Generally, seismic 
attributes provide a better correlation between the data provided by the seismic 
reflection method, well log data and the geology of the study area. In this work, 
a 3D migrated seismic cube was used, with an approximate area of 6000km

2
, 

acquired in the deep-water of West Africa. Besides an individual test of each 
attribute available in Petrel 2008.1, this thesis also includes a preliminary 
evaluation of the oil and gas potential of a system of stacked channels 
identified within the study area. The identification, interpretation and 
characterization of this potential hydrocarbon reservoir was possible using 
seismic attributes to enhance faults and other discontinuities, and by using 
seismic attributes sensitive to subtle lithological variations and the presence of 
fluids in the pore spaces of the lithological formations.

I.2. Schlumberger Limited 

 

Schlumberger Limited is the world’s biggest company providing oilfield services on 

technology, information solutions and integrated project management to 

costumers working worldwide in the oil and gas industry (www.slb.com (a)). 

 

The very beginning of Schlumberger was in 1912 when Conrad Schlumberger had 

the first avant-garde idea to map the land subsurface using electrical methods; this 

is currently considered the beginning of the electrical geophysics. 14 years later, in 

1926, and after his brother Marcel joined the business, they founded the Société 

de Prospection Electrique, the starting point for what is nowadays Schlumberger. 

They recorded the first electrical resistivity well log one year later, in France, and 

in 1929 the Schlumberger brothers logged the first well in the USA. 1934 

represents the beginning of Schlumberger Well Services, the antecedent of what 

is nowadays Schlumberger Well Surveying Corporation. In 1962, Schlumberger 

Limited entered in the New York Stock Exchange under the title of SLB and today

it is spread over several stock exchanges markets such as New York Stock 

Exchange, Euronext Paris, Euronext Amsterdam, London and SWX Swiss 

(www.slb.com (b)). 

 

At present, Schlumberger Limited is headed by Andrew Gould (Chairman and 

CEO

) and operates in nine oilfield segments (Figure 1): Artificial Lift, 

Schlumberger Completations, Data &amp;amp; Consulting Services, Drilling and 

Measurements, Integrated Project Management, Schlumberger Information 

Solutions, Well Services, Wireline and Testing Services. It and also offers 

solutions on high quality seismic acquisition and processing through 

WesternGeco. These segments are organized under Reservoir Characterization, 

Reservoir Production and Reservoir Management groups (Figure 1; www.slb.com 

(a); (c)). 

 

Since Conrad Schlumberger until present Schlumberger grew up and now is 

spread in more than 80 countries with more than 84 000 employees of over 140 

different nationalities, reflecting the company’s belief that “diversity spurs creativity 

and understanding of customers' needs”. Schlumberger also built 23 research and 

engineering facilities all over the world to develop cutting-edge technology in oil 

and gas industry leading to a better and faster response to customers’ wishes 

(www.slb.com (a)). 

 

Schlumberger Information Solutions, is one of the several segments of 

Schlumberger Limited, and provides services in software, information 

management and information technology infrastructure. Its main aim is to help the 

oil and gas companies to reduce exploration risks and costs, implementing 

effective and safety workflows from exploration to production phases 

(www.slb.com (c)).

I.3. Objectives of this thesis 

 

During the four months as a trainee at SIS, several main objectives, related with 

both scientific and professional/personal experiences were accomplished. 

 

During this period the author became familiar with the daily routine of an employee 

in a support team from a service company for the oil and gas industry, learned 

how to use the seismic interpretation and hydrocarbon reservoir modeling 

software, Petrel 2008.1 and applied it to a case study. The introduction to new 

concepts related to seismic data processing, seismic attributes, seismic 

interpretation of key seismic reflectors and the characterization and identification 

of potential hydrocarbon reservoirs were also initially proposed and these goals 

were achieved. 

 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs

The starting point for this work was to learn how to use the basics of Petrel 2008.1. 

To achieve this objective and as a basis for further studies, the author attended 

two Petrel training courses: Petrel Introduction Course, taught by Petrel Support 

Engineer Caroline Martinez, and Petrel Seismic Visualization and Interpretation 

Course, taught by Petrel Support Engineer Marianne Lenormand Berthome. 

 

After an introduction to the latest version of the software and to the new seismic 

related concepts, the main research work carried out concentrated, on the 

potential use of seismic attributes in Petrel 2008.1, for the recognition and 

characterization of hydrocarbon reservoirs areas, fracture patterns and seismic 

classification using artificial neural networks (ANN). These studies were performed 

on a previously processed 3D seismic cube (see Section I.4). 

 

I.4. Dataset and Methodology 

 

The dataset used for this work consisted of a 3D processed seismic cube acquired 

by WesternGeco in the ultra-deep offshore of the West African Margin. This 

seismic volume corresponds to an area of approximately 6000 km
2
, originally 

recorded in SEG-D format, with a record length of 9 seconds and a sampling 

interval of 2ms. The data processing flow included basic filtering, amplitude 

correction and pre-stack Kirchhoff migration. The processed 3D seismic cube was 

reformatted to SEG-Y format, the conventional file standard for data exchange 

between oil companies, resampled at 4ms, to reduce the SEG-Y file size, and 

cropped vertically at 2.3 seconds (Schlumberger, personal communication). 

 

From the resampled 3D seismic volume, a quick interpretation of the seabed 

(Figure 2) was performed, using Petrel’s 3D autotracking function over a coarse 

interpretation grid of inlines/crosslines. Various variance attribute volumes (see 

IV.3.3.5) with different parameters were also computed for the entire 6000 km
2
 

seismic survey, with the purpose to define potential hydrocarbon accumulations in 

the study area.

scale ranges from red, for minimum depth values, to purple, for maximum depth values. 

 

In order to reduce the time consumption for computing the various seismic 

attributes investigated, and also for an easier manipulation of the data and to 

liberate some of the system memory, the resampled seismic cube was cropped 

around an area of interest identified in several time-slices from the variance 

attribute volume (Figure 3).  

 

The delineated area has approximately 2450km
2
, with 2327 inlines and 3362 

crosslines (Figure 4) and it was the work base to test the application of various 

seismic attributes and to perform the prospect generation and advanced 

interpretation stages (see V.1 and V.2).

The adopted methodology for this work were: (1) to test the seismic attributes 

available in Petrel 2008.1, showing examples from different areas of the cropped 

cube that best characterize each of the attributes (Chapter IV); (2) to select and 

apply the best combination of seismic attributes for the identification and 

characterization of potential hydrocarbon plays (Chapter V).

I.5. Structure of this thesis 

 

The present thesis is divided into six main parts. The first chapter introduces the 

scope and objectives of this thesis, the dataset and methodology used and a small 

reference to Schlumberger Limited and Schlumberger Information Solutions. 

 

In the second chapter the seismic reflection method is briefly introduced, 

highlighting the importance of using 3D seismic data versus 2D seismic data. 

Basic seismic data processing steps and different methods for 3D seismic 

acquisition are also presented. 

 

Chapter three describes briefly available commercial software for seismic 

interpretation and geological modeling, in particular Petrel 2008.1. 

 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs

Chapter four discusses the theory behind seismic attributes and their use in Petrel 

2008.1. It starts with a small introductory text about seismic attributes and an 

historical overview of classification of seismic attributes. Finally, the available 

seismic attributes in Petrel 2008.1 are shown with examples from real data, 

complemented with the respective theoretical explanation. 

 

The fifth chapter reports the application of seismic attributes to a case study from 

the Western African margin. They are used to identify and characterize a potential 

hydrocarbon reservoir and define the associated fault pattern: this is normally 

designated in industry as prospect generation. Seismic attributes are then used as 

part of an advanced interpretation workflow which includes the interpretation of 

key seismic reflectors and their respective seismic attributes and seismic 

classification, based in artificial neural networks trained with computed seismic 

cubes from the original dataset. 

 

The final chapter consists of the presentation and discussion of the results 

obtained, and the main conclusions that can be drawn from this work, followed by 

a short description of future work.

Chapter II. 3D Seismic Reflection Data 

 

Seismic reflection data results from acquisition surveys carried out both onshore 

(on land) and offshore (in marine environments). Taking into account the recent 

discoveries of giant hydrocarbon reservoirs in particular off West Africa and Brazil, 

it is believed that most of the largest hydrocarbon plays yet to be found are located 

in the offshore and particular in the deep-offshore. As such, the seismic reflection 

method and acquisition survey geometries described in this chapter will be dealing 

only with marine acquisition. For a more comprehensive overview of the seismic 

method, the reader is referred to Sheriff and Geldart (1995) and Yilmaz (2001). 

 

II.1. The Seismic Reflection Method 

 

The seismic reflection method is, without doubt, the most used geophysical 

technique in the oil and gas industry, as a tool for looking for hydrocarbon 

reservoirs, due to its high resolution even for great depths (Gomes and Alves, 

2007). In fact, it can be considered that the success of oil and gas exploration and 

production industry is what it is nowadays due to the high quality of the seismic 

data acquired presently and its more accurate and better constrained 

interpretation (Alfaro et al., 2007). 

 

The seismic reflection method (or exploration seismology) is a remote-sensing 

technique which allows recording a “picture” of the subsurface with great accuracy, 

high resolution and great penetration, that can be used to map geologic features 

associated with a petroleum system (Mcquillin et al., 1984; Telford et al., 1990; 

Chopra and Marfurt, 2005). 

 

Exploration seismology is a descendent branch of earthquake seismology since 

both techniques are used to understand and infer the geology inside the Earth by 

applying the same wave propagation principles at different scales. In earthquake 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

10 

seismology the propagation of seismic energy originated from earthquakes 

(uncontrolled sources with unknown characteristics), to receivers spread all over 

the Earth, is investigated to determine the large scale Earth’s structure and assess 

the risks for populations associated with those events. Exploration seismology 

uses the same principles of wave propagation, mainly for compressional p-waves, 

which travel inside Earth’s layers, produced by an artificial controlled source of 

energy using short source-receivers offsets. Depending on the survey target, 

sources and receivers acquisition geometries are previously planned to maximize 

the imaging capacity of the seismic method for the targets under investigation 

(Telford et al., 1990). 

 

In seismic reflection data, the information about the subsurface geology, physical 

rock properties and layers attitude, is inferred from the reflected wave travel-time 

between the source and its arrival at the receivers. The two-way travel-time (TWT) 

is defined by the time taken for the seismic waves to travel down from the source 

until they meet a boundary between layers with a different seismic velocity (V), 

density (?) and acoustic impedance (Z; Equation (1)) where they are reflected and 

then return to the surface. The contrast between acoustic impedance is called 

reflection coefficient (RC; Equation (2)).  

At such interfaces, the seismic rays are partially refracted, partially transmitted and 

partially reflected back to the surface where they are detected by a group of 

receivers (Figure 6). The arrival of reflected seismic waves produces systematic 

variations from trace to trace. These variations are called seismic events, and if 

they are consistent in the recorded seismic data, they can probably be interpreted 

as real geological interfaces between layers with different reflection coefficients. 

Measuring the travel-time of the events allow to determine the attitude and location 

of the geological interfaces which gave rise to each reflection event. The 

interpretation process also takes into account amplitude, frequency, phase and 

wave shape variations. Besides trying to identify direct hydrocarbon indicators, 

 Eq. (1) 

 Eq. (2)

seismic data is most often used to identify potential structures for hydrocarbon 

accumulation - traps
2
 (Telford et al., 1990; Gomes and Alves, 1997). 

 

 

Figure 6 – Diagram showing the path of the reflected seismic energy in one dimension as it travels 
from the source to the receivers and it is reflected from the interface between two layers with 
different acoustic impedances. 

 

Despite of the planned geometry, the acquisition environment and the type of 

seismic acquisition (2D or 3D), receivers are disposed along a line, or along 

parallel lines with more than one receiver line acquiring at the same time. A 

seismic acquisition survey is always composed of: (a) an input source; (b) groups 

of receivers, which detect the reflected seismic energy (the output of the Earth) 

and transform it into an electrical signal. Depending on the type of acquisition, 

receivers are disposed along a line (2D) or along parallel lines with more than one 

receiver line acquiring at the same time (3D); (c) amplifiers, (d) filters (e) an 

analog-digital-converter (ADC) which converts the signal from analytical to digital, 

for recording (Figure 7; Telford et al., 1990, McQuillin et al., 1984).  

 

The input source produces a previously designed pulse of energy which meets, as 

close as possible, certain predefined requirements such as total energy, duration, 

frequency content and maximum amplitude. These parameters should be set 

respecting the commitment of enough Earth’s penetration, resolution, and good 

signal-to-noise ratio (McQuillin et al., 1984). Receivers should be precise enough 

to detect very small ground motion, due to wave propagation, and preserve the 

signal without adding noise.

 A trap is a component of a petroleum system described as a geologic feature appropriate for hydrocarbon 

accumulations and sealed by a relatively impermeable formation. Traps can be structural or stratigraphic (e.g. 
faults or reefs, respectively) (glossary.oilfield.slb.com (a))

Figure 7 - Schematic representation of a general seismic acquisition system. The signal is 
originated by the source, travels through the Earth and is received at the surface by a group of 
receivers. Then, the signal is sent to a digital recording system after being transformed by an 
analog-digital-converter. 

 

In marine surveys the most widely used seismic sources are airguns and the 

receivers are piezoelectric sensors designated hydrophones, which are distributed 

inside a tube filled with kerosene, called a streamer. All the acquisition equipment 

(sources and receivers) used in marine surveys is towed behind the seismic 

vessel (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). 

 

II.1.1.  Seismic Sources 

 

Airguns are impulsive methods that create seismic energy. An airgun is a 

cylindrical device which is filled with high pressured air that is suddenly released 

into the water generating a pressure pulse. Using an array of variable size airguns 

(Figure 8) rather than using a single airgun is nowadays the standard procedure in 

the oil and gas exploration industry; this method allows producing a signal that 

matches as close as possible the theoretical desired characteristics of the input 

source.  

 

An airgun is divided into four principal components, a solenoid valve, the upper 

and lower chamber, which determine the size of the gun, and a double ended 

piston (Figure 9). The power of the airgun depends on the amount of high 



Chapter II 3D Seismic Reflection Data 

13 

pressured air stored in the lower chamber which is released into the water when 

the gun is shot. 

 

 

Figure 8 - An array of airguns with different sizes (commons.wikimedia.org). 

 

The air is injected in the upper chamber, flows through the axial opening of the 

piston and is kept inside the lower chamber (Figure 9, on the left). When the gun is 

fired an electrical signal opens the solenoid valve, the high pressured air reaches 

the underside of the piston producing an upward force on it. This upward 

movement will open the lower chamber, and release the air into the water forming 

a bubble (Figure 9, right). The charging cycle starts again with the introduction of 

new high pressured air inside the upper chamber which will force the piston to 

move downward and restart the steps described above (McQuillin et al., 1984; 

Sheriff and Geldart, 1995, Telford et al., 1990). 

 

The biggest challenge in airguns is producing a seismic pulse as close as possible 

to a spike, because after the first bubble pulse, an undesired train of waves is 

normally created (McQuillin et al., 1984). This effect is called “bubble effect” and 

its origin is related to alternately moments of expansion and contraction of the air 

bubble formed by the shoot. This phenomenon will depend on the relationship 

between the pressured gas, the hydrostatic pressure of the surrounding water and 

the net force which accelerates the water outwards the bubble. When the 

hydrostatic pressure becomes larger than the gas pressure, the bubble originated 

from the shoot collapses and reduces its radius until the gas pressure inside the 

bubble reaches the water pressure, when the bubble starts to expand again. This 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

14 

oscillatory cycle will keep working until the bubble reaches the water surface. 

Every time a bubble collapses or expands it will produce new energy, interfering 

with the first and well designed source pulse, creating an oscillatory signal (Figure 

10; Telford et al., 1990). 

 

 

Figure 9 - Schematic representation of an airgun operation. When the gun is charged the lower 
chamber is filled with high pressured air (on the left). The airgun is then discharged by an electrical 
signal which opens the solenoid valve, allowing air to be released into the water while the piston 
moves upward producing a bubble of air (on the right) (modified from woodshole.er.usgs.gov). 

 

 

Figure 10 – Representation of the bubble effect. The radius of the produced bubble when the 
airgun is fired is continuously expanding and collapsing until it reaches the surface creating an 
undesired oscillatory signal (www.aug.geophys.ethz.ch). 



Chapter II 3D Seismic Reflection Data 

15 

Many of the acquisition seismic surveys use arrays of variable size airguns 

disposed in a special geometry and fired at different intervals to minimize the 

bubble effect. Synchronizing the firing time to align the first pressure peak will 

produce a cancelation of the oscillatory signal, producing a signal with frequency 

as close as possible to a spike pulse. Special types of airguns, called GI-guns 

were especially designed to minimize this effect (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). 

 

II.1.2.  Seismic Receivers 

 

Depending if the survey is carried on land or at sea, the receivers used are 

geophones or hydrophones, respectively. Standard hydrophones are piezoelectric 

sensors towed inside a streamer and transform the compressional p-waves into an 

electrical signal. Onshore, different kinds of geophones are used to detect p-

waves or s-waves, depending on the survey purpose, and are normally coupled to 

the ground along straight lines (McQuillin et al., 1984).  

 

A streamer (Figure 11) is a neoprene tube where hydrophones are placed by 

groups in regular intervals with a total length from 6 to 8km (Alfaro et al., 2007; 

Telford et al., 1989). The streamer is filled with a liquid lighter-than-water (e.g. 

kerosene) to turn it neutrally buoyant. Connection wires in between hydrophones 

and from the receiver to the recording system are also included inside the 

streamer (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995).  

 

A streamer is divided in several functional parts (Figure 12). The first component is 

a lead-in section which connects the vessel and the first group of hydrophones. 

This ensures the minimum interference from the vessel’s movement in the 

streamer. Hydrophones are arranged in sections called “live sections” and in each 

section there are twenty or more hydrophones spaced approximately 1m. In terms 

of seismic processing the signal received at each hydrophone inside a section is 

summed up and is considered just one receiver group (or channel). This technique 

improves the signal-to-noise ratio but when there is a great component of noise 

acquired with the signal, it can damage the quality of the data (Alfaro et al., 2007). 

“Dead sections” (Figure 12), i.e. sections without hydrophones, are placed 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

16 

between live sections to give the desired length and configuration to the streamer. 

The last section is followed by a tail buoy equipped with positioning tools that 

communicate with the vessel (Figure 12). The buoy is used both to calculate the 

positioning of the streamer and to reduce the drift of the streamer due to water 

currents. 

 

 

Figure 11 – A streamer being deployed into the water. When the vessel is not acquiring seismics, 
the streamer is kept onboard coiled on a reel (www.ig.utexas.edu). 

 

In intervals between channels hydrostatic pressure-based depth controllers, 

normally designated as “birds” are placed. These devices will induce a 

compensation against the upward or downward movements of the streamer to 

maintain it at a constant depth (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995; McQuillin, 1984). 

 

 

Figure 12 - Schematic representation of a streamer configuration (Modified from Sheriff and 
Geldart, 1995). 

 



Chapter II 3D Seismic Reflection Data 

17 

A stabilized streamer will reduce the noise content of the data and will ensure the 

right positioning of the group of channels, in depth and space, to be later corrected 

in the definition of the acquisition geometry, during the seismic data preprocessing 

stage (see Section II.4). In addition, the towing depth will also determine the 

frequency component of the received signal; if a streamer is towed at less than 8m 

depth than the sea surface, it will better preserve the high-frequency content of the 

signal but it will also increase the noise derived from weather and sea conditions. 

Increasing the towing depth value will preserve the low-frequency content of the 

signal and it will also increase the depth penetration. Traditional towing depths are 

from 8 to 12m (Alfaro et al., 2007). 

 

II.2. 2D Seismic Data versus 3D Seismic Data 

 

2D Seismic Data 

Two-dimensional seismic data is normally acquired along spaced straight lines at 

distances from each other that normally range from hundred of meters to several 

kilometers. In marine seismic surveys, a single seismic vessel is used with one 

airgun array and a single streamer. Theoretically the content of the 2D seismic 

data has only information about the subsurface vertically below the acquisition 

path. However, the received signal has contributions of reflections from points 

outside the acquisition path. In terms of comparison, two-dimensional seismic 

sections can be considered as cross-section of a seismic volume (Yilmaz, 2001b). 

 

In the current days and due to their low acquisition costs, 2D seismic surveys are 

the first exploration method used in oil and gas industry, where not enough 

knowledge about the subsurface exists. Regional surveys are carried out to 

identify potential large scale hydrocarbon accumulation sites and decide about 

further 3D surveys parameters (McQuillin et al., 1984). 

  

In order to improve the signal content of the data a redundant sampling of the 

same reflection point is used, based on the common midpoint (CMP) reflection 

method (Figure 13; Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). The recorded seismic trace is a 

time-series associated with a source-receiver pair; for processing purposes this 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

18 

geometry needs to be transformed into common midpoint (CMP) coordinates. For 

a horizontal interface, a CMP is a point at the surface located at half-offset 

between the source and the receiver, that is common to several source-receivers 

pairs (Figure 13). The number of times a CMP is sampled represents the fold of 

the data. A CMP gather (Figure 13, below) is a collection of traces that share the 

same midpoint. This method provides enhanced data quality, suppression of 

multiple reflections and improved general signal-to-noise ratio, especially after 

stack (glossary.oilfield.slb.com (c); Robinson et al., 1986; Yilmaz, 1997a). 

 

 

Figure 13 – Seismic data acquisition is done in shot-receiver coordinates (on the top) which is 
processed as a CMP gather. The lower part of the figure shows a six-fold coverage for one CMP 
location (modified from glossary.oilfield.slb.com (c)). 

 

3D Seismic Data 

The acquisition of three-dimensional seismic data started in 1976 (Sheriff and 

Geldart, 1995) and rapidly increased its importance for the petroleum industry due 

to its high vertical and lateral resolution even for great depths (Gomes and Alves, 

2007).  

 



Chapter II 3D Seismic Reflection Data 

19 

Unlike traditional two-dimensional surveys which only provide information in depth 

along a straight line, three-dimensional seismics provides a cube with seismic data 

relative to three dimensions of the space (X,Y and time/depth) organized in inlines 

(with the same direction as the acquisition track) and crosslines (in a perpendicular 

direction of the acquisition path). Depending on the quality of the data in the 3D 

seismic volumes, the interpreter is able to map horizons and follow seismic events 

along the entire acquisition survey area and build a reliable geological model of a 

hydrocarbon reservoir. 

 

3D seismic surveys have probably done more than any other modern technology 

to increase the likelihood of success of exploration drilling (Buia et al., 2008). In 

fact, interpretation of 3D seismic data benefits both exploratory wells (wildcats
3
) 

and development wells. The number of successful wildcats has increased in the 

last decades with the introduction of new acquisition and processing techniques. 

Development wells have also benefited, since the interpretation of three-

dimensional seismic data allows a better knowledge of the subsurface and the 

possibility to develop new solutions to improve wells productivity (Alfaro et al., 

2007). 

 

In three-dimensional seismic acquisition surveys, four to ten streamers separated 

by 50 to 150m and airguns arrays of 12 to 18 guns that can be fired every 10 to 20 

seconds at different times, are normally used (Figure 14; Alfaro et al., 2007).

airguns each and 4 streamers.

 A wildcat is an exploratory well in an area where there are few geological knowledge of the subsurface 

(glossary.oilfield.slb.com (b)).  
 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

20 

Since three-dimensional seismic acquisition is a multi-coverage method there is an 

immediate improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio and multiples attenuation, by 

sampling the same reflection, or bin
4
, several times from different positions. In 

addition, the resulting dense sampling grid and data quality makes it possible to 

map not only hydrocarbon reservoirs but in some cases also assess the quality 

and the distribution of the oil and gas within a reservoir (Alfaro et al., 2007).  

 

II.3. 3D Seismic Marine Acquisition Surveys 

 

A marine acquisition survey requires that the water column is deep enough (more 

than 10m deep) to allow freedom of movements for seismic vessels with lengths 

between 30 to 70m. Marine seismic acquisition is faster and consequently cheaper 

when compared to land surveys, since there are less non-productive time
5
  

(Telford et al., 1990; Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). 

 

The concept of seismic imaging is inextricably linked with the way in which the 

data is acquired (Amundsen and Landon, 2009). Subsurface imaging using 3D 

seismic surveys (Figure 15) is particularly successful in areas with clastic 

sediments. However, problems arise, particularly in the deep-water, when imaging 

sediments beneath hard seafloors, salt, basalts and carbonate layers. These 

limitations are caused by ray bending on the highly reflective and folded layers 

leading to portions of the subsurface remaining unsampled. This effect can be 

particularly important for seismic data acquired in just one direction. The key for a 

representative “picture” of the subsurface is a successful data acquisition with a 

360º azimuth-offset illumination of the target area, only possible to achieve with 

the introduction of new acquisition geometries which consider more than one track 

direction (Buia et al., 2008).

 Bins are small square areas (normally 25 m by 25 m) that are treated as reflection points for the purpose of 

3D data processing (Alfaro et al., 2007).

 Non-productive time is the time spend not acquiring data due to field operations. In the marine seismic 

acquisition sense means the amount of time a seismic vessel spends in transit from the end of one seismic 
line to the beginning of the next one.

In the oil and gas industry new proposed approaches for seismic data acquisition 

pretend to face the great challenge of today, imaging correctly the subsalt and 

reduce the number of dry holes in exploratory wells (Alfaro et al., 2007). 

 

 

Figure 15 – Schematic representation of a seismic vessel acquiring 3D seismic data, sailing in a 
straight path. Azimuth is the angle, at the source array, between the sail path and the considered 
receiver (Modified from Alfaro et al., 2007. 

 

Typical Marine Seismic Surveys 

In conventional seismic acquisition surveys, the data is acquired by a single 

seismic vessel sailing in straight parallel lines, with opposite directions providing a 

coverage of about every 12.5m, with multiple streamers, over a target area (Figure 

16). The seismic vessel is normally equipped with eight to ten streamers and a 

variable number of airguns and source arrays, depending on the target depth 

(Alfaro et al., 2008). 

 

This kind of survey has a high percentage of non-productive time represented by 

curved path between the end of one line and the beginning of the next. In total, 

non-productive time can reach 50% of the total duration of the survey, therefore 

increasing acquisition costs (Buia et al., 2008).  

 

If well planned, this acquisition geometry is enough to obtain a reasonable imaging 

of the subsurface for almost all geological environments. Moreover, since it is a 

standard oil industry acquisition scheme, seismic processing flows are well known 

and easily applied with high effectiveness in noise reduction and improvement of 

the data quality. However, there are imaging limitations related to some geological 

contexts which cause ray bending (e.g. areas affected by intense salt tectonics) 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

22 

and when there are infrastructures that obstruct the acquisition path creating 

coverage gaps (Alfaro et al., 2007).  

 

 

Figure 16 - Schematic representation of a traditional seismic survey. The vessel sails in parallel 
lines with opposite directions, curved paths represent non-productive time because the acquisition 
system is switched off. The target area is divided in bins for the purpose of processing the data 
(Buia et al., 2008). 

 

Typical marine seismic acquisition surveys have narrow azimuth-offset coverage, 

just +/- 10º azimuths for far offsets (Figure 19a), since the illumination is just in one 

direction and the direction of the reflected ray path will be close to the vessel track. 

In order to attenuate the lack of azimuth-offset illumination of this acquisition 

geometry, it should be carried out ensuring the maximum possible trace coverage 

per bin (Alfaro et al., 2007; Buia et al., 2008). 

 

This conventional acquisition geometry is the mostly used acquisition method to 

acquire 3D seismic data worldwide. However, seismic data can easily have low 

quality, making the interpretation process very difficult, leading to possible 

incorrect reservoir prediction and characterization. Alternative seismic acquisitions 

geometries based on more than one sailing direction have been more recently 

developed to obtain more consistent and reliable 3D seismic data (Alfaro et al., 

2007). 



Chapter II 3D Seismic Reflection Data

Wide-Azimuth Seismic Surveys  

Wide-azimuth surveys (WAZ) were first introduced in the oil and gas exploration 

industry by BP and PGS
6
 in 2001 with a testing acquisition survey in the 

Norwegian Sea (Alfaro et al., 2007).  

 

WAZ is a multi-vessel based method which follows the same acquisition pattern as 

a typical survey, in straight and parallel lines, but at least two source seismic 

vessels are used. The source vessels follow the recording vessel (typically with 

ten streamers), one behind and the other besides the streamer (Figure 17). Other 

geometries using additional seismic receiver vessels can also be applied 

depending on the complexity of the subsurface target (Alfaro et al., 2007; Buia et 

al., 2008). 

 

This method has proven improvements for large surveys in areas with great 

complexity and in subsalt imaging. For an effective seismic data quality, the survey 

should be designed taking into account the greatest possible distance between the 

source and the receiver, in a perpendicular direction to the acquisition path 

(crossline direction) and between consecutive acquisition lines depending on the 

number of involved vessels and the size of the survey area (Alfaro et al., 2007). 

 

The wide-azimuth acquisition technique provides a general increase in coverage 

for all azimuths-offsets when compared to the traditional acquisition system. In 

fact, for near offsets it provides a full azimuth range, the optimal situation, and +/- 

30º for far-offsets (Figure 19b). 

 

Lastly, processing flows for data acquired by WAZ geometries are derived from 

those applied to data supplied by conventional seismic acquisition surveys, but 

after several basic processing steps. When compared with conventional 3D data, 

WAZ seismic data shows less coherent noise, higher resolution, improved multiple 

attenuation and much better seismic reflectors continuity and interpretability, 

especially for those beneath salt bodies (Alfaro et al., 2007).

towed-streamer and the other besides the receivers. 

 

Coil Shooting Seismic Surveys 

A new revolutionary technique for seismic acquisition – Coil Shooting
7
  – has been 

recently introduced by WesternGeco, first tested in 2006 in the Gulf of Mexico, to 

solve the limited range of azimuth-offset fold from traditional and multi-vessel 

acquisition surveys (Buia et al., 2008). Coil Shooting (Figure 18) is a single-vessel 

method, with one powerful source and ten streamers, to acquire high-quality 3D 

seismic reflection data in large and continuous linked circles (with 5 to 7km of 

radius) (Buia et al., 2008; Amundsen and Landro, 2009). 

 

Like many other breakthrough technical developments, the idea to acquire seismic 

data along a circular pattern is not recent. In fact, it remounts to the 1980’s but 

only in the last years, with the development of new seismic sources and receivers 

and the arising of new tools for precise receiver positioning, did it became possible 

the real implementation of this method (Buia et al., 2008). 

 

The acquisition survey is planned in order that the target area is covered by an  

overlapping circular pattern in which the seismic vessel sails, shooting and 

recording continuously (Figure 18), reducing in this way the typical non-productive 

time of a seismic marine survey and consequently costs and survey duration.

 Coil Shooting is a trademark of Schlumberger. 



Chapter II 3D Seismic Reflection Data 

25 

The result is high quality of three-dimensional seismic data with improved signal-

to-noise ratio, multiple attenuation and enhanced reflectors continuity and 

consistency in every geological environment and even below highly reflective 

layers. It is an extremely powerful method for subsurface imaging since it 

guarantees a full azimuth-offset illumination (Figure 19c). 

 

The potential noise produced by the circular trajectory of the vessel and the 

streamers is compensated with the introduction of new steering devices, used for 

the receivers, that precisely control the depth, the lateral position of the streamers 

and ensure a constant streamer separation. Most of the noise content within the 

data is from cross-currents perpendicular to the streamer direction which can be 

effectively reduced with new processing techniques (Amundsen and Landon, 

2009). 

 

Additionally, the Coil Shooting technique implies lower costs for small to medium 

surveys, when compared to the two methods previously discussed. Being a single-

vessel method makes it also attractive for acquisition surveys in remote areas 

where it is difficult and very expensive to sail with more than one vessel (Buia et 

al., 2009). 

 

 

Figure 18 – Schematic representation of the Coil Shooting acquisition technique. The acquisition is 
done by one single seismic vessel (source and receiver) continuously following a pre-defined 
circular pattern over the target area to provide full azimuth illumination of the subsurface. 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

26 

From the economical point of view and taking into account the huge amount of 

non-productive time for a conventional seismic acquisition survey, it is 

recommended to acquire seismic by the WAZ method for large seismic surveys in 

non remote places and by the Coil Shooting technique for small and medium 

surveys or for surveys realized in remote areas (Buia et al., 2008).

recorded at an azimuth-offset pair is plotted in colour. Offset is the distance between the center and 
the considered azimuth (modified from Buia et al., 2008).  

 

II.4. Basic Seismic Data Processing  

 

Standard seismic processing flows are fully implemented and well known in the 

industry with the ultimate goal to increase the vertical resolution, to improve the 



Chapter II 3D Seismic Reflection Data 

27 

signal-to-noise ratio of the data, and to display the seismic events in their correct 

spatial position (McQuillin et al., 1984).  

 

A typical simple processing flow for a 2D survey is composed of a preprocessing 

stage, which includes: demultiplexing, trace editing, spherical divergence and 

geometry corrections, and a processing flow which normally includes: 

deconvolution, CMP sorting, velocity analysis, normal moveout correction, CMP 

stack and migration. The processing concepts and algorithms applied in 3D 

seismic data processing are almost the same as those applied to 2D data. The 

main differences concern: quality control, statics correction, velocity analysis, 

migration and the way in which reflective points are considered for seismic 

processing purposes. In 3D seismic data, reflection points are designated as “bins” 

instead of common midpoints (CMP; Yilmaz, 2001a). 

 

The seismic data is sometimes recorded in a multiplexed way in which samples 

from the same time interval from different shots are recorded consecutively. In 

such cases, the first step of the preprocessing stage consists of demultiplexing, to 

convert the data into a suitable and organized file format for processing purposes. 

In oil industry, the conventional standard for seismic files exchange is SEG-Y 

(Yilmaz, 1997a).  

 

The data is then edited in order to detect and correct abnormal traces with high 

noise content or inverted polarity. If basic filtering is not enough to repair the noisy 

trace they should be eliminated since their contribution will decrease the signal-to-

noise ratio. Basic filtering is also applied to all data in order to reduce the 

characteristic low-frequency noise originated from bad weather and/or sea 

conditions and by undesired movements of the streamer (Yilmaz, 2001a).  

 

The spherical divergence correction applied next is a gain correction function to 

compensate the amplitude effects of spherical wavefront divergence. Finally, the 

data is corrected for the acquisition geometry with the positioning of shots and 

receivers inserted into the trace headers. This simple step is one of the most 

important in the processing flow and many of the problems that arise at later 

stages are originated by geometry definitions errors (Yilmaz, 2001a). 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

28 

Deconvolution is then applied to compress the wavelet shape in the data, recover 

high-frequencies, attenuate reverberations and short-period multiples, increasing 

the vertical resolution of the reflectors and normalizing the frequency spectrum of 

the data (Yilmaz, 1997a).  

 

Ideally, the recorded seismic trace is a convolution of the seismic wavelet, which 

travels from the source through the subsurface, with the reflection coefficient 

series, derived from the properties (in particular density and seismic velocity) of 

the different rock layers crossed by the seismic energy. Deconvolution tries to 

undo this natural convolution process, by eliminating the source signature and 

derived multiples, obtaining the reflection coefficient series. However, the received 

signal does not contain only information about the wavelet signature and the 

Earth’s impulse response. In fact, there many other components such as noise 

and limitation on sources and receivers that make it impossible to obtain the real 

impulse response of the Earth (Yilmaz, 2001a). 

 

The Normal Moveout (NMO) correction is then applied to data sorted by CMP (a 

CMP gather) using a previously created velocity field. This correction removes the 

source-receiver offset effect in a non-dipping seismic reflector, assuming that the 

reflection travel-time, which is a function of offset, follows a hyperbolic trajectory. 

Since reflections arrive first at nearest offsets and later at far offsets, the greater 

the source-receiver offset the larger the delay observed. In the NMO correction, 

seismic events corresponding to seismic reflections are flattened across the offset 

range in order to remove the previously described effect (Figure 20; Yilmaz, 

1997a). 

 

NMO is a dynamic correction since corrections will decrease with the increase in 

two-way-time and the increase in sound speed of rocks (Robinson et al., 1986). 

 

After a detailed velocity analysis, the resulting velocity field is applied for NMO 

correction and to stack the data. Stacking consists of summing the traces which 

belong to a CMP location into just one trace after NMO correction (Figure 21). The 

output data will have reinforced reflections, since noise is theoretically random and 



Chapter II 3D Seismic Reflection Data 

29 

when summed tends to cancel, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio 

(glossary.oilfield.slb.com (e)). 

 

 

Figure 20 – Diagram of six traces displayed before and after normal moveout correction (from 
glossary.oilfield.slb.com). 

 

The classic processing flow normally finishes with a migration algorithm. This 

process attempts the repositioning of the seismic reflections in their supposedly 

true subsurface position in depth. 

 

 

Figure 21 – Data is organized by CMP which are corrected for the normal moveout effect and 
finally stacked to improve data quality (glossary.oilfield.slb.com (e)). 

 

With a proper migration, based on a realistic velocity model, most of the 

diffractions within the data are collapsed. Migration has proven results for 

improving seismic interpretability and mapping of complex structural areas 

intensely folded and faulted. This processing algorithm also increases the spatial 

resolution of the data. For three-dimensional seismic data, 3D-migration 

algorithms are used (Yilmaz, 1997a). 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

30 

Another way of applying a migration algorithm is before stack (pre-stack 

migration). Pre-stack migration is an intensive time-consuming and a heavy 

computation process which allows to imaging reflectors with abrupt variations of 

lateral velocities, with non-hyperbolic reflection events, conflict dips, and steep 

discontinuities. The algorithm is applied trace to trace at each CMP location, 

instead of being applied to the stacked data. Pre-stack migration will solve seismic 

imaging below salt bodies which is especially important in hydrocarbon migration 

and accumulation detection (Yilmaz, 1997a). 

 

All the processing steps should be quality controlled through seismic cross-

sections displays in order to ensure that the quality of the data is not diminishing 

(Yilmaz, 2001b). 

 

II.5. Interpretation of 3D Seismic Data 

  

Seismic interpretation is the last stage in the oil and gas industry to prospect and 

correctly identify hydrocarbon reservoirs on properly migrated seismic cubes. 

Without a consistent interpretation, the seismic data itself is useless (Robinson et 

al., 1986). 

 

Seismic data interpretation is an exhaustive data analysis process. Nowadays 

there is a lot of geological information associated with a seismic volume, which 

should be taken into account. This large amount of information increases the time 

consumption but, if well correlated, reduces the uncertainty to build a reliable 

geological model (Yilmaz, 2001b).  

 

The interpreter must combine the various components of the dataset (e.g. 3D 

seismic cube, 2D lines and well log data) in order to recognize seismic patterns 

that can give clues about potential hydrocarbon accumulations sites, depositional 

environments and the structural geology of the area. This recognition is often 

based on comparisons between the data and a mental database created by the 

interpreter’s experience. As such many people consider the interpretation process 

as something in between a science and art (Chopra and Marfurt, 2005). 



Chapter II 3D Seismic Reflection Data 

31 

The interpretation is done visually and interactively, in powerful workstations, over 

vertical seismic sections, in inline and crossline directions, and in horizontal 

seismic sections called horizontal time slices. Available interpretation software 

(Chapter III) allows the manipulation and visualization of seismic data together 

with well log data and allows correcting possible mis-ties. This combined 

visualization allows associating seismic reflectors to boundaries of known 

lithological layers (Robinson et al., 1986). Identified features such as faults and 

key seismic reflectors (called horizons), are interpreted based not only in the 

travel-time but also in the amplitude content, with the objective of building a 

reliable geologic model (Yilmaz, 2001b). 

 

Direct hydrocarbon indicators (DHI) in seismic data are not as common as often 

assumed. Only in few datasets show reflections which can be unequivocally 

interpreted as DHIs. The interpreter will therefore mainly be looking for structures, 

both tectonic and stratigraphic, that can potentially hold hydrocarbon 

accumulations (e.g. faults and antiforms; Gomes and Alves, 2007).  

 

From seismic data alone it is not possible to unambiguously identify lithologic 

sequences or the fluid content filling the pore spaces. This information is normally 

achieved with the use of modeling algorithms, well log data and more recently 

(Robinson et al., 1986) using seismic attributes (Chopra and Marfurt, 2005). In 

fact, seismic attributes are used as a starting point or complement in the 

interpretation process. 

 

A careful interpretation of 3D seismic data allows accurately mapping geological 

features, defining the structural geology and infering about lithological variations 

and their distributions, thereby characterizing the respective depositional systems 

in the survey area. A fully understanding of the study area is the key for success in 

oil and gas exploration and production industries.

Chapter III. 3D Seismic Interpretation in 

Petrel 

 

The development of new technology and the growth of 3D seismic data with lower 

costs, particularly after the 1980s, propelled the emergence of powerful 

interpretation workstations, leaving behind hardware limitations to deal with large 

datasets. Today, innovative commercial software for seismic interpretation and 

analysis can run in ordinary personal computers and easily handle interpretation 

tasks for medium-large datasets. 

 

Available interpretation software tends to be easy-to-use providing several 

automatic algorithms to help the geoscientist in the geophysical interpretation 

process. Automatic tools, when properly supervised by a user, execute a more 

consistent seismic reflectors interpretation based not only in the visual continuity of 

the reflector but also in its consistency in terms of amplitude. Interpreted well log 

data and geological information are easily displayed and correlated with the 

seismic data and other geophysical datasets, reducing the number of mis-ties
8
 and 

allowing the identification within the seismic data of known and important lithologic 

formations. In the seismic attributes domain (see Chapter IV), new software 

solutions have large attributes libraries being able to compute and display them, 

on-the-fly, even for large amounts of three-dimensional seismic data. 

 

These combined factors introduced a new paradigm in seismic interpretation: the 

possibility of creating different geological models, in a faster and reliable way, 

which associated with the increase in quality of seismic data, led to optimized well 

design and location (Chopra and Marfurt, 2005).

 When interpretation from the seismic data does not match well log data or when two seismic lines cross and 

the interpreted seismic reflectors do no match.

34 

There are many seismic interpretation software but the three most used in the oil 

and gas industry are: SeisWorks, Kingdom Suite and Petrel.  

 

SeisWorks is the Landmark UNIX based software suite solution for 2D and 3D 

seismic interpretation and analysis taking into account the existing geological data 

(www.halliburton.com).    

 

The Kindgom Suite software, developed by Seismic Micro-Technology, is a basic 

software package to perform seismic interpretation, 2D and/or 3D, integrated with 

geological and log data with the purpose of building a geological model with less 

time consumption and reduced uncertainty (www.seismicmicro.com). 

  

Petrel is mark of Schlumberger and is a unique “Seismic-to-Simulation Software”. 

It enables the possibility of geologists, geophysicists and reservoir engineers to 

work together as one, in the same work base. The last step in Petrel is creating a 

completely and fully detailed reservoir model: from the interpretation of seismic 

data, through the integration of geological log data and testing of different 

geological scenarios with the aim of modeling and simulating a hydrocarbon 

reservoir (Schlumberger, 2008). 

 

III.1. Seismic – to – Simulation software, Petrel 2008.1 

 

Petrel has been developed by Schlumberger since 1996 and many upgrades have 

been done from version to version in order to improve algorithms and give an 

effective response to the customers’ needs. It unites geosciences and reservoir 

engineering domains to work together allowing to “think critically and in a creative 

way” about the modeled hydrocarbon reservoir. Companies can increase profits by 

reducing the uncertainty and time consumption of data analysis, interpretation and 

modeling, while experiencing the different Petrel modules (Figure 22; 

Schlumberger, 2008; www.slb.com (d)). 

 

Geophysical data can be interpreted, often with automatic picking, either in a 2D 

view or directly from a 3D display of the seismic volume. Automatic interpretation

tools are quality controlled, constrained and validated by a user supported by 

previously computed seismic attributes and/or by other geological well log data. 

 

 

Figure 22 - Petrel 2008.1 module dependency map (modified from www.slb.com (d)). 

 

The correlation between geological and geophysical domains can be done through 

synthetic seismograms or by depth-time conversion using an adequate velocity 

model. With a validated structural geology model of the hydrocarbon reservoir, this 

can be populated with facies and properties distributions based in geostatistic 

analysis (www.slb.com (d)).  

 

Reservoir engineers can easily simulate reservoir flows by exporting the reservoir 

model to Eclipse
9
. The output results are imported back to Petrel where they can 

be displayed and analyzed. Potential wells can be visually designed and used as a 

guide for successful real-time perforation. All of these data and results are 

interactively displayed in proper windows within Petrel’s user interface (see 

Section III.1.1; www.slb.com (d)).

III.1.1. Petrel 2008.1 User Interface 

 

Petrel 2008.1 has a Windows based, user friendly, interface divided in different 

customized areas, as shown in the figure below. 

 

 

Figure 23 - Petrel 2008.1 user interface. 

 

The display window allows the user to visualize different types of data, considered 

as objects. The different data are displayed in the correspondent type of window 

(Figure 24) depending on their type. Seismic data can be displayed in a 3D, 2D or 

in an interpretation window.  

 

Petrel Exploration Pane I (PE-1; Figure 25a) contains all the data within the project 

organized in a tree structure. All data not related to a 3D grid is stored in the Input 

pane, while data related to a 3D grid is located in the Models pane. The Results 

pane stores the numerical results of volume calculations and simulation computed 

from the modeled reservoir. Petrel uses templates to display data and data 

properties. Those templates, or colour scale bars, are saved inside the Template 

pane catalogued in folders by type. More information about templates can be 

found in the following section.

Figure 24 – Example of available windows in Petrel 2008.1. 

 

Exploration Pane II (PE-2; Figure 25b) is located below PE-1 and contains the 

Processes diagram pane, where all available processes are stored by the order 

they should be performed to build a reservoir model. The Workflows pane is where 

workflows, a sequence of pre-designated tasks created by the Process Manager 

are saved. The Cases pane is used when a volume calculation is performed. 

Finally, the Windows pane has information about all the opened windows within 

the project.

 The Function bar is placed by default on the right side of the display window and 

is related to the Processes diagram pane. When a process is active (highlighted) 

available tools to accomplish the process will be shown in Function bar. 

 

III.1.2. Templates in Petrel 2008.1 

 

The way how Petrel displays objects and object properties is through templates 

(Figure 26a). Templates are defined as objects which contain information about 

the colour table settings and the correspondent opacity curve common to groups 

of similar data.  

 

Each template is by default already connected to a group of data and is organized 

inside the Templates pane by folders (Figure 26b). To display an object correctly, 

the template can be visually tuned by to the user in two ways: by accessing 

templates properties through clicking the right mouse button (RMB) on a template, 

or by selecting the desired object and accessing its settings. In both cases it 

should be kept in mind that templates are assigned to groups of similar data 

objects. If a template is changed for one object, this modification will affect the 

display of all the objects under the same template. To edit the template in a 

specific object the user should click on the padlock, inside objects settings, (Figure 

26a, top) or make a copy of the template, edit it and assign it to the desired object 

(Schlumberger, 2008). 

 

The user is free to create a totally new colour range scale, transform continuous 

templates into discrete ones and vice-versa. For example, constraining the 

maximum and minimum values displayed or adjusting the colour scale range, can 

be useful to enhance hidden features. This method is widely applied in seismic 

attributes analysis to withdraw the maximum information from the data.

III.1.3. Importing Seismic Data 

 

Seismic attributes, which are the main topic of this thesis, are computed from 

previously loaded seismic data in Petrel. This section discusses how seismic data 

is imported into a project and what kind of seismic files formats are supported by 

Petrel 2008.1.  

 

Both 2D and 3D seismic data can be loaded into Petrel 2008.1, in standard SEG-Y 

format or in ZGY (internal) bricked format.  

 

SEG-Y is a standard binary format, created by the Society of Exploration 

Geophysicists (SEG) in 1973. This format was created with the purpose to 

become a standard between the seismic data from different oil companies which in 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

40 

the past used proprietary formats (Barry et al., 1975). Nowadays, most of the 

seismic data exchanged between oil companies is recorded in SEG-Y format 

(Gaillot jr., 1994). 

 

The original SEG-Y format has a reel identification header which consists of 3600 

bytes, divided into two parts: the EBCDIC header, with 3200 bytes, where 

information about the survey and about the acquisition parameters are recorded, 

and one Binary header with 400 bytes. Within these 400 bytes, 60 are assigned to 

seismic data information and the rest 340 bytes can be user-assigned to additional 

information. The rest of the SEG-Y file is filled with “n” Trace Data Blocks, 

corresponding one for each recorded trace. 240-bytes are saved for each Trace 

header, where information about the position of the trace is recorded. The rest is 

kept free to record the seismic signal. For detailed information about the SEG-Y 

format it is suggested reading the “SEG Technical Standards” (Barry et al., 1975). 

 

SEG-Y files can be loaded into Petrel in two different ways. If the user is sure that 

the data is saved in the right byte position according to the standard SEG-Y file 

format, the seismic data should be loaded as “SEG-Y seismic data”. If the user is 

not sure about how the data is organized, seismic data should be imported as 

“SEG-Y import with present parameters”. In this way the user can specify the 

correct byte location for each acquisition parameter. Byte locations within the file 

can be checked in the “SEGY headers from first file” (Figure 27). 

 

With the correct byte positions defined, before finishing the loading process, it is 

preferable to do a scan of the first “n” traces to quality control the imported data 

(Figure 28). This last step is very important and the final result should match the 

acquisition parameters such as inline/crossline relative positions and separation. 

 

ZGY extension is a Petrel internal bricked format for 3D cubes or binary format for 

2D seismic data. In this format the seismic data is stored under bricks (instead of 

being stored in the traditional trace format) which allow big datasets to be easily 

accessed and manipulated. Big bricks with low resolution are loaded first into 

memory, after which the program will start loading smaller bricks with higher 

resolution. Using this method, large volumes can be loaded and rendered in a 3D 



Chapter III 3D Seismic Interpretation in Petrel

view, allowing the user to interact with the data at any time, since the loading of 

smaller bricks is stopped if the user moves the view (Schlumberger, 2007b).

It is preferable to use ZGY format within Petrel rather than standard SEG-Y format, 

especially for big datasets with high resolution. ZGY files can be exported into 

SEG-Y to be used in other applications. SEG-Y files can be internally converted in 

ZGY files using the Realize function (see Section III.1.4).  

 

III.1.4. Realize Seismic Cube 

 

The process within Petrel which allows the user to create a physical copy of a 

seismic volume or a 2D seismic line is called Realization. Realization is mainly 

done for three purposes: (1) to allow the user to create a physical copy from virtual 

seismic data; (2) to permit to change data resolution; (3) to convert SEG-Y files 

into ZGY format (Schlumberger, 2007b). 

 

Creating virtual cropped seismic data or seismic attributes cubes is a solution in 

order to save disk space and test different parameters without wasting time. Virtual 

data is efficient to display 2D seismic lines or vertical seismic section of a seismic 

cube. In contrast, to perform quick slicing (on time) or to render a volume it is 

necessary to use a physical copy of the data; this will increase the access time to 

the data but will also create a new ZGY file, with large size, on the hard disk 

(Schlumberger, 2007b). 

 

Petrel also allows changing the seismic data from 32-bytes floating point to 16-

bytes or 8-bytes, which represents, respectively, a file size smaller 50% or 70% 

than the original. Changing the resolution is not critical for many operations; 

however, seismic data should always have 32-bytes resolution if it will be used in 

the automatic interpretation processes. If lower resolution is chosen, the volume 

will not have enough dynamic range
10

 to perform a quality event tracking (Barnes, 

2000; Schlumberger, 2008).

 Dynamic Range is the ratio of the largest measurable amplitude to the smallest. It can be mathematically 
defined as: 20*log10(A1/A2). 



Chapter III 3D Seismic Interpretation in Petrel 

43 

Finally, the last purpose is simply to create a ZGY file format from a SEG-Y file. 

The advantages of using this kind of data in Petrel have already been discussed in 

the previous section. 

 

To access the realization operation the user has to choose the settings menu for 

the respective seismic data object and select the Operations tab (Figure 29) 

followed by a click in “Set from source as shown above” and finally the “Scan” 

button. This first sequence of steps will perform a scan of the values within the 

data and display the result in one histogram. The Filter Bins option should then be 

selected to exclude the maximum spike, often related with null values, in the 

histogram. Removing this effect has special importance when the realization 

process is being done for a seismic attribute volume (Schlumberger, 2007b). 

 

Realization can be very time-consuming and heavy, in terms of computation, and 

may need a large amount of free disk space, although it runs in background 

allowing the user to continue using Petrel for other tasks. 

 

It should be kept in mind that realization should always be done for large seismic 

volumes for an easier manipulation and visualization. The output resolution will 

depend on the purpose of the data.

III.1.5. Computing Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 

 

There are two processes to compute seismic attributes in Petrel 2008.1 and they 

can be found in PE-2, under the Processes pane inside the Geophysics family 

(Figure 30). The available seismic attributes are divided into volume and surface 

attributes. Each process has the available attributes organized by several libraries 

(Figure 31) which attempt to group attributes with similar outputs. 

  

Volume attributes are those computed from an entire 3D seismic cube resulting in 

a new seismic cube containing the attribute information. Surface attributes are the 

value of the computed attribute from a seismic cube in one surface, created from 

seismic interpretation, or in between two surfaces, or between a surface and a 

constant time window.  

 

 

Figure 30 - Volume and Surface attributes processes that can be found under the processes pane, 
in PE-2. 

 



Chapter III 3D Seismic Interpretation in Petrel 

45 

Volume attributes are divided into five libraries and within each library several 

attributes can be chosen in a total of 29 (Figure 31, left). Surface Attributes have 

an extensive list of 50 attributes which are categorized into four libraries 

depending on how they are computed: Amplitude, Statistical, Signal Shape and 

Measurable Interval (Figure 31, right). 

 

Depending on the algorithm for their calculations, seismic attributes may have, or 

not, user-defined parameters which will be taken into account when the algorithm 

is applied, in order to achieve the desired output data with the best quality 

possible. In all user-defined parameters Petrel always suggests a value by default 

which in many cases is suitable for the expected result. 

 

Apart from the catalogued attributes, a myriad of attributes can also be calculated 

with Petrel’s Seismic Calculator. This tool allows the user to create new versions 

of seismic cubes by user-defined formulas. The new attributes seismic cubes are 

generated based on already existing and realized cubes.

Chapter IV. Seismic Attributes in Petrel 

2008.1 

 

The use of seismic attributes has passed through periods of great proliferation and 

enthusiasm contrasting with moments of disuse and lost in credibility (Figure 32). 

These oscillations are closely dependent on the technological development and 

what geophysicists think about them (Chopra and Marfurt, 2005). This chapter 

reflects how seismic attributes, in particular the available in Petrel 2008.1, are 

understood today. 

 

To answer the needs of the exploration and production industry intensive studies 

in seismic attributes have been carried out, mainly due to their potential for 

hydrocarbon reservoir prediction, characterization and monitoring (Chen and 

Sidney, 1997). Interpretation workflows for structural geology, stratigraphy analysis 

and rock/pore fluid properties based on attributes derived from processed seismic 

data, are now daily routines in oil and gas companies (Chopra and Marfurt, 2005). 

Recent developments in multi-attributes analysis, combined with self-learning 

processes (e.g. artificial neural networks) can transform large amounts of data into 

one single seismic volume with valuable geological information content (Cooper, 

2008), shortcutting the heavy interpretation process. 

 

Petrel 2008.1 provides a comprehensive package of both surface and volume 

seismic attributes that can be used in every stage of the hydrocarbon reservoir 

modeling process to reduce uncertainty and complement the available data. In this 

chapter a small introduction to the most important available attributes in Petrel 

2008.1 is presented, followed by the application to a case study (Chapter V). The 

detailed mathematical derivations of the methods are however beyond the scope 

of this work. 

 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

48 

When possible, some best practice, to use in Petrel 2008.1, which combine more 

than one attribute are proposed, in order to achieve a better final result. The order 

in which the attributes are presented in this thesis tries to combine them into 

families, depending on the final result of each attribute. Therefore, attributes from 

the same library with similar results will be introduced one after another with 

examples from real data. 

 

The described algorithms and theoretical background are based on 

Schlumberger’s booklet Interpreter’s Guide to Seismic Attributes (Schlumberger, 

2007a).  

 

IV.1. Introduction to Seismic Attributes 

 

With the proliferation of many seismic attributes it becomes a challenge to strictly 

define what seismic attributes are, when they should be applied and how to 

classify them. These questions remain not totally answered, even for the many 

authors who dedicated part of their work to solve the disordered situation in 

seismic attributes classification (e.g. Chen and Sidney, 1997; Taner, 2000; 2001). 

Nowadays, a consensus has not yet been reached (Barnes 2001).  

 

The definition of seismic attributes given next is a blend of, more or less, accepted 

concepts present first by Taner (1997; 2000; 2001), Barnes (2001), Chopra and 

Marfurt, (2005). An attribute, as the name indicates is an intrinsic quality of an 

object or person (www.priberam.pt). Therefore in the geophysical context, “seismic 

attributes” are a way to describe and quantify a characteristic content of the 

seismic data. Quantified characteristics can be directly computed and/or measured 

from the original data or implied from logical or personal experiences of the user. 

Attributes are also the rate of change of any of these quantities with respect to 

time or space, both from pre- and post-stack seismic data. In a nutshell, seismic 

attributes are new ways to look at the seismic data which conventionally is plotted 

in amplitudes (www-sst.unil.ch). 

 



Chapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 

49 

Seismic attributes emerged to transform the subjective and experience based 

interpretation process into something less tedious, and more objective. They try to 

mimic the interpreter’s expertise, by automatically identifying and correlating 

seismic events with real geological features (Chopra and Marfurt, 2005). Today, 

seismic attributes are added values for structural, stratigraphic and texture 

analysis, and in facies and hydrocarbon reservoir properties prediction, when 

correctly used by an expert user (e.g. Taner, 2001; Barnes, 2001; Sheline, 2005; 

Chopra and Marfurt, 2005). Seismic attributes analyses are not a new concept in 

the seismic world; in fact, attributes derived from seismic data are around since 

the beginning of exploration seismology, in the 1950s (Chopra and Marfurt, 2005). 

So, why was it just in the last few decades that attributes saw their importance 

grow? Cooper (2008) attributes this late development to the traditional resistance 

in the oil and gas industry to the introduction of new concepts and methods.  

 

The enormous number of different seismic attributes has mainly proliferated since 

the 1970s (Figure 32). This “boom” of attributes came about especially after the 

introduction of coloured seismic sections by Balch (1971), following the work of 

Taner et al. (1979) on complex seismic trace analysis (see IV.3.2), and lastly by 

the generalization of 3D seismic data and interpretation workstations (Barnes, 

2001; Chopra and Marfurt, 2005; Cooper, 2008).  

 

Nowadays, with the advances in seismic interpretation technology, seismic 

attributes analysis has became vulgarized, leading in some cases to the abuse 

and wrong use of this valuable tool (Sheline, 2005). The seismic interpreter should 

not stop searching through the suite of available attributes in his interpretation 

workstation after finding one attribute that shows the feature he wants to see. The 

user should use one attribute for each property or feature of interest and combine 

them through geostatistics or other multi-attribute analysis tool, to check the 

correlation between the different attributes (Chopra and Marfurt, 2005).  

 

Historically, attributes are divided depending from where they are derived, how 

sensitive they  are to the geological background of  the data  and if  they are  direct

hydrocarbon indicators (DHIs, e.g. a Bright Spot
11

; Chen and Sidney, 1997). 

 

 

Figure 32 – Time line of seismic attributes development (in italic) and their relation with advances 
in seismic exploration technology, from 1960 to the present. Key works are represented by their 
authors’ name (Modified from Barnes, 2001). 

 

Attributes with the most predictive results are those derived from the various 

seismic wavelet components. The amplitude content within the data effectively 

provides physical parameters about the subsurface such as acoustic impedance, 

reflection coefficients, velocities and absorption effects which supply structural 

detail or act as DHIs. Phase content is used to determine the shape and geometry 

of reflectors and it is an important attribute to improve seismic reflectors continuity 

and for the interpretation of seismic stratigraphy and depositional regimes (Taner, 

2001; Brown, 2001; Chopra and Marfurt, 2005). Frequency derived attributes are 

useful in stratigraphic events, fault interpretation due to absorption effects, as 

DHIs, in forecast of reservoir properties, and when combined with amplitude-

based attributes, they may help in the interpretation of additional geologic layering 

(Brown, 2001).

 A bright spot is an amplitude anomaly within the seismic data that can indicate the presence of 
hydrocarbons. 



Chapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 

51 

A real implementation of multi-attribute analysis is the next step in the seismic 

attributes domain. With multi-attribute analysis, improved spatial coherence of 

depositional events, such as ancient channels systems, is just the beginning of 

what can be reliably predicted (Cooper, 2008). The ultimate step, especially for 

areas where well log data is unavailable, is a real and effective estimation of facies 

distribution and prediction of hydrocarbon reservoirs properties based mostly on 

seismic patterns recognition and correlation (Barnes, 2001; Chen and Sidney, 

1997). 

 

In exploration seismology, seismic attributes can be considered a turning point in 

seismic interpretation. Seismic attributes allow obtaining accurate detailed 

information on structural, stratigraphic and lithological parameters of the seismic 

prospect (Taner, 2001) as an integrated solution (Cooper, 2008) for hydrocarbon 

reservoir identification, modeling and characterization with reduced uncertainty 

(Sheline, 2005). At the limit, the main issue is not the attributes themselves but 

their application, which should be carefully chosen. The desired geologic features 

to be enhanced should be first clearly defined by the interpreter. An attribute 

should not be used just because it is available as a software tool. In multi-attribute 

analysis, attributes should be first correlated to detect if different attributes will not 

enhance the same result. For instance, using too many attributes can generate 

geostatiscal errors in hydrocarbon reservoir properties prediction (Sheline, 2005).   

 

Lastly, apart from a careful and adequate attribute choice, with the right user-

defined parameters, the associated colour scale range with which they will be 

displayed is also a very important aspect (see Section III.1.2). The quality of one 

attribute will be dependent not only on the quality of the original seismic data but 

also in the colour scale bar used to display the attribute. The correct display allows 

the human eye to detect and distinguish subtle changes which may be associated 

with interesting features (Lynch and Lines, 2004). As a last concern, seismic 

attributes should not be applied as recipe, expecting the same result to be always 

achieved independently of the input data and the geological background. Indeed, it 

is necessary to first understand the data and realize first which features will be 

potentially enhanced by the seismic attribute.

IV.2. Classification of Seismic Attributes 

 

With the increasing interest on seismic attributes and their large number and 

diversity it now becomes necessary to catalogue them into different classes. Many 

proposals have been put forward with the aim of classify seismic attributes in a 

tight, strict and intuitive way, based on both the input and the expected result. 

Unfortunately, new attributes appear every day and algorithms of well known 

attributes can be improved since sometimes they give unexpected results. The 

proposed classifications are constantly changing, depending on the understanding 

of the seismic attribute today (Taner, 2000). 

 

Taner et al. (1994) were the first to introduce a coherent and real classification for 

seismic attributes. They created two general categories for seismic attributes: 

geometrical and physical. Geometrical attributes enhance geometrical 

characteristics of the input data such as: dip, azimuth and continuity. Physical 

attributes are related to physical properties of the subsurface which are 

inextricably connected to the lithology. This family of attributes corresponds to 

attributes derived from amplitude, frequency and phase components of the trace. 

These two categories can further be divided into prestack and poststack, 

depending on the data processing step from which they have been computed.  

 

Brown (2004), in Chopra and Marfurt (2005), proposed to classify attributes using 

a tree structure with branches for time, amplitude, frequency and attenuation, with 

each branch being further divided in prestack and poststack attributes. Time 

attributes provide information about structural geology while amplitude attribute 

give information on stratigraphy and reservoir properties.  

 

The Chen and Sidney (1997) classification divides attributes in two main groups: 

one based on wave kinematic/dynamics, and the second group based on geologic 

reservoir features; further sub-divisions depend on where the attribute is extracted 

and on the expected output.   

 



Chapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 

53 

More recently, Chopra and Marfurt (2005) based on classifications from other 

authors, proposed a new classification for seismic attributes. The classification 

divides attributes into: general, specific and composite. General attributes 

comprises seismic attributes which measure geometric, kinematic, dynamic or 

statistical features derived from seismic data. They are related either to the 

physical or morphological character of the data since they represent the response 

of a specific lithology. Therefore they can be generally applicable to different 

geological environments with expected similar outputs. Specific attributes are less 

correlated to the lithological character of the input data and therefore cannot be 

extrapolated to similar geological environments, since their response is intrinsic of 

specific hydrocarbon reservoir properties. Composite attributes include sums, 

products or other combinations of more fundamental general attributes. 

 

Petrel 2008.1 does not follow any of these classification schemes, as discussed 

before. It uses a new and more user-friendly classification for seismic attributes. 

Attributes are first divided into volume and surface attributes, depending on the 

input data, and then into libraries (Figure 31). Each library groups attributes which 

will enhance similar features. 

 

IV.3. Volume Attributes 

 

Volume attributes are computed from processed seismic cubes or from previously 

computed attribute volumes which are extracted, depending on the mathematical 

algorithm, trace by trace or considering a group of traces (multi-traces). The 

extraction is performed over a user-defined fixed window, where two horizontal 

time slices are defined as upper and lower boundaries. 

 

The single-trace method is applied when the computation algorithm operates in 

each trace separately between a vertical fixed window. Attribute extraction is done 

within the user-defined window length in a random position, inside the seismic 

volume. The extracted attribute is then saved in one time slice, which will be 

placed in a central position inside the window interval. The final attribute volume is 

the result from repeating the attribute extraction, with the same vertical range, for 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

54 

different times and spatial positions, and then stacking the resultant slices (Figure 

33a; Chen and Sidney, 1997). 

 

Multi-trace seismic attributes are also computed inside a fixed vertical window with 

user-defined limits. In this case, besides the vertical range, the user has to define 

a bound in the number of traces that will be used to the attribute extraction, 

according to a mathematical algorithm. Like in the single-trace method, the output 

volume is the result of stacking all the time slices were the attribute computation 

was kept from each window position in space and time (Figure 33b; Chen and 

Sidney, 1997). 

 
(a) 

 
(b) 

Figure 33 - Seismic attributes can be generated (a) trace by trace or (b) using a collection of multi-
traces. Blue and red squares represent the upper and lower time slice boundary respectively. 
Traces from where the attributes were extracted are represented in yellow and will be saved in a 
time slice placed in a central position in the computation window (modified from Chen and Sidney, 
1997). 

 

IV.3.1. Seismic Signal Processing Library 

 

In this section a generalized concept of attribute will be used following the 

definition used in Petrel software. As such, frequency filtering and amplitude 

corrections are considered as seismic data attributes. 

 

Petrel’s Seismic Signal Processing library includes attributes related to seismic 

data processing and data display. Attributes within this library are computed 

according to the chosen method on each seismic trace separately. 



Chapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 

55 

Seismic Signal Processing attributes execute small seismic processing steps to 

help the interpreter, who is not an expert in seismic signal theory, to improve data 

quality and consistency without the need to re-process the entire seismic data in a 

special processing software. Available seismic attributes permit the user to 

improve data quality in certain areas of interest, resulting in enhanced data 

coherency by modifying the gain in amplitudes, applying basic filtering and through 

performing phase shifts on the data.  

 

A total of eight seismic attributes are included in Seismic Signal Processing library. 

Three perform phase shifts to the data, useful to match different vintages of 

seismic data and to improve reflectors sharpness; three other are related to 

filtering and amplitude tuning; the last two operate in the energy content of the 

seismic trace. 

 

In all the theoretical description and when describing the mathematical algorithms 

which are used to extract each seismic attribute, the original seismic trace, also 

called original amplitude, will be from now on designated by f(t).  

 

IV.3.1.1. First Derivative 

 

The first derivative attribute is defined as the time rate change of the input trace, or  

the derivative of f(t) with time. 

 Eq. (3) 

The first derivative of a digitized seismic trace can be approximately calculated by: 

 Eq. (4) 

Visually, applying the first derivative attribute to a collection of seismic traces is the 

same as computing a phase shift of 90º for those traces.  As such, no user-defined 

parameter is required for this step. First derivative can, first, be useful to quality 

check the signal consistency, since positive or negative picks should produce zero 

crossings, to improve reflector sharpness, match different versions of seismic data 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

56 

and improve the correlation between seismic data and lithology-indicative well log 

data (Zeng, 2005a; b). 

 

Nowadays most of the seismic data is acquired, or processed, to have a constant 

nearly zero-phase wavelet (Figure 34), which historically is the best type of 

wavelet to use in seismic interpretation. Indeed a zero-phase wavelet resolves 

better the top and the bottom of a bed, separated from more than 1/4 of the 

dominant wavelength, for simple layered models (1/4 of the wavelength is 

traditionally defined as the maximum value for seismic vertical resolution). 

 

If a 90º-phase wavelet, shifted from nearly zero-phase seismic data (Figure 34), is 

used, the vertical resolution increases with a decrease in thin-bed interference. In 

addition, the output volume will have significantly improvements for lithologic, 

stratigraphic and depositional facies interpretation. Thin layers analysis also 

become easier because reflectors have increased consistency and sharpness, 

leading to a better amplitude-lithology correlation (Zeng, 2005a; b). 

 

This method is also effective in thin-bed hydrocarbon reservoirs, which most times 

are unresolved in zero-phase data, since the fluid anomaly signal is better 

detected with stronger amplitude and higher stratigraphic resolution; although the 

original seismic data should have a high signal-to-noise ratio and an original 

wavelet with small side lobes (Zeng, 2005b). 

 

 

Figure 34 - Zero-phase wavelet (on the left) and 90
o
-phase wavelet (on the right). Both wavelets 

are with SEG polarity inverted, black is positive amplitude (modified from Zeng, 2005a). 



Chapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 

57 

Visually, comparing 90º-phase (Figure 35b) with nearly zero-phase seismic data 

(Figure 35a), an increased vertical resolution and sharpness of seismic reflectors 

can be observed, which are two pre-requisites for thin-bed interpretation. The use 

of first derivate attribute volumes, calculated from a zero-phase seismic data, has 

proven improved interpretability and can be used as seismic conditioning for 

automatic picking tools in seismic reflector interpretation, working as an added 

value to reduce interpretation time-consumption.  

 

Typically the correlation between the seismic and well log data is poor due to the 

different nature of these two techniques. Well log data is acquired with high 

frequency sources while seismic data is normally acquired with low frequency
12

. 

Seismic data processed to have a 90º-phase wavelet better mimics the acoustic 

log signal, increasing the correlation between the seismic data and lithology-

indicative well log data, particularly for acoustic impedance and porosity logs 

(Figure 36; Zeng, 2005b). 

 

(a) (b) 

Figure 35 – (a) Original seismic line and correspondent (b) first derivative attribute. The first 
derivative attribute data shows higher vertical resolution, with enhanced reflectors continuity and 
sharpness. Peaks in amplitude will produce zero crossings in the extracted attribute. 

 

Computing the first derivative attribute twice will produce the same effect as 

executing the second derivative attribute or, i.e. a 180º
 
phase shift. Another point 

of interest when applying a first derivative, which will be further discussed in 

                                            
12

 Low frequency will produce more penetration and less vertical resolution while high frequencies result in 
less penetration but higher vertical resolution.

Section IV.3.2, is that Petrel 2008.1 uses the same algorithm to calculate the 

Hilbert Transform, for complex seismic trace analysis.

 superimposed with nearly zero-phase seismic data, on the left, 
and superimposed with 90º-phase wavelet (on the right). A generalized better match between 
seismic data and well log data is achieved when a 90º-phase seismic data is used. 

 

IV.3.1.2. Second Derivative  

 

Mathematically this attribute is defined as the second time derivative of the original 

seismic trace. Similar to the calculation of the first derivative, Petrel uses an 

approximation algorithm to extract this attribute from the original seismic data, 

Equation 6.  

 Eq. (5) 

                                            
13

 DPHI is a density porosity well log data used to estimate the porosity from a formation density 
measurement. 



Chapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 

59 

 Eq. (6) 

 

Similarly to the first derivate, where a 90º-phase shift of the seismic data is 

calculated, the second derivative attribute performs a 180º-phase shift. Visually, 

the output volume attribute will have traces with inverted polarity; peaks will 

become troughs and troughs become peaks (Figure 37). As such, this attribute 

can be used to match seismic data from the same area which that has been 

recorded with inverted polarities. Another potentiality of this attribute is to check 

the consistency of the signal. Computing the second derivative twice to the same 

collection of traces should result in an output cube with the same polarity and 

consistency as the original seismic data. 

 

(a) (b) 

Figure 37 – (a) Original seismic data and (b) computed second derivative attribute. The attribute 
shows inverted polarity when compared to the original seismic section. Seismic data is displayed in 
variable density superimposed by wiggle variable area display. 

 

Second derivative also improves reflectors continuity and sharpness in areas 

where reflections are poorly resolved on the raw amplitudes (Figure 38). However, 

the interpreter should be cautious as lateral amplitude variations will be 

diminished, which difficult applying automatic picking tools to interpret regional 

events.

Figure 38 – (a) Original seismic data and (b) extracted second derivative attribute. Orange arrows 
show enhanced reflectors continuity for a small area. On the other hand at a larger scale seismic 
reflectores become more blury. 

 

IV.3.1.3. Phase Shift (Phase Rotation) 

 

The phase shift attribute is a user-defined variable phase rotation (or shift) of the 

original seismic trace in the frequency domain. 

 

This attribute is mainly used to match different vintages of seismic data which 

have been recorded in different phases. As described before, performing a 90
o
-

phase shift is the same as computing the first derivative attribute (see Section 

IV.3.1.1), and choosing an angle of 180
o
 is the same as generating the second 

derivative attribute (see IV.3.1.2). 

 

IV.3.1.4. Graphic Equalizer 

 

The graphic equalizer attribute is as a user-defined frequency band-pass filter that 

can be applied to attenuate or enhance specific frequencies, or interval of 

frequencies, in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and the reflectors 

continuity. 

 

In Petrel this filtering is executed in the frequency domain by Equation 7.  

 Eq. (7) 



Chapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 

61 

Where W(?) is a linearly interpolated frequency sampled weighting function based 

on user-defined settings. In Equation 7 the frequency signal is represented by its 

coefficients expressed as magnitude and phase angle (?).  is the radian 

frequency. 

 

 

Figure 39 - Graphic equalizer attribute sliding control in Petrel. Toggling High-band on, the 
frequency range is extended to 250 Hz. The figure shows the parameters used to compute the 
output result shown in Figure 40. 

 

This weighting function is created interactively in Petrel by sliding a control for 

each tenth frequency on graphic equalizer attribute dialog box (Figure 39). The 

slider position will attenuate, boost or leave the frequencies as they are originally. 

If the slider is over a value between 0 and 1, frequencies will be attenuated; if the 

slider is over a value between 1 and 2 the selected frequency will be boosted; at 

zero, frequencies will be deleted. 

 

Seismic data is usually processed all-in-one with the same processing flow, which 

sometimes leads to areas less resolved then others. Some of these poorly 

resolved areas can have interesting features for the interpretation process. The 

graphic equalizer attribute allows the interpreter to filter out some frequencies, 

increasing the signal-to-noise ratio and improving data quality within those areas. 

Several band-pass filters with different parameters can easily be created almost 

on-the-fly, in Petrel, and combined in the interpretation process to show different 

aspects of the same data.  

 

Figure 40 shows an example in which the graphic equalizer has been tested. The 

output seismic section has enhanced reflectors continuity solving ambiguous 

situations in the interpretation process.

Highlighting reflectors that are consistent at different frequencies is the proposed 

workflow to solve ambiguous situations in seismic reflectors terminations (Figure 

41).  

 

In a nutshell, the graphic equalizer attribute is an extremely useful attribute in 

Petrel 2008.1. It applies different band-pass filters with user-defined frequencies, 

on-the-fly, allowing the user to test different filtered frequency intervals in order to 

adjust the data to his needs.

IV.3.1.5. Time Gain 

 

During the propagation of the seismic energy inside the Earth its amplitude is 

attenuated with time. Sometimes errors during the seismic acquisition can origin 

time dependent variation in the seismic amplitudes. These effects are normally 

compensated with the introduction of a spherical divergence correction in the 

seismic processing stage. The time gain attribute is applied when specific time-

dependent corrections are necessary for interpretation.Mathematically the balance 

of amplitudes with time is computed by the following equation, where ? is a user-

defined parameter:  

 Eq. (8) 

Values of ? bigger than one will produce an increase of amplitudes with time while 

values of ? smaller than one will produce a decrease of amplitudes with time 

(Figure 42).

time and amplitudes below the -1800 ms are boosted, relative to the shallower reflections.

IV.3.1.6. Trace AGC 

 

Trace AGC attribute applies the traditional Automatic Gain Control (AGC), which 

was intensively used in the past and directly recorded during the acquisition of 

seismic data or applied during processing. AGC aims to provide mild amplitudes to 

all the data, reducing the signal amplitude where it is too strong or increasing it 

when it is weak (en.wikipedia.org (a)). 

 

The use of AGC should be cautious in particular if the data is too noisy, because 

amplitudes related to the noise content will also be boosted in order to match the 

larger amplitudes of the signal. To minimize this effect, it is more adequate to use 

a seismic volume previously filtered (e.g. a structurally smoothed attribute volume; 

see IV.3.3.4) as an input to compute the Trace AGC attribute. This practice 

produces most of times a good result.

computed within a window of size 9. Orange arrows show reflectors with improved coherency in

Chapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 

65 

Petrel 2008.1 computes trace AGC by balancing the RMS
14

 level on a moving 

window with a user-defined length. Mathematically speaking, the trace AGC is 

calculated as: 

 

 Eq. (9) 

Where Smax is defined as the maximum amplitude value of the entire survey. The 

correspondent output data are the amplitude values, scaled with the RMS 

amplitude over a fixed-size window. 

 

The trace AGC output attribute volume often shows improvements in the 

coherency and continuity of seismic reflectors especially for areas with weak 

seismic events (Figure 43). 

 

IV.3.1.7. Trace Gradient 

 

The trace gradient attribute computes the gradient along a trace between 

consecutive samples. 

 
Eq. (10) 

 

Where K is the user-defined number of samples. 

 

High values of trace gradient are related with consecutive points having great 

changes in amplitudes. This attribute is useful to distinguish between seismic units 

and can be correlated with areas with abrupt changes in lithologies, related to 

differences in acoustic impedance (Figure 44b). 

 

Displaying together the original seismic data (Figure 44a) superimposed with trace 

gradient attribute (Figure 44c), with an adjusted transparency curve (on the lower 

left corner of Figure 44c), produces a sensation of relief of the seismic events. This 

effect is the same which is experienced when seismic data is displayed with 

Petrel’s “bump illumination” option activated (Schlumberger, 2007b).

 RMS Amplitude is defined as the “Root Mean Square” of amplitude. For further description it is suggested 
Section IV.3.1.8.

used to blend the two attributes is on the lower left corner of (c). Trace Gradient is displayed by 
default in a black-grey-white scale where white represents the maximum value and black the 
lowest value. 

 

IV.3.1.8. RMS Amplitude 

 

“Root Mean Square” (RMS) amplitude is perhaps the most known attribute in the 

seismic world and by definition it is the “root mean square” of the original seismic 

trace amplitude. The RMS amplitude (ARMS) attribute is extracted from the seismic 

trace within a user-defined moving window with a width of N samples (Equation 

11). This attribute gives information about the energy content of the seismic data.  



Chapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 

67 

 Eq. (11) 

Typically, attributes related to the energy content of the seismic trace are used to 

distinguish different kinds of lithologies (Figure 45). High values of RMS 

amplitudes are commonly related to high porosity lithologies, such as porous 

sands, which are potential high quality hydrocarbon reservoirs.  

 

 

(a) 

 

(b) 

Figure 45 – (a) Seismic section displaying original seismic data and (b) extracted RMS amplitude. 
Based on the energy content of the seismic data, different packages of lithologies are more easily 
differentiated. The vertical interval bounded by the two green lines corresponds to a deep-sea 
channel complex.  

 

In oil and gas industry, RMS amplitudes are traditionally computed as a surface 

attribute or in strata slices (Zeng et al. 1998) to build attribute maps. Computing 

the RMS amplitude attribute for an entire seismic cube enables the user to look at 

the data in a different perspective. Rendering a RMS volume attribute where only 

high values are displayed as in Figure 46, for example,  can be used to interpret 

ancient channels systems and in the recognition of bright spots. 

 

The size of the window where the attribute is extracted is a key factor in RMS 

amplitude attribute. Small size windows will show local geologic effects and not the 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

68 

desired effect of anomalies with high values of RMS amplitude; large size windows 

will integrate energy from different sources and anomalies will not be 

distinguished. 

 

 

Figure 46 – High RMS amplitudes in the whole 3D seismic cube viewed from above (all RMS 
amplitudes below a certain threshold – see inset in figure – were hidden). High amplitudes (in 
yellow) define a complex of ancient meandering channels (between the two red dashed lines). 
Sand channels are traditionally high quality hydrocarbon reservoirs. The opacity curve used in this 
display is also shown on the right side of the figure. 

 

IV.3.1.9. Reflection Intensity 

 

The last attribute included in this library (Seismic Processing Attribute’s library) is 

also related to the energy content of the seismic trace and is called reflection 

intensity (ARI). The reflection intensity attribute is defined as the average amplitude 

over a user-defined moving window of N values multiplied by the sample interval 

(often assumed as 1). This attribute is similar to envelope attribute (see IV.3.2.2) 

but only considers the real part of the seismic trace. 

 Eq. (12) 

This attribute is useful for the delineation of amplitude features while retaining the 

frequency content of the original trace (Figure 47). This reflection intensity attribute 



Chapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 

69 

can be used to distinguish different type of lithologies, and/or events that have the 

same amplitude but different frequency components. Conjugated with the 

envelope, it forms a valuable tool for AVO
15

 analysis.

(b) 

Figure 47 – (a) Original seismic plot; (b) Reflection Intensity (RI) seismic attribute. Differences in 
lithologies can be deduced by the differences in the value of RI and the frequency content of the 
data. 

 

IV.3.2. Complex Trace Attribute Library 

 

Seismic attributes found under the Complex Trace Attributes library mainly result 

from the work done by Taner et al. (1979). These authors demonstrated the 

benefit of thinking about the conventional seismic trace as an analytical signal 

having both real and imaginary parts, where the real part is the conventional 

seismic trace and the imaginary part can be calculated from the real part 

(Bracewell, 1978; Taner et al., 1979; Schlumberger, 2007a).  

                                            
15

 Amplitude Variation with Offset (AVO) is technique widely used in the oil and gas industry to detect fluid 
content in the rocks from the analysis of 3D seismic data. 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

70 

Visually, plotting the entire complex seismic trace (FHI (t)), in the complex plane, 

can be thought as a vector with variable length, that is continually rotating along 

the time axis, tracing out an irregular helix (Figure 48). Both components of the 

complex seismic trace (real and imaginary), when plotted individually on the real 

and imaginary planes, respectively, have the same configuration with a shift of 90º 

(Taner et al, 1979). 

 

Figure 48 - Isometric diagram showing a complex seismic trace having both real and imaginary 
part. The real and the imaginary part of the seismic trace have a 90º-shift between them (Taner et 
al., 1979). 

 

Using Fourier transforms there are fully implemented processes to interpret and 

analyze seismic data in both time and frequency domain. Fourier analysis allows 

thinking about average properties of a large portion of the seismic trace; 

alternatively, complex trace analysis permits the user to think locally since this 

transform technique retains the local significance of the seismic data (Taner et al. 

1979). 

 

Mathematically the analytical signal, or complex seismic trace, FHI(t) is given by: 

 Eq. (13) 

f(t) is the real part of the analytical seismic trace, or the conventional seismic trace, 

and f*(t) represents the imaginary (or quadrature) component of the seismic trace. 

f*(t) is calculated through H{f(t)}, the Hilbert Transform, Equation 14. This operator, 



Chapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 

71 

when applied to a complex analytical signal, introduces a phase shift of –?/2 for 

each positive frequency and +?/2 for each negative frequency. 

 Eq. (14) 

Where PV the Cauchy Principal Value, which allows the integration in the 

presence of singularities (in this case for ?=t). 

 

The seismic signal is normally expressed in terms of time-dependent amplitude 

A(t), and time-dependent phase ?(t). The real part, f(t), can be considered as a 

cosine function (Equation 15); therefore, since the real and the imaginary parts are 

shifted 90º, the correspondent complex component,  f*(t), is a sine function 

(Equation 16).  

 

 
Eq. (15) 

 Eq. (16) 

The complex seismic trace, FHI(t), can then be defined by: 

 Eq. (17) 

Complex seismic traces are normally defined in a Cartesian system. However this 

results in difficult and complex calculations, leading to non reliable results. Euler’s 

method is an alternative to overcome the calculation complexities. Equation 17 

can be expressed using Euler’s formula, by:   

 Eq. (18) 

Following Euler’s relationships (Figure 49), using known values of f(t) and f*(t), two 

attributes (or measurements) can be directly extracted from complex trace 

analysis; Reflection Strength, or envelope (Section IV.3.2.2), which is the modulus 

of the entire complex trace (Equation 19) and instantaneous phase (Section 

IV.3.2.3), which is the argument of a complex signal, Equation 20. 

 Eq. (19) 

 Eq. (20) 

The Instantaneous frequency (IV.3.2.5) attribute can be derived from the phase 

information using: 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

72 

 
Eq. (21) 

 

Complex seismic trace analysis enables a natural separation between the 

amplitude and the phase content of the seismic data, from which instantaneous 

complex attributes are generated. This new insight in seismic interpretation 

provides additional information, from a usually “hidden” component of the seismic 

data (Taner et al. 1979).  

 

 

Figure 49 – Graphical representation of Euler’s relationships. 

 

In complex trace attributes analysis, the interpreted features have to be consistent 

in the various components of the analytical seismic trace: amplitude, energy 

(envelope), frequency (instantaneous frequency), and phase (instantaneous 

phase). Complex attributes, more than any other seismic attributes have to be 

displayed with a proper colour scale range (Taner et al. 1979). 

 

Complex seismic attributes are instantaneous attributes computed trace-by-trace.  

 

IV.3.2.1. Apparent Polarity 

 

Apparent polarity is the sign of f(t), the real part of the complex trace, at a local 

maximum of the envelope (see Section IV.3.2.2; Figure 50), over a window with a 



Chapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 

73 

user-defined length. Depending on the sign of f(t) at the local maximum of the 

envelope, a colour is assigned, traditionally blue for negative values and red for 

positive. Variations on the value of the envelope will produce a gradation between 

blue and red.  

 

Theoretically, the polarity of the seismic trace reveals the sign of the reflection 

coefficient whenever the received signal is from a single reflection of a zero-phase 

wavelet. However, most reflection events correspond to more than one single 

reflection; this will reduce the correlation between the signal of the reflection 

coefficient and the wave polarity. Due to this non-correlation effect, this attribute 

was created (Taner et al., 1979).  

 

The apparent polarity attribute is particularly used to enhance event continuity, 

improving seismic reflectors interpretation through automatic tools. Lateral 

variations of apparent polarity along a reflector may indicate lateral variations in 

lithology (Figure 51). Thick beds can be easier detected with apparent polarity 

interpretation since the data is not affected by waveform effects. 

 

 

Figure 50 – Schematic representation of how apparent polarity is computed and its relationship 
with the original seismic trace and the envelope attribute (Schlumberger, 2007a). 

 

This attribute is highly effective for quality seismic data with little noise content. For 

data with considerable noise, and using Petrel 2008.1, it is suggested to compute 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

74 

apparent polarity from a structural smoothing (see IV.3.3.4) seismic cube, where 

the spatial noise is reduced to the minimum. 

 

(a) 
 

(b) 

Figure 51 – (a) Seismic section with original amplitude and (b) extracted apparent polarity 
attribute. Apparent polarity enhances reflectors’ continuity and lateral changes of lithology. 
Apparent polarity volumes are good for input into automatically picking interpretation tools. 

 

When displayed with envelope and instantaneous frequency attributes apparent 

polarity can be used to distinguish different kinds of bright spots. Bright spots 

associated with gas accumulations generally show negative polarity, while positive 

polarity often appears associated to gas-oil and gas-water interface (Taner et al. 

1979). 

 

IV.3.2.2. Envelope (Reflection Strength) 

 

The envelope attribute, or Reflection Strength as designated by Taner et al. 

(1979), was probably the first attribute calculated with Complex Trace Analysis. It 



Chapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 

75 

is defined as the total instantaneous energy of the entire analytical trace, both real 

and imaginary parts (Figure 52). In other words, the envelope is the modulus of 

the analytical seismic trace, computed following the Equation 19 over a user-

defined window. 

 

Envelope is a phase-independent attribute. This means that maximum values of 

the envelope may not be at the same position of maximum peaks, or troughs, 

when compared with the input seismic data (Taner et al., 1979). The envelope 

attribute can be used to compare different seismic vintages, with different phases, 

since both should have the peak energy always aligned.   

 

As an attribute related to the energy content of the seismic trace, it is useful to 

detect major and subtle lithological changes that may be difficult to interpret from 

the original seismic input. High values of the envelope can appear due to major 

lithological changes and sedimentary sequences boundaries as well as related to 

bright spots caused by gas accumulations. Gradual lateral changes of envelope 

values are often correlated with lateral variations in lithologies (Taner et., 1979). 

 

 

Figure 52 – Schematic representation of how envelope attribute is computed and its relationship 
with the real seismic trace and the imaginary seismic trace (Schlumberger 2007a). 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

76

(b) 

Figure 53 – (a) Original seismic section and (b) correspondent envelope attribute. Major and subtle 
lithologic changes are enhanced by the envelope attribute when compared to the original seismic 
section. Rather than for interpreting individual reflectors, the envelope is be used to identify related 
seismic units through their energy content.  

 

Interpretation of thin-beds, especially those inside a hydrocarbon reservoir, can be 

very difficult in original amplitudes due to interference effects. Using the envelope 

attribute with the right parameters, calibrated to the formation thickness, can help 

to distinguish features which are not always detectable, by their energy content.  

 

IV.3.2.3. Instantaneous Phase 

 

The instantaneous phase attribute is computed from the argument of the complex 

seismic trace (?) Equation (20) in a user-defined window.  

 

Instantaneous phase enhances both weak and strong seismic events due to the 

invariant nature of the attribute in terms of amplitudes. This attribute has proven 

results enhancing reflectors continuity, discontinuities, faults and pinch-outs. 

Seismic stratigraphy patterns (e.g. onlaps and offlaps) are easily identified with 

this attribute allowing the interpreter to deduce more easily the sedimentary 



Chapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 

77 

processes that affected the area (Taner et al., 1979). Thin-bed hydrocarbon 

reservoirs often cause local phasing due to the presence of hydrocarbon 

accumulations, which explains classifying instantaneous phase as a DHI, a 

potential Direct Hydrocarbon Indicator (Chen et al., 1997).  

 

The proper display for instantaneous phase should take into account that phase 

varies between -180º to 180º. The associated template should therefore consider 

a circular colour scale bar where the two extreme angles should have the same 

colour, since they correspond to the same phase angle (Figure 54). 

 

 

(a) 

 

(b) 

Figure 54 - (a) Seismic section displayed in original amplitude and (b) corresponding 
instantaneous phase attribute where reflectors have enhanced continuity. Faults and seismic 
stratigraphy patterns (reflectors terminations) are better interpreted. 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

78 

IV.3.2.4. Cosine of Instantaneous Phase 

 

The Cosine of instantaneous phase, or normalized amplitude, is the cosine of the 

instantaneous phase angle (?; see Section IV.3.2.3). Amplitude peaks and troughs 

will remain at the same position but strong and weak events will exhibit equal 

strength (Partika, 2000). It should be displayed with a colour scale range between 

-1.0, in black, and 1.0, in white.  

 

(a) 

(b) 

Figure 55 – (a) Original seismic section and (b) extracted cosine of instantaneous phase. The 
green line represents a seismic reflector interpretation using Petrel’s “Seeded 2D Autotracking” 
tool. It is clearly that in (b) the interpretation is more consistent in space and close to what should 
be a manual interpretation. 

 

The cosine of instantaneous phase improves reflectors’ continuity and enhances 

the visual appearance of edges, such as faults and stratigraphic boundaries.  It is 

an indicative attribute about stratigraphic terminations, lateral variations and 



Chapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 

79 

seismic facies variations. Due to the improved reflectors continuity it is an 

excellent attribute to constrain automatic interpretation tools (Figure 55) since 

poorly resolved seismic reflectors, which often lead to missinterpretations, become 

more consistent. 

 

The stratigraphic analysis and seismic pattern recognition is one of the hardest 

tasks to the interpreter but also one of the most important to infer the depositional 

regime which affected a sedimentary basin. Stratigraphic analysis is often based 

on interpretation of reflectors terminations, which are more easily identified with 

cosine of instantaneous phase volume (Figure 56). 

(a) (b) 

Figure 56 – Seismic stratigraphic analysis becomes easier with the cosine of instantaneous phase 
attribute. (a) Green lines are interpreted reflectors which are being truncated by the red one. (b) 
Shows a typical turbidite system feature, the “seagull wing”, corresponding to flood events of the 
interpreted channel. 

 

IV.3.2.5. Instantaneous Frequency 

 

Instantaneous frequency is described as the rate of change in time of 

instantaneous phase (Equation 21) over a user-defined window. It is an attribute 

independent of amplitude and phase information and represents the instantaneous 

centered frequency, or mean frequency of the frequency spectrum (Taner et al., 

1979). 

 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

80 

Negative values of instantaneous frequency are related to phase angle reversals, 

which automatically are transformed into zero values, by the algorithm which 

computes this attribute in Petrel 2008.1 (Schlumberger, 2007a). 

 

Most of the recorded reflections in seismic data are not produced from a single 

geological reflection but they are the sum of reflections from closely spaced 

reflectors. These closely spaced reflectors have little differences in acoustic 

impedance between themselves and then the superimposition of individual 

reflections produce a frequency pattern which characterizes the composite 

reflection. Lateral and vertical variations in lithology can be identified by the 

change of the composite pattern (Taner et al. 1979, Chen et al. 1997).  

 

 

Figure 57 – Time slice of an instantaneous frequency cube. In the central part, an E-W channel 
which extends to the right part of the figure is clearly distinguished, by constant values of 
instantaneous frequency. Part of a salt body orientated NW-SE can also be identified in the lower 
left corner. 

 

Instantaneous frequency is typically used to enhance vertical and lateral variations 

of lithologies. Channels are easier to identify in instantaneous frequency time 

slices because this attribute tends to be constant in value inside the potential 

hydrocarbon reservoir when compared to the surrounding environment (Figure 

57). This effect happens when there are no major lithological variations inside the 

channel, contrasting to the abrupt lithological variations outside the channel 

borders. This method is also useful to detect fracture zones and as a Direct 

Hydrocarbon Indicator (DHI). Faults and fractures also often cause absorption 



Chapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 

81 

effects causing low values of instantaneous frequency, just like salt bodies (Figure 

58). Sands with gas or oil content within the pores also usually cause drop-off high 

frequencies just below the hydrocarbon reservoir – this effect is frequently called 

“low-frequency shadow” (Taner et al., 1979; Chen and Sidney, 1997).  

 

To correctly interpret Instantaneous Fequency attribute volumes the colour scale 

range to display this attribute should be adjusted from zero to a maximum value 

close to 65 Hz, depending on frequency component of the seismic data.  

 

(a) (b) 

Figure 58 – (a) Seismic sections with original amplitude and (b) extracted instantaneous frequency 
attribute. Instantaneous frequency enhances faults and better delineates salt bodies, due to the 
characteristic low values of instantaneous frequency. Colour scale bar is shown in the lower left 
corner of (b). 

 

IV.3.2.6. Instantaneous Bandwidth 

 

Instantaneous bandwidth, expressed in Hertz, by Equation 22, is mathematically 

described as the absolute value of the derivative of the envelope with time divided 

by the envelope, over a user-defined window. This attribute symbolizes the 

standard deviation of the instantaneous power spectrum about its mean. 

 

 Eq. (22) 

Where d[(env(t)/dt) is called the decay factor. 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

82 

 

Figure 59 – Time slice from an instantaneous bandwidth attribute volume, same time position of 
the time slice displayed for instantaneous frequency (Figure 57) focused in the E-W channel. The 
central part of the channel is now better imaged as well as the lateral lithological variations inside 
the channel, that can be correlated with abrupt changes in instantaneous bandwidth values.  

 

This attribute should be interpreted combined with the dominant frequency (see 

Section IV.3.2.7) and the instantaneous frequency attributes. Compared to the 

instantaneous frequency attribute, instantaneous bandwidth commonly gives lower 

frequency values. The output attribute cube has enhanced features related to 

absorption effects and changes in the seismic character, which are directly related 

to changes in lithology (Figure 59). This attribute is also useful to correlate seismic 

units from both sides of a fault.  

 

The maximum value of the colour scale bar should be adjusted in order to achieve 

a convenient display, depending on the acquisition frequency. 

 

IV.3.2.7. Dominant Frequency 

 

Dominant frequency is the last attribute which combined with instantaneous 

frequency and instantaneous bandwidth characterizes the time varying spectral 

properties of seismic data. 

 



Chapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 

83 

The algorithm used to compute this attribute sums the square of the instantaneous 

frequency with the square of instantaneous bandwidth and calculates the square 

root of the sum (Equation 23) over a user-defined window. This represents the 

RMS frequency of the amplitude spectrum.  

 Eq. (23) 

Combining the three attributes related to the instantaneous power spectrum is the 

best way to look for low frequency shadows which can indicate a potential oil and 

gas reservoir, and distinguish channels and salt bodies from the seismic 

background (Figure 60).  

 

 

Figure 60 - Time slice from dominant frequency cube, same time position as shown in 
instantaneous frequency and bandwidth. Comparing the three attributes lateral changes in geology 
inside the channel are better characterized, as well as the seismic signature for a salt body. 

 

Once again the colour bar should be adjusted with the frequency component of the 

input seismic data. When combined to instantaneous frequency and bandwidth 

attributes the same coulour scale should be used for the three attributes; 

otherwise the desired result will not be achieved, causing missinterpretation. 

 

IV.3.2.8. Quadrature Amplitude 

 

This attribute calculates the imaginary part, f*(t), of the original seismic trace f(t). 

The imaginary part is computed through the Hilbert transformation by phase 

shifting the original seismic trace by 90º, in a clockwise direction. For further 

information, see Section IV.3.1.1.  



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs

IV.3.3. Structural Attributes Library 

 

The Structural Attributes library contains a collection of attributes to help the 

structural geology interpretation process. They are mainly used to isolate and 

enhance local structural variations in the seismic reflection patterns. In other 

words, structural attributes detect edges, compute the local orientation and dip of 

seismic reflectors and enhance seismic event continuity parallel to the estimated 

bedding orientation. In structural attributes, an edge is defined as a discontinuity in 

the horizontal amplitude continuity within the seismic data, that can correspond to 

real faults and/or fractures. 

 

Unlike attributes from the Complex Trace library, most of the algorithms used to 

compute structural attributes are computed using a collection of traces, by the 

multi-trace method described in Section IV.3. 

 

The main attributes available in this library are described below: Dip Deviation; 

Local Structural Azimuth; Local Structural Dip; Structural Smoothing; Variance; Ant 

Tracking and Gradient Magnitude.  

 

IV.3.3.1. Dip Deviation 

 

Dip deviation is a multi-trace-based seismic attribute that tracks rapid changes in 

the local orientation of seismic reflectors; these rapid changes can be interpreted 

as edges. The dip deviation algorithm considers the difference between the dip 

trend and the instantaneous dip. Dip estimates are computed from the local 

maxima of the input seismic data and from the maxima of the derivative of the 

input data, which are then smoothed by a Gaussian smoothing operator. 

 

This method has proven results in passive margins and soft rocks where the 

downthrown side of a fault typically shows significant dip into the fault. It has also 

been found to work successfully for low-angle illumination. 

In Petrel, the user has the possibility to control the minimum dip difference to 

display trough a slider control, reducing the number of undesirable features.

Figure 61b shows a seismic section of dip deviation attribute volume. Major high 

angle faults can be identified and more easily interpreted, in the central part of the 

figure, minor faults, also became clearer and easy to interpret when combined with 

the original seismic data (Figure 61a). Since most of the fault features contain high 

angles the slider control was positioned to ignore dip deviations values less than 

10º.

attribute.

IV.3.3.2. Local Structural Azimuth and Dip 

 

In stratigraphic hydrocarbon reservoirs one of the challenges of today is the 

interpretation of upper and lower unit boundaries of a hydrocarbon indicator and 

their correlation with seismic reflectors configuration. The internal configuration, or 

seismic texture, is another challenge which new seismic attributes are trying to 

identify and interpret automatically, especially after the introduction of 3D seismic 

data and volume attributes (Randen et al., 2000). 

 

Local structural azimuth and dip are more than simply attributes to estimate the 

azimuth and dip of coherent seismic events. They are also used in Petrel as 

internal algorithms to compute other seismic attributes which honor the orientation 

of the seismic reflectors. Seismic attributes are normally extracted vertically along 

the seismic trace; this traditional approach can, in many cases, introduce artifacts. 

The two attributes described here are part of a class of attributes to avoid these 

artifacts and ensure that the extracted seismic attributes are invariant to dip and 

azimuth (Randen et al., 2000). 

 

Geologically, in terms of atitude, strike is defined as the compass bearing of a 

horizontal line on a dipping layer, and dip is the angle of the inclination of the bed 

measured perpendicular to the strike direction. In Petrel, dip has the same 

definition, but azimuth is generally used rather than strike. Azimuth is a 

perpendicular measure to the strike, and is the compass direction (0-360º) of the 

normal to the plane (Figure 62). 

 

 

Figure 62 - How dip and azimuth are measured in Petrel 2008.1 (Schlumberger, 2007a). 



Chapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 

87 

Local structural azimuth and dip can be computed following three different 

computation methods with different complexities: (1) Gradient; (2); Event (3) 

Principal Component (Figure 64).  

 

(1) Gradient is the instantaneous azimuth/dip in the sample neighborhood and it is 

the simplest method to estimate local structural azimuth and dip. It consists in 

calculating the gradient vector using a different operator for each of the three 

dimensions of space (inline and crossline directions, and vertically in time) by the 

same approximation of the first derivative attribute defined in Section IV.3.1.1. The 

calculated gradient vector is normal to the considered seismic event; in other 

words, it is its tangent. Dip is measured from the z-axis to the gradient vector, and 

the azimuth is the angle of the vertical projection of the gradient vector measured 

clockwise from the inline axis. Local structural azimuth ranges from 0º to 360º and 

dip from -90º to 90º. 

 

(2) Event method computes the downslope azimuth and dip of the estimated 

event. Numerically it calculates the gradient, using the same approximation of the 

gradient method (see previous point) but, by convention, the event normal, or 

gradient vector, should always point upwards. In comparison to the gradient 

method, and using the positive z downwards, if the gradient vector has a negative 

z-component, then dip and azimuth are equal to dip and azimuth computed by the 

gradient method. On the other hand, if the computed gradient has a z-component 

positive (pointing downwards) then it should be reversed by multiplying by zero all 

the components, before measuring the angles. This explains the fact that azimuth 

ranges over 360º and dip from 0º to 90º. 

 

(3) Principal component is a three step method which consists first in the 

estimation of the gradient vector, the local gradient covariance matrix and a 

principal component analysis. Dip/azimuth vectors should behave like the event 

method: the principal vector should point upwards before measuring the angles; 

azimuth and dip ranges from 0º to 360º and 0º to 90º, respectively. 

In discrete data there are several derivative approximations in gradient 

computation. In the principal component method the derivative of Gaussian is 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

88 

used due to joint optimum resolution in time and frequency of Gaussian filters and 

nice scalability properties.  

 

For 3D datasets, in order to obtain the derivative of each dimension, a three-

dimensional gradient, the derivative of Gaussian is applied to achieve a gradient 

vector with one partial derivative component for each dimension (Equation 24). 

 Eq. (24) 

The gradient vector computed from this step represents the local azimuth and dip 

of the seismic event but can be contaminated by noise and other artifacts. The 

local gradient covariance matrix estimation, C(t1,t2,t3), is computed instead to 

smooth and eliminate artificial features within the gradient estimate. Smoothing 

wraparound effects (slightly changes in angles, but abrupt changes in its 

representation, changing from -180º to +180º) in dip and azimuth estimates are 

non-trivial. The used approximation is to estimate the covariance matrix of the 

gradient vectors and determine the dip as the direction of the principal eigenvector 

of the matrix (Figure 63; Randen, 2000). For further details and mathematical 

descriptions about this method it is suggested Iske and Randen (2005).

89 

Dip and azimuth estimations, by the principal component method, are powerful 

tools not only in the estimation itself, as an attribute, but also to compensate for 

dip and azimuth in other seismic attributes algorithms.

gradient method; (b) event method and (c) principal component method. 

 

IV.3.3.3. Gradient Magnitude 

 

By definition, gradient magnitude is the square root of the sum of the squared first 

derivatives, computed following the mathematical expression given by Equation 

25, in the three dimensions of space (inline, crossline and vertical directions).  

 Eq. (25) 

Gradient magnitude is an amplitude-sensitive attribute; therefore it can be useful to 

discriminate areas of weak signal from those with significant reflectivity. Based on 

the coherency of the signal, and the attribute value, it can be used to distinguish 

different lithologies (Figure 65). Interpreting time slices with this attribute can add 

valuable clues on fault systems and depositional regimes (Figure 66).

Gradient magnitude attribute produces sharper features and distinguish regions with signal 
strength from those with weak signal content. The noise content is also reduced in the output 
attribute volume. 



Chapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 

91 

Gradient magnitude does not accept user-defined parameters. In order to adjust 

the attribute with the data, the interpreter should use a template with two colours 

associated with the extreme values, and limit the colour scale range. This best 

practice can bring out different features from seismic data.

shown the potential of this attribute in fault enhancement and detection, (b) shows a system of 
ancient channels related to a deep-sea turbidite system. Salt bodies are also identified, although 
their boundaries are not well defined. 

 

IV.3.3.4. Structural Smoothing 

 

Structural smoothing is a fast volumetric signal processing method that applies a 

3D Gaussian filter to reduce the noise content of the input data. This attribute 

performs a structure-orientated filtering since it takes into account bed estimated 

orientations, by the principal component estimation method (see Section IV.3.3.2). 

A structure-orientated filter reduces the noise content without loosing information 

related to edges within the data. 

Nowadays, the time spent in seismic data interpretation is considerably reduced 

when compared to the past. Costumers want fast responses with robust 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

92 

interpretations and reliable geological models which best fit the seismic data with 

the less time-consumption possible. In addition, if in the past most of the 

interpreters were geophysicists they have been mostly replaced by geologists that, 

if by one hand are able to build best geological models, by the other hand have 

more difficulties in distinguishing noise from real data, and have little knowledge of 

seismic data processing and artifacts (Fehmers and Hocker, 2003). Fast 

volumetric signal processing attributes, and the ones described in IV.3.1, are part 

of the available tools in Petrel 2008.1 to help the geoscientist to improve the 

signal-to-noise ratio and make the interpretation easier. 

 

The Gaussian filter can be applied with different settings to reduce spatial noise 

and improve reflectors continuity. In Petrel 2008.1, the structural smoothing dialog 

box allows the user to active the checkboxes “Dip-guide”, “Enhance Edges” and 

select the multi-trace window size within which the attribute is computed. “Dip-

guide” computes the local orientation of the reflector and applies the filter 

considering the estimated orientation (bedding orientation is estimated following 

the method described in Section IV.3.3.2). This option will improve both vertical 

and horizontal resolution (Randen et al., 2003). “Enhance edges” enhance and 

sharpen the presence of edges, detected by computing the instability of the 

structure, through the chaos attribute (Section IV.3.4.1). 

 

In Petrel 2008.1, the Gaussian smoothing operator has the following expression 

(Iske and Randen (2005) in Schlumberger, 2007a): 

 Eq. (26) 

? determines the width of the smoothing filter; the size of the smoothing window 

(?) is a user-defined parameter which can be adjustable to the data in inline, 

crossline and time directions independently through a slider control. ? has an 

allowable range of 0.0 – 5.0 and can be converted easily to an approximate value 

in number of traces or vertical samples by: 

 Eq. (27) 

The structural smoothing cube is perfectly to condition seismic data to use in 

automatic interpretation tools, since the reflectors’ continuity is enhanced leading 



Chapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 

93 

to increased picking stability. “Dip-guide” and “Enhance edge” options, when 

activated, highlight faults and other vertical linear anomalies within the data 

facilitating the structural interpretation process (Figure 67).

“Dip-guide” checkbox selected, same effect as applying a 3D Gaussian smoothing filter only; (c) 
structural smoothing honoring estimated bed orientation and automatically detecting edges. 

 

Due to the many advantages of structural smoothing, this is the best choice to use 

as part of Ant Tracking workflow (see Section IV.3.3.6) during the seismic 

conditioning step.  

 

IV.3.3.5. Variance 

 

In probabilistic analysis, variance is the measure of how spread is the dataset 

around the mean value Equation 28  



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

94 

 Eq. (28) 

Based on this statistical definition, Petrel 2008.1 uses the patented algorithm 

introduced by van Bemmel et al. (2000) to compute a normalized population 

variance with an optional weighted vertical smoothing. The variance attribute uses 

an algorithm which computes the local variance of the input signal through a multi-

trace window with user-defined size. 

 Eq. (29) 

Where xij is the sample value at horizontal position, i, and j is the vertical time 

sample. wj-t is the vertical smoothing term over a window of length L. 

 

“The Semblance Cube” and “The Coherency Cube”, the later introduced by 

Bahorich and Farmer (1995), are common attributes in the oil and gas industry to 

map discontinuities. The algorithm of variance is innovative because it measures 

directly, without the need of an intermediate step, differences from a mean value. 

The direct measurement produces sharper results, when compared to other edge 

detection methods. 

 

The variance attribute is an edge imaging and detection method. The window size 

is the critical parameter to obtain discontinuities as sharp as possible. Long 

vertical windows produce vertical stripping while short window lengths produce 

horizontal stripping when variance is displayed in cross-sections (Figure 68). The 

size of the window can be adjusted in inline/crossline and vertical directions 

independently. Different values for each of the first two directions can really bring 

out depositional features which have a preferential directions in space (e.g. non-

meandering channels).

window of 3x3 traces in inline/crossline directions and 15 ms in time. The horizontal stripping on (b) 
is due to the short vertical window.  

 

Short vertical time windows transform the variance attribute from a simply 

structural attribute into a good stratigraphic attribute, where depositional features, 

such as reefs, channels and splays, are enhanced (Figure 69). The interpretation 

of variance should be done preferentially in time slices along the attribute cube. 

This spatial visualization allows the interpreter to better understand the distribution 

of faults, channels and other geological features of interest that can be an active 

part in a possible petroleum system.

features; (d) window of 5x5 traces in inline/crossline directions and 65 ms of vertical length show 
imprecise depositional feature boundaries and less defined faults.  

 

IV.3.3.6. Ant Tracking 

 

The Ant Tracking attribute is a patent-protected algorithm from Schlumberger that 

introduces a new paradigm in fault interpretation. Fault interpretation is still a 

manual, time consuming and very subjective task to the interpreter, and 

consequently difficult to perform accurately. With this new technique, edges 



Chapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 

97 

(faults, fractures and other linear anomalies) are automatically enhanced, following 

a standard workflow. The enhanced edges are then automatically or manually 

interpreted (or extracted; Pedersen et al., 2002). 

 

An Ant Tracking attribute volume is generated using swarm intelligent concepts 

where real ants colonies looking for food are mimicked. Real ants use 

pheromones to mark their paths in order to optimize the search for food (Figure 

70). In comparison, Ant Tracking uses a high number of agents (virtual ants) which 

are deployed over a seismic discontinuity volume to look for fault zones. “Virtual 

pheromones” are deployed by these agents when they find a fault zone, resulting 

in an attribute volume that shows fault zones in sharp detail. This high level of 

detail is achieved because virtual ants deployed over noisy areas or where there is 

a surface that does not fulfill the conditions for a fault (e.g. remains of a reflector) 

are terminated shortly or immediately, not deploying “virtual pheromones” 

(Schlumberger, 2007b). 

 

 
(a) (b) 

Figure 70 – (a) Diagram showing two ants starting at the same time at the nest looking for food. (b) 
The ant which chooses the shortest path, the straight one (black dashed line), will arrive before the 
ant choosing the longest path (green dashed line). Therefore, the shorter path will be marked with 
more pheromones than the longer one, hence the next ant is more likely to choose the shortest 
path (modified from Pedersen, 2002). 

 

In order to produce the fault seismic cube there are several volume seismic 

attributes which need to be computed in a chain, where the output from each one 

will be the input for the next process. Generally speaking, the required steps in Ant 

Tracking are: (1) seismic conditioning, to reduce the spatial noise present in the 

original data; (2) generation of an edge detection cube; (3) calculation of an edge 

enhancement volume, which is the Ant Tracking cube itself (Figure 71). 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

98 

 

Figure 71 - Ant tracking general workflow (modified from Schlumberger, 2007a). 

 

 From the Ant Tracking cube, faults can be automatic extracted through Petrel’s 

“Automatic Fault Extraction” process, manually interpreted by the traditional way, 

or by seeding points to build patches with the Petrel’s “Automatic Fault Extraction” 

process active; these patches can be later transformed into fault interpretations in 

order to be inserted in the hydrocarbon reservoir model (Figure 72).  

 

Seismic conditioning is used to reduce spatial noise within the data, enhancing 

reflectors continuity and honoring edges. The structural smoothing attribute is 

normally the seismic attribute extracted in this step. In the edge detection stage, 

the variance cube is normally used, which is an attribute data and structural 

dependent; therefore, it should be extracted from seismic data with as less noise 

as possible, without losing information about discontinuities. Finally, the edge 

enhancement is performed with the realization of the Ant Tracking attribute. The 

resulting output can be combined with the original seismic data and/or an edge 

detection cube in fault interpretation. 



Chapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 

99 

There are many user-defined parameters to adjust the deployment of the ant 

agents. The settings should be chosen to fit the conceptual model about the 

structural system of the area built by the interpreter as a first approach. A brief 

description of these parameters are summarized in the Table I and have by default 

two configurations depending on the desired detail level. “Passive Ants” should be 

used as a first approach to understand the major regional structural system, since 

the Ant Tacking cube will enhance faults with a low level of detail; only strong 

major regional faults will be detected with low resolution in the fault extraction. 

“Aggressive Ants” are used to deploy a large number of ants in the seismic cube 

and capture faults in a high level of detail; in this case major and subtle faults from 

the data will be extracted, leading to high resolution on fault extraction. 

 

 

Figure 72 - Ant Tracking time slice combined with the original seismic data to perform the 
"Automatic Fault Extraction" using seeding points. Colour surfaces are fault patches to be used in 
the geological model. 

 

Apart from these parameters, in Petrel, the user can also use the Stereonet tab. 

This option works as an orientation filter which allows the user to exclude specified 

orientations from the output volume. With this tab the interpreter can easily 

separate two different fault systems or eliminate footprints present within the data; 

since virtual ants will not be deployed within the rejected areas. The Stereonet is 

oriented to the inline survey direction. To reject specified dip and azimuth angles in 

Petrel (estimated using the methods described in IV.3.3.2) the user should click 

over the desired areas and switch them to grey (Figure 73).

Since the Ant Tracking attribute is a heavy processing operation it should be tried 

first in a small cropped cube where some of the principal discontinuities are clearly 

shown. If these features are enhanced after the ant tracking realization then the 

user can apply them to the entire dataset.  

 

Two tested workflows are proposed to compute the Ant Tracking cube. These two 

approaches differ mainly in the number of steps required and in the attribute used 

as edge detection method.

Figure 73 - Stereonet filter used to compute Ant Tracking cube. Red arrows represent how azimuth 
and dip are calculated. Grey areas represent rejected dip and azimuth ranges. 

 

Ant Tracking proposed workflows 

The first workflow discussed here is the simplest one. The first step is conditioning 

the original seismic data to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and enhance 

reflectors continuity honoring discontinuities orientation. The output attribute from 

this step is the structural smoothing cube (see Section IV.3.3.4). The user-defined 

size of the Gaussian filter should be enough to clean some residual noise within 

the data without losing information related to major discontinuities (Figure 67c). 

 

The structural smoothing volume is then used as an input to the edge detection 

step. Several attributes available in Petrel 2008.1 can be used (e.g. Chaos, 

Variance, Dip Deviation). In this workflow it is suggested to compute chaos (see 

Section IV.3.4.1) volume. For less experience users this may be particular useful 

since there are no user-defined parameters. The Ant Tracking attribute is applied 

to the chaos volume with ant parameters and a stereonet filter adjustable to the 

original seismic data. 

 

The second tested workflow is more complex than the first but generally achieves 

better results. For seismic conditioning a strong structural smoothing filter is used 

(e.g. with window of size 3x3x1.5), which will eliminate spatial noise, improving 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

102 

continuity without lost of edges information. This strong Gaussian smoothing filter, 

in Petrel, should honor seismic reflectors orientation and enhance edges, with the 

“Dip-guide” and “Enhance Edges” checkboxes selected. For the edge detection 

process it is suggested to use a variance cube (see IV.3.3.5) with tested 

parameters to best fit the data. This variance cube should define faults and other 

discontinuities with a high level of detail.  

 

The realized variance cube computed is now going to be used as an input to 

another structural smoothing attribute. This second smoothing is just a large 3D 

Gaussian smoothing filter realized with soft user-defined parameters without 

selecting the “Dip-guide” option. This step will eliminate possible noise created 

during the execution of the variance attribute. 

 

The data is then ready to be used as an input to the Ant Tracking attribute. This 

last step is repeated several times until the output cube has little noise content. 

The first Ant Tracking pass should be computed with parameters which reflect 

more aggressive ants. These first run should detect both major and minor fault 

systems. The output cube will have enhanced real faults and other linear 

discontinuities with less detail. The Ant Tracking cube is then used as an input to 

another Ant Tracking algorithm extraction, this time with less aggressive ants. 

Computing the Ant Tracking attribute over the same attribute cube will detect only 

real faults associated to strong signals, thereby eliminating noisy features. If in the 

final the output is good enough to extract the faults in a precise way the workflow 

is terminated; if not, more Ant Tracking passes should be used. This cascade 

edge enhancement reinforces strong features in the volume and reduces the 

contribution of minor features, leading to better final results for fault interpretation. 

 

The figure below shows a comparison of the two workflows for a random seismic 

intersection. The figure from the right was computed using the longer workflow. 

Faults are more consistent in space and well defined improving the 

inpterpretablity.

IV.3.4. Stratigraphic Attributes Library 

 

Identifying stratigraphic features from seismic data is one of the most difficult tasks 

in the design of a reliable geological model. Furthermore, the study of stratigraphic 

events is important to understand how the petroleum system of an oil and/or gas 

reservoir works. Stratigraphic Attributes comprise attributes related to the 

identification of stratigraphic sequences, lateral and vertical variations of 

lithologies, structural orientation measurements, frequency decomposition and 

facies distribution. 

 

IV.3.4.1. Chaos 

 

As the name suggests, the chaos attribute is related to the “lack of organization” 

within a 3D window. This attribute measures how consistent is the dip and azimuth 

orientation estimated using the principal component method (described in IV.3.3.2; 

Schlumberger, 2007b). Estimated measurements with low consistency are related 

to a chaotic signal pattern. Chaotic patterns are used to enhance faults, 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

104 

discontinuities, salt bodies, and reflectors with chaotic texture which are often 

associated with channel infill or reef textures (Figure 75).  

 

(a) (b) 

Figure 75 - (a) Chaos attribute in a time slice and (b) in a seismic section. In (a) the yellow line 
represents the position of the seismic vertical intersection. The light green line represents the 
position of the time slice shown in (b). In the time slice can be identified; a well defined channel 
system and a clear salt dome delineation can be observed. In (b) the three major features that 
chaos attribute is able to enhance can be identified: faults/discontinuities, salt bodies and chaotic 
texture within reflectors.  

 

Another important characteristic of the chaos attribute is that it is invariant with 

amplitude and orientation; therefore it will produce consistent results in areas with 

high or low amplitudes, and dipping or non-dipping events. The output data range 

is scaled between 0, corresponding to non-consistent areas, and 1, for consistent 

areas. 

 

Due to the potential of chaos for edge detection, it is commonly used as part of the 

simple Ant Tracking workflow already discussed in Section IV.3.3.6. 

 

IV.3.4.2. Local Flatness 

 

The local flatness attribute is at the same time a stratigraphic (related to seismic 

textures) and a structural attribute, it is also used to enhance faults and other 



Chapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 

105 

vertical anomalies (Figure 76). This attribute gives information about the flatness 

of the local seismic signal, within a 3D window of user-defined size; the size of the 

window is defined by adjusting the same ? parameter of the structural smoothing 

attribute (see Section IV.3.3.4). 

 

This attribute is a two step algorithm. First, it measures the local orientation by the 

principal component method (see Section IV.3.3.2); then it computes the 

normalized variance on the estimated orientation vector, following the method 

described in Section IV.3.3.5. Flatness does not refer to horizontal and non-

dipping seismic events; it is the degree to which the local estimation is planar. If it 

is planar there are no discontinuities; if not an edge is detected. The output cube is 

scaled between 0 to 1, meaning locally planar and non-planar, respectively. 

 

To transform the local flatness attribute invariant with amplitude, showing high 

reflectivity seismic events such as low reflectivity features, local flatness should be 

computed using an invariant attribute volume (e.g. cosine of instantaneous phase) 

as an input. 

 

 

Figure 76 - Time slice from a local flatness attribute volume. This attribute can be considered both 
a stratigraphic and a structural attribute. It should be interpreted in time slices rather than seismic 
sections and enhances not only features related to seismic texture and channels infill, but also 
structural events such as faults and salt bodies.

IV.3.4.3. Iso-Frequency 

 

The Iso-Frequency Component generates a volume attribute through a patented 

seismic decomposition method for user-defined frequencies (Pepper and van 

Bemmel (2001), in Schlumberger, 2007a). 

 

The spectral decomposition is performed locally and consists first in generating an 

autocorrelation function of the seismic data on a short time window. The 

autocorrelation function is insensitive to the phase content of the original seismic 

data, thus aligning the seismic energy at zero lag. The second step is a cross-

correlation between a cosine wave (cosine correlation transform (CCT) method), 

with a user-defined number of cycles, and the auto-correlation function generated 

before, to determine the numeric similarity of the auto-correlation function and the 

cosine wave. The cross-correlation algorithm is defined by: 

 

Eq. (30) 

Where G(k) and H(k) are the two signals being correlated: either the windowed 

original seismic data to build the auto-correlation function, or the cosine function 

and the auto-correlation function. 

 

The CCT method output value is a correlation coefficient which measures the 

correlation between a known cosine wave signature of a specific frequency and 

the auto-correlation seismic data. The output attribute cube is scaled between -1 

to 1. Zero values mean uncorrelated functions. 1 is for identical signal and 

negative values have the same meaning as positive values but indicates inverted 

polarities.  

 

Besides the cosine frequency, in Petrel, the user has also the option to select a 

desired “Number of cycles”; this option defines the window length where the 

attribute is extracted. The window length depends both on the relative frequency of 

the cosine function and the frequency content of the original seismic data.

(b) 

Figure 77 – Same time slice position for two Iso-Frequency volumes computed with a cosine wave 
of (a) 25 Hz and (b) 45 Hz. When (a) and (b) are compared, it is clear that inside the meandering 
channel there are different values for the correlation, which may indicate changes in lithology inside 
it. In (a), inside the green polygon, it is inferred that the value close to 0 is related to an abrupt 
change in lithology when compared to the lithology inside the channel. This feature will be 
interpreted further in this work, in Chapter V. 

 

Short windows will not focus the correlation energy to illuminate anomalies, while 

too long windows will show local geologic effects and not tuning effects. There is 

also the option “Spectral Normalization” which performs a spectral whitening and 

attempts to remove the signature of the seismic wavelet from the results. 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

108 

The Iso-Frequency attribute volume may reveal subtle variations in lithology that 

may indicate stratigraphic traps for hydrocarbons. If an interesting feature is 

identified at a designated frequency the resulting cube may represent similar 

features with the same frequency signature that may not be identified in the 

original seismic data. The Iso-Frequency cube helps to identify similar 

features/facies already correlated to potential hydrocarbon reservoir features in 

other areas within the data. Similar methods of spectral decomposition are 

becoming standard available attributes in most of the interpretation software 

suites. 

 

IV.3.4.4. Relative Acoustic Impedance 

 

Acoustic impedance (Z) is an intrinsic physical property of rocks, defined as the 

density of the geologic formation multiplied by the propagation velocity of p-waves 

through that formation (Equation 31). 

 Eq. (31) 

To measure the real value for acoustic impedance it is necessary to use seismic 

inversion methods. However, in 1992, Taner demonstrated that Relative Acoustic 

Impedance (RAI) can be expressed and computed integrating the real part of the 

seismic trace (Equation 33). This method assumes that the input seismic data has 

been processed to have reduced noise and multiple contamination, and also that it 

contains zero phase and large bandwidth. Based on this assumption the seismic 

trace represents the band limited reflective series Equation 32. The integration of 

the seismic trace will provide a band-limited estimate of the natural log of the 

acoustic impedance. Since the integration is band-limited, the impedance will not 

have absolute magnitude values, and consequently is only relative. 

 Eq. (32) 

 Eq. (33) 

A Butterworth filter is then applied to remove long wavelength trends originated 

from the integration process (Schlumberger, 2007a). 



Chapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 

109 

 Eq. (34) 

Petrel 2008.1 uses a filter with the following parameters: BL(f) is the band-limited 

signal in frequency; fH  is the frequency cutoff and has a value of 10Hz and the 

filter order (N) is 3. 

 

RAI is not an exhaustive inversion process, since the output volume only reflects 

the apparent acoustic impedance contrasts, or physical property contrasts. 

Relative acoustic impedance is used in many calibration procedures since it 

mimics the natural log of the acoustic impedance. In interpretation, it is combined 

with the original seismic data to indicate sequences boundaries, associated with 

high contrasts in Z values, unconformity surfaces and discontinuities (Figure 78). It 

may be also related with porosity within the formations and the presence of fluid 

content inside a hydrocarbon reservoir.  

 

(a) (b) 

Figure 78 – (a) Input seismic data and (b) computed relative acoustic impedance attribute. High 
contrasts between values of RAI highlights sequences boundaries. Here too, the bottom of some 
ancient channels are better interpreted in (b). 

 

IV.3.4.5. Neural Network 

 

The Neural network attribute allows the creation of an attribute classification 

volume based on a pre-conceived estimation model, created by Petrel’s “Train 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

110 

Estimation Model” process found under “Utilities” (Schlumberger, 2007b). In this 

work an unsupervised estimation model for facies classification was tested using 

as input the original seismic cube and derived seismic volume attributes. 

 

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) can be defined as information processing 

algorithms that try to mimic the human brain. Unlike conventional computation 

algorithms that always follow the same programmed steps independently of the 

input data, neural networks learn by trial, using a set of inputs, and so are not 

programmed to perform a specific task (http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk). 

 

Biological neural networks are made of billions of neurons interconnected, building 

extremely complex information networks. Many processes of how information is 

processed within the human brain are still a “black box” to the science community, 

although it is known that neurons are the main components of the human brain. A 

neuron is a specialized cell with the ability to propagate an electrical signal and 

has a well known basic structure and operation method. Human neurons are 

composed of four parts: the nucleus, the dendrites, the axon, and the synapse 

(Figure 79). Dendrites are fine structures which receive electrical signals from 

other neurons transmitting the signal into the cell body, acting like a branching 

input. The axon is the output connection for electrical pulses emitted by the neuron 

which splits into thousands of branches. At the end of each branch the synapses 

are the connections between neurons. Synapses receive the activity from the axon 

and convert it into an electrical effect that inhibits or excites the activity in the next 

connected neuron. If the neuron receives excitatory input sufficiently large when 

compared with its inhibitory input, it sends a spike of electrical activity down its 

axon. The human learning process occurs by changes in the effectiveness 

response of the synapses, i.e. changes in the influence of one neuron on another 

(Schlumberger personal communication, www.statsoft.com, www.doc.ic.ac.uk). 

 

ANN use the same principle described in the previous paragraph based on 

artificial neurons, with simpler configuration. Artificial neurons are processing units 

interconnected in a complex communication network working together to solve a 

specific task. They receive a set of inputs, which can be fed from multiple sources, 



Chapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 

111 

which are then multiplied by a weight. The weighting result is summed and is 

passed through a transfer function returning one or more outputs.  

 

 

Figure 79 - Diagram of a human neuron and its components: Nucleus; Axon; Dendrites and 
synapse (modified from www.doc.ic.ac.uk). 

 

Petrel 2008.1 uses feed-forward networks ANN, the output of any processor unit is 

not an input to other processor unit. Each input (X(n)) is received by artificial 

neurons  similar to dendrites. Then a weighted sum of the inputs from all the units 

is computed. The importance of the input (X(n)) is measured by the weight of the 

connection (W(n)). The output is 1 or 0 according to whether the weighted sum is 

above or below a certain threshold. The neuron is adapted to a particular situation 

adjusting the values of the weights and the threshold value (Figure 80; 

Schlumberger personal communication; www.doc.is.ac.uk).  

 

The learning process method is another key factor to achieve the best possible 

result. Petrel uses adaptive networks, since ANN are able to change their weights 

depending on the input (www.doc.is.ac.uk). There are two ways of adaptive 

training: supervised and unsupervised. Training supervised neural networks is only 

possible when there are available training data. The training data combined with 

the input data are used to optimize the weights for each input. The computed data 

from the neural network is constantly compared with the training data to give the 

error of the estimation. This method is normally used in facies estimation using 

well log data as training data and seismic attributes as input data.  

Unsupervised trained neural networks are those where there are not available 

training data. The output is given in terms of classification, based on a probabilistic 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

112 

analysis of the input data. The input points are plotted in “n” dimensions, where “n” 

is the number of pieces of input data. Using the Competitive Learning Algorithm 

the centre of points of each class are first distributed randomly then adjusted to fit 

the input data. The process subdivides the input data into a number of user-

defined classes and it self-organizes it, detecting collective properties between 

them. This method is normally used with the purpose of discovering the underlying 

structure of the data, encode, compress or transform the data (Schlumberger, 

2007b; www. www.doc.ic.ac.uk). 

 

 

Figure 80 - Schematic representation of how a virtual neuron used by Petrel 2008.1 works 
(modified from www.doc.is.ac.uk). 

 

Using neural networks has particular benefits when the final goal is the recognition 

of seismic patterns and data classification. 

 

Workflow to compute an unsupervised Neural Network in Petrel 2008.1 

Before computing the neural network attribute it is necessary to build an estimation 

model using the “Train Estimation Model” process. This process takes the input 

data points with the associated seismic attributes and calculates an additional 

attribute, a seismic classification cube. The input data should be carefully chosen 

in order to increase the chances of success, reducing the processing time. To 

compute the facies classification cube pre-selected attribute volumes, extracted 

from the original seismic cube, were used as input data. The attribute selection 

can be done by two methods: (1) the correlation between attributes; (2) Principal 

Components Analysis (PCA). 

 



Chapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 

113 

(1) Before computing the estimation model, in order to classify seismic data into 

facies, it is first necessary to build an idea about which attributes are related to 

lithologies and seismic textures. From the previously described seismic attributes 

along this chapter there are a lot of potential cubes that can be selected. Attributes 

related to the energy and frequency content of the data, which give information 

about the distribution of the acoustic impedance along the cube, and finally 

spectral decomposition attributes are the natural choice of an expert user in a first 

approach.  

 

As stated before, a high number of input data can have the opposite effect of what 

one would assume, leading in most of the cases to an unsatisfactory final output. 

The input data should be cross-plotted against each other and should not have 

either a perfect correlation (Figure 81) or being uncorrelated. The plot should have 

a constant spatial distribution with points which can be group into families (Figure 

82). The attributes that exhibit this correlation rules are the ones that should be 

accepted. 

 

 

Figure 81 - Cross-plots of seismic attributes whit potential use in a neural network to create a 
facies classification cube. RMS amplitude Vs. Gradient magnitude attributes. The correlation 
between the two is perfect; therefore just one of these attributes should be used. 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

114 

 

Figure 82 - Shows a cross-plot between RMS amplitude and Iso-Frequency with 25 Hz. The 
correlation is optimal to use into an estimation model. The data correlation is distributed and can be 
grouped by classes, represented here by the four different colours. 

 

After the first trial of seismic attributes, the ones that show an acceptable behavior 

in the cross-plots should be selected in the “Train Estimation Model” process. 

They should be next passed through a correlation analysis for quality control, that 

is accessed in the process dialog box (Figure 84b). The analyzed attributes should 

have a correlation between 0.3 – 0.5 and present a cell box coloursed with green 

or light yellow in the correlation table (Figure 83). In Figure 83 blue cell boxes 

represent correlation values between 0 – 0.3, which means that the seismic 

attributes are not correlated; consequently they should not be used together in the 

“Train Estimation Model”. Red cell boxes symbolize seismic attributes highly 

correlated. As stated before too correlated attributes should not be used to train 

the neural network. Highly correlated seismic attributes enhance the same 



Chapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 

115 

characteristic of the original seismic data; therefore just one of the correlated 

attributes should be used. 

 

 

Figure 83 - Example of a correlation table from a correlation analysis between Iso-Frequency 
attributes, Envelope and Variance. Red and blue cell boxes are not desired in the “Train Estimation 
Model”. Green and light yellow represent acceptable correlation values. 

 

(2) Principal Component Analysis is a linear multivariable technique used to 

reduce the dimensionality of the input vectors helping to separate the necessary 

from the accessory in the input data before applying it into the estimation model. 

This method of data analysis overcomes the problems related to the graphically 

representation of n seismic attributes in n dimensions. In this case, it is not 

possible to analyze trends, highlight similarities and differences in the input data. 

PCA is a powerful tool to analyze the data and reduce the number of dimensions 

without loosing important information. Reducing the number of dimensions of the 

input data, using the PCA method, is a reliable solution to reduce the time-

consumption of the process, and help the neural network to reach a solution with 

less associated error. An example of PCA is shown in the in table Figure 84a, 

where Eigenvalues, ordered from the highest to the lowest value, give an 

indication of the relative importance of the Principal Components. Understanding 

the correlation between attributes and the contribution of each input data, Principal 

Components (PC) which contains less or less important information should be 

excluded. The PCs that have been passed through the quality control are then 

selected. 

 

The facies classification cube, computed by a neural network which has been 

trained by an estimation model build following the rules described above, is

presented in Section V.2.2, Figure 121. More details about which attributes were 

used in this case and how they were selected are also discussed in that Section.

IV.4. Surface Attributes 

 

A surface attribute is the value of an attribute relative to a single horizon and an 

interval window, between two horizons or within a constant time window. It can be 



Chapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 

117 

computed in Petrel using the “Surface Attributes” processes under “Geophysics”. 

Petrel 2008.1 has fifty surface attributes divided into four areas depending on the 

applied algorithm: Amplitude; Statistical; Signal Shape and Measurable Interval.  

 

In Petrel, surface attributes can only be computed in surfaces built from horizon 

interpretation. The process dialog box is divided into seven areas and the user can 

chose as many options to withdraw the maximum potential from the extensive list 

of available attributes. An example of the attributes dialog box to compute surface 

attributes is shown in Figure 85: (1) from the attribute library the user should 

choose the desired seismic attribute; (2) a seismic cube from where the attribute 

will be extracted needs to be set as input; (3) the attribute can be generated from 

three types of window specification: a) between a surface and a time window, 

“Single Horizon”; b) between two horizons, “Horizon-Horizon”; and c) inside a 

constant time window, “Z-Z”. After the window specification, a surface should be 

set as the input; 4) besides the type of window, the attribute can run above or 

below a user-defined length from a user-defined event. These events are “None”, 

“Largest Peak”, “Closest Peak”, “Largest Trough”, “Closest Trough”, “Zero 

Crossing +/- ”, or “Zero Crossing -/+”. If needed, a second surface, window 

specification, type of event and special parameters should be set up. 

 

Surface attributes are much more dependent on the user interpretation, and 

consequently dependent on the user picking of a horizon, than volume attributes 

computed with user-defined parameters. The subjective percentage related to this 

process can lead to misunderstood interpretations and the creation of artifacts in 

map attributes which are directly related to the picking interpretation (Figure 86).  

 

Depending on the hydrocarbon reservoir, surface attributes have different values 

in depositional regimes interpretation as they are computed from zero-phase 

seismic data or RAI data. For “top heavy” reservoirs, when there is a coarsening 

upward sequence from the bottom to the top, the more useful zero-phase attribute 

will be; on the other hand, the less “top heavy” is the hydrocarbon reservoir, the 

more RAI attributes will be useful (Schlumberger, 2007a). 

 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

118 

In this thesis only three surface attributes, all related to energy content of the 

seismic data, are described. 

 

 

Figure 85 – Petrel’s Surface Attributes process dialog box. 

 

 

Figure 86 - Interpreted horizon and RMS amplitude attribute computed over a window of 5 ms 
below the horizon. Comparing with another horizon interpretations, very high values of RMS 
amplitude are interpreted as artifacts related to a poor picking stability. High Values in the center of 
the horizon can be interpreted as high porosity sands. 



Chapter IV Seismic Attributes in Petrel 2008.1 

119 

IV.4.1. RMS Amplitude 

 

RMS amplitude is the same attribute described in Section IV.3.1.8 but computed 

relative to a surface with all the user-defined settings as discussed before. 

Attributes maps of RMS amplitude may isolate amplitude response features from 

the background (Figure 86), or act as a direct hydrocarbon indicator. 

 

IV.4.2. Extract Value 

 

The extract value attribute is more like a valuable utility than a seismic attribute in 

the truly meaning of the word. This attribute allows the user to extract the value of 

a seismic attribute volume relative to a single surface. It allows the production of 

surface attribute maps of attributes that are not available in the surface attributes 

library.  

 

IV.4.3. Half Energy 

 

The half energy attribute computes the time or depth required for the energy within 

a window to reach one-half of the total energy of the entire window, throughout 

(Equation 35). 

 Eq. (35) 

Attribute maps of half energy are used to infer possible asymmetric changes in 

lithology or porosity (Figure 87). 

 

In this work, more attention was given to volume attributes in Petrel 2008.1 than to 

surface attributes. This is due to the high potential of visualization and application 

of the former. In fact, seismic attribute volumes are creating a new paradigm in 3D 

seismic interpretation.  

 

More attributes can be computed using Petrel’s tool “Seismic Calculation”. This 

tool allows not only to directly extract new information from seismic data but also 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

120 

allows combining available seismic attributes with each other, or to compute their 

derivatives in respect to time or space.

the horizon. Abrupt changes in the attribute value may indicate lithological changes.

Chapter V.   The Role of Seismic Attributes 

in 3D Seismic Interpretation: A Case 

Study Offshore West Africa  

 

In the previous chapter, a brief introduction was given to the standard seismic 

attributes available in Petrel 2008.1. In this chapter, seismic attributes are applied 

to the recognition and characterization of a potential area of hydrocarbon 

accumulation, from an area offshore W. Africa, where information from well log 

data is not available. 

 

The interpretation process was divided into two different stages, following the 

standard method of 3D seismic data interpretation applied by most oil and gas 

companies: (1) “Prospect Generation” - during this stage, a raw interpretation of 

the original seismic data is carried out, and volume attributes are computed to 

identify structures that may correspond to potential hydrocarbon reservoirs; this 

can be followed by geobody extraction for inclusion into reservoir geological 

models; (2) “Advanced Interpretation” – this corresponds to the interpretation of 

key seismic reflectors and derived surface attributes (or attribute maps) inside the 

target area(s) delineated in (1). A first approach to facies classification, based on 

an artificial neural network method, was also performed on the seismic data. 

 

V.1. Prospect Generation 

 

The “prospect generation” started with the interpretation of the seabed surface 

(Figure 2). The seabed was automatically tracked along the seismic cube, based 

on the interpretation of a coarse grid of inline/crosslines, constrained by a 

structural smoothing cube. This is particularly important for this study area 

because the seabed surface is intensely affected by the underlying salt bodies, 

preferentially orientated NNW-SSE, sinuous channel complexes roughly orientated 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

122 

E-W, and regional faults with NNE-SSW and NNW-SSE direction trends (Figure 

88). The orientation of the sinuous channels complexes is mainly constrained by 

the subcrop of the salt bodies. 

 

 

Figure 88 – Preliminary interpretation of the seabed at a regional scale. Red elipses represent 
elongated salt bodies. Arrows show the direction of the main channels and white dashed lines 
indicate the main trend of regional faults. 

 

A detailed analysis of the seabed surface is also useful to detect the potential 

presence of any gas related features.  

 

V.1.1. Identification of Gas Related Features 

 

A detailed interpretation of the sea bottom surface for the study area, combined 

with the interpretation of vertical seismic sections, allowed the identification of 

several alignments of round depressions, interpreted as pockmarks (Figure 89). 

Pockmarks are seafloor depressions caused by the escape of gas or fluids from 

the subsurface; escape paths usually exploit faults or zones of weakness (Evans, 

2003). Pockmarks are important structures because they reveal the presence of 

hydrocarbons at depth. Therefore, in the study area, the identification and 

interpretation of pockmarks at the seabed surface was used as a first approach to 



Chapter V The Role of Seismic Attributes in 3D Seismic Interpretation 

123 

evaluate its hydrocarbon potential. Following the gas escape path in depth, using 

vertical seismic sections, allows the interpretation of hydrocarbon accumulations. 

Aligned pockmarks reveal the presence of faults, which most of the times follow a 

regional trend. Buried pockmarks indicate ancient periods of gas escape, and 

were also identified in some vertical seismic sections (Figure 90). 

 

 

Figure 89 – Aligned pockmarks identified at the sea-bottom and followed at depth along vertical 
seismic sections. The relationship with the underlying fault that acted as the fluid conduit is evident. 

 

 

Figure 90 – Buried pockmarks below an active pockmark. Note the underlying bright reflection that 
represents either an old pockmark or a small gas accumulation related to the same escape 
pathway.

V.1.2. Analysis of Deep-Sea Channel Complexes 

 

Deep-sea channel complexes have seen their importance grow in the oil and gas 

exploration industry as proven hydrocarbon reservoirs. These depositional 

features are of particular interest offshore Angola, Brazil, Guinea, Gulf of Mexico 

and India (Kolla et al., 2007). Published seismic sections from deep-sea sinuous 

channel complexes (or channel-levee systems) often show high amplitude 

reflections from their erosional bases, which are flanked by low seismic amplitude 

overbank deposits (or levees; Kolla et al., 2007). In these depositional 

environments, low amplitudes can be correlated with shales and/or mudstones, 

while high amplitudes are lithology-indicative of sands (Evans, 2003). The 

availability of recent 3D seismic datasets with high horizontal and vertical 

resolution, which are easily handled by leading edge seismic interpretation 

software, combined with the advances in the exploration and production 

technology from submarine channels, allow a better understanding about the 

geometry, architecture, and the spatial/temporal distribution of deep-sea channel 

complexes (Posamentier, 2003; Wynn et al., 2007). 

 

In the last few decades highly sinuous channel complexes are understood as 

common depositional features of modern deep-sea fans. Deep-sea fans are thick 

sedimentary features associated with gravitationally driven mass movement 

deposits. These movements include turbidite deposits, mass movement debries 

and pelagic drapes (strata.geol.sc.edu). These sediments can be later reworked 

by bottom currents, creating in this way complex systems of sinuous channels 

(Kolla et al., 2007). The presence of stacked and amalgamated channels 

interpreted in the seismic dataset (Figure 91) suggest that the study area 

corresponds to the “upper fan” section of a deep-sea fan morphologic model 

(Figure 92; strata.geol.sc.edu). 

 

Channel-levee systems can be interpreted on vertical seismic sections by their 

large erosional bases associated with high amplitude reflections. Often, several 

cuts, also with high amplitude reflections, can be interpreted above the main 

erosional base. Each cut corresponds to a new position of the channel in time. 



Chapter V The Role of Seismic Attributes in 3D Seismic Interpretation 

125 

Channels can also migrate laterally or suffer vertical aggradation processes 

(Figure 91a; Figure 93).  

 

 

(a) 

 

 

 

(b) 

Figure 91 – (a) Typical vertical seismic section with interpreted stacked channels commonly found 
throughout the seismic cube under investigation. Around the 1000ms ancient channel complexes 
can also be identified, but it is very difficult to interpret each channel independently. (b) Schematic 
representation of the evolution of the channel along time (Kolla et al., 2007). The channels 
interpreted in (a) can be correlated with the geometries represented in (b). Both lateral migration 
and vertical aggradation are observed. 

 

The architecture and geometry of the submarine channels can be correlated to 

conceptual models which describe the relative position of the channel, the mode of 

the cuts and the fill with the temporal evolution (Figure 91b). 

 

Strong analogies between deep-water sinuous channel complexes and fluvial 

systems have been recently done in order to understand more about how deep-

water complexes work. In fact, there are many similarities between both systems; 

however, the analogy should be done carefully since there are substantial 

differences in the internal architecture and the mode of evolution of deep-water 

channel complexes (Kolla et al., 2007; Wynn et al., 2007).  Submarine channel 

normally have smoother bottoms with low angle overbanks and a highly vertical 

aggradation nature (Wynn et al., 2007). These differences are related to density 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

126 

contrasts of flows relative to ambient fluids, the effect of centrifugal and Coriolis
16

 

forces on flows, modes of sediment transport, and effects of sea level changes 

(Kolla et al., 2007).  

 

 

Figure 92 - Schematic representation of a deep-sea fan complex morphology. The interpretation of 
stacked and amalgamated sinuous channels shown in this Chapter, places the study area 
somewhere in the “upper fan” section of the deep-sea fan (from Christopher and Kendal (2006) in 
strata.geol.sc.edu).  

 

In the oil and gas exploration industry the recognition of a channel system in 

vertical seismic sections is important, but tracking it in space is the key factor to 

fully evaluate the depositional feature as a possible hydrocarbon reservoir. 

Unfortunately, using standard horizontal time slices along the seismic cube is not 

enough to carry a good interpretation of the channel complexes. Submarine 

                                            
16

 Coriolis force is an apparent deflection of the centrifugal force produced by the Earth. Due to this effect, 
moving particles in Earth’s surface suffer a displacement to the right in the northern hemisphere, and to the 
left in the southern. 



Chapter V The Role of Seismic Attributes in 3D Seismic Interpretation 

127 

channels are not perfectly horizontal because they follow the regional dip of the 

area; consequently, horizontal time slices are not generally parallel to the 

channels’ surface, originating misinterpretations or difficulties in the correlation 

between the vertical seismic sections and the time slices.  

 

 

Figure 93 - Example of a sinuous channel system with lateral continuous channel migration as well 
as some aggradation. The sinuous channel complex, and associated overbank deposits, are 
housed in a larger master valley, bounded by master overbanks. 

 

An example of a horizontal time slice extracted from the original amplitude seismic 

cube of the study area is shown in Figure 94. Here, high amplitudes do not define, 

on their own, channel-levee systems associated with deep-sea sinuous channel 

complexes. This happens because the horizontal slicing is not parallel to the dip of 

the channel complexes. In order to overcome this drawback there are three 

possible best practices: (1) to combine vertical and horizontal seismic intersections 

in a 3D view in order to follow a channel (see, for example Figure 95); this is an 

effective method if there is a channel which can be identified and isolated in 

horizontal time slices; (2) by using seismic attributes, in particular the ones that 

enhance edges (e.g. variance IV.3.3.5), to distinguish between different channel 

systems, isolate depositional features and correlate them with the original seismic 

(Figure 96);  (3) by using the strata slicing method described in Zeng (1998a; b), 

which is generally the best approach. 

 

In this work, considering its main objectives and due to time constraints, only the 

first and the second methods were used.

Figure 94 - Example of a time slice extracted from the original seismic cube. The identification of 
the sinuous channel complexes (one such system is highlighted inside the black box) is not 
immediate because the channels’ surfaces and the time slice are not parallel. 

 

A channel system can be observed in time slices along the original seismic volume 

(see Figure 94 and Figure 95). In order to enhance it for easier interpretation, 

seismic attributes (e.g. variance, gradient magnitude, chaos) were computed.

The variance seismic volume was the most useful attribute volume to use in the 

interpretation of this depositional system. Its interpretation, combined  with the 

original seismic data, allowed the definition of: (1) an area of several sinuous 

channel-levee complexes, which can be considered a “minor unit” of a submarine 

fan (Figure 96a; Wynn et al., 2007); (2) a well defined channel-levee system, 

elongated NNW-SSE, with potential to be a hydrocarbon reservoir; for this reason, 

most of the seismic attributes were tested at this site (henceforth, this target will be  

referred to as the target channel system; Figure 66b; Figure 96b).

complexes belts (inside the green lines). (b) close up to the target channel system, where an 
oxbow from a near channel complex can be identified. Note the much superior quality of the 
attribute map for interpretation, compared with the original seismic section (Figure 95). 

 

The interpretation of several time slices along the variance attribute cube allowed 

a preliminary characterization of the depositional elements that belong to the 

target channel system. This system comprises a well defined sinuous channel, 

with levees and cutoff loops (or oxbows), within a larger channel belt (Figure 96; 

Figure 97). The channel-levee system is seismically characterized by high 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

130 

amplitudes at the bottom, a low-amplitude fill and a thin bed with high amplitudes 

in the central part of the channel which may indicate a sand fill (Figure 98). 

 

The presence of loop cutoffs (Figure 96; Figure 97) highlights the dynamic nature 

of these systems and is evidence of turbidity flows with high erosive power 

(Posamentier, 2003). A detailed examination of meander loops illustrates both the 

swing and sweep effects. Swing is the lateral loop migration and/or expansion of 

the channel system; sweep is a down-system sinuous loop migration (Figure 99; 

Posamentier, 2003; Wynn et al., 2007).  

 

The levees associated with the target channel system have variable height and the 

same configuration as the ones from another channel system in the study area, 

illustrated in Figure 93. Levees are part of the so called master and secondary 

overbanks, and are often related to floodplains (term used in analogy with land 

fluvial systems).

the limit of the sinuous channel belt. At this “depth” (TWT) along this time slice, an incipient cutoff 
and several point-bar scrolls can be interpreted (compare also with Figure 66b). The inset in the 
upper right corner shows a fluvial meandering system; there is a clear analogy in the overall 
morphology of the two systems.

In addition, a depositional element interpreted as a crevasse splay was also 

identified. The interpretation was based on both the variance and the Iso-

Frequency (see Section IV.3.4.3) attributes. A crevasse splay is a depositional 

feature, associated with highly energetic turbidity currents, which often appears at 

sharp bends that break the outer levee leading to the development of an 

unconfined lobate or tongue-shaped deposit in the overbank area (Figure 100b; 

Posamentier, 2003). This depositional element was first identified in the study area 

on variance time slices (Figure 100a) as an isolate body that does not correspond 

to an ancient location of the channel system. Using the Iso-Frequency attribute 

and comparing different cosine frequencies (Figure 77a; b) it has been shown that 

the feature inside the green polygon is different from the lithology inside the target 

channel system (the correlation value is different for the same cosine frequency). 

This feature has been interpreted as a crevasse splay, based on its morphology, 

the interpretation of indicative-lithology seismic attributes, the interpretation of the 

surrounding environment and the analogy with modern fluvial systems.

interpreted as a crevasse splay, combining variance with Iso-Frequency attribute. (b) Is an aerial 
photo of a crevasse slay in a fluvial system. 

 

Edge detection attributes such as variance and gradient magnitude can also be 

extremely useful to understand the behavior of sinuous channels that cannot be 

tracked on time slices from the original seismic cube. In particular, the 

interpretation of channel complexes in vertical seismic sections is often very 



Chapter V The Role of Seismic Attributes in 3D Seismic Interpretation 

133 

difficult and ambiguous. The example below shows a vertical seismic section 

where three channels can be identified (Figure 101a), based on their morphology 

and character. However, a combined display of the vertical seismic section with a 

variance time slice (which, as discussed above, is good for highlighting features 

such as these) allows unraveling the fact that, instead of three separate channels, 

we are dealing with just one channel which is meandering in the direction 

perpendicular to the vertical seismic section (Figure 101b).

(b) 

Figure 101 – (a) Seismic inline where high amplitude and erosive seismic reflectors are interpreted 
as individual channels bottom. (b) The combined interpretation of the same seismic line with a 
variance time slice highlights the channel system, in high resolution, and allows the correct 
interpretation of a single meandering channel. 

 

Fully understanding the depositional systems associated with deep-sea channel 

complexes is still a recent branch in 3D seismic interpretation. 3D seismic datasets 

allow nevertheless a much better knowledge about these systems. The 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

134 

introduction of seismic volume attributes to enhance depositional elements, in 

particular stratigraphic and structural attributes, has brought a new reality to the 

interpretation of deep-sea channel complexes. Combined visualizations in three-

dimensions, for example (Figure 102), allow the recognition and correlation of 

seismic patterns with depositional features interpreted from seismic intersections 

of the volume attribute. Tracking 3D depositional events in space using seismic 

attributes is now a much easier task and contributes to a better understanding of 

the architectural relationship of the various depositional elements and their 

position and evolution in time. 

 

 

Figure 102 - Variance attribute along a time slice, combined with the original seismic data. This 
type of display allows the correlation between seismic patterns and depositional events and makes 
tracking depositional elements much easier. 

 

V.1.3. Salt Tectonics 

 

Salt tectonics played a very important role in the structural development of the 

marginal sedimentary basins off West Africa. In fact, this process allowed the 



Chapter V The Role of Seismic Attributes in 3D Seismic Interpretation 

135 

creation of many structural oil traps which are nowadays major hydrocarbon plays 

within the study area. 

 

The salt is an evaporite with unique properties and behavior: it is uncompressible, 

it has low density (~2.2g/c
3
), a high seismic velocity, a high level of plasticity and 

zero porosity. Therefore, it is impermeable and can act as a seal.  

 

When compared to other sediments, the salt has higher densities until 

approximately the 1000m depth (Figure 103). Since the salt is uncompressible its 

density remains the same with the increase in depth; on the other hand, 

sediments, which are compressible, become denser than salt with the increase in 

depth (Figure 103). 

 

 

Figure 103 - Diagram of salt’s density vs. depth. At approximately 1000m the salt starts to be less 
dense than the sediments surrounding (modified from Dobrin and Savit, 1988). 

 

The salt is deposited in layers with constant thickness, but due to its mechanical 

properties and the weight of the sediments above, it moves upwards creating 

intrusive bodies with different shapes and configurations. Traditional shapes of salt 

bodies are: diapirs, salt domes, salt walls, massif salt, allochthonous salt, salt 

pillows, and salt canopies (Figure 104; Figure 108). 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

136 

 

Figure 104 - Different salt bodies morphology (modified from Trusheim, 1960). 

 

Buoyancy and differential compaction are the two main processes which trigger 

the salt movement to produce the salt bodies previously mentioned. The buoyancy 

phenomenon acts due to the weight of denser sediments above the salt layer. The 

salt moves laterally to an area of weakness of the overlying bed, creating a 

thinning below the denser sediments (Figure 105).  

 

 

Figure 105 – Buoyancy phenomenon (modified from Garcia, 2008). 

 

The differential compaction occurs by two reasons: (1) when there are sediments 

with variable densities above a salt layer (Figure 106); (2) when there is a local 

difference of sediment volumes above the salt layer. The lateral variations of 

density, or volumes, cause a thinning of the salt layer below the denser sediments. 

These density differences are translated in a movement of the salt to areas with 

lower densities, creating a rising in the sedimentary layer above.

(b)

Chapter V The Role of Seismic Attributes in 3D Seismic Interpretation 

137 

Salt tectonics was a key process in the configuration of the sedimentary basins off 

West Central Africa. The movement of the salt to upper stratigraphic levels 

changed the configuration of sedimentary sequences allowing the creation of 

hydrocarbon traps (Figure 107).  

 

 

Figure 107 - Common types of hydrocarbon traps associated with the movement of salt bodies 
(from www.geo.wvu.edu). 

 

In seismic data with original amplitudes, salt bodies exhibit a chaotic texture and 

are generally easily identified (Figure 108). However, in order to be able to isolate 

and enhance the salt bodies, high resolution variance (see Section IV.3.3.5; Figure 

96) and instantaneous frequency (see Section IV.3.2.5; Figure 58) attributes 

should be used, as shown earlier in this Chapter.

salt dome.

V.1.4. Structural Control in the Study Area 

 

A preliminary characterization of the principal types of faulting in the study area 

was performed, by identifying faults in the original seismic cube, and also using 

automatic detection algorithms, such as Ant Tracking (see Section IV.3.3.6) on the 

variance (see Section IV.3.3.5) cubes. 

 

The main trends of the principal regional faults were interpreted both by their 

expression on the seafloor morphology and by the alignments directions of 

pockmarks and salt bodies (Figure 88). The interpreted regional faulting trend is 

mainly NNE- SSW and NNW-SSE. The two principal types of faults identified in 

the study area are: (1) steep normal and strike-slip faults; (2) small faults with a 

radial geometry immediately above the salt bodies. 

 

(1) The steep faults are characterized by their extension from deep in the section 

to the seafloor, and normally follow the two main faulting direction trends 

mentioned above (Figure 109). At several locations, these faults act as conduits 

for the salt intrusions, as described in Section V.1.3. 

 

 

Figure 109 - Vertical seismic section showing a regional steep fault with expression at the seabed 
(see inset at the lower left corner). The salt body probably moved along the fault in depth. 



Chapter V The Role of Seismic Attributes in 3D Seismic Interpretation 

139 

 Interpreting these faults at “depth” (TWT) is also important since oil migration 

paths from the sub-salt to above the salt can also be identified. Most of the proven 

active petroleum systems in the study area have their source rock below the salt 

layer and high quality reservoirs in the upper stratigraphic sequences. 

 

(2) Small faults with radial geometry (Figure 110) can be interpreted as faults 

associated with the intrusion of salt in the layers above. 

 

 

Figure 110 - Small faults created by the salt intrusion. 

 

A detailed interpretation of the different faults system, both at large and small 

scales, along the target area should always be performed in order to identify 

possible reservoir areas. Conjugate faults with the right geometry, can act as 

structural hydrocarbon traps due to the closure of high porous lithologies against 

faults which do not allow fluid circulation along them. Fault closure is often 

observed in vertical seismic sections by abrupt termination of bright reflections 

against interpreted faults (Figure 111). Seismic attributes can be useful in the fault 

interpretation and characterization processes.

giving the needed closure to trap the hydrocarbons (Schlumberger, personal communication). 

 

V.1.5. Geobody Extraction 

 

Geobody Extraction is a leading edge utility, in Petrel, that allows extracting 

visually and interactively features of interest from the seismic data. Each feature is 

isolated blending several seismic volumes with user-defined settings. The isolated 

seismic feature is then extracted into a discrete object, the geobody itself, by a 

simple mouse click using the method “what you see is what you pick”. The 

geobody can then be used for different purposes: essentially, it can be sampled 

into a geological model grid to be populated with properties (e.g. porosity, 

permeability), or its boundaries or middle surfaces converted in horizon 

interpretation points. These interpretation points can be used to help the traditional 

interpretation process or can be inserted into a hydrocarbon model after being 

converted into surfaces. Channels and salt domes are typical features which have 

proven results in geobody extractions. The “Geobody Extraction” process, in 

Petrel, can be found under Geophysics (Schlumberger, personal communication). 

 

The first step of the extraction process is the introduction of a probe. A probe can 

be defined as a cropped rendering of one or more blended seismic volumes, in 

which the seismic feature will become isolated. Seismic volumes used to create 

the probe should allow the isolation of the feature through a contrast in colours 



Chapter V The Role of Seismic Attributes in 3D Seismic Interpretation 

141 

between the target feature and the background data; the isolation is achieved 

using the opacity curve of each seismic cube. The probe should also have enough 

size to cover the area of the feature to be extracted. Since the geobody extraction 

process is a very intensive process, it is suggested to draw a polygon around the 

seismic feature and clip the probe outside it. This last step will reduce the 

rendered probe volume, increasing the speed of visualization and manipulation.  

 

Features are isolated by accessing the “Opacity Tab” in the probe settings. This 

tab shows the colour scale bar and a histogram of colours amplitudes for each 

seismic volume that were used to create the probe (Figure 112). 

 

 

(a) 

 

(b) 

Figure 112 – Example of two probes’ “Opacity Tab”, used in the "Extract Geobody" process, to 
extract: (a) a channel using a variance cube. Values of variance meaning discontinuities have been 
removed from the display (grey area); and (b) a salt body, using a blend of variance and 
instantaneous frequency cubes. Only a small interval of instantaneous frequency values is typical 
of a salt body signature, the rest of the values are not displayed in the probe (grey area). As a 
complement to isolate the salt body, the values of variance meaning continuity were hidden (grey 
area). 

 

Colour intervals which are not part of the desired feature can be filtered and 

removed from the probe visualization, interactively, by turning their correspondent 

areas into grey, inside the histogram display. Grey areas are not displayed in the 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

142 

probe visualization, isolating the feature to be extracted from the background data 

(Figure 113; Figure 114). 

 

To extract the isolated feature into a geobody, Petrel’s “Extract Geobody” function 

needs to be activated. Then, the interpreter just needs to click on the isolated 

feature. The geobody will be automatically created and converted into a discrete 

object based on a user-defined threshold opacity value. If a cell has an opacity 

value below the user-defined threshold value, the area will not be sampled into the 

object; on the other hand, if the cell has an opacity value above the threshold, it 

will be inserted into the geobody.  

 

 

Figure 113 - Isolated target channel system using a variance probe and the opacity curve shown in 
the Figure 112a. The probe is now ready to the “extract geobody” process, since it is isolated from 
the background. Figure 115, in blue, shows the extracted channel system as a geobody. 

 



Chapter V The Role of Seismic Attributes in 3D Seismic Interpretation 

143 

 

Figure 114 - Isolated salt dome using a blend of instantaneous frequency and variance probes. 
The opacity curve for each attribute is shown in Figure 112b. The geobody representing this salt 
dome is shown on Figure 115, in light green. 

 

Two geological features have been extracted as a geobody in the scope of this 

work: the turbidite target channel system; and a nearby salt dome. The channel 

was isolated using a probe representative of the variance attribute, where values 

related to discontinuities were hidden, using the “Opacity Tab” shown in Figure 

112a. The variance attribute is the adequate choice to isolate channels since 

normally, inside the channel, there are many continuous reflectors with values of 

variance close to 0. On the other hand, the border of the channel often appears as 

discontinuities in the variance attribute, with values of variance equal to 1 (Figure 

113). This contrast in continuity allows a perfect isolation and extraction of the 

channel as a geobody (Figure 115). 

 

The salt dome was extracted using two attribute volumes at the same time: the 

instantaneous frequency and the variance cubes. These two attributes were 

chosen because the former is good to fill the inside of the salt body (salt bodies 

show low instantaneous frequency values), while the variance attribute enhances 

its boundaries. With the adjusted opacity curve for both attributes (Figure 112b) 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

144 

the visual isolation of the salt dome became very good (Figure 114). The extracted 

geobody from the salt dome is shown on Figure 115 (in green).

time slice of the variance cube. The variance time slice can be used to compare the level of detail 
that can be achieved using Petrel’s “extract geobody” process.  

 

V.2. Advanced Interpretation and Facies Classification 

 

Generally, at the advanced interpretation stage the main objective is the 

characterization of potential geological features, identified in the prospect 

generation stage, which may act as hydrocarbon reservoirs. The target channel 

system, identified in Section V.1.2, is a potential stratigraphic hydrocarbon 

reservoir, and consequently was used here as a testing area for advanced 

interpretation. 

 

At this stage, the standard procedure of an oil and gas company is the 

interpretation of the key seismic reflectors that define the potential hydrocarbon 

reservoirs, and the analysis of attribute maps using surfaces provided by the 

advanced interpretation process. 



Chapter V The Role of Seismic Attributes in 3D Seismic Interpretation 

145 

V.2.1. Surface Attributes Interpretation 

 

In this work, an interpretation of the upper and lower boundaries of the target 

channel system (Figure 116) was attempted, using a manual interpretation picking, 

guided by the interpretation points provided by the extracted geobody (see Section 

V.1.5.). A middle horizon, within the manually interpreted upper and lower 

boundaries of the target, was interpreted by automatically converting the middle 

surface of the geobody into interpretation points. 

 

 

Figure 116 - Interpretation of the upper (in green) and lower (in orange) boudaries of the target 
channel system in a vertical seismic section. 

 

The interpretation of the boundary surfaces of the target channel system was 

divided in two phases: (1) the manual interpretation of closely spaced 

inlines/crosslines, in order to create a tight interpretation (Figure 117a); (2) the 

spatial extrapolation of the interpretation grid picks, applying the Petrel’s “3D 

Autotracking” function constrained by a structural smoothed cube (see Section 

IV.3.3.4; Figure 117b). Using a seismic cube with reduced spatial noise and 

enhanced seismic reflectors continuity to extrapolate a dense interpretation grid, 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

146 

was the best approach to create reliable surfaces on such a complex sinuous 

channel system. 

 

 

(a) 

 

(b)

Petrel’s “3D Autotracking” function in (a) to extend spatially the interpretation. A polygon around the 
channel was used to constrain the autotracked interpretation.  

 

In order to characterize the target area, the interpretation of attribute maps is 

necessary. Attribute maps, or surface attributes in Petrel, are extracted from 



Chapter V The Role of Seismic Attributes in 3D Seismic Interpretation 

147 

surfaces and not from interpretation points (Petrel’s “Make Surface” process, 

found under Utilities, allows the conversion of the interpretations points into 

surfaces).  

 

Several surface attributes, with different parameters were extracted from the 

interpreted surfaces of the target channel system. RMS amplitude and Iso-

Frequency (using different cosine frequencies) were the most promising attributes, 

using a search window of 100ms below the upper boundary surface. 

 

The RMS amplitude (see Section IV.3.1.8) attribute was the first surface attribute 

generated since it can easily detect porous lithologies, which normally have the 

potential to form high quality hydrocarbon reservoirs. The generated attribute map 

(Figure 118) shows a well defined area of high RMS amplitude values inside the 

target channel area (Figure 118, inside the white circle). This area is interpreted as 

corresponding to high porosity lithologies (sand-like). This RMS amplitude 

anomaly become more interesting since it is consistent in depth using different 

search windows lengths (e.g. in Figure 86, the same anomaly was also observed 

in a surface attribute extracted with a shorter window length). 

 

 

Figure 118 - RMS amplitude extracted below the top surface with a search window of 100ms. A 
small area with high RMS amplitude values, inside the with circle, can be indentified.  This high 
values are probaly related to porous sands, and may indicate a potential hydrocarbon reservoir. 
High vaules in the flank of the channel are artifacts induced by the horizon picking. 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

148 

High RMS amplitude values in such a small area can be indicative of a potential 

site for hydrocarbon accumulation. To test this assumption, Iso-Frequency 

attribute maps were computed. 

 

Surface attributes with different Iso-Frequencies (Section IV.3.4.3) were extracted 

from the upper boundary surface. The interpretation of these attribute maps was 

complemented with the information given by the RMS amplitude attribute maps, 

already discussed above.  The interpretation of the attribute map shown in Figure 

119, extracted with a cosine frequency of 25Hz, allows a much better delineation 

of the same area already identified in RMS amplitude surface attributes. The area 

of interest, when compared to the surrounding areas, shows a constant value of 

Iso-Frequency allowing a better spatial delineation of the interpreted high porosity 

area. 

 

 

Figure 119 – Iso-Frequency surface attribute extracted with a cosine frequency of 25Hz, 100ms 
below the upper surface of the target channel system. It is possible to interpret an area of interest 
(inside the green circle) with different lithology when compared to other areas inside the channel 
system. Compare with Figure 118. 

 

Due to time limitations, other surface attributes were not extracted in the scope of 

this work and the characterization of the area of interest was complemented, using 

horizontal time slices from several volume attributes. Although, as previously 

discussed, the target channel system is not parallel to horizontal time slices, if only 



Chapter V The Role of Seismic Attributes in 3D Seismic Interpretation 

149 

a small area inside the channel system is considered, a horizontal time slice 

extracted at the same two-way-time of the target area is a good approximation.  

  

V.2.2. Facies Classification Cube 

 

At the end of the interpretation process, a facies classification cube was computed 

using an unsupervised artificial neural network (see Section V.2.2), using seismic 

attributes volumes as training data. This artificial neural network facies 

classification was computed with the objective of mapping lithological variations 

inside the target channel.  

 

Four attribute cubes, two Iso-Frequency (see Section IV.3.4.3) volumes, with 

frequencies at 30 and 35Hz, one envelope (see Section IV.3.2.2), and one 

variance (see Section IV.3.3.5) cube, were used as input to train the estimation 

model of the neural network.  

 

These attributes were found to be the best input to train the neural network, in 

Petrel 2008.1, because each of these attributes enhances different features in the 

seismic data, but in all of them, the output attribute volume is lithologically 

dependent. In addition, they all showed a good behavior in the (1) correlation and 

(2) in the principal component analysis. 

  

(1) The correlation table computed between the chosen attributes (Figure 83) does 

not follow the requirements described in Section IV.3.4.5. There are high 

correlation values between the 30Hz and 35Hz Iso-Frequency volumes (red cells), 

and low correlation values between the variance and the envelope attributes (blue 

cells). However, the correlation rules should not be followed blindly, and seismic 

attributes should also be selected by their potential output information, if they are 

suitable for the original dataset and what answers the user requires from the 

neural network process. In this case, in spite of the high correlations observed 

between the two Iso-Frequency cubes, they have proven, nonetheless useful to 

infer variations in lithology and therefore both were used. The variance cube was 

used since it enhances discontinuities and the main objective of computing the 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

150 

facies cube was the delineation of the target channel system and its lithological 

variations. The variance cube also shows good correlation values with the Iso-

Frequency cubes. The envelope cube has good correlation values with all the 

other attributes and, since it is an attribute related to the energy content of the 

data, it is useful to distinguish lithological variations. From a general point of view, 

the correlation table shows acceptable values between the selected attributes to 

train the neural network (Figure 83). 

  

(2) The principal component analysis (PCA; Figure 120) allowed reducing the 

dimensionality of the input vectors, due to the low value of the Eigenvalue relative 

to the principal component PC4. As a result, only the three first PCs were used, 

accelerating the classification process and reducing the uncertainty associated 

with the neural network process.  

 

 

Figure 120 - Principal component analysis table used to select the input to train the neural 
network. 

 

Petrel’s unsupervised neural networks allow grouping the information provided by 

the several inputs in a user-defined number of classes. In this case, 4 classes 

were used as a starting point. The Competitive Learning Algorithm in the “train 

estimation model” ran until the 100
th
 interaction and the input data was placed in 

the most probable class every time the probabilistic value was greater than 0.10.  

 

The output facies volume, computed in this way, shows each user-defined class 

with a different colour, that can ideally be assigned to different lithologies (Figure 

121). From the combined interpretation of the facies classification cube, the 

original seismic data, and the seismic attributes used to train the estimation model, 

a preliminary correspondence between the class, the original seismic texture and 



Chapter V The Role of Seismic Attributes in 3D Seismic Interpretation 

151 

the lithology is proposed: Class 1, in purple, was interpreted as corresponding to 

high amplitudes in the original seismic data and can be related to high porosity 

lithologies, such as sands; Class 2, in yellow, was interpreted as corresponding to 

chaotic patterns in the seismic data such as those associated with salt bodies; 

Class 3, in orange, was interpreted as corresponding to low amplitude seismic 

reflectors, which may indicate the presence of mudstones or shales; Class 4, in 

grey, was interpreted as corresponding to discontinuities, such as borders of salt 

bodies, channels and channels systems. 

 

From the interpretation of horizontal time slices along the facies classification cube 

following the target channel system (Figure 122) it was possible to interpret lateral 

changes in lithology inside the turbidite channel and to define an area of interest. 

This area was already identified in many seismic attributes, particularly surface 

attributes (see Section IV.4) and, following the correspondence between class and 

lithology, it was interpreted as high porosity sands. 

 

 

Figure 121 – Facies classification cube computed using an artificial neural network. As training 
data two Iso-Frequency cubes with 30 and 35Hz, an envelope and a variance cube were used. In 
this horizontal section a salt dome and several channel complexes including the target channel 
system can be distinguished. 

 

This facies classification cube presented here is considered a first approach to 

infer about the subsurface lithology in the survey area. However, unsupervised

neural networks have limitations since there are no real parameters to constrain 

the model and therefore the results should be interpreted with caution. When well 

log data is available well constrained results can be achieved since the output of 

the neural network is constantly compared with the real data in order to achieve a 

convergence between the estimated facies and the well log data, resulting a more 

reliable model.   

 

 

Figure 122 - Time slice from the facies classification volume.  Based on the interpretation of each 
class it may be inferred that the area of interest in the central part of the target channel systems (in 
purple) is possibly related with highly porous sands and therefore a potential hydrocarbon 
reservoir. 

 

V.2.3. Preliminary Characterization of a Hydrocarbon 

Reservoir 

 

The delineated area, inside the target channel system, was identified from the 

interpretation of the surface attributes (Section V.2.1), and it was characterized 

using a combination of several seismic attributes. 

 

Structural attributes, with a highlight for the variance cube, showed and allowed 

the identification and morphological characterization of the turbidite channel

system. From the geological background of the study area, turbidite channels are 

often proven and high quality hydrocarbon reservoirs. Consequently, further 

interpretation, based on other seismic attributes, was also carried out to delineate 

the area with more potential to contain hydrocarbon accumulations and therefore 

with more likelihood to be a hydrocarbon reservoir. 

 

A potential hydrocarbon area was identified inside the target channel system 

(Figure 123). This area was identified by its response to well known seismic 

attributes which are indicative of the presence of hydrocarbon accumulations: (1) 

high values of original amplitudes (Figure 98) were the first clue; (2) the envelope 

attribute showed a limited area with high values (Figure 123), which are often 

indicative of porous lithologies, such as sands; (3) the instantaneous frequency 

attribute was interpreted in time slices immediately below the time slices where the 

envelope attribute was interpreted and it showed, for the same area of high values 

of envelope, low frequency values, when compared to the rest of the channel 

(Figure 123); this is a common signature of sands filled with gas; (4) the RMS 

amplitude attribute map (Figure 118) showed the same behavior of the envelope 

time slice, reinforcing the interpretation idea of a hydrocarbon area; (5) finally, the 

Iso-Frequency attribute, together with the Relative Acoustic Impedance, allows a 

better correlation of these hydrocarbon evidences with the spatial facies 

distribution (Figure 119; Figure 124).  

 

The faulting pattern is another important factor to characterize a hydrocarbon 

reservoir. For this case, the Ant Tracking cube did not show any major faulting 

along this potential hydrocarbon reservoir. 

 

In conclusion, a careful interpretation of the extracted seismic attributes, available 

in Petrel 2008.1, over the study area allowed: (1) the identification of the 

depositional systems in the study area and the consequent identification and 

characterization of stacked turbidite channel systems which can be potential high 

quality hydrocarbon reservoirs; (2) the recognition of what may be a hydrocarbon 

reservoir inside the target channel system, by its response to energy, frequency 

and spectral decomposition attributes; (3) the confirmation that the target section 

of the turbidite channel is possibly filled with sands, in contrast to the rest of the

Chapter VI. Conclusions 

 

Seismic attributes can nowadays generally be calculated in most of the modern 

interpretation workstations and they are powerful tools to help the seismic 

interpretation process. Attributes derived from seismic data try to mimic the 

interpreter’s expertise, displaying the seismic data, which is normally plotted in 

amplitudes, from a new point of view. Interpreting the seismic data together with 

extracted seismic attributes often results in new insights into the data and the 

discovery of relationships between seismic events which are not always evident. 

 

The proliferation of high quality 3D seismic data, associated with huge 

developments in seismic interpretation software, made seismic attributes reliable 

solutions to solve ambiguous situations in the seismic interpretation process. 

However, attributes derived from seismic data cannot be applied as a general 

recipe, even if there are many examples in the literature that try to correlate the 

attributes with the expected results. These correlations should be done with 

especial care, since the output volume attribute, depending on the geological 

background of the dataset, may produce unexpected results. As a best practice to 

avoid misinterpretations, the interpreter needs to first identify the feature of interest 

before interpreting seismic attributes, and should always refer to the original data 

during the attribute guided interpretation. 

 

Seismic attributes are however extremely useful tools in the identification and 

characterization of hydrocarbon reservoirs since they are either directly sensitive 

to a reservoir property of interest or allow the user to interpret the structural and 

depositional systems of the study area far more easily. Identifying potential 

features which may act as hydrocarbon traps is the first step for a successful oil 

and gas exploration.  

 

In the scope of this work, the Petrel “seismic-to-simulation” software was used to 

generate and interpret the studied seismic attributes. This software has an 

extensive list of seismic attributes to help the seismic interpretation process. In 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

158 

Petrel, seismic attributes are first classified into volume and surface attributes (the 

equivalent to attribute maps), and then divided into different libraries according to 

the expected output extraction algorithm. Petrel’s seismic attributes which have 

the most potential are: all those belonging to the Seismic Signal Processing 

Library (see Section IV.3.1); envelope (see Section IV.3.2.2); instantaneous 

frequency (see SectionIV.3.2.5); variance (see Section IV.3.3.5); structural 

smoothing (see Section IV.3.3.4); local structural azimuth and dip (see Section 

IV.3.3.2); Ant Tracking (see Section IV.3.3.6); chaos (see Section IV.3.4.1); Iso-

Frequency (see Section IV.3.4.3) and relative acoustic impedance (see Section 

IV.3.4.4).  

 

Briefly, the seismic attributes listed above, when properly applied to seismic data 

can significantly increase the signal-to-noise ratio, resolve areas with low 

resolution, detect subtle lithological variations, enhance seismic reflectors’ 

continuity (by increasing the interpretation picking stability with automatic 

algorithms), help the structural interpretation (by automatically enhancing edges), 

enhance depositional features and train artificial neural networks to estimate facies 

distribution, including reservoir properties prediction between wells, and compute a 

facies classification cube with new information that can help to better understand 

the geology of the study area. Some attributes are also direct hydrocarbon 

indicators (DHIs). A summary of the most used seismic attributes, in Petrel, with 

their description and applicability is given in Table II. 

 

The interpretation of the dataset investigated in this work (see section Chapter V), 

and the study of the derived seismic attributes, allowed the identification of areas 

with pockmarks and the delineation in detail of salt intrusions and faults. In 

addition, a turbidite channel system with an area which may be a hydrocarbon 

reservoir (Figure 125) was also identified and interpreted. The variance attribute 

was successfully used for the characterization and identification of the depositional 

systems in the study area. Energy and frequency attributes (e.g. RMS amplitude, 

Iso-Frequency, Relative Acoustic Impedance) allowed the identification and 

characterization of the potential hydrocarbon reservoir. 

 

 



Chapter VI Conclusions  

159 

Table II – Summary of the most promising seismic attributes available in Petrel 2008.1 

Attribute Name Description Applicability 

RMS Amplitude 
The “root mean square” of the original amplitude within a user-
defined window (Section IV.3.1.8). 

Distinguish between lithological changes. High values of RMS Amplitude may 
indicate porous sands or sinuous channel belts. Isolated extreme values of this 
attribute may be a bright spot.  

Apparent Polarity 
The sign of f(t) at a local maximum of the Envelope attribute 
(Section IV.3.2.1). 

Useful to track lateral changes in lithology and enhance reflectors continuity. May 
distinguish different kinds of bright spots.  

Instantaneous 
Phase 

Is defined as the argument of the complex seismic trace (Section 
IV.3.2.3). 

Enhance reflectors continuity, discontinuities, faults and pinch-outs. Is useful in 
stratigraphic pattern interpretation. Can be used as a DHI. 

Cosine of 
Instantaneous 

Phase 

Is the cosine of the instantaneous phase attribute (Section 
IV.3.2.4) 

Improves reflectors continuity and enhance discontinuities, faults and pinch-outs. 
Helps the stratigraphic interpretation process. Since it is invariant with amplitude 
is used conjugated with the instantaneous phase attribute. 

Envelope 
Is the modulus, or the total instantaneous energy, of the complex 
seismic trace (Section IV.3.2.2). 

Distinguishes stratigraphic, lithologic, and fluid lateral variations inside a 
hydrocarbon reservoir; and major changes of lithology and sequency boundaries. 
It Can also be used as a DHI, it may identify bright spots.  

Instantaneous 
Frequency 

Is the rate of change in time of instantaneous phase attribute. 

Typically used to interpret lateral and vertical changes in lithology and identify 
faults by absorption effects. Can also be used as a DHI, since the presence of 
gas often causes what so called low-frequency shadow, below the hydrocarbon 
reservoir. 

Local Structural 
Azimuth and Dip 

Uses three methods to estimate the orientation of a bed. The 
gradient method calculates the gradient in 3 directions. The event 
uses the same approximation of the gradient method but with a 
different convention. The principal component method uses a 
principal component analysis to estimate the orientation 

Estimates the orientation, azimuth and dip, of a seismic reflector. It is also used 
as an internal algorithm for other seismic attributes extraction in Petrel. 

Structural 
Smoothing 

Fast volumetric signal processing. Apply a 3D Gaussian filter 
honoring, or not, the estimated bed orientation. 

Reduces spatial noise within the data, improving reflectors continuity. May also 
enhance edges. 

Variance 
It computes the normalized population variance with an optional 
weighted vertical smoothing. 

Detect edges, such as faults and discontinuities. It sharply delineates a salt body 
and with a short vertical window, variance attribute can be used to interpret 
depositional elements. 

Ant Tracking 
Uses swarm intelligent concepts where virtual “ants” are deployed 
into an edge detection cube (e.g. variance) to automatically track 
and enhance faults and discontinuities with high level of detail. 

The enhanced faults can be automatically extracted, using Petrel’s “Automatic 
Fault Extraction”, to be inserted in a hydrocarbon reservoir model. 

Chaos 
Measures how consistent is the orientation of a reflector estimated 
based on local structural azimuth attribute. 

Enhances edges, salt bodies and chaotic patterns within the original seismic data. 

Iso-Frequency 
Is a spectral decomposition method which uses a correlation 
between a user-defined cosine frequency and autocorrelation 
function of the original seismic data. 

May indicate subtle lithologic features which are not detected in original 
amplitude. Can also be used to interpret depositional elements. 

Relative Acoustic 
Impedance 

It tries to estimate the natural acoustic impedance log by 
integrating the original seismic trace and filtering it through a 
Butterworth filter. 

High values of relative acoustic impedance are often related with unconformity 
surface, sequence boundaries and discontinuities. It may also be used to detect 
the presence of fluids within the data. 



Seismic Attributes in the Characterization of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs 

160 

This interpreted potential hydrocarbon reservoir needs to be investigated in more 

detail to improve the odds of a successful exploratory drill. Horizons between the 

upper and lower boundaries need to be consistently picked and several attribute 

maps should be extracted and interpreted to achieve a better reservoir 

characterization and delineation. 

 

Future work should include the development of multi-attribute analysis for the 

automatic prediction and correlation of seismic textures with reliable facies 

distribution models. Automatic faults and fractures enhancement and detection is 

another important aspect in which seismic attributes workflows can have high 

importance and could be further developed. Further studies should also be done in 

order to tie attributes with well log data, if available, which will enable better 

correlations between the attributes and the petrophysical properties of a 

hydrocarbon reservoir.  

 

Lastly, the four months internship at Schlumberger allowed the author to become 

familiar with the daily routine of an employee in a support team from a service 

company for the oil and gas industry. It also allowed him to complement his 

academic background with new concepts related to seismic data processing, 

seismic attributes and seismic interpretation in the characterization and 

identification of potential hydrocarbon reservoirs.
