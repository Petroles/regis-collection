Abstract  

 

Biodiesel is an alternative fuel diesel that can be produced from vegetable oils and animal 

fats. There is a recent growing interest in the development of alternative technologies to the 

oil economy, based on renewable energy sources. A possible solution is a biofuel usable in 

compression-ignition engines, produced from biomass rich in fats and oils. A wide range of 

raw materials can be used in the production of biodiesel. Nevertheless, the use of sources that 

do not compete with the food market like waste cooking oils, which usually feature high 

levels of free fatty acids (FFA’s), can put problems in the process of production of biodiesel 

through alkaline transesterification. These problems are partially overcome by the use of 

catalysts, such as ionic liquids (IL’s) that also promote reactions of esterification of FFA’s to 

biodiesel. Thus, the objective of this work consists in the study of the influence of IL's 

application in the catalysis of: esterification reactions of organic acids to the corresponding 

methyl esters. 

In the first part of the work the influence, as catalysts, of several ionic liquids in the 

esterification reaction of oleic acid was analyzed. The experimental conditions were as 

follows: reaction time 6 hours, oleic acid / methanol molar ratio = 1/10 and temperature 90 ° 

C. The ionic liquids evaluated were as follows: 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen 

sulfate ([BMIM][HSO4]), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium methanesulfonate 

([BMIM][CH3SO3]), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium methylsulfate ([BMIM][CH3SO4]), 1-

metylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate ([MIM][HSO4]) and tributylmethylammonium 

methylsulfate. The values obtained for the conversion of the oleic acid esterification reaction 

showed that the ionic liquid [BMIM] [HSO4] would be one of the most promising catalysts.  

In a second part of the work, the recovery of LI [BMIM] [HSO4] was studied and several 

esterification reactions of oleic acid were carried out using a quantity of catalyst of 10 wt%, 

15 wt% and 20 wt% relative to the mass of oleic acid. The experimental conditions were as 

follows: reaction time 6 hours, oleic acid / methanol molar ratio = 1/10 and temperature 90 ° 

C. The reaction yield was found to be 76.6% to 10% IL, 83.3% to 15% IL and 84.8% to 20% 

IL. These yields decreased to 58.2% (10% IL) with 4 cycles of recycling, 75.2% (15% IL) 

with 5 cycles of recycling and 77.1% (20% IL) with 5 cycles of recycling. The results 

obtained confirm that it is possible to reuse this IL in successive reactions of esterification 

without great loss of yield and with this to significantly reduce the costs associated with the 

purchase of these compounds that are quite expensive.

Resumo 
 

O biodiesel é um combustível alternativo que pode ser produzido a partir de óleos vegetais e 

de gorduras animais. Atualmente existe um crescente interesse no desenvolvimento de 

tecnologias alternativas à economia do petróleo baseadas em fontes de energia renováveis. 

Uma possível solução é a utilização de um biocombustível em motores de compressão-

ignição, produzido a partir de biomassa rica em óleos e gorduras. Para a produção de 

biodiesel pode ser usada uma ampla gama de matérias-primas. No entanto, o uso de fontes 

que não competem com o mercado alimentar, como por exemplo os óleos alimentares usados, 

que geralmente têm um elevado nível de ácidos gordos livres (AGL´s), pode trazer problemas 

ao processo de produção de biodiesel através da transesterificação alcalina. Estes problemas 

são parcialmente ultrapassados usando catalisadores, tais como os líquidos iónicos (LI´s), que 

também promovem as reações de esterificação dos AGL´s a biodiesel. 

Assim, o objetivo desta dissertação de mestrado consistiu no estudo da aplicação de líquidos 

iónicos como catalisadores nas reações de esterificação de ácidos orgânicos aos 

correspondentes ésteres metílicos. 

Na primeira parte do trabalho analisou-se a influência, como catalisadores, de diversos 

líquidos iónicos na reação de esterificação do ácido oleico. Os líquidos iónicos avaliados 

foram os seguintes: 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate ([BMIM][HSO4]), 1-

butyl-3-methylimidazolium methanesulfonate ([BMIM][CH3SO3]), 1-butyl-3-

methylimidazolium methylsulfate ([BMIM][CH3SO4]), 1-metylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate 

([MIM][HSO4]) and tributylmethylammonium methylsulfate. Os valores obtidos para a 

conversão da reação de esterificação do ácido oleico mostraram que o líquido iónico 

[BMIM][HSO4] seria um dos mais promissores como catalisador.  

Numa segunda parte do trabalho procedeu-se ao estudo da recuperação do LI 

[BMIM][HSO4], tendo-se realizado diversas reações de esterificação do ácido oleico usando 

uma quantidade de catalisador de 10%, 15% e 20% (m/m) relativamente à massa de ácido 

oleico. As condições experimentais foram as seguintes: tempo de reação 6 horas, razão molar 

ácido oleico/metanol = 1/10 e temperatura 90 °C. Verificou-se que o rendimento da reação 

foi de 76,6 % para 10% de LI, 83,3% para 15% de LI e 84,8% para 20% de LI. Estes 

rendimentos diminuíram para 58,2% (10% de LI) com 4 atapas de reciclagem, 75,2% (15% 

de LI) com 5 etapas de reciclagem e 77,1% (20% de LI) com 5 etapas de reciclagem. Os 

resultados obtidos permitem confirmar que é possível reutilizar este LI em reações sucessivas

1 Introduction 

Over the last three decades, the realisation of the limited petrochemical based energy 

resources has motivated an intense search for alternative transportation vehicles fuels. In 

this context, a possible solution is a biofuel usable in compression ignition engines (or diesel 

engines), produced from biomass rich in fats and oils. Thus, a wide range of raw materials 

can be used in the production of biodiesel. However, the use of sources that do not compete 

with the food market, like waste cooking oils, which usually feature high levels of free fatty 

acids (FFA’s), can add problems to the classic process of biodiesel production through 

alkaline transesterification. These problems can be partially overcome by the use of 

catalysts, such as ionic liquids (IL’s) that promote also the reactions of esterification of 

FFA’s in biodiesel. 

One of the attractive characteristics of biodiesel is that its use does not require any 

significant modifications to the diesel engine, so the engine does not have to be dedicated 

for biodiesel. However, similar to alcohol fuels, biodiesel has lower energy content and 

different physical properties than diesel fuels [Tat et al., 2002].  

Biodiesel fuel has recently attracted increasing worldwide attention as a blending 

component or a direct replacement for diesel fuel in vehicle engines. For example, B5 used 

in Europe contains 5% of biodiesel (B100) and 95% of petro diesel. Biodiesel blends up to 

B20 can be used in nearly all diesel equipment and are compatible with most storage and 

distribution equipment [Ahmia et al., 2014]. 

Biodiesel is a non-toxic, biodegradable and renewable fuel. It has significantly lower 

emissions than petroleum-based diesel when it is burned, whether used in its pure form or 

blended with petroleum diesel. It does not contribute to a net rise in the level of carbon 

dioxide in the atmosphere and leads to minimize the intensity of greenhouse effect and 

biodiesel is better than diesel fuel in terms of sulphur content, flash point, aromatic content 

and biodegradability [Ahmia et. al., 2014]. There is a wide range of raw materials suitable 

for the production of biodiesel. However, first generation edible oils are the main resources 

for world biodiesel production.  

The main goal of this work consists in the study of the influence of IL's application in the 

catalysis of esterification and transesterification reactions which lead to the synthesis of 

fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) mixtures, which constitute the ester biodiesel products. The 

central focus is concerned with the study of IL recovery. For the recover and recycle of ILs 

the first used distillation. It is important to note that the interaction of ILs with water is

mainly affected by the size of ILs, hydrophobicity and hydrogen bonding ability of both 

cations and anions, will determine the techniques used for recovery of ILs.

1.1 Background and Motivation 
 

Alternative diesel fuel has attracted more attention in the last three decades. For this 

purpose, ester biodiesel has been studied as a source of bioenergy, which can potentially 

substitute petrochemical based diesel fuels. 

Wide range of raw materials can be used in the production of biodiesel.  It has the advantage 

of dramatically reduce sulphate, hydrocarbon and particulate matter emissions. It is nontoxic 

and does not contaminate water sources. Biodiesel is a fuel that can be made from pure or 

waste vegetable oils such as soy and rapeseed (canola) oils, and may be used in any diesel 

automotive engine in its pure form or blended with petroleum-based diesel, without the 

requirement of hardly any modification in the diesel engine, leading to a less-expensive, 

renewable and clean-burning fuel. However, the use of second generation non-edible 

sources, which do not compete with the food market like waste cooking oils and feature 

high levels of acidity, can induce difficulties in the operation of the classic process of 

production of biodiesel by alkaline transesterification. These problems can be overcome by 

the use of catalysts, such as ionic liquids (IL’s) that promote also the reactions of 

esterification of Free Fatty Acids (FFA’s) to biodiesel. In this work we will study the 

performance of imidazolium-based ionic liquids in the replacement of the classic 

homogeneous and heterogeneous, acid and alkaline catalysts generally used for the 

production of ester biodiesel. Imidazolium based ionic liquids are the most studied species 

for this type of applications, due to its inherent ionic patterns, low pressure and ability of 

self-organization in different states. This class of ionic liquids has been progressively used 

as green solvents in order to replace the volatile and relatively toxic organic solvents, in 

homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, materials science, nanomaterials, lithium ion 

batteries, and process separation technologies. Therefore, the main objective of this work 

consists in the study of the effect of the application of these IL's species in the catalysis of 

esterification reactions of organic acids to the corresponding methyl esters.

2 Biodiesel 
2.1 Biodiesel as a renewable energy source 
 

Biodiesel or ester based biodiesel is an alternative diesel fuel that is produced from 

vegetable oils and animal fat by transesterification with an alcohol (usually methanol). It is 

used as an additive to petrodiesel fuels, with different contents, promoting possible vehicle 

decreases greenhouse gas emissions up to 20%. It also can be used in its pure form as a 

renewable alternative fuel for diesel engines [http://www.renewableenergyworld.com]. 

Thus, biodiesel can be mixed in any proportion with petroleum diesel [Tat et  al., 2002] and 

it does not contribute to a rise of the net concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, 

and leads to minimize the intensity of greenhouse effects [Ahmia et al., 2014].  

 

2.2 Physicochemical properties 
 

Biodiesel is a liquid biofuel, which colour ranges from golden to dark brown, depending on 

the production method and is slightly miscible with water. The main biodiesel 

physicochemical properties are given in Table 1. 

Each of the most important physicochemical properties referred in Table 1 are explained in 

more detail below: 

Kinematic Viscosity: It is defined as the resistance to flow of a fluid under gravity. It is a 

basic design specification for fuel injectors used in diesel engines. For biodiesel it is a quick 

and easy method for estimating the stage of completion of a batch synthesis reaction 

[Biodiesel handling and use guide, 2016]. 

Carbon residue: The carbon residue of a fuel is the tendency of carbon deposits to form 

under high temperature in an inert atmosphere. Using ordinary diesel fuel, the carbon 

residue is measured using a 10% distillation residue. Because B100 boils entirely at the high 

end of the diesel fuel range and in a very narrow temperature range, it is difficult to leave 

only a 10% residue when distilling biodiesel. So, for biodiesel carbon residue 

measurements, all biodiesel samples have to be used rather than the 10% distilled residue 

[Biodiesel handling and use guide, 2016].

Total Glycerol: Total glycerol is the sum of free and bonded glycerol [Taimur, 2011]. 

Free Glycerol: Free glycerol is the glycerol present as molecular glycerol in the fuel. It 

results from incomplete separation of the ester and glycerol products after the 

transesterification reaction.  This can be a result of imperfect water washing or other 

approaches that do not effectively separate the glycerol from the biodiesel [Taimur, 2011]. 

Bonded glycerol: Is the glycerol portion of the mono-, di-, and triglyceride molecules. High 

values of total glycerin are indicators of incomplete esterification reactions and predictors of 

excessive carbon deposits in the engine. 

Sulphated Ash: Sulphated ash is a residue remaining after a fuel sample has been 

carbonized. The residue is then treated with sulphuric acid and heated to a constant weight. 

This test controls the mineral ash residual when fuel is burned. For biodiesel, this test is an 

important indicator of the amount of residual metals in the fuel that came from the catalyst 

used in the esterification process [Taimur, 2011]. 

Flash point: Flash point of a fuel is defined as the temperature at which it will ignite when 

exposed to flame or spark [Ved et al., 2013].  A minimum flash point for diesel fuel is 

required for fire safety. B100 flash point value must be at least 93°C to provide that all the 

excess alcohol introduced in the production process is removed from the final biodiesel 

product. 



 

7 
 

Sulphur:  Biodiesel must have less than 15 ppm in sulphur content, in order to reduce 

sulphate and sulfuric acid pollutant emissions [Biodiesel handling and use guide, 2016]. 

Pour point: The temperature at which the fuel contains so many agglomerated crystals, that 

it is essentially a gel and will no longer flow. Distributors and blenders use pour point as an 

indicator of whether the fuel can be pumped; otherwise it would not be suitable for use 

without heating or other treatment procedures [Biodiesel handling and use guide, 2016]. 

Cloud point: It is the most frequently used indicator of low-temperature operability. Fuels 

are generally expected to operate at temperatures as low as their cloud point. The cloud 

point of B100 is typically higher than the cloud point of conventional diesel fuel [Biodiesel 

handling and use guide, 2016]. 

Cetane number:  Cetane number is an indicator of the combustion speed of a diesel type 

fuel and the compression needed for ignition. A sufficient cetane number is needed for good 

engine performance. Normal diesel must have a cetane number of at least 40. [Biodiesel 

handling and use guide, 2016]. 

Higher Heating Value: Amount of energy released by the combustion of a unit value of 

fuel. 

Lower Heating Value: Amount of heat released by the combustion of a sample of fuel 

minus the energy needed for the evaporation of its water content. Therefore, the Lower 

Heating Value is always less than the Higher Heating Value.  

  

2.3 Benefits of biodiesel use 
 

The lower contribution of biodiesel use to the rise of the net concentration of carbon dioxide 

in the atmosphere and minimization of global greenhouse effects can be explained by an 

analysis of the biodiesel life cycle. Therefore, when oilseed plants grow, they take carbon 

dioxide (CO2) from the air to make the stems, roots, leaves, and seeds. After the oil is 

extracted from the oilseeds, it is converted into biodiesel. When the biodiesel is burned CO2 

and other emissions are released and returned to the atmosphere. Eventually, most of this 

emitted CO2 does not add to the net CO2 concentration in the air because the next oilseed 

crop will reuse the CO2 as it grows. A small part of the emitted carbon is fossil derived 

because of fossil fuel and chemicals used in farming and in the biodiesel production process. 

[Biodiesel handling and use guide, 2016].

2.4 Advantages and disadvantages of biodiesel 
 

Biodiesel has many major advantages, and some minor disadvantages. In Table 2 a 

comparison between ester biodiesel and petrodiesel main features is summarised. 

Table 2. Comparison of biodiesel with petrodiesel. 
Advantages  Disadvantages  

• Biodiesel is produced from renewable 

sources; biodiesel fuel is a renewable 

energy source. 

• In comparison with diesel fuel, 

biodiesel is less toxic [Hoekman et al., 

2012]:  

• Has lower emission of contaminants  

[http://www.conserve-energy-

future.com-2016]; 

• Lower health risk. Although burning 

biodiesel produces carbon dioxide, it 

does not contribute to global warming 

[http://www.conserve-energy-

future.com-2016];  

• B100 can reduce carbon dioxide 

emissions by 78% and lower the 

carcinogenic properties of diesel fuel 

by 94% [Azad et al., 2013] 

• Biodiesel is better for vehicle engines 

than conventional diesel: it provides 

greater lubrication [Azad et al., 2013]; 

• Biodiesel have a higher flash point 

(100? minimum) than diesel (52-

96?), which make biodiesel less 

combustible. It is safer to store and 

transport. 

• Biodiesel has about 10% higher 

Nitrogen Oxides (NOX) content 

than other petroleum products. 

Nitrogen Oxide is one gas that is 

used in the formation of smog and 

ozone. Once it gets dissolved in 

atmospheric moisture, can cause 

acid rain [http://www.conserve-

energy-future.com-2016]. 

• Biodiesel cleans dirt from the 

engine. This proves to be an 

advantage of biofuels but it is 

possible that this dirt may get 

collected in fuel filters and clog 

them [http://www.conserve-energy-

future.com-2016]; 

• B20 blends can be used in some 

very cold climates, where 

temperatures routinely fall below -

30?F (1?C) [Biodiesel handling and 

use guide, 2016], but biodiesel’s 

freeze point may be 20º to 30ºF 

higher than that of petroleum diesel, 

which may cause limitations in cold 

weather operability.

2.5 Energy balance 
 

According to biodiesel lifecycle studies, or energy balances, done by the United States 

Department of Energy, it was concluded that the production and use of biodiesel reduces 

78.5% of carbon dioxide emissions, unburned hydrocarbons and particulate matter. This can 

be explained by biodiesel's partially closed carbon cycle [Biodiesel Instructor-2011] referred 

above. Overall, from the biodiesel energy balance (see Table 3), it can be concluded that for 

a unit of fossil energy needed to make biodiesel, 4.5 units of energy are gained. On the other 

hand, regular fossil fuels take more energy to produce than they provide in return 

[http://articles.extension.org-2016].

2.6 The biodiesel production and consumption in the world  
 

Due to its non-toxicity and biodegradability, biodiesel has become an alternative fuel in the 

transportation sector, and a possible solution to environmental issues [Hassan et al., 2013]. 

The European Union is expanding its B5 (blend of 5% (v/v) biodiesel with 95% petrodiesel) 

blend to a B7 (blend of 7% (v/v) biodiesel with 93% petrodiesel) specification as part of the 

Fuel Quality Directive passed in December 2003. The renewable energy policy includes an 

obligatory 10% goal for transportation fuels such as hydrogen, biofuels and electricity.  This 

new requirement updated the 5.75% renewable substitution aim of 2010, determined in 

2003, to a more ambitious goal. However the 2003 aim of about 10% for biofuels in 2020 

was kept as an obligatory aim. The greenhouse gas aim for biofuels to take effect in 2011 

was set at a 35% decline when compared with fossil fuels. In 2017, the demand is raised to a 

50% decrease, and for new producers after 2017, the aim will be 60%

[www.biodieselmagazine.com-2016]. In Figure 1 the investment of different countries and 

regions in biodiesel production is preesented [Johanson et al., 2012]. 

 

  

Figure 1. Biodiesel production in different countries, 2009-2010 [Johanson et al., 2012]. 

 

2.6.1 Biodiesel Consumption  
 

Renewables sources have played an increasing role in the energy sector.  In 2015 their 

contribution was €16 billion and it is projected to be €58 billion in 2030, and  thanks to fast 

decreasing costs owing to technological advancement, especially in the power sector, 

renewables can also be gradually further integrated in the market. Biodiesel is the main 

biofuel used for transport in the EU, representing 79% of total use of biofuels in 2015. The 

main consumers of biodiesel are France, Germany and Italy. Renewable energy in Transport 

sector comes largely from biofuels (88%), with electricity playing a more limited role. In the 

EU, biofuels production exceeded by three times the planned trajectory, with around 3 

Million tons in 2015, mainly because of the utilization of used cooking oil. The share of 

biofuels produced from wastes and residues, like waste cooking oils, in the EU has 

increased from 1% in 2009 to 23% in 2015  [Renewable Energy Progress Report, 2017].

[Renewable Energy Progress Report- 2017] 

 

In EU, biodiesel consumption showed 0.5% marginal increase. In Figure 3, it is presented 

the production of biodiesel in Portugal after 2006. The data of 2016 to 2018 is a forecast. In 

Portugal the production of biodiesel from 2015 to 2016 increased 2.3% [Phillips et al., 

2016]. 

 

Figure 3. Production of biodiesel in Portugal 2006-2018 (Million litres) [Phillips et al., 2016]. 

 

2.6.2 Raw materials for Biodiesel production 
 

Biodiesel is produced from vegetable oils all over the world. But, for biodiesel production, it 

can also be used animal fats, like white grease or lard, fish fat and chicken fat [Ahmia et al., 

2014].  



 

12 
 

Figure 4 shows the relative importance of soybean oil as biodiesel feedstock in the EU and 

Portugal. It can be seen that soybean oil is the major feedstock in Portugal and the second in 

EU [Castanheira et al., 2015]. 

The most used oils for worldwide biodiesel production are rapeseed (EU), soybean 

(Argentina and USA), and palm (Asian and Central America) and sunflower, although other 

oils or fats are also used, including peanut, linseed, safflower, used vegetable oils, and 

animal fats [Romano et al., 2011]. 

On the other hand non-edible oil feedstocks range from castor oil to jatropha, tung, cotton, 

jojoba and microalgae oils, which proved to be highly promising and reliable sources, 

having high oil content. Algae oil, due to its availability and low cost is considered as an 

economical choice for biodiesel production [Gashaw et al., 2014].   

 

 

Figure 4. Feedstock used for biodiesel production in the European Union and Portugal   
[Castanheira et al., 2015]. 

Microalgae, a large and diverse group of aquatic organisms that lack the complex cell 

structures found in higher plants [Slade et al., 2013], appear to be a very important 

alternative for future biodiesel production due to its potential oil yield; however, its 

application for biofuel production is still commercially limited [Romano et al., 2011], due to 

the highly energetic intensive technologies available for algae oil recovery. 

 

2.7   Production of biodiesel 
 

The recent interests in biodiesel reside in the regular rises in oil prices and the disappearing 

resources of fossil fuels. These issues boosted the interest in biodiesel production from both 

animal and vegetable fats. In fact, intensive usage of petroleum based materials and fuels are 



 

13 
 

an important factor in air pollution: an extremely important problem, as mankind may face a 

global warming crisis [Earle et al. 2009]. 

Ester biodiesel, which is a mixture of Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAME), is made through 

the transesterification of animal fat or vegetable oils. Fats are mainly constituted by 

mixtures of triglycerides, which are triesters of glycerol, molecules with a glycerol core 

connected to 3 fatty acid chains by ester groups. The most important fatty acid ester 

derivative is oleic acid, but oils usually exhibit smaller contents of fatty acid saturated 

chains (of varying lengths) and some double unsaturated chains (like linoleic acid ester 

derivatives). For fatty esters, both acid- and base-catalysed transesterifications reactions are 

possible. However, base catalysed transesterification to methyl or ethyl esters usually 

require slightly higher reaction temperatures [Earle et al., 2009]. 

Biodiesel can also be produced by esterification of free fatty acids (FFAs) derived from 

vegetable oils, with separation of the water by-product from the FAME product. For fatty 

acids, the acid-catalysed esterification reaction is preferred. The base-catalysed esterification 

to methyl and ethyl esters is not used because the catalyst is deactivated by reaction with the 

carboxylic acid group to form a carboxylic acid salt, which is often called soap [Earle et al., 

2009]. 

Table 4 summarizes the biodiesel production processes: FAME is produced from vegetable 

oils, animal fats or waste cooking oils by transesterification. In the transesterification 

process a triglyceride reacts with an alcohol in the presence of a catalyst, forming a mixture 

of fatty acids esters and another alcohol. Using triglycerides results in the production of 

glycerol as a by-product [http://www.biofuelstp.eu - 2016].  On the other hand, vegetable 

oils and animal fats, which are typically branched or straight chain molecules, may also be 

hydrotreated in order to de-oxygenate the fatty acids and saturate any double bonds, 

producing paraffinic hydrocarbons. Synthetic diesel and gasoline can also be produced by 

gasification of dried wood, agriculture residues, straw, corn, garbage, food scraps, and 

sewage-sludge into synthesis gas, which is subsequently converted to hydrocarbon liquid 

products by Fischer-Tropsch processes. The overall processes are often called biomass to 

liquids (BTL) [Biomass Gasification Facility for Clean Synthetic Diesel Fuels - 2009].

2.7.1  Esterification and Transesterification 
 

The esterification process is used for the biodiesel production from free fatty acid. 

Esterification is the process of forming esters from carboxylic acids. Esterification occurs 

when a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol. The overall esterification process takes place 

according to the chemical equation shown in Figure 5. 

 

 
Figure 5. Biodiesel synthesis by esterification process from Free Fatty acid with alcohol [Maria et 

al., 2011]. 

 

In Figure 6 basic technology of biodiesel esterification process. 
 

 



 

15 
 

 
Figure 6. Basic technology of biodiesel esterification process.  

 

As stated above, the most used industrial process for ester biodiesel production is 

transesterification. This reaction of an alcohol with an ester to produce another alcohol and 

ester is a conversion process similar to hydrolysis, except that an alcohol is used instead of 

water. Suitable alcohols include methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, and amyl alcohol. 

Methanol is most frequently used, because of its low cost and its physical and chemical 

advantages [Hideki et al., 2001]. 

In this process, a three step reaction mechanism is assumed, where triglycerides and 

monoglycerides act as intermediates. The overall transesterification process occurs 

according to the chemical equation shown in Figure 7. 

 

 
Figure 7. Biodiesel synthesis by transesterification process from vegetable oils with methanol [Ullah 

et al., 2014]. 



 

16 
 

Considering a base catalysed process, an amount of alkali (for example NaOH) slowly 

dissolves in alcohol excess (usually methanol). This methoxide mixture is mixed with warm 

preheated oil at about 50?, and allowed to react for 1 to 8 hours to ensure a complete 

transesterification reaction. In pressurised conditions, the reaction mixture may be 

maintained above the alcohol boiling point (70?), but for normal pressure systems, it is 

recommended to maintain the temperature range from room temperature to 55 ?, for safety 

reasons. Under normal pressure conditions, the reaction time is usually from 1 to 10 hours, 

and it is important to avoid a sealed system in order to prevent the risk of explosion, because 

the reaction rate is doubled by raising the reaction temperature by 10 ?. In pressurised 

conditions and to prevent evaporation of the alcohol, the reaction should be carried out in a 

closed container [www.bioethanol.ru-2016] or using a reflux process. In Figure 8 it is shown 

the basic technology for ester biodiesel production. 

The use of mineral acids in acid catalysed processes has some disadvantages such as 

equipment corrosion, long workup procedure and environmental problems. Recently, 

replacement of these hazardous liquid acids by solid acid catalysts has been essential, but 

these catalysts show also some disadvantages such as low activity, easy deactivation and 

adsorption/desorption of products [Aghabarari et al., 2013].

3  Ionic liquids 

An ionic liquid is a molten salt consisting of a cation and an anion, with low melting 

temperature. The earliest discovery of ionic liquids (ILs) was in the mid nineteenth-century 

when “red oil”, generated by Friedel-Crafts reaction, was used as a solvent for separation 

analysis. In 1914 Paul Walden reported the first widely-known ionic liquid, ethyl 

ammonium nitrate. Interest in the study of ionic liquids became more intense in 1963, after 

the research project of Major (Dr.) Lowell A. King of the US Air Force Academy. Later, in 

1990, the professor from US Air Force Academy, Dr. Mike Zaworodko discovered the 

solution for the problems faced by Dr. King which gave a new dimension for using of ionic 

liquids in electrochemistry. Since then, due to its unique properties and possible uses, ILs 

drew the interest of scientific researches and even several industries [Terencia et al., 2010].   

ILs consist of ions and remain liquid at temperatures lower than 100 
?
C. Typical IL cations 

are nitrogen-containing (such as alkylammonium, N-dialkylimidazolium, N-alkylpyridinium 

and pyrrolidinium), or phosphorous containing (such as alkylphosphonium). The common 

choices of anions include halides, BF4– , PF6– , CH3CO2– , CF3CO2– , NO3– , Tf2N–  

[i.e.,(CF3SO2)2N]– , [RSO4] and [R2PO4] [Zhao et al., 2012].  The overall properties of ILs 

derived from the composite properties of the cations and anions and include those that are 

superacidic, basic, hydrophilic, water miscible, and water immiscible and hydrophobic. The 

anion is currently used to control the water solubility, but the cation can also influence the 

hydrophobicity or hydrogen bonding ability [Huddleston et al., 2001].  Some cations and 

anions are shown in Figure 9. 

Imidazolium-based ionic liquids have been used as green solvents to replace the volatile and 

relatively toxic organic solvents, in homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, materials 

science, nano materials, lithium ion batteries, and separation technology. Imidazolium based 

ionic liquids, because of its inherent ionic patterns, low pressure and ability of self-

organization in different states, are considered as the most studied species [Woon et. al., 

2012].

3.1    Classification of ionic liquids 
 

Ionic liquids are good solvents, environmentally benign, nonvolatile, nonflammable, and 

stable in air or water. Because of these special properties, ionic liquids have been widely 

investigated as solvents for synthetic chemistry and catalysis [Zhang et al., 2007]. Ionic 

liquids are generally divided into two broad classes, one based on chlorometallate anions 

such as heptachlorodialuminate ([Al2Cl7]-) and the other based on anions not containing 

metals, such as hexafluorophosphate ([PF6]-) [Andreani et al., 2012]. There are a large 

number of imidazolium-based ILs, few ILs based on quaternary ammonium have been 

reported. Quaternary ammonium salts (“quats”) because of its surface-active properties, 

possess anti-microbial activity are an economically advantageous class of industrial 

compounds. Most of these solvents remove lignin and alter cellulose structure, which 

increases the accessibility of cellulolytic enzymes [Visser et al., 2007].

ILs plays a crucial role when applied as solvents or catalysts for different reactions at high 

temperatures, or if the reaction products should be distilled from the ionic liquid at high 

temperatures Ammonium and phosphonium ILs both can decompose at elevated 

temperatures, but phosphonium salts are generally more stable as their ammonium analogs 

[Stojanovic et al., 2011]. 

In this work different Ionic Liquids, were studied, with structures presented in Figure 11.

3.2 Ionic liquid properties 
 

 ILs has many positive properties such as low flammability, high ionic conductivity, high 

thermal conductivity, high dissolution capability toward many substrates, high thermal and 

chemical stability [Zhao et al., 2012]. The ionic liquids possessed greener properties such as 

significantly less toxic compared to the organic solvent. In addition, they can be colourless, 

have high catalytic activity, low viscosity, potential recyclability, and are easily 

manipulated. The highly interesting characteristic of ionic liquids is the ability of designing 

a molecule, target for a particular application or in order for getting a certain set of 

properties such as melting point, viscosity, density, water solubility and selectivity 

[Andreani et al., 2012]. ILs contains large, organic cations with a variety of anions and 

melts at or below about 100 °C [Huddleston et al., 2001]. The active research of ILs as 

alternative solvents and catalysts in the chemical or enzymatic (biocatalytic) production of 

biodiesel has gained momentum [Hua et al., 2013].  The first industrial process involving 

ionic liquids was announced in March, 2003, by BASF, and is called BASIL (Biphasic Acid 

Scavenging Using Ionic Liquids). This process generates an ionic liquid in situ to remove 

HCl formed during the production of alkoxyphenylphosphines. The resultant 

alkoxyphenylphosphine is used as an important precursor for the synthesis of photoinitiators 

used in various industrial processes. The ionic liquid is separated from the product and can 

be removed by decantation, presenting advantages of cost and easiness compared to 

filtration. The use of ionic liquids increases the yield of this process by a factor of 80,000 

compared to the conventional process [Andreani et al., 2012]. ILs have great chemical and 

thermal solubility which is also tuneable based on the combination of cation and anion. For 

biodiesel synthesis, the ILs is capable of dissolving a wide array of substrates and more 

importantly, increasing their stability over a longer period during the reaction. The ionic 

liquids (ILs) offer an excellent media for many lipase-catalysed esterification or 

transesterification reactions compared to the organic solvents wherein an increased in the 

activity and specificity of the lipase enzyme was spotted. Many recent studies, proved the 

ILs as more environmental friendly solvents and catalysts for biodiesel reactions and 

separation [Muhammad et al., 2015]. 

Ionic liquids can be used as single catalysts in the processes of biodiesel production, either 

by esterification or transesterification, provided that some ionic liquids present Bronsted 

acidity or basicity.  



 

21 
 

Bronsted acidic ILs, were highly efficient catalyst for biodiesel synthesis from vegetable 

oils. Sulfuric acid groups in these ILs are the active sites for transesterification [Guo et al., 

2011]. 

Currently, there are several scientific works published about the production of biodiesel 

using ionic liquids. Some of these works are referred in Table 5. 

• Ren and co-workers studied the production of biodiesel using as catalyst [Hnmm] 

OH, a basic ionic IL. The raw material used was soybean oil. They analysed several 

reaction parameters such as the influence of catalyst concentration on the biodiesel 

yield, the effect of methanol / soybean oil molar ratio and the effect of reaction time. 

The authors found out that the catalyst had an excellent catalytic performance at 70 

°C reaction temperature, 1.5 h of reaction time, 3% wt catalyst dosage and a molar 

ratio of MeOH/oil = 8/1. The obtained reaction yield was about 90% [Ren et. al., 

2014]. 

• In 2011, the production of biodiesel was studied by Guo et al., using as catalyst 

[BMIM][CH3SO3] –FeCl3 and [BMIM][CH3SO3] –AlCl3, a basic ionic IL. The raw 

material used was Jatropha oil. At high temperature of 120 °C, the reaction time 5 h. 

  ??3+ had a relatively higher activity than that of Al3+ (99.7% vs. 94%). 

• Using palm oil and BMIMHSO4 as catalyst, a reaction temperature of 160 ºC, 1 h for 

the reaction time and 1% wt of catalyst, [ Elsheikh et al., 2011], obtained a reaction 

yield of 98.4%. 

• In another experiments from Fang and his colleagues different catalysts [C4MIM] 

[NTf2] and [C2MIM][TfO] were used for production of biodiesel. During all 

experiments raw material used Soybean oil. The first experiment was at room 

temperature, second experiment was at 50 °C and reaction time is  12 h. The reaction 

yield was 96 % and 80 % [Fang et al., 2014]. 

• For production biodiesel is used triolein oils with different catalysts 

([C18MIM][NTf2] and [C16MIM][NTf2]), a basic ionic IL. The process was doing in 

the same temperature (60°C). The one experiment was a 6 h; another experiment was 

a 24 h. The reaction yield was 96 %, 99% [Fang et al., 2014]. 

• The production of biodiesel from waste cooking oil was studied by Ullah and co-

workers. They used as catalyst BMIMHSO4, a basic ionic IL. The catalyst was 

efficient in the first hour of reaction with the yield reaching up to 95.65%. After that 

there was no considerable change in the yield, therefore the reaction time of 1 h was 



 

22 
 

identified as the optimum reaction time, at high temperature of  160 °C [Ullah et 

al.,2015].

3.3 The role of ionic liquids in transesterification reactions 
 

 

In biodiesel production from vegetable oils and animal fats, depending on the catalyst used, 

there are specific characteristics related with these reactions. For example, acid catalysts are 

mainly used when the oil has a high concentration of free fatty acids, with sulphuric and 



 

23 
 

sulfonic acids as the most common catalysts of this class. As disadvantages, the acid 

catalysis requires the use of large amounts of alcohol additionally; acid catalysts such as 

sulphuric acid catalyse the transesterification of triglycerides slowly even when refluxing 

with methanol, leading to long reaction times such as 48-96 hours. And there is the risk of 

corrosion of the equipment used due to the high acidity of those catalysts [Adreani et al., 

2012]. 

Ionic liquids are more expensive than conventional solvents and catalysts used in chemical 

reactions. Two of the most commonly used ionic liquids are 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium 

tetrafluoroborate ([BMI][BF4]) and 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate 

([BMI][PF6]) [Andreani et al, 2012]. But the use of ionic liquids in catalytic systems seems 

to be environmentally secure. The possibility of recovery and reuse of ionic liquids 

minimizes the waste in catalytic reactions. Ionic liquids have been using in most number of 

chemical reaction types. The important advantage of using ionic liquids in reactions is their 

non-volatility except at high pressures and low temperatures. ILs possesse numerous 

advantages over the conventional organic solvents (they possessed greener properties such 

as very low relative volatility i.e., wide liquid temperature and significantly less toxic 

compared to the organic solvent).  More important is their ability to selectively dissolve 

various organic, inorganic, and organometallic materials due to their tuneable polarity which 

can be designed for specific purposes. In view of the environmental friendly nature of ILs, 

the catalyst also referred to as green catalyst. ILs is considered prospective catalysts for 

biodiesel production. Using ILs based catalyst could reduce the number of reactions and 

purification steps required in the biodiesel preparation and separation hence rendering the 

process to be more economically competitive [Muhammad et al., 2015]. 
 

3.4 Ionic Liquids recovery 
 

In nowadays ILs can be used for developing new processes that are technologically, 

environmentally and economically advantageous. However ILs has typically high costs. So, 

for an improvement in the economic, efficiency the recycling and reuse of ILs are critical.  

Also, recovery of ILs is important to minimise the environmental concerns of the disposal, 

like biodegradation and toxicity (they can be mixed with other products). Even though ILs is 

considered as homogeneous catalysts because they are in the same phase as the reactants, its 

capability to be recovered and recycled is an advantage over conventional homogeneous 



 

24 
 

solvents.  For the recovery and recycle of ILs the most used method is distillation, because 

ILs show low vapour pressures. It is important to note that the interaction of ILs with water, 

which is mainly affected by the size of ILs, hydrophobicity and hydrogen bonding ability of 

both cations and anions, will determine the techniques used for its recovery. Among these 

effects, the nature of anions largely determines the behaviour of the IL-water mixture. 

Hydrophobic ILs which is immiscible with water can be easily separated from water by 

decantation. Additionally, many molecular solvents including water are immiscible with ILs 

and can be used to extract or separate materials from the IL solutions [Freire et al., 2007]. 

For the recovery of ILs there are used different methods  

• Distillation is the simplest method for the recovery of ILs. First ILs is removed by 

decantation, filtration and/or extraction, and also by washing with water/organic 

solvents. After that, distillation can be used for recycling and reuse of ILs [Mai et 

al., 2014]. For example [BMIM][FeCl4] IL is heated in the oven at 105 ºC for 24 h to 

evaporate water [Fauzi et al., 2014]. For recovery of [BMIM][HSO4], it is washed 

with distilled water to remove any impurities, and afterwards heated in the oven at 

105 ºC for 24 h to remove traces of water and unreacted methanol [Fauzi, 2014]. 

[HMIM][HSO4] can be used in the ester exchange reaction after washing with ethyl 

acetate; excess ethyl acetate was removed by reduced-pressure distillation. It was 

found that [HMIM][HSO4] recycled 4 times can still retain stable catalytic 

performance [Xu Wei et al., 2015]. Adsorption can be used for retaining ILs onto 

solid supports such as activated carbon (AC), silica (SiO2), alumina (Al2O3), 

titanium dioxide (TiO2), and clays [Mai et al., 2014]. 

• After reaction the water was added to the reaction mixture and then the solid was 

isolated by filtration. The IL in water could be recovered easily by evaporation at 80 

ºC in a vacuum. The recovered IL was washed with diethyl ether and dried at 80ºC 

in a vacuum for 1h [Abbaspour-Gilandeha, 2014]. 

• An alternative method for recovery ILs which does not use high thermal application 

is extraction of IL using carbon dioxide. Blanchard and Brennecke demonstrated the 

separation of an ionic liquid ([BMIM] [PF6]) from a number of organic compounds 

using supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO2) extraction method. The method is 

effective because organic compounds are soluble in CO2, while ILs is insoluble. This 



 

25 
 

enabled the separation of organic compounds from IL, and depressurization is then 

applied to remove solutes from CO2 [Fauzi et al., 2012]. 

• Recovery of ILs can also be performed by crystallization processes. Using this 

method, crystals of ILs are easily separated from the reaction mixture as they are in 

different phases. The temperature at which the IL solidifies are important in this 

method. Hayyan studied the use of 1-butanol as an anti-solvent for the separation of 

choline chloride from glycerin after the transesterification process. After the 

introduction of the anti-solvent into the glycerin phase, the temperature was reduced 

to -20 °C, and the crystals of choline chloride were separated. Further filtration under 

vacuum was required to recover the IL [Fauzi et al., 2012]. 

In Table 6 recent published studies are shown involving ILs recovery for reactions of 

biodiesel production, using different oils and ionic liquids, emphasizing the effects of 

reaction and time reaction on production yield.

4 Experimental  
4.1  Introduction 
 

The first experimental task of this work was the selection of a suitable ionic liquid in order 

to study the effect its recovery and use in a set of 4 or 5 consecutive esterification reactions. 

All the 5 ILs available in the LQA laboratory were tested and only one IL was chosen. 

Then, several esterification reactions were performed using three different amounts (%) of 

ionic liquid. After each reaction, the obtained samples were separated in aqueous and 

organic phases by decantation and centrifugation. Both organic (biodiesel) and aqueous 

(with ionic liquid) samples were dried and stored in the refrigerator (4 ºC) for further 

analysis. After each reaction test, the reaction yield was determined using the acidity of the 

organic phase measured by volumetric titration. The characterization of the produced 

biodiesel samples was measured qualitatively and quantitatively by determination of Fatty 

Acid Methyl Esters content by the Gas Chromatography (GC). Additionally, initial and final 

samples of the selected ionic liquid were characterized by UV-Vis and FT-IR spectroscopy. 

 

4.2  Chemicals and Equipment 
 

Oleic acid (cis-9-octadecenoic acid) (?90%) was purchased from Fluka and heptadecanoate 

methyl ester (?97%), used as internal standard in the GC analysis was obtained from TCI 

Company, Japan. Five different ionic liquids: 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen 

sulfate (?94.5%), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium methyl sulfate (?95%), 1-

methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate (?95%), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium 

methansulfanate (?95%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Switzerland and the 

tributylmethylammonium methyl sulfate  from Chem Cruz Company, United States. It was 

also used: Methanol (?99.9%) from Carlo Erba; heptane (?90%) from Fluka; potassium 

hydroxide from Riedel-deHaen; hydrochloric acid (?37%) from Fisher; Ethanol (absolute) 

and diethyl ether (?99.8%) from Carlo Erba; and sodium tetraborate and anhydrous sodium 

sulfate were obtained from Carlo Erba. 37 FAME mix standard solution from Supelco, and 

sulfuric acid (?95.0-97.0%) from Sigma-Aldrich, Switzerland, were also used.

The characterization of biodiesel samples was performed using a VARIAN CP-3800 Gas 

Chromatography system equipped with a FID detector. For ILs characterization (before and 

after recovery) a Barnstead Lab Line 3618-5 Vacuum Oven from Thermo Scientific, a 

VARIAN Cary 50 UV-Vis and a FT-IR ABB model MB3000 spectrophotometers were 

used. 

 

4.3  Biodiesel Production by Esterification Reaction 
 

The esterification reaction was carried out in a 100 mL glass reactor with continuous 

stirring, connected to a reflux condenser and a thermometer (Figure 12). The methanol and 

oleic acid (1:10 molar ratio), in this order, were added into the glass reactor. The reactor 

containing the mixture was then immersed into a paraffin bath. The reactor was then heated 

until a temperature of 90oC and methanol was added to the reactor.

The reaction was stopped after 6 hours and then the reactor was cooled to room temperature. 

It was verified the formation of a single phase inside the reactor. After cooling, the mixture 

was removed from the reactor and transferred into centrifugal tubes (Figure 13). Then the 

mixture was centrifuged during 20 minutes at 3000 rpm and the samples inside the tubes 

were stored in the fridge (4 ºC).

After 24 h into the fridge, the mixture was able to separate into two phases. The phases were 

separated using a pipette and the mass of each phase was measured using an analytical 

balance Adam Equipment ADA-210/I Balance. 

Both phases were then stored in 10 mL brown flasks inside the fridge for further analysis: 

acidity determination, and characterization by GC, UV-Vis and FT-IR. 

 

4.4  Recovery of ILs  
 

In this work the esterification reaction was studied for biodiesel production using ILs as 

catalysts. The reactions were carried out with three different [BMIM][H2SO4] amounts 

(10%, 15% and 20% wt). In each reaction the IL samples were recovered and reused in a 

following reaction test maintaining the same IL amount relating to the initial oleic acid 

weight. 4 runs were done in 10% reaction sequence, and for 15% and 20% reactions 

sequences, 5 runs were done. The recovery procedure is described below:  

a. After 2 days from the reaction test, the separation of phases were concluded (see 

Figure 14); 

b. The organic phase (biodiesel) was analysed by calculating its acidity;

c. The water phase was treated by evaporation for IL recovery: first it is heated for 1 

hour at 110 ? afterwards the sample is introduced in a vacuum oven at 60?  for 12-

15 h (see Figure 15).

After evaporation, the ILs were recovered and used for the next reaction. In Figure 16 there 

are presented examples of phases before and after IL recovery for the 15% and 20% runs.

4.4.1  Biodiesel Acidity Measurements  
 

For biodiesel analysis a titration method was used (Method EN 14104:2003). First, an HCl 

0.1M solution was prepared and standardized with borax. Then, a KOH alcoholic 0.1 mol/L 

solution was prepared and its concentration was checked with the standardized HCl 

solution. After that 1L of solvent (Ethanol/Diethyl ether 1/1) was also prepared and the 

standardized solution of KOH was diluted to a 0.01M concentration. These solutions were 

used for the determination of the acidity of oleic acid and biodiesel samples. 

a) Determination of acidity of oleic acid/biodiesel (with alcoholic solution of KOH) 
 

For volumetric titration diethyl ester/ethanol 1:1 (v/v) solution was used as the solvent and 

phenolphthalein was used as the indicator. First 40 mL of solvent were titrated adding 5 

drops of phenolphthalein and stirring the mixture while the KOH standard solution was 

added from the burette in order to neutralize the solution until the color changes to light 

pink. After that 1 mL of biodiesel sample was weighed using a precision balance, and 

titrated with the same solvent, until achieving pink color. 

The acidity of the samples is determined by equation 1.

The produced biodiesel is a result from the reaction between oleic acid and methanol, in the 

presence of a catalyst (IL). Biodiesel is constituted by methyl esters. The yield of the

4.5  Analysis of Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME) Content by Gas 
Chromatography  

 

For the determination of FAME content of all biodiesel samples a VARIAN CP-3800 gas 

chromatography equipment was used (see Figure 17). The system has a FID detector (Flame 

Ionization Detector) and a Supelcowax-10 capillary column (30mx0.25mmx0.25?m). The 

conditions used for analytical method were: 

 

• Helium flow-rate (carrier gas): 1 mL/min 

• Oven: 50 ?C (2 min); 4 ?C/min until 220 ?C (total running time: 80 min) 

• Injector temperature: 250 ?C (split ratio 1:5) 

• Sample volume: 1 µL

4.5.1 Identification of FAMEs Compounds Methodology  
 

The chromatogram obtained for the GC analysis using the Supelcowax-10 column of the 

standard mixture is presented in Figure 18.  

  

Figure 18.  GC chromatogram obtained for the Supelco 37 FAME standard mix using a Supelcowax-
10 column. 

The elution order (numbers in the chromatogram) and the retention time of each one of all 

the 37 methyl esters compounds present in the standard mixture were obtained by 

comparison with the analysis using an Omegawax 250 column (similar stationary phase) 

already published by Sigma-Aldrich (Supelco Bulletin 907). This chromatogram, used as 

reference, is showed in Figure 19.

Comparing both chromatograms it is possible to identify the retention time (and elution 

order) for the 37 FAMEs, as it is presented in Table 8.

4.5.2 Characterization of Oleic Acid 

 
For a nearly complete esterification test which could provide a characterization of the ?90% 

oleic acid used in the experiments, an esterification was carried out using sulfuric acid as the 

catalyst. For the analysis of biodiesel produced by GC, the sample was prepared as 

described below: 

• Measure 250 mg of oleic acid or biodiesel to a 10 mL flask.  

• Add 5 mL of heptane or IS (internal standard) solution (10 mg heptadecanoate 

methyl ester/mL). 

• Shake the solution and let it stand for 1 min. 

• Dry the solution adding a micro-spatula of anhydrous sodium sulfate. Shake and let 

the solution stand until clarification (near 5 min). 

• Inject 1 µL of the prepared solution. 

 

4.5.3  Determination of FAME Content 
 

For determination of FAME content of all obtained biodiesel samples (10%, 15% and 20% 

IL), it was used the methodology presented by European Standard EN 14103-2003 (using an 

internal standard - heptadecanoate methyl ester). 

To calculate the FAME content, expressed as a mass content in percentage, the following 

equation was used: 
 
 

? =
( ??)????

???
?  ???????

?
? 100%  (3) 

 
where: 

?? - total peak area from the methyl ester in C14 to that in C24:1; 

??? - peak area corresponding to methyl heptadecanoate; 

??? - concentration of the methyl heptadecanoate solution being used, mg/mL; 

???-  volume of the methyl heptadecanoate solution being used, mL; 

? - mass of the sample, mg; 

For calculated methyl ester area and the total FAMEs area, was used the following equation:

4.6 Ionic Liquid Analysis with UV Spectrophotometer 
 

For this analysis the VARIAN Cary 50 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer was used (see Figure 

20). 

Preparation the sample: 

• Measure 0.05 mL of Ionic Liquid to a 100 mL flask.  

• Add 100 mL of methanol (MeOH). 

• Shake the solution manually. 

• Then measure 0.5 mL of the solution to a 50 mL flask. 

• Add 50 mL of MeOH. 

• Analyse the solution by UV.

4.7 Ionic Liquid Analysis with Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy 
(FTIR) 

 

Mid-Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a highly reliable and well recognized fingerprinting 

method. By this analysis more substances can be characterized, identified and also 

quantified. By IR spectroscopy spectra from a very wide range of solids, liquids and gases 

can be obtained. For ILs characterization a FTIR ABB MB300 spectrometer was used (see 

Figure 21).  

 

Figure 21. FTIR ABB MB300 spectrometer. 

 

As with all FT-IR measurements, an infrared background is collected, in this case, from the 

clean ATR crystal. The crystals are usually cleaned by using a solvent soaked piece of 

tissue. Typically water, methanol or isopropanol are used to clean ATR crystals. The ATR 

crystal must be checked for contamination and carry over before sample presentation, this is 

true for all liquids. After the crystal has been cleaned and an infrared background has been 

collected, the liquid is simply poured onto the crystal. The whole crystal must be covered if 

performing a quantitative or qualitative analysis. The crystal is recessed into the metal plate 

to retain the sample (see Figure 22).

5 Results and Discussion 
 

5.1 The Selection of the Ionic Liquid 
 

For the selection of the best ionic liquid for the esterification reaction, between oleic acid 

and methanol several experiments were made using different IL´s as catalysts. The 

parameters for each reaction and the conversion are presented in Table 9, for the IL´s used 

and also for sulfuric acid. Amount of sulfuric acid was a 10%. 

For the experiments done with ionic liquids as catalysts the molar ratio between oleic acid 

and methanol was 1/10 and the quantity of IL was 10%, 15%, 20 % of oleic acid. In the first 

experiment 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate was used as catalyst. And the 

reaction time was 2 hours. After the reaction, it was necessary to wait 7 days for the 

separation of phases. After that time some water was, added to the mixture and then this 

mixture was left to rest for 2 days and after separation of phases occurred.  The yield of this 

reaction was a 57.7 %. The second experiment was done in the same way, but this time 1-

butyl-3-methylimidazolium methyl sulfate was used as catalyst and reaction time was 4 

hours. With this IL the separation of phases occurred after 2 days. And the conversion was a 

76.4 %. For the experiment 3 the catalyst used was 1-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate. 

The reaction time was 6 hours. Right after reaction finished, the phases separated. Next day 

it was possible to separate the phases and measure the respective masses. The conversion 

was 88.5 %.

The reaction using 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium methanesulfanate as catalyst took 6 hours. 

In this case the phases took 2 weeks to separate. It was verified that the acidity of organic 

phase was a higher compared to the other experiments and the conversion was only 18.4 %. 

The next experiment was done using tributylmethylammonium methyl sulphate as catalyst. 

The conditions used to the reaction were the same as before. In this case the phases separated 

after one week. But yield was very low, only 15.4 %. The esterification reaction was also 

done using sulphuric acid as catalyst, to have a “complete” esterification. The obtained yield 

was 99.0 %. After these first experiments we decided to continue the work using 

[BMIM][HSO4] as catalyst:  because, this IL is one of the best ILs which have the higher 

yield and with this ILs have a study which continue in this work [Alimova, 2016]. Also, after 

esterification, a separation phase was faster than using other ILs. 

Several experiments were made using [BMIM][HSO4] as catalyst and the percentage of IL 

was varied (10%, 15% and 20%). Acidity of oleic acid was a 183.7482, reaction time 6 h, 

reaction temperature 90oC. In Table 10 presented the results.

The conversions obtained for these experiments are in the range 76.6% -79.7% %. In Figure 

23 is presented a picture of the biodiesel obtained in these reactions. The biodiesel has a 

yellow color.

5.2 Internal Standard characterization 
 

The quantification of the ester and linoleic acid methyl ester content in biodiesel samples 

can be performed using the European Standard EN 14103 (April 2003). The methodology 

proposed implies the use of methyl heptadecanoate (minimum purity of 99%) as internal 

standard for GC analysis (10 mg/mL in heptane). However, since the solid available for this 

work has a purity of 97.5%, it was decided to study if this standard can add some impurities 

to biodiesel samples analysis. 

The GC chromatogram obtained for the methyl heptadecanoate solution (10 mg/mL) is 

presented in Figure 24.

Figure 24. GC chromatogram obtained for the methyl heptadecanoate solution (10 mg/mL). Both 
figures represent the same chromatogram (right figure used to visual identify the main peaks in 

baseline). 

From the right amplified chromatogram we can see three main impurities (peak area above 

10000) present in the standard solution. With this analysis it was possible to obtain the 

purity for the internal standard solution of 99.2% (higher than the value indicated in the 

label of the reagent flask, ?97.5%). This value was obtained by the ratio of the area of 

methyl heptadecanoate and the total area of all peaks having a minimum area of integration 

of 10000. This integration parameter as well as a signal to noise ratio of 1:5 was used for all 

the biodiesel samples analysis, presented in the following sections. It was decided not to 

consider all these impurities added by the internal standard in the quantification process for 

all the samples obtained in the recovery studies. The retention times of these non- identified 

(NI) peaks are 43.6, 45.3 and 77.4 min, for 1, 2 and 3, respectively. 

 

5.2.1 Complete esterification of Oleic Acid using sulfuric acid 
 

Other experimental task was the characterization of the oleic acid used as organic raw 

material for the esterification reaction to produce biodiesel. This reagent was available with 

a purity of ?90% and it was decided to measure the maximum quantity of methyl ester 

obtained by a “complete” esterification using sulfuric acid as catalyst. 

The GC analysis of biodiesel sample obtained by esterification with sulfuric acid and 

analyzed using the internal standard methodology is presented in Figure 25. 



 

42 
 

 
Figure 25. GC chromatogram obtained for the biodiesel sample obtained from esterification using 

sulfuric acid and with the addition of the internal standard. 

 

The analysis of this chromatogram shows two main peaks: first the peak of the methyl ester 

of heptadecanoate, used as internal standard, and then the peak of oleate (from oleic acid) 

and elaidate (from elaidic acid) methyl esters that co-elute. There are also three small peaks 

that represent the esterification of other fatty acids present in the original oleic acid reagent: 

(from palmitic, stearic and linoleic acids, respectively). The experimental concentration of 

oleic acid methyl ester was 96.6% (g oleic methyl ester /g total fatty acid methyl esters). 

 

5.3 Characterization of biodiesel samples using different amounts of 
ionic liquid 

 

To study of the effect of the recovery of the [BMIM][HSO4] in the performance of the next 

esterification step, 3 esterification reactions (With 10%, 15% and 20% amounts of ILs) were 

carried out followed by 4 (10% amount of IL) and 5 (15%, 20% amounts of IL) recovery 

steps. For the first recovery only 4 reactions, because after fourth recovery of IL mass was 

very small. The yields obtained for the reactions carried out with higher amounts of IL (15 

wt% and 20 wt%) are higher than those obtained for the reactions with 10 wt% of IL. In 

Table 11 are presented the obtained results of conversion for these reactions.

In Figure 26 is presented biodiesel conversion dependencies from amount of catalyst and 

recovery runs. It is possible to verify that when amount of ILs increase also increase 

biodiesel conversion.

ILs 10%, 15%, 20%. 

 

For doing recovery, the flask containing the water phase was weighted, after added water 

phase. After recovery was measured the flask and ILs together. After four successive 

reactions mass of IL decreased about 60.8 % (reaction with ILs 10%), in reaction with 20%,  

15% IL after 5 runs the mass of IL decreased about 28 % and in reaction with 20% of IL, 

the IL mass decreased 23.8 %. All results are presented in Table 12.

same methodology explained before (EN 14103-2003). The experimental concentrations (g 

FAMEs/g biodiesel) values are 61.2%, 49.4%, 43.5% and 56.2%. Concentration of REC 

10.4 was a higher then Rec 10.2 and Rec 10.3: probably it was experimental error.

5.4  ILs analysis by UV-VIS 
 

Ionic liquids can be transparent in the near-ultraviolet and visible spectral regions, in 

contrast to many other polar organic solvents. This makes that ionic liquids are very 

interesting solvents for spectroscopic measurements on dissolved metal salts and metal 

complexes. For the quality control of ionic liquids, UV/VIS spectrophotometry was applied. 

It is an efficient method [Nockemann- 2005].  The effect of the recovery steps in the quality 

of the ionic liquid was studied by UV-VIS spectroscopy. The spectrum of original IL and 

the ILs recovered after the final esterification reaction, for each %IL is presented in Figure 

31. The original ILs has a yellow colour, but the recovery ILs sample has a little bit dark 

colour. In Figure 31, the absorption spectra of samples of the ionic liquid [BMIM][HSO4] 

are shown. The spectra were recorded in a 1 cm quartz cell. The absorption spectrum of the 

original ionic liquid (red, solid line) shows an absorption maximum around 260 nm.  

 

Figure 31. UV-Vis spectrum obtained for original and the recovered ILs obtained for different 
amount of ILs (10, 15 and 20%). 

 

The original ionic liquid [BMIM][HSO4] 0.11 absorbance threshold shifts for the original 

ILs sample from 200 nm to about 260 nm,  the spectra of the recovered not  differ from each 

other’s and show absorption bands at for ILs (REC20 ) 200 nm to 250 nm ,for ILs (REC15) 

200 nm to 264, for ILs (REC10) 200nm to about 255. Spectroscopic results prove the 

[BMIM][HSO4] after recovery retained stable catalytic performance. 



 

49 
 

5.5 ILs analysis by FTIR 
 

The effect of the recovery steps in the quality of the ionic liquid was studied by Fourier 

Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) spectroscopy.  

The molecular formula for the ionic liquid, 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate 

is [BMIM][HSO4]. Figure 32 shows the structural formula of the sample. 

 

Figure 32. Formula 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate. 

 

The spectrum of original IL, methanol and the ILs recovered after the final esterification 

reaction, for each %IL is presented in Figures 33 to 36.  It is commonly acknowledged that 

the characteristic absorption peaks of [BMIM][HSO4] appear at 3148 cm-1 , 3101 cm-1 , 2962 

cm-1 , 2869 cm-1 , 1566 cm-1 , 1464 cm-1 , 1220 cm-1 , 1160 cm-1 , 1030 cm-1 , 835 cm-1 , 755   

cm-1. And for methanol 555 cm-1.

6. Conclusions and Future work 

The effect of different reaction for biodiesel production was studied using different ionic 

liquid as a catalyst. The study of the esterification of oleic acid with ionic liquids was 

carried out for obtaining high yield biodiesel production. For analyzing the biodiesel 

samples was used a GC.  

In this dissertation different esterification reactions were carried out with different kind of 

ILs.  The conversion varied between an 18 -88 %. For the study we selected [BMIM] 

[HSO4] ionic liquid. The reaction yield was found to be 76.6% to 10% IL, 83.3% to 15% IL 

and 84.8% to 20% IL. These yields decreased to 58.2% (10% IL) with 4 cycles of recycling, 

75.2% (15% IL) with 5 cycles of recycling and 77.1% (20% IL) with 5 cycles of recycling. 

In this work the FAME content was calculated: values of around 50-60% of FAMEs / g 

biodiesel sample. Another 40-50% could be in the organic phase (as acids) or in the aqueous 

phase. 

For analyzing the ILs was used UV-VIS and FTIR. And found that it retained stable 

catalytic performance after recovery. 

 

Future work 

In this thesis work, there are some further important researches that need to study. In this 

dissertation esterification reaction, were carried out for biodiesel production, using methanol 

and oleic acid and ILs as a catalyst. Though, in the future experiments will be testing other 

acids for biodiesel production.  

The IL ([BMIM] [HSO4]) recovery was.  Catalyst recovery was a 5 time (5 recycling). 

However, in the future experiments will be for improving conditions of recovery:  heating 

time and temperature. Improve the recovery runs to increase 6-8 times.  And also in the 

future experiments will be testing other ILs for recovery. 

In this work used GC analysis for biodiesel sample, and UV-VIS and FTIR for ILs analysis. 

But in future have to be doing the FTIR analysis for oleic acid. And use more methods for 

analysis.

	The characterization of biodiesel samples was performed using a VARIAN CP-3800 Gas Chromatography system equipped with a FID detector. For ILs characterization (before and after recovery) a Barnstead Lab Line 3618-5 Vacuum Oven from Thermo Scientific, a VARIAN Cary 50 UV-Vis and a FT-IR ABB model MB3000 spectrophotometers were used.

	6. Conclusions and Future work
	The effect of different reaction for biodiesel production was studied using different ionic liquid as a catalyst. The study of the esterification of oleic acid with ionic liquids was carried out for obtaining high yield biodiesel production. For analyzing the biodiesel samples was used a GC. 
	In this dissertation different esterification reactions were carried out with different kind of ILs.  The conversion varied between an 18 -88 %. For the study we selected [BMIM] [HSO4] ionic liquid. The reaction yield was found to be 76.6% to 10% IL, 83.3% to 15% IL and 84.8% to 20% IL. These yields decreased to 58.2% (10% IL) with 4 cycles of recycling, 75.2% (15% IL) with 5 cycles of recycling and 77.1% (20% IL) with 5 cycles of recycling. In this work the FAME content was calculated: values of around 50-60% of FAMEs / g biodiesel sample. Another 40-50% could be in the organic phase (as acids) or in the aqueous phase.
	For analyzing the ILs was used UV-VIS and FTIR. And found that it retained stable catalytic performance after recovery.
	Future work
	In this thesis work, there are some further important researches that need to study. In this dissertation esterification reaction, were carried out for biodiesel production, using methanol and oleic acid and ILs as a catalyst. Though, in the future experiments will be testing other acids for biodiesel production. 
	The IL ([BMIM] [HSO4]) recovery was.  Catalyst recovery was a 5 time (5 recycling). However, in the future experiments will be for improving conditions of recovery:  heating time and temperature. Improve the recovery runs to increase 6-8 times.  And also in the future experiments will be testing other ILs for recovery.
	In this work used GC analysis for biodiesel sample, and UV-VIS and FTIR for ILs analysis. But in future have to be doing the FTIR analysis for oleic acid. And use more methods for analysis.
