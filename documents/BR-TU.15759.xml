Resumo 

 
Scaffolds para a Engenharia de Tecidos (ET) representam hoje em dia a principal 

estratégia nas terapias de reparação e regeneração óssea. Estas estruturas, actuam 

essencialmente como materiais de suporte à formação de tecido. São tipicamente 

semeadas com células e ocasionalmente com factores de crescimento, 

proporcionando desta forma uma matriz extra-celular (MEC) artificial e temporária para 

as células formadoras de osso, os osteoblastos. 

Nano-fibras de policaprolactona (PCL) obtidas por eletrofiação e hidrogéis à base de 

péptidos auto-agregantes (self-assembling peptides - SAPs), já demonstraram o seu 

potencial para funcionarem como MECs artificiais, capazes de promoverem a adesão 

e a captação celular. A combinação de ambos os sistemas na forma de um material 

compósito para suporte de células em engenharia de tecido ósseo revelou ser bem-

sucedida. 

Este trabalho descreve a produção de um novo substituto ósseo poroso destinado a 

promover a penetração de osteoblastos. O substituto consiste numa arquitectura 3D 

com camadas alternadas de fibras de PCL com hidrogel, e decorado com sinalizadores 

químicos para favorecer a orientação celular. Esta estrutura explora a capacidade das 

nano-fibras de PCL para imobilizar moléculas adesivas, após um tratamento superfical 

apropriado, com a possibilidade de introduzir moléculas solúveis, tais como factores 

de crescimento, no hidrogel. 

O tratamento superficial foi realizado por plasma à pressão atmosférica, para reduzir 

a hidrofobicidade das fibras de PCL, resultando num ângulo de contacto com a água 

de 0º, demonstrando assim a sua eficácia. Este tratamento permitiu a deposição de 

grupos amina capazes de interagir com os grupos aldeído presentes no fragmento da 

vitronectina humana (351-359), uma sequência adesiva que promove a adesão 

específica de osteoblastos. Os resultados da viabilidade celular demonstraram que a 

adesão celular dependia da concentração de HVP, não dependendo do tratamento 

superficial por plasma. Um scaffold decorado com moléculas bioactivas ordenadas de 

forma a fornecer um gradiente de sinalizadores químicos para as células foi montado 

e comparado com um scaffold para controlo, o qual não incluiu nenhuma espécie de 

moléculas bioactivas. Ambos resultaram numa espessura total de cerca de 0,30 mm. 

A análise por microscopia confocal revelou que as células migraram ao longo da 

espessura dos scaffolds até, pelo menos, 50 ?m de profundidade, e a utilização de 

moléculas bioactivas mostrou-se benéfica em termos de proliferação celular.

 Abstract 

 
Scaffolds for Tissue Engineering (TE) represent nowadays the leading strategy for 

bone reconstruction and regeneration therapies. The scaffolds essentially act as 

templates for tissue formation and are typically seeded with cells and occasionally with 

growth factors, providing a temporary and artificial extra cellular matrix (ECM) for bone-

formation cells - the osteoblasts. 

Polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofibres obtained by electrospinning and hydrogels from 

self-assembling peptides (SAPs) have already demonstrated their potential as artificial 

ECM capable to promote cell attachment and uptake; and the combination of both 

systems as a composite material has been shown to provide successful results in 

supporting cells functions in bone TE. 

In this work, the bottom-up production of a novel bone substitute construct intended to 

promote osteoblasts penetration is described. The substitute is composed by a multi-

layer scaffold with alternated layers of electrospun PCL fibres and hydrogels from SAPs 

in a 3D architecture decorated with appropriate chemical guidance cues. This structure 

explores the advantages of PCL nanofibres to immobilize adhesive molecules after an 

appropriate surface treatment, and the possibility of hydrogels to incorporate soluble 

molecules, such as growth factors.  

Surface treatment done by atmospheric pressure plasma efficiently reduced the 

hydrophobicity of the PCL matrices, resulting in a water contact angle of 0º. This 

treatment allowed the deposition of functional amino groups able to interact with the 

aldehyde groups presented in the fragment of human vitronectin (351-359), an 

adhesive sequence that promotes the specific adhesion of osteoblast-like cells. Cell 

adhesion results, demonstrated that cell attachment is concentration-dependent of the 

HVP molecule, and does not depend on the plasma surface treatment itself. A 

functionalized scaffold decorated with bioactive molecules orderly disposed in a 

gradient, was assembled and compared with a control scaffold, which did not comprise 

any type of biofunctionalization. Both resulted in a thickness of around 0.30 mm. 

Confocal microscope analysis showed that cells could migrate, at least, to a depth of 

50 ?m for both scaffolds, presenting a higher proliferation in the functionalized one, 

suggesting the efficiency of the bioactive molecules to sustain the cellular viability.

CHAPTER 1 – INTRODUCTION 

 

1.1 Theoretical Framework  

The twentieth century was marked by extraordinary social and medical achievements. With the gain of 

life expectancy, the need for new therapies becomes fundamental to respond to age-related widespread 

conditions such as obesity, bone disorders, and allied pathologies.1 Respecting to bone disorders, osteoporosis 

is by far the most common bone disease, representing worldwide a huge personal and economic toll. This 

problem is characterized by compromised bone strength predisposing to an increased risk of fracture that, 

converted in numbers, represents more than 8.9 million fractures annually, portraying one of the major causes 

for disability in Europe.2 The capability for bone to regenerate and repair itself represents an important 

mechanism to overcome these adversities. However, the bone structure gradually loses its valence over time, 

requiring even surgical interventions when the fractures reach a critical size. Traditionally, surgery for bone 

tissue reconstruction opts for the most common reconstructive and repair strategies – the use of bone grafts or 

implants. There are three main types of bone grafts: autografts, allografts, and bone graft substitutes. 

Nonetheless, despite the success of these therapeutic solutions, some drawbacks have been pointed out. 

Concerning the autografts, it disadvantages lays in the limited availability and the fact of mandating an 

additional surgical procedure with associated donor-site morbidity, risk of infection, and additional cost. In its 

turn, allografts lack the osteoactive capacity of autografts and carry the risk of infectious agents or immune 

rejection. To overcome these limitations, Tissue Engineering (TE) appears as an outstanding alternative for the 

treatment of traumas that can lead damage and degeneration of tissues in the human body.3,4 

Regenerative and Reparative Medicine (RRM) encompasses tissue engineering and biomaterials in the 

search for new health solutions. The principle of TE relies extensively on the use of three-dimensional (3D) 

porous matrices, commonly known as scaffolds. Nowadays, TE scaffolds are the leading technique of repair 

and regeneration of bone defects. These scaffolds essentially act as a template for tissue formation and are 

typically seeded with cells and occasionally growth factors. They should allow cell’s rapid integration and 

coalescence into the needed tissue and, hence, start the bone regeneration process. Apart from serving as a 

temporary and artificial extra cellular matrix (ECM) for growing cells which degrade overtime; scaffolds can 

be used as a reservoir to deliver bioactive agents to promote regeneration of the injured tissues. An ideal bone 

graft or scaffold should be made of biomaterials that imitate the structure and properties of natural bone ECM, 

include osteoprogenitor cells and provide all the necessary environmental cues found in natural bone. 5 Even 

though the advances in developing new biomaterials for applications in bone substitutes has been steeply 

increasing, yet none biomaterial hold all the ideal characteristics. A successful bone substitute must exhibit 

biocompatibility and bioresorbability, possess other essential biologic properties, including selective osteogenic 

potential, high levels of osteoinductivity and vascularization, good osteoconductivity and integration with host 

tissue, also known as osseointegration, and be cost-effective. The problems with the current scaffolds and tissue 

engineered constructs are usually related with their limited osseointegration and lack of vascularity.4,6 



 

24 

 

Converging nanotechnology into TE has provided the ability for materials to be tailored to tune with ECM 

mechanical and physical properties, and to be designed at their molecular level. It represents an important factor 

in constructing and processing the future composite and integrated materials. Materials with appropriate 

physical characteristics such as high porosity and interconnectivity have been designed and engineered to 

facilitate material/cell interactions, nutrient/oxygen infiltration, and vascularization. Furthermore, the 

incorporation of ECM proteins or ECM-derived peptides or protein fragments which engage integrins and direct 

osteoblast adhesion and differentiation, has given biomaterials a fundamental tool to signal and manipulate cell 

behaviours towards tissue formation.  

One of the most evolving strategies for producing bone substitutes is through the using of composite 

scaffolds. Electrospun fibres and hydrogels are examples of polymeric structures commonly used as scaffolds. 

Electrospun fibres have been widely used in TE as scaffolds for cell culture due to their unique biomimetic 

properties characterized by interconnected porous structure with high porosity, high surface area, fibre 

diameters in the sub-micron range, variable pore size distribution, versatility in materials selection, 

reproducibility, and the ability to be tailored into a variety of sizes and shapes.7 Hydrogels greatest property 

relates with their degree of flexibility very similar to natural tissue due to their large water content. They are 

capable to mimic the physiochemical and biological properties of natural ECM of tissues such as cartilage and 

bone. The low level of bioactivity of electrospun fibres represents its major disadvantage, while hydrogels most 

common problem is regarding their poor mechanical properties.8 Hydrogels reinforced with electrospun fibres 

represents an outstanding strategy with potential for bone regeneration due to the merging of both unique 

properties. Moreover, combining these two systems into a scaffold provides a solution to overcome their 

individual limitations.  

Electrospun fibres can be produced through a wide range of materials. Polycaprolactone (PCL) 

nanofibres are now commonly used due to their properties viable for biomedical applications.9 PCL fibres in its 

origin offer a hydrophobic environment that cannot favour cell functions. Since osseointegration and long-term 

success of the implant are determined by the complex reactions taking place at the tissue-material interface, 

PCL fibres require surface modifications. Molecular processes driving cell adhesion and growth have focused 

the treatment of implant surfaces on improving the surface-to-cells interaction, complying with the new 

approach of “biochemical functionalization”. Most promising approach involves the decoration of surfaces of 

the implant with adhesive sequences or osteogenic growth factors.1 In its turn, hydrogels can be produced using 

self-assembling peptides (SAPs). Hydrogels from self-assembled peptides have a potential to serve as synthetic 

extra cellular matrices.10 Their excellent properties can offer three-dimensional supports for cell growth, and 

can become vehicles for the delivery of stem cells, drugs, or bioactive proteins. This can be explained by the 

unusual stable structures that some peptides form when self-assembled, such as ?-sheets structures. Many SAPs 

have been designed as ?-sheet peptides. SAPs with ?-sheet structures have repeated alternating hydrophobic 

and hydrophilic amino acids along a linear sequence. After ?-sheet formation, this results in two distinct faces 

of hydrophobic and hydrophilic character. It is believed that is this hydrophobic character between two ?-sheets 



 

25 

 

that gives the ability to encapsulate guest molecules that also impart in hydrophobic environments (like cells 

and some drugs), making SAPs hydrogels viable for cell-penetration and uptake.11 

 

1.2 Aim of this thesis  

The aim of this thesis is to provide a novel bone substitute construct intended to promote osteoblast 

penetration. Exploring the advantages of electrospun fibres and hydrogels from SAPs, we aim to design a multi-

layer composite scaffold by alternating both systems in a 3D structure. The multi-layered scaffold should be 

produced to mimic the natural bone tissue with appropriate porosity to allow all the necessary transport within, 

and a suitable environment for cell growth and migration. The design of a nano-fibrous/nano-porous structure 

mimicking an ECM environment must be able to reproduce the typical biochemical stimuli characteristic of 

lifelike bone regeneration process. These stimuli will be generated through the insertion of matrix-bound 

bioactive molecules, such as adhesive molecules, in the nanofibres, and the incorporation of soluble molecules, 

such as growth factors, in the hydrogels. These two approaches combined along the scaffold aim to create a 3D 

gradient intended to signalize and guide bone-forming cells (osteoblasts), when seeded in our structure, to the 

places needed for ossification. This gradient will be disposed in an orderly manner in such a way to give viability 

to cells and sustain their proliferation and migration functions. By addressing these points, besides offering an 

in vitro validated prototype for the in vivo studies, we expect to build an innovative multi-layered porous 

scaffold decorated with gradient of appropriate bioactive molecules to foster the adhesion and the spread of 

osteoblasts throughout the entire volume of the bony support, and, finally, ensure osseointegration, immediate 

loading, and long-term success of the implant.  

 

1.2.1 Objectives of this thesis 

? Produce and morphologically characterize layers of micro- and nanofibres of PCL obtained by 

electrospinning; 

? Graft specific functional groups through atmospheric pressure plasma and evaluate their 

availability in the chemoselective ligation with adhesive sequences; 

? Compare the cellular adhesion on surfaces functionalized with adhesive molecules at different 

concentrations;  

? Build manually a multi-layered porous scaffold decorated with a gradient of appropriate 

adhesive cues and growth factors embedded in hydrogel.

CHAPTER 2 – BIBLIOGRAPHIC REVIEW 
 

2.1 Bone Tissue and Cells  

Bone is a tissue characteristic of the vertebrate animal’s class. Being a specialized tissue in the loading 

of forces and stress, bone is an essential supportive structure of the body, characterized by its rigidity, hardness 

and regeneration ability. It serves to guard necessary organs, produces blood cells, acts as a mineral reservoir 

for calcium, and maintains acid-base balance. Bone is also responsible to convert the muscle contraction in 

movement of whole body through the formation of the lever system of the body.12 It is a composite material 

consisting of crystals of mineral bound to proteins. This provides both strength and resilience so that the skeleton 

can absorb impact without breaking.13 It is a kind of tissue composed by bone cells and a bone matrix comprising 

organic and inorganic components. The mineral-inorganic phase of bone consists of small crystals containing 

calcium and phosphate ions, called hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2), and this inorganic component constitutes 

about 50% of the total bone weight. This mineral is bound in an orderly manner to a matrix that is made up 

largely of a single protein, type I collagen. Bone consists of 70% inorganic component (mainly hydroxyapatite), 

20% organic component, and 10% of water. Collagen type I represents around 90% of the organic content. 14,15 

To provide the body with a frame that is both light and strong, bones are hollow. Due to the connection of the 

collagen fibres and hydroxyapatite, dense bone is formed. The outer dense shell is called cortical bone, which 

makes up roughly 75% of the total skeletal mass. Inside the cortical shell is a fine network of connecting plates 

and rods called trabecular bone, that makes up the remaining 25 percent.13 

Bone is a dynamically and highly vascularized metabolized tissue hosting osteocytes (entrapped within 

the bone matrix), osteoblasts (the bone-forming cells) and osteoclasts (cells committed to bone resorption) 

hierarchically and spatially organized within the ECM.14 ECM is present in all living tissues. The ECM in bone 

is distinguished from the others because of its mineralization. It confers a structural support for tissues, serves 

as a site for cell adhesion and determines the mechanical properties of the skeleton. However, it has been 

recently recognized that ECM plays far more dynamic role in regulating cell function and tissue morphogenesis. 

In the context of bone, ECM components can play a role in modulating the assembly of the structural matrix, 

particularly in organizing the process of matrix mineralization. As well, the ECM can bind to extracellular 

growth factors; cell bound ligands and receptors, and proteases. Bone matrix consists of amorphous and 

fibrillary components. The amorphous component is formed by proteoglycans (glycosaminoglycan chondroitin 

sulphate and keratin sulphate) and structural glycoproteins (osteonectin, sialoprotein, osteocalcin, binding 

calcium ions). The fibrillary component corresponds to the already mentioned collagen-organic part of the 

bone.16 Bone is covered by collagenous connective tissue called periosteum and its inner cavity is lined by 

endosteum. Both structures are composed of outer connective tissue layer and inner cellular layer formed by 

osteoprogenitor cells (that differentiate into osteoblasts) and pre-osteoblasts. Endosteum is much thinner that 



 

28 

 

periosteum and ensures the nutrition of bone. It is also source of new osteoblasts which are used for growth and 

remodelling of bone.17 

Throughout life, bone is constantly changing in size, shape and position. Two processes guide these 

changes – modelling and remodelling. Both modelling and remodelling involve the cells that form bone, 

osteoblasts, and the cells that break down bone, osteoclasts. In remodelling, there is an important local 

interaction between osteoblasts or their precursors (the cells that will develop into osteoblasts by acquiring more 

specialized functions – a process called differentiation), and osteoclasts or their precursors. The differentiation 

and function are regulated by osteotropic hormones and cytokines.14 Osteogenesis is roughly assumed to 

ossification by the medical dictionary, i.e., the natural formation of bone. This, together with the modelling and 

remodelling stages, encompasses the processes involved in bone’s life span. All these processes are mediated 

by osteoblasts, which work in tight cooperation with bone-resorbing osteoclasts.18,19  

Osteoclasts are the principal cells involved in the reabsorption of bone. As bone as being destroyed, 

these cells are committed to remove it, and to make deposition of new bone. This process is named bone 

remodelling, and occurs with calcium release.20 When bone is in resorption stage, osteoclasts are located at the 

bone surface. They provoke the losing of tissue, creating depressions nominated as re-entrances or Howship’s 

lacunaes. Besides the osteolytic function, osteoclasts play an important role in the bone development and growth 

by releasing growth factors from the mineralized ECM. Osteoclasts differentiate in contact with the bone 

throughout mononuclear hematopoietic progenitor cells. They can be found in the bone marrow together with 

the cells that generate osteoblasts.  

Osteoblasts are engaged in bone formation, i.e., the production of bone matrix. During the functional 

remodelling process of bone structure, regarding the adaption to mechanical forces and stresses, these cells play 

a fundamental role. They derive from precursor cells that can also be stimulated to become muscle, fat or 

cartilage; however, under the right conditions, these cells change (or differentiate) to form new bone. 

Osteoblasts are responsible for the process of  mineralization of the osteoid tissue.21 They are mononuclear cells 

that synthesize the organic ECM of bone, including collagen type I alpha 1, osteocalcin, osteopontin, 

osteonection, alkaline phosphatases, proteoglycans, as well as growth factors, stored within the bone matrix and 

in charge of the regulation of bone growth.20,22 Osteoblasts lay down bone in orderly layers that add strength to 

the matrix. Generally, they line on the bone surface and are called as bone lining cells. Some of the osteoblasts 

are buried in the matrix as it is being produced and these are now called osteocytes.14 

Osteocytes are the most numerous cells in bone and are extensively connected to each other – osteocyte 

perilacunar matrix - and to the surface of osteoblasts by a network of small thin extensions. They represent the 

mature form of the osteoblast. Very small changes in the shape of the bone can act on the osteocytes, which 

produce chemical signals that allow the skeleton to respond to changes in mechanical loading.23 Figure 2.1 

illustrates all the compartments of bone matrix as well as the cells involved in the bone remodelling process.

The recruitment of osteoblasts to the injured sites represents the key to the development of new anabolic 

bone remodelling strategies. The principle of this process involves an understanding of molecular mechanisms 

that accommodate the functioning of bone-producing osteoblasts. The recruitment of osteoprogenitors to the 

bone surface is an indispensable aspect of bone formation, and modulating this process could offer unique 

properties for anabolic treatment of osteoporosis and other metabolic bone disorders.18 Skeletal morphogenesis 

involves highly coordinated sequential steps of cell migration, aggregation, condensation and organogenesis. 

Cell migration is a dynamic process that requires the coordinated formation and disassembly of focal adhesions 

and rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton. Although the underlying mechanisms in osteoblast lineage cells 

are still poorly understood there is evidence that the osteoprogenitors are attracted, together with blood vessels, 

by chemotactic factors released from the mould, a process known as chemotaxis.24  

Chemotaxis is a fundamental process in which cells migrate directionally when they are exposed to 

external chemical gradients. Recruitment of osteoblast lineage cells to the sites programmed for ossification or 

in need of new bone formation conceivably relies on precisely controlled temporal and spatial chemotactic 

navigation signals. Molecules attracting cells are called chemoattractant or chemokines. Chemotaxis can be 

positive or negative respectively whether the cell moves toward an increasing or decreasing concentrations of 

chemokines.25 For example, the balance between bone formation and degradation is normally tightly controlled; 

however, it becomes deregulated, shifting towards more degradation under pathological conditions or during 

aging, thereby leading to osteoporosis. This tight balance implies the existence of mechanisms coordinating the 

differentiation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts as well as their migration to locations where they function. This 

mechanism is known as osteoclastogenesis and can be described as a process in which the presence of specific 

cues can control the differentiation of both precursor cells, avoiding over-degradation. Likely, in inflammatory 

response, chemotaxis is crucial for macrophages migration in the site of inflammation. In this case, chemo-



 

30 

 

attractants are released by the tissue in the previous phase of coagulation and clot degradation. There are  

multiple candidate guidance cues that may be involved in the directional migration of osteoblasts and their 

precursors: constituents of the bone matrix, such as fragments of collagen or osteocalcin, complement 

fragments, inflammatory cytokines and growth factors that are typically released, activated or produced at sites 

of matrix resorption.26 

Growth factors are polypeptides that can either stimulate or inhibit cellular proliferation, differentiation, 

migration, adhesion, and gene expression. Growth factor’s effects are concentration-dependent. Due to their 

control of many biological processes, growth factors are finding widespread use in the regeneration of many 

tissue types such as musculoskeletal, neural, hepatic and vascular systems.27,28 Enhance the in vitro and in vivo 

efficacy of growth factors passes through incorporating them into polymeric biomaterials (such as hydrogels) 

to maintain their stability and control their release kinetics. The release of these factors is then controlled by 

diffusion and/or scaffold erosion or degradation mechanisms. The application of growth factor in delivery 

systems are of utmost importance in the field of tissue engineering, namely, bone and cartilage regeneration.29

2.2 Designed Materials for Bone Tissue Engineering 

The term ‘Tissue Engineering’ was officially coined at a National Science Foundation workshop in 1988. 

TE aims to “regenerate damaged tissues instead of replacing them, by developing biological substitutes that 

restore, maintain or improve tissue function”. The regeneration of a whole (or partial) tissue or organ requires 

a complete understanding of the tissue/organ properties. Knowing their characteristics and transferring them to 

a structure that will be biologically accepted, constitutes the first criteria to develop a biological substitute with 

predictable success. Nowadays, TE scaffolds are the leading strategy of repair and regeneration of bone defects. 

Their construction is mostly based in the advances in materials science, especially in the field of biomaterials, 

where structures are specifically designed for specific purposes.5 

Biomaterials play a pivotal role towards the design of ideal bone grafts substitutes. Biomaterials can be 

polymer-based (natural or synthetic), ceramic-based, metallic-based, and composites. The most accepted 

definition of biomaterials is currently the one employed by the American National Institute of Health that 

describes biomaterial as “any substance or combination of substances, other than drugs, synthetic or natural in 

origin, which can be used for any period of time, which augments or replaces partially or totally any tissue, 

organ or function of the body, in order to maintain or improve the quality of life of the individual”.30 

Biomaterials have passed through an evolution process over time. Three major generations of biomaterials can 

be found: first generation, second generation and third generation. Briefly, the first generation of biomaterials 

relies on the capability of the material to be biologically inert, or bio-inert. They were intended for mechanical 

support and the major functionality of preventing rejection. This class include metals (e.g., titanium and titanium 

alloys), certain synthetic polymers (e.g., PMMA, PEEK), and some ceramics (e.g., alumina, zirconia). The 

second generation evolved to the new concept of bioactive/bio-resorbable materials. This class is categorized 

by materials that, besides the advantages of the 1st generation, can also stimulate regeneration and adopt a 

strongly biomaterial-bone interface form. Synthetic and naturally derived biodegradable polymers, calcium 

phosphates, carbonates and sulphates, and bioactive glasses are included in this class. Lastly, the third generation 

presents the outstanding and widely studied strategy emerging continuously in the field of regenerative 

medicine. Third generation bone grafts substitutes try to get close to the autograft standard. Integrating the 

bioactivity and biodegradability achieved in the second generation, third generation improvements motivate the 

development of biomaterials in modulating the response of host osteoblast and osteoprogenitor cells to the 

implant, inducing biological responses at molecular level. In this category are included the high porous 

scaffolds, nanotechnology based strategies, and the cell/gene/growth factor/loaded scaffolds.4 

The design of 3D biomaterials able to mimic the complex structural and biochemical functions of the 

ECM is the current and most challenging aim of TE studies. For that reason, the selection of a biomaterial able 

to induce and enhance osseointegration, and bone formation is of utmost importance in bone TE. A successful 

orthopaedic biomaterial must support the adhesion, organization, differentiation and matrix mineralization of 

osteoblasts and osteoprogenitor cells, key factors for optimal osseointegration. The limited osseointegration in 

the current orthopaedic biomaterials represents the major drawback for the success of the current bone 



 

32 

 

substitutes. Also, the lack of vascularity in scaffolds and TE constructs is of major concern. The ability for 

materials to be molecularly designed represents an important factor in constructing and processing the future 

composite and integrated materials. Bioinspired strategies have included functionalizing implants with ECM 

proteins or ECM-derived peptides or protein fragments which engage integrins and direct osteoblast adhesion 

and differentiation. Different peptides can be designed to promote cell adhesion to the implanted biomaterial, 

proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis or a combination of effects, what makes them highly versatile tools.15 

The design of materials still allows the tune with the desired mechanical and physical properties. Materials with 

appropriate physical characteristics such as high porosity and interconnectivity have been designed and 

engineered to facilitate material/cell interactions, nutrient/oxygen infiltration and vascularization. The capacity 

to control the porosity and pore size within a scaffold is of major importance. The porosity should be high 

enough to provide sufficient space for cell adhesion, ECM regeneration and minimal diffusional constraints 

during culture. The pore structure should allow even spatial cell distribution throughout the scaffold to facilitate 

homogeneous tissue formation. Ideally, the structures of the scaffold must be highly porous, with open pores 

and fully interconnected. Micro-porosity with pores less than 10 ?m is needed for capillary ingrowth and cell-

matrix interactions. Macro-porosity with pore sizes of 150?900 ?m allows for nutrient supply and waste 

removal of cells grown on the scaffold. Depending upon the cell type, the optimal pore diameters are 20?100 

?m.6,31,32 

One of the most evolving strategies for producing bone substitutes is through the using of polymeric 

scaffolds. Electrospun fibres have been widely used in TE as scaffolds for 3D cell culture due to their unique 

biomimetic properties characterized by interconnected porous structure with high porosity, high surface area, 

fibre diameters in the sub-micron range (tuneable between 50 nm and 5 ?m), variable pore size distribution, 

versatility of materials selection, reproducibility, and the ability to be tailored into a variety of sizes and shapes. 

The production of 3D network structures from electrospun fibres is intended for mimicking the characteristics 

of ECM, where cells can anchor, grow and perform their multiple functions, to bring back to the tissue it natural 

functionality.33,34 Electrospun fibres can be produced through a wide range of polymers. Various synthetic and 

natural polymers, such as proteins, and the blend of both types can be used. Examples of natural polymers 

include collagen, chitosan, cellulose acetate, silk protein, chitin, fibrinogen, among others. Typical synthetic 

polymers are hydrophobic biodegradable polyesters, such as poly(?-caprolactone) (PCL), poly(lactic acid) 

(PLA), poly(glycolic acid) (PGA), polyurethane (PU), the copolymer poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), and 

the copolymer poly(L-lactide-co–caprolactone) [P(LLA-CL)].7 Normally, the fibre diameter of the matrices 

conform to the structural properties of the ECM are on the order of 80-500 nm. It has also been reported that 

biocompatibility of a material improves with decreasing fibre diameter. Fibrous scaffolds can be designed 

combining micro- and nano-fibres unto stratified architecture. Alternating micro- and nano-fibres, it can be 

easily created an environment to facilitate cellular infiltration into the scaffolds. It has been reported that cells 

are able to easily migrate to a depth of about 100 ?m.32

Another emerging strategy in the field of TE involves the use of hydrogels. Hydrogels are promising 

materials for bone and cartilage regeneration. Equally, hydrogels present very particular characteristics that 

allow them to be used in the biomedical and pharmaceutical applications. It greatest property relates with their 

degree of flexibility very similar to natural tissue due to their large water content. They are capable to mimic 

the physiochemical and biological properties of natural ECM of tissues such as cartilage and bone. Hydrogels 

represent a group of polymeric materials that can be either from synthetic and natural origins. The porous 

structure of hydrogels enables the transfer of low molecular weight nutrients and cellular waste, which is vital 

for cellular life. In addition, biocompatible and biodegradable hydrogels can direct the migration, growth, and 

arrangement of cells during regeneration processes.8,35 However, the major drawbacks regarding the use of 

hydrogels lays in their poor mechanical properties and low bioactivity, making them inappropriate for hard 

tissue.36 To improve their bioactivity, is taken the advantage of hydrogel’s ability to recreate the natural 

mechanisms by using synthetic low-molecular weight peptides able to aggregate by spontaneous self-

assembling. SAPs hydrogels are nano-structural materials that can act as nano-fibrous scaffolds with an average 

of 10 nm in fibre diameter with pores between 5-200 nm. These structures can be easily functionalized with 

chemotactic factors, growth factors or adhesive peptides, providing favourable environments for culturing cells, 

triggering tissue regeneration, and for releasing drugs.37 Moreover, when mixed together with other porous 

polymer scaffolds, the peptide scaffolds enhanced osteoblast growth and differentiation.38 

Hydrogels reinforced with electrospun fibres represent a revolutionary strategy with potential for bone 

regeneration due to the merging of both unique properties. However, only few studies have been reported on 

fibrous scaffolds for application in bone TE. In literature is reported a combination where SAPs hydrogels 

were mixed with PCL in solution to produce electrospun fibres. This presents a path to assess the potential of 

modulating the excessive softness of those hydrogels and to add biomimetic molecules to PCL scaffolds. 

Indeed, these scaffolds can emulate the natural ECM (for its porosity and water content) and possess improved 

mechanical properties due to the fibres ability to reorient under deformation, stiffening, strengthening and 

toughening the system. Danesin, R. et al, proved that the enrichment of fibres with peptides produced higher 

surface wettability, and enhanced h-osteoblast adhesion to maintain osteoblast differentiation and to stimulate 

the expression of several genes.36,39 Khorshidi, S. et al, prepared a hydrogel/fibre scaffold for osteochondral 

regeneration, possessing gradient in both phases. In this experiment, they had come with the idea of 

amalgaming hydrogel and fibres to obtain composites encompassing gradient features to restore osteochondral 

matrix. This idea aims at overcoming the inherent limitations of both individual scaffold systems - the innately 

scarce cell migration of fibres and poor mechanical properties of hydrogels. Mehdi-Sahad et al, fabricated a 

3D cell-laden three-layered hybrid scaffold incorporating a 2D mat layer of poly(hydroxybutyrate) and nano-

hydroxyapatite fibres (diameter 2.0±0.2 ?m) between two layers of methacrylated gelatin/Hap. All the results 

showed an improvement in the mechanical properties when compared to the hydrogel itself; however, they 

were still inferior to the natural tissue. To overcome this problem, it has been suggested an increasing in the 

thickness of the electrospun mat located at the centre of the scaffold. But, this approach would lead to a denser 



 

34 

 

electrospun mat, with decreased porosity that would potentially hindered cell penetration into the electrospun 

centre.40   

 A scaffold designed as the one planned to obtain in this work, presents an original and innovative idea. 

First, assembling alternating layers of hydrogel/electrospun fibres onto a stratified architecture allows 

controlling the nano-fibrous structure of both systems in terms of fibre morphology, since their production is 

done individually. The mechanical properties of hydrogels are expected to be improved whatsoever, although 

knowing that the loading of the substitute will be far from the mechanic loading exhibited by natural bone. This 

type of combination permits the incorporation of different kind of bioactive molecules:   

 (1) Matrix-bound bioactive molecules, as adhesive sequences, decorating the surfaces of the electrospun 

matrices, intended to promote cells’ attachment along the scaffold; 

 (2) Soluble molecules, as growth factors, embedded in hydrogels, essential for cell growth and 

sustainability, where their release will occur mainly by bulk degradation of the material.  

  

2.2.1 Biofunctionalization of surfaces 

Osseointegration and long-term success of the implant are determined by its ability to communicate 

with surrounding biological environment. It is of major importance for an implant to be recognized by the host 

biological system and initiate the functions for which it is intended as a part of the natural process. In the design 

of a biomaterial, the surface properties should be tailored to maximize the tissue-implant reciprocity, i.e., the 

interaction of the material with proteins. For this reason, bone grafts/substitutes have received specially attention 

in surface treatments to improve surface-to-cells interaction. Currently, the most promising approach involves 

the decoration of surfaces of the implant with adhesive sequences or osteogenic growth factors, a process named 

biochemical functionalization, or bio-functionalization, where the presence of these molecules at the surface of 

the implant triggers a series of molecular processes driving cell adhesion and growth.1,41 

Activity and behaviour of osteoblasts contacting material surface, both in vitro and in vivo, are 

influenced by surface properties such as hydrophilic/hydrophobic nature of the scaffold, surface wettability, 

roughness and deformability. Many mechanical and chemical treatments, and combination of both, are thus 

performed to modify surface with opportune characteristics to optimize its biological and mechanical properties. 

ECM proteins, such as fibronectin and vitronectin, are examples of cell adhesion proteins and are known to 

promote osteoblasts adhesion, and, therefore, bone growth. The attachment of osteoblasts to the bone matrix is 

mediated by vitronectin receptor.14 In the literature is reported that the FRHRNRKGY peptide mapped on 

human vitronectin (HVP) selectively promotes osteoblast-like adhesion.42 The peptide reproducing the 351–359 

sequence of human vitronectin increases osteoblast adhesion through a specific mechanism of interaction 

between cell membrane heparin sulphate proteoglycans and heparin-binding sites of ECM proteins.43 

There are several advantages and disadvantages when using peptides instead of whole proteins. Proteins 

offer higher activity, they are well characterized molecules and are commercially available. However, the 

immobilization of an entire protein on a surface can lead to protein denaturation and loss in the bioactivity. They 



 

35 

 

are more expensive and, biologically, more immunogenic and sensitive, which make them bind with a range of 

biological ligands, losing it specificity. The immobilization of short biomimetic peptides, reproducing the 

receptor binding site of the protein, offers a convenient alternative route. When compared to proteins, peptides 

provide less activity and are poorly characterized, and there aren’t many commercialized products available. 

However, peptides can be synthesize in a cost-effective way, offering more stable molecules, with high 

specificity and less immunogenic reactions.44 Peptides can be attached to a bioactive surface either by 

physicochemical adsorption or by covalent immobilization. The first method is the simplest one but lacks 

control on the quantity and orientation of the adsorbed peptide; this disadvantage can be overcome by covalent 

binding of the selected peptide to the surface through an optimized synthetic procedure. One of the favourite 

techniques for covalent immobilization involves deposition of a silane carrying a reacting functional group that 

can be used to anchor another different molecule. Usually, a further bifunctional molecule (cross-linker or 

spacer) is subsequently added to maintain the peptide flexibility. Several authors reported the covalent 

immobilization of RGD-containing peptides on various surfaces by reaction with different silanes and cross-

linkers.43

2.3 Hydrogels  

 Hydrogels were first reported by Czech chemists Otto Wichterle and Drahoslav Lím in 1960. They 

invented polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate, the synthetic material that was later used for soft contact lenses.45 

Hydrogel products constitute a group of polymeric materials with interest to biomaterial scientists for many 

years because of their hydrophilic character and potential to be biocompatible. Hydrogels are hydrophilic 3D 

networks that are recognized by their capability to swell and retain significant amounts of water within it 

structure. During the swollen and water storage process, hydrogel’s structure can be maintained due to chemical 

or physical crosslinking of individual polymer chains. Water must constitute at least 10% of the total weight (or 

volume) for a material to be a hydrogel. Hydrogels also possess a degree of flexibility very similar to natural 

tissue due to their significant water content. The hydrophilicity of the network is due to the presence of 

hydrophilic groups attached to the polymeric backbone, such as ?NH2, ?COOH, ?OH, ?CONH2, ? CONH, and 

?SO3H, while their resistance to dissolution arise from crosslinking between network chains. Thanks to their 

notable properties such as versatility in fabrication, tuneable physical, chemical and biological characteristics, 

high biocompatibility, and similarity to living tissues, hydrogels have been widely used in 

biomedical/pharmaceutical applications.46,47 

Hydrogels are mainly formed from biopolymers and/or polyelectrolytes.46 They can be either from 

synthetic or natural polymers. Synthetic polymers that forms hydrogels are traditionally prepared using chemical 

polymerization methods. Usually they have well-defined structures that can be modified to yield tailor able 

degradability and functionality. On the other hand, natural hydrogels present long service life, high capacity of 

water absorption, and high gel strength, being the reasons for the gradually replace of the synthetic ones.8,48 One 

of the way to produce hydrogels is through the combination with molecular units, like peptides and proteins, as 

the emerging case of hydrogels from SAPs. 

 

2.4 Hydrogels from self-assembling peptides 

Peptides are very versatile building blocks for fabricating supramolecular architectures. Their ability to 

adopt specific secondary structures, as prescribed by amino acids sequence, provides a unique platform for the 

design of self-assembling biomaterials with hierarchical 3D macromolecular architectures, nanoscale features 

and tuneable physical properties.49 Peptides offer a great diversity of biochemical (specificity, intrinsic 

bioactivity, biodegradability), and physical (small size, conformation) properties to form self-assembled 

structures with different molecular configurations. Self-assembly is a spontaneous process of organization of 

chaotic molecular units into ordered structures because of intramolecular/intermolecular interactions, normally 

using processes driven by enthalpy that include Van der Waals, electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, and ?-? 

stacking interactions.50 Self-assembly involve the formation of a wide variety of complex biological structures 

such as actin filaments in the cytoskeleton, the fibrous proteins components of the ECM, DNA, among others. 



 

37 

 

These molecules can spontaneously assemble into various nanostructures in aqueous media such as fibres, tubes, 

sheets, and spheres.51  

SAPs are highly biocompatible and versatile structures. They may vary in the number of amino acids 

starting from 2 to as high as 20. Once there are the amino acids that form the building blocks, designed SAPs 

present the advantage to incorporate functional molecules on the carboxyl or amine terminal groups, opening a 

wide range of possibilities for chemical interactions and modifications. This fact, besides enhancing the design 

opportunities when compared to individual components, also leads to functional specificity, since the 

supramolecular organization of the hybrid materials is driven mainly by the bio-recognition of peptide 

segments.52,53 Self-assembling peptide systems undergo a sol-gel transition when brought to neutral pH and 

ionic concentration. These systems do not use crosslinking agents; hence, they can safely encapsulate cells 

and/or drugs without exposing them to toxic agents. Applications of SAPs as nano-biomaterials include carriers 

for drug delivery, hydrogels for cells culture, and tissue repair. Hydrogels from SAPs have a potential to serve 

as synthetic extracellular matrices. Their excellent properties can offer 3D supports for cell growth and can 

become vehicles for the delivery of stem cells, drugs or bioactive proteins. Despite the numerous advantages of 

self-assembling peptides, there are several challenges associated with their use in biomedical applications, 

which include problems related to process, control of size, functionalization, and stability in aqueous medium.10  

Zhang, S. first demonstrated the use of SAPs systems in the design of soft materials. Three types of 

SAPs have been systematically studied thus far and can be distinguished based on the final secondary molecular 

structure, that can result in ?-sheet peptide, ?-helix peptides, and peptide amphiphiles.42,43 These categories are 

numbered in type I, II and III. Type I self-assembling peptides, also known as “Molecular Lego”, are the ones 

of utmost interest for the current report. They form ?-sheet structures in aqueous solution because they contain 

two distinct surfaces, one hydrophilic and one another hydrophobic. The unique structural feature of these 

peptides is that they form complementary ionic bonds with regular repeats on the hydrophilic surface. The 

complementary ionic sides are classified according to the amino acid ionic pairing and charge distribution of 

the residues. The discovery of such a class of ionic-complementary peptides by Zhang S. was remarkable and 

caught the attention for the fields of biotechnology. The origins of the discovery date many years of investigation 

in the field of molecular biology. However, the rising interest dates back in the early 1990s when Zhang showed 

the importance of the Z-DNA, with the discovery of a Z-DNA binding protein, zuotin, in yeast. Analysis of the 

Z-DNA binding protein revealed an unusual 16-amino acid sequence (EAK 16-II) with repetitive polar and 

nonpolar residues suggesting a new class of SAPs.54 These peptides have been reported to support mammalian 

cell attachment and have been used as a scaffold for neurite outgrowth and synapse formation.55,56 

 

 

 

 



 

38 

 

2.4.1 ?-Sheet peptide 

The ?-sheet is a common motif, and second major type, of regular secondary structure in proteins. ?-

sheets consist of multiple peptide chains that have an extended backbone arrangement that permits hydrogen 

bonding between the backbone amides (?NH) and carbonyls. The interactions do not involve side chains thus 

many different sequences can form a ?-sheet, such as self-assembly of peptides into hydrogels. Although these 

interactions are relatively weak when compared to covalent bonds, they form thermodynamically stable 

structures through self-assembly due to lower values of Gibbs free energy when compared to that of the 

individual components (building blocks). Since the underlying interactions are rather weak, any external 

stimulus can alter the self-assembled structures. However, once the stimulus is removed, they can revert to their 

original structure.  

Many SAPs have been designed as ?-sheet peptides, for example, KLD?12 (Ac?(KLDL)4?NH2), 

RADA 16?I (Ac?(RARADADA)2?NH2), EAK 16?II (Ac?(AEAEAKAK)2?NH2), among others. Each of these 

oligopeptides can form a polymeric network of nanofibres rich in ?-sheet secondary structures under well-

defined conditions, for example, pH and temperature. Alanine-based sequence were the pioneering sequences 

and serve as the best model for creating hydrogel-forming systems.10,50,57 SAPs with ?-sheet structures have 

repeated alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids along a linear sequence (Figure 2.2A). This 

results in two distinct surfaces of hydrophobic and hydrophilic character. Hydrophobic interactions play an 

important role as a primary driving force for self-assembly. Electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds 

derived from hydrophilic amino acids contribute to structural specificity. The alternating hydrophobic-

hydrophilic residues assembled into sheets, where two sheets came together to bury this hydrophobic face from 

the surrounding water (Figure 2.2B). Thus, depending on the number of packed sheets, a variety of different 

hierarchical structural arrays can be designed, including tapes, ribbons, fibrils and fibres (Figure 2.2C).  

Peptides that form ?-sheets have applications in drug delivery as nanowires, nanofibres or hydrogel 

scaffolds, where the ability to encapsulate hydrophobic guest molecules between two ?-sheets enhanced their 

cell-penetration and uptake. A ?-sheet is a regular and rigid structure often represented as a series of flattened 

arrows (Figure 2B). Each arrow points towards the protein C-terminus. ?-sheets can be orientated so that all 

their C-terminus are at one end of a structure, described as a parallel structure, or so that the N and C terminus 

alternates, described as an anti-parallel structure. In both positions, the ?-strands become oriented in such a way 

that alternate amino acid side chains remains at opposite sides of the sheet. Sometimes, the electrostatic and 

hydrophobic forces among the amino acids chains stabilize the sheets.57 This has an important impact on the 

orientation of hydrogen bonds between sheets and side chain orientations and interactions.58

EAK 16-II is a typical example of “Molecular Lego” peptide that forms fibrillary assemblies at physical 

pH values. This peptide sequence is composed by a conjugation of 16 amino acids: two charged residues, 

involved in charge-charge interactions - Glutamic acid (Glu, E) with acidic properties, and Lysine (Lys, K) with 

basic properties; and one aliphatic hydrophobic residue, providing a hydrophobic environment – Alanine (Ala, 

A) (Figure 2.3). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

EAK 16 contains alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acid residues. In this conformation, 

all the hydrophobic Alanine residues side chain face in one direction. While the opposite polar face is composed 

by Glutamic acid and Lysine residues, negatively and positively charged, respectively. This conformation 

creates two distinct faces. When protonated, the amine groups of the Lysine residues will link with the 

carboxylic groups present in the Glutamic acid residue through ionic complementarity. On the other hand, the 

nonpolar side chain establishes hydrophobic interactions, Figure 2.4. This repetitive anti-parallel arrangement

of amino acids imparts an amphiphilic property to the peptide. Instead of exhibiting a hydrophobic tail and a 

hydrophilic head like usual surfactants, EAK 16 has a hydrophobic side and a hydrophilic side. This peptide 

turns out to form unusual stable form ?-sheets and further stable membrane-like structures upon an addition of 

salts in solution.56 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Upon the introduction of milli molar amounts of monovalent cations (such as Na+, Cs+), either through 

the addition of salt solution, cell culture media or injection of the material in vivo, EAK 16-II undergoes self-

assembly into nanofibres, ~10 nm in diameter, on a scale like the in vivo ECM. EAK 16?II can form a 

macroscopic nano-fibrous membrane resistant to high temperatures, extreme pH values as well as chemical 

denaturants. The resulting EAK 16?II hydrogel exhibits the ability to foster mammalian cell attachment.59 The 

physical size relative to cells and proteins, the amphiphilic peptide’s charge density, and water-structuring 

abilities mimic the in vivo ECM as well. These well-ordered nanofibres create 3D porous scaffolds that are very 

difficult or impossible to synthetically produce by other manufacturing techniques. Comparing to Matrigel™, 

these scaffolds have been shown to be more effective in promoting the bone regeneration of calvaria bone 

defects in mice.60 The nanofibre density and average pore size, ~5?200 nm, correlates with the concentration of 

peptide solution that is used to produce the material, which can be varied from 0.1 to 3% in water (1?30 w/v 

(%)) depending on the application. EAK 16-II not only can be used as a coating or to encapsulate cells similar 

to the ECM, but can also be tailor-made for particular cells, tissues and therapies.61

2.5 Electrospinning and Nanofibres  

Fibres are defined, from a geometrical standpoint, as a slender, elongated threadlike object or structure. 

Joining this term with the prefix “nano” it can be easily perceptible that the word nanofibres stands for fibres 

whose fabrication technology in which they are designed and built, by the specification and placement of 

individual atoms or molecules, has, at least, one dimension on a scale of nanometers.62 

Electrospinning is a cost-effective attractive technique to synthesize nanofibres from various 

biodegradable polymers due to the simplicity of the technique, ability to effectively control the process, and 

potential for scale-up production.32 Although electrospinning has just became a topic of interest to produce 

polymeric nanofibres in the lately years, it was observed more than one century ago by Rayleigh (1897) and 

firstly patented by Formhals (1934). The main advantages of electrospinning is it capability to produce long and 

continuous fibres with micro- and nano-diameters, and their ability to be manipulated to form 3D structures 

during deposition.33,63  

 

2.5.1 Electrospinning Process 

The most basic electrospinning setup consists of three major components: a high voltage power supply, 

an electrically conducting spinneret and a collector separated at a defined distance, Figure 2.5.64 The most 

common setup used in laboratory comprise a syringe that holds the polymer solution with a blunt tip needle as 

spinneret. The solution can be fed at a constant and controllable rate using the syringe pump.7 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Electrospinning is a process of creating nanofibres and/or microfibres through the action of an external 

electric field imposed on a liquid polymer solution. The polymer solutions can be either from natural or synthetic 

polymers.7,64 When a high voltage (typically in the range of 5-30 kV) is applied to a polymer, the surface of the 

Figure 2.5 Basic electrospinning setup (adapted from D. Li and Y. Xia, Adv. Mater. Weinheim, Ger. 16, 1151, 

2004).64 



 

42 

 

fluid droplet held by its own surface tension gets electrostatically charged at the spinneret tip. When charges 

within the fluid reaches a critical amount, a fluid jet will erupt from the droplet at the tip of the needle resulting 

in the formation of a Taylor cone, see Figure 6, and a fine jet ejects from its surface toward the collection plate.  

Electrospinning process comprises three stages: jet initiation, jet elongation and jet solidification.64 The 

jet initiation stage is characterized by the formation of the already referred “Taylor Cone”. The conical surface 

is due to the application of the electric field, inducing a charge on the surface of the drop. This charge offsets 

the forces of surface tension and the droplet changes shape from spherical to conical. When the intensity of the 

electric field attains an adequate value, the electrostatic forces overcome the surface tension of the polymer 

solution and force the ejection of the liquid jet from the tip of the Taylor cone. The electrospinning jet will travel 

towards the region of lower potential which, in most cases, is a grounded collector. Along this drive, elongation 

stage occurs. Before reaching the collector screen, the liquid jet elongates, and the solvent evaporates, leading 

to the formation of a randomly oriented, non-woven mat of thin polymeric fibres on the collector. The liquid jet 

is electrically charged, and the charge causes the fibres to bend in such a way that every time the polymer fibre 

loops, its diameter is reduced, Figure 2.6. This fact, known as bending instability, is due to the shifts in the 

balance between surface tension and electrical forces, and changes in the jet trajectory. Initially, the solution jet 

follows a linear trajectory but, at some critical distance from the spinneret orifice, the jet begins to whip out, 

and starts following a diverging helical path. The repulsive forces between the charges carried with the jet, 

elongate the jet in the direction of its axis until it solidifies.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 2.6 Diagram showing onset and development of bending instabilities (adapted from D. H. Reneker and 

H. Fong, Polymeric Nanofibres, American Chemical Society, Washington DC, 2005).64 



 

43 

 

The solidification of the jet results in the deposition of a dry nanofibre on the collector. The 

solidification rate varies with the polymer concentration, electrostatic field and gap distance. With the 

evaporation of the solvent and posterior solidification of the fluid jet, it is normally observed a mass decrease 

and a volume variation. This stage is characterized by strong attachments at crossing points that hence stiffen 

the mat. This is an important factor since it determines the mechanical properties of the structure. After the onset 

of bending instability, the jet path may follow a very complicated path, and successive loops of coil may touch 

in flight and form permanent connections, Figure 2.7.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 There are many parameters that will influence the morphology of the resultant electrospun fibres from 

beaded fibres to fibres with pores on its surface. Performing electrospinning comprises the understanding of 

several features which will directly influence that resulting fibre morphology. These features are usually related 

to the working conditions in which the technique is undertaken.  

 

2.5.2 Effects of working parameters on electrospinning 

 Working parameters are very important to understand not only the nature of electrospinning but also 

the conversion of polymer solutions into nanofibres through electrospinning. The parameters affecting 

electrospinning and the fibres may be broadly classified into polymer solution parameters, processing conditions 

which include the applied voltage, temperature, and effect of collector, and ambient conditions. Each of these 

parameters can affect the fibres morphologies, and by proper control of these parameters we can fabricate 

electrospun fibres with desired morphologies and diameters.62 

 

A. Polymer Solution Parameters 

i. Concentration 

The polymers concentration is an important parameter in the solution aspects because it affects both 

surface tension and viscosity of the solution, and the deposition area. For very low concentration, polymeric 

micro- and nanoparticles will be obtained. At this point, electrospray occurs instead of electrospinning because 

the low entanglement of polymer chains cannot withstand the electrostatic charge. As the concentration is 

gradually increased, a mixture of beads and thin fibres will be formed along the fibre axis. When the 

Figure 2.7 A diagram of a loop in a segment of one fibre and another loop (adapted from Reneker et al., 

Polymer 43, 6785, 2002).64 



 

44 

 

concentration is suitable, smooth and more uniform nanoFibres can be obtained. If the concentration is too high, 

the fibre formation will not occur.9 

 

ii. Molecular Weight and Solution Viscosity 

The molecular weight of the polymer represents the length of the polymer chain, which in turn influence 

the viscosity of the solution. One of the conditions necessary for electrospinning to occur where fibres are 

formed is that the solution must consists of polymer of sufficient molecular weight and the solution must be of 

sufficient viscosity. As the jet leaves the needle tip during electrospinning, the polymer solution is stretched as 

it travels towards the collection plate. During the stretching of the polymer solution, it is the entanglement of 

the molecule chains that prevents the electrically driven jet from breaking up thus maintaining a continuous  

solution jet. As a result, monomeric polymer solution does not form fibres when electrospun.65 Keeping the 

concentration fixed and lowering the molecular weight of the polymer tends to form beads rather than smooth 

fibres. Increasing the molecular weight, smooth fibres will be obtained. When the viscosity of the solution is 

too low, electro-spraying may occur. A way to increase the viscosity of the solution is to increase the polymer 

concentration. During electrospinning, there may be secondary jet erupting from the main electrospinning jet 

which is stable enough to yield fibres of smaller diameter at certain viscosity. This may explain the differential 

fibre diameter distribution observed in some cases. However, when the viscosity is high enough, it may 

discourage secondary jets from breaking off from the main jet which may contribute to the increased fibre 

diameter.7 

 

iii. Surface Tension 

The initiation of electrospinning requires the charged solution to overcome its surface tension. The jet 

stretching already reported is caused by the influence of solution surface tension in the drops and, consequently, 

the cause of fibres formation. As the jet travels towards the collection plate, the surface tension may cause the 

formation of beads along the jet. Surface tension has the effect of decreasing the surface area per unit mass of a 

fluid and is directly affected by the temperature. For a pure liquid system, the surface tension of the liquid would 

decrease with increasing temperature.33,66  

 

iv. Polymer Solubility 

The structure of the polymer has an impact on its solubility in the solvent. Generally, a polymer with 

higher molecular weight is less soluble and takes much longer to dissolve than one with a lower molecular 

weight using the same solvent. Crystallinity of the polymer measures the degree of orderliness of the polymer 

chain packed within the bulk. Polymers of higher crystallinity has lower solubility as the solvent molecules have 

difficulty in penetrating the interior of the polymer bulk.62,67 

  

 

 



 

45 

 

v. Volatility (Evaporation) of the solution 

 The type of solvent is important to determine the ability of fibre forming. When most of the solvents 

have evaporated when the jet reaches the collector, individual fibres are formed. If the ejected fibres are 

collected before the complete evaporation of the solvent, the fibres will either flatten or adhere to other fibres 

causing interconnected network of fibres. Moreover, if the rate of evaporation of the solvent is too low such that 

the solution has not evaporated sufficiently when the electrospinning jet reaches the collector, fibres may not 

be formed at all, and a thin film of polymer solution are deposited on the collector. The evaporation rate of a 

solvent is dependent on many factors: vapour pressure, boiling point, specific heat, enthalpy and heat of 

vaporization of the solvent, rate of heat supply, interaction between solvent molecules and between solvent and 

solute molecules, surface tension of liquid, and air movement above the liquid surface.9,62 

 

B. Processing Conditions 

i. Voltage 

A crucial element in electrospinning is the application of a high voltage (HV) to the solution. The high 

voltage will induce the necessary charges on the solution and together with the external electric field, will initiate 

the electrospinning process. Generally, both high negative or positive voltage of more than 6kV can cause the 

solution drop at the tip of the needle. Depending on the feed rate of the solution, a higher voltage may be required 

so that the Taylor Cone is stable. In most cases, a higher voltage will lead a reducing in the diameter of the 

fibres and encourage faster solvent evaporation to yield drier fibres. The effect of high voltage is not only on 

the physical appearance of the fibre, it also affects the crystallinity of the polymer. The electrostatic field may 

cause the polymer molecules to be more ordered during electrospinning, thus inducing a greater crystallinity in 

the fibre. Another factor that may influence the diameter of the fibre is the flight time of the electrospinning jet. 

A longer flight time will allow more time for the fibres to stretch and elongates before it is deposited on the 

collection plate. Thus, at a lower voltage, the reduced acceleration of the jet and the weaker electric field may 

increase the flight time of the electrospinning jet which may favour the formation of finer fibres. Both AC and 

DC voltage supply can be used in electrospinning, although DC is more commonly used.62 

 

ii. Feed rate 

The feed rate will determine the amount of solution available for electrospinning. For a given voltage, 

there is a corresponding feed rate if a stable Taylor Cone is maintained. When the feed rate is increased, there 

is a corresponding increase in the fibre diameter or beads size, Figure 2.8.9  

 

iii. Effect of Collector 

The collector plate is made of conductive material such as aluminium foil which is electrically grounded 

so that there is a stable potential difference between the source and the collector. In the case when a non-

conducting material is used as a collector, charges on the electrospinning jet will quickly accumulate on the 

collector which will result in fewer fibres deposited with lower packing density compared to those collected on 



 

46 

 

a conducting surface. For a conducting collector, charges on the fibres are dissipated thus allowing more fibres 

to be attracted to the collector.62  

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

iv. Nozzle (needle) diameter 

A smaller internal diameter of the needle was found to reduce the clogging as well as the number of 

beads on the electrospun fibres. The reduction in the clogging could be due to less exposure of the solution to 

the atmosphere during electrospinning. Decrease in the internal diameter of the orifice causes a reduction in the 

diameter of the electrospun fibres. In any case, if the diameter of the orifice is too small, it may not be possible 

to extrude a droplet of solution at its tip.62 

 

v. Distance between Tip and Collector 

Varying the distance between the tip and the collector will have a direct influence in both the flight time 

and the electric field strength. Increasing collecting distance cause fibre diameter decrease as the jet will have a 

longer distance to travel. It gives enough time for the solvents to evaporate before reaching the collector. When 

the distance is too low, excess solvent may cause the fibres to merge where they contact to form junctions 

resulting in inter and intra layer bonding, Figure 2.9. This interconnected fibre mesh may provide additional 

strength to the resultant scaffold.9

al., 1999).62 

 



 

47 

 

C. Ambient Parameters 

i. Humidity 

The humidity of the environment determines the rate of evaporation of the solvent in the solution. There 

are no ideal values for humidity to improve the morphology of the fibres. However, at a very low humidity, a 

volatile solvent may dry rapidly.62  

 

ii. Type of Atmosphere  

Different gases have different behaviour under high electrostatic field. For example, helium will break 

down under high electrostatic field and thus electrospinning is not possible. When gas with higher breakdown 

voltage is used, the fibres obtained have twice the diameter of those electrospun in air, given all other conditions 

equal.62 

 

iii. Pressure 

Generally, reduction in the pressure surrounding the electrospinning jet does not improve the process. 

When the pressure is below atmospheric pressure, the polymer solution in the syringe will have a greater 

tendency to flow out of the needle and there cause unstable jet initiation. As the pressure decreases, rapid 

bubbling of the solution will occur at the needle tip. At very low pressure, electrospinning is not possible due 

to direct discharge of the electrical charges.62  

 

2.5.3 Properties of electrospun nanofibres   

A. Porosity 

 For a variety of applications, porous fibre surfaces are desired. In electrospun nanofibres, two types of 

pores can be identified: pores on/within each fibre and pores between the fibres of a nanofibrous membrane.  A 

high density of pores can be formed due to the entanglement of fibres. When compared to mesoporous materials 

(e.g., molecular sieves), the specific surface area of the electrospun fibres is lower, but the pores are relatively 

large and fully interconnected to form a 3D network. The knowledge of pore size and porosity is essential in 

determining the membrane’s performance. Pore size determines the type of substance or species that can 

permeate through, whereas porosity is a measure of the flow across the membrane.64,68  

 

B. Surface structure 

 The surface of electrospun fibres is generally smooth. The use of low concentration solution or high 

electrical potential produces beaded electrospun structures that are considerably rougher than completely fibrous 

structures, Figure 2.10. The cross-sectional shape of electrospun fibres is usually circular. However, in some 

cases, a skin forms on the polymeric jet and then collapses into a ribbon as the solvent evaporates. This results 

in flattened nanofibres, which are created with high molecular weight polymers and high polymer concentration. 

The solvent evaporation reduces with higher solution viscosity, resulting in wet fibres that reach the collector 



 

48 

 

and are flattened by the impact. The flat ribbon shape can be attributed to the collapse of an outer skin formed 

on the surface of the jet.64  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

C. Chain conformation and crystallinity 

 Due to rapid stretching of the electrified jet and the rapid evaporation of the solvent, the polymer chains 

are expected to experience an extremely strong shear force during the electrospinning process. This rapid 

stretching and solidification can prevent the polymer chains from relaxing back to their equilibrium 

conformations. As a result, more molecular orientation is found. The rapid stretching and solidification of the 

polymer chains lead to another important effect, the retardation of the crystallization process. The time is not 

enough for stretched chains to crystallize. Although the polymer chains are noncrystalline in the nanofibres, 

they are highly oriented. Thus, the defects in crystallization are minimal.64

2.6 Potential of electrospun PCL fibre mats for biomedical applications 

 

Poly (?-caprolactone), (PCL) or simply polycaprolactone is a hydrophobic semi-crystalline polymer. Its 

biodegradability, biocompatibility, chemical and thermal stability, and good mechanical properties present the 

viability in the usage of this polyester in the emerging field of biomedical applications. 9,69 Biodegradable 

synthetic polymers as PCL are widely used as scaffolds for TE. The electrospun PCL fibre mats act as temporary 

substrates for promoting adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of various types of cultured cells, carriers 

for biological agents, and wound decreasing materials.6 PCL is synthetized by ring opening polymerization of 

the cyclic monomer ?-caprolactone, using various anionic, cationic and co-ordination catalysts.  

The good solubility and blend compatibility of PCL has been making it useful in biomedical 

applications. Because PCL can be degraded in slower rate than other polymers such as polyglycolide, poly D,L-

lactide and its copolymers, thus it is suitable for use in applications that require slow degradation. PCL can be 

blended and modified with other polymers to improve its physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. 

Moreover, it is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in humans.69 In addition, PCL can be 

formed as continuous ultrafine fibres by electrospinning to give excellent characteristics such as high porosity 

and surface area.9 The degradation of PCL nanofibres has received a great deal of attention when used as an 

implantable biomaterial. PCL can be degraded by hydrolysis of its ester linkages in physiological conditions 

(such as in the human body).69 Biodegradability of PCL is important; thus, the sub-products of degradation 

could not evoke any inflammatory reaction. Depending on the molecular weight, PCL as a homopolymer has 

degradation times ranging from 2 to 4 years. As a semi-crystalline material, the degradation initiates in the 

amorphous regions. When the amorphous phases are fully degraded, it results in a highly crystalline but with 

low molecular weight polymer. Water molecules will permeate further into the implant. Further degradation of 

the crystalline phase is carried out by cellular activity, and will result in fragmentation and decreased mechanical 

properties.41,70  

The hydrophobic nature of PCL limits protein absorption and consequently cell attachment. To improve 

the hemocompatibility and endothelization of PCL nanofibres, usually the polymer surface is submitted to a 

chemical modification. This should enhance the subsequent immobilization of various bioactive substances.71,72 

Several approaches have been developed to modify polymer surfaces, such as plasma modification, wet 

chemical method, surface graft polymerization, blending of synthetic polymers with natural ones, or physical 

adsorption of proteins.73,74

3.2 Methods 

 3.2.1 Fmoc - Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis 

Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) was introduced by Bruce Merrifield in 1959 and has now become 

the method of choice to produce peptides because of the facility to obtain the final product rapidly and in a less 

expensive way. Solid-phase is a powerful strategy for multi-step reactions and it means that the desired molecule 

will be synthesized on the surface of a solid polymeric support. It changed the strategy of peptide synthesis by 

allowing the isolation of the intended products out of each step and simplifying the tedious and demanding steps 

of purification associated with solution phase synthesis. Moreover, it permitted the development of automation 

and the extensive range of robotic instrumentation, saving lots of time during the procedure and dramatically 

improving the yields of product. In SPPS two main strategies are used: the Boc/Bzl and the Fmoc/tBu approaches 

for N-terminal/side chain protecting groups. In this work, the focus is the Fmoc strategy for SPPS. The Fmoc/tBu 

method is based upon an orthogonal protecting group strategy.75  

SPPS is performed from the C-terminus to the N-terminus of the peptide (opposite to direction in nature) 

with the introduction of N?-protected amino acids. In Fmoc-SPPS, the peptide chain is assembled stepwise, one 

amino acid at a time, while attached to an insoluble resin support. Amino acids are protected at their amino 

terminus by the Fmoc group. Fmoc is a special protecting group which is used to protect amine functional 

groups from reacting. This approach uses the base-labile Fmoc group for protection of the ?-amino function 

from the acid-labile linkers that constitute the C-terminal amino acid protecting group. This amino group acts 

as a linker in the amino acids coupling reactions and is responsible for the activation reaction between the first 

amino acid and the resin. Before every coupling reaction, the amino acid needs to be Fmoc-de-protected, 

resulting in a free amine group available for coupling. The amino acids coupling reaction, and the consequent 

chain grow, occurs after activation of the carboxylic acid terminus. This procedure is repeated doing n-de-

protections and n-couplings during n-cycles until the desired sequence is complete. Once chain elaboration is 

accomplished, the final Fmoc should be equally removed and the N-terminus can be either left as a free amine 

or it can be capped with a subtle group. The peptide is then cleaved from the resin and side chain protections 

are removed. In this synthesis, a process of washing and filtration of the sample is performed at the end of each 

step. Thus, excess of reagents, solvents, and any other compounds not bound to the resin are removed. This 

procedure can prevent unwanted reactions, allowing higher yields, and producing cleaner synthesis.76 Figure 

3.1 summarizes the SPPS method. 

 

i. Solid support 

 The solid support is a plastic polymer functionalized with a linker molecule. These are often referred to 

as resins. The resin is an insoluble and inert support. The function of the linkers is to link the peptide to the resin 

during SPPS. The linker also defines the C-terminal functional groups that can be either an acidic or an amidic 

group, formed, respectively, via an ester or an amide bond. For the synthesis of C-terminal peptide amides the 



 

54 

 

commonly used resins are Rink amide resin, Pal resin, and Sieber resin. These resins are compatible with Fmoc 

chemistry and final acidic cleavage. These resins are usually Fmoc-protected and should be deprotected before 

incorporation of the first residue.77  

 

 

 

ii.  Solvents 

 Prior to beginning a synthesis, the resin should be swelled in the synthesis solvent. The most common 

solvents for Fmoc-SPPS are dimethylformamide (DMF) or N-methylpyrolidone (NMP). Swelling the resins 

allows them to expand and maximize the exposure of their functional groups to the incoming reactants. NMP  

and DMF are common used solvents. They efficiently solvate the resin and, in many cases, improves coupling

55 

 

yield. Most common peptide reagents are very soluble in NMP; however, DMF is cheaper that NMP, so it is 

more frequently used even despite its tendency to release reactive amines. 

iii. Fmoc-deprotection and Piperidine test 

Fmoc is stable in acidic conditions but it is easily removed by a weak base. Typically, piperidine is used 

as the base for this de-protection reaction. The result is an unprotected or free amine which can undergo a 

coupling reaction with the carbonyl of the next amino acid. Fmoc de-protection is a very critical step since it 

determines the yield and quality of reaction due to deleted residues and even capped peptides. Fmoc group 

removal in SPPS proceeds through a two-step mechanism, where the unprotected amino acids, or resin, are 

protonated resulting in the final product with a free -NH2 group. The first step is the removal of the acidic proton 

at the 9-position of the fluorene ring system by a mild base, preferably a secondary amine, like piperidine. The 

use of cyclic secondary amines is more convenient due to their nucleophilicity (capacity to attack any other 

atom than hydrogen). The second step is the subsequent ?-elimination that yields a highly reactive 

dibenzofulvene (DBF) intermediate which is immediately trapped by the secondary amine to form stable 

adducts, Figure 3.2. This step occurs with the formation of CO2. These reactions work better in an electron 

donor and relative polar medium, such as DMF.78 To ensure the correct coupling of the first amino acid, a 

piperidine test is performed. This test is also known as resin functionalization test and is used to quantify the 

functionalization of the resin with the first amino acid. Fmoc removal can be monitored by UV spectroscopy. 

The de-protection results in formation of a DBF-piperidine adduct that strongly absorbs in the UV range. This 

is a common procedure with automatic synthesizers. The piperidine test must result in a functionalization of, at 

least, 98%.

56 

 

iv. Carboxylic activation and coupling reagents 

The activation reaction involves the binding of the carboxyl terminal of the amino acid to the solid 

support, and to the consequent amino acids. The carboxylate here is not very reactive, thus the carbonyl needs 

to be activated. The activation of the carboxylic group passes through making it more electrophilic. Normally, 

this step is performed using the coupling reagents promoting the activation in situ. Coupling reagents activate 

the carbonyl group for substitutions by converting the anionic oxygen into an acceptable leaving group. The 

carboxylic activation is described as an acceleration of carbodiimide-mediated couplings, a suppression of 

racemization and an inhibition of dehydration of the carboxamide side chains. In other words, it is the chemical 

process responsible to remove the carboxylic group present in the amino acid nomenclature and to form an 

amidic group, sustaining the chirality of the molecule. Activation occurs very rapidly in DMF. Excellent results 

have been obtained for Fmoc-SPPS using the activating reagent HBTU combined with HOBt, in the presence 

of a base such as the tertiary amine DIPEA. HATU is also typically used in cases of difficult coupling reactions 

and its rather combined with Oxyma Pure.79  

 

v. Kaiser test (ninhydrin test)  

The Kaiser test is a quantitative and very sensitive test where it uses ninhydrin to detect the presence or 

absence of free primary amino groups. It is a widespread colorimetric assay commonly used in SPPS to monitor 

the N-terminus de-protection, to determine if coupling reactions are complete, and gives the overall yield of the 

reaction. This test is responsible to determine the percentage of free amine groups present in the synthesis, i.e., 

the amine groups that didn’t react with the C-terminus of the following amino acid, resulting in short chains of 

peptide. Ninhydrin reacts with the de-protected N-terminal amine group of the peptide-resin. Ninhydrin is a 

white solid which is soluble in ethanol and acetone at room temperature. When reacting with free amines, a 

deep blue or purple colour known as Ruhemann's purple is produced, Figure 3.3. However, when amino acids 

residues are attached with their N-terminus protected, so if the next residue has been successfully coupled onto 

the chain, the test gives as colourless or yellow result.80 Depending on the colour obtained the synthesis can 

either proceed or undergo the repetition of some previous steps. The actions followed according to the obtained 

colour are described in the table 1. In the end, the yield of reaction needs to be more than 97% to assume 

completion of the coupling reaction and for the synthesis to proceed.

vi. Side chain protecting groups 

In the Fmoc strategy, it is important that the side chain protecting groups are not sensitive to base, so 

that these groups remain on the side chains throughout all coupling steps and do not fall off during the piperidine 

de-protection steps. Some of the most commonly used side-chain protecting groups are Boc and OtBu. Both 

aren’t reactive with piperidine and can be removed under acidic conditions, commonly using TFA, at the final 

cleavage of the peptidyl-resin linkage. Both permanent and temporary protector will ensure the reaction of 

Fmoc-amino acids, only in the site of interest for the formation of the peptide bond. It helps to prevent secondary 

reactions, such as the incorporation of dipeptides derivatives instead of an amino acid derivative. In addition, it 

may help in the final purification of the product due to reduced number of undesired products.75  

 

vii. Final De-protection and Cleavage 

After performing the coupling of all amino acids of the peptide sequence, the synthesis proceeds to 

peptide cleavage. Peptide cleavage consists in the separation of the peptide from the resin and in the removal of 

the side chain protecting groups and, thus, in obtaining the desired peptide, free of any protecting groups or 

structural modification. When using the orthogonal protection Fmoc/tBu strategy, the peptidyl-resin linkage and 

the side chain protecting groups are removed in an acidic environment, normally using TFA. The process of 

deprotection in an acid environment can, however, generate highly reactive species (e.g. carbocations). These 

carbocations are very reactive electrophilic species, capable of reacting with some side chains with nucleophilic 

characteristics, causing covalent modifications of some amino acid residues. The use of nucleophilic reagents, 

called scavengers (reactive with properties like those of the species to be protected), together with TFA during 

Figure 3.3 Mechanism describing the reaction of ninhydrin with free amines, resulting in the formation of the 

Ruhemann’s Purple compound (adapted).80 



 

58 

 

the release, allows to significantly reduce unwanted side reactions. The cleavage is then performed using the 

so-called cleavage cocktail. The cocktail consists in a mixture of a solution composed mainly by TFA and 

appropriated scavengers such as water, trialkylsilanes, thiols. The choice of the release mixture, the type of 

scavengers and the time required by the de-protection, depend on the amino acid sequence, and on the nature 

and number of the protecting groups used in the side chain. Cleavage reactions typically take 0.5 to 3 hours 

depending on the linkers and protecting groups used. After the cleavage reaction, the cleavage solution is filtered 

from the resin and the peptide is obtained by precipitation with ice-cold ether. Peptides should be washed at 

least 3 times with ice-cold ether following precipitation to remove the scavengers as much as possible. 

Afterwards, peptides may be left in a hood to air-dry overnight, or lyophilized for storage.75 

 

3.2.2 Peptide purification and chromatographic characterization  

The crude peptide obtained from stepwise SPPS will often contain a variety of by-products in addition 

to the desired product. These products include peptides containing deletion or addition sequences generated 

during the synthesis itself and a series of peptides containing chemical modifications usually generated during 

the cleavage and de-protection steps. Crude peptides of less than 30 residues can be expected to be between 80-

95% target peptide, all that is required is an effective purification protocol, where the other components can be 

successfully removed. In general, mostly of the peptides fewer than 50 residues in length can be purified using 

Reversed Phase - High Performance Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC). RP-HPLC is the most widely used 

analytical technique for the separation, identification and quantification of organic compounds in mixtures, such 

as biomedical samples. HPLC can be performed with or without prior clean-up steps, although time-consuming 

clean-up and fractioning steps are crucial to its success.82 Molecules that possess some degree of hydrophobic 

character, such as proteins and peptides, can be separated by RP-HPLC with excellent recovery due to its high 

resolution. 

 

i. Components of a basic RP-HPLC 

A basic RP-HPLC system comprises the following components: a reservoir, a high-pressure pump, an 

injector, a column, and a detector, Figure 3.4. The reservoir is responsible to hold the solvent, called the mobile 

phase. The motion of the solvent is generated using a high-pressure pump that also serves to determine it specific 

flow rate. The sample is injected into the continuously flowing mobile phase stream by the injector, carrying 

the sample into the HPLC column. The column contains the chromatographic packing material needed to affect 

the separation. This packing material is called the stationary phase because it is held in place by the column 

hardware. A detector is needed to see the separated compound bands as they elute from the HPLC column. 

Commonly, UV detector with fixed or variable wavelength is used for liquid chromatographic analysis. The 

mobile phase exits the detector and can be sent to waste, or collected, as desired.83 



 

59 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ii. Mechanism of protein/peptide retention 

The retention mechanism in reversed phase chromatography depends on the hydrophobic binding 

interaction between the solute molecule in the mobile phase and the immobilized hydrophobic ligand, i.e. the 

stationary phase. Proteins and peptides possess some degree of hydrophobicity that allows them to be adsorbed 

by the stationary phase, Figure 3.5. The net interaction caused by this hydrophobic adsorption is very strong 

resulting in the protein remaining adsorbed to the surface. Much of the proteins are large when compared to the 

thickness of the hydrophobic surface. This makes them to lie above the surface and be permanently in contact 

with the mobile phase. The mobile phase constitutes the organic solvent. At a specific concentration of the 

solvent, proteins are desorbed from the surface and elutes from the column. The amount of organic solvent is 

unique to each protein. Elution can proceed either by isocratic conditions where the concentration of organic 

solvent is constant, or by gradient elution whereby the amount or organic solvent is increased over time. In this 

last case, a gradual increase in the concentration of organic solvent compared to water increases the 

hydrophobicity of the mobile phase and determines the competition between it and the stationary phase, 

resulting in a loss of the analyte.84 Separation is accomplished by the single adsorption/desorption process, 

although there is some interaction with the surface as the protein moves down the column. The sample should 

ideally be dissolved in the initial mobile phase in a way to provide a reproducible and homogeneous solution. 

This solution must be relatively free of interferences to do not cause any damage in the column and be prepared 

accordingly to the solvent system that will be employed.

iii. Column characteristics 

The column is selected depending on the nature of the solute and the information about the analyte.  

Proteins and peptides are separated by interacting with the hydrophobic surface of particles packed in columns. 

The particles in the column are usually made of silica because silica is physically robust, it is stable under most 

solvent conditions (except at pH greater than 6.5), and can be made into spherical particles of various sizes with 

pores of different diameters. The silica is modified with a hydrocarbon molecule to create a hydrophobic surface. 

A C8 or C18 column made from specially purified, less acidic silica, and designed specifically for the separation 

of basic compounds is generally suitable for all samples and is strongly recommended. Columns with 5 ?m 

particle size give the best compromise of efficiency, reproducibility, and reliability. Using small pore diameter 

(~100 Å) silica results in inferior proteins separations. Wide pore silica diameter (~300 Å) gives much better 

separation of proteins. The interaction between column and proteins/peptides occurs near the top of the column, 

thus, columns length is not important in protein separations.85 

 

iv. Mobile phase 

The mobile phase usually contains strong acids at low pH with large concentrations of organic solvent. 

The most popular organic modifier employed for separating peptides is acetonitrile. This solvent is essentially 

UV transparent. Most peptides only absorb at low wavelengths in the UV spectrum (typically less than 225 nm), 

and acetonitrile provides much lower background absorbance that other common solvents at low wavelengths. 

Acetonitrile is also used because it is volatile and it can be easily removed from the sample. The RP 

chromatography of proteins and peptides requires a reagent, called an “ion-pair”, added to the mobile phase 

intended to achieve good peak shape. It is believed that metal impurities on the silica surface are responsible for 

poor protein/peptide peak shape in the absence if an ion-pair reagent. The most commonly used ion-pair reagent 

is TFA. The TFA concentration may affect peptide selectivity. TFA added to the mobile phase at a concentration 

of ~0.1% results in good peak shape on most columns.85

3.2.3 Plasma polymer deposition through Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Jet (APPJ) 

Specialists define plasma as “partially or completely ionized gas that comprises free electrons, ions, 

radicals and atoms or molecules of non-ionized neutral gas”. Plasma deposition, also known as plasma 

activation or plasma functionalization, is a method employed for modifying or coating surfaces, aiming to 

improve the adhesion properties of the material. Plasma deposition has applications for the modification of 

surfaces, depositions of thin films, sterilization, or surface modification of polymer fibres, with utility in the 

biomedical, environmental, and technological fields. The goal of surface functionalization is to deposit chemical 

functionalities, independently of the substrate, to promote linkage with other substances added in a second 

moment, such as biomolecules. Amongst the several plasma modification techniques, Atmospheric Pressure 

Plasmas (APPs) are one of the most preferred techniques. APP treatments do not require complex and expensive 

vacuum systems and have shorter processing time.  

The working principle of APPJ is based on the ionization of a gas through an electrical discharge. The 

present work used the method and device described in the patent U.S. Pat. No. 2016/0295676 by Patelli et al., 

for generating plasma at atmospheric-pressure and under low-temperatures conditions. Low-pressure and low-

temperature plasmas benefit the process of surface coating because they generate high concentrations of reactive 

species that can etch, and deposit thin films, and the thermally sensitive substrates are not damaged. This device 

is intended for treating surfaces and for deposition of surface coating by means of the introduction of a precursor 

in a channel situated inside and coaxial with respect to the duct with the plasma. This device comprises: a first 

pair of electrodes, each of which separated by a dielectric layer, arranged in a way that connects to a High-

Frequency (HF) power supply, and externally positioned with respect to a tubular duct where the gas flows; a 

second pair of electrodes equally separated by a dielectric layer, arranged to connect with a Radio-Frequency 

(RF) power supply and with respect to said tubular duct where the same gas flows downstream with respect to 

the first pair and the direction of the flow. A HF excitation is applied to the first pair of electrodes. RF excitation 

is applied to the second pair of electrodes. The coupling of a HF power supply with RF power supply, and the 

possibility to operate with pulse trains is designed to obtain cold and self-sustained plasma in a wide range of 

work conditions and mixtures. The filamentary plasma generated in this manner emerges from the gas flow at 

the outlet of the transport duct, Figure 3.6. Filamentary plasma is a result of an applied electric field that is 

greater than the strike voltage, to the gas. This produces electrons’ acceleration, causing avalanche ionization 

along the direction of the electric field itself, forming a filament that then dies out. Helium, hydrogen, neon, 

nitrogen, argon, oxygen or mixtures thereof can be used as operating gas in any ratio, resulting in a wide array 

of chemically active species in the plasma. These species can be either organic, inorganic, nano-composites, 

among others. Chemical precursors and reagents can be added to the plasma as vapours or aerosols.86

3.2.4 Chemo-selective ligation 

 Chemo-selective ligation is a term employed to describe a site-specific modification to facilitate the 

assembly of biomolecules. Often presented as chemical bio-conjugation, or simply bio-conjugation, chemo-

selective ligation is the process of linking or connecting a biological molecule with another moiety under mild 

aqueous conditions. These moieties may include other biomolecules, synthetic polymers, and small molecules 

such as ligands, drugs, or fluorescent dyes, among others.  

Bio-conjugation can happen through multiple chemical reactions. The choice of method of conjugation 

depends on the native functional groups presented in the target biomolecules. These groups are the primary sites 

for bio-conjugation and are generally nucleophiles or electrophiles. The most typical methods in chemo-

selective ligation are the reaction of an amino group with activated carboxylic acids, isothiocynates, and 

carbonyls, such as ketones or aldehydes, although aldehydes are substantially more reactive than ketones, 

followed by in situ reductive amination.87,88 Primary amines groups (R-NH2) are one of the most common 

nucleophiles in biomolecules, and represent an ubiquitous key functional group found in many biological 

systems, such as in free amino acids. The reaction between an amine and a carbonyl is highly chemo-selective 

and is compatible with other functional groups present in biomolecules. Primary amines will spontaneously 

react with aldehydes and ketones to form imines, also known as Schiff bases, Figure 3.7 a). The resulting imine 

bond is covalent but reversible, and both its stability and dynamics strongly depend on the nature of the amine 

and the carbonyl. To address this shortcoming, reductive amination is usually carried out either as one-pot or 

two-step reaction with sodium cyano-borohydride, yielding a stable secondary amine, Figure 3.7 b).89

3.3 Methods of analysis 

3.3.1 Contact angle 

Contact angle is employed to determine the wettability of a surface. The contact angle is defined as the 

angle formed in the point where solid, liquid, and vapour co-exist, also referred as the “three-phase contact 

line”. The contact angle is geometrically acquired by applying a tangent line from the contact point along the 

liquid-vapour interface in the droplet profile. The angle, ?, between the surface and the static drop deposited 

indicates the wettability of the sample. Small contact angles (« 90º) correspond to high wettability, while large 

contact angles (» 90º) correspond to low wettability, Figure 3.8. Specifically, a contact angle less than 90º 

indicates that wetting of the surface is favourable, and the fluid will spread over a large area on the surface; 

while contact angle greater than 90º generally means that wetting of the surface is unfavourable so the fluid will 

minimize its contact with the surface and form a compact liquid droplet. Complete wetting occurs when the 

contact angle is 0º.90

3.3.2 Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen 

 The Kjeldahl method was developed by Johann Kjeldahl in 1883, and is usually considered to be the 

standard method to determine protein concentration. The method is based on a preliminary transformation of 

all the compounds of total nitrogen, organic and inorganic, to nitrate by digestion of an alkaline with a strong 

acid. Upon digestion, nitrogen is released and can be determined by a suitable titration technique. The total 

nitrogen in the sample is liberated at high temperature. UV-visible spectrophotometry constitutes one of the 

several techniques that can be used to measure the total nitrogen using Kjeldahl method. First, a calibration 

curve of absorbance versus nitrate concentration is prepared using a series of nitrate solutions of known 

concentration. The absorbance of the solution being analysed is then measured at the same wavelength, and its 

nitrate concentration determined from the calibration curve.91  

 

3.3.3 Cell viability assay: MTT test 

3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide, is a yellow water-soluble tetrazolium 

salt, commonly represented by MTT. MTT assay is a colorimetric cell viability test, mainly used for 

spectrophotometric assessment of the metabolic activities of microorganisms, due to the colour yielded upon its 

enzymatic reduction. The yellow tetrazolium MTT is metabolically reduced by active cells, in part by the action 

of dehydrogenase enzyme, to yield a water-insoluble purple formazan crystal, which can be solubilized and 

quantified spectrophotometrically. The total amount of formazan produced is directly proportional to the 

number of viable cells in the culture; thus, the MTT assay represents a standard method for the indirect 

estimation of cell’s viability. MTT dye is light sensitive; thus, the assays are usually done in the dark. MTT is 

currently the most employed method to assess cell proliferation; however, tetrazolium dye assays can also be 

used to measure cytotoxicity (loss of viable cells) or cytostatic activity (shift from proliferation to quiescence) 

of potential medicinal agents and toxic materials. The reason for its usage relies in its advantage to be performed 

using microplates and automated reading, significantly improving the test in terms of time and cost.92,93

CHAPTER 4 – EXPERIMENTAL PART 

 

4.1 Peptide Synthesis and Characterization 

4.1.1 Synthesis of EAK 16-II 

 The synthesis of EAK 16?II, amide terminal 

(H?Ala?Glu?Ala?Glu?Ala?Lys?Ala?Lys?Ala?Glu?Ala?Glu?Ala?Lys?Ala?Lys?NH2), followed standard 

Fmoc chemistry SPPS method. The synthesis used Syro I synthesizer (MultiSynTech GmbH, Witten, Germany) 

with reaction mixing by vigorous vortex, performed in two reactors. The Syro I used fully automated 

HBTU/HOBt in situ cycles, in DMF. 

 For each reactor, the synthesis was carried out on 0.36 mmol g?1 (resin load) of Rink Amide MBHA 

resin. The synthesis scale was 0.125 mmol, given by the product between the resin load and the resin amount 

(347.2 mg). It is always used an excess of 10% in the resin amount calculated by the synthesizer. The resin was 

swallowed in DMF for 15 min. The quantities of the condensation reaction and every performed step are 

intrinsic to the synthesis and depend on the protocol followed. The overall volume (in mL) was displayed by 

the calculation protocol given by the synthesizer, and all the solutions were prepared in excess. The loading of 

the first amino acid (Lys) was carried out with double coupling. The following insertions were carried out with 

single couplings, and with double couplings from the 6th cycle till the end of the synthesis. The calculation 

protocol estimated a synthesis time of 1 day, 13 hours and 29 minutes. 

 

At each cycle, the ?-amino function of the growing peptide suffered a reaction of Fmoc-de-protection, 

which comprises a three-step procedure: 

1. Reaction with 1mL of a solution of 40% (V/V) of piperidine in DMF for 3 minutes; 

2. Reaction with 1.8 mL of a solution of 20% (V/V) of piperidine in DMF for 12 minutes; 

3. 6 washing steps, for reaction, with DMF, emptying the reactor of the liquid phase.   

The resin is the first compound to be Fmoc-de-protected and is followed a piperidine test to evaluate 

the resin loading. The piperidine test was performed by taking a sample of the functionalized resin with a weight 

in the range of 4?8 mg. The sample was washed several times with methanol and left to dry under vacuum for 

1 hour. Once dried, the sample was carefully weighted (must fit in the same range), and treated with 0.5 mL 

solution of 20% piperidine in DMF. The solution was left in contact with the resin for 15 minutes by shaking it 

manually. The deprotection of the amine group bound to the solid support generates the DBF intermediate which 

absorbs at a wavelength (?) of 301 nm. The mixture is brought to a final volume (V) of 50 mL with DMF, and 

the absorbance at ?=301 nm is measured using the double-beam spectrophotometer UV/Vis Lambda 2, Perkin 

Elmer (Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). Absorption values measured at absorbance maxima can be used, in 



 

66 

 

combination with the respective molar absorption coefficient (?=7800 M?1cm?1), to calculate the load of resins 

and amino acids, Equation 1: 

????????? =
(?301×?)

?×??
,             (Eq. 1) 

 

where loadresin is expressed in mmol g
?1 and it represent how many moles (mmoles) of reactive sites (for 

coupling) are present in 1 g of resin. A301 is the absorbance at 301 nm, V is the volume of the solution in [mL], 

? is the molar absorptivity in [M?1cm?1], and wt is the weight of the sample after dried in [g]. Eq. 1 gives the 

result for an experimental resin load. The yield of loading is given by Equation 2: 

 

? (%) =
???????????? ???????

??????????? ???????
× 100,         (Eq. 2) 

 

The activation of the carboxylic group was carried out using coupling reagents HBTU/HOBt/DMF. 

HBTU is the condensing reagent and HOBt is the coupling reagent that activates the carboxylic group. This 

activation uses a two-step procedure: 

1. 45 minutes reaction of resin-peptidyl in the reactor with a mixture of: 

- 5 equivalents (in solution) of ?-protected amino acids in DMF (1 mL of a 0.62 M solution); 

- 1.4 mL solution of 0.45 M HBTU/HOBt/DMF; 

- 10 equivalents (in solution) of DIPEA/NMP (0.625 mL of a 2 M). 

2. 5 washing steps for reaction with DMF. 

In a first attempt, the resin load resulted in 86%. Although this shortcoming conditioned the success of 

the remaining synthesis, it is a typical problem found when synthesizing self-assembling peptides. This can be 

controlled substituting the coupling reagents and performing more than one coupling per amino acid. The 

coupling reagents HBTU/HOBt were substituted by HATU/Oxima pure in the same proportions.  

 

To determine the presence of free amino groups, and consequently the yield of the reaction, a Kaiser 

test is performed, usually at the end of all coupling reactions. The procedure for this test constituted in the 

following steps: take a sample of resin in the range of 2?8 mg, which was firstly washed 3 times with methanol 

and then, 2?3 drops of acetic acid was added (to avoid eventual Fmoc-removal). The sample was dried under 

vacuum for 1 hour and weighted again. Prepare Monitor 1, Monitor 2, and Monitor 3. 

- Monitor 1 (solution of 76% (w/w) of Phenol/Ethanol); 

- Monitor 2 (solution of 0.2 mM of KCN/Pyridine); 

- Monitor 3 (solution of 0.28 M of Ninhydrin/Ethanol). 

In the tube containing the resin was orderly added 75 ?L of Monitor 1, 100 ?L of Monitor 2, and 75 ?L 

of Monitor 3. In another tube, was prepared for reference the same solution excluding the resin. Both mixtures 

were heated at 100ºC for 5 minutes and added to a 4.8 mL of a solution of methanol at 60%. After centrifugation, 



 

67 

 

the absorbance of the liquid phase was measured at 570 nm (?=15000 M?1cm?1). The quantity of free amino 

function is calculated using Equation 3: 

 

?mol/g of aminic groups =
(?×?×10?6)

?×?
,          (Eq. 3) 

 

where, A is the difference between the value of absorbance of the sample and the value of absorbance of the 

reference solution a 570 nm; V is the volume of the sample expressed in [mL]; and P is the weight of the sample 

in [mg]. 

The yield of the coupling reactions is given by Equation 4: 

 

? (%) = {1 ? [
?mol/g of aminic groups

?????????×10
?3

]} × 100,       (Eq. 4) 

  

 The peptide cleavage from the resin and the removal of the side chain protecting groups was done under 

acidic conditions, using TFA as the strong acid, and TES as scavenger to avoid undesired secondary reactions. 

The procedure included the following six steps: 

1. Once the synthesis was accomplished, the N-terminal function of the Fmoc-protecting group was 

automatically removed treating the resin-peptidyl with a solution of 20% piperidine in DMF for 20 min; 

2. The resin-peptidyl without the Fmoc group was washed with DCM, and dried under vacuum for 2 

hours; 

3. The resin-peptidyl was transferred to a flask and treated with a solution of 95% TFA, 2.5% H2O 

milliQ, and 2.5% TES (v/v/v); 

4. The mixture was kept under magnetic stir at room temperature, for 1 hour and 30 minutes; 

5. The resin was separated by filtration with gooch G3, and the solution containing the peptide was 

transported to a rotary evaporator; 

6. Once added cold diethyl ether (~4ºC), the peptide precipitated, and was filtrated with a gooch G4, 

dried, dissolved in H2O MilliQ, frozen, and lyophilized using Labconco FreeZone
® 2.5 (Terra Universal, Inc, 

Fullerton, CA). 

 

4.1.2 Characterization of EAK 16?II   

Peptide purification was conducted using semi-preparative (SP) RP?HPLC. SP uses the same principle 

of protein/peptide retention as the one described in section 3.2.2. 

The total amount of crude peptide (144.36 mg) was divided in four parts: SP1=35 mg, SP2=35 mg, 

SP3=34.7 mg, and SP4=39.6 mg. For each quantity, the peptide (mg) was dissolved in around the same quantity 

of Eluent A (mL). Magnetic stirrer and ultrasonic bath were used to complete the dissolution for around 5 

minutes, each. The solution was filtered. SP was carried out using NovaPack® HR C18 Column (6 ?m, 60 Å, 



 

68 

 

7.8x300 mm), Waters 600 E System Controller, and Waters 2487 Dual ? Absorbance Detector at ?=214 nm, all 

provided by Waters (Milford, Massachusetts, USA). The machine was set for a 4 mL min?1 flow, with a gradient 

from 7 to 17% of Eluent B in A for 40 minutes. The results were carefully analysed, and the best fractions were 

selected for HPLC, Figure 4.1. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Were selected fractions 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 25, 26, 27, and 28, from SP1. From each selected 

fraction, samples of, no more than, 150 µL±10% were collected and analysed using Jupiter C18 Column (5 ?m, 

300 Å, 250x10 mm), from Phenomenex® (Torrance, California, USA), HPLC Waters 600 E System Controller 

for chromatographic analysis, Waters 2487 Dual ? Absorbance Detector at ?=214 nm, and the Empower 

software for acquisition and integration, all provided by Waters. The machine was set for a 1 mL min?1 flow, 

with a gradient from 7 to 27% of Eluent B in A for 20 minutes, with initial method using partial loop. Figure 

4.2 shows the resultant chromatogram for fraction 13. It is verified a large peak at retention time (RT) of 11.238 

min with a purity of ~87%. A second small peak is verified with less purity percentage (~12.93%) which refers 

to the presence of some impurities in this fraction, since it was absorbed at a lower absorbance (AU, 

adimensional unit).

represent the fractions selected for analytical HPLC. From right to left: the first peak represents the conditioning 

of the column, that may suffer some instabilities, resulting in this peak; when gradient starts (0% of Eluent B), a 

peak appears for the same reason; at ~10% of Eluent B, the target, and purest, peptide (named core) elutes from 

the column; the last peak results from the washing of the column, where there must elute some leftovers of the 

target peptide.

The procedure was repeated for all parts of the divided peptide. The purest peptide fractions obtained 

were placed into polls (core, Table 3), and purified over again according to the described methodology. This 

time, for HPLC analytics, was used Vydac® 238EV54 (Everest) HR C18 Column by Grace Davison Discovery 

SciencesTM (Columbia, MD, USA), with the same gradient, Figure 4.3. After freeze-drying, it resulted in a final 

quantity of 10.66 mg of peptide, with a purity of ~91%.

Molecular weight was confirmed by mass analysis using AB Sciex – 4800 MALDI TOF/TOF Analyzer 

(Sciex, USA), and the software 4000 series. A small quantity of peptide, in the range of 0.3?0.7 mg, was 

weighted and dissolved in the same quantity of H2O MilliQ. The samples were in a plate and covered with the 

MALDI matrix. The range of masses used for all the fractions was 800–5000 Da, being the expected mass 

1615.80 Da. EAK 16-II resulted in an experimental mass of 1614.45 Da, considered equal to the theoretical 

value.

4.1.3 Synthesis of HVP?CHO 

 The synthesis of HVP?CHO, aldehyde terminal, 

(H?Phe?Arg?His?Arg?Asn?Arg?Lys?Gly?Tyr?x?Phe?CHO) followed standard Fmoc chemistry SPPS 

method. The synthesis used Syro I synthesizer with reaction mixing by vigorous vortex. The Syro I used fully 

automated HBTU/HOBt in situ cycles, in DMF. 

 The synthesis was carried out on 0.18 mmol g?1 (resin load) of H?Phe?H NovaSyn® TG resin. The 

synthesis scale was 0.094 mmol, given by the product between the resin load and the resin amount (500 mg). It 

is always used an excess of 10% in the resin amount calculated by the synthesizer. The resin was swallowed in 

DMF for 15 min.  

HVP?CHO synthesis used the same protocol for Fmoc-de-protection, carboxylic activation, ninhydrin 

test, and peptide cleavage and side chain protecting groups removal, as the one described in the section 4.1.1. 

This synthesis doesn’t require a test to evaluate the load of the resin (piperidine test), because the first amino 

acid in the sequence (Phe) comes with the resin. The 7-aminoheptanoic acids act as a spacer for the molecule. 

The loading of the first amino acid was carried out with double coupling. The following insertions were carried 

out with single couplings, and with double couplings from the 5th cycle till the end of the synthesis. The 

calculation protocol estimated a synthesis time of 22 hours and 1 minute.  

  

4.1.4 Characterization of HVP?CHO 

HVP?CHO is a peptide which usually yields high levels of purity even before fractioning. Before SP, 

the crude peptide (4.68 mg) was analysed with RP-HPLC given a purity of ~85%, Figure 4.4. 

 

 

Table 5. % Area giving the purity of 

HVP before SP. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 To avoid loss of material, it wasn’t conducted any fractioning of this molecule, since it is not needed 

for the level of purity obtained. Crude peptide was lyophilized resulting in a final quantity of 3.98 mg of pure 

peptide. Molecular weight was confirmed using mass analysis, resulting in an experimental value of 1472.69 

Da, relatively close to the theoretical value of 1507.76 Da.

4.2 PCL matrices production 

The electrospinning apparatus was composed by a syringe of 2.5 mL, a 27G needle from Terumo 

(Tokyo, Japan) assembled on the syringe, a volumetric pump from New Era Pimp Systems Inc. (Farmingdale, 

New York, USA) on which the syringe was set up, a high voltage generator from Gamma High Voltage 

(Ormond Beach, Florida, USA), a rectangular collector (8 cm x 8 cm) wrapped with an aluminium foil to 

facilitate the removal, an air tube collected to a barometer, and a HD 2301.0 Thermohygrometer from Delta 

Ohm (Caselle di Selvazzano, Padua, Italy). 

Spherules of PCL were dissolved in HFIP at different concentrations, to obtain different viscosities. 

Initially, few experiments were conducted dissolving PCL spherules in DCM (cheaper solvent); however, 

weren’t formed any fibres, resulting only in beads deposition. This fact can be explained with the resultant low 

viscosity of the solution. Processing parameters were tuned to obtain submicro- and nano-fibres of PCL at very 

low flow rate. Air was used as shell flow, providing more energy to the jet and helping the solvent to evaporate 

earlier.  

The samples were divided in two batches. The first batch includes the experiments in which the 

processing and solution parameters were based in the ones used by Zavattin, D. et. al., that has obtained 

successful results in producing fibres in the range of micro- and nano-dimensions.94 Table 6 shows the 

parameters that were varied: polymer concentration of 25% and 30% PCL in HFIP (w/v) and presence/absence 

of air flow, labelled respectively as A (air) and NA (no air). Temperature and relative humidity (RH) are two 

difficult parameters to control, depending on several local and environment conditions. The variety presented 

in Table 6 for these two parameters are explained with the difficulty in stabilizing them. For all cases studied, 

the collector was located at 22 cm from the syringe, was applied a voltage of 20 kV to the fluid with a flow rate 

of 0.2 mL h?1.

The second batch includes a group of samples with the polymer concentration of 30% PCL in HFIP. 

This concentration was selected based on the type and quality of fibres after naked eye and SEM observations. 

In this case, all the experiments used coaxial air flow at different pressures, and the applied voltage still the 



 

72 

 

same. This batch intends to evaluate the effect verified with a decrease in the flow rate from 0.2 to 0.1 mL h?1 

and varying the distance between the syringe and the collector, from 22 to 30 cm, as shown in Table 7.

4.3 Matrices silanization  

The silanization of the matrices was performed using the APPJ technique described in the section 3.2.3. 

APPJ used the argon driven plasma jet Stylu Plasma provided by Nadir (Mestre, Venice, Italy) to deposit 

(3?aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES), which structure can be seen in Figure 4.5. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

APTES films on the electrospun PCL matrices are intended to enrich the surface with amine (NH2) 

groups. APTES is an aminosilane frequently used in the process of silanization, the functionalization of surfaces 

with organofunctional alkoxysilane molecules. Surface amine groups on APTES thin films promote physical 

adsorption increasing affinity between silicon substrates and biomolecules. Through the addition of APTES, 

reactive hydroxyl groups were converted into amino-terminal groups. APTES functionalization can be done 

with plasma treatment technique. The use of this kind of functionalization in PCL hydrophobic matrices, 

enhance the hydrophilicity of the fibre mats. Hence, it allows the interactions between the mat and the 

surrounding environment.72 The amine functionality of APTES has been used to immobilize polymers and 

proteins, as well as to promote cell adhesion.95 

APPJ was conducted by tuning several working parameters to obtain different concentrations of the 

chemical precursor APTES, and, hence, different concentration of amino groups deposited in the substrates. 

The working parameters presented in Table 8 were based in the studies done by Maffei, A. et. Al., in which they 

have varied high voltage, radio-frequency, impulse, distance, different atmospheres for cooling (air and N2),

and the number of scans done for one sample at a time. They have performed five different functionalizations.  

The values were selected according to the results obtained for each silanization, such as the film thickness and 

the concentration of atoms of nitrogen (N) present after deposition that had influenced the chemo-selective 

ligation with bioactive molecules. In this case, Argon (Ar) was the gas selected as plasma gas, and as carrier for 

APTES molecules. The inclusion of the chemical precursor implies the passage of Ar gas through a bubbler at 

room temperature. An atmosphere of nitrogen (N2) was created to control both: the cooling of the RF electrode 

and the atmosphere close to the plasma jet. The substrates were fixed, one at a time, on a planar platform that 

moved simultaneously along X and Y axes with controlled velocity of 300 mm s?1. This allows the torch to scan 

all the sample area. Samples were cut in square forms of (2 x 2 ± 0.05 cm2) and located at 2 mm from the torch. 

Every sample was scanned 40 times (~3 minutes). Was applied a high voltage of 9.6 kV peak to peak, the radio-

frequency varied from 12 to 20 W, with a pulsed jet of 50% d.c. (duty cycle) [hz], or continuous plasma jet.

4.4 Contact angle measurements 

 The surface wettability was traced by measuring the static water contact angle, after ~72 hours of 

treatment. An OCA30 instrument (DataPhysics Instruments GmbH, Filderstadt, Baden-Württemberg, 

Germany), equipped with a CCD camera for the dropshape analysis, was at 25ºC and 65% of relative humidity. 

The electrospun layers were fixed on glass coverslips by double-sided tape. 2 ?L of ultra-pure water were 

applied on different areas of the surface. The static contact angles were then measured on both sides of the two-

dimensional projection of the droplet by digital image analysis.  

 

 

4.5 Scanning Electron Microscopy 

The morphology of electrospun PCL fibres was examined using an environmental Scanning Electron 

Microscope (SEM) (Zeiss EVO 50, Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany), with an electron accelerating 

voltage of 20 kV, without coating the samples. Was used a SEM with low vacuum to prevent charging of the 

samples. The average fibre diameter of the electrospun fibres was measured by ImageJ 1.52a software (National 

Institute of Health, USA) from the SEM pictures in original magnification.

4.6 Selective immobilization of HVP on the silanized matrices   

 The synthesis of HVP using a polymeric support with a Phe amino acid incorporated gives an aldehyde 

group in the resultant molecule free for ligation, marked in red in Figure 4.6.  

 

This allows the biochemical conjugation, described in section 3.2.4, between the amino groups present 

in the surface, obtained from the previous surface treatment, with the aldehyde group. This is a specific 

functionalization since the peptide bond is exploited only by the aldehyde group, supporting an ordered 

deposition of the biomolecule on the surface. The spacer included in the HVP sequence during the synthesis 

gives a degree of freedom to the molecule, so it can have flexibility to move and perform it functions, Figure 

4.7. 

 

 

For the bio-functionalization of the silanized surfaces were cut PCL layers in circles with diameter of 

~6.4 mm. Were cut three samples for each treatment to perform bio-conjugation with HVP peptide, labeled 

PCL_01_F, PCL_03_F, and PCL_04_F, three samples for each treatment without bio-functionalization for 

comparison, labelled PCL_01, PCL_02, and PCL_03, and 3 samples without any surface modification. The 

samples were distributed in the wells of a treated tissue culture plate of 96 wells (well diameter 6.4 mm, well 

volume 360 ?L, well working volume 75?200 ?L) provided by Sigma-Aldrich (Corning®, Turin, Italy). Was 

prepared a buffer solution of sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate (NaH2PO4.H20) with a concentration 

of 20 mM, and sodium chloride (NaCl) with a concentration of 200 mM, in H2O milliQ. This solution was 

stabilized at pH 7.5, measured with sensiON – pH3 provided by Hach® (Lange, Milano Linate, Italy). The 

reductive agent sodium cyanoborohydride (NaBH3CN) was added to the buffer solution in a concentration of 3 

mg mL?1. The resultant solution was filtered with a filter of polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF). The peptide was

dissolved in this solution at a concentration of 1 mg mL?1. The solution was placed in every well prepared for 

bio-functionalization 100 ?L of this solution. It was left to react with the silanized surface overnight, and 

removed after 24 hours. Then, the surfaces were rinsed three times with H2O milliQ, and dried at room 

temperature.   

 

4.7 Surface chemistry analysis 

Surface chemistry was analysed by measuring the total nitrogen with the method described in the section 

3.3.5. This method permits the measurement of total N in the range of 0.1-0.7 mg/L. PCL silanized and bio-

functionalized samples were weighted and dissolved in 100 ?L of HFIP. This solution was brought to a volume 

of 50 mL with milliQ H2O. Was added 7 mL of oxidant solution Antimony potassium tartrate 

(KOOC(CHOH)2COOSbO), and 0.3 g of Potassium Persulfate (K2S2O8) to 50 mL sample solution. The same 

quantities of potassium tartrate and potassium persulfate were added to 50 mL of bare deionized water for 

reference. The samples were heated at 120 ºC for 30 minutes, and the cooling was done at room temperature. 

The analysis was conducted after withdrawal of 10 mL of digested sample and acidification with 0.15 mL of 

sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The digestion is strongly alkaline at the outset, which promotes oxidation of nitrogen to 

nitrate. Absorbance was detected at ?=200 nm, retrieving the total nitrogen concentration through a calibration 

curve. 

 

4.8 Biological assays 

 In this section is described the procedure to test the viability of the multi-layer scaffold to incorporate 

cells and allow them to perform their functions of proliferation and migration within. First, the scaffold was 

assembled with a 3D gradient obtained from the combination of bio-functionalized electrospun fibre mats with 

hydrogel from self-assembling peptides. This first trial was important to perceive the limitations of both systems 

when combined. In the hydrogel was incorporated the growth factor human recombinant Fibroblast Growth 

Factor (rh?FGF), and the inflammatory cytokine, Interleukin-6 (IL?6). In a second approach, the scaffold was 

‘disassembled’ aiming to study each component separately and where was possible to evaluate the cell adhesion 

on the bio-functionalized surfaces. The biological assay comprises the cell culture and the cell seeding.  

 

4.8.1 Cell culture 

We opted for a culture using primary cells instead of a cell line. Primary cells are not immortalized cells 

(cancer like phenotype) and are believed to be better for this type of experiments since measurement of 

replication is like normal cells. 

Human bone cells were obtained from explants of cortical mandible bone collected by surgery. The 

patient was a 37 years old, healthy man. The study was approved by the local ethics committee, and informed 



 

76 

 

consent was obtained from the patient. Bone fragments were initially cultured in D-MEM/F12 (1:1) 

supplemented with 20% v/v fetal bovine serum, 1% v/v sodium pyruvate, 1% v/v nonessential amino acids, 1% 

v/v antibiotic-antimycotic solution, and 1 U/mL insulin, until cells migrated from tissue. At confluence, cells 

were detached by trypsin-EDTA and cultured in complete medium supplemented with 50 ?g mL?1 ascorbic 

acid, 10 nM dexamethasone, and 10 mM ?-glycerophosphate. For the separation using trypsin, the residual 

culture media containing a trypsin inhibitor needs to be firstly removed. The cells were washed with 0.1 % v/v 

of Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS), and trypsin was added, centrifuging the cells with 1600 rpm for 6 minutes. 

 

4.8.2 Cell adhesion 

To evaluate cell adhesion to the bio-functionalized layers of PCL, we use the tissue culture plate referred 

in the section 4.7. The samples of electrospun layers were sterilized in 20% (v/v) ethanol for 10 minutes, 

including the layers for control. After sterilization, samples were washed in PBS for 5 minutes. Was seeded a 

solution of 100 ?L, containing ~1×104 cells of human h-osteoblasts per well, for an incubation time of 2 hours, 

at 37 ºC. At the end of the incubation, culture medium was discharged, and non-adherent cells were removed 

by extensive washes in PBS, and cellular viability was assessed by using the MTT assay already described 

herein. Samples were then incubated for 4 hours at 37 ºC with 100 ?L of fresh complete medium containing 

MTT (5 mg/mL). The reaction was stopped by adding a 10% w/v sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) solution 

acidified with 0.01 M HCl, and samples were stirred for 12 hours. To quantify the number of cells, a standard 

curve was obtained for each experiment by culturing a known number of h-osteoblasts in complete medium. At 

the end, cellular lysate (100 ?L) were transferred to a new 96-well tissue culture plate to determine the 

absorbance at ?=620 nm, using a microplate reader (Sunrise, Tecan, Milan, Italy). 

 

 

4.8.3 Scaffold assembly and cell seeding 

Scaffold assembly proceed with manual bottom-up layer-by-layer building stack. Two scaffolds were 

prepared: one where the PCL layers were conveniently functionalized, and one for control, where the layers 

were only submitted to plasma treatment. PCL layers were first sterilized with an exposition to UV radiation 

for 5 minutes, including the layers for control. PCL membranes were placed between two frames of 

polycarbonate (PC) with thickness in the range of 0.1-0-3, obtained by a machine press. The films were cut into 

4x4 cm2 frames, with a centred square 1x1 cm2 hole. Hydrogels with concentration of 1% (w/v) were prepared 

by dissolving 10 mg/mL of EAK 16-II in PBS. For the functionalized scaffold, three layers of hydrogel were 

prepared labelled as Hydrogel 1, Hydrogel 2, and Hydrogel 3. For each layer were prepared a mixture with 15 

?L (0.15 mg of SAP) of EAK-hydrogel, 11 ?L of PBS, 2 ?L of rhFGF, and 2 ?L of IL?6, these last two at 

different concentration, and differing the concentration from layer to layer, as shown in Table 9. This mixture 

was prepared on time in Eppendorf and placed on top of PCL membranes, Figure 4.8.

PCL 2 6 Hydrogel 2 0.0032 0.0032 

PCL 3 3.4 Hydrogel 3 0.00064 0.016 

 

From bottom to top, the assembly was done by placing PCL layers from highest to lowest concentration 

of HVP, labelled, respectively, as PCL 1, PCL 2, and PCL 3, Table 9. 

The scaffold for control used the same procedure for stacking, but in its turn the hydrogel layers 

included only 10 ?L of EAK?hydrogel. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

After assembling, a 40 ?L solution, containing ~3×105 cells, was implanted on top of the functionalized 

scaffold, repeating the procedure for the control scaffold. Both scaffolds were immersed in culture media. After 

3 days, scaffolds were rinsed several times using PBS. Human h-osteoblasts cells were fixed for 10 minutes 

with a solution of 4% (w/v) of PFA in PBS at room temperature, pH 8. After washing it three times with Tris-

Buffered Saline (TBS) for 5 minutes each, the samples were incubated with 0.05 M of ammonium chloride in 

PBS for 10 minutes, to reduce auto-florescence. Then, three additional 5 minutes washes were performed with 

TBS; and a solution consisting of 2% v/v of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and of 0.3% v/v of Triton X-100 in 

TBS was added for 30 minutes, to block non-specific bonds and permeabilize the cells. The samples were then 

incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature with the p-FAK antibody generated in rabbit and diluted 1:500 

in TBS containing BSA 2% w/v and Triton X-100 0.3% v/v. At the end of the incubation, the samples were 

washed and then incubated again for 45 minutes with a second antibody conjugated to the fluorophore Alexa 

Fluor 488, which emits in the green. After incubation, the samples were washed with TBS three times and then 

prepared for analysis under confocal microscopy, by adding a drop of 70% glycerol and sealed with a coverslip. 

All this procedure was performed within a class II microbiological safety cabinet. Image acquisition was 

performed using Leica TCS-NT/SP2 fluorescence confocal microscope and the matching Leica software, 

provided by Leica Microsystems GmbH (Wetzlar, Germany). Scaffold’s thickness was measured using a digital 

micrometre.

CHAPTER 5 – RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

 

5.1 Contact angle analysis 

Silanized samples using the conditions for treatment 03, PCL_03 and PCL_03_ F, where the last one 

received an additional bio-functionalization with a covalent immobilization of HVP at the surface, were 

submitted for contact angle measurements. Data are reported as the average of five separate measurements. The 

water contact angle measurements showed that both samples drastically improved their wettability, as shown in 

Table 10, since they were characteristically hydrophobic before treatment. The contact angle for samples only 

submitted to silanization (PCL_03) present complete wettability (?=0º), while samples that were bio-

functionalized show a slightly decrease in the wettability (?=25º).

The present values for contact angle after plasma treatment demonstrated a strongly increase in 

wettability suggesting that the plasma-treated PCL surfaces contain many hydrophilic groups, thus indicating 

the generation of functional groups and/or morphological changes on the PCL surfaces. Bio-functionalized 

samples present less favourable wettability, a fact that can be explained by the presence of more molecules on 

the surface, affecting the disposal of the water drop, and, consequently, affecting the contact angle measure. 

Usually, untreated PCL has a contact angle above of 90º, indicating the natural hydrophobic characteristic of 

this polymer. The introduction of Ar-containing polar groups in the fibres surface resulted in a significant change 

of hydrophilicity. After treating the PCL fibres, the water contact angle decreased meaning that APTES-

precursor hydrolysed the amide bonds resulting in amine functional groups on the PCL surfaces. These 

functional groups, deposited by plasma, increased the surface energy of the fibres, contributing to the lower 

water contact angle, thus making the fibre surface less hydrophobic. After APP treatment, the water droplet was 

absorbed into the fibres immediately, showing complete wettability, and a water contact angle of 0º was 

observed.  

 

 

5.2 Morphological characterization of PCL fibres 

 In this study, we explored the electrospinning capability to produce micro- and nanofibres of PCL to 

generate 3D scaffolds for tissue engineering. First, we focused in the control of the working parameters ideal

for obtaining fibres in the required dimensional range. Second, we selected the best fibres for coating the surface 

to improve their biocompatibility. We selected the fibres based on their fibre diameter and porosity like the ones 

of ECM tissues, and with morphologies suitable for cell attachment and proliferation.  

 

5.2.1 Effect of coaxial air flow and polymer concentration 

 A series of experiments were carried out when the initial polymer concentration was varied, in presence 

or absence of coaxial air flow. Solutions were processed with PCL concentrations varying from 25 to 30% in 

HFIP, and varying the pressure of coaxial air flow from 0 to 0.2 bar, at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/h, a tip -target 

distance of 22 cm, and an applied voltage of 20 kV. SEM micrographs were used to analyse the influence of 

both parameters on the resulting morphology, and results are shown in Figure 5.1.  

For 25% PCL, electrospinning process produced primarily polymer beads, and sparse fibres, (Figure 

5.1 A, B, and C). This situation is improved when at the same concentration, the process is carried with the 

presence of coaxial air flow (0.2 bar), (Figure 5.1 D, E, and F). At concentration of 30% PCL beads were still 

visible, (Figure 5.1 G, H, and I). However, in the presence of coaxial air flow, the number of beads significantly 

decreased, resulting in fibres with almost consistent morphology (Figure 5.1 J, K, and L). SEM micrographs 

showed that the presence of air flow has a positive influence in reducing beads for both concentrations. Results 

for 30% PCL were favourable than for 25% PCL. Changing the polymer concentration could alter the solution 

viscosity. For 25% PCL is expected a solution with lower viscosity than 30% PCL and it has been proven that 

continuous and smooth fibres cannot be obtained in very low viscosity. The unfavourable results given for 25% 

PCL fibres may be explained by this fact, and by the insufficiency of chain entanglements to stabilize the jet. 

The results allowed the selection of fibres using 30% PCL in presence of coaxial air flow for further studies. 

 

5.2.2 Effect of tip-target distance and flow rate 

 Electrospun fibres for concentration of 30% PCL were used to vary the tip-target distance from 22 to 

30 cm; however, tip-target distance had no significant effect on the electrospun fibres morphology, as shown in 

Figure 31, where the micrographs were practically undistinguishable. The morphological structure can be 

slightly changed by changing the solution flow rate, as shown in the same Figure 5.2. At the flow rate of 0.1 

mL/h, a few big beads were observed on the fibres. The flow rate could affect electrospinning process. 

Generally, lower flow rate is more recommended as the polymer solution will get enough time for polarization, 

oppositely to high flow rate that usually leads to beaded fibres with thick diameters. Contrary to what was 

expected, the presence of beads and beaded fibres was decreased for higher flow rate (0.2 mL h?1). For the 

results using lower tip-target distance, it was assumed that solution jets were elongated and solidified quickly 

after they flowed out of the needle tip. Lower distances are usual responsible for thinner fibre diameters, as can 

be observed. However, due to the presence of beads, the fibres respected to higher flow rate and tip-target 

distance, (Figure 5.2 D, E, and F), were the ones selected for surface treatment.

other parameters remain equal. 

 

 

5.2.3 Effect of surface treatment 

 The change in surface topography on PCL nanofibres before and after plasma modification by argon-

driven plasma was determined by SEM. Three samples: a matrix without coating, a matrix coated with treatment 

03 (PCL_03), and a matrix coated with treatment 04 (PCL_04), were selected for SEM examination. PCL fibres 

with 30% polymer concentration, collected at 30 cm of tip-target distance, at a flow rate of 0.2 mL h?1 were 

selected for surface treatment using plasma polymer deposition with APP method. The results were compared 

with surfaces without being treated, and the results are shown in Figure 5.3. Based on the SEM micrographs, 

plasma treatment had no significant effect on the surface morphology of PCL fibres. All samples present a 

smooth surface topography, with reduce quantity of beads. Based on the micrographs for not-coated (Figure 5.3 

A, B, and C) and coated-PCL_03 (Figure 5.3 D, E, and F), plasma treatment did not change the porosity of the 

fibres. Both have highly porous structures with interconnected pores. However, for PCL_04 (Figure 5.3 G, H, 

and I) open porosity in the fibres, point-bounded junctions, and melting of thinner fibres can be observed.  

 



 

83 

 

 

Figure 5.3 Scanning electron micrographs of PCL electrospun nanofibres depicting the effect of plasma 

surface treatment, for treatments 03 and 04, and comparing with non-coated surfaces. 

 

 

The average diameter of the collected electrospun PCL fibres was 190 nm, with fibres ranging from 16 

to 696 nm, which indicates their dimensional characteristics as micro- and nanofibres. For each case, fibre 

diameter was obtained with an average of ~200 measurements, and the fibres distribution is shown in Figure 

5.4. There’s more frequency of fibres ranging from 100 to 200 nm for all the matrices.  

 

Normally the fibre diameter of the matrices conform to the structural properties of the ECM are on the 

order of 80?500 nm. The diameter of electrospun PCL nanofibres was around 190 nm, suggesting their potential 

applications as tissue engineering scaffolds, capable to provide ECM-like morphologies. SEM images showed 

that obtained fibres were continuous and almost bead free, with interconnected microfibre and web-like 

nanofibre formation between. High scaffold porosity is preferable for cell seeding, adhesion and tissue in-

growth because of high surface area-to-volume ratio, which elicits better diffusion of oxygen and nutrients into 

the scaffolds. Ideally, the structure of the scaffold must be highly porous, with open pores and fully

interconnected. Depending upon the cell type, the optimal pore diameters are 20?100 ?m. The percentage of 

porosity and the pore size were not measured due to the low resolution of the images for segmentation 

computing methods; however, it can be perceptible by the SEM micrographs the presence of large and 

interconnected pores, that may favour the cell’s movement. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5.3 Surface chemistry analysis 

The properties of the organic layer deposited by plasma, such as density and orientation of the molecules 

within the layer, are directly influenced by the choice of alkoxysilane. APTES represents a popular choice as it 

allows for further attachment of molecules through its terminal amines and exhibits self-assembly. The 

silanization reaction aim to provide a more uniform monolayer surface with an aminopropyl-terminal, resulted 

from the anhydrous conditions where it happens. There are several reactions in the silanization process that will

result in a combination of the final configuration of the amine groups, Figure 5.5. Ideally, the amine group 

should point toward the liquid phase, leaving free amine groups available for further functionalization.96 

 

 

However, obtaining a uniform monolayer with amine groups oriented away from the underlying 

substrate can be a complex issue, as APTES is very sensitive to many reaction conditions, such as induced 

condensation reactions. Hydrogen bonding can result in unhydrolyzed APTES molecules with intact ethoxy 

groups adsorbing on the initial covalently bound APTES layer, resulting in vertical multilayering. In this case, 

APTES molecules physisorb to each other on an already APTES-treated surface, as seen in Figure 5.6. The film 

continuous to increase in density with further deposition leading to hydrogen bonding with previous deposited 

APTES, compressing the layer closest to the substrate.97

the ethoxy groups with the silanol-terminated silicon; c) reaction of the all three ethoxy groups with the 

silanol-terminated silicon; d) crosslinking of the APTES molecules; and, e) attachment of the NH2 group of 

the APTES molecule to the surface.96 

Figure 5.6 Schematic structure of APTES films under anhydrous deposition conditions. Some condensation may 

occur between APTES molecules and the native interface. Red circles denote bonding (both covalent and 

hydrogen bonding) while the highlighted section is meant to demonstrate that APTES molecules are bound 

at multiple sites through the film.97 



 

86 

 

This fact suggests that the thickness of the deposited layer can disfavour the silanization process, as a 

thicker film may come from condensation of APTES at the surface. Furthermore, a higher concentration of the 

APTES molecule does not mean that all these molecules are available for further functionalization, indicating 

the necessity for two types of chemical analysis at the surface to prove the efficiency of the plasma treatment. 

One to evaluate the quantity of APTES, and another to evaluate it configuration on the surface.  

The efficiency of plasma on the surfaces was studied by Maffei, A. et al., where they conducted X-ray 

photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis.94 This is a surface sensitive quantitative spectroscopic technique, 

used to analyse the surface chemistry of a material, by measuring the elemental composition, chemical state, 

and electronic state. In their studies, the atomic ratios Si/C=O and N/Si were measured, and the results are 

presented in Table 11. N/Si ratio indicates the integrity of the APTES molecules after plasma treatment and the 

efficiency of the functionalization after treatment with HVP; while Si/C=O ratio gives indications about the 

concentration of the APTES molecules on the surface. They determined the Si/C=O ratio allowing the selection 

of PCL_01, PCL_03, and PCL_04 as the matrices with ideal APTES concentration for creating a gradient. The 

ratio N/Si was expected to have a variety as the one observed in the Si/C=O ratio, and if the APTES is intact, 

the N/Si ratio must be 1. Based on these principles, PCL_01 would indicate a higher efficient rate of 

functionalization, followed by PCL_03, and the last would be PCL_04. Film thickness matched with the Si/C=O 

ratio, but it can be understood as an aftermath of the APTES condensation at the surface, as described herein. 

They proceeded with the selective HVP immobilization on the layers where the results were equally expected 

to have the same variety from layer to layer. A significant increase in the N/Si ratio was expected, to support 

the idea that APTES molecules were oriented in a way to allow functionalization with HVP. The results were 

unsatisfactory, indicating a negative influence of the HVP on the functionalization of the PCL_04 layer observed 

from the ?N/Si, and did not match with the primary Si/C=O ratio.

Based on these results, a colorimetric assay was conducted to confirm the total nitrogen content in the 

coated and bio-functionalized layers, using the protocol described in section 4.7, and the results are presented 

in Table 12. The analysis of the content of nitrate in the dissolved silanized and functionalized layers by the 

Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen method confirmed the concentration of APTES obtained with the Si/C=O ratio from 

XPS results. The nitrate content in the silanized layers comes from the titration of the nitrogen provided by the 

amino groups presented in the APTES molecules, while the nitrate content in the bio-functionalized layers, 

labelled PCL_01_F, PCL_03_F, and PCL_04_F, comes from the nitrogen provided by the amino groups present 

in the APTES molecules and present in the peptide sequence. For this reason, was expected an increase in the 

N/Si ratio. 

 

Table 12 Total nitrogen content in silanized vs. functionalized surfaces. 

 

 

 The colorimetric assay verified that PCL_01 was the more functionalized layer, supporting the previous 

XPS results. Unexpectedly, PCL_04 resulted in a zero value for functionalization, and Pure PCL (layers not 

submitted to any kind of treatment) presented a content of N atoms, contradicting it hydrophobic character. 

However, the nitrogen content analysis for the layers with posterior functionalization with protein 

immobilization has increased; a measurement that had given inconclusive results in the XPS analysis. It 

suggested the presence of well-oriented amino groups able to covalently link to HVP. The concentration of 

APTES is proportional to the concentration of the immobilized molecules at the surface. The functionalization 

resulted, in terms of HVP present at the surface, from an increase to a decrease in it concentration, in PCL_01_F, 

PCL_03_F, and PCL_04_F, with positive influence in all cases, allowing to create a gradient from adhesive 

molecules at the surface for further studies.  

 

5.4 Cell adhesion 

A covalent binding method was used to immobilize HVP on the surface of electrospun layers. The film 

created was used to test the adhesion activity of osteoblastic cells. Cell adhesion properties of the silanized and 

bio-functionalized were compared and are shown in Figure 5.7. Adhesion of cultured osteoblasts on PCL 

nanofibres was evaluated by MTT assay after incubating cells for 2 hours. Data are reported as mean and 

standard deviation (SD) of three measurements. Figure 5.7 a) illustrates the number of cells that adhere to the 

control PCL matrix (C) and the number of cells that adhere to the PCL matrices after plasma treatment 01, 03, 

and 04 (PCL_01, PCL_03, and PCL_04, respectively). Figure 5.7 b) illustrates the comparison in cell adhesion

between the matrices submitted to different plasma treatment and the matrices with further functionalization 

with HVP peptide. This graph reported the (number of cells on HVP functionalized electrospun matrix measured 

with MTT assay/number of cells seeded on electrospun matrix)×100. Data is reported as mean±SD. Statistical 

analysis was performed using the paired Student’s t-test, using Graph-Pad Prism 3.03 (San Diego, California, 

USA). P values&amp;lt;0.05 (Figure 5.7 a)) and P values&amp;lt;0.01 (Figure 5.7 b)) were considered statistically significant. 

Plasma treatment improves osteoblast adhesion, but the different plasma treatments do not modify cell adhesion. 

The increase in the case PCL_01 (Figure 57 b) is significant with respect to its control. The trend is an 

improvement of osteoblast adhesion due to functionalization. The anchoring of HVP is important and scaffold 

treated differently by plasma give the possibility to modify HVP concentration and osteoblast are influenced by 

different peptide concentration. 

 

  

Cell adhesion onto the layers enriched with HVP was greater than silanized layers, excepting for 04. It 

was verified the highest adhesion in the substrate 01, the same sample that had also resulted in the substrate 

with higher concentration of APTES. This permits to conclude that cells recognized the surface chemistries 

provided by the silanization, which had influenced their attachment. When comparing both functionalized with 

HVP layers and layers only submitted to plasma treatment, it gives an important result indicating that the cell 

adhesion does not depend on the surface treatment, but in the concentration of HVP immobilized. In fact, plasma 

treatment had no significant effect on cell adhesion; however, it directs the immobilization of adhesive proteins, 

inducing an increase of the adherent cells through protein immobilization. Cells were more prone to adhere to 

the substrate presenting HVP at its surface, even if an uncommon situation happened for 04 layers, where cells 

adhere more to the layer without bio-functionalization. This confirms the previous idea that cell adhesion not 

only depends in the presence of HVP, but it is also concentration-dependent of this molecule. Adhesion in 

plasma treated samples was poor, yet, cells reflected some cellular adhesion.

It was first observed that in two cases the presence of HVP favoured the cell adhesion, indicating that 

cells recognized the properties of the molecule as a chemotactic cue. But, it does not allow the creation of a 

well-defined gradient along the scaffold. The concentration of HVP should increase along the scaffold as the 

driving forces for cells to migrate and proliferate within are expected to decrease due to the restrictions imposed 

by the structure itself. Since it was not possible to prove the efficiency of this method for all layers, the desired 

gradient will be always susceptible to failure. Plasma surface treatment through APP has been demonstrated as 

a well suitable technique to develop interfaces capable to improve cell adhesion at the implant surfaces.98,99 

However, the unfavourable results can be assigned to an inaccurate surface treatment using this method. Some 

of the main factors to explain the poor cell adhesion in the bio-functionalized layers can be related to an 

inadequate selection of the PCL silanized layer, as a  result obtained from the operating parameters used in the 

APPJ, to a possible formation of a vertical multi-layering created with APTES deposited, compromising the 

silanization and leaving less functional groups to react with HVP, to the time for incubation, that may have not 

been enough for cells to detect the presence of surface chemistries and stablish interactions with them, to the 

number of cells seeded. Although, these results have given important indications point for further 

functionalization. Nevertheless, PCL layers were used to perform the assembly of the scaffold to evaluate their 

influence in cells functions and to complement, or contradict, the results described in this section. 

 

 

5.5 Cell migration into designed 3D scaffold 

To observe cell attachment and proliferation on/within the scaffolds, fluorescent images were taken on 

the 3rd day of seeding by confocal microscope immediately after fixing the cells. Both scaffolds, functionalized 

and control were investigated. Confocal microscope permits to obtain images with reduced blurring, in the 

perpendicular and parallel optical sections. Confocal microscope can penetrate the sample and scan it with a 

maximum depth of 50 ?m. The scaffold resulted in a thickness of 0.229 ± 0.005 (mm) and 0.320 ± 0.005 (mm) 

for functionalized and control, respectively. Since confocal microscope was not able to scan all the thickness of 

the matrix, was first examined the top of the scaffold (where the cells were seeded), collecting the images until 

possible depth, and then, was examined the bottom (where is supposed to start the regeneration process), until 

the depth where the presence of the first cells could be detectable. 



 

90 

 

After 3 days of seeding, the cells could migrate, at least, till a depth of 50 ?m. Functionalized scaffold 

presented, at this depth, significant cell’s populations (in green), as showed in Figure 5.8. The images were 

taken from different regions of the same xy plane. Comparing with the control scaffold, it is notable the increase 

in cell number, indicating the benefits of rhFGF in sustaining cell proliferation in the functionalized architecture. 

The presence of cells at this depth can also demonstrate and prove the existence of sufficient and interconnected 

porosity allowing cells to travel within the structure. It is important to note the presence of cells in the control 

scaffold at 40 ?m, evidencing the existence of some hydrophobic character and cell’s ability to perform their 

functions, yet narrowly, in environments with the same characteristics. 

 

While examining the bottom of the scaffold, a substantial difference in cell number could be 

distinguished. Fluorescent signals at the bottom of the scaffold were barely detectable, indicating the absence 

of cellular populations at the bottom. Images were taken along the z-axis (from bottom to top) and the first cells 

were observed at a depth of 30 ?m and 17 ?m for functionalized and control scaffolds, respectively, were scarce 

cells appeared, and the concentration of cell’s populations is practically inexistent, Figure 5.9. Morphological 

restrictions, low porosity or porosity conditioned by the insertion and immobilization of biological moieties, 

and well as inappropriate concentrations of these molecules to create the gradient, are the basic findings to 

explain the break in cell proliferation and migration. Also, the insufficient seeding period, hydrogel 

concentration, and the fact of the assembly of the scaffold had been done manually are aspects that can influence 

the migration of the cells within the structure. Cells were closer to the bottom in the scaffold for control. This 

fact does not guarantee more efficiency when compared to the functionalized scaffold, since the seeding was

functionalized scaffold, after 3 days of culture. Below, cell migration at a depth of 40 ?m in control scaffold,

done in an open petri dish and cells could have been detached from the structure and reached these regions 

through the culture medium.  

The scaffold’s thickness presents a contradictory result. It was expected a thickness in the range of 0.30 

to 0.50 mm, with a thicker structure for the functionalized scaffold. However, the assembly faced some problems 

in the stacking due to the vulnerability of the system that may had influenced the final thickness. 

 

 

When assembling, we faced two major problems: a trouble in stack the PCL bio-functionalized layers 

in the frames, and the difficulty to produce hydrogels in appropriate concentration. Hydrogel concentration was 

selected based on the experiments of Koutsopoulos, S. et al., where they studied the release kinetics for a variety 

of proteins in a wide range of molecular mass, hydrodynamic radii, and isoelectric point.100 The release studies 

consisted in the determination of the diffusion coefficients of lysozyme, trypsin inhibitor, BSA, and IgG 

presented inside a nanofibre SAP-hydrogel scaffold and released into solution, using the single-molecule 

approach. The release kinetics suggested that protein diffusion through nanofibre hydrogels depended primarily 

on the size of the protein. rhFGF and IL?6 are in the same range of molecular mass and size of the proteins used 

in this study, where the release was performed through 1% (wt/vol) peptide hydrogel. This concentration was 

adopted to build the EAK 16?II hydrogel; however, when assembling, the hydrogel formed a single dense drop 

on the PCL surfaces, which was then spread out of the matrix when the next PCL layer was placed on its top. 

In the following layers, 0.5% (wt/vol) peptide hydrogel was produced, but the material was completely absorbed 

by the PCL layers. These observations demonstrate unsuitable hydrogel concentration for incorporating the 

soluble molecules and to form interwoven nanofibre controlled structure. It was not perceptible if the failure to

bottom in the functionalized scaffold. Below, presence of cells at 17 ?m from the bottom, in the control scaffold,

obtain the hydrogel was due to its concentration, or if it is related to the concentration of the growth 

factors/inflammatory cytokines. On other hand, the problem with PCL nanofibres is due to is vulnerability to 

rupture after functionalization. As the available material was not enough to produce samples bigger than 1x1 

cm2, at this area, the samples easily bend, and it is difficult to place them straight on the frames. These problems 

directly influenced the success of the final 3D structure, and, consequently, cell migration since the layers were 

not concentric, neither intact along the scaffold. 



 

 

 

93 

 

CHAPTER 6 – CONCLUSIONS 

 
A nano-fibrous biomimetic scaffold was developed by assembling PCL nanofibres layers with 

hydrogels from self-assembling peptides into a 3D structure. PCL nanofibres were obtained by electrospinning, 

where the working parameters were studied and tuned to obtain fibres with diameters in the nano-range. Nano-

fibres with average diameter of 190 nm were obtained for a concentration of 30% of PCL in HFIP, at a flow 

rate of 0.2 mL h?1 in the presence of coaxial air flow (0.2 bar), at a tip-target distance of 30 cm. The collected 

fibres were submitted to a surface plasma treatment and the SEM analysis verified that this treatment had no 

significant effect on the PCL matrices in terms of porosity and fibre topography. However, PCL surface 

treatment by Ar-driven APP successfully resulted in a significant increase of the surface hydrophilicity, 

allowing the anchor of the bioactive molecule HVP at different concentrations. Plasma treatment improves 

osteoblast adhesion, but the different plasma treatments do not modify cell adhesion. h-osteoblast adhesion on 

the surfaces has revealed to be concentration-dependent of HVP molecules. Control and bio-functionalized 

scaffolds manifested limitations for cell migration from the top to the bottom after a super attack of 3 days. The 

introduction of chemical guidance molecules permitted a better cell proliferation in the bio-functionalized 

scaffold, where it could be seen the presence of considerable cell’s populations until a depth of 50 ?m, from the 

top to the bottom.  

It was expected to develop a novel bone substitute capable to promote osteoblasts penetration along the 

entire bony support. The experiment presented some barriers along the process, although some remarkable 

conclusions could be taken from what was investigated. First, it was confirmed the efficiency of APP as a 

successful surface plasma treatment to contradict the original hydrophobic character of PCL. This fact 

contributed to the immobilization of HVP that, even though it has not been possible to determine it precise 

concentration, was capable to enhance cell attachment for some of the treatment conditions studied. Cell 

attachment, proliferation and migration is essential for long-term success of the implant. The provided scaffold 

offered some constraints to the cell’s functions through it thickness. An excessive density of hydrogel, after 

incorporation of rhFGF was point out as one of the reasons for unaccomplished scaffold design. 

 

6.1 Future perspectives 

 Once it was not possible to demonstrate the efficiency of the designed scaffold for cell proliferation and 

migration, future studies are recommended to optimize both individual systems that constitute the idea here 

presented.  In author’s opinion, the first step should be optimizing APP parameters and perform new XPS studies 

to obtain correct silanization of the matrices, in a way to guarantee a more suitable immobilization of the 

adhesive molecules. In a first approach, plasma surface treatment seemed to enhance the surfaces capability to 

immobilize bioactive molecules, however, the silanization performed was not successful to obtain a coherent 

gradient able to be employed in the scaffold as it was firstly thought. After obtaining a coherent and efficient 



 

94 

 

gradient, biological assays should be investigated. For these studies, at least three replicates per sample should 

be done to confirm the results. The author suggests that should be created, besides a control scaffold as the one 

described, a scaffold in which was possible to investigate the influence of each single molecule, HVP, rh-FGF 

and IL-6, in the cell’s viability. The comparison of all these structures will allow to conclude about the most 

valuable cues for signalize cells and establish a more accurate regeneration process.
