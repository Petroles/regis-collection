A mistura dos derivados semissintéticos cloridrato da (–)-3-O-acetil-cassina e cloridrato da (–)-3-O-acetil-espectalina, 
preparada a partir da mistura dos alcalóides (–)-cassina e (–)-espectalina (4:1) obtida de Senna spectabilis, é um potente 
inibidor da acetilcolinesterase (AChE), assim justificando mais estudos moleculares. Neste sentido, estudos de docking 
e dinâmica moleculares foram conduzidos neste trabalho com o objetivo de adquirir uma compreensão mais profunda 
de todos os aspectos estruturais das moléculas cloridratos da (–)-3-O-acetil-cassina e (–)-3-O-acetil-espectalina, as quais 
diferem em seus potenciais inibidores de AChE. Os dois derivados em estudo apresentaram diversas interações com o 
sítio periférico aniônico dentro da cavidade catalítica de AChE de Torpedo californica. Entretanto, somente o composto 
majoritário (–)-3-O-acetil-cassina mostrou interação com a tríade catalítica de maneira significativa. As simulações de 
dinâmica molecular utilizando água como solvente foram importantes para compreender as interações hipotéticas entre 
cloridratos da (–)-3-O-acetil-cassina e (–)-3-O-acetil-espectalina com AChE. Os dados obtidos indicam que o composto 
(–)-3-O-acetil-cassina é o inibidor da enzima mais potente possivelmente devido às suas interações favoráveis com a 
proteína, com menor custo de dessolvatação. Estes resultados sugerem que o tamanho da cadeia lateral influencia no 
potencial inibitório das moléculas avaliadas e podem representar o ponto de partida para o desenvolvimento de novos 
derivados de (–)-3-O-acetil-cassina, objetivando a descoberta de inibidores de AChE mais eficazes.

The mixture of semi-synthetic derivatives (–)-3-O-acetyl-cassine hydrochloride and (–)-3-O-acetyl-spectaline 
hydrochloride, prepared from the mixture of natural alkaloids (–)-cassine and (–)-spectaline (4:1) isolated from Senna 
spectabilis, has been shown to be a potent acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor, thereby prompting further molecular 
studies. In this sense, docking and dynamic molecular studies were carried out in this work, aiming to acquire a deeper 
understanding about all the structural aspects of molecules (–)-3-O-acetyl-cassine and (–)-3-O-acetyl-spectaline 
hydrochlorides, which differ with respect to their AChE inhibitory potentials. Both molecules establish important interactions 
with the peripheral anionic site within the catalytic gorge of Torpedo californica AChE. However, only the major compound 
(–)-3-O-acetyl-cassine hydrochloride significantly interacts with the catalytic triad. Explicit-solvent molecular dynamic 
simulations were conducted in order to gain better understanding about the hypothetical interactions taking place between 
the semi-synthetic alkaloid molecules (–)-3-O-acetyl-cassine and (–)-3-O-acetyl-spectaline hydrochlorides and AChE. 
The data obtained in this study indicated that (–)-3-O-acetyl-cassine hydrochloride is the most potent inhibitor of AChE 
possibly due to the favorable interactions of this molecule with the target protein, with lower desolvation cost. These 
results suggested that the size of the side chain has an effect on the inhibitory potential of the evaluated molecules and 
may represent the starting point for the development of new derivatives of (–)-3-O-acetyl-cassine hydrochloride, with a 
view to the discovery of new effective AChE inhibitors.

Introduction

A l z h e i m e r ’s  d i s e a s e  ( A D )  i s  a  l a t e - o n s e t 
neurodegenerative pathology that affects the memory, 
motor coordination, and cognition in a progressive, and 
eventually lethal, manner.1-3 It has been postulated that at 
least some of the cognitive impairment experienced by 
AD patients results from deficient acetylcholine levels and 
consequent reduction in cholinergic neurotransmission. 
Consequently, the key approach employed in the 
development of drugs for use in the symptomatic treatment 
of AD has targeted the cholinergic deficit. Currently, only 
five drugs have received approval in the USA and Europe 
for therapeutic use in AD, namely tacrine (1; Cognex™),4 
donepezil (2; Aricept™),5 rivastigmine (3; Excelon™),6 
galantamine (4; Reminyl™)7 and memantine (5; Ebixa™)8 
(Figure 1). All of these compounds are acetylcholinesterase 
inhibitors (AChEIs),4-7 with the single exception of 5, 
which acts by blocking the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) 
glutamate receptors. It is apparent, therefore, that inhibition 
of acetylcholinesterase remains an important therapeutic 
strategy to the palliate cognitive deficit in AD.

The screening of numerous plant species that were 
typically selected based on their ethnobotanical data 
or report of their popular uses has been carried out in 
order to discover anticholinesterasic compounds with 
novel structural entities.9-18 In this context, flowers, 
fruits, leaves and seeds from the ornamental plant 
Senna spectabilis (syn. Cassia spectabilis) (Fabaceae) have 
been reported to be sources of biologically rare piperidine 
alkaloids.19 A deep analysis of the structural features of the 
naturally-occurring (–)-3-O-acetyl-spectaline (6) identified 
that part of this compound contains a molecular fragment 
similar to acetylcholine (ACh) (Figure 2). This has led to the 
preparation of several semi-synthetic derivatives, including 

(–)-3-O-acetyl-spectaline hydrochloride (10), which 
was prepared from natural piperidine (–)-spectaline (8). 
This derivative has been shown to display both in vitro 
(inhibitory concentration (IC50) = 7.32 µM) and in vivo 
cholinergic activity during the spatial memory test 
(water maze).20 Aiming to elucidate the mechanism of 
cholinesterase inhibition followed by this derivative, 
kinetic studies have revealed noncompetitive cholinesterase 
inhibition and central nervous selectivity with few peripheral  
side effects.21

Considering these results, compound 10 was selected 
as a prototype for further studies aiming to achieve 
a lead molecule. Additional scale-up fractionation of 
S. spectabilis and further isolation of the natural alkaloid 
8 were monitored by electrospray ionization mass 
spectrometry (ESI-MS). This investigation revealed that 
the previously published piperidine alkaloids were in fact 
mixtures of two homologous piperidine alkaloid isomers 
(–)-cassine (7) and (–)-spectaline (8) at a ratio of 4:1, 
respectively (Figure 2).22 So, the cholinesterase inhibition 
properties identified in that study were due to the mixture 
of (–)-3-O-acetyl-cassine hydrochloride (9) and 10 instead 
of being due to only the latter compound.

In spite of this problem, the main aim of this 
study was to investigate the binding patterns of the 
derivatives 9 and 10 with AChE and to verify the possible 
differences in their inhibition profiles. Molecular 
modeling studies of complexes formed between Torpedo 
californica acetylcholinesterase (TcAChE) and the target 
semi-synthetic AChE inhibitors were accomplished by 
the application of flexible docking methodologies. The 
docking complexes were also submitted to explicit-solvent 
molecular dynamic (MD) simulations in water in order to 
gain dynamic understanding of the hypothetic interactions 
taking place between the molecules and AChE.

A considerable amount of data related to the crystal 
structure of AChE and to various AChEI complexes is 
available.23-25 With information, it is possible to apply 
molecular modeling methods to gain insight into the 
mechanism of action of the enzyme and to investigate 
the molecular determinants that modulate the molecular 
recognition of AChE inhibitors. Such knowledge can be 
exploited during the design of novel AChE inhibitors that 
might be more effective in the treatment of AD.26-30

Methodology

Molecular docking analyses

The accurate prediction of protein-ligand interaction 
geometries is essential for the success of the virtual-screening 
approaches employed during structure-based drug design. 
This procedure requires docking tools that are able to 
generate suitable conformations of a ligand within a 
protein-binding site and demands reliable energetic 
evaluations for the quality determination of the interaction. 
In this respect, the FlexXTM scoring function has been 
shown to be reliable in a variety of different cases, even 
when flexible ligands are concerned.31 Thus, in the present 
study, docking with FlexE was performed using the default 
FlexXTM scoring function following the preparation of both 
the ligand and the protein.

Molecular docking analyses were accomplished by 
using the SYBYL 9 (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA) 
version 7.2 software and the programs embedded therein. 
Formal charges were assigned, and the FlexX scoring 
function31 was chosen for computation of the FlexE32 
docking poses.

Preparation of ligands for the docking studies

Ligand coordinates were generated using the sketcher 
tool embedded in the SYBYL software suite, and the 
correct atom types (including hybridization states) and 
bond categories were defined. Hydrogen atoms were 
subsequently added, Gasteiger-Hückel charges33 were 
assigned to each atom, and the final structures were 
energy-minimized. Carboxylic acid groups were modeled 
in their anionic form, whereas amino groups were 
considered in their protonated form.

Preparation of protein structures for the docking studies

Three-dimensional crystal structures of TcAChE 
complexed with huperzine, tacrine and donepezil were 
retrieved from the RCSB (Research Collaboratory for 
Structural Bioinformatics) protein data bank34 under 
PDB IDs 1VOT, 1ACJ and 1EVE, respectively. The active 
site of TcAChE was defined as the collection of residues 
within 15.0 Å of the bound inhibitor present in the reference 
structure 1ACJ. The bound inhibitors were not included in 
the docking runs.

For each structure, the description of an ensemble 
contains the definition of the protein atoms (via chain 
identifiers and hetero groups), the resolution of ambiguities in 
the PDB file (alternate location indicators etc.), the location 
of hydrogen atoms at the heteroatoms and the definition 
of the active site atoms. The first step in the generation of 
suitable protein structures for ensemble superimposition 
is the selection of one chain from the reference crystal 
structure (1ACJ). This process generally involves retention 
of chain A and deletion of other chains, if present.

Stepwise analysis and correction of the geometric 
parameters, including atom types, atom names, torsion 
angles, bump elimination and hydrogen addition, were 
carried out with the aid of the Biopolymer “protein 
preparation” tool embedded in the SYBYL software suite. 
The assignment of the hydrogen positions was based on 
default rules, except for the definition of the torsion angles 
at the hydroxyl groups of the amino acid residues serine, 
threonine and tyrosine, and the hydrogen position inside 
the histidine side chain. Charges were added according to 
the AmberF99 force field simulation.35 The side-chains 
of lysine and arginine, and the carboxylate groups of 
aspartic and glutamic acids, were modeled in their ionized 
states. Water molecules contained in the PDB file were 
removed. After each docking run, thirty poses were saved 
in Mol2 files for further analysis.

Ligand topologies

The structure of each compound was submitted to the 
PRODRG Server,36 and the initial geometries and crude 
topologies were retrieved on the basis of the best ranking 
docking poses previously obtained by flexible docking with 
FlexE. The employed atomic charges were derived from 
the Löwdin scheme and were obtained at the HF/6-31G** 
level using the program GAMESS37 in an appropriated 
form for molecular dynamic calculations. Analyses were 
carried out using the GROMACS simulation suite38 and 
the GROMOS96 force field, as previously reported.39-41

Molecular dynamic simulations

Three systems were submitted to molecular dynamic 
(MD) simulations: (i) uncomplexed AChE in solution, 
(ii) AChE complexed with 9 and (iii) AChE complexed with 
10. The GROMACS simulations suite and GROMOS96 
force field were used by employing an MD protocol based 
on previous studies.42 Briefly, these systems were solvated 
in triclinic boxes using periodic boundary conditions and 
the SPC water model.43 Counter ions were added, so 
as to neutralize the charges of the systems. The LINCS 
method44 was applied in order to constrain covalent bond 
lengths. This allowed for an integration step of 2 fs after an 
initial energy minimization step using the steepest descent 
algorithm. Electrostatic interactions were calculated with 
particle-mesh Ewald.45 Temperature and pressure were kept 
constant by separately coupling protein, ligand, ions, and 
solvent to external temperature and pressure baths with 
constants of ? = 0.1 and 0.5 ps, respectively.46 The system 
was slowly heated from 50 to 310 K in steps of 5 ps, each 
one increasing the reference temperature by 50 K. After this 

thermalization, the reference temperature was maintained 
at 310 K. Interaction energies are presented as the sum 
of Coulomb and Lennard-Jones components over the 
entire MD trajectories. Ranked data were evaluated using 
Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA),47 
whereas pairwise multiple comparisons were assessed 
by the Tukey test.48 Between-group comparisons were 
appraised with the Mann-Whitney rank sum test.49,50

Results and Discussion

Enzyme-inhibitor interactions at the bottom of the AChE 
gorge

The visual inspection of the ligand-TcAChE complexes 
(Figures 3a-b) shows that the bottom of the active site gorge 
of AChE may be represented by amino acid residue Trp84. 
The evaluation of the best ranking docking poses obtained 
for 9 and 10 revealed that neither of these molecules was

able to penetrate deeply into the enzyme gorge. Presumably, 
this is a consequence of the volume of the long aliphatic 
side chains present in the two compounds. However, unlike 
its homologue 10, acetyl hydrochloride derivative 9 was 
able to interact with one of the residues, hence forming 
the AChE catalytic triad (i.e., Ser200, Glu327 and His440) 
through formation of a hydrogen bond linking the terminal 
oxygen atom of its acetyl group with Ser200.

Enzyme-inhibitor interactions in the middle of the AChE 
gorge

A constriction is located within the region considered 
to be the middle of the AChE active site gorge and is 
represented by amino acid residue Phe330 (Figures 3a-b). 
However, neither 9 nor 10 appear to interact with Phe330, 
although a binding site with 9 is located relatively close to 
this residue (Figure 3a).

Enzyme-inhibitor interactions at the entrance to the AChE 
gorge

Amino acid residues, including Tyr70, Tyr121 and 
Trp279, making up the peripheral anionic site of AChE 
are located close to the top of the active site gorge. The 
visual inspection of the top scoring pose of 9 reveals that 
the piperidine ring and the aromatic rings of Phe288 and 
Phe290 are within van der Waals contact distance 
(Figure 3a). Additionally, 9 is able to form hydrogen bonds 
with the –NH group of Phe288 via the ester function, 
with Gly118, Gly119 and Ala201 via the oxygen of the 
terminal acetyl group, and with Tyr121 via the hydrogen 
atom associated with the protonated amino group of the 
piperidine moiety (Figure 3a). In contrast, 10 can establish 
hydrogen bonds with Lys341 via the ester function, with 
Pro76 via the protonated nitrogen atom of the piperidine 
ring, and with Asn85 via the terminal acetyl group. It is 
noteworthy that, as compared to 9, 10 binds to AChE in 
a perpendicular fashion, with an extended conformation 
(Figures 3a-b). Binding of compounds 9 and 10 to the 
peripheral anionic site of AChE is likely to generate a steric 
blockade of the enzyme gorge similar to that described 
for the anticholinesterasic drug donepezil, which presents 
analogous binding characteristics.25

Molecular dynamics stimulations

In order to obtain further information regarding the 
dynamics of AChE inhibition by 9 and 10, complexes 
between the enzyme and the semi-synthetic derivatives 
were submitted to MD simulations in water. Figures 4a-b 

show the docking-obtained orientations of each compound 
superimposed on the respective 5 ns MD simulations, 
while Figure 4c depicts the 5 ns MD simulations of 9 and

10 superimposed one upon the other. Both compounds 
underwent significant reorientations in the simulated time 
scale, indicating an important role for the solvent with 
respect to the flexibility and stabilization of the complexes. 
However, such conformational accommodations did not 
appear to induce major modification in AChE dynamics or 
secondary structural elements (Supplementary Information, 
data available).

MD simulation revealed interactions between both 
molecules 9 and 10 and the amino acid residue Trp84 at the 
bottom of the enzyme gorge, although the binding energy of 
9 with this residue (–7.7 ± 6.5 kJ mol-1) was more favorable 
than that of 10 (–1.9 ± 2.6 kJ mol-1) (Table 1). In the middle 
of the gorge, both 9 and 10 interacted with Trp432, which 
lies in a region close to the amino acid residue Phe330. At 
the top of the gorge, 9 exhibited binding with Tyr70 and 
Asp72, and exhibited a very favorable interaction with the 
latter residue with a binding energy of –13.7 ± 10.0 kJ mol-1. 
Close to this region of the gorge, derivative 9 also interacted 
with Tyr121 and Ser122. Although 10 did not bind with these 
residues, it interacts with residues Gln74, Asp285, Ser286, 
Arg289, Tyr334 and Gly335 (Table 1).

In view of the considerable flexibility shown by the 
AChE inhibitors, molecules 9 and 10 were also submitted 
to MD simulation on a 0.1 µs time scale in the presence 
of water but without the target protein (Figure 5). The 
data suggest that the increase in hydrophobicity of 10 
as compared to 9 culminates in a greater entropic cost 
associated with the complexation of the former.

MD simulation of the AChE-inhibitor docking 
complexes AChE-9 and AChE-10 generated interaction 
energies of –34.0 ± 15.1 and –30.9 ± 17.7 kJ mol-1, 
respectively (Table 1). The application of the Mann-Whitney 
rank sum test established that these values are statistically 
different (p ? 0.001), a result that correlates with the 
observed differences in the biological activities of 9 and 
10. Similarly, the observed interaction energies between 
uncomplexed 9 and 10 and solvent water may be readily 
related to the enthalpic cost of desolvation associated 
with inhibition of AChE by these molecules. Therefore, 
the more active structure 9 may be seen as presenting a 
more favorable interaction with the target protein and as 
being held with lower intensity by the solvent. On the other 
hand, the less active compound 10 exhibits a less favorable 
interaction with the target receptor and a more intense 
interaction with the solvent.

Conclusions

The molecular modeling study described herein was 
carried out with the aim of elucidating the molecular 
basis of the differential AChE inhibition profiles of 
two semi-synthetic acetyl derivatives of the piperidine 
alkaloids (–)-cassine and (–)-spectaline isolated from 
S. spectabilis. Flexible docking revealed different binding 
conformations and interaction patterns for (–)-3-O-acetyl-
cassine hydrochloride (9) and (–)-3-O-acetyl-spectaline 
hydrochloride (10) with respect to AChE, especially in 
the peripheral anionic site. Explicit-solvent molecular 
dynamic simulations in water revealed that the more active 
compound 9 presents a more favorable interaction with 
the target protein, as anticipated by flexible docking, at a 
lower desolvation cost. On the other hand, the less active 
compound 10 exhibits a less favorable interaction with 
the enzyme along with a more intense interaction with the 
solvent. These results emphasize the importance of the 
shorter side chain of 9 for a better interaction with AChE. 
This is due to reduced steric limitations to the entry of the 
inhibitor into the active site gorge. This finding will be 
able to guide the design of new derivatives of 9, e.g., via 
shortening of the side chain bearing different functionalities, 
aiming at the synthesis of anti-Alzheimer lead compounds 
based on natural products from our Brazilian biodiversity.
