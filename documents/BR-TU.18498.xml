Sumário 
 

 

As comunicações sem fios experimentaram um crescimento 
excepcional nas últimas décadas e que se prevê que continue nos próximos 
anos (Capítulo 1, Referêcia 3) Com este crescimento há uma procura 
crescente de dispositivos de menores dimensões e mais versáteis, do que os 
actualmente existentes, que permitam maiores níveis de integração, 
possibilidade de operação a altas frequências e produção a custos reduzidos. 
Actualmente existe também a necessidade de desenvolver materiais com 
permitividade dieléctrica relativa (?r) entre 40 - 80, baixas perdas dieléctricas e 
coeficiente de temperatura da frequência de ressonância (tf) próximo de zero. 
Actividades de investigação e desenvolvimento para explorar a utilização de 
tecnologias de fabrico de filmes finos e espessos para substituir os materiais 
cerâmicos em uso corrente, estão actualmente em curso. 

Neste contexto, foi explorada no presente trabalho a fabricação de 
filmes espessos por deposição electroforética (EPD) do composto BaLa4Ti4O15 
(BLT), cuja selecção se relaciona com as óptimas propriedades que apresenta 
para aplicação às frequências das microondas. Foi igualmente tentada a 
preparação de filmes espessos compósitos de BaLa4Ti4O15 (BLT) - 
Ba4Nd9.33Ti18O54 (BNT) para preenchimento do intervalo existente em termos de 
materiais com permitividades dieléctricas 40-80. A escolha da deposição 
electroforética de entre os vários processos de fabricação de filmes espessos 
prende-se com as características únicas desta técnica, nomedamente, elevada 
flexibilidade e simplicidade para aplicação a vários materiais e combinação de 
materiais, possibilidade de aplicação a uma gama variada de formas e 
estruturas tridimensionais complexas, densas e porosas e a capacidade de ser 
utilizada à escala industrial a baixos custos. 
Neste trabalho foi seguida uma aproximação sistemática para a fabricação dos 
filmes espessos compósitos pr EPD. Primeiramente procedeu-se à síntese de 
pós monofásicos de  BLT e BNT pelo processo convencional de reacção no 
estado sólido e a sua pureza foi confirmada por análises de Difracção de Raios 
X. O tamanho e distribuição de tamanho e a morfologia dos pós de BLT e BNT 
foram caracterizados por recurso a técnicas de determinação de tamanho de 
partícula e microscopia electrónica de varrimento. De seguida foram 
preparadas suspensões dos pós de BNT e BLT em diferentes meios 
suspensores, como água, etanol e trietanolamina. Ao mesmo tempo, foi 
estudada a estabilidade das suspensões por análises de tamanho de partícula 
e  

  

 



 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

  
 

 
 

 

 
medidas de transmitância de luz UV. As suspensões com estabilidade 
optimizada foram utilizadas para deposição de filmes espessos, em meio 
básico e meio ácido e foram estudadas as variáveis de processamento, como 
espessura, massa do depósito, corrente eléctrica em função do tempo e 
voltagem. Foi também discutido o efeito do passo de prensagem isostática, 
após deposição, na morfologia e densidade dos filmes e também na sua 
resposta dieléctrica. 

Filmes de BLT de 10 mm de espessura depositados sobre folhas de 
platina e sinterizados a 1600ºC/1h exibem ?r = 58, TC?r +30ppm/ºC e perda 
dieléctrica de 0.002 a 1 MHz. Como termo de comparação foram preparados 
cerâmicos de BLT. Foi feita a caracterização estrutural, microestrutural e 
dieléctrica de filmes e cerâmicos de BLT, sinterizados entre 1400ºC e 1600ºC. 

Filmes espessos compósitos de BNT/BLT e BLT/BNT foram 
preparados com sucesso por EPD. Através da combinação de camadas de 
BLT e BNT foram preparados filmes espessos compósitos de 30 µm com ?r 
~71, TC?r ~-16ppm/ºC e perda dieléctrica de a 1 MHz. Estes resultados são de 
particular relevância visto que combinam a possibilidade de preparar filmes 
espessos com propriedades desenhadas para aplicações a frequências 
elevadas e das microondas com a capacidade de diminuir o tamanho do 
dispositivo. Embora preliminares estes resultados abrem novas oportunidades 
tecnológicas, que deverão ser mais exploradas.

abstract 

 
Wireless communications have experienced an exceptional growth in 

the last decades and similar growth is expected for next coming years, 
according to the ABI analysis [Chapter 1, Reference 3]. With this growth there is 
an increase demand for the production of devices of smaller dimensions and 
more flexible than the current in use ones, with increased integration, possibility 
of operation at high frequencies and produced with reduced costs. There is also 
a present demand to develop materials with relative permittivity (?r) between 40 
- 80, low loss and near zero temperature coefficient of resonant frequency (tf). 
Research activities to exploit thin and thick film technologies to replace the bulk 
ceramics are currently underway. 

Within this context, in this work, the fabrication of thick films by 
electrophoretic deposition of the tertiary compound BaLa4Ti4O15 (BLT) was 
exploited, because of the optimal properties for microwave applications of BLT. 
Simultaneously, the preparation of BaLa4Ti4O15 (BLT) - Ba4Nd9.33Ti18O54 (BNT) 
composite thick films was attempted to fill the permittivity gap of 40-80 as 
describe above. The choice of electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique over 
other thick film processing techniques is obvious because of its unique features, 
such as the high flexibility and simplicity for application with various materials 
and combinations of materials, and on a wide range of shapes and 3D complex 
and porous structures, and its ability to be scaled-up to the fabrication of large 
product volumes and sizes at low costs.  
A systematic approach was used to fabricate the composite thick films. Firstly, 
BLT and BNT powders were prepared by solid state reaction synthesis and the 
phase purity of the powders was confirmed by XRD. The size and morphology 
of the powders were assessed by particle size analysis and scanning electron 
microscopy. BNT and BLT suspensions were prepared in different suspension 
media such as water, ethanol and acetone. The pH of the suspension was 
varied by dilute nitric acid and triethanolamine. Concomitantly the stability of the 
suspensions was characterised by particle size analysis and UV transmittance 
measurements. Stable suspensions were used for the deposition of particles in 
acidic and basic conditions, and the processing parameters such as thickness, 
deposit weight, current as a function of time and voltage were studied. The 
effect of iso static pressing and film thickness on the properties and morphology 
was also discussed. 

 



 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

  

  

 10 mm thick BLT films on platinum foils and sintered at 1600ºC/1h 
exhibit ?r = 58, TC?r +30ppm/ºC and loss tangent 0.002 at 1 MHz. As a 
comparison tool, BLT ceramics were prepared as well. Films and ceramics 
were sintered between 1400ºC to 1600ºC and their morphology and dielectric 
response assessed.  
  BNT/BLT and BLT/BNT composite thick films were successfully 
prepared by electrophoretic deposition. By the combination of BLT and BNT 
layers a 30 µm composite thick film with ?r ~71, TC?r ~-16ppm/ºC and loss 
tangent of 0.002 at 1 MHz were prepared. These results are of particular 
relevance since they combine the possibility to prepare thick films with tailored 
properties for high frequency and microwave properties with the aptitude to 
decrease the device size. Although preliminary these results open further 
technological opportunities, that should be more explored

Introduction to Microwave Dielectrics 

 

Abstract:  

Microwave (MW) dielectrics are playing an important role in the wireless communication 

in the form of microwave devices such as resonator, filter and antennas. Microwave 

devices have application in terminals, base station, satellite and mobile phones. With the 

growth of telecommunication, demand is also increased for material with higher relative 

permittivity for miniaturization of the existing devices. 

 This chapter reviews the sequential evaluation of the dielectric ceramics and the 

properties to the corresponding materials. BaO-R2O3-TiO2(BRT) (R = rare earth element) 

system belong  to the family of high relative permittivity materials with low losses and 

show the potential to scaled down the existing microwave devices in thick film. From BRT 

family the two compounds selected for this studies are Ba4Nd9.33Ti18O54(BNT) and 

BaLa4Ti4O15 (BLT). The literature review of these compounds are illustrated and chapter 

ends with the description of microwave material application  

 

1.1 Introduction  

The term microwave refers to electromagnetic energy having a frequency higher 

than 1 gigahertz (billions of cycles per second) and materials which shows resonance at 

this frequency are known as microwave resonators. Microwave signals propagate in 

straight lines and they are not or very little affected by troposphere, ionized regions in the 

upper atmosphere and barriers such as hills, mountains, and large human-made structures. 

 

Most microwave systems operate in the 300 MHz to 30 GHz range of frequency in 

electromagnetic (EM) spectrum. For telecommunications, the most important markets are 

ultra-high frequency TV broadcasting (470 - 870MHz), satellite TV broadcasting (4 GHz) 

and the mobile phone network (900 MHz - 1800 MHz) [1]. In terms of devices, the 

microwave market is dominated by the bulky invar coaxial and cavity resonators which 

have 3 times lower cost then neodymium (Nd) and tantalum (Ta) based ceramics. 

Neodymium and tantalum based resonators are used where high quality factor (Qf) is 



2 

 

needed. In the last three decades, the discovery and development of the 

telecommunications and associated devices created a new era to ceramics and in particular 

to dielectric ceramics which have edge on the bulky metal resonators because of there low 

weight and possibility of miniaturisation. Today, dielectric ceramics are having key 

applications in resonators, filters and other components in microwave communication 

systems. Still there are various challenges for the new generation of microwave ceramics to 

be achieve, namely to reduce dielectric losses, to optimise the device design, to reduce the 

size (miniaturization) and to further lower the cost of ceramics resonators and filters. 

  

The global market for the dielectric ceramics is of the order of $400 million; while 

the markets for the resulting devices and components, and for the end-user systems, are 

~10 and ~100 times that size, respectively [2]. At the time of economic recession the only 

sector which is untouched by recession is telecommunication. A recent survey by ABI 

Research has predicted that mobile services revenues will continue to grow at nearly 1.2% 

through 2014 (Figure 1-1) [3].

At the present, commercial microwave ceramics fall into two main categories: (i) 

ceramics with low dielectric permittivity, ?r  (20 &amp;lt;?r &amp;lt;45) and quality factor (Qf) 

(100,000-20,000GHz) and (ii) ceramics with high ?r (&gt;80) and moderate quality factor (Qf) 

(10,000GHz) [1].  

 

The three main prerequisites which make dielectric ceramic materials suitable for 

the microwave applications are: 

? High Quality factor (Qf) or low dielectric loss (tan ?) 

? High relative permittivity (?r ) 

? Near zero Temperature coefficient of thermal stability (tf) 

 

1.1.1 Relative Permittivity 

Permittivity is a physical quantity that describes how an electric field affects, and is 

affected by a dielectric medium, and is determined by the ability of a material to polarize 

in response to the field, and thereby reduce the total electric field inside the material [4]. 

 

The overall net polarization experienced in a material, P, creates a dipole moment 

which augments the total displacement flux of dipoles, D. Thus, 

                                                           D = ?0 E+ P                                                        (1-1) 

where E stands for the applied field and ?0 for the permittivity of free-space. And the net 

polarization can be written in terms of the susceptibility, ?, 

                                                           P = ?0 ? E                                                         (1-2) 

thus the relative permittivity can be defined in terms of the susceptibility that is directly 

related to the polarization mechanisms in a material: 

                                                         D = ?0 (1+?) E= ?r ?0 E                                       (1-3) 

where 

                                                        ?r = 
0

?

?
 = relative permittivity                           (1-4) 

 

The relative permittivity, ?r, is then the ratio of the natural permittivity of the 

material (?) to the permittivity of free-space (?0). The permittivity, ?, is considered to be a 



4 

 

direct measure of the polarizability of a material and will govern both the phase variation 

and attenuation of an imposed field to the material. Thus, the permittivity, ?, is a complex 

quantity with both real and imaginary parts and can be written as, 

                                                          ? = ?
? 
+ j ?

?
                                                  (1-5) 

the real part of the relative permittivity, ?
?
, is termed the dielectric constant and is 

determined by the magnitude of P. It defines the amount of electrostatic energy stored per 

unit volume in a material for a given applied field, i.e. the amount of charge stored in a 

capacitor. The imaginary component of the permittivity, ?
?
, is called the loss factor and is 

governed by the lag in polarization upon application of the field and the energy dissipation 

associated with charge polarization. It represents the energy loss in a material; j is a 

complex number [5].  

 

 A high relative permittivity is desirable for circuit miniaturisation, because 

diameter of dielectric component is inversely proportional to the square root of its relative 

permittivity, so higher the permittivity smaller the size of microwave resonator. 

                                                        d=?0?

where d stands for the diameter of the dielectric component, and ?0 for the wavelength at 

the resonant frequency [6]. As a consequence, the size reduction of a dielectric component 

requires materials with a high relative permittivity.  

 

1.1.2 Loss Tangent 

 The loss tangent, tan?, relates to the electrical losses in the material and is given by: 

 

                                                      
?

?tan                              (1-7) 

where ? stands for loss angle, ? ?? for the energy loss and ?? for the stored energy. In terms 

of an electrical circuit, tan? represents the resistive part of the impedance and is directly 

proportional to the electrical conductivity [4].  

The quality factor, Q is defined by: 

                                             Q = 1/tan ?                                                         (1-8)  



5 

 

and it is a measure of the efficiency or power-loss of a microwave system. This definition 

is not particularly useful for visualizalizing how Q relates to microwave communication. 

More succinctly, it is determined experimentally at the resonance frequency (fo) divided by 

the bandwidth, (?fo), measured at 3dB below the maximum height at resonance [7]. Q is a 

measure of the selectivity of the resonator to a given frequency. Higher Q means a narrow 

peak which results in reduced risk of cross-talk within a given frequency range, which in 

turn gives high selectivity to a given frequency and therefore increase the density of 

channels in a given frequency band. Losses normally increase with increasing frequency; 

therefore Q is also frequency dependent. The relation between the two, Qf, where f is the 

measured frequency is always constant so, Qf values are quoted when comparing low loss 

(high Q) dielectric microwave ceramics [7].  

 

1.1.3 Temperature Coefficient of Resonant Frequency (tf) 

The temperature coefficient of resonance frequency (tf) is the parameter which 

characterises the thermal stability of the material. It measures the ?drift? with respect to the 

temperature of the resonant frequency [4]. 

                                                      tf = 
0

f

f?

                            (1-9) 

where f0 stands for the resonant frequency at ambient temperature and ?f for the frequency 

variation among the temperature range ?T.  Conventionally, tf specifies the resonant 

frequency change in parts per million per degrees centigrade (ppm/
o
C). The poor 

temperature stability would cause the in and out drift of resonance of the carrier signal 

during hot and cold days. The practical requirement is that for a temperature ranging 

between -40ºC and 100º, tf should vary less then 10ppm/ºC [8]. 

 

Temperature coefficient of resonant frequency (tf) is related with the temperature 

coefficient of the dielectric constant, TC?r, by the following relation:  

                                                       tf = -1/2 TC?r – ?                                                (1-10)  

 

 where ? stands for the thermal expansion coefficient of the material [9]. TC?r describes the 

maximum change in relative permittivity over a specified temperature range. tf is 



6 

 

depending on the TC?r, which is typically reported between -2000 to 2000 ppm/ºC in 

dielectric materials [8]. This is the stringent restriction for the material with higher 

dielectric constant to be used for microwave systems. Wersing [6] related the TC?r with 

polarizability and further with the structure to give a clear picture of the TC?r variation in 

different structures and conditions. The large TC?r of diatomic alkali halide is obviously 

caused by the strong increase of the ionic polarization with volume and by the large 

thermal expansion with the increase of the temperature. In materials with more 

complicated structures, BaMg1/3Ta2/3O3, BaZn1/3Ta1/3O3, the additional ionic polarizability 

not only raises permittivity but also shifts TC?r to negative values. Both strong electronic 

and ionic polarizabilities also give rise to a softening of the lattice modes, thus the 

anharmonic contribution to TC?r increases and makes TC?r even more negative. This 

decrease of TC?r with increasing permittivity is consistent with the behaviour of 

paraelectrics [6]. 

 

1.2 Important Groups of Microwave Ceramics 

Microwave dielectric ceramics are characterized by high ?r, low loss (high Q), and 

near zero tf, making them attractive as electronic components in microwave applications, 

as mentioned previously. In the mid-1960s, Cohn and his co-workers performed the first 

extensive theoretical and experimental evaluation of the low loss dielectric resonators [10], 

based on rutile (TiO2) ceramics. The poor temperature stability of rutile dielectrics 

prevented the development of practical components for commercial applications. A real 

breakthrough occurred in the earlies 1970s when BaTi4O9 based ceramics full filled the 

technical requirement, with ?r ~38, tf =15ppm/ºC. and Q=5000 at 2GHz [11]. Later, a 

modified Ba2Ti9O20 with improved performance was reported by Bell Laboratories having 

?r ~40, tf = 2 ppm/ºC and Q= 15000 at 2GHz [10]. The next major breakthrough came from 

Japan when the Murata Manufacturing Company produced (Zr0.8Sn0.2)TiO4 ceramics [12-

13-14], which offers adjustable compositions so that the temperature coefficient could be 

varied between 10 to 12 ppm/°C. A list of important groups of dielectrics and their 

properties is tabulated in Table 1-1.

The commercially available microwave ceramic compounds generally categories in 

to two groups; titanium based and tantalum based. Table 1-2 summarises the dielectric 

properties of commercial available microwave resonators for MW Ceramics with almost 

zero tf. CaTiO3-NdAlO3 (CTNA) and ZrTiO4-ZnNd2O6 (ZNZN)- based ceramics are 

dominating the base station market. Ba(Co,Zn)1/3Nd2/3O3(BCZN)-based ceramics are the 

most cheapest material for MW cavity resonators with high Qf of 90 000 [7]. Tantalum 

based compounds are used when there is the need of high Qf materials.  Ba(Mg1/3 Ta2/3)O3 

(BMT) and Ba(Zn1/3 Ta2/3)O3 are mainly used in satellites where selectivity to a given 

frequency is paramount. The presence of Ta makes this compound very costly for 

applications. The researchers are currently working on understanding the role of Ta, so that 

it could be replaced by low cost material. The ceramics based on Nd2O3 (or La2O3), BaO 

and TiO2 were already quite common for capacitors with an almost temperature 

independent capacitance and now found importance in microwave application; they are 

known to be ´high ?r´ microwave ceramics [6]. Within this family Ba4Nd9.33Ti18O54 (BNT) 

compound has a tungsten bronze structure with high permittivity of 80 and is commercially 

used as digital television receiver and could be used as dielectric resonator antennas and 

coaxial line resonator where Q is dominated by the metallization. Two decades ago, the 

BanLa4Ti3+nO12+3n (BLT) homologous series was found near the Ba6-3x.R8+2xTi18O54(R= 

rare Earth). In this series the compound BaLa4Ti4O15 (BLT, n=1) has high relative 

permittivity ~44, with high Qf 47 000 GHz and tf near to zero (-2ppm/ºC). This material 

has optimal properties to be used as in telecommunication base stations. 

 

In this work, the fabrication and properties of BNT and BLT dielectric thick films 

and thick film composite were exploited and it was verified that thick films present optimal 



8 

 

properties to be used as antennas, filters and other microwave application, in which 

miniaturization is required.

1.3 BaO-Nd2O3-TiO2 (BNT)  

Interest has spread quickly to rare earth elements, BaO-R2O3-TiO2 systems (R = 

rare earth, such as La, Sm, Nd, Pr), due to their high permittivity which makes possible for 

the size reduction. At the present the only commercially available group of high relative 

permittivity microwave materials were ceramics based on BRT solid solutions with 

relative permittivity ranging from 80 to 90. BaO-Nd2O3-TiO2 (BNT) system stands out and 

has attracted the interest of researchers and industrialists due to its high relative 

permittivity. The earliest works on these systems are credited to Bolton [15] and Kolar et 

al. [16-17].  

 

Kolar et al. [17] estimated the ternary compound BaO.R2O3.4TiO2 as 

BaO.R2O3.5TiO2. Later, Takahashi et al. [18-19] used the more precise co-precipitation 

method to synthesise the tertiary compound and based on X-ray, TEM and Raman 

spectroscopy analysis the authors proposed a corrected composition as BaO.R2O3.4TiO2 (R 

= La, Nd, Sm and Pr) which confirmed the earlier results of Razagon et al. [20,21] and 

Matveeva et al. [22].

Later, Ohsato et al. [23] reported the structure of this compound, is a new 

pervoskite like column which has 2X2 unit cell of pervoskite. The crystal structure of BNT 

compounds essentially consists of a three-dimensional framework of corner-sharing 

pervoskite-like octahedra joined together according to a pattern similar to that of the 

tetragonal tungsten bronzes. The structure is typified by oxygen octahedra linked at the 

corners in a complex way to yield three types of channels: large pentagonal sites; diamond 

sites; and tiny triangular sites (Figure 1-2). The rare earth cations, i.e. Nd
3+

, occupy the 

rhombic channels (diamond sites), Ba
2+

 cations fill the pentagonal channels [23]. The 

triangular channels are empty. The crystallography of BRT solid-solutions has been 

reported by different authors. Gens et al.[24] suggested Pba2 (No. 32) or Pbam (No. 55) as 

possible space groups for the solid solution with the  lattice parameters calculated for the 

Nd-analogue are a = 12.30 Å, b = 22.21 Å, c = 3.84 Å. Later, Ubic et al. [25] found that 

more correct assignment of space group is Pb21m. 

 

 

Figure 1-2: Tungsten-bronze type like crystal structure of the Ba6-3xR8+2xTi18O54 solid solutions, in 

which R-rare earth [23]. 

  

Without any further ambiguity about the structure of the compound, the solubility 

limit and the formula for BRT (R=Nd and Sr) was studied by Ohsato et al.[26] on the tie 

line x= 0 to 1, depicted in Figure 1-3. Along the tie line, between BaTiO3 and 

BaO.R2O3.4TiO2 compound the ratio between Ti:O(1:3) remain fixed. Such solid solutions 

have different valence cations with large size: divalent Ba
2+

 and smaller trivalent rare earth 



10 

 

R
3+

. To maintain electrostatic stability, three Ba
2+

 ions should be replaced with two R
3+

 

ions and a vacancy. So the substitution formula along the tie line is as follows.  

3Ba
2+

 «==» 2R
3+

 + VAl 

 

where VAl is the valence of A1 site. The derived chemical formula for the solid solution is 

Ba6-3x.R8+2xTi18O54. The authors reported the formation of solid solution of the tertiary 

compound Ba6-3x.R8+2xTi18O54 (R = Nd) for x ranges from 0.0? x ?0.75. 

 

 

Figure 1-3: Ternary phase diagram of BaO-R2O3-TiO2 system [26]. 

 

In later studies, Ohsato et al. [23] found that the tertiary component for x = 2/3 

exhibit a high Qf factor of 10,000 and ?r 80-85 because of higher ordering of Ba and Nd in 

A2 and A1 sites at this composition; another possible reason might be the lower internal 

strain compared with other compositions, which was obtained for the ? = 2?tan? equation 

using Full Widths at Half Maximum (FWHM) of powder XRD, as illustrated in Figure 1-4.  

 

The further solubility limit 0.7? x ?1 was studied by L Zang et al. [27] in which the 

authors reported good dielectric properties for composition x= 0.8, 0.9 and 1 with some 

secondary phases of TiO2 and Nd4Ti9O24.

BNT (1:1:4) have high Qf and permittivity but the tf (+59ppm/ºC) does not match 

the application requirements. To make this material more useful in terms of practical 

applications it has been reported that tf can be tuned by the following approaches (i) by the 

use of additives; (ii) proper variation of the Nd : Ba ratio, and (iii) or combination of 

different rare earth elements. For example, Yong Jun [28] substituted Ba with some 

fraction of Bi to get tf near zero but simultaneously observed that large amounts of Bi 

reduce markedly Qf. By substituting Ba by Pb in BNT(114), Wakino et al. [29] achieved a 

high ?r of 85-88, a tf near zero and Qf = 6000GHz. Later, Nishigaki [30] achieved better 

microwave properties by substituting some Ba by Sr. Yong et al. [31] substituted Bi for Nd 

in Ba6-3x.R8+2xTi18O54 and achieved excellent dielectric properties of ?r  = 99.1, tf = -

5.5ppm/ºC and Qf = 5890GHz. The substitution of Nd and Ti in BaNd2Ti4O12 by Bi and Zr 

originated an increase of the permittivity from 80 to 125 but quality factor decreasees from 

3000 to 600 and 4GHz, as reported by Nenasheva et al [32]. Kim et al [21] studied the 

effect of additional quantities of Nd and Ti on BNT ceramics. With the increase of Nd the 

sintering temperature increases and the quality factor decrease and vice versa for titanium 

excess. The authors concluded that, the deviation from BaO/Nd2O3 = 1, the properties 

decrease because of the formation of secondary phases. 

 

In addition, as a result of the anisometric crystal structure (lattice parameter 

b(22.15)&gt;a(12.13)&gt;c(3.819)), BRT series tend to show anisotropic development of 

elongated grains in the microstructure at particular processing conditions. Therefore the 



12 

 

dielectric properties of BRT ceramics display significant anisotropy as reported by Negas 

[33], and Hoffmann and Waser [34]. 

 

In particular for BNT (1:1:4, x=2/3, discussed above), Wade et al. [35] confirm the 

anisotropic behaviour for ceramics prepared with and without template, and found that in 

perpendicular direction to the (0 0 1)-textured Ba4Nd9.33Ti18O54 (BNdT) tf  decreased from 

59.2 ppm/ºC to 35 ppm/ºC and with template it goes to zero. 

 

An anisotropic behaviour was also reported very recently for thick film of 

BNT(1:1:5) prepared by electrophoretic deposition [36]. It was reported that with 

increasing sintering temperature there is an increase in the aspect ratio of the ceramic 

grains and TC?r changes from -114 to +12ppm/ºC. These results are of particular 

importance since it demonstrates that by controlling the processing parameters one may 

tailor the TC?r of thick films and at the same time to miniaturise the device size. 

Summary of important findings in the BNT system is given in Table 1-3.

The large majority of microwave dielectric ceramics have the perovskite type 

structure or a related one. Perovskites have the general formula ABO3. The classic 

prototype (high-temperature) symmetry is a primitive cubic cell, but perovskites may

undergo many types of phase transitions on cooling and the symmetry is rarely cubic at 

room temperature so as tertiary compound of BaO–La2O3–TiO2 system. 

 

In the BaO–La2O3–TiO2 system, Saltykova et al. [37] found the BanLa4Ti3+nO12+3n 

homologous series exists with three kinds of compounds on the La4Ti3O12–BaTiO3 tie line 

near the tungstenbronze-type like Ba6?3xR8+2x Ti18O54 (R = rare earth) represented in the 

phase diagram of the BaTiO3–La4Ti3O12 binary system of (Figure 1-5): n = 1, 

BaLa4Ti4O15; n = 2, Ba2La4Ti5O18; and n = 4, Ba4La4Ti7O24. Different R&amp;amp;D groups have 

written the compound formula in different ways the Fritz group in France represent it as 

(Ba,La)nTin–1O3n, where n = 5, BaLa4Ti4O15 [38-39-41].

The crystallographic system of BaLa4Ti4O15 compound is an hexagonal perovskite 

like layer structure as proposed by Saltykova et al. [37]. Harre et al. [38] further analyzed 

the crystal structure of BaLa4Ti4O15 without distinguish Ba/la sites by using X-Ray 

diffraction. This structure stacking with (Ba, La)O3 close-packed layer consists of one 

perovskite slab with cubic closed packing and another junction slab with an hexagonal 

closed packing type.

Later, the crystal structure as a function of the Ba/La ordering was analyzed using 

Rietveld refinement of neutron powder diffraction by Teneze et al. [39] and distinguishes 

the Ba and La sites in the crystal structure of BaLa4Ti4O15 compound. Ohsato et al. [40] 

have also successfully distinguished the sites of Ba
2+

 and La
3+

 in BaLa4Ti4O15 compound 

by the X-ray analysis of single crystal regardless of similarity for atomic scattering factors. 

G. Trolliard et al. [41] study the microphases in the La4Ti3O12-BaTiO3 system by using 

HRTEM to investigate the coherent intergrowth occurrence in this system. 

 

It has been reported that the structure of BLT corresponds to a close packing of 

AO3 (where A = Ba, La) mixed layers [41]. Within the layers, the A and O atoms are 

ordered ( Figure 1-6(a)). Each A atom is surrounded by six oxygen atoms, whereas each 

oxygen atom has two linearly coordinated A atoms among its six nearest neighbours. To 

avoid any direct A–A connection, successive layers are shifted from each other by a 1/3(0 

1 -1 0)H vector, so that the A atom positions in one layer project into the centre of a 

triangle formed by the A atoms in the adjacent layers (position 1 or 2 in Figure 1-6(a)). 

One quarter of the octahedral interstices between two such layers are surrounded 

exclusively by oxygen atoms and are occupied by Ti atoms (the small open circles in 

Figures 1-6 (b)–(d)). All oxygen octahedra located within the cubic-close-packed (ccp) part 

of the sequence are corner shared and occupied by Ti atoms. In each triplet of face-sharing 

octahedra, characteristic of the hexagonal-close-packed (hcp) part of the sequence, the 

central octahedra are vacant. The lattice parameter a is determined by the hexagonal 

sublattice of A atoms and remains nearly constant at ~5.6 A°. The c parameter depends on 

the stacking sequence of AO3 layers (the thickness of each octahedral sheet is ~2.2 A°). In 

the case of BLT, n = 5, and a cooperative tilting of TiO6 octahedra within the perovskite 

blocks leads to doubling of the c-axis. As a consequence, BLT is ascribed as a trigonal 

structure with the space group P.3c1, and the lattice parameters derived from x-ray 

diffraction data are a = 5.5720 A° and c = 22.500 A° (?10 × 2.2 A° ), respectively, in the 

hexagonal setting [14]. 

 

Reaney et al. [42] further investigated the structure of BLT ceramics because of the 

existing asymmetric peak in X-Ray diffraction studies. Based on energy-dispersive x-ray 

analysis and raman spectroscopy it was concluded that there is a heterogeneous distribution 



15 

 

of the constituent cations, may induce asymmetry which cause the presence of two 

hexagonal phases of slightly different lattice parameter.  

 

The dielectric properties of BaLa4Ti4O15 ceramics were reported by Vineis et 

al.[43] to be ?r = 43, Qf = 11583GHz and tf = -17ppm/ºC. La was substituted with various 

cations as Al, Y, Sm, Nd and Gd for composition n=1 in order to obtain tf near zero and 

best results were achieved for Al with tf = +1.3 ppm/ºC, ?r  = 44 and Qf = 47000GHz.  

 

The dielectric properties of BanLa4Ti3+nO12+3n were investigated by Ohsato et al. 

[44] as well and it was found that properties for `n´ ranges from 0.8-2, ?r stays constant 

around 45 and Qf varies between 30000GHz to 48000GHz and tf from -21 to -12ppm/ºC. 

For n = 2 to 4, ?r, tf increases and Qf decreases because of the formation of secondary 

phases Ba5La4Ti8O27. It was then concluded that compounds ranging from n = 1 to 2 are 

the suitable materials for microwave applications in base stations of portable telephones 

with ?r = 44, Qf = 47000GHz and tf = +1.3 ppm/ºC.  

 

On further investigation on dielectric properties and phase formation for ceramics 

of BaxLa4Ti3+xO12+3x where `x´ ranges from 0-1 Yamada et al. [45] found that for 

homologous compound BanLa4Ti3+nO12+3n ,  n = 0, the single phase exists for 

BaxLa4Ti3+xO12+3x , x = 0.0-0.5 and for n = 1 and in the intermediate region the two phase 

co-exist.

packed and hexagonal close-packed, respectively[14]. 

 

Jawahar el at. [46] investigated the properties of MO–La2O3–TiO2 where M is Ba, 

Sr and Ca. For BaLa4Ti4O15 ceramics with relative density of 96.2% they found that  ?r = 

49, Qf = 16222 GHz and tf -13ppm/ºC, which are similar to the results to those reported by 

Ohsato et al. [2].   

 

For improving the properties of BLT, Longtu Li et al. [47] substitute small amounts 

of Ba by Ca and Sr in (Ba1?xAx)La4Ti4O15 (where A is Ca and Sr). It was reported that with 

Ca substitutions, the permittivity of the sample increases and tf approaches from -3 to -

10ppm/ºC, ?r = 46, Qf 52800. In the case of Sr substitution the temperature of sintering is 

reduced to some extent and achieve high Qf  up to 53,000 GHz, ?r = 49 and tf  -3ppm/ºC.

Similar to BNT in BLT ceramics, the large anisotropy in the lattice parameters (a = 

5.5720 A° versus c = 22.500 A°) promotes the growth of lath or plate-like particles. Such 

grains have been reported to align during powder pressing with the a, b plane normal to the 

pressing direction, and the final sintered body is therefore grain-oriented [42]. Anisotropy 

in the dielectric permittivity was absorbed by 20% in these ceramics, when measured in the 

parallel and perpendicular direction to the pressing one. 

 

All the work mentioned above prepared the tertiary compound (BaLa4Ti4O15) by 

the solid-state method. Y. Fukami et al. [48] in his studies use the molten salt synthesis 

method using NaCl, KCl and NaCl–KCl flux. Similarly the authors mixed the BLT 

templets (plate-like) during the synthesis and observed the anisotropic microstructure in 

the sintered ceramics. The samples prepared with templates shows higher properties then 

sample prepared without templates. 

 

Hong Zheng et al. [49] used glass as a sintering aid material for the composites of 

BLT and BNT. The sintering temperature was reduced from 1400-1500ºC to 950-1140ºC 

respectively. The addition of glass did not introduce considerable changes in ?r and tf but 

the Qf (~2305GHz) was deteriorated. Table 1-4 represents the important properties 

reported for BaO2-La2O3-TiO2 (1:2:4) compound.

1.5 Application of Microwave Ceramics 

Microwave ceramics are used as a dielectric resonator. The term dielectric 

resonator is defined as a, cylinder with relative permittivity ?r sufficiently high for a 

standing electromagnetic wave to be sustained within its volume because of reflection at 

the dielectric–air interface.  Dielectric resonators generally consist of a "puck" of ceramic 

that has a large dielectric constant and a low dissipation factor. The resonance frequency is 

determined by the overall physical dimensions of the puck and the dielectric constant of 

the material.  

 

There are many field modes possible within a resonant chamber. These modes are 

divided into four basic types, depending on their field components. A propagating 

electromagnetic wave can have both longitudinal and transverse components. If both the 

electrical and magnetic fields have only transverse components then the mode is called a 

transverse electric and magnetic mode or TEM mode. If the electric field´s longitudinal 

component is zero but the magnetic field is allowed a non zero longitudinal component, 

then the mode is called a transverse magnetic mode or TM mode. Conversely, if the 

magnetic field´s longitudinal component is zero but the electric field is allowed a non zero 

longitudinal component, then the mode is called transverse electric, or TE mode. If the 

both electric and magnetic field are allowed non zero longitudinal field components, then 

the mode is a hybrid field different modes. 

  

 TE and TM modes are generally written with subscripts, TEnmp, to donate the 

geometry. The first script, n denotes the number of azimuthal or circumferential field 

variations in the resonator. The second subscript, m, denotes the number of radial field 

variations in the width of the resonator. The last subscript p denotes the number of axial 

variations of the field along the resonator’s height. It can be express as the sum p = l + ?, 

where ? is a non integer number smaller than unity and depends in a complicated way on 

propagation constant and geometry; and l = 0,1,2,….A diagram of all modes are 

represented in Figure 1-7. 

 

TE01? mode resonator is suitable for the resonator with high Q such as channel 

filters for the base station. This mode resonator has the highest Q values in the resonator

type but the size is very large. However, TM010 modes have 65 % less Qf then TE01? mode 

resonator but size is only about 15 % of TE01? mode resonator. TEM is the most common 

coaxial type resonator; it is widely used as filters in mobile phone and many other radio 

communication equipment. 

 

Dielectric resonators are increasingly being used at lower frequency, down to 1GHz 

in mobile telecommunications application frequently as filters. Dielectric resonators at this 

frequency are bulky but still smaller then cavity resonators. The dielectric ceramics with 

permittivity higher then 38 is acceptable for this application with high Qf. For further 

reducing the size, the researches are looking for materials which have high dielectric 

permittivity with high Q factor [50]. Figure 1-8 shows an example of a space qualified 

commercial dielectric resonator filter that has been designed for direct broad cast TV 

satellites operate at 12GHz.

The integration of antenna technology and active devices to form transceiver 

modules and electronically scanned array has usually been accomplished in numerous 

configurations using microstrip patch antennas. However, open dielectric resonators offer 

attractive features as integrated antenna elements, which still need to explore. The 

advantage includes their small size, mechanical simplicity, high radiation efficiency, 

relative large width etc. [7]. The most successful fabricated components have been in the 

area of antennas, either surface-wave antennas or leaky-wave antennas. [52] Several types 

of miniature antennas are now in use. 

 

As said above, application of dielectric materials in microwave components is very 

cost effective and lead to a significant miniaturization of the device, particularly when 

microwave integrated circuit (MIC) or monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) 

structures are used. Excellent performance in filters and oscillators are currently being 

achieved. Additional applications include radar, satellite, portable telephone, satellite 

broadcasting, ultra-high speed wireless local area network (LAN), intelligent transport 

system (ITS) comprising ladder for anti-collision, security systems detectors and so on 

[53]. Miniature dielectric-filled coaxial resonators are commonly used in wireless headsets 

(cellular and personal communication system (PCS) phones). Recently available very high-

Q materials will extend commercial applications of DRs to much higher frequencies. 

Applications of as high as 100 GHz are being reported [52]. 



21 

 

In spite of all of these recent development further progresses required for dielectric 

to be used at high frequency and MW in order to full fill the recent requirements demanded 

by the telecommunication industry, namely 

1) Decrease the size, what implies the replacement of bulky dielectrics by thick 

and thin films dielectrics; 

2) Decrease the dielectric losses, what implies the look at alternative engineering 

solutions, besides the control of the intrinsic properties of the material 

3) Decrease of the fabrication costs, what implies the research for low cost based 

technologies and low sintering temperature materials.

Electrophoretic Deposition Technique 

 

Abstract: 

With the evolution of microelectronics, the size of the devices is getting smaller and 

smaller with hybrid functionality. To make such devices, thick film technology is 

becoming more and more important in particular for electronic devices, namely for surface 

mounted devices, hybrid integrated circuits and sensors. A number of established 

techniques for thick films fabrication have been reported, such as screen printing, ink-

jetting, tap casting and Electrophoretic deposition (EPD). Among all the above techniques, 

electrophoretic technique has gain considerable importance because of its high reliability, 

low cost and high performance products. In this chapter, a review on EPD technique is 

presented, which includes EPD mechanisms and kinetics, fabrication parameters (such as 

deposition and suspension variables), and applications. 

 

2.1 Introduction 

History of EPD 

 

EPD is known since 1808, when a russian scientist Ruess saw that clay particles 

move in the presence of the electric field. The first practical use of EPD was reported in 

1933 in a USA patent for the deposition of thoria particles on platinum substrates [1] The 

use of EPD for the fabrication of ceramics was first investigated by Hamaker [2] in 1940 

and more recently in 1980´s it received a great deal of attention for the fabrication of 

advanced ceramics. 

 

More recently, the number of applications has quickly developed, and as noted by 

Boccaccini [3], there has been a considerable increase in the areas of application of EPD in 

the last 10 years, denoted by the existence of more than a thousand articles and patents 

related to EPD. Figure 2-1 shows the extraordinary increase of the number of published 

scientific papers, identified in a Web of Science search. The keywords ?electrophoretic 

deposition?, from only less than 100 papers before 1970s to more than 1800 papers 

published since 2000.

Definitions of EPD  

 

Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) is a colloidal process, which is used for coatings 

and fabrication of films. It has gain considerable interest not only in academia but also in 

industries because of the versatility of its use with different materials and substrates and 

cost effectiveness. The other advantages of EPD include the possibility to be used to 

deposit coatings on complex shaped materials and despite being a wet process it offer easy 

control of over thickness and morphology of the deposited film by controlling the 

processing parameters like voltage and time.  

 

The term ?electro deposition? is somewhat ambiguous because it can refer to either 

electroplating or electrophoretic deposition, although it more often refers to the former. In 

the electroplating processes, a coating is produced by the diffusion and migration of 

individual ions in the solvent to the deposition electrode where they are electrochemically 

converted to an insoluble form, in which the reaction is the reduction of metal ions in 

solution to form the metal. In contrast, EPD uses charged particles that move under an 

external electric field to form consolidated films onto the opposite electrode (Table 2-1). 



27 

 

[4]. There are two types of EPD depending on which electrode the deposition happens. 

When the particles are positively charged, the deposition is formed on the cathode and the 

process is called cathodic EPD. On the contrary, the deposition formation on positive 

electrode (anode) is termed as anodic EPD (Figure 2-2). By suitable modification of the 

surface charge on the particles, both of the two modes of deposition are possible. [4]

2.2 Charge Mechanisms on Particles 

In terms of principle, during EPD the particles in the suspension move towards the 

electrode if they have enough charge on the surface. Four mechanisms have been identified 

by Omer van der Biest et at. [5] by which the powder particles get charged:  

1) A selective adsorption of ions from the liquid onto the solid particle; 

2) Dissociation of ions from the solid phase into the liquid; 



28 

 

3) Adsorption or orientation of dipolar molecules at the particles surface; 

4) Electron transfer between the solid and liquid phase due to different work function. 

In the case of ceramic particles, the last mechanism is not applicable but the first 

two invariably occur. The sign of the net charge on the particle will depend not only on 

whether the ions involved are positive or negative, but also on whether mechanism (a) or 

(b) is dominant. Also, a positively-charged particle may even behave like a negative one, 

which is attracted to a positive electrode, if an excess of negative ions are attracted to the 

vicinity of the particles. Consequently, it is difficult to predict whether a deposition will 

occur on positive or negative electrodes in an unknown system.  

 

2.3 Electrical Double Layer Concept and Zeta Potential 

The electric double layer concept is a very important one for the surface chemistry 

of materials in colloidal science field, i.e. in EPD. It describes the variation of the electric 

potential near a surface, and has a large bearing on the behaviour of colloids. Development 

of a net charge at the particle surface affects the distribution of ions in the surrounding 

interfacial region, resulting in an increased concentration of counter ions (ions with oppose 

charge to that of the particle) close to the surface. The liquid layer surrounding the particle 

consists of two parts: an inner region where the ions are strongly bounded and an outer 

(diffuse) region where they are less firmly associated. Within this diffuse layer is a 

boundary known as the slipping plane, within which the particle acts as a single entity. [7] 

 

An assumed negative charge particle in a suspension is surrounded by ions with a 

positive charge in a concentration higher than the bulk concentration of these ions; this is 

the so-called electrical Double-Layer as illustrated in Figure 2-3 (a).The double layer 

thickness is of great importance in colloid stability and, for that matter, on flocculation, 

since it controls the range of the double layer interaction. The thickness is determined by 

the concentration and valence of the ions in suspension. A high concentration of ions (high 

ionic strength) in the medium generally results in a decrease in the double layer thickness 

and consequent decrease in the potential. [8] When an electric field is applied, the charged 

particles and surrounding ions will move in opposite directions. However, the ions are also 

attracted by the particle, and as a result, a fraction of the ions surrounding the particles will 



29 

 

not move in the opposite direction but will move along with the particles. Hence, there is a 

surface of shear between the particles and the surrounding ions. As shown in Figure 2-3 (a) 

the potential at the surface of slipping plane is termed the zeta-potential or electrokinetic 

potential [9]. 

 

The schematic curve of zeta potential versus pH value is depicted in Figure 2-3 (b). 

The zeta potential is affected by the pH environment and is usually positive for low pH 

values and negative at high pH. 

 

Numerous physical and chemical factors can influence the magnitude and sign of 

the zeta potential. It may depend on the presence or absence of added electrolytes, or on 

the concentration of the suspension itself. In addition, zeta potential can be controlled by a 

variety of charging agents such as acids, bases and specifically adsorbed ions or 

polyelectrolytes, in the suspension [10]. Thus it is possible to use a variety of additives that 

affects the charge magnitude and its polarity in the suspension on EPD. Generally, the 

main criteria for selection of a charging agent are the preferred polarity and deposition rate 

of the particles.

value.

30 

 

The zeta potential is the main parameter determining the electrokinetic behavior of 

particles in suspension, and as a consequence is a key factor in the EPD process. It is 

imperative to achieve a high zeta potential and a uniform surface charge density on the 

surface of suspended particles for a successful EPD. Zeta potential plays a role in: (i) the 

stabilization of the suspension by determining the intensity of repulsive interactions 

between the particles, (ii) determining the direction and migration velocity of particles 

during EPD and (iii) determining the quality of the deposit. As zeta potential is closely 

related to the particle’s double layer thickness, it provides also information on the 

agglomeration of the particles in the suspension. In general, the higher the absolute value 

of the measured zeta potential, the better is the dispersion of the particles in the suspension 

[9]. 

 

2.4 Mechanisms of Deposition  

Although EPD is an old process still the exact mechanism of deposition is not 

entirely clear. However some theories discussed possible mechanisms. 

 

Hamaker et al. [12] have suggested that EPD is a sedimentation process due to 

gravitation. The pressure by incoming particles enables the particles next to the deposition 

electrode to overcome the inter particle repulsion and sit on the electrode. Koelmans has 

calculated the ionic strength near the electrode and found that it is equal to the ionic 

strength required for the flocculation of a suspension [13]. Grillon has suggested that 

particle neutralizes upon contact with the deposition electrode or the deposit [14]. Sarkar 

and Nicholson [1] suggested the double layer of counter ions also move with the particle 

but the double layer is thinner ahead of the moving particle and thicker behind (illustrated 

in Figure 2-4), therefore the concentration of ions near the electrode is higher as compared 

to the solution. Thus, the counter ions recombine with their incoming co-ions to reform the 

original salt, which result in the thinning of the double layer of the particle in the deposit. 

As a result there is a decrease in the repulsion near the substrate because of the thin double 

layer what allows the particles to over come this repulsion barrier and attached to each by 

weak force such as van der Waal forces, allowing a deposit to be formed.

2.5 Kinetics of Electrophoretic Deposition 

To make EPD process commercially more viable the knowledge of the kinetics of 

EPD process is necessary. 

 

Hamaker [2] proposed that the amount of deposited film is proportional to the 

concentration of the suspension, time of deposition, surface area of deposit, and the electric 

field. This yield of deposition varies linearly with applied field according to Hamaker’s 

equation  

                                          M=?

??                                                         (2.1) 

where M stands for the mass deposited in time t (s), C for the particle concentration in the 

suspension (kg/m
3
), E for the electric field (V/m), A for the electrode area (m

2
), µ for the 

electrophoretic mobility (m
2
/V?s)), a stands for and ? stands for a coefficient representing 

the fraction of particles deposited near the electrode. 

  

In principle, EPD can be conducted under constant current or constant voltage with 

either constant or variable concentration against deposition time. Sarkar et al. [15] studied 

the kinetic aspects of EPD through schematic plots of deposit weight versus deposition 

time for four possible deposition conditions (Figure 2-5): curve A (constant current and 

constant suspension solid concentration), curve B (constant current but decreasing 



32 

 

suspension solid concentration), curve C (constant voltage and constant suspension solid 

concentration) and curve D (constant voltage but decreasing suspension solid 

concentration). The curve A shows that the rate of deposition is constant with time, 

differently, the rate of deposition decreases asymptotically against deposition time in either 

of the B, C, or D curves. Apparently, the deposition efficiency is highest in curve A, 

followed by curves B, C, and D, respectively in a certain deposition time. By comparison 

of the curves A, B, C and D, it clearly reveals that the highest efficiency is realized by 

constant current and constant suspension solid concentration in terms of the deposition 

weight or thickness. In addition, it is much easier to predict and to control accurately the 

deposited yield or thickness in constant current and constant suspension solid 

concentration. 

 

 

Figure 2-5: Deposited weight as a function of the deposition time [1]. 

 

2.6 Parameters Related with Suspension 

The main suspension parameter is the medium. 

In EPD, water based and organic based mediums are used for deposition. Generally 

the non aqueous medium is preferred over aqueous medium due to the reasons discussed 

ahead. In water based medium electrolysis takes place at lower voltages (~5V), which 

results in the formation of gas bubbles at the electrodes and formation of poor coatings or 

films. The density of the electric current is also higher in water suspensions which results 

in the heating of the suspension and sometimes loss of stability. The above stated reasons 

limit the use of aqueous medium at high voltages. 



33 

 

 

However, high voltages may be desirable in order to achieve high coating 

thicknesses or to increase the rate of deposition. In such applications, organic solvents are 

used as a medium. The organic solvents used are generally polar solvents such as alcohols 

and ketones. Ethanol, acetone, and methyl ethyl ketone are examples of solvents which 

have been reported as suitable candidates for electrophoretic deposition and their 

properties are summarised in Table 2-2.

The other parameters besides the suspension medium that affect the quality of the 

suspension are: 

1) Particle size and particle size distribution  

2) Dielectric constant of the suspension 

3) Conductivity of the suspension 

4) Viscosity of the suspension  

5) Zeta Potential 

6) Stability of the suspension 

 

Concerning the particle size and particle size distribution, it is advisable to have a 

particle size within the range of 1-20 micrometer [16]. The use of particles with bigger 

sizes results in sedimentation because of gravitational force originating poor film quality. 

In addition, a lower particle size and particle size distribution allows to avoid the formation 

of cracks in the films as Sato N et al. [17] observed in YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO).  



34 

 

The behaviour of the dielectric constant of the suspension media was studied by 

Powers et al. [18] in different suspensions with beta-alumina particle. The authors found 

that the deposition only take place for the solvent with dielectric constant in range of 12-

25. For lower dielectric constant, the deposition fails because of the insufficient 

dissociative power of solvent and in the case of higher dielectric constant the high ionic 

concentration in the suspension reduces the thickness of the double layer and  consequently 

the electrophoretic mobility.  

 

In terms of conductivity of the suspension, based on the systematic studies of 

Ferrari and Moreno [19] on the effect of conductivity and the viscosity of the suspension, it 

was observed that if the conductivity of the suspension is very low, the particle charge 

electronically and suspension looses the stability; on the other hand if the conductivity is 

high the particle motion is very slow. However, applied current can increase the margin of 

the suitable conductivity region for EPD. It is generally accepted that the suitable regions 

of conductive are different for different systems. 

 

As to the zeta potential it indicates the degree of repulsion between adjacent, 

similarly charged particles in dispersion. As mentioned previously, a high zeta potential 

will confer stability to the suspension i.e. the solution or dispersion will resist to 

agglomeration. So, colloids with high zeta potential (negative or positive) are electrically 

stable while colloids with low zeta potentials tend to coagulate or flocculate. Table 2-3 

represent the stability behaviour of the colloids with zeta potential.   

 

Zeta potential plays a major role in the: 1) stability of the suspension, 2) 

determination of the direction of the particle migration and 3) green density of the compact 

film [5]. A high particle charge is indeed required for a good stability of the suspension 

that will ensure also a high and homogeneous green density of the deposited film. If the 

particle charge is low, the particle tend to coagulate, the interspaces between the particles 

are high and lead to a poor green density of the compact. Higher surface charge particle 

during deposition keeps the particles apart from each other, avoids coagulation and leads to 

a high particle density. Therefore, it is essential to control the amount of suspension and 

additives. 



35 

 

The stability of the suspension is characterized by the settling rate and the tendency 

to undergo or to avoid flocculation. Stable suspensions show no tendency to flocculation, 

settle slowly and form dense and strongly adhering deposits at the bottom of the container. 

The stability is mostly referred by the value of the zeta potential of the system high the zeta 

potential value better is the stability of the suspension [5]. The stability of the suspension 

can be explain by the DLVO theory.  

 

Table 2-3: The stability behaviour of colloids corresponds to zeta potential values [24].

more than ±61 Excellent stability 

 

DLVO theory established by Derjaguin and Landau [20] and Verwey and Overbeek 

[21]. According to this theory, the stability of a colloidal system is determined by the total 

energy of interaction, determined by the sum of the electrical double layer repulsive forces 

(VR) and the van der Waals attractive forces (VA) which the particles experience as they 

approach each other. Increasing the ionic strength can significantly reduce the repulsive 

forces. The behaviour of particle separations depends critically upon the ionic strength and 

hence the electrolyte concentration of the suspension. At very low ionic strengths, the 

potential energy is high, make strong repulsive forces producing a totally dispersed system. 

At a slightly higher but still low enough ionic strengths, the role of electrolytes, such as, 

coagulants or flocculants, is either to reduce the electrostatic repulsion and hence making it 

easier for the particles aggregation, thereby destabilizing the suspension. But, re-dispersion 

is also possible by diluting the electrolyte solution to decrease the ionic strength. Finally, in 

a high ionic strength, the colloid particles experience no repulsive forces. Consequently, 

fast coagulation occurs and the system is completely unstable under such circumstances. 

 



36 

 

The original DLVO theory only considered the van der Waals and electrostatic 

interactions in the suspension. Recently, it was proposed that the stabilization of colloidal 

dispersions might also be affected by steric stabilization and structural forces. [22] These 

mechanisms become important when long chain macromolecules are adsorbed to the 

particles surface. When these particles with polymer chains protruding from their surfaces 

come close to each other, sharp repulsive steric interactions will happen. In this case the 

chain configuration of the polymer is a very important parameter in steric stabilization [23] 

and determines the quality of the dispersant. Caution must be paid in using sterically 

stabilized suspension for EPD. For example, in extreme cases, adsorbed polymers can 

reverse the sign of surface charge, so the deposition may fail or could occur on the counter 

electrode.  

 

2.7 Parameters Related with Deposition Process 

2.7.1 Effect of Deposition Time 

Basu et al. [25] have observed that for constant applied voltage during initial time 

of deposition the thickness stay linear with time and deviates from the linearity for longer 

time of deposition. A similar finding was observed by Chen and Liu [26] for ZnO coatings 

on copper substrate as shown in Figure 2-6. In constant voltage deposition the electric field 

decrease with the deposition time because of the formation of an insulating layer of 

ceramic particle on the electrode [26].  

 

Figure 2-6: Thickness versus time at constant voltage for ZnO suspensions [26]. 



37 

 

2.7.2 Effect of Applied Voltage 

The deposition thickness increases linearly with the constant time and varying 

applied potential. Powders can be deposited more quickly under high applied fields, but the 

quality (morphology and density) of the deposit can be affected by applied high fields. 

Indeed Basu at al [25] found that the more uniform films are formed at moderate electric 

fields between 25-100 V/cm and the films deposited under higher fields have poor surface 

texture. Recently in the work of Fu Zhi et al.[27] on BNT thick films by EPD it was found 

that for high voltages the deposition thickness decrease drastically (shown in Figure 2-7) 

and the quality of the deposited films is non uniform. A high applied field may cause 

turbulence in the suspension and the coating may be disturbed by flows in the surrounding 

medium during its deposition. At the same time under high applied fields, particles move 

very fast so that they may not have enough time to sit in their best positions to form a 

close-packed structure. 

 

 

Figure 2-7: Deposition thickness versus applied voltage for constant time [27]. 

 

2.7.3 Conductivity of the Substrate 

Conductivity of the substrate is an important parameter and it affects the quality of 

the green films deposited by EPD. Substrate of low conductivity such as La0.9Sr0.1MnO3 

(LSM) leads to a decrease of the deposition rate and non-uniform green films. [28]. 



38 

 

2.8 Applications of EPD Technique 

The EPD technique can be applied for any class of materials which are available in 

the form of fine powders, this includes ceramic, metal, polymer, and glasses. This process 

already gain success in various applications and can be used to produce coatings, for shape 

monolithic, laminated and graded free-standing objects, and for infiltration of porous 

materials and woven fibre preforms for composite production. 

 

Coatings – EPD is already in used for coatings, being the automotive industry one 

of the examples. German car maker companies are coating 800 bodies per hour by EPD 

[29]. Other examples are the deposition of insulating glass for electronic applications [30] 

and superconductive coating [31-32]. Worthwhile to note is the possibility of coating 

almost any complex shaped object, such as metal cone with ceramic glaze [33] or Carbon 

Cathode Tube coated with phosphor [34]. 

 

Monoliths -  For traditional ceramics, such as sanitary ware, the main advantage of 

EPD lies in its higher speed and in the low wear of the moulds compared with tape casting. 

Tiles, closed and open end tubes, hemispheres, tubes with changes in diameter, and conical 

sections are some of the shapes that have been made by EPD. Technical ceramics such as 

alumina [35-36], silicon carbide [31-35], and aluminium nitride [37-38] have been shaped 

by EPD and are commercially available in the market for a long time. A good example of 

the classical use of EPD is the fabrication of Beta-alumina tubes, used as electrolyte in 

sodium sulphur batteries [39-40]. 

 

Laminated materials - Laminated structures can be fabricate by EPD by 

depositing one layer over the other by moving from one suspension to another. Nicholson 

et al. [41] have produced ZrO2/Al2O3 laminates with alumina layer as thick as 12µm and 

zirconia layer of 2µm from ethanol based suspension. Vandeperre and Van der Beist [42] 

deposited layers of SIC-based interlayers. You et al. [43] reported the fabrication of 

SiC/TiC laminated structures as illustrated in Figure 2.8. 

 

 



39 

 

 

Figure 2-8:  SiC/TiC laminated structure produced by constant-current EPD [43]. 

 

Fibre reinforced ceramic matrix composites - EPD is a simplest and cost 

effective method for fabrication of high-quality fibre reinforced ceramic matrix 

composites. Kaya et al. [44] used EPD to infiltrate performs with tight fibre weave 

architectures using different anodized ceramic particles, including silica and boehemite 

sols, as well as dual-component sols of mullite compositions. Figure 2-9 depicts the EPD 

infiltrated Ni-coated carbon fibres reinforced alumina matrix composites containing 30 

vol% of fibre loading.  

 

 

Figure 2-9: Ni-coated carbon fibre perform infiltrated with boehmite sol. [44] 

 



40 

 

Deposition of nano particles into nanostructures – The rising interest in the field 

of nanostructure is because often these structures exhibit new properties that are 

remarkably different from the bulk ones and because by controlling the size one can 

manipulate the properties. EPD of nanoparticles was first investigated by Giersig and 

Mulvaney [45, 46] to prepare ordered monolayers of gold nanoparticles. Tebellion and 

Clased [47] investigated the structured deposition of gold, silver and rare earth carbonate 

nanoparticles. 

 

In the last few years the interest of the scientific community in carbon nanotubes 

(CNTs) has increased significantly as reflected by the huge number of papers published 

and patents [48-49]. To further expand the horizon for the application of CNTs researchers 

are using EPD for making thin films of CNTs. Jung et al. [50-51] deposited the thin film of 

Single wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) in aqueous media and the deposited film showed 

good field emission properties. Hasabe et al. [52] deposited the SWCNT on SnO2 electrode 

for solar cell application. Boccaccini et al. [53] have deposited MWCNTs onto highly 

porous bioactive glass scaffolds with the intention of imparting a monotopography to the 

pore wall surfaces (Figure 2-10).  The scientist have also successfully synthesized the 

nanorods, nanowires and nanotubes of ZnO by EPD.[54].

a bioactive glass foam [53]

Chapter 3. Objective of this thesis 

 

 ?On many levels, RF/microwave today compares to digital's (silicon based 

circuitry) level of integration a quarter century or so ago — essentially a lot of large (by 

current standards) components bunched together. Digital, however, has been on a 

seemingly unstoppable evolution toward ever-smaller, less-costly, and more- tightly 

integrated components, driven largely by the demands of consumer electronics such as cell 

phones, pocket-sized GPS devices, digital cameras, and even hearing aides. The same is 

not true for RF/microwave … ? in Military &amp;amp; Aerospace Electronics August, 2004, by J.R. 

Wilson [1].  

 

However as frequencies continue to move stealthily up because the density of 

available spectrum is increasing and as noise and couplings become more problematic for 

digital circuits, there is currently a market drive for the search of solutions intermediate 

between digital and RF/microwave circuits. Within this context, miniaturization (small and 

compact), integration and lowering costs are key words in the RF/microwave arena. 

 

New advanced technology to build low loss, lower phase noise integrated circuits 

with low cost, high density, small size and lightweight are indeed required in this rapidly 

growing wireless industry. [2] One example is miniaturization of systems such as planar 

circuits, antennas, filters, couplers, baluns, etc. Because of this demand of smallness, thin 

and/or thick dielectric films are now being considered to replace dielectric components 

currently utilized in bulk ceramic form. This drives the use of thick film processing 

techniques, such as Electrophoretic Deposition (EPD), for the fabrication of dielectric thick 

films for RF and High Frequencies. 

 

 Although thin film technologies are being explored for the wireless circuit 

technology as well, they are expensive with limited suitability for commercial mass 

production [3]. Alternatively, thick films technology offers advantages such as low cost, 

reproducibility and feasibility to be large-scale continuous process. Thick films allow 

designers to combine microwave and digital functions on proper substrates and to 

incorporate components to the main structures, which offers increased potentials in terms 



45 

 

of reliability, miniaturization of circuits, circuit design capabilities, continuous flow in 

production processes, and hence a reduction in cost [4]. Besides, thick dielectric films have 

the capability of withstanding high voltages and high thermal conductivity, which led to 

applications in mobile phone RF power amplifiers where small physical size and high 

power handling is necessary; in addition, thick dielectric films can also be used as 

substrates in microelectronic devices to support mechanically other materials and to ensure 

their adhesion on it, which may be difficult to achieve with thin film materials [4]. 

 

As describe before, among low loss dielectrics, the BaO-Re2O3-TiO2 (Re = 

La,Nd,Sm,Pr) system represents an important commercial family of microwave materials. 

Although BNT ceramics are currently being produced for resonators, antennas and 

substrates [7], as shown in Figure 3-1(a) and BLT has optimum properties for base station 

application, the high permittivity of BNT and BLT make them suitable candidates for the 

miniaturization in to thick films.  

 

On the other hand the fabrication of dielectric films on metal foils is presently of 

interest for devices integrated into electronic packaging due to cost and space benefits. [13] 

For example, as shown in Figure 3-1 (b), the current microstrip patch antenna usually 

requires the metallization of a ground plane on one side of the dielectric materials by 

screen printing. However, this metallization process can be avoided by directly depositing 

the dielectric layer on a metallic substrate. In this case, for the reasons above described and 

in particular the possibility of being scaled up, EPD looks like very appealing for this 

purpose.

Hence the general objective of this thesis is to contribute, from the materials 

science perspective, to the pool of scientific and engineering knowledge that will allow the 

development of next generation of small, integrated and low cost based RF/microwave 

devices. 

 



47 

 

As said before, for microwave dielectrics, there are three significant properties to 

be considered: (i) the relative permittivity, that determines the size of the electronic 

component; (ii) the loss tangent (or quality factor, Q) that determines the selectivity and 

performance of the device and (iii) the temperature coefficient of the resonant frequency 

that determines the frequency stability of the device [5]. And among the materials 

recognised to full fill these requirements tungsten bronzoids BaO–Ln2O3–TiO2 (Ln = Nd, 

La, among others) with high ?r (80- 90) and low losses (Q = 10,000) and low tf (+ 

59ppm/ºC) represent an important commercial family of microwave materials [6]. 

 

BaO-Nd2O3-TiO2 ceramics are currently being produced for resonators, filters and 

substrates, among others applications [7], but the commercial use of BNT thick films has 

not yet been reported. However, the first results on the fabrication and characterization of 

BNT thick films that have been published very recently [8-9] are quite promising. It is 

demonstrated that 52 µm thick BaNd2Ti5O14 films exhibit a dielectric constant and a loss 

tangent of 107 and 0.0006 (Q of 1600) at 1 MHz, respectively, TC?r is below +58.5 

ppm/°C and the losses are not significantly increased up to the gigahertz regime. 

Particularly relevant is the demonstration that with thick films besides facilitating scaling 

to small device sizes for high frequency operations, the control of substrate constraint and 

sintering conditions can be used to control grain anisotropy and thus microwave properties 

of BNT films, namely tuning TC?r to zero. 

 

Another member of the tungsten bronzoid family is BanLa4Ti3+nO12+3n (BLT). BLT 

has hexagonal perovskite structure with ?r~44, Q.f~47,000 GHz and tf - 2ppm/ºC. Similarly 

to BNT, BLT dielectric characteristics may allow for further miniaturization of filters and 

oscillator components in systems ranging from cellular telephones to global positioning 

technologies [10]. Contrary to BNT, there are no reports on the fabrication and 

characteristics of BLT thick films.  

 

In terms of Microwave Material, materials for resonators according to Ian M. 

Reaney [11] there is currently a lack of dielectric materials with dielectric permittivity 

between 45 and 80, together with low losses and low tf as shown in Figure 3-2. 

 



48 

 

 

Figure 3-2: log10 Q.fo versus ?r for commercial or equivalent dielectric microwave dielectric ceramics 

[11]. 

 

One way of full filling this need is by engineering materials, for example by 

fabricating composite materials in which the properties will be tailored by mixing 

appropriate contents of end members that per se have opposite tf. Composite MW ceramics 

of xBNT-(1-x)BLT system were synthesise and the best properties were obtained for the 

composition x = 0.55 and 0.75 with ?r = 61, tf &amp;lt;-21ppm/ºC and Qf &gt; 10,000GHz [12]. 

Another approach to tailor the dielectric properties of MW materials, namely to achieve 

temperature stability, recently explored in the field of thin films, is the fabrication of 

layered structures. 

 

However no such approaches have yet been considered for dielectric thick films. 

Hence, the specific objective of this thesis is the proof of concept of electrophoretic 

deposition of structured, microwave composites, that includes: i) to develop a method of 

fabricating structured functional composites using electrophoretic deposition, ii) to 

fabricate planar BaLa4Ti4O15 (BLT) and Ba4Nd9.33Ti18O54 (BNT) composites, iii) to 

fabricate and characterized BaLa4Ti4O15 (BLT) thick films and iii) to characterize the 

structured composites using dielectric spectroscopy and analytical electron microscopy 

and XR diffraction. 

 



49 

 

For that BNT (Ba4Nd9.33Ti18O54 ) and BLT (BaLa4Ti4O15) powders were 

synthesised, and suspension were prepared and optimised to ensure perfect electrophoretic 

deposition conditions, and BLT and BLT / BNT (and vice versa) composites were 

fabricated in this work. Due to the lack of information, BLT thick films were prepared by 

EPD for the first time and their properties evaluated. Simultaneously, and as a comparison 

tool, BLT ceramics were prepared from the same powders used to fabricate the thick films.

Chapter 4. Experimental Procedure 

 

Abstract 

In this chapter details of the experimental procedure used in this work are described which 

includes: i) the synthesis of BaLa4Ti4O15 (1:2:4) (BLT) and Ba4Nd9.33Ti18O54 (1:1:4) 

(BNT) powders, ii) preparation of the suspensions for the electrophoretic deposition and 

the studies of the suspension stability, iii) fabrication of thick films by EPD, iv) preparation 

of ceramics and v) description of films and ceramics characterization. 

 

4.1 Introduction  

The steps followed for the synthesis and characterization of Ba4Nd9.33Ti18O54 

(BNT), BaLa4Ti4O15 (1:2:4) (BLT) thick films and thick composites films of BNT - BLT is 

presented in the flowchart of Figure 4-1. 

 

As for the first step, BaLa4Ti4O15 (1:2:4) (BLT) and Ba4Nd9.33Ti18O54 (BNT) 

powders were prepared by conventional solid state method. Both powders were 

characterized in terms of their structure, phase purity and morphology. In the following 

steps, suspensions of BNT and BLT powders were prepared under different conditions and 

characterized in terms of stability in order to optimise the film deposition process. BLT 

and BNT thick films were deposited on platinum foil substrates by EPD and the processing 

variables were modified to change the final morphology and physical characteristics of the 

films. The deposited films were dried in air followed by iso static pressing and sintered at 

different temperatures. Structure, phase content and microstructure of the films were 

assessed by X Ray Diffraction and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The electrical 

response of the films was characterized by impedance spectroscopy as a function of 

temperature and frequencies (within the radio frequency range) and under different applied 

voltage. BLT ceramics were prepared to compare with films electrical response.

4.2 Synthesis of BLT and BNT Powders 

BaLa4Ti4O15 (1:2:4) (BLT) and Ba4Nd9.33Ti18O54 (1:1:4) (BNT) powders were 

synthesised by solid state reaction. The starting precursors,  BaCO3 (Aldrich, Product No.: 

513-77-9, purity&gt;99.9%), Nd2O3 (Aldrich, Product No.:1313-97-9, purity &gt;99.9%), La2O3 

(Aldrich, purity&gt;99.9%),) and TiO2 (Aldrich, Product No.:1317-80-2, purity &gt;99.9%), 

were weighted and mixed according to the correct stoichiometry. La2O3 and Nd2O3 are very 

hydroscopic in nature so, both the powders were heated at 850ºC for 3h, cooled down in 

desiccators and weighted immediately before mixing with the rest of the reagents. The 

mixed powders were ball milled in ethanol media, with zirconia balls for 24h followed by 

drying in oven at 100ºC for 12h. The dried powders were then taken out of the crucibles 

and grounded by using mortar and pestle. 

 

The grounded powder was calcined in a programmable furnace equipped with an 

automatic temperature controller. The temperature for calcination was chosen according to 

the results from Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) / Themogravimetry (TG), obtained 

with a heating rate of 5 ºC/min. The phase purity of the calcined powders was examined by 

using X-Ray Diffraction (equipped with EDS).

After calcination and phase purity examination, the powders were ball milled for 

24h at 180rpm to get small particle size, which is crucial for a good stability of the 

suspension and an improved green density of the film. The particle size distribution was 

determined by a Particle Size Analyzer (Coulter LS 230). The specific surface area of 

milled BLT and BNT powders was determined by BET(Gemini 2370 V5.00). The calcined 

milled powders were dried at 100ºC for 24h and kept inside the desiccators to avoid any 

reaction with air which could lead to the aging of the powders. The powders morphology 

was observed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Hitachi, S-4000 SEM / ED)  

 

4.3 Suspension Preparation and Suspension Medium 

Suspensions were prepared in different media such as water, acetone (&gt;99.9%, 

Merck) and ethanol (&gt;99.9%, Merck). For varying the pH of the media diluted HNO3 

(?99.8%, Aldrich) and triethanolamine (&gt;99%, Merck) were used.  

 

Suspension prepared in glass beaker with 1g of BLT or BNT powders were mixed 

in 100 ml of each of the suspension medium. The powders were slowly added into the 

suspension media under constant stirring by ultrasonication, to promote the dispersion of 

powders in the suspension. A further dispersion of the suspension was conducted by using 

magnetic stirring for approximately 1 to 2h. 

 

In order to increase the charge of the particles and to achieve high zeta potential 

values for the prepared suspensions, several additives such as dilute nitric acid and 

triethanolamine were analysed. 

 

EPD Apparatus   

 

The EPD set up used in this work is presented in Figure 4-2. It is composed of the 

EPD cell, the ultrasonic bath and the power source. The home made EPD cell consists of 

three main parts: the base, the mask and the metal pole for conductive connection. 

Platinum foils of 11 ×11 × 0.025 mm (99.95%, Good fellow, UK) were used as substrate 

for the film deposition and as counter electrode (cathode) as well. The substrates were 

placed between the each mask chambers and screwed from the back with the back lid. The 



54 

 

two equal masks were mounted on the base, and the two steel poles provided the electrical 

connection to the external power source. As represented in Figure 4-2 on the left side of 

the EPD cell is the ultrasonic bath (Branson, USA) and on right side the DC power source 

(EPS, Stromversorgung Gmbh, Germany); the EPD cell is located at the top of the 

magnetic stirrer. 

 

 

Figure 4-2: EPD setup in the left side and the EPD mask on the right side. 

 

4.4 Deposition of Films 

For film deposition, the EPD cell was immersed in the suspension in a 250 ml of 

glass beaker. The platinum foil as working electrode (cathode) was separated by 2 cm 

from the Pt counter electrode (anode) in the EPD cell. 

 

Prior to each EPD cycle the suspensions were ultrasonically dispersed and 

magnetically stirred (Yellowline, IKA Werke GmbH &amp;amp; Co. KG Germany) for 2 to 5 min, 

followed by settling for 1-2 min in order to settle down of coarse particles. 

 

Constant voltage and constant time mode was used in the current work to deposit 

BLT and BNT films on Platinum foil. The electric current through the EPD cell was 

monitored by a digital multimeter (MY-64, MASTECH, Hong Kong) located in series 

with the EPD circuit, during the EPD process. 

 



55 

 

 BNT/BLT and BLT/BNT composites films were fabricated on platinum substrate 

by electrophoretic deposition, as well. The deposition was carried out in acetone based 

suspension with triethanolamine as an additive for both systems. Composite films were 

deposited layer by layer, namely a BLT layer followed by a BNT layer and the other way 

around, a BNT layer followed by a BLT one. After each deposition and prior to the second 

deposition films were dried for at least one day in desiccators so that acetone evaporates 

slowly and minimise the formation of pores. A systematic diagram of the composite 

preparation is presented in Figure. 4-3. Isostatic pressing was not performed on the 

composite thick films because in many cases it leads to the peal off of the films.  

 

 
Figure 4-3: Schematic diagram of BNT/BLT thick film composite preparation. 

 

The geometrical density of green films was calculated by calculating the volume of 

the deposited film and measuring the weight of deposited film. The density is given by  

                                    ? = M / V                                                                      (4-1) 

where M stands for the mass of the film and V for the volume.  

 

4.5 Drying, Compaction and Sintering 

BLT, BNT and composites films were dried at room temperature for more than 

24h. Drying in air was preferred over a drying in the oven to let the solvent to evaporate 

slowly and to minimise the possibility of creating cracks. After drying, the films were iso-

statically pressed at 200 MPa for 3-5min to increase their green density.

The dried and compact films were further sintered at high temperature. To 

determine the sintering temperature for both systems dilatometric analysis of BLT and 

BNT pressed pellets (5x5x7 mm) were conducted in a computer assisted vertical 

dilatometer (Linseis, mod. 4 L70-2000).  

 

The thickness of the green and sintered films was measured by a micrometer and 

the film thickness error was calculated by taking the average of the first deposition 

thickness carried out at four different times in four fresh prepared suspension of BLT in 

acetone with triethanolamine. The calculated error associated with the film thickness is 

approximately ± 1.75µm  

 

4.6 Fabrication of Ceramics 

For comparison with films, BLT ceramic discs were prepared. The discs of 0.5g  

were uniaxially pressed at 50 MPa (Carver Laboratory Press, Fred S. Carver Inc., USA) 

and further isostatically pressed at 200MPa for a high and homogeneous green density. The 

pressed discs were sintered from 1400ºC to 1600ºC for different periods of time to assess 

the effect of the microstructure on the properties like permittivity, TC?r and loss tangent. 

Density of sintered discs was measured by Archimedes principle in diethyl phthalate 

(Fluke, 80080 with density of 1.118g/cm
3
). For dielectric measurements metal-insulator- 

metal geometry was used and top and bottom gold electrodes were deposited by thermal 

evaporation on the tops of the ceramic disk. 

 

4.7 Sample Characterization 

Structure and Microstructure 

The phase assemblage of the sintered BLT films and ceramics and BNT/BLT 

composite films was analysed by XRD. 

 

The microstructure evolution was followed by Scanning Electron Microscopy 

(SEM). For that cross-sections and surface morphologies of BLT, BNT, BNT/BLT and 



57 

 

BLT/BNT films were analyzed by a Hitachi S-4100 SEM coupled with energy dispersive 

spectroscopy (EDS). Film specimens were mounted on aluminium stubs using carbon glue. 

Carbon paint was applied to the specimen to provide a conductive path, and to avoid 

charging of the sample inside the microscope. These samples were investigated using an 

operation voltage of 25 kV.  

 

To view the cross section of films, a sandwich structure was constructed. The 

flexible films were supported by gluing a rigid alumina slide on both sides of the films. 

The supported film was fixed in to the epoxy resin for polishing. Films cross sections and 

fractured surfaces of the ceramic samples were polished by 1200 grade emery paper 

followed by a fine polishing in which sub sequential low grade diamond pastes (from 15 

?m, 6 ?m, 3 ?m, 1 ?m and 0.25 ?m) were used. After the polishing an acid mixture of 5% 

HF + 45% HCl in 50% of water was used to chemically etch the polished films cross 

sections and to contrast the grain boundaries. Finally, the as-etched samples were cleaned 

by ultrasonication in acetone. The polished ceramic samples were thermally etched at 

temperatures 100 ºC below the corresponding sintering temperature for 10 min. In case of 

films the surfaces were analysed without any treatment. 

 

Dielectric Characterization 

In this work, the electrical measurements at RF frequency were conducted via a 

metal-insulator-metal (MIM) configuration using Au as the top electrode for both films and 

ceramics. For the case of films, Au top circular electrodes were sputtered using a shadow 

mask of 0.6 mm diameter. Films of BNT, BLT and composites with top electrodes were 

post-annealed at 200 ºC for 30 min to improve the interface between the metal and the 

films. In BLT ceramics, top and bottom Au electrodes of 5.5 mm diameter were sputtered. 

 

The complex permittivity at RF frequency was measured as a function of 

temperature and frequency in capacitive cells as illustrated in Figure 4-4. The electrical 

properties were evaluated using an impedance bridge (HP 4284A, Agilent, USA) over a 

frequency range of 1 kHz to 1 MHz. The oscillation level of the applied voltage was set to 

1.0 V. The analysed electrical properties include the relative permittivity, loss tangent, 



58 

 

temperature dependence of permittivity (??r/?r0?T,) and relative permittivity-voltage 

variation (?r-V).

loss tangent for a typical dielectric (c) [1] 

 

Error Calculation  

Dielectric measurements were carried out in 5 to 6 different points along the film. 

The presented values of dielectric permittivity and dielectric losses correspond to the 

average of all the measurements and the error associate was calculated to be ± 3.9 for the 

dielectric permittivity and 0.0035 for the dielectric losses. 

Figure 4-5 and Table 4-1 present the dielectric permittivity values and losses for 

BLT films sintered at 1500ºC for 1h measured at six different points.

Characterization of BaLa4Ti4O15 and Ba4Nd9.33Ti18O54 Powders 

 

Abstract:  

In this chapter characterization of the BLT and BNT powder is discussed. The powders are 

characterized in term of its phase content, thermal behaviour, particle size distribution and 

morphology. 

 

5.1 Introduction:  

As discussed in the Chapter 6 of the thesis a key aspect of EPD is the stability of 

the suspension and charge state of the particles. This behaviour is intimately related with 

the morphology of the powder particles, what justifies the need of a complete 

characterization of the powders. In the meantime, as pointed in Chapter 5 the phase 

formation process in BNT and BLT systems is a complex process. In order to guarantee 

that BaLa4Ti4O15 (1:2:4) (BLT) and Ba4Nd9.33Ti18O54 (1:1:4) (BNT) powders have been 

synthesised the structural and phase assembly characterization is necessary. 

 

Results and Discussion 

5.2 DTA and TG 

 The mixed precursors of BLT and BNT were analysed by DTA and TG to obtain 

information on the approximated calcination temperature and Figure 5-1 represents the 

DTA and TG curves of both powders.  

 

Three main peaks are observed in the DTA curve of BNT and two main plateaus in 

the TG curve. The first endothermic peak near to 100
o
C corresponds to the dehydration of 

the starting reagents and is accompanied by the corresponding losses in the TG curve, until 

around 300ºC. A second quite diffuse exothermic peak ranging from 400 to almost 800
o
C 

corresponds to decomposition of carbon dioxide from BaCO3 and is accompanied by a 

marked decrease in the weight losses between 700 and 850ºC. A third peak exothermic 



61 

 

peak can be denoted between 900
o
C and 1000

o
C for which no weight loss is recorded and 

corresponds to the phase completeness of BNT phase formation.  

 

Four main peaks are observed in the DTA curve of BLT and three main plateaus in 

the TG curve. The first endothermic peak near to 100
o
C corresponds to the dehydration of 

the starting reagents and is accompanied by the corresponding losses in the TG curve. A 

second quite endothermic peak ranging from 390ºC which corresponds to the dehydration 

of La(OH)3 to form LaO3 and La2O2(CO3) which accompanied by the loss followed by a 

small weight gain in the TG curve. The third peak of around 1000
o
C corresponds to 

decomposition of carbon dioxide and is accompanied by a marked decrease in the weight 

losses between 900 and 1050ºC.  A small exothermic peak can be denoted between 1050
o
C 

and 1100
o
C for which no weight loss is recorded and corresponds to the phase 

completeness of BLT phase formation 

 

From the DTA / TG analysis the reaction between the starting precursors is 

completed before 1150°C for both the systems, so to ensure the synthesis of monophasic 

powders calcination temperatures from 1200
o
C to 1300

o
C were selected with a heating and 

cooling rate of 2
o
C/min and holding time of 3h-4h at the target temperature.

5.3 X-Ray Diffraction 

The phase purity of the powders was confirmed by the X-ray diffraction 

represented in Figure- 5-2 (a) for BNT and (b) BLT powders. In this work BNT 

monophasic powders were obtained at 1200
o
C/3h and monophasic BLT achieved at 

1300
o
C/3h. The effect of the calcination temperature on the phase formation of BLT is 

represented in Figure 5-2(c). The XRD plot shows the presence of BaTiO3, La2Ti2O7 and 

La2TiO5 phases at 1200
o
C with the increase of calcination temperature all the phases 

reacted to form BaLa4Ti4O15, the peaks corresponding to pure phase BLT can be seen from 

the XRD taken above 1200
o
C but the other phases are also present until 1275

o
C (Figure 5-

2 (c)). Monophasic BLT powders were obtained at 1300ºC. The obtained results for the 

formation of BLT are corroborated by the results reported by Ohsato et al. [1] for BLT 

powders prepared by molten salt synthesis. The systematic reaction of the various phases 

to produce pure BLT is given in Table 5-1.

5.4 Particle Size Distribution and Morphology of Powder 

Particle size distribution plays an important role in the stability of the suspension 

and on the green density of the films. 

 

The particle size distribution is depicted in Figure 5-3 for BNT and BLT and both 

powders are characterised by a bimodal distribution. The powders are smaller than 5 

micron with the highest volume percentage of particles is around 2.5 micron with a 

fraction of small particles below 1 micron. In comparison BLT powders possess a slight

higher volume percentage of bigger particles than BNT powders. In agreement, the specific

and 4.996 m²/g, respectively. The morphology of the particles is depicted in the SEM 

micrographs of Figure 5-4; clearly BLT particles are bigger than the BNT ones and exhibit 

a more or less platelet like shape when compared with the rod like morphology of BNT.

5.5 Dilatometeric Measurement  

Dilatometry analysis of BNT and BLT powders is illustrated in Figure 5-5 which 

depicts the change in the length (?l/l0 x 100%, l0 stands for the initial length and ?l for the 

variation of the length) with the temperature. For both compositions after the initial 

expansion, shrinkage starts at around 1250ºC and 1100ºC and finished at 1500
o
C and 

1400
o
C respectively for BLT and BNT powders. This is a clear indication of the different 

sintering behaviour of BNT and BLT that will be reflected in the densification of the 

corresponding ceramics and films, in particular the composite films. 

 

 For BLT ceramics and BLT films the sintering temperatures were selected from 

1400ºC to 1600ºC with heating rate of 2ºC/min to study the effect of processing. BNT 

films were sintered at 1450ºC/1h. In case of BNT-BLT composites in-between 

temperatures from 1450-1550 were selected for sintering.

Fabrication of BaLa4Ti4O15 and Ba6-3xNd8+2xTi18O54 (x=2/3) Thick 

Films by Electrophoretic Deposition 

 

Abstract: 

In this chapter, a comprehensively discussion on the fabrication of BLT and BNT films by 

EPD is presented. Suspensions based on water, ethanol, and acetone were employed and 

analyzed for the electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of BLT and BNT powders. The effect of 

suspension additives on film’s deposition is studied. It is observed that ethanol with HNO3 

and acetone with triethanolamine are suitable suspension media for the deposition of BLT 

thick films, while in case of BNT, optimised deposited films, are achieved when acetone 

with triethanolamine is used. .The suspension stability behaviour is studied by means of 

the particle size distribution, UV transmittance and zeta potential. The deposition 

parameters like voltage and time and a post deposition isostatic press step are analysed in 

order to control the final thickness and green density of the films. 

 

6.1 Introduction 

As described in Chapter 2, the fabrication of thick films with optimised properties 

depends on factors, such as stability, zeta potential, viscosity and dielectric constant of the 

suspension and applied voltage and deposition time (inter alia), it is important to study this 

parameter. 

 

In a previous work of the present group the fabrication by EPD of BNT(1:1:5) thick 

films was reported [1]. It was observed that in terms of films quality (Figure 6-1) the 

optimised properties were achieved for acidic media in acetone containing iodine with 

dielectric properties superior than BNT ceramics. It was than proved the applicability of 

EPD for the fabrication of functional thick films, what was viewed as the step forward for 

the miniaturisation of the microwave devices.  

 

However the fabrication of BLT thick films by EPD has not yet been reported. It is 

then very opportune and scientifically and technically interesting to prove the adequacy of 



68 

 

the use of EPD to fabricate low loss BLT thick films and to compare their properties with 

those of BNT thick films on metal foils.

6.2 Experiments 

 BLT and BNT powders were used to prepare the suspensions for EPD. The 

fabrication, morphology and characterization of the powders were discussed in detail in the 

experimental Chapters 4 and 5. 

 

BLT and BNT (1:1:4) powder suspensions were prepared in acetone, ethanol and 

water. And additives such as nitric acid and triethanolamine were used to vary the pH of 

the suspension from acidic to basic and to vary the particle charges. The stability of each of 

these suspensions was inspected by UV transmittance spectroscopy and particle size 

analysis. For all the suspension media the suspensions prepared for transmittance 

spectroscopy had a similar concentration, which is an important requisite for a comparative 

analysis. The films were deposited under constant time and constant voltage.

Results and Discussion 

6.3 The Role of Suspension Media in the Deposition of BLT and BNT Thick Films 

Some physical properties (like viscosity, dielectric constant) of the suspension 

media used in this work (acetone, ethanol and water) are indicated in Table 6-1, together 

with the macroscopic observation regarding the deposition. It was observed that with the 

application of voltage, BLT and BNT particles move to negative electrode for organic 

based medium where as for water based suspension no movement was observed.  

 

Power et al. [2] stated that for solvents with low dielectric constant the dissociative 

charging mode is insufficient and as a consequence no deposition occurs; however in the 

presence of high dielectric constant solvents the ionic concentration increases in the 

suspension, reduces the size of the double layer region and consequently the stability, 

therefore non aqueous media with medium dielectric constant such as acetone and ethanol, 

are in general effective for EPD.  

 

Under the current EPD experiments the solid loading is quite low so the viscosity 

cannot be used as a parameter to evaluate the dispersion state [4-5].

The pH of water based suspensions and operational pH of the organic-based 

suspensions were measured by means of a pH meter. The operational pH of the BLT and 

BNT suspension in ethanol and acetone was controlled by additions of diluted nitric acid 

(1:10) and triethanolamine (&gt;99.8%, Merck). The pH values for BNT and BLT suspension 



70 

 

media are indicated in Table 6-2, the pH value for pure acetone and ethanol is 7.97 and 

7.09 respectively.

The variation of pH was conducted to enhance the concentration of positive and 

negative charged ions in the suspension to achieve high zeta potential values, required for 

an optimised deposition. 

 

As an example, the zeta potential curve of BLT powders in ethanol is illustrated in 

Figure 6-2. The zeta potential for pH values 2-3 is near to 58mV, which means a high 

mobility of the particles in suspension and may result in a good deposition. As the pH 

increases the zeta potential decreases and the isoelectric point is attained for pH values of

A good deposition was observed for BLT in ethanol based suspensions with pH 

value near to 2 as can be seen from the optical image of films morphology depicted in 

Figure 6-3. For BNT in acidic media no deposition was observed.  

 

 
Figure 6-3: Surface morphology of BLT films deposited in ethanol suspension media with HNO3, 

under 100V for 1min  

 

In acetone based suspensions no deposition was observed for acidic media but for 

the basic media with pH 8-8.9 very good deposition was observed for both BLT and BNT 

systems, as can be seen in optical image depicted in Figures 6-4 and 6-5.  

 

To study the electrophoretic deposition of BLT and BNT particles with basic pH, 

triethanolamine as an additive was used in acetone based suspensions. The choice of 

acetone over ethanol was made based on their pH values; pure acetone shows pH of 7.97 

and with the addition of BNT particles the pH values increase for the BNT near to 8.2. In 

case of ethanol media, with the addition of BLT particles the pH of the suspension shifts 

towards lower value 6.51 (acidic), so by taking pH behaviour in account acetone was 

preferred over ethanol for basic deposition. 

  

The zeta potential for BNT and BLT in pure acetone is 16.6mV and 15mV 

respectively. To enhance the surface charge on the particles triethanolamine was added to 

BNT and BLT suspension which further increase the suspension pH to 8.90 and 8.50 

respectively (Table 6-2). 

 

For the basic suspensions, i.e. acetone with triethanolamine, the deposition 

occurred at the negative electrode. In order to understand the mechanism behind the charge 



72 

 

process of BNT and BLT particles under these basic conditions zeta potential curves 

should be acquired, but due to experimental limitations of the equipment available at the 

University of Aveiro, these curves could only be obtained in water. However similar good 

anodic depositions were reported in the work of Widegren et al. [7] for the deposition of 

Al2O and TiO2 particles in ethanol based suspension with triethanolamine.

triethanolamine, under 60V for 1 min. 

 

 

 
Figure 6-5: Surface morphology of BNT films deposited in acetone suspension media with 
triethanolamine, under 60V for 1min.  

 

It is worthwhile to note here that no deposition was observed in the case of water, 

pure ethanol and pure acetone based suspensions. The reasons behind these occurrences 

cannot be easily evaluated because of the complexity of EPD and are still a matter of 

debate. 



73 

 

However the following analysis can contribute to explain some of these 

observations. 

6.4 Suspension Stability 

The particle size distribution in different media (water, ethanol and acetone) is 

depicted in Figure 6-6 for the BLT system. As expected BLT particles show dissimilar 

dispersion characteristics in the different suspension media. The stability analysis was 

performed in water as well, so that it can be used as a reference. A bimodal distribution 

was observed for all the suspension media under study with and without additives. 

However the volume percentage of particles varied for each media. A lower percentage of 

particles in the range of 2 to 6µm and a higher percentage of particles in the range below 

1µm were observed in organic media when compared with the water based one. This 

clearly indicates that the tendency for particle agglomeration in water is higher than in 

organic media, supporting the better stability of BLT powders in organic suspensions. The 

addition of additives in acetone and ethanol further increase the volume percentage of 

smaller size particles as expected, which assures a good EPD.

For BNT suspensions, considerable changes can be distinguished for the case of 

organic suspension media acetone as compared to water presented in Figure 6-7. Similarly 

to BLT, BNT suspensions exhibit a bimodal distribution in all the suspension media. 

However in water the volume percentage of particles in the range between 2 and 6.5?m is 

higher and lower for the submicron range when compared with the other suspension 

media; a narrower distribution was indeed observed for the acetone based suspension, 

where the highest volume percentage of particles are smaller than 0.6?m. The addition of 

triethanolamine to acetone did not provoke a marked effect on the particle size distribution, 

just a minor increase in the volume percentage of the small size particles.

To prepare a well dispersed BLT and BNT suspension for EPD and to obtain a 

dense coating, a fine particle size suspension is required and BLT suspensions in ethanol 

and acetone and BNT suspension in acetone with additives present indeed relatively good 

results then in ethanol. 

 

The stability of the suspensions with time was further studied by UV transmittance. 

The transmission results in acetone, ethanol and water suspension with and without 

additives for both systems are plotted in Figure 6-8 (a) and (b). 

 

As high the transmission value is, as less stable the suspension will be. For BLT 

ethanol based suspensions, the transmittance percentage was 28% for the case of water, 

23% in ethanol and 22 % in ethanol with HNO3 addition. The waiting time was of 1 minute 

before every measurement. The lower transmission observed in the case of ethanol based 

suspension indicates a better dispersion of the particles in suspension and corroborates the 

results of the particle size distribution, presented above. The transmittance percentage 

increases with time for all the suspensions which is related with the sedimentation of the 

suspended particles as the time passes. However, this increase is less visible for the case of 

the water based suspension due to the fact that, under the same experimental conditions, 



76 

 

the amount of the coarse particles in suspension is very few in the water based suspensions, 

because they settled almost immediately, i.e. in the first seconds of settling.  

For BLT in acetone based suspensions, the transmittance decreases from 20 % to 

12% with the addition of triethanolamine which indicates a very good dispersion degree of 

the suspension as compared to the suspension without additives, as previously observed for 

the other additives, what ensures a good stability for the BLT suspension in acetone with 

triethanolamine. These observations validate the results obtained from the particle size 

distribution in which the volume percentage of small sized particles slightly increases with 

the addition of triethanolamine. 

 

The transmittance results demonstrate that in ethanol and acetone based 

suspensions of BLT, some particles settle down after 7-10 min which might not be a matter 

of concern as deposition is carried out immediately after stirring and in the first few 

minutes of the settling of the suspension.

The stability behaviour of BNT suspensions in different suspension media is 

depicted in Figures 6-9. As observed for BLT, BNT water based suspension presents the 

highest transmittance values, indicating the less stable suspension when compared with 

equivalent suspensions in acetone and ethanol. Indeed, the transmittance percentage of 

BNT drops from 27% in water to 11% in acetone and acetone with additives. In 

suspensions with additives the particles stay stable for longer periods of time as compared 

to the ones without additives, ensuring better suspension stability for the EPD. The very 

small differences in the transmittance percentage between BNT acetone based suspensions 

with and without additives are in good agreement with the particle size distribution results 

(Figure 6-7) in which the volume percentage of the particles distributed in both media is 

almost equal. 

 

The above presented results of particle size analysis and UV transmittance gave a 

clear idea about the stability of the organic based suspensions and about their 

appropriateness to be used in the flowing steps of the film deposition.

6.5 The Role of the Deposition Parameters on the EPD of BLT and BNT Thick Films  

As well documented in the introduction there are several processing variables that 

affect the properties and quality of the deposited films. The knowledge of the effect of 

these variables is crucial to control the kinetics and the deposition process and the final 

characteristics of the films. For that, BLT and BNT films were deposited under varied 

deposition conditions, namely voltage and time. 

 

The effect of the deposition voltage and time for BLT in ethanol with HNO3 

additions is presented in Figure 6-10, in which the variation of the film thickness is plotted 

against the time for a fixed deposition voltage and plotted against the voltage, for a fixed 

deposition time.  

 

For constant voltage with time the film thickness increases linearly until 60µm and 

then starts to deviate from linearity for longer deposition times. The observed deviation is 

due to the decrease in the electric field between the electrodes because of deposited layer 

of particles on the substrate or to the change in the charge concentration of the suspension 

as the deposition goes on [5]. For constant time and varying deposition voltage the 

thickness of film increased more or less linearly for the voltage range from 60 to120V and 



79 

 

deviates from this linear behaviour for higher voltages. It is well known that with the 

increase of the deposition voltage the particles will be animated of high velocities and will 

travel very fast towards the counter charged electrode deteriorating the packing of the 

particles on the substrate and limiting the film thickness increase and the deposition of a 

closed packed structure. In addition the increased voltage may cause turbulence in the 

suspension, which results in non uniform surface and bulk films [6]. It was even observed 

that at high voltage the films tend to peeled off from the substrate.

Figure 6-10: Deposited thickness of BLT films in ethanol with diluted nitric acid as a function of (a) 

constant voltage (b) constant time. 

 

The topography of films deposited in ethanol was not uniform and especially for 

high film thickness as shown in Figure 6-3. The geometrical density of green films 

deposited in ethanol suspension was in between 26% to 32% of theoretical density. 

 

The effect of the deposition voltage and deposition time on the properties of BLT 

films was carried out in basic media, as well. 

 

Figure 6-11 represents the variation of BLT film thickness as a function of voltage 

and time for acetone with triethanolamine suspension media. As previously observed the 

thickness of the films deposited under constant voltage (60 V) for varied deposition times 

and under fixed deposition time (1 min) for varied deposition voltages, increases for initial 

deposition time and voltage and then the rate of thickness decreases as the deposition time 

or deposition voltage increases. Under 60V the maximum thickness achieved under the 

present conditions was about 55µm for 120sec and for longer deposition times the films 

peeled off from the substrate.

This non linear behaviour is further supported by the results depicted for BLT in 

Figure 6-12, in which the variation of the suspension electric current is measured during 

the deposition and the deposit weight is plotted against the deposition time. For both 

variables the variation is asymptotical, indicating a decrease of the rate of the variation. 

The decrease of the rate of the deposit weight with time can be explained, on one hand by 

the decrease in the particle velocity with time related with the decrease of the current in the 

suspension media as the deposition time passes, on the other hand as a result of the 

deposited mass on the electrode which acts as a shield for the incoming particles [5]. The 

current was dropped from 7.9mA to 7.5mA with time because of the insulating layer 

created by deposited particles on the substrate.  

 

BLT films derived from acetone with triethanolamine and presented in Figure 6-4 

exhibit more uniform surface topography than BLT films derived from ethanol with nitric 

acid suspension media. The geometrical density of green films deposited from acetone 

with triethanolamine was in the range of 42% to 48% of theoretical density, considerably 

higher than the density of the BLT films prepared from the ethanol based suspension by 

approximately 10%.

As mentioned before the fabrication of BNT films was thoroughly studied in 

previous works of this group [1] and in this thesis the preparation of BNT thick films was 

carried out only as a mean to achieve optimised fabrication of BNT / BLT and BLT / BNT 

thick composite films. BNT deposition was carried out in acetone with the addition of 

triethanolamine and under high pH values. Very uniform deposits were formed at the 

negative electrode in a similar way to the BLT system under basic conditions. 

 

The deposition parameters like, voltage, current and time were analysed to control 

the films properties. In Figure 6-13 film thickness is plotted as a function of time and 

applied voltage for constant applied voltage and time respectively. A similar variation to 

the previously described BLT behaviour is observed. This nonlinearity in the thickness 

variation was also reported for other systems like ZnO by Wang et al. [6].  

 

The deposited weight and suspension electric current as a function of the deposition 

time are depicted in Figure 6-14. With the increase of deposition weight the current 

decreases which is due to the deposition of the powder insulating layer on the substrate. 

 

The geometrical green density of the films was in between 46-50 % of theoretical 

density. The optical microstructure of the BNT films illustrated in Figure 6-5, evidences a 

very good surface morphology.

Figure 6-14: Deposited weight and suspension current as a function of time for BNT in acetone 

suspension with triethanolamine. 

It is very important to have uniform topography and crack free surfaces to 

guarantee optimised film’s properties. It was observed that with the increase of the green 

film thickness the surface become more inhomogeneous and after sintering some cracks 

were formed as shown in Figure 6-15. For thickness lower than 50µm the surfaces of the 

films were uniform and crack free after and before sintering. The cause of cracking in the 

case of higher thickness film may be due to development of stresses during the constrained 

sintering process, to the increased non uniformity of the green microstructure of the films 

as the film thickness increases and also to drying step that is more difficult in the thick than 

in the thin films.

6.6 Post Deposition Treatment 

In generally, EPD process produces a porous layer of compacted powder and in 

order to enhance the density of the films, a post-deposition cold isostatic pressing (CIP) 

step was employed. 

 

Although alternative approaches to enhance the sintered density of the films can be 

used, that include increasing the sintering temperature or introducing liquid phase sintering 

aids, these are not so attractive for the present studies. Due to the thermal expansion 

mismatch between the films and the substrate increasing the sintering temperatures will 

invariably lead to the formation of cracks and for case of sintering aids the dielectric losses 

can easily increase. 

 

Figure 6-16 illustrates the SEM micrographs of BLT and BNT films sintered at 

1450º/6h and 1450ºC/1h without and with CIP treatment at 200 MPa, respectively. The 

lower porosity of the CIP films is clearly seen when compared to the non CIP films. The 

dielectric properties of the corresponding films are depicted in Figure 6-17; the permittivity 

decreases and losses increases by factor of 5 to 10 for both BLT and BNT films prepared 

without CIP step. The CIP step is proved to be very effective in terms of green 

densification and, as a consequence, in terms of final dielectric response.

6.7 Conclusion 

BLT and BNT thick films were successfully deposited on the platinum substrates 

by EPD.  

 

Because the mechanism of EPD involves charged particles in a suspension being 

deposited onto an electrode under the influence of an applied electric field two groups of 

parameters determine the characteristics of this process: (i) those related to the suspension, 

and (ii) those related to the process including the physical parameters such as the electrical 

nature of the electrodes, the electrical conditions (voltage/intensity relationship, deposition 

time, etc.).  

 

In this chapter the role of suspension media and of deposition parameters (such as 

voltage and time) was assessed in the deposition of BLT and BNT thick films. 

It was verified that BLT thick films can be successfully deposited either in acidic 

and basic media of ethanol and acetone, respectively. However BNT, films were only 

obtained in basic suspension media of acetone with triethanolamine. Diluted nitric acid and 



89 

 

triethanolamine were used to vary the pH of the suspension and proved to be very useful in 

controlling the stability of the suspension and the quality of the deposit. 

 

Low pH ethanol with nitric acid suspensions and high pH acetone with 

thriethanolamine suspensions are quite stable and allow a good dispersion of the powders 

particles, as indicated by the particle size distribution and UV transmittance studies. 

 

For both systems the relation between the processing parameters (deposition 

voltage and time) and physical characteristics of green films was established. Under the 

present conditions films with thickness up to 80µm can be fabricated for both the systems 

with application of constant voltage and varying the deposition time, being the films with 

thickness up to 50µm characterised by very uniform morphologies. 

 

With CIP, the films are denser and exhibit approximately 20% higher permittivity 

than films without CIP; this proves that CIP is an essential step to ensure thick films good 

properties.

Microstructure and Dielectric Characterization of BaLa4Ti4O15 

Ceramics and Films 

  

Abstract: 

In this chapter, the microstructure and the dielectric response of BLT and BNT thick films 

are presented and the relationship between processing, microstructure and dielectric 

response established. Since BLT thick films are prepared for the first time in this work, 

BLT ceramics are fabricated as well and their dielectric properties compared. For 

equivalent sintering temperature it is observed that the grain growth in films is more 

anisotropic because of the film’s constrained sintering. As a consequence, the dielectric 

permittivity is higher in films (by 11 %) when compared with ceramics where grains are 

more randomly distributed, at this sintering temperature. The losses measured for BLT 

ceramics and films, in this work are more or less 0.002 at 1MHz frequency. 

 

 The microstructure and electrical properties of BNT films were not addressed in 

this work because it had been previously a research topic in the group [8].  

 

7.1 Introduction 

It is well known that the processing steps of the material will affect its final 

microstructure and, as a consequence, the final dielectric properties. The establishment of 

the relationships between the processing, microstructure and properties is crucial for the 

understanding and control of the material response and for its application and 

commercialization, as well.  

 

 In addition in view of the fact that BLT thick films have not yet been reported in 

the literature and generally the properties of films are inferior to the properties of the 



91 

 

equivalent bulk ceramics, the dielectric response of BLT thick films and BLT ceramics is 

analysed and compared. 

Despite the technological interest of BLT ceramics with a ?r of 44, TC?r near zero 

and Qf above 44,000 [5], systematic studies on the processing of BLT ceramics are still not 

thoroughly described in the literature. The dielectric properties of BLT systems have been 

reported by several groups as mentioned in Chapter 1, and the discussions have been 

mainly focused on the tunning of tf without degrading the ?r and Qf of the material. Colla 

et al [2] and Reaney et al. [3] have shown that tf varies strongly in accordance with the 

proximity of room temperature due to phase transitions that involve tilting or rotation of 

´O´ octahedral unit of the structure this studies were conducted on SrTiO3 and LaAlO3 

solid solution. In Ca5Nb2TiO12 and related compounds the variation of TC?r with sintering 

temperature was observed by Bendershy et al. [4]. The explanation for the variation of 

TC?r is associated with the disordering of the crystal, which was studied by HRTEM. 

 

Results and Discussion 

7.2 Microstructure Characterization of Ceramics 

Figure 7-1 presents the SEM micrographs of the sintered ceramics. BLT ceramics 

sintered between 1400 and 1600 ºC present quite dense microstructures and are 

characterised by anisotropic grains. The density of the ceramics increases until 1500 ºC 

and then decreases for the samples sintered at higher temperatures and it is related with the 

presence of porosity, which can be seen in the SEM micrographs (Figure 7-1); 

corresponding density is given in Table 7-1. The grain anisotropy increases with the 

increase of the sintering temperature as corroborated by the calculated aspect ratio of the 

grains that varies from 3 to 24 with the sintering temperature. For the sintering 

temperatures up to 1500ºC the longest grain dimension varies between 5 to 20 µm and it 

increases drastically with the sintering temperature to 52µm. Concomitantly the density of 

the sample decreases for the highest sintering temperatures because of this abnormal 

anisotropic grain growth which results in the entrapment of some pores inside the grains. 

The anisotropic behaviour of BLT (1:1:4) ceramics was also observed by Fukami et al [7] 

and Reaney et al [5].

 Figure 7-2 presents the EDS spectra of BLT ceramics sintered at 1450ºC/6h that 

confirms the ceramic composition and indicates that no extra phases are present. Chemical 

elemental mapping was performed on these ceramics and it was observed that some 

specific grains are rich in Ba and Ti and deficient in La, as shown in Figure 7-3. To have a 

clear picture about this distribution back scattered electron spectroscopy was performed 

and in some regions a few grains have a slightly different light contrast (Figure 7-4), what 

seems to corroborate the observations of the elemental mapping. Due to the XRD detection 

limits ( ~ 3% volume) this compositional variation was not observed by XRD and it was 

not possible, with the available resources to identify the stoichiometry of this BLT phase. 

Similar findings were reported by Okawa et al [6] for this composition.

Electrical Characterization of BLT Ceramics  

Figure 7-5 (a) and (b) represents the dielectric permittivity and losses as a function 

of frequency and temperature for BLT sintered ceramics. With the increase of the sintering 

temperature the dielectric permittivity increased until the sintering temperature of 1500 ºC; 

for further augment of the sintering temperature the abnormal grain growth occurs 

resulting in lower density (Table 7-1 and Figures 7-5(a)) and as a consequence in lower 

dielectric permittivity. 

 

The relative dielectric permittivity previously reported [3-12] ranges from 44 to 

49.1 in GHz frequency. In this work the maximum permittivity of BLT ceramic was 51 at 

1MHz frequency for ceramic sintered at 1500ºC/6h with a relative density of 96%. The 

reason of high relative permittivity may be related with the size of the grains and their 

distribution. For ceramics sintered at 1500º C the grain sizes varies from 2 to 20µm in the 

longest axis of grain and has higher density compared to ceramics sintered at higher and 

lower temperatures.  

 

 The losses were measured at 1 MHz and varied between 0.009 and 0.001. The 

comparison with the literature reports is difficult since the reported values correspond to 

the MW range. 

 

 The permittivity of the BLT ceramics varies almost linearly with temperature as 

shown in Figure 7-5(b), which is good from the application point of view.

The observed behaviour of the temperature coefficient of the relative permittivity 

(TC?r) as a function of processing temperature is highly unusual and according to the 

authors knowledge was not reported in the literature until now. There is a double-crossing 

of zero TC?r with the processing temperature as depicted in Figure 7-6. The temperature 

dependence of the relative permittivity (TC?r) changes from a positive (TC?r of 

15.3ppm/ºC for the sample sintered at 1400ºC) to a negative value (TC?r about -38ppm/ºC 

for the sample sintered at 1500ºC) and again changes to a positive one with the increase of 

the sintering temperature. 

 

A similar observation was reported by Cava et al. [4] for the system Ca5Nd2TiO12 

(Figure7-7). The reason for the variation of TC?r was suggested to be related with the 

ordering of cations in the B sites which was studied by HTEM. Cava found that the degree 

of B sites cation ordering is higher in ceramics sintered at intermediate temperatures as 

when compared with ceramics sintered at low and high temperature where TC?r have high 

positive values. 

 

It is worth to mention, that this finding might be very useful for the tailoring the 

TC?r to near zero of BLT ceramics. However further studies of the microstructure and 

crystallographic nature of BLT ceramics, that are out of the aim of this thesis, are needed 

to understand these observations.

7.3 Microstructure Characterization of BLT Films  

The SEM micrographs of 10µm thick BLT films deposited in acetone based 

suspensions and iso statically pressed are illustrated in Figure 7-8.  

 

Films were sintered at 1400ºC to 1600ºC and as the sintering temperature increases 

films become denser, which can be seen from the SEM micrograph, the grain size along 

the longest axis increases from 2 to 30µm with the sintering temperature (presented in 

Table 7-2).

Figure 7-9 illustrates the cross sections of BLT films sintered at1450ºC/1h, 

showing that the bounding between the substrate and the film is quite good. The EDS was 

performed on these films to inspect the presence of secondary elements (Figure 7-10) and 

no extra elements besides BLT composition were detected.

Electrical Characterization of BLT Films  

The variation of the relative permittivity and losses as a function of frequency and 

temperature for BLT films sintered at 1400ºC to 1600ºC for 1hour are depicted in Figure 7-

11. With the increase of the sintering temperature there is a decrease in the porosity (Figure 

7-8), an increase in the dielectric permittivity and the losses approached to zero. The 

maximum permittivity of about 57.5 was achieved for films sintered at 1600ºC/1h and with 

loss tangent lower than 0.002 at 1 MHz frequency. The permittivity doesn’t vary much 

with increasing temperature from 30 to 100ºC (Figure 7-11(b)), that is an essential 

characteristic in microwave applications in terms of frequency selectivity. The poor 

properties of films sintered at lower temperature are due to the higher porosity as compared 

to the films sintered at high temperatures.  

 

 



104 

 

The calculated TC?r are summarised in Table 7-3. TC?r remains positive and 

approaches to zero as the sintering temperature of the film increases; TC?r varies from 

+103ppm/ºC to +30ppm/ºC for BLT films sintered from

1450ºC to 1600ºC. This behaviour might be related with details of the microstructure or 

modifications of the degree of ordering as suggested by [4]. Indeed, it was reported that 

TC?r of BNT thick films approaches to zero with the increase of the sintering temperature 

or aspect ratio of the film [11]. 

 

The dielectric permittivity and loss tangent of different thick BLT films and 

ceramics sintered at 1450ºC for 6h represented in Figure 7-12 as a function of frequency. It 

can be seen that, with the increase of the film thickness, from 13 to 30 µm the dielectric 

properties approach to wards those of the ceramics. In fact, in thick films the contribution 

of the film bulk to the dielectric response is higher than in a thin film, diluting the 

contribution of any interfacial layer between the film and the substrate, usually deleterious 

to the film dielectric response. On the other hand, as the bulk thickness of the film 

increases the effect of the constrained sintering becomes diluted as well, and the grain 

growth and grain orientation in this case becomes more similar to the bulk microstructure.

7.4 BLT Films and Ceramics Comparison  

Table 7-3 summarises the properties of BLT films and ceramics prepared under the 

current work. In general the dielectric response of BLT films doesn’t differ too much from 

the ones of BLT ceramics, in terms of dielectric permittivity and dielectric losses. However 

the main differences reside in the temperature coefficient of the dielectric permittivity.  

 

At low sintering temperature the permittivity of ceramics is higher than the 

equivalent films what might be due to the high degree of porosity of the films. On the other 

hand films sintered at 1550 and 1600ºC present higher dielectric permittivity what might 

be related with the anisotropy of the microstructure and with the change in grain size.  

 

Reaney et al. [5] reported the dependence of the electrical response on the 

anisotropy of the microstructure of BLT ceramics. The dielectric permittivity is higher by 

20 % when measured in perpendicular direction of pressing than in parallel direction of 

pressing. Similar findings were observed for BNT films with needle shape like 

morphology by Fu Zhi et al. [8] and attributed to the constrained sintering which promotes 

to elongated growth of the grains. Similar behaviour in terms of dielectric response and 

microstructure was also observed for other compounds such as Bi4Ti3O12 [9], PbBi4Ti4O15 

and Pb2Bi4Ti5O18 [10].  

 

Concerning TC?r the variation between films and ceramics and its dependence on 

the sintering temperature is appreciable. As well reported in the literature TC?r depends on 

many aspects, namely on tolerance factor [3], ordering of B sites cations with change in the 

sintering temperature [4] and aspect ratio of the grain size [11] what might affect in a 

similar way the TC?r of thick films. However, for the case of films, on top of that one 

needs to consider the changes induced by the constrained sintering, either the residual 

porosity or the altered degree of the microstructure anisotropy when compared with 

equivalent ceramics. The analysis of the variation of TC?r in films becomes more difficult 

and in order to distinguish between the possible contributions to this variation systematic 



107 

 

studies are necessary, that were out of the objective of this master thesis and are currently 

under investigation.  

 

Noteworthy here, is the observation that the variation of TC?r in films is very 

dependent on the processing conditions and the full understand of this variation in order to 

tailor the final properties of the films is essential for the complete exploitation of the 

possible commercial applications for thick films of MW materials.

7.5 Conclusion 

 BLT thick films and ceramics possess typical microstructures in which anisotropic 

grain growth took place with the increasing sintering temperature. In general BLT thick 

films are less dense than equivalent ceramics. 

 

The dielectric permittivity, dielectric losses and temperature coefficient of the 

permittivity of 10µm thick BLT films sintered at 1600ºC are 58, 0.002 and +30ppm/ºC at 

1MHz, respectively. A maximum relative permittivity of 51, loss tangent of 0.002 and 

TC?r of -17ppm/ºC at 1MHz were obtained for BLT ceramics sintered at 1500ºC. 

 

In comparison with BLT ceramics the dielectric response is quite similar in terms 

of dielectric permittivity and dielectric losses, being the small differences attributed to the 

density and to the constrained sintering that takes place in thick films. With the increase of 

thickness the dielectric behaviour of BLT films approach to the one of equivalent ceramics. 



108 

 

However, appreciable differences were observed in terms of TC?r and its dependence on 

the sintering temperature. TC?r of BLT films sintered between 1450ºC and 1600ºC 

decrease from 103ppm/ºC to 30ppm/ºC, while for the case of ceramics it first decreases 

with the sintering temperature and then increases. These results are particularly relevant 

because they clearly show the dependence of TC?r on the processing parameters and the 

differences between bulk ceramics and thick films. The effect of the processing on TC?r 

variation is complex and many variables seem to play a role, including the anisotropy 

growth of the grains and ionic disorder. Because of that the reasons behind this difference 

are not clear at the moment. This understanding is fundamental and will open opportunities 

to developed materials with tailored responses.

Characterization of BaLa4Ti4O15 and Ba4Nd9.33Ti18O54 Composite 

Thick Films by Electrophoretic Deposition 

 

Abstract:  

In this chapter, the fabrication of composite thick films of BNT/BLT and BLT/BNT by 

electrophoretic deposition is described. The composite thick films are characterized by 

SEM and EDS to study the uniformity of the deposition and composition respectively. 

Dielectric response is assessed at 1 MHz.  

 

8.1 Introduction 

As mentioned before, there is a gap in terms of dielectrics between high 

permittivity (low Qf) and low permittivity (high Qf) materials suitable for specific 

microwave applications (Figure 3-1). Currently no commercial material with near zero ?f, 

high Qf and permittivity between 45-80 is available [1]. 

 

One of the approaches that is being considered to tailor the dielectric response of 

MW ceramics and namely to obtain tf near zero is to conjugate in the same material end 

members compositions with opposite sign of tf. Ceramic composites of near zero tf have 

been prepared in the systems of CaTiO3-NdAlO3 and ZrTiO4-ZnNd2O6 by solid state 

reaction [2-3]. Zheng et al. [1] successfully prepared composites of BaLa4Ti4O15 and 

Ba4Nd9.33Ti18O54 by solid state reaction and reported tf ~ -20ppm/ºC, Qf 10,000GHz and 

permittivity of ~ 61, for the xBNT-(1-x)BLT (0?x?0.75) composite. To achieve high 

density and to decrease the processing costs of this composite materials the same group 

used a glass composition (B2O3-Bi2O3-ZnO-SiO2 (BBZS) as a sintering aid and 

successfully decrease the sintering temperature by 350ºC from 1500ºC [4]. 

 

As a bulk material the most stringent properties needed to be used as MW resonator 

and filters, are Qf &gt;40,000 GHz and tf near zero. For antenna core technology, the less 

stringent requirement for Qf and tf due to metallisation dominates the dielectric loss 

broadening the resonant frequency. The vast array of different antenna frequencies requires 

materials with 20&lt;?r&amp;lt;80. In addition, the use of such materials in handsets will ultimately 



110 

 

necessitate low cost raw materials and low processing costs as production volumes 

increases and profit margin reduces.  

 

As per author´s knowledge no work has been reported about the fabrication of thick 

composite film for functional electroceramics by electrophoretic deposition technique so, 

the attempt was made to fabricate functional electoceramic composite thick film of BNT-

BLT with EPD. However, this technique has been used to prepare nano composites, 

polymer-polymer composite and glass/polymer composites for other applications like 

mechanical, medical, inter alia [5-6]. 

 

By keeping this in view, attempts to fabricate composite thick films of BNT/BLT 

and BLT/BNT by EPD were undertaken in this work, to prove the concept that EPD is a 

viable, low cost and versatile technique to design and engineer thick composite films for 

miniaturised dielectric MW / High frequency applications. 

 

8.2 Experimental 

 

BLT-BNT composite films were fabricated in acetone based suspension with 

triethanolamine and the details of fabrication are given in Chapter 4.  

 

In BNT/BLT composite the first layer of BNT was carried out at 60V for 30 

second, followed by the layer of BLT carried out at 100V for 60 second. In a similar way 

BLT/BNT composite thick films were fabricated by carried out each layer of BNT and 

BLT at 60V for 30 second.  

 

The deposition behaviour for individual BNT and BLT films with time and 

constant voltage was depicted in Chapter 6, also illustrated in Figure 8-1 for convenience; 

the deposited thickness corresponds to the green film.

Results and Discussion 

8.3 Microstructure of BNT/BLT and BLT/BNT Composite Thick Films 

To examine the layered structure of BNT-BLT composite thick films cross sections 

were prepared. The preparation of cross section was a complicated task due to the flexible 



112 

 

nature of the used substrate and required precise chemical etching reagents for good grain 

boundary contrast. 

 

Figure 8-2(b) depicts the cross-section microstructure of BNT/BLT composite 

films with a total thickness of 30µm sintered at 1500ºC/6h. As clearly seen from the 

images composite film is quite dense and very homogeneous, with no abrupt interface 

between the two layers and the substrate, since no gaps are visible. Top view of the film 

shows the platelet like shape of BLT with very good densification (Figure 8-2(a)). EDS 

analysis was performed on the composite thick films to check the chemical homogeneity of 

the composite and the results are presented in Figure 8-3.  

 

According to the deposition parameters for BNT and BLT, the BNT layer deposited 

at 60V for 30 second should have the thickness of 17µm and the top layer of BLT 

deposited at 100V for 60 second should be near to 46 µm so, the total thickness of green 

composite film should be approximately 63µm. If one deduces around 16% of shrinkage 

during the sintering, then the film should be near 50 µm, but the total thickness obtained in 

BNT/BLT composite thick film is 30µm after sintered.  

 

In the previous studies, it was observed that the thickness does not increase linearly 

through out the deposition thickness because of the decrease in electric field with time. 

This could be the case for BNT/BLT composite thick film in which the second deposition 

should be performed for longer time and at high voltage, when compared with the 

deposition of individual layers.

Figure 8-4(b) depicts the cross-section microstructure of BLT/BNT composite 

films with a total thickness of 24µm sintered at 1500ºC/1h. The cross section image reflect 

that composite film is dense and very homogeneous, with no abrupt interface between the 

two layers and the substrate, since no gaps are visible. It is difficult to distinguish the BLT 

and BNT layer as no visual contrast can be seen between the layers. In the top view of the 

SEM image one can see the presence of BNT rod like grains with some amount of porosity 

(Figure 8-4 (a)) and EDS spectra (Figure 8-5) confirm the presence of all the elements of 

BLT and BNT excluding any possibility of secondary element in the composite thick film.

According to the deposition parameter depicted in Figure 8-1, the first layer of BLT 

should be 15µm thick, deposited at 60V for 30 second, followed by the second layer of 

BNT 17µm thick, carried out at 60V for 30 second. So, the predicted thickness for the 

green film according to the deposition parameter should be 32 µm and if one deduces the 

shrinkage by 16% one will get the value of thickness for sintered film of 26 µm which is 

quite close to what it was achieved for this BLT/BNT composite layer structure (24 µm).

 8.4 Electrical Properties of BNT/BLT and BLT/BNT Composite Thick Films 

  The measurements were performed at different points of the films and the 

represented results correspond to maximum and minimum values obtained in these films. 

Figure 8-6(a) depicts the relative permittivity and losses plotted as a function of the 

frequency and temperature for BNT/BLT composite films. The maximum relative 

permittivity obtained in the composite film was of ~72 and the minimum of ~60 with 

losses of about 0.002. The relative permittivity as a function of temperature is presented in 

Figure 8-6 (b). Relative permittivity does not vary much with the temperature and the TC?r 

of -16ppmºC for BNT/BLT composite films.

24?m thick BLT/BNT composite films presents a relative permittivity between 64 - 

59 with loss tangent of 0.009 (Figure-8-7). The TC?r of the material is +113ppm/ºC which 

is opposite in sign and quite higher when compared with the value obtained for BNT/BLT 

composites. In this case, no contrast was viewed in the cross-section although, top view of 

the BLT/BNT composite film shows the BNT rod like grains on the top of the composite 

film with higher amount of porosity which might be the reason of higher losses and lower 

permittivity as compare to BNT/BLT composite films.

8.5 Conclusion 

By applying a very simple technological approach that doesn’t rely on additional 

modifications or the use of additives and modifiers, it has been proved that layered 

composites thick films of BNT–BLT system can be fabricated by EPD. 

It was also observed that there are some limitations in this process when one needs 

to control the thickness of the composite film. In the process used in this work for the 

fabrication of composites, the first layer acts as an barrier for the second layer which 

affects the deposition of the second layer and the overall thickness of the composite film. 

Further studies on the composite deposition parameters are needed in order to optimise for 

example the thickness control. 

 

It is shown that the gap in terms of materials with 45&lt;?r&lt;80 can be filled with 

composite thick films of BNT-BLT fabricated by EPD. The properties obtained for these 

composite thick films are ?r ~60-70, TC?r ~-16ppm/ºC and loss tan(?) ~0.002 which are 

quite close to the composite ceramics reported before [1]. This constitutes an important 

result since together with the ability to decrease the size, contributing to the miniaturization 

of the device size, composite thick layered structures can be used to tailor the materials 

properties. 

 

To further improve the composite properties an optimum control on the deposition 

parameters or the use of intermediate drying and pressing steps or the use of additives and 

modifiers should be exploited. Moreover to assure low fabrication costs ways to reduce the

Chapter 9. Future Work 

 

This work was performed in a systematic way and it was proved that the 

Electrophoretic deposition technique is an adequate technique for the fabrication of BLT 

films and BLT-BNT composites thick films on metallic substrates. However it is still 

necessary to continue these studies in order to optimize some parameters related with the 

deposition of composite thick films and some scientific questions need to be answered as 

well. Below is a list, that does not intend to be exhaustive, but indicates some of the most 

relevant aspects that need further studies. 

 

1. Further studies are needed to optimise the deposition conditions for BNT-BLT and 

BLT – BNT composites, namely the exact control of the layer thickness, to increase 

the number of the multilayer’s, among others. 

 

2.  To make thick dielectric films of practical use, it is necessary to reduce the 

sintering temperature in order to be make these films compatible with low cost 

metallic or non metallic substrates; low sintering temperature attempts are then 

required, that may include the study of different sintering aids. 

 

3. The role of triethanolamine in the acetone based suspension needs to be exploited 

and clarified.  

 

4. The dependence of TC?r of BLT thick films on the film processing conditions and 

microstructure requires systematic studies of constrained sintering of thick films on 

metallic foils.
