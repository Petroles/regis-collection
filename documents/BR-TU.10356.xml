SUMMARY

Agricultural soils can act as a source or sink of atmospheric C, according to

the soil management.  This long-term experiment (22 years) was evaluated during

30 days in autumn, to quantify the effect of tillage systems (conventional tillage-

CT and no-till-NT) on the soil CO2-C flux in a Rhodic Hapludox in Rio Grande do Sul

State, Southern Brazil.  A closed-dynamic system (Flux Chamber 6400-09, Licor)

and a static system (alkali absorption) were used to measure soil CO2-C flux

immediately after soybean harvest.  Soil temperature and soil moisture were

measured simultaneously with CO2-C flux, by Licor-6400 soil temperature probe

and manual TDR, respectively.  During the entire month, a CO2-C emission of less

than 30 % of the C input through soybean crop residues was estimated.  In the

mean of a 30 day period, the CO2-C flux in NT soil was similar to CT, independent of

the chamber type used for measurements.  Differences in tillage systems with

dynamic chamber were verified only in short term (daily evaluation), where NT

had higher CO2-C flux than CT at the beginning of the evaluation period and lower

flux at the end.  The dynamic chamber was more efficient than the static chamber

in capturing variations in CO2-C flux as a function of abiotic factors.  In this chamber,

the soil temperature and the water-filled pore space (WFPS), in the NT soil,

explained 83 and 62 % of CO2-C flux, respectively.  The Q10 factor, which evaluates

CO2-C flux dependence on soil temperature, was estimated as 3.93, suggesting a

high sensitivity of the biological activity to changes in soil temperature during fall

season.  The CO2-C flux measured in a closed dynamic chamber was correlated

with the static alkali adsorption chamber only in the NT system, although the

values were underestimated in comparison to the other, particularly in the case of

high flux values.  At low soil temperature and WFPS conditions, soil tillage caused

a limited increase in soil CO2-C flux.

RESUMO:   EMISSÃO DE DIÓXIDO DE CARBONO EM LATOSSOLO
VERMELHO ALTERADA POR SISTEMAS DE PREPARO NO SUL
DO BRASIL

Os solos agrícolas podem atuar como dreno ou fonte de C atmosférico, dependendo do

sistema de manejo adotado.  Este estudo foi desenvolvido em experimento de longa duração

(22 anos), durante o período de 30 dias do outono, com o objetivo de avaliar o impacto de

sistemas de preparo de solo (preparo convencional-PC e plantio direto-PD) nas emissões de C-

CO2 de um Latossolo Vermelho distrófico, em Cruz Alta, RS.  As emissões de C-CO2 do solo

foram avaliadas com câmaras dinâmica (Flux Chamber 6400-09, Licor) e estática (com

captação em solução alcalina), imediatamente após a colheita da soja.  A temperatura e a

umidade do solo foram registradas, concomitantemente com as emissões de C-CO2, por meio

de sensor de temperatura e TDR manual, respectivamente, integrantes do Licor-6400.  Estimou-

se que, em 30 dias, uma quantidade equivalente a menos de 30 % do C aportado pelos resíduos

de soja foi emitida na forma de C-CO2.  As emissões de C-CO2 no solo em PD foram similares

às emissões do solo em PC, independentemente do tipo de câmara utilizada.  Diferenças entre

sistemas de preparo quanto à emissão de C-CO2, avaliadas com a câmara dinâmica, foram

verificadas somente a curto prazo (leituras diárias), com o PD apresentando maiores emissões

do que o PC no início do período experimental e menores no final.  A câmara dinâmica foi mais

eficiente do que a estática em captar as alterações das emissões de C-CO2 em função da

variação da temperatura e a porosidade preenchida por água (PPA) no solo em PD, as quais

explicaram 83 e 62 % das emissões de C-CO2, respectivamente.  O fator Q10, que avalia a

sensibilidade da emissão de C-CO2 à temperatura do solo, foi estimado em 3,93, indicando

alta sensibilidade da atividade microbiana à temperatura do solo durante o outono.  As

emissões de C-CO2 registradas no solo em PD com a câmara estática foram correlacionadas às

da câmara dinâmica, porém com valores subestimados em relação àquela notadamente nos

maiores valores de fluxo. Em condições de baixa temperatura e PPA, o preparo de solo induziu

limitado incremento de emissão de C-CO2.

Termos de indexação: plantio direto, gases de efeito estufa, temperatura do solo, umidade do

INTRODUCTION

Global warming, which is associated to the recent
increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, is a
result of a series of actions directly related to the
productive sector (IPCC, 2007).  Carbon dioxide is the
main greenhouse gas, being estimated that agriculture
sector could contribute up to 75 % of total Brazilian
emission (Embrapa, 2006).  Soil CO2-C flux is
increased by the land use change and biomass
burning, fossil fuel use, consumption of industrialized
products that demands high energy to manufacture,
and by tillage, that increases the biological activity
and soil C oxidation (Reicosky &amp;amp; Lindstrom, 1993).

Soil is an important natural C pool and it is
estimated that the amount of C stored in its first meter
is 1350 ± 250 Pg (1Pg = 109 Mg), therefore more than
twice the amount stored in the atmosphere (750 Pg)
(Sundquist, 1993).  Soil management practices
influence soil C flux to atmosphere and can define if
the soil will act as a source or a sink of atmospheric
C.  In the conventional tillage (CT), plowing followed
by harrowing, induces aggregate breakdown and
increases C turnover as a consequence of the exposure
of organic matter to microbes activity and their
enzymes (Six et al., 1998, 2006).  Soil aggregation
has been considered the main mechanism of C
protection of a wide range of soil classes (Six et al.,
2000; Bayer et al., 2000a; Denef et al., 2004; Dieckow



CARBON DIOXIDE EFFLUX IN A RHODIC HAPLUDOX AS AFFECTED BY TILLAGE SYSTEMS...           327

et al., 2005; Fabrizzi et al., 2008).  In addition, soil
tillage results in a higher contact between soil and
residues and increases soil temperature, both
processes that favor organic matter decay and increase
of soil CO2-C flux (Reicosky &amp;amp; Lindstrom, 1993; Bayer
et al., 2000a; La Scala et al., 2001; Lal, 2003).  On
the other hand, management systems associated to
minimum soil disturbances, such as no-tillage (NT),
when combined with high input of crop residues, favors
soil C storage (Mielniczuk, 1999; Amado et al., 2001;
Bayer et al., 2006).

The effect of tillage systems on soil CO2-C flux has
been intensively investigated, but the results found
about its impact are divergent.  Usually, short-term
CO2-C flux after tillage is higher in the CT plots
(Reicosky &amp;amp; Lindstrom, 1993; La Scala et al., 2006)
or in some cases similar (Sanhueza et al., 1994; Fortin
et al., 1996; Campos, 2006; Costa et al., 2008) to the
ones registered in the NT plots.  On the other hand,
some researchers found higher emissions in NT than
in CT systems (Hendrix et al., 1998; Ball et al., 1999),
which indicates that the effect of soil tillage on soil
CO2-C flux could be related to: duration, season, soil
moisture and temperature, soil type, the mechanism
of soil C stabilization and C stock (Liu et al., 2006).

This study aimed to investigate the effect of tillage
systems on soil CO2-C flux in the fall season,
determined by static and dynamic chambers, in a
Rhodic Hapludox in Cruz Alta, Rio Grande do Sul State,
Southern Brazil.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Climate, soil and location

The study was carried out in a long term
experiment (22 years), in Cruz Alta, Rio Grande do
Sul State (Brazil), at FUNDACEP station (28 o 36 ’ S;
53 o 40 ’ W; 409 m asl).  The soil was classified as clay
Rhodic Hapludox according to the soil taxonomy
(USDA, 1999) and “Latossolo Vermelho distrófico
típico” (LVd) by the Brazilian soil classification
(Embrapa, 2005), and is cited in this paper as Oxisol.
The soil analysis at the beginning of the experiment
(0–0.20 m layer) determined contents of: 570 g kg-1

clay, 120 g kg-1 silt, 310 g kg-1 sand, 32 g kg-1 soil
organic matter, pH (H2O) = 4.5, P = 19 mg dm

-3, K =
0.21 cmol c dm

-3, Al 3+ = 0.12 cmol c dm
-3 and

Ca2+ + Mg2+ = 0.42 cmolc dm
-3 (Campos, 2006).  The

Fe content determined by ditionite-citrate-bicarbonete
was 63.5 g kg-1; hematite was predominant over
goethite (Inda Jr.  et al., 2004).

The climate was classified as humid subtropical,
Cfa 2a, according to Köppen (Moreno, 1961).  Mean
annual precipitation is 1755 mm (from 1974-2006),
with uniformly distributed rainfall during the year
and mean air temperature of 18.7 °C (from 1998-2006),
minimum temperature of 8.6 °C in July and
maximum of 30 °C in January, according to data of a

meteorological station (FUNDACEP) near the
experimental area.  The experiment evaluated two
tillage systems (CT and NT) in the main plots (40 x
60 m) and three crop rotation systems in split plots
(40 x 20 m).  Measurements were performed in both
tillage systems, but only in the following crop rotation
system: black oat (Avena strigosa Schreber) /soybean
(Glycine max (L.) Merr.)/ black oat + common vetch
(Vicia sativa (L.) Walp.) /maize (Zea mays L.)/ radish
oil (Raphanus sativus L.  var.  oleiferus Metzg.)/ wheat
(Triticum aestivum L.)/ soybean.  The CT treatment
consisted of tilling in a plow operation with four disk
plow. The CT treatment consisted of soil tilling in a
plow operation with four disk plow. The plow tillage
was done at a depth of 0.20 m followed by a harrow
disk operation with 36 disks at 0.15 m. Soil
disturbance in the NT treatment was minimal; the
soil was only mobilized along the rows, while the
interrow soil surface was maintained under a cover
of crop residues.  In both tillage systems a planter
with double disk system was used (SEMEATO SHM
mid land 15/17).

CO2-C flux measurements

Soil CO2-C flux was evaluated after soybean
harvest by using static and dynamic chambers.
Soybean was harvested on April 18, 2007, and soil
CO2 flux measurements started on May 06, 2007
(static chamber) and May 08, 2007 (dynamic chamber)
and lasted for 30 days.

In the static chamber a CO2-capturing method was
applied in an alkaline solution for 24 h in a closed
chamber (Anderson, 1982), while the method in the
dynamic chamber was based on direct measurements
of CO2 concentration changes within a closed chamber
by using infrared absorption spectroscopy (Soil CO2
Flux Chamber 6400-09, Licor, NE, USA), during a
few minutes.

The static chamber consisted of a PVC cylinder
(diameter 0.3 m, height 0.3 m) that was inserted into
the soil to a depth of 0.05 m.  The top of the chamber
was covered with rubber aiming to seal it completely,
and a Zn cover over it fixed with four screws distributed
symmetrically on the circumference.  On the inside,
0.05 m above the soil, an x-format table was built to
support the plastic cup with alkaline 1 mol L-1 NaOH
solution to capture CO2-C emitted during the 24 h
period (Campos, 2006).  Four chambers were installed
in the soil three days before tillage, to determine
baseline values of emission.  In the CT plot, all
chambers were removed during soil tillage and replaced
immediately after.  The soil was tilled with a disk
plow on May 09, 2007, with a harrow on May 11,
2007, and winter sowing occurred on May 29, 2007.
The CO2 flux was registered on May 6, 9, 11, 14, 24,
29, and 30, 2007, totalizing 7 days of measurement
within 30 days.

The dynamic chamber consisted of a closed system
inserted over 0.10 m diameter PVC collars that were
displayed in soil at 0.01 m depth two days before the

beginning of CO2-C evaluation (Healy et al., 1996).
The chamber had an internal volume of 991 cm3, with
an exposed area to soil of 71.6 cm2, and was coupled
to a portable infrared gas analyzer (IRGA), which
determined the changes in CO2 concentration inside
the chamber by means of optical absorption
spectroscopy.  In this system, air passes continuously
from the chamber through the IRGA, and soil CO2 is
inferred based on the gas exchange rate within the
chamber (D’Andréa et al., 2006).  The exchange rate
based on CO2 concentration within the chamber was
calculated every 2.5 s, and the soil CO2 was computed
for approximately 90 s per measurement.  Ten PVC
collars were installed in each of the CT and NT plots.
The CO2 flux measurements started one day before disk
plowing, and were carried out on 15 measurement
days (May 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 21, 24, 28, 29,
and 30, and July 6, 2007).  On the measurement days,
soil CO2-C flux was determined at 9:00 and 15:00 h,
and a daily mean was calculated.  During tillage and
sowing, measurements were intensified, with 5 daily
replications after disk harrowing, 11 after harrowing
and 4 after sowing, to calculate the mean daily flux on
those days.  The soil CO2 flux results from both chambers
were expressed in C equivalent fluxes (CO2-C).

Soil temperature, soil moisture measurements
and meteorological data

Soil temperature and soil moisture were evaluated
at 0.10 m depth simultaneously to the CO2-C flux
measurements by a temperature sensor (thermistor)
and a TDR (time domain reflectometer) Campbell®

systems (Hydrosense TM, Campbell Scientific,
Australia), respectively.  As soil density was also
measured at all points it was possible to calculate the
WFPS.  Data of air temperature and rainfall during
the studied period were obtained from the
meteorological station FUNDACEP 50 m away from
the study site.

Statistical analysis

The effects of soil management systems on CO2-C
flux were investigated by descriptive data analysis.
The soil CO2-C flux relation with soil temperature
and WFPS was analyzed by the correlation coefficients
of exponential and linear relationships, respectively.
Soil CO2-C fluxes from static and dynamic chambers
were compared by linear regression adjustments and
standard mean error was used to compare the data.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Meteorological conditions during the studied
period

In terms of meteorological conditions at the study
site in May and June 2007, temperatures were colder
and rainfall higher than usually registered.  A total
rainfall of 179 mm was recorded in May (Figure 1a),

corresponding to a 24 % higher volume than the mean
monthly rainfall (136 mm).  Five rainfall events were
observed in the 30 day period when soil CO2-C flux
was measured, where 63 % of the total rainfall volume
of the period was recorded in only two events.  As
expected, higher WFPS values were found immediately
after the stronger rains (Figure 1a).  In general, the
values of WFPS in the NT soil were higher than in
the CT plot, which is in agreement with results
reported by Linn &amp;amp; Doran (1984), with exception of
May 28 (Figure 1a).  These results confirm the higher
capacity of NT system to infiltrate and hold soil
moisture in relation to CT.  Higher WFPS differences
(Figure 1a) between tillage systems occurred just after
the disk plow and harrow disk operations on the CT
plot.  It is noteworthy that around 85 % of the total
rainfall volume occurred after soil tillage.  Therefore,
after soil tillage, smaller WFPS values were found in
CT compared to NT.  This result is probably associated
to the wind effect that dried the bare soil surface of CT.

A mean air temperature of 14 °C was registered
during the studied period, which is 13 % below the
mean temperature registered for this month (16 °C).
Besides, a high thermal amplitude was verified, since
the air temperatures ranged from 4 to 22 °C, with a
declining trend throughout the experimental period.
In May, the soil temperature was similar in the two
tillage systems.  However, measurements performed
in the first week of June, after sowing, indicated a
higher soil temperature in the CT than the NT plot
(Figure 1b).

Soil CO2-C flux

Daily soil CO2-C flux measured with the dynamic
chamber in the NT plot ranged from 9 to 25 kg ha-1

day-1, while soil flux in the CT ranged from 5 to
20 kg ha-1 day-1 (Figure 2a).  Measurement results of
the static chamber indicated lower amplitudes than
the dynamic chamber, where results varied from 10
to 22 kg ha-1 day-1 in NT and from 11 to 18 kg ha-1

day-1 in CT soil (Figure 2b).

A mean daily CO2-C flux of 12.7 ± 2.2 kg ha
-1 day-1

was measured with the dynamic chamber under CT
and 15.7 ± 2.9 kg ha-1 day-1 under NT (Figure 2a).  A
19 % higher flux was observed in the NT than the CT
plot, although this result was not significantly different
(p &gt; 0.05).  A similar trend was registered for the static
chamber with a mean flux of 14.2 ± 1.0 kg ha-1 day-1 in
the CT plot, compared to the 13.4 ± 2.1 kg ha-1 day-1 in
NT soil (Figure 2b).  With this chamber, the CO2-C
flux in CT soil was 6 % higher than in NT, again
without significant difference (p &gt; 0.05).  The
similarity in the mean soil CO2-C flux registered in
tillage systems in a 30 day period agrees with results
of a long-term evaluation previously reported by
Campos (2006).  However, this author found a mean
CO2-C flux of 24.4 kg ha

-1 day-1 in CT and 26.0 kg ha-1 

day-1 in NT soil in a two-year period, which exceeds
the results found here by 42 and 48 %, in the CT and

R. Bras. Ci. Solo, 33:325-334, 2009

using static chambers, found a mean soil CO2-C flux
of 20 kg ha-1 day-1 during the growth period of alfalfa
(Medicago sativa L.).  This value is closer to the highest
CO2-C flux registered in May, and slightly lower than
the biannual flux reported by Campos (2006).

The mean separation procedure of the daily fluxes
revealed that differences in emissions induced by soil
tillage system have a complex nature, due to the daily
flux variability.  In the short term (single daily
readings), significant differences (p &amp;lt;0.05) between
soil tillage systems were verified in the CO2-C flux,
independent of the soil chamber, mainly in the first
weeks after tillage.  In the first two weeks of this
study, NT had a higher soil CO2-C flux than CT, when
evaluated by the dynamic chamber, which was more
efficient than the static to capture the temporal flux
variability.  This result is probably related to several
aspects: the presence of easily decomposable soybean
residues on the soil surface, higher WFPS values
(Figure 1a), higher stocks of labile soil organic carbon
(Campos, 2006) and higher microbial biomass in NT
compared to CT, as reported previously at the same
experimental site (Fabrizzi et al., 2008).  The higher
soil CO2 – C flux under NT compared to CT, especially
at sites under longstanding no-tillage systems, have
been reported elsewhere (Yamulki &amp;amp; Jarvis, 2002;
Campos, 2006; Liu et al., 2006; Oorts et al., 2007).
This could be related to an improvement in soil quality
and biomass input potential in the conservation
system, compared to conventional systems (Amado et
al., 2007).  In a 15-year-experiment, the soil CO2-C
flux in NT growing black oat+common vetch/
maize+cowpea was 64.7 kg ha-1 day-1, while in NT
with black oat/maize the flux was 51.6 kg ha-1 day-1

and in CT with black oat/maize 36.6 kg ha-1 day-1.
The soil CO2-C flux followed the order of soil quality
(Amado et al., 2007).  The soil quality kit test guide
(USDA, 1998) classifies a soil CO2-C flux of 35.8 to
71.7 kg ha-1 day-1 as ideal and a range of 17.9 to
35.8 kg ha-1 day-1 as medium.

NT plots, respectively.  The lower soil temperature
and absence of plant growth during the study period,
compared to the investigation of Campos (2006), could
explain the lower soil CO2-C flux.  Paul et al. (1999),

Soil tillage by disk plowing followed by disk
harrowing as well as the sowing procedure, both in
the CT plot, resulted in changes in soil CO2-C flux.
Fluxes registered by the dynamic chamber in the CT
plot had an irregular pattern with an increase of
around 40 % after the last tillage operation, compared
to the baseline CO2-C flux.  This increase in the flux
is at least partially associated to an exposure of
occluded particulate organic matter within the
aggregates (Six et al., 1998, 2006).  However, in our
experiment the increase in soil CO2-C flux induced by
tillage was much lower than reported by Reicosky &amp;amp;
Lindstrom (1993), in USA, in the first 24 h after
tillage.  In an Oxisol in Southern Brazil, La Scala et
al. (2006) also stated a higher CO2-C flux after tillage,
with CO2-C, values by up to 143 kg ha

-1 day-1 higher.
It should be emphasized that although the soils here
and in the study of La Scala et al. (2006) were similar,
the soil temperature in the two studies differed
markedly, so the lower soil temperature during and
after tillage operations in our study could partially
explain the lower flux.  In the CT soil the CO2-C flux
was lower than under NT, mainly in the rainy period
(just after tillage and shortly before sowing).  On the
other hand, the CO2-C flux in NT was more stable
during the rainy period (Figures 1a and 2a).  The
sowing procedure induced a significant increment of
44 % soil CO2-C flux in both tillage systems.  This
result is associated with the reduced spacing between
rows in winter crops (0.175 m), resulting in a
considerable soil disturbance.

The dynamic chamber was more efficient than the
static to capture short-term soil flux changes, e.g.,
those associated to the soil disturbances caused by
plow and disk operations (Figure 2).  In CT soil, one
day after plow tillage, the soil CO2-C flux decreased
by more than 40 % (Figure 2a).  Therefore, soil C-CO2
flux decreased from 13.6 to 5.1 kg ha-1 day-1, after a
soil temperature decline (from 15.9 to 12.5 °C)
(Figure 1b) and mainly the WFPS decrease (from 48
to 12 %) (Figure 1a).  In spite of an increase after
plowing, the soil CO2-C flux in CT was lower than in
NT (Figure 2a).  In this short-term study carried out
during the fall season the significant declines in soil
temperature and WFPS values probably affected the
soil biological activity and, consequently, CO2-C
production and diffusive transport to a greater extent
than the expected tillage impact on flux.

Fifteen days after the beginning of the experiment,
the soil flux in the NT plot dropped to a lower value
than measured in the CT plot (Figure 2a).  The higher
initial CO2-C flux in NT can be associated to the input
of soybean crop residues, 21 days before the experiment
began.  The higher initial CO2-C flux in the
conservation system could be explained by the low C/
N ratio of this residue, high labile C contents and the
more favorable WFPS verified in the NT than in the
CT plot (Figure 1a).  The decomposition of soybean
residues was fast, even when simply left on the soil
surface, as observed similarly by Campos (2006) at

the same site; the decay rate was more controlled by
moisture, temperature, pH and O2, and less by residue
incorporation into soil by tillage.  In addition, Aita &amp;amp;
Giacomini (2007) reported that the effect of tillage to
increase the crop residue decomposition rate is
inversely proportional to the N plant content.

In this study, the cumulative or total soil CO2-C
flux CO2-C flux, during a 30 day period, was similar
in the tillage systems, independent of the chamber
type (Figure 3).  Therefore, differences in CO2-flux
between treatments (Figure 2) were restricted to short-
term periods, while no difference between treatments
was stated in the 30 day period.

In the measurements of the dynamic chamber, the
total CO2-C flux in the NT plot was 471 kg ha

-1 but
381 kg ha-1 under CT (Figure 3).  These values are
equivalent to approximately 28 and 18 % of the
soybean crop residue input (NT=1698 kg ha-1 C and
CT = 2072 kg ha-1 C in the 2006/2007 growing
season), for NT and CT respectively.  Results of the
static chamber indicated that 24 and 21 % of
aboveground C input by soybean crops evolved as
CO2–C flux under NT and CT respectively. Based on
decomposition equations of soybean residues (NT y =
Co e-0.0085 t and CT y = Co e-0.0084 t) established by
Campos (2006) at this site, a CO2-C flux of 382 and
461 kg ha-1 from NT and CT soils, respectively, was
estimated in a 30 day-period.  Therefore, the source
of the greatest part of the CO2-C flux measured here
was probably the soybean residue decomposition.
Quincke et al. (2007) reported a cumulative or total
soil CO2-C flux of 327 kg ha

-1 from CT soil and
227 kg ha-1 in the NT soil in a soybean/sorghum
rotation in USA in a 30 day period after tillage,
measured in a dynamic chamber.  These results are
lower than the values found here.

Relationships between soil CO2-C flux and
soil temperature and WFPS

There was an exponential increase in soil CO2-C
flux with soil temperature (r = 0.91; p &amp;lt;0.0001), and

a linear relationship with soil WFPS (r = 0.79;
p &amp;lt;0.0004) (Figure 4).  These relations were
significant in the NT plot only and when measured
in the dynamic chamber, which was more sensitive
to changes of these variables than the static chamber.

Similarly as observed in this study, Janssens et
al. (2001) reported that 80 % of temporal changes in
soil CO2-C flux could be ascribed to changes in soil
temperature, at adequate soil moisture.  Verma et al.
(2005) and Costa et al. (2008) also observed a positive
correlation between soil CO2-C flux and soil
temperature.  However, in a bare Oxisol, La Scala et
al. (2000) found no correlation between CO2-C flux
and soil temperature.  During this experiment, the
NT plot maintained higher soil moisture with a mean
WFPS of 37 % (Figure 1a).  This is probably the
reason why soil temperature was detected as the main
control factor.  On the other hand, higher soil moisture
variation was registered in the CT plot, with a mean
WFPS of only 25 % (Figure 1a), that may have
influenced the relationship soil CO2-C - soil
temperature.  Linn &amp;amp; Doran (1984) observed a higher

aerobic microbial activity, measured by the soil CO2-
C flux, when the WFPS was close to 60 %.  The same
authors found the lowest soil CO2-C flux when WFPS
was around 30 %.

After the exponential model linearization, a model
Ln(E CO2-C ) = a + bTSOIL was obtained (Figure 4a).  In
this study Q10 was calculated by the following
mathematical expression: Q10 = e

10b, and the value
found was 3.93.  This result is in the range of 1.3 to
5.1 reported by Conant et al. (2004) in USA soils.
These authors found higher Q10 values when
temperatures were lower, in agreement with Lloyd &amp;amp;
Taylor (1994).

Comparison of soil CO2-C flux measured by
static and dynamic chambers

The correlation between CO2-C flux obtained from
the two chambers was linear in the NT plot (r = 0.78;
p &amp;lt;0.02) (Figure 5), while in the CT plot this
relationship was not significant.  Under NT, the static
chamber underestimated the CO2-C flux registered
by the dynamic chamber, especially when flux was
close or superior to 20 kg ha-1 day-1.  Jensen et al.
(1996) comparing static and dynamic chambers in CT
agriculture and under forest and pasture ecosystems
in temperate climate found an exponential
relationship (r= 0.84).  Therefore, when soil surface
CO2-C flux rates measured by the dynamic method
were above 24 kg ha-1 day-1 CO2-C, they were up to
five times higher than by the static method.
Therefore, these authors also reported that when CO2-
C fluxes are high, measurements by the static chamber
underestimate the ones by the dynamic chamber, as
verified in this study.

When the soil CO2-C flux is low the static chamber
can overestimate the flux in relation to the dynamic

chamber (Nay et al., 1994; D’Andréa et al., 2006).
Jensen et al. (1996) reported that some static chamber,
are not able to full integrate CO2–C flux in a one-day-
period.   Besides, the larger spatial variability observed
with the dynamic chamber requires a large number
of replications to obtain reliable estimates of the mean
soil CO2-C flux.  This limitation was probably reduced
in our study, at least during the tillage operation,
when 5 and 11 measurements were performed on the
days of disk plowing and harrowing, respectively, and
were reduced to a frequency of 2 daily measurements
(9–10 and 15–16 h) after that.  However, no
measurements were performed with the dynamic
chamber at night.

The dynamic compared to the static chamber is
more appropriate to detect spatial and temporal
variability in studies that relate soil CO2-C flux with
soil temperature and WFPS.  Using the dynamic
chamber it is possible to sample a high number of
points in a short time (La Scala et al., 2006).  This
fact probably helped to establish a significant
relationship between CO2-C flux and abiotic factors
(temperature and WFPS) by the dynamic but not the
static chamber.  On the other hand, the static chamber
maintained in the soil for 24 h has the advantage of
integrating the daily CO2-C flux and is probably more
adequate for long-term studies, for instance, related
to crop residue decomposition and labile C fraction
decay in soil organic matter.

CONCLUSIONS

1. The total soil CO2–C flux in a 30 day period
was similar in no-till and conventional tillage,
independent of the chamber type.  The differences in
CO2-C flux between tillage systems were related to
the day of observation; the differences were higher in
the first weeks after tillage.  The restricted impact of
soil tillage in CO 2-C flux was associated to
predominant climatic conditions of low soil
temperature and water-filled pore space during the
experimental period (autumn).

2. The dynamic chamber was more efficient than
the static to detect rapid changes in soil CO2-C flux
driven by abiotic factors.  Soil CO2-C flux in the no-
till plot increased exponentially with soil temperature
and linearly with water-filled pore space and these
properties explained most of the temporal flux
variability.  The CO2-C flux was more sensitive to
soil temperature than to water-filled pore space during
the fall period evaluated in southern Brazil.

3. Only in the no-till system the static chamber
CO2-C flux measurements were linearly related to
those of the dynamic chamber.  In this case of high
CO2-C flux the static chamber underestimated the
flux registered by the dynamic chamber.
