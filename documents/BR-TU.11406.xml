ABSTRACT 

Taffarello, D. (2016) Water security and ecosystem-based adaptation in the headwaters 

of Cantareira Water Supply System, Brazil. Doctoral Thesis, Sao Carlos School of 
Engineering, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Carlos. 

Water quantity, availability and, particularly, quality of Brazilian freshwater is under 
progessive degradation   due   to   Anthropocene’s   environmental changing conditions. Strategies 
of Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) are essential to mitigate these impacts. This Ph.D. 
thesis proposes a new model of water resources management, thereby integrating self-
purification and ecohydrologic processes to evaluate ecosystem services from watershed 
under change. In   Chapter 2, this thesis examinates the payment for hydrologic ecosystem 
services (Water-PES) in Brazilian Atlantic Forest and points ecohydrologic variables useful 
for assessing and further valuing hydrologic services. In Chapter 3, this thesis discusses 
proposals for freshwater monitoring plan which integrate quali-quantitative aspects for EbA 
and Water-PES projects. Therefore, in Chapter 4 experimental quali-quantative freshwater 
data from in-situ field observations are investigated according land-use/land-cover (LULC) in 
headwaters of water supply systems. In Chapter 5, through simulated impacts on freshwater 
yield from scenarios of LULC change, the grey water footprint (greyWF) is assessed, as well 
as environmental sustainability of sub-basins is depicted from a new ecohydrologic index for 
assessing hydrologic services. The methodology is performed using through field sampling 
and lab-analysing of physico-chemical, biologic and hydraulic variables in nested sub-basins 
draining to the Cantareira Water Supply System, in Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais states, Brazil. 
These areas participate in the Water-PES projects Water Producer/PCJ and Water 
Conservator at headwaters of Piracicaba watershed, during recent severe drought conditions 
between years 2013-15. The greyWF is estimated from outputs of time series simulated 
through ecohydrologic model Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Under assumption 
of continuity of Water-PES projects, and using the same series of hydrometorological records 
for a common period (2008-2014), freshwater quali-quantitative impacts are performed 
through   three   LULC   scenarios:   past   situation   “S1” (year   1990),   current   situation   “S2” (year 
2010) and future situation “S2+EbA” (year 2035). From these scenarios, flow and load 
duration curves, mean water yields, greyWF and seasonal variabilities, were simulated. 
Through this research, continuous-monitoring Data Collecting Stations were installed in 
public-private partnership encompassing EESC/USP, ANA, CPRM, CEMADEN, SMA, 
TNC, WWF and local mayors. This continuous monitoring is addressed to increase the 
system resilience, based on better decision-making for water security, in strategic headwaters 
not only for water supply, but also for environmental conservation. This doctoral thesis brings 
contributions to a better comprehension of anthropic impacts on water resources and for 
strategies of EbA in front of progressive rates of losses of ecosystem services. This PhD. 
thesis was part of three research initiatives which partly granted activities: (1) Thematic 
Project FAPESP 2008/58161-1  “Assessment of Impacts and Vulnerability to Climate Change 
in Brazil and Strategies for Adaptation Options; (2) “INCLINE   - INterdisciplinary CLimate 
INvEstigation   Center” (NapMC/USP – Núcleo de Apoio às Pesquisas em Mudanças 
Climáticas) and (3) “Água   Brasil” Project, Banco do Brasil Foundation, WWF Brazil, ANA 
&amp;amp; FIPAI/EESC-USP.

RESUMO 

 
Taffarello, D. (2016). Segurança hídrica e adaptação baseada em ecossistemas nas bacias 

de cabeceira do Sistema Cantareira, Brasil. Tese de Doutorado, Escola de Engenharia de 
São Carlos, Universidade de São Paulo, São Carlos. 

 
A quantidade, a disponibilidade e, em particular, a qualidade da água doce está em degradação 

progressiva devido às mudanças ambientais no Antropoceno. Estratégias de adaptação baseadas em 
ecossistemas (EbA) são essenciais para reduzir estes impactos. Propõe-se um novo modelo de 
gerenciamento de recursos hídricos que integre a pegada hídrica cinza e processos ecohidrológicos 
para avaliação dos serviços hidrológicos em bacias hidrográficas sob mudanças. As etapas da pesquisa 
são: Capítulo 2 - análise dos projetos de pagamentos por serviços ambientais de proteção às bacias 
hidrográficas na Mata Atlântica brasileira e, no contexto de EbA, indicação de variáveis 
ecohidrológicas úteis na quantificação e futura valoração dos serviços hidrológicos; Capítulo 3 – 
desenvolvimento de plano de monitoramento ecohidrológico que integra aspectos qualitativos e 
quantitativos dos recursos hídricos para projetos de EbA; Capítulo 4 – provisão de dados 
experimentais de qualidade e quantidade da água, além de observações in-situ, para investigação das 
influências das mudanças de uso e ocupação do solo nas cabeceiras de mananciais, estratégicos para o 
abastecimento público e a conservação ambiental; Capítulo 5 - estimativas da pegada hídrica cinza 
para nitrato, fósforo total e sedimentos a partir do monitoramento de variáveis quali-quantitativas em 
bacias com diferentes condições de uso e ocupação de solo. Foi realizada a instalação de três 
Plataformas de Coleta de Dados, por meio de parceria entre EESC, ANA, CPRM, CEMADEN, SMA, 
TNC e WWF, visando aumentar a resiliência do sistema, decorrente de futuro aprimoramento da 
gestão, para a segurança hídrica. A metodologia incluiu coletas em seis diferentes períodos, durante 
dois anos, e análises das variáveis condutividade elétrica, cor, DQO, DBO5,20, nitrato, nitrito, 
nitrogênio amoniacal, fosfato, pH, turbidez, sólidos totais, coliformes termotolerantes, Escherichia 
coli, medidas de vazões e velocidades médias em seções transversais. O método foi aplicado em 
microbacias participantes dos projetos Produtor de Água/PCJ e Conservador das Águas, dentre 
outras, com áreas de drenagem entre 7 e 1.000 km2, que contribuem para a bacia do rio Piracicaba 
(12.530 km2). Dados primários, medidos em recente período de severa estiagem no Sistema Cantareira 
(2013-14), foram integrados aos bancos de dados de órgãos gestores federais e estaduais. A produção 
de água foi maior em sub-bacias menos florestadas. Foi possível aprimorar a regionalização de cargas 
poluidoras por área de drenagem na região do Cantareira. A pegada hídrica cinza (WF) foi estimada a 
partir de simulações no modelo ecohidrológico Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Curvas de 
permanência de vazões e carga poluidora por área de drenagem foram elaboradas. Supondo-se a 
continuidade dos projetos “Produtor  de  Água/PCJ”  e  “Conservador  das  Águas”, foram investigados os 
impactos de cenário futuro de uso do solo. Finalmente, foi desenvolvido novo índice ecohidrológico 
para quantificação dos serviços hidrológicos e avaliação a sustentabilidade das sub-bacias, a partir da 
pegada hídrica cinza composta. Assim, usando ferramentas de vanguarda tecnológica (SWAT e WF), 
a tese fornece subsídios para uma melhor compreensão dos impactos antropogênicos sobre os recursos 
hídricos e novas estratégias de adaptação baseada em ecossistemas, frente às progressivas taxas de 
perda de serviços ambientais. Esta tese esteve vinculada a três projetos de pesquisa, dos quais obteve 
apoio financeiro: (1) Projeto Temático FAPESP 2008/58161-1   “Assessment of Impacts and 
Vulnerability to Climate Change in Brazil &amp;amp; Strategies  for  Adaptation  Options”; (2) “INCLINE  - 
INterdisciplinary   CLimate   INvEstigation   Center” (NapMC/USP) e (3) Projeto “Água   Brasil”,  
Fundação Banco do Brasil, WWF Brasil, ANA e FIPAI/EESC-USP.

CHAPTER  1 

GENERAL INTRODUCTION 

1.1. Research Context 

Life depends on water. Before humans have learnt how to write, they have been 

hunters and food gatherers. Agricultural revolution becomes possible to live in permanent 

villages. Thus, early state civilizations have been developed along the rivers. They built 

hydraulic structures, such as cisterns, dams, dikes and aqueducts in Tigris-Euphrates, Nile and 

Indus valleys around 4,000 b.C., i.e., from the late Holocene. In Latin America, the Mayas 

and Incas also developed ancient water systems. These advances in water supplies and 

distribution were interrupted around the fall of the Roman Empire. 

Urban civilizations have replaced those small villages by cities. Agriculture has 

progressively replaced the forests. As populations have growth, concerns have arisen in 

dealing with the multiple uses of water resources, i.e., irrigation, flood protection and 

wastewater drainage. On the one hand, the hydraulic innovations were needed for human 

supply. On the other hand, these technologies and deforestation become ecosystems even 

more vulnerable as a result of anthropogenic impacts. 

Since the mid-XXt h century, the rapid human population growth, sophisticated 

technological development and increased consumption of resources have accelerated the 

water pollution and scarcity. FAO (2016) estimates that there will be need an increase in 60% 

of global food production to feed more than nine billion people forecasted to live on planet by 

2050. This persistent human impact on Earth seems reflect on a new epoch in the geological 

time scale: the so called Anthropocene (Crutzen, 2002). Waters et al. (2016) summarized the 

key markers of anthropogenic changes which are indicative of the Anthropocene. For 

example, the biotic change, which encompass species invasions and accelerating extinction. 

Furthermore, human-induced stressors are reshaping marine, freshwater and terrestrial 

ecosystems in unprecedented ways (Magurran, 2016). 

The water cycle connects the abiotic environment (lito- and atmosphere) with the bio- 

and anthropospheres, thereby leading the distribution of life on Earth (Ehret et al., 2014). In 

turn, freshwater ecosystems have been recognized as among the most threatened ecosystems 



2 
 

in the world since 20 years ago (Postel; Daily &amp;amp; Ehrlich, 1996, Brauman et al., 2007; Dodds 

et al., 2013; Brauman 2015). Estimates point that at least 10,000–20,000 freshwater species 

are extinct or at risk, with loss rates comparable to those of previous succession Pleistocene-

Holocene. It has been showed that 65% of   Earth’s river discharge and habitats associated are 

moderately to highly threatened (Vörösmarty et al., 2010). 

In his pioneering work, A.G. Tansley (1935) proposed   the   term   “ecosystem”,  

encompassing abiotic and biotic factors, as well as their functional and structural 

relationships. Moreover, terrestrial ecosystems influence freshwater by moving and modifying 

flows in ecohydrologic processes. The relationships among ecohydrologic processes are 

strongly non-linear (see Rodriguez-Iturbe, 2000; Zalewski&amp;amp;Robartz, 2003; Olden., Kennard 

&amp;amp; Pusey, 2012; Jørgensen, 2016; also called geo-bio-hydrologic processes by Kobiyama; 

Genz &amp;amp; Mendiondo, 1998). This ecohydrologic processes in both aquatic and terrestrial 

ecosystems provide benefits for humans, i.e. ecosystem services (Daily, 1997; MEA, 2005). 

This term was first used in literature by the couple Erlich (Erlich &amp;amp; Erlich, 1981), both 

biologists from Stanford University. 

In water resources, three classes of ecosystem services, provisioning, regulating and 

supporting and their links, are of relevance. Provisioning services involve the production of 

renewable resources (for example, freshwater). Regulating services are those that indicate 

benefits arising from regulation of ecological processes and hence lessen environmental 

change (for example, climate regulation, water purification, disease control, attenuation of 

hydrologic extremes like floods and droughts; Cardinale et al., 2012). Supporting services are 

cycles of transformation of energy and mass at ecosystems and they are the basis for 

providing other ecosystem services (such as water and nutrients cycles, soil development; 

MEA, 2005). All types of ecosystem services have been progressively damaged by 

anthropogenic pressures. Despite the increasing number of studies on ecosystems services in 

last years, interactions among land-use management, ecohydrologic processes and ecosystem 

services delivery are still not fully understood (De Groot et al., 2010). 

Land-use/land-cover (LULC) changes are the main threats which induce unbalanced 

water flows, biodiversity losses and interruption of nitrogen, phosphorous and other 

biogeochemical cycles, depleting ecosystem services in large scales (Daily et al., 1997). 

Ecosystem services generated in consequence of water and soil conservation within  the scale 

of watershed, catchments or river basins are defined as hydrologic services, i.e., when we 

consider the human well-being as a result of the multiple uses of water resources (Brauman, 

2015; Dodds et al., 2013; Brauman et al., 2007). There are diverse links between hydrologic 



3 
 

 
 

services and ecohydrologic processes (Figure 1.1). According to Vörösmarty, Pahl-Wostl &amp;amp; 

Bhaduri (2013), “Humans  are  changing  the  global  water  system  in  a  globally-significant way 

without   adequate   knowledge   of   the   system   and   thus   its   response   to   change.” Thus, the 

hydrologic ecosystem services concept can be related to their capacity to help solving water 

problems, to identify and mitigate trade offs between management options. 

In face of these significant changes, we need to understand how the ecohydrologic 

processes work, if we want to develop better policies on watershed management (Ricklefs, 

2015). For building this knowledge, we need to understand the complex and dynamic 

interactions throughout diversities of phenomena in different scales, since catchments are 

complex dynamical systems. First, it is needed to study the continental hydrologic cycle and 

the linked energy and mass transfers into the ecosystems. In this cycle, the water flows can be 

divided into two: blue water (superficial and groundwater runoff) and green water 

(evapotranspiration and subsuperficial runoff) (Figure 1.1), in a way to become easier the 
water resources management into a catchment. Second, the geobiochemical cycles are also 

important at the catchment scale. Thus, the potential provisioning of hydrologic services 

depends on the water balance, e.g. the relationships between water availability and water 

demand, both from natural variabilities and human-driven activities. 

Regarding policies on water resources, the basin plan comprises the primary 

management tool for sustainable use of water resources in both spatial and temporal scales. 

However, to date, adaptive management alternatives have seldom been incorporated in the 

Brazilian basin plans, such as Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA). Neither integrated quali-

quantitative analysis, nor combined indicators of human-ecosystem appropriation of 

freshwater resources have been established in basin plans. Among these quantitative 

indicators, I should highlight the water footprint - WF (Mekonnen &amp;amp; Hoekstra, 2015; 

Hoekstra et al., 2011; Hoekstra, 2003), because it encompasses grey, blue and green portions 

of water into a unique indicator for evaluating the sustainability arising from water resources 

pollution and consumption. For sustainable water allocation planning, the river plans must be 

elaborated based on accurate data on actual water availability per basin, taking into account: 

(i)   water   needs   for   humans;?   (ii)   environmental   water   requirements   and   (iii)   the   basin’s   ability  

to assimilate pollution (Mekonnen et al., 2015).

            Some countries have used the WF concept as an auxiliary tool for better water 

resources planning and management. For example, Spain enacted a regulation to use the water 

footprintin watershed plans (Velázquez et al., 2011; Aldaya et al., 2010). In Brazil, the 

watershed plans estimate the water demand by surface water and groundwater abstractions. 

However, a recent rule from the Brazilian National Water Agency recommends the inclusion 

of the WF indicator among other indicators to characterize the technical reports (ANA, 2015).  

According to Hoekstra et al. (2011), WF   measures   both   the   direct   and   indirect   “water  

use”   within   a   river   basin.   The   term   “water   use”   includes   water withdrawal: the consumptive 

use of rainwater (the green water footprint) and of surface/groundwater (the blue water 

footprint), and water pollution, i.e., the volume of water used to assimilate the pollutant loads 

(the grey water footprint, greyWF). The water footprint standards encompass four phases: (1) 

Setting goals, (2) Accounting, (3) Sustainability assessment, and (4) Response formulation. 

WF studies can be restricted to one specific activity of these phases or be related to more than 

one phase. In this research, I address phases 2, 3 and 4 of an overall investigation of WF 

proposed by Hoekstra et al. (2011). 

 

1.2. Research Motivation 

As a Biologist, I have worked on water resources management at Sao Paulo 

Environmental Secretariat in 2008-2014. I was introduced to the Water Footprint after the 5t h. 

World Water Forum, Turkey, 2009. The WF appeared as an indicator of (regulating) 

ecosystem services with potential application in Sao Paulo watersheds, especially in the scope 

of Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) projects. In 2011, I co-organized a Workshop on 

PES with 500 participants and a reference book on PES (Pagiola; von Glehn &amp;amp; Taffarello, 

2013). Among the pioneering Brazilian PES initiatives, I highlight   the   “Water Producer/PCJ” 

project and its possible nexus with WF. Throughout this context, I gave speeches outside 

Brazil in Mexico (Taffarello &amp;amp; Mendiondo, 2011; Taffarello et al., 2011) and in Dominican 

Republic (Aligning Water Fund Investment Prioritization in Latin America Workshop). Also, 

I have completed the 1º Water Footprint Training Course in Brazil 

(TNC/WWF/USP/Univ.Twente), when I have met Prof. A. Hoekstra and Prof. E. M. 

Mendiondo, who used to work on ecohydrology (Mendiondo, 2008). Prof. Mendiondo and I 

have noticed that a conceptual rationale was lacking to link PES, ecohydrologic processes and 

WF at changing watersheds. 



6 
 

 
  
I was intrigued because even with the evolution of those projects, some water related 

questions have persisted, such as: 1) How would hydrological monitoring be for PES 

projects? 2) What conditions and criteria about their linebases or benchmark for comparing 

PES schemes? 3) How to build partnerships among stakeholders responsible for these 

monitoring in long term, since decades are needed to notice water quality variations from 

possible PES results at the catchment scale? 4) What kind of ecohydrologic issues are needed 

to promote proper valuation of PES projects at the catchment scale?  

To address these knowledge gaps, the current research was carried out using 

complementary inductive and deductive methods (Pathirage et al., 2008), encompassing 

experimental investigations and ecohydrologic modelling. Using as case study strategic 

headwaters of South-East Brazil, this Ph.D. research purposes a new conceptual model for 

water resources management, integrating ecohydrologic aspects and the greyWF for hydro-

services assessment at different catchments scales. Besides the geographical and socio-

economic relevance of the study area, climate change and poor water resources management 

added temporal relevance. Sao Paulo almost experienced a collapse on water supply during 

the years of this research (Nobre et al., 2016; Escobar, 2015; Manca, Falconi, Zuffo &amp;amp; Dalfré 

Filho, 2014). 

 

1.3. Hypothesis 

The current research assumptions are, mainly, related to hydrologic services as 

regulating ecosystem services, as proposed by Brauman (2015). In this context, identifying 

the hydrologic services of interest can help define which ecohydrologic processes to monitor 

for improve water resources management. For this reason, Ecosytem-based Adaptation (EbA) 

is here addressed with selected variables. Among the ecohydrologic variables, I highlight the 

grey water footprint (greyWF) as a robust and relatively straight forward for dealing with 

nutrient loads upstream to downstream at different scales of watersheds. Thus, based on 

Zhang et al. (2010), the greyWF can reveal the hydrologic regulating services throughout the 

use of rivers capability of autodepuration. From this background, the assumptions of this 

doctoral thesis are: 

? First, the interactions between the hydrological cycle and the sustainability of the 

ecosystems can be linked to ecohydrologic processes and variables. Identifying 

specific ecohydrologic processes can be an adequated method for verifying the 

delivery of hydrological services in spatial and temporal scales in which the targeted 



7 
 

 
 

service is generated. Especially, because the use of this method is still not explicitly 

incorporated into Brazilian mechanisms of Payment for Environmental Services (PES) 

for watershed protection. 

 

? Second, because riparian forests contribute with autodepuration in streams and rivers, 

I expect to find better relationships between river water quality and forested land use 

types, which can be shown by lower greyWF for nutrients, such as nitrate and total 

phosphorous; 

 

? Third, the correlation between greyWF for nutrients and water yield from catchment 

runoff I here postulate as a new indicator for assessment of hydrologic services. 

Therefore, studying this relationship through comparing scenarios with and without 

EbA allow us maintaining the ecosystem services of the river-catchment system for 

the long term. 

 

1.4. Objectives 

The main objective of this thesis is to create a multidisciplinary and new framework 

which integrates ecohydrologic aspects and the grey water footprint for the assessment of 

ecosystem services for protection of changing watersheds. This assignment, applied into the 

drainage watersheds of the Cantareira Water Supply System can contribute for the 

improvement of the water resources management in the context of catchments revitalization. I 

used literature review, planned a freshwater monitoring and field investigations through quali-

quantitative freshwater sampling, integrated into three scenarios performed by an 

ecohydrologic model to investigate an inter-related range of specific objectives (Figure 1.2): 
 

(i) In the context of Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA), evaluate the payment for 

hydrologic ecosystem services in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and elucidate ecohydrologic 

variables useful for hydrologic services assessments and further valuation;  

 

(ii) Develop a hydrologic monitoring plan for Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) 

projects;  

 



8 
 

 
  
 (iii) Provide new experimental data sets, integrating water quality and quantity 

samples from in-situ field observations, to study the role of land-use/land-cover (LULC) 

change at headwaters of water supply systems; 

 

(iv) Assess the hydrologic services based on grey water footprint sustainability in 

catchments under LULC change, encompassing best management practices as EbA option.

1.5. Thesis Structure 

A methodological framework for this research and links between chapters is displayed 

in Figure 1.2. I organized this thesis into four chapters, modified versions of manuscripts, 

which address a set of my progressive knowledge on ecohydrologic processes and their 

interactions with ecosystem functioning and human needs. This is essential for a proper 

hydrologic services evaluation at catchment scale.  

The thesis is structured as follows: after this introduction (Chapter 1), I begin with 
some ecohidrologic general definitions and an overview of water-related PES projects (Water 

– PES) in Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Then, I build a conceptual framework from ecohydrologic 

variables for integrated water resources management and provide some insights on how 

Water-PES may contribute as an Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) option to face the 

changing conditions of catchments in the Atlantic Forest biome (Chapter 2). 
The next step is to envision a viable freshwater monitoring plan, which integrates 

quantitative and qualitative aspects of water resources, for the selected study catchments: the 

micro catchments eligible to participate in the Water Producer/PCJ project (Chapter 3): 

Cancã (58 km2) and Moinho (17 km2). By planning and discussing conditions for efficiency 

in its implementation, this third chapter represents a conceptual link for the next. 
Then, I present results from a multi-site, nested catchment experiment, carried out 

during a dry period (September 2013 – May 2014) within the Cantareira Water Supply 

System (hereafter referred as the Cantareira System), linking quali-quantitative freshwater 

monitoring to land-use/land-cover change evaluated by satellite images (Chapter 4). A quali-

quantitative analysis of 17 catchments shows regional variabilities and trends for nitrate loads 

versus drainage areas (0.66 to 925 km2). The field experimental method is resultant from the 

baseline of a monitoring that can allow the evaluation of maintenance of ecohydrologic health 

of streams in long term. In brief, the primary data brought by these field investigations outline 

a scale sensitive behavior, offering a useful tool for proactive management. Besides, these 

field data were used to calibrate the ecohydrologic model and compare the model 

performance regarding discharge and loads in the next chapter.  

Although hydrological models provide hypothesis testing of complex dynamics 

occurring at river basin scales, freshwater quality modeling is still incipient at many Brazilian 

river catchments. In Chapter 5, I compare freshwater quality scenarios under different 

LULC, one of them related to Ecosystem-based Adaptation option. Using the spatially semi-

distributed SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model, nitrate and total phosphorous

loads were modeled across Brazilian subtropical catchments with drainage areas ranging from 

7.2 to 1037 km2. Part of these catchments are eligible areas of the Brazilian PES-programs 

Water Producer and Water Conservator in the Cantareira System, which until the drought in 

2013-14 supplied water to 9 million people in the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Region. On the one 

hand, simulations of nitrate and total phosphorous allowed the regionalization of grey water 

footprint (greyWF) at different spatial scales under LULC change. On the other hand, 

conservation practices simulated envisage not only viable best management practices, but also 

preventive decision making at the headwaters of water supply systems.   

In Chapter 6, I summarize and conclude my doctoral thesis with a discussion of how 

the ecohydrologic processes are crucial for a comprehensive hydrologic services evaluation. 

According to Cunha &amp;amp; Calijuri (2012), we should make the best or most effective use of 

natural resources, minimizing the impacts and look for the best solutions. In this context, 

when the reduction of the greyWF is not possible, I purpose the compensating of the greyWF 

through implementation of EbA strategies. This can be a techno-scientific viable solution, 

economically advantage (because   the   “water   provider” receive financial incentives for 

maintenance of health forests and freshwater ecosystems) and politically feasible, in 

accordance with a river basin focus on the integrated water resources management for the 

sustainable development. 

Thus, the chapters of this thesis are timely and relevant on water security, with a 

specific focus on water quality. Here, I would like to acknowledge the inspiring cooperation 

of my co-authors, which makes my work possible. All four chapters are published or under 

review in peer-reviewed international journals: Science of the Total Environment (Chapter 2), 

Journal of Environmental Protection (Chapter 3), Water International (Chapter 4) and Water 

Resources Research (Chapter 5). Besides four international articles/manuscripts which are the 

chapters of this doctoral thesis, some of other outcomes are listed in Appendix A.

Abstract 

Payment for ecosystem services (PES) 1 is being widely proposed as a strategy for water 

resources conservation. Similarly, Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) has been globally 

encouraged as an option to climate and land-use change. Our objective was to review 

information on Water-PES initiatives in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a hotspot for 

biodiversity conservation where several water-PES projects have been stablished. We found 

16 ongoing Water-PES in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. The first initiative was launched in 

2005, and since then water-PES projects have rapidly grown. In spite of the success of many 

of these initiatives and their real advances, they seldom have hydrological baseline data and 

an implemented strategy for ecohydrological monitoring. Thus, we discuss how Water-PES 

projects could be more effective by implementing hydrological monitoring based on 

ecohydrology concepts, and how an integrated hydrological services valuation in water-PES 

projects would contribute as Ecosystem-based Adaptation options to climate and land-use 

changes.

Highlights 

x Since 2005, many water-PES initiatives have been launched in the Brazilian 
Atlantic Forest.  

 

x Water-PES schemes lack for hydrologic monitoring and options to cope with 
challenges under change. 

 

x Hydrologic ecosystem services assessments are not integrated in the Water-PES 
schemes.  

 

x An ecohydrologic framework for ecosystem services assessments is proposed. 
 

x This framework is a tool for integrated water resources management and 
ecosystem-based adaptation. 

 

 

2.1. Introduction 

The Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) through incentive strategies to conserve 

(Buckley &amp;amp;Pegas, 2014; Joly et al., 2014) or to restore (Banks-Leite et al., 2014; Palmer &amp;amp; 

Filoso, 2009) ecosystems represents possible solutions to prevent the degradation of water 

resources and related ecosystem services. This procedure can be instrumental not only to 

reduce the risks of inadequate land use, but also to manage and adapt to climate change and 

megadroughts (Underwood, 2015; Seppelt et al., 2011). In Latin America, particularly in 

Brazil, climate change adaptation options have been widely encouraged (Escobar, 2015; 

Marengo et al., 2015; Phillips et al., 2009). 

The outcome of RIO + 20 provided a view that if development is to be truly 

sustainable; we need to value nature (Munang et al., 2013; Thiaw &amp;amp; Munang, 2012). This 

goal is based on the context of new scientific and policy awareness about climate change over 

the past 20 years (Tanner et al., 2015). Also, the concept of ecosystem-based adaptation 

(EbA),   as   ‘the use of biodiversity and ES to help people adapt to the adverse effects of climate 

change’,   was   defined   by   the   Convention   on   Biological   Diversity   10t h Conference of the 

Parties (CoP) (CBD, 2010). According to EbA, protecting environmental services is required 

to help people and ecosystems to reduce their vulnerability and increase their resilience to 

climate change impacts (Marengo et al., 2014).  



16 
 

 
  

Scientists worldwide look for quantification and integrated methods to measure the 

value of hydrological ES (Brauman, 2015, Brauman et al., 2007, Broadbent et al., 2015, Duku 

et al., 2015, Naeem et al., 2015) to enable the effectiveness of PES initiatives. A pioneer 

technique, based on a benefits transfer approach, found that the economic value of 17 ES for 

16 biomes averaged US$ 33 trillion per year and was 1.8 times higher than the global gross 

national product of 1995 (Constanza et al., 1997). This value was recently updated to a range 

between US$ 125 and US$ 145 trillion/year (Costanza et al., 2014).  

Another study assessed the global human impact on the potential value of six freshwater 

ecosystem services (water quality, water availability, greenhouse gases, biodiversity, 

commodities and disturbance regulation) based on composite indexes (Dodds et al., 2013).  

Ecohydrology is the interaction between biota and hydrology (Zalewski &amp;amp; Robarts, 

2003), and the incorporation of its concepts can help to fill the gap between environmental 

scientists and engineers for achieving sustainable and integrated water resources management 

(Zalewski, 2014, 2015). Ecohydrology therefore provides the tools to address the current 

environmental challenges, such as the imbalance between water demand and available water 

resources. This subject has become more visible internationally with the Agenda Post-2015 

for sustainable development (UN-Water, 2014) and in Brazil with the expected discussions in 

the next 8th World Water Forum, which will be held in Brasília, Brazil, in 2018. 

Despite the advances and increasing number of PES studies, some questions remain 

(Naeem et al., 2015; Pagiola et al., 2013), such as: how can the efficiency of the Water-PES 

projects, built through partnership between governments and stakeholders, be evaluated in the 

context of watershed under change? In what manner could the private companies or 

government provide better incentives for the participation of new stakeholders, e.g. water 

users and river basin committees, into PES markets? What methodological strategies of 

ecohydrology can be used to achieve faster advances in PES schemes under comparative EbA 

frameworks? And, what are the lessons learned from ongoing Brazilian Water-PES projects in 

the context of risk-based or EbA assessments?  

This study aims to address PES in the Atlantic Forest, Brazil, as a climate change 

adaptation option. First, we systemize information about PES projects implemented in the 

Brazil’s Atlantic Forest. Then, we present the development of ecohydrology and EbA 

concepts, and discuss how Water-PES projects can become more effective and reduce the 

vulnerability to climate change impacts, in an example of EbA option.

2.2. Water-PES projects in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest 

We compile information about PES in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest using previous 

information provided by Guedes &amp;amp; Seehusen (2011), only considering actual PES cases, and 

Pagiola et al. (2013). Then, we expanded and detailed the list of PES initiatives by consulting 

specific published documents. We prioritized peer-reviewed articles but also considered 

publications in grey literature, thesis and dissertations, and the professional experience of the 

author in the projects. In addition, a questionnaire was sent to PES project managers to obtain 

supplementary information. 

It was possible to acquire information on more than 60 Brazilian PES projects, 

classified in four types of ES: (a) protection of river basins (Water-PES); (b) carbon sink; (c) 

biodiversity protection; and (d) scenic beauty protection. From this sample, we selected only 

on the ground Water-PES and found 16 initiatives in Brazil’s Atlantic Forests, created since 

the last decade (Table 2.1). Although we selected only the implemented projects, there are 

twice as many water-PES initiatives in articulation or development in different Brazilian 

states.  

The first Atlantic Forest (and Brazilian) PES scheme, the “Projeto Conservador das 

Águas” at Extrema-MG, started in 2005 (Richards et al., 2015). Since then, Water-PES 

initiatives have rapidly expanded in the Atlantic Forest, and, on average, 1.5 new Water-PES 

projects have been initiated per year. The Atlantic Forest occurs in 17 Brazilian states, but we 

found Water-PES projects only in six states of South and South-East Brazil (Fig. 2.1), 

indicating Water-PES projects are not equally distributed through this vast and populous 

biome. Sao Paulo state, which is the most populous and richest (highest gross national 

product) state in Brazil, concentrated 40% of the implemented water-PES initiatives in the 

Brazilian Atlantic Forest.  

Despite Water-PES projects in the Atlantic Forest vary on their area of abrangency and 

number of beneficiaries, only three of 16 initiatives (“Mina D’Água”, “Bolsa Verde” and 

“Programa Reflorestar”) are state programs occurring at a regional scale (Table 1). Most of 

the initiatives occur at local scale, in important catchments for urban water supply. For 

example, “Conservador das Águas” and “Produtor de Água/PCJ” are within the Cantareira 

Water Supply System, while “Oásis São Paulo” are around Guarapiranga and Billings 

reservoirs, in both cases, systems that supply water for the 20 million people of São Paulo 

metropolitan area.

All the on the ground Water-PES projects found in the Atlantic Forest pay for rural 

landowners, often through legal agreements (PES contracts varying in years of duration), 

which is not always the case for other Latin America countries (Bremer et al., 2016). 

Moreover, most of them (12) have already established legal instruments to secure the project 

and the flux of resources through time. Finally, all the initiatives have the conservation of 

forest remnants an eligible action for PES while forest restoration, soil conservation, organic 

agriculture and adoption of rural sanitary measures (for example, installation of septic tanks 

or sewage treatment) are considered for some of them.  

Forest restoration, when considered as an eligible action, is focused on riparian areas 

called APP or “Permanent Protection Areas” according to the Brazilian forest law (Soares-

Filho et al., 2014). Restoration of degraded APP is mandatory for landowners. Thus, our 

results show that Water-PES initiatives at Atlantic Forest often pay for actions in legally 

protected areas. Furthermore, most of the Water-PES initiatives provide other benefits to 

participants beyond the PES, paying part or integrally the costs for land management actions 

that generate the PES (Table 2.1). Thus, some Water-PES projects constitute an opportunity 
to landowner to receive PES as well as to comply with Brazilian forest law, with no costs.  

We found public (federal, state, and municipal initiatives), private (companies and 

foundations) and non-profit organizations working with PES for the protection of watersheds 

(Table 2.1). Arrangements are diverse and involve multiple stakeholders, mixing public, 

private and non-governmental organizations, corroborating the idea that, for PES, one size 

does not fit all (Bremer et al., 2016). Having the local government leading the PES project is 

the most common situation in the Atlantic Forest. One rare case is the Oasis Project at São 

Paulo, where the leading institution is a private foundation (Tabela 2.1). Interesting cases 
arise from “Produtor de Água/PCJ”, “Produtores de Água e Floresta” and “Conservador das 

Águas”, located in watersheds that charge water users (Tabela 2.1). In these initiatives, PES 
for landowners is made integrally or partly, directly by the River Basin Committee, using the 

resources obtained through charging for water use. This scheme fits the polluter-payer and 

provider-recipient concepts (Taffarello et al., 2016b, Viani &amp;amp; Bracale, 2015). Other frequent 

and similar arrangement is the direct involvement of water supply and sanitation institutions. 

In some initiatives, as the “Camboriu River” and “Oásis-Apucarana” the legal arrangements 

were already established to guarantee part of the revenue of these companies for the project 

(Table 2.1).  



23 
 

 
 

Finally, six projects are linked to the “Water Producer” program, a concept that was 

introduced in the country by the National Water Agency, with the objective of supporting 

Water-PES projects that focus on improving water quality, increasing water supply and flow 

regulation (ANA, 2012). In spite of being all linked to the Water Producer Program, each of 

these six initiatives has your own local functioning, diverging with regard to scale of action, 

institutional arrangement, and amount of resources invested for implementation and 

maintenance of the project (Table 2.2).  

Besides the 16 Water-PES projects summarized in Table 2.1, we highlight more two 
Water-PES programs due to its national importance: “Cutivando Água Boa” and “Olhos 

d’Água”. First, “Cutivando Água Boa”, is a program from binational Itaipu and partners 

which aims the headwaters and riparian forests conservation, and sustainable methods of 

farming. Second, “Olhos d’Água”, is a Water-PES program accomplished by the NGO 

“Instituto Terra”, founded by the famous Brazilian photographer Sebastião Salgado. The 

project is sponsored by Vale and supported by (i) EMATER-MG (technical rural assistance) 

and (ii) the Manhuaçu river basin committee.  The Manhuaçu river basin is totally inserted in 

the Minas Gerais state, “Zona da Mata” and Doce river valley, with drainage area of 9,189 

km2. The investments in headwaters conservation have been increased by the  “Olhos 

d’Água” program, since 2013. At least US$ 630,000a were performed by the program 

between 2013 and mid-2015 (http://www.institutoterra.org/projetos/VALE/).  

More than 1.900 landowners have already signed Water-PES contracts in the Atlantic 

Forest, resulting in more than 48,000 ha of land managed for water resources conservation 

(Table 2). By far, the most common land management originating Water-PES is conservation 

of the remaining forest patches (Table 2.2). Atlantic Forest remnants are protected by a 
specific law (“Lei da Mata Atlântica”) and their legal suppression for other land uses is very 

restricted. Thus, PES for forest conservation is more acceptable by landowners than actions 

that directly affect their agricultural lands (Viani &amp;amp; Bracale, 2015). Payment values for 

landowners vary from US$ 8-891 (Table 2), reflecting differences for resource available for 

the project, methods of ES valuation and opportunity costs.

Most of the Atlantic Forest Water-PES projects have clear hydrological services 

objectives and defined their area of occurrence base on the relevance of them for hydrological 

services generation or conservation (Table 3.3). In addition, especially for forest restoration, 
they prioritize actions for riparian areas, critical areas for hydrological services. However, not 

all the projects have the PES values varying according to the amount and/or quality of the 

generated hydrological services, only few of them have already established hydrological 

monitoring and none of the initiatives condition the PES to direct measures of the 

hydrological services (Table 3.3). In fact, in all of the projects, payments to landowners are 
done assuming that implementation of eligible actions (forest restoration and conservation, 

soil conservation, etc.) guarantee the existence of the hydrological services. Thus, advances 

for hydrological services valuation and monitoring in Atlantic Forest Water-PES initiatives 

are needed.     

2.3. Ecohydrology as a tool for valuation of hydrological services  

River flow dynamics and the interaction of flow with landscape provide a large 

number of ES that can (i) improve water quality, (ii) create positive socioeconomic effects 

and (iii) regulate land use and water use. However, the conversion of natural land cover to 

human uses, henceforth called land-use/land-cover change (LULC), influences river water 

flows mainly by reducing the absorption and the filtration of water flows. In addition to the 

impacts of human activities, such as agriculture, urbanization, industry, rapid population 

growth, sub-urban development and building of dams, extensive research also shows the 

additional impact of climate change on ES (Ehret et al., 2014, Hallegatte et al., 2014, 

Marengo et al., 2014, Nelson et al., 2013, Palmer et al., 2009, Pedrono et al., 2016).  

On the one hand, changes in precipitation, air temperature and wind regimes are the 

main consequences of extreme climate variability and climate  change impacts on hydrologic 

services flow (Nickus et al., 2010). One recent example could be the drought of the megacity 

of Sao Paulo, where due to a drought during austral summer of 2013-14 the main reservoirs 

had reached storage levels of only 5% of their 1.3 billion m3 capacity, generating a severe 

water crisis aggravated by a combination of lack of rainfall, higher temperatures, increasing 

population and water consumption (Escobar, 2015, Nobre et al. 2016, Taffarello et al., 

2016a). On the other hand, at local and regional scales, ecosystem flows may be altered due to 

changes in the water cycle, changes in river flow regimes or changes in groundwater level and 

other factors. To quantify and integrate these hydrological and ecological processes, an 

ecohydrological framework can be applied (Fig. 2.2).

In a typical river basin scheme (Fig. 2.2-A), there are several ecohydrological variables. 

The geo-hydrological processes (Kobiyama et al., 1998), also known as eco-hydrologic 

processes, interact in a non-linear way (Mendiondo, 2008, Zalewski, 2014, 2015). Such 

processes define the river regime, the ecosystem flow and ES, generated because of soil 

conservation and the (non)protection of water resources and biodiversity in watersheds. 

A healthy river promotes responses to changes in the landscape and climate change. The 

natural sinuosity of the main channel across the floodplain produces flow characteristic and load 

discharges at the cross section. Thus, the main channel is defined up to the bankfull condition 

with water level at h* value. Flooding events above h* occupy the floodplain over a time series 

and define high flow regimes (h&gt;h*) in the flow duration curves. 

Each pulse flood over time (Fig. 2.2-B) can be characterized by frequency, intensity, 

amplitude and seasonality (Neiff et al., 2008, Richter et al., 1997). As a result, categories of 

sinuosity, continuity, diversity, dynamics, resilience and vulnerability constrained by 18 

ecohydrological variables can express the conditions of river ecosystems (Mendiondo, 2008). 

For example, an ecohydrological variable can determine the frequency of pulses for the number 

of flood pulses per time period (X3, Fig. 2.2-B). For a determined flood pulse (Fig. 2.2-C), the 

ecohydrological variable X10 defines the ratio of time duration above flood level and time 

duration of total flood pulse. The higher the X10, the stronger is the river biodiversity. Both 

ecohydrological variables X3 and X10 influence how pollutant loads can be lower or higher than 

that observed for flows at high water levels. Because water levels are related to river discharges, 

at non-linear relationships (X12 = 'Qy'h in Fig. 2.2-D), time series of water levels h(t) can be 

converted into flow discharges Q(t) at the same cross sections (Fig. 2.2-E). Similarly, situations 
of Q(t)&gt;Q* represent flood pulses.  

From the above discussion, LULC changes can alter normal flow regimes (Fig. 2.2-F), 

intensifying flow extremes with higher floods or lower droughts. Flow duration curves, 

represented by the frequency of time permanency of flows, usually depicts a monotonically 

downward flow curve for all curves measured at the river cross-section. A new ecohydrological 

variable X16 of changing reference flows, i.e., at 5% ('Q5%) and 95% ('Q95%) could be assessed 

for non-stationary conditions of flow duration curves. 

In summary, these new ecohydrological variables can help quantifying ES (in other words, 

assess how the landscape context influences the amount of hydrological services) in Water-PES 

schemes. From this interaction, the “water+climate” composition is the main sustainability 

element (Moss et al., 2010, Tucci &amp;amp; Mendes, 2006), directly influencing biodiversity. Since the 



31 
 

 

potential of hydrological services depends on the equilibrium of the water balance (variable 

given the natural oscillations or induced by impacts from anthropic and/or climatic factors), 

besides the functional distribution of the ecosystems on the watersheds, we propose a framework 

to achieve integrated assessments of ES in water-PES initiates. 

2.4. Impacts, Vulnerability and Adaptation linked to Water-PES Projects 
Some countries have made efforts to adapt to climate change and variability, for example, 

through the conservation of key ecosystems, compensation for ES, and the use of early-warning 

systems and climate forecasts. However, global change is a strong stressor that threatens human 

water security and biodiversity (Vörösmarty et al., 2010). Besides, there are different climate 

change scenarios for Brazil up to the end of the twenty-first century (Fig. 2.3), indicating how 
unpredictable the impacts are. The 2013-14 drought in South-East Brazil, mentioned before, 

which led to a water crisis for 85 million people, is an example of these hard to predict scenarios, 

which impact both freshwater ecosystems and people.  

The valuation of river health and associated ES involves several challenges regarding how 

to account for the vulnerabilities to land use and climate change impacts and uncertainties. Here 

we outline how an EbA contributes to reducing risks in three steps. First, we briefly introduce 

the impact-vulnerability-adaptation rationale (IVA). Second, we show the conditions that appear 

to fill the gap between the PES practices and on-hand opportunities from EbA to improve our 

knowledge on adaptation options. Finally, we discuss about expanding the classification of 

Water-PES projects, in an EbA approach, to enhance more efficient practices towards valuing 

ES.  

The vulnerability of an ecosystem can be viewed in the changes in ecohydrological 

variables (Figure 2.2). The flood pulses across river cross-sections, floodplain and regime 
duration are seen in the quantitative percentile flows (or flow duration curve). Climatic extreme 

events increase the flow 5% of the time and decrease the outflow 95% of the observed time 

period, hence a higher (in the ordinate) and flatter (in the axis) duration curve is found (Fig. 2-

G). Moreover, the higher water level (at the overflow height) can bring about a buffer effect of 

pollutants transported by the inadequate land-use. 

An EbA approach could result firstly from the ecohydrological monitoring baseline of the 

Water-PES projects, which will allow assessing the maintenance of ecohydrological health of 

river systems. This proposal is flexible, applicable in other watersheds and offers a good cost-

benefit relationship, besides being easily understood and desirable since the PES has been 

recognized as a measuring indicator for the EbA (BFN/GIZ, 2013).

end of the twenty-first century. The symbols in the leaves (change indicators) are the same used in the 
IPCC AR5 (IPCC, 2014) and the degrees of reliability are evaluated according to the consistency between 
the projections of three regional INPE models and the IPCC AR5 global models. 

 

2.4.1. Risk assessment and adaptation  

The types of admissible risks in ES are manageable at the river basin scale have been 

discussed (Lin et al., 2013, Wunder, 2006). At least one previous study has emphasized the need 

for research incentives in the risk management area and adaptive management (AR-5 IPCC, 

2014). Then, Naeem et al. (2015) found that of 118 USA-PES projects analyzed, most do not 

ensure scientific integrity in their environmental interventions, among other factors, because 

there are no metrics to assess the risks, as for instance, climate change. Aiming to fill part of this 

gap, we recommend that water risks of Water-PES projects be categorized in terms of 

vulnerability, impacts and adaptation strategies. 

First, risk assessment is related to a specific combination of factors related to hazards, 

exposure and vulnerability, which can evolve to a disaster condition. Second, hazards are closely 



33 
 

 

related to ecosystem variables at extreme behaviors across spatiotemporal scales where 

ecosystems develop their respective functions. These react to decision-making drivers and 

scenarios (MEA, 2005). However, the degree of susceptibility of the ecosystems to water 

hazards includes their characteristics with regard to vulnerability conditions, especially 

considering hydrological prediction in ungauged or poorly gauged basins.  

Third, impacts are addressed in terms of comparing vulnerability characteristics with the 

support capacity of the environment to counterpart hazards (Montanari &amp;amp; Koutsoyiannis, 2014). 

The adaptation options are the types of non-structural or structural measures to help the 

ecosystem recover to the equilibrium conditions without the effects of risks (Palmer et al., 2009). 

This recovering capacity, included in the resilience concept (Baggio et al., 2015, Russell et al., 

2012, Tanner et al., 2015), is scale-dependent and dependent on the type of risk condition 

(Mendiondo, 2010), which could be incorporated in the Water-PES projects in the long term 

(Mazzocato et al., 2013, Naeem et al., 2015, van de Sand, 2012, Wunder, 2006). 

 

2.4.2. Water-PES initiatives &amp;amp; Ecohydrology  

Linking ecohydrologic processes and human well-being is crucial in the ecosystem 

services framework (Brauman, 2015). To achieve better water quality by reducing 

eutrophication, some ecohydrological categories can be useful to address water challenges (Bunn 

&amp;amp; Arthington, 2002, Hannah et al., 2011, Vannote et al., 1980, Zalewski, 2015). All these 

categories are classified in accordance with principles of continuity, dynamics, resilience, 

vulnerability and diversity, which affect ecosystem interactions across the river basin scale 

(Richter et al., 1997). The delivery of hydrological services is measured (for example, 

measurement of flow, water quality variables or sediment levels) and/or simulated in 

ecohydrological models, such as SWAT (Bressiani et al., 2015; Francesconi et al., 2016), 

InVEST (Bremer et al., 2016, Guimarães, 2013, Tallis et al., 2011, 2012) or RIOS (Vogl et al., 

2016). Besides, indirect methods to find this delivery can be quantifying water treatment costs to 

the end-users of hydrological services, as discussed by Osuna et al. (2014), or investigating the 

value of a protected park’s water contribution to end-user (Strobel et al., 2007). In any of these 

methodologies, assessments of ES through its quantification are needed. In this context, Water-

PES projects would have to benefit of ecohydrology as a promising tool for includes metrics in 

interventions. 

Table 2.3 shows that, with the exception of 1 initiative (Camboriu), there have not been 
ecohydrologic monitoring since before start of the interventions (to create the baseline). It is a 



34 
 

 
  

challenge to build integrated monitoring guidelines which encompass actions before, during (to 

assess project performance and provide feedbacks) and after the end of Water-PES project 

actions. 

Forward these guidelines, at least 4 ecohydrological categories are feasible to monitor in 

Water-PES projects, such as continuity, diversity, resilience and vulnerability (see Mendiondo, 

2008, Table 5). Integrating hydrology and limnology in a holistic problem-solving strategy, 

ecohydrologic tools improve water quality for freshwater ecosystems and become easier 

watersheds restoration (Zalewski &amp;amp; Robarts, 2003).  

In this context, both freshwater quality and quantity play a key role in network of 

provisioning and regulating ecosystem services interactions. Qualitative and quantitative 

freshwater monitoring should be performed in an integrated manner. From this perspective, we 

recommend the plan and accomplishment of freshwater monitoring in the long term. It is crucial 

to link the monitoring data to Water-PES project outcomes, revealing the quality and frequency 

of available data where benefits for ecosystem and landowners can be realized – this is scarce in 

Brazilian Atlantic Forest’s Water-PES projects. If baseline and freshwater monitoring exist, the 

evaluation of project performance based on delivery of ES become easier. In turn, it provides 

reliability for ES buyer and allows comparison among Water-PES projects. Thus, a checklist of 

ecohydrological indicators, water quality variables and river morphology characteristics would 

help to delineate and classify the Water-PES projects. It is shown in Table 2.4.  
In spite of the expansion of Water-PES projects in Atlantic Forest Brazil, they have not 

fully implemented hydrological monitoring (Table 2.3). Besides, there are inconsistencies or the 
absence of standards, definitions and methodologies for the hydrological monitoring in Water-

PES projects. Nested Catchment Experiments (NCE), comparing freshwater monitoring from 

headwaters to downstream river (Mendiondo et al., 2007, Zaffani et al., 2015), are suitable to 

study Water-PES under flood pulse approach (Fig. 2 A-C). NCE are flexible in terms of river 

characterization (Rosgen, 1994), geomorphologic river networks (Rodrigues-Iturbe, 2000) and 

“the river active area” methodology (Smith et al., 2008). Pollution loads across nested scales 

show how ecosystem diversity is affected by human-driven occupation of the basin, and also 

nested scales can show the possible further effects of river restoration through Water-PES.

Another opportunity could be implementing integrated load and flow duration curves 

(Cunha et al., 2012) for hydrological ES assessment. For example, (i) in-situ observations of 

water bodies could elucidate the role played by LULC at upstream catchments involved in 

PES (Taffarello et al., 2016a) and (ii) for the improvement of a semi-distributed model with 

experimental data. To date, we have observed a good relationship between phosphate and 

nitrate loads versus drainage area (0.66 to 925 km2) and have demonstrated the actual need for 

ecohydrological monitoring to test the PES benefit assumptions and to improve scientific 

frameworks including tools, metrics and methods for Water-PES projects selection. 

Monthly quality data are limited and the planning and execution of field campaigns 

are costly and time consuming in Brazil. Thus, ecohydrological models are necessary to 

construct the load duration curves. Regarding available data sources for applying 

ecohydrological models in Brazil, Bressiani et al. (2015), in a review on Brazilian SWAT 

applications, list an extensive array of data sources and include on-line locations for many of 

the data sources in an Appendix. Recently, SWAT has been used as a methodological 

framework for quantifying ES to support decision-making (see review of Francesconi et al. 

2016). Besides SWAT, other agricultural watershed models can help in facing this challenge 

(Alvarenga et al., 2016, Cuartas et al., 2012, De Mello et al., 2016). 

Using quality and quantity data for the same period of time, collected preferably at the 

same sites (or selecting as the nearest stations) enable ecosystem functions evaluation by 

applying qualitative and quantitative permanence curves. Future scenarios of climate and 

land-use changes can be evaluated by these curves, as shown schematically (Fig. 2 F-G).  

Moreover, by using the grey water footprint (amount of freshwater required to 

assimilate pollutants) related to nitrogen and phosphorous inputs (Hoekstra &amp;amp; Chapagain, 

2008, Hoekstra et al., 2011, Mekonnen et al., 2015), qualitative and quantitative permanence 

curves could be used to quantify the ES, which could be measured as the volume of 

freshwater needed to dilute the pollutant loads (Zhang et al., 2010), i.e., the water required for 

the self-depuration capacity of rivers. Concerning the needs for adaptation actions, we suggest 

evaluating the grey water footprint for nitrate, since nitrogen is one of the most mobile 

element. Both point and diffuse nitrogen source impacts on freshwater can be investigated 

with ecohydrological models. Then we could assess: (i) how polluting loads are produced 

under different land use in the current climate and in the future, and (ii) the impacts of best 

management practices (BMP), such as EbA (Fig. 2.4).

Based on Naeem et al. (2015), we propose that Water-PES projects should use 

ecohydrological variables (Fig. 2) for delineation, monitoring and comparison of Water-PES 

projects. This facilitates the access to public and private investments, which in turn will 

strengthen and enhance the EbA in Brazil.  

In essence, the full efficiency of an EbA mechanism could be measured across the basin 

and compared to other initiatives in the same basin. Ultimately, Water-PES tradeoffs could be 

relatively different depending on the scale used to analyze and the variables incorporated in 

the assessment and valuation of hydrological ES. This comparison, through hierarchy metrics 

and analysis of the selected ecohydrological categories, enables to reflect on how the EbA 

methodologies, specifically Water-PES projects, can minimize the vulnerability to the impact 

of climate chang 

 

2.5. Water-PES as ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change 
Ecosystem-based Adaptation addresses the links between climate change, water cycle, 

biodiversity and sustainable resources management. Ecohydrological approaches, by 



38 
 

 
  

preserving and enhancing ecosystems, allow to measure and evaluate these interactions. It is 

essential that EbA strategies contribute to the resilience of ecosystems (Fiering, 1982, Tanner 

et al., 2015,), protect livelihoods and mitigate poverty (Engel et al., 2008, Hallegatte et al., 

2014, Pagiola et al., 2010). 

Considering the EbA approach, Water-PES should be spatially implemented in river 

basins, preferably in heterogeneous landscapes, and with efficient technical support to the 

farmers. Studies show that carefully implementing these programs can bring significant water 

quality (Keeler et al., 2012) and biodiversity benefits (Whittingham, 2011). However, the 

potential of PES in climate change adaptation has been little realized (van de Sand et al., 

2014). 

Major risks and uncertainties surround the extent to which climate variability, climate 

change and other changes could modify the water cycle in relevant regions for the 

implementation of PES projects such as the EbA type. For example, changing rainfall, snow 

and ice melt patterns could affect how water transfers through soils and ecosystems and hence 

river flows and groundwater recharge. These changes present potential risks and benefits to 

society. Increased water security for developing countries occurs in integrated systems for 

ecosystem sustainability under climate change (Ambrizzi et al., 2007, Liu et al., 2015, 

Marengo et al., 2011). This means it is vital to ensure sufficient quality, quantity and 

distribution of water for productive use, ecosystems, through environmental flows 

(Arthington et al., 2006, 2010, Arthington, 2015), human health and to minimize water-

related risks to people, environments and economies. 

While there are many Water-PES programs in Brazilian Atlantic Forest (Fig. 2.1, 

Table 2.1), it is still hard to put a price on some other valuable hydrologic services provided 
by Amazonian forests, such as the recycling of atmospheric moisture and its transport to 

regions outside, such as the Atlantic Forest.  

Key questions still should be solved to achieve ecosystem sustainability services. For 

example, should the states in central and southern Brazil pay the Amazonian states because 

the rain that falls in their fertile lands comes from the Amazon region?; How much does one 

cubic meter of water costs? And how much water moves from Amazonia to central-southern 

Brazil? One thing we know is that changes in forest coverage and the services offered by the 

forest may affect the moisture provision from Amazonia to central-southern Brazil. The 

provision of these services may be a determinant for vulnerability that is enhanced by climate 

change. Failure to reduce the magnitude or rate of climate change will plausibly lead to 



39 
 

 

changes (often decreases) in the value of ES provided, including moisture recycling. 

2.6. Conclusions 

Water-PES initiatives have rapidly expanded and advanced in the Atlantic Forest in 

Brazil. However, most of them still lack ecohydrological monitoring strategies, which would 

provide the baseline for the standardization, comparison and hierarchization of projects. We 

argue this is essential to validate implemented land management actions as generators of 

hydrological services and, consequently, to prove effectiveness of PES projects in providing 

hydrologic ES. Moreover, this approach could in turn increase public and private awareness 

and investments in Water-PES initiatives.  

Concerning the multiple uses of water, the balance for maintaining the services that 

watersheds provide is only achieved through equitable water governance and ES 

management. We highlight that any adaptive management cannot be achieved without 

ecohydrological monitoring. Thus, integrated assessment and valuation of ES should use 

ecohydrology variables as tools.  

Finally, ecohydrological monitoring is crucial to reduce EbA uncertainties, contribute to 

consolidate water resources information system, improve ecohydrological modelling and 

integrated water resources management. Future work remains to be done to link the 

hydrological services to dynamic and integrated assessment models to better understand how 

the complex processes of land use and climate changes affect the environment.

Abstract 

Both Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) and Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) 
have a wide range of definitions that include many economic instruments for nature 
conservation. Although the generation and maintenance of payment for hydrologic ecosystem 
services (Water-PES) is expanding in Brazil, there are difficulties in the implementation of 
projects. Due to the complexity and non-linearity of the geomorphological processes, also 
affecting both EbA and Water-PES goals, monitoring quali-quantitative aspects of streams 
have been here addressed as a useful management tool. This study presents the Freshwater 
Monitoring Plan (FMP) of the Water Producer/PCJ project, operating since 2009, in order to: 
i) evaluate the impact of project actions under quali-quantitative aspects; and ii) promote the 
incorporation of FMP’s elements in water resources management. FMP of the Water 
Producer/PCJ project has been implemented following the conditions for efficiency (baseline, 
long-term scale compatible with the actions of the project, in the experimental and reference 
watersheds). Spatial and temporally, FMP is being implemented from upstream to 
downstream in catchments with areas ranging from 17 to 130 km . This new proposal favors 
the quantification and valuation of hydrologic services that could be assessed by 
ecohydrologic monitoring (Chapter 4 of this Thesis) and modeling (Chapter 5 of this Thesis). 
Thus, we look forward to the consolidation of the Brazilian information system of water 
resources, the reduction of modeling uncertainties and integrated assessment of the 
consequences of land-use/land-cover change that strongly impact goals of EbA and Water-
PES initiatives.

3.1. Introduction 

The hydrologic ecosystem services, hereafter referred as hydrologic services, are the 

ecohydrologic natural processes arising from river flow dynamics and flow/riparian areas 

interaction which benefit people. These processes can, for example, improve water quality, 

regulate flood risks, increase recreational opportunities and create positive socioeconomic 

effects. Hydrologic services are quantified by quali-quantitative river monitoring. The Active 

River Area assessment (Smith et al., 2008; Palmer et al., 2009) methods can also be applied in 

the monitoring, as it considers the hydrologic connectivity and natural variability of riparian 

areas from the headwaters downstream to the catchment’s   outlet. Several authors have 

proposed definitions of payments for ecosystem services (PES) for the water resources or 

biodiversity protection, and carbon sequestration. Costanza et al. (1997) define them as 

compensation for the benefits people obtain from ecosystems. They are considered voluntary 

transactions in which a determined ecosystem service is purchased from a provider under the 

condition of securing the service provision (Wunder, 2006).  Pagiola &amp;amp; Platais (2007) added 

generating positive externalities to this concept. Balvanera et al. (2012) define them as the 

availability (or utility) of ecosystems for human needs. Furthermore, Muradian &amp;amp; Rival 

(2012) relate PES with policy prospects and partnerships to align decision-making on land 

use. The definition of PES is sufficiently broad to encompass various economic instruments 

for environmental conservation (Pagiola, von Glehn &amp;amp; Taffarello, 2013). On the one hand, 

ecohydrological processes (i.e. Zalewski, 2010; Mendiondo, 2008, among other authors) 

interact nonlinearly. These processes affect biodiversity and primary production, and define 

the river regime, environmental flows and hydrologic ecosystem services (Taffarello &amp;amp; 

Mendiondo, 2013). Specifically for Water-PES, the potential provision of these services 

depends on the water-balance equilibrium of flows and pollution loads (Cunha, Calijuri &amp;amp; 

Mendiondo, 2012). On the other hand, Water-PES are dependant on the relationship between 

availability and demand, variable according to both (i) natural fluctuations or induced by the 

impacts of human activities, and (ii) functional and distribution conditions of the ecosystems 

in   the   watersheds.   In   this   interaction,   the   “water   +   climate”   composition is the main 

sustainability element for water security. Moreover, the insignificant water uses defined by 

river basin committee based on Brazilian and Sao Paulo state water resources laws (n. 

9433/1997 and n. 7663/1991, respectively) add a recognized stress on water security. The 

“insignificant   uses”   demand a detailed study on water withdrawal and wastewater disposal of 

small rural properties to ensure seasonal safe drinking water in these critical subbasins, 

strategic for public supply and for ecosystem services delivery. The objective of the Water 



52 
 

 
  

Producer/PCJ project freshwater monitoring is to evaluate the PES economic instrument to 

stimulate the use of voluntary conservation practices for soil conservation, forest restoration 

in Permanent Preservation Areas (APP), and conservation of remaining forest fragments. It is 

a pioneering pilot project in Sao Paulo state which includes public-private partnerships 

(Mazzocato, Taffarello &amp;amp; Mendiondo, 2013), with the aim of providing support for larger 

scale projects (Padovezi et al., 2013). The objectives of the FMP of Water-PES projects are: 

- Characterize the natural freshwater quality of the catchments covered by the project 

to consolidate the respective PCJ/ River Basin Plan. 

- Determine the baseline of the project based on land-use/land-cover information, 

questionnaires with information on environmental and socioeconomic perception; 

- Assess trends and hydrologic conditions, concentrations of monitored pollutants and 

the expected limits for the re-systematization of water bodies; 

- Identify areas with potential water quality changes; 

- Promote mitigating actions for the prevention and control of soil and water pollution;  

- Assess the effectiveness of project actions and long-term adaptation strategies; 

- Provide consistent information to assess the maintenance and future expansion of the 

project or its replication in other Brazilian regions through new PES public policies; 

- Encourage the creation and maintenance of real-time monitoring database, which are 

able to issue environmental alerts, reducing the vulnerability2 of the watersheds and 

productive sectors inserted there. 

3.2. Scope of this work 
Thus, the objectives of this work are: (i) assess the impact of conservation actions in 

the Water Producer/PCJ project through the freshwater monitoring plan (FMP) with key 

integration to EbA and Water-PES projecs; and (ii) support the incorporation of FMP 

elements through water resources management tools, such as: information systems, river 

basin plan, freshwater quality standards, water rights concessions and charging for water 

resources uses according to the current norms (Brazilian Water Law 9.433/97, Sao Paulo State 

Water Law No.7.663/91, No12.183/05 and Decree 50.667/06).  

                                                 

 
2Vulnerability  is the state of a sy stem exp osed to risks, controlled by  biop hy sical and socio-cultural factors at 

different temp oral and sp atial scales, combined with its resp onsiveness (INCLINE/USP, 2013).

3.3. Material and Methods 
3.3.1. Study area 

The study area includes watersheds that contribute to the Piracicaba, Capivari and 

Jundiaí (PCJ) river basins, covering 15.304 km2. In the Sao Paulo portion of the PCJ river 

basin, the Water Resources Management Unit No. 5 (UGRHI-5) has 14.178 km2 (92.6% of 

the basin area), and the rest of the UGRHI-5 territory of the PCJ basins (7.4%) is located in 

Minas Gerais state. The PCJ basins have higher economic development and per capita income 

in Brazil. However, due to the high population density (301 hab/km2) compared to other 

Brazilian river basins, the use of this water is conflicting and eutrophication of the water 

sources is at an advanced stage (Cobrape, 2011). Because of it, in the last decade, the 

headwaters of the sub-basin of the Atibainha and Jaguari rivers become of strategic interest. 

The implementation of charging for the use of water resources in the PCJ Committees in 2007 

allowed that part of the funds of water charging could be applied in the Water Producer/PCJ 

project. In mid-2013 the project area covered 252 hectares in Joanópolis/Nazaré Paulista 

cities, state of Sao Paulo. After three years of contracts between landowners and the financial 

borrower from PCJ Committees (2011-2014), the project area was 489 hectares, being 99 

hectares of soil conservation, 68 hectares of forest restoration and the major part of forest 

conservation, i. e., 391 hectares (Taffarello et al., submitted).On account of the prior 

information and the scarcity of native vegetation, the catchments being part of the FMP are 

previously selected: Cancã (97 km2 ) and Cachoeira dos Pretos (130.4 km2), in Joanópolis, 

and Moinho (17.6 km2) in Nazaré Paulista (Figure 3.1). 

3.3.2. Methods 

Regarding the self-purification3 process of rivers and streams, freshwater monitoring 

is critical for understanding the changes of pollutant concentrations in different seasons 

(Bottino, 2008; Mendiondo, 2008). To assess self-purification characteristics, quali-

quantitative parameters were included into the FMP of the headwaters of the main tributary 

rivers to Sistema Cantareira: Jaguari (1.000 km2), Cachoeira (392 km2) and Atibainha (315 

km2) to find possible seasonal changes of pollutants or macronutrients (see Table 3.1). 

 
                                                 

 
3Self-purification is the restoration of the water quality  after the changes induced by the discharge of 

effluents. The main parameters changed due to self-purification are the dissolved oxygen concentrations, 

biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and pathogenic microorganisms, river contaminants (von Sperling, 2005).

Land-use/land-cover (LULC) change impact ecosystems and the services they provide 

in diverse scales. Regarding hydrologic services, LULC change is one of the most significant 

anthropogenic pressures which change water flows and modify regulating hydrological 

services (Brauman, 2015; Rounsevell et al., 2012; Daily et al., 1997). In addition, slope, 

topography, soil development and soil depth are also terrestrial characteristics of the 

watersheds which impact hydrologic services, as we have shown in Figures 1.1 and 2.1 
(Chapters 1 and 2, respectively of this thesis) and were reported by Koschke et al. (2014), 

Terrado et al. (2013), among others.  

The land-use/land-cover (LULC) changes of microcatchments contributing to public 

drinking supply are crucial for the production of water in adequate quantities and quality 

conditions (Whately &amp;amp; Cunha, 2007). Also, these changes lead to risks of potential water 

crisis with impacts on vulnerable ecosystems and people (Tundisi &amp;amp; Tundisi, 2015; Gordon et 

al., 2008).

To verify how anthropic activities for one hand and Water-PES actions, on the other 

hand, can further influence environmental quality, FMP investigates the past conditions (year 

2003) and near current conditions (year 2010) of LULC (Figure 3.2). This diagnosis helps 

understanding the current environmental quality of catchments for prospective EbA initiatives 

using this FMP. Also, FMP improves the monitoring of Water Producer/PCJ project, as 

auxiliary tool in planning and selecting quali-quantitative sampling sites under LULC change, 

regarding water yield, seasonal flow-with-load regimes and ecohydrological variables (see 

Figure 2.1 of the thesis). After 6 GTM-Hydro meetings and several studies, we conclude that 

specific conditions are crucial for effectivity of the freshwater monitoring. See 3.4.1 Section. 
Comparing LULC in years 2003 and 2010, regarding soil uses, Figure 3.2 shows that 

the anthropic use is higher in Cancã catchment (66%) than in Moinho (around 50%) and 

Cachoeira do Pretos catchments (49% in 2003 and 38% in 2010). There is a trend to reduce 



56 
 

 
  

agriculture areas in Cancã and Cachoeira dos Pretos catchments, which is not observed in 

Moinho catchment. Both in Cancã and in Cachoeira dos Pretos catchments part of agriculture 

has been replaced by reforestation. This issue is relevant for the recovery of ecosystem since 

both catchments are located in Cachoeira basin. Joanópolis municipality, where larger part of 

Cachoeira basin is located, has 80% of its protected area occupied by pasture, agriculture, and 

bare soil (Whately &amp;amp; Cunha, 2007). Then, current consumptive water use and intensive 

agriculture impact the blue and the green water availability in the Cachoeira basin (Rodrigues 

et al., 2014).  

Although the Water Producer/PCJ project started in 2009, FMP is at an early 

implementation stage, which enhanced since 2013 onwards (see Taffarello et al., 2016). We 

believe that this FPM enables posing questions such as: Do Water-PES’ actions of the Water 

Producer/PCJ project improve and conserve the water quality and water flow regulation in the 

headwaters under LULC changes of the Cantareira Water Supply System? To address 

answers through EbA methods, ecohydrologic experiments and modeling are needed. Using 

field campaigns (episodic monitoring) and official database (systematic monitoring) from 

agencies engaged in FMP at PCJ committees, i.e. CETESB, DAEE, SABESP, INMET, ANA, 

CODEAGRO, CEMADEN, human impacts on quali-quantitative freshwater regimes are 

verified (Taffarello et al., 2013a; Cunha, Calijuri &amp;amp; Mendiondo, 2012). Furthermore, possible 

positive impacts of Water-PES   project’s conservation actions are viable to screen explicitly 

through FMP. Further details about field evidences of episodic FMP and about ecohydrologic 

modeling with EbA scenarios are, respectively, in Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 of this thesis.

3.4. Results and Discussion 

From the EbA approach, the Integrated Group of River Basins (Núcleo Integrado de 

Bacias Hidrográficas, NIBH) of the Sao Carlos School of Engineering, University of Sao 

Paulo with support from The Nature Conservancy (TNC), drafted a FMP proposal for Water 

Producer/PCJ project based on the document “Water   and   Soil   Monitoring   Protocol   – Water 

Producer Program” (Diederichsen et al., in press). This FMP is in accordance with the 

National Plan for Water Quality (PNQA) of Brazilian National Water Agency (ANA), and 

with part of the hydrological monitoring in   Water   Funds’   case   studies   in   Latin   America,  

organized by Bremer, Vogl, de Bièvre &amp;amp; Petry (2016). The FMP was presented to Water 

Producer/PCJ project’s   partners   in   a Workshop held in May 2013 in Atibaia municipality, Sao 

Paulo state. Also, we fully presented a version of this FMP plan at the XX Brazilian 

Simposium of Water Resources, held 2013 in Bento Gonçalves, Rio Grande do Sul state 

(Taffarello et al., 2013b).  

Metrics and indicators for evaluating PES effectivity are essential. Regarding the 

Water Producer/PCJ project, the HMP, especially Figure 3.2, seeks to help assessing the 

Water-PES implementation. Examples of these metrics or indicators can be: 1) PES project 

area/watershed area; 2) benefited population4/total watershed population; 3) applied financial 

resources related to benefits generated (lower water treatment costs and higher water yield, 

for example). Thus, this HMP can help obtaining short- and long-term Water-PES project 

performance, a scientific guideline for PES according to Naeem et al. (2015).  

Then, to apply the quali-quantitative monitoring plan, which can further allow the 

assessment of PES implementation, some requirements are needed to monitoring sites 

selection. The first monitoring sites were determined based on scale compatible with Water-

PES actions, aspects related to LULC changes and comparing EbA-reference catchments to 

catchments targeted of conservation actions of Water-PES in the scope of Water 

Producer/PCJ project (Figure 3.3 and Table 3.2). Local LULC change allowed elucidating 

the complexity of soil uses verified from field in loco diagnosis of water yield at these 

headwaters. Field evidences showed LULC was as relevant on watersheds as used for public 

supply, because local modifications impacted water quantity and quality. Freshwater quality 

was jeopardizing because of agrochemicals used in conventional agriculture, and erosion 
                                                 

 
4Benefited population, also called PES beneficiaries, here means the number of inhabitants living in 1) the PES 
project areas, 2) downstream the PES project area, and/or 3) regions with flow transfers from PES project areas.

process due to urbanization. Also, urbanization and economic activities were performed at 

unappropriated areas, without planning, damaging water yield (as pointed by Whately &amp;amp; 

Cunha, 2007).  

We found erosion field evidences in these subtropical Oxisols during in loco visits 

were expressive as previously related by Pereira &amp;amp; Teixeira Filho (2009) and PCJ (2011). 

Mendiondo et al. (2007) also related field evidences of surface flow water pathways related to 

erosion patterns in catchment laying on Oxisols with erosion rates of ca. 1 t/ha per year and 

variable concentration of suspended solids. This evaluation justifies the FPM monitoring of 

water flows and erosion on the watershed scale. In mid-2013, the monitoring includes two 

Data Collection Platforms (DCP), four fluviometric scales and two barologgers. Barometric 

readings are synchronized with the level readings. The equipment purchase, installation and 

maintenance are the responsibility of ANA, TNC, WWF and EESC/USP. The location of 

equipments installation was determined by the Hydrologic Monitoring Working Group 

(GTM-Hydro) of the Water Producer/PCJ project, shown in Table 3.2 and Figure 3.4.

3.4.1. Effective Monitoring Conditions 

a – Baseline conditions 
Monitoring should be implemented preferably before start of LULC interventions. 

This is necessary to identify the baseline and to serve as a temporal analysis reference. The 

baseline can identify possible positive changes as a result of the expansion of ecosystem 

services promoted by the project, as well as ecohydrologic variables related, thereby 

encompassing the integration of quali-quantitative variables. 

 

b - Long-term monitoring 

The PES pilot projects should necessarily have long-term monitoring. Regarding both 

quali-quantitative   aspects,   “long-term”   is   understood   as   a   horizon   span   ranging between 30 

and 50 years, to consolidate legal and socio-economic elements as well as LULC change. An 

operational framework is required to document the changes for the regular storing and 

analysis of the field data collection.  

 

c - Scale compatibility with project actions 

It is crucial to have a significant geographic scope, integrating PES interventions at 

local scales, which will promote the maintenance and recovery of native soil vegetation in the 

river basin scale, because it is assumed that the monitoring data obtained will reflect the 

expected benefits from the actions through EbA. However, it is not easy to implement forest 

restoration and soil conservation activities in a significant portion of the basin and within a 

short period of time.  

Thus, it is recommended to implement the monitoring structure in the catchment 

scales scale, when there is a sufficient range of land use changes, to enable perceiving in the 

short term the impacts on water quality and flow regime.  

 

d – Reference and intervention catchments 
The improvement and maintenance of the water quality conditions and hydrologic 

regime will be included in the monitoring of catchments where the forest cover has changed 

significantly, named as   “intervention”   catchment. A property located in the same catchment 

was selected (which has the same physiographic, climatic and environmental characteristics), 

but with no significant change in the original vegetation cover (minimum of 80% of native 

vegetation cover), named as  “reference”   catchment 



62 
 

 
  

3.4.2. Types of monitoring 

Spatial monitoring (nested catchment experiment)  

For the experimental catchments, monitoring quali-quantitative control sites of water 

yield is selected through Nested Catchment Experiment method (NCE,  McDonnell et al., 

2007; Mendiondo et al., 2007), as follows. Headwater reference catchments of 1st or 2nd 

order, with no forest restoration and soil conservation interventions are compared to 

headwater catchments with project interventions. Both inside the same basin of 3rd order. 

 

Temporal monitoring 

The variables have to be collected (i) systematically (quantitative), with time interval 

as a fraction of the observed time of concentrations, ie., the average response time of a 

rainfall-runoff process (Tucci, 1993; Tucci, 2008); and (ii) episodic (qualitative) based on 

seasonal campaigns (Bieroza et al., 2014; Abell, Hamilton &amp;amp; Rutherford, 2013; Chiwa et al., 

2010). Specifically, in the Water Producer/PCJ project freshwater monitoring, we set uped the 

time-step of continuous monitoring variables of water level, pressure and temperature each 15 

minutes. The seasonal field campaigns have choosen to be bimonthly, to investigate the 

seasonal dynamics of river regimes, as explained in Figure 2.1 (Chapter 2 of this thesis).  

We also suggest using flow-load duration curves in the monitoring of the Water 

Producer/PCJ project, to describe the pollution loads according to flow rates, facilitating to 

visualize the quali-quantitative natural behavior of freshwater resources (Chen et al., 2011; 

Cunha et al., 2012; Taffarello et al., 2013a).  Flow and load duration curves demonstrate 

changes in land use or climate in the watersheds (Taffarello &amp;amp; Mendiondo, 2013). Studying 

flow-load duration curves under different scenarios, for example, including EbA or different 

rates of wastewater treatment, allows evaluating hydrologic services provided by Water-PES, 

addressing a more effective and reliable water security.  

3.5. Conclusions &amp;amp; Recommendations  

Regarding the Water Producer/PCJ project, the following actions can be envisaged 

with the freshwater monitoring here proposed: 1) complement the water resources information 

system in the PCJ Watersheds Committee; 2) Incorporate the information system in ANA’s  

database (PNQA), CETESB and DAEE; 3) Estimate the detailed water balance in 

experimental watersheds; 4) Anticipate the frequency curves of flow and loads; 5) Assess 

water availability for water use permission; 6) Anticipate the balance of pollutant loads and 



63 
 

 

the re-categorizing of water bodies; 7) Estimate the green, blue and gray water flows, and 

their water footprint (according to Hoekstra et al., 2011); 8) Identify and prioritize low-

sustainability critical areas by comparing availabilities and demands within the PCJ 

watersheds; 9) Improve the information quality of user registration; 10) Support adaptation 

strategies for potential climate changes and mitigation measures for the medium and long 

term; 11) Identify possible changes in the quality and quantity of water resources resulting 

from the conservation actions of the Water Producer/PCJ project; 12) Strengthen institutional 

arrangements in PES projects undertaken in the River Basin Committee.  

Our study consists of a new freshwater monitoring proposal with variables that can be 

quantified in the flow and load duration curves. Advancing the monitoring of Water-PES 

projects contributes toward consolidating the Brazilian information system on water 

resources, improving hydrologic models and updating the integrated environmental 

assessment. Besides, the hydrological monitoring here proposed can help obtaining short- 

and, if continuously applyied, long-term evidence of Water-PES project performance. 

Estimate project or program performance is a scientific guideline for Water-PES, linked to 

ecological sustainability principle for ensures project durability, according to Naeem et al. 

(2015). As a result, the real sustainability of ecosystem services can be better assessed and 

valued in the long term.

ABSTRACT 

Integrating seasonal patterns of water availability and land-use/land-cover change is 

crucial in watershed planning. Often, these are not considered under hydrological extremes 

affecting decision making. This article presents results from a multi-site, nested catchment 

experiment carried out during a dry period in the Cantareira Water Supply System, South-East 

Brazil, linking quali-quantitative freshwater monitoring to land-use/land-cover change. 

Results from 17 catchments show regional behaviour for nitrate loads and drainage areas 

(0.66-925 km2). An inverse correlation between forest cover and water yield was observed. 

Despite forest growth in spatial extent, nutrient loads showed potential hazards for water 

security.

4.1 Introduction 

Rivers provide goods and services linked to the flow dynamics and the interaction 

between flow and landscape. These sustain the integrity of the ecosystems. However, land-use 

changes such as urbanization, industrial development, deforestation and intensive agriculture 

with rapid population growth and climate change threaten the supply of safe drinking water 

and ecological integrity. These changes lead to risks of potential water crisis with impacts on 

vulnerable ecosystems and people (Tundisi &amp;amp; Tundisi, 2015; Gordon et al., 2008).  

The International Hydrological Programme of UNESCO defined water security as the 

“capacity   to   guarantee   drinking   water   access   in   acceptable   conditions   of   quality   and   quantity,  

for   sustaining   human   and   ecosystem   health”   (UNESCO,   2012).   Therefore,   water security is an 

interdisciplinary and multidimensional concept to assess the tolerable level of water-related 

risks to society (Bakker, 2012). Water security encompasses a variety of multipurpose water 

resources (Pahl-Wostl, 2015; Sivapalan et al., 2014), for both consumptive and 

nonconsumptive uses, which affect sustainability (Vörösmarty et al., 2010) and water 

allocation (Hellegers &amp;amp; Leflaive, 2015; Hoekstra, 2013). 

Water scarcity can impact these basic aspects of water security. Integrating 

quantitative, qualitative and seasonal aspects of water security is a crucial topic in river basin 

planning, especially concerning strategic water supply basins. For example, in Brazil the 

decreasing freshwater volumes in rivers, as well as increased water temperatures and elevated 

concentrations of nutrients, have caused frequent cyanobacteria blooms (Tundisi &amp;amp; Tundisi, 

2015). In watersheds with marked land-use/land-cover (LULC) change, field monitoring of 

both the quantity and quality of freshwater also under drought conditions is an important input 

for decision making. 

In large countries like Brazil, those uncertainties resulting from water monitoring are 

inherent to the biome diversity and territorial extension. For example, the Brazilian Policy on 

Water Resources (Law Nº. 9433; Brazil, 1997) determined water security by integrating river 

water quantity with quality and the decentralization of water resources management (Porto &amp;amp; 

Porto, 2002). The objectives of the Brazilian water law are to: (i) assess the evolution of water 

quality; (ii) identify critical areas of pollution; and (iii) assess the effectiveness of water 

resources management. However, there are still large gaps in the water quality, quantity and 

seasonal monitoring in Brazil related to ecosystem services (Libanio, 2015; Pagiola, von 

Glehn &amp;amp; Taffarello, 2013), especially under climate extremes (Nobre et al., 2016; Marengo et 

al., 2015; De Araújo et al. 2004).

4.1.2 Water Supply Programmes and Environmental Conservation 

Water yield has been affected by land-use and climate changes, which in turn has 

strained the conservation or restoration of water resources management (Palmer &amp;amp; Filoso, 

2009; Arthington et al., 2006). Conservation mechanisms have been recently implemented in 

Brazil. There are at least 20 Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) programs in operation in 

Brazil (Richards et al., 2015; Pagiola, von Glehn, &amp;amp; Taffarello, 2013), most of them focusing 

on hydrological services, e.g., improving water quality (by filtering pollutants and/or reducing 

sediments) and regulating flow discharge, in the Atlantic Forest biome. 

The watersheds in the Atlantic Forest are a rich source of available water in Brazil. 

This biome has an estimated 8000 endemic plants species and over 650 endemic vertebrates 

(Mittermeier et al., 2004) across 1.43 million km2 (Buckley &amp;amp; Pegas, 2014). The headwaters 

of these watersheds supply   the   drinking   water   to   more   than   a   half   of   the   Brazil’s   population   - 

122 million people (Rodrigues, Brancalion, &amp;amp; Isernhagen, 2009) - and produce 62% of 

Brazilian electricity (Joly, Metzger, &amp;amp; Tabarelli, 2014). The Brazilian Atlantic Forest has 

been protected by law since 2006, but less than 7% of its original coverage remains, which, 

added to secondary forests and fragments of less than 100 ha, results in 11.4% - 16% of cover 

(Ribeiro, Metzger, Martensen, Ponzoni &amp;amp; Hirota, 2009). The fragmentation has led to some 

regions   of   this   forest’s   biodiversity   being very threatened. One of them is the part of the 

Mantiqueira Mountains where the Cantareira Water Supply System (hereafter referred as the 

Cantareira System), the area of our study, is located. Despite the legal protection, more than 

73% of protected areas in the Cantareira System are under anthropic occupations (Whately &amp;amp; 

Cunha, 2007). Social and economic conflicts have arisen among the different water users. 

Conservation programmes are necessary not only for water and biodiversity (Joly et al., 

2014), but are also for the restoration of this unique biome (Rodrigues et al., 2009; Banks-

Leite et al., 2014).  

A pioneering Brazilian example of payment for watershed services is the Water 

Producer/PCJ (Produtor de Água/Piracicaba, Capivari and Jundiaí) project. This PES project 

has been encouraging forest restoration and conservation, as well as soil conservation, in rural 

private properties since 2009. As of mid-2015, 320 ha of forests was conserved, 68 ha of 

protected areas was restored and 100 ha of soils was conserved through more than 40 

contracts signed in the Cancan and Moinho watersheds, representing 5% of the total basin 

areas. The resources for the PES are provided by charges for the use of water resources 

(Taffarello, Calijuri, Viani, Marengo, &amp;amp; Mendiondo, 2015), instead of fees (since the charge 

for water use in Brazil is set as a public price). This procedure reflects the direct application 



70 
 

 
  

of   the   ‘user-pays   principle’   and   the ‘provider-recipient concept’ and its negative and positive 

externalities, respectively. 

The Water Producer/PCJ project began hydrological monitoring in 2013 through a 

partnership with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), governmental secretaries and 

universities. This monitoring will potentially attract new investments on account of greater 

confidence in the project (Naeem et al., 2015). But some water security questions related to 

the Water Producer PCJ project still remain, such as: (1) are the actions of PES programmes 

enough to improve and maintain water quality in critical headwaters?; and (2) how could 

discharge measurements in the field help optimize novel monitoring &amp;amp; early-warning 

hydrologic cycle strategies? 

4.1.3 The 2013-14 drought in South-East Brazil 

Water security is intrinsically related to the adaptive capacity of a society with respect 

to water extremes, especially in anticipating periods of water scarcity and droughts. However, 

drought prediction models are still highly conditioned to the inherent uncertainty of observed 

variables and methods of estimation (Underwood, 2015). In addition, non-stationary 

conditions of existing temperature and rainfall records incorporate new challenges to water 

systems under risks (Borgomeo et al., 2014).  

Trends in South American total rainfall and rainfall extremes and links with sea 

surface temperature were assessed for the period 1960-2000 by Haylock et al. (2006). 

Likewise, the IPCC AR5 WG2 (Magrin et al., 2014) showed that South America is vulnerable 

to climate change. Phillips et al. (2009) reported the loss of above-ground biomass carbon as a 

relevant impact of the severe 2005 drought that occurred in the Amazon forest. Changes in the 

frequency, intensity, spatial extent or duration of weather and climate extremes can result in 

extremes of river regimes (De Araújo et al., 2004). Thus, new drought index or methods were 

proposed by some authors (De Araújo &amp;amp; Bronstert, 2016; Cook et al., 2015; González &amp;amp; 

Valdés, 2006) for assessing hydrological droughts.  

In 2013-14, South-East Brazil faced the most intense drought recorded (Escobar, 

2015; Porto &amp;amp; Porto, 2014). Moreover, this effect remains to date (The Economist, 2015). 

Compared to historical records in South-East Brazil, the Brazilian Meteorology Institute 

showed that the precipitation in January-March 2014 was approximately 54% (300 mm) 

lower than the mean values of the 1961-1990 reference period (National Centre of Monitoring 

&amp;amp; Early Warning of Natural Disasters [CEMADEN], 2015). Satellite images from the Center 

for   Weather   Forecasts   and   Climate   Research   of   Brazil’s   National   Space   Research   Institute

(CPTEC/INPE) show that during January and February of 2014 continental vapour clouds 

from the Amazon failed to carry rain conditions to South-East Brazil.  

On the one hand, this 2013-14 drought jeopardized the 2015 public supply water 

allocations (Escobar, 2015). Besides the impact on 80 million people in Minas Gerais, Sao 

Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the Tiete waterway was disabled during the Brazilian rainy season 

in 2014, resulting in the loss of 5,000 jobs and millions of tonnes of un-transported products 

(Tundisi &amp;amp; Tundisi, 2015), which shows that the multiple uses of water were affected by this 

severe drought. On the other hand, water withdrawals from reservoirs with very low levels 

(Coutinho et al., 2015) also pose problems related to water quality, with the settled sediments, 

metals, microorganisms and macronutrient over-enrichment, mainly phosphorous (Carpenter, 

2005), which increase the water treatment costs. Some of the hydro-socio-economic impacts5 

of this drought were a 25% electricity price increase for 62% of Brazilians (Richards et al., 

2015), and an expansion of 150% in fire-prone areas, reducing the amount of vegetation cover 

in Sao Paulo state. Furthermore, many tourism establishments near reservoirs closed, and 

food prices increased significantly. In short, at least US$ 5 billion was lost in this 2013-14 

drought in South-East Brazil, which was the fifth most expensive natural disaster worldwide 

in 2014 (Munich RE, personal communication, February 02, 2016). 

To reduce the impacts of extreme events, such as severe droughts, hydrologic 

monitoring is needed, integrating meteorological and quali-quantitative variables of 

freshwater, especially in critical areas. Gordon et al. (2008) reported that small areas with 

high soil phosphorous concentrations and high runoff potential were responsible for most of 

the phosphorus runoff into freshwater. Thus, better water quality could be achieved by 

managing these critical areas rather than the entire catchment. Moreover, integrating water 

quality and water quantity can substantially improve our comprehension of how headwaters 

contribute with nutrient loads to downstream areas, which were responsible for the water 

supply to 15 million people. Nutrient transportation across scales can increase the trophic 

state of the reservoirs and also compromises the multiple uses (as a result of algal blooms and 

anoxic events). Especially under extreme events, the empirical relationships between the 

LULC and quali-quantity freshwater fluxes at headwater scales allow foreseeing water 

                                                 

 
5‘Hydro-socio-economic  impacts’ expresses the negative effects on socio -environment and economy brought by 
the 2013-14 drought which persisted in South -East Brazil. It was the worst water supply crisis in the Cantareira 
Water Supply System compared to the historical data (Marengo et al., 2015).  This term was adapted from the 
‘hydrosocial  territories’  concept  proposed  by  Boelens, Hoogesteger, Swyngedouw, Vos &amp;amp; Wester (2016).

scarcity at downstream scales. Evident correlations between LULC and water yield, as well as 

the respective effects on water quality at headwaters, allow preventing water shortages in 

downstream areas. The main objective of this study is to evaluate freshwater quali-

quantitative monitoring during the Sao Paulo 2013-14 drought at defined spatiotemporal 

scales. Thus, the characterization of nutrient loads related to drainage areas was investigated, 

as well as water yields in relation to forest cover in nested catchments. The goal is to integrate 

short-term evidences, as the on-field baseline, to boost long-term monitoring at strategic 

headwaters for water supply and environmental conservation. 

4.2 Material and Methods 

4.2.1 Study area 

Located in South-East Brazil, the Cantareira System, a 2300-km2 catchment drainage 

area connected to the 1,000 hm3of reservoirs and with total water demand of 36 m3/s (Water 

National Agency and Sao Paulo State Water and Energy Resource Management Agency 

[ANA/DAEE], 2013), was affected by the 2013-2014 drought. Because the Cantareira System 

has a mean residence time of approximately 1 year (CEMADEN, 2015), it failed to fully meet 

not only 45% of water demand of the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Region (SPMR) of 9 million 

inhabitants (responsible for 20% of Brazilian economy), but also downstream demands of the 

Campinas Metropolitan Region, of approximately 5 million inhabitants. Therefore, strategies 

for reducing water consumption are crucial. The headwaters of the Cantareira System drain 

into the Piracicaba River, a tributary of the Tietê River, in the left portion of the Parana Basin. 

Figure 4.1 shows the sampling points selected for water quality campaigns in 2013-14 among 

other catchment outlets, automatically generated from digital elevation modelling (DEM-

ASTER), with upstream drainage area above the thresholds of 0.60 km , for the Cachoeira 

and Atibainha subbasins, and above 0.75 km2 for the Jaguari and Jacarei subbasins. The 

Cantareira System is considered a strategic transboundary water system (Ditt et al., 2010). 

Considering the economic and demographic pressures on a megacity, to prevent water 

scarcity as a result of the unplanned growth of Sao Paulo Metropolitan Region, the 

government began constructing the system in the 1960s (Braga, 2001). As a great example of 

grey infrastructure, the connection of freshwater reservoirs was built in two steps. The first 

ended in 1975, and the second in 1981 (ANA, 2006). Its headwaters form three main river 

basins, the Jaguari-Jacareí, Cachoeira and Atibainha, with drainage areas within Cantareira 

System of 1230, 392, and 315 km2, respectively (Whately &amp;amp; Cunha, 2007).

headwaters of the Cantareira Water Supply System. 

 

According   to   Köppen’s   climate   classification,   the   local   climate   is   the   Cwb-type, high-

altitude subtropical climate, with dry winters and regular summers. The region of the PCJ has 

four major geological domains: the crystalline foundation, sedimentary rocks, the effusive 



74 
 

 
  

rocks and the sedimentary covers. Geological fractures encompass mainly NE-SW directions. 

But the Jaguari River is constrained by an average geologic fracture in the E-W direction. 

These features contribute to the erosion process by increasing the gap between the drains and 

the top of the slopes, facilitating the occurrence of landslides by sheet erosion (Piracicaba, 

Capivari and Jundiaí River Basin Committes [PCJ], 2011). 

The topography of the region is dominated by the moderate-to-high slopes from the 

Mantiqueira Mountains, with elevated valleys at altitudes between 800 and 2054 m.a.s.l. The 

headwaters of the Cantareira System (Figure 4.1) are located between coordinates 46o30’W, 
22o35’S  and  45o50’W, 23o05’S,  in  the  states of Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo. The vegetation is 

composed of remnants of the Atlantic Rainforest Biome, mentioned earlier, with mean annual 

precipitation of 1620-1737 mm (adapted from ANA/DAEE, 2013). Between October 2013 

and May 2014 this region was characterized by wet summers, and the average precipitation 

was 870 mm (CEMADEN, 2015) in the city of Extrema (MG), the geographic center of 

Jaguari-Jacareí, which is the largest basin of the Cantareira System, where the PES has been 

established for a decade. Comparing the three river basins, more gauge stations were found in 

the Jaguari-Jacareí sub-basin, which could be a consequence of the favourable institutional 

context of Extrema (Richards et al., 2015). 

In terms of pedology, there are associations of soils with humic-alic and dystrophic 

red-yellow oxisols (red yellow latosol) with A-horizons, with a high percentage of clay at 

moderate-to-higher slopes. The soil classes identified by Oliveira et al. (2012) in the Salto 

catchment (Extrema municipality, MG) are orthents, fluvents, inceptisols and red-yellow 

oxisols (Brazilian Corporation of Agricultural Research [EMBRAPA], 2006). The 

compactness coefficient of the soil of the region indicates, under normal rain conditions, the 

tendency for large floods.  

Past LULC changes are reported based on the Instituto Socioambiental [ISA] surveys 

conducted in 1989, 1999, 2003 and 2010. The LULC conversion from 1989 to 2010 can be 

summarized as follows. Dispersed urban settlements remained with the same land-use cover, 

early/middle stages of secondary vegetation increased from 4.6% to 7.4%, and livestock areas 

dropped from 58.8% to 46.2%; otherwise, reforestation increased from 19.6% to 

approximately 30%, and advanced secondary succession or primary vegetation remained the 

same, which was of approximately 15.4% (ISA, 2011). 

Resolution Nº. 357/2005 of the Brazilian National Environmental Council – 

CONAMA (Brazil,   2005)   classifies   as   freshwater   “Class   1”   the   protection   of   aquatic  



75 
 

 

communities, according to the water quality necessary for the main uses, and which after 

simplified treatment, can be directed to the public supply and other uses. Also, the Sao Paulo 

decree Nº 8486/1976   (Sao   Paulo,   1976)   considers  as  “Class  1”  the  water  for  domestic  supply  

without previous treatment or with only with simple disinfection.  The Sao Paulo State Decree 

Nº 10755/1977   classified   as   “Class   1”:   (1)   the   Atibainha   and   Cachoeira   rivers   and   all   their  

tributaries upstream of the respective Cantareira System reservoirs; and (2) the Jaguari river 

and all its tributaries upstream of the confluence with the Jacareí river at the municipality of 

Bragança Paulista (SP). 

4.2.2 Nested Catchment Experiment 

Exploratory nested catchment experiment (NCE) field campaigns identified river 

cross-sections of the highest interest for future installation of gauging stations. Based on 

LULC, hydrologic monitoring points were chosen at the main tributaries of Jaguari-Jacarei, 

Cachoeira and Atibainha using a Nested Catchment Experiment (NCE) methodology (Figure 

4.1, Table 4.1). NCE helps to understand the hydrologic process (McDonnell et al., 2007) and 
to define the hydrologic controls on non-point pollution transport (Scanlon et al., 2004). 

Exploratory NCE field campaigns to identify river cross-sections for future installation of 

gauging stations and systematic NCE field campaigns addressed both qualitative and 

quantitative river measurements. We performed two exploratory field campaigns to identify 

and select sampling sites, considering: (1) the scales in which changes in land use had a 

sufficient footprint to yield impacts within a short time frame; (2) the comparison between 

paired watersheds, i.e., reference versus intervention ones; and (3) safety and accessibility 

conditions. Accordingly, we planned four systematic campaigns (Table 4.1) following 

seasonal patterns and according to WMO (2010) guidelines to verify whether there are 

discrepancies between different seasons and to show the seasonal behaviour of quali-

quantitative river flow variables.  

Despite the distance between the sampling sites, they are in the same river basin 

(Piracicaba River). Moreover, they are at the same latitude (between -23.2º and -22.8º), and 

thus subjected to the same climatic conditions.

Note.    N = Number of samples of river cross-sections. P = total rainfall during NCE.  API = 
antecedent precipitation index of 15 days before NCE. Tair = mean and range of air 
temperature during field NCE. Twat er: mean and range of water temperature during field NCE. 

 

In all campaigns, the antecedent precipitation index of 15 days (API-15d) was 

calculated using data from the Sao Paulo State Water and Energy Resource Management 

Agency (DAEE, 2014). The 17 NCE sites indirectly receive non-point pollution from urban 

areas of Itapeva-MG, Camanducaia-MG, Extrema-MG, Joanópolis-SP and Nazaré Paulista-

SP cities, with a total population of 76,251 inhabitants (Brazilian Institute for Geography and 

Statistics [IBGE], 2014), and an average population growth of +2.2 %/y. 

Of these six field campaigns, the highest API-15d (123.7 mm) was in December 2013. 

Considering only systematic NCE campaigns, the minimum API (32.5mm) was in May 2014. 

Mean air daily temperature during field campaigns varied from 15.5 to 21.8 ºC, but with 

temperature intervals between daily minima and daily maxima ranging from 13.4 to 27.8 ºC 

(Figure 4.2).  

Because these campaigns were carried out in October/2013, December/2013, 

January/2014 and May/2014, water and air temperatures are expected to change. When 

rainfall was lower, air and water temperatures were different due to lower evaporation. 

Instead, due to higher evaporation the air and water temperature values are closer because of 

precipitation. The API-15d showed the behaviour expected for each campaign month, despite 

its absolute magnitude within a drought year.

maximum temperatures, during the nested catchments experiments. 

 

4.2.3 Water quantity monitoring 

A calibrated current meter and rotation counter were used for the discharge 

measurements. A metal wading rod was used to measure shallow-depth waters; for deeper 

cross-sections, a propeller current meter with rotation counter installed on an aluminium boat 

fixed to a meter-graduated steel wire was used (WMO, 2010). For all measurements, 

instantaneous velocities were sampled to assess the mean cross-sectional velocity and flow 

discharge. On average, all river cross-sections were sampled with observed velocity profiles 

separated by a distance of approximately 25 cm from each other; this strategy assured 

assessing the representative mean velocity at the cross-sections. Sampled observations were 

double-checked, either in the field or in the lab. Flow-discharge observations followed the 

WMO (2010). In addition, graduated river stages were installed with topographic references 

related to mean sea level. 

4.2.4 Water quality monitoring 

For an overview of the contributing watersheds and to help understand runoff 

processes, a general water quality characterization was performed to demonstrate the situation 

of the river during the experiments. This procedure is meant to improve the development of 



78 
 

 
  

water resources management policies and to calibrate a predictive model through the 

measurement of some parameters co-located with discharge gauging, since the loadings 

estimates are a requirement for the study objectives. 

Thus, at all 17 river cross-sections we analysed instantaneous water quality variables 

of hydrogenionic potential (pH), water temperature, electrical conductivity, turbidity, 

Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), total solids (TS), 

NO3, NO2, PO4, thermotolerant coliforms and Escherichia coli. The observed variables were 

analyzed following the American Public Health Association [APHA] (Rice, Baird, Eaton, &amp;amp; 

Clesceri, 2012).  The pH was estimated in the lab through APHA 40500   H+-B   Electrometric  

method,   electrical   conductivity   (EC,   in   µmho/cmunits)   was   performed   with   APHA   2510   B,  

and   turbidity   (in   NTU   units)   using   the  APHA   2130   B   method.   In   turn,   the   COD   (in   mgO2/L)  

and   the   BOD   (inmgO2/L)   were   estimated   through,   respectively,   APHA   5220 D–colorimetric 

and 5210 B – 5-day BOD Test methods. TS (in mg/L) were assessed by APHA 2540B 

method. 

Regarding Nitrogen and Phosphorus loads, Total Nitrogen  was evaluated through 

APHA 4500 NB (Macro Kjeldahl), N-NO3 (nitrate,in   mg/L)  by APHA 4500 NO3—B 

(Spectrophotometric Method), N-NO2 (nitrite, in   mg/L) through APHA 4500 NO2-B 

(colorimetric method), N-NH3 (ammonia,in   mg/L) through 4500 NH3-C, and P-PO4 

(phosphate, in   mg/L) through APHA-4500 P-E (ascorbic acid). Finally, thermotolerant 

coliforms (colony-forming units, CFU/100 mL) and E. coli (CFU/100 mL) were evaluated 

using APHA 9223B (substrate enzyme test). In the depuration process of water bodies, 

freshwater monitoring is fundamental to understand pollutant concentration changes 

throughout the year in line with the seasons (Bottino et al., 2010).  

 

4.3 Results 

4.3.1 Land-use and land-cover change at experimental catchments 

Table 4.2 shows four systematic field campaigns at river cross-sections using NCE. It 

also shows the respective recorded land-use and land-cover (LULC) data for the areas, 

upslope of NCE river cross-section, at Cantareira System headwaters. Table 4.2 shows the 
features of sampled NCE sites. All 17 experimental sites have average river bed slopes 

ranging from 0.24% to 1.18%, with sinuosity &gt;1.2, entrenchment ratios of cross-sections &gt; 



79 
 

 

1.4, with transitional sandy-gravel bedslopes, and width-to-depth ratios from 1.5 to over 4.8 

(Rosgen &amp;amp; Silvey, 1998).  

The main LULC in the river basins was classified in three main mixing uses and 

cover: sparse human settlement and/or urban areas (Settl.), open mixed areas for cattle and 

range (Range), and mixed natural forests, and/or riparian forests and/or reforestation (Forest). 

Riparian vegetation is densely occupied by a mixture of endemic hydromorphic species, co-

existing with many exotic species, such as Eucalyptus sp. and Bambusoideae sp. The 

monitoring points (Table 4.2) were located at the headwaters of the main tributaries of 
Cantareira System reservoirs - three at Atibainha Basin (ATI), seven at Cachoeira Basin 

(CAC) and seven at Jaguari Basin (JAG). 

Table 2 also shows two columns to the right: the forest LULC growth between 1989 

and 2010 and the rate class called LULC. In summary, the table shows an average LULC 

forest growth in spatial extent of 42.7% between 1989 and 2010. The last column is composed 

of five fields. The first three fields show the categorical growth of the three main LULC, in 

the period 1989-2010, for settlement, range and forest, respectively. The fourth field of this 

code   represents   the   Horton’s   geomorphological   order   at   the   NCE;? “†”means that the 

experimental NCE drains directly into the reservoir, and is not connected to the main stem of 

the river tributary.   The   fifth   (last)   field   represents   whether   Horton’s   order   at   the   NCE   point   is  

equal   to   (“=”)   or   higher   than   (“&gt;”)   Horton’s   order   of   the   upstream   NCE,   when   there   is   an  

upstream   NCE.   In   that   fifth   field,   symbol   “‡”means that incremental area, upstream of the 

NCE point, equals the total drainage area (there is no upstream NCE).  

For example, for site Nº 16 (Reference Moinho in Table 4.2),   the   code   ‘0/±/1/‡’  

means a field evidence collected at a NCE river cross-section with an adjacent draining area 

with no-change   (0%)   in   LULC   human   settlement,   with   positive   (“+”)   growth   of   LULC   range  

areas and,   likewise,   with   negative   (“-”) growth of LULC forest areas. Furthermore, the last 

column of Table 4.2 is underlined when the catchment has positive LULC forest. 

Nine (9) river cross-sections were characterized with LULC of the adjacent area 

equalled   to   the   total   drainage   area   (depicted   with   symbol   “‡”,   Table 4.2). The other eight (8) 
river cross sections have LULC related to the upslope incremental catchment, between two 

sampling points. According to digital elevation modelling, six river cross sections were 

surveyed  as  Horton’s  1st-order basins, three as 2nd-order, one as 3rd-order, five as 4t h-order and 

two as 5t h-order.   Horton’s   1st-order drainage areas ranged from 0.66 to 11.9 km2, and also 

Horton’s   5t h-order which ranged from 289 to 925 km2.

Regionalized similarities among nested catchment experiments were the result of 

inter-related factors. Observed seasonal water yield of catchments ranged between 5% and 

18% of accumulated precipitation for the period of October 2013 to May 2014, thereby 

differentiating two catchment groups (Figure 4.3 and Figure 4.4).  On the one hand, some 

catchments had higher water yields: the Cancan-Intervention catchment (A=2.01km2, with 

water yield of 146 mm), the three main sub-basins together draining into the reservoirs 

(A=1940 km2, water yield of 151mm) and the JAG System (A=1234km2, with water yield of 

141mm), with authorized water withdrawal of 13mm/year (ANA/DAEE, 2014).  

On the other hand, three other catchments had lower water yields: the Cancan-

Reference catchment (A=1.26km2, with water yield of 74mm), CAC system (A=393km2, with 

forest land use cover of 60%, water yield of 59 mm) and ATI system (A=313km2, with forest 

land use cover of 71% (Pereira &amp;amp;Teixeira Filho, 2009), water yield of 41mm). In general, 

Figure 4.4 shows that the experimental results had an inverse relationship between water yield 
and forestry cover in the catchment areas.

4.3.2 Water quantity and quality monitoring 

Appendix-B summarizes all quali-quantitative results from our episodic freshwater 

monitoring in the headwaters of Cantareira System. Part of these data was used as input and 

for calibration of the ecohydrologic model performed in scenarios simulations (see Chapter 5 

of this thesis).  

The median sampled pH was 6.9, with a sample mean of 6.9±0.2. Median electrical 

conductivity (EC) for all sampled data was 41.0 µmho/cm (42.0 r 21.6 µS/cm), ranging 

between a minimum of 13.0 µS/cm and a maximum of 133.9 µS/cm. The former minimum 

value was related to highly-oxygenated headwaters, i.e., Cachoeira dos Pretos, with a 

drainage area of 101.4 km2, during the rainy periods in December 2013. Conversely, the 

lowest electrical conductivity was seen at Posses Outlet, with drainage area of 11.9 km2, with 

significant interference of farm-to-urban conversion, which influenced the river water quality. 



83 
 

 

The median BOD was 2.0 mgO2/L, with means of 2.4 r1.8 mgO2/L, and a narrow range 

between 1.0 to 6.0 mgO2/L. Factors such as turbulence, metal toxicity, organic compounds 

and nitrogen can influence BOD results.  

Figure 4.5 summarizes the observed water quality variables for the period October 

2013 to May 2014 at tributaries of the Jaguari, Cachoeira and Atibainha sub-basins. For 

example, median COD was 16.0 mgO2/L, with a mean of 19.0 mg O2/L, and a maximum of 

98.0 mg O2/L for the Atibainha sub-basin (drainage area of 1,642 km2).  

For all experiment surveys, the median TS was 45 mg/L, with a maximum of 305 

mg/L at Parque de Eventos, with drainage area of 925 km2, and an estimated TS load of 215 

t/km2 per year.  

In terms of total coliforms, the median value was of 65,000 colony-forming units 

(CFU/100 mL), with high variability. For example, the total range of thermotolerant coliforms 

ranged between 14.0 (Cachoeira Outlet, 289 km2) and 9.6u105 CFU/100mL (Parque de 

Eventos, drainage area of 925 km2). The sampled water data show that no cluster from flow 

discharges versus water quality concentration can be inferred. For example, in Figure 4.5, 

only two intervals of observed flow discharges were surveyed during the field campaigns, i.e., 

0.06  ?  Q ?  0.14  and  0.8  ?  Q ?  20.1  m3/s.

4.3.3 Variability of P-PO4 loads 

P-PO4 concentrations have a median value of 0.12 mg/L, with high variability (0.16 r 

0.20 mg/L), with total range between a minimum of 0.02 mg/.L (Cachoeira dos Pretos, 

drainage area of 101.4 km2) and a maximum of 1.62 mg/L (Parque de Eventos – Extrema, 

drainage area of 925 km2).  

An empirical relationship (Table 4.3) of PO4-3 load (kg/day) was obtained for all field 

campaigns, with R2=83%. The lower specific phosphate load, the pollutant load per drainage 

area, was found for site 9 (Domithildes, Reference Cancan area), in Figure 4.1, with 0.027 kg 

P-PO4-3/ha per year, and the highest load was for site 7 (Jaguari, Parque de Eventos), in 

Figure 4.1, with 2.397 P-PO4-3 /ha per year. 
Figure 4.6 shows that there is not enough evidence to regionalize empirical P-PO4-3 

concentration and flow discharges. Otherwise, when PO 4-3 load was related to the drainage 

area (Figure 4.7), seasonal NCE observations were better grouped.

4.3.4 Variability of N-NO3 loads 

Figure 4.5 shows that the loads found for nitrate were higher than for phosphate at the 

three sub-basins (JAG, CAC and ATI) in all field investigations. Figure 4.8 shows there is 
not enough evidence to regionalize empirical N-NO3-2 concentration and flow discharges. 

However, for nitrate, the highest load was found in May/2014 (Figure 4.9). The median 
concentration of nitrate in May/2014 was 1.68mg/L. This result was 14 times as high as the 

N-NO3 concentration in October 2013, 10 times that found in December 2013 and 6 times 

than that found in March 2014.

Considering both phosphate and nitrate loads, based on Figures 4.7 and 4.9, equations 

were developed to find the expected load for phosphate and nitrate corresponding to each 

drainage area from the 17 experimental sites (Table 4.3). Among them, the findings for 

nitrate are highlighted, where R2 between 94% and 95% was achieved in most of the seasonal 

assessments. 

 

4.4. Discussion 

Discussion of the results from the field campaigns is presented in the following 

paragraphs. Also discussed are the effects of some water pollutants, the water quantity and 

quality impacts, and water challenges. 

4.4.1. Water quantity &amp;amp; quality monitoring 

In each of the campaigns described in Table 4.1, quality and quantity evaluations were 
performed at 17 sites. The main differences in the results were related to uncontrolled 

patterns, such as precipitation occurrence among field campaigns. The greatest difference is 

related to the fourth field campaign, showing lower API (32.5 mm, which represents 33.4% of 

the mean API) resulting from the more intense drought conditions. The findings are 



88 
 

 
  

comparable because (1) the sample sites were at the same river basin and at the same latitude, 

and thus subjected to the same climatic conditions; (2) they resulted from rainfall-runoff 

transformation effects; and (3) the state of the land-use cover within the experimental 

catchments.  

LULC changes are relevant factors that impact quality, quantity and seasonal aspects 

of water resources. Concerning water quantity, the results showed an inverse relationship 

between water yield and forest cover in the catchments (Figure 4.4), which confirms previous 

studies (Germer et al., 2009; Pereira &amp;amp; Teixeira Filho, 2009). However, Ellison, Futter &amp;amp; 

Bishop (2012) highlighted that more forested catchment reducing water availability and 

precipitation can be easily notable at local scales. Small catchments can receive precipitation 

from other areas. Thus, the consequence of deforestation, less evapotranspiration and less 

precipitation can be clearly seen at larger spatial scales. At regional scales, forest–water 

relationships play a key role in providing the atmospheric vapour that becomes precipitation. 

In short, forest cover and its impact on water yield depend on the catchment scale; thus, this 

issue should be placed under scrutiny. Thus, we recommend caution with regard to 

generalizing our results because they were sampled during a rainfall anomaly season (see 

Marengo et al., 2015). 

The presented procedure, which integrates water quality, quantity and meteorological 

variables, provides some contributions for preventing repetition of the 2013-14 drought. First, 

we developed an integrated monitoring network at different spatial scales, and, using 

meteorological, qualitative and quantitative freshwater variables, an additional early-warning 

system was addressed. Previous to this drought, the integration of qualitative and quantitative 

aspects of water resources seldom occurred in Cantareira headwaters. Second, this integrated 

monitoring helped the management capacity regarding the drought conditions. For example, 

the reaction of Brazilian water managers regarding drought evidences was water demand and 

availability control. On 5 March 2014, the Brazilian National Water Agency [ANA] and the 

Sao Paulo Department of Water and Electricity [DAEE] released the Resolution Nº 335 to 

regulate new patterns of water withdrawals from the Cantareira reservoirs of Jaguari-Jacareí, 

Cachoeira and Atibainha (ANA, 2016). Third, our field work in 2013-14 motivated a strategy 

change concerning the official monitoring system at the headwaters of Cantareira System. 

Before 2013 there were only seven online rain-gauge stations; after 2014 this number 

increased by a factor of six (see CEMADEN, Cantareira System Report, 2015). Furthermore, 

a significant increase in the number of online water-level stations, local water levels, 



89 
 

 

experimental V-notch weirs, and in situ quali-quantitative flow observations were installed 

after 2014. This shows a resilient strategy in-progress to cope with future risks in these 

strategic river basins to ecosystems and water supply.    

With regard to water quality, pollutant loads include a combination of natural and 

anthropogenic factors due to land use and land cover. Progressive changes in LULC can alter 

pollutant concentrations and behaviour, reducing biodiversity and increasing uncertainties. 

For example, Magurran (2016) and Newbold et al. (2015) reported that land use caused 

species richness loss (alpha-diversity loss) and its possible impacts on ecosystem functioning. 

Although we expected high field observations uncertainties in terms of water quantity 

and quality, we found evidence of regional behaviours of loads versus drainage areas (Figure 
4.7 for PO4-3 loads and Figure 4.9 for NO3 loads). Nevertheless, specific loads in kg per day 

per km2, for both PO4-3 and NO3, show low empirical correlations. Thus, specific-load curves 

per drainage area do not seem appropriate for these sampled data. 
The threat posed by sediments in the freshwater ecosystems has increased due to 

anthropogenic factors. TS deposition contributes towards turbidity, stress behaviour during 

the early stages of natural consolidation of soils deposited under water, and potential impacts 

from the synergisms between nutrients. We found maximum TS of 305 mg/L at Parque de 

Eventos - Extrema, with an estimated TS load of 215 t/km2 per year. In terms of TS, our most 

polluted site (among the 17 NCEs) appears to be 2.5 times less polluted than a basin in 

Australia. Bainbridge et al. (2014) reported 530 t/km2 per year in the Burdekin River 

catchment, a dry tropical catchment, in a five-year study period. Although it is a medium-

sized river catchment, the adjacent urban areas of Extrema have affected the river water 

quality. In 2014 Extrema had approximately 32,402 inhabitants (IBGE, 2014), with a 

population growth rate of 3.3 % per year. Other water quality variables also presented 

extreme values at the same field site.   

Thermotolerant coliforms ranged between 14.0 (Cachoeira Outlet, 289 km2) and 9.6 X 

105 CFU/100mL (Parque de Eventos, 925 km2). These results in medium-size drainage areas 

are related to impacts of two different conditions, one from urban loads and the other from 

auto-depuration processes in rural areas. Some authors (Lyon et al., 2012; Ouyang, Nkedi-

Kizza, Wu, Shinde &amp;amp; Huang, 2006) recommend special actions related to the inherent 

variations of real catchments in terms of their characterization. For example, Ouyang et al. 

(2006) reported that except for electrical conductivity, the most important parameter to 

provide water quality variation for one season was not important for another season.

4.4.2 Variability of P-PO4 loads 

The precipitation in December/2013 (Figure 4.3) may be responsible for the increase 

in the pollutant loads carried into the rivers, as was the case for phosphate. Considering the 

seasonal variability, the phosphate concentration was the highest in December 2013 (mean 

0.18 mg PO4-3/L) in most of the monitoring sites. However, PO4-3 concentration appears to 

have increased in the drainage area of the catchments under study (Figure 4.7). This 

behaviour is addressed by other authors (e.g. Scanlon et al., 2004), who point to the fact that 

PO4-3 load transfers increased from headwaters to downstream areas. However, PO 4-3 specific 

loads in the drainage area increased in a similar way.  

In experimental catchments with drainage areas between 66 and 310 ha, specific loads 

ranged from 8×10-4to 2.8 ×10-1 kg P-PO4-3 per km2 per day. These specific loads showed wide 

variability, and apparently related to a combination of factors like LULC, size of drainage 

area, antecedent moisture conditions and farm best management practices. On the one hand, 

lower specific P-PO4-3 loads at micro-catchments of Cancan and Moinho can be associated 

with the progressive decline of land use cover of native Atlantic rainforest. Additional small 

pools associated with medium forest cover of 53% (Intervention Moinho) also decreased 

specific P-PO4-3 loads. But when this forest cover dropped to 13%, specific P-PO4-3 loads 

increased (Intervention Cancan). These results may be associated with greater land use cover 

of native Atlantic rainforest, forming containment barriers and preventing the direct entry of 

surface runoff into streams. On the other hand, Site 7 (Jaguari-ParqueEventos, 925 km2), 

receiving urban loads from Extrema city, as well as agriculture and industrial wastewater, had 

the highest specific loads, of 7.9 kg P-PO4-3per km2 per day. Scanlon et al. (2004) found that 

neither topographic descriptor was found to satisfactorily conform to the concentration-

versus-discharge observations, thereby indicating that local catchment sediment delivery 

factors or in-stream channel processes are likely to be responsible for the observed 

differences. Although our observed discharge intervals had a gap of mean discharge 

measurement of 0.1 - 0.8 m3/s, there is still not enough evidence to accomplish a regionalized 

curve or behaviour in terms of P-PO4-3 concentration and discharges, as shown in Figure 4.6.  
 

4.4.3 Variability of N-NO3 loads 

Considering the increasingly dry conditions observed during the months of this study - 

which persisted and intensified until early 2015 (The Economist, 2015) -, the lower flows led 



91 
 

 

to higher concentrations of pollutants and affected the aquatic ecosystem overall. As a result, 

there was a death of 20 tonnes of different fish species in the Piracicaba River in February, 

2014 (Marengo et al., 2015). The higher nutrient load level is one of the most threatening 

factors for the biodiversity of native fish. This can be explained by the proliferation of 

microorganisms in dry conditions, which consume the remaining oxygen in the water.  

This study found that pollutant loads and drainage areas (0.66-925 km ) have different 

correlations. Nitrate is more closely related to drainage area than phosphate. Nitrate loads are 

higher than phosphate loads in all field/lab experiments and in all sub-basins. The equations 

related to the expected phosphate and nitrate loads corresponding to each drainage area 

(Table 4.3) led us to highlight our findings for nitrate, where R2 between 94% and 95% was 
achieved in most of the seasonal assessments. 

Around 95% of nitrate load variability can be explained by the size of the contribution 

or drainage area and vice-versa. The remaining 5% can be explained by other factors that 

were not measured, such as synergism between nitrate and other nutrients, deeper water 

layers, eutrophication, etc. Similar results were found for phosphate in December 2013. This 

very high correlation (95%) can help companies and the government to predict water 

pollution based on experimental data and improve the goals of the River Basin Plan, in a key 

research-for-action initiative. For the observations in Table 4.3, the empirical ratio of N-NO3 
to P-PO4 was very low, ranging from 1.5 (for A=1 km2) to 2.2 (for A= 1000km2).  

It is known that nitrogen is an essential macronutrient which regulates primary 

production in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Excess nitrogen has been linked to many 

environmental concerns, including the disruption of forest ecosystem functions, acidification 

of streams, eutrophication, hypoxia and algal blooms. These processes may be some of the 

impacts of recent climate change.  

Since nitrogen is highly reactive and mobile in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, it 

also serves as a surrogate for many contaminants in the water, which is important in 

understanding the linkages between headwaters and downstream receiving waters.  

 

4.5 Conclusions 

The objective of this chapter was to integrate short-term evidence, as the on-field 

baseline, to stimulate long-term monitoring at strategic headwaters constrained by 

hydrological extremes. Using evidence from 17 sites through nested catchment experiments 



92 
 

 
  

during field surveys in the 2013-14 period, characterized by a low-precipitation anomaly in 

South-East Brazil, the importance is highlighted of an integrated quali-quantitative freshwater 

monitoring in the Cantareira System, one of the main water supply systems in South-East 

Brazil. The study findings indicate that: (1) for water quantity, catchments with less forest 

cover present higher water yields, suggesting a possible inverse correlation between forest 

cover and water yield; (2) for water quality, empirical evidence of loads (phosphate and 

nitrate) versus drainage area, as regionalization procedures for rating curves, presented better 

relationships than water quality concentration versus flow discharges; (3) from this 

regionalization, 95% of total variance of phosphate and nitrate loads was explained using 

drainage areas as independent variables; and (4) this nutrient migration from headwaters to 

downstream areas could have impacts of load accumulation and eutrophication in water 

supply reservoirs.  

Based on these experimental data, the results could assist decision-making, regarding 

actual and new water rights permits for industrial, domestic, farming, energy supply users and 

the environmental needs. A good example of how this procedure can contribute to avoid the 

aggravation of the water crisis is the Joint Resolution ANA/DAEE Nº 335 of 5 March 2014, 

which reviewed the operation standards of the three reservoirs, which are downstream of the 

17 campaign sites, where the discharge was measured. This reinforces data quality and 

density, making decision-making more robust. 

The 2013-14 drought in South-East Brazil is a recent example of the urgent need for 

enhanced integrated monitoring of water quality and quantity as part of a robust strategy for 

achieving water security. Given the impacts of the Sao Paulo water crisis, there is an 

increasing concern over vulnerabilities and impacts on quality, quantity and seasonal aspects 

of water resources. Thus, environmental conservation programmes are a possible adaptation 

strategy, by converting land use to environmentally-friendly land cover. This research has the 

potential to be applied to other relevant regions in South America which are also facing recent 

extreme events, since freshwater monitoring brings an interesting set of primary data. 

Through new and reliable knowledge this study has the potential to improve the River Basin 

Plan goals, in a key research-for-action initiative. Moreover, the partnership between 

universities, NGOs, and federal, regional and local governmental agencies was (and is) 

fundamental to stimulate freshwater monitoring, in not only qualitative, but also quantitative 

terms, and assess the protection of watersheds. 



93 
 

 

Further research is needed for continuing and expanding long-term monitoring and 

early-warning strategies in critical watersheds, dependent upon the role played by long-term 

climate change and its influence on ecosystem services. Finally, we suggest updating the 

Brazilian water quality standards according to more restrictive frameworks for actual water 

security.

Abstract 

Freshwater fluxes are influenced by the volume and quality of water at the headwaters of 
strategic river basins under change. Although hydrological models provide hypothesis testing 
of complex dynamics occurring at river basin scales, freshwater quality modeling is still 
incipient at many river catchments. In Brazil, approximately only one in twenty modeling 
studies assesses freshwater nutrients, which limit the policies regarding hydrological 
ecosystem services. This paper aims to compare freshwater quality scenarios under different 
land-use/land-cover (LULC) change, one of them related to Ecosystem-based Adaptation 
(EbA) approach in subtropical headwaters. Using the spatially semi-distributed SWAT (Soil 
and Water Assessment Tool) model, nitrate and total phosphorous loads were modeled in 
Brazilian subtropical catchments ranging from 7.2 to 1037 km2. Part of these catchments are 
eligible areas of the Brazilian PES-programmes Water Producer and Water Conservator in 
the Cantareira Water Supply System, which until the drought in 2013-15 supplied water to 9 
million people in the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Region. We considered freshwater quality 
modeling of three LULC scenarios, with no climate change, as: (i) recent past scenario (S1), 
with the historic LULC records in 1990, (ii) current land use scenario (S2), considered the 
LULC for the period 2010-2015 as the baseline, and (iii) future land use scenario (S2+EbA). 
The latter scenario proposed forest cover conversion with restoration through EbA in 
protected areas according to the Basin Plan of the Piracicaba-Capivari-Jundiaí watersheds by 
2035. The three LULC scenarios were tested with the same records of rainfall and 
evapotranspiration observations in 2006-2014, which comprised the occurrence of extreme 
drought events. We propose a new indicator for hydrologic services assessment related to the 
grey water footprint (greyWF) and water yield estimated. The Hydrologic Services Indicator 
(HSI), as a non-dimensional factor of comparing water pollution loads (WPL) for referenced 
and non-referenced catchment, composing water pollution levels from nitrate, total 
phosphorus and sediments. On the one hand, leaching simulations of nitrate and total 
phosphorous allowed the regionalization of greyWF at different spatial scales under LULC 
changes. According to critical threshold of reference catchments, HSI identified basins into 
less sustainable and more sustainable areas. On the other hand, conservation practices 
simulated through S2+EbA scenario envisaged not only additional, viable best management 
practices, but also preventive decision making at the headwaters of water supply systems.

5.1. Introduction 

The Basin Plan comprises the main management tool, the planning for sustainable use 

of water resources in both spatial and temporal scales. For sustainable water allocation, river 

plans are based on accurate data on actual water availability per basin, taking into account 

water   needs   for   humans;?   environmental   water   requirements   and   the   basin’s   ability   to  

assimilate pollution (Mekonnen et al., 2015). However, adaptive management options such as 

Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA; see CBD, 2010; BFN/GIZ, 2013) and water footprint 

(WF, Hoekstra &amp;amp; Chapagain, 2008) have rarely been incorporated in the Brazilian Basin 

Plans. Moreover, integrated quali-quantitative simulations and indicators of human 

appropriation of freshwater resources are seldom used in river plans. The WF as an 

environmental indicator in watershed plans was used in some countries like Spain (Velázquez 

et al., 2011; Aldaya et al., 2010). In Brazil, recent glossary of terms released by Brazilian 

National Water Agency (ANA, 2015) incorporates the WF concept to support water resources 

management.  

The WF (Mekonnen &amp;amp; Hoekstra, 2015; Hoekstra et al., 2011) measures both the direct 

and indirect water use within a river basin. The term water use refers to water withdrawal, as 

the consumptive use of rainwater (the green water footprint) and of surface/groundwater (the 

blue water footprint), and water pollution, i.e., the volume of water used to assimilate the 

pollutant loads (the grey water footprint, GWF, see Chapagain et al. 2006; Hoekstra &amp;amp; 

Chapagain, 2008; Hoekstra et al., 2011). In addition, the water footprint assessment, proposed 

by Hoekstra et al. (2011), encompasses four phases: (1) Setting goals, (2) Accounting, (3) 

Sustainability assessment, and (4) Response formulation. It is worth noting that WF studies 

can be restricted to one specific activity of these phases or be related to more than one phase. 

At the water footprint response formulation phase, the EbA options, represented by best 

management practices (BMP) at the catchment scale, could represent a trade-off on greyWF 

(Zaffani et al., 2011; see Chapter 2 of this thesis). The advantage of quantifying the effects of 

pollution by volume, instead by concentration, is that water pollution can be considered as a 

demand from non-consumptive water uses (Mekonnen &amp;amp; Hoekstra, 2015; Hoekstra &amp;amp; 

Mekonnen, 2012), in the same measure units, becoming water demand and availability 

comparable.  

In the context of integrated water resources management associated with land-

use/land-cover (LULC) change, many existing conflicts over water use could be prevented 

(Winemiller et al., 2016; Aldaya et al., 2010; Oki &amp;amp; Kanae, 2006). For example, LULC 



101 
 

 

influences water quality, which affects the supporting6 and regulating7 ecosystem services 

(Mulder et al., 2015; MEA, 2005) and needs to be monitored for adaptive and equitable 

management in the river basin scale (Taffarello et al., 2016; Chapter 4 of this thesis).  

In spite of discussions regard the lack of representativeness of data used in early 

studies with greyWF (Wichelns, 2015; Zhang et al., 2010; Aldaya et al., 2010; Aldaya &amp;amp; 

Llamas, 2008), we argue that the greyWF method may account hydrologic services and 

provide a multidisciplinary, qualitative-quantitative integrated and transparent framework for 

better water policy decisions. Understanding these catchment-scale ecohydrologic processes 

requires not only low-frequency sampling and automated, in situ, high-frequency monitoring 

(Viswanathan et al., 2015; Bieroza et al., 2014; Halliday et al., 2012), but also the use of 

ecohydrologic models to protect water quality and quantity.  However, freshwater quality 

modeling, associated with EbA, greyWF and LULC is still incipient in many river 

catchments. In Brazil, approximately only 5% of modeling studies evaluate nutrients into 

freshwater (Bressiani et al., 2015), which limit the policies on regulating ecosystem services. 

In this research, we propose the regulating ecosystem services be addressed by the 

greyWF because it considers the water volume for self-purification of receiving water bodies 

affected by pollutants (Zhang et al., 2010). Thus, the hypothesis of this research is: 

conservation practices, addressed by BMP or EbA, and other types of land use conversion 

which impact hydrology and the ecosystem services (Winemiller et al., 2016) in the 

catchment and sub-basin scales. In these scales, the greyWF can evaluate the changes in the 

regulating hydrologic services. Among the three water footprint components, in this study we 

assessed greyWF for nitrate, total phosphorous and sediments in 20 sub-basins in the 

headwaters of Cantareira Water Supply System. The goal of this study is to compare 

freshwater quality scenarios, one of them related to EbA options through BMP, and to assess 

GWF under different LULC changes. This method is addressed through Nested Catchment 

Experiments (NCE, see Taffarello et al., 2016a and 2016b, Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 of this 

thesis) at a range of scales, from small catchments of 7.7 km2 to medium-size basins of 1200 

km2 at subtropical headwaters responsible for the water supply of Sao Paulo Metropolitan 

Region (SPMR). This chapter consists of four sections. The first section provides a brief 

description of the context, gap, hypothesis and our research goals.  The second section

describes the simulation methods used in the watershed scale and development of three LULC 

scenarios. We then propose some ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) approaches related to 

water pollution. Finally, we discuss how the grey water footprint for nitrate or total 

phosphorous could be an EbA option for improving decision-making and water security in 

subtropical catchments under change.

5.2.1. The case-study area 

Two of the most vulnerable areas in the Brazilian South-East are the Tietê and 

Piracicaba-Capivari-Jundiaí (PCJ) watersheds, particularly due to its high population (14 

million inhabitants), In an attempt to ensure public water supply, the government built the 

Cantareira System, an inter-basin transfer, in two stages: a) between 1968 and 1974, at the 

end of a 35 year period that underwent a severe drought in the Piracicaba watershed, and b) in 
1982, with the inclusion of two additional reservoirs that regularized the increasing rainfall 

from mid-1970s until 2005 (Zuffo, 2015). 

The study area comprises the part of the Cantareira System that drains into the 

Piracicaba river and which is the headwater of the Piracicaba basin (Figure 5.1). This basin is 
located in the borderline of the state of Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo. The water supply system 

in the Piracicaba watershed consists of three main reservoirs which are provided with water 

from the Jaguari-Jacarei, Atibainha and Cachoeira watersheds. Their water is directed to three 

main reservoirs named after their water suppliers: the Jaguari-Jacarei, Cachoeira and 

Atibainha basins (drainage areas are, respectively, 1230 km , 392 km  and 312 km ). The 

Jaguari, Cachoeira and Atibainha rivers are the main tributaries of the Piracicaba River Basin, 

which are tributaries of the Tiete River system, left affluent of the Parana Basin. The 

Cantareira System consists of two more reservoirs, located closer to the Metropolitan Region 

of São Paulo: Paiva Castro and Águas Claras. These two reservoirs are not part of our study 

area. To simplify our simulations, we did not model the flow to the dams (we did not include 

the dams and the complex water transfers). The water from these five reservoirs is crucial for 

the   water   supply   to   South   America’s   biggest   city,   Sao   Paulo,   as   well   as   the   Metropolitan  

Region of Campinas.

watersheds. 

 

With respect to the water quality, the headwaters of the Cantareira System are 

classified   as   “class   1”   for   Jacareí,   Cachoeira   and   Atibainha   watersheds,   and   “class   2”   for   the  

Jaguari watershed, according to CONAMA Resolution Nº 357/2005 (Brazil, 2005) and Sao 

Paulo Decree Nº 8468/1976 (Sao Paulo, 1976), which means that, with the exception of the 

Jaguari watershed, the others can be used without previous treatment. And regarding the water 

volume, this region has been intensely impacted by a severe and recent drought (Taffarello et 

al., 2016; Escobar, 2015; Whately &amp;amp; Lerer, 2015; ANA, 2015; Porto &amp;amp; Porto, 2014). As a 

result of this serious water crisis, the new ruling on the average flow of the transfer limits of 

the Piracicaba watershed to the Upper Tiete watershed was postponed from 2014 to May 2017 

(ANA, 2015).  The Cantareira System is located in the Atlantic Forest biome, considered a 

conservation hotspot because of its rich biodiversity. In spite of that, 78% of the original 

forest cover of the Cantareira watershed has been deforested over the past 30 years (Zuffo, 

2015). In 2014, the native forest cover was 10% in Extrema, 12% in Joanópolis and 21% in 

Nazaré Paulista (SOS Mata Atlântica/INPE, 2015). To counteract deforestation, some 

environmental/financial trade-offs have been developed in the Cantareira headwaters for the 

protection of downstream water quality and the regulation of water flows. These are 



104 
 

 
  

Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) initiatives, in which rural landowners receive economic 

incentives to conserve and/or restore riparian forests and implement soil conservation 

practices (see Chapter 3 of this thesis). The first Brazilian EbA approach was the Water 

Conservator Project, created in 2005, implemented in Extrema, Minas Gerais (Richards et al., 

2015; Pereira, 2013). The Cantareira System also has, since 2009, the Water Producer/PCJ 

(Guimarães, 2013), a pioneer project in the state of Sao Paulo, which promotes: (i) forest 

restoration in permanent preservation areas (PPA); (ii) conservation of remaining forest 

fragments; and (iii) soil conservation. As a pilot project, it focuses on providing subsidies to 

larger scale projects (Padovezi et al., 2013). Both projects were established through public-

private partnerships, strengthening EbA in Brazil. 

 

5.2.2. Databases and model 

Figure 5.2 shows the spatial data used in this study, which schematizes a greyWF 

method which was developed and applied to assess the regulating hydrologic services.  The 

simulations were enhanced by model parameterization with qualitative and quantitative 

primary data (Mohor et al., 2015a; Mohor et al., 2015b; Taffarello et al. 2016b). This can 

reduce uncertainties of the model, facilitate data interpretation and provide consistent 

information. We conducted six field campaigns between 2012 and 2014, in partnership with 

ANA, CPRM, TNC-Brazil, WWF, USP/EESC, and municipalities. We have installed three 

data collection platforms (DCP) in catchments of Posses, Cancã and Moinho, and level and 

pressure sensors in paired sub-basins (i) with high original vegetation cover, and (ii) in basins 

that receive payment for ecosystem services due to participating in the Water Producer/PCJ 

project.  

Worldwide uses of environmental service models are increasing (Posner et al., 2016). 

Some examples of ecohydrologic models with progressive applications in Brazilian basins are 

SWAT (Bremer et al., 2016; Francesconi et al., 2016; Bressiani et al., 2015), the models 

reviewed by de Mello et al. (2016), Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs 

(InVEST) (Sharp, 2016; Tallis et al., 2011), and Resource Investment Optimization System 

(RIOS) (Vogl et al., 2016). In the hydrological models like Qual 2K, Qual 2E, SWMM, and 

SWAT, input data are converted into system’s   outputs, with both quantity and quality 

variables, which represent the water balance and water quality conditions. Depending on the 

input data availability, the user determines whether the simulations will be carried out over 

annual, monthly, daily, sub-daily time (Boithias et al., 2015), and scheduled time. Since in 



105 
 

 

Brazil daily water quality data are limited, and considering the study's objectives, especially 

related to the dry season (extreme event that persisted for three hydrologic years in the 

Cantareira), we chose to run in a monthly resolution. Then, the precipitation of 2010 was 

applied in the three scenarios.  

The Soil and Water Assessment Tool - SWAT-TAMU (Arnold et al., 1998; Arnold 

and Fohrer, 2005) is a public domain conceptual spatially semi-distributed model, widely 

used in ecohydrological and/or agricultural studies at river basin scale (Krysanova &amp;amp; Whyte, 

2015; Krysanova &amp;amp; Arnold, 2008). It divides the basin into sub-basins based on an elevation 

map and the sub-basins are further subdivided into Hydrological Response Unit (HRU). Each 

HRU represents a specific combination of land use, soil type and slope class within the sub-

basin. The model includes climatic, hydrological, soil, sediments and vegetation components, 

transport of nutrients, pesticides, bacteria, pathogens, BMP, and climate change in a river 

basin scale (Srinivasan et al., 2014; GASSMAN et al., 2014; Arnold et al., 2012).  

The international applications of the ecohydrologic SWAT model have expanded. 

There have been at least 2600 published SWAT studies (SWAT Literature Database, mid-

2016), with at least 400 global peer reviewed studies published/year in the last 3 years. 

Approximately 100 studies were presented in 2016 SWAT Beijing Conference (SWAT, 2016). 

Over 160 studies were presented in the 2015 SWAT Sardinia Conference (SWAT, 2015) and 

in the SWAT Purdue Conference, also held in 2015, 118 studies were presented. Of these 

studies, 8% assessed the transport of nutrients in watersheds (SWAT Purdue, Book of 

Abstracts, 2015). Researches using SWAT, not only for quantity, but also for water quality 

and ecosystem services assessments (Francesconi et al., 2016; Abbaspour et al., 2015; Duku 

et al., 2015; Dagupatti &amp;amp; Srinivasan, 2015; Gassman et al., 2014) and also as an educational 

tool for  

comparing hydrologic processes (Rajib et al., 2016) have increased in recent years.  

Next, we obtained and organized secondary data from the region upstream of the 

Jaguari-Jacareí, Cachoeira and Atibainha reservoirs. We then set up a database originating 

from several sources: Hidroweb (ANA, 2014); Basic Sanitation Company of the State of Sao 

Paulo (SABESP); Integrated Center for Agrometeorology Information (CIIAGRO, 2014); 

Department of Water and Power (DAEE); National Institute of Meteorology (INMET) from 

the Center for Weather Forecasts and Climate Studies (CPTEC/INPE).

Annex-A summarizes all hydrological, pedological, meteorological and land-use data 
used as input for the delineation and characterization of the watersheds. The topographical 

data   used   was   the   Digital   Elevation   Model   “ASTER   Global   DEM”,   2ª   version,   30-m 

(Tachikawa, et al., 2011), available free of charge at: http://gdex.cr.usgs.gov/gdex/. We 

selected the area as defined by UTM coordinates: -22.5833 (north latitude) and -23.333 (south 

latitude); -45.8333 (east longitude) and -46.6667 (west longitude). The depressions of this 

DEM were fixed before making it available to users. 

5.2.3. Model Set up 

The initial model set-up used the ArcSWAT interface, integrated to ArcGIS 10.0 

(Environmental Systems Research Institute - ESRI, 2010), (ArcSWAT 2012.10.15 in ArcGIS 



107 
 

 

10). Simulations of the HRU-based SWAT model were conducted for the 2004–2014 period. 

The first 2 years served as a warm-up period for the model to assume realistic initial 

conditions. The delimitation of the basin using ArcSWAT requires a drainage area threshold, 

and this value is used to outline the sub-basins. We determined the threshold of 710 ha, 

dividing the geographical space to represent the 17 sampling sites in the research field as sub-

basins, adding the three reservoirs, which resulted in 20 sub-basins (Table 5.1). We highlight 

that the basin was designed up to the confluence of the Jaguari and Atibaia Rivers, forming 

the Piracicaba river, to integrate all areas of interest in the same SWAT project.  

The definition of similar HRU was accomplished using the soil maps of Sao Paulo 

(Oliveira, 1999), and land use maps developed by Molin (2014; et al. 2015) from LANDSAT 

5 TM imagery for 2010, processed for a 1:60,000 scale. Although 5 years have elapsed, as it 

is one of the best available land use maps of this region, we used this map to represent the 

current scenario.  Next, we adapted the land use map developed by Guimarães (2013), which 

represents a 2010 land use scenario for the Cantareira System with the restoration of the most 

fragile degraded parcels (greatest potential for sediment production).

We adapted the land use classes of Guimarães (2013) to agree with the land use 

classes of Molin (2014). Additionally, we assumed that the Second Scenario of Guimarães 

(2013), who used the INVEST model to provide the ecological restoration benefits in the 

Cantareira System, could be achieved in 2035, considering the investments provided under 

the PCJ River Plan (Cobrape, 2011) for the recovery of riparian forests in the Cantareira 

System (in the PCJ Basin Plan this is called Tendency Scenario). As in the region the 

restoration of riparian forests is mostly due to Water-PES projects, which was recognized as 

an Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) alternative (CBD, 2010; BFN/GIZ, 2013; Taffarello et 

al., submitted, Chapter 2), we identify the third scenario as S2+EbA. Thus, Figure 5.3 shows 

the land-use changes over time. 

In   the   “Trend   Scenario”(PCJ-COBRAPE, 2011), the municipalities covered by the 

Cantareira System could reach a 98% collection rate, collected sewage treatment rate of 100% 

and BOD5,20 removal efficiency of 95% (Cobrape, 2011). We emphasize that in Brazil the 

current allowed discharge is only based of the BOD5,20 parameter. Some studies have 

suggested the inclusion of other parameters such as dissolved oxygen, nitrate and phosphate 

polluting loads, and sediments to assess the water quality (Cruz, 2015; Cunha et al., 2014). 

Regarding the treatment costs for drinking supply, ecosystem-based adaptation options, such 

as watershed restoration, seems to be more cost-effective than several technologies for water 

treatment (Cunha; Sabogal-Paz &amp;amp; Dodds, 2016).. 

 

5.2.4. Defining contributing areas of sub-basins 

The discretization sub-basins were taken up to fit, if feasible, the same NCE sites of 

available field observations (see Chapter 4 of this thesis). In-site samples were feed into 

SWAT distributed model, also with points of qualitative and quantitative monitoring of 17 

control points. This procedure, combined with the addition of three reservoirs and river mouth 

around the Cantareira System, resulted in the automatic design of 20 sub-basins, with a 

threshold of 7.1 km2 to define sub-basins (Figure 5.8). This threshold is close to the minimum 

drainage area sampled (Taffarello et al, 2016; see Chapter 4 of this thesis). Drainage areas 

ranged approximately 10 to 1000 km2. For optimized calibration, we defined 49 HRU inside 

the 20 sub-basins. In other words, SWAT model defined 49 different combinations of soil 

type, soil cover and slope classes in our study area. 

We highlight some SWAT model limitations when we compare the simulated to 

observed water flows, especially in the dry season. For example, when the model was 



109 
 

 

discretized on a daily resolution, the adherence level between observed and simulated flows 

was considered good. However, the model has not fitted well to observed values during the 

drought period (Fev./2014-May/2014). These differences were more significant for water 

quality parameters, such as nitrate and total phosphorous. We point that the macronutrient 

loads found in May 2014 were clearly higher than the loads we have found in previous 

sampling, which occurred in wetter period (Taffarello et al. 2016). For the sample collected in 

May, the model significantly underestimated the pollutant loads of nitrate. This behavior, 

arising from the recent and most severe drought faced by the Cantareira System (Nobre et al., 

2016; Escobar, 2015; The Economist, 2015; Porto &amp;amp; Porto, 2014, Palmer et al., 2014), shows 

the urgent need for the improvement of the SWAT model performance during extreme events, 

especially to capture non-linearities with impacts in regulating ecosystem services.  

5.2.5. Calibration &amp;amp; validation  

We used the SWAT CUP 5.1.6.2 interfaces and Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-

2 algorithm) for calibrating the quantity and quality parameters and also for validating the 

simulations in the sub-basins. Quantitative calibration was performed in stations that had 

more than two full years of observed data, i.e., 8 stations, namely: Posses outlet, F23, F24, 

F25B, F28, Atibainha reservoir, Cachoeira reservoir, Jaguari and Jacarei reservoir (Table 

5.2). The calibration period was from October 2007 to September 2009, the period with 
observed data in all of the above 8 stations. Validation took place from January 2006 to 

September 2007 and from October 2009 to June 2014. Calibration and validation of SWAT at 

the stations with over 2 years of data were rated as “good”,   according to the classification by 

Moriasi et al. (2007), since the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) criterion (Nash &amp;amp; Sutcliffe, 

1970) was greater than 0.65, except for the Posses outlet, which presented the logarithmic 

Nash-Sutcliffe of flows (a criterion that gives greater weight to smaller flow rates) of less than 

0.5 which was rated as “unsatisfactory”.

Water Supply System.       



111 
 

 

The Percent Bias (PBIAS) statistics indicates the bias percentage of simulated flows 

relative to the observed flows (Gupta et al., 1999). Thus, when the PBIAS value is closer to 

zero, it results in a better representation of the basin, and in lower estimate tendencies 

(Moriasi et al., 2007). As a general rule, if |PBIAS| &amp;lt;10%, it means a very good fit; 10% &amp;lt;| 

PBIAS |&amp;lt;15%, good; 15% &amp;lt;| PBIAS | &amp;lt;25%, satisfactory and | PBIAS | &gt; 25%, the model is 

inappropriate. On the other hand, the NASH coefficient translates the application efficiency of 

the model into more accurate predictions of flood flows, and using the classification: NASH&gt; 

0.65 the model is rated as very good; 0.54 &amp;lt;NASH &amp;lt;0.65 the model is rated as good and 

between 0.5 and 0.54, it is rated as satisfactory.

In the results obtained for different basin scales (Figure 5.4), the PBIAS and NASH 
coefficients (including NASH for logarithms) indicate adequate quantitative adjustments. As 

the SWAT simulations include more than 200 parameters, based on literature surveys (Duku 

et al., 2015; Bressiani et al., 2015; Arnold et al., 2012; Garbossa et al., 2011), we selected 

approximately 10 parameters (see Table 5.3) to complete the calibration to simulate 

streamflow processes and nutrients dynamics. These parameters refer to key processes which 

represent soil water storage, infiltration, evapotranspiration, flow channel, boundary 

conditions (see Mohor et al., 2015b) and main water quality processes at hillslopes. Although 

our calibration is mainly focused on water yield as total runoff, freshwater quality features 

through pollutant loads were performed in the scenarios.  

Moreover, to reduce the uncertainty of our predictions, we used approximately 2500 

primary data derived from the experimental stage of this research to measure the parameters, 

reducing the uncertainties in the estimates of variables in the ecohydrological modeling stage 

of our research. Our decision to complement field and laboratory methods with computational 

tools in order to understand the behavior of basins is justified by Tucci (1998), who explains 

the need for flow and other hydrological variables measurements, in addition to using the 

models, because“none methodology can increase the existing information in the data, but can 

better extract the existing information.” As a parametrization result of field investigations and 

ecohydrological modeling, Figure 5.5 shows parts of calibrated model performance (lines) 
against field observations (dots with experimental uncertainty) for flow discharges, nitrate and 

total phosphorus loads for catchment areas ranging from 7.1 to 508 km2. Finally, other water 

quality variables were studied from data from field sampling. 

Differences in flow rates and water quality (for the variables nitrate, 

phosphate, BOD5,20, turbidity and fecal coliforms) for the 20 sub-basins were evaluated using 

flow and load duration curves for the three scenarios proposed in this study: (i) recently past 

scenario (S1), including the recorded past events for land use in 1990, (ii) current land use 

scenario (S2), which considered land uses for the 2010-2015 period as the baseline, and (iii) 

future land use scenario (S2+EbA), supposing a forest cover conversion in the protected 

areas, through EbA options, according to the PCJ River Basin Plan by 2035. Using these 

curves, from the methodology exposed by Hoekstra et al. (2011), and based on Duku et al. 

(2015) and Cunha et al. (2012), we estimated the grey water footprint (GWF). Next, we 

developed an ecohydrological index to assess the regulating hydrologic services.

km2), (2) F23 (Camanducaia, A = 508 km2), and (3) F24 (Cachoeira, A= 293.5 km2). The 
uncertainty bars were determined using the instantaneous velocities measured in the river 
cross-sections in the 2013-14 field campaigns. 

 

5.2.6. A new index for hydrologic services assessment 

Also, we propose a new index for hydrologic services assessment related to the grey 

water footprint. On the one hand, this new indicator encompasses the former theory related to 

environmental sustainability of the greyWF, according to Hoekstra et al. (2011). In this work, 

as a relevant local impact indicator, Hoekstra et al. (2011) propose   calculating   the   ‘water  

pollution   level’   (WPL)   within   the   catchment,   which   measures   the   degree   of   pollution.   WPL   is  

defined as a fraction of the waste assimilation capacity consumed and calculated by taking the 

ratio of the total of greyWF in a catchment (6WFgrey) to the actual runoff from that catchment 

(Ract), or, in a proxy manner, the water yield or mean water yield or long-term period (Qlp). 

This assumption is that a water pollution level of 100 per cent means that the waste 

assimilation capacity has been fully consumed. Also, this assumption approaches that when 

WPL exceeds 100 per cent, ambient water quality standards are violated, as: 

 

??

WPL x,t&gt; @ 
¦WFgrey x,t&gt; @
Ract x,t&gt; @  



114 
 

 
  

It is worth mentioning that, for some experts, the forementioned equation can 

overestimate the flow necessary to dilute pollutants. For that reason, it is recommended new 

insights of composite indicators or thresholds, as follows. 

On the other hand, the above assumption could overestimate WPL because it would 

fail considering the combined capacity of water to assimilate multiple pollutants (Hoekstra et 

al., 2012; Smakhtin et al., 2005). Conversely, in this work, we define an alternative indicator 

related to the three following fundamentals. First, the WPL should be extended to a composite 

index, thereby representing weights of each pollutant related to the actual runoff, here as a 

proxy of long-term runoff, i.e.: 

 

??

WPLcomposite x,t&gt; @ 
¦ w x,t&gt; @? WFgrey x,t&gt; @^ `
Ract x,t&gt; @#Qlp x,t&gt; @

w x,t&gt; @¦  1  
0 d w x,t&gt; @d1  
 

For this new equation, weights should be assessed, either from field experiments or even from 

simulation outputs. Second, I define a threshold value of WPLcomposite regarding the 

reference catchments with non-developed conditions which suggest more conservation 

conditions among other catchments of the same region, as WPLreference. For this work, we 

selected Domithildes catchment, as the reference catchment with conservancy measures. From 

this reference catchment we define the referenced, composite water pollution level, as 

WPLcom posite,ref and with a derived the Hydrologic Service Index, as a non dimensional factor 

of comparing WPL for referenced and non-referenced catchment, as follows:

5.3. Results and Discussion 

In the following section we present results from field observations, useful not only for 

ecohydrologic parameterization, but also to elucidate features regarding GWF and hydrologic 

services. Next, we compare GWF outputs from simulations of LULC scenarios, including 

EbA options, to finally propose a new hydrological services indicator.

5.3.1. Data from field sampling 

The variations in LULC affect freshwater quality which, in turn, affect the dynamics 

of aquatic ecosystems (Zaffani et al., 2015; Botelho et al., 2013; Hamel et al., 2013; Bach &amp;amp; 

Ostrowski, 2013; Kaiser et al., 2013). These changes impact the hydrological services, 

especially the regulating and supporting ecosystem services (Mulder et al., 2015; Molin, 

2014). Some of the water quality and quantity variables from our freshwater monitoring are 

relevant in the hydrological services assessment, thus they are presented in Table 5.4. These 

variables were selected due to its relation to the anthropic impacts into the water bodies and as 

a function of its sanitary relevance.

Among the water quality variables sampled in field step, we highlight turbidity 

because it indicates a proxy estimation about the total suspended solids in lotic environments 

(UNEP, 2008), related to the LULC conversion and reflect the changes in the hydrological 

services. The Figure 5.6 shows the direct correlation between turbidity and size of the sub-

basins. Turbidity can indirectly indicate anthropic impacts in streams and rivers (Martinelli et 

al., 1999). The lower turbidity mean values were observed in two more conserved sub-basins 

(which presented higher amounts of forest remnants): 2,7 NTU in the reference Cancã farm 

and 4,7 NTU in Upper Posses. Other conserved subbasins also presented low mean values of 

turbidity (&amp;lt;6,5 NTU): intervention Cancã farm (6,2 NTU), and Cachoeira dos Pretos (6,4 

NTU). We found the highest turbidity, above 40 NTU considered the maximum established 

water quality conditions for Class 1 according to environmental standards (BRASIL, 2005), in 

the Parque de Eventos (76,8 NTU), F23 (69,5 NTU) and Salto outlet (50,8 NTU). However, 

these three sampling sites are located at water bodies of Class 2, which the maximum 

turbidity allowed is up to 100 NTU (BRAZIL, 2005). Thus, it shows that, although these 

areas have the highest urbanization among sampled sites, they are in accordance to Brazilian 

environmental resolutions. Arroio Júnior (2013) found a decreasing relation between turbidity 

and drainage area in another catchment located in Sao Paulo state. 

Temporal patterns of turbidity point that in 11 from 17 monitored sites, on the one 

hand, the higher values of turbidity occurred in December 2013, the unique field campaign 

with significant precipitation (35,3 mm) and with higher antecedent precipitation index (API 

= 123,7mm). This can be due to the carrying of allochthone particles which are drained into 

rivers by precipitation. Similarly, Arroio Júnior (2013), also observing higher turbidity in 

rainy month (December 2012) which can lead to erosive processes. On the other hand, Zaffani 

et al. (2015) show that turbidity did not varied over the hydrological year in medium-size, 

rural and peri-urban watersheds ranging from 1 to 242 km2. In this case, other factors can 

have influenced, such as deforestation, seasonal variability, soil use type, sewage and mining 

(CETESB, 2015; Tundisi, 2014). Our study shows two catchments with maximum turbidity 

higher than Brazilian environmental standards (Brazil, 2005): 67 NTU for Upper Jaguari and 

59 NTU for Cancan outlet, one site under this limit (Cancan outlet) and three sites with 

maximum turbidity above 100 NTU: Parque de Eventos, in Jaguari river, with 283 NTU; F23 

gauge in Camanducaia river, with 180 NTU, and Salto outlet, with 160 NTU. These sites do 

not obey the Class II Standards. On the other hand, the Figure 5.7 presents a 

multidimensional chart which integrates hydraulic and water quality variables.

Figure 5.7 illustrates empirical relations from field sampling throughout experimental 

surveys in Oct.2013-May2014, thereby enhancing non-linear relations and complexity of not-

sampled factors. The choice of maximum values for electrical conductivity and nitrate 

concentrations is because it can represent the limit conditions for the rivers autodepuration 

and aquatic ecosystems health. The right quadrants of Figure 5.7 show a positive relationship 
between nitrate concentrations and flow both discharges and mean water level. It is possible 

to infer that higher concentrations of macronutrients would be found in downstream areas. 

This trend can be associated to the nutrients migration (Cunha et al., 2013), land-use change 

(Zaffani et al., 2015), besides punctual pollution. In addition, the absent of riparian forest in 

70% of protected area (36.844 ha) of the Cantareira System (Guimarães, 2013) can increase 

the sedimentation and make the pollutants filtration more difficult, leading to higher nitrate 

concentrations downstream. Furthermore, we could not evidence clear relationships between 

electrical conductivity and measurements of water level and flow discharges (Figure 5.7, left 
side). Besides, the untypical values of 135 µS/cm and 0.074 m3/s show higher sensitivity of 

physico-chemical and hydraulics variables to the external factors, hydrodynamics or seasonal 

local influences. Santos (2014), in a water quality evaluation in watersheds with implemented 

conservation practices (Posses and Salto), found electrical conductivity lower than 50 µS.cm-1 

in forest remnants areas, and more than 100 µS.cm-1 in the stretch of Jaguari river between 

our SWAT subbasin 1 (Upper Jaguari) and subbasin 5 (Parque de Eventos), where  

anthropization covers 3 % of area. In general, areas with higher anthropization rates present 

higher ionic concentrations (Martinelli et al., 1999; Piccirelli Santos, 2014), which can be 

shown by the electrical conductivity. However, outliers values difficult a better 

comprehension of geomorfological health of rivers and of the functioning of complex riverine 

ecosystems with very high biodiversity, as occurs in this subtropical region.  

5.3.2. Setting time-steps of hydrologic modeling under scenarios 

The changes in hydrologic services can be evaluated by a wide number of models 

(Carvalho-Santos et al, 2016; Duku et al, 2015; Quilbé &amp;amp; Rousseau, 2007), especially those 

more user-friendly for stakeholders and policy makers. Simulations in this watershed-scale 

ecohydrological model (Williams et al, 2008; and Borah &amp;amp; Bera, 2003) allow the 

quantification of important variables for ecosystem services analysis and decision-making. 

The evaluation of the results from simulations approaches the balance of the components of 

the hydrological cycle at defined geographic and temporal scales. Hydrological models with 

freshwater quality routines (eg., QUAL-2K, QUAL-2E, SWMM, SWAT) represent the water 



120 
 

 
  

balance and the coupling processes of water quality. Considering the integrated 

ecohydrological processes of an entire river basin, thereby linking LULC changes, greyWF 

outputs and EbA tradeoffs, we here propose a spatially-distributed model which incorporates 

the regional variabilities of field observations in 17 NCE sites (see Chapter 4), with time steps 

in accordance with expected intra-annual river regimes, pointing high flows and low flows. In 

our case, using SWAT for assessing the regulating ecosystem services permit a versatility 

with ecohydrological aspects of water yield and intra-annual regime, integrating water 

quantity and quality to assess expected greyWF under semi-distributed modeling with some 

computational constraints (Tucci, 2015; Santos, 2009). Depending on the availability of input 

data, as a user we can determine the simulations carried by the more appropriate time-steps 

(Boithias et al., 2015). Considering the frequency of qualitative and quantitative data 

available, and according the field experiments (see Chapter 4), monthly time step was defined 

appropriate to hypothesis testing of GWF and water yield under different LULC scenarios, 

including EbA. A common test period for all LULC scenarios was selected with several years. 

In our case, the test period ranges from 01 Jan., 2006 to 30 June 2014. This period has the 

rain-anomaly of drought conditions of 2013-14. In summary, different LULC scenarios were 

tested with the same input data series.  

5.3.3. LULC change scenarios 

We then evaluated the three land-use scenarios. A past-condition scenario (S1, in 

1990), a present-condition (S2, in 2010) and a future (S2+Eba, in 2035) LULC scenario, 

applying the same weather input datafiles, are shown in Table 5.5. This allow us to compare 

the mainly soil uses in 1990, 2010 e 2035 into 20 sub-basins of Cantareira System.

In Table 5.5, sub-basin B. Jaguari has significant percentage of surface waters, 

occupying 1% of sub-basin 10 and 20% of sub-basin 15. We evaluated the effects of LULC 

change scenarios in 20 catchments within Jaguari, Cachoeira and Moinho sub-basins, South-

East Brazil. Concerning the land-use change, the main soil uses 25 years ago were: pasture (in 

50% of the sub-basins) and native vegetation (in 45% of sub-basins). According to ISA 

(2012) and Molin (2014), the 5% of remaining area were divided into vegetables, eucalyptus, 

sparse human settlements, bare soil and mining. The main activity in the past (1990) was the 

extensive cattle for milk production by small farmers in the region (ANA, 2012; Veiga Neto, 

2008).  

In the S2 Scenario (2010), the main soil use is pasture in 58% of the sub-basins and 

forest in 40% of them. Between 1990 and 2010 there was a significant conversion of soil 

cover, with a slow reduction of pasture areas (-2%) and of native remnants (-5%) and with a 

progressive increase of eucalypto (Eucalyptus sp.), an exotic forest in Brazil. The eucalypto 

soil use varied from +1%, within Posses up to +31% in the Chalé Ponto Verde sub-basin in 

2010. Eucalyptus cover, however, did not achieve 10% of the soil uses in any of the simulated 

sub-basins in 1990. In the third scenario (S2 + EbA), we hypothesized incentives to policies 

for forest conservation and restoration, due to the strengthening of EbA in the Cantareira 

System, and could lead to native vegetation achieve percentages between 15% in Posses 

outlet and 69% in F28 sub-basin. In this scenario the higher percentages of native vegetation 

will occur in the sub-basins F28, Upper Jaguari and Cachoeira dos Pretos.  

By assessing the temporal trends of increment or reduction of native remnants, we 

examined the periods 1990-2010 versus 2010-2035. Between 1990 and 2010, forest increased 

positively in 50% in sub-basins of Domithildes, which a reference headwater catchment of the 

Water Producer/PCJ project, (see Taffarello et al., 2016, Chapter 4 of this thesis), Moinho, 

Cachoeira dos Pretos,  F34, B. Jacareí, B. Atibainha, B. Cachoeira, Pq Eventos, F25B and B. 

Jaguari (Figure 5.9). Related to the 2010-2035 period, the model was set up with increasing 

of native vegetation in all sub-basins, either from native remnant in 2010 and even from new 

BMP practices of reforestation with native species in 20 sub-basins until year 2035 (Figure 
5.9). The hidro-services in Posses and Salto catchments and in the Cachoeira sub-basin will 

be increased in 2035 as a function of the efforts on EbA which currently exist in the region 

(Richards et al., 2015; Piccirelli Santos, 2014; Gonçalves, 2013).  



124 
 

 
  

 
Figure 5.9. Native forests cover in S1 (year 1990), S2 (year 2010) and S2+EbA (year 2035). 
 

Despite this general increasing of native forest cover, we highlight the deforestation 

occurred in the F23 sub-basin, Camanducaia river. Currently, although it has 34% of native 

forest cover, this rate trend to have reducing since 1990. F23 outlet (sub-basin 2) presented 

37% of native forest cover in 1990, becoming 34 % in 2010 and, the S2+EbA Scenario shows 

that F23 would achieve 36.2%   of   native   forest   in   2035,   backing   to   the   1990’s   rates.   Another  

critical situation is the Posses outlet (SWAT sub-basin 6): despite the conservation efforts 

which have been performed in the region through Water Conservator project (see Richards et 

al., 2015; Piccirelli Santos, 2014; Pereira, 2013), the current percentage of native remnants is 

13%, which can become 16% in 2035, however  not  achieving  the  1990’s  rate  (22%).  This  can  

potentially disrupt the regulating and provision hydrologic services provided by Posses sub-

basin and needs to be deeply evaluated. 

Next, we analyze spatio-temporal patterns of the main soil uses which competing with 

forest cover: pasture and eucalypto. First, related to pasture, we observe that it was the main 

use in the past in 60% of the sub-basins (in 1990) and, currently, it became the majority 

LULC by ca. 40%. Our scenarios indicate that, as a function of the EbA strengthening, 

encouraging the links between environmental conservation and forest restoration, 20% of the 

sub-basins can be mainly occupied by pasture (sub-basins 2, 4, 6 and 7). This rate is 

reasonable, considering rural sub-basins. Moreover, the reducing of pasture in the Cantareira 

System was more evident in the 1990-2010 period than in the 2010-2035scenario. This can be 

explained by, at least, three factors: i) rural landowners awareness of the relevance of 



125 
 

 

conversion from pasture to native forest for the generation and maintenance of ecosystem 

services in the Cantareira System (Saad, 2016; Extrema, 2015; Mota da Silva, 2014; Padovezi 

et al., 2013; Gonçalvez, 2013; Veiga-Neto, 2008); ii) seasonal changes in the ecosystem 

structure which can increase the ecosystem resilience (Mulder et al., 2015) and observed 

significant increasing, mainly in the 1990-2010 period, of non-native species plantation.   

Second, related to eucalypto cover, the future scenario shows an increasing threat to 

the regulating and supporting services as a result of the exotic forest in expansion.  In 2035, 

eucalypto cover can encompass, in average, 12% of the total area of the 20 catchments here 

studied. This is significant in comparison with 10% in 2010 and only 2% in 1990 for the same 

catchments. This scenario until 2035 takes attention for the maintenance of hydrologic 

services, because eucalypto monocrop can potentially impact not only on headwaters but on 

entire landscapes, threatening ecosystem dynamics. Moreover, these plantations, with an 

average wood yield of 50 to 60 m3of Urograndis per hectare, need for higher amounts of 

agrochemicals, due to lower population diversity and lower adaptation to climate change 

(Kageyama &amp;amp; dos Santos, 2015). In short, here we highlight the threat on biodiversity that 

have been brought by alien species in headwaters and the changes that it can promote on 

native species (Hulme &amp;amp; Le Roux, 2016) which, in turn,  impact the ecosystem services. 

Considering the river basin as the management unit, the soil uses impact not only on 

quantity, but also on quality. Thus, we analyse water and nutrient yields, intra-annual regime 

and duration curves, both in quantity-quality of pollutants, in the following topics. 

5.3.2.3. Water yield as a function of soil cover 

Although the water-forest system interaction is a classic issue in Hydrology (Hibbert, 

1967; Tucci &amp;amp; Clarke, 1998; Adreássian, 2004; Zhao et al., 2012), the comprehension of the 

impacts of vegetation on quali-quantitatives aspects of water resources needs refinements.  

At hydrological methodologies, the use of expressive variable numbers in describing 

the hydrological regime for riparian ecosystems conservation is valuable (Collischonn et al., 

2005). In this context, the assessment of simulations occurs through analysis of balance of 

hydrological cycle components at determined spatial and temporal scales. The results analysis 

was performed, on the one hand, from regional comparison related to the size of drainage 

areas and, on the other hand, by the hydrological function which features water and nutrients 

availability. 

The selection of hydrologic function which characterizes the water availability can be 

concerned to representativeness of environmental and physical processes which occur at 



126 
 

 
  

catchment scale in a dynamic way (Cruz &amp;amp; Tucci, 2008). In this work, we selected using 

quali-quantitative duration curves for integrated assessment of availability and quality of 

water. The flow-and-load duration curve is a simple and important analysis (Collischonn &amp;amp; 

Dornelles, 2013). In quantitative terms, the flow duration curve shows the probabilistic 

temporal distribution of water availability (Cruz &amp;amp; Silveira, 2007), relating the flow discharge 

passing at one river cross section related to a percentage of time in which it is overpassed or 

equaled (Cruz &amp;amp; Tucci, 2008).     

The three scenarios S1, S2 and S2+EbA resulted in different flow values for the 20 

sub-basins (Figure 5.10). Based on arithmetic mean of time series of monthly water yield, 

related to catchment areas, and assessed to all modelled sub-basins (N=20), results point 

average values water yield of: 31.4 ± 25.2 L.s-1.km-2 for S1 (1990), 14.9 ± 11.5L.s-1.km-2 for 

S2(2010) and 21.4 ± 15.3 L.s-1.km-2 for S2+EbA (2035), respectively. This very high variation 

can be due to the complexity of river basin systems and the several sources of uncertainty in 

the representation of ecohydrological processes.  

The three scenarios analized and the ecohydrologic monitoring (Chapter 4) provide 

different types of information for the same catchments. But how can we integrate the relative 

importance of information from each source (Kapustka &amp;amp; Landis, 2010)? A detailed study 

showing the relationship between sensitivity (and uncertainty) of analysis and the 

effectiveness of Water-PES should be done.  

For a while, the decrease of -52.4% in water yield between S1 (1990) and S2 (2010) 

scenarios (= (14.9-31.3)/31.3.100) could be due to marginal increases of eucalypto cover. In 

fact, between 1990 and 2010, eucalypto cover increased +6.8 % in total land cover, but 

+181% in relative terms. Other possible explanation is the decrease of native vegetation 

between 1990 and 2010, with -1.8 % in total land cover, but -4.3%, in relative terms.  

In parallel, we evaluate the water yield. Thus, the flow-and-load duration curves 

summarize the flow and pollutant load variability, thereby showing potential links and 

impacts for aquatic ecosystem sustainability (Cunha et al., 2012; Cruz &amp;amp; Tucci, 2008).  From 

these curves, we obtained two different behaviours for the studied sub-basins (Figure 5.10): 
Behaviour I: the water yield in 2010 reduced in relation to 1990 and the water yield in 

2035 might overpass the 1990 levels. The examples are:Upper Jaguari, Cachoeira sub-basin 

(including Cachoeira dos Pretos, Chalé Ponto Verde, Ponte Cachoeira, F24 outlet) and 

Moinho catchment; 



127 
 

 

Behaviour II: the water yield after 2010 was reduced until 2035 and this water yield 

recuperation was not possible for the values in 1990. Examples, in decreasing size of drainage 

areas, are: Atibainha, B. Jaguari, F25B, Parque de Eventos, F23, B.Atibainha, F34, F30, 

Salto, Posses Outlet, Domithildes, Portal das Estrelas (Middle Posses).

S2(2010) and S2+EbA (2035) in 20 catchments at headwaters of Cantareira Water Supply 
System. 



128 
 

 
  
On the one hand, according to Figure 5.11, the water yield of S1 is inversely 

proportional to land use of mixed forest cover. The water yield in S2 indicates a constant 

value of approximately 17 L s-1km-2. Also for the S2+EbA scenario, with incorporates the 

EbA approach through BMP, the water yield is approximately 17 L s-1km-2, but with slight 

increase in the water yield for mixed forest cover higher than 50%. Presumably, this slight 

increase in the water yield would be related to the type of the best management practices 

(BMP) of the recovery forests, which still not achieved evapotranspiration rates of the climax 

stage. In riparian forest under recuperation there are lesser evapotranspiration rates and, thus, 

more quantity of precipitation reach soil and rivers through canopy. This process could 

benefit other hydrological components, like runoff, increasing water flows into the rivers. 

This effect can possibly explain the behaviour I catchments (see Fig. 5.10). 

On the other hand, we observed in Posses, Salto, Jaguari, Cancã and Atibainha 

catchments an inverse situation (behaviour II). This effect can be related to the hydrologic 
response produced by: (a) type of catchment; (b) size of catchment; (c) the low soil moisture 

in the red-yellow latosol (Embrapa, 2016), which did not favor high evapotranspiration rates; 

(d) the riparian forest, originates from the EbA or Water-PES actions, will be at initial stages, 

not achieving in 20 years (this explanation thereby assumes the baseline of PES actions held 

in 2015, spite of existing examples of restored forests in Extrema-MG the higher 

evapotranspiration rates we usually find in forests at climax); and (e) unpredictability, non-

linearity and uncertainty (Ferraz et al., 2013; Lima &amp;amp; Zakia, 2006). 

The forest role in the hydrological cycle at river basin scales has been debated for 

centuries. Riparian native forest, eucalypto and riparian forest in recuperation (orchard) have 

different hydrological responses. The knowledge about influence of different types and phases 

of vegetation in the hydrological processes still has gaps to be fulfilled. Bayer (2014) found 

that the vegetation height and the leaf area index are inversely proportional to the water flows, 

which corroborate previous studies (Hibbert, 1967). Riparian forest restoration increases the 

mean evapotranspiration, reducing the water yield (Molin, 2014; Salemi et al., 2012; Lima &amp;amp; 

Zakia, 2006; Andreassian, 2004). Restoration increases the water storage capability into the 

catchment throughout the riparian zone, contributing to the higher water flow in the dry 

season (Lima &amp;amp; Zakia, 2000). This can lead to unexpected results regarding water yield. 

Furthermore, at small catchments of temperate climate, researchers estimated that 

deforestation in 40% of the catchment would increase the runoff of 130 ± 89 mm.year-1 

considering the entire water cycle at catchment scale (Collischonn &amp;amp; Dornelles, 2013). Still 



129 
 

 

there are large dispersion in results from monitoring (usually, in paired catchments or Nested 

Catchment Experiment - NCE), which makes the forecast of flow discharge as a result of soil 

use conversion more difficult. Similarly, we found high dispersion in the comparison between 

water yields versus different land cover in 20 sub-basins of subtropical climate (Figure 5.11).   

 

 
Figure 5.11. LULC scenarios for specific water yield for 20 drainage areas at Jaguari, 
Cachoeira and Atibainha watersheds, according to S1 (1990), S2 (2010) and S2+EbA (2035) 
scenarios.  

 

BMP are in progress since 2005 in Posses Outlet (sub-basin 6, Table 5.5) and Middle 

Posses (Portal das Estrelas, Nº 7), and since 2009 in Domithildes, F30 and Moinho 

catchments (Subbasins 9, 11 and 20, respectively). These BMP are from Water Conservator 

and Water Producer/PCJ. In these cases, we point to have caution when support PES as the 



130 
 

 
  

main driver linking reforested cover areas to more water availability (ANA, 2013). Parts of 

these results and previous investigation, which has been made through NCE (Taffarello et al., 

2016, chapter 4 of this thesis), point the opposite, i.e., in the more conserved catchments we 

found lower water yields. Despite there are many Water-PES programs in Brazil (Pagiola, von 

Glehn &amp;amp; Taffarello, 2013; Guedes &amp;amp; Seehusen, 2011), measurements of the effect on water 

yield under forest restoration are still lacking in tropical and subtropical conditions (Taffarello 

et al., 2016a; Salemi et al., 2012). However, the benefits of riparian forest on water quality, 

margin stability, reduction of water erosion and silting are also evident in scientific literature 

(Piccirelli Santos, 2014; dos Santos et al., 2014; Studinski et al., 2012; Udawatta et al., 2010).  

5.3.2.4. Relationships between land-use/land-cover change and grey water footprint 

For an integrated assessment of hydro-services, we analyze the spatio-temporal 

conditions of load production at the sub-basin scale. Considering we are studying rural sub-

basins, the water pollution is mainly produced by diffuse source regarded to fertilizers and 

agrochemicals. In this context, we evaluate the GWF evolution to show the behaviours of 

nitrate (N-NO3), total phosphorous (TP) and sediments (Sed) yields from simulating scenarios 

S1, S2 and S2+EbA. First, we calculate the nitrate loads generated from the 20 sub-basins in 

the three scenarios. Second, we made the same for total phosphorous loads and sediment 

yields.  Third, encompassing the river regime, we calculated the greyWF for nitrate, total 

phosphorous and sediments in each sub-basin, to develop new sustainable and composite 

indices. 

Concerning nitrate, the sampled concentrations were low (see previous chapter). In 

addition, SWAT simulations also brought very low outputs, and the greyWF-NO3 vary from 

0.11 L/s per km2 (in Atibainha subbasin, under S2 (2010) scenario) to 2.83 L/s per km2 (in 

Middle Posses catchment, Portal das Estrelas, under S2+EbA (2035) scenario). Considering 

Brazilian water quality standards for nitrate, the maximum allowed concentration is 10 mg/L 

(Brasil, 2005). These low amounts of nitrate loads make the greyWF-NO3 falling to low 

values in the three scenarios analyzed (Figure 5.12a). Complementary, we have also chosen 

to explore greyWF for total phosphorous and sediments. 

In relation to total phosphorous (TP), the load duration curves from S1, S2 and 

S2+EbA scenarios present disparities. For example, the greyWF for TP decreased in all sub-

basins between 1990, 2010 and 2035. In this last period (2010-2035), the model predicts a 

new behaviour for the greyWF-TP.  



131 
 

 

 

 
Figure 5.12. Fraction of water yield compromised by the grey water footprint for nitrate, total 
phosphorous and sediments versus drainage area (a), and showing the studied subbasins (b). 
 

Results of greyWF for TP, NO3 and sediments allow us to infer some regionalization 

for nutrient loads. Among the 20 sub-basins studied, we selected 2 sub-basins as study cases 

to illustrate the links between LULC and greyWF: (1) the Upper Jaguari subbasin, and (2) 

Domithildes catchment.  

5.3.2.4.1 Case study I: Upper Jaguari sub-basin 

The Upper Jaguari has 302 km2 and is the second most upstream sub-basin within the 

Cantareira System (downstream of only F28 sub-basin, with 277 km2). Comparing scenario 

1990 (S1) and 2010 (S2), results depicted evidence that native forest decayed aprox. 10 %. 

Indeed, scenario 2035 (S2+EbA) still assumes a very small decrease of native forest. This fall 



132 
 

 
  

could be potentially traded off through increasing secondary forests by BMP, that would 

stabilise the native forest LULC in 70% until 2035.The mean annual simulated water yields, 

in spite of high variability of simulated scenarios, pointed values of 18 L.s-1.km2 (1990, S1), 

13 L.s-1.km2 (2010, S2) and 21 L.s-1.km2 (for 2035, S2+EbA). Variabilities are related to 

hydrologic conditions simulated in the test period of 2006 until 2014. In turn, this test period 

was selected due to high availability of rainfall stations under operation, which would 

potentially better perform distributed modeling at several sub-basis using SWAT. In 

summary, for the three scenarios simulated, the relationships between the native forest cover 

and mean water yield are different each other. For scenario S1 (1990), the higher native forest 

cover, the lower water yield. This scenario behavior is extended at experimental sites, and 

even extensively documented in the literature (Salemi et al, 2012; Smarthust et al., 2012, 

Collischon &amp;amp; Dornelles, 2013). In turn, for scenario S2 (2010) the water yield seems not fully 

related to native forest LULC, oscillating around an average value of 18 L/s/km2. In scenario 

S2+EbA (2035), however, there is a little increase in water yield when native forest cover is 

higher than 50%. This proportional relation between water yield and forest cover in the 

S2+EbA is both controversial and contrary with results published by some authors (e.g. 

Collischonn &amp;amp; Dornelles, 2013; Salemi et al., 2012). For example, in previous chapter, 

monitoring data shows reduction in the water yield with higher native forest land cover 

(Taffarello et al., 2016a). Salemi and coauthors, in a review on the effect of riparian forest on 

water yield, found that riparian vegetation cover decreases water yield from daily to annual 

basis. 

Furthermore, the greyWF-NO3 of Upper Jaguari basin pointed 0.14 L/s per km2 for 

scenario S1 (1990), increased to 0.23 L/s per km2 for scenario S2(2010) and would grow to 

ca. 0.54 L/s per km2 in S2+EbA scenario (in 2035). Lower values of greyWF of nitrates, 

althouth represent lower water volume needed to dillute nitrates flowing to streams per square 

kilometer of draining catchment. This results, however, is different of expected in the 

hypothesis testing through modeling. The null hypothesis says increasing native forest cover 

is correlated to decreasing nutrient loads flowing to streams. The former results, modelled by 

SWAT, predicted an increase in greyWF in 2035. Simulated increase of native forest (approx. 

+5%) would appear to be not enough for buffering nitrogen loads from both pesticides and 

animals’   excrements   like   mammals   or   zooplâncton.   For   deeper analysis, other factors 

influenced on greyWF should be evaluated at all. 



133 
 

 

Concerning greyWF in Upper Jaguari sub-basin in S2+EbA (2035) scenario, SWAT 

outputs assessed ca. 0.1L/s per km2 related to total phosphorous (TP) and 0 L/s per km2 for 

sediments. In this subbasin, diffuse pollution from nitrates would be (or lower than) 5 times 

higher than pollution from TP. Adaptive management are needed to avoid future problems of 

eutrophication, caused by excessive nitrogen in waters. As nitrogen is highly mobile in 

freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, surface water nitrate isotopes could be used to monitor 

nitrogen variations in catchment-scale attenuation, as proposed by Wells et al. (2016). In this 

context, the calculus of greyWF for nitrate, using nitrate isotopes (?15N   and   ?18O of NO3-2), 

could be an auxiliary tool in understanding spatial and temporal variations in nitrogen export 

throughout the catchments. 

5.3.2.4.2 Case study II: Domithildes headwater 

Domithildes catchment (9.9 km2) is located in Cancã catchment. Similar to Upper 

Jaguari, Domithildes is one of the most conserved sub-basins, mainly with native forests. By 

comparing S1 and S2 (see Figure 5.14), native forest fraction remained constant (51% in 
S1(1990) and 52% in S2 (2010). Unlike Upper Jaguari sub-basin (see Figure 5.13), native 

vegetation would increase by 56% in S2+EbA (2035). Because Domithildes is adopted as 

reference basin for Water Producer/PCJ, the augmented fraction of native forest by 2035 

would point an increase of secondary forest.  

Regarding water yield, Domithildes catchment   classified   as   second   type   of   ‘subbasins 

behaviour’.   For   example, its annual water yield in 2010 (~18 L/s per km2) was smaller than in 

1990 (~ 29 L/s per km2). Since 2010 onwards, however, water yield would replenish towards 

S2+EbA conditions in 2035, close to 23L/s per km2. This positive increment between 2010 

and 2035, although, would not achieve values obtained for S1 conditions in 1990.  

Other factors, beyond of native vegetation, would influence the hydrologic cycle at 

Domithildes catchment, decreasing water yields in the 2010 scenario (S2). One explanation of 

this water yield decrease would be the positive LULC of Eucaliptus sp. of +5% in 2010 (S2). 

Salemi et al. (2012) presented a review results as increased annual water use, as 

evapotranspiration, for each 10% of area covered with eucalypto, pinus, acacia or native 

subtropical species beside the stream ranged from 11 to 112 mm per year. Smethurst et al. 

(2015) estimated a water use by native riparian tropical Brazilian forest of 84 mm per year 

(7% of annual precipitation). Regardless other factors, according to previous statements, +1% 

of eucalipto land use fraction in Domithildes will represent -2 L/s/km2 of water yield, or -63 



134 
 

 
  

mm per year, in the same range of results reported by Salemi (2012) and close to Semthurst et 

al (2015).  

Comparing seasonal water yields, results pointed higher variability around monthly 

flow averages for S2+EbA (2035) scenario. These deviations in monthly flows of 2035 

scenario were higher in wetter months, between November and March. The regulation of 

water yield, in both rainy and dry conditions, is more effective when quantifyied through 

variance (Molin, 2014). In spite of these uncertainties, scenarios modeled through SWAT 

estimated the highest mean monthly water yield in February (38 L/s per km2) and the lowest 

mean monthly water yield in September and October (8 L/s per km2). On the one hand, results 

pointed that growing rate of native vegetation LULC since 2010 would serve to attenuate both 

e-flows peaks, especially in the rainy season (see flow duration curves), and pollutants 

filtration (see duration curves of N-NO3 loads). On the other hand, the more native forest 

cover, the lower water yield (Bayer, 2014; Molin, 2014; Burt&amp;amp; Swank, 1992). Thus the 

progressive augmentation of water yield between 2010 and 2035, in companion with higher 

total forest cover, would indicate other factors, such as forest connectivity, forest climax and 

secondary factors like BMP,  that would produce non-linear conditions for water yield, from 

the local scale to catchment scale. 

Likewise, water yield is related to the absolute value of integrating the flow duration 

curve. For example, the flow duration curve of S1 (1990) exceeded other   scenarios’  curves  in  

approximately 75¨% of time, with differentiated behaviour in both peak flows (lower 

probability) and low flows (higher probability of duration curves).

5.3.3. Results of a new index for hydrologic services assessment 

A new index for hydrologic service assessment is here developed as a simple relation 

between greyWF and water yield, using a fraction between water demand (numerator) and 

availability (denominator). Some authors commonly use this fraction as a direct approach to 

water scarcity (i.e. Smakhtin, et al., 2005; Hoekstra et al, .2013; McNulty et al., 2010; among 

others).  Therefore, we first assessed greyWF by respective drainage basins (Figure 5.15). 

Then we calculated the water pollution levels.

Phosphorous (lower chart) according to three LULC scenarios (Year 1990, 2010 and 2035)

Results in Figure 5.16 show the composite water pollution level (WPLcomposite) 

versus drainage areas and compared with the HSI. The baseline WPLcomposite,ref is related 

to Domithildes catchment (horizontal, dotted line in Figure 5.16). This line divides the 
graphic in two regions: less sustainable basins (HSI&gt;0) and more sustainable basins (HIS&lt;=0). 

More sustainable basins (HIS&lt;0) are Salto, Cachoeira nested catchments (Cachoeira dos 

Pretos, Chalé Ponto Verde and Ponte Cachoeira), as well as F28, F24 and Upper Jaguari 

basin.

5.5 Conclusions and Recommendations 

Supported by field experiments and quali-quantitative simulations under different 

scenarios including EbA options with BMP, our results showed evidence for non-linear 

relationships among LULC, water yield, greyWF of nitrate, total phosphorus and sediments, 

which irreversibly affect the composite of water pollution level (WPL), the definition of WPL 

of reference (here established at Domithildes catchment) and the hydrologic services index 

(HSI). Despite using semi-distributed model for assessing non-point sources of pollution 

mainly tested under different LULC scenarios, our results showed that the intrinsic nature of 

flow-load duration curves, LULC and greyWP are constrained to high uncertainties and to 

nonlinearities both from in-situ sampling and from processes interactions of modelling. 

Results show the need of considering several uncertainty sources, such as: sensitivity analysis, 

observed streamflow data, ecohydrologic model performance, residual analysis, etc. To attain 

goals of EbA, using HSI through GWF assessment and composite of WPL, some conditions 

are needed, as follows: (i) to avoid the inputs of high-concentrated pollutants, especially 

growing urban settlements, (ii) to restore riparian vegetation and (iii) trapping and removing 

inflowing sediments. For rivers ecosystems health, we used HSI, flow regimes and 

WPLcomposite, as an alternative proposal of defining environmental flows (Tharme, 2003; 

Olden et al., 2011; Poff &amp;amp; Zimmerman, 2010; Poff &amp;amp; Matthews, 2013). Although the role of 

vegetation on streamflow has been intensely studied, very few investigations have been 

reported in Brazil which control nutrient sources, transportation and delivery. Furthermore, 

from the vision of integrating LULC, EbA and greyWF, further in-field and modeling 

frameworks are needed, thereby regarding the influence of vegetation on water quality and the 

role of anthropogenic and natural drivers in catchment-scale ecohydrological processes.

CHAPTER  6 

6. CONCLUDING REMARKS 

“The solution of water-related challenges encompasses the environmental literacy, resources 
management in a transdisciplinary way (Odum &amp;amp; Barrett, 2014) and highlight the water focus on 
sustainability sciences.” (Sivapalan et al., 2014) 
 

This thesis is the first comprehensive, quali-quantitative, and multi-scale assessment on 

the conversion of land use and its effects on hydrologic services in the overall Cantareira 

Water Supply System, South-East Brazil. Previous studies on freshwater in the Upper 

Piracicaba basin (where headwaters of Cantareira System are located) have focused on only 

one or two catchments and only involve modelling or field works. 

Field investigations as well as ecohydrologic simulation models are needed for a 

complete and reliable accounting to assess hydrological services. The evaluation of 

hydrological dynamics, which impacts hydrological services, is an interdisciplinary 

management strategy to optimize the delivery of ecosystem services at catchment scales. This 

was developed in four steps along this research. 

Chapter 2 presents a review of ongoing payment for hydrological ecosystem services 

in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and proposes ecohydrological insights which can make PES 

(Payment for Ecosystem Services) programs a promising tool for the conservation of water 

resources. First, Chapter 2 presents a concise overall summary of hydrological PES issues at 

the Latin American and Brazilian national levels. Second, it presents a thorough overview of 

hydrological/PES in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome. I included in this review some 

projects that, because they are not (yet) aligned with the guidelines of the Water Producer 

Program, are rarely catalogued in publications. The findings presented here demonstrate that, 

although Brazilian PES projects for watershed protection have increased in the past decade, 

they lack monitoring and adapting strategies to cope with water challenges in basins under 

change. The lack of scientific knowledge and monitoring of hydrologic services (methods for 

testing the delivery of hydro-services) are impediments that prevent strengthening PES for 

watershed protection in Brazil. Third, I suggest a list of ecohydrological variables which 

would help to delineate and rank hydrologic-PES projects, possibly helping reduce the 

vulnerability of land-use or climate change impacts, thereby focusing on the Ecosystem-based 

Adaption. At last, considering some difficulty to find comparable informations about Water-



149 
 

 

PES projects in the Brazil’s Atlantic Forest, I recommend publishing Brazilian Water-PES in 

peer-reviewed journals to provide a broader audience to the initiatives, since new projects can 

learn from the experiences of previously developed Water-PES projects. 

Based on the outcomes of Chapter 2, I then selected one hydrologic-PES issue in the 

Brazilian Atlantic Forest for an in-depth analysis, asking how anthropogenic disturbances at 

catchment and watershed scales can influence the hydrologic services using both field 

investigations (Chapter 4) and ecohydrological watershed-scale models (Chapter 5). To 

answer this question, I first developed a hydrological monitoring plan, which is the essence of 

Chapter 3. Therefore, Chapter 3 introduces the Freshwater Monitoring Plan of the Water 

Producer/PCJ project. Based on this, it is then possible to evaluate the effects of the 

conservation project actions under the qualitative and quantitative aspects; and promote 

incorporating the elements from this plan in water resources planning and management. The 

proposed freshwater monitoring plan is sufficiently wide-ranging to be adapted and 

implemented in other catchments which are eligible areas for PES projects. It is observed that 

the inclusion of a group of interdisciplinary experts in medium and long term monitoring is 

needed for producing more credible results. This planning is crucial to bring scientifically 

meaningful, cost-effective baseline data and to implement effective monitoring 

programs.Only if there are both, baseline and monitoring together, it is possible to verify the 

additionality of the Water-PES project.  

Chapter 4 comprises the results of 17 nested catchment experiments during six field 

campaigns, December 2012 – May 2014. The sampling sites are located in the drainage area 

of the Cantareira Water Supply System donor reservoirs, representatives of Jaguari, Cachoeira 

and Atibainha sub-basins. Comparing reference catchments with intervention catchments (i.e. 

catchments that have participated in the Water Producer/PCJ project since 2009), it showed an 

inverse correlation between forest cover and water yield. This implies that water production 

will possibly be lower with forest increase as a result of the Water Producer/PCJ project and 

other conservation synergies. However, water quality, ecosystems and humans can benefit 

from this expected forest increase. In this regard, the regionalization of phosphate and nitrate 

loads versus drainage area here proposed can indicate the pollutant load for any river stretch 

in the headwaters of Cantareira System. This nutrient migration from headwaters to 

downstream areas can cause eutrophication effects in water supply reservoirs. The procedure 

of regionalized loads for rating curves can be an application guideline for the headwaters of 

other reservoirs in Brazil or abroad. Considering that these empirical evidences were analyzed 



150 
 

 
  

during a period characterized as a low-precipitation anomaly in South-East Brazil, the results 

are even more informative and potentially useful for decision-makers in the future. 

Finally, Chapter 5 concludes that the water needed for regulating ecosystem services 
can be estimated using the grey water footprint (non-consumptive water use) through a 

comprehensive, simple and integrated assessment. 20 sub-basins in the Cantareira System 

were simulated using SWAT (17 from the previous chapter plus the 3 reservoir sub-basins) in 

three scenarios, past, present and future, where I incorporated EbA assumptions. On the one 

hand, nitrate leaching simulations, total phosphorous and sediments allowed the 

regionalization of grey water footprint (greyWF) of each pollutant at different spatial scales 

under land-use/land-cover changes. On the other hand, the simulated conservation practices 

not only predict additional, viable and best management practices, but also preventive and 

robust decision-making for the headwaters of water supply systems. Despite some difficulty 

to access adequate quality input data for SWAT simulations, the scenarios allowed developing 

a new ecohydrologic index for assessment of regulating ecosystem services. This index was 

built from flow/load duration curves and the greyWF, and summarizes the knowledge 

available in the adaptation measures. It can be the basis for future proper valuation and 

protection of hydrologic services.  

This research has significantly expanded our understanding of subtropical streams 

facing LULC pressures, by using cutting-edge technological tools (SWAT model and WF 

indicator) and experimental approach, endorsing ecohydrological monitoring in the 

headwaters studied. Not only in terms of assessing the model outputs or greyWF estimates, 

but also in terms of providing appropriate long term monitoring, there are many challenges to 

overcome as well as opportunities for future research. Despite the need for a more detailed 

understanding of responses to anthropogenic impacts on water resources, it cannot be used as 

an excuse to delay conservation strategies and improved management, in light of the rapid 

loss rates of ecosystem services. 

The conceptual model developed in this research is an effective auxiliary method for 

integrated water resources management, to assure water quality and quantity security for both 

freshwater ecosystems and humans in strategic catchments under change. Once more, I 

highlight the cooperation of my co-advisor and advisor, co-authors, international journals 

reviewers and FAPESP advisor in this knowledge building process. Without them, this work 

would not be possible.

ABSTRACT 
 

 
River pollutant loads encompass a combination of natural and anthropogenic 

factors related to land use and landcover (LULC). Progressive changes in LULC can 
significantly alter pollutant behaviors of changing flows and pollutant concentrations, 
reducing biodiversity, and emerging uncertainties regarded to poor gauged basins. To assess 
the factors involved in the generation of pollutant loads, this paper examined empirical 
uncertainties from observed pollutant loads in river basins through nested catchment 
experiments (NCE). Monitored river flows, concentration and drainage areas of each NCE 
were associated with LULC in order to determine specific pollution generation coefficients 
per unit of drainage area (Ys) of BOD, a- chlorophyll, NTK, TSS, and Total Coliforms. Three 
Brazilian watersheds were tested with drainage areas ranging from 0.93 km  to 242 km , and 
under different conditions of: (1) LULC (urban, forest and agricultural), (2) numbers of NCEs 
(2 to 11), (3) sampling seasons (1 to 4), (4) antecedent precipitation index (dry or wet 
conditions) and (5) biomes (Atlantic Forest and Cerrado-savanna). LULC appraisal showed 
complex upstream-downstream uncertainties of BOD, a-chlorophyll, and TSS from both 
urban and rural areas. Therefore, limitations of addressing representative values of specific 
pollution loads were preliminarily regarded due to the lack of continuous spatiotemporal 
schemes of experimental data at NCEs linked to existing point-sources and progressive 
LULC. Conclusions of this paper would benefit decision-makers on adapting resilient-driven 
land use plans to cope with regional pollution disaster risk management in Brazilian river 
basins.

ABSTRACT 
 

 
Protecting freshwater resources requires evaluating pollutant loads. This study aims 

toassess a linking between load duration curves and grey water footprint based on 
ecohydrological indicators at watersheds under land use/land cover changes. There are some 
steps to show the applicability of the methodology. First, we considered ecohydrological 
indicators of flood pulses across river cross-sections, floodplain and regime duration. Second, 
we applied the methodology to compare total phosphorus-LDCs, TMDL and GWF at Jaguari 
River to other catchments in the Atlantic Forest biome. Third, we defined new 
ecohydrological indicators at 5%, 50% and 95% of time, namely, range of ecohydrological 
load ratio, (rELR), total ecohydrological flow variation (tEFV), and total ecohydrological 
load variation (tELV). On the one hand, rELR values decreased with catchment size, from 
5.63 at Jaguari River to 2.85 and 1.93 at larger scales. On the other hand, tEFV also pointed 
scale-dependant behavior, ranging from - 157.8 L/s per km2 at Jaguari River to -32.6 L/s per 
km2 and +2.8 L/s per km2. Results depicted potential   hotspots,   with   surplus   of   TP   ? 0.13 
mg/L, could co-exist   withresilient   catchments   with   surplus   of   TP   ? 0.32 mg/L.This integrated 
method facilitates the visualization of impactson water resources regarding land-use/land-
cover change offering a tool for proactive management.
