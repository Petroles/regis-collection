ABSTRACT

A geochemical modeling of gold deposition was performed using the EQ3/EQ6 software package using

conditions inferred from geological, petrographic, geochemical and fluid inclusion data from the Bloco do

Butiá gold mine, Lavras do Sul, RS. Gold in the mine occurs only in the pyrite structure (invisible gold).

The pyrite occurs associated with white mica (phengite) in the zone of phyllic alteration. The process of

gold deposition showed to be related to temperature and pH decrease. The pH decrease was fundamental to

gold deposition by destabilization of sulfur species [Au(HS)?2 , HAu(HS)
0
2 and Au(HS)

0] dissolved in the

aqueous solution, being Au(HS)0 the main gold transporting complex. The addition of KCl is hard to accept

as cause of gold precipitation because no Cl– was detected in phengite. However, the geochemical mass

balance calculation resulted in the gain of some potassium in the zone of phyllic alteration. The precipitation

of pyrite (± auriferous) may have been strongly influenced by iron availability resulting from dissolution
of ferrous chlorites by the fluids responsible for phengite deposition. The low salinity in quartz grain fluid

inclusions from the propylitized wall rock also indicates the little importance of chlorine as gold transporting

agent. Sulfur, and not chlorine, compounds must have dominated the gold transporting complexes in the

Bloco do Butiá gold area.

Key words: geochemical modeling, gold, pyrite, sulfur, fluid-rock interaction.

INTRODUCTION

Studies on gold solubility and deposition have been

conducted by several authors (e.g. Schenberger and

Barnes 1989, Hayashi and Ohmoto 1991, Gibert et

al. 1998) because of the importance of their appli-

cation in geological exploration.

This study reports the numerical results of a

simulated interaction of the mineral reactions be-

tween a fluid and the rock with gold solubility. The

aim is to relate theoretical and natural conditions of

gold deposition in the Bloco do Butiá gold mine.

The mineral deposits in the Lavras do Sul re-

gion are hosted by Neoproterozoic granitic rocks

from the Lavras do Sul Intrusive Complex (Gastal

and Lafon 1998) and by volcanogenic rocks from

the Hilário Formation. The former comprise a cen-

tral granodiorite facies, partly assimilated by alka-

line magma (perthite granite – border facies) that

generated hybrid rocks (sieno and monzogranites –

transitional facies), while the latter is formed mainly

by basic to intermediate volcanogenic rocks. The

Bloco do Butiá area is located in the perthite granite

facies occurring at the western border of the granitic

complex (Fig. 1).

The hydrothermal alteration and mineraliza-

tion occur along one hundred meters long fractures

(EW to N70?W, dipping to N in high angle), forming
centimetric to metric alteration haloes. According

to petrographic observations (Mexias et al. 2002,

2004), the hydrothermal alteration began with epi-

syenite formation associated with the leaching of

high volumes of silica through faults and fractures.

The quartz is dissolved forming vugs, increasing

rock permeability and porosity. The amphibole

changes into ferrous chlorite, which partially pre-

cipitates in these vugs. A stage of phyllic alteration,

characterized by neutral to acid fluids and which

promoted phengite + pyrite (and gold) precipitation,

occurred later in the vugs left by the dissolution of

quartz and also promoted the partial dissolution of

the previous crystallized iron-rich chlorite. Gold

concentrations in the phyllic altered rock are around

1 ppm and are mainly represented as ‘ ‘ invisible’ ’

gold in pyrite grains. Propylitization is observed as

a widespread alteration, characterized by the isovol-

umetric chloritization of amphibole in the rocks that

envelope these highly previous altered and miner-

alized portions of rock. Weathering processes may

have been responsible for a secondary concentra-

tion of gold, stimulated by the easy degradation of

this porous and permeable, previously altered and

phyllosilicate-rich rock.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Gammons and Williams-Jones (1997), when study-

ing the gold mobility in porphyry-epithermal sys-

tems, observed that at very high temperatures

(? 500?C) gold is dissolved mainly as AuCl?2 com-
plexes showing that its solubility decreases con-

stantly with cooling. At lower temperatures, the

authors demonstrated that the dominant complexes

change mainly to Au(HS)?2 . They stress that the
transition temperature of the chloride-bissulphite

complexes as main gold transport agents depends

on pH and on the H2S/Cl ratio of the original fluid,

as well as the occurrence or not of boiling in the

hydrothermal system.

In our study, assumptions on the factors that

can control the gold deposition were tested by using

the EQ3/6 software package (Wolery 1983, Wolery

and Daveler 1992).

EQ3 performs the chemical speciation of an

aqueous solution. It distributes each element of

the solution in stable aqueous species, calculates

the activity coefficients of water and of the aqueous

species, the gas fugacity, and calculates the satura-

tion index of the solution with respect to all phases

considered in the database. EQ6 models the mass

transfer in a solid-solution-gas system. It approxi-

mates irreversible reactions by a succession of small

reaction steps. At each step it reacts small amounts

of reactants (minerals, aqueous species, or gas), cal-

culates the new composition of the solution, the fu-

gacity of gases, and models the precipitation condi-

tions of over-saturations.

Three kinds of quantitative information can be

generated:

– The chemical force, which drives a given reac-

tion (Gibbs Free Energy of the system);

– The nature of the stable paragenesis as a func-

tion of the temperature and chemical parame-

ters;

– The time required to reach thermodynamic

equilibrium as a function of the specified ki-

netic laws.

i. The assumed changes of modeling conditions

describe a chemical disequilibrium between the

rock and the fluid.

ii. The amount of dissolved primary phases or pre-

cipitated secondary minerals required to reach

another state of equilibrium was calculated.

iii. The number of secondary phases was limited to

the starting paragenesis + magnetite and gold.

iv. The results are expressed in moles of minerals

produced or consumed by 1 kg of solution (see

Appendix).

Conditions of fluids

For the EQ3 modeling calculations, we used an

initial fluid of 0.8 molal salinity (4.8 wt% eq. NaCl)

at 300?C with an assemblage of quartz, albite,
K-feldspar, muscovite, pyrite, magnetite and gold.

This mineral paragenesis corresponds to the miner-

als formed in the rock during the gold deposition in

the phyllic alteration.

The salinity (4.8 wt% eq. NaCl) was obtained

from aqueous and aqueous-carbonic fluid inclusion

data (Mexias 2000, unpublished data). The temper-

ature was set at 300?C as this is the minimum crys-
tallization temperature for minerals of hydrothermal

origin based on chlorite geothermometry and ho-

mogenization temperature from fluid inclusions in

quartz grains.

Even if chlorite crystallization is previous to

gold deposition in phyllic alteration and the fluid

inclusions are in quartz grains near the mineralized

(phyllic altered) portions the data is useful in the

sense that this temperature is usually reported in ac-

tive geothermal systems.

Thus, system is balanced after changing sev-

eral physicochemical parameters such as tempera-

ture, pH and salinity.

The initial gold saturation allows identifying

any parameters, which will promote gold deposition

in a subsequent modeling step.

In these calculations, the hydrolysis constants

of the minerals generated by SUPCRT (Helgeson

et al. 1981), were used in combination with the

dissociation constants of Au(HS)?2 , HAu(HS)
0
2 and

Au(HS)0 derived by Benchekroun et al. (1996) from

thermodynamic properties reported in Schenberger

and Barnes (1989) and Hayashi and Ohmoto (1991).

The activity coefficients were calculated by using

an extended Debuy-Huckel model. The raw data of

these results are listed in the Appendix.

RESULTS

GOLD SPECIATION WITH PH

The modeling of change of gold speciation with pH

was also calculated. Figure 2A shows that with de-

creasing pH, Au(HS)0 became the principal com-

plexing species of gold. According to figure 2B, the

proportion of free gold also increases with decreas-

ing pH. Thus, for a given Au concentration, sulfide

and metallic gold will precipitate when the pH de-

creases. These results agree with those obtained by

Gibert et al. (1998) when studying gold solubility

and its speciation in hydrothermal solutions. The

authors showed that when the temperature lies be-

tween 250 and 400?C, the main complexing species
of gold is Au(HS)0, while when the pH is &gt; 5.5, the

principal complexing species of gold is Au(HS)?2 .

FLUID REACTION WITH THE MINERALS AT

DIFFERENT CONDITIONS OF T (C? ), H+ , (OH)?
AND KCL ADDITION

Next, an assemblage of quartz, albite, K-feldspar,

muscovite, ± pyrite was put in contact with the fluid
previously established. The following conditions

were modeled with EQ6.

Temperature variation

The temperature decrease was modeled from 300?

to 200?C (Fig. 3). Figures 3A and 3B show the
evolution of the fluid components in contact with

the mineral paragenesis while figures 4A and 4B

present the results of the behavior of this paragenesis

and the magnitude of gold deposition. The pH does

not vary considerably, increasing from 5.5 (300?C)

to only 5.84 (200?C), when a certain buffering has
been observed.

The fluid shows a decrease in the concentra-

tions of sulfur and f O2. The potassium content in

the solution also decreased, while that of sodium

increased (Fig. 3A and B). Potassium is consumed

in the crystallization of K-feldspar and sodium goes

to the solution due to the destabilization of albite

(Fig. 4A). The dissolution of albite and the precipita-

tion of K-feldspar, quartz and minor pyrite occurred

in all phases of temperature variation. These reac-

tions allow the deposition of gold (Fig. 4B), which

also occurs associated with variations in other sec-

ondary reactions. The sulfur in the solution migrates

and forms small quantities of pyrite (+0.18g), which

can only occur if a small concentration of chlorite is

also consumed to supply the required iron (– 0.214g).

If chlorite does not participate in the reaction, pyrite

will not precipitate. Therefore, more sulfur will re-

main in the solution to keep the gold complexed

which, in turn, means that gold will not precipitate

(see Appendix).

In the modeled conditions the presence of fer-

rous chlorite is a fundamental condition for gold pre-

cipitation under decreasing temperature.

Acidification and alkalization

When keeping the temperature at 300?C, the min-
eral paragenesis is balanced with the starting fluid

under conditions of progressive acidification (H+)
and alkalization (OH?).

In the case of acidification, the addition of H+

does not alter the pH due to the buffering of the

mineral paragenesis. Figures 5A, 5B and 5C show

the behavior of the fluid compounds and mineral

paragenesis after the addition of H+. Significant
variations of K+ and Na+ were not observed (see
Appendix), which is important to buffer the system.

Figure 5A shows a small decrease in f O2 and in

S2 and SO2 concentrations. The changes observed

in the mineral paragenesis (Fig. 5B) show that the

deposition of chlorite consumes iron from pyrite,

which is thus slightly destabilized; muscovite is par-

tially dissolved, supplying potassium to crystallize

small amounts of K-feldspar; quartz is slightly dis-

solved, supplying silica needed in the previous reac-

tions; a very small dissolution of albite also provides

silica for the previous reactions as well as aluminum

for chlorite precipitation; sodium goes to the solu-

tion causing a small enrichment in this element (see

Appendix).

Due to the partial dissolution of pyrite, the

fluid is enriched in sulfur, which associated with ex-

cess hydrogen leads to H2S enrichment in the fluid

(Fig. 5C). These reactions are stimulated by the addi-

tion of H+ at 300?C and do not result in gold deposi-
tion probably because of pH buffering by the mineral

paragenesis and by the absence of pyrite precipita-

tion, which would stimulate the break-down of gold

complexes from the sulfur species.

When the solution is alkalized by the addition

of OH?, deposition of gold is also observed and,
in this case, the pH (? 5.5) seems to be buffered
by the mineral paragenesis. There are no changes

in concentrations of components and in f O2 of the

fluid (see Appendix).

Figures 6A and 6B show the changes of min-

eral paragenesis (volume and weight variation) dur-

ing alkalization. The results indicate that the min-

erals react with each other, with chlorite and K-

feldspar being consumed, whereas quartz and mus-

covite precipitate. While pyrite (and albite) remains

unchanged, the iron released by the dissolution of

chlorite is used for magnetite formation (Fig. 6A

and 6B).

Finally, the addition of H+ or OH? seems not
to affect the stability of gold as the pH is buffered

by the mineral paragenesis.

KCl addition

In order to evaluate the salinity variation, KCl was

added to the fluid, which was alkalized by the ad-

dition of (OH)?. The addition of KCl modifies the
cation activity ratio and decreases pH, leading to the

precipitation of gold.

The variations of the fluid components are

shown in Table I. The pH decreases (it acidifies:

from ? 5.5 to ? 4.74). The variation of f O2, SO2
and S2 is smaller and it occurs when Log mol (OH)

?

is zero (1 mol). Nevertheless, H2S increases from

0.12 to 0.13 under these conditions; K+ shows high
enrichment and Na+ has a slight increase. The ad-
dition of KCl obviously leads to potassium enrich-

ment, which will be used in K-feldspar crystalliza-

tion. In this case, albite is unstable and is dissolved,

releasing sodium to the solution (Fig. 7A). These

reactions are enhanced with decreasing pH.

Minor reactions occur with other minerals of

the paragenesis (Fig. 7B). The modeling begins

(Log mol of (OH)? from – 4 to – 3) with a partial dis-
solution of chlorite and pyrite. Magnetite is added

to balance iron. Quartz and muscovite content in-

creases, balancing the decrease of albite and the

enrichment of K-feldspar with the alkalization en-

hancement (Fig. 7A). Pyrite shows relative enrich-

ment, in opposite direction to magnetite, which

is depleted. Quartz, muscovite and chlorite are

strongly depleted when Log mol of (OH)? goes from
?1 to 0.

The behavior of precipitated gold follows that

of pyrite (Fig. 7C), decreasing abruptly when Log

mol of (OH)? goes from ?4 to ?3 and increasing
again until Log mol of (OH)? = 0. Consequently,
Au+ in solution decreases. In this case, the decrease
of pH and the deposition of pyrite also seem to stim-

ulate gold precipitation.

When comparing these results to conditions

found in nature, we are able to associate the model-

ing with the crystallization of the potassic mineral

(phengite) and the dissolution of albite, as well as the

acidification with the deposition of auriferous pyrite.

In this case, there seems to be a certain relation be-

tween the modeled conditions and the petrographic

evolution of hydrothermalism. The main difference

is that instead of forming K-feldspar as in the mod-

eling, the potassic mineral phase that crystallizes in

the altered rock is phengite.

REACTION OF THE FLUID WITH A DIFFERENT

PARAGENESIS

This reaction represents the dissolution of Fe-

chlorite by a Fe-poor fluid. Gold precipitates with

pyrite in response to the decrease of aqueous sulfide.

The reaction of the starting fluid balanced with

an iron rich biotite (annite) was simulated in the

absence as well as in the presence of pyrite (Ta-

ble II). The precipitation of gold is higher in the

absence than in the presence of pyrite, and there is

a great consumption of magnetite, which releases

iron. Gold precipitates in the presence of pyrite in

response to a decrease of aqueous sulfides, while

during the absence of pyrite, the reason for gold pre-

cipitation, i. e. the drop in solubility, is probably the

consumption of magnetite (iron for annite) and the

decrease of f O2, S2 and SO2. It seems that in this

case the variation in the state of oxidation influenced

the gold deposition.

This experiment shows the importance of the

silicate phases controlling gold solubility. In the

Bloco do Butiá mine biotite is rare and its role in

gold deposition is only theoretical.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

These results show that the processes that led to the

deposition of gold are those related to the decrease

of temperature and the addition of KCl (causing pH

decrease). This decrease in pH showed to be funda-

mental to gold deposition with sulfur species. The

results, when compared with observations in nat-

ural samples (presence of phengite and auriferous

pyrite), suggest that the decrease of pH and temper-

ature could stimulate gold precipitation from sulfur

complexes. The addition of KCl is hardly accept-

able since no chlorine was detected in phengite (Ta-

ble III). However, all calculations of the geochem-

ical mass balance had to admit the gain of some

potassium in the phyllic alteration, which is the nat-

ural stage of gold deposition associated with pyrite.

The precipitation of pyrite may have been strongly

influenced by iron available from the dissolution of

ferrous chlorite by the fluids responsible for phen-

gite deposition.

The low salinities of fluid inclusions in quartz

grains of the propylitized wall rock also testify

against the importance of chlorine as an agent of gold

transport. Therefore, sulfur, and not chlorine, com-

pounds must have dominated the gold complexes.

This dependence of the composition of the

sulfur transport complexes from temperature could

explain why our theoretical modeling evidenced

a greater importance of sulfur, and not chlorine,

at 300?C.

realizado um modelamento geoquímico deposicional para

ouro e comparado com dados geológicos, petrográficos,

geoquímicos e de inclusões fluidas da mina de ouro do

Bloco do Butiá, Lavras do Sul/RS. O ouro ocorre na

estrutura da pirita (ouro invisível) associado a mica

branca (fengita) na alteração fílica. Foi demonstrado

que os processos que levam à deposição do ouro são aque-

les relacionados ao decréscimo da temperatura e ao abai-

xamento do pH. O pH também mostrou ser fundamen-

tal para a deposição do ouro com as espécies de enxo-

aceitação como causa da precipitação do ouro visto que

não foi identificado Cl? na fengita, apesar de que em to-
dos os cálculos de balanço geoquímico de massa sempre

foi necessário admitir a entrada de um pouco de potássio

deve ter sido fortemente influenciada pela disponibilidade
