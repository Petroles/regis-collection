RESUMO 
 
 

Tese de Doutorado 
 

Samuel William Murphy 
 
 

O monitoramento de vulcões é necessário para a mitigação do perigo que apresentam à  sociedade. Esse 
monitoramento pode ser feito em uma escala global através de satélites.  Foi com essa finalidade que este 
doutorado visou desenvolver metodologias para o monitoramento das atividades termais dos vulcões 
observados do espaço. Chegou-se a isso  atravé do uso de um variedade de sensores infravermelhos 
orbitais. Foi utilizado o sensor Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer 
(ASTER), que oferece imagens de moderada a alta resolução espacial (30 – 90 m)  no infravermelho das 
ondas curtas (SWIR) e infravermelho termal (TIR), a fim de caracterizar o tamanho e a intensidade das 
anomalias termais. As bandas do TIR do ASTER conseguiram  detectar anomalias  súteis, o que permitiu 
a observação de novos precursores termais antes das erupções. O Moderate Resolution Imaging 
Spectroradiometer (MODIS) oferece imagens de alta resolução temporal (i.e. cobertura global diária), por 
isto foi utilizado para investigar atividade termal através do tempo. A análise de wavelets foi utilizado para 
quantificar os periodos de oscilação de tal atividade. Hyperion é um espectroradiômetro imageador e foi 
utilizado para demonstrar uma nova metodologia para calcular fluxo radiante de alvos termalmente 
heterogêneos (i.e. vulcões). Essas metodologias utilizam as melhores resoluções de cada um dos sensors: 
espacial (ASTER), temporal (MODIS) , espectral (Hyperion) podem ser automaticamente executadas  em 
escala global. Essa tese visa portanto apresentar uma fundação sólida onde futuros sistemas de 
monitoramento de vulcões podem ser baseados.

INFRARED MONITORING OF VOLCANOES FROM SPACE 

 
 
 
 

ABSTRACT 
 
 
 

PhD Thesis 
 

Samuel William Murphy 
 
Volcanoes need to be monitored to mitigate the risk that they pose to society. This can be done on a global 
scale using satellite sensors. The goal of this doctorate was to develop methods for the monitoring of 
volcanic thermal activity from space. This was achieved through the use of a variety of orbital infrared 
sensors. The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), which offers 
moderate to high spatial resolution imagery (30 – 90 m) in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) and thermal 
infrared (TIR), was used to characterize the size and intensity of thermal anomalies. Its TIR channels were 
capable of detecting subtle thermal anomalies. This permitted the observation of new thermal precursors 
to eruptive events. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) offers high temporal 
resolution imagery (i.e. daily global coverage). It was therefore used to investigate thermal activity 
through time. Wavelet analysis was used to quantify the time period over which such activity oscillates. 
Hyperion is an orbiting imaging spectrometer. It was used to demonstrate a new method for calculating 
radiant flux from thermally heterogeneous targets (i.e. such as volcanoes). These methods utilized the 
strengths of each sensor system, i.e. high spatial, temporal or spectral resolution. They all improve the 
ability to detect and/or quantify thermal anomalies from space and can be executed in an automated global 
basis. This thesis therefore presents a solid foundation on which the next generation global volcano 
monitoring system can be based.

Capítulo 1 

 

Introdução 

 

 

A Terra é um sistema dinâmico. O desequilíbrio termodinâmico entre o interior e a crosta 

terrestre, leva a uma transferência de energia (calor) do interior em direção à crosta. Esta 

transferência de energia térmica em escala planetária manifesta-se mais claramente sob a forma 

de vulcões. Dada à magnitude desse processo, os vulcões desempenham múltiplas influências 

dentro do sistema terrestre e são essenciais para a compreensão do funcionamento do nosso 

planeta. 

 Ao longo da história geológica a atividade vulcânica tem provocado efeitos dramáticos 

sobre a composição da atmosfera, o clima da Terra, a extinção de espécies e a concentração de 

minerais no que, ao longo do tempo, tornou-se o que são agora corpos de minério. Os depósitos 

vulcânicos também oferecem informações valiosas sobre a dinâmica e composição interna da 

Terra através do tempo, especialmente por estes depósitos serem nossas únicas fontes de 

amostras do manto. Entretanto é evidente que a atividade vulcânica contemporânea também 

apresenta uma série de riscos para a sociedade, incluindo a perda de vidas humanas e graves 

impactos na economia e infraestrutura. 

 Grande parte dos vulcões ativos não possuem um programa de monitoramento específico, 

uma vez que as escalas de tempo vulcânicas frequentemente parecem longas quando comparadas 

às escalas de tempo humanas e os vulcões estão localizados em diferentes locais do globo. No 

entanto, existem cerca de 20 erupções ocorrendo simultaneamente e, tipicamente, cerca de 60 

erupções ocorrem por ano no mundo. Esta lacuna no monitoramento apresenta perigo e poderá 



2 
 

resultar na perda de vida e bens materias que seriam evitáveis com um monitoramento mais 

aperfeiçoado. Neste cenário, os sensores espaciais fornecem o único meio de preencher esta 

lacuna em escala global. 

 O perigo causado pela atividade vulcânica é um problema global que, direta ou 

indiretamente, afeta uma grande parte da população mundial. Considerando através de uma 

perspectiva sul-americana, vemos que a maioria da costa ocidental deste continente é ativa. Isso é 

ocasionado principalmente pela subducção da placa de Nazca sob a placa Sul-americana e tem 

implicações para todo o continente, já que áreas vastas podem ser afetadas por plumas de cinzas 

vulcânicas. Um exemplo é a erupção de 1993 do Láscar (Chile) que causou a queda de tephra 

(i.e. cinzas vulcânicas) em Porto Alegre (Brasil) apesar da distância de 1800 km. Mais 

recentemente (i.e. junho de 2011), a atividade do vulcão Puyehue (Chile) formou uma nuvem de 

cinzas que foi do Chile e atravessou a Argentina chegando até ao Oceano Atlântico (Fig. 1.1). 

  

 

Figura 1.1. Imagem de MODIS (cor verdadeira) da erupção de Puyehue (Chile) em junho 

de 2011. A nuvem de cinzas viajou NNE e depois ESE, atravessando a Argentina. Voos 

foram cancelados na Argentina, Brasil e outros países sul-americanos. 

 



3 
 

Como resultado, voos de chegada e partida do aeroporto internacional de Buenos Aires (situado 

cerca de 1400 km de distância do vulcão) foram cancelados, incluindo aqueles com embarque de 

passageiros brasileiros. A tendência é que transtornos como esses ocorram com mais frequência 

no futuro, devido à crescente densidade do tráfego aéreo na região. A consequência de tais 

atividades vulcânicas pode incluir enormes danos financeiros gerados pelo impacto adverso nos 

negócios e comércio. Um exemplo é a parada do espaço aéreo europeu por vários dias em março 

de 2010, em função da erupção do Eyjafjallajökull (Islândia). É imperativo, portanto, desenvolver 

técnicas de monitoramento através das quais seja possível desenvolver um sistema eficaz para 

minimizar os perigos causados pelas erupções. 

 O objetivo deste trabalho consistiu em explorar o uso de imagens de satélite para a 

observação e quantificação de anomalias termais vulcânicas. As metodologias desenvolvidas para 

detectar e descrever tal atividade foram projetadas para ser implementadas em um contexto de 

monitoramento. Desta forma elas podem ser executadas automaticamente por um computador e 

são globalmente aplicáveis. 

 Há uma ampla variedade na capacidade dos sensores orbitais devido à relação entre a 

resolução espacial, a temporal e a espectral. Foi investigado nesse trabalho o uso de diferentes 

tipos de sensores os quais fornecem, coletivamente, uma alta resolução em cada categoria. Isso é 

importante porque os fenômenos vulcânicos ocorrem ao longo de escalas temporais e espaciais 

extensas e cujo comportamento apresenta forte dependência do comprimento de onda. Imagens 

de alta resolução espacial podem ser utilizadas para restringir o tamanho, forma, localização e 

orientação de anomalias termais. Dados de alta resolução temporal podem ser usados para 

monitorar mudanças dinâmicas na atividade térmica e observar eventos efêmeros. A alta 

resolução espectral permite a melhor caracterização da energia radiante e oferece a possibilidade 

de realizar análises subpixel. 

 Os dados dos seguintes sistemas de sensores existentes foram utilizados na pesquisa: i) o 

Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), que fornece 

imagens de alta resolução espacial (30 m) no infravermelho de ondas curtas (SWIR, 1,5 - 3 ?m) e 

média resolução espacial (90 m) no infravermelho termal (TIR, 8-13 ?m); ii) o MODerate 

Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), que fornece imagens de alta resolução 

temporal no SWIR, no infravermelho médio (MIR, 3 - 5 ?m) e no TIR; e iii) o Hyperion, que é

da atividade vulcânica, descritos por relatórios de campo, com o objetivo de explorar o seu 

potencial como precursores de erupções. 

 O sensor ASTER é capaz de detectar anomalias termais sutis utilizando suas bandas no 

TIR. Imagens deste sensor foram usadas para quantificar o tamanho e intensidade de anomalias 

termais durante uma série de tempo decenal em uma gama de vulcões: Erebus (Antártica), Láscar 

(Chile), K?lauea (Havaí), Erta ‘Ale (Etiópia) e Kliuchevskoi (Rússia). Nos vulcões Láscar e 

Kliuchevskoi foram identificados precursores termais relacionados à atividade eruptiva. Tais 

precursores podem formar a base de futuros sistemas automatizados de alerta. 

 MODIS foi utilizado para caracterizar a atividade do Láscar, K?lauea, Erta ‘Ale e 

Kliuchevskoi. Muitas das imagens ASTER e MODIS foram adquiridas contemporaneamente, 

uma vez que os dois sensores estão a bordo do mesmo satélite (i.e. Terra). Isto permitiu explorar 

a sinergia entre os dois sensores. A atividade térmica, detectada pelo MODIS, foi descrita usando 

uma medida simples de radiância vulcânica. Foram realizadas também análises avançadas de 

séries temporais utilizando dados MODIS através de wavelets. Isso permitiu investigar a 

periodicidade na série de tempo observada, permitindo assim a quantificação do intervalo durante 

o qual a radiância aumentava e diminuía e o período de repouso entre os eventos, o que fornece 

indicações importantes sobre a probabilidade de futuras erupções (Marzocchi e Zaccarelli, 2006) 

e, portanto, sua quantificação objetiva poder contribuir para os esforços de previsão no futuro. 

 Para detectar anomalias termais é necessário quantificar o comportamento normal, bem 

como os desvios anormais. Isso exigiu o desenvolvimento de uma abordagem inovadora para a 

seleção da temperatura de background para os dados ASTER, bem como a definição de limiares 

de anomalia específicos para o MODIS. Anomalias termais em dados Hyperion foram 

identificados utilizando um limiar de radiância. Uma vez identificada uma anomalia, é 

fundamental que as métricas utilizadas para descrever a atividade vulcânica térmica sejam 

viáveis. Ao longo dos últimos 30 anos, uma grande quantidade de atenção tem sido dada à análise 

subpixel de imagens de alvos vulcânicos. Isto ocorre devido às superfícies vulcânicas ativas 

serem, com frequência, termicamente heterogêneas em relação à escala espacial de um pixel. Isso 

quer dizer que um único valor de temperatura ou radiância não descreveria toda a complexidade 

térmica de superfícies com atividades vulcânicas. 

 Neste estudo foi explorada a capacidade de espectrômetros imageadores, tais como 

Hyperion, para resolver características subpixel (i.e. o número, tamanho e temperatura das 



5 
 

componentes isotérmicas menores de um pixel). Tal objetivo foi atingido através do 

desenvolvimento de um método para a modelagem inversa do espectro de radiação, a partir do 

qual as características subpixel podem ser derivadas. Este método foi testado utilizando testes do 

tipo Monte Carlo que mostrou a precisão da metodologia desenvolvida (erros entre 3 e 5%). 

Todavia, mesmo neste nível de precisão, não foi possível resolver de forma confiável as 

características subpixel. Teoricamente a precisão do modelo, se aprimorada, poderia aumentar a 

confiabilidade nas soluções subpixel. Na prática, porém, isto não é possível devido às limitações 

na precisão de medida dos espectros de radiação. Assim, é improvável que se possa, de forma 

confiável, determinar características subpixel de imagens de vulcões ativos por meio de 

informação espectral. Tal fato tem implicações profundas, dada a extensão em que os autores 

anteriores tentaram resolver estes parâmetros durante as últimas três décadas. 

 Sendo assim, definimos uma solução alternativa. Fluxo radiante e excitância são duas 

métricas (relacionadas) que podem ser utilizadas para descrever, de forma confiável e 

significativa, a atividade térmica mesmo de superfícies com altos gradientes de temperatura. Por 

meio destes dados, desenvolvemos um método para calcular estes parâmetros que é 

computacionalmente eficiente e, portanto, rápido o suficiente para ser executado por 

computadores à bordo dos sistemas de sensores para processamento em rota. Nós fornecemos um 

exemplo prático desta abordagem utilizando dados do Hyperion de um fluxo de lava no vulcão 

Kliuchevskoi. 

 Esta tese está organizada da seguinte forma. Uma revisão fundamental de princípios 

científicos e do estado da arte é fornecida no Capítulo 2. Este é seguido por capítulos que são 

compostos de artigos que foram publicados, aceitos ou prestes a serem submetidos em revistas 

internacionais. O Capítulo 3 explora a utilização do ASTER para caracterizar o tamanho e 

intensidade das anomalias térmicas nos vulcões Láscar e Erebus. O Capítulo 4 investiga o 

desenvolvimento de uma sinergia entre ASTER e MODIS, bem como a demonstração da 

utilização da análise de wavelet em dados MODIS. O Capítulo 5 explora o uso de espectrômetros

Introduction 

 

 

The Earth is a dynamic physical system. The thermodynamic disequilibrium between the hotter 

terrestrial interior and the colder terrestrial crust leads towards a net transfer of heat energy in the 

direction of the cold space through which the planet traverses. This transfer of heat energy on a 

planetary scale manifests itself most clearly in the form of volcanoes. Given the magnitude of this 

process volcanoes play a number of influential roles within the Earth system and are integral 

towards our understanding of how the planet works. 

 Throughout geological history volcanic activity has had dramatic effects on the 

composition of the atmosphere, the climate of the Earth, the extinction of species and the 

concentration of minerals into what have now become ore bodies. Volcanic deposits also offer 

valuable insights into the dynamics and composition of the Earth through time; including our 

only samples of the mantle. Clearly, however, contemporary volcanic activity also poses a 

number of hazards to society including loss of human life and severe impacts on economy and 

infrastructure. 

 Volcanic time scales often appear long compared to human time scales, furthermore 

volcanoes are dispersed around the globe, consequently most active volcanoes have no dedicated 

monitoring program. Yet, at any one time, there are some 20 eruptions occurring simultaneously 

and there are typically around 60 eruptions per year. This perilous monitoring gap will inevitably 



8 
 

result in the avoidable loss of life and material property. Spaceborne sensors provide the only 

means at present for filling this gap on a global scale. 

 Volcanic hazard is a global issue that directly or indirectly affects a large proportion of 

the world’s population. From a South American perspective the majority of the West coast of this 

continent is volcanically active, principally due to subduction of the Nazca Plate below the South 

American Plate. This has implications for the entire continent given the truly enormous areas that 

can be affected by volcanic ash plumes. The 1993 eruption of Láscar (Chile) caused tephra (i.e. 

volcanic ash) fall-out over Porto Alegre (Brazil) some 1800 km away. More recently (i.e. June 

2011) activity at Puyehue volcano (Chile) formed an ash plume that traversed from Chile through 

Argentina into the Atlantic Ocean (Fig. 1.1). 

  

  

Figure 1.1. A MODIS true colour image of the Puyehue (Chile) eruption in June 2011. The ash 

plume is seen travelling NNE before sweeping ESE across Argentina. Flights were cancelled at 

Argentinean, Brazilian and other South-American airports. 

 

Flights, including those to be boarded by Brazilian passengers, were cancelled to and from 

Buenos Aires International Airport (i.e. situated some 1400 km away from the volcano). 

Disruptions such as these are likely to occur more frequently in the future due to the ever 



9 
 

increasing density of air-traffic in the region. The consequences of such disruptions can include 

potentially enormous financial loss through adverse affects on business and trade, as recently 

occurred after European airspace was closed for a few days in March 2010 following the eruption 

of Eyjafjallajökull (Iceland). It is therefore imperative to develop monitoring techniques upon 

which effective hazard mitigation strategy can be based. 

 The aim of this thesis is to explore the use of infrared imagery from satellite sensors for 

the observation and quantification of volcanic thermal anomalies. The methodologies developed 

to detect and describe such activity have been designed for implementation in a monitoring 

context; thus they can be executed automatically by a computer and are globally applicable. This 

thesis therefore works towards improving the global volcano monitoring system. 

 Orbital sensors have a wide variety of capabilities that are borne out of a trade-off 

between spatial, temporal and spectral resolution. Image data from a single sensor system might 

therefore have a high resolution in up to two of these categories; but not all three. This is 

primarily due to limitations in existing imaging technology and data transfer rates. I investigated 

the use of different sensor types that collectively provide high resolution in each category. This is 

of importance because volcanic phenomena occur over wide temporal and spatial scales and 

exhibit strong wavelength dependent behaviour. High spatial resolution images can be used to 

constrain the size, shape, location and orientation of thermal anomalies. High temporal resolution 

data can be used to monitor dynamic changes in thermal activity as well as to observe ephemeral 

events, and high spectral resolution allows radiant energy to be better characterized, and offers 

the possibility to carry out advanced subpixel analysis. 

 Data from the following existing sensor systems were utilised in this research: i) the 

Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), which provided 

high spatial resolution imagery in the Short-Wave InfraRed (i.e. SWIR, 1.5 - 3 ?m) and moderate 

spatial resolution imagery in the Thermal InfraRed (i.e. TIR, 8 - 13 ?m); ii) the MODerate 

Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), which provided high temporal resolution 

imagery in the SWIR, mid wave infrared (i.e. MIR, 3 - 5 ?m) and TIR; and iii) Hyperion which is 

a SWIR imaging spectrometer. The data from these separate sensor systems were analyzed in the 

context of volcanic activity, as described by field reports, and with the aim of exploring their 

potential as eruptive precursors. 



10 
 

 The ASTER sensor was capable of detecting subtle thermal anomalies using its TIR 

bands. Images from this sensor were used to quantify the size and intensity of thermal anomalies 

over a decadal time series at a range of volcanoes, namely: Erebus (Antarctica), Láscar (Chile), 

K?lauea (Hawai'i), Erta ‘Ale (Ethiopia) and Kliuchevskoi (Russia). Thermal precursors to 

eruptive activity were identified at Láscar and Kliuchevskoi, such precursors might form the 

basis of future automated alert systems. 

 MODIS was used to characterize activity at Láscar, K?lauea, Erta ‘Ale and Kliuchevskoi. 

Many of the ASTER and MODIS images were acquired contemporaneously as both sensors are 

on board the same satellite (i.e. Terra). This allowed a synergy between the two sensors to be 

explored. Thermal activity, as seen by MODIS, was described using a straightforward metric of 

volcanic radiance. Advanced time series analysis was carried out on the MODIS data sets through 

the use of wavelets. This allowed periodicity in the time series to be investigated, allowing the 

quantification of the period over which thermal activity waxed and waned, as well as the length 

of repose between events, to be defined. Waxing, waning and repose provide important 

indications on the probability of future eruptions (Marzocchi and Zaccarelli, 2006) and therefore 

their objective quantification may contribute to forecasting efforts in the future. 

 In order to detect thermal anomalies it is necessary to be able to quantify normal 

behaviour as well as abnormal deviations from it. This required that we develop an innovative 

approach to background temperature selection for ASTER data as well as to define volcano 

specific anomaly thresholds for MODIS. Anomalies in Hyperion data were defined using a 

simple radiance threshold. Once an anomaly has been identified it is critical that the metrics used 

to describe volcanic thermal activity are both reliable and meaningful. Over the last 30 years a 

great deal of attention has been paid to the subpixel analysis of imagery from volcanic targets. 

This is because active volcanic surfaces are often thermally heterogeneous at the pixel scale. A 

single radiance or temperature value will therefore not capture the full thermal complexity of 

active volcanic surfaces. 

 I explored the ability of imaging spectrometers, such as Hyperion, to resolve subpixel 

characteristics (i.e. the number, size and temperature of isothermal subpixel components) at 

volcanic targets. This was achieved by developing a method for inverse modelling of radiance 

spectra from which subpixel characteristics could be derived. This method was tested using a 

Monte Carlo approach. Radiance spectra could be accurately modelled, i.e. to within 3 - 5 %. 



11 
 

However, even at this level of accuracy, it was not possible to reliably resolve subpixel 

characteristics. Theoretically improved model fitting accuracy could allow for more reliable 

subpixel characteristics solutions. However, in practice, this is probably not possible due to 

limitations in the accuracy to which radiance spectra can be measured in the first place. Thus, it is 

improbably that we can reliably determine subpixel characteristics of imagery from active 

volcanoes using spectral information alone. This has profound implications given the extent to 

which previous authors have attempted to resolve such parameters over the last three decades.  

 We advocate an alternative solution. Radiant flux and radiant exitance are two (related) 

metrics that can both be used to reliably and meaningfully describe thermal activity even from 

surfaces with strong temperature gradients. We developed a method for calculating these 

parameters that is computationally efficient, and therefore fast, enough to be executed by 

computers on-board sensor systems for on-the-fly processing. We provide a practical example of 

this approach using data from Hyperion, producing maps of radiant flux of an active lava flow at 

Kliuchevskoi volcano. 

 This thesis is organized in the following way. A fundamental review of scientific 

principals and context is provided in Chapter 2. This is followed by chapters that are comprised 

of articles that have been either published in, accepted by or about to be submitted to 

international, peer-reviewed journals. Chapter 3 explores the use of ASTER to characterize the 

size and intensity of thermal anomalies at Láscar and Erebus, Chapter 4 investigates the 

development of a synergy between ASTER and MODIS as well as demonstrating a use of 

wavelet analysis on MODIS data, Chapter 5 explores the use of imaging spectrometers to 

calculate radiant flux and makes the case against subpixel analysis at volcanic targets. Chapter 6 

looks to the future of infrared remote sensing of volcanoes from space and provides an overall 

conclusion.

Scientific Context 

 

 

 

2.1. Observing Volcanoes from Space 

 

Satellites provide many advantages over field-based techniques when observing volcanic 

behaviour. These include: global coverage, a synoptic perspective of a scene, continuity of data 

collection, almost zero exposure of people and equipment to volcanic hazards, and typically a 

much lower cost of data acquisition for the end user.  

There are two principal orbits used by Earth observation satellites (Fig. 2.1); those that 

traverse around the Earth's poles (i.e. polar orbit) and those that stay within the plane of the 

Earth’s equator whilst completing an orbit in a 24 hour period thus point continuously towards 

the same face of the Earth (i.e. geostationary).  

Polar orbits have relatively low altitudes (&amp;lt;1000 km) and are sun-synchronous (i.e. they 

pass the equator at the same time of day and night). Within the typical altitude range of a polar 

orbiting satellite (i.e. 550 - 850 km) the orbit period will take 99 ± 4 minutes. This translates into 

about 14.5 orbits per day. Polar orbiters are able to provide global coverage because of the 

rotation of the Earth.  



14 
 

Geostationary satellites, on the other hand, are situated at much high altitude (i.e. 35,770 

km) in order to obtain the required 24 hour orbit period. Clearly a single geostationary satellite 

cannot image the Earth’s entire surface. However a constellation of at least 5 satellites, separated 

by 60
o
 of longitude, could provide global coverage of equatorial regions (Mouginis-Mark and 

Domergue-Schmidt 2000). Even so such a geostationary constellation will inevitable suffer 

severe distortion beyond ~50
o
 from the sub satellite point due to the curvature of the Earth and 

will also be incapable of imaging the poles. 

 

 

Figure 2.1. A schematic of polar and geostationary orbits. 

 

An imaging sensor contains an array of detector elements; this is often referred to as a ‘focal 

plane array’. The response from each detector element will typically correspond to a single 

picture element (i.e. pixel) within an image. The angular cone of visibility of each detector 

element is known as its instantaneous field of view (i.e. IFOV). The area on the Earth's surface to 

which a single pixel corresponds is proportional to the IFOV of the detector element and the 

altitude of the satellite. This area is typically assumed to be well represented by discrete, non-

overlapping rectangles, as this greatly facilitates computational processing and visualization of 

image data. The size of the rectangular area on the ground to which a single pixel corresponds is 

the standard way of expressing spatial resolution. The smaller the pixel size the higher the spatial 

resolution. In reality the IFOVs of detector elements are not rectangular and they do overlap. This 

can present issues when imaging hot targets with strong thermal gradients (e.g. Chapter 5). The 

geographical width of the area imaged by an entire focal plane array is known as the swath width. 

This width, as well as the orbital period of a satellite, controls the temporal frequency of polar 

orbiters (i.e. the time taken to acquire consecutive images of the same part of the Earth's surface). 



15 
 

Conversely, the temporal frequency of geostationary satellites is controlled solely by their data 

acquisition and transfer rate, typically providing a new image of the same portion of the Earth 

every 15 - 30 minutes.  

 Satellite sensors are often classified based on their spatial and temporal resolution. At the 

time of writing images with pixel sizes smaller than somewhere between 30 to 100 m are usually 

considered to be of high spatial resolution. Revisit periods of less than one day are considered to 

be high temporal resolution. Images with a pixel size of around 1 km or more are considered to 

be of low spatial resolution. Revisit periods of more than a couple of weeks constitute a low 

temporal resolution. Spectral capabilities are usually classified depending on whether a sensor 

system has a single, typically quite wide, waveband (panchromatic), more than one waveband 

(multispectral), or more than one hundred wavebands, in this case often referred to as 'channels' 

(hyperspectral). There exists the possibility that hyperspectral sensors will become known as 

imaging spectrometers. The wide variety of spatial, temporal and spectral information captured 

by current and past orbital sensors has been creatively adopted by the volcano monitoring 

community over the years. The predominant themes are discussed below. 

 

2.1.1. Thermal Emission 

 

It is possible to monitor the central driving force of volcanic activity (i.e. heat transfer) directly 

from space by measuring radiated electromagnetic energy. The first recorded observation of 

thermal volcanic activity from space was from the High Resolution Infrared Radiometer (HRIS) 

on board the Nimbus 1 (Gawarecki et al. 1965). Since then there have been a number of satellites 

used to observe thermal emissions from volcanoes (Table 2.1). 

 Nimbus 1 was a geostationary satellite; the HRIR sensor acquired imagery using 70mm 

film strips that were digitized for transmission back to Earth, using a facsimile scanner (i.e. an 

apparatus that determines changes in tone density). Focal plane arrays have now superseded 

facsimile imagers. Modern geostationary satellites include those in NASA's Geostationary 

Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) series. The imager on GOES-8 (i.e. launched in 

1994) was the first in this satellite series to have a mid infrared (i.e. MIR; 3 - 5 ?m) channel. MIR 

wavelengths are crucial for detecting thermal anomalies at such a low spatial resolution (i.e. 4 

km). Co-registered thermal infrared (i.e. TIR; 8 - 12 ?m) imagery is often used to improve 



16 
 

detection capability as, given that they are insensitive to volcanic thermal phenomenon at such 

spatial resolutions, they can provide an indication of background conditions (e.g. Harris et al. 

1997). The GOES series is principally intended to provide meteorological data. The demand for 

reliable up-to-date weather forecasts has resulted in the construction and launch of an ever 

evolving constellation of meteorological satellites. ESA's Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) 

series, which cover Europe and Africa, have included the Spinning Enhanced Visible and 

Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) since 2002. SEVIRI has a 4 and 11 ?m channel with a temporal 

resolution of 15 minutes and a pixel size of 3 km. The Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) 

launched the first of the Multi-Functional Transport Satellite series (MTSAT) in 2005. It provides 

coverage of Asia and Australasia and has 3.7 and 10.8 ?m channel with a 4 km spatial resolution. 

Global equatorial geostationary coverage is therefore a reality and appears likely to remain so for 

the foreseeable future.  

 

Table 2.1. Orbital sensors used for infrared observations of volcanoes 

 

 

For truly global coverage it is necessary to use polar orbiting satellites. Large swath width polar 

orbiters (i.e. ~3000 km) are capable of acquiring daily images at equatorial latitudes and even 

more frequently towards the poles due to orbit convergence. High temporal resolution polar 

orbiters typically have pixel sizes of around 1 km. The Advanced Very-High Resolution 

Radiometer (AVHRR) was the first to measure in the MIR and also freely transmits data to 



17 
 

anyone with a receiving station. The Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) has been using 

AVHRR to monitor volcanoes at the Alaskan peninsula, the Aleutian Islands and the 

Kamchatkan peninsula since 1994. This has included the development of algorithms that 

automatically detect thermal anomalies and produce up-to-date visual representations of target 

volcanoes (e.g. Dean et al. 1996). The Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR), launched on 

board the second European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS - 2) in 1995 and de-orbited in June 

2011, provided similar data to that of AVHRR but with an additional 1.6 ?m channel to further 

constrain spectral radiance from hot, spatially extensive targets. It was not until the launch of the 

Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) however, i.e. in December 1999, that 

a truly global volcano thermal monitoring system could be developed. The first, and currently 

only, of which was MODVOLC. This monitoring system automatically scans MODIS data for 

hotspots and, when found, records their location, time and radiant intensity. NASA Goddard 

Space Flight Center sends these algorithm outputs to the University of Hawaii every 5 minutes 

which, in turn, are made available on the MODVOLC website (modis.higp.hawaii.edu). The most 

recent addition to the fleet of high temporal resolution polar orbiters is the Suomi NPP
1
. It was 

successfully launched on 28 October 2011. The sensor on board Suomi NPP which can be 

used to monitor volcanic thermal activity is the Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite 

(VIIRS). It provides high temporal resolution (0.5 day revisit) imagery at a pixel size of 375 - 

750 m.  

 High spatial resolution data are available from polar orbit given their proximity to the 

Earth. Thermal observations of volcanoes at high spatial resolution first became available with 

the launch of the Landsat 4 and 5 (launched in 1982 and 1984, respectively) which contained the 

Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor. Landsat 7, launched in 1999, also provided data from the 

Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+). These sensors each provided two SWIR channels at 

30 m pixel resolution and a coarse TIR channel (i.e. 120 m/pixel for the TM and 60 m/pixel for

 The Suomi NPP mission was originally called just 'NPP' (i.e. NPOESS Preparatory Project), where 

'NPOESS' was the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System. The NPOESS 

program was dissolved on 1 February 2010 into separate civilian and military components.  The civilian 

component is now under the jurisdiction of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) 

and has been renamed the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS). The acronym NPP has been changed 

accordingly; it now signifies 'National Polar-orbiting Partnership'.

the ETM+). The Landsat series have been used to investigate several volcanic phenomena, 

including: lava flows, lava lakes, volcanic domes, fumarole fields, Strombolian vents, and warm 

crater lakes (e.g. Flynn et al. 2000). The launch of the ASTER sensor on the Terra satellite in 

December 1999 (i.e. the same satellite that carried the first MODIS sensor) provided an 

unprecedented number of high spatial resolution channels, with 6 in the SWIR and 5 in the TIR. 

Particular focus has been paid to utilizing the TIR bands to obtain surface temperature estimates, 

e.g. Ramsey &amp;amp; Dehn (2004), Pieri &amp;amp; Abrams (2005), Vaughan &amp;amp; Hook (2006), Vaughan et. al. 

(2008), and Carter and Ramsey (2009), but also to explore the potential for subpixel analysis 

(Vaughan et al. 2010). 

 Earth Observing 1 (i.e. EO-1) was also launched around the turn of the millennium (i.e. 

November 2000). It contained Hyperion, the first ever orbital imaging spectrometer. The extra 

spectral resolution allowed more advanced subpixel analysis to be carried out (section 2.5.). The 

use of high spatial (i.e. ASTER), high temporal (i.e. MODIS) and high spectral (i.e. Hyperion) 

resolution satellites for monitoring thermal activity from volcanoes is the main thrust of this 

thesis and is discussed in more detail in the following chapters. 

 

2.1.2. Gas Plumes 

 

The primary mechanism by which heat energy is transferred to the Earth's surface from volcanic 

systems is through the movement of volatiles (i.e. predominantly water as well as some CO2). 

Measuring water and CO2 fluxes from space is not trivial, largely because of their high 

concentration in the atmosphere. Potential breakthroughs in CO2 detection may arise from use of 

the Japanese Greenhouse gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) or the planned second Orbiting 

Carbon Observer mission (OCO-2). In contrast SO2 has a low atmospheric concentration which 

makes it relatively simple to detect using diagnostic absorption features in the UV (~0.3 ?m), 

TIR (~8.6 ?m) and even microwave (~1469 ?m) wavelengths. Observation of SO2 plumes from 

space using UV wavelengths has been ongoing since Krueger (1983) first discovered anomalies 

in ozone retrievals following the eruption of El Chichón (Mexico). The Total Ozone Mapping 

Spectrometer (TOMS) was used in initial studies; other sensors with a pertinent UV channel for 

SO2 observation and/or quantification include the: Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 

(GOME), GOME-2, SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric 



19 
 

CHartographY (SCIAMACHY), Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Ozone Mapping and 

Profiler Suite (OMPS) (e.g. Hooper et al. 2012). The use of the TIR absorption feature to obtain 

SO2 retrievals began with the High Resolution Infrared Sounder (HRIS) (Prata et al. 2003) and 

was followed by uses of ASTER, MODIS, AIRS and IASI for this purpose (Prata et al. 2012). 

Measurements of volcanic SO2 from space using microwave wavelengths have been 

demonstrated by Read et al. (1993) using data from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS). 

However the extremely low spatial resolution of this sensor (~ 30-150 km) limit its practical 

applicability. 

 

2.1.3. Ash Clouds 

 

Explosive eruptions can produce large quantities of fragmented pyroclastic material. Hot ash-rich 

eruption clouds can often reach heights of 10 km or more and spread out laterally for thousands 

of kilometres. Satellites provide the only means of directly observing the entirety of such 

extensive features. Ash related hazards include respiratory problems, roof collapse and a potential 

for ash deposits to remobilize as lahars (i.e. volcanic mudflows). Unfortunately societal 

vulnerability to volcanic ash is increasing due to the growing number of people and cargo that are 

transported by air. This is because modern jet engines operate at temperatures that melt silicate-

rich minerals, this can cause engine failure by the melting and solidification of ash within the 

turbine. The eruptions of Galunggung, Java (June 1982); Redoubt, USA (December 1989) and 

Pinatubo, Philippines (June 1991) all resulted in severe damage to passenger jets with repair costs 

running into the millions of US dollars (Miller &amp;amp; Casadevall 2000). Fortunately no lives were 

lost even though aircraft plummeted by as much as 7500 m in 16 minutes after ingesting ash and 

subsequently stalling (Miller &amp;amp; Casadevall 2000). These instances provided a strong motivation 

for the identification and quantification of volcanic ash plumes using satellites. Prata (1989) 

showed that a 10 and 12 ?m channel could be used to differentiate between ash clouds and 

water/ice based on their brightness temperature difference. Examples of volcanic ash retrievals 

include uses of MODIS (Watson et al. 2004), AIRS (Hooper et al. 2012) and SEVIRI (Prata &amp;amp; 

Prata 2012) sensors. 

  



20 
 

2.1.4. Geometry 

 

The geometry of a volcano is an extremely important control on the direction and distance 

travelled by a hazardous flow (e.g. pyroclastic flow, lava flow, debris avalanche or lahar). Digital 

elevation models (DEM) therefore form the basis for hazardous flow models (e.g. TITAN 2D, 

Pitman et al. 2003). The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), carried out during February 

of 2000, provided a DEM at spatial resolution of 30 m for all terrestrial surfaces between 56
o
 S 

and 60
o
 N. As of June 2009 a global DEM, created using ASTER’s stereoscopic viewing 

capability, was released to the public (i.e. ASTER GDEM). It also offers 30 m spatial resolution. 

Volcanic edifices can expand and contract in response to pressure variations from the flux 

of magma and volatiles in a volcanic system. Centimetre scale changes in the geometry of a 

volcanic edifice can be imaged from space using synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR). 

The principle behind InSAR is that phase changes in two separate synthetic aperture radar (SAR) 

images, taken of the same location but at different times, provides information on the change in 

distance between the satellite and the target surface. It is assumed that the scattering properties of 

the ground remain fairly constant between acquisitions, thus variable snow and ice cover and/or 

dense vegetation can be problematic. Even so, many studies have been successfully carried out to 

show quantitative observations of topographic changes that have been attributed to, for example, 

magma chamber dynamics (e.g. Lu et al. 2000, Fialko &amp;amp; Simons 2001, Pritchard &amp;amp; Simons 2002, 

Wicks et al. 2006), sill and dike intrusion (e.g. Jónsson et al. 1999, Fukushima et al. 2005, 

Pedersen &amp;amp; Sigmundsson 2006) and faulting (Amelung et al. 2000). Currently the TerraSAR-X 

and COSMO-SkyMed satellite constellations provide 11 and 4 day temporal resolution 

respectively. ESA’s Sentinel-1 satellites (i.e. launch in 2013 and 2014) will further increase the 

frequency at which terrestrial SAR images are acquired.

2.1.5. Mapping eruptive products 

 

High spatial resolution polar orbiters with infrared wavebands can be used to map thermally 

anomalous surfaces. Landsat 4 and 5 have been used to map the distribution of cooling lava flows 

(e.g. Flynn et al. 1994) and locate the surface expression of active underground lava tubes (e.g. 

Harris et al. 1998). The TIR bands of the ASTER sensor facilitated the detection of more subtle 

thermal anomalies from pyroclastic flows and lava domes (e.g. Carter &amp;amp; Ramsey 2009).  

 

2.2. Physical Principles 

 

Energy is an abstract quantity which seems to be constant during all physical interactions. This 

characteristic has resulted in it becoming a fundamental concept in our understanding of the 

observable universe. Energy is required to make, move and change matter. All matter with a 

temperature above absolute zero will radiate electromagnetic energy. This radiant energy displays 

a wave-particle duality and is therefore modelled as both electromagnetic waves and physical 

particles (i.e. photons). The energy associated with a single photon can be expressed as: 

 

   
  

 
 (2.1) 

 

where h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10
?34

 J s), c is the speed of light in a vacuum 

(2.998 x 10
8
 m s

-1
) and   is the photon wavelength in metres. The SI unit of energy is Joules. We 

are usually concerned with multiple photons. The total energy (Q) from a wave train or burst of 

radiant energy is the sum of all photon energies (qi) in that burst 

 

      

 

   

 (2.2) 

 

The rate of photon energy transfer is known as the radiant flux (?)  

 

 ?        (2.3) 



22 
 

It is often necessary to quantify the radiant flux per unit area of a plane surface. This quantity is 

known as exitance (M) when considering photons that are leaving a given area or as irradiance 

(E) when they are incident upon an area. 

 

            (2.4) 

            (2.5) 

 

Figure 2.2 depicts a parallel wave train of photons leaving an area (A1) and moving towards 

another area (A2) some distance away. The radiant flux leaving area A1 is an example of 

exitance, the radiant flux incident upon A2 is an example of irradiance. 

 

 

Figure 2.2. Examples of exitance (M) and irradiance (E). The grey arrows depict the 

direction of radiant flux (i.e. photons per second). 

 

Figure 2.3 displays the case in which photons propagate from a point source and then transect 

area A1 followed by A2. The irradiance will be greater on A1 than on A2 because the photon 

trajectories are divergent.  

 

Figure 2.3. Irradiance (i.e. radiant flux per unit area) will diminish with distance from a 

point source due to divergence of photon trajectories. 



23 
 

 

The decrease in irradiance from a point source is proportional to the inverse of the squared 

distance from that source. 

   
 

  
 (2.6) 

 

A metric that is dependent on distance would be inconvenient for many applications (e.g. 

comparing field and spaceborne measurements). The concept of a solid angle is used to address 

this problem. The SI unit of a solid angle is steradians (?). 

      

 ?  
 

  
 (2.7) 

 

where A is an area on the surface of a sphere subtended by an arc, and r is the radius of the 

sphere. A solid angle is therefore dimensionless, i.e. (equation 2.7), and can encapsulate a range 

of geometries from an infinitesimally narrow beam up to a sphere (Fig. 2.4).  

 

 

Figure 2.4. Examples of solid cone geometries 

 

The radiant flux per unit steradian is called radiant intensity. 

 

          ? (2.8) 

 

Radiant intensity will not change with distance from the source (i.e. assuming that the photons 

are not absorbed, scattered or refracted by the medium through which they are propagating). This 

is because the divergence of photons matches the increase in the cross-sectional area of the solid 



24 
 

angle through which they are propagating (i.e. both increase as a function of distance squared 

from the source). 

 A steradian begins at single point in space. It is therefore necessary for the source area to 

approximate a point relative to the geometry of the solid angle through which the photons 

propagate. Essentially it requires there to be negligible difference between i) the radiant intensity 

in the hypothetical case where all photons are emitted from the centre of the source area and ii) 

radiant intensity in the actual case were photons are being emitted throughout the source area. 

This is what is meant by a point source.  

 However, although we can assume for mathematical convenience that photon trajectories 

start from the centre of the source area, the size of the source area itself is still an important 

control on the number of photons propagating into any given solid angle. If photons leave the 

surface at a uniform rate then the radiant intensity is directly proportional to the size of the source 

area (A). 

 

 
    (2.9) 

 

Radiant intensity is also dependent on the orientation in which the photons are propagating. If 

exitance from the source area is isotropic (i.e. has no directional preference) then this relationship 

is defined by Lambert's Cosine Rule (10) 

 

           (2.10) 

 

where I  is the intensity at angle   from the normal and Io is intensity at the normal. A surface that 

follows this law is known as a Lambertian surface. Radiant intensity from a Lambertian surface is 

therefore greatest at normal (i.e. perpendicular to the surface) and diminishes as   approaches 

90
o
. One way of conceptualizing why this occurs is by imagining the projection of the source area 

into the direction of the solid angle (Fig. 2.5).  

  



25 
 

 

 

Figure 2.5. The projected source area (red) will decrease in size as the orientation of the 

solid angle (blue) moves away from the normal (?). 

 

This projected source area (red line) represents the smallest area through which all photons must 

pass. Note that photons are in fact emitted from the entire source area, even though they are 

mathematically treated as propagating from a point source through a solid angle (blue cone). If 

photons are radiating equally in all directions then, as the projected area becomes smaller (i.e. as 

  increases), the number of photons entering the corresponding solid angle will also diminish. 

Radiant intensity is therefore directly proportional to the cosine of the orientation of the solid 

angle from the normal.  

 

 
       (2.11) 

 

However, the brightness of a Lambertian surface will not change with viewing angle. This is 

because radiant intensity will diminish at the same rate as the perceived size of the area. In other 

words, the surface will appear smaller as viewing angle from the normal (i.e.  ) increases, and the 

radiant intensity will also decrease as   increase, and both of these changes occur at the same rate 

(i.e. proportional to cos ). 

 Therefore, if we divide radiant intensity by Acos , we will create a measure of photon 

propagation through time and space that is not dependent on the distance, or orientation, of the 

viewer from the source nor the size of the source area, as long as the point source assumption 

remains valid. This quantity is known simply as radiance. 

 

          ?        (2.12) 

 



26 
 

The interaction between real surfaces and electromagnetic radiation is wavelength dependent. 

Modern imagers are therefore designed to be sensitive to specific parts of the spectrum. Radiance 

measured with respect to wavelength is called spectral radiance (L ). 

 

          ?           (2.13) 

 

Spectral radiance is the fundamental metric used in the field of electromagnetic remote sensing. It 

is often necessary to work back from spectral radiance measurements to calculate the amount of 

energy being emitted or reflected from a given source area. This might be the rate of radiant 

energy transfer (i.e. radiant flux [W]) or the rate of radiant energy transfer per unit area (i.e. 

exitance [W/m
2
]). The relationship between exitance (2.4) and radiance (2.13) can be expressed 

as follows: 

 

          ? (2.14) 

 

The collection of all possible photon trajectories from a flat surface will define a hemisphere 

above that surface (Fig. 2.6). The integral in (2.14) must therefore be evaluated over such a 

geometry. 

 

 

Figure 2.6. The geometry of an infinitesimal area on the surface of a hemisphere 

 



27 
 

It is possible to define a curved surface using infinitesimally small planar surfaces (i.e. in much 

the same way that infinitesimally small straight lines can be used to define a curved line). If   is 

the angle from the normal to the surface and ? is the azimuth, then ?  and ?? signify 

infinitesimally narrow components of these angles, and ?A is an infinitesimally small area (Fig. 

2.6). This area defines an infinitesimally small solid angle. The size of ?A can be calculated using 

trigonometry 

 

 ?    ?     ?? (2.15) 

 

We can therefore express solid angles in terms of actual angles, i.e. substituting (2.15) into (2.7) 

 

  ?  
         ?

  
        ? (2.16) 

 

A hemisphere can be defined in space by integrating over the azimuth (i.e. a circle, 0 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;2?) 

and the angular distance between the normal and the horizontal (i.e. 0 &amp;lt;  &amp;lt;?/2). Expressing 

exitance over these limits we have: 

 

                  

   

   

  

   

 (2.17) 

 

Which, when evaluated, gives: 

 

   ?  (2.18) 

 

Thus exitance and radiance are related by a factor of ? for Lambertian surfaces. This is an 

extremely important relationship because it becomes possible to calculate the spectral exitance of 

an isothermal surface from just one spectral radiance measurement, regardless of look angle or 

distance from source.  

 

 



28 
 

2.3. Temperature, Emissivity and Blackbodies 

 

A blackbody is a hypothetical body that absorbs all photons incident upon it and reemits them out 

again without any conversion (i.e. loss) of energy. The spectral radiant exitance from a blackbody 

is given by the Planck function. 

 

        
    

       
  
   

    
 (2.19) 

 

where T is thermodynamic temperature in Kelvin, h is Planck's constant (6.626 × 10
-34

 m
2
 kg s

-1
), 

c is the speed of light in a vacuum (2.998 × 10
8
 m s

-1
) and k is the Boltzmann constant 

(1.381 × 10
-23

 m
2
 kg s

-2
 K

-1
).  The blackbody spectral radiance from a Lambertian surface is 

therefore given by 

                 (2.20) 

 

The emission of radiance from physical materials is not perfect. This results in a deviation from 

blackbody behaviour. Spectral radiance of real physical bodies includes a spectral emissivity (? ) 

term: 

                   (2.21) 

 

The temperature of a remote surface can be determined by rearranging and substituting (2.19), 

(2.20) and (2.21) appropriately 

 

 
  

  

       
        

    
   

 
(2.22) 

 

However, given the extensive, varied and dynamic nature of the terrestrial surface, we often do 

not know spectral emissivity a priori. This results in an ill-posed problem, i.e. more unknowns 

than equations, because each spectral radiance measurement will have a corresponding unknown 

spectral emissivity term plus some unknown temperature. There has been a significant amount of 



29 
 

work towards resolving this so called temperature-emissivity separation problem for the case 

where both temperature and emissivity spectra are homogeneous at the subpixel level. A review 

of these techniques is provided by Dash et al. (2002).  

 Total radiant exitance is given by the integral of (2.19) with respect to wavelength (i.e. the 

Stefan-Boltzmann law). 

        
  (2.23) 

 

where ? is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. This shows that the radiant energy emitted by an 

isothermal blackbody surface is proportional to the 4
th

 power of temperature, and that anything 

with a temperature above absolute zero will radiate energy.  

 The wavelength at which peak radiant exitance occurs was first found by thermodynamic 

consideration of electromagnetic radiation. It can also be found by determining the maxima of 

(2.19). It is described by Wien's displacement law, 

 

          (2.24) 

 

where b is 2897.9?mK. This relationship shows that the hotter the surface the shorter the 

wavelength will be at which peak radiation occurs. It is especially useful when attempting to find 

a suitable part of the electromagnetic spectrum for a given application. For example, when 

attempting to determine the land surface temperature of ambient terrestrial environments 

(i.e. ~300K) one would expect peak radiation to occur around  9.7 ?m. Alternatively, an active 

lava surfaces at 773 K would probably display peak radiation at around 3.8 ?m. The actual peak 

will depend on the spectral emissivity of the target. 

 

2.4. Atmospheric Effects 

 

Radiation that leaves the Earth's surface must pass through the atmosphere before reaching an 

orbital sensor. Photons can be absorbed , re-emitted and scattered by gases and aerosols (i.e. the 

primary constituents of the atmosphere). This interaction is wavelength dependent. The spectral 

transmissivity (? ) of the atmosphere is given as: 

 



30 
 

    
    
  

 (2.25) 

 

where LTOA is spectral radiance leaving the top of the atmosphere and L  is spectral radiance 

leaving the Earth's surface.  

 The dominant effects on transmissivity are the concentration of H20, CO2 and aerosols in 

the atmosphere as well as the altitude of the target surface and viewing angle of the sensor (i.e. 

due to their control on the path length of photons within the atmosphere). The concentration of 

gas species and aerosols  in the atmosphere varies temporally and spatially, they must therefore 

be accounted for when attempting to determine the amount of radiance that has left the Earth's 

surface. This is typically achieved through the use of a radiance transfer code such as Moderate 

Resolution Atmospheric Transmission (MODTRAN). An example MODTRAN transmissivity 

profile from Kliuchevskoi volcano (Kamchatka) is displayed in Figure 1. 

 

 

Figure1. An example MODTRAN transmissivity profile from Kliuchevskoi volcano. The 

mid-latitude winter model was used for an at-NADIR sensor overpass. 

 

 Remote sensing applications tend to utilize spectral regions in which the atmosphere is 

highly transmissive. These so called atmospheric windows have a fundamental control on the 

practical importance, and therefore nomenclature, of different spectral regions. Studies of radiant 

energy emitted by volcanic targets are restricted to the following spectral regions: the visible and 

near infrared (VNIR; 0.4 - 1.5 ?m), the short-wave infrared (SWIR; 1.5 - 3 ?m), mid infrared 

(MIR; 3 - 5 ?m) and thermal infrared (TIR; 8 - 13?m). 



31 
 

 The spectral radiance that leaves a target surface will contain varying amounts of emitted 

and reflected components. The transmitted portion of that radiance will then reach a satellite 

detector, as will spectral radiance that is emitted and/or scatter by the atmosphere itself into the 

direction of that sensor. The spectral radiance, R , can therefore be expressed as: 

 

                             (2.26) 

 

where ?  is spectral transmissivity, ?  is spectral emissivity, L( ,T) is blackbody radiation at 

temperature T, ?  is spectral reflectance of the surface, R ,D is the downwelling atmospheric 

spectral radiance on to the surface and R ,U is the atmospheric upwelling spectral radiance. 

 

2.5. Issues with infrared monitoring of volcanoes from space 

 

In order to be able to quantify volcanic thermal activity it is first necessary to be able to detect 

thermal anomalies. This can be achieved in a number of ways, all of which are dependent on 

either the spectral, spatial or temporal characteristics of the target (e.g. Steffke &amp;amp; Harris 2011). 

The most widely adopted approach is to use spectral information. This relies on setting a 

threshold above which a single pixel radiance value, or comparative radiance value (i.e. typically 

a band ratio), is considered to be anomalous. It has the benefit of being straight-forward and 

computationally efficient but will typically struggle to detect subtle thermal anomalies whilst 

maintaining a low false alarm rate.  

 In order to be able to detect subtle thermal anomalies it is usually necessary to analyze a 

pixel in terms of its spatial and/or temporal context. Perhaps the most intuitive approach is to 

determine if an area is significantly hotter than its surrounding. This is typically how a person 

might manually search for a thermal anomaly in a qualitative sense. In order to quantify this 

spatial approach to anomaly detection it is necessary to define a background value (i.e. a 

temperature or radiance value that represents the expected response from a thermally active area 

in the hypothetical case that it is not active). A background value in a spatial context is typically 

considered to be the average value within a background area. This area might be a single pixel or 

collection of pixels. There has been little investigation into the effect that background area 

selection has on anomaly detection capabilities. For low spatial resolution data this area is often 



32 
 

considered to be very few, i.e. often just one, pixel(s) that is/are juxtaposed to the potentially 

anomalous pixel. An area this proximal to the potential heat source, however, could itself contain 

volcanically active material. Furthermore, the effect of 'thermal blurring' (i.e. predominantly due 

to the point spread function of a detector element extending beyond the nominal surface area 

represented by a pixel) will also compromise the reliability that neighbouring inactive pixels 

represent the background conditions of the active pixel. For high spatial resolution data the 

background area is often defined manually on an ad hoc basis. There is therefore no guarantee of 

the stability of a manually selected background value. Notably there are strong, non-volcanic 

temperature gradients across volcanic edifices due to i) morphological aspect with respect to the 

solar azimuth and elevation angles, ii) altitude variations and iii) heterogeneous surface 

compositions. Thus the size and location of a background area might have a strong influence on 

the resultant background value. 

 Temporal methods for anomaly detection involve comparing a fixed pixel location 

through time (e.g. Tramutoli 1998, Pergola et al. 2004). This can be used to identify whether a 

consistently cool area has become warmer, or indeed whether a consistently hot area has become 

cooler. It is somewhat more difficult to identify temporal anomalies in an area that has shown a 

high level of variability during the time period under consideration. Hybrid approaches to 

anomaly detection (e.g. Giglio et al. 2003, Koeppen et al. 2011) do show significant promise in 

being able to improve subtle detection capability whilst maintaining a low false alarm rate. 

However, all anomaly detection schemes will be effected by ephemeral obstructions between the 

line of sight of the sensor and the target area (i.e. meteorological clouds, ash plumes, gas 

emissions and aerosols) as these phenomena have wavelength dependent effects on transmissivity 

and also vary both spatial and temporally. 

 Once a strategy for thermal anomaly detection has been selected it is usually necessary to 

quantify the intensity of the corresponding thermal activity. This is best achieved using metrics 

that are physically meaningful (e.g. temperature). A major issue with calculating surface 

temperatures from volcanic targets is that they are typically thermally heterogeneous at the pixel 

scale. Thus a single temperature value will not represent the continuous temperature distribution 

of the target. A number of techniques have been developed to attempt to resolve this so called 

'thermal mixing' problem. They rely on the assumption that a subpixel temperature distribution 

can be modelled as a collection of isothermal components. 



33 
 

 

             

 

   

 (2.27) 

 

where Lpixel is the pixel radiance at a given wavelength, n is the number of isothermal subpixel 

components, and fi and Li are the size and radiance of the i
th

 component.  To solve for equation 

2.27 it is necessary to have at least as many spectral radiance measurements as there are subpixel 

thermal components. Initial attempts at subpixel thermal analysis were carried out using sensors 

that had just two pertinent spectral channels; they therefore assumed that just two thermal 

components were sufficient to reliably and accurately represent subpixel temperature 

distributions (e.g. Dozier 1981, Rothery et al. 1988, Oppenheimer 1991). As new sensors with a 

greater number of spectral channels were developed this model was extended to include three 

subpixel thermal components (e.g. Flynn et al. 1993, Oppenheimer 1993). It has since been 

shown, however, that volcanic temperature distributions cannot be reliably described using just 2 

or 3 thermal components (e.g. Oppenheimer et al. 1993a, Wright &amp;amp; Flynn 2003). More recent 

attempts, which rely on model fitting of radiance spectra, have allowed the number of subpixel 

thermal components to be found automatically during the model fitting process (e.g. Wright &amp;amp; 

Flynn 2003). Oddly they found that model solutions with just 2 or 3 thermal components 

provided good spectral fits even though this was incongruent with high spatial resolution field 

data. This raises the question of whether or not there is a better approach for resolving subpixel 

components or, indeed, whether it is at all possible. 

 Satellite sensors will inevitably exhibit a trade-off between spatial, spectral and temporal 

resolution. Volcanic activity, on the other hand, manifests itself across spatial and temporal scales 

that vary by several orders of magnitude. A single satellite sensor will therefore only be able to 

monitor a small portion of on-going volcanic activity. It is therefore necessary to use multiple 

sensors to observe the full range of eruptive products emitted by volcanoes. 

 Forecasting volcanic eruptions is one of the major goals of volcanology as a whole. It is 

not a straight-forward task because volcanoes are highly non-linear complex systems and often 

display somewhat idiosyncratic behaviour. Even so, a rising magma body will often result in 

increased thermal activity at the surface (e.g. new and/or hotter fumarolic emission, increased 

ground temperature, increased crater lake temperature, the protrusion of a lava dome, etc), all of 



34 
 

which may precede an explosive eruption and/or flow of lava. Increased fumarolic activity was 

observed before two of the most deadly eruptions in historical times, i.e. Mont Pelee, Martinique 

1902 with 29,000 fatalities; and Nevado del Ruiz, Colombia 1985 with 25,000 fatalities (Chrétien 

&amp;amp; Brousse 1989, Nakada 2000). Conversely, decreases in thermal activity have also been 

observed to precede explosive eruptions (Oppenheimer et al. 1993b). It can therefore be 

challenging to identify reliable thermal precursors. 

 

2.6. Aims of this Work 

 

The overall aim of this work is to develop and test methods for improved global monitoring of 

volcanoes from space. The specific aims, outlined below, therefore address those issues that 

currently affect infrared monitoring of volcanoes using satellite observations. 

 

i) Improve anomaly detection capability through the investigation of methodologies for selection 

of background values and spectral thresholding. 

 

ii) Explore methods for quantifying volcanic thermal anomalies whilst accounting for subpixel 

thermal mixing. The metrics used must be as intuitive as possible to ensure adoption by the 

volcano monitoring community. 

 

iii) Investigate the development of sensor synergies to increase the resolution of monitoring data 

sets.  

 

iv) Identify new thermal precursors in order to aid those responsible for forecasting future 

eruptive events

Monitoring Volcanic Thermal Anomalies from Space: Size matters

Published in the Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research, 203, 48-61, 2011. 

 

3.1. Abstract 

 

Measuring temperatures on volcanoes from space provides important constraints on the transfer 

of mass and heat to the Earth's surface. Time series of multispectral infrared images, acquired by 

the Advanced  Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) between 

2000 and 2009, were inspected to investigate fluctuations in thermal anomalies at both Mount 

Erebus (Antarctica) and Láscar volcano (Chile). Several thermal metrics were explored: i) 

maximum pixel temperatures above  background, ii) the spatial extent of low, moderate and high 

temperature anomalies, and iii) the spatial extent of short-wave infrared anomalies. The 

maximum pixel temperature metric correlated to eruptive events at Láscar volcano yet displayed 

significant scatter at Erebus. The spatial extent of both temperature and short-wave infrared 

anomalies correlates well with eruptive activity at both volcanoes. 

 Limited variation in the size of thermal anomalies was observed at Erebus throughout the 

time series due to the stability of a long-lived lava lake, with the exception of a seasonal 



36 
 

expansion in low temperature anomalies associated with localized snow-melt at the peak. This 

finding has implications for the interpretation of low temperature anomalies at other volcanoes. 

At least two different types of precursory signals are identified at Láscar: i) a gradual increase 

and ii) a dip, in the size and intensity of thermal anomalies. These thermal precursors appear to be 

associated with different eruptive styles. The former precedes a relatively shallow, short lived 

eruption; the later a prolonged eruptive period. Such thermal precursors could therefore help to 

constrain not only the timing but also the style and duration of an imminent eruptive episode. 

 

3.2. Introduction 

 

Volcanoes are hazardous, non-linear systems and so require regular monitoring if timely forecasts 

of eruptive behaviour are to be given and if we are to improve our understanding of dynamic 

volcanic processes. Ideally volcanologists would have access to information from all of the 

world's subaerial volcanoes. This way a greater understanding of fundamental volcanic processes 

can contribute to the expert knowledge required to deal with specific volcanoes that may be 

endangering communities or property. Orbital remote sensing provides the necessary perspective 

to fulfil such an ideal and is often the only source of information available for many remote 

volcanoes.  

 The approach adopted in this study is to measure the temperature of active volcanoes 

from space using multispectral thermal infrared (TIR) images taken by the Advanced Spaceborne 

Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), currently the only multispectral TIR 

sensor in orbit with moderate (&lt;100 m) spatial resolution imagery that is available to the civilian 

community. Previous authors have utilized the combined spatial and spectral resolution of this 

sensor to describe volcanic activity. Special consideration has been given to the reliability of 

terrestrial surface temperature estimates at these wavelengths (i.e. 8.125–11.65 ?m). The metrics 

used to quantify such observations have included the maximum pixel temperature (Ramsey and 

Dehn, 2004; Vaughan and Hook, 2006; Carter et al. 2008), the average crater temperature 

(Vaughan and Hook, 2006) and the maximum pixel temperature above background (Ramsey and 

Dehn, 2004; Pieri and Abrams, 2005; Vaughan et al. 2008; Carter et al. 2008). Although these 

thermal parameters were all shown to correlate with volcanic activity, they do not measure the 

actual size of the anomaly (Carter et al. 2008). This study aims toward developing methods for 



37 
 

measuring both the size and intensity of volcanic thermal anomalies. We further support the 

investigation of TIR-based thermal anomalies by comparison to ASTER's short-wave infrared 

(SWIR) bands. 

 In order to explore an existing TIR-based parameter we first analyze temporal fluctuations 

in maximum pixel temperature above background. This parameter was selected because it is the 

most widely adopted in the previous literature, accounts for non-volcanic seasonal variations in 

temperature and has been shown to correlate particularly well with eruptive behaviour. We then 

describe the change in the size and intensity of thermal anomalies (both TIR- and SWIR based) 

through time at Mt. Erebus (Antarctica) and Láscar (Chile). These targets exhibit markedly 

different styles of volcanism and are situated thousands of kilometres apart from each other, thus 

providing a contrast in eruptive styles as well as demonstrating one of the advantages of the 

global perspective available from space. 

 

3.3. Study areas 

 

3.3.1. Erebus volcano 

 

Erebus volcano (77°32?S, 167°10?E, 3794m) is an alkaline intraplate stratovolcano situated on 

Ross Island, Antarctica (Fig. 3.1) (Kyle et al. 1992; Oppenheimer et al. 2011). It contains one of 

the few permanent, terrestrial lava lakes. The bulk composition of its phonolitic lava appears to 

have remained unchanged over the last ~36 ka (Harpel et al. 2004; Esser et al. 2004; Kelly et al. 

2008). The lake is thought to be sustained by magma convection via a conduit leading to a 

reservoir at depth. The first historical sighting of the volcano was reported in 1841 (Ross, 1847), 

with a lava lake having been observed in the active crater since modern observations began in 

1972 (Giggenbach et al. 1973). 

 The permanent lake (referred to in the recent literature as Ray's lake) is sometimes 

accompanied by an ephemeral lake (at Werner's fumarole). Construction of the volcano began 

around 1.3 million years ago and is associated with crustal thinning and a possible mantle plume. 

The arid, polar climate in which the volcano is situated suppresses cloud cover and, coupled with 

the volcano's constant activity, makes Mount Erebus an excellent target for developing space-



38 
 

based thermal monitoring techniques of active volcanoes (e.g. Harris et al. 1999; Davies et al. 

2008; Wright and Pilger, 2008; Vaughan et al. 2010)

3.3.2. Láscar volcano 

 

Láscar (23°22?S, 67°44?W, 5592 m) is a young (&amp;lt;50 ka old; Matthews et al. 1997) compound 

stratocone situated in the Chilean Altiplano to the East of the Salar de Atacama (Fig. 3.2). It is 

built from porphyritic andesites and dacites (Matthews et al. 1994). Historical activity is recorded 

back to 1848 (Venzke et al., 2002 -). The high and arid environment is associated with limited 

cloud, vegetation, snow and ice cover, thus making Láscar a very suitable terrain for geological 

remote sensing (de Silva and Francis, 1991). These environmental factors, coupled with Láscar's 

persistent degassing and frequent small-to-moderate explosive eruptions, have favoured 

numerous remote sensing studies of Láscar volcano over the past quarter century (e.g. Francis 

and Rothery, 1987; Oppenheimer et al. 1993b; Wooster, 2001; Pavez et al. 2006).

3.4. ASTER and data processing 

 

The ASTER sensor, launched onboard the Terra satellite, has been acquiring multispectral 

images of the Earth's surface for just over a decade. The imaging wavebands of this sensor fall 

into three spectral regions: i) the visible and near-infrared (VNIR), with four channels from 0.52 

to 0.86 ?m, 15 m spatial resolution and stereoscopic viewing capability, ii) the short-wave 

infrared (SWIR), which has six channels from 1.6 to 2.43 ?m and 30 m spatial resolution, and iii) 

five channels in the thermal infrared with 90 m spatial resolution (Yamaguchi et al. 1998). 

Acquisition of SWIR data ended in early 2008 due to degradation of the detector cooler system. 

ASTER scenes are available at various processing levels, including raw at-sensor radiance values 

(L1A) as well as geometrically and radiometrically corrected sensor radiance values (L1B), 

which can be used to derive level 2 data products, such as atmospherically corrected surface 

radiance or surface temperature and emissivity.  

 This study uses the TIR at-surface radiance data product (AST_09T). These scenes were 

visually scrutinized for the presence of clouds and discarded if cloud formations were situated 



40 
 

over the volcano. The images were then converted into land surface temperatures using the 

Normalized Emissivity Method (NEM) (Realmuto, 1990) using a maximum emissivity value of 

0.97. The resulting surface temperature estimates are dependent, among other factors, on seasonal 

and diurnal cycles as well as potential volcanic activity. To suppress non-volcanic variations 

through time we first calculate the background temperature, BTk, as follows: 

 

       (3.1) 

  

where Ti, k is a pixel temperature and n is the number of pixels in the background area ?k for the 

i
th

 pixel in the k
th

 scene. The background temperature is therefore the average temperature of 

pixels within the background area. A temperature above background, ?T, is found by subtracting 

the background temperature from a given pixel: 

 

         (3.2)  

 

Pixels close to background temperature will have low ?T values while volcanically heated pixels 

will be represented by positive ?T anomalies. 

 

3.4.1. Background areas 

 

As stipulated in Eq.(3.1) a background area is required to calculate a background temperature. 

Land surface temperatures are not homogenous. Therefore the size, shape and location of the 

background area will affect the background temperature. In previous studies these areas have 

ranged in size and location from a  few pixels that are juxtaposed to anomalous regions, to 50×50 

pixel arrays situated on neighbouring topographic peaks (e.g. Ramsey and Dehn, 2004; Pieri and 

Abrams, 2005; Carter et al. 2008; Vaughan et al. 2010). To demonstrate the potential sensitivity 

of background temperatures to the location of the background area we defined a square-shaped 

sample area (10 × 10 pixels) and moved it through 16 different, non-overlapping locations around 

the centre of volcanic activity (Fig. 3.3). A background temperature was calculated for 16 such 

footprints for each scene. We then repeated this procedure for all scenes in the data set. 



41 
 

 With the exception of gas/aerosol plumes, reported volcanic activity is constrained within 

the active crater at both volcanoes. The sample areas are always situated at least 15 pixels (i.e. 

1.35 km) beyond the crater centre. Inspection of temperature images reveals that the plumes have 

negligible thermal influence at such distances. In the presence of significant SO2 in the plume the 

NEM algorithm is still capable of producing reliable temperature retrievals due to automatic 

selection of the most appropriate band (e.g. in this case either ASTER band 13 or 14, both of 

which avoid SO2 absorption features). The background temperatures recorded by each of the 

footprints can therefore be considered as non-volcanic. 

 

 

Figure 3.3. The box-shaped areas used to sample background temperatures at both a) 

Erebus and b) Láscar. The boxes are 10 pixels (i.e. 900 m) in length. North is up in both 

images. 

 

 The range (i.e. absolute difference between minimum and maximum) of background 

temperatures for the 16 grids was calculated on a scene by scene basis and plotted for a) Erebus 

and b) Láscar throughout the 2000–2009 time series (Fig. 3.4).  

 



42 
 

 

Figure 3.4. The range in box sample temperatures at a) Erebus and b) Láscar. Red squares 

and black crosses symbolize daytime and nighttime scenes, respectively. 

 

This provides an indication of the sensitivity of a background temperature to the location of the 

background area. Nighttime scenes (black crosses - Fig. 3.4) tend to display a limited range in 

sample temperatures (i.e. means of 6.7 °C at Erebus and 4.7 °C at Láscar). This indicates that 

they are less sensitive to the location of the background area than the daytime scenes (red squares 

- Fig. 3.4) which have mean ranges of 12.2 °C at Erebus and 26.3 °C at Láscar. The maximum 

range in background temperatures is 18.9 °C at Erebus and 34.0 °C at Láscar. Hence there is a 

significant dependence of the background temperature on the location of the background area at 

both volcanoes, especially during the daytime. We interpreted this dependence as being 

predominantly due to preferential solar heating arising from variations in slope, aspect and solar 

azimuth at the time of image acquisition.  

 The sensitivity to diurnal effects as a result of slope aspect can be mitigated by defining 

the background area as an annulus around the active crater (as opposed to the square regions 

displayed in Fig. 3.3). Such a background will act to balance out topographically driven thermal 

heterogeneities and therefore stabilize background temperature estimates, even during the day. To 

define a ring-shaped area it is necessary to assign appropriate values for the inner and outer 

radius. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



43 
 

3.4.2. Radius pairs 

 

To determine which inner and outer radius pair is most appropriate, sample temperatures were 

calculated for the area defined by all possible combinations of radius pairs that obey the 

following two criteria i) the inner radius may vary between 0 and 39 pixels, and ii) the outer 

radius may vary between 1 and 40 pixels but must be larger than the inner radius. This produces a 

total of 820 separate ring sample temperatures for each scene  

 To select the optimum radius pairs we impose two constraints. The first is based on the 

assumption that a radial profile of temperatures will tend to decrease monotonically toward the 

active crater due to topographic effects up until the point at which that profile passes through a 

volcanically heated area. The coldest ring temperature will therefore provide the best estimate of 

the non-volcanic (i.e. background) temperature in the active crater. The second constraint is that 

the total area of the background ring should be sufficiently large to smooth out unrepresentative 

pixel temperatures (e.g. due to the  presence of undetected clouds and/or volcanic products, etc.). 

We define ‘sufficiently large’ as an area of  at least 400 pixels based on the suggested size of a 

standardized array given by Vaughan et al. (2010). The  background temperatures are not 

sensitive to this minimum size constraint, as shown below.  

 To validate the first constraint we calculated ring sample background temperatures for 

neighbouring, inactive volcanic peaks (i.e. Aguas Calientes for Láscar and Mount Bird for 

Erebus). The deviation of each ring sample from the minimum ring sample was then calculated 

on a scene by scene basis to locate the coldest annular regions and to facilitate comparisons 

through time. The average deviation of ring samples from minimum was then calculated for all 

scenes in order to provide a metric that indicates by how much a given radius pair will tend to 

deviate from the coldest sample temperature (Fig. 3.5). 

 As expected, ring temperatures tend to be coldest at the top of these peaks (i.e. low radii 

values) and to warm up progressively down slope (i.e. warmer temperatures correspond to higher 

radii values). Aguas Calientes displays greater thermal contrast on average between minimum 

and maximum ring temperatures at this scale (i.e. average range of ~9 °C at Aguas Calientes and 

~6 °C at Mount Bird). This is presumably due to the more pronounced relief at Aguas Calientes 

as well as the stronger thermal heterogeneity in daytime land surface temperatures on the 

Altiplano in comparison to Ross Island. 

 



44 
 

 

Figure 3.5. Average deviation of ring sample temperatures from the minimum ring sample 

temperature for neighbouring, non-active topographic peaks at a) Mt. Bird (Antarctica) 

and b) Aguas Calientes (Chile). 

 

 Volcanic heating can clearly perturb a temperature gradient, with the active region 

becoming significantly warmer than the surrounding area. The average deviation of ring sample 

temperatures from minimum is calculated for a) Erebus and b) Láscar (Fig. 3.6.).  

 

 

Figure 3.6. Average deviation of ring sample temperatures from the minimum for a) 

Erebus and b) Láscar volcano. Optimum radius pairs are highlighted with a white square 

outline. 

 



45 
 

Areas close to the active crater (i.e. low radii values) tend to be relatively hot. The coolest regions 

are situated fairly close to the active peak (i.e. the blue-black arc shaped region). Regions that are 

further out still (i.e. high radii values) tend to be relatively warm as they are situated at lower 

altitude. The optimum radius pairs (i.e. coldest average ring which is at least 400 pixels in size) 

have inner and outer radii of i) 10 and 15 pixels at Erebus, and ii) 8 and 14 pixels at Láscar. They 

are highlighted using a white square outline in Fig. 3.6. These optimum background areas are 

displayed for both a) Erebus and b) Láscar in Fig. 3.7. 

 

 

Figure 3.7. The size and location of optimum ring-shaped background areas at both a) 

Erebus and b) Láscar. North is up in both images. 

 

 Comparison between the optimum ring temperatures and the minimum ring temperatures 

on a scene by scene basis reveals that their average difference is 0.29±0.25 °C at Erebus and 

0.68±1.0 °C at Láscar. The optimum background temperatures are therefore generally insensitive 

to the minimum size constraint. Even so the implementation of this constraint will yield a more 

reliable background temperature estimate. Furthermore, the fact that background areas are 

allowed to adapt to each volcano represents a crucial step toward facilitating the use of this 

technique on a global basis. 

 



46 
 

3.4.3. Background temperatures 

 

Having defined the optimum size, shape and location of a background area it is possible to 

calculate the background temperature for a given scene (i.e. Eq.(1)). The background temperature 

is calculated for all scenes at both a) Erebus and b) Láscar (Fig. 3.8).  

 Comparison of background temperatures highlights climatic differences at both 

volcanoes. The background temperatures tend to be significantly colder at Erebus (Fig. 3.8a) then 

at Láscar (Fig. 3.8b), ranging from approximately ?50 to ?20 °C at the former and ?15 to 35 °C 

at the latter. However, the disparity between daytime and nighttime temperatures is more 

pronounced at Láscar. This is due to the fact that the volcano is situated at subtropical latitudes 

on a desert Altiplano, while Erebus is situated at polar latitudes and spends the majority of the 

year in either continuous darkness or continuous light, with a 24 hour diurnal cycle only 

occurring during the Austral spring and autumn. A recent independent field measure taken from 

within the active crater on the 13th December 2005 (Vaughan et al. 2010) found a background 

temperature value (i.e. -15.8 °C) that is comparable to our concurrent value of ?19.0 °C measured 

from space.  

 The ASTER sensor is in a sun-synchronous orbit therefore images of a given point on the 

Earth's surface are acquired within a fixed time window for ascending and descending orbits. 

Image acquisitions of Erebus occur at either 14:05 +/-30 or 20:32 +/-20 UTC, while images of 

Láscar are acquired at either 14:51 +/-10 or 03:20 +/-10 UTC. The benefit of taking images at the 

same time of day or night is that diurnal variations in temperature are suppressed. Meteorological 

effects have also been minimized by screening out cloudy scenes. Seasonal effects are therefore 

the major influence on background temperatures in these time series. A reasonable model of this 

effect can be achieved through the use of a sinusoidal function (Eq. 3.3). 

 

        (3.3) 

 

where BT* is the modelled background temperature, a, is the amplitude of seasonal temperature 

fluctuations, ? is angular frequency (i.e. 2? per year), t is time, ? is the phase (i.e. onset of the 

seasons) and c is the point about which the function oscillates (i.e. approximately the average 

temperature of the time series). The model is justifiable because seasonal effects are 



47 
 

predominantly controlled by a stable cyclic motion (i.e. the Earth revolving around the sun), that 

does not show significant perturbation over this timeframe.  

 

 

Figure 3.8. The background temperatures of a) Erebus and b) Láscar volcanoes from 2000 

to 2009. Red squares and black crosses denote daytime and nighttime images, respectively. 

Error bars are one standard deviation. 

 

 Daytime and nighttime temperatures are modelled separately for Láscar although such a 

distinction is not made at Erebus as polar diurnal and seasonal cycles are somewhat 

synchronized. Models are fit using least-squares regression. The mean absolute error from the 

model is less than 4.5 °C for all data sets (Table 3.1). Láscar daytime scenes display the largest 

BT* amplitude, indicating that they are the most susceptible to seasonal variations. The best fit is 



48 
 

provided by Láscar night-time series. However, we observe that while Láscar day and night 

scenes should be in phase they are ~100 days apart. We attribute this discrepancy to the limited 

number of daytime scenes in this data set and correspondingly poorer constraint of the daytime 

model.

temperatures. Mean and maximum absolute errors are also provided. 

 

 

 

3.5. Anomalous volcanic temperatures 

 

Although the ASTER sensor is particularly well suited to calculating terrestrial temperatures, 

existing metrics that describe volcanic temperatures estimates from space are limited in the sense 

that they do not identify all anomalous pixels. Instead they measure either the single hottest pixel 

temperature (e.g. Ramsey and Dehn, 2004; Pieri and Abrams, 2005; Vaughan and Hook, 2006; 

Carter et al. 2008; Vaughan et al. 2008), which may undergo a sub-pixel component analysis (e.g. 

Pieri and Abrams, 2005 and Hirn et al. 2008), or they measure a crater-averaged temperature 

(Vaughan and Hook, 2006). The maximum temperature above background has arguably proved 

the most insightful metric so far. It has been used to detect new high temperature features, such as 

fumaroles and lava domes (e.g. Ramsey and Dehn, 2004; Vaughan et al. 2008) as well as to 

describe cooler materials such as pyroclastic flow deposits and lahar deposits (e.g. Ramsey and 

Dehn, 2004; Carter et al. 2008). As mentioned previously, however, a significant drawback of 

measuring just the maximum pixel temperature is that it does not provide any spatial information 

regarding anomalies (Carter et al. 2008). For example, the same maximum temperature value 

could correspond to a small isolated anomaly on one date and a larger widespread anomaly on 



49 
 

another. We propose that an improved measure of volcanic activity would account for all 

anomalous pixels. To create such a metric it is necessary first to define an appropriate threshold 

for thermally anomalous pixels. 

 

3.5.1. Anomalously hot pixels 

 

For a pixel to be considered anomalously hot it must exceed the background temperature by a 

significant amount. Such a threshold can be determined by calculating the natural variability of 

?Ts within a dataset and then defining a statistical limit above which background ?Ts are not 

expected to exceed. To achieve such a goal it is necessary to convert individual ?Ts into a 

measure of variability. We use z-scores, zi, k, for this purpose, given by: 

 

         (3.4) 

 

where ?Ti, k is a pixel temperature above background and ?k the standard deviation of the 

background temperature, and subscripts denote i
th

 pixels in k
th

 scenes. A z-score is therefore a 

normalized measure of deviation from the background temperature. The background (i.e. mean) 

temperature is represented by a z-score of zero. A pixel temperature that is one standard deviation 

above or below this mean will have a z-score of 1 or ?1, respectively.  

 A frequency distribution (i.e. histogram) of z-scores can be converted into a probability 

density function (PDF) by normalizing appropriately. We determine a PDF of z-scores for all 

scenes at A) Erebus and B) Láscar that were acquired by i) day and ii) night (Fig. 3.9). These 

PDFs represent the expected deviation of background pixels from the background temperature in 

units of standard deviations.  

 Daytime distributions are somewhat bimodal, this is presumably due to the amalgamation 

of two principal temperature distributions which correspond to i) surfaces on the volcanic edifice 

that are more exposed to solar radiation and ii) surfaces that are in shadow. Nighttime 

distributions are unimodal at both volcanoes and quite strongly asymmetric at Láscar, with the 

mode (i.e. peak probability) occurring distinctly above the mean. This may be due to more 

efficient heat loss from relatively warm areas, which consequently bunches together pixel 

temperatures that are above the mean.  



50 
 

 

Figure 3.9. Probability density functions of background z-scores at a) Erebus, v) Láscar 

during i) the day and ii) the night, calculated using all scenes in each dataset. 

 

 We can see from these PDFs that the vast majority of pixel temperatures will not exceed 

the background temperature by more than two standard deviations. In particular, 99% of z-scores 

are below two at Láscar (during the day or night) as well as for the Erebus night time series, 

while 98% of scenes have z-scores below two for the Erebus daytime series. 

 An anomaly could be defined on a scene by scene basis by using a given z-score 

threshold. However, as variations in background temperatures are seasonally dependent, it 

follows that such a measure of anomaly would also be seasonally dependent. To introduce a more 

consistent measure of thermal anomaly through time we select the maximum standard deviation 

of background temperatures within a time series, ?max, and use twice its value as a threshold. A 

pixel is therefore considered to be anomalous if it satisfies the condition outlined in equation 3.5. 

 

         (3.5) 



51 
 

This provides a fixed criterion for detecting anomalies in a given time series and a very low false 

alarm rate. The maximum standard deviation of background temperatures at Erebus and Láscar 

are 4.9 and 11.7 °C during the day and 2.4 and 3.6 °C during the night, respectively. 

Temperatures above background would therefore be considered as anomalously hot if they 

exceeded 9.8 °C or 23.4 °C for daytime series, and 4.8 °C or 7.2 °C for nighttime series at Erebus 

and Láscar, respectively. We note that variability in daytime temperatures hinders subtle thermal 

anomaly detection. Nonetheless, the metric proposed here accounts for the natural fluctuation 

within a dataset and describes a statistical limit beyond which we identify volcanogenic heating. 

 

3.5.2. The spatial extent of thermal anomalies 

 

Given this quantification of ‘anomalously hot’ pixels it is possible to determine the overall size of 

anomalous areas by simply counting the relevant pixels. In order to focus on local volcanic 

effects the target area for such an anomaly search was defined as the circular region within the 

background area. The frequency distributions of anomalous temperatures can also be obtained by 

binning pixels into given temperature ranges. This discriminates, for example, large cool areas 

from small hot areas, thus facilitating the interpretation of thermal anomalies. Here, we classify 

three anomaly classes as follows: i) cool (?T &amp;lt;30 °C), ii) moderate (30 &amp;lt;?T &amp;lt;60 °C) and iii) 

hot (?T &gt; 60 °C). We avoid defining a larger number of narrower thermal regions at present 

given that it may not be appropriate at this spatial resolution. 

 

3.5.3. SWIR anomalies 

 

Nighttime short-wave infrared anomalies are also calculated using an analogous background 

value and standard deviation threshold, although in this case to differentiate from sensor noise as 

opposed to seasonal or diurnal affects. We did not analyze daytime SWIR images as solar 

irradiation tends to significantly hinder anomaly detection at these wavelengths. It is important to 

note that saturation occurs frequently in the SWIR wavebands over these targets (i.e. in 84% of 

Erebus scenes and 48% of Láscar scenes). This arises because the upwelling radiation reaching 

the satellite sensors often exceeds the dynamic ranges of the various ASTER SWIR detectors and 

therefore limits the extent to which the SWIR channels can be used for quantitative 



52 
 

measurements. As such we limit classification of pixels within SWIR scenes to the binary case of 

being either anomalous or not anomalous. 

 

3.6. Results 

 

3.6.1. Maximum temperatures above background 

  

A series of maximum pixel temperatures above background are given for a) Erebus and b) Láscar 

(Fig. 3.10). The Erebus time series (Fig. 3.10a) reveals considerable scatter in both daytime and 

nighttime scenes and no clear secular trends. On the other hand, Láscar displays a more coherent 

temporal pattern (Fig. 3.10b) which appears to show pronounced changes in intensity with 

respect to most of the reported erupted episodes at Láscar (Bulletin of the Global Volcanism 

Network. Láscar. 2000, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007). The reported mid-points of these 

episodes are highlighted as triangles in Fig. 3.10b.  

The scatter at Erebus appears to be incongruent with the limited variation in thermal 

output from the lava lake that has been observed using both long term orbital data (Wright and 

Pilger, 2008) and field thermography (Calkins et al. 2008; Oppenheimer et al. 2009). There are 

several potential contributing factors to this scatter. One such influence is the dependence of pixel 

temperatures on the fractional area of the lake within a given pixel. The size of the lake during 

this time period varied between ~700 and 1400 m
2
 (Csatho et al. 2008; Calkins et al. 2008) while 

each ASTER TIR pixels corresponds to an area of ~8100 m
2
. The lake may therefore ‘fit’ 

completely within a single pixel or be divided between up to four pixels. The number of pixels 

within which the lava lake is imaged will influence the maximum temperature of a given scene. 

This dependency is modelled below (see Discussion) using a 3-component model of the lava lake 

system, with hot cracks, crust and non-volcanic background, to demonstrate that maximum pixel 

temperatures vary significantly as a function of the maximum proportion of the lava lake within a 

given pixel.  

 Other factors that may also create scatter in maximum pixel temperatures at Erebus 

include i) the concentration, composition and location of aerosols and gas plumes, ii) short time 

scale variations in radiative output from the lake due to pulsatory magma supply and gas 

emission, iii) the amount and temperature of spatter around the lake, iv) the disposition of other 



53 
 

thermal anomalies within the Erebus crater (e.g. the ephemeral ‘Werner’ lava lake), v) the 

background temperature itself in the case that pixel saturation occurs, vi) meteorological effects; 

of which air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed might have an important control on 

the development of fumes, and vii) the viewing geometry; which is dependent on the nadir angle 

of the sensor at the time of acquisition (i.e. nadir varies between +/?8.6 in both data sets), the 

position of the anomaly within the swath and the topography of the target area.

squares and black crosses denote daytime and nighttime images, respectively. The midpoint

54 
 

 The maximum temperature series at Láscar displays a significant contrast in style. 

Temporal trends are discernible and appear associated with eruptive events. These trends include 

a) two eruptive precursors, namely i) a gradual increase before the 2002 eruption and ii) a gradual 

decrease followed by an increase before the 2006 eruption, b) syn-eruptive increases during the 

2000 and 2006 eruptions as well as c) post-eruptive changes, with a brief increase after the 2003 

eruption and sustained decrease after the 2006 eruption.  

 The onset of the first eruption in the Láscar time series occurs within 7 months of the 

launch of the ASTER sensor. Trends preceding this eruption are therefore unclear. However 

maximum temperatures  are higher during the eruptive episode relative to pre-eruptive values. 

Few data were available for 2001, with only one suitable cloud-free scene available for that year. 

We thus have no data bearing on the eruptive episode reported to have occurred between 4
th

 May 

and 6
th

 July 2001 (Venzke et al. 2002 -).  

 The October 2002 eruptive episode consisted of several small explosions that produced 

ash plumes ranging in height from 300 to1500 m above the crater rim (Bulletin of the Global 

Volcanism Network. Láscar. 2003). This episode was preceded by a progressive increase in 

maximum pixel temperatures above background (Fig. 3.10b). Lava dome growth and destruction 

have been associated with a number of Láscar's past eruptions but no dome was observed in the 

active crater throughout 2000 - 2002 (Bulletin of the Global Volcanism Network. Láscar. 2003). 

The increase in thermal output apparent from the ASTER time series is therefore likely to 

represent an increase in the temperature and/or flux of  gas emission. Increases in fumarolic 

activity have also been observed before explosive eruptions at other stratovolcanoes (e.g. July 

1985 at Nevado del Ruiz, Colombia [Scientific Event Alert Network. Nevado del Ruiz. 1985], 

July 1995 at Soufrière Hills, Montserrat [Bulletin of the Global Volcanism Network. Soufrière 

Hills. 1995], and May 2010 at Bezymianny, Kamchatka [Smithsonian Institute. Bezymianny 

Weekly Reports. May, 2010]).  

 Following the October 2002 eruption the active crater collapsed by several tens of meters, 

producing a deep, steep depression roughly 200 m in diameter and 200 m deep (Bulletin of  the 

Global Volcanism Network. Láscar. 2003). Fumarolic activity continued after this time and was  

punctuated by the occurrence of a 400 m high, grey coloured plume in December 2003 (Bulletin 

of the Global Volcanism Network. Láscar. 2004). No thermal precursors are apparent before this 

eruption. The brief peak in maximum temperatures after the event perhaps indicates that a 



55 
 

temporary, post-eruptive increase in fumarolic activity occurred. Such an increase could be the 

result of decompression of magma remaining in the upper conduit following the expulsion of 

magma during the eruption, facilitating both the exsolution and transport of volatiles to the 

surface. Alternatively it may indicate that an active lava dome  was exposed at the surface at that 

time.  

 Local residents (15–60 km from the volcano) did not report any earthquakes or explosions 

in relation to a Vulcanian eruption of May 2005. Nor do we observe any significant changes in 

maximum temperatures above background before, during or after this event. Nevertheless, an ash 

cloud was observed in AVHRR imagery and very fine ash fall was also reported in Salta 

(Argentina) ~285 km SSE (Bulletin of the Global Volcanism Network. Láscar. 2005).  

 Field observations of the active crater in December 2005 (i.e. after the May 2005 

eruption) revealed that the crater floor was no longer visible from the accessible (i.e. Southern) 

side of the crater rim, indicating that further subsidence had occurred (Bulletin of the Global 

Volcanism Network. Láscar. 2006). Maximum temperatures show a gradual decrease throughout 

this time (i.e. from May to December 2005) and may be related to crater collapse and an overall 

reduction in permeability in the upper conduit. Mechanisms for such permeability reduction 

include: i) bubble collapse of a foamy lava, ii) precipitation of hydrothermal minerals, iii) 

welding and fusion of the conduit walls, and iv) increases in the dynamic viscosity and strength 

of magma by cooling, degassing and crystallization (Matthews et al. 1997). This trend is 

analogous to the behaviour described for the 1993 eruptive style (Oppenheimer et al. 1993b), at 

which time decreases in conduit permeability and therefore fumarolic activity (as inferred from 

decreases in radiant flux measured by Landsat infrared bands) were shown to precede eruptive 

events. We note that it is possible that the collapse of the crater may also act to obscure some of 

the radiance emitted by the volcano from reaching the sensor in off-nadir scenes.  

 Here we also observe, for the first time, an increase in maximum temperatures (i.e. 

~January to April 2006) following a gradual decrease as described above. It is not clear whether 

this represents a sudden increase in permeability, the emplacement of a lava dome or perhaps 

even an unreported eruption.  Maximum temperatures above background remain elevated 

throughout the April 2006 - July 2007 eruptive period. This could reflect a period of elevated 

strong fumarolic activity or possibly effusion of a lava dome. No lava dome was observed during 

fieldwork at the active crater carried out by one of us (S. Murphy) on 10 December 2009 



56 
 

(Fig. 3.11), though the crater floor was still not visible from the Southern rim of the volcano at 

that time.

the 10
th

 December 2009. A lava dome is not visible, however, neither is the crater floor due 

to local topographic relief. 

 

 After this final eruptive period (i.e. July 2007 onwards) maximum temperatures above 

background remained consistently low, with anomalies only being detected at night. A small 

increase in these maximum temperatures can be seen throughout the remainder of 2007. 

Following this a gradual decrease in maximum temperatures is observed until the end of the time 

series (i.e. 18
th

 April 2009). We infer that fumarolic intensity was relatively low at this time, 

perhaps reflecting waning degassing of residual magma in the conduit.

The spatial extents of thermally anomalous regions for both a) Erebus and b) Láscar are displayed

high temperature anomalies, as well as iv) SWIR anomalies. Note the distinction between 

daytime and nighttime scenes.

that temperature and  SWIR pixel sizes are not the same (i.e. 90 and 30 m, respectively). 

Red squares and black crosses denote daytime and nighttime images, respectively. 

 

 

 



58 
 

3.6.2.1. Erebus 

 

Low temperature anomalies at Erebus (Fig. 3.12a i) display a strong dependence on solar 

irradiation with peaks occurring during daylight hours. Comparison with VNIR scenes indicates 

that these low temperature anomalies often coincide with bare rock around the Erebus crater and 

to Sun facing rocks beyond the caldera edge. Ideally the background area would represent all the 

inactive surfaces in the target area (i.e. both snow and rock in this case). However, simply 

incorporating the exposed rocks around the crater rim into the background area is likely to 

produce unreliable background temperatures given that fumarolic activity up the inner crater 

walls and/or the presence of plumes can thermally contaminate such proximal regions. We do not 

attempt to fine tune the background selection methodology here but rather emphasize the caution 

required in interpretation of thermal anomalies and the value of comparing the anomaly maps 

with the original reflectance datasets.  

 While the low temperature anomaly class is stable at night, the size of moderate and high 

temperature anomalies (Fig. 3.12a ii and iii) is stable regardless of the solar elevation angle. A 

notably large moderate temperature anomaly occurs on 27
th

 January 2001. The image acquired at 

this time includes the full suite of ASTER sensor bands (Fig. 3.13) in which a) a thick plume, 

~500m in diameter, is visible in the VNIR, b) a second thermal feature, probably Werner's 

fumarole, is discernible in the SWIR bands, and c) a fairly large (i.e. 16 pixel) moderate 

temperature anomaly and a wide-spread, low temperature anomaly are present; the former 

appears to be associated with the plume and the later to exposed rock surfaces.  

 The SWIR anomalies, as a whole, support evidence for a consistent high temperature 

source. The size of these anomalies typically vary around 10 - 20 SWIR pixels, i.e. 9000 - 18,000 

m
2
 (Fig. 3.12a iv). This is larger than the known area of the lava lake by a factor of ~10 and 

likely results from the disparity between the lava lake signal and the immediate crater 

surroundings. To illustrate this point, imagine an isothermal lava crust at 500 °C and a 

surrounding area at 0 °C. If both radiate as blackbodies then the crust will emit 3.4×10

 at 

this wavelength, i.e. a difference of seven orders of magnitude. Scattering (enhanced by the gas 

and aerosol plume) of just a small fraction (e.g. 1%) of the lava lake radiation into the 

instantaneous field of view (IFOV) of adjacent detector elements would increase the size of the 



59 
 

anomaly such that it does not accurately map to the feature's true dimensions. Another factor that 

blurs SWIR anomalies is the relationship between the IFOV and detector resampling frequency. 

Pixels do not map perfectly to areas on the ground from which the radiation was sensed but rather 

correspond to upwelling radiation received from a wider solid angle defined by the detector's 

point spread function. Furthermore it is also possible that some hysteresis effects occur as the 

sensor scans over very hot targets. These factors combine to significantly smear out of the signal 

of high temperature features such as lava lakes. They may also contribute to increasing the 

variability in the size of SWIR anomalies through time. Other factors that may increase this 

variability include those mentioned previously as influences on maximum pixel temperatures 

(Section 5.1) as well as intermittent activity at Werner's fumarole (which is occasionally 

incandescent and which was also the site of an ephemeral lava lake in December 2004).

images are to the same scale and North is up.

3.6.2.2. Láscar 

 

There is an increase in the size of low, moderate and high temperature anomalies during the first 

eruptive episode of the Láscar time series (i.e. 20
th

 June 2000 to 18
th

 January 2001), as was also 

observed in the intensity of the maximum temperature series. A SWIR anomaly is only detected 

toward the end of this period and at 35 pixels in size, it is one of the largest in this data set. As 

mentioned previously no dome was observed in the active crater at this time (Bulletin of the 

Global Volcanism Network. Láscar. 2003), which may indicate that this large SWIR anomaly is 

due to high temperature fumaroles. There may be a suggestion of a precursory increase in low 

and moderate temperature anomalies before this eruptive period. Again it is difficult to confirm 

such a hypothesis given the limited time span between the start of ASTERs operational life and 

the onset of this eruption.  

 Low, high and, to a lesser extent, moderate anomalies show a progressive increase before 

the third eruptive period (9
th

 October 2002). This is analogous to the behaviour of maximum 

pixel temperatures and indicates that the size and maximum temperature of thermal anomalies 

were correlated at this time. The thermal distribution of anomalies suggests that fumarolic 

intensity was increasing over this time period, i.e. extensive, low temperature anomaly with an 

irregular, dynamic shape and a central warmer region that increases in both size and intensity 

(Fig. 3.14). SWIR anomalies were relatively extensive and stable in size (Fig. 3.12b iv) which is 

consistent with an increase in the flux and/or temperature of emissions from existing fumaroles, 

as opposed to any significant expansion of the fumarole field.  

Low and moderate temperature anomalies display a subtle gradual decrease followed by a 

sudden increase shortly before the eruption on 11
th

 December 2003. This is perhaps analogous to 

the behaviour of maximum temperatures before the 2006 eruption (Fig. 3.10b) as well as pre-

1993 cycles (Matthews et al. 1997) which have been described above, and may therefore 

represent a subtle thermal precursor. No high temperature anomalies are recorded at the time and 

a lack of nighttime scenes precludes the search for a similar pattern in the SWIR time series.  

 Four separate scenes contain high temperature anomalies within the 6 month period 

following the December 2003 eruption. This may reflect a post-eruptive increase in fumarolic 

activity, as was also inferred from the maximum temperature series. Low temperature anomalies 

show a general decrease in size from around October 2004 until the 4
th

 May 2005 eruption 



61 
 

ensues. This contraction may pertain to minor permeability decreases in the upper conduit and 

could be another example of a subtle thermal precursor. There was no apparent change in the size 

of moderate, high or SWIR anomalies before this eruption. Again this supports the hypothesis 

that the source of the eruption was fairly shallow and that the relationship between fluid 

overpressure and the mechanical strength of containing rock in the upper conduit was already 

somewhat critical. 

 

 

Figure 3.14. Increase in the size of low and high temperature anomalies and a consistently 

large SWIR anomaly precede an eruption of Láscar on 9th October 2002 eruption. All 

images are to the same scale and North is up. 

 

The low temperature anomaly series shows a distinct increase immediately after the penultimate 

eruptive episode (i.e. 4
th

 May 2005) and remains elevated up until the beginning of the last 

eruptive period on 3
rd

 April 2006. Conversely the moderate and SWIR anomalies display a 

similar pattern to that described for the maximum temperature series, i.e. a gradual decrease 

followed by an increase before eruption (Fig. 3.15). The onset of this increase occurs somewhere 

between 2 and 4 months before the start of the subsequent eruptive episode and is even 

accompanied by some high temperature anomalies. We suggest that degassing was an important 

component of these anomalies given the extension and spatial configuration of the 



62 
 

contemporaneous low temperature anomalies and since no lava dome was observed during field 

investigations carried out at the time (Bulletin of the Global Volcanism Network. Láscar. 2006).  

 

 

Figure 3.15. A gradual decrease followed by an increase in the size and intensity of thermal 

anomalies precedes a surprisingly intense and long lasting eruptive period at Láscar. All 

images are to the same scale and North is up. 

 

 The final eruptive period (April 2006  - July 2007) is characterized by consistent high 

temperature and SWIR anomalies that are confined to the centre of the active crater. It is possible 

that lava was emplaced at this time although, as mentioned previously, field investigation did not 

reveal the presence of a dome. Alternatively a high temperature fumarole field may have 

developed on the crater floor. This is consistent with contemporaneous chemical and isotopic 

analyses of gas emissions from Láscar, which show that fumaroles within the active crater have a 

stronger magmatic signature (i.e. high SO2, HCL and HF) than fumaroles that are situated on the 

crater rim (Tassi et al. 2009). Efficient degassing of the upper conduit appears to have been 

sustained throughout the eruptive period. An abrupt end to moderate, high and SWIR anomalies 

coincide with the end of the final eruptive period. We note that low temperature anomalies 

remain quite large in size for approximately 6 months after this eruptive period, suggestive of 

dispersed fumarolic activity. The remainder of the data set displays considerable variability in the 

size of low temperature anomalies. This may suggest that Láscar had entered a low level, 

intermittent degassing regime.

3.7 Discussion 

 

The maximum temperature above background and the size of anomalous areas are both measures 

that can provide insight into dynamic volcanic behaviour and therefore be useful in a monitoring 

context. The maximum pixel temperature however can be less meaningful for sub-pixel-sized 

lava bodies. Several factors that may cause the resultant scattered response have been discussed 

above. Here we briefly explore the dependence of the maximum pixel temperatures on the 

maximum fraction of the lava lake in a given pixel. We then go on to comment on the size and 

intensity of thermal anomalies and their potential monitoring value at other volcanoes.  

 

3.7.1. Scatter in maximum ?T at Erebus 

 

The spectral radiance, L( ,T), emitted by a surface is described by the Planck function: 

 

       (3.6) 

 

at wavelength   and thermodynamic temperature T, and where ?  is spectral emissivity, and c1 

and c2 are the radiation constants (i.e. c1 = 2?hc = 3.742×10
-16

 W m
2
 and c2 = hc/k = 1.439×10

-2
 m 

K; where h is the Planck constant, c the speed of light and k the Boltzmann constant). Assuming 

the spectral radiance and emissivity are known, the temperature of a remote surface can be 

estimated by rearranging: 

 

       (3.7) 

 

As the emissivity of our target area was not known we assumed a maximum of 0.97 and then 

applied the Normalized Emissivity Method (Realmuto, 1990) for temperature retrieval with 

equation 3.7. In practice, the resultant pixel-integrated temperature is weighted according to the 

bandpass function of the sensor and the Planck radiation distribution of the target. As the 

radiation emitted from a surface is non-linearly dependent on temperature (i.e. Eq. 6) any 

temperature retrieval will tend to diverge from the average temperature of subpixel thermal 



64 
 

components unless the target surface is isothermal. The magnitude of this divergence is usually 

small for typical terrestrial surfaces as targets tend to have limited sub-pixel thermal contrast and 

low temperatures (i.e. &amp;lt;100 °C; Garratt, 1992). However, it can be large in the presence of a high 

temperature feature with strong spatial variability (such as a fissured active lava surface). 

 To illustrate the effect that Erebus lava lake might have on a maximum pixel temperature 

we model the active crater as a three component, blackbody system made up of a crust of lava at 

500 °C which can have incandescent cracks at 900 °C (Calkins et al. 2008) and is surrounded by 

ground at -30°C. The lake can range in size from 700 to 1400 m
2
, the maximum fractional area of 

the lake within any given ASTER TIR pixel can therefore range between 2.2 and 17.3 %. The 

lower fractional limit is calculated by assuming that the smallest possible lake area can be equally 

divided between four pixels. The upper limit represents the situation in which the largest lake 

area is completely imaged within a single pixel. The maximum proportion of incandescent cracks 

within the lake is set as 0.1. This is because the maximum reported area of bubble burst (i.e. 60 

m
2
; Calkins et al. 2008) would occupy 8.6 % of the smallest modelled lake size. The average 

temperature of a 3 component thermal system is given by  

 

        (3.8) 

 

where f is the fractional area of a component at temperature T, and the subscripts h, c and b 

denote hot incandescent cracks, lava crust and non-active background, respectively. The 

measured pixel temperature (i.e. equation 3.7), on the other hand, depends on the sum of the 

individual radiance components (i.e. equation 3. 9), which is not linearly related to temperature 

and will therefore result in divergence between the measured and average temperature. 

 

      (3.9) 

 

where Ltotal is the total spectral radiance measured by a single detector element whose waveband 

has a mid-point at  , and L is the blackbody radiance emitted by isothermal components at 

temperatures Th, Tc and Tb. The maximum pixel temperature within a given scene will therefore 

not only depend on the physical properties of the target area but also on the maximum fractional 

area of the lava lake within an IFOV of a given detector element of a sensor array.  



65 
 

 Absorption of volcanic gas species (e.g. H2O and SO2) is not modelled here as it will have 

limited affect on temperatures calculated using the Normalized Emissivity Method. This is 

because the NEM algorithm automatically selects the band which has the largest brightness 

temperature and is therefore likely to avoid bands that have undergone significant amounts of 

wavelength dependent absorption. Field measurements have shown however that transmission 

across the TIR waveband (i.e. 7 - 13 ?m) is strongly attenuated by volcanic aerosols (Sawyer and 

Burton, 2006). This will affect temperature estimates as even the largest brightness temperatures 

will have been significantly reduced. We therefore model the dependence of pixel temperatures 

on the presence of aerosols as well, considering the case in which either a) no aerosols are present 

or b) aerosols cause a 30 % reduction in transmittance across all wavelengths (Fig. 3.16).  

 

 

Figure 3.16. Pixel temperature solutions (grey areas) for ASTER TIR bands as a function of 

the fractional area of a lava lake within a given pixel. The average temperature of sub-pixel 

components is given (solid blue lines). Aerosols can be either a) not present or b) cause a 

30% reduction in transmittance. The  maximum fractional area of the lake can range from 

0.022 to 0.173 (vertical dashed lines). Temperature ranges from ASTER bands 10 and 14 

are plotted as pairs of red and green lines respectively and denote response ranges for the 

cases in which incandescent material occupies zero or 0.1 of the lake. The saturation 

temperature of an ASTER TIR pixel, Tsat, is given as a horizontal red dotted line. 

 

 The pixel temperature solutions (grey areas) are sensitive to the fractional area of the lava 

lake and can exceed the actual temperature (blue lines) by several tens of degrees. Significant 

scatter in maximum temperatures could therefore be produced by small (i.e. sub-pixel sized) 



66 
 

variations in: lake size, spatial alignment between the target and pixel IFOVs, and the proportion 

of incandescent cracks within the lake. Aerosols can significantly reduce temperature solutions 

(Fig. 3.16b) and will act to provide further variability in maximum pixel temperatures. 

 

3.7.2. Background temperatures at other volcanoes 

 

The global distribution of volcanoes and their varying topographies and compositions can lead to 

markedly different background temperatures from one edifice to the next. A standardized method 

for measuring background temperatures would facilitate comparisons between volcanoes situated 

around the world. We attempt to make steps toward such a standardized approach by defining a 

background area that is situated as close to the region of activity as possible without becoming 

volcanically heated and while also meeting a minimum size constraint. For Erebus and Láscar 

volcanoes a ring shaped background area  was found to be suitable because activity is restricted 

to a single crater. However, different styles of volcanism (e.g. those with fissural morphologies, 

such as Erta 'Ale and Eyjafjallajökull) may require different background geometries (e.g. an 

ellipse).  

 To isolate a volcanic thermal signal it is necessary to estimate the background value. 

Furthermore, automatic anomaly detection requires that the natural variability in the background 

value is quantified. These can both be achieved in a straightforward, unbiased manner through 

the use of arithmetic averages and standard deviation. However, such background statistics could 

be compromised in the case that hot volcanic material (e.g. lava and/or pyroclastic flows) fall in 

the background area. For global monitoring applications it would therefore be necessary to screen 

automatically for anomalous pixels in the background area. This could be achieved through the 

use of in-scene statistics or expected background values as derived from time series analysis. It 

will probably be necessary to remove only the more extreme anomalies from the background area 

as subtle anomalies are unlikely to affect background statistics significantly. This is because hot 

volcanic products, such as lava and pyroclastic flows, tend to be channelized and narrow in size 

close to their source region. As such they will occupy very small proportions of a background 

area that encircles the entire source region. 

 

 



67 
 

3.7.3. Monitoring implications 

 

Two clear thermal precursors and two subtle thermal precursors were identified in the Láscar 

time series. The well-defined precursors are i) an increase in the size of low, moderate and high 

temperature anomalies as well as consistently large SWIR anomalies for the 6 - 9 months 

preceding the 9
th

 October 2002 eruptive episode, and ii) a gradual decrease, followed by an 

increase, in the size of moderate temperature anomalies which is accompanied by high 

temperature anomalies for roughly 3 months preceding the final eruptive period (i.e. start date 3
rd

 

April 2006). The subtle thermal anomalies consisted of i) a gradual decrease followed by a 

sudden increase in the size of low and moderate temperature anomalies before the 11th December 

2003 eruptive episode, and ii) a gradual decrease in low temperature anomalies over an ~6 month 

period preceding the 4
th

 May 2005 eruption. Monitoring efforts at Láscar could thus be usefully 

augmented by systematic spaceborne remote sensing in the future, especially given that the 

thermal precursors span timescales of a few months and therefore could have predictive value.  

 We envisage that measuring the size and intensity of thermal anomalies will provide 

useful constraints for volcano monitoring teams in general. For example, the detection of a large, 

hot body would suggest significant activity has recently occurred and may indicate the presence 

of a lava flow or fresh pyroclastic material. The distinction between plumes and lava flows may 

also be facilitated by the joint measurement of spatial and thermal information. Plumes will tend 

to be relatively low in temperature, extensive, irregular shaped, dynamic regions while lava flows 

will tend to display higher temperatures and more consistent boundaries through time which have 

either point (i.e. dome) or lobate (i.e. flow) geometries. Such distinction, however, will often be 

inconclusive for sub-pixel sized bodies as no spatial information is available and strong thermal 

heterogeneities can lead to unreliable pixel temperatures at this spectral resolution. Significant 

post-eruptive changes in the size and or intensity of thermal anomalies can help to identify the 

end of an eruptive episode. This is important because the duration of an eruptive episode has been 

shown to be statistically related to both the repose time as well as the size of the next eruption 

(Marzocchi and Zaccarelli, 2006). 

 

 

 



68 
 

3.8. Conclusion 

 

The spatial extent of anomalously hot pixels was introduced as a monitoring parameter for active  

volcanoes. Comparisons were made to short-wave infrared anomalies as well as to a previously 

reported thermal metric (i.e. the maximum temperature above background). We show that the 

size of anomalous regions better correlates to eruptive activity than maximum temperature alone. 

Measuring the size and intensity of thermal features can be used to improve our understanding of 

volcanic systems by direct observation, as in this study, or through incorporation into 

probabilistic or physical models. Future algorithms for volcanic activity detection may include a 

search for thermal anomalies which exceed a certain size and/or intensity. We note that such 

observations are only possible because of ASTER's combined spatial and spectral resolution. 

Even so, future studies would benefit from a new generation of orbital, infrared sensors with 

improved spatial resolution, such as NASA's proposed HyspIRI mission (Chien et al. 2009). Pixel 

saturation issues could also be mitigated by extending the dynamic range of detector elements.

MODIS and ASTER Synergy for Characterizing Thermal Volcanic Activity 

 

 

S. W. Murphy, R. Wright, C. Oppenheimer , C.R. de Souza Filho 

Published in Remote Sensing of Environment, 131, 195-205, 2013. 

 

 

4.1. Abstract 

 

Volcanic activity is diverse in its manifestations and spans wide temporal and spatial scales.  

Monitoring volcanoes with any single sensor system can only provide a limited perspective on 

the nature of such activity because of trade-offs between spatial, temporal and spectral resolution.  

Spaceborne observations of volcanoes are thus optimised by utilising data from different and 

complementary remote sensing instruments.  This study examines the combined use of the 

Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Advanced Spaceborne 

Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) for analyzing thermal anomalies from 

four separate volcanoes: Erta ‘Ale (Ethiopia), K?lauea (Hawai'i), Láscar (Chile) and Kliuchevskoi  

(Russia).  MODIS provides a high temporal resolution (daily) but low spatial resolution (~ 1 km) 

dataset and is used to measure volcanic thermal radiance.  ASTER provides relatively high spatial 

resolution (~ 90 m) image data and is used to define the size of thermal features, albeit at a poorer 



70 
 

temporal frequency.  Erta ‘Ale and  K?lauea  have been erupting continuously over the 11-year 

study period and their thermal emission signatures reveal a persistent  baseline  on  which  

occasional  increases  in  thermal  output,  associated  with  more profuse effusions of lava, are 

superimposed. Kliuchevskoi also displays occasional peaks in thermal activity due to the eruption 

of lava however intervening periods are characterized by weak or absent thermal anomalies.  

Láscar, on the other hand, provides an example of volcanic activity that is difficult for MODIS-

type sensors to detect.  It is characterized by fumarolic activity that is too low in temperature and 

too spatially limited to be readily detectable with its coarser instantaneous field of view (i.e., 

pixel size). However, high resolution data from ASTER can be used to supplement and 

complement the MODIS dataset. Beyond characterizing the size of thermally anomalies ASTER 

can also provide constraints on their shape, location and orientation and is capable of detecting 

relatively subtle thermal anomalies given its high spatial resolution thermal infrared wavebands.  

These qualities permitted the identification of a thermal precursor to lava flows at Kliuchevskoi. 

The precursor, which was associated with a rising lava lake, is characterized as an increase in the 

size and intensity of ASTER-detected thermal anomalies situated in the active crater. Wavelet 

analysis of the MODIS dataset was also carried out.  This revealed the time scales over which 

radiant output waxed and waned during individual eruptive episodes as well as the repose time 

between episodes. Such information might be useful in forecasting the likely duration and onset 

of future eruptions. 

 

4.2. Introduction 

 

Volcanoes can be hazardous to both people and property yet also provide valuable insights into 

dynamic processes on Earth. It is necessary to monitor active volcanoes to mitigate the risks that 

they pose and to improve our understanding of these complex physical systems.   

 Volcanic activity involves the transfer of mass and heat to the Earth’s surface. The surface 

temperature and emissivity of a physical body determine the amount of energy it radiates at any 

given wavelength.  Planck’s law describes this relationship, which is modified to account for 

spectral emissivity as follows:

where  L( ,T)   is  spectral  radiance  (W m

)  as  a function  of wavelength  ( ) and  

kinetic temperature (T), ?  is spectral emissivity, and c1 and c2 are the radiation constants 

(i.e., c1 = 2hc

 and c2 = hc/k = 1.439?10

constant, c the speed of light and k the Boltzmann constant). 

 This work explores the use of polar-orbiting satellites for monitoring volcanic thermal 

radiance from space. The types of sensors used for this purpose can be classified into two broad 

categories: i) high to moderate spatial resolution (i.e., &amp;lt;100 m pixel
-1

) but low temporal 

resolution (i.e., &gt; 10 day) imagers, and ii) high temporal (i.e., 1 ? day) but low spatial resolution 

(i.e., ? 1 km) imagers. The two categories will be referred to as i) high spatial resolution and ii) 

high temporal resolution for the remainder of this article. We note that although the meaning of 

adjectives such as ‘advanced’, ‘high’ and ‘moderate’ change with time as far as capabilities are 

concerned they have still been used widely to name many of the existing orbital imagers. High 

spatial resolution systems that have been used to monitor volcanic thermal radiance include: the 

Thematic Mapper onboard Landsat 4 and 5 (e.g.,, Francis and Rothery, 1987; Rothery et al., 

1988; Glaze et al., 1989; Oppenheimer, 1991), the Optical Sensor on the Japanese Earth 

Resources Satellite-1 (JERS-1) (e.g., Denniss et al., 1996, Dean et al., 1998), the Enhanced 

Thematic Mapper Plus on Landsat 7 (e.g., Flynn et al., 2001; Wright et al., 2001; Patrick et al., 

2004), the Advanced Land Imager on the Earth Observing-1 mission (e.g., Donegan and Flynn, 

2004), and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) 

onboard the Terra satellite (e.g., Vaughan and Hook, 2006; Rose and Ramsey, 2009, Murphy et 

al., 2011). On the other hand high temporal resolution polar orbiters include: the Advanced Very 

High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) flown on the NOAA satellite series (e.g., Harris et al., 

1997, Tramutoli, 1998), and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (e.g., 

Wright et al., 2002; Wright et al., 2004; Kervyn, 2008; Koeppen et al., 2011) onboard both the 

Terra and Aqua satellites. The temporal and spectral resolution of MODIS, as well as its global 

coverage and reliable geometric and radiometric calibration, led to its application in the world’s 

first automated system for global volcano monitoring, i.e., MODVOLC (Wright et al., 2002; 

Wright et al., 2004).

 Volcanic phenomena span a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. It may take years, 

decades or longer for magma to migrate to the surface, whilst a pyroclastic flow can be emplaced 

in minutes.  A volcanic ash plume can extend over thousands of kilometres yet ejecta are 

typically metre scale or less. This disparity means that there is no single sensor in existence that 

is capable of acquiring data over the spatial and temporal scales exhibited by all of Earth’s 

volcanoes. Volcano monitoring efforts therefore need to integrate and interrogate data from 

networks of sensors. From a volcanologist’s perspective an ideal network would include 

terrestrial, airborne and spaceborne sensors. In practice, since most of Earth’s potentially active 

and active volcanoes are subject to at best only rudimentary ground-based monitoring, orbital 

sensors are a crucial data source for tracking global volcanism. 

 The  Terra  satellite,  which  carries  both  the  ASTER  and a MODIS  system,  offers an 

excellent opportunity to explore the potential of combining both high spatial and high temporal 

resolution datasets for monitoring volcanoes from space (e.g., Vaughan and Hook, 2006, Hirn et 

al., 2008, Vaughan et al., 2008). The ASTER sensor consists of three separate subsystems in the 

visible and near-infrared (VNIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR) and thermal infrared (TIR) with 

respective pixel sizes of 15, 30 and 90 m. The SWIR subsystem ceased to provide useful Earth 

observation data in 2008 due to a cooler malfunction although the VNIR and TIR instruments 

continue to operate normally. MODIS has 32 spectral channels in the VNIR, SWIR, mid infrared 

(MIR) and TIR wavelengths with nominal pixel resolutions ranging from 250, 500 and 1000 m. 

Temporal resolution for all channels is 24 hours. Multiple simultaneous viewing opportunities are 

possible as both sensors are carried by the same satellite platform. 

 The aim of this work is to compare how two different sensor classes report the temporal, 

spatial and thermal characteristics of a range of target volcanoes. The targets were chosen 

because they display different eruptive characteristics and would therefore be useful in testing the 

performance of high temporal resolution (i.e. MODIS class) and high spatial resolution (i.e. 

ASTER class) sensor systems at cataloguing different styles of volcanic activity. The term "style" 

here is simplified to mean whether thermal activity is any of the following: low temperature, high 

temperature, small, large, persistent or not persistent. A decadal time series has been used to a 

give a longer term perspective on this.

4.3. Study Areas 

  

Four different volcanoes have been investigated: i) K?lauea (Hawai'i), ii) Láscar (Chile), iii)  Erta 

‘Ale (Ethiopia)  and  iv)  Kliuchevskoi  (Kamchatka,  Russia).  Each site represents a markedly 

different type of volcanic setting: i) intra-plate ‘hot spot’ volcanism with frequent effusive 

basaltic eruptions (K?lauea), ii) a continental-oceanic subduction zone with persistent degassing, 

sporadic lava dome growth and intermittent explosions (Láscar), iii) a continental rift zone with 

an active lava lake (Erta ‘Ale) and iv) a volcanic arc (Kliuchevskoi). These sites were selected for 

their contrasted settings and eruptive styles, enabling a more thorough evaluation of the 

capabilities and limitations of each sensor. 

  

4.4. Metrics for Volcanic Thermal Activity 

  

This study was concerned with the characterization of thermally anomalous surfaces. Two 

metrics that quantify different aspects of such surfaces are defined. The first (MOD*) uses 

MODIS data to describe spectral intensity. The second (AST*) estimates the size of anomalous 

areas using the ASTER sensor. 

   

4.4.1. MOD* (High temporal resolution volcanic radiance) 

  

The MODIS dataset used in this study is comprised of all the available nighttime, calibrated 

radiance scenes (i.e., MOD021KM) and their corresponding geolocation products (i.e., MOD03) 

acquired for each volcano by MODIS-Terra since its launch in 1999. These data are available 

from the Level 1 and Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System (LAADS) maintained by the 

NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Over the study period (i.e., 1 January 2000 to 1 January 

2012) there are 3709 scenes for Erta ‘Ale, 5391 scenes for Kliuchevskoi, 4261 scenes for K?lauea 

and 3772 scenes for Láscar (i.e., a total of 17,133 MOD02 1KM scenes). The combined size of 

this data set (i.e., 1.7 Tb) was reduced by cropping scenes and selecting pertinent spectral 

channels.   

 The MOD* metric is designed to represent the overall amount of MIR radiance from 

thermally anomalous areas. Given the IFOV of the MODIS instrument the vast majority of 



74 
 

thermal anomalies will be subpixel in size. A radiance measurement from a single detector 

element will therefore often contain contributions from volcanically active areas and non-active 

background areas. We have used channel 21 (i.e., 3.929 - 3.989 µm)  to characterize the radiance 

from volcanically active areas and channel 32 (i.e., 11.77 - 12.270 µm) to characterize the 

radiance from non-active background areas. This is because MIR detector arrays 

(e.g., channel 21) are much more sensitive to volcanic temperatures (i.e., hundreds of degrees 

Celsius) than TIR detector arrays (e.g., channel 32). To illustrate this point let us consider an 

isothermal background surface at 20 
o
C that occupies the entire IFOV of detector elements in 

channel 21 and 32; the radiance from each channel will be 0.5 and 8.1 W m
-2

 sr
-1

 ?m
-1

, 

respectively. In the case that the IFOV also contained a second isothermal surface with a 

temperature of 500 
o
C  and area of 100 m

2
 (i.e., 0.01% of MODIS pixel) then the radiance from 

each channel would be 11.72 and 9.32, respectively. That is, the TIR radiance in channel 32 will 

increase by 14.8% whilst the MIR radiance in channel 21 will increase by 2232%. The MOD* 

metric uses this relationship to define anomalous radiance in channel 21 as follows: 

 

        (4.2) 

 

where n is the number of anomalous pixels, Li  is the spectral radiance and Li,bkgd  the background 

spectral radiance of the i
th

 anomalous pixel in channel 21. The background radiance was 

calculated by using the brightness temperature in channel 32 as a proxy for the temperature of the 

non-active background areas. This background temperature (i.e., from TIR wavelengths) was 

then used to calculate background radiance (i.e., in MIR wavelengths) for channel 21. A pixel is 

considered to be anomalous if its Normalized Thermal Index (i.e., NTI) exceeds a threshold 

value. The NTI (equation 4.3) utilizes the relative sensitivity of MIR and TIR wavelengths 

outlined above to detect thermally active volcanic targets from space (Wright et al. 2002). 

 

         (4.3) 

 



75 
 

where  L22 and L32 are  spectral  radiance  measurements  from  MODIS  channels  22  and  32, 

respectively. MODIS channels 22 and 21 cover the same spectral region but have different 

saturation limits (i.e., brightness temperatures of around 60 and 225 
o
C, respectively) and 

radiometric accuracy (i.e., noise equivalent temperature variation, NE?T, of 0.07 and 2.0 K, 

respectively). If saturation occurs in channel 22 then radiance from channel 21 was automatically 

used instead. A global threshold of -0.8 was proposed by Wright et al. (2004) to identify volcanic 

thermally anomalies from nighttime MODIS scenes. This global threshold was set relatively high 

to avoid false alarms. To increase anomaly detection sensitivity it is possible to define volcano-

specific thresholds (e.g., Kervyn, 2008, Koeppen et al., 2011). To find an optimal local NTI 

threshold we first calculated the frequency distribution of all NTI values for each volcano 

(Fig. 4.1).  

 

 

Figure 4.1. The frequency distribution of MODIS Normalized Thermal Index (NTI) at a) 

Erta ‘Ale, b) K?lauea, c) Kliuchevskoi and d) Láscar. Optimal local anomaly thresholds are 

shown using a solid, red line. The global MODVOLC threshold is shown using a dashed, 

grey line for comparison. 



76 
 

 

 The NTI values that correspond to volcanic hot-spots represent a tiny percentage of pixels 

at the extreme right hand tail of the distribution, pixels that are not anomalous will correspond 

almost exclusively to NTI values in the rest of the distribution. An optimal threshold needs to be 

found to limit the number of false positives and missed anomalies. This was achieved by 

checking that the spatial distribution of anomalies was reasonable throughout the time series (Fig. 

4.2) and that anomalies did not display seasonal variations through time (Fig. 4.3).  The 

bimodality of the K?lauea histogram (Fig. 4.1b) is due the presence of both land and water in the 

area used to calculate local NTI values at this volcano. The location of anomalous pixels were 

recorded on a scene by scene basis and anomaly frequency maps were calculated for each 

volcano (Fig. 4.2). 

These maps depict the frequency with which an anomalous NTI value was detected at a 

given location over an 11 year period. Zero frequency areas are filled in using MODIS visible 

wavebands to provide a geographic context. Local NTI histograms (Fig. 4.1) were calculated 

from the entirety of scenes depicted in Figure 4.2, the MOD* time series was calculated from 

smaller areas outlined using a white, dashed box. Figure 4.2a shows that activity at Erta ‘Ale is 

confined to the summit caldera. The fairly large (i.e., several km
2
) but low frequency region to 

the NNW is associated with the Alu-Dalaffilla fissure eruption of November 2008. Activity at 

K?lauea is more spatially extensive and mainly corresponds with the lavas erupted on the 

volcano’s East Rift Zone (Fig. 4.2b). Dotted around the Big Island are areas which contained 

short-lived thermal activity (i.e., low probability areas). They have previously been interpreted as 

resulting from vegetation fires (Koeppen et al., 2011). This might also be the cause of similar low 

probability areas surrounding Kliuchevskoi (Fig. 4.2c). Volcanic anomalies can be observed over 

both Kliuchevskoi and Bezymianny. Láscar’s thermal features are constrained solely to the active 

summit crater (Fig. 4.2d). Clearly anomaly frequency maps display the likely location of 

thermally anomalous areas over time, as such, they might be useful during hazard planning 

exercises. They also help more generally to distinguish effusive activity (i.e., K?lauea) from lava 

domes or lakes situated in craters (i.e., Láscar and Erta ‘Ale ). Kliuchevskoi combines both types 

of behaviour. Thus, even if we knew nothings about these volcanoes beforehand it would be 

possible from Figure 4.2 to determine that they represent different types of volcanic activity. 

Annual anomaly frequency maps for each volcano are provided in the supplementary material.

 4.4.2. AST* (Size of anomalous areas) 

 

This study uses the ASTER TIR at-surface radiance product (AST_09T) which is geometrically, 

radiometrically, and atmospherically corrected by the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive 

Center (LP  DAAC) of  the United States  Geological  Survey (USGS).  We obtain terrestrial 



78 
 

surface temperatures from this product using the Normalized Emissivity Method (Realmuto, 

1990) with maximum emissivity set to 0.97. The ASTER Surface Kinetic Temperature (AST_08) 

product, which is based on the Temperature Emissivity Separation (i.e. TES) algorithm (Gillespie 

et al. 1998), was not used in this study because we could not verify whether the empirical 

relationship between laboratory-derived emissivity values and spectral contrast would apply in an 

active volcanic setting. An inspection for cloud cover was carried out on the temperature image. 

If clouds completely obscured the volcano so that it could not be located visually in a TIR image 

then that scene was removed from the dataset.   

 The AST* metric utilizes the relatively high spatial resolution of the ASTER sensor to 

measure the size of thermally anomalous areas. 

 

         (4.4) 

 

where A is the nominal area of an ASTER pixel (i.e., 8100 m
2
) and n* is the number of 

anomalous pixels in a given scene. ASTER pixels were identified as anomalous if their 

temperature above background exceeded 40 
o
C. This threshold was selected to ensure an 

extremely low false alarm rate (i.e., perhaps zero) and to avoid the incorporation of too many 

ephemeral, low temperature gas plumes. The motivation for filtering cool gas plumes is that they 

can change dramatically in size on time scales that are orders of magnitude greater than the 

revisit time of the sensor (i.e., minutes compared to days or weeks) and will therefore produce 

scatter in the data that masks other, more persistent thermal features. 

 Even at the spatial resolution of ASTER TIR bands (i.e., 90 m) it is likely that its 

individual detector elements will measure radiance from surfaces at markedly different 

temperatures over hot volcanic targets. Any one pixel temperature will therefore give only a 

qualitative measure of volcanic thermal heating. However, given that the AST* metric is 

restricted to measuring the size of thermally anomalous areas, it remains robust against this effect 

of subpixel thermal mixing. Although anomalous pixels could be identified using pixel radiance 

instead of pixel temperature we have utilized the latter because it is more robust against 

potentially variable spectral emissivity profiles as well as wavelength dependent absorption 

features (e.g. due to SO2 or ash aerosols). ASTER TIR channels will saturate quite frequently 

over hot volcanic targets (i.e., saturation brightness temperatures ? 97 
o
C), especially given their 



79 
 

relatively small IFOV, this issue was also avoided by limiting the AST* metric to measuring just 

the size of thermal anomalies. 

 The temperature above background was calculated by subtracting a background 

temperature from the NEM temperature array. The background temperature was defined as the 

average pixel temperature in the background area. This area was defined as an annulus around the 

active crater at Erta ‘Ale, Kliuchevskoi and Láscar and as a collection of user-defined points at 

K?lauea. The methodology for determining the optimal size of an annulus is described in detail by 

Murphy et al. (2011). Hot volcanic features (e.g., lava or pyroclastic flows) occasionally crossed 

the background area (i.e., at Kliuchevskoi). The corresponding pixels were automatically 

screened from the background area using a threshold of twice the standard deviation of the entire 

temperature array (i.e., an area of ~ 62 km
2
). The search area used to find anomalous ASTER 

pixels included (and extended beyond) the background area to ensure that all volcanic thermal 

features were included in the AST* metric.  

 Lava flows, pyroclastic flows and ash/gas plumes typically travel in a preferred direction 

from a stratocone due to local topography or wind direction. The 2D projection that these features 

create in an image acquired from space could, for illustrative purposes, be defined as a narrow arc 

(&amp;lt;20
o
) originating from the active crater. The relative magnitude of the area of intersection 

between an arc (i.e. an active volcanic feature) and an annulus (i.e. the background area) and the 

total area of the annulus is given by: 

 

          (4.5) 

 

where ? is the area of intersection, A is the size of the background area, and   is the angular 

width of the arc in radians. For a 20
o
 arc (i.e., 0.35 radians) the area of intersect would be 5.6% of 

the background area. Therefore pixels which contain contributions from cold ash plumes or warm 

volcanogenic material (i.e., that were not hot enough to be automatically removed by the clipping 

procedure) would still have a limited effect on the background temperature. The geometry of an 

annulus is therefore naturally stable against the intrusion of fresh volcanogenic material. 

Furthermore the circular nature of the annulus acts towards balancing the preferential solar 

heating effects that are created by varying amounts of solar irradiance around the volcanic 



80 
 

edifice. Therefore the annulus approach for calculating background temperatures from 

stratocones is favoured in this work. At the K?lauea shield volcano, which frequently exhibits 

active lava flow fields covering several km
2
, the annulus approach was not possible. The 

background area was therefore defined as a collection of user-defined points around the flow 

field in this case. We note that a single background  temperature cannot accurately characterise 

such an extensive area given that significant, non-volcanic variations in terrestrial temperatures 

occur across it. The annulus methodology (i.e., used for all volcanoes but K?lauea) is estimated to 

provide background temperatures to within 5 
o
C based on inspection of radial temperature 

gradients from the active crater. This method is described in detail by Murphy et al. (2011). The 

user-defined points (i.e., used for K?lauea only) give background temperatures to within 15 
o
C 

(i.e. twice the maximum standard deviation of the background data points). 

 

4.5. Wavelet Analysis 

 

Wavelet analysis reveals the periodicity in a time series of data. A wavelet (?) is a wave function 

of finite duration (i.e., it is localized). The Morlet wavelet was used with a central frequency of 

six for this study. A continuous wavelet transform will convert data from the time domain to a 

time-frequency domain through the convolution of a time series with translated (i.e. moved in 

time) and scaled (i.e. stretched) versions of the original wavelet function. This involves 

evaluating the integral of the product of the data points with the wavelet function. Conceptually 

this equates to quantifying the amount of overlap between the area under the curve defined by the 

data points and the area under the curve defined by the wavelet function. Power is the metric of 

this overlap. As power is calculated for a range of translation and scale parameters the resulting 

wavelet transform will represent how well the wavelet and the data match at different locations in 

time and at different periods of oscillation. A period of oscillation is the length of time over 

which an oscillation occurs (i.e., it is equivalent to the reciprocal of frequency). Power was 

normalized by the maximum value in each transform. This provides a unitless measure of 

periodicity that varies from zero to one. A practical guide to wavelet analysis is given by 

Torrence and Campo (1998). Examples of wavelet analysis in volcanology include studies of  

thermal image data from handheld infrared cameras (Spampinato et al., 2012) and geochemical 

time series measuring plume composition (Oppenheimer et al., 2009; Boichu et al., 2010).  



81 
 

4.6. Results  

 

4.6.1. Time series  

 

Figure 4.3 shows the entire MOD*and AST* datasets. They span the period between 24 February 

2000 (i.e., the first available scene) to 1 January 2012. Erta ‘Ale and K?lauea (Fig. 4.3 a,b) have 

been erupting continuously over the study period. Kliuchevskoi and Láscar (Fig. 4.3 c,d) 

underwent intermittent eruptive episodes that are displayed using pink shading.  Eruptive 

histories are mostly obtained from reports of the Global Volcanism Program of the Smithsonian 

Institute (Venzke et al., 2002 - ). 

Erta ‘Ale was frequently active throughout the 11 year study period. MOD* values are 

generally below 5 W m

 µm

  (i.e., 99.3 % of data points), although peaks in thermal output 

do occasionally exceed this values (i.e., up to a maximum MOD* of 14.4). There are two periods 

were MOD* values remain close to zero for months at a time (i.e., June - November 2003 and 

October 2004 to April 2005). This may indicate that the height of the lava lake was particularly 

low during these periods. Conversely, episodes characterized by high lava lake levels - as 

observed in the field (e.g., November 2010 overflow) - correspond with peaks in MOD* values 

(i.e., 7.0 in this case). Variations in lava lake height are controlled by a number of factors, 

including magma reservoir pressure, vesiculation and conduit-crater morphology.   

 The size of the thermal anomaly, as given by the AST* metric, varies between roughly 

1 - 4 × 10
5
 m

2
 (i.e., 1 - 5 ASTER pixels). The linear Pearson correlation coefficient between 

AST* and MOD* is 0.54. That is, the size of thermally anomalous areas as measured by ASTER 

does not show a particularly strong correlation with the MIR radiance measured by MODIS. This 

is because the radiance emitted from the lava lake varies considerably more than the size of the 

lava lake. Radiant output can change significantly for a given lake area, for example, through 

convective overturning of the lake surface and bubble burst, both of which result in varying 

exposure of hot, incandescent material through time.

K?lauea is the most consistently active volcano in this study and is characterized by 

frequent fissure, flank and crater eruptions of low viscosity basalt lava. These effusive eruptions 

often result in tube fed flows that are capable of travelling several kilometres from the source 

vent. Consequently the MOD* time series displays a relatively high average of

 (i.e. coincident with outbreaks from 

the lava tubes). Several episodes of elevated thermal emission are apparent (e.g., January-

September 2005, July 2007 to April 2008, and July 2008). The latest of these is particularly 

significant because it was the largest in the data set (i.e., MOD* of 232; 7
th

 July 2008), it 

occurred during the eruption of three simultaneously lava fountains (BGVN 2010) and yet was 

completely missed by the ASTER sensor.  

 Although high spatial resolution imagers, such as ASTER, are more likely to miss such 

short lived dynamic events, the imagery that they provide offer superior constraints on the size, 

shape, orientation and location of thermal anomalies. For example, a lava flow field imaged 

simultaneously by both sensors on 7 June 2003 (Fig. 4.4) exhibits individual lava tubes of 

varying age that clearly form an interconnected network in the ASTER image (Fig. 4.4a), whilst 

it is only possible to determine the orientation and length of the overall flow field in the MODIS 

image (Fig. 4.4b).

 June 2003. ASTER is able to characterize the size, 

shape, location and orientation of individual lava flow tubes. 



84 
 

High spatial resolution data, as exemplified here by ASTER, would clearly be more 

useful for operational assessment of i) damage to local infrastructure (e.g., buildings, roads, etc.), 

ii) future flow direction (especially given that surface breakouts occur from the tubes), and iii) the 

risk of fire (e.g., through proximity to combustible material), given timely availability of the 

image, or a high-level monitoring product derived from the image. 

  The size of thermal anomalies at K?lauea have a mean AST* value of 8.9 x 10
5
 m

2
 (i.e., 

110 pixels) with a standard deviation of 9.6 x 10
5
 m

2
 (i.e., 118 pixels). They can therefore be very 

large yet also vary significantly in size through time. The most extensive anomaly in the AST* 

series is 5.55 ×10
6
 m

2
 (i.e., 685 pixels). The correlation coefficient between AST* and MOD* is 

0.65 (i.e. anomaly size and MIR radiance are more closely matched at this volcano than at Erta 

‘Ale). 

 Kliuchevskoi exhibits a more sporadic eruptive style, often spending prolonged periods of 

time with no, or very limited signs of thermal activity (Fig. 4.3c). There are four major peaks in 

the MOD* series i) 20 January to 7 April 2005, ii) 22 April to 25 June 2007, iii) 30 October 2008 

to 10 January 2009, and iv) 1 November 2009 to 1 November 2010. These correspond with 

Strombolian eruptions and lava flows (Venzke et al., 2002 - ). The first three major peaks are 

fairly symmetric and last around 2-3 months. The forth is asymmetric and last for about a year, 

with a prolonged period of Strombolian activity, followed by more extensive lava flows and 

culminating in a Vulcanian eruption (Venzke et al., 2002 - ) after which time thermal activity 

came to an abrupt end. 

  The maximum MOD* values for the symmetric peaks are, in consecutive order: 88.6, 

145.8 and 144.9. These peaks have mean MOD* values of 10.4, 30.0 and 11.8, respectively.  The 

forth major peak displays a higher maximum MOD* value (i.e., 166.7) and a lower mean MOD* 

value (6.9). The maximum extents of thermal anomalies during these four major episodes range 

from 5.6 x 10
5
 to 9.6 x 10

5
 m

2
. That is, they are comparable in size of K?lauea flows, although 

overall slightly smaller. Correlation between AST* and MOD* is relatively high overall (i.e. 

0.85). The increased correlation between size and intensity at Kliuchevskoi compared to K?lauea 

is probably because lava flows from Kliuchevskoi’s stratocone do not form tubes. At K?lauea 

however the formation of tubes means that radiance from these flows will depend on the 

proportion of exposed to concealed lava. 



85 
 

 Inspection of ASTER scenes reveals a thermal precursor to two of the lava flow events 

(Fig. 4.5).  The precursor is defined by thermal anomalies that are situated within the summit 

crater and that increase in both size and intensity through time. The increase in size is interpreted 

as resulting from an increasing amount of ponded lava in the active crater, as has been observed 

in the field (BGVN 2009).  

 

 

Figure 4.5. Thermal precursors to lava flow activity at Kliuchevskoi are characterized by 

anomalies in the active crater that increase in size and intensity. 

 

 The increase in intensity is due to greater radiant heat loss from the lava surface, which is 

dependent on both size and temperature. After the precursory infilling of the summit crater, lava 

breached the crater rim and descended the flanks of the volcano (BGVN 2007,2009). Such 

observations could be used to create simple, automated thermal precursors to lava flow activity at 

Kliuchevskoi and other similar volcanoes. If, for example, an alert had been based on detection of 

5 or more pixels situated in the active crater with a temperature above background of at least 40 

o
C, then both lava flow events could have been anticipated two weeks before they were seen 

descending the flank. This demonstrates the utility that moderate to high spatial resolution 

datasets  can  provide  when  their  revisit  periods  are  adequate  to  capture  changing  levels  of 

activity. 

 Láscar displays very low MOD*, i.e., mainly lower than 0.5 and with a maximum of 2.5 

(Fig. 4.3d). Scatter in MODIS anomalies, created by imperfect correction for MIR background 

radiance and atmospheric effects, can result in negative anomaly values. Thermal activity at this 

volcano, characterized by persistent degassing from fumaroles in and around the active crater, is 

particularly difficult for low spatial resolution sensors such as MODIS to detect because the 



86 
 

thermally active region is low in temperature, and relatively small in size compared to the 

instantaneous field of view (IFOV) of the sensor. Consequentially the radiation falling on any 

one detector element contains a limited contribution from the target area. ASTER, on the other 

hand, regularly detects thermal anomalies at Láscar. AST* values range from roughly 10,000 to 

40,000 m
2
 in size. These anomalies are probably due to varying degrees of fumarolic activity 

from the active crater (Murphy et al. 2011). The higher spatial resolution (i.e. smaller  IFOV)  of  

ASTER  allows  it  to  detect  relatively subtle thermal anomalies. Figure 4.6 illustrates this point 

by displays an ASTER image of a persistent thermal anomaly in Láscar’s active crater (Fig. 4.6a) 

juxtaposed with a contemporaneous MODIS image acquired over the same area (Fig. 4.6b). The 

anomaly is evident in the ASTER image yet remains completely undetected by the MODIS 

sensor.

4.6.2. Wavelet Power Spectra 

 

The high temporal resolution of MODIS lends itself to more detailed time series analysis.  A 

continuous wavelet transform was applied to the MOD* time series of a) Erta ‘Ale, b) K?lauea 

and c) Kliuchevskoi (Fig. 4.7). Shown for each volcano are i) the original MOD* time series, and 

ii) the wavelet power spectrum.  

 The axes of the wavelet power spectrum are time against period of oscillation. Time is 

plotted in years (x-axis) and period of oscillation is plotted in years (left y-axis) using a log base 

2 scale and also in the equivalent amount of days (right y-axis).  Power is represented using a 

colour scale. Peaks in the power spectrum (i.e. warmer colours) indicate periodicity in the time 

series at the corresponding time and period of oscillation. During the convolution process 

wavelets may be translated towards (or beyond) the edge of the finite time series, especially at 

longer periods, producing spurious results in the corresponding part of the power spectrum. This 

region is known as the cone of influence and is represented in grey to leave only the reliable part 

of the power spectrum visible. Certain instances in time are highlighted in the power spectrum 

using a vertical, dashed white line. The corresponding period against power plot for each of these 

time slices is displayed in Figure 4.8. 

 Erta ‘Ale (Fig. 4.7aii) displays two time intervals revealing a periodicity of approximately 

1/2 a year centred around June 2002 and August 2007. The latter event also shows significant 

periodicity at 1/16 to 1/4 of a year (i.e., 23 - 91 days). A time slice of the power spectrum at these 

two times (i.e. time slice 1 and 2) is displayed in Figure 4.8. These time slices also clearly show 

low period signals (i.e. around 2 days) that are approximately contemporaneous with sharp peaks 

in the MOD* time series (Fig. 4.7ai). A strong periodicity (i.e., power = 0.93) occurs at a long 

period (i.e., 4 years) around the turn of 2006 (Fig 4.7aii). It is associated with the spacing 

between the two periodicity events highlighted in time slice 1 and 2. This spacing is actually 

closer to 5 years than 4 but is not definable within this power spectrum because the 

corresponding periodicity falls into the cone of influence. To characterize longer period events, 

such as this one, it is necessary to have a longer time series. Less prominent peaks also appear in 

the power spectrum of Erta ‘Ale. Most remarkable among these are perhaps the dual periodicity 

component at 6.16 x 10
-3

 and 2.3 x 10
-2

 years (i.e., 2 and 8 days) because they reoccur throughout 



88 
 

much of the time series and therefore appear to be characteristic periods of oscillation at this 

volcano.

slices of the power spectrum (shown in Fig. 4.8) are depicted here using dashed white lines.   



89 
 

Figure 4.8. Time slices of wavelet power against period. 

  

   K?lauea displays strong periodicity at a period of 2.5 years with maximum power of this 

feature occurring around October 2006 (Fig. 4.7bii). This long period signal is overlain at 

different times with shorter period oscillations. Time slices 3 and 4 (Fig. 4.8) display some of the 

multiple periodicity components in the K?lauea power spectrum. The long  (i.e. 2.5 year) period 

is the dominant feature in these time slices however both also show periodicity at around 1/4 of a 

year and at 2 days. Time slice 3 also shows a peak in periodicity at around 1 year which is 

equivalent to the duration of the overall waxing and waning in radiance in the corresponding time 

series (Fig. 4.7bi). A strong low period oscillation (i.e. 2.6 days) in the power spectrum occurs 

during a short sharp peak in MOD* values around July 2008. 

  The four major eruptive episodes at Kliuchevskoi dominate both the time series and the 

wavelet power spectrum (Fig. 4.7cii). The three symmetric events each show a waxing and 

waning of measured radiance with a periodicity of approximately 0.25 to 0.5 years (e.g., time 

slice 5 in Fig. 4.8). The maximum periodicity event (i.e. power = 1) for Kliuchevskoi is displayed 

in time slice 5 (i.e., period = 3.5 days;  centred on the 31
st
 May 2007). It occurred at the same 

time that a new lava flow was reported to have moved down the East flank of the volcano 

(BGVN 2007). Periodicity during the episode with more persistent Strombolian activity (i.e., 

time slice 6) displays more clearly separated peaks in period at 2.5, 16.5, 47 and 204 days. The 

fairly regular spacing (i.e., repose) of the last three eruptive episodes resulted in a 1.5 year 

periodicity centred around the turn of 2009.

4.7.  Discussion 

 

The MODIS and ASTER sensors provide datasets with their own particular advantages and 

disadvantages. MODIS channel 21 will very rarely saturate, even over hot volcanic targets, and 

can therefore be reliably used to provide a measure of volcanic thermal radiation if the target is 

hot and/or large enough. The daily revisit time of the MODIS sensor also allows dynamic 

volcanic events to be characterized in relatively high temporal detail. This sampling frequency 

could be improved further still, if necessary, by inclusion of data from the other MODIS sensor 

(i.e., on the Aqua satellite) as might be of critical importance during a volcanic crisis. The higher 

spatial resolution of the ASTER sensor, on the other hand, allows the spatial characteristics of 

thermal anomalies to be quantified more accurately and also facilitates the detection of subtle 

thermal anomalies. These capabilities permitted the identification of a thermal precursor to lava 

flows at Kliuchevskoi. Unfortunately the probability of ASTER capturing such precursors events 

is limited by the fact that it is not a mapping mission (i.e. does not acquire data continuously).  

 The low spatial resolution of MODIS leaves the sensor incapable of monitoring the type 

of thermal activity expressed by Láscar during the study period (i.e., predominantly fumarolic).  

There are plenty of other (potentially hazardous) volcanoes around the world that are similarly 

difficult for MODIS to monitor. Fortunately ASTER can provide a complimentary dataset that, 

when used in conjunction with MODIS datasets, has a better overall temporal, spatial and 

radiometric resolution. This can be used to obtain more information on a greater range of 

volcanic activity than either sensor could offer individually. 

 This is the first time to our knowledge that wavelet analysis has been applied over such a 

long (i.e., 11 year) data set of volcanic radiance. This enabled us to identify oscillations on 

weekly, monthly and yearly time scales. Very short period events (i.e., a few days) can be created 

by a burst of thermal activity such as from a short lived lava flow or lava fountain. It is possible, 

however, that similar oscillations in radiance - as seen from space - might also occur due to 

changes in cloud cover over a thermally stable target. Very short period events should therefore 

be interpreted with care and scenes should be inspected for cloud cover.  

 Long period events could be better resolved if the overall time series were more 

extensive. This reflects the need for continuous collections of data over multiple years and, 

eventually, decades. Fortunately the next generation of high temporal resolution polar-orbiting 



91 
 

satellites are coming through (i.e., Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP), 

Sentinel 3, and the Global Change Observation Mission climate change series (GCOM - C)). 

Wavelet analysis provides new constraints on the probability of the duration and repose of future 

events, and could be used as input into decision making tools such as the Bayesian event tree 

model for eruption forecasting, i.e., BET EF (Marzocchi et al., 2008). 

 

4.8. Conclusion 

 

This study investigated a collection of 11 year time series of MODIS and ASTER thermal 

anomalies (i.e., using the metrics MOD* and AST*, respectively) at four different volcanoes. 

MOD* measures the radiance emitted by a volcano and AST* measures the size of thermally 

anomalous areas.  This is the first time (to our knowledge) that two sensors of this type have been 

used to compare such long time series of the intensity and size of thermal anomalies. We show 

practical examples of the relative strengths of each sensor and how they can be used to improve 

overall understanding of volcanic activity at a number of distinctly different volcanoes.  

 The high temporal resolution MOD* metric was also analyzed using continuous wavelet 

transforms. Given the length of the time series it was possible to determine periods over which 

thermal activity waxes and wanes at a particular volcano as well as to characterize repose time 

between thermal events. This might be useful in guiding forecasts on the duration and onset of 

future eruptions. It also facilitates the comparison of the time scales over which different 

volcanoes erupt. The AST* metric allowed the size of thermal anomalies to be determined in 

relatively high detail, it also facilitate the detection of subtle thermal anomalies, both of these 

characteristics led to the identification of a thermal precursor to lava flow at Kliuchevskoi. It is 

useful, therefore, to explore synergies between high temporal and high spatial resolution datasets. 

 Time series plots, images and movies can be thought of as volcano monitoring products. 

These products could be made automatically and provided free of charge to volcano observatories 

and other interested parties. This would increase the science return from existing and future 

missions, raise the global profile of the space agency or corporation that provides the data and 

also contribute positively to society, especially to those at risk from volcanic hazards, be it either 

directly (e.g., local inhabitants) or indirectly (e.g., airplane passengers and international 

businesses).

Calculating Radiant Flux from Thermally Mixed Pixels

To be submitted to IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing 

 

 

5.1. Abstract 

 

Volcanic activity involves the transfer of hot material to the Earth's surface. This can be 

monitored on a global scale from space using infrared imagers on board satellites. However, 

surface temperature gradients at volcanoes, as well as other natural heat sources such as fires and 

geothermal fields, typically change significantly on the scale of a single pixel footprint (i.e. the 

area subtended by the instantaneous field of view of a single detector element). Consequently a 

pixel footprint will contain multiple thermal components over such heat sources. This paper 

explores the calculation of radiant flux from thermally mixed pixels through model fitting of 

spectral radiance. This is achieved using a new approach based on spectral libraries (i.e. a 

collection of the radiance spectra that might be measured over active terrestrial heat sources). 

Two spectral libraries were built. One for short-wave infrared (SWIR) imaging spectrometers, 

such as those that are currently in orbit or about to be launched (e.g. Hyperion, EnMap, Hisui), 



94 
 

and another for imaging spectrometers with SWIR, mid infrared (MIR) and thermal infrared 

(TIR) channels, representing data that might be collected from a future class of imaging 

spectrometers (e.g. HypsIRI). Spectral radiance can be modelled to within 3% for spectrometers 

with just SWIR channels and to within 5 % for those with SWIR, MIR and TIR channels. We 

suggest that this is within the accuracy to which spectral radiance can be reliably measured from 

space over hot volcanic targets. Radiant flux SWIR spectrometers can be measured to within 

20%; this is an improvement over existing methods. In contrast SWIR-MIR-TIR spectrometers 

ought to be able to measure radiant flux to within 1%. We infer that it might not be possible to 

reliably resolve the number, size and temperature of subpixel components from spectral 

information alone, and therefore suggest that radiant flux and radiant exitance are more reliable 

and accurate measures of thermal activity as seen from space. A practical example of our 

approach is demonstrated using Hyperion images of a lava flow from Kliuchevskoi volcano 

(Russia) in 2007. The upcoming generation of orbital spectrometers offers an opportunity to 

implement the proposed algorithms operationally. 

 

5.2. Introduction 

 

Volcanism is driven by heat transfer from the planet's interior to its surface. Satellites can 

monitor this fundamental driving force by measuring radiance from volcanic surfaces. Planck’s 

law describes the relationship between spectral radiance, temperature and wavelength which, 

when modified to account for spectral emissivity, can be expressed as follows: 

 

       (5.1) 

 

where  L( ,T)   is  spectral  radiance  (W m
-2

 sr
-1

 ?m
-1
)  as  a function  of wavelength  ( ) and  

temperature (T), ?  is spectral emissivity, and c1 and c2 are the radiation constants (i.e., c1 = 2hc
2
 

= 1.19?10
-16

 W m
2
 sr

-1
 and c2 = hc/k = 1.439?10

-2
 m K; where h is the Planck constant, c the speed 

of light and k the Boltzmann constant). To obtain a better understanding of conditions at the 

target surface it is often desirable to convert radiance into units that represent more tangible 

characteristics of the volcano, e.g., surface temperature distribution or radiated heat output in 

Watts. This facilitates monitoring of changes in thermal budgets over time and comparing 



95 
 

activity between different volcanoes (e.g. Glaze et al. 1989). Metrics of radiant heat output 

include radiant flux, ?, which is the rate of photon energy transfer (i.e. Watts), and radiant 

exitance, Q, which is a measure of radiant flux from a given surface (i.e. Watts per metre 

squared). The Stefan-Boltzmann law relates the radiant exitance from an isothermal surface to its 

temperature: 

 

          (5.2) 

 

where ? is emissivity, ? is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.67 10
-8

 W m
-2

 K
-4

 ), and T is 

temperature in Kelvin. The temperature of an isothermal surface can be obtained from spectral 

radiance by rearranging (5.1) appropriately. 

 

        (5.3) 

 

However, in a volcano monitoring context, it is usually not valid to assume that a surface will be 

isothermal at the pixel scale. Thus radiance that reaches a single detector element of a sensor is 

comprised of a mixture of contributions from a continuous temperature distribution that can, at 

some point, be discretised (i.e. be assumed to be composed of n isothermal components) for the 

purposes of modelling with negligible impact on the derived quantities. The radiant flux from an 

area can therefore be described as follows: 

 

         (5.4) 

 

where A is the size of a pixel footprint, whilst fn and Tn are the fractional area and temperature of 

the n
th

 subpixel thermal component. The aim of this work is to improve methods for calculating 

radiant flux for thermally mixed pixels. We also examine the feasibility of resolving the number, 

temperature and fractional area of individual subpixel components. These metrics are used in a 

range of disciplines including: volcanology, fire monitoring and geothermal exploration. 

 



96 
 

5.3. Existing methods for calculating radiant flux 

 

Hot volcanic features such as lava flows and fumaroles are often several hundreds of degrees 

hotter than the ambient background temperature, and display continuous temperature 

distributions, with thermal gradients reaching up to and beyond 500 
o
C m

-1
 (e.g. Oppenheimer et 

al. 1993b, Wright and Flynn 2003). The surface temperatures of such features can therefore 

change dramatically over the length scale of one metre. Yet high spatial resolution imagers with 

wavebands sensitive to volcanic heating (i.e. 2 - 12 ?m; 100 - 1200 
o
C) have pixel sizes on the 

order of 30 – 60 m. It is therefore likely that these active heat sources will be far from isothermal 

at the pixel scale. This is called the thermal mixing problem and a number of methodologies have 

been proposed to tackle it. 

 

5.3.1. Dozier Technique. 

 

The first published attempts to determine the temperature and size of subpixel thermal 

components were provided by Matson and Dozier (1981) and Dozier (1981). They assumed just 

two thermal components in a thermally mixed pixel. This allowed them to use a MIR and a TIR 

channel from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) to define and then 

solve for the following simultaneous equations: 

 

       (5.5) 

 

       (5.6) 

 

where L is spectral radiance, f is fractional area, x and y denote different wavebands and the 

subscripts hot and cold denote relative temperature. There are two equations and three unknowns 

(i.e. a fractional area and two temperatures). Solutions to these simultaneous equations require 

that one of the unknowns can be assumed a priori. This technique was developed for fire 

monitoring purposes but is extendable generally to any situation where thermally mixed pixels 

occur. It became known as the 'bi-spectral method' in the fire monitoring community and the 

'dual-band technique' within the volcano monitoring community after being adopted by Rothery 



97 
 

et al. (1988). Of course, with more distinct sensor channels, multicomponent models can be 

evaluated (e.g. Oppenheimer, 1993a). Once subpixel characteristics (i.e. number, temperature and 

size of subpixel components) have been obtained it is possible to calculate radiant flux using 

equation 5.4 (e.g. Glaze et al. 1989) 

 Although used extensively in different fields, the Dozier technique does not provide a 

reliable measure of the subpixel characteristics from natural heat sources. This is in part due to 

the sensitivity of simultaneous equation solutions to the required a priori assumption (e.g. 

Oppenheimer et al. 1993b). However, when more than two spectral channels are available it is 

possible to avoid making such assumptions (e.g. Flynn et al. 1993). The principal reason that the 

Dozier technique cannot be reliably used to obtain subpixel characteristics is that the continuous 

temperature distribution of volcanic thermal features is not well characterized by just two or three 

thermal components, be they fumaroles (e.g. Oppenheimer et al. 1993b) or lava flows (e.g. 

Wright &amp;amp; Flynn 2003). Furthermore there is a tacit assumption that all subpixel areas are 

radiating significantly (i.e. the sum of subpixel fractional areas is unity). This is not valid in the 

case that the method uses just SWIR wavelengths, as ambient background surfaces (i.e. &amp;lt;100
o
C) 

will not radiate significantly in this wavelength region. An analysis of the accuracy of the  Dozier 

technique revealed that, even if an active surface could be assumed to be composed of just two 

thermal components, the 'best possible' retrieval of temperatures and fractional areas were only to 

within ± 100 
o
C and 0.5 at one standard deviation (Giglio &amp;amp; Kendall 2001). Despite these 

shortcomings the methodology continues to be used to make semi-quantitative inferences about 

subpixel characteristics of thermally mixed pixels (e.g. Lombardo et al. 2006, Vaughan et al. 

2010, Blackett &amp;amp; Wooster 2011). 

 

5.3.2 Wooster Technique 

 

Wooster et al. (2003) developed a method for determining radiant flux from thermally mixed 

pixels using a single mid-infrared channel without the need to assume subpixel characteristics. It 

was based on the fact that the Planck function (equation 5.1) can be approximated using a power 

law within limited temperature and wavelength ranges. 

 

 



98 
 

          (5.7) 

 

where a and b are empirically derived constants. At a wavelength of around 4 ?m and 

temperature range of approximately 300 - 1200 
o
C the exponent, b, also has a value of around 4. 

Thus, under these wavelength and temperature conditions, equation 7 approximates the Stefan-

Boltzmann law (i.e. equation 2). This allows the following linear relationship between radiance 

and radiant flux to be derived. 

 

         (5.8) 

 

where c is a sensor specific empirically derived constant, L is the radiance measured from a 4 ?m 

channel and Lbkgd is the background radiance in that channel. Background radiance is typically 

estimated from neighbouring 'ambient' pixels. This allowed radiant flux from hot targets to be 

estimated to within ± 30% (Wooster et al. 2003). The approach was later adopted by the volcano 

monitoring community for monitoring radiant flux from all of the Earth's subaerially erupting 

volcanoes over a seven year period (Wright &amp;amp; Pilger 2008) and to create a twelve year time series 

of radiant flux from Stromboli volcano (Coppola et al. 2012). 

 

5.3.3. Model-fitting Approach 

 

Imaging spectrometers acquire a radiance spectra for each pixel location; these spectra  can be 

modelled as follows: 

 

        (5.9) 

 

where Ln( ) is the total spectral radiance from n subpixel thermal components at a given 

wavelength  , ?  is spectral emissivity, fi and Ti are the fractional area and temperature of the i
th

 

component, and L( ,T) is blackbody radiance at Ti. Emissivity spectra are assumed to be 

identical for all subpixel components within a given pixel footprint; which ought to be valid in 

the majority of volcano monitoring cases.  



99 
 

 It is therefore possible to obtain subpixel characteristics from hyperspectral images by 

model fitting. Oppenheimer et al. (1993c) achieved this using the simplex algorithm to resolve 

two thermal component solutions from hot volcanic surfaces imaged by the Airborne 

Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS). Wright and Flynn (2003) evaluated equation 

5.9 using a Levenberg-Marquardt gradient solver. This allowed the optimal number of subpixel 

solutions to be found automatically. They found that just two or three components were typically 

required to find a reliable flux estimate (i.e. one that did not change as the number of modelled 

thermal components increased). 

 

5.4. Reliability of Radiant Flux estimates 

 

Here we provide an explanation as to why radiant flux can be reliably obtained with simple 

thermal component models (i.e. just two or three components) even though such models do not 

reliably represent the number, temperature or fractional area of subpixel components. The 

integral of the Planck function (i.e. equation 1) with respect to wavelength is radiant exitance 

(equation 5.2). Radiant exitance is therefore equivalent to the region under the graph of spectral 

radiance. This is directly proportional to radiant flux by the factor of a surface area (i.e. in this 

case the area of a pixel). Therefore to calculate radiant flux all that is required is to be able to 

determine the region under a graph of spectral radiance and know the pixel size of the detector. 

The direct approach to solve the integral of spectral radiance would involve making a sufficiently 

continuous number of spectral measurements. Unfortunately this is not possible due to 

atmospheric absorption. Therefore it is necessary to fit a model to the parts of the spectrum that 

we can measure. It is not really relevant whether the subpixel characteristics used in a model are 

themselves accurate with regards to accurately calculating radiant flux. All that matters is that the 

area under the radiance spectrum is well characterized. This can be achieved by using a relatively 

simple thermal model. 

For any given model of a measured radiance spectrum the curve-fitting accuracy will 

always be lower than the area-fitting accuracy. That is, the proportional difference between the 

measured and the modelled curve will be higher than the proportional difference between the 

measured and modelled areas under those curves. Radiant flux estimates require good area-fitting 



100 
 

accuracy, conversely subpixel characterization requires good curve-fitting accuracy. Whether or 

not such a level of curve-fitting accuracy is practically obtainable is discussed later. 

 There is a multitude of ways of fitting a model to a data set. Using a gradient solver is one 

of them. Here we suggest an approach that is based on a spectral library. This offers notable 

advantages over the gradient solver approach: i) it will always converge towards (i.e. find) a 

solution, ii) it will always find the global minimum (i.e. the best solution that it is capable of 

finding) and iii) it is less computationally expensive (i.e. as solutions need only be called from 

memory), thus making them particularly well suited for calculations on board remote sensing 

platforms. 

 

5.5. A Spectral Library Approach 

 

A spectral library, in this piece of work, is defined as a collection of radiance spectra that 

represent the possible range that might be measured by an orbital imaging spectrometer when 

acquiring data over an active volcano. Spectral libraries can be used to fit models to measured 

radiance spectra by finding the best match in the library to the measured data. Two classes of 

spectral library were created. They correspond to the two classes of orbital imaging spectrometers 

considered in this study i) those which have only SWIR channels and ii) those with SWIR, MIR 

and TIR channels. The first represents the wavelength ranges of existing, or soon to be in orbit, 

imaging spectrometers such as Hyperion, EnMap and Hisui. The second represents a future class 

of sensors such as the HyspIRI mission, which is currently being considered for development by 

NASA (e.g. Hook &amp;amp; Oaida 2010). These two categories will be referred to as i) current-class and 

ii) future-class for the remainder of this article. The wavebands used to create each library are 

assumed to be well represented by a single central wavelength (Table 5.1). The wavebands of the 

current-class library correspond to Hyperion channels whilst those for the future-class of sensor 

are based on proposed HyspIRI channels (Hook &amp;amp; Oaida 2010). 

The current-class of sensors has a pixel size of 30 m. The future-class has a larger pixel 

size, i.e. 60 m, as has been proposed for the HyspIRI sensor in order to ensure high signal to 

noise ratios in the TIR bands. A three component thermal model was used to create the library 

spectra. The size of subpixel thermal components is measured in fractions of a pixel area. The 

fractional areas used to create the libraries range from 0.0025 to 0.95 for the current-class, and 



101 
 

0.00028 to 0.9992 for the future-class. The sum of subpixel components was not forced to be 

unity for the current-class library (i.e. because components lower than approximately 100 
o
C will 

not radiate significantly in the SWIR) but it was for the future-class library (i.e. because TIR 

wavelengths will be sensitive to the radiance emitted by non-active background surfaces). 

Increments in fractional area were not constant but instead were smallest at the lowest fractional 

areas and increased in size at larger fractional areas. This significantly reduced the size of each 

library and therefore increased the speed of library searches. The temperatures of thermal 

components used to make the library spectra ranged from  100 to 1110 
o
C for the current-class, 

and -30 to 1105 
o
C for the future-class. Cooler thermal components were included in the future-

class library because such surfaces will emit significant amounts of radiance at TIR wavelengths. 

There were 1.0 x 10
7
 spectra overall in the current-class library and 1.6 x 10

7
 in the future-class 

library.

5.6. Monte Carlo testing 

 

The number of possible spectra that an imaging spectrometer could measure is extremely large. It 

is therefore not possible to exhaustively test a methodology for calculating radiant flux against all 

possible spectra that could be measured in practice. We therefore test the ability of each spectral 

library at calculating radiant flux using a Monte Carlo approach. This involves executing a large 

number of random trials. We used 2, 3, 4 and 5 component thermal models to create Monte Carlo 

runs (i.e. random test spectra). One million such spectra were created for each thermal component 

model and for each library. We found the results to be stable at this number of runs (i.e. they 

were consistent even for different sets of random test spectra). Monte Carlo runs were created 

using the following constraints. Temperatures were allowed to float freely between 0 - 1100 
o
C 

although individual thermal components were forced to be at least  50 
o
C apart so that higher 

component models did not inadvertently become lower component models. Surfaces above 900 

o
C could occupy no more than 0.1of a pixel and those above 700 

o
C no more than 0.2, so as to 

reflect realistic temperature distributions over volcanic targets (Wright et al. 2011). Fractional 

areas could float freely between 0 and 1. The sum of fractional areas was forced to be unity for 

the future-class test spectra but not for the current-class. Finally Monte Carlo runs for the current-

class were forced to exhibit a radiance of at least 5 W m
-2

 sr
-1

 ?m
-1

 at a wavelength of 2.24 ?m in 

order to mimic the requirements of a simple anomalous pixel detection algorithm in the SWIR. 

The accuracy to which a library spectra were fit to a Monte Carlo run was measured using the 

mean absolute proportional difference (MAPD) between the two: 

 

         (5.10) 

 

where a is actual radiance (i.e. the Monte Carlo run) and o is optimal radiance (i.e. the best fitting 

library spectra) in the i
th

 channel of a spectrum which has n wavebands in total.

5.7. Hyperion data processing 

 

The Earth Observing 1 (EO-1) satellite forms part of the New Millennium Program. The 

Hyperion instrument on board EO-1 is the first ever orbital imaging spectrometer. It consists of 

VNIR and SWIR subsystems that together provide 242 channels, 196 of which are unique and 

calibrated. Spectral coverage ranges from 400 to 2500 nm at a resolution of 10 nm. The spatial 

resolution of each pixel is 30 m. The swath width of a scene is 7.7 km which translates into a 

nominal temporal resolution of 200 days. However, the spacecraft can be programmed to roll to 

various pointing angles allowing data to be acquired up to 5 times in a 16 day period. Automated 

acquisition requests of Hyperion data over volcanic targets can occur when activity (e.g. thermal, 

seismic, etc.) is detected by NASA's Volcano Sensor Web, which includes a collection of orbital 

and ground-based sensors (Davies et al. 2006). Radiometric quantization of Hyperion data is 12 

bits and an entire image is collected in around 30 seconds. Raw digital numbers (DN) are 

converted into radiance using the following scale factors. 

 

   
  

  
  (for Hyperion bands 1 - 70)       (5.11) 

 

   
  

  
  (for Hyperion bands 71-242)      (5.12) 

 

where L  is spectral radiance (in W m
2
 sr

-1
 ?m

-1
) and DN is the digital number in the relevant 

Hyperion channel.  

 The nine channels used to calculate radiant flux (Table 1) were selected to ensure 

sufficient coverage across the measured spectrum for accurate model fitting and to guarantee that 

at least a few unsaturated bands were available even over the hottest target surfaces.  Strong 

atmospheric water absorption features at 1400 and 1900 nm were avoided. When calculating 

radiant flux saturated pixel values were automatically avoided using the flag file in the level 1 

data product. All images in our dataset were acquired at night, it was therefore not necessary to 

correct for reflected solar radiation. The emissivity of the target surface was set to 0.95. The 

resulting radiance spectra were used to calculated radiant flux by finding the best match within 

the SWIR spectral library.

5.8. Results 

 

5.8.1. Monte Carlo Runs 

 

The spectral fit (i.e. MAPD) between Monte Carlo runs and the respective libraries are very 

good, i.e. to within 3% for the current sensor class library and 5% for the future sensor class 

library (Fig. 5.1). The figure shows a cumulative histogram of spectral fit for each thermal 

component model, i.e. 2,3,4 and 5 components, using red, green, blue and brown lines 

respectively. The spectral fits for the current class library are somewhat more accurate, i.e. tend 

to cumulate towards unity at lower MAPD values (Fig. 5.1). This is because they only have to fit 

the SWIR region of a spectrum whilst the future class library has to fit the SWIR, MIR and TIR 

regions collectively. However the spectral fit from both libraries is more accurate than the degree 

to which radiance can be reliably measured from space when imaging an active volcano (see 

discussion). Thus the accuracy of the following retrievals for radiant flux and subpixel 

characteristics can be considered to be at or beyond the practical detection limit of existing or 

near future orbital sensors.  

 

 

Figure 5.1. The spectral fit of Monte Carlo runs for libraries of a) current-class sensors and 

b) future-class sensors. These cumulative histograms are displayed using red, green, blue 

and brown lines for 2, 3, 4 and 5 component Monte Carlo runs, respectively. 

 

Figure 5.2a shows that the radiant flux from current class of sensors can be measured to within 

± 20 %. This is an improvement over the ± 30 % of the Wooster technique (Wooster et al. 2003). 

Conversely, radiant flux from future-class sensors can be measured to within ± 1 % (Fig. 5.2b). 



105 
 

The dramatic increase in accuracy of the future-class sensors is due to the extra spectral 

information they provide.  

 Notably both sensor systems show that a spectral library built using a 3-component 

thermal model is capable of measuring radiant flux for a range of subpixel characteristics (i.e. 

from 2 to 5 distinct thermal components) with similar degrees of accuracy (Fig. 5.2).  

 

 

Figure 5.2. Accuracy of radiant flux measurements. Cumulative histograms for the current-

class library are shown in red, green, blue and brown for 2, 3, 4 and 5 component Monte 

Carlo runs, respectively. The histograms for the future-class library fit within the black 

region. 

 

 The ability for the 3-component spectral libraries to accurately determine subpixel 

characteristics can be directly explored using the corresponding 3-component Monte Carlo runs. 

The accuracy of temperature retrievals for these three components, i.e. maximum, middle and 

minimum temperatures, are depicted using red, green and blue lines, respectively (Fig. 5.3). 

 



106 
 

 

Figure 5.3. The accuracy of subpixel temperatures characterization for a) the current-class 

library and b) the future-class library. These cumulative histograms display the deviation 

of model maximum (red), middle (green) and minimum (blue) temperatures from the 

actual value. 

 

 Maximum temperatures are relatively more accurate from the current sensor library (Fig. 

5.3a), i.e. they can be reliably constrained to within about 150 
o
C. Overall however thermal 

components are poorly constrained for both classes of sensor, with temperature estimates only 

reliably obtained to within 300 
o
C of the actual value for all thermal components. 

The accuracy to which fractional areas can be estimated is plotted in Figure 5.4. 

Maximum, middle and minimum areas are depicted using red, green and blue lines respectively. 

Minimum fractional area estimates are somewhat more accurate for the current class of sensors. 

Again, however, these subpixel characteristics are poorly constrained.  Fractional areas can only 

be reliably defined to within 40% of the pixel size for both sensor classes. 

 

 

Figure 5.4. The accuracy of subpixel fractional areas for a) the current-class library and b) 

the future-class library. These cumulative histograms display the deviation of model 

maximum (red), middle (green) and minimum (blue) fractional areas from the actual value. 



107 
 

 

 Thus unless spectral radiance can be measured and modelled to within an accuracy of 

greater than 3% for the current-class sensors and 5% for the future-class sensors, it is not possible 

to reliably measure subpixel characteristics accurately from spectral information alone. This has 

significant repercussions for any methodology that attempts to resolve subpixel characteristics 

from multispectral or hyperspectral imagery. We therefore suggest that radiant flux estimates are 

significantly more accurate and reliable measures of thermal volcanic activity and should be 

given preference over attempting to resolve subpixel characteristics. 

 

5.8.2. Radiant Flux from a Lava Flow at Kliuchevskoi, Russia 

 

Kliuchevskoi began an eruptive episode on the 15 February 2007 with the onset of Strombolian 

activity (BGVN 2007). Three Hyperion images were acquired during the ensuing episode on the 

18 April, 22 May and 13 June 2007. Radiant flux [W] and radiant exitance [W m
-2

] maps were 

calculated from these scenes using a spectral library approach. Also provided for each scene are: 

total radiant flux (?total) in megawatts [MW], average radiant exitance (i.e. Qmean) in watts per 

metre squared [W m
-2

], and the size of thermally anomalous areas (A) in thousands of metres 

squared [1000's m
2
]. 

 During this episode the volcano displayed a variety of eruptive products. including: 

Strombolian eruptions, lava flows on the NW and E flanks, fumarolic activity, mudflows, 

frequent gas-and-steam plumes as well as ash plumes (i.e. up to about 8 km in height and 

extending 2000 km from the volcano) and Vulcanian eruptions (Vencke 2002-). 

 The first scene (Fig. 5.5i) is coincident with Strombolian activity in the crater and 

increased fumarolic activity (BGVN 2007). It displays the maximum average radiant exitance 

within these scenes due to the hot, spatially limited output from fresh Strombolian activity. 

Thermal activity is still constrained to the active crater at this time. The second scene (Fig. 5.5ii) 

is concurrent with lava flow down the N flank of the volcano and shows the greatest overall 

radiant flux due to the relatively extensive and hot flow surface. Smaller flow fronts are visible 

and are orientated to the NNW and SE. This image was acquired during a phase of Vulcanian 

eruptions that occurred on the 11, 16 and 22-24 May. The final scene on the 13th June (Fig 5.5iii) 

shows the radiant flux from a different lava flow that began descending the SE flank of the 



108 
 

volcano on the 31 May (BGVN 2007), i.e. 2 weeks before the image was acquired. It shows the 

lowest average radiant exitance signifying that it was cooler than the previous flows at the time of 

acquisition. The axis of this flow is cooler than the margins. Strong phreatic bursts were seen 

from the front of the lava flow during interaction with glacial ice (BGVN 2007).

approximately up.

5.9. Discussion 

 

There are a number of reasons why measurements of radiance emitted from volcanoes are not 

perfectly accurate. They include: i) the point spread function of a detector element extending 

beyond the nominal pixel size of a sensor, ii) hysteresis in a sensor system along a scan line over 

hot target, iii) imperfect atmospheric corrections (especially in the presence of volcanic fumes 

and/or aerosols, as well as the difficulty in constraining reflected atmospheric irradiance in 

daytime scenes), iv) spectral emissivity corrections (i.e. which depend on composition and 

surface roughness, and therefore age of the target area, as well as wavelength and potentially 

temperature; furthermore emissivity might not always be homogenous at the subpixel scale), v) 

inaccuracies in the geolocation overlap between different wavebands, vi) the non-instantaneous 

amount of time over which radiance is collected, vi) sensor noise, and vii) the spectral width of 

individual channels. The majority of these issues apply in other applications where radiance 

emitted from a terrestrial target is measured from space (e.g. fire monitoring and geothermal 

exploration). 

Therefore, although in theory a more detailed spectral library could provide a better 

spectral fit and therefore flux estimate, in practice it would not. This is because the model fitting 

accuracy already equals or exceeds the accuracy to which volcanic, geothermal or fire-based 

radiance can be measured from space. The reason that accurate radiant flux estimates are 

relatively easy to obtain whilst accurate subpixel characteristics are not is because the two require 

very different amounts of model fitting accuracy. Relatively small spectral differences can signify 

a large change in temperature or fractional area of subpixel components; whereas the 

corresponding change in the area under the radiance spectra will remain small. 

 

5.10. Conclusion 

 

We have shown that it is possible to use spectral libraries to calculate radiant flux from space for 

efficient on-the-fly processing. This method is transferable to field based or airborne sensors. The 

ability to reliably resolve the temperature and area of subpixel components in thermally mixed 

pixels would require that spectral radiance be both measured and modelled to within 3 - 5% 

accuracy. Given the sources of error inherent in measurements of spectral radiance from volcanic, 



110 
 

and other natural thermally emitting targets (e.g. fires and geothermal area), it might not be 

possible to ever reliably resolve subpixel characteristics using spectral information alone. Even 

so, it is still possible to obtain reliable flux estimates, especially when sufficient spectral coverage 

(e.g. SWIR, MIR and TIR channels) is available.

Future Prospects and Conclusion 

 

 

 

The principal findings from each study presented in this thesis are outlined below. After which 

future satellite missions that could be used to monitor thermal volcanic activity from space are 

described. Finally the overall conclusions derived from this work are presented. 

 

 

6.1. Recapitulation 

 

Chapter 1 outlined the motivation behind this thesis, the overall objectives of the work, and the 

scope of what has been presented. Chapter 2 introduced the fundamental scientific principles of 

remote sensing from space using infrared wavelengths, described the past and present orbital 

imagers that can be used for this purpose and outlined the work of previous authors in the field. 

Issues concerning the state-of-the-art where also highlighted. 

 Chapter 3 explored the use of different metrics of thermal activity in ASTER scenes and 

how these metrics correlated to eruptive activity. This was carried out for two different volcanic 

targets, i.e. Erebus (Antarctica) and Láscar (Chile), using a decadal time series of images. The 

first metric, which was the most widely adopted by previous authors, measures the single hottest 

pixel temperature. It was shown that this metric produced considerable scatter at Erebus, even 

though radiant output from this volcano is known to be remarkably consistent. This was 

interpreted as being largely due to the difficulty this metric has at reliably describing small hot 



112 
 

features such as lava lakes. On the other hand this single hottest pixel metric was able to produce 

more meaningful insight at Láscar as thermal anomalies are more spatially extensive and 

typically exhibit lower thermal gradients. Even so, characterizing thermal activity using a single 

pixel value will inevitably lack spatial information. To be able to distinguish between, for 

example, large cool anomalies and small hot anomalies, a new metric of thermal activity was 

introduced that quantifies the size of low, moderate and high temperature anomalies. This metric 

was more robust against subpixel effects at Erebus and provided more profound insights into 

thermal activity at both volcanoes, allowing new thermal precursors to be identified at Láscar. 

 Thermal metrics using ASTER's TIR bands typically depend on the definition of a 

background temperature. It was shown that existing methods for selection of this parameter were 

sensitive to the slope and aspect of the volcanic edifice as well as the solar azimuth. A new 

method for calculating more robust background temperatures was therefore put forward. 

Anomalously hot TIR pixels were detected by statistically detecting an abnormal deviation above 

the background temperature. Thermal anomalies in ASTER SWIR bands were also identified. 

This aided in further constraining interpretations of eruptive activity. 

 Chapter 4 investigated the use of sensors with different temporal and spatial resolutions to 

synergistically characterize thermal volcanic activity. The MODIS and ASTER sensors were 

used for this purpose as both are situated on the Terra satellite and therefore provided multiple 

contemporary viewing opportunities. The data sets covered an 11 year time series at four 

distinctly different volcanoes: Erta ‘Ale (Ethiopia), K?lauea (Hawai'i), Láscar (Chile) and 

Kliuchevskoi  (Russia). MODIS was used to measure volcanic radiance and was able to 

characterize dynamic changes through time as well as to capture ephemeral events. ASTER 

constrained the size, shape, location and orientation of thermal anomalies and was able to detect 

relatively subtle thermal activity. This allowed the size and intensity of thermal anomalies to be 

compared for different styles of volcanism, i.e. lava lake, Hawaiian, Strombolian, Vulcanian and 

passive degassing. Wavelet analysis of volcanic radiance, as measured by MODIS, characterized 

the timescales over which individual episodes waxed and waned, as well as the repose between 

them. 

 Chapter 5 introduced a new method for calculating radiant flux from thermally mixed 

pixels. It was based on fitting a model to a measured radiance spectrum by finding the best match 

in a spectral library. The accuracy and reliability of this approach was tested using a large 



113 
 

collection of random, synthetic spectra (i.e. Monte Carlo runs). It was shown that model fitting 

accuracy was quite high (i.e. 3 - 5 %). The possibility of obtaining the size and temperature of 

subpixel components through model fitting was explored. It was found that neither size nor 

temperature could be reliably constrained, even given the model fitting accuracy. This suggests 

that it might not ever be possible to obtain subpixel characteristics from spectral information 

alone. This adds extra significance to metrics that can be obtained reliably, such as radiance, 

radiant flux and radiant exitance. 

 

6.2. Future of infrared sensors 

 

The future for infrared monitoring of volcanoes from space is an exciting one. National and 

multinational contributions will provide a greater supply of new, state-of-the-art satellite 

sensors. The next generation of state-funded  missions of use in measuring volcanic radiance 

from space are summarized in Table 6.1.

114 
 

6.2.1. High Spatial Resolution Missions 

 

The Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM), which will extend the heritage of the successful 

Landsat series of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), was launched 

successfully on 11th February 2013. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) are expected to 

take control of LDCM ~100 days after launch, at which point data will become available to all 

users at no cost. Sentinel 2, of the European Space Agency (ESA), will provide high spatial 

resolution datasets at remarkably high temporal resolution for its class (i.e. 5 days at the equator 

with up to 2 day repeat visit time when using the emergency pointing mode). The German 

Aerospace Centre (DLR) will launch the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program 

(EnMap) which shall provide an unprecedented number of spectral bands for civilian use and 

have ± 30
o 

pointing capabilities that will permit revisit times of up to 4 days. The third 

Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS - 3) of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency 

(JAXA) will contain the Hyperspectral Imager Suite (HISUI) sensor which is seen as a follow-

up to ASTER. It will contain a VNIR multispectral radiometer and a S W I R  hyperspectral 

radiometer. 

 NASA plans to launch the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) mission sometime 

after 2020. It is being designed with volcanic applications specifically in mind and, as such, 

has extremely promising specifications. It  is i ntended to  includ e hyperspectral VSW IR 

monitoring capabilities geolocated to multispectral MIR and TIR bands of equal pixel size. The 

temporal resolution of the hyperspectral imagery will be 19 days, whilst the multispectral bands 

will have a 5 day temporal resolution. Data will be collected continuously during day and 

night and will be transmitted via direct broadcast.  

 

6.2.2. High Temporal Resolution Missions 

 

ESA will launch Sentinel 3 in 2013. This mission shall include a Sea and Land Surface 

Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) which will emulate MODIS capabilities and provide imagery 

within 3 hours of acquisition. This minimal latency between radiance reaching the sensor 

and data delivery to the end-user is extremely important for real-time volcano monitoring. JAXA 

is in the process of executing the Global Change Observation Mission (GCOM) which 



115 
 

consists of two satellite series. The GCOM - C series are intended for monitoring climate change 

and could also prove useful for volcano monitoring given that each system will have a 250 m 

SWIR band, two 500 m TIR bands and 2 - 3 day visit period. 

 Geostationary satellite data is set to be taken to a new level with the launch of GOES - R 

(i.e. scheduled for 2015) which shall provide coverage of the Americas. The main Earth 

observation instrument on it will be the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI), which will provide 11 

more channels than previous GOES imagers, 7 of those being in MIR and TIR. It will offer a 

standard geostationary temporal resolution of 15 minutes for the full visible disc, 5 minutes over 

the continental USA and, remarkably, up to 30 seconds over regions of interest. Its spatial 

resolution in the IR bands will be two times higher (i.e. 2 km pixels) than previous imagers in this 

satellite series. 

 

6.2.3. Non-Governmental Satellite Sensors 

 

 Beyond government organizations space is increasingly opening up to new areas of 

society. The University of Hawaii at Manoa, for example, is currently building a low cost, power 

efficient thermal infrared imaging spectrometer, i.e. the Thermal Hyperspectral Imager (THI), 

which is designed for use on board a micro-satellite bus. This will be achieved by encasing 

commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products in a pressure vessel, an approach that could allow 

many other academic institutions to build their own satellite sensors. Private firms have been 

providing satellite imagery for decades of course but their cost is typically prohibitive for volcano 

monitoring purposes. However, it might be possible to convince some firms to acquire and share 

data of (at least a few) active volcanoes on a regular basis. This makes for an exciting prospect 

given the capabilities of some of the planned commercial satellites. For example, DigitalGlobe's 

WorldView-3 will provide multispectral imagery with 8 SWIR channels at a temporal resolution 

of 1 - 5 days and at a remarkably high spatial resolution of 3.7 m. 

 

6.2.4. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles 

 

Aerial data is set to become ever more accessible given the rise of accessible COTS unmanned 

aerial vehicles (UAVs). Advances in UAV technology may even make it possible to obtain 

continuous collection of low cost data, that is, similar to the role currently played out by satellite 



116 
 

imagers, but with ultrahigh resolution and less atmospheric effects. This would require automatic 

take off and landing capabilities and/or the ability to stay airborne for prolonged periods of time 

(i.e. weeks), if the high cost of consistent human interaction is to be avoided. The former could be 

achieved using rotor-blade powered vehicles (e.g. helicopters and quadrotors) the latter using 

atmospherically buoyant aircraft (e.g. blimps and balloons). Ideally UAVs would be stationed 

permanently at a target volcano for long time series data collection but their high mobility also 

makes them excellent for emergency response.  

 

6.2.5. User demand 

 

Remote sensing data is becoming an ever greater part of everyday life. Well established websites 

now provide free, user-friendly volcano monitoring products (e.g. those hosted by the University 

of Alaska Fairbanks, avo.images.alaska.edu, and the University of Hawaii at Manoa, 

modis.higp.hawaii.edu). As familiarity with such data products increases so will demand. 

Furthermore, given the increasing tendency for government organizations to provide satellite data 

at no cost to the end user, new approaches to volcano monitoring are likely to arise. For example, 

applications for mobile devices could provide data products (e.g. images, movies, time series, 

etc) directly to interested parties automatically. Increased interconnectedness through technology 

may stimulate further demand for research into automatic volcano monitoring systems and ever 

more intuitive and informative user-friendly products. 

 

6.3. Conclusions 

 

The overall conclusions of this thesis are given below. 

 

i) Satellites are well placed to observe thermal volcanic activity on a global basis. However, it is 

necessary to use multiple orbital sensors, which collectively cover all infrared wavelengths and 

various spatial and temporal scales, if the full range of observable volcanic thermal phenomena is 

to be monitored. This is because different spectral regions are better suited to imaging targets 

with different temperature distributions. Generally speaking, thermal infrared sensors are more 

sensitive to cooler targets, whilst mid infrared and shortwave infrared sensors are relatively 



117 
 

sensitive to hotter targets. Reliable quantitative data can only be acquired within the detection and 

saturation limits of a sensor, whether these limits are reached or not is in part dependent on 

spatial resolution. Beyond radiometric considerations, eruptive products themselves occur over 

extremely diverse spatial and temporal scales. Thus it is necessary to develop sensor synergies. 

 

ii) Reliable and meaningful metrics are required to quantify thermal activity. Thermal mixing at 

the subpixel scale might exclude the possibility of reliable temperature retrievals given that 

inverse modelling of radiance spectra require a measurement reliable beyond that which can be 

reliably obtained from volcanic targets. Furthermore, the subpixel models required to execute this 

process may themselves be overly simplified representations of true surface temperature 

distributions. Alternative measurements such as radiance, radiant flux and exitance, which can be 

obtained reliably from thermally heterogeneous targets, are therefore probably superior metrics 

for volcano monitoring purposes and other analogous activities (e.g. the monitoring of fires and 

geothermal areas). 

 

iii) Beyond measuring thermal emissions from an individual pixel it is constructive to think of 

thermal anomalies as groups of pixels with collective spatial characteristics. For example, 

quantifying the overall size of anomalous areas provides a metric that accounts for all thermally 

anomalous pixels, and was shown to facilitate comparisons with field reports. Advances in this 

direction could look to also quantify the shape, location and orientation of thermally active areas 

and to analyze these spatial characteristics through time. This could provide information that 

might help to diagnose the cause of such anomalies and the risks they may pose to people and 

property. 

 

iv) One of the key aims of volcanology is to forecast hazardous events. New thermal precursors 

to eruptive events were identified in this thesis using infrared imagery of volcanoes. It is likely 

that others exist. Their discovery would be greatly facilitated by providing such data in a user-

friendly format that is accessible to those who may not be remote sensing specialists. This would, 

for example, aid advanced time series analysis (e.g. wavelet transforms) to flourish; in turn this 

could be used to supplement other input data in mathematical forecasting tools (e.g. Bayesian 

Belief Networks).

Capítulo 6 

 

Perspectivas Futuras e Conclusões 

 

 

 

Uma recapitulação dos principais desenvolvimentos e conclusões específicas alcançadas nesta 

tese é fornecida abaixo. Adicionalmente, é fornecida uma descrição dos futuros satélites que 

poderão ser utilizados para o monitoramento da atividade termal de vulcões. Ao final do capítulo, 

serão tecidas conclusões gerais derivadas do trabalho como um todo. 

 

6.1. Recapitulação 

 

No Capítulo 1 foram apresentadas as motivações da pesquisa de doutorado, assim como o escopo 

e os objetivos gerais da tese. No Capítulo 2 foram abordados os princípios científicos 

fundamentais de sensoriamento remoto utilizando comprimentos de onda do infravermelho. 

Foram ainda descritos os principais sensores orbitais, desativados e em operação, utilizados para 

detecção de radiação eletromagnética infravermelha, incluindo sínteses sobre contribuições 

extraídas da literatura quanto à aplicação desses dados em estudos sobre vulcões.   

 No Capítulo 3 explorou-se o uso de diferentes métricas de atividade térmica em cenas 

ASTER e como essas métricas estão correlacionadas à atividade eruptiva. Este trabalho foi 

realizado para dois diferentes alvos vulcânicos, i.e. Erebus (Antártica) e Láscar (Chile), 



120 
 

utilizando uma série temporal de imagens adquiridas ao longo de uma década. A primeira 

métrica, amplamente adotada na literatura, mede a temperatura mais quente de um pixel 

individual. Quando aplicada ao Erebus, um vulcão conhecido por um padrão termal notavelmente 

consistente, esta métrica produziu uma dispersão considerável devido, em grande parte, à sua 

dificuldade em caracterizar pequenos corpos quentes, como lagos de lava. Por outro lado, essa 

métrica do pixel mais quente foi mais eficaz na caracterização da atividade no vulcão Láscar 

visto que, neste alvo, as anomalias térmicas são espacialmente mais extensas e apresentam 

menores gradientes térmicos. Mesmo assim, a caracterização da atividade termal utilizando-se 

um valor de pixel, inevitavelmente, ocasionará a falta de informação espacial. Para abordar esse 

assunto e ser capaz, por exemplo, de distinguir entre grandes anomalias relativamente frias e 

pequenas anomalias relativamente quentes, uma nova métrica de atividade térmica foi 

introduzida quantificando o tamanho de anomalias de áreas com temperatura baixa, moderada e 

alta. Esta métrica foi mais robusta contra efeitos de subpixel e forneceu informações mais 

consistentes sobre a atividade térmica em ambos os vulcões, permitindo que novos precursores 

térmicos fossem identificados no vulcão Láscar.    

Métricas térmicas que utilizam bandas TIR do sensor ASTER tipicamente dependem da 

definição de uma temperatura de background. No Capitulo 3 ficou demonstrado que os métodos 

existentes para a seleção dessa temperatura são sensíveis à inclinação e aspecto do edifício 

vulcânico, bem como ao azimute solar. Um novo método para calcular as temperaturas de 

background foi desenvolvido. Pixels com assinaturas anomalamente quentes nas imagens das 

bandas TIR do ASTER foram detectados por apresentarem um desvio, estatisticamente anormal, 

acima da temperatura de background. Anomalias térmicas nas imagens das bandas SWIR foram 

também identificadas, o que auxiliou numa melhor interpretação da atividade eruptiva. 

 No Capítulo 4 investigou-se a utilização de sensores com diferentes resoluções temporais 

e espaciais para sinergisticamente caracterizar a atividade vulcânica térmica. Os sensores MODIS 

e ASTER, ambos do satélite Terra, foram utilizados para este fim, fornecendo múltiplas 

aquisições contemporâneas. Os dados cobriram uma série temporal de 11 anos, considerando-se 

quatro vulcões distintos: Erta ‘Ale (Etiópia), K?lauea (Havaí), Láscar (Chile) e Kliuchevskoi 

(Rússia). Os dados do MODIS foram utilizados para medir a radiação vulcânica e caracterizar 

mudanças dinâmicas ao longo do tempo, bem como para capturar eventos efêmeros. Os dados do 

ASTER permitiram a delimitação do tamanho, forma, localização e orientação de anomalias 



121 
 

térmicas, incluindo a detecção de atividades térmicas relativamente sutis. Isso possibilitou a 

comparação do tamanho e intensidade de anomalias térmicas em diferentes estilos de vulcanismo, 

ou seja, em um lago de lava, em erupções do tipo havaiano e estromboliano, e em situações de 

desgaseificação passiva. A radiância emitida pelos vulcões e medida pelo sensor MODIS foi 

submetida a análise pelo método de wavelets, o que permitiu a caracterização dos períodos de 

tempo em que a atividade vulcânica cresceu e diminuiu em eventos individuais, assim como os 

períodos de quiescência vulcânica.  

 O capítulo 5 introduz uma nova metodologia para calcular fluxo radiante de pixels 

termalmente heterogênicos que foi baseado na modelagem de espectros de radiância através de 

uma biblioteca espectral. A precisão e confiabilidade desta abordagem foi analisada utilizando 

uma vasta coleção de espectros sintéticos (i.e. espectros Monte Carlo). Os modelos produzidos 

tiveram alta precisão (i.e. 3 - 5 %). Também foi estudada a possibilidade de obter o tamanho e 

temperatura dos componentes subpixel através de modelagem. Os resultados mostram que o 

tamanho e temperatura não poderiam ser confiavelmente determinados mesmo com nível de 

precisão obtido pela modelagem. Este resultado sugere que não é possível obter características 

subpixel somente através de informação espectral. 

 

6.2. Futuros Sensores Infravermelhos 

 

O futuro do monitoramento dos vulcões por sensores operando no infravermelho a bordo de 

plataformas orbitais é bastante animador. Contribuições uninacionais e multinacionais irão 

proporcionar um número cada vez maior de satélites com melhor configuração e desempenho em 

relação aos seus antecessores. Uma síntese da próxima geração de missões financiadas por órgãos 

governamentais de vários países é apresentada na Tabela 1. 

 

6.2.1. Missões de alta resolução espacial e espectral 

 

O Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM), que sucederá série Landsat do National Aeronautics 

and Space Administration (NASA), foi lançado no dia 11 de fevereiro de 2013. O United States 

Geological Survey (USGS) assumirá o controle do LDCM em cerca de 100 dias após a decolagem, 

a partir de quando os dados estarão disponíveis sem custo para todos os usuários. O satélite 



122 
 

Sentinel 2, com lançamento previsto para 2013 pela Agência Espacial Europeia (ESA), deve 

oferecer imagens de alta resolução espacial (10 a 60 m), com alta resolução temporal para a sua 

classe (i.e. 5 dias no equador em modo normal; e 2 dias utilizando o modo de emergência). O 

Centro Aeroespacial Alemão (DLR) deve lançar até 2015 o Environmental Mapping and Analysis 

Program (EnMap) - um sensor hiperespectral que fornecerá o maior número de bandas espectrais 

para uso civil futuro e com capacidade de apontamento de ± 30
o
, permitindo a revisita  de um 

alvo em até 4 dias. O terceiro Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS - 3) da Agência de 

Exploração Aeroespacial do Japão (JAXA) conterá o Hyperspectral Imager Suite (HISUI), um 

sensor visto como uma espécie de continuação do sensor ASTER, com um radiômetro 

multiespectral no VNIR e um radiômetro hiperespectral no SWIR. 

 

Tabela 1. Satélites futuros para monitoramento de vulcões na faixa espectral do infravermelho. 

  

 

 

A NASA planeja lançar o Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) em algum momento 

em torno de 2020. Este sensor está sendo concebido para múltiplas aplicações em Geociências, 

incluindo monitoramento de vulcões, e compreende especificações extremamente promissoras. 

Pretende-se incluir um imageador hiperespectral no VSWIR, o qual produzirá imagens co-

registráveis a outras produzidas por uma suíte de sensores multiespectrais no MIR e TIR, com o 

mesmo tamanho de pixel. A resolução temporal do imageador hiperespectral será de 19 dias 

enquanto do sensor multiespectral será de 5 dias. Os dados serão coletados continuamente 

durante o dia e noite. 

 



123 
 

6.2.2. Missões de alta resolução temporal 

 

A ESA lançará a plataforma Sentinel 3 em 2013. Esta missão deve incluir o Sea and Land 

Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR), que emulará as capacidades do MODIS, fornecendo 

imagens-produto em até 3 horas após a aquisição. Esta latência mínima entre a radiância 

atingindo o sensor e a entrega dos dados é extremamente importante para monitoramento de 

vulcões em tempo real.  

A JAXA está em processo de execução do Global Change Observation Mission 

(GCOM), que consiste de duas séries de satélites. Um deles, o GCOM - C, será destinado ao 

monitoramento de mudanças climáticas e também poderá ser útil ao monitoramento de vulcões, 

visto que cada sistema terá um banda no SWIR com pixels de 250 m e um período de visita de 2 a 

3 dias. 

 Dados de satélite geoestacionários também deverão ser alçados a um novo patamar com o 

lançamento do Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite - série R (GOES - R), previsto 

para 2015, que fornecerá cobertura das Américas. O instrumento principal de observação da Terra 

será a Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI), que oferecerá 11 canais a mais do que as missões GOES 

precedentes, 7 dos quais posicionados em comprimentos de onda do MIR e TIR. O ABI oferecerá 

uma resolução temporal padrão de 15 minutos para as Américas como um todo; 5 minutos sobre 

o Estados Unidos e até 30 segundos sobre regiões de interesse. Sua resolução espacial nas bandas 

do infravermelho será duas vezes mais alta (i.e. 2 km por pixel) do que sensores anteriores da 

série GOES. 

 

6.2.3. Sensores não-governamentais 

 

Além das missões de organizações governamentais previstas, a exploração espacial será cada vez 

mais aberta para iniciativas na área acadêmica e comercial. A Universidade do Havaí, em Manoa, 

por exemplo, está construindo um espectrômetro de baixo custo, com cobertura no infravermelho 

termal, denominado de Thermal Hyperspectral Imager (THI), o qual está sendo projetado para 

uso a bordo de um micro-satélite. Esse objetivo será alcançado utilizando-se peças e produtos 

comerciais (COTS) prontos e semi-prontos, os quais serão montados numa câmara de vácuo. 

Esse tipo de abordagem pode permitir que outras instituições acadêmicas construam seus 



124 
 

próprios sensores orbitais. Empresas privadas têm fornecido imagens de satélite por décadas, 

entretanto, o seu custo é normalmente proibitivo para fins de monitoramento de vulcões. 

Atualmente há esforços no sentido de convencer algumas empresas a adquirir e compartilhar 

dados de pelo menos alguns vulcões ativos de uma forma consistente. Este é uma possibilidade 

animadora por causa das capacidades dos satélites comerciais sendo desenvolvidos. Por exemplo, 

o WorldView-3 da DigitalGlobe fornecerá imagens multiespectrais com oito bandas no SWIR e 

uma resolução temporal de 1 a 5 dias, além de uma alta resolução espacial de 3,7 m. 

 

6.2.4. Veículos Aéreos Não Tripulados (VANTs) 

 

Dados aéreos estão prestes a se tornar cada vez mais acessíveis, dado o aumento de acessibilidade 

de veículos aéreos não tripulados (VANTs). Avanços na tecnologia VANT podem proporcionar 

dados adquiridos de forma contínua e de baixo custo, ou seja, semelhante aos satélites, mas com 

resolução espacial superior e efeitos atmosféricos minimizados. Em geral, a operação humana de 

novas technologias é de alto custo. Para minimizar esta dependência, os VANTs exigiriam 

decolagem e aterrissagem automáticas (a partir de helicópteros comuns e helicópteros 

quadrotores) e/ou a capacidade de permanecer no ar por períodos prolongados de tempo (i.e. 

semanas) (a partir de plataformas flutuantes na atmosfera). Idealmente, os VANTs seriam 

estacionados permanentemente em um vulcão para obter dados ao longo tempo, mas a sua alta 

mobilidade também os tornaria excelentes para responder a emergências. 

 

6.2.5. Demanda do usuário 

 

Dados de sensoriamento remoto estão se tornando uma parte cada vez maior da vida cotidiana. 

Sites bem estabelecidos já fornecem produtos de monitoramento de vulcões num formato simples 

e sem custos (por exemplo, aqueles hospedado pela Universidade de Alaska Fairbanks 

(avo.images.alaska.edu) e da Universidade do Havaí (modis.higp.hawaii.edu)). A familiaridade 

com estes produtos somente tende a aumentar e, por consequência, também a demanda. Além 

disso, dada a intenção crescente de organizações governamentais em fornecer dados de satélite 

sem custo ao usuário final, novas abordagens para monitoramento de vulcões provavelmente 

surgirão. Por exemplo, aplicativos para dispositivos móveis (ex. smart phones e tablets) 



125 
 

poderiam fornecer produtos (ex. imagens, filmes, séries de tempo, etc) direta e automaticamente 

aos interessados. O aumento da interconectividade também deve estimular ainda mais a demanda 

para a pesquisa em sistemas de monitoramento automático de vulcões, e para produtos cada vez 

mais intuitivos e informativos. 

 

6.3. Conclusões 

 

As conclusões desta tese são apresentadas a seguir. 

 

i) Para caracterizar a gama completa dos fenômenos exibidos pelos vulcões é necessário observa-

los em várias escalas espacias e temporiais e todos os comprimentos de onda do infravermelho. 

Esta necessidade surge do fato que produtos de erupções têm uma variação enorme em tamanho, 

aproxidamente entre 1 e 1.000.000 metros, e podem se manifestar em periodos de tempo que 

variam de minutos a meses. Ademais, a radiância emitida por tais produtos é fortemente 

dependente da temperatura dos mesmos. Para garantir que a atividade vulcânica seja imageada 

dentro dos limites de deteção e saturação de pelo menos um dos canais espectrais, é essencial 

observar tal atividade em vários comprimentos de onda no infravermelho. É por isso que o 

desenvolvimento de sinergias entre diversos sensores é crucial. 

 

ii) A heterogeneidade termal na escala de um pixel provavelmente exclui a possibilidade de 

calcular a temperatura de alvos vulcânicos com confiança pelos seguintes motivos: 1) medidas de 

radiância não podem ser obtidas com o grau suficiente de precisão e 2) os modelos que formam a 

base do cálculo da temperatura tendem a ser  simples demais e, portanto, não representam  a 

distribuição verdadeira da temperatura superficial. Medidas alternativas como radiância, fluxo 

radiante e excitância, que podem ser obtidas confiavelmente mesmo em superfícies termalmente 

heterogêneas, são portanto mais adequadas para o monitoramento de vulcões e outras atividades 

análogas (ex., monitoramento de incêndios e áreas geotermais). 

 

iii) Além de quantificar atividade termal em pixels individuais é útil tratar tal atividade como 

conjuntos de pixels com caraterísticas espaciais coletivas. Por exemplo, quantificar o tamanho de 

áreas termalmente ativas facilita comparações com atividade observada em campo. Novos 



126 
 

avanços neste assunto poderiam incluir a quantificação da forma, localização e orientação de 

áreas que são termalmente ativas e a análise das mudanças nestas características espaciais no 

tempo. Informações sobre o comportamento de atividade termal no espaço e no tempo podem 

ajudar a diagnosticar os processos vulcânicos por trás destas atividades e a interpretação dos 

riscos que elas trazem. 

 

iv) Um dos objetivos principais do estudo de vulcões é a previsão de erupções. Esta tese 

identificou novos precursores à atividade vulcânica utilizando imagens do infravermelho.É 

provável que outros precursores existam. A sua descoberta seria facilitada com o acesso de tais 

imagens em um formato amigável para quem não seja neccessário um especialista em 

sensoriamento remoto. O fornecimento de dados processados pode ser feito de forma 

automatizada com as metodologias desenvolvidas neste trabalho de doutorado. A distribuição 

gratuita de dados processados para qualquer pessoa interessada poderia ajudar em avanços, por 

exemplo, na análise de séries de tempo (ex. através wavelets) o que, por sua vez, permitiria 

contribuir na previsão de erupções.
