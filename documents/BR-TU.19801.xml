Abstract 

This thesis is a stratigraphic and structural analysis of the Itabaiana Dome Area in 

the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt, northeastern Brasil. The ESE-WNW 

trending Sergipano Fold Belt is a subgreenschist to amphibolite grade metavolcano-

sedimemary wedge polydeformed during the 700-600Ma Brasiliano-Pan-African 

orogeny. Crystalline basement gneiss domes mantled by metasediments are found 

within the fold belt which lies between the Sao Francisco Craton in the south and the 

Pernambuco-Alagoas Massif to the north. An area of 4000km2 surrounding the 

Itabaiana and Simao Dias gneiss domes was mapped at 1:50,000 scale. 

A new stratigraphy has been established for this part of the Sergipano Fold Belt. 

Two major Middle to Late Proterozoic sedimentary cycles have been recognised, each 

with a basal siliciclastic megasequence overlain by a carbonate megasequence. Four 

main stratigraphic groups have been established. The =330m thick Estancia Group 
consisting of metasandstones, pelites, and metacarbonates unconformably overlies the 

crystalline rocks of the craton and is laterally equivalent to the =200-1100m thick Miaba 

Group which consists of the Itabaiana quartzites; the Ribeiropolis phyllites, pebbly 

phyllites, diamictites and metavolcanics; and the Jacoca metacarbonates. The Miaba 

Group is unconformably deposited around the gneiss domes. The =700m thick Lagarto 

Group has been identified as a new lithotectonic element in the southern part of the 

Sergipano Fold Belt. This group is a coarsening-upward siliciclastic sequence that 

overlies the older rocks of both the craton and the fold belt. It consists of the Lagarto-

Palmares mud stones, silts tones, sandstones and lithic wackes together with the Jacare 

metasiltites and the Frei Paulo phyllites, metarhythmites, metagreywackes, minor 

metacarbonates and metavolcanics. The =200-2000m thick Vaza Barns Group, 

consisting of the Palestina diamictites and the Olhos D'água metacarbonates, 

unconformably overlies the older rocks to the north of the Itaporanga fault. 

The thickest Palestina diamictites occur in a WNW-ESE trending, fault-bounded 

depocentre which also received relatively deep water accumulations of the other 

formations. The siliciclastics generally thin towards the basement gneiss domes, 

whereas the carbonates thin away from the domes into the diamictite trough. The 

thickness and facies distributions of these units indicate tectonically controlled 

sedimentation, with basement highs supplying sediments from both the southern and 

northern margins of an asymmetric basin. 
The structure of the Itabaiana Dome Area is dominated by shallowly plunging, 

SSW vergent Fj and F2 recumbent to inclined folds and steep D2 thrust faults. D1 is 
characterised by WNW-ESE trending, SW vergent, nappe-like folds associated with a 
penetrative layer-parallel foliation. D2 is characterised by co-axial, up-right, tight and 
WNW-ESE trending folds, associated with penetrative axial surface foliations, lineations 
and high-angle, SSW vergent, oblique slip thrust faults. These regional thrust faults are 
probably inverted extensional faults. Late-stage, orogen-parallel movement generated 
transverse F3 kink-style folding and rotation of fault bounded domains. 

Regional lithostructural correlations between the southern and northern parts of 
the Sergipano Fold Belt indicate that the Sergipano Basin may be interpreted to have 

ii 



been a WNW-ESE striking half graben that deepened towards the ENE. It was infilled 
by miogeoclinal-eugeoclinal sediments and evolved axially into a small oceanic basin, 
termed the Caninde sea, in its northeastern part. The preferred tectonic model for the 
evolution of the Sergipano Basin is that of a linked system of listric extensional faults 
that merged into a basal detachment with a ramp-flat geometry. Inversion of this 
extensional fault system due to oblique collision of the Borborema Province to the north 
with the São Francisco Craton to the south, produced sinistral transpression of the 
sedimentary wedge of the Sergipano Basin and resulted in the Sergipano Fold Belt. 

The tectonic and stratigraphic evolution of the Sergipano Fold Belt is similar to 
that found in other Brasiliano and Pan-African mobile belts. In particular the correlation 
of stratigraphy from the craton into the fold belt, the interpretation of sedimentation 
controlled by extensional tectonics suggest a model of basin formation by extension of 
the craton margins, development of pericratonic and small ocean basins which were then 
deformed by collision of continental fragments against the craton margins. This model 
agrees with those postulated of a supercontinent that evolved by fragmentation and 
amalgamation along long-lived zones of lithosphere weakness throughout the 
Proterozoic.

Chapter 1 - Introduction and the area of study 

1.1 - Introduction 

This thesis is an analysis of the tectonic and strati graphic evolution of the southern 
part of the Sergipano Fold Belt, located in the Sergipe and Bahia States, northeastern 
Brazil. The Sergipano Fold Belt forms part of the Borborema Province, at its southern 
border with the Sao Francisco Craton (Fig. 1.1; Almeida et al. 1977). 

The polydeformed and poly metamorphosed Late Proterozoic Sergipano Fold Belt 
trends ESE-WNW and its tectonic evolution is ascribed to the 900-600Ma old Brasiliano 
orogeny (Brito Neves &amp;amp; Cordani 1973; Brito Neves et al. 1977a). The southern part of 
this belt consists of folded and thrust faulted low- to mid-green schist facies 
metasediments (quartzites, phyllites, diamictites and carbonates) overlying a 2100-
1800Ma old granite-gneiss basement. This basement crops out in two structural domes, 
the Itabaiana and Simão Dias domes, which are mantled by the metasediments. 

This thesis is principally concerned with the structural and stratigraphic 
relationships and Brasikano-age geological evolution of these cover and basement rocks. 

1.2 - Regional geology of the Sergipano Fold Belt 

The Borborema Province (Fig. 1.2) is a mosaic of Archean to Early Proterozoic 
granitic, gneissic and migmatitic terranes with several NE-SW, E-W and WNW-ESE 
striking mobile belts. The province was consolidated during the 900-600 Ma Brasiliano 
thermo-tectonic cycle, which was also characterised by intense granite emplacement 
(Brito Neves 1975; Santos &amp;amp; Brito Neves 1984). 

The structural grain of the Borborema Province is cross-cut by two E-W striking 
shear zones known as the Patos and Pernambuco lineaments. The age of these crastal-
scale lineaments is not fully determined, but the Patos Shear Zone has been associated 
with the 700-500Ma old Brasiliano tectonic evolution of the Serido Fold Belt (Corsini et 
al. 1991) and the Pernambuco Shear Zone has been associated with Brasiliano cycle 
reactivation of the Transamazonic-age Riacho do Pontal Fold Belt (Fig. 1.2; Gomes 
1990). 

The Pernambuco-Alagoas Massif lies to the south of the Pernambuco Shear 
Zone. The Sergipano Fold Belt lies further south, between this massif and the Sao 
Francisco Craton. 

The Sao Francisco Craton was fully consolidated by the end of the 2100-1800 
Ma old Transamazonian tectonic cycle and is the largest surface extent of Archean rocks 
in Brazil (Mascarenhas et al. 1984; Teixeira &amp;amp; Figueiredo 1991). It consists largely of 
upper amphibolite to granulite facies metamorphic terranes, subsequently affected by 
granite emplacement and large-scale fracturing during the Brasiliano event. The Sao 
Francisco Craton is surrounded by five fold belts which display a centreward 
convergence of tectonic transport direction (Fig. 1.2; Mascarenhas et al. 1984).

The triangular-shaped Sergipano Fold Belt is transected by several ESE-WNW 
trending thrust and strike-slip faults (Fig. 1.3). The belt is 200km wide along its 
boundary with the Sergipe-Alagoas Mesozoic Basin, and stretches for about 400km to 
its western extremity (Brito Neves et al. 1977 a). It is cross-cut by the N-S to SW-NE 
trending Tucano-Jatoba Mesozoic basin, and is limited to the north by the Pernambuco 
Shear Zone. 

The Sergipano Fold Belt is comprised of three main domains that define three 
major lithotectonic assemblages: the Estância, Miaba-Vaza Barris and Macurur£ Groups 
(from south to north in Fig. 1.3). These groups were interpreted by Silva Filho et al. 
(1978 a &amp;amp; b) as cratonic cover, and the fault-bounded miogeocline and eugeocline, 
respectively, whereas Santos et al. (1988) and Davison &amp;amp; Santos (1989) considered 
them to represent cratonic, supra, and mid- to infra-crustal structural levels. The Sao 
Miguel do Ateixo fault separates the southern and northern parts of the Sergipano Fold 
Belt (Davison &amp;amp; Santos 1989). 

The northern part of the belt corresponds to the Macurure Group and comprises 
polydeformed, greenschist to upper amphibolite facies siliciclastic and carbonate 
metasediments, migmatites, acid and basic volcanics, and basic-ultrabasic intrusive 
rocks, all intruded by a series of 850-600Ma syn- and post-tectonic granites. 

The southern part of the belt consists of the polydeformed, greenschist facies 
siliciclastic and carbonate metasediments of the Miaba and Vaza Barris Groups, and the 
almost undeformed and non-metamorphosed cratonic sediments situated to the south of 
the Itaporanga fault (Estancia Group). 

The crystalline basement occurs as inliers in both the southern and northern parts 
of the belt. The inliers in the southern part are the Itabaiana and Simao Dias domes 
(within the Itabaiana Dome Area, Fig. 1.3), and a gneissic structure which is enclosed in 
the western corner of the belt (Brito Neves &amp;amp; Cordani 1973; Brito Neves et al. 1977 a; 
Gava et al. 1983). 

The structure of the Sergipano Fold Belt is characterised by penetrative fold and 
foliation development, with associated WNW-ESE striking thrust and strike-slip faults. 
Metamorphism ranges from sub-greenschist to greenschist facies in the southern 
domain, and from greenschist to amphibolite facies in the northern part of the belt 
(Jardim de Sa" et al. 1981, 1986; Brito Neves et al. 1987a &amp;amp; b; Santos et al. 1988; 
Davison &amp;amp; Santos 1989). 

The Sergipano Fold Belt has been mapped at 1:250,000 scale (Gava et al. 1983). 
In addition, its central area has been mapped at 1:100,000 scale (see the Carira Project, 
Fig. 1.4 A), and part of Itabaiana Dome Area has been mapped at 1:40,000 scale 
(Humphrey &amp;amp; Allard 1967, 1969). 

The detailed sedimentary, stratigraphic and structural relationships, and the 
tectonic evolution of the Sergipano Fold Belt are poorly understood. These problems are 
addressed in this thesis.

1.3 - Aims of this thesis 

This thesis details die results of research based on geological mapping in the area 

oudined in Figure 1.4, which covers approximately 4000km2. 

The aims of this research programme were: 

1 - To undertake a detailed analysis of the sedimentological and stratigraphic 
evolution of the Itabaiana Dome Area (Fig. 1.3). 

2 - To undertake a detailed analysis of mesoscopic and microscopic structures, 
and to determine the tectonic evolution of the area. 

3 - To present an analysis of the stratigraphic and structural evolution of the entire 
southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt, by combining die data collected in the field area 
with data obtained from the literature, 

4 - To develop a model for the tectonic evolution of the southern part of the 
Sergipano Fold Belt, from basin formation and sediment deposition to its subsequent 
closure and incorporation in the Sergipano Fold Belt during the Brasiliano orogeny 

1.4 - Methodology 

This research programme involved both detailed and regional geological 
mapping, together with stratigraphic and structural analysis. Thin section petrographic 
analysis of selected samples and integration of the geophysical data from the study area 
were also carried out. 

Field work 

A total of 180 days were spent in the field during 1987, 1988, and 1990. 
Approximately 1200 outcrops were studied in detail. The outcrops were located on 
1:100,000 scale topographic maps (IBGE - Brazilian Institute for Geography and 
Statistics) enlarged to 1:50,000 scale. 

A detailed study was made of the large Capitao farm outcrop, at the junction of 
the Salgado and Vaza Barris rivers (Fig. 1.4). This outcrop was mapped at 1:100 scale. 

About eighty aerial photographs (SACS, Brazil, 1971, 1:70,000 scale) were 
studied in detail, to determine the continuity of the units within the area, the nature of 
contacts, the trends of foliations and other structures. The results were also incorporated 
in the geological map of the Itabaiana Dome Area. 

Laboratory work 

3,200 structural measurements were made in the Field, including the orientation 
of bedding, foliations, lineations and fold axes. About 140 rock samples were cut into 
220 thin sections, which form the basis of detailed petrographic, sedimentary and 
structural studies. The majority of the thin sections were oriented for structural analysis. 
The length of about 1890 axes of clasts from diamictites and pebbly phyllites were 
determined; 750 measured directly from outcrops, and 1140 measured from 38 oriented 
thin sections.

Geophysical work 
The geophysical data used in this study includes gravity, magnetic and 

scintillometer data. These data were collected by the Companhia de Pesquisas e Recursos 
Minerals (CPRM, Salvador-Bahia, Brazil) and were compiled by the geophysicist Dr. 
A.C. Motta, of the same company. Geophysical maps and sections were produced and 
the data integrated with cross-sections. Topographic data used for gravity interpretations 
were collected by Mr. Marcio Afonso Lima de Brito, from the Caraiba Mineracao 
company (CM, Salvador-Bahia, Brazil). 

1.5 - Previous research 
The geological knowledge of the Sergipano Fold Belt is based upon work done 

by the universities of UFBa, UFRN, UFPe, USP, as well as federal and state 
companies such Petrobras, CPRM, EDRN, CODISE, CBPM, and Caraiba Mineracao). 
The comprehensive and systematic geological mapping of the belt was completed in 
1977 (Brito Neves et al. 1977a). 

Humphrey &amp;amp; Allard (1962, 1967, 1969) described the main lithostratigraphic 
units and established the basic elements of the geology of the area. They postulated that 
the area evolved as an intracratonic basin in accordance with the geosyncline theory of 
Auboin (1965). Previous geological studies concerned primarily with regional geology 
(summarised by Brito Neves et al. 1977a). 

Santos &amp;amp; Silva Filho (1975), Silva Filho et al. (1978 a &amp;amp; b), Silva Filho &amp;amp; Brito 
Neves (1979), and Silva Filho (1982) established the basic stratigraphy of the area, and 
divided the Sergipano Fold Belt into the cratonic, miogeocline and eugeocline 
components. 

Jardim de Sá &amp;amp; Calheiros (1981), Jardim de Sa et al. (1981, 1986) gathered 
much data on the metamorphic and structural evolution.They disputed previous 
geological models involving B-subduction zones and proposed an alternative model 
involving the collision of two cratonic blocks. A similar interpretation has been adopted 
by Brito Neves et al. (1977 b), Brito Neves et al. (1987) and Campos &amp;amp; Brito Neves 
(1987). 

Davison (1987), Santos et al. (1988) and Davison &amp;amp; Santos (1989) also studied 
the area and interpreted the Sergipano Fold Belt as a collage of possibly exotic terranes 
produced by an oblique collision event. 

The geochronology of the belt is based on scattered Rb-Sr and K-Ar 
determinations (Hurley 1966; Brito Neves &amp;amp; Coidani 1973; Brito Neves et al. 1977c; 
Gava et al. 1983; Santos et al. 1988). Geophysical data from the Sergipano Fold Belt 
were presented and interpreted by Rand et al. (1980), Santos et al. (1988), and Motta 
(1990). 

The geology and geochemistry of the basic-ultrabasic Caninde' Complex, in the 
northern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt (Silva Filho 1976), has been subject of 
increasing interest and diverging interpretations in the recent years (Blais et al. 1989; 
Oliveira &amp;amp; Tarney 1990; Bezerra et al. 1990).

The metallogenic potential of the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt has 
been a subject of interest for companies such as Caraiba Mineração and Companhia 
Baiana de Pesquisas Minerais (Moraes et at. 1987; Conceição Filho &amp;amp; Sales 1988; 
Guimarães et al. 1991). Jardim de Sá (1986) analysed the economic geology of the 
whole Sergipano Fold Belt, and Santos et al. (1988) presented a 1:100,000 scale 
provisional metallogenic map of the Carira project area, based on geochemical, 
sedimentological, structural and geophysical data. 

1.6 - Structure of this thesis 

This thesis consists of seven chapters: 

Chapter 1 introduces the Sergipano Fold Belt and the research area. 

Chapter 2 reviews the geology of the Sergipano Fold Belt, and places the 
thesis study area in its tectonic context. 

Chapter 3 describes the geology of the research area and focuses on the 
stratigraphic record. A new stratigraphy for the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt 
is presented. 

Chapter 4 describes the structural and metamorphic evolution of the mapped 
area and relates this to the evolution of the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt. 

C h a p t e r 5 presents an analysis of geophysical data from the southern part of 
the Sergipano Fold Belt, and integrates this with the geological data. 

Chapter 6 describes the geological evolution of the research area, and develops 
a model for the tectonic and stratigraphic evolution of the southern part of the Sergipano 
Fold Belt. This is integrated with the geology of the northern part of the Sergipano Fold 
Belt, and implications for the evolution of other Proterozoic fold belts are discussed. 

Chapter 7 presents the conclusions of this research and recommendations for 
future research.

2.2 - Introduction 

2.2.1 - Regional setting 

The Sergipano Fold Belt (Fig. 2.1) lies between the granulites and the 
amphibolite-grade gneisses of the northern part of the Sao Francisco Craton to the south, 
and the Pernambuco-Alagoas Massif to the north (Mascarenhas et al. 1984; Santos &amp;amp; 
Brito Neves 1984). 

The Borborema Province consists of SW-NE trending Archean to Early 
Proterozoic granite-gneiss migmatitic regions (originally named massif by Brito Neves 
1975). The massifs have been reworked by the 900-600 Ma Brasiliano thermo tectonic 
events responsible for the ultimate evolution of the mobile zones (Santos &amp;amp; Brito Neves 
1984; Brito Neves 1986). Some of the mobile belts, however, also show evidence of an 
early evolution starting in the 2100-1800Ma Transamazonic cycle (Jardim de Sa et al. 
1988; Jardim de Sá 1988). 

The northern part of the Sao Francisco Craton (Fig. 2.1) is comprised of 
Archean to Early Proterozoic high-grade gneisses and Early Proterozoic mobile belts, 
which include high-grade metamorphic rocks, low-grade supra-crustals rocks and 
granite-greenstone sequences (Inda &amp;amp; Barbosa 1982). 

2.2.2 - The Sergipano Fold Belt 
Humphrey &amp;amp; Allard (1962,1967,1968,1969), Allard &amp;amp; Hurst (1969), and Allard 

(1969) first described the Sergipano Fold Belt, at that time named the Propria 
geosyncline (Fig. 2.2). 

It consisted of a horst of Late Proterozoic, WNW-ESE trending, metavolcanic-
sedimentary rocks separated from the Tucano and Sergipe-AIagoas Mesozoic basins, by 
the Tobias Barreto and Propria normal faults. These authors also described the basic 
lithostratigraphy, based on detailed studies carried out mainly around the Itabaiana dome. 

Humphrey &amp;amp; Allard (1967,1969) characterised five main structural elements 
within the Sergipano Fold Belt (Fig. 2.2):

1- The crystalline basement cropping out mainly in the Itabaiana and Simão Dias 
domes. 

2- The metavolcano-sedimentary wedge comprising two laterally-equivalent 
groups (the miogeoclinal Miaba Group, unconformably deposited around the basement 
domes, and the eugeoclinal Vaza Barris Group). 

3- The Glória batholhh: a suite of granodioritic to quartz-monzonitic plutons 
surrounded by biotite-garnet hornfelses derived from the Vaza Barris Group. 

4- Thrusts and small- to large-scale, overturned, nappe-like folds, both indicating 
a southward tectonic transport. 

5- The Estância Formation (siliciclastic and carbonate sediments), unconformably 
deposited in the craton. 

Barbosa (1970) studied the Sergipano Fold Belt to the west of the Tucano basin, 
and described a Precambrian to Ordovician lithostratigraphy consisting of the Macururé, 
Canudos and Bambui Groups (shown together in Fig. 2.2). The Macururé Group 
(paragneisses, micaschists and quartzites) is unconformably overlain by the Canudos 
Group (phyllites, metacarbonates and carbonaceous schists), which is in turn 
unconformably overlain by the Bambui Group (metacarbonates). 

However, Jordan (1971) showed that the Bambui and Canudos Groups are 
laterally equivalent, and proposed that the Macururé group consists of two parts, one 
underlying and the other overlying these two equivalent groups. 

The &gt;900Ma old Bambui sediments (Misi 1976) form an extensive blanket of 
carbonate and siliciclastic sediments that covers large part of the surface of the São 
Francisco Craton (see heavy dotted pattern, Fig. 2.1). These sediments form a Late 
Proterozoic platformal sequence which has been partially deformed during the Brasiliano 
orogeny (Mascarenhas et al. 1984; Inda &amp;amp; Barbosa 1982; Teixeira &amp;amp; Figueiredo 1991) 

Humphrey &amp;amp; Allard (1967, 1969) also mapped part of the belt situated to the 
west of the Tucano basin, analysed data from oil wells, and demonstrated the continuity 
of the metasediments underneath the Tucano and Sergipe-Alagoas Mesozoic basins, and 
correlated the metasediments to the east and west of the Tucano basin (Fig. 2.2). 

Allard (1969) and Allard &amp;amp; Hurst (1969) carried out geological mapping in part 
of the western side of Gabon, in Africa, and correlated the Vaza Barris group, defined in 
the horst of the Sergipano Fold Belt, with the Nadjolé schists in the African continent. 

After three decades of regional and detailed studies, the geological map (Fig. 2.3) 
of the Sergipano Fold Belt shows a substantially improved geology consisting of a much 
more complex distribution of lithologies dominated by an array of regional faults starting 
in the western apex of the belt (the Macururé, Canudos and Bendengó faults) and 
extending to the east of the Tucano-Jatobá basins (the Itaporanga, São Miguel do Aleixo, 
Belo Monte-Jeremoabo, and Jacaré dos Homens faults). 

Apart from the Bendengó and Canudos faults (names adopted here), all the fault 
names have been taken from Gava et al. (1983), Santos et al. (1988) and Davison &amp;amp; 
Santos (1989). 

Santos &amp;amp; Silva Filho (1975), Silva Filho et al.(1978 a &amp;amp; b), Silva Filho &amp;amp; Brito 

Neves (1979), and Silva Filho (1982), defined the basic stratigraphy of the belt (see 

12 



13 



legend of Fig. 2.3), consisting of the laterally continuous, Estância Group, the 
miogeoclinal Miaba and Vaza Barris Groups, and the eugeoclinal Macururé Group 
(including slices of basement rocks, and the mafic-ultramafic, volcanic and intrusive 
Canindé Complex of Silva Filho 1976). 

These authors also defined two younger formations: the Palmares sandstones 
overlying the cratonic Estância Group, and the Juá conglomerates and sandstones which 
infill a small graben within the Macururé Group. 

Following their regional synthesis, the Estância, Miaba and Vaza Barris Groups 
have been considered equivalent to the Bambui Group (Misi 1976; Silva Filho et al. 
1978 a &amp;amp; b), a correlation widely accepted in the literature, at least between the cratonic 
Estância and Bambui Groups (Inda &amp;amp; Barbosa 1982; Gava et al. 1983; Mascarenhas et 
al. 1984; Teixeira &amp;amp; Figueiredo 1991). 

Many other authors argued for the lateral continuity within the cratonic, 
miogeocline and eugeocline domains, and adopted models of a tectonic evolution mainly 
based upon a frontal collision between the Pernambuco-Alagoas Massif and the São 
Francisco Craton (Rand et al. 1980; Jardim de Sá et al. 1981; Jardim de Sá et al. 1986; 
Campos Neto &amp;amp; Brito Neves 1987). 

Davison (1987) proposed a model of transpressional and oblique collision, and 
with more detailed studies by Santos et al. (1988), which resulted in the mapping of 
areas of high grade gneisses and acid-intermediary metavolcanics within the northern 
domain (Fig. 2.3), Davison &amp;amp; Santos (1989) proposed to divide the Sergipano Fold Belt 
into the northern and southern parts, separated by the São Miguel do Aleixo fault, and 
that the belt could be the result of the collage of possible allochthonous, fault-bounded 
domains (possibly terranes). 

The tectonic evolution of the whole Sergipano Fold Belt is attributed to a 
Brasiliano ( 600Ma old) collisional event between the Pernambuco-Alagoas Massif and 
the São Francisco Craton (Davison &amp;amp; Santos 1989). 

2.3 - Litho-stratigraphic units of the northern part of the Sergipano Fold 
Belt 

The northern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt is comprised of the Macururé, 
Canindé, Poço Redondo and Marancó Domains (Santos et al. 1988; Davison &amp;amp; Santos 
1989). 

The Macururé Domain contains metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks of the 
Macucuré Group, and also the sediments of the Juá Formation and intrusive granites. 

The Canindé and the Marancó Domains contain rocks of mid- to infra-crustal 
affinities, and correspond to the Canindé and Marancó Complexes (Fig. 2.3). 

The Canindé Domain lies to the north of the Canindé village and is cut by the São 
Francisco river. The Marancó Domain lies to the south of the Poço Redondo village, and 
is bounded to the south by the Belo Monte-Jeremoabo fault (Fig. 2.3).

map of the Sergipano Fold 
Belt. Section lines AA', BB', 
CC', DEFG and HH' correspond

Figure 2.6. (Based on several 
authors, as in the LEGEND). 



The Poço Redondo Domain occupies the faulted bounded area between the 
Caníndé and Poço Redondo villages and the border with the Tucano basin (Fig. 2.3). 

The Macucuré G r o u p is comprised of the Santa Cruz and the Traipu-
Jaramataia formations. The Santa Crux Formation consists of white micaceous 
quartzites (Leite 1969) that surround a basement dome in the northern part of the belt 
(Fig. 2.3) and are conformably overlain by the Traipu-Jaramataia Formation. 

The T r a i p u - J a r a m a t a i a F o r m a t i o n consists of mica schists, 
metagreywackes, phyllites, lenses of quartzites and marbles, especially in the western 
side of the northern part of the belt (Silva Filho et al. 1978a; Silva Filho &amp;amp; Brito Neves 
1979). 

Intercalations of calc-silicatic rocks, amphibolites and basic metavolcanics are 
described to the northeastern end of the belt (Jardim de Sá et al. 1981), whereas in the 
central area, Santos et al. (1988) identified phyllites, metasiltites, metagreywackes, 
mylonitic quartzites, mylonitic chlorite-quartz, biotite-garnet and staurolite-garnet 
schists, metadacites and porphyry metadacites. 

The J u á Formation consists of conglomerates, greywackes, and arkoses with 
clasts derived from rocks situated to the north of the Juá graben (Santos et al, 1988). 

The C a n i n d é Complex (Silva Filho 1976) consists of gabbros, basalts, 
ultrabasic schists, felsic lavas intercalated with lenses of the Santa Cruz quartzites, and 
also with Traipu-Jaramataia marbles, meta-arkoses and graphite phyllites. 

The Marancó Domain (metarhyolitic and metadacitic lavas, interleaved with 
two sub-concordant serpentinised ulrramafic bodies and minor metasediments of the 
Macururé Group). The Canindé and Marancó Domains are intruded by syn and post-
tectonic granites. 

The Poço Redondo Domain consists of migmatitic gneisses intruded by syn 
and post-tectonic granites. 

The Granites form a calc-alkaline series of late- to post-tectonic intrusions 
relative to the F2 folding phase (Santos et al. 1988). They consist of granodiorites, 
diorite-monzonites and granites (Humphrey &amp;amp; Allard 1967, 1969; Silva Filho et al. 
1978a; Gava et al. 1983; Giuliani &amp;amp; Santos 1988; Fujimori 1989). 

The geochemistry of the rare earth and major elements of the main plutons (e.g. 
those surrounding the Carira town, Fig. 2.3) suggests that the magmas are co-genetic, 
and were intruded at depths of 9 -10 km (Giuliani &amp;amp; Santos 1988; Santos et al. 1988) 
under pressures around 5 kbar (Fujimori 1989). 

Giuliani &amp;amp; Santos (1988) discussed the origin of these granites, and interpreted 
the magmas as probably originated from the partial melt of the upper mantle (eclogites) 
with strong contribution of the lower continental crust (granulites). 

Fujimori (1989) argue that the granodiorites of the Sergipano Fold Belt have a 
mantle origin and geochemical signature of volcanic arcs, whereas the alkaline granites 
probably represent the syn-collisional stage. 

Other Brasiliano-age granitic bodies intruded in the Pernambuco-Alagoas Massif 
(Brito Neves et al. 1977 a &amp;amp; b) have a syenitic to quartz-monzonitic composition and 
commonly contain xenoliths of basic rocks (Gava et al. 1983; Jardim de Sá et al. 1986).

2.4 - Stratigraphy of the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt 
The southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt (Fig, 2.4) is comprised of the 

cratonic Domain, where the Estância Group is deposited, and the supra-crustal Domain, 
where the Miaba and Vaza Barris Groups are deposited. 

2.4.1 - The Estância Group 
The Estância Group in the region to the south of Itabaiana (Silva Filho et al. 197S 

b; Silva Filho 1982) consists of a 1km-thick sequence of continental to shallow marine 
siliciclastic and carbonates, divided into the Jueté, Acauã and Lagarto Formations. This 
is unconformably overlain by the Palmares sandstones. 

In an area 100 km to the south of Itabaiana, Saes (1984) documented in detail a 
gradual passage between the Lagarto and Palmares formations and described a 3km-
thick Estância Group (Fig. 2.5 A). 

The Jueté Formation consists of laminated sandstones, with conglomeratic 
lenses of basement derived clasts, and brown to red argillites. The top is marked by red-
brown to purple, fine to medium grained feldspathic sandstones with clasts of red 
argillites. 

The Acauã Formation is conformably deposited on the Jueté Formation, and 
unconformably overlies the basement gneisses. It is comprised of basal limestones and 
dolomites, calcitic argillites with lenses of limestones, overlain by limestones and 
dolomites with thin intercalations of fine grained, cross bedded, red sandstones and 
green argillites. 

The Lagarto Formation generally conformably overlies the Acauã Formation, 
the basal contact is locally erosive with the Acauã carbonates, or it is even in fault contact 
with the crystalline basement. 

This formation consists of conglomeratic basal sandstones with intercalations of 
red argillites and siltites, passing upward to green and brown siltites and to calcite 
cemented, fine sandstones and wackes with small- to meso-scale tabular cross 
stratification. 

The Palmares Formation is typically green, mostly medium grained, well-
cemented arkosic sandstones with intercalations of locally pebbly lithic greywackes, 
which have fragments of quartz, feldspars, quartzites and phyllites. 

The contact with the Lagarto sandstones is generally gradual, although a breccia 
with fragments of carbonates, and lenses of polimictic conglomerates are found locally 
along this contact. 

2.4.2 - The Miaba Group 
The Miaba Group (Fig. 2.5 B) is comprised of the Itabaiana, Jacarecica, and 

Jacoca Formations. The Miaba Group is probably as thick as 1 km (Humphrey &amp;amp; Allard 
1969; Silva Filho et al. 1978 a &amp;amp; b; Davison &amp;amp; Santos 1989) 

The Itabaiana Formation (200-600m thick) unconformably overlies the 
crystalline basement, and consists of arkosic basal quartzites (locally conglomeratic) 
passing upward to quartzites with small- to meso-scale cross bedding.

19 



The Jacarecica Formation (0-150m thick) unconformably overlies the 
Itabaiana Formation, and consists of grey to reddish, locally conglomeratic 
metagreywackes, white to grey metaargillites, and reddish phyllites. Some pyroclastics 
rocks may also occur in this formation. The clasts in the conglomeratic bodies are from 
basement rocks and from the Itabaiana quartzites. In the northeastern border of the 
Itabaiana dome, Humphrey &amp;amp; Allard (1969) clasts of gneiss of up to 120cm in size. 

The Jacoca Formation ( 200m thick, Humphrey &amp;amp; Allard 1967, 1969) 
conformably overlies the Jacarecica Formation and unconformably overlies the Itabaiana 
Formation, specially around the eastern and western Itabaiana dome. It consists of 
marbles, metadolomites, metacherts, metaargillites, limestones, marls, dark grey 
phyllites and calcitic quartz-chlorite schists. The basal part of the column locally contains 
syn-sedimentary copper sulphide occurrences. 

2.4.3 - The Vaza Barris Group 
The Vaza Barris Group is comprised of the Capitão-Palestina, Olhos D'água and 

Frei Paulo-Ribeirópolis Formations. Generally the thicknesses are highly variable, and 
are barely estimated because of the deformation. However, it is normally accepted that 
this group could be as thick as 3km, on the eastern side of the itabaiana dome (Davison 
&amp;amp; Santos 1989). 

The Capitão-Palestina Formation unconformably overlies either the 
Jacarecica or Jacoca Formations, and in places the crystalline basement. It shows marked 
variations in thickness, and comprises two lithofacies: grey to green phyllites with lenses 
of metacarbonates, impure metarenites, local metabasalts and pyroclastic rocks (the 
Capitão facies) and a second lithofacies of diamictites containing granules to boulders of 
basement rocks, quartzites, quartz veins, carbonates and phyllites, with intercalated 
lenses of quartzites (the Palestina facies). 

The Olhos D'agua Formation is a sequence of dark grey to black, 
metalimestones, metadolomites, and intercalated variegated argillites. The carbonates are 
commonly parallel laminated, cross bedded and probably indicate a shallow marine 
depositional environment. Stratifera Undata stromatolites were described by Cassedane 
&amp;amp; Silva Filho (1982), close to the Saco da Camisa locality (Fig. 2.4). 

The Frei Paulo-Ribeirópolis Formation merges the original Frei Paulo and 
Ribeirópolis formations of Humphrey &amp;amp; Allard (1967, 1969) into two lithofacies. 

The Frei Paulo lithofacies consists of well-foliated metasiltites and sandy 
metasiltites passing to silty phyllites. The Ribeirópolis lithofacies consists of locally 
conglomeratic metagreywackes, meta-argillites, phyllites, metavolcanics, and lenses of 
metarenites and metacarbonates. 

The Frei Paulo lithofacies was described as having a gradual transition from the 
Lagarto sandstones, close to the southern margin of the Itabaiana dome (Silva Filho et al. 
1978 a &amp;amp; b; Silva Filho 1982), whereas in the northern part of the area (Fig. 2.4) they 
were described as having a gradual transition from the Olhos D'água carbonates (Santos 
et al. 1988).

Despite the lateral continuity of the major formations for 350km along the WNW-
ESE strike, stratigraphic analysis by Gava et al. (1983), Moraes et ai. (1987) and 
Conceição Filho &amp;amp; Sales (1988) have shown that the sedimentary units are reduced in 
thickness, or in some cases even absent in the Sergipano Fold Belt to the west of the 
Tucano basin. 

In the cratonic area to the west of the Tucano basin, the Jueté Formation is almost 
absent, and consists of local conglomeratic bodies. The Acauã Formation is generally 
continuous, but the Lagarto and Palmares Formations are absent. 

In the western miogeocline the Miaba Group cannot be mapped on a regional 
scale, although Humphrey &amp;amp; Allard (1969) described thin Itabaiana quartzites and lacoca 
rnetacarbonates. The Vaza Barris Group is represented only by the Frei Paulo-
Ribeirópolís and Capitão-Palestina Formations. 

2.5 - Structures and metamorphism 

2.5.1 - Introduction 
The Sergipano Fold Belt records a polyphase history of ductile to brittle-ductile 

deformations (D1- D3), with involvement of the crystalline basement. 
The deformation history is summarised in terms of two major co-axial folding 

phases ( F r F 2 ) associated with metamorphism (M1 and M2) together with generally 
southward thrusting. F2 folds are associated with the regional thrust faults, which 
generally have a late-stage E-W strike-slip movement. A minor, non-metamorphic, 
transversal folding event is associated with the late-stage strike-slip movement along the 
regional faults (Jardim de Sá et al. 1981, Jardim de Sá et al. 1986, Davison &amp;amp; Santos 
1989). 

The two main folding events are locally followed by a third phase of co-axial, 
open, non penetrative and non-metamorphic folding (Campos Neto &amp;amp; Brito Neves 
1987). 

Dj structures are a layer-parallel foliation (S 1), and local, isoclinal to recumbent, 
generally rootless, and south verging F1 folds. These are co-axially refolded by the F2 
folds which are WNW-ESE trending, subhorizontal to gentle plunging, open to tight, 
commonly upright to overturned folds. There is generally a NNE dipping axial planar 
foliation (S2) associated with these folds. 

Dj and D2 structures are locally (particularly in the northern part of the Sergipano 
Fold Belt) and co-axially refolded by kink-style or cylindrical, generally open, up-right 
F3 folds. There is generally a spaced cleavage axial planar foliation (S3) associated with 
these folds. 

The F2 folds and the regional faults are the main mappable structures. The strike-
slip movement is dextral along the faults to the west of the Tucano-Jatobá basin, and 
sinistral in those faults to the east (Fig. 2.3; Jardim de Sá et al. 1986; Moraes et al. 1987; 
Davison &amp;amp; Santos 1989). 

21 



2.5.2 - Structural and metamorphic partitioning 
In the cratonic (Estância) Domain, the sediments are mostly undeformed and 

unmetamorphosed, whereas the intensity of deformation increases toward the Bendengó-
Ttaporanga fault (Fig. 2.6 A &amp;amp; E). Jardim de Sá et al. (1986) described important F1 
folds associated with low-angle, southward thrusts and amphibolite facies 
metamorphism, 20km southward onto the São Francisco Craton, in the Patamuté area, to 
the west of the Tucano basin (Fig. 2.3). 

In the Vaza Barris Domain, limited by the Bendengó-Itaporanga and the 
Canudos-São Miguel do Aleixo faults, F2 and S2 are the main observed structures. S2 is 
either a spaced cleavage, or a slaty cleavage, or a quartz-sericite or chlorite-biotite 
foliation, or a pressure solution foliation, dipping at intermediate to high angles to NNE 
(Figs. 2.6 A &amp;amp; E). 

Although F1 folds have been identified, or inferred from structural relationships 
by Jardim de Sá et al. (1986) and Santos et ai (1988), Davison &amp;amp; Santos (1989) argued 
for a monophase deformation consisting generally of upright folds and thrusts in the 
southern Vaza Barris Domain (Figs. 2.6 B &amp;amp; C). 

Jardim de Sá et al. (1981) reports that from the cratonic to the Vaza Barris 
Domain, the metamorphism generally shows a gradual northward increase under sub-

greenchist to greenschist conditions, probably reaching temperatures of 300° to 400°C, 
and pressures of 1-3 kbar, and that on the basis of mineral paragenesis of seriate, 
chlorite and biotite in the metasediments, it has not been possible to distinguish the 
metamorphism associated with F1 and F2 folding events. 

A sharp metamorphic contrast is described across the central part of the São 
Miguel do Aleixo fault (Santos et al. 1988), but the passage is more gradual elsewhere 
between the southern and northern parts of the belt (Jardim de Sá et al. 1986; Campos 
Neto &amp;amp; Brito Neves 1987), 

Within the northern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt, the bedding (So), the S1 and 
S2 foliations (generally defined by the preferred orientation of biotite, garnet, quartz and 
minor staurolite and kyanite) are generally shallow-angle dipping (Figs. 2.6 a &amp;amp; B,C &amp;amp; 
E), and are affected by gentle to open F3 folds (Brito Neves et al. 1987; Campos Neto &amp;amp; 
Brito Neves 1987), but approaching the Belo Monte-Jeremoabo fault all the planar 
features turn to near vertical or dip at high angles to NNE (Fig. 2.6 C). 

The metamorphic evolution of the northern part of the belt is much more complex 
than the southern part, and is generally described in terms of amphibolite facies, 
although greenschist facies mineral paragenesis dominate in the northern boundary (Brito 
Neves et al. 1987; Santos et al. 1988). 

Jardim de Sá et al. (1981) described a greenschist to high-amphibolite facies 
metamorphism, which probably reached silimanite and anatexis isograds, but probably 
in a low pressure regime (M1) in the northern end of the belt. M 1 was superimposed by 
a new recrystallisation event under greenschist to amphibolite facies, with kyanite or 
andalusite present, indicating M2 metamorphism of probably higher pressures than M1 

Particularly in the area surrounding the Carira town (Fig. 2.3) the M1 
metamorphism reaches a peak of high greenschist to amphibolite facies of intermediate 

2 2

lines AA', BB, CC, DEFG and HH' are shown in Figure 2.3. See text. 

23 



pressures, whereas to the far east and northeast of Carira, the S l foliation is marked by 
muscovite and/or biotite, or by sericite/chlorite, reflecting greenschist facies metamorphic 
conditions (Jardim de Sá et ai. 1981; Santos et al. 1988). 

At the northeastern end of the Sergipano Fold Belt, M 1 varies from the prehnite-
pumpellyite up to the high amphibolite metamorphic facies, and M2 is somewhat weaker, 
though the presence of kyanite probably records a slight increasing of pressures (Jardim 
de Sá et al. 1981). 

In this region (Figs. 2.6 D &amp;amp; E), S0, S1 and S2 are flat lying and sub-parallel, 
and are co-axially refolded by open to tight, up-right to overturned, northward verging 
folds and high-angle thrusts involving the Macururé Group and the crystalline basement. 
The folds, whose axial planar foliation is marked by greenschist facies mineral 
assemblages, have been interpreted either as F3 folds (Brito Neves et al. 1987; Campos 
Neto &amp;amp; Brito Neves 1987) or as back-folds due to back-thrusting developed during 
progressive D2 deformation (Jardim de Sá et al. 1986). 

2.6 - Geochronology 

2.6.1 - Age of sedimentation 
Although the exact age of the sedimentation in the Sergipano Fold Belt remains 

unknown, the sediments are generally considered to be as old as Late to Middle 
Proterozoic. 

Two swarms of basic dikes cut the northern margins of the São Francisco 
Craton. In the western part of the craton, the dikes are 2000Ma old and are 
unconformably overlain by the Estância Group (Jardim de Sá et al. 1986). In the 
southern pan of the craton, the dikes are 1300Ma old (Cordani 1973) and have been 
interpreted as evidence of a phase of extension of the basement that may have been 
responsible for the development of the basin (Silva Filho et al, 1978 a). 

A Late Proterozoic age of sedimentation is the most feasible interpretation for the 
metasediments in the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt, because of the &gt;900Ma 
age for the Bambui Group (section 2.2.2). A similar argument has been applied to the 
Macururé Group, on the basis of syn-sedimentary tectonic processes (Jardim de Sá et al. 
1986). 

2.6.2 - Age of deformation and metamorphism 
It is generally accepted that the Sergipano Fold Belt resulted from tectono-

metamorphic events that range from 900 to 600 Ma. The peak of metamorphism is dated 
between 673-600Ma (Brito Neves &amp;amp; Cordani 1973; Gava et al. 1983) on the basis of 
several Rb-Sr and K-Ar ages. 

Brito Neves et al. (1977 c) presented a 23-point, 501-479 Ma range of Rb-Sr 
ages (average 490Ma) obtained from clay minerals of the cratonic Lagarto sediments, 
and interpreted the data as indicative of the anchimetamorphism affecting the Estância 
Group. 

24 



Santos et al. (1988) and Davison &amp;amp; Santos (1989) however presented a 861-
805Ma range of Rb-Sr ages (average 838Ma) for late to post-tectonic granites in the 
vicinities of the town of Coronel João Sá (Fig. 2.3), and argue that the Macururé Group 
(or the northern part of the belt) may be older than the southern part, 

2.7 - Geophysics of the Sergipano Fold Belt 
Rand et al. (I980) made the first compilation of the gravity and magnetic data 

then available for the area of the Sergipano Fold Belt (Fig. 2.7 A) and produced an 
interpretation that the belt consisted of a continental crust formed by blocks of different 
densities, with no evidence of any crustal thickening, including a rootless Canindé 
Complex (Fig. 2.7 B). 

Santos et al. (1988) added detailed gravimetric and magnetometric data collected 
in the area of the Carira Project, and reinterpreted all data along the AA' section line (Fig. 
2.7 A). They modelled the upper crust of the northern part of the belt in terms of fault-
bounded blocks with an intermediate composition northward of the São Miguel do 
Aleixo fault and concluded that 1: the main regional faults are probably deep-rooted 
structures, and 2: the Sergipano Fold Belt thickens from 3 to 13 km, in the northern end 
of the section (Fig. 2.8). 

2.8 - Tectonic evolution 
The models for the tectonic evolution of the Sergipano Fold Belt are currently 

strongly debated in the geological literature of the area. 
Silva Filho et al. (1978 a) first introduced plate tectonic concepts for 

understanding the tectonic evolution of the Sergipano Fold Belt. They postulated a 
doubly vergent subduction process involving two passive margin-type basins. This 
model was challenged by Rand et al. (1980) and Jardim de Sá et al. (1981). 

Silva Filho &amp;amp; Brito Neves (1979) turned to a model which is an important 
attempt at describing the evolution of the Sergipano Fold Belt by also considering the 
sedimentary record. They postulated sedimentation in a single passive margin (Fig. 2.9) 
closed by the collision of the Pernambuco-Alagoas Massif and the São Francisco Craton. 

They described the tectonic evolution in four stages: the onset, the taphrogenic, 
the geosynclinal, and the orogenic stages. Their model is as follows: 

1. The onset stage recorded the initial extension of the crust, erosion of the 
basement highs and deposition of the Itabaiana and Santa Cruz quartzites in grabens 
(Fig. 2.9). 

2. The taphrogenic stage involved the continued extension of the crust, the 
erosion of the rejuvenated relief (the Jacarecica conglomerates and pebbly phyllites). The 
subsequent thermal relaxation produced subsidence and the first marine incursion (the 
Jacoca carbonates). The phase of maximum extension is recorded by the Capitão-
Palestina diamictites and associated volcanism.

3. The geosynclinal stage corresponded to the final extension of the basin, 
thermal relaxation and gradual sinking of the crust, and deposition of the third 
sedimentary cycle, in different environments: the Estância Group on the platformal or 
pericratonic area, the Vaza Barris Group and the top of the Macururé Group in the deeper 
part of the basin (Fig, 2.9). 

4. In the orogenic stage, the closure of the basin resulted in folding, uplift and 
erosion of the internal zones and supplied siliciclastics for the deposition of the Palmares 
and Juá Formations, respectively in foreland and in tramontane basins. 

Subsequent to the above model, although different hypotheses have been 
produced to explain the closure of the basin, the basic stratigraphy of the southern part of 
the Sergipano Fold Belt and its tectonic implications have not been questioned. In 
particular, the origin of the Palmares sandstones has not been challenged. In these 
models the basement domes have been treated as simple tectonic slices. 

These conceptual models are illustrated in Figure 2.10. The currently most 
accepted model involves collision between the São Francisco and the Pernambuco-
Alagoas blocks, probably in an intracratonic setting (Fig, 2.10 C-E). 

Jardim de Sá et ai. (1986) argued for a low-angle simple shear-thrust regime 
(Fig. 2.10 C) where the thrust stacking would explain the crustal thickening to the 
north, and back-thrusting would explain the northward vergence in the northern par of 
the belt. The strike-slip movement along the main faults is the ultimate evidence of the 
progressive shortening and locking-up of the regional folds. 

Brito Neves et ai. (I987) and Campos Neto &amp;amp; Brito Neves (1987) described 
evidence of nappe structures in the whole belt and attempted to relate these structures to 
deep-rooted crustal faults (Fig. 2.10 D). 

In contrast to the above models, Davison &amp;amp; Santos (1989) emphasises the rote of 
possible large-scale sinistral strike-slip movements along the high-angle thrusts (Fig. 
2.10 E) to juxtapose entirely different structural domains. 

2.9 - Plate Tectonic setting of the Sergipano Fold Belt 
The Sergipano Fold Belt is considered part of the Pan-African-Brasiliano fold 

system, which in Brazil and Africa consists of a frame of cratons and fold belts (Fig. 
2.11 A; Brito Neves 1975; Torquato &amp;amp; Cordani 1981; Porada 1989). As it is surrounded 
by six other cratons and five fold belts (Fig. 2.11 B) the São Francisco Craton appears 
to play a special role in the evolution of the entire system (Couto 1984). 

The regional and wider importance of the Sergipano Fold Belt was first 
highlighted when Allard (1969), and Allard &amp;amp; Hurst (1969) pointed out the extreme 
similarity between the Vaza Barris Group and the Nadjolé schists of Gabon, Africa, 
which are part of the 1300km-long West Congolian fold belt (Coward 1981 a; 
Schermerhorn 1981). Subsequently, different correlations of the Sergipano Fold Belt 
have been proposed for its African counterparts (Cordani 1973; Torquato 1974; Torquato 
&amp;amp; Cordani 1981; Jardim de Sá et al. 1981; Trompette 1982).

Davison &amp;amp; Santos (1989) discussed several possible correlations, and concluded 
that the Sergipano Fold Belt is probably part of a much longer E-W orogen stretching 
along the northern border of the São Francisco and West Congo Cratons in their pre 
South Atlantic configuration (Fig. 2.11 B) and attributed a key role to the Sergipano 
Fold Belt for die understanding of the Brasiliano orogeny. 

2,10 - Discussion 

Figure 2.12 is a cartoon to represent the main geological features and the two 
principal models for the tectonic evolution of the Sergipano Fold Belt. The model in 
Figure 2.12 A involves a single basin closed by a frontal collision, leading to the 
evolution of a classic fold-and-thrust belt, whereas the model in Figure 2.12 B argues 
for an oblique collision between the Pernambuco-Alagoas Massif and the São Francisco 
Craton, with the juxtaposition of different domains due to large-scale strike-slip 
movements along the regional faults. 

The first model does not consider the existence of the basement domes cored by 
metasediments near the foreland. The second model, although being increasingly applied 
in the current literature of fold belts and collision zones (as in Ho Ids worth &amp;amp; Strachan 
1991), does not take into account the difference in the sense of the strike-slip movements 
along the regional faults on both sides of the Tucano-Jatobá basin. 

Apart from the detailed description of the lithofacies in the Estância Group (Saes 
1984; Moraes et ai. 1987; Conceição Filho &amp;amp; Sales 1988) and from lithofacies analysis 
in the Vaza Barris Group, in the very southern part of the Carira Project, an area 
comparatively poor in outcrops and with numerous fault contacts (Santos et al. 1988), 
no comprehensive and detailed study has been carried out around the Itabaiana and 
Simão Dias domes since the research of Humphrey &amp;amp; Allard (1967, 1968, 1969). 

From their pioneer research, several indications of a possible tectonically 
controlled sedimentation were given, particularly about the origin of the diamictites and 
about the uplift of the Itabaiana dome. These indications have been renewed in a general 
approach by Silva Filho et al. (1978 a &amp;amp; b) and Silva Filho (1982), but have never been 
looked in detail by other researchers working in the area subsequently. 

This overview obviously points to the Itabaiana Dome Area as a key if any 
reasonable contribution is to be made in the geology of the southern Sergipano Fold 
Belt, towards a better understanding of the entire belt and towards the understanding of 
the Late Proterozoic craton-belt system of Brazil and Africa. 

In fact, among the belts which surround the São Francisco Craton, the 
Sergipano Fold Belt uniquely has crystalline basement domes mantled by a relatively 
preserved low to medium grade metamorphic sequence. The Itabaiana Dome Area, 
contains sedimentary and structural relationships best preserved than anywhere else in 
the Sergipano Fold Belt, and is suitable for the detailed study of the basement-cover 
relationships. These relationships are considered the key in the understanding the 
tectonic evolution of Proterozoic fold belts by Naha &amp;amp; Mohanty (1989), who studied the 
Aravalli Group in India.

Figure 2.12 - Cartoons to illustrate the two main hypotheses for the tectonic 
evolution of the Sergipano Fold Belt. (A): A continuous basin with laterally 
equivalent lithologies now imbricated by major SSW verging thrust faults 
associated with minor strike-slip movement. (B): Basins with different lithological, 
tectono-metamorphic and magmatic characteristics, juxtaposed along major

2.11 - Conclusions 
1 - The Sergipano Fold Belt resulted from the evolution of a Middle-Late 

Proterozoic possibly intracratonic basin closed during the 900-600Ma Pan-African-
Brasiliano orogeny. The geology of the Sergipano Fold Belt can be summarised as in 
Figure 2,12. 

2 - The stratigraphy of the belt (Fig. 2.12 A) is comprised of the cratonic 
Estância Group, the miogeoclinal Miaba and Vaza Barris Groups, and the eugeoclinal 
Macururé Group. These are separated by ESE-WNW trending, regional thrust and 
strike-slip faults. The Archean-Early Proterozoic crystalline basement crops out in the 
Jirau do Ponciano mantled dome, in the northern part of the belt, and in the Itabaiana and 
Simão Dias mantled domes, in the southern part of the belt. The first age of 
sedimentation in the southern part of the belt is more likely to have been around 1000-
900Ma. 

3 - The structural evolution is generally described in terms of Fj-F2 folding 
phases associated with thrusting and greenschist up to amphibolite facies ( 650Ma old) 
metamorphism. The main mappable structures are ESE-WNW trending, moderately 
inclined to up-right, south-southwestern verging, open to tight and gentle plunging F2 
folds, which co-axially refold recumbent F1 folds and/or an intense S1 foliation. The F2 
folds developed a pervasive, pressure solution-type axial planar foliation (S2), and is 
associated with the ESE-WNW trending regional faults. F 1 -F 2 structures are co-axially 
refolded by local, kink-style or cylindrical, open to tight, up-right to overturned F3 folds 
which have a spaced cleavage axial planar foliation. Other minor structures (transversal, 
open to tight, upright, kink-style folds, kink bands and crenulations), are likely related to 
late-stage strike-slip movement along the regional faults. 

4 - Many aspects of the geology of the Sergipano Fold Belt demand specific 
research, particularly the detailed study of the age of the sedimentation, the lifhostructurai 
continuity between the southern and northern parts of the belt, and the origin of the 
Canindé, Marancó and Poço Redondo Domains. 

5 - This thesis aims to describe in detail the stratigraphic and structural 
relationships of the Itabaiana Dome Area, and to describe the tectonic evolution of the 
southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt. Further objectives are to apply the data 
resulting from this research for the understanding of the tectonic evolution of the 
Sergipano Fold Belt, and to discuss the implications for the evolution of Pan-African -
Brasiliano fold belts, in particular, and Proterozoic fold belts in general. 

5 - The Itabaiana Dome Area uniquely contains two gneissic domes mantled by a 
relatively well preserved, low grade metasedimentary sequence and basement-cover 
relationships. The research area is so far considered the best region for such detailed 
studies in the Sergipano Fold Belt.

Chapter 3 - Stratigraphy of the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt 

3.1 - Aims 

This chapter aims: 

1 - To present the stratigraphic analysis of the Itabaiana Dome Area. 

2 - To present the stratigraphy of the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt. 

3 - To discuss the implications of the data for the tectonic evolution of the 

Sergipano Fold Belt and adjacent cratonic areas. 

This chapter presents first the geology and stratigraphy of the Itabaiana Dome 

Area with a brief description of the formations, Hthofacies and sedimentary structures. 

This is followed by an analysis of the distribution of the lithofacies and an interpretation 

of the sedimentary environments for the siliciclastic and the carbonate megasequences in 

order to highlight the implications for the paleogeography of the basin in the Itabaiana 

Dome Area. The results of this research are combined with data from the literature, in 

order to erect the stratigraphy of the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt and to 

discuss the implications for the evolution of the Sergipano Fold Belt. 

This chapter contains 22 figures (Figures 3.1-3.22), one table (Table 3.1) and 

additional documentation, presented in the appendix Al (Appendices Al .1 -A 1.8). In all 

the photographs hereafter, the white pen is 12cm long and the hammer 30cm long. Other 

scales are indicated where appropriate. 

The geological map of Figure 3.1 was originally constructed at 1:50,000 scale 

but is presented (enclosure) at 1:100,000 scale. It contains the names of all the relevant 

localities and the outcrops numbered 1-1217. Figure 3.1 is also presented as a summary 

lithostructural map in the main body of this thesis. 

3.2 - Introduction 

The Itabaiana Dome Area is comprised of an amphibolite grade gneiss-granitic 
complex (the crystalline basement) outcropping in the Simão Dias and Itabaiana domes 
and a highly deformed greenschist grade metasedimentary sequence, mostly made up of 
quartzites, phyllites, diamictites and metacarbonates, together with generally flat lying 
sandstones (in the SSW pan of the area, Fig. 3.1). 

The metasediments occur to the west of the the Propria fault, surround the two 
basement domes and extend westward in WNW-ESE trending units. Other rocks in the 
mapped area include the Mesozoic sediments of the Sergipe-Alagoas basin, eastward of 
the Propria fault, and a local fan of Tertiary-Quaternary debris and paraconglomerates in 
the southern part of the Itabaiana dome (Gava et al. 1983). These were not examined in 
detail during this study. 

The Itabaiana dome is a 450km 2 elliptical dome centred around the town of 

Itabaiana (Fig. 3.1). The dome, the longest axis of which extends for 42km in the SW-

NE direction, is surrounded by the Itabaiana quartzites that outcrop in a series of 

prominent ranges.

of the ftabaiana Dome Area. Based on the 
geological map of Figure 3.1 (enclosure).

These ranges are (anticlockwise from south to west, Fig. 3.1): the Montes, 
Cajueiro, Comprida, Itabaiana, Merem, Canção, Capunga, Machado, Saco, Cagado, 
Macambira and Miaba ranges. Figure 3.2 shows a panoramic view of the Miaba range. 
The Simão Dias dome is much smaller than the Itabaiana dome and occurs in the vicinity 
of the town of Simão Dias and to ESE, in a narrow fault-bounded strip, 

The main mappable structures are WNW-ESE or NW-SE trending thrust and 
strike-slip faults and some major folds (Fig. 3.1). From south to north, the main faults 
are the Jacaré, Itaporanga, Simão Dias, Escarpa, Pelada, Mocambo, Ribeirópolis and 
Dores faults (Fig. 3.1). The trace of the main strike-slip faults (the Vaza Barris and the 
Mocambo shears) lies within the metasediments. The Capunga, Montes and other local 
shear zones cut across the eastern and southern borders of the Itabaiana dome. The 
mappable folds generally occur to the north of the Itaporanga fault, and are of a F2 phase 
of folding, such as the Paripiranga anticline and the sequence of folds of die Miaba range 
(Fig. 3.2). 

The geological mapping was carried out on outcrops along roads and tracks, and 

along several streams and rivers (Fig. 3.1): the Vaza Barris and Salgado rivers and 

Jacoquinha stream (west of the Itabaiana dome); the Cova and Montes streams, and the 

Lomba, Trairas and Jaearecica rivers (in the Itabaiana dome); the Sergipe and Dangra 

rivers and the Jacoca, Morcego and Moças streams (east of the dome). 

3.3 - Stratigraphy of the Itabaiana Dome Area 

The metasedimentary cover is divided into the Miaba, Lagarto and Vaza Barris 
Groups which, together form a Mid- to Late Proterozoic, ~1000-4000m thick 
sedimentary wedge unconformably deposited on the Archaean to Early Proterozoic 
Itabaiana and Simão Dias gneisses (Fig. 3.3). 

In the stratigraphic column of Figure 3.3, the pattern of the formations applies to 
the summary map of Figure 3.1, whereas the formation symbols (P€ I, P€ Ja, PC P, 
etc) apply to the full geological map (Fig. 3.1 enclosure). 

The Miaba Group comprises the Itabaiana, the Ribeirópolis and the Jacoca 
Formations. It is conformably covered by the Lagarto Group which comprises the 
Lagarto-Palmares, the Jacaré and the Frei Paulo Formations. The Vaza Barris Group 
unconformably overlies the Lagarto Group and comprises the Palestina and the Olhos 
D'água Formations. 

Although the computation of the thicknesses in the area is generally hampered by 

the polyphase deformation, the relative variations of thickness within each formation can 

be determined in some parts of the area. 

The stratigraphy has been established as the result of the detailed mapping and 

construction of 12 sections across the basement-cover contact (summarised in Fig. 3.4). 

The sections of lines AA' to LL' are plotted on a 1:143,000 scale copy of the 

geological map of the area (Appendix A 1.1, enclosure). The sections AA', EE', GG", 

JJ' correspond to Figures 3.5-3.8. The more complete stratigraphic sections are (Figs. 

3.5 &amp;amp; 3.8) are AA', in the western side of the Simão Dias dome, and JJ' in the

Lagarto Group. Sections BB', C C , DD', FF', HH', II' and KK' contain additional 
information and are presented in the Appendix Al (A 1.2 to A1.8). 

3.3.1 - The crystalline basement 
The crystalline basement is a Rb-Sr 2500Ma old gneissic-granitic complex 

(Hurley 1966). It consists of amphibolite grade, granitic to granodioritic gneisses and 
orthogneisses with mylonites and phyllonites derived from these lithologies. Small, 
local, sheet-like granitic bodies, and disrupted bodies of amphibolites, hornblende 
gabbros and gabbro pyroxenites are also evident. To the south of the Itabaiana Dome 
Area the basement gives 1800 Ma Rb-Sr ages (Brito Neves &amp;amp; Cordani 1973; 
Mascarenhas et al. 1984). 

The gneisses and orthogneisses are composed of coarse-grained (=0.5cm on 
average) quartz, plagioclase and K-feldspars, biotite (hornblende), muscovite, sericite, 
chlorite and epidote. Accessories are apatite, sphene, zircon, and opaque minerals. 
Garnet occurs locally. 

The gneisses and orthogneisses are distinguished by the more or less continuous 
metamorphic banding. The former have a laterally continuous layering defined by bands 
of medium- to coarse-grained quartz and feldspars interbanded, on a centimetric scale, 
with biotite-muscovite-epidote (hornblende) rich bands (Fig. 3.9 A). The orthogneisses 
commonly show an inhomogeneous and less continuous banding with 1 cm size 
feldspar porphyroblasts which are more or less rotated and elongated according to the 
intensity of the local deformation. 

In thin section, both lithologies show commonly elongated quartz grains with 
undulose extinction and saussuritised feldspars. Biotite and muscovite or sericite, and 
chlorite normally occur as fine flakes disposed along banding-parallel mica-domains. 
Biotites are transformed to chlorites along the cleavage surfaces which have associated 
with thin Films of red-brown iron oxide. Where found, hornblende is commonly 
retrogressed to epidote. 

Basement-derived mylonites generally consist of a &amp;lt;lmm fine-grained matrix 
and mm-size porphyroclasts of K-feldpars, plagioclase and epidote. They commonly 
show S-C fabric relationships (Lister &amp;amp; Snoke 1984). The matrix consists of 
recrystallised quartz and feldspars grains with a preferred orientation parallel to the S 
planes. The C planes are marked by extremely fine grained quartz, epidote, sericite, 
chlorite and biotite. 

3.3.2 - The basement-cover contact 

The crystalline basement is overlain by the Itabaiana, Ribeirópolis, Palestina and 
Olhos D'água Formations (Fig. 3.1). The basement-cover contact is generally low-angle 
dipping around the Itabaiana dome (dipping away from the centre, in alt directions) and 
in the western Simão Dias dome, but dips at high-angles in the rest of the area.

Despite discontinuous outcrops and the weathered appearance of the grasses in 
some places, it can be seen that the basement and cover are generally sheared or 
mylonitic along the contact the basement-cover contact is mostly undeformed along the 
eastern margin of the Itabaiana dome (Fig. 3.9 B). and in parts of the western border, 
between the town of Macambira and the northern edge of the Miaba range (Fig. 3.1) 

In the Macambira area, however, the Itabaiana quartzites occur in some places 

directly above basement-derived quartz-feldspar- sericite-chlorite phyllonites. Southwest 

of Macambira, where a secondary road cuts the basal contact and leaves the dome to the 

west (Fig. 3.1, outcrop 323), the phyllonites dip 20° to NNW and are affected by small-

scale, asymmetric, WNW verging folds and by a pervasive and finely spaced se, of 

shear bands which dip 25° to WNW (Fig. 3.9 C). 
These structures indicate a top down to WNW extensional movement. In thin 

section, the basal Itabaiana quartzites from this locality are also mylonitic. They contain 
elongated, pulled-apart and rotated feldspar grains, and elongated quartz grams, berth 
with pressure shadow zones. The structures shown in the quartzites resemble 
imperfectly developed shear bands (Fig. 3.9 D) but also indicate a top down to the 
WNW movement. 

The phyllonites can be traced southwards from outcrop 323 to outcrop 1217 in 
the Cova stream (Fig. 3.1), where the phyllonitic foliation dips 55° to W and the 

extensional shear bands dip 50° to WNW. 
Humphrey &amp;amp; Allard (1969) described that in the northern edge of the Miaba 

range the phyllomtes trend to the SW and pass underneath the locally SE trending basal 
unconformity, between the Itabaiana quartzites and the gneisses. They also described 
NW trending meso-scale folds that have deformed the phyllonites, together with the 

shear bands and the Itabaiana quartzites. 
In at least two other western localities the Itabaiana gneisses are also affected by 

low-angle, WNW dipping local extensional faults (outcrop 554, ENE of Macambira) or 
extensional shear bands mostly affecting the mica-rich layers (outcrop 1215, Cova 
stream). A generally low-angle, WNW plunging mineral stretching lineation is also 
present in these outcrops. All of the kinematic indicators observed in these outcrops 
indicate top down to WNW extensional movement. 

3.3.3 - The Miaba Group 
The Miaba Group consists of the Itabaiana quartzites, the Ribeirópohs pebbly 

phyllites, and the Jacoca carbonates. The thickness of this group varies from 200m. in 

the western Simão Dias dome, to 1100m on the eastern and western sides of the 

Itabaiana dome. 

The Itabaiana Formation (P€ I) 
The Itabaiana Formation is 400-700m thick in the eastern and western borders of 

the Itabaiana dome, 30-200m in the rest of the area, and is comprised of a sandy and a 

muddy lithofacies (Fig. 3.10).

The sandy lithofacies surrounds most of the Itabaiana dome, the western part of 
the Simão Dias dome and is also found in the Volta range (in the NE corner of the area). 
It consists of white to grey or yellow, fine to medium grained (0.15 - 0.50mm) 
feldspathic quartzites, orthoquartzites and minor, decimetre to centimetre-thick siltstone 
beds. Mappable slices of mylonitic Itabaiana quartzites occur within the Simão Dias 
gneiss (Fig. 3.1). 

The muddy lithofacies occurs along the Redonda and Campina ranges to the 
north of the Itabaiana dome (Fig. 3.1) and also in the western part of Simão Dias dome. 
It consists of 1 m-thick layers of arkosic sandstones and arkosic quartzites interbedded 
with 1m-thick layers of reddish brown mudstones and phyllites. 

The most typical section (Fig. 3.8) starts with local bodies of 10m-thick matrix-
supported conglomerates and conglomeratic sandstones, with basement-derived clasts. 
These pass gradually into 100's of metres of 10-30cm thick beds of white to grey, fine 
to medium-grained, small to meso-scale parallel cross-bedded feldspathic quartzites (Fig, 
3.10 A). 

At the top, this fining upwards sequence consists of grey to reddish brown, fine-
grained metasandstones, metasiltites and meta-argillites, but l-10m-thick lenses of 
conglomerates (Fig. 3.10 B) or conglomeratic and cross-bedded sandstones may occur 
instead, particularly to the eastern and western margins of the Itabaiana dome. 

The basal feldspathic content ( 20%) diminishes up-section and most of the 
Itabaiana Formation shows a remarkably homogeneous quartzitic composition (with less 
than 5% of opaque minerals, zircon and tourmaline as accessories). Herring bone cross-
stratification, convolute laminations and wavy laminations are also displayed. 

The muddy lithofacies consists of muddy and micaceous quartzites and/or 10-
100cm thick layers of parallel cross-bedded, arkosic metasandstones intercalated with 
red-brown phyllites (Fig. 3.10 C). 

The correlation of the quartzites and muddy lithofacies which occur along the 
Campina, Redonda and Volta ranges (originally mapped as quartzitic lenses of the Frei 
Paulo-Ribeirópolis Formation, in Gava et al. 1983 and Santos et al. 1988) with the 
typical Itabaiana quartzites is supported by (a): the gradual passage of the Itabaiana 
quartzites to the muddy lithofacies in road cuts in the Redonda and Machado ranges; and 
(b): the Volta thrust, in the northeastern corner of the area, which places muddy, 
micaceous quartzites and unmappable slices of basement-derived mylonites over the Frei 
Paulo phyllites. 

The Ribeirópolis Formation (P€ R) 

The Ribeirópolis Formation is proposed here as a formation to merge the 
Jacarecica Formation and the Ribeirópolis facies of the Frei Paulo-Ribeirópolis 
Formation of the old stratigraphy (Figs. 2.3 &amp;amp; 2.5 B). 

This proposal is based on field evidence which shows a gradual passage from the 

quartzites and interbedded arkosic metasandstones and phyllites (Itabaiana Formation in 

the northern part of this study area) to red-brown silty phyllites in the Machado and 

Redonda ranges (Fig. 3.1). These phyllites continue up to the northern end of the area, 

4 9 



across the Ribeirópolis town where, together with lenses of pebbly phyllites and 
intermediary and acid volcanic rocks, form the Ribeirópolis facies of the Frei Paulo-
Ribeirópolis Formation (Gava et al. 1983; Santos et al. 1988). This assemblage is very 
much similar to the assemblage mapped in gradual transition to the Itabaiana quartzites in 
the western Simão Dias dome (Appendices A 1.2-A 1.3) and which Humphrey &amp;amp; Allard 
(1967, 1969) mapped in the Jacarecica Formation. 

The Ribeirópolis Formation consists of pebbly phyllites and local conglomerates 
(Figs. 3.11 A &amp;amp; B), white, grey to red-brown silty phyllites (Fig. 3.11 C), 
metagreywackes, argillites, quartz-sericite phyllites (Appendix A1.8) and generally 
weathered metavolcanic rocks with acid to intermediary composition. All these rocks 
were previously in the Jacarecica Formation and in part of the Frei Paulo-Ribeirópolis 
Formation (Silva Filho et al. 1978 a &amp;amp; b). 

The Ribeirópolis Formation occurs in gradational contact with the Itabaiana 
Formation. In one locality (Flecheira farm, outcrop 471, Fig. 3.1) the contact is sheared 
along a low-angle, WNW dipping ramp. The formation is 0-300rn thick around the 
basement domes, but may attain 500m along the WNW-ESE trending belts to the north 
and south of the Itabaiana dome. A small body of pebbly phyllites is mappable between 
the towns of Frei Paulo and Macambira (Fig. 3.1). 

Due to the great variety of lithofacies, this formation lacks a type-section, but 
generally the pebbly phyllites and conglomerates occupy basal positions and the phyllitic 
facies occurs towards the top of the unit. 

It is noticeable that in part of the western Simão Dias dome the Ribeirópolis 
Formation consists of highly foliated intermediate metavolcanics and blue to green colour 
phyllites (A 1.2), and that the conglomeratic lithofacies are more important in the eastern 
and western Itabaiana dome, where a thin and discontinuous layer of coarse sandy-
supported, well-cemented, brown, coarsening-up conglomerate is present (Fig. 3.6). 

A composite stratigraphic section through the Ribeirópolis Formation (Fig. 3.8) 
starts with white to grey, or light brown, silty argillites with parallel stratification, 
containing l-10m-thick intercalations of fine- to medium-grained metagreywackes, 
graded bedded 5mm-grained conglomeratic sandstones, and pebbly phyllites with 10-
15cm size clasts of basement rocks, milky quartz and quartzites. 

This sequence passes upwards into finely laminated grey meta-argillites and light 
brown metasiltites which are overlain by light brown, calcareous phyllites with 
intercalations of carbonaceous phyllites. This succession indicates a gradual passage 
upward to the overlying Jacoca Formation. The basal third of this type section also 
occurs in the western Itabaiana dome where basal, white to grey, silty phyllites locally 
contain 5cm size clasts of quartzites and basement rocks (Appendix Al .4). 

On the northern side of the Itabaiana dome (Fig. 3.7) the formation starts with 
red-brown to purple silty phyllites, and passes northward with intercalations of pebbly 
phyllites, light brown and purple phyllites, and possible porphyroclastic units 
(weathered metarhyolites and metadacites have been described as part of this sequence 
by Santos et al. 1988). At the southern margin of the dome, light brown silty phyllites 
with thin intercalations of fine metagreywackes are found (Appendix A1.8).

The Jacoca Formation ( P € Ja) 
The Jacoca Formation conformably overlies the Ribeirópolis Formation with a 

gradual or sharp contact. Locally it is in direct contact with the Itabaiana quartzites 
(outcrop 312, Capitão farm, Fig. 3.1). 

The Jacoca Formation is comprised of two lithofacies: metacarbonates and a 
mixed lithofacies of metasiliciclastics and metacarbonates, or mixtites. The 
metacarbonates occur as 100-300m thick mappable bodies around the eastern and 
western parts of the Itabaiana dome (Fig. 3.1). The mixtites are absent or 100m thick in 
the western part of the Simão Dias dome and in a WNW-ESE trending band mapped to 
the north of the Mocambo fault (Fig. 3.1). 

The best exposures of the metacarbonates are in the steep walls along the Salgado 
and Vaza Barris rivers, in the Capitão farm (outcrops 311-312, Fig. 3.1) where a vertical 
succession of sub-Iithofacies can be followed in deformed and relatively undeformed 
areas. 

The typical section (Fig. 3.12) starts with a 3m thick layer of laminated white to 

light grey, l-3cm thick beds of dolomites containing lcm thick beds of pyrite and 

chalcopyrite. These are overlain by a 15m thick layer of thinly laminated dolomites, 

light brown metachert and calcitic, dark grey to black phyllites and 10m of massive 

dolomites. In thin section, the finely laminated dolomites display a typical marble texture 

of equigranular recrystallised calcite grains, interbedded with 1mm-thick micaceous 

layers composed of sericite, chlorite, biotite, very fine grained quartz and feldspars. 

These define a layer-parallel foliation. 

This unit is overlain by a 40m thick sequence of intercalate, l-10cm thick 
layers of grey limestones, calcarenites, and dark grey to black, locally carbonaceous 
phyllites. These units display parallel laminations and wave truncated current ripples 
(Fig. 3.13) and pass upwards into a 200m thick sequence of lm thick layers of light 
grey metadolomites. 

Detailed studies in the lower and upper sections of this formation in the Capitão 
farm area have also revealed local lm-scale hummocky cross-stratifications (Castro 
1987) and abundant oolites and intraclasts (Guimarães et al. 1991). 

In the eastern part of the Itabaiana dome (Fig. 3.8) the Jacoca Formation consists 
of thinly-laminated, light and dark grey, fine-grained limestones with local, 10cm-thick 
intercalations of black to dark grey metachert. In the headwaters of the Morcego stream 
(Appendix A 1.6), the formation consists of interbedded, l-10cm thick layers of dark 
grey to black, fine-grained limestones interlayered with light brown metapelites. These 
pass gradually, along the section, into the green-brown quartz-sericite-chlorite phyllites 
of the overlying Frei Paulo Formation. 

The mixtites consist of discontinuous, 10m thick lenses of light grey dolomites 
hosted within dominantly light brown phyllites in the western Simão Dias dome (Fig. 
3.5 &amp;amp; Appendix A1.3). To the north of the Mocambo fault, they occur as a sequence of 
1m thick layers of dark grey to black and fine-grained limestones intercalated with light 
brown to variegated phyllites.

3.3.4 - The Lagarto Group 
The Lagarto Group is a name proposed here to identify a new stratigraphic unit 

in the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt. It is a 100-700m thick coarsening-up 

siliciclastic sequence which conformably overlies the Miaba Group and is mappable in 

the southern part of the studied area (Fig. 3.14), as well as in the core of the Paripiranga 

anticline (Appendix A1.2) and to the east of the Itabaiana dome (Fig, 3.8). 

The Lagarto Group comprises three interfingering Formations: the Lagarto-

Palmares sandstones, the Jacaré metasiltites and the Frei Paulo phyllites. 

The Lagarto-Palmares Formation comprises the Lagarto and Palmares 

Formations described by Silva Filho et al. (1978b) and Silva Filho (1982). It is based on 

field observations for a gradual transition between these rocks in the Itabaiana Dome 

Area (Fig. 3.14 and Appendix A 1.2) which confirms the same relationship described in 

a cratonic area, 100km to the south of Itabaiana (Saes 1984). 

The interfingering of the Lagarto-Palmares sandstones with the Frei Paulo 

phyllites in the southern part of the study area, through a WNW-ESE trending band of 

metasiltites, has required the definition of the Jacaré Formation. 

The Lagarto-Palmares Formation (P€ LP) 

The Lagarto-Palmares Formation is a coarsening-upward sequence of mudstones 
and siltites, fine sandstones and siltites, and medium, massive sandstones (Fig. 3.15). 
These can be subdivided into a basal, an intermediate and an upper unit. 

Although these sediments are flat-lying everywhere in the southern part of the 
area, the maximum thickness of the formation is actually unknown as the upper unit 
covers most of the lower units, and the upper surface is erosional. The thickness of 

200m adopted here for each of the lower two units is taken from descriptions by (Silva 
Filho 1978b), based on well data and measured sections outside the area of this study. 
The preserved thickness of the third unit is estimated at 300m on the basis of 
topographic relationships. 

The Lagarto-Palmares Formation conformably overlies the Jacoca Formation but 
may well be locally in contact with the Itabaiana and Ribeirópolis Formations, as 
suggested in the western part of the Símão Dias dome, in places where the Jacoca 
Formation is not directly observed (e.g. outcrops 289 to 285, Fig. 3.1, and Appendix 
A1.2). 

The basal unit consists of mudstones and siltstones intercalated with 10-20cm 

thick lenses of generally 0.15mm grain size, cross bedded sandstones (Fig. 3.15 A), 

and is dominant along the southern border of the study area. The sandy layers are 

marked by repeated cycles of 1 cm parallel lamination capped by generally symmetric 

and small-scale wave ripples, bounded by sharp truncation surfaces (Fig. 3.15 B). 

The intermediate unit consists of fine-grained ( 0.15mm grain size), light brown 

to grey, l-10cm thick layers of laterally continuous micaceous sandstones interlayered 

with 1mm-lcm thick layers of red-brown argillites and siltites. These are the typical 

Lagarto sandstones, as described by Silva Filho et al. (1978b) and Silva Filho (1982). 

They commonly display the cyclic sequences of micaceous sandstones and red-brown

argillites, as seen in the outcrop 283 (road Simão Dias-Lagarto) and outcrops 156-158 
(St. Antônio farm, S of the Simão Dias town, Fig. 3.1). These features are also seen in 
the outcrops 434, 435 in the Comandante farm, and outcrop 484 in the Limeira farm (S 
of the Itabaiana dome, Fig. 3.1). 

The upper unit of the Lagarto-Palmares Formation starts with cm-thick layers of 
fine to medium grained, brown to grey, parallel-laminated micaceous sandstones, with 
abundant symmetric wave ripples and wave-ripple cross stratification (Fig. 3.15 C). 
This passes, in a continuous road-cut exposure, into a sequence of metre-scale beds of 
either massive or parallel-laminated, green-grey, calcite-cemented micaceous sandstones 
and wackes (Fig. 3.15 D). Primary structures, such as sand-mud couplets, disrupted 
muddy layers, sand dikes, and fluid-escape structures are found (Fig. 3.15 E-G), 
together with metre-scale parallel cross stratification indicative of a northward 
sedimentary input into the basin (Fig. 3.15 H). 

The massive sandstones correspond to the Palmares Formation, as described by 
Silva Filho et ai. (1978b) and Silva Filho (1982). They contain l-10mm size discoid 
fragments of reworked, red-brown mudstones, and a typical bedding-fracture controlled 
pattern of erosion that produces rounded boulders (Fig. 3.15 D). These boulders 
dominate the topography of the southern area and are particularly seen along the road 
Itabaiana-Lagarto, and also in expressive outcrops mapped in the core of the Paripiranga 
anticline (Fig. 3.15 I K ) . 

Petrographic studies (Table 3.1) have shown that the sandstones of the Lagarto-
Palmares Formation are submature sediments, composed by subangular to subrounded, 
generally 0,15-0.45mm size grains of quartz, k-feldspars, plagioclase, granite, opaque 
minerals, zircon, and aggregates of micro-crystalline quartz, calcite, epidote and flakes 
of muscovite. Some grains of micro-crystalline quartz suggest derivation from 
mylonites, and few clasts of extremely fine-grained material might be derived from 
phyllonites, phyllites, or even volcanic rocks. Flakes of biotite and chlorite are found 
kinked, but the chlorite also occurs in zones of diffuse boundaries, possibly formed by 
low grade metamorphism. 

In the cratonic area Saes (1984) described a mineral composition for the Palmares 
sandstones similar to that in Table 3.1, and interpreted the source areas as granite-gneiss 
crystalline basement with belts of low grade metamorphic rocks. 

The J a c a r é Formation (PC Je) 

This formation consists essentially of light brown, micaceous, 10-100cm thick 
layers of metasiltites, or consists of light brown to variegated metasiltites (Fig. 3.16 A) 
with subordinated, l-10m thick lensoid bodies of fine- to medium-grained, light brown 
metasandstones. 

The metasiltites are mappable along an E-W trending band in the southern area 
and in the core of the Paripiranga anticline (Fig. 3.1). The thickness is estimated as 
=150-200m (Fig. 3.14) but is probably less in the core of the Paripiranga anticline, 
where the outcrop width is smaller.

Table 3.1 Petrography of the sandstones of the Lagarto group. 

In samples DR-155, 159, 284, 285, 434 and 485, the matrix and the cement include 
mostly very fine-grained quartz, sericite, carbonate and iron (?) oxide. Grain size is 
0,15-0.45mm and the grains are generally subangular to subrounded, with low to high 
sphericity, in samples DR-212, 1167, 1171 and 1173 (deformed calcareous metasandstonea 
of the Frei Paulo formation in the northern part of the area), the matrix and cement 
include mostly carbonate, very fine quartz, sericite and iron {?} oxide. 
In all the samples, micas are flakes of muscoviie, biotite and chlorite (some are kinked). 
Other minerals include mostly opaque grains, some zircon and epidote. 
Lithic fragments are mostly from very fine-grained quartz aggregates (mylonites), 
gneisses or granites, metachert, and grains entirely consisting of very fine-grained 
sericite and quartz (possibly from phyllites or metavoicanics). 
% Q,F,L, means normalized percentage to Q=quartz+quartzite+chert, 
F=feldspars+plagioclase, and L=lithic fragments.'

In the vicinity of faults and shear zones, these rocks attain a dark brown to black 

colour, are silicified and indurated, and show a vitreous texture, as observed in outcrops 

437, 438 and 485 within the Comandante and Limeira farms (Fig. 3.1). 

The Frei Paulo Formation (P€ FP, FP1, FP3) 
The Frei Paulo Formation is widespread (Fig. 3.1): it occurs along a WNW-ESE 

band in contact with the Jacaré Formation, in the southern part of the study area, and 

also in a WNW-ESE trending band passing around the Frei Paulo town. It is also 

mapped around the basement domes, as well as in the Vaza Barris river valley (between 

the Escarpa and Pelada faults), and to the west of the Paripiranga town. The thickness is 

estimated between = 100m (in the western part of the Simão Dias dome) and 300m to 

&gt;500m elsewhere, particularly in the Vaza Barris valley area. 

This formation comprises rocks of the original Frei Paulo and Capitão 

Formations, as defined by Humphrey &amp;amp; Allard (1967,1969), and rocks of the Frei 

Paulo-Ribeirópolis Formation, as defined by Silva Filho et ai. (1978b). It also 

incorporates new areas where the typical Frei Paulo phyllites were mapped during the 

course of this research, such as those narrow bands to the north of the Escarpa and 

Mocambo faults, and to the south of the Pelada fault (Fig. 3.1). 

The Frei Paulo Formation is comprised of three main lithofacies respectively 
termed PG FP, FP1 and FP3 (Fig. 3.1, enclosure). The lithofacies P€ FP consists of 1-
10mm thick beds of light grey to brown, silty and variegated phyllites, which are the 
typical Frei Paulo phyllites (Fig. 3.16 B). 

The lithofacies FP1 consists of trappable bodies of arkosic metasandstones and 
wackes. It also consists of light brown phyllites with -10-100cm thick interbedded 
layers of fine- to medium-grained metasandstones (e.g. outcrops 846, 848-850, to the 
west of Paripiranga, Fig. 3.1) or even tens of metres thick bodies of metasandstones and 
quartzites (e.g. outcrops 353, 354, and 356, to the west of Macambira). 

The lithofacies FP3 comprises quartz-sericite-chlorite phyllites and intercalated 
fine- to medium-grained metagreywackes (Fig. 3.16 C), light brown phyllites associated 
with thinly interbedded dark grey to black phyllites, metasiltites, calcilutites (or 
metarhytmites, Fig. 3.16 D) and interbedded limestones and metagrey wackes (Fig. 
3.17). 

The variegated phyllites are a key horizon as they are found overlying the Jacoca 

carbonates, to the east and west of the Itabaiana dome, and underlying the Palestina 

diamictites to the west of the Simão Dias dome (Fig. 3.1). Their lateral and vertical 

juxtaposition with the other lithofacies is observed in the stratigraphic sections across the 

eastern and western parts of the Itabaiana dome (Fig. 3.6 &amp;amp; Appendices A1.4-A1.6), 

and also between the Jacarecica river section (Fig. 3.8) and the variegated silty phyllites 

that occur along the Areia Branca-Saco Torto road (outcrops 371, 372, Fig. 3.1). 

Each lithofacies of the Frei Paulo Formation is dominant, but not exclusive, in a 

particular area geographically related to the regional faults. The variegated silty phyllites 

are most important to the south of the Escaipa fault, whereas between the Escarpa and 

Pelada faults, and in the eastern side of the Itabaiana dome, the main lithofacies are the

metasandstones, the metarhythmites and interbedded metagreywackes and 

metalimestones. 

Around the town of Frei Paulo (Fig. 3.1), the Frei Paulo Formation consists of 

light-brown and silty phyllites with common intercalations (some of them mappable) of 

brown to green-grey, fine- to medium-grained, calcite-cemented, micaceous 

metasandstones. The petrography of these sandstones is similar to the Lagarto-Palmares 

sandstones and wackes, but the carbonate content is greater (Table 3.1). 

The very narrow band of the Frei Paulo Formation, which lies just to the north of 

the Mocambo fault (Fig. 3.1), consists of light-grey to brown silty phyllites to the NE of 

Pinhão (outcrops 275 and 816), to the NNW of Macambira, towards to Frei Paulo 

(outcrops 541 and 1009) and in the northwestern comer of the area (outcrop 1086). It 

also consists of brown silty phyllites and fine-grained, calcite-cemented metasandstones 

with l-10cm thick lenses of black and very fine-grained limestones (outcrops 1165 and 

1166) which occur along the Mocambo fault zone. In this area, the Mocambo fault is 

hundreds of metres wide and controls the local E-W trend of the Salgado river and a 

small tributary to the west. 

The metasandstones are more weathering-resistant and are breeciated in some 

scattered places along the fault, but a microscopic study of fresher samples has revealed 

the same petrography of the fine to medium grained, micaceous, calcite-cemented 

metasandstones mapped within the Frei Paulo Formation along the track from the 

Salgado to Riachão and Rosa Amélia farms (outcrops 1167 to 1173, southeast of 

Mocambo). These sandstones are also observed within the Frei Paulo phyllites, to the 

west of the Paripiranga town (outcrop 848) and lm-thick intercalations of 

metasandstones and metagreywackes occur just to the north of the Comandante farm, 

where approaching the Escarpa fault and entering into the Vaza Barris river valley 

(outcrops 441-443, Fig. 3.1). 

Parallel lamination is the most typical sedimentary structure observed in the Frei 

Paulo Formation, though small-scale wave-ripples and parallel cross stratification are 

found locally (outcrop 7 1 , S of Simão Dias). 

3.3.5 - T h e Vaza B a r r i s G r o u p 

The Vaza Barris Group is a 2000m-thick sequence unconformably overlying the 
previous formations and the crystalline basement, and comprising the Palestina 
diamictites and the Olhos Dágua metacarbonates. The group does not include the 
Capitão Formation of Humphrey &amp;amp; Allard (1967, 1969) and the Frei Paulo-Ribeirópolis 
Formation defined by Silva Filho et al. (1978 a,b) and redefined by Santos et al. 
(1988). 

The Palestina F o r m a t i o n (P€ P) 

This formation consists of diamictites, pebbly phyllites and minor phyllites, and 

contains local, generally 10m thick lenses of quartzites. It corresponds to the original 

Palestina Formation as defined by Humphrey &amp;amp; Allard (1967, 1969).

The diamictites and pebbly phyllites consist of generally flatenned and elongated 
granules, pebbles and cobbles of basement rocks with less clasts from quartzites, 
phyllites, and metacarbonates. They are supported in a green- to blue-grey, extremely 
fine and foliated sericitic-chloritic matrix (Fig. 3.18). 

The variations in thicknesses and lithological characteristics of this formation is 
evident from the outcrops in the Vaza Barris river valley, those in the Jacarecica river, 
and those around the Simão Dias dome (Fig. 3.1). A thin body of highly deformed 
pebbly phyllites occur within mylonitic gneisses in a l00 m-scale outcrop nearby the 
village of Olhos D'água (outcrop 395, Fig. 3.1). 

In the area confined between the Escarpa and Pelada faults, the diamictites are 
much more significant than elsewhere, and die thickness is roughly estimated to be 

500m. Clasts greater than 10cm are common and the matrix is generally more phyllitic 
than elsewhere (Fig. 3.18 A). Lenses of dark brown to black, medium to coarse-grained 
quartzites occur locally. 

In the Jacarecica river, the diamictites are found only in a narrow body which is 
folded within the quartz-sericite-chlorite phyllites and metasandstones of the Frei Paulo 
Formation. They contain irregular boulders and pebbles of Itabaiana quartzites and 
Lagarto-Palmares metasandstones (Fig. 3.18 B), which have not been found in the rest 
of the area, nor reported in the literature. 

Around the Simão Dias dome the thickness of the Palestina Formation is 
probably 100m. The matrix is siltier than elsewhere and the clasts are generally smaller 
than 10cm (Fig. 3.18 C), although an isolated metre-scale block of granitic rock has 
been found near the trace of the Simão Dias fault (outcrop 90, very close to the SE of 
Paripiranga, Fig. 3.1). 

The Olhos D'aágua Formation (P€ OA) 
The Olhos D'água Formation is 200-1300m thick and consists of 

metacarbonates that conformably overlie the Palestina diamictites (Fig. 3.1). It can be 
described in terms of three different lithofacies (Fig. 3.19): laminated carbonate 
rhythmites, oolitic limestones and dolostones, and mixed carbonate and siliciclastics 
(mixtites). 

The best exposures are along the section from Paripiranga to the north (Fig. 3.5). 
The section starts with hundreds of metres of laminated metacarbonate rhythmites, 
which consist of l-10cm thick and interbedded layers of light and dark grey to black, 
fine-grained limestones, with local l-3cm thick intercalations of light brown metasiltites 
(Fig. 3.19 A), brown to purple metapelites and chert. Small to medium-scale cross 
stratification are found locally. 

These rocks pass up section into a sequence (probably also 100's of metres thick) 
metalimestones and metadolostones consisting of interbedded, l-10cm thick layers of 
fine-grained, black limestones, in many places oolitic, pelloidal andoncolitic (Fig. 3.19 
B).This lithofacies also contains l-10mm thick intercalations of brown metapelites, and 
10-100m thick layers of grey to light-brown doloarenites which display small-scale 
parallel cross stratification, wave scours, intraclasts and graded bedding (Fig. 3.19 C).

At the top of the section, this sequence passes gradually into hundreds of metres 
of mixtites, which consist of fine-grained, 10-100cm thick beds of black limestones, 
intercalated with l-10cm thick layers of brown to red-brown, commonly variegated, 
pyritic metapelites (Fig. 3.19 D). 

These mixtites form the WNW-ESE trending hills that occur along the Escarpa 
and Pelada faults (Fig. 3.1), and the siliciclastic interbeds become increasingly 
significant northward. This can be observed along the road Simão Dias to Pinhão and 
along the Salgado river, to the northwest of Macambira, going from the Jacoquinha farm 
to the Mocambo fault (Fig. 3.1) where there are several 10-100cm thick intercalations of 
dark grey to black phyllites (outcrops 1160-1164). 

The Olhos D'água Formation also occurs in the Capitão range, in the NW corner 
of the area, and in two separate bodies cut by the Propria fault, to the east of the 
Itabaiana dome (Fig. 3.1), where the laminated meiacarbonate rhythmites dominate and 
appear to show a gradual passage from the green-grey Frei Paulo phyllites (see 
Appendix A1.6). 

3.4 - Lithofacies and depositional environments 

3.4.1 - Lithofacies distribution and paleogeography 

Straügraphically, the sedimentary record of the Itabaiana Dome Area can be 
summarised in terms of two siliciclastic and two carbonate megasequences. The 
siliciclastics megasequences start respectively with the Itabaiana Formation and the 
Lagarto Group, the upper part of each being completed with conglomeratic/volcanic 
facies (the Ribeirópolis and Palestina Formations). The carbonate megasequences 
comprise respectively the lithofacies of the Jacoca and Olhos D'água Formations. 

Figure 3.20 A shows the facies distribution throughout the area. Figure 3.20 B 
attempts to show a block diagram constructed with interpretative cross sections in the 
basin (AA' to DD'). It is evident from Figure 3.20 A that the sedimentary record shows 
a wide distribution of facies (and thickness) associated with the basement domes and the 
Pelada, Escarpa, Simão Dias and Itaporanga faults (which are projected vertically down 
into the cross-sections of Fig. 3.20 B). 

If such variations are an indicator of sedimentary sources at different distances 
from the depocenters, as generally found in shallow water environments (Fairchild 
1989), some aspects of the evolution of the sedimentation in the Itabaiana Dome Area 
deserve particular attention. This may be considered in terms of particular times of 
sedimentation (Fig. 3.20): Tl = Itabaiana time, T2 = Ribeirópolis-Jacoca time, T3 = 
Lagarto Group time, T4 = Palestina time and T5 = Olhos D'água time.

Chapter 4 - Structures and metamorphism of the Itabaiana Dome Area 

4.1 - Introduction 

This chapter aims to present the structural analysis of the Itabaiana Dome Area 
and to discuss the implications for the evolution of the southern part of the Sergipano 
Fold Belt. 

The description of the structures in the Itabaiana Dome Area is followed by an 
interpretation of the structural evolution of the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt. 
The data are also discussed to produce an interpretation of a tectonic regime likely to 
explain the field and laboratory observations made during this research. 

The chapter contains 24 figures (Figs. 4.1-4.24), two table (Tables 4.1-4.2) and 
an appendix on strain analysis (Appendices A2.1-A2.3). The geological map of the 
Itabaiana dome (Fig. 3.1, enclosure) shows the section lines of the main structural cross 
sections (AB, CD, E F ) presented in Figure 4.20 (enclosure). The localities and outcrop 
numbers are found on the geological map of Figure 3.1. 

Hereafter, where mentioned the X, Y and Z axis, and the XZ, XY and YZ 
planes, the author is referring respectively to the orthogonal axis and planes of the D2 
(second deformational event) finite strain ellipsoid, deduced for each outcrop on the 
basis of the available macro and microscopic structural relationships. 

4.2 - The structures of the Itabaiana Dome Area - Introduction 
Figure 4.1 is a summary lithostructural map of the Itabaiana Dome Area. The 

main structures are F1 and F2 folds, with their associated foliations and lineations, and a 
set of WNW-ESE striking high-angle thrust and sinistral strike-slip regional faults. 

The F1 folds are inferred structures which occur to the west and north of the 
Simão Dias dome, respectively within the Frei Paulo Olhos D'água and Jacoca 
Formations (Fig. 4.1). The F2 folds are mostly the Paripiranga anticline (to the west of 
the Simão Dias dome), some overturned sync lines and anticlines which occur to the 
north, northwest and west of the Itabaiana dome, and the open folds which affect the 
Miaba range, in the western side of this dome (Fig. 4.1). 

The regional faults are the Itaporanga, Simão Dias, Escarpa, Pelada, Mocambo, 
Ribeirópolis and Dores faults. The main strike-slip faults are the dextral strike-slip Vaza 
Barris fault and the Mocambo dextral shear. Other NW-SE trend strike-slip faults cut 
across the Itabaiana quartzites and also affect the basement, in the eastern and southern 
margins of the Itabaiana dome. 

The Itabaiana Dome Area is comprised of a domain of cratonic, non deformed 
and non metamorphosed sediments, and a domain of highly deformed, green schist facies 
metasediments and minor metavolcanics mantling the Itabaiana and Simão Dias gneissic 
domes. 

The cratonic domain lies on the southwestern corner of the area and is separated 

from the deformed and metamorphosed domain by the Itaporanga fault (Fig. 4.1). The 

81

deformed metasedimentary wedge occupies the rest of the area, but is separated by die 
SSW-NNE striking Propriá fault from the Mesozoic Sergipe-Alagoas basin, in the 
southeastern part of the area. 

As will be described along this chapter, the structures of the Itabaiana dome 
record three ductile to ductile-brittle deformational events ( D J - D - J ) characterised by 
folds, faults and shear zones and accompanied by a sub-greenschist to greenschist 
metamorphism. 

These events affected the bedding of the metasediments (S0) and the 
metamorphic banding of crystalline basement (Sn), and developed a varied set of planar 
features (axial plane foliations and fold axial planes) and linear features (fold axis, 
intersection and elongation lineations). The folds, planar and linear features belonging to 
each D 1-D3 deformational event are respectively termed F j - F 3 , S1-S3; and Lj-L3 and are 
defined in detail in Table 4.1. 

4.2.1 - Basement structures 
The basement certainly underwent earlier deformations, as 10-100cm size 

isoclinal, rootless folds are intrafolial to the metamorphic banding in highly foliated 
gneisses cut by the undeformed basal unconformity (e.g. Fig. 3.9 B). Nevertheless, the 
scarcity of such evidence precludes the establishment of the earlier evolution of the 
crystalline basement, before the deformation events which are the focus of this thesis. 

More than that, the basement also shows evidence of being affected by three 
folding events, which correspond to the structures affecting the metasedimentary cover, 
as will be demonstrated in this chapter. 

For simplicity, terms such as Sn - 1, F n + 1 , etc, to describe the structures in the 
basement will be avoided, and the metamorphic banding of the gneisses and 
orthogneisses (Sn) is simply considered the planar feature to be affected by the D 1 D 3 
deformational evolution (Table 4.1). 

4.2.2 - Summary of the deformational events and structural 
domains 

The D1 deformation affects So and Sn and is represented by recumbent folds 
(F1), associated with the axial planar foliation (S1), and with an intersection lineation 
L1-0) the D2 deformation is characterised by nearly upright folds (F2), which co-
axially refold F, folds and S1,. Planar structures associated with F2 folds are the axial 
plane (PA2) and an axial planar foliation (S2). The linear features, generically termed L2, 
are the fold axis (B 2), the intersection lineation L1-2 and an stretching lineation (Ls,). D2 
is also responsible for the high-angle thrust faults observed in the area (Fig. 4.1). 

The D3 deformation is indicated by transversal, commonly upright folds (F3), 
which affect S2 (and the older planar structures). The associated planar elements are the 
axial plane (PA3) and the axial plane foliation (S3), whereas the linear elements are the 
fold axis (B3) and an intersection lineation (L3_2). 

The relative chronology between the deformational events has been distinguished 
on the basis of many examples of refolded folds, folded foliations, combined with cross-

cutting relationships of foliations. Refolded folds are considered the best evidence 

amongst other available criteria for regional correlations of structures in polydeformed 

areas (Williams 1985). 

The superposition of D1 and D2 deformation events on rocks which have 

different mechanical behaviours, developed an accentuated structural partitioning and a 
strong anysotropy with a regional WNW-ESE trend in the study area (Fig. 4.1). 

As a consequence, six structural domains have been defined in the Itabaiana 

Dome Area, on the basis of different styles of the F2 folds, the relative attitude of Sl and 

S2, and also using the nature of the S2 foliation together with variations in the trends of 

S 2 and L2 (Fig. 4.2). 

The sediments and the crystalline basement are divided into the cratonic, Simão 

Dias and Itabaiana domains. The deformed metasediments are divided into the regional, 

west and east domains (Fig. 4.2). 

The cratonic domain, comprises mostly the flat-lying Lagarto-Palmares 

Formation, but also encompasses deformed Jacaré metasiltites and Frei Paulo phylHtes. 

The Simão Dias domain consists of the Simão Dias gneisses which are affected by tight 

F2 folds, and by a WNW-ESE trending S2 foliation. 

The Itabaiana domain comprises the Itabaiana gneisses, which are affected by 

open-tight F2 folds associated with a normally S2 spaced cleavage. This domain shows a 

varied style of internal deformation according with the position in the Itabaiana dome 

(which is likely associated with the variable thickness of the Itabaiana quartzites). 

The regional domain comprises the metasediments outside of the Itabaiana dome, 

and is characterised by sub-parallel and steep dipping S1 and S2 foliations, by tight F2 
folds, and by a WNW-ESE trend for S2 and L 2 . The west and east domains are on the 

western and eastern borders of the Itabaiana quartzites surrounding the Itabaiana dome 

(Fig. 4.2). Both characteristically present a flat-lying S1 foliation affected by open to 

tight F2 folds associated with NNW-SSE trending S2 and L2. 

The stereographic plots of the D 1 -D 2 structures for each structural domain are 

shown in Figure 4.3 . 

4.3 - The D1 Deformation 
The F1 f o l d s are generally WNW-ESE trending, SSW verging, isoclinal and 

recumbent folds that affect S0 and Sn, and develop a strong axial planar foliation (S1) 

which cuts across the fold hinges (Figs. 4.4 A &amp;amp; B). These folds are generally rootless 

and commonly range from 10's of centimetres to 10's of metres, and may have their 

overturned limbs cut by subhorizontal thrusts (Fig. 4.4 C). 

S1 mostly trends WNW-ESE and commonly dips at high angles (90°-60° 

generally to the NNE, but also to the SSW) in the regional and Simão Dias domains, or 

at 60° to 50° in the Itabaiana domain. S1 is relatively flat-lying in the west and east 

domains (Fig. 4.3 A), where the range of attitudes is from 20°/318° to 60°/033°(west 

domain) and from 30°/046° to 15°/130° (east domain).

As a consequence of the recumbent F1 folding, S1 is generally nearly parallel to 

S0 and Sn. The statistical analysis of the poles to S 0 , Sn and S1 (Fig. 4.3 A) shows more 

or less complete II girdles defining great circles, but the maximum concentration of 

poles observed in the regional, Simão Dias and Itabaiana domains indicates a 44°-70° 

dip to NNE. This attitude is as a consequence of the vergence of the F2 folding 

(discussed in section 4.4 below). 

S1 is a foliation defined by a planar-parallel orientation of sericite (or muscovite), 
chlorite, locally biotite (Fig. 4.4 D) and very fine grained quartz, in phyllites, diamictites 
and metacarbonates, with addition of feldspars and epidote (transformed from 
hornblende) and trails of opaque minerals in the basement rocks. In the quartzites it 
mostly consists of sericite (or muscovite) and elongated quartz grains. 

Quartz and carbonate veins are injected sub-parallel to S, and are deformed by 
F2 folds. Syn-Dj quartz veins are common in the basement gneisses and in the phyllitic 
metasediments, whereas carbonate veins are common in the metacarbonate formations. 

The quartz-sericite-chlorite Frei Paulo phyllites, which are the dominant rock 
type in the west and east domains, have a pervasive layer-parallel fabric defined by sub-
millimetre layers of micro-crystalline quartz intercalated with&amp;lt;lmm-thick mica domains 
(sericite, chlorite and local biotite), and sub-parallel quartz veins, generally affected by 
the D2 structures (Fig. 4.4 E). 

A strong S1 foliation consisting of oriented flakes of sericite and opaque minerals 
is observed sub-parallel to the bedding of Frei Paulo sandy phyllites in the western part 
of the area (outcrops 848, 849, Fig. 3.1). 

L1 linear features are the fold axes (B1) and the intersection lineation (L1-0), 
which may be marked by oriented flakes of micaceous minerals, quartz ribbons, or 
quartz and feldspars. The amount of field information on D 1 linear structures collected in 
the area is insignificant for purposes of statistical analysis, but where these elements 
were observed (e.g. outcrops 31, 305, 311, 720, 1040, 1112, Fig. 3.1) they are nearly 
parallel to L2 linear features. 

4.4 - The D2 Deformation 

4.4.1- F3 folds and structural elements 

F2 f o l d s are open to isoclinal, gently inclined to upright, WNW-ESE trending, 
asymmetric with a SSW vergence. They are gently plunging folds that affect SI, So and 
Sn (Fig- 4.5). They co-axially refold the F1 folds, and range in size from micro 
crenulations to km-scale folds (observed in the aerial photographs) and are generally 
associated with a penetrative axial planar foliation (S2). 

The S2 foliation is mainly a pressure solution or a mineral foliation, and less 

commonly a slaty cleavage or a spaced cleavage. It generally dips at 60°-90° to NNE in 

the regional, Simão Dias and Itabaiana domains, and to NE in the west and east domains 
(Fig. 4.2 B).

Figure 4.5 - D2 folds in the metasediments (A) and in the gneissic basement (B) 
of the Itabaiana dome area. 



The pressure solution foliation is normally defined by iron and/or manganese 

oxide seams along sub-parallel surfaces and are best developed in tightly folded 

metacarbonates (Fig. 4.6 A), and in the phyllitic rocks. In some cases the pressure 

solution process appears to have evolved progressively from the development of 

crenulations (as in Fig. 4.4 E), resulting in sharp zones of concentration of iron oxides 

and very fine micaceous minerals, comparable to the discrete crenulation cleavage of 

Gray (1977). 

The mineral foliation is commonly marked by parallel, fine-grained sericite, 

chlorite and some biotite, which in the diamictites and gneisses are accompanied by very 

fine-grained quartz and feldspars. The slaty cleavage is more common in phyllitic rocks 

and interbedded phylliies and metasiltites (Fig. 4.6 B). 

L2 linear features are also penetrative and consist of the fold axis (B2), the 

intersection lineation (L1-2) and the elongation lineation (Ls) ,which are all parallel to 

each other and plunge, generally at low angles (08° to 16°) either to WNW or ESE, in 

the regional, Simão Dias and Itabaiana domains, and either to NNW or SSE in the west 

and east domains (Fig. 4.2 C). The double plunge of L2 can be observed in the walls of 

large outcrops (e.g. outcrop 90, to the SE of Paripiranga, Figure 3.1). The shift of the 

directions of L2 in the west and east domains, relative to the regional domain, confirms 

the change of the strike of S2 (compare Figs. 4.3 B &amp;amp; C). 

L1-2 is defined by the intersection of finely-spaced, mica-rich S2 planes with S1 
or S0, Sn (Fig. 4.7 A), or by a pencil-like lineation (Fig. 4.8 B). Mullion structures 

may locally occur in tightly folded metacarbonates. Ls is defined by flattened and 

elongated oolites and pellets in metacarbonates, by pyrite and fine-grained quartz in 

phyllites, and by pulled-apart grains of K-feldspar, plagioclase, and clasts of basement 

rocks in the diamictites and pebbly phyllites. In mylonitic quartzites Ls consists of 

ribbons of quartz and trains of deformed opaque minerals, and pressure shadow zones 

developed around K-feldspar and tourmaline clasts (Fig. 4.7 C). In the gneiss and 

basement derived mylonites, Ls consists of quartz ribbons, trains of elongated feldspars 

and aligned grains of epidote, or pulled-apart resistant grains such K-feldspars and 

hornblende (Fig. 4.7 D). 

A mineral lineation defined by hornblende and feldspars is locally observed on 

the limbs of open to very tight F2 folds affecting the basement gneisses. The lineation 

plunges at low to high angles to the north, but the few examples (outcrop 12, N of 

Simão Dias and outcrop 404, road Campo do Brito-Itabaiana, Fig. 3.1) do not allow to 

trace it across the area. It might be a relict of older deformations affecting the basement. 

Trains of l-10m scale F2 folds are a common feature, particularly in proximity to 

the regional faults, and normally show a sinistral asymmetry on the horizontal surfaces. 

4.4.2 - The regional faults 

Despite most of the regional faults having a clear signature defined on aerial 
photographs or maps of aeromagnetic anomalies (see section 5.4) they are not as 
obvious in the field. A locality with a typical brittle fault plane has not been found, nor 
described in the literature.

Nevertheless, the fault zones normally correspond to my Ionization and intense 
folding of the country rocks, and the penetrative foliation generally dips at high angles or 
sub-vertically to the NNE. The best outcrops of these rocks are along the roads cutting 
across the Simão Dias, Itaporanga and Dores faults (Fig. 3.1). 

The F2 folds outside and the folds inside the fault zones are comparable in all 
their characteristics. They show compatible mineral assemblages along the axial planar 
foliations, and similar orientation of the axial planes, axial planar foliations, fold axes, 
intersection lineations and mylonitic lineations. All these linear elements are nearly 
parallel and gently plunging (Fig. 4.8 A) to WNW or ESE. 

The Simão Dias fault is a&amp;lt;2km wide zone of imbricated steep-dipping slices 
of highly folded quartzite- and basement-derived mylonites and phyllonites, better 
exposed at the northern border of the Simão Dias dome (outcrops 19-20, 306-307 Fig 
3.1). 

Several kinematic indicators, such as S-C relationships (Berthe et al. 1979; Lister 

&amp;amp; Snoke 1984; Shimamoto 1989), porphyroblast-tail systems (Passchier &amp;amp; Simpson 

1986), and shear bands (Plat &amp;amp; Vissers 1980; Passchier 1984) all indicate top to the 

south, combined with E-W strike-slip movements (Fig. 4.8 B &amp;amp; D). 

At its eastern termination inside the Itabaiana Dome Area, the Simão Dias fault 

consists of a &amp;lt;lkm wide zone of sub-vertically imbricated slices of Itabaiana quartzites, 

Ribeiropolis phyllites and basement gneisses and derived mylonites. These are tightly to 

isoclinally folded and exhibit a strong pencil-like intersection lineation parallel to a 

mineral stretching lineation (as along the Lomba river and Montes stream, and on the 

Arrasudor farm - outcrops 888, 889, 916, 926 to 930, 933 and 934, Fig. 3.1). 

The Itaporanga fault is a&amp;lt;500m wide zone of mylonitic gneisses and 
mylonitic Olhos D'agua metacarbonates. Feldspar porphyroclast-tail systems and small-

scale sigmoidal porphyroclasts and slices of carbonate rocks observed on horizontal 

surfaces (nearly parallel to the XZ plane), in the mylonitic gneisses and mylonitic 

dolomites (outcrop 276, road Simão Dias to Lagarto) ail indicate a sinistral movement for 

this fault. This is confirmed by subvertical, sinistral shear bands affecting polydeformed 

metacarbonates elsewhere along the fault zone (Fig. 4.8 E). 

In the SW comer of the area (outcrop 839, Fig. 3.1), the Itaporanga fault 

separates sheared and silicified Lagarto-Palmares sandstones which dip 85° to 356°, and 

contains a striae lineation plunging 24° to 080°, from highly folded Olhos D'àgua 

metacarbonates. In a single, flat-lying outcrop at the same locality, a well-cemented and 

somewhat stratified breccia, containing generally 10cm size angular c lasts of deformed 

Olhos D'agua metalimestones is also found. 

The Dores fault zone is exposed in the road to the Volta Village in the NE 
corner of the area (outcrop 1105, Fig. 3.1). It places subvertical, highly sheared 
quartzites and basement-derived phyllonites on Frei Paulo phyllites and is also marked 
by percolation of manganese and iron oxides. Shear bands affecting the quartzites and 
the phyllonites respectively indicate a top to the south and a E-W sinistral strike-slip 
movement (the latter is shown in Fig. 4.8 F).

south of Símão Dias, and (F) is from the Dores fault, outcrop 1105 to the 
southwest of the Volta village. 



The E s c a r p a fault places tightly folded Frei Paulo variegated phyllites on 
tightly folded Olhos D'agua metacarbonates. This is best observed on the road from 

Simão Dias to Pinhão (outcrops 31-32), and along the secondary road from Olhos 

D'agua to the Vaza Barris river (outcrop 415, NE of Olhos D'agua, Fig. 3.1). 

The trace of the Pelada fault corresponds in the field to a zone of intense quartz 
veining (between Macambira and Pedra Mole), and to a localised zone of shearing in the 

Palestina diamictites (outcrop 113, in the western part of the area, Fig. 3.1). 

The Mocambo fault, as seen in the outcrops 1065 and 1066 of the Salgado 
river (Fig. 3.1, enclosure), consists of a&amp;lt;km wide zone of intensely foliated and 

brecciated Frei Paulo metasandstones ). The outcrops do not allow any determination of 

the sense of movement, but in this area the Mocambo fault controls the local E-W trend 

of the Salgado river and a secondary drainage (as observed on aerial photographs). 

The Vaza Barris, Mocambo and Montes strike-slip faults, and the 
faults displacing the eastern-southern border of the Itabaiana dome, are also observed on 

the aerial photographs, and some can also be seen in the field. For example, sheared 

diamictites with clear indication of dextral movement are observed in the Vaza Barris 

fault zone (outcrop 1078, northwestern part of the area, Fig. 3.1). 

It is noteworthy to mention that in the aerial photographs the dextral displacement 

along the Vaza Barris fault and Mocambo shear dies along their traces and vanishes 

parallel to the regional foliation towards the Itabaiana dome. The southeastern end of the 

Vaza Barris fault coincides with a broad area of intense quartz veining (Fig. 3.1). 

The Jacaré fault is the most prominent of several NW-SE to WNW-ESE 
trending lineaments observed in aerial photographs and topographic maps within and 

outside the southern mapped area. The fault trace roughly corresponds to a topographic 

break between 600m high hills to the south from 400m high hills to die north of it, as 

observed in the 1:100,000 topographic maps used as basis for the geological mapping. 

These hills are formed by the Lagarto-Palmares sandstones, which are intensely 

fractured, silicified and indurated (outcrops 78 and 957, southwestern part of the area, 

Fig. 3.1). The Jacaré fault is interpreted as a normal fault with uncertain age relative to 

the other regional faults. 

4.4.3 - D2 deformation fabrics 

Commonly in rocks that contain elements with different competences, e.g. 
diamictites with coarse-grained clasts in a fine-grained matrix, or even in mylonitic 
gneisses (Fig. 4.9), the competent grains, clasts, or porphyroclasts are typically 
fractured, pulled-apart and rotated, in order to accommodate the more ductile 
deformation of the matrix. Pressure shadows and tails are also commonly developed 
around rigid elements in a more ductile matrix. 

The fractures in the grains are filled by veins of fibrous quartz or calcite, or 
fibrous overgrowth of chlorite and sericite (Figs. 4.9 A &amp;amp; B). The low pressure tails 
developed around the coarse-grained rigid particles normally consist of dynamically 
recrystallised quartz and feldspar, and very fine sericite, chlorite and minor biotite (Fig. 
4.9 C).

The micaceous minerals in the tails and voids are coarser than those along the 
foliation planes. In thin section from one locality within the Simâo Dias gneiss (outcrop 
101, WSW of Simão Dias, Fig. 3.1) needles of actinolite infill the fractures in pulled-
apart fragments of hornblende. 

4.4.4 - Strain analyses 

The deformed clasts and respective tails in the Palestina diamictites and pebbly 
phyllites generally form ellipses which are observable in many subhorizontal and 
subvertical surfaces nearly parallel to the XZ, XY and YZ planes in the outcrops (Fig. 
4.10) and in the oriented thin sections (Fig. 4.11). 

A qualitative observation of hundreds of such ellipses in the field and in thin 
sections (Figs. 4.10 A-B &amp;amp; 4.11) is sufficient to reveal that the X-parallel axis, which 
lies parallel to F2 fold axis and L1 - 2, is generally much longer than the Y-parallel axis. 

However, particularly in the core of the Paripiranga anticline, or in the hinge 
zones of larger F2 folds (outcrops 90, 239 and 299, Fig. 3.1), and in outcrops located 
closer to the western margin of the Itabaiana dome (e.g. outcrop 987) the clasts are 
generally undeformed, or even rounded without any tail in the YZ plane (Figs. 4.10 C &amp;amp; 
D), even though they are very elongated in the X direction. 

An extensive quantification of the strain recorded by the clasts in the Palestina 
Formation was carried out throughout the area, by measuring the axis of the clasts in 
outcrops or in oriented thin sections. These data (Appendices A2.1-A2.3) were treated 
according to different methods of strain quantification (Flinn 1962, 1965; Hsu 1966; 
Lisle 1979; Borradaile 1981). The measurements were carried out on clasts of milky 
quartz, granite, gneiss, and grains of feldspar, which are the majority in outcrops and 
thin sections. This is an attempt to avoid extreme contrast of ductility if clasts of 
metasediments were also studied. 

Clasts were measured directly on surfaces nearly parallel to the XY and YZ 
planes, in the outcrops 36, 90, 107 and 108 (Appendix A2.1). These data allowed direct 
calculation of the X/Y and Y/Z axial ratios. The strain ellipsoids calculated using the 
maximum and minimum ratios for each surface are plotted on Flinn's and Hsu's 
diagrams (Figs.4.12 A &amp;amp; B). In both the diagrams, all the finite strain ellipsoids lie in 
the field of constriction or apparent constriction. 

As displayed in Figures 4.12 A &amp;amp; B, the strain ellipsoid calculated for outcrop 90 
has the most prolate of the four ellipsoids. Outcrop 90 lies in the protected core of a 
= lkm scale and open F2 fold and shows no intense S2 foliation (Fig. 3.18 C) compared 
to the other outcrops, which are characterised by tight folding and a pervasive S2 
foliation. 

In the outcrops 44, 107, 108 and 405 (Appendix A2.2) it was possible to 

measure also the parameters S and D of Borradaile (1981), respectively for the matrix 

and the clasts, in surfaces nearly parallel to the XZ and YZ planes. As defined by 

Borradaile (1981), the ratio (S-D)/D can be considered as the minimum amount of ductile 

deformation of the matrix relative to the clast, which is considered as a rigid panicle.

axial ratio in the thin section containing the stretching lineation (parallel to X in the XZ plane) than the ratio observed in the thin 
section perpendicular to it (YZ).

Ellipses defined by clasts and clasts+tails were also measured in thin sections cut 
parallel to the XZ and YZ planes of the Palestina pebbly phyllites in the outcrops 33,36, 
42, 84, 90, 111, 140, 142, 186, 188, 192, 193, 239, 246, 249, 341, 405 and 997 
(Appendix A2.3). 

The harmonic mean of the X/Z and Y/Z axial ratios were calculated for the data in 

Appendices A2.2 and A2.3 and are summarised in Table 4.2 . These means were also 

used for the computation of the parameters a, b and K of the strain ellipsoid (Flinn 1962, 

1965) of each outcrop (Table 4.2), whose plot in the Flinn's diagrams of Figures 4.12 C 

&amp;amp; D indicates both constrictional and flattening deformation. 

The graphic method of Fry (1979) was applied upon enlarged photographs of 

thin sections parallel to XZ and YZ planes in outcrops 186 and 188, which are 

characterised by development of intense S2 pressure foliation (Fig. 6.11). The ellipses 

defined by this method were parallel to the X or Y directions, and the computation of the 

a, b and K parameters from their axial ratios (Table 4.2) indicates strain dominated by 

flattening (K&lt;0) in areas of tight folding. These results are compatible with those from 

the analysis of the data for the same outcrops in the Appendix A2.3 (apart from the large 

discrepancy of values of K for outcrop 186). 

Thus, an average shape of cigar shaped ellipsoid with circular or slightly elliptical 

sections perpendicular to the long axis describes the clasts in the less D2-strained areas (a 

prolate geometry with X&gt;&gt;Y&gt;Z). In areas of more intense D2 deformation a cigar shape 

geometry whose circular basal section underwent flattening in the YZ plane (X Y&gt;Z) 

probably matches the average shape of the clasts of the Palestina Formation. 

Lisle (1979) discussed the difficulties of quantifying strain in polymict 

conglomeratic rocks with a marked competency contrast, and where there is practically 

no fluctuation (such is the case with the Palestina rocks). He proposed that in many 

cases the harmonic mean of the axial ratio of the clasts on each surface is a better 

approximation of the shape of the strain ellipse. 

These conclusions are valid for the clasts in the Itabaiana quartzites and 

Ribeirópolis pebbly phyllites on the western border of the Itabaiana dome (for example 

in outcrops 312, 470 and 471, Fig. 3.1), and also in the Olhos D'água Formation 

(outcrops 5, 7, 829 and 1061, all around Paripiranga). 

4.4.5 - Syn-D 2 vein systems 
In thin section, highly foliated phyllites, pebbly phyllites and metacarbonates 

show that quartz and calcite veins commonly cross-cut S 2 , and are also 

dissolved/shortened by the S2 pressure solution seams (Fig. 4.13 A). From samples of 

different localities (for example outcrops 84, 140, and 249, Fig. 3.1) it has been 

observed that the transversal veins are also affected by micro-scale F2 folds, or are 

disrupted, displaced and progressively rotated to positions sub-parallel to S2. 
The rotation of the vein segments, as well as the mineral grains or fragments, 

mostly occurs along, subvertical sinistral shear bands and shear fractures which trend at 

low angles to the S2 foliation (Fig. 4.13 B), and less commonly along subvertical dextral 

shear bands and shear fractures trending at high angles to the foliation.

This situation probably reflects a progressive sequence of D2 deformational 
events, which is also supported by other observations in the area, such as shear bands 
and shear fractures displacing tails and the material infilling the inter-grain low pressure 
voids (for example, in tfiin section of outcrop 140), 

4.4.6 - Inter-foliation slip away from the fault zones 
As well as being found along the regional faults, the S-N directed shortening 

associated with the D2 deformation was coupled with a component of inter-foliation slip 
along the WNW-ESE trending regional foliation, in the rocks at distance from the fault 
zones. 

This is documented by transverse fractures and asymmetric tails in the clasts of 
the diarnictites and pebbly phyllites, which systematically indicates a component of a top 
to the south, and another of a E-W sinistral movement along the steep dipping S2 
foliation (Fig. 4.14). 

Evidence of horizontal dextral movements along the foliation planes of the rocks 

away from the fault zones are much more localised, although they are found both in thin 

sections and in outcrops. The examples occur on the Comandante farm, and mainly in 

the Simâo Dias gneisses (Fig. 3.1, enclosure), particularly along the borders of the 

Itaporanga and Simão Dias faults. 

On the Comandante farm, a series of NW-SE trending, generally subvertical 

shear zones defined by silicification, induration, and quartz veining of the the Jacaré 

metasiltites and fine sandstones, together with drag-folding of a steep dipping bedding 

sub-parallel penetrative foliation. In the Simão Dias gneiss (and less commonly in the 

Itabaiana gneisses), the dextral movements are indicated by 10-100cm wide, subvertical 

ductile and brittle-ductile shear bands and shear zones affecting gneisses, mylonites and 

phyllonites {Fig. 4.15). 

4.5 - The D3 Deformation 
This is a non-penetrative event indicated by 10cm- to l0m-scale, NE-SW 

trending, generally open and upright, kink-style F3 folds, 1mm-10cm size crenulations 

and kink bands affecting the S2 foliation and the older planar elements (Fig. 4.16). 

The mesoscopic F3 folds are normally associated with a spaced cleavage axial 

planar foliation (S3). The average trend of the axial plane of the F3 folds (PA3) and the 

S3 foliation is NE-SW in all the structural domains, and the dip normally ranges between 

60° and 90°, to the NW or to the SE (Fig. 4.17 A). 

Even in the areas where the F3 folds are absent, S3 is marked set of closely 

spaced, SW-NE trending, steep dipping to subvertical partition planes (Fig. 4.17 A) 

which may be marked by pressure solution seams (e.g. outcrops 880-890, along the 

Lomba river, Fig. 3.1). This set cross-cuts the S2//S1 foliations and defines the pencil-

like L1-2 intersection lineation (e.g. Fig. 4.7 B). Finely spaced, subvertical and 

undeformed, and generally lcm thick quartz or carbonate veins are commonly found 

emplaced along these planes, particularly in phyllites, phyllonites and metacarbonates.

Figure 4.19 - Late-stage, post D3 deformation in the Itabaiana dome area. 



Detailed analysis of the aerial photographs has also revealed a regional set of 
fractures spaced at a km-scale and trending SW-NE, parallel with the S3 orientation. 
These fractures cross-cut the WNW-ESE trending structural grain of the area, and 
partially control the drainage pattern in both the metasediments and crystalline basement, 

L3 linear features are the F3 fold axis (B3) and the intersection lineation (L3^2) 
which plunge gently to sub-vertically generally to the NE or to the SW (Fig. 4.17 B). 
The dispersion of L3 linear features reflects the scattering of the contour of maximum 
concentration of points from NNW to E. 

The F3 folds and kinks are better developed in highly anisotropic lithologies, 
such as phyllitic matrix metasediments, thin horizons of metapelites within 
metacarbonates, and basement-derived mylonites and phyllonites. 

The best examples are found in those areas where S2&gt; S0 (or S n) and S j are all 
subvertical, probably because of the Fj and F2 structural repetition of layers of 
contrasting competence with sub-parallel foliation planes certainly provided many 
slippery surfaces parallel to the regional anysotropy. In such areas, the transverse F3 
folds deform the co-axial interference pattern developed by the Fj and F2 folds (type 3 of 
Ramsay 1967), as shown in Figures 4.4 B &amp;amp; 4.18. 

Isolated, very broad to open style F3 folds refold the F 1 F 2 co-axial pattern, in 
areas where probably a relatively small amount of inter-foliation slip nucleated along the 
subvertical S2//ST surfaces (as is likely the case in Fig. 4.4 B). In areas where 
comparatively larger amounts of inter-foliation slip developed, trains of tighter F3 folds 
may occur associated with local strike-slip faults (Fig. 4.18 D). 

Late-stage shearing and thrusting 
In some localities, the subvertical S2 and S3 foliations are affected by low-angle, 

NNE dipping, discrete thrust-fault planes or local shear zones (Fig. 4.19) which may be 
accompanied by sets of sigmoidal tension fractures and rotated quartz veins. A top to 
SSW movement is indicated on these structures. 

4.6 - The structural domains 
Despite the polyphase deformation, the vertical cross-sections (AB, CD and EF 

of Fig. 4.20, enclosure) show a structural pattern dominated by south vergent F2 folds 
and high-angle thrust faults. The structural facing defined by small-scale F2 folds and the 
S2/S1, relationships suggest that large-scale and overturned F2 folds occur in the area. 

In the Itabaiana Dome Area cross-section balancing techniques, as used in the 
frontal parts of foreland fold and thrust belts (Dahlstrom 1969; Hossack 1979; 
Woodward et al. 1985) are difficult to apply, because of the penetrative ductile 
deformation that the area has undergone, together with the lack of an undeformed 
stratigraphic column with which to construct an undeformed template for the restored 
section. 

Non-balanced cross sections and more artistic interpretations are valid in these 
areas, particularly if they also show orogen-parallel tectonic transport (Woodward et al. 

116 



1985 ) and pervasive ductile deformation (Cooper &amp;amp; Trayner 1986) as is the case in the 
Itabaiana Dome Area. 

However, although no attempts of line or area balancing have been done, the 
structural cross-sections AB, CD and EF show a correspondence between the depth of 
metasediments and the basement which is in accordance with the interpretations of the 
gravimetric and aeromagnetic data (see section 5.5). 

The variations in the style of the F2 folds and in the intensity of the D2 
deformation, together with the variable attitude of the D j - D 2 structural elements across 
the area, are the basis for the characterisation of the different structural domains (sections 
4.3 &amp;amp; 4.4). 

4.6.1 - The cratonic domain 

The sediments in the southernmost part of the largely unmetamorphosed cratonic 
domain, and are only affected by broad NW to WNW trending folds, which are 
observed in aerial photographs and revealed by the changing dips of the relatively flat 
lying Lagarto-Palmares sandstones. 

A gradual increase in the intensity of the S2 foliation is observed in many parts of 
the southern area: the foliation starts in the south as locally observed micro crenulations 
imprinted on mudstones of the Lagarto-Palmares Formation and passes into well defined 
cleavage planes in the Jacaré metasiltites and into a micaceous foliation in Frei Paulo 
phyllites, towards the trace of the Itaporanga fault. 

4.6.2 - The regional and Simão Dias domains 
Apart from the open style of the Paripiranga anticline (Fig. 4.19 A), these 

domains are characterised by generally very tight to isoclinal F2 folds with axial planes 

generally dipping 60° to NNE. 

The high amplitude/wavelength ratios generally observed in the F2 folds, which 
commonly display overthickened hinges transposed by S2 (Fig. 4.6 A) indicates a 
significant amount of flattening in these folds. The intense shortening results in a nearly 
subvertical layered sequence formed by planes of S 0 , Sn, S, and S2 planes. Thus, it is 
generally not easy to distinguish S1 from S2 in the field. 

However, various examples of 1-10cm-scale, co-axially refolded Ft folds are 
found (Fig, 4.4 A), and there is also evidence of Si folded in the hinge zones of 
mesoscopic F2 folds (e.g. outcrop 45, road Simão Dias to Pinhão, Fig. 3.1). In 
addition, a strong bed-parallel sericitic foliation (S 1) is well documented in the flat-lying 
Frei Paulo sandy phyllites folded by the Paripiranga anticline to the WSW of Paripiranga 
(outcrop 848, Fig. 3.1). 

With the above characteristics, it does not seem to be a coincidence that in the 
regional domain the clasts of the Palestina diamictites are more flatenned in the YZ plane 
than they are elsewhere. Also this domain is the lonely with evidence of the late-stage, 
subhorizontal thrusts and shears described in the previous section. 

Finally it is noteworthy to mention that the frequency of Sr and S2- parallel 
quartz veins increases toward the northern border of the area, as observed in the 

117

Palestina diamictites in all sections across the Vaza Barris river valley, and also within the 
Ribeirópolis and Frei Paulo phyllites of the northern part of the area, which matrix is 
coarse-grained in places than the phyllitic rocks to the west, east and south of the 
Itabaiana dome (e.g. outcrops 528, 700, 701, and 1101, Fig. 3.1). 

4.6.3 - The Itabaiana domain 
The F2 folds within the Itabaiana gneisses are generally more open than those in 

the regional and Simão Dias domains, and as a consequence S2 normally cuts Sn//S1, at 
higher angles (confirmed by the statistical analysis, Fig. 4.3 B). Rootless and generally 
recumbent F1 folds are found in some places, mostly on the limb of the F2 folds. The 
SN//S1 surfaces are also affected by gentle to open, 100-l000m-scale F 3 folds observed 
in road cuts, dams and quarries. 

The superposition of open F2 and F3 folds with orthogonal axes and vertical 
axial planes explains the scatter plot of Sn//S1 with a maximum concentration near the 
centre of the diagram (Figs. 4.3 A &amp;amp; B). This also explains the relative dispersion of 
L2/B2 between 270°-320° and 090°-140° (Fig. 4.3 C). 

A detailed study of the structures across the Itabaiana domain (Fig. 4.21 B), has 
revealed important differences in the structural styles and deformational patterns in the 
gneisses and in the Itabaiana quartzites on each part of the Itabaiana dome, as 
summarised in Figures 4.21 C-E &amp;amp; 4.22. 

At the northern border of the dome the Itabaiana quartzites are affected by m-
scale, overturned, isoclinal, and SSW verging F2 folds (Fig.4. 21 C), and contain a 
layer-parallel mylonitic foliation with evidence of subhorizontal shear bands indicating a 
top to the south movement (Fig. 4.21 E). These folds are also observed within mylonitic 
quartzites and gneisses approaching the southern border (Figs. 4.22 A &amp;amp; B). In this 
area, Humphrey &amp;amp; Allard (1969) described imbricated slices of quartzites and crystalline 
basement (to the NNW of Macambira). 

The southern limb of the Itabaiana dome comprises mylonitic gneisses and 
quartzites folded by Z asymmetry small-scale F2 folds in cross sections (Fig. 4.21 D) 
and this relationship is confirmed by the shallower dip of the S2 foliation cutting the 
steep-dipping to subvertical mylonitic foliation (Figs. 4.22 C &amp;amp; D). 

It can be concluded that the Itabaiana dome very probably lies in the core of a 
large-scale, southward verging F2 anticline, whose overturned steep-dipping southern 
limb is cut by high-angle thrusts in the area between the Itaporanga and Simão Dias 
faults (Fig. 4.21 C). These faults are likely responsible for the imbrication of subvertical 
slices of mylonitic Itabaiana quartzites, Ribeirópolis phyllites and basement-derived 
mylonites of the Lomba river, Montes stream and Arrastador farm (Fig. 3.1, enclosure). 

The 700m-thick Itabaiana quartzites are only slightly deformed in the eastern 
and western parts of the dome, where different styles of deformation are observed. In 
the eastern part of the dome, the gneisses and the quartzites are mainly cross-cut by the 
subvertical and localised strike-slip faults (Fig. 4.1) whereas in the western pan of the 
dome, the quartzites are folded by the large-scale F2 anticlines and synclines in the Miaba 
range (Fig. 4.1).

Figure 4.22 - Structural relationships in the southern part of the Itabaiana dome. 



The structural relationships in the northern and southern borders of the Itabaiana 

dome support the interpretation of an overturned F2 anticline for the Simão Dias dome 

(Fig. 4.21 A). In fact, as in the northern margin of the Itabaiana dome, the northern 

border of the Simão Dias dome comprises imbricated slices of tightly folded quartzite-

and gneiss-derived mylonites (e.g. of outcrops 26, 306, 307, 1106, 1108, 1109, Fig. 

3.1), with vergence towards the south. 

4.6.4 - The west and east domains 

These domains are mainly characterised by the differential intensity of the D2 
deformation in the succession of the metasediments, and by a nearly 25° clockwise 

rotation of the directions of D2 structural elements (compare the plot of these structures 

with the other domains, Figs. 4.3 B &amp;amp; C). 

All the formations above the thick quartzites show a pervasive and flat-lying S 1 
foliation, which dips respectively to NW and SE in the west and east domains (Fig. 4.2 
A). However, the F2 folding is rather important in the Frei Paulo and Palestina 
Formations, whereas the Jacoca Formation commonly show D1 structures relatively 
unaffected by D 2 . Within the west domain, this pattern of deformation is better observed 
nearer the thick Itabaiana quartzites of the Miaba range, in the Capitão farm outcrop (see 
section 4.7). 

The west and east domains are also relatively free of evidence for the D3 

deformation, but some structures compatible with this event in the west domain deserve 

special attention, in two localities of the Itabaiana-Ribeirópolis interface. 

In one place (outcrop 338, WNW of Macambira, Fig. 3.1), the Ribeirópolis 

phyllites are affected by NNE trending, asymmetric, ESE verging, lm-scale folds. The 

location is very close to the probable contact with the Itabaiana Formation. The fold axis 

plunges 05° to directions between 200°-237° and there is also a subtle lineation (18° to 

317°) defined by elongated&amp;lt;lmm size grains of opaque minerals. 

In the Miaba range (outcrop 471, Flecheira farm, Fig. 3.1), the Ribeirópolis 

pebbly phyllites rest on Itabaiana conglomeratic quartzites with an intense layer-parallel 

foliation (Fig. 4.23 A) parallel to the sheared contact. This contains fragments of 

quartzite and dips at 20° to 260° (Fig. 4.23 B). 

The Itabaiana quartzites are affected by two sets of spaced cleavage (respectively 

dipping 75° to 121°, and 85° to 035°), and the pebbly phyllites are cut by a foliation 

dipping 40° to 250°. The drag of this foliation approaching the shear zone, and the

4.7 - The Capitão farm outcrop 
This outcrop (Fig. 4.24) is the largest and most important in the research area 

and lies in the west domain, in the junction between the Salgado and Vaza Barris rivers 
(outcrop 311, Fig. 3.1). 

The outcrop is characterised by a series of mesoscopic recumbent folds 
associated with subhorizontal thrusts and possible local duplexes that affect the Jacoca 
carbonates just above the basal Ribeirópolis conglomerates, and by a series of small-
scale structural relationships (Figs. 4.24 A-F &amp;amp; details 1-8). Figures 4.24 A &amp;amp; B are 
respectively based on photo line drawing and on a 1:100 scale geological map of the 
bottom of the outcrop. The sketched details 1-4 are documented by the photographs of 
Figures 4.24 C-F. 

In this outcrop, a layer-parallel foliation (S1) is associated with small-scale, 
recumbent folds that affect metachert horizons inside dolomitic layers intercalated with 
dark grey phyllites (details 1-2). The Si foliation cuts the phyllitic layers at higher angle 
than in the dolomitic layers (Figs. 4.24 C &amp;amp; D), and it is also affected within those layers 
by generally open folds which locally evolve to kink-style, tight and asymmetric folds, 
with a horizontal axial planar foliation (details 2-3 and Fig. 4.24 E). Many carbonate 
veins emplaced within the phyllites, and parallel to S1 (detail 4 &amp;amp; Fig. 4.24 F), occur 
boudinaged, disrupted, pulled-apart or folded elsewhere along the same phyllitic layers 
(detail 5). 

Together, these structures suggest a progressive event of layer-parallel shearing 
(D1), responsible for the simultaneous development of extensional and compressional 
features which were subsequently rotated and deformed, as sketched in detail 6. 

Some small-scale back-folds, box folds, and low-high angle back-thrusts locally 
observed in that outcrop also fit in such a progressive layer-parallel shearing, but with a 
component of backward displacement, probably due to impossibilities for the thrust 
sheets to move further to the south. These structures also occur in the flat-lying Jacoca 
carbonates of the east domain, which equally show strong evidence of inter-layer 
shearing superimposed on a layer-parallel S1 foliation, and back folding associated with 
subhorizontal thrusting in small-scale (e.g outcrop 1051, Moças stream, Fig. 3.1). 

In the Capitão farm outcrop, the basal formations are also affected by isoclinal 
and overturned folds developed in the hanging wall of steep dipping normal faults (Figs. 
4.24 A &amp;amp; B) which appear to merge along a subhorizontal detachment (the competent 
layers are boudinaged along the locally sheared Ribeirópolis-Jacoca contact), resembling 
a listric extensional geometry. 

Davison &amp;amp; Santos (1989) interpreted the subhorizontal thrusts as a post-
extensional feature, attributing the lack of inversion along the normal faults to the 
difficulty of the thrusts to overcome their steep dip. It is interpreted here that the is D1 
extension is post-D1 subhorizontal thrusting. This interpretation is supported by: (a) 
megaboudins of the Jacoca dolomites occur several meters one from each other, along 
the basal contact, indicating no recovering of the extension even along the low-angle 
detachment, not only along the steeply dipping ramps; (b) one of the boudins is 
internally folded, which is better explained if the folding happened before the extension.

The folds in the hanging wall of the normal faults have overthickened hinges, 
have overturned limbs associated with reverse faults, have a curved axial planar foliation 
which mimics the listric plane of the normal fault, (Fig. 4.24 B) and the fold limb nearest 
the fault is extremely thinned and locally faulted in more brittle conditions (detail 7). 
They are here interpreted as the accommodation required to solve the space-problem 
caused by the downward movement of the hanging wall in listric extensional systems 
(Wernick &amp;amp; Burchfiel 1982; Gibbs 1984). 

Contractional structures commonly found in the hanging wall of extensional fault 
systems have been atributed to local stress fields due to the rotation of blocks above the 
crest of a ramp-flat basal detachment (Brumbaugh 1984; McClay &amp;amp; Ellis 1987), or even 
atributed solely to a velocity discontinuity between extending blocks (Brumbaugh 1984). 

However, as the outcrop shows no evidence of several, rotated blocks separated 
by high-angle faults, it is proposed here that the accommodation took place by a 
combination of folding and reverse faulting under ductile and ductile-brittle conditions, 
associated with the extreme difference of thicknesses and competence of layers. To 
accommodate the down throw of the matter along the steep dipping normal fault 
developed in the competent Ribeirópolis conglomerates, the thinly interlayered 
dolomites, metachert and phyllites probably acted more ductilely than two layers of more 
massive dolomites of the basal Jacoca Formation. 

The basal dolomitic layer was boudinaged along the sheared contact with the 
conglomerates (detail 8), whereas the thinly interlayered dolomites above the steep 
dipping normal fault were ductilely deformed in a roll-over syncline-anticline pair, so 
that the matter migrated from the limbs to the hinge of the folds, in a way similar to the 
convergent bed-parallel shearing described by Higgs et al. (1991) for such situations. 

The overlying massive dolomites initially accommodated the folding of the thinly 
interlayered sequence. With the continued extension, the progressive thinning of the limb 
of the fold nearer to the fault was brittly faulted (detail 7) and the progressive tightening 
and overturning of the syncline-anticline pair led to more thickening of the hinge. The 
reverse fault started to propagate in the overturned limb of the fold pair within the 
massive dolomites, probably because the more competent duplicated layer could not 
accommodate the final stage of tightening of the fold. 

The set of closely spaced and steep-dipping fractures which cuts the laminated 
rocks and the layer-parallel S1 foliation, just in the area above the horizontal extension of 
the dolomites and conglomerates (left side, Fig. 4.24 B)f is interpreted as a local 
accommodation to the extension, even though the fractures show orientations compatible 
with S2 in other parts of the area. 

4.8 - Metamorphism in the Itabaiana Dome Area 
Metamorphic conditions in the Itabaiana Dome Area are indicated by seriate, 

chlorite, biotite found normally along with the S1, and S2 regional foliations, together 

with quartz and feldspars (Fig. 4.4 D). Epidote occurs as a transformation of hornblende 

in the basement rocks and derived mylonites (section 3.3.1). 

128 



Sericite, Chlorite and biotite (and locally actinolite, section 4.4.3) are also found 
as fibrous overgrowths along the pressure shadow tails and voids associated with the 
deformed clasts and porphyroclasts observed in metasediments and in basement rocks 
and derived mylonites (Figs. 4.9 A &amp;amp; C). 

The data may even suggest a direct timing relationship between metamorphism 

and D1 and D2 deformational events. However, as porphyroblast-matrix relationships 

are absent in the Itabaiana Dome Area, nor they have been described elsewhere in the 

southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt, it can only be suggested, on the basis of the 

mineral assemblages and textural relationships above, that the metamorphism generally 

ranges from sub- to greenschist conditions, and that the basement underwent 

metamorphism at higher temperatures than the metasediments. 

In fact, Essene (1989) states that if the temperatures of the greenschist facies 

normally range within 300°-450°C, the presence of hornblende-epidote paragenesis 

implies the extension of the upper limit of this facies to 450°-550°C. 

Actually, the similar deformational processes observed in the resistant grains of 
the diamictites, pebbly phyllites and mylonites (section 4.4.3), which are attributed in the 
general literature to processes like fracturing and cataclasis, frictional sliding, diffusive 
mass transfer and crystal plasticity (McClay 1977; Knipe 1989), together with the ductile 
deformation of the highly strained quart grains, have all been interpreted as compatible 
with greenschist, up to low amphibolite metamorphism in other deformed areas 
(Simpson 1985; Carl et al. 1991). 

The higher frequency of syn-D2 and syn-D3 quartz veins, and the increased 
grain size of the micaceous minerals, observed toward the northern part of the area 
(section 4.6.2) suggest that probably there was also a slightly positive gradient of 
temperatures of the metamorphism, northward from the cratonic domain. 

4.9 - Discussion and conclusions 

The results of the structural analysis in the Itabaiana Dome Area indicate that the 
southern part of Sergipano Fold Belt underwent a polyphase, ductile to ductile-brittle 
progressive deformation (D r D 3 ) responsible for the SSW directed tectonic transport of 
the rocks toward the São Francisco Craton. 

Basement and cover were involved in the F2 folding and thrusting and also in the 
D3 deformation. On the basis of the strong coincidence of styles and similar orientation 
of each of the F1, F2 and F3 folding events, on the similar orientation of D , , D2 and D3 
structural elements, and similar ductile D1 deformation under greenschist facies, it is 
interpreted that the basement was also reworked during D1. 

The D j deformation can be interpreted as a progressive event of layer-parallel 
shearing and shortening which developed the pervasive S1 foliation, shearing of the 
basement-cover, rootless intra-folial F1 folds, and low-angle thrust faulting. The best 
expression of these structures are found in the Capitão farm outcrop (Fig. 4.24), but 
there is other evidence outside the Itabaiana Dome Area. 

129 



For example, Santos et al. (1988) described recumbent folds coaxially folded by 
F2 folds, in a large outcrop just beyond the northwestern corner of this thesis area, and 
Jardim de Sá et al. (1986) described F| recumbent folds and subhorizontal thrusting, 25 
km inside the craton, in the Patamute area (west of the Tucano basin, Fig. 2.3). 

D2 deformation records a progressive shortening by nearly upright folding and 
high-angle, southward vergent thrusting, with a component of orogen-parallel strike-slip 
movement, probably under a sinistral transpressive regime. The regional faults are 
interpreted to be the zones of strain concentration in the D2 progressive shortening and 
wrenching. The displacement along most of these faults combines a top to the south with 
a E-W sinistral strike-slip movement, D3 is interpreted as a non penetrative event of 
transversal shortening and extension. 

These interpretations are supported by several features which match with 
descriptions of other deformed belts which show a combination of shortening and 
wrenching strains, such as the parallelism of fold axes and stretching lineations, both 
perpendicular or at high-angle with the direction of tectonic transport (Lagarde &amp;amp; 
Michard 1986; Ridley 1986; Ellis &amp;amp; Watkinson 1987), together with the interfoliation 
slip along strike and dip of the axial plane foliation of the regional folds (Ghosh 1982). 

The deformation patterns, as revealed by the abundant strain markers, indicate 
these movements along the regional faults and also within metasediments away from the 
fault zones, comparing well with deformation predominantly by simple shear (e.g. 
Vauchez et al. 1987). 

The mutual cross-cutting relationships between S2 and the quartz and carbonate 
veins, which are folded, disrupted and rotated by extensional shear bands nearly parallel 
to S2, are commonly found in polydeformed areas, and are normally interpreted as die 
result of strain hardening after the development of a highly anisotropic sequence, 
indicative of a progressive deformation (Piatt &amp;amp; Vissers 1980). In such cases, the veins 
probably represent events of orogen-parallel extension and orogen-parallel slip, a typical 
feature of strike-slip regimes (Jamison 1991).They are emplacedin the final stages of the 
ductile deformation, before the deformation enters into the brittle field (Paschier 1984). 

Because D2 shortening and the top to the south shearing probably occurred at 
various intensities along strike, most of the F2 folds should have curved hinges at a 
regional scale (non-cylindrical folds of Williams &amp;amp; Chapman 1979). This may account 
for the double plunge of L2 described both in the Itabaiana Dome Area (Fig. 4.3) and to 
the west of the Tucano basin (e.g. Jardim de Sá et al. 1986; Moraes et al. 1987). A 
degree of differential slip along the strike of S2, S v S0 and S n , may also account for the 
fan of directions indicated by the plunge of L3 throughout the area (Fig. 4.17). 

The overall prolate geometry of the deformed strain markers in the Itabaiana 
Dome area suggests a constrictional strain parallel to the orogen, superimposed by a 
component of flattening during D 2 . However, as part of the finite strain is most probably 
due to D1? not all the elongation parallel to the orogen can be taken as evidence of D 2 -
related strike-slip displacement. 

The micro structures and the deformational processes observed in the diamictites, 

pebbly phyllites and basement-derived mylonites are very similar in the Itabaiana Dome 

130 



Area, suggesting equivalent mechanical behaviour during the deformation. 
Nevertherless, the precise determination of the bulk or the average strain in the research 
area is made difficult by factors inherent to the Palestina rocks. For example the very fine 
matrix contrasts with the size of the clasts, which in turn are composed derived from 
varied lithologies (Ramsay 1967; Hossack 1968; Lisle 1979; Ramsay &amp;amp; Huber 1987). 
Ramsay (1967) showed that the final shape of a deformed clast is largely dependent of 
its original orientation relative to the finite strain ellipsoid (the Rf/ø method), but Lisle 
(1979) does not recommend the application of the Rf/ø technique in cases where the 
angle of fluctuation is small or even absent, as is the case in the Ttabaiana Dome Area. 

Despite the above uncertainties, Borradaile (1981) predicted that for rocks with a 
large ductility contrast, the clasts probably become parallel to the direction of maximum 
extension, at only small values of the finite strain. The differences between the K values 
of the finite strain ellipsoid for the same outcrop (compare outcrops 90 and 107, Fig. 
4.12 A &amp;amp; Table 4.2) may be attributed to angular errors in assuming that the 
measurement plane is the XZ plane of the finite strain ellipsoid, as well as to the orders 
of magnitude difference in sizes between clasts in outcrops and clasts in thin section. 

In the Itabaiana Dome Area some strain has been absorbed by the ductile 
elongation of clasts, but also the harmonic means of (S-D)/D (Appendix A2.3) indicate 
superimposition of approximately 65% of shortening of the matrix around the clasts. 
This highlights the importance of flattening during the D2 deformation in the Itabaiana 
Dome Area, particularly where the F2 folds are tight to isoclinal. 

This conclusion is confirmed by the larger values of K calculated for the finite 
strain ellipsoids of clasts+tail as compared with the K values for clasts alone (Table 4.2; 
Figs. 4.12 C &amp;amp; D). The increase in the X and Y axes of the ellipsoids reflects the 
importance of pressure solution processes associated with the S2 foliation. As a result of 
flattening of the matrix together with the elongation of the clasts, the D2 deformation 
developed an intense L to L-S tectonite fabric in the Itabaiana Dome Area. 

As a result of the heterogeneous distribution of lithologies together with the 
styles and intensity of deformation and metamorphism, six structural domains have been 
recognised in the Itabaiana Dome Area. These are - the cratonic, regional, west and east 
domains - all formed by sediments and their deformed and metamorphosed counterparts, 
and the Simão Dias and Itabaiana domains, which comprise the ductilely reworked 
gneissic basement. 

A sub- to greenschist metamorphism is recorded from the cratonic to the regional 
domains, but the gneissic domains probably underwent higher temperature deformation 
at the same facies, as recorded by the hornblende-epidote paragenesis along the 
metamorphic banding (Sn) and along the S1 foliation. 

The results of this detailed structural analysis of the Itabaiana Dome Area place 
constraints on the tectonic evolution of the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt in 
that explanations are required for -

1 - The coincidence between the stretching lineation in the mylonites and the L2 
linear elements throughout the area. 

2 - The characteristics of the structural domains, in particular those of the 

131 



Itabaiana dome, e.g - The contact and the deformation relationships in different sides of 
the Itabaiana dome; - The shift of the trend of the D1-D2 structural elements around the 
dome; and the role of the dome itself and the thick Itabaiana quartzites in the deformation 
of the area. 

These aspects are addressed in the discussion in Chapter 6.

Chapter 5 - Geophysics of the Itabaiana Dome Area 

5.1 - Introduction 
This chapter presents new gravity and magnetic data collected specifically for this 

thesis, and is the first analysis of the nature of the crust in the southern part of the 
Sergipano Fold Belt. Previously published aeromagnetic and radiometric data are also 
used in combination with the new data. 

All the data were processed and analysed in the laboratories of the CPRM 
(Companhia de Pesquisas de Recursos Minerais, Salvador, Brazil), by Dr. A.C. Motta. 
The results, which form the basis of this chapter, have been presented in an unpublished 
report by Motta (1990) but the correlations between the geology and geophysics are 
responsibility of the author. 

This chapter contains 8 figures (Figs. 5.1-5.8), one table (Table 5.1), and an 
appendix with the data used for the construction of the geophysical cross section 
(Appendices A3.1-A3.4). 

5.2 - Summary of the geophysical and density data of the Itabaiana Dome 
Area 

5.2.1 - Geophysical data 
In order to analyse the nature of the upper crust of the southern part of the 

Sergipano Fold Belt, gravity and magnetic data were collected in the Itabaiana Dome 
Area, along three section lines, labelled XX', YY' and ZZ' in Figure 5.1. 

Sections XX' and YY' were chosen since they cut across the basement domes, in 
the same position of the cross sections AB and EF (Fig. 4.20, enclosure). Section ZZ' 
was chosen since it is a southern continuation of the NW-SE trending geophysical 
section carried out in the area of the Carira Project (Santos et al. 1988). This is 
designated Z'Z" in Figure 5.2, and the interpretation has already been shown in the 
Figure 2.8. 

Gravity and magnetic data were collected in the field using a Lacoste-Romberg 
gravimeter (accuracy of 0.01 mGal), and a Geometries magnetometer (Canada), model 
G-816 (year 1979; accuracy of 1 nT). 

The gravity survey was calibrated with a value of 978167.41mGals 
corresponding to the absolute value of the gravity field at the town of Itabaiana, in the 
Brazilian national gravity grid (Observatório Nacional, IBGE, according with Motta 
1990). The observed and calculated gravity data are shown in Appendices A3.1-A3.3 . 

The altitude of each field station was obtained by closed levelling traverses, and 
the geographic coordinates of each point were derived directly from the planialtimetric 
maps at 1:100,000 scale (the same as in the geological map, Fig. 3.1, enclosure). 

This chapter has also utilised aeromagnetic and radiometric data available for the 
southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt (Encal 1978). These are shown in the 

133 



Figure 5.2 - Grid of geographic coordinates with the location 
of the geophysical section lines in the area of this study (XX', 
YY' and ZZ') and the continuation of the ZZ' section line in the 
southeastern part of the area of the Carira Project (Z'Z").

in the 1:100,000 scale contour map of total radiometric values (Fig. 5.4). 

Because the aeromagnetic data of Figure 5.3 are already filtered and free of the 
influence of very shallow magnetic sources, unlike the magnetic data collected directly in 
the field (which show a wide variation over small distances), the ground magnetic data 
have not been utilised in the interpretation presented in this chapter. 

Motta (1990) chose to interpret the magnetic profiles along sections XX' and 
YY' by using the aeromagnetic data presented by Encal (1978). The observed and 
calculated anomaly data used for the aeromagnetic interpretation of sections XX', YY' 
and ZZ' are given in Appendices A3.1-A3.3 . 

Computer modelling of the geophysical data was carried out using programmes 
Geosoft Magpoly (2.1), and Geosoft Gravpoly (2.1), both by Patterson, Grant and 
Watson Ltd. 1984, (Canada). This software is officially used by the CPRM-Brazil for 
geophysical interpretations (Motta 1990). 

5.2.2 - Density data 
In order to permit quantitative interpretation of the gravity data, 85 samples of 

various rock types in the Itabaiana Dome Area were collected for density determinations. 

The results of the density determinations are presented in Appendix A3.4 and 
summarised in Table 5.1. The average density of 80 samples of all rock types is 2.62 

g/cm3. The average density of 52 samples of metasediment is 2.61 g/cm3, and the 

average density of 28 samples of crystalline basement rock is 2.64 g/cm3. 

The average density for different types of non-basement rock is also shown in 

Table 5.1: phyllites = 2.56 g/cm3; metasandstones = 2.61 g/cm3; diamictites and pebbly 

phyllites = 2.62 g/cm3; limestones = 2.68 g/cm3; and quartzites = 2.53 g/cm3. 

In order to use maximum density contrast for the computer modelling, Motta 

(1990) adopted 2.64 g/cm3 as the average density for the upper crust in the southeastern 

part of the Sergipano Fold Belt, and 2.57 g/cm3 for the metasediments. Thus the 

maximum density contrast between basement and cover in the southern part of the 

Sergipano Fold Belt was taken as 2.64 - 2.57 = 0.07 g/cm3. 

The upper crust was then modelled in terms of blocks of basement and 
metasediment, each with a density contrast relative to the average density of the crust 
(2.64), by considering the nature of the rocks on each part of the geological cross 
sections. Block boundaries and shapes were constrained by surface geology interpreted 
from the author's geological map and cross sections (Figs. 3.1 &amp;amp; 4.20). 

5.3 - Geophysical domains 

A detailed analysis of the aeromagnetic anomalies of Figure 5.3 has permitted 
identification of six geophysical domains (named A- F), each with a characteristic pattern 
of isolines and range of values (Motta 1990). 

135

Comparing the geophysical domains of Figure 5.3, with the geological map of 
Figure 3.1 (enclosure), it can be seen that each geophysical domain corresponds to rock 
types with distinct magnetic properties. 

5.3.1 - Domain A 
This domain occupies a roughly circular-shaped area with the town of Itabaiana 

in the centre (Fig. 5.3). It comprises aeromagnetic anomalies generally ranging from -
100 nT to -300 nT (dominantly between -100 nT and -200 nT) which form ellipsoids 
whose 2-4km long axis is generally oriented east-west. The shape of these anomalies is 
most likely a function of the line spacing (2km; Fig. 5.3) 

These elliptical anomalies also occur along a relatively narrow zone which 
extends to the east of Moita Bonita, as far as the Sergipe river (Fig. 5.3). Comparing this 
figure with the geological map of Figure 3.1, domain A corresponds to outcrops of the 
Itabaiana gneiss. The continuity of these anomalies towards the northeastern corner of 
the area of this study (Fig. 5.3) probably corresponds to shallowly buried basement, 
brought near to the surface by the Dores thrust (section 4.4.2). 

5.3.2 - Domain B 
Domain B consists of aeromagnetic anomalies which have the same elliptical 

shape of those in domain A, but the length of the ellipses is generally smaller, and the 
values generally range between -50 nT and -100 nT. These anomalies occur in two sub-
areas adjacent to the western side of domain A (Fig. 5.3). 

One sub-area of domain B occurs as an E-W trending narrow strip that passes 
around Simão Dias and spreads to the east and west of that town. Another sub-area 
surrounds the junction of the Salgado and Vaza Barris rivers. Comparison with the 
geological map of Figure 3.1 (enclosure) shows that the anomalies within the E-W 
narrow strip of domain B correspond to most of the outcrop area of the Simão Dias 
gneisses. 

The continuation of the same pattern of aeromagnetic anomalies to the western 
border of the study area also indicates that the Simão Dias gneiss most probably 
continues westward of the Simão Dias dome, and are probably buried at shallow levels 
below the metasediments. A similar interpretation applies to the sub-area surrounding the 
junction of the Salgado and Vaza Barris rivers, where surface outcrops generally consist 
of rocks of the Miaba Group. 

The aeromagnetic map of the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt at 
1:250,000 scale (Encal 1978) has shown that domain B can be traced continuously 
westwards from around Simão Dias as far as the eastern border of the Tucano basin, 
outside the area of this study (Motta 1990). 

5.3.3 - Domain C 
Domain C has a magnetic signature of typically straight isolines whose values 

range widely in a small distance across their strike. They occur to the north, south and 
west of domain A (Fig. 5.3). 

137 



The straight contours to the north of domain A are continuous toward the 

northwestern corner of the study area. A similar pattern of anomalies is observed along 

the northern border of the Simão Dias gneiss (domain B) just to the west of the Itabaiana 

dome. 

The anomalies of domain C correspond major fault zones within the southern 

part of the Sergipano Fold Belt (Motta 1990). These features are further discussed in 

section 5.4 . 

5.3.4 - Domain D 

This domain comprises a narrow WNW-ESE trending zone along the Vaza Barris 

river valley, in the southeastern corner of the Itabaiana Dome Area (Fig. 5.3). 

The anomalies of domain D are similar to those in domains A and B, and 

correspond to a continuation of outcrops of the Simão Dias gneisses to the southeastern 

part of the study area, where they probably correspond to exposed slices of basement 

rocks described by Davison &amp;amp; Santos (1989) at the eastern end of the Itaporanga fault. 

In that area, the trace of the Itaporanga fault follows the Vaza Barris river valley, and 

passes through the town of Itaporanga D'Ajuda (Fig. 2.3). 

Thus, the 45 km long strip of outcrops of the Simão Dias gneisses mapped in the 

Itabaiana Dome Area (this study), represents the exposed portion of a E-W trending 

subvertical slice of the crystalline basement which is at least 100 km long. This slice was 

tectonically emplaced parallel to the structural grain of the southern part of the Sergipano 

Fold Belt, very close to its boundary with the adjacent craton. 

5.3.5 - Domain E 

Domain E shows a pattern of concentric anomalies whose values range from 

+ 100 nT to -275 nT and which are much more circular and broader than the anomalies 

of domains A and B (Fig. 5.3). 

These anomalies occur in wide areas to the north and south of domain B, and 

correspond in the field to outcrops of the sediments and metasediments of the Miaba, 

Lagarto and Vaza Barris Groups (see the geological map of Fig. 3.1). They also occur in 

a wide area to the east of domain A. where they correspond to the sediments of the 

Sergipe-Alagoas basin. 

5.3.6 - Domain F 

Domain F has the same characteristics as domain E, but the aeromagnctic 

anomalies are even broader, and the values generally range between -25 nT and -75 nT 

(Fig. 5.3). These anomalies occur in the northern part of the study area, where the Frei 

Paulo and Ribeirópolis Formations are dominant. Another two similar areas are situated 

to the south of the study area. 

It can be seen from the geological map (Fig. 3.1) that these anomalies correspond 

to outcrops of sediments of the Sergipe-Alagoas basin (around Itaporanga DAjuda in 

Fig. 5.3) and sediments of the Lagarto-Palmares Formation (in the southwestern comer 

of the study area). 

138 



In conclusion, the aeromagnetic anomalies associated with the exposed or 
shallowly buried crystalline basement (domains A, B and D) show a greater variation 
than those elsewhere (domains E and F). The pattern can be interpreted as due to a 
generally greater content of magnetic minerals in the basement than elsewhere (and to the 
heterogeneous distribution of basic rocks within the gneisses, as is discussed in the next 
section). This has been confirmed during the collection of the field measurements, by the 
very low magnetic susceptibilities of the sediments and metasediments (Motta 1990). 

5.3.7 - The basement domains and radiometric data 
From a detailed analysis of the radiometric anomalies shown in the map of Figure 

5.4 (where the geological boundaries of the Itabaiana and Simão Dias gneisses have also 
been drawn), it can be seen that the crystalline basement has a distinct radiometric 
signature compared with that of the rest of the area. The areas occupied by the Itabaiana 
dome and by the broadest part of the Simão Dias dome are characterised by circular to 
elliptical anomalies with values of radioactivity normally less than 100 cps (scintillations 
per second), whereas these values range between 200 cps and 300 cps in most of the rest 
of the area (Fig. 5.4). 

However, inside the Itabaiana dome there are values between 100 cps and 200 
cps, particularly between Itabaiana and Moita Bonita, and also to the southeast of 
Itabaiana (Fig. 5.4). The lower values can be attributed to basement of more basic 
composition, and the higher values to basement of more acid composition, possibly 
reflecting the heterogeneous nature of the older crust (Motta 1990). 

Geological mapping shows (Fig. 3.1) that the basic rocks are more predominant 
in the south, west and northwestern parts of the Itabaiana dome. Although the field work 
was not carried out with the principal aim of separating basic and acid rocks in the 
basement (nor it would be accurately possible because of the discontinuous nature of the 
basement outcrops), it is clear that the basement is heterogeneous, particularly in the 
Itabaiana Dome Area. 

The above supports the interpretation by Motta (1990) that the basement can be 
sub-divided into blocks with subtle density contrasts. 

5.4 - Aeromagnetic signature of the regional faults in the Itabaiana Dome 
Area 
Figure 5.5 A-B displays part of the 1:250,000 scale map with the aeromagnetic 

anomalies of the southeastern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt (Encal 1978). This 
highlights the correlation between the linear aeromagnetic anomalies (typical of domain 
C) and regional faults, particularly in the Itabaiana Dome Area, as originally interpreted 
by Motta (1990). 

The fault zones corresponding to the São Miguel do Aleixo fault (Santos et al. 
1988; Davison &amp;amp; Santos 1989) and to the Itaporanga, Simão Dias, Vaza Barris and 
Mocambo faults (this study) are indicated in Figure 5.5 A. The aeromagnetic anomalies 
for the Itabaiana Dome Area are separated in Figure 5.5 B, but without the fault lines.

Figure 5.5 C is a reduced copy of the geological map (Fig. 2.4), highlighting the 
array of regional faults previously identified in the geological maps of the Itabaiana 
Dome Area. By comparing Figures 5.5 A-C, it is possible to see that the aeromagnetic 
signature of the Mocambo fault (Figs. 5.5 A &amp;amp; B) only partially corresponds to the trace 
adopted for the same fault in previous geological maps of the area (Fig. 5.5 C). 

In contrast, the trace of the Mocambo fault, as shown in Figure 5.5 A, seems to 
be much more realistic than that adopted in Figure 5.5 C, and additionally does not 
exclude the Pelada fault. As such, the Mocambo fault as now identified, fits with the 
entire aeromagnetic signature, and also fits with field observations described in sections 
3.3.4 and 4.4.2. 

5.5 - Geophysical sections in the Itabaiana Dome Area 
Figures 5.6 A, 5.7 A and 5.8 A (all in the enclosure) show profiles of the 

observed and calculated gravity and aeromagnetic data along the XX', YY', and ZZ' 
section lines. The gravity interpretative sections are shown respectively in Figures 5.6 B, 
5.7 B and 5.8 B, and the aeromagnetic interpretative sections are shown in Figures 5.6 
C, 5.7 C and 5.8 C. The interpretations have also taken into consideration the 
radiometric data (section 5.3). 

The crystalline basement was tentatively divided into blocks bounded by several 
convex upward surfaces, resembling the geometry of listric thrust faults which dip at 
high angles at the surface and become gradually subhorizontal with depth. Both the 
basement and the metasediments were tentatively divided into blocks with a contrast of 
densities, as generally indicated by the profiles (after the original report by Motta 1990). 

Comparing the gravity and aeromagnetic profiles of Figures 5.6 and 5.7, it can 
be seen that the gravity and magnetic interpretative profiles of the upper crust are 
generally in good agreement, with only local discrepancies. 

Also comparing these profiles with the geological cross sections across the 
basement domes (AB and EF, Fig. 4.20, enclosure) it can be seen that, despite the small 
amount of geophysical data, the geophysical interpretations support the depth of the 
basement and metasediments adopted in the geological cross sections. 

5.5.1 - The geophysical section XX' 
The observed and calculated Bouguer profiles of Figure 5.6 A show increasing 

values from south to north, although there is a depression between 26 km and 35 km. 
The concave upward part of the curve corresponds to the Simão Dias dome and to buried 
blocks of the basement close to the surface, immediately to the north of it, because their 
average density (2.64) is higher than the density of the metasediments (Motta 1990). 

The saddle in the 26-35 km interval may be explained by the greater thickness of 
the less dense metasediments in the Vaza Barris trough, between the Pelada and Escarpa 
faults, an area where the basement occurs at depths as great as 4 km (Fig. 5.6 B). 

Motta (1990) points out two minor differences between the aeromagnetic and the 
gravity interpretation. One difference is related to a marked break of the aeromagnetic 

141 



values between 10 and 15 km, in the southern part of the Simão Dias dome, and the 
other concerns the depth of the basement to the north of the Pelada and Mocambo faults 
(Fig. 5.6 A-C). 

At the southern border of the Simão Dias dome, the aeromagnetic interpretation 
has placed the blocks numbered 8 and 9 inside the Simão Dias dome (block 1) with 
different magnetic susceptibilities, whereas the gravity profile could be modelled as a 
single block of uniform density (Fig. 5.6 B). 

In the area to the north of the Pelada fault, the aeromagnetic data (Fig. 5.6 C) 
indicate that the basement occurs at a depth less than 2 km, and continues at this depth 
immediately to the north of the Mocambo fault. 

The gravity profile (Fig. 5.6 B) also suggests that the basement occurs at depths 
less than 2 km between the Pelada and Mocambo faults, but is deeper toward the 
Mocambo fault and across it, along a steeper gradient than in Figure 5.6 C. 

5.5.2 - The geophysical section YY' 
The observed and calculated Bouguer curves in this profile (Fig. 5.7 A) decrease 

continuously from SSW (Y) to 40 km NNE (Y'), where they reach a minimum and start 
to increase slightly towards the end of the profile. 

In detail, the plot of the observed and calculated Bouguer data across the 
Itabaiana dome (Fig. 5.7 A) shows open and sinusoidal variations along the profile, 
which Motta (1990) interpreted to be the result of several blocks with subtle density 
contrasts (Fig. 5.7 B). Most of the anomaly corresponds to the Itabaiana dome, which is 
bounded to the north by the Mocambo fault (Fig. 5.7 B). The relative depth of the 
basement just to the north of this fault is 4 km, and becomes gradually shallower 
towards the end of the profile. 

The aeromagnetic profile shows a pronounced low corresponding to the 
Mocambo fault (Fig. 5.7 A). The aeromagnetic interpretation of Figure 5.7 C is in good 
agreement with the gravity interpretation, except for the area to the north of the Mocambo 
fault, where it has not been possible to distinguish between basement and cover (Motta 
1990). 

5.5.3 - The geophysical section ZZ'Z" 

Figure 5.8 A shows the gravity and aeromagnetic data along the composite 
ZZ'Z" profile. Figure 5.8 B displays the gravity interpretation across the northern border 
of the study area, and also across the boundary between the southern and northern parts 
of the Sergipano Fold Belt, which is marked by the São Miguel do Aleixo fault, 
according to Santos et al. (1988) and Davison &amp;amp; Santos (1989). 

The Bouguer curves show positive values in the 0-94 km interval, and 
correspond to two gravity highs (named I and II in Fig. 5.8 A), which are separated by a 
gravity low (named III). 

The first high (I) corresponds to the outcrops of Itabaiana gneiss on the western 
side of the Itabaiana dome, and to the buried crystalline basement between the Mocambo 
and São Miguel do Aleixo faults. The second high (II) occurs in the northern part of the 

142 



profile, and corresponds to that part of the Sergipano Fold Belt between the São Miguel 
do Aleixo and Belo Monte-Jeremoabo faults (Fig. 5.8 B). 

The interpretation of the Bouguer profile for the northern part of the Sergipano 
Fold Belt agrees with the geophysical interpretation shown in Figure 2.8. Northward of 
94km the negative Bouguer values in the profile reflect the greatest thickness of 
metasediments in the Sergipano Fold Belt, which can be 13km (Santos et al. 1988). 

The gravity low (III) corresponds to outcrops of metasediment between the two 
gravity highs, which extend to an average depth of 3.5km. 

It is also noteworthy that in this gravity profile, the depth of the basement 
decreases from 2km, just to the north of the Mocambo fault, to 5km at the edge of the 
study area (Fig. 5.8 B). The depth of 2km, and the smoother gradient of the depth of the 
basement shown in this profile, are in accordance with the depth and gradient of depths 
of the basement in the aeromagnetic interpretation of Figure 5.6 C, rather than with the 
stronger gradient for the depth to the basement in the gravity interpretation (Fig. 5.6 B). 

Figure 5.8 B also shows several bodies of rocks with average density of 2.57 or 
2.55 (see blocks 6, 7, 9 and 10). Blocks 6, 9 and 10 correspond to outcrops of granite 
in the northern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt (Motta 1990). Block 7, which lies 
between the edge of the study area and the São Miguel do Aleixo fault, corresponds to 
the outcrops of Itabaiana quartzite (see the Campina and Redonda Ranges, Fig. 3.1), and 
outcrops of phyllites, pebbly phyllites and metavolcanics of the Ribeirópolis Formation 
(this study). 

However, the above interpretation does not eliminate the possibility of buried 
granitic bodies within or in the vicinity of block 7, just in the footwall of the São Miguel 
do Aleixo fault. 

The aeromagnetic profiles of Figure 5.8 A show two accentuated lows. The low 
at around 14km corresponds to the Mocambo fault (Fig. 5.8 B), whereas the low 
between 5 and 8km does not have a straightforward explanation from the surface 
geology. 

It may correspond to faults or subvertical mylonitic zones within the Itabaiana 
dome, an area generally covered by the colluvium of the Miaba range (Fig. 3.2). 
Alternatively, it could correspond to blocks with different magnetic susceptibilities within 
the crystalline basement, in the same way as has been interpreted for the Simão Dias 
dome (blocks 8 and 9, Fig. 5.6 C). This possibility fits well with the wide variety of 
lithologies observed within the western part of the Itabaiana dome. 

5.6 - Conclusions 
Because of the small amount of data, and the lack of seismic sections, 

geophysical knowledge of the Itabaiana Dome Area is relatively poor. However, 
computer modelling of the gravity and aeromagnetic field data, and analysis of the 
aeromagnetic and radiometric anomaly maps available in the literature (Motta 1990), 
permit the following conclusions to be drawn: 

143 



1 - The geophysical cross sections generally support the relative depth of the 

basement and metasediments used in the structural cross sections presented in Figures 

4.20 and 4.21. 
2 - The aeromagnetic and radiometric data allow a clear identification of the 

exposed areas of crystalline basement and the areas of sedimentary cover. 
3 - The aeromagnetic data provide good indications of the traces of the regional 

faults and of shallowly buried slices of crystalline basement. They indicate the continuity 
of the Simão Dias gneiss to the east and west of the field area, and the slices of Itabaiana 
gneiss in the hangingwall of the Dores thrust in the northeastern comer of the field area. 

4 - The Simão Dias gneisses are most probably the outcropping expression, in 
the area of study, of an E-W trending tectonic slice which stretches for more than 
100km. This slice was emplaced sub-vertically into highly deformed metasediments, 
along and very close to the northeastern border of the São Francisco Craton. 

5 - The crystalline basement is heterogeneous and may be sub-divided into 
blocks of different density and magnetic susceptibility, which probably reflect variable 
proportions of basic and acid compositions. 

6 - The upper crust in the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt may be 
interpreted in terms of wedge-shaped blocks of metasediment and crystalline basement, 
which resemble tectonic slices separated by listric-like fault planes merging downwards 
in a subhorizontal detachment at a depth of 10 km.

Chapter 6 - Geological evolution of the southern part of the Sergipano 

Fold Belt 

6.1 - Introduction 
This chapter has four main objectives -

1. To present an interpretation of the geological evolution of the Itabaiana Dome 

Area. 

2. To discuss the implications of the results of this research for the geological 

evolution of the whole of the Sergipano Fold Belt. 

3. To develop a model for the tectonic evolution of the Sergipano Fold Belt. 

4. To discuss the implications of this research in the analysis of the tectonic 

evolution of other Proterozoic fold belts, particularly those of the Pan-African and 

Brasiliano orogenic system. 

The geological evolution of the Itabaiana Dome Area is summarised and 

discussed in section 6.2 and models for the basin development, sedimentation, and for 

the structural and metamorphic evolution are proposed. The evolution of the basement 

domes is discussed. 

Section 6.3 discusses the significance of this research with respect to the 

evolution of the southern Sergipano Fold Belt and for the Sergipano Fold Belt as a 

whole. A tectonic model is proposed. 

Section 6.4 compares the geology of the Sergipano Fold Belt with that of other 

fold belts in the Pan-African-Brasiliano orogenic system, and the implications for 

Proterozoic crustal evolution are also discussed. 

6.2 - Geological evolution of the Itabaiana Dome Area 

6.2.1 - Introduction 
Figure 6.1 is a lithostructural summary map of the Itabaiana Dome Area. Figure 

6.2 is a simple domain map depicting the main lithotectonic regions of the Itabaiana 

Dome Area. The cratonic domain in the south consists of little to non deformed and non 

metamorphosed sediments (including the Lagarto Group). 

The WNW-ESE striking Itaporanga fault separates this domain in the south from 

the highly deformed, greenschist facies siliciclastic and carbonate metasediments (with 

minor metavolcanics) and the Itabaiana and Simão Dias gneiss dome complexes of the 

fold-thrust domain (Fig. 6.2). The SSW-NNE striking Propria fault separates the 

Proterozoic sequences from the Mesozoic Sergipe-Alagoas basin (Fig. 6.2). 

The Itabaiana Dome Area has undergone polyphase contractional deformation, 

ascribed to the Brasiliano Orogeny, with a peak of metamorphism at 673-600 Ma (Brito 

Neves &amp;amp; Cordani 1973; Gava et al. 1983). The dominant structures are large, southwest 

vergent recumbent Fj folds, SW vergent F2 folds and associated high angle thnist faults 

together with two basement gneiss domes mantled by metasediments (Fig. 6.1).

Oblique sinistral strike-slip motion along some of the major high angle thrust 

faults is also found. Major strike-slip faults arc the Vaza Barris fault and the Mocambo 

shear (Figs. 6.1 &amp;amp; 6.2). 

The basement gneiss domes are fault-bounded on their northern and southern 

margins. The basement gneiss mctascdiment cover contact is generally sheared and 

subvertical. The basal unconformity is found undeformed at the eastern margin of the 

Itabaiana dome (Fig. 6.1). The western margin of the Itabaiana dome has a basement-

denved phyllonttic zone parallel to and also and along part of the basal unconformity 

(Fig. 6.1). Extensional shear bands in this zone consistently indicate a top down to the 

WNW movement (section 3.3.2). 

6.2.2 - Stratigraphy of the Itabaiana Dome Area 

The Itabaiana Dome Area mapped during the course of this research includes 

both the cratonic domain (undeformed or little deformed sediments) and the south 

vergent fold/thrust terrane (Fig. 6.2). A new stratigraphy has been established for the 

area (Chapter 3) based upon detailed mapping, structural analysis and the application of 

sequence stratigraphic principles (e.g. Hubbard et a]. 1985 a; Wagoner et al. 1987). 

This new stratigraphy (summarised in Fig. 6.3) shows that strata deposited 

essentially on the craton consist of the Estância and Lagarto Groups whereas strata 

deposited within the basin (probably best described here as a miogeocline) consist of the 

Miaba, Lagarto and Vaza Barris Groups (Fig. 6.3). Thicknesses on the craton total 

approximately 1 km whereas in the basin thicknesses total approximately 4 km. 

The age of sedimentation is generally inferred to be Mid to Late Proterozoic 

(1000-900 Ma) based upon lithostratigraphic correlations with the Bambui Group (Cloud 

&amp;amp; Dardenne 1973; Misi 1976). Detailed stratigraphic relationships and the scdimentology 

of the units are described in Chapter 3. These data, combined with stratigraphic and 

sedimentological descriptions in other research in lhe souüiern part of the Sergipano Fold 

Belt, has allowed new stratigraphic interpretations to be made (Fig. 6.3). 

1. The Juetê Formation correlates with the Itabaiana Formation: both 

unconformably overlie the crystalline basement and are overlain by carbonates. 

Moreover the meta-arkosic sandstones and red-brown phyllites of the Itabaiana 

Formation may be correlated with similar lithologies in the Juetê Formation of Suva 

Filho et al. (1978 a &amp;amp; b) and Saes (1984). 

2. The Acauã Formation may be correlated with the Jacoca Formation - both are 

carbonates and both are overlain by the Lagarto Group. 

3. The Lagarto Group includes the Lagarto-Palmares, Jacaré and Frei Pajlo 

Formations, which are overlain by the Palestina Diamictites - a distinct unit in the basin. 

Despite the intense polyphase deformation that has obscured thickness changes 

and also perhaps original unconformity surfaces, the structural and stratigraphic analysis 

of this research has enabled to recognise four megasequences (Hubbard et al. 1985 a &amp;amp; 

b) that divide the sedimentary evolution of the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt 

in two distinct cycles, each one characterised by a lower siliciclastic megasequence and 

an upper carbonate megasequence (Fig. 6.3).

Cycle I has a lower siliciclastic megasequence consisting of the Juetê-Itabaiana 
and Ribeirópolis Formations, and an upper carbonate megasequence consisting of the 
Acauã-Jacoca Formations. Cycle II has a lower siliciclastic megasequence consisting of 
the Lagarto and Palestina sequences overlain by the Olhos D'agua upper carbonate 
megasequence (Fig. 6.3). 

It is important to note that each carbonate megasequence exhibits shallowing 
upwards facies (Section 3.4) and overlies different siliciclastic units and, in places, the 
basement. The Acauã carbonates are either in sharp contact with the Juetê siliciclastics or 
with the crystalline basement in the cratonic domain (Silva Filho et ai. 1978 a &amp;amp;b; Saes 
1984). In the Itabaiana Dome Area, the Jacoca carbonates are in sharp contact with the 
Ribeirópolis conglomerates and with Itabaiana quartzites, in the Capitão farm area (e.g. 
Fig. 3.11 B &amp;amp; outcrop 312). 

6.2.3 - Depositions! environments, facies and 
thickness distributions 

Siliciclastic sedimentation 

Cycle I The basal cross-bedded Itabaiana quartzites that unconformably overlie 
the basement may be interpreted to have been deposited in a shallow marine environment 
(cf. interpretations by Walker 1985a) whereas the interbedded arkosic metasandstones 
and reddish brown phyllites of the Itabaiana Formation may be interpreted to indicate 
rejuvenation and uplift of hinterland areas of the crystalline basement (cf. Dickinson &amp;amp; 
Suczek 1979). The overlying Ribeirópolis Formation pebbly phyllites probably indicate 
erosion of tectonically uplifted hinterland areas and deposition by mass flows (section 
3.4.4). The lower siliciclastic megasequence indicate a continental to shallow marine 
sedimentary environment with the clastic source area to the south, together with the 
development of a miogeocline to the north. Active extensional tectonics during 
deposition were probably responsible for the mass flow deposits. 

Cycle II The lower siliciclastic sequence is characterised by the northward 
progradation and upward coarsening of the shallow marine sandstones, siltstones and 
mudstones of the Lagarto Group. Outboard miogeoclinal equivalents of the Lagarto-
Palmares sandstones are the Jacaré metasiltites and the Frei Paulo phyllites (Fig. 6.1). 
This may be interpreted to indicate rejuvenation of the hinterland on the craton to the 
south either by a sea level fall or by tectonism (as compared to the relatively quiescent 
period during which the shallowing upwards sequence of the underlying carbonates was 
deposited). The petrography of the Lagarto-Palmares sandstones indicates that they were 
derived from crystalline basement with additional detrital input from low grade 
metasediments and metavolcanics (Table 3.1). The sandstone bodies in the Frei Paulo 
Formation to the north of the Vaza Barris trough suggests erosion of uplifted basement 
blocks to the north of the trough (section 3.7). 

ISO 



Carbonate sedimentation 
From the detailed descriptions and map distribution of the lithofacies in the 

Itabaiana Dome Area (section 3.4) it is apparent that both the Jacoca and Olhos D'agua 
Formations strongly suggest that the Itabaiana and Simão Dias domes were paleohighs 
during the evolution of the miogeocline. Facies interpretations (section 3.4.5) indicate 
that both are shallowing upward carbonate sequences. A period of relative quiescence 
may be inferred during the deposition of the Jacoca and Olhos D'agua sequences, 
because of the lack of slumping, debris flows and turbidites, as found on carbonate 
platforms that underwent syndepositional tectonism (e.g. Hcrrington &amp;amp; Fairchild 1989; 
Bechstadt &amp;amp; Boni 1989). 

Cycle I Jacoca carbonates. The Jacoca carbonates die out from the Itabaiana dome 
into the area between the Pelada and Escarpa faults, and also to the north of the 
Mocambo fault (Fig. 6.1). The base of the formation starts with what may be interpreted 
as offshore shelf facies (parallel-laminated and thinly intercalated carbonate and fine 
siliciclastics, - distal turbidites), and passes upwards into subtidal-intertidal facies, with 
oolites, intraclasts and wave-reworked structures indicating an agitated, near shore 
environment 

Cycle II Olhos D'agua carbonates. The thick Olhos D'Agua carbonates around the 
Simão Dias dome pass upwards into subtidal-intertidal facies, with oolites, intraclasts 
and wave-reworked structures also indicating a near shore environment, and pass into 
siliciclastic-rich carbonate facies, across the Escarpa fault and Vaza Barris trough, up to 
the north of the Mocambo fault (Fig. 6.1). 

Thickness variations 
Despite the limitations imposed by the intense deformation, the estimates of 

stratigraphic thicknesses indicate that, apart from lhe Itabaiana quartzites (which are 
generally =10-50m thick and locally up to =700m in the vicinity of the Itabaiana dome), 
the siliciclastics are significantly thinner (0-100m) near the basement domes than 
elsewhere in the map area. The greatest accumulations of siliciclastics (=500m) occur 
between the Escarpa and Pelada faults, in the so called Vaza Barris trough, as well as to 
the north of the Mocambo fault (Fig. 6.1). 

The Vaza Barris trough, which is also the depocentre for the Palestina 
diamictites, also contains the most of the volcanics (and probable volcanoclastics) of the 
Frei Paulo Formation, whereas to the north of the Mocambo fault most of the 
Ribeirópolis volcanism is found (Fig. 6.1). 

Consideration of the stratigraphic, sedimentological and thickness relationships 

outlined above (and given in detail in Chapter 3) permits an interpretation that Cycle 1 

began with a shalLow marine deposition onto the basement (Itabaiana sandstones) 

followed by deepening of the basin and possible active tectonism (Ribeirópolis 

Formation), to progressive shallowing of the basin and the development of the Jacoca 

151 



carbonates (particularly flanking the paleohighs of the Itabaiana and the Simão Dias 

domes). Cycle II indicates regeneration of the hinterland (probably through tectonism), 

deposition of the Lagarto Group and the Palestina Formation probably in fault bounded 

basins (e.g. the Vaza Barris trough) followed by a second shallowing upward carbonate 

sequence (the upper carbonate megasequence - Fig. 6.3) that infills the basin to the north 

of the Ituporanga fault. 

The wide variety of lithofacies and their overall distribution and thickness 

variations indicates deposition in an open platformal environment containing relatively 

deep water environments in extensional fault bounded basins on the craton margin - i.e. 

a miogeocline with the craton to the south. The fact that now most of these thickness and 

facies variations are found across major thrust faults supports an interpretation that the 

thrust faults are inverted extensional faults. 

These conclusions are supported by other researchers (Humphrey &amp;amp; Allard 

1962, 1967, 1969; Silva Filho et ai. 1978 a &amp;amp; b) who interpreted a shallow marine 

environment and a miogeocline sedimentation in the southern part of the Sergipano Fold 

Belt. In addition basins with well documented thickness variations together with lateral 

and venical superposition of shallow water and relatively deep-water facies and 

geographically related to regional extensional faults, have been interpreted as examples 

of syn-extensional sedimentation (e.g. Mitchell &amp;amp; Owens 1990; Trexler &amp;amp; Nitchman 

1990; Collier 1991). 

6.2.4 - Basin evolution: a model for the Itabaiana Dome Area 

In order to erect a model for the development of a sedimentary basin it is, in ideal 

cases, necessary to take into account the geometry of the basin, the stratal thicknesses 

throughout the basin, age relationships, subsidence and thermal histories, compaction 

effects (Barr 1991), as well, as the nature of the faulting controlling basin development 

(i.e. mode of extensional faulting - simple shear versus pure shear). 

The model of basin evolution for the Itabaiana Dome Area (Figs. 6.4 &amp;amp; 6.5) has 

been based on the evidence (5:1 to 20:1 thickness variations; facies variations) for a 

tectonically controlled sedimentation up to the deposition of the third megasequence. 

The model assumes a simple shear style, linked lisrric detachment architecture 

(cf. Wernicke &amp;amp; Burchfiel 1982; Wernicke 1985; Gibbs 1984, 1987) in which the 

southern part of the Sergipano Basin is interpreted as a half graben developed upon a 

listric basal detachment, with a ramp-flat geometry, together with a system of synthetic 

and antithetic, planar and listric normal faults that accommodate the cumulative strain of 

the extending hangingwall. The Vaza Barris trough is interpreted as a major, long lived, 

ramp syncline or crestai collapse graben. Two major periods of extension are postulated 

corresponding to the development of the two siliciclastic megasequences, followed by 

periods of relative tectonic quiescence and deposition of the carbonate megasequences. 

Despite the increasing debate concerning extensional systems of listric versus 

planar faults (Kusznir et al. 1991), recent seismic investigations across the Rhine 

graben, between Germany and France (Brun et al. 1991), has resulted for example in a 

half graben interpretation similar to that proposed here.

Figure 6.5 - Evolution of the basin and sedimentary infill. A and B show respectively the deposition of the Lagarto 
and Vaza Barris Groups (Cycle II). The megasequence boundaries of Figure 6.3 are indicated in the legend. 



A linked listric detachment (simple shear model) is favoured because: 
1. The thicknesses of most of the sequences increases to the north away from the 

era ton. 
2. The Palestina diamictites are deposited in a long lived trough - Vaza Barris 

trough. 
3. Extensional fault activity is indicated by the presence of large polylithic clasts 

of both basement and cover sediments in the succession (cf. Ribcirópolis pebbly 
phyllites and also Palestina Formation diamictites adjacent to the Simão Dias and 
Mocambo faults). These indicate uplift and erosion of footwall blocks (and possibly 
hangingwall blocks) at two periods during the evolution of the basin. 

4. The lack of multiple wedge shaped sedimentary sequences within the 
succession. These would be produced if extension on the basin margin dominantly 
occurred by an array of domino style faults. 

Although other fault styles have been proposed for extensional sedimentary 
basins (e.g. domino-style faults Barr 1987; Davison 1989; and flexural cantilever models 
- Kusznir et al. 1991; Roberts &amp;amp; Yielding 1991) a listric detachment style similar to that 
proposed for extending continental margins (e.g. Lister et al. 1986) or for the Rhine 
Graben (Brun et al. 1991) appear to be the most appropriate to explain the original 
architecture of the southern part of the Sergipano Basin (keeping in mind the difficulties 

in determining thickness variations obscured by the strong tectonic overprint). 

The Model 
The model for the evolution of the Itabaiana Dome Area is depicted in Figures 6.4 for the 

first cycle and Figure 6.5 for the second major depositional cycle. 

Cycle l Evolution of the lower siliciclastic megasequence. 
Deposition of the lower siliciclastic megasequence was synchronous with the 

development of extensional faulting on a listric detachment that dipped northwards at the 
craton margin (Fig. 6.4 A), Shallow marine arkosic sandstones with intercalated 
mudstones of the Itabaiana Formation were deposited at this time. Active extensional 
faulting is evidenced by local conglomerates and diamictites together with thickness 
variations of 20:1 across the Itaporanga and Simão Dias faults. The sequence fines 
upwards into the Ribcirópolis Formation, with continued extension indicated by the 
Ribcirópolis diamictites. 

The Itabaiana dome and also probably the Simão Dias dome evolved as 
paleohighs (Fig. 6.4 B) at this time with the development of shallow water environments 
that ultimately lead to the deposition of the Jacoca carbonates (first carbonate 
megasequence). This extension probably caused progressive uplift of the Itabaiana 
dome, as part of a rollover anticline. The Mocambo fault is interpreted to have been 
active at this stage (Fig. 6.3 B). 

The model accounts for the local conglomeratic fades within the upper Itabaiana 

quartzites and in the lower Ribeirôpolis Formation (western and eastern sides of the 

1 5 5 



Itabaiana dome - 150m of Jacarecica diamiciites (here in the Ribeirópolis Formation) 
with 1.2m size clasts of basement, in the north-northeastern border of the Itabaiana dome 
(Humphrey &amp;amp; Allard 1969), and accounts for the thinning of the Ribeirópolis Formation 
towards the dome, together with the voluminous Ribeirópolis phyllitcs to the north of the 
Mocambo fault, an area that also contain a significant amount of pebbly phyllitcs, 
diamictites and volcanics. 

Cycle I Lower carbonate megasequence. 

This phase of extension was probably followed by a period of thermally driven 

subsidence, leading to the development of the the Acauã and Jacoca Formations around 

the Itabaiana dome (Fig. 6.4 C). 

Cycle II Evolution of the upper siliciclastic megasequence. 
The second major sedimentary cycle records the onset of a second -phase of 

rifting that begins with the deposition of the Lagarto Group and records the greatest 
activity during deposition of the Palestina diamictites (Fig. 6.5 A). The Vaza Barris 
trough probably developed as a ramp syncline during this period and was the major 
depocentre in the area. The Lagarto Group likely reflects the development of a 
progradational delta system from the craton, to the south, onto the craton margins 
(section 3.7). 

Cycle II Upper carbonate megasequence. 

A second phase of thermal subsidence is postulated to account for the 
development of the widespread carbonate platform of the Olhos D'agua sequence (Fig. 
6.5 B). This may be interpreted as a post-rift sequence that infills the basin and onlaps 
onto the craton margins. 

The basin model outlined above shows many similarities to those proposed for 

other Proterozoic basins developed on craton margins elsewhere in the world. The Mid-

to Late Proterozoic of the Purcell and Windermere Supergroups, in the western 

Cordillera of North America, shows similar cycles of extensional fault controlled 

sedimentation passing upwards into shallowing upwards carbonate sequences (Pope 

1989). The Adelaidian of South Australia also shows a similar stratigraphic record 

(Preiss 1987). 

6.2.5 - S t r u c t u r a l a n d m e t a m o r p h i c evolution of the I t a b a i a n a 

Dome Area 

S t r u c t u r a l evolution 

Detailed mapping and structural analysis has shown that the metasediments of the 

Itabaiana Dome Area underwent three phases of ductile to ductile-brittle deformation 

(Chapter 4) during the Brasiliano orogeny. The dominant structures are southwest 

vergent recumbent F; folds (probably nappes) and southwest vergent more upright F2 

156 



folds and high angle thrust faults with oblique slip (Fig. 6.1). Dj structures are 

crenulation and kink folds which are associated with sinistral movement along the major 

fault structures such as the Simão Dias and Itaporanga faults (Fig. 6.1). 

The basement gneiss domes had undergone a history of high grade amphibolite 

facies deformation and tnetamorphism (section 4.2.1) prior to the D( to D3 Brasiliano 

deformations which are the focus of this study. Di, D2 and D3 deformations affected 

both the gneissic basement domes and their cover of metascdiments (section 4.9). 

Dj t o D 3 deformations are interpreted as a progressive polyphase deformation as 

the Sergipano Basin underwent contraction with tectonic transport onto the São 

Francisco Craton, from NNE to SSW. A summary of the structural elements is given in 

Figure 6.6 and a detailed structural synopsis is given in Chapter 4. 

D, Deformation 

Dl is interpreted as a progressive event of SSW directed layer-parallel shearing and 

shortening, responsible for the pervasive subhorizontal S, foliation, shearing of the 

basement-cover contact, and development of rootless intrafolial F | folds, and for the 

outcrop scale low-angle thrusting (Fig. 6.6). The best exposure of D j structures is in the 

Capitão farm outcrop (Fig. 4.24) - additional evidence comes from outside the Itabaiana 

Dome Area (e.g. Santos et al. 1988; Jardim de Sá et ai. 1986). Map-scale stratigraphic 

repetitions are interpreted as F[ recumbent folds, probably nappes (Fig. 6.1). 

£&gt;2 Deformation 

Dj deformation records a progressive NNE to SSW shortening by nearly upright folding 

and high-angle south vergent thrusting. Penetrative S2 foliations are developed together 

with an L2 lineation and stretching fabric parallel to the strike of the orogen (section 4.9). 

The regional faults appear to be zones of high strain concentration. Deformed clasts 

within the Palestina Formation indicate a prolate finite strain ellipsoid (section 4.4.4), 

which together with syn-D2 deformed veins (section 4.4.5) are indicative of orogen 

parallel extension - a common feature observed in many contractional/collisional orogens 

and probably indicative of a transpressive tectonic regime with a component of orogen-

parallel strike-slip movement (e.g. Ellis &amp;amp; Watkinson 1987). 

Because D2 probably occurred under various degrees of shortening with top to 

the south shearing along strike, the F2 folds may be expected to have curved hinges on a 

regional scale and thus may account for the double plunge of L2 in the Itabaiana Dome 

Area (section 4.4.1). The Itaporanga fault is interpreted to be the sole thrust or basal 

detachment for this phase of deformation (Figs. 4.22 A &amp;amp; B). 

O j Deformation 

D3 is a non penetrative kinking, crenulation folding and strike-slip event that is 

interpreted to be a consequence of the strike-slip movement along the major faults 

(section 4.9). A differential degree of slip along the pre-existing S surfaces (e.g. S 2 , S ( , 

SQ and S n) during Dj may account for the fan of L3 directions throughout the map area 

(section 4.5 &amp;amp; Fig. 4.17).

Evolution of the basement gneiss domes 

The presence of basement gneiss domes in the southern part of the Sergipano 

Fold Belt has important tectonic implications. The origins of basement gneiss domes 

within orogenic belts have been the subject of considerable debate (Hanks &amp;amp; Wallace 

1990). Models for their evolution include - domes produced by fold interference (e.g. 

Ramsay 1967), diapirism (e.g. Ramberg 1981; Coward 1981b; Brun 1983; Windley 

1984), basement cored fold nappes (e.g. Holdsworth 1989; Davis et al. 1991; Brown et 

al. 1991) or as basement cored anticlines (Murphy 1990). In some instances the 

presence of extensional shear zones along the margins of the gneiss complexes has lead 

to their interpretation as metamorphic core complexes produced by extensional 

exhumation and thinning of the contractional orogen (e.g. Coney &amp;amp; Harms 1984; Davis 

&amp;amp; Lister 1988; Lister &amp;amp; Davis 1989; Malavieille &amp;amp; Taboada 1991). 

In the Itabaiana Dome Area the metamorphic grade and the presence of both D | 

and D2 structural elements in the gneisses (Chapter 4) implies that they are involved in 

the thrusting and that the basal detachment for the contractional deformation was 

therefore within the gneisses. The distribution of sediments together with facics and 

thickness changes around the gneiss domes (see section 6.2.3 above) indicates that they 

evolved as paleohighs during sedimentation. The extensional fault model proposed for 

basin formation (Figs. 6.4 &amp;amp; 6.5) can therefore also account for the structural position of 

the gneiss domes in the fold belt as the result of contractional reactivation of extensional 

faults bounding basement fault slices. 

The contact relationships between the gneiss domes and their metasedimentary 

cover, however, warrant further discussion. As described in section 3.3.2, the gneiss 

domes exhibit both unconformity and sheared contacts with the metasedimentary cover. 

In particular the wes:ern flank of the Itabaiana dome contains the prominent Macambira 

phyllonites which indicate a top down to the west extensional event (section 3.3.2). 

Humphrey &amp;amp; Allard (1969) interpreted the phyllonites as an older deformation of 

the crystalline basement, and that the extensional fabrics were possibly related to the 

Brasiliano age evolution of the dome. Although their conclusion was based upon the 

apparently discordant trends of the phyllonites with respect to the basal unconformity, 

and upon folds and extensional fabrics affecting both the phyllonites and Itabaiana 

quartzites (section 3.3.2), they did not present conclusive evidence that the Macambira 

phyllonites are older than the basal unconformity (this was confirmed in a written 

communication with Professor Gilles Allard in 1992). 

The phyllonites are considered here a s y n - D 2 extensional structure (to date no 

phyllonite clasts have not been described in the cover metasediments) and have been 

affected by F2 folds together with the extensional fabrics and Itabaiana quartzites, as 

result of a progressive deformation. 

Figure 6.7 summarises in a diagrammatic way the evolution of the Itabaiana 

dome. A combination of differential uplift of the dome, folding and thrusting during D2 

deformation and a syn-D2 transpression E-W trending squeezing out of the ductile 

basement, offers a feasible explanation for the progressive development of a ductile 

shear zone sub-parallel to the basal unconformity in the western side of the dome (the

quartzites are shown in dark grey. All the scales are approximate.

Macambira phyllonites), and for the progressive top down to the west movement 

responsible for the extensional shear bands affecting the phyllonites. During late D2 
deformation the dome probably underwent bulk rotation bounded by the major fault 

zones (Fig. 6.7 E). The rotation accounts for the particular NNW-SSE orientation of S2 
and L2 in the eastern and western structural domains (section 4.6.4 &amp;amp; Fig. 4.2) which 

is not satisfactorily explained by simple stress refraction around a relatively rigid gneiss 

dome. 

The Simão Dias dome probably evolved as a series of basement slices bounded 

by listric extensional faults (Figs. 6.5 D &amp;amp; E), which were subsequently folded and 

uplifted during the positive inversion. 

Metamorphic evolution 
The mineral assemblages and textural relationships (section 4.8) in the Itabaiana 

Dome Area indicate that the Brasiliano deformation and metamorphism occurred under 

greenschist facies conditions. The basement gneisses appear to have been retrogressed 

from amphibolite facies and now display amphibole-epidote-chlorite assemblages. The 

metasediments generally display greenschist facies assemblages with the development of 

chlorite in suitable lithologies. 

The carbonates and siliciclastics of the Itabaiana Dome Area do not lend 

themselves to detailed PTt studies (of. England &amp;amp; Thompson 1984; Thompson &amp;amp; 

England 1984) at greenschist facies and in particular because of the lack of age 

determinations in this area. In addition there is a distinct lack of porphyroblast 

development necessary for such studies in polydeformed terranes (Vernon 1989). 

Metamorphic conditions appear to range from sub-greenschist facies in the 

cratonic domain to greenschist facies in the metasediments and greenschist facies 

retrogression in the basement gneisses (section 4.8 &amp;amp; Fig. 6.6). Textural relationships 

indicate that the greenschist facies conditions persisted for deformation phases D1 and D2 
whereas D3 appears to be post peak of metamorphism. 

6.3 - Tectonic evolution of the southern pari of the Sergipano Fold Belt 
and of the whole Sergipano Fold Belt 

6.3.1 - Introduction 

In this section are discussed the implications of this research on the. Itabaiana 

Dome Area for the southern part of Sergipano Fold Belt and for the fold belt as a whole. 

Particular emphasis is placed on the significance of the new stratigraphic interpretations 

and the structural interpretations. The first part of the discussion is focused upon 

stratigraphic and structural correlations between the Itabaiana Dome Area and the Carira 

area to the north. 

Figure 6.8 is a geological map of the Itabaiana-Carira area, east of the 38 °W 

meridian and between the southern and northern parts of the Sergipano Fold Belt. The 

two parts of the belt are separated by the São Miguel do Aleixo and Dores faults. The

Closer to this dome, the carbonate layers of the Jacoca Formation to the north of 

the Mocambo fault are normally 10-100cm thick, and the siliciclastic fraction consists of 

meta-argillites, variegated phyllites and dark grey to black phyllites, with subordinate 

layers of metasiltites and fine grained mctasandstones (section 3.3.3). Far from the 

Itabaiana Dome Area, Santos et al. (1988) described the continuation of the Jacoca 

carbonates (their Pfpr2 lithofacies) as interbedded metasiltites, fine-grained sandstones, 

together with&amp;lt;10cm-thick layers of metacarbonale and marls. They also described 

parallel stratifications and small-scale wavy-reworked structures, and interpreted this 

lithofacies as proximal rhythmites. 

This feature can be associated with sandy input from the north-northwest of the 

Vaza Barris trough, since before the deposition of the Frei Paulo Formation (it is 

accepted that carbonate sedimentation dies with increasing siliciclastic supply - Sellwood 

1986; Hanselman et al. 1974; Grotzinger 1989). 

3. The Ribciropolis Formation mapped to the north of the Itabaiana dome 

(section 3.3.4) now encompasses the pebbly phyllites, phyllites, metagreywackes, 

diamictites and me.ravolcanics which were mapped by Santos et al. (1988) to the south of 

the São Miguel do Aleixo fault (Fig. 6.8), and interpreted as part of the Capitão-Palestina 

Formation. Their position relative to the structure is also in agreement with this revised 

correlation. 

4. The lenses of quanzite mapped as the Capitão-Palestina Formation by Santos 

et al. (1988) are here interpreted to be part of the Itabaiana Formation (Fig. 6.8) as these 

units are laterally continuous with the Itabaiana Formation mapped in the Redonda and 

Campina ranges (Fig. 3.1). In the hangingwall of the Dores fault lenses of Itabaiana 

quartzites have been emplaced riding on slices of basement derived phyllonites thus 

lending additional weight to this correlation. 

6.3.3 - Structure of the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt 
The structural cross-sections across the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt 

(Fig. 6.9) were constructed using the same style as that for the sections through the 

Itabaiana Dome Area (Figs. 4.20 &amp;amp; 4.21). The fold pattern of large-scale F1 folds co-

axially refolded by F2 folds form a classical type 3 interference pattern (Ramsay 1967), 

disrupted and uplifted by high-angle thrust faults. 

The three recumbent F1 folds in the Itabaiana Dome Area (Figs. 6.8 &amp;amp; 6.9 A) 

account for the stratigraphic repetition of the Frei Paulo Formation to the west of the 

Simão Dias dome (section 3.3.3). These folds have 30km of amplitude and may be 

nappes associated with subhorizontal thrusts - as those described elsewhere in the 

southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt (Jardim de Sá et al. 1986; Brito Neves et al. 

1987; Campos Neto &amp;amp; Brito Neves 1987). 

6.3.4 - Structural and lithostratigraphic interpretations 

The structural interpretation above is consistent with the small scale structures 

observed in the Capitão farm outcrop (Fig. 4.24) and the F1 fold which repeats the 

stratigraphy to the west of the Simão Dias dome agrees with the strong layer-parallel S1

fabric described in the Frei Paulo sandy phyllites of that area (section 4.3). Although no 

structural field evidence has been found as yet for the two F, folds to the north of the 

Pelada fault (Fig. 6.8) such an interpretation combines the stratigraphic repetition to the 

west of the Simão Dias dome with the lithostratigraphic interpretations to the north of the 

Mocambo fault, as illustrated in Figure 6,10. 

The concept is that the F1 recumbent folds (possibly associated with low-angle 

thrusts, as they appear in the Capitão farm outcrop, Fig. 4.24) nucleated in the northern 

part of lhe area, near the future Mocambo thrust (Figs. 6.10 A &amp;amp; B). The thick Olhos 

D'água carbonates may have acted as a barrier to the southward tectonic transport during 

D1, and were folded along all of the northern border of the Vaza Barris trough, which 

was possibly an important structural discontinuity during basin inversion. 

As a consequence of this recumbent folding and/or thrusting, the Frei Paulo 

sandy phyllites of the northern part of the Vaza Barris trough were thinned and 

disrupted, being displaced from their northern position toward the western side of the 

Simão Dias dome. 

During the D2 deformation (Fig. 6.10 C), the subhorizontal F1 overthickened 

hinges in the Jacoca and Olhos D'água Formations to the north of the trough, possibly 

also acted as barriers to the deformation, and were progressively rotated to subvertical 

positions. With the progressive shortening, the already thinned Frei Paulo phyllites were 

compressed within the two carbonate hinges, and probably acted as the detachment level 

for the Mocambo thrust. 

6.3.5 - Lithostructural continuity in the Sergipano Fold Belt 
This research presents strong evidence for lithological and subdural correlation 

between the southern and northern pans of the Sergipano Fold Belt, across the Dores 

and São Miguel do Aleixo faults (Fig. 6.8). 

The lithological evidence is provided by the Itabaiana quartzites and slices of 

basement in the hangingwall of the Dores thrust fault (Fig. 6.8) and by their geophysical 

continuity with the Itabaiana gneisses (domain A, Fig. 5.3). In fact, as the Macururé 

Group consists of quartzites (and mantled gneissic domes), mylonitic quartzites, 

metacarbonates, phyllites, metasillites. metagreywackes, biotite- and staurolite-gamet 

schists, chlorite-quartz schists, and intermediary metavolcanics (Silva Filho et al. 1978 a 

&amp;amp; b; Santos et al. 1988). it compares well with the Miaba and part of the Lagarto Group 

(if the latter were metamorphosed at higher grade and intruded by granites). 

This is supported by the fact that the interpretations in the structural cross 

sections of the southern part of the belt (AB and EF, Figs. 6.8 &amp;amp; 6.9) can be extended 

across the São Miguel do Aleixo and Dores faults (ABB' and EFF'). The depth of the 

basement in the hangingwall of the São Miguel do Aleixo fault (Fig. 6.9 A) is supported 

by geophysical data (section ZZ'Z", Fig. 5.8). The depth of the crystalline basement in 

the hangingwall of the Dores fault (Fig. 6.9 B) is supported by field and geophysical 

data (sections 4.4.4 &amp;amp; 5.3). 

If the F1 recumbent folds interpreted for the Itabaiana Dome Area (Figs. 6.9 A &amp;amp; 

B) are in continuity with the F, nappe structures described elsewhere in the Macururé 

167

Domain (Figs. 2.6 A, B, D &amp;amp; E), the core of the F, folds currently outcropping in the 

Macururé Domain must consist of Miaba- and Lagarto Group-equivalent metasediments, 

lending support to the lithological continuity discussed above. Thus, the F1 structures 

across the domain boundary would form a 10km-thick pile of folded and thrust 

metasediments above the granites of the Macururé Domain (Fig. 6.9 A), which is in 

accordance with the interpreted depth of granite intrusion (Giuliani &amp;amp; Santos 1988). 

6.3.6 - Tectonic evolution of lhe Sergipano Fold Belt 

The results of this research combined with data from the literature permit the 

development of a model for the tectonic evolution of the Sergipano Fold Belt. Such a 

model must account for the basin development (e.g. section 6.2.4 above), the structural 

development of the fold belt and to relate this to the regional tectonics of the São 

Francisco Craton. 

Tectonic Domains 
Three tectonic domains have been recognised in the Sergipano Fold Belt (Fig. 

6.11). From south to north these are - the Estância Domain (cratonic), the Miaba /Vaza 

Barris Domain (southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt - miogeocline) , and the 

Macururé Domain (northern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt - the eugeocline and the 

hinterland of the orogen). The occurrence of mantled basement gneiss domes and 

basement derived migmatites in these domains (Fig. 6.11) indicates that the original 

sediments were deposited upon extended continental basement of the São Francisco 

Craton, which is also supported by geophysical data (Santos et al. 1988; Motta 1990), 

and is accepted in most of the literature of the area (Davison &amp;amp; Santos 1989). 

However, the fault-bounded Canindé, Poço Redondo and Marancó Domains 

(Santos et al. 1988; Davison &amp;amp; Santos 1989) located to the north of the Macururé 

Domain (Fig. 6.11), can be associated with the evolution of a small oceanic basin, as 
will be discussed in section 6.4, therefore a collisional suture between the São Francisco 

Craton and the Pernambuco-Alagoas Massif is inferred to the south of the Canindé 

complex (Fig. 6.11). 

The mafic and ulrramafic Canindé complex (Silva Filho 1976) is a 8km thick 
sequence consisting of mctabasites, meta-arkoses, quartzites, marbles and graphite 
phyllites, overlain by a major gabbroic-pyroxenitc unit. The complex is divided in four 
units having mostly a geochemistry of island arc-type volcanism (Blais et al. 1989, 
Bezerra et al. 1989,1990), but one particular unit has characteristics of intraplate basaltic 
mngmatism (Oliveira A Tarney 199(1). 

The Marancó Domain comprises highly sheared, greenschist to amphibolite 

facies, metarhyolites and mctadacites (80% of the surface), with minor meta-andesites, 

amphibolitcs, metapelitcs, volcanic-derived conglomerates and arkosic/lithic quartzites, 

metacarbonates, chloritites, and two concordant intrusive bodies of serpentinites. The 

Poço Redondo Domain consists of orthogneisses and paragneisses migmatized and 

injected by syn- and post-tectonic granites and granodiorites, and may represent 

reworked basement (Santos et al 1988; Davison &amp;amp; Santos 1989).

Thrust bell and foreland basin models 
The results of this research do not support the model of thrust belts and 

associated foreland basins (Beaumont 1981) which have been proposed for the mobile 

belt / fold belts around the São Francisco Craton (e.g. Pimentel et al. 1992). Such a 

model had been proposed and accepted for the origin of the Palmares sandstones (section 

2.8 &amp;amp; Fig. 2.9). 

The principal argument against this model is that the sediments on the craton are 

900 Ma in age (Misi 1976) and are laterally continuous with the sediments that now 

form the Sergipano Fold Belt (Fig. 6.3). These strata are therefore clearly older than the 

Brasiliano deformation, hence cannot have been deposited in a foreland basin setting as 

deformation developed. 

Moreover, the sedimentary characteristics of the Lagarto-Palmares sandstones 

(section 3.3.4 &amp;amp; Saes 1984) do not compare either with continental sedimentation 

described elsewhere ahead of thrust sheets (e.g. Gustavson 1974; Hirst &amp;amp; Nichols 1986; 

Nichols 1987) or ahead fault uplifted terranes (e.g. Wescott 1990, Wescott &amp;amp; Ethridge 

1990). Similarly, the stratigraphic succession formed by the Lagarto and Vaza Barris 

Groups (Fig. 6.3) does not compare with the marine sedimentation developed in 

foreland basins due to accretion of terranes into a passive margin, as interpreted for 

example in the evolution of the Appalachians and Cordilleran basins of North America 

(Tankard 1986). 

Tectonic model 

A tectonic model for the southern part of Sergipano Fold Belt is depicted in 

Figure 6.10. Figure 6.10 A shows the inferred architecture prior to D1 deformation 

whereby the Vaza Barris trough was the locus of deposition of the Palestina diamictites 

in a basin bounded by the Escarpa and Pelada faults. D1 deformation was characterised 

by southward directed tectonic transport with the development of large recumbent fold 

nappes and possibly thrust out lower limbs (Fig. 6.10 B). The penetrative, flat-lying S1 
foliation in the metasediments was developed at this time. The recumbent folds (and 

thrusts?) probably evolved from the hinterland of the orogen, to the north of the 

Mocambo fault. 

D2 deformation (Fig. 6.10 C) is interpreted to have been part of the same south 

vergent progressive deformation, resulting in bulk shortening of the section, penetrative 

S2 foliations and inversion of the original extensional faults, so that these thrusts link to 

the lower detachment (e.g. Fig. 6.9). The model indicates that the shortening and 

inversion along the Mocambo fault in the region of the Vaza Barris trough was greater 

than that in the vicinity of the Itabaiana dome (cf. sections in Fig. 6.9). 

This interpretation is supported by the geophysical data (Figs. 5.6-5.8) which 

indicate that the crystalline basement increases in depth from west to east. Possibly 

because of the Itabaiana dome, the D2 shortening was more intense across the Vaza 

Barris trough (note the narrowing of the outcropping area of the Palestina Formation 

between the Pelada and Escarpa faults. Fig. 6.8) and in consequence, the diamictites 

were possibly pushed out of the Vaza Barris trough Fig- 6.10 A). Such situation, which 

172 



is expected in inverted crestai collapse grabens (McClay &amp;amp; Buchanan 1991), matches 

with the greater amount of inversion of the Mocambo fault in this area. 

Strain measurements together with textural and fabric studies indicate that D2 
deformation was characterised by a sinistral strike-slip, transpressive regime (section 

4.8). This oblique contractional deformation is interpreted to have been responsible for 

the rotation of the Itabaiana dome (Fig. 6.6) at this stage, with the basement dome acting 

as a resistant rigid object that deflected strain trajectories around it 

The syn-D2 transpressive regime in the Itabaiana Dome Area reinforces the 

interpretation that the Sergipano Fold Belt probably resulted from the accretion of 

terranes during an oblique collision (Davison 1987; Santos et al. 1988; Davison &amp;amp; 

Santos 1989). Actually, oblique collision and the resultant transpressive tectonic regimes 

are a common feature during the accretion of allochthonous terranes to cratonic margins 

(Howell 1989). 

The lack of foreland basin sediments on the craton or within the frontal part of 

the Sergipano Fold Belt (i.e. clastic sediments derived from the fold belt rocks or in part 

from the craton (from the peripheral bulge) and undeformed by the Brasiliano orogeny) 

may be either a function of the present day erosion level, or a foreland basin may not 

have been developed at all. 

A tectonic model that does not necessitate the development of a significant 

foreland basin (Fig. 6.12) involves an accretionary wedge developed whereby the D 1 - D 2 
deformations built up a 10km-thick sequence on the attenuated cratonic margin (Fig. 

6.12 A) and the loading in the inner parts of the belt was accompanied by downwarping 

of the attenuated crust (Figs 6.12 B &amp;amp; C), so that the accretionary wedge did not develop 

significant relief above sea level and the thrusts did not encroach onto the craton. 

A similar argument was proposed by Tankard (1986) who cited COCORP 

geophysical data as evidence that a 14km-thick wedge when emplaced onto a 4-5km 

deep attenuated continental margin, did not create relief above sea-level, and hence the 

crust beneath the wedge must have been deflected downwards for approximately 10km. 

Fold belts with low topographic elevation and little denudation can also be generated at 

plate boundaries where the rate of subduction exceeds the rate of overall convergence 

(Royden &amp;amp; Burchfiel 1989), with the result that the pull-down compensates the uplift by 

thrusting, folding and magmatism. 

In the model of Figures 6.12 B and C the border of the São Francisco Craton 

probably underwent p o s t - D | orpost-D2 extension (cf. similar processes proposed by 

Houseknecht 1986 and Bradley &amp;amp; Kidd 1991). This may account for the Jacaré 

extensional fault in the cratonic area to the south of the Itaporanga fault (Fig. 6.1) and for 

the post-D| extension in the Capitão farm outcrop (section 4.7). 

Thus, a complex interplay between compressive and extensive stresses may have 

occurred simultaneously along some of the regional thrusts. Whereas post-contraction 

extension is a common feature in many orogens (Carl et al. 1991), extension 

contemporaneous to compression is being an increasingly recognised paradox in the 

literature of deformation belts (Waters 1991). 

173

probable flexural downwarping of the crust, and the lack of thrusting on the 
São Francisco craton. JF = Jacaré fault, IF = Itaporanga fault, SMAF = São 
Miguel do Aleixo fault, BMJF = Belo Monte-Jeremoabo fault. 

174 



This can account for descriptions of normal and thrust character in different 
places along the trace of the Itaporanga fault (Brito Neves et al. 1977 a) and can explain 
the isolated carbonate breccia in the southwestern corner of the study area (section 
4.4.2). The carbonate breccia may be the product of an extensional reactivation of the 
Itaporanga fault between highly folded Olhos D'água carbonates and relatively 
undeformed Lagarto sandstones (Fig. 6.12 C). 

If the model of Figure 6.12 is applicable, the lack of significant syn-tectonic 
erosion probably implies conservation of a thickened crustal pile (Fig. 6.12 C) probably 
for longer time than that predicted in PTt studies in other metamorphic bells (e.g. 
England &amp;amp; Richardson 1977; England &amp;amp; Thompson 1984; Thompson &amp;amp; England 1984; 
Thompson &amp;amp; Ridley 1987). This may cause differential rates of isotopic 
rehomogeneization of Sr at different parts of the belt, therefore the onset of the 
deformation may be older than the metamorphic ages suggested by Rb-Sr systems. 

The São Francisco Craton and the Sergipano Fold Belt 
In order to fully understand the tectonic evolution of the Sergipano Fold Belt its 

relationship to the São Francisco Craton must be examined. Figure 6.13 shows the São 
Francisco Craton with the surrounding fold belts, the Borborcma Province and the 
Pernambuco-Alagoas Massif. 

To the west of the Sergipano Fold Belt (Fig. 6.13) the Riacho do Pontal Fold 
Belt evolved in the 2100-1800Ma Transamazonic cycle (Jardim de Sá 1988; Jardim de 
Sá et al. 1988), and was reactivated in the Brasiliano cycle by the dcxtral Pernambuco 
Shear Zone (Gomes 1990). Further west, the 700-500Ma old Rio Preto Fold Belt keeps 
characteristics of an entirely intracratonic belt, and its crystalline basement was mostly 
formed during the Transamazonic cycle (Egidio da Silva et al. 1989, 1990). 

These data strongly suggest that the southwestern part of the Borborema 
Province and the São Francisco Craton were a single block since the Early Proterozoic. 
Porada (1989) proposed a continental bridge across the northern part of the São 
Francisco and Congo Cratons around 1100-l000Ma (Fig. 2.11 A). This feature may 
have extended further to the north between Brazil and Africa, and may have been formed 
as long ago as 2000 Ma, on the basis of structural, lithological and radiometric continuity 
between the two continents (Hurley et al. 1967; Torquato &amp;amp; Cordani 1981). 

Such a single land mass, grouping part of the Borborema Province, the São 
Francisco Craton and western Africa, is also in agreement with the long-lived 
Proterozoic supercontinent proposed by Piper (1976, 1987) on the basis of 
paleomagnetic data. Moreover an Early Proterozoic connection is also suggested by the 
possible continuity of the granulitic rocks of the São Francisco Craton, the Pernambuco-
Alagoas Massif and the Chailu massif of the Congo Craton (Brito Neves et al. 1977 a). 

Additional support is given by the unique geochemical similarities of the Early 
Proterozoic Caraiba and Serrote da Laje copper sulphide deposits (Lindenmayer 1980; 
D'el-Rey SUva 1985; D'el-Rey Silva et al. 1988; Horbach &amp;amp; Marimon 1988) - hosted by 
pyroxenites emplaced within high grade gneisses in the São Francisco Craton and in the 
Pernambuco-Alagoas Massif respectively (Horbach &amp;amp; Marimon 1988). 

175 



Figure 6.13 - Sketch map showing the São Francisco Craton and regional 
structural elements of the Brasiliano tectonic cycle used to interpret the 
evolution of the southern part of the Sergipano Basin. 

176 



Pre-Brasiliano extension of the margins of the São Francisco Craton have been 
described by Aikmin et al. (1990) in the Araçuai Fold Belt, in the Quadrilátero Ferrífero 
area and in the west and southern part of the Brasilia Fold Belt (Fig. 6.13). Thus, it can 
be concluded that syn-extensional depositional processes, similar to those proposed in 
this thesis for the Itabaiana Dome Area, have affected the margins of the São Francisco 
Craton during the Middle to Late Proterozoic. Such an evolution suggests that the São 
Francisco Craton underwent uplift and circumferal extension at this time (Fig. 6.13) and 
in particular the Sergipano Fold Belt evolved as an intracratonic basin on its western 
part, between what are now the Pernambuco-Alagoas Massif and the craton. 

The opening and closure of the Sergipano Basin 
A schematic model for the opening and closure of the Sergipano Basin is shown 

in Figure 6.14. This model incorporates the aspects of the geological evolution of the 
Sergipano Fold Belt (section 6.2), and also the relationships between the fold belt and 
the São Francisco Craton discussed above. Facies and thickness relationships (Chapter 3 
&amp;amp; section 6.2 above) indicate that the area in the vicinity of the Itabaiana dome was the 
locus of the depoccntre in the southern part of the Sergipano Basin. 

The few formations and their small thicknesses in the cratonic and pericratonic 
parts of the Sergipano Fold Belt, to the west of the Tucano Basin (Gava et al. 1983, 
Conceição Filho &amp;amp; Sales 1988) and the passage from lkm of cratonic sediments to 
4km of pericratonic sediments in the area of this thesis, point out to the Itabaiana Dome 

Area as the deepest depocentre in the southern part of the Sergipano Basin. 

These data indicate an asymmetric basin that deepens eastward and northward of 
a hypothetic point in the western pan of the São Francisco Craton (Fig. 6.14 A), 
reaching maximum depths in the northeast, where the eugeoclinal Macururé Group was 
deposited. The data also suggest oblique extension (or a combination of extension along 
directions subparallel to N-S and E-W) and migration of the depocenter towards the ENE 
(Fig. 6.13). The extensional fault activity appears to have propagated westwards from 
the vicinity of the Itabaiana dome during the early Itabaiana Formation time, to the 
locality of the Simão Dias dome, by the late Itabaiana Formation time. 

The model for the opening of the Sergipano Basin combines uplift of the central 
pan of the São Francisco Craton and oblique extensional delamination of its margins, 
along a low-angle basal detachment (Fig. 6.14 A). The lowest position of the detachment 
is speculative: by analogy with other areas (e.g. the Rhine Graben, Brun et al. 1991) it 
may have been within the upper-lower crust boundary, or alternatively the basal 
detachment may have gone to the base of the continental crust, as proposed for the 
Damara Fold Belt (Henri et al. 1990). 

The closure of the Sergipano Basin (Fig. 6.14 B) assumes the inversion along 
the main extensional detachment, as a result of the collision between the southern pan of 
the Borborema Province and the São Francisco Craton. The inversion of the basin was 
initially accomplished by a southward movement of trie Borborema Province into the São 
Francisco Craton developing the first phase of recumbent folding and low-angle 
thrusting toward south.

Because the Sergipano Basin was probably narrower, and the detachment was 
probably shallower in the western part of the basin as opposed to its eastern part, basin 
sediments were thrust onto the western part of the São Francisco Craton but did not 
occur further east (Fig. 6.14 B). 

In order to accommodate the continued convergence (probably oblique), the 
Pernambuco-Alagoas Massif started to move laterally toward the west, along the 
Pernambuco Shear Zone, creating a sinistral transpressive regime at the northern margin 
of the São Francisco Craton. This regime generated the asymmetric, SSW vergent F2 
folding and oblique slip thrust faults. High pore fluid pressures at this time facilitated the 
thrust emplacement (for example, as evidenced by the extensive quartz veining along the 
Pelada fault - Fig. 3.1, enclosure). 

Climbing the inclined ramp (Fig. 6.14 B) the Pernambuco-Alagoas Massif 
possibly underwent uplift between the Sergipano Fold Belt and the Borborema Province, 
as a consequence of the curve of the Pernambuco Shear Zone to the south, combined 
with the resistance offered by the western margin of the craton. A slight change in the 
direction of the compressive field between the western parts of the Pernambuco-Alagoas 
Massif and the São Francisco Craton, combined with the tooth-shaped margin of the 
basin (Fig. 6.14 A) can explain the dominant dextral strike-slip movement associated 
with the regional faults, similarly as proposed by Moraes et ai. (1987). 

The faults are postulated to flatten at depth and merge into a basal detachment 
(Fig. 6.14b). The northward verging thrusts and folds of the northernmost part of the 
Sergipano Fold Belt are interpreted as a positive flower structure - a feature typical of 
transpressive regimes (Odonne &amp;amp; Vialon 1983; Christie-Blick &amp;amp; Biddle 1985). Thus, the 
legacy of the Brasiliano orogeny was a conjugate set of zones of crustal weakness in the 
Sergipano Fold Belt. They seem to have played a critical role in controlling the Mesozoic 
rift system which cross-cuts the Sergipano Fold Belt (Milani &amp;amp; Davison 1988). 

6.4 - Implications for Proterozoic crustal evolution 

6.4.1 - Introduction 
The Sergipano Fold Belt can be described as a low to medium metamorphic 

grade, basement-involved, ductile fold and thrust belt. It is interpreted to have evolved 
by the inversion of an extensional half-graben fault system upon a low-angle basal 
detachment as a result of the oblique collision of the Pernambuco-Alagoas Massif with 
the São Francisco Craton during the 600 - 700Ma Brasiliano orogeny (Fig. 6.14). 

The fold belt is characterised by south-vergent polyphase folding and thrusting 
with an oblique slip component of deformation. Basement gneiss domes (Fig. 6.11) 
show strong evidence of ductile reworking of the crystalline basement during the 
Brasiliano orogeny. 

In the following sections the implications of this study for the understanding of 
Proterozoic stratigraphy, tectonic evolution, craton-mobile belt evolution and Proterozoic 
plate tectonics are discussed.

6.4.2 - Late Protero/.oic sequence stratigraphy 
Figure 6.15 highlights, in a pre-Mesozoic drift reconstruction of the South 

American and African continents, the Late Proterozoic Bambui Group sediments 
deposited in the center and margins of the São Francisco Craton, and the sediments 
equivalent to this group deposited in and around the Amazon, West African, Congo and 
Kalahari Cratons (Misi 1976). 

Figure 6.16 is a summary geological map of the São Francisco Craton. It 
consists of Archean and Early Proterozoic high grade granite-gneiss and granulitic 
terranes, greenstone belts and supra-crustal sequences. Between 1800-1400Ma ago, the 
craton underwent intracratonic rifting, which resulted in the Espinhaço Fold Belt and 
sedimentary cover. The craton has also extensive Late Proterozoic sediments (the 
Bambui Group and Macaúbas supra-crustals) and a Phanerozoic cover, such as that in 
the Tucano Basin (Teixeira &amp;amp; Figueiredo 1991). 

The Estância-Miaba Group is comprised of the lower siliciclastic megasequence 
(the Juetê-Itabaiana/Ribeirópolis Formations) and the lower carbonate megasequence (the 
Acauã-Jacoca Formation), and record the first sedimentary cycle (Cycle I) in the 
southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt 

Table 6.1 shows the part of the stratigraphy of the Sergipano Fold Belt and its 
equivalents - the Bambui Group around the São Francisco Craton. It can be seen that 
there are close correlations between the sequences in the Sergipano Fold Belt and strata 
in other fold belts around the craton. In the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt, the 
Bambui equivalent sediments have been divided into the Estância-Miaba Group, and the 
Lagarto Group (the Lagarto-Palmares Formation). Therefore the Bambui Group is here 
informally renamed Bambui Supergroup (Table 6.1). 

The Estância-Miaba Group forms the lower siliciclastic megasequence and the 
lower carbonate megasequence of cycle I in the Sergipano Fold Belt (Fig. 6.3). In other 
fold belts around the São Francisco Craton (Table 6.1) only the basal equivalents of the 
siliciclastic megasequence of Cycle II of the Sergipano Fold Belt (Fig. 6.3) are found, 
and the overlying Palestina diamictites and Olhos D'Agua carbonates have no 
stratigraphic correlatives. 

The elastics of the Bambui Group and in particular the diamictites reflect the 
uplift and erosion of the craton. In the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt the 
diamictites contain clasts of gneiss, granite and quartz (Juetê Formation) and clasts of 
gneiss, granite, quartz and quartzites (Ribeirópolis diamictites). All the diamictite units in 
other fold belts around the craton have similar clast assemblages and in addition clasts of 
carbonates, metasiltites, and metapelites (Karfunkell &amp;amp; Hoppe 1988; Egidio da Silva et 
ai. 1989). 

These assemblages indicate erosion of the cratonic basement and also Middle 
Proterozoic sediments (e.g. Rio Preto, Araçuai, and Brasilia Fold Belts). The Juetê 
diamictites therefore reflect the erosion of the basement, in an area where Middle 
Proterozoic sediments are not recorded (Fig. 6.16). The Ribeirópolis diamictites reflect 
the erosion of both the basement and Itabaiana quartzites.

184 



It should also be noted that the carbonate megasequence (Acauã equivalent) of the 
Bambui Group in all these belts is overlain by a coarsening-upward siliciclastic sequence 
equivalent to the Lagarto-Palmares Formation (Table 6.1). These siliciclastic sequences 
have similar petrographic characteristics (Saes 1984; Egidio da Silva et al. 1989; Uhlein 
et al. 1990), and may indicate progressively greater uplift in the centre of the craton 
(Figs. 6.13 &amp;amp; 6.16) by the time of the deposition of the Lagarto-Palmares Formation. 

This discussion indicates that with more detailed stratigraphic and 
sedimentological analyses of the other fold belts surrounding the São Francisco Craton. 
may be possible to reconstruct the erosional history of the craton and hence to investigate 
in more detail the hypothesis of uplift and circumferal extension proposed here. 

Palestina Diamictites 
The Palestina diamictites and the overlying Olhos D'Agua carbonates are 

important stratigraphic units of the Sergipano Fold Belt and can be closely matched with 
the stratigraphy of the West Congo and Damara Fold Belts (Table 6.2). The similarities 
in sedimcntology and sequence stratigraphy of these belts implies a strong pre-Brasiliano 
linkage. 

In particular the correlation of the Palestina diamictites with a major period of 
extension matches with similar interpretation for the Chuos diamictites of the Damara 
Fold Belt (Table 6.2) which have been interpreted as the record of continental break-up 
and opening of the Khomas Sea between the Congo and Kalahari Cratons (Fig. 6.17; 
Henri et al. 1990). The Pan-African South Atlantic ocean (Fig. 6.17) has been postulated 
in order to explain the incompleteness of the West Congo Fold Belt (another rift should 
have existed to the west but is now probably hidden by the Atlantic ocean). This 
probably existed 1100 to 750Ma ago, between the southern São Francisco Craton and 
the Congo Craton, but did not entirely separate the two continents (Porada 1989). 

Therefore the Sergipano Basin may have evolved into a small, E-W trending 
ocean (here termed the Canindé sea) in the northeastern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt at 
this time. This hypothesis does not conflict with the concept of a Proterozoic 
supercontinent (Piper 1987) as the amount of craton separation would have been too 
small to be delected by paleomagnetic methods (Briden 1976; Shackleton 1986). 

6.4.3 - Late Proterozoic tectonic evolution 
The Sergipano Fold Belt is characterised by ductile reworking of the crystalline 

basement and by south-southwest vergent folding and and thrusting, with some north 
vergent folds and thrust in the Macurure Domain (Fig. 6.14 B). 

Ductile reworking of crystalline basement is common in many other fold belts, 
such as the Early Proterozoic Aravalli of India (Nalia &amp;amp; Mohanty 1989), the Grenville 
Front of Canada (Brown et al. 1991), the Late Proterozoic Tusas Mountains, USA 
(Williams 1991), and the Caledonian Fold-Thrust Belt of NW Scotland (Holdsworth 
1989, 1990). 

The internal structure of the Sergipano Fold Belt also compares well with other 
fold belts where progressive shortening by folding and thrusting has led to steepening of 

185

Lagarto Group (this study), and has no correspondent in the other belts surrounding the São Francisco Craton (see table 6.1).

the thrusts together with locking-up of the system and transpressional deformation. A 

similar tectonic history has been interpreted for the Areachap Group of South Africa 

(Donker 1990.) and for the southeastern Australian Fold Belt (Wang &amp;amp; White 1990). The 

D1-D2 shortening of 75% across the fold belt (calculated in Fig. 6.9 A by line-length 

balance along bedding in the Olhos D'Água carbonates between the ltaporanga fault and 

point B) is comparable with other similar orogens that have resulted from collision (e.g. 

Daly 1986; Gray et al. 1991). 

The tectonic characteristics of the Sergipano Fold Belt are very similar to those 

described for other Proterozoic fold belts in Brazil (Hasui &amp;amp; Costa 1990; Corsini et al. 

1991), including those surrounding the São Francisco Craton (e.g. Campos Neto &amp;amp; 

Figueiredo 1990; Egidio da Silva et al. 1990; Gomes 1990; Schrank et al. 1990; Soares 

ei al. 1990). The tectonic model of an inverted extensional half-graben (section 6.3 

above) also agrees with similar models evoked to explain the sedimentary and structural 

asymmetry in Pan-African-Brasiliano fold belts and related basins (e.g. Henry et al. 

1990; Krebs et al. 1990), 

The majority of these fold belts have ductilely reworked crystalline basement, a 

high grade metamorphic axial zone, a double vergence of folds and thrusts both towards 

the foreland and towards the hinterland, and transpressive or strike-slip related 

deformation, as in the Damara Fold Belt (Henri et al. 1990) 

6.4.4 - Craton - Mobile Belt evolution 
The deposition of Late Proterozoic coarsening upwards siliciclastic sequences on 

top of the carbonates of the Bambui Group and equivalents indicate a radial dispersal 

pattern outwards from a central high within the São Francisco Craton (Fig. 6.16). This 

pattern may be interpreted to indicate domal uplift in the central part of the craton during 

the period of extensional tectonics that formed the precursor basins that surround the 

craton (Fig. 6.13). 

The sedimentary basins which later formed the fold belts, appear to have been 

generated by circumferal extension at the margins of the updomed São Francisco Craton. 

Uplift of cratons, extension with onset of rift systems and continental break-up are being 

increasingly associated with the rising of mantle plumes in the asthenosphere (e.g. White 

&amp;amp; Mackenzie 1989; Kent 1991; Thompson &amp;amp; Gibson 1991). It can be postulated that the 

São Francisco Craton and its ring of marginal basins could be part of a long-lived, large-

scale core complex-like evolution, which may have started following the Archean to 

Early Proterozoic periods of craton assembly. 

The Middle-Late Proterozoic circumferal extension may be the end product of the 

uplift of the older mountain chains in the craton and exposure of their granulitic roots, 

similarly to the Basin and Range model of post-orogenie extension (Malavieille &amp;amp; 

Taboada 1991). This hypothesis agrees with predictions that the exposure of g r a n u l e s 

in Archean-Early Proterozoic terranes has probably required a faster denudation than just 

erosion could provide (Thompson &amp;amp; England 1984). The presence of voluminous 

granites in these terranes suggest deep crustai igneous activity increasing the heat supply 

and provoking uplift and erosion (Thompson &amp;amp; Ridley 1987). The Brasiliano-age 

88 



granites intruding the São Francisco Craton (Mascarenhas et al. 1984) may also be 

evidence of a deep seated heat source. 

According to this model, the sedimentary cycle I of the Sergipano Fold Belt is 

associated with a progressive uplift of the centre of the São Francisco Craton and initial 

extension of its margins. In cycle II, the upper siliciclastic megasequence is associated 

with a progressively faster uplift of the centre of the craton coupled with a major rifting 

event in the basin, attributable to the unloading of the centre of the craton and opening of 

the Canindé sea. The upper carbonate megasequence records the post-rift sedimentation 

in the basin. 

The applicability of this model to the other Pan-African-Brasiliano cratons and 

belts (Fig. 6.15) is strongly supported by the similarities of the tectonic evolution of the 

São Francisco and Congo Cratons (Teixeira &amp;amp; Figueiredo 1991) and by the 

correspondence between the Bambui Group with the craton-belt Late Proterozoic 

sediments deposited around the Amazon, West African, Congo, and Kalahary Cratons 

(Misi 1976). 

The closure of the basins which are now (together with basement slices and 

gneiss domes) incorporated into the Brasiliano age fold belts that surround the São 

Francisco Craton, is generally accepted to have occurred by collisional tectonics (Couto 

1984; Davison &amp;amp; Santos 1989; Jones 1989). In the case of the Sergipano Fold Belt 

collision between the Borborema Block - Pernambuco Alagoas Massif to the north and 

the São Francisco Craton to the south is believed to have generated the fold belt (section 

6.3 above). 

The models which have been invoked for the other fold belts that surround the 

São Francisco Craton assume the closure of intracratonic basins (Egidio da Silva et al. 

1990), or episodes of A-subduction (Campos Neto et al. 1990; Heilbron 1990) or even 

the closure of small oceanic basins by collision of continental fragments or island arcs 

against the craton (Soares et al. 1990; Brito Neves &amp;amp; Cordani 1991). 

In the cases of intracratonic basins, closure may have simply involved the return 

of extended continental crust to more normal thicknesses whereas in the case of small 

oceans subduction of oceanic lithosphere would have occurred. In the latter case 

identification of oceanic crustal rocks, high P / Low T metamorphism and melanges 

would be needed to identify paleosuture zones. 

The characteristics of the Sergipano Fold Belt, such as the double vergence of 

folds and thrusts, an axial zone with intermediate pressure and temperature 

metamorphism, the slightly higher metamorphic pressures in its northernmost parts 

(Jardim de Sá et al. 1981), and the inferred suture along the line of the Canindé Complex 

(Fig. 6.11), are comparable with the Damara and North Equatorial Fold Belts, where the 

closure of small oceans and suture zones have also been interpreted (Henri et al. 1990; 

Kukla &amp;amp; Stanistreet 1991; Nzenti et al. 1988). 

The probable characteristics of the Sergipano Basin (Fig. 6.14 A) and the unique 

combination of the Palestina diamictites with the Canindé, Marancó and Poço Redondo 

Domains implies that in, the Sergipano Fold Belt, the asymmetric basin passed along its 

axis from an western intracratonic setting into an eastern oceanic setting (Fig. 6.18). 

189 



Figure 6.18 - Cartoon illustrating the opening of the Canindé sea, and its 
relationship with an asymmetric, continental crust-floored basin on its western end. 

190 



The consumption of the Canindé sea in the tectonic evolution of the Sergipano 

Fold Belt (Table 6.3) can explain the island arc signature and the emplacement of the 

major units of the Canindé complex, by subduction of oceanic crust underneath oceanic 

crust, and by collage of this arc onto the passive margin of the Pernambuco-Alagoas 

Massif. In a later stage, another arc (the Marancó Domain) possibly resulted from 

northward subduction of oceanic crust underneath the northern passive margin (Table 

6.3) or under deforming continental crust. Hall (1987) and Wilson (1989) point out that 

although andesitic suites result from subduction of oceanic crust under continental or 

oceanic crusts, dacitic and rhyolitic suites (such as the Marancó Domain) are more 

common in the former than in the latter situation. 

Both the Marancó and Poço Redondo Domains may have been emplaced at the 

beginning of the collisional stage (sensu of Shackleton 1986) and this may also explain 

the position of the Poço Redondo Domain within the Canindé and Marancó Domains in 

the map (Fig. 6.11). However, as Davison &amp;amp; Santos (1989) pointed out, the late stage 

transcurrent movement may have erased most of the evidence of movements other than 

lhe F-W sinistral shear, along the boundary between these domains. 

The calcalkalinc-alkaline granites intruded in the northern part of the Sergipano 

Fold Belt are co-genetic and can be explained by partial melting of the lower crust and 

upper mantle (Giuliani &amp;amp; Santos 1988). However, as the granodiorites of Coronel João 

Sá and most of the major bodies (Fig. 6.11) are late- to p o s t - D 2 deformation (Santos el 

al. 1988; Davison &amp;amp; Santos 1989) they cannot have been pan of pre-collisional arcs, as 

postulated by Fujimori (1989). Because the position of these granites within the 

Macururé Domain requires a southward subduction of oceanic crust underneath the São 

Francisco Craton, of which there is no evidence, a simple model of partial melting of a 

tectonically-thickened and garnet-rich lower crust (Table 6.3) is preferred here. 

Although the tectonic evolution outlined above adds weight to the concept that the 

Canindé, Marancó and Poço Redondo Domains might be allocthonous (Davison &amp;amp; 

Santos 1989), the definite acceptance of such a terrane model requires detailed 

paleomagnetic and age studies of the three domains relative to the rest of the Sergipano 

Fold Belt. 

6.4.5 - Implications for Proterozoic orogens and Plate T e c t o n i c 

The stratigraphic connections between the São Francisco Craton, Sergipano Fold 

Belt and the Congo and Kalahari Cratons are illustrated in Figure 6.17, Tables 6.1 and 

6.2. In particular the outcrops of the diamicutes of these areas are highlighted. 

In the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt, diamictites occur in the cratonic 

Juetê Formation (Saes 1984), in the Ribeirópolis and Palestina Formations (Tables 6.1 &amp;amp; 

6.2). Around the São Francisco Craton, diamictites have been described in the basal 

section of the Bambui Group (Table 6.1 &amp;amp; Fig. 6.17); in the Canabravinha Formation of 

the Rio Preto Fold Belt (Egidio da Silva et al. 1989); in the Bebedouro Formation of the 

Lençóis Basin, in the Jequitai Formation of the Araçuai Fold Belt, in the São João D'el-

Rey Group at the southernmost end of the craton, and in the Ibiii Formation (or Jequitai 

Formation) of the Brasilia Fold Belt (Kaifunkel &amp;amp; Hoppe 1988). 

191 



T a b l e 6.3 - S u m m a r y of t h e tectonic e v o l u t i o n of t h e S e r g i p a n o F o l d Belt. 

192 



In the West Congo and Damara Fold Belts (Fig. 6.17 &amp;amp; Tabic 6.2) diamictites are 

found in the Lower and Upper Tilloid Formations (Schermerhorn &amp;amp; Stanton 1963; 

Coward 1981a; Schermerhorn 1981) and in the Chuos Formation (Henri et al. 1990) 

respectively. The very similar stratigraphic relationships emphasised above therefore 

indicate similar tectonic histories of basin formation and extension. 

There has been considerable debate as to whether the basins that are now 

incorporated into these Proterozoic fold belts were formed as intracratonic or oceanic 

basins (Kroner 1983; Windley 1987). For example the Proterozoic fold belts of Australia 

are thought to be largely intracratonic in nature (Preiss 1987; White 1989). 

Porada (1989) and Brito Neves &amp;amp; Cordani (1991) consider that, although many 

of the Pan-African-Brasiliano belts are intracratonic, some may have formed from 

oceanic basins. Murphy &amp;amp; Nance (1990, 1991) considered the Late Proterozoic fold 

belts throughout the world as evidence of cnistal accretion and dispersal of a Proterozoic 

supercontinent. They classified the belts into internal and external orogens. 

The interior orogens (e.g. Pan-African-Brasiliano fold belts), were related to the 

destruction of interior oceans and with supercontinent amalgamation. The external 

orogens (e.g. Avalonian-Cadomian belt of North America and western Europe, and the 

Arabian shield) were related to the destruction of wide oceans peripheral to the 

supercontinent. Subduction probably started everywhere by SOOMa ago, but each of the 

orogens evolved differently (Murphy &amp;amp; Nance 1990, 1991). 

In this model the internal belts culminated in continent-continent collision 650-

600Ma ago, producing abundant calcalkaline magmatiSOT, crustal thickening, regional 

thrusting and nappe development, together with the erosion of the mountain chains and 

cratonic sedimentation (Murphy &amp;amp; Nance 1991). At the margins of the supercontinent, 

oblique subduction and closure of the wide oceans generated the peripheral fold belts, 

and produced widespread volcanism and synorogenic volcanoclastic sediments (=-600Ma 

ago). 

In the Proterozoic of South America, Brito Neves &amp;amp; Cordani (1991) recognised 

both marginal and 'internar fold belts. The marginal belts consist of probable passive 

margin sedimentary and volcanic sequences thrust onto large continental blocks during 

collisions) events. The internal orogenies (e.g. the northern part of the Sergipano Fold 

Belt) consist of flysch-type volcano-sedimentary wedges, and occur within smaller 

blocks, and also in branching fold belt systems. They probably originated as continental 

rifts, small oceans, or back-arc basins. 

In order to account for the architecture of the fold belts around the São Francisco 

Craton Couto (1984) proposed a model of radial cnistal extension that separated the São 

Francisco, Amazon, Paraná, Congo, West African and Kalahari Cratons (Fig. 2.11 B), 

followed by crustal shortening and convergence towards lhe São Francisco Craton. 

The Pan-African-Brasiliano fold belts probably represent the closure of a basin 

system established within the Proterozoic supercontinent, about 1100- lOOOMa ago and 

having an architecture very similar to the North Atlantic Mesozoic rift system (Fig. 6.19; 

Porada 1989). The evidence indicates that some of these basins were intracratonic

(Egidio da Silva et al. 1990; Uhlein et ai. 1990). but some may have evolved into 

narrow internal oceans (e.g. this study; Henri et al. 1990; Soares et ai. 1990). 

The above suggests that in the closure of asymmetric basins similar to the 

Sergipano Basin (Fib. 6.18), subduction zones involving oceanic crust (B-subduction) 

passes axially into inverted extensional detachments of adjacent intracratonic basins, or 

alternatively into processes of A-subduction (Bally 1981). A modern analogue of this 

passage is postulated for the Tertiary evolution of the South China and Sulu seas 

(Howell 1989), whereas Shacklcton (1986) argues that A-subduction settings are 

probably derivative from previous B-subduction processes. 

Figure 6.20 shows some Late Proterozoic tectonic features which resulted from 

the closure of the original rift system. The combined result of many researches (see 

references in Fig. 6.20) is showing that the São Francisco Craton was probably 

subducted underneath the Pernambueo-Alagoas Massif and Paraná Craton, but overrides 

the West Congo Craton, which in turn overrides the Kalahari Craton to the south (Fig. 

6.20). 

This complex pattern of intracontinental deformation is further complicated if 

several smaller cratonic blocks which occur around the São Francisco Craton (as in Fig. 

2 of Brito Neves &amp;amp; Cordani 1991) are considered. For example, the recently 

characterised Transamazonic-age rigid block described to the southeast of the São 

Francisco Craton (see 7, Fig. 6.20), could be either a continuation of the Angola Craton 

(Zimbres et al. 1990), or a continuation of the Rio de La Plata Craton. 

Strike-slip movements along the Transbrasiliano, Senador Pompeu, Pernambuco 

and Paraiba crustal-scale shear zones, and other smaller faults to the south of the São 

Francisco Craton have further added to the tectonic complexity (Fig. 6.20). 

Taken together, all of these movements strongly suggest a pattern of 

intracontinental deformation accommodated by rotation of crustal blocks and the 

development of widespread mylonitic zones. Such movement patterns are expected to be 

within the limits of the Proterozoic paleomagnetic data (Briden 1976), and have been 

incorporated in a model of a fluid-chanellised Proterozoic mega-mylonitic crust (Katz 

1982). The connection of the Patos shear with the tectonic evolution of the Seridó Fold 

Belt (Fig. 6.20; Corsini et al. 1991) is an example possibly similar to this process. 

The polycyclic evolution of many of these Brazilian and African Late Proterozoic 

Fold Belts (e.g. Ribeiro et al. 1990; Gomes 1990; Corsini et al. 1991) implies that these 

cyclic events occurred at essentially the same locations. Nance et al. (1988) postulated 

that Proterozoic plate tectonics was governed by a regular cyclical process of continuous 

disaggregation and amalgamation of a Proterozoic supercontinent along the same tectonic 

zones. 

These authors consider heat as the primary engine of this process, and heat 

diffusion through the continental crust as the key for its understanding. Cox (1991) 

suggested a causal relationship between the upwelling of mantle plumes, continental 

break-up and the mechanisms which trigger subduction. If so, this process will have 

also to account for other complexities of the system, such as the anomalous tectonic 

transport of some fold belts, as the Rio Pardo (Fig. 6.19), the Australian Lachlan Fold 

1 9 6 



Belt (Gray et al. 1991) and the Paraguai Fold Belt (Alvarenga 1990) of the eastern 
margin of the Amazon Craton (see 8, Fig. 2.11 A). 

Davison &amp;amp; Santos (1989) showed the difficulties in correlating mobile zones 
between Brazil and Africa (Fig. 6.20) because fold belts with very similar lithologies 
have different directions of tectonic transport, such that found for the Sergipano and 
West Congo Fold Belts (and Nadjolé schists) which may be part of a triple junction near 
Libreville. They also proposed the correlation between the Rio Preto, Sergipano and 
North Equatorial Fold Belts (Fig. 6.20). The correlation with the latter fold belt is 
reinforced because it shows sedimentation continuous from the craton to the mobile, and 
has a similar metamorphic zoning, although the axial zone contains granulitcs formed at 

T=750°-800° and P=10-12kbar (Nzenti et al. 1988). 

Oldow et al. (1991) argued that transcurrent and thrust faults merge into the basal 
detachment, in virtually all fold belts, thus orogens float above subhorizontal zones of 
ductile flow in the lower crust (or above upper mantle detachments). They pointed out 
variations in the tectonic transport within an orogen may be due to relative motions of 
thrust sheets above the basal detachment. If so, different tectonic transport directions of 
Proterozoic fold belts (Fig. 6.20) may be due to the practically simultaneous collision of 
several continental blocks. An understanding of such a process may rest on the role 
mande plumes (=heat) to govern the movement of fluids within the lithosphere. 

If Late Proterozoic rifts and fold belts are governed by mantle plumes, triple and 
cuspate junctions of fold belts should be common and fold belts associated with different 
cratons will have similar stratigraphic and tectonic histories, as a result of the similarity 
of the processes that control basin formation and closure. Understanding the 
stratigraphic and tectonic evolution of Sergipano Fold Belt is a key to unravelling the 
Proterozoic history of the São Francisco Craton and the Proterozoic supercontinent.

Chapter 7 - Conclusions 

This chapter presents the conclusions of this PhD thesis together with 
recommendations for further research in the Sergipano Fold Belt and São Francisco 
Craton, of northeastern Brazil. 

1. The Itabaiana Dome Area surrounds the Itabaiana and Simão Dias gneiss 
domes, in the southern pan of the Sergipano Fold Belt. This is where basement-contact 
stratigraphic and structural relationships are best preserved in the Pan-African-Brasiliano 
orogenic system in Brazil. 

2. A new stratigraphy has been erected for the southern part of the Sergipano 
Fold Belt. Correlations can be made from the craton into the fold belt. Details of the 
stratigraphy are summarised below. 

3. The sedimentary record of the Itabaiana Dome Area and the southern part of 
the Sergipano Fold Belt has been divided in two sedimentary cycles, each consisting of 
two megasequences. Cycle I consists of the laterally continuous Estância and Miaba 
Groups. Cycle II consists of the Lagarto and Vaza Barris Groups. The sedimentation is 
probably 1100-900Ma old. 

4. The 300m-thick Estância Group is comprised of the Juetê and Acauã 
Formations. The 1000m-thick Miaba Group consists of the Itabaiana, Ribeirópolis and 
Jacoca Formations. 

5. The Estância-Miaba Group consists of the Juetê-Itabaiana, Ribeirópolis and 
Acauã-Jacoca Formations. The Juetê-Itabaiana quartzites, mudstones, minor 
conglomerates and diamictites, together with the Ribeirópolis phyllites, pebbly phyllites, 
diamictites and metavolcanics, form the siliciclastic megasequence of cycle I. The 
Acauã-Jacoca carbonates form the carbonate megasequence of cycle I. 

6. The 700m-3000m-fhick Lagarto Group was deposited both on the craton and 
in the basin and consists of the Lagarto-Palmares, Jacaré and Frei Paulo Formations. 
The basinal, 2000m-thick Vaza Barris Group comprises the Palestina and Olhos D'água 
Formations. The Lagarto Group siliciclastics and the Palestina diamictites and pebbly 
phyllites, form the siliciclastic megasequence of cycle II. The Olhos D'agua carbonates 
form the carbonate megasequence of cycle II. 

7. These miogeoclinal sediments record a continental to shallow marine 
sedimentation, with fault-bounded and localised deep-water basins (Vaza Barris trough). 
The basins appear to have been controlled by syndepositional extensional faulting and 
uplift of cratonic blocks at their margins.

8. The structure of the Itabaiana Dome Area is dominated by SW vergent 

recumbent F1 folds which are coaxially refolded by SW vergent, upright to reclined F2 

folds and cut by steep, oblique-slip D2 thrust faults developed in a sinistral transpressive 

deformation. Late stage, small scale F3 folds, kinks and the associated minor strike-slip 

faults indicate orogen-parallel contraction and extension. These three ductile to ductile-

brittle deformational phases ( D 1 D 3 ) affected both the metasediments and the basement 

gneisses. 

9. D1 structures are a layer-parallel S1 foliation and generally rootless, southward 

verging, WNW-ESE trending and up to 35km wavelength recumbent F1 folds. These 

may be associated with low-angle thrusts and are coaxially refolded by F2 folds. 

10. D2 structures are open to tight, gently inclined to upright, WNW-ESE 

trending, and generally southerly verging F2 folds. These folds have a penetrative 

pressure solution-type S2 axial planar foliation, and subhorizontal fold axes parallel to a 

penetrative stretching lineation. F2 folds are associated with WNW-ESE trending, 

sinistral oblique, steeply dipping faults, many of which are probably inverted extensional 

faults. 

11. D3 structures are transversal, open to tight, generally upright, kink-style, 

subhorizontal to subvertical folds, crenulations and kink bands. The F3 folds are 

generally associated with a steep-dipping, NE-SW trending, spaced cleavage. 

12. The Itaporanga fault separates the almost undeformed and unmetamorphosed 

cratonic domain to the south, from the deformed area consisting of the regional, Simão 

Dias, Itabaiana, west and east structural domains. 

13. In the deformed area, the WNW-ESE trend of the S2 and L2 features in the 

regional, Simão Dias and Itabaiana structural domains change to NNW-SSE trend in the 

west and east domains, respectively to the west and east of the Itabaiana dome. F2 folds 

are generally more open in the Itabaiana, west and east structural domains, than in the 

regional and Simão Dias domains. 

14. Deformation is attributed to a polyphase, progressive monocyclic event of 

basin inversion associated with sub-greenschist metamorphism and tectonic transport of 

the metasedimentary wedge of the southern part of the Sergipano Basin towards the São 

Francisco Craton. 

15. D1 records layer-parallel shearing and N-S shortening, with duplication of 

the stratigraphy. D2 records ENE-SSW shortening together with upward and E-W, out-

of-section movements in a transpressive tectonic regime. The D 1 -D 2 total shortening is 

estimated at around 7 5 % . D3 records a minor and late-stage event of orogen-parallel 

shortening and extension.

16. The Itabaiana and Simão Dias gneiss domes were progressively developed 
by superposition of D1 and D2 deformations and occupy the core of overturned F2 
folds. 

17. The Itabaiana dome probably underwent a syn-D2, top down to the west 

extension, developing a phyllonitic zone sub-parallel to the basal unconformity in the 

western margin of the dome. It also probably underwent a late-D2 counterclockwise 

rotation of 25° about a vertical axis. 

18. The thick Itabaiana quartzites which surround the Itabaiana dome probably 
acted as a barrier to D2 deformation. The quartzites of the eastern margin of the dome 
are affected by generally NW-SE trending and subvertical shear zones, whereas those in 
the western margin are affected by open F2 folds. 

19. The Sergipano Fold Belt comprises three WNW-ESE trending, fault-
separated but probably lithologically and structurally continuous domains. These are 
from south to north - the cratonic Estância Domain, the miogeoclinal Miaba/Vaza Barris 
Domain, and the eugeoclinal Macururé Domain. 

20. The evolution of the Sergipano Fold Belt is interpreted to have resulted from 
the inversion of a half graben above a low-angle detachment of a listric fault system 
within the continental crust. The original basin probably passed axially to a small 
oceanic setting on its northeastern side. 

21. The architecture of the whole Sergipano Fold Belt can be interpreted as a 
positive flower structure formed by the oblique collision between the Borborema 
Province and the São Francisco Craton. 

22. Thrust belt-foreland basin and post-orogenic sedimentation models do not 
explain the cratonic sedimentation of the southern part of the Sergipano Fold Belt. A 
model combining tectonic loading with downwarpingof an attenuated cratonic margin is 
proposed in order to account for the lack of foreland basin in this part of the belt. 

23. The sequence stratigraphy of the Sergipano Fold Belt compares well with the 
sedimentary record of the other Brasiliano belts surrounding the São Francisco Craton, 
and also with other Pan-African belts around the Congo and Kalahari Cratons of Africa. 

24. The evolution of the Middle-Late Proterozoic basins developed around the 
São Francisco Craton may have been the expression of the rise of a mantle plume 
underneath the craton. This model may be extended to other Pan-African and Brasiliano 
cratons such as the Amazon, West African, Congo, and Kalahari Cratons.

25. Proterozoic crustal processes of basin opening and closure may be related to 
the evolution of mantle plumes. Proterozoic Plate Tectonics appears to have been 
governed by a cyclic process of supercontinent fragmentation and amalgamation along 
long-lived lines of lithospheric weakness. 

Suggestions for further research in the Sergipano Fold Belt and the São Francisco 
Craton are as follows -

27. Field and/or geochronological evidence is required for the age of the 
Macambira phyllonites in the Itabaiana Dome Area. Such data may support the core 
complex hypothesis for the extension of the margin of the São Francisco Craton. 

28. Detailed studies of the basement-cover relationships around the Jirau do 
Ponciano gneissic dome are recommended for definition of the tectonic transport during 
D1 deformation in the Macururé Domain. 

29. Detailed structural, metamorphic, paleomagnetic and age studies are 

recommended for the understanding of the affinities and mode of emplacement of the 

Canindé, Marancó and Poço Redondo Domains, as they may be suspect or 

allochthonous terranes. 

30. Isotopic studies of the U-Pb and/or K-Ar systems across the Sergipano Fold 
Belt and its southern and northern cratonic margins, are recommended in order to 
understand the post-tectonic uplift of different segments of the belt. 

3 1 . More detailed studies are required on the syndepositional and possible 
extensional control of the sedimentation and lithofacies variations in the cratonic-
pericratonic areas of the Rio Preto, Brasilia and Araçuai Fold Belts, in order to 
reconstruct the Pre-Brasiliano vertical movements of the São Francisco Craton. 

32. An integrated tectono-stratigraphy is required for the marginal basins of the 

São Francisco Craton, in order to account for the stratigraphic evidence in the Sergipano 

Fold Belt. This could be a guide for similar studies around other cratons of the Pan-

African-Brasiliano orogenic system. 

33. Detailed structural analysis is required in key areas of the São Francisco 

Craton, in order to look for evidence of post-orogenic extension in the Early Proterozoic 

fold belts in the craton.

Appendix 

This appendix is comprised of three parts (A1-A3): 

Appendix A1 contains additional information on the stratigraphy of the 

Itabaiana Dome Area (Chapter 3). It includes a reduced geological map with 

location of the 12 stratigraphic section constructed around the Itabaiana and 

Simão Dias domes (A1.1) and seven of these stratigraphic sections (A1.2-

A1.8). 

Appendix A2 contains measurement of axis of clasts and clasts + tail 

from Palestina Formation rocks in outcrops and thin sections. These data 

(A2.1-A2.3) form the base for the strain analysis of section 4.4.4 . 

Appendix A3 contains observed and calculated gravity and 

magnetometric data, as well as density data of rocks in the Itabaiana Dome 

area. These data (A3.1-A3.4) form the base for the geophysical 

interpretations of section 5.5 .

ratios are shown. The ratios in bold were taken for the 
estimative of the strain ellipse using the methods derived by 
Flynn (1962, 1965) and Hsu (1966). The results are shown in 
Figure 4.12 A-B.
