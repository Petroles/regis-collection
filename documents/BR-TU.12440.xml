ABSTRACT 

Since the start of the industrial revolution (XVIII century), atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide 

(CO2) have been rising at a far greater rate than previously experienced, increasing CO2 dissolved in 

seawater. This process is recognized as ocean acidification and can severely damage calcifying 

organisms. Since echinoderms have an endoskeleton composed of magnesium calcite, they are 

predicted to be a sensitive taxa affected by this acidic environment. Taking into account that some 

species of this filo have a faster regeneration capacity under low pH, analysis of the proteome 

represents a powerful tool to examine these physiological trait at a molecular level. Trying to 

strengthen this work on ocean acidification effects, we studied Asterias rubens’ behaviour by 

observing their preference in choosing a leading arm when submitted to different regeneration time-

points (non-regeneration and regeneration after 1, 4, 9 and 14 days) and at two pH environments 

(control (CpH) – 8.1 and low (LpH) – 7.7). It was concluded that they do not have a preference leading 

arm before ablation in both pH environments. Although, one day after ablation they drastically 

decrease the use of the wounded arms, as expected, while the non-amputated arms did not suffer 

any changes. Furthermore, after nine days subjected to these conditions, it seems that sea stars 

recovered completely the movement of the amputated arms. Asterosaponins search was also a vital 

part of this work, since they are known for having important functions in sea stars. We observed that 

two of the nine asterosaponins detected in the control pH were also detected in low pH samples, and 

that their concentration decreased, suggesting that acidic pH may alter their biosynthesis. Proteins 

from both cell-free coelomic fluid (CFF) and radial nerve cord (RNC) were extracted, digested and 

further analyzed by nano LC-MS/MS. We were able to identify 298 proteins, being 81% of all proteins 

identified differentially expressed. A surprising finding was the almost absence of stress proteins in 

an acidic pH environment.  

In this work, we propose a correlation between an acidic environment and asterosaponins’ 

biological effects. The decline in diversity and amount of these biomolecules can be caused by 

already known decreases in respiratory rate and cholesterol absorption. Although, asterosaponins 

might have positive effects in predation and reproduction. The detected increase in vitellogenin 

expression seems to be associated with the amplified spawning event induced by the low levels of 

asterosaponins at acidic pH, thereby also enhancing reproduction.

RESUMO 

Desde o início da revolução industrial (século 18) que os níveis atmosféricos de dióxido de 

carbono (CO2) têm aumentado a um ritmo nunca antes registado (de 280ppm para 380ppm, e 

espera-se que duplique no final do século), essencialmente devido à emissão de gases com efeito de 

estufa resultantes de atividades humanas. Como consequência, a concentração de CO2 dissolvido nos 

oceanos também aumenta, e por sua vez, também a concentração de iões hidrogénio e iões 

bicarbonato, conduzindo a uma diminuição de pH e de iões carbonato. Este conjunto de reações é 

designado por acidificação dos oceanos, e pode danificar seriamente o funcionamento de 

organismos marinhos que de alguma forma utilizam o processo de biocalcificação na sua estrutura 

corporal. Os equinodermes possuem um endosqueleto composto por calcite de magnésio, têm uma 

extraordinária capacidade de regeneração, mas também são osmoconformadores. Isto significa que 

o fluido celómico (CF) que preenche a cavidade corporal é muito semelhante, a nível de composição 

iónica, ao ambiente externo a que está submetido. Embora também muito idêntico, o pH do fluido 

celómico é geralmente 0.11-0.58 unidades mais baixo que o pH do exterior, devido a taxas de difusão 

de CO2 mais ou menos lentas, que podem aumentar ou reduzir a concentração de dióxido de carbono 

no CF, respetivamente. Por estas razões prevê-se que os equinodermes sejam um taxa sensível a 

ambientes ácidos. Apesar de se esperar que todas as espécies sejam afetadas de forma negativa, é 

do conhecimento científico que algumas espécies deste filo crescem e desenvolvem-se mais 

depressa quando expostas a pH ácido, enquanto outras apresentam diminuição de metabolismo ou 

redução da expressão proteica global. Considerando a diversidade incongruente de resultados 

publicados, e tendo a estrela-do-mar comum A. rubens como espécie-alvo, realizámos análises de 

expressão proteica para estudar estas observações fisiológicas de uma perspetiva molecular. 

Por forma a ter um estudo mais completo sobre o efeito da acidificação nesta espécie, 

observámos estrelas-do-mar sob diferentes tempos de regeneração (não-amputação e amputação 

após 1 dia, 4, 9 e 14) submetidas a dois pHs (controlo (CpH) – 8.1 e ácido (LpH) – 7.7), com o 

propósito de determinar com que braço preferencialmente elas iniciavam a deslocação. Os braços 

escolhidos para amputação foram os mais próximos à madreporita. As estrelas-do-mar não 

apresentaram preferência no braço ‘líder’ antes de amputadas e sob CpH, o que não é consistente 

com resultados já publicados. No entanto, como esperado, os braços amputados apresentaram uma 

diminuição do número de movimentos um dia após a regeneração ser imposta, enquanto o número 

de movimentos dos braços não-amputados permaneceu igual. Após nove dias os movimentos dos 

braços amputados foram restabelecidos para os valores iniciais (sem amputação), e por isso 

considerámos que as estrelas recuperaram o movimento normal dos braços. É vantajoso para a 



vi 
 

estrela-do-mar que este movimento seja restabelecido o mais rapidamente possível, para que possa, 

entre outros, alimentar-se e/ou fugir de possíveis predadores. 

Para estudar os fatores moleculares que possam estar envolvidos em resposta a uma futura 

diminuição do pH dos oceanos, foram recolhidos dois tipos de amostra: fluido celómico (dois pHs e 

15 dias pós-amputação), e nervo radial (RNC; dois pHs e não-amputação; dois pHs e 15 dias pós-

amputação). O CF foi centrifugado para que fossem retirados os coelomócitos, designando-se desta 

forma fluido celómico livre de células (CFF). Este fluido foi submetido a centrifugação e ultrafiltração 

para separar a fração de alta massa molecular (proteínas) da fração de baixa massa molecular. Esta 

última contém asterosaponinas, moléculas que são conhecidas por terem funções importantes a 

nível de sinalização química mas também a nível digestivo e reprodutivo, e que por isso 

considerámos essenciais neste estudo. Esta fração foi então sujeita a extração de fase sólida (SPE) 

com diferentes eluições de acetonitrilo e ácido fórmico para isolamento das asterosaponinas, e 

posteriormente analisadas por ESI-MS. Os dados foram adquiridos por um espectrofotómetro linear 

ion trap mass Thermo Finnigan LTQ, controlado pelo software Xcalibur v 2.0, também usado na 

análise dos espectros resultantes da leitura das amostras. Todas as asterosaponinas investigadas 

estavam presentes no pH controlo, mas apenas duas delas foram detetadas em estrelas-do-mar 

submetidas a pH ácido. Para além disto, as suas concentrações diminuíram em pH ácido. Tendo em 

conta que a A. rubens apresenta um baixa taxa de respiração após 27 dias exposta a pH 7.7 do que 

quando submetida a pH 8.1, podemos assumir que este decréscimo irá alterar a disponibilidade de 

ATP, e consequentemente comprometer a biossíntese de asterosaponinas. Por sua vez, a diminuição 

destas biomoléculas poderá ter efeitos negativos a nível digestivo, através da redução da absorção 

de colesterol, mas poderá também ter efeitos positivos ao nível da predação. 

As proteínas do CFF foram extraídas e precipitadas com recurso a ácido tricloroacético e beta-

mercaptoetanol, enquanto as proteínas do RNC foram extraídas e precipitadas recorrendo a azoto 

líquido e a um buffer suplementado com SDS, Tris-HCl, DTT, um cocktail anti-protease e PMSF. A 

quantificação das proteínas do CFF e RNC foi feita com recurso ao QuantiPro BCA Assay KIT 0.5-

30µg/mL protein, e a digestão, embora diferente, teve como base o uso de redutores de pontes 

persulfureto (DTT e TCEP), iodoacetamida para alquilação das cisteínas e tripsina para quebrar a 

proteína em péptidos. As amostras digeridas de ambos os tecidos foram analisadas por nano LC-

MS/MS. Foram identificadas 213 proteínas no RNC, mas apenas uma estava presente em todas as 

condições estudadas. Por esta razão, podemos concluir que o procedimento experimental deve ser 

otimizado. A análise do CFF permitiu identificar 298 proteínas, das quais 19% eram comuns às duas 

condições de pH. De acordo com estes resultados, 81% de todas as proteínas identificadas estavam 

diferencialmente expressas. Comuns a ambas as condições de pH, e como esperado, foram 

detetadas actinas, tubulinas e ubiquitinas. A quantificação realizada permitiu observar um aumento 



vii 
 

de expressão significativo apenas em 2 proteínas no pH ácido: alfa-tubulina e vitellogenina 1. A 

primeira está envolvida na formação do citoesqueleto, e por isso, será importante numa fase de 

rápida proliferação celular. A segunda proteína é responsável pelo transporte de lípidos para os 

oócitos, e o seu aumento de expressão parece aumentar o número de eventos de desova em 

estrelas-do-mar. Os baixos níveis de asterosaponinas presentes em pH ácido também parecem 

favorecer este acontecimento, aumentando desta forma, o sucesso reprodutivo.  

Com base em estudos recentes realizados em corais e em zooplâncton, previa-se um aumento 

na expressão de proteínas de stress em condições de pH ácido. No entanto, no presente estudo, as 

estrelas-do-mar submetidas a esta condição de pH, exibiram apenas uma proteína de stress. Para 

melhor compreensão dos efeitos da acidificação dos oceanos em cada uma das proteínas aqui 

identificas, será necessário realizar estudos mais detalhados para avaliar o impacto biológico da 

expressão proteica diferencial que observámos.

INTRODUCTION 

? Oc ean Ac i di fi c ati on  

Since the start of the industrial revolution (XVIII century), atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide 

(CO2) have been rising at a far greater rate (from 280 to 380ppm, and is expected to double by 2100) 

than previously experienced in Earth’s history, primarily as a result of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) 

emissions from human activities [1] (Fig. 1, 2).  Consequently, CO2 dissolved in seawater also 

increase, and will combine with water molecules to form carbonic acid (H2CO3). This acid dissociates, 

and release a hydrogen ion (H+) and a bicarbonate ion (HCO3-) until the chemical equilibrium is 

reached. Also, HCO3- releases H+ and a carbonate ion (CO32-). Most of the H+ released by the carbonic 

acid will subsequently combine with carbonate ions to form additional bicarbonate ions, thereby 

reducing the pool of carbonate ions [2]. This decrease has significant consequences for the chemistry 

of carbonate minerals that generally constitute shells, plates or skeletons of marine biota. The 

formation and dissolution of carbonate minerals can be represented as [1]:  

Mineral formation 

 

CaCO3    ?   [Ca2+]   +   [CO32-] 

 

Dissolution 

 

Once formed, calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in these structures will dissolve back into the water 

unless the surrounding seawater contains sufficiently high concentrations of carbonate ions. In 

summary, the chemical changes in seawater resulting from increased atmospheric CO2 

concentrations include increases in the concentrations of dissolved (or aqueous) carbon dioxide, 

hydrogen ions, and bicarbonate ions, and decreases in the carbonate ion concentration and pH [3] 

(Fig. 3). This group of related processes is denominated ocean acidification (OA) [4]. Some areas are

different anthropogenic sectors (sources of greenhouse 

gas emissions) [56].

regularly subjected to this process, such as 

upwelling regions, hydrothermal vents or intertidal 

zones [5] where organisms like echinoderms live in. 

Assuming that is difficult to achieve mineral 

formation under an acidic pH, calcifying 

echinoderms are predicted to be a highly sensitive 

taxa to ocean acidification [6]. Dupont et al (2010) 

[7] under the assumption of a seawater pH 

predicted to occur by the year 2100 (?pH?-0.4 

units) tested two hypotheses: (1) owing to their calcite skeleton, sea star Crossaster papposus would 

be negatively affected or (2) that owing to their lecithotrophic larvae, they may be more resistant to 

environmental changes. The larvae and juveniles raised at low pH grew and developed faster, with 

no negative effect on survival or skeletogenesis within the time frame of the experiment (38 days). 

These results allowed the authors to reject the first hypothesis. Furthermore, this species seem to be 

not only more resistant to OA, but is also performing better. Though, it is important to remember 

that negative effects may appear in the longer term or on parameters not measured in this study 

(e.g. calcification rate). Also, the brittle star Amphiura filiformi can increase the rates of metabolism 

and the ability to calcify to compensate for increased seawater acidity [8]. Although, there are also 

studies where negative effects are reported (collard 2013). 

 

? Ec hi nod er ms  

The ability to replace lost body parts or form a new functional tissue varies widely among 

animals, and this variability of regenerative potential has long perplexed biologists [9]. Since the 

earliest experimental studies on regeneration during the 1700s, it has been clear that animals, like 

amphibians, hydras, planarias, echinoderms or even humans differ substantially in their regeneration 

ability [10], in part because it can occur at multiple levels of biological organization (cell, tissue, 

internal organs, structure, or the whole body). Furthermore, it can be triggered by a variety of 

causes, occur at different stages of the life cycle, proceed via a diversity of developmental processes 

and produce structures of variable fidelity relative to the original [9]. Among others, echinoderms 

(Phylum Echinodermata) - which belong to the superphylum Deuterostomia like vertebrates - is one 

of the groups usually chosen to study regeneration. It is divided in five classes: Echinoidea (sea 

urchins), Asteroidea (sea stars), Ophiuroidea (brittle stars), Holothuroidea (sea cucumbers) and 

Crinoidea (feather stars) [11] (Fig. 4). They are exclusively marine and widely distributed in all 

oceans, from the intertidal to the abyssal regions.  

Figure 3. Chemical reaction responsible for the ocean 
acidification [57].

Echinoderms can be carnivorous, detritus foragers, or planktonic feeders, such as the sea star, 

some sea cucumbers and basket stars (ophiuroids), respectively. All classes present radial symmetry 

– although juvenile states present bilateral symmetry – usually with five or more arms, and each of 

these segments contain an exact replica of all internal organs [12]. They lack morphologically 

differentiated excretory organs and have a poor ability to osmo and ion regulate (osmoconformers) 

and that is why their coelomic fluid (CF) - the main circulatory medium - has an ionic composition 

similar to that of seawater [13]. Locomotion is accomplished using tentacle-like structures called 

tube feet, which are hydraulically controlled by a vascular system that moves water through canals of 

their small muscular tubes [14]. Along with this water vascular system, the CF ensure gas 

transportation and is involved in cell-free (humoral) immune responses due to the presence of 

proteins secreted by the coelomocytes or by the surrounding tissue like the radial nerve cord (RNC) 

[13].  This part of the nervous system is located at the oral surface of animal, where it is exposed to 

the outside environment. The RNC of each arm join together forming the circumoral nerve ring, 

which surround the mouth [15]. The fraction free of coelomocytes (acquired by centrifugation) was 

designated by us cell-free coelomic fluid (CFF) and is extremely rich in secreted molecules, like 

growth factors, hormones and neuropeptides, which are involved in cell signaling processes [14].  

 Echinoderms usually have separate sexes with no evident sexual dimorphism, and reproduction 

is typically achieved by external fertilization, with eggs and sperm freely released into seawater. The 

resulting embryos and larvae live as part of the plankton, or for others species, the eggs may be stuck 

to the undersides of rocks. Some species of sea star are able to reproduce asexually as adults either 

by fission of their central discs [16] or by autotomy (self-amputation behaviour) of one or more of 

their arms. One of most important features of Echinoderms is the presence of an endoskeleton in 

Figure 4. Examples of Echinoderms. a) Echinoidea, b) Ophiuroidea, c) 
Asteroidea, d) Holothuroidea and e) Crinoidea [58], [59]

post-metamorphic stages, which in most species occupies a significant part of their dermis. This 

endoskeleton is composed of magnesium calcite (Ca-Mg-CO3) by a process called biocalcification that 

is biologically mediated and involves ion transport pathways in echinoderms. Although 

Echinodermata are osmoconformers, their coelomic fluid’s pH is usually 0.5-1.5 units lower because 

of a high CO2 content, due to the slow elimination of this gas which is dependent on diffusion 

gradients for exchange with seawater. However, Collard et al., (2013) showed that the CF of the 

common sea star A. rubens was in equilibrium with seawater’s pH after twenty four hours exposure 

to pH 7.7, with a slight difference of less 0.21-0.40 units [17]. Nevertheless, this filo present 

significant morphological and physiological plasticity that allows them to live in different 

environments, presenting different growth rates, reproductive periodicity and environmental 

tolerances [11].  

 

o Asterias rubens 

   The common sea star (Linnaeus, 1758; figure 5, table 

1) is the most prevalent sea star on the north-east Atlantic, 

but can also be found from Arctic Norway, along Atlantic 

coasts to Senegal, and only found occasionally in the 

Mediterranean [18].  It is found on a variety of hard substrata 

and occurs from the upper tide mark down to about 400m, 

rarely down to 650m. It can also be found on mussel beds offshore. 

They are usually orange, but may vary between pale brown to violet and exceptionally can grow up 

to 52cm in diameter [19]. Spreading from a central disc with a ventral mouth and a dorsal anus it has 

5 pointed arms. The upper surface is covered in spines which are surrounded by pedicellariae, tiny 

pincers that discourage predators and keep detritus and other particulate matter from settling on 

the animal. The most apical tube feet of each arm are modified light sensory organs and the rest are 

used for locomotion and capture prey, which consists of mainly bivalves like mussels and oysters but 

also roes, carrion, gastropods, crabs, polychaete worms and other echinoderms like sea urchins, 

starfishes, brittle stars and sea cucumbers [20].  

From February to April the females release, through ventral 

pores, about 2.5 million eggs each and stimulate the males 

chemically to release their sperm, therefore fertilization is external. 

A. rubens reaches maturity with one year but can live up to 5-10 

years [20].

Mainly produced by plants, but also found in lower marine animals like sea stars and some 

bacteria, saponins are naturally occurring surface-active glycosides [21]. Their name is derived from 

their ability to form stable, soap-like foams in aqueous solutions. These molecules consists of a sugar 

moiety usually containing glucose, galactose, glucuronic acid, xylose, rhamnose or methylpentose, 

glycosidically linked to a hydrophobic aglycone (sapogenin) which may be triterpenoid in nature. 

They are of high interest due to their hemolytic, cytotoxic, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-viral and 

anti-tumor properties [21].  

Three categories of saponins have been identified in sea stars, polyhydroxysteroids glycosides, 

macrocyclic saponins and asterosaponins [22, 23], but only the latter was found in A. rubens [24]. 

Asterosaponins are ?9(11)-3?, 6?-dioxygenated steroids with a sulfate group attached at C-3 and an 

oligosaccharide chain containing five or six sugar units at C-6, and can be characterized by a wide 

degree of structural variability because individual compounds belonging to this class differ in their 

steroidal side chain and/or in their sugar moiety. Yasumoto and his group (1966) surveyed all five 

classes of echinoderms and found that only the holothurians and the asteroids elaborate these 

compounds – responsible for their toxicity –, while the echinoids, ophiuroids, and crinoids do not. 

This finding reinforced the suspected close phylogenetic relationship of sea cucumbers and sea stars 

even though holothurians have triterpenoid aglycones while asteroids have steroid aglycones [25]. 

Asterosaponins are also known for being responsible for causing an ‘escape response’ on many 

organisms when in the presence of, or contact with sea stars, thereby reducing predation success 

[26]. Specifically in asteroids, it is generally considered that saponins may have a role also in 

digestion, reproduction and chemical signaling [21].  

 

? T he pr ot eomi c  ap pr o ac h  

Recent studies suggest an uncoupling between transcript and protein levels in coccolithophores 

under ocean acidification [27] that are in agreement with older studies performed in mammalian, 

yeast and bacterial cells [28; 30]. The coupling of these levels can be as low as 40%, depending on the 

system [31], therefore knowledge of protein expression pattern is necessary to understand the direct 

link between ocean acidification stress and organism’s response. The proteome, which is the 

expressed protein complement of the genome, varies among tissues and over time, but represents 

the final and stable product of many redundant gene expression processes [32; 33]. For example, to 

address this question Dineshram et al. (2012) [34] performed 2-DE coupled with mass 

spectrophotometry to compare the global protein expression pattern of the wild Pacific oyster 

Crassostrea gigas larvae exposed to normal and high-CO2 conditions. Exposure to OA during 4 days

after fertilization resulted in marked reduction of global protein expression with a decrease or loss of 

71 proteins (18% of the expressed proteins in control) indicating a wide-spread depression of 

metabolic gene expression. Importantly, expression of proteins related to calcification and 

cytoskeleton production appears to be severally suppressed by OA.

As in many cases, our compounds of interest are found as a part of a complex mixture, and the 

role of the chromatography technique is to provide separation of the components of that mixture to 

allow their identification and/or quantitative determination. Quantification is achieved by 

comparison of the intensity (‘peak’ area) of response from samples of different experimental 

conditions.  

The separation of the components are associated with two phases: mobile and stationary. The 

former is a liquid (in which the analytes are soluble) delivered under high pressure to ensure a 

constant flow rate and thus reproducible chromatography, while the latter is packed into a column 

capable of withstanding the high pressures which are necessary. The majority of HPLC separations 

hyphenated with MS utilize reversed-phase chromatography, i.e. the mobile phase is more polar 

then the stationary phase, therefore analytes more polar elute more rapidly than the less polar ones. 

HPLC system is composed by a pump that delivers the mobile phase at a constant flow rate, an 

injector, a chromatography column and a detector.  

  

? El ec tr ospr ay  I oni z ati o n  (ESI )  

The majority of ionization techniques employed in the analysis of biomolecules are ‘soft 

ionization’s techniques which provide primarily molecular ions that occur at relatively high values of 

mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), rather than fragment ions which occur at relatively low m/z values. There 

are other ionization methods but we will only refer to the one used.  ESI technique consists of a 

liquid with the analyte of interest, which enters the ES chamber through a stainless steel hypodermic 

needle [36] and pass through a capillary, at atmospheric pressure, maintained at high voltage.  The 

liquid is dispersed and forms charged droplets which are desolvated, usually by a stream of nitrogen, 

as they pass through the atmospheric-pressure region of the source towards a counter electrode. At 

this point, the droplet deforms as the electrostatic repulsion of similar charges, in an ever-decreasing 

droplet size, becomes more powerful than the surface tension holding the droplet together. The 

droplets undergo ‘Coulombic explosion’ producing more stable droplets with a radius of 

approximately 10% of that of the parent droplet. These enters directly to a heated capillary and then 

are transferred through a series of focusing lenses into the mass spectrometer.

This system can allow quantification, but to obtain the best precision and accuracy during 

quantitative measurements an internal standard should be used. Analytical signals from both the 

analyte and the internal standard are measured and the ratio of these two signal intensities (‘peak’ 

area) are used to generate the calibration graph and to determine the amount of analyte present. 

 

? T andem -Mass sp ec tr o me tr y  (MS-M S)  

This way of generate structural information is applicable to all forms of ionization and covers a 

number of techniques in which one stage of mass spectrometry is used to isolate an ion of interest 

and a second stage is then used to probe the relationship of this ion with others from which it may 

have been generated or which it may generate on decomposition. There are a large number of 

different MS-MS experiments that can be carried out, for example, the product-ion scan, the 

precursor-ion scan, the constant-neutral-loss scan and selected decomposition monitoring.  

In this work, the product-ion scan was used to asterosaponins’ analysis, where the ion-trap 

generate product ions from a selected precursor ion, and any of these ‘product’ ions may be isolated, 

dissociated and a further product-ion spectrum obtained. In general, the first stage of mass 

spectrometry is performed to isolate an ion of interest and in the second stage, fragmentation of the 

ion is effected, usually by collision with gas molecules in a collision cell. A mass spectrum of the 

product (fragment) ions is then provided. This is termed MS-MS-MS or MS3. This process can be 

repeated, being designated by MSn. 

 

? N ano LC - MS/ M S  

The main difference from LC-MS to Nano-LC is that the latter has managed a gain in sensitivity 

that allows the analysis of peptide mixtures in sample-limited situations (e.g., proteolytically digested 

proteins isolated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis). This nano system allows the use of small 

amounts of samples due to its lower flow rate. This is possible because of the reduced column 

diameter comparing to the conventional column diameter in LC-MS.

AIM OF THE STUDY 

 

Under the paradigm that calcification will be the major biological process impacted by near 

future OA, it is often hypothesized that echinoderms will be negatively affected. Although, it is 

already known that some species have a faster regeneration recovery under low pH, and there may 

be a molecular reason behind it. Therefore, this work had three main purposes to evaluate the effect 

of ocean acidification using two environmental pH values: 1) study how regeneration affects sea stars 

arms’ use, 2) compare CFF asterosaponins’ composition in fifteen days post-amputated sea stars, and 

finally 3) study proteins expression levels in CFF and RNC using a proteomic differential approach.

METHODOLOGY 

? Ani mal  tr i al s and r eg e ner ati on i n duc ti on  

Sea stars were collected at low tide and transported to the Sven Lovén Center of Marine 

Sciences, Kristineberg (Sweden) on September 2012, and kept in flowing natural deep seawater 

under natural temperature and light regime (pH 8.06 ± 0.07 units), salinity 32%, and alkalinity of 2.18 

± 0.02mM as measured following Sarazin et al. (1999)[37]. Sea stars were visually inspected and only 

selected for the experiments if no previous signs of regeneration were present, such as different arm 

size. They were fed ad libitum with frozen mussels. For the experimental manipulation, we selected a 

seawater pH (?pH ~ -0.4 units) predicted to occur by the year 2100 [4] and it was maintained in each 

aquarium using a computerized control system (AquaMedic) that regulated pH by the addition of 

pure gaseous CO2 directly into the experimental tank. The effect of two water pH-levels, pH=8.1 

(pCO2 = 372ppm; ?ca = 3.2; ?ar = 2.0) and pH 7.7 (pCO2 = 930ppm; ?ca = 1.5; ?ar = 1.0), were 

tested on sea star arm regeneration. The former condition corresponds to control and the latter to 

ocean acidification conditions. After anesthetizing starfish with 4% (w/v) magnesium chloride in 

seawater, regeneration was induced by amputation of the arm tip at 2/3 of the way down to the 

arm, with 2 arm tips amputated per animal (arms adjacent to madreporite, figure 6). In total, ten 

experimental groups were assayed (Table 2), including two pH conditions (control pH – CpH; low pH - 

LpH), two physical conditions (amputated/ablation - A#; non-amputated/non-ablation - NA) and in 4 

post-amputation (PA) time points (1, 4, 9 and 14 days - A1, A4, A9 and A14, respectively).  

 

? B ehav i our  tr i al s  

The aim of these trials was to access recovery of lost mobility after sea star arm tips ablation. 

Each animal was assayed individually, after positioned in the center of a tank maintained in the 

above described seawater conditions. For 2 minutes it was observed with which arm(s) the animal 

preferentially leaded its displacement.  Two arm groups were assigned: 

amputated arms (AA) and non-amputated arms (NAA).

? Sampl e C ol l ec ti on  

To collect the RNC, we followed a procedure previously described by Franco et al., (2012) [38]. 

The internal fluid of the sea star was collected by puncturing the animal epidermis at the arm tip 

with a needle and collecting the fluid by gravity into an ice cold recipient. After collection and to 

prevent endogenous proteolysis, both tissues were immediately immersed in an ice cold solution of 

PBS supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (SIGMAFAST Complete Inhibitor Tablets), flash 

frozen in liquid N2 and conserved at ?80ºC until further use. Previous to freezing and to avoid 

coelomocytes lysis, low speed centrifugation (800xg, 10 minutes) was used to separate the coelomic 

fluid from the circulating cells (CFF fraction). Pools were prepared for both tissues as described in 

Table 2. 

 

? Extr ac ti on of C FF pr ote i ns and aster osap oni ns   

Nine mL of each pool of CFF were subjected to ultrafiltration (UF) using a pre-rinsed centrifugal 

filtration unit (5kDa MWCO, Vivaspin 20, VWR). Filters were washed with water to remove traces of 

glycerin and sodium azide. Samples centrifugation was performed at 20ºC and 7000xg. The high

molecular mass fraction (&gt; 5kDa) was stored at -80ºC for posterior differential proteomics. The low 

molecular mass fraction (&lt;5kDa) was used to perform solid phase extraction (SPE) for separation of 

asterosaponins. Previous to use, SPE cartridges (Strata-X 33u polymeric reversed phase, 

Phenomenex) were inserted into a SPE vacuum manifold and washed with 3 mL methanol and 3 mL 

5% (v/v) formic acid (FA). Filtrates obtained from ultrafiltration were sequentially eluted from SPE 

cartridges with 1 mL of increasing acetonitrile (ACN) concentrations (15, 25, 35, 45, 55 of 75% ACN 

(v/v) containing 5% FA (v/v)). Resultant fractions for each biological replicate were stored overnight 

at 4ºC, vacuum dried (SpeedVac concentrator, Thermo) and resuspended in 5% (v/v) FA. After use, 

SPE cartridges were regenerated with 100% (v/v) ACN.  

CFF proteins were precipitated overnight at 4ºC with 7.5 mL 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid (TCA) 

and 0.07% (v/v) ?-mercaptoethanol. Then, they were centrifuged 10 min at 4ºC and 16 000xg and 

washed three times with 70% acetone (v/v) containing 0.7% ?-mercaptoethanol (v/v) to complete 

removal of TCA. Next, samples were vacuum dried and resuspended in 50µL of 6M urea 50mM 

ammonium bicarbonate (BA).  

? RN C  pr otei ns extr ac ti o n  

The FASP protocol (adapted from [39]) was used for RNC protein extraction and tryptic 

digestion. The tissue (~100mg) was kept frozen in liquid N2 and placed in a previously chilled Teflon 

sample chamber containing four stainless steel beads (5mm diameter). The chamber was placed in a 

Mikro-Dismembrator (Sartorius) and set to 3000rpm for 60s. To avoid sample loss, the resulting 

powder (still in a deep frozen state) was resuspended in 500µL of hypotonic lysis buffer  (5% SDS, 

100mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 100mM DTT, supplemented with 1X protease inhibitor cocktail and 1mM 

PMSF). The resulting product was incubated 5 minutes at 95ºC and centrifuged to remove cellular 

debris and insoluble material (16 000xg, 10 min, 20°C). The supernatant was transferred into a 10kDa 

MWCO filter unit (Amicon Ultra 0.5mL) and 200µL of Buffer UA (8M urea in 100mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5) 

was added. A centrifugation was performed at 14 000xg, 20ºC for 15 min, the filtrate discarded and 

200µL of Buffer UA added again to the filter unit. This washing step was repeated 10 times. A last 

centrifugation was made, the filtrate discarded and the remaining sample subjected to 

quantification.

After extraction and quantification, the proteins extracts of the CFF and RNC were digested for 

nano LC-MS/MS analysis. The pH of CFF samples was adjusted to 8-8.5, added 0.7µL of 700mM DTT 

and incubated at room temperature for 1h. For alkylation of the cysteines, it was added 2.1 µL of 

700mM Iodoacetamide and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature in the dark. For 

iodoacetamide quenching, it was added 3.7 µL of 500mM N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and the samples 

were incubated 15 minutes at room temperature. To dilute the urea, 242.95 µL of 50mM BA were 

added and 2µL of trypsin to digest the proteins. The samples were incubated at 37ºC overnight. 

Finally, FA enough to have a final concentration of 0.5 % was added and the samples stored at -20ºC. 

To achieve RNC proteins digestion 100µL of Buffer UA containing 27mM TCEP were added to the 

filter unit in order to reduce the disulfide bridges. Posteriorly it was mixed at 600rpm for 1 min and 

incubated 20 min at room temperature. A centrifugation was performed at 14 000xg for 10 min, the 

filtrate discarded and 100µL of Buffer UA added to the filter unit. The samples were centrifuged 

again at 14 000xg for 15 min, the filtrate discarded and 100µL of alkylation solution (50mM 

Iodoacetamide in Buffer UA) added. Mixing 1 min at 600rpm and incubation at room temperature in 

the dark for 20 minutes was performed. An additional centrifugation (14 000xg, 10 min) was made, 

the filtrate discarded and 100µL of Buffer UA added. This step was repeated 2 additional times. 

Another centrifugation was performed, the filtrate discarded and 100µL of 50mM BA added. This 

step was repeated 2 additional times. One more centrifugation was made and 40µL of 0.05µg/µL 

tripsin and 0.8µL of 100mM CaCl2 were added to the filter unit that was then transferred to a new 

collection tube. Samples were vortexed at 600rpm for 1 min and then incubated at 37ºC for 14h. 

Posteriorly, the samples were centrifuged 15 min at 14 000xg (the filtrate was not discarded because 

it had the digested peptides) and 100µL of 50mM BA were added. This step was repeated 2 

additional times and a last centrifugation was performed. FA was added to the filtrate to have a 5% 

final concentration and the filter discarded. The peptides were vacuum dried and resuspended in 

100µL of 0.2% FA. The samples were stored at -80ºC until further analysis. 

 

? Anal y si s of aster os ap o ni ns by  ESI -t an dem M S  

Only the 55% and 75% acetonitrile elutions of the low molecular mass CFF fraction were 

analyzed due to previous non-published experiments, where not significant intensities for 

asterosaponins were detected. ESI-MS/MS data were acquired with a Thermo Finnigan LTQ linear ion 

trap mass spectrometer. Before analysis, 30µL (v/v) of methanol were added in order to facilitate the 

gas phase ion formation during the electrospray ionization process. Ten µL of 10mg/L peptide (Ae-

VFFAED-NH2) was used as standard for relative quantification. The capillary temperature was set to 

275ºC, the spray voltage was set to 5kV for negative mode. The tune parameters optimized (m/z 



14 
 

766) were set to -43V and -113.89V for capillary and tube lens voltage, respectively. The sample 

solutions were infused at a flow rate of 5µL/min directly into the mass spectrometer. Mass spectra in 

full scan acquisition mode were acquired within the mass range of m/z 200-2000. All the detected 

MS m/z values possessing minimum normalized intensity of 10% were considered relevant. Between 

MS analysis, the injection system and MS equipment were washed with ACN in order to avoid 

possible carryover. MS/MS analysis of all the selected precursors was done by CID using helium as a 

collision gas, with a normalized collision energy of 30%, an activation time of 30ms and a radio-

frequency of 0.250. ESI-tandem MS was controlled by Xcalibur v 2.0 software which was used also to 

perform data analysis.  

Based on previous trials involving A. rubens CFF asterosaponins characterization, the m/z values 

searched in the obtained MS spectra were 1143, 1157, 1227, 1243, 1257, 1273, 1373, 1389 and 

1405. Each asterosaponin was only considered present in the sample when the compound intensity 

were two-fold the background noise value. We estimated the percentage of background noise 

visually, multiplied that value by the higher absolute intensity in that spectrum and divided it by one 

hundred. We also considered that each asterosaponin was present in an experimental group when 

they were detected in at least two of the three replicates/pools. 

 

? N ano LC - MS/ M S  

The CFF and RNC samples were analyzed on a Maxis Impact q-TOF spectrometer (Bruker, 

Bremen), coupled to a nano-HPLC system (Proxeon, Denmark). One µg of each injected sample 

dissolved in 5% ACN and 0.1% FA in water, were first concentrated on a 100 µm ID, 2cm Proxeon 

nanotrapping column and then loaded onto a 75 µm ID, 25 cm Acclaim PepMap nanoseparation 

column (Thermo). The chromatography was run using a 0.1% FA - ACN gradient (2-30% in 120 min for 

total lysates digests at a flow rate 300nL/min). The column was coupled to the mass spectrometer 

inlet through a Captive Spray (Bruker) ionization source. MS acquisition was set to cycles of MS (2Hz), 

followed by 3 second cycles of MS/MS (4-16Hz, intensity depending) of a variable number of the 

most intense precursor ions, with an intensity threshold for fragmentation of 2000 counts, and using 

a dynamic exclusion time of 2 min, with an automated precursor re-selection when a 3 fold increase 

in intensity was observed. All spectra were acquired on the range 150-2200 Da. LC-MS/MS data was 

analyzed using the Data Analysis 4.2 software (Bruker).  

CFF proteins were quantified using MaxQuant 1.5.2.8 software. For RNC data, we did not had 

replicates and for that reason it was not possible to quantify. CFF and RNC proteins were identified 

using the Data Analysis 4.2 software (Bruker) to interpret LC-MS/MS and ProteinScape 3.1 using 

MASCOT search engine (version 2.2) and an echinoderm database generated by us using NCBI

protein sequences for all five classes. MS/MS spectra were searched with a precursor mass tolerance 

of 10 ppm, fragment tolerance of 0.05 Da, trypsin specificity with a maximum of 2 missed cleavages, 

cysteine carbamidomethylation set as fixed modification and methionine oxidation as variable 

modification. Significance threshold for the identifications was set to p&lt;0.05, minimum MASCOT ions 

score of 20. After, samples were subjected to Blast2GO 3.1.2 for the assignment of information about 

the biological function and cellular location, by making use of NCBI BLAST web service, swissprot 

database and a blast expectation value of 0.001.

MaxQuant were used to check if they were present in each pH condition. If this was confirmed, a t-

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

 

? B ehav i our  tr i al s  

The average number of leading movements of amputated and non-amputated sea star arms (AA 

and NAA, respectively) in two environmental conditions (control and acidic pH) and in 4 post-

amputation time-points (A1, A4, A9 and A14) is discriminated in figure 7. Statistical tests comparing 

no-ablation (NA) and each post-ablation (PA) time-point for each arm group and pH condition are 

only presented in Supplement 1. 

In the present study, A. rubens did not choose a preferential arm to lead the movement neither 

for CpH (p=0.93) or for LpH (p=0.23). As described by Ji et al. (2012) [40] and Cole (1913) [41], under 

free crawling conditions arm 5 seems to be the leading arm for A. amurensis and A. forbesi, 

respectively. Although, Ji et al. observed a more pronounced use of this arm in a fleeing situation 

that could be explained by a concentration of sense organs and nervous system in anterior side, 

supporting the theory of a bilateral behaviour in sea stars. Inconsistencies between our results and 

theirs may be due to different experimental procedures and criteria used for leading arm record. 

Regarding pH effect, Collard et al., (2013) [5] did not observed any influence in the mechanical 

properties of A. rubens tube feet. 

In our study, one day after ablation the number of movements of AA were significantly higher at 

CpH, but without differences for the remaining time-points. No differences were observed between 

pH conditions for NAA at any time-point. When comparing both arm groups, NAA were responsible 

for a significant higher number of movements at both pH conditions, except for CpH/A9 and for 

Figure 7. Weighted average number of movements of amputated and non-amputated arms (AA and NAA) 
in two pH experimental groups (CpH and LPH), and four PA time-points (A1, A4, A9 and A14). Different 
letters are used for statistically different observations in the same time-point only for intra and inter pH 
conditions, respectively between the two arm groups and within each arm group (see Supplement 2).

LpH/A14.  Since day 9, AA increased their number of movements in both pH conditions, returning to 

the values observed for the NA condition.  The NAA increased significantly the number of leading 

movements at this time-point and subsequently. The fact that we did not observed differences in 

NAA between pH conditions at any studied time-point is supported by several studies. Wood et al., 

(2011) showed that the artic brittlestar Ophiocten sericeum did not show difference in the 

percentage of functionally recovered arm regrown between the three pH treatments studied (7.3, 

7.7 and 8.3) when subjected to an ambient temperature [42]. Although, for another brittlestar, 

Aphiura filiformis, an increase of arm regeneration rate was observed at an acidic pH, together with a 

decrease in muscular mass. Furthermore, Schram et al., (2011) reported no significant differences of 

arm regeneration rates between two pH treatments (7.8 and 8.2) for the asteroidea Luidia clathrate. 

The reduced seawater pH had no effect on the biochemical composition of the body wall of 

regenerating or intact arms, and it appears that despite the combined stress of regeneration and 

exposure to CO2-driven seawater acidification, L. clathrata was able to consume sufficient nutrients 

to support functional regeneration of lost arms. It is known that lack of adequate nutrition resulted 

in preferential allocation of energy to the development of the pyloric caeca of intact arms, with 

subsequent energy secondarily allocated to arm growth [43]. In our work, sea stars were feed ad 

libitum, which mean they also did not had this constrain, and for that reason, they maintained the 

regeneration rate.

The main purpose of the experimental work using CFF’s low molecular mass fraction (&lt;5 kDa) 

was to detect and quantify the asterosaponins present in regenerating sea stars submitted to CpH 

and LpH conditions after 15 days in a regeneration situation.  

Fractions 55% and 75% were injected and analyzed by ESI-MS. An example of a mass spectrum 

for each pH condition are presented in Supplement 3, and the fragmentation patterns MS2 and MS3 

for m/z 1243 are shown in Supplement 4 also as an example. A list of mass losses of all detected 

asterosaponins is presented in Table 4. Nine asterosaponins were detected in CpH, whereas only two 

of these were detected in LpH conditions (m/z 1243 and 1257; Table 3). Identifications were made 

based only on [M-H]- m/z values and their fragmentation patterns. Retention times could have been 

also used to have a more reliable identification, since the same m/z value can have different 

retention times [44], and consequently have a different molecular composition. In another sea star 

species submitted to regeneration, M. glacialis, asterosaponins with m/z 1227, 1259, 1243, 1373 and 

1389 were present [14]. Only one more was detected when no amputation was inflicted (m/z 1405). 

This last asterosaponin was also detected in our samples from CpH/A15.

Quantification of asterosaponins detected in both pH conditions was performed using 

asterosaponin:peptide ratio (Supplement 5). It was observed that the ratios for m/z 1243 and 1257 

decreased from mean values of 14 and 21 in CpH to values of 3 and 2 in LpH group, respectively (a 

decrease of around 4 and 9 times, respectively). Although there is a high variation coefficient value, a 

decrease was observed for all LpH replicates and for both asterosaponins.  

All together these data show that a decline of 0.4 pH units cause a decrease on the number of 

detected asterosaponins. The two asterosaponins detected in both pHs, m/z 1243 and 1257, were 

also among the most abundant in a Demeyer et al. (2014) [44] report. They showed their presence in 

all A. rubens body components studied (aboral body wall, oral body wall, stomach, pyloric caeca and 

gonads). This is also true for m/z 1227 and 1273. Both studies revealed that asterosaponins 

concentrations differ greatly among individuals, which corresponds to a huge biological variability in 

this species. There is also known that sea star’ asterosaponins present seasonal fluctuation, having a 

higher concentration during June and July [25]. Furthermore, Demeyer et al. (2014) [44] confirmed 



19 
 

significant diversity of asterosaponins among organs, being detected a larger number in oral and 

aboral body walls and a higher concentration in the latter and in the gonads. In the literature it is also 

suggested that in sea star, asterosaponins may play a role as a spawning inhibitor [46], an important 

feature for the control of reproduction.  

Considering that A. rubens present a lower respiration rate after 27 days at pH 7.7 than at pH 

8.1 [5], we can hypothesize that at time-point A15 the cellular respiration was diminished, leading to 

a lower ATP availability, which could compromise asterosaponins biosynthesis. These events may 

explain our results, in which a decrease of the number of asterosaponins detected was observed, but 

also a reduction in the concentration of the ones present in acidic pH environment. This may have 

negative impact on their digestive function, by reducing the ability to absorb cholesterol. Although, 

there are positive effects in their chemical signaling functions, enhancing predation ability when an 

‘escape response’ event is involved.

Several works  regarding A. rubens subjected to arm regeneration has been published (e.g.: ref 

[17]) but not at the proteomic level. One limitation when performing this type of approach is the 

absence of an annotated genome for Asteroidea. For this reason the current study is, in its majority, 

a homology-driven proteomic characterization, usually with S. purpuratus, the closest phylogenetic 

relative with a sequenced genome. In this study, 66% of all identified proteins are homologs to the 

proteins of this sea urchin. As previously mentioned, we performed relative quantification of CFF 

proteins using mass spectrometry data and MaxQuant software. Only two of the 31 proteins 

identified were differentially expressed between pH conditions (p&lt;0.05), showing a significant 

intensity increase at low pH (Table 4). This event can correspond to a positive response from the 

organism, since these proteins, Vitellogenin 1 and alpha-tubulin1, are respectively responsible for 

deposition of yolk substances in the oocytes [47], and for cytoskeleton structure [48]. Actin was 

expressed in both pH conditions.  

Since we reported a decrease in asterosaponins at an acidic pH, and knowing that these 

molecules are spawning inhibitors [46], the increase in vitellogenin expression is required to couple 

with an intensive oocytes production. Additionally, Dupont et al., (2010) showed for C. papposus, 

larvae and juveniles raised at low pH grow and develop faster. The combined effects of an increase in 

vitellogenin expression and a decrease in asterosaponins biosynthesis appears to contribute to an 

enhanced reproductive ability at an acidic pH.  

As mentioned before [49], A. rubens present an increased cellular proliferation at a control pH 

environment between 7 and 21 days post-amputation. Consequently, this will involve cytoskeleton

biogenesis. Eventually, at an acidic pH for A15, cellular proliferation increases and a higher alpha-

tubulin expression will be need for the cytoskeleton formation. 

 

 

Table 4. Statistical analysis of proteins’ quantification results: t-Student tests were performed in LFQ intensity values 
of proteins present in CpH and LpH environments. Significant differences were considered for p&lt;0,05. 

 

 

After Blast2GO analysis, we compared GO terms annotations from all CFF proteins identified at 

both CpH and LpH samples, and no differences were observed among the several classes (Figures 7 

and 8). Data show that the most represented biological processes (BP) are biological regulation, 

response to stimulus, cellular component organization or biogenesis, and cellular, developmental, 

metabolic, multicellular organismal and single-organism processes. The two major molecular 

functions (MF) represented are binding and catalytic activity. All these GO terms are represented by 

more than 6% and 10% of all identified proteins, for BP and MF, respectively. For more details on GO 

terms see Supplement 6.Although no differences were observed in the GO terms, differences are 

obvious when comparing the list of proteins (Figure 9). From 186 proteins identified in LpH group 

and 168 in CpH group, 56 are common (a detailed table for all proteins identified, “CFF protein 

identification”, is supplied in CD-ROM).  It is worth to mention that the list of proteins used to create 

the GO terms’ graphs is not the same used to construct the Venn diagram. Shortly, B2G homology 

search was done against a general database without taxonomy restrictions, so we only used it for GO 

annotation. Although more than one hundred proteins are different between pH conditions (figure 

9), this is not reflected in GO terms distribution (figures 7 and 8). The total number of CFF proteins 

identified in our study (298), is in agreement with Dheilly et al., (2013) [48] that identified 307 

proteins in S. purpuratus, although trough different methods.In this work, as in ours, many proteins 

had multiple homologs, which included actin, tubulin and heat 

shock proteins. From 298 proteins identified, 227 were “Predicted”, 

54 “uncharacterized”, 6 “putative” and 4 “hypothetical”.

As expected, it were detected Heat Shock Proteins (HSP), or stress proteins. Although, we were 

predicting an HSP expression increase under a low pH condition, based on recent reports concerning 

corals and zooplankton [50, 51]. But surprisingly, they were found only at CpH (HSP90-alpha-isoform, 

HSP70 protein 1-like, heat shock cognate 71kDa protein or Hsc71), with exception of one that was 

present at the LpH condition (heat shock 70 kDa protein IV-like). General functions of stress proteins 

include protein folding, peptide chaperone, cytoprotection, intracellular signaling, cell-cycle control 

and buffering of harmful mutations [52]. Besides HSPs, nine ubiquitin homologs were found in both 

pH conditions, as expected. Attachment of a short chain of ubiquitins, for example, to a lysine, tags 

the protein for intracellular proteolytic destruction by a proteasome [53]. This is reported for M. 

glacialis for a regeneration condition [54].  

Next, we will discuss the proteins identified in only one of the pH conditions studied, and in their 

majority also identified in Dheilly et al. (2013) [48] work, as seen in supplements provided in the CD-

ROM.  

o CFF proteins detected in control pH  

In this condition it were identified myosin V, interaptin, nesprin-1, dynein heavy chain 3 and 5, 

and avdillin as being involved in the dynamic properties of actin filaments and cytoskeletal 

modifications. Involved in immune response we found complement C2-like, that is a part of the 

complement system, which evolved as a supplement of the innate immune system. This protein is, 

among others, responsible for the formation of an enzymatic activity called a C3 convertase, that 

eventually will help opsonize pathogens, and induce a series of inflammatory responses that help to 

fight infection [53]. A transport protein SFT2, responsible for vesicle-mediated transport was found, 

as for a Na+/K+ ATPase alpha-1 subunit, which is located in the membrane to act like a 

sodium/potassium-exchanging ATPase activity. We also found sodium channel and clathrin linker 1, 

sodium/potassium/calcium exchanger 2 isoform X1 and sodium/glucose cotransporter 4. A very 

important protein involved in cell cycle control, cyclin-dependent kinase 1 was also identified.  

o CFF proteins detected in low pH  

In pH 7.7 we found Ras-related protein Rab-33 isoform X1 and Ras-related protein Rab-10 

isoform X1, which are small GTPases responsible for regulating intracellular membrane trafficking 

and formation of transport vesicles to their fusion with membranes. Acting in cell signaling it were 

identified hexokinase and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6. In humans, apoptosis-

inducing factor 2, a flavoprotein oxidoreductase, binds single stranded DNA and is thought to 

contribute to apoptosis in the presence of bacterial and viral DNA. The expression of the gene that 

encode this protein is also found to be induced by tumor suppressor protein p53 in colon cancer

cells. Involved in stress response, it was identified catalase, which help protect against the 

destructive effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Only identified in this pH was lysozyme, an 

enzyme abundant in most vertebrates body fluids, lyses both Gram-positive and negative bacteria, 

and interact directly or indirectly to modulate the complement activation cascade [48]. Histone H3 

and histone H2A are involved in cell cycle. The former plays a key role in guaranteeing tension-

sensing function in mitosis, while the latter may be required for proper centromere function during 

chromosome segregation in S. cerevisiae. Talin-1 isoform X2 are known to link integrins to the actin 

cytoskeleton, inhibits cadherin transcription and is involved in phagocytosis in mammals. But in 

echinoderms its function is not clear. Also acting in an actin-based cytoskeleton we identified 

cingulin-like protein 1. Tenascin-R-like is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein of the central nervous 

system. Hamartin is possibly a tumor suppressor. Chymotrypsin B is a pancreatic serine proteinase 

known to cleave substrates selectively at peptide bonds formed by some hydrophobic residues, like 

tryptophan, phenylalanine and tyrosine. Beta-arrestin-1 is essentially signal transductor inhibitor.  

To better understand the effect of a low pH environment in each protein identified here, more 

studies have to be perform detailing the biological impact of the differential expressions observed.

For protein extraction/digestion of the radial nerve cord a new approach was used. The nano LC-

MS/MS allowed identification of 213 proteins, although only one was common to all conditions 

studied (Figure 10). This result lead us to conclude that an optimization of the experimental 

procedure used should be performed.

CONCLUSIONS 

The aim of this work was to study the effect of the future predicted ocean acidification 

conditions under arm regeneration in the common sea star, Asterias rubens. First, it was observed 

their preference in choosing a leading arm when subjected to several regeneration time-points under 

a control and an acidic pH. It was concluded that they do not have a preferred leading arm before 

ablation in both pHs. Although, one day after amputation, and as expected, the number of 

movements of the amputated arms drastically decrease, being significantly higher the control pH 

condition. Since day 9, amputated arms restored their initial number of movements, and non-

amputated arms increased it. We can conclude that at this time-point, normal movement was 

recovered.  

We also searched for the presence of asterosaponins, molecules that have digestive, 

reproductive and chemical signaling functions. We observed that two of the nine molecules detected 

in the control pH, were also detected in low pH samples (m/z 1243 and 1257). Furthermore, their 

concentration decreased, suggesting that acidic pH may alter their biosynthesis. Nevertheless, 

further studies are needed to understand the effect of these lower levels of asterosaponins in A. 

rubens’ biological processes. 

Finally we performed a differential proteomic approach on the radial nerve cord and cell-free 

coelomic fluid tissues. The former analysis suggests an optimization of the experimental procedure 

used. Although, CFF analysis allowed identification of 298 proteins, of which 19% were common to 

both conditions. According to these results, 81% of all proteins identified were differentially 

expressed among pH 7.7 and 8.1, and future studies should emphasis this aspect in order to better 

understand their functions.  

Merging all the results, we propose a correlation between an acidic environment and 

asterosaponins’ biological effects. The decline in diversity and amount of these biomolecules can be 

caused by already known decreases in respiratory rate and cholesterol absorption. Although, 

asterosaponins might have positive effects in predation and reproduction. The detected increase in 

vitellogenin expression seems to be associated with the amplified spawning event induced by the 

low levels of asterosaponins at acidic pH, thereby also enhancing reproduction.
