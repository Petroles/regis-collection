Abstract

In a field trial involving 68 rubber tree (Hevea spp.) clones calculation of genotypic correlation coefficients revealed
significant age-age correlation from age 1 to 6 (immature period) for girth A and for age 7 to 12 (mature period) for
girth B and for age 7 to 12 (production of latex) for yield. Rank correlation coefficients between all immature ages of
girth (girth A), all ages of mature girth (girth B) and all annual rubber production (yield) were significant for the three
traits, with the coefficients decreasing with increasing age. Selection of the sets of best 30, 15, 10 and 5 clones from
the available 68 clones at a given age was generally accompanied by a descending order of percentage success. It
was suggested: (a) to have the best 30 clones of age 6, select the set of best 36 clones at age 2, (b) to have the best
15 clones of age 6, select the set of best 20 clones at age 3, (c) to have the best 5 clones of age 6, select the set of
best 8 clones at age 4, and (d) to have the best 3 clones of age 6, select the set of best 3 clones at age 5. More than
80% of the targeted clones on girth A or girth B basis and more than 76.7% clones on yield basis were found to get
selected at steps (a) through (d). For achieving early multiplication of the most productive clone for deployment,
multiplication should be started with the best 36 (i.e. 60%) clones selected at age 2.

Key words: Hevea brasiliensis, early clonal multiplication, genetic correlation, rank correlation, evaluation of clones.

Introduction

The major source of natural rubber is the rubber tree,
Hevea brasiliensis (Willd. Adr. ex Juss.) Muell.-Arg. (fam-
ily Euphorbiaceae), which is perennial and has na economi-
cally useful lifespan of ‘30-35 years. Adult trees shed their
leaves almost completely for 3-4 weeks each year in a pro-
cess known as wintering, subsequent to which they undergo
“flushing” and produce new flowers, leaves and shoots.
Flowering in Hevea normally occurs once a year after leaf
fall and is directly affected by climatic factors, Hevea spe-
cies having traditionally been cultivated in humid equato-
rial regions subject to monsoons (Rao and Vijayakumar,
1992) and characterized by adequate rainfall distribution
and small yearly fluctulations in temperature and humidity
(Rao et al., 1993). In some countries to achieve self-

sufficiency, attempts have been made to extend Hevea cul-
tivation to marginal areas with varied climatic constraints,
some areas being as far north as 29° in India and China and
south to 23° in the Brazilian state of São Paulo
(Pushparajah, 1983; Ortolani et al., 1998).

Rubber trees are grown for their latex from which is
collected by tapping, coagulated and processed to form rub-
ber, hence it is the dry rubber yield that determines the level
of output. Girth is considered to be a measure of vigor and
is also an economically important character because it de-
termines the age at which a Hevea clone can be commer-
cially exploited by tapping and is, therefore, important in
shortening the uneconomic immature period of the clone.
However, there are several high yielding clones whose
girthing is depressed by tapping (Abraham, 1992) because
this procedure is controlled wounding and as such stresses
the tree and retards growth, especially if carried out when
the trees are budding.

Research Article



In tree breeding, early selection has been shown to
have three main advantages: increased overall selection in-
tensity or a reduce in the amount of field-testing a shortened
generation interval; and the fact that genetic information
from early testing can be used to enhance selection effi-
ciency maturity (Wu, 1998). Wu (1998) has developed a
theoretical basis to study the effects of increased overall se-
lection intesity and reduced field-testing but the most fre-
quently cited advantage of early selection in tree breeding
is shortened generation interval because this causes a re-
duction in the length of the breeding cycle (Nanson, 1970;
Lambeth, 1980; McKeand, 1988; Adams et al., 1989; Ad-
ams and Atiken, 1992; Matheson et al., 1994). Shortening
the breeding cycle of a tree through early selection can pro-
duce more genetic gains per unit time (year) if there is
strong genetic correlation between early and mature traits.

Rubber is a forest tree crop and takes more than 25
years to complete a breeding cycle because of which ge-
netic improvement of Hevea is normally a slow process,
even for a single selection and breeding cycle. In Hevea
breding there is usually a lapse of 3 years from pollination
to field planting and since rubber trees generally require
several years (often 6 or more) to reach tapping girth there
is a wait of 7-9 years until tapping is started and then a
10-15 years period of tapping and clone evaluation.

Determining trends in age-age correlation is rela-
tively simple for growth and yield traits, requiring only pa-
tience and repeated assessment. While there have been
many reported age-age correlations for growth in conifers
(e.g. Lambeth, 1980; McKeand, 1988; Riemenschneider,
1988; King and Burdon, 1991; Matheson et al., 1994) there
are few for Hevea species (Gonçalves et al, 1988.)

The objective of the research described in the present
paper was to use age-age correlations and selection effi-
ciency estimates to study the potential of early selection of
Hevea for forward breeding using data from a series of as-
sessments of a Hevea spp. clone trial carried out in the
northwest of the Brazilian state of São Paulo.

Material and Methods

In this study we used 55 Brazilian, 10 Malaysian and
three Indonesia genotypes (clones) from a small-scale
clone trial belonging to the Campinas Agronomic Institute
(Instituto Agronômico de Campinas - IAC), Campinas, São
Paulo state, Brazil) breeding program. The Brazilian clones
were developed by the IAC breeding program while the
Malaysian genotypes consisted of seven Rubber Research
Institute of Malaysia (RRIM) clones and three clones be-
longing to the Prang Besar (PB) private rubber plantation.
The Indonesian genotypes (clones) came from Proefstation
voor Rubber (PR) in Sumatra. All the clones were budded
onto established rootstock (Tjir 1 x Tjir 16) at the nursery.
One-year-old rootstock seedlings raised in nurseries were
used to budgraft clonal materials in December 1990, suc-
cessful budgrafts being transplanted into polyethylene bags

and the plantlets established in the field after the first flush
of leaves developed.

The clones were grown at the Votuporanga Experi-
mental Station (20°25’ S, 49°59’ W, elevation 450 m) in the
nortwest of the Brazilian state of São Paulo. Mean monthly
temperatures varied from 20 to 25°C and the average an-
nual rainfall ranged from 1.087 mm to 1.537 mm and the
winter drought varied from four to six dry months with an
average water deficiency of 180 mm. The trial was laid out
in a randomized complete block design with three repli-
cates using six trees replications per plot and 7 x 3 m spac-
ing. Missing plants were replaced with spares during the
first two years after planting to maintain plantation density
but were not scored. One row of the commercial clone
RRIM 600, acquired from a commercial nursery, was
planted around the plot. Annual fertilization consisted of
400 g of 10-10-10 NPK formula per plant (Bataglia and
Gonçalves, 2002).

Twelve months after planting the diameter of the
stems of the plantlets were measured 0.5 cm above ground
level using a slide caliper and this measurement converted
to girth assuming that the stem was cylindrical. Immature
girth (girth A) was measured at 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 years and
mature grith (girth B) at 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 years. At the end
of the sixth year all the trees with a girth of 45 cm or more
were tapped for annual latex production 1.2 m above the
highest point of the bud union using a half-spiral four-day
tapping system (seven tappings per month) for 11 months
per year. Yield was recorded on the days when normal tap-
ping, which starts around 7:30 AM, was possible, the latex
being collect in individual plastic cups for each tree and co-
agulated by adding 2% (v/v) acetic acid solution, with stir-
ring, to the cup once the latex flow had stopped. The
coagulated rubber in each cup was made into a “biscuit”
which was dried for about 30 days by hanging it on a wire
tied to the tree from which it had been extracted. After dry,
each rubber biscuit was weighed and the dry rubber content
for each tree recorded. Attempts were made to record 12
girths measurements and six annual yields.

A combined three-factor cross classification analysis
of variance (ANOVAR) was performed on the data using
the statistical model:

Yijk = ? + gi + aj + bk + (ga)ij + (gb)ik + (ab)jk + (gab)ijk,

where, Yijk = observed value of the ith genotype in the year
in the kth replication; ? = general mean; gi = fixed effect of
the ith genotype (i = 1, 2,g, g = 68); aj = effects of the jth
year (j = 1, 2,s, s = 6); bk = effect of the kth randomized
block (k = 1, 2,b, b = 3); (ga)ij = interaction between ith ge-
notype with the jth year; (gb) ik = interaction between ith ge-
notype with the kth replication; (gab)ijk = interaction
between genotype, year and replication. It the assumed that
the interactions (ab)ij and (gb)ik were not significant, these
being included in the residual together with (gab)ijk.

Data from more than three traits were used for com-
putation of genotypic age-age correlation using the Selegen
software (Resende and Oliveira, 1997). Values of
genotypic correlation were computed among all traits and
age combinations. Genotypic correlations were worked out
according to Kempthorne (1966) as follows:

r
COVg

g xy

xy

gx gy

( )

( )
?

?? ?

,

where COVg(xy) = the genotypic covariance for traits x and
y; ?

gx

2 = genotypic variance for trait x; ?
gy

2 = genotypic vari-
ance for trait y.

For each trait, Spearman’s rank correlation coeffi-
cient (rs) was computed between age 6 and younger ages.
Rank 1 was assigned to the lowest value and rank 68 to the
highest value within each age for a given trait. The signifi-
cance of these correlations was tested using the Table XXV
of Fisher (1941), for genotypic correlations for 5 and 1%
probability. The genotypic correlations were tested at the
degrees of freedom of the error. Percent success in correctly
selecting the best 5, 10, 15 or 30 clones at age 2 and above
was calculated using the ranks of clones method. Scatter
plots between ranks at age 6 and at younger ages were plot-
ted for each trait. Scatter plots of ranks for girth between
age 2 and 3, age 3 and 4, and age 4 and 5 were also pro-
duced, showing the identification numbers of respective
clones against the plotted points.

Results

All effects including the genotype versus years inter-
action were highly significant (p &amp;lt;0.01) statistically in the
overall analysis of variance for girth A, girth B and yield
(Table 1).

Significant positive genotypic correlation coeffi-
cients (rg) were observed for all the combinations of traits
and ages (Table 2). The rg values were higher for traits of
the same age group and as the difference increased rg usu-
ally decreased. The rg values within a trait varied from
0.3916 to 0.9916 for girth A, 0.5116 to 0.9517 for girth B

and 0.3916 to 0.9612 for yield. The rg values between girth
A and girth B were high, althoygh both girth values showed
low rg values in relation to yield.

Similarly, significant of rank correlation coefficient
(rs) values were observed between age 6 and younger ages
for girth A, girth B and yield (Table 3). The values of rs with
reference to age 6 ranged from 0.5498 (for age 1) to 0.9420
(for age 5) for girth A, from 0.5114 (for age 1) to 0.9471
(for age 5) for girth B, and from 0.3451 (for age 1) to 0.8311
(for age 5) for yield. Since rs was significant for all age
combinations, it shows that there were no drastic changes in
the ranks of the different clones between age 1 and 6.

Table 4 shows that selecting the best 30 clones at age 2
would lead to the best 69.93% of clones on a girth A basis (or
76.59% on a girth B or yield basis) being correctly selected at
age 6 and the proportion increased to between 83.25% and
89.91% if selection was made at age 3 and 89.91% to
96.57% at age 4. The success in correctly selecting the set of
the best 15 clones at age 6 by selection at age 3 was 66.70%
on a girth A basis and 80.04% on a girth B or yield basis, the
success being much lower when the trees were selected at
less than 3 years of age. The success in correct selection of
the set of the best 5 clones at age 4 was 80% on a girth A or
girth B basis and only 60% on a yield basis.

Figure 1 shows the scatter plot of ranks of clone
means for girth A by plotting the ranks at age 6 along
X-axis and ranks at younger ages along the Y-axis. With an
increase in age along the Y-axis, the plotted points tend to
converge along the imaginary diagonal drawn from the ori-
gin. If the ranks on the X and Y-axes belong to the same
age, the plotted points would be axiomatically be on the di-
agonal. As the difference in age in the two axes increased,
the values of X and Y fall more and more out of step, result-
ing in increased scattering of the points and lower rs values.

Of the best 34 girth A clones (ranking from 35 to 68) at
age 6, 24 were also among the best 34 clones at age 2 while
27 clones were among the best 36 clones at this age. By se-
lecting the best 34 girth A clones at age two we could select
76.7% of the best 34 clones at age 6 and this success rate
could be increased to 90% if 38 age 2 clones were used. Sim-
ilarly, by selecting the best 15 girth A clones at age 3 we

could select 80% of the set of the best 15 clones at age 6 and
this success rate could be increased to 93.3% if 20 age 2
cloens were used. Selecting the best 5 girth A clones at age 4
meant that 60% of the set of the best 5 clones could be se-
lected at age 6 and this could be increased to 100% if 8 clones
were selected at age 4 (Figure 1). The scatter plots of girth B
and yield (not shown) also showed a similar trend. Selection
of the set of the 3 most productive clones at age 6 could be
made with accuracy at age 5, although the ranks of the three
clones changed among themselves during the sixth year.

Of the best 20 clones at age 3, the number of clones
that simultaneously existed in the set of the best 36 clones at
age 2 was 20 on a girth A basis [Figure 2(i)] and 19 each on
a girth B or yield basis. The best 8 clones at age 4 invariably
appeared in the set of the best 20 clones at age 3 for girth A
(Figure 2 (ii)), girth B or yield. Each of the best 5 clones at
ages 5 and 6 were among the best 8 clones at age 4 for girth
A (Figure 2 (iii)), or girth B, while only 4 clones out of 5
top-ranking clones at age 6 could do so in respect of yield.

Discussion

The presence of significant clone versus site interac-
tion indicates that genotypes perform differently between
years for girth A, girth B and yield.

Existence of a strong, positive genotypic correlation
(Table 2) as well as rank correlation (Table 3) between girth
A, girth B and yield suggests that selection of clones for su-
periority in respect of one of these traits would inevitably
lead to selection of superior clones in respect to the other
two traits as well. However, any decision on the selection of
clones should preferably be taken on the basis of the girth A
trait because vigor, represented by girth volume, is more
closely related with girth A than with girth B or yield only.
We also suggest that for early evaluations girth A should be
used in preference to secondary characters such as height,
number of laticiferous vessel rings, etc.

It was not possible to predict with any fair degree of
success as to which clone would occupy a particular rank at

panel opening age (Figure 1). At younger ages, a realistic
attempt can be made to determine only the set of the best n
clones (n &gt; 1) at panel opening age, without allocating the n
ranks of panel opening age to individual clones. Therefore,
exchange of ranks between clones within the selected set of
clones was not viewed as a waste of selection effort during
this study.

Gottardi et al., (1995) reported that the ranking in
girth A among 11 Hevea clones did not vary much after 3
years up to 7 years of age. The mean data for each clone
showed good genotypic correlation for girth between age 7
and young ages. The coefficient increased with increasing
age suggesting that early selection was possible. Gonçalves
et al., (1998) suggested that selection of fastest growing

Hevea clones could be done on a girth basis after 24
months.

Our study shows that in São Paulo it may be unwise to
select Hevea clones at age 1, although the 2 to 4-year
growth data can be used differentially in the selection pro-
cess. Selection of the sets of the best 30, 15, 10 and 5 clones
from the available 68 clones at a given age was generally
accompanied by a descending order of percentage success
(Table 4). Thus, for a given level of percentage success in
selection, the set of clones to be selected at a relatively
young age needs to be large, while selection of a small set
needs a higher selection age. Therefore, it is suggested that:
a) to have the best 30 (i.e. 44% of the available germplasm)
clones at age 6 select the set of the best 36 (53%) clones at
age 2; b) to have the best 15 (22%) clones at age 6 select the
set of the best 20 (29.41%) clones at age 3; c) to have the
best 5 (7.35%) clones at age 6 select the set of the best 8
(11.76%) clones at age 4; and d) to have the best 3 (4.4%)
clones at age 6 just select the set of the best 3 (4.41%)
clones at age 5. More than 80% of the clones targeted on a
girth A or yield basis, and more than 76,7% clones targeted
on a girth B basis, were found to be correctly identified dur-
ing steps (a) to (d). Nevertheles, the 5 highest-ranking age 6
clones (viz. clones with identification numbers 68, 67, 66,
65 and 64) on a girth A (Figure 1 and 2) or girth B basis
were found to be invariably present in the sets of clones se-
lected at (a), (b) and (c).

One is often faced with the task of making early selec-
tion of clones on the basis of a field test to give interim rec-
ommendation about the choice of clone for further
multi-location testing (large-scale trials). The age of early
selection needs to be sufficently long to effect a reasonable
level of selection accuracy. After making early selection,
vegetative multiplication of the selected clones is started
and it is continued for many years in order to build the
budwood stock nursery which is large enough to supply
buds to all rubber producers on a sustained basis. To
shorten the time involved in this two-stage process of (i) se-
lecting the most promissing clones, followed by (ii) multi-
plying their germplasm, an alternative approach involving
concurrent short-listing and multiplication of clones is sug-
gested. According to this approach, early selection of the
best 60% of clones should be done at age 2 of the field trial

and their vegetative multiplication should be immediately
started in the nursery. Short-listing of the best 33% (of the
original number of clones under test) clones should be done
from within the above set of clones select at age 3 on the ba-
sis of (a) age 3 growth data in field trial and (b) grafting and
survival performance of buds during the previous year in
nursery. Propagation of the rejected clones should be
stopped by uprooting and eliminating the rejected clones
(roguing). This process of the simultaneous roguing of
clones on the basis of current evaluation and the vegetative
propagation of select clones can be continued in the subse-
quent years until the desired selection intensity and number
of clones (ramets) are archieved, the best 5% of clones be-
ing shot-listed at age 5.

Early selection might result in some bias against
clones which grow relatively slow in the initial stage but
catch up with others at the later stages. However, Figure 1
and Table 2 suggest that such clones would be very few,
and , in fact, such clones would lag behind others if planted
in intimate mixture with other clones at high densities.
Since the objective of a Hevea improvement program is to
maximize gains per unit time it is undesirable to delay mak-
ing interim recommendation about choice of clones and
starting their vegetative multiplication on the basis of early
evaluation just because sporadic clones would be
disfavored. Final recommendation on the choice of clones
for later deployment in plantations and for serving as par-
ents for the next generation of Hevea improvement can be
done at year 4 because in São Paulo Hevea normally does
not flower before this age.

Conclusions

Early selection of Hevea clones for tapping panel
opening at age of 6 years can be done effectively at age 4.
Selection at age 2 is relatively less accurate but it results in
early propagation of selected clones for further testing or
deployment. To combine the advantages of these two early
selection ages we suggest a differential selection strategy,
i.e. the best 60% of clones of the original set should be se-
lected at age 2,33% at age 3, 13% at age 4 and 5% at age 5.
The sets of clones to be selected at age 3 and later should be
contained in the sets selected in the perceding years. Multi-
plication of the selected clones should be started at the end
of the second year of the field trial and continued in succes-
sive years. Selection at age 2 should be done on the basis of
growth, preferably vigor (girth A) in the field trial.
