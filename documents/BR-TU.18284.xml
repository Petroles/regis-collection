RESUMO 

 

 

SOUZA, Thiago Lívio Pessoa Oliveira de, D.Sc., Universidade Federal de 
Viçosa, agosto de 2009. Obtenção de SNPs, reação do feijoeiro comum 
à ferrugem da soja e piramidação de genes de resistência a Uromyces 
appendiculatus. Orientador: Everaldo Gonçalves de Barros. Co-
Orientadores: Maurilio Alves Moreira, José Eustáquio de Sousa Carneiro e 
Cosme Damião Cruz. 

 

 

Este trabalho apresenta resultados de pesquisas desenvolvidas no âmbito do 

Programa de Melhoramento do Feijoeiro conduzido na Universidade Federal 

de Viçosa (UFV), sendo este composto por seções ou subprojetos distintos.  

Desta forma, optou-se por redigi-lo na forma de artigos científicos, sendo um 

de revisão e quatro de resultados originais, os quais já foram ou serão 

submetidos para publicação em periódicos internacionais. Por esse motivo, 

decidiu-se por escrevê-los no idioma inglês, em congruência com as Normas 

de Redação de Teses e Dissertações da UFV. Os resumos de tais artigos 

contendo suas justificativas, seus objetivos e principais resultados são 

apresentados a seguir: 1) Identificação de SNPs (Single Nucleotide 

Polymorphisms) no feijoeiro – SNPs, diferenças de um único nucleotídeo ou 

pequenas inserções/deleções (indels) entre fragmentos homólogos de DNA,  

foram identificados no feijoeiro (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) por meio do re-

sequenciamento de STSs (Sequence-Tagged Sites) gerados por primers 

desenhados para amplificar sequências shotgun e BAC-end de soja e regiões 

gênicas e microssatélites de feijão. Os fragmentos de DNA contendo SNPs 

foram identificados em produtos de PCR (bandas únicas de DNA) obtidos a 

partir de seis linhagens de feijão, três de origem Andina (‘Jalo EEP558’, 

‘G19833’ e ‘AND 277’) e três de origem Mesoamericana (‘BAT93’, ‘DOR 

364’ e ‘Rudá’). O tamanho final do alinhamento das sequências de DNA 

obtidas foi de 134.653 pb, onde foram identificados 677 SNPs, incluindo 555 

mudanças de base (295 transições e 260 transversões) e 122 indels.  Verificou-



 

 xi

se uma frequência de 5,16 SNPs/kb. A diversidade nucleotídica média 

expressa pelo coeficiente teta de Halushka foi de 0,00226. Este trabalho 

representa um esforço pioneiro para a identificação de SNPs no feijoeiro.  2) 

Resistência à ferrugem asiática da soja no feijoeiro – A incidência da ferrugem 

asiática da soja (FAS), incitada pelo fungo Phakopsora pachyrhizi, tem sido 

constatada em cultivares de feijão. Neste trabalho, 44 acessos de feijoeiro 

foram testados para resistência ao P. pachyrhizi. Entre estes estavam incluídas 

fontes de resistência a diferentes doenças do feijoeiro, cultivares comerciais 

dos grupos carioca, preto e vermelho, e linhagens avançadas desenvolvidas 

pelo programa de melhoramento do BIOAGRO/UFV. Foram identificadas 14 

fontes de resistência. ‘PI181996’, ‘Pérola’ e ‘Redlands Pioneer’ apresentaram 

os menores graus médios de reação ao patógeno. A herança da resistência à 

FAS no acesso ‘PI181996’ foi estudada e os resultados indicam que esta 

característica é monogênica e dominante.  3) Melhoramento do feijoeiro para 

resistência à ferrugem no BIOAGRO/UFV, Brasil – O feijoeiro é uma cultura 

de reconhecida importância social, nutricional e econômica.  No entanto, 

quando comparada a outras espécies leguminosas de interesse agronômico, sua 

produtividade média ainda é considerada baixa. Um dos fatores que explicam 

esta situação é o grande número de doenças que acometem o feijoeiro e 

causam danos severos. Entre elas destaca-se a ferrugem, incitada pelo fungo 

Uromyces appendiculatus, o qual apresenta alta variabilidade. O controle da 

ferrugem por meio do uso de cultivares resistentes é uma estratégia viável, 

econômica e de fácil adoção, a ser usada de forma integrada às outras práticas. 

Neste trabalho são apresentadas importantes informações sobre a doença, além 

de relevantes iniciativas de melhoramento visando o desenvolvimento de 

cultivares resistentes à ferrugem no BIOAGRO/UFV.  4) Caracterização do 

gene de resistência à ferrugem presente na cultivar de feijoeiro ‘Ouro Negro’, 

a principal fonte de resistência usada no Brasil – A identificação e 

caracterização de novas fontes de resistência (R) constituem etapas 

fundamentais para os programas de melhoramento que visam ao 

desenvolvimento de cultivares com resistência efetiva a patógenos. A cultivar 



 

 xii

‘Ouro Negro’, de origem Mesoamericana, é a principal fonte de resistência à 

ferrugem utilizada no Brasil.  No entanto, seu gene R (Ur-ON) ainda não foi 

completamente caracterizado em relação a outros já identificados. Neste 

trabalho, inicialmente, ‘Ouro Negro’ e linhagens portadoras de genes R já 

caracterizados foram inoculadas com nove raças de U. appendiculatus.  Além 

disso, o DNA de todas as linhagens de feijão foi analisado com marcadores 

moleculares ligados a Ur-ON, visando identificar evidências adicionais para a 

presença de alelos para esse lócus nas fontes R.  Finalmente, foi testada a 

relação alélica entre Ur-ON e os genes de resistência à ferrugem presentes nas 

linhagens que foram resistentes a pelo menos uma das raças do patógeno.  

Testes de alelismo entre ‘Ouro Negro’ e importantes fontes de resistência à 

ferrugem no Brasil, as quais possuem genes R não caracterizados, foram 

também realizados. Os resultados indicam que o gene de efeito principal que 

condiciona resistência ao U. appendiculatus na cultivar ‘Ouro Negro’ é 

distinto daqueles com os quais ele foi comparado.  5) Melhoramento do 

feijoeiro assistido por marcadores moleculares visando à piramidação de genes 

de resistência à ferrugem – A piramidação de genes R assistida por 

marcadores moleculares foi usada pelo programa de melhoramento do 

feijoeiro conduzido no BIOAGRO/UFV como uma estratégia para acelerar o 

desenvolvimento de linhagens com resistência durável e de amplo espectro à 

ferrugem. Os genes Ur-5 (‘Mexico 309’), Ur-11 (‘BelMiDak RR-3’) e Ur-ON 

(‘Vi-4899’, linhagem do tipo carioca derivada do cruzamento ‘Rudá’ × ‘Ouro 

Negro’) foram combinados na cultivar ‘Rudá’, a qual possui grãos do tipo 

carioca. Foram obtidas linhagens apresentando todas as marcas moleculares 

associadas aos genes R, as quais confirmaram-se resistentes quando 

inoculadas com raças específicas de U. appendiculatus. Estas linhagens 

também foram resistentes em avaliações realizadas em condições de campo. 

Ensaios de rendimento demonstraram que as linhagens obtidas são tão 

produtivas quanto seu genitor recorrente (‘Rudá’) e outras cultivares com 

grãos do tipo carioca atualmente plantadas no Brasil.

SOUZA, Thiago Lívio Pessoa Oliveira de, D.Sc., Universidade Federal de 
Viçosa, August, 2009. SNP discovery, reaction of the common bean to 
soybean rust, and pyramiding of resistance genes to Uromyces

The present work reports results from researches developed at the Common 

Bean Breeding Program of the Federal University of Viçosa (UFV). It is 

composed by distinct sectors or sub-projects.  We have decided to write it in 

the format of scientific papers; one of them is a paper review and the other 

four articles are original reports. They either have been submitted or will be 

submitted for publication in international refereed journals. For this reason, we 

have decided to write them in English, according to the Thesis and 

Dissertations Writing Standards from UFV. Abstracts of these articles 

containing their justifications, objectives, and main results are presented 

below:  1) Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) discovery in the common 

bean – SNPs were discovered in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) via 

resequencing of sequence-tagged sites (STSs) developed by PCR primers 

designed to soybean shotgun and BAC-end sequences, and to common bean 

genes and microsatellite flanking regions. DNA fragments harboring SNPs 

were identified in single amplicons from six contrasting P. vulgaris genotypes 

of the Andean (‘Jalo EEP558’, ‘G19833’, and ‘AND277’) and Mesoamerican 

(‘BAT 93’, ‘DOR 364’, and ‘Rudá’) gene pools.  In the 131,120 bp of aligned 

sequence, a total of 677 SNPs were identified, including 555 single-base 

changes (295 transitions and 260 transversions) and 122 small nucleotide 

insertions/deletions (indels).  The frequency of SNPs was 5.16 SNPs/Kb and 

the mean nucleotide diversity expressed as Halushka’s theta was 0.00226.  

This work represents one of the pioneer efforts aiming to detect SNPs in P.

vulgaris.  2) Resistance to soybean rust in the common bean – Soybean rust 

(SBR) incited by Phakopsora pachyrhizi has been reported in common bean 

cultivars. In this work a set of 44 P. vulgaris genotypes were tested for 

resistance to P. pachyrhizi including resistance sources to several fungal 

common bean diseases, carioca-type, black-type and red-type Brazilian 

commercial cultivars, and advanced lines developed by the BIOAGRO/UFV 

breeding program. Fourteen resistance sources to P. pachyrhizi were 

identified.  ‘PI 181996’, ‘Pérola’, and ‘Redlands Pioneer’ presented the lowest 

mean scores of disease reaction.  The inheritance of SBR resistance in 

‘PI181996’ was studied and the results support the hypothesis that this 

resistance is monogenic and dominant.  3) Breeding for common bean rust 

resistance in the BIOAGRO/UFV, Brazil – Common bean is an economically, 

nutritionally, and socially important crop.  Unfortunately, compared to other 

important grain legumes common bean yields are quite low.  One of the 

several factors contributing to this situation is the high number of destructive 

diseases that attack P. vulgaris and cause serious damage to the crop.  Among 

them is bean rust, incited by the highly variable fungus Uromyces 

appendiculatus.  Bean rust control by plant resistance is an easy and 

economical strategy to be used in association to other rust management 

practices.  This review presents an overview about the bean rust and reports 

some breeding initiatives aiming at the development of rust resistant cultivars 

in the BIOAGRO/UFV.  4) Characterization of the rust resistance gene present 

in the common bean cultivar ‘Ouro Negro’, the main rust resistance source 

used in Brazil – Identification and characterization of new resistance sources 

are basic steps for plant breeding programs aiming to develop modern 

cultivars with effective resistance to pathogens.  The Mesoamerican black 

seeded common bean cultivar ‘Ouro Negro’ is the main rust resistance (RR) 

source used in Brazil, but its resistance gene (Ur-ON) has not been fully 

characterized yet.  Here we have compared the RR spectrum presented by 

‘Ouro Negro’ with those of other bean lines harboring known RR genes when 

inoculated with nine races of U. appendiculatus.  In addition, all bean lines 



 

 xv

were screened with molecular markers linked to Ur-ON aiming to identify 

additional evidence for the presence of alleles for this locus in the screened 

RR sources.  Finally, we tested the allelic relationships of Ur-ON with already 

characterized RR genes from lines resistant to at least one race of the 

pathogen.  We also accomplished allelism tests between ‘Ouro Negro’ and 

important RR sources in Brazil harboring unnamed RR genes. The results 

showed that the major dominant gene conditioning RR in ‘Ouro Negro’ is 

positioned at a locus distinct from those with which it was compared.  5) DNA 

marker-assisted breeding aiming rust resistance gene pyramiding in the 

common bean – In our common bean breeding program we used a gene 

pyramiding approach assisted by DNA markers aiming to develop bean lines 

with durable and ample resistance spectrum to rust. The RR genes Ur-5 (from 

‘Mexico 309’), Ur-11 (from ‘BelMiDak RR-3’), and Ur-ON (from ‘Vi-4899’, 

a carioca seeded line derived from the cross ‘Rudá’ × ‘Ouro Negro’) were 

combined in the carioca-type bean cultivar ‘Rudá’.  Carioca seeded beans are 

the most consumed in the Brazilian market.  We were able to select lines 

presenting all the DNA markers associated to the genes of interest and 

resistant to all of the specific isolates of U. appendiculatus which were tested.  

They were also resistant under field conditions.  Yield evaluations show that 

these selected lines are as productive as the recurrent parent ‘Rudá’ and other 

high performance cultivars currently grown in Brazil.

 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) Discovery in the 

Common Bean 
 

 

Abstract:  Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were discovered in 

common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) via resequencing of sequence-tagged 

sites (STSs) developed by PCR primers designed to soybean shotgun and 

BAC-end sequences, and to common bean genes and microsatellite flanking 

regions.  DNA fragments harboring SNPs were identified in single amplicons 

from six contrasting P. vulgaris genotypes of the Andean (‘Jalo EEP558’, 

‘G19833’, and ‘AND277’) and Mesoamerican (‘BAT 93’, ‘DOR 364’, and 

‘Rudá’) gene pools.  These genotypes are the parents of three common bean 

RIL mapping populations.  From an initial set of 1,880 PCR primer pairs 

tested, 265 robust STSs were obtained, amplified and sequenced in each one 

of the six common bean genotypes.  In the resulting 131,120 bp of aligned 

sequence, a total of 677 SNPs were identified, including 555 single-base 

changes (295 transitions and 260 transversions) and 122 small nucleotide 

insertions/deletions (indels).  The frequency of SNPs was 5.16 SNPs/Kb and 

the mean nucleotide diversity expressed as Halushka’s theta was 0.00226.  

This work represents one of the pioneer efforts aiming to detect SNPs in P. 

vulgaris.  The SNPs identified are an important resource to common bean 

geneticists for quantitative trait loci (QTLs) discovery, marker-assisted 

selection and for map-based cloning.  They will be also useful for diversity 

analysis and microsynteny studies among legume species. 

 

Key words:  DNA polymorphisms – genome variations – molecular markers 

– PCR primers – Phaseolus vulgaris – sequence tagged sites

1.  Introduction 

 

Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), the most important legume directly 

used as a human food, is grown and consumed worldwide but mainly in 

developing countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia.  It is largely a 

subsistence crop used as a major source of dietary protein in these countries, 

as complement to carbohydrate-rich sources such as rice, maize, and cassava.  

The common bean is also an important source of minerals, i.e., iron and zinc, 

and of certain vitamins (Wortmann et al. 1998; Broughton et al. 2003). 

Efficient molecular tools for genetic studies in the common bean are 

still greatly needed.  Single DNA base differences between homologous DNA 

fragments and small nucleotide insertions and deletions (indels) – collectively 

referred as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) – are highly desirable as 

molecular markers because they can be used for in-depth genetic analysis.  

SNPs provide a rich source of DNA polymorphisms in eukaryotic species 

because they are an abundant form of genome variation.  SNPs are 

distinguished from rare genome variations by a requirement that the least 

abundant allele has to present a frequency of 1% or more (Brookes 1999; 

Avise 2004). 

SNPs can be used as biallelic and codominant DNA markers for a 

variety of tasks in crop improvement including genes and quantitative trait loci 

(QTL) discovery, assessment of genetic diversity, association analysis, and 

marker-assisted selection.  SNP markers have two main advantages over other 

molecular markers: (i) they are the most abundant form of genetic variation 

within genomes (Zhu et al. 2003), and (ii) a wide array of technologies have 

now been developed for high throughput SNP analysis (Fan et al. 2006).  In 

addition, SNPs are less unstable than simple sequence repeats (SSR) or 

microsatellite markers because they present lower mutation rate.  For this 

reason, SNPs are useful for population genetics and phylogeny studies (Jin et 

al. 2003).  Another relevant characteristic of the SNP markers is that they can 



 

 3

be transferred between closely related species and utilized for microsynteny 

analysis. 

Large numbers of SNP markers are currently available for many plant 

species including Arabidopsis thaliana (Jander et al. 2002; Schmid et al. 2003, 

2005; Nordborg et al. 2005), maize (Zea mays L.) (Tenaillon et al. 2001; 

Ching et al. 2002; Wright et al. 2005), rice (Oryza sativa L.) (Feltus et al. 

2004), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) (Kanazin et. al. 2002; Rostoks et al. 

2005), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) (Hamblin et al. 2004), soybean (Glycine 

max L.) (Zhu et al. 2003; Choi et al. 2007), sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris L.) 

(Schneider et al. 2001), poplar (Populus trichocarpa Torr. &amp;amp; Gray) (Tuskan et 

al. 2006), apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) (Chagné et al. 2008), and Vitis spp. 

(Fernández et al. 2008).  SNPs have also been detected in the common bean.  

In a recent work, Gaitán-Solís et al. (2008) conducted a sequence analysis of 

10 genotypes of cultivated and wild Mesoamerican and Andean beans.  A total 

of 20,964 bp were analyzed and compared, resulting in the discovery of 372 

SNPs in 41 distinct STSs from coding and noncoding regions of common bean 

DNA sequences obtained from GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and 

generated by degenerate oligonucleotide primers (DOP). 

More than 20,000 SNPs have been discovered in soybean by sequence 

analysis and comparison of sequence tagged sites (STSs) from a small set of 

diverse genotypes.  An initial phase of a large-scale soybean SNP discovery 

effort resulted in the identification of 5,551 SNPs (Zhu et al. 2003; Choi et al. 

2007).  Since then, approximately 12,000 additional soybean SNPs have been 

identified using the same approach (unpublished data).  Because of the 

relatively close relationship between soybean and common bean (Zhu et al. 

2005), it has been reported that many of the soybean-derived STS primers 

would be useful to amplify single amplicons in the common bean genome. 

In this work we used available PCR primers designed to amplify 

soybean shotgun and BAC-end sequences for SNP discovery in common bean.  

This approach aimed to save time and money spent in the initial steps of 

primer development.  In addition, we also used available PCR primers 



 

 4

designed to common bean microsatellite flanking regions.  As reported by Zhu 

et al. (2003), a higher amount of polymorphism is present in non-coding DNA.  

For this reason, microsatellite regions could be a good source of SNPs.  

Finally, we also used PCR primers designed to specific P. vulgaris genes. 

 

2.  Material and Methods 

 

2.1.  Plant material and DNA extraction 

Six contrasting Andean (‘Jalo EEP558’, ‘G19833’, and ‘AND277’) and 

Mesoamerican (‘BAT 93’, ‘DOR 364’, and ‘Rudá’) common bean lines were 

used for SNP discovery.  These lines are the parents of three common bean 

RIL mapping populations: ‘BAT 93’ × ‘Jalo EEP558’, ‘DOR 364’ × 

‘G19833’, and ‘Rudá’ × ‘AND277’.  Seeds from ‘Rudá’ and ‘AND277’ were 

provided by the P. vulgaris Active Germplasm Bank of the BIOAGRO/UFV 

(Viçosa, MG, Brazil).  Seeds from the other common bean lines were provided 

by the Active Germplasm Bank of the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, 

USDA/ARS (Beltsville, MD, USA). 

Genomic DNA was extracted from bulked leaf tissue of five plants of 

each common bean line using the ‘DNeasy Plant Mini’ DNA extraction kit 

(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 

 

2.2.  Sources of PCR primers for STS amplification  

Sequences of the soybean PCR primers were obtained from the Beltsville 

Agricultural Research Center Soybean Map and SNP Database, at 

http://bfgl.anri.barc.usda.gov/soybean/ (Choi et al. 2007).  They were 

randomly selected among STS primers designed to soybean shotgun and 

BAC-end sequences. 

Common bean PCR primer sets designed to microsatellite flanking 

regions were obtained from published data available as of August 2008 on the 

BIC (Bean Improvement Cooperative) website 

(http://www.css.msu.edu/bic/Genetics.cfm).  Aiming to generate significant 



 

 5

information for mapping purpose, SSR primers were selected that have not 

been mapped on the common bean core mapping population (‘BAT 93’ × 

‘Jalo EEP558’) as they did not show size polymorphisms between the parent 

cultivars. 

PCR primers were also designed to amplify common bean candidate 

gene sequences available at pertinent literature to represent a range of 

important agronomic functions.  Full-length gene sequences randomly selected 

from GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) were also used as template to 

design STS primers.  Primers were designed using the software Primer3 

(Whitehead Inst., Cambridge, MA, USA) and Array Designer 2 (Premier 

Biosoft International, Palo Alto, CA, USA) with predicted PCR products 

length adjusted to 400 to 800 bp. 

 

2.3.  Preliminary test of PCR primers and DNA sequence analysis 

All primers pairs designed were initially tested via PCR and agarose gel 

analysis aiming to identify those producing single amplicons.  Amplification 

reactions were performed with 30 ng of genomic DNA from cultivar ‘Jalo 

EEP558’, 1.0 ?M of forward and reverse primers, 1.0 ?L of 2× ‘BioLine B’ 

PCR buffer (BioLine USA Inc., Taunton, MA, USA), 1.5 mM MgCl2, and 2 U 

of homemade Taq DNA polymerase in a 10 ?L reaction volume.  DNA 

amplification assays consisted of: one initial denaturation step at 94ºC for 5 

min; 30 cycles at 94ºC for 45 s, 58ºC (soybean primers) or 54ºC (common 

bean primers) for 1 min, and 72ºC for 1 min; and a final step at 72ºC for 7 

min.  The amplified products were visualized under UV light after 

electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide (0.2 

?g/mL), immersed in a 1× sodium boric acid (SB) buffer (10 mM sodium 

hydroxide, pH adjusted to 8.5 with boric acid).  Reactions with soybean 

primers that gave no products were reamplified at annealing temperature of 

48ºC.  The primer sets that amplified a single discrete product were selected 

for DNA sequence analysis. 



 

 6

The single amplicons from selected PCR primer pairs were prepared for 

sequence analysis by treatment with 4 U of shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP) 

and 4 U of exonuclease I (ExoI) incubated at 37ºC for 1 h followed by 72ºC 

for 15 min to inactivate the enzymes.  Labeling reactions were performed with 

1 ?L of PCR product, 1.0 ?L (4 U) of BigDye Terminator version 3.1 

(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), 1.5 ?M of one of the original 

PCR primers (forward and reverse primers in separate reactions), 0.8 ?L of 

10× ‘Promega’ Taq DNA polymerase buffer (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), 

and 1.75 mM of MgCl2 in a 10 ?L reaction volume.  Labeling reactions 

cycling conditions were as follows: one initial denaturation step at 90ºC for 30 

s; 40 cycles at 90ºC for 10 s, 50ºC for 5 s, and 60ºC for 1 min.  The PCR 

products were labeled from both ends and the resulting termination products 

were sequenced on an ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer.  The two resulting sequence 

traces derived from opposite ends of each amplicon were analyzed and aligned 

with standard DNA analysis software Phred (Ewing and Green 1998) and 

Phrap (http://www.phrap.org/).  Resulting alignments and trace data were 

visually inspected in the Consed viewer (Gordon et al. 1998) to distinguish 

those amplicons that were locus specific and those that apparently resulted 

from amplification of two or more loci.  The primer pairs that produced single 

amplicons with good quality sequence data were used for PCR amplification 

and sequencing of genomic DNA of the other five common bean genotypes: 

‘BAT 93’, ‘DOR 364’, ‘G19833’, ‘Rudá’, and ‘AND277’.  Resulting 

amplicons were treated with SAP/ExoI, sequenced and analyzed as described 

for ‘Jalo EEP558’.  Forward and reverse sequence traces from the six 

genotypes were aligned. 

 

2.4.  STS verification and SNP discovery 

SNP discovery was carried out by sequence alignment using the SNP-PHAGE 

software (Matukumalli et al. 2006).  Sequence traces for each putative SNP 

identified were visually inspected to confirm the sequence polymorphisms.  



 

 7

Single-DNA base changes and indels present in each alignment were recorded 

as described by Matukumalli et al. (2006). 

 A diagram summarizing the SNP discovery strategy used in this work is 

shown in Figure 1.

2.5.  Nucleotide diversity 

Nucleotide diversity (?) was estimated according to Halushka et al. (1999): ? 

= K/aL; where ‘K’ is the number of SNPs identified in an alignment of ‘n’ 

genotypes, ‘L’ is the total length of aligned sequences in bp, and a = ? 1/(i – 

1), with i = 2-to-n. 

 

3.  Results 

 

A total of 1,499 soybean STS primer pairs were tested. Out of them, 513 

(34.22%) amplified each a single PCR product in the common bean genome.  

Out of those, 128 (8.54%) produced high quality sequence data. The total 

length of aligned sequences was 66,085 bp and the mean length of each 

amplicon was 516 bp.  Two hundred and seventy-seven SNPs were identified 

in 81 (5.40%) distinct DNA fragments. The frequency of SNPs was 4.19 

SNPs/Kb and the nucleotide diversity expressed as Halushka’s theta was 

0.00184 (Table 1). 

Out of the 168 PCR primer pairs designed for common bean gene 

sequences, 109 (64.88%) amplified each a single discrete amplicon and 66 

(39.29%) of them were selected after the DNA sequence analysis.  The total 

length of aligned sequences was 38,167 bp and the mean length of STSs was 

578 bp. A total of 237 SNPs were identified in 48 (28.57%) distinct DNA 

fragments. The frequency of SNPs was 6.21 SNPs/Kb and the nucleotide 

diversity was ? = 0.00272 (Table 2). 

Seven hundred and fifty-eight P. vulgaris SSR primer pairs were tested 

and 477 (62.93%) of them amplified a single DNA band. Because the DNA 

sequencing platform used (ABI 3730) was not efficient to sequence small 

amplicons (&amp;lt;200 bp), only bands &gt; 200 bp (213) were selected for DNA 

sequence analysis. Out of them, 71 (33.33%) produced high quality 

sequencing data. The total length of aligned sequences was 26,868 bp and the 

mean length of single amplicons was 378 bp. One hundred and sixty-three 

SNPs were identified in 44 (20.66%) distinct fragments. The frequency of 



 

 9

SNPs was 6.07 SNPs/Kb and the nucleotide diversity was ? = 0.00266 (Table 

3). 

The results obtained using all 1880 distinct PCR primer pairs are 

summarized in Table 4.  The aligned sequence of the 265 (14.10%) STSs 

resulted in the discovery of 677 SNPs in 173 (9.20%) distinct DNA fragments.  

The final length of aligned sequences was 131,120 bp and the mean length of 

the single amplicons was 495 bp.  The final value of the frequency of SNPs 

was 5.16 SNPs/Kb and the mean nucleotide diversity was ? = 0.00226. 

The SNP classes are shown in Table 5.  Out of the 277 SNPs identified 

in DNA fragments generated with soybean STS primers, 123 (44.40%) are 

transitions (A?G and C?T), 118 (42.60%) are transversions (A?C, A?T, 

C?G, and G?T), and 36 (13.00%) are indels.  Among the 237 SNPs found in 

amplicons produced by primers designed to common bean genes, 109 

(46.00%) transitions, 88 (37.13%) transversions, and 40 (16.87%) indels were 

detected.  Of the 163 SNPs identified in PCR products generated by common 

bean SSR primers, 63 (38.65%) are transitions, 54 (33.13%) are transversions, 

and 46 (28.22%) are indels.  Of a total of 677 SNPs identified in this work, 

295 (43.57%) are transitions, 260 (38.41%) transversions, and 122 (18.02%) 

indels.

4.  Discussion 

 

As part of an international effort led by the Soybean Genomics and 

Improvement Laboratory (SGIL), USDA/ARS, aiming to develop SNP 

markers for P. vulgaris, primers designed to soybean shotgun and BAC-end 

sequences, to common bean genes and flanking SSR regions were examined 

for locus-specific PCR amplification followed by resequencing of resulting 

amplicons.  The use of available PCR primers (soybean STSs and common 

bean SSR primers) aimed to save time and money spent in the initial steps of 

primer development.  However, considering the soybean-derived primers, only 

5.40% of them produced DNA fragments with at least one SNP (Table 1).  

Despite the advantages mentioned above and the relatively close relationship 

of the soybean and common bean genomes (Zhu et al. 2005), the approach 

using soybean-derived primers was not as productive as originally anticipated.  

The low rate of SNP discovery reported here was, mainly, the result of the 

inability to develop robust STSs using these primers (Table 1). 

The recent development of a large number of common bean SSR 

markers provided a valuable resource of STSs for SNP discovery.  Out of the 

SSR primer sets available as of August 2008 and with sequences deposited in 

the BIC website (http://www.css.msu.edu/bic/Genetics.cfm), we selected those 

that had not been mapped in the bean core mapping population as they did not 

reveal size polymorphisms.  Our goal with this selection was to generate 

information useful to increase the saturation of P. vulgaris core genetic map.  

Of a total of 785 SSR primer pairs tested in this work, 62.93% were 

determined to produce a single discrete PCR product.  This high percentage 

was already expected since the primers had been previously identified and/or 

validated in common bean.  However, because the utilized DNA sequencing 

platform (ABI 3730) was not efficient to sequence small amplicons, we were 

able to use only 28.10% (213) of the SSR primer sets (PCR products &gt; 200 

bp).  These 213 SSR primer pairs were used for sequence analysis of the six 

contrasting P. vulgaris genotypes, and 20.66% produced single amplicons 



 

 15

with good quality DNA sequence data and containing at least one SNP (Table 

3). 

Of a total of 168 primer sets designed to common bean gene sequences 

and examined for locus-specific PCR amplification followed by resequencing 

for SNP discovery, 28.57% were determined to contain a sequence variant 

(Table 2).  The efficiency of the common bean-derived PCR primers in result 

an SNP-containing amplicon was higher than that observed in soybean 

(21.50%) using the same strategy (Choi et al. 2007).  The high level of 

duplication in the soybean genome complicates the development of robust 

STSs and can be the main explanation for this discrepancy.   

The aligned sequence from all 265 STSs (131,120 bp) obtained from 

the six common bean genotypes resulted in the discovery of 677 SNPs in 173 

DNA fragments (Table 4).  Approximately 81.98% of the SNPs were single-

base changes of which 43.57% were transitions and 38.41% transversions.  

The remaining 18.02% SNPs were indels (Table 5).  The proportion of SNP 

classes detected here is similar to that reported in soybean (47.28% transitions, 

37.61% transversions, and 15.11% indels) by Choi et al. (2007), but it differs 

significantly from that previously reported in common bean (31.45% 

transitions, 35.75% transversions, and 32.80% indels) by Gaitán-Solís et al. 

(2008).  

The nucleotide diversity verified in this work (? = 0.00226) in the 

analyzed 131,160 bp of common bean DNA sequence is approximately twice 

as higher than that detected in soybean by Zhu et al. (2003) (? = 0.00086), 

Hyten et al. (2006) (? = 0.00115), and Choi et al. (2007) (? = 0.00010).  

However, a similar level of nucleotide diversity was verified in rice (? = 

0.00181) (Feltus et al. 2004), barley (? = 0.00250) (Kanazin et al. 2002), and 

sorghum (? = 0.00230) (Hamblin et al. 2004).  Higher nucleotide diversity 

levels have also been reported in maize (? = 0.00627) (Wright et al. 2005) and 

sugarbeet (? = 0.00770) (Schneider et al. 2001).  A high nucleotide diversity 

value (? = 0.00627) was reported for common bean (Gaitán-Solís et al. 2008), 

similar to that detected in maize.  This higher diversity level detected by these 



 

 16

authors can be explained by the use of 10 highly diverse cultivated and wild 

bean genotypes from Mesoamerican and Andean origins. 

It is important to highlight that the SNPs identified in the present work 

are not putative genome variations.  They are real DNA polymorphisms that 

will be useful for genetic mapping, diversity analysis, and microsynteny 

studies among legume species.  Additional information about these SNPs, i.e., 

their forward and reserve primers and respective SNP-containing amplicon 

sequences are available upon request.  Currently, SNP discovery approaches 

using reduced representation libraries and high throughput sequence analysis 

on the Illumina Genome Analyzer are being undertaken at SGIL.  In the near 

future analysis of the common bean SNPs developed in this work and others 

will be tested in the common bean germplasm using the SNP GoldenGate 

assay on the Ilumina BeadStation.  In this assay it is possible to multiplex 

from 96 to 1,536 SNPs in a single reaction over a 3-day period (Fan et al. 

2003).  For this reason, it can be used for high throughput SNP genotyping.  

The Illumina GoldenGate assay has been demonstrated to function well with 

the complex paleopolyploid genome of soybean (Hyten et al. 2008), thus it 

should also work for a less complex genome as is the case of the common 

bean.  These data will certainly boost the common bean genetic mapping 

efforts aiming at QTL discovery and map-based cloning, as well as the use of 

marker-assisted selection for cultivar development.

Resistance to Soybean Rust in the Common Bean 
 

 

Abstract:  Soybean rust (SBR) incited by Phakopsora pachyrhizi has been 

reported in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) cultivars inoculated under 

controlled and natural-field conditions in South Africa, the United States, 

Argentina and Brazil.  Although the SBR is currently not a serious problem to 

the common bean crop, many bean breeders are concerned about this 

possibility because of the high severity and virulence diversity of P. 

pachyrhizi, and its broad host range.  In this work a set of 44 P. vulgaris 

genotypes were tested for resistance to P. pachyrhizi including resistance 

sources to several fungal common bean diseases, carioca-type, black-type and 

red-type Brazilian commercial cultivars, and advanced lines developed by the 

BIOAGRO/UFV breeding program.  Fourteen resistance sources to P. 

pachyrhizi were identified.  ‘PI 181996’, ‘Pérola’, and ‘Redlands Pioneer’ 

presented the lowest mean scores of disease reaction.  ‘PI181996’ was crossed 

with susceptible cultivars aiming to study the inheritance of resistance in this 

common bean accession.  The results support the hypothesis that resistance to 

P. pachyrhizi in ‘PI181996’ is monogenic and dominant. 

 

Key words:  Phakopsora pachyrhizi – Phaseolus vulgaris – disease resistance 

– resistance source – inheritance study – prebreeding

1.  Introduction 

 

Soybean rust (SBR), incited by the highly variable fungus Phakopsora 

pachyrhizi H. Sydow &amp;amp; P. Sydow, is reported as the major disease limiting 

soybean (Glycine max L.) production in Asia (Hartman et al. 1992) and, most 

recently, in the Americas.  Since the first detection of P. pachyrhizi incidence 

associated with rust epidemics in the American continent, the pathogen has 

moved swiftly from one country to the other.  SBR was first reported in 

Paraguay and Brazil in 2001, after in the Argentina (2002), Bolivia (2003), 

Uruguay and the US (2004), and in Mexico (2005) (Ivancovich 2005; Pivonia 

and Yang 2005; Schneider et al. 2005; Yorinori et al. 2005).  In Brazil, SBR 

was first found and disseminated in the south-central areas.  In May 2001, it 

was detected in the west region of the state of Paraná.  In the 2001/2002 crop 

season, the disease was already found on all soybean fields of Paraná and in 

some areas of the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Goiás, Mato Grosso, and Mato 

Grosso do Sul.  Yield losses due to soybean rust ranged from 30 to 75% 

(Yorinori et al. 2005).  Currently, SBR is endemic in almost all Brazilian 

soybean growing areas and all soybean commercial cultivars are susceptible to 

P. pachyrhizi. 

Control measures for SBR include cultural practices (crop rotation, soil 

incorporation of soybean infected debris, planting within recommended dates, 

etc.), growing tolerant cultivars, and timely spraying of fungicides (Hartman et 

al. 1992).  Compared to chemical control, the most utilized method to date, the 

use of resistant cultivars not only is harmless to the environment but also an 

economically sound strategy.  But the high severity and variability of the 

pathogen prevent the efficient control of P. pachyrhizi by plant resistance and 

the identification of effective-resistance sources in soybean. 

The host range of P. pachyrhizi is broad, with over 90 species, 

including some economically important crops (Ono et al. 1992; Rytter et al. 

1984).  Among them is the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), the food 

legume most used for direct human consumption worldwide. The 



 

 22

pathogenicity of P. pachyrhizi has been reported on P. vulgaris cultivars gown 

under field and controlled conditions, and tested by natural and artificial 

inoculations with the pathogen.  The first report on the virulence of P. 

pachyrhizi on common bean lines inoculated under controlled conditions was 

done by Stavely et al. (1985).  Most recently, SBR was reported on common 

bean accessions grown under natural-field conditions in South Africa, Brazil, 

and the USA (2005), and Argentina (2006) (DuPreez et al. 2005; Nunes Junior 

et al. 2005; Lynch et al. 2006; Pastor-Corrales et al. 2006, 2007; Ivancovich et 

al. 2007). 

In the research developed by Miles et al. (2007), common bean 

cultivars resistant to bean rust, incited by Uromyces appendiculatus F. Strauss 

(syn. U. phaseoli G. Winter), were tested against six isolates of P. pachyrhizi 

from Asia, Africa, and South America.  Resistance to all six isolates was 

identified.  As previously reported by Stavely et al. (1985), when lesion sizes 

and spore production were compared between soybean and common bean 

susceptible cultivars inoculated with virulent P. pachyrhizi isolates, the bean 

cultivars presented smaller lesions and less spores.  According to Stavely et al. 

(1985), when these same rust symptoms were compared on susceptible 

common bean cultivars inoculated with P. pachyrhizi and U. appendiculatus, 

the SBR pathogen incited smaller lesions with less spore production than those 

incited by the bean rust pathogen.  It was concluded that P. pachyrhizi is not a 

threat to common bean production unlike U. appendiculatus.  The smaller 

severity of SBR on P. vulgaris compared to G. max accessions using natural 

inoculation assays under field conditions was also reported by DuPreez et al. 

(2005), Nunes Junior et al. (2005), Lynch et al. (2006), Pastor-Corrales et al. 

(2006, 2007), and Ivancovich et al. (2007).  Nevertheless, because the high 

virulence diversity of P. pachyrhizi, in addition to its broad host range and 

great dispersal capacity, many bean breeders are concerned about the 

possibility that SBR also becomes a serious problem to the common bean crop 

in endemic areas. 



 

 23

A similar phenomenon was already reported in the common bean 

growing system.  The angular leaf spot, incited by the fungus 

Pseudocercospora griseola (Sacc.) Crous &amp;amp; U. Braun, was already considered 

as one of the least important diseases for the bean crop until approximately 20 

years ago.  However, to date angular leaf spot is one of the most destructive 

fungal diseases affecting the common bean production in Brazil and other 

tropical and sub-tropical growing areas of the world (Sartorato 2002).  In 

Brazil, yield losses caused by P. griseola may reach between 70% and 100% 

(Jesus Junior et al. 2001). 

Based on the reported information, the identification and use of SBR 

resistance sources in P. vulgaris is being considered as strategic for the 

common bean breeding programs focused on disease resistance.  In addition, 

considering the current possibilities presented by the modern biotechnology 

tools, this effort may also lead to the development of transgenic soybean 

cultivars with effective resistance to P. pachyrhizi. 

The main goal of the present work was to identify SBR resistance 

sources among common bean accessions maintained in the P. vulgaris Active 

Germplasm Bank of the BIOAGRO/UFV (Instituto de Biotecnologia Aplicada 

à Agropecuária of the Universidade Federal de Viçosa).  To better understand 

the genetic control of plant resistance in the pathosystem P. pachyrhizi–P. 

vulgaris, we also determined the inheritance mode of SBR resistance in the 

common bean accession ‘PI181996’, one of the resistant sources identified in 

this work.

2.  Material and Methods 

 

2.1.  Plant genetic material 

Characteristics of the common bean accessions screened for SBR resistance in 

the present work are summarized in Table 1.  Among the accessions there are: 

resistance sources to common bean diseases, such as rust, anthracnose, and 

angular leaf spot; Brazilian commercial cultivars with carioca-type, black-

type, and red-type genetic backgrounds; and advanced lines developed by the 

BIOAGRO/UFV breeding program. 

Seeds from the differential cultivars for bean rust (Table 1) were 

provided by the Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical - CIAT (Cali, 

Colombia).  Seeds from cultivars ‘IAPAR 14’, ‘IAPAR 16’, and ‘IAPAR 57’ 

were provided by Dr. Vania Moda-Cirino of the Instituto Agronômico do 

Paraná - IAPAR (Londrina, Paraná, Brazil).  Seeds from the other common 

bean lines were supplied by BIOAGRO/UFV (Viçosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil).   

Soybean cultivars ‘CAC-1’ and ‘Cristalina’ were used as susceptible 

control in the SBR resistance screening as they are highly susceptible to P. 

pachyrhizi under field condition in Brazil.  Soybean lines harboring the four 

identified single resistance genes to the pathogen were also included in the 

inoculation assays: ‘PI200492’ (gene Rpp1); ‘PI547878’ (gene Rpp2), line 

derived from ‘Willians’ (susceptible) and ‘PI230970’ (gene Rpp2); ‘PI462312’ 

(gene Rpp3); and ‘PI459025’ (gene Rpp4).  Seeds from all soybean accessions 

were also provided by BIOAGRO/UFV. 

In order to standardize their vigor and germination power, seeds from 

all common bean and soybean accessions were multiplied under greenhouse 

conditions before the disease screening tests.  Ten plants from each accession 

were inoculated with the pathogen.

2.2.  P. pachyrhizi inoculum 

The initial inoculum of P. pachyrhizi was obtained from soybean cultivar 

‘CAC-1’ plants infected under field conditions in UFV experimental stations 

located in Viçosa, Coimbra and Tocantins, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil.  The 

spores were periodically multiplied on cultivar ‘CAC-1’ in order to increase 

the inoculum and maintain its virulence.  Since the inoculum is not a single-

pustule isolate, i.e., it did not originate from a single lesion, it is possible that it 

represents a mixture of more than one pathotype.  Therefore, all 

multiplications of the inoculum as well as disease screening tests were 

monitored for the appearance of mixed lesions or highly contrasting reaction 

degrees on a same soybean or common bean genotype. 

Although P. pachyrhizi does not grow in artificial culture as it is an 

obligate parasite, viable spores can be preserved under artificial conditions.  In 

the BIOAGRO/UFV, dry spores in plastic or glass tubes are being successfully 

maintained under dark conditions at -80°C or in liquid nitrogen. 

Genomic DNA of spores obtained from the inoculum used in this work 

was utilized for PCR analysis with specific primers designed to amplify ITS 

(Internal Transcribed Spacer) regions of P. pachyrhizi (Asian SBR) and P. 

meibomiae (Arthur) Arthur (American SBR) (Frederick et al. 2002).  

Differentiation between Asian SBR and American SBR symptoms by visual 

evaluation only is not efficient (Ono et al. 1992).  Fungal DNA extraction and 

PCR conditions were as described by Frederick et al. (2002).  The primers 

used in the test were: Ppm1 (5’-GCAGAATTCAGTGAATCATCAAG-3’) 

and Ppa2 (5’-GCAACACTCAAAATCCAACAAT-3’), for the P. pachyrhizi-

specific assay, and Ppm1 and Pme2 (5’-CTCAAACAGGTGTACCTTTTGG-

3’), for the P. meibomiae-specific assay.  Each DNA amplification assay 

consisted of: one initial denaturation step at 94ºC for 3 min; 30 cycles at 94ºC 

for 1 min, 57ºC for 1 min, 72ºC for 1 min and 30 s; and a final step at 72ºC for 

7 min.  The electrophoresis analyses were performed in 3.0% agarose gel 

containing ethidium bromide (0.2 ?g/mL), immersed in a 1X sodium boric 

acid (SB) buffer (10 mM sodium hydroxide, pH adjusted to 8.5 with boric 



 

 29

acid).  DNA template control of P. pachyrhizi and P. meibomiae were 

provided by Dr. Ricardo Abdelnoor of the Embrapa Soja (Londrina, Paraná, 

Brazil).   

 

2.3.  Inoculation and disease screening 

The primary leaves and the first trifolium of all plants were inoculated about 

15 days after sowing under greenhouse conditions (20 ± 5°C).  Prior to 

inoculation, spores were removed from storage conditions (-80°C), heat 

shocked at 40ºC for 10 min, and hydrated by incubating in a small plastic 

weigh boat over water for 24 h.  The inoculum concentration was 3.0 × 105 P. 

pachyrhizi spores/mL distilled water containing Tween-20 (0.05%, v:v).  The 

inoculum was sprayed on both leaf surfaces using a manual atomizer (De 

Vilbiss no 15) powered by an electric compressor.  After inoculation the plants 

were transferred to a mist chamber (20 ± 1°C and relative humidity &gt; 95%) 

where they were kept for 48 h under a 12-hour light regime.  After this period 

the plants were transferred to a greenhouse (20 ± 5°C), where they were kept 

until symptom evaluation. 

Disease symptoms were evaluated at 15, 20 and 25 days after the 

inoculations based on a 1-to-5 scale modified from Stavely (1985).  In this 

scale, 1 = no sporulation, 2 = sporulation present but less than 10% of fully 

sporulating lesions, 3 = sporulation present and 11 to 25% of fully sporulating 

lesions, 4 = sporulation present and 26 to 40% of fully sporulating lesions, and 

5 = sporulation present and 65 to 100% of fully sporulating lesions. 

Rust lesions in both surfaces of the inoculated leaves were determined 

visually by at least two independent evaluators.  Individual plants with degrees 

1-to-3 were considered resistance, whereas those with degrees 4 or 5 were 

considered susceptible.  When different plants of the same accession were 

evaluated, accessions presenting mean scores of disease reaction ? 3.00 were 

considered resistance and those with mean scores &gt; 3.00, susceptible. 



 

 30

2.4.  Crosses and genetic analysis of F1, F2 and F3 generations 

Inheritance of SBR resistance in the common bean accession ‘PI181996’ was 

studied by crossing this resistance source with the susceptible cultivars ‘US 

Pinto 111’ and ‘Mexico 309’.  The plants were grown and artificially crossed 

under greenhouse condition. 

All F1 plants from the cross ‘PI181996’ × ‘US Pinto 111’ were 

analyzed morphologically (flower color).  Because ‘PI181996’ and ‘Mexico 

309’ are black seeded beans with similar flower color and other morphological 

traits, the F1 plants derived from the crosses between them were analyzed with 

RAPD markers as proposed by Alzate-Marin et al. (1996).  As ‘Mexico 309’ 

was used as female parent, the presence in the F1 plant of a PCR product 

which was present only in ‘PI181996’ confirmed that the plant was indeed a 

hybrid.  Plant DNA samples were extracted according to Doyle and Doyle 

(1990).  DNA amplification by the RAPD technique was accomplished 

according to Alzate-Marin et al. (1996) and the electrophoresis analyses were 

done on 1.2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide (0.2 ?g/mL), 

immersed in a 1X SB buffer.  All selected F1 plants were used to obtain the F2 

and then the F3 populations. 

Plants from F2 and F3 populations, soybean control cultivars ‘CAC-1’ 

and ‘Cristalina’, and the parental common bean lines were inoculated with P. 

pachyrhizi and screened for SBR reaction.  The ratio of resistant and 

susceptible reactions observed in the segregating population was tested for 

goodness-of-fit to theoretical ratios with Chi-square (?2) test.

3.  Results 

 

3.1.  Phakopsora spp. molecular detection test 

PCR analysis using genomic DNA of spores from the inoculum used in this 

work and ITS region-specific primers for P. pachyrhizi and P. meibomiae 

detection, previously reported by Frederick et al. (2002), was efficiently 

accomplished.  The results are shown in Figure 1.  The amplification of PCR 

products only with P. pachyrhizi-specific primers confirmed that the inoculum 

used for SBR resistance screening is indeed from P. pachyrhizi.  

  

3.2.  Reaction of common bean accessions to P. pachyrhizi 

Out of the 44 common bean accessions tested against the SBR pathogen, 14 

were considered resistant (mean scores of disease reaction ? 3.00) and the 

other 30 accessions were considered to be susceptible (mean scores of disease 

reaction &gt; 3.00) (Table 2). 

None of the common bean accessions presented immune reaction to P. 

pachyrhizi (Table 2).  However, three resistant lines, ‘PI181996’, ‘Pérola’ and 

‘Redlands Pioneer’, were considered to be promising sources for resistance to 

SBR.  They presented mean scores of disease reaction of 2.25 ± 0.26, 2.20 ± 

0.41, and 2.20 ± 0.35, respectively (Table 2).  On the other hand, 15 P. 

vulgaris susceptible accessions were identified: ‘AND 277’, ‘Cornell 49-242’, 

‘California Small White 643’, ‘Diamante Negro’, ‘Dorado’, ‘Mexico 309’, 

‘Mexico 54’, ‘Ouro Vermelho’, ‘PI260418’, ‘Pinto Olathe’, ‘Rudá’, ‘SEL 

1308’, ‘TU’, ‘US Pinto 111’, and ‘Vermelhinho’.  They presented mean scores 

of disease reaction equal or greater than 4.50 (Table 2).

inoculum used in this work.  PCR products between 100 and 200-bp are 
present in lanes 2A and 4A, and 3B. 
 

 

All soybean cultivars presented susceptible reaction to the SBR 

pathogen, showing high mean scores of disease reaction, including the lines 

harboring the resistance genes Rpp1, Rpp2, Rpp3, and Rpp4 (Table 2).  As 

previously reported by Stavely et al. (1985) and Miles et al. (2007), the 

soybean cultivars presented lesion sizes and spore production greater than 

those presented by the common bean susceptible accessions (data not shown). 

 Although the inoculum used for disease screening tests did not originate 

from a single pustule, no mixed lesion types or highly contrasting reaction 

degrees were observed on plants from a same soybean or common bean 

accession.  This could be verified by analyzing the standard error values 

associated to the mean scores of disease reaction (Table 2).

3.3.  Inheritance study 

Two hundred and forty-six F2 plants derived from the cross ‘US Pinto 111’ × 

‘PI181996’ and 46 F2 plants from the cross ‘Mexico 309’ × ‘PI181996’ were 

tested against the SBR pathogen.  The segregation for P. pachyrhizi resistance 

on both F2 populations fit a 3 resistant: 1 susceptible ratio (3R_:1rr) with ?
2 

values of 0.0487 and 0.0289, and probability (P) values of 82.52% and 

86.48%, respectively (Table 3). 

One hundred and seven F3 plants from the crosses between ‘US Pinto 

111’ and ‘PI181996’ and 162 F3 plants resulting from the cross ‘Mexico 309’ 

× ‘PI181996’ were also inoculated.  A 5R_:3rr segregation ratio was observed 

on the F3 populations with ?
2 values of 0.0006 and 0.5942, and P values of 

98.01% and 44.08%, respectively (Table 3). 

These results support the hypothesis that resistance to P. pachyrhizi in 

the common bean accession ‘PI181996’ is controlled by a single gene with 

intra-allelic relationship of complete dominance.

4.  Discussion 

 

In a pilot experiment aiming to identify SBR resistance sources in P. vulgaris 

to be better characterized and potentially explored by common bean and 

soybean breeding programs, here we screened 44 accessions from the P. 

vulgaris Active Germplasm Bank of the BIOAGRO/UFV with P. pachyrhizi.  

Three accessions were selected as promising resistance sources because their 

low disease reactions expressed in mean scores of infection degree (1-to-5 

degrees) and their respective standard error values: ‘PI181996’ (2.25 ± 0.26), 

‘Pérola’ (2.20 ± 0.41), and ‘Redlands Pioneer’ (2.20 ± 0.35) (Table 2).  

‘PI181996’ has already been reported as resistance to six isolates of P. 

pachyrhizi from Taiwan, Thailand, Zimbabwe, Paraguay, and Brazil when 

inoculated under controlled conditions in the USA (Miles et al. 2007).  This 

resistance source also presented no visible SBR symptoms in experiments 

using natural-field inoculation carried out in Brazil and South Africa (Nunes 

Junior et al. 2005; Pastor-Corrales et al. 2006, 2007). 

Because the lowest mean score of disease reaction of ‘PI181996’ 

observed in this work, considering its associated standard error value, it was 

used in inheritance studies to elucidate the genetic control of its resistance to 

P. pachyrhizi.  Crosses between ‘PI181996’ and the susceptible cultivars ‘US 

Pinto 111’ (4.75 ± 0.26) and ‘Mexico 309’ (4.55 ± 0.16) (Table 2) were done.  

The segregating populations F2 and F3 were obtained from these two crosses 

and screened with the pathogen.  The results showed that SBR resistance in 

‘PI181996’ is monogenic and dominant. 

It was also verified in this work that, in general, resistance to P. 

pachyrhizi is not correlated to resistance to other fungal common bean 

diseases, such as rust, anthracnose and angular leaf spot (Tables 1 and 2).  

Although some carioca-type advanced lines developed by BIOAGRO/UFV 

presented resistance, it is possible that most bean lines now being developed in 

Brazil will be susceptible to the pathogen, as the carioca-type, black-type and 



 

 36

red-type cultivars (parental lines) currently grown in the country were 

susceptible to P. pachyrhizi (Tables 1 and 2). 

SBR is not a serious problem to bean crop to date, but the results 

reported here indicate that works aiming to identify and explore resistance 

sources in P. vulgaris may be considered as strategic for the common bean 

breeding programs.  Additionally, this effort may also help the development of 

transgenic soybean cultivars with effective resistance to P. pachyrhizi since 

the single dominant resistance genes identified in soybean (Rpp1, Rpp2, Rpp3, 

and Rpp4) condition resistance to a limited set of rust pathotypes and the 

resistance has not shown to be durable (Hartman et al. 2005). This would 

obviously demand the cloning of the gene(s) conferring resistance to SBR in 

the common bean and its (their) transfer to the soybean genome. The 

differential response to P. pachyrhizi presented by the P. vulgaris accessions 

also suggests that some of them could be used as differentials cultivars for 

classification of the fungus physiological races. 

The Phakopsora spp. molecular detection test confirms that the spores 

used in our inoculation assays are indeed from P. pachyrhizi (Figure 1).  Since 

we did not use a single-pustule isolate for the SBR resistance screening, it was 

possible that the inoculum represented a mixture of many pathotypes 

difficulting the disease evaluating process.  But no mixed lesions or highly 

contrasting reaction degrees on a same soybean or common bean genotype 

were observed in the greenhouse inoculations, as shown by the standard error 

values associated to the mean scores of disease reaction presented in Table 2.  

The results from our inheritance studies also showed that the inoculum was 

efficient to detect the monogenic dominant nature of the resistance to P. 

pachyrhizi in ‘PI181996’ (Table 3).  However, we cannot discard that a gene 

cluster or complex loci (closely linked genes) governs SBR resistance in this 

common bean line. 

Based on the results obtained from Stavely et al. (1985), Miles et al. 

(2007), and Pastor-Corrales et al. (2007) that indicated the common bean line 

‘CNC’ as a promising resistance source to P. pachyrhizi, Pastor-Corrales and 



 

 37

Frederick (2008) analyzed the segregating resistance pattern to P. pachyrhizi 

among 241 F2 plants derived from crosses between susceptible cultivar 

‘Mexico 309’ and ‘CNC’.  The results showed that the SBR resistance in 

‘CNC’ is controlled by the interaction of two genes with complete dominance 

at both gene pairs: one dominant allele of each two genes is necessary to 

produce the resistant phenotype but either recessive homozygote is epistatic to 

the other gene.  Additional assays analyzing other segregating generation are 

being carried out to confirm these results (Dr. Marcial A. Pastor-Corrales, 

personal communication). 

Currently, fungicide spraying is the only effective method to control 

SBR worldwide.  This strategy increases production costs and exposes the 

environment to high levels of chemicals.  As a first step towards the 

development of common bean cultivars resistant to SBR, we identified 

resistance sources and studied the genetic basis of this resistance in P. 

vulgaris.  To date we are working on the identification of molecular markers 

linked to the resistance gene present in ‘PI181996’ aiming their utilization for 

marker-assisted selection.  We are also conducing additional inheritance 

studies using a P. pachyrhizi single-pustule isolate recently obtained by our 

group.  Additionally, other P. vulgaris accessions are being screened aiming at 

the identification of effective resistance to the disease.

Breeding for Common Bean Rust Resistance in the 

BIOAGRO/UFV, Brazil 
 

 

Abstract:  Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is an economically, 

nutritionally, and socially important crop. It is grown in distinct regions and 

different seasons around the world by subsistence level farmers with low-

technology input as well as by farmers that use high input technologies. 

Unfortunately, compared to other important grain legumes common bean 

yields are quite low. One of the several factors contributing to this situation is 

the high number of destructive diseases that attack P. vulgaris and cause 

serious damage to the crop. Among them is bean rust, incited by the highly 

variable fungus Uromyces appendiculatus. This disease is distributed 

throughout the world, but it effectively causes major production problems in 

humid tropical and subtropical regions. In Brazil, rust causes major losses in 

south, southeast, and central regions of the country. Bean rust control by plant 

resistance is an easy and economical strategy to be used in association to other 

rust management practices. The pyramiding of different race-specific 

resistance genes in association with other genes conferring adult plant 

resistance, slow rusting, and reduced pustule size can prolong the lifespan of a 

common bean cultivar by creating a more durable resistance complex against 

the rust pathogen. This review presents an overview about the bean rust and 

reports some breeding initiatives aiming at the development of rust resistant 

cultivars in the BIOAGRO/UFV, Minas Gerais, Brazil.

1.  Introduction 

 

The common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is the most important legume 

directly used for human consumption worldwide. Among the five 

domesticated and grown species of the genus Phaseolus, a genus comprised of 

some 70 species (Freytag and Debouck 2002), P. vulgaris accounts for more 

than 90% of the cultivated crop in the world (Singh et al. 1991a, 2001). Dry 

bean cultivars of the species P. vulgaris were grown and consumed on 

approximately 27 million hectares in more than 120 countries in 2007 

(http://faostat.fao.org). The social value of the common bean is extremely high 

to millions of people in many countries and most especially in developing 

countries of Latin America, and Eastern and Southern Africa (Pachico 1989; 

Wortmann et al. 1998; Broughton et al. 2003). In Brazil, the main producer 

and consumer country (http://www.fao.org), dry beans are the main source of 

vegetable protein, minerals, and vitamins for a major proportion of the 

population. The set of essential amino acids present in dry bean seeds is 

complementary to that in grains of cereals such as rice (Oryza sativa L.). 

 Some bean seed properties have been shown to contribute positively to 

major health issues, such as the control of type II diabetes. Regular bean 

consumption also lowers glycemic and cholesterolemic indices and decreases 

the incidence of certain types of cancer (Andersen et al. 1984; Hangen and 

Bennink 2003). 

 The attack of pests and pathogens is one of the main causes of yield and 

quality losses in the common bean crop worldwide (Stavely and Pastor-

Corrales 1989). This is especially true for small farmers with low-technology 

inputs, which play an important role, as they account for the greatest fraction 

of the product for the world market supply (http://faostat.fao.org). Among the 

most serious diseases that attack common bean we find bean rust, incited by 

the highly variable fungus Uromyces appendiculatus F. Strauss (syn. U. 

phaseoli G. Winter). This disease is distributed throughout the world, but it 

effectively causes major production problems in humid tropical and 



 

 43

subtropical areas and periodic severe epidemics in humid temperate regions 

(Souza et al. 2008). Severe bean rust epidemics have been reported in Brazil 

and other Latin American countries as well as in Australia, China, the United 

States, and some areas of Europe (Stavely and Pastor-Corrales 1989). 

 According to Lindgren et al. (1995) a 1% increase in bean rust severity 

leads to a yield loss of approximately 19 kg/ha. The major losses in Brazil 

occur in south, southeast and central areas, including the states of Paraná, Rio 

Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Minas Gerais, São Paulo, and Goiás (Souza et 

al. 2005a). Yield losses higher than 68% have been detected in the state of 

Minas Gerais located in the southeast region of the country (Vieira et al. 

2005). 

No single cost-effective or efficient control measure can be 

recommended to prevent rust infection in all cases or different regions. 

Disease management practices for bean rust control include crop rotation, soil 

incorporation of bean debris, planting within recommended dates, growing 

resistant cultivars, and timely spraying of fungicides (Mmbaga et al. 1996). 

Compared to chemical control the use of plant resistance not only is 

harmless to the environment but also an economically sound strategy. 

However, the wide variability of U. appendiculatus represents an obstacle to 

breeders aiming at the development of common bean cultivars with durable 

resistance to rust. The combination of different rust resistance (RR) genes in 

the same cultivar has been proposed as an important strategy for obtaining 

effective and durable genetic resistance to rust (Johnson 1984; Stavely and 

Pastor-Corrales 1989; Kelly et al. 1995; Souza et al. 2005b, 2007a). This can 

be accomplished by gene pyramiding, when distinct genes are combined in the 

same cultivar, or by using multilines, when different genes are transferred to 

different lines of the same cultivar. For gene pyramiding, knowledge about the 

inheritance and organization of the genes and also the use of proper selection 

tools are of paramount importance (Souza et al. 2008). 

Molecular markers have been used to assist different steps of common 

bean breeding programs aimed at developing cultivars resistant to rust. 



 

 44

Isozymes and DNA-based markers have been used to study the genetic 

diversity of the rust fungus (Lu and Groth 1988; Linde et al. 1990a, 1990b; 

McCain et al. 1992; Groth et al. 1995; Maclean et al. 1995; Faleiro et al. 

1998) and also for mapping and characterizing resistance genes to U. 

appendiculatus and to other important bean pathogens (Freyre et al. 1998; 

Miklas et al. 2002; Kelly et al. 2003; Miklas et al. 2006; Souza et al. 2008). 

In this review we describe and discuss important aspects about the bean 

rust. In addition, we present common bean breeding initiatives aiming at the 

development of rust resistant cultivars in Brazil. We have focused mainly the 

routine of the BIOAGRO/UFV Common Bean Breeding Program, which is 

assisted by molecular marker. This program is the main bean breeding 

program aiming rust resistance conducted in Brazil. Its objectives include the 

genetic study of host-pathogen interaction, identification and validation of 

molecular markers linked to RR genes, and the effective use of these markers 

for the development of cultivars with durable resistance to rust. 

 

2.  Characterization and Maintenance of the Pathogen 

 

2.1.  Differential cultivars for U. appendiculatus 

During the “Bean Rust Workshop” (BRW), held in 1983, 35 researchers from 

different countries proposed a series of 20 cultivars as the international 

differential standard for U. appendiculatus (Stavely et al. 1983) (Table 1). In 

1984, cv. ‘Mountainer White Half Runner’ was eliminated from this series due 

to its similarity with ‘Kentucky Wonder 780’ (Stavely 1984a). 

Characterization of Brazilian isolates based on those 19 differential cultivars 

was accomplished by Mora-Nuñes et al. (1992), Santos and Rios (2000) and 

Souza et al. (2005a). In their work, Mora-Nuñes et al. (1992) concluded that 

eight out of the 19 cultivars – ‘Kentucky  Wonder 814’, ‘Early Gallatin’, 

‘51051’, ‘NEP 2’, ‘Ecuador 299’, ‘Olathe’, ‘Mexico 309’ and ‘Redlands 

Pioneer’ – were sufficient to discriminate and classify isolates collected in 



 

 45

Brazil. Using these eight cultivars, Faleiro et al. (1999a) characterized 13 

races of this fungus in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais.

10.  Redlands Pioneer 20.  CNC 
aDeleted of the list because of its similarity to ‘Kentucky Wonder 780’ (Stavely 1984a). 
 

 

 In the 3rd BRW held in 2002, a new differential series was proposed for 

characterization of U. appendiculatus isolates (Steadman et al. 2002). This 

series contains six Andean and six Mesoamerican bean cultivars (Table 2). 

Cultivars ‘Early Gallatin’, ‘Redlands Pioneer’, ‘Golden Gate Wax’, ‘Aurora’, 

‘Mexico 309’, ‘Mexico 235’ and ‘CNC’, which were proposed in the 1983 

BRW, were maintained in the present differential series. Cultivars 

‘Montcalm’, ‘PC-50’, ‘PI 260418’, ‘Great Northern 1140’ and ‘PI 181996’ 

were added to the series. The wide adoption of this system can contribute to 

the elaboration of an internationally standardized classification methodology, 

and facilitate the exchange of information, and the cooperative use of the 

results obtained by different research groups throughout the world. 

 

2.2.  Obtaining of single-pustule isolates  

Obtaining single-pustule isolates from U. appendiculatus primary inoculum is 

an important initial step before the characterization and use of the pathogen in 

rust resistance tests. Single-pustule isolates are pure lines of the pathogen; 



 

 46

specific genotypes of the fungus. They are essential in the study of host-

pathogen interaction, host resistance and pathogen specialization.

 U. appendiculatus single-pustule isolates can be obtained from 

inoculum previously collected and maintained in fungal collections. But most 

often they are isolated from fungal spores collected from plant tissues infected 

under natural conditions in bean growing areas or experimental stations. For 

single-pustule isolation, a lower than usual inoculum concentration is used for 

inoculation in order to increase the chance of getting individual pustules. The 

spores collected in these single-pustules are multiplied in susceptible varieties 

for three or more consecutive cycles, using the regular inoculum 

concentration. After this procedure, the uredospores are collected and stored 

under controlled conditions (Souza et al. 2007a). 

 

2.3.  Physiological races 

Classification of U. appendiculatus into physiological races and the 

consequent knowledge of its virulence diversity is a basic step towards 



 

 47

understanding the dynamics of the pathogen distribution and the development 

of resistant cultivars. In this step it is also possible to identify which pathogen 

isolates can be used to monitor the introgression of resistance genes in 

breeding programs (Pastor-Corrales 2001; Pastor-Corrales and Stavely 2002; 

Souza et al. 2007a). 

 Steadman et al. (2002) proposed a binary nomenclature system for 

designation of the races in which the evaluation scale was divided in only two 

reaction degrees: resistant and susceptible. Each race is designated by two 

numbers separated by a hyphen. The first number is obtained by the sum of 

the binary values attributed to the susceptible Andean cultivars of the 

differential series. The second number is obtained by the sum of the binary 

values of the susceptible Mesoamerican cultivars (see Table 2). 

 Characterization of U. appendiculatus isolates collected in the USA, 

South Africa, Honduras, Argentina and Mozambique has been accomplished 

based on the procedure proposed in the 3rd BRW (Steadman et al. 2002; 

Acevedo et al. 2004; Jochua et al. 2004). Souza et al. (2007a) reported the 

first work using the standard system for classification of U. appendiculatus 

physiological races in Brazil using U. appendiculatus single-pustule isolates 

obtained from the fungal collection of BIOAGRO/UFV. 

 

2.4.  Fungal collection 

Although U. appendiculatus does not grow in artificial culture as it is an 

obligate parasite, viable spores can be preserved under laboratory conditions. 

Dry uredospores in plastic or glass tubes have been successfully maintained 

under dark conditions at 5 ± 1°C and relative humidity &amp;lt;50% for about one 

year at BIOAGRO/UFV. Alternatively, uredospores of the fungus frozen at -

80°C or submersed in liquid nitrogen can be stored for a longer period of time 

(Souza et al. 2008). Periodical inoculation of the preserved spores on 

susceptible common bean varieties is highly recommended, in order to 

increase the inoculum virulence. 



 

 48

3.  Disease Screening 

 

3.1.  U. appendiculatus inoculation 

U. appendiculatus inoculation is often done when the primary leaves of the 

bean plants reach approximately 2/3 of their full development, about 10 days 

after sowing under greenhouse conditions (20 ± 5°C). The standard 

concentration of inoculum is 2.0 × 104 uredospores/mL of distilled water 

containing 0.05% Tween-20. The inoculum solution can be applied on both 

leaf surfaces with a brush or sprayed using a manual atomizer (e.g., atomizer 

De Vilbiss no 15) adapted to an electric compressor. After inoculation the 

plants are transferred to a mist chamber (20 ± 1°C and relative humidity &gt; 

95%) where they are kept for approximately 48 h under a 12-hour light 

regime. In order to avoid contamination, plants inoculated with different 

isolates are kept in separate compartments of the chamber. After this period 

the plants are transferred to a greenhouse (20 ± 5°C), where they are kept until 

symptom evaluation, about 14 days after inoculation (Carrijo et al. 1980; 

Souza et al. 2005a, 2007a). 

 The inoculation can also be conduced using common bean excised 

leaves, as reported by Souza et al. (2005c). In this alternative method, after 

inoculation, each leaf is placed in a Petri dish (90 × 15 mm) on a sterile filter 

paper previously moistened with 3.0 mL distilled water. The dishes are 

incubated in a BOD at 20°C, under a 12-hour light regime. Each filter paper is 

moistened again with 1.5 mL distilled water every three-days until disease 

symptom evaluation, about 10 days after inoculation. 

 Both inoculation methods are efficient for evaluating the reaction of the 

common bean to U. appendiculatus. The only differences observed on the 

results by the two methods is that the number of pustules is higher in the 

conventional method and disease symptoms appear earlier in the alternative 

method (Souza et al. 2005c). It is suggested that the conventional inoculation 

method is more appropriate for spore multiplication and the excised leaf 

method can be used in the cases where the same plant needs to be assayed 



 

 49

several times. Another advantage of the alternative procedure refers to costs 

and safety; the whole method can be conducted in the laboratory without the 

need of exposing other plants to the pathogen. In addition, the tested plants are 

still able to grow and produce seeds. 

 

3.2.  Evaluation of rust symptoms 

The fungus U. appendiculatus may infect leaves, pods, and, rarely, stems and 

branches.  Symptoms usually appear first on the lower leaf surface as minute, 

whitish slightly raised spots about five or six days after inoculation. These 

spots enlarge to form mature reddish brown uredia which rupture the 

epidermis about two days later. Sporulation begins and the uredia may attain a 

diameter of 1-2 mm about 8-12 days after inoculation. In some cases, 

secondary and tertiary uredia develop around the perimeter of these primary 

uredia. The entire infection cycle occurs within approximately 10-15 days 

(Stavely and Pastor-Corrales 1989; Souza et al. 2008). 

 The reaction degrees to the disease are usually determined based on a 

scale of six infection degrees: 1- no pustules (immunity); 2 - necrotic spots 

without sporulation; 3 - pustules undergoing sporulation with a diameter of &amp;lt;

300 ?m; 4 - pustules undergoing sporulation with a diameter ranging from 300 

?m to 499 ?m; 5 - pustules undergoing sporulation with a diameter ranging 

from 500 ?m to 800 ?m; and 6 - pustules undergoing sporulation with a 

diameter of &gt; 800 ?m (Stavely et al. 1983). 

 The infection degrees are determined approximately about 10-15 days 

after inoculation when up to 50 % of the pustules are sporulating. The lesions 

in both surfaces of the primary leaves should be determined visually by at 

least two evaluators. The cultivars that predominantly presented degrees 3 or 

lower were classified as resistant, whereas those with predominant degrees 4 

or higher are considered to be susceptible. 



 

 50

4.  Pathosystem U. appendiculatus–P. vulgaris 

 

4.1.  Host-pathogen coevolution 

Alloenzymes studies, variation patterns of the common bean seed protein 

phaseolin, and morphological evidences revealed the existence of a 

Mesoamerican and an Andean gene pool in common bean (Gepts et al. 1986; 

Singh et al. 1991a, 1991b). The Andean cultivars originated in the Andean 

region of South America, while the Mesoamerican beans were domesticated 

from wild populations in Mexico and Central America. 

 Using phenotypic (virulence diversity) and genotypic (RAPD markers) 

analyses of 90 U. appendiculatus isolates from thirteen Latin American 

countries, Araya et al. (2004) were able to divide them into two major groups, 

namely the Andean and the Mesoamerican, and one intermediate group.  In 

general, Andean and Mesoamerican isolates showed virulence specificity to 

landraces belonging to their respective gene pools, however, the Andean 

isolates tended to display greater geographic specificity than the 

Mesoamerican isolates. This phenomenon, previously observed by Sandlin et 

al. (1999), suggests a parallel evolution in the bean rust pathosystem. The 

intermediate virulence group of U. appendiculatus races, observed by 

Braithwaite et al. (1994), Maclean et al. (1995), Sandlin et al. (1999), and 

Araya et al. (2004), provide evidence of a transition area between these two 

gene pools in both the common bean host and the rust pathogen. It is therefore 

possible that ongoing adaptation between pathogen and host will eventually 

include isolates from the intermediate group into the other two major groups 

(Araya et al. 2004). 

 The virulence pattern analysis of 41 U. appendiculatus isolates from 

Brazil, demonstrated they were compatible with both Mesoamerican and 

Andean common bean cultivars (Souza et al. 2005a) suggesting that these 

isolates belong to the intermediate virulence group.       



 

 51

4.2.  Genetics of the rust resistance in common bean 

Resistance to bean rust can be controlled by major single dominant genes 

(Augustin et al. 1972; Ballantyne 1978; Christ and Groth 1982a; Sayler et al. 

1995; Corrêa et al. 2000; Faleiro et al. 2000a, 2000b; Alzate-Marin et al. 

2004; Souza et al. 2007b, 2007c), single recessive gene (Zaiter et al. 1989), 

two genes (Finke et al. 1986), two complementary dominant genes (Grafton et 

al. 1985), or by genes with minor effect (Edington et al. 1994). The gene-to-

gene relationship proposed by Flor (1971) has been shown to occur in the U. 

appendiculatus–P. vulgaris interaction (Christ and Groth 1982a, 1982b). 

Resistance genes effective against multiple races of the pathogen are 

organized in clusters or complex loci (Stavely 1984b; Stavely and Grafton 

1985).  To date at least 13 dominant RR genes have been identified (genes Ur-

1 to Ur-13), which are described in Table 3. These genes are named according 

to a nomenclature proposed by Kelly et al. (1996). In addition to these 13 

genes, other important unnamed RR genes, in ‘BAC6’ (Jung et al. 1996), 

‘Ouro Negro’ (Corrêa et al. 2000; Faleiro et al. 2000a), ‘Dorado’ (Miklas et 

al. 2000, 2002), and ‘PI 260418’ (Pastor-Corrales 2005; Pastor-Corrales et al. 

2008) have been identified.  The proper characterization of the RR genes from 

Mesoamerican and Andean gene pools is essential for the future of the 

common bean breeding aiming rust resistance. It will broaden the spectra of 

the RR genes presently used (Liebenberg et al. 2006; Pastor-Corrales et al. 

2008). 

 

5.  Gene Tagging 

 

Several RAPD markers associated with genes conferring resistance to rust in 

common bean have been identified, as described in Table 3. Many SCAR 

markers have been developed to increase the reproducibility of the RAPD 

markers (Table 3). These molecular markers have been used for mapping Ur 

genes in the integrated common bean map (Freyre et al. 1998; Miklas et al. 

2002; Kelly et al. 2003; Miklas et al. 2006).

 The groups of Mesoamerican genes Ur-5/Ur-Dorado53/Ur-ON and Ur-

3/Ur-7/Ur-11/Ur-Dorado108/Ur-BAC6 have been mapped in linkage groups 

(LG) B4 and B11, respectively. Ur-3 and Ur-11, and also Ur-Dorado108 map 

to the end of LG B11, next to the Co-2 locus, which is related to resistance to 

anthracnose. Ur-BAC6 is located near to the Ur-7 locus, and they do not 

appear to be close to Ur-Dorado108, Ur-3, and Ur-11. The Andean genes Ur-

4, Ur-6, Ur-9, Ur-12, and Ur-13 were mapped to LG B6, B11, B1, B7, and 

B8, respectively (Miklas et al. 2002; Kelly et al. 2003; Miklas et al. 2006; 

Wright et al. 2008). Park et al. (2008) observed a possible allelic relationship 

between Ur-7 present in Mesoamerican cultivar ‘Great Northern 1140’ and 

Ur-6 present in Andean cultivar ‘Olathe’, based on the fact that the band 

generated by SCAR AD12 linked to Ur-7 was also present in cultivar 

‘Olathe’. 

 Clustering is also observed between RR genes and those conferring 

resistance to anthracnose (Co) and BCMV (Miklas et al. 2006). For instance, 

the Andean RR gene Ur-9 and the anthracnose resistance gene Co-1 co-

localize on LG B1 (Kelly and Vallejo 2004; Miklas et al. 2006). The 

Mesoamerican genes Ur-5 and Co-3/Co-9, and gene Ur-ON from cultivar 

‘Ouro Negro’ and Co-10 co-localize on LG B4 (Faleiro et al. 2000b; Alzate-

Marin et al. 2003), and Ur-3 co-localize with Co-2 on LG B11, suggesting that 

these genes derived from common ancestral gene sequences (Geffroy et al. 

1999; Faleiro et al. 2000b, 2003; Miklas et al. 2006). Recent works show that 

SCAR SQ4 linked to the Co-2 anthracnose resistance gene is closely linked to 

Ur-11 (Awale et al. 2008). 

 The linkage groups designated as B1-to-B11 in the BJ common bean 

core map correspond to the chromosomes 1-to-11, respectively (Pedrosa et al. 

2003, 2006, 2008).

6.  Gene Pyramiding Aiming at Development of Common Bean Lines 

Resistant to Rust 

 

The use of resistant cultivars is certainly the main component of the integrated 

bean rust management. Pyramiding of resistance genes from both Andean and 

Mesoamerican gene pools is an important strategy for developing 

complementary and durable resistance to a large number of U. appendiculatus 

races (Stavely and Pastor-Corrales 1989; Pastor-Corrales and Stavely 2002; 

Araya et al. 2004). The large number of virulence patterns of U. 

appendiculatus, some of which are unique to certain countries, requires the 

use of specific resistance genes in different regions (Ballantyne 1978; Araya et 

al. 2004; Souza et al. 2005a; Liebenberg et al. 2006; Acevedo et al. 2008; 

Alleyne et al. 2008). 

 Gene pyramiding using only conventional breeding methods has not 

been effective mainly due to the difficulties in selecting genotypes harboring 

different resistance genes which demand multiple or serial inoculations of the 

same plant or population (Michelmore 1995). This limitation affects the 

breeding process as a whole and also decreases the accuracy and efficiency of 

the selection process (Bigirimana and Höfte 2001; Souza et al. 2005d). 

Epistatic interactions between different resistance genes can also affect the 

selection process (Singh et al. 2001). 

 These limitations can be overcome by the use of molecular markers 

linked to the resistance genes. With the use of molecular markers not only the 

multiple and sequential inoculations can be avoided but also the confounding 

effect of potential epistatic interactions among the different resistance genes 

present in the same genetic background (Michelmore 1995; Bigirimana and 

Höfte 2001; Singh et al. 2001; Toenniessen et al. 2003). However, for each 

resistance allele a specific marker or markers need to be identified. The use of 

flanking markers tightly linked to the locus of interest makes selection even 

more robust (Faleiro et al. 2003). 



 

 57

 Molecular markers can also be used to accelerate the recovery of the 

recurrent parent’s genome in backcross breeding programs. Simulation studies 

and real data indicate that only three or four backcrosses are necessary to 

recover the recurrent parent’s genome when molecular markers are used 

(Openshaw et al. 1994; Faleiro et al. 2004; Ragagnin et al. 2009). Separate 

backcross programs assisted by molecular marker fingerprinting can be used 

for the individual introgression of resistance genes in commercial cultivars. 

This strategy can be the initial step for pyramiding of RR alleles. 

 Experimental evidence demonstrates that gene pyramiding confers 

more effective resistance to the host plant than that conferred by the sum of 

the resistance present in the progenitor plants (Yoshimura et al. 1995; Huang 

et al. 1997; Singh et al. 2001). According to Schafer and Roelfs (1985), the 

probability that a pathogen will overcome a gene pyramid of four to six genes 

is extremely low. In order for this to happen, independent mutations in the 

pathogen genome must occur and they should be combined in the same 

genetic background, or they could occur simultaneously or sequentially in the 

genome of a specific pathogen isolate. Nelson (1979) argues that resistance 

resulting from the partial action of several resistance genes exerts a low 

selection pressure on the pathogen and for this reason it tends to last for a long 

period of time. Although this concept is not fully accepted by the scientific 

community there are experimental data supporting the existence of partial 

effects of different resistance genes in some pathosystems (Brondy et al. 1986; 

Pedersen and Leath 1988). According to the theory presented the duration of 

resistance will depend on the number of genes to be overcome by the 

pathogen. 

 Epidemiology data also support the use of gene pyramiding as an 

effective strategy for disease control. According to Thrall and Burdon (2003), 

there is an inverse correlation between pathogen fitness, as measured by the 

number of spores produced, and the number of avirulence genes present in its 

genome. The authors observed that the pathogen populations which were able 

to infect a greater number of host populations were less aggressive than 



 

 58

pathogen populations which were able to infect a lower number of host 

populations. This indicates that the inactivation of several avirulence genes in 

the pathogen compromises its adaptability. This is a positive aspect from the 

epidemiological perspective because it indicates that gene pyramiding can 

potentially keep the disease below an economical damage level and also 

prevent its fast dissemination. 

 The main steps of a gene pyramiding breeding program assisted by 

molecular markers aiming at disease resistance are: (i) identification of the 

most prevalent and virulent races of the pathogen in the region of interest and 

characterization of the most promising resistance sources for that region; (ii) 

determination of the disease resistance inheritance mode by crossing the 

resistance sources and the susceptible cultivar; (iii) identification of molecular 

markers tightly linked to the various disease resistance alleles; (iv) 

development of lines harboring the R genes and the molecular markers of 

interest; this process is often done by backcrossing; (v) identification of 

markers that can specifically identify the resistance alleles to avoid false 

positives; and (vi) pyramiding of resistance alleles by intercrossing the lines 

obtained. During this process, the following activities must also be considered: 

(i) continuous characterization of the variability of the pathogen and the host; 

(ii) characterization and introduction of new resistance sources in the breeding 

program; and (iii) identification of molecular markers linked to the resistance 

genes present in the new resistance sources (Alzate-Marin et al. 2005; Souza 

et al. 2008). 

 In the BIOAGRO-UFV Common Bean Breeding Program, molecular 

fingerprinting based on the RAPD-PCR technique has been used to accelerate 

the development of common bean lines resistant to rust, anthracnose and 

angular leaf spot. Molecular marker-assisted selection has been also used to 

combine the different resistance genes in a single genetic background (Faleiro 

et al. 2004; Ragagnin et al. 2009). 

 In the specific case of rust, the breeding program conduced at 

BIOAGRO/UFV is also using the MAS (molecular-assisted selection) for 



 

 59

developing lines with specific RR genes (Ur-ON, Ur-5, and Ur-11) aiming at 

their introgression and pyramiding in Brazilian commercial cultivars (Alzate-

Marin et al. 2004; Faleiro et al. 2004; Souza et al. 2005d, 2007b; Ragagnin et 

al. 2009). Initially, the gene Ur-ON has been used as the only source for 

resistance to U. appendiculatus in that breeding program. The RAPD marker 

OPX11 (Faleiro et al. 2000a) and the SCAR markers SF10 and SBA08 have 

been used for the indirect selection of Ur-ON and  its introgression in the 

genetic background ‘Rudá’ (Corrêa et al. 2000). Later on, another RR gene 

was characterized, the gene Ur-11, which was then also introgressed into 

‘Rudá’ (Souza et al. 2002). To assist the selection of Ur-11, the RAPD marker 

OPAE19 was validated in a F2 population derived from the cross ‘Rudá’ × 

‘Belmidak RR-3’ (Alzate-Marin et al. 2004). Then, this marker was converted 

into a SCAR marker (SCAR AE19) by Queiroz et al. (2004). In the study of 

Souza et al. (2007b) the SCAR marker SI19 was validated as linked to gene 

Ur-5 from cultivar ‘Mexico 309’. It was also verified that this marker can be 

used for the indirect selection of gene Ur-5 in the presence of genes Ur-ON 

and Ur-11. 

 Using separate backcross programs and gene pyramiding approaches 

assisted by molecular markers, the BIOAGRO/UFV Common Bean Breeding 

Program was able to create advanced carioca-type common bean lines with 

wide and potentially durable resistance to U. appendiculatus. These lines show 

the same resistance spectra present in the donor parents and no yield penalty in 

relation to the commercial cultivars used as recurrent parents (Souza et al. 

2005b, 2009). 

 The yield components of the common bean lines developed by the 

BIOAGRO/UFV are evaluated in at least two distinct growing seasons. The 

evaluation assays include resistant control lines and high yielding reference 

cultivars widely planted in Brazil. Randomized complete block or lattice 

designs with three repetitions (plots) are used. Each plot consists of two rows 

each 2.0 m long, spaced by 0.5 m, with about 15 seeds per meter. Fertilizer 

application is done according to the recommendations for dry bean cultivation 



 

 60

in the State of Minas Gerais. Harvest of the whole plot is done manually. The 

yield components usually evaluated are: grain yield, determined for each plot 

and expressed as g/plot or Kg/ha; plant height, the mean height (in 

centimeters) of the plants at stage R8 in each plot; mean number of seeds per 

pod in each plot; mean number of pods per plant in each plot (Ragagnin et al. 

2009). 

 The lines selected based on molecular markers and yield components 

are also tested against the pathogen under greenhouse (specific races) and field 

(natural incidence) conditions. The lines with resistance spectra similar to 

those of the donor parents and as productive as the recurrent parents and 

control cultivars are evaluated in different regions by the Brazilian Bean 

Assay Network. If the superior agronomic performance of these lines is 

confirmed they are recommended as new cultivars. In addition, the resistance 

gene pyramid can be transferred to other Brazilian commercial cultivars. 

 

7.  Perspectives 

 

Yield and disease resistance are the main foci of common bean breeders 

throughout the world. The large number of pathogens affecting this crop is one 

of the main causes of the low yield observed in many bean growing regions. 

 The concept of gene pyramiding assisted by molecular markers has 

been successfully used by the BIOAGRO/UFV Common Bean Breeding 

Program to create lines with wide and potentially durable resistance. Separate 

backcross programs assisted by molecular markers have allowed the 

individual introgression of resistance genes in recurrent cultivars after only 

three or four backcross cycles. The lines obtained have shown the same 

resistance spectra present in the donor parents. Evaluation of yield 

components of the advanced lines have demonstrated that no yield penalty in 

relation to recurrent cultivars was observed after the pyramiding process 

(Faleiro et al. 2004; Ragagnin et al. 2009; Souza et al. 2005b, 2009). 



 

 61

 To be effective, the gene pyramiding strategy must be a continuous 

effort. Permanent monitoring for the presence of new virulent races in the field 

and search for new resistance sources are inherent steps in this breeding 

strategy. 

 A significant variability of U. appendiculatus isolates has been 

observed in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais (Faleiro et al. 1998, 1999a; 

Souza et al. 2005a, 2007a). Isolates collected by these authors have been used 

to support the bean breeding programs of different research institutions in 

Brazil. As a result of this work, it was possible to select resistant cultivars, like 

‘Ouro Negro’ (Faleiro et al. 2000b; Vieira et al. 2005), and to develop other 

cultivars and advanced lines harboring rust resistance genes (Faleiro et al. 

2004; Ragagnin et al. 2009). Periodical collection, maintenance and 

classification of U. appendiculatus isolates are essential steps of the bean 

breeding program as these steps inform about the variability of the pathogen in 

a growing area over time. Thus new sources of resistance can be identified and 

validated with adequate monitoring and identification of the most frequent 

races of the pathogen (Souza et al. 2007a). 

 Frequent monitoring of prevalent races of pathogens presenting high 

variability is very helpful in studies involving genetic dynamics, as the 

geographical origin of the isolates may provide indirect evidences of their 

diversity, because of their adaptation to different environment conditions. 

 In this way, a consistent effort of monitoring and classification of U. 

appendiculatus isolates has been established in Minas Gerais, Brazil, to attend 

the breeding programs of the “Minas Gerais Common Bean Covenant”. This 

agreement includes four instituitions: Universidade Federal de Viçosa (UFV), 

Universidade Federal de Lavras (UFLA), Empresa de Pesquisa Agropecuária 

de Minas Gerais (EPAMIG), and Embrapa Arroz e Feijão. This effort also 

includes analyses of the geographical variability of U. appendiculatus in 

association with molecular markers.

Characterization of the Rust Resistance Gene Present in the 

Common Bean Cultivar ‘Ouro Negro’, the Main Rust 

Resistance Source Used in Brazil 
 

 

Abstract:  Identification and characterization of new resistance sources are 

basic steps for plant breeding programs aiming to develop modern cultivars 

with effective resistance to pathogens.  The Mesoamerican black seeded 

common bean cultivar ‘Ouro Negro’ is the main rust resistance (RR) source 

used in Brazil.  It is resistant to U. appendiculatus isolates from different bean 

growing areas of the country.  However, the RR gene present in ‘Ouro Negro’, 

temporally named as Ur-ON, has not been fully characterized yet.  The main 

goal of the present work was to characterize the gene Ur-ON.  We have 

compared the RR spectrum presented by ‘Ouro Negro’ with those of other 

bean lines harboring known RR genes when inoculated with nine selected 

races of U. appendiculatus.  In addition, all bean lines were screened with 

molecular markers linked to Ur-ON aiming to identify additional evidence for 

the presence of alleles for this locus in the screened RR sources.  Finally, we 

tested the allelic relationships of Ur-ON with already characterized RR genes 

from lines resistant to at least one race of the pathogen.  We also accomplished 

allelism tests between ‘Ouro Negro’ and ‘CNC’ and ‘CSW 643’, important 

RR sources in Brazil harboring unnamed RR genes.  The results showed that 

the major dominant gene conditioning RR in ‘Ouro Negro’ is positioned at a 

locus distinct from those with which it was compared.  We propose that this 

gene – or complex gene locus – is unique and be designated Ur-14. 

 

Key words:  Allelism test – molecular markers – resistance genes – Uromyces 

appendiculatus – Phaseolus vulgaris

1.  Introduction 

 

Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is the main source of vegetable protein, 

minerals, and vitamins for a large fraction of the Brazilians. The economical, 

nutritional, and social value of the bean crop to millions of people in many 

other countries of Latin America, and Eastern and Southern Africa is 

unquestionable (Wortmann et al. 1998; Broughton et al. 2003). 

 Rust is a bean fungal disease incited by Uromyces appendiculatus F. 

Strauss (sin. U. phaseoli G. Winter). Although this fungus is distributed 

worldwide, it effectively causes major production problems in humid tropical 

and subtropical areas and periodic severe epidemics in humid temperate 

regions (Souza et al. 2008).  Severe bean rust epidemics have been reported in 

Latin America, Australia, China, the United States, and some areas of Europe 

(Stavely and Pastor-Corrales 1989).  The major losses in Brazil occur in south, 

southeast and central areas, including the states of Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul, 

Santa Catarina, Minas Gerais, São Paulo, and Goiás (Souza et al. 2005a).  

Recommended disease management practices for bean rust control include 

crop rotation, planting within recommended dates, growing resistant cultivars, 

and timely spraying of fungicides (Mmbaga et al. 1996).  Chemical products 

are hardly used due to the need of specific technical knowledge and also 

because they increase the production costs.  Besides, chemical products are 

often an ecotoxicological concern.  The use of resistant cultivars is an 

efficient, safe, and inexpensive alternative accessible to bean growers for the 

effective rust control. 

 Thirteen dominant rust resistance (RR) genes were identified to date 

(Ur-1–to–Ur-13). These genes are named according to the nomenclature 

proposed by Kelly et al. (1996).  In addition to them, other important unnamed 

genes have been identified, such as those present in the common bean lines 

‘BAC6’, ‘CNC’, ‘CSW 643’, ‘Dorado’, ‘Ouro Negro’, and ‘PI 260418’ 

(reviewed in Souza et al. 2008).  The appropriate characterization of RR genes 

from different origins (Mesoamerican and Andean) is essential for the future

it should broaden the spectra of the genes currently used (Liebenberg et al. 

2006).  Besides, new sources of resistance must always be identified and 

characterized because of the high virulence diversity and variability present in 

the pathogen population (Araya et al. 2004; Liebenberg et al. 2006; Souza et 

al. 2007).  The Mesoamerican cultivar ‘Ouro Negro’ was developed by CIAT 

(Cali, Colombia) and initially named ‘Honduras 35’, in 1991 this bean line 

was introduced in Brazil as cultivar ‘Ouro Negro’ (Araújo et al. 1991). This 

black seeded common bean line showed resistance to several isolates of U. 

appendiculatus in Brazil (Faleiro et al. 1999, 2000a; Souza et al. 2007) and in 

the USA (Alzate-Marin et al. 2004).  In addition, it is resistant to races 73, 81, 

and 89 of Colletotrichum lindemuthianum (Sacc. &amp;amp; Magnus) Lams.-Scrib., the 

causal agent of bean anthracnose (Alzate-Marin et al. 2003), and resistant to 

races 63-63 and 63-23 of Pseudocercospora griseola (Sacc.) Crous &amp;amp; U. 

Braun, the causal agent of angular leaf spot (Sanglard et al. 2009). 

 Previous works conducted by our research group showed that ‘Ouro 

Negro’ possesses single resistance genes to rust and anthracnose located 12.3 

cM apart on the same linkage group (Faleiro et al. 2000b).  The independence 

of the anthracnose resistance gene in ‘Ouro Negro’ has been proven and it was 

designated Co-10 (Alzate-Marin et al. 2003).  Information is lacking on the 

independence of the RR gene in this cultivar, which has been temporary 

named as Ur-OuroNegro or Ur-ON.  It is the principal RR gene used in Brazil 

for breeding purposes (Faleiro et al. 2004; Souza et al. 2008; Ragagnin et al. 

2009). 

 The main goal of the present work was to characterize the 

Mesoamerican RR gene Ur-ON.  We have done a comparative analysis of the 

resistance spectra presented by ‘Ouro Negro’ and by bean lines harboring 

known RR genes which were inoculated with selected Brazilian races of U. 

appendiculatus.  These races are used by our breeding program at the 

Universidade Federal de Viçosa - UFV, Minas Gerais, Brazil, to select 

genotypes resistant to the pathogen.  In addition, all RR sources have been 



 

 77

screened with molecular markers reported as linked to Ur-ON aiming to 

identify additional evidence for the presence/absence of resistance alleles for 

this locus in the tested bean lines.  Finally, when possible, we also studied the 

allelic relationships of Ur-ON with already characterized RR genes and with 

the unnamed genes present in ‘CNC’ and ‘CSW 643’, important RR sources to 

be explored in Brazil (Souza et al. 2005a). 

 

2.  Materials and Methods 

 

2.1.  Genetic material and crosses 

Seeds from cultivars ‘Ouro Negro’, ‘US Pinto 111’ (susceptible control), ‘AxS 

37’, ‘CNC’, ‘CSW 643’, and the RR sources listed in Table 1 were provided 

by the Active Germplasm Bank of the BIOAGRO/UFV (Viçosa, MG, Brazil). 

The crosses were performed in the greenhouse.  F1 seeds were sowed 

and the corresponding F1 plants generated the F2 and F3 generations.  ‘Ouro 

Negro’ was used as the male parent, except in the cross with ‘PI181996’.  To 

identify the true hybrids, all F1 plants were analyzed morphologically (flower 

color).  The F1 plants derived from the crosses between ‘Ouro Negro’ and 

other black seeded cultivars (‘PI181996’, ‘Mexico 309’, and ‘CNC’) were also 

analyzed with RAPD markers according to Alzate-Marin et al. (1996).  The 

presence in a F1 plant of a PCR product which was present only in the male 

parent confirmed that this F1 plant was indeed a hybrid. 

 

2.2.  U. appendiculatus races and inoculation  

The selected Brazilian U. appendiculatus mono-pustule isolates used in this 

work were characterized and classified into physiological races by Souza et al. 

(2007).  They are maintained in the fungal collection of the BIOAGRO/UFV 

Common Bean Breeding Program.  To increase and keep the viability of the 

inoculum, the spores of the pathogen stored under low humidity at 4°C and 

protected from light were first inoculated on leaves of the susceptible cultivar 

‘US Pinto 111’.  Newly generated spores were used in the inoculation assays.

Inoculation was carried out when the primary leaves of the bean plants 

reached approximately 2/3 of their full development, about 10 days after 

sowing under greenhouse conditions (20 ± 5°C), as described by Souza et al. 

(2007).  In addition to the F2 and F3 plants used for allelism tests, about ten 

plants from each RR source and control cultivar were inoculated with the 

pathogen for the comparative analysis of their resistance spectra.  The 

inoculum concentration was 2.0 × 104 uredospores/mL distilled water 

containing Tween-20 (0.05%, v:v).  The inoculum solution was sprayed on 

both leaf surfaces using a manual atomizer (De Vilbiss no 15) adapted to an 

electric compressor.  After inoculation the plants were transferred to a mist 

chamber (20 ± 1°C and relative humidity &gt; 95%) where they were kept for 

approximately 48 h under a 12-hour light regime.  In order to avoid 

contamination, plants inoculated with different isolates were kept in separate 

compartments of the mist chamber.  After this period the plants were 

transferred to a greenhouse (20 ± 5°C), where they were kept until symptom 

evaluation, about 15 days after the inoculation. 

 

2.3.  Disease evaluation 

Rust symptoms were determined approximately 15 days after inoculation, 

when about 50 % of the pustules had sporulated.  The disease evaluation was 

carried out based on a six-degree scale proposed by Stavely et al. (1983): 1- no 

pustules (immunity); 2 - necrotic spots without sporulation; 3 - pustules 

undergoing sporulation with a diameter of &amp;lt;300 ?m; 4 - pustules undergoing 

sporulation with a diameter ranging from 300 ?m to 499 ?m; 5 - pustules 

undergoing sporulation with a diameter ranging from 500 ?m to 800 ?m; and 

6 - pustules undergoing sporulation with a diameter of &gt; 800 ?m. 

The lesions on both surfaces of the inoculated leaves were evaluated 

visually by at least two researchers.  The common bean cultivars or individual 

plants from the segregating populations that predominantly presented degree 3 

or lower were classified as resistant, whereas those with predominant degree 4 

or higher were considered susceptible. 



 

 81

2.4.  DNA marker analyses 

Information about the SCAR and RAPD markers linked to the gene Ur-ON 

used in the molecular screening of RR sources is depicted in Table 2.  Fresh 

leaves that had been detached from the plants before pathogen inoculation 

were used for DNA extraction according to Doyle and Doyle (1990).  DNA 

amplification by the RAPD technique was according to Faleiro et al. (2000a).  

Amplification reactions using SCAR markers were as described by Côrrea et 

al. (2000).  The amplified products were visualized under UV light after 

electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide (0.2 

?g/mL), immersed in a 1X sodium boric acid (SB) buffer (10 mM sodium 

hydroxide, pH adjusted to 8.5 with boric acid).   

 

2.5.  Chi-square analyses 

The phenotypic frequencies (proportion of resistant and susceptible plants) 

observed in the segregating population used for allelism studies were tested 

for goodness-of-fit to theoretical ratios by the Chi-square (?2) test.

3.  Results 

 

3.1.  Reaction of RR sources to selected races of U. appendiculatus 

Out of the 17 RR sources tested against the pathogen (Table 3), seven were 

susceptible to all nine selected races of U. appendiculatus, so was the control 

cultivar ‘US Pinto 111’.  Among the RR sources there are the common bean 

lines harboring the Andean genes Ur-4 (‘Early Gallatin’), Ur-6 (‘Golden Gate 

Wax’), Ur-6+ (‘Pinto Olathe’; Andean gene in a Mesoamerican background, 

see Table 1), Ur-8 (‘U.S. #3’), and Ur-10 (‘Resisto’), and the Mesoamerican 

genes Ur-3 (‘Aurora’) and Ur-7 (‘GN 1140’).  The resistance spectra 

presented by these lines indicate that Ur-ON is independent from the genes 

Ur-3, Ur-4, Ur-6, Ur-6+, Ur-7, Ur-8, and Ur-10.  The other sources were 

resistant to at least one race of the pathogen (Table 3).  For this reason they 

were crossed with ‘Ouro Negro’ aiming to study the allelic relationship 

between their RR genes and Ur-ON.  Like ‘Ouro Negro’, the Mesoamerican 

cultivars ‘AxS 37’ (Ur-22), ‘PI181996’ (Ur-11), and ‘CSW 643’ (Ur-?), and 

the Andean cultivar ‘Brown Beauty’ (Ur-4), were resistant to all tested U. 

appendiculatus races (Table 3).  These results suggest that allelism tests 

between these cultivars and ‘Ouro Negro’ are greatly needed.       

 

3.2.  Molecular screening with DNA markers linked to the RR gene 

present in ‘Ouro Negro’  

Control cultivar ‘US Pinto 111’, as well as cultivars ‘Aurora’ (Ur-3), ‘Ecuador 

299’ (Ur-3+), ‘Early Gallatin’ (Ur-4), ‘Brown Beauty’ (Ur-4), ‘Pinto Olathe’ 

(Ur-6+), ‘GN 1140’ (Ur-7), ‘Resisto’ (Ur-10), ‘PI181996’ (Ur-11), and 

‘Redlands Pioneer’ (Ur-13) did not present the DNA markers linked to Ur-ON 

(Table 3).  These results suggest that the RR gene present in ‘Ouro Negro’ 

does not have allelic relationship with genes Ur-3, Ur-3+, Ur-4, Ur-6, Ur-7, 

Ur-10, Ur-11, and Ur-13.

Among all cultivars tested, only ‘Ouro Negro’ presented the marker 

OPX11 (Table 3), indicating that this is a specific marker for the gene Ur-ON.  

As shown in Table 3, marker SBA08 was present in only four of the 17 

screened RR sources; the Mesoamerican cultivars ‘AxS 37’, ‘Mexico 235’, 

‘Mexico 309’, and ‘CSW 643’.  Marker SF10 was present in six cultivars: 

‘AxS 37’, ‘Mexico 309’, ‘Golden Gate Wax’, ‘U.S. #3’, ‘PC-50’, and ‘CNC’.  

Only ‘AxS 37’ and ‘Mexico 309’ presented both SBA08 and SF10 markers. 

 

3.3.  Allelism tests 

In the allelism tests with the F2 populations derived from crosses between 

‘Ouro Negro’ and ‘Ecuador 299’ (Ur-3+), ‘Mexico 235’ (Ur-3+), ‘Brown 

Beauty’ (Ur-4), ‘Mexico 309’ (Ur-5), ‘BelMiDak RR-3’ (Ur-11), ‘PI181996’ 

(Ur-11), and ‘CSW 643’ (Ur-?), the segregation ratios of RR were of 15 

resistant to 1 susceptible plant (15R:1S) (Table 4).  These results show that 

two independent dominant genes governed RR in each population and that the 

resistance gene present in ‘Ouro Negro’ segregated independently of the 

resistance loci Ur-3+, Ur-4, Ur-5, Ur-11, and the unnamed locus (Ur-?) of 

‘CSW 643’. 

 The segregation ratio of RR in the F3 population derived from the cross 

between ‘Ouro Negro’ and ‘Redlands Pioneer’ (Ur-13) was 55R:9S (Table 4), 

indicating that two independent dominant genes governed resistance in this 

population. 

 In the F2 population derived from the cross between ‘Ouro Negro’ and 

‘CNC’ the segregation ratio was 63R:1S (Table 4), indicating that three 

independent dominant genes conditioned resistance in this cross.  In the F2 

population derived from the crosses between ‘Ouro Negro’ and ‘AxS 37’ (Ur-

22), and ‘Ouro Negro’ and ‘PC-50’ (Ur-9), the segregation ratios were 57R:7S 

(Table 4), indicating that three independent dominant genes determined 

resistance in these crosses and two of the genes are complementary.  In this 

case Ur-ON could be one of the complementary genes.

4.  Discussion 

 

Inheritance studies previously developed by our research group and additional 

data reported by the present work show that a major dominant gene – or 

complex gene locus – confers resistance to rust in ‘Ouro Negro’ (Table 4).  

The temporary symbol Ur-ON was assigned to this gene because it had not 

been fully characterized.  Allelism studies reported by Alzate-Marin et al. 

(2004) showed that Ur-ON does not correspond to genes Ur-5 (‘Mexico 309’) 

or Ur-11 (‘BelMiDak RR-3’) (Table 4).  Ur-ON is also different from the 

Mesoamerican dominant genes Ur-1 (‘B1627’) and Ur-2 (‘B2090’) identified 

by Ballantyne (1978).  These are obsolete RR genes supplanted by the 

majority of the U. appendiculatus races.  Seed stocks for the lines ‘B1627’ and 

‘B2090’ that harbor these genes no longer exist.  In addition, Ur-ON does not 

correspond to the gene Ur-12 (‘PC-50’) that conditions adult plant resistance 

expressed at the fourth bean trifoliate stage (Jung et al. 1998), since Ur-ON 

confers seedling rust resistance (Corrêa et al. 2000; Faleiro et al. 2000a, 2003). 

 In the present work we further characterized Ur-ON in relation to other 

RR genes previously identified (Ur-22, Ur-3, Ur-3+, Ur-4, Ur-5, Ur-6, Ur-6+, 

Ur-7, Ur-8, Ur-9, Ur-10, Ur-11, and Ur-13; see Table 1) and the genes present 

in the bean lines ‘CNC’ and ‘CSW 643’, important RR sources to be explored 

in Brazil (Souza et al. 2005a).  We did a comparative analysis of the resistance 

spectra presented by ‘Ouro Negro’ and by other 17 RR sources when 

inoculated with nine selected Brazilian races of U. appendiculatus.  These 

races are currently used by our common bean breeding program to select 

resistant bean lines.  The resistance spectra analysis indicated that Ur-ON is 

independent from the genes Ur-3, Ur-4, Ur-6, Ur-6+, Ur-7, Ur-8, and Ur-10 

because unlike Ur-ON these genes did not confer resistance to any of the 

tested U. appendiculatus races (Table 3). 

 In addition, we also screened all RR sources with molecular markers 

reported as linked to Ur-ON (Table 2) aiming to identify additional evidence 

for the presence/absence of resistance alleles for the locus Ur-ON in the 



 

 88

screened bean lines.  The results suggested that Ur-ON does not have allelic 

relationship with the genes Ur-3, Ur-3+, Ur-4, Ur-6, Ur-7, Ur-10, Ur-11, and 

Ur-13 because the bean lines harboring these genes did not present any of the 

DNA markers (Table 3).  In this assay marker OPX11 showed to be specific 

for Ur-ON.  This marker can be used to select Ur-ON during its pyramiding 

with any of the RR genes listed in Table 3.  Previous attempts to convert 

OPX11 into a SCAR marker were unsuccessful (Côrrea et al. (2000)), but we 

are currently pursuing this objective.  SCAR markers have the advantage to be 

highly reproducible and can be used in a multiplex PCR analysis since they 

identify specific loci. 

 Finally, we also studied the allelic relationship of Ur-ON with some of 

the already characterized RR genes and with the unnamed genes present in 

‘CNC’ and ‘CSW 643’.  The allelism tests demonstrated that ‘Ouro Negro’ 

carries one dominant gene segregating independently of Ur-3, Ur-3+, Ur-4, 

Ur-5, Ur-11, and Ur-13, and of the resistance genes present in ‘CNC’ and 

‘CSW 643’ (Table 4).  

 It was verified that the RR gene present in the common bean cultivar 

‘Ouro Negro’, temporarilly named as Ur-ON, is distinct from the other RR 

genes already characterized.  In addition, Ur-ON does not have allelic 

relationships with the resistance genes present in ‘CNC’ and ‘CSW 643’. 

Based on the evidences for independence of Ur-ON reported in the present 

work, we propose that this gene is unique and be named as Ur-14.  We have 

already submitted our proposal to the Genetics Committee of the Bean 

Improvement Cooperative - BIC (http://www.css.msu.edu/bic/) to be officially 

analyzed.

DNA Marker-Assisted Breeding Aiming Rust Resistance 

Gene Pyramiding in the Common Bean 
 

 

Abstract:  The agronomic performance of the common bean (Phaseolus 

vulgaris L.), the world most important grain legume for direct human 

consumption, is affected by several diseases.  Among them is rust, which is 

incited by the fungus Uromyces appendiculatus.  In our breeding program we 

used a gene pyramiding approach assisted by DNA markers aiming to develop 

bean lines with durable and ample resistance to this pathogen. The rust 

resistance genes Ur-5 (from ‘Mexico 309’), Ur-11 (from ‘BelMiDak RR-3’), 

and Ur-ON (from a carioca-type line ‘Vi-4899’) were combined in the 

carioca-type bean cultivar ‘Rudá’.  Initially, two different backcross programs 

were conducted separately to produce carioca-type progenies harboring 

individually the genes Ur-5 and Ur-11.  Molecular fingerprinting analysis was 

used to select plants genetically closer to ‘Rudá’ in the backcross cycles to 

accelerate the recurrent-background recovery.  The progenies obtained were 

intercrossed and then crossed with ‘Vi-4899’ (Ur-ON), using a tri-cross 

design. The resulting plants were screened with the molecular markers 

SI19460C (Ur-5), SAE19890R (Ur-11) and OPX11550C (Ur-ON) to identify those 

containing all the alleles of interest.  The selected plants were selfed to obtain 

the next generations.  The selection based on DNA markers was conducted up 

to the F4:5 generation. We were able to select F4:7 progenies showing all the 

DNA markers associated to the genes of interest and resistant to all U. 

appendiculatus isolates tested. They were also resistant under field conditions.  

Yield evaluations show that these selected lines are as productive as the 

recurrent parent ‘Rudá’ and other high performing cultivars currently grown in 

Brazil.

1.  Introduction 

 

Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is an economically, nutritionally, and 

socially important crop, especially in developing countries of Latin America, 

Eastern and Southern Africa.  It is grown and consumed worldwide in distinct 

areas and different seasons, mainly by subsistence level farmers with low-

technology input but also by farmers that use high input technologies (Pachico 

1989; Wortmann et al. 1998; Broughton et al. 2003).  Dry bean cultivars were 

grown on approximately 27 million hectares in more than 120 countries in 

2007, but their yield is quite low compared to other important grain legumes 

such as soybean and peas (http://faostat.fao.org).  One of the several factors 

contributing to this situation is the high number of destructive diseases that 

attack P. vulgaris.  Among them is the common bean rust, incited by the 

basidomycete fungus Uromyces appendiculatus F. Strauss (syn. U. phaseoli 

G. Winter), which can cause great yield losses.  This fungus is a highly 

variable and is among the most pathogenically variable of all plant pathogens 

(Stavely and Pastor-Corrales 1989). 

Bean rust is distributed around the world, but it effectively causes major 

production problems in humid tropical and subtropical areas.  Severe 

epidemics have been reported in Australia, China, the United States, and some 

areas of Europe.  Major losses have occurred in Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, 

Malawi, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.  In Latin 

America, the bean rust is also a serious problem, major losses occurred in 

Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, 

Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, 

Nicaragua, and Peru (Stavely and Pastor-Corrales 1989; Souza et al. 2008).  In 

Brazil, the disease causes major losses in south, southeast and central areas, 



 

 95

including the states of Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Minas 

Gerais, São Paulo, and Goiás (Souza et al. 2005).  Rust losses worldwide 

measured in greenhouse and field conditions can vary from 18 to 100% 

(Stavely and Pastor-Corrales 1989; Staples 2000).  Yield losses higher than 

68% were detected in Minas Gerais state in southeastern Brazil (Vieira et al. 

2005). 

 No single control or disease management measure can be recommended 

for rust.  Management of this disease has relied primarily on three strategies: 

application of fungicides, host resistance, and various cultural practices.  The 

use of resistant cultivars is certainly the main component of the integrated 

bean rust management.  The pyramiding of different race-specific resistance 

genes is an important strategy for developing broad and durable resistance to 

U. appendiculatus (Souza et al. 2008; Raganin et al. 2009). This approach 

using only conventional breeding methods has not been effective mainly due 

to the difficulties in selecting genotypes harboring different resistance genes.  

For this reason, molecular markers are often used to aid the pyramiding 

process.  The use of molecular markers not only eliminates the need for 

multiple and sequential inoculations but also the confounding effect of 

potential epistatic interactions among the different resistance genes present in 

the same genetic background (Michelmore 1995; Bigirimana and Höfte 2001; 

Singh et al. 2001; Toenniessen et al. 2003).  However, for each resistance 

allele a specific marker or markers need to be identified.   Several RAPD 

markers associated with genes conferring resistance to rust in common bean 

have been identified and some of them were converted into SCAR markers to 

increase their reproducibility (Souza et al. 2008). 

 Molecular markers can also be used to accelerate the recovery of the 

recurrent parent’s genome in backcross breeding programs.  Simulation 

studies and real data indicate that only three or four backcrosses are necessary 

to recover the recurrent parent’s genome when molecular markers are used 

(Openshaw et al. 1994; Faleiro et al. 2004; Ragagnin et al. 2009).  Separate 

backcross programs assisted by molecular marker fingerprinting can be used 



 

 96

for the individual introgression of resistance genes in commercial cultivars.  

This strategy can be the initial step for pyramiding rust resistance alleles. 

 The main goal of the present work was to develop high yielding 

carioca-type common bean lines with broad and durable resistance to U. 

appendiculatus. Carioca seeded beans are the most consumed in Brazil.  

Backcross programs were conducted separately to produce genetic materials 

harboring individual rust resistance alleles.  DNA fingerprinting was used to 

accelerate the recurrent-background recovery. Molecular marker-assisted 

selection was used to combine the distinct rust resistance genes in the carioca-

type genetic background.  The agronomic performance of the advanced lines 

obtained was evaluated in two growing seasons and the presence of the 

resistance alleles was confirmed by inoculations with the rust pathogen. 

 

2.  Material and Methods 

 

2.1.  Plant genetic material 

The Mesoamerican carioca-type common bean cultivar ‘Rudá’ was used as 

recurrent parent in all backcrosses.  It has been highly recommended for many 

growing regions in Brazil, but it is susceptible to rust.  ‘Mexico 309’ and 

‘BelMiDak RR-3’ (derived from ‘PI181996’) were used as donor parents.  

They are Mesoamerican bean lines harboring genes Ur-5 and Ur-11, 

respectively, that confer ample resistance to U. appendiculatus in Brazil 

(Souza et al. 2005, 2007a) and in other parts of the world (Stavely 2000; 

Steadman et al. 2002).  The common bean line ‘Vi-4899’, derived from the 

cross ‘Rudá’ × ‘Ouro Negro’ by molecular marker-assisted backcrosses 

(Faleiro et al. 2004), was also used as donor parent in the gene pyramiding 

process.  This carioca seeded line recently released in Brazil as the cultivar 

‘BRSMG Pioneiro’ (Moreira et al. 2006) harbors the gene Ur-ON from ‘Ouro 

Negro’. It is resistant to several isolates of U. appendiculatus and 

Colletotrichum lindemuthianum (Sacc. &amp;amp; Magnus) Lams.-Scrib., the causal 

agent of bean anthracnose (Faleiro et al. 2004). 



 

 97

2.2.  Crosses 

All crosses were conducted in the greenhouse.  Two separate backcross (BC) 

programs were conducted until BC3 generations using ‘Rudá’ as recurrent 

parent and cultivars ‘Mexico 309’ or ‘BelMiDak RR-3’ as donor parents.  

After each BC the plants were screened with the rust pathogen according to 

item 2.3 and the genetic distances between the resistant plants and the 

recurrent parent were determined with RAPD markers.  The plants closest to 

‘Rudá’ were used for the next BC cycle.  The BC3F1 plants selected based on 

these criteria were selfed to obtain the BC3F2 population that was inoculated 

with U. appendiculatus and screened with molecular markers linked to the 

genes of interest (Table 1).  The resistant BC3F2 plants presenting the DNA 

markers were selfed to obtain BC3F2:3 progenies which were submitted to 

progeny tests based on inoculation with the pathogen. 

BC3F2:3 progenies homozygous for resistance to rust were selected for 

the pyramiding process (Figure 1).  This process was done using a tri-cross 

design consisted basically of two steps: step 1 - pairwise crosses among the 

BC3F2:3 resistant progenies to obtain single-hybrids; step 2 - crosses of the 

single-hybrids with the common bean line ‘Vi-4899’ to obtain the triple-

hybrids with the three resistance genes of interest.  The triple-hybrid plants 

were screened with the markers SI19 (gene Ur-5) and OPX11 (gene Ur-ON) 

to confirm the cross.  Plants harboring both markers were selfed to obtain the 

subsequent generations.  The F2, F3, F4 and F4:5 plants derived from the triple-

hybrids were also selected with molecular markers specifically linked to each 

one of the rust resistance genes, which were identified in a preliminary 

genotyping test of the parental cultivars.  F4:5 seeds from the selected F4 plants 

were multiplied and the resulting plants were used for progeny tests based on 

screening with molecular markers to identify homozygous families for the rust 

resistance loci Ur-5, Ur-11, and Ur-ON (Figure 2).

2.3.  Pathogen inoculation and disease evaluation 

Brazilian U. appendiculatus mono-pustule isolates used in this work were 

characterized and classified into physiological races by Souza et al. (2007a).  

They are maintained in the fungal collection of the BIOAGRO/UFV Common 

Bean Breeding Program.  Artificial inoculations were carried out when the 

primary leaves of the bean plants reached approximately 2/3 of their full 

development, about 10 days after sowing under greenhouse conditions (20 ± 

5°C), as described previously (Souza et al. 2007a).  Each one of the BCnF1 and 

BC3F2 plants and 12 plants each of the tested progenies (BC3F2:3 families and 

F4:7 pyramid lines) and of a control cultivar were inoculated (Figures 1 and 2).

containing Tween-20 (0.05%, v:v).  The inoculum solution was sprayed on 

both leaf surfaces using a manual atomizer (De Vilbiss no 15) adapted to an 

electric compressor.  After inoculation the plants were transferred to a mist 

chamber (20 ± 1°C and relative humidity &gt; 95%) where they were kept for 

approximately 48 h under a 12-hour light regime.  In order to avoid 

contamination, plants inoculated with different isolates were kept in separate 

compartments of the mist chamber.  After this period the plants were 

transferred to a greenhouse (20 ± 5°C), where they were kept until symptom 

evaluation, about 15 days after inoculation. 

Six grades of rust reaction were considered in the evaluation of the 

disease symptoms based on the scale proposed by Stavely et al. (1983): 1- no 

pustules (immunity); 2 - necrotic spots without sporulation; 3 - pustules 

undergoing sporulation with a diameter of &amp;lt;300 ?m; 4 - pustules undergoing 

sporulation with a diameter ranging from 300 ?m to 499 ?m; 5 - pustules 

undergoing sporulation with a diameter ranging from 500 ?m to 800 ?m; and 

6 - pustules undergoing sporulation with a diameter of &gt; 800 ?m.  Reaction 

grades to the pathogen were determined visually by at least two researchers.  

Plants with grades 1 and 2 were considered resistant (R), those with grade 3 

were considered to be moderately resistance (MR), plants presenting grade 4 

were considered moderately susceptible (MS), and those with grade 5 or 6 

were considered to be susceptible (S). 

 

2.4.  DNA marker analysis 

Leaf DNA was extracted according to Doyle and Doyle (1990).  In each 

backcross cycle a screening was done to identify polymorphic RAPD primers 

(Operon Technologies, Alameda, CA) to be used in the molecular 

fingerprinting assays.  The primers that revealed at least one polymorphic 

DNA band among the analyzed plants were selected.  DNA amplification by 

RAPD technique was according to Faleiro et al. (2000).  The polymorphic and 

monomorphic DNA bands were used to build a matrix based on the presence 

(1) or absence (0) of bands.  The genetic similarity values were calculated by 



 

 102

the Euclidian method for binary data and used to cluster the plants by the 

nearest neighbor method with the aid of the program GENES (Cruz 2006). 

 For the molecular marker-assisted selection, including the progeny test 

to identify F4:5 pyramid families homozygous for the rust resistance loci, 

RAPD and SCAR markers specifically linked to each one of the resistance 

genes were used.  In the assays with the SCAR technique, the DNA 

amplification reactions were as described by Côrrea et al. (2000).  The 

annealing temperatures for the markers are described in Table 1. 

The amplified products were visualized under UV light after 

electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide (0.2 

?g/mL), immersed in a 1X sodium boric acid (SB) buffer (10 mM sodium 

hydroxide, pH adjusted to 8.5 with boric acid).   

 

2.5.  Agronomic performance 

Two field experiments were conducted at the Universidade Federal de Viçosa 

Experimental Station in Coimbra, MG, Brazil, to evaluate the pyramid lines: 

one in the Autumn of 2007 (F4:6 progenies) and other one in the Winter/Spring 

of 2007 (F4:7 progenies).  In the first experiment the only trait evaluated was 

grain production.  Besides this trait, reaction to rust and grain aspect were also 

evaluated in the second experiment.  Both experiments included 16 pyramid 

progenies identified as homozygous for all rust resistance loci by the progeny 

test based on molecular markers (Figure 2), 75 carioca-type progenies 

harboring one or two rust resistance genes derived from the backcross and 

pyramid programs, and nine reference cultivars: ‘Rudá’, ‘Vi-4899’, 

‘Majestoso’, ‘Pérola’, ‘Talismã’, and ‘VC-3’ (carioca seeded beans high 

yielding and widely grown in Brazil); ‘Ouro Negro’ and ‘Mexico 309’ (black 

seeded beans resistant to rust); and ‘Vermelhinho’ (red seeded bean 

susceptible to rust). 

In all experiments a randomized triple 10×10 lattice design was used.  

Each plot consisted of two rows each 2.0 m long, spaced by 0.5 m, with 15 

seeds per meter.  The equivalent of 350 Kg/ha of the formula 8-28-16 (N, P2O5 



 

 103

and K2O, respectively) was used as fertilizer during sowing, and 150 Kg/ha 

ammonium sulfate was applied 25 days after emergence.  Harvest of the whole 

plot was done manually.  The grain yield was determined for each plot and 

expressed as g/2m2 (g/plot).  Reaction to rust was determined in the field using 

the six-grade scale proposed by Stavely et al. (1983).  The grain aspect was 

evaluated visually using a five-grade scale as reported by Marques-Júnior et 

al. (1997).  In this scale grade 1 represents the wanted grain aspect (carioca-

type) and grade 5, the extreme opposite.  At least two separate researchers 

evaluated the reactions to rust and grain aspect.  The Tukey test was used to 

evaluate the significance of the differences among the mean values obtained 

for each trait. 

 

3.  Results 

 

3.1.  Development of pyramid lines assisted by molecular markers 

BC3F1 plants derived from the separate backcross programs using ‘Mexico 

309’ (gene Ur-5) and ‘BelMiDak RR-3’ (gene Ur-11) as donor parents were 

inoculated with a mixture of the U. appendiculatus races 29-3, 61-3, 63-3, and 

63-19.  The relative genetic similarities between the recurrent genitor ‘Rudá’ 

and the resistant BC3F1 plants varied from 80.8 to 98.1% (‘Rudá’ × ‘Mexico 

309’) and from 82.1 to 98.2% (‘Rudá’ × ‘BelMiDak RR-3’).  The total number 

of bands and the percentage of polymorphic DNA bands used to calculate 

these genetic similarity values were 39 and 48.7%, and 39 and 41.0%, 

respectively (Table 2). 

The resistant BC3F1 plants which were genetically closest to ‘Rudá’ 

were conducted up to the BC3F2:3 generation (Figure 1).  The carioca seeded 

BC3F2:3 families homozygous for the rust resistance loci were identified by 

inoculation with the U. appendiculatus races 21-3 (‘Rudá’ × ‘Mexico 309’) 

and 29-15 (‘Rudá’ × ‘BelMiDak RR-3’).  The selected BC3F2:3 families were 

crossed pairwise to start the pyramiding process.  The F1 plants obtained were 

crossed with the carioca-type common bean line ‘Vi-4899’ (gene Ur-ON), 



 

 104

derived from the cross ‘Rudá’ × ‘Ouro Negro’ by molecular marker-assisted 

backcrosses (Faleiro et al. 2004).  The triple-hybrid plants that presented the 

markers SI19 and OPX11 were selfed and 189 F2 seeds were obtained.  DNA 

obtained from the F2 plants was amplified with the molecular markers 

identified as specifically linked to each one of the rust resistance genes (Table 

3), and eight F2 plants were selected.  These plants were selfed to obtain the 

next generations.  For the selection of plants carrying all resistance genes to U. 

appendiculatus in subsequent generations, the presence of specific RAPD and 

SCAR markers (Table 3) was used as selection criterion (Figure 2).  Following 

this methodology it was possible to obtain 16 F4:5 families phenotypic and 

genotypically similar to the recurrent cultivar ‘Rudá’ and non-segregating for 

the DNA markers associated to the rust resistance genes.

3.2.  Agronomic performance evaluation 

The 16 selected F4:5 pyramid families were multiplied in the field to obtain 

enough seeds for evaluation of agronomic traits.  The corresponding F4:6 

families and 75 carioca-type progenies harboring one or two rust resistance 

genes derived from the backcross and pyramiding programs, in addition to 

nine reference cultivars, were tested for grain yield during the Autumn of 

2007.  The resulting 16 F4:7 pyramid lines and the other 84 treatments were 

also evaluated for grain production, reaction to rust, and grain aspect during 

the Winter/Spring of 2007.  The F-statistic (P &amp;lt;0.01) indicated that there was 

genetic variability for the three evaluated traits among the analyzed genetic 

material (data not shown).  The mean values for grain production of the F4:7 

pyramid lines did not differ statistically in relation to ‘Rudá’ and to other high 

yielding carioca seeded reference cultivars widely grown in Brazil.  These 

lines were also resistant under field conditions and presented grain aspect 

similar to that of the recurrent parent ‘Rudá’ (Table 4).         

 

3.3.  Rust resistance test 

The 16 F4:7 pyramid lines and reference cultivars were inoculated with five 

specific U. appendiculatus races and screened with the DNA markers linked to 

the rust resistance genes listed in Table 3.  The pyramid lines presented all 

molecular markers.  Nine lines out of the 16 pyramid lines were resistant (R) 

to all U. appendiculatus races tested.  The resistance spectra of these nine 

selected lines indicate that they posses the resistance genes Ur-5, Ur-11, and 

Ur-ON in homozygosis (Table 5).

4.  Discussion 

 

In this work we report a gene pyramiding approach assisted by DNA markers 

to develop carioca-type common bean lines harboring simultaneously the rust 

resistance genes Ur-5 – from ‘Mexico 309’, Ur-11 – from ‘BelMiDak RR-3’, 

and Ur-ON – from ‘Vi-4899’, a carioca seeded line derived from ‘Ouro 

Negro’ (Faleiro et al. 2004).  Carioca seeded beans are the most consumed in 

Brazil.  The use of gene pyramiding as breeding strategy aimed to develop 

high yielding lines with wide and potentially durable resistance to the rust 

pathogen, the fungus U. appendiculatus. 

The concept of molecular marker-assisted breeding was successfully 

used in this work.  The use of two separate backcross programs assisted by 

RAPD fingerprinting allowed the individual introgression of the rust 

resistance genes Ur-5 and Ur-11 in cultivar ‘Rudá’ after only three backcross 

cycles.  In addition, molecular markers specifically linked to the three 

resistance genes were identified and/or validated during the breeding process 

(Figure 1; Tables 1 and 3).  These markers were effectively used to aid the 

pyramiding process and the development of advanced lines harboring 

simultaneously all resistance genes in homozygosis.  The efficiency of the 

markers was confirmed by inoculation with specific races of the rust pathogen 

at the end of the breeding process (Table 5).  Yield evaluations of the 

advanced lines demonstrated that no grain yield penalty in relation to the 

recurrent progenitor ‘Rudá’ was observed after the pyramiding process.  The 

carioca seeded pyramid lines were also resistant under field conditions (Table 

4). 

The rust resistance gene pyramid of the lines developed in this work is 

now being transferred to modern carioca-type cultivars and to other bean types 

which are also consumed in Brazil, e.g., black and red seeded beans.  In 

addition, the pyramid lines will be further evaluated in different bean growing 

regions by a Brazilian Bean Assay Network for productivity and disease 

resistance.  If the superior agronomic performance of these lines is confirmed 



 

 110

they could be recommended as new cultivars.  New rust resistance sources are 

also being tested and added to our breeding program to widen the basis of the 

present resistance gene pyramid.  To be effective, the gene pyramiding 

strategy must be a continuous effort (Ragagnin et al. 2009).  

 Although gene pyramiding is not fully accepted by the scientific 

community as an efficient breeding strategy to develop wide and potentially 

durable resistance to pathogens, there are experimental evidence 

demonstrating that it confers more effective resistance than that conferred by 

the sum of the resistance present in the parental lines (Yoshimura et al. 1995; 

Huang et al. 1997; Singh et al. 2001).  According to Schafer and Roelfs 

(1985), the probability that a pathogen will overcome a gene pyramid of more 

than two genes is extremely low.  In order for this to happen, independent 

mutations in the pathogen genome must occur and they should be combined in 

the same genetic background, or they could occur simultaneously or 

sequentially in the genome of a specific isolate of the pathogen.  Thrall and 

Burdon (2003) also report epidemiology data that support the use of gene 

pyramiding as an effective strategy for disease control.  According to these 

authors, there is an inverse correlation between pathogen fitness and the 

number of avirulence genes present in its genome.  By studying the 

pathosystem Melampsora lini-Linum marginale in Australia, these authors 

observed that natural pathogen populations which were able to infect a greater 

number of host populations were less aggressive than pathogen populations 

which were able to infect a lower number of host populations.  The authors 

concluded that inactivation of several avirulence genes in the pathogen 

compromises its adaptability.  In other words, it indicates that gene 

pyramiding can potentially keep the disease below an economical damage 

level and also prevent its fast dissemination.
