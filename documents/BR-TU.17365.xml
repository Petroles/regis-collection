ABSTRACT 

The objective of this study was to evaluate nutritional 
and energetic value of rice by?products, with or without phytase, 
using growing pigs. Thirty?six male pigs were housed in individual 
metabolic cages. Total collection of feces and urine was carried out 
in two periods of ten days: five days for adaptation and five days 
for collection. A randomized blocks design was used, considering 
the sampling period as a block, with five treatments and seven 
replicates. Two control diets (with and without phytase ? Phy) 
were used in the digestibility calculations, the latter in order to 
evaluate the enzyme influence on energy digestibility of the tested 
ingredients. The control diet was replaced by 30% of one of the 
ingredients: defatted rice bran (DRB) with and without Phy 
and dephytinised defatted rice bran (DDRB). The use of Phy in 
the control diet did not influence DRB+Phy energy digestibility. 
Relative to DRB+Phy, dephytinised defatted rice bran had higher 
contents of ME and digestible protein but lower digestible P and 
Ca. Phy supplementation increased Ca and P utilization of DRB 
and improved energy and protein digestibility. The DRB without 
Phy showed the lowest digestibility coefficients for all responses. 
Metabolizable energy, digestible protein, phosphorus and calcium 
of DRB, DRB+Phy and DDRB were respectively, 2140, 2288 and 
2519kcal kg-1; 79.25, 92.41 and 107.10g kg-1; 1.62, 3.41, and 
2.11g kg-1 and 2.80, 3.79 and 2.90g kg-1.

RESUMO

O objetivo do presente trabalho foi avaliar o valor 
nutricional e energético de subprodutos do arroz, na presença 
ou não de fitase, para suínos em crescimento. Foram utilizados 
36 suínos machos, castrados, alojados em gaiolas metabólicas 
individuais. Realizou?se a coleta total de fezes e urina em dois 

períodos de dez dias: cinco de adaptação e cinco de coleta. Utilizou-
se o delineamento de blocos ao acaso, tendo?se considerado 
o período de coleta como bloco, com cinco tratamentos e sete 
repetições.  Duas dietas controle (com e sem fitase - Fit) foram 
utilizadas nos cálculos de digestibilidade, a última para avaliar a 
influência da enzima na digestibilidade da energia dos ingredientes 
teste. A dieta controle foi substituída em 30% pelos subprodutos 
testados: farelo de arroz desengordurado (FAD) com ou sem Fit 
e farelo de arroz desengordurado desfitinizado (FADD). O uso 
de fitase na dieta controle não influenciou na digestibilidade da 
energia do FAD+Fit.  Comparado ao FAD+Fit, o farelo de arroz 
desengordurado desfitinizado apresentou mais EM e proteína 
digestível, mas menos P e Ca digestíveis. A suplementação de 
fitase melhorou a utilização do P e Ca do FAD e aumentou 
a digestibilidade da energia e da proteína. O FAD sem fitase 
apresentou os menores coeficientes de digestibilidade para todas 
as respostas. Energia metabolizável, proteína, fósforo e cálcio 
digestíveis do FAD, FAD+Fit e FADD foram, respectivamente, 
2.140; 2.288 e 2.519kcal kg-1; 79,25; 92,41 e 107,10g kg-1; 1,62; 
3,41 e 2,11g kg-1 e 2,80; 3,79 e 2,90g kg-1.

INTRODUCTION

Grain-based diets contain enough total 
P to meet the requirements of pigs. However, 60 to 
80% of P is in the form of phytate (SELLE et al., 
2011); hence, the bioavailability of this P is low 
in pigs.  Defatted rice bran contains high levels of 
crude protein (15.3%) and P (1.89%) (ROSTAGNO

et al., 2011). However, about 85% of the total P is 
unavailable to non-ruminant animals as it is bound up 
in phytate (ROSTAGNO et al., 2011). This impairs 
P absorption by pigs and facilitates chelation with 
other minerals. Previous research by HASTAD et al. 
(2005) determined that some varieties of low-phytate 
corn had a greater energy content compared with 
conventional varieties. 

The use of phytase (Phy) to increase 
the use of phytic acid is already known in the 
monogastric feed industry. Phytase catalyzes the 
hydrolytic degradation of phytic acid (myo-inositol 
hexaphosphate) and its salts (phytate), resulting 
in inositol, inositol monophosphate and inorganic 
phosphate (MULLANEY et al., 2000). According 
to LIAO et al. (2002), phytate may decrease starch 
digestibility by several mechanisms. Supplementation 
of phytase may release starch and ?-amylase, thereby 
increasing the digestible energy content of the diets.

Besides the use of phytase, phytic 
acid removal from vegetable ingredients through 
industrial processes and/or laboratory methods 
have been employed successfully by SERVI et al. 
(2008) and CANAN et al. (2011). The removal of 
phytic acid from rice bran through these techniques 
aims to produce, as the main product, phytate, and 
generate as a by-product dephytinised defatted 
rice bran. Phytate is used in cosmetics and in the 
pharmaceutical industry, to help prevent certain 
human diseases such as diabetes (LEE et al., 2006) 
and kidney stones (SAW et al., 2007), and in the 
food industry to inhibit oxidative peroxidation 
(LEE &amp;amp; HENDRICKS et al., 1995). Nevertheless, 
dephytinised rice bran can be used in the feed 
industry, and may have higher nutrient availability 
because of its low content of phytate phosphorus. 
The aim of this study was to evaluate nutritional and 
energetic value of rice-by products, with or without 
phytase, using growing pigs.  

MATERIAL   AND   METHODS

Thirty-six crossbred barrows were 
used (PIC sire and female DB-DanBred). The 
experiment was conducted in metabolic cages and 
divided into two periods of 10 consecutive days, 
with 5 days of adaptation and 5 days of total feces 
and urine collection. Pigs weighed 29±0.73kg and 
37±0.55kg at the beginning of the first and second 
period, respectively. 

The dephytinisation process consisted 
of maceration of the defatted rice bran (DRB), 
solubilizing the bran in an aqueous solution followed 

by acidification of the solution. The methodology was 
developed by the Federal University of Santa Maria 
and a private company (INGAL®). The same source 
of DRB used to feed the animals was used for the 
dephytinisation process.

A randomized blocks design  was  used,  
considering the sampling period as a block, with five 
treatments and seven replicates. The experimental 
unit was the pig. The treatments were: (CONT) 
Control diet (ground corn and soybean meal); 
(CONT+Phy) Control diet with 100mg kg-1 phytase; 
(CONT+DRB) 700g kg-1 Control diet and 300g kg-1 
DRB (defatted rice bran); (CONT+DRB+Phy) 700g 
kg-1 Control diet, 300g kg-1 DRB and 200mg kg-1 
phytase; (CONT+DDRB) 700g kg-1 Control diet, 
300g kg-1 dephytinised defatted rice bran. The control 
diet with phytase was introduced because phytase 
could affect the reference diet, delivering nutrients 
that could be attributed erroneously to DRB.

The enzyme used was Quantum Blue®, an 
enhanced 6-phytase from Escherichia coli and with 
an activity of 6,800 FTU g-1. The digestibility of the 
DRB, DRB+Phy and DDRD were calculated by the 
difference (indirect) approach (ADEOLA, 2001).

Pigs received water ad libitum and the 
amount of feed, distributed in two daily meals 9h 
and 17h, was adjusted to give an energy consumption 
of 2.6 times maintenance, estimated as 250kcal kg-1 
EM×LW0.60 (NOBLET &amp;amp; SHI, 1993). The Control 
diet was formulated according to the nutritional 
recommendations proposed by ROSTAGNO et al. 
(2011) (Table 1) for growing pigs. Rice bran was 
included in the diet by a difference (indirect) approach, 
wherein 300g kg-1 of the control diet on a dry matter 
basis was replaced with the test ingredients.

Total feces and urine were collected, and 
the beginning and end of each collection determined 
by the appearance of marked feces with the addition of 
0.25% of ferric oxide (Fe2O3) in the diets. Feces were 
collected twice a day (10h and 18h), weighed, packed 
in plastic bags and stored in a freezer at -10°C. At the 
end of the experiment, the feces were homogenized 
and sampled (300g kg-1), dried in a forced air oven 
at 60°C for 72 hours, and ground for later analysis. 
Urine was collected in plastic buckets together with 
5ml H2SO4. The volume was weighed daily, and a 
10% aliquot was removed and refrigerated at -10°C. 

Diet, defatted and dephytinised rice bran 
and feces samples were ground in a knife mill with 
a one millimeter sieve, and analyzed for dry matter, 
crude protein, phosphorus and calcium. Gross 
energy was analyzed by bomb calorimetry (model

Germany). Urine samples from each animal were 
dried in a forced air oven at 60°C for 72 hours, and 
also analyzed for gross energy.

Determination of the coefficients of 
digestibility (CD) of dry matter (CDDM), gross 
energy (CDGE), crude protein (CDCP), calcium 
and phosphorus for the diets and ingredients 
were calculated. The values of digestible protein 
(DP) in the defatted and dephytinised rice bran 
were determined according to SAKOMURA &amp;amp; 
ROSTAGNO (2007). To calculate DE and ME of 
the ingredients, CAMPBELL et al. (1983) formula 

was used. From this calculation, the energy values 
of the two control diets, CONT and CONT+Phy 
were compared.

Data were analyzed in a completely 
randomized design, considering the period as a 
block, by ANOVA and LS Means using the GLM 
procedure (Statistical Analysis System, version 9.2). 
Pooled SEM was calculated by averaging the SEM 
calculated by the GLM procedure of SAS for the 
variable of interest. A level of P&lt;0.05 was defined as 
indicating statistical significance.  

RESULTS   AND   DISCUSSION

In the comparison of the two control diets 
(with and without Phy), there was no difference in the 
energy values obtained, independently of the use of 
phytase. Thus, all other calculations were developed 
using the control diet without phytase.

Dry matter intake was similar for all 
treatments, as expected since feed was provided in 
accordance with metabolic weight and the pigs had 
similar body weights (Table 2). The coefficients 
of digestibility of dry matter, gross energy, crude 
protein, Ca, P, as well as DE and ME of the two 
control diets were high compared to the other diets. 
This result is consistent, since the control diets had 
adequate nutritional balance in their formulations and 
less fiber due to the absence of rice bran (Table 1). 
However, CONT+Phy showed a higher P digestibility. 
Dietary starch and fiber are important nutrients for 
pigs but are underappreciated in their complexity 
(REGMI et al., 2011). Increasing  rice bran  levels in 
growing and finishing pig diets  had  a linear effect  
on  nutrients digestibility (KUNRATH et al., 2010), 
related to the increase in fiber content, since 
increasing  dietary fiber increases the rate of digesta 
passage (PARTANEN et al., 2007) and negatively 
affects the digestibility of many nutrients, even fiber 
itself (GOMES et al., 2007).

The addition of phytase to the diet 
with rice bran not only improved the use of Ca 
and P, an effect that is already well known in the 
literature (OMOGBENIGNUN et al., 2003), but 
also improved digestibility of dry matter, energy 
and protein, similar to the findings of ZANELLA 
et al. (1999). The diet with dephytinised DRB had 
lower dry matter digestibility than the diet with 
DRB+Phy, but similar gross energy and crude 
protein digestibility. The DE and ME of the diet 
with dephytinised DRB were higher compared to 
rice bran-containing diets. For the DDRB diet, Ca 
and P digestibility were lower than those for the

DRB without Phy. The DRB diet generally had the 
lowest nutrient digestibilities. 

Regarding the digestibility of the test 
ingredients (Table 3), control diet of dry matter, gross 
energy and crude protein were higher for DRB+Phy 
and Dephytinised DRB than DRB. These values agree 
with those obtained by NAMKUNG &amp;amp; LEESON 
(1999), in which the use of phytase increased energy, 
minerals, and amino acid availability in the diet of 
broilers. In the present study, the dephytinisation 
process had similar effect to the use of phytase 
enzyme in the animal.

The digestible protein (DP) of rice 
bran in this study was lower than that found by 

ROSTAGNO et al. (2011) (79.3 vs 114.1g kg-1), 
although similar values for crude protein content 
were noted (15.3 and 15.5%, respectively). A low 
crude protein digestibility (56.6%) was also observed 
by KUNRATH et al. (2010), and is close to the value 
seen in this experiment (51.8%), and lower than 
the values suggested by ROSTAGNO et al. (2011; 
74.6%). These variations may be associated with 
intrinsic and/or extrinsic ingredient characteristics, 
such as source and processing. In the two cases cited 
as having low digestibility, the rice bran was from 
the south of Brazil. The type of rice processing can 
also influence the chemical composition of the bran 
(DENARDIN et al., 2004).

The Ca and P digestibility was greater for 
DRB+Phy than for DRB. The phytase enzyme has 
proven to be successful for degrading phytic acid 
in the gastrointestinal tract of pigs, with increases 
in the amounts of calcium and phosphorus 
available, a response that confirms the results in 
table 2 and is in agreement with TRUJILLO &amp;amp; 
LINDEMANN (2010). The negative values seen 
in this experiment for Ca and P digestibility may 
be associated with the high level of complexed 
P in rice bran and endogenous Ca and P. The 
antinutritive properties of phytate include forming 
complexes with amino acids, inhibiting porcine 
proteolytic enzymes, and increasing endogenous 
amino acid secretions, thereby reducing apparent 
amino acids digestibility and decreasing 
availability of P, Ca, and other divalent minerals 
(SELLE &amp;amp;  RAVINDRAN, 2008).

The reduced coefficients of digestibility 
of Ca and P in Dephytinised rice bran compared to 
DRB+Phy may be associated with high amounts 
of phytic acid still remaining in the former after 
the dephytinisation process. The rice bran and 
Dephytinised rice bran  had 2.68 and 1.17% of 
total phosphorus, respectively (Table 1), showing 
that 44% of the total phosphorus remained in the 
dephytinised bran. According to SERVI et al. (2008), 
reduction of phytic acid by more than 90% could 
significantly improve bioavailability and absorption 
of minerals and proteins. Since dephytinisation 
did not remove all P, one can assume that some of 
remaining phosphorus was in the form of phytate, 
and supplementation with phytase could be positive. 
The dephytinised rice bran showed the highest 
values of digestible protein, DE and ME (P&lt;0.001), 
compared to rice bran independently of the use of 
phytase. The higher crude protein and gross energy 
found in Dephytinised, compared to rice bran 
(16.3% and 3,771kcal kg-1 vs. 15.3% and 3,494kcal 
kg-1, respectively, Table 1), and the slightly higher 
amount of starch (50.0 vs 47.8%) explain the higher 
DE values of DDRB. According to HURRELL 
(2004), removing phytic acid facilitates ingredient 
digestion because it prevents the chelation of myo-
inositol hexaphosphate molecules with multivalent 
metal ions, especially zinc and calcium. Phytate 
also binds with proteins, amino acids, starch and 
enzymes such pepsin, trypsin and alpha amylase, 
compromising digestion and absorption (CASEY 
&amp;amp; WALSH, 2004). The low nutrient digestibility 
observed with  DRB compared to DRB+Phy was 
also observed by SILVA et al. (2005), when phytase 

supplementation improved the apparent ileal 
digestibility of amino acids from defatted rice bran 
and soybean meal in growing pigs.

CONCLUSION

The dephytinization process and phytase 
addition improved the nutrient digestibility of defatted 
rice bran.  Metabolizable energy, digestible protein, 
phosphorus and calcium of DRB, DRB+Phy and 
DDRB were respectively, 2,140; 2,288 and 2,519kcal 
kg-1; 79.25; 92.41 and 107.10g kg-1; 1.62; 3.41, and 
2.11g kg-1 and 2.80; 3.79 and 2.90g kg-1.
