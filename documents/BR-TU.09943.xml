RESUMO 

 

 

 

Recentes acidentes industriais, como vazamentos tóxicos, têm causado danos 
catastróficos ao meio ecológico (i.e. plantas e animais), de modo que um método efetivo para 
analisar riscos ecológicos tem sido demandado. Em primeiro lugar, este trabalho tem como 
objetivo propor uma metodologia capaz de quantificar riscos ecológicos inerentes a eventos 
raros como acidentes industriais. Utiliza-se a modelagem populacional para simular futuras 
mudanças na abundância populacional de espécies-chave em risco e, assim, estimar a 
probabilidade de extinção ou declínio, tempo para extinção e outras medidas, para cada 
cenário acidental. Assim, foi possível desenvolver uma abordagem que combina os danos 
ecológicos (previstos através da modelagem populacional) com a frequência de ocorrência do 
cenário acidental (estimada através de dados históricos e análise de confiabilidade). O 
resultado é uma curva de risco FN (similar ao resultado de uma análise de risco a humanos), 
onde N é o declínio populacional médio e F a frequência acumulada de acidentes com 
declínio maior ou igual a N. Em segundo lugar, o trabalho apresenta uma aplicação da 
metodologia para quantificar os riscos ecológicos provenientes de acidentes associados ao 
transporte e manuseio de petróleo que abastece uma refinaria no Complexo Industrial 
Portuário de Suape-PE, no Nordeste do Brasil. Esta instalação está localizada próxima a um 
rico ecossistema aquático de alta biodiversidade. A população de uma espécie nativa foi 
estrategicamente escolhida para representar o ecossistema, alguns cenários de derramamento 
de petróleo foram simulados e suas frequências de ocorrência estimadas. Para cada cenário 
acidental, a concentração de óleo que atinge a população foi prevista via modelagem de 
destino e transporte. Os riscos ecológicos foram quantificados e apresentados em uma curva 
FN. Uma análise de sensibilidade foi feita para explorar como mudanças em parâmetros 
específicos causam mudanças nas medidas de risco. Além disso, a incerteza foi medida como 
um intervalo (limite superior e inferior) para as medidas de riscos com base em cenários 
pessimistas e otimistas. Finalmente, a metodologia mostrou-se viável, eficiente, conveniente e 
flexível, apesar de que algumas melhorias ainda podem ser feitas e estas foram propostas para 
trabalhos futuros.

ABSTRACT 

 

 

 

Recent industrial accidents such as toxic spills have caused catastrophic damage to 
ecological environments (plants and animals), so that an effective method to assess ecological 
risks has been demanded. Firstly, this work aims at proposing a methodology capable of 
quantifying ecological risks related to rare events such as industrial accidents. One uses 
population modeling to simulate future changes in the population abundance of key species at 
risk and therefore estimate the probability of extinction or decline, time to extinction and 
other measures, for each accidental scenario. Thus, it was possible to develop an approach 
that links the ecological damage (predicted via population modeling) with the frequency of 
occurrence of the accidental scenario (estimated via historical data and reliability analysis). 
The result is a FN risk curve (similar to the result of a human quantitative risk assessment), 
where N is the average population decline number and F the cumulative frequency of 
accidents with N or greater abundance decline. Secondly, the work presents an application of 
the methodology to quantify ecological risks originating from accidents associated with 
transport and handling of crude oil to supply an oil refinery in the Suape Port and Industrial 
Complex, in the Northeast of Brazil. This is located near a very rich aquatic ecosystem with a 
high biodiversity. A population of a native species was strategically chosen to represent the 
ecosystem, some scenarios of oil spill were simulated and their frequencies of occurrence 
estimated. For each accidental scenario, the concentration of oil that reaches the population 
was predicted via fate and transport modeling. The ecological risks were quantified and 
presented as a FN curve. A sensitivity analysis was made to explore how changes on specific 
parameters cause changes in risk measures. Also, uncertainty was measured by estimating a 
range (lower bound and upper bound) to risk measures based on best case and worst case 
scenarios. Finally, the methodology proved to be practicable, efficient, convenient and 
flexible, although some improvements can still be made and were proposed for future works.

1. INTRODUCTION 

This work is within the field of Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA), which has become 

an important part of the decision-making process for managing environmental problems [1; 2] 

and can be used to evaluate risks to plants and animals as a result of human impact. It has 

been considered in programs administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 

(EPA) and in similar programs administrated by environmental agencies in Canada, Europe, 

New Zealand and Australia. For instance, ERAs has been used in pesticide regulatory 

programs, support in decision-making about waste discharges, and remedial actions to clean 

up or treat contaminated areas, and installation of new industrial facilities. This work focuses 

on the last one, which makes ERA an important field of research within Production 

Engineering, since it is particularly useful in industrial establishments for providing 

information necessary to the processes of licensing, risk management, and environmental 

management. 

In general, risk assessment in industrial risk management should deal with risks to the 

totality of the surrounding environment originating from an industrial installation or activity, 

including the ecological environment (sometimes known as the natural environment), the 

human health and structures/technology/physical materials. Each one of these entities has 

little similarity in the variables used to perform a risk assessment, so that they usually need 

distinct methodologies, especially if it is a quantitative assessment. As consequence, ERA has 

become a particular field of study within the Risk Assessment. This work centers its attention 

in ecological risks, which means risks with potential to cause adverse ecological effects, and 

does not contemplate risks to the human health or to physical materials. In addition, because 

fire and explosion are events that usually cause minor ecological damage than toxic spills, we 

focus on threats caused by toxic spills, although the former can be treated as initiator events of 

the latter. 

With regard to current studies in the field of ERA, most of them (e.g., [2; 3; 4]) focus on 

risks caused by chronic interference (continuous and persistent) such as, for example, waste 

discharge, so that there is a missing link between ecological risks and industrial accidents. For 

that reason, this work falls within the context of ERA for industrial accidents, i.e. it deals with 

(rare) events with low frequency of occurrence but that may cause catastrophic damage. For 

the purposes of this work, rare events are defined as events that happen less than once per 

year.

In the recent Brazilian context, ERAs for toxic spills rely on subjective rules-of-thumb 

or opinions [5]. In other words, it is usually done by the comparison of the estimated 

concentration of the toxic substance in an ecosystem with reference values given by 

toxicological information, such as the Toxicological Information Sheet (TIS) provided by 

CETESB [5]. Therefore, this work focuses on quantitative assessments (i.e. estimate of 

quantitative values to the ecological risks related to accidents), in an effort to provide 

numerical basis to decisions in environmental and risk management. 

It is worth mentioning that the proposed methodology in this work was already 

published in the European Safety and Reliability Association Annual Conference, ESREL 

2011 [6]. Also, an extended abstract of the application example of this work was accepted to 

be presented as oral presentation in the Society for Risk Analysis (SRA) 2011 Annual 

Meeting [7]; and a paper about an improved version of the proposed methodology was

Annual Conference [8], the major international event in probabilistic risk assessment in 2012. 

1.1 Rationale and Contribution 

Recent industrial accidents such as toxic spills have cause catastrophic damage to the 

environment and consequently great economic losses to the responsible company. That is 

what British Petroleum (BP) painfully learned after the oil spill on April 20 of 2010, with the 

explosion of the Deepwater Horizon platform in the Gulf of Mexico, causing one of the most 

severe ecological disasters in history and a loss for the company estimated at 37 billion 

dollars to be spent on cleanup, fines and repairs. However, this leak could have been avoided 

with the purchase of an equipment of U$500,000, able to seal the well in case of accident. 

This resulted in a loss 74,000 times higher to BP, not counting the corporate image 

degradation and the loss in the value of its shares [9]. 

Several others dramatic industrial accidents have also occurred in recent years, resulting 

in the discharge of chemicals and damaging valuable ecosystems [10; 11; 12; 13]. For 

instance, the wrecks of the oil tankers Rena (2011), Prestige (2002) and Erika (1999); and the 

chemical spills at Doñana (Spain) in 1998 and Baia Mare (Romania) in 2000. Table 1 presents 

a summary of recent accidents in the world, whereas Table 2 presents accidents in Brazil. 

Besides these, a high number of less harmful incidents happen every year [11].

It can be seen that most accidents are caused by oil spills originated from transport and 

handling activities in the ocean. In fact, according to the database of the International Tanker 

Owners Pollution Federation Limited (ITOPF), it is estimated that from 1970 to 2005, about 

5.7 million tons of oil were discharged into the sea [14]. It is also estimated that about 

700,000 tonnes/year of crude oil and its derivatives are dumped into aquatic environments 

[15], and the time to recover coastal environments that have been impacted by crude oil can 

vary from four to one hundred years [15]. Particularly in Brazil, there were about 30 serious 

accidents with oil spill between 1990 and 2000 [11]. Also, as the global demand for oil grows 

[16], so does the quantity of this product and its derivatives being produced, processed, stored 

and transported, and consequently increases the potential to cause serious ecological damage. 

The high frequency of industrial accidents, the increasing potential for damage, and the 

current need for sustainable development suggest that preventive measures must be improved, 

and the risk assessment is the groundwork for any plan to implement preventive measures. In 

this sense, the greatest contribution of a QERA is to provide information to maximize the 

efficiency of risk management measures. Miscalculating risks leads to inefficiency, i.e. 

underestimating them may lead to inadequate risk management to control and prevent adverse 

effects to the ecological environment, whereas overestimating them lead to waste of resources 

to mitigate apparent problems that are not really important. 

There are several other benefits of a QERA for establishments that handle hazardous 

substances [2; 17]: 



5 

 

• allows to systematically identify the existing ecological risks, leading to an 

improved level of preparation to emergencies; 

• allows to examine the population dynamics of native species in surrounding 

ecosystems; 

• it is an iterative process, so that new information can be incorporated into risk 

assessments in order to improve the results; 

• it can be used to express changes in the ecological risks as a function of changes 

in preventive measures or changes in the project of the establishment. This 

capability may be particularly useful to the decision maker who must evaluate 

tradeoffs, examine different alternatives, or determine the extent to which risk 

must be reduced to achieve a given outcome; 

• it can deal with uncertainty, measuring it and communicating it to risk managers 

on a quantitative basis; 

• it can deal with environmental variability (i.e. natural variation of environmental 

conditions in time and space); 

• allows the quantification of risks, which provides a basis for comparing, ranking 

and prioritizing risks. It can also be useful in cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness 

analyses related to the alternative management options to the reduction of risk; 

• provides numerical basis of knowledge for communicating the risks to 

stakeholders; 

• provides relevant information to tackle many key gaps in environmental 

management, such as optimal resource allocation for monitoring affected areas, 

optimal management of threatened and endangered species, and spatial planning 

for landscape restoration and management; 

• the assessment may aggregate value to the product of the organization, by being 

promoted as sustainable policy. 

To help improve the consistency and quality of QERA, some methodologies have been 

developed. EPA provides a detailed guide to the process of ERA [2], but they consider risks 

caused by almost surely events only (e.g., use of pesticides, waste discharge, chronic 

pollution), i.e. events that happen with probability one and usually cause minor ecological 

damage. They do not contemplate industrial accidents, i.e. (rare) events with low frequency of 

occurrence but that may cause catastrophic damage.

Camacho [17] proposes a methodology named Quantitative Environmental Risk 

Assessment. This integrates a methodology to analyze the risk of industrial accidents with 

another methodology to analyze the potential of chemical effects on not only the wildlife (i.e. 

ecological risks), but also on others environmental components: humans and economy. 

However, he presents no definitive procedures for quantifying ecological risks. Actually, in 

the case study of his work, he considers only effects to the human health, so that the 

environment is limited to human-beings and the application of his methodology falls in the 

case of standard human Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) methodology [18]. 

The previous methodologies have a common limitation: the missing link between 

ecological risks and industrial accidents. In order to tackle this limitation, Stam et al. proposes 

a model to assess risk for the aquatic ecological environment related to industrial installations 

[19]. This model, called PROTEUS, considers both a probabilistic approach for industrial 

accidents (particularly industrial spills) and adverse ecological effects. The former is 

calculated based on standard QRA methodology [18] and uses correction factors needed in 

order to assess the risk from an activity under local circumstances. The latter is calculated as a 

volume of potentially contaminated surface water separately for (1) toxic effects, (2) lack of 

oxygen and (3) formation of a floating layer, and selecting the maximum of these effects.  

However, PROTEUS predicts a volume of potentially contaminated water for 

representing ecological effects, but the presence of a certain quantity of contaminant does not 

necessarily mean relevant ecological risk [20]. For this reason, one relevant drawback of 

PROTEUS cannot be ignored: it fails to directly and explicitly quantify impacts on ecological 

entities (such as populations). For example, the toxic effects are estimated by the inaccurate 

approach that simply compares the predicted concentration with a toxicity threshold (effect 

concentration, EC50) for algae, arthropods or fish, i.e. the hazard quotient approach (section 

2.4 provides more information about this limitation). Furthermore, even though a volume of 

potentially contaminated water is calculated, it is hard to determine if the risk is significant or 

not, because each specific aquatic ecosystem has its specific response to a certain 

contaminated water volume, so that QERAs with PROTEUS need a qualitative evaluation of 

at the end. In summary, the results of PROTEUS are not directly useful for risk managers and 

stakeholders. They still need a subjective evaluation of ecologists before being presented. 

As a way around these shortcomings, the main contribution of this work is to provide a 

methodology that considers both the accident’s frequency and the magnitude of the adverse 

ecological effects. The proposed methodology is capable of quantifying ecological risks 



7 

 

caused by events with low frequency of occurrence and catastrophic consequences. It focus 

on ecological impacts. Moreover, it uses mathematical modeling applied to ecology (i.e. 

population modeling [3; 20]) to extrapolate toxicological effects on individual organisms to 

population-level effects (e.g. effects on abundance or growth rate). The Figure 1.1 illustrates 

the main goal of the proposed methodology, which is to integrate data on four different 

studies that provide relevant information to understand ecological risks related to industrial 

accidents, i.e.: fate and transport models that describe and predict the dispersion and 

concentration of chemicals in the water, air, or soil; reliability analysis to estimate accidents’ 

frequencies of occurrence; ecotoxicology that provides individual-level effects as a function 

of toxic exposure; and ecological modeling that translates individual-level into population-

level effects. 

 

Figure 1.1 - Proposed methodology as a means of integrating data from several fields of study 
that provide relevant information for ecological risk quantification. 

Again and again, the proposed methodology is not limited to assess ecological damage 

to individuals (individual-level effects), that often leads to inaccurate risk estimates and thus 

errors in environmental and risk management decisions. The methodology makes use of 

ecological modeling in risk assessment [3; 20], that explicitly quantify impacts on ecological 



8 

 

entities and can provide a more powerful basis for expressing ecological risks. This way, it 

incorporates population modeling in order to predict the responses of population to toxic 

exposure (population-level effects) and taking into account the relationships between 

individuals, the life history and ecology of a native species in the surrounding ecosystem. 

1.2 Objectives 

1.2.1 General objective 

To propose a methodology for quantitative risk assessment for industrial accidents with 

potential to cause adverse effects on ecological environments, i.e. plants and animals 

(excluding people, pets and physical materials). 

1.2.2 Specific objectives 

• To select and integrate ideas, possibilities, methods and guidelines that could 

improve the process of quantifying ecological risks; 

• To propose the quantification of the frequency of occurrence of accidental 

scenarios via reliability analysis; 

• To propose exposure and consequence assessment (e.g. fate and transport 

modeling, exposure-response assessment, population modeling)  as means of 

describing the ecological damage (i.e. quantifying the magnitude of the 

consequences) caused by accidental toxic spills; 

• To contemplate both the frequency of occurrence and consequences in a single 

risk measure; 

• To divide the methodology into steps and describe them in details; 

• To employ worst-case criteria throughout the proposed methodology to screen 

out accidental scenarios that have insignificant contribution to the final 

ecological risk, thus avoiding waste of resources and time; 

• To build a comprehensive scheme that illustrates the steps and criteria in 

conducting the methodology; 

• To justify all assumptions and criteria of the methodology; 

• To test the efficiency and practicability of the methodology by applying it to 

conduct a QERA in an industrial activity that deals with huge amounts of toxic 

chemicals, i.e. activities of transport and handling of crude oil to supply the 



9 

 

Abreu e Lima oil refinery (RNEST), to be constructed within the Suape Port and 

Industrial Complex (SPIC), in Ipojuca, Pernambuco, Brazil. 

1.3 Expected results 

It is expected that the methodology will be capable of effectively quantifying ecological 

risks (at population-level) caused by accidental toxic spills. More specifically, it is expected 

that the methodology should: 

• Make predictions that are relevant to environmental and risk management; 

• Provide information that allows the comparison among accidental scenarios, as a 

basis for prioritizing risk management actions under limited resources; 

• Provide a single risk measure that summarizes the ecological risks originating 

from accidents in a hazardous industrial activity, as simple way of 

communicating to stakeholders the total ecological risks; 

• Deal with uncertainty, measuring it and communicating it to risk managers on a 

quantitative basis; 

• Deal with environmental variability in time and space; 

• Be convenient and practicable in terms of costs, time and data needs. 

1.4 Structure of the work 

This work is organized as follows. Chapter 2 presents a review of the theoretical 

background for understanding this work. Chapter 3 presents the proposed methodology and 

explains how it can tackle limitations of other methodologies. Chapter 4 aims at validating the 

proposed methodology. It consists of an application of the methodology to perform a QERA 

in an industrial activity. Lastly, chapter 5 is concerned with the concluding remarks, i.e. the 

most important goals and limitations of the methodology, practical implications of the results, 

conclusions taken from the application example and future developments.

2 THEORETICAL BASIS 

2.1 Basic Concepts of Ecology 

Ecology is the science that studies the relations of living beings with one another and 

with the environment in which they live as well as their reciprocal influences, including the 

human aspects that affect and interact with the natural systems of the planet [21].  

For the purposes of this work, it is important to be clear about the definitions of 

environment and ecological environment. In accordance with EPA, environment is “the sum 

of all external conditions affecting the life, development and survival of an organism” [22]. 

So environment encompasses humans, physical materials and the ecological environment 

itself (i.e. wildlife plants and animals). 

As stated previously, ecology studies the relations of living organisms to each other and 

to the environment. The biological world is very complex, so it was divided into biological 

hierarchy levels, as shown in Figure 2.1. The ecology studies only from individual organism 

level to higher levels and EPA provides definitions to these [22]: 

• Organism refers to “any form of animal or plant life”. 

• Population refers to “a group of interbreeding organisms occupying a particular 

space”. Each population has its own characteristics such as abundance, birth rate 

(fecundity), deaths rate (mortality), age distribution, dispersion, growth rate. 

• Community refers to “an assemblage of populations of different species within a 

specified location in space and time. Sometimes, a particular subgrouping may 

be specified, such as the fish community in a lake or the soil arthropod 

community in a forest”.  

• Ecosystem refers to “the interacting system of a biological community and its 

non-living environmental surroundings”. 

• And landscape refers to “the traits, patterns, and structure of a specific 

geographic area, including its biological composition, its physical environment, 

and its anthropogenic or social patterns. An area where interacting ecosystems 

are grouped and repeated in similar form”. 



11 

 

 

Figure 2.1 - Hierarchy of biological endpoints. 
(From the ref. [3]) 

By the way, habitats used by most species around industrial sites are becoming 

increasingly fragmented by human activities and, consequently, several distinct populations of 

same species are living spatially separated, in spite of interacting at some level (e.g. exchange 

of individuals). In fact, there are relatively few cases where the entire population resides 

within a same area. Hence, most species are distributed across space as a large population of 

connected subpopulations, that is, as a metapopulation. According to Pastorok et al., “a 

metapopulation is a set of populations of the same species in the same general geographic area 

with a potential for migration among them” [3]. 

With regard to levels lower than individual organisms, i.e. organ, tissue, cell and 

molecule, they can be biomarkers. These are measures of body fluids, cells, tissues or 

measures taken on the whole organism, which indicate (in biochemical, cellular, 

physiological, compartmental or energetic terms) the presence of contaminants or the 

magnitude of the response of the target organism [23]. Still, the National Institute of 

Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) states that “biomarkers play an important role in 

understanding the relationships between exposure to environmental chemicals, the 

development of chronic human diseases, and the identification of subgroups that are at 

increased risk for disease” [24]. 

All these explanations complement each other and help to understand that ERA can be 

conducted at all levels within the biological hierarchy (including biomarkers). Nevertheless, 



12 

 

the methodology proposed in this work focus on population- and metapopulation-level risks, 

i.e. the potential for adverse effects on (meta)populations. Readers are referred to the 

reference [3] for models that are potentially useful for risk assessment at higher-levels and to 

a series of four papers, commissioned by the European Science Foundation [25; 26; 27; 28], 

for the use of biomarkers in ERA. 

2.1.1 Ecotoxicology 

The term ecotoxicology was proposed in 1969 by the toxicologist René Truhaut during 

a meeting of the Committee of the International Council of Scientific Unions, in Stockholm. 

According to Truhaut, ecotoxicology is defined as "the branch of toxicology concerned with 

the study of toxic effects, caused by natural or synthetic pollutants, to the constituents of 

ecosystems, animal (including human), vegetable and microbial, in an integral context” [29]. 

In the 1960s, based on acute toxicity tests results, the Water Quality Act – USA 

established the first water quality standards in order to protect the aquatic life. In the same 

period, researches were developed focusing on the selection of sensitive and representative 

organisms of the aquatic environment and on the cultivation of organisms in laboratory. In the 

same decade, the book Silent Spring, written by Rachel Carson, was published. It was widely 

read and began to diffuse to the public concerns about pesticides and environment pollution. 

In the book, she calls attention to the harming and killing of not only animals and birds but 

also humans caused by the uncontrolled and unexamined pesticide use. 

Throughout 1970s, some American researchers noticed that limits established for many 

toxic agents separately could not preserve, effectively, the water quality necessary to maintain 

the aquatic life. With this in mind, the aquatic toxicology had a rapid development due to the 

knowledge of complex liquid effluents toxicity and the interactions between toxic agents in 

effluents and its effects on aquatic biota. Besides that, sophisticated systems were developed 

in order to conduct acute and chronic toxicity tests, using fish eggs and larvae to evaluate the 

toxic effects of chemical substances on different life stages of organisms. [30] 

During the 1980s and 1990s, validation studies of laboratory toxicity tests and collected 

aquatic water field data results showed the importance of selecting representative species of to 

evaluate toxic effects on an ecosystem. Afterwards, the implementation of ecotoxicology tests 

was intensified for the establishment of water quality standards. [30] 

Nowadays, the ecotoxicology plays an important role in ERA because it provides basis 

of knowledge about toxic effects on individual organisms caused by chemical exposure as 

well as about the representative species in an ecosystem. Knowledge on individual-level 



13 

 

effects is essential to predict higher-level effects such as on population abundance (or 

density), on community species richness, on productivity, or on distributions of organisms. 

Likewise, because the assessment of all species of an ecosystem would require huge costs and 

long time, knowledge on which are representative species is necessary to make the assessment 

tractable. 

2.1.2 Population dynamics 

Population dynamics is an ecology discipline which studies changes in the population 

abundance. These studies are important to analyze and understand what happens to the 

population in natural conditions (without chemical exposure). Incidentally, population models 

are used to predict and simulate the dynamics of a population. This section will introduce the 

main components in population dynamics, whereas section 2.5 will present a comprehensive 

overview of population modeling.  

The populations that constitute an ecosystem are open systems, i.e., they exchange 

energy and matter with the external environment. Hence, any attempt to describe and predict a 

population dynamics requires knowledge about the interactions between: (i) system 

components, i.e., organisms which compound the population and (ii) the system and the 

external environment [21]. In view of that, to characterize the dynamics of a population it is 

necessary to define its survival, mortality and fecundity, as well as migration, foraging 

behavior and density-dependence when appropriate. 

 Firstly, survival means the number of individuals in a population that are alive after a 

given period of time and the survival rate indicates the proportion. Pastorok et. al. [3] defines 

the age-specific survival rate ???	(?)? as “the proportion of individuals present in a given year (?)	within a given age class (	) that survives into the next age class (	 + 1) in the following 
year (? + 1)”. Age-specific survival rates can be estimated by the equation below: 

??(?) = 
???(? + 1)/
?(?)        (2.1) 
Where 

??(?) = survival rate of individuals in age classe i at time ? 
???(? + 1) = number of individuals in age class (	 + 1) at time (? + 1) 
?(?) = number of individuals in age class (	) at time (?) 
In face of that, mortality is the number of individuals of a population that died in a 

given period of time. The death rate can be expressed as 1-??(?). 



14 

 

With regard to fecundity (F), by definition, it means “the number of live offspring per 

individual in a given age class that will survive to be counted in the first age class” [31]. 

Incidentally, calculating fecundity depends on the available data and two brief examples 

might clarify it. On the one hand, e.g., for oviparous animals, fecundity can be estimated by 

the equation: 

? = ???????	????	???	??????? × ??? !?!	?	?" ?	?????	$?? × ??? !?!	?	?"	 ?	?????	$????%	%	$?	? 	???	0	"????,   (2.2) 
where the probability of hatching and the probability of hatching surviving to age 0 year are 

empirically derived species-specific value between 0 and 1. In this case, it is not enough to 

derive F on the basis of knowledge about only the actual number of eggs laid, i.e. one has to 

include the probability of hatching and the probability that the newly hatched fry will survive 

until the next census to recruit into age class 0. 

On the other hand, if sufficient data is available, fecundity can be estimated by the 

equation: 

?'()	?(?) = ? *+,*,+-?,.	,/	'()	0	1)'+	234).?5)6	-7'-	8)+)	*+,93:)9	;1	?.9?4?93'56	?.	'()	:5'66	?	'-	-?&lt;)	-?×=&gt;?@ABC	DE	F?GB&gt;HIBJ	KL	LH@B	-?? M.3&lt;;)+	,/	?.9?4?93'56	?.	'()	:5'66	?	'-	-?&lt;)	-  (2.3) 
In an effort to estimate survival and fecundity, field data need to be collected. 

Determining survival rates requires a minimum of two consecutive yearly field censuses; in 

fact, the results will be more reliable if data from three of more consecutive years are 

available. In addition to that, Pauwels suggests that the censuses should be consecutive to 

follow the age classes from one year to the next and to estimate age-specific survival rates, 

but if data for the target species are insufficient then one could extrapolate the information 

from the related species to the target species [31]. 

Let us now examine features concerning the movement of a population, i.e. migration 

and foraging behavior. The term migration denotes the movement of all or part of a 

population from one habitat to another [32]. Incidentally, it is the main way of interaction 

between populations within a metapopulation. 

Foraging behavior consists in all methods used by an organism to acquire and utilize 

sources of energy and nutrients. This encompasses location, storage, consumption and 

retrieval of resources. Moreover, the foraging theory tries to predict how an animal would 

choose to forage within its habitat, considering the knowledge of competition, predation risk, 

and resource availability [33]. The larger the foraging area, more food will be available. In 

contrast, the organism will spend more energy and take more risk, since the exposure to 

predators in areas beyond its natural habitat will be greater. It is important to emphasize that 



15 

 

the population foraging area should be considered in a QERA when the spatial structure of the 

environment has important effects on the population dynamics. 

Another very important mechanistic process within the population dynamics is its 

regulation via density dependence on survival, mortality, fecundity and movement of 

populations. It is the phenomenon of population growth rate depending on the current 

population density (or abundance). In other words, according to Akçakaya, density 

dependence “is any non-constant relationship between population growth rate and the current 

population size” [34].  

As is observed in wildlife populations, they are often changing in size, but fluctuating 

around an equilibrium abundance for long time periods, unless a disturbance occurs (e.g. 

pollution, harvest, culling, poaching, catastrophe, etc.). Consequently, it is important to 

incorporate density dependence to describe a population dynamics because it causes the 

population to reach a stationary state (which may fluctuate due to stochasticity only). The 

equilibrium abundance is also known as the carrying capacity. In other words, as stated by 

Akçakaya, “the carrying capacity is the level of abundance above which the population tends 

to decline” [35]. 

There are many possible mechanisms that yield density dependence: fecundity may 

decrease, mortality may increase with competition for limited resources, the crowded 

conditions may lead to social strife or cannibalisms. Population growth may also be affected 

negatively as population size reach very low levels. This phenomenon, arising from Allee 

effects [36; 37], draws a small population away from the carrying capacity and toward 

extinction. 

Usually, to enhance population growth, density dependence factors decrease mortality, 

increase fecundity, decrease emigration, or increase immigration (i.e. positive density 

dependence). By contrast, to retard population growth, they increase mortality, decrease 

fecundity, increase emigration, or decrease immigration (i.e. negative density dependence). A 

brief example can clarify the concept of density-dependence: on the one hand, when there are 

too many organisms living in the same space and being part of the same population, food may 

become less available and competition among the individuals starts. Consequently, negative 

density dependence manifests itself (e.g., more individuals dying and emigrating) so that the 

abundance will decrease to a quantity in which food is sufficient for all individuals again. 

To conclude, another fundamental component of a population dynamics is the natural 

variability in all its components. In other words, changes in survival, fecundity, migration and 



16 

 

carrying capacity may occur in an unpredictable fashion. For this reason, any attempt to 

describe a population dynamics should account for stochasticity in those parameters to better 

represent reality. Section 2.5.2  and section 2.5.3 provide guidance on how to model density 

dependence and on how to account for stochasticity, respectively. 

2.2 Risk, Hazard, Threat, Control Measure, Recovery Measure, Consequences 

and Accidental Scenario 

There are many definitions of risk in the literature, some are complementary, some are 

supplementary and others are even antagonistic. Each area of knowledge seeks to give its 

specific meaning; therefore there is no uniformity neither in the interpretations of risk nor in 

the methodologies to risk assessment. 

Camacho [17] transcribes the several definitions of risk which were the theme of 

discussion and decision of the SRA Committee on Definitions held in San Diego in 1987, 

entitled “Defining Risk”. It is presented a definition that is considered necessary and 

sufficient for the interpretation of risk in this work: the American Institute of Chemical 

Engineers (AIChE) defines risk as a measure of human injury, ecological damage or 

economic loss in terms of both the accident likelihood and the magnitude of the consequences 

[38].  

As this work focuses on ecological risks, the magnitude of the consequences regards 

ecological damage and is quantified as a measure of time and population probability of 

extinction (or decline). This measure is widely accepted and used by the scientific community 

in ERA as well as is the quantitative measure used by the International Union for 

Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to classify plants and animals at risk [39]. 

However, from an economical point of view, this measure does not completely value 

the magnitude of the consequences in terms of undesirability. Utility theory is used to value 

an unwanted event and so provide the most objective and relevant measure that a decision 

maker could have to rationally take decisions while exposed to uncertainty. Describing an 

unwanted event in terms of time and population probability of extinction (or decline) consists 

of about 80% of the efforts needed to value such an event in terms of undesirability. To whom 

it may concern, Campello [40] presents the new methods for assigning value to undesirable 

events, including a measure of risk aversion. 

To the purposes of this work, on the one hand, is the likelihood of occurrence of an 

accidental scenario and, on the other, is the measured consequence of this scenario in terms of 



17 

 

time and population extinction (or decline). The former is estimated using historical records 

and reliability analysis techniques (e.g. event tree, Event Sequence Diagrams, Bayesian Belief 

Networks) and it may involve both equipment failures and human errors. The latter is 

predicted via exposure and consequence assessment (e.g. fata and transport modeling, 

exposure-response assessment, population modeling). 

It is beyond the scope of this work to provide guidance on reliability analysis; for a 

general view on reliability theory, models, methods and applications, see the references [41; 

42; 43]; and for specific information about techniques such as Event Sequence Diagrams 

(ESD), Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN) and Human Reliability Analysis, see the references 

[44; 45; 46; 47; 48; 49]. Likewise, human damage are not within the context of this work; for 

methods to calculate the vulnerability and consequence on human health see the references 

[18; 50]. 

It is also important to differentiate between the terms hazard and risk. The former is a 

potential source of damage whereas the latter is the combination of the likelihood of 

occurrence of damage and the severity of that damage (in defined circumstances). For 

example, on the one hand, a great volume of oil under pressure has potential to cause damage, 

so it is a hazard. On the other hand, overpressure may cause an oil spill with defined 

circumstances (such as total mass released, time of spill, hydraulic flow) and cause a 

particular damage that can be measured. The combination of the oil spill’s likelihood of 

occurrence with the magnitude of the damage characterizes the risk. 

Concerning threats, control and recovery measures, and consequences, Figure 2.2 is a 

very interesting way of illustrating it. As already mentioned, hazard is a potential source of 

damage (usually in the form of energy). Threats are the initiator events which could cause the 

hazard to be released, although hazard and threats are sometimes taken to mean the same. 

Control measures (e.g., safety management systems, alarms, automatic stops) are barriers and 

preventive actions which can control the threats and avoid the occurrence of the top event, so 

that they reduce the top event’s frequency of occurrence and so reduce the risk. The top event 

is actually the accident. Recovery measures (e.g. re-routing of spills, burning the oil before it 

reaches an ecosystem, pollution remediation, habitat protection, translocation or 

reintroduction of individuals in the population) are mitigation actions which could reduce the 

magnitude of the consequences and so reduce the risk. Consequences are the damage, 

impacts, or effects. Importantly, preventive measures include both control and recovery 



18 

 

measures. And finally, an accidental scenario is consolidated by defined circumstances to all 

this factors.

top event, recovery measures and consequences. 

(From the ref. [51]) 

Lastly, there are two types of toxic risks: risk to human health and ecological risk. The 

former refers to the potential that adverse effects to the human health may occur or are 

occurring due to exposure to a toxic substance. The latter refers to the potential that adverse 

ecological effects may occur or are occurring as a result of exposure to a toxic substance. 

2.3 Quantitative Risk Assessment 

A Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) allows the quantification of risks, concerning 

since the frequent incidents with small impacts to even the rare events with major 

consequences. Thus, the QRA is necessary for objective decision making related to the 

security of the establishment, surrounding communities and ecological environment. The 

major motivation of carrying out a QRA is that in order to optimize risk management 

measures, they should be taken based on the results of a QRA. 

In other words, the QRA is used to demonstrate the risks caused by the establishment 

and thus help to prioritize which risks require some sort of action and in the decision to 

choose between different actions to reduce those risks. The actions for risk reduction may be 

quantitatively evaluated and compared according to their implementation costs through a cost-

benefit analysis. 

In Brazil, particularly in the state of São Paulo, since the publication of the declaration 

Nº 1, 01/23/1986 [52], by the Environment National Council (Conselho Nacional do Meio 

Ambiente – CONAMA), which created the requirement of an Environmental Impact 

Statement (Estudo de Impactos Ambientais – EIA/ Relatório de Impacto Ambiental - RIMA) 



19 

 

for licensing activities significantly affecting the environment, studies of risk assessment 

started to be incorporated into this process, for certain types of enterprises, so that, besides the 

problems related to chronic pollution, the prevention of major accidents should be also 

included in the process of licensing [50]. Thus, one more contribution of QRA is that it also 

provides the competent authority with relevant information for enabling decisions on the 

acceptability of risk originating from accidents. 

Currently, there are several manuals for implementation of a QRA. The Committee for 

the Prevention of Disasters (CPR), from the Netherlands, is a worldwide reference in the area. 

They published four books identified by colors (the purple, yellow, red and green books) [18; 

53; 54; 55], which are often used in environmental permits, based on the Environmental 

Protection Law, and in the fields of labor safety, transport safety and fire safety. Those books 

provide methods for the determination of probabilities, possible damage and physical effects, 

as well as guidelines for human quantitative risk assessment. 

In Brazil, the Environmental Company of the State of São Paulo (Companhia Ambiental 

do Estado de Sao Paulo – CETESB) published in 2000 a guidelines manual for preparation of 

studies in risk assessment (version only in Portuguese). This is the main reference on QRA in 

the country [50]. 

Although CETESB [50] cites the risk to the environment as a totality (humans, animals, 

plants, etc.) and highlights several times the importance of considering impacts to the 

ecological environment, they describe a methodology for QRA capable of quantifying risks to 

the human health only (surrounding communities), and not to the ecological environment. 

Likewise, CPR [18] describes in detail a methodology for human QRA and presents 

separately (in its chapter seven of only one page), a few basic guidelines and references for 

Quantitative Ecological Risk Assessment (QERA), which are hardly enough for the purposes 

of this work. Hence, the next section presents the author`s view about QERA and the main 

references he used to form it. In advance, to our purposes, a QERA is nothing more than a 

QRA focused on ecological risks. 

2.4 Quantitative Ecological Risk Assessment 

Ecological Risk Assessments (ERAs) are conducted in an effort to translate scientific 

data into meaningful information about risks to the ecological environment. This meaningful 

information may be provided by assigning values to the risks (i.e. by quantifying the risks), so 

that an ERA can be addressed as a QERA. 



20 

 

The references [1; 2; 56; 57; 58] provide detailed guidelines for the process of ERA. 

Among them, the main theoretical reference used in this work is the one published by the U.S. 

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) [2], for being the most current and on the same plot 

as the others. 

EPA defined ERA as “a process that evaluates the likelihood (author`s bold) that 

adverse ecological effects may occur or are occurring as a result of exposure to one or more 

stressors”. However, for the purposes of this work, it was added the term “quantitative” to 

emphasize that the assessment attaches a value or a price to the risk, because that is the 

objective of our proposed methodology. As a result, we adjust EPA’s definition and consider 

QERA as “a process that evaluates and quantifies the likelihood that adverse ecological 

effects may occur or are occurring as a result of exposure to one or more stressors”. 

Adverse ecological effects are “changes that are considered undesirable because they 

alter valued structural or functional characteristics of ecosystems or their components. An 

evaluation of adversity may consider the type, intensity, and scale of the effect as well as the 

potential for recovery” [2]. They are evaluated through endpoints, i.e. assessment endpoints 

and measurement endpoints. According to Pastorok et al. [3], “assessment endpoints are 

defined as environmental characteristics or values that are to be protected (e.g. wildlife 

population abundance, species diversity, or ecosystem productivity) and “measurement 

endpoints are quantitative expressions of an observed or measured biological response, such 

as the effects of a toxic chemical on survivorship or fecundity, related to the valued 

environmental characteristic chosen as the assessment endpoint”. 

Endpoints could be expressed as effects on individual organisms, populations, 

communities, ecosystems and landscapes. Thus, the definition of QERA allows for risk 

assessment to be conducted at the various levels within the biological hierarchy (Figure 2.1). 

However, many QERAs consider only individual endpoints and fail to consider population, 

ecosystem, or landscape endpoints. 

Indeed, the typical QERAs suggests that ecological risk is characterized as a hazard 

ratio of predicted or measured exposure to predicted no-adverse-effect level expressed as a 

concentration or dose. This approach is also known as the hazard quotient, which is simply 

the estimated exposure divided by a toxicity threshold. Thus, one has a value to the risk, 

which tells whether effects on individuals are expected (in case it is greater than 1) or not (in 

case it is less than 1). Typically, a measured No-observed-effect-level (NOEL) or Lowest-



21 

 

observed-effect-level (LOEL) – see glossary for details - for the individual-level endpoint of 

interest are used as toxicity threshold. 

Nevertheless, the hazard quotient approach can only evaluate individual-level effects 

and is not able to provide useful information for determining risks to populations in a QERA. 

Furthermore, Pastorok et al. [3] presents several limitations of the hazard quotient approach, 

such as:  

• it can only indicate whether effects on individuals are expected, not the 

magnitude of effects; 

• the results are difficult to interpret when the hazard quotient for one endpoint 

(e.g. mortality) conflicts with that for another endpoint (e.g. fecundity); 

• results are sometimes ambiguous depending on the toxicity threshold chosen 

(e.g. LOEL, NOEL); 

• usually does not provide enough information to make a management decision; 

• population-level processes may compensate for adverse effects on individuals; 

• the life history and ecology of a species can strongly influence the effects of 

toxic chemicals at the population level; 

• at best, the hazard quotient can only be used to screen out risks that are clearly 

not a problem (when the hazard quotient is considerably less than 1). 

Hence, a QERA that ignores population-level effects and focuses only on individual-

level endpoints may lead to inaccurate risk estimates. This will cause errors in environmental 

and risk management decisions and lead to inefficiency. Overestimation of risk can lead to 

waste of resources to mitigate apparent problems that are not really important, whereas the 

underestimation of risk can lead to inadequate risk management to control and prevent 

adverse effects to the ecological environment. 

As a matter of fact, most toxicity data are expressed as adverse effects on individual 

organism, i.e. individual-level endpoints. So how to assess higher-level effects, if there are no 

toxicity data expressed as higher-level endpoints? 

Population-level effects or higher-level effects can be obtained with the use of 

ecological models in the QERA. Such ecological models are essentially used to translate 

responses in individual-level endpoints into effects on population, ecosystem, or landscapes 

endpoints. Particularly, when they focus on population-level effects, they are called 

population models.  



22 

 

In a very simple case, a population model can predict the expected numbers of 

individuals in a population in the future from estimates of survivorship and fecundity for 

individual organisms. Thus, chemical effects can be modeled by perturbing the survivorship 

and fecundity values on the basis of knowledge about changes in these parameters obtained 

from toxicity test results. [3] 

By the way, at the end of August 2009, a group of approximately 30 stakeholders from 

industry, government regulatory bodies, and academia met for a 2-day workshop in Roskilde, 

Denmark (RUC09). The purposes of the workshop were to discuss future uses of population 

modeling in risk assessment by industry as well as its understanding and acceptance by 

regulators. Forbes et al. found that “A major motivation behind this initiative is that, for the 

sake of more transparency and better risk communication, ecological risks need to be 

expressed in more relevant (value-relevant) units than hazard ratios, and these units will often 

be at a population level” [20].  

Moreover, the predictive accuracy of population models has already been validated. For 

instance, Brook et al. [59] validated the prediction of abundance and risks of decline by 

comparing the historic trajectories of 21 populations (collected from long-term monitoring 

studies) with the results of population models for these populations. They found that 

predictions were surprisingly accurate: “the risks of population decline closely matched 

observed outcomes, there was no significant bias, and population size projections did not 

differ significantly from reality”. 

All things considered, one advocates the QERA approach based on the use of ecological 

models (particularly population models) to obtain population-level measures, so that risk 

analysis can assess the probability of a population extinction (or decline) in the future under 

several environmental conditions, accidental scenarios and management actions. The next 

section introduces theoretical basis on the use of ecological modeling in risk assessment. 

2.5 Ecological Modeling in Risk Assessment 

Pastorok et al. states that “an ecological model is a mathematical expression that can be 

used to describe or predict ecological processes or endpoints such as population abundance 

(or density), community species richness, productivity, or distributions of organisms” [3]. 

Thus, population and metapopulation (i.e. set of populations of same species living spatially 

separated but with potential for migration among them) models are a classification of 

ecological models, in which the mathematical expression is essentially used to translate 



23 

 

individual-level effects (e.g., increased mortality, reduced fecundity) into population-level 

effects (e.g., reduced abundance, increased risk of extinction), so that one can estimate the 

risk of adverse effects on a population via toxicity data expressed as adverse effects on the 

individual organism. 

The best way to choose the assessment endpoints is to check if they are directly relevant 

to environmental and risk managers of the enterprise. That is, the risk assessor should keep in 

contact with these managers to build the ecological model. 

With regard to the use of ecological models in the context of QERA, they should also 

include toxicity extrapolation models, which are used to extrapolate toxicity data in order to 

describe effects on individuals depending on the species, measurement endpoint and exposure 

duration. Thus, with the use of ecological models, individual-level effects can be translated 

into higher-level effects (i.e. effects on population, ecosystem or landscape), and that is the 

basic rationale for ecological modeling in risk assessment. 

As a result, one can estimate the risk of adverse effects on populations, ecosystem or 

landscape via toxicity data expressed as adverse effects on individual organisms (i.e. 

individual-level endpoints). Moreover, once formulated the ecological model, it may aid in 

assessing natural recovery, in developing monitoring programs, in planning restoration of 

strategies, or in deriving remedial action goals [3]. 

To sum up, ecological models are used to extrapolate a measurement endpoint to an 

assessment endpoint. They can predict responses in the population, ecosystem or landscape 

(using assessment endpoints) via measured individual-level responses (using measurement 

endpoints). In the specific case of a population model, it is a mathematical expression where 

the dependent variable (usually the future population abundance) is predicted through 

measure endpoints (such as survival and fecundity rates) and the population abundance at the 

present time.  

It is important to note that there are several other components in population dynamics 

rather than survival and fecundity, as described in section 2.1.2, and they can also be 

incorporated into a population model. Some extensions to a population model are showed 

below (for more details see the references [3; 34; 35]): 

• age or stage structure; 

• sex structure; 

• parameters vary with time due to stochasticity; 

• parameters vary with time due to deterministic trend; 



24 

 

• parameters vary in space: population-specific models for metapopulations (e.g., 

ref [12]); 

• parameters vary with abundance: density dependence; 

• additive effects: introduction, harvest, migration between subpopulations in a 

metapopulation, and catastrophes (e.g., industrial accidents). 

Figure 2.3 and Figure 2.4 illustrate the idea of a very simple ecological model at 

population-level (i.e. population model); the former illustrates the natural dynamics of the 

population in the future (i.e. without chemical exposure) whereas the latter includes chemical 

exposure. In this very simple illustration, the future population abundance (assessment 

endpoint) is predicted through the survival and fecundity rates (measurement endpoints) and 

the initial population abundance. Once again, there are several other variables which can 

influence the future population abundance. Sometimes they may not matter much, but 

sometimes they may matter a lot. It depends mostly on the knowledge of the modeler about 

the population, on the available data and resources, and on the objectives of the modeling. On 

the one hand, including other variables makes the model more realistic, on the other, it 

becomes more complicated and more data is required.

25 

 

 

Figure 2.4 - Basic idea of a population model with chemical exposure 

 

Generally, field sampling is used for the estimation of values to the measurement 

endpoints and the initial conditions of the assessment endpoints, whereas an exposure-

response assessment is conducted in order to describe the relationship between the 

concentration of the chemical and the magnitude of the individual-level responses of native 

species (represented by changes in measurement endpoints). This relationship is usually 

specified by a dose-response function, so that it is necessary data on long-term effects of the 

chemical on the species being analyzed. 

Several ecological models and software are already available for use in risk assessment 

of toxic substances. Pastorok et al. [3] conducted a critical evaluation of ecological models 

that are potentially useful for QERA and ranked the various candidate models based on 

evaluation criteria that include: realism and complexity of the model (i.e. whether key 

processes are included and how they are presented); prediction of relevant assessment 

endpoints and utility relative to regulatory compliance; flexibility; treatment of uncertainty; 

degree of development, consistency and validation; ease of parameter estimation; regulatory 

acceptance; credibility (e.g. prevalence of users, availability or published reviews); and 

resource efficiency. Furthermore, the best models were selected for a more detailed evaluation 

and testing. 

Nonetheless, selecting the best model depends on the specific problem, so that the 

modeler must decide it taking into account the management objectives, the ecosystem, 

chemicals of concern, receptors and endpoints of interest, quality and quantity of available 

data, and available resources. Thus, model selection is usually site- or issue-specific. Besides 



26 

 

that, the level of realism and precision wanted as well as the quality and quantity of data will 

influence the complexity of the model selected [60]. 

Habitats used by most species around industrial sites are becoming increasingly 

fragmented by human activities and, consequently, several distinct populations of same 

species are living spatially separated, in spite of interacting at some level (e.g. exchange of 

individuals). In fact, there are relatively few cases where the entire population resides within a 

same area. Hence, most species are distributed across space as a population of connected 

populations, i.e. metapopulation. According to Pastorock et al., “a metapopulation is a set of 

populations of the same species in the same general geographic area with a potential for 

migration among them” [3]. This way, some ecological models are designed to link 

Geographic Information System (GIS) with a metapopulation model, combining geographic 

and demographic data for risk assessment. 

By the way, the purpose of the proposed methodology is to conduct a QERA at 

population-level. Hence, this work does not delve into concepts related to QERA at higher 

levels and it might be referring to “Population Modeling” instead of “Ecological Modeling”. 

The reason for choosing (meta)population modeling instead of higher levels modeling is that 

apart from providing ecologically relevant endpoints, (meta)population models are much 

more tractable than higher level models. Figure 2.5 illustrates this point of view. 

 

Figure 2.5 - Evaluation of modeling endpoints based on ecological relevance and tractability. 
(From the ref. [61]) 

Other several advantages of using population models in risk assessments are related in 

the reference [61]. Among them, Pastorok et al. states that  



27 

 

“Risk estimation based on population modeling yields value-relevant output (e.g. 
reduced wildlife population abundance, increased extinction risk) that can be used in 
cost-benefit analyses to support management decisions concerning siting of facilities 
and mitigation actions” [61]. 

 

It is important to stress here that population modeling will be incorporated into the 

methodology for QERA proposed in this work, which will then be capable of assessing 

population-level and metapopulation-level risks only, but not higher-level (ecosystem or 

landscape) risks. Despite that, it is possible to strategically choose (meta)populations of native 

species that can effectively represent the ecosystem integrity. 

Implementing a population model for a QERA is actually an iterative process that 

involves data gathering, modeling, model validation, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. The 

steps in implementing a population model for a QERA will be described in section 3.5. For a 

detailed guidance on population modeling see the reference [35] as well as the reference [3] 

for population modeling applied to risk assessment. 

Once a population model is formulated (i.e. a mathematical expression), one has a 

deterministic model (i.e. no probabilistic components) to predict adverse effects on 

populations given the exposure to a chemical (in concentration or dose). However, as already 

mentioned, any realistic attempt to model population dynamics should account for 

stochasticity, especially because fluctuation is an obvious and often predominant feature of 

ecological environments. More on this regard will be discussed in section 2.5.3. 

2.5.1 Age and stage structure 

The age or stage structure of a population refers to age/stage classes within the 

population. They attempt to consider the fact that individuals of different ages have different 

characteristics, which are reflected in their vital rates (e.g. survival and fecundities rates), 

whereas individuals of same age have similar characteristics. For instance, juveniles may have 

lower survival rates than adults or juveniles may not be able to reproduce until they become 

adults. Conversely, in an unstructured (scalar) population model, the population is represented 

by a single age/stage, which denotes the totality of the population. Thus, unstructured models 

are considered to be a special case of structured models, with only one class of organisms 

[35]. 

Structured models are useful if the vital rates of individuals in different classes are 

different enough to justify the discretization of their life span. Individual classes mean their 

ages or stages. For example, population model of a fish with a life span of nearly 4 years 



28 

 

could be structured by their ages, e.g.: zero year old, one year, two years and three year; or by 

their stages: juveniles (zero year old) and adults (one year old or more). The criteria to 

structure a model by stages instead of ages are: individual’s ages are unknown; vital rates 

depend on stage or size rather than age; growth is plastic, some individuals are retarded or 

have accelerated development of vital rates. 

Those individuals that are the same age/stage are assumed to have the same survival and 

fecundity rates. However, those rates may differ between classes. This way, an structured 

population  model has a survival rate, Sx, a fecundity rate, Fx, and an abundance at time t, Nx(t) 

for each age/stage class x. The abundances for each class form a vector of numbers (one for 

each class), whereas the vital rates are combined to form a transition matrix that is used in 

most population models to account for age/stage structure. In fact, it is a transition matrix 

which has a special structure, called a Leslie matrix for age-structured models [11; 62] and a 

Lefkovitch matrix for stage-structured models [63]. Above is an example of a Leslie matrix. 

 

N = O?0 ?? ?P?0 0 00 ?? 0 Q         (2.1) 
 

Where 

?? = ???%	%??	????	 ?		$R	%	R????		$	???	?????			?? = ????$R	?"	????	 ?		$R	%	R????		$	???	??????		 
 

The reason for arranging the survival rates and fecundities in the form of a matrix is to 

provide a convenient way to make projections of population’s structure from one generation 

to the next [35]. For example, for an age-structured model the distribution of abundances in 

the next step is given by the matrix multiplication: 

 

S
0(? + 1)
?(? + 1)
P(? + 1)T = O
?0 ?? ?P?0 0 00 ?? 0 Q × S


0(?)
?(?)
P(?)T      (2.2) 
Where 


?(U) = $??!??	 ?		$R	%	R????	??	???	??????			??	?	??	U 
 

Assessors may then choose which age/stage classes they are interested in assess. In 

most case, they will be interest in the total population abundance, which will be the sum of 



29 

 

the age abundances. In some cases, however, the may be interested in the abundance of a 

specific class only. 

2.5.2 Density-dependence 

Section 2.1.2 introduced the natural mechanism of populations to regulate themselves 

(i.e. density dependence). This section is particularly concerned about the mathematical 

modeling of density dependence. For more details on density dependence see the reference 

[35], chapter 3. 

To model density dependence, one must  

• Decide which stages will count towards the abundance. At times a great amount 

of individuals in a certain life stage will not cause impact on the population’s 

vital rates. For example, when adult birds compete for territory, only the adult 

stage would count towards density dependence. The abundance taken into 

account may depend on all stages, selected stages or even on an average of all 

stages weighted by their respective fecundities. 

• Determine the vital rates to be altered. Depending on the behavior of the 

population, density dependence may affect fecundity, survival, migration rates, 

or a combination of these. This selection needs to be coherent with the transition 

matrix. For example, in a model with a single stage, density dependence cannot 

affect survival rates because there are none. 

• Choose the form of the density dependence function. Modelers can define a 

density dependence function themselves, but there are functional forms of 

density dependence used in the literature, they are [35]: 

o Exponential: no density dependence. All parameters related to density 

dependence are ignored, only the stage matrix is used in calculations. 

o Scramble: as population size increases, the amount of resources per 

individual decreases. If the available resources are shared more-or-less 

equally among the individuals, there will not be enough resources for 

anybody at very high densities.  This process of worsening returns leads 

to scramble competition, and can be modeled by logistic or Ricker 

equations [64]. 

o Contest: if the available resources are shared unequally so that some 

individuals always receive enough resources for survival and 



30 

 

reproduction at the expense of other individuals, there will always be 

reproducing individuals in the population.  This will be the case, for 

example, in populations of strongly territorial species, in which the 

number of territories does not change much even though the number of 

individuals seeking territories may change a lot.  This process of 

diminishing returns leads to contest competition, and can be modeled by 

the Beverton-Holt equation [65]. 

o Ceiling: exponential growth to a ceiling. At each time step, the 

population grows exponentially, but if N is greater than the ceiling, then 

N is set equal to the ceiling. 

• Select function parameters. In case of scramble or contest competition, the 

carrying capacity (K) maximal growth rate (Rmax) need to be estimated. The 

carrying capacity is the level of abundance above which the population tends to 

decline. Therefore one should observe the equilibrium population size for which 

the number of individuals at the next time step tends to remain the same. Rmax is 

the maximal rate of increase when the population that is regulated by density 

dependence is not yet influenced by it because of low density. The greatest 

growth rate observed might be skewed because of stochasticity, causing wrong 

estimation of the parameter. Therefore a more convenient form of finding the 

value one wishes for is by making a graph of R(t) as a function of N(t) (number 

of individuals at time t) and using the y-intercept as Rmax. Since considering R(t) 

equal to N(t+1)/ N(t) would cause both the independent and dependent variables 

to be affected by N(t) measurement errors, a less biased option would be to 

consider R(t) equal to the geometric average of N around the time step t, i.e. 

V
(? + 1) 
(? ? 1)? . In case of Allee effects [36; 37], the A parameter is the 
population size at which the vital rates are reduced to half of the original value. 

 

It is important to note that including density-dependence in a population model to 

evaluate the impacts of pollution (i.e. chemical risk assessment) makes the assessment less 

conservative, because density-dependence effects cause population to recover faster after a 

pollution episode (except in the case of Allee effects). There is an intuitive way to understand 

this: after chemical exposure, population suffers from decreasing abundance as long as 

significant amounts of chemical remain present; on the one hand, if density dependence is 



31 

 

ignored, the population growth rate remains the same and population takes longer to recover; 

on the other hand, if density dependence is considered, then after a decrease in population 

abundance, the growth rate suffers an increase (positive density dependence), so that 

population recovers faster. 

2.5.3 Stochasticity 

The variability and uncertainty in populations and in the environment they live is a 

fundamental component of population dynamics, so that population models that assume all 

parameters to be constant (i.e. deterministic models) fail to account for unpredictable 

fluctuations of real population dynamics. Conversely, stochastic models allow us to consider 

these fluctuations. They involve replacing constant parameters, such as survival and fecundity 

rates, and carrying capacity, with random variables responding to a probability distribution 

function (PDF), usually a normal or lognormal with a certain mean and variance. 

There are many different kinds of stochasticity to be incorporated into a stochastic 

population model, such as:  

• environmental temporal fluctuations (i.e. temporal variation in parameters); 

• spatial variation (e.g., population-specific parameters for metapopulations); 

• measurement and sampling errors that introduce additional uncertainty in 

parameter estimates of a population; 

• demographic stochasticity (because individuals only occur in whole numbers 

and most parameters may be fractional numbers, there will be additional 

uncertainty in the number of survivors and births in the next time-step); 

• model uncertainty (i.e. uncertainty concerning the structure of the equations used 

to describe the population) 

• catastrophes (i.e. extremely environmental events that adversely affect large 

proportions of a population, e.g., fire, drought, flood). 

Each one of them needs a different approach to modeling the effects of their 

fluctuations. This work will not delve into each one of them; readers are referred to the 

reference [35] for details on this issue. 

Nevertheless, catastrophes will be an especial type of stochasticity in the proposed 

methodology, because it allows accidental scenarios to be considered as extremely and rare 

environmental events included in a population model with a certain probability of occurrence 

per time step that may either be constant or vary with time. In other words, at each time step a 



32 

 

catastrophe (or an accidental scenario) may happen with a certain probability. If it happens, its 

effects of pollution can be modeled by changes in parameters since the present time step; if 

not, all parameters remain the same. Section 2.5.5 presents this approach in more details. 

Pastorok et al. states that there are two kinds of model endpoints: state variables and 

risk estimates: 

State variables are expressed as population, ecosystem, or landscape 

indicators, such as population abundance, species richness, or landscape 

fragmentation index, respectively. [...] Risk estimates can be derived from the model 

output for state variables in several ways, but the most common is to run the 

simulation multiple times in a Monte Carlo analysis to account for variability and 

uncertainty in input variables as well as initial conditions”. [3] 

In other words, what Pastorok et al. meant is that risk can be estimated through multiple 

simulations of the ecological model via Monte Carlo. Since a stochastic model has 

probabilistic components characterized by random variables responding to a PDF, there will 

be a different result for each single run. Thus, the results will also form a PDF which will 

characterize the risk estimates (e.g., risk of extinction, risk of population decline). Following 

such a procedure will allow variability to be evaluated as a degree of confidence, as well as to 

estimate upper and lower bounds on risk measures to evaluate uncertainty.  

A simpler way to deal with uncertainties is to use them to derive worst and best case 

estimates of extinction risks, based on manual changes on parameters. Such procedure allows 

estimating a range (upper and lower bounds) to risk measures, such as time to extinction, or 

risk of decline. The greater are the uncertainties in parameter values, the wider will these 

bounds be. If they are too wide, uncertainty may be unacceptable and do not meet the needs of 

risk managers. At best, the bounds should be narrow enough to make decisions taken by risk 

managers based on the lower bound the same as those based on the upper bound (i.e. the 

difference between the lower and upper bound should be regardless for risk managers). 

All in all, a population model with random variables (and it should be present to better 

represent reality) is a stochastic model, since the input variables and/or initial conditions 

respond to a PDF. Hence, the model does not provide a single result, but a distribution of 

consequences associated to probabilities. The next section presents the ways of expressing the 

results of a stochastic population model. 

2.5.4 Ways of expressing the risk estimates 

The most traditional measure to summarize the results of a population model is the 

expected population trajectory (i.e. the expected number of individuals in a population in the 



33 

 

future), which is usually expressed by a mean, a ±1 standard deviation, a minimum and 

maximum values. However, several ecological-related problems and questions that population 

models address are phrased in terms of probabilities. For instance, a certain population of a 

certain species may have a 50% chance of extinction in the next 10 years (i.e. a “critically 

endangered” population according to IUCN, the International Union for Conservation of 

Nature [39]). 

The probability is usually derived from multiple runs (Monte Carlo) of a population 

model and may be expressed in many ways as bellow [3]. The selection of a specific 

expression for the probability depends partly on the objectives of the assessment and partly on 

available information for the species being modeled [3]. 

• Interval decline probability: the probability of a population declining by as 

much as a given percentage of its initial value at any time during the period of 

prediction. 

• Interval extinction probability: the probability of a population falling as low 

as a given abundance at any time during the period of prediction. 

• Terminal decline probability: the probability of a population being as much as 

a given percentage lower than its initial value at the end of a simulation. 

• Terminal extinction probability: the probability of a population being as low 

as a given abundance at the end of a simulation. 

• Interval explosion probability: the probability of a population equaling or 

exceeding a given abundance at any time during the period of prediction. 

• Terminal explosion probability: the probability of a population being as great 

as or greater than a given abundance at the end of a simulation. 

• Time to extinction: the time required by a population to decrease to less than a 

given threshold abundance. This work basically uses two threshold: total 

extinction (i.e. zero individuals) and “half loss” (i.e. 50% population decline). 

• Time to explosion: the time required by a population to exceed a given 

threshold abundance. 

 

Thus, for instance, to estimate the terminal extinction probability, one runs the 

simulation multiple times and counts the occurrences in which the population ends the 

simulation lower than a given abundance. The probability (of a population being as low as 

the given abundance at the end of the period) will be the number of such occurrences 



34 

 

divided by the total number of rounds. Clearly, the greater is the number of rounds, the more 

precise is the probability. 

By the way, explosion probabilities and time are especially useful when a population 

increase may be unwanted. For example, one may want to estimate the probability that a 

certain seaweed species outbreak will reach an ecological damaging level, because it 

consumes most oxygen available for fishes in the sea.  

Also, explosion probabilities and time are useful to evaluate recovery chances, when the 

objective is to estimate the recovery of a population under risk management actions. In such 

cases, it may be useful to estimate the time it will take the population to increase to a certain 

abundance (i.e. time to recovery, analogous to the time to explosion), or the probability of 

recovery within a specified time period (analogous to the explosion probability). 

To conclude, there are other useful single measures to summarize the predictions of 

the risk curves [34], i.e.:  

• Expected minimum abundance: the average (over all replications) of the 

minimum population abundance of the trajectory. It is an estimate of the 

smallest population size that is expected to occur within the simulated time 

period. 

• Median time to extinction: represents the most likely time required by a 

population to decrease to less than a given threshold abundance. It is the 

median value in the PDF of the time to extinction. 

2.5.5 Assessing impacts and risks of each accidental scenario 

Through evolution, most species go naturally extinct, typically within ten million years 

or so of their first appearance [66]. Furthermore, human impact may accelerate this time. By 

human impact one means not only industrial accidents, but several other kinds of human 

perturbations to the ecosystem that may be continuously affecting a wildlife population, 

especially if the ecosystem surrounds an industrial activity. Thus, even under the condition 

that no accidental scenarios might happen, a population has already an implicit risk of 

extinction.   

Therefore, assessing impacts and risks of an accidental scenario alone is not enough. It 

must be compared against the present environmental condition (i.e. a non-impact scenario) to 

evaluate the changes in risks. In a non-impact scenario, no future impacts may occur (e.g., 

accidental scenarios), but only impacts that are already affecting the population. 



35 

 

An accidental scenario can be compared with a non-impact scenario in two ways. Both 

of them can provide relevant information, so that a QERA should, at best, present results 

using both approaches. The first one considers only the impacts (i.e. the consequences) of the 

accidental scenario of concern, whereas the second considers both the frequency of 

occurrence and the consequences (i.e. the risks). 

2.5.5.1 Assessing impact 

It considers that the accident is sure to occur at a specified time during the simulation. 

This approach ignores that the accident is a rare event and considers it as an almost surely 

event at specified time. This is particularly useful to evaluate the impacts (i.e. consequences) 

of the accident, because it presents the population dynamics before and after the accident. 

Hence, one could compare an impact scenario to a non-impact scenario as a means of 

evaluating the accidental scenario in terms of increase in consequences. Then the results may 

be used to determine whether the predicted consequences are substantial enough to require 

pro-active response or action. For instance, this approach provides information to answer 

questions such as: 

• Does the population go extinct before the accident? And what about after 

the accident? 

• What will the population abundance of a species (e.g. sardine) be 1 year 

after exposure to the concentration of toxic substances (e.g. 

hydrocarbons) released by the accident? 

• How long after the accident would it take for the exposed population to 

decline by a certain value (say 20 or 30%)? 

• What is the probability of extinction in the population after the accident? 

• What is the probability of the population dipping below a given threshold 

(say 20 or 30% from the original population) at some point in the next 

year after the accident? 

• If we invest a certain quantity of money (say U$100,000) in mitigation 

actions that reduce the magnitude of impacts, what will be the extinction 

probability decrease? 

 



36 

 

2.5.5.2 Assessing risks 

It considers that the accident might happen with a certain probability (equal to the 

accident’s frequency of occurrence) at any time during the simulation. This is similar to the 

catastrophe stochasticity type (section 2.5.3). Thus, the results represents not only the 

consequences of the accident, but the risks (i.e. a measure that encompasses both 

consequences and frequency of occurrence). This approach allows the comparison of a non-

impact scenario with a potential accidental scenario, in terms of changes in risk measures 

(e.g., risk of extinction, risk of half loss). Also, it allows the comparison of the accidental 

scenarios among themselves, which is useful for prioritizing management actions. For 

instance, this approach provides information to answer questions such as bellow, considering 

that there is a certain chance of a catastrophic toxic spill: 

• How will the population abundance fluctuate during a period of 50 

years? 

• What is the change in the risk of extinction in the population? 

• What is the risk of the population dipping below a given threshold (say 

20 or 30% from the original population) at some point in a 50-year 

simulation? 

• How serious are the changes in risk measures in a simulation with a 

potential accidental scenario when compared to a simulation with a 

non-impact scenario? Changes may be serious if species jumps 

categories of risk (risk categorization will be discussed in section 

2.5.7). 

• If we invest a certain quantity of money (say U$100,000) in mitigation 

actions, what will be the extinction risk decrease? 

• And if we invest the same amount of money in control measures that 

reduce the accident’s frequency of occurrence, what will be the 

extinction risk decrease? 

• If we have only U$100,000 available for risk management, how to 

allocate this money in an effort to reduce risks the most? Which 

accidents prioritize? 



37 

 

2.5.6 Cumulating risks of all accidental scenarios 

Quantifying risks of each accidental scenario provides a basis for categorizing them, 

comparing them against a non-impact scenario, and prioritizing management actions. 

However, it may also be useful to cumulate risks of all accidental scenarios as a basis for 

communicating the total ecological risk. Therefore, this work also proposes an approach for 

cumulating risks of all accidental scenarios in only one measure, i.e. the FN risk curve 

(similar to the FN curve for the social risk in human QRA). 

Once again, N is the average population decline number (of native species strategically 

chosen to represent ecological effects) and F the cumulative frequency of accidents with N or 

greater abundance decline. This way, the greater the number of accidental scenarios in the 

assessment, the more points will have the FN curve, and so will it be more continuous. More 

details on how to build a FN curve will be given in section 3.6. 

2.5.7 Risk categorization 

Establishing risk criteria for acceptability in the FN curve is a slow and complicated 

process that requires the participation of society and other interested parties in its judgment. It 

was not an aim of this work to establish risk criteria for acceptability, which is a proposal for 

future works though.  

Nevertheless, the risk status originated from the approach in section 2.5.5.2 can be 

categorized according to the International Union for Conservation Nature (IUCN) threat 

categories [39]. One of the IUCN criteria (the only quantitative one) are expressed in terms of 

time and risk of extinction, so either risk curves or cumulative time to extinction can be used 

to categorize risk based on these definitions. This way, a threatened population may be 

classified into one of the 3 risk categories: 

• CRITICALLY ENDANGERED: at least 50% probability of extinction within 

10 years or 3 generations: whichever is longer (up to a maximum of 100 years); 

• ENDANGERED: at least 20% probability of extinction within 20 years or 5 

generations, whichever is longer (up to a maximum of 100 years); 

• VULNERABLE: at least 10% probability of extinction within 100 years; 

 

The IUCN risk criteria are expressed in terms of total extinction (zero individuals). 

However, these criteria are intended to classify species at high risk of global extinction in an 

effort to convey the urgency of conservation issues to the international community. It is used 



38 

 

to classify species affected by a whole range of environmental changes and human impact at 

global-level, not to classify the interaction of a single establishment with a local population or 

metapopulation.  

In this context, establishing risk criteria for the purposes of a QERA was one of the 

main themes of discussion and decision in a workshop on ecological modeling at Applied 

Biomathematics, Setauket, New York, on August 24-26 of 2011. The author of this work was 

present at this workshop, together with some of the most cited authors in the field of 

ecological modeling. They concluded that it may be more appropriate to express risk criteria 

in terms of “half loss” (i.e. 50% population abundance decline) instead of total extinction. As 

a result, they proposed the following risk categories for the purposes of a QERA: 

Table 3 - Categories for assessing risks of each accidental scenario in a QERA. 

Category Risk of half loss Years 

Critically Endangered &gt; 50% 10 

Endangered &gt; 20% 20 

Vulnerable &gt; 10% 100 

Low risk &gt; 0.1% 100 

Negligible &gt; 0.001% 100 

Background risk &amp;lt;0.001% 100 

 

 

2.5.8 Case studies 

This section is especially concerned with a bibliographic review of published 

applications of ecological modeling in risk assessment. For instance, Naito et al. applies an 

ecosystem model for ERA of chemicals in a Japanese lake [67]; Pauwels presents a case study 

to show how risks to a brook trout (Salvelinus frontinalis) population exposed continually to a 

contaminant (in this case the pesticide toxaphene) can be assessed and quantified using 

ecological modeling, as well as describes the data needed to parameterize a fish population 

model [31]; Bartell et al. presents an aquatic ecosystem model for estimating ecological risks 

posed by toxic chemicals in rivers, lakes, and reservoirs in Québec, Canada [68]; finally, 

Chen uses an aquatic ecological risk assessment model to analyze exposure and ecological 

effects and to estimate community-level risks to fish, aquatic insects and benthic 



39 

 

macroinvertebrates in Keelung River in northern Taiwan, associated with chemicals of 

potential concern such as ammonia, copper and zinc [69].  

All those works were very useful as a basis of knowledge on ecological and toxicity 

extrapolation models. It is worth noting, however, that none of them are within the context of 

industrial accidents, as we aim to do in this work. 

In addition, there are several other works on using ecological models not specifically in 

risk assessment related to chemical exposure, but manly in species conservation and 

management (see reference [70]). They are also very useful though, since they contain 

demonstrations of how an ecological model is implemented. Such reference was essential as 

guidance on the application example of this work, because it contains a collection of case 

studies of models applied to a variety of species (including fishes) and implemented in the 

population modeling and viability analysis software RAMAS GIS 4.0, which is an older but 

similar version to the same software that will be used in the application example of this work 

[34].

3 PROPOSED METHODOLOGY 

The proposed QRA methodology is directed to industrial accidents with potential to 

cause ecological adverse effects. The methodology considers both the accident’s frequency of 

occurrence and the magnitude of the adverse ecological effects, so that it is capable of 

quantifying ecological risks caused by events with low frequency of occurrence and 

catastrophic consequences. It is not restricted to assess ecological risks via individual-level 

endpoints that often leads to inaccurate risk estimates. It is also able to predict the responses 

of populations to toxic exposure (via population-level endpoints), taking into account the 

relationships between individuals, the life history and ecology of a species. This way, the 

methodology can assess the risk of a population extinction (or decline) in the future under the 

conditions that catastrophic accidents might happen. The proposed methodology is applicable 

only for ecological risks caused by toxic substances. It is not able to assess ecological risks of 

fire or explosion caused by accidents with substances that are solely flammable. 

There are similarities between the methodology and the basic guidelines for preparation 

of studies in risk assessment provided by CETESB in the reference [50], which is applicable 

to the assessment of industrial accidents with potential to cause damage to humans outside the 

establishment (i.e. harm to people in surrounding areas, located beyond the establishment 

boundaries). The main similarities are in the qualitative risk assessment step that involves the 

consolidation of accidental scenarios via techniques such as Preliminary Risk Analysis 

(PRA); and in the risk quantification expressed as a FN curve, which is similar to the FN 

curve to quantify social risks used by CETESB. By contrast, the main difference is that the 

methodology seeks to assess ecological risks only, whereas CETESB focus on human risk 

assessment. 

The steps of the proposed methodology are as follows (shown in Figure 3.1). 

1. Problem characterization; 

2. Identification of hazards and consolidation of accidental scenarios; 

3. Exposure assessment 

4. Frequency estimates; 

5. Population modeling; 

6. Risk quantification and evaluation. 

 

The methodology is interactive, so that revaluation may occur during any part of the 

assessment, although deficiencies that must be revaluated may jeopardize resources available 



41 

 

to complete the QERA (e.g. time and money). The methodology uses objective criteria 

throughout the second, third and fourth steps in order to rule out accidental scenarios that will 

not significantly contribute to the final ecological risk, avoiding waste of resources. 

 

 

Figure 3.1 – Steps in conducting the methodology to Quantitative Ecological Risk Assessment 
for industrial accidents. 

In the next sections, the aforementioned steps are discussed. 

3.1 Problem characterization 

The first step is a planning phase on which the entire risk assessment depends. It 

requires engagement between the risk assessor and others experts such as: risk managers, 

environmental managers, ecologists, technical managers, operators and others interested 



42 

 

parties when appropriate (e.g. industrial leaders, government, environmental groups, any 

segment of society concerned about ecological risks).  

They should be able to (1) define risk assessment issues and objectives, (2) characterize 

the establishment and installations (e.g. storage tanks, transport units, pipelines, loading 

equipment) to be included in the QERA and (3) characterize ecological components (habitats, 

species, life stages) in the region. Information to answer many of these issues may already be 

available from other studies such as an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) or even from 

a human QRA. 

3.1.1 Risk assessment issues and objectives 

The risk assessor should ensure that the results of the risk assessment will meet the 

needs of risk managers, i.e. how will risk assessment help the process of risk management. 

This way, they should reach a general agreement on characteristics such as: 

• Nature of the problem (e.g. licensing process, company’s own initiative, 

providing guidance, legal mandates). 

• Objectives for the QERA, including criteria for success. 

• Scale of the assessment (e.g. small area evaluated in depth or large area in less 

detail). 

• General spatial (e.g. local, regional, or national) and temporal (i.e. the time 

frame over which effects will be evaluated) boundaries of the problem. 

• Expected outputs of the QERA and the resources available to complete it (e.g. 

personnel, time, money). 

• Policy considerations (corporate policy, societal concerns, environmental laws). 

• Data and information already available. When data are few, further field work is 

needed to collected more data and that requires more resources for the 

assessment. When more resources are not available and new data cannot be 

collected, it may be possible to extrapolate from existing data. In this case, the 

risk assessor and risk managers must reach an agreement about what is known 

and what will be extrapolated from what is known. 

• Acceptable level of uncertainty. If after the end of the QERA, the output does 

not meet the acceptable level of uncertainty, investment of new resources may 

be requested in order to develop ways of reducing uncertainty. The obvious way 

to reduce uncertainty is further field work to collect more data, so that additional 



43 

 

resources will be necessary. This way, the acceptable level of uncertainty should 

comply with the resources available to complete the assessment. 

• Ecological impacts caused by past accidents. 

3.1.2 Characteristics of the establishment 

Here the risk assessor should collect technical information that characterize the 

establishment with regard to its physical structure, process conditions, chemicals of potential 

concern and installations (e.g. storage tanks, transport units, pipelines, loading equipment) in 

the establishment that deals with those chemicals. 

Some installations may not significantly contribute to the risk because they do not deal 

with a considerable amount of hazardous chemical; therefore it is not worth considering all 

installations in the QERA. It is the responsibility of the risk assessor to select installations to 

be included in the QERA, under consultation of competent professionals and experts. The 

Committee for the Prevention of Disasters provides a selection method to determine which 

installations should be considered in a human QRA, provided in the second chapter of the 

reference [18]. This recommends a selection method of installations with potential to cause 

ecological damage, because this method is not dependent on consequences to humans, but on 

the amount of substance present in the installations and on the process conditions. 

More specifically, the risk assessor should, if possible, gather relevant information 

about: 

• Location of the establishment. 

• Layout of the establishment, pointing the hazardous installations to be included 

in the QERA. If transport units are included as dangerous installations, the 

transport route should be specified. 

• Updated plants or aerial photographs showing ecological environments near 

dangerous installations. 

• Chemicals of potential concern identified by the official nomenclature, 

including: amount; ways of processing, handling, transport and storage; 

physicochemical properties. Raw materials, intermediate and finished products, 

byproducts, residues and wastes should also be considered. 

• Description of processes in each hazardous installation and operational routines. 

If possible, besides a written description, it should include drawings, diagrams 

and flowcharts. 



44 

 

• Operational data (e.g. flow, pressure, temperature) on the processes with 

chemicals of potential concern. 

• Protection and safety systems. 

3.1.3 Characteristics of the ecological components 

The purpose here is to gather information about ecological features in the environment 

possibly affected by accidents in the establishment. Hence, consultants such as environmental 

managers and ecologists may help the risk assessor out here, who should determine 

characteristics such as: 

• Location of ecosystems possibly affected by accidents in the establishment. 

• Area (spatial boundaries) of ecosystems to be evaluated, highlighting zones of 

permanent preservation. 

• Ecological receptors (plants and animals) in the area, highlighting key species, 

e.g.: indicator species that are thought to be more sensitive and therefore serve 

as an early warning indicator of ecological effects; species of scientific and 

economic importance; rare and endangered species; or any species to be 

protected. For aquatic environments, indicator species are usually fishes, 

invertebrates or green algae. For sediment and soils, they are terrestrial plants, 

sediment dwelling organisms or earthworms. For air1, representative species are 

typically birds. 

• Geographic location and boundaries of populations or metapopulations of key 

species to be evaluated. 

o Geographic distribution of local populations within the metapopulation 

(when appropriate). 

• Gather relevant information about the biology of key species. 

• Define assessment endpoints that can effectively provide information about the 

population of key species of concern. Population-level endpoints are usually 

abundance, population growth rate, age/size structure, and spatial distribution 

[3]. For the purposes of this methodology, at least the population abundance 

must be considered. 

                                                 
1For these types of ecosystems, the toxic concentration in air is usually so low that sophisticated risk 

assessments are not worthwhile. 

 



45 

 

• Define the life stages of the species of concern and the points at which chemicals 

may affect an individual [3]. 

• Physical stressors (e.g. hunting, fishing, boat traffic, thermal effluents, extreme 

weather changes) already affecting the key species. 

• Chemical stressors already affecting the key species. 

It is important to stress that risk will be quantified via population models that describe 

the population dynamic of key species chosen here. Consequently, the process of choosing 

key species should be carefully conducted by the risk assessor and consultants, because it will 

have a great influence on the results of the QERA. Populations or metapopulations of key 

species should be strategically chosen in a way that at least: they are representative in the 

ecosystem possibly affected; there is enough geographic and demographic data on the 

population to build a population model; and there is enough ecotoxicological data on the key 

species of concern (or on related species). 

When possible, one should build a visual representation of the relationships among 

representative biotic groups of ecological receptors in order to illustrate the flows of energy, 

carbon, or contaminants. For example, a food web relationships among representative biotic 

groups within a ecosystem is useful to illustrate the key species’ position in the food web, 

which helps to qualitatively understand the ecological adverse effects at higher levels than 

population-level (i.e. community- and ecosystem-level). 

Most information gathered in this phase will be necessary to guide the mathematical 

representation of the population dynamics, in the sixth step of the methodology. 

3.2 Identification of hazards and consolidation of accidental scenarios 

This step is similar to the second step of the basic guidelines for human QRA provided 

by CETESB in the reference [50]. The difference is that here the focus is only on the 

identification of accidents that may cause damage to the ecological environment. 

This is a qualitative step of a risk assessment which aims at identifying all the initiator 

events of accidents and its possible consequences, i.e. to consolidate accidental scenarios. 

Structured techniques are applied in order to (1) systematically consolidate all accidental 

scenarios, to (2) qualitatively rank the risks related to each accidental scenario according to 

their frequency and severity, and to (3) select those accidental scenarios that should be 

subjected to a more detailed risk assessment (i.e. quantitative assessment) in the next steps.  



46 

 

The methodology makes use of the technique named Preliminary Hazard Analysis 

(PHA) to perform this step, although other techniques such as Hazard and Operability 

Analysis (HazOp), “What If?”, Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA), among others, 

may be used when the risk assessor finds it is suitable for the installation being studied. More 

information about PHA and other hazard analysis techniques is provided in the reference [71]. 

A worksheet is generally used to report the qualitative information that consolidate each 

accidental scenario, such as: hazard, initiator event (what, where, when), causes, control 

measures, possible consequences to the ecological environment, as well as frequency and 

severity classes. A typical PHA worksheet is presented in Table 4.

Below is the description of information to be filled according to the PHA worksheet 

above: 

• Identified hazards: hazards with potential to cause damage to the ecological 

environment. At best, it should contain the identification of the substance (CAS 

number), its temperature, pressure and flow rate. 

• Probable causes: description of the causes that may lead to the identified hazard 

(i.e. initiator events), such as cracking or breaking certain pipeline or equipment. 

• Possible effects: possible physical effects from the event (e.g. contamination of 

the beach nearby, death of fishes, decrease fecundity of fishes, restrict 

photosynthesis of marine plants, reduce the abundance of affected populations). 

• Control measures: barriers and preventive actions which could avoid the 

occurrence of the initiator event. 

• Frequency class: classification of the event on its frequency, according to Table 

5. 

• Severity class: classification of the event on its severity, according to Table 6. 



47 

 

• Risk rank: qualitative value to the risk level of each accidental scenario, which is 

a result of crossing the classes of frequency and severity, as illustrated in the 

Table 7. The risk is classified as Acceptable (A), Moderate (M) or Not 

Acceptable (NA). For acceptable risks, there is no need for additional measures, 

i.e., monitoring is necessary and sufficient to ensure that the control and 

recovery measures are maintained. To risks qualified as moderate, additional 

control and recovery measures should be evaluated, aiming at risks reduction. 

The classification as not acceptable risks is an indication that existing control 

and recovery measures are insufficient. Alternative methods should be 

considered for reducing the likelihood of occurrence and magnitude of 

consequences. 

• Recommendations and observations: recommendations for control and recovery 

measures that should be taken to decrease the frequency and/or severity of the 

accidental scenario. 

• Accidental scenario: Identification number to the accidental scenario.

Table 7 - Risk ranking: Acceptable (A), Moderate (M) or Not Acceptable (NA). 

 

After all accidental scenarios have been identified, one should select the most relevant 

to a more detailed assessment. Therefore, one should clearly establish the criterion considered 

in the selection of the relevant accidental scenarios. For a conservative approach, one can use 

a criterion based only on the severity class. Therefore, in this work, it is adopted the criterion 

of severity III or IV to trigger accidental scenarios for further analysis in the next step [50]. 

Because PHA is often used as an initial risk study in an early stage of a project, the 

results of this step may be already available. In fact, in a human QRA, accidents with 

potential to cause damage to humans are identified and they usually have potential to cause 

ecological damage as well. In this case, most accidents have been already identified and the 

risk assessor should just review the ecological effects (i.e. possible consequences) caused by 

these accidents. Conversely, if a previous PHA was not conducted yet, this is a great 

opportunity to do it. Likewise, this PHA might be used in a human QRA. 

At the end of this step one should have a set of accidental scenarios characterized by 

qualitative information as in Table 4. As already mentioned, all accidental scenarios classified 

with severity III or IV should be selected for further analysis in the next step. In addition, this 

step allows to systematically identify the existing accidents and their possible ecological 

damage, leading to an improved level of preparation to emergencies. 

3.3 Exposure assessment 

This step should be conducted for all accidental scenarios selected in the previous step 

to a further and more detailed assessment. Firstly, it consists of applying mathematical models 

that simulate the occurrence and movement of toxic releases in the water, atmosphere and 

soil. 

More specifically, one must estimate exposure of key species to the chemical released, 

for each accidental scenario. This includes describing the chemical dispersion and predicting 

the concentration that reaches key species of concern in each instant of time, i.e. 

concentrations Ci(x,y,z,t) within a defined area (spatial boundaries), for each accidental 

scenario, i. Chemical fate and transport models have been often used to describe and predict

distribution and concentration of chemicals in the environment. Guidance on fate and 

transport models is beyond the scope of this work; one suggests the references [73; 74] for 

additional information. 

For most accidental scenarios, meteorological conditions may influence the chemical 

dispersion and, consequently, the estimated exposure concentration. In such cases, it is 

necessary to generate a set of meteorological scenarios for each accidental scenario, i. Thus, if 

one has x accidental scenarios selected from the second step and y meteorological scenarios 

defined here, one has now yx ×  new accidental scenarios, each one with a specific function 

of exposure concentrations Ci(x,y,z,t). In other words, each meteorological scenario defined in 

this step within each accidental scenario from the previous step will have a specific function 

of predicted chemical concentration that vary in time and space. 

A meteorological scenario is defined by meteorological parameters that depend on the 

kind of environmental media (e.g. air, soil, water) the chemical moves through. Such 

meteorological parameters could be, e.g., weather stability class; wind direction and speed; 

air, soil/bund, water temperature; ambient pressure; humidity; tides of the sea; currents of the 

ocean; season of the year; etc. To do not yield an exaggerated number of new accidental 

scenarios for the QERA, it is useful to group the data in a limited number of representative 

meteorological parameters. 

Subsequently, because the next steps of the methodology do require additional costs and 

special expertise, one should decide whether the chemical concentration estimated is expected 

to cause ecological adverse effects, for all accidental scenarios. In other words, one should 

select the accidental scenarios in which population-level effects are likely to occur, so that 

population-level ecological risks should be quantified. This way, the methodology needs a 

criterion to trigger accidental scenarios for further QERA. The hazard quotient (i.e. an 

exposure concentration divided by an effects concentration) is a commonly applied criterion 

for that [2; 75]. They are quick and simple to use and do not require special expertise from 

risk assessors.  

In this sense, Pastorok et al. [3] states that “at best, deterministic hazard quotients […] 

can only be used to screen out chemicals, receptors, or site areas that are clearly not a problem 

(when the hazard quotient is considerably less than 1)”. In addition to that, EurEco found in 

recent study that most of the chemicals, pesticides and marine schemes developed for ERA, 

use the hazard quotient, calculated as the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) 

divided by the Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC), to indicate low risk when it is less 



50 

 

than 0.01 [75]. For a conservative approach in the proposed methodology, the PEC will be the 

local maximum2 of Ci(x,y,z,t), whereas PNEC is the concentration below which exposure to a 

substance is not expected to cause adverse effects on an individual organism. The former is 

provided by the results of chemical fate and trasnport models and the latter by ecotoxicologial 

data on the species being assessed, usually as a concentration based endpoint known as No 

Observed Effect Level (NOEL - see glossary for details). The ECOTOX database can be used 

as a source for locating single chemical toxicity data for plants and animals [76]. It is 

important to note that the PNEC is an individual-level endpoint and so is the hazard quotient. 

As a result, the proposed methodology uses the criterion PEC/PNEC &gt; 0.01 to pick 

accidentals scenarios to the next step. Because it is a very conservative approach, it is likely 

that no accidental scenarios that considerably contribute to the ecological risk will be ruled 

out. Nonetheless, if it concerns the risk assessor, he might evaluate other chemical aspects 

such as: persistence and biodegradability; bioaccumulative potential (via bioaccumulation 

factor); and solubility in water (in case of an aquatic ecosystem). For example, if the chemical 

is readily degradable, population-level effects are not likely to occur, even if PEC/PNEC is 

greater than 0.01. 

Finally, at the end of this step one should have a set of accidental scenarios that are 

likely to contribute to cause population-level effects. Several parameters consolidate each 

accidental scenario, they are mainly: hazard, initiator event, causes, control measures, 

meteorological parameters, chemical concentration Ci(x,y,z,t), and hazard quotient. 

3.4 Frequency estimates 

For the selected accidental scenarios in the previous step, the frequency of occurrence 

should be estimated. The output of the QERA is very dependent on this estimate, so that an 

under- or sub-estimate of this value can lead to rough errors in calculating the ecological risk. 

In some risk assessments, the frequency of occurrence of an accident can be estimated 

from historical records contained in databases or references, since they are actually 

representative to the case. Generic frequencies and times are presented in the reference [18]. 

In the third chapter of this reference, Loss of Containment Events (LOCs) (caused by e.g., 

corrosion, construction errors, welding failures, blocking of tanking vents, mechanical impact, 

natural causes, domino effects, etc.) are described and their generic frequencies of occurrence 

are estimated, for various systems in an establishment, including stationary installations and 

                                                 
2 By local we mean that it is within the spatial boundaries of populations being evaluated as well as within the 
simulated time period. 



51 

 

transport units such as: pressurized stationary tanks and vessels, atmospheric stationary tanks 

and vessels, gas cylinders, pipes, pumps, heat exchangers, pressure relief devices, 

warehouses, storage of explosives, road tankers, tank wagons, and ships. 

However, those generic frequencies describe average situations and may need 

corrections concerning specific circumstances of the installation under assessment. Due to the 

complexity of some installations, it might be necessary to use expert opinion and Reliability 

Engineering techniques (e.g., event tree, Event Sequence Diagrams, Bayesian Belief 

Networks) in order to correct the generic frequencies taking into account the influence of 

control measures (e.g., safety management systems, alarms, automatic stops), as well as 

human errors that might contribute to the occurrence of the accidental scenario. In other 

words, the risk assessment team might need to conduct a reliability analysis involving generic 

equipment failures, control measures and human error. It is beyond the scope of this work to 

provide guidance on reliability analysis; for a general view on reliability theory, models, 

methods and applications, see the references [41; 42; 43; 77]; and for specific information 

about techniques such as Event Sequence Diagrams (ESD), Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN) 

and Human Reliability Analysis see the references [44; 45; 46; 47; 48; 49]. 

In addition to that, for each accidental scenario the frequencies concerning 

meteorological parameters that consolidate each accidental scenario (defined in the previous 

step) should be also taken into account. Consequently, meteorological statistics (deduced, for 

example, from a nearby and representative meteorological station) should be used to define 

fractional frequencies or number of observations to each meteorological scenario. 

Finally, only accidental scenarios that contribute significantly to the ecological risk 

should be included in the QERA under the conditions that (1) the frequency of occurrence is 

equal to or greater than 10-8 per year and (2) PEC/PNEC is greater than 0.01. The criteria 

therefore are used to trigger accidental scenarios for risk quantification and evaluation via 

population modeling in the next step. The first criterion is taken from reference [18], where it 

is stated that “a threshold of 10-8 per year as criterion for including LOCs is considered 

reasonable since generic LOCs leading to the release of the complete inventory have failure 

frequencies in the range 10-5 and 10-7 per year”. The second criterion is taken from the 

previous step of the proposed methodology and was already explained. 

The output of this step is then a set of accidental scenarios that are likely to contribute to 

the ecological risk, with their respective frequency estimates of occurrence. Several 

parameters consolidate each accidental scenario, they are mainly: hazard, initiator event, 



52 

 

causes, control measures, meteorological parameters, chemical concentration Ci(x,y,z,t), 

hazard quotient, and frequency estimate of occurrence (that is equal or greater than 10-8 per 

year). 

3.5 Population modeling 

This step is an iterative process (see Figure 3.2). Firstly, a population model is 

formulated (see section 2.5) in an effort to describe the natural population dynamics of key 

species in the area (without exposure to the chemical of concern). It is necessary to formulate 

a population model to each key species, if more than one is being analyzed. The population 

dynamics must be described via assessment endpoints defined in the first step. The predicted 

chemical concentration, Ci(x,y,z,t) - for each accidental scenario, i, that may affect a 

population of concern - will be used as input variable to describe the population dynamics 

with chemical exposure. 



53 

 

 

Figure 3.2 - Iterative process of population modeling. 

 

Pastorok et al. [3] provides a detailed guidance on ecological modeling in risk 

assessment. He also makes a critical evaluation of software designed for a QERA, pointing 

their possible uses and limitations. 

Input data will be necessary to parameterize the population model. The quality and 

predictiveness of the model depends mostly on the quality and quantity of these data. If data 

for the key species are insufficient, then one could extrapolate the information from related 

species.  



54 

 

Typically, a population model requires information on the following input variables [3; 

31]: age/size structure; specific survival and fecundity rates for each age/size; rates of 

immigration or emigration; initial abundance for each age/size; estimates of variability for the 

vital rates and initial abundances; density dependence effects; geographic and habitat 

distribution of key species; and foraging behavior. The required level of detail for a particular 

variable depends on the assessment objectives. 

Once the population model is formulated, it should be validated in order to make sure 

that the model is a good approximation of reality and provides reliable predictions. The 

validation of a model is typically done by measuring the conformance of predictions with 

empirical data. This measure may be used to characterize the reliability of other predictions. 

It is still a limitation of this methodology to provide an effective method for validation. 

However, there is some ways to validate a model. For example, if there is hardly no 

chemical/physical stressors currently affecting the population, there is a very simple way to 

validate the model: to run the population model multiple times for a non-impact scenario and 

assess its predictions. For non-impact scenarios, it is expected that the population abundance 

will remain steady (for short and middle-term predictions) or will decrease very slightly (for 

long-term predictions, because it is expected that every species goes naturally extinct, 

although it takes thousands of years). This way, if the population model considers no physical 

and chemical stressors, and the predictions show either high risk of extinction or high risk of 

explosion, the model may be not correct and should be reviewed. 

After validation of the model, an uncertainty analysis of risk estimates should be 

conducted in order to determine if the level of uncertainty is acceptable. A simple way to deal 

with uncertainties is to use them to derive worst and best case estimates of extinction risks, 

based on changes on parameters. Such procedure will let the risk assessor to estimate a range 

(upper and lower bounds) to risk measures, such as time to extinction, or risk of decline. The 

greater are the uncertainties in parameter values, the wider will these bounds be. If these 

bounds are too wide, uncertainty may be unacceptable and do not meet the needs of risk 

managers. At best, these bounds should be narrow enough to make decisions taken by risk 

managers based on the lower bound the same as those based on the upper bound (i.e. the 

difference between the lower and upper bound should be regardless for risk managers). 

It is important to stress that there are several other ways to measure and communicate 

uncertainty. To study them and provide an effective method to evaluate uncertainty is 

proposal for future developments in this methodology. 



55 

 

If the model is appropriate to describe the population dynamics of concern, uncertainties 

about risk estimates are mostly because of uncertainties about parameters (e.g., survival rate, 

fecundity rate, carrying capacity, initial population abundance), what is originated from 

incomplete knowledge, limited sample size, measurement error and use of surrogate data. 

More precise estimates for parameters can improve the model by narrowing the ranges of risk 

measures. This requires further field work and data gathering, what costs resources such as 

equipment, technology, staff, time, etc.  

Obviously, resources are limited, so its allocation should be optimized in a way that 

uncertainty is reduced the most. With this in mind, a systematic sensitivity analysis can point 

out to the most important parameters to allocate resources for further data gathering. This can 

be done by observing the effects of changes in any model parameter on population extinction 

risk. 

In summary, if uncertainty is acceptable, then it is the end of this step. Otherwise, if the 

present model provides risk estimates with an unacceptable level of uncertainty, then a 

sensitivity analysis can point out to the most important parameters which need better 

estimates. Then, further field work and data gathering on these parameters can improve the 

model. Finally, one has an improved model (with a validated structure and more precise 

parameters) which must be further analyzed until it is validated and uncertainties are 

acceptable. 

3.6 Risk quantification and evaluation 

The output elements from the previous steps are necessary as input for this step, 

essentially: 

• a population model for each key species; 

• a predicted concentration Ci(x,y,z,t) within the area of concern for each 

accidental scenario, i; t in the same unit as the time-step of the model; 

• the frequency estimate of each accidental scenario per time-step of the model; 

General temporal boundaries were determined in the first step. The risk assessor should 

now define specific temporal boundaries for each accidental scenarios, i.e. the expected time 

frame over which the accidental scenario causes ecological effects, which depends basically 

on the concentration Ci(t) within the area and on remedial actions to remove chemical from 

the area. This will also become an input variable (i.e. the time of the simulation). 



56 

 

Subsequently, an exposure-response assessment should be conducted in order to 

describe the relationship between the concentration, C(x,y,z,t), of the chemical and the 

magnitude of the individual-level responses of key species (represented by changes in 

measurement endpoints, e.g., survival rate, fecundity rate, carrying capacity). It will be 

usually necessary to specify a dose-response function, which can be built from data on long-

term effects of the chemical on key species. These are ecotoxicological data at individual-

level that basically look at the effects of life-cycle chemical exposure on input variables such 

as age-specific fecundity, survival and mortality. Because this is a major step in the ecological 

risk assessment, this topic is not addressed in the reference [3]. Instead, they suggest the 

references [1; 56; 58] as considerable guidance on how to analyze for toxicity and exposure-

response relationships. 

By linking exposure-response relationships to the population model, one can now 

predict how different concentrations of the chemical (note that for each accidental scenario 

there is a predicted chemical concentration) would cause adverse effects on populations of 

key species. 

The probability of adverse effects may be represented by probability-consequence 

curves. For example, Figure 3.3 shows the consequences over time on population abundance 

for three different scenarios of chemical exposure. The several ways of expressing those 

curves were presented in section 2.5.4 and the two ways of assessing impacts and risks of 

each accidental scenario were described in section 2.5.5. The risks should also be categorized 

according to section 2.5.7. Lastly, a sensitivity analysis may add insight to the QERA by 

exploring the sensitivity to assumptions. 



57 

 

 

Figure 3.3 – Illustrative example of effects on a fish population for a 100 years simulation, for 
three different concentrations of oil exposure. Scenarios 1, 2 and 3, respectively: C(x,y,z,t) &amp;lt;1 ml/L; 

C(x,y,z,t) = 16 ml/L; C(x,y,z,t) = 30 ml/L. 

To quantify the ecological risks of all accidental scenarios in only one measure, the 

values of the consequence estimates should be combined with cumulative frequency estimate 

of occurrence. This regard was introduced in section 2.5.6. As a result, one builds a FN curve, 

where N is the average population decline number and F the cumulative frequency of 

accidents with N or greater abundance decline. For that, the following steps should be 

conducted: 

a. Select a key species, s. 

b. Set the average population abundance decline at the end of the simulation, siN , 

for each accidental scenario, i, for each key species, s.  

c. Build a list of average abundance decline, siN , and its respective frequency 

estimate of occurrence, )( 1?yFsi . It is necessary a list for each key species. 

d. The FN curve is now constructed by cumulating all frequencies in each list (i.e. 

for each key species) for which siN  is greater than or equal to N:

The Figure 3.4 shows an example of an FN curve that characterizes the ecological risks 

originating from accidents in an establishment. 



58 

 

 

Figure 3.4 - FN curve for representation of the ecological risks related to accidents in an 
establishment (figure for demonstration purposes only). 

Together, the risk curves (for each particular accidental scenario) and the FN curve can 

be used in making conservation decisions that involve planning future fieldwork, assessing 

impacts and evaluating management actions. For all these cases, the objective of the decision 

must be specified. It is assumed that the objective is minimizing the risk. Then a cost-benefit 

analysis can be made with the results of a series of assessments. The cost is actually the 

implementation cost of alternatives to reduce risk, and the benefit is the quantified risk 

reduction itself. Consequently, the selection criterion for the best alternative can be based on 

minimizing the cost:benefit ratio while satisfying either a cost or a risk constraint. 

To sum up, the results of the methodology can support decisions such as for example: 

• if we invest a certain quantity of money (say U$100,000) in control measures, 

what will be the frequency reduction in the FN curve? 

• How best to allocate this U$100,000 in order to maximize risk reduction? Which 

accidental scenarios prioritize? 

• If we change the layout of the establishment, setting hazardous installations 

more distant from ecological environments, what will be the new FN curve? 

• What are the best conservation options (e.g., re-routing of spills, pollution 

remediation, habitat protection, translocation or reintroduction of individuals in 

the population)? 



59 

 

• To which value an accident’s frequency of occurrence must be reduced in order 

to achieve a risk level of acceptability? 

The last question is particularly dependent on risk criteria for acceptability. In fact, after 

quantification of the risks to populations, they can be evaluated by stakeholders (enterprise 

leaders, government, environmental agencies, etc.) to determine whether the risks are 

acceptable or not. However, establishing risk criteria for acceptability is a slow and 

complicated process that requires the participation of society in its judgment. Once completed 

the process, there is now a standard, i.e. a value or interval where the risk is considered 

acceptable. It makes law clearer, so that less money is spent with lawyers and so more money 

can be spent with environmental and conservation management. 

Some scientists believe that the interpretation of the results of a QERA is a political 

process that requires criteria imposed by the society rather than by the scientific community 

alone. Others believe that scientists nevertheless have a responsibility to provide guidance 

[35]. It is not an aim of this work to provide guidance on risk criteria for acceptability. 

Although it was proposed risk categories for assessing a particular accidental scenario in 

terms of probability and time to half loss (see section 2.5.7), this work does not devise risk 

categories in the FN curve that cumulates risks of all accidental scenarios. 

Determining risk categories in the FN curve is still a shortcoming of the proposed 

methodology. With this in mind, the FN curve makes the process of devising risk categories 

for acceptability less difficult, because it is expressed in the same way as the societal risk in 

human QRA. For example, one should determine what is the acceptable frequency of a 

population declining by a given percentage (say 20%), or the acceptable frequency of a 

population extinction. And that is much more general than, for example, determining risk 

categories for the volume of contaminated water, as in PROTEUS model [19], because each 

specific ecosystem has its specific responses caused by exposure to a given volume of 

contaminated surface water, so that risk categorization relies on a subjective evaluation of 

ecologists.

4 APPLICATION EXAMPLE 

In the Brazilian industrial current scenario, the Suape Port and Industrial Complex 

(SPIC), located in the state of Pernambuco, detaches itself by being the most complete 

shipping hub in the Northeast Region of Brazil for the location of port and industrial business. 

With a complete infrastructure to fulfill the needs of the most diverse enterprises, Suape has 

attracted an increasing number of companies that are interested in either placing their products 

in the regional market or exporting to other countries [78]. 

The SPIC can be considered as the largest center of investments in Brazil. Today, the 

sum of investments is about U$ 21.3 billion, spent by more than 100 active enterprises and 

other 35 in their implementation phase. An oil refinery, three petrochemical plants and two 

shipyards are in construction there. The attraction of such an amount of investment is mainly 

due to the privileged geographical location of the state of Pernambuco, allowing the transport 

of products from/to more than 160 ports worldwide. Furthermore, it has been seen a great 

investment on research by universities in the region, with the purpose of developing and 

improving the production and operation in SPIC. [78] 

With an investment of about U$ 4 billion, the Abreu e Lima oil refinery (RNEST) is the 

biggest establishment in the industrial complex, still in implementation phase. In fact, the 

company Petrobras (Brazilian multinational energy company and the largest company in Latin 

America) has decided to build 3 refineries in the Northeast region of Brazil, for its closer 

distance to consumer markets such as Europe and the USA. 

The refinery RNEST has a project that predicts a processing of 200 thousand barrels of 

heavy oil per day, according to API (American Petroleum Institute) classification, and aims 

the maximal production of diesel. The processed oil will come from the Campos Basin in Rio 

de Janeiro, Brazil, and from Orinoco, Venezuela [79]; which will supply RNEST through an 

external harbor in SPIC that is expected to receive oil tankers up to 170,000 DWT 

(Deadweight Tons). Considering the great amount of oil transported to RNEST, accidents 

with potential to cause serious damage to the ecological environment might happen. For 

example, a marine spill of a great volume of oil, forming a plume of hydrocarbons that 

spreads out into a very thin layer across the surface of the water and may come ashore, 

damaging the ecological environment in the coast of Pernambuco. 

The coastline of the state of Pernambuco has a very rich ecological environment, 

composed by ecosystems such as beaches, estuaries, mangroves, coral reefs, coastal islands, 

resting and atlantic forests, each of them interacting with one or more. Moreover, several 



61 

 

species are important to the economy of the state as well as for feeding of local population. 

Hence, any exposure to toxic substances may cause significant consequences. 

This section aims at testing the capability of the proposed methodology to quantify 

ecological risks, as well as its feasibility in terms of data and resource needs. This is achieved 

by performing a QERA via the proposed methodology in the activities of oil handling and 

transport to RNEST at the external harbor. 

Several sources of information were used to perform this QERA: 

• Environmental Impact Statement of the establishment and associated documents 

[79; 80; 81]; 

• Ecotoxicological database [76]; 

• Comprehensive database of information about fish species [82]; 

• Case studies on population modeling [70]; 

• Published articles about the key species chosen and related species [83; 84]. 

• Demographic data about fish populations on the coastline of Pernambuco, 

provided by the Tropical Fish Ecology Lab of the University of Pernambuco 

(UPE); 

• Results of a fate and transport model designed to predict the oil dispersion in the 

ocean after several accidentals scenarios of spill, provided by the Center for 

Studies and Essays in Risk and Environmental Modeling (CEERMA) of the 

Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE); 

• Personal communication 

o with ecologists of the Tropical Fish Ecology Lab of the University of 

Pernambuco (UPE); 

o with chemical engineers from CEERMA (Centro de Estudos em Risco e 

Modelagem Ambiental) of the Federal University of Pernambuco 

(UFPE). 

4.1 Problem Characterization 

Figure 4.1 illustrates the steps in conducting this methodology and detaches the current 

step. 



62 

 

 

Figure 4.1 - Step 1 within the flowchart of the methodology. 

The problem consists of quantifying ecological risks originating from accidents 

associated with transport and handling of crude oil that supplies RNEST, which is to be 

constructed within the SPIC, in Ipojuca, Pernambuco, Brazil. 

4.1.1 Risk assessment issues and objectives 

• Objectives of the QERA: this assessment aims at providing risk managers 

objective answers about the ecological risks associated with transport and handling 

of crude oil to supply the oil refinery RNEST. To ensure that the results of this 

assessment would meet the needs of risk managers, the following specific 

objectives were determined: 

o to identify the significant ecological risks; 



63 

 

o to examine the dynamics of an representative species population in the 

surrounding ecosystem; 

o to quantify potential risks of accidental events – originating from ship 

transportation of crude oil that supplies RNEST – to the aquatic ecosystem 

on the coastal region of Suape, PE, Brazil; 

o to be as conservative as possible in parameterization, predicting worst-case 

scenarios; 

o to provide numerical basis of knowledge for communicating risks; 

o to provide a basis for comparing, ranking and prioritizing accidental 

scenarios; 

o to conduct a sensitivity analysis that expresses changes in risks measures as 

a function of changes in the accidents’ frequencies of occurrence; 

o to conduct a sensitivity analysis that express changes in risks measures as a 

function of changes in the magnitude of the consequences; 

o to deal with uncertainty in the results of significant accidental scenarios, 

measuring it by estimating a range (best case and worst case) to risk 

measures; 

o to deal with natural (environmental) variability in time; 

• Scale of the assessment: small area evaluated in depth; 

• General spatial boundaries: local; 

• General temporal boundaries: 100 years; 

• Expected outputs of the QERA:  

o for a non-impact scenario: abundance trajectory summary, risk curves of 

extinction and time to population half loss (i.e. 50% decline); 

o for each accidental scenario: abundance trajectory summary, risk curves of 

extinction, time to population half loss (i.e. 50% decline), and risk 

category; 

o comparison of results between accidental scenarios and a non-impact 

scenario; 

o FN curve for cumulating risks of all accidental scenarios; 

o to point out further work that can effectively improve results. 

• Resources available: 



64 

 

o personnel: a risk assessor (i.e. the author of this work). Additionally, 

support was given by an ecologist, an oceanographer (for fate and transport 

modeling), and a reliability engineer; 

o time: 5 months; 

• Data and information already available: Environmental Impact Statement of the 

establishment and associated documents [79; 80; 81]. 

• Acceptable level of variability in results: variability is considered acceptable as 

long as the width of the 95% confidence interval in the results of the time to “half 

loss” (i.e. 50% population decline) is smaller than 1%. 

• Ecological impacts caused by past accidents: none, the refinary is still in 

implementation phase. 

4.1.2 Characteristics of the establishment 

The refinery RNEST has a project that predicts a processing of 230 thousand barrels of 

heavy oil per day. The crude oil might be 50% Marlin, originating from the Campos Basin in 

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and 50% Mejorado Carabobo, originating from Orinoco, Venezuela 

[79]; or, alternatively, 100% Marlim. 

The refinery will be built in the peripheral industrial zone 3B (3B-ZI) of the CPIS in the 

northeast region of Brazil, 50 kilometers south from the town of Recife, next to latitude 

8º17’S and longitude 35º15’W [80]. It was provided to RNEST an area of 6.3 square

photograph of the CIPS.

The refinery is located about 6 kilometers from the external harbor. This is expected to 

receive oil tankers up to 170,000 DWT (Deadweight Tons) and is surrounded by: to the north, 

the Cocaia island, Tatuoca islands, Tatuoca river, Massangana river, Suape beach and Cape of 

Santo Agostinho; to the south, Gamboa point and Muro Alto beach (Figure 4.3). The refinery 

is then supplied by 8 pipelines connected to the external harbour.

As this QERA is concerned only with accidents associated with transport and handling 

of crude oil for supplying RNEST, no accidental scenarios within RNEST are considered, but 

only transport units (i.e. oil tankers) and their routes to the external harbor. This way, the 

coastal area was divided into 24 quadrants (1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 2A, …, 6D), as in Figure 4.4. 

The central point of each quadrant (1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 2a, …, 6d) represents a specific possible 

location for an accidental oil spill. It is worth stressing that an accidental oil spill in the 

specific point 3a covers not only failures caused by external impact (e.g., collision, stranding) 

but also failures in unloading activities (e.g., full bore rupture of the unloading arm, leak of 

the unloading arm). Conversely, accidental spills in other points cover only external impact, 

since the oil tanker is not docked at the harbor.

The Figure 4.5 presents a side view of an oil tanker. Also, there are some other technical 

information related to the transport of crude oil to the external harbor [78]: 

• transportation ships are double-walled oil tankers, which is compulsory; 

• about 1138 ships come in and out the harbor every year; 

• 24 hours is the average duration of unloading per ship; 

• 144 is the average number of transhipments per year for supplying RNEST;

Finally, crude oil is the only chemical of potential concern in this assessment, also 

named as crude petroleum, petroleum, crankcase oil or petroleum oil, CAS number: 8002059. 

4.1.3 Characteristics of the ecological components 

Among the species in the wild fauna and flora of the coastal region of Suape, it was 

chosen to analyze fishes because [86; 87]: 

1. They have a relatively large size. Although oil causes immediate effects 

throughout the entire spill site, it is the external effects of oil on larger wildlife 

species tha are often immediately apparent. 

2. Life-history information is extensive for most fish species. 

3. Their position at the top of the aquatic food web in relation to invertebrates and 

green algae helps to provide an integrative view of the watershed environment. 

4. Fishes are relatively easy to identify. This tends to decrease data collection 

errors. 

5. Fishes are typically present, even in the most polluted waters. 

After personal communication with professor Simone Ferreira Teixeira from the  

Tropical Fish Ecology Lab of the University of Pernambuco (UPE), it was chosen as indicator 

a local fish population of a native species, i.e. Diapterus rhombeus, order Perciformes, family 

Gerreidae, common name Caitipa mojarra (or Carapeba in Portuguese). Diapterus rhombeus 

(Figure 4.6) is one of the most common Gerreidae species in the estuarine region of Suape, 

Northeastern Brazil. They feed most on small benthic invertebrates and plant materials. These 

fishes are thought to be more sensitive and therefore serve as an early warning indicator of 

ecological impacts. Also, they have significant economic and social importance to the state of 

Pernambuco, since local human communities feed on them as well as sell them as a means of 

livelihood. 



68 

 

 

Figure 4.6 - Photograph of a a Caitipa mojarra. 

The Tropical Fish Ecology Lab of the University of Pernambuco (UPE) provided 

demographic data about those fishes, collected at the mangrove channel of the Tatuoca river 

during 24 consecutive months (from March 2008 until February 2010). Two net catches were 

made each month, i.e. catch 1 (C1) and catch 2 (C2), and the sampler area was 20 m2. Both 

C1 and C2 were made in the same area consecutively without releasing the fishes after the 

first catch, since they aimed at obtaining the abundance on the site and only one catch would 

be less valuable (i.e. those fishes may be schooling and a catch could be sampled over a 

school, overestimating the population abundance). For each catch it was counted the number 

of individuals as well as measured the total length, fork length and standard length (for 

concepts see Fish Measurement in Glossary) of each individual. 

However, there were no available data about the specific geographic location of the fish 

population. Consequently, the geographic location and boundaries of populations were 

estimated via expert opinion only. They say that juveniles use shallow waters of the Suape 

beach and mangrove channels for breeding and for a growth phase, and migrate to areas of 

greater depth as soon as they become adults. Indeed, such opinion was validated by analyzing 

the demographic data discussed in the previous paragraph, i.e. these data were collected in 

shallow waters and only 0,2% of all collect fishes presented a total length greater than 13.4 

centimeters, which is, according to the reference [82], the average length at which a Diapterus 



69 

 

rhombeus juvenile mature for the first time and thus becomes an adult. In summary, only 

0,2% of all collected individuals in shallow waters were adults. 

All this considered, it was determined that the population is located at the Suape beach 

(at the latitude 8º 22’ 18.668’’ S and longitude 34º 57’ 7.160’’ W) within a region of about 

7850 square meters, as illustrated in Figure 4.7. 

 

 

Figure 4.7 - Location of the fish population representing the ecosystem integrity.  

Finally, the chosen assessment endpoint to provide information about the population of 

concern was its abundance. Then, the initial population abundance was estimated at 22,111 

based on population demographic data. 

4.2 Identification of hazards and consolidation of accidental scenarios 

Figure 4.8 illustrates this step within the flowchart of the methodology. 



70 

 

 

Figure 4.8 - Step 2 within the flowchart of the methodology. 

Each point in Figure 4.4 represented a possible location for an oil spill and so 

consolidated an accidental scenario. It was conducted a PHA for each one of the 24 locations 

and only three of them had a severity class III or IV. These were selected for a detailed 

analysis in the next step. More specifically, two scenarios had catastrophic severity class IV 

(i.e. 1a and 2a) and one had critical severity class IV (i.e. 3a), as illustrated in Figure 4.9.  



71 

 

 

Figure 4.9 - Accidental scenarios selected to the next step. 

Once again, accidental events in location 3a cover external impact as well as unloading 

activity. However, it is further from the fish population of concern in comparison with 

locations 2a and 1a. Hence, until this phase of the assessment, it can be qualitatively stated 

that the accidental scenario 3a has a greater frequency of occurrence but smaller severity in 

the consequences; whereas accidental scenarios 2a and 1a have greater severities, because 

they are closer to the fish population, and smaller frequencies, because they cover spills due to 

external impact only. Which of them has higher risks is still unknown. 

4.3 Exposure assessment 

Some meteorological conditions (i.e. topography, tide conditions, and the distribution of 

temperature and salinity of the water) influence the dispersion of oil in the ocean and thus the 

chemical concentration to which the fish population is exposed after an accident. An analysis 

of previous works conducted on the coast of Suape [88; 89; 90] has shown that information on 

the rainy season (from March to August) could be grouped in one meteorological scenario 

named “Winter”. Similarly, data on the spring and summer (from September to February) 



72 

 

were grouped for the numerical representation of the dry scenario named “Summer”. Then, 

for each period of the year two tidal conditions were considered, based on information 

collected by tide gauges installed in the coastal Suape [88; 89; 90]. 

Hence, each of the three accidental scenarios from the previous step was divided into 4 

new scenarios dependent on: the season of the year (summer or winter); the tide of the sea 

(spring tide or neap tide). This way, this step actually evaluates 3 × 4 = 12 accidental 
scenarios. 

4.3.1 Fate and transport modeling 

The Princeton Ocean Model (POM) [91] was used to describe the costal ocean 

circulation in the region of concern. The POM is a three-dimensional, primitive equation, 

time-dependent, \ coordinate, free surface, estuarine and coastal ocean circulation model, 
incorporating a turbulence closure model to provide a realistic parameterization of the vertical 

mixing processes. The computational code of the POM, now in public domain, was developed 

in the 80’s by Blumberg &amp;amp; Mellor [92]. Nowadays, it is one of the most tested and used 

models by the scientific community to this kind of application (e.g., [88; 89; 90; 93; 94; 95]). 

Nonetheless, the original code of the POM model does not contemplate a routine that 

simulates the dispersion of chemical plumes. For this reason, it was added to the 

hydrodynamic POM model a subroutine that calculates the chemical dispersion based on the 

equation of advective-diffusive fate and transport of pollutants developed by the Ocean 

Modeling Laboratory (LABMON) of the University of São Paulo [96]. Therefore, once the 

ocean circulation is established by the POM, a new simulation is ran by injecting a certain 

flow rate of oil at the release point (xr,yr) on the surface of the water. 

The POM is based on the primitive equations of momentum for a Newtonian fluid. It 

basically integrates the Reynolds theorem discretized by finite difference method. The 

prognostic variables are the three components of velocity field, temperature, salinity, and two 

quantities which characterize the turbulence (i.e. the turbulence kinetic energy and the 

turbulence macroscale). A key feature of the POM is the use of the sigma vertical coordinate 

(fraction of the local depth), which allows to consider both the surface and bottom layers of 

the ocean as curved surfaces in the horizontal (Figure 4.10). The sigma coordinate system 

makes the POM appropriate for dealing with significant topographical variability such as that 

encountered in estuaries or over continental shelf breaks and slopes (as is the case of this 

application). 

The sigma coordinate system is based on the transformation: 



73 

 

]? = ];	"? = "; 	\ = `abc?b ; ?? = ?      (4.1) 
where ], ", e are the conventional cartesian coordinates; f ? h + i where h(], ") is 

the bottom topography and i(], ", ?) is the surface elevation. Thus, \ ranges from \ = 0 at 
e ? i to \ ? W1 at e ? h. 

 

Figure 4.10 – The sigma coordinate system in the Princeton Ocean Model. 

In this study, the x-axis is considered perpendicular to the coastline in the northeast 

direction, the y-axis is parallel to the coastline in the northwest direction, and the z-axis is 

perpendicular do the average surface of the ocean. The simulation grid has its origin at the 

point of the coastline situated 2800 meters south of the external harbor (Figure 4.11).

The terms ?l, ?1, ?~ and ?? represent all of the motion induced by small-scale processes 
not directly resolved by the model grid (subgrid scale). They are parameterized in terms of

this application, readers are referred to [88].

For each one of the 12 accidental scenarios, the fate and transport model predicted the 

weight of oil (in kilograms), q9u91(?), on the surface of the water within each cell R] × R" 
of Figure 4.11. The fish population under assessment covers three of these cells. It was 

calculated the average oil concentration in time, Ci(x,y,z,t), for each accidental scenario, i, 

within the boundaries of these three cells (i.e. ??(]0, "0, e0, ?)). To do so, it was made the 
following calculation: 

• From a data map with the depth in each point of the ocean one gets dz (in 

meters) at the center of each cell R] × R" (in meters); 
• One calculates the volume of water in R] × R" × Re (in liters), p8'-)+(?) ?1000	 × R] × R" × Re; 
• From the results of the fate and transport model, one gets the predicted weight of 

oil (in kilograms) per R] × R", q9u91(?), and considers the same amount of oil 
per R] × R" × Re, i.e. q9u91(?) =	q9u919`(?); 

• The total weight of oil within the three population cells is q)u*,63+)(?) =
q9u919`,:)55	?(?) 
 q9u919`,:)55	P(?) 
 q9u919`,:)55	?(?); 

• Considering the density of oil equal to 910 kg/m3, one calculates the volume of 

oil (in milliliters) within the population cells, p,?5(?) ? 1000000 ×q)u*,63+)(?) 910? ; 
• The predicted concentration within the population cells is then calculated as 

??(]0, "0, e0, ?) ? p,?5(?) p8'-)+(?)? , where (x0,y0,z0) is the central point of the 
population’s location (Figure 4.7). 

This is a very conservative approach because when one makes q9u91(?) ?
	q9u919`(?), it is considered that 100% of the toxic components of oil on the surface of the 
water will actually dissolve in water. The uncertainty of such assumption will be further 

evaluated in section 4.6.6. 

4.3.2 Hazard quotient 

To select only accidental scenarios that may significantly contribute to the final 

ecological risks, it was performed a conservative screening assessment of the toxicological 

effects at individual-level for each accidental scenario. It was used the hazard quotient for 



79 

 

that, i.e. the ratio of Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) to a Predicted No Effect 

Concentration (PNEC). 

The PEC was the maximal value through time of ??(]0, "0, e0, ?); whereas PNEC was 
taken from ecotoxicological data in the reference [76]. The value for the PNEC was the LC0 

(i.e. lethal concentration to 0% of test organisms) of a related species (i.e. Parupeneus 

barberinus, that is a fish of the same order as Diapterus rhombeus, i.e. Perciformes) 

associated with crude oil. This extrapolation was needed because there were no such data on 

Diapterus rhombeus. 

Table 8 shows the PECs, PNECs and hazard quotient for each accidental scenario. The 

toxicological test parameters and results are detailed in Appendix A. It can be seen that 

PEC/PNEC is much greater than 0.01 for all accidental scenarios in the winter, justifying their 

selection for the next step (Figure 4.16). Conversely, all accidental scenarios in the summer 

had PEC/PNEC equal to zero, because in this season the oil plume moves to the south and 

does not reach the population of concern. Although it may reach other ecosystems to the 

south, those are out of the spatial boundaries of this assessment. Hence, accidental scenarios 

in summer could be ruled out of this assessment.

corresponding hazard quotient (PEC/PNEC).

4.4 Frequency estimates 

It was conducted a screening reliability analysis based on generic frequencies of Loss of 

Containment Events (LOCs) for ships in an establishment covering loading and unloading 

activities, and external impact. The reference [18] provides values for such frequencies per 

year, as well as simple procedure to calculate them, which is dependent on some specific 

circumstances about the activity of concern (those were defined in section 4.1.2). It is worth 

noting that such frequencies may overestimate risks because they do not take into account 

other specific circumstances that could reduce their values (e.g., safety management systems, 

alarms, automatic stops). 



81 

 

Table 9 presents the generic frequencies for each specific LOC. Note that all ships 

transporting oil to RNEST are double-walled tankers. 

Table 9 - Frequencies of LOCs for ships in a establishment. The base accident failure rate, f0, is equal 
to 6.7× 10-11 × T × t × N, where T is the total number of ships per year on the transport route or in 
the harbor, t the average duration of loading/unloading per ship (in hours) and N, the number of 

transhipments per year.

Accordingly, Table 10 shows the possible LOCs for the accidental scenarios 1a, 2a and 

3a. Note that ships perform unloading activities in location 3a only. The variables for 

estimating the base accident failure rate, f0, were determined in section 4.1.2 and are presented 

again in Table 11. Then, the frequency estimates for each accidental scenario, that is the sum 

of the frequencies for each possible LOC, were calculated as follows: 

 

??'("???a?) ? ?P'("a?) ? (0.006 + 0.0015) × ?0 = 1.98 × 10a? 
 

??'("a?) = ?P'("a?) + (6 × 10a? + 6 × 10a?) × 
 = 0.09504198

Also, it was defined fractional frequencies to the meteorological conditions. As already 

mentioned (section 4.3), the summer meteorological scenario varies from March to August (6 

months) and the winter from September to February (6 months). Therefore, it was considered 

that half of the year is winter and the other half is summer. Likewise, one sees spring tides 

during half of the year and neap tides during the other half, since tides alternate on a weekly 

basis. This way, each pair of meteorological condition has a frequency of 0.25 per year. As a 

result, Table 12 presents the final frequency estimates for each accidental scenario with their 

meteorological conditions. It can be seen that the values justify all accidental scenarios to be 

selected for the next steps of the methodology, since they are greater than 10-8 per year 

(Figure 4.17).

4.5 Population modeling 

4.5.1 Data gathering 

As already mentioned, it was used demographic data on juveniles of the species of 

concern, collected at the mangrove channel of the Tatuoca river during 24 consecutive months 

(from March 2008 until February 2010). 

4.5.2 Population modeling 

The population used in modeling was that described in section 3.1.3 and illustrated in 

Figure 4.7. Data was on one stage class only (i.e. juveniles), because they were collected in 

shallow waters of the Suape beach and mangrove channels, and fishes migrate to deeper 

waters as soon as they become adults. Hence, this population is made up of juveniles only. In 

addition, data provided the total length of each collected fish, so one could estimate their age 

based on the von Bertalanffy growth function [97]: 

N- ? N?./?1 ? ?a?(-a-s)?; 	????? 
N?./		?	???	? ???	??$???	????	???	?	??	 ?	?	? ?????	 $	? ??R	?????		?	???"	????	?  
?? ?		$R??	$	???"	(??? 	?$ ?$	??	??"??? ?	?	??$???); 
N-		?	???	? ???	??$???	??	???	?; 
v		?	?	?????????	????	?]???????	???	????	(1 "???? )??	??	??	???	??"??? ?	?	??$???		? 
	???? ????R; 
?		?	???	???	(	$	"????) ?	???	?	??; 
?0		?	???	?"? ????	???	???	(	$	"????)???	?	??	? ??R	??%?	??R	??	e?? 	??$???,	
??R	???	?	????"	?	??	??????	?? ?$		$	???	??$$??	R????	!?R	!"	???	?????	 $; 

There are many methods for estimating the parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth 

function (i.e. life history parameters) for a certain species. If one or more growth studies about 

the species in question are available in FishBase [82], they provide a list of the different 

estimates for different population (i.e. from different localities). There were two studies about 

Diapterus rhombeus: in a population located in the southwest coast of Puerto Rico, in 

northeastern Caribbean Sea; and in a population located in the south coast of Margarita Island, 

Venezuela. Both studies presented very similar life history parameter estimates, so that any 

choice between them would be irrelevant for our purposes. Therefore, it was randomly chosen 

to use life history parameter estimates from the study in Puerto Rico, i.e.: N?./ ? 22	??; 	v ?
	2.21 "???? ; ?$R	?0 ? W0.08	"????. 



85 

 

Afterwards, it was estimated the age, t, for each collected fish and it could be observed 

that 99,8% of individuals in the data were younger than 4 months3. As a result, the time-step 

of the model was defined at 4 months. In addition, this value is approximate to this species’ 

generation time (i.e. 4.8 months) provided by life history data on Diapterus rhombeus in the 

reference [82]. 

A population model was then implemented in the population modeling and viability 

analysis software RAMAS GIS v. 5 [34]. As the generation time of the species is 

approximately 1 time-step, the model should be scalar (i.e. unstructured): there should be just 

one stage, and the stage matrix should have a single element that is the growth rate of the 

population (R). Also, for a conservative approach, it was not include density-dependence 

effects in the model. Once again, including density-dependence in a population model to 

assess impacts of pollution would make the assessment unrealistically optimistic, because 

population would recover very fast after chemical exposure.  

Therefore, the model projected the population abundance (N) forward 100 years (or 300 

time-steps) from the initial population abundance estimate (22,111 individuals) using the 

mathematical expression: 
(? 
 1) = ?(?) × 
(?). Temporal variability was incorporated 
into R by establishing a lognormal distribution with a mean equal to 1.001 and a standard 

deviation (SD) equal to 0.01. It was made a simulation with 10,000 replications. For each 

time-step during each replication, a value to R was randomly selected. 

All parameters of the model in question are summarized in Table 13. Note that the 

model with such parameters describes the natural population dynamics (without chemical 

exposure). In other words, it describes a non-impact scenario.

4.5.3 Validation of the model 

It was used the subprogram RAMAS Metapop included in the software RAMAS GIS 

v.5 [34] to run the population model and check the future natural population dynamics (i.e. 

without chemical exposure). RAMAS GIS and RAMAS Metapop have already been validated 

at the program level, by checking all subunits and algorithms of the subprograms, by making 

sure that the program does what is described in the manual, by checking the lower-level 

algorithms for consistency (e.g., environmental stochasticity distribution) [98]. 

It is worth mentioning that RAMAS GIS and RAMAS Metapop do not allow users to 

change their algorithms. If the modeler finds that such algorithm is not capable of simulating 

the case-specific model, one should think about either programming its own algorithm or 

using other software. Several software are already available for use in risk assessment of toxic 

substances. Pastorok et al. [3] conducted a critical evaluation of ecological models that are 

potentially useful for QERA. 

Not only the validation at the software level, but also the validation at the model level is 

responsibility of the modeler. To validate the model, it was verified the following issues: 

• Do the results of the model address the risk assessment objectives? Yes, the 

results provide risk measures (e.g. risk of extinction, population abundance 

decline) that are within the expected results of the QERA. 

• Do the assumptions and limitations of the model fit the species being modeled? 

Yes. The assumptions make a close approximation to reality that is sufficient for 

the objectives of the assessment. Most of the limitations are not originated from 

the model, but from poor data. 

• Are the parameters of the model reasonable? Yes. In fact, since there is no 

chemical exposure, it is expected that the population abundance will remain 

stable. This means that the population growth rate should be something around 

1. The population growth rate is given by the eigenvalue of the stage matrix, 

which is equal to 1.001 and approximate to 1. 

The Figure 4.18 shows one of the results of the model. It can be seen that the population 

abundance increases slightly and this is, in fact, expected since the population growth rate is 



87 

 

slightly greater than 1. Actually, it would be more realistic if the population abundance 

fluctuated around the same level, what could be modeled by including density-dependence 

effects. On the one hand, it would make the assessment of a non-impact scenario more 

realistic; on the other, it would make the assessment of an accidental scenario extremely 

optimistic and even unrealistic, because density-dependence effects would cause the 

population to recover very fast after an accident. In other words, massive population mortality 

would happen after an accident, and so would density-dependence effects cause the 

population growth rate to increase. This is quite unrealistic because after an oil spill it is 

expected that fishes find difficulties to feed and reproduce. 

All things verified and justified, the model was considered to be correct.

replications at time t; the vertical blue bars represent ±1 standard deviations; and the red points re present the minimum and maximum values.

4.5.4 Uncertainty analysis 

This section deals with variability in the results originated from environmental 

stochasticity in population modeling. Uncertainty in the results of the whole QERA will be 

further evaluated. 

As defined in the risk assessment objectives, variability is considered acceptable as long 

as the width of the 95% confidence interval in the results of the time to “half loss” (i.e. 50% 

population decline) is smaller than 1%. The results of this measure for this population model 

showed that the widest 95% confidence interval varies from 0 (i.e. 0% risk of half loss for all 

t) to 0.0089 (i.e. 0.89% risk of half loss for all t). As a result, uncertainty was accepted and 

that is the end of this step. 

4.6 Risk quantification and evaluation 

Here, there is essential need for the following input elements, which are output elements 

of the previous steps: 

• A population model for the population of Diapterus rhombeus, located at the 

Suape beach (next to latitude 8º39’S and longitude 34º87’W) within a region of 

about 7850 square meters, as illustrated in Figure 4.7. This was formulated in 

the fifth step of the methodology. 

• The time-step of the population model is 4 months. 

• A predicted concentration ??(]0, "0, e0, ?) at the center of the population 
boundaries, for each accidental scenario, i; t in the same unit as the time-step of 

the model. These are presented in Table 14. 

• The frequency estimate of each accidental scenario, i, per time-step of the 

model, Fi(t
-1). As the time step is 4 months and there are 12 months in a year, 

?(?a?) ? ?("???a?) 3? . These values are also presented in the Table 14. 

Table 14 – Input elements for risk quantification and evaluation. The time-step, t, is 4 months. 
Ci(x,y,z,T) is the predicted average concentration of oil within the area of concern T units of time-step 

after the occurrence of the accidental scenario, i. Fi(t
-1) is the frequency of occurrence of the 

accidental scenario per time-step.

4.6.1 Exposure-response assessment 

To build a dose-response function, ecotoxicological data were extrapolated from a 

related species (i.e. Parupeneus barberinus, that is a fish of the same order as Diapterus 

rhombeus) associated with crude oil. The toxicological data, test parameters and results are 

detailed in Appendix A. These data provide three points for an exposure-response assessment, 

as related in Table 15.

Parupeneus barberinus.

Based on these three points, it was added a logarithmic trendline, since it was expected 

that the rate of change in the function quickly increases and then levels out. Also, it was the 

best-fit curved line among several attempts of other five different trend or regression types 

(e.g., linear trendline, polynomial, power, exponential, or moving average trendline). The R-

squared value was 0.9953, which is a relatively good fit of the line to the data.

The fitted curve was then defined as the dose-response function. As a result, Table 14 

can be updated by defining the response in function of ?¢?(]0, "0, e0, U), as presented in the 
Table 16.

4.6.2 Assessing impacts and risks of each accidental scenario 

Firstly, a simulation of a non-impact scenario was made, so that it could be compared 

with the accidental scenarios. The input parameters for a non-impact scenario were already 

presented in Table 13. Subsequently, one assesses impacts and risks of each accidental 

scenario through the two approaches described in section 2.5.5. 

4.6.2.1 Assessing impacts of each accidental scenario 

This approach compared only the impacts of each accidental scenario. By ignoring its 

frequency of occurrence, one considers that the accidental scenario is sure to occur.  

Note that for all accidental scenarios, massive population mortality happens only at the 

time step that the oil spill occurs (T = 0), i.e. the first four months after an oil spill. That is 

because it takes at most 3 days until the oil plume reaches the population and one time-step is 

much longer than that. In the next time steps (T &gt; 0), no mortality happens because of the 

accidental scenario4. Consequently, there was no need to assess impacts through time, but 

only at the time step T = 0. In other words, a simulation was not necessary to estimate the 

average population mortality associated with each accidental scenario, that would be simply 

the initial population abundance (i.e. 22,111 individuals) times the fraction of mortality. Table 

17 presents the number of deaths associated with each accidental scenario. 

Table 17 – Number of deaths associated with each accidental scenario, based on the initial 
population abundance (i.e. 22,111 individuals) and on the fraction of mortality.

3a-winter-spring tide 0.66 14,593

4 Mortality would keep happening through time if, for example, accidental scenario consisted of a continuous oil 
spill from an oil well during more than one time-step. 



93 

 

4.6.2.2 Assessing risks of each accidental scenario 

Three new models were implemented to represent accidental scenarios 1a, 2a and 3a. To 

do so, one incorporated into the non-impact scenario model a source of environmental 

stochasticity that is independent of the year-to-year temporal variation of the growth rate. This 

is known as catastrophe.  

It was included two catastrophes for each of the three new models, representing their 

possible meteorological conditions in the winter (i.e. neap tide or spring tide). All 

catastrophes had a certain frequency of occurrence per time-step (4 months), i.e. ?(?a?) ?
?("???a?) 3? . Thus, for each time-step of each replication, a catastrophe was randomly 
selected to strike. If it does, it causes a certain fraction of mortality (originated from the dose-

response function) to the population at that time-step.  

Table 18 shows the parameter values for each of the three new models.

Then, the results of each model were compared to the results of the model for a non-

impact scenario. Figures (Figure 4.20 and Figure 4.21) compare a non-impact scenario with 

each of the accidental scenarios. In the former, each point in the curve can be interpreted as 

“there is a Y% risk that, 100 years from now, the population abundance will be less than X”. 

In the latter, each point can be interpreted as “there is a Y% risk that the population 

abundance will fall by 50% (half loss) in or before time-step X”. 

Over 100 years, there is a chance that the population will naturally become extinct. This 

chance is defined as the background risk. As the potential consequences of different 

accidental scenarios are measured in terms of probabilities, it is possible to compare them 

against the background risks that a population faces in the absence of any potential accidental 

scenario (i.e. a no-impact scenario). Added risk means the increase in risk of extinction (or 

decline) that results from some impact on a natural population [35]. 

It can be seen that accidental scenario 3a is the only one that causes significant increase 

in risk of extinction when compared with a no-impact scenario. Extinction risk curves for no-

impact scenario and accidental scenarios 1a and 2a are statistically superimposed. Also, the 

accidental scenario 3a is the only one with significant chances to cause population “half loss” 

in the next 100 years. This certainly happens because accidental scenarios 1a and 2a are 

extremely rare (i.e. frequency of occurrence is too small). 

All things considered, the accidental scenario 3a is the only one that may need 

management actions in order to reduce its risks. However, some further assessment is needed 

to make such a conclusion.

interpreted as “there is a Y% risk that, 100 years from now, the population abundance will be less than X”. The dotted line indicates the average value, whereas 

the solid lines the 95% confidence intervals. The 3 vertical bars with two horizontal tabs represent the maximum difference between a non-impact scenario and an 
accidental scenario. The difference is measured as the maximum vertical distance between the curve. The location of the maximum difference (the threshold value 

at which the difference is maximum) may be different for different curves. The box to the upper right reports the values of the differences. The color of the text is the 
same as the color of the risk curve with which the first (dark blue) curve is compared. The reported number is the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic D (which is the 

maximum vertical difference). The asterisks give the significance level (*: 0.05, **: 0.01, ***: 0.001, ns: not significant), based on two-sample Kolmogorov-
Smirnov test [34; 99].

Figure 4.21 - Comparison of a non-impact scenario with each of the accidental scenarios, in terms of time to “half loss” (i.e. 50% population abundance 
decline). Each point in a curve can be interpreted as “there is a Y% risk that the population abundance will fall by 50% (half loss) in or before time-step X”. In this 

graph, there are two plots for each scenario. The histogram (vertical bar graph) shows the probability that the population size will fall below the specified 
threshold exactly at a specific time step. The continuous curve is the cumulative probability distribution, and it shows the probability of falling below at or before a 
specific time step. The 95% confidence intervals are also plotted together with the continuous curve. The graph is scaled according to the cumulative distribution 

and that is why the histogram is nearly imperceptible. If the median of a distribution is within the simulated time period (as happens with accidental scenario 3a), it 
is indicated by the solid vertical line. Both the line and the number for the median are in the same color as the distribution, so one can identify which simulation the 

median refers to. 

 



98 

 

4.6.3 Risk categorization 

It was used the risk criteria proposed in section 2.5.7, Table 3. For better reading, they 

are copied here: 

Table 19 - Categories for assessing risks of each accidental scenario in a QERA. 

Category Risk of half loss Years 

Critically Endangered &gt; 50% 10 

Endangered &gt; 20% 20 

Vulnerable &gt; 10% 100 

Low Risk &gt; 0.1% 100 

Negligible &gt; 0.001% 100 

Background risk &amp;lt;0.001% 100 

 

Both accidental scenarios 1a and 2a are statistically equal (in terms of 95% confidence 

interval) to a non-impact scenario, so that they belong to the same risk category. Looking at 

the data that originates the Figure 4.21, the cumulative probability of the time to half loss, 

there is a 0% risk (95% confidence interval from 0% to 0.0089%) that the population 

abundance will fall below 11,055 (half loss) individuals in or before time-step 300 (i.e. 100 

years). This way, they vary from a “Background risk” to a “Negligible” category. 

Concerning accidental scenario 3a, Figure 4.22 illustrates its risk categorization. The 

necessary points for such categorization are related in the Table 20. One could then conclude 

that accidental scenario 3a causes the population of concern to be categorized as 

“Endangered”.

4.6.4 Cumulating risks of all accidental scenarios 

It is considered here all accidental scenarios selected to the current step of methodology 

(risk quantification and evaluation), i.e. accidental scenarios 1a, 2a and 3a in the winter. By 

cumulating the frequencies (Table 21) for which the number of deaths of a particular 

accidental scenario, siN , is greater than or equal to N, it was built the FN curve presented in 

the Figure 4.23. 

The y-axis is in logarithmic scale and that is because the frequency of occurrence of 

20121 or more deaths was defined at 10a¤/"??? instead of zero. The value of 10a¤/"??? is 
the frequency criterion (in the fourth step of the methodology, i.e. frequency estimates) to 

screen out accidental scenarios that are irrelevant in terms of risk. Therefore, ecological risks 

from any event that occurs with a frequency less than that are considered to be none (zero).

4.6.5 Sensitivity analysis 

It is worth exploring the sensitivity to parameters of the model for accidental scenario 

3a, so that one can understand how changes on specific parameters cause changes in risk 

measures. Firstly, one analyzed how reductions in the frequency of occurrence can reduce 

ecological risks. This is mostly useful to understand how important is the fourth step (i.e. 

frequency estimates) of this methodology to the results of this specific QERA. As already 

mentioned, the methodology is interactive. In this sense, if the risk assessor finds it 

appropriate, more work on reliability analysis can be done in order to calculate more accurate 

frequency estimates, and so more accurate risks. Moreover, analyzing the sensitivity to the 

frequency estimates provides information to the risk manager who wishes to evaluate control 

measures and preventive actions (e.g., safety management systems, alarms, automatic stops) 

which can reduce the accidental scenario’s frequency of occurrence and so reduce the risks. 

Several simulations were made with the primary model for accidental scenario 3a, 

gradually reducing the frequency of occurrence. The Figure 4.24 presents the results of 4 

simulations in which frequencies were reduced by 20%, 50%, 90% and 98%. It can be 

observed that even after a 98% reduction in its frequency of occurrence, risks remain still 



102 

 

high, i.e. 0.0843 risk of half loss in the next 100 years (95% confidence interval from 0.0754 

to 0.0932). 



103 

 

 

 

Figure 4.24 - Sensitivity analysis that express changes in risks measures(i.e. cumulative probability of the time to half loss) as a function of changes in the 
frequency of occurrence of accidental scenario 3a. Each point in a curve can be interpreted as “there is a Y% risk that the population abundance will fall by 50% 

(half loss) in or before time-step X”. If the median of a distribution is within the simulated time period, it is indicated by the solid vertical line. Both the line and the 
number for the median are in the same color as the distribution, so one can identify which simulation the median refers to. 



104 

 

Secondly, it was analyzed how reductions in the consequences can reduce ecological 

risks. This is useful to the risk manager who wants to evaluate recovery measures and 

mitigation actions (e.g. re-routing of spills, burning the oil before it reaches an ecosystem, 

pollution remediation, habitat protection, translocation of individuals) which can reduce the 

magnitude of the consequences and so reduce the risks. 

Several simulations were made with the primary model for accidental scenario 3a, 

gradually reducing the adverse effects on population (in fraction of mortality). Figure 4.25 

presents the results for 3 of them, in which the fraction of mortality was reduced by 30%, 50% 

and 80%.

before time-step X”. If the median of a distribution is within the simulated time period, it is indicated by the solid vertical line. Both the line and the number for the 
median are in the same color as the distribution, so one can identify which simulation the median refers to. 



106 

 

Lastly, it was included density dependence in both primary models for a non-impact 

scenario and accidental scenario 3a. Density dependence included affects the single element 

in the stage matrix (i.e. the growth rate, R); density dependence type is Scramble because it is 

thought that resources are shared more-or-less equally among the juveniles; maximal growth 

rate (Rmax) is 1.222; carrying capacity (K) is equal to the initial population abundance (i.e. 

11,222 individuals); standard deviation of K is zero. 

The rationale for analyzing the sensitivity to density dependence was to reinforce what 

had already been stated in this work: including density dependence in a population model to 

assess impacts of pollution makes the assessment less conservative, because population 

recovers faster after exposure. In other words, modeling density dependence may 

underestimate ecological risks originated from industrial accidents. 

It is worth stressing that an accidental scenario’s model that includes density 

dependence has to be compared with a non-impact scenario’s model that also includes density 

dependence. The Figure 4.26 shows such comparison. As expected, the maximum difference 

between risks including density dependence (i.e. 0.27) was smaller than the maximum 

difference between risks not including density dependence (i.e. 0.99, see Figure 4.20). 

Therefore, changes in risks from a non-impact scenario to accidental scenario 3a are smaller if 

density dependence is included in both models. 

 



107 

 

 

 

Figure 4.26 – Risk sensitivity to density dependence in both models for a non-impact scenario and accidental scenario 3a. This figure must be compared 
with Figure 4.20 to understand the changes. Each point in a curve can be interpreted as “there is a Y% risk that, 100 years from now, the population abundance 
will be less than X”. The dotted line indicates the average value, whereas the solid lines the 95% confidence intervals. The vertical bar with two horizontal tabs 
represent the maximum difference between a non-impact scenario and accidental scenario 3a. The box to the upper right reports the value of the difference. The 

color of the text is the same as the color of the risk curve with which the first (dark blue) curve is compared. The reported number is the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test 
statistic D (which is the maximum vertical difference). The value X to the upper left is the x-value at which the difference is maximum.

4.6.6 Uncertainty analysis 

This section is concerned with one of the objectives of the QERA (defined in the first 

step), i.e. to deal with uncertainty of significant accidental scenarios. In this context, 

uncertainty was measured by estimating a range (lower bound and upper bound) to risk 

measures based on the best case and worst case of accidental scenario 3a. 

Up until here, all parameters for the assessment had been defined from a conservative 

point of view. Consequently, the presented risk measures associated with accidental scenario 

3a represent the worst case. It was then conducted a simulation from an optimistic point of 

view in an effort to represent the best case of accidental scenario 3a. As a result, the following 

changes were made in the primary model for accidental scenario 3a (i.e. that of its worst 

case): 

• Frequencies were reduced by 20%. 

• Density-dependence was included in the model. Density dependence included 

affects the single element in the stage matrix (i.e. the growth rate, R); density 

dependence type is Scramble; maximal growth rate (Rmax) is 1.2497; carrying 

capacity (K) is 10,990; standard deviation of K is zero.  

• It was considered that only 50% of the components of oil on the surface of the 

water will actually dissolve in water, i.e. q9u919`(?) ? 0.5 × q9u91(?)	. This 
way, PNECs were further calculated using the procedure in section 4.3. 

Afterwards, the responses (in fraction of mortality) were calculated through the 

dose-response function in section 4.6.1. 

The new frequencies and fractions of mortality for a best case scenario are presented in 

Table 22. The results for measuring uncertainty (lower and upper bounds) are presented in the 

Figure 4.27. Looking at time step 60 (i.e. 20 years), one can conclude that even from an 

optimistic point of view, risks originated from accidental scenario 3a cause the population of 

concern to be categorized as “Endangered” (i.e. at least 20% risk of half loss in the next 20 

years, according to section 2.5.7.

5 CONCLUSIONS 

The primary objective of this work was to develop and propose a methodology for 

QERA for industrial accidents. Indeed, it was presented a methodology capable of quantifying 

ecological risks caused by events with low frequency of occurrence but that may cause 

catastrophic ecological damage. The main goal of the proposed methodology was to integrate 

information from four different studies that can contribute to quantify ecological risks 

originating from rare events. Besides that, the specific objectives of this work were achieved 

since the methodology: 

• uses reliability analysis for estimating frequencies of occurrence of accidental 

scenarios caused by equipment failure or human error; 

• uses fate and transport modeling to predict individual-level exposure in case of a 

particular accidental scenario; 

• uses dose-response modeling and hazard quotient to estimate individual-level 

adverse effects; 

• uses population modeling to translate individual-level into population-level 

adverse effects; 

• provides results that allows for the comparison among accidental scenarios, as a 

basis for prioritizing risk management measures under limited resources; 

• presents the total ecological risks of an establishment in a single risk measure 

(i.e. FN risk curve), as a simple way to communicate risks to stakeholders; 

• deals with environmental variability in time and space; 

• can point out further work that can effectively improve results via a sensitivity 

analysis; 

• can deal with uncertainty, measuring it and communicating it to risk managers 

on a quantitative basis; 

• is flexible in terms of data needs, i.e. can use several types of data; 

• uses objective criteria throughout the second, third and fourth steps in order to 

rule out accidental scenarios that will not contribute to the final ecological risk, 

avoiding waste of cost and time; 

• was tested in an application example and proved to be practicable, efficient and 

convenient. Because most data for applying the methodology was already 

available from other studies and public databases, the methodology could be 



111 

 

applied in a relatively short period of time, i.e. about 5 months.  If no data were 

available, it is estimated that collecting data for such an assessment and applying 

the methodology would take about 2 years. 

 

More benefits of the methodology are described step by step as follows. The first step of 

the methodology allows for an improved knowledge about dangerous installations within an 

establishment, chemicals of concern and characteristics of the ecological environments 

possibly affected by accidents. It also encourages interaction of the risk assessor with other 

professionals such as risk managers, environmental managers, ecologists, technical managers 

and operators of the establishment. The second step allows to systematically identify the 

existing accidents and their possible ecological damage, causing an improved level of 

preparation to emergencies. 

The third step provides a screening assessment of the ecological damage possibly 

caused by the identified accidents. Individual-level exposure is predicted via fate and 

transport models. Most of these models are deterministic and some uncertainty in the results 

of the QERA is originated from their predictions. Uncertainty can be reduced by identifying 

the most influent meteorological conditions and creating meteorological scenarios. 

The frequencies of the accidental scenarios are estimated in the fourth step. Also, some 

uncertainty in the results of the QERA is originated from frequency estimates. This can be 

minimized by conducting a detailed case-specific reliability analysis. 

The fifth step of the methodology uses mathematical modeling applied to ecology (i.e. 

population modeling) to translate individual-level exposure (predicted in the third step) into 

population-level effects. Population modeling proved to be an efficient approach to quantify 

ecological impacts caused by industrial accidents, providing results in more relevant units 

than individual-level effects. The iterative process in implementing a population model was 

presented in a comprehensive scheme built by the author. 

Some uncertainty in the final results of the QERA is originated from uncertainty in the 

population model, which is originated from: difficulties in data gathering; difficulties in 

parameter estimation; weak ability to validate population models; effects of alternative model 

structures. Nonetheless, uncertainty is an indelible characteristic of any future prediction. It 

does not make population modeling unfeasible as long as it is evaluated and communicated to 

decision makers. To make this claim, one needs to correctly represent uncertainty in the 

results. In this sense, the methodology measures uncertainty by estimating a range (lower 



112 

 

bound and upper bound) to risk measures based on the best and worst case of accidental 

scenarios. 

Besides being useful to a QERA for industrial accidents, the population model built in 

the fifth step provides relevant information to tackle many key gaps in environmental 

management, such as optimal resource allocation for monitoring affected areas, optimal 

management of threatened and endangered species, and spatial planning for landscape 

restoration and management. 

The ecological risks originating from accidents in an establishment is quantified in the 

sixth step. Risks can be assessed in two ways: (1) by a comparative approach, in which 

ecological risks related to each accidental scenario are compared with ecological risks in the 

absence of any potential accidental scenario (i.e. a no-impact scenario); and (2) by a 

cumulative approach, in which ecological risks of all accidental scenarios are cumulated and 

presented as a FN curve. Both ways provide quantitative and relevant information to support 

the decision-making process for managing possible ecological catastrophes. Thus, the 

decision maker could evaluate different alternatives of risk reduction via a cost-benefit 

analysis. It is important to note again that the proposed methodology is interactive, so that 

revaluation may occur during any part of the assessment or new information can be 

incorporated to improve results. 

It is worth mentioning that the methodology usually requires more than one person to 

perform it. In other words, the methodology demands team work because specific knowledge 

on several different fields of studies is necessary. In most cases, team should be composed by 

an ecological risk assessor, an ecologist, a fate and transport modeler (e.g., an oceanographer, 

if toxic disperses through the ocean), a reliability analyst and a system engineer. 

5.1 Limitations 

• There are better ways of measuring and communicating uncertainty than the 

approach used in the methodology (i.e. based on the difference between the best 

and worst case of accidental scenarios). 

• No risk criteria were proposed in the FN risk curve. Although risk criteria was 

proposed for categorizing each accidental scenario alone (in terms of probability 

of the time to half loss), no risk criteria were proposed for the cumulative risks 

of all accidental scenarios in the FN curve. 



113 

 

• The parameters for the population model are estimated through historical data 

only, ignoring expert opinion. 

5.2 Future studies 

In order to tackle the limitations of the methodology, it is proposed the following future 

studies: 

• to study the several concepts and techniques of uncertainty analysis in 

population models, compare their performances, determine the best way to 

estimate and communicate uncertainty in a QERA for industrial accidents, and 

incorporate it into the methodology; 

• to propose ecological risk criteria for acceptability in terms of the results 

provided by the FN risk curve. 

• to investigate the role of expert opinion (i.e. ecologists) in order to improve the 

parameterization of a population model, focusing on the study of Bayesian 

methods to do so. 

• to incorporate expert opinion in the fifth step (i.e. population modeling) of the 

methodology using Bayesian methods. 

5.3 Conclusions to the application example 

The results of the QERA showed that ecological risks from accidental scenario 3a cause 

the fish population of concern to be categorized as “Endangered” (according to section 4.6.3) 

even in a best case scenario. Conversely, ecological risks from other accidental scenarios are 

negligible. From this point of view, management actions should be taken to reduce the 

frequency of occurrence and/or the magnitude of the consequences of accidental scenario 3a, 

until risks reach an acceptable level (i.e. “Low risk” category). 

5.3.1 Limitations 

• The fate and transport model predicted the kilograms of crude oil on the surface 

of the ocean within each cell R] × R". However, the key species of concern do 
not live only on the surface of the water, but in a depth range up to 70 meters 

[100]. In this context, it was made a crude approximation to convert kilograms 

of petroleum per area of water into milliliter of oil per volume of water.  



114 

 

• The frequencies were estimated based on average situations (i.e. generic 

frequencies) and did not take into account many specific circumstances of the 

accidental scenario under assessment (e.g., human error, control measures). 

• Input data to parameterize the population model was poor, i.e.:  

o The sampler area was too small (20 m²), leading to high standard 

deviations in parameter estimates (e.g., population growth rate). 

o Data did not allow the population model to be age/stage structured, 

because they were about juvenile individuals only. 

o Data were collected in a specific location where no amount of oil was 

predicted in case of accident, so there was a need to extrapolate the 

location of the fish population in order to take into account chemical 

effects caused by oil exposure. 

o ecotoxicological data to build a dose-response curve was extrapolated 

from a related species; 

• Ecological risks related to accidental scenarios in the summer (when the oil 

plume moves to the south) were not calculated because the oil plume does not 

reach the fish population of concern, although it may reach others populations to 

the south. 

5.3.2 Future application 

As the methodology is interactive, any new information and revaluation can be 

incorporated into the assessment at any time, starting a new round of the methodology, until 

results are reliable enough to be presented to risk managers. 

This section concerns about proposing a second round of the methodology in the 

application example in order to improve results of the first round. In the second round, there is 

no need to redo every single step of the methodology. Instead, it should tackle the limitations 

in the results of the first round (section 5.3.1). In this context, the first round was useful to 

point out what new efforts can effectively improve results, they are: 

• To model the fate and transport of oil in the water (i.e. per water columm 

R] × R" × Re) instead of on the surface of the water (i.e. per water cell R] ×
R"). As the POM is a three-dimensional model, it is also indicated for such 
modeling. 



115 

 

• To conduct a more detailed reliability analysis in order to estimate more accurate 

frequencies concerning specific circumstances of the accidental scenario under 

assessment. In fact, reliability engineering is a well-developed field of study, so 

that a more detailed reliability analysis (including generic equipment failures, 

control measures and human error) is possible. 

• To gather richer input data for the population model. Perhaps, one may need to 

choose as indicator a population of another representative species in the coastal 

region of Suape, i.e.: 

o A species that is easier to monitor (i.e. bigger size, smaller abundance, 

and longer life spam).  

o Ecologists should have been collecting data about this population 

dynamics since more than 2 years up until the present. 

o Data should include all age/stage classes of the population. 

o Sampler size should be more representative. 

o At best, ecotoxicological data about the species should be available. 

o The location where data is collected should be over a region where 

significant amounts of oil are predicted (in case of accident). In this 

context, the first round of the methodology helps to decide this location.  

o If no richer data is already available, it will be necessary to collect these 

data. This would take at least 2 years. Nonetheless, the first round of the 

methodology provides basis of knowledge for an effective data collection 

directed to a QERA. 

• To include another population to the south of the release points and to build a 

metapopulation model with potential for migration between the two populations. 

This way, ecological risks related to accidental scenarios in the summer could be 

also quantified.

GLOSSARY 

 

Abundance: the total number or density (number per unit area or unit volume) of 

organisms in a given location. 

Acute toxicity: the ability of a chemical to cause a toxic response in organisms 

immediately or shortly after exposure. 

Adverse ecological effects: Changes that are considered undesirable because they alter 

valued structural or functional characteristics of ecosystems or their components. An 

evaluation of adversity may consider the type, intensity, and scale of the effect as well as the 

potential for recovery. 

Age Class: a category comprising individuals of a given age within a population. 

Agent: Any physical, chemical, or biological entity that can induce an adverse response 

(synonymous with stressor). 

Age-specific fecundity: the number of eggs or offspring produced per unit time by an 

individual of a specified age. 

Age-specific survival: the proportion of individuals of age x alive at time t who will be 

alive at time t+1. 

Assessment endpoint: environmental characteristic or value that is to be protected (e.g. 

population abundance, species diversity, or ecosystem productivity).  

Biodegradation: a process by which microbial organisms transform or alter (through 

metabolic or enzymatic action) the structure of chemicals introduced into the environment. 

Biomarkers: measures of body fluids, cells, tissues or measures taken on the whole 

organism, indicating, in terms biochemical, cellular, physiological, compartmental or 

energetic, the presence of contaminants substances or the magnitude of the response of the 

target organism. 

Biota: living groups of organisms or species. 

Biotic: living organisms, usually referring to the biological components of an 

ecosystem. 

Chronic toxicity: the ability of a chemical to produce a toxic response when an 

organism is exposed over a long period of time. 

Community: an assemblage of populations of different species within a specified 

location in space and time. Sometimes, a particular subgrouping may be specified, such as the 

fish community in a lake or the soil arthropod community in a forest. 



131 

 

Conceptual model: A conceptual model in problem formulation is a written description 

and visual representation of predicted relationships between ecological entities and the 

stressors to which they may be exposed. 

Density dependence: a change in the influence of any factor (a density-dependent 

factor) that affects population growth as population density changes. Density-dependent 

factors tend to retard population growth by increasing mortality or emigration or decreasing 

fecundity as population density increases. They enhance population growth by decreasing 

mortality or increasing fecundity as population density decreases. 

Dose: the amount of chemical taken into an organism per unit of time. 

Deadweight tonnage: a measure of how much weight a ship is carrying or can safely 

carry. It is the sum of the weights of cargo, fuel, fresh water, ballast water, provisions, 

passengers, and crew. 

¥¦§?: the toxicant concentration at which 50% of the test organisms show effects (e.g. 
mortality). 

Ecological entity: A general term that may refer to a species, a group of species, an 

ecosystem function or characteristic, or a specific habitat. An ecological entity is one 

component of an assessment endpoint. 

Ecological model: a mathematical expression that can be used to describe or predict 

ecological processes or endpoints such as population abundance (or density), community 

species richness, productivity, or distributions of organisms. 

Ecological relevance: One of the three criteria for assessment endpoint selection. 

Ecologically relevant endpoints reflect important characteristics of the system and are 

functionally related to other endpoints. 

Ecological risk assessment: The process that evaluates the likelihood that adverse 

ecological effects may occur or are occurring as a result of exposure to one or more stressors. 

Ecosystem: the interacting system of a biological community and its non-living 

environmental surroundings. 

Ecotoxicology: the branch of toxicology concerned with the study of toxic effects, 

caused by natural or synthetic pollutants, to the constituents of ecosystems, animal (including 

human), vegetable and microbial, in an integral context. 

Emigration: the movement of an individual or group out of an area or population. 

Endpoint: the biological or ecological unit or variable being measured or assessed. 



132 

 

Environmental impact statement (EIS): Environmental impact statements are 

prepared under the national environmental policy act by federal agencies as they evaluate the 

environmental consequences of proposed actions. EISs describe baseline environmental 

conditions; the purpose of, need for, and consequences of a proposed action; the no-action 

alternative; and the consequences of a reasonable range of alternative actions. A separate risk 

assessment could be prepared for each alternative, or a comparative risk assessment might be 

developed. However, risk assessment is not the only approach used in EISs. 

Exposure: The contact or co-occurrence of a stressor with a receptor. 

Exposure-response assessment: a description of the relationship between the 

concentration (or dose) of the chemical that causes adverse effects and the magnitude of the 

response of the receptor. 

Fate and transport model:  a description of how a chemical is carried through the 

environment. This may include transport through biological as well as physical parts of the 

environment. 

Fecundity: the number of live offspring per individual in a given age class that will 

survive to be counted in the first age class. 

Fish measurement: Standard Length (SL) refers to the length of a fish measured 

from the tip of the snout to the posterior end of the last vertebra or to the posterior end of the 

midlateral portion of the hypural plate. Simply put, this measurement excludes the length of 

the caudal fin; 

Total length (TL) refers to the length from the tip of the snout to the tip of the longer 

lobe of the caudal fin, usually measured with the lobes compressed along the midline. It is a 

straight-line measure, not measured over the curve of the body; Fork length (FL) refers to 

the length from the tip of the snout to the end of the middle caudal fin rays. 

Geographic information system (GIS): software that combines a database and 

mapping capability; often used in spatially explicit modeling. 

Grow rate: the rate of change of population abundance. Depending on the context, 

growth rate could also refer to the rate of change in mass or size of an organism. 

Habitat: the place where animals and plants normally live, often characterized by a 

dominant plant form or physical characteristic. 

Hazard quotient: the ratio of an estimated exposure concentration (or dose) to a 

toxicity threshold expressed in the same units. 



133 

 

Immigration: the movement of an individual or group into a new population or 

geographical region. 

Indicator species: species thought to be more sensitive and therefore serve as an early 

warning indicator of ecological effects. 

Key species: species strategically chosen to represent ecological effects in the risk 

assessment. Key species can be, for example, indicator species that are thought to be more 

sensitive and therefore serve as an early warning indicator of ecological effects, species of 

scientific and economic importance, rare and endangered species, or any species to be 

protected. 

Landscape: the traits, patterns, and structure of a specific geographic area, including its 

biological composition, its physical environment, and its anthropogenic or social patterns. An 

area where interacting ecosystems are grouped and repeated in similar form. 

Life stage: a developmental stage of an organism (for example, juvenile, adult, egg, 

pupa, larva). 

Life story: the temporal pattern and habitat association of life stages (e.g. egg, larva, 

pupa and adult in an insect or egg, fry, smolt, juvenile, and adult in a salmon) and the 

schedule of births and deaths for a species. 

Lowest-observed-effect-level (LOEL): the lowest concentration or amount of a 

substance, found by experiment or observation under the same defined conditions of 

exposure, that causes any alteration in morphology, functional capacity, growth, development, 

or life span of target organisms. 

Measurement endpoints: quantitative expressions of an observed or measured 

biological response, such as the effects of a toxic chemical on survivorship or fecundity, 

related to the valued environmental characteristic chosen as the assessment endpoint. 

Migration: the movement of an individual or group into or out of an area or population. 

Mortality: the number of individuals of a population that died in a given period of time. 

Neap tide: when the tide’s range is at its minimum. 

No-observed-effect-level (NOEL): the greatest concentration or amount of a substance, 

found by experiment or observation under the same defined conditions of exposure, that 

causes no alterations of morphology, functional capacity, growth, development, or life span of 

target organisms. 

Organism: any form of animal or plant life. 



134 

 

Population growth rate: the rate at which numbers of individuals are added to the 

population over time. 

Population: a group of interbreeding organisms occupying a particular space. 

Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC): the local maximum of a predicted 

concentration function C(x,y,z,t) related to an accidental scenario. 

Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC): the concentration below which exposure 

to a substance is not expected to cause adverse effects. 

Productivity: the rate of production of living biomass in a population or community. 

Receptor: The ecological entity that might be exposed to a stressor. 

Recovery: The rate and extent of return of a population or community to some aspect(s) 

of its previous condition. Because of the dynamic nature of ecological systems, the attributes 

of a “recovered” system should be carefully defined. 

Recovery measures: mitigation actions which could reduce the magnitude of the 

consequences of an accidental scenario, and so reduce the risk. 

Remedial action goals: a subset of remedial action objectives consisting of medium-

specific chemical concentrations that are protective of human health and the ecological 

environment. 

Spatially explicit model:  a model that tracks spatial information (e.g. the locations of 

organisms or the pattern of a landscape). 

Species: An organism belonging to such a category, represented in binomial 

nomenclature by an uncapitalized Latin adjective or noun following a capitalized genus name, 

as in Ananas comosus, the pineapple, and Equus caballus, the horse. 

Species richness: the total number of species in a location or the number per unit area 

or volume. 

Spring tide: when the tide’s range is at its maximum. It is not named after the season 

(i.e. spring) but, like that word, derives from an earlier meaning of jump, burst forth, rise as in 

a natural spring. 

Stressor: any physical, chemical, or biological entity that can induce an adverse 

response in an organism. 

Survival: the number of individuals of a population that are alive after a given period of 

time. 

Threshold: the chemical concentration (or dose) at which physical or biological effects 

begin to be produced. 



135 

 

Toxicity extrapolation model: any mathematical expression for extrapolating toxicity 

data between species, endpoints, exposure durations, and so forth. Also includes uncertainty 

factors. 

Toxicity test: a test in which organisms are exposed to chemicals in a test medium (for 

example, waste, sediment, soil) to determine the effects of exposure.
