A produção do 5-hidroximetilfurfural (HMF) a partir da desidratação de açúcares é uma 
alternativa para a obtenção de materiais de partida na produção de poliésteres, poliamidas 
e poliuretano a partir de fontes renováveis. Além disso, a oxidação do HMF leva ao ácido 
2,5-furanodicarboxílico (FDCA) potencial substituto para o ácido tereftálico (TA), proveniente 
do petróleo, intensamente utilizado na produção de polímeros, tais como, o poli(tereftalato de 
etileno) (PET). A substituição do TA por materiais obtidos a partir de fontes renováveis é de 
grande interesse do ponto de vista de obtenção de produtos com elevado grau de sustentabilidade.

The production of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) from sugars dehydration is an alternative 
for obtaining starting materials for the production of polyesters, polyamides and polyurethanes, due 
to the development of the new materials not derived from petroleum. Moreover, by oxidizing the 
HMF, the 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) can be obtained, which can replace the terephthalic 
acid (TA) (from petroleum) in the polymers production as poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET). 
The replacement of TA with materials derived from renewable sources is of great interest from 
an environmental and sustainable point of view.

Keywords: 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, dehydration, fructose, glucose, HMF

Introduction

Since the end of the 20th century the interest in the 
use of raw materials from renewable resources for the 
production of a variety of petrochemical intermediates 
has been growing in order to develop the replacement of 
petroleum as a source of raw materials and energy. Such 
techniques enabling the achievement of alternative sources 
will gradually be available for industrial application, 
depending on economic interests, social and availability 
of appropriate technologies.1-3 Several product classes are 
promising natural substitutes of petroleum derivatives, 
the biomass being the first one obtained from renewable 
sources. Among all biomass, carbohydrates represent 
more than 75%, therefore the interest to convert them into 
fine chemicals is increasing and could represent a real 
alternative to non renewable sources.4-7 

Currently the sustainable industrial conversion of 
biomass still depends on the development of specific 
technologies involving processes for biomass conversion 
related to equipment for producing fuels, chemical 
products and energy.1,4,8,9 An example of this is the 
obtainment of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), see 
structure in Figure 1, and furfural from cellulose or other 
carbohydrates as glucose, fructose and starch. A lot of 
renewable intermediates obtainable from biomass enable 
the production of green polymers or are precursors for the 
production of fuel, diesel or jet fuel.10-13

substitute the terephthalic acid (TA) in PET production 
or isophthalic acids in the manufacture of polyamides, 
polyesters and polyurethanes. The replacement of TA by 
FDCA constitutes an important step for sustainable processes 
development, thus FDCA production could represent a huge 
market. Nowadays polyurethanes using FDCA are already 
manufactured industrially for several applications.1,14-16

The synthesis of HMF, shown in Scheme 1, comprises 
many problems, especially those associated with the 
formation of byproducts through parallel reactions. The 
formation of secondary products as levulinic acid (LA) 
and formic acid (FA) influence the overall efficiency of the 
process, as well as formation of humins polymers which 
is the main cause of low HMF yields reported in most of 
studies available in this area.11,17,18

HMF produced with low yield and the high cost 
of industrial production are the factors that limit its 
availability. Some processes described in the literature 
produce HMF using acid catalysts for the conversion of 
fructose as substrate. However, the disadvantage in the 
use of these catalysts is that secondary reactions usually 
occur, burdening the process by the loss of material and 
the necessity of purifying the product. Moreover, HMF 
decomposes under acidic conditions in water.19 

When using glucose as substrate, the situation is more 
critical due to the low HMF yield and the production of 
larger amounts of byproducts. Using glucose implies the 
isomerization into fructose by selective methods, leading 
to an increase in yield of the desired final product.18 

Different catalysts are employed for the synthesis of 
HMF, such as, ion exchange resins,20-22 minerals and organic 
acids,23-25 zeolites6,26 and oxides.27 These catalytic systems, 
besides producing HMF with low yields and forming 
byproducts, high temperatures and longer reaction times 
are usually required.28

Solid acid catalysts such as SO4
2–/ZrO2-Al2O3 present 

strong acidity and were used in the conversion of glucose and 

fructose to HMF yielding 47.6% and 68.2%, respectively 
in 4 h at 130 ºC. Nb2O5 catalyst (calcined at 400 ºC) was 
effective for the production of HMF due to its Lewis acid 
sites. This catalyst showed a total fructose conversion with 
86.2% HMF yield (2 h reaction at 120 ºC).27,29

Qi et al.20 studied the catalytic dehydration of fructose 
into HMF using microwave heating and a solvent media 
composed by acetone-water, the catalyst being a strong acid 
cation exchange resin (Dowex 50wx8-100) that is insoluble 
in water. Yields of 73.4% for 5-HMF and a conversion of 
94% at 150 ºC were obtained. The resin showed a good 
stability at high temperatures enabling its reuse 5 times 
without observing catalytic activity decrease. 

An efficient strategy for the direct production of HMF 
from glucose and cellulose (from ligninocellulose) was 
proposed using ionic liquids (ILs) based in imidazolium 
in the presence of CrCl3 by microwave radiations, yields 
behind 60-90% were obtained. This reaction was considered 
a significant advance in the use of ligninocellulose for the 
production of carbohydrates via a green process.30 The use 
ILs, besides leading to satisfactory results, provides an 
environmental alternative process where volatile organic 
solvents are substituted representing an attracted interest 
in different areas.31 

Hu et al. proposed a mechanism employing SnCl4 as 
catalyst for the glucose to HMF conversion in IL, 1-ethyl-3-
methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMI.BF4), where the 
Sn+4 center interacts with a acyclic and five or six member 
ring intermediates.32 Zhao et al.19 studied an alternative 
system, for which dehydration takes place more easily as 
the metallic halides catalyst (CrCl2, CrCl3, FeCl2, FeCl3, 
CuCl, CuCl2, VCl3, MoCl3, PdCl2, PtCl2, PtCl4 or RuCl3) 
is dissolved in the IL. With this method HMF is obtained 
in high yields (63 to 83%) and secondary reactions are 
minimized (for example, levulinic acid formation is 0.08%). 
Among the catalysts tested the highest HMF yield was 
achieved using CrCl2 which reaches values   around 70%.

Sidhpuria et al. used nanoparticles immobilized in ILs in 
the dehydration of fructose obtaining 63% HMF yield.32,33

Another alternative is employing an IL as catalyst and 
solvent. For example, the use of 1-H-3-methylimidazolium 
chloride (HMI.Cl) in the dehydration of fructose produced 
HMF with a yield of 92% after 45 minutes of reaction time. 
When this catalytic system was used with sucrose, a rapid 
cleavage of sucrose into fructose and glucose was observed. 
The fructose was then transformed quickly into HMF with 
high yield and without the formation of byproducts and on 
the other hand at the same time, only 3% of the glucose was 
converted in HMF. The low transformation of glucose is 
due the necessity of its previous isomerization into fructose 
before the dehydration reaction to produce HMF.34,35 

Furans produced from carbohydrates have high 
potential for the synthesis of monomers and then polymeric 
materials based on renewable sources. They can be obtained 
by synthesis which provides high yields and low production 
costs, but still should be investigated in order to optimize 
the process. A prime example is the use of ILs based on 
imidazolium in dehydration processes sugar (fructose or 
glucose) with satisfactory results related to the selectivity 
that can be improved in the case of the glucose and showed 
in this paper.36,37 

This study reports results of HMF synthesis from 
dehydration of fructose or glucose using imidazolium based 
ILs as solvent and acid catalyst.

were prepared to methods previously described (Figure 2 
(n = 4-16)).38,39

Synthesis of HMF

All the dehydration reaction experiments were 
performed in a 50 mL flask equipped with magnetic stirrer. 

Were charged into the flask ionic liquid (4 g), fructose or 
glucose (0.4 g) and HCl acid (9%) (wt.%). The reaction 
system was placed in an oil bath adjusted to a range of 
80 to 120 °C (according IL melting point), during 8 or 
12 minutes.40 After reaction time, the reaction mixture 
was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC) equipped with UV and refractive index detectors. 

The HPLC measurements are conducted using a 
Shimadzu LC-20AD with UV and refractive index detector. 
The column Aminex HPX-87H (300 mm × 7.8 mm) is 
employed to separate the reaction mixture. General 
HPLC conditions for analysis of sugars conversion and 
HMF yield: refractive index detector; column temperature: 
65 ºC; eluent: 0.6 mL min–1 H2SO4 pH 2; injection

HMF was determined by using calibration curves. 
Analysis chromatogram of a standard solution containing 
glucose, fructose and HMF by HPLC are shown in

above 85%) than glucose (yields about 30%). The acid 
dissolved in the ILs is very selective in HMF formation 
(&gt; 85%). The same performances are not observed when 
tests are performed with glucose as substrate. The poor 
conversion of glucose is linked to the need to isomerize 
glucose to fructose for subsequent dehydration, as described 
in literature.40,42 

Figure 4 and 5 repeat data of Table 1 evidencing the 
effect of the alkyl chain lengh of the ILs in dehydration of 
frutose and glucose respectively. The modification of ILs 
nature leads to considerable difference in selectivity and 
yield data for fructose reaction when the reaction time is 
12 minutes, but not for 8 minutes reaction time (Figure 4). 
This results can indicate that with a higher reaction time 
decomposition of HMF occurs and ILs with a longer alkyl 
chain avoid the formation of byproducts (compare in 
Table 1, HMF selectivity in reaction 2 with reactions 6, 10 
and 14). About the glucose reaction (Figure 5), conversion 
is observed only when C12MI.Cl and C16MI.Cl are employed 
and attains high value (ca. 80%), but the corresponding 
HMF selectivities and yields remain low (&amp;lt;50%). 

Relating to fructose as substrate, when using C4MI.
Cl at 80 °C, after 8 minutes, the yield is 91% (Table 1, 
reaction 1) and is reduced to 70% (Table 1, reaction 2)  

after 12 minutes of reaction time. This result indicates 
that the reaction is completed rapidly and that HMF 
decomposition occurs subsequently generating byproducts 
and decreasing the yield. In this IL (C4MI.Cl), HMF 
is not formed by dehydration of glucose (Table 1, 
reactions 3 and 4). The same occurs when C8MI.Cl 
(Table 1, reactions 7 and 8) and C10MI.Cl (Table 1, 
reactions 11 and 12) are employed.

When C12MI.Cl is used in the fructose dehydration, 
(Table 1, reactions 13 and 14) the yield increases from 89% 
to 96% corresponding to 8 and 12 minutes respectively, 
indicating that after 8 minutes the reaction was not finished. 
For glucose (Table 1, reactions 15 and 16), the increase 
of the time reaction also leads to increasing the yield, but 
this one remains low (34%). This low yield obtained for 
glucose is not improved by the use of C16MI.Cl (Table 1, 
reactions 19 and 20). These low yields related to glucose 
indicate that its isomerization in this environment does not 
occur, probably due to the stability of its ring structure.33 

Results of reactions 17 and 18 in Table 1, where 
fructose and C16MI.Cl are used, show that the change of 
the reaction time from 8 to 12 minutes does not affect the 
catalytic properties evidencing that no decomposition of 
HMF occurs as no byproducts are observed. 

The set of these results show that, independently of 
IL used in this study, high HMF yields are obtained from 
dehydration of fructose in a relatively short reaction time 
(8 minutes). These results corroborate those described in 
the literature.40,42 

Scheme 2 shows a proposal for mechanism dehydration 
of fructose catalyzed by acid such as the systems developed 
in this work. Antal43 and Newth44 suggest that the formation 
of HMF easily occurs from fructose by cyclic intermediate 
enol, 2,5-anhydro-D-mannose, formed in tautomerization 
step.42 In this mechanism dehydration of fructose is initiated 
by protonation of the most basic hydroxyl group of the 
molecule that directly attached to the ring in a position 

alpha to the oxygen. The protonated form leading to 
spontaneous dehydration generates the intermediate enol 
that rearranges and then loses another water molecule, 
followed by deprotonation regenerating the catalyst and 
eliminating HMF.

It isn’t surprising that the IL/HCl system catalyzed 
the dehydration of frutose due to the high acidity of the 
medium, as mechanism proposed, but also ensures the 
phase separation, in particular in the case of BMI.Cl IL, due 
to the lipophilic character coming from the chain length of 
the imidazolium ring. Balance of these different properties 
provides the best systems for avoiding decomposition of 
HMF from frutose and the conversion of glucose. In this 

Figure 5. Effect of ILs in the dehydration of glucose.

Scheme 2. Mechanism of fructose dehydration.



Melo et al. 2383Vol. 25, No. 12, 2014

case ILs C12MI.Cl and C16MI.Cl correspond to the best 
systems. 

Conclusions

This work shows that the catalyst system used, CnMI.
Cl (n = 4, 8, 10, 12 and 16) and HCl is efficient to produce 
HMF from fructose with yields higher than 90%. This did 
not occur when glucose is used as starting material, showing 
that this catalyst system has a low capacity to isomerize 
glucose to fructose, substance which would subsequently 
be dehydrated to obtain HMF. ILs C12MI.Cl and C16MI.
Cl were the most effective for formation of HMF from 
glucose. Further studies of other catalytic systems are being 
conducted with the aim of improving the HMF yields when 
glucose is used as substrate.
