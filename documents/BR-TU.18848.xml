Resumo 

 

Apresenta-se um estudo sobre o comportamento de fundações de barragens de betão na fase 

de exploração normal das obras desenvolvido com o objectivo de validar e fundamentar a 

aplicação de modelos numéricos de análise do comportamento hidromecânico de maciços 

rochosos, tendo em vista generalizar a sua utilização e tornar mais eficaz a observação e 

controlo de segurança destas obras.  

Foi estudada a representação em modelos numéricos da cortina de impermeabilização e do 

sistema de drenagem e das condições geológico-geotécnicas concretas das zonas de fundação 

analisadas, tendo em conta, nomeadamente, os problemas computacionais associados a 

modelos tridimensionais. Foram realizados ensaios de afluência de água em duas grandes 

barragens portuguesas, uma gravidade e uma abóbada, que se verificou serem fundamentais 

para caracterizar o escoamento no maciço, complementando a informação obtida com o 

sistema de observação. Desenvolveram-se modelos hidráulicos e hidromecânicos do 

comportamento das fundações destas barragens, que no caso da barragem gravidade foram 

utilizados no estudo de cenários de rotura.  

Apresentam-se conclusões sobre a adequação e limitação dos modelos numéricos utilizados, 

sobre os parâmetros essenciais para calibrar e aplicar esses modelos, e propõem-se métodos 

de planeamento e utilização dos sistemas de observação de fundações de barragens, de modo 

a melhorar o controlo de segurança. 

 

Palavras chave: barragens de betão; fundações rochosas; ensaios de afluência de água; 

modelação numérica; comportamento hidromecânico; controlo/avaliação da segurança.

Title: Hydromechanical behaviour of concrete dam foundations. In situ tests and numerical 

modelling  

 

 

Abstract 

 

A study on the behaviour of concrete dam foundations in normal operating conditions was 

carried out with a view to validating and justifying the application of numerical models of 

hydromechanical analysis of rock masses, so that their use may become effective to make the 

analysis of the monitoring data and safety control of these structures more efficient.  

Appropriate ways to model both grout curtains and drainage systems were analysed, as well 

as ways to represent the geological and geotechnical conditions of the foundation areas 

studied, namely taking into account the computational difficulties of three-dimensional 

models. In situ tests were carried out in two large Portuguese concrete dams, one gravity and 

one arch, which proved to be essential to provide detailed information on the hydraulic 

activity in the foundation, supplementing the available monitoring data. Hydraulic and 

hydromechanical models of both dams’ foundation behaviour were developed, and used in the 

analysis of failure scenarios in the case of the gravity dam. 

Conclusions are drawn about the suitability and limitations of the numerical models 

developed and the key parameters necessary to calibrate and use these models. Methods to 

design and use the foundation monitoring systems are proposed, for improvement of safety 

assessment. 

 

 

Keywords: concrete dams; rock foundations; borehole water-inflow tests; numerical 

modelling; hydromechanical behaviour; safety assessment.

1 Introduction 

For centuries dams have been constructed all over the world to perform a variety of functions 

such as flood control, irrigation and water supply, hydropower production, protection of 

estuaries against flooding tides and improvement of navigation along rivers. Moreover, 

reservoirs are nowadays increasingly used for recreation, which can attract tourists and thus 

benefit the local economy. In spite of this, however, the future of dams is currently the subject 

of much debate, as a large number of people claim that dams are damaging the environment 

and that their construction has undesirable social effects.  

The fact that a large number of dams are a source of renewable energy, which is generated 

without polluting the atmosphere, is a major advantage in meeting increasing electricity 

needs. Hydroelectricity today provides almost 20 % of the world’s power, and although other 

renewable energy sources, such as solar and eolic energy, have potential for increased use, 

they also have limiting characteristics as they can not provide the continuous, reliable supply 

which is needed. Therefore, multipurpose developments, which include more than one dam 

and in which the water may be pumped from a downstream to an upstream reservoir in the 

hours of lower power consumption are increasingly being built to fulfil this necessity. 

In European countries such as Spain, Italy and Portugal, a significant period of construction of 

concrete dams took place in the 1950s along with the economic recovery that followed the 

end of the 2nd World War, and the main emphasis was on the exploitation of hydroelectric 

resources for local economic development. Several concrete dams were also built during the 

1980s in Portugal, and indeed at present the trend is for increasing construction. Four 20-35 m 

high concrete dams were built in Portugal in the last three years (Fumadinha, Ferradosa, 

Olgas and Pretarouca dams), there are currently two large dams under construction (Baixo 

Sabor dams), and the tender for the construction of three more dams has recently been opened 

(new Alto Ceira dam, Ribeiradio and Ermida dams). The first four were constructed for water 

supply, while the others are mainly for energy production. In addition, in 2007, the 

Portuguese Water Institute (INAG – Instituto da Água) launched the “National Programme 

for Dams with High Hydroelectric Potential” with the aim of identifying and defining 

priorities for investments in hydroelectric developments until 2020, to increase the national 

hydroelectric capacity from the current 5000 MW up to 7000 MW, in order to decrease 

energy dependency and reduce the carbon dioxide emissions. Thanks to this programme, eight 

large dams will be built, mainly for energy production (Foz Tua, Padroselos, Alto Tâmega, 

Daivões, Gouvães, Fridão, Alvito and Girabolhos dams), only one of which is less than 70 m 

high.

1.1 The role of the foundation in the safety of concrete dams 

Concrete dams are built with their foundations in rock masses, which are discontinuous and, 

in most cases, heterogeneous and anisotropic. Accidents at Malpasset dam, in France in 1959, 

and Vajont, in Italy in 1963, among others, highlighted the significance of the characteristics 

of these rock masses. In fact, the foundation rock mass is part of a structural system which 

includes the dam, the foundation and the reservoir, and is a crucial element when considering 

safety, as can be concluded from the results of various statistical studies of dam deterioration 

carried out by the International Commission on Large Dams (ICOLD). 

The identification and analysis, on a worldwide scale, of the main accident and incident 

scenarios that have taken place in concrete, masonry and embankment dams, has been the 

subject of study of numerous working groups, among which the studies carried out by several 

ICOLD committees are highlighted. In order to get the largest amount of information possible 

about accidents and/or incidents in dams ICOLD has already sent out three questionnaires to 

which a large number of countries responded. Among the studies presented by ICOLD 

committees it is worth mentioning the following bulletins: 

? Lessons from dam incidents (ICOLD 1974); 

? Deterioration of dams and reservoirs. Examples and their analysis (ICOLD 1983); 

? Ageing of dams and appurtenant works. Review and recommendations (ICOLD 

1994); 

? Dam failures. Statistical analysis (ICOLD 1995).  

The conclusion was drawn that the main cause of accidents in concrete and embankment 

dams was overtopping due to floods greater than predicted in the design stage or due to 

operating faults of appurtenant works, followed by faulty behaviour of dam body and 

foundation. 

In concrete dams, not including issues related with the appurtenant works, the majority of 

recorded failures were due to problems in the foundation rock mass such as erosion and 

internal dissolving of rock masses, which often lead to a loss of strength, and lack of shear 

resistance in weak planes of unfavourable direction. 

The safety control of dams throughout their lifetime, which includes the phases of design, 

construction, first filling of the reservoir, operation, and decommissioning, has always been a 

major concern, especially for those structures of which the failure has the potential for loss of 

human life and economic consequences. Dams are therefore systematically equipped with a 

large number of monitoring instruments, of which the results enable the continuing evaluation 



 3 

of dam behaviour. In addition, there are nowadays, in a great number of countries, 

regulations, guidelines and codes of practice, which have been continuously updated in order 

to reduce the risk of accidents. This is the case in Portugal, where the first Regulation for the 

Safety of Dams, published in 1990, was recently revised (RSB 2007). 

The safety control of concrete dams has improved significantly in recent years, with the 

increasing use of numerical models not only in the analysis of the dam’s actual performance 

but also in the prediction of its behaviour. However, these developments have been mainly 

restricted to the study of the concrete super-structure. The great complexity of concrete dam 

foundations, not only due to the existence of discontinuities and heterogeneities but also to the 

foundation treatment necessary to improve mechanical and hydraulic properties, has always 

made both the mechanical and hydraulic characterization and the analysis of its behaviour 

difficult.  

Seepage through the rock mass in a concrete dam foundation is a crucial factor and it is well 

known that there is a significant interdependence between the mechanical and hydraulic 

behaviour. In fact, in a rock mass the majority of the flow takes place through a complex 

interconnecting system of discontinuities, whose aperture may vary with variations in stresses 

and/or strains within the foundation, due, for instance, to changes in the reservoir level. Even 

slight changes in apertures can lead to significant changes in the quantity of water flowing 

through the discontinuities. Changes in flow patterns cause changes in mechanical loads, 

which, in turn, are responsible for changes in the state of stress. A comprehensive review of 

hydromechanical couplings in fractured rock masses as a result of or directly connected with 

human activities, can be found in Rutqvist and Stephansson (2003).  

The effects of water pressures in both the dam body and its foundation were recognized in the 

late 1800s, and started to be studied in a scientific way after the concept of effective pressure 

was introduced by Terzaghi, in 1923. In dam foundations, hydromechanical behaviour began 

to receive wide attention in the early 1960s, during the investigation of the Malpasset dam 

failure. Some of the first studies on coupled hydromechanical behaviour in fractured rocks 

were related to dam foundations (Londe and Sabarly 1966; Louis 1969; Louis and Maini 

1970), and since then it has been the subject of extensive laboratory and in situ research (e.g. 

Cappa et al. 2005; 2006; Cornet et al. 2003; Giacomini et al. 2008; Kovari and Koppel 1987; 

Noorishad et al. 1992; Olsson and Barton 2001; Rutqvist et al. 1992). However, as mentioned 

in Rutqvist and Stephansson (2003), during the past two decades most of the research and 

development on hydromechanical coupling in fractured rocks and most applications of 

hydromechanical coupled analysis have been conducted as part of oil and gas exploration, 

hot-dry rock geothermal energy investigations, and studies for nuclear waste disposal. Thus, 

the application of research results to the field conditions of dam foundations is still difficult.  



   4 

Regarding the dam foundation rock mass, in particular the hydromechanical behaviour, the 

available numerical techniques are not commonly used to support the analysis of the 

monitoring data or the safety control, even though there are currently various numerical 

methods of mechanical and hydromechanical analysis of rock masses which can be 

effectively used for this purpose, which are systematically presented in Jing and Hudson 

(2002) and in Jing (2003). These may be divided into two different approaches: continuum 

and discontinuum modelling, and include different numerical techniques such as the finite 

element, finite difference and boundary element methods (FEM, FDM and BEM), in 

continuum analysis, or the discrete element method (DEM), the discontinuous deformation 

analysis (DDA) and the bonded particle method (BPM), in discontinuum analysis.  

1.2 Objectives 

The main aim of this research is to validate and justify the application of numerical models 

for the analysis of hydromechanical behaviour so that their use may become effective, in 

order to improve our ability to analyse the monitoring data of concrete dam foundations, to 

make the safety assessment of these structures more efficient. For this, it is essential to carry 

out systematic and comprehensive work to verify the computational codes, to validate the 

hypotheses assumed in the numerical codes by comparison of numerical results with both 

experimental and field data, and to develop methodologies to calibrate the model for the 

specific geological and geotechnical conditions of a given dam foundation. 

The information which is commonly available regarding the hydraulic activity in concrete 

dam foundations is the quantity of water collected in drainage systems, and water pressures 

recorded in piezometers located in the various dam blocks. Although essential for the 

assessment of both dam behaviour and safety, this information is not sufficient to develop 

accurate hydraulic models, which require the location of seepage paths to be known. In situ 

water-inflow tests are proposed, which are capable of providing more complete information 

on the foundation’s hydraulic behaviour. 

Dam performance is often assessed using statistical methods, based on previously collected 

monitoring results. These simplified methods have been regularly employed in the analysis of 

dam displacements but are seldom used in the analysis of hydraulic behaviour. An attempt is 

made to apply these methods in the analysis of drainage data. 

Concerning numerical modelling, the first studies of the hydraulic behaviour of rock masses 

used equivalent continuum models. There are more advanced discontinuum models (fracture 

flow models), which accurately simulate rock masses’ hydromechanical behaviour, however, 

these models require data which is not usually available, such as that regarding the complex 

jointing pattern or the joint hydraulic properties. One of the purposes of this study is to 



 5 

develop a methodology for the application of equivalent continuum models, which can be 

effectively used in practice, based on data that can be easily obtained from both monitoring 

and in situ tests. Although not practical to study dam’s hydraulic behaviour, discontinuum 

models are commonly used for safety evaluation, and the simpler equivalent continuum 

models can also provide relevant information to be used in these more complex models. 

Some practical issues merit further attention, mainly regarding the use of three-dimensional 

(3D) numerical models, required to accurately simulate the behaviour of dam foundations, 

especially arch dams. Large 3D global models of dam foundations are not feasible without 

simplified representations of both the grout and drainage systems, which have to be properly 

addressed and justified. It is necessary to develop, test and validate this type of model, which 

must not only simulate flow correctly, but also be computationally efficient.  

1.3 Thesis outline 

The thesis is composed of eight chapters. In this chapter 1 the role of the foundation in the 

safety of concrete dams is highlighted, the subject’s relevance is justified and the main aims 

of the thesis are presented. 

Chapter 2 focuses on the behaviour and analysis of concrete dam foundations. It starts by 

describing main aspects related to rock mass characterization, fluid flow through rock mass 

discontinuities, and hydromechanical behaviour of rock joints. The specific features of 

concrete dam foundations are presented, namely the sealing and drainage treatment measures, 

and the influence that both grout and drainage systems have on the foundation’s hydraulic 

activity is highlighted. The main cases of foundation deterioration observed in Portugal are 

briefly referred to. A review of previous studies is presented along with a reference to the 

main numerical methods available to simulate or interpret the hydromechanical behaviour of 

dam foundations. The factors that influence the choice between equivalent continuum and 

discontinuous models are outlined and the fundamentals of fluid flow in either continuum or 

discontinuum media are presented. Finally, a reference is made to the numerical codes used in 

this study. 

Chapter 3 addresses the observation and analysis of concrete dam foundation behaviour. A 

reference is made to: i) the measures usually taken to fulfil both safety and serviceability 

requirements; ii) the monitoring equipment to measure the main loads, the factors which 

define seepage in the foundation (uplift and discharges) and those which must be known to 

define the states of stress and strain of the foundation rock mass (displacements, strains and 

stresses); and iii) the methodologies currently used in the collecting and collating of the 

monitoring data. Simplified methods, such as quantitative interpretation, are traditionally used 

to interpret recorded data and thus a brief review of these methods is presented. However, due 



   6 

to the non-linear behaviour of the foundation rock mass the principle of superposition of 

effects is not valid, making the application of these methods in the analysis of recorded 

discharges and water pressures difficult. A method is proposed for the analysis of the recorded 

discharges which takes into account the non-linear hydromechanical behaviour, due to the 

influence of stress and strain on the permeability. 

The study carried out included a series of field tests, which proved to be essential to provide 

detailed information on the hydraulic activity in the foundation rock mass, supplementing the 

available monitoring data. Tests were carried out with a view to understanding the way in 

which flow occurs in specific areas of the foundation and validating numerical models so that 

their use may become effective. Borehole water-inflow tests, which allow measurement of 

discharges and water pressures in isolated sections of boreholes, were conducted in the 

foundation of two large Portuguese concrete dams, one gravity and one arch. As there are no 

pre-established testing methods, these were developed within this study to provide 

information which can be useful in the analysis and safety assessment of any dam foundation. 

Chapter 4 presents a thorough description of these tests, the main characteristics of the dams 

where tests were carried out, with emphasis on those related with the foundation, and analysis 

of tests results. Additional tests were carried out and despite some difficulties found whilst 

testing in situ, which are pointed out in order to be avoided in future studies, the tests 

provided valuable information without which the hydraulic and hydromechanical models 

presented in the subsequent chapters could not have been developed.  

Although rock masses are discontinuous structures, the most widely used tool to study the 

hydraulic behaviour of concrete dam foundations are models based on the assumption of an 

equivalent continuum medium. Chapter 5 starts by presenting validation tests of two of the 

numerical codes used in this study in hydraulic analysis against analytical solutions. 

Conclusions drawn from these tests regarding the representation of the drain and suitable 

mesh sizes in the study of seepage flow provided the basis to develop a three dimensional 

model of a restricted area of the foundation of one of the dams where borehole water-inflow 

tests were carried out, and this 3D model was used to study the influence of different factors, 

such as the influence of drainage, boundary conditions, grout curtain permeability, model size 

and mesh size. The flow in fractured rock masses is mainly three-dimensional but 2D models 

can sometimes be used, with the advantage of being much simpler, and therefore results of 2D 

and 3D models were compared. 

Conclusions drawn in chapter 5 were essential to develop and justify the application of both 

2D and 3D models presented in chapters 6 and 7, in which two case studies of Portuguese 

dams are examined. In both chapters, the validity of the used numerical models of the dam-

foundation structural system is assessed by comparing the numerical results to the monitoring 



 7 

data and special attention is given to the foundation’s hydraulic and hydromechanical 

behaviour.  

The study presented in chapter 6 included the development of a series of numerical models to 

simulate the hydraulic and hydromechanical behaviour of the studied arch dam foundation, 

which were progressively validated and calibrated against field data. Borehole water-inflow 

tests were simulated, and the knowledge of both seepage patterns around particular boreholes 

and of the key parameters was essential to develop an effective application of a simplified 

global model of the dam foundation, which provided a good match of both average recorded 

discharges and water pressures. Global hydraulic models of dam foundations are useful not 

only for the assessment of the behaviour of operating dams but also to determine water 

pressure distributions for safety analysis. A simple methodology was developed, which, with 

an uncoupled mechanical-hydraulic analysis, can be used to establish rules that allow the 

calculation of discharges for different reservoir levels.  

Chapter 7 links analysis of seepage and hydromechanical behaviour of the studied gravity 

dam foundation with stability assessment. Borehole water-inflow test results were again of 

major importance in the development of numerical models which properly simulate dam 

behaviour. Both two-dimensional equivalent continuum and discontinuum models were 

developed, and the latter was used to assess water pressures within the foundation and to 

evaluate the safety for different possible failure scenarios involving either the foundation or 

the dam body.  

In the last chapter, a critical discussion of the results obtained and a summary of the main 

conclusions are presented. Conclusions are drawn about the suitability and limitations of the 

numerical models developed to interpret and forecast the behaviour of the foundation rock 

masses and the key parameters necessary to calibrate and use these models. Methods to design 

and use the foundation monitoring systems are proposed, for improvement of safety 

assessment. Finally, suggestions for further research are proposed.

2 Concrete dam foundations. Hydromechanical behaviour and 
analysis 

2.1 Introduction 

The mechanical and hydraulic processes in rock masses are not independent. Fluid flow 

influences the mechanical behaviour since changes in water flow cause variations in seepage 

forces and in hydraulic uplift. These mechanical loads change the stress field, thus inducing 

deformations in the fractured rock mass. These deformations, in turn, cause changes in 

permeability and consequently changes in water flow. This is called a coupled 

hydromechanical process and the coupling mechanisms are between the fracture aperture, 

rock porosity/permeability, fluid pressure and rock stress (Jing and Stephansson 2007). 

This chapter focuses on the behaviour and analysis of concrete dam foundations. It starts by 

describing main aspects related to rock mass characterization, followed by a summary of the 

governing equations both in continuum media and through rock mass discontinuities. The 

main aspects related to hydromechanical behaviour of rock joints are referred to. The specific 

features of concrete dam foundations are presented, namely the sealing and drainage treatment 

measures, and the influence that both grout and drainage systems have on the foundation’s 

hydraulic activity is highlighted. The main cases of foundation deterioration observed in 

Portugal are briefly referred to. A review of previous studies is presented along with a 

reference to the main numerical methods available to simulate or interpret the 

hydromechanical behaviour of dam foundations. Finally, a reference is made to the numerical 

codes used in this study. 

2.2 Characterization of rock masses 

The foundation of any dam is always a complex structure that requires a well designed and 

comprehensive site and laboratory investigation programme. The results of this investigation 

should provide sufficient knowledge of the foundation to help and justify the design of both 

the super-structure and the foundation treatment, and to predict the response of the foundation 

to the physical conditions that are going to be imposed by dam construction and subsequent 

loading. There is extensive literature on characterization of rock masses, which includes 

geological, geotechnical and foundation materials investigations (e.g. Hudson and Cosgrove 

1997; ICOLD 2005; ISRM 2007; USACE 1984) so only the most relevant matters for the 

study presented here are addressed below. 

Laboratory and in situ tests are carried out in order to characterize strength, deformability, 

state of stress and hydraulic properties. The size of the samples tested in the laboratory is not 

usually large enough to be representative of the rock mass with regard to heterogeneity and 



   10 

jointing. In most cases, there is also a scale effect, which makes it difficult to use laboratory 

data to estimate the properties of fractured rock masses. In situ tests are often required but 

they typically involve a small area of the foundation and thus the results may not be 

representative. Therefore, despite all the investigation carried out prior to and during dam 

construction, it is well acknowledged and should always be kept in mind that the foundation 

geology, geomechanics and hydromechanical behaviour can never be fully known.   

2.2.1 Geological and hydrogeological investigations 

Mapping of the foundation surface geology is the first activity undertaken to acquire a basic 

knowledge of the geology. Different types of surface geological maps may be drawn, 

depending on the information required, but they should employ engineering rock description 

terms in order to be useful for engineering practice. ICOLD (2005) highlights that the map 

must emphasize features that are relevant to the identification of geological concerns affecting 

design, project safety and performance. In this regard, the identification of discontinuities 

(including measurement and orientation), such as faults, joints and bedding planes, is essential 

for geological mapping, because discontinuities usually govern the performance of the rock 

mass. Geological cross-sections along and perpendicular to the dam axis are also of major 

importance. 

Among the various guides that have been suggested to prepare geological maps, which give 

the terminology and symbols to be used, are those presented by the International Society for 

Rock Mechanics (ISRM 1978, 1981). The first document suggests methods for the 

quantitative description of rock masses and discontinuities, and the second provides 

qualitative and quantitative descriptive elements for characterizing the mechanical behaviour 

of rock masses. In the latter, five characteristics are taken into account: the rock name, with a 

simplified geological description; two structural characteristics of the rock mass: layer 

thickness and fracture intercept; and two mechanical characteristics: the uniaxial compressive 

strength (UCS) of the rock material and the angle of friction of the fractures. The simplified 

geological description should include a reference to: i) the geological structure of the rock 

mass; ii) the fracturing of the rock mass; iii) colour, texture and mineral composition of the 

rock material; and iv) the degree of weathering. Figure 2.1 shows the five different intervals 

within which each one of the characteristics is described. The terms and symbols used to 

classify the degree of weathering are shown in Figure 2.2. 

Regarding hydrogeological investigations it is not only important to understand the 

groundwater conditions prior to dam construction, but also to identify springs and seepages 

that occur in the dam area. Springs that appear during excavation should be treated and the 

water properly diverted to the downstream area. One of the most important hydrogeological 

parameters is the permeability of the rock mass, which is controlled by the characteristics of 



 11 

the discontinuities, because their permeability is usually several orders higher than that of the 

unweathered rock.

Although rock masses are fissured media, the groundwater flow is usually studied assuming a 

porous media conceptual model, and is therefore governed by Darcy’s law. The results of a 

series of laboratory experiments conducted by Henry Darcy to study flows of water in vertical 

homogeneous sand filters, the results of which he published in 1856, indicated that, 

macroscopically, the velocity of a fluid through porous media is directly proportional to the 

pressure gradient acting on the fluid:  

ik
H

?v  (2.1) 

or, since  the discharge per unit time (rate of discharge or flow rate) is given by q = v A 

Aikq
H

?  (2.2) 

The quantity of discharge in a period of time equal to t is given by:  

tAikQ
H

?  (2.3) 

In the previous equations: v = discharge velocity (m/s); kH = Darcy’s coefficient of 

permeability or hydraulic conductivity (m/s); i = hydraulic gradient (head loss / length over 

which head loss occurs (m/m)); q = rate of discharge (discharge on a unit time (m
3
/s)); 

A = cross-sectional area of flow (m
2
); Q = quantity of discharge (m

3
); t = time of flow (s). 

Darcy’s law only applies to linear flow (adjacent flow lines are locally straight and parallel), 

thus for high seepage velocities, Darcy’s law does not hold. The upper limit on the range of 

validity of Darcy’s law is given by the Reynolds number (Re), a dimensionless number which, 

in steady-state conditions, expresses the ratio of inertial to viscous (frictional) forces during 

flow. 

Darcy’s coefficient of permeability, also known as hydraulic conductivity or simply 

permeability is expressed as a velocity and is usually given in m/s. In fact, the “hydraulic 

conductivity” is a measure of permeability that includes both the properties of the medium 

and of the fluid (i.e. density (?) and viscosity (?), or, in the combined form of kinematic 

viscosity (? = ?/?)), while “permeability” is an intrinsic property of the medium that is 

independent of the properties of any fluid (usually expressed in cm
2
 or Darcys). Permeability 

(k) can be converted to hydraulic conductivity (kH) with knowledge of the fluid properties: 

??

?

?

? gk
k

g
kk

H
???  

(2.4) 

where ? = unit weight of the fluid; ? = dynamic viscosity of the fluid; ? = fluid density; 

g = gravity acceleration; and ? = kinematic viscosity of the fluid. In practice, however, the 



 13 

term permeability is often used instead of hydraulic conductivity. Permeability calculated on 

the basis of Darcy’s law is limited to the conditions of laminar flow and complete saturation 

of the media. When equivalent continuum models are used to study flow in dam foundation 

rock masses, permeability should be referred to as equivalent permeability. 

The hydraulic conductivity of concrete dam foundation rock masses is commonly evaluated 

with constant-head tests, known as “Lugeon type tests” (Houlsby 1976). These tests are 

systematically carried out i) during geological investigations, ii) when drilling grout and 

drainage boreholes, and, iii) with the dam already built, when opening piezometric holes. 

During geological investigations the results of these tests give important data which is used in 

the design of seepage control measures. During the initial phase of dam use, structural weight 

and hydrostatic loads acting simultaneously lead to great stress changes in the rock mass, with 

a consequent change in joint apertures and fluid flow. The repetition of these tests in drains 

and piezometric holes during the structure’s lifetime can allow the detection of seepage 

changes. 

The well known Lugeon test was originally proposed by Maurice Lugeon, in order to 

establish a simple empirical criterion to design grouting in dam foundations (Lugeon 1932), 

and since then it has been widely used to estimate the permeability of rock masses. The test 

involves isolating a section of a borehole with the aid of packers and injecting water under 

pressure into that section until the flow rate for any given pressure is constant. The original 

test was conducted at a pressure of 1 MPa (10 bar), and the results were expressed in Lugeon 

units (LU), 1 LU being defined as the water take of 1 litre / minute per metre length of test 

section, at an effective pressure of 1 MPa (Houlsby 1976). Over the years several changes 

have been suggested to improve the tests, such as adapting the test interval length to the joint 

pattern of the rock mass, considering various pressure stages; and adapting pressure values to 

the rock mass characteristics, the test depth, and the maximum water pressures expected 

during the dam’s lifetime. 

Injection tests in boreholes lead to scalar values of hydraulic conductivity. However, the rock 

mass permeability can be highly anisotropic and the differences in the permeability in 

different directions can be of various orders (Rocha and Franciss 1977). To take into account 

the anisotropy in the rock mass permeability, i.e. to determine its hydraulic conductivity 

tensor (or permeability tensor), various methods have been proposed by different authors (e.g. 

Louis 1969; Serafim and Del Campo 1965; Snow 1965). Rocha and Franciss (1977) 

suggested a method that had the great advantage, compared to the previously devised 

methods, of allowing the determination of the permeability tensor at a point from a single 

integral sample, provided it was representative of the fracturing. However, Wittke (1990) is of 

the opinion that this method is only a supplementary method to determine permeability, as 

integral samples have small dimensions and are rarely representative of permeability. Wang et 



   14 

al. (2002) presented a new methodology based on the numerical simulation of a few hydraulic 

tests carried out in situ, using a discrete fracture flow model. Despite these attempts, Lugeon 

type tests remain the most widely used tool to evaluate the equivalent permeability of 

concrete dam foundations. 

Permeability values can be expressed either in Lugeon units or in m/s. This allows the 

comparison of the permeability of a heterogeneous and fractured rock mass with that of a 

homogeneous medium which has the same water take at a pressure of 10 bar. It is usually 

assumed that 1 LU is equivalent to 1.3 × 10
-7

 m/s, or more frequently simply to 1.0 × 10
-7

 m/s 

(Fell et al. 2005; Houlsby 1976; Lancaster-Jones 1975; Wyllie 1999). This value may be 

obtained using the solution for steady-state laminar flow in homogeneous and isotropic media 

around a test well. Hvorslev and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, in 1951, Moye, in 1967, 

and Hoek and Bray, in 1981, suggested the use of different formulas for analysis of water 

pressure tests (Bulut et al. 1996; Hoek and Bray 1981; Hvorslev 1951; Moye 1967). Hamm et 

al. (2007) show that the equations suggested by the first two above-mentioned authors are 

mathematically the same, and that those suggested by the last two (Table 2.1) are simplified 

cases of the Hvorslev formula.  

Lugeon type tests are usually carried out in 5.0 m long test sections in boreholes with a 

diameter of 76 mm. In this case, according to Moye’s formula 1 LU is equivalent to 

1.4 × 10
-7

 m/s. Hoek and Bray (1981) suggest that for most applications the ratio between the 

equivalent permeability perpendicular to the borehole and that in the parallel direction (kr/kz) 

is about 10
6
. This implies that there are no fractures parallel to the hole, and in most rock 

masses this would not be a reasonable approximation (Fell et al. 2005). If it is assumed that 

kr/kz = 10 then 1 LU is equivalent to 1.6 × 10
-7

 m/s. In homogeneous isotropic conditions 

kr = kz and thus m = (kr/kz)
1/2

 = 1, and 1 LU is equivalent to 1.3 × 10
-7

 m/s.

2.2.2 Geotechnical investigations 

Field investigations include the collecting of information from test pits and trenches (and if 

necessary from adits and shafts), examination of cored boreholes, and various tests carried out 

in order to evaluate: i) the permeability and the deformability of the different areas of the dam 

foundation, ii) the shear strength parameters of intact rock and discontinuities, and iii) the in 

situ state of stress. The different methods for investigating dam foundation rock masses are 

presented in detail in ICOLD (1993). It is important to highlight that the majority of the tests 

involve relatively small volumes of the rock mass and thus test results must be carefully 

analysed and interpreted in order to give useful information for both dam design and analysis 

of dam foundation performance. 

Empirical rock mass classification systems for engineering purposes have been developed, 

such as the RMR (rock mass rating) system of Bieniawski and the Q (or NGI) system of 

Barton. These systems were originally established for the design of tunnels. Although 

extensions of the RMR have been proposed to cover the case of dam foundations and slopes 

(e.g. Romana 2004), their use in dam foundations is rare. In this respect, however, the 

percentage of core recovery, employed to classify cored boreholes, is a basic index of the 

quality of the rock mass which is extensively used. 

Laboratory investigations include rock classification tests, such as saturation water content, 

bulk density and porosity; the stress-strain and strength properties of intact rock; and the 

deformation and strength properties of rock joints. Tests can also be carried out to measure 

the hydraulic conductivity of both rock joints and intact rock. 

2.3 Fundamentals of fluid flow in continuum media 

In the majority of the analyses presented in this study it is assumed that flow takes place in an 

equivalent continuum media under steady-state conditions, thus the fundamental equations 

which describe flow under these conditions are presented below.  

2.3.1 Hydraulic head and hydraulic gradient 

Water moves from areas of higher energy to areas of lower energy. The total energy of a fluid 

element with a unit weight is given by (Louis 1969): 

g

p
zE

2

v

???

where: z = distance from some arbitrary datum [L]; p = fluid pressure at a certain point M

]; ? = unit (or specific) weight of the fluid [L
-2

 M T
-2

]; v = velocity of the fluid at M 

[L T
-1

]; and g = acceleration due to gravity [L T
-2

].  

The total energy per unit weight [L] can be divided in two parts:  

i) total head 

?
?

p
z ??  

(2.6) 

ii) velocity head 

g2

v
2

 
(2.7) 

The total head, ?, also known as piezometric head, as hydraulic potential, as hydraulic head, 

or simply head, is usually represented by h. According to Equation 2.6 the total head is the 

sum of the elevation head (distance from some arbitrary datum) and the pressure head (fluid 

pressure divided by the unit weight of the fluid). The pressure head represents the height of a 

fluid column capable, by its weight, of imposing pressure p. The velocity head represents the 

kinetic energy per weight unit, which means that it represents the height from which a fluid 

element should fall, in vacuum, to attain velocity v. The velocity head may usually be 

neglected, and thus the total head provides a good approximation to the energy head (Wittke 

1990).  

The hydraulic potential and the kinetic energy vary from one point to another in a fluid. If it is 

assumed that flow takes place in steady-state conditions, they can be described as a function 

of space only. In a system of arbitrary coordinates (x,y,z), the total head of a fluid can thus be 

written as:

dimensional problems, and lines in two-dimensional problems) can be represented by:

2.3.2 Extension of Darcy’s experimental law to three-dimensional flows  

Darcy’s laboratory experiments were carried out with unidirectional flows. However, the 

experimental law may be extended to three-dimensional flows in anisotropic and non-

homogeneous domains. In this case Darcy’s law is written, in vector form, as (Bear 1988):

where vi are the components of Darcy velocity along x, y and z axis, and K is the hydraulic 

conductivity matrix, which is symmetrical and is expressed as a velocity. There is a system of 

orthogonal axis, known as principal axis, for which Kij = 0 for i ? j. 

2.3.3 Laplace equation in homogeneous media 

In an isotropic media the hydraulic conductivity matrix K becomes a single scalar 

(K11 = K22 = K33 = kH) and the extended Darcy´s law (Equation 2.12) is written as:

(2.17) 

When formulating Laplace equation it is assumed that: i) flow takes place in steady-state 

conditions; ii) water is incompressible; iii) the media is incompressible and homogeneous; 

and iv) flow is laminar. The assumption of incompressibility of water is acceptable under 

typical subsurface conditions because, as the compressibility of water is only 4.9 × 10
-10

 /Pa, a 

pressure change of 1 MPa (10 bar) changes the density by only 0.05 % (Zimmerman and 

Bodvarsson 1996). The assumption that flow is laminar is also adequate, as is going to be 

shown in section 2.5.2. 

From the analysis of Equation 2.17 it can be seen that the hydraulic conductivity kH is not in 

the Laplace equation, which means that in an isotropic media the total piezometric head is 

independent of permeability, being dependent only on the domain geometry and boundary 

conditions. 

According to Harr (1962), seepage analysis problems associated with embankment dams or 

concrete dam foundations involve four possible types of boundaries (Table 2.2): i) impervious 

boundary; ii) entrances and exits; iii) seepage face; and iv) free surface. Therefore, boundary 

conditions can be defined by the hydraulic head value, ?, by the discharge, or by a free 

surface condition. When the boundary condition is defined by the hydraulic head, the latter 

can be constant:

h

or it can vary along the boundary: 

)3,2,1()(

?? ixf

?  (2.19) 

The seepage face is a particular case of this type of boundary condition, in which pressure is 

zero, and thus the hydraulic head equals the elevation head.

where ni are the direction cosines of the normal to the surface. An impervious boundary is a 

particular case of this boundary condition, where the discharge is zero. 



 19 

Boundary condition Remarks 

Impervious The interface between the foundation and adjacent materials with very low 

permeability, such as concrete or a very low permeability soil, is simulated as an 

impervious boundary. As no flow takes place across an impervious boundary flow 

in the pervious media next to the impervious boundary is parallel to that boundary. 

Entrances and exits The lines defining the area where water enters or leaves the pervious domain are 

known as entrances and exits. Along these lines the hydraulic head is the same, 

regardless of their direction or shape. Flow is perpendicular to any entrance or exit. 

Seepage face In embankment dams, the saturated pervious soil mass may have a boundary 

exposed to the atmosphere and allows water to escape along this boundary. 

Pressure along this surface is atmospheric. This boundary condition does not occur 

in concrete dams. 

Free surface This boundary, as for an impervious boundary, is not crossed by flow 

 
 

Table 2.2 – Types of boundaries in seepage analysis problems associated with embankment 

dams or concrete dam foundations. 

A free surface condition (or phreatic condition) is established by simultaneously imposing the 

hydraulic head (which is equal to the elevation head) and the value of the discharge (discharge

The location of a free surface is a priori unknown and is part of the required solution. 

The solution of a flow problem in a continuum media involves determining the distribution of 

the hydraulic head in the domain under analysis in such a way that the equation of continuity 

and the boundary conditions are satisfied, which enables the evaluation of other flow factors 

and the mechanical effects of flow (Carmo Vaz 1979). 

2.4 Hydromechanical behaviour of rock joints 

2.4.1 Fluid flow in a single joint 

It is essential to understand how fluid flows in rock joints in order to address the complex 

hydromechanical behaviour of concrete dam foundations, and this has been the subject of 

extensive research. The most commonly applied conceptual model for flow through a single 

fracture, known as the parallel plate model, represents the fracture as the void space between 

two parallel smooth plates (Louis 1969; Louis and Maini 1970; Snow 1965). The solution for 

steady state laminar incompressible flow in such fracture geometry gives the mean velocity 

as: 

ik
f

?v  (2.22) 



   20 

where i = hydraulic gradient applied to the fluid (m/m), and the fracture hydraulic 

conductivity is given by 

?12

2
ga

k
f
?  

(2.23) 

where a = fracture aperture (m); ? = kinematic viscosity of the fluid (m
2
/s); and 

g = acceleration of gravity (m/s
2
).  The flow rate per unit width is thus expressed by the cubic 

law: 

?q v i
ga

a
?12

3

?  
(2.24) 

Thus, the laminar discharge of parallel-plate openings is proportional to the cube of aperture, 

which means that it is extremely sensitive to the size of the aperture. 

Natural rock fractures are neither smooth nor parallel and thus several studies have been 

carried out in order to establish whether the parallel plate model is adequate for the prediction 

of flow in natural fractures. Louis (1969) showed that the cubic law is essentially valid for 

laminar flow in rock joints but proposed an empirical correction factor for this law in order to 

account for fracture roughness. Lomitze, in 1951, and Barton and de Quadros (1997) also 

suggested the use of an extra roughness coefficient, and similar formulas were proposed by 

these researchers, with different correction factors due to the different samples of fractures 

that were used: Lomitze used smooth glass plates with variable roughnessess, achieved by 

glueing sand grains to the surface, while Louis and Barton and de Quadros used different rock 

fractures.  

Most of the studies suggested that better predictions could be obtained if the joint wall 

roughness and the regions where the joint walls touch were taken into account. The joint wall 

roughness leads to spatial variations in aperture and the contact between both fracture walls 

leads to partial obstruction of the flow. Witherspoon et al. (1980) stated that the apparent 

reduction in flow due to deviations from the parallel plate geometry could be incorporated 

into the cubic law by multiplying the flow rate by a linear correction factor. Tsang and 

Witherspoon (1981) developed a physical model where the single fracture is represented by a 

collection of voids and the closure of the fracture results from a deformation of these voids. 

This model enabled fracture roughness to be characterized from a relationship between the 

stress-displacement measurements of intact rock and those of jointed rock, and these 

researchers thus proposed the use of a weighted average aperture in the cubic law that leads to 

flow rate as a function of normal stress. Predicted flow rates using this model were close to 



 21 

results from laboratory data on granite and basalt. Neuzil and Tracy (1981) developed a 

different model for flow in a fracture, where the fracture is represented by a set of parallel 

plate openings with different apertures, and they presented theoretical relationships between 

mean aperture and flow rate. They suggested the use of an aperture frequency distribution for 

the fracture. Barton et al. (1985) suggested that a rock fracture has both a mechanical and a 

hydraulic aperture with an empirical relation that considers the joint roughness coefficient 

(JRC) and stated that the hydraulic aperture should be used in the cubic law.  

The concepts of mechanical and hydraulic aperture are particularly relevant. Olsson and 

Barton (2001) defined the mechanical joint aperture (E) as the average point-to-point distance 

between two rock joint surfaces, perpendicular to a selected plane. A single value can be used 

to define the aperture, but it can also be described stochastically. The aperture distribution is 

only valid at a certain state of stress and pore pressure. The mechanical aperture is usually 

determined from a two dimensional (2D) joint section, which is only a part of the real 3D 

surface. The hydraulic aperture (e) is measured by analysing the fluid flow and can be 

determined both from laboratory fluid flow experiments and borehole pumping tests in the 

field. Barton et al. (1985) proposed a nonlinear empirical correlation between hydraulic and 

mechanical aperture.  

According to Liu (2005) the assumption that the hydraulic and mechanical apertures are equal 

has been shown to be a good approximation for a high flow rate and large apertures, but 

laboratory data and numerical experiments suggest that the approximation breaks down as the 

stress acting perpendicular to the fracture plane results in fracture apertures approaching the 

scale of the surface roughness. The hydraulic aperture is always less than the mechanical 

aperture and their ratio depends crucially on the fracture roughness. 

2.4.2 Hydromechanical behaviour during joint normal closure 

The influence of normal stress on the aperture and flow behaviour of rock joints has been the 

subject of extensive research (e.g. Barton and de Quadros 1997; Barton et al. 1985; 

Cammarata et al. 2007; Cook 1992; Gale et al. 1994; Hans and Boulon 2003; Kulatilake et al. 

2008; Li et al. 2008; Londe and Sabarly 1966; Lopez et al. 2007; Marache et al. 2008; Neuzil 

and Tracy 1981; Noorishad et al. 1992; Pyrak-Nolte and Morris 2000; Rutqvist et al. 1992; 

Sisavath et al. 2003; Tsang and Witherspoon 1981; Witherspoon et al. 1980).  

The typical mechanical and hydromechanical behaviour of rock joints under normal stress is 

shown in Figure 2.3. The normal deformation is non-linear (Figure 2.3 a) and the rate of 

deformation is greater at low normal stress, which means that fracture stiffness increases with 

increasing effective normal stress. The same figure shows there is a scale effect and that the 

maximum joint closure increases with sample size (Yoshinaka et al. 1993).  



   22 

Regarding the hydromechanical behaviour, experimental results show that there is a decrease 

in fracture transmissivity with normal stress, but there is an apparent residual transmissivity 

(Tr) at high stress when the fracture appears to be mechanically compressed (Figure 2.3 b). 

The transmissivity (T) of a fracture with an aperture a and hydraulic conductivity kf is given 

by: 

akT
f

?  (2.25) 

The residual transmissivity indicates that the fluid flow at high stress may be dominated by 

tube-like flow channels, which cannot be closed easily (Rutqvist and Stephansson 2003). This 

effect led Witherspoon et al. (1980) to introduce the concept of “residual hydraulic aperture”. 

The phenomenon of size effect for normal closure, which indicates that fracture hydraulic 

conductivity increases with specimen size, has been suggested by several researchers based 

both on experimental data (Witherspoon et al. 1980; Yoshinaka et al. 1993) and on theoretical 

studies (e.g. Neuzil and Tracy 1981). 

Several constitutive models that simulate joint normal closure have been developed, (Bandis 

et al. 1983; Barton et al. 1985; Goodman 1974) of which the most commonly applied is the 

hyperbolic function developed by Bandis.

2.4.3 Hydromechanical behaviour during shear displacement 

The inherent roughness of rock mass discontinuities gives rise to the phenomenon of 

dilatancy, described by Plesha (1987) as a tendency of two contacting bodies to separate 

during relative tangential motion due to the sliding of rough surfaces of one body on those of 

the other. This separation during shear displacement causes an increase in joint hydraulic 

apertures and consequently an increase in joint permeability. This effect on joint permeability 

has been analysed both theoretically (e.g. Barton et al. 1985; Bawden et al. 1980) and 

experimentally (e.g. Chen et al. 2000; Esaki et al. 1999; Olsson and Barton 2001; Yeo et al. 

1998). 

Figure 2.4 shows the typical mechanical and hydromechanical behaviour of clean, rough, 

dilatant rock joints under constant normal stress. Regarding the mechanical behaviour, there is 

a rapid increase in shear stress up to a peak, followed by a loss in load-carrying capacity. The 

shear displacement is accompanied by shear dilation, as shown in the lower curves of Figure 

2.4 a). During elastic deformation of the fracture, there is minimum dilation. The onset of 

rapid dilation occurs when asperities begin to slide against each other. The rate of dilation 

(slope of ?un curve) increases and reaches a maximum, which is known as the peak shear 

stress (Barton et al 1985). There is also a scale effect: for a larger sample, the peak shear 

stress is smaller and takes place after a larger shear displacement. The onset of shear dilation 

is delayed in larger samples because a larger displacement is required to reach peak shear 

stress. 

Concerning the hydromechanical behaviour, laboratory experiments show that decreases in 

hydraulic  conductivity  during  shear  displacement  are  a  result  of gouge production, which

   24 

tends to block flow paths. The increase in aperture due to dilatancy has the opposite effect. 

The tests carried out on granite by Esaki et al. (1999) and by Olsson and Barton (2001) show 

that the joint transmissivity starts to increase after about 1 mm of shear displacement and then 

increases rapidly by about 1-2 orders of magnitude up to 5 mm. Afterwards, curves tend to be 

flat and any further shear displacement may give rise to relatively small changes in 

permeability (Figure 2.4 b). It is worth noting that little experimental work exists on the effect 

of shear deformation on rock joints’ hydraulic conductivity due to difficulties involved in 

carrying out this kind of test. 

Constitutive models for hydromechanical coupling during shear displacement of rock joints, 

with the hydraulic aperture given as a function of the real mechanical aperture and the joint 

roughness coefficient (JRC), were developed by Barton et al. (1985) and by Olsson and 

Barton (2001).  

2.5 Specific features of concrete dam foundations 

Concrete dam foundation rock masses usually need treatment to satisfy the requirements of 

stability, deformation and low permeability. Ground improvement works depend significantly 

on the type and size of the dam, and are essential to the structure’s safety. Different measures 

are available to: i) increase foundation shear strength, stability of abutments and foundation 

stiffness; ii) improve the contact between the dam concrete and the foundation rock mass, and 

iii) reduce both the quantity of water flowing through the foundation and uplift pressures. A 

detailed description of available methods of foundation treatment is presented in ICOLD 

(1993; 2005). The uppermost strata of the foundation rock mass is often strengthened with 

consolidation grouting which increases the rock mass deformation modulus in the area close 

to the base of the dam and thus contributes to reducing deformation due to subsequent dam 

loading. Another important objective of consolidation grouting is to seal some of the 

discontinuities close to the dam/foundation interface, which, as a result of excavation works, 

is usually a more pervious area than the rock mass at depth. Treatment by both sealing and 

drainage measures is particularly relevant in hydraulic and hydromechanical analysis of 

concrete dam foundations and thus this issue is addressed below. 

Dam construction and the subsequent filling of the reservoir transmit large loads to the 

foundation and cause changes in the aperture of the discontinuities through which water 

flows, both upstream and downstream from the dam, modifying the natural flow pattern. The 

rock mass in the vicinity of the dam becomes subject to a large difference in hydraulic head 

between the upstream and downstream areas (large hydraulic gradient). In addition, the cyclic 

variation in both reservoir level and ambient temperature contribute to continuous change in 

flow paths (variations in ambient temperature cause changes in the structure’s temperature, 

which may give rise to dam displacements that affect the dam foundation deformation, and 



 25 

thus the aperture of the discontinuities through which water flows). The flow regime under 

these conditions has been studied by some researchers, and this issue is also addressed here. 

2.5.1 Grout curtains and drainage systems 

Seepage through the foundation and abutments is a major concern in concrete dams. Seepage 

control, necessary to prevent excessive uplift pressures and erosion of material in open joints, 

is usually made with grout curtains and drainage systems (Figure 2.5). A grout curtain creates 

a solid mass through which it is more difficult for groundwater to flow, so it reduces seepage 

under the dam. The drainage curtain is usually a line of boreholes drilled downstream from 

the grout curtain to collect and control seepage under the dam and so reduce the uplift. 

Reduction of uplift water pressures increases effective stresses and consequently leads to 

increased safety.  

The most widespread method to reduce the hydraulic conductivity of an area of the rock mass 

foundation is cement-based injection grouting. A grout curtain underneath a dam is usually 

constructed by a series of grout holes aligned in a single row, but in some cases it may include 

two or even more adjacent rows. These are usually drilled from the drainage gallery, close to 

the upstream face of the dam. In arch dams, special care must be taken in order not to locate 

these boreholes in the area of tensile stresses that usually develop within the rock mass, below 

the heel of the dam. The first holes grouted, called primary holes, are commonly spaced 10 to 

12 m apart, so the grouting of any of these holes usually does not interfere with the grouting 

of  the  adjacent  ones. The  following series  of  holes  grouted (secondary holes)  are  located

   26 

midway between the primary holes, and the next series (tertiary holes) midway between the 

secondary and primary holes. Additional grout holes may be necessary if the permeability has 

not yet been reduced to the desired level. Before grouting, water pressure tests are carried out 

in each borehole and the decision regarding the necessity of additional grouting is usually 

based on a permeability criterion. In this way, it is possible to form a continuous curtain or 

bulb of grouted rock and thus reduce the rock mass permeability in that area. Special care 

must be taken with grouting pressures, in order not to cause further opening of the 

discontinuities or enlargement of voids within the foundation. In a generally sound 

foundation, a typical grout curtain varies in depth from about 0.35 to 0.75 H, where H is the 

height of the reservoir above the top of the grout curtain. 

The drainage curtain is usually drilled from the drainage gallery. In some cases, however, 

such as in thin arch dams without galleries, it may be drilled either from the downstream face 

of the dam or from the rock mass surface close to the toe of the dam. Drainage boreholes are 

drilled after grouting is complete, to minimize the risk of filling the holes with grout. The 

usual diameter of drainage boreholes is 76 mm, and they are typically located 1.5 to 5 m 

apart. As a general rule, drainage borehole depths vary from 20 to 40 % of the water head, and 

from 35 to 70 % of the grout curtain depth (Wyllie 1999). The drain holes may be uncased, 

when drilled in sound rock, or cased with perforated plastic casing in fractured rock, which 

will keep the hole open and prevent the rock becoming loose from the borehole walls. 

Drainage in a concrete dam foundation is always relevant, and is of particular importance in 

jointed rock masses with discontinuities with a very small aperture where high water 

pressures may develop over time. 

2.5.2 Flow regime in concrete dam foundations 

Some of the studies that have been carried out concerning the flow regime in concrete dam 

foundations are briefly presented below. 

The boundaries between different flow regimes (laminar and turbulent) within rock fissures 

are dependent on the relative roughness and on the Reynolds number (Louis 1969). The 

relative roughness is given by k/Dh, where k is the absolute roughness of the fissure walls 

(asperity height) and Dh is the hydraulic diameter of the fissure, equal to four times the 

hydraulic radius (defined as the area over the perimeter of the conduit), or equal to two times 

the fissure aperture, if it is assumed that the width of the cross section of the fissure through 

which the flow occurs is much greater that its aperture. The relative roughness varies between 

0 for a smooth fissure and 0.5 when the asperity (roughness) height is equal to the fissure 

aperture. The Reynolds number is given by: 



 27 

?

v
R

e
h

D
?  

(2.26) 

where Dh = hydraulic diameter of the fissure; v  = mean flow velocity in the fissure and 

? = kinematic viscosity of the water.    

Studies carried out by Louis (1969) led to the conclusion that flow in a joint is parallel for 

relative roughnesses lower than 0.033. In this case, based on test results and on information 

available from the literature, Louis assumed that the transition from laminar to turbulent flow 

occurred at the Reynolds number of 2300 (critical Reynolds number). For non-parallel flows, 

i.e. for relative roughnesses higher than 0.033, the critical Reynolds number depended on the 

fissure roughness, decreasing with the increase in roughness. The flow laws describe the 

relation between the Reynolds number and the dimensionless resistance coefficient ? (Louis 

1969). Louis compiled the different flow laws and indicated their range of validity, as shown 

in Figure 2.6. In this figure, the various regions in which different types of flow occur are 

numbered from I to V. Two different flow laws are shown in Figure 2.6: the first, in region I, 

is the law of resistance for the isothermic laminar flow of a viscous, incompressible fluid 

through narrow joints; and the second, in region IV, is the law of resistance proposed by 

Louis for laminar flow within a rough fissure.  

 

 

Figure 2.6 – Laws for 1-dimensional flow in a fissure, presented by Louis (1969) (after 

Goodman et al. 1983). 



   28 

Louis stated that the relative roughness of natural rock joints is generally greater than 0.033 

and highlighted that in nature rock joints are quite often filled with soil materials, such as clay 

or sand, caused by weathering, tectonic action and sedimentation, and that, in such cases, the 

flow in the joints can be considered laminar and described with Darcy’s law. 

Franciss (1970) studied the hydraulic behaviour of undeformable fissured systems in a linear 

steady state in order to understand better water movement through jointed rock masses. His 

research included a theoretical study about the hydraulic conductivity of jointed media, in 

which he took into account the results that had been presented by Louis (1969), and which led 

him to the conclusion that flow is predominantly laminar in a rock mass in which the average 

aperture of the discontinuities is lower than 1 mm and the hydraulic gradient lower than 10 

(Figure 2.7). In addition, he statistically analysed the results of 377 Lugeon type tests carried 

out at various depths in the foundations (mainly granitic) of three different dams in Brazil, 

and the results of the study indicated that flow was laminar in between 62.9 and 80.4 % of the 

tests. He therefore concluded that for the hydraulic gradients observed in dam foundations, 

largely due to the discontinuous nature of seepage paths, seepage velocities are generally low 

enough for laminar flow to be established, even in fissures with significant hydraulic 

apertures.

Wittke (1990) analysed the influence of turbulence on the numerical results in detail. For this, 

he compared the results of two flow tests carried out with plexiglass models, which simulated 

jointed rock masses, with the results of discrete models. Devices for measuring the 

piezometric head were installed at various points within each of the experimental 

arrangements, to determine the potential distribution. The first model simulated a slope in a 

rock mass crossed by two sets of discontinuities, in which the height of the water table in one 

of the discontinuities, located far away from the slope’s surface, remained constant. Such a 

boundary condition could represent, for example, a fault with a large aperture, into which 

water from remote areas could flow freely. In this model, the discharge from individual 

discontinuities at the slope face could be measured. The second model simulated the flow into 

a tunnel in a slope of jointed rock. In both models, the apertures and the discontinuity 

spacings were relatively large, when compared with the models’ other dimensions. 

The experimental potential distributions were compared with those obtained with numerical 

models, in which laminar flow was initially assumed. Taking into account the gradients 

calculated for individual sections of discontinuity, the flow in various sections was found to 

be turbulent. Thus, the equations valid for turbulent flow were afterwards considered, and 

additional numerical results were obtained. Figure 2.8 and Figure 2.9 show the comparison 

between test and numerical results for both the studied cases.

computations: a) distribution of piezometric head; b) flow conditions; and c) seepage water 

discharges (after Wittke 1990).

Figure 2.9 – Flow into a tunnel. Comparison of the results from a model test and from 

computations: a) details of problem; b) distribution of piezometric head; and c) states of flow 

(after Wittke 1990). 

Both figures show that the numerical piezometric heads are very close to those measured and 

that the consideration of turbulence does not significantly alter the potential distribution. 

Wittke stated that the deviations between the calculated and measured potentials could be 

explained by the large aperture of the discontinuities in relation to the length of individual 

sections of discontinuity. Consequently, the velocity of flow became so large that the energy 

losses arising at the points of intersection between the two sets of discontinuities could no 

longer be neglected. Wittke highlighted that the velocities of flow are considerably lower in 

practical problems, and both the energy losses at intersections and the proportion of 

discontinuity sections containing turbulent flow are therefore less. In the case of flow through 

a slope, the difference between the measured discharges and those calculated on the 

assumption of part turbulent and part laminar flow was 8.6 %.   

From these comparative investigations, Wittke concluded that the neglecting of turbulence 

generally has little influence on the potential distribution, and thus neither on the forces 

resulting from flow through the rock mass.  

From the study carried out general conclusions which also apply to concrete dam foundations 

can be drawn. Wittke stated that the consideration of turbulence may only become significant 

if seepage water discharges need to be determined accurately, and highlighted that turbulent 

flow scarcely arises in problems involving natural rock masses. He added that the statements 



 31 

concerning the aperture of individual discontinuities are always associated with scatter, 

which, in practical cases, has a far greater effect on the calculated seepage water discharges 

than differences due to the state of flow. He also concluded that the seepage flow in a rock 

mass is steady and approximately laminar in most rock engineering problems, and 

consequently, problems in which the discontinuities are spaced closely with respect to the 

structure’s dimensions may be solved using the generalized Darcy’s law. 

Zimmerman and Bodvarsson (1996) show that the laminar solution given by the cubic law is 

stable when:

(2.27) 

where p?  = average magnitude of the pressure gradient; ? = dynamic viscosity of the fluid; 

? = fluid density; and h = joint aperture. This expression is obtained from both the average 

velocity of fluid flow through the fracture and the Reynolds number at which flow changes 

from laminar to turbulent (critical Reynolds number), and shows that high viscosity, low fluid 

density and small apertures all tend to stabilize the flow field. The above mentioned 

researchers state that this stability condition is satisfied in most subsurface flow situations and 

give the example of water with a dynamic viscosity of 10

of 10

, which are the approximate values at 20°C. In this case, even for apertures as 

large as 10

 m, laminar flow will be stable for pressure gradients as high as about 

1.4 × 10
7
 Pa/m. This gradient is equivalent to about 14 MPa/m (140 bars/m), which is much 

larger than the gradients typically encountered in dam foundations. They add, however, that 

for a real rough-walled fracture, inertia effects due to tortuous flow paths will lead to 

deviations from the cubic law long before genuine turbulence occurs, i.e., at lower flow rates. 

They conclude that, in this case, flow is laminar for pressure gradients lower than 10
4
 Pa/m, 

which is about 0.1 bar/m. This critical gradient is larger than most naturally-occurring 

groundwater potential gradients. 

If there were a continuous rock joint with an aperture of 1 mm close to a dam/foundation 

interface, developing within the rock mass from the heel to the toe of the dam, the gradient 

could be higher than 0.1 bar/m. In reality, water usually flows through a network of 

interconnected discontinuities, whose apertures are smaller than 1 mm, and therefore laminar 

flow may be assumed. Indeed, according to Barton et al. (1985) numerous tests performed at 

US dam sites in the depth range 0-60 m indicated that most conducting apertures were in the 

range of 50-150 ?m at this shallow depth.

2.5.3 Main problems usually found in the behaviour of concrete dam 
foundations 

The role of the foundation in the safety of concrete dams is highlighted in the first chapter. It 

is mentioned that the majority of recorded failures were due to problems in the foundation 

rock mass such as those due to weathering processes that lead to a loss of strength, with 

subsurface erosion and dissolution being the most significant, and lack of shear resistance in 

rock masses’ weak planes of unfavourable direction.  

There are a large number of reported cases of dam failure due to the rock mass foundation 

behaviour or to deficient foundation treatment, of which the most well-known case is the 

failure of the 61 m high Malpasset dam, in France in 1959, which was the first failure of an 

arch dam. The failure occurred shortly before the first filling of the reservoir was completed. 

After many years of research it was concluded that the accident could be satisfactorily 

explained by the development of full uplift pressures deep in the foundation rock (Londe 

1985). These high pressures could have built up due to two simultaneous factors: i) on the left 

bank the thrust was applied in the direction of the rock schistosity and a crack opening along 

the schistosity allowed hydrostatic pressure to be installed to a great depth; and ii) rock mass 

permeability was highly sensitive to stress, and was reduced by a factor of approximately 0.01 

due to dam load (Figure 2.10 a).  This phenomenon, which was previously unknown, created 

a hydraulic barrier under the dam which was subjected to high water pressures, and 

contributed to failure by causing a wedge of rock in the foundation of the left abutment to 

slide along a fault located under the structure. Investigation carried out after the failure of 

Malpasset dam led to a consensus among dam engineers that most arch dam foundations 

should be drained to a deep level and the drainage efficiency checked by an adequate network 

of piezometers.  

Wittke (1990) presented a modified hypothesis for the failure of the Malpasset dam, based on 

the results of numerical analysis carried out with a three-dimensional finite element (FE) 

model. The basic failure mechanism was the same as that suggested by Londe, but Wittke 

assumed an isotropic rock mass permeability, not taking into account the results of laboratory 

permeability tests carried out after the failure which indicated that the permeability was stress-

dependent. Numerical analysis carried out taking into account seepage and uplift showed that 

due to construction and reservoir filling tensile stresses arose in the left abutment and valley 

floor in a direction perpendicular to that of the schistosity. The isotropic elastic analysis also 

indicated shear stresses on the discontinuities downstream from the dam which acted 

upwards, showing a tendency of the rock mass immediately below the dam to slide 

downstream.  He suggested that the tensile stresses on the schistosity led to the formation of a 

crack in the left abutment immediately upstream from the dam in which the hydrostatic 

pressure built up. The great variation in hydraulic head within the rock mass between the 



 33 

crack and the area downstream from the dam gave rise to high seepage pressures which 

increased the tendency of the rock mass to slide towards downstream (Figure 2.10 b). This 

hypothesis was based on the observation of a crack within the rock mass immediately 

upstream from the heel of the dam, as shown in Alonso (2005). 

In Portugal, although a high percentage of concrete dams have been affected by different 

types of deterioration, both in the dam body and in the foundation, there has never been an 

accident with this type of dams. The following paragraphs include a brief summary of the 

main cases of foundation deterioration observed in our country (LNEC 1999a; Mascarenhas 

1991; Pedro 1999a; Pedro 2001; Pedro et al. 1989; Ramos 2008). Reported cases concern the 

foundation of arch dams of different ages, with different geometrical and geotechnical 

characteristics (Figure 2.11): the cases of Varosa and Vilarinho das Furnas dams, due to grout 

curtains’ lack of resistance to tensile stresses; the cases of Funcho and Odeáxere dams, due to 

problems related with foundation treatment; the case of Bouçã dam, due to erosion; and the 

case of Venda Nova dam, due to both erosion and dissolution.  

Varosa dam is located on the river Varosa, in the North of Portugal. It is a double curvature 

arch dam with a maximum height of 76 m, 213 m of development at the crest, and the 

thickness varies in the central cantilever from 12 m at the base to 3.5 m at the crest. The 

foundation consists of fresh to moderately weathered granite, crossed by joints with a 

relatively low resistance. The dam construction ended in the middle of 1976 and the first 

filling of the reservoir took about a year, from the end of 1976 until the end of 1977. In this 

dam, shortly after  the  first filling  of  the reservoir  had been completed, high uplift pressures

were observed in the left bank and particularly in the valley bottom, where the percentages of 

hydraulic head were 100 % close to the heel of the dam and extended towards downstream 

with values higher than 80 % (percentage of hydraulic head is the ratio of the water head 

measured at a given level, expressed in metres of height of water, to the height of water in the 

reservoir above that level). New drains were drilled in the central area, which allowed a 

decrease in uplift pressures, but around 5 years later, in 1983, an increase in the reservoir level 

until it was full led to a significant increase in discharges in the bottom of the valley, which 

tended to increase still further with the water at a stabilized level. In this case it was 

concluded that the successive loading/unloading cycles due to an operating regime with large 

daily variations of the water level in the reservoir damaged the grout curtain. Comprehensive 

analysis showed that the development of high tensile stresses upstream from the dam had led 

to the opening of the superficial joints and had damaged the grout curtain, in an area less than 

1 m deep. Repair work was carried out with both cement grout and acrylic resin. 

Vilarinho das Furnas dam, concluded in the end of 1971, is located on the River Homem, in 

the North of Portugal. It is a double curvature arch with a maximum height of 94 m and a total 

length between the abutments at the crest elevation of 384.5 m. The foundation consists of 

granite, crossed by veins of quartz and dolerite. In 1977 excessively high water pressures 

were recorded in the valley bottom and at the base of the right slope, and this was observed 

again on several occasions. Some measures have been taken over time, namely the drilling of 

additional drainage boreholes, in 1977 and 1983, grouting works, in 1980, and cleaning of 

both drainage and piezometric systems, in 1983. Additional monitoring equipment 

(piezometers and foundation extensometers) was installed in 1987 so as to better evaluate the 

hydromechanical behaviour of the dam foundation. Comprehensive analysis of dam behaviour 

showed that the grout curtain opens when two phenomena occur simultaneously: i) reservoir 

close to the retention water level and ii) low concrete temperature. The decision was made not 

to carry out any foundation treatment but to avoid high reservoir levels during the months in 

which the concrete temperature is low. After this change in the operating regime no more 

openings of the grout curtain were observed.  

Odeáxere dam, located in the South of Portugal, is a double curvature arch concluded in 1958 

with a maximum height of 41 m and a total crest length of 150 m. The foundation consists of 

schist and greywacke and is very deformable, especially in the right bank. In 1967, one of the 

blocks in the right abutment showed a non-reversible displacement while in the left bank 

significant seepage was detected under the wing wall of the abutment. Lugeon type tests 

pointed out the presence of a badly consolidated zone showing high permeability. Grouting 

was carried out in order to achieve the required consolidation and watertightness. 

Funcho dam, located on the River Arade in the South of Portugal, is a 49 m high double 

curvature arch with 165 m  of  development at the crest and  a  width that varies, in the central

cantilever, from 6.5 m at the base to 2.25 m at the crest. The foundation rock mass, highly 

heterogeneous  and  anisotropic, consists  of  schist and greywacke (DGRAH 1978). The dam 

construction ended in 1991 and the first filling of the reservoir, which started at the beginning 

of November 1992, was only concluded in January 2001. The long period taken for the first 

filling of the reservoir was due to  the  need  for  successive foundation treatments, which 

made  it  necessary to hold the filling (LNEC 2005a). Although relatively high permeability 

values were obtained in Lugeon type tests carried out in the schistose area, it was extremely 

difficult to seal the discontinuities with cement grout, due to their small aperture and to 

further weathering of the rock mass when subjected to the induced pressures. In some areas, 

sealing of the discontinuities could only be achieved with an acrylic resin, whose use is 

currently forbidden due to its toxicity. This case is mentioned again in chapter 4, as an 

example of a dam where the use of in situ tests similar to those in this study was of major 

importance in deciding the treatment to be carried out. 

Bouça dam, located on the river Zêzere in the central region of Portugal, is a double curvature 

arch concluded in 1955, 70 m high, with a crest length of 171 m and of which the thickness 

varies from 7.5 m at the base to 0.9 m at the crest. The foundation consists mainly of granite 

and of hornfels. In Bouçã dam foundation, deterioration was due to progressive clogging of 

the drainage system during a period of over 30 years. Hydrochemical analysis of the drained 

water showed mechanical wear of the joint surfaces and of the material inside some faults. 

Venda Nova arch-gravity dam, concluded in 1951, is located on the river Rabagão, in the 

north of Portugal, and has a maximum height of 97 m, and a total length of 345 m between 

the abutments at the crest elevation. The foundation consists of granite, except in the upper 

part of the right bank in which there are hornfels. It is crossed by many joints and faults, filled 

with clay and mylonite. The dam has a peripheral joint in the upstream area of the 

dam/foundation interface, introduced with the aim of reducing tensile stresses in the rock 

mass upper area. The rock mass was subjected to cyclic loads and the peripheral joint did not 

behave properly, and, as in the above-mentioned case of Varosa dam, the grout curtain was 

damaged due to high tensile stresses in the rock mass. In this case, however, grout curtain 

deterioration progressed over the years, giving rise to the opening of horizontal joints and 

leading to a progressive increase in discharges, which went up to around 850 l/min. At the 

same time, due to the high quantity of water flowing through the foundation, there was a 

significant increase in erosion and physical-chemical deterioration, which contributed to the 

increase in permeability in the upstream foundation area. Treatment was carried out with 

cement grout and acrylic resin.

2.6 Numerical modelling 

2.6.1 Continuum equivalent and discontinuum models 

There are two different modelling approaches to simulate hydromechanical coupling 

behaviour of fractured rock masses. The first is based on an equivalent continuum and the 

second on discrete fracture networks. The choice of continuum or discontinuum approach 

depends on many case-specific factors, mainly on the size and spacing of the discontinuities 

when compared to the size of the problem, and on the jointing pattern. The two different types 

of models may be combined and in this case it is called a hybrid model. This allows some of 

the disadvantages of each type of model to be avoided. Different numerical models are 

usually used for each modelling approach. 

In equivalent continuum models, materials’ properties have to be adjusted in such a way that 

the major characteristics of the rock mass’s physical behaviour are properly represented. 

Regarding fluid flow, the equivalent permeability of the different rock mass areas may be 

estimated from the results of Lugeon type tests. The seepage forces induce deformations in 

the continuous medium, which alters the permeability. This type of analysis requires 

correlations between stress or strain and permeability to be previously established.  

In fracture flow models the discontinuities are explicitly represented, with their individual 

hydromechanical properties. The flow of water is usually assumed to occur only through the 

joints. The joint water pressure gives rise to changes in joint apertures and, consequently, 

changes in flow rates. Discontinuum modelling of the hydromechanical behaviour of jointed 

rock masses requires field, hydraulic and mechanical characterization data, such as orientation 

and spacing of discontinuities, joint normal stiffness, joint apertures and residual aperture, 

which is not readily available. 

2.6.2 Models to study the hydraulic and hydromechanical behaviour of dam 
foundations 

2.6.2.1 Analytical solutions and experimental techniques 

The first theoretical study about seepage in rock masses with drainage systems was presented 

by O. Hoffman in 1928. The study was based upon the results presented by Forchheimer 

about eleven years before, in which the theory of seepage through porous media and a 

graphical method for the solution of Laplace equation were presented (differential equation 

which describes the behaviour of fluids in a homogeneous media). In the 1930s and 1940s 

several studies were published with exact solutions to determine the piezometric surfaces in 

homogeneous and isotropic foundations, with different cases of grouting and drainage 

(Terzaghi, Weaver, (Muskat 1946), Dachler, among others). 



   38 

These models were being developed while an intensive discussion regarding uplift pressures 

was taking place. The development of the different hypotheses assumed to determine the 

distribution of water pressures in dam foundations can be found in Serafim (1954), Smith 

(1971),  Andrade (1982), and Schnitter (1994). Until the middle of the 19th century the effect 

of the uplift pressure was not taken into account neither in the dam body nor in its foundation. 

The effects of uplift pressures started to receive attention in around 1875 from Belgian 

engineers, and became a subject of debate after the failure of Bouzey gravity dam in France in 

1895, due to seepage through the masonry. Particularly relevant is the study presented in the 

same year by Lévy (1895) in which he suggested a new design criterion in order to avoid the 

inflow of water into the dam masonry joints: he stated that the compression at the joint end in 

the upstream face should be higher than the reservoir water pressure at that point. In addition, 

he proposed that a vertical drainage system should be installed close to the upstream face of a 

dam, as a means of minimising problems due to uplift pressures. Lévy´s suggestions started 

an open debate regarding the best way to avoid problems due to seepage. Concerning the dam 

foundation two different ideas arose: some dam engineers were of the opinion that the effects 

of uplift pressures could be avoided by intensive grouting, while others argued that it would 

be preferable to install a line of drains to intercept seepage and thus reduce uplift pressures 

downstream from the drainage line. This discussion later led to a consensus that the best 

option would be to combine both solutions, and this is the current practice. 

In the 1960s, Arthur Casagrande in the first Rankine Lecture about the control of seepage 

through foundations and abutments of dams presented an analytical solution, based on Muskat 

equation, to determine the value of the uplift pressures beneath a dam with a drainage line, 

assuming the opening of a vertical fissure at the heel of the dam. The results of the solution 

presented were validated against their comparison with uplift pressures measured in dams 

with drainage systems (Casagrande 1961).  

Serafim and Del Campo (1965) presented a paper with the analytical solution for the 

distribution of uplift pressures at the base of a dam without drainage systems, in which the 

importance of the opening and closing of different discontinuities due to the filling of the 

reservoir was highlighted.  

Andrade (1982) presented a solution to determine the hydraulic head in dams with one or 

more drainage lines, assuming vertical fissures at the heel and at the toe of the dam, and 

assuming that the dam is impervious and lies on a finite, homogeneous, isotropic and pervious 

layer. The same author later developed a simplified method where the discontinuities through 

which water flowed were represented by bars (Andrade 1983; 1984; 1988). It was called 

“MEPON - Nodal Point Method” and it allowed two and three-dimensional flows to be 

simulated. The medium was assumed to be deformable and the flow to be dependent on the 

state of stress within the foundation. It was a mesh method that required the equilibrium 



 39 

equations to be solved at the nodes, using an iterative procedure. The method was applied to 

determine the flow rates and the uplift pressures at the base of several concrete dams.  

Goodman et al. (1983) proposed a specific analytical solution for flow through a horizontal 

crack of finite length drained by a series of vertical drains. The solution was used to draw 

dimensionless diagrams of uplift pressure on the base of a dam and to demonstrate the 

influence of drains on the distribution and magnitude of uplift forces. This solution was 

obtained when studying a hypothetical situation of a crack developing under the heel of a dam 

due to high overturning moment. Such a crack would have a direct hydraulic connection to 

reservoir and water pressure distribution within the crack and would influence the overall dam 

stability. 

The integration of Laplace equation can be done by analytical or approximated methods, 

using graphical, experimental or numerical techniques. The use of analytical solutions is 

restricted as the majority of the solutions available correspond to two dimensional flows in 

homogeneous and continuum media, with simple boundary conditions. Graphical techniques 

to draw flow nets were widely used (Forchheimer, Leliavsky, among others), but took a lot of 

time and were difficult to apply in domains with complex geometric conditions and various 

boundary conditions. Experimental methods, mainly electric analogs, which associate 

important features of visual methods with the fact that the flow of electricity through 

conducting materials is governed by the same differential equations as flow through porous 

media, were also widely used (Pavlosvsky, Pacher e Yokota, Franciss  (1970), Bear, Louis, 

among others).  

2.6.2.2 Hydraulic models 

The finite differences method was one of the first numerical methods to provide approximate 

solutions, and based on this method Serafim (1954) carried out a study with the main 

objective of contributing to a better understanding of the uplift pressures in dams, a subject 

under much debate at the time. He drew attention to the fact that these forces are different 

from the others acting on dams not only because they depend on the internal structure of the 

concrete and foundations but also because they are influenced by the homogeneity and 

continuity of their materials. Serafim studied the effect of the water pressure exerted on the 

internal surfaces of the concrete, and computed stresses due to these pressures in gravity 

dams, in a horizontal section of the head of a buttress dam and in the arches and cantilevers of 

an arch dam. He used the iteration method to solve the Laplace equation and presented the 

study of the two-dimensional flow in radial sections of arch dams and their foundations. 

Regarding the foundation, he evaluated the influence of the foundation permeability and of 

both the grout and drainage systems on the uplift forces. Results of further studies carried out 

by the same researcher are presented in Serafim (1968).  



   40 

With the occurrence of accidents in large dams, due to seepage in the dam body or in the 

foundation (Teton, Balldwin Hills, Fontenelle, Voughn Creek and Moyie River in the USA, 

Malpasset, in France, and Idbar, in the former Yugoslavia), great progress was made from the 

1960s onwards in the analysis of foundation problems, together with the development of rock 

mechanics. With the development of computers, numerical modelling techniques started to be 

widely used, mainly the FEM, using, when needed, joint elements to simulate discontinuities. 

Since then, several two and three dimensional studies on seepage in dam foundations have 

been presented, which assume anisotropic, discontinuous, and/or fractured media, taking into 

account the influence of the in situ stress conditions and the existence of several seepage 

control measures. The study of the mechanical and hydraulic behaviour of discontinuities, 

with data collected in situ and in laboratory, also played an important role in the development 

and improvement of some models. Some of these models are briefly presented below. 

Mascarenhas (1979) used a series of computer programs developed at the National Laboratory 

for Civil Engineering (LNEC) to analyse seepage in the foundation of concrete dams. The 

programs used linear and isoparametric triangular and quadrilateral finite elements and 

allowed the simulation of two-dimensional flows in both continuum and discontinuum media 

and of axisymmetric flows in continuum media. The programs developed were structured in 

such a way that they enabled the implementation of three successive calculating phases: i) the 

drawing of the FE mesh and validation of data relative to both geometric and hydraulic 

characteristics; ii) calculation of the seepage factors, namely the hydraulic head, pressure and 

velocity, and of the mechanical loads due to seepage; and iii) results interpretation. The codes 

were validated by comparing the numerical results with those obtained in various problems in 

which the solution was known, or with those that had been previously obtained by other 

researchers. Parametric studies were carried out to study the influence of grout and drainage 

systems in the foundation of both gravity and arch dams on the numerical results. The results 

of the continuum models were compared with those obtained assuming discontinuum media. 

Seepage through the foundation of two operating concrete dams was also analysed. 

Carmo Vaz (1979) developed at LNEC a three-dimensional FE program for analysis of 

seepage through rock masses in steady-state conditions based on the assumption of continuum 

medium. Two types of isoparametric FE with linear interpolation functions were used: 

8-noded FE of the cubic type, and 6-noded prismatic FE with triangular bases. The computer 

code, called PERC, included various sub-programs which were structured in a similar way to 

those mentioned above. The code was validated by comparing the numerical results obtained 

in two different problems with analytical solutions: the first was the study of a pumping test in 

a homogeneous medium confined between two impervious boundaries, and the second the 

study of the hydrodynamic pressures in a reservoir with moving walls. The code was 

afterwards used in the analysis of the observed behaviour of a multiple arch dam foundation 

(Mascarenhas et al. 1985; Sousa and Mascarenhas 1984). 



 41 

Wittke (1990) presented detailed studies carried out with large three-dimensional FE models 

of the dam-foundation system of both gravity and arch dams. He analysed in detail the 

interaction between the dam and the rock mass taking into account the seepage flow within 

the foundation, and presented studies regarding proper boundary conditions and suitable 

model and mesh sizes both in large models and in detailed analysis. These models have been 

used to carry out seepage flow and stability analysis of several operating dams (Wittke and 

Polczyk 2002; Wittke et al. 2003). 

Da Silva and Da Gama (2003) developed a FE three-dimensional model for seepage analysis 

in concrete dam foundations, based on the Darcy’s law to represent flow in the continuous 

permeable rock mass and on the Darcy-Weissbach law for pipes to simulate the flow in 

smooth or rough drains, both under laminar or turbulent regime. Two different types of finite 

elements were used to simulate flow in the pervious rock mass, internally divided into 

tetrahedra. The drain was simulated by one-dimensional finite elements. Non-linear flow in 

the drains was modelled by means of a “virtual drain” where the Darcy’s law for smooth 

pipes was applied. The model was validated by comparison of numerical results with the 

results of an analytical solution proposed by Muskat and with the monitoring data of an 

operating dam. The model has been used in studies of optimization of the design of drainage 

systems and in studies of the influence of foundation anisotropy on uplift pressures (Da Silva 

2005; Da Silva 2006).  

2.6.2.3 Hydromechanical models 

The first FE numerical models for hydromechanical analysis were presented in the early 70s. 

These models analysed either linear hydroelastic phenomena in porous media with fully 

implicit coupling or discrete-fractured media using sequential explicit coupling between the 

hydraulic and mechanical analysis (Rutqvist and Stephansson 2003). 

The first method of fully coupled stress-fluid flow analysis in fractured media was presented 

by Noorishad et al. (1982). These authors formulated constitutive relationships for the non-

linear deformable fractures, based on an extension of Biot´s theory of consolidation (Biot’s 

studies provided the constitutive stress-strain relationships on which the analysis of stress and 

fluid flow in deformable porous elastic media is based) and used the flow line element for 

modelling fractures, which saved computer storage and reduced run times when compared to 

modelling with the four-nodal-point element commonly used in FE analysis. The method was 

capable of solving the two-dimensional quasi-static initial-boundary value problem of coupled 

stress and fluid flow in saturated deformable fractured porous media. The code was validated 

by comparison of numerical results with those obtained with the analytical solution of the 

problem of a single vertical fracture intersecting a well of zero radius. To show the full 

capability of the method the effect of fracture and matrix deformability in the same problem 



   42 

was examined in detail, and a second problem of an axisymmetric reservoir with a horizontal 

fracture at the centre was also investigated. 

Asgian (1989) developed a hybrid boundary element-finite difference program for the 

modelling of fluid flow in deformable, jointed rock. The model was used to simulate reservoir 

behaviour with variable joint orientations, injection rates, joint dilation angles and variable 

far-field stress. 

Mendonça (1989) developed a three-dimensional FE model for analysis of the 

hydromechanical behaviour of concrete dam foundations. The foundation rock mass was 

assumed to be an anisotropic continuum media, with stress-dependent permeability. An 

iterative technique was used to account for the stress-flow coupling. The code was developed 

at LNEC and used the same type of elements as the code PERC, which had been developed 

10 years before. The model was used to study the behaviour of Bouçã foundation (Figure 

2.11), and the results obtained with coupled and uncoupled models were compared. 

Numerical results were also compared with in situ recorded data, obtained before and after 

foundation treatment.  

Lamas (1993) developed a FE multilaminate model for hydromechanical analysis of pressure 

tunnels and shafts in fractured rock masses. In addition to the joints belonging to the joint 

sets, the code allows joint elements to be inserted within a model, so as to simulate main 

discontinuities, such as faults, or interfaces between different types of material, such as rock 

and concrete. The program allows both the hydraulic and mechanical models to run 

independently or in a coupled way. Regarding the hydraulic behaviour, it is possible to model 

non-confined laminar flow, and fluid flow can take place simultaneously in the equivalent 

continuum and the discontinuum, and also from each of these media into the other. Regarding 

the mechanical behaviour, various failure criteria are included. The non-linear 

hydromechanical analysis is conducted in terms of effective stresses, using an iterative 

procedure. The model was used to analyse several general problems and was afterwards 

applied to an operating pressure circuit. 

Wei and Hudson (1998) developed a hybrid discrete-continuum model for water flow in the 

near and far fields of deformable jointed rock masses. In the near field the discontinuum 

approach was used, with the discrete element method, and water flowed through 

interconnected fractures only, while in the far field the equivalent continuum model was 

employed, with the boundary integral equation method. Along the interface of the two 

domains, both mechanical and hydraulic compatibility conditions were satisfied. Fully 

coupled hydromechanical analysis could be conducted in the combined near and far fields. 

The effectiveness of the approach was shown by its application to a conceptual dam 

foundation problem.  



 43 

Leitão and Lamas (2006) developed a model of an underground hydroelectric scheme, which 

included the pressure tunnel, the access tunnels and the underground powerhouse, in order to 

study the mechanical and hydraulic interaction during the first filling of the pressure tunnel. 

Analysis was carried out with the code FLAC
3D

, a three-dimensional explicit finite-difference 

program that uses 8-noded brick elements. The coupled hydromechanical model uses an 

iterative procedure between two independent hydraulic and mechanical sub-models. 

In more recent years, in addition to the use of the FEM, several studies have been carried out 

using models of flow in discontinuous media (fracture flow models). These models have been 

applied mainly for gravity dams, namely using discrete element models, with a view to 

evaluating dam stability, taking into account the water pressures resulting from the flow 

conditions (e.g. Barla et al. 2004; Gimenes 2000; Gimenes and Fernández 2006; Lemos 1987; 

Lemos 1999a; Mostyn et al. 1997). A brief summary of the quoted studies is presented in 

chapter 7, in which dam stability assessment is addressed.  

In the case of arch dams 3D models and multiple joint sets are required and it becomes 

difficult to use fracture flow models. Therefore, the assumption of an equivalent continuum 

remains the most widely used tool to study the hydraulic behaviour of dam foundations, 

despite all the investigation carried out regarding flow through discontinuities. Although a 

wide variety of models suitable for the analysis of rock masses are available, the complexity 

of jointing patterns and the lack of data on hydraulic properties of the discontinuity sets 

makes them difficult to apply in most practical cases. Thus, the use of this type of models in 

the interpretation and operational monitoring of the hydraulic behaviour of dam foundations is 

not common. 

To analyse the hydraulic behaviour of dam foundations it is not only necessary to choose the 

most suitable model to use but also to take into account that the grout curtain and the drainage 

system have to be properly simulated, so that the chosen model, which must be realistic and 

computationally efficient, simulates flow accurately. 

2.6.3 Numerical codes used in this study 

Analysis presented in this study were carried out with the codes FLAC, UDEC and 3DEC 

(Itasca 2003; 2004; 2005). These codes were originally developed for application to 

geotechnical problems, and use explicit step-by-step solution algorithms that obtain static 

solutions by dynamic relaxation. The three codes allow large displacement analysis and 

include groundwater models, coupled fluid and thermal modes, and dynamic analysis 

capability. They offer various constitutive models, which can be altered by the user, using the 

built-in FISH programming language. 



   44 

FLAC (Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua) is a two-dimensional finite difference 

program, particularly useful for media that can be modelled as an equivalent continuum with 

only a few discontinuities. FLAC is primarily used for static analysis of soils and rock 

masses. The code uses quadrilateral elements or zones, which are made of two pairs of 

superimposed constant strain triangles, and simulates the performance of materials that 

behave according to linear or non-linear stress/strain laws in response to the applied forces or 

boundary conditions. The material can yield and flow, and the grid formed by the different 

zones can deform and move with the material that is represented. The code includes both 

interface elements to simulate planes along which slip and/or separation can occur, and 

structural elements to simulate structural support, which enables its application to a large 

number of geotechnical problems. Some of the other features are: i) plane-strain, plane-stress 

and axisymmetric geometry modes; ii) two-phase flow analysis to simulate the flow of two 

immiscible fluids through a porous medium and iii) determination of the safety factor using 

the strength reduction method. 

In the present study, only the basic groundwater flow model was employed, to analyse steady 

state seepage flows assuming that the fluid obeys the isotropic form of Darcy´s law. FLAC 

treats steady-flow as an asymptotic case of non-steady-flow. Flow models were run 

independently from mechanical calculations, and only confined flows were simulated. The 

option to model axisymmetric geometry, in which cylindrical coordinates are used, was 

adopted to simulate seepage flow towards a single drain in an equivalent continuum. Two-

dimensional analysis of seepage through concrete dam foundations in a horizontal plane and 

in vertical cross sections of the foundations of both the arch and gravity dams in which in situ 

tests were carried out is presented.  

UDEC (Universal Distinct Element Code) is a two-dimensional numerical code that simulates 

discontinuous media, such as jointed rock masses, subjected to either static or dynamic 

loading. It is ideally suited to study potential modes of failure directly related to the presence 

of discontinuous features. The medium is represented as an assemblage of discrete blocks and 

the discontinuities as boundary conditions between blocks. UDEC enables the modelling of 

jointed rock masses in which large displacement and opening of the discontinuities occurs. 

Individual blocks behave as either rigid or deformable material, and in this second case, 

blocks are subdivided into a mesh of finite-difference elements. These respond according to a 

prescribed linear or non-linear stress-strain law. The relative motion of the discontinuities is 

also governed by linear or non-linear force-displacement relations for movement in both the 

normal and shear directions. This code also allows the simulation of rock reinforcement and 

surface support. 

UDEC is able to perform a fully-coupled hydromechanical analysis, where fracture 

conductivity is dependent on mechanical deformation and, conversely, joint water pressures 



 45 

affect the mechanical behaviour (Itasca 2004). In this code, it is assumed that rock blocks are 

impervious and that flow takes place only through the set of interconnecting discontinuities. 

Flow is modelled by means of the parallel plate model, and the flow rate per unit width is thus 

expressed by the cubic law. Total stresses are obtained inside the impervious blocks and 

effective normal stresses at the mechanical contacts.  

In this study, the fluid flow model in UDEC was used to analyse the steady-state seepage flow 

through the jointed rock foundation beneath the gravity dam studied. Analysis was carried out 

with a view to evaluating dam stability. A transient analysis was also carried out in order to 

determine flow times, but was inconclusive because the small timesteps required by UDEC 

make transient fluid flow analysis impractical in relatively large domains and with very small 

joint apertures, such as those necessary to analyse flow in dam foundations. 

Three-dimensional numerical analysis was carried out with the code 3DEC (Itasca 2003), the 

three-dimensional version of UDEC. 3DEC simulates the media as a group of convex blocks 

internally divided into tetrahedra with linear interpolation functions. The code 3DEC is 

particularly suitable to carry out stability analysis of arch dams, considering some 

discontinuities in the foundation. 

The main interest of the 3DEC code in dam foundation studies is to analyse failure 

mechanisms involving the rock mass discontinuities and the rock/concrete interface (e.g. 

Lemos 1999a; Resende et al. 2004). In mechanical modelling, the consideration of a few 

selected discontinuities is often sufficient to assess the safety conditions. For application to 

arch dams, special routines are included in 3DEC code (Lemos 1999a) which allow the study 

of the dam-foundation system, as the dam can be represented as a shell structure, represented 

by the FEM, and the foundation as a group of blocks. In the present study, 3DEC was used 

not only in mechanical analysis but also in seepage analysis, as it is useful to study the 

hydraulic behaviour with the same code which is used to carry out stability analysis. 

3DEC is capable of modelling water flow through the discontinuities (Damjanac 1996). In 

this study, however, an alternative equivalent continuum model was adopted. This new 

version of the 3DEC code, in addition to fracture flow models, allows the analysis of steady-

state flows through the blocks using an equivalent continuum model, including flows bounded 

above by a phreatic surface. In the equivalent continuum models it is assumed that the 

hydraulic head is the same at points of adjacent blocks with the same position, which means 

that it is assumed that from a hydraulic point of view joints between blocks have no influence 

on the numerical results. In the hydraulic models presented herein, the division into blocks 

has no physical meaning; it merely makes the mesh design easier. 



   46 

The choice of 3DEC for equivalent continuum hydraulic models is justified by the fact that 

the water pressure field thus obtained may be transferred to discontinuum mechanical models 

for stability analysis.

3 Collection and evaluation of data on the behaviour of dam 
foundations 

3.1 Introduction 

Observation is the most reliable means for assessing the safety of the structural system dam-

foundation-reservoir. This activity begins at the design stage, with the drawing up of the 

Monitoring Plan; continues in the construction stage, in which the previously defined 

instruments are installed and the main material properties are characterized; is of vital 

importance during the first filling of the reservoir, which is the structure’s first loading test; 

and continues throughout the lifetime of the dam. During construction, the main monitoring 

activities involve installing the instruments, controlling the effect of construction loads (such 

as self-weight, thermal loads mainly due to the placement of concrete, injection of contraction 

joints and foundation treatment), and characterizing material properties. Once the first filling 

of the reservoir has begun, observation is based on the study of different effects (such as 

displacements, relative movements of joints, drained water, strains and stresses), trying to 

establish the relation between each one of these and variations in the main loads. These main 

loads are also monitored, and for concrete dams under normal operating conditions are 

hydraulic pressure and variation in ambient (air and reservoir) temperatures. Foundation and 

dam structure are usually monitored as a whole, and the design of the foundation monitoring 

system is just part of the overall system (ICOLD 2005). 

Monitoring the main loads and structural effects requires installing equipment to measure 

different factors. The equipment and methodologies used to collect and collate the acquired 

data is called the monitoring system. This system includes all the sub-systems installed to 

observe and analyse changes in readings. The factors to be monitored in each dam are defined 

taking into account the dam type and size, specific project features and the risk factors 

associated to dam operation. Monitoring systems should be periodically updated according to 

the stage of the project and foreseen problems. 

In Portugal, the systematic observation of concrete dams began in around 1947, when the 

National Laboratory for Civil Engineering (LNEC) was founded, and followed international 

trends in dam observation.  The Monitoring Plans were designed with a threefold aim: i) for 

structural safety control; ii) to interpret dam behaviour; and iii) to verify some design criteria 

and improve knowledge on dam behaviour (Rocha 1964). This philosophy in the development 

of the Monitoring Plan has been followed since then, which explains the large amount of 

equipment installed in the majority of large concrete dams (Pedro 1999b). To detect changes 

in dam behaviour at an early stage, the number of factors to be measured is limited and the 



   48 

points at which readings are taken are carefully chosen. This is called the “quick observation 

programme” and usually includes the reading of displacements, movement of some joints and 

water pressures underneath the dam. In Portugal there are established rules and 

recommendations regarding the frequency of readings (RSB 2007).  

It is widely accepted that over the years a great deal of knowledge about dam behaviour has 

been obtained. On the other hand, the number of people involved in the safety assessment of 

dams is not enough to analyse the large quantity of information provided by the monitoring 

equipment. Therefore, the current trend in dam observation is to focus only on the really key 

monitoring parameters regarding the safety of each dam (Dunnicliff 1988; Nguyen 2003; 

Stateler 2006).  

Data collection, which is traditionally carried out manually with portable read-out units by on-

site personnel, is carried out at intervals defined according to the dam type, stage of the 

project, and current or foreseen problems. In addition to the measurements taken by 

instruments installed both in the dam and its foundation, periodic visual inspections in all 

accessible zones (crest, upstream and downstream faces, foundation, galleries, appurtenant 

works and reservoir) are essential. In several countries, including Portugal, in addition to the 

manual readings, part of the monitoring data of some large dams is now also collected by 

automated data acquisition systems (ADAS). Remote automated readings have several 

advantages, not least that they enable an almost continuous safety assessment of dams, 

providing the data obtained is appropriately transmitted, validated, stored, and processed 

(Farinha et al. 2004). If this is linked to an expert system, warnings can be given when 

abnormalities are recorded and corrective measures can even be suggested (Portela 2001). 

However, it should be noted that even with this kind of control visual inspections at dam-sites 

must be carried out at certain intervals. 

The evaluation of dam behaviour, particularly the foundation, and its safety assessment are 

greatly improved if the monitoring data is compared with predicted values by means of 

models, which conceptually simulate dam behaviour. These can be either numerical or 

statistical models. The first require realistic input parameters and the second a large number of 

monitoring results and substantial experience to support their application to a particular type 

of structure (Lemos 1999b).  

This chapter briefly presents the basis, the methods and the equipment for foundation 

monitoring, and the methodologies currently used in the analysis of concrete dam foundation 

monitoring data. Using the traditional simplified methods of quantitative interpretation, a 

procedure is proposed for the analysis of the recorded discharges, which takes into account 

the non-linear hydromechanical behaviour of dam foundations.

3.2 Safety control criteria 

The safety of a large dam must be ensured during the structure’s complete lifetime and 

therefore a series of measures are usually taken, beginning at the design stage, to fulfil both 

safety and serviceability requirements. Regarding the dam foundation there are three main 

scenarios of rock mass foundation deterioration to be concerned with (Pedro et al. 1989):  

i) cracking and movements within the rock mass associated with joint systems and 

faults,  

ii) absolute displacements of the rock mass surface and relative displacements of adjacent 

blocks of the dam which may affect the grout curtain or other watertight systems or 

the operating conditions of the equipment, and  

iii) seepage through the foundation and abutments, because this can lead to high uplift 

pressures, which destabilize the dam, or to potential high seepage velocities, which 

cause erosion. 

At the design stage, estimates of the hydraulic and mechanical behaviour of the dam 

foundation are obtained using adequate models and taking into account different scenarios 

which may occur. The hydromechanical behaviour of a rock mass on which a concrete dam is 

going to be built is always difficult to know until the first filling of the reservoir, despite all 

the investigation carried out at previous stages. It is therefore very difficult to establish rules 

to be followed by the designer. However, based on both design criteria and experience, there 

are established principals and general criteria that should be followed by the designer with a 

view to guaranteeing the dam safety. 

Particularly relevant is the distribution of water pressures along the base of the dam or along 

potential sliding surfaces in the foundation. At the design stage, full reservoir head can be 

assumed at the heel of the dam and zero or tailwater head, if any, at the toe of the dam. It is 

usually assumed that at the drainage line the head is equal to between one half and one third 

of the head difference between the heel and toe of the dam. Thus, a bi-linear distribution of 

the uplift pressure along the base of the dam is assumed. It is normal practice to use the value 

of one third of the head difference between the head and toe of the dam as this was 

established from data obtained in piezometric readings taken in the foundations of a number 

of both Tennessee Valley Authority and US Bureau of Reclamation dams (Casagrande 1961). 

A more conservative assumption, for an inoperative drainage system, is a linear distribution, 

i.e. a constant decrease in head between the heel and toe of the dam. The head distribution 

along the base of the dam depends mainly on the presence and efficiency of the drainage 

system. Several studies have been carried out by different bodies (Électricité de France 

(EDF), Swiss Committee on Dams (SCD) and Electric Power and Research Institute (EPRI), 



   50 

in the USA) regarding analysis of recorded uplift data. All of these studies, which are briefly 

presented along with the main results in European Club of ICOLD (2004a), were carried out 

because of the general acknowledgement that design assumptions have never been fully 

validated. Different criteria have been adopted by different bodies regarding the distribution 

of uplift pressures along the base of the dam, and great effort has been made in order to 

analyse the differences in the results (European Club of ICOLD 2004a; USACE 2000). 

According to the current Portuguese guidelines for dam design (RSB 2007) the dam safety 

should be assessed analysing its behaviour for normal operating and failure scenarios. For 

normal operating conditions it is required that the displacements and stresses in the rock mass 

close to the surface be relatively small, that the drained water through the foundation be such 

that it corresponds to an average permeability at the grout curtain area not higher than 1 LU, 

and that the uplift at the drainage line be lower than the equivalent of 1/3 of the hydraulic 

head upstream from the dam. For failure scenarios it is recommended that equilibrium exists 

in wedges defined by joints and faults for which movement is possible, that out-of-control 

flow of water through the foundation with high seepage velocity is not likely to occur, and 

that the drained water through the foundation is such that it corresponds to an average 

permeability at the grout curtain area not higher than 5 LU. 

Two of the above-mentioned requirements merit further comment: the first concerns the 

desired level of permeability and the second the uplift at the drainage line. Regarding the first, 

it is worth noting that the attempt to construct a grout curtain with a final water injection rate 

of 1 LU is considered inappropriate, as this can only be achieved by intensive and often costly 

grouting schemes and is only necessary in the special cases where the reservoir water is very 

precious or soluble rock is present in the foundation (ICOLD 2005). Regarding the second, 

the requirement that the uplift at the drainage line be lower than the equivalent of 1/3 of the 

hydraulic head upstream from the dam disregards the head of the toe of the dam, which may 

be significant, in particular in dams with a reservoir downstream. In this case, and at the 

design stage, it would be better to require that the pressure at the drainage line be lower than 

the equivalent of the tailwater head plus 1/3 of the difference between reservoir and tailwater 

heads. 

At the construction and operation stages, the foundation treatment and proper maintenance of 

the drainage system are essential to ensure the safety of the dam. Regarding stability, water 

pressures are the most crucial aspect, but discharge is also a relevant factor as it is correlated 

with seepage velocity, which should be limited in order to avoid erosion of material in open 

joints.  

For the evaluation of both grout curtain and drainage efficiency, Mascarenhas and Silva 

(1990) proposed a methodology which takes into account recorded discharges and water 



 51 

pressures. They mention that the three main aims of grout and drainage systems are: i) to 

reduce uplift pressures to values close to those foreseen in the design; ii) to restrict seepage 

velocity so as to keep erosion of material in discontinuities to a minimum, and iii) to restrict 

seepage through the foundation, taking into account functional and economic factors. To 

achieve these aims the following criteria are established at the design stage: i) the maximum 

hydraulic head allowed along the drainage line (?max), expressed in percentage of hydraulic 

head (percentage of hydraulic head is the ratio of the water head measured at a given level, 

expressed in metres of height of water, to the height of water in the reservoir above that level, 

as mentioned in the previous chapter, section 2.5.3); ii) the maximum allowable discharge per 

metre (qmax); and iii) the maximum global discharge (Qmax). If there is more than one drainage 

line, these criteria should be established for each of them.  

They suggest that a global index IG (IP; Iq; IQ) should be used in which:

(3.1) 

where ?0 max is the maximum percentage of hydraulic head recorded along the drainage line, 

q0 max  is the maximum recorded discharge per metre along the drainage line and Q0 the total 

recorded discharge. The three different sub-indexes, IP, Iq and IQ, are called pressure index, 

unitary discharge index and global discharge index, respectively. Different foundation areas 

can be analysed using these indexes. Mascarenhas and Silva stress the fact that the global 

index can only be used if the dam is adequately monitored, if there is confidence in the 

monitoring data and if detailed knowledge of the seepage pattern has already been obtained. 

The global index IG shows the actual effectiveness of both the grout and the drainage systems, 

and in the case of an efficient system each of the three sub-indexes IP, Iq and IQ should be less 

than or equal to 1. This methodology was used to analyse the efficiency of additional 

foundation treatment which had to be carried out in some Portuguese dams, due to excessive 

recorded discharges or water pressures (Fronhas arch dam, Venda Nova arch-gravity dam and 

Varosa arch dam), and in every case it was concluded that IG was significantly lower after 

treatment (Mascarenhas 1991; Mascarenhas and Silva 1990). It was also used to assess where 

additional foundation treatment should be carried out in Funcho arch dam (LNEC 1998b), and 

to assess the efficiency of the grout and drainage systems of the different structures of Alto 

Rabagão dam. This dam has an arch structure in the main valley and two gravity structures, 

one on each side.  

While the method is very simple and can be effective, the global index does, however, have 

three main drawbacks. Firstly, it takes both the maximum hydraulic head and discharges 

prescribed in the design as reference. However, despite all the investigation carried out prior 



   52 

to dam construction, it is impossible to predict the hydraulic behaviour of the dam foundation 

in normal operating conditions, and therefore the values established at the design stage should 

not be considered as “reference”. Secondly, it does not take into account the length of both 

drainage and piezometric boreholes, nor the depth at which the main seepage paths cross the 

boreholes. Finally, a high water pressure recorded in a piezometer may be localised and high 

water pressures are only relevant when acting on a horizontal discontinuity with a large 

surface, which encompasses the whole base of a dam block. It is worth noting that low water 

pressures recorded in a piezometer can be misleading in some cases, as is going to be shown 

in chapter 6.8. 

3.3 Foundation monitoring 

The first use of instruments in rock foundations of concrete dams was mainly for research 

purposes (Londe 1993). In fact, after the 2nd World War, with the construction of an 

increasing number of large dams, the amount of monitoring equipment to control structural 

behaviour increased significantly but most of the equipment was placed in the superstructure 

to confirm design hypotheses, and not in the foundation, as rock mass foundation 

characteristics were not taken into account until the sixties, when it was understood that 

serious accidents had occurred due to defective foundations.  

The mechanical and hydraulic behaviour of rock mass foundations is currently monitored 

with a group of techniques and equipment which allow the measurement of displacements and 

strains, uplift pressures, discharges, stresses, and physical and chemical properties of the 

water. Instruments are systematically installed for the follow-up of the actual behaviour 

during construction, the first filling of the reservoir and in the longer term. 

Regarding the equipment, it is necessary to measure both external loads and responses. The 

first type includes hydrostatic pressure, meteorological quantities, and seismic events; and the 

second, which indicate the behaviour of the dam foundation, includes mainly deformations, 

water pressures, and discharges. Measurable quantities and the different monitoring devices 

which may be installed are listed and briefly described in Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.2. 

Additional equipment is often installed in order to evaluate materials’ properties. 

Displacements are measured using geodetic methods or along lines and the different readings 

together, some of which are redundant, create a three-dimensional or spatial displacement 

measuring system. Regarding water pressures, it has to be taken into account that piezometric 

readings provide much localised information and can vary greatly from point to point, as they 

depend on the flow paths of water within the rock mass. Piezometers may be installed 

upstream and downstream from the drainage system, in order to measure the hydraulic head 

difference and therefore evaluate the efficiency of the seepage control measures. In Portugal, 



 53 

the majority of the piezometers installed in the foundations of concrete dams have a long 

single chamber and therefore give only one water pressure value, which is the result of the 

inflow and outflow of water from different strata or discontinuities which have different 

hydraulic heads. This type of piezometers, which are accessible to water over their whole 

length, although  not  recommended by the ICOLD (2005), remain widely used due to the fact  

 

 

Figure 3.1 – Monitoring deformations in concrete dam rock foundations (after ICOLD 2005). 



   54 

that multilevel piezometers, which allow measurement of water pressures in isolated sections 

of the holes, require demanding care in their design and installation. Only a few attempts have 

been made in Portugal to install multilevel piezometers, which are described in detail in 

chapter 6, section 6.8.1. Devices like the continuous borehole piezometer (Londe 1973c), the 

piezofor (Bordes and Debeuille 1987) and the piezodex (Kovari and Köppel 1987), which do 

not disturb the seepage pattern and allow the complete piezometric profile along a borehole to 

be logged, were mainly used for research activities.  

Part of the water flowing through the foundation is collected by the drainage boreholes, and it 

is recommended that partial discharges be monitored in addition to the total discharge as this 

procedure enables the identification of critical areas, if there is a sudden or gradual but 

consistent change in seepage rates. Physical and chemical analysis of both the reservoir and 

drained water are carried out in order to detect the occurrence of erosion or dissolution of 

materials either from the rock mass or the grout curtain.

3.4 Methodologies used in the collecting and evaluation of the monitoring 

data 

3.4.1 Collecting and collating of the monitoring data 

The Monitoring Plan establishes the frequency of readings which are usually carried out by 

expert teams on dam observation. In a first phase, readings are compared with maximum and 

minimum limits established either by the equipment’s measuring range or by previous 

readings. This allows measurements to be readily repeated and re-checked if there are major 

changes between subsequent readings, possibly using alternate readout equipment. Data 

collected should be checked a second time, as soon as it is entered into a computer system, by 

comparison with performance limits established case by case taking into account previously 

observed and predicted dam behaviour. 

The amount of data concerning each dam is very large and therefore several automatic 

systems have been developed worldwide for its management and analysis (e.g. Cadei et al. 

1990; Gallego et al. 2007; Huai-Zhi and Zhi-Ping 2005). In Portugal, an automatic system 

called GestBarragens has recently been developed with the aim of supporting the activities 

concerned with safety control in its various stages (Pina and Portela 2006; Portela et al. 2005). 

It results from a close partnership between three Portuguese bodies (LNEC; Instituto de 

Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores, Investigação e Desenvolvimento (INESC-ID); and 

Electricidade de Portugal (EDP)) and aims at obtaining, automatically, a diagnosis of the 

dam´s actual performance from analysis of all the information available, particularly that from 

the monitoring system, with a view to detecting possible changes of safety or functionality 

conditions. It is hoped that in the future GestBarragens will be linked to an expert system. 

3.4.2 Evaluation of the monitoring data 

The behaviour of a dam is only properly understood through the careful interpretation of the 

readings from the most relevant instruments. Analysis of readings over time allows the 

assessment of the dam behaviour, which is not only the best indication of how the dam is 

going to behave in the future but also provides a means to detect the occurrence of sudden or 

gradual changes in dam behaviour, which may require further attention. The current practice 

in studies of the behaviour of concrete dam foundations is: 

i) to analyse the monitoring data taking into account the variations over time of 

different measurements (such as total and partial discharges, uplift and 

corresponding percentage of hydraulic head, and displacements measured in 

inverted plumb lines and in foundation extensometers); 



   56 

ii) to compare measurements taken on different dates in which the main loads have 

similar values, and  

iii) to analyse the correlation between discharges and water level in the reservoir. 

Whenever possible, analysis is carried out in order to correlate readings taken in different 

instruments. This is the case of discharges and water pressures which are usually analysed 

together, as their simultaneous analysis provides an indication of the efficiency of both grout 

and drainage systems. Only in a few cases is the monitoring data compared with the results of 

numerical or physical models of the dam-foundation system.  

In addition to the above-mentioned analyses, it is also usual to perform statistical studies of 

quantitative interpretation of the recorded displacements. In fact, due to their simplicity, these 

methods have been extensively used in interpretation of dam behaviour. The next section 

presents a brief description of these methods and the studies carried out in order to analyse 

recorded discharges using quantitative interpretation are afterwards presented.   

3.4.3 Quantitative interpretation methods 

The main loads to take into account in the analysis of concrete dam monitoring results during 

normal operation are variations in the reservoir level and variations in ambient temperature. 

As these loads act simultaneously, the most representative structural behaviour effects 

measured on each date, namely displacements, strains and stresses, are the result of this 

coupled action. Therefore, to analyse and interpret concrete dam behaviour it is essential to 

separate and identify each one of the loads contribution to the observed effects. This 

separation can be easily done when the variation of one of the main loads is predominant, 

between two dates sufficiently close so that the effects due to variations of material’s 

properties over time or due to ageing process are negligible. In a systematic way, this 

separation can be done using effect separation methods, also named quantitative interpretation 

methods which, from the simultaneous consideration of a large number of monitoring results, 

try to establish a correlation between a given observed structural effect and the variations in 

each of the main loads.  

The first studies on dam behaviour using quantitative interpretation methods were published 

from 1955 to 1960, most of them in the 6
th

 ICOLD Congress (Ferry and Willm 1958; Rocha 

1956; Rocha et al. 1958a; Rocha et al. 1960; Rocha et al. 1958b; Service Construction 

Aménagements Hydroélectriques du Groupe Edison-Milan 1958; Tremmel 1958; Xerez and 

Lamas 1958). Most of these studies analysed displacements recorded in concrete dams, and 

tried to identify the elastic parts of the displacement due both to hydrostatic pressure and to 

variations in temperature linked to the annual thermal wave. The part of the displacement 

which could not be explained by the above-mentioned elastic parts was the “time effect”. A 



 57 

new procedure was later presented by the Italians, in which the correlations between the main 

loads and the structural effects took into account the results of structural models (Bonaldi et 

al. 1977; 1980a; 1980b; 1982; Fanelli 1979; Fanelli et al. 1979). Doboz (1982) and Ramos 

(1985) found a way to separate the part that could be explained by the non-elastic behaviour 

of the dam concrete from the time effect. Currently, work is focused on the development of 

models which include thermal corrections to the so called HST models (hydrostatic, seasonal, 

time models in which it is assumed that the seasonal thermal effects are properly modelled by 

a cyclical annual wave) by taking into account recorded temperatures. The need for these new 

models is based on the observation that the HST model is not entirely suitable when there are 

cyclic water level variations in phase with the seasonal thermal variations, and on the fact that 

the climate is changing and therefore dams are now subjected to unusual temperature 

conditions (Léger and Leclerc 2007; Penot et al. 2005). 

Quantitative interpretation methods have been widely applied and are the subject of numerous 

studies (e.g. Bonelli 2004; Breitenstein et al. 1985; Carrère et al. 2000; Crépon and Lino 

1999; De Sortis and Paoliani 2007; Florentino et al. 1971; Florentino et al. 1985; Gicot 1964; 

1976; Gomes 1981; Gomes and Matos 1985; Guedes and Coelho 1985; Hasegawa and 

Murakami 1988; Jinping and Zhenzhao 1988; LNEC 1961; Miike and Kobayashi 1989; Pedro 

et al. 1984; Perner et al. 2001; SCD 2003; Serafim et al. 1962; Silveira 1965; Silveira and 

Pedro 1964; Silveira et al. 1981; Widmann 1967; Willm and Beaujoint 1967) and, although 

different assumptions and techniques have been used, the simplicity of the method and the 

accuracy of the results reported over time have shown that these methods are a powerful tool 

in the analysis of concrete dam behaviour. 

These methods have been classified according to the materials´ rheologic behaviour, mainly 

as elastic and visco-elastic, or according to the structural numerical models on which they 

rely, as statistical, deterministic, and mixed. In statistical models the main loads’ effects are 

represented by means of functions that are completely independent from one point to another. 

These methods are purely empirical, therefore requiring chronological series of readings of 

the different variables over a sufficiently long period of time. The series of cause and effect 

quantities are then correlated by means of regression techniques. In deterministic models the 

main loads’ effects are represented by functions obtained from the results of numerical 

models, so they are not totally independent from one point to another. Mixed methods 

combine the fundamental features of the statistical and deterministic methods, for instance 

making use of a statistical formulation relative to one of the main loads and a deterministic 

formulation relative to the other. Detailed description of quantitative interpretation methods 

and of the above-mentioned models can be found in Gomes (1981), Castro (1997) and SCD 

(2003)  and therefore only the basic formulation of the statistical elastic method is presented 

here. 



   58 

Quantitative interpretation studies are carried out during periods when there are no events that 

may lead to significant structural changes, such as earthquakes or rehabilitation of the 

foundation or of the dam body. In terms of both concrete and foundation behaviour, of which 

the properties change over time, this requires the use of mean values of the parameters 

relative to their behaviour. When an elastic structural behaviour is expected, it is assumed that 

(Gomes 1981): 

i) the most representative factors of the structural behaviour, in normal operating 

conditions, can be separated into two parts, one elastic (reversible and 

instantaneous) mainly due to variations in hydrostatic pressure and temperature, 

and another non-elastic (irreversible), which is exclusively a function of time; 

ii) the effects due to variations in hydraulic pressures and temperature can be studied 

separately.  

In the first hypothesis, time effects are considered to be independent of changes in the main 

loads, and therefore the analysis of dam behaviour can first be carried out examining the time 

effects. In many dams this is a simplification, for example in the case of concrete creep in 

which a significant part of the time effects depends both on changes in reservoir level and on 

concrete properties. The second hypothesis is based on the assumption that materials have an 

elastic behaviour, which is confirmed for the level of stresses that occur in concrete dams in 

normal operating conditions. 

In elastic methods, the different effects associated to an observation date i, on a given point, 

are related by means of a function of the type: 

? ? ? ?????
??????

i j k

kkjjii

iitiihiiii

rktpcgbhfa

rktUUhUthU

)()()(

)()()(),,(

?

?? ?

 

(3.2) 

where Ui (hi,?i,ti) is a given observed effect observed on date i, which depends on the 

hydrostatic pressure, the temperature and the moment when the data is collected, and Uh(h), 

U?(?) and Ut(t) represent, respectively, the parts due to the elastic effect of variations in 

reservoir water level, due to the elastic effect associated with thermal variations and due to the 

time effect with the starting point at the beginning of the period under analysis. Each one of 

these parts can be approximated by pre-established sums of level, temperature and time 

functions, fi, gj, and pk, and depend on the coefficients ai, bj and ck, which need to be 

calculated. Separation of effects requires the consideration of the constant k due to the fact 

that on the observation reference date the calculated value is not zero. The residue ri 

represents the deviation between the value observed on date i and the result of the quantitative 



 59 

interpretation model. Thus ri represents observation errors and errors due to model’s 

unsuitability. 

Coefficients ai, bj and ck are determined through the calculation of a system of n equations, in 

which n is the number of selected observations. The system of equations can be solved by the 

Gauss criterion which establishes the parameters that minimize the sum of the squares of the 

errors ri (least square method). In a quantitative analysis a reference date has to be given in 

order to calculate the time effect. This date must be prior to the first date considered in the 

analysis, but the curves obtained are the same regardless of the given date, as the result is 

adjusted with the independent term (k). 

Quantitative interpretation methods can be used in the analysis of concrete dam measurement 

data with the following purposes (Florentino 1983):  

i) automated control of future dam behaviour;  

ii) validation of numerical structural models; and  

iii) analysis of evolution in dam behaviour.  

Regarding the first above-mentioned purpose, as the results of quantitative interpretation of 

monitoring data define a structural behaviour model of the dam, the safety assessment of the 

dam can be made automatically by comparing the observed values on a specific date with the 

predicted values obtained from the quantitative interpretation of previously measured data.  

Concerning the second, to validate numerical models, influence lines due to the water 

pressure and due to thermal loads, determined from the quantitative interpretation of 

monitoring data and from the numerical model, are compared. The quantitative interpretation 

covers a range of levels in the reservoir, which should be uniformly distributed. The 

comparison between influence lines due to the water pressure calculated with the quantitative 

interpretation and with the numerical model, for the same range of levels in the reservoir, 

allows the correction of the numerical parameters, which makes the use of the numerical 

model in the prediction of the dam behaviour possible. Finally, as regards development in 

dam behaviour, analysis can first be carried out examining the time effect, which is 

asymptotic and in most cases can be explained by the concrete rheologic behaviour or by 

ageing processes. However, in this analysis it must be taken into account that the non-elastic 

effects that may exist can be statistically divided between the different parts negatively 

affecting the quality of the interpretation.  

Quantitative interpretation methods are typically used in the analysis of displacements of 

concrete dams. Displacements reflect a structural global behaviour and are influenced both by 

variations in reservoir level, which can be established using quantitative interpretation 



   60 

methods and compared with the results of a numerical model, and also by variations in 

ambient temperature. The time effect is in most cases mainly a concrete creep effect which 

can be analysed and characterised from the results of tests carried out in creep cells, either in 

situ or in laboratory, or can also be an ageing process, such as swelling. Although not often 

applied in practice, statistical modelling can also be used to analyse strains and stresses. On 

this subject, Oliveira (2000) presented a new formulation to interpret recorded strains with a 

view to converting them into histories of stresses, which was later implemented by Moura 

(2005). In observed factors which do not correspond to linear structural responses, such as 

joint movements, piezometric levels, uplift and discharges, the use of quantitative 

interpretation methods is not current, as in these cases the principle of superposition of effects 

is not valid. 

Foundation monitoring results include foundation movement, water pressures and seepage. 

The use of statistical models of quantitative interpretation to study the behaviour of the 

foundation, taking into account the monitoring data, has almost been limited to the analysis of 

displacements recorded with plumb lines and foundation extensometers. The foundation 

movement close to a dam is treated in a similar manner to dam body movement, which means 

that the same influence functions and governing variables considered in the prediction of the 

dam body displacements are generally used (SCD 2003). It is not easy to use these methods to 

study the hydromechanical behaviour of dam foundations as this behaviour is non linear, due 

to the influence of stress on permeability and to the possible time gap between the variation in 

the main loads and the variation in the measurement data. This raises doubts regarding the 

application of the principle of superposition of effects. 

3.5 Quantitative interpretation of recorded discharges 

3.5.1 Previous studies 

The difficulties regarding the quantitative interpretation of discharges and water pressures 

were highlighted by Fanelli (1979) who came to the conclusion that the interpretation of 

seepage and uplift using deterministic models was not always satisfactory because the elastic 

scheme very often did not work for the foundation rock mass. This was all the more evident 

when the mechanical properties of the rock were weak. He therefore thought that statistical 

models should be used after being adjusted to the peculiarity of foundation behaviour. He 

highlighted that equipment installed within the foundation rock mass often showed long time 

lags and hystereses in relation to variations in external factors (such as variations in reservoir 

level) and therefore a simple correlation between synchronous values of causes and effects 

would generally be inadequate. Memory effects would have to be introduced. Fanelli thought 

that much development and research work was still necessary in this field. Since this 

statement, only a few attempts have been made using statistical modelling in the analysis of 



 61 

piezometric levels and seepage discharges recorded in concrete dam foundations. Some of 

these studies are briefly referred to in the following paragraphs. 

Breitenstein et al. (1985) analysed discharges recorded in five large concrete dams of the 

same hydro-electric development using a method of quantitative interpretation in which not 

only the reservoir level and ambient temperature measured on each date are taken into 

account but also their variation in the preceding weeks. 

Drain discharges and water pressures recorded in the foundation of Cabril arch dam were 

analysed using a procedure in which the influence line of the hydrostatic pressure obtained 

with a quantitative interpretation was adjusted taking into account results from a numerical 

model. The same procedure was used in the analysis of discharges and water pressures 

recorded in the foundation of Venda Nova arch-gravity dam (Gomes and Matos 1985). 

Figure 3.3 shows that the numerical results obtained in both cases are very close to the 

recorded data.

dam and b) Venda Nova dam, and comparison with recorded discharges (adapted from 

Gomes and Matos 1985).

Guedes and Coelho (1985) predicted the piezometric pressure recorded in a piezometer 

installed in the Funil dam and the seepage discharge close to the Itaipu dam spillway, both in 

Brazil, using simple methods with only a water height and time. However, to take into 

account a time lag between the variation in water levels and variations in water pressures and 

discharges, the water level prevailing 15 days before the date of the prediction was used in 

pressure analysis and the average water level from days 6 to 11 prior to the day of the 

measurement was used in analysis of discharges. Results of the quantitative interpretation of 

discharges are shown in Figure 3.4. 

Silva (1988) made quantitative interpretations of discharges recorded in the foundation of 

Cahora Bassa arch dam, in Mozambique, in which the effect of the hydrostatic pressure was 

represented by a polynomial curve. This was obtained taking into account the curve which 

represented the variation in the total discharge due to the variation of the reservoir level 

during a period in which the latter had increased significantly. Piezometric readings were 

analysed using the same procedure. 

Lombardi et al. (2008) applied an algorithm developed to analyse the functional delays 

observed in the behaviour of concrete dams, especially those related with the thermal field, in 

the analysis of discharges recorded in the foundation of an arch dam. A delay of about six 

days was used for the part of the discharges caused by variations in water level, obtained by 

an optimisation process.

More generally, it is accepted that water pressures depend on the foundation deformations. 

They are thus, theoretically, influenced by the same variables: reservoir level, concrete 

temperature and time. Whenever seepage discharge is influenced by precipitation, it is 

appropriate to include this as a variable (SCD 2003). 

3.5.2 This study 

An attempt was made to analyse recorded discharges using methods of quantitative 

interpretation, taking into account the non-linear rock mass hydromechanical behaviour. As 

with displacements and stresses, it was decided that the main loads to take into account in the 

analysis of discharges during normal operation are variations in the reservoir level and 

variations in ambient temperature (variations in ambient temperature cause changes in the 

structure’s temperature, which may give rise to dam displacements that affect the dam 

foundation deformation, and thus the aperture of the discontinuities through which water 

flows). The time effect, which when analysing dam displacements can often be explained by 

the rheologic behaviour of dam concrete or by a swelling process is, in the case of discharges, 

due to unpredictable effects. These can be changes in seepage paths caused by clearing, 

erosion or dissolution (as in the case of Venda Nova dam mentioned in the previous chapter), 

or more commonly, clogging of both seepage paths and drainage boreholes, and can not be 

correlated with variations in the main loads nor be represented by any curve or law. The 

cyclic variations in both the water level in the reservoir, due to the dam operating regime, and 

in annual temperature, add complexity to the dam foundation behaviour as they also 

contribute to changes in seepage paths. 

Clogging of seepage paths over time is a commonly observed phenomenon in concrete dam 

foundations. In fact, during dam operation very fine materials settle on the reservoir bottom. 

This fine sediment flows through the foundation discontinuities and when it arrives close to 

the grout curtain it settles, causing a natural blockage of the discontinuities with very small 

apertures, which were impossible to fill with cement grout. This phenomenon occurs from the 

grout curtain towards upstream and is favourable to the dam, as it improves the grouting 

effect and reduces the quantity of water flowing through the foundation. This natural blockage 

is enhanced when the discharges are low, with low seepage velocities. However, clogging of 

the drainage system can be a problem, especially if this leads to an increase in water 

pressures. 

In this chapter, the shape of the influence line of the hydrostatic pressure on discharges in a 

concrete dam foundation is presented. Using polynomial functions whose graph adequately 

follows the shape of the above-mentioned line, a series of quantitative interpretation analysis 

was carried out, taking into account the thermal and time effects in addition to the effect of 



   64 

hydrostatic pressure. Discharges recorded in both single drains and seepage measuring weirs 

of two large Portuguese dams were analysed.  

A program for quantitative interpretation was purposely developed for this study, with the 

programming language Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) that can be used within 

Microsoft Excel. The program was developed in order to analyse all the scalar quantities 

usually recorded in dam surveillance. Several different functions were considered in order to 

represent the effect of the hydrostatic load, and of the thermal and time effects. The functions 

to use in each analysis can be easily and quickly chosen. Program validation was carried out 

with a comprehensive comparison of results with those of other available codes. The program 

was developed in such a way that the use of any new functions found useful whilst developing 

the study could be easily introduced into the code. 

3.5.3 Variations in discharges due to variations in the reservoir level 

Due to the hydromechanical behaviour of rock masses, the permeability depends on the state 

of stress and strain within the foundation and, consequently, discharges vary with these 

changes in rock mass permeability. The permeability of the rock mass in the upstream area, 

close to and underneath the heel of the dam, is often greater than that at the downstream area, 

which causes variations in permeability along seepage paths. In order to be able to separate 

the effect of the hydrostatic pressure on discharges, the shape of the non-linear curve which 

represents the relation between the water height in the reservoir and the quantity of water 

collected in a concrete dam drainage system was established using a two-dimensional 

discontinuous model of a dam foundation, in which the normal stiffness of the foundation 

discontinuities was varied so as to assume rock mass foundations with different deformability. 

This model and the numerical simulations carried out are described in detail in chapter 7. 

Figure 3.5 shows the model of Pedrógão gravity dam used in this analysis. Due to lack of data 

a much idealised fracture pattern was assumed. 

Three different rock mass foundations were considered, with the same geometry but with 

discontinuities’ normal stiffness varying 100 times (kn = 1 GPa/m, kn = 10 GPa/m and 

kn = 100 GPa/m). A friction angle (?) of 30° was assumed in the foundation discontinuities, 

and the joint aperture at nominal zero normal stress (a0) and residual aperture (ares) were 

adjusted in such a way that the discharge at the drainage line with a low reservoir level (only 

10 m of water height) was the same for the three different models. Numerical simulations 

were carried out applying successive increments of water head at the reservoir bottom and of 

hydrostatic pressure in the upstream face of the dam so as to simulate the rising of water in 

the reservoir. In the three different cases this load path was followed by an unload path, 

simulating the filling and subsequent emptying of the reservoir.

Figure 3.5 – Model of a concrete gravity dam on a jointed rock foundation. 

Figure 3.6 a) shows the different curves obtained with the different foundation rock masses. 

Due to the great difference in drain discharges, only the shape of the curve obtained with the 

most deformable foundation is clearly identified. Therefore, in order to make the shape of the 

three different curves visible, discharges calculated with the three different models were 

divided in each case by the highest discharge. Figure 3.6 b) clearly shows that variations in 

reservoir level at low levels do not give rise to the same discharge variation when the water 

level in the reservoir has an equal increase, but is at a higher level. As expected, the curves 

tend to be linear for the lower reservoir levels as discontinuities’ normal stiffness increases. A 

linear relation between discharge and reservoir level would only be obtained in a 2D 

numerical simulation in which the flow between the reservoir and the drainage line were 

confined, in a rock mass with constant permeability and when the hydromechanical effect 

were not taken into account.  

A series of different polynomial curves was adjusted to those shown in Figure 3.6, in order to 

define the function that better fits the numerical results (Figure 3.7). In the most deformable 

foundation, in which the discontinuities’ normal stiffness is 1 GPa/m, it was found that a 

function of the type q = f (h
4
) would roughly fit the numerical results. Curves defined by 

polynomials in which the linear or the quadratic terms are considered are not adequate for the 

lower reservoir levels, as the derivative at the origin is almost zero. However, in this case, 

these types of curves match the numerical results well for reservoir levels higher than 25 m. 

Such deformable concrete dam foundations do not actually exist, as concrete dams are built 

on rock masses which are not easily deformed when subjected to high stresses. In the stiffer 

foundations, polynomials of the type h
3
 + h or h

4
 + h are adequate, as their graphs 

approximately follow the curves which represent the variation in discharges due to variations 

in reservoir level.   



   66 

Figure 3.8 shows the variations in discharges during a cycle of filling and emptying of the 

reservoir. There are slight differences in the discharges calculated in the load and unload 

cycles, due to the non-linearity of the model. These differences, however, are: i) lower than 

1.7 % for the stiffest foundation, ii) lower than 10 % for the rock mass with the normal 

stiffness of the discontinuities equal to 10 GPa/m, except for a water height of 5 m, in which 

the difference is around 15 %, and iii) for the most deformable foundation, lower than 10 % 

for the highest reservoir levels. In this latter case, the difference increases for the lower water 

levels, but as such foundations are not likely to exist it can be concluded that with the 

assumed friction angle (? = 30°), which is close to friction angles commonly observed in rock 

masses of average quality (Hoek 2001), the behaviour concerning drain discharges is almost 

elastic and therefore the use of quantitative interpretation methods is feasible.

3.5.4 Quantitative interpretation of discharges recorded in Alto Lindoso dam 

3.5.4.1 Main characteristics of Alto Lindoso dam 

Alto Lindoso dam, designed and owned by EDP, is located on river Lima in the north of 

Portugal and is part of a hydraulic power system which consists, in addition to the dam, of a 

hydraulic circuit and an underground powerhouse. It is a double curvature arch dam, almost 

symmetrical, with a maximum height of 110 m, a total length of 297 m between the 

abutments at crest elevation and a width that varies at the central cantilever between 4 m at 

the crest and 21 m at the base. The dam was concluded in 1991 and the first filling of the 

reservoir took place from 6 January 1992 to 28 April 1994. 

The foundation consists of granite with medium to coarse-sized grains and is of good quality, 

showing, however, some heterogeneity. The main joint sets in the left bank and valley bottom 

are in the upstream-downstream direction, with average to sub-vertical dips, and in the right 

bank they are sub-vertical and equally distributed between upstream-downstream and right 

bank-left bank directions.

Forty four drains were first drilled from the drainage gallery, two per block, with the 

exception of the foundation of block 14-15, in which four boreholes were drilled. The length 

of the drainage boreholes is around 38 m in the valley bottom and 20 m in both embankments, 

which in each case is about 2/3 of the length of the grout curtain. Permeability values of 3.0 to 

7.0 × 10
-8

 m/s were obtained in Lugeon type tests carried out in drains.  

3.5.4.2 Monitoring and hydraulic behaviour of the dam foundation 

As prescribed in the monitoring plan, 22 piezometers were installed from the downstream 

area of the drainage gallery, one per block, with the exception of the central cantilever (block 

11-12) in which two piezometers were installed, one vertical and the other dipping towards 

upstream. During the first filling of the reservoir, percentages of hydraulic head of about 30 to 

40 % were recorded in the valley bottom in the foundation of blocks 12-13, 13-14 and 14-15. 

The greatest discharges were recorded in the foundation of blocks 10-11, 11-12, 12-13 and 

14-15, in the valley bottom, which make up around 50 % of the total discharge in the drainage 

gallery.  

After the first filling of the reservoir, high percentages of hydraulic head were still recorded in 

the foundation, in the valley bottom, below dam blocks 11-12, 12-13 and 13-14, and in the 

right bank, below block 18-19. These percentages of hydraulic head, however, were not 

accompanied by significant discharges. Between March and May 1998, new drains were 

drilled in those areas, to reduce water pressures, and a new piezometer was installed in the 

foundation of block 11-12. Work carried out allowed not only a significant decrease in water 

pressures in the foundation of the blocks in the bottom of the valley but also an improvement 

in the drainage of the foundation of block 18-19. More recently, in January 2004, due to an 

increase in piezometric readings, the drains located in blocks 7-8 and 8-9 were cleaned and 

unblocked when necessary. Further cleaning was carried out in June 2005 in all drains and 

piezometers located in blocks 6-7, 7-8, 8-9, 14-15, 15-16, 16-17, 17-18 and 18-19. Figure 3.9 

shows the drainage and piezometric systems in the dam foundation. 

The drained water, together with that from leakage, is collected in three seepage measuring 

weirs, which separate the discharges by specific areas (Figure 3.9): the first measures the 

discharges from the left bank, between blocks 1-2 and 9-10; the second those from the right 

bank, between blocks 14-15 and 21-22 and the third collects not only the water from the first 

two, but also that collected in the valley bottom. In this dam, the quantity of water from 

leakage is very low. Figure 3.10 shows recorded discharges in these three seepage weirs 

plotted versus time. The same figure shows the variation in the reservoir level. Chart analysis 

shows that discharges have been decreasing, most probably due to clogging of both the rock 

mass discontinuities and the drainage system.

3.5.4.3 Quantitative interpretation of discharges recorded in a single drain 

In Alto Lindoso dam, the highest discharges are recorded in the foundation of the blocks 

located in the valley bottom. The only block in which no drains or piezometric boreholes have 

been drilled since the beginning of the first filling of the reservoir is block 10-11 and thus the

decision was made to analyse discharges recorded in drain D10/11.1 located in this block 

(Figure 3.9). Although the opening of new drains can affect the flow pattern in quite a wide 

foundation area, it was assumed that in the foundation of block 10-11 there had been no 

significant changes, which allowed quantitative interpretation of recorded discharges to be 

made taking into account discharges recorded since the beginning of reservoir filling. Figure 

3.11 shows the variation of recorded discharges and water pressures in block 10-11 over time. 

Discharges in both drains have been decreasing (drains D10/11.1 and D10/11.2 shown in 

Figure 3.9). The water pressure in piezometer P10/11 (Figure 3.9) increased from the end of 

1998 until the beginning of 2003, but has apparently been stable since then, varying with the 

variations in the reservoir level. The percentages of hydraulic head recorded at this 

piezometer are lower than 16 %, and therefore of no concern. 

The study started with a very simple quantitative interpretation with the effect of the 

hydrostatic pressure represented by a function of h
3
 + h and the time effect represented by a 

cubic polynomial (t
3
, t

2
, t). A series of quantitative interpretations was afterwards carried out, 

only changing one function or introducing one new function each time, in order to analyse its 

influence on the results. Different periods of time were used to calculate the curve that better 

fits recorded data in each analysis. This curve was used to predict discharges, and these 

predictions were compared with discharges measured in the subsequent period of time.

Figure 3.12 to Figure 3.16 show results of some experiments in which curves calculated with 

data recorded until the end of 2003 were used to predict discharges from then until mid-

February 2008. These figures, in addition to the influence lines of each effect, show the 

parameters which define the calculated curve, the comparison between recorded and both 

calculated and predicted discharges, and the errors of the analysis. Similar charts are at the 

same scale, in order to make comparisons easier. The independent term (k), was added to the 

time effect.  

Results of the first interpretation carried out are shown in Figure 3.12. The effect of the 

hydrostatic pressure was afterwards represented by a function of h
4
 + h, instead of h

3
 + h 

(Figure 3.13). A third analysis was carried out in which the thermal effect was included 

(Figure 3.14). This was simulated with the simplified method developed by Willm and 

Beaujoint (1967), in which the thermal effect in each point of the structure is assumed to be 

independent and seasonal, taking into account that in the Portuguese climate the most 

important wave is that of annual period (Teles 1985). The time effect was then represented by 

an exponential curve and by a both linear and exponential curve (Figure 3.15 and Figure 

3.16). Analysis of the above-mentioned figures together shows that: 

1. the effect of hydrostatic pressure is of the same order as the time effect; 

2. the hydrostatic pressure effect can be either simulated by a function of h
3
 + h or of 

h
4
 + h and, in this case, the linear term is dominant; 

3. the thermal effect is very low; 

4. the time effect is well approximated by a cubic polynomial. 

The general trend in discharge variations is reasonably approximated by the first three 

interpretations, in which the time effect is represented by a cubic polynomial. However, the 

calculated curves do not fit recorded discharges well neither in the period of the first filling of 

the reservoir, in which there are significant differences between recorded and calculated 

discharges, nor in the subsequent period. None of the curves was considered adequate to 

predict discharges, as errors increase in the period in which predictions are made. In reality, a 

quantitative interpretation is an interpolation, only valid in the range of variation of the main 

loads and over the period of time considered in the analysis. In some cases, like those 

presented here, quantitative interpretations can not be used as a model to predict future 

behaviour.

3.5.4.4 Quantitative interpretation of discharges recorded in seepage measuring weirs  

Results of quantitative interpretations of discharges recorded in single drains were not 

satisfactory and therefore an attempt was made to interpret the total discharge, recorded in 

seepage measuring weir 3. In a first interpretation, the effect of the hydrostatic pressure was 

represented by a function of h
3
 and the time effect by a cubic polynomial (Figure 3.17). In this 

case the effect of hydrostatic pressure becomes significant, unlike what was observed in 

analysis of discharges in a single drain, in which it was close to the time effect. However, the 

time effect is not well fitted and predictions are not good. An exponential curve was then used 

to simulate the time effect and the results were much better, as shown in Figure 3.18. 

However, for the highest and lowest discharges, the calculated flows are higher than those 

recorded (the calculated curve exaggerates the peaks), which means that the effect of the 

hydrostatic pressure is higher than it should be. Taking this second interpretation as reference, 

another two were carried out by adding a linear term to simulate the time effect and by taking 

into account the thermal effect (Figure 3.19 and Figure 3.20). Figure 3.19 shows that when a 

linear term in h is used the curve which represents the effect of the hydrostatic pressure does 

not make sense, due to the lack of recorded discharges for water heights in the reservoir lower 

than 72 m. In this case, quantitative interpretations are better carried out with the effect of the 

hydrostatic pressure represented by a function of h
3
. As in the analysis of seepage in a single 

drain, the thermal effect is very low (Figure 3.20).

Most of the studies developed in this thesis were carried out with data from Alqueva dam, 

which is described in detail in the next chapter. Therefore, only the features relevant to the 

quantitative interpretation of discharges are referred to here. Alqueva dam is a 96 m high 

double curvature arch dam of which the foundation consists of green schist and phyllite. Dam 

construction ended in 2003 and the first filling of the reservoir began in February 2002 and is 

nearly complete. There are five drains per dam block, located 3 m apart. The total discharge is 

around 100 to 150 l/min, of which around 20 l/min are from the valley bottom. 

3.5.5.2 Quantitative interpretation of discharges 

The study carried out included quantitative interpretations of discharges recorded in the drain 

of the valley bottom that collects the highest quantity of water (drain D25 D) and of 

discharges collected in the drainage gallery in an area which encompasses the bottom of the 

valley. Recorded discharges are shown in Figure 3.21, where it can be seen that there are large 

variations in discharges which are not justified by variations in the reservoir level. Figure 3.22 

to Figure 3.25 show results of some interpretations.

In the case of Alto Lindoso dam the time effect is well approximated by a cubic polynomial 

because there are no significant variations in recorded discharges. In Alqueva dam, there are 

large variations in discharges which are not justified by variations in the reservoir level, 

therefore a simpler function, such as a logarithm or an exponential, is more adequate to 

simulate the time effect. 

The study was carried out in a similar manner to that in Alto Lindoso dam. Due to the large 

variations in recorded discharges, a simple logarithmic or an exponential function is more 

adequate to simulate the time effect than a cubic polynomial curve, which tends to adjust to 

variations. Figure 3.22 shows the results of both interpretation and prediction of discharges in 

drain D25 D. In this case, the time effect is around half of that due to hydrostatic pressure and, 

although the calculated curve follows a pattern close to that defined by recorded discharges, 

the prediction deviates from monitored data. Much more accurate predictions can be obtained 

with discharges recorded in the valley bottom, as shown in Figure 3.23. Figure 3.24 shows 

that, as in the case of discharges recorded in seepage measuring weir 3 in Alto Lindoso dam, 

the linear term in h can not be used. As expected, the thermal effect is very low, as shown in 

Figure 3.25, but the predictions are better when it is taken into account.

3.6 Summary and conclusions 

Monitoring of dams, including both visual inspections and measurements taken by 

instruments, helps safety evaluation of dams and their foundations as it enables dam 

behaviour to be assessed and predictions to be made (ICOLD 2005). Simplified methods 

traditionally used in the interpretation of the monitoring data, such as quantitative 

interpretation methods, are relevant not only to evaluate measured behaviour but also to detect 

changes in dam behaviour at an early stage, so that corrective measures can be taken in due 

time. The study presented in this chapter focused on quantitative interpretation of discharges, 

and for this the shape of the influence line of the hydrostatic pressure on discharges in a 

concrete dam foundation was first established using a numerical model. Using polynomial 

functions of which the graph adequately follows the shape of the above-mentioned influence 

line, a series of quantitative interpretation analysis was carried out. Discharges recorded in 

both single drains and seepage measuring weirs of two different dams were analysed. The 

study carried out highlighted the difficulties in interpreting recorded discharges, as they are 

not the sum of a series of structural responses which can be clearly identified, but despite this 

the following conclusions could be drawn:  

i) the effect that variations in reservoir level have on discharges is adequately 

simulated by polynomials of the type h
3
 + h or h

4
 + h, except when there is a lack 

of recorded discharges for lower water levels in the reservoir, in which the effect is 

better simulated by a function of  h
3
; 

ii)  the effect that variations in ambient temperature have on discharges is very small, 

and can often be neglected; 

iii) discharges recorded in single drains are largely due to localised flow behaviour 

and, unlike what happens with dam displacements, in which in most cases the time 

effect can be correlated with a variation in dam concrete deformability  over time, 

the time effect does not necessarily reflect an increase or decrease in the 

permeability of the discontinuities which cross the drain being studied. 

When applied to the analysis of discharges, the method of quantitative interpretation is far 

more limited than when used in the analysis of dam displacements, due to the great influence 

that the part given by the time effect plus the independent term has on the results. In fact, 

when analysing displacements, this part is usually significantly lower than the effect of 

hydrostatic pressure, while in the analysis of discharges presented here it is about half of that 

due to hydrostatic pressure.  However, results show that this type of analysis can be useful. 

Indeed, it is concluded that the quantitative interpretations may be used to approximately 



 89 

predict discharges collected in seepage weirs in a short period of time in which it can be 

assumed that the trend of the time effect will remain the same. 

Quantitative interpretations were carried out for discharges recorded in Alto Lindoso and 

Alqueva dams and in both dams it is evident that for a given water level, the highest 

discharges are recorded when that level is reached for the first time. This can be due to the 

higher rate of variation of the reservoir level, which occurs during the first filling of the 

reservoir, and which may have an influence on the unblocking of seepage paths.  

The analysis was based on the assumption that discharges vary instantaneously with 

variations in the main loads. In fact, readings of discharges in Alto Lindoso dam, taken with 

an automated system in a short period of time in which there were significant changes in the 

reservoir level, were compared with the part due to variations in hydrostatic pressure obtained 

in a quantitative interpretation (Figure 3.26) and it was concluded that, in this case, there was 

no time lag. Results shown in Figure 3.26 are from a quantitative interpretation similar to that 

presented in Figure 3.18, in which the effect of the hydrostatic pressure is represented by a 

function of h
3
, the thermal effect by a seasonal wave, and the time effect by an exponential 

curve. 

Additionally, an attempt was made to calculate the time necessary to reach steady-state in a 

hydromechanical analysis, using the code UDEC and the model which was referred to in 

section 3.5.2. Analysis, of which the results are shown in Figure 3.6 to Figure 3.8, was carried 

out with a highly efficient special algorithm within UDEC that converges rapidly to the steady 

state. In transient analysis, the explicit step by step algorithm requires the fluid timestep to be 

limited, so as to ensure numerical stability. This timestep is given by:

where V = domain volume; Kw = water bulk modulus; and the summation of the UDEC 

permeability factors ki is extended to all contacts surrounding the domain. In UDEC, a 

“domain” is a segment of a joint (domain volume = joint aperture × length of joint segment). 

The minimum value of all the timesteps over all the model’s domains is used in the analysis. 

In the case studied, the timestep is around 10
-8

 s and the time required to run 1,000,000 cycles 

is around 2 hours. Flow time is obtained by multiplying the number of cycles by the timestep, 

and therefore a run time of two hours only simulates 0.02 s of flow. Therefore, transient fluid 

flow analysis is impractical in relatively large models and with small joint apertures, such as 

those necessary to analyse flow in dam foundations. 

The influence lines due to the hydrostatic effect should represent the permeability of the area 

being analysed. Additional studies could include quantitative interpretations carried out for 

different periods of time, gradually longer, but using the same functions to represent the two 

main effects. This would lead to different influence lines of the hydrostatic effect that should 

only change slightly from one analysis to another, and could be a way of quantifying 

phenomena such as clogging of the rock mass. Another issue that requires further attention 

when analysing discharges collected in measuring weirs is the fact that for different reservoir 

levels the water may be collected from a different number of drains. Quantitative 

interpretation should be carried out always using the same drainage system, which means that 

only water collected in a limited number of drains, probably those from the lower parts of the 

dam, should be used in the analysis.  

This study shows that it is not possible to predict discharges recorded in single drains, as they 

are largely due to local effects and do not represent the permeability of the rock mass. 

Therefore, discharges recorded in seepage weirs, collected in relatively large areas, rather than 

discharges in single drains should be analysed. In fact, leakage measurement is only 

representative over a certain area, and can be considered an integral factor, reflecting the 

behaviour of the foundation at more than just one point. In this study quantitative 

interpretations were only carried out for discharges, as these are more useful for the 

evaluation of foundation performance than water pressures taken in piezometers, which give 

only pointwise information (ICOLD 2005). 

The study leads to the conclusion that with quantitative interpretation analysis it is difficult to 

obtain calculated discharges very close to those recorded. However, the general trend in 

discharge variations is easily obtained and the results of this type of analysis can be used to 

roughly predict discharges in short periods of time. 



 91 

Recently, other techniques have been proposed to support the assessment of the field data and 

results of quantitative interpretation of dam displacements have been compared with those 

obtained using both the neural network approach, in which the model “learns” from the 

information contained in a training set of data provided by the user (Mata 2007; Perner et al. 

2001), and with algorithms which combine a model selection procedure based on the 

minimization of the simulation error and a pruning mechanism for the elimination of 

redundant terms (Piroddi and Spinelli 2003). These methods may be an alternative, or an 

additional means, to analyse dam behaviour and particularly discharges.

4 Borehole water-inflow tests 

4.1 Introduction 

The information which is most commonly available regarding the hydraulic performance of 

dam foundations, namely discharges in the drains and piezometric readings, does not give a 

clear indication of seepage patterns underneath the dam (ICOLD 2005). Therefore, to obtain 

detailed information, it is necessary to carry out further tests. Fluid flow in rock masses is 

usually investigated in situ performing hydraulic or tracer tests (Bedmar and Araguás 2002; 

Committee on Fracture Characterization and Fluid Flow 1996; Ghobadi et al. 2005). In 

hydraulic tests, which are commonly used to obtain estimates of hydraulic conductivity, some 

changes are artificially induced into a restricted area of the foundation and the resulting 

responses are measured. Borehole water-inflow tests are one of the types of test which can be 

used to study in situ hydraulic properties and the way in which flow occurs within dam 

foundation rock masses. These tests may provide valuable information about seepage patterns 

within operating dams’ foundations and offer the great advantage of not inducing any change 

in the rock mass. 

This chapter starts by describing borehole water-inflow tests, followed by a description of a 

series of tests carried out in the foundation of two large Portuguese concrete dams: Alqueva 

arch dam and Pedrógão gravity dam. The main aims of these procedures are presented, along 

with a reference to the equipment necessary to carry out the tests, the way they should be 

prepared and conducted, and the key factors to take into account when analysing and 

interpreting results, in order to obtain the largest quantity of information possible. A reference 

is made to some studies carried out in three other Portuguese dams where the conclusions 

drawn from the results of borehole water-inflow tests were of major importance. The main 

characteristics of both Alqueva and Pedrógão dams are presented, with emphasis on those 

related with the foundation. This information is essential not only to analyse test results but 

also to understand studies presented in the three subsequent chapters, which are based on both 

the dimensions and boundary conditions and/or on data recorded in these dams. Tests were 

carried out in a series of drainage and pieozometric boreholes, and the analysis of results led 

to a detailed knowledge of seepage patterns in some foundation areas. A brief description of 

tests and results is presented for each borehole, followed by results analysis. The main 

difficulties found whilst carrying out tests are referred to and a series of conclusions are 

drawn from the tests done in situ.

4.2 Borehole water-inflow tests 

4.2.1 Main aim and brief description of tests 

The main aim of borehole water-inflow tests is to understand the flow pattern in a specific 

area of the foundation. These tests involve only measuring the discharges and water pressures 

in isolated sections of boreholes and are carried out with the aid of a packer, which consists of 

an expandable element, usually of stiff, fiber-reinforced synthetic rubber, through which a 

pipe extends. The packer is inflated inside the borehole at a pre-established level, therefore 

allowing the isolation of different test intervals within the borehole. 

Tests can be carried out with either single or double packers: in the first case the test interval 

is defined by the bottom of the borehole and the packer and in the second is the area between 

the two packers. When a single packer is used, tests are usually conducted by raising the 

equipment and so the length of the test interval is gradually increased. Figure 4.1 shows, as an 

example, some different stages of water-inflow tests using both single and double packers: 

steps 1, 2 and n allow the measurement of discharges above the upper packer and at the test 

interval, defined either by the packer and the bottom of the borehole (step 1) or by the 

distance between the two packers (steps 2 and n); step n+1 allows the measurement of both 

water pressure at the test interval and quantity of water flowing into the hole above the 

packer. The test is conducted in a single borehole, considering and isolating fixed test 

intervals and testing the hole in consecutive sections along its length. For each test interval, 

flow rates and water pressures are recorded until steady state conditions are achieved. While 

testing, discharges and water pressures are also recorded in the nearby drains and piezometers, 

respectively, which are kept working as normal.

4.2.2 Testing equipment 

Equipment used to carry out borehole water-inflow tests was initially developed for the oil 

production industry, but its use has spread to other fields, currently being used in permeability 

tests, hydraulic fracture tests, grouting for foundation treatment, and in studies of 

contamination, with the collecting of water samples at various depths (Ask et al. 2009; 

Giacomel and Rowe 1992; Rowe 2000; Rowe 2001). In addition to the packer, which is the 

main piece of the equipment used in these tests, it is also necessary to have equipment to 

i) check the borehole, before carrying out tests; ii) place and keep the packer in position in the 

borehole; and iii) measure discharges, water pressures and piezometric levels. A detailed list 

of the equipment required is presented in Appendix 1.  

Packers can either be mechanical or hydraulic, depending on the method used to inflate them, 

but hydraulic packers are easier to handle and allow larger dilations. The inflation medium, 

which is usually water but can also be oil, air, or nitrogen gas, is introduced between the 

central pipe that goes through the packer and the expandable rubber. The packer’s central pipe 

is screwed to a series of other pipes, linking the test interval to the borehole head. In this way, 

either the flow rate into the test interval or water pressures can be measured in borehole 

water-inflow tests. 

The choice of the equipment to carry out tests depends on a series of geometric restrictions 

and on the rock mass jointing pattern. In concrete dams, tests are usually carried out in 

drainage galleries, and therefore geometric restrictions include: i) the diameter of the pipe at 

the borehole’s head; ii) the borehole’s diameter; iii) the size of the galleries where tests are to 

be carried out; and iv) the inclination of the axis of the borehole in relation to the gallery floor 

and sidewalls. In embankment dams, tests are usually carried out in the open air, therefore 

only the first two above-mentioned restrictions need to be taken into account. The packer, 

single or double, should have a length which is compatible with the jointing pattern and a 

suitable diameter, so as to ensure that, when inflated, the test interval is properly isolated. 

According to Wittke (1990), a common difficulty when carrying out hydraulic tests with 

packers is leakage between the packer and the borehole wall, due to a lack of inflation, or 

between the test interval and other test branches, through the surrounding rock mass (Figure 

4.2). The use of long packer rubber sleeves and hydraulic packers limits leakages, because 

their greater ability to expand allows greater pressure against the borehole wall.  

In this study, tests were carried out with a double packer with a diameter of 56 mm, and 

expandable rubbers 0.5 m long. With the aid of a metallic stopper, the equipment is easily 

assembled as a single packer. The packer was chosen due to its suitability to conduct tests in 

boreholes with a diameter of 76 mm, which is the usual dimension of the drainage boreholes, 

with pipes at the head with an interior diameter of 65 mm. The packer has four extension 



   96 

pipes, which are easily screwed together, and allow test intervals of different lengths (1 m, 

3 m, 4 m and 5 m). The water pressure is measured with a pressure transducer, calibrated for 

readings from 0 to 20 bar, located 0.825 m above the top of the test interval. The scale of the 

pressure transducer was chosen so as to be suitable for the maximum water pressures 

expected in Portuguese dams, in which the equipment is going to be used. The water flowing 

into the test interval can reach the borehole’s head through a series of PVC pipes. Figure 4.3 

shows the main parts of the equipment and its geometry is shown in Appendix 1.  

4.2.3 Preparation of tests and test procedures 

Borehole water-inflow tests must be carefully prepared taking into account: i) the specific 

information required; ii) the particular features of the dam where tests are going to be carried 

out; and iii) test procedures.  

As the main aim of borehole water-inflow tests is to obtain information on how seepage 

occurs in a certain area of the dam foundation, testing is therefore carried out in a series of 

boreholes located in that area and the various test results are analysed and interpreted 

together. At the preparation stage, it is essential to check if there is any impediment to carry 

out tests in any borehole, such as boreholes filled with coarse sand or with geodrains. 

Regarding the dam where tests are going to be carried out, it is necessary to ensure the 

stability of the dam when performing the tests. This is particularly significant in gravity dams, 

because they are designed to resist the horizontal thrust of the water entirely with their weight. 

However, uplift forces, which may increase while testing, reduce the stabilizing effect of the 

structures’ weight. Available geotechnical information of the area to be studied should also be 

carefully analysed, as well as variations in discharges and water pressures, and their relation 

with the reservoir level. This analysis not only allows better knowledge of the foundation 

area, but also shows which equipment should be used, namely, pressure gauges with scales 

and precision suitable for the expected water pressure and sizes of measuring cylinders. 

There are no pre-established testing methods, thus the tests were developed within this study 

to provide information which can be useful in the analysis and safety assessment of any dam 

foundation. Test procedures, which were continuously corrected and improved while carrying 

out the tests presented in the next sections, are described in detail in Appendix 1. The test has 

five main stages: 

i) firstly, it is necessary to measure discharges and water pressures, not only in the 

borehole which is going to be tested but also in the boreholes located in an area 

larger than that its expected area of influence, before placing the equipment;

   98 

ii) then, a piece of metal with the same diameter as the equipment called “blind 

device” has to be inserted into the borehole to check for and remove, if possible, 

any obstructions, to make sure that the equipment will fit; 

iii) thirdly, tests are conducted with a single packer; 

iv) then with a double packer; 

v) and finally it is necessary to repeat all the measurements referred to in i) again to 

verify if the testing process has altered the seepage pattern. 

After tests in a series of adjacent boreholes have been carried out, when some knowledge 

about seepage in the area in analysis has already been obtained, it may be of interest to 

conduct new tests in some borehole branches, so as to shed light on or confirm hypotheses 

concerning seepage paths. In these new tests, some changes may be introduced into test 

procedures depending on various circumstances which may arise: i) if there is any borehole 

area which needs to be analysed in depth, the length of the test interval should be decreased; 

ii) to confirm the existence of seepage paths linking a test interval and adjacent boreholes, it 

may be necessary to introduce same changes either in the drainage or piezometric systems, by 

closing or opening boreholes; and iii) when water does not reach the borehole’s head, it is 

possible to obtain information on seepage velocity within the test interval being studied, 

increasing the water column and carrying out Lefranc type tests. 

It is not easy to estimate the time necessary to carry out tests, as discharges and water 

pressures should only be taken in steady sate conditions. The period of time necessary to 

achieve this state depends on the rock mass permeability: in areas where it is low, it may take 

various hours or even days; in more pervious foundation areas, steady-state conditions are 

quickly achieved. Tests also take longer when the borehole being tested is linked to a large 

number of other boreholes, as discharges and water pressures must be measured not only in 

the borehole being tested but also in the boreholes located in its area of influence.   

Borehole water-inflow tests can be carried out at any time during the year. However, when 

planning the tests, it should be taken into account that discharges are higher for higher water 

levels. In arch dams, tests are better carried out with high reservoir levels and during the 

winter, when the ambient temperature is low, as, due to arch dams’ behaviour, this is when 

the aperture of the discontinuities within the rock mass close to the heel of the dam is greater.  

4.2.4 Analysis of test results 

Analysis of borehole water-inflow test results should be carried out in a qualitative way, 

examining recorded data, interpreting charts which can be drawn and checking the 



 99 

consistency between conclusions drawn from tests and other available information, such as 

geological and geotechnical data of the dam site, boreholes logs, information given by the 

borehole driller, and results of other complementary tests, including electrical conductivity 

tests and chemical analysis of water. 

Data collected during tests in successive borehole test intervals allows the drawing of the 

following type of charts: i) discharges and water pressures in the equipment placed in the area 

of influence of the borehole being tested; ii) discharges and water pressures measured in the 

borehole; iii) discharge flowing into each of the borehole´s test intervals; iv) accumulated 

discharge from the bottom to the head of the borehole; v) discharge above the test interval; 

and vi) variations in water pressures along the borehole. Analysis of charts may provide 

information on: 

i) the depth at which the main seepage paths cross the boreholes; 

ii) the distribution of discharges and water pressures along the boreholes; and 

iii) seepage paths linking different boreholes. 

With the simultaneous analysis of water pressures and discharges it is possible to draw 

conclusions concerning seepage through discontinuities: i) high water pressures and low 

discharges are due to seepage through discontinuities with a very low aperture; ii) high water 

pressures and discharges reveal that the grout curtain is probably inefficient and that there are 

high seepage velocities; on the contrary, low water pressures and discharges may either reveal 

that there is an efficient grout curtain, that the rock mass is in the process of becoming more 

impervious due the settlement of sediment within discontinuities, or that the boreholes are 

clogged; iii) low water pressures and significant discharges show that discontinuities within 

the foundation are quite open, and that the high quantity of water flows a long way, with high 

pressure losses. In this case, it can also be concluded that the drainage curtain is in good 

condition. 

Valuable additional data can be obtained with water electrical conductivity tests, which are 

easily and quickly carried out. Taking into account LNEC´s experience, these tests may 

provide information about the depth at which seepage paths cross each one of the boreholes 

when discharges are between 0.20 and 3.0 l/min. Discharges lower than 0.20 l/min make 

seepage paths undetectable and higher than 3.0 l/min lead to similar readings along the 

borehole, due to the consequent high water velocity.

4.2.5 Previous use of borehole water-inflow tests in Portuguese dams  

This section examines some studies carried out in three Portuguese dams (Figure 4.4) where 

the performance and analysis of a series of tests, among them borehole water-inflow tests, 

were of major importance. Despite the fact that the first two are embankment dams, they are 

referred to in this section because when dams have their foundations in rock masses there is 

no difference between results analysis of tests carried out in either concrete or embankment 

dams.

Beliche dam is located on River Beliche, in the Algarve, in the south of Portugal. It is a zoned 

earth-rockfill dam, with a maximum height of 54 m, slightly curved along its length. The 

foundation rock mass consists of schist and greywacke. The reservoir water is used for 

irrigation and water supply. The construction of the dam finished in 1986 and the first filling 

of the reservoir in December 1988. 

About five months after the conclusion of the first filling of the reservoir, in May 1989, a 

leakage was detected in the downstream face of the dam, close to the right bank, at around 

mid-height of the dam. To understand where the water was coming from and suggest, if 

necessary, a suitable treatment, the additional monitoring equipment, which had already been 

studied, was re-analysed and a series of tests was carried out while opening new piezometric 

boreholes in the vicinity of the leakage. To obtain data about the location and relative aperture 

of the discontinuities responsible for the water leaking, borehole water-inflow tests with a 

double packer were carried out. To analyse the seepage paths by trying to detect connections 

between different discontinuities and between the injection area and other boreholes or 

between the injection area and the leakage, injection tests with single packers and tracer tests 

were also carried out. Furthermore, water samples were collected and physical and chemical 

properties of the water in the foundation and of the leakage were compared (Pinto et al. 1991). 

The tests were carried out, mainly to detect the seepage path towards the leakage. If the 

seepage path was through the dam body it would be necessary to take some measures to avoid 

piping. The  results  of  the  injection  and  borehole water-inflow tests  and  of  tracer tests  

led to the conclusion that the seepage path towards the leakage crossed the foundation, which 

is a schistose rock mass, with a low probability of erosion. As the high uplift pressures 

recorded were not a danger to the dam stability and safety, no foundation treatment was 

suggested, and it was decided that it would be sufficient to control the discharges in the 

leakage over time. In the tracer tests carried out, although different tracers were used, it was 

only possible to draw some conclusions from the use of sodium chloride. The tests led to the 

conclusion  that   the   dye   tracers  were  adsorbed  onto   the   foundation  rock  mass.  Some

deficiencies were found during the borehole water-inflow test performance related to the 

small size of each packer (only 20 cm) and to the difficulty of pumping water from the test 

interval (Pinto et al. 1991).  

4.2.5.2 Santa Águeda dam (Marateca dam) 

Santa Águeda dam, also known as Marateca dam is located on the River Ocreza, about 15 km 

to the north of Castelo Branco, the capital of Beira Baixa. The construction of the dam was 

concluded in 1991. It is a homogeneous earth-fill dam, with a dipping filter in the downstream 

slope. The dam has a total length of 1054 m and a maximum height of 25 m. Water is used to 

supply Castelo Branco and for irrigation. The foundation consists of granite with two micas, 

mainly biotitic. 

In this dam, after about five years of use, some leakages were detected in the downstream area 

of the dam, close to the right bank. The analysis of the uplift pressures recorded in different 

piezometers led to the conclusion that there could be significant seepage through the 

downstream slope of the dam. If the interstitial pressures were high this seepage could lead to 

hydraulic lifting and progressive erosion of material from the rock mass discontinuities. Thus, 

to monitor interstitial water pressures, it was decided to install new piezometers in that area of 

the embankment (LNEC 1997b). 

To identify the main seepage paths and to evaluate the way in which seepage occurred along 

the boreholes, different tests were carried out, namely injection tests and borehole water-

inflow tests. The tests were carried out in breaks between drilling. The rotary drilling was 

done with water and allowed the recovery of rock samples. The identification of the 

discontinuities and of the areas of highest permeability made it possible to choose the best 

place for the piezometric chambers in each borehole (LNEC 1997b). 

4.2.5.3 Funcho dam 

Funcho dam is located on the River Arade, close to the city of Silves, and is part of the 

Odelouca-Funcho system, of the Algarve Hydraulic Development, which provides water 



   102 

supply, for irrigation, for a large area of the Algarve. It is a double curvature arch dam with 

artificial abutments and a thick base. The dam has 49 m of maximum height, 165 m of 

development at the crest and the thickness varies, in the central cantilever, from 6.5 m at the 

base, to 2.25 m at the crest. The retention water level is 96.0 m. The dam construction ended 

in 1991 and the first filling of the reservoir, which started at the beginning of November 1992, 

was only concluded in January 2001. The foundation rock mass, highly heterogeneous and 

anisotropic, consists of schist and greywacke (DGRAH 1978).  

The long period taken for the first filling of the reservoir was due to the need for successive 

foundation treatments, which made it necessary to hold the filling (LNEC 2005a). Foundation 

treatment included injections in the concrete/rock mass interface, consolidation and grouting. 

The first strengthening of the grout curtain was done in 1992 because, before the beginning of 

the first filling of the reservoir, with the reservoir at a relatively low elevation, high flow rates 

were recorded at the drainage curtain (LNEC 1990). At the beginning of 1996, with the 

reservoir at an elevation of 94.0 m, the filling of the reservoir was halted again, due to some 

local high flow rates. The design of the second strengthening of the grout curtain was done by 

the dam owner, Instituto da Água (INAG), who requested that the dam designer, COBA, 

revise the design and give technical assistance and that LNEC analyse the dam behaviour 

while the foundation treatment was being carried out (LNEC 1998b). 

After carrying out a series of borehole water-inflow and injection water tests in various 

drainage boreholes, the foundation treatment was slightly altered (LNEC 1998a). The tests 

carried out gave some information about the probable efficiency of injection with cement 

grout. This information made it possible to avoid the drilling and injection of some boreholes, 

which had previously been defined. In one of the areas tested instead of opening and injecting 

new boreholes it was decided to inject the bottom of two different drains which were too long 

and extended below the lower part of the grout curtain, thus reducing the total discharge. This 

injection was done without reducing the drainage efficiency, as the water pressure due to 

water entering the bottom of the boreholes, was very low. The results of the borehole water-

inflow tests led to a detailed knowledge of the main seepage paths which allowed not only the 

reduction of costs but also the reduction of the time required to conclude the foundation 

treatment. 

4.3 Main characteristics of the dams where tests were carried out 

Borehole water-inflow tests were carried out as part of this study in Alqueva and Pedrógão 

dams, both owned by Empresa de Desenvolvimento e Infra-Estruturas do Alqueva (EDIA) 

and designed by EDP (EDP 1988; EDP 1994; HIDRORUMO 1999; HIDRORUMO 2001; 

Miranda and Maia 2004). Both dams are located on the River Guadiana, in the southeast of 



 103 

Portugal and are part of a multipurpose development designed for irrigation, energy 

production and water supply. 

Alqueva dam is the main structure of the development and creates the largest artificial lake in 

Western Europe, with storage capacity of 4150 hm
3
 and a surface area of 250 km

2
 at the 

retention water level, of which 215 km
2
 are in Portugal and 35 km

2
 in Spain.  

Pedrógão dam is located about 23 km downstream from Alqueva dam, and creates a reservoir 

with storage capacity of 54 hm
3
 which not only allows the turbines of Alqueva dam to work 

in a reverse motion, by pumping water from the downstream to the upstream reservoir, but 

also provides water for irrigation and for energy production. It is the first roller compacted 

concrete (RCC) dam built in Portugal. 

4.3.1 Alqueva dam 

4.3.1.1 General description of the dam 

Alqueva dam is a double curvature arch dam, with artificial abutments. The structure is 

extended on the left bank by a group of gravity blocks where a surface spillway is inserted, 

followed by a structure which closes the valley. The dam has a maximum height of 96 m, a 

total length of 348 m between the abutments at the crest elevation, and a length of 140 m in 

the bottom of the valley (Figure 4.5, Figure 4.6 and Figure 4.7). Figure 4.8 shows the dam’s 

central cross section. The dam width is 7 m at the crest, while at the base it varies from 30 m 

at the central cantilever to 33 m at the abutments. The crest is located at an elevation of 

154.0 m and carries a road which links the towns of Moura and Portel. The powerhouse is 

located at the toe of the dam. Downstream from the dam is a concrete dam-wall, with a 

maximum height of 55 m, which protects the powerhouse and the substation from the 

downstream reservoir, created by Pedrógão dam (EDP 1994).  

The dam has 35 independent concrete blocks: 24 in the arch, 3 in the right abutment, 4 in the 

left abutment and 4 in the closing structure of the left bank. It has four main inspection 

galleries, GV1 to GV4, with floors at elevations of 147.0 m, 126.0 m, 105.0 m, and 84.0 m 

respectively, and a drainage gallery (GGD) which is aligned with the insertion of the dam in 

the foundation and has its floor, at the lowest level, at an elevation of 61.0 m. In the 

abutments, the galleries GV1, GV2 and GGD are split into two galleries, one close to the 

upstream face of the dam and the other one approximately halfway between the upstream 

gallery and the downstream face of the dam. In the bottom of the valley the drainage gallery is 

also split into two galleries, one close to the upstream face and the other one known as the 

downstream drainage gallery (GDJ). The latter extends towards the right bank in a branch 



   104 

excavated into the rock mass. The dam-wall has a drainage gallery with the floor in the area 

downstream from the powerhouse at an elevation of 42.0 m. 

In the bottom of the valley the interface concrete/rock mass is at an elevation of 58.0 m, 3 m 

below the floor of GGD, with the exception of the area at the heel of these blocks, where a 

foundation plinth 6 m wide was built with its base at an elevation of 55.0 m. At the top of the 

plinth (58.0 m) there is a peripheral joint (concrete-concrete joint) introduced to avoid vertical 

stresses in the foundation with the filling of the reservoir. The width of the peripheral joint 

varies from one block to another, from 7.25 m up to 9.0 m (Figure 4.9).  

The construction of the dam began in 1997 and ended in 2003. The first filling of the reservoir 

began in February 2002 and is still not finished, because, after reaching a water level of 150.0, 

the dam began operating in normal conditions. Officially the first filling of the reservoir will 

only finish when water reaches the retention water level, at 152.0 m.

4.3.1.2 Geological-geotechnical conditions 

Detailed geological and geotechnical investigation was carried out at the dam site between 

1960 and 1995, when the tender for the dam and powerhouse construction was opened. The 

studies included site reconnaissance investigation and foundation characterization. Several 

borehole core drilling surveys were carried out, with a total drilling length of 3750 m, most of 

them simultaneously doing Lugeon type tests. LNEC conducted a series of in situ and 

laboratory tests. In situ tests included geophysical surveys (seismic refraction spreads, seismic 

tomography and electrical resistivity soundings) and foundation deformability evaluation 

(plate loading (jacking) tests on exposed rock galleries, flat jacks inserted into exposed rock 

surfaces, and borehole jacks with dilatometer) (LNEC 1970; LNEC 1973; LNEC 1975; 

LNEC 1986; LNEC 1995). Laboratory tests were conducted to evaluate anisotropy and to 

determine shear strength (UCS, ?, and c). The shear strength of discontinuities was also 

studied in the laboratory (LNEC 1984). While excavating and building the dam and the 

powerhouse, more geological and geotechnical investigation was carried out, mainly in the 

left bank where the main fault within the project area is located (LNEC 1998a; LNEC 1999b; 

LNEC 1999c; LNEC 2002; LNEC 2003; Neves and Gonçalves 2002). 

The foundation is heterogeneous and consists of good quality green schist in the right bank 

and the river bottom and of quite good phyllite, with a higher deformability, in the left bank. 

According to in situ tests carried out prior to dam construction the foundation Young’s 

modulus in the left bank varied from 6 to 20 GPa, and the foundation of the right bank and of 

the bottom of the valley had a Young’s modulus greater than 20 GPa (Liberal et al. 2002; 

LNEC 1973; Neiva et al. 1997). Table 4.1 shows the average cohesion and friction angle of 

discontinuities in the two different foundation areas. The area of the phyllite is more fractured 

and is crossed by several faults, the most important being fault 22, which corresponds to the 

green schist/phyllite interface.

 107 

The phyllite has a very visible schistosity, striking N40°-60°W and dipping 15°-50°NE, 

although it can go up to 70°NE at specific zones. The green schist looks highly dense and, in 

general, schistosity is barely evident and subparallel to bedding planes. There are, however, 

some local zones where these rocks have a very visible schistosity which corresponds in most 

of the cases to inclusions of chlorite schist (EDP 2006). 

Various sets of rock joints were identified, of which the most prevailing are: A) N40?-65?W, 

12?-65?NE; B) N75?W, S75?W; 65?N-90-55?S; C) N65?-90?W,12?-55?NNE; 

D) N20?-42?W, 65?-90?ENE and E) N25?-55?W, 65?SE-90? (EDP 2003). Figure 4.10 shows 

the average position of the main sets of rock joints in relation to the dam. Several faults, 

aligned with some joint sets, are shown on the surface foundation map, especially in the left 

bank, but their width is, in general, less than 10 cm, with the exception of fault 22. This latter 

is, in fact, not a single fault but a geological entity bordered at hanging and foot by two almost 

parallel faults, with a filling of highly deformable phyllite and with widths lower than a few 

tenths of centimetres, although locally larger than 1 m. The material between these two faults 

is fractured and crushed phyllite. The width of this geological entity varies between 3 and 

12 m, and the dip angle can be close to 45°. The main faults/fault zones observed, shown in 

Figure 4.11, and the sets of rock joints to which they belong are (EDP 2006):  

- zone of fault 22 (set C) in the left bank, below the arch and the abutment; 

- fault 66 (set A) in the left bank, crossing the foundation of block 1-2; 

- fault 29 (set D) in the left bank, crossing the foundation of block 1-2; 

- zone of faults17/18 (set A) in the central zone of the bottom of the valley, crossing 

the dam foundation (blocks 12-13 and 13-14) and the powerhouse foundation; 

- fault 19 (set A) in the bottom of the valley, crossing the powerhouse foundation 

and the dam foundation, below blocks 10-11 and 11-12. 

Most of the joints in phyllite belong to set A, with a short trace length (&amp;lt;10 m), small gaps 

(&amp;lt;0.20 m) and smooth to slightly rough surfaces. In the green schist joints show a very high 

persistence (&gt; 20 m), with spacing larger than 0.60 m and have rough to very rough surfaces 

(EDP 2006). 

The surface foundation map was prepared using the terminology and symbols suggested in 

(ISRM 1978; ISRM 1981), and, according to these classifications, the right bank and valley 

bottom foundation rock mass, where the green schist occurs, is fresh to slightly weathered 

(W1 to W2) and the mean distance between successive discontinuities measured along an 

intersecting straight line is wide to moderate (F2 to F3). Close to the main faults the fracture 



   108 

spacing decreases (F4 to F5). In the left bank foundation, which consists mainly of phyllite, 

the degree of weathering at the surface is W2 to W3. The fracturing intercept of the phyllite 

is, in general, F4 to F5 and, less frequently, F3 to F4.

4.3.1.3 Foundation treatment 

Foundation treatment consisted of consolidation of faults, general consolidation of the rock 

mass in the area of the dam and of the downstream dam-wall, contact grouting, and the 

installation of a grout curtain and a line of drainage boreholes. Due to the importance of fault 

22 in the structural behaviour of the dam, a special treatment was carried out which included 

the excavation of a set of galleries, the removal of the material inside the fault and its 

replacement with concrete (LNEC 1995; LNEC 1998a; Muralha et al. 2003). Eight 

longitudinal galleries were excavated (levels 1 to 7 and 4a shown in Figure 4.12) from which 

a series of lateral widening areas were excavated, and filled with concrete. The longitudinal 

galleries were sub-horizontal, in the dam axis direction, and were excavated downwards, from 

the upper levels to the lower ones. The longitudinal galleries were also filled with concrete 

while the treatment was being carried out, with the exception of two galleries which were 

later used for grouting and which remain open for inspection purposes. Figure 4.12 shows 

design drawings of fault 22 treatment.

The treatment of faults 66 and 29 together consisted of placing a concrete block at the base of 

block 1-2. Treatment of fault 17 consisted of placing concrete blocks in the foundation of the 

dam and of the powerhouse and in grouting the fault along its dip to a maximum depth of 

28.5 m. A small concrete block was also built in the foundation of blocks 10-11 and 11-12, to 

treat fault 19. The foundation of the downstream dam-wall was also subjected to treatment, 

which included a grout curtain and a drainage curtain, drilled from the foundation gallery. 

To evaluate the effectiveness of the foundation treatment, geophysical tests were carried out 

before and after the treatment in vertical boreholes drilled at the base of each one of the 

blocks. The method of crosshole and surface to borehole tomography by seismic waves was 

used. Results showed that after treatment the field of the velocities of compression waves was 

more homogeneous and that the lowest velocities had increased. While drilling the above-

mentioned boreholes, Lugeon type tests were carried out at several depths (after dam 

construction but before beginning the grouting injections). The analysis of the results made it 

possible to identify zones with different permeability: 2.0 × 10
-7

 m/s down to about 5 m in 

depth; varying from 2 to 1 × 10
-7

 m/s between 5 and 10 m in depth; and lower than 

1.0 × 10
-7

 m/s for depths greater than 10 m. 

The grout curtain was drilled from the drainage gallery, from gallery GV2 at the base of the 

blocks which include the surface spillway of the left bank, and from the right bank. The 

boreholes are located 5 m apart and the average length of the grouting boreholes was 41.0 m, 

varying from 26 m to 60 m. In the left bank, in the area of fault 22, secondary boreholes were 

drilled halfway between consecutive primary boreholes, and tertiary boreholes. After 

grouting, the majority of the permeability values obtained in Lugeon type tests conducted in 

the vicinity of the treated area, whilst drainage boreholes were being drilled, were lower than 

1.0 × 10
-8

 m/s. 

To relieve uplift pressures at the base of the dam, drainage boreholes with a diameter of 

76 mm and located 3.0 m apart were drilled from the drainage gallery, the downstream 

drainage gallery and gallery GV4.  

Figure 4.13 shows the drainage system in Alqueva dam foundation. From gallery GV2, at the 

base of the blocks which include the surface spillway of the left bank, drainage boreholes 

were drilled 6.0 m apart. Due to some difficulties found while drilling, a geodrain was placed 

in every borehole of the drainage curtain drilled from the left abutment to the base of block 

8-9. From joint 8, in the valley bottom, to the right bank, boreholes were drilled from the 

GGD with a dip direction of 257? and dipping 85? (dip direction defined clockwise from 

north, and dip defined as the angle from the horizontal). The average length of the drainage 

boreholes is 27.2 m, varying from 18 m to 52 m.

4.3.1.4 Foundation behaviour monitoring 

The monitoring system of Alqueva dam includes the measurement of the main loads, namely 

the reservoir level, both the ambient and reservoir water temperature and the seismic 

parameters (acceleration time history obtained from three-component strong-motion 

accelerographs), and of the following hydraulic and structural effects: water pressures, 

discharges, concrete temperature, displacements, joint movements, strains and stresses. In 

addition, some creep cells were installed within the dam body in order to evaluate the 

deformability characteristics of the concrete placed in situ. Two specific Monitoring Plans 

were developed for the follow-up of the actual behaviour during the treatment of fault 22 and 

during the first filling of the reservoir. 

In the dam foundation, displacements are measured with 9 inverted plumb lines (Figure 4.14), 

12 borehole (rod) extensometers, and 6 incremental extensometers (Figure 4.15) (LNEC 

1997a). The hydraulic behaviour of the dam foundation is analysed measuring the discharges 

along the drainage system and the water pressures in a network of piezometers. Piezometers 

were drilled from the drainage gallery, one per dam block, located 15.0 m apart, 

approximately halfway between joints (Figure 4.16). They were installed immediately 

downstream from the drainage curtain, and at the same distance from adjacent drains. A 

further two piezometers were installed in seven of the blocks (25-1D, 21-22, 17-18, 13-14, 

8-9, 4-5 e 1E-1) in order to allow measurement of water pressures along the upstream-

downstream direction. Sets of piezometers were also installed at the substation slab and at the 

downstream dam-wall. 

The dam’s structural behaviour has been as expected based on studies carried out at the design 

stage and type C1 predictions (Lambe 1973) from recently developed specific models taking 

into account measurements recorded during construction. Since June 2005, with the water 

level in the reservoir between 144 m and 150 m, the total discharge has varied from around 

100 to 150 l/min, of which 20 l/min is water collected at the drainage gallery, in drains located 

in the bottom of the valley. Discharges of around 30 l/min are recorded on the right bank, 

while on the left bank discharges are approximately 10 l/min. Seeps are observed in the 

drainage gallery, with around 50 l/min in the bottom of the valley and approximately 20 l/min 

on the right bank. At the dam-wall gallery the total discharge is around 24 l/min. Maximum 

water pressures are of about 6 bar and maximum percentages of hydraulic head are of about 

75 %, and are recorded in piezometers which cross the grout curtain in an upstream direction.  

Although there are no evident problems, it was decided to study the foundation behaviour of 

Alqueva dam during this phase of reservoir filling, in particular in the area of the valley 

bottom where the highest discharges are recorded, close to the base of the right abutment.

4.3.2 Pedrógão dam 

4.3.2.1 General description of the dam 

Pedrógão dam (Figure 4.17 and Figure 4.18) is a straight gravity dam with a maximum height 

of 43 m and a total length of 448 m, of which 125 m are of conventional concrete and 323 m 

of RCC. The dam has an uncontrolled spillway with a length of 301 m with the crest at an 

elevation of 84.8 m. This spillway is divided into ten 28.75 m wide spans separated by nine 

pillars on which a pre-fabricated pathway was installed. The dam has a drainage gallery with 

the floor at elevations 54.0 m and 61.0 m. The crest of the spillway is at the retention water 

level. The maximum water level is 91.8 m (HIDRORUMO 2001). 

The construction of the dam began in April 2004, block concreting finished in October 2005 

and work was concluded in February 2006, with the first filling of the reservoir already under 

way.  In fact, the first filling of the reservoir of Pedrógão dam had begun four months earlier, 

on 28 October 2005. The water reached an elevation of 84.71 m, 9 cm below the spillway 

crest, on 4 April 2006. 

4.3.2.2 Geological-geotechnical conditions 

Before the construction of the dam, detailed geological and geotechnical investigation was 

carried out at the dam site which included a surface geological and geotechnical mapping, the 

opening of trenches and shafts, surface seismic and geoelectric prospecting, and the drilling of 

boreholes (HIDRORUMO 1999). A detailed logging of samples recovered by drilling was 

also carried out. In situ tests included water pressure permeability tests, dilatometer tests, and 

geophysical surveys. In laboratory the shear strength of discontinuities was determined and 

uniaxial compression and ultrasonic tests were carried out on rock samples (LNEC 1999d; 

LNEC 2004). 

The foundation consists of granite with small to medium-sized grains and is of good quality 

with the exception of the areas located near two faults in the main river channel and on the 

right bank, where the geomechanical properties in depth are weak (HIDRORUMO 2001). To 

take into account the existence of these two areas with weaker properties the depth of the 

excavations in blocks 7-8 and 8-9 was 9.0 m greater than in the adjacent blocks, and blocks 

are narrower between dam joints 4 and 5. To decrease stresses upon the foundation the bases 

of blocks 7-8 and 8-9 are wider than the base of the other blocks. According to both in situ 

and laboratory test results, the foundation Young’s modulus is greater than 4 GPa. Laboratory 

tests showed that the normal stiffness of discontinuities (kn) varies from 4.0 to 68.0 MPa/mm 

in the loading cycle and from 17.9 to 143 MPa/mm in the unloading cycle. The average shear 

stiffness, cohesion and friction angle are ks = 3.7 MPa/mm, c = 0.066 MPa, and ? = 35°, 

respectively (LNEC 2004).

Figure 4.18 – Downstream elevation and plan of Pedrógão dam. 

During excavation five sub-vertical and two sub-horizontal joint sets were identified (Neiva et 

al. 2004; Neves et al. 2000). More detailed analysis of data carried out afterwards made it 

possible to identify the main joint sets in the different foundation areas (EDP 2004). In the 

bottom of the valley these are: a) N50?E-100?E, 70?SSE-90?-70?NNW; b) N30?W-65?W, 

70?SW-90?-70?NE; c) N20?E-50?E, 70?NW-90?-75?SE; d) N15?W-20?E, 70?W-90?-65?E; 

g) N15?E-80?E, 15?-40?SE. Joint set a) is predominant, with a spacing between 

discontinuities from lower than 6 cm to 60 cm, trace lengths of 3 m to more than 20 m, 

slightly rough to rough, aperture lower than 5 mm and weathered to completely weathered 



   116 

(W3 to W5, according to ISRM terminology) (EDP 2004). Figure 4.19 shows the average 

position of the main sets of rock joints in relation to the dam. EDP (2004) drew attention to 

the fact that the sub-horizontal joints with dip angles lower than 10° may be relevant 

regarding strength and/or deformability of the dam foundation. In the bottom of the valley 

only a few sub-horizontal discontinuities were observed, but they were difficult to identify as 

the conclusions concerning joint discontinuities were drawn from studies in which mainly the 

2 horizontal dimensions were observed. The main faults and fracture alignments, which are 

also the main seepage paths, are aligned in the upstream-downstream direction, occurring 

mainly in the foundation of blocks 4-5, 7-8 and 8-9, which are the areas where the 

geomechanical properties in depth are weaker. The different types of granite are adjoined, at 

the surface, along lines in the upstream-downstream direction. Water pressure permeability 

tests carried out before the construction of the dam led to the conclusion that the foundations 

of blocks 1-2 and 9-10, close to the abutments, and 6-7 and 7-8, in the main river channel, 

were the areas of highest permeability, higher than 2 × 10
-7

 m/s (Figure 4.20). 

4.3.2.3 Foundation treatment 

Foundation treatment consisted only of a grout curtain along the alignment of the dam. Prior 

to this, a group of retaining boreholes was drilled upstream from the grout curtain, to avoid 

leakage of grout to the area further away from the dam whilst grouting the main curtain. There 

were several difficulties during grouting due to the fact that cement absorption per metre was 

very low. Lugeon type tests indicated that the initial high permeabilities recorded at the 

beginning of the grouting programme had not decreased even after grouting the quaternary 

holes, and therefore the curtain’s desired degree of permeability had not been reached 

(Tecnasol FGE 2007). The boreholes were drilled from the drainage gallery and their 

direction was defined taking into account the direction of the main discontinuities. The 

maximum depth of the grout curtain below concrete/rock mass interface is 49.0 m. No 

consolidation grouting was performed. A drainage curtain was drilled from the downstream 

area of the gallery. The drains are located 2.5 m apart and the average length of the holes in 

the rock mass is about 21 m, varying from 13 up to 31 m.  The majority of the boreholes were 

drilled with a dip direction of 140? and dipping 60? towards downstream.

4.3.2.4 Monitoring of foundation behaviour 

The monitoring system of Pedrógão dam includes the measurement of the main loads, namely 

the reservoir level, both the ambient and reservoir water temperature and the seismic loads, 

and of the following hydraulic and structural effects: water pressures, discharges, concrete 

temperature, displacements, joint movements, strains and stresses. A specific Monitoring Plan 

was developed for the follow-up of the actual behaviour during the first filling of the 

reservoir. 

In the dam foundation, displacements are measured with two inverted plumb lines and with 6 

vertical borehole (rod) extensometers and the hydraulic behaviour of the dam foundation is 

analysed measuring the discharges along the drainage system and the water pressures in a 

network of piezometers. 

The plumb lines were installed in blocks 8-9 and 4B-5. The rod extensometers were installed 

in the foundations of blocks 2-3, 4-5, 5-6, 7-8, 8-9 and 11-12, and each one has two rods, one 

fixed at a depth of 10 m below the concrete/rock mass interface, to evaluate rock mass 

deformations at shallow depths, and the other at a depth greater than 30 m, to evaluate rock 

mass deformations assuming that the lower point does not move. 

In 13 of the dam blocks a piezometer was installed immediately downstream from the 

drainage curtain dipping 50°, 60° or 70° towards downstream. A second piezometer, vertical 

and with two piezometric chambers, was installed in four of the blocks (4-5, 5-6, 6-7, and 

a

b

7-8), in the downstream area, underneath the stilling basin. These are vibrating-wire 

piezometers which allow readings to be taken in the drainage gallery, as they are located in a 

non-accessible area. The location and length of each chamber were defined taking into 

account the boreholes’ logs and the results of Lugeon type tests. Figure 4.21 shows two 

different cross sections of the dam. 

Due to the possible collapse of borehole walls, coarse sand or geodrains were placed inside 

several drains between dam joints 2 and 9, the majority of them at the base of blocks 6-7 and 

7-8.

4.3.2.5 Foundation hydraulic behaviour 

When the first filling of the reservoir began, with the water upstream from the dam at an 

elevation of 61.0 m, 7.0 m above the floor of the drainage gallery in its lower area, the total 

discharge was already 200 l/min. Since then Pedrógão dam has shown a peculiar seepage 

pattern, with some local high flow rates. Figure 4.22 shows the variations in the reservoir 

level since the beginning of its first filling until the end of April 2006, a week before borehole 

water-inflow tests were carried out. The same figure shows the total and partial recorded 

discharges plotted versus time. Three areas of the foundation are considered: the left bank 

includes blocks 9-10, 10-11, 11-12 and 12-13; the right bank includes blocks 2-3, 3-4 and 4-5; 

and the bottom of the valley includes the remaining blocks. 

In the first two months the total discharge reached values of about 650 l/min. The highest 

discharges were recorded in blocks 6B-7 and 7-7A. Due to the high discharges recorded, 

some drains were filled with coarse sand. To further reduce the discharges special devices 

which allow the regulation of uplift/discharge were installed in some of the drains. With these 

devices, named “piezodrains”, the total discharge can be reduced, at the same time reducing 

seepage velocity through the foundation and controlling the maximum values of the uplift. 

Thirty six of the 268 drains were changed into piezodrains. There are piezodrains at the base 

of all the blocks between dam joints 2 and 9, but they are most concentrated at the base of 

block 6-7 in which 15 out of 23 drains were working as piezometers or as piezodrains when 

tests were carried out. These devices were adjusted in the middle of January 2006 in such a 

way that the maximum values of the water pressures were lower than 50 % of the reservoir 

head, with the reservoir at 80.4 m. One month later they were adjusted once again and the 

total discharge was reduced to values not greater than 300 l/min. Since mid-February the 

reservoir level has ranged between 78.97 m and 84.71 m.  

Figure 4.23 shows the average values of the water pressures and of the percentage of 

hydraulic head along the base of the dam on 4 April 2006, with the reservoir at an elevation of 

84.71m. This figure shows that the highest discharges and percentages of hydraulic head were 

recorded at the base of blocks 6-6B and 6B-7. Figure 4.24 shows the variation in water 

pressures along the upstream-downstream direction, in the foundation of different dam blocks, 

recorded on 4 April 2006. 

A dam feature which may contribute to the high flow rates recorded is that the floor of the 

lower area of the drainage gallery is about 8.0 m below the water level downstream from the 

dam.

4.4 Tests carried out in Pedrógão dam foundation 

This section presents the tests carried out in two drainage boreholes in Pedrógão dam 

foundation in the week from 9-13 May 2006, with the reservoir at around 80.4 m. Tests were 

first carried out not only with the aim of testing the equipment, which had never been used, 

and evaluating the previously defined test procedures, but also because the high flow rates 

recorded in the foundation of this dam were more suitable for testing the equipment and the 

testing method and for comparing the test results against the results of a numerical model. 

Moreover, the team responsible for the safety assessment of the dam were also interested in 

knowing where water was coming from in some foundation areas. 

4.4.1 Preparation of tests 

4.4.1.1 Area where tests were carried out 

It was decided that tests should be carried out in the foundation of block 6-7, where the 

highest discharges were recorded. In this block, there were only three boreholes which could 

be tested: D12, D14 and D18. The remaining boreholes were either filled with coarse sand or 

with geodrains, which prevented the insertion of the equipment. Boreholes D12 and D18 were 

working as piezometers, and D14 as a drain. According to the design, boreholes were 26.0 m 

long (HIDRORUMO 2001). Figure 4.25 shows the location of both the drainage and 



   122 

piezometric boreholes in the foundation of block 6-7 and of block 7-8, close to dam vertical 

joint 7. 

4.4.1.2 Analysis of geological and geotechnical information 

The surface foundation map in the area of block 6-7 shows that the foundation was weathered 

at the surface with close to medium spaced rock joints (W3 and F3-F4, according to ISRM 

classification). When the surface foundation map was drawn, there were leakages at the base 

of this block, close to dam joint 6. More detailed information was obtained when the grout 

curtain boreholes were drilled. Logs show that the foundation is moderately to highly 

weathered, that the boreholes are crossed by close discontinuities (W3-W4 and F4-F5, 

according to ISRM classification) and that in several boreholes permeabilities higher than 

10 LU were obtained along the majority of the boreholes length, at between 7 to 42 m down 

from their head. In this block, rotary-percussive drilling was used to open drainage boreholes, 

which prevented the obtaining of samples. 

A cross section of the different geomechanical and hydraulic zones established in the 

foundation of block 6-7 (HIDRORUMO 2001) shows that the area tested was that with 

weaker geomechanical characteristics and higher permeability.  

4.4.1.3 Variation of discharges and water pressures 

Variations in discharges and water pressures recorded in drains and piezometers located in the 

foundation of block 6-7 are shown in Figure 4.26 and Figure 4.27. The first figure shows that 

in four of the drains (D2, D3, D5 and D6) discharges reached values higher than 60 l/min, 

before drains were changed into piezodrains. Variations in water pressures followed patterns 

of variations in reservoir level in the majority of piezometers, with a maximum of 1.8 bar. 

Higher water pressures were only recorded in piezometer PZ5J-1, located downstream, in the 

stilling basin, with the 2 m long piezometric chamber located between elevations 38.4 m and 

40.0 m.  

The available data showed that pressures gauges calibrated from 0 to 2.5 bar and from 0 to 4 

bar with reading intervals of 0.1 bar, and measuring cylinders of sizes between 0.125 and 20 l 

should be used. 

When borehole water-inflow tests were carried out, the maximum recorded discharge was 

around 10 l/min.

4.4.1.4 Stability analysis 

A two-dimensional stability analysis was carried out using the limit equilibrium method and 

taking into account the weight of the dam, the reservoir and tailwater loads, the uplift water 

pressures, and seismic loads. To assess safety against dam base sliding, usual and extreme 

loading combinations were used, prescribed in the Portuguese guidelines for dam design 

(RSB 2007). This study is presented in chapter 7. Although high flow rates and uplift 

pressures are recorded, the stability analysis carried out led to the conclusion that the base 

sliding stability of block 6-7 is ensured for usual load conditions. For extreme load conditions 

stability is not ensured if drains are inoperable.  

4.4.2 Summary of experimental activity 

Borehole water-inflow tests were carried out in drain D14 and in piezodrain D18, which was 

working as a piezometer. Due to time constraints tests were not carried out in drain D12 as 

had been planned. Just before tests were carried out, discharge in drain D14 was 11.5 l/min 

and water pressure in piezodrain D18 was 1.45 bar, which was about 50 % of the reservoir 

head. When this piezodrain was dismantled, in order to carry out tests, discharge was about 

60 l/min. Both boreholes were tested in consecutive sections throughout their lengths. Tests 

should have been carried out with the equipment assembled first as a single and then as a 

double packer. However, the supplier did not provide, before these first tests were carried out, 

the part which allows equipment to be assembled as a single packer. Therefore, a PVC stopper 

had to be made. This stopper could not take the water pressure, which meant that only a single 

test could be carried out with the single packer. 

4.4.3 Tests in drain D14 

Before testing began, readings were taken in order to know the reservoir level (80.44 m) and 

discharges and water pressures in all the drains, piezodrains and piezometers in the foundation 

of block 6-7. These discharges and water pressures were the “reference values”. The “blind 

device” was inserted into D14, which made it possible to remove obstructions at 3.75 m, 

5.20 m and 9.02 m down from the gallery floor and to measure the borehole length, which 

was not 26.0 m, as prescribed in the design, but 12.5 m, probably due to wall collapse after 

drilling. The equipment was assembled first as a single packer and, taking into account the 

borehole’s length, it was decided that four test intervals would be tested, between the bottom 

of the borehole and 11.0, 8.0, 5.0 and 2.0 m down from the drain head. In this way, there 

would be intervals 1.5, 4.5, 7.5 and 10.5 m long. Only the lowest test interval could be tested 

with the single packer. The rest of the borehole was tested with the double packer. 

 



   126 

Results are presented with the test divided into 10 steps, shown in Figure 4.28:  

Step 1: reference values (recorded before carrying out tests); 

Step 2: test at the lowest test interval (11.0 m – 12.5 m); 

Step 3: 8.0 m – 11.0 m test interval; 

Step 4: confirm that reference values had been reached; 

Step 5: 5.0 m – 8.0 m test interval; 

Step 6:  5.0 m – 8.0 m test interval, with the test interval closed; 

Step 7: confirm that reference values had been reached; 

Step 8: 2.0 m – 5.0 m test interval, with the test interval working as a drain; 

Step 9: 2.0 m – 5.0 m test interval, with the test interval closed; 

Step 10: confirm that reference values had been reached. 

Table 4.2 shows all the measurements taken while carrying out tests. Depths are measured 

along the borehole. Discharges are shown in blue for ease of analysis.  

Step 1 concerns reference values. In step 2, in which the lowest borehole area was tested, 

discharges in and above the test interval were measured over time for 25 minutes and it was 

concluded that discharge stabilization was immediate. In this step, the quantity of water 

flowing into the test interval was 8.68 l/min, which was around 75 % of the total discharge. 

The total discharge in the drain being tested was, at this test step, slightly lower than the 

reference discharge (11.16 l/min &amp;lt;11.5 l/min), probably due to the fact that the packer was 

obstructing a seepage path or to a change in water pressure distribution. At this step, there 

were only changes in drain D11, in which discharge decreased from 0.82 to 0.79 l/min and in 

piezometer D13, in which water pressure increased by 0.05 bar. Shortly after taking 

measurements, the PVC stopper which allowed the equipment to be assembled as a single 

packer failed and the equipment fell into the bottom of the borehole. Therefore, it was 

impossible both to close the pipes and to test the remaining test intervals with the single 

packer. 

In step 3, with the test interval from 8.0 m to 11.0 m down from the drain head, there was no 

water flowing out of the pipes, and the water level inside the pipes remained 27 cm above the 

gallery floor. The water pressure at the test interval was that of the water column weight. 

Taking the test interval’s mid-height as reference, the water pressure was:

Table 4.2 – Discharges and water pressures in the equipment placed in drain D14’s area of 

influence during the borehole water-inflow test. 

The quantity of water flowing in above the test interval was initially of 3.0 l/min but 

stabilized after around 5 minutes at 2.7 l/min. The change in neighbouring boreholes was 

almost instantaneous, and it was observed that the area of influence along the drainage line 

was 12.5 m long, from borehole D11 to D16. In this third step, D14’s drainage capacity 

decreased significantly. The water flowing into the lowest area of the tested borehole or along 

discontinuities that crossed the areas where packers’ rubbers met the borehole’s wall was 

prevented from flowing out, therefore that water found other seepage paths through the rock 



   128 

mass, increasing discharges and water pressures in all the equipment installed in its area of 

influence, particularly in borehole D13, in which the water pressure almost doubled. An 

increase in the quantity of water flowing in above the test interval was also observed at values 

greater than in the second step.  

In step 4 the packer was deflated and new measurements were taken. Discharge in the drain 

being tested increased by about 0.6 l/min, which can be explained by the clearing of seepage 

paths due to the closure of the lowest test interval. With the exception of the water pressure 

recorded in borehole D12, all the equipment showed a slight difference in relation to reference 

values: in boreholes D11, D12, D13 and PZ5 M, on the right hand side of the borehole when 

looking from upstream, discharges and water pressures were slightly lower, and on the left 

hand side discharges in drains D15 and D16 were a little higher. 

In step 5 the quantity of water flowing into the test interval was 9.40 l/min and above the 

packers was 0.65 l/min. The only significant change was in D15’s discharge, which increased 

by around 33 %, from 4.73 to 6.29 l/min, due to the closure of borehole D14’s lowest area, 

into which a large quantity of water flowed. In the previous step, prior to the isolation of the 

5.0 - 8.0 m test interval, the total discharge was 12.1 l/min. In step 2 about 8.7 l/min flowed 

into the borehole in the 11.0 – 12.5 m interval. A discharge of 9.40 l/min in the 5.0 – 8.0 m 

test interval is higher than the total discharge minus the quantity of water flowing into the 

lowest part of the borehole, therefore seepage paths changed. In a rock mass there are always 

intersections between discontinuities and therefore one way of explaining this step test’s 

results is that when the borehole branch from 11.0 -12.5 m is working as a drain the easiest 

flow path is through that branch, i.e. that is the path with the lowest loss of hydraulic head. 

However, the favoured seepage paths when this branch is closed are those which lead to the 

area located 5.0 - 8.0 m down from the drain head. 

In step 6 the 5.0 – 8.0 m test interval was closed and the water pressure at the pipes’ head 

stabilized at 0.65 bar after 10 minutes. In the mid-way in the branch being tested the water 

pressure was 1.045 bar. Discharge flowing in above the packer practically doubled (from 0.65 

to 1.29 l/min) and discharges and water pressures increased in all the equipment located in the 

borehole’s area of influence. The most significant increase was in the adjacent drain, D15, in 

which discharge which had already increased from 4.73 to 6.29 l/min when the test interval 

was isolated increased to 10.1 l/min when the pipes were closed. The water pressure of 1.0 bar 

recorded in borehole D13 would be incoherent if discharge in drain D15 had not increased so 

significantly. If discharges in neighbouring boreholes had not increased, the water pressure at 

D13 would be equal or greater than that recorded in step 3 (1.25 bar). 

After deflating the packers, in step 7, measurements were almost the same as those recorded 

in step 4. In the following step (step 8), with the 2.0 – 5.0 m interval, only 1.93 l/min flowed 



 129 

into the test interval and discharges and water pressures in all the neighbouring boreholes 

increased. Once again, the most significant discharge increase was in drain D15, from 4.55 to 

10.1 l/min. When the pipes were closed, in step 9, the water pressure reached steady state 

conditions in only 45 seconds and was around 0.545 bar at mid-way in the test interval. Only 

a slight increase in discharges and water pressures was recorded in boreholes located in the 

vicinity, and the quantity of water flowing in above the packer increased almost four times. In 

the last test step recorded values were close to those recorded in steps 4 and 7. It would have 

been interesting to withdraw the borehole from the drainage system, by closing it, and to 

measure the water pressure at its head so as to asses its influence in the surrounding area. This 

influence, however, is almost shown in step 9. 

Figure 4.29 shows some photos taken whilst carrying out tests. 

Figure 4.30 and Figure 4.31 show recorded discharges and water pressures in the equipment 

in drain’s D14’s area of influence during the tests. It can be seen that the total discharge 

decreases significantly in step 3, when the lowest part of the borehole is closed. In step 5, the 

isolation of the 5.0 – 8.0 m test interval has almost no influence on the total discharge because 

water flows into this area. In steps 6, 8 and 9, the decrease is lower than in step 3, due to the 

increase in the quantity of water flowing into drain D15. Discharges in drains D11 and D16 

barely change during tests. Whenever the total discharge in D14’s area of influence decreases, 

the water pressures in piezometers located in this area increase proportionally. 

Figure 4.32 shows the flow of water entering each water-inflow test interval and the 

accumulated discharge from the bottom to the borehole head. The drain’s recorded discharge 

in normal operating conditions is shown in both graphs: in the first it allows the assessment of 

discharges in each test interval in relation to the drain’s total discharge; in the second it allows 

the comparison between accumulated and total discharge. It is clear that the quantity of water 

that flows into the lowest borehole area also flows into the 5.0 – 8.0 m test interval and thus in 

Figure 4.32 b) discharge flowing into the lower section of the borehole is included twice. In 

the same figure it is shown that if this fact is taken into account, by subtracting the quantity of 

water that flows into the drain’s lower section, the accumulated discharge at the drain’s head 

is almost the same as the reference discharge. When comparing discharges it has to be taken 

into account that the pipes’ head varies in the different test steps. In order to accurately 

compare discharges, pipes’ head should be at the same level in every test step. In practice, this 

would mean that pipes would have to be cut, which is not feasible. 

Figure 4.33 a) shows the volume of water entering the borehole section above the packer. The 

same figure shows the discharge above the test interval when it is closed. Figure 4.33 b) 

shows the variation of water pressure along the borehole. The highest water pressure is 

recorded at the 5.0 – 8.0 m test interval and is 1.05 bar.  



   130 

From tests in drain D14 it is concluded that: i) 75 % of drain discharge flows into the drain in 

its lowest 1.5 m; ii) the area of influence along the drainage line is around 12.5 m; iii) there 

are links through rock mass discontinuities, between the test interval from 5.0 m to 8.0 m and 

the area below; iv) the highest water pressure, of around 1.05 bar, is measured in the 

5.0 - 8.0 m test interval. It can also be concluded that this drain is relevant regarding water 

pressure relief in the foundation of block 6-7 as the exclusion of any borehole branch leads to 

an increase in water pressures and discharges in boreholes located in its area of influence.

4.4.4 Tests in drain D18 

As with tests in drain D14, the reservoir level (80.36 m) was measured before testing began. 

Borehole D18 was working as a piezometer and therefore, to carry out tests, it was necessary 

to dismantle it. In order to check its area of influence, discharges and water pressures were 

recorded in all the drains, piezodrains and piezometers in the foundation of block 6-7 and in 

part of the foundation of block 7-8, close to joint 7, before and after dismantling the 

piezometer. Measurements lead to the conclusion that discharges and water pressures 

decreased in all the equipment located from piezometer PZ5M, in the foundation of block 6-7, 

to borehole D3, in the foundation of block 7-8 (Figure 4.25). Therefore, the borehole’s area of 

influence is around 30 m along the drainage line. Readings taken with the borehole working 

as a drain are the “reference values”. Reference discharge in borehole D18 is 61.35 l/min. 

The “blind device” was inserted into D18. There was an obstruction at 10.5 m, which was 

easily removed. It was found that from 13.5 to 15 m down from the gallery floor the borehole 

walls were very irregular, indicating a very fractured area. The borehole length was 25.5 m. 

The decision was made to start testing with the 20.0 – 23.0 m test interval. The lowest 1.5 m 

long borehole area was not tested, as it was not possible to assemble the equipment as a single 

packer. All the measurements taken while carrying out tests are shown in Appendix 1. 

In addition to test step 0, which are readings taken before dismantling the piezometer, 13 step 

tests were considered, shown in Figure 4.34: 

Step 1: reference values (recorded before carrying out tests, with D18 working as a drain); 

Step 2: 20.0 m – 23.0 m test interval; 

Step 3: 17.0 m – 20.0 m test interval; 

Step 4: 14.0 m – 17.0 m test interval; 

Step 5: 11.0 m – 14.0 m test interval; 

Step 6: 8.0 m – 11.0 m test interval; 

Step 7: 8.0 m – 11.0 m test interval, with the test interval closed; 

Step 8: 8.0 m – 11.0 m test interval, with both the test interval and piezodrain D19 closed; 

Step 9: 8.0 m – 11.0 m test interval, after re-adjusting piezodrain D19 to its previous 

position and with the test interval working as a drain; 

Step 10: 5.0 m – 8.0 m test interval; 

Step 11: 5.0 m – 8.0 m test interval, with the test interval closed. 

Step 12: confirm that reference values had been reached; 

Step 13: 2.0 m – 5.0 m test interval.

Figure 4.34 – Test steps in borehole D18. 

Test results concerning discharges and water pressures in each test interval are shown in 

Figure 4.35 and Figure 4.36. The following paragraphs describe the various steps in detail. 

In the first 5 test steps, water flowing into the areas being tested did not reach the pipes’ head, 

there were only slight changes in the quantity of water flowing in above the test interval and 

apparently there were no changes in discharges and water pressures in the neighbouring 

equipment. The water pressure in each test interval was calculated taking into account the 

length of the water column inside the pipes. In step 2, piezodrain D19, adjacent to the 

borehole being tested, was closed and no change in borehole D18’s discharge was recorded. 

Piezodrain D19 was re-adjusted to its previous position and it was decided that during tests it 

should only be closed if there were water flowing out of the pipes. In steps 2 to 5 readings 

were only taken in drain D18 because it was thought that as there had been no changes in 

readings in the borehole being tested, there would be no changes in the neighbouring 

boreholes.  

In step 6, when the 8.0 – 11.0 m test interval was closed, there was a sudden change in test 

results: the total discharge in borehole D18 decreased from 55.0 l/min to 38.9 l/min, and the 

most significant part of this discharge (around 95 %) flowed into the test interval being tested. 

This decrease in drain discharge was probably due to the obstruction of one or more 

discontinuities through which water flowed, as an increase in discharges and water pressures 

was recorded in almost all the neighbouring equipment. When the pipes were closed (step 7), 

the water pressure at the pressure gauge increased quickly and reached steady-state conditions 

in only 7 minutes. Discharges and water pressures increased slightly in equipment located in 

D18’s area of influence. In the following step (step 8), piezodrain D19 was also closed. 

Discharge flowing into borehole D18 at above the test interval increased, as did the water 

pressure at the test interval and at the piezodrains located in the neighbouring area. Due to 

time constraints, discharges were only measured at drain D18.

   136 

In step 9, water was allowed to flow out of the pipes and a new attempt was made to re-adjust 

piezodrain D19 to its previous position. However, this was extremely difficult and, due to the 

disturbance that any change in adjacent equipment causes, the decision was made not to 

change anything in neighbouring equipment during borehole water-inflow tests. Discharges in 

the drain being tested were almost the same as those recorded in step 8 and therefore it was 

thought that the piezodrain was well positioned. No readings were taken in the neighbouring 

equipment. The packer was raised 3.0 m and discharges and water pressures in the equipment 

located in borehole D18’s area of influence were taken with the test interval working as a 

drain and with the pipes closed (step 10). The comparison between readings in steps 6 and 10 

showed that there was a significant increase in D19’s discharge and a decrease in water 

pressures. At the same time, discharges recorded in D18 were lower than those recorded in 

step 6. This could either be due to the clearing of discontinuities, as a result of an increase in 

seepage velocity, or to the improper re-adjustment of piezodrain D19. Results analysis carried 

out afterwards showed that piezodrain D19 had not been properly re-adjusted.  

Tests carried out in drain D18 lead to the following conclusions: 

i) water flowed into the drain at between 5.0 and 11.0 m down from the drain head; 

ii) the area of influence along the drainage line was around 30 m; 

iii) there was water inflow of around 16.0 l/min at between 7.5 and 8.0 m down from 

the drain head; 

iv) the test intervals 5.0 – 8.0 m and 8.0-11.0 m were linked through conductive 

discontinuities around the borehole; 

Figure 4.35 clearly shows that both test intervals from 5.0 – 8.0 m and 8.0 - 11.0 m were 

linked through conductive discontinuities, as the accumulated discharge from the bottom to 

the borehole head was greater than the reference discharge. As the two test intervals were 

linked, the water pressure should have been the same in both. The slight difference between 

recorded water pressures, of 0.025 bar, was probably a measurement error. 

Test results show that borehole D18 is highly efficient at lowering water pressures in the 

neighbouring area. However, this decrease in water pressures is achieved with an excessive 

increase in discharges in its area of influence, from around 87 l/min to 137 l/min. 

 

 



 137 

4.4.5 Main difficulties found whilst carrying out tests 

The double packer used was acquired about a year before these “experimental” tests were 

carried out and it was necessary to buy and develop a serious of parts without which the tests 

would not have been possible. Despite the great care taken to check the equipment before 

tests, some difficulties were still found whilst testing in situ. Firstly, the piece of equipment 

provided by the supplier to hold the steel cable did not fit inside the pipe at the borehole’s 

head. Therefore, it was necessary to modify it and replace the provided steel cable with 

another of lower diameter. Secondly, the supplier did not provide, before these first tests were 

carried out, the part which allows equipment to be assembled as a single packer. Therefore, a 

PVC stopper had to be made. However, it could not take the water pressure, which meant that 

only a single test could be carried out. Finally, the recording device for the pressure 

transducer was not working properly, therefore water pressures could not be taken directly 

and had to be taken at the boreholes’ head, with pressure gauges. Regarding this latter 

difficulty, it should be stressed that the recording device is linked to the pressure transducer 

and it was impossible to check this in the laboratory, as a borehole with water under pressure 

where the packer could be inflated would be required. 

4.4.6 Conclusions drawn from tests carried out in Pedrógão dam foundation 

Tests carried out in only two boreholes do not give enough information about seepage in a 

foundation area. However, in this case they made it possible to identify both the depth at 

which the main seepage paths cross the boreholes and links between neighbouring boreholes. 

The following conclusions could be drawn: 

i) the main seepage paths cross the drains at between 5.0 m and 11.0 m down from 

the drain head; 

ii) steady state seepage is reached relatively quickly, due to the high permeability of 

the rock mass under blocks 6B-7 and 7-7A. 

iii) the high seepage velocity recorded in the boreholes reveals that the grout curtain 

is probably inefficient in this area. 

iv) both tested boreholes are relevant regarding water pressure relief in the foundation 

of block 6-7, but in borehole D18 this decrease in water pressures is achieved with 

an excessive increase in discharges in its area of influence  

These conclusions are consistent with the results of water pressure permeability tests carried 

out both before the construction of the dam and when the grout curtain boreholes were drilled. 

The absence of drainage boreholes logs does not allow further analysis.  



   138 

4.5 Tests carried out in Alqueva dam foundation 

4.5.1 Preparation of tests 

4.5.1.1 Area where tests were carried out and variation of discharges and water pressures 

The decision was made to carry out tests, in block 17-18, where the highest discharges were 

recorded in the valley bottom. Figure 4.37 shows recorded discharges and water pressures in 

this block’s foundation. Discharges are very low, with the exception of drain D25 D in which 

discharges went up to 3.0 l/min. When the water in the reservoir rose from around 120 to 

136 m in only 3 months, one or more discontinuities which cross drain D25 D opened, and 

there was a sudden increase in the drain discharge, from 0.2 to 0.9 l/min. This increase was 

even higher when the reservoir level increased from 136 to 148 m. In this case, discharge 

increased almost 4 times. 

Tests were to be carried out in drain D25 D, PZB 13-2 and PZB 13-3, in order to obtain 

information along the upstream-downstream direction. Analysis of discharges recorded in the 

neighbouring blocks showed that it would also be interesting to carry out tests in drain D26 D, 

located in block 18-19, and D20 D, in block 16-17. Figure 4.38 shows the location of drains 

and piezometric boreholes in blocks 16-17, 17-18 and 18-19.

Figure 4.38 – Location of drains and piezometric boreholes in the foundation of blocks 16-17, 

17-18 and 18-19. 

4.5.1.2 Analysis of geological and geotechnical information 

The surface foundation map shows that the foundation of blocks 16-17, 17-18 and 18-19 was 

fresh to slightly weathered at surface with wide to medium spaced rock joints (W1-W2 and 

F2-F3, according to ISRM classification). 

Available drainage borehole logs show that, in this area, the foundation was fresh to slightly 

weathered, with moderate to close rock joints (W1-2 and F3-4, according to ISRM 

terminology), crossed by numerous thin layers and veins of quartz and carbonates and, in 

block 16-17, by discontinuities at different depths, some of them filled with cement grout. 

The rock mass was almost impervious, with permeabilities of around 0.1 LU. 

Lugeon type tests were carried out with the reservoir empty but with the structure’s weight 

acting on the foundation. The reservoir filling causes the dam to rotate towards downstream, 

with the consequent opening of sub-vertical discontinuities upstream from the dam and 

increase in the aperture of the sub-horizontal discontinuities located below the heel of the 

dam. As a consequence, the foundation permeability in the area upstream from the dam 

increases.

4.5.2 Summary of experimental activity 

Borehole water-inflow tests in six drain and piezometric boreholes were carried out in three 

different weeks with the reservoir at various elevations: the first tests were done from 16-20 

October 2006, with the water level around 143.6 m; the second from 19-23 March 2007, with 

the water level around 150.0 m; and the third from 3-7 September 2007, with the water at an 

elevation of about 148.0 m. Both the electrical conductivity of water and temperature were 

measured every 0.5 m along the tested boreholes prior to water-inflow testing, using a 

portable conductivity meter with automatic temperature compensation. 

In the first week, tests were conducted in drain D25 D and in piezometer PZB13-2. In order to 

obtain information about seepage in the upstream-downstream direction, an attempt was made 

to do borehole water-inflow tests in piezometer PZB13-3, installed at the downstream 

drainage gallery, where an uplift water pressure of 0.5 bar was recorded, which was 6.1 % of 

the hydraulic head. However, the low discharge drained by the borehole (0.02 l/min) would 

make borehole water-inflow tests useless. 

New tests were carried out in March 2007, with the reservoir at an elevation 6.4 m higher than 

when the first tests were performed. The main aim of these new tests was to study seepage in 

the base of blocks 17-18 and 18-19 in more detail and to detect possible seepage changes due 

to the raising of the water level in the reservoir. In order to detect these changes, tests should 

have been repeated in drain D25 D. However, the monitoring data led to the conclusion that 

between the tests carried out in October 2006 and March 2007, the discharge in drain D25 D 

and the water pressure recorded with the drain closed were only about 8 % higher (from 

2.0 l/min up to 2.18 l/min and from 4.825 bar up to 5.25 bar), thus it was decided not to repeat 

the tests in that drain. In the week before this second group of tests was done, drains D25 D, 

D26 D and D27 D, located in the area being studied, were successively closed, recording 

discharges and water pressures before and after closing the drains, in steady state conditions, 

in an area assumed to be larger than the boreholes’ area of influence. Tests were conducted in 

boreholes D26 D and D27 D, in block 18-19, and D20 D, in block 16-17. Due to time 

constraints, readings during testing in drain D20 D were taken in transient conditions. In order 

to obtain more accurate results, new borehole water-inflow tests were carried out in this drain 

in September 2007.  

Additional information to that provided from the borehole water-inflow tests was obtained by 

gradually closing drainage boreholes and doing water electrical conductivity and temperature 

analyses: 

- On 21 March 2007, during the second round of water-inflow tests, the electrical 

conductivity of water was measured along the two boreholes of the GDJD floor 



 141 

where the highest discharges are recorded and in the following week, from 26-29 

March both drains were closed, in turn, with a pressure gauge at their heads. These 

tests aimed to obtaining an indication of the seepage pattern downstream from the 

grout and drainage curtains. 

-  From 21-25 May 2007, with the reservoir at around 149.30 m, water electrical 

conductivity and temperature analysis tests were done in the majority of the 

drainage boreholes located in the bottom of the valley and in blocks 18-19 and 

19-20, on the right bank, in order to obtain information about where each one of 

the boreholes was crossed by seepage paths. From 20-21 November 2007, with the 

reservoir at 147.56 m, new tests were carried out in some boreholes. 

- From 5-8 May 2008, with the reservoir at around 148.0 m, all the drains located in 

block 17-18 were gradually closed, so as to identify seepage links between 

boreholes, to assess the way in which water pressures varied in the foundation of 

the dam block, and to obtain the average water pressure in the block foundation. 

Some information about tested boreholes is given in Table 3.1: borehole reference, block 

where it is installed, length, type of test, date when tests were carried out, water level in the 

reservoir at the time of each test, water pressure at the borehole head when the hole is closed 

and corresponding percentage of hydraulic head.  

As tests in Pedrógão dam foundation have been presented in great detail in the previous 

sections, covering different situations, the following sections include a much simpler 

description of the similar tests done in Alqueva dam foundation followed by presentation and 

discussion of the results. The situations which are referred to and analysed are those which 

stood out as being unusual or different. Measurements taken during testing and both water 

electrical conductivity and temperature profiles are shown in Appendix 1. 

4.5.3 Tests in drain D25 D 

In the electrical conductivity and temperature profiles along drain D25 D obtained prior to 

water-inflow testing (Figure 4.39) there is a sudden variation in the electrical conductivity at 

between 6.0 and 8.5 m down from the drain head and in temperature at between 6.5 and 

8.0 m, therefore it was concluded that this was probably the area where water was flowing 

into the borehole. Flow rates and water pressures in each drain and piezometric boreholes 

installed at the base of blocks 16-17, 17-18 and 18-19 were first recorded. After the readings, 

drain D25 D was closed with a pressure gauge at its head, which allowed the measurement of 

the hydraulic water pressure being released by the drain and the assessment of the drain’s 

length of influence along the drainage line (18 m) comparing discharges and water pressures 



   142 

measured in the nearby boreholes before and after closing the drain, in steady state conditions. 

The later opening of the drain and the measurement, over time, of the discharges and water 

pressures in the boreholes placed in the drain’s area of influence provided information about 

the period of time necessary to reach steady state conditions (around 90 minutes).

Tests were carried out from the borehole bottom upwards, first with a single and then with a 

double packer. The latter was only used in test intervals where water was coming in. Figure 

4.40 shows the water pressure variation after closing different test intervals. The time 

necessary to reach a constant pressure varied from around 40 to 90 minutes.

   144 

Analysis of discharge and water pressure variations in the equipment placed in drain D25 D’s 

area of influence led to the following main conclusions: i) the discharge in most of the drains 

located less than 6.0 m away from D25 D increased when either the drain or the test intervals 

were closed; this discharge increase was more significant in drain D26 D, adjacent to the 

drain being tested; ii) the closure of drain D25 D had no influence on the discharges recorded 

in drains D24 D and D28 D; iii) after closing drain D25 D, the total discharge coming into the 

drain increased; iv) the sum of the discharges in the borehole’s area of influence varied 

slightly during the test; however, a significant decrease was noticed when drain D25 D was 

closed and when test intervals from 4.0 m to the bottom of the borehole and from 4.0 – 7.0 m 

were closed; v) in the four piezometers located in the drain’s area of influence, including that 

located in the downstream drainage gallery, water pressure increased when the drain was 

totally or partially closed, PZB13-1 being the most sensitive to test interval closure. 

Analysis of discharges and water pressures in each test interval compared with the reference 

discharge showed that the water flowing out of the drain head entered the borehole at between 

1.0 and 10.0 m down from the drain head, and that 90 % of the water entered the borehole at 

between 4.0 m and 7.0 m down from the drain head. It was also concluded that there were no 

seepage paths between the three 3.0 m long test intervals into each water flowed. Results of 

water conductivity analysis along the borehole, which led to the conclusion that water flowed 

into the borehole at between 6.0 m and 8.5 m down from the drain head, are consistent with 

the results of water-inflow tests. 

The water pressure at the various test intervals obtained with both the single and double 

packer was compared with the water pressure when the drain was closed and it was concluded 

that, in this case, the highest water pressure, recorded when the 4.0 – 7.0 m test interval was 

closed, extended along the entire length of the borehole. In the single packer test, with the test 

interval at between 4.0 m and the bottom of the borehole, the water pressure was around 

3.4 bar, lower than that recorded when the double packer was used at the test interval 

4.0-7.0 m. It has been concluded that in both tests the equipment was not in exactly the same 

position and that in the single packer test a seepage path was plugged by the packer. 

At the end of the week in which these first tests were carried out, drain D25 D was closed 

again and a water pressure of 4.45 bar was achieved, which was 54 % of the hydraulic head. 

From the beginning to the end of the week, the water pressure and corresponding percentage 

of hydraulic head decreased in drain D25 D and increased in piezometers PZB 12 and 

PZB 14-2. Differences in the recorded pressures were probably due to changes in seepage 

conditions induced by closing consecutive sections along drain D25 D. 

Rotary-percussive drilling was used to open drain D25 D and therefore no borehole log is 

available to analyse in conjunction with water-inflow tests results. 



 145 

4.5.4 Tests in piezometer PZB 13-2 

In piezometer PZB 13-2, after obtaining “reference values”, the purge valve was opened and 

closed which showed that water pressure was recovered in only about 5 minutes. The pressure 

gauge was then removed from the top of the borehole and it was kept working as a drain. The 

comparison of discharges and water pressures observed before and after removing the 

pressure gauge led to the conclusion that the borehole’s length of influence along the drainage 

line was about 27 m, and that piezometer PZB 13-3, located in the downstream drainage 

gallery was also in the borehole’s area of influence. It was curious to observe that the removal 

of the pressure gauge had no influence on the recorded discharges, except in drain D22 D, 

adjacent to the borehole being tested, in which a slight discharge reduction was observed. 

The test was carried out with the single packer in successive ascending test intervals, raising 

the packer 3 m each time. It was observed that around 64 % of the reference discharge flowed 

into the 19.0 m – bottom of the borehole interval. The water pressure recorded when this test 

interval was closed was 2.5 times greater than the reference pressure. While testing the next 

interval, from 16.0 m to the bottom of the borehole, no water was flowing into the test interval 

and it was observed that the water which was entering was flowing into the borehole from 

above the packer. It was concluded that the test interval from 16.0 m to 19.0 m was connected 

with the area above 16.0 m, by seepage paths in the surrounding rock mass. To find out the 

elevation at which the connection took place, the remaining test intervals were successively 

isolated. In all these test steps the water was flowing into the borehole from above the packer. 

While examining the test results, it was observed that one of the vertical boreholes where 

geophysical tests had been carried out was drilled only about 0.5 m away from the borehole 

being tested. It was concluded that there were seepage paths linking both boreholes, not only 

in the 16.0 m - 19.0 m test interval but also in depths not greater than 0.75 m, probably in the 

block/pavement concrete interface.  

In this case, the existence of seepage paths linking the piezometric borehole and the borehole 

drilled to perform geophysical tests, which allows water leaks, releases water pressures; 

therefore, contrary to what is observed in D25 D’s test, the maximum water pressure is not 

recorded at the borehole’s head. 

It may be concluded that PZB 13-2 is a useless borehole due to the fact that, regarding the 

safety evaluation of the dam, the information provided by this piezometer is misleading. 

4.5.5 Tests in drain D26 D 

Tests in drain D26 D were carried out straightforwardly in only 7 steps using the single 

packer and raising the equipment 1.0 m each time. As the water electrical conductivity and 



   146 

temperature profiles had shown that water probably entered the borehole at between 3.5 and 

5.0 m down from the drain head, the packer was first placed at the depth of 7.0 m, which 

significantly decreased the time spent doing the test. It was concluded that the borehole’s 

length of influence along the drainage line was about 30 m and that the total discharge flowed 

into the borehole at between 4.0 and 5.0 m down from the drain head. 

4.5.6 Tests in drain D27 D 

In this drain, the results of water electrical and temperature analysis were not conclusive and 

therefore the borehole was tested along its whole length. Tests led to the conclusion that the 

water flowing from the drain head entered the borehole at between 1.0 and 7.0 m down from 

the drain head, equally distributed between the two 3.0 m long test intervals (4.0 – 7.0 m and 

1.0 – 4.0 m). Whenever the test interval was closed, a water-spout from the gallery floor was 

observed, which shows that water pressures in the borehole being tested were being relieved, 

and that this is therefore an effective drain. 

4.5.7 Tests in drain D20 D 

The first tests carried out in drain D20 D, in March 2007, were limited by time constraints 

which meant that readings were taken in transient conditions. Despite this, the tests showed 

that the drain’s length of influence along the drainage line was about 27 m and, as with drain 

D25 D and piezometer PZB 13-2, its area of influence extended towards downstream, at least 

as far as piezometer PZB 13-3. It was possible to conclude that water flowed into the borehole 

at between 4.0 m and 10.0 m down from the drain head and that about half of the quantity of 

water flowed into the borehole at between 4.0 m and 7.0 m. Differences in discharges 

recorded when the single and the double packers were used were probably due to the 

equipment not being at exactly the same position. 

New borehole water-inflow tests were carried out in September 2007, which were carefully 

conducted allowing the time necessary to reach steady state conditions. Great care was also 

taken with the positioning of the packers inside the borehole. In order to obtain more detailed 

results, a test interval of only 1 m was used. As the first tests had led to the conclusion that the 

water first entered the borehole at between 7.0 m and 10.0 m down from the drain head, the 

single packer was first placed at a depth of 10.0 m, and it was observed, as expected, that 

there was no water flowing into the test interval. This was also observed in the following test 

interval, when the packer was raised by 1 m. 

 

 



 147 

Tests carried out led to the following conclusions:  

i) water first entered the borehole at between 8.0 m and 9.0 m down from the drain 

head and there was no change in readings taken in adjacent drains when this test 

interval was closed;  

ii) the second place where water entered the borehole was at between 5.0 m and 6.0 m 

down from the drain head, and the third at between 4.0 m and 5.0 m; these seepage 

paths were linked, but only the discontinuity located at between 4.0 m and 5.0 m 

down from the drain head influenced readings on the downstream piezometer. 

iii) tests in drain D20 D only induced changes in readings in the adjacent drains 

(D19 D and D21 D), in piezometer PZB 14-1, and in piezometer PZB 13-3, 

located in the downstream drainage gallery. 

At the end of the tests, as it was observed that discontinuities located at between 4.0 m and 

6.0 m down from the drain head were linked, it was decided to isolate a test interval which 

included all these discontinuities. With the equipment available it was not possible to isolate a 

test interval of 2.0 m, therefore, keeping in mind that there was no water flowing into the 

borehole at between 6.0 m and 7.0 m down from the drain head, an interval of 3.0 m was 

considered, from 4.0 m to 7.0 m. 

4.5.8 Additional tests 

4.5.8.1 Water electrical conductivity analyses 

In May 2007, with the reservoir at around 149.3 m, water electrical conductivity and 

temperature analysis tests were carried out in the majority of the drainage boreholes located in 

the bottom of the valley and in the first two blocks at the base of the slope, on the right bank.  

Analysis along the boreholes was carried out with readings every 0.5 m. The electrical 

conductivity and temperature profiles are shown in Appendix 1. From the simultaneous 

analysis of both graphs it was possible to identify the depth at which seepage paths cross the 

drains, as this occurs at the depths in which there is a sudden variation in either one or both 

parameters. In some cases, however, changes in the electrical conductivity profile can be due 

to changes in rock mass lithology, and therefore the profiles should be analysed alongside 

each borehole log. In most of the electrical conductivity profiles results obtained close to the 

drain bottom are not shown, as, due to the presence of sediments, they are much lower than 

the data obtained at lower depths. The depth at which the concrete/rock mass interface occurs 

is shown in gray or green in each graph presented in Appendix 1 (section A1.5), with the 



   148 

exception of those regarding boreholes where rotary-percussive drilling was used because no 

information is available about the section of the borehole which goes through concrete. 

During tests it was observed that in the area of the valley bottom close to the left bank there 

are a great number of completely or partially clogged boreholes. Analysis of the matter which 

obstructs the boreholes showed that it consists mainly of calcite, which almost certainly 

comes from the cement grout, which was placed in greater quantities in the left bank. The 

slow seepage velocities increase the time period for which the water is close to cement and 

the right conditions for precipitation are probably found when the water reaches the borehole. 

Figure 4.41 shows water electrical conductivity analysis being carried out and the head of one 

of the clogged boreholes.  

Figure 4.42 shows where water flows into each borehole in the area tested, detected by both 

water-inflow tests and water electrical conductivity analysis. The accuracy of the latter tests 

can be verified, as in the boreholes where both tests were carried out inflows of water in the 

same areas were identified. Tests led to the conclusion that water flows into the majority of 

the boreholes mostly at shallow depths, in an area close to the concrete/rock mass interface. 

Most of the detected inflows of water below the boreholes’ mid-depth are apparently in areas 

where the boreholes are crossed by faults. These could be due to a vein of different matter 

crossing the borehole. Some of the holes in which this occurs were drilled using rotary-

percussive methods and therefore no log is available, and even from those available, no 

further information could be obtained. Figure 4.42 also shows that the bottom of almost every 

borehole is obstructed, due to the presence of sediment.

4.5.8.2 Tests in drains located in the floor of the downstream drainage gallery branch 

excavated in the rock mass (GDJD) 

The downstream drainage gallery has a branch which extends towards the right bank and is 

excavated into the rock mass. In this area, called GDJD, the gallery has a concrete covering 

and is drained with fans of boreholes drilled in the floor, the sidewalls and gallery ceiling, in 

sections located 2.5 m apart. A pipe was installed at the heads of the drains which collect the 

greater quantity of water, to allow measurement of discharges and to conduct the water into 

gutter pipes (Figure 4.43). 

According to the geological-geotechnical surface foundation map (EDP 2006) the whole 

gallery was excavated in green schist of good geotechnical quality: the rock mass is fresh to 

slightly weathered (W1 to W2) and the mean distance between successive rock joints 

measured along an intersecting straight line varies between moderate to close (F3 to F4) and 

wide to moderate (F2 to F3). The rock mass crossed by this gallery shows some thin faults (in 

the order of 2 to 10 cm) and some faults, mainly at the top of the gallery area, where some 

leakages were observed (Figure 4.44). 

In order to have an indication of the rock mass seepage pattern downstream from the grout 

and drainage curtains, the electrical conductivity of water was measured along the two 

boreholes of GDJD floor where the highest discharges were recorded, whose approximate 

location is shown in Figure 4.44: i) drain DGDJM–5D, with a discharge of 0.41 l/min, and 

ii) drain DGDJI-2D, with a discharge 0.05 l/min. Both drains are located around 14.0 m 

downstream from the drainage curtain. Test results are shown in Appendix 1. 

 

 

Figure 4.43 – Top of the extension of the downstream drainage gallery towards the right bank. 



 151 

The first drain tested, dipping towards upstream, is only 2.75 m long and, according to test 

results, water flows into the borehole at its bottom or about 1.0 m down from the floor 

elevation. The second drain tested is vertical, 4.75 m long, and located halfway between 

gallery sidewalls. Water probably enters this drain at a depth of 2.3 m. The diameter of these 

boreholes is 55 mm, therefore it was not possible to carry out borehole water-inflow tests with 

the available equipment.

In the following week both drains were closed, in turn, with a pressure gauge at their heads. 

Water pressures of 0.15 bar and 0.275 bar were observed, which were 1.4 % and 3.1 % of the 

hydraulic head, respectively. Drain DGDJM-5D was kept closed for seventeen hours and 

forty five minutes and drain DGDJI-2D was closed during the next day, for about seven and a 

half hours. In this period of time the reservoir remained at an elevation of 149.9 m. 

Closing drain DGDJM–5D led to an increase in discharges recorded in six drains located in 

the vicinity of the borehole, and an increase of 0.05 bar in uplift pressures recorded in 

piezometers PZB 12 and PZB13-1. Thus, it can be concluded that the water pressure is low 

and that the drain is linked to the adjacent drains and to the mentioned piezometers through 

rock mass discontinuities. Information about changes in discharges recorded in the drainage 

gallery is not available, as discharges were only recorded before the drain was closed. Closing 

drain  DGDJI–2D led to a discharge increase in four of the drains located in its vicinity and to 

an increase of 0.05 bar in piezometer PZB13-1. Flow rates in drains located in the drainage 

gallery before and after closing the drain were not recorded.  

4.5.8.3 Closure of all the drains and piezometers located in block 17-18 

During the development of a global hydraulic model of the dam foundation, presented in 

chapter 6.6, it was found useful to obtain the average water pressure in the foundation of 

block 17-18 and to know how water pressures vary at the base of the dam block. These tests 

were carried out from 5-8 May 2008 with the reservoir level around 148.0 m, as shown in 

Table 4.3. Discharges and water pressures were recorded in normal operating conditions and 

then drains D25 D and D26 D were simultaneously closed. Readings were taken about 21 

hours later, in steady state conditions. Drains D21 D to D24 D were closed afterwards and 

readings were taken again after 21 hours. Measurements are shown in Appendix 1. When both 

drains D25 D and D26 D were closed simultaneously, water pressures of 5.6 and 5.05 bar 

were recorded respectively. Water pressures increased in the surrounding piezometers and 

discharges increased not only in the surrounding drains but also through the leakage from the 

floor of the downstream drainage gallery. The additional closure of drains D21 D to D24 D, 

caused, as expected, further increase in discharges and water pressures in some of the 

boreholes. However, the water pressure at drain D25 D remained 5.6 bar, which was 61 % of 

the hydraulic head, and in drains D21 D to D24 D when closed varied from 0.275 to 2.7 bar, 

which was 3.17 % to 31 % of the hydraulic head. The average percentage of hydraulic head at 

the dam block was around 27 %, but it could be concluded that the high percentage of 

hydraulic head recorded at drain D25 D while carrying out borehole water-inflow tests was 

localised, and therefore of no concern to the stability of the dam. 



 153 

4.5.8.4 Survey of piezometers 

A careful survey of piezometers installed in the arch’s central block (block 13-14) and in 

block 8-9, in the valley bottom close to the left bank, was carried out. In piezometers 

PZB 17-2 and PZB 17-3, in which a zero pressure had been observed, the pressure gauges for 

a range of 0 to 10 bar were installed. However, when the purge valve was opened, a small 

amount of discharge was observed, therefore there must be a water pressure, which is less 

than 0.2 bar, as accuracy of measurement is 0.2 bar in pressure gauges for a range of  0 to 

10 bar. In order to make dam monitoring more accurate, these pressure gauges should be 

replaced by others with a range of 0 to 2 bar and accuracy of 0.05 bar.

4.5.9 Conclusions drawn from tests carried out in Alqueva dam foundation 

Tests carried out in Alqueva dam foundation led to the conclusion that water flows into the 

majority of the boreholes mostly at shallow depths, in an area close to the concrete/rock mass 

interface. From the water-inflow tests carried out in drains and piezometric boreholes located 

in blocks 17-18 and 18-19 it was also possible to conclude that, in this area of the rock mass, 

discontinuities through which water flows link the various boreholes in a relatively large area 

which extends towards downstream, as could be concluded from tests carried out in the 

gallery branch excavated in the rock mass. Conductive discontinuities have a very small 

aperture, as recorded discharges and water pressures in the borehole’s area of influence only 

stabilize after about an hour and a half. 

The plans for the foundation monitoring system usually advise installing piezometers half 

way between drains, in order to observe maximum water pressures. In Alqueva dam, a 

piezometer was installed in each block, halfway between joints.  Boreholes to carry out 

geophysical tests were also drilled approximately in the middle of each block. Borehole 

water-inflow tests allowed the detection of seepage paths linking piezometric borehole 

PZB 13-2 and one of the boreholes where geophysical tests were carried out. The latter 

borehole works as an extra drain, located around 0.5 m from the piezometric borehole. 



   154 

Therefore, water pressure measured in piezometer PZB 13-2 is lower than it would be if the 

borehole where geophysical tests were carried out had not been drilled. It can be concluded 

that greater care should be taken in the design of the foundation monitoring system.    

Following these tests EDIA was requested to close the boreholes where geophysical tests had 

been carried out. It was suggested that a PVC pipe should be installed at each borehole head, 

closed with a screw-cap. Closing the geophysical borehole located close to piezometer 

PZB 13-2 with a pressure gauge at its head would allow confirmation that there is a seepage 

path linking the two holes, as the water pressure in both boreholes would be the same. After 

confirming the existence of this seepage path, it would only be necessary to measure water 

pressures in the piezometers. EDIA closed the boreholes with wooden plugs. 

Both the position and direction of the main discontinuities can be analysed taking a 3D 

imprint, with the aid of a thin sheet of soft rubber wrapped around the inflatable element of 

the packer, fitted with special rubber cement. Once the packer is inflated inside the hole, this 

soft rubber cover is able to take 360° imprints of the inside wall, which can be examined at 

the surface. Although a roll of rubber sheet was available, it was not used in the tests carried 

out within this study as experiments carried out in LNEC’s laboratory led to the conclusion 

that it would be impossible to identify discontinuities with very small apertures, such as those 

in the foundation area being studied. 

4.6 Summary and conclusions drawn from tests carried out in situ 

The testing programme was undertaken to obtain knowledge of seepage patterns underneath 

concrete dams. From the tests carried out in both Pedrógão and Alqueva dam it was not only 

possible to draw some conclusions about the depth at which the seepage paths cross each one 

of the tested boreholes, about the distribution of discharges and water pressures along the 

boreholes, and about seepage paths linking various boreholes, but also to verify previously 

defined test procedures and detect some faults in the monitoring plan definition. Results 

analysis showed that tests are better carried out with both single and double packers, as the 

two sets of results provide different and additional information. Test results, analysed in 

conjunction with other available information, such as site geological and geotechnical data 

and results of water electrical conductivity analyses, are very useful to better define the 

complex flow system in specific zones of the foundations of operating dams. The 

simultaneous analysis of water pressures and discharges at each test interval can give 

information about the aperture of the discontinuities through which water flows.  

Tests carried out in Pedrógão dam foundation showed that seepage velocities are very high 

and that both boreholes tested were crossed by seepage paths in an area close to the 

concrete/rock mass interface. Both boreholes tested are relevant regarding water pressure 



 155 

relief but this decrease in water pressures is achieved with a high increase in discharges. On 

the contrary, in Alqueva dam foundation seepage velocity is very low, which leads to 

clogging of drilled boreholes and, possibly of the foundation discontinuities. Tests provided 

an indication of the seepage pattern, showing that water flows into the majority of the 

boreholes in an area close to the concrete/rock mass interface and that the drainage boreholes 

are linked through conductive discontinuities in a relatively large area. The high percentage of 

hydraulic head recorded in one of the tested drains was localised and therefore not significant 

regarding the safety of the dam even if it were closed or clogged. 

As noted throughout this chapter, there are situations in which borehole water-inflow tests 

cannot be carried out, for example in boreholes filled with coarse sand or where geodrains 

have been installed.  

Great attention was paid to detect any test feature which could be improved and slight but 

effective changes were gradually introduced. A further improvement would be to introduce an 

automatic data collection system as in fact, during tests, water pressures displayed at the 

recording device were written by hand on test data sheets at pre-established time intervals. 

More detailed and accurate information on variations in water pressures during tests could be 

easily obtained via a data logger linked to a laptop.  

Water-inflow test procedures were defined so as to obtain as much information as possible. 

However, these procedures can be simplified, depending on the information required. In the 

tests presented here, time was allowed in each test step to reach steady state conditions. If 

only approximate water pressures and discharges in each test interval were sufficient, readings 

could have been taken in transient conditions, which would significantly decrease the time 

taken to carry out tests. In this way, a large area of the foundation could be analysed in a 

relatively short period of time. Water electrical conductivity analysis proved to be a quick and 

accurate way to obtain information about the depth at which seepage paths cross the boreholes 

and therefore it can be used to identify these areas in the majority of the Portuguese concrete 

dams, in which discharges are usually low. 

Although some recent methods have shown increasing possibilities to assist with assessment 

of seepage conditions, such as infrared imaging and methods which correlate seepage with 

magnetic fields or with subsurface temperature, they are not yet routinely used. The tests 

presented in this chapter supplement the usual seepage information available from drains and 

piezometers and could in future be used in other dams, as they allow the assessment of 

seepage patterns underneath the dam. At a given dam, the use of borehole water-inflow tests 

and water electrical conductivity analysis with the reservoir at different levels, will probably 

allow the detection of changes in seepage paths due to changes in loads. The knowledge 

obtained is relevant regarding the identification of possible failure modes and therefore helps 



   156 

in the development of an appropriate monitoring programme, which indirectly contributes to a 

greater safety assessment of the dam.

5 Numerical modelling of seepage in concrete dam foundations 

5.1 Introduction 

The performance and safety assessment of concrete dams, which have their foundations on 

rock masses, are based on the analysis of monitoring data and their comparison with 

numerical results. To study the dam foundation hydraulic behaviour and ensure reliable 

predictions of total discharges and hydraulic heads it is not only necessary to take into account 

the complexity of the rock mass, but also to model both the grout curtain and the drainage 

system properly. The grout curtain is usually modelled assuming an area of lower hydraulic 

conductivity. The drain can be modelled by its axis, but the choice of mesh size in the vicinity 

of the drain must be carefully analysed. Modelling each one of the drains in 3D models of 

dam foundations leads to excessively fine meshes, which are very difficult to use. Whenever 

possible, 2D models of dam foundation vertical sections are used. In these models, the 

modelling of the drainage curtain is equivalent to a hypothetical trench in the perpendicular 

direction of the section being studied. 

Analysis presented in this chapter is based on the assumption of an equivalent continuum. The 

performance of the FLAC model in hydraulic analysis was first assessed. For this, two simple 

flow cases were studied: i) steady state seepage flow towards a single drain through a 

confined aquifer; and ii) steady state seepage flow through a horizontal plane in a dam 

foundation (2D horizontal plane model). For both cases, analysed with FLAC 4.0 (Itasca 

2002), the numerical results were compared with analytical solutions, in terms of discharges 

and heads. Two-dimensional numerical simulations were performed with various grids, so as 

to study the influence of the mesh size. The representation of the drain by its actual geometry 

or, in a simplified manner, by its axis was also examined. Three-dimensional analysis of 

seepage was afterwards carried out with 3DEC (Itasca 2003). The performance of both FLAC 

and 3DEC codes was compared using the second above-mentioned flow case. Finally, to 

assess and check the performance of the code 3DEC in unconfined steady state flow analysis, 

i.e. flows bounded above by a phreatic surface, the steady state flow in a homogeneous, 

isotropic and continuum media between two reservoirs was numerically analysed. 

The dimensions of Alqueva dam were taken as reference and a 3D numerical model of a 

vertical slice of the foundation below the central cantilever was developed. This model was 

used to study the influence of drainage, of boundary conditions, of grout curtain permeability, 

of model size and of mesh size. The same model was used to compare the results of a 3D 

model with those obtained both with an equivalent 2D vertical model and with the 2D 

horizontal plane model.

5.2.1 Radial flow to a single well 

The analysis of flow to a single well can often be solved by analytical methods. This analysis 

is particularly important as the study to multiple wells and many problems involving 

complicated boundary conditions can be solved by superposition of solutions for single well 

problems (USACE 1993), using a linear combination of basic solutions, in order to satisfy 

boundary conditions. 

5.2.1.1 Analytical solution 

The solution of the steady state seepage flow towards a single well through a confined 

aquifer, in a homogeneous and isotropic media (Figure 5.1), can be obtained by integrating 

Darcy’s law or the one-dimensional Laplace equation (Bear 1988; Muskat 1946) and is 

written as:

where T = transmissivity of aquifer (m

((m

2
); ?w = water density (kg/m

D = aquifer thickness (m). In Equation 5.1, H = total head at the outer boundary (m); h = total 

head at well (m); Q = constant discharge from well (m
3
/s); R = radius of influence, or radius 

beyond which the well has no influence (m); and r = radius of the well (m). 

5.2.1.2 Geometry and boundary conditions 

The steady state seepage flow towards a cylindrical drain was numerically analysed. A drain 

diameter of 0.076 m was assumed, which is the usual dimension of the drainage boreholes. 

The radius of influence is 10 m (model boundary is at 10 m from the hole centre), and a layer 

of 0.5 m is considered. The hydraulic conductivity is 2.0 × 10
-7

 m/s, the total head at the outer 

boundary is 100 m and at the drain is 50 m. The initial hydraulic head of the domain is 50 m. 

Taking into account Equation 5.1, the discharge from the drain is 5.6374 × 10

flow) (adapted from USACE 1993). 

5.2.1.3 Axisymmetric model 

Analysis was carried out with an axisymmetric model with the axis of symmetry along the 

axis of the hole. To study the differences in the results when the diameter of the hole is and is 

not considered, numerical analysis was carried out taking into account the diameter of the 

hole (left boundary at x = 0.038 m) or modelling the drain by its axis (diameter null and left 

boundary aligned with the hole axis). The model is 10 m wide by 0.5 m high. The axis of the 

hole is aligned with the left boundary of the domain, where x = 0 m. 

To evaluate the effect of mesh size in the vicinity of the drain on solution accuracy different 

grids were considered: in the direction of the hole axis (y) grids contain just one row of 

elements, with a width of 0.5 m; in the radial direction (x) grids with 10, 31, 50, 75 and 100 

elements are considered, spaced uniformly within the domain or spaced in a way that the 

element size increases according to a geometric ratio between successive element sizes 

(FLAC optional ratio keyword). 

Figure 5.2 shows some of the meshes used. The numerical values of the discharges in some 

numerical analyses and their difference, in percentage, to the analytical solution are shown in 

Table 5.1. For eight of the cases studied, Figure 5.3 shows the piezometric heads in the radial 

direction, obtained by the numerical and analytical approaches. Figure 5.4 shows the 

difference between numerical discharge and the analytical solution with an increase in the 

number of mesh elements when the drain is modelled by its diameter.

5.2.1.4 Results analysis 

The results presented show that: 

1. If the diameter of the hole is taken into account, the finer the mesh in the vicinity of 

the drain the better the comparison between FLAC results and the analytical solution 

(both in drain discharges and in hydraulic heads). However, accurate results are 

obtained if the dimension of the first element near the hole is close to the drain radius 

(for example, grid with 31 elements and ratio 1.1). 

2. In some of the cases studied the error when the drain is modelled by its axis is smaller 

than when the drain hole is considered (10 elements and ratio 1.2 or 31 elements 

spaced uniformly). This difference in the error is due to the fact that, in this model, the 

numerical result converges to the analytical solution by superior values, which means 

that the permeability of the numerical model is greater than the real one. When the 

drain is modelled by its axis and the hole is not considered, the permeability of the 

domain is reduced, so the error of modelling the drain by its axis compensates the 

error of considering a permeability value greater than the real one. 

3. If the drain is modelled by its axis, finer meshes in the vicinity of the drain lead to the 

solution of flow towards a drain with an infinitesimal diameter. Figure 5.3 shows that 

when a grid with 31 elements is considered, the numerical values of piezometric heads 

are closer to the analytical values when the elements are spaced uniformly than when a 

finer mesh in the vicinity of the drain is considered (ratio 1.1). In order to determine 

the most suitable dimension of the element close to the drain, a series of numerical 

experiments was carried out that lead to the conclusion that it must be greater than 

0.27 m (slightly greater than three times the diameter of the hole). 



 163 

From the study carried out the conclusion was drawn that numerical errors occur when the 

dimension of the first element close to the drain is less than 0.0001 mm and the analyses are 

run with the single-precision version of FLAC. The double-precision version solves this 

problem. 

5.2.1.5 Influence of the radius beyond which the drain has no influence 

To check if a different radius of influence would alter the most suitable dimension of the 

element close to the drain, new numerical analysis was carried out modelling the drain by its 

axis and using R = 100 m. In this case, with the same permeability and boundary conditions as 

used previously, drain discharge is 3.9892 × 10

3
/s. Table 5.2 shows the numerical 

discharges and the difference, in percentage, to the analytical solution. Table 5.3 summarizes 

the results obtained with the domain divided into 10 and into 31 elements, in which it can be 

verified that the most suitable dimension of the first element close to the drain is independent 

of the radius of influence.  

5.2.1.6 Influence of the drain diameter 

Finally, to check the influence of the drain diameter, new numerical analysis was carried out 

modelling the drain by its axis and using drain diameters 2 and 10 times greater than the usual 

dimension of the drainage boreholes (?1 = 0.152 m and ?2 = 0.76 m). In these cases, with 

R = 100 m and the permeability and boundary conditions previously used, drain discharge is

difference, in percentage, to the analytical solutions, and Table 5.6 shows the ratio between 

the most suitable dimension of the element close to the drain and the drain diameter. Results 

show that whatever the drain diameter the most suitable dimension is equal to around 3.5 

times the drain diameter. In coarser meshes (R = 100 m and ? = 0.152 m) the ratio is slightly 

lower, around 3.1.

5.2.2 Two-dimensional horizontal model of seepage in a concrete dam 

foundation  

The two-dimensional horizontal model of seepage flow through a concrete dam foundation 

consists of a horizontal section in any plane of the foundation (concrete/rock mass interface or 

any other plane below the contact) in which the drainage curtain is represented and where the 

fluid boundary conditions are the heights of water above the considered plane, upstream and 

downstream of the dam, respectively. 

In this model, in which the existence of the grout curtain is neglected, it is assumed that the 

flow takes place in a homogeneous and isotropic medium. To study the seepage flow through 

a horizontal plane in a dam foundation, the dimensions of Alqueva dam were taken into 

account. FLAC results were compared to the analytical solution (Andrade 1982). 



   166 

5.2.2.1 Analytical solution 

To study the seepage flow through the dam foundation a simplified numerical model was used 

in which it is assumed that an impervious dam rests on a finite, homogeneous, isotropic and 

pervious layer (Andrade 1982). In this model the fluid flow is horizontal and takes place from 

a vertical fissure that comes from the heel of the dam, where the reservoir pressure is 

assumed, towards a vertical fissure that comes from the toe of the dam, where the tailwater 

pressure is applied. It is assumed that both the vertical fissures and the drains reach the rock 

foundation’s impervious base. Water flow obeys Darcy’s law. Figure 5.5 shows the numerical 

model. 

In this model a portion of the total discharge that flows into the domain from upstream (qu) 

flows to the drains (qdrain) and the rest flows towards downstream (qd):

In Figure 5.5 and in Equations 5.3-5.7, a  = spacing between drains (m); b = distance from the

drainage curtain (m); Pd = pressure at the drain given by the distance from the drain head to 

the considered plane (m); ? = coefficient to correct the permeability in the line of drains; 

Hu and Hd = heights of the reservoir and of the tailwater above the considered plane, 

respectively; y = thickness of the pervious layer (m); and c = base width of the dam (m).

Figure 5.5 – Seepage in a dam foundation: numerical model (after Andrade 1982). 

In a homogeneous and isotropic media, the value of ?, which represents the effect of the 

drainage curtain in the foundation, is a function of the spacing between drains (a) and of the 

drain perimeter (p) and is given by: 

p

a
a ln

2 ?
? ?  (5.8) 

In Equations 5.5 and 5.7, Pd is the pressure at the drain, usually assumed to be a function of 

the distance from the drain head to the plane in which seepage is being studied. In this case, it 

is assumed that the water pressure at the drain head is zero, which is suitable in the majority 

of cases as seepage velocity inside the drains is normally low. However, in rock masses with 

high permeability and dams in which the drains are inappropriate, the water pressure may be 

higher than that given by the drain head. On the contrary, it is also possible that the water 

inside the drain does not reach the drain head. Thus, when modelling seepage in the 

foundation of operating dams, the water pressure at the drainage line must be as close as 

possible to that monitored. 

This model also enables the study of seepage in an anisotropic media, with different 

permeability in the plane of flow and in the perpendicular plane where the drainage system is 

located, using a different coefficient to correct the permeability in the line of drains. Seepage 

velocity close to and inside the drains, and water pressures, may also be calculated, taking 

into account discharges at the drainage line.  



   168 

5.2.2.2 Geometry and boundary conditions 

The steady state seepage flow through a horizontal plane in Alqueva dam foundation was 

analysed, at a plane 9.5 m below the dam/foundation interface, which is at level 58.0 m 

(Figure 5.6). The drains are assumed to be vertical and, as mentioned in the previous chapter, 

have 25.0 m of length, 0.076 m of diameter and are located 3.0 m apart. The reservoir level is 

143.0 m and the tailwater level is 75.0 m. The drain head is at an elevation of 61.0 m. The 

hydraulic conductivity is assumed to be 2.0 × 10
-7

 m/s. The base width of the dam is 33.4 m 

and the distance between the upstream face and the drainage curtain is 7.5 m. Due to 

symmetry, the numerical model extends from drain centre to a distance half way between 

drains. Given the dimensions listed above, the model is 33.4 m wide by 1.5 m high . 

For this particular problem, taking Figure 5.5 and Equations 5.3 to 5.8 into account, the value 

for Sd is 23.975 m and the values for the discharges, per metre of width of the model, are

5.2.2.3 Results analysis 

To assess the influence of modelling the drain by its axis, numerical analysis was also carried 

out taking into account the diameter of the hole. The complete mesh has 1500 (100 × 15) 

elements. In the first two mesh details shown in Figure 5.7 the dimension of the elements in 

the vicinity of the drain is, in both directions, about 0.05 m, i.e. slightly greater than the drain 

radius. A third mesh was considered in which the x-dimension of the elements close to the 

drain is about 0.027 m. As Figure 5.7 indicates, the meshes have increasing zone size away 

from the drain. The numerical values of the discharges and their difference, in percentage, to 

the analytical solution are shown in Table 5.7. Figure 5.8 shows, for the meshes that lead to 

more accurate results, the variations in hydraulic head along five lines.

 171 

Comparison of discharges calculated with the first two meshes (Table 5.7) shows that when 

the drain is modelled by its axis the flow into the drain is 10 % lower than when the drain is 

modelled by its diameter. The third mesh, in which the drain is modelled by its axis and the 

dimension of the elements in the vicinity of the drain is around 0.27 m, leads to the discharges 

closest to the analytical solution. In comparison with the results obtained with the mesh in 

which the drain is modelled by its diameter, discharges obtained with this third mesh are 

closer to the analytical solution, but the average value of the hydraulic head in the line of 

drains is less accurate. As in the case of seepage flow towards a single drain, modelling the 

drain by its axis is feasible, but the mesh can not be too fine close to the drain. Elements close 

to the drain in the mesh shown in Figure 5.7 b) are too small, and therefore results are not 

accurate. 

Numerical analysis was carried out with a fourth mesh in which the dimension of the elements 

in the vicinity of the drain is, in both directions, about 3.5 times the drain diameter and it was 

concluded that the size of the elements in the direction of the drainage line has almost no 

influence on numerical results. 

Figure 5.8 shows that hydraulic heads obtained with the mesh shown in Figure 5.7 c) are very 

close to those obtained with the mesh in which the drain is modelled by its diameter (shown 

in Figure 5.7 a)). 

If instead of a drainage curtain with drains with 0.076 m of diameter located 3.0 m apart, there 

is a hypothetical continuous trench with the same depth of the drains, the flow into this trench 

can be calculated using Equation 5.4, taking for Sd the value of the hydraulic head at the drain. 

For this problem the value of the discharge at the trench would be 6.56 × 10
-6

 (m
3
/s)/m, which 

is around 15 % higher than the flow into the drainage line. Therefore, when there is a drainage 

curtain with drains with a diameter of 0.076 m located 3.0 m apart, the quantity of water that 

flows into the drains is 87 % (qdrain/qtrench = 0.87) of that which would flow into a trench. If the 

drains are located 6.0 m apart, the total discharge at the drainage line is 9.005 × 10
-6

 (m
3
/s)/m. 

The total discharge at the trench would be twice that calculated with drains 3.0 m apart. 

Therefore, when the drains are located 6.0 m apart, the quantity of water that flows into the 

drains is 69 % of that which would flow into a trench. 

Results here presented show that: 

1. If the diameter of the hole is taken into account accurate results are obtained if the 

dimensions of the elements adjacent to the drain are close to the drain diameter. 

2. For meshes of the same order, the flow into the drain when it is modelled by its axis is 

10 % smaller than when the drain is modelled by its diameter. 



   172 

3. Sensitivity studies determined that if the drain is modelled by its axis the dimension of 

the elements in the vicinity of the drain should not be lower than 0.27 m (confirms one 

of the conclusions drawn in section 5.2.1). 

4. The total discharge at a drainage curtain, with drains with a diameter of 0.076 m 

located 3.0 m apart, is 87 % of the total discharge at a hypothetical trench with the 

same depth as the drains. This result is particularly important both in 

three-dimensional models, where it is not possible to model each one of the drains, 

and in 2D models of vertical cross sections of the dam foundation. 

5.2.3 Seepage in a horizontal layer 

The performance of 3DEC and FLAC was compared studying the steady state seepage flow in 

a horizontal layer of a dam foundation, using the 2D horizontal model of seepage presented in 

the previous section (section 5.2.2). With this model, a series of studies was carried out in 

which 2D and 3D numerical results, obtained with various meshes, were compared with the 

analytical solution (Andrade 1982). The 3D model is the same size as the 2D model 

previously presented, except for the width, and the same hydraulic properties and loads are 

assumed. 

5.2.3.1 Influence of mesh size 

In the 3D meshes analysed, with a width of 0.1 m, the domain is divided into three blocks and 

the drain is modelled by its axis. The influence of mesh size was studied with four different 

meshes, successively larger, called m1, m2, m3 and m4. In these meshes, the size of the edges 

of the tetrahedral zones increases gradually from the drain and in the radial direction from ec 

to ed, in a distance of 7.5 m to both the right and left hand side of the drain. In the remaining 

domain the average size of the tetrahedral edges is fixed, and is assumed to be, in each mesh, 

equal to ed. Figure 5.9 shows one of the meshes used in the 2D analysis and the division into 

blocks used in the 3D models, along with an internal mesh. 

Table 5.8 shows the geometric characteristics of each mesh and the numerical discharges at 

the drain and in both the upstream and downstream boundaries. The same table shows the 

comparison with the analytical solution (as a percentage). Discharges are more accurate when 

mesh m2 is used, in which element edges close to the drain are around 20 cm. As meshes m1 

and m2 lead to discharges lower than those obtained with the analytical solution and mesh m3 

to higher discharges, the use of a mesh with ed = 0.4 and ec between 20 and 30 cm allows 

better results to be obtained. Results presented in Table 5.8 are consistent with the 

conclusions drawn so far regarding the representation of the drain: i) as the drain is being 



 173 

downstream upstream 

modelled by its axis, the mesh must not be too fine close to the drain (as in mesh m1); and 

ii) for finer meshes it would be necessary to model the drain by its diameter.

5.2.3.2 Comparison between the results of 2D and 3D models 

The simultaneous analysis of results from the 2D horizontal plane model (Table 5.7) and from 

the 3D model of flow through a horizontal layer (Table 5.8) shows that the 3DEC’s mesh m2 

leads to the closest results both to the analytical solution and to the best results obtained with 

the FLAC’s plane model, in the case in which the drain is modelled by its diameter. 

The variation of the hydraulic head along 3 different lines is shown from Figure 5.10 to

Figure 5.12 – Comparison between variations in the hydraulic head along the line 

perpendicular to the line of drains, midway between drains, in the 2D and 3D models. 

 

The results presented in Table 5.7, in Table 5.8 and in Figure 5.10 to Figure 5.12 show that: 

1. Discharges obtained with the 3D fine mesh m1 are close to those obtained with the 

fine plane mesh in which the drain is modelled by its axis. However, both meshes are 

too fine and give results that are not close to the solution.   

2. In the 3D model, if the mesh is enlarged and mesh m2 instead of mesh m1 is used, the 

discharge increases, which compensates for the error of not representing the drain by 

its diameter. 



   176 

3. As the mesh is further enlarged (meshes m3 and m4) discharges increase and the 

hydraulic head along the different lines decreases. It is worth noting, however, that 

with mesh m4 the error is still small (around 5 %). 

4. The solutions that lead to discharges closer to the analytical solution and to closer 

lines of variation in hydraulic head are obtained with the plane model in which the 

drain is represented by its diameter and with the 3D mesh m2.  

5. Along the different lines it is observed that the model in which the hydraulic heads are 

further away from the analytical solution, by superior values, is the plane model with 

the drain modelled by its axis. The 3D model with the finer mesh m1, also leads to 

hydraulic heads higher than those obtained with the best solutions. It is worth noting 

that the drain is modelled by its axis to allow the use of a coarser mesh, in order to 

reduce run times, and therefore the problem of excessive mesh refinement is not likely 

to occur. 

The study of steady state flow through a horizontal layer with 3D models leads to basically 

the same conclusions as those obtained in 2D analysis: in 3D models, as in 2D models, the 

most suitable size of the elements in the vicinity of the drain is about three times the drain 

diameter. 

5.2.4 Unconfined steady state flow 

To test 3DEC’s formulation for unconfined groundwater steady state flows, i.e. flows 

bounded above by a phreatic surface, the problem of flow between two reservoirs through a 

continuous, homogeneous and isotropic medium was numerically analysed. Water enters and 

leaves the pervious medium through vertical boundaries. 

It is very difficult to study flows in which one of the boundary conditions is the phreatic 

surface, not only because it is a nonlinear boundary condition, but also because the position of 

this boundary is, a priori, unknown (Bear 1988). However, to study unconfined flows Dupuit 

developed, and published in 1863, a theory based on a number of simplifying assumptions 

resulting from the observation that in most groundwater flows the slope of the phreatic 

surface is not very steep. Therefore, Dupuit assumed that in flows in phreatic aquifers: i) the 

hydraulic gradient is equal to the slope of the phreatic surface; ii) the flow is essentially 

horizontal; and iii) equipotential surfaces are vertical (Figure 5.13). 

With the simplified assumptions established by Dupuit, it is possible to integrate the 

differential equation obtained from Darcy’s law. Thus the Dupuit simplification leads to the 

specific discharge expressed by (known as the Dupuit-Forchheimer discharge formula):

where Q = discharge per model unit width ((m

/s)/m); kH = hydraulic conductivity (m/s); 

L = distance between the two reservoirs (m); H1 = highest hydraulic head (m); H2 = lowest 

hydraulic head (m). 

Although the shape of the phreatic surface is approximate, the discharge is the exact value 

(Bear 1988). 

Analysis done with 3DEC allows the logic for flow inside a block divided into tetrahedral 

zones with free surface to be tested. A media with a permeability of 1 × 10
-3

 m/s was 

assumed, of which the boundaries are defined by a brick shape 4 m long (x), 2 m high (y) and 

0.2 m wide (z), between two reservoirs with hydraulic heads of 2 m and 1 m, respectively. In 

this case, the total discharge is 7.5 × 10

/s. Meshes were automatically generated in two 

different ways: first, irregular meshes, from the average edge length of the tetrahedral-shaped 

zones, in which average edge lengths of 0.9 m, 0.4 m and 0.2 m were used; second, regular 

meshes only possible for brick elements, from the number of divisions along each axis, where 

1 zone along z axis, 4 zones along y and 8 zones along x or 1 zone along z axis, 8 zones along 

y and 16 zones along x were used. In this second case the divisions create brick shape 

volumes which are internally divided into tetrahedra. For both cases numerical discharges 

were compared with the analytical solution. Analysis of Table 5.9 leads to the conclusion that 

the results are quite accurate. The slight difference between numerical discharges and the 

analytical solution are due to approximations involved in the simulation of the free surface.

5.3 Three-dimensional hydraulic models of concrete dam foundations 

5.3.1 Introduction 

The 2D horizontal seepage model presented in section 5.2.2 does not take into account the 

effect of the grout curtain. Therefore, to study seepage flow in a concrete dam foundation, a 

3D model is used in this section, in which both the grout and drainage curtains are simulated. 

In this first phase of analysis, flow is modelled in a foundation slice that extends from 

upstream from the dam towards downstream but whose width is only 1.5 m, which is half of 

the distance between drains. The influence of different factors such as drainage, boundary 

conditions, grout curtain permeability, model size and mesh size are analysed, and the results 

of a 3D model are compared with those obtained with a 2D model, using the same mesh and 

the same numerical code. 

5.3.2 Model characteristics 

The dimensions of Alqueva dam were used as reference and two 3D numerical models of part 

of the area of the foundation below the central cantilever were developed. A first model, 

called small model, has a width of around 60 m, a height of 50 m and, taking advantage of 

symmetry, a thickness of 1.5 m. The upper boundary of the model is at the same elevation as 

the dam/foundation interface (58.0 m). It was assumed that the grout curtain, which crosses 

the whole model width, is 1 m thick. The drain is modelled by its axis (diameter zero) and the 

drain is at the model boundary (z = 1.5 m). The model was divided into 8 blocks, internally 

divided into 68019 tetrahedra, with a total of 19330 grid points (Figure 5.15). The mesh is 

finer close to the drain and the relative position of the grout and drainage curtains is respected. 

The mesh was defined by the average edge length of the tetrahedral zones, which increases, 

radially and gradually, from 0.4 m to 0.8 m, from the upper point of the drain to the external 

boundary. The number of zones across the model’s thickness decreases gradually from 4 to 1 

from the drain area to the lower boundary. Figure 5.15 shows the position of the grout curtain 

and the drain, of which the depth is about half of the grout curtain’s length and, in the mesh, 

ends at the horizontal joint. The same figure shows the blocks around the grout and drainage 

curtains, and the mesh which is automatically generated. 

The above-mentioned model was used to develop a second, called large model, adding blocks 

upstream, downstream and downwards. This new domain, with 150.0 × 78.0 × 1.5 m
3
 was 

divided into thirteen blocks, internally divided into 189076 tetrahedra, with a total of 49910 

grid points (Figure 5.16). In these new blocks the average edge length of the tetrahedral zones 

is 1.0 m.  



   180 

It is assumed that the rock mass foundation is homogeneous and isotropic with a permeability 

of 1.0 × 10
-7

 m/s. The grout curtain dips 20° towards upstream, is located about 7.0 m 

downstream from the upstream face and is 41 m long. The drainage curtain is located about 

0.5 m downstream from the grout curtain and dips 5° towards upstream but it was assumed to 

be vertical, in order to simplify the model. The numerical analyses were carried out assuming 

the reservoir at an elevation of 143.0 m and the water downstream from the dam at an 

elevation of 75.0 m. A zero pressure was assumed at the drain head.

5.3.3 Influence of grout curtain permeability in a foundation with no drainage 

system 

The small model was used to carry out seepage analysis assuming the hydraulic head on the 

upstream and downstream lateral boundaries and considering that a grout curtain was installed 

in the dam foundation, but no drainage boreholes were drilled. Therefore, the water entering 

the model from the upstream boundary flows directly towards downstream. Table 5.10 shows 

the numerical discharges for different values of kgrout curtain/krock mass: i) the grout curtain with 

the same permeability as the rock mass (it simulates seepage in a foundation with no grout 

curtain); ii) grout curtain 10 times less pervious than the rock mass; iii) grout curtain 100 

times less pervious than the rock mass; and iv) grout curtain 1000 times more impervious than 

the rock mass. The results of a run in which the grout curtain permeability was assumed to be 

zero and of another run in which the zones corresponding to the grout curtain were deleted are 

also shown.  

The main aim of grouting is to reduce discharges and seepage velocity. Results in Table 5.10 

show that, taking the situation without grout curtain as reference, the quantity of water that 

flows through the model decreases by about: 

- 9 % if  the grout curtain permeability is 1/10 of that of the rock mass; 

- 36 % if the grout curtain permeability is 1/100 of that of the rock mass; 

- 50 % if the grout curtain permeability is 1/1000 of that of the rock mass; 

- 53 % if it is assumed that kgrout curtain = 0.0 or if the zones simulating the grout curtain are 

deleted.

   182 

Results also show that to assume an impervious grout curtain it is sufficient to assume that the 

grout curtain is 1000 times less pervious than the surrounding rock mass. Numerical analysis 

shows that with 3DEC it is possible to simulate an impervious grout curtain, without 

computational problems, not only deleting the zones simulating the grout curtain but also 

assuming that its permeability is zero. The small difference between the results obtained in 

these two situations is due to a slight difference in a scaling parameter used by the 3DEC 

algorithm for steady state solutions. 

In the 3DEC explicit algorithm, run time increases when the differences in the permeability of 

the different groups of elements are large, therefore it is not advisable to assume very low 

numbers for the grout curtain permeability. In practice, as it was concluded, a ratio of 1:1000 

is enough. If a more impervious grout curtain is to be assumed, zero permeability should be 

considered, which avoids the zones simulating the grout curtain being included in seepage 

analysis. 

5.3.4 Influence of drainage 

The small model was used to carry out numerical analysis identical to that presented in the 

previous sub-chapter, assuming that the dam foundation not only has a grout curtain but also a 

drainage curtain. The drain is modelled by its axis, and the hydraulic head of the drain’s head 

is assumed along the axis. Table 5.11 shows the numerical discharges for different 

kgrout curtain/krock mass. 

Taking as reference the situation without drainage, the results of which are presented in the 

previous section, it can be seen that the quantity of water flowing into the model increases by 

around:  

- 76 % if the grout curtain permeability is the same as the rock mass permeability;  

- 64 % if the grout curtain permeability is 1/10 of that of the rock mass; 

- 34 % if the grout curtain permeability is 1/100 of that of the rock mass; 

- 22 % if the grout curtain permeability is 1/1000 of that of the rock mass; 

- 20 % if it is assumed that the grout curtain is impervious.  

Taking as reference the situation in which no grout curtain is considered, it can be seen that 

drain discharge decreases: 

- by around 14.5 % if the grout curtain is 10 times less pervious than the surrounding rock 

mass;  

- to about half (decreases 48.3 %) if the grout curtain is 100 times less pervious than the 

rock mass;  



 183 

- by around 62 % to 64 % in the situations where an impervious grout curtain is assumed, 

namely, when it is assumed that the grout curtain is 1000 times less pervious than the 

rock mass, kgrout curtain = 0.0, or without zones in the grout curtain area. 

Analysis of discharges flowing into or out of each gridpoint in the upstream and downstream 

boundaries and along the drain show that, in this model with both grout and drainage curtains, 

the water enters the domain from the upstream boundary, flows out of the model from the 

drain and, in the downstream boundary, enters the domain above a certain level, and flows out 

of the domain below that level. This level varies with kgrout curtain/krock mass: when the grout 

curtain permeability is the same as that of the rock mass, the above-mentioned elevation is 

37.0 m; if kgrout curtain/krock mass = 0.1, the elevation is 36.0 m; if kgrout curtain/krock mass = 0.01, the 

elevation is 32.5 m; and in the remaining situations, it is 31.0 m. 

The main aim of drainage is to reduce the hydraulic head. Figure 5.17 shows a comparison

5.3.5 Influence of boundary conditions 

Small model 

In the numerical analysis presented in the previous sub-chapters, the upstream and 

downstream hydraulic heads were assumed in the lateral boundaries, therefore it is assumed 

that water flows out of the model through the drain and flows into or out of the model through 

vertical boundaries that go down through the rock mass. To study the influence of boundary 

conditions, a different situation was analysed, still with the small model, in which it is 

assumed that the lateral and bottom boundaries are impervious, as well as the dam 

concrete/rock mass interface. In this case, water flows into and out of the domain, with the 

exception of the drain, through the rock mass surface, upstream and downstream from the 

dam, where the upstream and downstream hydraulic heads are assumed. Seepage close to an 

impervious boundary is parallel to that boundary. Figure 5.18 shows the two above-mentioned 

boundary conditions. Table 5.12 shows the numerical discharges in each situation, assuming 

different relationships between the grout curtain and rock mass permeability. 

Table 5.12 shows that when the lateral and bottom boundaries and the dam/rock mass 

interface are assumed to be impervious (case b) in Figure 5.18), discharges flowing out of the 

drain, when kgrout curtain/krock mass is 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001, are 87 %, 72 % and 66 %, respectively, 

of discharges determined when the hydraulic heads are assumed in the vertical boundaries 

upstream and downstream from the domain. Percentages of water flowing into the model 

from upstream, for each the above-mentioned situations are 80 %, 67 % and 59 %, 

respectively. Figure 5.19 shows the hydraulic head contours in each situation.

Table 5.12 – Small model. Discharges for different boundary conditions and different 

relationships between the grout curtain and rock mass permeability. 

 

Figure 5.20 shows the variations in the hydraulic head along nine 50 m long vertical lines, for 

each of the above-mentioned boundary conditions, when the grout curtain permeability is 10 

times lower than that of the rock mass. The location of the vertical lines is shown underneath. 

From the analysis of Figure 5.19 and Figure 5.20 it can be concluded that, when the hydraulic 

head is assumed on the upstream and downstream lateral boundaries, the variation of the 

hydraulic head along the vertical lines close to the drain (lines 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) is about 30 m. 

This variation is independent of the grout curtain permeability. Indeed, if it is assumed that 

the grout curtain is 100 or 1000 times less pervious than the rock mass, the hydraulic head 

along the vertical lines is slightly less but the difference between the maximum and minimum 

does not change. 

When the lateral and bottom boundaries and the dam/foundation interface are assumed to be 

impervious, the head loss on the upstream boundary is about 54 m and the variation in the 

hydraulic head along the vertical lines close to the drain is about 14 m. 

With this small model, the hypothesis of assuming the hydraulic head on the upstream and 

downstream vertical boundaries, as it neglects the head loss in vertical seepage, mainly in the 

upstream area, leads to greater discharges at the drains. However, to draw conclusions about 

the vertical seepage, the model should be larger in the upstream area. Moreover, it is not 

realistic to assume that the upper boundary is impervious, as the rock mass surface is 

pervious. Therefore, to analyse seepage in concrete dam foundations it is adequate to consider 

the hydraulic head on the rock mass surface, upstream and downstream from the dam, and 

assume the lateral surfaces, the bottom surface and the dam/foundation interface to be 

impervious.

Figure 5.20 – Small model. Variation in hydraulic head along 50 m long vertical lines for the 

two different boundary conditions (assuming that the grout curtain permeability is 10 times 

lower than that of the rock mass). 

 

Large model 

In the small model the boundaries are too close to the area of interest, namely the bottom 

boundary in relation to the grout curtain. In the large model, boundaries are further away from 

the seepage area of interest. To study the influence of the boundary conditions five cases were 

compared, assuming in all of them that the grout curtain permeability is 100 times lower than 



 189 

that of the rock mass. The considered boundary conditions are described and represented in 

Figure 5.21, together with the hydraulic head contours. The numerical discharges in each of 

the cases studied can be found in Table 5.13.  

The analysis of Figure 5.21 and of the values presented in Table 5.13 allows the comparison 

between the different cases: 

- From i) and iii) it is possible to conclude that, when it is assumed that water can get 

into and out of the model not only by the rock mass surface but also by the model 

vertical boundaries, the discharge coming from the upstream boundary increases by 

about 26 %, the discharge into the drain increases by about 13 % and the discharge 

which flows out of the model by the downstream boundary is 6 times greater. It is also 

evident that the discharge coming out from the downstream boundary is almost the 

same in both cases, thus it can be concluded that part of the discharge coming in from 

the area upstream from the dam flows, in case iii), directly to the vertical boundary 

downstream from the dam.  

- From i) e iv) it is possible to conclude that, in the case being studied, the dimension of 

the downstream pervious boundary has almost no influence on the recorded 

discharges. In both cases, the discharge flowing into the drain is about 95 % of the 

discharge coming into the model from the upstream area.  

- Cases ii) and iii) lead to the conclusion that when the hydraulic head is assumed on the 

vertical boundaries, neglecting the vertical hydraulic loss in those areas, the numerical 

discharges are in excess. However, in case ii), in which the entrance of water by the 

upper boundary is not allowed, that error is masked and the value of the discharge in 

the drain is close to the value obtained in case i). 

- In case v), in which the hydraulic head is assumed only at the drain head and not along 

its length, the drainage has almost no influence. 

The study carried out leads to the conclusion that the boundary conditions considered in 

case i), in which the lateral and bottom boundaries as well as the dam/foundation interface are 

assumed to be impervious, are the most suitable boundary conditions to study seepage in 

concrete dam foundations. Figure 5.22 shows, for this case, the variation of the hydraulic head 

along 50 m long vertical lines, in three sections of the plane perpendicular to the line of drains 

that crosses the drain.

5.3.6 Influence of grout curtain permeability 

To assess the influence of grout curtain permeability, the discharges and foundation hydraulic 

head contours with the grout curtain 10, 100, and 1000 times less pervious than the rock mass 

were compared. In practice, the latter is equivalent to simulating an impervious grout curtain. 

Table 5.14 shows the numerical values of the discharges and Figure 5.23 shows the hydraulic 

head contours for a grout curtain 10 and 100 times less pervious than the rock mass.  



   192 

Analysis of the values presented in Table 5.14 leads to the conclusion that, when comparing 

to the case of an impervious grout curtain, the discharges coming into the model from the 

upstream area and into the drain increase by about 37 % and 150 % when the grout curtain is 

100 times or just 10 times less pervious than the rock mass. Decreasing grout curtain 

permeability leads to a significant reduction in the discharges but, as can be seen in Figure 

5.23, has little influence on the hydraulic head contours downstream from the grout curtain.  

5.3.7 Influence of model size 

Methods based on a domain subdivided into a mesh of zones, such as the distinct element 

method used in 3DEC, require the model size to be specifically defined, introducing artificial 

boundaries. These boundaries should be sufficiently far away from the area being studied, so 

that their location does not have an influence on numerical results. To study the influence of 

model size, situations b) and a) of the small model were compared with situations i) and ii) of 

the large model, respectively.  Table 5.15 shows the numerical discharges in each case.

Table 5.15 – Influence of model size. Numerical discharges when the hydraulic head is 

assumed either on the foundation surface upstream and downstream from the dam or on the 

lateral boundaries (kgrout curtain/krock mass = 0.01). 

When the hydraulic head is assumed on the foundation surface, upstream and downstream 

from the dam, the quantity of water that flows into the model through the upstream boundary 

is 42 % greater in the large model than in the small model, and the drain discharge is 30 % 

greater. The small model results are justified not only because they are affected by the small 

size of the upstream pervious boundary but also because the upstream lateral vertical 

boundary, which is impervious, is located very close to the grout curtain. The large difference 

between discharges obtained with the two models reveals that, with these boundary 

conditions, the size of the large model is more appropriate. 

In the second situation studied, in which the hydraulic head is assumed on the lateral model 

boundaries, upstream and downstream, both the drain discharge and the quantity of water 

flowing through the model between the upstream and downstream boundaries at the lower 

elevations are higher than they should be (Table 5.15). In the small model, vertical boundaries 

upstream and downstream are very close to the dam’s area of influence. Boundary conditions 



   194 

assumed in this second situation are less realistic than assuming the hydraulic head on the 

foundation surface. Analysis of results obtained with both models leads to the conclusion that 

the quantity of water that flows into the model from upstream is only 5 % greater in the large 

model than that obtained with the small model, and the drain discharge about 8 % lower. 

However, whilst in the downstream boundary of the small model water flows out of the 

domain for elevations lower than 32.5 m and enters the domain for elevations higher than this, 

in the large model water flows out of the model from all the grid points located at the 

downstream boundary. In this situation the size of the large model is also more appropriate. 

It should be mentioned that in analysis carried out with the small model, convergence in 

steady state conditions is achieved in about 10 × 10
5
 steps, which takes, in this model, two 

and a half hours. In the large model convergence is achieved, in both cases referred to in this 

sub-chapter, in about 3 × 10
5
 steps, which takes about fifteen hours. 

5.3.8 Influence of mesh size 

To assess the influence of the mesh size a second mesh was defined which is similar to the 

mesh shown in Figure 5.16 but coarser. In this mesh, the average edge length of the 

tetrahedral zones increases, radially and gradually, from 0.75 m to the model width (1.5 m), 

from the upper point of the drain to the external boundary of the eight central blocks.  In the 

remaining blocks the zones average edge length is 1.5 m. This mesh has 37422 tetrahedra 

with 13107 grid points, which are about 20 % of the total elements and 26 % of the grid 

points of the initial model. This second mesh has two tetrahedra across the model thickness in 

the vicinity of the drain and only one in the remaining domain.  

In both meshes referred to in the previous paragraph, the average dimension of the tetrahedron 

edges increases radially and gradually, from the upper point of the drain to the external 

boundary of the eight central blocks. The finer mesh has, in the upper area of the drain, four 

elements along its width, thus the average dimension of the tetrahedron edges closer to the 

drain is 0.375 m. However, at the elevation of the drain’s lower end, in the area where the 

majority of the flow comes into the drain, the mesh has just two elements along its width. 

Therefore, a third mesh was defined, based on the first, which is finer in the vicinity of the 

drain and along the drain whole length. In this third mesh, the average length of the 

tetrahedron edges is 30 cm, which is slightly greater than 3.5 times the diameter of the hole. 

This mesh has 20 blocks, 241303 tetrahedra and 61949 grid points.  

The numerical discharges obtained with each model are presented in Table 5.16, assuming 

that the grout curtain permeability is 100 times lower than the rock mass permeability. It is 

possible to conclude that the coarse mesh leads to discharges into the drain just 5.7 % higher 

than the very fine mesh. About 42 % of the drain discharge flows into the drain in its lower 



 195 

5.0 m. The hydraulic head contours obtained with each one of the meshes are almost 

coincident. The differences are due to the fact that the number of elements across the model 

thickness is different, at each elevation, in each one of the models. In the very fine mesh, 

convergence in steady state conditions is achieved in about 4.6 × 10
5
 steps, which takes about 

27.5 hours. With the coarse mesh, convergence is achieved in about 1.32 × 10
5
 steps, which 

takes just one hour and a half.  

From the study carried out it is possible to conclude that when the coarse mesh is used errors 

in discharges and in hydraulic heads are within acceptable limits. The mesh size is not a 

constraint in the present model, which encompasses only a slice of the foundation, but is 

particularly important in a complete foundation model. It may be concluded that in a large 3D 

model a coarse mesh may be used away from the zone of interest. This is the case in chapter 

6, in which a coarse mesh is used away from the drainage area, as shown in Figure 6.19.  

5.3.9 Comparison between the results of 2D and 3D models 

To compare the results of 2D and 3D models, but removing the influence of different meshes 

or different codes, a 2D model was simulated with 3DEC, assuming at the line of the drains 

the same hydraulic head across the model thickness (it simulates a hypothetical continuous 

trench at the line of the drains, as in a 2D model). As the same mesh is used in both models, 

the effect of the mesh size is eliminated.  

The study carried out led to the conclusion that the discharge into the drains in the 3D model 

is about 94 % of the total discharge at the trench. Therefore, if drains with a diameter of 

0.076 m are located 3.0 m apart, and a zero pressure is assumed at the drain heads in a 2D 

model, the discharge into the drain is just 6 % greater than the discharge in a 3D model. But if 

the spacing between drains is 6.0 m, the total discharge at the drainage curtain in the 3D 

model is about 84 % of the total discharge at the trench.

The 2D simulation was repeated assuming at the trench the average value of the hydraulic 

head at the line of the drains (63.03m).  This value was determined taking into account the 

variation of the average value of the hydraulic head in depth and the area of influence at 

different elevations. Table 5.17 shows the numerical values of the discharges with the 3D and 

2D models. In the 2D model, two different hypotheses were considered for the value of the 

hydraulic head at the line of the drains:  

i) the same as the hydraulic head at the drain head;  

ii) the average value of the hydraulic head at the line of the drains. 

It is concluded that if the average value of the hydraulic head at the line of the drains is 

assumed at the trench, which is slightly greater than the hydraulic head at the drain head 

(Figure 5.24), the total discharge at the trench decreases, approaching values closer to the 

discharges at the drains in a 3D model (only 0.5 % greater). The lines of variation of the 

hydraulic head along horizontal lines at different elevations allow the conclusion that 5.0 m 

away from the line of the drains the differences in the piezometric heads are less than 1 %. 

Therefore, 5.0 m away from the line of the drains the numerical values of the 2D and 3D 

models are almost the same. It can be concluded that instead of representing each drain, a 

continuous trench provides good results if the head is properly set.

Table 5.18 shows the average hydraulic heads at the drainage line, at various elevations, 

obtained with the 3D model and with the 2D horizontal model, using the analytical solution 

suggested by Andrade (1982). The results presented were obtained with the assumed most 

suitable boundary conditions, i.e., with the hydraulic head assumed on the rock mass surface 

upstream and downstream from the dam, and with the models with the boundary conditions 

closer to the hypothesis of vertical fissures coming from the heel and toe of the dam.

The 2D horizontal model of seepage through a concrete dam foundation neglects the existence 

of the grout curtain, therefore the average hydraulic head at the drainage line is overestimated. 

As in a horizontal section in any plane of the foundation there is a decrease in the hydraulic 

head at the grout curtain area, the upstream hydraulic head assumed in Equation 5.7 must not 

be defined by the reservoir level but by the hydraulic head downstream from the grout curtain. 

To confirm this hypothesis it is not only necessary to have the results of a 2D model of 

seepage in a vertical cross section of the foundation, but also to remember that, when using 

Equation 5.7, the distance from the drainage line to the grout curtain and not the distance from 

the drainage line to the upstream face of the dam must be considered. 

Results obtained with the model which is presented in the next chapter, in section 6.2, lead to 

the conclusion that: 

1) at elevation 48.5 m the hydraulic head downstream from the grout curtain is 62.5 m; 

2)  with Hu = 62.5 m and a distance from the drainage line to the grout curtain of 3.5 m 

(distance in the model at elevation 48.5 m), Sd is 13.3, therefore the average 

hydraulic head at the drainage line 61.8 m (13.3 + 48.5); 

3) the difference between numerical results is 0.6 % of the difference of hydraulic head 

between upstream and downstream.  

Table 5.19 shows the results obtained for the remaining considered elevations. The difference 

between numerical results and those obtained with the analytical solution suggested by 

Andrade assuming the hydraulic head downstream from the grout curtain is, with the 

exception of elevation 36.0 m, around 1 % of the difference in hydraulic head between 

upstream and downstream. At elevation 36.0 m the difference is 3.3 %. 

Results obtained confirm the theory that the hydraulic head downstream from the grout 

curtain must be used when determining the average hydraulic head at the line of the drains 

with Andrade’s analytical solution.  

The 3D model in which the hydraulic head is assumed on the rock mass surface upstream and 

downstream from the dam was run again with a distance between drains of 6.0 m. Results in 

Table 5.20 show that at elevation 48.5 m the difference between the hydraulic head 

determined with the numerical model and with the expression suggested by Andrade is 3.5 % 

of the difference in hydraulic head between upstream and downstream. The highest 

difference, of around 8.5 %, is at elevation 36.0 m.

When the drains are located 3.0 m apart, the variation in hydraulic head along the line of the 

drains is small and the results of the 3D model are very close to those obtained with 

Andrade’s solution, assuming, as previously mentioned, the hydraulic head downstream from 

the grout curtain. When the drains are located 6.0 m apart, the hydraulic head downstream 

from the grout curtain obtained with the 2D model of a vertical cross section of the dam 

foundation no longer corresponds to the average hydraulic head at the perpendicular direction, 

therefore there is a considerable difference between the results obtained with the 3D model 

and with the analytical solution. 

Results obtained lead to the conclusion that Andrade’s analytical solution, which can be 

quickly and easily applied, is very useful to estimate, at the planning stage, the variation in 

discharges at the drainage line when the spacing between drains is changed. 

5.4 Conclusions 

The study of dam hydraulic behaviour requires the use of relatively large meshes, where the 

modelling of drainage systems is simplified. From the numerical simulation of two simple 

flow cases, the influence of the mesh size and of different ways of modelling the drains was 

assessed. Comparisons with analytical solutions showed the good performance of both the 

FLAC and 3DEC models. 

The study carried out led to the conclusion that if a drain with a diameter of 0.076 m is 

modelled by its axis the dimension of the elements in the vicinity of the drain should not be 

lower than 0.27 m. It is worth noting that the drain is modelled by its axis to allow the use of a 

coarser mesh, in order to reduce run times.  

The study of the hydraulic behaviour of a concrete dam foundation with 3D models led to the 

following main conclusions: 

1. In 3D models, as in 2D models, when the drain is modelled by its axis the mesh in the 

vicinity of the drain must not be too fine. The most suitable size of the elements in the 

vicinity of the drain is about 3.5 times the drain diameter. 

2. In the study of the hydraulic behaviour of dam foundations it is adequate to consider 

the hydraulic head on the rock mass surface, upstream and downstream from the dam, 

and assume to be impervious the lateral surfaces, the bottom surface and the 

dam/foundation interface. 

3. Decreasing grout curtain permeability leads to a considerable decrease in the water 

flow through the model and in the discharges coming to the drain, but has little 

influence on the hydraulic head values. 



 201 

4. The artificial boundaries that define the model limits must be far away from the area 

of interest, so that its definition has no influence on the results. However it should be 

noted that in 3D models the increase in the model dimensions leads to a great increase 

in the number of the system degrees of freedom and, consequently, an increase in run 

times. 

5. In the studied case, the widening of the mesh to another with about 20 % of the 

number of elements and 26 % of the number of grid points of the initial mesh, has 

little influence on the value of the discharges into the drains, and reduces run times by 

about 90 %. 

6. In a three dimensional model, when there is a drainage curtain with drains with a 

diameter of 76 mm located 3.0 m apart, the total discharge at the drainage curtain is 

94 % of the total discharge at the equivalent trench. If the spacing between drains is 

6.0 m, the total discharge at the drainage curtain is 84 % of the total discharge. 

7. If the drainage curtain is modelled by an hypothetical continuous trench with the same 

depth as the drains where the average value of the hydraulic head at the line of the 

drains is assumed, the total discharge at the trench is almost the same as the total 

discharge in a 3D model, and 5.0 m away from the line of the drains the difference in 

the piezometric heads is less than 1 %.  

This last conclusion is particularly significant in global 3D models of the foundation where it 

is not possible to model each one of the drains. 

Conclusions drawn from the study presented in this chapter were taken into account whilst 

developing each one of the different models presented in the following two chapters. In both, 

the study of dam foundation hydraulic behaviour starts with two-dimensional models, which 

are especially useful as they are very simple and can be employed if the dam geometry does 

not vary in the perpendicular direction and if it can be assumed that the flow takes place at the 

plane of the model. However, the flow in fractured rock masses is mainly three-dimensional 

and in site-specific studies 3D models provide a more realistic approach to the flow 

simulations.

6 Analysis of seepage in Alqueva dam foundation 

6.1 Introduction 

Comprehensive numerical analysis of seepage in Alqueva dam foundation is presented in this 

chapter. The study consisted in the development of a series of numerical models, which were 

progressively validated and calibrated against field data. The first to be developed was a 

simplified two-dimensional model of a vertical cross section, based on the hypothesis of an 

equivalent continuum medium. Although Alqueva dam is an arch dam, both structural and 

valley shapes and dimensions allow, as an initial approach, the analysis of seepage along a 

cross section at the bottom of the valley using a two dimensional model. This model was 

developed before carrying out experimental activities and therefore conclusions drawn from 

in situ tests reported in chapter 4.5 were not taken into account.  

In the analysis of the hydraulic behaviour of concrete dam foundations, 2D models of vertical 

cross sections are useful, as they are very simple and can be used if the dam geometry is 

consistent along its length and if it is assumed that the flow takes place at the plane of the 

model. However, to study seepage in more detail three-dimensional models must be used. 

Taking into account the conclusions of the previous chapter, two different 3D models of the 

foundation of Alqueva dam were developed: the first was a detailed 3D model of a part of the 

foundation, in which each one of the drains is modelled; the second, a global model, in which 

the drainage system is simulated in a simplified way. The detailed model was developed for 

the analysis of the tests data. Modelling each one of the drains in 3D models of dam 

foundations leads to excessively fine meshes, which are very difficult to use. However, they 

are extremely useful in the analysis of seepage in specific areas, which involves relatively 

small foundation volumes and a low number of drains are modelled. The development of 

detailed models for seepage analysis in two site-specific areas of the foundation is described 

and the results are presented and analysed. A parameter study was carried out to identify 

which of the parameters have the greatest influence on the numerical discharges and hydraulic 

heads. 

Test results and the knowledge gained with the detailed models were used to develop a much 

more simplified global hydraulic model of the dam foundation, a scale of representation 

which is significant for safety assessment studies. In this model, the drainage system is 

simulated in a simplified way, by a hypothetical continuous trench with the same depth as the 

drains. Comparisons between numerical discharges, calculated with this global model, and 

recorded discharges led to the conclusion that the apertures of the discontinuities through 

which water flows vary with changes in reservoir level. Therefore, based on the results of 



   204 

borehole water-inflow tests, presented in chapter 4.5, and on available field data, an attempt 

was made to estimate the correlation between stress and permeability in some areas of the 

dam foundation. 

In the last part of the chapter, a numerical study on the significance of readings taken in 

piezometers is presented. In a chapter on numerical modelling of seepage in Alqueva dam 

foundation, this section may seem out of place. However, the study was carried out using the 

dimensions of Alqueva dam as reference, with a 3D model based on the detailed 3D models 

developed for the analysis of the test results. 

6.2 Two-dimensional model of a vertical cross section at the bottom of the 
valley 

6.2.1 Model description 

The 2D model presented in this section was developed prior to water-inflow testing, only as a 

preliminary approach to the analysis of seepage in the dam foundation at the bottom of the 

valley (Farinha and Lemos 2006). The analysis was carried out with FLAC 4.0 (Itasca 2002). 

In two-dimensional models, the modelling of the drainage curtain is equivalent to a 

hypothetical trench in the perpendicular direction of the section being studied. Therefore, the 

numerical value of the discharges in the drains is greater than in reality. 

The model is about 1000 × 500 m
2
 and the boundaries are quite a way from the dam’s area of 

influence, encompassing about 480 m of foundation upstream from the dam, the areas below 

the dam’s central block, the powerhouse slab and the downstream dam-wall, and about 390 m 

downstream from this wall. The model is 500 m deep (Figure 6.1). Although the majority of 

the flow takes place through the foundation discontinuities it is assumed that joint spacing is 

small compared to the size of the rock mass being studied and that joint orientation is fairly 

random. Thus, the hydraulic properties of an equivalent continuum are considered. It is 

assumed that water flows according to Darcy’s law, in a homogeneous and isotropic media.   

The mesh was designed to be finer close to the drains and for no zone to have a length more 

than 10 times its width. The mesh is composed of 3596 zones. Both grout curtains, below the 

central cantilever and below the downstream dam-wall, which are about 44.0 m and 9.0 m 

deep, respectively, are simulated by a band of elements 1 m wide. The drains and piezometers 

are modelled at the same position and with the same length as the holes drilled in the 

foundation (Figure 6.2). 

The mesh has three areas with different hydraulic conductivities. Taking into account the 

results of water pressure permeability tests performed in vertical boreholes where geophysical 

tests were also carried out, it was first assumed that the hydraulic conductivity was 



 205 

2.0 × 10
-7

 m/s above elevation 48.0 m and 1.0 × 10
-7

 m/s below (Farinha and Lemos 2006; 

LNEC 2005b). After more detailed analysis of the test results, which are shown in Table 6.1, 

it was assumed that in the foundation of the dam’s central block (block 13-14), the hydraulic 

conductivity was 1.0 × 10
-7

 m/s above elevation 48.0 m and 0.5 × 10
-7

 m/s below (Farinha et 

al. 2006).  It was assumed that the grout curtains’ hydraulic conductivity was 200 times lower 

than the hydraulic conductivity of the foundation’s most pervious area. 

6.2.2 Hydraulic boundary conditions and numerical results 

For boundary conditions the following water pressures were assumed: i) corresponding to the 

water heights in the areas in contact with the Alqueva and Pedrógão reservoirs, including the 

upstream slope of the insertion of the dam in the foundation; ii) zero at drain heads; 

iii) corresponding to the distance from the drain head to the considered level, along the 

drainage boreholes. The remaining boundaries are assumed to be impervious. Figure 6.2 

shows a detail of the numerical model below the dam, powerhouse slab and downstream dam 

wall. 

The monitoring results on different dates were compared with numerical results (Farinha et al. 

2006). Table 6.2 shows the average values of the recorded discharges in the foundation of the 

dam’s central blocks and the corresponding numerical results on the date of the second stage 

of the water level during the controlled first filling of the reservoir, at elevation 143.0 m (in 

which the water pressure was 82 % of the water pressure that is going to be reached at the 

retention water level) and on the two dates when, up to the end of 2005, the highest levels 

upstream and downstream from the dam were reached.

The analysis of the values shown in Table 6.2 led to the conclusion that the numerical 

discharges were of the same order as the recorded discharges, although in the dam the 

differences were greater than 45 % for the reservoir lower levels. These differences were 

assumed to be due to the fact that the same values of permeability were used in the different 

numerical experiments, not taking into account variations in permeability with the state of 

stress in the foundation. 

Figure 6.3 shows the hydraulic head contours in the foundation considering the water levels 

recorded on 2005.11.29 and Figure 6.4 shows, for the same date, seepage velocity in the 

foundation. The variations in the hydraulic head along the line where the piezometers are 

positioned, with the length defined at the design stage at the base of the central cantilever are 

presented in Figure 6.5 (PZB 17-1, 2 and 3). It should be noted that piezometric boreholes are 

shorter than defined in the design stage, as shown in Figure 4.16. On the date in question, the 

hydraulic heads recorded in the foundation of the dam’s central area, in piezometer PZB-2, 

varied from 62.0 m to 74.0 m, with an average value of 67.2 m. The piezometers installed in 

Alqueva dam foundation are boreholes closed with a pressure gauge at their heads, and thus 

the hydraulic head is the same along these boreholes. In the 2D model presented, however, in 

contrast to what was done in the 3D models that are presented in the following sections, the 

hydraulic head was not constrained to be an unknown constant along each borehole’s length 

and so the lines in Figure 6.5 show the variations in piezometric head along the line where the 

boreholes are positioned, as if they had not been drilled.  

It was decided that the grout curtains’ assumed hydraulic conductivity of 200 times lower 

than that of the foundation most pervious area was not appropriate and so new numerical 

analysis was carried out with a hydraulic conductivity 10 and 20 times lower. In the former 

case, to match the observed discharges at the dam for the reservoir higher levels, maintaining 

the ratio between permeability values of the two foundation zones, a rock mass hydraulic 

conductivity of 3.7 × 10
-8

 m/s above elevation 48.0 m and 1.85 × 10
-8

 m/s below would be 

needed. In the latter case, a rock mass hydraulic conductivity of 4.5 × 10
-8

 m/s above 

elevation 48.0 m and 2.25 × 10
-8

 m/s below would be needed. However, in both cases the 

numerical discharges at the dam-wall are about half of the recorded values. Table 6.3 shows a 

comparison of recorded and numerical discharges on the same dates as in Table 6.2. Figures 

6.6 to 6.8 and 6.9 to 6.11 are similar to Figure 6.3, 6.4 and 6.5 but with the new numerical 

results.

The 2D model presented here was developed at a preliminary stage of the study so as to 

approximately simulate seepage flow in the valley bottom, and therefore no further model 

improvement was attempted in order to obtain numerical discharges closer to those recorded. 

In a 3D model it would be necessary to simulate the variation in discharges and water 

pressures from each dam block to another. A 2D “average” model, like that presented here, 

can only give a rough idea of flow.

6.2.3 Influence of the boundary distances used in the numerical model 

The distance at which boundaries should be placed from the area being studied when 

analysing the hydraulic behaviour of vertical cross sections of dam foundations was assessed 

using the model previously presented, with two simplifying assumptions: i) the downstream 

dam wall was not considered, in order to carry out the study assuming only one grout curtain 

and one drainage curtain; and ii) the same hydraulic conductivity was assumed in the whole 

foundation rock mass (2.0 × 10
-7

 m/s). 

The study was carried out with five different meshes (m1 to m5) with the boundaries 

successively further away from the dam. As the dam is 96.0 m high and the system 

dam/powerhouse creates an impervious boundary of about 140 m at the concrete/rock mass 

interface in the upstream-downstream direction, a reference distance L of 140.0 m is assumed. 

Figure 6.12 shows the different meshes used. 

Tables 3.6 and 3.7 show the numerical results with the water level in the reservoir at an 

elevation of 152.0 m and the water downstream from the dam at an elevation of 80.0 m, 

assuming the foundation to be drained and not drained, respectively. Results analysis leads to 

the following conclusions:  

i) when drained foundations are considered, meshes larger than four times the 

reference distance in the horizontal direction and two times in the vertical direction 

give very close results (differences in drain discharges less than 2.5 %); 

ii) when the foundation is not drained, the quantity of water flowing through the 

model when the mesh is about 4 and 3 times the reference distance (in the 

horizontal and vertical directions, respectively), is 55 % of that obtained with a 

model with a size of about 14 and 7 times the reference distance. 

Therefore, when most of the water flows between the reservoir and the drainage curtain it is 

enough to consider distances from the dam area to boundaries of about those considered in 

model m2. When there is a significant quantity of water reaching the downstream boundaries, 

the model boundaries should be further away from the dam’s area.

6.3 Detailed three-dimensional model of a local area 

6.3.1 Model description 

A detailed three-dimensional model was developed to carry out more in-depth analysis in 

specific areas of the foundation. The model is formed by a series of adjacent vertical strips, 

which extend from about 50.0 m upstream from the upstream face of the dam to 50.0 m 

downstream from the downstream dam-wall. The model, which can be limited to a specific 

area, is formed by a group of strips with two different widths: the inner strips are 3.0 m wide, 

the distance between drains, and, due to symmetry, the outer strips are 1.5 m wide, 

corresponding to half the distance between drains. Each strip has a vertical length of 78.0 m, 

which is around two times the projection of the grout curtain in the vertical direction. The 

cross section of the dam in the valley bottom, from the upstream face of the dam to the 

downstream face of the downstream dam-wall, measures from around 115 m, in the lateral 

areas, to around 140 m, in the central cross section, thus the average value of 130.0 m was 



   216 

assumed. The model of a single strip has a volume of 230.0 × 78.0 × 3.0 m
3
 or 

230.0 × 78.0 × 1.5 m
3
. The modelling of each strip takes into account both the horizontal and 

vertical curvatures of the dam where it meets the foundation. Each one of these strips is 

divided into blocks, which are internally divided into tetrahedra. 

Figure 6.13 shows the position of the foundation model in the area where the bottom of the 

valley meets the right hand side abutment. This model includes three drains and is formed by 

two inner strips 3.0 m wide and two outer strips 1.5 m wide, thus being only 9.0 m wide. 

It is assumed that the grout curtain, which crosses the whole model width, is 1 m thick. The 

drain is modelled by its axis (diameter zero) and is positioned at the inner strip boundary, in 

strips 1.5 m wide, and at both strip boundaries, in strips 3.0 m wide. Each one of the 1.5 m 

wide strips is divided into 25 blocks, and each of the 3.0 m wide strips into 27 blocks, the 

difference being in the number of blocks in the vicinity of the drains, in the drainage curtain 

direction. 

The relative position of the grout and drainage curtains is respected. The grout curtain dips 

20° towards upstream, is located about 7.0 m downstream from the upstream face and is 41 m 

long. The drainage curtain is located about 0.5 m downstream from the grout curtain and dips 

5° towards upstream but it was assumed to be vertical, in order to simplify the model.  

The mesh is finer close to the drains and along the drains’ whole length and was defined by 

the average edge length of the tetrahedral zones. For the 1.5 m wide strips a different number 

of zones was assumed in different locations: 4 zones across strips’ width in the vicinity of the 

drains; 2 zones in the blocks surrounding the area in the vicinity of the drains; and only 1 zone 

in the remaining domain. The average dimension of the tetrahedron edges closer to the drain 

is 0.30 m. Each strip has 127386 tetrahedra and 37695 grid points. In the 3.0 m wide strips the 

number of zones across the width doubles. Figure 6.14 shows the division into blocks and 

internal mesh of a 1.5 m wide strip, as well as the position of the grout curtain and the drain, 

of which the depth is about half of the grout curtain’s length and, in the mesh, ends 3 m above 

the horizontal joint. 

The main weakness of this model is the assumption that, in the area being studied, water flow 

takes place in the upstream-downstream direction, parallel to the main river channel.  

In order to simplify the definition of different areas’ material properties, rock mass and grout 

curtain were defined as separate regions. The blocks adjacent to the reservoir and to the 

downstream area, where the tailwater pressure is assumed, were also defined as different 

regions, to make it easier to define hydraulic boundary conditions. Figure 6.15 shows the 

model’s four different regions. 



 217 

In the analysis presented in this section it is assumed that the rock mass foundation is 

homogeneous and isotropic with a permeability of 1.0 × 10
-7

 m/s and that the grout curtain is 

100 times less pervious. As noted before, such a low ratio between the permeability of the 

grout curtain and that of the rock mass is not considered appropriate. This is modified in the 

following section.

6.3.2 Hydraulic boundary conditions and numerical results  

Numerical analysis was carried out assuming the reservoir at an elevation of 143.0 m and the 

water downstream from the dam-wall at an elevation of 75.0 m. The concrete/rock mass 

interface and the bottom and lateral boundaries were assumed to be impervious. A zero 

pressure was assumed at the drains’ head. 

Seepage analysis was first carried out using a single strip 1.5 m wide, in an area of the 

foundation with a width corresponding to half the distance between drains. With this model, 

the numerical discharges are (the negative value means that water flows into the model):

reason why the quantity of water flowing into and out of the model does not sum up is 

explained in section 6.3.4.  

The hydraulic head contours are presented in Figure 6.16 . 

6.3.3 Influence of mesh size 

In order to reduce run times, two other meshes were defined which are similar to the fine 

mesh shown in Figure 6.14 but with larger elements. In the second mesh, called coarse mesh, 

the average edge length of the tetrahedral zones close to the drain remains 0.30 m but it 

doubles in the other blocks. The third mesh, called very coarse mesh, differs in the average 

edge length of the zones close to the drain, which is 0.60 m.  The second mesh has 27012 

tetrahedra with 10297 grid points, which are about 21 % of the total elements and 27 % of the 

grid points of the initial model and the third mesh has 21947 tetrahedra with 8394 grid points, 

which are about 17 % of the total elements and 22 % of the grid points of the initial model. 

Figure 6.17 shows mesh details at the drain’s upper and lower areas for both fine and very 

coarse meshes.

   220 

The numerical discharges obtained with each model are presented in Table 6.6. It is possible 

to conclude that drain discharges using the coarse and very coarse mesh are just 1.8 % and 

3.4 % respectively greater than those obtained with the fine mesh. 

In the fine mesh, convergence in steady state conditions is achieved in about 3.0 × 10
5
 steps, 

which takes about 8 and a quarter hours. With the coarse mesh, convergence is achieved in 

about 1.5 × 10
5
 steps, which takes 54 minutes and with the very coarse mesh in about 

1.0 × 10
5
 steps, which takes just 30 minutes. Run times presented (Table 6.7) were obtained in 

numerical analyses conducted with a single strip 1.5 m wide. If the model includes more 

strips, run times increase accordingly. 

Variations in hydraulic head along horizontal lines 40 m long in various sections of two 

planes perpendicular to the line of drains were compared. The first plane crosses the drain and 

the other is 1.5 m away from the drain, midway between drains. Five horizontal lines were 

considered in each plane, positioned at the top, the middle and the bottom of the drain, and 

1 m and 5 m below the bottom of the drain. Comparison of results obtained with the fine and 

the very coarse mesh (Figure 6.18) led to the conclusion that with the exception of the areas 

inside the grout curtain and around the drain, differences in hydraulic head along the lines are 

less than 2.6 %. Inside the grout curtain, differences reach about 17 % (because the very 

coarse mesh has only one element across the grout curtain’s thickness, while the fine mesh 

has two), but in the vicinity of the drain, differences in the hydraulic head are less than 4 %.  

In the case studied, the widening of initial mesh elements to create another with about 17 % of 

the number of elements and 22 % of the number of grid points, has little influence on the 

value of the discharges and on the hydraulic heads, and reduces run times by about 90 %. 

Therefore, the very coarse mesh, shown in Figure 6.17 and in Figure 6.19, was used in the 

subsequent analyses.

6.3.4 Use of single/double precision version  

The numerical results presented in the previous sub-chapter show that there is a difference of 

between 0.04 m
3
/s and 0.08 m

3
/s in the quantity of water flowing into and out of the model. 

Numerical analysis was carried out with the single-precision version, but 3DEC includes a 

separate executable code written entirely in double-precision. This version is useful in models 

where critical information is lost because of the dimension of the models, such as fluid flow 

models where more than 1,000,000 cycles may be executed, but requires three times the 

amount of memory required by the single-precision version (Itasca 2003). To confirm that the 

difference between inflow and outflow values was due to the use of the single-precision 

version, numerical experiments were carried out with the double-precision version. Table 6.8 

shows a comparison of the numerical value of the discharges with both versions.  

Analysis of results shows that when the double-precision version is used the quantity of flow 

into and out of the blocks is almost the same. The single-precision code is rounded off to six 

decimal places. The value of the unbalanced flow is around 10
-11

, therefore, in practice, the 

numerical value of the discharge is not altered in each step (it is like adding zero). In the 

double-precision version, rounded off to 20 decimal places, the solution converges and the 

value of the out-of-balance flow is around 10
-19

. Differences in numerical discharges obtained 

with single and double-precision versions are less than 0.4 % and run times are significantly 

less when single-precision is used (Table 6.9), because of the smaller number of steps 

necessary to reach convergence. Therefore single-precision was used in subsequent numerical 

analysis.

6.4 Numerical modelling of borehole water-inflow tests 

6.4.1 Introduction 

In this section, the development of detailed 3D numerical models for seepage analysis in two 

site-specific areas of the foundation is described and the results are presented and analysed. 

Borehole water-inflow tests carried out in drains D20 D and D25 D are simulated using 

models 9 m wide which include the drain tested and the two adjacent drains.  

As mentioned in Chapter 4 (section 4.5), borehole water-inflow tests were carried out in the 

area of the valley bottom where the highest discharges are recorded, where the bottom of the 

valley meets the right hand side abutment. Figure 6.20 shows where water flows into each 

borehole located in the vicinity of drains D20 D and D25 D, identified with both water 

electrical conductivity analysis and borehole water-inflow tests.

As previously mentioned, in borehole water-inflow tests, fixed test intervals are considered 

and isolated and the boreholes are tested in consecutive sections throughout their lengths. For 

each test interval, flow rates and water pressures in the hole being tested and in the nearby 

boreholes are recorded until steady state conditions are achieved. In this study closed 

boreholes are simulated by constraining the hydraulic head to be an unknown constant along 

each borehole’s length, at the same time not allowing water to flow out of the hole. Closed 

borehole intervals, either with single or double packers, are simulated in the same way, this 

time allowing discharges above the single packer, or above the upper packer whenever a 

double packer is used. Areas where flow paths cross the drains are modelled by bands of 

elements of higher permeability. With the current 3DEC code it is not possible to display 

neither these bands of elements, nor areas inside one or more than one model block with a 

different permeability, therefore three-dimensional AUTOCAD drawings were made which 

allow the presentation of the various models’ assumed hypotheses. Figure 6.21 shows a 3D 

perspective of a part of the 9 m wide foundation model in relation to the dam, in which the 

three drains included in the model are shown in red and the grout curtain, located upstream 

from the drains, is shown in dark gray.    

6.4.2 Numerical modelling of tests carried out in drain D25 D 

6.4.2.1 Introduction 

Tests carried out in drain D25 D led to the conclusion that water flowed into the borehole in 

the top 10 m and that 90 % of the water flowed into the borehole at between 4.0 to 7.0 m 

down from the drain head. As shown in Figure 6.20 water inflow in drain D26 D was only 

observed at between 4.0 and 5.0 m down from the drain head, and drain D24 D was 

obstructed 0.65 m below concrete/rock mass interface. To simulate tests carried out in drain 

D25 D, where only a single area where water flowed into the borehole was observed, it was 

necessary to develop a model which could simulate two different situations (Figure 6.22): 

- normal operating conditions;  

- drain D25 D closed. 

In situ results on two different dates had been recorded with differences in the water level in 

the reservoir of 6.5 m. Table 6.10 shows the observed discharges and water pressures of both 

situations on the two different dates. Results presented reveal that the raising of the reservoir 

from elevation 143.6 m up to elevation 150.0 m leads to a slight increase in flow rates (8.5 % 

up to 19 %). On both dates, when drain D25 D is closed water pressures of about 5.0 bar are 

reached, which correspond to almost 60 % of the hydraulic head.

6.4.2.2 Hydraulic boundary conditions 

The first numerical analysis, presented in section 6.2, was carried out assuming the reservoir 

at an elevation of 143.0 m and the water downstream from the dam-wall at an elevation of 

75.0 m. A zero pressure was assumed at the drains’ head. These boundary conditions are 

adequate in a global seepage model of the foundation. However, for a detailed analysis of 

seepage in a restricted area, the downstream boundary condition is not appropriate, as the 

grout and drainage curtains drilled from the downstream dam-wall change seepage flow in the 

upstream-downstream direction. Therefore, the following numerical analysis was carried out 

assuming the hydraulic head recorded at the piezometers installed at the substation slab, at the 

toe of the dam. From 16-20 October 2006, with the reservoir at an elevation around 143.6 m, 

and from 19-23 March 2007, with the water level around 150.0 m, average hydraulic heads of 

69.9 m and 70.3 m were recorded at the mentioned piezometers. A hydraulic head of 70.0 m 

was assumed on both dates. With these boundary conditions, the model could have been 

shortened downstream from the dam, in order to reduce run times, but it was decided to 

maintain it. 

6.4.2.3 Numerical experiments 

The detailed 3D model to simulate tests carried out in drain D25 D was developed in various 

steps with progressive enhancements, shown in Figure 6.23. In each one of these steps the two 

situations to be simulated were taken into account and the different parameters were adjusted 

in order to make the numerical results correspond more closely to the observed discharges and 

water pressures, shown in Table 6.11. It is assumed that the rock mass foundation is 

homogeneous and isotropic and that the grout curtain is 10 times less pervious than the rock 

mass. 

Firstly, a homogeneous and isotropic media was assumed and the rock mass permeability 

necessary to obtain the average value of the discharges in drain D25 D’s area of influence was 

determined (Figure 6.23 - Step 1). Secondly, a near-surface area of higher permeability 

upstream from the dam was considered, in order to simulate the assumed existence of vertical 

fissures within the rock mass close to the heel of the dam (Figure 6.23 - Step 2). These 

fissures are opened by the development of tensile stresses in this area, due to the filling of the 

reservoir. Thirdly, a horizontal layer of higher permeability between the upstream area and the 

drains was considered. This layer crosses the grout curtain, simulating a probable area of the 

foundation where the total sealing of discontinuities with very small apertures was not 

achieved (gap in the grout curtain). It was first assumed that this layer of higher permeability 

was 3.0 m deep and crossed the whole model’s width (Figure 6.23 – Step 3) but the layer 

width was then gradually changed, in order for numerical values to correspond to recorded 

discharges and water pressures (Figure 6.23 – Steps 4 and 5). Finally two different layers 



 229 

were modelled upstream from drains D25 D and D26 D; both layers are 3.0 m deep but the 

layer at D26 D is 2.0 m higher to take into account the point at which discontinuities cross 

each one of the drains (Figure 6.23 – Step 6). With this final change numerical results were 

closer to observed values.

with a width equal to half the 

distance between drains, close to 

drain D25 D, upstream from drain

distance between drains, close 

to drain D25 D, upstream 

from drain D26 D. 

The layer at drain D26 D is 2.0 m 

higher.

During the model’s development the first numerical experiments were carried out with a 

single strip 1.5 m wide and with a drain 25 m long. In order to avoid errors, an auxiliary 

model was also used, similar to that described in the previous section (section 6.3) but in 

which the parallel vertical foundation strips are positioned in such a way as to build a brick 

shape 9 m wide. Each drain is 25 m long and the same hydraulic head is assumed in the 

model’s three drains. The model described in section 6.3, which takes into account both the 

horizontal and vertical curvatures of the dam where it meets the foundation, was used as a 

basis for the development of the seepage model in the vicinity of drain D25 D. In this latter 

model, the hydraulic head in each drain is the same as the drain head’s elevation. The drains 

were first assumed to be 25 m long, in order to compare numerical results with those obtained 

with the auxiliary model. The drains’ real length was used once the model had been 

developed.  

Numerical experiments were carried out comparing the numerical results to the monitoring 

data collected in October 2006. A detailed description of results obtained in each modelling 

step is presented in the following paragraphs.  In order to make the comparison of observed 

and numerical discharges easier, results are shown in (l/min) or ((l/min)/m). 

First modelling step (Figure 6.23 - Step 1): a homogeneous and isotropic media was 

assumed. In a rock mass of uniform permeability k, the leakage varies linearly with k. 

Numerical analysis was carried out for two different hydraulic conductivity values: 

1.5 × 10
-8

 m/s and 5.0 × 10
-8

 m/s (Table 6.12). Taking into account these results and the linear 

relationship between discharges and hydraulic conductivity values, a rock mass hydraulic 

conductivity of  4.0 × 10
-8

 m/s was first assumed in order to match the average discharge 

observed in drain D25 D’s area of influence (0.23 (l/min)/m). As it had been observed that 

there is a seepage path crossing drain D25 D in its upper area, and the highest discharge is that 

observed in drain D25 D, it was later realised that rock mass permeability should be less than 

4.0 × 10
-8

 m/s. The average discharge recorded in drain D25 D’s area of influence, not 

including discharge in drain D25 D (0.12 (l/min)/m) would be achieved with a rock mass 

permeability of 2.0 × 10
-8

 m/s. However, the results of Lugeon type tests carried out while 



 231 

drilling boreholes D24 D and D26 D led to the conclusion that, in the boreholes’ vicinity the 

rock mass hydraulic conductivity was about 1.0 × 10
-8

 m/s (in drain D25 D rotary-percussive 

drilling was used; therefore no borehole log is available). A rock mass of 1.0 × 10
 -8

 m/s was 

afterwards assumed. The average discharge is 0.17 l/min, or 0.06 (l/min)/m, which is 26 % of 

the observed discharge. This homogeneous model does not take into account either the usual 

existence of vertical or sub-vertical fissures within the rock mass close to the heel of the dam 

or the seepage paths detected while carrying out the borehole water-inflow tests. 

Second modelling step (Figure 6.23 - Step 2): In a second modelling step, the existence of a 

near-surface area of higher permeability upstream from the dam was considered. It was 

assumed that this area’s hydraulic conductivity was 10.0 × 10
-7

 m/s and that it was 7.0 m deep 

and 5.0 m long in the upstream-downstream direction. Table 6.13 shows the numerical results 

obtained with the three different models described on the previous page. It can be seen that 

the three models lead to the same average discharge. The model that takes into account 

curvatures of the dam where it meets the foundation leads to different discharges in the three 

drains, because each drain head is at a different elevation. In this case, about 40 % of the total 

discharge flows out of the model through drain D24 D, about 36 % through drain D25 D and 

about 24 % through drain D26 D. With this area of higher permeability, the average discharge 

increases about 24 % (from 0.17 l/min up to 0.21 l/min). 

In a homogeneous and isotropic media the discharge per metre through a layer of height h is 

given by:

flow rate per unit width is thus expressed by the cubic law:

The average value of the fracture hydraulic aperture is determined equalling Equations 6.1

permeability upstream from the dam simulates a vertical discontinuity with a hydraulic 

aperture of 0.18 mm. 

Third modelling step (Figure 6.23 - Step 3): As previously mentioned, 90 % of the water 

flowed into drain D25 D at between 4.0 to 7.0 m down from the drain head. To take into 

account this observed seepage path, a horizontal layer of higher permeability between the 

upstream area and the drains was considered. This layer is 3.0 m deep, and crosses drain 

D25 D at between 4.0 to 7.0 m down from the drain head. Numerical experiments were 

carried out with different permeability values (Table 6.14). Taking into account these results, 

a horizontal layer’s hydraulic conductivity of 5.0 × 10
-7

 m/s was assumed, in order for the 

numerical discharge to correspond to that recorded in drain D25 D.

When the above-mentioned parameters are considered in the model that takes into account 

curvatures of the dam where it meets the foundation, the numerical discharges are: 

 

 Q upstream = - 5.21 l/min  Q drain D24 D = 2.61 l/min  

   Q drain D25 D = 1.89 l/min  

 Q downstream = 0.01 l/min  Q drain D26 D = 1.33 l/min  
  

Modelling steps 4 and 5 (Figure 6.23 - Steps 4 and 5): Numerical experiments were carried 

out with different layer widths, in order to make numerical results correspond to recorded 

discharges and water pressures. Two layer widths were considered: i) layer 3.0 m wide, 

upstream from drain D25 D; and ii) layer 4.5 m wide upstream from drain D25 D and with a 

width equal to half the distance between drains, close to drain D25 D, upstream from drain 

D26 D. In these modelling steps, numerical analysis was carried out not only with the three 

drains’ assumed length of 25.0 m but also considering their real length. Results are shown in 

Table 6.15. With these models, both discharges and water pressures at drains D25 D and 

D26 D are not significantly different from those recorded. However, this model does not 

simulate properly the depth at which water inflow to drain D26 D was observed.

the drains (model shown in Figure 6.23 - Steps 4 and 5 (that takes into account curvatures of 

the dam where it meets the foundation)). 

Modelling step 6 (Figure 6.23 - Step 6): Finally, as previously mentioned, two different 

layers were modelled, upstream from drains D25 D and D26 D; both layers are 3.0 m deep but 

the layer at D26 D is 2.0 m higher to take into account the point at which discontinuities cross 

each one of the drains. These layers simulate horizontal discontinuities with a hydraulic 

aperture of 0.12 mm. New numerical analysis was carried out assuming the water level in the 

reservoir and the hydraulic head recorded at the piezometers installed at the substation slab in 

March 2007. 

Figure 6.24 shows the parameter values used in the final model. Table 6.16 shows a 

comparison of recorded and numerical discharges and water pressures of both simulated 

situations on the two different dates (numerical results are shown in red). With this model, 

numerical discharges are about 8 % to 10 % higher than the recorded discharges and water 

pressures are about 6 % to 13 % lower, which can be considered sufficiently accurate. It can 

also be concluded that there is no change in the layers’ hydraulic aperture due to increase in 

the water level in the reservoir from elevation 143.6 m up to 150.0 m. 

Figure 6.25 shows the flow of water (l/min) entering each borehole water-inflow test interval, 

compared with the numerical results. The same figure shows a comparison of the recorded 

and the numerical accumulated discharge from the bottom to the borehole head. The drain’s 

recorded discharge in normal operating conditions (reference discharge) is shown in both 



 235 

graphs: in the first it allows the assessment of discharges in each test interval in relation to the 

drain’s total discharge; in the second it allows the comparison between accumulated and total 

discharge.

6.4.2.4 Effect of local surface topography 

The final model presented in the previous section takes into account the valley shape and the 

curvature of the dam where it meets the foundation. Drain D25 D is located in a particular 

area, where the bottom of the valley meets the right hand side abutment. In order to assess the 

effect of surface topography on water flow in the area between drain D25 D and the other two 

drains which are included in the model (D24 D on the valley floor and D26 D at the base of 

the slope), and study the distribution of discharges between the drains due to model geometry, 

a numerical experiment was carried out assuming that the hydraulic head in each one of the 

drains is the same as the drain’s head elevation, and neglecting the existence of water in the 

reservoir and in the area downstream from the dam. The medium was assumed to be 

homogeneous with a hydraulic conductivity of 1.0 × 10
-8

 m/s. The numerical experiments 

were carried out (Figure 6.27): i) assuming the three drains with a length of 25.0 m; and 

ii) considering the drains’ real length, assuming that drain D24 D is clogged from 6.75 m 

downwards. Numerical discharges are shown in Table 6.17. Results analysis reveals that: 

i) water flows into the model through drain D26 D and out of the model through the 

other two drains; 

ii) as expected, numerical discharges through the upstream and downstream areas are 

in practice zero, as they are four orders of magnitude smaller than drains’ 

numerical discharges; 

iii) when it is assumed that the three drains are 25.0 m long, about 42 % of the water 

flows out of the model through drain D24 D and about 58 % through drain D25 D; 

iv) when the drains’ real length is used, only about 10 % of the water flows out of the 

model through drain D24 D and about 90 % through drain D25 D.

6.4.3 Numerical modelling of tests carried out in drain D20 D 

6.4.3.1 Introduction 

Tests carried out in drain D20 D led to the conclusion that water flowed into the borehole in 

two distinct areas: at between 8.0 to 9.0 m and at between 4.0 to 6.0 m down from the drain 

head. As shown in Figure 6.20 water inflow in the adjacent drains, D19 D and D21 D, also 

occurred in an area very close to the concrete/rock mass interface: in drain D19 D both at the 

concrete/rock mass interface and at 6.5 to 7.5 down from the drain head, and in drain D21 D 

in the first 2.0 m down from the concrete/foundation interface. Test results led to the 

conclusion that, unlike the lower flow path crossing drain D20 D, the upper was linked to 

both the adjacent drains. The model developed for the analysis of the tests in drain D20 D, 

should be able to simulate four different situations (Figure 6.28): 

- normal operating conditions;  

- drain D20 D closed; 

- the single packer placed 7.0 m down from the drain head; and 

- the double packer placed in such a way that the test interval extended from 4.0 to 

7.0 m down from the drain head. 

Table 6.18 shows the observed discharges and water pressures in the four different situations 

recorded in the tests carried out in September 2007. The average discharges in drain D20 D’s 

area of influence, including and not including discharge in drain D20 D, were 0.07 and 

0.02 (l/min)/m, respectively. In March 2007, with the water level in the reservoir around 

150.0 m, the discharge in drain D20 D was 0.93 l/min and the water pressure when the drain 

was closed 1.20 bar, which corresponded to 13.6 % of the hydraulic head.

6.4.3.2 Hydraulic boundary conditions 

As in the numerical modelling of tests carried out in drain D25 D, the water level in the 

reservoir and the hydraulic head recorded at the piezometers installed at the substation slab 

were assumed as boundary conditions. From 3-7 September 2007, with the reservoir at an 

elevation around 148.0 m, an average hydraulic head of 72.7 m was recorded at the 

piezometers.  

6.4.3.3 Numerical experiments 

The detailed 3D model to simulate tests carried out in drain D20 D was developed in a similar 

way to that for drain D25 D. However, a greater number of numerical experiments had to be 

carried out, due to difficulties found during the model’s development. As previously, it is 

assumed that the rock mass foundation is homogeneous and isotropic and that the grout 

curtain is 10 times less pervious. 

Firstly, a homogeneous and isotropic media was assumed and the rock mass hydraulic 

conductivity necessary to obtain the average value of the discharges in drain D20 D’s area of 

influence, not including discharge in drain D20 D, was determined. In drain D20 D’s area of 

influence, discharges are very low, therefore a hydraulic conductivity of 1.5 × 10
-9

 m/s was 

first assumed. Lugeon type tests carried out while drilling drains D18 D and D20 D led to the 

conclusion that the hydraulic conductivity was almost zero in most of the test intervals. At 

drain D18 D’s upper section, in a length of 5.0 m down from concrete/rock mass interface and 

at drain D20 D’s lower area, permeability values of 1.0 × 10
-8

 m/s were recorded. 

Secondly, a near-surface area of higher permeability upstream from the dam was considered. 

This area is identical to the one considered in the model presented in the previous chapter, 

both in dimension and hydraulic conductivity. With this area of higher permeability, 

discharge increases about 22 % (from 0.027 l/min to 0.033 l/min). 

In the above-mentioned steps only the first test stage, simulating normal operating conditions, 

was modelled. 

Thirdly, a horizontal layer of higher permeability between the upstream area and drain D20 D 

was considered. This layer was located 8.0 to 9.0 m down from the drain head, in order to 

simulate the lower seepage path. Several numerical experiments were carried out in order to 

make results correspond to the observed discharges and water pressures, in normal operating 

conditions, with drain D20 D closed, and with the single packer placed 7.0 m down the from 

the drain head. It was observed that with the hydraulic conductivity necessary to achieve the 

recorded discharge in drain D20 D, the water pressure below the packer was much higher than 

that recorded. Numerical discharges in adjacent drains were lower than those recorded. 



 241 

To reduce water pressures, it was assumed that the top 5.0 m of the foundation rock mass 

were more pervious than the remaining domain. This upper area of higher hydraulic 

conductivity tried to simulate a more disturbed area, due to foundation excavation. The 

existence of this area would lead to greater discharges and, consequently, lower water 

pressures. Results were only slighted altered when the existence of this area was taken into 

account, thus it was decided not to make this change. 

In order to reduce water pressures, at the same time maintaining the numerical discharge in 

drain D20 D, the horizontal layer of higher permeability upstream from the drain was 

extended 35.0 m downstream to reach the substation. It was later realised that in the model 

this layer should be at least 2.0 m deep, to include all the zones. Due to great difficulties in 

making numerical discharges in drains D19 D and D21 D correspond to recorded discharges, 

it was decided to consider the average value of the discharges recorded in these two drains. In 

this case, advantage was taken of symmetry and therefore only one half of the domain width 

was taken into account in subsequent analysis. 

Another attempt was made to reduce water pressures, increasing the rock mass hydraulic 

conductivity at its lower depths. This would also lead to a greater discharge in adjacent drains. 

Numerical experiments were carried out with rock mass hydraulic conductivity values varying 

from 1.5 × 10
-9

 m/s up to 7.5 × 10
-9

 m/s. In each numerical experiment, the horizontal layer’s 

hydraulic conductivity had to be adjusted. 

The existence of the upper seepage path was afterwards simulated with a layer of higher 

permeability which extended from the upstream area to the substation. Once again, with the 

hydraulic conductivity values necessary to achieve the discharge distribution along drain 

D20 D, the numerical water pressures were much higher than those recorded. 

While carrying out borehole water-inflow tests in drain D20 D it was observed that there was 

a small quantity of water leaking from the floor of the downstream drainage gallery. When the 

borehole was closed the amount of water increased. The lower recorded water pressures could 

be due to this loss of water; therefore to simulate this leakage, an additional hydraulic 

boundary condition was considered: it was assumed that 14.0 m downstream from the drain, 

in a square with sides 4.0 m long, the hydraulic head on the model’s upper horizontal 

boundary was the same as the gallery floor elevation. 

Finally, the upper layer’s hydraulic conductivity downstream from the drain was increased. 

This change led to almost the same numerical discharges in drains and to lower water 

pressures. The layer’s lower hydraulic conductivity upstream from the drain simulates the 

presence of the grout curtain, which is probably partially inefficient in this area.    



   242 

Figure 6.29 shows the parameter values used in the final model. Table 6.19 shows a 

comparison of recorded and numerical discharges and water pressures in the four different 

situations (numerical results are shown in red). With this model, numerical discharges in drain 

D20 D are about 3 % to 15 % lower than the recorded discharges and the differences in 

hydraulic head are less than 8 %, which, as in the case of drain D25 D, can be considered 

sufficiently accurate. However, the model does not simulate properly the increase in 

discharges in the adjacent drains when drain D20 D is closed (modelling situations 2 and 4).  

Analysis of numerical discharges, shown in Table 6.20, reveals that in the four different 

situations about 68 % of the quantity of water that flows into the model comes from the 

reservoir and the remaining water from downstream. The leakage from the floor of the 

downstream drainage gallery plays a significant role in the model, as:

- in modelling situations 1 and 3, discharge in drain D20 D is very close to that lost 

through the leak; and  

- in modelling situations 2 and 4, the quantity of water flowing out of the model from 

the leakage is more than 80 % of the discharge coming into the model. 

However, these results do not correspond to what was observed, as, although there was no 

way of measuring, it was evident that the amount of discharge was very small, apparently less 

than 0.05 l/min. In this final model, the lower layer, with a hydraulic conductivity of 

4.3 × 10
-8

 m/s, simulates a horizontal discontinuity with a hydraulic aperture of only 0.05 mm. 

The upper layer, with an equivalent hydraulic conductivity of 5.41 × 10
-7

 m/s, simulates a 

layer with a hydraulic aperture of 0.11 mm. 

Figure 6.30 shows the discharge (l/min) entering each borehole water-inflow test interval, 

compared with the numerical results. The same figure shows a comparison of the recorded 

and the numerical accumulated discharge from the bottom to the borehole head. The drain’s 

recorded discharge in normal operating conditions (reference discharge) is also shown. Figure 

6.31 shows the parameter values of an alternative model, in which it is assumed that the grout 

curtain is partially inefficient in the area where it is crossed by the upper layer of higher 

hydraulic conductivity. Analysis of discharges and water pressures obtained with this model 

(Table 6.21) leads to the conclusion that results are only slightly different from those obtained 

with the model shown in Figure 6.29.

   246 

As noted during analysis of results obtained, this model does not properly simulate the 

increase in discharges in the adjacent drains when drain D20 D is closed (modelling situations 

2 and 4). In reality there are discontinuities linking the different drains which lead to flow 

between drains, not just through the rock mass. 

An additional weakness of this model is the excessive floor leakage, which in reality is only a 

very small amount, probably no greater than 0.05 l/min. This excess in the model can be 

explained by the larger quantity of water flowing from downstream. 

6.4.4 Conclusions 

A numerical simulation of borehole water-inflow tests carried out in two restricted foundation 

areas was carried out. Results of rock mass in situ permeability tests and areas where seepage 

paths cross each drain, identified with both borehole water-inflow tests and water electrical 

conductivity analysis, were taken into account. The analysis described in this section indicates 

that equivalent continuum models can be used successfully to model the hydraulic behaviour 

of specific areas of the foundation. The validity of the numerical models was assessed by 

comparing the numerical results to the readings taken while carrying out borehole water-

inflow tests (discharges and water pressures). 

Tests carried out in drain D25 D were easily simulated as there was only one area where water 

flowed into the borehole and therefore there were only two different situations to be taken into 

account. Tests carried out in drain D20 D led to the conclusion that seepage paths crossed the 

drain at two different elevations, which led to a far more complex model, as the number of 

parameters increased and there were more situations to be simulated with the same model. 

Models were validated against data collected in situ. During model development, parameters 

were continually adjusted as necessary. Back-analysis techniques are sometimes used to 

determine unknown or ill-known physical parameters (e.g. Castro 1997); however, in this 

case, even with the low number of parameters considered in each model, this would have 

presented significant difficulties, namely due to the excessive run-times required. Therefore, 

during the model’s development, a trial-and-error estimating procedure was carried out to 

continually adjust parameters. 

In the following section the influence of the different parameters on numerical results is 

analysed. As will be shown in section 6.6, parameters determined using detailed numerical 

models can not be used directly in a global 3D model of the dam foundation. In fact, in this 

type of models, only average measurements can be simulated. 

 



 247 

6.5 Parameter studies 

6.5.1 Introduction 

This section describes the parametric studies carried out to identify which of the parameters in 

the model developed to simulate seepage in drain D25 D’s vicinity, presented in section 6.4.2, 

have the greatest influence on the numerical discharges and hydraulic heads. A series of 

numerical experiments was performed by varying the value of one parameter while the other 

parameters were kept constant. Analysis was carried out to investigate the effect of:  

i) rock mass permeability;  

ii) grout curtain permeability;  

iii) higher rock mass permeability upstream from the dam; 

iv) permeability of horizontal layers upstream from the drains; and  

v) width of higher permeability layers upstream from the drains.  

The influence of total or partial clogging of drain D24 D was also investigated. 

6.5.2 Influence of rock mass permeability 

To assess the influence of rock mass permeability, a comparison was made between the 

numerical discharges and the numerical water pressure at drain D25 D when closed, with the 

rock mass permeability varying from 1.0 × 10
-9

 m/s up to 10 × 10
-7

 m/s. Results in each of the 

cases studied can be found in Table 6.22 and Figure 6.32, in which numerical results obtained 

with the model for drain D25 D (“reference values”) are highlighted. 

Analysis of Figure 6.32 leads to the conclusion that discharges in drains increase 

approximately in a linear way with an increase in rock mass permeability. In normal operating 

conditions the greatest discharge increase occurs in drain D25 D. Drain D24 D is clogged 

0.65 m below concrete/rock mass interface, therefore the rate of increase is smaller.  

In the model for drain D25 D it is assumed that there is a near-surface area of higher 

permeability upstream from the dam and two horizontal layers of higher permeability between 

the upstream area and drains D25 D and D26 D. Having this model in mind, if the rock mass 

were impervious and drain D25 D were closed, the hydraulic head at drain D25 D would be 

the same as that of the reservoir. As rock mass permeability increases, there is a simultaneous 

increase in discharges and decrease in the hydraulic head at drain D25 D.

Results presented show that lowering rock mass equivalent permeability does not 

significantly alter either discharges or water pressures; but an increase has much more 

influence, leading to greater discharges and to a sudden loss of water pressure. It also leads to 

larger quantities of water flowing into the drains at their lower areas, which is not realistic. 

6.5.3 Influence of grout curtain permeability 

To assess the influence of grout curtain permeability, calculations were carried with the grout 

curtain 1000, 100, 10 and 2 times less pervious than the rock mass and with the grout curtain 

as pervious as the rock mass. In practice, the former is equivalent to simulating an impervious 

grout curtain; therefore these values encompass the range from an impervious to a non-

existent grout curtain. Results are shown in Table 6.23 and Figure 6.33. 

Analysis of Figure 6.33 leads to the conclusion that changing grout curtain permeability has 

little influence on both discharges and water pressure at drain D25 D’s head, when the drain is 

closed. Preliminary studies of three-dimensional hydraulic foundation models, presented in 

chapter 5.3, led to the conclusion that decreasing grout curtain permeability leads to a 

considerable decrease in the water flow through the model and in the discharges coming to the 

drain, but has little influence on the hydraulic head values. In the model being studied, both 

horizontal layers of higher permeability upstream from drains D25 D and D26 D cross the 

grout curtain, therefore the amount of leakage and hydraulic heads are only slightly affected 

by the grout curtain permeability.

6.5.4 Influence of higher rock mass permeability upstream from the dam 

To study the influence of higher rock mass permeability upstream from the dam numerical 

analysis was carried out by varying permeability in that area from 0.1 × 10
-7

 m/s (actual rock 

mass permeability) up to 20 × 10
-7

 m/s. Results are shown in Table 6.24 and Figure 6.34. 

Results show that when the hydraulic conductivity of the area of higher permeability increases 

(doubles from 10 × 10
-7

 m/s to 20 × 10
-7

 m/s) there is only a slight increase both in drain 

discharges and water pressure when drain D25 D is closed. In the model being studied, it has 

been concluded that the majority of the water flows towards the drains first through the area 

of higher permeability upstream from the dam and then through the layers of higher 

permeability upstream from the drains. Therefore, flow is governed by an equivalent 

hydraulic conductivity.  

In estimating an equivalent vertical hydraulic conductivity of a layered aquifer L m deep it is 

assumed that the vertical velocity remains constant, thus the head loss across each layer is 

inversely proportional to the hydraulic conductivity (the layers are horizontal and water flows 

in a vertical downwards direction). The equivalent hydraulic conductivity is given by:

Where li is the vertical length of each layer and ki is the hydraulic conductivity of each layer. 

Analysis of Equation 6.3 leads to the conclusion that if the hydraulic conductivity of one of 

the layers is greatly increased, there may be almost no change in the equivalent hydraulic 

conductivity, as on the equation’s right hand side, depending on the relative values of the 

various ki, it may be like adding zero. Therefore, increasing a ki beyond some value has 

limited effect. 

When the permeability of the near-surface area of higher permeability upstream from the dam 

decreases, there is a decrease in both discharges in drains D25 D and D26 D and in the water 

pressure at drain D25 D when closed. The decrease in discharges was expected, as in a rock 

mass of uniform permeability k, discharges are proportional to k. It is known that in a rock 

mass of non-uniform permeability with zones k1, k2, k3, etc., the seepage pressure at a given 

point depends on the relative values of  k1, k2, k3, etc. (Londe 1973c). To analyse water 

pressures in more detail, variations in hydraulic head along a horizontal line that crosses drain 

D25 D in the upstream-downstream direction were studied. The line crosses the horizontal 

layer of higher permeability upstream from the drain at half its depth. Results of the main 

model were compared with the results of a model in which the near-surface area upstream 

from the dam is as pervious as the rock mass (model in which it is assumed that there is no 

area of higher permeability upstream from the dam) (Figure 6.35). 

The area of higher permeability is located between mesh coordinates 10.0 m and 15.0 m in the 

upstream-downstream direction. Analysis of Figure 6.35 allows the comparison of the 

different cases: 

- In normal operating conditions, the decrease in the permeability of the area of higher 

permeability from 10 × 10
-7

 m/s to 0.1 × 10
-7

 m/s leads to a greater loss of hydraulic 

head in that area; 

- When drain D25 D is closed, the greater loss of hydraulic head in the area being 

studied leads to a smaller hydraulic head at the point where the horizontal line meets 

the layer of higher permeability upstream from the drain (line a). As the permeability 

is lower, discharges are smaller; therefore the loss of hydraulic head in the horizontal 

layer of higher permeability upstream from the drain is smaller. This is the reason why 

the slope of the blue line is less steep than that of the red one.  

Results show that changing the assumed hydraulic conductivity of the near-surface area of 

higher permeability upstream from the dam has limited effect; therefore the existence of 

vertical fissures in that area can be simulated by any k value as long as it is much greater than 

that of the rock mass.

6.5.5 Influence of the permeability of the horizontal layers upstream from the 

drains 

To study the influence of the permeability of the horizontal layers between the upstream area 

and the drains, numerical analysis was carried out by varying permeability in those layers 

from 2.0 × 10
-7

 m/s up to 20 × 10
-7

 m/s. Results are shown in Table 6.25 and Figure 6.36. 

Results show that discharges are proportional to the permeability of the horizontal layers 

upstream from the drains. As in the case presented in the previous sub-chapter, water 

pressures decrease with a decrease in the horizontal layers’ permeability. As previously, to 

analyse water pressures in more detail, variations in hydraulic head along a horizontal line 

that crosses drain D25 D and is in the upstream-downstream direction were studied and the 

results of the main model, in which the permeability of the layers upstream from the drains is 

5.0 × 10
-7

 m/s, were compared with the results of a model in which the permeability of the 

layers upstream from the drains is 2.0 × 10
-7

 m/s (Figure 6.37).

The area of higher permeability is located between mesh coordinates 10.0 m and 15.0 m and 

layers of higher permeability between coordinates 0.0 m and 10.0 m, in the upstream- 

downstream direction. Analysis of Figure 6.37 leads to the following conclusions: 

- in normal operating conditions, the decrease in the layers’ permeability leads to a 

greater loss of hydraulic head where the area of higher permeability upstream from the 

dam meets the layer upstream of the drains (line a); 

- when drain D25 D is closed, a decrease in the layers permeability leads to a greater 

loss of hydraulic head and, consequently, to a lower hydraulic head at the drain. 

Results lead to the conclusion that changing the permeability of the horizontal layers upstream 

from the drains has a large effect on drain discharges and a lesser effect on pressures when the 

drain is closed.

6.5.6 Influence of the width of higher permeability layers upstream from the 

drains  

The influence of the width of the higher permeability layers upstream from the drains was 

assessed carrying out a numerical analysis in which layers’ width was gradually increased 

(Figure 6.38): 

- firstly, it was assumed that there was no layer of higher permeability (Figure 6.38 a);  

- secondly, the layer’s width upstream from drain D25 D was increased by 1.0 m for 

three times, until the distance between drains was reached (Figure 6.38 b, c and d);  

- thirdly, the layer width upstream from drain D26 D (the layer at drain D26 D is 2.0 m 

higher than the layer at drain D25 D) was increased by 0.5 m for three times, until 

half-distance between drains was reached (main model) (Figure 6.38 e, f and g); 

- Finally, it was assumed that the layer at drain D26 D was 3.0 m wide, the distance 

between drains, and that there was also a layer upstream from drain D24 D. 

Results are shown in Table 6.26 and Figure 6.39. Results analysis show that discharges and 

water pressure in drain D25 D when closed increase gradually as the layer upstream from 

drain D25 D becomes larger. Discharge increase is greater in drain D25 D, which is crossed 

by the layer. Increases in both discharges and water pressure also occur as the width of the 

layer upstream from drain D26 D increases, until the seepage path crosses drain D26 D. When 

the latter is crossed by the layer: i) there is an increase in the quantity of water in drain D26 D, 

both in normal operating conditions and with drain D25 D closed; ii) a slight decrease in the 

quantity of water in drain D25 D; and iii) a great loss of water pressure in drain D25 D when 

closed. Therefore, the widths of the higher permeability layers upstream from the drains used 

in the final model allow a good match of the distribution of discharges to the drains in the two 

simulated situations. Even small variations in widths lead to results that do not correspond to 

readings taken while carrying out the tests.  

The study carried out leads to the conclusion that in this area of Alqueva dam foundation, 

which is an area of low permeability, drainage is crucial for controlling water pressures as 

discontinuities with a very small aperture are never grouted.

6.5.7 Influence of total or partial clogging of drain D24 D 

Field results showed that drain D24 D was obstructed at elevation 54.67 m but there is no way 

of knowing how far the blockage extends. It was assumed in the main model that the drain 

was completely blocked from that point but it was also decided to simulate a partial blockage. 

Modelling drain D24 D as only partially clogged for 0.5 m, from elevation 54.17 m to 

54.67 m, instead of being completely clogged from elevation 54.67 m downwards, leads to 

very slight changes in discharges (Table 6.27): 

- an increase of 1.4 % in the quantity of water in drain D24 D;  

- an increase of 0.06 % in the quantity of water in drain D25 D; and 

- a decrease of 0.09 % in the in the quantity of water in drain D26 D.  

From the numerical results it was also possible to conclude that the hydraulic head in drain 

D25 D when closed is, in both cases, 4.18 bar.

6.5.8 Conclusions 

Parametric studies are important whenever there are ill-known or unknown parameters, for 

which values have to be attributed. Parameter analysis carried out led to the conclusion that 

the model for drain D25 D is only slightly affected by variations in both the grout curtain 

permeability and in the hydraulic conductivity of the more pervious area upstream from the 

dam, as long as it is much greater than that of the rock mass. It was also concluded that 

knowing whether drain D24 D was totally or only partially obstructed was not relevant. 

However, the model is highly sensitive to increase in rock mass equivalent permeability, 

which leads to a non-realistic situation, with larger quantities of water flowing into the drains 

at their lower areas. Drain discharges are also highly affected by changes in the permeability 

of the horizontal layers upstream from the drains. The widths of these layers are also essential 

parameters, as recorded water pressures and discharges could only be obtained with the 

widths adopted.

6.6 Global three-dimensional hydraulic model 

Results of tests carried out in situ, presented in chapter 4.5, and conclusions drawn from the 

detailed 3D models, presented in the previous sections, were used to develop a global 

hydraulic model of the foundation. In this type of model, due to the size of the area being 

studied, the average edge length of the tetrahedral zones is much greater than the ones 

employed in the previous section, and it is often necessary to simulate the drainage system in 

a simplified way. As mentioned in chapter 5, the drainage system can be simulated by a 

hypothetical continuous trench with the same depth as the drains.  

For application to arch dams, special routines for concrete arch dam analysis are included in 

3DEC code (Lemos 1996; 1998; 1999a) which allow the adequate geometric fitting of the 

concrete structure, represented by finite element blocks, and the rock mass in the foundation, 

represented by regular polyhedral deformable blocks. The FE mesh of the dam arch is first 

created, usually using suitable pre-processing software, and is represented by one or more 

blocks and formed by 20-noded isoparametric brick elements. These finite elements, of an 

order higher than the foundation tetrahedra, allow the modelling of the curved arch geometry 

and provide a good approximation of the bending behaviour of concrete arches, even with 

only one element across the thickness. When the dam is represented by a group of blocks, the 

movement of the contraction joints can be taken into account. When only one element across 

the dam’s thickness is used, there are only three grid contact points across the shell thickness, 

and the stress distribution is not very accurate. Meshes with more than one element across the 

thickness allow a better simulation not only of contact stresses but also of uplift distribution in 

the concrete/rock mass interface. Therefore, a dam-foundation system can be analysed in a 

more accurate and efficient way than would be possible with the uniform stress tetrahedral 

elements employed in the standard deformable blocks available in 3DEC (Lemos 1998; 

Resende et al. 2004). 

6.6.1 Model description 

The hydraulic foundation rock mass model was developed in various steps taking into account 

the mesh of Alqueva dam, shown in Figure 6.40, and the existence of both the grout and 

drainage curtains. The methodology used in model development is presented. Although 3DEC 

code was used, the methodology could easily be applied with other computer codes. The FE 

mesh of Alqueva dam arch, with two elements across the thickness, was created outside 

3DEC by a code developed at LNEC (Batista 1998). Figure 6.41 shows the modelling steps. 

In this figure, the curved finite element faces that compose the dam are divided into triangular 

faces, in order to simplify the graphical representation. 



   262 

In the first modelling step, the blocks under the dam are created with one of their faces 

adjacent to the foundation surface of the FE mesh (Figure 6.41 a). As the faces of the 

foundation surface may be curved, it is first necessary to set the nodes along the edges of 

contact faces exactly at the midpoint of the edges, so that they can fit the polyhedral 

foundation blocks (Itasca 2003). Each element’s foundation surface is divided into eight 

triangles, by including an extra grid-point at the centre of the element face. Five blocks are 

created under each foundation surface, as shown in Figure 6.42. Blocks under the dam go 

down to elevation 0.0. Then these blocks are cut in order to define the drainage length. 

Different colours represent different region numbers. After cutting the foundation, the same 

region number is given to blocks below the cut. The drainage curtain is simulated by a 

hypothetical continuous trench and was defined cutting the upstream upper blocks mid-way 

along vertical planes. In this way, the drainage curtain is defined about 10 m downstream 

from the upstream edge. 

In the second and third modelling steps, blocks upstream and downstream from the dam are 

created taking into account the upstream and downstream edges (Figure 6.41 b and c). To 

apply boundary conditions at an appropriate distance from the dam, the model was extended 

to a length of 475 m in the upstream-downstream direction. Figure 6.41 c) shows the different 

blocks created upstream from the dam, where the grout curtain is represented in red. In order 

to simplify the model, the grout curtain is modelled adjacent to the upstream edge, not 

underneath the dam itself. Foundation blocks are afterwards cut at a distance of about 35 m 

upstream and downstream from the dam in order to define finer meshes in the areas close to 

the dam. 

Finally, the model is extended laterally and downwards, with brick shape blocks, in order to 

create a model large enough for the boundaries not to have an influence on numerical results. 

As previously mentioned, the foundation mesh is automatically created by 3DEC, given the 

average dimension of the tetrahedral zones. In the model shown in Figure 6.41 d) the dam is 

represented by a mesh of 30 blocks and the rock mass by 1443 blocks. The new version of the 

3DEC code used in this study allows the analysis of steady-state flow using an equivalent 

continuum model in tetrahedral zoned blocks, but not in FE blocks. Therefore, the dam, which 

was essential to create the foundation model, had to be deleted in the global hydraulic model.

A very coarse mesh was first created, in which the average edge lengths of the tetrahedral 

zones were: i) 6.0 m in the blocks surrounding the drainage curtain; ii) 10.0 m in the vicinity 

of the above-mentioned blocks, including the grout curtain area; iii) 15.0 m in areas close to 

the dam in the upstream and downstream direction (shown in light blue in Figure 6.41 b and 

c; and iv) 30.0 m in the remaining rock mass. The mesh, with 40595 grid-points and divided 

into 64277 tetrahedra, is shown in Figure 6.43 a). Because the edges of the tetrahedral zones 

in the model’s outer blocks are so long, the phreatic surface is not clearly identified in the 

results’ graphical representation, thus a finer mesh was created in which the average lengths 

of the tetrahedral zones are about two thirds of those assumed in the very large mesh (4.0 m, 

8.0 m, 12.0 m and 20.0 m instead of 6.0 m, 10.0 m, 15.0 m and 30.0 m, respectively). This 

second mesh, which was used in subsequent analysis, has 67413 grid-points and is divided 

into 139397 zones (Figure 6.43 b).

6.6.2 Hydraulic boundary conditions 

Numerical analysis was carried out using the water levels recorded in October 2006, while 

carrying out the first borehole water-inflow tests, with the reservoir at an elevation of 143.6 m 

and water downstream from the dam-wall at an elevation of 81.95 m. At the drainage curtain, 

the hydraulic head in each block was assumed to be equal to the average elevation of the 

drains’ head. 

In the 3DEC models presented thus far hydraulic boundary conditions were easily applied, in 

areas defined by coordinate ranges in the x, y and z directions. In this global model, however, 

it is not as easy to apply neither the upstream and downstream heads, due to surface 

topography, nor the hydraulic head at the drainage curtain, due to its horizontal and vertical 

curvature. A procedure was devised, using the concept of the unit normal vector to a plane, by 

which only the surfaces in contact with a) the reservoir, b) tailwater, and c) drainage curtain, 

were identified. This allowed hydraulic heads to be properly applied, by allocating a different 

surface region number, as allowed by 3DEC, to each set a), b), and c).  

Unlike the detailed analysis of seepage presented in the previous sections where flow took 

place in the upstream-downstream direction through a confined medium, here seepage flow is 

not confined as there is a water table in each abutment, due to the natural side-hill seepage. 

6.6.3 Results analysis 

A series of numerical experiments was carried out, with the model of which the mesh is 

shown in Figure 6.43 b), in order to obtain numerical discharges in the foundation of each 

dam block close to those observed. These experiments led to the conclusion that parameters 

determined using the detailed numerical models described in section 6.4 can not be used 

directly in a global 3D model of the foundation as, due to the difference in the elements’ size 

and scale, local permeable layers and individual drains can not be represented. However, the 

different areas identified in the detailed models can be simulated, taking into account the 

average value of discharges and water pressures recorded in each block. It was assumed that 

the rock mass equivalent permeability was 1.0 × 10
-8

 m/s. A near-surface area of higher 

permeability (10 × 10
-7

 m/s) was simulated upstream from the grout curtain, which 

encompasses the valley bottom and the base of each slope (Figure 6.44). As in the detailed 

models, horizontal layers of higher permeability between the above-mentioned near-surface 

area and the drainage curtain were considered in some of the dam blocks, to take into account 

areas where flow paths cross the drains, identified with the tests carried out in situ. 

 

 



   266 

The model was first run assuming that the rock mass equivalent permeability was 

1.0 × 10
-8

 m/s, and that the grout curtain was 10 times less pervious. In order to represent the 

near-surface area and the horizontal layers of higher permeability the model had to be cut 

again. This new model has 1534 blocks, 68333 gridpoints, and is divided into 140131 

tetrahedra (Figure 6.45). The new model´s mesh is slightly finer than that shown in Figure 

6.43 b), in the areas where cuts were made. With the above-mentioned hydraulic boundary 

conditions, the numerical discharge at the valley bottom is 12.47 l/min, which is about 68 % 

of the total discharge recorded in that area (18.42 l/min). Numerical analysis was carried out 

in steps, changing a parameter at a time. Table 6.28 shows, as an example, the increase in the 

quantity of water flowing through the model and in the foundation of block 17-18 when the 

permeability of different foundation areas was changed.

The procedure explained in the previous paraghaphs was then applied to the remaining 

blocks:  in the foundation of some of the dam blocks located in the valley bottom, the 

permeability of the horizontal layers between the near-surface area of higher permeability and 

the drainage curtain was gradually adjusted in order to obtain numerical discharges close to 

average recorded discharges. Table 6.29 shows three sets of permeability values which were 

assumed while carrying out numerical analysis. Numerical errors obtained were analysed 

using three different parameters, which provide complementary information: 

iii) mean error, x  , which gives an idea of the trend, showing whether the numerical 

results are higher or lower than those recorded, given by:

The lower the mean absolute error and the mean squared error, the better the model. Analysis 

of Table 6.30 shows that the set of permeability values with which numerical results are 

closer to those recorded is set 3. 

In the final model (Set 3), in addition to rock mass equivalent permeability, only four different 

permeability values were used: 0.4, 0.5, 1.0 and 3.5 × 10

 m/s. Figure 6.46 shows how close 

the total discharges recorded in each arch block are to the numerical results obtained with the 

heterogeneous foundation model described above. The same figure shows the results of a

Figure 6.47 shows the hydraulic head contours. The graphical interface used to show the 

results (GID) (CIMNE 2006) only shows the hydraulic head contours on block surfaces, 

therefore when the phreatic surface is below the top of the block, that block appears as a 

hollow space. In order to represent the hydraulic head more accurately it is necessary to show 

cuts, as in Figure 6.48. In this figure part of the drainage curtain is visible in the cut 

perpendicular to the main river channel. 

With the aim of comparing numerical water pressures with those recorded in the foundation 

of block 17-18, when drains D21 D to D26 D were closed simultaneously, presented in 

section 4.5.8.3, the model was run once more, this time assuming the same hydraulic head on 

the surfaces which simulate the drainage curtain in the foundation of the above-mentioned 

block, as if there were a hypothetical continuous piezometric trench, and preventing water 

from flowing out of this trench. The hydraulic head on these surfaces is the average drain 

head’s elevation in block 17-18. In the 3DEC code, this is simulated by linking all the 

gridpoints located on the surfaces which define the “piezometric trench”, for all the gridpoints 

on those surfaces to have the same hydraulic head. 

The in situ tests were carried out with the reservoir at around 148.0 m and the tailwater at 

81.6 m. When drains D21 D to D26 D were closed simultaneously, water pressures of 0.275 

to 5.6 bar were recorded in drains and piezometers located in the foundation of block 17-18, 

with an average of 2.30 bar. This average water pressure was around 27 % of the hydraulic 

head. With the global 3D hydraulic model and with the previously mentioned water levels, the 

head at the drainage curtain in the foundation of block 17-18 is 88.10 m, which is 32 % of the 

hydraulic head. The numerical hydraulic head is very close to that recorded, and therefore it 

can be concluded that the simplified global hydraulic model here presented can provide mean 

water pressures and flow rates for each dam foundation block.

6.7 Hydromechanical interaction in the foundation of Alqueva dam 

6.7.1 Introduction 

In the previous section, seepage was analysed using a global 3D model of the dam foundation. 

In this model it was assumed that there is an area of higher permeability upstream from the 

dam, in the valley bottom and at the base of each slope (between dam vertical joints 6 to 21 as 

shown in Figure 6.44), and horizontal layers of higher permeability between the upstream area 

and the drainage curtain, upstream from, and underneath, some of the dam blocks located in 

the mentioned area. Numerical analysis was carried out assuming water levels recorded in 

October 2006, in the week in which the first borehole water-inflow tests were done. 

Comparisons made afterwards between numerical and recorded discharges led to the 

conclusion that the apertures of the discontinuities through which water flows vary with 

changes in reservoir level. Therefore, based on the results of borehole water-inflow tests, 

presented in chapter 4, and on available field data, an attempt was made to estimate the 

relation between stress and permeability. 

The hydromechanical interaction in the foundation of Alqueva dam was studied taking into 

account the results of the hydraulic model described in the previous section and of a 

mechanical model developed afterwards, which is going to be presented in section 6.7.3. 

Uncoupled hydraulic and mechanical analyses were carried out independently, and curves 

between stress and permeability were established taking into account recorded discharges in 

the foundation of each dam block and total stresses obtained with the mechanical model.  

The main aim of the study is to develop a methodology which can be used to establish rules 

which, from a hydraulic model calibrated for specific reservoir and tailwater levels, allow the 

calculation of discharges for other reservoir levels. These rules, that directly relate the 

permeability with the state of stress, can be established taking into account either effective or 

total stresses. In the study presented here mechanical analysis was carried out without taking 

into account water pressures and therefore total stresses were obtained. If the effective stress 

had been considered, different curves would be obtained, which, however, should lead to 

results equivalent to those obtained. From a theoretical point of view, because water flows 

through the foundation, it would be more correct to consider the mechanical actions of the 

water, and the effective stress rather than the total stress. However, in this case of Alqueva 

dam, as is going to be confirmed, vertical fissures open in the foundation close to the heel of 

the dam and flow through the conductive discontinuities is mainly horizontal. Therefore, in 

this case, it can be assumed that vertical stresses are not affected by seepage forces. Effective 

stresses are relevant for the safety assessment, in which what really matters is the water 

pressure at the base of the dam or in sub-horizontal discontinuities close to the base. This 

issue is going to be addressed in the following chapter.

This section describes the study carried out in order to establish a relation between stress and 

permeability in some areas of Alqueva dam foundation. Firstly, the results of the comparisons 

which led to this study are presented, followed by a description of the numerical mechanical 

model developed in order to estimate the aperture of vertical discontinuities within the rock 

mass close to the heel of the dam and to assess stresses in the foundation rock mass. The 

results of this model are analysed and compared with field data. The section then goes on to 

show how relationships between the permeability of the horizontal layers, which simulate 

water conductive joints, and the average vertical stresses in the same areas can be established. 

In addition, an attempt is made to establish a relation between local rock mass deformability 

and permeability. In the last part of this section, assumptions and simplifications made during 

analysis are discussed. Finally, a brief summary and the main conclusions of the study are 

presented. 

6.7.2 Comparison of numerical and recorded discharges with the reservoir at 
different elevations 

The global model of the dam foundation referred to in the previous section was calibrated for 

the reservoir at an elevation of 143.6 m and water downstream from the dam-wall at an 

elevation of 81.95 m. The same model was used to determine the total discharges in each arch 

block with the reservoir at different elevations, corresponding to the various water level stages 

during the controlled first filling of the reservoir: 

- around 115.0 m, recorded on 18 September 2002 (stabilizing level 1 (NE1)); 

- around 130.0 m, recorded on 6 February 2003 (P1); 

- around 143.5 m, recorded on 21 January 2004 (P2); and 

- around 150.0 m, recorded on 28 February 2007 (stabilizing level 2 (NE2)). 

On the first three mentioned dates, tailwater level was around 74.8 m. From 28 October 2005, 

the first filling of Pedrógão reservoir increased Alqueva’s tailwater level, which was 81.95 m 

on 16 October 2006, in the week when the first water-inflow tests were carried out, and 

81.2 m on 28 February 2007.  

Comparisons between recorded and numerical discharges for the different water levels, shown 

in Figure 6.49, lead to the conclusion that, in the area being studied, the model overestimates 

discharges for water levels lower than 143.6 m and underestimates discharges for water levels 

higher than that. In fact, this is observed in every block with only a few exceptions: numerical 

discharges are lower than those recorded on 6 February 2003 in dam block 14-15 and on 21 

January 2004 in dam blocks 8-9, 9-10 and 14-15; and are higher than those recorded on 28 

February 2007 in dam blocks 13-14 and 17-18.

 275 

Results of numerical analysis carried out for the water levels recorded on 18 September 2002 

show that discharges obtained with the homogeneous foundation model are higher than 

recorded discharges in every dam block, therefore the model can not be employed for the 

lower water levels in the reservoir. 

Figure 6.50 shows numerical discharges in the foundation of each dam block for the various 

reservoir levels. Figure analysis shows that in block 19-20, where the highest total discharges 

are recorded, numerical flow increases about 81 %, from 3.1 to 5.6 l/min, when the water 

level in the reservoir increases 35 m, from about 115 m up to about 150 m. Figure analysis 

also shows that almost the same results are obtained for the water levels recorded in January 

2004 and October 2006, which leads to the conclusion that the tailwater level has very little 

influence.

6.7.3 Numerical mechanical model 

6.7.3.1 Model description 

The model used to carry out mechanical analysis is geometrically similar to the hydraulic 

model presented in the previous chapter. However, unlike the above mentioned model, which 

only includes the foundation, the mechanical model of the dam-foundation system requires 

that not only the dam be represented but also the location of fault 22, in order to simulate the 

area of lower modulus of elasticity, where the phyllite occurs. Phyllite deformability is 

assumed above the lower wall of the fault and green schist deformability in the remaining 

rock mass. Fault 22 is assumed to be 10 m wide. The model is shown in Figure 6.51.  

The dam is simulated by a group of finite element elastic blocks separated by joints, which 

represent vertical contraction joints. In the foundation a joint is assumed at the dam/rock mass 

interface (“foundation joint”), and, as the grout curtain is simulated adjacent to the upstream 

edge, two hypothetical joints were assumed between the grout curtain and the rock mass, at 

the upstream and downstream faces of the grout curtain, respectively (“grout curtain/rock 

interface”), so as to estimate the aperture of discontinuities in the uppermost strata of the 

foundation. The grout curtain/rock interface is considered only between dam joints 6 to 21, 

corresponding to the location of the area of higher permeability upstream from the dam 

assumed in the global hydraulic model of the dam foundation (Figure 6.44). 

The rock mass, assumed to be isotropic, is represented by 2178 deformable blocks, internally 

divided into 143881 zones. The average edge lengths of the tetrahedral zones are the same as 

those used in the hydraulic model (4.0 m in the blocks surrounding the drainage curtain, 8.0 m 

in the vicinity of the above mentioned blocks, including the grout curtain area, 12.0 m in the 

areas close to the dam in the upstream and downstream direction, and 20.0 m in the remaining 

rock mass).

6.7.3.2 Material properties 

Material and joint properties are shown in Table 6.31 and Table 6.32. Both dam concrete and 

foundation rock mass, as well as the dam contraction joints, are assumed to follow elastic 

linear behaviour. Foundation joint and grout curtain/rock interface are assigned a Mohr-

Coulomb constitutive model.  

Dam Young’s modulus is assumed to be 20 GPa. The existence of contraction joints leads to 

an increase in the dam´s deformability which, in practice, is difficult to quantify. When 

modelling, if the dam is simulated as a single block, dam Young’s modulus is usually 

adjusted in such a way that numerical results already include the effect of joint deformability. 

When the dam is simulated as a group of blocks separated by joints, deformability properties 

of both concrete and joints have to be adjusted to match the whole structure’s deformability. 

In order to have a measure of the effect of these joint stiffnesses it is possible to define a 

fictitious equivalent width of concrete which has the same deformability of the joint. This 

equivalent width (e) is given by: 

n
k

E
e ?  

(6.7) 

Therefore, in this case, a joint normal stiffness (kn) of 10 GPa/m corresponds to the 

assumption that vertical contraction joints have a width of 2 m of material identical to dam 

concrete. Joint widths of 0.5 to 2 m of material identical to dam concrete are normally used in 

3D analysis of dams behaviour (Lemos et al. 2006; Pina et al. 2006). A ratio of 0.5 is assumed 

between normal and shear stiffnesses (kn = 10 GPa/m and ks = 5 GPa/m).  

Contraction joints were injected with the dam concrete at temperatures lower than 10°C, with 

the joints quite wide open, in order to ensure that, once injection was concluded, the dam 

would behave as a monolithic block. Analysis of recorded joint movements with the reservoir 

at different levels higher than 112 m shows that the opening and closure of joints is lower 

than 0.5 mm, which is within jointmeter’s accuracy (LNEC 2008), therefore the joints can be 

considered closed. The only exceptions are the joints which link the arch to both gravity 

structures, in the right and left banks (joints 1 and 25), in which apertures up to 1.5 mm were 

recorded in jointmeters located close to the downstream face of the dam, on dates when the 

temperature was very low. As the dam joints are closed, the assumption of joint elastic 

behaviour is justified. 

It is assumed that rock mass Young’s modulus is 10 GPa where schist occurs and that the 

phyllite area is two times more deformable. Grout curtain properties are the same as those in 

the rock mass foundation, either schist or phyllite. 



 279 

Foundation joint and grout curtain/rock interface properties were changed during numerical 

analysis, as shown in Table 6.32. Firstly, the model was run until equilibrium, assuming 

elastic behaviour (Model 1). Two non-linear analyses were afterwards carried out: in Model 2, 

non-linear behaviour of grout curtain/rock interface was assumed, with a friction angle of 35° 

and zero cohesion and tensile strength at this interface; in Model 3, the above-mentioned joint 

properties were assumed not only at the grout curtain/rock interface but also at the upstream 

area of the foundation joint (in the valley bottom, between dam joints 8 to 18, the upstream 

area of the foundation joint simulates the peripheral joint at the heel of the blocks, introduced 

to avoid stresses with the filling of the reservoir, as shown in Figure 4.9). 

In 3DEC, the way to simulate elastic continuity at the interfaces, shear and tensile strength 

being prevented, is to assign very high cohesion and tensile strength to the interfaces. 

Therefore, in Model 1, cohesion and tensile strength were assigned 10
20

 GPa at both 

interfaces. In Model 2 this value was only assigned to the foundation joint.  

As shown in Table 6.32, in Models 2 and 3, joints assumed to have non-linear behaviour were 

assigned zero tensile strength and zero cohesion. Assigning a zero tensile strength allows the 

interfaces to open in areas where tensile stresses occur. With a shear strength defined by 

cohesion zero and an assumed friction angle, only friction prevents interfaces from sliding.

6.7.3.3 Sequence of analysis 

Dam and foundation displacements and stresses were obtained in a simplified way 

considering three successive loading stages:  

i) in situ stresses due to the weight of the rock mass, before dam construction;  

ii) dam weight; and  

iii) hydrostatic load at various reservoir elevations.  

In the first stage, the usual procedure is to assume an approximate initial state of stress, and to 

obtain the in situ stresses by running the model until equilibrium, so that the determined in 

situ stresses take the valley geometry into account. At this stage of the analysis, the dam and 

the grout curtain have not yet been constructed, thus they should not be considered in the 

numerical analysis. However, in 3DEC, all the blocks must be created before zoning them and 

running the model. In this code, the procedure to ensure that dam weight and stiffness do not 

influence in situ stresses is to assign zero gravity load to FE blocks and to assume a very low 

dam Young’s modulus, to make the dam follow the valley deformation. Stresses due to dam 

deformation are set to zero once equilibrium is reached, in order not to include these stresses 

in subsequent analysis. Therefore, at this stage of analysis, dam Young’s modulus, which is 

about 20 GPa, was assumed to be 100 times lower.  

Numerical analysis started from a given hydrostatic state of stress, close to the in situ state of 

stress due to rock mass weight. An estimate of the initial vertical stress component was 

obtained, as usual, assuming that it increases with depth, due to the weight of the upper rock 

mass. This relationship is valid, as shown by Hoek and Brown (1980), who collated 

worldwide in situ stress data. There is, however, a significant amount of scatter in the 

measurements (Figure 6.52). In an elastic homogeneous media, assuming that the two 

horizontal stresses are equal, this simplified hypothesis of in situ stresses due only to rock 

mass weight, leads to: 

y

.?? ??  (6.8) 

yzx
k ??? ??

 

(6.9) 

 

with:

where ?r is the rock mass unit weight, y is the depth below the surface of the rock mass (in the 

3DEC model presented here, x-axis towards the left bank; y-axis vertical; and z-axis towards 

upstream); and ? is the Poisson’s ratio. Assuming elastic behaviour, a Poisson’s ratio of 0.2 



 281 

(Table 6.31) corresponds to a ratio of horizontal to vertical stresses of 0.25. In practice, higher 

k values are observed, as shown in Figure 6.53. The same figure shows that close to the 

surface readings are extremely widely scattered, but with increasing depth, the k values 

decrease.

and Brown 1980). 

 

 

 

Figure 6.53 – Collated worldwide in situ stress data: mean horizontal stress component (after 

Hoek and Brown 1980). 



   282 

Prior to dam construction, direct measurements of horizontal stresses were taken using small 

flatjacks inserted into exposed rock surfaces, in excavated galleries (LNEC 1973). Two 

measurements were taken on the left bank, 13 and 20 m below rock mass surface and one on 

the right bank, 12 m below surface, from which ratios of horizontal to vertical stresses of 

0.87, 0.94, and 1.26 were determined, respectively. The small amount of available data is not 

enough to provide useful information; therefore it was assumed that the ratio of horizontal to 

vertical stresses was 0.5, which is more realistic than the k value given by the elasticity 

theory. 

In situ stresses were determined assuming a homogeneous rock mass, with a unit weight of 

26.5 kN/m
3
 and a Young’s modulus of 10 GPa, assumed to be uniform in the whole 

foundation. The simplest hypothesis of a homogeneous foundation was considered, and the 

more deformable area where the phyllite occurs was assigned the same properties as the 

schistous area. It was assumed that the hydrostatic state of stress varied linearly in each valley 

slope, from the valley bottom to the top of both right and left banks. 

Regarding boundary conditions, vertical displacements at the base of the model and horizontal 

displacements perpendicular to each of the four lateral model boundaries were prevented.  

The simplifications made at this stage of analysis have little effect on numerical results, as in 

near surface structures, such as dams, the effect of in situ stresses is low. 

In the second stage, additional loading corresponds to dam weight, therefore real dam 

Young’s modulus and stiffness were assumed. Dam construction sequence was not taken into 

account, and the dam weight was applied as a whole. Joints and interfaces were assumed to 

have elastic behaviour. In this phase, the foundation was assumed to be more deformable 

above the lower wall of fault 22, in the phyllite area. Boundary conditions were the same as 

those assumed in the previous phase. As the dam weight is a vertical load, the same results are 

obtained with these boundary conditions as with displacements prevented at the base of the 

model and at the lateral boundaries. 

In the third stage, hydrostatic loading corresponding to various reservoir levels was applied 

to the upstream face of the dam. Boundary conditions were changed, preventing any 

displacement at the base of the model and at the lateral boundaries. The model was first 

brought to equilibrium assuming elastic behaviour. From this state of equilibrium, Models 2 

and 3 were run for more steps, until convergence was achieved, as in this way interfaces were 

allowed to open. Once they open, stresses become zero.

6.7.3.4 Results analysis 

First loading stage (in situ stresses) 

At the beginning of the numerical analysis, in situ stresses due to the weight of the rock mass 

are obtained. Figure 6.54 shows principal stresses in tetrahedra belonging to each foundation 

block, in a vertical cross section perpendicular to the valley axis (compressive stresses are 

negative). Results show a realistic stress pattern, with vertical stresses increasing with depth 

and horizontal stresses decreasing close to the surface of the rock mass and valley slopes. 

Second loading stage (dam weight) 

In the second phase of analysis, influence of dam weight is assessed. Gridpoint displacements 

were set to zero before cycling the system until equilibrium. Horizontal arch displacements at 

crest elevation (154 m), shown in Figure 6.55, are towards upstream and are higher in the left 

bank because phyllite is more deformable than the green schist. Figure 6.56 shows 

displacements and principal stresses at, and underneath, the central cross section. The crest of 

the central cantilever moves towards upstream, with a horizontal displacement of 9.8 mm and 

vertical displacement of 13.3 mm downwards. In the dam concrete, maximum compressive 

stresses were determined in directions close to the vertical, at the heel of the dam, and at this 

stage went up to 4.7 MPa. Tensile stresses in the arches were barely obtained. 

In the rock mass, maximum vertical displacements were determined underneath the dam and 

were higher in the left bank, because phyllite is more deformable than green schist. Maximum 

vertical displacements of 9.4 mm were determined. In foundation blocks below the heel of the 

central cantilever average compressive stresses of around 2.2 MPa were determined, which 

approximately corresponds to vertical stresses due to dam weight 

(2400 kg/m
3
 × 10 m/s

2
 × 96 m = 2.3 MPa). 

Third loading stage (hydrostatic loading) 

The mechanical response of the dam/foundation system under hydrostatic loading, for 

different reservoir levels, is obtained in the third phase of analysis. The following paragraphs 

present the radial displacements at the crest of the central cantilever, normal joint 

displacements, and average vertical stresses in the foundation blocks below the dam arch 

which simulate conductive joints in the global hydraulic model of the dam foundation. 

Gridpoint displacements were reset at the beginning of this loading stage, so the 

displacements presented are only due to hydrostatic loading. Results for the three different 

models considered in this phase of analysis are presented: 

Model 1 – elastic; 

Model 2 – non-linear behaviour of grout curtain/rock mass interface;

Model 3 – non-linear behaviour of both grout curtain/rock mass interface and foundation 

joint. 

As in the previous loading stage, two figures showing the horizontal arch displacements at 

crest elevation (154 m), and displacements and principal stresses at, and underneath, the 

central cross section are presented (Figure 6.57 and Figure 6.58). Both figures show results of 

Model 1, for the highest reservoir level. Naturally, displacements are towards downstream and 

are slightly higher in the left bank, due to the existence of the phyllite area. The crest of the 

central cantilever moves towards downstream, with a horizontal displacement of 60.47 mm 

and vertical displacement of 7.32 mm downwards. In the dam concrete, maximum 

compressive stresses of around 10 MPa were determined in the lower area of block 21-22, 

close to the downstream face of the dam. In the central cantilever, maximum compressive 

stresses of around 4.5 MPa were determined not only in the lower arch area, close to the 

downstream face of the dam, but also in the arch upper area. 

Numerical analysis with the dam simulated as a single block, without vertical joints, was 

carried out and the results were compared to those obtained with the elastic model presented 

here (Model 1), in which dam joints behave elastically. Displacements at the crest of the 

central cantilever for the highest reservoir level and for the various reservoir levels referred to 

in section 1.2, determined with both models are shown in Table 6.33. The percentage of 

displacement increase when the existence of joints is assumed is shown in brackets. It can be 

seen that, for the highest reservoir level, contraction joints 2 m wide of material identical to 

dam concrete lead to an increase of around 15 % in the numerical horizontal displacement at 

the crest of the central cantilever, and of around 5 % in the vertical displacement.  

Table 6.34 shows numerical radial displacements at the crest of the central cantilever for the 

different reservoir levels, determined with the three different models (Models 1, 2 and 3). 

Horizontal radial displacements and vertical displacements for the various reservoir levels are 

shown in Figure 6.59. The non-linear behaviour of the grout curtain/rock interface and of both 

the grout curtain/rock interface and foundation joint has only a slight effect on displacements, 

and only for the higher reservoir levels. For the highest reservoir level, a horizontal radial 

displacement at the crest of the central cantilever of around 60 mm is determined. In this case, 

the horizontal radial displacement obtained with Model 1 is 98 % of that obtained with Model 

3, which corresponds to a difference of 1.2 mm, and the vertical displacement is 36 % higher, 

which corresponds to a difference of 1.9 mm.  

Displacement histories in both y- and z-directions monitored at different points in the rock 

mass upstream and downstream from the grout curtain, in a section that crosses the dam 

central cantilever in the upstream/downstream direction led to the conclusion that the grout 

curtain/rock interface opens at the downstream face of the grout curtain, as shown in Figure 



   286 

6.60. Tensile stresses below the heel of the central cantilever, due to the filling of the 

reservoir, lead to the opening of the interfaces, with maximum normal and shear 

displacements shown in Table 6.35 and Figure 6.36, respectively. Analysis of the results of 

Model 3 shows that for the highest water level grout curtain/rock interface normal 

displacement is about 1.5 up to 2.1 mm in the upper 3 m. For the same reservoir level, the 

foundation joint opens about 3.4 mm close to the area where the upstream face of the dam 

meets the foundation (Figure 6.60), and slides about 1.4 mm. In both models, the maximum 

shear displacement at the grout curtain/rock interface decreases when the reservoir level 

increases from 115.5 m to 132.2 m, and gradually increases for higher reservoir levels. As 

shown in Figure 6.61, this is due to a change in the relative direction of movement between 

the grout curtain and the surrounding rock mass, when the reservoir goes up from 132.2 m to 

143.6 m.

Table 6.36 – Maximum shear joint displacement for different reservoir levels. 

As previously mentioned, the main purpose of this chapter is to establish relationships 

between the permeability of the horizontal layers considered in the hydraulic global model of 

the dam foundation, which simulate water conductive joints, and the average vertical stresses 

in the same areas. In 3DEC, each block is internally divided into tetrahedra with uniform 

stress; therefore vertical stresses in the foundation blocks below the heel of the dam which, in 

the hydraulic model, simulate conductive joints were obtained by averaging the vertical 

tetrahedral stresses. With the exception of blocks below dam blocks 7-8 and 8-9, which are 

crossed by fault 22, all elements are of about the same volume, therefore a simple average is 

adequate. If there were very narrow zones, weighted averages would have to be determined, 

taking into account each zone’s volume.

Figure 6.61 - Shear joint displacement vectors for the reservoir at a) 132.2 m, and b) 143.6 m. 

 

Naturally, as water rises in the reservoir vertical compressive stresses decrease. In the valley 

bottom, unlike close to both abutments, tensile stresses are calculated below the heel of the 

dam for the highest reservoir levels (Figure 6.62). Here, stresses increase gradually from the 

base of each slope towards the valley axis and Model 1 leads to lower compressive stresses 

and higher tensile stresses. Figure 6.62 analysis shows that the decrease in vertical tensile 

stresses in the foundation blocks below the heel of the dam is affected much more by the non-

linear behaviour of the foundation joint than by that of the grout curtain/rock interface. 

Variations in average total vertical stresses in the foundation of the central cantilever and of 

block 20-21 with changes in reservoir level are shown in Figure 6.63. For the highest water 

level, the tensile stress of 0.5 MPa determined with Model 1 below the heel of the central 

cantilever is almost three times that determined with Model 3. At the base of the central 

cantilever, vertical stresses determined with both models 2 and 3 are almost the same with the 

reservoir up to 143.6 m; but for reservoir levels higher than that, tensile stresses determined 

with Model 3 are lower, due to the opening of the foundation joint. At the base of block 

20-21, however, differences in vertical stresses determined with the three different models 

only occur for reservoir levels higher than 150.1 m.

6.7.3.5 Comparison of monitored and numerical results 

Horizontal displacement at the crest of the central cantilever 

Studies of quantitative interpretation based on recorded displacements in the inverted 

plumb-lines, led to the conclusion that horizontal displacements at the crest of the central 

cantilever due to hydrostatic loading are about 50 mm with the reservoir at around 150.0 m 

(LNEC 2009). Numerical horizontal displacements for the same reservoir level, presented in 

Table 6.34, are about 90 % of that recorded. 

Vertical displacement at foundation joint 

The peripheral joint is monitored with joint gauges, located around 5 metres apart along its 

length, positioned in such a way that each block has three gauges, one of which is located 

approximately halfway between dam vertical joints, as shown in Figure 6.64 for the case of 

the central cantilever. Figure 6.65 shows vertical displacements in the joint gauges located at 

the base of the central cantilever plotted versus time. Joint apertures were assumed to be zero 

on 2002.02.05, when the first filling of the reservoir began, therefore, from that date, recorded 

displacements would be mainly due to variations in hydrostatic load and to variations in 

ambient and reservoir temperatures (because variations in ambient and reservoir temperatures 

cause changes in the structure’s temperature which, in turn, give rise to arch displacements 

towards upstream if the temperature increases, or towards downstream otherwise). However, 

during the first four months of reservoir filling, not only was foundation treatment still in 

progress, but also, following artificial dam cooling, contraction joints were injected. In 

addition, construction of gravity blocks close to the left bank had been concluded only about 

one month before the beginning of reservoir filling, therefore the thermal field in dam 

concrete was significantly asymmetric. This is probably the reason why the first readings 

shown in Figure 6.65 are so widely scattered. 

For the highest reservoir levels recorded until the end of June 2008, of about 150 m, 

displacements of 0.6 up to 0.92 mm were recorded in joint gauge MJ18, the readings of which 

always showed a coherent pattern. As shown in Table 6.35, a numerical maximum foundation 

joint aperture of 1.5 mm is determined for the reservoir at an elevation of 150.1 m. At a 

distance of around 4.5 m from the upstream face of the dam, foundation joint aperture is about 

0.8 mm (half of the maximum), which is within the range of recorded displacements.

filling of the reservoir. It is observed that the length of rod extensometers (1) and (2), located 

in the upstream area, increases as the reservoir rises, whereas the length of extensometer (3), 

located at the downstream area, decreases (in vertical extensometers located in dam 

foundations, an increase in the relative displacement of the rod’s top and bottom is related to 

rock mass decompression, while a decrease is related to rock mass compression). Strains 

recorded in extensometer (1) are higher than those in extensometer (2) therefore the majority 

of the heave in that area occurs in the upper 15.0 m of the foundation rock mass. 

Extensometers located in the upstream area are more influenced by variations in ambient 

temperature than the one located downstream. With the reservoir level approximately 

constant, an increase in ambient temperature leads to settlement of both extensometers located 

at the upstream area, while a decrease leads to their heave, which is explained by arch dams’ 

behaviour. 

Table 6.37 shows recorded strains for different reservoir levels. In an attempt to determine 

variations in strains due merely to variations in reservoir level, only readings taken in 

February/beginning of March were considered. Even though, there is a difference of around 

11°C (from 7.8° up to 18.5°) in average ambient temperatures recorded in those selected 

dates. Variations in vertical strains are shown in Table 6.38, taking readings recorded on 

2004.02.03 as reference. 

Due to the size of the blocks below the central cantilever, shown in Figure 6.68, only a rough 

comparison of recorded and numerical strains could be carried out. Numerical average 

vertical stresses for the different reservoir levels and variations in strains are shown in Table 

6.39 and Table 6.40. Strains were calculated taking into account the rock mass deformability 

modulus assumed in the mechanical model, and variations in strains were determined taking 

the previously mentioned date as reference. In Table 6.40, percentages of recorded strains are 

shown in brackets. For the highest reservoir level, differences are of about 33 %.

Aperture of horizontal discontinuities through which water flows 

In dam block 17-18, recorded discharge increased around 8 times when the water in the 

reservoir increased from 115.45 m, recorded on 18 September 2002, to 143.6 m, recorded 

when the first borehole water-inflow tests were carried out in drain D25 D (from 0.23 l/min 

up to 1.93 l/min). Taking into account the cubic law and assuming that water flows through a 

single discontinuity, variation in a discontinuity’s aperture is equal to the cubic root of 

discharge increase; therefore, due to the above-mentioned increase in reservoir level, 

discontinuity aperture doubles. 

Numerical modelling of tests carried out in drain D25 D led to the conclusion that the 

horizontal layers of higher permeability upstream from the drain simulated horizontal 

discontinuities with a hydraulic aperture of 0.12 mm. In the global hydraulic foundation 

model, a similar layer in dam block 17-18 simulated a horizontal discontinuity with a 

hydraulic aperture of 0.06 mm. Taking these results into account and assuming that the 

discontinuity aperture doubles, a rough estimate is that aperture probably increases 0.10 mm, 

from 0.05 mm to 0.15 mm. In Model 3, differences in average vertical stresses for the various 

reservoir levels were used to determine variations in apertures of horizontal water conductive 

discontinuities below the heel of the dam. The following equations were used:

where ?uyy is the variation in the discontinuity aperture due to increase in reservoir level, ??yy 

and ??yy are variations in vertical strains and stresses, respectively, L is the height of the 

blocks which simulate seepage paths and E is rock mass deformability modulus. Table 6.41 

shows determined variations in the aperture of a horizontal water conductive discontinuity 

below dam block 17-18. Results obtained with the reservoir at an elevation of 115.45 m were 

used as reference.

Results presented in Table 6.41 are probably excessively high, as the variation in 

discontinuity aperture of 0.29 mm for the reservoir level of 143.6 m is greater than that 

expected taking recorded discharges into account. This may be due either to an excessive 

estimate of variations in vertical stresses, or to an inadequate rock mass deformability 

modulus.  Concerning the latter, an average rock mass deformability modulus of 10 GPa was 

assumed in the green schist area, but the Young’s modulus varies from one foundation area to 

another. Results presented in Table 6.41 for the reservoir at 143.6 m would lead to a variation 

of 0.10 mm in the discontinuity aperture if it were assumed that the area below the heel of 

block 17-18 was less deformable than the average, and a Young’s modulus of 29 GPa were 

considered.   

6.7.4 Hydromechanical interaction 

6.7.4.1 Introduction 

The hydromechanical interaction in the foundation of Alqueva dam was studied taking into 

account the results of both the hydraulic and mechanical models developed and carrying out 

independently uncoupled hydraulic and mechanical analyses. Firstly, the numerical hydraulic 

model was run for different reservoir levels and, for each level, the permeability of the 

horizontal layers which simulate water conductive joints was adjusted so that numerical 

discharges in the foundation of each dam block were close to recorded discharges. Secondly, 

the mechanical model was run assuming the same water levels, and average vertical stresses 

in the foundation blocks were obtained (blocks below the heel of the dam which, in the 

hydraulic model, simulate conductive joints). Finally, the above-mentioned results of both 

models allowed the plotting of graphs of stress versus permeability, from which a different 

correlation for some dam blocks could be established. 

6.7.4.2 Correlation between stress and permeability 

The mechanical model described in the previous section allows the calculation of stresses for 

different reservoir and tailwater levels and, as previously mentioned, does not take into 

account variations in ambient and reservoir temperature. Therefore, to establish the relation 

between stress and permeability, ensuring that discharges are mainly due to the effect of the 

hydrostatic loading, with small changes due to variations in dam temperature, only discharges 

recorded in February/beginning of March were taken into account in the subsequent analysis. 

Recorded discharges with the reservoir at low elevations were neglected, as it had been 

concluded that the hydraulic model could not be employed for the lower reservoir levels. 

Discharges monitored on six different dates were considered, with the reservoir level varying 

around 18 m, from 132.2 m up to 150.1 m. 



   298 

Recorded discharges in the foundation of the dam blocks located in the valley bottom and at 

the base of each slope on the above-mentioned dates, shown in Figure 6.69, reveal that field 

data is not always consistent, as discharges do not always increase with the reservoir level. 

That is the case, for example, with discharges recorded on 2008.03.04, with the reservoir at 

147.6 m, which, in dam blocks between joints 6 to 12, 13 to 15 and in block 17-18 were lower 

than those recorded on 13.02.2006, with the water 2.8 m lower. Around 20 % of the readings 

shown in Figure 6.69 were discarded due to inconsistency (21 readings out of 90). Discharges 

recorded in the foundation of the central cantilever (block 13-14) and those recorded with the 

three lower reservoir levels in blocks 10-11 and 20-21 also had to be neglected because 

numerical discharges obtained with the homogeneous model were higher than those recorded 

(in the homogeneous model an equivalent permeability of 1.0 × 10
-8

 m/s is assumed in the 

whole foundation and the grout curtain is assumed to be 10 times less pervious than the rock 

mass).  

After running the numerical hydraulic model for the various reservoir levels, the permeability 

of the horizontal layers which simulate water conductive joints was adjusted so that numerical 

discharges in the foundation of each dam block were close to recorded discharges (Table 

6.42). This adjustment was carried out taking into account that in a homogeneous rock mass 

discharges vary linearly with permeability.

Results presented in Table 6.42 reveal that in the foundation of one of the blocks, the 

permeability of a horizontal layer for a lower reservoir level can be higher than that for a 

higher level (e.g. block 8-9 and reservoir levels 144.8 m and 147.6 m). This is due to the fact 

that although the same model is used, boundary conditions vary. In some cases, an equivalent 

permeability lower than that of the rock mass (1.0 × 10
-8

 m/s) was calculated, which would 

mean that the horizontal layer which simulates water conductive joints was less pervious than 

the surrounding media. These results are not logical, and therefore were not taken into 

account. Figure 6.70 shows the variation in the permeability of the horizontal layers which 

simulate water conductive joints with the reservoir level of the blocks in which the number of 

points is equal or greater than 5. Exponential curves were adjusted to the values obtained, 

using regression analysis, and the R-squared values also displayed on the chart, varying from 

around 0.82 to 0.98, show that this type of curve fits the available data well. 

The average vertical stresses at the heel of the five above-mentioned blocks obtained with the 

mechanical model are shown in Figure 6.71. Analysis of the results began with an attempt to 

establish a correlation between stress and permeability assuming that, in each block, the 

permeability of the horizontal layer was a function of the vertical stress only. However, the 

results obtained were not coherent and it was later understood that permeability depends not 

only on average vertical stresses but also on local geological features, which vary from one 

dam foundation block to another:

Figure 6.71 - Variations in average vertical stresses in the foundation blocks below the heel of 

the dam with changes in reservoir level. 

Therefore, to establish a correlation between stress and permeability taking into account the 

influence of local geology it was necessary to choose a reservoir level as a reference and to 

plot graphs, for each dam block, of (?yy / ?yy ref) versus (k / k ref). When a water level is 

chosen as a reference and regression analysis is used to adjust curves to the values obtained, 

more weight is given to the permeability and stress obtained with that level. In order not to 

give more weight neither for the higher levels nor for the lower, monitored discharges on

2006.02.13 and stresses obtained with the reservoir at 144.8 m were used as reference. Figure 

6.72 shows the variation of the permeability of the horizontal layers which simulate 

conductive joints below the heel of different dam blocks with vertical stress. Both exponential 

and logarithmic curves were adjusted to each block’s set of data. In order to improve the 

adjustment of the curves, two pairs of values were neglected: block 8-9, with the reservoir at 

147.6 m, and block 15-16, with the reservoir at 144.0 m. Figure analysis leads to the 

conclusion that, although there is not a significant difference between the curves, exponential 

laws fit data better.

Figure 6.73 shows the data obtained and the exponential curves for the five dam blocks 

together.  The conclusion was drawn that variations in vertical stresses have less influence on 

permeability in the more pervious layers in the foundation of blocks 12-13, 16-17 and 17-18, 

and a large effect in blocks 8-9 and 19-20. For the highest water levels, compression stresses 

are very low, as shown in Figure 6.71, therefore the points obtained for the lower values of 

(?yy / ?yy ref) are more scattered.  

The number of recorded discharges analysed, on six different dates with the reservoir at 

different elevations, only made it possible to establish the dependence of permeability on 

stress for the foundation of five dam blocks. If a greater amount of data had been analysed, 

more and perhaps better relationships could have been established.  

The equivalent permeability values shown in Table 6.42 for the reservoir at 144.8 m, assumed 

as the reference level, were used to estimate the aperture of a hypothetical single discontinuity 

through which water flowed in the foundation of each block. These apertures are shown in 

Table 6.43 and were determined taking into account Darcy´s law and the cubic law, according 

to which discharge varies with the cube of the aperture: 

hikq
H

?  (6.13) 

i
ga

q
?12

3

?  (6.14) 

where q = discharge per metre through a layer of height h;  kH = hydraulic conductivity [LT
-1

]; 

i = hydraulic gradient (head loss/length over which head loss occurs); a = fracture hydraulic 

aperture [L]; v = kinematic viscosity of the fluid [L
2
 T

-1
]; and g = acceleration due to gravity 

[L T
-2

]. Assuming that the variation in the aperture of a horizontal discontinuity with the 

average vertical stress is approximately linear, variations in the aperture of a single horizontal 

discontinuity were compared with the curves established for blocks 8-9 and 19-20 and are 

shown in Figure 6.74. It can be seen that for block 19-20 the discharges match quite well 

when it is assumed that water flows through a single discontinuity, whereas for block 8-9 

there is a considerable difference indicating that water flows through more than one 

discontinuity. 

Discharges in each dam block were afterwards determined using the established curves shown 

in Figure 6.73, and the numerical results were compared with recorded discharges. The charts 

in Figure 6.75 and Figure 6.76 show recorded discharges alongside both the results of the 

model calibrated for water levels on different dates, using the equivalent permeability values 

shown in Table 6.42, and those of the model in which the different curves ?-k established 

were used. Results obtained with both the above-mentioned models are accurate, but the latter 

has the advantage  of using a generic law which is valid for the different water levels. In these

6.7.4.3 Correlation between permeability and local rock mass deformability 

According to most authors it is more correct to relate permeability with strain than with stress, 

in an equivalent continuum, as the aperture of discontinuities with a very high normal 

stiffness barely changes with variations in stresses (Brown and Bray 1982; Chen et al. 2007; 

Wei and Hudson 1990). 

In the previous section, curves which represent the dependence of permeability on stress were 

established. These curves follow the pattern: 

verticalekk
horizontal

???
?

(6.15) 

Taking into account that stresses in the vertical direction are given by

E ?? ? , the 

stress can be replaced by the strain, and Equation 6.15 can be written in the following way:

(6.16) 

In the previous equation, E?? ? . Assuming that the average value of ?, ? , is given 

by E?? ?  and that the rock mass is the same in every foundation block, with an average 

Young’s modulus of 10 GPa (assumed in the mechanical model in the green schist area), the 

different curves shown in Figure 6.73 can be due to differences in the horizontal layer’s 

deformability. In dam blocks 8-9 and 19-20, the curves are steeper, therefore the horizontal 

layers of higher permeability are probably in more deformable rock mass areas, with a 

Young’s modulus lower than that assumed. On the contrary, the curves established for dam 

blocks 12-13, 15-16 and 16-17, which are less steep, probably correspond to rock mass areas 

with a higher Young’s modulus. The foundation of dam block 8-9 is probably more 

deformable because it is located close to the area where the green schist meets the phyllite. 

The greater deformability of the foundation of block 19-20 may be explained by the fact that 

it is crossed by 4 faults, as shown in Figure 4.11, which were not treated (faults 8, 9, 10 and 

11).  

The arithmetic mean of the different ? determined in the curves established for the five 

different dam blocks is 1.05, therefore ?  = 10.5. Figure 6.77 shows the estimated Young’s

Taking the highest Young’s modulus as a reference (block 12-13), analysis of Figure 6.77 

leads to the conclusion that the layer in the foundation of block 15-16 is 1.2 times more 

deformable, that in block 16-17 is 1.8 times more deformable, that in block 8-9 is 4.7 times 

more deformable, and that in block 19-20 is 10.2 times more deformable. These results are 

consistent with what is known about the local geology. 

The modulus of deformation of the rock mass is given by: 

skEE
nRRM

111
??  

(6.17) 

where ER is the modulus of deformation of the rock matrix, kn is the fracture normal stiffness, 

and s is fracture spacing. Therefore, when the normal stiffness is very high, the dominant term 

is 1/ER, and when normal stiffness is low, the dominant term is 1/(kn s). It is concluded that, in 

a discontinuum model high normal stiffness values should be considered in descontinuities 

located in the area of the more pervious layers in blocks 12-13, 15-16 and 16-17, and low 

values in blocks 8-9 and 19-20. 

6.7.4.4 Discussion 

The study presented in this section was carried out assuming various hypotheses and 

simplifications which are justified in the following paragraphs. 



   308 

Numerical analysis was carried out assuming that both dam concrete and rock mass behave in 

an elastic linear manner. This constitutive model can be used for dam concrete as the study is 

carried out for moderate loads, corresponding to normal dam operation, which do not lead to 

non-elastic behaviour. In the rock mass, the behaviour is not linear whenever joints open. The 

rock mass was assumed to be isotropic, both from a mechanical and hydraulic point of view. 

However, schist is anisotropic, but there is no data available to characterize the anisotropy. 

Numerical mechanical analysis led to the conclusion that, for the highest reservoir level, the 

normal displacement of the grout curtain/rock mass interface is about 1.5 to 2.5 mm in the 

upper 3 m. In hydraulic analysis carried out in previous chapters, using both detailed and 

global models, permeability of the area of higher permeability upstream from the dam 

simulates a vertical discontinuity with a hydraulic aperture of only 0.18 mm. However, as 

parameter studies have led to the conclusion that changing the assumed hydraulic 

conductivity of this area has limited effect, as long as it is much greater than that of the rock 

mass, no change in the hydraulic model is required. 

Comparison of recorded and numerical results here presented aims to show that the 

geomechanical model developed is quite realistic, simulating the actual dam/foundation 

behaviour reasonably well. A comprehensive study, however, would have to include 

comparison of results obtained at a larger number of points. 

The horizontal displacement at the crest of the central cantilever due to hydrostatic loading 

was compared against results of quantitative interpretation studies. However, numerical 

foundation joint apertures and strains in the foundation rock mass were compared taking into 

account dam monitoring results, which are dependent not only on variations in reservoir level 

but also on variations in ambient temperature, acting simultaneously. More accurate 

comparisons could have been achieved if quantitative interpretation studies had been carried 

out in order to separate and identify each one of the loads’ contributions to the observed 

effects. Due to the large size of foundation blocks below the dam arch, only a rough 

comparison of recorded and numerical strains in the foundation could be made. However, 

strains of the same order as those recorded were determined. 

In the mechanical model, hydrostatic loading was only applied to the upstream face of the 

dam. In order to obtain total stresses, it should have been applied not only to the upstream 

face of the dam but also to the base of the reservoir and on the open area of the grout 

curtain/foundation interface (it should not be applied on the open area of the foundation joint 

because the foundation joint is sealed). These two simplifications have little effect on vertical 

stresses close to the base of the dam, which is what really controls seepage. An alternative 

model, probably more correct, would be to use effective stresses, and in this case the water 

pressures would have to be taken into account in the mechanical analysis. In this study, 



 309 

conclusions were drawn from relative values and therefore are not affected by the above-

mentioned simplification. 

Study of the hydromechanical interaction required a careful selection of recorded discharges, 

in order to use only coherent data. Incoherent field data is due to the fact that discharges 

depend not only on discontinuities’ aperture but also on seepage paths, which may vary with 

changes in the reservoir level or ambient temperature. When these changes occur, a portion of 

the water that flows into the foundation of one of the dam blocks can change its path and flow 

into the foundation of adjacent blocks, as a result of the opening and closure of 

discontinuities. 

The dependency of permeability on local geological features, in addition to dependency on 

stress level, makes it very difficult or even impossible, to have a single ?-k law. 

6.7.4.5 Summary and conclusions 

This section presents a methodology which can be used to establish rules which, from a 

hydraulic model calibrated for a specific water level in the reservoir, allow the calculation of 

discharges for both higher and lower reservoir levels, taking into account that permeability 

depends not only on the stress level but also on local geological features. This simple 

methodology, which uses an uncoupled mechanical-hydraulic analysis, has been applied 

successfully in the analysis of recorded discharges in the foundation of some blocks of 

Alqueva dam.  

Equivalent continuum models were used to carry out both hydraulic and mechanical analysis.  

The simplified global hydraulic model of the dam foundation takes into account the results of 

borehole water-inflow tests and conclusions drawn from detailed 3D models of the area 

around the tests. The main seepage paths were simulated by regions of different permeability. 

The mechanical model here presented allows taking into account the non-linear behaviour of 

both dam joints and interfaces (in this case, foundation joint and grout curtain/rock interface). 

Two areas of different deformability were considered, simulating both the green schist and the 

phyllite regions. 

Due to the influence of local geology, different rules relating stress and permeability were 

established for different foundation areas. There is not a single law representative of the 

whole foundation. Exponential laws were found to fit the considered data well, and these laws 

allow the calculation of discharges for both higher and lower reservoir levels. However, it 

must be borne in mind that this is only valid within the range of the considered water levels. 

In the foundation of one of the dam blocks it could be concluded that flow is mainly 

controlled by a single discontinuity. More accurate relations could have been obtained if a 



   310 

larger amount of reliable data was available. The simplicity of the method presented here 

makes it very useful in the safety assessment of concrete dams. 

The main advantage of carrying out uncoupled hydromechanical analysis is that model 

calibration is easier. Coupled analysis is much more complex and it requires different laws to 

be attributed to the foundation of each dam block. The study was carried out with equivalent 

continuum models, an alternative to which would be to use discontinuum models. This, 

however, would present significant difficulties due to lack of data. In fact, both the position 

and aperture of discontinuities are unknown and, in addition, water flows only through some 

of the discontinuities. The 3D nature of the analysis makes it even more difficult. The issue of 

hydromechanical analysis using discontinuum models with a view to evaluating dam stability 

will be addressed in the following chapter.

6.8 Piezometric measurements in concrete dam foundations 

6.8.1 Introduction 

Piezometers in concrete dam foundations have a twofold aim: the first is to evaluate the 

drainage efficiency in the reduction of uplift pressures, and the second is to measure water 

pressures close to the dam/rock mass interface or in discontinuities within the foundation 

along which sliding may occur. Drainage efficiency is evaluated by using piezometers 

installed upstream and downstream from the drainage curtain, to monitor the head difference. 

Uplift pressures and pressures in discontinuities, which have a destabilizing effect, should be 

measured using small intake areas (Post 1985). However, the majority of the piezometers 

installed in the foundations of Portuguese concrete dams are boreholes drilled in the rock 

mass, with a pipe at the head, fitted with a pressure gauge, and have a long single chamber. In 

fact, there are only six Portuguese concrete dams where multilevel piezometers or 

piezometers with a small intake area were installed:  

- In Funcho dam, a 49 m high arch dam (of which the main characteristics are briefly 

described in sections 2.5.3 and 4.2.5.3), two multilevel piezometers were installed, one 

with two and the other with three different chambers. The foundation consists of schist 

and greywacke. The results of borehole water-inflow tests, which led to a detailed 

knowledge of the main seepage paths, were used to decide where to locate the chambers 

(LNEC 1998b). 

- In Penha Garcia dam, a 25 m high gravity dam located on the River Ponsul, in the 

Castelo Branco district, with a foundation of quartzite, piezometers were installed in 8 

boreholes at two levels. However, the work was not properly done and chambers were 

not isolated from each other, the same water head being recorded in both chambers in 

each of the boreholes. 

- In the stilling basins of both Coimbra and Crestuma dams, several multilevel 

piezometers were installed. These are barrages (gate-structure dams) located on the 

River Mondego, in the city of Coimbra, and on the River Douro, 13 km upstream from 

Porto, respectively. In Coimbra dam there are 20 piezometers in two cross sections, 

which allow measurement of hydraulic heads at different levels, in the upstream-

downstream direction. The gates and the stilling basins transmit the water load to 

flanking piers, which go as deep as 25 to 40 m, to bedrock of marl, crossing nearly 35 m 

of alluvium. In Crestuma dam foundation there are 20 boreholes, each of them equipped 

with three porous ceramic tubes 0.15 m long. Piezometric readings are taken in three 

cross sections. The piers cross 40 m of alluvium to a bedrock of schist. In both dams, 

piezometers are located within the alluvial strata (Pinto and Maranha das Neves 1987). 



   312 

- In Pedrógão dam stilling basin, as mentioned in chapter 4.3.2, there are four multilevel 

piezometers, each with two chambers, whose length varies from 1.5 m to 2.55 m. The 

location and length of each chamber was defined taking into account the boreholes’ logs 

and the results of Lugeon type tests. 

- In Alqueva dam, two piezometric chambers were installed in two boreholes in the 

downstream dam wall. Logs and hydraulic test results, as well as the results of the 2D 

model of a vertical cross section at the bottom of the valley presented in chapter 6.2 

were used to decide the location and length of each chamber (LNEC 2005b). 

As previously mentioned, in chapter 3.3, piezometers accessible to water over their whole 

length take very rough measurements and give only general data which is of limited use 

(Londe 1973b) and are not recommended by the ICOLD (2005), as the water pressure 

measured at the pressure gauge is the result of the inflow and outflow of water from different 

strata or discontinuities which have different hydraulic heads. A numerical study was carried 

out to evaluate the extent to which the water pressures that have been recorded in the 

numerous piezometers located in the foundation of our large concrete dams can be 

misleading.  

The study was carried out using the dimensions of Alqueva dam as reference, with a three-

dimensional model based on the model referred to in chapter 6.3, and includes only three 

boreholes: a piezometer, to which water flows not only through horizontal layers of higher 

permeability between the upstream area and the piezometer, but also through the rock mass, 

and two adjacent drains.  It was first thought that the study could be carried out with an 

axisymmetric model with the axis of symmetry along the axis of the piezometer. However, 

this idea was abandoned, as an axisymmetric model would not take into account the fact that 

seepage takes place in the upstream-downstream direction. The study was progressively 

developed using very simple models and comparing the hydraulic head at the piezometer with 

a long single chamber to the hydraulic heads calculated in more than one chamber. Five 

different possible situations were analysed, sketched in Figure 6.78: 

1. impervious rock mass and a single layer of higher permeability upstream from the 

piezometer, linked to the adjacent drains; 

2. either impervious or pervious rock mass and two independent layers of higher 

permeability upstream from the piezometer, with the upper one linked to the adjacent 

drains; 

3. impervious rock mass, two horizontal layers of higher permeability upstream from the 

piezometer and a link between the piezometer and the adjacent drains at an elevation 

different from those of the horizontal layers;

rock mass; 

5. rock mass with a low permeability, a single layer of higher permeability upstream 

from the piezometer and a link between the piezometer and the adjacent drains at a 

lower elevation. 

In this study, an impervious rock mass simulates a medium with a very low permeability, 

when compared to that of the pervious layers. The horizontal layers of higher permeability 

and the links between the piezometer and the adjacent drains simulate discontinuities through 

which water flows. To obtain a quantitative understanding of the effect of different relative 

permeability values on the readings at the pressure gauge, numerical water pressures along the 

borehole and at the borehole head were determined and compared, for different permeability 

values in each situation. Discharges were also quantified and analysed. 

6.8.2 Model description 

The model used in this study is, as previously mentioned, based on the model referred to in 

chapter 6.3.1, formed by a series of adjacent vertical strips. However, the existence of the 

grout curtain was neglected, and therefore a simpler block division was used below the 

upstream area of the dam base, between the heel of the dam and the drainage curtain. As in 

the numerical analysis of borehole water-inflow tests, presented in chapter 6.4, the model 

includes only three boreholes, the one in the middle being the piezometer. Due to symmetry, 

seepage needs only to be analysed in an area of the foundation with a width corresponding to 

one and a half times the distance between boreholes, thus being only 4.5 m thick. Both the 

piezometer and the adjacent drain are modelled by their axis (diameter zero). The piezometer 

and the drain, both vertical, are assumed to be 25 m long, and are located 10.5 m downstream 

from the upstream face of the dam. It is assumed that the piezometer and the drain are aligned 

in a direction perpendicular to the valley axis. Although piezometers are usually located 

downstream from the drainage curtain with a length of about two thirds of that of the drains, 

this assumption does not affect the validity of the study. 

Horizontal cuts were made upstream from the piezometer and drain, in order to assume the 

existence of horizontal layers of higher permeability, which simulate discontinuities through 

which water flows. These layers are 3.0 m high and are located 3.0 to 6.0 m and 11.0 to 

14.0 m below the upper edge of the model. Vertical cuts in the upstream-downstream 

direction in the above-mentioned horizontal layers were afterwards made, halfway between 

boreholes, so as to assume that the main layers of higher permeability are only upstream from 

the piezometer. 



 315 

Blocks located upstream from the heel of the dam, down to a depth of 14 m were deleted, so 

that the same hydraulic head could be assumed at the upstream face of the horizontal layers. 

This simulates the existence of vertical fissures that come from the heel of the dam, where the 

reservoir head is applied. The model, with about 230.0 × 78.0 × 4.5 m
3
 is divided into 

76 blocks, internally divided into 58085 tetrahedra, with a total of 19773 grid points (Figure 

6.79). The mesh is finer close to both the drain and the piezometer and defined by the average 

edge length of the tetrahedral zones: 0.60 m in blocks adjacent to the piezometer and drain; 

0.90 m in blocks in the vicinity of the above-mentioned blocks; 2.0 m in blocks located 

around the area of interest and 3.0 m in the remaining blocks.  

Figure 6.80 shows the position of the horizontal layers of higher permeability through which 

water flows from the upstream area towards the piezometer, as well as the links between these 

layers and the adjacent drain. The cross section of the more pervious layers upstream from the 

piezometer in a direction perpendicular to that of the flow is 3.0 × 3.0 m
2
, and that of the 

layers linking the piezometer to the adjacent drains is 0.6 × 3.0 m
2
. Each of the following 

areas were considered as a different model region: rock mass, upper layer of higher 

permeability, lower layer, the blocks linking the upper layer to the adjacent drain, and the 

blocks linking the piezometer to the adjacent drain, considered in situations 3 and 5. In this 

way, the permeability of each area could be easily changed. The pervious rock mass 

foundation considered in situations 2, 3 and 5 was assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic 

with a permeability that varied from 0.1 × 10

6.8.3 Hydraulic boundary conditions 

Numerical analysis was carried out assuming the reservoir at an elevation of 143.6 m and the 

water downstream from the dam at an elevation of 81.95 m. A zero pressure was assumed at 

the drain head, which corresponds to a hydraulic head of 61.0 m along the drain borehole. The 

hydraulic head is forced to be constant along each piezometric chamber´s length. 

6.8.4 Results analysis 

In each of the previously mentioned situations, numerical analysis was done in two phases:  

- phase 1: it was assumed that the piezometer was open, i.e. working as a drain, and the 

total discharge was obtained; 

- phase 2: it was assumed that the borehole towards which water flows from upstream 

was closed and both the hydraulic head at the piezometer and the discharge at the 

adjacent drains were analysed. 

In a rock mass of non-uniform permeability, the hydraulic head at the piezometer depends not 

only on the hydraulic boundary conditions but also on the relative permeability values of the 

different model areas. Leakage and seepage velocity, however, depend on the absolute values 

of the different permeabilities (Londe 1973c). In the model presented here, the areas are: the 

rock mass, the upper and lower layers of higher hydraulic conductivity, and the layers linking 

the piezometer to the adjacent drains. 

6.8.4.1 Analysis of discharges and hydraulic heads 

Results of the five situations are presented and analysed below. In order to show the results 

independent of the assumed hydraulic boundary conditions and permeability values, graphs of 

percentage of hydraulic head versus relative permeability values are presented. 



 317 

Situation 1: 

The simple case of seepage towards a single borehole through a horizontal confined pervious 

layer, which is linked to both the adjacent drains, was analysed first. The rock mass was 

assumed to be impervious and a hydraulic conductivity of 5.0 × 10
-7

 m/s was assumed at the 

pervious layer. The permeability of the link between the piezometer and the adjacent drain 

was varied in such a way that the relative permeability of the link and that of the layer was 

zero, 0.04, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0. It was taken into account that, as the cross section of 

the link is smaller than that of the pervious layer upstream from the piezometer, a link 

permeability of 25 × 10
-7

 m/s is required for it to be as pervious as the main layer. Taking into 

account the cubic law (Snow 1965), the layer of higher permeability simulates a rock 

discontinuity with a hydraulic aperture of 0.12 mm. The hydraulic aperture of the link 

between the piezometer and the adjacent drains depends on the link’s assumed permeability. 

Figure 6.81 shows the variation in boreholes’ discharges in both phases of analysis and the 

variation in percentage of hydraulic head at the piezometer, in the second phase of analysis.  

Naturally, in phase 1, central drain discharges decrease and there is an increase in adjacent 

drains’ discharge due to increase in the link’s permeability. With the previously mentioned 

boundary conditions, when the link is as pervious as the main layer, the central drain 

discharge is about half of that when there is no link between the central borehole and the 

adjacent drains.

In the second phase of analysis, with the central borehole (piezometer) closed, the reservoir 

head is obtained at the piezometer when the main layer is not linked to the adjacent drains. 

However, a link with a very low hydraulic conductivity leads to a sudden loss of water 

pressure at the piezometer. When the link is as pervious as the main layer, the water pressure 

at the piezometer is 14.5 % of the hydraulic head. Increasing the link permeability to 

permeabilities higher than that of the main layer does not significantly alter either the water 

pressure at the piezometer or the discharge at the adjacent drains. 

Figure 6.82 shows the hydraulic head contours in a cross-section through the middle of both 

the pervious layer and the link, together with block contours, assuming that the link is 5 times 

less pervious than the main layer (Figure 6.82 a) and as pervious as the main layer (Figure 

6.82 b). Figure 6.83 shows the variations in hydraulic head along two perpendicular lines that 

cross the piezometer in the upstream-downstream direction and along the line of boreholes. 

The variation in hydraulic head in the upstream-downstream direction is linear except close to 

the line of boreholes. Along the line of boreholes, the maximum hydraulic head decreases as 

the link’s permeability increases. 

In the first phase of analysis, when it is assumed that there is no link between the piezometric 

borehole and the adjacent drains, a total discharge of 3.54 × 10

In a 3D model, this is simulated assuming the same hydraulic head at the line of the boreholes 

across 3 m of the model’s thickness, 1.5 m each side of the central borehole. In the model 

presented here, in which the boreholes are simulated by their axis, and the same hydraulic 

head is assumed along the whole borehole’s length, the numerical drain discharge is 

3.14 × 10

/s (1.88 l/min), which is 88.8 % of the above-mentioned result. The study 

presented in chapter 5.2.2, in which seepage in a concrete dam foundation is analysed using a 

two-dimensional horizontal model, led to the conclusion that the total discharge at a drainage 

curtain, with drains of diameter 0.076 m located 3.0 m apart, is 87 % of the total discharge at 

a hypothetical continuous trench with the same depth as the drains. The small difference 

between these percentages is due to the size of the zones around the drain. In fact, around both 

the drain and the piezometer the average edge length of the tetrahedral zones is 0.60 m, while, 

according to the results of both the 2D horizontal model and the 3D model of seepage through 

a horizontal layer presented in chapter 5, it should be around 0.30 m.  Results are coherent, as 

larger zones lead to greater discharges.

In this first situation, as water flows into the piezometer through one or more discontinuities 

located in a confined area, simulated by the main pervious layer, the hydraulic pressure 

measured at the pressure gauge placed at the top of a long single chamber piezometer would 

be the same as that measured in a piezometer with a small intake crossed by the pervious area.

Situation 2:  

The model described in situation 1 with the link between the piezometer and the drain as 

pervious as the main layer was taken as reference, and a new layer of higher permeability was 

considered at a lower depth. Figure 6.84 shows the variations in discharges and in percentage 

of hydraulic head at the piezometer for different permeability values of this layer. In phase 1, 

central drain discharge increases linearly and there is no change in adjacent drains’ discharges 

due to increase in the permeability of the lower layer. When this layer is as pervious as the 

upper layer, the central drain discharge is about 3 times that when there is no lower layer. In 

phase 2, an increase in the lower layer’s permeability leads to a slight increase in adjacent 

drains’ discharge and to a large increase in the percentage of hydraulic head at the piezometer. 

In fact, taking the case when there is no lower layer as reference, adjacent drains’ discharge 

increase around 2.8 times (from 0.98 l/min to 2.71 l/min) when the lower layer is 10 times 

more pervious than the upper layer, and the percentage of hydraulic head at the piezometer 

increases from 14.5 % to 78.6 %. 

Variations in hydraulic head in the middle of the upper layer along two perpendicular lines 

that cross the piezometer in the upstream-downstream direction and along the line of 

boreholes are shown in Figure 6.85. The same figure shows the variation in hydraulic head in 

the middle of the lower layer, in the upstream-downstream direction. Results of two ratios 

between the permeability of both layers are presented: lower layer either 5 times less pervious 

or 10 times more pervious than the upper layer. The upper layer is linked to both the adjacent 

drains, therefore the loss of hydraulic head in this layer is always greater than that in the lower 

layer, as shown in Figure 6.85 a). The same figure shows that the loss of hydraulic head at the 

lower layer is smaller for higher permeabilities of this layer and, therefore, there is an increase 

in the hydraulic head at the piezometer with the increase in the lower layer’s permeability. 

When the permeability of the lower layer is high compared to that of the upper layer, the 

hydraulic head at the upper layer suddenly increases close to the piezometer. Figure 6.85 b) 

shows the variation in hydraulic head along the line of boreholes, in the middle of both the 

upper layer and the link. Figure 6.86 shows the hydraulic head contours in horizontal cuts 

through the middle of the pervious layers. 

In this second situation, if there were two piezometers in the piezometric borehole, each of 

them with a small intake area, one crossed by the upper layer and the other crossed by the 

lower one, the hydraulic head at the piezometer at a lower level would be the same as that of 

the reservoir, while in the upper piezometer the hydraulic head would be 73.0 m, which is 

14.3 % of the reservoir head, as mentioned in the results analysis of situation 1. In a 

piezometer with a long single chamber, the percentage of hydraulic head varies from 14.3 % 

up to a maximum value which depends on the relative permeabilities of the link between the 

piezometer and adjacent boreholes, of both the lower and upper layers. Therefore, in this case,

multilevel piezometers with the piezometric chambers suitably positioned would provide 

valuable information,  as it would be possible to know that there were one or more 

discontinuities located at the lower level linked to the reservoir, with high hydraulic pressures. 

Figure 6.87 shows the variations in discharges and in percentage of hydraulic head at the 

piezometer for different permeability values of the lower layer, assuming that the rock mass is 

pervious, with 5.0 × 10
-8

 m/s of permeability. With a pervious rock mass, the quantity of 

water flowing into and out of the boreholes increases. Therefore, when compared to the 

results obtained with an impervious rock mass (Figure 6.84), discharges are greater and the 

hydraulic head at the piezometer is lower.

kk , assuming a pervious rock 

mass. 

Situation 3:  

New numerical analysis was carried out assuming the link between the piezometer and the 

adjacent drains at mid-way between the pervious layers. The rock mass was assumed to be 

impervious and the permeability of the upper and lower layers was assumed to be 

5.0 × 10
-7

 m/s and 1.0 × 10
-7

 m/s, respectively. The permeability of the link was gradually 

increased and both discharges and water pressures were calculated. Figure 6.88 shows the 

variations in discharges in both phases of analysis and the variation in percentage of hydraulic 

head at the piezometer at the second phase of analysis. In the first phase of analysis water 

flows from the upstream area towards the central borehole through the pervious layers, 

therefore central drain discharge is constant, not dependent on the link’s permeability, and no 

water flows out of the adjacent drains.  In the second phase of analysis, this situation is 

similar to situation 1, in which the amount of water flowing towards the adjacent drains 

gradually increases, and therefore, the curves obtained are similar to those for phase 2 shown 

in Figure 6.81. However, as the link between the piezometer and the adjacent drains is at a 

lower level and there is more water flowing towards the piezometer, discharges and water 

pressures are slightly different.  

This situation was not further analysed as, with this model in which the link is located at mid-

way between the pervious layers, it would not be possible to compare the hydraulic head with 

a single chamber to that with two chambers.

mass. 

Situation 4:  

In situation 4, it is assumed that water flows towards the piezometer through two layers of 

higher permeability and that the piezometer is linked to the adjacent drains by a pervious rock 

mass. This new situation is similar to the previous one, but has the advantage of allowing the 

comparison between piezometric heads in a piezometer with a long single chamber and in two 

piezometers with chambers of different lengths. Variations in discharges in the first phase of 

analysis have already been analysed in similar situations, either by gradually increasing the 

permeability of the lower layer (situation 2) or by gradually increasing the permeability of the 

link between the central and the adjacent boreholes (situation 3), therefore only results of the 

second phase of analysis are presented here.  

It was first assumed that k rock mass = 0.5 × 10
-7

 m/s and k upper layer = 5.0 × 10
-7

 m/s, and the 

permeability of the lower layer was gradually increased. In order to analyse the way in which 

water pressures vary along the piezometric borehole, numerical analysis was carried out 

assuming the piezometer with (Figure 6.89): 

i) a long single chamber; 

ii) two long chambers located 3.0 m apart; 

iii) two long chambers located 5.0 m apart;

iv)  two chambers with a small intake area, defined by the zones where the piezometer 

is crossed by the pervious layers. 

Figure 6.90 shows the variations in discharge and in percentage of hydraulic head at a 

piezometer with a long single chamber. In this case, discharges in the adjacent drains increase 

by around 1.8 times, from 3.1 to 5.66 l/min, when k lower layer/k upper layer increases from 0.1 to 

10, and the percentage of hydraulic head increases from 27.2 % to 66.5 %. A comparison 

between the percentages of hydraulic head at a piezometer with a long single chamber and 

those at chambers of different lengths is shown in Figure 6.91. In this case, the maximum 

difference between percentages of hydraulic head in a long single chamber and in the 

chamber crossed by the most pervious layer is 12.7 %. The greatest differences are obtained 

when two short chambers are considered, because the loss of water through the rock mass is 

smaller. Figure 6.91 a) shows that when the lower layer is as pervious as the upper layer, the 

percentage of hydraulic head in the lower chamber is smaller than that in the upper one. This 

is due to the difference in the chambers’ length. In fact, as the lower chamber is longer, the 

quantity of water flowing out of this chamber is greater, which reduces water pressures. 

Almost the same hydraulic head is obtained in both chambers when they are short. Analysis 

of numerical results with two long chambers located either 3.0 or 5.0 m apart aimed to check 

whether there was a link between both chambers, due to zone sizes. It was concluded that 

isolated chambers are suitably modelled, as almost the same results are obtained in both cases, 

the difference being lower than 0.3 %. 

Figure 6.92 shows the variations in percentage of hydraulic head along the borehole in the 

above-mentioned cases i), ii) and iv), when the lower layer is either 10 times less pervious or 

10 times more pervious than the upper layer. In the first case, the percentage of hydraulic 

head measured with a long single chamber is around the mean value between hydraulic heads 

recorded in both chambers. In the second case, it is closer to the higher hydraulic head, 

recorded in the lower chamber.

Figure 6.92 – Situation 4: hydraulic head along the borehole assuming different piezometers.  

The analysis presented above was repeated assuming different rock mass permeabilities, 

varying from 0.1 to 3.0 × 10
-7

 m/s, and four different ratios between the permeability of the 

lower layer and that of the upper layer:  

i) lower layer two times less pervious than the upper layer ( 5.0?
layerupperlayerlower

kk ); 

ii) lower layer as pervious as the upper layer ( 1?
layerupperlayerlower

kk ); 

iii) lower layer two times more pervious than the upper layer ( 2?
layerupperlayerlower

kk ); 

iv) lower layer twenty times more pervious than the upper layer 

( 20?
layerupperlayerlower

kk ). 

Variations in percentages of hydraulic head for the four different situations at a piezometer 

with a long single chamber are shown in Figure 6.93. Naturally, higher percentages of 

hydraulic head are obtained for rock masses with a low permeability. In this case, percentages 

of hydraulic head of around 57 % to 72 % would be recorded if the permeability of the lower 

layer were not greater than two times that of the upper one. 95 % of the hydraulic head would 

be recorded if the lower layer were 20 times more pervious than the upper.  

Percentages of hydraulic head at piezometers with two either short or long chambers were 

compared to those presented in Figure 6.93, for the above-mentioned cases ii) and iv). Results 



   328 

are shown in Figure 6.94 and Figure 6.95. Figure analysis shows that, in this situation 4, 

readings taken in a piezometer with a long single chamber would be: 

- close to those recorded in both the upper and lower chambers, either short or long, if 

the lower layer is as pervious as the upper one. In this case, the maximum differences 

are of around 10 % and are obtained for a low pervious rock mass (Figure 6.94); 

- between those taken in the upper and lower chambers, closer to readings taken in the 

latter, if the lower layer is 20 times more pervious than the upper. The highest 

differences are obtained when the upper layer is around 10 times more pervious than 

the rock mass (Figure 6.95).

Situation 5:  

In situation 5, it is assumed that water flows towards the piezometer through a layer of higher 

permeability close to the dam/foundation interface, and that there is a link between the 

piezometer and the adjacent drains at a lower level. A rock mass with a low permeability was 

considered (k rock mass = 1.0 × 10
-8

 m/s) and the permeability of the pervious layer was assumed 

to be 5 × 10
-7

 m/s. The permeability of the link between the three boreholes was gradually 

increased. Figure 6.96 shows the variations in boreholes’ discharges and in percentage of 

hydraulic head at a piezometer with a long single chamber. In the first phase of analysis, as in 

situation 3, central drain discharge is constant. An invariable quantity of water also flows into 

the adjacent drains, through the rock mass. In the second phase of analysis, the percentage of 

hydraulic head decreases from 52.4 %, if the piezometer is linked to the adjacent drains by the 

pervious rock mass, to 3.9 %, if the link is 4 times more pervious than the main layer.  When 

the link is as pervious as the main layer, the percentage of hydraulic head is 12.8 %. 

Figure 6.97 and Figure 6.98 show the hydraulic head contours in a vertical cut through the 

piezometer and in horizontal cuts through the middle of both the link and the pervious layer, 

respectively. Figures show that the loss of hydraulic head increases with the increase in the 

link’s permeability.

New numerical analysis was carried out, assuming that the piezometric borehole has two long 

chambers. Figure 6.99 shows a comparison between the percentages of hydraulic head at the 

long single chamber piezometer and in the two long chambers. Results show that, in this case, 

if the permeability of the link is the same as or lower than the permeability of the main layer, 

water pressures lower than 13 % of the hydraulic head will be recorded in a piezometer with a 

long single chamber, while, in fact, the water pressure within the upper discontinuity is about 

66 % of the hydraulic head.

6.8.4.2 Analysis of flow through discontinuity networks 

Hudson and Harrison (2000) suggest a simple method to study seepage in the complex 

discontinuity networks that exist in rock masses, taking into account the continuity equation 

and assuming that the flow in the network is laminar and of low velocity. In this method, the 

hydraulic heads at nodal points are calculated by solving a set of simultaneous equations. An 

equation is established for each node, taking into account that the hydraulic head at each of 

the discontinuity networks’ node depends both on the conductance and on the hydraulic head 

at the beginning of the particular branch of the discontinuities that converge to that node 

(Figure 6.100). Conductance, c, is given by: 

L

ag
c

?12

3

?  
(6.19) 

where g = acceleration of gravity; a = hydraulic aperture of the discontinuity; ? = kinematic 

viscosity of the water, and L = length of the discontinuity in the direction of flow. 

Jing and Stephansson (2007) present a similar procedure to determine piezometric heads at 

discontinuity intersections. They mention that the method can also be applied for unconfined 

flow field, using an iterative procedure with initial head. In this case, a set of additional 

discrete intersection points on fracture segments where the pressure is equal to the 

atmospheric pressure is considered, so that the final geometric location of the water table can 

be obtained.  

The horizontal section shown in Figure 6.101 schematically represents the simple set of 

discontinuities simulated in situation 1, in a 12 m × 9 m rock mass block, with the same 

height as the layers (3 m). On the left hand side, the hydraulic head is the reservoir level (Hu), 

and in both drains is 61.0 m. As seepage occurs in a horizontal level, the solution is 

independent of the elevation head. It is assumed that there is no variation in flow throughout 

the thickness of the rock block. The hydraulic head at the piezometer is the only unknown 

parameter and can be easily obtained, taking into account that the quantity of water flowing 

into the model is the same as the drains’ discharge (continuity equation) and that the flow rate 

in each network branch (1, 2, and 3) is given by Darcy´s law:

. Figure 6.102 shows the 

comparison of the hydraulic head at the piezometer obtained with the 3D model and with the 

simplified model shown in Figure 6.101 (Equation 6.24). This simple model simulates 

seepage very accurately, as differences to the numerical result are lower than 7 %. If the link 

is as pervious as the main layer a hydraulic head of 71.3 m is calculated at the piezometer, 

which is 97.7 % of the numerical result. 

The layer of higher permeability upstream from the piezometer is 3.0 m wide (Figure 6.103), 

therefore the simplified model would be closer to that analysed with 3DEC if an equivalent 

permeability were used in Equation 6.24 in branches 2 and 3, instead of the links’ 

permeability. In this case, the equivalent permeability is given by:

With this second simplified model, the hydraulic head at the piezometer is equal to or lower 

than that calculated with the 3D model, and differences to the numerical result are lower than 

9 % (Figure 6.104).

Figure 6.104 – Comparison of the hydraulic head at the piezometer obtained with the 3D 

model and with the simplified model shown in Figure 6.101 assuming an equivalent 

permeability in branches 2 and 3. 

Although the above-mentioned analysis is for an essentially 2D network, it was also used to 

study flow in the other situations presented here. In these cases, unlike in the situation 

previously described, the elevation head must be taken into account, because the set of 

discontinuities is not horizontal. Hudson and Harrison (2000) highlight that the analysis 

cannot be simply extended into three dimensions because in 3D two discontinuity planes meet 

along an intersection line, along which the hydraulic head may vary. Jing and Stephansson 

(2007) point out that the principle applies also for 3D problems but with much more 

complexity in handling fracture system geometry and connectivity. 

Figure 6.105 shows the set of rock fractures simulated in situations 2, 3 and 5. The mid-level 

of the lower horizontal layer of higher permeability was taken as reference. In this figure, on 

the left hand side of each drawing the pressure head is the reservoir level, and the hydraulic 

head is 61.0 m in both drains. Situation 4, in which it is assumed that water flows towards the 

drains only through the rock mass, was not taken into account. The hydraulic head at each 

node as well as the equations established for each situation are also shown in Figure 6.105. 

Figure 6.106 shows the comparison of the hydraulic head at the piezometer obtained with the 

3D models and with the simplified models shown in Figure 6.105. In situation 2, results are 

compared to those obtained with an impervious rock mass, shown in Figure 6.84. Here, the 

difference between the results of the simplified model and those obtained with the 3D model 

are lower than 12 %. In situation 3, results are very accurate, the difference being lower than 

0.5 %. In situation 5, results are not so accurate when klink / klayer is lower than 0.4. However, 

the difference is lower than 3 % when klink / klayer is greater than 0.4. In this last situation, the 

difference between 3DEC results and those obtained with the simplified model is due to the

fact that the latter does not simulate the permeability of the rock mass. In fact, the 3DEC 

model for situation 5 was run again, this time assuming an impervious rock mass, and the 

results are almost exactly the same as those obtained with the simplified model, as shown in 

Figure 6.107. 

Results show that, in each situation, the hydraulic head at the piezometer, and hence the 

direction and magnitude of flow in each discontinuity segment, can be easily obtained with 

very simple models. These models can be very useful in parameter studies, as they provide a 

very quick means to identify which of the parameters has the greatest influence on the 

hydraulic head at the piezometer. 

6.8.5 Conclusions and discussion 

The majority of the piezometers installed in the foundations of our large concrete dams have a 

long single chamber. Therefore, the water pressure measured at the pressure gauge is a 

weighted average pressure, which depends on the hydraulic head at the various discontinuities 

that cross the borehole. In this study, five different possible situations of water flow patterns 

created by discontinuities crossing the piezometer were analysed. It was taken into account 

that in concrete dam foundations the majority of the flow takes place through discontinuities 

that cross each other and that most of the discontinuities come to an end in another 

discontinuity. 

When the piezometer is crossed by joints through which water flows in a single confined area, 

as in situation 1, the water pressure recorded at the pressure gauge in a piezometer with a long 

single chamber is the same as that recorded in one with a small intake crossed by the 

conductive joints. However, when the piezometer is crossed by conductive joints at different 

levels, as in the other situations analysed, multilevel piezometers with the piezometric 

chambers suitably positioned would provide more useful data. It was found that the most 

serious situation is when water flows into the piezometer at a shallow depth, and flows out at 

a greater depth. In this case, relatively low water pressures can be measured in a piezometer 

with a single long chamber, while high water pressures are found within the discontinuities 

close to the dam/foundation interface, which can affect the dam’s stability.  

The numerical analysis presented here shows that it is difficult to draw generalized 

conclusions concerning the advantages and disadvantages of long or short piezometric 

chambers, as the most appropriate solution depends on local conditions. It has also been 

shown that it is not possible to establish the length of piezometric chambers in advance as 

each situation is different.

Figure 6.107 – Situation 5 assuming an impervious rock mass: comparison of the hydraulic 

head at the piezometer obtained with the 3D model and with the simplified model shown in 

Figure 6.105. 

 



   340 

The positioning and length of the piezometric chambers must be defined case by case and 

should only be specified after obtaining detailed information about the main seepage paths. It 

is not only relevant to know where the piezometric boreholes are crossed by conductive 

discontinuities, but also if and how these discontinuities are linked to adjacent drains. Seepage 

paths, however, can vary with changes in reservoir level or in ambient temperature. It is 

therefore essential that the geology of the area is well understood, and that borehole logs and 

results of Lugeon type tests or borehole water-inflow tests are carefully analysed. At the dam 

site, multilevel piezometers require careful installation, in order to properly isolate the 

chambers. 

Although more detailed data can be obtained with multilevel piezometers, the information 

they provide is very localized, and can be of little value, unless it can be analysed and 

understood by means of a suitable numerical model. In fact, results of equivalent continuum 

models presented thus far show that the hydraulic head varies depending not only on the 

depth but also on the location in relation to the reservoir and to the grout and drainage curtains 

(e.g. upstream or downstream from the grout or drainage curtains, in the line of the drains, or 

in a cross section in the upstream-downstream direction which crosses the drain or which is 

midway between drains). In practice, the complexity of the rock mass jointing pattern and the 

fact that water flows only through some of the discontinuities makes it necessary to take into 

account that piezometric heads can vary significantly from one point to another, even if the 

two points are very close to each other, and therefore, readings may appear incoherent.  

It must be stressed that in the monitoring of concrete dams it is common practice to be 

concerned with water pressures recorded in piezometers located downstream from the 

drainage curtain when the percentages of hydraulic head are greater than around 30 %. 

However, readings taken in piezometers with a long single chamber can be misleading. In 

addition, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, high percentages of hydraulic head may be 

localised and therefore not significant regarding the safety of the dam, or may be of concern, 

when acting on a horizontal discontinuity with a large surface, which encompasses the whole 

base of a dam block. Therefore, when a high percentage of hydraulic head is recorded at a 

piezometer, it is important to know whether there exists a horizontal or sub-horizontal 

discontinuity upon which that pressure is acting (unfavourable to the stability of the dam).  

In the majority of our large concrete dams, there is one piezometer per dam block and drains 

are located 2.5 to 5.0 m apart. In order to understand whether high pressures are localised or 

over a wider area, the drainage system should be used, and some simple tests carried out, 

firstly closing the drains close to the piezometer, and then closing the drains located further 

away: 



 341 

1. if it is localised, when the drains closer to the piezometer are closed, the water 

pressure at the piezometric borehole increases and there is no change in the quantity of 

water that flows through drains located further away from the piezometer. The closure 

of these latter drains causes no change in the piezometric reading. 

2. On the contrary, if there is a horizontal or sub-horizontal discontinuity with a large 

surface where the water pressure is acting, the pressure in the piezometric borehole 

increases when the drains closer to the borehole are closed, as do discharges in 

boreholes located in the vicinity, and increases still further when the drains located 

further away from the piezometer are closed. 

As was seen in chapter 4, valuable additional data can be obtained with borehole water-inflow 

tests and water electrical conductivity analyses.  

High percentages of hydraulic head might be recorded if vertical and/or sub-vertical 

discontinuities parallel to the river axis and with high heads cross the piezometric borehole. 

These water pressures, however, are of no concern to the stability of the dam.  In Alqueva 

dam, as mentioned in chapter 4.5.8.3, the gradual closure of all the drains and piezometers 

located in block 17-18 showed that the high percentage of hydraulic head recorded at drain 

D25 D while carrying out borehole water-inflow tests was localised.  

Finally, regarding the method suggested by Hudson and Harrison (2000) to study seepage in 

complex discontinuity networks, which was used in the simple flow cases presented here, it 

must be mentioned that quite accurate results were obtained. However, the method is very 

difficult to apply in practice, because there is a lack of information about the interconnection 

between conductive joints. 

6.9 Summary and conclusions 

The first model presented in this chapter, which was a simplified 2D model of a vertical cross 

section of the dam foundation, follows the standard practice of assuming that water flows 

from the bottom of the reservoir, goes down around the grout curtain, so that the majority of 

the drained water reaches the drainage boreholes at their lower part. However, seepage in the 

foundation usually differs from the assumed conceptual model as local defects, such as gaps 

in the grout curtain, change the flow path. Seepage as that assumed in the conceptual model 

would only be achieved if the watertight curtain were effective. According to Londe (1973), 

an effective grout curtain must be thick enough, with permeability much lower than that of the 

surrounding rock mass. In a rock mass of low permeability, such as in Alqueva dam 

foundation, reducing the permeability from around 10
-7

 m/s down to 5 × 10
-8

 m/s would be an 

impressive achievement. Therefore, in these cases, it is very difficult to have an effective 



   342 

grout curtain because grout only slightly reduces the natural permeability and, as penetration 

is limited, the curtain is thin.  

The tests and field measurements which were required for the assessment of the main seepage 

paths in an area of the foundation of Alqueva dam were presented in chapter 4. The 

simulations of borehole water-inflow tests carried out provided a good match of recorded 

discharges and water pressures for different experimental conditions. These simulations are 

relevant as the numerical modelling of tests provides a valuable tool for the validation of 

numerical techniques. The models developed are very simple, and only a few parameters were 

used, all of them with physical meaning. The study shows the relevance of knowing where the 

main flow paths are located. Parametric studies carried out showed the importance of 

assigning proper values to both rock mass equivalent permeability and the permeability of the 

layers which simulate the main flow paths. 

The knowledge of seepage patterns around some boreholes provided by test analysis was 

essential to develop an effective application of a simplified global model of the dam 

foundation. Global hydraulic models of dam foundations are useful not only for the 

assessment of the behaviour of dams in use, comparing the average value of discharges and 

uplift pressures with numerical results, but also to determine water pressure distributions to 

take into account in stability analysis.  

Global 3D models of dam foundations, which involve large volumes of rock masses, can only 

be carried out with coarse meshes. In these models, due to zone sizes, the drainage system is 

represented in a simplified way. As previously mentioned, the model was developed taking 

into account the results of borehole water-inflow tests and conclusions drawn from the 

detailed 3D models presented in the previous section. It was concluded that parameters 

determined using the detailed models cannot be used directly in a global 3D model of the 

foundation. In the global model zones are larger, and therefore discharges are greater. 

Comparison of both numerical and recorded discharges and water pressures showed that the 

model can provide mean water pressures and flow rates for each dam foundation block. 

Models of flow in discontinuous rock masses, while representing more closely the physical 

phenomenon, are difficult to apply in many practical cases because of insufficient data on the 

hydraulic properties of the various discontinuity sets. Grouting and drainage add to the 

complexity of flow patterns. However, the analysis presented here shows that the simpler 

equivalent continuum models can be used successfully to model the hydraulic behaviour of 

both large and local areas of dam foundations. In equivalent continuum models bands of 

elements of higher permeability may be assigned to simulate the main seepage paths. These 

layers, located close to the dam/foundation interface, simulated in both the detailed and global 

models of the dam foundation may be justified either by the two sub-horizontal sets of rock 



 343 

joints, shown in Figure 4.10, or by the existence of a more disturbed rock mass zone close to 

the surface, due to excavation works. 

As this study shows, borehole water-inflow tests can be extremely significant in increasing 

knowledge of the hydraulic behaviour of concrete dam foundations. Not only do these tests 

provide additional information to the usual monitoring data, they also make it possible to 

build up a picture of the flow paths and thus, to develop realistic and accurate numerical 

models, which enables more effective assessment of the safety of concrete dams. 

The interdependency between the state of stress and seepage in the foundation of Alqueva 

dam was studied in an uncoupled way, taking into account the results of the hydraulic model 

and those from a global mechanical model. The latter takes into account the two areas of 

different deformability and allows the non-linear behaviour of dam contraction joints and of 

both dam/foundation interface and grout curtain/foundation interface to be taken into account. 

The model was validated by comparing the numerical results with monitoring data. A 

methodology was developed which can be used to establish rules which, from a hydraulic 

model calibrated for specific water levels in the reservoir and downstream from the dam, 

allow the calculation of discharges for both higher and lower reservoir levels, taking into 

account that permeability depends not only on the stress level but also on local geological 

features. 

The study on piezometric measurements presented in the last part of this chapter confirmed 

that multilevel piezometers provide more accurate data than piezometers with a long single 

chamber. However, the most appropriate solution depends highly on local conditions and 

therefore the positioning and length of the piezometric chambers must be defined case by 

case.

7 Analysis of seepage and stability assessment – the case study of 
Pedrógão dam 

7.1 Introduction 

In concrete dam foundations, failure mechanisms are typically defined by natural rock 

discontinuities, the dam/foundation interface or strata with lower strength. Stability analysis 

for scenarios of foundation failure is often based on simplified limiting equilibrium 

procedures. Equivalent continuum models, used in the analysis of seepage presented in the 

previous two chapters, can be employed to assess the safety of concrete dams, complemented 

with interface elements to simulate the behaviour of joints, shear zones and faults along which 

sliding may occur. More advanced analysis, however, is carried out with discrete element 

techniques, which allow the discontinuous nature of rock to be properly simulated, and which 

may include fluid flow through the discontinuities. According to Lemos (1999a) they are 

particularly suitable for stability evaluation of dam foundations, given the importance of 

sliding and/or separation phenomena on natural joints in failure mechanisms. 

This chapter presents a study on seepage in a gravity dam foundation carried out with a view 

to evaluating dam stability. Pedrógão dam was used as reference and the hydraulic behaviour 

in some foundation areas was analysed using both two-dimensional continuum and 

discontinuum models. Firstly, an equivalent continuum model was developed to study 

seepage in a specific cross section of the dam, where the main seepage paths, identified with 

the borehole water-inflow tests presented in chapter 4.4, were represented. A discontinuous 

model of the dam foundation was afterwards developed, using the code UDEC, and a fully 

coupled mechanical-hydraulic analysis of the water flow through the rock mass 

discontinuities was carried out. Due to limited data on orientation and spacing between 

discontinuities within the area being studied, a much idealised fracture pattern was assumed.  

The discontinuum model was used to assess water pressures in the dam/foundation interface 

and along a rock mass horizontal joint of higher hydraulic conductivity, which simulates the 

main flow path. Results of the coupled hydromechanical analysis were compared with those 

obtained with a simple hydraulic analysis, in which the joint hydraulic aperture remains 

constant, and also with those obtained assuming that the drainage system is clogged. Results 

were afterwards compared with those obtained assuming rock masses with different 

equivalent deformability. Variations in discharges due to the filling and subsequent emptying 

of the reservoir were analysed and the influence of joint dilatancy on numerical discharges 

was also investigated. Numerical water pressures were compared with those recorded in situ, 

at the piezometers located underneath the stilling basin.

Discontinuum models which simulate the hydromechanical interaction provide a means of 

assessing the stability of the dam, taking into account the actual shear displacements and 

aperture of discontinuities, and the water pressure pattern within the foundation. The safety 

for different failure scenarios involving the foundation and the dam body was evaluated using 

the discontinuum model developed for this study. The method of strength reduction was used 

to estimate the stability of the dam/foundation system. Analysis was carried out assuming 

different water pressures at the drainage line, including the scenario of a foundation with no 

drainage system. 

7.2 Two-dimensional model of vertical cross sections based on the 
hypothesis of an equivalent continuum media 

7.2.1 Model description 

A two-dimensional model of the foundation of Pedrógão dam was developed to analyse the 

flow in the rock mass and to support the assessment of the field results (Farinha et al. 2007). 

The hydraulic properties of an equivalent continuum are considered and the mesh is based on 

that developed in order to study seepage in Alqueva dam foundation, presented in section 6.2, 

which has the boundaries quite far away from the dam’s area of influence. The mesh was 

modified in the dam area, in order to be adjusted to the length of the dam/foundation interface 

along the upstream-downstream direction, and to the position of both the grout curtain and the 

drainage system. In addition, to take into account the conclusion presented in chapter 6.2.3 

concerning the distance at which boundaries should be placed from the area being studied 

when most of the water flows between the reservoir and the drainage system, zones located 

further away from the dam were assigned zero permeability. In this way, seepage takes place 

in a restricted area of about 200 × 100 m
2
. It is assumed that water flows according to Darcy’s 

law, in a homogeneous and isotropic media. The steady state seepage flow is analysed with 

FLAC 5.0. 

The mesh is made up of 1139 zones, and was developed in such a way that it enables the 

analysis of seepage in different cross sections of the dam, namely in blocks 7-8 and 8-9, of 

which the base is at a level lower than that of the adjacent blocks. The grout curtain is 

simulated by a band of elements 1 m wide. The drains and piezometers are modelled at the 

same position and with the same length as the holes drilled in the foundation. 

A detailed study of the hydraulic behaviour of the foundation of block 6B-7, where the 

highest discharges and percentages of hydraulic head are recorded, was carried out. Taking 

into account the results of water pressure permeability tests performed before the construction 

of the dam in the area under study it is assumed that the equivalent permeability of the rock 

mass is 5.0 × 10
-7

 m/s. The hydraulic conductivity of the grout curtain is assumed to be 



 347 

5.0 × 10
-8

 m/s. The dam body is assumed to be impervious. Figure 7.1 a) shows a detail of the 

mesh below the dam. The study was carried out comparing the numerical results to the 

monitoring data collected on 4 April 2006. On this date, the recorded discharge at the drains 

of block 6B-7 was 2.78 × 10
-5

 (m
3
/s)/m (1.67 (l/min)/m).  

7.2.2 Hydraulic boundary conditions and numerical results 

The lateral and bottom model boundaries are impermeable. The reservoir level is 84.71 m and 

the tailwater level is 60.0 m. Hydrostatic hydraulic heads are applied along permeable 

boundaries: a constant pressure is assigned at the bottom of the reservoir corresponding to a 

water height of 33.71 m and downstream from the dam a constant pressure is assigned 

corresponding to a water height of 0.5 m. Taking into account the high number of piezodrains 

installed in the foundation of block 6B-7, it is not adequate to assume zero water pressure at 

the drains head and therefore the average value of the hydraulic heads recorded at the line of 

the drains (in drains and piezodrains) is assumed at the drainage curtain (65.24 m).  

Taking into account the hydraulic boundary conditions described in the previous paragraph, 

the numerical value of the discharge at the dam drains is about 40 % of the recorded 

discharge. To match the observed values an average hydraulic conductivity of 22.5 × 10
-7

 m/s 

would be needed (4.8 times higher than the assumed equivalent hydraulic conductivity).  

A more accurate model of the foundation of block 6B-7 was developed taking into account 

the existence of tensile stresses at the heel of the dam, due to the filling of the reservoir, which 

lead to the opening of vertical fissures. To simulate these vertical fissures, a band of elements 

of higher permeability was assumed upstream from the grout curtain (Figure 7.1 b). The depth 

of the band of elements is about 20.0 m and the hydraulic conductivity is assumed to be 

10.0 × 10
-7

 m/s. With this model the average discharge at the dam drains is 45 % of the 

recorded discharge. 

Finally, the results of the borehole-water inflow tests performed were taken into account, 

simulating the area where the main seepage paths cross the drains. A horizontal layer of 

higher permeability about 4.5 to 7.5 m down from the drain head was considered, as shown in 

Figure 7.1 c). The hydraulic conductivity of this horizontal layer is assumed to be 

60.0 × 10
-7

 m/s, and therefore the layer, with a height of 3.0 m, simulates a discontinuity with 

a hydraulic aperture of 0.28 mm. The layer crosses the grout curtain simulating a hypothetical 

area of the foundation where the total sealing of discontinuities with very small apertures was 

not achieved. With this model the average discharge at the drain heads, which is 

2.86 × 10
-5

 (m
3
/s)/m, is almost the same as the recorded discharge. The difference in hydraulic 

head at two points located around 7.0 m apart along the horizontal layer of higher 

permeability was used to calculate the quantity of water flowing through that layer. It was 



   348 

concluded that, with this model, around 40 % of the drain discharge is water that flows 

through the layer.  

The numerical discharges with the three models presented in Figure 7.1 and their difference, 

in percentage, to the recorded discharge are shown in Table 7.1. Figure 7.2 shows the 

hydraulic head contours and seepage velocity for the three different models. In the final 

model, the maximum seepage velocity is about 6.5 times higher than in model b) and around 

8.0 times higher than in model a), and therefore, to make the flow patterns visible, the flow 

vectors are not represented at the same scale. Figure 7.2 shows that there are only changes in 

the hydraulic head contours close to heel of the dam, with the exception of model c), in 

which, due to the horizontal layer of higher permeability, the area with a hydraulic head 

between 64.5 m and 66.0 m extends a little further towards downstream. The seepage pattern, 

however, changes significantly in model c), in which the highest seepage velocity and the 

majority of the flow are concentrated in the layer of higher permeability that crosses the grout 

curtain.  

The model shown in Figure 7.1 c) was used to calculate discharges with the reservoir at level 

80.67 m. This level was recorded on 1 March 2006, and the average discharge in block 6B-7 

was 2.43 × 10
-5

 (m
3
/s)/m. It was taken into account that the average value of the hydraulic 

head recorded on that date was 64.12 m. The numerical discharge is only 1 % higher than that 

recorded. 

The model shown in Figure 7.1 a) was afterwards used to study the hydraulic behaviour of the 

foundation of blocks 5-6, 6-6A and 6A-6B. No tests were performed in the foundation of 

these blocks, and therefore it was decided that it would be more adequate to use the simplest 

model developed. Taking into account the results of water permeability tests it is assumed that 

the hydraulic conductivity of the rock mass in this area of the foundation is 1.8 × 10
-7

 m/s. 

The average value of the hydraulic heads recorded at the line of the drains is 59.15 m. The 

numerical value of the discharge at the dam drains is 64 % of the recorded discharge. To 

obtain the recorded discharge, an equivalent hydraulic conductivity of 3.0 × 10
-7

 m/s would be 

necessary (1.7 times higher than the assumed equivalent hydraulic conductivity). 

The study presented here shows that the knowledge of the area where the main seepage paths 

cross the tested boreholes, referred to in chapter 4.4, allowed a more in-depth analysis of the 

foundation area where both the highest discharges and water pressures are recorded, and the 

improvement of the developed numerical model.

7.3 Two-dimensional discontinuum model 

7.3.1 Fluid flow analysis with UDEC 

UDEC performs a fully-coupled hydromechanical analysis, where fracture conductivity is 

dependent on mechanical deformation and, conversely, joint water pressures affect the 

mechanical behaviour (Itasca 2004). Joint apertures and water pressures are updated at every 

timestep. The algorithm is described by Lemos (1987). It is assumed that rock blocks are 

impervious and that flow takes place only through the set of interconnecting discontinuities. 

These are divided into a set of domains, separated by contact points. Each domain is assumed 

to be filled with fluid at uniform pressure and flow is governed by the pressure differential 

between adjacent domains. 

Flow is modelled by means of the parallel plate model, and the flow rate per unit width is thus 

expressed by the cubic law. The flow rate through contacts is given by: 

l

p
akq

j

?

(7.1) 

where kj = a joint permeability factor (also called joint permeability constant), whose 

theoretical value is 1/(12 ?) being ? the dynamic viscosity of the fluid; a  = contact hydraulic 

aperture; l = length assigned to the contact between the domains. The dynamic viscosity of 

water at 20°C is 1.002 × 10

 and therefore the joint permeability factor is 83.3 Pa

. 

In UDEC, the hydraulic aperture to be used in Equation 7.1 is given by: 

aaa ???
0

 (7.2) 

where a0 =  aperture at nominal zero normal stress and a?  = joint normal displacement taken 

as positive in opening. A minimum value, ares, is assumed for the aperture, below which 

mechanical closure does not affect the contact permeability. A maximum aperture, amax, is 

also assumed. Figure 7.3 shows the variation of joint aperture with normal stress, used by 

default in the code UDEC. 

Total stresses are obtained inside the impervious blocks and effective normal stresses at the 

mechanical contacts. The timestep is limited to a value which is proportional to the domain 

volume and inversely proportional to the bulk modulus of the fluid and to joint conductivity 

(Equation 3.3), as explained in section 3.6. In problems in which only the final steady-state 

condition is of interest, the code UDEC is very efficient, as several simplifications are 

possible, which accelerate the convergence to the solution.

7.3.2 Model description 

The discontinuous model of Pedrógão dam foundation developed to analyse fluid flow 

through the rock mass discontinuities is shown in Figure 7.4. A much idealised fracture 

pattern was assumed. Two sets of discontinuities were simulated: the first joint set is 

horizontal and continuous, with a spacing of 5.0 m, and the second set is formed by vertical 

cross-joints, with a spacing of 5.0 m normal to joint tracks and standard deviation from the 

mean of 2.0 m. The former attempts to simulate the sub-horizontal set of discontinuities g) 

and the latter the sub-vertical set b), both of which were referred to in chapter 4 and whose 

average position in relation to the dam is shown in Figure 4.19. An additional rock mass joint 

was assumed downstream from the dam dipping 25° towards upstream, necessary to the 

stability analysis presented in section 7.4.3. The foundation model is 200.0 m wide and 

80.0 m deep. The dam has the crest of the uncontrolled spillway 33.8 m above ground level 

and the base is 44.4 m long in the upstream-downstream direction (Chapter 4.3). In concrete, 

a set of horizontal continuous discontinuities located 2.0 m apart was assumed to simulate 

dam construction joints. The numerical model has 611 deformable blocks divided into 2766 

zones, and 3451 nodal points.  

Both dam concrete and rock mass blocks are assumed to follow elastic linear behaviour, with 

the properties shown in Table 7.2. Discontinuities are assigned a Mohr-Coulomb constitutive 

model, complemented with a tensile strength criterion. In a base run, the mechanical 

properties shown in Table 7.3 were assumed. A construction joint normal stiffness (kn) of 10 

GPa/m corresponds to the assumption that these joints have a width of 3 m of material 

identical to dam concrete. In the rock mass, the assumed kn is an average of laboratory test 

results. A ratio of 0.5 is assumed between normal and shear stiffnesses. Both at the dam 

construction joints and at the concrete/rock mass interface cohesion and tensile strength were 

assigned 2.0 MPa. In rock joints, cohesion and tensile strength are assumed to be zero.

7.3.3 Sequence of analysis 

Analysis was carried out in two loading stages. Firstly, the mechanical effect of gravity loads 

with the reservoir empty was assessed. An in-situ state of stress with an effective stress ratio 

?H/?V = 0.5 was assumed in the rock mass. The water table was assumed to be at the same 

level as the rock mass surface upstream from the dam. Secondly, the hydrostatic loading 

corresponding to the full reservoir was applied to both the upstream face of the dam and 



   354 

reservoir bottom. Mechanical pressure was first applied, followed by fluid flow analysis. In 

both stages, vertical displacements at the base of the model and horizontal displacements 

perpendicular to the lateral model boundaries were prevented. Regarding hydraulic boundary 

conditions, joint contacts along the bottom and sides of the model were assumed to have zero 

permeability. On the rock mass surface, the head was 33.8 m upstream from the dam, and 

5.0 m downstream. 

In order to adjust joint flow properties, the model was first run without grout curtain and with 

no drainage system and the results were compared with those obtained with a FLAC model 

similar to that shown in Figure 7.1 a), but with no grout curtain or drains. The UDEC model 

was slightly changed for this comparison, adopting a regular joint pattern in the whole 

foundation with the rock mass horizontal joint closest to the dam/foundation interface located 

2.5 m away from the interface, instead of 5.0 m. Regular joint patterns do not simulate water 

flow in dam foundations properly because, in reality, discontinuities are not regular. However, 

in this way the UDEC model is more similar to a continuum model. The equivalent 

permeability of the rock mass is assumed to be 5.0 × 10
-7

 m/s, as in the FLAC model. The 

correlation between this and the joint coefficient of permeability, kf , is given by: 

d

f

?

 

(7.3) 

where d is the spacing of discontinuities and:  

?12

f
?

 

(7.4) 

The joint coefficient of permeability is thus 25.0 × 10
-7

 m/s, and the hydraulic aperture of 

discontinuities is 0.1457 mm. Assuming this as a constant aperture in all the discontinuities 

(UDEC disregards the interaction between hydraulic and mechanical effects and performs a 

simple hydraulic analysis if the joint aperture is assigned to ares and (-1) is assigned to a0), the 

quantity of water that flows through the UDEC model (0.77 × 10
-5

 (m
3
/s)/m) is almost the 

same as that in the FLAC model (0.78 × 10
-5

 (m
3
/s)/m). This result may seem incoherent 

because the FLAC mesh is finer and therefore drain discharges should be lower. However, in 

the UDEC mesh, seepage occurs through the domains (in UDEC, a “domain” is a segment of 

a joint, as explained in section 3.6), so the path through which water must flow is longer. 

Longer paths lead to greater losses of hydraulic head and, consequently, to lower discharges. 

In order to analyse seepage in the foundation of Pedrógão dam with the code UDEC a finer 

mesh should be used. For the safety assessment, however, a coarse mesh with an average zone 

size of 5.0 m × 5.0 m is sufficient. 



 355 

The grout curtain was simulated by changing the permeability of the joints in the grouted 

area, in such a way that it is 10 times less pervious than the surrounding rock mass, as in the 

FLAC model. In this latter model the grout curtain was simulated by a band of elements 1 m 

wide. Here, the joint pattern is not regular, and thus the grouted area has different widths at 

different levels. The joint permeability constant at the grouted area was estimated taking into 

account the average width of the grout curtain, which is 3.94 m: as the grout curtain is wider 

than in the FLAC model, the permeability has to be greater. The dam/foundation interface 

was assumed to be two times less pervious than rock joints, because it involves only to 2.5 m 

of rock mass foundation in the vertical direction. At the grouted area, the permeability of the 

dam/foundation interface was also reduced by half. The drainage system was simulated by 

assigning domain water pressures along the drain axis, equivalent to 1/3 of the sum of the 

reservoir and tailwater hydraulic heads. Care was taken in order to define the drainage system 

without including rock mass vertical joints. At this stage of the modelling process, results 

were compared with those obtained with the FLAC model shown in Figure 7.1 a). In this 

latter model, the numerical value of the discharge at the dam drains was about 40 % of the 

recorded discharge whereas in the UDEC model, it is around 49 %. Finally, to simulate the 

main flow path, the horizontal discontinuity located 5.0 m below the dam/foundation interface 

was assumed to be more pervious than the other rock mass discontinuities, in the same area as 

that assumed in the FLAC final model (Figure 7.1 c). In the code UDEC, the permeability of a 

given joint can be changed either by varying the joint aperture, or by multiplying the 

theoretical value of the joint permeability factor (kj) by another factor (?). The latter was used 

in this analysis and thus the joint permeability factor (kj) in the layer of higher permeability 

was adjusted in order for the numerical drain discharge to be the same as that recorded. The 

adjusted joint permeability factor assumed in the various discontinuities is shown in Table 

7.4. 

Hydromechanical analysis was afterwards carried out with the following apertures: 

a0 = 0.1668 mm and ares = 0.05 mm, a0 being the aperture that led to the recorded discharge.

   356 

To take into account the uncertainty in joint normal stiffness, new analysis was carried out 

assuming rock masses with different deformability (kn 5 times higher and 5 times lower than 

that assumed in the base run). Using equation 6.17, the rock mass in which the normal 

stiffness of discontinuities is assumed to be 2 GPa/m has an equivalent deformability of 

5 GPa, that with kn = 10 GPa/m an equivalent deformability of 8.33 GPa and the stiffest 

foundation, with kn = 50 GPa/m, an equivalent deformability of 9.6 GPa (Table 7.5). In every 

run, the same amax and ares were assumed and a0 was that which, in each analysis, led to the 

recorded discharge (a0 = 0.1313 mm for kn = 50 GPa/m and a0 = 0.4287 mm for 

kn = 2 GPa/m). In this way, the same situation is simulated with different models, which 

enables comparison of water pressures and apertures along the base of the dam or along other 

rock mass discontinuities.  

7.3.4 Results analysis 

7.3.4.1 Stresses and displacements due to both rock mass and dam weight  

At the first stage of analysis, stresses due to both rock mass and dam weight were obtained 

(Figure 7.5). Analysis started from a given linear state of stress, close to the in situ state of 

stress due to rock mass weight. It was thus assumed that the vertical in situ stress was the 

weight of the overburden, using the rock mass surface upstream from the dam as the reference 

level, and that the ratio of horizontal to vertical stresses was 0.5. Results show a realistic 

stress pattern with vertical stresses increasing with depth. In foundation blocks close to the 

base of the dam, stresses are higher below the heel of the dam, where an average compressive 

stress of around 0.83 MPa is determined, which is of the same order as that roughly estimated 

due to dam weight (2400 kg/m
3
 × 10 m/s

2
 × 34 m = 0.8 MPa). Displacements at this phase of 

analysis are shown in Figure 7.6. These displacements are only due to the dam weight and to 

the weight of the upper part of the rock mass, downstream from the stilling basin (rock mass 

at an elevation higher than the above-mentioned reference level). The crest of the dam moves 

downwards and towards upstream, with a displacement of 4.3 mm. 

7.3.4.2 Hydrostatic loading  

Principal stresses at the second phase of analysis are shown in Figure 7.7 and displacements 

of the dam/foundation system are shown in Figure 7.8. As expected, stresses on the rock mass 

surface upstream from the dam increase, as do those in the downstream area of the dam close 

to the stilling basin. Below the heel of the dam, close to the dam/foundation interface, stresses 

decrease by around 0.3 MPa, due to dam load and consequent dam rotation towards 

downstream. Gridpoint displacements were reset at the beginning of this loading stage, thus 

displacements shown are due only to hydrostatic loading. At the crest of the dam the 

displacement is practically horizontal and is 1.87 mm.

Figure 7.8– Displacements due to hydrostatic loading. 

7.3.4.3 Fluid flow analysis 

Results of fluid flow analysis both with constant joint hydraulic aperture and taking into 

account the hydromechanical interaction (HM interaction) are shown in Figure 7.9 and Figure 

7.10. In these figures, the line thickness is proportional to the pressure and to the flow rate in 

the fracture, respectively. When the coupling between stress and flow is taken into account, 

domain water pressures are higher in the foundation area upstream from the dam and lower in 

the downstream area, and the maximum water pressure is around 10 % higher (Figure 7.9 a 

and b). Without drainage, domain pressures increase below the dam (Figure 7.9 c). The flow 

pattern in steady-state conditions shows that the majority of the flow is concentrated in the 

first two vertical joints upstream from the heel of the dam, and that this water flows towards 



 359 

the drain, or towards downstream in the foundation with no drainage system, along the joint 

of higher permeability that crosses the grout curtain (Figure 7.10). When the HM interaction 

is taken into account, flow rates are higher at lower levels and a higher quantity of water 

flows into the model through the second vertical joint upstream from the heel of the dam, 

rather than through the first as is the case in the run where joint aperture remains constant. 

This depends on the increase in water pressure in a given vertical joint, which causes the 

closure of adjacent vertical joints. The maximum flow rate is slightly higher when the 

interaction is taken into account (it varies from around 1.21 to 1.25 (l/min)/m). Flow rates 

below 3.0 × 10
-6

 (m
3
/s)/m (0.18 (l/min)/m) are not represented. The quantity of water that 

flows through the model in the analysis with no drainage system and constant joint aperture is 

0.57 (l/min)/m. This increases by around 248 %, to 1.40 (l/min)/m, in the case of the most 

deformable foundation, and decreases by around 26 %, to 0.42 (l/min)/m, in the case of the 

stiffest foundation. Figure 7.11 shows a detail of dam and foundation deformation due to 

a) dam weight and the weight of the upper part of the rock mass, downstream from the stilling 

basin; b) hydrostatic loading and flow; and c) both the above-mentioned effects together. In 

this figure block deformation is magnified 3000 times. 

Figure 7.12 shows the joints that are at shear limit, those with zero normal force or stress and 

the magnitude of joint separation due to mechanical deformation, for the three foundation 

models with different deformability, taking into account the HM interaction. Analogous 

results are shown in Figure 7.13 for the same foundations, this time with no drainage system. 

Figure 7.12 shows that some sliding occurs in the upper part of the rock mass joint dipping 

25° towards upstream, that the number of vertical joints that are at shear limit increases 

towards downstream for stiffer foundations, and, as expected, that joint separation is lower for 

less deformable foundations. In the three different foundation models, the second joint 

upstream from the heel of the dam has an aperture due to mechanical deformation higher than 

the first, because it is linked to the two lower vertical joint tracks in a nearly continuous line, 

as can be seen in Figure 7.4, which makes joint opening easier. Without drainage, the number 

of vertical joints at shear limit and with zero normal force or stress increases towards 

downstream and goes down to deeper foundation areas (Figure 7.13). In this case, the first 

horizontal joint below reservoir bottom, which has an area of higher permeability to simulate 

the main flow path, is at shear limit below the downstream area of the base of the dam.

7.3.4.4 Normal displacements and hydraulic aperture along the dam/foundation joint 

The normal displacement along the dam/foundation joint in both phases of analysis and for 

the different rock masses is shown in Figure 7.14. The jagged shape of the curves is due to 

block rotation, and the magnitude of normal displacement depends on the normal stiffness of 

discontinuities. In the first phase of analysis the point at which the dam/foundation joint 

closes more is below the heel of the dam, due to dam weight, as shown in Figure 7.11 a). In 

the foundation in which the joint normal stiffness is 10 GPa/m, joint closure at this point is 

0.221 mm. Taking this as reference, joint closure is around 3.7 times greater in the most 

deformable foundation, in which kn = 2 GPa/m, and 3.8 times lower in the stiffest foundation. 

In the second phase of analysis, water pressures cause both a decrease in normal 

displacements and an increase in blocks rotation. The peaks like those highlighted with *, 

which are more evident on the chart concerning the stiffest foundation, are due to the 

numerical discretization, because the upper corners of the foundation blocks do not coincide 

with the grid-points of the internal mesh of the dam deformable block adjacent to the 

dam/foundation interface.

Figure 7.15 shows the hydraulic aperture of the dam/foundation joint in the studied situations, 

given by Equation 7.2, with ares as the minimum value. The initial aperture used for each 

foundation is also represented. In the most deformable foundations, the contact at the heel of 

the dam is at ares (0.05 mm), which means that the dam weight is higher than water pressure. 

This does not happen in the same foundations with no drainage system, due to higher water 

pressures.

7.3.4.5 Water pressures along the dam/foundation joint and along the joint of higher 

permeability 

The uplift water pressure along the dam base is always of concern to the stability of concrete 

dams and is usually prescribed in design codes assuming a bi-linear uplift distribution to 

account for the relief drains. The variation of water pressures along the dam/foundation joint 

and along the first horizontal joint below the dam in the area of higher permeability is shown 

in Figure 7.16. Results obtained with the foundations of different deformability are presented. 

In the hydraulic analysis in which the HM effect is not taken into account, variations in uplift 

pressures along both the interface and the foundation discontinuities are the same regardless 

of the foundation deformability, because the joint hydraulic aperture remains constant. Figure 

7.16 shows that variations in water pressures are highly dependent on the pressure on the 

drainage line. Upstream from this line, water pressures are higher for more deformable 

foundations. Downstream from the drainage line, on the contrary, water pressures are higher 

for stiffer rock masses. Along the dam/foundation joint, if all the drains are clogged, the 

highest water pressures are obtained with the stiffest foundation, and the lowest with the most 

deformable rock mass. 

Figure 7.17 shows a comparison of water pressures along the dam/foundation joint with both 

bi-linear and linear uplift distribution, usually used in stability analysis of dams with and 



 367 

without drainage systems, respectively. In the case of drained foundations, the water pressure 

curves are close to the bi-linear distribution. In this case, computed water pressures between 

the heel of the dam and the drainage line are lower than those given by the bi-linear 

distribution, whereas between the drainage line and the toe of the dam they are higher, except 

for the most deformable foundation. In the case of the stiffest foundations with no drainage 

system, calculated uplift pressures are lower than those obtained with the linear distribution, 

to a distance of around 8.0 m from the heel of the dam, and downstream from this point they 

are considerably higher. At the dam/foundation joint end close to the toe of the dam, UDEC 

water pressures are higher than those assumed with the linear distribution of pressures, due to 

the presence of the rock wedge downstream from the dam. For the most deformable 

foundation, the linear distribution of uplift pressures greatly overestimates pressures along the 

base of the dam, with the exception of an area with a length of around 6.0 m, close to the toe 

of the dam. 

7.3.4.6 Joint dilatancy 

Joint dilation is effective when the joint is slipping and can be modelled in different ways. 

The simplest way is by specifying a dilation angle and the dilation increases indefinitely 

irrespective of the joint loading path (Figure 7.18 a). In the UDEC code the normal 

displacement increment due to dilation, is calculated as: 

zdiluifusignuiu
sss

d

n
???? tan

 

zdiluifu
s

d

n
??? 0

 

(7.5) 

where zdil is a parameter that allows the control of maximum dilation. Dilation is zero for 

shear displacements higher than zdil (Figure 7.18 b) and is positive if the shear displacement 

increment (?us) is in the direction of the total shear displacement (us), and negative otherwise. 

As mentioned in Chapter 2, the separation during shear displacement due to dilation causes an 

increase in joint hydraulic apertures and consequently, an increase in joint permeability. 

In the analysis presented in the preceding sections, hydrostatic loading corresponding to full 

reservoir was applied in a single stage. However, due to the non-linear effects, hydrostatic 

loading is better applied in small increments, and therefore, to investigate the dilation effect, 

hydrostatic loading was applied in increments of 5 m. The effect of dilatancy on discharges in 

a loading cycle was analysed, using a dilatancy angle of 10°. In this case, shear displacements 

are small and thus the effect of dilatancy is small. Analysis led to the conclusion that the 

discharge is the same for the full reservoir level in the foundations in which it is assumed that 

kn = 10 GPa/m and ? = 30°. However, if a friction angle (?) equal to 15° is assumed, joint 

sliding increases and thus the dilation effect is more evident (Figure 7.19). However, a friction 

angle of 15° is too low, and not likely to occur in practice.

7.3.5 Comparison of monitored and numerical hydraulic heads at the 

piezometers located underneath the stilling basin 

There are vertical boreholes with two piezometric chambers located in blocks 4B-5, 5B-6, 

6A-6B and 7-8, in the downstream area, underneath the stilling basin (Figure 4.21). Figure 

7.20 shows the hydraulic head in these piezometers plotted versus time. The length of 

piezometric chambers varies from 0.75 m to 2.55 m. Figure analysis shows that the hydraulic 



 371 

head varies with changes in the reservoir level and that it is higher in the piezometric 

chambers located at lower levels, further away from the dam/foundation interface. This 

variation is approximately linear, although readings are widely scattered for the highest 

reservoir levels (Figure 7.21), for which there are more readings.  

The difference between the hydraulic head in the lower chamber and that in the upper one is 

around 0.5 m in block 4B-5, around 0.8 m in block 7A-8, around 2.0 m in block 5B-6 and is 

as high as around 4.5 m in block 6A-6B. Results of both FLAC and UDEC models are 

consistent, showing that the variation in water pressures in the foundation area underneath the 

stilling basin is hydrostatic (i.e. the hydraulic head is the same at points located at different 

levels), and this approximately simulates what is observed in blocks 4B-5 and 7A-8. 

However, the high differences between readings taken in the lower and upper chambers in 

blocks 5B-6 and 6A-6B show that recorded water pressures are mainly dependent on local 

conditions, which are not represented in the model. The following paragraph describes the 

changes introduced into the model in order to try to make numerical results correspond more 

closely to measurements taken in block 6A-6B, where the differences are higher. Figure 7.22 

shows the location of the piezometric chambers underneath the stilling basin in the foundation 

of this block.

 373 

On 4 April 2006, recorded hydraulic heads in block 6A-6B at the lower and upper piezometric 

chambers were 69.9 m and 64.9 m, respectively. An attempt was made to obtain hydraulic 

heads closer to those recorded in this block by changing the developed UDEC model. Firstly, 

as the lower piezometric chambers are located at around 10.3 m below the dam/foundation 

interface, the layer of higher permeability was assumed to be located 10.0 m below this 

interface, instead of the previously assumed 5.0 m. The length of this layer was gradually 

increased, which led to higher water pressures at the downstream area. These varied from 

around 66.1 m to 67.9 m, depending on the layer’s length. However, below the stilling basin 

the variation in pressure remained hydrostatic. Secondly, the permeability of the vertical 

discontinuities was increased 5 times, except in the grouted area, where they remained as 

pervious as the horizontal ones. This decision was made because the model’s vertical 

discontinuities are not continuous, and therefore the rock mass permeability in the vertical 

direction is lower. It was concluded that this increase did not alter the rock mass global 

permeability, because, as vertical joints are discontinuous, water must always flow through 

the set of horizontal discontinuities. Finally, results analysis led to the conclusion that the 

lower hydraulic head recorded at the upper piezometric chambers is almost certainly due to 

leakage through dam vertical joints. To simulate this leakage, the permeability of the 

downstream area of the dam/foundation joint, close to the toe of the dam, was gradually 

increased. However, the maximum numerical difference in water pressures between the lower 

and upper piezometric chambers was 0.8 m (Table 7.6). 

Regarding the model, it was concluded that results closer to those recorded might be obtained 

if it was assumed that the majority of the water flows through sub-horizontal discontinuities 

that are interconnected only in some areas of the dam foundation.

In reality, several springs were identified at the dam site whilst excavating, which are shown 

on the surface foundation map. The water from these springs was collected in two different 

wells, but it was not diverted from the base of the dam to the area downstream from the dam. 

Instead, the wells were covered with a layer of conventional concrete. The water from these 

springs is probably increasing water pressures within the foundation and, consequently, 

increasing the hydraulic head. Since the beginning of the first filling of the reservoir, it has 

been observed that a relatively high quantity of water appears at the downstream sidewall and 

floor of the gallery close to dam vertical contraction joints 4 to 7. The water probably flows 

from the dam foundation through the dam contraction joints, due to misplacement of the 

sealing strips. This can explain the difference in hydraulic head recorded in the lower and 

upper piezometric chambers in some foundation areas. 

7.4 Stability analysis 

7.4.1 Introduction 

For rock foundations, stability analysis requires that possible sliding block mechanisms which 

may lead to failure be identified (ICOLD 1993; Londe 1985). These involve the 

dam/foundation interface, rock mass joints and/or planes of weakness. Wyllie (1999) 

highlights that in general stability conditions are unfavourable if the discontinuities are 

continuous and planar, contain a low strength or brittle infilling and have positions and 

orientations that form a wedge of rock that can slide from the foundation. Instability may 

occur underneath the dam, in the abutments or in adjacent slopes. 

This section starts by briefly describing the main accident scenarios of different dam types 

and the available stability analysis methods for gravity dams. The safety of Pedrógão dam 

against dam base sliding is afterwards assessed with the limit equilibrium method, following 

the Portuguese guidelines for dam design. Water pressures along the dam/foundation joint, 

shown in Figure 7.16, were used to assess the safety of the stilling basin against upsurge. 

Finally, the stability of the dam/foundation system was estimated for different possible failure 

scenarios, using the UDEC model developed and the strength reduction method. 

7.4.2 Main accident scenarios of different dam types 

7.4.2.1 Gravity dams 

The main loads in gravity dams are the self-weight and water pressures (hydraulic pressures 

and uplift). The dam/foundation interface is very large, therefore, uplift pressures at the base 

of the dam and hydraulic pressures play an important role, as they reduce the stabilizing effect 

of the structure weight. Such hydraulic pressures can occur in rock mass discontinuities or 



 375 

even in the dam body, if there is any deficiency in construction joints, or fissures in contact 

with the reservoir. Temperature variations are only important during the construction stage. In 

gravity dams earthquakes can cause various sliding mechanisms in addition to high tensile 

stresses, particularly close to the crest. 

The stresses on the foundations of gravity dams are relatively low so failure of the intact rock 

material is unlikely and the behaviour of the rock mass is controlled by sliding either along 

the dam/concrete interface or along sub-horizontal weak layers in the foundation, close to the 

base of the dam. Depending on the geometrical and mechanical properties of the foundation 

discontinuities and on uplift distribution on those surfaces, other failure scenarios can occur, 

such as overturning around a left abutment/right abutment axis. 

The failure of Austin dam, in the USA in 1911, is an example of concrete gravity dam failure 

due to sliding along a layer of shale, which was the weakest zone in the foundation (Greene 

and Christ 1998). The dam was about 165 m in length and 15 m high. The foundation 

consisted of horizontally layered sedimentary rocks, principally sandstone and shale. Prior to 

concreting, excavation was very shallow and only 1.2 m of shale needed to be excavated to 

reach the sandstone. However, the thickness of the sandstone layer was only 0.6 m, which was 

only discovered after the dam failure. The dam designer had planned a foundation cutoff wall 

that was to be taken to a sufficient depth into bedrock to prevent underseepage, but this had 

not been built. According to Greene and Christ (1998) had the dam´s foundation been taken 

deeper into bedrock, below the shale layer, the dam’s stability would have been significantly 

enhanced.  

7.4.2.2 Buttress dams 

In buttress dams the water load is transmitted to triangular buttresses parallel to the direction 

of the river flow. These resistant elements are isolated blocks, which theoretically work in an 

isolated way, allowing fitting to different geotechnical conditions along the foundation. The 

continuity of the upstream face can be assured either by a thickening of the buttress’ heads or 

by small arches. The spaces between buttresses allow the discharge of water seeping through 

the foundation, thus greatly reducing uplift pressures. The dam/foundation interface is much 

smaller than in massive gravity dams and stresses on the foundation are higher; therefore 

failure scenarios related to block sliding are more likely to occur. Failure scenarios are similar 

to those mentioned for gravity dams, but failure of an isolated block is more likely to occur, 

due to the less effective linking three-dimensional effect and because this type of dam is often 

built in valleys with heterogeneous foundation rock masses. In addition to these failure 

scenarios, problems related to slenderness shall also be taken into account, such as the 

instability of buttresses or connecting structures. 



   376 

7.4.2.3 Arch dams 

Arch dams are curved structures, with their convexity towards upstream, designed to transmit 

water thrust mainly to the abutments and not to the valley bottom, taking advantage both of 

concrete and foundation rock mass compression strength (Veltrop 1988). Therefore, in the 

safety assessment of these dams it is essential to know the maximum stresses and the 

mechanical resistance of concrete and rock mass foundation, particularly in the slopes. In arch 

dams the dam/foundation interface is relatively small when compared to gravity dams and 

uplift pressures do not in general affect safety. However it is of major importance to reduce 

seepage under the dam in order to reduce erosion. The main accident scenarios are: 1) sliding 

along weaker surfaces in the foundation area where the arches rest, particularly in the valley 

sides and in the abutments; ii) crushing of the upper central arch area, where high 

compression stresses can occur and shear scenarios can develop; and iii) seepage in the valley 

bottom, which leads to erosion of discontinuities. 

There are some reported cases of arch dam failure due to the rock mass foundation behaviour 

of which the most well-known case is the failure of the 61 m high Malpasset dam, in France 

in 1959, which is briefly described in chapter 2, section 2.5.3.  

7.4.2.4 Other types of  dams 

In addition to gravity, buttress and arch dams, other types are also built, which combine the 

characteristics of those previously mentioned: arch-gravity, multiple arch and composite 

dams. Arch-gravity dams take advantage of a significant curvature in plan, although they are 

very thick in order to reduce stresses on the foundation. Multiple arch dams consist of a 

number of arches bearing on buttresses and the foundation (Pedro 1977). Multiple arch dams 

of large span are usually built in valleys where the ratio span-height is very large. Composite 

dams include not only the dams with linked concrete and embankment areas but also dams 

which join different types of concrete structures. In arch gravity dams and in large-span 

multiple arch dams the failure scenarios to consider are, basically, the failure scenarios of the 

main types of dams. Therefore, taking into account specific features of each structure, in arch-

gravity dams, failure scenarios associated with both gravity and arch dams must be 

considered, and in large-span multiple arch dams special attention must be given to failure 

scenarios associated with both arch and buttresses dams. In composite dams special attention 

must be given to the part where the different structural areas are linked.  

An example of concrete arch-gravity dam failure is that of the 64 m high St. Francis dam, in 

the USA in 1928. Analysis carried out immediately after the disaster pointed to piping of 

material along a fault, about halfway up the right abutment, as being the cause of failure. 



 377 

Subsequent studies suggested that dam failure involved the partial reactivation of an ancient 

bedrock landslide which comprised the dam’s entire left abutment (Rogers 2006).  

7.4.3 Stability analysis methods for gravity dams 

The limit equilibrium approach has been widely used to evaluate dam foundation stability, 

and considerable experience has been accumulated with its application. The dam is assumed 

to be a rigid body and the method consists of assuming a simplified failure mode and 

calculating the driving and resisting forces acting on the sliding surface, with the ratio of these 

two forces being the safety factor (F). Regarding the stability evaluation of gravity dams, 

different criteria have been adopted by different bodies, and great effort has been made in 

order to analyse the differences in the results (CFBR 2006; European Club of ICOLD 2004a; 

European Club of ICOLD 2004b; FERC 2002; USACE 2000; USACE 2005). These 

differences are mainly related with different ways of simulating the distribution of uplift 

pressures along the base of the dam, the possibility of crack formation and propagation along 

the dam/foundation interface and stability criteria, expressed in terms of either minimum 

values for the safety factors or maximum allowable stresses. A comprehensive computer 

program to perform both static and seismic stability evaluation of gravity dams was 

developed at the École Polytechnique de Montréal, with the aim of providing learning support 

and a basis for research and development on the subject (Leclerc et al. 2003). The program, 

CADAM, which is freely available, includes a large number of modelling options, as it is 

possible to carry out stability analysis using different worldwide published dam safety 

guidelines. 

Two-dimensional analysis is generally adequate for most gravity dams (Rocha 1980a; Rocha 

1980b), though with some exceptions including cases where the dam height is variable along 

its axis and some in which the geotechnical conditions are not uniform (Bustamante and 

Radisic 2006; Lombardi 2007). However, for arch dams 3D analysis is always required, as, in 

this case, failure mechanisms involve intersecting planes which can not be modelled two-

dimensionally. Lemos (1999b) highlights that a significant difference with respect to the 2D 

case is that the failure surfaces for arch dam foundations tend to intercept the concrete 

structure, and various local mechanisms need to be examined. The limit equilibrium method 

allows estimates of the margin of safety to be obtained but does not give an indication of the 

magnitude of shear displacements as instability is approached. Analysis carried out with the 

Finite Element Method (FEM), may be used to estimate both shear deformations and margin 

of safety (e.g. Alonso et al. 1994; Shahkarami et al. 2004; Wittke 1990; Wittke and Polczyk 

2002; Wittke et al. 2003). In this type of analysis, discontinuities along which sliding may 

take place can be modelled using special interface elements. Continuum codes not based on 

the FEM, such as FLAC, can also be used to assess both static and dynamic stability of 

gravity dams (e.g. Bureau 2006). However, stability analysis of dam foundations is better 



   378 

carried out with block models, which may or may not include fluid flow through the 

discontinuities. 

Stability evaluation using the DEM may be carried out applying suitable water pressures on 

potential sliding surfaces, calculated with a simple uncoupled flow analysis, in order to 

provide worst case scenarios (Lemos 1999b).  The reliability of the application of the DEM to 

the study of sliding in jointed rock masses has been proven by comparing numerical results 

with both analytical solutions and experimental data.  Studies which addressed failure of 

gravity dams on multiple discontinuities were carried out, as shown in Figure 7.23 (Pereira da 

Costa et al. 1993; Pereira Gomes et al. 1997; Pina et al. 1993). The collapse mechanism of 

arch dams calculated with 3DEC was also compared with experimental results (Lemos 1999a; 

Lemos 1999b; Lemos et al. 1995). Comparisons for dynamic analysis in seismic failure 

scenarios, using experimental results of a scale model of a gravity dam tested on LNEC’s 

shaking table are presented in Pereira Gomes (2006) and in Lemos and Pereira Gomes (2007). 

Additional data for validation of numerical models for failure scenarios is provided by a series 

of shear tests and shake table sliding tests recently carried out by Rochon-Cyr and Léger 

(2009). 

Stability analysis using discontinuum models that take into account the coupling between 

hydraulic and mechanical effects have been applied mainly for gravity dams. Some of these 

studies are briefly referred to in the following paragraphs. 

Lemos (1987) implemented a series of new features in UDEC necessary for both 

hydromechanical and dynamic analysis of jointed rock masses and studied the behaviour and 

stability of a 100 m high hypothetical gravity dam on a rock mass with 2 joint sets. A 

parametric study was carried out in order to investigate the influence of different factors on 

numerical results. Results of seismic analysis carried out with this model (Lemos and Cundall 

1999) were coherent with results of laboratory experiments which were later carried out by 

Javanmardi et al. (2005a; 2005b) regarding transient water pressures inside a crack created in 

a concrete specimen subjected to a cyclic dynamic movement. 

Mostyn et al. (1997) carried out stability analysis of Chichester gravity dam, located in New 

South Wales, Australia, and the UDEC results were used to assess the accuracy of the Hoek-

Brown empirical rock mass failure criterion. 

Barla et al. (2004) used the code UDEC to investigate the seepage conditions through the rock 

mass foundation of a 73 m high gravity dam in Italy, which was going to be built on a granitic 

foundation, and  to  assess  its  stability. The flow patterns and pressure distributions under the

dam were compared with those usually assumed in static analysis of gravity dams. 

Comparisons of results showed that the safety factors obtained using UDEC were lower than 

those obtained in FLAC analysis, in similar loading conditions.  

Gimenes (2000) and Gimenes and Fernández (2006) performed stability analysis of Albigna 

gravity dam. The dam had a fairly complete foundation monitoring system (Kovari et al. 

1989) which allowed measured field data to be compared with UDEC results. The behaviour 

of both dam/foundation interface and rock mass discontinuities during reservoir filling was 

simulated and the safety of the dam was evaluated for different failure scenarios. 

Concerning the safety factor, several definitions have been proposed as referred to in Kovari 

and Fritz (1989; 1993) and in Alonso et al. (1996). In all cases, it provides a measure of the 

distance from the limit equilibrium, but generally, uncertainty about water pressure 

distribution and shear strength parameters (cohesion and friction angle) along the slip 

surfaces, for the relevant level of normal effective stresses, requires parametric studies to be 

carried out. Two alternative approaches may be employed: partial safety factors and 

probabilistic procedures.  The first allows the consideration of the different levels of 

uncertainty attached to the various actions and material properties (Lemos 1999b), as lower 

safety factors may be used for better defined loads or material properties. This is a semi-

probabilistic approach and is the method prescribed in Eurocode 7 for geotechnical 

engineering (Maranha das Neves 1994). The second would allow us to estimate a probability 

of failure, taking into account the uncertainties in the different parameters (ICOLD 1993). 

However, as discussed in Lemos (1999b), the calculation of probabilities of failure in rock 

engineering presents serious difficulties, mainly due to the usual lack of knowledge 

concerning the probability distribution functions of the material properties, and to our current 

inability to reproduce in numerical models statistical descriptions of the joint patterns. 

Approximate solutions of the probability of failure can be obtained with the reliability 



   380 

analysis method, briefly described in Lemos (1999b), based on simplifying assumptions about 

the distributions of the random parameters involved in the limit state equation. Bernstone et 

al. (2009) have recently used this method to assess the safety of an operating concrete dam, 

taking into account recorded uplift data. 

7.4.4 Stability analysis of Pedrógão dam 

7.4.4.1 Limit equilibrium approach 

In a stability analysis using the limit equilibrium method the loads to take into account are the 

weight of the dam; the reservoir and tailwater loads; uplift water pressures; silt pressures, if 

applicable; and seismic loads. To assess safety against dam base sliding, usual and extreme 

loading combinations were used, as set out in the Portuguese guidelines for dam design (RSB 

2007). Usual combinations encompass different situations which may occur in normal 

operating conditions, while extreme loading combinations cover the conditions that may lead 

to possible failure scenarios. The available shear strength is expressed by a Mohr-Coulomb 

criterion. The peak values of friction angle and cohesion should be used for the usual loading 

combinations, and residual values for the extreme loading combinations. 

The stability analysis was carried out with given minimum shear-friction safety factors at the 

concrete/rock mass interface for the following different hypotheses:  

i) hydraulic head at the drainage line equal to 1/3 of the sum of the reservoir and 

tailwater pressures or dam with no drains (linear distribution of the uplift 

pressure);  

ii) cohesion c in the dam/foundation interface of 0.2 MPa or zero; and  

iii) including and not including the resistance from the rock wedge close to the toe of 

the dam (assuming that downstream from the dam the river bottom is at its actual 

elevation or at the same level as the base of the dam).  

Silt pressure was not taken into account. The following unit weights were used for the 

concrete, foundation rock mass and water: ?c = 24 kN/m
3
; ?r = 25 kN/m

3
; and ?w = 10 kN/m

3
. 

Regarding seismic loads, the same accelerations as those used in the dam design 

(HIDRORUMO 2001) were employed: a = 0.06 g for the Operational Basis Earthquake 

(OBE) and a = 0.143 g for the Maximum Design Earthquake (MDE). For the latter, analysis 

was also carried out with a higher value, a = 0.35 g, which is slightly higher than the 

acceleration for a surface magnitude of 6.0 at a distance of 1 km from a fault with a square 

failure area with sides 7.5 km long (Câmara 2007). The effect of seismic loads is simulated by 

applying two additional external forces to the structure: the first is applied through the centre 



 381 

of gravity of the structure in a downstream direction and is equal to the product of the dam 

weight and a seismic coefficient; the second is the hydrodynamic force exerted by the water 

on the dam. In a first analysis the reservoir is at the level of the spillway crest (84.8 m) and 

the tailwater at level 60.0 m. This is the most probable situation, as the dam has an 

uncontrolled spillway. A second analysis was carried out considering the maximum operating 

level (91.8 m) and a tailwater at level 67.8 m. This situation could arise during a flood. Figure 

7.24 shows the water static loads on block 6-7. 

The hydrodynamic force on the reservoir/concrete interface, which occurs during an 

earthquake, is calculated with the Westergaard simplified model (Figure 7.25). In this model, 

it is assumed that: i) the dam is not deformable; ii) the reservoir is semi-infinite; iii) the water 

is incompressible; iv) the surface waves can be neglected; and v) there are only horizontal 

vibrations along the upstream-downstream direction. The pressure distribution is parabolic 

and the hydrodynamic equivalent force, whose line of action is 0.4 H above the reservoir 

bottom, is added to the static water pressure force to get the total water force on the structure. 

USACE (2005) stresses that it is necessary to be aware of the limitations and the simplifying 

assumptions made with respect to hydrodynamic pressures and their distribution on the 

structure, as this method can lead to significant error. However, if the primary aim of the 

analysis is the foundation behaviour, the model is adequate.

Table 7.7 shows the different loading combinations used in the analysis presented here, and 

Table 7.8 shows the requirements necessary to ensure safety against sliding, according to the 

Portuguese Regulation; with 3.0, 1.5 and 1.2 as minimum safety factors relative to cohesion, 

to the peak friction angle, and to the residual friction angle of the dam/foundation interface, 

respectively. In this table, destabilising actions are shown on the left hand size of each 

formula, while both stabilising actions and the shear resistance, which develops on the 

concrete/rock mass interface, are shown on the right hand side. 

Table 7.9 shows the results of the stability analysis carried out. Although high flow rates and 

uplift pressures are recorded in the foundation of the dam block 6-7, the conclusion is drawn 

that the base sliding stability of the dam is ensured for usual load conditions, when the 

reservoir is at the level of the spillway crest. At the maximum operating level, stability is not 

guaranteed when cohesion of the dam/foundation interface is neglected. For extreme load 

conditions stability is not guaranteed if drains are inoperable. In the case of seismic 

combination using a = 0.143 g, stability is not ensured if drains are inoperable and if the 

resistance from the rock wedge at the toe of the dam is not included in the analysis. If it is 

assumed that the MDE is 0.35 g some shear displacement could occur during the earthquake. 

Therefore it can be concluded that care must be taken in order to maintain the existing 

drainage system in good condition.

Table 7.9 – Minimum values of the friction angle in discontinuities close to the 

dam/foundation interface which ensure safety against sliding. 

 

Analysis shows that the dam is very stable. For the usual scenarios, in which it is assumed 

that cohesion in the dam/foundation interface is not zero, the dam is stable even when the 

drainage system is not operative. For failure scenarios, during a flood, stability is still ensured 

if the drainage system is working properly. This is not the case if the drainage system is 

inoperative, as the calculated friction angles are very high. Thus, in this case, stability is not 

ensured. For the MDE, with the acceleration assumed in the dam design (a = 0.143 g), the 

dam is stable if the drains are operative. For the larger seismic loads (a = 0.35 g), some shear 

displacement could occur. The magnitude of these displacements, however, can not be 

obtained with the limit equilibrium approach. A step by step time domain analysis would be 

required.

Additional analysis was carried out in order to evaluate the stability of the stilling basin of 

Pedrógão dam, which was concreted separately from the dam body, as a series of individual 

blocks, as shown in Figure 7.26. Therefore it is necessary to assess its stability against 

upsurging due to water pressure. Figure 7.16 a) shows the variation in uplift pressures along 

the base of the dam, for different foundations, with and without drainage system. These 

pressures were used to determine the force acting upwards in the area of the stilling 

basin/foundation interface, and this force was compared with the weight of the stilling basin. 

Analysis was carried out for the worst scenario, of foundation with no drainage system (Table 

7.10). Results lead to the conclusion that the stability of the stilling basin against upsurging is 

ensured both when the drainage system is working properly and when there is no drainage 

system but the foundation is very deformable. In situations with no drainage system, stability 

is at its limit in the case of a foundation with joint normal stiffness of 10 GPa/m and is not 

guaranteed in the case of the stiffest foundation.

7.4.4.2 Strength reduction method 

The UDEC model developed, with joint normal stiffness of 10 GPa/m, was used to assess the 

stability of the dam/foundation system for the five different possible failure scenarios shown 

in Figure 7.27. Scenarios a) and e) concern only the dam/foundation joint. Sliding along this 

interface is the most probable failure scenario in dam foundation rock masses containing 

widely spaced discontinuities, none of which are unfavourably oriented. Pedrógão dam is 

embedded in the foundation, and therefore the resistance to sliding is high. Scenario e) 

neglects the resistance of the rock wedge at the toe of the dam, in order to take into account a 

possible excavation downstream, close to the toe of the dam. Scenario b) involves both the 

dam/foundation joint and the rock mass joint dipping 25° towards upstream, which was 

purposely included in the model for stability analysis. This hypothetical situation may 

simulate a combined mode of failure, where the failure path occurs both along the 

dam/foundation interface and through intact rock, in geology where the rock is horizontally or 

near horizontally bedded and the intact rock is weak (USACE 1994). In scenario c), sliding 

along the inclined rock mass joint is prevented, assuming that the behaviour of this joint is 

elastic. Finally, scenario d) concerns sliding through the dam body, along a construction joint.  

Analysis was carried out with the method of strength reduction, typically applied in 

foundation design. The model was first run until equilibrium, then the fluid flow analysis was 

switched off and, for each failure scenario, the friction angle of the highlighted discontinuities 

was gradually reduced until failure (the reduction coefficient was applied to tan ?). Each 

analysis started with the same water pressures, which were obtained assuming the reservoir at 

the retention water level. In cases a), b), c) and e), zero cohesion and zero tensile strength 

were assigned to the dam/foundation joint, involved in the failure mode. In case d), zero 

cohesion was assigned to a dam construction joint, in order to allow sliding and to simulate 

failure along that discontinuity. In this latter case, additional analysis was carried out, which 

consisted of applying a gradually increasing water pressure along the dam joint, instead of 

reducing the joint friction angle. The failure indicator was the horizontal crest displacement. 

Results obtained with an initial friction angle of 35° were compared with those obtained with 

an initial friction angle of 30° (friction angles assumed on rock joints, on the dam/foundation 

joint and on the dam horizontal joints), in order to assess differences in the results due to 

variations in joint shear strength.  With the exception of case d), analysis was also carried out 

assuming no drainage system in the dam foundation. 

Stability analysis results are shown in Figure 7.28 to Figure 7.30, in which, for ease of 

analysis, friction angles in the x-axis are shown in reverse order. The first of these figures 

shows the results of scenarios a), b) and c), which may be compared with one another. In both 

scenarios a) and c) stability was assessed for friction angles as low as around 9.5°, and the 

dam/foundation system remained stable (F &gt; 4.2 for ? = 35° and F &gt; 3.5 for ? = 30°).

Although stable, displacements in scenario a) are considerably higher when the initial friction 

angle is 30°. Displacements are much lower in scenario c), in which sliding along the inclined 

rock mass joint is prevented. Indeed, in this case, it is as if the inclined rock mass joint were 

not there. In scenario a), the presence of this joint can make larger displacements occur. In 

scenario b), with the drainage system operating well, the dam is unstable for friction angles 

lower than around 15° (F = 2.6 for ? = 35° and F = 2.1 for ? = 30°). Without drainage, the 

dam is not stable for friction angles lower than 19° and 21°, for the initial angles of 35° and 

30°, respectively (F = 2.0 and 1.5). In the cases of no drainage system, water pressures are 

higher and therefore the initial elastic displacement is also higher.  

In scenario d), whose results are shown in Figure 7.29, sliding along the highlighted dam 

construction joint only occurs for friction angles lower than around 18° (F = 2.1 for ? = 35° 

and F = 1.8 for ? = 30°). Water pressures can go up to 0.21 MPa, for a joint friction angle of 

35°, and 0.16 MPa, for a joint friction angle of 30°. These water pressures are equivalent to 21 

and 16 m of water column, respectively. The joint along which sliding is being analysed is 

6 m above the reservoir bottom, therefore, when the reservoir is at crest level, there is a water 

column of 27.8 m above the joint, which is higher than the water column that may cause 

sliding. 

Increasing the passive wedge resistance is one of the available methods for increasing gravity 

dam resistance to sliding, and therefore scenario e), in which this resistance is neglected, is 

the most unfavourable of the four analysed failure modes which involve the dam/foundation 

interface. Analysis was carried out assuming that the drainage system is working properly, 

that the water pressure at the drainage line is 60 % of the reservoir head, as that recorded in 

some cross sections of blocks 6-7 and 7-8 (Figure 4.23), and also assuming that the drains are 

all clogged. Stability analysis results for ? = 35° (Figure 7.30) show that the dam is unstable 

for friction angles lower than 22.4°, in the former case (F = 1.7), for friction angles lower than 

around 26°, in the second case (F = 1.4), and is unstable for friction angles lower than 34.5° in 

foundations without drainage system (F = 1.02). 

In scenarios a) and c), if failure were to occur, sliding would be along the dam/foundation 

interface. In scenarios d) and e) failure is obviously along the highlighted discontinuities. 

Scenario b) deserves further analysis in order to understand how the dam/foundation system 

fails. Figure 7.31 shows that close to failure the sliding path is along the base of the dam and 

along the inclined rock mass joint. The interface between the foundation and the downstream 

face of the stilling basin is opened at its upper part, as are the vertical discontinuities which 

intercept this interface. The downstream area of the base of the dam is also opened, as is the 

last vertical discontinuity that meets this interface.

Figure 7.28 to Figure 7.30 show the great influence that water pressure in the drainage line 

has both on horizontal crest displacements and safety factors, as does the joint friction angle.  

Results analysis shows that in all the analysed failure modes involving the dam/foundation

construction joint, sliding begins close to the downstream face of the dam and extends 

towards upstream.

assuming only the case of zero cohesion in the dam/foundation interface. Analysis was done 

assuming either full development of passive pressure, which is improbable as it requires large 

structure displacements, or the development of one-third of the passive pressure, which is 

more realistic. No minimum safety coefficients were considered, in contrast to what was done 

in section 7.4.4.1, in which the limit equilibrium analysis was done according to the 

Portuguese Regulation. Results, presented in Table 7.11, show that the dam is stable when the 

reservoir is at the retention water level, even when the drainage system is inoperative. When 

the reservoir is at the maximum water level, the safety factor is lower than 1 when: i) the 

drainage system is inoperative and the resistance from the rock wedge downstream from the 

dam is neglected (F = 0.69); and ii) the drainage system is inoperative and only one third of 

the passive force is considered in the analysis (F = 0.82).  

Results of the UDEC analysis with the reservoir at both the retention water level and the 

maximum water level are shown in Figure 7.32, Figure 7.33 and in Table 7.12.

interface which ensure safety against sliding and for which failure occurs, and corresponding 

safety factors (failure scenarios shown in Figure 7.27). 

In the four failure scenarios analysed, the dam/foundation system is unstable when the 

reservoir is at the maximum water level and the drainage system is inoperative, and thus these 

situations are not shown in Figure 7.32 and Figure 7.33. For the same reservoir level, in both 

scenarios a) and c) the dam/foundation system remains stable when the drainage system is 

working properly, while in scenario b) failure occurs for a friction angle of around 27.5° 

(F = 1.4) (Figure 7.32). In scenario e), of which the results are shown in Figure 7.33, the dam 

is unstable for friction angles lower than 34.47° when the reservoir is at the maximum water 

level (F = 1.01). 

Table 7.12 shows that, of failure scenarios a), b) and c), the results of scenario b) are the ones 

which can be compared with those obtained using the limit equilibrium analysis. For ease of 

comparison, results presented in Table 7.11 and in Table 7.12 are summarized in Table 7.13.  

Failure mode e) is the only one which enables UDEC analysis to be verified, as the same 

results must be obtained for similar loads with both the UDEC and limit equilibrium analysis. 

Indeed, when the reservoir is at the retention water level and the drainage system is operative 

almost the same friction angles were obtained (21.2° in the limit equilibrium analysis and 

between 21.3° and 22.39° in the UDEC analysis). A difference as low as around 2° is 



   394 

obtained in similar conditions, but with the reservoir at the maximum water level (32.4° in the 

limit equilibrium analysis and between 34.47° and 34.73° in the UDEC analysis). However, 

when the drainage system is inoperative, the friction angles obtained in the UDEC analysis 

(34.21° - 34.47°) are higher than that given by the limit equilibrium method (27.8°). This 

difference can be explained by the higher uplift pressures obtained in the UDEC analysis, 

when compared with those given by the linear distribution of water pressures between the 

reservoir and the tailwater, assumed in the limit equiulibrium analysis. This difference in 

water pressures is shown in Figure 7.34. A limit equilibrium analysis carried out assuming a 

resultant of the uplift pressure 24 % higher than that given by the linear distribution of water 

pressures would lead to the same friction angle at failure as the UDEC analysis (assuming that 

in the UDEC model failure occurs for a friction angle of 34.3°). 

In the analysis in which it is assumed that downstream from the dam the reservoir is at its 

actual level, the UDEC results are within the range of friction angles given by the limit 

equilibrium method, when only part or full passive force is considered, but are closer to those 

obtained for one third passive force. 

7.5 Conclusions 

This chapter presents a study on seepage in Pedrógão dam foundation using both continuum 

and discontinuum models. Information provided from borehole water-inflow tests presented 

in chapter 4 was essential to develop both models. Analysis of seepage using the UDEC 

model, which takes into account the coupled hydromechanical behaviour of rock masses, 

shows that results depend mainly on the joint normal stiffness and on joint aperture. Stability 

analysis was carried out with different assumptions about uplift pressures and joint shear 

strength. Results allowed us to quantify the influence of water pressures on the stability of the 

dam. This result draws attention to the importance of using recorded water pressures for the 

sliding safety assessment of existing dams, as recommended by the European Club of ICOLD 

(2004b).  

Discontinuum models are difficult to apply in most practical cases, because jointing patterns 

are very complex and there is usually a lack of data on hydraulic properties of the 

discontinuity sets. Among these parameters are the orientation and spacing of discontinuities, 

and the hydromechanical characterization data, namely joint normal stiffness, joint apertures 

and residual aperture, which is not readily available. However, such models which simulate 

the hydromechanical interaction are relevant in stability analysis, and the uncertainty in the 

different parameters, can be overcome by performing stability analysis assuming that each 

parameter may vary within a credible range.

   396 

The main limitation of the UDEC fluid flow analysis is that it is carried out in 2D. As flow in 

fractured rock masses is mainly three-dimensional, 2D flow modelling can be highly 

misleading because water can not flow in other directions, out of the plane of the model. 

However, in dam foundations the flow is mainly in the upstream-downstream direction, and 

therefore 2D analysis may be considered adequate in most cases. For arch dams, 3D analysis 

is necessary, but coupled fracture flow modelling of an arch dam foundation would imply 

representing a network of joints from various sets, which would be computationally 

prohibitive. 

In dam stability evaluation, the main advantage of using the 2D code UDEC instead of the 

limit equilibrium method is that it allows the study of a wider range of failure modes. This 

was the case in section 7.4.3.2, in which five different failure modes involving the 

dam/foundation interface, rock joints and a dam construction joint were effectively analysed. 

In addition, UDEC enables displacements to be calculated in seismic analysis, in contrast to 

what happens with the limit equilibrium approach. Stability analysis is also easily done in 3D, 

assuming water pressures obtained with equivalent continuum models. In the case of Alqueva 

dam, presented in the previous chapter, water pressures calculated with the global hydraulic 

model could be transferred to the global mechanical model, in which other interface elements 

could be included, so as to evaluate stability. In 3D, discontinuum models are particularly 

adequate for scenarios of foundation failure, as limiting equilibrium procedures, like those 

proposed by Londe (1973a), make basic assumptions about the forces acting on the 

independent volumes of rock that may become kinematically unstable, and are thus much 

simplified. 

As stated in USACE (2005), advanced analytical analysis, such as that carried out with 

UDEC, can be used to gain a better understanding of structural behaviour. It is, however, 

highlighted that the results obtained from such analysis must be used in conjunction with 

traditional analysis methods, and that the advanced analytical methods can be difficult to 

perform and evaluate. This type of analysis is particularly useful when the foundation 

contains more than one material or is made up of a combination of intact rock, jointed rock 

and sheared rock, as, in these cases, the overall strength of the foundation depends on the 

stress-strain characteristics and compatibility of the various materials. It is also relevant in 

those cases in which controls of maximum displacement, needed to ensure proper function 

and safety, may prevail over safety factor requirements.

8 Conclusions 

8.1 Summary and conclusions 

The main objective of this research was to validate and justify the application of numerical 

models for the analysis of hydromechanical behaviour of concrete dam foundations in normal 

operating conditions. The effective use of these models is necessary to make the analysis of 

the monitoring data and safety control of these structures more efficient. The study explored 

the possibility of using simplified statistical models, traditionally employed in analysis of dam 

displacements, in the analysis of recorded discharges. A series of in situ tests was carried out 

so as to understand the way in which seepage occurs in some areas of the foundation of two 

large concrete dams. Taking into account test results and hydraulic and geomechanical 

characterization of the rock mass, different numerical hydraulic and hydromechanical models 

were afterwards developed to simulate both local and global effects. These models were then 

validated against the flow rates and water pressures recorded in situ.  

The main scientific contribution of this thesis is not only the validation of hypotheses 

assumed in recently developed numerical codes, by comparison of numerical results with both 

experimental and field data, but also the development of methodologies to calibrate models 

for the specific geological and geotechnical conditions of a given dam foundation. This 

research has made relevant contributions in the following areas:  

- the viability of using simplified statistical methods of quantitative interpretation in the 

analysis and prediction of foundation behaviour; 

- the use of in situ tests, particularly borehole water-inflow tests, to complement the 

usual monitoring data; 

- the development of numerical models adequate for the assessment of concrete dam 

foundations’ hydraulic and hydromechanical behaviour in normal operating 

conditions, using available data together with the results of the proposed in situ tests; 

- the application of numerical models for both the simulation of borehole water-inflow 

tests and the analysis of piezometers’ readings; and 

- the assessment of the safety of concrete dams for failure scenarios involving the 

foundation. 

Regarding the viability of using simplified statistical methods of quantitative interpretation in 

the analysis and prediction of foundation behaviour, addressed in the third chapter, a study 



   398 

was carried out to experiment applying methods customarily employed in the analysis of 

mechanical factors in the analysis of discharges. In this study, the shape of the influence line 

of the hydrostatic pressure on discharges in a concrete dam foundation was first established 

with a numerical model that has the required capabilities for simulating the hydromechanical 

process. Using polynomial functions of which the graph adequately follows the shape of the 

above-mentioned influence line, a series of quantitative interpretation analysis was carried 

out. The most significant conclusions were that the effect that variations in reservoir level 

have on discharges is adequately simulated by polynomials of the type h
3
 + h or h

4
 + h, and 

that it is not possible to predict discharges recorded in single drains, as they are largely due to 

local effects and do not represent the permeability of the rock mass. This means that 

discharges recorded in seepage weirs, collected in relatively large areas, rather than 

discharges in single drains should be analysed. The study presented here shows that statistical 

models based on the simplified methods of quantitative interpretation, which can be an 

accurate and powerful tool in the analysis of concrete dam displacements, are not so accurate 

when used in the analysis of the hydraulic behaviour. Although more limited when used in the 

analysis of discharges, this type of method may be useful to approximately predict discharges 

in short periods of time. 

Borehole water-inflow tests, carried out in drains and piezometric boreholes, are introduced as 

an innovative means of obtaining more detailed information on the hydraulic activity in dam 

foundations. These tests, which are conducted with single and double packers, allow 

measurement of discharges and water pressures in isolated sections of the holes. Analysis of 

test results in conjunction with other available information, such as geological and 

geotechnical data of the dam site, boreholes logs and results of other complementary tests, can 

be extremely significant in increasing knowledge of the hydraulic behaviour of concrete dam 

foundations. The information provided by these tests can be used not only to validate 

hydraulic models and to improve numerical models that take into account the existence of 

rock mass discontinuities, but also to choose the best place to locate piezometric chambers or 

to choose suitable remedial or supplementary seepage control measures in areas of the 

foundation where the discharges and/or the uplift pressures are excessive. 

Borehole water-inflow test procedures were established in this thesis, and are presented as a 

basis for other studies. These test procedures were progressively improved during the weeks 

in which tests were carried out in the foundations of two large Portuguese concrete dams and 

proved to be practical and effective. Analysis of water-inflow test results together with data 

recorded with water electrical conductivity analysis and, in some cases, with additional simple 

tests that include closure and opening of boreholes within a given area of the dam foundation, 

proved to be appropriate to obtain knowledge of seepage patterns underneath concrete dams.  



 399 

The tests carried out in both Pedrógão and Alqueva dam led to some conclusions about the 

depth at which the seepage paths cross each one of the tested boreholes, about the distribution 

of discharges and water pressures along the boreholes, and about seepage paths linking 

various boreholes. Results analysis showed that tests are better carried out with both single 

and double packers, as the two sets of results provide different and additional information. 

The simultaneous analysis of water pressures and discharges at each test interval can give 

information about the aperture of the discontinuities through which water flows. The 

knowledge obtained from the use of borehole water-inflow tests and water electrical 

conductivity analysis is relevant when identifying possible failure modes, and can thus help in 

the development of a suitable monitoring programme, which indirectly contributes to a better 

safety assessment of the dam. 

Concerning modelling, different approaches were used to simulate both local and global 

effects and to assess the stability of dam foundations. Modelling was carried out using a step-

by-step procedure, starting from simple models and gradually adding complexity, in order not 

only to detect possible errors in parameters, loads or boundary conditions, but also to make it 

clear how each change in the model affected the numerical outcome. Equivalent continuum 

models with regions of different permeability were employed to analyse both local and global 

effects, as an alternative to discontinuum modelling. Fracture flow models were used in the 

case of the gravity dam, for which the stability for different foundation failure scenarios was 

also evaluated. 

Appropriate ways to represent individual drains were analysed in detail, taking into account 

the computational difficulties of three-dimensional models. In fact, while the drain’s 

cylindrical surface is easily represented in simple 2D meshes, this is not the case in large 3D 

models. The alternative, employed in this study, is to represent the drain as a line, i.e. by its 

axis, however in such cases the mesh around the drain must be carefully selected. Comparison 

of different mesh sizes in this study showed that finer meshes do not improve the numerical 

solution, but tend to amplify the line singularity. Modelling the drain by its axis allows the use 

of coarser meshes which, consequently, leads to shorter run times. Particularly relevant is the 

conclusion that, with the type of elements used in both codes FLAC and 3DEC, when the 

drain is modelled by its axis the optimal size of the elements in the vicinity of the drain is in 

the order of three and a half times the borehole diameter. 

In this study, borehole water-inflow tests carried out in situ were simulated using a detailed 

three-dimensional model which allowed each drain to be modelled individually, taking into 

account the results of rock mass permeability tests and identified areas where seepage paths 

cross each borehole. This detailed 3D model required a fine mesh, and thus, with a view to 

using adequate element sizes and faster analysis, numerical experiments with different meshes 

were carried out, from very fine meshes to coarser meshes. Back-analysis techniques are 



   400 

sometimes used to determine unknown or little-known physical parameters; however, in this 

case, even with the low number of parameters considered in each model, this would have 

presented significant difficulties, namely due to the excessive run-times required. Therefore, 

during the model’s development, a trial-and-error estimating procedure was carried out to 

continually adjust parameters. 

The borehole water-inflow tests provided more details about seepage in the foundation of both 

Alqueva and Pedrógão dams. The simulations of borehole water-inflow tests presented in 

chapter 6 provided a good match of recorded discharges and water pressures for different 

experimental conditions. These simulations are relevant as the numerical modelling of tests 

provides a valuable tool for the validation of numerical techniques. Parametric studies carried 

out showed the importance of assigning proper values to both rock mass equivalent 

permeability and the permeability of the layers which simulate the main flow paths. The 

knowledge of seepage patterns around particular boreholes gained from test analysis was 

essential to develop an effective application of a simplified global model of the dam 

foundation. 

The difficulties in simulating tests carried out in one of the boreholes draw attention to two 

relevant issues, both concerning numerical modelling. The first is the fact that numerical 

results can be highly sensitive to boundary conditions, and therefore great care must be taken 

in order to use the most appropriate boundary conditions for the problem to be solved. In fact, 

it was impossible to simulate results of tests carried out in one of the dam drains until the 

existence of a small leakage through the floor of a gallery located downstream from where the 

tests were carried out was taken into account. This leakage was almost imperceptible, and 

only detectable by personnel with great experience in the task of dam inspection. This fact 

leads to the second relevant issue, that those involved in numerical modelling of test results 

should follow up the tests carried out. This may not be so relevant in tests carried out in the 

laboratory, of which the procedures are well established. However, in tests carried out in situ, 

every detail can be relevant for accurate numerical modelling. Even details concerning the 

equipment and the way tests were carried out can help and be significant in numerical 

modelling of test results. This also applies to the numerical modelling of dam behaviour, 

which means that the modeller always profits from visiting the dam site and carefully 

observing relevant aspects. This greatly helps in choosing appropriate boundary conditions 

and in deciding the relevant aspects to be taken into account and included in the model. 

Global 3D foundation models involve large volumes of the rock masses, thus can only be 

carried out with coarse meshes, in which it is not possible to model each one of the drains. As 

a consequence the drainage system is represented in a simplified way. The study presented 

here shows that modelling the drainage system by a hypothetical continuous trench with the 

same depth as the drains is practical. In this case, if the average value of the hydraulic head at 



 401 

the line of the drains is assumed, the total discharge at the trench is almost the same as the 

total discharge in a 3D model, and the difference in piezometric heads is only significant close 

to the line of the drains. Global models may not be able to simulate local effects but can 

provide mean water pressures and flow rates for each dam foundation block, which is 

significant in stability analysis.  

The interdependency between the state of stress and seepage in the foundation of Alqueva 

dam was studied in an uncoupled way, taking into account the results of global hydraulic and 

mechanical models, which were both validated against monitoring data. A methodology was 

developed that can be used to establish rules which, from a hydraulic model calibrated for 

specific water levels in the reservoir and downstream from the dam, allow the calculation of 

discharges for different water levels, taking into account that permeability depends not only 

on the stress level but also on local geological features. The simplicity of the method makes it 

very useful in the safety assessment of concrete dams.  

Several conclusions are drawn regarding the suitability and limitations of the adopted 

numerical models. Concerning the study of both local and global hydraulic behaviour of dam 

foundations, it is concluded that although discontinuum models provide a more natural 

representation of flow in jointed rock masses, equivalent continuum models can also be used 

successfully. In fact, realistic and efficient models were developed with only a few 

parameters, all of them with physical meaning. These simpler models were employed as an 

alternative to discontinuum modelling and proved to be an effective analysis tool to assess 

concrete dam foundations’ behaviour in normal operating conditions. These models have the 

advantage of making it possible to avoid the difficulties of characterizing the behaviour of 

individual joints and the complications of explicitly representing the discontinuities in large 

models of dam foundations. Hydraulic equivalent continuum models require the permeability 

of the different foundation areas to be properly measured and the main seepage paths to be 

clearly identified. In these models, flow through specific higher conductivity features may be 

approximated, as in this study, with bands of elements of higher permeability. Due to 

uncertainty about geomechanical and hydraulic properties, it is essential to assess the key 

parameters. 

Regarding monitoring of the dam foundation, the in situ tests used in this study (borehole 

water-inflow tests, water electrical conductivity analysis and simple tests that involve the 

closing and opening of drainage and piezometric boreholes) could in future be used in other 

dams as a supplement to the usual seepage information available from drains and piezometers, 

as they allow the assessment of seepage patterns underneath the dam. The numerical study on 

piezometric measurements presented in the last part of chapter 6 highlights the significance of 

using small intake areas to measure uplift pressures or pressures within discontinuities. The 

most appropriate solution for piezometric measurements depends highly on local conditions 



   402 

and therefore the positioning and length of the piezometric chambers must be decided case by 

case, in order to provide the most accurate information. This can be easily done in the 

majority of the Portuguese concrete dams.  

For those whose work involves the modelling of concrete dams, especially arch dams, the 

code 3DEC is particularly suitable to carry out stability analysis, considering some 

discontinuities in the foundation. In this case, failure mechanisms involve the rock mass 

discontinuities and the dam/foundation interface. 3DEC allows the study of the dam-

foundation system, as it allows the modelling of the dam as a shell structure, represented by 

the FEM, and the foundation as a group of blocks. Hydraulic analysis with the code 3DEC 

presented in this thesis was carried out with a new version of the numerical code, which 

allows both equivalent continuum and fracture flow models. The validation of the equivalent 

continuum possibility of this new version, by comparing its results with analytical solutions, 

is relevant as it is very useful to study the hydraulic behaviour of the dam foundation with the 

same code which is used to carry out stability analysis. In mechanical modelling, the 

consideration of a few selected discontinuities is often sufficient to assess the safety 

conditions. Fluid flow analysis of global 3D foundation models based on equivalent 

continuum concepts, like those presented in this thesis, may provide an adequate 

approximation of the water pressures on the discontinuities, necessary for the mechanical 

stability analysis.  

In order to improve current ability to assess the safety of concrete dams for failure scenarios 

involving the foundation, a detailed study on seepage in a gravity dam foundation was carried 

out, using a discontinuum model. While the evaluation of dam behaviour can be done 

accurately with equivalent continuum models, dam stability analysis is better carried out with 

models in which the discontinuities are explicitly represented. The results of these models, 

however, depend mainly on the fracture pattern and on hydromechanical characterization 

data, namely joint normal stiffness, joint apertures and residual aperture. Therefore, stability 

analysis must be carried out assuming that each parameter may vary within a credible range. 

The study presented in Chapter 7 uses the code UDEC, which allows the hydromechanical 

behaviour of jointed rock masses to be accurately simulated. Stability analysis was carried out 

with different assumptions about uplift pressures, joint shear strength and joint hydraulic 

properties. Results allowed us to quantify the influence of water pressures on the stability of 

the dam.

8.2 Further developments 

Concerning the observation and analysis of dam foundation behaviour, additional studies can 

be done, namely quantitative interpretations carried out for different periods of time, 

gradually longer, but using the same functions to represent the two main effects, which could 

be a way of quantifying phenomena such as clogging of the rock mass, and more detailed 

analysis of the results obtained in quantitative interpretations of discharges collected in 

measuring weirs, taking into account that for different reservoir levels the water may be 

collected from a different number of drains. Another area for further investigation concerns 

the hypothesis regarding the fact that in both Alto Lindoso and Alqueva dams, for a given 

water level, the highest discharges are recorded when that level is reached for the first time. 

The suggestion made in this study is that this could be due to the higher rate of variation of 

the reservoir level. 

Further developments in the experimental field include the simplification of test procedures 

and the implementation of an automatic data collection system. Test procedures could be 

simplified, depending on the information required, by taking readings in transient conditions. 

This may significantly decrease the time taken to carry out tests in a large number of cases. 

More detailed and accurate information on variations in water pressures during tests could be 

easily obtained via a data logger linked to a laptop. As a basis for other studies, it would be 

very interesting to have multilevel piezometers or piezodrains continuously monitored by 

automatic recording systems. This would provide valuable data, which analysed in 

conjunction with records of variations in both reservoir level and ambient temperature, could 

provide important information about hydromechanical interaction in some areas of a concrete 

dam foundation.  

Regarding numerical modelling, the procedures presented for analysis of observed behaviour 

by means of global continuum models may be developed in order to represent the 

hydromechanical interaction more consistently. To carry out hydromechanical analysis, an 

iterative procedure may be implemented, as the developed hydraulic and mechanical models 

are essentially the same. It is therefore possible to transfer the uplift and seepage forces 

obtained from the seepage flow analysis to the mechanical analysis. Firstly, the hydraulic 

problem can be solved using initial hydraulic parameters and boundary conditions, which 

provide the seepage and uplift forces. Secondly, the mechanical model may be run and the 

final states of stress and strain allow the new permeability coefficients to be calculated. The 

iterative procedure ends when the difference in displacements and hydraulic heads in 

successive iterations is not significant. As was shown in the case studied, this coupled 

analysis may require different laws to be attributed to the foundation of each dam block. The 

meshes of the hydraulic and mechanical models may not be exactly the same. This is the case 

of the global hydraulic and mechanical models presented in chapter 6, developed for Alqueva 



   404 

dam. It is therefore necessary to develop a procedure to interpolate the different variables 

which have to be transferred from one model to another.  

In this study, stability analysis was carried out only for gravity dams, however these 

procedures can be extended to 3D, for analysis of arch dam foundations or even gravity dams 

with more complex jointing patterns. These more elaborate models will require better 

characterization of both fracture geometry and hydraulic properties. In addition, they will also 

require the application of adequate methodologies and the use of 3D joint generators, 

particularly discrete fracture network (DFN) generators, in order to realistically reproduce 

statistical descriptions of joint patterns. DFN generators for flow simulations in fractured hard 

rocks, which only represent the void space of the connected fractures and exclude the rock 

blocks between the fractures, are practical and have been applied in different engineering 

fields. Their use in 3D in the particular case of dam foundations could be a basis for further 

study. 

Analysis in steady state conditions, such as that presented in this study, is adequate in most 

fluid flow analysis of dam foundations. However, there are circumstances in which the time 

dependent effect transient flow may be important. This was the case in chapter 3, in wich it 

was found useful to determine flow times. However, the small timesteps required by UDEC 

make transient fluid flow analysis impractical in relatively large domains and with very small 

joint apertures, such as those necessary to analyse flow in dam foundations. It is therefore 

necessary to develop new procedures, based on algorithms that use larger timesteps. 

Another field that merits further attention is concerned with the foundation treatment, namely 

regarding characterization, for more accurate modelling. In this study, grouted rock mass 

areas were simulated by regions of lower permeability, of which the width in the upstream-

downstream direction was roughly estimated. According to the Committee on Fracture 

Characterization and Fluid Flow (1996), limited analytical prediction is possible and much of 

the grouting procedure is based on experience and on careful application of the 

adaptable/observational approach. In this regard, in situ permeability tests are usually carried 

out during foundation treatment, before deciding on further grouting, and this gives an 

indication of the permeability of the grouted area. In situ tests, such as those based on 

geophysical methods, for example, may be used to map the spreading of grout in dam 

foundations, for better characterization. Regarding modelling, further analysis of grout flow 

and solidification could be carried out.

Appendix 1 

A1.1 Equipment required to carry out borehole water-inflow tests 

 
1. Borehole checking 

- “blind device” (piece of metal with the same diameter as the equipment to check for and 

remove, if possible, any obstructions, to make sure that the equipment will fit). 

2. Packer 

- a single rubber packer and a double packer with extension pipes (which allow test intervals of 

different lengths); 

- a water pump, to inflate the packer; 

- two flexible inflation hoses, one for water and the other for air; 

- an air pump, to deflate the packers. 

3. Placing and keeping in position the packer in the borehole 

- steel cable, to hold the packer; 

- a cover to close the test interval, with a hook to attach the steel cable; 

- a series of pipes which allow the placing of the packers at the pre-established depth and which 

link the test interval to the borehole head, so that the flow rate into the test interval can be 

measured (in the study carried out, the equipment used to conduct tests has PVC pipes (38 

units 2 m long and 5 units 1 m long), with a diameter of 1’’, a weight per metre of 0.52 kg/m 

and trapezoidal grooves; 

- device to link the packer to the pipes, with a hook to hold the steel cable; 

 - “o-rings” to avoid leaks in the pipes’ joints; 

- vaseline, used to make the “o-rings” more flexible. 



   428 

- adhesive tape or cramps to secure the hoses, the cable that links the pressure transducer to the 

recording device and the steel cable along the pipes; 

- a reel to extend and withdraw the steel cable. 

4. Measurement of discharge and water pressure 

- measuring cylinders, to measure flow rates (of different sizes between 0.125 l and 20 l); 

- a pressure transducer to measure and transmit water pressure data, calibrated for readings from 

0 to the expected maximum water pressure (maximum hydraulic load when the reservoir is 

full), and a cable linking the transducer to the recording device; 

- recording device for the electric transducer; 

- a PVC “T-pipe”, placed at the borehole head, so that the flow rate into the borehole area above 

the test interval can be measured;  

- a metallic “T-pipe”, placed at the borehole head, linked to a spherical valve tap and an outflow 

water pipe, to measure the flow rate into the test interval, and linked to a pressure gauge, 

which measures, at the borehole head, the water pressure at the test interval; 

- precisely calibrated pressure gauges, with scales suitable for the expected maximum water 

pressure in the boreholes which are going to be tested; 

- a depth measure with an electric contact meter to measure static water levels, when water does 

not reach the top of the pipes. 

5. Other 

- pipe-wrenches; 

- a sturdy tripod to hold the pipes while packers are placed in or removed from vertical drainage 

or piezometric boreholes;  

- table and chairs. 

- water conductivity measuring device; 

- borehole TV camera.

A1.3 Test procedures 

 

 
1. Measure water level in the reservoir. 

2. Measure flow rates (l/min) and water pressures (bar), not only in the borehole which is going 

to be tested but also in the drainage and piezometric boreholes located in an area larger than 

that expected to be the borehole’s area of influence (“reference values”). If there is no water 

flowing out of any of these boreholes, measure, with a depth measure with an electric contact 

meter, the static water level. 

3. Insert a piece of metal with the same diameter as the equipment (blind device) into the 

borehole. Measure the borehole’s length. If any obstruction which can not be removed is 

found tests are not carried out in that borehole and are restarted in another borehole where 

tests are planned to be carried out. 

4. Assemble the packer as a  single packer. 

5. Place the single packer, with the aid of the pipes and held by the steel cable, for the test 

interval to be defined between the packer and the bottom of the borehole, with minimum and 

maximum lengths of 1 m and 3 m. The “blind device” is not the same length as the packer; 

therefore, even if it is inserted into the borehole without finding any obstruction, it still 

may not be possible to insert the packer, if the borehole has not been drilled straight. If 

any difficulty is found whilst inserting the packer, it should not be forced through, tests 

are not carried out in that borehole, and the process is restarted in any other borehole where 

tests are planned to be carried out. 

6. Prepare the water pump: i) remove the air from the hydraulic circuit that links the pump to the 

pressure valve; ii) link the hose to the water pump; iii) remove the air from the hose; iv) link 

the water hose to the packer. Link the outflow to the air pump hose (in which the “deflation 

system” is inserted) to the air pump. 

7. Inflate the packer, to seal off the test interval. 

8. Measure the following, in pre-defined time intervals  so as to observe the development until 

steady-state conditions are achieved: 

a. Flow of water into the test interval, if water reaches the pipes’ head. 



   432 

b. The static water level inside the pipes, if water does not reach the pipes’ head.  

c. Water pressure in the test interval, if the packer is equipped with a pressure transducer 

in the test interval (a pressure gauge should be installed at the pipes’ head, to check 

the water pressure recorded by the transducer: the water pressure at the transducer 

must correspond to the water pressure recorded at the pressure gauge plus the weight 

of a water column with a height equal to the distance between the manometer and the 

pressure transducer). 

d. Quantity of water flowing at above the packer (while tests are being carried out this 

borehole’s area works as a drain). If water flowing at above the packer does not reach 

the borehole’s head, use a depth measure with an electric transducer to measure the 

depth of the static water level. 

Measure, after stabilization of the previous values:  

a. Discharges in all the drains located in the vicinity of the borehole being tested (water 

pressure and discharges, in the case of piezodrains). If water does not reach any 

borehole’s head, use a depth measure with an electric contact meter to measure the 

depth of the static water level. 

b. Water pressure in piezometers installed in the vicinity of the borehole being tested. 

c. Taking into account recorded values try to establish the borehole’s area of influence. 

If values have not stabilized after 15 minutes repeat the same measurements every 15 minutes. If after 

an hour values are not stabilized, this test phase ends. If water does not reach the pipes’ head test 

continues from step 11. 

9. Close the test interval, not allowing water to flow out of the pipes. 

10. Measure the following, in pre-defined time intervals so as to observe the development until 

steady-state conditions are achieved: 

a. Test interval water pressure. 

b. Discharge flowing at above the packer. 

Then measure, after values have stabilized:  



 433 

a. Water pressure recorded in piezometers located in the area of influence of the 

borehole being tested. 

b. Water pressures and discharges in piezodrains located in the area of influence of the 

borehole being tested. 

If values have not stabilized after 15 minutes repeat the same measurements every 15 minutes. If after 

an hour values are not stabilized, this test phase ends. 

11. Deflate the packer, allowing a sufficient time interval so that the packer diameter returns to its 

initial value. 

12. Take measurements again in the equipment installed in the area of influence of the borehole 

being tested (to check if reference values are achieved). 

13. Raise the single packer 3 m (so that the same test intervals are considered both with the single 

and the double packer). Measure the water pressure at the recording device before inflating the 

packer. 

14. Repeat steps 7 to 13 until the upper packer reaches the borehole’s head. 

15. Remove the equipment from the borehole. 

16. With the single packer outside the borehole and when steady-state conditions have been 

achieved, measure discharges and water pressures in all the equipment installed in the area of 

influence of the borehole being tested. 

17. Assemble the packer as a double packer with a 3 m long test interval. 

18. Place the double packer, with the aid of the pipes and held by the steel cable, to define the test 

interval at 3 m above the first test interval defined with the single packer. Neither the “blind 

device” nor the single packer used in the previous steps was the same length as the 

double packer, therefore, even if  it was possible to insert the blind device into the 

borehole and carry out tests with the single packer without finding any obstruction, it 

may be not possible to insert the double packer. If any difficulty is found whilst inserting 

the packer, it should not be forced through, tests are not carried out in that borehole, and 

the process is restarted in any other borehole where tests are planned to be carried out. 

19. Repeat steps 6 to 15. 



   434 

20. Remove the double packer from the borehole. 

21. When tests are concluded, with the double packer out of the borehole and when steady state 

conditions have been achieved, measure flow rates and water pressures in all the equipment 

installed in the area of influence of the borehole being tested. 

While tests are being carried out, the time at which measurements are taken should be 

registered.

A1.5 Electrical conductivity of water and temperature profiles 

 

The depth at which the concrete/rock mass interface occurs is shown in gray or green in each 

graph, with the exception of those regarding boreholes where rotary-percussive drilling was 

used because no information is available about the section of the borehole which goes through 

concrete.
