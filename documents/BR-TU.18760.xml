Manganese is one of the most difficult elements to remove from mine waters, due to its high solubility in
both acid and neutral conditions; thus it can be found in quite high concentrations, depending on the
rock’s mineralogy. Metal carbonate precipitation can be an effective way for its removal, as manganese
carbonate has been detected in net alkaline mine waters. However, limestone is effective in removing
manganese only if the metal content is low. This research sought to study manganese precipitation from
high-manganese (140 mL) content mine waters applying sodium carbonate and limestone mixtures. It
was observed that besides the total carbonate concentration, pH plays a key role on manganese
carbonate formation. Provided the pH solution is above 8.5, 99.9% manganese removal can be achieved
with carbonate ions. Although not required for manganese precipitation, limestone acts as a solid
substrate for the nucleation of fine manganese carbonate grains. Infrared spectroscopy showed
manganese carbonate precipitation on the limestone surface. Magnesium was also removed from the
mine water but magnesium carbonate formation was not observed.

1. Introduction

Mining countries have abundant natural resources, which
promotes economic growth and thus wealth (Abraham, 2006).
However, mining and metallurgical processes have the potential to
produce long term environmental impacts as demonstrated by the
Minamata Bay contamination with mercury and the Rio Tinto
Estuary contamination with AMD (Franks et al., 2011).

The application of sustainable development concepts in the
mining industry has long been welcomed because mining activities,
despite affecting relatively small areas, always have environmental
impacts including deforestation, vegetation removal, erosion, and
landscape alteration (Hilson, 2003). Potential sources of pollution
include drainages, air emissions (including particulate matter) and
spills (Driussi and Jansz, 2006). Cyanidation tailings, sulfur dioxide
and acid mine drainage are among the most cited examples of
environmental impacts of the mining sector (Hilson, 2000).

Sustainable development encompasses cleaner production (CP)
and pollution prevention (P2) (Basu and van Zyl, 2006). Hilson
(2000) argues that CP and P2 are different concepts, particularly
in terms of scope. Whereas CP emphasizes change to a wide range
of elements in environmental management, P2 is mainly used to

describe environmental improvements resulting from technolog-
ical changes. Conversely, Basu and van Zyl (2006) includes CP and
P2 in the same umbrella of industrial ecology as a means to achieve
sustainable development in a mining context.

Notwithstanding, either CP or P2 will always be a challenge to
the mining industry (Hilson, 2003), which has a conservative
perspective regarding new technologies. Economic barriers,
derived from the commodity aspect of mine products, small R&amp;amp;D
departments, and the lack of top-level management commitment
to CP are the reasons for such challenge (Moors et al., 2005). It has
been proposed that the nature of the mining operations along with
its unavoidable environmental impacts, make CP concepts difficult
to be applied in the mining context (Hilson, 2003). Nevertheless, CP
in mining can be divided into three different categories: (i) mana-
gerial changes, (ii) policy changes and (iii) physical changes (Hilson,
2003). The first group comprises performing operations with
environmental efficiency, supported by environmental manage-
ment systems. The second is related to decision-making regarding
mining activities, which is carried out through corporate environ-
mental policies and audits. The third includes technological
changes and adoption of state-of-art processes and equipment
(Hilson, 2003). Examples of such aspects include: sustainable
development principles for the disposal of mining wastes (Franks
et al., 2011); new water management policies in mining compa-
nies (Ringwood and Balfe, 2006); different technologies aiming at
waste minimization, treatment and disposal (Franks et al., 2011);

new pyrometallurgical processes with improved sulfur and carbon
sequestration (Moors et al., 2005); and substitution of hazardous
chemicals (Grosse et al., 2003), among others.

Many aspects of CP and P2 are related to mine waters, including
both water management and treatment. This is because the mineral
industry utilizes water for a plethora of activities, such as: pro-
cessing and transport of ores and wastes; mineral beneficiation;
dust suppression; washing; extractive metallurgy operations; and
human consumption (Kemp et al., 2010). Therefore, water release
into the environment is a chief concern both for the industry and
environmental agencies (Driussi and Jansz, 2006). Regulations
throughout the world define standards for water discharge that
must be met by the mining and other industries. These standards
can be very strict regarding toxic metals in mine waters.

Manganese is a toxic element usually found in the effluents of
many industries, as well as in mine waters, either neutral or acid
(AMD). AMD is produced from the oxidation of sulfide minerals as
a result of exposure to both oxygen and water during the mining
and processing of metal sulfides and coal (Sheoran et al., 2010).
Besides manganese, the large content of other elements (mainly
iron, aluminum, sulfate and other dissolved materials during acid
attack on the mining tailings) found in the AMD is also a concern.
Most of these elements can be removed by just increasing drainage
pH, which is achieved usually by lime addition. Since metal solu-
bility is reduced as pH increases, lime is able to reduce metal
concentrations and enables drainage compliance with environ-
mental regulations. Metal sulfide precipitation is also applied to
remove the transition metal elements, since the residual metal
concentrations are very low (Cao et al., 2009; Cohen, 2006).
Nevertheless, neither lime nor sulfide ions are effective in removing
manganese, as this element is soluble over a wide pH range and
very difficult to remove from contaminated waters; requiring pH
above 11 for an effective removal as hydroxide (Ellis et al., 2000).

Mn2þ oxidation and precipitation as MnO2 followed by clarifi-
cation is also an alternative to treat manganese-containing drain-
ages. Chemical oxidation can be performed by aeration or applying
strong oxidizing agents, such as potassium permanganate, hypo-
chlorite or ozone (Silva et al., 2010). Notwithstanding, the presence
of both ferrous iron and organic matter increases oxidant
consumption so that iron removal is required prior to manganese
oxidation (Ghaly et al., 2007; Gouzinis et al., 1998). Biological
processes are an alternative, particularly for low manganese waters
(Burger et al., 2008). The metal can also be precipitated as
carbonate, since manganese-bearing carbonate minerals such as
rhodochrosite (MnCO3) and kutnahorite (CaMn(CO3)2), have been
identified in mine-affected waters; thus materials capable of
releasing CO3

2? or HCO3
? anions have application potential. Kutna-

horite precipitation was detected in mine waters with a high
content of dissolved calcium, magnesium, manganese and CO2 and
its precipitation was enhanced by higher pH values (Hem and Lind,
1994). It is also proposed that dissolved manganese could precipi-
tate as MnCO3, replacing calcium in calcite or co-precipitating with
the latter, provided there is supersaturation with respect to both
calcite and rhodochrosite (Lind and Hem, 1993).

Limestone is the most common neutralizing agent for acid
waters (Douglas and Degens, 2005) due to its availability
(Hammarstrom et al., 2003) and low-cost in many countries and it
is likely to be either the first option for metal removal from many
wastewaters or be combined with other treatment technologies
such as sulfate reduction (Martins et al., 2010). In addition, dis-
solved carbonate is paramount for manganese carbonate forma-
tion; otherwise manganese oxy-hydroxides are produced as
already observed in mine waters (Lind and Hem, 1993). Previous
work on manganese uptake by limestone showed efficient removal
for low to moderate manganese concentrations (16 mg/L), as well
as the presence of manganese carbonate on the limestone surface
(Silva et al., 2010). Bamforth et al. (2006) studied manganese
(w3 mg/L) removal from a mine water with a total alkalinity of
3 meq/L by dolomite, limestone, magnesite and quartzite. Besides
this, the authors observed kutnahorite formation on quartzite
while magnesium-rich calcites were identified in the dolomite and
magnesite reactors, suggesting that the magnesium from the
substrate minerals may have inhibited manganese carbonate
formation. The authors concluded that the nature of the solid
substrate does not affect manganese removal.

When alkalinity is not sufficient for manganese precipitation,
soluble carbonate sources can be added to the reacting system.
Zhang et al. (2010) studied manganese removal with sodium
carbonate (Na2CO3) from effluents produced in hydrometallurgical
operations. From a 1.76 g/L Mn solution at pH 5.9, manganese
precipitation occurred at pH above 7.5, reaching 90% removal at pH
8.0. Higher removals could have been achieved provided the pH
was further increased. In addition, mineral carbonates such as
limestone have been shown to affect the manganese precipitation
pathway, hindering manganese carbonate formation. Accordingly,
the research described herein was undertaken to assess the effects
of both soluble carbonate and limestone on manganese removal
from a mine water with high-manganese content.

2. Experimental

2.1. Materials

A calcite limestone sample assaying 39.5% calcium and 1.23%
magnesium was kindly provided by Brazilian producers. This
sample was first sieved and subsequently dry ground in a vibrating
cup mill (Pulverisette 9, Fritsch) and had its particle size distribu-
tion assessed by laser diffraction (CILAS e 1064), which showed d50
and d90 values of 5.6 mm and 18 mm, respectively. The limestone
surface area (1.52 m2/g) was measured by the N2 adsorption
method (Quantachrome Nova 1000).

2.2. Batch manganese removal experiments

Manganese removal experiments were carried out with
synthetic solutions as well as with mine water. Part of the batch
experiments was performed with calcite limestone mixed with
sodium carbonate (Na2CO3); the other part being performed with
a mixture with either bicarbonate (NaHCO3) or sodium hydroxide.
Synthetic solutions containing 140e2000 mg/L manganese
(MnCl2$4H2O) prepared at pH 2.3e6.5 were studied. The experi-
ments were completed with a mine water sample assaying
140.0 mg/L manganese and at pH 6.5. A volume of 120 mL solution
(synthetic or mine water) was transferred to 250 mL Erlenmeyer
flasks and mixed with different limestone (4.2e20.8 g/L) and
sodium carbonate amounts (0.39e0.92 g/L). The flasks were kept
under agitation (450 min?1), during 90 min, at 23 ? 2 ?C. When the
experiments were finished, the pH value was recorded (Handylab 1,
schott), the solid phase was filtered and the aqueous solution was
analyzed for manganese. The effect of time on manganese precip-
itation was determined in a 2.0 L open Erlenmeyer flask where 1.5 L
manganese solution was mixed with both limestone (12.5 g/L) and
calcium carbonate (0.67 g/L), at pH 6.5 (initial value). This flask was
stirred at 450 min?1, 23 ? 2 ?C and samples were withdrawn at
every 5 min for manganese determination.

2.3. Continuous manganese removal experiments

Continuous experiments were carried out in a stirred reactor
with a 1.67 L capacity, at 23 ? 2 ?C. The latter was fed separately



A.M. Silva et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 29-30 (2012) 11e19 13
with (i) a 140 mg/L manganese-bearing mine water or synthetic
manganese solutions and (ii) a blend made up of limestone (12.5 g/L)
and sodium carbonate (0.67 g/L). One experiment was carried out
with only sodium carbonate (same concentration); that is, in the
absence of limestone. The stirring rate was set at 1200 min?1 and
pumping was provided by two peristaltic pumps (Milan 628); one
feeding the manganese solution at 24.0 mL/min and the second,
a limestoneesodium carbonate blend (4.0 mL/min). Residence time
was set at 60 min and experiments ran for at least 9 resident times
to ensure steady state conditions. After every 60 min, an aliquot
was withdrawn from the reactor, filtered and the manganese
content and pH were determined. The solid residue was preserved
for further analysis (MEV-EDS and FTIR). Prior to and during the
experiments, the mine water was stored in plastic containers at
room temperature.
2.4. Characterization

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the
morphology of the precipitates. The samples were coated with
graphite by electro-deposition, using a JEOL JEE 4C instrument.
They were then investigated by a JEOL JSM 5510 scanning electron
microscope, with an accelerating voltage 0.5e30 kV, equipped with
a spectrometer for micro-analysis based on an energy dispersive X-
ray spectroscopy system (EDS).

Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyzes were carried out in
a Nicolet Nexus 470 model spectrophotometer, equipped with
a Centaurus microscope, an attenuated total reflectance (ATR)
apparatus (Thermo) and a ZnSe internal reflection devise. Medium
infrared measurements were produced with a KBr bean splitter and
an HgCdTe detector. The samples were pressed against a flat glass
surface and mounted under the ATR apparatus. The spectra were
collected in the 400e4000 cm?1 region with a minimum of 32
scans at 4 cm?1 resolution.

The mine water was analyzed, before and during the experi-
ments, for metals by using a Varian 725-ES inductively coupled
plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES), or a Perkin Elmer
AAnalyst 100 atomic absorption spectrometer and the results are
depicted in Table 1. The major constituents were manganese
(140 mg/L), magnesium (90 mg/L) and sulfate (918 mg/L), while the
minor elements were iron (2.2 mg/L), copper (0.22 mg/L) and zinc
(0.78 mg/L).
3. Results and discussions

The CP principles applied to the mine waters included: (i)
reducing the production of contaminated mine waters; and (ii)

recycling and reuse. Specifically, improving effluent quality and
optimizing the treatment process so as to comply with the effluent
regulations, are two of the most applied approaches (Dharmappa
et al., 2000). In this regard, manganese removal is currently one
of the greatest challenges.

3.1. Batch manganese removal

Manganese can be removed from both mine waters and
industrial wastewaters as different compounds and the form of
removal is defined by the water’s chemistry, specially pH and Eh
values. In oxidizing conditions, manganese oxy-hydroxides are
formed, while manganese-bearing carbonate minerals, such as
rhodochrosite (MnCO3) and kutnahorite (CaMn(CO3)2), are
observed to precipitate naturally in the presence of carbonate ions,
if the pH is in the 7e11 range (Fig. 1a). Fig. 1b presents manganese
solubility when considering the precipitation of either manganese
carbonate or hydroxide. Manganese carbonate solubility was
calculated by Equation (1), presented by Lloyd et al. (1983), where
MnHCO3

concentrations were considered.

Equation (1) predicted fairly accurately aqueous manganese

concentrations in equilibrium with manganese carbonate (Lloyd
et al., 1983). Also included in Fig. 1b is the theoretical manganese
hydroxide solubility at 25 ?C and I 1 0. In the presence of
carbonate ions (10?3 mol/L dissolved carbonate) and pH values
above 8, the manganese concentration was reduced to values below
10?5 mol/L. To achieve the same residual concentration, a pH value
of 10 or higher was required when hydroxide precipitation was
used. Therefore, carbonate precipitation ensured lower residual
manganese concentrations in neutral pH values when compared to
metal hydroxide removal. This observation is consistent with the
findings of Dayube and Trindade (2004), who stated that alkalinity
was one of the most cost-effective methods for manganese removal
from mine waters. Another outcome, demonstrated in Fig. 1 was
that carbonate precipitation enabled easier compliance with envi-
ronmental regulations, as most countries define pH 9 as the
maximum allowable value for effluent (or mine water) discharge.

In this work, the approach utilized by Bamforth et al. (2006) was
followed; thereby a combination of limestone and soluble
carbonate sources was studied. Experiments with synthetic solu-
tions were carried out to determine the amount of both limestone
powder (&lt;45 mm) and sodium carbonate required for manganese
removal from a 140 mg/L synthetic manganese solution, which was
the same as the metal concentration in the studied mine water
(Table 1). It can be observed in Fig. 2a, that limestone alone did not
remove manganese effectively at such high concentrations. While
the pH increased to 7.9, the Mn2þ concentration was reduced to
120 mg/L when 25 g/L limestone was applied (Fig. 2a), which was
equivalent to a manganese uptake of 0.98 mg Mn2þ/g-limestone. In
a previous study by Silva et al. (2010), it was found that this was due
to the manganese sorption on calcium carbonate. The authors also
observed a pH increase during manganese removal and similar
manganese uptake (1.28 mg Mn2þ/g-limestone).

Unlike powdered limestone, sodium carbonate precipitated
manganese extensively (Fig. 2b), as expected. In the presence of
0.67 g/L sodium carbonate, the solution’s pH reached 9.6 and the
manganese concentration was reduced to values below the detec-
tion limit with the synthetic solution. Lower carbonate concen-
trations produced lower final pH values and thus higher residual
manganese concentrations in the aqueous phase as demonstrated
in Fig. 1b. These results are consistent with the studies carried out
by Zhang et al. (2010) during manganese removal from effluents
produced in hydrometallurgical operations, which also observed
that a pH value above 8.0 was needed to produce residual
manganese concentrations below 1 mg/L. Similarly, Costa (2006)
observed smaller residual manganese concentrations for
increasing pH values.

The effect of time on manganese removal is shown in Fig. 3 for
experiments comprising the application of different carbonate
sources or sodium hydroxide. It can be observed that 12.5 g/L
limestone reduces the manganese concentration to 124 mg/L,
within 100 min; that is, only 11% of the manganese was removed
from the solution. When stoichiometrical concentrations of sodium
bicarbonate (0.21 g/L) were mixed with a 140 mg/L manganese
solution in the absence of limestone, only a minor effect on met-
al removal (15%) was noticed and the final manganese concentra-
tion reached 120 mg/L, which was similar to the value observed
when only calcium carbonate was applied. When the NaHCO3
concentration increased to 0.67 mg/L, manganese concentration
reduced to 81.8 mg/L for a final pH value of 8.0. This behavior
should be compared to the experiments carried out with sodium
carbonate (Fig. 4). With 0.26 g/L Na2CO3 (stoichiometrical amount

to precipitate 140 mg/L Mn2þ) and in the absence of limestone
powder, the removal efficiency was improved to 47% and the
manganese concentration was reduced to 74.7 mg/L. For the
optimum value defined in Fig. 2b (0.67 g/L), the residual manga-
nese concentration in solution was below the detection limit; in
other words, 100% removal was achieved. Fig. 3 also shows the
effect of pH on the aqueous manganese concentration. After
100 min, residual metal concentration attained 6.5 mg/L when the
pH was maintained in 10 with NaOH. With sodium hydroxide,
manganese was removed as manganese hydroxide, which was
more soluble than the manganese carbonate (species expected in
the presence of high carbonate concentrations). From the data
presented in Figs. 3 and 4, it is clear that the presence of soluble
carbonate species was not the only factor accounting for metal
removal, but instead, the pH had a leading role on the removal
efficiency (Sthiannopkao and Sreesai, 2009). Even at higher
carbonate concentrations, lower removal efficiencies were
observed with sodium bicarbonate (final pH 8.0) as compared to
sodium carbonate (final pH 9.8) or even sodium hydroxide at pH
10.0. Fig. 1 explains this behavior as it shows lower metal
concentrations in equilibrium with manganese carbonate when
the pH increased in the presence of carbonate ions. Fig. 4 also
shows a fast reduction in the manganese concentration during the
first 5 min, followed by a slower decrease in metal concentration
with time and suggests that 90 min was sufficient for the manga-
nese concentration to be stabilized. In addition, manganese
removal from the mine water by sodium carbonateelimestone
mixtures was slower than that observed from the synthetic solu-
tion. The manganese concentration was reduced to 1 mg/L within
60 min in the experiments with the latter, while 90 min was
required for the metal concentration to reach 0.18 mg/L, at pH 8.6.

In addition to mine drainages, manganese can be also present in
effluents of hydrometallurgical and other industrial operations and
concentrations above 1 g/L may be found. The element can also be
present in leaching liquors, for instance, during sea nodules and
nickel laterite leaching (Zhang et al., 2010). In these studies,
manganese concentrations were high and the carbonate ions
selectively precipitated the manganese in the presence of calcium
and magnesium (Zhang and Cheng, 2007b). The carbonate effi-
ciency in increasing pH along with the manganese removal, was
assessed from synthetic solutions, in which the manganese
concentration varied from 300.0 mg/L to 2000.0 mg/L, prepared at
an initial pH value of 2.3. Fig. 5 shows that high-manganese
removal could be achieved provided sufficient carbonate was
added to the system. A residual manganese concentration below
1 mg/L, along with solution pH values above 8.8, was observed for
above mentioned tested manganese concentrations. These results
are consistent with the work of Jimenez et al. (2004) and Silva et al.
(2010).

3.2. Continuous manganese removal

Continuous experiments were carried out as the preliminary
step of a future pilot scale test. Such experiments were performed
with both the synthetic solution and the mine water. Manganese
removal was faster when synthetic solutions were studied, as the
metal concentration was reduced from 140 mg/L to 0.8 mg/L in the
presence of both limestone (12.5 g/L) and sodium carbonate
(0.67 g/L) (Fig. 6), while the pH decreased from 10.2 to 8.5 in the
first two resident times. After 8 resident times (480 min) and under
the same conditions, the manganese concentration reached
a concentration of 0.81 mg/L at pH 8.8. In the experiment carried
out only with sodium carbonate, the final concentration was similar
(0.81 mg/L); however, with a slower precipitation rate (likely due to
the absence of limestone in the reactor, which would have acted as
a surface for heterogeneous nucleation). This finding is supported
by Aziz et al. (2008), who stated that the presence of solid lime-
stone improves metal removal efficiencies. When the initial pH was
2.3, manganese removal was also high because a higher sodium
carbonate concentration was applied (0.83 g/L) that increased the
solution pH to the 7.1e9.2 range.

It was also noticed that sulfate removal (Table 1) did not impair
manganese precipitation. This phenomenon was observed in
a previous work when powdered limestone was applied for
manganese removal from a 16 mg/L Mn2þ and 2400 mg/L sulfate
mine water. Silva et al. (2010) observed a reduction of the manga-
nese removal from mine waters as compared to synthetic solutions
and this was ascribed to sulfate precipitation on the limestone
surface. As shown in Table 1, the sulfate concentration (determined
as total sulfur by ICP-OES) was reduced from 918 mg/L to 265 mg/L,
which is slightly above the 250 mg/L discharge limit set by many
countries worldwide. Other transition metal elements, although in

low concentrations, were also removed during treatment. These
metals were shown to precipitate as either carbonates (FeCO3 and
ZnCO3) or mixed hydroxide-carbonate compounds (Djedidi et al.,
2009), which seemed to be the case for copper and lead in the
present work. Nevertheless, sulfate may have affected manganese
removal kinetics, since its removal from mine water was slower
than from synthetic solutions and this was also observed in batch
experiments (Fig. 4). Notwithstanding, sulfate sorption by lime-
stone is currently being investigated.

3.3. Characterization

As high carbonate concentration and pH values were utilized in
the present work, manganese removal as carbonate was expected
as shown in Fig. 1a; thereby infrared spectroscopy was applied to
confirm manganese carbonate formation. This was achieved by
analyzing the solid material produced during manganese removal
by limestoneesodium carbonate blends. Fig. 7 shows the spectra of
limestone before and after contact with the manganeseeladen
solutions. The spectrum of a sample of pure manganese
carbonate is also presented for comparison. For pure calcite lime-
stone, a characteristic band assigned to the C]O shift was seen at
712 cm?1. This absorption band was also observed at 724 cm?1 for
pure manganese carbonate, as proposed by the Nassrallah-
Aboukais et al. (1998), who found this characteristic band at
726 cm?1 for rhodochrosite. Also, Makreski and Jovanovski (2003)
observed C]O shifts at 712 cm?1 and 722 cm?1, assigned to
CaCO3 and MnCO3 in kutnahorite (CaMnMg(CO3)2). Similarly, this
C]O band was observed at 728 cm?1 for manganese carbonate by
Santillán and Williams (2004). In addition to the C]O band at
712 cm?1 (limestone), Fig. 7 also shows a smaller IR shift at
724 cm?1 in the manganese-containing limestone produced in the
experiments with the mine water and those carried out with
synthetic solutions containing 300 mg/L (ppt. I) and 1500 mg/L(ppt.
II) manganese (Fig. 5). The formation of manganese carbonate was
confirmed by FTIR and the C]O band at 724 cm?1 was easily seen
when the mass of precipitated manganese carbonate was larger
(ppt. II). These results are supported by XPS studies on
manganeseecalcite interactions (Blanchard and Baer, 1992).
Bamforth et al. (2006) studied metal carbonate precipitation in
the presence of limestone aiming to treat a mine water containing
up to 5 mg/L manganese in the presence of calcium (w200 mg/L)
and magnesium (80e100 mg/L). Manganese carbonate was not
observed on the surface of limestone even though the mine water
presented 2 meq/L total alkalinity. Contrarily, magnesium calcite
was the only described precipitate on the surfaces of dolomite,
magnesite or limestone and it was suggested that the presence of
magnesium inhibited manganese carbonate formation. For the
mine water studied in the present work, Table 1 suggests that the
calcium removal was negligible, likely derived from limestone
dissolution during the experiments as previously discussed (Fig. 2).
Conversely, magnesium was also removed from the mine water, as
its concentration was reduced from 90.0 mg/L to 21.3 mg/L.
Nevertheless, MgCO3 which has the C]O characteristic band at
749 cm?1 (Grzechnik et al., 1999) could not be detected in Fig. 7,
possibly due to the low MgCO3 amount co-precipitated with
manganese. The findings of Bamforth et al. (2006) seem to be
related to the high Mg/Mn ratio (&gt;20) in the mine water studied,
which did not seem to be the case herein presented where the
initial Mg/Mn ratio was 0.64.

The precipitates were also analyzed by SEM-EDS. Fig. 8 depicts
limestone particles containing manganese produced under
different conditions. Fig. 8a and b shows both the images and the
EDS spectra of the solid material produced in the experiment with
the mine water, while Fig. 8c and d shows limestone particles
containing manganese precipitated in the experiments utilizing
300 mg/L and 2000 mg/L of Mn2þ, respectively. All the EDS spectra
showed calcium which was an indication that the larger particles
were limestone, whereas Fig. 8b and c depicts manganese mapping.
While the EDS spectra identified manganese on the surface of all
the analyzed limestone particles, Fig. 8b and 8c suggests that
manganese carbonate precipitated as very fine crystals, which was
further supported by (i) an increase in both surface and micropore
areas from 1.54 m2/g and 2.20 m2/g to 4.45 m2/g and 5.30 m2/g,
respectively; (ii) a reduction on d50 of the particle size distribution
from 5.6 mm to 3.6 mm, which suggested a higher proportion of fine
particles.

The produced manganese carbonate, although contaminated
with magnesium, can be blended with manganese carbonate and

smelted for the production of manganese ferroalloys. Magnesium
carbonate is always present in these ores and is applied in the slag
production step (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2004). It can also be applied
in the production of manganese dioxide, since manganese
carbonate is easily soluble in sulfuric acid solutions (Zhang and
Cheng, 2007a) without requiring any reducing agent. It is very
likely that mine waters or process effluents with high-manganese
concentrations would be generated in a manganese mine or



A.M. Silva et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 29-30 (2012) 11e1918
a manganese producing plant. Therefore, this blending could likely
be carried out in a cost-effective way.

Figs. 1e3 explain manganese removal efficiency with sodium
carbonate solutions. Besides the carbonate concentration, pH
control was also an important parameter for effective manganese
carbonate precipitation, as previously stated. Manganese carbonate
solubility increased quickly with acidity and even for high
carbonate/metal ratios, but at lower pH values, precipitation might
not be complete. Bamforth et al. (2006) observed low manganese
removal (30%) with a mine water containing an average of 3 mg/L
manganese, at pH 8.1, irrespective of the solid substrate utilized.
Conversely, Silva et al. (2010) observed complete manganese
removal from a 16.0 mg/L mine water at pH 8.8 with fine powdered
limestone. The reason for the low removal reported by the former
was likely the lower pH of the mine water, which could not support
extensive manganese carbonate formation. For mine waters con-
taining high-manganese and relatively low calcium and magne-
sium concentrations, manganese carbonate can be actually
observed on limestone surfaces, provided the mine water pH is
increased. When limestone is present, removal kinetics is improved
and a denser solid residue is produced, probably having better
settling features than the manganese carbonate alone. Future pilot
scale experiments will aim at determining process parameters and
the economics of an industrial scale process.

As discussed beforehand, water utilization in the mining
industry and the effects of mining activities on water bodies have
always been considered an important issue (Kemp et al., 2010). This
is due to potential conflicts with nearby communities or even the
country as a whole. Water has many uses in mining and therefore
water storage (either clean or polluted) in dams is required in most
mining operations worldwide. In wet climates, for instance tailing
dams are always a concern as the discharge of excess water during
wet seasons and spills (which are not uncommon) may have
important environmental consequences, such as the cyanide spill
observed in Guiana (Beebe, 2001) and in Romania (DeVries, 2001)
in late 20th and early 21st centuries, respectively. Another issue is
competition for access to water with other industries, agriculture
and human use as observed in water-scarce countries (Aitchison,
2008). In this particular context, a breakthrough solution was
adopted when a mining company started treating AMD and selling
drink water to the neighborhood community (Hutton et al., 2009).

To summarize, water can be an important source of contaminant
mobilization (Driussi and Jansz, 2006) and manganese, which has
a high solubility in water bodies is one of the most difficult toxic
metals to be removed. Although management measures are the
most important aspect of CP (Hilson, 2000), manganese removal
technologies are an important contribution for the full imple-
mentation of CP technologies in the mining industry.

4. Conclusions

Limestoneesodium carbonate blends were beneficial for
manganese removal from mine waters. Sodium carbonate provided
carbonate ions to precipitate high-manganese contents in mine
water and industrial effluents, whereas powdered limestone
induced the heterogeneous nucleation of manganese carbonate.
Manganese removal efficiency was defined by pH with values above
8.5 resulting in massive metal removal from the solution. Manga-
nese carbonate precipitation was confirmed by both infrared and
EDS spectroscopy. Powdered limestone enhanced manganese
precipitation kinetics and produced a denser solid residue with
potential advantages regarding settling properties. Future work will
focus on (i) the reduction of sodium carbonate consumption by
increasing the solution pH before Na2CO3 addition; (ii) the chemical
stability of the precipitated manganese carbonate and (iii)
manganese carbonate calcining. Research on manganese removal
should also address alternative solid substrates such as MnO2;
limestone sorption of other species present in the mine water, i.e.
sulfate, whereas field tests would determine any positive influence
of soluble carbonate additions to the mine water before their
passage in anoxic limestone drains, which is the main application of
limestone for the treatment of mine waters.
