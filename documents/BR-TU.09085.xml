Resumo: 

 

Para a modelização da distribuição espacial da carga interfoliar das 

esmectitas de Melo foram amostrados quatro perfis, sendo dois obtidos a partir de furos 

de sondagens e dois com amostras coletadas na frente da cava de exploração da 

ocorrência. Os perfis formam aproximadamente uma figura com a forma de um 

trapezoide isósceles possuindo uma mediana em torno de 100 m. Foi analisado um total 

de 21 amostras a partir dos perfis. A camada de bentonita na área estudada varia de 5 a 

6 metros de espessura e no perfil localiza-se entre a camada de solo do topo e uma 

camada sotoposta de arenito de granulação media a grossa. A composição mineralógica 

observada em rocha total ao XRD mostra um aumento do conteúdo de esmectita com a 

profundidade, estimando-se uma proporção de 30% a 50% na profundidade de 1,5m e 

de 90 a 96% na profundidade de 7 a 8,3 m, variando muito pouco de um perfil em 

relação a outro, porém, mantendo a tendência de aumento da esmectita em 

profundidade. Identifica-se montmorilonitas dioctaedricas magnesianas com predomínio 

de Ca na posição trocável, seguido de quartzo, feldspatos (albita e K-felçdspato) e 

raramente identifica-se traços de ilita e zeolitas (heulandita-clinoptilolita). A 

composição química por XRF também é coerente com a tendência observada na 

mineralogia, com uma diminuição em profundidade do teor de SiO2, K2O, Na2O 

indicativo de menos quartzo e feldspato e um aumento do MgO oriundo das 

substituições octaédricas da esmectita que também é responsável pela origem da carga 

interfoliar, Al2O3 da posição octaédrica das esmectitas, Fe2O3 supostamente octaédrico e 

CaO que entra no sistema para compensar o desequilíbrio elétrico das cargas.  

A carga interfoliar foi estimada na fração&amp;lt;1 ?m por dois métodos sendo 

que a distribuição espacial mostra uma tendência de aumentar na parte intermediária da 

camada com valores em torno de 0,56 e/huc, diminuindo em direção ao topo e em 

profundidade com valores variando entre 0,46 a 0,48 e/huc. Esta variação gradual é 

melhor observada nos difratogramas do que através do método de cálculo da carga 

interfoliar, que não possuem sensibilidade suficiente para identificar as pequenas 

variações. Entretanto, variações na posição e na forma do pico 001 da esmectita são 

evidencias significativas que permitem validar as conclusões. O cálculo da formula 

unitária da montmorilonita mostra uma carga interfoliar de origem octaédrica com uma 

distribuição heterogenia ao longo do perfil reforçada pela variação na sorção 

organofílica e no grau de expansão observado na montmorilonita.

A avaliação da capacidade de troca de cátions (CEC) utilizada no projeto 

foi validada com o método do acetado de amônio, sendo que os valores obtidos foram 

diretamente proporcionais a estimativa da carga interfoliar das amostras. Valores de 

CEC entre 110 moles/100gr de argila corresponde a uma carga interfoliar da ordem de 

0,55 e/huc e valores em torno de 90 moles/100gr de argila correspondem a cargas 

interfoliares em torno de 0,46 e/huc. A quantidade de cloreto de dodecylammonium 

(C12H28CIN) utilisado para organofilização foi proporcional a media do CEC. Em 

relação às propriedades físicas e organofilização, os padrões dos difratogramas das 

argilas organofilicas mostraram uma tendência de expansibilidade em função da carga 

interfoliar e a posição do pico 001 da montmorilonita-(C12H28CIN) que variou de 

17,05Å a 17,68Å. Pode-se considerar como um complexo bicamadas organo argilas, 

classicamente esperadas a 17,46Å considerando o tamanho da cadeia alkyl utilizada e a 

isoterma de sorção conhecida. As pequenas variações são indicativas da presença de 

camadas não intercaladas devido a heterogeneidade da carga. Embora as pequenas 

diferenças no espaçamento “d” entre as amostras, a relação da 001 argila organofilica do 

perfil em função da carga interfoliar, apresentou uma correlação perfeita. Comparando 

no perfil, o espaçamento 001 da argila orgânica tende a aumentar com a carga intefoliar. 

A posição do pico 001 varia entre 17,15Å e 17,5Å e a área do pico 001 após a 

organofilização variou entre 2620,6 (cps x deg) até 418,8 (cps x deg). 

A tendência observada para a distribuição espacial da carga interfoliar 

esta provavelmente relacionada com uma variação gradual da permeabilidade e da razão 

água/rocha durante a alteração. A zona media da camada que concentra os mais 

elevados valores de carga interfoliar mostrou frequentemente a presença de uma textura 

esferulítica. Também, traços de zeolitas no XRD foram encontrados somente em 

amostras da profundidade entre 4 e 6 metros, indicando que a razão água/rocha estava 

no limiar do campo de estabilidade onde as zeolitas são favorecidas em detrimento das 

esmectitas no processo alteração do vidro vulcânico. 

Palavras-chave: Bentonita, montmorilonita, carga interfoliar, organofilização.

Abstract: 

 

To model the spatial distribution of key smectite properties, four profiles 

were sampled, two coming from boreholes and 2 from fresh cut samples over the 

mining front, Forming roughly an Isosceles Trapezoid with a median of approximately 

100 m; 21 samples were analyzed over the four profiles. Bentonite bed ranges in the 

studied area from 5 to 6 m thick underlying top soil layer and overlaying a gross grain 

sandstone layer. Mineralogical composition observed on whole rock XRD traces 

showed an increasing content of the smectitic phase as a function of depth, going from 

30% to 50% at around 1,5 m depth to 90 to 96 % at  a depth ranging 7 to 8,3 m depth, 

varying very slightly from one profile to another but keeping the trend. Mayor mineral 

phases identified were Mg rich dioctahedral montmorillonite with mainly Ca in 

exchangeable position, Quartz,   feldspar (Albite and K-feldspar) and only occasionally 

as trace phases we observed Illite and Zeolites (heulandite-clinoptilolite). XRF chemical 

analysis results are also coherent with this vertical tendencies, expressed in a notable 

decrease of a  SiO2, K2O, Na2O indicating less quartz and feldspar species; and with 

increasing of MgO as octahedral substitution representing the main source of layer 

charge, Al2O3 most octahedral but also in a rather small amount as tetrahedral 

substitutions, Fe2O3   presumably octahedral and CaO compensating electrical charge 

desequilibrium. 

Layer charge was estimated on the&amp;lt;1 ?m size fraction by two methods 

and spatial distribution shows a clear trend to increase at the middle of the bed up to 

values around 0,56 e/huc and decrease towards top and bottom over values ranging 

from 0.46 to 0,48 e/huc. This gradual variations can be better observed on the XRD 

patters than by actual layer charge calculation methods results, given the fact that for 

this slight variances, commonly used methods are not sensible enough, Nevertheless the 

001 peak position and shape of the smectite phase represents sufficient  evidence for 

conclusions. Layer charge distribution is mainly Octahedral derived from unit formula 

calculations and Layer charge is clearly heterogeneous due to Organophilic sorption and 

swelling behavior observed.

Cation exchange capacity was calculated by ammonium acetate method, 

values obtained are directly proportional to layer charge estimations over those samples.  

CEC values around 110 moles/100gr of clay correspond to Layer charge on the order of  

0,55 e/huc and  values around 90 moles/100gr of clay  to layer charges around 0,46 

e/huc. The amount of dodecylammonium Chloride (C12H28CIN) used for 

organophilization was established proportional to the CEC average. Regarding the 

implications on physical properties and organophilization, XRD patterns of 

Organophilic clays showed a tendency on expandability as a function of layer charge in 

terms of their 001 (C12H28CIN)-Montmorillonite peak position, ranging from 17,05 Å 

To 17,68 Å. They could all be considered as bilayer intercalated Organoclay complexes, 

classically expected at 17,46 Å according size of the alkyl chain used, and the known 

sorption isotherm. The slight variances are indicating the presence of non-intercalated 

sheets due to charge heterogeneity. Despite the slight d-spacing differences among 

samples, the relationship 001 Organophilic C profile as a function of layer charge has a  

perfect correlation. Comparing a single profile,  001 d-spacing of organoclays tends to 

increase with increasing layer charge. The position of the 001 peak ranges between 

17.15 Å and 17.5 Å and the raw 001 peak area after organophilization can vary from 

2620.6(cps x deg)  to  418.8 (cps x deg).  

The tendencies observed for layer charge spatial distribution are probably 

related to gradual variations of permeability and water/rock ratio during alteration,  the 

middle zone of the bed that concentrates higher values of layer charge also has showed 

very frequent  presence of spherulitic textures that may belonged originally of opal-CT 

but replaced by recrystallized quartz unlike top and bottom of the bed, also  Zeolites 

XRD traces were only found in samples located from 4 to 6 m depth,  indicating that 

water rock ratio close to the threshold where Zeolites are favored with respect to 

smectites as a product of alteration.

1 - Introdução 

 

Bentonita talvez seja a argila industrial mais utilizada devido as suas 

excepcionais propriedades. Por centenas de anos e ainda hoje a tecnologia tenta 

controlar os parâmetros chaves que determinam o comportamento das fases esmectitas 

que formam a bentonita, especialmente quando esta interage com outros tipos de 

compostos. Em especial quando a interação esta relacionada com a troca dos cátions 

intercamadas das esmectitas naturais, sendo este o caso em várias aplicações industriais, 

medicas e ambientais. 

Interessante o fato que mesmo sendo a carga interfoliar reconhecida 

como uma, se não a mais importante propriedade da família das esmectitas e 

fundamental para a compreensão da capacidade de interação destes minerais, ainda 

existe uma lacuna no conhecimento da sua distribuição nas ocorrências de bentonita, da 

influencia dos processos diagenéticos e sobre os métodos apropriados para sua 

estimativa. 

O depósito de bentonta de Melo, norte do Uruguai, tem sido descrito 

como praticamente uma argila monomineralica formada por esmectita cálcica 

dioctaedrica originária da alteração de cinza vulcânica riolítica, depositada em ambiente 

transicional lagunar durante o Permiano Superior. O contexto geológico dos estratos 

que contem a bentonita, associado a bacia sedimentar intracratônica do Paraná 

permitiram preservar a esmectita, que não apresenta sinais de ilitização apesar da idade.. 

Por outro lado a preservação da esmectita no tempo geológico transforma esta bentonita 

numa importante fonte para pesquisas no campo dos processos diagenéticos e também 

sobre a distribuição espacial das propriedades químicas e físicas. 

As implicações industriais do conhecimento das variações da carga 

interfoliar é explorado neste projeto visando a organofilização de um conjunto de 

amostras selecionadas pelo critério da variação da carga interfoliar. Os resultados 

produziram informações sobre as relações entre a variação espacial da carga interfoliar e 

as propriedades de sorção das montmorilonitas. 

O projeto atual foi desenvolvido como uma pesquisa em conjunto entre a 

Universidade Técnica de Creta e a Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, sob a

supervisão de George Christidis (TUC) e Prof. Norberto Dani (UFRGS). O resultado da 

pesquisa tem como objetivo elaborar um documento para ser apresentado como 

requisito parcial para a obtenção do Título de Mestre em Geociências da UFRGS e no 

Programa “Erasmus Mundus” intitulado “International Master in Advanced Clay 

Science” com o suporte financeiro da Clay Mineral Society (CMS).  

2 – Generalidades 

2.1 - Localização 

As ocorrências de bentonita de Bañado de Medina, objeto deste estudo, 

estão localizadas a 20 Km na direção SW d cidade de Melo, na rodovia para Fraile 

Muerto, norte do Uruguai, como é mostrado na imagem de satélite (Figura 01). 

 

Figura 1 – Localização geográfica das ocorrências de bentonita do Bañado de Medina. 

 

A região onde se encontram as ocorrências de bentonita são utilizadas 

como fazendas para criação de gado possuindo uma fisiografia plana dentro do bioma 

denominado de “Pampa”, muito característico do local. A área alvo para exploração da 

ocorrência tem alguns hectares e apenas uma pequena parte esta sendo utilizada como 

pode ser visualizado no mapa georreferenciado da figura 02.

2.2- Como acessar a ocorrência 

A partir de Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, utiliza-se a BR290 por uma 

distância de 250 Km na direção oeste. Após acessa-se a BR473 até a cidade de Bagé na 

direção SW. Pela mesma rodovia chega-se a cidade de Aceguá, fronteiriça entre o Brasil 

e Uruguai. Continua-se par o sul pela Rodovia Nacional 8 por mais 60 Km até a cidade 

de Melo. Finalmente, para chegar a ocorrência de Bañado de Medina utiliza-se a 

Rodovia Nacional 7 na direção sudoeste por uma distância de 17 Km, quando então 

toma-se a Rodovia 26 que dará acesso a ocorrência a uma distância aproximada de 2 

Km a esquerda da rodovia.

realizado com estação total. 

 

2.3 – Contexto Geológico 

A ocorrência de bontonita de Bañado de Medina localizada a 18 Km 

sudoeste da cidade Melo, norte do Uruguai, tem sido caracterizada e geologicamente 

descrita como uma argila essencialmente monominerálica constituída de esmectita 

dioctaedrica com Ca como o principal cátion trocável na posição intercamada (Calarge 

et al. 2001). Desenvolveu-se a partir da alteração de cinzas vulcânicas depositadas num 

ambiente transicional lagunar. Pertence estratigraficamente a Formação Rio do Rastro 

no Permiano Superior (equivalente a Formação Yaguari no Uruguai, Andreis et al. 

1996, Rocha-Campos et al. 2010). Embora sendo uma ocorrência do Permiano, 

manteve-se preservada devido ao contexto geológico especial ligado a Bacia 

Intracratônica do Paraná e localmente devido a um grupo de falhas que protegeram 

camadas relativamente pouco espessas de bentonita da erosão. Representam uma 

importante fonte de informação para estudos envolvendo processo diageneticos e no 

estudo da variação de propriedades físicas e químicas em função da sua distribuição 

espacial.  

A camada de bentonita de Bañado de Medina tem sido correlacionada 

com área fonte vulcânica de composição riolítica (Coutinho et al. 1981. 1991). A 

possível fonte vulcânica estaria localizada no sudoeste da Argentina. Formoso et al 

(1998)  datou as camadas como Permiano Inferior a Médio. Caralge et al (2001) e 

Meunier et al (2005) correlacionam Bañado de Medina com as ocorrências de bontonita 

em Aceguá, sul do Brasil, baseado em similaridades mineralógicas e na assinatura 

química de minerais pesados e elementos terras raras (REE). Sugerem que a variação 

dos elementos maiores, RRE e abundancia dos elementos menores na camada de argila 

indicam dois eventos sucessivos de queda de cinzas vulcânicas. O teor dos elementos 

traços indicam um vidro vulcânico fracionado derivado de magmas riolíticos 

produzidos numa contexto geológico de subducção/colisão. 

Com relação à fonte vulcânica, Rocha-Campos et al (2009) consideram 

que a província ígnea de Choiyoi do bloco São Rafael, localizado no oeste da Argentina 

(Patagônia) poderia ser considerada como a área fonte do vulcanismo durante o 



5 
 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

  

Permiano. A figura 03 mostra a influencia geográfica deste vulcanismo. Embora Melo 

possui uma idade permiana, a atividade vulcânica do norte da Patagônia atingiu seu pico 

no Triássico e no Jurássico Inferior (Andreis et al, 1996), sendo eventos mais explosivos 

devido a natureza felsica dos magmas (Axelrod, 1985).

industrialização da bentonita. Entretanto outros aspectos da investigação devem ser 

mencionados: 

1. Atualmente a pequena ocorrencia de Bañado de Medina esta explorado com metodos de 
escavação a céu aberto sem critérios de mistura ou de homogeneização das diferentes 
frentes. Cerca de 30% a 35% dos 9 m ou 7 m de um perfil tipico é descartado. Somente as 
seções com elevada proporção de esmectita são exploradas. A XRD mostra que em 
profundidades de 1,5 m – 2,2 m a partir da cobertura de solotem um conteudo 
siginificativo de montmorilonita dioctaedrica em proporções que podem variar entre 
25% a 60%. Isto fica exemplificado nos perfis F1, C e F2. De acordo com o uso final a 
mistura de materiais com diferentes proporções de montmorilonita pode ser 
conveniente no sentido de extender as reservas e a vida util da ocorrência. 

2. Os resultados da pesquisa podem servir como criterios de prospecção, considerando que 
a fonte vulcanica da bentonta esta localizada na Patagonia e foi ativa até o Jurásico 
Superior. A distância a partir da área fonte permite pensar na possibilidade de se 
encontrar ocorrencias similares com interesse economico numa ampla área. Camadas 
similares, embora com espessuras pequenas foram encontradas no sul do Brasil. O 
entendimento das condições diageneticas da ocorrência e as variáveis de preservação 
pode estabelecer parametros para prever outras ocurrencias. O entendimento de como a 
carga interfoliar do depósito vvaria e como afeta as propriedades física, será possivel 
predizer a qualidade outras ocorrências em relação ao processo diagenetico identificado. 

3. A estimativa da carga interfoliar será feita por dois metodos diferentes (Christidis E. G. et 
al,. 2003), será possivel comparar os resultados em amostras com diferentes cargas 
intefoliares e proximo a margem de erro dos metodos. 

3 – Resultados e conclusões 

A carga interfoliar da esmectita na ocorrencia de Bañado de Medina 

tende a ser maior nas porçoes centrais da camada de bentonita. Para a utilização 

industrial da bentonita é importante o entendimento das substituiçoes octaédricas e 

tetraédricas na estrutura das escmectitas que irão se refletir nas propriedades no 

contexto das aplicações.  

Observou-se uma correlação entre o padrão dos difratogramas das 

organoargilas (C12H28CIN)-montmorilonita com os valores da carga interfoliar. O 

espaçamento do pico 001 organoargila tende a aumentar com o aumento da carga 

interfoliar. O complexo argila com a amina tende a ser do tipo bicamada.  

Os resultados também podem ser aplicados para estimar a quantidade de 

reagentes que deverão ser empregados para estimular a troca catiônica da esmectita. 

Aplicando-se o conhecimento da distribuição da carga interfoliar otimizaria o 

tratamento da esmectita e a metodologia de mistura de diferentes esmectitas encontradas 

ao longo do perfil.

CHAPTER I 
1.1 - Introduction 

 
Bentonite have been perhaps one of the most widely use industrial clays due to their 
amazing physical properties, It has been the case for hundreds of years and yet we are 
still mastering the art of controlling key parameters that determine the behaviour of 
smectite phases within bentonites, when interacting to any other kind of compounds. 
Particularly when this interaction is related to the exchangeability of interlayer cations on 
natural smectite, and it is broadly the case in Industrial, medical, environmental and other 
applications. 

 

 It is indeed remarkable the fact that even though layer charge is recognized as one, if 
not the most determinative property of the smectitic family to comprehend its general 
interaction behaviour, there is a lot to be studied about its distribution in any bentonite 
occurrence, the influence of digenetic processes and alteration on this distribution and 
about proper methods for estimation.  

 

On the other hand, the bentonite deposit in Melo, North Uruguay, has been described as 
a almost monomineralic clay consisting of dioctahedral Ca smectite formed from 
alteration of rhyolitic volcanic ashes, which were deposited in lagoonal to transitional 
environment belonging stratigraphycally to Late Permian. This implies that it may 
constitute one of the oldest exploited bentonite deposit known and yet it’s been kept 
under remarkably well preserved conditions without any signs of illitization. This rare 
characteristic is perhaps specially related to the geological context linked to an 
intracratonic basin (Paraná Basin). Therefore it represents an outstanding source for 
academic research to gain additional knowledge about the digenetic process itself and 
also the way physical and chemical properties can be spatially distributed. 

 

To achieve a complete perspective of the implications that a rational layer charge 
variation could have upon industrial uses of bentonites, the present research project also 
evaluates organophilization over a set of samples selected by layer charge variance 
criteria. These results will provide enough information about the actual layer charge 
spatial variations on the sorption properties of montmorillonite.  

 

The present project has been developed as a Joint research between the Technical 
University of Crete and Universidade Federal de Rio Grade do Sul, under the supervision 
of George Christidis (TUC) and Prof Norberto Dani (UFRGS), As a master thesis to for 
the Erasmus Mundus Program “International Master in Advanced Clay Science” and with 
the financial support of the Clay Mineral Society (CMS)

1.2 - Abstract 
 

The Choiyoi igneous province from San Rafael block located in central Western 
Argentina (Patagonia) should be considered as source for rhyolitic ash fall deposits 
during the earlier to mid Permian at the south section of the Parana Basin, in this context, 
the bentonite bed at Bañado de Medina, located 20 Km from Melo, Northern Uruguay is 
an outstandingly well preserved stratiform bed considering the age of deposition. It may 
constitute one of the oldest known bentonite deposit without signs of illitization and 
having economic potential. It derived from an early alteration in a lagoon to transitional 
environment, and it was protected from diagenesis due to the special geological situation 
linked to a intracratonic basin, presenting evidence of burial with a compact appearance 
but low diagenetic conditions, more locally it was probably conserved from erosion due to 
a series of faults also evident in field. 
To model the spatial distribution of key smectite properties, four profiles were sampled, 
two coming from boreholes and 2 from fresh cut samples over the mining front, Forming 
roughly an Isosceles Trapezoid with a median of approximately 100 m; 21 samples were 
analyzed over the four profiles. Bentonite bed ranges in the studied area from 5 to 6 m 
thick underlying top soil layer and overlaying a gross grain sandstone layer. Mineralogical 
composition observed on whole rock XRD traces showed an increasing content of the 
smectitic phase as a function of depth, going from 30% to 50% at around 1,5 m depth to 
90 to 96 % at  a depth ranging 7 to 8,3 m depth, varying very slightly from one profile to 
another but keeping the trend. Mayor mineral phases identified were Mg rich dioctahedral 
montmorillonite with mainly Ca in exchangeable position, Quartz,   feldspar (Albite and K-
feldspar) and only occasionally as trace phases we observed Illite and Zeolites 
(heulandite-clinoptilolite). XRF chemical analysis results are also coherent with this 
vertical tendencies, expressed in a notable decrease of a  SiO2, K2O, Na2O indicating 
less quartz and feldspar species; and with increasing of MgO as octahedral substitution 
representing the main source of layer charge, Al2O3 most octahedral but also in a rather 
small amount as tetrahedral substitutions, Fe2O3   presumably octahedral and CaO 
compensating electrical charge desequilibrium. 
Layer charge was estimated on the&amp;lt;1 ?m size fraction by two methods and spatial 
distribution shows a clear trend to increase at the middle of the bed up to values around 
0,56 e/huc and decrease towards top and bottom over values ranging from 0.46 to 0,48 
e/huc. This gradual variations can be better observed on the XRD patters than by actual 
layer charge calculation methods results, given the fact that for this slight variances, 
commonly used methods are not sensible enough, Nevertheless the 001 peak position 
and shape of the smectite phase represents sufficient  evidence for conclusions. Layer 
charge distribution is mainly Octahedral derived from unit formula calculations and Layer 
charge is clearly heterogeneous due to Organophilic sorption and swelling behavior 
observed.  
Cation exchange capacity was calculated by ammonium acetate method, values 
obtained are directly proportional to layer charge estimations over those samples.  CEC 
values around 110 moles/100gr of clay correspond to Layer charge on the order of  0,55 
e/huc and  values around 90 moles/100gr of clay  to layer charges around 0,46 e/huc. 
The amount of dodecylammonium Chloride (C12H28ClN) used for organophilization was 
established proportional to the CEC average. Regarding the implications on physical 
properties and organophilization, XRD patterns of Organophilic clays showed a tendency 
on expandability as a function of layer charge in terms of their 001 (C12H28ClN)-

Montmorillonite peak position, ranging from 17,05 Å To 17,68 Å. They could all be 
considered as bilayer intercalated Organoclay complexes, classically expected at 17,46 
Å according size of the alkyl chain used, and the known sorption isotherm. The slight 
variances are indicating the presence of non-intercalated sheets due to charge 
heterogeneity. Despite the slight d-spacing differences among samples, the relationship 
001 Organophilic C profile as a function of layer charge has a  perfect correlation. 
Comparing a single profile,  001 d-spacing of organoclays tends to increase with 
increasing layer charge. The position of the 001 peak ranges between 17.15 Å and 17.5 
Å and the raw 001 peak area after organophilization can vary from 2620.6(cps x deg)  to  
418.8 (cps x deg).  
The tendencies observed for layer charge spatial distribution are probably related to 
gradual variations of permeability and water/rock ratio during alteration,  the middle zone 
of the bed that concentrates higher values of layer charge also has showed very frequent  
presence of spherulitic textures that may belonged originally of opal-CT but replaced by 
recrystallized quartz unlike top and bottom of the bed, also  Zeolites XRD traces were 
only found in samples located from 4 to 6 m depth,  indicating that water rock ratio close 
to the threshold where Zeolites are favored with respect to smectites as a product of 
alteration.

CHAPTER II 
Generalities 

2.1 – Location 
 
The bentonite deposit at Bañado de Medina, object of this study is located about 20 Km 
South West of the small city named Melo, on the road to Fraile Muerto, Northern 
Uruguay, as shown in the satellite image (Figure 1) 
 

 
Figure 1- Geographical location of the Bentonite deposit at Bañado de Medina 

There are two overlapping properties in the deposit 84 and 162 Hectares respectively, 
basically Cattle farms constituted by flatlands “Pampas” that are very characteristic of the 
region. The area exposed for mineral exploitation is just few hectares from which only a 
small portion has been used so far as exposed in the georeferenced map below (Fig. 2).  

 

2.2 -How to get there 
 

Perhaps from Porto Alegre, Capital of Rio Grande do Sul- Brazil, the best way to get 
there is by following the coastline road heading south, nevertheless and for logistical 
reasons we first stop in  Caçapava do Sul, approximately 250 Km SW of Poa by the BR 
290. Then we took the RS 357 road direction SW followed by BR 473 Until we reached 
Bage. And then on the same road we crossed the borderline Uruguay-Brazil thought 
Acegua  to continue South on National route 8 for some 60 km towards Melo. Finally To 
find the Bentonite deposit at Bañado de medina one has take national route 7 on 
direction SW for 17 Km, turn left at the crossroad with route 26 and the main gate of the 
quarry will be just 2 km ahead on your left.

The Bentonite deposit named as Bañado de Medina located 18 Km southwest from Melo, 
Northern Uruguay, has been characterized and geologically described as an essentially 
monomineralic clay containing dioctahedral smectite mainly with Ca exchangeable 
cations in the interlayer position (Calarge et al., 2001).  It evolved from the alteration of 
volcanic ashes deposited in a lagoonal to transitional environment that belongs 
stratigraphycally to Late Permian Rio do Rastro Formation (equivalent to Yaguari 
Formation in Uruguay, Andreis et al., 1996, Rocha-Campos et al., 2010). This implies  
that it may constitute one of the oldest bentonite deposits known and yet it’s been kept 
under remarkably well preserved, due to the special geological context linked to a 
intracratonic basin (Paraná Basin) and more locally due to a series of faults that 
protected the rather thin bed from erosion. Therefore it represents an outstanding source 
for academic research to achieve more knowledge about the digenetic process itself and 
also the way physical and chemical properties can vary as a function of their spatial 
distribution. 

The bentonite bed at Bañado de Medina has been correlated to a regional scale of 
rhyolitic volcanic source occurrences, (Coutinho et al. 1981, 1991), where the volcanic 
source was probably located in southwestern Argentina and Chile. Formoso et al (1998) 
dated the bed as Earlier to Mid Permian. Calarge et al (2001) and Meunier et al (2005) 
correlated Bañado de medina to the bentonite occurrences at Acegua, Southern Brazil, 
based upon mineralogical similarities and chemical signature of heavy minerals and rare 
earth elements (REE). They suggested that variations in major element, RRE and minor 
element abundances throughout the massive clay deposit indicate two successive ash 
falls. Moreover, the abundance of trace elements indicates a fractionated volcanic glass 
derived from rhyolitic magmas produced in a subduction/collision geological context. 

About the volcanic source and in a more regional scale, a precise work was presented by 
Rocha-Campos et al (2009). These researchers stated that the Choiyoi igneous province 
from San Rafael block located in central Western Argentina (Patagonia) should be 
considered as source for the ash fall deposits during the Permian section of the Parana 
Basin, along the Pacific margin of Southwest Gondwana and the geological evolution of 
neighboring Paleozoic Foreland basins in South America and Africa.  Figure 3 shows a 
geographical influential spectrum of the volcanic ash source. Although Melo has been 
dated as Permian, it is also accepted that volcanic activity in Northern Patagonia reached 
an activity peak in the Triassic and early Jurassic (Andreis et al, . 1996) and these events 
have been described as more highly explosive due to the felsic nature of the magmas 
(Axelrod, 1985).

2.4 - Background 
2.4.1 - Justification for this research 
 
The project has been justified in the introduction regarding the importance of layer charge 
spatial distribution and possible implications on industrial applications of bentonites, 
nevertheless there are other aspect of this investigation that are worthy to be mentioned: 

 
1. At the moment the small quarry in Bañado de Medina is being mined with 

opencast methods without mixing criteria or homogenizing throughout the different 
fronts.  About 25% to 35 % of the 9 m to 7 m typical profile is discarded; only the 
very high smectitic section of the bed is currently exploited. XRD traces in the 
current research show how at depths 1.5 m - 2,2 m from the top soil have a 
significant dioctahedral montmorillonite content that can vary from 60% to 25%. 
Such is the case of profiles F1, C and F2 (Fig 3 - F1 profile whole rock XRD as a 



13 
 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

  

function of depth), According to the end uses mixing of materials with different 
montmorillonite contents could be convenient in order to extend reserves and 
service life for this deposit. 

 
2. At a regional scale, the implications of the results derived from this research could 

provide valuable prospection criteria, considering that the volcanic source for this 
bentonite deposit was located in the Argentinean Northern Patagonia and was 
active until the Late Jurassic. The distance from the source to the deposit 
constitutes sufficient reason to believe that is very possible to find similar deposits 
of economical interest in the broader area. Similar beds, though with insignificant 
thickness, have been found in South Brazil. By understanding the diagenetic 
conditions of this deposit and all preserving variables one could establish 
parameters to predict other possible occurrences. At a more global scale, this 
deposit represents a unique opportunity to study a bentonite deposit with the 
characteristics mentioned before, and this is perhaps the first attempt to do so 
under this perspective.  In addition, by going deeper into how the layer charge of 
this deposit varies and how it affects all physical properties, we could draw 
conclusions that will enable to predict qualities of other deposits as a consequence 
of their own diagenetic process. 

 
3. The fact that estimation of layer charge will be performed by two different 

methods2, will provide a good comparison over a set of samples with different 
layer charge values and just above the error margin of the methods. 

 
 
 
2.4.2 Related studies about Melo. 
 
 
The bentonite occurrence has been first reported by Goñi (1952) an then by Bossi 
(1966). In the section “Geological context” (page 6) there is a complete description of the 
whole evolution regarding the geological origin of Melo Bentonite deposit and a 
chronology of related research. However, there are other investigations that were 
consulted along the progress of this work that they also provided valuable information. 
 
The research performed by Calarge et al (2003) proposes the idea of layer charge 
heterogeneity for this deposit as a function of swelling capability. Although these authors 
describe the stratiform bentonite as a 1,5 m thick smectite rich bed, which contains less 
than 5% non clay minerals. In contrast the current research showed that the highly pure 
bentonite bed can be up to 5 m thick and its mineralogical  composition vary widely

particularly at the top. On behalf that publication one can say that the exposure of a 
whole perspective at the quarry is a rather recent event. Calarge et al.(2003) proposed a 
layer charge of -0,45 per half unit cell3, and the presence of smectites randomly 
interstratified in terms of layer charge magnitudes, to explain layer charge 
heterogeneities and the observed presence of non-expandable layers. This idea seems 
to be in agreement with what was observed in this work in the spatial distribution of layer 
charge and we will comment further on this later on at results. 

 
Several works developed at UFRGS about Bañado de Medina where also consulted. 
Published work on the geology, mineralogy and technological applicaitons of Melo 
bentonite by Delfino et al. (2009) Under the name of “Jazida de Bentonita de Banado de 
Medina,Melo,Uruguai. Geologia, Mineralogia e utilizacao tecnologica”. presents a very 
detailed geo-structural model derived from a series of 31 Boreholes. This campaign 
provided samples of profiles B and C used in the present investigation. The CEC of the 
bentonite varied between Between 101 and 116 meq/100g and the bentonite reserves 
were estimated to be 580.000 metric tones. 
   
 
2.4.2 Related studies on Layer charge  
 
The Clay Mineral Society (CMS) published on 1994 the workshop lecture, Volume 6 

named Layer charge characteristics of 2:1 silicate clay minerals. It is a key document 

used as a ground base to interpret interactions between montmorillonite and amines as a 

function of layer charge (Lagaly, 1994, Laird, 1994). Particularly the chapters developed 

by G. Lagaly, “layer charge determination by alkylammonium Ions”, the one by D.A. Laird 

“Evaluation of structural formula and Alkilammonium methods of determining layer 

charge”. And Specially the one offered by S.A. Boyd and W.F. Jaynes.  This work was 

also used as a reference of related studies about organophilization. 

  
Christidis &amp;amp; Eberl (2003) proposed one of the methods used in this research to estimate 

layer charge and charge heterogeneity. The mentioned publication explains how from 29 

well characterized samples loaded on a data base, is possible to compare  XRD patterns 

after potassium saturation and ethylene glycol solvation to obtain layer charge magnitude 

and heterogeneity from profile fitting or by peak position criteria. The layer charge 

program that resulted from this work was written on Visual Basic and the code employed 

                                                 
3 This value is among the range of layer charge magnitudes obtained in this study, tending towards the lower limit. 
(from -0,44 to -0,56 per half unit cell)

by macro function of Microsoft Excel.  This software was provided by George Christidis, 

co-supervisor of the present research to the author.  

The journal “Elements”, Vol 5, April 2009, published an issue devoted on bentonites. 

Christidis &amp;amp; Huff addressed the topic of layer charge and provided a broad overview 

about the variables which control bentonite formation and alteration. This publication 

showed evidence for cryptic variations in bentonite deposits, as was reported by 

Christidis and Makri (2007) in a bentonite deposit located in Milos-Greece and in a 1 m 

thick bed in Charentes, France by Alain Meunier et al (2004).

from a Bentonite deposit located in Charentes, France. Data from Meunier et al (2004) 

(after Christidis &amp;amp; Huff, 2009) 

2.4.3 - Related studies on Organophilization 
 
It is widely accepted that layer charge is the most important parameter of smectites when 
organophilization is intended (A.R. Murray, 1994). Nevertheless, It is classically C.E.C 
the parameter used to estimate the amount of amines that will be added in the process. 
Although C.E.C and layer charge usually should be directly related, there are other 
parameters that may affect this relationship, such as crystal size, stacking sequence and 
arrangement, charge density, etc. Nevertheless this topic is not a matter of this research.

On the other hand, industrially it is perhaps the proportion of the smectite present in a 
given bentonite the main factor to take into account, not only for organoclays but also in 
any kind of activation and many other processes. 
Therefore, is important to outline that organophilicity itself if is not the purpose of this 
research but a mean to evaluate a tangible influence of layer charge spatial variations on 
the efficiency of the amine-clay intercalation. 
Basic evaluation parameters and principles  where extracted from  The Clay Mineral 
Society 1994 workshop lecture, Volume 6, chapter by S.A. Boyd and W.F. Jaynes  “Role 
of Layer charge in organic contaminants sorption”.

CHAPTER III 
Methods and material 

 
3.1 - XRD 

 
All 21 samples were analyzed on XRD as non oriented powder and less that 1 micron 
size fraction to acquire almost monophase diffraction pattern. Whole rock analysis will 
establish mayor mineral phases present; homogeneity of trioctaheral nature for 
Montmorillonite and together with SRF chemical analyses through molar estimations is 
also possible to establish a semi-quantitave comparison of mineral phase’s proportions, 
present in each pattern, and how it fluctuates as function of depth. As for the clay fraction 
size, Air dried samples vs. ethylene glycol solvated will determine swelling behaviour. 
Also Sodium saturation4, Potassium saturation and Organo-clays where analyzed, Finally 
XRD patterns from a potassium saturated and ethylene glycol solvated will be compared 
to a XRD simulated traces calculated from three component interlayering as established 
in the Christidis Eberl method (Christidis E. G. et al,. 2003) for layer charge estimations.  
All specific preparation procedure is explained later on in this text. Parameters and

after amine intercalation to distinguish better the efficiency of amine absorbed onto the interlayer space. It will be

Whole samples where gently ground with pestle and mortar. Ten representative samples 
were selected with spatial position criteria; subsequently they were wet sieved to obtain 
&gt;53  ?m fraction for observation of heavy minerals. Afterwards the &gt; 1 ?m size fraction 
was obtained by sedimentation according to Stokes law using deionised water.  Ethylene 
Glycol treatment was done in rounds of no more than 5 samples at a time to avoid 
evaporation of ethylene glycol; samples were put in a glass desiccator at 60°C for a 
period ranging 16 hrs to 24 hrs. 
Na and K saturation was performed on the&amp;lt;1 ?m fractions using 1M NaCl and KCl 
solutions respectively. The samples were saturated for at least 4 times, the last one 
overnight under mechanical agitation. Each time the solution was changed. After 
saturation the samples were rinsed shortly by dispersing the clay fractions with an  
ultrasound device and finally washed four times with ethyl alcohol.  
  
 
3.2 SEM 

 
Scanning electron microscopy was performed in a JEOL 6060 SEM. The samples were 
mounted on metallic stubs using a double stick electrically-conductive carbon tape,and 
coated with gold and carbon as is usually done in UFRGS geosciences department for 
better imaging. Only morphology was observed because there was no EDX analysis 
available. 
  
3.3 Optical Microscopy. 

 
The optical microscopy was performed with a Leika DMLP optical microscope. Freshly 
cut bentonite samples were mounted on petrographic slides with a special glue to avoid 
fracture when swelling. Then they were dry polished to ~ 100 ?m thickness.  

 
3.4 TG analysis 
 
A set of 20 samples were analyzed on a PerkinElmer thermo-gravimetric analyzer TGA 
6. The thermal analysis was run up to 920° C on a heating ramp of 20 C° per minute. 
Samples where finely ground and the initial mass used varied from 15 mg to 30 mg. 
 
 
3.5 XRF analysis 
Chemical analysis of whole rock and&amp;lt;1?m size fraction was determined using the X-Ray 
fluorescence (XRF) technique, using an S 2 Ranger EDX spectrometer by Bruker. A total 
of 42 samples5 and ten random control duplicates were used to prepare fusion beads. 
Loss on Ignition (LOI) was determined before melting following the procedure explained

in next paragraph. Fired powders after determination of  LOI were mixed with Lithium 
tetraborate (B4Li2O7) flux under the following conditions: 

1. Mixing proportion whole rock:flux was 5:16. 

2. Mixing proportions for most&amp;lt;1 ?m fractions was 8:17. Although some 
samples had a different proportion this ratio was kept and used in the 
instrument software settings to calibrate concentrations. 

3. Samples were gently ground, and weighed, then B4Li2O7 was added 
progressively to obtain a homogenous powder, subsequently the mixtures 
were placed in platinum crucibles and finally three drops of lithium bromide 
(BrLi) were added and the samples were melted in a Claisse M4 gas Fluxer 
to obtain the fusion beads.  

 

3.6 Loss on Ignition (L.O.I.) 
 

L.O.I was estimated for all 42 samples and 10 aleatory selected duplicates by following 
this steps: 

1. Porcelain crucibles were weighed after drying in an oven at 110ºC. 
2. Each crucible was labeled and filled with a powder either of whole rock or 

&lt;1?m particle size, dried for at least 3 hrs at 105ºC and weighed. Then the 
dry weight of the samples was recorded.  

3. Subsequently the powders were fired for 2 hrs at 1000ºC. Finally from the 
difference of the weight after drying and and after firing, the LOI was 
estimated. 

 
3.7 Cation Exchange Capacity (C.E.C) estimation. 

 
C.E.C was estimated by the Ammonium Acetate method (NH3) and concentrations were 
measured using a Spectrometer with Lithium-Ion Battery Hach DR 2800. A total of 
thirteen samples were collected selectively according to layer charge criteria, This were 
the same samples that later on were use for Organophilization and the intention behind 
CEC determination was to estimate the quantity of amine necessary for effective 
Organophilization, Hence the clay-organic interaction was used to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the process and to corroborate the trend observed for the layer charge 
distribution as a function of depth, provided that the two parameters should be directly 
correlated.

1. About 0.5 g of the&amp;lt;1?m fractions was dried for 3 hrs at 105ºC and placed in 
centrifuge tubes; about 0.3g of dry sample was used to determine CEC. 

2. 10 ml of 1M ammonium acetate were added in the tubes and the clay 
suspensions were agitated for 1 hour. Afterwards the solution was decanted. A 
second saturation with 1M ammonium acetate took place under continuous 
agitation for 24 hours. 

3. Then the samples were  rinsed four times with ethanol (30 ml each time), to 
remove excess acetate. 

4. Subsequently the samples were leached with 25 ml of potassium chloride 1M 
three times. The the supernatant solutions were stored and the volume was 
made up to 100 ml. 

5. The ammonium concentration in the solution was measured in the  
spectrophotometer following this steps 

a. The solutions were diluted to 5% to be in the absorbance range of the 
equipment8. 

b. Then 3 drops of Mineral Stabilizer, 3 drops of Polyvinyl Alcohol 
Dispensing Agent and 1 ml of Nessler Reagent were added and the 
solutions were allowed the reaction to occur for 1 minute. 

c. The Polyvinyl Alcohol Dispersing Agent aids formation of yellow color 
after reaction of Nessler Reagent with ammonium ions. The color 
intensity is proportional to the ammonium concentration. The 
absorbance values obtained were then transformed into ammonium 
concentration according to the curve shown in Figure 6

After concentration is known then we proceeded establish the relationship between this 
value and CEC as it is shown at table 6 located in the section of this documents that 
refers to Organophilization. 

 

3.8 Layer charge determination. 
 

Being the main object of this study to establish precisely if the layer charge is 
systematically distributed in the bentonite bed, the estimation of the layer charge was 
carried out by two methods. One of them inlvolved observing XRD patterns after  
potassium saturation and ethylene glycol solvation of the clay samples and subsequent 
comparison with XRD simulated traces calculated from three component interlayering 
(Christidis &amp;amp; Eberl, 2003). The profile fitting is done with a excel sheet that was an output 
of this investigation and offers at the same time two different ways to compare the 
measured XRD values to the data base of the LayerCharge program (Christidis &amp;amp; Eberl, 
2003). (1)-Whole profile fitting (2) - peak position fitting. Both values were calculated and 
are discussed in the results chapter.  

Figures 6 and 7 show a screen displayed of the two methods provided by the program of 
layer charge determinations described before

Figure 7 - Layer charge determination by peak position method 

 

The second method uses the structural formula calculation (Schultz, 1969; Newman 
Eberl et al.,1986; Newman and Brown 1987; Onal, 2006) from the data obtained by XRF 
chemical analysis results in &amp;lt;1 ?m samples. This last method will also provide enough 
information about the octahedral and tetrahedral distribution of the layer charge. 

 

A slight correction was perform to SiO2 values of chemical data to establish a reliable 
structural formula for montmorillonite. In the XRD traces it is possible to notice the 
presence of quartz, which has a tendency to decrease as a function of depth. A semi 
quantitative determination of quartz was made from the 101 reflection, which was 
subsequently subtracted from the SiO2 determined by XRF. The figure 8 shows an 
example of the C profile, were the XRD pattern of K saturated, EG solvated&amp;lt;1 ?m 
oriented slides at 1.4 m depth contains ca 10% of Quartz, and the one at 8.3 m is just 
above the detection limit for quartz9, 1%.

Note: Conclusions about Layer charge heterogeneity will derive from Christidis &amp;amp; Eberl 
method and layer charge octahedral or tetrahedral location from structural formula 
method.  
 3.9 Organophilization 
 
The purpose of preparing  organo-clay complexes in this study was to evaluate the 
influence of layer charge variance in Melo bentonite deposit on the capability to interact 
in one of most significant industrial applications of these materials. Most variables were 
fixed like: type, concentration of dodecylammonium chloride (C12H28ClN) and preparation 
of amine, ageing time, montmorillonite size fraction and amount, etc. Moreover, 
conditions on which organophilization was performed for all samples can be considered 
equal. 
 
We used 12 samples selected according to layer charge criteria. The whole C profile was 
treated as a model for possible trends observed, and also samples F2 M1, F2 M2, F2 
M5, F2 M7, F2 M8 and F2 M9. Profile F2 had a similar overall trend but some deviations 
in layer charge values as a function of depth was the reason why it was selected. Only 
the&amp;lt;1?m powder was used and the procedure followed is described below, per samples 
and they where prepare with the following: 

1. About 0,5 g of the&amp;lt;1?m samples were saturated three times with Na using 30 ml 
of NaCl. After last saturation the samples were left overnight under mechanical 
agitation.

2. After washing the samples with deionized water four times, they were dispersed in 
dodecylammonium chloride solution 5 times. After the last run the centrifuge tubes 
where covered and kept for 24 hrs at 60 °C. 

3. Subsequently the samples were washed five times with methanol and oriented 
slides were prepared also using methanol containing the organophilic clay. Due to 
the volatility of methanol the samples were dried rapidly (2,5 hr) and then they 
were placed in a desiccator to avoid moisture adsorption caption until X-ray 
diffraction analysis. 

4. Dodecylammonium chloride solution was prepared by dissolving 18,5 gr of the 
amine into a mixture of 500 ml of deionized water and 100 ml of ethanol. Keeping 
a record of the pH change, 47.1 ml of 2M HCl was added to the solution up to a 
pH value of ca 7.3. and then 27,5 ml of 0.1 M HCl were used  to avoid exceeding 
neutral pH. After 5 min of stable pH measurements the solution was completed 
with deionized water up to 1L and was stored for the organophilization 
experiments. 

 
3.9.1 -The sorption of organic compounds 
 
The sorption of organic compounds was evaluated by XRD after organophilization using 
the principles described by Boyd and Jaynes (1994) about the role of layer charge in 
organic contaminant sorption by organoclays Also TGA will provide another evaluation 
parameter by comparing thermal stability and weight loss as a function of temperature 
before and after Montmorillonite is intercalated.  
 
 
 
 
 

CHAPTER IV 
Results 

4.1 - Planning  
 

The figure 9 shows the original program as it was structured is order to achieve the goals 
described before. However, during the progress of the research it was necessary to 
make some adjustment, particularly due to malfunctioning on some of the analytical 
equipment in both laboratories involved. However roughly it represents pretty well the

Some adjustments that worthwhile mentioning: 
 

a) XRF was not done in Brazil, therefore results for chemical analysis were 
delivered in Mid August. 

 
b) Greene-Kelly test was not performed due to time limitations, consequently 

any conclusions about the Tetrahedral or Octahedral nature of layer charge 
will be based upon results of XRF chemical analysis for the less than 1 
micron size fractions of the samples. 

 
c) Layer charge estimation from oriented slides potassium saturated and 

Ethylene Glycol solvated was done in Brazil for most samples. However 3 
samples had to be reevaluated in Greece because the XRD patters where 
not totally satisfactory, since the ethylene glycol evaporated before 
diffraction. 

 
d)  Transmission Electron microscopy was not performed 
 

 
4.2 -Field work 

 
On March 24 a 3 days field trip to Melo began, with the following objectives: 
 

1. Collect fresh samples from the mining fronts available.

2. Discuss with the mining company representatives in order to get access to some 
basic topographical data and their own perspective of the field. 

 
3. Visit other Bentonite concurrencies on the nearby area and observe the local 

geological context. 
 
4. Share Prof. Norberto Dani’s ideas about the diagenetic environment and probable 

alteration conditions that could lead to conclusions later on in the research.  
 

All objectives where achieved on the field work and the following Figures try to resume 
results. Figure 10 shows a map where all drill bores are plotted over the actual 
topography and in the extrapolated frame the spatial description of the 10841.35 m 2 
area enclosed by the polygon created by the 4 sampled points10.

4.2.1 - Sampling criteria 

 
Four profiles were studied to establish a tridimensional view of Layer charge distribution 
and other relevant properties. Two of them, named F1 and F2 where fresh cut sampled 
on the mining front at the open cut. Profile F2 is 8.2 m high and consists of 9 samples 
taken by macroscopic differences and other features as shown in the figure 11. Profile F1 
on the other hand only has 3 representative samples for top, middle area and bottom in 
order to reduce the quantity of material to be analyzed without losing the volumetric 
perspective of the whole study. Profiles B an C belong to boreholes taken by a research 
team from the UFRGS in 2009 (Delfino et al. ,2010).  
 
Three samples of these profiles are kept in the Geological department of that University. 
Profile B corresponds to the original BC 1-2 and C to B2. Five samples where taken from 
each profile from depths that had apparent correlation, with the intention to establish a 
long range horizontal comparison. 
 
 

B 1,75 m B 3,3 m B 5,2 m B 6,2 m B 8,2 m 

 
  

  

Figure 12 - Example of profile B sampling from bore holes. 
 
It is evident that each sample has a defined and unique macroscopic appearance 
compared to others in the same profile. They were selected according to this divergences 
not with the intention to expect dramatic property changes from one to another, but to be 
able to correlate the horizons among the 4 profiles assuming that hence we found that 
they is roughly continuous log profile with depth having similar macroscopic appearance 
over the levels, then we are able to establish long range correlation. The main 
macroscopic observation are variations on the sand content, levels of high iron oxide, 
levels of what appears to be magnesium oxides and levels that can be called pure 
montmorillonitic. The following graph presents the spatial distribution of samples taken.

Figure 13  -Spatial distribution of samples. 

 
 
Is important to outline here that some geometrical assumptions had to be impose to the 
3d model in order to achieve a coherent graphical representation. These constraints are: 
 
 
 

a) We assume that the longitudinal separation between profiles is 25 m. 
b)  Inner angle between any profile and the neighboring two is 90º, forming a 

perfect square on the surface. 
c) Vertical projections and sampling depth are kept intact. 
d) The slight slope shown in the topographic map is omitted. 
 

 
4.3 – Mineral Phases identification and Proportions. 
 
From whole rock XRD traces of random powder samples, it was possible to observe a 
variation on the mineralogical distribution as a function of depth on all profiles. Major 
mineral phases indentified where: dioctahedral smectite12 and quartz, with K-feldspar and 
albite as minor component (Fig. 14). One of the 21 samples (profile C at 1.4 m depth) 
contains a small proportion of illite.  Graph 14 shows the XRD trace of the randomly

oriented whole rock sample C 6.0 m, this sample can be considered as a typical XRD 
pattern of the Melo bentonite throughout all profiles.

m depth). Mont: smectite, Q: Quartz, Fldsp: Felspar 

 
Randomly oriented XRD traces for all samples belonging to the fresh cut Profile F1 are 
shown in Fig. 15,. In this profile is possible to observe how the proportions of smectite vs 
Quartz change with depth by comparing the relative intensities of the (001) smectite peak 
at 15 Å with the Quartz peak at 3.34 Å (101). Both phases are abundant at 2.1 m depth, 
then deeper the smectitic material tends to dominate over other phases up to a depth of 
7.3 m were the sample can be considered essentially as monomineralic with traces of 
quartz and feldspar.

4.4 - Chemical analysis 
Results obtained from XRF chemical analysis are consistent with the trend observed in 
diffraction patterns as a function of Depth; Table 3 presents a summary of chemical data 
arranged as in decreasing depth for all profiles. Likewise loss on ignition has a clear tend 
to increase with increasing depth due to a increasing smectite content and therefore 
greater weight loss from dehydration and dehydroxylation. Figure 15 presents all values 
of Loss on Ignition as a function of depth.

Figure 16 - Loss on Ignition for whole rock samples as a function of depth 

 
Some relevant features observed on chemical analysis results from whole rock lead us to 
several comclusions about the fluctuations on mineralogical proportions and about the 
migration of elements thought the profile. We will slighty point them out here and they will 
be discussed further on in the document. 
 

? Decrease of SiO2 and increase of Al2O3 contents are in accordance with  
observations in random XRD traces and LOI about increasing clay content as a 
function of depth. 

? Increase of CaO with depth is probably associated with  smectite interlayer.  
? K2O and Na2O both tend to decrease with depth, suggesting that probably 

there is not a single feldspar phase and they are decreasing as a function of 
depth, similar to quartz at the expense of Ca –Montmorillonite. We can state 
that albite and K-feldspar are present in Melo. 

? Fe2O3 content along the profiles tends to have a non-systematic behaviour, 
probably due to the presence of some oxides not detected by XRD. There is a 
general trend to increase with depth, suggesting that it is located basicaly as 
octahedral substitutions (as Fe3+).  

? MgO also tends to increase with depth. It is relatively high along the profile (up 
to more than 6%). Magnesium is present as octahedral substitution and is 
perhaps the major factor for high layer charge on all samples. 

? Other interesting features can be deduced from TiO2 being more abundant at 
the middle of the bed. This feature could have important implications in terms 
of the known tendency of Ti to be an immobile element and diagenetic 
characteristics that will be discussed later on.

?  P2O5 is present in  very low amounts and located only in boreholes B and C. If 
these locations are plotted on the base map with respect to the other two 
sampling locations, one can notice that these two samples are located in the 
middle, whereas F1 and F2 are in the northwest boundaries of the occurrence. 
The same trend was observed in chemical analyses of the&amp;lt;1?m size fractions.

4.5 - Heavy minerals and Geological overview  
In order to gather information about the whole diagenetic environment of Bañado de 
Medina Bentonites, we have separated the particle size between 53 µm and 100?m by 
wet sieving to observe heavy minerals and overall morphology. Observations were 
performed by SEM and by petrographic analysis using optical microscopy The following 
sequence of images resume what was found.

Opal-CT spherules. These textures are 
rather common, particularly in the high 
montmorillonitic levels of the bentonite 
(polarized microscope crossed polars). 

Typical textures of devitrified glass; 
quartz may form keeping the 
original appearance.(polarized 
microscope plane polarized light). 

A view of a series of Opal-CT 
manifestation surrounded by a 
very particular set of grains to 
give an idea of the grain size 
distribution and shapes. 

   
Figure 17 Observed features on SEM and Optical Microscope. The observed spherulitic 
textures are typical for devitrified volcanic glass glass. Although opal-CT was not 
detected in XRD traces the characteristic spherulitic textures probably belonged originally 
to opal-CT which was replaced by recrystallization to quartz, or very unlikely but possibly, 
it is still is preserved but in small amounts.  
 
Either opal-CT or quartz may form from crystallization of the volcanic glass. That means 
that the quartz present in the deposit could have been derived either from opal-CT or 
could have been formed directly from divitrification of volcanic glass.   
 
 
 
4.6 -Layer charge estimation and spatial variations

compared to XRD simulated traces calculated from three component interlayering.

Figure 18- XRD of C profile&gt; 1 ?m fraction as specified in the method. 
 
Samples were prepared in batches of 5 at a time to avoid ethylene glycol evaporation 
before X-ray diffraction, and the 005 smectite reflection was used as a tracer for efficient 
glycolation. This represents a key factor when trying to fit profiles on the Layer Charge 
software used to calculate layer charge.  
 
In Figure 18 the overall tendency of layer charge as a function of depth is not very clear. 
Therefore the Figure 19 zooms on the area where the largest smectite peak appears to 
remark the trend to decrease layer charge on top and bottom of the deposit or in other 
words to increase in the middle.

Depth. 
 
 
The Christidis &amp;amp; Eberl (2003) approach, offers two ways to estimate layer charge, the 
whole pattern method and the peak position method. In this research we have applied 
both methods and used the average as the definite result. As a general rule we have 
established that these values are in general in good agreement although it was noted 
that for layer charge greater than 0.51 e/huc this was not always the case. Therefore in a 
general way, if the spread between the two values is above 45% of the whole dispersion 
on the range of values from all profiles, then the best fit was selected.

Table 4 - Resume of results from layer charge calculations according to the Christidis &amp;amp; 
Eberl (2003) method. The smectite 005 peak at ca 3.4 Å was used as an indicator of 

efficient glycol solvation. 
 
From these values we can plot directly layer charge vs. depth to detect any cryptic 
variation of layer charge in terms of its spatial distribution. It is observed that 3 profiles 
showed a very clear tendency for increase of layer charge towards the middle of the bed. 
Only profile 1 behaves differently having values almost constant along the profile. 
Nevertheless it is necessary to explain that Profile F1 consists only of three samples, and 
they were taken from the mining front that has been exposed to weathering. For these 
two reasons the profile is the least reliable source of information.  
 
The following sequence of three graphs presents the clear and repeated trend of layer 
charge distribution mentioned before

4.5.2 – Spatial distribution of layer charge  
Using the same graphical inferences as those used in “the spatial distribution of 
samples”, we present a graph with a color scale to illustrate the spatial distribution of 
layer charge according to the average values obtained for all samples from they’re XRD 
traces. 
 

 
Figure 23 – 3D model of spatial distribution of layer charge.  
 
We also made an attempt to develop a volume model. Nevertheless the data was not 
sufficient to provide with a satisfying representation. The software used was Golden 
Softer Voxler 3 and it interpolates also in three dimensions, linearly in this case. In the 
present study we considered only a small area surrounding the axes; hence the graphical 
representation approaches reality. 
It is important also to distinguish that values for layer charge obtained from borehole 
samples13 seem to have a more coherent behavior in terms of rational evolution along 
the profiles.

4.6.3 – Layer charge calculations by the Structural Formula (SF) Method  
As it was already explained before, the SF method of layer charge calculation will be 
used to corroborate the trends observed with the first method and also to be able to 
approach the nature and amount of isomorphic substitutions that could help us to 
understand how layer charge diverges spatially. 
For this task the main Input is chemical analysis of the&amp;lt;1?m size fraction acquired with 
XRF.  

 
Table 5- XRF Chemical analysis results for&amp;lt;1um size fraction for all samples. 

 
Quartz in excess observed on XRD &amp;lt;1 µm fraction is rather frequent in this samples. To 
avoid overestimation of SiO2 in the structural formula calculation, a semi quantitative 
method was used to establish roughly quartz content and this amount was subtracted 
from the initial chemical composition. Table 6 shows the quartz content on the &amp;lt;1 ?m 
size fraction as a function of depth in profile C.

4.7 - Organophilization &amp;amp; Cation Exchange Capacity 
 
Cation exchange capacity was estimated to determine the proportion of amine that shall 
be used in the procedure. The amount of dodecylammonium Chloride (C12H28ClN)that 
will be used should be 1 to 1.5 time the CEC value, It was calculated by ammonium 
acetate method and some results are shown in table 8

It is well known that C.E.C should be directly proportional to layer charge. The 
following figure plots six values of C.E.C calculated as a function of their layer charge 
to try and observe the classic correlation.

ranging low values of CEC and Layer charge too; the blue one encloses the opposite 

group having High CEC and Layer charge.  

After organophilization took place, controlling all variables in order to assure that the 

same conditions repeated for all samples. Oriented slides were prepared on methanol 

solution and after dried they were kept in a desiccator to avoid moisture adsorption 

until X-Ray diffraction.  

Once in diffraction our only interest was to find out 001 d-spacings of all samples and 

to determine if there was any influence of layer charge on this. Diffraction range was 

set from 2º theta to 20º theta for the 001 reflection peak would be enough to gather 

conclusions about dodecylammonium Chloride intercalation.  Figure 27presents 

several diffraction patterns on oriented slide for a single sample to have a 

comparative overview.

peak at 17,46 Å is characteristic of a Bilayer amine intercalation, nevertheless this issue 

will be largely discussed in next chapter. 

At a first glance, all Organophilic xrd patterns show a similar expandability in terms of 

they’re 001 (C12H28ClN)-Montmorillonite peak position, ranging from 17,05 Å To 17,68 Å. 

They could all be considered as bilayer sorbed Organoclay according size of the alkyl 

chain used, and the known sorption isotherm (Boyd and Jaynes, 1994).  

Despite the slight d-spacing differences among samples, there is a well defined positive 

relationship between layer charge and position of the 001 peak of the organofilic 

smectites. This is a clear indication that the position of the 001 peak is related to the 

magnitude of layer charge.  

 
Figure 28  - Organophilic 001 peak position for C profile as a function of layer 
charge. 

An interesting trend was observed when the peak position was plotted vs depth; the d-
spacing increases towards middle of the Bentonite bed, and decreasing again towards 
the bottom, similar to the variation of layer charge, exhibited on Fig. 29.

information about relative proportions of mineral phases present in a multimineralic 
sample.  In our case we assume that is pure smectite interacting with dodecylammonium

Chapter V 
Discussion of results 

 
5.1 -Regarding Geological observations 
Bañado de Medina represents a very rear opportunity to study a bentonite deposit that 
seems to be unaffected since the early Permian in order to observe alteration features 
that may have influenced all physical and chemical properties of the smectites present. 
As it has been stated before in other investigations, we found evidence of a rhyolitic to 
Dacidic volcanic source from opal-CT and quartz texture. To approach the question of 
preservation conditions we accept the fact that e geological context linked to a 
intracratonic basin (Paraná Basin) was dominated by a rather low diagenetic conditions, 
a maximum temp of around 55 ºC was estimated from vitrinite analyses of a coal Bed 
that belongs to Rio Bonito formation( L. Calarge et al 2001). However, this is not 
sufficient to explain neither the atypical thickness for a stratiform layer of Bentonite 
developing from volcanic ash alteration over lagoon to transitional environment that can 
arise up to almost 6 m or the preservation from erosion, weathering and other surface 
related degradation processes. If volcanic ashes were so voluminous that in a lagoonal 
environment a bed of 6 m thickness was formed, then we would have to ask , what 
happened to the surrounding material derived from this events considering that the 
volcanic source is located more than 1000 km away?  
 
On the other hand, the spatial evolution on mineralogical composition indicates a clear 
tends to decrease trace minerals as quartz and feldspar to an increment of magnesium 
rich dioctahedral montmorillonite which electrical disequilibrium tends to be compensated 
primarily by Ca+ cations in the interlayer. XRD patterns on whole rock, XRF chemical 
results and heavy minerals observations and all in agreement with mineralogical 
proportion evolution as a function of depth. But if this is the case, why is there not a 
single trace of I/S mixed layer over the top of the deposit where smectite proportions are 
around 50% of the overall mineral composition and Na is present within Albite. The only 
evidence of Illite shown on XRD is traces was found at 1.5 m depth having a relatively 
small refection and clearly pure Illite, what lead’s us tu think that it is provably from 
detrital origins hence transition mixed layered phases are totally absent.  
 
As a consequence we can propose that as a locally, there is  a model that can explain all 
uncertainties expressed before by means of structural and mineralogical arguments 
registered in this research. We believe that a set of parallel oriented faults described by 
ALbarnaz et al,2010; had buried part of the original diagenetic bed, hence the deposit at 
Melo is actually modelled by taking two equally oriented faults as boundaries, above this 
limits drill bores resulted with no signals of Bentonite. Moreover, It is likely that 
surrounded overlying Bentonites where then transported and carrying larger content of 
accessory minerals. This could explain the great thickness of the bed and uneven 
distribution of mineral phases as a function of depth.  It would also explain why this rather 
small occurrence has preserved for such a long time and surrounded areas that most 
probably were also containing Bentonite has now been eroded. This hypothesis could set

important prospecting criteria to search for Bentonite occurrences regionally, particularly 
considering the large distance to the volcanic ash source. 
    
5.2 -Regarding layer charge spatial distribution, heterogeneity and nature. 
 
Although this is not the first attempt to interpret how layer charge is distributed over a 
Bentonite deposit (Christidis &amp;amp; Warren Huff, 2009) in order to correlate this behavior to 
formation characteristics, it is probably the first time that the layer charge distribution is 
approached in a tridimensional perspective and it is directly associated with properties 
like organophilization.  
We observed an overall tendency in three of the 4 profiles (18 from the 21 samples 
analyzed) for layer charge to increase up to values ranging from 0.5 to 0.56 electrons per 
half formula unit at the middle of the Bed and decrease at the top and bottom to values 
ranging from 0.46 to 0.49 per half formula unit. It was also in agreement with cation 
exchange capacity results, in which samples tend to be polarized in two groups when 
plotting CEC vs. layer charge, one group having CEC 85-100 eq.mol/100g and lower 
layer charge values, and the other group having CEC 100-120 eq.mol/100g and higher 
layer charge values. 
Furthermore, the &amp;lt;1 µm size fractions are characterized by higher Mg and Al contents as 
a function of depth, both cations being present mostly in octahedral sites. However the 
rate of increase of Al with depth is greater than the remaining octahedral located cations. 
This would affect gradually the magnitude and distribution of layer charge as was 
observed along the research.

he fact that the Bentonite bed is placed over a sandstone layer could have created 
alteration conditions in which the water/ rock ratio along the profile would form a greater 
number of octahedral substitutions in the middle of the deposit and consequently higher 
layer charge.  

Profile P1 did not have a coherent behavior compared to the other three profiles, perhaps 
because samples were obtained from the oldest exposed mining front; only three 
samples were taken from this location and although the layer charge values were on the 
same range we did not observe the same systematic trend with depth. As a general 
remark we can outline that results over the boreholes were largely more consistent than 
the ones obtained over fresh cut samples on mining fronts.  

 
 
5.3 - Regarding Organophilization and physical properties 
 
All Organophilic XRD patterns showed a similar d-spacing of the 001 (C12H28ClN)-
Montmorillonite complex, ranging from 17,05 Å to 17,68 Å. They could all be considered 
as bilayer complexes according to the size of the alkyl chain used, and the known 
sorption isotherm (Boyd and James, 1994). 

 

 
Figure 33 – Arrangement of Alkylammonium ions in mica-type silicates with different 

layer charges. A) Lateral Monolayer, B) Lateral Bilayer, C) Paraffin-type monolayer and 
D) Paraffin type bilayer.  

The basal spacing for each type of intercalation can be described as step wise. Inr mono-
bilayer transitions with samples having layer charge heterogeneity the transition can 
occur over a range of alkylammonium carbon chain length rather than in a single discrete 
step (Figure33).

Following this principles we were able to establish a linear trend on the XRD traces of 
(C12H28ClN)-smectite, between the 001 d-spacing of the organophilic smectites and the 
layer charge estimated prior to organophilization. Similar trend was observed between 
the layer charge and the net and raw peak areas of the resulting organophilic clays. 
Consequently we can expect that layer charge spatial distribution could have important 
influence on the quality of interaction of bentonites not only when organophilization is 
intended but for any other application based on physical properties of smectites present 
in bentonites.

5.4 -Conclusions 
 

1 – Layer charge spatial variation for the Bañado de Medina Bentonite deposit displays a 
clear tendency to increase at the middle of the bed. We believe that more important than 
the trend itself it is the fact that diagenetic processes and alteration implicit on Bentonite 
occurrences, tend to have a gradual cryptic, and rational distribution; directly relative to 
the formation characteristics and preservation afterwards. To use this mineral resource 
properly one needs to understand the specific emplacement of and distribution of 
octahedral and tetrahedral substitutions in smectite structure, for it is layer charge the 
driven force for all 2:1 phyllosilicates interaction in any application context.   
Therefore we could not expect that the tendency of layer charge spatial distribution 
observed could be extrapolated to other deposits of similar origins, but the basic 
principles should apply; even more important, by understanding it’s own formation 
context one could predict eventually what kind of layer charge spatial distribution a 
specific deposit could have. 

 
2 – The hypothesis offered in this document about the local conditions that lead to the 
preservation of the Melo Bentonite deposit, shall be further studied. Perhaps a way to do 
so would be simply by analyzing the evolution of heavy minerals and specific textures 
observed in quartz as a function of depth. Also the distribution of feldspar minerals could 
help to better understand which prospecting criteria could be used on the task to find 
similar bentonite occurrences regionally. 
 3 – A very clear correlation was observed by comparing XRD traces from organoclays, 
(C12H28ClN)-Montmorillonite, with the layer charge values. The most evident 
organophilicity efficiency as a function of layer charge was established by correlating 
layer charge spatial distribution with respect to amine intercalated 001 d-spacing peak 
area analysis. The 001 d-spacing of the organoclay tends to increase with increasing 
layer charge. The position of the 001 peak ranges between 17.15 Å and 17.5 Å and the 
raw 001 peak area after organophilization can vary from 2620.6(cps x deg)  to  418.8 
(cps x deg). They can all be considered as bilayer intercalated complexes. Nevertheless 
we can expect that the influence of layer charge spatial distribution could have more 
tangible effect when compared with other applications, such as acid activation or 
viscosity, because evaluation of results will not be presented over a stepwise expandable 
behavior typical of amine-clay interactions.  

4 – Some direct implications of these results could be applied to actual bentonite mining. 
It is the usual practice to estimate the quantity of reactants when trying to stimulate cation 
exchange according to the smectite proportion within the bentonite. Physical parameters 
like layer charge are considered to be fixed. This new approach would have an impact 
not only on the way bentonites are treated but also on the way they are mixed after 
extraction resulting probably in a more homogeneous material if the correct criteria of 
layer charge spatial variations are used.
