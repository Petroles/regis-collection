The aim of this dissertation is to appraise and critically reflect on the physical pertinence of 

governing equations and closure relations often used for the modeling of gas-phase transport 

phenomena in high-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). More precisely, this work 

conducts a critical literature review on the concentration-induced voltage losses (i.e., 

concentration polarization) resulting from mass transfer limitations. Thus, the overall object of 

this work was to stress awareness of the limits of mathematical models studied and developed 

in the SOFC literature to date, and which are specifically related to concentration polarization 

processes. To a great extent, the design of SOFC porous layers is likened to that of optimizing 

the transport of multicomponent gas mixtures in structured porous catalysts, for which 

diffusional and flow limitations are of cardinal importance. In both cases, severe 

inconsistencies in mass transport models cannot be simply ignored and the main uncertainties 

in utilizing such models should be clarified. It is hoped that the information herein will serve 

usefully to support future developments of more consistent theoretical frameworks, thereby 

improving the confidence on the results of numerical simulations. 

 
The critical literature review has been carried out so to identify a number of physical 

inconsistences, ill-defined approximations, and misleading mathematical derivations. Along the 

review, it is argued that the choice (or, more properly, the lack of conceptual refinement) of a 

particular mathematical model can significantly impair the “prediction” of transport processes 

relevant to concentration-induced power losses in SOFCs. One of the keystones of this work 

was therefore to re-interpret and thus to reassess the frequently contradictory literature related 

to certain classes of gas-phase transport models pertinent to the evaluation of concentration 

polarization. With this revisionary approach, it is expected that one could reduce confusion, 

clear up apparent contradictions, and improve the possibility of gaining new insights.

Esta dissertação tem o objetivo de avaliar e refletir criticamente sobre a pertinência física de 

equações de conservação e de relações de fechamento, frequentemente utilizadas na 

modelagem multiescala de fenômenos de transporte em células a combustível de óxido-sólido 

(SOFC). Dêu-se atenção especial ao escoamento em “microescala” de misturas gasosas 

multicomponentes, dentro de meios porosos quimicamente reativos. Em outras palavras, esta 

monografia busca ressaltar quais os limites para aplicação de certas classes de modelos 

matemáticos, os quais têm sido desenvolvidos e utilizados na literatura de SOFCs até o 

presente momento. O projeto de camadas porosas de SOFCs assemelha-se à tarefa de 

otimizar processos de transporte em catalisadores estruturados, para os quais a existência de 

limitações de transporte por difusão e por escoamento tem importância primordial. Por esta 

razão, inconsistências originadas em modelos de fenômenos de transporte  não podem ser, 

simplesmente, negligenciadas e, portanto, as principais incertezas ao se utilizar tais modelos 

devem ser devidamente esclarecidas. Espera-se, com efeito, que as informações contidas 

neste trabalho sejam úteis para futuros desenvolvimentos teóricos mais consistentes, de 

forma a aumentar a confiabilidade no uso de resultados obtidos por simulações numéricas.

1.1 Aim of the Dissertation Work 

The analysis of solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operation is a technically challenging task, 

which involves the appraisal of multiple chemical and physical phenomena that cannot be 

assessed under a single scientific paradigm, thus requiring multi-physics tools for the credible 

description of SOFC behavior. In this regard, mathematical modeling and numerical simulation 

constitute a valuable tool in the evaluation of multi-physics phenomena in SOFCs, inasmuch 

as one can examine, in a relatively straightforward manner, the effects of different design 

parameters and operating conditions on fuel cell performance. Furthermore, in situations 

where multiple physical scales play a part, this performance is also governed by the interplay 

of microscopic processes whose simultaneous interaction can give rise to complex (and often 

nonintuitive) coupling effects associated to disparate space and time scales, ultimately 

affecting the macroscopic (“experimentally observable”) performance of SOFCs. It is thus 

unlikely that simplified single-scale models are able to accurately depict the performance of all 

individual components of a system (see Fig. 1.1), when the macroscale manifestation of 

microscale physics stem from such complex process convolution. In this case, the competence 

to make an otherwise scale-resolved appraisal of SOFC operation relies on a multiscale 

modeling approach
[ 1, 2]

.  

Although truly faithful multiscale models of any complete fuel cell system are in principle 

impossible to attain, excess use of empiricisms and usage of distributed-parameter models in 

the SOFC literature (i.e., when these are misused and misinterpreted) help to further obscure 

the physical meaning of a number of natural processes that one is trying to describe, thus 

precluding a reliable interpretation of both numerical simulation results and experimental data. 

In this context, it is expected that this dissertation work will provide a useful contribution and 

fulfill the particular need for a better theoretical judgment of a few but important topics related 



Chapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 2 
 

to the computational modeling of gas-phase transport phenomena, which are necessary to the 

evaluation of concentration polarization (concentration-induced voltage losses) in high-

temperature SOFCs. By bringing the discussion of such topics to the fore, one hopes to unveil 

the strong contrast between the real complexity of SOFCs and the crudity of some of the 

mathematical modeling techniques frequently used in the literature.

During the laborious task of understanding and reviewing the body of literature, it was 

found that many pertinent remarks and critical assessments on mass transport, relevant to 

SOFC modeling, had been already drawn by authors from late 50’s until late 90’ s. However, 

equally many of those findings have been either obscured over the years or disregarded by 

unfavorable, cursory analyzes. Therefore, although limiting the literature review to only recent 

and high impact publications constitutes a prolific research path, a drawback of this choice is 

the possibility to stumble upon some “vicious circle” of a defective theory or model. In this 

case, presumably, “hidden issues” remain to be dealt with at a later time, as appear necessary 

to the researcher concerned enough to controvert the views on that theory. On the other hand, 

the in-depth scrutiny of all current theories on mass transport constitutes a near impossible 

undertaking. Such endeavor would certainly entail an overwhelming store of existing 

knowledge, and for this reason an all-embracing scrutiny of existing theories was not pursued 

in this dissertation. Moreover, it would be also a substantial undertaking to overturn the vested 

assumptions (and long-held preconceived interests) of an entire class of consolidated 

modeling frameworks that have been produced by scholars from past generations. 

 



Chapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 3 
 

Therefore, neither new mass transfer theories will be introduced nor will be the existing 

theories significantly advanced in the pages that follow. This is to say that the present work is 

not about the much-needed critical review and reconciliation of the phenomenological theory of 

transport phenomena with the results from statistical mechanics or extended non-equilibrium 

thermodynamic theories. Even though the current distance between applied 

mathematicians/physicists and engineers (especially chemical engineers) has become 

somewhat large, with the current macroscale phenomenological theory still mired in misleading 

and erroneous assumptions made by previous models devised at the beginning of 20th 

century
1
, the analyses in this work have been confined to a chiefly revisionary character, 

covering only an superset of existing modeling techniques that have been applied specifically 

in the SOFC literature, without scrutinizing, however, the actual theoretical foundation on which 

such techniques has been built. 

The fact that more fundamental underlying theories (which, as mentioned above, are 

fallible to their nature) will not be analyzed in this work does not prevent the author from 

critically reviewing and appraising, without significant loss of pertinence and generality, the 

mathematical models that were developed using these theories in order to assess 

concentration polarization effects in SOFCs. The justifying reason is that these mathematical 

models have been, nevertheless, successfully applied to understand and predict natural 

processes of scientific and engineering interest in the field of SOFC research. That said, 

however, and more so given that the limitations of the founding theory are not well known, 

these modeling techniques are not without identifiable trade-offs and, first and foremost, 

without limits of validity. Thus, even though the scrutiny of existing mass transfer theories is 

not a plausible alternative in this dissertation, one should still justify the physical pertinence 

and perceive the uncertainties of derived mathematical models (“superset of modeling 

techniques”). With such critical perspective, it is of interest of this work to revisit a number of 

models on transport phenomena that have been applied to the modeling of mass transport in 

SOFCs, motivated by the following concerns and considerations: 

I. Try to identify ambiguities when evaluating “cause-effect” relations, which are 

typical of lumped (distributed) parameter models. On this wise one would be able 

to properly recognize what factors are causing the system to behave in one way 

and not another. This level of distinction is relevant from both equipment 

engineering and optimization perspectives. Even though there are times when a 

simplified description for the physical system is necessary, the undervaluation of 

model’s simplifying assumptions may render experimental conclusions biased. 

                                                      
1
 Some of the shortcomings of the so-called (linear) phenomenological transport theory, or of any theory based on 

the macroscale-continuum hypothesis, are related to the inability or limitation of this theory in accounting for the 
fact that the properties of gas systems can depend on the details about the magnitude and motions of their more 
basic constituents (molecules). 



Chapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 4 
 

II. Discuss mathematical models for their advantages and limitations (i.e., trade-offs), 

taking into consideration the credibility of model predictions based on the 

evidence of uncertainties that are associated with modeling errors. Ultimately, this 

should permit a more accurate picture of fuel cell macroscale performance. 
 

III. It is plausible (and practical) that physical models may have a number of 

undisclosed assumptions and emphasis not spelled out in words that are, at some 

level, familiar to those researchers accustomed to the scientific field wherein these 

models have been applied. The disciplined use of simplifying assumptions (that is, 

to make a simplifying assumption based on substantiated grounds) necessarily 

involves, to some extent, a bit of common sense (within that particular scientific 

field) and also some “educated guess” about the importance (impact) of the 

specific assumption being made. However, if one fails to disclose a large number 

of important physicochemical assumptions, rationalized hypotheses are 

irretrievably shadowed by fallacious arguments. Thus, a simplifying assumption 

can only be that which allows simplifying the analysis and must not affect the 

physicochemical behavior one is trying to examine or demonstrate. In other 

words, it must not constitute a critical assumption that can undermine the proper 

description of that behavior. 

 
Most of the developments in Chapter 4 are in the lines of what was just introduced 

above, which is of a critical review driven by the importance of thoroughly understanding the 

model’s assumptions, including the identification of possible physical inconsistences, ill-defined 

approximations, and misleading mathematical derivations, where these are deemed as 

relevant factors in the model prediction capability. On the other hand, the discussions 

presented in Chapter 2 (more precisely in §§2.3) and in Chapter 3 (more precisely in §§3.3) 

go beyond the mere revisionary task; instead they propose some new analyses whose appeal 

is chiefly theoretical and whose value is the disambiguation of important concepts often 

misprized and/or misrepresented in the SOFC literature, but which are nonetheless critical to 

the proper definition and thus the evaluation of concentration-induced voltage losses. 

Finally, it should be (once more) underlined that this work lacks a focused assessment 

of multicomponent mass transfer theories based on idealized “capillary pore spaces”, which 

are frequently used as a modeling abstraction for the pore-level information in macroscale 

phenomenological models. In this respect, the description of what (supposedly) occurs at the 

pore level represents additional sources of flagrant oversimplifications (i.e., misrepresentations 

of transport processes) made by many SOFC models, potentially undermining the correct 

evaluation of SOFC macroscale performance. This most critical topic is, however, beyond the 

scope of this dissertation. Even though the present work certainly establishes a relevant 

academic territory, it also readily recommends further research by acknowledging the 

previously mentioned limitation. 



Chapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 5 
 

 

This work has been subdivided into four (4) main chapters and a final chapter in which 

overall conclusions are drawn and an outlook for future works is proposed. These main 

chapters may be summarized as follows: 

? Chapter 1 (General Introduction): this chapter starts with a short introduction to 

solid-oxide fuel cell, its components, its principles of operation, and its key design 

features, all of which constitute a very basic and yet still necessary knowledge for 

understanding the physicochemical processes that will be addressed in later 

chapters. However, in order to not lose sight of the purpose of this work, these 

initial sections have been kept as simple as possible. Besides introducing more 

formal aspects of SOFCs, this chapter also provides an overview of what will be 

examined in the next chapters concerning the mathematical modeling of (single-

cell) SOFCs. 
 

? Chapter 2 (Preliminaries on the Physical Chemistry of SOFCs): the general 

(macroscopic) equilibrium thermodynamics of SOFCs is presented, followed by a 

short description of the main forms of irreversibilities (usually referred to as 

polarizations) associated with cells operating out of equilibrium. These 

polarizations ultimately lead to irreversible power losses, which are often 

quantified as voltage drops with respect to the cell reversible (“maximum”) 

thermodynamic voltage. A theoretical discussion has also been prepared on the 

precise definition of SOFC polarizations in order to pinpoint a number of 

inconsistencies found in the literature. 
 

? Chapter 3 (Mass Transport Limitations and Concentration Losses): in this chapter 

the main topic of concentration-induced voltage losses (“concentration 

polarization”) is introduced, wherein the concept of mass (and possibly 

momentum) transport limitations is related to other SOFC properties and 

processes such as electrochemical potentials, limiting (or saturation) current 

densities, Nernstian losses, kinetic (or surface overvoltage) losses, and other “less 

common” types of mass transfer cross-effects (e.g., Soret-Dufour and mechano-

chemical effects). 
 

? Chapter 4 (Modeling Techniques for Concentration Polarization): this chapter 

discusses the modeling techniques commonly used in the SOFC literature that are 

concerned to the evaluation of concentration polarization. The discussion is 

centered on governing equations and closure relations pertinent only to the “gas-

phase” (i.e., to reactive multicomponent gas flow). Inevitably, though, 

electrochemical reactions and charge transport are addressed as well for the sake 

of information completeness and contextualization of the problem being modeled 

(however, these topics are not treated at length since they are not the focus of this 

work). This section is in the lines of a “critical review”, serving the purpose of 

highlighting opportunities for improvement and clarification of existing models. 
 

  



Chapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 6 
 

 

 

Fuel cells have their origin in the conceptual idea of an efficient two-step fuel 

combustion process with generation of charged species as intermediates, as first asserted in 

1839 by the Swiss scientist Christian Friedrich Schoenbein, and later on materially realized by 

Sir William Grove
[ 4]

, who in the same year published the experimental observation of voltage 

in a concentration cell (when combining hydrogen and oxygen gases in the presence of 

platinum). The realization that fuel cells could theoretically produce electricity in a more 

efficient way than conventional (i.e., without bottoming-cycle) thermal engines was possible 

just after electrochemistry was connected with thermodynamics, in the end of the nineteenth 

century. Certainly, this finding became a captivating force drawing research and development 

efforts into pursing fuel cells as potential efficient power generation devices.  

The solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is an alternative energy-conversion device that 

converts the chemical energy stored in fuels (such as   ,   ,    ) into electricity, through a 

series of chemical and electrochemical reactions
[ 4]

. SOFC is a complete solid-state device that 

uses an ion-conducting ceramic material as the electrolyte, which is sandwiched in between 

two electrodes (anode and cathode, according to Fig. 1.2). SOFCs also produce a significant 

amount of heat (“byproduct”), which can be harnessed in combined heat and power (CHP) 

systems to take advantage of this wasted heat. Likewise, the excess of heat can also be used 

to sustain endothermic reforming reactions of certain hydrocarbons to produce H2-enriched 

gas for effectively fueling the SOFC. More specifically, SOFCs allow the use of a variety of 

fuels because the anode can serve as an active catalyst for fuel reforming at higher operating 

temperatures, typically in the range of 650 °C – 1000 °C
[ 4]

. 

Solid electrolyte materials, as used by modern solid-oxide fuel cells, were not identified 

until the end of the nineteenth century through the discovery of Walther Nernst
[ 5]

 of his so-

called “Nernst Mass”
2
.  It was a ceramic compound consisting of 85 %-mol      and 15 %-mol 

    , and since then this material has been applied as reference for many mixtures of      

with rare-earth and alkaline-earth oxides, with the objective of obtaining materials with high 

ionic conductivity
[ 6, 7]

. Until early 1990’s
[ 8]

,     -based materials have remained the 

mainstream electrolytes since the invention by Nernst more than one hundred years ago.

 Interesting enough, George Westinghouse was the assignor of Nernst’s invention in 1899

Chapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 8 
 

While conventional high-temperature SOFC (HT-SOFC) usually operates between 800 

°C and 1000 °C, in the period starting from early 2000’s there has been a number of groups
[ 9]

 

focusing on intermediate (typically operating between 650 °C and 800 °C) and low temperature 

(below 650 °C) SOFCs (IT-SOFC and LT-SOFC, respectively). Both designs allow wider 

choices of materials and more cost-effective systems. The lower operating temperature 

minimizes thermally-driven material degradation and reduces stringent material requirements. 

Therefore, this line of research tries to bring acceptable lifetime and competitive levelized cost 

of electricity (LCOE) to SOFC technology
5
. 

Due to their high theoretical efficiencies, SOFCs hold a great potential to deliver 

attractive economics for converting fossil fuels (or renewable fuels, such as ethanol and 

biogas) into useful forms of energy in a most efficient manner and with minimal environment 

impact, addressing world’s demand for clean and affordable energy. This is especially true 

when SOFC systems rely on CHP (i.e., bottoming-cycle with conventional thermal engines). In 

the foreseeable future, SOFCs might find particular application in the niche market of 

stationary, distributed power generation
[ 10]

, and perhaps also as a promising energy storage 

technology through use of the so-called reversible SOFCs
[ 11]

, when they are applied as solid-

oxide electrolyzer cells (SOECs) to produce hydrogen gas.  However, thus far there are still 

significant technical challenges inhibiting the full commercialization and wide-scale rollout of 

SOFC technology.   

Despite of the centenary history and the overall multibillion dollars investment over the 

past fifteen years, SOFCs are still somewhat far off from reaching commercial -grade 

performance in the market of power sources and achieving subsidy free energy prices (i.e., 

without requiring leverage subsidies through government policy making to be a competitive 

technology). There are a number of hindrances that need to be addressed before SOFC 

become poised for (a realistic) commercial market introduction. For instance
[ 4, 8, 9]

: 

i. There is still lack of knowledge about the fundamental aspects of SOFC operation, 

which still hides complex and poorly understood processes (from thermodynamics to 

kinetic phenomena) stemming from different and overlapping scientific domains. 
 

ii. High overall product cost (high capital expenditure), regarding both manufacturing 

and balance-of-plant (BOP) related costs. High temperature operation unequivocally 

requires exceptional properties of materials and assembled modules.  
 

iii. Not enough attention has been drawn to problems of SOFC insufficient long term 

durability and reliability, with direct impact on fixed and variable maintenance costs, 

as well as on the average capacity factor of SOFC power generation systems.

 LCOE represents the per-kilowatt hour cost (in real dollars) of building and operating a power plant over an 

assumed financial life and duty cycle. 



Chapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 9 
 

 

There are four basic functional elements in a SOFC: electrolyte, cathode, anode, and 

interconnect. The material for these components is typically ceramics, metals, or a cermet (see 

also §§1.3.4). More generally, a SOFC consists of two porous electrodes separated by a 

dense, oxide ion-conducting, ceramic electrolyte (see Fig. 1.3). These three layers when 

stacked together are often referred to as MEA (membrane-electrode assembly) or PEN 

(Positive-electrode/Electrolyte/Negative-electrode). When the PEN and interconnects are 

coassembled they form a single cell, which is typically only a few millimeters thick
[ 7, 8]

. The 

ceramics used in SOFCs do not become ionically active until it reaches high temperatures
6
. 

The structure of the electrode is porous to ensure that both the electrolyte from one 

side and gas from the other “can infiltrate it". This is to give the maximum possible contact 

between the electrode, the electrolyte, and the gas, given that phase boundary reactions occur 

at solid/solid/gas interfaces (at the so-called tree-phase boundary or TPB). Ideally, feed 

molecules have to be distributed over the TPB as uniformly as possible and products should 

be removed without significant difficulties. At this level of description, a SOFC resembles a 

chemical reactor that needs to be optimized with respect to geometry, materials, and operating 

conditions
[ 12]

.   

  

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

Figure 1.3: example of a cross-section scheme of ceramic layers in a planar cell (Figure by the author). 

 

The electric current produced by a SOFC scales with the active surface density (i.e., 

with the reaction regions where gas, electrode, and electrolyte meet). To increase this density, 

a huge number of catalyst particles are mixed with ionic and electronic conductors to form the 

functional layers of SOFC
[ 13, 8]

. Thoroughly interconnected pores in the close vicinity of TPB 

are needed to provide fast delivery of feed gas. However, even in well-engineered layers a 

large amount of particles might be “disconnected” (i.e., non-percolated) from the electrolyte or 

located far from the pore and are, therefore, “inactive” for electrochemical reactions.

 In this case, the observed electrical conductivity at high temperatures is attributed to the movement of oxygen 

vacancies under gradients of oxygen partial pressure

To understand how the reaction between fuel and oxygen produces an electric current, 

and where the electrons come from, one needs to consider the separate (half) reactions taking 

place at each electrode (see Fig. 1.4). Two electrochemical reactions are separated in space 

by an electrolyte (ionic conductor). For the reaction taking place at the cathode (also known as 

“air electrode”), oxygen gas molecules react with incoming electrons coming from the outer 

circuit to form oxide ions (i.e., convert    into  
  ), which then migrate across the electrolyte to 

the anode. At the anode (also known as “fuel electrode”), the fuel supply (  ,    or other 

hydrocarbon) accepts     delivered by the electrolyte and converts it into     (and/or    ), 

liberating electrons which flow from the anode via external load to the cathode. These 

electrons, flowing via external load, can be harnessed to do useful work (i.e., produce 

electricity). The cycle then repeats itself as those electrons enter the cathode material. 

 
Figure 1.4: schematics of the working principle of SOFCs. Example of separate anode and cathode reactions, 
when using hydrogen and carbon monoxide as fuels. Oxygen is usually obtained from air, although it may be fed 
pure (Figure by the author).  

 

To put it concisely: one of these reactions produces ions (i.e., electrons are added to a 

chemical species, and likewise electrons are “consumed” by the reaction), in a process defined 

as oxygen reduction reaction. The other reaction consumes ions (i.e., electrons are removed 

from a chemical species, and likewise electrons are liberated by the reaction), in a process 

defined as fuel oxidation reaction. The functionality of an electrolyte is to transport oxygen 

continuously, and solely in the form of     from cathode to anode, for which the overall driving 

force is the gradient of chemical potential of oxygen
[ 8]

 (with the anode having a lower partial 

pressure of oxygen). Provided that both fuel and oxygen are supplied constantly, continuous 

electrochemical reactions will steadily generate electricity.

The maximum cell voltage of a typical single SOFC typically reaches up to       (or 

about       when drawing a useful amount of electric current), depending on temperature, 

pressure, oxidant, and fuel consumption
[ 13]

. At such small voltage level, practical engineering 

applications will not be benefited. Thus, in order to build sufficient high voltage (e.g.,      ) 

and power throughput, multiple single cells have to be connected in series and/or parallel with 

the aid of interconnects. Such collection of SOFCs in series is known as “stack” (see Fig. 1.5). 

Ideally, interconnects should make connections all over the surface of one cathode to that of 

the anode of the next cell. Generally, interconnect is ribbed on both sides to allow cross -flow, 

co-flow, or counter-flow configurations of fuel/air flows (see Fig. 1.5).  

 Although a good electrical connection must be made between the two electrodes, their 

respective gas supplies must be strictly separated. That is, SOFC must allow oxygen transport 

only in the form of     (thus not in the form of unreacted   ). For that to be possible, dense 

barriers (e.g., electrolytes, interconnects, sealing gaskets, and so forth) between air and fuel 

streams have to be established to ensure that the two individual half reactions occur in 

isolation from one another. Ideally, interconnects should be pure electronic conductors and 

thus oxide-ion insulators. The electrolyte must only allow     ions to pass through it (i.e., it 

must be a pure ionic conductor, ideally). Otherwise, it would be possible for electrons to go 

across the electrolyte and not via the outer circuit and, in this case, the closed electrical circuit 

would be lost.

Chapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 12 
 

 

The intent here is to give just a brief overview about more common designs, which 

should be enough to support the concepts and definitions to be used throughout this 

dissertation. For a more complete description about “standard” SOFC designs, one should 

refer to [ 8, 13]. For newest designs, including the micro tubular single-chamber SOFCs, one 

should refer to [ 14]. 

Modern SOFCs typically consist of a thin electrolyte film and supporting substrate s 

(including porous or channeled dense bodies for gas transport). From a geometric standpoint, 

the substrate can be made into either tubular or planar shape (see Fig. 1.6). In terms of long-

term stability, the tubular concept has demonstrated the best results, while the planar design 

promises higher power densities
[ 8]

. The planar SOFC may be in the form of a circular disk 

(“ring type”) fed with fuel from the central axis, or it may be in the form of a rectangle or square 

plate fed from the edges (see Figure 1.6a). Planar designs can be broken down into 

electrolyte-supported, electrode-supported, interconnect-supported (metal or ceramic), inactive 

insulator-supported, or active insulator-supported designs (see Fig. 1.7). SOFC design is 

intimately related to a particular choice on how to stabilize the cell mechanically.

The selection of cell supporting design must consider additional performance 

constraints besides mechanical stabilization, such as: chemical stability and thermal expansion 

compatibility between layers; long-term durability; issues regarding fabrication techniques; 

voltage losses; and electrochemical catalysis
[ 8, 13]

. For instance, electrolyte resistance is a 

significant obstacle to further decrease the SOFC operating temperature, thus the 

manufacturing of thinner electrolytes is of major interest. This can be accomplished by shifting 

the function of mechanical stabilization from the electrolyte to one of the electrodes. In this 

concept
8
, existing anode materials tend to be preferred because they exhibit better electrical 

conductivity. Thus, in this case, no appreciable ohmic losses occur when the electrode 

thickness is increased (see Fig. 1.8). Moreover,   /    cermet anodes also have good 

mechanical stability, allowing larger planar cells to be produced.  

 
Figure 1.8: SEM image of an anode-supported cell (picture reproduced from [ 14]). 

 

A specific porous structure of thick substrate type is the so-called buffer-layer (also 

referred to as “anode-barrier”), which will be briefly presented in §§1.3.4.5.  Here it is anywise 

appropriate to add that the use of this type of substrate also implies performance constraints, 

as already mentioned above for other types of supporting designs. Usually, the buffer-layer is a 

substrate with high porosity and adequate gas permeability, but the trade-off is that it has 

much lower effective electrical conductivity
[ 15]

. Therefore, in the particular case that the buffer-

layer is also used for mechanical stabilization, the cell should be classified as an insulator-

supported design. A final and equally important concept is that of functional layers and 

composite (functionally graded) electrodes
[ 16]

. The latter is often made by laying down several 

layers, which allows a gradient of properties ranging from nearly pure electrolyte (e.g.,    ) at 

the electrolyte surface to almost pure electrode composition at the interconnect contact (see 

Fig. 1.9).

Although there are various different designs, SOFC composite electrodes often consist 

of a “superposition” of at least two layers: (i) one constituted by a pure ion-conducting material; 

and the other constituted by the electro-catalyst/electron-conducting material (e.g.,     , 

      ).  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 1.9: illustrative example of a composite electrode (cathode, in this case) and its functional layers: current 

collector layer with thickness  1; and cathode functional layer with thickness    (Figure by the author). 
 

Furthermore, each layer itself can be a mixture of one or more phases, with varying 

composition of each solid phase along the cell thickness (mixtures such as: pure ion-conductor 

with a mixed electron-ion-conductor; or a pure ion-conductor with a pure electro-conductor; 

see Fig. 1.10).  For instance, by layering the anode between two slightly different 

compositions, one nearest the zirconia with less nickel, the other near the gas stream with 

more nickel, can produce excellent anode properties, both from the catalytic (rapid reactions 

with the fuel) and conduction (good conduction to the interconnect) points of view
[ 13]

.

SOFC composite electrodes (e.g.,         for cathodes; and        for anodes) 

usually exhibits a superior performance compared to single phase electrodes, since the 

electrochemically active zone is spread into the electrode’s volume
[ 17] 

in the former case. That 

is, there is a performance increase attributed to an improved contact with the bulk electrolyte 

as well as to an extended TPB in the composite structure
[ 13]

. An extra substrate may also be 

added, e.g. on top of the anode, to perform some sort of additional catalytic/protection function 

(fuel reforming, as in the case of the buffer-layer), as will be succinctly discussed in §§1.3.4.5.

Chapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 15 
 

 

Because the analysis of SOFC materials itself is not within the scope of this work, only 

an essential overview is given about electrodes and electrolyte materials. The brief introduction 

that follows should provide a reasonable background to support familiarization with main 

terminology and to present some key materials characteristics as well. Throughout this 

dissertation, however, a more in-depth examination of SOFC materials will be done promptly 

when deemed necessary for complete comprehension of a given topic. 

 

The electrolyte is exposed to both oxidizing (air side) and reducing (fuel side) 

atmospheres at high temperatures. Such grueling conditions require that, in order to attain 

successful, long-term operation and maximum electrochemical efficiency, the electrolyte 

should have the following characteristics
[ 8]

: (i) high ionic conductivity (electrolyte must be a 

good ion conductor and ideally an electron insulator); (ii) dense structure (electrolyte must be 

gas tight); (iii) stability (the electrolyte when exposed to both air and fuel, at elevated 

temperatures, must be chemically stable); and (iv) well-matched thermal expansion coefficient 

(in a composite material structure, the thermal expansion coefficient must match at the 

electrolyte/electrode interface to prevent cracking of the joint on thermal changes). 

Often used electrolytes materials for SOFCs are nonstoichiometric (i.e., oxygen-

deficient) oxides
[ 18]

 with low valent element (cations) substitutions, the latter also referred to as 

acceptor dopants, which create oxygen vacancies (disorder sites) through charge 

compensation. Historically, SOFCs have been based on electrolytes of zirconia (    ) doped 

with the addition of a small percentage of yttria (    ). Above the temperature of about 600°C, 

zirconia becomes a conductor of oxygen ions (   ), and typically the zirconia-based SOFC 

operates between 800 °C and 1000 °C. Yttrium-stabilized-     or     (e.g.,          1  1    or, 

equivalently,    ) is the most common electrolyte that satisfies the material requirements just 

described, however there is a wealth of other possibilities, such as acceptor doped      and 

perovskite structure oxides
[ 8]

.  

Typically, the amount of doping with yttria is of the order of 13-16% by weight (8-10% 

mol) to give fully stabilized cubic material
[ 7]

. The ability to conduct     ions is brought about by 

the fluorite cubic crystal structure of zirconia in which some of the      ions are replaced with 

    ions (when this ion exchange occurs, a number of oxide-ion sites become vacant
[ 7,8]

).  

The ionic conductivity of     (          1 at 800°C;          1 at 1000 °C) is comparable with 

that of liquid electrolytes. Although     shows the lowest ionic conductivity (see Fig. 1.11), it 

remains as one of the few materials that has been demonstrated to provide long-term stability 



Chapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 16 
 

under real operation conditions
[ 8]

. Different approaches have been attempted in order to apply 

    in the intermediate-temperature operation. The typical one is to decrease the thickness of 

    electrolyte and thus minimize the overall ohmic loss.  Other approaches include the 

development of new doped zirconia oxides; however, some of these new materials (e.g., 

Scandia-doped     ) often show higher costs and aging issues, making them unsuited (at 

least at the present time) for commercial application
 [ 14]

Composition and microstructure features are critical aspects of anode performance and 

they should enable the SOFC to meet the following requirements
[ 13, 8]

: (i) an excellent catalyst 

for the electrochemical oxidation of the fuel; (ii) stable in reducing atmosphere; (iii) good 

electron conductor; and (iv) have sufficient porosity (20–40%) to allow transport of gas species 

in (reactants) and out (products) of the TPBs, where the fuel reaction takes place.  

The anode is usually a     cermet
9
 in which the metallic component is nickel, thus 

forming a porous   -    cermet (see Fig. 1.12a).  This   -    cermet is typically a complex 

composite-system made of intertwined conductive networks (ionically conducting solid-phase, 

electronically conducting solid-phase; and gas flow in porous-phase), all of which should 

ultimately participate in the formation of percolating networks of TPBs (see Fig. 1.12b).  The 

    serves to: (i) inhibit sintering of the    particles; (ii) provide thermal expansion coefficient 

comparable to that of the electrolyte; (iii) allow better adhesion of the anode with the

electrolyte; and to facilitate the transport of oxygen ions. Nickel is chosen precisely because of 

its high electronic conductivity and stability under chemically reducing conditions. In a   -    

anode, nickel also has the role of being an electrocatalyst for hydrogen oxidation and a current 

collector
[ 13]

. It is also a highly active catalyst for the steam reforming reaction of methane
[ 19]

, 

thus the presence of nickel can be used to advantage as a reforming catalyst, making it 

possible to carry out internal reforming in the SOFC directly (see §§1.3.4.5).

Unluckily, however,    may also catalyze the formation of filamentous carbon from 

gaseous hydrocarbons under reducing conditions
[ 19]

. In this case, the anode activity will surely 

suffer due to formation of the carbon-containing deposits (see §§1.3.4.5). Incorporating oxide-

based catalysts (e.g.,        ) is an interesting approach
[ 20]

 that has been tried to overcome 

this limitation of   -based anodes and allow direct utilization of hydrocarbon fuels.

Composition and microstructure features are also critical aspects of cathode 

performance and they should enable the SOFC to meet the following requirements
[ 13]

: (i) 

excellent catalyst for the dissociation of oxygen molecule and oxygen reduction; (ii) stable in 

oxidizing atmosphere; (iii) good electron conductor; (iv) sufficient porosity (20–40%) to allow 

transport of gas species in (reactants) and out (products) of the TPB, where the oxygen 

reaction takes place; (v) the thermal expansion should match with other cell components; and 

(iv) it should have chemical compatibility and minimum reactivity with the electrolyte with which 

it comes into contact. Most cathodes are now made from either electronically conducting 

composite oxides or mixed electron-conducting-ion-conducting (MIEC) ceramics. 

The most common cathode material is the strontium-doped lanthanum manganite, e.g. 

(             )         (   ), which is often used in composite designs, such as in mixtures of 

YSZ and     (see Fig. 1.9). Mixed conducting perovskites, such as (          )                 

(    ), have been also used as cathode materials. These mixed conducting perovskites, 

especially the p-type conducting perovskite structures, are particularly attractive because they 

exhibit mixed ionic and electronic conductivity (see Fig. 1.13). In general, when compared with 

   , these materials offer
[ 13]

 higher bulk oxide-ion diffusion rates and exhibit faster oxygen 

reduction kinetics (including faster surface exchange). The latter aspect is important, 

considering that the oxygen reduction reaction can constitute a major performance hurdler to 

the electrochemical performance of SOFCs. The application of multi-layered (functionally 

graded) cathodes has also been shown to decrease activation losses
[ 8]

, especially when 

adjusting optimum values for both the grain diameter and porosity of cathode at the outer 

(close to air channel) and inner (close to electrolyte) layers.

Fuel processing may be defined as the conversion of the raw primary fuel, as delivered 

to a SOFC system, into the fuel gas that is actually required by the stack (anodes). At least 

from the point of view of technology feasibility, SOFCs can utilize a wide range of hydrocarbon 

fuels, provided that these are properly cleaned and reformed into “simpler” fuels such as H2 

and CO
[ 4]

. Therefore, the main purpose of fuel processing is to convert readily available 

hydrocarbon fuels into H2-rich and/or CO-rich gas (both gases are at times referred to as 

reformate streams) that can be electrochemically oxidized at the fuel cell anode. The fastest 

electrochemical reaction at the nickel anode is that of hydrogen gas, but other fuels can reac t 

directly with the anode, depending on catalyst composition
[ 21]

. For example, carbon monoxide 

can also react on        but it requires a higher overvoltage than hydrogen
[ 22]

, meaning that 

   electrochemical oxidation rate is relatively slower when compared to that of   .  

The fuel may also require some level of purification because fuel impurities (e.g., sulfur) 

are a common source of damaging mechanism, which ultimately might lead to the total failure 

of a SOFC
[ 4]

. Sulfur is the most prevalent impurity and can be present in most fuels derived 

from fossil sources, either by nature or added as odorant. Even lower levels of sulfur (in the 

order of     ), such as those found in odorants used in natural gas for leak detection), are 

damaging to SOFC nickel anodes
[ 4]

 given that sulfur and sulfur-compounds are known to 

adsorb and cause a loss in the electrode performance
[ 23]

. There are two approaches to tackle 

this problem: adding a sulfur absorber to the fuel processing unit (see Fig. 1.14); and/or using 

anode metals that are less likely to be negatively affected by sulfur.

Chapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 20 
 

The requirements and complexity of the fuel processing step depends largely on both 

fuel cell type and raw fuel. The nickel content in the anode of SOFCs means that internal 

reforming reactions can be carried out directly (internally) in porous anodes, and this is to a 

great advantage in minimizing the overall system complexity and total costs
[ 4]

. The high 

operation temperature not only provides waste heat exhaust, but it also effectively activates 

the processes of reforming in the presence of suitable catalysts (such as nickel-based 

materials). The electrochemical oxidation of fuels gives off excess heat that can be utilized by 

the highly endothermic steam and/or dry reforming reactions simultaneously taking place, 

which makes internal on-cell reformation possible, precluding the need for external reformer 

and allowing chemical integration with the main products (e.g.,    /   ) originated from 

electrochemical reactions. This possibility has led to various internal reforming concepts on the 

account of SOFC high operating temperatur. In one of these concepts, fuel reforming occurs 

when steam is added to hydrocarbon fuel stream (typically at a ratio of 3 parts steam to 1 part 

fuel) in SOFCs with the so-called direct internal reforming or DIR design
[ 4, 13]

; or, alternatively, 

when using virtually dry fuels (without the need of adding steam to the inlet fuel stream) in 

SOFCs that operate with gradual catalytic reforming
[ 24]

.  

Unfortunately, however, the main advantages of DIR-SOFCs can be completely offset 

by the occurrence of “anode coking” (i.e., carbon deposition), which can render the SOFC 

permanently non-functional after short time of operation
[ 25]

. Thus, a major roadblock to long-

term stability of DIR-SOFCs operating on methane and otherhydrocarbon fuels is the anodic 

carbon deposition. Nickel-based anodes have the propensity to coke
[ 8]

, that is, to become 

coated (and blocked) with a carbon layer on reacting with dry fuels such as pure methane. 

From this point of view, nickel-based catalysts may not be a suitable choice for DIR 

applications, if care is not taken to ensure a proper fuel/steam ratio before the fuel mixture 

reaches the anode active layer. There is, however, an alternative cell design that tries to tackle 

some of the stability limitations that are typical of standard   -cermets. In contrast to traditional 

SOFC designs, in which   -based anodes acts as the only effective catalyst for internal 

reforming, this alternative design suggests the use of a barrier-layer architecture. In other 

words, “a barrier” is done by the addition of either a thin catalyst layer
[ 24, 26, 27]

 or thick inert 

layer
[ 28]

 between the anode and fuel channel (see Fig. 1.15).  

Both chemically inert and catalytic anode barrier layers are found to offer advantages 

when compared to conventional techniques, because they permit a more complete reforming 

and deposit-free operation (i.e., they process the fuel and protect the anode) by enhancing 

stability and locally slowing catalytic endothermic reforming reactions. In terms of stability, the 

barrier hinders the flux of fuel into the electro-catalytically active region and likewise hinders 



Chapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 21 
 

the flux of    /    from the anode to fuel channel. Accordingly, the gas-phase composition in 

contact with    can be maintained in a coke-free thermodynamic region

.

The sections that follow are intended to provide a summary of the main topics to be 

addressed in this work. Although this summary was not elaborated in a systematic way, it is 

expected nonetheless that the given information should facilitate the future comprehension of 

these topics and how they interrelate to one another (see Fig. 1.16) in the next chapters.

Although much of the modeling approaches that will be discussed in this work could be 

used with different SOFC configurations, the focus herein is on one specific design: button -

type SOFC
[ 29, 30]

 with a normally impinging circular jet flow configuration in both air-side and 

fuel-side compartments (gas channels), as illustrated on figures 1.17 and 1.18. Single button-

cells play a major role in the development and evaluation of new SOFC materials and PEN 

architectures
[ 13]

. These single-cell tests are useful to determine the cell performance under 

ideal conditions, where gold or platinum are often used to make excellent current contact with 

the electrodes (though there still are contact issues that might severely bias the experimental 

readout
[ 29]

). The primary purpose of button-cell testing is to provide a method of assessing the 

effects of changes in cell design, component materials, and fabrication processes.  

While it is always desirable to obtain accurate results, the usual outcome of screening 

tests using button cells is comparative in nature.  In other words, many experimenters use 

button cell testing as a relative rather than absolute test method. By defining a reference 

polarization curve or impedance spectrum for well-defined materials and operating conditions, 

the changes relative to the reference condition are determined and interpreted
[ 30]

.  However, 

despite this seemingly simple comparison methodology, it is important to recognize that 

broader implications can be inferred from button-cell results
[ 13, 29]

. According to Fig. 1.17, most 

button-cell tests are performed in temperature-controlled furnaces, where the 

anode/electrolyte/cathode (PEN) is held concentrically between other tubes, which are made 

of either glass or ceramic materials. 

Typically, PENs are small circular cells of one to five centimeters in diameter that are 

bounded to tubular fixtures. All these tubes must be sealed hermetically against the PEN disc 

before the assembly is positioned within the furnace. Reducing and oxidizing gases are 

supplied to either side (anode and cathode sides, respectively) of the PEN via much thinner 

inner feeding tubes
10

. For example, in Fig. 1.17b a fuel mixture flows from top to bottom in the 

fuel channel at the top, and is transported into the pores of the anode-barrier. In the buffer-

layer and anode the fuel mixture undergo chemical reaction on catalyst surfaces and one or 

more species, which can be either initially present or produced in situ, may then be 

electrochemically oxidized on reaching the anode active layer near the dense electrolyte. For 

each experimental run, the porosity, particle sizes, pore sizes, and the chemical composition of 

electrode layers may, in principle, all vary along the cell thickness in order to acquire different 

types of experimental information.

 In button-cell experiments, the cathode side is usually exposed to air that may simply be the furnace air or it 
may be supplied via a feed tube. The latter case is shown on figures 1.17 and 1.18.

Button-cells inherit their main characteristics from a wider group of flow reactors, the 

so-called stagnation flow reactors (SFRs). Stagnation flows represent a very important class of 

flow configurations
[ 33]

 wherein the transport equations often reduce to a system of ordinary 

differential equations (ODEs) describing boundary-value problems. Some of these flows have 

great practical value in industrial applications, such as in chemical-vapor-deposition (CVD) 

reactors
[ 33]

. They are also widely used in catalytic combustion research
[ 34]

.  

Stagnation flows may be seen as a particular case of normally impinging circular jets in 

confined spaces and, depending on the problem’s geometrical dimensions and fluid flow 

parameters, different flow similarity reductions (either complete or incomplete) are possible
[ 35, 

36]
. A peculiar feature of SFRs is that the phenomena under study usually take place within a 

thin viscous region adjacent to a solid surface, which usually plays a catalytic role. Thus, SFRs 

are often employed to study heterogeneous catalysis problems under “ideal conditions”. The 

idealization aspect of SFRs refers to the condition that the processes occurring at the solid 

surface should not be influenced (limited) by upstream conditions (the outer flow region). More 

generally, in SFRs the result of the interaction between the outer flow region and boundary-

layer is assumed to be well known (“controlled and resolved”), thus any effects stemming from 

this interaction might be seamlessly separated from, for example, the intrinsic reactivity of 

surface catalysis (see §§4.10). 

There is a large body of experimental data on SOFC button-cell experiments running on 

fuels such as   ,    ,       , and higher HCs. However, although the existing setups for 

button-cell testing share many common characteristics, different research groups follow 

different practices in testing cells and reporting experimental data. At the moment of this

writing, there are still no strictly standardized single-cell testing procedures providing 

forethought and criteria for conducting such tests, though there were attempts in this direction
[ 

37]
. The careful consideration of what is necessary to successfully test button-cells can often 

bring increased awareness about otherwise “inexplicable” experimental results. Moreover, 

many underpinning mathematical models that depict the behavior of PEN architectures are 

usually developed and validated with button-cell experiments. It is therefore of paramount 

importance to understand, in an unambiguous manner, the influence of experimental setup 

and operating conditions on measured cell performance. Numerical investigation of cell 

performance should ensure the use of physically consistent model parameters to explain the 

experimental outcome. 

As mentioned above, button-cell testing permits comparative appraisal based on 

changes of design, materials, and operating conditions. In this regard, there is a certain degree 

of “flexibility” only insofar as the model parameters can be adjusted to fit experimental data. 

However, this flexibility can be elusive, especially if contentious conclusions arise from the 

comparison between model predictions and experimental results. Such situation can indeed 

occur if, for instance: 

? If a given mathematical model (and its underlying assumptions) is unfit for the 

purpose of credibly describing the physical reality of the experiment. In this case, 

it is not uncommon the use of inconsistent parameters solely for the intent of “best 

fitting” the experimental dataset, and as a way to compensate for other sources of 

error (i.e., as in a false correction), thus disregarding the physical pertinence of 

the model itself. 
 

? The test itself was not well thought out, meaning that “meaningless” results can 

follow from either improper testing procedures or wrong assumptions about the 

actual experimental conditions. Sometimes there is a nuance on how to 

differentiate between these factors. 

 
Due to either of the causes just mentioned above, conclusions tend to lessen in 

practical value and, ultimately, the objective comparison between model and experiment is 

impaired. An examination concerning these aspects must be performed, including the scrutiny 

of different reactor models (e.g., plug-flow, finite-gap stagnation flow, and flow between parallel 

discs) and the evaluation of possible sources of experimental bias, such as seal leakage 

during cell tests. It is important to mention that part of the works in the literature that will be 

reviewed in Chapter 4 has employed different experimental setups for the gas channel (planar 

cells with parallel flow, for example). In spite of that, the remarks made above about button-cell 

testing remain valid in respect to the importance of understanding the influence of 

experimental setup on the de facto measured cell performance.  



Chapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 26 
 

 

Dominant forces that influence micro-scale components, such as the PEN in SOFC 

systems, are peculiarly different from those that influence their conventional-scale 

(macroscopic) counterparts. This is because the size of a physical system bears a significant 

influence on the natural processes that dictate the behavior of that system, i.e. variance in 

scale might lead to sensible differences in transport mechanisms. For example, large-scale 

systems are influenced by inertial effects to a greater extent than small-scale systems, while 

the latter is influenced greatly by surface effects. In many scientific disciplines, this concept of 

interrelating scales and physical phenomena is commonly called “physics of scaling laws” 
[ 38]

.  

During the development stage of a mathematical model, an approach is usually 

specialized toward particular phenomenon and scale. This screening strategy is largely due to 

the need to rationalize the overall goal of modeling activities, when computational cost and 

theoretical uncertainness must be both quantified and balanced (via trade-offs) in order to 

accurately and feasibly describe the critical processes responsible for SOFC performance. 

Nonetheless, the simulation of SOFC systems is a problem that incorporates important 

features from multiple physical scales
[ 2]

. Therefore, in principle, a number of different and 

simultaneous physicochemical processes (“multiphysics’”) that take place over a wide range of 

spatio-temporal scales (“multiscale”) have to be acknowledged. When a detailed 

understanding of the relevant processes at a given scale is required, one should refer to more 

specialized models that treat the details of single parts of the SOFC (e.g., models specifically 

developed and validated for the “PEN or single-cell scale”). Even so, electrode-level 

phenomena still entail a considerable challenge for traditional (“single-scale” or monoscale) 

modeling approaches, because transport and thermodynamic processes occurring in the PEN 

are also strongly, and often nonlinearly, coupled over various length and time scales
[ 3]

. 

Furthermore, this coupling effect can manifest itself as a dominant influence of the microscale 

physical-chemistry over the macroscopic behavior of SOFC and, in this case, such intimate 

degree of interdependence should not be undervalued. 

To cope with the multiscale character of the problem at hand, the existing SOFC 

modeling techniques (see Fig. 1.19) range from atomistic to system-scale applications
[ 1, 2]

, 

likewise multiscale model methods
[ 39]

 range from quantum to classical  (field)  mechanical 

theories . For the most part, multiscale modeling intend to predict material properties and/or 

system behavior on one scale using information, e.g. models and/or experimental data, from 

different scales
[ 40]

, a concept which is usually referred to as “scale linking” or “scale bridging”. 

According to Fig. 1.19, on each distinct scale, a specific modeling technique can be used to 



Chapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 27 
 

describe the system, as for instance: (i) scale of quantum mechanical models (information 

about electrons is included); (ii) scale of molecular dynamics models (information about 

individual atoms and/or molecules is included); (iii) mesoscale (information about groups of 

atoms and/or molecules is included); (iv) and the scale of continuum models
12

, also known as 

macroscopic, coarse-grained or conventional-scale models (device-level or system-level 

information is included).

: illustrative scheme of time and length scales 
involved in modeling SOFCs (figure modified from [ 2]). 

 

The use or not-use of multiscale modeling methods depends heavily on whether and 

how they can be applied in practice and also what the expected benefits are in comparison to 

other modeling approaches. Briefly, one may distinguish two main cases:  

i. The phenomenon of interest is dominated by processes occurring on different 

characteristic scales. That is, the phenomenon presents substantial spatial and 

time heterogeneity on these scales and, therefore, such heterogeneities must be 

evaluated by theoretical (“more detailed”) models in order to produce useful 

simulation results. In this case, therefore, multi-scale resolution is an intrinsic 

requirement to assess the SOFC performance.[ 41, 42, 43] 
 

                                                      
12

 Here one must bear in mind the distinction between definitions of continuum from mathematics ( e.g., continuum 
hypothesis, linear continuum, continuum theory of topology) and that from continuum mechanics

[ 41]
.

 Strictly speaking, neither the FVM nor FME is tied to any specific scale restriction, when they are viewed as 
purely discretization schemes. Thus, these methods are not necessarily applied only to macroscale -continuum 
formulations of governing equations. For instance, the FVM has been used

[ 42, 43]
 as the method for solving the 

discrete formulation of Lattice-Boltzmann Equation (LBE). However, the application of the traditional forms of FVM 
and FEM in complex geometries might be not suitable for multiphysics numerical simulations, such as in those 
geometries resulting from the detailed (“structure-resolved”) description of porous media on the nanoscopic or 
mesoscopic length scale.

ii. The interest consists in predicting material properties or system behavior based 

on the knowledge of more elementary processes and/or fundamental properties, 

even though physical scaling effects do not need to be accounted for explicitly to 

produce useful results on the scale of interest. For example: one wishes to 

investigate what is the influence of the grain size distribution (i.e., a subscale 

influence) of an ionic phase on the effective conductivity of a given electrode 

material. However, all that would be required to calculate this effective value on 

the macroscale is the phase’s temperature, through the use of a suitable single-

scale (lumped parameter) model. Thus, in this case, subscale resolution is not 

mandatory to assess SOFC macroscale performance. No doubt this is simply a 

matter of research convenience. 

 
In both cases above, accounting for the interactions from multiple levels turns to be a 

critical ability in understanding the phenomenology that one is particularly interested on and 

which is observed from some deliberately chosen scale. It should be manifest, however, that 

there is an inherent level of subjectivity when deciding whether to use high-fidelity microscopic 

models or to apply coarse-graining of those models
[ 40]

. Depending on the overall goal of the 

numerical simulation, in some situations one can apply “one-dimensional” or even “zero-

dimensional” models to complex problems and still succeed in their application, provided that 

enough lumped parameters are available “to fit” the experimental behavior. It must be equally 

evident that in this situation there is loss of information, lack of generality, and also possible 

physical inconsistencies at the expense of simulation pragmatism. On the other hand, the 

coarse-graining can deprive the model of its complex scale-to-scale interaction on which the 

main physical-chemical behavior depends for a proper description.  In this case, the accuracy 

of lower-dimensional calculation models can become a fallacy. Moreover, these models often 

become strongly dependent on rather “random best fitting” and “best guess” averaging 

procedures, with resulting parameters that are disproved of physical consistency.   

Much depends on the purpose of the simulation and what type of problem is being 

tackled. For example, the dynamic and predictive control modeling of SOFCs on a system-

level
[ 44]

 is computationally prohibitive, if detailed descriptions of all parts of the fuel cell are to 

be included. Thus, rationalization of computational effort and accuracy requirements form the 

basis of the modeling strategy. The decision-making often involves the selection of a “fit for 

purpose” modeling technique: a model should be reasonably accurate and detailed enough to 

capture characteristics that are deemed important to the numerical study; on the other hand, 

the selected model should, ideally, require a much lower computational effort than that 

required by atomistic-level models.   



Chapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 29 
 

Once the superstructure of the modeling approach (i.e., its governing equations) has 

been established, a critical step is to define reliable and accurate constitutive equations (i.e., 

closure relations) for the materials involved (e.g., gas species and porous solids). These 

relations are usually expressed in terms of the various parameters appearing in governing 

equations (“balance laws”) and their evaluation can be performed through theoretical 

constitutive equations of material models, using experimentally fitted values, or both. The type 

and number of constitutive terms that will require prescription depends solely upon what 

modeling approach has been selected. Thus, here one faces a subtle "back and forth trade -

off", but an important one. 

If one selects a model for which a “mathematical closure” relation is necessary, such 

relation must be somehow known upfront to guarantee self-consistency of the chosen 

modeling technique. Moreover, if this specific closure greatly affects the results as predicted by 

the model, then it is of utmost importance to have a closure relation that can be reliably and 

accurately evaluated. If this is not possible, one should strive to identify another (more) 

appropriate modeling superstructure. Thus, ascertaining whether a property can or cannot be 

evaluated interferes in the screening process of modeling techniques. More often than not, the 

more detailed the model the greater the number of properties that will need proper 

mathematical description. In general, the extent of ones knowledge about the properties of a 

system restrains the amount of details that is possible to accrue from numerical simulations. 

Transport and thermodynamic properties are a necessary part of physical models, 

inasmuch as characterizing the molecular transport in multicomponent-multiphase mixtures 

requires, for example, the evaluation of viscosities and diffusion coefficients. The 

characterization of molecular transport should be underlined by the discussion about the 

thermodynamic formalism (i.e., constitutive relations) that actually supports the evaluation of 

those material-related proprieties. That is, there should be some analysis on the adopted 

macroscale mixture theory and whether or not heterogeneous systems
[ 45]

 have been properly 

considered in this theory. However, these formalisms are often tacitly and uncritically adopted 

in the SOFC literature. This is an important topic, because a given thermodynamic theory 

might not be consistent in the wide sense of a microscopic theory of processes that occur in 

systems that are not in statistical equilibrium. In these situations, kinetic properties are more 

closely related to the nature of microscopic interactions of a particular phenomenon
[ 46]

 than to 

that of the “averaged” macroscopic behavior. Nevertheless, considering what has been argued 

in §§1.1, this type of discussion (“analysis of general thermodynamic formalisms”) is beyond 

the scope of this work. 



Chapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 30 
 

Finally, it is worth to mention that in the case of closure relations that are based on 

experimentally measured information, property data furnished by “conventional” (macroscale) 

methods are integral values over some a priori characteristic time and length scales (inherent 

to the experimental technique used). That is, the available data already represent averaged 

values in some sense. This fact may or may not limit the usage of this experimental 

information in fine-scale models whose aim is to solve problems over significantly distinct time 

and length scales. In other words, there may be an intractable ”lumping effect” that can render 

the simulation results unreliable, if the intrinsic averaging of fine-scale models (when these are 

integrated over the computational domain) does not lead to the same natural average of the 

experimental test from which property data was obtained. 

 

 

Although this work addresses a specific problem (e.g., gas transport in SOFCs), its 

theme belongs to a wide field of research, which is the modeling of transport processes in 

porous medium systems
[ 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54]

. In this field, certain subject areas play a major 

role, namely: (i) factors related to material (structure and properties) characterization of porous 

domains; (ii) dynamics of fluids in the percolated voids of porous spaces, including 

multicomponent physical kinetics and thermodynamics aspects; and (iii) the heterogeneous 

(metal-catalyzed) chemical-electrochemical reactions on pore-wall surface. The modeling of 

transport processes within porous catalysts entails a multitude of problems, the majority of 

them of severe complexity and still under intense debate in the literature
[ 55, 56]

. Most notably, 

the theoretical limitations of the phenomenological modeling techniques commonly applied to 

describe the intrinsic multiscale nature of surface-catalyzed phenomena
[ 55, 57]

.  

To some extent, the turmoil and uncertainty found in the literature, concerning both the 

experimental and theoretical aspects of transport phenomena in porous media, make 

impossible to extract a theory of the comprehensiveness that is desired. Moreover, it is oft en 

arduous to disentangle hard distinctions from elusive research findings, where the latter might 

be merely an accurate measure of a prevailing bias
[ 58]

. In the specific case of this work, 

however, this is not a complete fair depiction of the state of affairs as this is not what 

essentially prevents one from obtaining a consistent mathematical framework. What one 

should consider of great difficult is not the lack of satisfactory theories, but rather the 

widespread ambiguities, misunderstandings, and confusion stemming from the derivation and 

application of some of the existing (and not usually regarded as well-established) transport 

phenomena models. Confidence in the use of these models is probably undermined primarily 

when: (i) their physical assumptions are not properly acknowledged; (ii) their results are 



Chapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 31 
 

claimed more certain than they really are; and (iii) when they are assumed to have far-reaching 

applicability, when forcibly they have not. It is necessary therefore to recognize that the model 

should be verified considering its real context of application. For example, the underlying 

theory for evaluating the problem of multicomponent diffusion in the free (unconstrained or 

“bulk”) gas volume can be dramatically different when wall effects are (or should be) taken 

under consideration, as it is the case for diffusional transport in tight porous media. Similar 

statements can be drawn on the basis of the influences from chemical reactions, 

adsorption/desorption, viscous shear, and gas rarefaction on diffusion mechanisms. To rightly 

solve the problem of multicomponent transport, a consistent and all-encompassing (extended) 

thermodynamic basis is needful to derive phenomenological equations that are able to capture 

the complexities of multicomponent transport
[ 59, 60, 61]

. 

There is a long-time state of confusion in the area of multicomponent transport in 

capillaries and pores, when marcoscale phenomenological frameworks are applied. Many 

models and theories have been devised based on a large number of simple approximations, 

such as the “Bosanquet formula”
[ 62]

, for which it was stated that the linear momentum 

conservation was, allegedly, the basis for the derivations. However, nowhere the fluid shear 

appeared. Present mass transport theories often used by chemical engineers, stemming from 

the statistical-mechanics developments of Chapman–Enskog, Zhdanov–Kagan–Sazykin, and 

Bearman–Kirkwood apply only to systems with low shear (e.g., see §§3.6). These theories are 

not able to satisfactorily describe gaseous counter-diffusion in small pores as well. The linear 

irreversible thermodynamics theory by de Groot–Mazur and Hirschfelder–Curtiss–Bird also 

demonstrates several shortcomings. Some authors also developed models based on forceful 

erroneous steps in an attempt to repair the faults of their starting equation, e.g., as it is the 

case of the well-known Dusty Gas Model
[ 63, 50]

.  

It is clear, therefore, that a rigorous understanding of the complete set of wall-

constrained governing equations of gas transport would be crucial to analyze the problems 

addressed in this dissertation. For instance, it seems of utmost importance the need for a 

better and more clearly identifiable justification for the origin of the pressure gradient terms in 

the macroscale Maxwell-Stefan formalism
[ 64, 65]

. To fail in doing so can lead to “unnoticed 

consequences” that are as formidable as the lack of mass conservation, as it is, in fact, the 

case of some models found in the SOFC literature
[ 66]

. Unfortunately, there is a prevailing trend 

in the development of purely macroscopic phenomenologies that considers that mathematical 

formalisms, which are needed to describe the mixed-gas transport behavior, are much the 

same for all types of porous media. Such generalization cannot hold on well-founded 

physicochemical principles, especially due to the interplay of both multiscale and multiphysics 



Chapter 1 ? General Introduction and Background 32 
 

occurring in these systems. Inherent limitations of the linear non-equilibrium thermodynamics, 

on which many phenomenological frameworks are based, have greatly contributed to such 

misconceptions. The apparent absence of due criticism of such models in the literature seems 

to amount to acceptance but the relevant microscopic characteristics of interrelated transport 

phenomena (e.g., mass transfer, wall effects, chemical reactions) can surely impact the 

veracity of these models at the macroscopic continuum.  

An analysis of mass transport should be performed to rule out inconsistencies or, which 

is the same, to establish a well-defined mathematical description of the transport phenomena 

that could significantly affect critical physicochemical processes. Mass transport constitutes 

one of the “building blocks” (see Fig. 1.16) that needs to be analyzed in its particularities and 

then, subsequently, in its interactions with other scientific disciplines (see Fig. 1.20 and Fig. 

1.21). It seems reasonably logical that specific inaccuracies from one block can propagate to 

the others and, depending on the number and relative influence of such “inconsistencies”, the 

resulting variants of “error of judgment” can become baffling. In other words, the fact that many 

sources of error can have the same “intractable weight” can render the overall analysis 

incredible. Thus, when trying to make a sizeable evaluation of potential inconsistencies one 

expects to lend credence to conclusions of this work and make them theoretically tractable.  

Although the focus of this work is to describe transport processes taking place in the 

gas-phase (“multicomponent gas flow in SOFC porous layers”), it would be impossible to have 

a well-posed physical problem without also examining, to some extent, aspects related to 

electrochemical reactions and charge transport. Even so, “for the sake of feasibility” and not to 

overwhelm this work with endless accounts of sub models, these other aspects will be treated 

as “black-boxes” as much as possible. The specific mathematical form accounting the 

interactions between gas-phase transport and electrochemical reactions (interfacial 

phenomena) depends on the coarse-graining of the models considered. Regardless of the 

scale of description, interfacial phenomena always will be represented in some form of 

mathematical abstraction (local microscale balances, boundary conditions, “pseudo-

heterogeneous” volumetric source terms, and so forth). These interface entities, whichever 

their explicit from are, will always have relevant impact on the modeling of gas-phase 

transport. However, no in-depth analysis will be made about them in this work, which would 

include the known limitations of the mean-field approximation when it is used to describe 

nanoscale-driven heterogeneous catalysis.

Even though the electrochemistry is the “heart and soul” of any fuel cell device
[ 67, 68]

, it 

was intentionally decided to not pursue a thorough review of electrochemical modeling in this 

work, and thus avoiding any rigorous or extended presentation about the fundamental 

concepts of electrochemical engineering. The reason being that such task would require 

tremendous effort and thus consume much time that could be otherwise spent on the 

cornerstone issues that this dissertation really aims to address, namely: mass and momentum 

transport modeling in the gas-phase.  To clarify further about this scope delimitation, here 

follows a brief reasoning. 

A number of electrochemical processes (e.g., charge transport, electrochemical 

kinetics, and thermal effects in non-isothermal systems) has an additional “encumbrance” 

when they are compared to other research topics considered in this work. Several fundamental 

aspects of SOFC operation still involve not very well understood physicochemical phenomena, 

thus many questions remain on the exact electrochemistry theory that could describe such 

aspects. In other words, there is no unarguable consensus on the mechanisms and 

phenomenology underlying the design of these electrochemical systems. For instance, charge 

transfer kinetics remains as one of the least understood aspects of the electrochemistry
[ 69, 67, 

13, 70, 71, 72]
 of solid state devices. In this way, the attempt of pursuing fully credible SOFC 

models at various levels of detail, from continuum-level electrochemistry approach (aimed at 

macroscopic simulations) to “microscale” studies using structured-resolved/molecular-level 

approaches, seems unpractical at the present time. Therefore, considering the scope 

limitations of the present work and the available research knowledge, the author opted to 

dedicate efforts to some key aspects of SOFC modeling, which are, on some level, related to 

concentration polarization processes. 



1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1 1, 12, 13, 14, 15, 1 6, 17, 18 , 19, 20, 2 1, 22, 23 , 24, 25, 2 6, 27, 2 8, 29, 30, 31, 32, 3 3, 34, 35 , 36, 37, 3 8, 39, 40 ,  41, 42, 4 3, 44, 45, 46, 47, 4 8, 49, 50 , 51, 52, 5 3, 54, 5 5, 56,  57, 5 8, 59, 60 , 61, 62, 6 3, 64, 6 5, 66, 67, 68, 69, 7 0, 71, 72  

 

At this point it is worth to clarify the reasons for including a small and yet relevant 

excerpt related to the “black-box” thermodynamics of a fuel cell (see Fig. 1.2a). As will be 

made clear latter on, many of the mathematical models used to evaluate the so-called 

“concentration-induced losses” are based on thermostatics considerations. Even though these 

models may take a further Gibbsian approach (i.e., in the sense that there is a more detailed 

physicochemical look inside the “black-box” thermodynamic system), it should remain apparent 

that there is an underlying classical (global) equilibrium thermodynamics framework linking 

some of the terms/relations that appear in such simplified models. In other words, one must 

emphasize that the derivation of these terms/relations implies, at least at their natural origin, a 

global state of exact balance for the potentials, or driving forces, within the macroscopic 

system. Thus, any “extrapolation” of such terms/relations, when used “unnaturally” in a local 

form of balance laws (now tacitly considering the state of the system to be non-uniform-locally-

varying in presence of dissipative thermodynamic fluxes), must be duly scrutinized at the 

pertinent time.  

The following discussions are restricted to electrodes in equilibrium with both the 

electrolyte phase and adjacent gas phase. In this phase equilibria, the cell potential can be 

expressed in terms of the electrochemical potential of chemical species present on the 

electrode surface and also in the gas that fills the voids of porous structures
[ 67]

. The condition 

of phase equilibrium precludes the passage of anything but an infinitesimal electric current. 

Moreover, it is tacitly assumed the inexistence of other spontaneous chemical reactions that do 

not require a net current to occur. Equilibrium does also imply macroscopic homogeneity in a 

given phase, in the sense that local migrational equilibrium
[ 73]

 does not take place anywhere 

within that phase.

The Gibbs energy is a relevant quantity in the case of fuel cells (or any electrochemical 

device for that matter), for which it may be defined as the “energy available to do useful 

external work, but neglecting any work done by changes in pressure or volume”
[ 4]

. In this case, 

the “useful work” involves moving electrons round an external circuit and any work done by 

change in volume/pressure between the input and output is not harnessed by the fuel cell 

itself. In other words, Gibbs energy is a quantity that can be directly associated with the 

electrochemical energy conversion in a SOFC. Thus, considering both reactants and products 

under the same constant   and  , one can express reaction (2.1)  as: 

                    |     (  |   
 

 
   |  ) (2.2) 

 

In general, the Gibbs energy of formation is a function of temperate and state (liquid or 

gas), and, in the specific case of a fuel cell, its value is negative (     ), meaning that 

energy is released in the transformation given by reaction (2.1). If there are “no additional 

losses” in the fuel cell (i.e., the process is reversible and the entropy change is only due to a 

reversible chemical reaction to create new water molecules), then all the Gibbs energy can be 

converted into electrical energy. 

The basic operation of a SOFC was depicted in Chapter 1, wherein it was shown that, 

for a pure hydrogen-fueled cell, two electrons pass round the external circuit for each water 

molecule produced and for each molecule of hydrogen consumed. Thus, for one mole of 

hydrogen used, 2   electrons pass round the external circuit. If  
  is the charge on one 

electron, then the total charge flow is: 

      
      [        ] (2.3) 

 

Where   is the Faraday constant (                ).  If   is the fuel cell voltage, then the 

reversible electrical work done moving this charge round the circuit is 

                     ?(        )           [      ] (2.4) 

 

Where    is the charge being moved (and on which coulombic forces act);   is the charge 

displacement;   is the electrostatic potential (voltage) field calculated at some at some point  ; 

If the process is reversible, this electrical work will be equal to the Gibbs energy released    . 

Thus

 (2.5) 

This equation gives the electromotive force (EMF) or reversible voltage (    ) of a 

hydrogen SOFC. This is the voltage drop between the anode and the cathode under open-

circuit conditions (i.e., under zero net current condition), with the electrochemical potential of 

oxide ions equilibrated through the oxide-ion conducting electrolyte layer. Equation (2.5), 

derived for the reversible open-circuit voltage (OCV) of a hydrogen/oxygen SOFC, can be 

applied to other reactions, by generalizing it to any number    of electrons per mole of fuel, 

     
    

    
 (2.6) 

 

 

The way to define the efficiency of fuel cell devices is not unique. Thus, statements 

such as “the maximum possible efficiency” of a fuel cell can mean different things, depending 

on the different constraints that are imposed to a given engineering problem. For instance, if 

there were no irreversibilities then all Gibbs energy would be converted into electrical energy 

and, if the reference is taken to be the Gibbs energy itself, the efficiency could be said to be 

100%.  Evidently, this is not a helpful definition for the efficiency when only considering 

reversible transformations. Since fuel cells use feed materials that are also commonly burnt to 

release their energy (e.g., as in combustion-based processes), and to get a good comparison 

with these other fuel-using systems, the efficiency of the fuel cell is often defined as
[ 4, 8, 68]

  

                                           

    
 (2.7) 

 

Where     is the heat that would be released by burning the fuel. More precisely, in this case, 

it is the change in the enthalpy of the electrochemical reaction. However, even this definition is 

not free of ambiguities, as there are two different values that can be attributed to    , the 

difference being the enthalpy of vaporization of water, that is, whether the product water was 

considered to be condensed back to liquid or not. Thus an efficiency value should mention 

whether it relates to the higher heating value (HHV) or lower heating value (LHV) of the fuel. 

Because the SOFC operates at high temperatures (and at moderated to low operating 

pressures, i.e.        ), the water is assumed to be in gas phase. 

All in all, based on the above definition one can see that there is a limit to the cell 

efficiency, even if the maximum electrical energy available is equal to the change in Gibbs 

energy, in this case 

     
   

   
 (2.8) 



Chapter 2 ? Preliminaries on The Physical Chemistry of SOFCs 38 
 

This maximum efficiency (    ) limit is usually referred to as the “thermodynamic efficiency” of 

a fuel cell, and is also a function of the temperature, and the state of reactants and products.  

This result of choosing     among several possible alternatives of “energy reference” is also 

grounded on thermodynamic arguments. For a reaction running under constant pressure and 

temperature, the following well-known thermodynamic relation is shown to hold
[ 74]

:

For a hydrogen fuel cell      ,      , and      . Thus |   |  |   | and          

Equation (2.9) can be viewed as a global thermodynamic limitation of the electrochemical 

energy conversion process. Equation (2.8) may be expressed as a function of OCV: 

     
   

   
  

         

   
  

    
  

 , with    
    

    
 (2.10) 

 

The actual efficiency (     ) of the fuel cell can be obtained from Eq. (2.10), if the actual 

voltage (     ) is used in place of the open-circuit voltage: 

       
     
  

 (2.11) 

 

The equation above still bears some theoretical idealization in comparison to real operating 

conditions, because in practice it is found that not all the fuel feed to the cell can be utilized. 

For reasons to be explained in Chapter 3, some fuel should remain unreacted, fact that 

reduces the cell electric current when compared to the condition in which the fuel is fully 

reacted. Thus, the “real” cell efficiency is lower than that calculated by Eq. (2.11). Nonetheless, 

this equation serves the purpose of making it explicit that fuel cell efficiency is related to both 

the reversible (    ) and operating (     ) voltages. Therefore, the mathematical models that 

evaluate “concentration-induced losses” (or other types of losses), and their respective impact 

on the reduction of the cell operating voltage, are in fact trying to assess some aspect related 

to SOFC operating efficiency. 

 

 

As noted before, changes in Gibbs energy can vary with temperature, pressure, 

concentration of chemical species, and also with electrical state properties. Particularly, the 

change in the Gibbs energy of reaction (2.1), for a constant temperature process, may be 

expressed using the activity of reactants and products
[ 67] 

            
           (

where    
  is the change in Gibbs energy of reaction at a specified standard (reference  ) 

state;      (        ) is the chemical activity of  -th species, which is a function of 

temperature, pressure, and the concentration of all chemical species   participating in the 

reaction. Equation (2.12) can be used to calculate     , by substituting it into Eq. (2.5): 

      
  

  

  
  (

        
  ?

    
) (2.13) 

 

where    is EMF at the reference state. Equation (2.13), which gives the EMF in terms of 

products/reactants, is the Nernst equation specifically for reaction (2.1). The EMF calculated 

from such equations is also known as the “Nernst voltage” and it is the reversible cell voltage 

that would exist at a given temperature, pressure, and species concentrations.   

One may further manipulate Eq. (2.13) to get the explicit effects of species 

concentrations and system pressure. For example, if it is assumed that all the gas species 

behave as an ideal gas (which can be generally considered as a reasonable approximation, for 

the typical case of a SOFC operating at 1000    and 0.1    ), then one can write

The Nernst equation (2.15) shows how the EMF of a fuel cell is related to the system 

pressure according to the term       ?       ?  . Thus, if the total pressure changes from an 

equilibrium state with a pressure    to other with a pressure   , with everything else held 

constant, Eq. (2.15) predicts a change of voltage 

      
   

   
  (

  
  

) (2.16) 

 

The formulae presented in the foregoing are restricted to processes obeying equilibrium 

thermodynamics, i.e. irreversible losses at electrodes are not formally taken into account. Even 

though the idealized behavior predicted by Eq. (2.16) is show to hold, approximately, under 

some operating conditions, it is not generally true, e.g., raising system pressure can actually 

lead to a greater voltage increase than that predicted by Eq. (2.16), because it could also 

reduce certain irreversibilities at electrodes
[ 8, 75]

. Moreover, Eq. (2.16) is a specific result of 

considering the reaction (2.1), oxidation of pure hydrogen with pure oxygen, for which the 

volumes of products are smaller than the cumulative volume of reactants. This may not be so 

in general, as in the case of the oxidation of methane, for which the cumulative volume of 



Chapter 2 ? Preliminaries on The Physical Chemistry of SOFCs 40 
 

reactants and products is the same (i.e., there is no net change of volume; see also §§3.4.2). 

Thus, for this reaction there is theoretically no change in the cell reversible voltage caused by 

the system thermodynamic pressure. This dependence on volume change (   ) can be easily 

seen by differentiating Eq. (2.6) with respect to pressure, under a constant temperature:

One of the main simplifying assumptions used in this work is that cell layers (PEN) can 

be considered spatially isothermal. Therefore, analyses such as the temperature dependence 

of      would be beyond the scope of this dissertation. Nevertheless, it is convenient to make 

one remark about this topic. A significant number of works by different researchers who have 

considered non-isothermal cases, by solving additional energy balances and heat transport 

equations, misprized the importance of the dependence of      on local temperature. This is 

probably because there is in the literature an ingrained assumption that      does not depend 

(or depends negligibly) on temperature
[4,7,8,12,67,68]

.  

Notwithstanding such assumption is ubiquitous in the literature, it appears to be little 

discussion to confirm, experimentally, its generality when using it coupled to local property 

balances (i.e., under non-equilibrium conditions). The habitual rationale
[67, 68]

 to “prove” that 

     does not depend on temperature is to start from the Gibbs energy equation, locally 

assuming constant pressure and constant mole number for each and all chemical species (as 

in a “closed system”). Then, under these assumptions, the dependence of         on 

temperature is disregarded for practical purposes. Nonetheless, the reference state   should 

be selected with criterion (not too far from the cell average operating temperature). A 

somewhat more complete (still approximate) expression than Eq. (2.13) can be given as
[67]

The theoretical value of the open circuit voltage (i.e., at the condition of zero net current 

density) is given by Eq. (2.6). However, when useful current is drawn from the fuel cell, it is 

found that the actual voltage is often considerably less than this value
[ 8, 13, 68]

. In the Fig. 2.1 

below, a typical
1
 plot of cell voltage against current density (“         curve”) is shown and a 

number of characteristics, affecting the fuel cell performance, should be noticed:

? The open circuit voltage (    ) is less than the theoretical value (    ). Although 

for high-temperature fuel cells (as it is case of SOFCs) the reversible “no loss” 

voltage is lower, the onset cell operating voltage (    ) is usually higher, because 

the irreversibilities associated to this particular voltage drop (         ) are 

smaller. 
 

? In the case of low-temperature fuel cells, there is a rapid initial fall in voltage. For 

SOFCs, this initial fall in voltage is less intense and sometimes almost 

“imperceptible” (actually, it is usually unresolved on the physical scale of interest).  
 

? The voltage then falls less rapidly, and more linearly, as the current density 

increases. 
 

? Under specific conditions, voltage falls rapidly again at higher current densities.

As already pointed out,       can be seen as a measure of SOFC efficiency. Thus 

maintaining a minimum threshold for the cell voltage, even under high current loads, is critical 

to the successful deployment of SOFC technology. However, due to limitations of the existing 

technology, it is difficult to achieve high electric power density. Understanding these limitations 

still represents a formidable effort in the research and development of SOFCs
[ 13, 14, 70]

. The 

difference between the voltage one would expect from a fuel cell operating ideally (reversibly) 

and the actual voltage is what entails the discussion that will follow. More specifically, that 

difference rooted in the “limitations of mass transport”, which is the main concern that drove 

this research work. The terminology used in the literature to refer to the causes of such 

difference (voltage drop) varies. However, herein it will be referred to as “losses”, 

“polarizations”, or more generally as “irreversibilities”. At times it may be also referred to as 

“overvoltage”, but this term when employed will refer only to those local voltage differences 

stemming from interfacial phenomena at the TPB of an electrode. 

 

 

The characteristic shape of the cell i       curve (see figures 2.1 and 2.2) results from 

non-equilibrium (irreversible) processes taking place within the SOFC. There are three major 

losses that are usually recognized as dominant polarizations
[ 76, 4, 8, 68]

, and one minor loss that, 

howsoever small, will be listed here for the sake of completeness (this “minor loss” is 

sometimes not included in the list of electrode polarizations). These losses will be outlined just 

briefly in the following. “Concentration-induced losses” will be considered in more detail in 

Chapter 3; other losses will be just summarized to further the understanding of their mutual 

interaction, but no in-depth discussions will be presented. They are not within the scope of this 

work, which intends to be limited to the critical analysis of phenomena related to mass transfer.  

1. Activation polarization/losses: electrode reactions involve charge (electron) 

transfer as a fundamental step, through which a neutral species is converted into 

an ion, and vice versa. The net current density is proportional to the rate of 

electrochemical reactions and associated with this reaction rate there is a loss in 

voltage, called activation polarization
2
 or overvoltage (    ). This “voltage drop” is 

caused by the relative slowness of reactions taking place on the surface of 

electrodes
[ 76]

, wherein a fraction of the “available voltage” (    ) is lost in driving 

the reaction that transfers electrons to or from electrodes. Charge transfer is a 

multi-step process, usually comprising several parallel reactions pathways, 

including, but not limited to: charge transfer reaction at or near the TPB; surface 

diffusion; surface physisorption; and competitive chemisorption. The reaction 

mechanism describing such multiplicity of pathways is material and 

microstructure-dependent, i.e. electrode processes and micromorphology are 

                                                      
2
  Terminology seems to be related to the thermally-activated nature of the reaction involved

. 



Chapter 2 ? Preliminaries on The Physical Chemistry of SOFCs 43 
 

closely interrelated. Thus, in practical terms, it is not feasible to propose a single, 

general reaction mechanism for neither cathodic (oxygen reduction) nor anodic 

(fuel oxidation) half-cell reactions. Moreover, it is often difficult to select a single 

rate-determining step (if existent, that is) and thus it is common practice in the 

literature to describe the overall process (“rate law”) using a phenomenological 

treatment (phenomenological electrode kinetics). An example of such approach is 

the use of phenomenological equations such as Butler-Volmer equation, Tafel 

equation, and the like. 

 

2. Ohmic polarization/losses: with the exception of superconductors, matter will most 

certainly offer resistance to the motion of electrical charges. Ohmic polarization 

(    ) is the voltage drop due to the resistance to the flow of electric charges 

through the materials of electrodes and the various electronic interconnections of 

a SOFC; it also accounts for the resistance to the flow of oxide ions through the 

electrolyte
3
. In the common case, when a linear behavior between voltage drop 

and current density is assumed, this polarization can be described by Ohm’s law 

and for this reason it is often called Ohmic loss. Such polarization is also referred 

to as resistive loss, a more general denotation, not restricted to Ohmic behavior. 

Resistive losses can be evaluated by material constitutive relations, in which 

specific material properties, such as the resistivity, govern the response of cell 

voltage to the passage of a finite current. Therefore, the transport of oxide ions 

through the solid electrolyte is said to be governed by its ionic resistivity; and the 

transport of electrons (or electron holes) through the electrodes is governed by 

electronic resistivities
4
. In SOFCs, the major contribution to      is usually from 

the electrolyte phase, since its ionic resistivity is fairly greater than the electronic 

resistivities of cathode, anode, and interconnections. Such contribution can be 

quite large in the case of thick electrolyte-supported cells.  However, it is usually 

smaller in electrode-supported cells, when thin electrolytes are employed
[ 13]

. 
 

3. Concentration polarization/losses: at (or near) the anode/electrolyte interface, 

electroactive fuel species (e.g.,    and/or   ) must be present to form the 

respective products (e.g.,     and/or    ) through an electrochemical oxidation 

reaction. Meanwhile, at (or near) the cathode/electrolyte interface, electroactive 

oxidant species (  ) must be present to form the respective products ( 
  ) 

through an electrochemical reduction reaction. Therefore, the transport (and in 

situ generation, when this is also the case) of fuel and oxidant within SOFC layers 

must be consistent with the net electric current flowing through the cell. In other 

words, electroactive species are adjusted through charge and mass “balance 

laws”, subjected to additional internal and external system constraints. The 

knowledge of how these species reach the electrode/electrolyte interface (i.e., 

TPBs) informs us about what “physicochemical resistances” must be overcome, at 

a given current density value. These resistances are reflected as an overall 

                                                      
3
 Or also through the electrode, when this electrode is a mixed ionic–electronic conductor (MIEC).  

 
4
 In a homogenized macroscale description, resistivities should be corrected for the effective medium parameters 

(e.g., porosity, tortuosity), and also for the possible existence of secondary contact-insulating phases. 



Chapter 2 ? Preliminaries on The Physical Chemistry of SOFCs 44 
 

“voltage loss” known as concentration polarization (     ). Because an “adverse 

concentration” is the result of the “failure to transport” sufficient electroactive 

species to/from the TPB region, this type of loss has been also termed as a mass 

transport loss (see further discussion in Chapter 3). 
 

4. Electronic Leakage (parasitic losses): an ideal electrolyte should only transport 

ionic charges (ions) through the cell.  However, this condition is often difficult to 

satisfy completely in practice and a certain amount of electron conduction through 

the electrolyte phase (“electronic leakage current”) is possible to occur
[ 8]

. The 

electrical conduction in the electrolyte, though mainly carried by oxide ions, can 

have a small but yet deleterious contribution from electrons. This effect have a 

marked effect on the OCV, which is reduced by an amount      , depending upon 

the electrolyte material, operating temperature, and oxygen partial pressure (   ) 

profile through de cell
[ 8]

. This voltage drop should be more acute when there is a 

very low oxygen partial pressure at the electrolyte/anode interface
[ 8]

. This effect is 

usually not important in modern SOFC electrolyte materials and thus it is often 

disregarded in most modeling studies (as will be seen in Chapter 4). 

 

 
Figure 2.2: schematic-only i      curve. The voltage is a decreasing function of current density due to 
unavoidable losses (polarizations). The more electric current that is drawn from the cell, the greater these losses 
are. Each of these losses can be associated with some underlying non-equilibrium process. Polarization regions 
may (and often do) overlap, and thus they cannot be separated in a strict sense, as in this figure

Chapter 2 ? Preliminaries on The Physical Chemistry of SOFCs 45 
 

 

From a mathematical modeling perspective, it is convenient to formulate an equation 

that would bring together all the previously mentioned irreversibilities (    ,      ,      ,      ) 

and relate them with the actual cell voltage (     ). This equation could be used, for instance, 

for either calculating the cell voltage or to distinguish between losses. However, such equation 

requires, for its formulation, some degree of arbitrariness on how to define each of the 

irreversibilities separately, because polarization regions may (and often do) overlap, and thus 

they cannot be separated in a strict sense. 

Two main assumptions are made to support the formulation of this equation: (i) that a 

continuum description can be applied on the electrode-level; and (ii) the presumed additivity of 

“voltage losses”. Although the additivty property assumption could be proved for systems 

under thermodynamic equilibrium, this is not so for those under non-equilibrium conditions
[ 77, 

78]
. The last statement is surely ambiguous, as these voltage losses can only exist under non-

equilibrium conditions. The usual workaround in the literature, to deal with this “teleological 

hindrance”, is to invoke the local equilibrium postulate
[ 79, 80]

. In this work, this assumption is 

taken as a valid precept. Nevertheless, the point here is to emphasize that, although 

empirically correct, the yet-to-be-proposed equation should be considered already in a 

simplified form to the detriment of its usefulness and practicality. 

At zero net current, SOFC electrodes should provide (theoretically) the thermodynamic 

or reversible voltage (          ). The connection of a load, thereby closing the electrical 

circuit, should induce a net current density ( ) in the SOFC and reduce       by the overall 

value of voltage losses,               . Thus the current drawn from the cell “costs” some 

potential and the thermodynamically predicted voltage (    ) may be viewed as the “capital” at 

one’s disposal
[ 12]

. 

                        (2.19) 

 

Equation (2.19) is assumed to be valid at steady-state condition, at a given space coordinate. 

Moreover, in Eq. (2.19) the Nernst voltage      is assumed not to be a function of  .  This 

assumption is valid if, for instance, the mass transport rates of fuel and oxidant are sufficiently 

high so that species concentrations in gas channels (or at other adequate reference condition) 

are invariant with respect to current density. Otherwise,       must be treated as a function of  :  

                           (2.20) 

 

Thus, the difference                     may be understood as a measure of the change in 

the reference composition of gas-phase (at constant   and  ), due to a finite change    in the 



Chapter 2 ? Preliminaries on The Physical Chemistry of SOFCs 46 
 

current. As it will be explained further below, the correct definition of       and       depends 

on where one choses the “reference gas concentration” to be located at. For instance, either at 

the bulk of gas channels (    
    ) or at the percolated TPB regions (    

   ). Equation (2.20) 

suggests that one may calculate the actual cell voltage output, starting with the thermodynamic 

predicted voltage and then subtracting out all the losses (voltage drops): 

                                  (2.21) 

 

Equation (2.21) sets a convenient way to depict the combined effects from the major 

phenomena that affect SOFC power throughput. For this reason, this equation has been used 

in the literature as a baseline for a wide spectrum of modeling techniques: from microscopic to 

macroscopic scale models; from phenomenological differential forms, to algebraic 

experimentally-fitted engineering forms (e.g., empirical distributed-parameter models). 

Therefore, both the general form of Eq. (2.21) and specific expressions (submodels) for the 

different irreversibilities vary widely, depending on the modeling approach
[ 1, 2, 72, 81]

. 

Deceptively simple in appearance, this equation can “encapsulate” quite sophisticated models 

to calculate each type of polarization, thus supporting complex numerical simulations of 

SOFCs (see Chapter 4). Some additional remarks about Eq. (2.21): 

? This equation, even when applied with seemingly basic fuel cell submodels, has 

been found to give good fit with the results of real SOFCs, based on evidence 

derived from experiments
[ 4, 8]

. 
  
? The question of which processes contribute to      , how large is each 

contribution, and in what conditions they contribute, dictates the final format of this 

equation. Thus, to simplify this equation, one usually neglects the terms with little 

impact on operating losses. For important terms, the desired accuracy is crucial 

criterion for selecting the modeling complexity of each submodel in Eq. (2.21). 
 

? As a phenomenological equation derived based on energy conservation, its 

theoretical background (e.g., supporting assumptions) is evaluated by its verifiable 

empirical consequences, independently of any fundamental model possibly 

supporting it. This implies more freedom in the interpretation and use of formulas 

based on Eq. (2.21). 

 
Equation (2.21) can also be casted into a form that makes the problem’s dimensionality 

explicit, for example, when solving the one-dimensional distribution of cell voltage along the 

bulk flow direction ( ) of the SOFC.  This form not only allows to pinpoint the highest 

achievable EMF (    ) in the cell, but also the influence of the local current density     . For 

instance, this local description can help to identify regions where highly concentrated current 

densities are present
 
and then verify whether a failure mechanism might be associated with 



Chapter 2 ? Preliminaries on The Physical Chemistry of SOFCs 47 
 

high localized values
[ 8]

. When used for calculating local electrochemical quantities, this 

equation may be rewritten as: 

                                                        (2.22) 

 

Where the cell voltage       is held invariant along the fuel flow direction. This is the case when 

the SOFC operation is assumed iso-potential along the   direction (i.e., when the electrical 

resistance of current-collecting bus bars along the flow direction is much lower than that of 

PEN’s through-plane direction). This assumption is mostly true in real, “well designed” SOFCs
[ 

7, 8, 29]
. Thus, at first, it can be adopted for the purposes of this work. The concentration and 

activation polarizations can be further divided into anodic and cathodic contributions, 

                   (2.23)

Figure 2.3 illustrates the basic idea conveyed by Eq. (2.27): part of the thermodynamic 

available voltage must be “sacrificed” to produce a net current (for simplicity, only activation 

and ohmic polarizations have been indicated on this figure). More specifically, cell operation 

requires sacrificing a fraction
 
of both anode and cathode Galvani potentials

6
, which are 

lowered by       and      , respectively
[ 68]

. Within the electrolyte, voltage gradient is present in 

order to drive the transport of charges down the cell and, as charge transport is not a 

“frictionless process”, it results in a voltage loss of     . Here it is important to add some 

elucidative comments concerning the voltage profiles as shown on Fig. 2.3: 

? Electrolyte was assumed as a purely ionic-conducting material and the electrodes 

as ideal electronic conductors. Thus no ohmic losses were considered in the 

electrodes. 
 

? Electrode activation polarizations are not physically meaningful differences in 

terms of electric/electrostatic potentials. That is, they do not represent real 

potential drops along a given electric potential profile (e.g., blue line), but a 

                                                      
5
 Explanations for the use of absolute values in the case of cathodic terms will be provided in the next pages. 

 
6
 Galvani potentials are said to be “equilibrium interfacial potentials”, at anode/electrolyte and cathode/electrolyte 

reaction interfaces, which must sum to give the overall reversible voltage (see also §§2.3.1 and §§2.3.2). 



Chapter 2 ? Preliminaries on The Physical Chemistry of SOFCs 48 
 

“virtual” potential difference between polarised and unpolarised cases (the 

difference between the red and blue lines). 
 

? In this specific example, the measured cell voltage was given as the sum of 

electric potentials differences at the anode and cathode sides. Thus, from Fig. 2.3 

one has: 
 

      (             )  (             )                   (2.28)

equilibrium. (a) Effect of anode and cathode activation losses. (b) Effect of ohmic losses. Here, Galvani potentials 
are evaluated with reference to the electrolyte potential (figure by the author based on an example from [ 68]). 

 
In the specific case of Eq. (2.28) (and thus of Fig. 2.3), both Eq. (2.26) and Eq. (2.27) 

hold. As will be discussed further below, a stricter definition of activation polarizations will

has been applied in several works from the literature, as in Fig. 2.4
[ 72]

, in which the voltage 

profile          is explicitly solved for through the PEN thickness. Nonetheless, it should be 

mentioned that the definition given by Eq. (2.29) is not the only one found in the literature, in 

terms of sign (i.e., polarity) convention.  

 

 

 
Figure 2.4: Simulated distributions of the electric potential in a polarized SOFC (figure modified from [ 72]). 

 
In the example of Fig. 2.4, electric potentials where reflected around the abscissa axis 

in comparison with Fig. 2.3, and the cathode side is now grounded (set to zero) as a fixed 

reference. In Fig. 2.4, the cell voltage is given by 

              (2.30) 

 

where     and     are the electric potentials of the cathode and anode, respectively (    was 

set to zero as reference). Electrodes are at different potentials as a result of the two electric 

potentials steps that form at electrical double-layers
[ 67]

, at the anode/electrolyte and 

cathode/electrolyte interfaces,      and     , respectively: 

                      
(2.31) 

                     
 

where          and          are the electric potentials in the electrolyte just beyond the space-

charge-region, on the cathode and anode sides, respectively. Thus, from Eq. (2.30) and (2.31)

Note the signal change in front of      . These formulations are indeed awkward when 

describing “antiparallel processes” occurring at the anode and cathode, where the faradaic net 

current changes signal, and such formulations are at times source of errors in the literature. 

For instance, a number of authors admit the absolute value of cathodic activation polarization 

in Eq. (2.27), not considering the same treatment for the cathodic concentration polarization. 

This could suggest the interpretation that 

                       |     |              (2.34) 

 

which is incorrect, because in the case of Fig. 2.4, which is based on the definitions of Eq. 

(2.30) and (2.31), both       and       are negative signed (cathodic polarity).  Thus, in Eq. 

(2.34)        is added to      instead of being subtracted from it. One could alter the definition 

of the concentration polarization       so it results positive, but such procedure lacks 

thermodynamic consistency (see discussion in §§3.3). There are other situations in which       

and       might lead to issues with regard to their signals. For example, when using Tafel 

approximation in the low current limit
[ 67]

. The important remark is that Eq. (2.27) is a statement 

of the first law of thermodynamics and, as such, should be intrinsically consistent. The mere 

use of absolute values appears to be an artifice (see discussion in §§2.3.1 and §§2.3.2). 

Nonetheless, the fact that       is positive and       is negative depicts a real physical situation 

where electrochemical reactions proceed in the anodic direction at the anode and in the 

cathodic direction at the cathode (assuming that the definition given by Eq. (2.29) is equally 

applied to both cathode and anode). 

In Eq. (2.27) the concentration polarization can be accounted for in different ways, for 

which there are two frequently used approaches. The first one proposes a submodel to 

calculate       (thus       and      ) and is commonly referred to as one having an explicit 

(often semi-empirical) evaluation of concentration polarization
[ 82]

. The other approach does not 

prescribe a particular expression to      . In fact, in this approach, this term does not 

(explicitly) appear. The latter modeling technique
[ 83, 72, 84, 85]

 considers additional mass transfer 

governing equations to solve for the concentration of electrochemical species at the TPBs. In 

this case, Eq. (2.27) is slightly modified: 

          
                       |     | (2.35) 

 

Where     
    is the Nernst voltage evaluated at the TPB. For example, in the case of reaction 

(1.2),

where         and          are the partial pressures of    and     at anodic TPBs;         is the 

partial pressure of    at cathodic TPBs. Therefore, this latter approach implicitly evaluates 

      inside the term     
    (i.e., it evaluates the result of     

           |     |). Still using the 

example of reaction (1.2), Eq. (2.35) can be obtained using the following definitions (see 

§§3.3.1 for the respective derivation): 

      
  

  
   (

) (2.38) 

 

Note that Eq. (2.37) and (2.38) are just possible definitions for the anode and cathode 

concentration polarizations (see Chapter 3) and not actual modeling equations. Substituting 

Eq. (2.37) and (2.38) in Eq. (2.27), and also making use of Eq. (2.15), yields:

There are several, though not arbitrary, ways to elaborate the necessary set of 

equations concerning the definition of electric (inner) potentials and their differences, 

electromotive “forces”, and polarizations. Nevertheless, thermodynamic consistency should be 

ensured and results must be physically meaningful (e.g., negative charges in order to perform 

work should not flow from high potential states to lower potential states). Firstly, one needs to 

establish certain primary definitions to close the set of equations, or otherwise one will end up 



Chapter 2 ? Preliminaries on The Physical Chemistry of SOFCs 52 
 

running around in a circle. The starting point is the definition of activation polarization and, 

most importantly, its sign (polarity) convention.  

                   (2.40) 
 

                   (2.41) 
 

Equations (2.40)and (2.41) indicate that shifting the electrode-electrolyte potential step 

(  ) in relation to the equilibrium value (    ) will bias the direction of the electrochemical 

reaction (see Fig. 2.5). If the electrode/electrolyte potential step is made relatively more 

negative than the equilibrium Galvani potential, that is       , the reaction will be biased 

towards the reduction process. On the other hand, if the potential step is made relatively more 

positive than the equilibrium value,         the reaction will be biased toward the oxidation 

process. Accordingly, if        the potential step equals that of thermodynamic equilibrium 

and oxidation and reduction half-processes are balanced at a given TPB
[ 68]

 (see also §§2.3.2). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 2.5: By changing the electrode potential one can trigger reduction (left) or oxidation (right) processes. The 
situation in the middle corresponds to the thermodynamic equilibrium (figure adapted from [ 68]). 

 

Once      has been defined by Eq. (2.40) and (2.41), the reasoning on how to express 

   is an important aspect that some works in the literature
[ 72]

 overlook. This aspect can cause 

confusion when deriving the Nernst equation for half-cell reactions. In principle, the potential 

step might be evaluated as either                or               ,. Before specifying 

which of the two definitions to use, a few more mathematical assertions should be elaborated.

Eq. (2.47), the LHS is

It stands to reason that this question refer to the same problem on how to define   . 

The absolute electrode-electrolyte (or Galvani) potential difference (  ) is a conceptual 

synthesis of two individual sources of potential difference through electrified interfaces (i.e., 

electric double-layers): it is, theoretically, the sum of potential differences due to charge

, as will be seen from the discussion to follow. The Galvani 

potential difference across the phase boundary (interface) of a metal( )-electrolyte( ) can be 

identified as the difference of two inner potentials,    and   : 

            (2.50) 

 

where       represents the difference of inner potentials of the bulk phases   and  . The 

potential through an electrochemical system, which is a succession of interfaces, is the sum of 

all the potential differences through these interfaces. Since each interfacial potential difference 

is a difference of inner potentials, the potential difference through the cell may be written as the 

sum of all the inner potentials at the various interfaces

Where        represents the difference of inner potentials of the phases    and  , and 

        is the    across the  -th extra phase boundary. Consider a simple system (or cell) 

made up of the interfaces    ? ,    ?  , and     
  ? , with   

   being the same metal as   . If 

the potential difference through this system is written in an expanded form using Eq. (2.51), 

then

  ) 

 

                                (       
  ) 

(2.52) 

Therefore, from Eq. (2.49) and (2.52) one can argue that, under thermodynamic 

equilibrium (i.e., zero net current density), 

           
   

       
   

                   (2.53) 

 

And accordingly, 

                       (2.54) 

 

Which is the same as Eq. (2.30). Finally, one should note that both the definition of    and the 

particular form of Eq. (2.40) and (2.41) are interrelated. To illustrate this point, let us admit the 

following definition for    as suggested by Eq. (2.52): 

                   
(2.55) 

                  
 

              (             )  (             )                 (2.56) 

 

Substituting Eq. (2.40) and (2.41) in Eq. (2.56), then 

      (               )                      

(2.57) 

                                

where                     . In Eq. (2.57), however, the value of         is added to      

unless 

                                            (2.58) 

 

which is the opposite situation depicted for the anode case, in that the reaction should be 

biased toward the oxidation (anodic) process, when the electrode-electrolyte potential step is 

made relatively more positive than the equilibrium potential. As a result of this incongru ence, 

one concludes that Eq. (2.31) must be used with Eq. (2.40) and (2.41), in lieu of Eq. (2.55): 

                   
 

                  
 

In other words, Eq. (2.40) and Eq. (2.41), when combined with the sign convention established 

for      (see Fig. 2.5), results in the definition of    as expressed by Eq. (2.30). Moreover, this 

latter equation is consistent with the formal macroscopic definition/interpretation of    (see 

§§2.3.2). 



Chapter 2 ? Preliminaries on The Physical Chemistry of SOFCs 56 
 

As mentioned earlier, the potential difference    through an electrified electrode-

electrolyte Interface is the sum of two different potential differences
[ 86]

: one due to charge 

separation ( ) and the other due to dipole orientation ( ). Each of these potential differences 

represent the work needed to transport a unit test charge from infinity in vacuum, through 

dipole layers, to a point located at a charged electrolyte or electrode (see Fig. 2.6). One should 

differentiate between the concepts of electric potential and Galvani (inner) potential. The 

former is a more comprehensive physical quantity, which also includes Galvani potentials (both 

are scalar quantities measured in Volts and that can be associated with some electrical energy 

scale). The latter, however, besides being quantified as an electric potential, has a specific 

meaning:   represents the electrical work needed when a charged particle is transferred from 

infinite separation in vacuum through a surface shell, which contains excess charges and 

oriented dipoles.  

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 2.6: schematics for the definition of   at a point  .     is related to the total work done in bringing a unit 
test charge (over each acts columbic forces   ) along the   axis, from infinity up to that point  , just inside a given 
bulk phase  (electrolyte or electrode). (figure by the author). 

 
Therefore, the definition of Galvani potential requires the presence of charged interfaces, 

whereas electric potentials, in general, do not. The Galvani potential difference (  ) has an even 

more specific meaning: it is a surface potential difference between two potentials through the 

test charge

to recognize in what reference direction the potential differences are considered): 

      /           /                        (2.59) 

 

where        is calculated as the inner potential of electrode minus the inner potential of 

electrolyte, just beyond the space charge zone, regardless of the direction of electric current. 

Note that Eq. (2.59) matches exactly the definition of Eq. (2.31). In section §§2.3.2,    is 

addressed from the perspective of Eq. (2.40) and (2.41), i.e., from the perspective of the 

“driving force” for the charge-transfer reaction. Therein the sign of    is shown to be, again, 

physically relevant. 

So to conclude this section, a set of consistent equations is summarized below based 

on the definitions of Eq. (2.40) and (2.41), and on the sign convention of Fig. 2.5. In the 

derivation of these equations it was assumed that, for time-invariant systems, the following 

definition of a “generic electromotive force” ( ) holds:

     (2.81) 

 

Taking into account the above definitions for electric potential differences, one sees that 

  may be identified as the so-called “electrode oxidation potential” (    ), which is associated 

with the oxidation half-reaction of that electrode: 

                               (   
   

  
  

 
   

)

                               (   
   

  
  

 
   

)
  

 (2.78b) 

 

Using Eq. (2.79a) and ignoring ohmic losses, one obtains 

                                      (2.79b) 

 

This is a well-known equation in which the potentials of the half-cells are added to get the 

overall standard cell potential (EMF) of an electrochemical cell. Thus      is identified, in the 

case of criteria and conventions used in this work, as the “electrode reduction potential” (    ) 

associated with the reduction half-reaction of the considered electrode, at equilibrium. 



Chapter 2 ? Preliminaries on The Physical Chemistry of SOFCs 59 
 

More specifically on what concerns Eq. (2.66), published papers in SOFC literature 

usually assume that, in equilibrium situations, the condition    
            

         is always 

verified. For such condition to be true, the following assumptions should (at least 

approximately) hold: 

i. The chemical potential of oxygen ions (    ) should be constant throughout the 

electrolyte thickness. That is, the concentration of charge carriers is “high enough” 

so that there is no material composition variation along this phase
[ 87]

; and the 

electrolyte phase should be also free of meaningful temperature gradients. 
 

ii. The equilibrium chemical activity of oxygen ions, at the TPBs on both sides 

(anode and cathode), should not depend on the nature of the adjacent gas 

atmosphere (both contact chemistry and space charge zone), as will be discussed 

in §§3.3.2. 

 

Based on the above considerations, the following simplified expression is more commonly 

found in the literature (the subscripts “  ” and “  ” were omitted for simplicity): 

       
   

        
   

  
   

  
 

  

  
  (

        

         ?       
) (2.82) 

 

 

As presented in §§2.3.1, the physical origin of potential step (  ) is the electric 

potential difference through surface shells that contain excess electric charges and oriented 

dipoles. In SOFCs, these surface shells form at solid/solid (grain boundary) interfaces wherein 

electrochemical charge-transfer reactions take place, locally interconverting ionic and 

electronic currents to and from those solid phases (see Fig. 2.7). More precisely, the charge-

transfer is related to the surface potential difference between the inner potential of electrode 

(     ) and the inner potential of electrolyte (     ). As the charge carrier, inside the ionic 

phase (oxide ion) or electronic phase (electron), approaches the solid/solid interface, it 

encounters a steep potential cliff (  ) that ultimately drives the emission current through the 

phase boundary (i.e., the number of charges jumping out of or striking a unity area of surface 

per unit time). Thus, electrochemical kinetics is a function of   , which in the anode case, for 

example, can be expressed in a local form as (see Eq. (2.59)): 

      ?         ?           ?    (2.83)

 As described in Chapter 1, oxygen ions are conducted in the “electrolyte phase” (e.g.,    ) and electrons in the 

“electronic phase” (e.g.,   ) of a SOFC composite electrode.

reactions, and the transport of gas-phase species lead to a spatial distribution of inner 

potentials   within the considered phases. This spatial distribution occurs mainly along the 

thickness of the electrode
[ 7, 8, 13]

, if the problem is assumed one-dimensional, i.e.       , as 

it is illustrated on Fig. 2.7. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Figure 2.7: schematic depiction of a reaction mechanism (hydrogen spillover) of charge-transfer at the TPB 
(electrode, electrolyte, and gas phases) of a SOFC composite anode. Shown is the case of a purely ionic 
conducting electrolyte and purely electronic conducting electrode (figure by the author based on the description 
from [ 72]). 
 

The goal is to obtain one possible set of governing equations and closure relations for 

the processes (transport and reaction) occurring on solid phases, so that      and current 

densities can be related to one another. In the analysis that follows, the contribution of the gas-

phase to this relation will be restricted to the Butler–Volmer and Nernst phenomenological 

formalisms. When deriving the set of equations, one will not be concerned in mapping out the 

region of validity of the model (such as their eventual limitation to near-equilibrium conditions). 

This type of analysis is echoed by other references elsewhere in the literature
[ 8, 87, 69, 88, 89, 90]

. 

The current density   (A     ) in Eq. (2.83) is the one measured at the anodic and 

cathodic current collectors (i.e., the current that actually circulates around the outer circuit of 

SOFC). It is the sum of the Faradaic current    due to charge-transfer reactions and the current 

    due to the charging and discharging of electric double layers upon voltage transients. 

Considering three-dimensional electrodes, the total current    (A) follows from integration over 

the spatially varying volumetric values (volume-specific densities) of these currents,   
  and

Where     is the total current per unit area normal to the   direction (i.e., the cell current

   and    

   are the faradaic and double-layer currents flowing per unit area of the

the electric double-layer behaves as an ideal capacitor,     may be evaluated as
[ 67] 

   
      

       
     

  
 (2.86) 

 

This    
   current can alter the total electric current upon transient changes of the potential step 

  . However, under “macroscopic steady-state conditions” one normally assumes that the 

potential step is time-invariant within the characteristic time scale of our problem, and thus the 

RHS of Eq. (2.86) vanishes. Thus,

 and     (  
 )   

 

 (2.87) 

 

To calculate the local ionic current density        of the electrolyte phase, the following 

assumptions are also made: (i) the concentration of charge carriers is high enough so that 

there is no material composition variation along the phase; and (ii) the phase is free of 

meaningful temperature gradients. With such assumptions, one can say that there are no 

noticeable changes in the chemical potential of oxide ions and hence the electrical field 

remains as the dominant driving force within the electrolyte (see also §§3.3.1). Therefore, after 

applying the Nernst-Einstein equation
[ 87]

, one obtains 

           
               

     
      

  
 (2.88) 

 

where    
    is an effective ionic conductivity. Clearly, Eq. (2.88) is a statement of Ohm’s law. In 

the SOFC literature it is said at times
[ 91]

 that this equation refers to the so-called perfect ionic 

conductor. However, this assertion is an antinomy becuase in perfect conductors      for 

interior points (i.e., space charge density is zero).  Then, considering the continuity equation 

for electric charges under steady-state condition
[ 92] 

                          
    

  (2.89) 

 

The one-dimensional spatial derivative of the ionic current is thus given by 

    
  

    
  (2.90) 

 



Chapter 2 ? Preliminaries on The Physical Chemistry of SOFCs 62 
 

In Eq. (2.90)   
  is a volumetric source term (generally denoted by   ?  ), which represents local 

electrochemical reactions at TPB (e.g., see Eq.(2.111)). Combining Eq. (2.88) and (2.89) 

yields 

  (    
   

       )  
 

  
(    

   
 
      

  
)     

  (2.91) 

 

As the electrolyte (ionic) conductivity is typically several orders of magnitude lower than the 

electrode (electronic) conductivity, one may assume that the latter has a constant electric 

potential    , that is, it behaves as an “ideal conductor” when compared to electrolyte (see 

further discussion in §§2.3.3): 

    
  

   (2.92) 

 

Thus from Eq. (2.83) 

       

  
 

 (         )

  
  

      

  
 (2.93) 

 

Substituting Eq. (2.93) in Eq. (2.91) one finally obtains 

 

  
(   

    
       

  
)     

  (2.94) 

 

which is the (one-dimensional) macroscale-continuum governing equation for the spatial 

distribution of potential step    through the thickness of a composite anode.  

Now we turn our attention to the phenomenological relation between    and 

electrochemical reactions, in the light of chemical kinetics. In other words, here one seeks to 

obtain a clear, although succinct, view on the derivation of Butler-Volmer-based electrode 

kinetics, so that one could finally link this relation with the definition of activation polarization , 

Eq. (2.40) and Eq. (2.41).  Consider the following elementary step of a heterogeneous 

reaction
[ 87]

: 

A          (2.95) 

 

In which species   can change its nature and/or its position. If    , a pure transport step is 

being described. If     but conversely      can be assumed (or if differences in the 

position coordinate are unimportant), a homogeneous reaction is being addressed. Here   is 

the coordinate axis normal to the solid/solid interface wherein the electrochemical charge -

transfer reaction takes place, that is, it is the normal direction to the surface shell through 

which the potential difference (  ) develops (the “gray plane” in Fig. 2.7). Thus,    represents 

the jump distance, or displacement, from       to     or vice-versa.  For the archetype reaction

(2.95), the net flux      (composed of forward  ?  and backward  ?  contributions) of the particle 

number (  ) passing from   to  
 , in unit time,  can be formulated as: 

      ?   ?   ??         ??      
   (2.96) 

 

During this process the particles may or may not change their nature. The term      might be 

acknowledged as an analogous of net current density ( ). In Eq. (2.96),   is a rate constant 

which is independent of the particle density, but exponentially dependent on the chemical 

barrier to be overcome
[ 33, 93]

. For the forward jump one has:

The tilde indicates that the actual chemical barrier (  ??????  ) is modulated by the electrical 

field     ? , that is, the Gibbs energy profile of the electrochemical reaction is distorted by 

the energy step       according to
[ 87]

 (see also Fig. 2.8): 

  ???????     ???????       ?           (

drop    (dotted line). The activation energy for the forward reaction is increased by  ???       , whereas for the 
reverse reaction it is reduced by     ???         (figure by the author). 

 
According to Fig. 2.8, the activation energy for the reaction from left to right (or right to left) is 

increased (or reduced) by  ?      (or  ?     ), where   ? and  ? are symmetry factors. On 

account of the applied field (     ? ), if  ?     ? the barrier is no longer symmetrical. Thus,

At thermodynamic equilibrium, it is noted that the forward and reverse fluxes must 

balance, so that there is no net flux (      ). Thus, in the case depicted by Eq. (2.98) and 

Fig. 2.8, the “buildup of interfacial potential”            seeks to equalize such unbalanced 

situation, where the forward rate was (initially) faster than the reverse rate, due to unequal

Substituting Eq. (2.40), Eq. (2.107), and (2.108) in Eq. (2.96) one obtains the relation between 

the net particle flux density and the electric potential step:

(2.109) 

 

Equation (2.109) is a direct result of conditions imposed by Eq. (2.98), (2.99), and 

(2.100) (as per Fig. 2.8), which all together represent a reduction reaction. Or, to say it 

correctly, considering Eq. (2.96) in which   is the reactant being depleted and that by making 

   more negative favors the forward jump, this implies that   is reduced while in the reverse 

jump   is oxidized. The derivation of an alternative expression for       in the case that Eq. 

(2.96) is an oxidation reaction can be handled in a completely analogous fashion.  

One should note that the faradaic current in the cathodic half-cell has an opposite sign 

of that in the anodic half-cell, thus the resulting sign of      must be consistent in each of the 

half-cells. This is particularly important for equations in which      (or equivalently,   
 ) is 

incorporated as a source term, e.g., as in Eq. (2.90). Therefore, the above derivation 

procedure employs sign conventions and requires thermodynamic consistency. That is why in 

calculating the relationships between activation energies, Gibbs energy, overvoltages, and so 

forth, it is indispensable that signs are properly accounted for. More specifically, in the case of 

the Butler–Volmer equation (BVE), there is usually a certain convention in writing Eq. (2.109), 

regardless if the half-cell reaction is taking place at the cathode or anode. The forward reaction 

is an anodic process and the backward reaction is a cathodic process (at a given electrode): 

              {    [               ? ]     [                ? ] } (2.110) 

 

By way of example, and so to complete the set of equations that governs the spatial 

distribution of potential steps    (Eq. (2.94)), consider the following semi-empirical BVE used 

to calculate   
  (which, in this case, represents the current density per unit of TPB length) in a 

  /    anode
[ 91]

: 

  
    

                  {    [                ? ]     [               ? ] } (2.111) 

 

Where       (a morphological parameter) is the TPB length per unit volume of the porous 

electrode (e.g.,      ? ); and   
    (current per unit of TPB length) is the exchange current 

density fitted from patterned-electrode experiments
[ 94]

 according to

 (               ? )

   
   [             ? ] (2.112) 

 

Based on the above examination it is seen that the local activation polarization,        , 

“is free” of effects beyond those directly related to the electrochemical reaction very near a  

narrow region around the TPB site (e.g., charge-transfer reaction, local concentration-induced

losses, and local interfacial transport phenomena). Furthermore, within the BVE formalism,    

possess only macroscopic coherence (i.e., a “non-equilibrium surface potential difference” 

between the bulk of electrode and electrolyte), thereby ignoring its fundamental relation with 

the energy states of charge carriers and hiding most of the details about the electric boundary-

layer formed at the solid/solid interface. Phenomenological semi-empirical models such as 

Butler–Volmer kinetics seem to achieve good results under certain circumstances, despite 

their inherent “macroscopic degeneracy”
[ 87,67,75]

. In some situations, however, improved 

physical fidelity is required to correctly describe the mechanism of electrode overvoltage
[ 75,71]

.  

In order to have a deeper insight into the relation between    and the net current, it 

would be necessary to model the electron exchange processes at the phase boundary. When 

electrons flow (i.e., when an electronic current is established), the energy conservation implies 

that there must be an interfacial electric field (that is, a potential difference between the two 

bulk phases at their interface) that does the work on the transmitted electron. This work (which 

is proportional to    on the “microscale”) is the difference of the work function associated with 

the extraction of an electron from a molecule and the work function gained by inserting the 

electron to the solid conductor, or vice-versa
[ 95]

. The appreciation of this process (namely, the 

interaction between charge carriers and bulk materials) can be accomplished using models 

such as those from Thomas-Fermi theory
[ 96, 97]

 and molecular electronics
[ 98, 99]

. From the 

perspective of these models,    is a potential bias that appears as the difference between the 

local Fermi-energies (or, somewhat equivalently, between macroscale-continuum 

electrochemical potentials) on the electrode and electrolyte sides. As long as the potential bias 

between the two sides is maintained, current will flow through the system as the molecule tries 

(and fails) to reach equilibrium with both junctions. When    is positive (that is, when the 

Fermi energy on the electrode is lower than on the electrolyte), electrons will flow from the 

electrolyte to the electrode (accordingly, in this case, the current will flow from electrode to the 

electrolyte and its value is defined as being negative). Conversely, when    is negative, 

electrons will flow from the electrode to the electrolyte. This result endorses the definitions 

given by Eq. (2.40) and (2.41) in §§2.3.1. 

 

 

In the traditional design of SOFC anodes and cathodes (e.g.,   -    and    -    

composites, respectively), electrochemical reactions do not occur through the entire electrode 

layer. On the contrary, these reactions are concentrated in a reactive region that is thinner than 

the anode (or cathode) total thickness
[ 100, 101]

, closer to the electrolyte side. This region (of the 



Chapter 2 ? Preliminaries on The Physical Chemistry of SOFCs 67 
 

order of 10-30   ) is called the active layer of electrode (see Fig. 2.9), wherein large portion of 

the ionic current (   ) is exchanged to electronic current (  ). As will be examined in detail in 

§§4.3.1 (and also in APENDIX A), a simplified mathematical model of gas-diffusion electrodes 

can be developed to investigate the qualitative effects of mass-transport limitations on the 

polarization characteristics within this active layer zone (see Fig. 2.10), when one considers 

the “limiting situations” of ideal ionic transport or ideal mass transport of feed-gas. 

 
Figure 2.9: three-dimensional (simulated) current streamline distributions in a anode (      ) microstructure. 
Red color and blue color represent, respectively, ionic and electronic currents (figure reproduced from [ 102]). 

 

Considering the example of an anode according to Fig. 2.10, oxide ions come from the 

electrolyte (left side), whereas gas molecules arrive from the anode outer layer (right side). 

The conversion reaction consumes neutral gas molecules, and produces currents of electrons 

and oxide ions. The feed gas concentration (   ) decreases towards the electrolyte, whereas 

the electronic current (  ) grows and ionic current (   ) decays with the distance from electrolyte 

interface. The conversion is assumed to occur in an idealized slab (active layer) of thickness 

  : on the right side of this slab,     is zero and    reaches the value of the total cell current 

density ( ); accordingly,   is equal to     at the electrolyte interface. The driving force for 

electrochemical conversion is, in this case, provided by the local “augmented” polarization 

      ; the voltage required to completely convert  , from ionic into electronic form, is   . The 

cell polarization curve of this active layer is then given by          .

concentration (   ), local augmented polarization ( ), overall cell polarization (  ), and the cell current 

density ( ). (figure by the author). 

 

As will be seen in §§4.3, §§4.4, and §§4.5, when the modeling study disregards the 

details of what happens within the active layer (a simplification that is frequently applied in the 

literature), this layer is approximated by an effective zero-thickness model and, in this case,  

proper boundary conditions are prescribed. In practical terms, this means that there is the 

assumption of a zero-dimensional surface reaction and thus the layer is treated as an idealized 

zero-thickness surface, which has mass sources/sinks term coupled to the neighboring 

electrode phase. Be that as it may, this reduced model does the same job of current-to-current 

conversion, “encapsulating” the description of electrochemical reactions. Whichever model is 

used, the judgment for the spatial limits of an active layer is essentially arbitrary without the 

availability of experimental data on local parameters and/or properties. 

It is worthwhile to clarify that there are “imprecisions”
9
 in the way in that polarization is 

loosely defined in several works from the SOFC literature, leaving unclear the exact definitions 

of activation polarization, concentration (diffusional) polarization, and “total” polarization. The 

strict definition of a polarization depends on the chosen electric potential reference and on the 

attribution of an equilibrium cell potential
[ 67]

. Furthermore, there is an apparent indifference 

(mainly in terms of nomenclature) between local polarization and “total” polarization, where the 

latter could be the total (integrated) activation polarization or the sum of diffusional and 

activation polarizations (i.e., “augmented polarization”). For these reasons, a number of 

explanations are included in the present monograph (especially in section §§2.3). This 

addendum proves necessary to conceptual consistency of further developments (It is fair to 

                                                      
9
 Here it is best to use the term “imprecision”, because the definition of different types of polarizations is usually 

done at the discretion of the researcher. Thus, for one to coin such careless treatment as “an error” would be, 
strictly speaking, exaggerated. On the other hand, however, the application of “carel ess definitions” can indeed 
constitute potential sources of errors in subsequent mathematical derivations (see Chapter 4).

say that the correction of a “flawed assertion” often requires more space than is taken up in 

setting forth the incorrectness). Ultimately, such addendum also allows one to bring up aspects 

that are rarely vetted in the SOFC modeling literature, such as the careless definition of 

“activation polarization” and “augmented polarization” and how their misleading definitions 

might affect the modeling of transport phenomena within the gas phase and the ensuing 

effects on cell performance (e.g., concentration-induced voltage losses). 

Being acute on certain electrochemical concepts allows one to stress awareness of the 

limits of models herein studied and developed. However, electrochemical modeling 

assumptions and their limitations are not thoroughly scrutinized in this work. The objective 

herein is solely to clarify immediate inconsistencies that could compromise the fullest 

comprehension of a given mathematical model in the next chapters of this work, which are 

pertinent to the modeling of gas-phase transport processes. 

At first glance, and without imposing any prior assumption concerning the concrete 

case under study, electrochemical reaction rates are not evenly distributed within the active 

layer of an electrode
[ 67]

. In fact, in the absence of non-ohmic polarization (that is, when       is 

independent of       and of reacting species concentration), the reaction occurs only at the 

boundaries of the active layer and, to minimize the ohmic potential drop, the total current 

density ( ) tends to immediately divide between the ionic phase (   ) and electronic (  ) phase 

in proportion to their effective conductivities
[ 67]

. This would require, first, that extremely high 

reaction rates exist near the interfaces     and/or      (see Fig. 2.10), thereby leading to 

the aforementioned nonuniform reaction distribution, as described in the above paragraphs 

and which seems to be the ordinary situation in SOFCs. Thus, in this limiting case, the reaction 

rate at the electronic-ionic interface would be proportional to            ?  and the current 

entering the composite electrode would immediately distribute itself between both phases, so 

that in each phase the ohmic drop is the same. On the other hand, slow electrode reaction 

kinetics “forces” the reaction to be more uniformly distributed so to reduce the local transfer 

current (  
 ). In this sense, the effect of activation polarization is to distribute the reaction more 

uniformly through the electrode. For instance, if reactive TPBs are sparsely distributed along 

the composite electrode, instead of being concentrated near the boundaries, then electrons 

will have a wider distribution of percolating paths. As a result, the ionic current would also need 

to diffuse farther from the electrolyte to the current collector side, through a less conductive 

(“longer”)     network, thus increasing ohmic losses. These competing effects of ohmic 

potential drop and slow reaction kinetics determine the resulting distribution. Figure 2.11 

shows an idealized equivalent circuit of the composite electrode illustrating the current flowing

through the ionic and electronic resistances, and the current transfer from one phase to the 

other (i.e., electrochemical reaction).

modified from [ 67]). 

 

For the problem in the active layer, specifically, five dimensionless ratios govern the 

current distribution
[ 103]

. These can be stated as: a dimensionless current density (   ); a 

dimensionless exchange current density (   ); the ratio     ?  of the transfer coefficients in the 

BVE; the ratio      ?  of the effective conductivities of the ionic and electronic phases; and an 

additional dimensionless parameter (  ) that indicates the effect of mass transport of the 

reacting molecular species on the steady-state reaction distribution (i.e., the magnitude of the 

electrochemical consumption rate relative to the mass-transfer rate).

where   
  is a “reference” exchange current density (see §§2.3.4 for its precise definition);   is 

a reference (or scaling) gas diffusion coefficient of the gas mixture; and      is a reference (or 

scaling) molar gas concentration. The other parameters are as described in previous pages. 

Therefore, the current and reaction distributions along the depth of the electrode may 

be described through use of these dimensionless parameters, indicating that distributions are 

influenced by the type of activation polarization, by mass transport of the reacting species, and 

finally by the effective conductivities of the two phases (ionic and electronic). Furthermore, the 

distance to which the reaction can penetrate the composite electrode determines how thick an

electrode can be effectively utilized (i.e., it determines the thickness of active layer).  Thus, 

electrodes much thicker than this penetration depth are not fully utilized.  

In the absence of concentration effects, the nonuniformity of reaction distribution is 

determined by the parameters     and    
 
 
[ 67]

. They express the ratios of the competing effects 

of ohmic losses and slow electrodes kinetics. For small values of either     and    
 
, the reaction 

is uniform (see Fig 2.12). For large values of either     and    
 
, the ohmic effect dominates and 

the reaction distribution is mostly nouniform (reaction occurs mainly at the active 

layer/electrolyte interface). The appearance of the ratio     ?  inside these parameters is a 

direct consequence of applying the Butler–Volmer formalism, but its role is difficult to discern. 

For small values of      ? , reaction occurs preferentially near the active layer/electrolyte 

boundary at the expense of the region near the outer electrode layer (see Fig. 2.12). This ratio 

     ?  serves to shift the reaction from one boundary to the other so that the reaction is 

somewhat more uniform as     approaches   , at constant     (see figures 2.12 and 2.13). If 

both conductivities are non-zero, the ohmic contribution to the voltage drop will eventually 

dominate at high current values. If one phase has a much higher conductivity in comparison to 

the other, a double Tafel slope results

In the study developed by Newman and Tobias
[ 103]

, the parameter     was used for the 

Tafel regime or conversion domain (high polarization). These authors have shown that at high 

current levels (with Tafel kinetics),      ?  is the length that is more characteristic of the 

penetration of the reaction, and that the reaction distribution is independent of the exchange 

current density   . However, in the limit approached at low current densities, the nonuniformity 

of the reaction increases with increasing values of the parameter    
 
. Within the Tafel range, 

the authors also found that the relationship between these parameters of nonuniformity could 

be expressed as

Thus, for uniform concentration, Eq. (2.117) tells us that the reaction distribution becomes less 

uniform as one increases the: (i) magnitude of the current density; (ii) the thickness of the 

active layer; or (iii) the sum of the effective resistivities of the two phases. In any case, the 

point of most even distribution will not occur at zero current density unless         ?

In the case when there are meaningful concentration gradients of reacting species, the

layer/outer layer interface as a result of hindered movement of the incoming species (see 

§§4.3.1). When the diffusive transport of reactants/products controls the overall rate of 

electrochemical conversion, other factors will determine the “useful” thickness of the active 

layer. For instance, for large anodic polarizations, the penetration depth becomes equal to 

     ?  (see Eq. (2.113)). However, if mass transfer, as well as the ohmic losses and the 

electrode kinetics have similar importance, then the overall rate of conversion will be a function 

of all involved penetration depths, Eq. (2.113) and (2.115). For example, this problem could be 

described by the following equations
[ 103]

, which somewhat combine these dimensionless 

penetration depths: 

      
    

  
     
   

(            
       

   
)    

(2.118) 
     

   
              

 

where in Eq. (2.118), specifically, 

     
   
 
      

    

      
 (2.119) 

 

and     is the Tafel slope, which is defined as 

    
   

   
   with         (2.120) 

 

The reaction penetration depth may be “measured” as either the thickness of the reaction zone 

near electrolyte interface, or as the thickness of the reaction zone starting near the outer-layer 

interface. Thus,    depends on which interface is taken as a reference and on the physics of 

the problem considered (e.g., diffusion-limited or conduction-limited). 

Finally, to end this section, attention is driven to one of the more commonly implied 

assumptions in the SOFC literature, which considers the electronic phase of the composite 

electrode as a perfect conductor.  Consequentially, for domain interior points one has 

      ?    

(2.121) 
  ?  ?    (

 

   
 

 

  
) ?

 

   
 

 

and recognizing that      remains a finite value. Such assumption is easily seen by comparing 

Eq. (2.114) with the following relation used in Kulikovsky’s model (examined in §§4.3.1):

And taking into account the simplification proposed by Eq. (2.121). This assumption is 

equivalent to that made on the derivation of Eq. (2.92) and (2.93) in §§2.3.2.  



Chapter 2 ? Preliminaries on The Physical Chemistry of SOFCs 74 
 

As noted in §§2.3.2, in typical high-temperature SOFCs the electrolyte-phase 

conductivity is several orders of magnitude lower than the electrode-phase conductivity
10

. 

Thus, the condition given by Eq. (2.121) can be considered a very good approximation in 

macroscopic modeling (from Fig. 2.13b one verifies that when      ?      (and       ) the 

actual variation of the reaction rate profile is minimal). This is surely true for the bulk value of 

the conductivity, but one should acknowledge that the effective value of the electronic 

conductivity also depends on the microstructure features of the electron-conducting phase, 

howsoever large this bulk value may. These features might include the existence of internal 

contact resistances (e.g., heterogeneous grain boundaries) and the predominance of a poorly 

percolated conducting phase. 

In any event, modern SOFC electrodes are sufficiently well designed to avoid low 

electronic conductivities due to inadequate microstructure features
[ 8]

. However, during the 

course of SOFC life-time the composite electrode can suffer some form of microstructural 

degradation stemming from, for example, coarsening processes
[ 105, 106]

, but this possibility will 

not discussed in this work. 

 

 

Here the focus is on the definition of  ,   
 , and   (consequentially, also of     and   ). As 

will be found out, not only the clarification of these definitions is itself relevant, but rigorous 

definitions might as well identify problematic and undisclosed assumptions. The definition of   

is in the lines of what has been discussed in §§2.2.2 (see Eq. (2.28)-(2.38)). 

The form of the phenomenological BVE presents itself in several variations, whose 

number and type of parameters varies considerably (and somewhat inconsistently) in the 

literature. Compare, for instance, Eq. (2.109) with the following equation that is used in 

Kulikovsky’s model (see §§4.3.1) and which expresses the decay of ionic current with  , at a 

rate given by Butler–Volmer electrode kinetics (RHS of the equation): 

       

  
    

  (       ? )
 
[        ?            ?  ]       

  (       ? )
 
         ?   (2.123) 

 

 In Eq. (2.109) the concentration of reactants and products multiply each exponential factor 

separately, while in (2.123) only the reactant concentration is used, which multiplies both 

exponentials indistinctively. Thus, one may conclude that these equations are not directly 

comparable, even though both forms might be applied to model “the same problem”. For that

. 



Chapter 2 ? Preliminaries on The Physical Chemistry of SOFCs 75 
 

their parameters would need to be adjusted accordingly. In relation to Eq. (2.123), when it is 

said that the exponent “ ” is the reaction order in respect to the feed gas, one must stress 

awareness about this statement. That is, this exponent is really a phenomenological parameter 

that does not necessarily have a formal kinetic meaning. It is, in the case of Eq. (2.123), a 

pseudo reaction order that “blends” the effects of both forward and reverse reactions. After 

having acknowledged this distinction, some comparisons are now put forth. Let     (e.g., 

measured as             ) be the electrochemical reaction rate expressed by 

     
  
 

    
 

  
 

    
[        ?            ?  ]      

  [        ?            ?  ] (2.124) 

 

where   
  (A     ) is a volumetric exchange current density and    ( 

  ) is a reaction rate 

constant, which is independent of species concentration. From the equation above, 

  
           

    (2.125) 

 

Comparing this result with Eq. (2.123), one verifies that 

  
    

   (     ? )
  

             
   (2.126) 

 

Meaning that   
   is an exchange current density evaluated at the concentration     , which is 

thus not an arbitrary reference. Otherwise, the exponent “ ” becomes only an experimentally-

fitted parameter, which convey little or no physical meaning, just to satisfy Eq. (2.124). 

In §§2.3.1 and §§2.3.2 it has been pointed out that the activation polarization      is 

function of the gas-phase composition (see Eq. (2.40), (2.41), (2.64), and (2.65)), but 

Kulikovsky and some other authors do not usually emphasize this point. The issue lies in what 

is the correct definition of “ ” for what form of BVE. If an implicit approach is used, as per Eq. 

(2.35)-(2.39), the definition and hence the evaluation of      depends on     
   

, which is by its 

turn a function of the local gas composition and it accounts for local potential changes induced 

by local concentration effects. However, depending upon a different definition of “ ” it can, 

however, also include effects due to non-local concentration losses, fact that could generate 

discrepancies if the modeling is not properly handled (see Chapter 3). Amongst the different 

polarizations (“ ”) that are employed inside the exponentials terms of BVE, here follows the 

most common
[ 67]

: 

? The activation polarization “    ”, which is defined as 

            
   

                 
   

  (2.127) 
 

With      evaluated at the local (TPB) gas composition.

? And the “total” or augmented polarization “ ”, which is defined as

gas conditions”).  

 

In Eq. (2.127),     
   

 is the open-circuit value of             at the prevailing gas 

composition on the surface of the pores (at TPBs). In Eq. (2.128),     
   

 is the open-circuit 

value of             when the concentrations of the reactant and product are given at the 

some reference condition. Thus, in both these equations      is the value of the potential 

difference between the electrode and electrolyte at which the rate of the forward reaction 

equals the rate of the reverse reaction. In this situation, the net rate of reaction calculated by 

the BVE must be zero in a given phase (e.g.,        ). Therefore, as will be made clear 

further below, the definition of “ ” is inherently related to the specific form of BVE.

conveniently be taken to be the initial concentration of the reactant/product or the 

concentration prevailing external to the active layer. It does not mandatorily refer to the “bulk 

gas condition”. Usage of

convenience. In Eq. (2.131), the exchange current density can be shown to be given by

In the derivation of Eq. (2.133), it was assumed that the cathodic and anodic reactions are first 

order with respect to reactants, although generalization to an arbitrary order is straightforward.  

The equation above can be easily obtained if one substitutes Eq. (2.127), (2.130), and 

(2.134) in Eq. (2.131). In this latter equation, the local open-circuit voltage

Which is exactly the “primitive form” of the BVE, c.f., Eq.(2.130). Thus, one sees that both Eq. 

(2.131) and (2.132) are equivalent, despite their differences in form (in respect to “    ” or “ ”). 

In Kulikovsky’s model (see §§4.3.2), the following equation states that Ohm's law 

should be valid for the electrolyte phase, relating the ionic current to the overvoltage gradient: 

         
     

  
 (2.140) 

 

In the case where        in (2.140), Kulikovsky’s model does not hold unless: 

i. If one neglects the ohmic losses in the electronic phase and thus if it is assumed 

that the phase potential       is a constant (see §§2.3.2 and §§2.3.3). 
 

ii. And if      is also assumed constant (it has already been seen that, rigorously 

speaking, this potential difference varies along the thickness of the active layer if 

the chemical activity of reacting species is allowed to vary). 
 

That is, from Eq. (2.88), (2.92), (2.93), and (2.127) 

     
  

 
                   

  
  

      

  
 

   
   

     
      

  
         

    
  

   (2.141) 

 

It is true that if the gas composition varies along the thickness of the active layer,     

will also change, invalidating the physical pertinence of Eq.(2.140), in the case where       . 

Furthermore, we note that in Eq. (2.140)   is switched in sign in comparison to Eq. (2.141). 

This is because the sign of the current flux (which is oriented the opposite way to the electron 

flux) must be physically consistent with the adopted reference frame (e.g., orientation of 

coordinate axes). For example, in the anodic half-cell the current vector is directed from the 

anode outer layer toward the electrolyte. If this vector is not pointing in the positive direction of 

the coordinate axis, the current density (electronic and ionic) will be negative -valued. As a 

matter of convenience, it appears that Kulikovsky chose to consider only positive values for 

both polarization and current densities, irrespective of which half-cell (anodic or cathodic) is 

modeled.  



Chapter 2 ? Preliminaries on The Physical Chemistry of SOFCs 79 
 

To put it concisely, it is not clear whether “ ” refers to the activation polarization, 

Eq.(2.127), or to the total polarization, Eq. (2.128), in Kulikovsky model. More likely it is the 

latter situation, that is, Kulikovsky is modeling the “augmented polarization” and not the 

activation polarization profiles. Only in the case of ideal gas-phase transport is when“ ” 

reduces to “    ”. Moreover, If “   is the augmented polarization then Eq. (2.123) is not 

rigorously correct because, as has already been pointed out previously, the reactant 

concentration multiplies both the forward and reverse reaction rates. This suggests, in 

principle, that the feed reactant would have the same stoichiometric coefficient in both sides of 

the chemical reaction equation. In other words, one arrives at the paradoxical conclusion that 

in this case the feed gas is neither a reactant nor a product! Nonetheless, the value   
  still 

follows the expected physics in that the exchange current density increases if either the 

reactant or product concentration is increased (see Eq. (2.126) and (2.137)). That is, an 

increase of either reactant or product concentration should shift the equilibrium potential such 

that both the forward and reverse reaction rates remain equal. 

By way of example, if      was to be used in place of  , then one should reformulate the 

system of equations (2.123) and (2.140) as: 

    
  

      
              ?   (2.142)

) (2.143) 

 

Where          (   ), according to Eq. (2.64) or (2.65).  

A final remark, but not an unimportant one, concerns the distinctiveness between local, 

augmented, and integral values of polarization, so that we are sure about what one is exacly 

referring to. Staring with Eq. (2.127) and differentiating it with respect to  :

gradients, within the thin segment       of the active layer thickness; similarly,

potential changes induced by concentration effects within the thin segment      . If we

What is interesting about Eq. (2.145)-(2.152) is that these equations portray the cell 

polarization from the perspective of the “ohmic expenditure” in the ionic phase of a composite 

electrode. In this fashion, although the electrode overvoltage   does not represent a physical 

electric potential difference (see §§2.3.1), it can conveniently be represented by the ohmic loss 

contributions of the different components of electrode. Another interesting result is the negative 

sign in front of the term associated with electronic ohmic losses in Eq. (2.145) and (2.150). It 

suggests that by decreasing the electronic conductivity in comparison to the ionic conductivity, 

the average electrochemical reaction rate (e.g.,    ? ?        ) will increase accordingly. 

However, this will also smooth out the reaction rate profile along the electrode thickness (see 

figures 2.12 and 2.13), fact that might require a thicker active layer, thereby increasing the 



Chapter 2 ? Preliminaries on The Physical Chemistry of SOFCs 81 
 

overall ohmic loss. Thus, once more, one verifies the existing compromise between ohmic 

losses and reaction rates, as discussed in §§2.3.3. 

In one of his models (see APPENDIX A) concerning the case of ideal ionic transport
11

, 

Kulikovsky
[ 12, 107]

 has made the inconsistent assumption of a vanishing small overvoltage 

gradient (    ), based on the use of an augmented polarization setup. From Eq. (2.151) one 

finds that the augmented polarization   is also function of the concentration polarization       

and for that it is not possible to readily assume that     ,   . The concentration polarization 

can attain sufficient importance to such extent that the overvoltage gradient will vary along the 

active layer thickness. As a result of this undue assumption, the model developed by 

Kulikovsky in §§A.2 is restricted to only low current density values, where concentration 

polarization processes are not expected to occur in an important manner. That is, by assuming 

     the author also (unduly) restricts the concentration polarization to relatively small 

values (       ). 

                                                      
11

 Thus a case wherein mass transport limitations in the gas-phase are taken into consideration (and thus so are 
concentration polarizations) and the ionic transport is, on the other hand, disregarded completely.

Under real operating conditions, SOFC chemical and electrochemical reactions can 

only proceed at a limited rate. Moreover, the empirical situation is that, with a few exceptions 

involving extraordinary (idealized) conditions, reactions will proceed slowly. The rate at which 

these reactions can occur will depend on the interplay of multiscale physicochemical 

processes, which all together are deeply influenced by the micromorphology details of SOFC 

functional layers. Thus, a practical issue of central importance is to identify and describe, 

intelligibly, what limits SOFC reaction rates. This surely is, and has been, an enormous 

scientific challenge
[ 6, 7, 13, 8]

. 

As described in §§1.3.2, to generate electricity, the SOFC must be continuously 

supplied with fuel and oxidant to avoid fuel cell “starvation”. Concurrently, products must be 

continuously removed as to avoid “strangling” the SOFC. This overall process of supplying 

reactants and removing products is what constitutes the seeming, macroscopic essence of fuel 

cell mass transport
1
. As it will be discussed in more detail, poor mass transfer can lead to 

substantial performance loss, which is often termed as “concentration-induced losses” of a 

SOFC electrode. This loss is, ultimately, the result of some adverse density distribution of 

reactants and products over the active area of electrocatalysts. The gas-phase chemical 

potential gradient provides one of the main, but not the only, “thermodynamic forces” driving 

the diffusive transport of reactants and products, to and from the reaction zones, respectively. 

This spatial difference in chemical potential develops, to a great extent, as the result of

 The focus of this work is on gas-phase phenomena. However, there is also the solid-phase ionic transport of 

oxygen ions (in the electrolyte and also in ionic conducting phases of composite electrodes).  Ionic transport is 
actually a subset of mass transport where the mass being transported consists of charged ions

heterogeneous reactions (species consumption/production) occurring within the buffer-layer 

and electrode active layers (see figures 1.15 and 3.1). Thus, one can perceive a delicate and 

yet dynamic balance between material fluxes and driving forces that might lead to reactant 

depletion, or product accumulation, in the reaction zones, affecting the SOFC performance. 

Furthermore, as there is a strong interdependence between mass transport and surface-

catalyzed reactions, which involves the active (transition-metal) catalyst, one should also take 

into consideration the feedback of chemical reactions in response to the local (spatial varying) 

properties of the catalytic substrate, along the interface between the pore-wall and fluid-layer.

processes: (1) reactant delivery (transport) into the SOFC; (2) fuel reforming reactions; (3) electrochemical 
reactions; (4) ionic or electronic conduction (charge transport); (5) removal of product and/or reactant excess from 
SOFC (figure by the author).  
 

The definition of concentration polarization, as ordinarily found in the literature, was 

given in §§2.2.2 and expressed by Eq. (2.37) and (2.38) for the anode and cathode, 

respectively. Now, that definition should be expanded through the incorporation of 

complementary concepts. First and foremost, it will be pointed out that “mass transport loss” 

should not to be (always) taken as equivalent of “concentration polarization”. SOFC mass 

transport losses encompass more than the sole effect of chemical potential gradients in gas-

phase. These losses can reflect the combination of direct and indirect (cross) effects arising 

from competing transport phenomena, especially those cross-effects between individual 

irreversible processes, whose impact usually lessens the velocity of electrochemical reactions 

and that is rarely obvious under a superficial examination of the problem. The discussion to 

follow is restricted to the domain of steady state processes. The analysis of models with 

respect to their shortcomings, misconceptions, and inaccuracies is not pursed at this point, a 

task which is fulfilled in the next chapter wherein chosen models are critically reviewed.

When electroactive chemical species (i.e., species that directly participate in the course 

of electrochemical reactions) are present at different concentrations (activities), a voltage 

difference develops
[ 67]

. This voltage “build-up” portrays the fact that electrochemical potentials 

are offsetting one another to maintain the thermodynamic equilibrium (i.e., zero net reaction 

rate and balanced electric charges at electroactive sites). More precisely, equilibrium is 

established when an electrical potential gradient builds up sufficiently to exactly 

counterbalance the chemical potential gradient: 

(?     ? 
 

)
        

   (?     ? 
 

)
         

   (3.1) 

 

From which Eq. (2.43) was previously derived, also using the definition of electrochemical 

potential, Eq. (2.42). As mentioned in §§2.3.1,      represents the “built-up electrical potential” 

for the charges that are moved on the reaction sites, per-mole basis of a given reactant. Thus, 

one could say that the chemical potential difference between the bulk gas and the gas 

effectively contacting electrochemical reaction sites forms a concentration cell
[ 109]

, whose cell 

voltage would oppose the overall SOFC’s EMF and which may be seen as a voltage loss 

(polarization).  From Eq. (2.43) follows that (see §§3.3.1 for the exact expressions on cathode 

and anode sides):

be either positive 
or negative. 

 

          
    

     
   

   (      
           

   
) (3.3) 

 

The application of these expressions only makes sense if the reversible voltage (    ) 

is evaluated by taking a certain reference for the concentration of electroactive species, in this 

case the bulk gas concentration (    
    ). The concentration polarization      , which is 

discounted from     
    , may be seen as the “voltage surplus” that would be available if the 

concentration of electroactive species at the TPB was the same as that in the bulk flow. The 

polarization defined by Eq. (3.3) is also known as Nernstian loss, because the effects of gas 

concentration on reversible cell voltage are modeled by the Nernst equation. Considering the 

case of a hydrogen/oxygen SOFC, Eq. (3.2) can be shown to give Eq. Eq. (2.37) and (2.38), 

as will be seen in  §§3.3.1. 



Chapter 3 ? Mass Transfer Limitations and Concentration Losses 85 
 

Without delving into the intricate details of convective and diffusive “forces”, which are 

often interwoven with other driving forces, the intent here is to first establish a conceptual 

interpretation for the relation between reactants and products transport, and the concentration 

polarization (     ). Therefore, it will be of no relevance in what follows to bring forth a 

discussion about “everything” that might affect such transport. At this point, it is assumed that 

transport is essentially diffusive and that electrochemical reactions are solely responsible for 

driving the diffusion of gas-phase species.  

In the example of a hydrogen/oxygen fuel cell (see Fig. 3.2), the depletion of    in the 

vicinity of the TPB extends out into the anode, because the diffusive transport of   , from the 

bulk flow to the reaction zones, has a finite rate. In this example, therefore, the concentration 

gradient constitutes the essential driving force for the mass transport process through this 

electrode. The concentration of    in the gas phase falls from its bulk value (        ) at the 

flow channel to a lower value (           ) at the anode/electrolyte interface. Here it is assumed 

to be possible to define a stagnant gas region (“diffusion layer”) with diffusion-dominated 

transport. Although the delimitation of such region is unrealistic or, at most, hardly defined, it 

introduces an important characterization parameter: the diffusion layer thickness (     ).  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 3.2: simplified mass transport problem in the anode of a SOFC. A perfect mixing of reactants and products 

in the bulk flow (gas channel) is assumed, and thus an invariant bulk concentration (         and          ). 

Electroactive species are consumed/generated within the active layer, potentially leading to reactant depletion 
or/and product accumulation. As a result, concentration gradients are established along the diffusion layer (figure 
by the author).

This thickness serves to line off hypothetical “boundary lines” between convection -

dominated and diffusion-dominated regions, where the gas channel and porous electrode 

meet at one of the boundaries. The diffusion layer thickness, being itself an abstraction, does 

not coincide, necessarily, with the electrode thickness.  In other words, the diffusion layer 

thickness should be taken as a pseudo-geometric parameter. In the oversimplified situation 

depicted in Fig. 3.2, the reactant depletion (or product accumulation) can affect SOFC 

performance through the combination of two “loss effects”, namely “Nernstian losses” and 

“concentration-induced kinetic losses”. The collective effect of these losses is what the 

literature generally refers to as the SOFC mass transport losses. As already advised in the 

preceding paragraphs, the mass transport loss revels itself far more complex than this 

prevailing view wherein the loss is only associated with the difference between TPB and bulk 

concentrations of reactants and products (see §§3.6). 

 

 

 

The electric potential difference (  ) of the “virtual” concentration cell that forms on the 

anode or cathode can be evaluated by assuming that the respective electrochemical 

potentials, at either “bulk conditions” or “three-phase-boundary conditions”, are offsetting one 

another to maintain the thermodynamic equilibrium. Appling Eq. (2.42) and (2.43) for reaction 

(2.44), at both “bulk gas” and TPB conditions, then

In Eq. (3.6) it was assumed that both the activity (   
  ) of oxide ions, on/near the solid 

electrolyte surface, are not affected by the chemical activity of adjacent gas-phase species, 

that is,    
          

     . The activity of conducting electrons in metals is assumed to be “1”, 

as is the activity of pure components, hence these terms vanish from the equations.  In Eq. 

(3.7), it was also used the result of Eq. (2.61). The development for the cathode of an SOFC 

has an analogous procedure, but considers the reaction given by (2.46) instead:

Note that the sign (i.e., polarity) of Eq. (3.8) and (3.13) depends on the direction of the 

electrochemical reactions considered (Eq. (2.44) and (2.46), respectively). Thus, the sign 

associated with electric potentials (and polarizations) is not completely arbitrary. Attention is 

much needed in setting up the calculation of electromotive “forces” and electric p otential 

differences (see §§2.3.1), so that thermodynamic consistency is not compromised. Ad hoc 

absolute values are widely applied in the literature to “work around” this issue.  

In respect to the cathode, Eq. (3.9) and (3.10) indicate that the concentration 

polarization could either increase or decrease, depending on whether the activity of oxide ions 

is affected by the activity of    near the gas/solid interface, according to Eq. (3.14):

The assumption  
  

 
      

  
 

   
 was initially enforced to make possible the derivations above. To 

verify this, one needs to know how the differences of potential step and activity relate to 

changes in the contact chemistry and space charge zone near the interface
[ 87, 110, 111]

. Now, 

when analyzing both concentration polarizations in conjunction (anodic plus cathodic

(3.16) 

 

In Eq. (3.15), when in thermodynamic equilibrium (i.e., zero net current density), each of the 

last two terms in square brackets must vanish and     
        

   
. However, for finite values of 

current density this is not necessarily true (see comments at the end of §§2.3.1). Nevertheless, 

one might argue that the overall contribution of these last two terms, i.e.  (   
       

     ), 

should be very small even under non-equilibrium conditions if the ratio    
       

      is 

approximately linear with respect to current density, albeit the possibility of anodic and 

cathodic oxide-ions contributions not being negligible if evaluated separately, as in the 

cathodic case of Eq. (3.14). 

For simplicity, one can show that when the electric potential variation in the ionic phase 

(    
 ) is approximately equal to the ohmic voltage loss (    ), the respective variation of 

chemical activity (   
 ) is approximately zero. In order to do so, one starts with the Nernst-

Einstein equation

And both Eq. (3.7) and (3.12) are equally verified in a more general case. Thus, one finds that 

the chemical activity of (bulk interstitial) oxide-ions does not influence the value of 

concentration polarization (more precisely, the value of Nernstian polarization) at the limit 

when the electric potential difference within the phases is due only to ohmic effects.

In certain situations common to SOFC operation at steady state, the dependence of 

   
     on the oxygen partial pressure     becomes relatively unimportant for              

[ 

111, 75, 112, 113]
, even though the electrode kinetics itself (e.g., the exchange current density) is 

still significantly affected by     (see §§3.5).  Nevertheless, one might question what would be 

the indirect effect (if any) of surface ad-ions on the evaluation of concentration polarization due 

to changes on the oxygen partial pressure near to that surface.  Here one is not interested in 

how to rigorously correct for interfacial and other polarization effects, neither does one 

consider the complicated double-layer transients taking place near the solid-solid interfaces, 

however. As seen in §§3.3.1, a simpler description can be obtained for small to moderate 

current densities when electrode’s bulk composition should not be affected and the stationary 

current density is readily given by the electric field (ohmic) term alone of the electrochemical 

potential. Thus, a closed definition of concentration polarization
2
 does not seem to pose a 

significant problem in this case.  

In the following, it is assumed for simplicity that the ionic conductivity is solely due to 

oxygen-ions. Moreover, it is considered a conductivity that is averaged over all oxygen-ions 

(both immobile and rapid defect particles
[ 87]

). Let the following mean-field reactions describe 

the “overall” oxygen reduction reaction (akin to rate-limiting steps) at TPB regions: 

 

 
   (         )    

 (            )     
   (            )  (3.23a) 

 

   
   (            )     (                 )   

   (                 )     (            )  (3.23b) 

 

And denoting “   (            )” as “    
  ”; “   (                 )” as “    

  ”; “   
   (            )” 

as      
 ; and “    (                 )” as “    

 ”, Eq. (3.23a) and (3.23b) can be rewritten as 

 

 
      

      
  (   )  (3.24a)

   (       )

One may further assume the oxygen vacancy defects to be equilibrated at all times, that is, it is 

assumed that the rate of transport of these defects from position         to the neighboring

Figure 3.3: schematic representation of a grain boundary (interface) at which the symmetry of the bulk is broken 

due to the introduction of structural discontinuity. Near this interface region there is  an electric field acting on the 

surrounding bulk material, which is determined by both the charges congregated at the interface and by the 

spatial extent of the charge redistribution layer (“space charge layer”). This figure also illustrates the bending of 

thermodynamic potentials for oxide ions and which define the boundary equilibrium (note that electric potentials 

cause  ?
  

 
 

 to bend in the space charge zone and to shift in the core in order to satisfy the condition  ?       ). In 

this figure, for simplicity sake, electric bulk potentials (  ) are set to zero and the shape of  ( ) near the interface 

is suggested by the solution of the linearized Poisson–Boltzmann equation

 (at the low potential limit). The 

thickness of the grain boundary is the thickness of the grain boundary core,      , in addition to the thickness of 

the two space charge regions,    .  Thus it is given by               . (figure by The author).

For illustration purposes, one can express     (potential difference between the electronic

parallel capacitor, wherein the ratio “number of charges / capacitance” gives the potential 

difference (voltage) of that capacitor (“the stored electrical charge”). Therefore, for oxide-ions 

as the main     determining species, the surface coverage for the oxygen reduction       

        
   can be now calculated (at equilibrium) as 

    
    ?             [

following a Langmuir-type dissociative adsorption kinetics, i.e.     
  (      

  )?  ?   , which 

is commonly used when site restriction plays a role
3
. If, however, one now considers

by

3
 Also note that in Eq. (3.27) there is no species representing the equivalent to a “an open site” species, which 

would lead to the additional factor       
   in the expression for the adsorption isotherm

Differently from what is proposed by Eq. (3.40), the assumption made by standard 

literature relationships for         , which disregards the effect of double-layer’s potential step, 

is reasonable as long as neutral surface species are the only considered species. This is 

because charged oxygen species such as    
   experience an additional energy contribution 

due to the electrostatic surface potential step
[ 111]

. Nevertheless, if the presence of    
   is 

predominately small, the corresponding potential step     is small as well. In this case, 

electrostatics plays a minor role and    
   behaves almost like an uncharged particle. 

Furthermore, if the surface coverage hardly exceeds 10–20%, the assumption of site 

restrictiveness for    
   can be neglected (i.e., assuming a Langmuir dissociative adsorption 

kinetics
[ 33]

 is not justified in this case).

important, the

unimportant. That is, the results predicted by Eq. (3.38) and Eq. (3.40) tend to collapse. On the

Estimating reasonable values for (   )    is not a straightforward task, because the 

prescription of values to the phenomenological parameters     and     is not without 

difficulties, due to the macroscopic degeneracy

119, 120]), but these cannot be rigorously and directly compared to the ones appearing in Eq. 

(3.37). For example, one may choose     to lie between        
   (i.e., a representative 

value close to the conditions of vacuum permittivity
[ 111]

, admitting an arbitrary distance 

between spaced charges around    ), and a supposed maxima of

TPB region. That is, it represents just a fraction of the total surface site density       available 

over the entire electrode phase. It is a fraction because only those sites sufficiently close to the 

TPB hot spot will be considered “active” for the adsorption of charged species, which are then 

able to subsequently undergo the electrochemical reduction reaction at the TPB (see Fig. 3.5).

The Newman-type boundary condition, Eq. (3.50), represents a no-flux condition at the plane 

    , according to Fig. 3.5. The Dirichlet-type boundary condition, Eq. (3.49), represents the 

relationship between the surface potential step (   ) and surface coverage at the TPB. In 

order to calculate  
   

  
   

, either Eq. (3.38) or (3.40) can be used.  One could now solve Eq. 

(3.48)-(3.50) in order to find   , using some “penetration criterion”, such as     
  (  )     

  ? (

however, the interest here is to find a straightforward way to calculate      (   ) (to be used in 

Eq. (3.42)), thus it is best to avoid this numerical burden at this time. 

As mentioned above,    may be calculated from Eq. (3.43), but one needs to determine 

a suitable definition for   . The solution of Eq. (3.48), according to the boundary conditions Eq.

   is selected. Other chosen values are:

;               

    . Although these proposed values are expected to fall within a typical 

range for cathodes where perovskite oxides of ionic character are employed, they certainly 

convey an inordinate level of arbitrariness, which is only acceptable for the purpose of an 

illustrative exercise
6
. It should be also emphasized that in this study oxygen surface exchange 

is assumed to occur, predominately, via surface oxygen ions (i.e.,   as the dominant reaction 

species) and that    is the surface diffusion coefficient of adsorbate in the low-coverage limit. 

Using the above parameter values,     was calculated as          
            at 

conditions of              and         , for which (   )          . In Fig. 3.4, a curve 

using these parameters was indicated as "Varying (   )    - Eq. (3.40), (3.54)”. It can be 

seen that this curve presents a different behavior, where it now “intersects the other curves” 

because (   )    is no longer a fixed value, as it varies with respect to        (   ). Thus, 

when inspecting Fig. 3.4 with regard to the curve “Varying (   )    - Eq. (3.40), (3.54)” one 

finds that     
   varies from       up to       in the interval between              to 

            . If it is assumed that the overall change in the activity (   
   ) of bulk oxygen ions 

(at the vicinity of electrode/electrolyte interface) varies in the same proportion (     of 

relative variation), one obtains a concentration polarization
7
 (     ) roughly of the order of 

      . Considering a narrow interval, from              up to         , the concentration 

polarization caused by surface ad-ions would be now      . If, on the other hand, one 

selects any of the other curves represented by Eq. (3.40), with (   )    fixed down to      , 

the variation of     
   is virtually negligible (considering the same interval of oxygen partial 

pressures) and thus         when due to surface ad-ions. 

  

                                                      
5
 Here one tries to not overestimate the importance of the surface polarization effect on the adsorption process of 

oxygen ions, by “underestimating” the value of (   )   . For high values of (   )    the ascending curve     
   vs 

    becomes a plateau, i.e.      
   becomes insensible to oxygen partial pressure. The increase of (   )    implies 

a reduction of oxygen adsorption energy and thus an effective enhancement of adsorption kinetics. The relation 

    
       

  (   ), however, is the main effect under study in section.

 The level of uncertainty regarding the effective rate constant         for the desorption reaction (i.e., reverse 

reaction of   ( )       ( )     ( )) is particularly worrisome

The above conclusions are to a great extent speculative in nature, because they are 

compromised by two main limitations: firstly, the uncertainty concerning the parameter values 

that have been chosen in the study; secondly, the intrinsic limitation of a mean-field 

approximation when using a phenomenological kinetics description for nanoscale-driven 

heterogeneous catalytic processes
[ 55, 132, 133]

.  Furthermore, it is certainly difficult to conceive 

an experimental setup, or a “thought experiment” for that matter, where concentration-induced 

polarizations caused by adsorbed surface species could be actually measured or somewhat 

quantified. For instance, changes in the oxygen partial pressure can also lead to other “second 

order” voltage losses, such as those related to electronic leakage in ionic-conducting materials
[ 

8]
, whose individual effect would be troublesome to identify and measure. 

 

 

 

Nernstian losses are simply the cell voltage decrease across the electrode thickness 

(i.e., along electrode’s through-plane direction, see Fig. 3.2), which may be predicted by Eq. 

(3.3) in the situations when the reactant concentration at the TPB is decreased relative to the 

bulk concentration; and/or the product concentration at the TPB is increased relative to the 

bulk concentration. If the difference in concentration is assumed to stem from diffusion-

controlled transport, at steady state, the flux of reactants and products down the concentration 

gradients should match the consumption/production rate of reactants/products at the TPB: 

         ?   ?? (  electroactive reactant or product) (3.55) 

 

where   is the cell operating current density;     is the diffusive molar flux of a reactant towards 

the TPB (or the diffusive molar flux of a product away from the TPB); and  ? is the (normal) 

outward pointing unit vector to the electrode/electrolyte interface. Introducing a simple Fickian 

definition for the diffusion flux in the case of    (i.e., anode), Eq. (3.55)  may be written as 

          [    
      (   )]          

    
(                    )

        
 

(3.56) 

                          
          

       
   

 

 

where    
    is an effective (or rather, an experimentally representative) diffusivity for    within 

the anode porous layer. This simplified equation indicates that the reactant concentration in 

the electrode/electrolyte interface depends on  ,         , and    
   . Thus, as the value of   

increases, the reactant depletion effect is amplified. That is, the higher the current density, the 



Chapter 3 ? Mass Transfer Limitations and Concentration Losses 101 
 

worse the concentration-induced loss. Equation (3.56) also states that this concentration loss 

can be minimized if the diffusion layer thickness is reduced or the diffusivity is somehow 

increased. Analytical expressions such as Eq. (3.56), which employ physically measurable 

parameters, have been used in the SOFC literature extensively to determine anodic or 

cathodic concentration polarizations
[ 82, 134]

 (see also Chapter 4). These expressions vary 

significantly in both their form and prediction range, depending on, for instance, the number of 

parameters considered, the constitutive relation used for the diffusive flux (e.g., “Fick’s law”, 

“generalized Fick’s law”, “Maxwell-Stefan”), if the fuel and oxidant inlet gas streams were 

admitted pure or diluted with some inert gas, and so on.  

More often than not, analytical expressions that are employed to evaluate concentration 

polarization make use of an important parameter, commonly termed as the limiting current 

density (  ), to describe both anode (     ) and cathode (     ) mass transfer processes. The 

anode-limiting current density is usually defined
[ 76, 8]

 as the current density at which the 

interfacial fuel partial pressure at the anode/electrolyte interface (i.e., at TPBs) is zero (the cell 

is starved of fuel). Similarly, the cathode-limiting current density is defined as the current 

density at which the interfacial oxygen partial pressure at the cathode/electrolyte interface is 

zero (the cell is starved of oxidant). It is a material characteristic of the SOFC and provides a 

measure of the resistance to concentration polarizations (a higher    implies potentially lower 

losses). The limiting current density can be calculated from Eq. (3.56) by setting              : 

      
           

            

        
  

       
            

        
  

       
            

           
 (3.57) 

 

And similarly for the cathode: 

      
           

            

        
 

       
            

        
 

       
            

           
  (3.58) 

 

Analogous expressions can be developed to account for product accumulation effects, 

in lieu of considering only reactant depletion effects. Here, for simplicity, the above analytical 

expressions consider only depletion effects. The limiting current density represents a 

theoretical upper limit for mass transport (see Fig. 3.7), as the SOFC cannot sustain higher 

current densities than that which causes the fuel/oxidant concentration to fall to near zero at 

TPBs. Even though Fig. 3.7 seemingly suggests that the limiting current would constitute a 

“distant limit” for SOFC operation, it is important to stress that concentration losses can be 

significant even at lower current densities, contrary to what is generally acknowledged in the 

literature.

Figure 3.7: sample polarization curve showing major losses and the maximum (theoretical) current density   
(figure by the author). 

 

The concentration polarization can be expressed in terms of the limiting current density. 

Using Eq. (3.56) and (3.57), the ratio                      may be written as: 

        

           
 

(                         
    )

(                         
    )  (                     

    )
 

     
       

  (3.59) 

 

Substituting this result into Eq. (3.56) and ignoring the effect from product accumulation: 

      
   

       
   (

     
       

)  (3.60) 

 

An analogous procedure holds for the cathode as well: 

      
   

       
   (

     
       

)   (3.61) 

 

In Eq. (3.60) or (3.61), as the operating current density approaches its limiting value, that is 

when         (or        ), the term       (or      ) approaches infinity (with distinct lateral 

limits, i.e. there is a jump discontinuity). However, the maximum value of  
    

 is physically 

limited by the OCV. Thus, the maximum current density will be always less then   .  Moreover, 

other voltage losses (e.g., ohmic and activation losses) may degrade the SOFC operating 

voltage to zero, well before    is ever reached. 

Here again, expressions such as equations (3.60) and (3.61) can also vary significantly 

in both their form and prediction scope (see §§4.4). At first glance, these expressions may 

seem to dictate a general asymptotic behavior of SOFCs. However, this latter observation is 

not founded on fundamental arguments. Equations (3.60) and (3.61) are just observed 

phenomenological statements that were verified by their empirical consequences, in well -

defined experimental settings. This implies that both interpretation and use of such formulae 

are (or should be) restricted to those experimental conditions. For instance, even the 

ubiquitous assumption that             drops to zero as          is not always correct, 

sometimes leading to unphysical approximations
[ 135]

. Furthermore, up to this moment, there 

are no reliable quantitative experiments carried out to investigate the effects on correlated 

processes that occur very near this seeming stringent limit, such as space charge
[ 136]

 and 

interfacial strain effects
[ 137]

, which could also influence gas transport mechanisms. 

 

 

There is another cell operation-related effect that (sometimes) is not attributed (directly) 

to concentration polarization, but it is an effect that is nonetheless a form of concentration-

induced voltage loss. If the gas channel inlet stream is not pure fuel/oxidant, there is an 

irreversible mixing of gases along the channel’s mean flow direction, as progressively more 

fuel/oxidant is used in the chemical reactions (e.g., bulk flow gets diluted in respect to 

fuel/oxidant), causing the cell voltage to fall (see Fig. 3.8). In the case of a fuel channel, the 

leaner the mixture, the lower is the available cell voltage (see Fig. 3.9). Therefore, in real 

operating situations, the fuel can never be fully consumed in the SOFC itself and some of it 

must be left in the anode exhaust stream
[ 4, 13]

.

here represented through a simplified quasi-2D model (see also §§4.3.2 and §§4.10.2) (figure by the author) 

 

This mixing effect by fuel utilization is a critical aspect of SOFC performance, as it can 

strikingly reduce the electric power available. As this effect is an irreversible thermodynamic

process, a SOFC under the assumption of a quasi-static operation is restricted to the limiting 

case of a vanishing fuel utilization factor, that is,    ?   (where     is the ratio of the spent 

fuel to the inlet fuel). The voltage loss (reduction of     
    ) can be calculated by expressing     

as a function of the change in species concentration within gas channel (see Fig. 3.9). 

 

 

 

Figure 3.9: voltage curves showing how     
    depends on     and temperature (picture modified from [ 4]). 

 

An important behavior to consider, regarding possible voltage losses along the mean 

flow direction, is the variation of the Nernst potential for different fuels-oxidant systems as a 

function of fuel utilization    . Figure 3.10 illustrates this behavior for three fuels (  ,    , and 

     ) using Eq. (3.62) which will be described below.

As the fuel is converted to its stoichiometric products, the fuel is further diluted in the gas mixture. For these 
hypothetical SOFC systems, the oxygen in the cathode compartment was assumed not to be depleted, i.e. 
potentials have been calculated presuming no depletion of oxygen in the air mixture (picture from [ 138]).

As shown in Fig. 3.10, Nernst potentials are highest for heavier hydrocarbons, if their direct 

electrochemical oxidation
[ 140, 141, 142]

 is assumed, i.e. without the need of a prior reforming step 

for the obtainment of a hydrogen gas mixture. On the other hand, the Nernst potential for 

hydrogen is the most reduced as a function of fuel depletion. 

Based on the nomenclature proposed by Zhu and Kee proposed in [ 138, 139], one can 

express the chemical potential balance at open circuit conditions (i.e., using the Nernst 

equation) as:

 . As an alternative to using species partial pressures, the Nernst 

equation can also be represented in terms of the species molar concentrations    as:

The concentration gradients of electroactive species can also impact the kinetics of 

electrode processes

, even though this effect is seldom reckoned as a concentration

reactions, takes into consideration the concentration of these species. This effect may be

better understood by comparing the following BVEs (see also discussion in §§2.3.4), which are 

commonly used to model electrode kinetics, e.g. for the anode case: 

        [(
           

       
)

 

   (

)

 

   ( 
                

   

  
)] (3.64) 

 

        [   (
                 

  
)     (  

                 
  

)]  (3.65) 

 

Where         and          are adopted reference concentrations;        is the exchange current 

density evaluated at those reference concentrations;    and    are the anodic and cathodic 

transfer coefficients, respectively, for the hydrogen oxidation reaction on the anode side; the 

exponential parameters   and   are known experimental parameters; and      
    is the activation 

overvoltage referred to the gas concentration at the TPB conditions. The difference between 

Eq. (3.64) and (3.65) is clear. The first one explicitly considers the influence from the 

concentration of reactants and products at anode/electrolyte reaction sites, whereas the 

second form does not.  

A similar expression to Eq. (3.60) can be obtained to account for the “kinetic loss” in the 

case the reactant concentration at the TPB is decreased relative bulk concentration. 

Accordingly, the bulk concentration          should be used in the Eq. (3.64), in place of 

           . The goal here is just to take this effect (“concentration difference between the bulk 

and the TPB”) out from the activation polarization (     ) and consider this effect as an 

additional term inside the concentration polarization (     ). This is similar to what have been 

discussed about reversible voltages (i.e.,     
    versus     

    ) during the definition of 

concentration polarization. For illustrative purposes, such derivation can be realized using a 

simplified BVE, only valid for the high-current-density region (within which the cathodic term in 

Eq. (3.64)  may be disregarded):  

        *(
        

       
)

 

   (
                 

    

  
)+              

      
  

          
 (3.66) 

 

when written in terms of the activation polarization, Eq. (3.66) becomes

Note that it has been made explicit that the activation polarization is now referred to the bulk 

gas concentration,      
    . Combining the “Nernstian loss” (         ), as given by Eq. (3.60), 

and the “kinetic loss” (     ) in a general expression for the concentration polarization, one 

obtains

The application of Eq. (3.70) in lieu of Eq. (3.60) is of questionable usefulness, as the 

former relies in a very particular definition of concentration polarization which, as mentioned in 

the foregoing, is seldom invoked. The so-called “concentration-induced kinetic losses”, as 

defined by Eq. (3.69), might be seen as an indirect concentration loss, rather than the 

concentration polarization itself. Nonetheless, such “conceptual artificiality”, applied in order to 

distinguish between the conditions at the TPB from that of the bulk flow, could be of interest if 

one is concerned in “bookkeeping” several types of polarizations, based on somewhat 

discretionary criterion for identifying these very same polarizations (similar to what has been 

pointed out in §§2.3). What should be clear is that in using Eq. (3.67) and (3.70) one is actually 

“transferring the evaluation” of        
   

 from the term       to       (see also discussion in

respectively, akin to the formula given by Eq. (3.70) in the case of anode. Thus, in this 

particular case, the voltage losses       and       do not constitute pure concentration 

polarizations in the “Nernstian sense”, but a “hybrid polarization” that also incorporates indirect 

losses (     ) associated to electrode kinetics, caused by changes in species concentration. 

The usage of Eq. (3.70) can become difficult to work with, if the corresponding 

phenomenological description of electrode kinetics is rather complex. For example, 

expressions for the exchange current density        (or, equivalently,   
 ) are also themselves 

functions of species concentration
[ 83, 146, 84, 75, 121]

, as seen in §§2.3.4. Particularly, the 



Chapter 3 ? Mass Transfer Limitations and Concentration Losses 108 
 

dependence of        on the surface coverage of oxide-ions (    
  ) might also be explicitly 

considered
[ 111, 116, 75, 121]

, thereby constituting another potential source of concentration-

induced kinetic losses. However, this type of dependence is usually not described in a simple 

mathematical form that would benefit the formalism (and usefulness) of Eq. (3.70).  Take, for 

instance, the following expression for the exchange current density of a MIEC electrode
[ 111]

: 

                      
          (

     
  

)    with      (    
     )  (3.73) 

 

where        is the rate constant (evaluated at equilibrium conditions) of the reverse reaction, 

e.g. Eq. (3.24a), which is also admitted to be the rate-limiting step in the case of this equation. 

To derive an expression in the form of Eq. (3.64) using the result of Eq. (3.73), so to obtain a 

formula as directed by Eq. (3.70), is not quite straightforward. More importantly, the merits of 

such derivation are not obvious on their own. 

 

 

The intent of this section is not put forth actual arguments to prove or disprove likely 

cross-effects, but to furnish a few brief remarks, which apparently departure from the main 

subject of this dissertation (i.e., they are in fact brief digressions), that could illustrate what one 

really refers to when one discusses the relation between mass transport and cross-effects. In 

discussing cross-effects that stem from concurrent transport phenomena and how they can (or 

cannot) determine single-cell performance, the aim is to go beyond the topics frequently 

covered by the literature about mass transport in SOFCs. Usually, these cross-effects are 

either tacitly assumed to be negligible or the knowledge of their existence is just ignored. In the 

rare occasions when some of these cross-effects are evaluated, the applied phenomenological 

theory is, more often than not, misconceived
[ 59, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153]

.  

The term “cross-effects” is a designation employed here to express the complex 

interaction between multiscale-multiphysics processes. The manifestation of cross-effects has 

many facets. For instance, they can manifest when physicochemical processes taking place on 

dissimilar spatio-temporal scales become somehow “linked” (or coupled) through the so-called 

“bridging scales”
[ 154, 155]

. That is, these processes can start to interact once their characteristic 

scales “overlap” (i.e., when they are within the same finite scale limit) and the constraints 

limiting their ability to influence each other are somewhat “weakened”. Here, particularly, the 

concept of “bridging scales” is inserted in the context of developing accurate large scale 

descriptions of particles interacting in the small scale
[ 156]

, especially when microscopic 

interactions emerge on a large scale and the specific (“unaveraged”) details from their 



Chapter 3 ? Mass Transfer Limitations and Concentration Losses 109 
 

microworld affect the validity of macroscale deterministic field equations. Very crudely this is to 

say that the hydrodynamic behavior of microscopic systems non-longer has an infinite scale 

separation
[ 156, 157, 158]

.  

Since a proper description of “microscale-to-macroscale interactions” depends on 

specific mathematical models, cross-effects may be seen as the physical manifestation of the 

many possible mathematical couplings that are allowed to occur as a coupled effect of 

irreversible processes, under certain conditions, according to an established theoretical 

framework. Among the existing frameworks, the one proposed by the thermodynamics of 

irreversible processes
8
 (TIP)

[ 79, 80, 159, 160, 161]
 seems to provide the most intelligible (and 

numerous) examples in the mass transfer literature. Moreover, engineers (specially chemical 

engineers) are usually acquainted with TIP, as it forms the cornerstone of the so-called linear 

phenomenological transport theory, or just “transport phenomena theory”
[ 162, 163]

. Presumably, 

the most common examples of cross-effects (or “reciprocal phenomena”, in the usual 

terminology used by TIP) between irreversible processes are
[ 45, 164]

: (i) coupling of heat and 

mass diffusive transports, namely Soret-Dufour effects; (ii) thermoelectric phenomena, namely 

Peltier–Seebeck-Thomson effects; (iii) electrokinetic (and mechano-electric) effects; (iv) and 

the lesser-known, “chemical viscosity”
[ 165]

.  

However, the results from this specific continuum theory ought not to be used in 

drawing definitive conclusions about what cross-effects are or whether they can or cannot 

occur (e.g., see debate on the illusive  “Curie principle”
[ 148, 150, 151]

). First and foremost, one 

would need to start with more “conceptually robust” frameworks, such as rational 

thermodynamics, extended non-equilibrium theories, mesoscopic hydrodynamics, and the like
[ 

150, 166]
. This is indeed the case when “cross-effects” are to be generalized to include additional 

cross-relations between driving forces, property fluxes, and constraining surfaces; relations 

that are not considered by classical theories of transport phenomena (e.g., see [ 167]). On the 

other hand, “extended frameworks” often require intricate mathematical developments and 

vigorous diligence in order to perceive the abstract mathematics inherent to these more 

advanced theories. For this reason, TIP is usually employed with the intent of constructing 

simplified expositions. 

In any event, it is important to have in mind the intrinsic limitations and the possible 

inconsistencies of applying the linear theory of transport phenomena (unfortunately, however, 

this is seldom the case in the literature). The ordinary case is that these limitations are only 

discussed when the possible shortcomings of the local equilibrium hypothesis
[ 79]

 (or postulate) 

are brought about. The “violation” or inadequacy of this theoretical assumption is quite often 

                                                      
8
 Also referred to as linear non-equilibrium thermodynamics or classical non-equilibrium thermodynamics. 



Chapter 3 ? Mass Transfer Limitations and Concentration Losses 110 
 

justified only for systems “far-from-equilibrium”
[ 168]

. Even though this is surely true, it remains 

to be properly defined what is the “far-from-equilibrium physics” one is specifically talking 

about. Concerning this aspect, the analysis of “equilibrium versus non-equilibrium” states in 

non-condensed matter seems to be restricted to the evaluation of the relative importance of 

local gradients in state variables
[ 169, 170]

. Thus, emphasis is only placed on the gradient 

magnitude itself and not on the effects related to transport processes “competing” on disparate 

physical scales, the latter case being (often) overlooked. This is to say that it is not solely the 

magnitude of local gradients that should be taken into consideration when evaluating cross-

effects, but also the comparative importance (e.g., ratio) between gradients of different state 

variables and how these are correlated over their characteristic length and time scales. 

Furthermore, failure to recognize the correct number of degrees of freedom in the 

“microscopic” thermodynamic description can lead to a subtle violation of the “local equilibrium” 

postulate, which lies in the core of TIP theory. 

As it has been stated above, the validity of phenomenological macroscale equations 

can be compromised when the large scale description, provided by these equations, is 

controlled by the details of microscopic interactions. In practice, however, many times all that 

one can observe are changes in the macroscopic state described by gas quantities (e.g., 

density, velocity, temperature, stresses, and heat flux) that are (supposedly) related to suitable 

averages of quantities depending on microscopic states
[ 171]

. From this point of view, one 

needs to establish certain hypotheses regarding the structure and interaction of molecules, for 

which the precise details are rarely known unless for only oversimplified systems. At this point, 

one faces a great difficulty that affects not only the TIP framework, but virtually any 

macroscale-continuum phenomenological approach (e.g., see [ 172]):  “to explain things that 

are seen and directly measurable by means of imagined things that are not seen and not 

directly measurable”
[ 171]

. Based on these established hypotheses, one needs to ascertain 

whether measurable macroscopic quantities do or do not approximate the a priori assumed 

relations between those macroscopic gas quantities. It seems apparent that the imperfect 

representation of the actual molecular behavior by “model molecules” or “fictitious particles”
[ 

171, 77]
 might impair any successful undertaking. The odds of getting plausible results are further 

minimized when there is the necessity of considering only the description of ideal systems, in 

contrast to more realistic situations wherein definitions such as the mean free path, for 

example, can lose some of their definiteness if the molecules are surrounded by “non-

idealized” force fields
[ 173, 174]

. On the other hand, the modeling complexity might be 

enormously magnified if some of these simplifying conditions (e.g., absence of force fields) are 

relaxed to the detriment of a realistic description.  



Chapter 3 ? Mass Transfer Limitations and Concentration Losses 111 
 

In the traditional approach it is usual to begin with the necessary governing equations
9
 

and a set of general constitutive equations (sometimes also referred to as “rate equati ons”) 

based on the principles (and accepted hypotheses) from TIP. In the context of TIP, rate 

equations are flux relations needed in order to relate mass, momentum, and energy fluxes. On 

this particular aspect, many existing mathematical models utterly fail, insofar they “are unable” 

to recognize the coupling between additional fluxes and thermodynamic driving forces, beyond 

those dictated by the existing state of affairs in mass transfer theories, such as the “Curie 

Principle”
[ 80, 159, 162]

. Extended non-equilibrium theories show
[ 150, 149, 175, 176]

, however, that the 

property expressed by the “Curie principle” follows from pure tensorial (isomorphism) 

arguments, i.e. from the isotropy of linear constitutive functions and from the representation 

theorems of such functions
[ 177, 178]

. On the other hand, theorems for nonlinear isotropic 

constitutive functions (e.g., see [ 179, 180]) show that this “principle” is not valid in general. 

Thus, in spite of many TIP advocators
 
have been contumaciously defending the “Curie 

principle” using mostly rhetorical arguments
[ 181, 162, 65, 64]

, it must not be considered a 

comprehensive physically-based restriction. 

More specifically, and what is of most interest in this dissertation work, the 

phenomenological modeling of mass diffusion in multicomponent fluid systems
[ 182, 183, 184, 64, 185, 

186, 187, 188]
 has also been littered by this theoretical myopia originated from the “Curie principle” 

stigma, even in the cases where the model was originally derived using the results of kinetic 

theory or based on statistical mechanics considerations. In addition, it is not uncommon to 

have errors in the derivation of transport equations that are really hard to grasp, because they 

arise from subtle inconsistences when one tries to translate “concepts from the microworld” to 

the large scale description. This is the case of [ 188], wherein an erroneous formulation of the 

interspecies “diffusion kinetic energy”
[ 60, 189]

 leads to misleading assertions about the “what is 

correct expression” of the chemical potential, when formulated as the driving force for mass 

diffusion processes. There are exceptions, certainly, or at least there are partial exceptions, 

where consistent mathematical models were indeed derived based on a phenomenological 

description of hydrodynamic diffusion, but these works (e.g., see [ 190, 191, 192]) have been 

either obscured over the years or have not attracted enough attention from scholars in both the 

chemical engineering and SOFC research communities. Still in the context of mass diffusion, 

examples of cross-effects that have been commonly overlooked by unfavorable analyzes, 

biased by the views of TIP, include: (i) diffusion slip
[ 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199]

 phenomenon
10

; (ii)

 Governing equations are usually referred to as “conservation laws”, although a better terminology would be 

“balance laws” as some of these equations are not really, strictly speaking, statements of conserved quantities 
(such as in the case of the specific entropy

[ 78]
).

  Also referred to as the “Kramers-Kistemaker effect”. 



Chapter 3 ? Mass Transfer Limitations and Concentration Losses 112 
 

barodiffusion
[ 200, 195, 201]

, and (iii) shear-Induced migration
[ 202]

 (non-equilibrium “diffusion-like” 

movement of mass, which is influenced by the presence of walls, as in the case of rarefied gas 

flows in porous media
[ 203, 204, 153, 205]

).  

Modern installments of classical textbooks on mass transfer, such as the works of Bird 

et al.
[ 162]

, Deen
[ 206]

, and Slattery
[ 207]

, still relies on a faulty understanding of multicomponent 

mass diffusion, by disregarding “non-conventional” cross-effects and (as will be addressed in 

the next paragraphs) also the effects of chemical reactions on diffusive transport, momentum 

closure, and the ratio of total mass fluxes. Furthermore, the Curie principle is again invoked to 

state that diffusion flux, chemical reactions, and momentum do not interact whatsoever, even 

though there is empirical evidence proving otherwise
[ 202, 208, 165]

. It is interesting to note, 

however, that Landau and Lifshitz
[ 209]

, in their famous and respected  “Course of Theoretical 

Physics”, have made an important comment that goes beyond their typical TIP-based 

derivation for the equations of fluid dynamics. They recognized that (based on kinetic theory 

arguments) the high-order derivatives of momentum quantities, such as the Laplacian of the 

velocity field, may couple with the diffusion density vector (i.e., mass flux), depending on the 

order of magnitude of certain characteristic length scales that govern the rate of momentum 

transfer. Here Landau and Lifshitz were referring to the barodiffusion effect, as conceived by 

Zhdanov and coauthors
[ 200]

. 

To conclude the present section, another matter of great controversy, now concerning 

the ratios between species fluxes, is presented. Although many works in the literature discuss 

a physically motivated origin for the ratio of the total mass (or molar)  fluxes
[ 210, 59, 211, 212, 213, 214, 

197, 215, 216]
, this is not a completely solved issue and it remains, to a great extent, a zone of 

theoretical uncertainty. Equimolar counter-diffusion, Graham’s Law, and flux ratios defined by 

chemical reaction stoichiometry are among the various alleged flux “constraints”. Nevertheless, 

one must note that in the absence of chemical reactions the ratio of fluxes is beyond any 

“predetermined control"” and flux ratios must adjust themselves to satisfy the balance law of 

momentum (for both the mean motion and for each species contained in the gas mixture). At 

this point resides an additional problem related to the (a priori unknown) nature of the 

constitutive equations that should be incorporated into this balance law. Distinct transport 

mechanisms in Knudsen, viscous flow, and transition regions
[ 210]

 seem to greatly difficult this 

task of ascertaining the correct use of material-dependent constitutive information. Finally, 

added to this is the fact that total fluxes might not be correctly (unambiguously) expressed 

relative to any frame of reference
[ 217, 218, 219, 211, 220, 221,  222, 223]

, as in the case of mechanically 

constrained porous membranes. 



Chapter 3 ? Mass Transfer Limitations and Concentration Losses 113 
 

The drag of the moving species on the porous matrix will tend to move the membrane, 

unless it is mechanically constrained (i.e., unless the interphase “hydraulic” drag is counter-

reacted in some way). Assuming the porous matrix as a “non-deformable solid”, it will transfer 

the contact (frictional) forces to the support that ties the matrix to its surroundings. Thus, in 

order to the membrane remain stationary an external “clamping” force exerted by the supports 

on the membrane must be applied. As a result of this force that prevents membrane 

movement, there can be pressure gradients whether or not there are body forces in the fluid 

system. By their turn, these pressure gradients (or other external “unbalanced forces” acting 

on the permeating gases) may cause viscous flow based on purely hydrodynamics 

considerations. Even though one can identify a “viscous velocity” for the mean flow (i.e., 

mixture’s mass-average velocity), it may not be the situation for the individual viscous 

velocities of the components, which are about the same only If there are no additional forces 

hindering their movement relative to the fixed frame of reference (e.g., adsorption forces on 

pore walls). It comes without saying that in this case the gas-matrix (i.e., gas-wall) friction 

terms (“Knudsen diffusivities”) will determine the ratio of fluxes. 

However, in the presence of chemical reactions (occurring in the bulk volume and/or on 

the surfaces of solid obstacles) the momentum balance equations do not suffice to determine 

the flux ratio and supplementary information is therefore necessary, many times in the form of 

second law thermodynamic constrained inequalities, such as those derived from the linear 

non-equilibrium thermodynamics formalism
[ 80, 79]

 (e.g., binomial combinations of 

“thermodynamics forces” and conjugated fluxes or transport rates). When chemical reaction 

occurs within a porous domain, is the flux ratio is determined by the stoichiometry of the 

reaction? Since the flux ratio determined by the stoichiometry may differ from the flux ratio 

required to satisfy the momentum governing equation at uniform pressure, internal pressure 

gradients may accompany chemical reactions, as suggested by Hoogschagen
[ 214]

 and 

Haynes
[ 212]

. One can suspect that these gradients to be significant whenever chemical 

reactions rates are sufficiently intense (i.e., resulting in “large” spatial gradients in the mean 

gas density) and if pore diameter is sufficiently small (i.e., resulting in appreciable rarefication 

effects). More precisely, if a chemical reaction (or a set of reactions) causes a net change in 

the total number of moles, then it will cause a pressure gradient. In fact, this change will result 

in a net molar flow of gas into (or out) the domain and the pressure will be higher (or lower) 

inside the domain than outside. Nonetheless, additional research is required to elucidate the 

factors which determine the flux ratio in these cases. Be that as it may, the effects of internal 

pressure gradients in the porous SOFCs layers are often neglected. However, neglecting 

pressure gradients leads to inconsistencies in the flux calculations
[ 224, 225]

 and it can certainly 



Chapter 3 ? Mass Transfer Limitations and Concentration Losses 114 
 

violate mass conservation, sometimes in a very obvious manner (e.g., when mass fractions do 

not add up to unity
[ 66]

). 

In the general case, the species conservation equation and constitutive equations for 

mass diffusion flux (e.g., Maxwell-Stefan equation) must be supplemented by an equation for 

the macroscopic pressure gradient in the system. The simplest (and usual) approach in the 

SOFC literature is to consider the total pressure constant (as will be seen in Chapter 4). 

However, as pointed out above, this alternative is inadequate if species concentrations are 

non-uniform along the system. When it is considered, the establishment of a pressure gradient 

in the system is usually linked through the local Gibbs-Duhem equation (GDE): 

   ?   ( ?
   
   

   

      

   

)

    

   

 ?   ( ?
   
   

    

      

   

 
   
  

   )

    

   

 (3.74) 

 

where      (                   ), which thereby eliminates degrees of freedom of the 

system. That is, under the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium and phase homogeneity, 

the GDE places a restriction on the simultaneous variations in the intensive thermodynamic 

variables of a given multicomponent phase. In principle, nevertheless, the GDE as expressed 

above applies only to homogeneous macroscopic systems. For instance, the GDE does not 

remain valid for systems having internal state variables
[ 151]

, inhomogeneous (i.e., as in 

nonadditive) entropies
[ 226, 227]

, or long-range interactions
[ 228]

 such as those giving rise to shear 

viscosity.  

Rigorously speaking, therefore, the GDE alone should not be used for deriving 

conclusions about the pressure gradient of non-equilibrium flows in porous bodies
[ 229]

. Even if 

the GDE is valid under the assumption of local equilibrium, the pressure term that appears in 

this equation cannot be unambiguously identified with the macroscopic pressure gradient from 

the momentum (“hydrodynamic”) balance equation.  Instead, it compares with a local gradient 

that is only valid (i.e., properly defined) within the considered infinitesimal finite-volume. Similar 

criticism has been already suggested by Truesdell
[ 230]

 for multicomponent diffusion theories 

based on TIP.  

The ambiguity concerning the use of GDE in the TIP formalism dates back to the work 

of Prigogine
[ 159]

, more specifically “Prigogine’s theorem on the independence of the (entropic) 

dissipation function on the choice of reference velocity”, a result that was further noted by 

Lightfoot
[ 163]

. In this particular context, the GDE has been used “to prove” that the summation 

of so-called “diffusion driving force” over all mixture components is identically zero in all 

domain interior points. Krishna and other authors
[ 64, 65, 185, 65, 231, 232]

, in their derivations of 

Maxwell-Stefan equations, have also implicitly assumed that the pressure gradient as defined 



Chapter 3 ? Mass Transfer Limitations and Concentration Losses 115 
 

by GDE is valid in the condition of “mechanical equilibrium”, that is, when the sum of pressure -

driven forces and body forces acting on the fluid per unity mass (or volume) is vanishing 

small
11

. These controversial derivations also convey ambiguity and can result in misleading 

conclusions about the validity of Maxwell-Stefan equations. Moreover, in the presence of 

external forces (such as those stemming from the mechanical restraint a membrane) the 

entropic dissipation function depends explicitly on the mass-average (center-of-mass) velocity 

and thus the reference velocity for diffusive fluxes cannot be chosen arbitrarily, making 

Prigogine's theorem invalid
[ 219, 217 229]

. 

The short essay that has been presented in the preceding pages, besides expressing 

the author’s academic opinion on the phenomenological modeling of mass diffusion in 

multicomponent fluid systems, is so provided to put into perspective the content of Chapter 4 

(specially the models representing the diffusive mass transfer within porous SOFC layers). As 

none of the topics analyzed and evaluated in the present section will be covered in the 

remaining parts of this work, with the exception of what is examined in §§A.5 (see APPENDIX 

A), it is important to make the following clarifications: 

I. Most (if not all) mass transfer models in Chapter 4 are theoretically flawed in 

their very core. Nevertheless, they may be (and, in fact, they are) still 

successfully used in the numerical simulation of SOFC devices, but solely based 

on their verifiable empirical consequences. Thus, “errors” and limitations 

mentioned in this section do not, in general, invalidate these phenomenological 

models from a pragmatic standpoint.  
 

II. However, even though these mass transfer models have been “safely” applied in 

the simulation of solid-oxide fuel cells, in what conditions these models can in 

fact be used remains a problematic and critical issue. That is, it remains unclear 

what their applicability limits are and so remain their trust-regions, whose 

knowledge is necessary to establish confidence in the results of numerical 

simulations.

 It is worth noting that shear stresses terms have not appeared during their derivations and no reasons were 
provided for such omission.

In general terms, modeling techniques aim to obtain some sort of representation, 

usually of mathematical form, of the state of a natural system. The result of mathematical 

modeling is the description of multiphysics processes (i.e., a description about how the natural 

world is believed to function) using a set of concise mathematical concepts and rules. It is 

hoped that the model may help to explain and also make “predictions” about the behavior of 

the natural system, especially when studying the effect of changes in influential factors or 

components of this system.  

Mathematical modeling can be utilized as either a theoretical or working tool
[ 233]

. The 

latter is mostly concerned with quantitative models (usually to support some kind of decision 

making), while the former is more comprehensive in scope, also including process qualitative 

aspects. Qualitative aspects are central, for example, when one is interested in developing a 

scientific understanding of the intricacies of multiphysics processes, rather than to only 

accurately quantify them. There is a wide spectrum of modeling techniques, thus aprioristic 

classification of all these techniques, in pre-determined groups, is to some extent subjective 

and views about such classification may differ amongst different authors
[ 234]

.  In this work, 

notably, a simple classification is proposed (see Fig. 4.1) to highlight the goal of a given 

mathematical model. This classification involves the so-called “white-box” and “black-box” 

models, so referred to as “physical modeling” and “empirical modeling”, respectively.

Figure 4.1: classification of the mathematical models discussed in §§4.2 through §§4.8 (figure by the author). 

 
Models are classified as white-box when the state of the system is accurately known 

and its behavior can be described in the form of “balance laws” (equations of mass, 

momentum, and energy conservation) and “constitutive equations” (equations involving 

material properties). These models, allegedly, often lead to the most general description of 

multiphysics processes. However, there are critical elements of compromise in such modeling 

approach. The majority of natural systems are far too complicated to model in their entirety, 

thus in practice white-box models demand comprehensive interdisciplinary scientific research, 

often resulting in very complex mathematical descriptions. Therefore, when applying white -box 

models, the first kind of compromise is to identify the most relevant parts of the system that will 

be included in the model and what will be wisely disregarded. The second kind of compromise 

concerns the amount of mathematical manipulation (computation) which is feasible under 

certain established criteria (e.g., simulation runtime, computer memory usage, and so on). 

Although physically-based models have the potential to provide more general results, these 

results do not come without additional costs, such as the development of more robust, reliable, 

and complex numerical methods.

Models are classified as “black-box” when the state of a system is not known and its 

behavior is described through a collection of input data (“what influences the system behavior”) 

and output data (“the resulting behavior of the system”). Historical data are used to develop 

models that can describe the dependencies between input and output data. Data sets usually 

constitute empirical information, but it may not always be the case (e.g., part of the data could 

be obtained with help from physical modeling). In this sense, black-box models departures 

from the purely theoretical description of a process. Black-box models are frequently used as 

the basis for predictive control and dynamic optimization of industrial-scale systems due to 

their relatively cheap computation effort and simple mathematical structures, which are used to 

solve the problem in question (i.e., processing inputs and predicting outputs). 

The goal of the present work is to analyze physical modeling techniques. Thus, reviews 

about black-box models will be touched on very briefly. By the expression “typical modeling 

techniques” it is meant the most representative (white-box) models applied in the SOFC 

literature. Certainly it would be impossible to include all modeling techniques presented to 

date, and this would be a meaningless task as well, given that the content of this dissertation 

will inevitable age from the moment it is published. The following critical review should help 

drawing some general ideas about what delineates the fine lines separating judicious 

simplifications (when the most relevant parts of the system are correctly identified) from 

“theoretical fantasies” (when such identification is misleading). 

 

 

 

Traditional SOFC models proved of little use for power plant modeling
[ 235]

, mainly 

because most of the effort has been devoted to depict the intricacies of primordial microscale 

electrochemical processes that occur on electrode surfaces. Thus, significantly less attention 

was directed to the development of system-level models. Furthermore, traditional models often 

revel themselves overly sensitive to minute changes in parameters, which makes them 

unsuitable for distinguishing between “design point” and “off-design” operation of specific plant  

components, hindering the overall process of system optimization
[ 235]

.  From the engineering 

point of view, when developing models for power plant modeling purposes, the critical 

requirement is to have a mathematical model which gives reasonable results, and can be 

used, with the required confidence level, for design and device selection purposes. 

Phenomena occurring on electrode surfaces, although important, must not take up an 

inordinate amount of attention
[ 235]

. Moreover, these small scale phenomena are difficult to 



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 119 
 

measure and, as a result of this, large sets of experimental data are seldom available. For 

industrial-scale systems, however, a mathematical model is worth little without reliable 

validation and thus hard experimental data are mandatory. “Hard data” are those whose 

experiment offers both a complete narrative about experimental procedures and detailed 

information on operating parameters. Especially for fully-empirical black-box models, the lack 

of reliable data undermines any serious attempt of validation.  

System-level models represent a significant simplification when compared to more 

complex physically-based modeling approaches. Their simplicity comes from the fact that they 

can use simpler “processing rules” (applied to a large collection of data sets). Another 

advantage of these system-level (black-box) models is that they can create functional relations 

between inputs and outputs solely on the basis of experimental data, ignoring 

phenomenological approaches. Therefore, fully-empirical models can be implemented in those 

cases where physical models are inexistent or are unfeasible for practical reasons. A notorious 

drawback is that fully-empirical models are able to “detect” only those dependencies that are 

already present in the data used to develop the processing rules, thus precluding any general 

description of such dependencies
[ 235]

. To tackle this problem, at least partially, one can 

combine modeling through “first-principles” and data-based approaches
[ 44]

. There are a 

number of works in the SOFC literature that applied pure (data-based) black-box models, or a 

combination of these with ad hoc physical modeling techniques, to support analysis at the 

system level. In these works, the system under study considered either only the fuel cell stack 

or the entire SOFC module, which further included BOP components (e.g., anode recycle 

plenum; pre-reformer; ejectors; compressors; turbines; and heat exchangers). These system-

level models have been most often used to: (i) optimize SOFC designs under steady-state 

conditions; (ii) estimate SOFC state during transient operation, i.e., track the profile of 

operating variables during step changes in the cell current density, or in other input 

parameters; and (iii) dynamic modeling for predictive control purposes. In this context, some 

selected works of the literature will now be briefly reviewed. 

Milewski and coworkers
[ 235, 236]

 applied the artificial neural network (ANN) model to 

simulate the SOFC parametric behavior, merely utilizing available experimental data (i.e., in 

this case the ANN was implemented as a fully-empirical model). Potentially, analyses based 

on the results obtained could then be used to optimize the SOFC design. However, in this work 

the objective was only to analyze the effects of various (operating and design) parameters, 

such as: fuel flow; fuel utilization factor; diluents types and their concentration; oxidant flow; 

oxidant utilization factor; and cell operating temperature. The testing apparatus was a single 

planar stack installed in a heated ceramic furnace. The investigated cell was a circular type 



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 120 
 

seal-less SOFC (    8    cermet anode). The ANN model
[ 237, 238]

 is based on the so-called 

methods of artificial intelligence (AI) that, in rough terms, try to imitate the methods of data 

processing of living organisms in order to describe phenomena of interest
[ 239]

. The application 

of AI methods to solve engineering and scientific problems is a result of the emergence of a 

new research field called “empirical modeling and data mining”, which brings together 

computational intelligence, statistics, and numerical methods. This field is also referred to as 

“soft-computing”
[ 240, 241]

. The model developed by Milewski and coworkers to simulate a SOFC 

provides an alternative to overcome the limitations of simple linear physical models, which do 

not enable accurate quantitative description (although they can qualitatively capture the main 

features) of highly nonlinear physical phenomena. Such limitations are more acute when the 

system under analysis has multiple inputs (parameters and/or variables), as in Fig. 4.2. Even 

though ANN models use computationally simple methods to build dependencies between 

inputs and outputs, they have good nonlinear properties and thus are capable of identifying 

possible solutions with relative easiness, when compared to physical modeling approaches (for 

system-level problems, at least).

A hybrid model was also implemented by Milewski et al.
[ 235]

, consisting of an ANN 

model and mathematical expressions (phenomenological models) for some input parameters 

(see Fig. 4.2c). Through this model, Milewski and coworkers investigated various input 

parameters, one by one, and one of these models was created with 12 input parameters and 

one output (see Fig. 4.2c). One may refer to the latter case as univariate modeling in respect 

to outputs. These authors utilized 31 voltage-current curves (comprising over 580 experimental 

points) to train a network wherein the cell voltage was the only output parameter. The network 

was trained until it learned the experimental data within a maximum acceptable error level. 

Note that large data sets are required for both ANN training and final model validation.  

Available experimental data can teach ANNs about the global effect regarding certain 

parameters that impose concentration losses to a SOFC, such as anode porosity and fuel 

dilution (see Fig. 4.3). However, ANN models are unable to provide any direct discrimination of 

associated voltage drops that are related to this or that type of polarization, among which is the 

concentration polarization. The process’s phenomenology is “hidden” by processing rules, 

which are, by their turn, built within the various neuron layers. In other words, cause -effect 

relations are not unambiguous, even when evaluating one parameter at time. Thus, at first, 

conventional ANN models are not suited to study the inner structures of multiphysics 

processes. This is not a problem, if one applies black-box models considering the objectives 

already set out above for system-level models. ANN models can also be used to “extend the 

range of experimental results” and additional data so obtained could be used as a reference 

for comparison by physical modeling approaches. Obviously though, this procedure should not 

be taken as equivalent to any true validation test.

Other types of data-based modes have been developed for SOFCs. Firstly, there are 

those which are combined with ad hoc physical models and thus take into consideration more 

details of chemical and thermal aspects, requiring the solution of a set of nonlinear ODEs
[ 242, 

243, 244]
. In the most common situation, these physics-based models are zero-dimensional or 

quasi-1D models of fuel cell system components
[ 245, 246, 247, 248]

.  Secondly, there are dynamic 

models that are mostly data-based and developed through a system identification approach
[ 44, 

249
]. These data-based dynamic models can be used to investigate responses of SOFCs under 

different operating conditions and then, by means of optimum control, one can steer the 

operating conditions towards a more favorable operating point (“off-design” condition), so to 

improve durability and efficiency of fuel cells
[ 44]

. Process modeling, state estimation, and 

design of the controller itself are part of advanced processes control strategies. They are 

intrinsically dependent on each other, insofar as the model development affects both the 

design of the controller and selection of state estimation techniques. In general, data-based 

modes are most useful for controller design purposes. Both advanced controls (e.g., nonlinear 

model predictive controller) and conventional controls have been implemented in SOFC power 

systems.  

There is no point in discussing data-based models any further, as this would not benefit 

the main goal of this work. Nonetheless, one final remark can be made about physics-based 

model-predictive control of SOFCs. The key point of these models is that they try to 

incorporate physical knowledge about SOFC behavior into real-time MIMO (multiple-input and 

multiple-output) process-control strategies. More precisely, the controller includes some 

(reduced) form of a “high-fidelity”, physics-based model that represents physical-chemical 

processes. However, because such complex nonlinear model cannot be solved in real time, as 

part of the controller logic, linear reduced-order state-space models are required. The model 

reduction is accomplished via system identification, which is the data-based part of the 

modeling technique. Before this reduction step, one needs to first select a simplified (“lumped”) 

physical model to describe the mass diffusion of gas-phase species. The next step consists in 

deriving a transfer function (Laplace transform) of the chosen mass transport equation and 

then to incorporate it into the set of time-dependent ODEs that represent the overall mass 

balance, which is written in a format suitable for process control purposes (i.e., a model which 

approximates derivatives of input variables from measurable variables). Ultimately, the 

objective is to design controller input signals in terms of the partial pressures of gas-phase 

species
[ 250]

, as exemplified on Fig. 4.4. Thus, physics-based model-predictive control is more 

about the method of deriving state functions and establishing a control strategy, and much less 

about the fidelity of physical models.

. This model was developed to control the stack terminal 

voltage of a SOFC system, according to Eq. (2.21). The submodel applied for the concentration polarization       
is given by equations Eq. (2.37) and (2.38). 

 

 

The analytical modeling of SOFCs aims to find analytical solutions to fundamental 

problems, ranging from single-cell performance to stack operation analysis. According to 

Kulikovsky
[ 12]

, this approach uses “simplified” models based on idealized systems, basic 

geometries, and “minimal” assumptions, enabling the qualitative understanding of the causes 

and effects of important phenomena that take place in fuel cells. 

Equations describing SOFC physicochemical processes are often overly complicated 

and, in general, only numerical solutions are possible. The SOFC literature on numerical 

simulations is the prevailing trend today and the number of publications has been increasing 

vigorously in recent years, at the pace in which the complexity of mathematical models also 

grows. Notwithstanding the many positive features provided by numerical simulations, the 

resulting information from such simulations is intrinsically limited in certain aspects. For 

instance, a numerical solution represents only a subset amongst the many soluti ons to the 

system of equations, and there are undoubtedly several other possible solutions in the 

multidimensional space of parameters determining the SOFC operation. Thus, if any 

meaningful parameter is changed then, in principle, another numerical solution is required 

before one could draw general conclusions. As the number of parameters can be quite large 

and each numerical calculation can constitute time-consuming tasks, a comprehensive 

parametric study through numerical simulations would be indeed a herculean effort. On the

other hand, analytical solutions resulting from a suitable (carefully chosen) model can show the 

explicit parametric dependency, a “general behavior” that can be inferred from closed-form 

mathematical expressions. Because these solutions offer a transparent view into how 

variables/parameters and interactions between variables/parameters affect the result, they 

may significantly facilitate the understanding of SOFC processes. Furthermore, sometimes 

they can even predict novel effects affecting cell performance
[ 251, 252]

 or can be used to 

pinpoint inconsistent results of a specific mathematical model
[ 253]

. 

The models in this section are based on similar considerations as those of the models 

that will be reviewed in §§4.5: considerations that stem from a macro-homogeneous approach. 

However, mathematical models in §§4.5 are “mathematically more complex”, and for this 

reason they will almost invariably require numerical solutions. More importantly, they do not 

share the same specific goals of analytical models.  Although this will be further explored in the 

next section, a few words about the macro-homogeneous approach may be instructive before 

proceeding to the discussion of analytical models. This approach, roughly speaking, “ignores” 

the microscopic details of SOFC porous layers, which are now considered as a “new 

continuum” (i.e., as an “interpenetrating continuum media”) with “homogenized” or lumped 

properties, which are usually taken from experiments or from microstructural models. Even 

though the macro-homogeneous approach has no convincing physical justification (it is a 

mathematical construct, after all), theoretical results obtained through this approach, within 

certain restrictions, have been validated by experimental data with reasonable agreement 

between them. Nonetheless, it does have limitations and they are plentiful, as will be examined 

more closely in this chapter. 

 

 

The main features of the active layer of a SOFC have been already succinctly 

described in in §§2.3.3. Here a simplified mathematical model for this layer is presented, which 

investigates the effects of mass-transport on an electrochemical reaction obeying either Tafel 

or Butler-Volmer kinetics. To this end, the model of Perry–Newman–Cairns
[ 104]

 was 

generalized by Kulikovsky
[ 12, 107]

 to investigate the active layer (see Fig. 2.10) of an generic 

electrode (anode or cathode), considering the situations of ideal ionic transport and/or ideal 

gas mass transport. Kulikovsky has also incorporated further simplifications to contrast a 

number of limiting cases that are encountered at high or low current density regimes. Despite 

these simplifications (some of them are clearly unrealistic for real SOFCs), this model gives a 

reasonable account of the qualitative aspects of the problem, without inordinate mathematical 

complications. 



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 125 
 

In the specific case of Kulikovsky’s analytical models, a more detailed examination was 

given in this dissertation (see APPENDIX A) not because these models strictly fit the 

objectives of the present work, but because their analytical nature allow pinpointing, in a clear 

and general way, the definitions of “activation polarization” and “augmented polarization” (as 

already examined in §§2.3.1-§§2.3.4). However, the lengthier discussion was left to the 

appendix section to maintain the argumentation flow of this chapter leaner. By way of example 

of what ought to be criticized, Kulikovsky considers simplifying assumptions t hat do not hold for 

SOFCs, such as disregarding (as a general case) the importance of steam in anode kinetics. 

Kulikovsky tries to substantiate this assumption by citing one very specific reference
[ 254]

 and 

then clamming that “the modeling study indicates that the water concentration dependence is 

weak and to a first approximation it can be ignored” (see [ 255], pp. 6687). Although 

simplifications such as this may well fit the goals of an analytical model (of qualitative, almost 

didactical character), the argumentative strategy seems fallacious because that author tries to 

bestow upon the model a greater generality than can be justified based on its original premises 

or beyond over-simplistic arguments (unreasonable assumptions). Surely one can treat 

complex problems as if they were much simpler than they really are, but the limitations and 

“pitfalls” of such simplified treatment must be duly informed. Modeling generalizations are 

undoubtedly of great value, but they come at a “cost” and what “cost” this is should be assed 

with fair-mindedness. 

Kulikovsky derived analytical models for the particular cases of ideal ionic transport and 

ideal gas transport, and for each of these cases the limiting situations of high and low current 

density were considered for further simplifications. Kulikovsky starts with the following system 

of equations, which governs the active layer performance (see APPENDIX A):

  (       ? )

electrolyte to the anode outer layer);

reference molar concentration of feed gas;   is the reaction order in respect to feed gas;   is 

the half-cell (e.g., anodic) augmented polarization;     is the effective conductivity of electrolyte 

phase in the active layer;   is the effective diffusion coefficient of feed gas within the porous 

channels of active layer;   is the charge transfer coefficient; and     Is the Tafel slope. 



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 126 
 

According to Kulikovsky, Eq. (4.1) expresses the decay of ionic current with   at a rate 

given by Butler–Volmer electrode kinetics (RHS of this equation); Eq. (4.2) states that Ohm's 

law is valid for the electrolyte phase, relating the ionic current to the overvoltage gradient ; it is 

a material balance that establishes that the local diffusion flux of feed gas is equal to the local 

electronic current density (  =  ?    ) to be converted through the half-cell electrochemical 

reaction (molar flux of ions to be converted into free electrons); and the stoichiometry factor 

     in Eq. (4.3) does the conversion of current density to molar flux. In order to solve the 

problem, Kulikovsky nondimensionalized Eq. (4.1), (4.2), and (4.3) by using the following 

dimensionless variables and characteristic scaling parameters:

effective diffusion coefficient of feed gas is given by 

 ? =
         
       

 (4.9) 

 

The system of equations (4.5)-(4.7), which is controlled by three main parameters ( ,  ?, 

and  )?, describes the spatial distribution of state variables (ionic current, overvoltage, gas 

concentration, and the rate of electrochemical reaction) in the active layer. From the point of 

view of SOFC electrochemical performance, the polarization curve of the active layer, 

expressed though the relation  ?0 =  ?0   ?, is what constitutes our main interest when it is

applied to describe the cell behavior in response to various values of   and  ?. The “total” 

voltage loss (polarization) is given by the value of  0 at the active layer/electrolyte interface. 

The shape of the reaction rate,   
    , is also relevant in that it might support the optimization of 

catalyst design (e.g., load distribution in terms of   c  . cm ) within the electrode 

Analytical solutions for the system (4.5)-(4.7) are as yet unknown. Nevertheless, for the 

limiting cases of ideal ionic transport or ideal gas transport explicit analytical solutions can be 

derived. In Fig. 3.1 it is shown an example of solution for the case of ideal ionic transport (“gas 

diffusion-limited case”), whereas in Fig. 3.2 it is shown the case of ideal gas transport (“ionic 

conduction-limited case”). As discussed in APPENDIX A, in both cases an “undisclosed 

assumption” was made by that Kulikovsky, that the electronic phase of the composite 

electrode is a perfect conductor. Such assumption can be considered a very good 

approximation in macroscopic modeling of high-temperature SOFCs (see also §§2.3.2 and 

§§2.3.3). Also in APPENDIX A, it is shown that Kulikovsky’s model for the case gas diffusion-

limited case (which is used to evaluate the concentration polarization of a single-cell) is in 

error, restricting its application to very low current density values.

One noteworthy result of Kulikovsky’s analytical models is that, when solving 

numerically the full set of equations (4.5)-(4.7), without admitting further simplifications, they 

predict a condition of negligible concentration polarization associated with an optimal gas 

diffusion coefficient
[ 12]

. At first, one would expect as sufficient condition for the approximation 

of ideal gas transport that the gas diffusivity should tend to infinity (   ). However, at least 

theoretically, the contribution of gas transport to the cell voltage loss might be neglected if
[ 12]

 

 ?   ? =  ? (4.10) 

 

where  ?  in dimensional form is given by   =              ? . In other words, there seems to 

exist an optimal (local optimum) effective gas diffusion coefficient   , which provides a near 

minimal voltage loss in the active layer. At  ?   ?  the polarization  ?0 decreases rapidly with 

the growth of  ?, whereas for  ?   ?  the effect of  ? in lowering the polarization is marginal
[ 12]

. 

 

 

Kulikovsky has also developed an analytical model
[ 255]

 that takes into account the effect 

of fuel depletion along the gas channel of a planar SOFC anode (e.g., see Fig. 3.8). In this 

model, the active layer was modeled applying the analysis described in §§4.3.1, but in an 

integral form, i.e. with already-integrated forms of the governing equations (thus without 

resolving the state variables along the electrode thickness). For this reason, the model may be 

referred to as a quasi-2D model, because the problem is not solved for simultaneous 

equations in both spatial directions (gas channel flow direction and cell thickness direction).

This model will be addressed in §§4.10.2 as it is more properly regarded as a model for the 

reactor flow arrangement. As will be seen therein, a critical error exists in Kulikovsky’s model. 

More precisely, there is an erroneous assumption concerning the equipotential condition in the 

streamwise direction of the cell. 

More recently, a similar model to the one developed for a planar SOFC has been 

applied by Kulikovsky
[ 251, 256]

 to study the aging processes occurring non-uniformly along the 

cathode of a PEM fuel cell. Among the factors that could distort the optimal profile of the local 

current, thereby affecting the cell polarization curve, Kulikovsky dicussed the role of oxygen 

effective diffusivity variation along the gas channel in lowering the cell limiting current density.  

 

 

 

 

Application of analytical models in parametric modeling and extraction of 

physicochemical parameters from experiments is ubiquitous in the literature. Not only in SOFC 

research but probably in all scientific research fields that use mathematical modeling with 

some sense of practicality. The reason for that is evident: more often than not, relating the 

various essential quantities by “laws of nature” requires, first, that these quantities are 

identified by observation, experiment, and a posteriori verification. Cases wherein such 

relations are predicted theoretically prior to its experimental observation are less likely to 

happen. 

In SOFC research there are many examples of this sort, where different measurement 

techniques and mathematical models have been applied to estimate a multitude of 

physicochemical parameters. Examples vary from physics-based approaches to purely 

empirical-based, curve-fitting approaches (e.g., polynomial curve-fitting of experimental data, 

without regard to the particular form of the equations that describe the physics of the problem). 

One of the advantages of the physics-based approach is that it is built on the actual 

mechanisms involved in the electrodic phenomena. That is, by considering a credible 

description of the actual physical-chemical mechanisms, the fitting process tends to be better 

resolved, which tends to preclude problems such as the “non-uniqueness” of the fitted solution. 

While physics-based models are capable of providing more rigorous description to the 

problem in question, their numerical solution are often time-consuming, especially for 

multivariable optimization problems. Thus, obtaining an analytic solution to these models 



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 130 
 

presents a good compromise, insofar as it can be used to interpret physical processes, while  

demanding far less computational effort. There are not as many studies in the SOFC literature 

focusing on concentration losses and that make use of analytical modeling with the above -

mentioned goal. Most studies that are built on analytical models aim the extraction of electro-

kinetic parameters
[ 257, 258]

 related to either electrochemical conversion or charge transport in 

ion/electron conducting materials. Nevertheless, works dealing with the analytical modeling of 

gas diffusion in SOFCs are still numerous and representative examples will be presented in 

the following (in §§4.5 studies using non-analytical, physics-based approaches are reviewed). 

 

 

Virkar and coworkers
[ 82, 259, 260, 261]

 have developed a number of parametric models 

based on measurements made on cell materials and components, using traditional 

electrochemical techniques such as steady-state polarization curves (e.g.,       vs.  ). The 

essential goal of their models is to evaluate the dependence of polarization effects on various 

cell parameters, for instance: feed gas composition, including the presence of diluents in the 

feeding streams; operating temperature; thickness, porosity, and the tortuosity of porous 

electrodes. It should be note that many of the equations in their theoretical analysis resemble 

those already examined in §§3.4 and which applied the concept of limiting (or “short-circuit”) 

current density (  ). In one of their papers
1
, the analysis of concentration polarization starts 

with the following equations that govern the isothermal transport of gaseous species through 

porous electrodes, for a mixture of two gases (  and  ): 

 ?? = ?             ???? ?      (
     

  
   

)    (4.11a)

diffusivity (e.g., takes into account porosity and tortuosity of porous electrode);   
   and

 In that work

[ 82]
, anode-supported SOFCs were evaluated between 650°C and 800°C with humidified hydrogen 

as the fuel and air as the oxidant. Button cells were fabricated with     electrolyte ( 10  m),    /    composite 
cathode ( 50  m), and   /    composite anode (having a quite large thickness  750  m).

and    are mole fractions;    is the porous electrode permeability coefficient;   
    is an 

effective dynamic viscosity of the gas mixture within the porous medium;   is the total 

pressure;  ? is the total molar flux; and the parameters   ,   ,   ,     are as defined above. 

Equations (4.11a) and (4.11b) are derived from the widely known Dusty-Gas Model or 

DGM
[ 63]

, and the first expressions in Eq. (4.12a) and (4.12b) (for    and   , respectively) are 

known as the “Bosanquet formula”
[ 62]

. Despite its long-standing popularity, DGM is a 

conceptually flawed model
[ 211, 59, 221]

 that is based on a number of misleading mathematical 

derivations. Fortunately, for the models examined herein this will not be acritical issue as many 

of the conceptual inconsistencies of DGM “disappear” if the pressure gradient term is dropped  

out from the transport equation, a simplifying procedure that has been, in fact, applied by the 

authors of the works being reviewed in this section. Although these authors state that the 

reason for neglecting the pressure gradient is because it is vanishing small, the actual motive 

is that by dropping this term analytical solutions become possible. However, the pressure 

gradient cannot be disregarded if chemical reactions take place (see §§3.6 and §§A.5), 

otherwise mass conservation is violated and the physical consistency of the problem being 

modeled is lost
[ 212, 214]

. 

According to DGM, Eq. (4.11a) and (4.11b) are meant to include two flux contributions: 

a diffusive flux and a “viscous flux”. The diffusive contribution consists of two terms; free 

molecular or Knudsen “diffusion” (associated with the terms   
   and   

  ); and a “continuum 

part”. For the experimental case under study, Virkar and cowers assumed that   
   and 

  
      

   , and thus both    and    can be replaced by    
   . That is, both    and    

approach    
    (the effective binary diffusion coefficient) as    |    1 and    |    0. Thus, 

the main contribution to the total flux becomes pure “continuum diffusion”, in the words of that 

authors. Thus, their analysis is based on the assumption that the dominant contribution to gas 

transport through the porous electrodes is by mutual diffusion. The effective binary diffusivity 

(   
   ) is given by the binary diffusivity (   ), which is multiplied by the effective porosity ( ) and 

divided by the tortuosity factor
2
 (  )

[ 262]
. On the cathode side,     refers to the binary diffusion 

coefficient for a mixture of oxygen (  ) and nitrogen (  ). On the anode side,     is that for a 

mixture of hydrogen (  ) and steam (   ). The authors assumed that the dependence of 

binary diffusion coefficient on temperature is not very strong
3
 (     

  ? ) and this 

dependence may be accounted for using a model based on the theory of Chapman-Enskogg
[ 

263, 264]
. 

                                                      
2
 The tortuosity factor    is not to be confused with tortuosity   [e.g., see [ 262]):   =  

 . 
 

3
 This is not completely correct for polar modules such as     (e.g., see [ 264, 33]), especially at high 

temperatures ( 700°C) . 



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 132 
 

In the case of an anode with only    and     (with the partial pressure of    at the 

anode/electrolyte interface being relatively much lower and thus neglected), and for a fixed 

total pressure (   0), Eq. (4.11a) and (4.11b) reduce to 

 ?? 2 = ?
       

   
 

   2    2  ???? (4.13a) 

 

 ?? 2 = ?
       

   
 

   2    2   ???? (4.13b) 

 

Where    =   2  2 . Kim et al.
[ 82]

 made a further simplification in the lines of what was briefly 

described in §§4.3.1: the model disregards the details of what happens within the active layer, 

which is approximated by an effective zero-thickness model, that is, there is the assumption of 

a zero-dimensional surface reaction at the electrode/electrolyte interface. This heterogeneous 

reaction is considered via the following boundary condition, at steady-state (see also Eq. 3.55): 

| ?? 2| = | ?? 2 | = 2 | ?? 2| =
 

   
  , at  = 0 (4.14) 

 

From this equation, one also has that  ?? 2   ?? 2 =  ??? = 0. Moreover, if the microstructure of 

porous electrode is not a function of position and     is composition-independent, then, after 

integrating Eq. (4.13a) and (4.13b), the partial pressures of hydrogen (  2    ) and water vapor 

(  2     ) at the anode/electrolyte interface are given by  

  2  = 0 =   2

2         
   (4.15b) 

 

Alternatively, Kim et al. assumed that both the porosity and the tortuosity are functions of 

position, but     is composition-independent, and then defined an effective anode 

microstructural multiplier as 

   =
?

    (4.16) 

 

    is, based on the “First Mean Value Theorem”, the average value of    
    ?  on [0,    ]. The 

corresponding partial pressures at the electrolyte/electrode interface and the effective binary 

diffusion coefficient for the anode are now rewritten as: 

  2    =   2
    ?       (4.17a) 

 

  2     =   2

 (4.18) 

 

On the cathode side, the flux of nitrogen is zero. Thus, (4.11a) and (4.11b) for a fixed 

total pressure reduce to 

 ?? 2 = ?
       

   
 

   2    2  ?? 2 (4.19) 

 

For a cathode thickness of     with spatially invariant porosity and tortuosity, the partial 

pressure of oxygen at the cathode/electrolyte interface is given by, after integrating Eq. (4.19) 

  2  = 0 =   2
   

=   2    =  ? ( ?   2
    ) exp (

?     
     

4          
  ) (4.20) 

 

For a small cathode thickness, i.e.      ?     
  4            ? , the argument in the 

exponential is much less than one. Thus, expanding the exponential term and retaining only 

the first two terms, one obtains a simplified formula: 

  2       2
    ? (

 ?   2
    

 
)
?     

     
4

And applying the same rationale as in Eq. (4.16) and (4.17)

 (4.24) 

 

Finally, substituting for the various interface partial pressures in Eq. (2.37) and (2.38), and 

using Eq. (2.27) yields
4
 the first form of the       vs.   curve: 

        =

Apparently, there is a relevant inconsistency in “Eq. 26” of Kim et al., pp. 73 in [ 82]. Here their result was 

modified. See APPENDIX A for further details.

[ 82]

However, in the work of Kim et al.

,     and     were treated simply as empirical 

constants, fitted from experimental data using various       vs.   curves (see Table 4.1). The 

authors also used the above equations in order to study the shape of the       vs.   curves 

(e.g., by evaluating the sign of the second order derivative,          
 ? ). They have identified 

characteristic regions of nonlinear concave-up curvature (         
 ?  0) at low current 

densities, and convex-up curvature (         
 ?  0) at higher current densities. They noted, 

however, that the eventual transition from an initial concave-up curvature (at low current 

densities) to a convex-up curvature (at higher current densities), depends on the relative 

importance of the activation polarization and concentration polarization. They finally concluded 

that, in anode-supported cells, a significant contribution may well arise from concentration 

polarization resulting from the resistance to gas transport through thick porous electrodes.

In their latter papers Virkar and coworkers apply, essentially, the same mathematical 

formalism as described in the preceding pages (that is, on what strictly concerns the topic of 

concentration polarization). In studying the fuel composition and diluent effect on gas transport 

of anode-supported SOFCs
[ 259]

, they modifed Eq. (4.13) to include an additional gas

their previous work). They evaluated the effect of various parameters on cell performance, 

namely: electrolyte thickness, interlayer thickness, support thickness, and support porosity. In 

this work, however, the authors did not apply the concept of liming current. Instead, they have 

calculated the concentration polarization by using gas partial pressures directly in Eq. (2.37)-

(2.38). The partial pressures at the electrode/electrolyte interface were calculated using a 

modified model that accounts for the additional layer. For instance, the hydrogen partial

A number of other authors have been adopting a similar macroscopic approach to the 

presented above. Gopalan and coworkers
[ 266]

 used the same concentration polarization model 

to evaluate the polarization on single-step co-fired SOFCs and to support the analysis
[ 267]

 of 

“out-of-cell” measurements of   –      effective binary diffusivity in the porous anodes, at 

different temperatures. Chan et al.
[ 268]

 has applied a very similar model in order to study the 

polarization sensitivity to the change of cell component thickness. Among the minor 

differences, the latter author did not simplify Eq. (4.20), i.e., the exponential term was kept as it 

is. Using a canonical Fick diffusion equation, Huang
[ 134]

 has derived theoretical expressions 

accounting for the gas diffusion in a tubular cathode (i.e., using a cylindrical coordinate 

system), including an equation for the limiting current density, based on the same assumption 

from Virkar and other authors that, at this current level, the interfacial partial pressure o f the 



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 137 
 

reacting gas reaches zero. Aguiar et al.
[ 269]

 used Eq. (4.15a), (4.15b), and (4.20) in the 

simulation of a    -fueled planar SOFC (stack) with direct internal reforming.  Here, the 

authors considered all reforming reactions to occur before the SOFC electrode.  

There are works in the literature that have also considered, at least in part, the 

analytical models originally derived by Virkar and coauthors, but they introduced a number of 

noteworthy modifications. Among these works, there exist those
[ 270, 271, 272, 273]

 that have set 

out, more properly, reviews about the available models on gas diffusion and diffusivity 

measurement in porous electrodes of SOFCs. All of them perform some level of critical 

analysis by comparing alternative mass transfer models, for instance: traditional Fick model; 

modified Fick model (MFM); canonical Maxwell-Stefan (MSM) model; modified MSM; and 

DGM, among others. Finally, there are works that have discussed specific features (e.g., 

limitations) of the effective porous diffusion model (EPDM) developed by Virkar and coauthors, 

proposing modifications and/or extensions. Some of these works are briefly considered in the 

following paragraphs. 

Schmidt and Tsai
[ 135]

 criticize commonly made approximations in diffusion equations, 

such as uniform total gas pressure within the anode and the assumption of zero feed gas 

concentration at the anode–electrolyte interface, under current saturation condition. The 

authors propose a method to eliminate the latter approximation, and by doing so they claim 

that physically reasonable values of tortuosity are now obtained, even at low current limit. With 

their semi-analytical model (a transcendental algebraic equation), tortuosity values can be 

found from saturation currents, or vice-versa. 

In order to study the effect of pressure gradient on mass transfer in an SOFC anode, 

Grigoruk and Kasilova
[ 274]

 have developed a simplified, one-dimensional mass transport model 

based on DGM, for which an analytic solution is obtained in the case wherein the fuel is not 

diluted by an inert component (they consider a two-component gas mixture). In essence, this 

model is akin to that of Virkar and coworkers, with the exception that in Eq. (4.11a) and (4.11b) 

the simplifying conditions    |    1 and    |    0 are not aprioristic assumed. However, 

Grigoruk and Kasilova have also neglected the pressure gradient in the derivation of their 

mathematical model and thus the claims of these authors are constructed based on 

comparisons with the numerical solution of the “complete” DGM equations. Part of their model 

development is, therefore, based on misleading assumptions steaming from the errors of 

DGM. 

Brus et al.
[ 275]

 estimated the tortuosity for SOFC anodes using an EPDM-based model 

and saturation (limiting) current densities as a fitting parameter. They compared the results 

from this mass transfer model with tortuosity values obtained through an alternative method, 



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 138 
 

which applied the structural analysis of a “real” three-dimensional sample micro-structure, 

reconstructed using a combination of scanning electron microscope and focus ion beam milling 

(FIB-SEM). Their work indicates that the EPDM has significant limitations in estimating 

tortuosity values for anodes running far from the current saturation condition. According to the 

authors, in this condition the model requires relatively thick anode and very low concentration 

of hydrogen (e.g., high fuel utilization), and hence can only be used for raw estimation of 

tortuosity values. They claim that the main reason for the overestimation of tortuosity is the 

assumption of zero hydrogen partial pressure at the electrode/electrolyte interface. 

Bao et al.
[ 276]

 have developed a macroscopic model for synthesis gas (syngas) fueled 

SOFC anodes, including an analytical model for   /   electrochemical co-oxidation. They 

used an analytical approximation
[ 277]

 to describe charge and mass transfer as decoupled 

processes, which can provide analytical profiles of both voltage losses and gas species 

concentration along the anode thickness. In these analytical approximations, the molar fraction 

of feed gas is shown to be explicitly dependent on electrochemical variables. Their paper also 

provided verification of modeling results with experimental measurements (see Fig. 4.3), based 

on which the model has shown good correlation at high fuel utilization, when keeping a fixed 

porosity/tortuosity ratio. Differently from Virkar and coworkers
[ 82]

 who have estimated the 

limiting current density at the low inlet fuel concentration (20%   ), Bao et al.
[ 276]

 have Instead 

estimated the limiting current density at high inlet fuel concentration (97% and 85%   ).

 implemented a distinct approach in comparison to the ones 

presented above. In this work, the goal of these authors was not to study the electrochemical 

performance of the SOFC, but to characterize the influence of mass transfer limitations in the 

methane reforming reactivity within a   -    anode as a function of the anode thickness. 

Much like as in a “thought experiment” where only the anode is included in the experimental 

“cell” (e.g., see similar work in [ 279]). The authors investigated structural properties of SOFC 

anodes through gas adsorption, diffusion, and permeation measurements, using a modified 

Wicke–Kallenbach diffusion cell
[ 280]

. More precisely, they applied the mean transport pore 

model (MTPM)
[ 281]

 to correlate the measured permeation (     
  ) with the mean transport 

pore radius (?  ?) and the ratio of porosity ( ) to tortuosity ( ), according to Eq. (4.38). In a latter 

paper
[ 282]

 these authors studied a complete single-cell, applying the same MTPM model and 

once again focusing on the gas transport and methane reforming reactions in SOFC anodes.

. 

More recently, an EPDM-based model was developed to account for the gas leak 

diffusion-induced polarization
[ 283]

, especially for ?-SOFCs that suffer from problems related to 

non-tight electrolytes. These authors have investigated, on theoretical grounds, the gas leak 

through “microstructural flaws” (cracks and pinholes) of thin electrolytes and its effects on 

concentration polarization for both anodes and cathodes. They derived algebraic expressions 

for the evaluation of limiting current densities and concentration polarizations, which are similar 

in spirit and purpose to Eq. (4.31), (4.32), and (4.34). 

In short, the models reviewed in this section employ some degree of parametric 

modeling through analytical solutions of governing and constitutive equations. They aim the 

obtainment of accurate expressions that relate the gas-phase composition at the fuel and air 

channels with the composition at the three-phase-boundary, where all important 

electrochemical phenomena take place. The virtue of these models are that they apply a 

macroscopic approach befitting the spatial and time resolution of the available experimental 

information, thus without introducing unnecessary (often obscure) level of sophistication into 

the mathematical models. 

 



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 140 
 

 

In §§1.4.2 it was described what are the main features of a multiscale approach
[ 1, 2]

 and 

to what extent this approach is necessary in order to accurately represent the performance of 

all components of a SOFC. More specifically, multiscale modeling is often needed in those 

problems where single-scale models are incapable of making spatio-temporal resolved 

assessments of the complex interplay of competing, physicochemical microscopic processes. 

That is, when the interaction of physicochemical processes on “fine-scales” leads to significant 

spatial and time heterogeneities in the state variables of interest, ultimately affecting 

phenomena at “coarse-scales”. Furthermore, these heterogeneities happen to be very difficult 

(or even impossible) to model “on average” on this “coarse-scale”. Thus, the proper resolution 

of two or more dissimilar scales at which those processes take place becomes pivotal in 

selecting a modeling technique(s). In this sense, models to be described in this section are 

considered applicable to problems in which, supposedly, the “macro-averaging” of the details 

of an underlying microscopic world is still valid or accurate enough. Before proceeding to the 

review of the so-called macro-homogenous models, it is important to dedicate few words to 

what is meant when one conveniently labels a model as “single-scale” or “multiscale”
[ 40]

. Some 

words of Fish
[ 155]

 are given in this direction: 
 

(…) Equations can be classified into two categories: those that directly follow from physical laws 

and those that do not. A constitutive equation demonstrates a relation between two physical 

quantities that is specific to a material or substance and does not follow directly from physical 

laws. It can be combined with other equations to solve specific physical problems. (…) 

Phenomenological modeling relates several different empirical observations of phenomena to 

each other in a way that is consistent with fundamental theory but is not directly derived from it. 

(…) An alternative to phenomenological modeling is to derive constitutive equations (or directly, 

field quantities) from finer scale(s) where established laws of physics are believed to be better 

understood. The enormous gains that can be accrued by this so-called multiscale approach 

have been reported in numerous articles.  ([ 155], pp. 1-2) ? this author's emphasis in bold 

letters. 
 

Therefore, one could say that even if all governing equations (“physical laws”) describe 

processes on a single-scale, if constitutive equations (or “constitutive laws”
5
) and constitutive 

parameters are obtained from other scales (not necessarily from finer scales, even though this 

is often the case), one may refer to this combination as a multiscale approach. Under the 

                                                      
5
Term originally coined by Walter Noll [ 419]. One could label all that one does not fundamentally know about a 

boundary value problem as a “constitutive law”, though this may result in ambiguity. 



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 141 
 

definition above, however, there is a fair dose of subjectivity in classifying a model as “single -

scale” or “multiscale”. Firstly, because it is not the governing equations what that necessary 

need to be solved on multiple scales so that the approach can be called multiscale; secondly, 

phenomenological constitutive equations are not necessarily macroscopic-based derivations; 

on certain cases, one can derive phenomenological equations on finer scales as well and 

apply them (“upscaled”) on coarser scales. In other words, it is not the fact that a constitutive 

equation is eventually based upon empirical (or numerical) observations of phenomena that 

makes it “non-multiscale”. One concrete example is that of phenomenological chemical 

kinetics (mean-field approximation) that employs Arrhenius-like exponential formulas: 

parameters in these formulas can be derived, for instance, from either macroscopic or 

microscopic experiments, or even from “microscopic theories” such as UBI-QEP or DFT
[ 93]

. In 

the latter case, does it make the modeling technique a multiscale approach? Certainly, there is 

a nuance in answering this question that depends on personal views/biases. 

In this dissertation, specifically, gas-phase phenomena are the focus. Thus, the terms 

“single-scale” or “multiscale” will refer only to these phenomena, even if a work from the 

literature may have applied multiscale techniques to other coexistent physicochemical 

processes (e.g., electrochemistry) in the same analysis. Thus, for gas-phase phenomena, 

either governing equations or constitutive relations must have been derived considering 

information from more than one physical scale in order to be classified as multiscale. Another 

example: if transport parameters such as porosity and tortuosity (or equivalently, the effective 

diffusivity) are obtained via mesoscale models, e.g. Lattice-Boltzmann Method (LBM), on a real 

porous microstructure, but afterwards macroscopic continuum equations such as Eq. (4.13a) 

are used, herein this technique will be referred to as multiscale. On the other hand, if the same 

parameters are obtained from the literature or by “best-fitting” their values from macroscopic 

experiment data, here this technique will be referred to as single-scale. Furthermore, just 

because macroscale-continuum equations may eventually describe simultaneous processes 

that have different length and time scales (quite common in chemically reacting systems with 

short-lived, intermediate chemical species), this does not make the technique multiscale (just 

the problem being tacked). The assertion remains true if more equations are added to take into 

account adsorption phenomenon, but they are all solved on the same macroscopic scale. As 

alluded to above, however, this classification is subjective and reflects the way in which the 

author decided to organize this monograph. 

In the SOFC literature, most of the publications on the subject of numerical simulations 

are those that use single-scale, macro-homogeneous models of porous layers. The number is 

indeed overwhelming when compared to other modeling approaches. Without ascertaining the 



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 142 
 

reasons for that, it is probable that macro-homogeneous models have been the best available 

“benefit-cost” solution until recent days. It was said “until recent days” because existing 

research paradigms are now changing vigorously due to the flourishing of applied 

nanosciences. For instance: access to high performance computing; greater dissemination 

(and consolidation) of novel multiscale modeling techniques; further development of 

computational material sciences in response to the need to “design on the nanoscale”; and so 

forth, are factors driving several researchers towards alternative modeling approaches. As for 

many things, there is no “one-size-fits-all” solution and as necessities and/or requirements 

change, solutions will get more diverse, more complex. Thus, at least two trends are likely to 

unfold: (i) the macro-homogeneous approach will share space with other distinct approaches; 

and (ii) the macro-homogeneous approach itself will get more complex; it will ameliorate due to 

the demands of a better description of the microscopic world. Certainly, this approach will not 

disappear. 

Having said that the number of publications is enormous, it would be impossible to 

perform an encompassing review of all works that have been using a macro-homogeneous 

approach to model SOFCs. Thus, this work describes a selection of mathematical models that 

may well represent the class of macro-homogeneous models for SOFCs; more precisely those 

concerning gas-phase phenomena and the effects related to concentrations polarization. 

There is, however, a complicating factor that can make the discussion of some models difficult. 

Several independent research groups re-develop pre-existing models from the literature, by 

including modifications to the previous model. As the implementation of the previous model 

(i.e., its computational source code) is not available to new researchers, these mathematical 

models are very seldom compared to each other, thereby making it impossible to assess the 

significance of the proposed modifications. Furthermore, most mathematical models in the 

SOFC literature do not follow thorough validation processes (e.g., get verified by third-parties). 

 

 

 
The expression “macro-homogeneity of field equations in an inhomogeneous 

continuum” conveys at least two important assumptions. The first is that the equations being 

solved disregard the microscopic details of SOFC porous layers. More precisely, constitutive 

equations perform an incomplete description of the real complex, inhomogeneous pore 

structure, whose properties (geometric and others) are now described in a zero-dimensional 

space (i.e., homogeneous). Of course, one hopes that this approach sill allows capturing the 

macroscale behavior, that is, according to certain transformations it will preserve macroscopic 



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 143 
 

properties. The second meaning is that the (undoubtedly discrete) porous medium is now 

considered as a “new continuum”, interpenetrated with the continuum of the gas-phase. Thus, 

not only thermodynamic and transport properties of the porous material are lumped because of 

the homogenous assumption, but they are “homogenized” together with those of gas species. 

To be sure, this makes one wonders about what are the practical consequences of this 

“loss of information”, besides losing spatial resolution and ignoring the fluctuating part of the 

fields of state variables. These issues will not be addressed herein; nevertheless, at this point 

some considerations are highlighted so to emphasize the limits and critical features of macro-

homogeneous models
[ 67, 155, 284, 205]

: 

? Although on the microscopic scale there is a “well-defined” interface (whose 

geometry is very complex) between the gas and pore-wall, in order to obtain 

results of practical significance the macro-homogeneous model only describes the 

macroscopic features of a porous electrode. That is, the model should represent 

some suitable average over the random and complicated microscopic geometry of 

the porous electrode and this representation should be reasonably accurate on 

the macroscale. 
 

? Superficial current densities and species fluxes must be corrected for the specific 

interfacial areas (  ) involved, or for the TPB specific length (    ), in order to 

correctly evaluate the current density or flux at a particular phase boundary. 
 

? One should expect macro-homogeneous models to fail when a length 

characteristic of the microstructure (e.g., pore radii) becomes comparable to a 

length characteristic of the macrostructure size of the electrode (e.g., its thickness 

or, alternatively, the reaction penetration depth). 
 

? Macro-homogeneous models often consider that there is no actual variation of 

gas concentration across the pore diameter. This variation is usually neither 

explicitly described nor accounted for at all. 
 

? The characteristic time for gas-phase diffusion, e.g. (    ? ? )
 

   
   ? , is usually 

assumed to be far more than the characteristic time for charging the double-layer 

capacity, e.g. the ratio    
             ?   1. This ratio is expected to be greater 

than one for very high interfacial areas and low ionic conductivities. In HT-SOFC 

electrodes, the double-layer relaxation time is in the range
[ 8]

 of 10?  to 10?     . 
 

Based on the following review one should apprehend how, within the limits of a macro-

homogeneous approach, each model delineates its constitutive equations and parameters. 

This aspect is what will, for the most part, differentiate one model from another. A n additional 

differentiation criterion is whether a multiphysics approach is used or not, e.g., if gas-phase 

macro-homogeneous equations are coupled to chemical kinetics and/or to charge transport.

Ferguson et al.
[ 285]

 developed one of the earliest three-dimensional numerical 

simulations of SOFCs, using macro-homogeneous partial-differential equations.  Their 

numerical code was able to perform the computation of the local distributions of the electric 

potential, temperature, and concentration of the chemical species, in order to show the 

behavior of these distributions when certain parameters (e.g., geometry of the cell, electrolyte 

materials, and temperature in the channels) are varied. The authors studied natural gas-fed 

and hydrogen-fed SOFCs under stationary regime, for different unit cell designs, such as 

planar, tubular, and cylindrical geometries. For the planar concept, specifically, they have also 

considered three alternative configurations, namely co-flow, counter-flow, and cross-flow gas 

channel arrangements. The aim of their work was, besides the development of the numerical 

code and its validation with experimental data, to compare the cell efficiency for the cases of 

parallel (co-flow) and cross-flow designs; and then to assess the influence of the electrode 

thickness on cell efficiency. Differently from previously published works, Ferguson and 

coauthors
[ 285]

 have modeled the spatial variation of the cell variables within the unit cell (PEN 

sandwich) itself, whereas in other prior works the stack was modeled assuming the solid 

materials to be all at the same temperature and the current density being computed by 

averaging the conductivities of the various cell components. Ferguson and coauthors were 

pioneers in building a two-dimensional model for the cell cross-section (which amounts to a 

three-dimensional model globally). Modeling equations, boundary conditions, and a number of 

remarks/assumptions are presented in Table 4.2.

Assumptions and Remarks

ii. The electrochemical reactions are assumed to occur at the anode/electrolyte and cathode/electrolyte 
interfaces (i.e. heterogeneous reactions are modeled through boundary conditions). 

 

iii. The conservation of electrons was written at the interfaces where the electrochemical reactions occur 
and the mass flux is related to the electric current by Faraday's law. 

 

iv. The electric potential is continuous throughout the solid parts, except at the electrode/electrolyte 
interfaces, where electrochemical reactions occur. Potential jumps were modeled using Nernst equation. 
 

v. It was assumed that no chemical reactions occur within the air channel. 
 

vi. Reforming and water-shift reactions were assumed to occur within the fuel channel and anode domains. 
 

vii. In the porous media (i.e., cathode and anode), the molar fluxes were assumed to satisfy a type of “Fick's 
law” of diffusion for a gas mixture (“multicomponent mixture extension of Fick’s law”).

viii. It was assumed that in the gas channels the molar flux is mainly convective in the flow direction (Eq. 

[4.39e]). Diffusive mass exchange at the boundaries with electrodes where taken into account using a 
mass-transfer coefficient. However, no additional information was provided by Ferguson et al.

 on 

how this was actually accomplished. 
 

ix. The volumetric source term  ? ,  is made up of two terms,  ?   and  ?  , which are the rates of reaction of 

water gas-shift (WGS) and methane reforming reactions, respectively;   ,   and   ,   are the net 

stoichiometric coefficients of the species   in question in WGS and reforming reactions, respectively 
(positive for products, negative for reactants). 

 
One can verify that in the species mass transport equations the nature of the porous 

medium is completely absent. The single possible “vestige” that could indicate that a porous 

medium is being modeled is the constitutive parameter   ,    in Eq. (4.39d). Nonetheless, 

Ferguson and coauthors do not provide any information concerning this parameter, beyond 

saying that it is “the diffusion coefficient of the  -th species in the considered mixture” (see pp. 

112 in [ 285]). Most likely, this parameter was fitted from experimental data, although   ,    

values were not made available in their paper. Furthermore, the physical definition of the total 

molar flux  ???  in Eq. (4.39d) is unknown, e.g., is it a cross-section averaged, superficial flux 

calculated based on the fraction of open area of porous medium?  Or is it the flux associated 

with the “bulk” flow within the pore space?  

The model by Ferguson et al. serves the purpose of introducing one important aspect 

that this dissertation tries to address: that in the SOFC literature, quite frequently, no matter 

how simple or how complex, either consistent or erroneous a model may be, experimental data 

are always, seemingly, verified. For example, if a model has an awkwardly large number of 

adjustable parameters, the likelihood that this model will match empirical observations is 

potentially high, even though it is revealed afterwards that these fitted parameters are 

disproved of physical meaning (i.e., they are “fudge factors”). When attributing “unphysical” 

values to those adjustable parameters only shows that the model is able to represent 

experimental data, much like a 4th order polynomial fitting-formula would. Although the 

presence of a “large number of adjustable parameters” is an expected characteristic of macro-

homogeneous models, when a number of works in the literature allegedly capture “quasi-

microscopic” features of SOFCs electrodes using these “crude models”, then the underlying 

reason for this successful accomplishment is not clear
[ 58]

.

Yakabe et al.
[ 286]

 developed a mathematical model to simulate an anode-supported 

planar (counter-flow design) SOFC. Concerning the concentration polarization, they have 

simulated the three-dimensional distribution of the gaseous species for binary systems 

(  –     and   –    ) and also for  multicomponent mixtures. In this latter case, the model 

has considered the use of steam-reformed methane as fuel, for which the concentration 

polarization, at high fuel utilization, was estimated. In order to model flow phenomena, t he 

authors assumed the validity of Darcy’s Law in the porous medium (to account for the “viscous 

flow” parcel and also to define a constitutive equation for the pressure gradient term) and that 

reactant species are transported to the electrolyte/anode interface mainly by mass diffusion. 

As it seems, their analysis of multicomponent diffusive transport
[ 287, 288]

 is based on certain 

results derived from parallel pore models
[ 289, 290, 213]

, which by their turn rely on a number of 

assumptions made in the earlier versions of DGM developed by Evans and Manson
[ 291]

 for 

binary gas systems. Table 4.3 includes information on the mathematical model used by 

Yakabe and coauthors. However, it should be noted already that they have provided scarce 

description about their actual CFD model (e.g., there are no explicit references to governing 

and constitutive equations, source terms, and boundary conditions).

Assumptions and Remarks 

 i. It appears that in their model the electrochemical reactions were also assumed to occur at the 
anode/electrolyte interface (i.e. heterogeneous reactions are modeled through boundary conditions). 
 

ii. According to the authors, concentration polarization was calculated using Eq. (4.40e) for “half of the one 
repeating unit in the center part of the one-cell stack” (see “Fig. 1” in their paper). 
 

iii. The cell operating temperature in the model was set to 750    and fuel utilization to 85%. 
 

iv. In Eq. (4.40e)    2    
     is the partial pressure of    in the bulk of air stream, and   2    

   
 is the partial 

pressure of oxygen at electrolyte/anode interface. Equation (4.40e) appears to be based on Wagner 
equation for the electromotive force of a galvanic cell, which has a mixed ionic-electronic conductor

[ 69]
. 

 

v. According to the authors, the experimentally measured concentration polarization (used for comparison 
purposes) was the average value over the anode (integral value over its length and thickness). 

 

Yakabe and coauthors have used Eq. (4.40a) as a statement of “Darcy’s Law”, however 

its role in the actual modeling scheme is not clear, in the sense that this equation requires 

additional information (e.g., boundary value information, prescribed values within the physical 

domain, other sub-constitutive equations, and so forth) in order to have complete physical 

significance. As it is, one has both the pressure gradient    and superficial velocity    as 

unknown values. For example, a possible coupling possibility between modeling equations 

would be 

 ???? = ?     
               ??  (4.41) 

 

Even though often used in the literature, Eq. (4.41)  is not strictly correct in the 

presence of Knudsen or “frictional” flow
[ 211, 284]

. Moreover, this formulation can lead to serious 

inconsistences concerning the velocity (or rather, inertial) frame of reference. Equations 

(4.40b) and (4.40d) also present some problems. The former is a known result from DGM valid 

for isobaric counter-diffusion (hence, in this case the total pressure should be strictly uniform). 

Thus, it is not clear in which way the authors had intended to match this equation with “Darcy’s 

Law”, which considers the total pressure to vary spatially within the porous electrode. Equation 

(4.40d) possesses, on the other hand, problems to enforce mass conservativity because it 

applies a non-conservative form of diffusive fluxes
[ 211, 292, 303]

. Finally, the use of Eq. (4.40e) to 

quantify the concentration polarization is at least controversial to whether it can be used to 

evaluate concentration losses directly. This equation really expresses the total EMF of the 

SOFC as expressed by, say, the Wagner equation, in that the SOFC is considered to be an

[ 109]

. Yakabe and coauthors, in order to understand the effects of the 

gas composition and anode structure on the concentration polarization, they have compared 

the calculated concentration polarizations       to that of a reference case      ,0 (see Fig. 

4.4), where      ,0 is the concentration polarization at the ratio   2 (  2    2 )? = 0.8 for a 

gas mixture present in the fuel channel (ternary   –    –    system). That is, in order to keep 

the open-circuit voltage constant, the ratio   2   2 ?  was fixed at 0.8 0.2? , and the    

concentration in the fuel channel was modified by diluting      ?   with   .

Thus, one sees that everything comes down to obtaining values of

et al. have not made available the information on how  
 2    
   

 would have been theoretically 

calculated nor supposedly measured (in their paper, the authors compare the calculated 

concentration polarizations for the   –    –    system with experimentally measured values). 

Furthermore, in Eq. (4.42) they must have assumed that other voltage losses (e.g., ohmic and 

activation polarizations), under the same net current density, remain invariant with respect to 

the dilution of      ?  with    (effectively, to a reduction in the concentrations of    and    ).

One can only speculate that what they actually did was only to measure       in 

conditions of distinct compositions and then compare results. In another study, 

Suwanwarangkul et al.
[ 270]

 made use of the experimental values from Yakabe et al. in order to 

compare different mass transfer models in SOFCs, but applying the usual definition of      , 

e.g. according to Eq. (2.37).  

 

Ackmann et al.
[ 293]

 have presented a two-dimensional mathematical model to evaluate 

the diffusive mass transport in the porous structure of thick planar substrates, which are 

typically found in anode-supported SOFCS, using the MTPM
7
. Their aim was to examine 

operation conditions and the effect of the substrate structural parameters on the cell 

performance, for the case of SOFCs running under methane steam reforming and water-gas-

shift reactions. To justify this study, the authors have noted that, in thicker anodic substrates 

(1.5 mm thick, in their simulations), there can be severe diffusional limitations, which, as a 

consequence, might lead to a spatial separation of reforming and electrochemical reactions, 

the latter being confined to a very thin region near the anode/electrolyte interface (as 

discussed in §§2.3.3). 

These authors claim that their MTPM implementation has several advantages over that 

of Yakabe et al.
[ 286]

 who used the parallel pore model (PPM). Among the claims, they state 

that in the MTPM both the permeability and diffusion coefficients are calculated from structural 

parameters of real porous materials, all of which can be determined directly by permeatio n and 

diffusion experiments in Wicke-Kallenbach cells. While it is eminently true that the mentioned 

structural parameters (e.g., tortuosity, porosity, and pore radii) can indeed be experimentally 

measured with support of MTPM, accepting such statement as an advantage is a flagrant 

misrepresentation. Firstly, because these parameters can also be measured using diffusion 

experiments in porous solids with the aid of PPM (there is a wealthy number of examples 

where this has been done
[ 287, 294, 289, 290, 213]

). Secondly, because in their physical substance 

both MTPM and PPM are "two sides of the same coin", that is, they are really modified 

Maxwell-Stefan models with their roots on the derivations due to Mason and Evans
[ 291, 63]

, 

even sharing the same flaws and misleading definition of fluxes. Except for nomenclature 

personalisms (e.g., the structural factor      in the MTPM) and the constitutive Eq. [4.43g], 

their differences are immaterial, objectively speaking.

Assumptions and Remarks 

 i. The cell operating temperature in the model was set to 700 °C and cell voltage to 0.7 V. Anode and 
cathode substrate thicknesses were 1.5x10?  m and 6x10?  m, respectively. 
 

ii. The MTPM is based on the assumption that the structure of the porous medium is isotropic. The porous 
nature of the medium is represented by three structural parameters:      the ratio of porosity   to 
tortuosity   ; ?  ? the mean value of pore radii; and ?  

 ? the mean value of squared pore radii. 
 

iii. Note the mistake on the LHS of Eq. (4.40a): porosity should be multiplying these terms, and not     . 
 

iv. Equation (4.43c) (a modified Maxwell-Stefan equation) is assumed to be valid in the transition region of 
Knudsen numbers (   ), wherein both effects from free molecular diffusion (“Knudsen diffusion”) and 
hydrodynamic (“bulk”) diffusion are considered, depending on, e.g., the length scale of the pores. The 
authors have not defined how     is to be evaluated based on this length scale (see [ 281]).

Assumptions and Remarks 

 v. In Eq. (4.43f), the permeation flux density is described by Darcy’s Law. This formulation also has 
inconsistences concerning the velocity frame of reference (see [ 211, 221]). 

 

vi. In the derivation of Eq. (4.43g) there are implied assumptions regarding the rarified aspects of the flow 
and considerations on the pore geometry (see [ 281]). Apparently, this equation has a serious error in 
the last term of RHS, which is unbounded upon summation over all k gas species. Actually however, the 
error lies in the expression of Eq. (4.43f), from which the mole fraction (  ) of species k is missing, that 

is, the equation should have been written as  ???? 
    

= ?        , 
   ?  ?    . 

 

vii. In Eq. (4.43h), the terms  ?    2 ,  ?    2 , and  ?       are the rates of reaction due to electrochemical 

reduction of oxygen, oxidation of hydrogen, and oxidation of carbon monoxide, respectively. The model 
for the evaluation of these reaction rates was neither included nor described by Ackmann and 
coauthors

[ 293]
; instead these authors only mention that an “equivalent circuit model” was employed. 

 

A prominent framework of macro-homogeneous models for SOFC porous electrodes 

has been developed by H. Zhu and R. Kee (Colorado School of Mines), in cooperation with V. 

Janardhanan and O. Deutschman (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology), and with D. Goodwin 

(Caltech). Their work comprehends a wide range of topics, including: models for 

heterogeneous chemistry (e.g., direct internal reforming of primary fuels in SOFC anodes); 

quasi-elementary electrochemistry models (e.g., modified Butler-Volmer equations based on 

elementary, single-step reactions), multicomponent mass transport models, constitutive 

equations to “predict” properties of composite electrodes, among others. In the specific case of 

gas-phase mass transfer modeling, these authors are, beyond a doubt, advocators of the 

Dusty Gas Model (GDM). Part of their published works will now be presented and succinctly 

discussed. 

In one of their first papers, Zhu and Kee
[ 138]

 have furnished the basic theoretical 

formulation to be used by mathematical models in order to represent the PEN of SOFC 

systems, thereby allowing the analysis of the effects of various cell polarizations. A peculiar 

feature of this work was the proposition of an “abstract nomenclature” for chemical reactions 

and chemical species, so to maintain generality in the modeling of arbitrary gas mixtures on 

the anode and cathode sides of the PEN. This nomenclature is not novel in the chemical 

process modeling literature (more precisely, in the simulation of chemical kinetic systems 

obeying the “law of mass action”); this level of abstract nomenclature is often implemented in 

numerical codes such as CHEMKIN software
[ 139]

.  In the same work
[ 138]

, the concentration 

polarization (e.g., concentration gradients stemming from the transport/reaction of gaseous 

species within porous electrodes) was evaluated with support from the DGM. A summary of 

this model, as applied by Zhu and Kee, is presented in Table 4.5.

Assumptions and Remarks 

 i. The electrochemical reactions are assumed to occur at the anode/electrolyte and cathode/electrolyte 
interfaces (i.e. heterogeneous reactions are modeled through boundary conditions). At these interfaces, 
the total molar flux is related to the electric current by Faraday's law, as per Eq. (4.44f) and (4.44g). 
 

ii. The total molar flux is taken as zero for any inert species that does not participate in the electrochemical 
reactions (e.g., nitrogen in the cathode). 

 

iii. The main DGM equation, Eq. (4.44a), expresses an implicit relationship among the molar concentrations, 
molar fluxes, concentrations gradients, and the pressure gradient. In this equation   =   ?  ?  is the 

total molar concentration and    is a “mixture viscosity”, which depends on the mixture composition 
and temperature. 

 

iv. Note that in Eq. (4.40b), differently from Eq. (4.40c) and (4.43d), the factor 4 3?  appears. It is not clear 
whether this difference is related or not to some assumption concerning an extra “correction” due to, 
e.g., the accommodation coefficient of gas molecules on wall surfaces

[ 295]
. The canonical definition of the 

diffusivity for Knudsen flow is obtained from the self-diffusion coefficient derived from the kinetic theory 
of gases

[ 161]
, which gives    =     ? 3? , where  ?  is the mean thermal velocity of the gas. Thus, 

   =  2 3?    [8 ?      ? ]
   .  

 

v. The Kozeny–Carman relation given by Eq. (4.44d) assumes (i.e., idealizes) that the porous layer is formed 

by closely packed spherical particles
[ 49]

 with diameter  ? . 
 

 

  



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 154 
 

CONTINUATION OF TABLE 4.5 

     
vi. In order to determine the pressure gradient term, Eq. (4.44e) is used. This expression originates from the 

summation of Eq. (4.44a) over all species  , and also recognizing that the summation of the first term on 
the RHS vanishes exactly. As electrolyte interface concentrations are initially not known, an iterative 
procedure is employed to evaluate the pressure gradient, by first assuming an initial guess for the 
concentrations “  ”. Subsequently, according to the authors, the concentrations “  ” in the denominator 
of Eq. (4.44e) are then evaluated either with values taken at the gas channel interface or at the 

electrolyte interface, depending on the direction of the net molar flux ?  ????  . If this flux is toward the 
electrolyte, then “  ” are taken as the channel concentrations. Conversely, when the net flux is toward 
the channel, these concentrations are evaluated at the electrolyte interface. Once the pressure gradient 
has been determined, concentration gradients can now be obtained from Eq. (4.44a). Zhu and Kee

[ 138] 

propose to assume linear profiles of pressure and concentrations along the electrode thickness, thereby 
simplifying the analysis. Thus, by assuming linear concentration profiles and a known layer thickness, 
concentration gradients are evaluated and a new estimate for the concentrations at the TPB can be 
found. With new estimated gas concentrations, a new pressure gradient can be calculated. The Iteration 
proceeds until satisfactory convergence is achieved. 

 
 

In a next paper, Zhu, Kee, and coauthors
[ 83]

 have extended their previous 

computational framework for the modeling of chemically reacting flows in anode-supported 

SOFCs, considering the possibility of internal reforming of hydrocarbon fuels. The framework 

now incorporates the capability to represent elementary heterogeneous chemical kinetics in 

the form of multistep reaction mechanisms (mean-field approximation with mass-action 

kinetics). The charge-transfer chemistry is modeled through modified BVEs derived from 

elementary reactions, but assuming a single rate-limiting step. Again, concentration 

polarization is accounted for by solving the mass transport in the porous electrodes using the 

DGM. To illustrate an application for their framework, they chose a planar SOFC in which the 

fuel channel had a co-flowing architecture (“plug flow” approximation in the mean flow 

direction). However, the authors state that their theory is independent of this particular 

geometry. The internal reforming model was exemplified through the case of     steam

Assumptions and Remarks 

 i. Part of notes provided for the case of Zhu and Kee
[ 138]

 in Table 4.5 applies here as well. 
 

ii. In Eq. (4.45a) and (4.45b) the channel geometry is characterized by the cross-sectional area    and the 
perimeter    associated with the electrochemically active PEN. According to the Figure above,    

includes the width of the gas channel plus the width of the electrode. Here,  ?  is the total molar flux of 

the  -th species evaluated at the channel/anode interface, i.e.,  ? =  ?   = 0 . 
 

iii. To justify the PFR model for the fuel channel, Eq. (4.45a) and (4.45b), the authors consider the gas flow 
therein to be one-dimensional and laminar. They state that this is a good approximation because fuel 
channels typically have diameters less than a centimeter and mean velocities of less than 100 cm  . 
Thus, Reynolds number is expected to be on the order of  100. Hence the flow is highly viscous and a 
fully developed velocity profile is established very near the channel entrance (see §§4.10 for discussion). 

 

iv. In the fuel channel, the authors also neglect variations of the gas composition transverse to the flow 
direction, assuming that “rapid diffusion of species across the channel width homogenizes the 
composition transverse to the flow”. That is, they disregard any mass transfer resistance in the wall 
direction or, which is the same, the flow has no “mass boundary layer “(see §§4.10 for discussion). 

 

v. It seems to be a problem with the solution of fuel channel, if one takes into consideration the statement 
made by the authors in that the velocity   is free to vary in the channel. In this case, there are more 
unknowns than equations, i.e. the problem is under-determined (see note “i” in Table 4.8). 

 

vi. In the steady-state description of molar fluxes, Eq. (4.45c),  ? ,   is net production rate (per unit of active 

area) due to heterogeneous chemistry and     is the active catalyst area available for surface reaction per 
unit volume. The authors state that as the electrode thickness is much smaller than its length, gradients 
are primarily in the   direction (transport through the electrode is taken as approximately 1D). 

 

vii. This molar production rate  ? ,  , Eq. (4.45m), is evaluated using the proposed heterogeneous reaction 

mechanism in Zhu et al.
[ 83]

. Since this mechanism is formulated in terms of elementary reactions on the 
catalyst surface, the reaction rates depend both on the concentrations of the gaseous reactants and on 
the coverages of the surface species, the latter represented by surface sites and adsorbates. Since these 
coverages are not known a priori, they must be determined as part of the solution process. However, the 
way in that this is accomplished is not indicated in their paper. It is likely that a “pseudo-transient” 
conservation equation for surface species was added to the set of equations.  

 

viii. The authors assume that surface species are effectively immobile on length scales larger than an 
individual catalyst particle. Thus, at steady state, values of  surface coverage must be such that the net 

production rate due to chemistry is zero for every surface species (i.e.,  ? ,  = 0 when   is a surface 

species). Evidently, this is a corollary assumption within the mean-field approximation, but it does not 
mean it is a good approximation for the real problem being solved

[ 296, 132, 55]
. 

 

ix. It is important to mention that the authors assume that the DGM can be used over the full range of 
Knudsen numbers (  ): from values much larger than 1 (when molecule-wall collisions should 
dominate), to values much less than 1 (when molecule-molecule collisions should dominate). 

 

x. Differently from their previous work, here the authors propose a direct representation of  ?  as given by 
Eq. (4.45i), so to facilitate (or make more convenient) the solution of the system of equations, Eq. 
(4.45e), which must be solved simultaneously for each of the   components of [ ]. In this 
representation, the DGM diffusion coefficients (i.e., the second-order tensor     ) are represented as a 
matrix inverse [ ? ], a format often applied in the literature for Maxwell-Stefan models

[ 64, 185, 297]
.

On what concerns concentration losses, specifically, in their subsequent works
[ 31, 298, 

299, 300]
 Janardhanan, Deutschmann, and coworkers adopt the same modeling framework as 

described in the foregoing, though with some noteworthy differences. Some of them, which will 

be presented in the next pages, deserve attention in that they can help to understand a 

number of artifacts introduced by mathematical models in counterpoint to experimental 

observation. The authors applied
[ 31]

 their “generic” computational framework to study the 

specific case of an anode-supported button cell running on humidified     (3%     and air as 

the oxidant), under direct internal reforming conditions. Essentially, what differentiates this 

work from the previous ones is the use of standard finite-volume CFD techniques
8
 for solving 

mass transfer and flow-field (two-dimensional) equations in the fuel channel and porous 

electrode. Table 4.7 summarizes the modeling equations that are different in comparison to 

those of their previous work (see Table 4.6).

Assumptions and Remarks 

 i. The designation “unspecified’ points out the fact that in this paper there was no explicit indication that a 
given equation is to be employed in a specific domain (e.g., fuel channel and/or electrode). This 
information is implied solely by the form of the equation, from which ambiguity or model uncertainty 

might arise. For instance, the total velocity ( ??) vector has different meanings when in the context of pure 
fluid or porous electrode:  in the latter case, it must represent a macroscopic superficial velocity and not 
the “true velocity” of gas flow within the voids of the porous medium. Otherwise, the porosity ( ) should 
have been used to make the necessary differentiation.

Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 158 
 

CONTINUATION OF TABLE 4.7 

 
ii. Equation (4.46a) represents the continuity of the total mass of the system, in a given bounded domain. In 

principle, the source term  ? ,  in this equation should be always zero (everywhere) to ensure mass 

conservation.  However, by inspecting Eq. (4.46f) one verifies that it can be nonzero at the TPBs, wherein 

electrochemical reactions are taking place. In this case, therefore,  ? ,  really represents what is 

sometimes called a “spurious source term”, which can arise as a result of the incomplete (no-rigorous) 
description of the boundary value problem. Heterogeneous chemical reactions, on the physical scale of 
description of Eq. (4.46f), are (usually) taken into account through boundary conditions prescribed at the 
surfaces (“walls”) of the domain.  However, if, for example, the problem’s dimensionality excludes any 
description of phenomena along the spatial coordinate parallel to wall direction, then these phenomena 
may be evaluated through ad hoc “corrections”, i.e., source terms in the case of Eq. (4.46f). Thus, 

heterogeneous reactions are represented as “pseudo-homogeneous reactions” because  ? ,  is 
incorporated in the homogenous (continuum) description of the domain. Nonetheless, in the particular 
case of Janardhanan and Deutschmann model in [ 31], these authors considered a two-dimensional 
description of the problem (that includes the spatial coordinate parallel to wall direction), yet, oddly 
enough, they have kept the spurious source term. 
 

iii. Equation (4.46b) represents momentum balances (linear momentum “conservation” for a dissipative 
system). When also taking into consideration Eq. (4.46e) for electrode domains, it resembles the 
“Brinkman equation”

[ 54, 47]
. A few remarks about this equation

9
 are given here with the hope that they 

might serve for a better understanding of this modeling approach adopted by the authors.  
a. First, it is noted that the same remark made in “i” is still pertinent, that is, the absence of the 

porosity factor to clearly indicate that this equation refers to a porous domain. 
 

b. The inclusion of the term  ?  entails the same assumptions of Darcy’s Law. In fact, Eq. (4.46b) 
simplifies to Darcy’s Law in the absence of meaningful stresses and for flows with sufficiently 
low Reynolds number. Appearance of field quantities (stresses) in a macroscale equation 
which describes the flow in porous media is an interesting (and important) discussion. 
However, it should be already mentioned that the consideration of such field quantities, as in 
Eq. (4.46b), is of doubtful physical significance. 

 

c. Considering the continuity equation as given by Eq. (4.46a), the momentum Eq. (4.46b) is not 
strictly correct, because the “net mass source term” should have been added to it. 

 

d. The “coefficient of dynamic viscosity” (  ) that multiplies the stresses in Eq. (4.46b) is not the 
same as the one that appears in Eq. (4.46e), for which the authors made no distinction. These 
coefficients are different for reasons related to both the scale dependence of gas viscosity in 
porous media and to rarefication effects

[ 301, 302, 303, 199]
.  

 

iv. Equation (4.46c) is erroneous in the way it expresses material fluxes. If the pressure gradient is 

considered, DGM constitutive equations can only be written in terms of total fluxes ( ??? ) and thus never 

in terms diffusive fluxes ( ? ). Therefore, it turns out that in Eq. (4.46c) there is the double counting of 

fluxes
[ 211]

. That is,  ??? =      ??   ?  and so   (     ??)     ??? =   (2      ??   ? ). The authors have 

made the misleading assumption that  ???  can be taken as the diffusive flux in Eq. (4.46c) and Eq. (4.45i). 

 
In another study, the author’s computational framework was again used to numerically 

investigate a planar SOFC under direct internal reforming conditions
[ 298]

, but at this time the 

authors have analyzed the influences of certain operating parameters on optimal cell operation 

and aspects related to heat transfer, such as: (i) the influence of the steam-to-carbon ratio of 

                                                      
9
 For the fluid domain, on the other hand, this equation does not deserves special attention in this regard, as it is 

really the standard, steady-state “compressible” Navier-Stokes equation for the mean flow, written in the high 
Froude limit. There is, however, an “incorrect notation” concerning part of the non-deviatoric (“mean”) stress 
tensor in this equation: the second term on the RHS of Eq. (4.46b) should have been written as ? 2 3?    
[         ], where   is the second rank unit tensor.  Or, alternatively, as ? 2 3?           .

inlet fuel on the operating temperature and on the propensity to form carbonaceous solid 

deposits (within the anode); (ii) main differences between isothermal and adiabatic operational 

regimes; (iii) impact of fuel pre-reforming on cell performance, regarding the possibility to 

increase efficiency by the reutilization of waste heat. More recently
[ 300]

, the authors applied the 

same computational strategy as the above mentioned work to the analysis of mass and heat 

transport in SOFCs designed with a novel electrolyte material (proton-conducting electrolyte, in 

place of the more conventional design that uses an oxide ion-conducting material). Table 4.8 

summarizes the modeling equations that are different in comparison to their previous works 

(tables 4.6 and 4.7).

Assumptions and Remarks 

 i. Now one sees that an additional momentum balance, Eq. (4.47a), was added to the system of equations. 
This axial momentum equation was absent in their previous works (see remark “v” in Table 4.6). A short 
discussion on the origin and validity of this equation will be made in APPENDIX A. In [ 298] there is a 
typographic error in this equation, in which the parameter    is missing. 

 

ii. The authors abandoned Eq. (4.46c) in detriment of Eq. (4.47b) to describe the species mass conservation, 
thus previous errors are no longer present (see remark “iv” in Table 4.7).   
 

iii. The additional time-dependent term in Eq. (4.47a), Eq. (4.47b), and (4.47c) is added for numerical 
purposes only (under-relaxation during the convergence steps), that is, at each axial position the 
transient system of equations is solved until a steady-state (converged) solution is obtained (see 
APPENDIX A). The use of this transient form of the equations now requires computing the total density 
(  ) of the gas-phase within the porous structure. Thus, Eq. (4.47c) was incorporated to the set of 

equations (to match the number of unknowns of the problem). In this form, differently from Table 4.7, 
the porosity factor is now included. 

 

iv. In Eq. (4.47d), the Knudsen diffusivity formula was changed (corrected?) to use the “2 3? ” factor (see 
remark “iv” in Table 4.5). 

 

  



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 160 
 

In their later work
[ 304]

, Zhu, Kee, and coauthors chose an alternative approach 

(“modified Fickian diffusion model”) to that of DGM for studying the multidimensional flow 

behavior in button-cells. The aim of this study was to assess the validity of commonly made 

assumptions (e.g., uniform feed gas composition along the fuel channel/electrode interface) 

and their impact on the quantitative analysis and interpretation of button-cell experiments. For 

that the authors developed a three-dimensional CFD model of fluid, chemistry, and thermal 

transport flow (see Table 4.9). They also compared this “full” 3D model with often used one-

dimensional models to pinpoint their differences when certain simplifying assumptions are 

violated. Particularly, some topics discussed by this paper will be examined in §§4.10.

Assumptions and Remarks 

 i. See notes provided in tables 4.4 (“vii”), 2.5 (“i”, “ii”), 2.6 (“vii”, “viii”), 2.7 (“I”, “iii”), and 2.8 (“iv”). 
 

ii. Differently from Eq. (4.46b), “effective viscous stresses” were neglected in Eq. (4.48e). Inertial effects and 
viscous drag were retained though. It is not clear if the buoyancy force was, in fact, taken into 
consideration during the actual numerical simulations (i.e., if Richardson number is not vanishing small). 
 

iii. As also mentioned for the model of Yakabe et al.
[ 286]

, Eq. (4.48h) has problems to enforce mass 
conservation, because it applies a non-conservative form of diffusive fluxes

[ 305, 306, 292]
. 

 

iv. Effective mixture-averaged diffusion coefficients were evaluated using the Bosanquet formula Eq. (4.46i). 
 

v. The applied definition of diffusive flux, Eq. (4.48f) and (4.48g), has issues related to the frame of 
reference, e.g., these constitutive equations are not frame indifferent/invariant

[ 217, 218, 219]
. 

 

 



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 161 
 

Yong, Haberman, and Todd applied new approaches for modeling fluid flow and mass 

transfer in SOFCs
[ 307, 292, 308]

, which included the development of a new theoretical model for 

gas-phase transport in porous electrodes, denominated as Cylindrical Pore Interpolation Model 

(CPIM). These authors have focused on the simulation of chemically reacting gas flows in the 

porous support structure of an integrated-planar SOFC (IP-SOFC), which is based on a cell 

design pioneered by Rolls-Royce (see Table 4.10 for an illustrative scheme of this design). 

This porous structure (a reactive anode support, in terms of its main functionality) is 

impregnated with the required catalysts for the steam reforming of methane. 

Yong and Haberman have studied two simulation cases: one in which a pre-reformer 

module is employed
[ 308]

 and another in which it is not
[ 307]

; however, in both cases, the 

electrochemical cell (i.e., the SOFC) was not actually modeled, that is, electrochemical 

reactions were accounted for by prescribing fixed mass fluxes at the anode-electrolyte 

interface, which in their turn were calculated for a fixed, uniform electric current density. The 

reason for such oversimplification is, apparently, because the main interest in these studies 

was on the peculiarities of     reforming and WGS reactions. In the two case studies the 

authors employed two different mathematical models to simulate the mass transfer within the 

porous support structure (see tables 4.10 and 4.11). In their later work, which simulated the 

effect of a pre-reformer module
[ 308]

, they used the CPIM
[ 292]

.

Assumptions and Remarks 

 i. Haberman and Yong developed an in-house CFD code for solving the (two-dimensional) set of governing 
equations. The authors stated to have used a finite-volume, time-marching method for structured grids. 
Thus, the l form of governing Eq. (4.49b) and (4.49d), as actually implemented in their numerical code, 
ought to have included a transient term to account for the numerical relaxation (time march). 

 

ii. The model for the macroscopic flow within the porous structure was again the empirical Darcy equation, 
Eq. (4.49a), which describes the balance between the force from the pressure gradient    and the 
frictional resistance from the solid material. Here, however, Haberman and Yong decided to express this 

equation using the pore velocity vector  ?? , instead of the superficial velocity (volume flow rate per unit 

area through the porous structure) as has been done by the previous authors cited herein. This 

superficial velocity ( ?? ) can be obtained by multiplying  ?? , the mean velocity within a pore (cross-

section), by  . 
 

iii. In this approach, Haberman and Yong decoupled ”diffusive fluxes” from “convective fluxes”, similarly to 
what have been presented in tables 4.3, 4.4, and 4.9. According to Eq. (4.49e), the flux vector of the  -th 

species,    ?? , , is defined as the sum of "convection and diffusion fluxes”, where the mass-averaged 

pore velocity   ??  is the velocity calculated from the Darcy Eq. (4.49a).

iv. The authors included a definition for the Reynolds number, Eq. (4.49c), so to discuss the range of validity 

of Eq. (4.49a). They stated that this latter equation is valid for     1. In their paper, the maximum 

value of    was about 0.0001 and hence the use of Eq. (4.49a) would be well justified. Nevertheless, the 

Darcy equation can only describe the flow in the porous structure well away from the walls, i.e., It cannot 
model a no-slip condition at a wall nor the resulting “boundary layers”

10
. Haberman and Yong provided 

an approximate theoretical analysis is in order to estimate the likely magnitudes of these “boundary 
layers”. They have modified Eq. (4.49a) to allow calculation of the velocity boundary layers at the edges 
of the porous structure by adding the so-called “Brinkman” term to the Darcy equation, according to Eq. 
(4.49b). The normal stresses in this term were, however, ignored (see also note “iii-b” in Table 4.7). 
 

v. Diffusion mass fluxes  ?  were derived from Maxwell–Stefan relations
[ 216, 65]

, Eq. (4.49f), which were 
written in matrix form, Eq. (4.49g), for the first  ? 1 fluxes. Thus [  ] and [ ] are matrices of size 
  ? 1    3 (in a three-dimensional problem). The matrix [   ] is a square matrix of order   ? 1 . The 

first  ? 1 diffusion fluxes are determined by inverting the matrix [   ]. The  -th flux  ?  is then found 
from the condition that the diffusive fluxes must sum to zero, Eq. (4.49j). 

 

vi. Their definition of diffusive flux, Eq. (4.49f), has problems related to the adopted frame of reference (see 
also note “v” in Table 4.9). The way it has been expressed (i.e., using mole fraction gradients) is not 
coherent with the adoption of a mass-averaged velocity referential (see note “i” in Table 4.14). 

 

vii. In this work, the authors did not consider Knudsen “diffusion” in their mass transfer model. 
 

viii. Figure 4.6 shows the simulation results for the gas velocity vector   ??  in the  –  plane. The variation of 

the  -direction velocity     is shown in Fig. 4.5a and the  -direction velocity     is shown in Fig. 4.5b. 

From these figures one verifies that a net mass flux enters the porous structure at the anode interface 
( = 1 mm) and travels downward through the domain, “spreading” by a small amount in the  -
direction. Within the boundary layer adjacent to the fuel channel ( = 0),      is of a similar magnitude 

as the variations at  = 1 mm.  
 

ix. Figure 4.5c shows the simulation results for the pressure distribution within the domain. The authors 
stated that the overall pressure gradient in the  -direction is brought about by the prescribed pressure 
drop in the fuel channel (note that neither modeling equations nor physical information were given for 
the simulation of the fuel channel in this paper, besides the short discussion made at the Appendix 
section therein). They also pointed out that in order to conserve mass, the pressure increases in the 
regions adjacent to each anode, where mass enters the system. This pressure rise results in a pressure 
gradient in the  -direction which causes the spreading of the flow in the  -direction at the anode edges.

 Darcy equation cannot handle correctly situations in which Stefan velocities at wall are (substantially) different 
from those existing in the “bulk” of the homogenized porous medium. The same is true if “diffusion slip” 
phenomenon occurs in a significant way

Jin, Xue, and Xie developed CFD analyses (mainly for two-dimensional, axisymmetric 

computational domains) of multi-physicochemical processes in SOFCs and SOECs, including: 

direct internal reforming of     and     in anode-supported cells

[ 312]

; and reliability 

analysis of SOFCs wherein the coupling of chemical–mechanical phenomena develop due to 

the volumetric expansion of ceramic components, leading to the so-called chemical stresses
[ 

313]
. These authors have not used the same mathematical models of fluid flow and mass 

transfer throughout their works and important differences exist concerning the way in which 

concentration losses have been calculated. Tables 4.12, 4.13, 4.14, and 4.15 include relevant 

information for comparing these models.

Assumptions and Remarks 

 i. Equation (4.51a) allegedly represents the mass transport equation for the  -th species. This equation, 
identified by the authors as “Stefan-Maxwell transport equation”, has indeed several critical problems: 

a. Seemingly, the first term on the LHS (within the brackets) is probably what made the authors 
relate it to the Maxwell-Stefan theory; however, such nomenclature is incorrect.  Solely by the 
way in which this term has been written one cannot really assert this relation.  It may rather 
be identified with the so-called “generalized diffusion driving force”, as it became known from 
the TIP theory

[ 159, 80, 161]
, which in the case of Eq.  (4.51a) also includes the thermophoretic 

“force” (Souret effect). Moreover, the term   , 
    in this equation is in complete disagreement 

with that of the standard Maxwell-Stefan model
[ 185]

. 
 

b. The applied definition of diffusive flux has issues related to the frame of reference, e.g., this 
definition is not frame indifferent/invariant. 

 

c. The definition of diffusive flux, when taking into account Eq. (4.51e), has problems to enforce 
mass conservativity because it applies a non-conservative form of fluxes (see note “i-a”). 

 

d. The second term on the LHS is inconsistent with the description of Eq. (4.51b) because in the 
former it is implicitly assumed that the field of mean-flow velocity is constant. 

 

e. The dimension consistency of the first term on the RHS is questionable, based on the 

expression given by Eq. (4.51d), i.e., apparently  ? ,   has the dimension of m    
? cm?  

whereas Eq. (4.51a) has the dimension of     ? m? . 
 

f. The authors have informed that this equation is applied in both gas channels and porous 
domains, which is obviously a misleading statement, e.g., Eq. (4.51e) is only valid for porous 
media. 

 

ii. These authors referred to Eq. (4.51b) as the “weakly compressible Brinkman equation”. Not really sure 
why they gave such identification, as the authors have stated that this equation is to be applied in the gas 
channel (homogeneous fluid domain).  

a. The last (source?) term on the RHS (“ ”) was left unidentified/unspecified in their paper, and 
so it was the parameter    . 
 

b. The physical significance of the term  2 3?     ?     is obscure (note the use of a negative 
sign). Perhaps it alludes to the coefficient of bulk viscosity

11
. If so, in this case it is not 

reasonable to affirm that the thermodynamic pressure is not equal to the mean (mechanical) 
pressure

[ 314]
 for “weakly compressible” flows.

iii. Equation (4.51d) is the transport equation for surface species (for those participating in electrochemical 

reactions at the TPB). Distinctively from the previous works presented in this chapter, surface diffusion 
phenomenon was considered by Xie and Xue (the hypothesis of local equilibrium with 
adsorption/desorption processes is implied). A Fickian-type description has been used for the surface 

diffusion term; however, no specification (or value) was attributed to   
    . 

 

iv. No indication was given on how   
  ,   

 was calculated. Note that in Eq. (4.51e) the Knudsen diffusion 
coefficient is not multiplied by    ? , only the mutual (“bulk”) diffusion coefficient.

Assumptions and Remarks 

 i. In relation to the mass transport Eq. (4.52a), the thermodiffusion term is now absent and t the notation 

for the source term ( ? ,  ) was corrected, so to reflect a mass-based rate (    
? m? ). 

 

ii. The momentum equation, Eq. (4.52b), for the gas channel was also changed. Now it is recognized as the 
steady-state “compressible” Navier-Stokes equation for the mean flow. The continuity equation, Eq. 
(4.52a), was made explicit as well (observing that no sources terms were included in this equation). 

 

iii. The momentum equation, Eq. (4.52d), for porous electrodes was also changed. In their prior work, 
Darcy’s Law was used to describe the macroscopic flow in the porous domain; here a Brinkman-type 
equation is adopted. There is an additional “detail” in this equation: the presence of a porosity factor 
(1  ? ) in front of the second term of RHS. Although it is not possible to say that this form is “incorrect” 
(because explicit definitions for both   and    would be required

[ 301, 303]
), it certainly produces ambiguity 

between the LHS and RHS of Eq. (4.52d) with respect to whether    is a superficial velocity or not.

Assumptions and Remarks 

 i. The mass transport Eq. (4.53b) is equivalent to Eq. (4.52a), with the difference being that the former is 
expressed in terms of mass fractions and the latter in terms of mole fractions. Thus, the additional terms 
appearing in Eq. (4.53b) are due to the transformation Jacobian

[ 315, 316]
 to change from     to    . 

 

ii. It is worth noting that in the momentum Eq. (4.53e), differently from all other works presented so far, an 

“total” mass source term ( ? , ) appears, which is a direct result from the form of the continuity Eq. 

(4.53f). However, similarly to what was said in Table 4.13 (note “iii”),  ? ,  should have been divided by  
  

in Eq. (4.53e). Other authors
[ 317, 318]

 have proposed similar equations considering this mass source term.   
 

iii. Equation (4.53h) is equivalent to Eq. (4.52e). The seemingly different format is because in Eq. (4.53h) the 

average pore diameter  ?  is given in cm and hence   
   is expressed in cm   ? .  

 

iv. In Eq. (4.53i)  ? ,  is the mass source term induced by electrochemical reactions, which is related to the 

Faradaic charge transfer current density (  ). In this equation,   ,  represents the moles of electrons 
transferred per mole electroactive reactant in the  -th reaction (i.e.,   , =     ? ); and    is the molar 

mass of the electroactive reactant in the  -th reaction.

 and also the pressure gradient

ii. The authors have proposed Eq. (4.54b) as an ad hoc method to avoid the violation of gas species mass 
conservation (which, in fact, happens if    is taken as zero, as indicated in APPENDIX A). An “average” 
Bosanquet diffusion coefficient is employed

[ 72]
.  

 

 

4.5.2.7 Dong et al. 

As a final example of possible variation of the momentum equation in porous electrodes 

(i.e., specifically to macro-homogeneous models from the SOFC literature) is the inclusion of 

extra source terms that account for other frictional effects, e.g., Forchheimer term. Dong et al.
[ 

319]
 have considered such modification for the numerical (CFD) analysis of a planar anode-

supported SOFC stack (see Table 4.16 for the model equations).

 Briefly, in this dissertation the term “advection” is understood as the transport mechanism of a conserved 
property (or simply of a scalar) by a fluid due to fluid's bulk motion in relation to its virtual center of mass. In the 
literature (mainly in the CFD area), the convective flux of single fluids is usually defined as being equivalent to 
advection. Here, however, the former will be defined as the total flux of a conserved property (“diffusion plus 
advection”) in superimposed fluids. Surely, such convention is not without is controversies and it is far from being 
considered as a generally agreed convention.

4.5.2.8 Special Topics on the Modeling of Porous SOFC Layers 

There are still a large number of works in the literature devoted to, or that incorporated 

to some extent, the evaluation of concentrations polarization in SOFCs using the macro-

homogeneous approach. Nonetheless, they abide by the same mathematical models as the 

ones reviewed in this section. Thus, to not overwhelm this monograph with endless listings of 

similar models, these other works will not be appraised herein. In Table 4.17, nonetheless, 

some of these works are indicated as representative of the models that have been heretofore 

discussed.

A number of more specific topics related (directly or indirectly) to concentration-induced 

voltage losses in SOFCs have not been included (in detail) in this review, even though there 

are macro-homogeneous models in the literature that deal with these topics, as for instance: 

i. Surface-mediated diffusion (and other first-passage phenomena). 
 

ii. The influence of gas-phase equilibrium potential on electrode kinetics (for which 

some discussion was already given in §§2.3 and §§3.3). 
 

iii. Material constitutive models of composite electrodes, which are pertinent to 

evaluate transport properties and other relevant parameters. 
 

iv. The effect of the variability of modeling parameters on simulation results. 
 

 

Evidently, given that the topics listed above constitute, by themselves, a special 

thematic, the respective literature will not be scrutinized in in this dissertation.  

 

 

So far, it has not been the intent of this chapter to go into the specifics of each model 

(and this remains true for the rest of this section). Nevertheless, a number of remarks may be 

drawn at this point based on those considerations provided at the end of §§4.5.1. Most of the 

numerical simulations of SOFC in the literature, which apply the macro-homogeneous 

approach, do not perform any pre-assessment regarding the validity, physical pertinence, and 

potential limitations of their mathematical models. It appears that an “intellectual inertia” exist 

to a great extent. Not in the sense that the existing modeling approaches really represent a de 



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 171 
 

facto state of art (for which neither improvement nor corrections would be necessary), but 

rather, unfortunately, some thoughtless “establishment”. The same set of modeling equations 

(some of them with fragrant errors, as indicated in the foregoing pages) have been reused in 

different works (at times by the same authors) to simulate both the “simplest” case and the 

more complex multiphysics case, without any modification whatsoever; and there always 

seems to be fair agreement with empirical observation. The ubiquitous argument to persist with 

these approaches is therefore their seeming validation against experimental results. In some 

cases, however, their apparent success is certainly illusory. Thus illusory conclusions may be 

drawn from these “validated” results, engendering confusion and controversial perceptions.  

Considering the models reviewed in §§4.5.2, one verifies that they try to represent the 

“average features” of the random and complicated microscopic geometry of the porous 

electrode using mainly two concentrated parameters, namely porosity ( ) and tortuosity ( ). 

These parameters are, more often than not, empirically adjusted values to fit experimental 

data. That is, they are really employed as “fudge factors”. In this situation, however, one 

cannot objectively assess if the combination of these two factors does, in fact, represent a 

reasonably accurate average of the “microscopic features” on the macroscale. It can also be 

seen that, in the case of modeling equations that were presented, explicit factors accounting 

for correction of specific interfacial areas are seldom available, especially at phase boundaries  

or to differentiate the usage of transport equations in distinct physical domains (e.g., active 

layer and support substrate). Usually these factors, when available, are restricted to the 

description of electrochemical reactions “inside” rate expressions (i.e., in source terms only). 

Thus, the correction of species fluxes and superficial current densities do not occur in a 

transparent manner. In this case, the “area conversion” of a flux leaving one geometric domain 

to other neighboring domain is therefore not handled properly. 

None of the works reviewed so far has provided any comments on the ratio of the 

characteristic length of the microstructure to the length characteristic of the macrostructure 

size of porous layer. This kind of evaluation is especially critical for thin film SOFC designs 

(e.g., ?-SOFCs). Furthermore, all the models in §§4.5.2, with the exception of CPIM (Table 

4.11), seems to apply an unmindful definition of mass fluxes, which (apparently) are tacitly 

assumed to be valid averages over the pore geometrical cross-section. In other words, these 

macro-homogeneous models, besides ignoring any analysis of possible significant effects due 

to the variation of gas properties across the pore diameter, they are also unclear when defining 

if the flux is based on an apparent, averaged superficial velocity or calculated based on the 

actual velocity within the open pore volume. The importance of such coherence is not only 

semantic, but it can also impact, for instance, the definition of porous media constitutive 



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 172 
 

equations and parameters. One can say at least that there is certain sloppiness in the notation 

used by these models. Finally, about the last consideration in §§4.5.1, the issue it is not the 

fact the characteristic time for gas diffusion is not compared to that for electrically charging the 

double-layer capacity (which is usually of minor practical significance within the context of fluid 

flow and mass transfer in the gas-phase), but instead the absence of discussion about the 

many other (possible) timescales of competing physicochemical processes or relaxation 

phenomena, which might adversely hinder the validity of a chosen mathematical model (see 

§§3.6). 

 

 

 

Certainly, single-scales models are not limited to describe the macroscale. They can be 

implemented on a great range of spatial–temporal scales, encompassing many braches of 

physical-chemistry and molecular physics. In theory, single-scale models can be developed on 

the smallest physical scale one can possibly think of, but their validity are subjected to the 

limitations of a local minimum scale on which the usage of the respective “governing” 

equations is still valid. A prominent example of such wide-ranging spectrum of implementations 

is the molecular reaction dynamics
[ 332]

, which aims to provide a description of reaction 

chemistry on the fundamental scale of individual atoms and molecules. 

On what concerns solid-oxide fuel cells, specifically, existing modeling methodologies 

range from the atomistic to the system scale
[ 1, 2]

 by virtue of the fact that SOFCs are intrinsic 

multiscale systems. The reason is the necessity of focusing on an individual scale in order to 

make possible the study of complete systems (see §§1.4). Sub-macroscale modeling 

methodologies constitute a broad category of examples in the SOFC literature. In this 

dissertation, however, one is only interested in those works that have meaningful nexus to 

concentration polarization (i.e., transport phenomena within the gas-phase). This severely 

restricts the number of published works under examination, as the vast majority of them devote 

their analysis either to the understanding of surface reactions taking place at the phase 

boundaries of electrodes/electrolytes, or to solid-phase transport phenomena (e.g., membrane-

polarization processes related to charge transport).  Among the works that have pertinence to 

mass transport limitations and concentration-induced voltage losses, a significant part is 

dedicated to the mesoscale microstructural analysis and characterization of porous electrodes.  

The pertinence is justified by the fact that these works are able to provide relevant information 

on the microstructure of porous medium with high (sub-micrometer) spatial resolution, which 



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 173 
 

can be “homogenized” (e.g., through correlations or “embedded” microscale simulations) and 

subsequently used by macroscale-continuum (macro-homogeneous) modeling approaches; or, 

alternatively, they can be directly represented in the model through the so-called structure-

resolved approaches. The latter case is what will be effectively discussed in this section. The 

former case will be addressed in §§4.7 and §§4.8. 

 

 

Structure-resolved models may be “partially resolved” or “fully resolved”. Fully resolved 

models use information obtained from tridimensional
13

 (3D) reconstruction of real (or virtual) 

samples of electrodes (or porous supports), which enable one to directly probe the effects of 

electrode geometry on transport phenomena. Partially resolved models apply some family of 

theoretical methods based on idealized material models (e.g., percolation theory), which use a 

number of empirical physical characteristics as input. Partially resolved models are usually 

developed in the form of algebraic correlation formulas, making their application comparatively 

simpler. For this reason, there are works in literature that have applied fully resolved 

simulations to derive partially resolved models
[ 333, 334]

. 

The 3D reconstruction of real samples (see Table 4.18 for references) apply 

reconstruction techniques based on high-resolution imaging technologies, such as focused ion 

beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) or X-ray computed tomography (XCT). The 3D 

microstructure of electrode is virtually reconstructed in a computational field: in the FIB-SEM 

(destructive) technique, this reconstruction is done using a series of acquired 2D SEM images 

(each sequential image is obtained by gradually milling down through the electrode thickness); 

whereas in the XCT (nondestructive) technique the retrieved information is “naturally” in the 

form of 3D objects (“virtual slices” that represent cross-sections of electrode and that can be 

used directly to create a 3D virtual model). Virtualized microstructures are then quantified by 

means of mathematical analyses, which can estimate the properties of interest, such as TPB 

density, tortuosity, porosity, and volume fractions of existing phases. 

  

                                                      
13

 Two-dimensional selected regions (“thin cross-sections”) of electrodes have also been used as input 
information in numerical (2D) simulations; or to reconstruct the 3D geometry of an electrode ( e.g., as in stochastic 
reconstruction).

Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 175 
 

In order to compute effective material properties (e.g., gas effective diffusion within the 

porous matrix) the reconstructed 3D data can be used in numerical simulations as phase 

boundary information. For instance, Lattice-Boltzmann Methods (LBM) have been applied for 

this task (see Table 4.18 for references). There are also micro-modeling methods that use 

material models with minimal or no experimental data as input
[ 334, 17, 338]

. The advantage of the 

latter methods is that effective transport properties can be evaluated without resorting to 

empirical correlations or parameters fitted to experimental data. For example, these properties 

can be estimated using Monte Carlo random walk methods running on virtual electrodes, 

which were numerically constructed through sphere packing algorithms
[ 358]

. 

An expressive part of the works in Table 4.18 seeks only the obtainment of 

microstructure information of SOFC layers on the mesoscale level. This information is then 

usually used in either of two ways. In the first, it can provide lumped or homogenized 

microstructure parameters (e.g., porosity, tortuosity, constriction, and percolation factors) for 

the calculation of effective transport properties (e.g., effective diffusion coefficient), which then 

can be used in macroscale-continuum models (such as in §§4.5.2). In the second way, it 

provides detailed geometrical information of the physical domain (pore-phase or fluid domain; 

solid-phase or “walls”) over which gas transport equations can be directly solved. In order to 

solve these equations on the mesocale level, LBM is often applied, although other methods 

such as FVM and FEM have also been employed for this purpose (see §§4.6.2.6). It is 

important to emphasize that the mere fact of solving transport equations on the “geometrical 

mesoscale” does not mean that the problem's physics is evaluated in its entirety on the 

mesoscale level. This is because, besides the detailed geometric information, the form of 

governing and constitutive equations also dictates the description level of the problem. This 

point will be briefly seen in §§4.8. 

As mentioned earlier, partially resolved models use theoretically idealized material 

models that rely, to some extent, on empirical input data. Certainly, the goal of these simpler 

micro-geometry modeling methods is to use the minimum possible amount of experimental 

data as input, akin to methods that “reconstruct” 3D virtual samples of porous electrodes. The 

output of these partially resolved models finds its best application in macro-homogeneous 

models, as the former is able to provide the necessary lumped microstructure parameters used 

by the latter (see §§4.7). The more commonly used geometrical models have been developed 

to predict the influences of microstructural properties on certain “higher level properties”, which 

can then be applied in macroscale-continuum models. For example, they can predict the 

influence of solid grain size, pore size, and porosity on the TPB length (    ) of composite 

electrodes
[ 359, 360)

. Among partially resolved models there is the family of methods built upon 



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 176 
 

the statistical-based percolation theory
[ 361]

, which include models
[ 362, 363]

 that accounts for the 

presence of polydispersed powders and pore formers in composite electrodes, predicting 

effective properties such as the surface area and the mean hydraulic radius of pore phase. 

Some other percolation models
[ 364, 365]

, with considerable generality in their practical 

application, can also predict ionic and electronic effective conductivities. Table 4.19 provides a 

list of reference works that dealt with constitutive, partially resolved models of SOFC 

electrodes.

Notes: 

?: Based on percolation theory. 

 

Formally, neither the porosity nor tortuosity is evaluated as an output property using the 

models from Table 4.19. However, as a “backward problem”, the porosity, for instance, might 

be calculated using these models if an output property (e.g., TPB length) is given as known. 

 

 

 

 



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 177 
 

 

 

As highlighted in Chapter 1, the microstructure features of porous electrodes play a 

major influence on the performance of SOFCs and thus microstructural design constitutes a 

key part in the research and technology development of materials. Assuming that the basic 

engineering of new materials can be successfully accomplished by evaluating the effects of 

certain idealized microstructural parameters, modeling techniques that directly use these 

parameters (to predict cell performance) are therefore evidently relevant in streamlining the 

technology development process. General criteria to support the selection of different modeling 

techniques were discussed in §§1.4. Based on that discussion, structure or microstructure 

resolved models are computationally expensive techniques and hence their application is 

usually only feasible to small, representative volume elements (RVE) of the porous electrode 

(typically in the range of 1 x 10   m  to 5 x 10   m  for 3D samples
14

). In other words, 

numerical simulation is limited to (comparatively) quite small samples of the electrode material 

under study. On the other hand, macroscale-continuum models are far less computationally 

intensive and thus they allow easier larger-scale description of a complete single-cell body. 

However, in addition to the trade-offs related to time-consuming calculations, one must 

question how physical scale information can affect the accurate description of transport 

phenomena that is controlled by certain physical characteristic scales. For instance, to what 

extent the system of interest is, in fact, governed by macroscopic mass, momentum, and heat 

transfer; and to what extent “subgrid-scale” phenomena need to be properly resolved and 

hence cannot be undervalued. That is, to what degree one needs to include small scale 

information as a subset of the contents of larger scale physical-chemical processes, in order to 

represent important small scale physical-chemical processes that occur on spatio-temporal 

scales that cannot, otherwise, be adequately resolved on a macroscopic computational mesh. 

Structure-resolved models of porous components aim to increase the confidence level in 

explaining the macroscopic performance of SOFCs. These models, “by revealing what takes 

place in the underground”, are geared to give better “control” of material design parameters. 

Representative examples of such models, which directly incorporate microstructural 

information on the mesoscale, are presented in what follows (see full listing in Table 4.18). 

Nevertheless, “advanced topics” on porous media characterization (including measurement 

techniques, calculation methods, and analysis of microstructural properties) will not be 

appreciated in this work.  

                                                      
14

The determination of RVE is a critical step in microstructure resolved simulations of porous layers, especially 
when the sample volume size can affect numerical results. See Joss et al.

[ 345]
 and other references in Table 4.18. 

 



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 178 
 

Researchers from The University of Tokyo developed a series of studies
[ 335, 337, 91, 102, 

145]
 in which the FIB/SEM technique

15
 was combined with LBM to evaluate the performance of 

electrode microstructures. In these studies, it is noteworthy the development and discussion of 

new numerical methods to quantify the microstructure properties of 3D reconstructed 

computational domains, such as TPB length, volume fractions, connectivities, and tortuosities 

of the involved phases (e.g., pore, ionic, and electronic phases). In one of their papers
[ 337]

, 

random walk calculations were also used for comparison with LBM in evaluating tortuosity 

factors. The authors have not consistently applied the same mathematical models throughout 

their works and significant differences exist. Tables 4.20 and 4.21 include information for 

comparing them. 

For the sake of clarity, it should first be noted that the diffusion problem is actually 

solved by means of LBM; the continuum transport equations shown in the following tables (and 

also by the authors in their original papers) are mainly used as mathematical archetypes (i.e., 

“idealized statements”) for the phenomena they seek to represent. The reason for that is the 

general form of LBM equations, which encapsulates the physics of the problem under 

consideration and thus, in this case, “the conventional” transport equations of continuum 

physics convey (more clearly) the idea that “a diffusion model” is being addressed. 

Nonetheless, these “archetypes equations” play a key function in defining how the diffusion 

coefficient should be evaluated in the LBM model itself in order to calculate the necessary 

(single) relaxation time.

In Suzue et al.
[ 335]

 the authors applied a stochastic reconstruction technique in place of FIB/SEM. This 
reconstruction technique is based on the scheme originally proposed by Yeong and Torquato

[ 421],
 which 

statistically reconstructs 3D porous media from selected 2D cuts (SEM images) of the sample.

Assumptions and Remarks 

 i. In the derivation of Eq. (4.56d) it was assumed a binary gas composition of   /    and equimolar 
diffusion (thus constant total pressure, i.e.,  =   2    2 = c    ). Therefore, only the diffusion 

equation of hydrogen is solved, Eq. (4.56a). 
 

ii. Knudsen “diffusion” was accounted for using the Bosanquet formula, Eq. (4.56e) and (4.56f), wherein 

the Knudsen diffusion coefficient (Eq. 4.56g) is evaluated assuming a constant mean pore radius (0.75 

 m) in all simulated cases. 
 

iii. One can note the absence of porous medium structural parameters (e.g., porosity, tortuosity, and so 
on) in the modeling equations, especially in terms of effective transport coefficients, Eq. (4.56a)-
(4.56c). This is explained by the fact that these equations are being solved directly on the pore scale, 
thus the use of effective values is meaningless. The fields of state variables are resolved within the 
mesocale and their (averaged) values on the macroscale already incorporate effects due to the 
microstructure. 

 

iv. In Eq. (4.56m)    represents the velocity distribution function of “fictitious” particles of gas, electron, 

or ion with velocity
16

    in the  -th (link) direction;   
  

 is a Maxwellian local equilibrium distribution 

(local equilibrium value for the population of particles in the direction of the  -th link);    is the 
relaxation time;    represents the stencil point vector (“lattice points”) among voxels;    and    are 
the discretized time and space (voxel edge) steps, respectively. For 3D LBM simulations, D3Q15 (  = 
1,2,…,15) or D3Q19 (  = 1,2,…,19) models have been commonly used 

[ 369]
. In their work, however, 

Suzue et al.
[ 335]

 applied the D3Q6 (  = 1,2,…,6) model in the case of SOFCs, affirming that for simple 
diffusion simulations this model can be used with a slight loss of accuracy. 

 

v. Point-wise accurate LBM transport equations (4.56m) for charge and species conservation, Eq. (4.56a)-
(4.56c), are solved directly on the reconstructed porous layer (3D computational domain represented 
by cubic voxels). The second and third terms on the RHS of Eq. (4.56m) represent the rate of change in 
   due to binary molecular collisions and thus they approximate the collision operator of Boltzmann 
equation. 

 

vi. Oddly enough the authors used a constant relaxation time (  = 0.99), fixed for all simulations (see 
note “v” in Table 4.21).  No further information is given on how this particular time was obtained. 

Furthermore,   
  

 was also left unspecified (although it is said to be a “Maxwellia distribution”). These 

issues are of major importance because the collision operator is responsible for the evaluation of the 
diffusion phenomenon. Thus no clear link has been made with diffusion coefficients from transport 
equations, e.g. Eq. (4.56d), and, as a result of this, the modeling of diffusive processes “became a black 
box”. Thus, the notes “i’ and “ii” provided above are therefore without objective purpose, as one 
cannot really understand how the information on diffusion was actually handled. 

 

vii. The production term  ?   on the RHS of Eq. (4.56m) is calculated from the sources terms of Eq. (4.56a)-

(4.56c), using a scheme akin to that of Mukherjee and Wang
[ 370]

. A schematic exemplifying the 
reaction calculation procedure is shown in the figure above.  

 

 

                                                      
16

    in Eq. (4.56m) may also be interpreted as a discrete direction or plainly as a numerical quadrature point 

(representing a direction link) in the LBM. The term    is more generally represented using the notation e 
 , which 

is the velocity of the  -th chemical species along the  -th discrete direction. In Suzue et al.
[ 335]

 LBM equations 

were solved just for one species (  ) and the extra index is therefore unnecessary.

  viii. There is a notation error in Eq. (4.56l).  Partial pressures in this equation should have been divided by 
a reference pressure value. This is important not only for dimensional consistency, but also to discern 
between the pressure value actually adopted in simulations from that originally used as reference in 
the derivation of Eq. (4.56l). 

 

ix. As it appears, there is a critical error in Eq. (4.56h) when one inspects the definition given by Eq. 
(4.56k). As discussed in §§2.3, the polarization “ ” in this case must be the activation polarization 
(    ) and not its augmented version. Therefore, in this work the authors have completely neglected 
Nernstian voltage losses due to concentration polarizations. One might argue that in Eq. (4.56l) the 
influence of concentration would have been already accounted for. In this case, however, this latter 
equation was obtained from the work of de Boer

[ 94]
, which was, in fact, devised for use with activation 

polarization. Even though the form of the BVE Eq. (4.56h) is, in principle, meant to be applied with 
    , as this equation is an empirically-based formulation it is possible that one could use the 
exchange current density formula, Eq. (4.56l), to fit experimental results based on augmented 
polarization values. Nonetheless, besides being a conceptual incongruity, this procedure most 
certainly would lead to significant errors, even within the interpolation range of experimental data.

Assumptions and Remarks 

   i. Similarly to the work of [ 286], described in Table 4.3, Eq. (4.57a) may be seen as a result from DGM 
and which is valid for the case of isobaric counter-diffusion (uniform total pressure). Said more 
correctly, this equation follows directly from the Modified Maxwell-Stefan Model and not from DGM, 
assuming the validity of Graham’s “Law”. In this model, the Bosanquet formulation is also implied. The 
Knudsen diffusion coefficient was evaluated as in the previous work (Table 4.20) and also assuming a 
constant mean pore radius (0.75  m) in all simulated cases. 
 

ii. Differently from their previous work, Shikazono et al.
[ 91]

 solved transport equations for 
electrochemical potentials of electron and oxide ion (Eq. (4.57c) and (4.57d), respectively). Details on 
how electric potentials and polarizations values are recovered from electrochemical potentials can be 
found in the above mentioned paper.  

 

iii. Note that in Eq. (4.57e)-(4.57g) the sign of source terms has changed. There are two reasons for that: 
a. There was a change in the orientation of coordinate axes. In the previous work

[ 335]
, the 

positive direction of main reaction axis ( -axis) was oriented towards the electrolyte 
interface. However, in this work the positive direction of reaction axis (in this case the  -axis) 
is now oriented towards the current collector layer, so in the opposite direction. The sign 
change is necessary in order to maintain physical consistency of state variable gradients (i.e., 
the flux should be directed down the gradient field). 

 

b. Previously, equations governing the charge conservation were written in terms of electric 
potentials, whereas in this work the authors have opted to use electrochemical potentials. In 
this latter case, negative electric charges account for the change in sign (see Eq. (2.42)). 

 

iv. The BE, Eq. (4.57e), now uses the activation polarization (    ) according to the definition of Eq. 
(4.57h), instead of the augmented overvoltage. The error in their previous work was therefore 
corrected (see note “ix” in Table 4.20). The subscript “  ” used in Eq. (4.57h) stands for “reference 
electrode”, whose hypothetical surface is assumed to be in thermodynamic local equilibrium with the 
gaseous (gas bulk) phase. This definition of Eq. (4.57h) is formally equivalent to that of Eq. (2.29). 
 

v. In this work Shikazono et al.
[ 91]

 defined the relaxation time (  ) explicitly, according to Eq. (4.57k). 
Here the authors indicated that the time step    was chosen so that the relaxation time becomes 
  = 0.99. However, as the “DGM diffusion coefficient” (see Eq. (4.57l)) is not constant within the gas-
phase, the time step should be changed accordingly.

CONTINUATION OF TABLE 4.21 

   
vi. The work of Kanno et al.

[ 102]
 applied the same modeling equations of Shikazono et al.

[ 91]
, with some 

distinctions. They are: 
a. The authors have incorporated another model for evaluating the exchange current density  0: 

in addition to de Boer’s model
[ 94]

, as per Eq. (4.57i), they have also considered an exponential 
equation fitted on experimental data from Bieberle et al.

[ 371]
 for comparison purposes.  

 

b. Although the relaxation time (  ) was calculated using the same equations, Eq. (4.57k) and 
(4.57l), there is a slight difference concerning the time step   . Kanno et al.

[ 102]
 chose     so 

that the relaxation time results   = 0.99 at the point where the diffusion coefficient   takes 
its maximum value. 

 

vii. Matsuzaki et al.
[ 145]

 applied very similar models to those of Shikazono et al.
[ 91]

 and Kanno et al.
[ 102]

. In 
the case of Matsuzaki and coauthors the used equations have a number of obvious differences 
stemming from the fact that a different type of problem was considered in their work (i.e., the 
modeling of a MIEC cathode instead of   -    composite anodes). A specific modification worth 
mentioning concerns the expression used to evaluate the relaxation time in the LBM:   = 0.5  
   [3     ]? . Thus one sees that the factor “3” is now in the denominator when compared to Eq. 
(4.57k). It is not clear, however, whether this was a typographical error or not, as there was no written 
argument for such modification. 

 

Researchers from The University of Connecticut have developed LBM simulations
[ 372, 

373, 338, 374]
 to study 2D and 3D mass diffusion of both reacting and inert species in the pore 

space of   -    anodes. For 3D simulations, the authors used computational domains 

constructed from both real (reconstructed via XCT) and virtual samples of porous elect rodes, 

the latter based on 3D material models constructed via sphere packing algorithm. For 2D 

simulations, geometry input data from a single micrograph (SEM) image was used in 

conjunction with periodic boundary conditions along one of the two main coordinates axes (in 

order to represent the total extents of the original electrode layer; see Figure 4.7 for 

clarifications). The main goal in these works
[ 372, 338]

 has been to develop a multicomponent 

mass transport model to obtain the steady-state mole fraction distributions of reacting (  , 

   ) and inert (  ) gases throughout the porous anode (see Fig. 4.7). This information was 

used to evaluate the effect of medium geometry (mainly the porosity) and to calculate the 

anodic concentration polarization. A secondary goal was to determine structural (porosity-

tortuosity) factors      of reconstructed 3D geometries, by solving the 3D Laplace equation for 

a “generic conserved quantity” (see [ 338] for details). Calculated factors were then used in 1D 

macro-homogeneous models employing effective diffusivity values (as in, for example, the 

model given in Table 4.4), to simulate the same multicomponent mass transport problem. 

Finally, respective results were compared to those from the structure-resolved (LBM) 

simulation. 



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 184 
 

In terms of physical modeling considerations, the markedly differences of the works of 

Joshi and coworkers in comparison to that of tables 4.20 and 4.21 are: (i) Joshi and coworkers 

considered a true multicomponent mass transport (i.e., ternary gas system), whereas 

researchers from the University of Tokyo solved the mass diffusion problem for only one gas 

component (i.e.,   ); (ii) differently from the models in tables 4.20 and 4.21, Joshi and 

coworkers treated the TPB region as an infinitely thin boundary (located at anode/electrolyte 

interface) and thus without the precise spatial identification of TPB regions through the anode 

thickness; (iii) as a direct result of (ii), Joshi and coworkers have also not considered the 

simultaneous modeling of electron transport (through the    phase) and ion transport (through 

the     phase). Nonetheless, the multicomponent mass transport model developed by Joshi 

et al.
[ 373]

 has a higher physical fidelity and relies on less simplifying assumptions. Their LBM 

variant is based on the two-fluid model initially proposed by Luo and Girimaji
[ 375]

 and extended 

by McCracken and Abraham
[ 376]

 in order to model gas components with different molecular 

weights. Even though Joshi and coworkers have discussed elsewhere (e.g., see [ 377]) about 

the capability of LBM in describing non-continuum diffusion effects, this topic was not the focus 

of their SOFC simulations
[ 372, 373, 338]

, wherein they focused on continuum transport modeling 

only. The actual mathematical model proposed by these authors will not be presented in this 

section, as this would require an overly lengthy discussion of LBM, unfit for the purposes of 

this chapter.

Paradis and Sundén
[ 346]

 evaluated the application of LBM for modeling reaction-

diffusion processes in a porous SOFC anode on a mesoscopic level. These authors applied 

the modeling framework of Joshi and coworkers
[ 372, 373]

, with the apparent difference being that 

Paradis and Sundén considered a binary gas mixture (   and    ). They also performed LBM 

simulations in 2D porous domains: one of the porous domains was created through randomly 

placed circular obstacles; and the other one was obtained by discretization of a single 

micrograph image of a real anode sample. By studying different simulations scenarios, with 

and without including the production and consumption of chemical species (i.e., 

electrochemical reactions), Paradis and Sundén aimed at the evaluation of geometry effects as 

a “potential risk” for limiting transport processes (“transport blockage”). Although there are not 

much supporting results or discussion in their paper, these authors were probably intereste d in 

highlighting that currently used macro-homogeneous models might not be capable of 

evaluating microstructure effects of porous SOFC anodes. In other words, that with a few 

empirical macroscopic parameters (e.g., porosity and tortuosity) one cannot properly describe 

the effective interaction between fluid particles and walls of the porous media, and thus to 

capture the mesoscopic physical behavior. 

 

Guan et al.
[ 351]

 applied the modeling framework of Joshi and coworkers to simulate gas 

transport in   -    3D microstructures subjected to thermal cycling treatments. Thermal 

cycling treatments strongly influence the anode 3D structure, including interior connectivity, 

phase size, and TPB density. After each thermal cycle, the authors calculated the 

concentration polarization based on the simulation results of mole fraction distributions of 

electroactive species, through the connected pore phase. Even though Guan et al. have 

obtained a (experimental) 3D detailed distribution of TPB sites (from XCT reconstructed 

microstructures samples), they chose a simplified distribution model of TPBs, akin to the work 

of Joshi et al.
[ 372]

, where TPB regions were treated as zero-thickness boundary, located at the 

anode/electrolyte interface. It is worth noting an erroneous statement made in the paper of 

Guan et al.
[ 351]

: the authors stated that the LBM is improper for gas transport modeling when 

the pore diameter is smaller than the mean free path of the gas molecules (e.g., when 

“diffusion” is dominated by molecule–wall interactions); and that, in this case, LBM should be 

replaced by other methods. The literature is vast enough (though largely ignored by the SOFC 

community) with respect to works that use LBM in nanoporous materials or in other flow 

systems with rarified effects. Surely, the LBM version that was applied by Guan et al. is 



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 186 
 

unsuited for this task, but this does not mean LBM is definitely unable to model the 

intermediate regime, encompassing free molecular flows.  Certainly, strong non-equilibrium 

flows cannot be properly described by theories based on standard Bolztmann equation
[ 174, 378]

 

and , therefore, through hierarchically derived models such as the LBM. 

 

Xu et al.
[ 329, 379]

 performed LBM simulations on the mesosscale to emphasize the 

capabilities of this modeling technique for the accurate prediction of multi-component mass 

transfer in SOFC porous electrodes, especially when it is compared to traditional approaches 

such as macro-continuum models. Furthermore, despite the frequently assumption made in 

some SOFC modeling approaches, which ignores the concentration polarization (i.e., assumes 

that the gas transport in SOFC electrodes is a “very efficient process”), these authors discuss 

that multi-component mass transfer in porous electrodes can have profound effect on the 

simulation of the cell electrochemical performance. More precisely, Xu and coauthors indicate 

that concentration polarization can reach the same order of magnitude as the other two main 

polarizations (“activation” and “ohmic”) for the cases of low porosity, low reactant 

concentrations, and high average current densities. Therefore, they conclude that to simply 

neglect the concentration loss is unreasonable based on the account that reactant 

concentration and current density vary sharply along the flow channel of fuel cell
[ 329]

. 

Meanwhile, these authors also affirm that some classical macroscopic models (e.g., based on 

MFM, DGM, and MSM), which have been used to evaluate concentration polarization, might 

as well result in imprecise prediction of SOFC losses, given that they are not competent to 

study the gas transport accurately in porous electrodes on the micro or mesoscale. Or, at 

least, Xu and coauthors have shown that LBM can be a much more accurate method for 

simulating mass transfer within SOFC electrodes.  

Xu and coauthors used a representative elementary volume (REV) scale Lattice-

Boltzmann (LB) model based on the Brinkman-like equation for flows in porous media.  

Compared to other the pore scale models (including most of LBM models mentioned in the 

above paragraphs), in which detailed geometric information is needed and the computation 

domain cannot be too large due to limited computational resources, the REV scale LB model 

can be used for systems of larger size and it is more competitive in parametric studies. Several 

LBM models in SOFC literature has either adopted single-fluid models (employing single 

relaxation time approximation, which is restricted to unity Prandtl and Schmidt numbers
[ 369]

 or 

has taken the species concentration field as mere a passive scalar. Similarly to Joshi et al.
[ 373]

, 

Xu and coauthors implemented
[ 329]

 a two-fluid model, which treats mutual collisions and self-



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 187 
 

collisions independently so that the viscosity and diffusion coefficients can be varied 

independently by a proper choice of mutual- and self-collision relaxation-time scales. The 

authors have applied the REV scale LB model in 2D simulations to investigate the transport of 

multi-component reactant gases and to study electrochemical characteristics of a planar 

anode-supported SOFC
[ 379]

. As for the case of Joshi et al.
[ 372, 373]

, the actual mathematical 

model proposed by Xu and coauthors will not be presented in this section, as this would also 

require an overly lengthy discussion of LBM. 

 

Finally, there are works in the SOFC literature that solved continuum transport 

equations (the same as those presented in §§4.5.2) on the pore-scale, using well-known 

methods such as finite-difference method
[ 341, 354]

, finite-volume method
[ 356]

, finite-element 

method
[ 344]

, and volume of fluid method
[ 333]

. Essentially, the goal of these works has been to 

predict physical properties by solving discretized partial differential equations without source 

terms (e.g., Laplace equation). Since boundary conditions are identical for the equivalent 

macro-homogeneous material and the real sample material, the pore scale solution (e.g., local 

concentration distribution or its resulting mass flux evaluated at the boundaries of the domain) 

is then compared to prescribed macroscale mass fluxes in order to calculate effective transport 

properties (e.g., effective diffusion coefficient). For instance

    =
  ,   

      ?    
? (?

    (4.58) 

 

where in Eq. (4.58):   represents some conserved quantity (e.g., species concentration);     

corresponds to either  ,   or   (along the sample volume axes);   = 0 for  =    and   =

   =  ?    ??, where  ? is the outward pointing unit normal field of the sample’s boundary) ; 

       is the (local) bulk diffusion coefficient (depending on the phenomenon, it can be either 

heat conductivity, electronic or ionic conductivity, or mass diffusivity), characteristic of the 

phase present in the considered voxel. Here again the reconstructed material enters the 

simulation after its voxelization and it is thus described as a set of rectangular or cubic of 

voxels. The numerics are performed on equidistant variables at the voxel centers. Within each 

voxel,        is assumed constant. The quantity  =    ,  ,    is the solution obtained from the 

discretized partial differential equations that were solved within the reconstructed (voxelized) 

sample material, in a preceding step. 



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 188 
 

 

In a brief, macroscale models informed by microscale
17

 correlations are simply those 

models already discussed in §§4.5.2, but which employ partially-resolved models of porous 

electrodes (see §§4.6.1) to evaluate the required effective transport properties. These models 

are more commonly applied in parametric studies, when one is particularly interested in 

assessing, on a straightforward manner, the effects of certain micro-geometry parameters 

(e.g., electrode particle size) on macroscale variables (e.g., current density and cell voltage). 

This type of modeling technique may be included within the so-called “hierarchical multiscale 

approaches”, in which known information at one scale, typically passing through some sort of 

averaging process, is used to generate a model on a larger scale. A listing of reference works 

that have applied the above mentioned technique is provided in Table 4.22 (some these 

references were already cited in other sections of this chapter).

It may seem contradictory, but several of the works reviewed in §§4.6 (“single-scale 

models on the mesoscale”) are also, in some sense, what one may refer to as “macroscale 

models Informed by microscale simulations”. That is, although they solve transport equations 

on a characteristic mesocale length (“geometrical mesoscale”), part of the physics that are 

captured by the modeling equations are not on the mesocale but on a coarser-scale. 

Therefore, the claims of some of those works of having performed “fully mesoscale 

simulations” are not, rigorously, a true assertion. From the perspective that transport

 Here the term “microscale” is used loosely, meaning everything that is “smaller” than the macroscale. 



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 189 
 

phenomena have been solved in the pore-level description (mesoscale length) those works 

have indeed simulated, at least partially, mesoscale phenomena. However, as most of the 

governing (and/or constitutive equations) have been expressed under the hypothesis of a 

continuum medium (e.g., for which the validity of the hydrodynamic limit is implied), they also 

incorporate some of the limits that constrain the macroscale-continuum description. 

Furthermore, the use of LBMs based on a single relaxation time is another example of such 

limitation
[ 386, 387, 388]

. 

Therefore, at this point one may acknowledge that all representative works from the 

SOFC literature that applied “macroscale models Informed by microscale simulations” have 

been considered in preceding sections. There is but one example that is worth (re)mentioning 

and that should be taken as representative of the class of simulations that indirectly, or non-

concurrently (see §§4.9 for clarification on this term), use microscale information to simulate 

macroscale processes. These models (“macroscale models informed by microscale 

simulations based on 3D reconstructions”) are conceived in a similar fashion to those 

described in §§4.7 (“hierarchical multiscale approach”), but with the fundamental difference 

related to how microstructural parameters (“the passing information”) are quantitatively 

evaluated. In this case, these parameters (whether purely morphological or not) are obtained 

through direct numerical simulation on the geometrically complex pore-scale, which was 

topographically reconstructed from FIB-SEM or XCT measurements. The information gathered 

from the pore-scale simulation is then averaged to the appropriate macroscale characteristic 

length, using some suitable homogenization method (as, for example, the one mentioned at 

the end of §§4.6.2). Once microstructural parameters have been quantified, they are used in 

1D (or, sometimes, in 2D) macroscale simulation of SOFC electrodes. 

A representative example of such modeling technique, which indirectly use microscale 

information to simulate macroscale processes, is that of Kishimoto et al.
[ 342]

 who have 

quantified microstructural parameters (e.g., volume fractions, tortuosity factor, surface-to-

volume ratio, and TPB density) by means of random-walk-based diffusion simulations. The 

quantified parameters were then applied in the 1D macro-homogeneous numerical simulation 

of a   –    cermet, using the DGM to evaluate the mass transport. Other examples from 

literature that applied this modeling technique were already presented in this chapter
[ 373, 328]

. 

These works all have implemented 1D macro-homogeneous models as a basis of comparison 

with 3D mesoscopic models of electrode performance. However, in their assessment of one -

dimensional models, the respective discussions were relatively narrow in scope. In the 

aforementioned works, microstructural parameters have been obtained as fixed values, without 

the possibility to link these values to the changes of microstructure features ( e.g., in contrast to 



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 190 
 

the micro-modeling models of Table 4.19) unless a new full simulation on the pore-scale is 

performed. This possibility would confer a significant flexibility to their usage and also enrich 

the discussion on how these models compare to 3D mesoscopic models. By the time of this 

writing, there is no published work in SOFC literature that derives expressions to upscale 

individual pore performance to full-scale electrodes
18

. Furthermore, most published works 

have only resorted to “full homogenization” (i.e., a single parameter value is attributed to 

porous layer as a whole
19

) and none of them has applied more sophisticated (i.e., more 

rigorous) upscaling techniques, such as those based on the method of volume averaging
[ 389, 

390, 48, 391]
. 

 

 

This section address some topics that are deemed important to clarify key concepts of 

mulsticale modeling, particularly within the context of the so-called “macroscale models 

Informed by microscale simulations”. The present dissertation work is not, in fact, about 

multiscale modeling techniques per se or bridging-scale methods
[ 154, 155, 39]

.  However, by 

briefly examining some of the principles and methods of multiscale modeling, this monograph 

can certainly emphasize the potential deficiencies of current SOFC mathematical models used 

to simulate mass transport processes. Several of these deficiencies are related to whether or 

not perform microscale or mesoscale simulations according to local (microscopic and 

mesoscopic) quantities instead of using macroscale-continuum constitutive relations. That is, 

in what conditions one should calculate macroscopic properties of materials by theoretical 

modeling and computational simulation from a more fundamental perspective. This 

“inescapable” necessity of modeling physicochemical processes on disparate scales, in order 

to accurately evaluate large-scale phenomena, has been suggestively referred to as “the 

tyranny of scales”
[ 392]

 because it is not an easy task to recognize the aforementioned 

conditions. Moreover, no single solution or approach has the potential of bridging all dissimilar 

scales
[ 154, 155]

 in to a seamless description. 

 

                                                      
18

 The work of Bertei et al.
[ 334]

 would be the closest to this goal. As an example of what is meant by “expressions 
to upscale pore-scale performance,” see Blasi et al.

[ 420]
 who have modeled reaction–diffusion processes within 

catalyst washcoats. 
 

19
 Nishi et al.

[ 328]
 seems to be an exception. These authors also applied a 1D model with local values for the 

tortuosity factor (i.e., the value of this parameter varied according to the distance from the electrolyte interface). 
The model gave poor results when compared to the one that used averaged tortuosities ( i.e., a single parameter 
value). 
 



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 191 
 

Multiscale modeling is a wide-ranging interdisciplinary field, where approaches are 

often material- and application-specific. The use of any multiscale approach has to be carefully 

weighed on a case-by-case basis
[ 155]

. According to Fish
[ 154]

, multiscale modeling should take 

advantage of the fact that in many natural systems only a small fraction of the total region is of 

interest. Determining which regions should be simulated with coarse-scale
20

 or fine-scale 

models really improves the odds of minimizing the above mentioned deficiencies. Outside of 

the region of interest one should only perform coarse-scale calculations, because no detailed 

information about this region is necessary. Whereas in the region of interest one should 

perform both fine-scale and coarse-scale calculations: the coarse-scale describes the 

homogeneous part of physicochemical processes using just a few degrees of freedom; on the 

other hand, the solution of fine-scale equations enables the detailed modeling of 

physicochemical processes and thus higher fidelity where it is necessary. Therefore, by 

considering simultaneously models on different scales, the aim is to select a multiscale 

approach that effectively shares the efficiency of macroscopic models as well as the accuracy 

of microscopic models
[ 39]

. Multiscale approaches may be subdivided in two categories
[ 155]

: 

I. Information-passing (or hierarchical) multiscale approach: in this approach, the 

fine-scale response is idealized (i.e., approximated or unresolved) and its overall 

(average) response is incorporated into the coarse-scale description. Information-

passing methods are typically used to model the overall response of fine-scale 

phenomena, except at the so-called “hot spots”, e.g. in the vicinity of boundary- 

layers, where concurrent methods are more suitable. The quantities of interest are 

limited to the coarse-scale, provided that they can be readily computable from 

fine-scale information. Special features of the fine-scale physics (e.g., scale 

separation and self-similarity) should be taken advantage of. 
 

II. Concurrent multiscale approach: fine and coarse-scale resolutions are 

simultaneously employed at different portions of the problem domain (in some 

modeling contexts, this approach is also known as “hybrid method”) and the 

exchange of information occurs through their interface. Thus, the concurrent 

multiscale modeling performs simultaneous simulations at different spatio-

temporal scales within a single simulation process, in which there is dynamic 

sharing of information between concurrent simulations. Computational 

subdomains, where different scale resolutions are employed, can be either 

disjoint or overlapping. 
 

Concurrent approaches require that precise information on the material microstructure 

should be known in subdomains where fine-scale models are to be considered. Moreover, the 

interface (or interphase) between the fine and coarse scales should be properly described. 

Thus, the utilization of concurrent methods is, in practice, hindered when there is a lack of 

                                                      
20

 From the point of view of statistical mechanics, coarse-scales are those that can be observed directly in 
experiments and only the averaged effects (ensemble averaging) of fine-scales quantities are important. 



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 192 
 

detailed knowledge about the microstructure at “hot spots”. At these locations, concurrent 

multiscale approaches require fine-scale resolution whereas information-passing approaches 

only require the material microstructure to be reconstructed in small representative “windows” 

(i.e., from a REV sample). Another formidable roadblock to concurrent approaches is the 

uncertainty and complexity introduced by the physics of finer-scales, which requires the (prior) 

identification of what information need to be transferred from one model or scale to another 

and what physicochemical principles must be satisfied during the transfer of information
[ 154]

. 

Thus, when coupling coarse and fine scales one has to account for the different fundamentals 

of each theory (e.g., whereas in the theory of molecular dynamics every individual molecule is 

considered, in the continuum mechanics an average is considered) and how to properly 

describe the transition (or the so-called “handshaking”) region that actually bridges both 

theories. 

In both information-passing and concurrent approaches, the overall response of the 

material from its fine-scale constituents can be obtained using homogenization techniques
[ 155, 

389, 391]
.  Among the necessary conditions for homogenization of a multiscale system, one 

requires that, at a certain finer scale, the governing equations, including the constitutive 

equations of physical phases, are well understood or, at least, better understood than at the 

coarser-scale
[ 154]

. Under this assumption, homogenization establishes a mathematical 

framework by which coarse-scale equations can be derived from well-defined fine-scale 

equations, provided that spatial scales are separable at all relevant scales. However, the 

variability of physicochemical parameters at multiple scales might affect the medium 

homogenization and thus the simulation outcome. For instance, microcracks are often 

randomly distributed and characterization of their interface properties is difficult. In this case, 

the use of a multiscale approach may not be the best choice. Nevertheless, novel multiscale 

techniques, such as the multi-resolution continuum approach
[ 393]

 can cope with the above 

difficulty by incorporating statistical factors into the mathematical model. The multi -resolution 

continuum approach is based on the concurrent nested homogenization of the randomness of 

material structures. 

Information-passing and concurrent multiscale approaches are two alternative (and 

complementary) modeling techniques that constitute what was referred to as “macroscale 

models Informed by microscale simulations”. The SOFC literature that has been reviewed in 

this dissertation has no examples in which the concurrent multiscale approach was effectively 

applied. Furthermore, a number of works that have allegedly performed fine-scale simulations 

(as in §§4.6) are affected by possible inconsistencies between the length scale on which 

simulations have been executed and the theoretical basis that limits the physical validity of the 



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 193 
 

respective modeling equations. These inconsistencies may be seen as a manifestation of the 

limits for the spatial and temporal scales within which the “true” governing physics is valid. The 

physics governing transport processes often changes with scale, so that the models 

themselves must change in structure as the numerous ramifications of transport-related events 

pass from one scale to another. Therefore, the correct description for the applicable scaling 

physics can dominate simulation efforts wherever large disparities in spatio-temporal scales 

are encountered
[ 392]

As the main topic of this work is the discussion of gas transport within the porous layer 

of SOFCs, only succinct remarks are made in order to highlight a number of possible 

shortcomings of simplified mathematical models that are used in gas channels. Moreover, as 

introduced in §§1.4, only the button-cell flow arrangement is considered herein. Nevertheless, 

much of the discussion in this section is general enough to be valid for other types of channel 

geometries. The importance of properly modeling gas channels has been already discussed in 

this chapter: the main goal of this model is, within the overall simulation setup, to account for 

the effect of fuel (or oxidant) depletion along the gas channel of a SOFC (see Fig. 3.8 and Fig. 

3.9), as progressively more fuel/oxidant is utilized in the chemical reactions. Ideally, this model 

should capture all non-uniformities (gradients) in the concentration of gas species within the 

channel’s volume. Thus, not just the lengthwise depletion is important but also the 

determination of the actual gas concentration at the channel/porous layer interface; that is, in 

the case where the gas concentration value in the “bulk” (far away from the wall) is significantly 

different from that found deep within the flow boundary-layer. 

From the point of view of fluid dynamics, gas flows in button-cells (see Fig. 1.17 and 

Fig. 1.18) can be considered to fall within the general family of impinging wall jet flows; or, 

more precisely, radial wall jets
[ 394, 395]

 formed by the normal impingement of a round (or slot) 

jet, whose nozzle is separated from the wall by a finite distance (often called nozzle-plate 

spacing or just gap). The radial jet is assumed to spread over a plain, permeable wall with local 

suction and/or injection (depending on the “flux direction” of the net reaction rate in the porous 

domain). Although this type of flow has been extensively studied in the literature
[ 396, 397, 398, 399, 

400, 401, 402, 403]
, works in the SOFC literature paid little or no attention to these studies. 

Therefore, no comprehensive review will be reported in this monograph concerning this 



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 194 
 

thematic (“impinging wall jets”). The presentation will be limited to what is typically consi dered 

in the SOFC literature. 

There are three alternative formulations often used for simulating the steady-state flow 

in gas channels for conditions that are typical of button-type SOFCs, namely: (i) Navier-Stokes 

equations (or CFD approach); (ii) boundary-layer equations; and (iii) plug-flow equations. 

Nevertheless, models based on the boundary-layer approximation have seldom been used 

(this author is unaware of any published work that actually applied such models to SOFCs). 

The discussion of these models will be in the lines of Raja et al.
[ 404]

, who critically evaluated 

similar flow models for catalytic-combustion monoliths. The remarks on gas channel models 

aim to draw attention to the range of validity of the various approximations in terms of physical 

and numerical accuracy (computational resources required to perform calculations is of less  

importance here). 

Depending on the flow conditions, certain approximations and simplifications may be 

appropriate in representing the mass transport. Comprehensive models are often based on 

solving the complete Navier-Stokes equations (i.e., CFD numerical codes), considering mass 

and momentum transport along both radial and axial directions. Plug-flow models are relatively 

simpler models that disregard diffusive terms, forming a differential-algebraic-equation (DAE) 

initial-value problem for the axial variation of the “mean” species composition. An intermediate 

alternative is to use models based on the boundary-layer approximation, wherein axial 

(stream-wise) diffusive transport is neglected, but detailed transport to and from channel walls 

is retained (including diffusion). In this case, boundary-layer equations can be casted into a 

system of DAEs (for instance, using the method of lines).  

Beyond assuming perfect-gas behavior and laminar regime, Navier-Stokes equations 

(the CFD approach) used in the SOFC literature have few assumptions. Their solution, when 

solved in conjunction with mass-species transport equations (e.g., Fickian models), provides 

axisymmetric velocity, pressure, and species composition fields in the channel (see Fig. 4.8 as 

an example of CFD solution in a button-cell). There are several numerical studies that have 

used CFD models to calculate the flow in the gas channels of button-type SOFCs
[ 31, 405, 304, 406, 

407, 408, 409]
. Particularly, in Fig. 4.9 it is shown the CFD solution obtained by Goldin et al.

[ 304]
 for 

the    mole fraction along the button-cell symmetry axis (fuel chamber). In this case, one can 

verify that the concentration gradient, along the normal direction to the wall, was in fact 

negligible at different testing conditions of current density and fuel flow rate.  However, as will 

be seen below, this may not be always the case (e.g., mass-transfer limited reactions) 

depending on channel geometry and cell operating conditions (e.g., reaction rates, flow rates, 

fuel/oxidant dilution ratio).

Comparative results
[ 404]

 indicate that the boundary-layer and Navier-Stokes models are 

in good agreement over a wide range of flow conditions. The plug flow model, however, must 

be used with caution. Under some flow conditions, when chemical reactions are mass-transfer 

limited, plug-flow models can significantly overpredict the conversion rates of fuel and/or 

oxidant. Thus, in some situations, the range of applicability of these models is critically limited 

if accuracy is sought to be achieved. Still according to Raja et al.
[ 404]

 the validity of the 

boundary-layer approximations improve as the Reynolds number increases. Under these 

circumstances, the axial diffusive transport is diminished in comparison to the radial diffusion 

and convective transport. On the other hand, as Reynolds number decreases, the stream-wise 

diffusion strengthens relative to convection. Mathematically, the character of the governing 

equations would change from parabolic to elliptic and, in this case, the accuracy of the 

boundary-layer approximation can be expected to decrease. Latter in this section, two 

boundary-layer models will be shortly addressed, namely the radial flow reactor (RFR) and 

stagnation flow reactor (SFR). 

 

Plug-flow equations (plug flow reactor model or just PFR) eliminate all diffusive terms 

and therefore any boundary-layer physics. In the axial direction, diffusion is assumed to be 

small compared to axial convective transport (much the same assumption as in the boun dary-

layer approximation). In the radial direction, however, diffusive transport (“crosswise mixing”) is 

assumed to be over dominant, thereby resulting in no radial variations in species composition. 

The plug-flow equation of continuity for the  -th species may be written as: 

 (     )

  
=

  
  

     ? ,  =
  
  

   ( ? ,  
     ? ,  

    
  
  

  ? ,  
    ) (4.59) 

 

This equation is analogous to Eq. (4.45a), with the following nuances: the molar basis 

(m   m?   ? ) source term    ?,   is now expressed by the sum of three source terms.  The term 

  ?,  
    represents the net mass addition (or depletion) to (or from) the gas flow at wall surfaces

21
. 

In the case that the walls of the channel are purely catalytic substrates (i.e., impermeable and 

without mass deposition or etching reactions), there is no net mass exchange and thus this 

term vanishes identically (obviously, this is not the situation of SOFC gas channels). The terms 

  ?,  
    and   ?,  

     represent the production (or depletion) of the  -th gas-phase species by surface 

                                                      
21

 The net mass exchange can arise as a result of non-catalytic surface reactions (mass deposition or etching) 
and from flow through permeable walls (i.e., suction or injection).  



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 197 
 

and gas-phase reactions in the channel, respectively.   ?,  
     only accounts for the production 

(or consumption) due to homogeneous reactions within the bulk volume of gas-phase. For 

SOFCs, the usual case is to have   ?,  
   =   ?,  

    = 0. In order to evaluate   ?,  
    and   ?,  

   , surface 

convection-diffusion equations can be solved on active wall surfaces with suitable coupling to 

the bulk species concentrations. One sees, therefore, that    ?,   is an “apparent bulk source 

term”: both convective and diffusive mass fluxes at the wall are converted to this apparent 

source term.  

One should note that if the net mass flow in the gas channel is held constant (e.g., 

 ? =      = c    .), then as the species composition changes the density and velocity will 

vary accordingly. If  ? is not constant, besides a constitutive equation of state, an extra axial 

momentum equation would be required in order to solve the problem (see APPENDIX A), 

rigorously speaking. In this case an additional source term, related to the net mass addition in 

the channel, must be added to the axial momentum equation as well. This additional 

“momentum source term” will be properly represented as a spurious mass source term in the 

equation continuity for the mean flow. Finally, it is also important to highlight that in the plug-

flow model both    and   are mean values with no radial variations. That is, the PFR yields 

solutions that should be considered as spatially averaged in the radial direction. Thus, in order 

to compare plug-flow solutions with results of Navier-Stokes or boundary-layer model it is 

necessary to calculate radially averaged species compositions. For instance, at a given axial 

location the mass-weighted, radially averaged mass fraction can be calculated as
[ 404]

: 

 ? =
?           
 0
0

?         
 0
0

 (4.60) 

 

According to Raja et al.
 [ 404]

 the plug flow model tends to overpredict reactions rates (at 

least in the case originally studied by these authors, where only wall catalytic reactions were 

considered). The reason for that is the inherent, radially homogeneous “nature” (i.e., 

simplifying assumption) of the plug flow model, which imposes an ideally intimate interaction 

between gas and surface. In a realistic depiction, however, the mass boundary-layer hinders 

the mass transfer between gas and reactor’s wall. Mass transfer coefficients can be used 

within the PFR framework to represent this “resistance” to mass transfer between the active 

surface and the mean gas composition, improving the accuracy of the plug-flow model, Eq. 

(4.59). In other words, mass transfer coefficients can be used to approximate the resistance to 

species mass transport crosswise. Such technique is only useful when these coefficients can 

be determined quantitatively or reliably estimated for a range of flow conditions. Nevertheless, 

for problems involving complex chemistry at surfaces and relatively short channels, mass 



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 198 
 

transfer coefficients are not easily correlated
[ 33, 404]

. For instance, Eq. (4.59)  may be modified 

as
[ 404]

: 

 (     )

  
=

  
  

   ( ? ,  , 
     

  
  

  ? ,  
    ) (4.61) 

 

 ? ,  , 
    =   ? ,  , 

     ? ,  , 
    =

     , 
  

(  ,    , ?    ) (4.62) 

 

where   ?,  , 
     is the “corrected” mass source term which accounts for the effects of mass 

transfer resistance;      ,  is the mass transfer coefficient of the  -th species;   ,  is the 

mixture mass density of the gas, which is evaluated at the channel surface;     is the radially 

averaged mean mass density of the  -th species: 

   =  ?   ?   (4.63) 

 

where the radially averaged density   ? is calculated as 

  ? =
?       
 0
0

?     
 0
0

 ( 0 is the channel radius) (4.64) 

 

The surface reaction rates   ?,  , 
    and   ?,  , 

    are now calculated using the gas-phase mass 

fractions evaluated at the surface (  , ). The species mass fractions are determined from Eq. 

(4.62), which is, in the general case, an implicit nonlinear algebraic relationship between 

heterogeneous reactions rates and the gas-phase composition at the surface.  It must be 

solved simultaneously with the mass-continuity equation, Eq. (4.61). Generally, mass transfer 

coefficients will be different for each species and will vary with respect to the axial position 

along the channel length, i.e.,      , =      ,    . They can be determined from the “full 

solution” of the channel flow field (e.g., obtained via CFD) or fitted from experimental data, as:

scale for the mass transport process. It is expected that Sherwood numbers attain high values

value
[ 404]

.  

The high initial value of    ,  is associated with the very thin mass boundary-layer that 

begin to develop at the active leading edge
22

. For simple boundary conditions, the Sherwood 

number should decrease monotonically to an asymptotic value far downstream. For relatively 

more complex surface chemistry, however, it is unlikely that      ,  possess a simple 

monotonic behavior. Furthermore, for high Reynolds numbers the chemistry behavior will tend 

to persist farther into the channel, as a result of which the Sherwood number may not 

approach its asymptotic value by the channel exit (i.e., within the fixed channel length). A 

generalized correlation between the Sherwood number and nondimenional groups that 

characterizes the flow (e.g., the reciprocal of the Graetz number) can be devised as

where  ,  , and   are empirical parameters  and the species Schmidt number may be

  (4.68) 

 

Such correlation can be derived for laminar flows with constant gas-phase composition at the 

surface or for constant surface reaction rates
[ 162, 33]

. However, for problems involving complex 

chemistry and concurrent transport phenomena is most probable that no general Sherwood 

number correlation can be found. 

In the particular case studied by Raja et al., these authors suggested the adoption of 

practical bounds to evaluate the range within which the plug-flow assumptions should be valid:

Where   is a characteristic length scale of the flow problem. Some analysis is required 

concerning the precise definition of this length scale. If this length scale comprehends the 

entire channel length, then a complete “chemical reaction plus transport” event appears to 

occur within a very small distance from the leading edge of the channel. In this situation, 

concentration profiles will be nearly vertical (see, for example, Fig. 4.9), which is really what 

the plug-flow assumption is about (i.e., good results on the scale of the channel length). on the 

other hand, if the region of interest lies in the vicinity of leading edge, then the axial length

 The hydrodynamic boundary-layer begins to develop immediately as the unreacted flow enters the channel. A 
mass boundary-layer starts to grow as soon as mass transfer rates are meaningfully different from zero. 



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 200 
 

scale of interest will be much smaller than the channel length. In this case, the plug-flow model 

is expected to be rather inaccurate at this reduced length scale. 

In the SOFC literature, virtually all published works that have applied the PFR to model 

the gas channel have disregarded the effect of mass transfer resistance and many of the 

remarks that have been made above. Examples to the contrary are really scarce. An exception 

worth noting is the work of Nagel et al.
[ 410]

. These authors noted that depending on the 

geometry of the gas channel, the diffusion of the reacting species from the bulk gas to the 

catalyst surface can be slower than the actual chemical reaction. In this situation, the partial 

pressures of the reactants at the catalyst surface can differ significantly from that found in the 

bulk of gas-phase, thereby requiring that these partial pressures should be obtained from the 

solution of the complete concentration field, perpendicular to the gas flow. Nagel et al. 

proposed an alternative approach to avoid solving the corresponding full set of partial 

differential equations, in which a mass transfer analogy is used to compute the reactant partial 

pressure at the catalyst surface:

suitable correlation

 for the for the geometry and flow conditions considered. 

 

The so-called radial flow reactors or RFR
[ 33]

 are a class of chemical reactors, widely 

used in different scientific and industrial segments. A prominent example of this class is the 

chemical-vapor-deposition (CVD) reactor (axisymmetric, finite-gap stagnation flow reactors are 

also recurrently used to model CVDs, depending on their specific design). In these reactors, 

process gases flow radially outward (or inward) across parallel plates, i.e., “radially diverging 

(or conversing) flow between parallel discs”. The different designs of this type of reactor may 

be studied as radial variations of Jeffery-Hamel flows
[ 411, 33]

, because the application of the 

Jeffery-Hamel similarity represents an often used mathematical simplification of the relatively 

more complex 3D flow in real production reactors. In the specific case of button-type SOFCs, 



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 201 
 

depending on the geometrical design parameters of the fuel channel, the RFR model might be 

used to approximate the flow conditions of the system. In the SOFC literature there are few 

studies
[ 412, 413]

 that have made use of experimental setups resembling the radial flow reactor. 

Nevertheless, the respective numerical simulations of these setups, when available, have been 

accomplished either by means of plug-flow model
[ 414]

 or, more recently, using CFD approach
[ 

415]
.   

Stagnation flow reactor (SFR) models
[ 33]

 seldom have been used by the SOFC 

community to simulate button-cells
[ 416]

. The practical application of these models is more 

common in the simulation of CVD or catalytic combustion bench reactors
[ 417, 34, 418]

. The SFR 

model can be viewed as a similarity reduction of flow equations in a boundary-layer, in which 

the governing and constitutive equations reduce to systems of ODE boundary-value problems.  

What is particularly interesting to note is that, similarly to what is addressed in this section, in 

these other fields (e.g., modeling of CVD processes) there has been discussions on the 

limitations of generally employed models
[ 417]

 for properly describing the physics that occurs 

within the gas channel, depending on the experimental configurations employed. Moreover, 

how the combination between experimental configurations, operating conditions (that, for 

instance, can lead to mass transfer limited chemical reactions), and unsuitable mathematical 

models can result in illusive conclusions, such as the “masking” of real reaction rates and 

kinetic parameters
[ 34]

. That is, how mass transfer effects can mask the intrinsic reactivity at 

typical gas-phase conditions. Thus, depending on the specific goals of a research work, is of 

utmost importance verifying if more accurate models, such as those based on boundary-layer 

approximations, are indeed necessary and “oversimplified” descriptions, such as plug-flow 

models, should be abandoned accordingly. 

It is relevant mention that the boundary-layer models as usually found in the literature 

are set for conditions wherein there is no net mass exchange in the gas-phase (e.g. , the SFR 

model is based on the Hiemenz equations with no-slip velocity boundary condition at the wall). 

Thus, if one expects   ?,  
    to have an important effect on the boundary-layer hydrodynamics 

(i.e., coupling of mass transport and momentum equations), these models will need 

modification.  

 

As already introduced in §§4.3.2, Kulikovsky
[ 255]

 developed an analytical model that 

takes into account the effect of fuel utilization along the gas channel of a planar SOF C anode 

(see Fig. 3.8), under the assumption of plug-flow conditions. This model is based on the 



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 202 
 

framework described in §§4.3.1 and in APPENDIX A. The    consumption in the channel was 

described by the following bass balance equation: 

  
   2
  

= ?
 

2      
   ,   2  = 0 =   2

    ,  
 (4.73) 

 

where      is the height of the channel. This ODE was rewritten in a dimensionless form as: 

        ?   
  ?

  ?
= ?

 ?    ?   ?

   ?  ( ?    ?? )
  ?

   ,  ?  ? = 0 = 1 (4.74)

 ? =

  2
    ,  

 ,  ? =
 

     
 ,    ? =

         
   

 (4.75) 

 

where     is the channel length;   2
   is the inlet hydrogen molar concentration;       is given by 

     = ?2           ; the hydrogen stoichiometry       was defined as 

     =
2           2

  

        
 (4.76) 

 

And the overall (or area-specific) current density was evaluated as: 

  ?  = ?  ?   ?
 

0

 (4.77) 

 

The area specific resistivity      accumulates all resistivities, except the anodic one, 

and is assumed to be independent of local cell current and thus independent of  ?. In a similar 

fashion to the developments of the active layer analytical model in §§4.3.1, Kulikovsky 

obtained solutions for Eq. (4.73) in the limiting situations of high and low current density 

regimes (the author also derived their respective polarization curves). For instance, in the case 

of low current density, the solution of Eq. Eq. (4.73) was given as: 

 ?  ? =
1

   ? 
 0?? ?    ? ?       ? (   ?  2? ?   ?

 ?( ?    ?   ?)

 ? =
 ?

   ?  ( ?    ?? )
  ?

=
 ?   ?    ?

   ?  ( ?    ?? )
  ?

 (4.79) 

 

This analytical model developed by Kulikovsky
[ 255]

 should provide a straightforward way to 

rationalize the effect of hydrogen utilization (  ) on the anodic polarization. This model 

indicates that, within both high and low current density regimes, voltage losses increases 

rapidly for fuel utilizations    above 80%, dramatically worsening the anode performance.  



Chapter 4 ? Modeling Techniques in Concentration Polarization 203 
 

Unfortunately, however, there is a critical error in Kulikovsky’s model, utterly 

compromising its validity. More precisely, there is error in the assumption concerning his “Eq. 

(44)”, where the author states that the equipotential condition leads to 

 ? =  ?   ?  ?    =  ?   ?    ? = c        (4.80) 

 

The “equipotentiality assumption” (see §§2.2.2), however, only refers to  ?     as being constant 

and not  ?   ?  ?    .  Indeed, as more fuel is utilized the value of  ?     changes along the gas 

channel and this remains so even if there is no concentration polarization within the porous 

electrode (as has been also assumed in Kulikovsky’s derivations), because  ?     itself is 

evaluated at “bulk gas conditions”.  That is,  ?   =  ?     ?  ?   and it should also have been a 

function of     concentration, e.g., see Eq. (2.15). Thus, in this case Kulikovsky also 

disregarded the influence of steam concentration on both fuel utilization and SOFC 

performance.

The scope of this dissertation has hitherto been mostly limited to the critical review of 

existing modeling techniques, although some novel research developments and results have 

also been presented in Chapter 3 (see §§3.3). For instance, this author’s dissertation 

concluded from thermostatics considerations and macroscale-continuum phenomenological 

equations that the definition of concentration polarization, as commonly found in the literature, 

may contain a series of limitations. It has been also discussed the relative importance of 

oxygen surface ad-ions on the formation of concentration cells when it is compared to the 

more significant concentration gradients of gas species in the porous channels of SOFC 

cathodes. While the reasoning behind this discussion is coherent from the macroscopic point 

of view, the conclusions concerning these surface effects must still be amended. Therefore, as 

for now they should be regarded as thought-provoking insights into the potential influence of 

contact chemistry near the TPB region. 

More generally, this dissertation discussed a number of issues related to the 

mathematical modeling of concentration polarization in high-temperature SOFCs, with focus on 

the relation between the rate of mass transfer of electroactive species and (possible) 

concentration-induced voltage losses, which may arise within the electrochemical cell as a 

result of transport-related limitations. In particular, this research has been motivated by the 

necessity of raising awareness about the theoretical limitations of existing models that are 

presently applied in the technical literature (above all, considering what was discussed in 

§§3.6). In other words, this work has been driven by the seemingly lack of consistency among 

governing equations and constitutive relations, specifically those that are based on a 

phenomenological macroscale-continuum setting. In doing so, this work tried to show that the 

majority of SOFC numerical simulations performed to date, concerning concentration 

polarization, ignore model checking as a critical step for rigorous validation of both simulation 

and experimental results. This insufficient (or inadequate) model checking also reveals, on the 



Chapter 5 ? Conclusions and Outlook 205 
 

other hand, that physical models lack proper scrutiny about their simplifying assumptions and 

thus about their reliability (see, for example, §§A.5). As a result of this, it seems that certain 

detailed multiscale models can behave as much as “black box” models, despite of their 

apparent mathematical complexity (e.g., as it is the case of some articles that have been 

published on recent years, which applied the Lattice-Boltzmann-Method in structure-resolved 

simulations of SOFC porous layers). Thus, from this perspective, to skip model checking 

amounts to bringing about illusory conclusions, which raise confusion and controversial 

perceptions on the apparent success of these models. 

Hopefully, the issues discussed in this work should open up a perspective towards 

needed improvements in the direction of more consistent (and reliable) mathematical models, 

including comprehensive and rigorous comparison between simulations and experimental 

data, a praxis that is presently missing for the type of problems that have been addressed 

herein. When building the necessary models, future developments should offer a theoretical 

assessment of multicomponent mass transfer in the so-called idealized “capillary pore spaces”, 

which are used as an abstraction for the pore-level information in phenomenological models. 

Through a concerted description of what (supposedly) occurs at the pore level, one expects 

that it will make apparent the flagrant oversimplifications (i.e., misrepresentations of transport 

processes) made by several SOFC models, permitting a more accurate picture of cell 

macroscale performance. Due to the aforementioned limitations placed by (possibly) not 

considering physically relevant phenomena in the numerical simulation of SOFCs, it would be 

of great interest to study the following topics in future research projects: 

I. Discuss important issues related to equation physical scaling, when “matching” 

macroscale-continuum and pore-level mesoscale descriptions (i.e., coarse-

graining of subgrid-scale processes in governing equations and closure relations). 

For instance, the effect of mass density variations over distances comparable to 

pore dimensions in the development of macroscale models. 
 

II. Provide a better presentation material and discussion about the “transport regime” 

referred to as hydrodynamic diffusion, clearly differentiating the 

concepts/definitions of self-diffusion, transport diffusion, and mutual diffusion. 
 

III. Provide a better presentation material and discussion about the Knudsen 

“diffusion”, including the importance of the non-maxwellian behavior of fluid 

particles under the effect of surface roughness (pore-wall fractal scaling) within 

the SOFC porous space (i.e., “anomalous Knudsen diffusion”). Moreover, discuss 

the possible influence of Knudsen layer on surface reaction rates (see item “X” 

below). 
 
 
 
 
 



Chapter 5 ? Conclusions and Outlook 206 
 

IV. Properly incorporate the diffusion slip (Kramers-Kistemaker effect) mechanism 

into the modeling framework and discuss its (qualitative and quantitative) 

importance on simulation results (for both porous medium and gas channel 

domains). 
 

V. Verify the consistency (e.g., mass conservativity) of mixture-averaged rules and 

rigorous multicomponent theories on the calculation of diffusion fluxes and 

transport properties (e.g., diffusivities and viscosities) in porous medium systems. 
 

VI. Discuss Fickian formalism considering the presence of wall-effects, chemical 

reactions, and local force fields, aiming at a more physically consistent description 

of non-fickian behaviors (e.g., “corrected Maxwell-Stefan formalism”). Ideally, this 

discussion should include a comparative analysis of multicomponent diffusion 

according to: (i) TIP; (ii) extended non-equilibrium theories; and (iii) kinetic 

theories. 
 

VII. Discuss the “real” significance of convection for transport processes in porous 

membranes, based on the derivation of more rigorous (e.g., extended 

hydrodynamics) macroscopic transport equations for multicomponent rarefied gas 

flows (i.e., “flow in the near-continuum regime”). Discussions about the hypothesis 

of interpenetrating fluid-continua and fluid mixture theories should be considered. 
 

VIII. Provide a better presentation material and discussion about transport coefficients 

in the case of coupled transport mechanisms and consequent cross-effects (e.g., 

chemical viscosity, barodiffusion, shear-induced migration, and so forth). 
 

IX. Discuss other important issues related to macroscale-continuum models, such as: 

(i) the inclusion of spurious mass sources in balance equations during the 

derivation of Jaumann’s entropy equation and its relation to the correct definition 

of mass diffusion fluxes (in terms of an unambiguous frame of reference) in 

different types of mechanically constrained porous membranes; (ii) consistent flux-

matching boundary conditions for chemical reactions on porous-walls (see item 

“XI”); (iii) the scale invariance of entropy production (“extremal entropy principles”) 

and how to perform consistent coarse-graining of subgrid-scale processes when 

deriving macroscale models. 

 

X. Discuss the significance of the Lattice-Boltzmann equation (and thus of the 

Lattice-Boltzmann method) to, in fact, describe phenomena beyond 

hydrodynamics in SOFCs, including a more encompassing analysis of its 

application to multicomponent flows in the transition regime (e.g., the so-called 

multiple-relaxation-time Lattice-Boltzmann methods for micro-flows). 
 

XI. Discuss the characterization of simultaneous fluid transport and chemical reaction 

in multiscale porous media, including key aspects such as: (i) the correct definition 

(and use) of lumped parameters (e.g., the role of tortuosity) in upscaled 

macroscale-continuum models (i.e., in models based on the so-called “effective 

medium theory”); (ii) how to properly account for the presence of adsorption fields 



Chapter 5 ? Conclusions and Outlook 207 
 

on pore-scale through an upscaled, continuum formulation of reaction-transport 

equations; (iii) the pertinence of considering the so-called “Brickman correction” in 

Darcy's law-based constitutive equations, as a way to consistently account for the 

“upscaled effect” of chemical reactions near (or on) the “dead-end” walls of porous 

channels (thus, in this case, also considering a discussion about the correct 

prescription of macroscopic boundary conditions in the presence of 

heterogeneous reactions that results in non-zero Stefan velocities); (iv) the scale 

(microstructure-related) dependence of apparent (upscaled) electrochemical 

reaction rates and their influence on the evaluation of the effective diffusivity of 

gas components in porous media; (v) and, more generally, the upscaling of 

reaction-transport process in porous media with fast and finite-rate kinetics, and 

the potential failure of macroscale-continuum models under the conditions of 

(subgrid) mixing-controlled heterogeneous reactions. 
 

XII. After the above items have been properly addressed and then incorporated into a 

more encompassing mathematical model, one should try to evaluate to what 

extent mass transfer limitations can indeed impact design decisions and thus the 

cost evaluation of SOFC devices.

Equation (3.48) is a nonhomogeneous, 2nd order ODE that can be analytically solved

The Newman-type boundary condition, Eq. (A.2), represents a no-flux condition at the plane 

    , according to Fig. 3.5. The Dirichlet-type boundary condition, Eq. (A.1), represents the 

relationship between the surface potential step (   ) and surface coverage perturbation at the 

TPB. In order to calculate  
   
  

   
 one may apply, for instance, either Eq. (3.38) or (3.40). Thus, if 

one assumes the condition of low surface coverage, then

obtains 

    ?     (    ?      ?

The starting point is the base model as proposed by Kulikovsk
[12]

, which describes the 

processes shown on Fig. 2.10. Here this model is first presented in its original form (with 

respect to the definition given to “ ” by that author), and then modifications and the reasoning 

for such modifications are discussed. In §§2.3.3 and §§2.3.4 it was brought to light a number 

of questions concerning the reaction penetration depth parameter and the meaning of “ ”. At 

this point some of Kulikovsky’s implied assumptions are pinpointed and the conceptual 

“imprecisions” of his model revealed. Analytical models are derived for the particular cases of 

ideal ionic transport and ideal gas-phase transport, and for each of these cases the limiting 

situations of high and low current density are considered for further simplifications. 

Kulikovsky
[12, 107]

 starts with the following system of equations, which governs the active layer 

performance: 

    ( )

  
    

 ( )     
  (     ? )

 
*   (

  ( )

  
 (A.14) 

 

  
  ( )

  
 
     
    

 (A.15) 

 

where   is the coordinate along the active layer thickness (note that on Figure 2.10 it is 

directed from the electrolyte to the anode out layer);   
  is the volumetric exchange current 

density;      is a reference molar concentration of feed gas;   is the reaction order in respect 

to feed gas;   is the half-cell (e.g., anodic) overvoltage;     is the effective conductivity of 

electrolyte phase in the active layer;   is the effective diffusion coefficient of feed gas within 

the porous channels of the active layer; and   is a charge transfer coefficient.  

According to Kulikovsky, Eq. (A.13) expresses the decay of ionic current with   at a rate 

given by Butler–Volmer electrode kinetics (RHS of this equation); Eq. (A.14) states that Ohm's 

law is valid for the electrolyte phase, relating the ionic current to the overvoltage gradient; Eq. 

(A.15) is a material balance that establishes
1
 that the local diffusion flux of feed gas is equal to 

the local electronic current density (        ) to be converted through the half-cell 

electrochemical reaction (molar flux of ions to be converted into free electrons); and the 

stoichiometry factor      in Eq. (A.15) does the conversion of current density to molar flux.

 Kulikovsky did not mention, but it is also implied that the electrolyte boundary is impermeable to feed gas in 

order to derive Eq. (A.15). 



APPENDIX A - Proofs and Derivations 212 
 

The RHS of Eq. (A.13) can be further simplified. The first exponential describes the 

forward electrochemical conversion (e.g., hydrogen oxidation reaction) while the second 

exponential represents the reverse reaction. This reverse reaction lowers the overall rate of 

conversion in near equilibrium situations (   ), when both exponentials in Eq. (A.13) are of 

the same order of magnitude. Now, If one assumes that the active layer operates far from 

equilibrium (i.e.,     (  )? ), then the second exponential may be ignored. Or, alternatively 

and in order to simplify the calculations, the transfer coefficient may be adopted
2
 as     

     . The latter option will be used herein. It is worth while noting that, under the Butler–

Volmer formalism, the constraint       is important within the region of small current 

densities, wherein both exponentials contributes to the activation polarization. At larger 

currents (SOFC “operating far from equilibrium”), however, the second exponential is negligible 

and hence the value of   in Eq. (A.13) is of minor importance, even though it should still be 

consistent (that is, its value is not arbitrary, as asserted by some authors in the literature). 

Equation (A.13) can now be rewritten as: 

    ( )

  
    

  (     ? )
 
[   (    ? )     (     ? )]       

  (     ? )
 
    (    ? ) (A.16) 

 

Where 

    
   

   
 (A.17) 

 

is the Tafel slope. To nondimensionalize Eq. (A.14), (A.15), and (A.16), the following 

dimensionless variables are introduced: 

 ?  
 

  
    ?  

 

   
    ?  

 

  
    ?   

      
       

 (A.18) 

 

where    is the feed gas concentration at the active layer/outlet layer interface (at    ?   , 

according to Fig, 2.10). Note that hereafter the subscripts “ ” and “ ” will mark the values at 

 ?    and  ?   , respectively. With these variables, equations are now written as

 There are also physical justifications on why this is a good approximation under certain (realistic) operating 

conditions

 (A.22) 

 

is the dimensionless Newman’s reaction penetration depth or RPD
[67]

.This parameter 

indicates, under ideal transport conditions of gas species, how deep the reaction penetrates 

into the electrode (see §§2.3.3). In dimensional form it is expressed as 

   ?       (    
 )?  (A.23) 

 

The dimensionless effective diffusion coefficient of feed gas is given by 

 ?  
         
       

 (A.24) 

 

Boundary conditions for the system (A.19)-(A.21) are 

  ? ( ?   )   ?  
    

       
    ? ( ?   )    (A.25) 

 

 ?( ?   )    (A.26) 

 

The system of equations (A.19)-(A.21), which is controlled by three main parameters 

(   ?, and  )?, describes the spatial distribution of state variables (ionic current, overvoltage, gas 

concentration, and the rate of electrochemical reaction) in the active layer. From the point of 

view of SOFC electrochemical performance, the polarization curve of the active layer, 

expressed though the relation  ?   ? ( )?, is what constitutes the main goal of the cell modeling 

when it is applied to describe the cell behavior in response to various values of   and  ?. The 

“total” voltage loss (polarization) is given by the value of    at the active layer/electrolyte 

interface. The shape of the reaction rate,   
 ( ), is also relevant in that it might support the 

optimization of catalyst design (e.g., load distribution in terms of           ) within the 

electrode. Even though analytical solution for the system (A.19)-(A.21) is as yet unknown, for 

the two limiting cases of (i) ideal ionic transport or (ii) ideal gas-phase transport explicit 

analytical solutions can be derived. 

 

 

In the case of ideal ionic transport, Kulikovsky assumes that the overvoltage gradient is 

vanishing small (  ?   ) and thus that, in the system (A.19)-(A.21), the approximation  ?   ?  

is valid (in §§2.3.4 it was shown that this assumption is not consistent at all). Consequentially, 

in this simplified model Eq. (A.20) is disregarded. The following system results: 

   
  ?  
  ?

  ( ?  ?   ? )
 
     ?  (A.27) 

 



APPENDIX A - Proofs and Derivations 214 
 

 ? 
  ?

  ?
  ?    ?  (A.28) 

 

It is also assumed that the electrochemical reaction is of first-order with respect to feed gas 

(   ). Differentiating Eq. (A.27) with respect to  ? and substituting the term   ?   ??  in Eq. 

(A.28) yields 

    ? 
  ? 

    ( ?   ?  )     ? ( )   ?     ? ( )    (A.29) 

 

where the characteristic length   is 

  ?
     ? 

    ?     ?
 (A.30) 

 

The solution of Eq. (A.29) is
[12]

 

  ? ( ?)   ? (  
    (  ?)

     
) (A.31) 

 

And then solving Eq. (A.27) for  ?, the solution is
[12]

 

 ?( ?)   (
    ?   

     ? 
)
   ? 
  ?

  
 

  ?   
 
  ?  
  ?

 (A.32) 

 

After differentiating Eq. (A.31) and substituting it in the result above, one has 

 ?( ?)  
 ?    (  ?)

 ?       
 (A.33) 

 

For the dimensionless rate of electrochemical oxidation one finds that: 

 ?  ( ?)   
  ?  
  ?

 
  ?     (  ?)

     
 

 
      ?  ( ?)   ?  

   ?( ?) 

(A.34) 

 

It is readily seen that, in the case of ideal ionic transport, the shape of  ?  ( ?) closely 

follows that of  ?( ?), as depicted in Fig. A-1. When the gas diffusivity is relatively small (i.e., 

large  ) electrochemical conversion occurs within a small region near the active layer/outer 

layer interface, in which the reacting gas is, still, in excess (see Fig. A-1). Kulikovsky proposes 

a characteristic length for this region, defined as: 

 ?  
 

 
  ?

 ?  ?    

     ? 
 (A.35) 

Nonetheless, that author does not indicate the considerations used to obtain this relation. It is 

only mentioned that the quantity  ?  follows from Eq. (A.34), considering that this equation 

dictates the rate of decay of  ?  ( ?). Most likely, Kulikovsky developed the following rationale: 



APPENDIX A - Proofs and Derivations 215 
 

  ?   ? ( ?)   ? ( )  (
  ?  
  ?

)

  

( ?  ( ?)   ?  ( ))  
 

     (  ?)
 

 

                ?            (  ?)          ?    ?   
 

 
 

(A.36) 

 

Thus we see that this characteristic length, for the case of ideal ionic transport, is not generally 

valid and it is applicable only for large values of   (see also Eq. (A.45)). Finally, the polarization 

curve of the active layer can be obtained by setting  ?    (thus  ?   ) in Eq. (A.33): 

 ?   ?                    ( ? )  (A.37) 

 

 

Figure A-1: diffusion-limited case (large     ): profiles of ionic current density   ? , feed gas concentration  ?, 
overvoltage  ?, and rate of electrochemical conversion  ?   within the active layer. Parameters used:  ?     ; 
 ?     ;    ;  ?   ;  ?     . 

 

In the particular case of Fig. A-1, the corresponding value of  ?  is     , when this is 

evaluated using Eq. (A.35). However, by inspecting Fig. A-1 one verifies that this value does 

not seem to be consistent at all: instead, one should have that  ?         . The likely reason 

for such discrepancy is because Eq. (A.35) is an asymptotic result; whereas the modeling 

equations applied by Kulikovsky had not assumed this asymptotic limit in their derivations. 

Simulations indicate, for the situation depicted in Fig. A-1, the necessity of        in order to 

Eq. (A.35) provide reasonable values. Alternatively, a better way to estimate  ?  would be to 

define some objective criterion for the decay of  ?  . For instance,  ?  may be defined as the 

length above which the rate  ?   falls below 1% of its initial value (at  ?   ). Thus, in this case, 

one finds that   ?      . For this kind of definition, the following alternative expression could 

be utilized:

In the low current regime,         and Eq. (A.37) reduces to  ?   ?  ? . Using Eq. 

(A.30) the polarization curve is now given by  

 ?        ( ?     
   )?   (A.39) 

 

Note that  ? does not appear in this relation. In this case, a small   implies that    is also small 

or, alternatively, that the diffusion coefficient is large (assuming that electrode kinetics is the 

same in both cases). Thus, the gas transport does not contribute to the voltage loss in this 

limiting case. Using Eq. (A.39) and Eq. (A.35), the characteristic thickness of the reacting 

region is 

 ?  ? ?  ??  
or in 

dimensional form, 
   ?           ?  (A.40) 

 

Therefore, the validity of the low-current approximation may be conditionally expressed as: 

       ? ?  ??        ?        (A.41) 

 
   

In the high current regime,         and Eq. (A.37) reduces to  ?   ?  . Using Eq. 

(A.30) the polarization curve is now given by  

 ?        ( ?     
   ?   ?? )   (A.42) 

 

Additionally, if  ? ?    ?  then the argument of         in Eq. (A.42) is large and thus one may 

apply the approximation             . In this case, 

 ?      (   ? ?   ?    ??  )  
or in 

dimensional form,

Equation (A.43) exhibits the so-called double (or doubled) Tafel slope. The term         is a 

characteristic current threshold value, called “critical current density”, defined as: 

        ?  
           

     ?    (A.44) 

 

Using Eq. (A.42) and Eq. (A.35), the characteristic thickness of the reacting region is 

calculated as 

 ?   ?  ??  
or in 

dimensional form, 
             ?  (A.45) 



APPENDIX A - Proofs and Derivations 217 
 
 

Therefore, the validity of the high-current approximation may be conditionally expressed as: 

            ?    
   ?     ?     ?    ?   (A.46) 

 

 

For the case of ideal gas transport, Kulikovsky
[12,107]

 assumes that the feed gas 

concentration gradient is vanishing small (  ?   ) and thus that, without loss of generality, one 

could set  ?   ?      and disregard Eq. (A.21). The following simplified system would result: 

   
  ?  
  ?

       ? (A.47) 

 

  ?   
  ?

  ?
 (A.48) 

 

And the boundary conditions for this system are also given by Eq. (A.25). Differentiating Eq. 

(A.47) with respect to  ?, using Eq. (A.48), and knowing that hyperbolic sine and cosine satisfy 

the known identify      ( ?)       ( ?)   , one obtains:

(A.49) 

 

In the liming cases of (i) small and (ii) large current densities, Eq. (A.49) can be analytically 

solved. 

 

In order to solve Eq. (A.49) in the low current limit, Kulikovsky neglected the term 

multiplying    ?   ??  altogether. However, although in this case the current density   ?is assumed 

to be small, the current gradient might not be so (e.g., if the active layer happens to be very 

thin). Moreover, the fourth power of the term   could be comparatively large as well (see Eq. 

(A.22)): 

   (

 (A.50) 

The product      ?   ??  scales with the square of    ? . Thus, even though   is small, in the case 

when the layer is very thin their combined effect might not be negligible. Thus, one verifies that 



APPENDIX A - Proofs and Derivations 218 
 

the condition of low current is not enough to discard    ?   ??  on the RHS of Eq. (A.49). A 

condition such as: 

 

  
      

  or, 
 

    
 
     or still, 

 

       
 
    (A.51) 

 

would be required
3
. All in all, neglecting      ?   ??  from Eq. (A.49) gives: 

   
    ?

   ?       ? ( ?   )   ?     ? ( ?   )    (A.52)

 (A.55) 

 

In this case of low cell current densities, the characteristic scale of all profiles is given 

by Newman’s RPD  . Meaning that, for large  , the characteristic length scale of  ?   and  ? 

greatly exceeds the active layer thickness (see Fig. A-2). On the other hand, small   means 

high exchange current density (  
 ), which makes possible to convert the ionic current close to 

the electrolyte without significant voltage loss. Thus, for small   there is a rapid decay in the 

profiles of   ? ,  ?  , and  ? (see the top plot in Fig. A-2).

 Alternatively, Kulikovsky

[12]
 has also provided a validity condition in the low-current limit, expressed by the 

inequality   ?      (   ? ).

The result of Eq. (A.60), widely applied in the literature, is thus based on the assumptions of 

Tafel kinetics, uniform reaction rate distribution, and on a moderated-to-low exchange current 

density. 

 

In order to solve Eq. (A.49) in the high current limit, Kulikovsky
[12]

 neglected the first 

term on the RHS. Thus (note that as    ?   ??    and the function is monotonic, the negative

     ? (   ?)?       ?     (    )?  (A.69) 

 

One verifies that the profiles of  (? ?) and  ?  ( ?) do not depend on   and they contain only one 

parameter,   , which is itself function only of  .? Thus in the high current limit these profiles do 

not depend on Newman’s RPD. In place of that, the characteristic thickness decreases with 

the growth of the cell current  .? It can be shown that

Therefore, the dominating factor in the limit of high current densities is the poor ionic

conversion takes place close to the electrolyte, where the losses associated with ion tra nsport 

are lower (see Fig. A-3). A simplified polarization curve for this case was also derived as

Equation (A.72) exhibits a doubled Tafel slope, indicating that when there is poor ionic 

conductivity the electrochemical conversion “is forced” to occur close to the electrolyte 

interface (in order to minimize ohmic losses). Thus, in this case there is a consequent shift of 

the on-set overvoltage, i.e. a change of the value  (   ). Kulikovsky
[12]

 did also provide a 

condition for the validity of the high-current approximation, expressed by the inequality 

  ?        (   ? ).

Apparently, there is an inconsistency in “Eq. [26]” of Kim et al.
[82]

, pp 73. The anodic 

and cathodic concentration polarization terms were not divided by the partial pressure of the 

hydrogen from the fuel stream (outside of the anode) and by the partial pressure of the oxygen 

from the oxidant stream, (outside of the cathode), respectively. The issue appears to be 

related to the definition of concentration polarization. They have stated with their “Eq. [26]” that 

(here neglecting the ohmic and activation polarizations, so to simplify the discussion) 

     ( )   
          

 ( )  |        
 ( )| (A.74) 

 

However, it should have been expressed as 

     ( )      
             ( )  |        ( )| (A.75) 

 

Considering that when    ,       corresponds to the open-circuit limit, i.e. 

     (   )      
        

  

  
  (

   
        

      ?

              |        |

)  

  

  
  (

    
      

    
   
 
) 

(A.77) 

 

From Kim et al.
[82]

, the concentration polarization was defined as (pp. 73): 

        
   

  

  
  (   

          )  
  

  
  (    

          )

) (A.78)

     (
     

    

 
)     +  

  

  
  (

 

 
  

   
) (A.79) 

 

After substituting Eq. (A.78) and (A.79) in Eq. (A.77), one has that (also assuming     ) 

 
  

  
  (

    
   

   
   

)  
  

  
  (

 

   
   
)   

   

  
  (

      
   

  

    
   
 
)  

  

  
  (

    

    
   
 
) (A.80) 

 

which leaves one with a consistent result in this regard. Thus, one sees that Kim and 

coauthors indeed have applied a different definition of concentration polarization in their “Eq. 

[26]”, when compared to that of Eq. (3.7) and (3.12). The difference is 



APPENDIX A - Proofs and Derivations 224 
 

         
                   

  
  

  
  (   

        
    ? ) 

 

         
  |        |  |        

 |  
  

  
  (   

    ) 

          
      

     (A.81) 

 

Therefore, Kim et al. in [82] “discounts” the value of the cell reversible voltage (    
    ) 

from the concentration polarization. Such peculiar choice of definition seems, though possible, 

quite strange. Moreover, the argument inside the exponential is, based on their definition, Eq. 

(A.79), not dimensionless, thereby constituting a physical inconsistency (even though it is 

mathematically acceptable). For that it is often recommended to use the chemical activity (or 

fugacity coefficients at the chosen reference pressure) until substitution of dimensional values 

in the final result. Either way, the definition proposed by Kim et al.
[82]

, according to Eq. (A.78) 

and (A.79), is conceptually incompatible when compared to the definition of concentration 

polarization as established by Eq. (3.7) and (3.12). Nevertheless, at the end of their paper the 

authors have changed the definition of      , more precisely in their “Eq. 36” and “Eq. 45”, but 

they have not included  any reasoning for such change.

Equation (4.47a) (i.e., axial momentum balance within the gas channel) can be written 

in a more general form as: 

 (   )

  
    (   ?    )     [

  

  
  ?      ( )]    [

  

  
    (  ? )] (A.82) 

 

Equation (4.47a) is identical to Eq. (A.82) if and only if the first term on the RHS of Eq. (A.82) 

is identically zero, so that the continuity equation is verified: 

         [
  

  
    (  ? )]    

  
  

 [?    ? 
 

 ] (A.83) 

 

Then, 

  [
  

  
  ?      ( )]          

  

  
    

  

  
   (A.84) 

 

In other words, the above result represents a tacit imposition in that the substantial (or 

material) derivative is zero, 

   
  

  
   [

  

  
  ?      ( )]    (A.85) 

 

One can also express Eq.  (A.85) as: 

  
  

  
  
 (         )

  
  
      

  
 
      
  

   ?     (A.86) 

 

Therefore, the implied assumption is that both the pressure gradient and shear stress 

change are either zero, negligible small, or that they balance (cancel) each other out. 

Moreover, any eventual source term   ?  must be also either zero, negligible small, or it must 

balance the other remaining parcels of Eq. (A.86). From Eq. (A.84), in the steady-state, one 

also has that 

  
  

  
   (A.87) 

 

Thus  ( )        ,   . In this case the axial velocity is constant throughout the gas channel 

and thus solving an additional momentum equation would not be necessary
4
 (e.g.,   is 

completely defined by specifying the inflow mass flux). Therefore, the axial momentum 

equation in Janardhanan et al.
[298]

 is really an artifact introduced by the under-relaxation 

procedure used for the numerical solution of the system of equations. 

                                                      
4
 Note that if the mean gas composition varies in the (mean) flow direction, the viscosity   may also vary axially 

along the channel length. Therefore, in the general case, the mean wall shear stress may also not be constant 
throughout the channel.

The “extended version” of Bosanquet formula provided in Table 4.15
[313]

, when 

compared to its classical form
[62]

, is a artifice a few authors in the literature have been using as 

a “non-rigorous” method to avoid the violation of gas species mass conservation. Although the 

conditions under which it should be applied, its apparent validity, and its mathematical 

derivation has not been openly discussed (e.g., see [72, 313]), it is most likely that the use of 

an “averaged Bosanquet diffusion coefficient” is justified in the cases where the assumption of 

constant total pressure is incorrectly enforced in the presence of chemical reactions (which, in 

this case, produce a net change in the total number density of gas species). Below it is given a 

possible explanation for the origin for such “corrected formula” for the case of a ternary gas 

mixture.  

The simpler EPDM model of Virkar and coauthors (see §§ 4.4.2) will be employed in 

this attempt of explanation, starting from Eq. (4.15a), (4.15b), and (4.18), which at this point 

assume that the microstructure of porous electrodes is not a function of position and thus that 

   
    is composition-independent. As the saturation current is also a function of the hydrogen 

concentration at bulk conditions, it is convenient to define an effective anodic transport 

multiplier (   ) as: 

    
   

   
   
 (

    
     

       
)
   

 ?
   
 ( )

   ( )     ( )

   

 

    (A.88) 

 

with 

   
    

       

   
 

 
   

[   
     (       )? ]   

 (A.89) 

 

The factor     is akin to that of Virkar
[82]

, with the exception that in this case the diffusion 

coefficient is also admitted to be a function of position (i.e.,     is not composition-independent 

and thus it might also vary along the layer thickness). It is an approximate average based on 

the “mean value” of    
  (       )?  in the interval [     ]. By assuming only diffusive mass 

transport mechanism, from Eq. (4.14), (4.41), and (A.88) one may express the limiting molar 

flux as 

 ?       
    
  

 
   
    

      
 (   )

     
     (A.90) 

 

The factor     may be seen as the reciprocal of an “effective mass transfer coefficient” in the 

very special situation (or rather, assumption) in which the interfacial partial pressure of 

hydrogen reaches zero at current saturation condition (i.e., zero gas concentration at the 



APPENDIX A - Proofs and Derivations 227 
 

anode/electrolyte interface). If one now defines    
       (  )? , Eq. (A.88) and (A.89) can 

be rewritten as: 

   
   

    
        

     (A.91) 

 

    
   

     
        

     (A.92) 

 

For a ternary gas system under approximately constant total pressure (there is an 

error in this assumption), the composition profile of an inert gas (e.g.,   ,   ,    ) may 

calculated as
[82]

: 

 
 

  

       
  

 
 ?     

      
  

 
    ?             ?  
(      

 ? )         
 
     ?             ?   

(      
 ? )           

 (A.93) 

 

Because the net flow of the inert gas is zero ( ?       ) and  ?     ?    in steady state 

(another common misleading assumption made in the literature), Eq. (A.93) becomes 

 
 

  

       
  

 
 ?  

(      
 ? )

(
 

          
 

 

         
)       (A.94) 

 

Integration of Eq. (A.94) gives 

      
   

       
       *

    ?      

  (      
 ? )

(
 

         
 

 

          
)+ (A.95) 

 

Or yet as a function of the position along layer thickness, 

      ( )        
       *

    ?   

  (      
 ? )

(
 

         
 

 

          
) + (A.96) 

 

Thus        varies exponentially as a function of position and this variation along the electrode 

may not be (aprioristically) assumed to be negligible small (insignificant). Therefore, this 

aspect should be taken into consideration in the evaluation of    diffusion coefficient when it is 

not independent of position. Similarly to the case of inert gas in Eq. (A.94), one can write for    

 
 

  

    
  

 
 ?  

(      
 ? )

(
 

   
  
 
      ( )

         
 
        ( )

       
) (A.97) 

 

Or, alternatively, in a similar form to Fick’s Law: 

 ?    
 

  
 
   

   
 
   

    
  

 (A.98) 

 

where     can be defined as the    “bulk” multicomponent diffusion coefficient for the ternary 

system              (in the absence of a porous body), and expressed as: 

    (
 

   
  
 
      ( )

         
 
        ( )

       
)

  

 (A.99) 



APPENDIX A - Proofs and Derivations 228 
 
 

Now using the result of Eq. (A.88) one can write 

   
    

   
   

 
   

   
 
(

   ( )

) (A.102) 

 

Where the boundary condition Eq. (4.14) has been substituted in  ?   . The integration 

parameter   (   ) may be understood as the reciprocal of a mass transport penetration depth, 

that is, the dimensionless quantity      indicates “how deep the inert gas concentration profile 

penetrates into the electrode”. In Eq. (A.91) and (A.92) the factor    
  is calculated using Eq. 

(A.100): 

However, unfortunately, Eq. (4.15) and (4.16) from the work of Virkar
[82]

 (and thus, as a 

consequence, Eq. (A.91) and (A.92)) must be corrected (“normalized”) for the limiting case 

when        and

have       
   

       
   

. Virkar and coauthors have neglected this aspect in [259] and made a 

mistake because they did not use the correct effective diffusion coefficient in the     mass 

balance. Thus, their equivalent to equation Eq. (4.16) is in error and violates mass 

conservation. Moreover, Eq. (4.25) is also incorrect and must be fixed!

The result above is consistent with Eq. (A.96) and (A.102) if and only if one assumes

constant (i.e.,     ) in the derivation of Eq. (A.93). Thus, based on Eq. (A.95)
