RESUMO 

 

BARBOSA, Bianca Moreira, M.Sc., Universidade Federal de Viçosa, julho de 2013. 

Avaliação da qualidade de materiais lignocelulósicos e produção de furfural a partir do 
sabugo de milho, bagaço da cana-de-açúcar, madeira de eucalipto e pré-hidrolisado da 

produção de polpa para dissolução. Orientador: Jorge Luiz Colodette.  

 

Esse trabalho está apresentado em duas partes distintas, sendo a primeira focalizada na 

qualidade da madeira de eucalipto cultivada sob diferentes regimes de ferti-irrigação para 

produção de celulose (Capítulo 1) e a segunda na avaliação preliminar da qualidade da 

madeira de eucalipto e de outras matérias-primas, tais como bagaço da cana-de-açúcar, 

sabugo de milho e licor de eucalipto do processo pré-hidrólise Kraft de produção de polpa 

solúvel, para a produção de furfural (Capítulo 2).  O grande interesse em madeira de eucalipto 

vem de seu baixo custo de produção em regiões tropicais, principalmente devido à alta 

produtividade florestal. O melhoramento genético associado ao adequado manejo florestal 

(fertilização, irrigação) se destaca como ferramenta importante na produção de madeira de 

alta qualidade e de baixo custo. O objetivo do Capítulo 1 foi avaliar o efeito do regime de 

ferti-irrigação na composição química e massa específica básica da madeira de clones do 

Eucalyptus spp. e suas possíveis consequências na produção de polpa celulósica. Quatro 

clones foram avaliados, sendo dois da espécie Eucalyptus grandis e os outros dois 

provenientes dos híbridos de Eucalyptus grandis x Eucalyptus urophylla, com a idade de 72 

meses. Os tratamentos avaliados foram 2 níveis de adubação, o Tradicional não irrigado 

(T/NI) e o Ferti-irrigado (F/I), além do tratamento Controle (C/NI), onde não foi utilizado 

nenhum tipo de adubo ou irrigação, tendo cada tratamento 3 repetições, totalizando 36 

amostras. Os resultados indicaram diferença estatística significativa para massa específica 

básica, teor de manganês, relação siringila/guaiacila da lignina e teor de grupos acetila das 

madeiras, e similaridade para teor de carboidratos, lignina total, ácidos urônicos, extrativos, 

cinzas, Fe, Ca e Mg. Conclui-se que a técnica de ferti-irrigação, apresentou alguns aspectos 

negativos no que tange à qualidade da madeira de certos clones de eucalipto, sendo relevante 

considerar os seus impactos no processo produtivo de fabricação de polpa celulósica. No 

Capítulo 2, considerando o conceito de biorrefinaria é possível a integração dos processos de 

produção de celulose aos de materiais, produtos químicos e combustíveis, a partir de biomassa 

lignocelulósica.  Por exemplo, derivados de furano, tais como o 5-hidroximetilfurfural (HMF) 

e furfural originários de biomassa, têm potencial para substituir derivados do petróleo na 

fabricação de químicos finos e de plásticos.  Foi estudado o efeito de diferentes concentrações 



vi 

 

(1,5-5,2 mol.L-1) dos ácidos minerais, ácido clorídrico (HCl), ácido sulfúrico (H2SO4) e ácido 

fosfórico (H3PO4) na produção de furfural por hidrodestilação do sabugo de milho, bagaço da 

cana-de-açúcar e madeira de eucalipto. Foi também avaliado o licor pré-hidrolisado da 

madeira de eucalipto, proveniente do processo pré-hidrólise Kraft de fabricação de polpa 

solúvel para a produção de furfural, utilizando ácido sulfúrico e ácido clorídrico como 

catalisadores. Os resultados mostraram que a produção de furfural foi fortemente influenciada 

pela concentração e tipo de ácido mineral e pela matéria-prima. As maiores produtividades de 

furfural, com base no peso seco da biomassa, foram de 30,2% para o sabugo de milho e 

25,8% para o bagaço da cana-de-açúcar, ambos utilizando HCl 5,2 mol.L-1, para a madeira de 

eucalipto, a produtividade foi de 13,9% usando HCl 3,9 mol.L-1. O rendimento de conversão 

de pentoses para furfural usando o licor pré-hidrolisado do eucalipto foi de 71,5%, utilizando 

HCl 3,9 mol.L-1. Foi concluído que o uso de ácidos minerais como catalisadores por 

hidrodestilação é adequado para a produção de furfural a partir de resíduos lignocelulósicos 

oriundos de processos industriais.

ABSTRACT  

 

BARBOSA, Bianca Moreira, M.Sc., Universidade Federal de Viçosa, July, 2013. Assessment 
of lignocellulosic materials quality and furfural production from corn cobs, sugarcane 

bagasse, eucalyptus wood and dissolving pulp pre-hydrolyzate. Adviser: Jorge Luiz 

Colodette. 

 

This work is presented in two distinct parts, the first focused on the quality of 

eucalyptus wood grown for pulp production under different ferti-irrigation systems (Chapter 

1) and the second on the preliminary assessment of the quality of eucalyptus wood and other 

materials for the production of furfural such as sugarcane bagasse, corn cobs and pre-

hydrolyzed eucalyptus from the pre-hydrolysis Kraft process for dissolving pulp production 

(Chapter 2). The great interest in eucalyptus wood comes from its low cost of production in 

some regions, mainly due to high forest productivity. Genetic improvements associated with 

appropriate forest management (fertilization, irrigation, etc.) stand out as important tools in 

the production of wood of high quality and low cost. The goal of Chapter 1 was to evaluate 

the effect of the ferti-irrigation regime on the chemical composition and specific basic mass of 

wood from clones of the Eucalyptus spp. and possible consequences on the production of 

cellulose pulp. Four clones were evaluated, two being from the species Eucalyptus grandis 

and the other two coming from hybrids of Eucalyptus grandis x Eucalyptus urophylla, with 

age of 72 months. The treatments were evaluated with two levels of fertilization, the 

Traditional no irrigated (T/NI) and Ferti-irrigation (F/I), and a treatment Control no irrigated 

(C/NI), which was to not use any fertilizer or irrigation, with each treatment having three 

replicates, totaling 36 samples. The results indicated statistically significant differences for 

specific basic mass , manganese, lignin syringyl/guaiacyl ratio and acetyl group content of the 

woods, and similarity in carbohydrate, total lignin, uronic acids, extractives, ash, Fe, Ca and 

Mg. We conclude that the technique of ferti-irrigation presented some negative aspects 

regarding the quality of the wood of certain eucalyptus clones, it being relevant to consider 

their impacts on the production process for manufacturing cellulose pulp. In Chapter 2, 

considering the biorefinery concept it is possible to integrate the processes of pulp production 

to those of materials, chemicals and fuels from lignocellulosic biomass.  For example, furan 

derivatives, such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and furfural originating from biomass 

have the potential to replace petroleum in the manufacture of fine chemicals and plastics. The 

effect was studied of different concentrations (1.5 to 5.2 mol.L-1) of mineral acids, 

hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and phosphoric acid (H3PO4) on the 



viii 

 

production of furfural by hydro distillation of corn cob, sugarcane bagasse and eucalyptus 

wood. The liquor from the pre-hydrolysis Kraft process for dissolving pulp production was 

also assessed for furfural production, using sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid as catalysts. 

The results showed that the production of furfural was strongly influenced by the 

concentration and type of mineral acid and the raw material. The highest productivity of 

furfural, based on the dry weight biomass were 30.2% for corn cobs and 25.8% for the 

sugarcane bagasse, both using HCl 5.2 mol.L-1, for eucalyptus wood, the yield was 13.9% 

using 3.9 mol.L-1 HCl. The yield of conversion of pentose to furfural using the eucalyptus pre-

hydrolysis liquor was 71.5% using HCl 3.9 mol.L-1. It was concluded that using mineral acids 

as catalysts for hydro distillation is suitable for the production of furfural from lignocellulosic 

wastes originating from industrial processes.

INTRODUCTION 

The world economy is currently undergoing major changes that have been 

increasingly influenced by climate change that the planet is passing through. The current need 

to seek renewable and alternative energy has led to the development of various technologies. 

Processing industries correspond to the main targets of these technologies, which in addition 

to seeking cleaner energy sources, have also invested efforts in search of the better use of 

natural resources, increasing process efficiency while reducing pressure on planted areas. 

Studies to correlate the use of a cleaner energy matrix and the increase in the use efficiency of 

natural resources have yet to relate these two factors to the quality assurance of the final 

product, which makes this new vision of development included in the production sectors even 

more challenging. 

In virtue of adequate climate, large areas available for cultivation technologies for 

advanced agricultural and forest production and an excellent adaptation of certain crops under 

the tropical climate, the costs of biomass in Brazil are quite low compared with other parts of 

the world. Various clones of the genus Eucalyptus are continuously improved and cultivated 

in order to provide the most suitable raw material for production, according to the evaluation 

criteria of quality wood. 

The wood quality is the factor that determines its market value and its applications in 

various industrial segments. For the cellulose and paper sector, wood quality has been 

described primarily through its physical properties such as specific basic mass and chemical 

composition. Thus, there is a need to study how these factors are affected throughout the 

growth of the tree. In general, it is found that the properties of wood are dependent on 

genetics, growth conditions and the age of the tree. Fertilization techniques can be used 

during tree growth to improve its development, but the effect of fertilization on the chemical 

composition of the wood has not yet been fully elucidated. 

Chapter 1 discusses the effects of ferti-irrigation on the chemical composition of the 

wood and its specific basic mass in clones of the genus Eucalyptus spp., assessing its possible 

consequences on cellulose production. The evaluation of these factors helps in understanding 

the properties required for cellulose production and biomaterials production, its constitution 

being relevant for determining its final destination. 

Lignocellulosic biomass is a renewable and available resource, which needs to be 

further explored, and the manufacture of products with high added value from biomass, is an 

important option to be pursued. Decreased dependence on fossil fuel reserves, through the 



2 

 

intensive use of renewable materials, boosts rural development, and heads towards a modern 

sustainable society. 

The possibility of cellulose production process integration with those of biomaterials 

came about from the concept of biorefineries. This new line of worldwide research seeks 

more rational use of fibrous materials, favoring the extraction of the various components of 

natural resources, minimizing waste generation and contemplating the use of the 

multiproducts generated. 

The use of eucalyptus in the cellulose and paper industry is well established. However, 

the possibility of using grasses to add value to that industry, using the new biorefinery 

concept, has been widely studied. Fibrous materials such as bagasse and straw (composed of 

the sugarcane leaf and apical portion of the stem) of sugarcane, bamboo and corn cobs have 

good hemicellulose values in their constitution. These residues materials, being available from 

agricultural biomass and forestry processing, constitute a potential source for the production 

of chemicals such as ethanol, sugars and furfural, using enzymes or by acid-catalyzed 

hydrolysis.   

The interest in the production of chemicals from renewable resources has increased in 

the last decade in direct relation to the declining reserves and rising prices of fossil fuels. The 

use of renewable raw materials, biomass in particular, is a good option as a new economic and 

environmental alternative. In this regard, furan derivatives, such as furfural and 5-

hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) can be produced from the acid catalyzed dehydration of 

pentoses and hexoses, respectively, contained in lignocellulosic biomass (such as corn cobs 

and cotton). These compounds have the potential to be sustainable substitutes for 

petrochemicals used in the production of fine chemicals and plastics. 

 Chapter 2 addresses the use of different mineral acids for the conversion of pentose, 

from lignocellulosic materials, into furfural. Among the lignocellulosic materials used, there 

is the corn cob, sugarcane bagasse and eucalypt wood, which are wastes from agroindustrial 

processes, besides trying to produce furfural from the eucalyptus liquor from pre-hydrolysis 

Kraft dissolving pulp production, which is rich in pentoses. 

This study aimed to: assess the quality of Eucalyptus spp. under the influence of ferti-

irrigation treatments to produce cellulose, in addition to a review of the effect of hydrochloric, 

sulfuric and phosphoric acid as a catalyst for the production of furfural associated with 

different lignocellulosic raw materials.

CHAPTER 1 

QUALITY OF EUCALYPTUS SPP.WOOD CULTIVATED UNDER DIFFERENT 

FERTI-IRRIGATION SCHEMES FOR CELLULOSE PRODUCTION 

 

ABSTRACT 

 

 This current paper has the objective of evaluating the effect of two levels of 

fertilization (NPK) on the chemical composition and on the specific basic mass of the wood of 

clones from the Eucalyptus spp., assessing its possible consequences in the production of 

cellulosic pulp. Four clones were evaluated, two of those being of the Eucalyptus grandis 

species and the other two proceeding from hybrids of Eucalyptus grandis x Eucalyptus 

urophylla, at the age of 72 months. The treatments were evaluated with two levels of 

fertilization, the Traditional no irrigated (T/NI) and Ferti-irrigation (F/I), and a treatment 

Control no irrigated (C/NI), which was to not use any fertilizer or irrigation, with each 

treatment having three replicates, totaling 36 samples. The analyzed chemical features were 

associated with the level of fertilization and the type of genetic material at stake. For the 

statistical analysis one used the STATISTICA 7.0 software, where one made the analysis of 

variation and, in the case of significant interaction, there was decomposition through the 

Tukey test, at the level of 5% probability. There was significant difference for the following 

properties: specific basic mass, manganese, lignin syringyl/guaiacyl ratio (S/G) and acetyl 

group content. For the remaining analyzed properties such as carbohydrate content, total 

lignin, uronic acids, extractives, ashes, Fe, Ca and Mg, no statistical difference was noticed. 

We conclude that the technique of ferti-irrigation presented some negative aspects regarding 

the quality of the wood of certain eucalyptus clones, it being relevant to consider their impacts 

on the production process for manufacturing cellulose pulp.  

Keywords: fertilization, chemistry of wood, eucalyptus and specific basic mass. 

 

INTRODUCTION 

The genus Eucalyptus has, as representatives, the most commonly grown species in 

the world, with over 4.75 million hectares in Brazil (Bracelpa, 2013). It is widely employed to 

produce wood for various purposes, due to its rapid growth, good ecological adaptation and 

high versatility. Eucalyptus grandis, along with others such as Eucalyptus urophylla, is one of 

the most studied species. These species generally have satisfactory characteristics to be 

employed for various purposes, particularly for the cellulose and paper industries, hardboard 

and energy use, according to the quality of the wood (Berger, 2002). 

For the cellulose and paper sector, wood quality has been described primarily through 

its physical, chemical and anatomical parameters which are considered as good evaluation 

parameters of its characteristics and of great use in forestry breeding programs. Thus, there is 

a need to study how these factors are affected throughout the growth of the tree. In general, it 

appears that the wood properties depend on genetics, growth conditions and the age of the tree 

(Mellerowicz and Sundberg, 2008; Cooke et al., 2005). Ferti-irrigation techniques may be 



4 

 

used during tree growth to improve its development, because the formation of wood is highly 

sensitive to environmental changes. 

The natural soil characteristics, as well as fertilizer and moisture content, are factors 

that can influence the wood quality. Changes in growth conditions, due to the application of 

fertilizers and the use of irrigation techniques, are often associated with significant changes in 

the quality of the wood. This importance refers to the physical, chemical and anatomical 

attributes (Pitre et al., 2010). However, the effects of ferti-irrigation are difficult to predict; 

some studies indicate an increase, others, to the contrary, show a decline in wood quality 

(Barreiros et al., 2007; Punches and Country, 2004). 

The recommendations for mineral fertilizers used always refer to the elements 

Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium, but very rarely to Boron and Zinc, which are 

recommended for application at planting or as top dressing applied 90 days after planting 

(Barros, 2012). Currently, most commercial plantations are fertilized using virtually the same 

N-P-K (6-30-6), regardless of species, soil type and planting time. 

Nitrogen fertilization is one of the practices that has been most employed to achieve 

increased productivity (Macdonald and Hubert, 2002). Nitrogen is often a limiting factor for 

the growth of terrestrial plants, therefore, the addition of nitrogen-rich fertilizers can have 

profound effects on the physiology of the tree and biomass accumulation (Cooke et al., 2005; 

Gessler et al., 2004.) Changes at the anatomical and compositional levels have often been 

described in relation to N-P-K fertilization, water stress and mechanical stimuli. However, the 

effects of fertilization on wood quality are difficult to predict. 

For the cellulose and paper industry, a proper assessment of specific basic mass  

provides very precise indications about the chip impregnation and process yield and is usually 

associated with quality traits and pulp physical-mechanical resistance. There are few studies 

that directly relate the interference of soil attributes on the quality of forest species (Rigatto et 

al., 2005). In this context, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of ferti-irrigation on the 

chemical composition and specific basic mass of Eucalyptus spp. 

 

MATERIAL AND METHODS 

This study evaluated two fertilization levels, the Traditional no irrigated (T/NI) and 

Ferti-irrigation (F/I), besides the Control (C/NI) treatment, in which fertilization or irrigation 

was not used. Fertilizer applications were made by topdressing applied in three doses per year 

for the first three years. Irrigation was tested only for the F/I treatment in which irrigation was 



5 

 

conducted, in order to maintain an average soil humidity around 15-30 mm. This procedure 

was performed twice every seven days, in order to maintain moisture from precipitation and 

compensate for evapotranspiration. 

Table 1 shows the types of treatments and their respective amounts of chemicals per 

hectare. The C/NI treatment was not added in the table, since there was no fertilization and 

irrigation.

The eucalyptus species used were: Eucalyptus grandis (Clones A and B) and hybrids 

of Eucalyptus grandis x Eucalyptus urophylla (Clones A and B), originating from the city of 

Guanhães in the state of Minas Gerais. The trees used were 72 months old and were taken 

from the same 30 x 30 m planting parcel, with row spacing of 3.0 x 3.0 m cultivated in a 

Oxisol. We sampled three trees for each clone, considering each fertilization level and C/NI 

treatment, totaling 36 samples. 

The wood samples for chemical analyzes were collected after their reduction into 

sawdust in a Wiley laboratory mill, and subsequently classified into sieves of 40 and 60 mesh. 

The samples were air conditioned and packed in airtight containers and their moisture content 

determined. All chemical analyzes were performed in duplicate. 

After preparation of the samples, the following analyzes were performed: 

carbohydrate content (Wallis et al., 1996), uronic acids (Scott, 1979), acetyl groups (Solar et 

al., 1987), acid-insoluble lignin TAPPI T222 om-11 (Tappi, 2011a), acid-soluble lignin 

(Goldschimid, 1971), total lignin (insoluble lignin + acid-soluble lignin), lignin 

syringyl/guaiacyl (S/G) ratio (Lin and Dence, 1992), ash content TAPPI T211 om-12 (Tappi, 

2012), wood extractives TAPPI T264 cm-07 (Tappi, 2007), specific basic mass of the wood 

TAPPI T258 om-11 (Tappi, 2011b) and metal content - Ca, Mg, Mn and Fe TAPPI T266 om-

11 (Tappi, 2011c).

Experimental design 

The experiment was arranged in a completely randomized design in a 3 x 4 factorial 

outline; three fertilization levels (C/NI, T/I and F/I) and four clones, 2 of Eucalyptus grandis 

and two hybrids of Eucalyptus grandis x Eucalyptus urophylla with 3 replications, totaling 12 

treatments and 36 samples. 

   The results were analyzed by analysis of variance, upon noting the presence of 

significant interaction, the results were compared by the Tukey test at 5% level of 

significance. Statistical analyzes were performed using STATISTICA 7.0 software and the 3D 

graphs elaborated in the software MATLAB R2011b. 

 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

The effect of fertilization on the four clones studied at 72 months of age was evaluated 

based on the specific basic mass and chemical composition of wood (glucans, xylans,

Wood polysaccharides 

The glycans, which are the main carbohydrates present in the wood, maintained their 

levels statistically similar for all evaluated treatments (Table 2), as in Jian Ju et al. (1998) 

who studied the effect of 5 fertilization treatments of Eucalyptus urophylla with 108 months 

of age, and noted that fertilization did not significantly influence the carbohydrate content. 

Similarly, Miranda and Pereira (2002) studied the quality of Eucalyptus globulus with 24, 36 

and 72 months of age, and verified no significant differences between the control and the 

treatment that received fertilization. The content of uronic acids and xylan in the wood also 

showed no significant differences between treatments. In the case of acetyl groups, side 

chains of the hemicelluloses, there was no effect of ferti-irrigation, but significant difference

was observed between the clones, showing that there is influence of the genetic material on 

the content of acetyl groups. Among the clones tested, clone A of Eucalyptus grandis showed 

the highest levels of acetyl groups in relation to the others. The results of acetyl groups are 

slightly below the reference range in the literature of 2.5 to 4% (Mokfienski et al., 2004), 

however, in the work done by Gomide et al. (2005) results were obtained that are consistent 

with the data presented in the present study, with mean values ranging from 2.6% to 3.1%.  

 

Lignin 

Lignin, the second largest wood quantitative constituent, had its content determined by 

summing the values of the acid soluble and insoluble fractions. There were no significant 

differences among treatments for total lignin content (Table 2). The results of this study are 

consistent with Miranda and Pereira (2002), Jian Ju et al. (1998), and Andrade et al. (1994) 

who studied the effect of fertilizer on Eucalyptus spp. observed no influence on the total 

lignin content.  

 

S/G Ratio 

From a structural standpoint, lignins can be divided into two main classes, namely: 

guaiacyl lignin (predominant in softwoods) and syringyl/guaiacyl lignin (prevalent in 

hardwoods).  

The S/G ratio is the amount of units derived from sinapyl alcohol (syringyl monomers) 

in reference to the content of coniferyl alcohol (guaiacyl monomers) of the lignin (Sixta, 

2006). The syringyl lignin structure is more reactive, so it is believed that wood with a high 

S/G ratio are easier to delignify. 

In this work, there was a statistically significant differences among clones for the 

lignin S/G ratio (Table 2), indicating no influence of the genetic material. In the work of 

Magaton et al. (2006) a mean value of 2.0 for the S/G ratio in Eucalyptus grandis x 

Eucalyptus urophylla was found. The Eucalyptus grandis clone B showed the lowest S/G 

values, which is unfavorable for the process of wood conversion into cellulose, because it 

hinders the wood delignification process, since the lignin is more condensed (Gomes, 2008). 

 The ferti-irrigation had no effect on the treatments for the lignin S/G ratio from a 

statistical point of view. However, numerically, the Ferti-irrigation treatment showed higher 

values than the Control non-irrigated treatment.

Ash 

The principal mineral components of wood are Ca, K and Mg, Ca being the element in 

larger amounts, representing up to 50%, followed by K, Mg, Mn, N and P, respectively, 

among others (Cutter and Murphy, 1978). 

Some forest species have, as reserve material, oxalate, phosphate and silicate crystals, 

and others, in their makeup, forming bonds with the carboxylic acids of the chemical 

components of the cell wall. These crystals are often present in parenchyma cells occupying 

the lumen as reserve material (Sjöström, 1993). The shape and the amount of these crystals 

will depend on genetic and environmental factors.  

In Eucalyptus species, these crystalline formations are rare, however, in these forest 

species oxalates formations, especially calcium, may be a result of various factors, including 

mineral deficiency. In soils with high acidity, high rainfall, low amount of available nutrients 

and cation leaching, the plant resorts to storing this mineral, in order to maintain its normal 

development during seasonal growth periods (Gonzales et al., 2009; Cumming et al. 2001). 

For species assessed in this study, the ash content was not significantly different for all 

treatments (Table 2). The ash contents were found in the range of 0.1 to 1.0% based on dry 

wood, these values being in agreement with those found by other authors, such as Oliveira et 

al. (2012), Neves et al. (2011). 

 

Extractives  

The wood extractives, that comprise a large number of components, which, unlike 

most of the lignin and polysaccharides, can be extracted by means of organic solvents, 

showed statistically significant for all clones (Table 2). The results indicate that there is 

significant influence of the genetic material, but there was no effect of ferti-irrigation on the 

content of extractives for the clones, as in Miranda and Pereira (2002), who also observed in 

their studies no effect of fertilization on the content of extractives. 

 

Metal Content 

The highest amount of minerals was found in the bark, which may amount to more 

than 10 times the amount present in the wood. Among the minerals occurring in greater 

quantities we can cite calcium, potassium and magnesium, followed respectively by Mn, Na, 

Cl and P (Andrade, 2011). 



 

11 

 

Regarding the metal content for the four clones in this study, Ca, Mg, and Fe content 

showed no statistical difference. Only for the element Mn were statistical differences 

observed between the clones, a fact that shows the influence of the genetic material, as shown 

in Table 3. There was a trend of increasing Mn content in the Ferti-irrigation treatments 

compared to the non-irrigated control. This is an undesirable result because transition metals 

can cause encrustation, besides catalyzing the decomposition of peroxides during the cellulose 

production process. The decomposition of peroxide leads to the production of free radicals 

such as hydroxyl and hydroperoxide that degrade the carbohydrate chains, lowering the 

viscosity of the cellulose (Colodette et al., 1993; Thakore et al., 2005). 

 

Interaction of metal contents versus specific basic mass 

Generally woods of Eucalyptus species have low metal content, but if we analyze the 

wood of younger individuals aged close to two years, we will see that there is a higher metal 

content, this fact can be related to a more accelerated plant growth due to a greater absorption 

of nutrients from the soil, caused by higher cell metabolism during this development phase. 

Associated with nutrient availability, irrigation influences the mobility of nutrients in the soil, 

favoring their absorption by the plant. 

Trees older than two years may also exhibit greater amount of mineral elements in the 

wood constitution, this fact can be related to fertilization techniques, for example, the use of 

intensive soil fertilization associated to irrigation, which may result in faster growth and a 

possible reduction in its specific basic mass . 

Among the minerals absorbed by most plants we can cite manganese, magnesium, iron 

and calcium. 

The main form of manganese absorption by plants is as Mn2+, being absorbed by the 

roots and translocated through the xylem, along with other mineral elements dissolved in the 

sap. In tropical acid soils its availability is higher, and this characteristic decreases with 

increasing pH of the soil (Bertolazi et al., 2010).   

Figure 1 shows the relationship between specific basic mass and concentration of 

manganese (Mn) and magnesium (Mg), where the clones for C/NI treatment, which are 

devoid of fertilization and irrigation, are represented.

Figure 1. Graph of the relation between the values of specific mass (kg/m3), manganese 

concentration (mg/kg) and magnesium (mg/kg) in the wood of two tested species, for the 

C/NI treatment. 
 

In Figure 1, we see that as the specific basic mass  of the clone in the C/NI treatments 

increases, we note  the Mn increases and the Mg decreases. This fact may be related to a 

possible competition between the elements Mn and Mg, the first of which inhibits the 

absorption of certain nutrients by plants, including the Mg (Correia and Durigan, 2009; 

Mukhopadhyay and Sharma, 1991). 

Figure 2 graphically shows the values for the relationship between the specific basic 

mass and concentration of manganese (Mn) and magnesium (Mg) in the wood of ther 4 clones 

of the F/I treatment.  

 

Figure 2. Graph of the relation between specific mass values (kg/m3), manganese 

concentration (mg/kg) and  magnesium (mg/kg)  in the wood of two tested species, for the F/I 

treatment. 

 

In Figure 2 it can be seen that there was a decrease in the specific basic mass of the 

element associated with an increase of Mn and a decrease of Mg. The trees with more growth 

tend to have a lower specific basic mass  associated to greater absorption of nutrients.  Mn, as 

it is an element with lower mobility in the plant, tends to be absorbed in higher quantities and 



 

13 

 

accumulate in certain parts of the wood, consequently also causing a reduction in the 

absorption of magnesium, since they compete (Bertolazi et al., 2010; Correia and Durigan, 

2009; Mukhopadhyay and Sharma, 1991). According Bertolazi et al. (2010) one of the ways 

to increase the availability of manganese in the soil is associated with fertilizer application. 

Figure 3 graphically presents the values for the relationship between the specific basic 

mass and the concentration of iron (Fe) and calcium (Ca) in the wood of the 4 clones of the 

C/NI treatment. 

 

Figure 3. Graph of the relation between the specific mass (kg/m3), concentration of Fe 

(mg/kg) and Ca (mg/kg) in the wood of two tested species, for the C/NI treatment. 

 

Analyzing Figure 3, it can be seen that there was an increase in specific basic mass  

accompanied by an increase in the amount of iron, and a reduction of the amount of calcium, 

considering the values for the two species. 

The soils of origin of the species studied was the oxisol, which has a low pH, 

combined with a high amount of aluminum, which increases its toxicity to plants. Calcium 

absorption by trees in soils with low nutrient availability, in addition to low pH, favors its 

storage by the plant, as a reserve nutrient, so that it can complete its development during 

inhospitable times (Gonzales et al., 2009) . 

One possible explanation for the high iron content is in the content of manganese. 

Woods with high density, present lower amounts of manganese in relation to the low specific 

basic mass , the Mn being a competitor of the Fe 

In Figure 4 graphically showns the values for the relationship between the density and 

the concentration of iron (Fe) and calcium (Ca) in the wood of the 4 clones of the F/I 

treatment.

Figure 4. Graph of the relation between specific mass values (kg/m3), concentration of Fe 

(mg/Kg) and Ca (mg/Kg) in the wood of two tested species, for the F/I treatment. 

 

In the Figure 4 graph of it can be seen that with the decreasing values of specific basic 

mass, there is an increase of iron content and a reduction in the calcium content of the wood 

of the clones for both species. 

With irrigation associated to fertilization the availability and mobility of the soil 

nutrients increases, favoring their higher absorption by the plant and thus, greater 

development. Trees with rapid development, in general, show a reduction in their specific 

basic mass  and low calcium accumulation (Gonzales et al., 2009). 

It can be seen in Figure 4 that the iron content increased with decreasing specific 

basic mass , which probably can be associated with the competition of manganese with iron 

and also the occurrence of a larger amount of Fe2+ in the soil, which is soluble and can be 

absorbed by the plant in greater amounts, especially in irrigated crops (Mendonça et al., 

2005).  

Other factors, such as genetic characteristics and environmental conditions, may also 

influence the concentration of elements in different plant tissues, causing changes in nutrient 

use efficiency (Silva, 2011). 

 

Specific basic mass  

One of the most important properties of wood for cellulose production is its specific 

basic mass, because it is directly related to the specific consumption of the wood, i.e. the 

volume of wood needed to produce a given mass of cellulose. The higher the specific basic 

mass, the lower the wood consumption. This characteristic is strongly associated with the 

wood anatomy, with those less dense overall, having a higher pore diameter, which facilitates 

the penetration of the reagents during the wood chemical deconstruction process.

In Figure 5, presents the specific basic mass values for the four clones and their 

treatments.

Slashes followed by the same small letter don’t differ among themselves at 5% probability 

(Tukey, p&gt;0,05). 

 

Through the analysis of Figure 5, one can see that the means for the specific basic 

mass variable of the F/I treatments were lower in comparison with the other two treatments, 

(C/NI and T/NI). This fact can be explained by greater tree growth, when subjected to a 

stimulus caused by the increased availability of nutrients in the soil. 

The variation of the specific basic mass is not only linked to the fertilization factor, 

other factors, such as genetic variation, water and light availability, the location of the tree in 

the stand and spacing between individuals, also affect the specific basic mass . In previous 

studies, the effect of fertilization on specific basic mass was also observed, where it decreased 

with the use of fertilizer (Berger, 2000). 

Figure 5 shows that for clone A of the Eucalyptus grandis species, the variation in 

specific basic mass between treatments C/NI and F/I was 8%, and for clones A and B of the 

hybrid Eucalyptus grandis x Eucalyptus urophylla it was 11.2 and 1.3%, respectively, values 

that are close to those found in the works cited by Berger (2000). 

In Clone B of Eucalyptus grandis a decrease in the specific basic mass was not 

observed; there was an increase. This fact may be related to the type of genetic material in the 

individuals of this clone. Vital (1990) in his work, cites conflicting results, from the decrease 

to the increase of this property, caused by fertilization.

CONCLUSIONS 

Overall, the ferti-irrigation caused a reduction in the specific basic mass of the wood , 

except for the clone B of Eucalyptus grandis which had its specific basic mass increased 

because of ferti-irrigation. The syringyl/guaiacyl ratio, manganese content and acetyl group 

contents were influenced by the type of genetic material, with no effect of ferti-irrigation on 

such properties. 

The ferti-irrigation technique, showed some negative aspects regarding the quality of 

the wood of certain eucalyptus clones, it being relevant to consider the impact if this 

technique on the cellulose manufacturing production process.

CHAPTER 2 

 PRELIMINARY STUDIES ON FURFURAL PRODUCTION FROM 
LIGNOCELLULOSICS 

 

ABSTRACT 

This study focused on the production of furfural from agricultural and industrial biomass residues by 

the hydrodistillation process. Corn cobs, sugarcane bagasse and eucalypt wood were treated with 

sulfuric, hydrochloric and phosphoric acids as catalysts, with different acids concentrations (1.5 to 5.2 

mol.L-1). In addition the eucalyptus liquor from pre-hydrolysis Kraft dissolving pulp production 

process was also investigated as a source of furfural, using sulfuric and hydrochloric acids as a 

catalyst (0.9 and 3.9 mol.L-1). It was shown that furfural production is strongly influenced by the acid 

catalyst concentration, the source of mineral acid and the raw material. Furfural productivity of 30.2, 

25.8 and 13.9% were achieved for corn cob, sugarcane bagasse and eucalypt wood, respectively, on 

the basis of biomass dry weight. Conversion yield of pentose into furfural were 90.5, 83.6, 110.6% 

for corn cob, sugarcane bagasse and eucalypt wood, respectively The HCl requirements were 5.2 

mol.L-1 for both corn cob and sugarcane bagasse and 3.9 mol.L-1 for eucalypt wood. The yield of 

conversion from pentose to furfural using eucalypt liquor from the pre-hydrolysis Kraft process was 

71.5% using HCl 3.9 mol.L-1. So, it can be concluded that the use of hydro distillation process was a 
very effective method for the furfural production from lignocellulosic residues by mineral acid 

catalysis. The most attractive raw material was corn cobs which resulted in the highest furfural 

production (ex: 302 kg furfural/ dry ton of biomass), with sugarcane bagasse coming second. 

Keywords: Furfural, mineral acids, pre-hydrolysis, lignocellulosic material. 
 

INTRODUCTION 

The interest for chemical production based on renewable source has increased in the 

last decade due the declining reserves and increasing prices of fossil materials. Among the 

different types of available biomass, agricultural crops, non-woody materials, annual plants or 

grasses present a special interest due to their abundance, renewability and inexpensive source 

to obtain polymeric materials, energy or chemicals (Egüés et al., 2012a; Egüés et al., 2012b; 

Serrano et al., 2010). 

Agricultural and agro-industrial residues are mainly constituted by three structural 

components (lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose) and each compound has specific properties 

destined for different uses for chemical production. Biomass residues available from 

agricultural and forest processing constitute a potential source for chemical production such 

as ethanol, reducing sugars and furfural, using enzyme or acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. All 

pentosans containing fibrous material could in theory be used as raw material for furfural 

production; however, the furfural industrial production requires minimum pentosans content 

around 15 to 20% (Yahyazadeh, 2011). Only about one third of the pentosans in the raw 

materials can be converted into furfural by means of existing production processes. 



 

20 

 

Furfural is an important chemical because it is a selective solvent for separating 

saturated and unsaturated compounds in petroleum refining, gas, oil and diesel fuel and for 

the high demand of its derivatives, especially furfuryl alcohol, used mainly in the production 

of furan resins for foundry sand binders, which is consider the major market for furfural 

(Vázquez et al., 2007). So far, there is no synthetic route available for furfural production in 

the chemical industry, consequently it is exclusively produced by acid hydrolysis and 

dehydration of pentoses (mainly xylose) contained in lignocellulosic biomass (like corn cobs, 

cotton stalk, sunflower stalk, sugarcane bagasse, etc.) (Riansa-ngawong and Prasertsan, 2011; 

Vázquez et al., 2007; Yemi? and Mazza, 2011). 

There are two main types of technologies to produce furfural. First one it is an one-

stage technology, when the pentosans depolymerization in xylose and dehydration to furfural 

occur simultaneously (Perego and Bianchi, 2010; Serrano et al., 2010). The second one is the 

two-stage technology, when the dissolution and depolymerization of pentosans occur under 

mild conditions, followed by dehydration of xylose to furfural (Sánchez et al., 2013). The 

advantage of the two-stage technology is that the residual lignocellulose is less degraded and 

can be used for conversion to other chemicals (glucose, ethanol, phenols, etc.) in a subsequent 

step. The scheme of reactions for furfural production is given in Figure 1 (Ribeiro et al., 

2012).

Several researchers investigated the production of furfural by hydrolysis of 

lignocellulosic residue materials in the presence of mineral acid as catalyst, such as 

hydrochloric acid - HCl (Herrera et al., 2004; Lavarack et al., 2002; Yemi? and Mazza, 2012), 



 

21 

 

nitric acid - HNO3 (Rodr??guez-Chong et al., 2004), sulfuric acid - H2SO4 (Bamufleh et al., 

2013; Riansa-ngawong and Prasertsan, 2011; Yat et al., 2008) and phosphoric acid - H3PO4 

(Gámez et al., 2006; Lenihan et al., 2010; Vázquez et al., 2007). Raw materials used to 

furfural production reported in the literature included sugarcane bagasse (Gámez et al., 2006; 

Rodr??guez-Chong et al., 2004), timber (Yat et al., 2008), date-palm trees (Bamufleh et al., 

2013), sorghum straw (Herrera et al., 2004; Vázquez et al., 2007), eucalypt (García-

Domínguez et al., 2013), corn cobs (Garrote et al., 2007; Sánchez et al., 2013), rice hull 

(Mansilla et al., 1998) and rice straw (Amiri et al., 2010).  

Currently, many studies have been developed for using lignocellulosic materials as 

feedstock for chemicals production, such as furfural, for example (Sánchez et al., 2013; Liu et 

al., 2013). In this context, are applied the biorefinery concept, which use pretreatments for an 

organized deconstruction of the biomass aiming bioproducts and chemicals production. 

Among the pre-treatments for lignocellulosic biomass, the pre-hydrolysis treatment recovers 

high quantities of hemicelluloses, converting them into soluble saccharides, while both 

cellulose and lignin are largely retained in the solid phase (Liu et al., 2010). The solid fraction 

obtained from the pre-hydrolysis treatments can be used for bioethanol production or some 

biobased added-value products (Batalha et al., 2012; Behin and Zeyghami, 2009).  The liquid 

hemicellulose-rich stream, can be used as raw material for furfural, hydroxymethylfurfural 

and alcohol production and to extract phenols from the dissolved lignin fractions (Garrote et 

al., 2006; Carvalheiro et al., 2008; Alvarado-Morales et al., 2009; Garrote et al., 2004).  

The aim of this study was investigating furfural production from corn cob, sugarcane 

bagasse and eucalypt wood using different concentrations of mineral acids (hydrochloric, 

sulfuric and phosphoric acids) through the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. In addition, the 

eucalypt liquor from the pre-hydrolysis Kraft process was investigated for furfural production, 

using hydrochloric and sulfuric acid as catalysts. 

 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Materials 

Corn cob (CC) and sugarcane bagasse (SCB) harvested at Federal University of 

Viçosa, a Brazilian experimental station, and also, the Eucalyptus urophylla x Eucalyptus 

grandis chips (EUCA) supplied by a Brazilian forest company were used in this study. The 

raw materials were dried at room temperature and grinded in a laboratory mill, then sieved 

and classified according to T257 cm-12 standard procedure (Tappi, 2012a). All samples were 



 

22 

 

extracted with ethanol/toluene 1:2, ethanol 95% and hot water and subjected to moisture 

determination in accordance with T264 cm-07 (Tappi, 2007).  

 

Quantitative Chemical Characterization 

The carbohydrate composition of raw materials was determined by High Performance 

Anion Exchange Chromatography with Pulse Amperometric Detection (HPAEC-PAD) after 

pre-treatment (30°C, 1 h) of the materials with aqueous 72% H2SO4 followed by hydrolysis 

with 3% H2SO4 in an autoclave (100°C, 3 h). HPAEC-PAD was carried out in a Dionex ICS-

3000 system equipped with a CarboPac PA1 (250 x 4mm) analytical column. The 

monosaccharides were separated isocratically with 0.001 M NaOH (45 min, flowrate 1 

mL/min) according to (Wallis et al., 1996). The solid residue after hydrolysis was considered 

as Klason lignin according to T222 cm-11 standard procedure (Tappi, 2011). Ashes were 

determined by calcination according to TAPPI standard T211 om-12 (Tappi, 2012b). Acid 

soluble lignin was determined by measuring the UV-absorbance of the filtrate at 205 nm 

according (Goldschimid, 1971). Total uronic acids in raw materials hydrolysates were 

measured by the colorimetric method involving 3,5-dimethylphenol addition according to 

Scott (1979). The acetyl group content in samples wood was determined according to Solar et 

al. (1987). All results were calculated from two replicate determinations. 

 

Pre-hydrolysis (PH) 

The pre-hydrolysis treatment for EUCA chips was carried out in 7 liter M/K digester 

equipped with a heat exchanger, circulating pump, and computer-controlled time and 

temperature, under the following fixed conditions: 1000 g oven-dry (OD) of chips, 4/1 (m3/t) 

liquid/material ratio, 170°C maximum temperature, 90 minutes to maximum temperature, 15 

minutes at maximum temperature, and 2.5 to 3.0 final pH. 

 

Hydro distillation  

Furfural production in the two-stage process was carried out initially with a pre-

hydrolysis of 1 g OD sample in a boiling flask with 100 mL of mineral acids at different 

concentration and reflux times (time was recorded immediately after initiation of boiling). 

The flask was connected to the simple distillation apparatus, so it was added 300 mL of 

mineral acids into separatory funnel, previously assembled as in T223 cm-10 (Tappi, 2010). 

During the boiling time, furfural was recovered by steam distillation. In the next step, the 



 

23 

 

hydrolysate was heated and the distillate was collected in a 500 mL erlenmeyer flask 

immersed in an ice bath. For each 30 mL of hydrolysate obtained in the distillation, it was 

added 30 mL acid until reached 300 mL of hydrolysate. Results were calculated from two 

replicate determinations. 

 

Furfural production  

The raw materials (CC, SBC and EUCA) were used for furfural production by hydro 

distillation, while the hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and phosphoric acid 

(H3PO4) were used as catalysts to improve the reaction. The experimental parameters of the 

acid catalysts concentrations used, for each raw material was following concentrations: 1.5; 

2.3; 2.6; 3.0; 3.9 and 5.2 mol.L-1. 

From the hemicelluloses present in the EUCA pre-hydrolysate, furfural was obtained 

by two different experimental designs. In the experimental design with H2SO4 the following 

conditions were used: temperature 170°C, 0.9 mol.L-1, 3 hours reaction time and 3/1 

liquid/solid ratio (Mamman et al., 2008). The experimental design with HCl (3.9 mol.L-1) 

used to determine the maximum production of furfural was by hydro distillation 

transformations of pentoses into furfural. 

 

Furfural quantification 

Furfural was determined using a spectrophotometric method developed by Nascimento 

et al. (1998). The analysis is based on the reaction of furfural with aniline in acetic acid and 

ethanol 95% to stabilize the colour. The test was conducted in the dark and under stirring for 

15 minutes. Spectral analyses were done at 510 nm (Varian Cary 50 Probe UV-visible, 

U.S.A.) and compared with a calibration curve for pure furfural, and the furfural productivity 

was calculated by according to Equation 1:

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Chemical composition of raw materials 

The chemical compositions of CC, SCB and EUCA (percentage on oven-dry weight 

basis) are showed in Table 1, based on two replicate determinations. The raw materials are 

defined by their content of glucose, xylose, arabinose, galactose, mannose, acetyl groups, 

lignin, ash and uronic acid. Due to the presence of ash, acid insoluble lignin analysis gave an 

overestimation to lignin content; therefore, the lignin values were corrected by their ash 

content (Anglés et al., 1997).

Also, the data showed that the pentose content (xylose + arabinose) were 33.4% for 

CC, 30.8% for SCB and 12.6% for EUCA, which constitute an adequate content comparable 

to that found in wheat hulls, cotton seeds, and nut shells commonly used for furfural 

production. Because of the current importance of lignin as a raw material for the production 

of bioproducts and biofuels (Buranov and Mazza, 2008), samples were also analyzed for their 

acid insoluble lignin and acid soluble lignin.  

The chemical composition of CC showed that total lignin was 17.8%, while their 

uronic acid and ash contents were 2.2% and 1.2%, respectively. In relation to glucose content 

(47.1%), the experimental result was higher than reported by other authors (Van Dongen et 

al., 2011; Lili et al., 2011; Garrote et al., 2007), fact which can be explained by the method 

used by each author for quantification of carbohydrates. Values of xylose, 28.0%; arabinose, 

5.4%; mannose, 0.2%; and acetyl groups, 2.9%; for samples determined in this study are 

closely comparable to those reported by them (Van Dongen et al., 2011; Garrote et al., 2007) 

for similar samples. 

The structural carbohydrates (glucose and xylose) which are the major substrates for 

furan production, accounted for approximately 74.6% of the SCB (Table 1). These values are 

in the range found by other workers for this kind of materials (Alves et al., 2010; Canilha et 

al., 2007; Hamzeh et al., 2013). It is well known that pentoses and hexoses, respectively, are 



 

26 

 

the precursors for furfural and HMF formed during the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass 

(Yemis and Mazza, 2011). Determination of the initial quantity of the main constituents 

available in biomass allowed for the calculation of the yields and theoretical conversion rates 

of furfural from raw material for calculation of efficiency of furfural production.  

The chemical composition of the Eucalyptus urophylla x Eucalyptus grandis hybrid 

was similar to reported for  other eucalyptus  reported by other authors (Batalha et al., 2012; 

Alves et al., 2010), except in relation to glucose content (53.1%) as showed in Table 1. 

However, glucose values similar to the one observed in this work has been previously 

reported (Mokfienski et al., 2008). 

 

Pre-hydrolysis  

The pre-hydrolysis (PH) has the advantage or removing significant amounts of xylans. 

In comparison to acid hydrolysis, autohydrolysis generates lower quantities of   byproduct, 

minimizes equipment corrosion, and decrease operational costs. The eucalypt xylan content 

decreased 48.9%, from 12.3% in the original material to 7.1% in the PH chips. The yield loss 

in the pre-hydrolysis treatment was 11.4%, (Table 2). According to a literature, the liquor 

derived from the PH treatment contains a mixture of sugar oligomers mostly xylo-

oligosaccharides (XOS), monosaccharides (xylose and arabinose), acetic acid (from acetyl 

groups) and sugar decomposition products. Moreover, it was found that the formation rate of 

these compounds depends on the autohydrolysis conditions, e.g. temperature and reaction 

time, in agreement with previous reports (Pu et al., 2011; Garrote et al., 1999).

Furfural production 

Sulfuric, hydrochloric and phosphoric acids are widely used as catalysts in industrial 

furfural production. The results of Figure 2 indicate the productivities of the furfural 

production with different acids for CC, SCB and CC. The furfural productivity increases with 

increasing acid concentration regardless of raw material and acid type. The highest furfural 

productivities were achieved with HCl as catalyst. Based on the biomass dry weight, 

productivities of 30.2, 25.8 and 13.9% were obtained for CC, SCB and EUCA, respectively.

This productivity was achieved with 5.2 mol.L-1 HCl for CC and SCB and 3.9 mol.L-1 HCl for 

EUCA. When H2SO4 was used as catalyst, the maximum productivities attained were 27.3, 

21.0 and 11.4% for CC, SCB and EUCA, respectively, under the same acid molar 

concentrations previously reported for HCl. In the case of H3PO4, the highest furfural 

productivities were 26.0, 18.2, 7.6 for CC, SCB and EUCA, respectively, under the same acid 

molar concentrations previously reported for HCl. 

Yemis and Mazza (2010) reported an increase in furfural productivity from xylose 

from 9.3 to 36.1 g/100 g when the HCl concentration increased from 0.01 to 0.1 mol.L-1. 

Recently, Rong et al. (2012) reported that the furfural productivity was higher in high 

concentration of H2SO4 systems compared to that in low concentration and the highest 

furfural conversion efficiency (75%) was achieved with 10% (w/w) H2SO4, but the 

conversion efficiency decreased to 51% when the concentration of H2SO4 was raised to 

12.5% (w/w). 

The fact that the highest furfural productivity obtained in this study was with HCl can 

be explained by the greater availability of H+ ions in HCl solutions compared to phosphoric 

and sulfuric acid solutions at a given molar concentration. Similar results have been reported 

by (Yemi? and Mazza, 2011) comparing the effect of four strong mineral acids (hydrochloric, 

sulfuric, nitric, and phosphoric acids) and two organic acids - acetic (CH3COOH) and formic 

acids (HCOOH) on furfural yield. The furfural productivities obtained from xylose in the 

presence of HCl, H2SO4, HNO3 (nitric acid), H3PO4, CH3COOH and HCOOH were 37.5%, 

31.9%, 3.5%, 27.6%, 15.8%, and 23.8% at pH 1.12, respectively.

The gradual decrease in furfural concentration beyond the maximum value achieved 

indicates that beyond certain achieved furfural concentration the rate of furfural loss to 

decomposition products becomes higher than the rate of furfural production. Moreover, the 

nature of the solvent chosen and the biomass type were the major factors influencing 

conversion of pentose to furfural. So, the furfural conversion yield is an important parameter, 

for each raw material used in this study, in order to know the rate of pentose conversion into 

furfural. The results for furfural conversion yield are shown in Figure 3. 

 

 

Figure 3. Furfural conversion yield on the basis of CC, SCB, and EUCA pentose contents for 

various mineral acid catalysts concentrations. 

 

According to Figure 3, the furfural conversion yield was higher for EUCA in relation 

to CC and SCB, when HCl and H2SO4 were used as catalysts. The highest furfural conversion 

yield was found when HCl was used as catalyst reaching 90.5% for CC (5.2 mol.L-1) 83.6% 

for SCB (5.2 mol.L-1) and 110.6% for EUCA (3.9 mol.L-1). The highest furfural conversion 

yields for H2SO4 were 81.6 (5.2 mol.L
-1), 68.1 (5.2 mol.L-1) and 90.6 (3.0 mol.L-1) for CC, 

SCB and EUCA, respectively. Finally, the highest conversion yields for H3PO4 were 77.8 (5.2 

mol.L-1), 59.2 (5.2 mol.L-1) and 60.6% (3.9 mol.L-1) for CC, SCB and EUCA, respectively. 

These results indicate that the initial pentose concentration is a very important parameter for 

furfural conversion yield. Yang et al. (2012) reported that furfural conversion yield decreased 

from 70 to 60% when the xylose concentration increased from 40 to 120 g/L. It could be 

concluded that furfural conversion yield decreases with increasing pentose concentration.  

This fact may be explained considering that furfural formation is followed by side 

reactions, such as resinification of the furfural formed, condensation of furfural with pentose-

to-furfural intermediates and fragmentation of pentose, all of which decrease the furfural 



 

29 

 

conversion yield. According to Dunlop (1951), the initial pentose concentration greatly affects 

the maximum obtainable furfural conversion yield in an aqueous solution. The dilute pentose 

concentrations helps reducing the undesirable side reactions between furfural and its 

precursors, such as the resinification of the furfural produced (Figure 4), condensation of the 

furfural with pentose-to-furfural intermediates. 

 

Figure 4. Reaction resinification of the furfural. 

 

However, in commercial processes, low initial pentose concentrations are undesirable 

since they require larger reactors and more heat to produce the furfural. So, for economical 

reasons, initial pentose concentration should not be too low. The optimal initial pentose 

concentration is also decided by furfural yield, operating costs, and the pentose concentration 

in the hydrolysate.  

A low initial concentration of pentoses showed high furfural conversion yield, 

however the overall cost per gallon of furfural produced is a much better criterion for a 

process design than the achievement of high furfural productivities. 

The mass balance of total furfural production is shown in Figure 5. Among the raw 

materials, CC was one with high furfural productivity in relation of SCB and EUCA, but 

EUCA was one with higher furfural conversion yield than the others raw materials used in 

this study. Overall, the best raw material for furfural production was corn cobs, and HCl was 

the best catalyst.

Furfural production from EUCA pre-hydrolysis liquor 

The highest furfural concentration obtained from EUCA pre-hydrolysis liquor using 

3.9 mol.L-1 of HCl as catalyst, by hydro distillation, was 9.3 g/L. This furfural concentration 

corresponds to a furfural productivity of 8.8% and conversion yield of 71.5% respect to total 

pentoses present in the EUCA liquor PH. A 9.2 g/L of furfural concentration was obtained 

using 0.9 mol.L-1 H2SO4 as catalyst for 3 hours at 170° C; this concentration corresponds to a 

furfural productivity of 8.8%, conversion yield of 70.8% respect to pentoses in the EUCA 

liquor PH.  

From the xylans obtained from EUCA pre-hydrolysis high concentration of furfural 

can be produced. It is a way of consuming renewable agro-industrial residues of dissolving 

pulp production. From 1 Ton of dissolving pulp, it is possible to produce 100 kg of furfural, 

consuming 1537 kg of HCl. The process must be improved giving its poor economics. 

Furfural production from CC, SCB, EUCA, and EUCA liquor PH (liquors rich in 

xylans) can be achieved using high concentration mineral acid catalyst. Thus, it is relevant to 

considerer the amount of acid spent in the processes (g produced furfural/g spent acid).  A 

summary of optimum conditions for furfural production on the basis of the results of this 

study are show in Table 3.

CONCLUSIONS 

The maximum productivity and furfural yield were found when HCl was used as 

catalyst in the hydro distillation process, in relation to H2SO4 and H3PO4.

The most attractive raw material was corn cobs which resulted in the highest furfural 

production (ex: 302 kg furfural/ dry ton of biomass), with sugarcane bagasse coming second. 

Furfural productivity increased with increasing raw material pentosan content, but 

furfural conversion yield from pentose increased with decreasing pentose concentration. 

The eucalyptus liquor from pre-hydrolysis Kraft dissolving pulp production, proved to 

be technically feasible for the furfural production, the process must be improved giving its 

poor economics.

 OVERALL CONCLUSIONS 

 

In the first part of this study that evaluated the effect of ferti-irrigation on the quality 

of eucalyptus wood it was concluded that the ferti-irrigation caused a reduction in the wood 

specific basic mass, except for the clone B of Eucalyptus grandis, in which its specific basic 

mass increased. The syringyl/guaiacyl ratio, manganese content and acetyl group content were 

influenced by the type of genetic material, with no effect of ferti-irrigation on such properties. 

The ferti-irrigation technique decreased the specific basic mass of certain eucalyptus 

clones, making it relevant to consider the negative aspects regarding the quality of the wood, 

in the cellulose manufacturing production process. 

In the second part of this paper we present a preliminary study on the production of 

furfural from different lignocellulosic materials. We concluded that the maximum 

performance, productivity and yield of furfural were found when HCl was used as a catalyst 

in the steam distillation process compared to H2SO4 and H3PO4. The raw material with the 

highest furfural production was the corn cob, sugarcane bagasse being second best. The 

furfural productivity was directly proportional to the pentoses content in the raw material, but 

the yield proceeded inversely, increasing with the decreasing concentrations of pentoses. 

The eucalyptus liquor from pre-hydrolysis Kraft dissolving pulp production, proved to 

be technically feasible for the production of furfural, but should be improved so that it 

becomes economically viable.
