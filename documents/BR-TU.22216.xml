Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 

Prologue 

During the last decade a large effort has been developed by the scientific community to 
map, study and understand tectonic and magmatic processes taking place in the Azores 
Triple Junction Area. The move between small and localized observations centred on a 
few Islands to a general plan to study the whole triple junction area required a multitude 
of means, a multidisciplinary approach and a significant level of logistics. 

One piece of the global effort was organized in Portugal through the research project 
STAMINA. Even if the two cruises planned in the scoope of this project, were never 
completed, it gathered a variety of geophysical, geochemical, geodetic and tectonic 
teams that organized their effort in the same scientific problem. It also allowed the 
means to coordinate the national participation in a series of research operations led by 
the international community where we had the opportunity to act as active partners and 
benefit from their much better technical means.  

In what concerns this work, those cruise limitations were important in the amount of 
new swath bathymetry data acquired (6.5 hours of high quality EM300 swath 
bathymetry data collected as piggy back to the main SIRENA I cruise; PI J. Jean 
Goslin); several hours more of magnetic data collected over the Serreta eruption site 
west of Terceira Island again marginally to the SIRENA II cruise. Such a data scarcity 
led to the broadening of the thesis objectives thematically although centred in the 
Azores, still the core of this work. The scientific objectives remained under the umbrella 
of “the volcano-tectonic interactions” but with a broader spatial and temporal scale to 
allow integration of other research topics 

To improve efficiency of research and overcome data availability limitations, we 
developed a set of collaborations with foreign partners in complementary lines of 
research, (Peter Cobbold; Jean Goslin) and a stronger focus on the cooperation with the 
remaining STAMINA colleagues: Fernando Ornelas Marques (Tectonics, University of 
Lisbon); Rui Fernandes (Geodesy, University of  Beira Interior), João Catalão 
(Geodesy, University of Lisbon), All these collaborations resulted in a number of 
publications, currently in preparation, submitted or already published. The current 
manuscript is constructed with a large amount of this material collated into a single 
volume. Some original texts have been enhanced whereas others have been edited, 
reduced or focused on specific topics related with the manuscript theme.

TÍTULO DA TESE:  Processos tectono-magmáticos na Junção Tripla dos Açores 

 

Resumo 

Apresentam-se resultados de estudos multi-disciplinares, centrados na interacção 
espacio-temporal entre o Ponto Quente dos Açores (PQA) e a Junção Tripla dos Açores 
(JTA) no decurso da evolução geodinâmica da plataforma vulcânica dos Açores e 
sintetiza-se um modelo tectono-magmático para a JTA na actualidade. 

Desde os 33.4 Ma o regime tectónico prevalecente é trans-tractivo com rotação 
progressiva das direcções de abertura Eurásia-Africa de ca. N-S para ca. ENE-WSW. 
Desde aquela idade os Açores apresentam um comportamento cinemático independente 
e possivelmente dominado por deformação distribuída.  

A máxima interacção entre o PQA e a JTA ocorre entre os 20 Ma e os 10 Ma. 
Consequentemente entre os 33.4 e os 20Ma os Açores terão resultado de um controlo 
tectónico proeminente e reduzida influência do PQA. 

O desenvolvimento das cristas vulcânicas lineares (CVL) é associado à progressiva 
migração para NW do JTA de um contexto intra-transformante desde os ca. 15 Ma. No 
presente considera-se que persiste a propagação das CVL para WNW. 

A modelação de dados GPS, permite definir na actualidade a fronteira de placas Euro-
asiatica e Núbia no Eixo da Terceira e no alinhamento Faial-Pico. Propõe-se que a zona 
inter-placa entre estes dois eixos principais activos corresponde a um domínio de 
deformação distribuída não coaxial em regime de trans-tracção. Nesta zona ocorre  
partição entre processos de rifting (dominados por magmatismo) em tracção pura 
normal às CVL, processos de cisalhamento com desligamentos esquerdos (NNW-SSE) 
e zonas de acomodação (WSW-ENE). Contrastando, o padrão de falhamento no sector 
imediatamente a Leste da ilha Terceira, é interpretado como resultado de um regime de 
alastramento oblíquo focalizado no eixo da terceira, com deformação co-axial, e um 
campo de tensões com compressão máxima vertical e compressão mínima sub-paralela 
às direcções de abertura previstas pelos modelos cinemáticos NUVEL-1A ou baseados 
em GPS (e.g. REVEL ou DEOS2K).

Tectono-magmatic processes in the Azores Triple Junction 
 
 

Abstract 

Multi-disciplinary results on the spatio-temporal interaction between the Azores hot-
spot (AHS) and the Azores Triple Junction (ATJ) during the Azores plateau evolution, 
are presented. In addition a tectono-magmatic model of the ATJ for the present day is 
summarized. 

Since 33.4 Ma, the dominant tectonic regime is transtensional with progressive rotation 
of the Eurasia-Africa opening directions from ca. N-S to ca. ENE-WSW. Since that 
early age, the Azores present a kinematic behavior which is independent from that of 
the larger plates and possibly dominated by distributed deformation.  

The maximum interaction between the AHS and the ATJ occurs between the 20 and 10 
Ma. Consequently, between 33.4 and 20 Ma the evolution of the Azores has been 
prominently a result of tectonic controls and had little influence of the AHS. 

The growth of the linear volcanic ridges (LVR) is interpreted as the result of the 
progressive migration of the ATJ, since ca. 15 Ma, from an intra-transform context, 
towards NW. Their propagation subsists in the present day, now towards WNW. 

The modeling of GPS data has allowed to constrain in the present day, the Eurasia-
Nubia plate boundary along the Terceira axis and in the Pico-Faial alignment. It is 
suggested that the inter-plate zone adjoining this two active axis, corresponds to a 
domain of non-coaxial distributed deformation dominated by transtension. In this zone 
there is a partition between rifting processes (dominated by magmatism)  in pure 
tension, normal to the LVR axis, and shear processes characterized by left lateral strike 
slips (along NNW-SSE) and relay zones (along WSW-ENE). Contrastingly, the faulting 
pattern, east of Terceira Island suggests prevalence of co-axial oblique extension, 
focalized within the Terceira axis, and a stress field with maximum compressive axis 
vertical, and minimum compressive axis sub-parallel to the opening directions predicted 
by NUVEL-1A or GPS based (e.g REVEL, DEOS2K) kinematic models.

Acknowledgments 

 

Miguel Miranda was my compellingly enthusiastic supervisor and PI of STAMINA, 
under which most of the recent data sets used in this PhD project, were acquired. 
Miguel has always stroke me with his capacity of finding some shed of bright light in a 
sometimes all black scenario, for example, when all the cruises scheduled for the 
Azores “sank”. I acknowledge him, the countless discussions we had about different 
Azores and other topics, his critical review of this manuscript, and above all for making 
me face new challenges and pushing me forward in what concerns scientific research. 
STAMINA project from FCT sponsored all the Azores field work and my visits to 
Rennes University. 

António Ribeiro was my co-supervisor on this thesis from the beginning. I thank him 
the thoughtful review of this manuscript and his sharing of views and opinions both in 
the field when discussing Terceira Island tectonics in the Azores and at the office, in a 
great variety of issues His constant availability during this work is greatly appreciated 
by me. 

The work with Fernando Ornelas Marques, within STAMINA project, particularly 
during several field campaigns in the Azores for tectonic mapping and field 
observations, gave me the opportunity to have new insights in the analysis of geological 
processes. I am also indebt to Fernando for his availability and for introducing me to 
analogue modelling techniques. Although some of the work of this manuscript is the 
direct result of this collaboration, it does not make justice to the overall benefices of my 
learning process from Fernando. 

I thank Joaquim Luís, for continuously providing me copies of his software, which I 
used intensively during the course of this work. Additionally, Joaquim has always been 
a source of fruitful discussions on the many different questions regarding the Azores 
and Geophysics. 

João Alveirinho Dias, was my coordinator at the University Algarve and gave me the 
opportunity to realize this extensive research program. These acknowledgments are 
extensible to my collegues in the Algarve University: Oscar Ferreira, Ana Barbosa, 
Cristina Pires, Delminda Moura and Tomasz Boski, for their friendship and support.

Acknoledgments 
 

 
During this work time span I had the privilege to meet Jean Goslin, a skilled senior 
researcher from UBO (Université de Bretagne Occidental) which became a very good 
friend. With Jean Goslin, we sailed two missions (SIRENA I and II). The SIRENA I 
with heavy roll and pitch during most of the sailing will never be forgotten. 

I benefited also from a 3 month scholarship sponsored by IFREMER-ICCTI protocol in 
the framework of French-Portuguese bilateral agreements, which enabled me to 
participate in the SIRENA data processing and analysis at IUEM – Brest, along with Dr. 
Robert Dziak from NOAA, which provided numerous and valuable insights on the 
strategy for the data processing and analysis.  This stay was the natural prolongation of 
the good time spent at sea. I am indebt to Jean Goslin and his family, Julie Perrot, 
Christophe Martin, J. Y. Royer from the SIRENA team and remaining staff of IUEM 
with whom I contacted during my stay, for this profitable and enjoyable visit.  “Merci a 
tous pour votre super accueil à Brest”. 

I thank Peter Cobbold for sharing with me new ideas on the role of fluids in deformation 
and for the level of exigence and rigor he imposes in the research work. This led to the 
improvement in the quality of my own work. I acknowledge also the help of my 
colleagues particularly: Nuno Rodrigues, Regis Morgues, J J Kemarrec and Xavier Le 
Fort during my stay in Geoscience Rennes in the Analogue modeling lab. 

I thank the researchers of CGUL with whom I worked for a long time: Maria Ana 
Baptista, Luis Matias, Fernando Santos and Pedro Soares. Pedro Silva has been my 
close “compagnon de route” for most of this work and helped forming a united front to 
survive Miguel’s barbarian provocations when our soccer club was in disgrace! Nuno 
Dias, also a PhD student in seismology of the Azores assured a fruitful cooperation and 
information exchange which benefited this (and hopefully his) work.  

Pedro Madureira (from U. Évora) also a PhD student in geochemistry and petrology of 
the Azores, is first of all a very close friend, and secondly a colleague with whom I had 
enormous discussions about the Azores and the interpretation of our data. Pedro has 
showed me quite clearly that I ceased to be a full bodied geologist, but I am still not a 
geophysicist. Thank you Pedro for the proof of my precarious position! 

A large amount of this manuscript was written while I was at the EMEPC. I am deeply 
thankful to the head of this organization, Manuel Pinto de Abreu, its Technical 
Coordinator, Fernando Maia Pimentel and remaining EMEPC colleagues for their 
support.

My Family is grand. Mother: thank you for having revised the manuscript. Father: 
thanks for pointing me, at times, the north, and remembering me (in those times) that 
serenity is not just a word. 

To my wife Raquel, no written acknowledgement makes justice to what she had to put 
up with me.  I guess a thank you with the size of the Azores Plateau, for your patience, 
support and help is in order and says it all. This manuscript final stages (or at least my 
strength to accomplish it) also largely benefited from the smiles and laughs of my 
daughters Rita and Maria. 

While the work benefited from many discussions and collaborations with the above 
stated colleagues, all misconceptions or errors present in this manuscript are my full 
responsibility.

Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 

 

Chapter I - Introduction 

The Azores Archipelago consists of nine Islands. The Western group (two Islands) is 

located in the stable North America plate, whilst the Central (five Islands) and the 

Eastern (two Islands) groups lie in the Eurasian (EU)-Nubian (NUB) plate boundary 

area. The Azores Islands, themselves, represent a small emerged area of a vast 

submarine volcanic platform. This platform, roughly defined by the 2000 m isobath, is 

relatable to an excess in volcanism/magmatism. It presents a triangular shape, whose 

western side is located west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. It is limited to the south by the 

East Azores Fracture Zone and to the northwest by the Terceira axis (Machado, 1957). 

Within the Azores plateau a large V-shaped volcanic feature roughly bisected by the 

MAR, designated hereafter as Faial ridge and Flores ridge (after Vogt 1976) is probably 

a result of a major thermal or magmatic event under the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at 10 Ma, 

reflecting the interaction between the so-called Azores hot spot and the Mid-Atlantic 

ridge (Cannat et al., 1999; Escartin et al., 2001, Gente et al., 2003).  

The precise location of the MAR (Figure I.1), which forms the boundary between the 

North American and Eurasian/Nubian plates is well known, particular after the efforts 

developed  in  recent  years  to  map  the ridge system in the Azores area; in contrast, the

exact details and nature of the boundary between the Eurasian and Nubian plates, its 

location  and  segmentation  pattern , the  evolution of this triple junction and the way in 

which tectonic and volcanic processes interact, within the plate boundary zone, remain 

unclear, and has been elusive to geophysical and geological studies, in spite of the 

efforts developed.  

 2 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
The plate boundary between Eurasia and Africa is generally characterized in its 

westernmost part by transtension in a complex area striking WNW-ESE, the Terceira 

Axis, linking the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to the Gloria fault. The spreading rates across the 

plate boundary in the Terceira axis, between Eurasia and African plates amount to 4 

mm/yr in an average N75°E direction (Euler rotation pole located at 19.5°N, 23.7°W, 

Demets et al., 1994). The direction of motion predicted by the global kinematic model 

does not account for all structure orientations and their variations from south to north 

(Lourenço et al., 1998).  

The internal structure of the plateau (Figure I.2) displays a coherent structure of linear 

volcanic ridges developed along fissure systems roughly aligned sub-parallel to the 

Terceira Axis (Lourenço et al., 1998). This axis presents a marked clockwise rotation 

from N110-120º near its intersection with the MAR and which mostly characterizes the 

central Islands (Pico, São Jorge, Terceira); to directions closer to N140º-150º at its 

intersection with the GLORIA fault. These directions appear to characterize the tectonic 

pattern on the Islands and in the extensional basins between them, as well as some 

elongated, volcanic ridges. Guest et al. (1999) suggested that the conical volcanic 

edifices are emplaced at the intersection of tectonic structures with both directions. In 

particular, the Furnas volcano on São Miguel Island, displays such a tectonic setting. 

The seismic activity that constitutes the best tool to trace plate boundaries and interplate 

deformation processes, is characterized by earthquakes with focal mechanisms 

compatible with right-lateral strike-slip faults or normal faults, oriented N120°E to 

N150°E (Grimison and Chen, 1986; Buforn et al., 1988). A strong earthquake (M=7.2), 

however, occurred in 1980, probably on a left-lateral strike-slip fault oriented N150°E, 

according to its focal mechanism and the aftershock distribution (Hirn et al., 1980), 

 3 



 
Chapter I - Introduction 
 
 
implying that the kinematics is not simple in the area. The focal mechanism for the 1998 

Faial earthquake showed also a complex fracture pattern (Fernandes et al., 2002). 

The volcanic activity is distributed over all the Central and Eastern Azores Islands, and 

all record  historical activity. The most recent volcanic activity occurred on the Serreta 

ridge (Luis et al., 1999), northwest of Terceira Island. The WNW-ESE-trending zone of 

volcanic and tectonic activity, which also marks the northeast boundary of the Azores 

plateau, is a rift zone, with a significant part of transtensional motion (leaky transform).  

The ages of the Azores Plateau, the Terceira axis, and the linear volcanic ridge 

structures within the plateau are still unclear. Little constraint is provided by magnetic 

anomalies in what concerns islands evolution, and isotopic age determinations only 

provide an upper bound for the age of these structures. Little is also known about the 

thermal structure (or lithospheric structure) of the Terceira axis and the partition, style 

and dynamics between magmatic and tectonic processes which have shaped the plate 

boundary and the Azores plateau.  

An analysis based on an aeromagnetic survey and the compilation of ship born magnetic 

data of the plateau showed that only the Brunhes and possibly Matuyama magnetic 

epochs can be identified in the rift area, even though the magnetic anomalies generated 

along the mid-Atlantic ridge are disrupted on the plateau (Miranda et al., 1991, Luis et 

al.,  1994).  The lack of   older magnetic   lineations   on either   side   of   the Terceira 

rift suggests that the relative motion between Africa and Eurasia in the westernmost part 

of the plate boundary was accommodated by extension distributed across the plateau 

rather than by accretion focused along the rift. Major questions on the kinematics and 

the dynamics of the area are therefore still unresolved:

Chapter I - Introduction 
 
 
Has the kinematic setting of the plate boundary and of the triple junction changed with 

time, and how?  

Is the North America-Africa-Eurasia Triple junction clearly a ridge-ridge-ridge 

junction? Can we describe the area bounded by two branches of the Eurasia-Africa plate 

boundary as a microplate? Is the triple junction a discrete feature or a complex zone? 

How is the relative motion between Africa and Eurasia accommodated in the 

westernmost part of the plate boundary? Is the motion distributed across the Azores 

plateau? Or does the Terceira rift account for all the relative motion?  

In the following chapters, we will address some of this questions and present results 

from studies in which the author has been involved between 1999 and 2006. The Azores 

plateau is a particularly suitable area to study tectono-magmatic interactions in space 

and time and at different scales. It comprises the existence of a disputed plume or at 

least a significant upper mantle anomaly, hereafter refered as the Azores Hot-Spot 

(AHS) which is considered the main intervining factor for the formation of the Azores 

volcanic plateau.  The internal structure of this plateau can be explained by interaction 

along time of the AHS with both the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) and the Azores Triple 

Junction (ATJ. Significant consequences of this interaction are: the position, kinematic 

and related tectonic response of the ATJ, the distribution of magmatic contribution for 

lithospheric structure and thermal structure of the Azores plateau and on the 

geophysical, geological and biological segmentation pattern of the MAR through time.  

To understand the plateau inner structure and the consequences of AHS-ATJ-MAR 

interaction it is crucial that plate kinematic constraints are provided. Several kinematic 

interpretations have been provided in the past, but all of them fail to integrate a 

 6 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
significant portion of currently available multi-disciplinary data on the Azores plateau. 

In Chapter II, we review critically kinematic models described in the literature; discuss 

the interactions with the AHS they propose. We use morpho-structural and marine 

magnetic data on the Azores and we analyse the consequence of assuming different 

positions in time for the ATJ (i.e. the EU/NUB plate boundary), and test plate tectonic 

reconstructions using Euler stage poles from existing kinematic models. The main 

objective is to evaluate relative ages for the generation of first order bathymetric 

features within the plateau and try to constrain the expectable tectonic response within 

the plateau at each considered geodynamic time interval. 

One of the strategies designed to identify the effects of the present day AHS influence is 

the mapping of seismicity resulting from volcanic and tectonic activity along the MAR.  

This can be done very efficiently with the use of hydrophone arrays, a technique 

developed for submarine acoustic surveying that is now available for scientific use. This 

is discussed in Chapter III. 

The spreading velocities deduced from global models like NUVEL 1A (DeMets et al., 

1994) or based exclusively on GPS-derived models like REVEL (Sella et al., 2002) or 

DEOS2K (Fernandes et al., 2004) yield reduced full spreading velocities, varying from 

3 to 4 mm per year (ultra-slow spreading ridges are classified as such for full spreading 

velocities below 1 cm/yr) for the EU/NUB plate boundary in the Azores. This allows 

the classification of this ridge as one of the slowest of the ridge global system (or hyper-

slow, following Vogt and Jung (2003).  The spatial distribution of the geodetically 

retrieved deformation field starts now to be understood. This is discussed in Chapter IV.  

 7 



 
Chapter I - Introduction 
 
 
The short time span of geodetic observations only provides a snapshot of present day 

kinematic context, which relevance from the tectonic point of view is at least partially 

unknown. In Chapter V, we present and discuss complementary kinematic and tectonic 

markers of active processes that can be identified from the morphotectonic analysis of 

high resolution TOBI sonar. 

This type of approach can be made systematically in the Terceira Island and 

neighbouring areas, where we tentatively infer how tectonics and volcanism do 

distribute and relate to each other. This is the aim of chapter VI. Here we will describe 

in detail the morphology and main geophysical characteristics of an area comprising 

Terceira Island and its neighbouring basins along the Terceira axis. The way volcanic 

and tectonic structures condition each other is analysed by integrating high resolution 

bathymetry and sonar on submerged areas where some new swath and sonar data have 

been collected with high resolution digital elevation models of the Terceira Island and 

meso-scale tectonic observations.  A regional tectonic map is assembled and analysed. 

Directional data are compared with expected EU/NUB differential motion and 

consequently an assessement of fault kinematics and the role they play in magmatic 

accretion in that domain of Terceira axis is performed. 

The smallest spatio-temporal scale is approached in this manuscript considering the 

sequence of tectono-magmatic events that took place in the 1957 and 1958 Capelinhos 

eruption in Faial. In Chapter VII we discuss and interpret the sequence of events which 

resulted on the Surtseyan eruption type (despite that the Faial eruption was prior to the 

1963-1966 Surtsey Island eruption in Iceland) and triggered two strong tectonic shocks 

in faults neighbouring the volcanic fissural system, that links the Island main caldera 

and the eruption site in its western tip. Geodetic and GPS data for 60 years are 

 8 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
compared with 2D crustal dislocations models, resultant from fault slip data inversion. 

A geological interpretation is then performed, about the eruption driving mechanism, 

the earthquakes triggering mechanism and the style of accretion in this linear volcanic 

systems which constitute a significant part of the Azores plateau. 

In Chapter VIII we use analogue modelling techniques to analyse the effect of ridge 

push in ridge extension and transform fault generation, and in particular the case for 

active transform faults which, contrary to what is expectable from fault mechanics, lie 

normal to the ridge axis. Despite approaching normal seafloor spreading ridge sections, 

this topic is relevant within the context of the EU-NUB plate boundary, as in the later 

there are evidences from earthquake activity and fault mapping that similar orthogonal 

geometries exist within the Azores. 

Finally Chapter IX we perform the discussion of the data presented in this manuscript 

and integrate them into a coherent tectonic model for the ruling kinematics conditions at 

the EU-NUB plate boundary and ATJ at the present day. Topics for future researches in 

this complex geodynamical framework are also underlined.

Chapter II - Review of the kinematic Models for the ATJ and AHS 

II.1 Overview 

The evolution and shaping of the Azores Plateau is usually considered as the result of 

the interaction between two key processes: the ATJ instability and the Azores Hot Spot 

(AHS) position in the course of time. Past interpretative models, addressing their roles, 

put little emphasis on their interactions and consequent implications to the birth and 

evolution of the Azores plateau, and thus tend to treat each process as acting stand 

alone. 

Two types of interpretative models have been presented: those which are based on 

constraints provided by kinematic models thus providing plate tectonic reconstructions 

of the previous geometries of the triple junction (Krause and Watkins, 1970;  

McKenzie, 1972; Searle, 1980; Luis et al., 1994) and those that address particular 

aspects of the Azores tectonics, based on morpho-tectonic analysis (Machado et al., 

1957; Madeira and Ribeiro, 1990; Lourenço et al., 1998; Vogt and Jung, 2003), isotopic 

dating (Féraud, 1980), focal mechanisms and earthquake epicenter distributions 

(Miranda et al., 1998) and GPS observations (Fernandes et al., 2004, 2006). Analyses of 

the present-day context of the ATJ will be dealt with later on. 

Here, we present a summary of presented models which are sustained by kinematic 

interpretations; we test their underlying assumptions in respect of available geo-

information. Kinematic models are also confronted with models for the evolution of the 

AHS, notably those of Cannat et al., (1999) and Gente et al., (2003) to try to identify the 

strong links and/or contradictions between both geodynamic histories across time. 

II.2 ATJ Models based on plate kinematic reconstructions 

II.2.1 The ATJ prior to 20 Ma: from Kings through to Gloria Fault 

Regional studies comprising the kinematic evolution of the Atlantic basin, namely the 

evolution of the Gloria fault, always met problems when incorporating the complex 

behaviour of the Iberian microplate, described at times as attached to the Eurasian plate, 

or others attached to the African plate (Bonnin, 1978, Olivet, 1984; Klitgord and 

Schouten, 1986). Some models also consider that during different time intervals, Iberia 

has moved independently from the two larger plates (Galdeano et al., 1989, Srivastava 

et al., 1990a, 1990b and Roest and Srivastava, 1991).  

The analysis of the kinematic behaviour of the Iberian micro-plate is limited by the lack 

of prevalent magnetic lineations, and the difficulties in tracing the homologues of 

Fracture Zone’s traces between the North American Plate (NAM) and Iberian (Canpam, 

1995). A thorough analysis of the evolution of the Iberian micro-plate during the 

opening of the Northern Atlantic basin is out of scope of this work. 

Here we consider just a short summary of the main kinematic events and onset of 

resulting morpho-tectonic features during the course of this evolution since anomaly 

M0, as proposed by Srivastava et al. (1990a) and depicted in Figure II.1. 

After mid-Cretaceous (since anomaly M0, 118 Ma), a triple junction developed at the 

Gulf of Biscay while Iberia is supposed to have shared a common kinematic history 

with Africa. This Triple junction will constitute the main plate boundary during most of 

 12 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
the Atlantic evolution and its trace is defined along the Gulf of Biscay towards a region 

north of the Kings trough. Its behaviour is mainly extensional between anomalies 33 

and 31, and becomes dominantly right lateral strike slip until anomaly 21 times.  

The unstable configuration of the triple junction led to its southward migration and the 

opening of the Kings trough at anomaly 17 times (ca. 37 Ma). The plate boundary then 

becomes defined by the Kings Trough, Azores-Biscay ridge and the Pyrenees chain. 

After anomaly 19 (41.4 Ma) Iberia detached progressively from the African plate, with 

the development of a southern Iberian plate boundary defined by the Gloria fault. The 

northern boundary gradually losses significance and differential motion between 

Eurasia and Iberia plate nearly cease at anomaly 10.   

At anomaly 6c (23.4 Ma) activity on the Kings trough ceases completely and Iberia 

becomes attached to the Eurasian plate. Only one triple junction becomes active at the 

Azores level and the plate boundary is solely located along the Gloria fault.   

This model is disputed as it presents several inconsistencies with inland geology, 

namely with regard to the Pyrenees tectonic history, where major wrench events are 

documented prior to 37.5 Ma. Other difficulties result from the assumption of coupled 

movement between Iberia and Northern Africa as both Atlas, the Rif and the Betics 

were onset prior to anomaly 17 (Canpam, 1995 and references therein).

Figure II.1 - Evolution of the Iberian Microplate since anomaly M25 to anomaly C6. Note the 
definition according to this model of an independent Iberia since anomaly 19 (41.4 Ma) and the 
definition of two triple junctions, one at the north in Kings trough and the southern one defined at 
the Gloria fault. (Srivastava et al., 1990a). 

 

 14 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
Other authors simplify this history and only consider one triple junction active at each 

time thus precluding an independent Iberia.  The transfer of Iberia Lithosphere from 

African plate to the Eurasian plate is signed at anomaly 13 (33.4 Ma) by Ollivet (1984),  

during anomaly 10 (28.3 Ma) by Klitgord and Schouten (1986) or at 25 Ma following 

collision between EU and AF in southern Iberia (Silver et al., 1998). 

As we shall see below, regardless of the preferred model, when one considers plate 

reconstructions confined to a more local scale (the scale of the Azores) it will cause 

significant difficulties and caveats. Moreover, the Azores block presents the same 

degree of obscurity in kinematic terms as the Iberian plate. Its evolution seems to have 

been marked by transference from African to Eurasian megaplates behaving sometimes 

as an independent block. Understanding the behaviour of its northern (Terceira axis) 

and southern (EAFZ) limits is therefore crucial for tracing its evolution. Below, we 

review critically the attempts performed by different authors to constrain it 

II.2.2 The ATJ prior to 20 Ma: from Gloria fault to Terceira axis or to EAFZ? 

Early studies, centred on the characterization of the Azores Triple Junction and the EU-

AF plate boundary, were based on sparse ship-borne bathymetric and magnetic profiles. 

Calculated global or regional Euler poles suffered from similar limitations. 

A first attempt was made by Krause and Watkins (1970) based on the first surface 

magnetic compilation. They considered a RRR (Ridge-Ridge-Ridge) triple junction 

type, with oblique spreading on the Eurasia-African plate boundary. According to these 

authors, such a configuration would have evolved from a RFF triple junction with 

migration of the MAR westwards, south of the EAFZ and change in the spreading 

direction from E-W to ESE-WNW. This re-orientation of the spreading direction would 

 15 



 
Chapter II –Review of the kinematic models for the ATJ and AHS 
 
 
additionally result in the creation of a Leaky transform in the ATJ third arm, which 

would ultimately facilitate the formation of the Terceira axis as a secondary spreading 

center. These authors make no assumptions regarding the stability of the proposed 

configuration but attribute an age of at least 45 Ma for the beginning of the Terceira axis 

leaky transform (Figure II.2).    

McKenzie (1972) reviewed critically this first model and discussed for the first time the 

stability of the ATJ. His model is very similar to that of Krause and Watkins as it 

considers an evolution of the ATJ from an initial RFF configuration originated at the 

junction of the MAR with the EAFZ. Northward migration along the MAR of this triple 

junction would result in the formation of two oblique spreading centers and a RRR type 

triple junction (Figure II.3a). He considered that the Triple Junction is stable through 

time provided that all three branches would spread obliquely. Contrary to the previous 

one, this model precludes change in the spreading direction but as noted by McKenzie 

(1972), it would imply a tendency for the ATJ to migrate northward.

Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
Both models imply the existence of a triangular domain of Azores topography with apex 

on the triple Junction, bisected by the Terceira axis. The present knowledge of the 

Azores plateau as we shall discuss in up-coming sections, its morpho-structural and the 

magnetic anomalies patterns and the kinematic conditions which subsisted through time 

allow us to refute this models as un-realistic

(1980), pattern expresses lithosphere sections transferred from the Eurasian to the African plate 
due to onset of the Terceira axis (From Searle, 1980). 

 

The first strongly documented work on the Azores was produced by Searle (1980), 

using ship-borne magnetic and Gloria lateral sonar mosaics. Searle re-evaluated the 

previous interpretations and defined a first overall segmentation pattern in the Terceira 

axis. In his interpretation (Figure II.3b), the Azores Triple Junction evolves, again from 

the EAFZ intersection with the MAR, as a RFF (Ridge-Fault-Fault) configuration, to a 

position defined at the intersection between the Terceira axis and the MAR at the North 

Azores Fracture Zone, due to a sudden northward jump of the triple junction. A

triangular section of previous Eurasian generated lithosphere would than be truncated 

by Terceira axis generation and transferred to the African plate.. 

Searle (1980) was however renitent in assuming the present ATJ position on the NAFZ, 

on grounds of the orientation of this Fracture zone with respect to predicted directions 

of opening between Eurasian and African plates (closer to ca. N58º), and does not 

exclude, considering the tectonic fabric interpreted from the sonar images and the recent 

volcanic activity, that the Triple Junction could be located further south around 38º 40’ 

N in the region west of Faial. He further considered the Terceira axis as a spreading 

center but does not exclude the possibility, given the numerous linear ridges running 

sub-parallel to the Terceira axis, that true seafloor spreading generating Azores crust 

could be limited and the Azores would therefore represent a rift zone with a high 

complex architecture resulting from a mélange of crust generated previously at the 

MAR predated by Azores generated crust possibly along pre-existing tectonic 

structures.  

Finally, an assumption is made by this author concerning the age of the Triple junction 

migration and beginning of the Terceira axis. By extrapolating the calculated spreading 

of ca 3 mmyr-1 to the width of the spreading center (along the spreading direction), he 

reaches an age of 55 Myr as an upper bound, although he assumes 36 Myr as more 

realistic age for the generation of the Terceira axis, as a result of changes between the 

African and Eurasian plates relative movement (Figure II.4).  

II.2.3 The ATJ in the last 10 Ma: fine scale evolution of Triple Junction 

Luís et al. (1994) and Luis (1996) presented a new Azores plateau aeromagnetic chart 

with  a  much  higher  level  of  definition  than previous ones (cf. Figure II.5). This new

magnetic anomaly map allowed them to perform a highly detailed kinematic analysis of 

the ATJ confined to the last 10 Ma.  It revealed the recent evolution of the segmentation 

pattern of the MAR and in particular several northward migrations of the Eurasia-

African-North America triple junction, from a past location near 37° N up to its present 

location interpreted to lay on Pico-Faial alignment with the Mid-Atlantic ridge. Their 

proposed evolution comprises: from Chron 5 to Chron 3 (~10-3.85 Ma) existence of an 

independently moving Azores block detached from both Eurasian and African plate. 

 19 



 
Chapter II –Review of the kinematic models for the ATJ and AHS 
 
 
During this time span two triple junctions were active at the northern and southern 

boundaries of the block. They could only constrain the position of the southern one 

initially at 38º00’N, 38º50’W and gradually jumping north to 38º20’N, 30º15’ W 

between C4 and C3A.  At C2A (2.45 Ma), ATJ reaches its present position at 38º55’N, 

30º00’W. From that time on, they consider that the Azores block moves attached to the 

Eurasian plate.  

This analysis was however based on plate tectonic reconstructions with regards to the 

MAR, and little can be inferred about the tectonic implications of their proposed ATJ 

evolution within the plateau. For example, the northward migration of the southern ATJ 

implicitly implies that some amount of internal deformation should exist within the 

Azores block, and also that sections of Azores block lithosphere have possibly been 

transferred to the African plate, as also suggested by Searle (1980). Lack of constraints 

on the kinematic behavior and position of the northern ATJ from the past until anomaly 

2A, limits the ability to understand the Azores Plateau evolution through time. 

II.3 Testing two kinematic models for the evolution of the ATJ  

Triple junctions are intrinsically unstable features (Cronin, 1992) and several authors 

(e.g. Bird et al., 1998 and 1999; Rusby and Searle, 1995; Mitchell and Livermore, 1998) 

have suggested that the approach to be followed when performing plate tectonic 

reconstructions in these domains should account for tectonic explanations rather than 

performing strict kinematic reconstructions. The problem of using a purely kinematic 

approach has been addressed by Cox and Heart (1986) as “The three plate problem”, 

where in a triple junction defined by three plates A, B and C, if one rotates plates A and 

B relative to the C, about fixed Euler poles than relative movement between plates A 

and B cannot be described by a fixed Euler pole through time.

anomaly 5 to the present. The axis is marked by the heavy line. The arrows represent the velocity of 
the Azores and Africa relative to North American Plate.  AF-Africa; Ac – Azores; AM – America; 
EU – Eurasia; EAFZ – East Azores Fracture Zone, PFZ – Pico Fracture Zone; PAFZ – Princess 
Alice Fracture Zone; AFZ – Açor Fracture Zone; FFZ – Faial Fracture Zone; NAFZ – North 
Azores fracture Zone. 

 

The attempt to resolve the different positions of the ATJ and the configuration of the 

EU/AF plate boundary through time in the Azores using kinematic models has two 

additional obstacles linked with the intrinsic nature of the plateau and provided by the 

unstable triple junction configuration of this domain: 

1. The EU/AF (or EU/NUB) plate boundary, with some exceptions around Terceira 

axis, does not provide a coherent pattern of seafloor magnetic anomalies, thus not 

providing consistent isochrones for plate tectonic reconstructions; 

 21 



 
Chapter II –Review of the kinematic models for the ATJ and AHS 
 
 
2. There are no clear transform faults across the Azores plateau that can provide plate 

spreading direction constraints through time. 

Here, we use the isochrons from Luis et al. (1996) and Canpam (1995) to check the 

consistency of plate reconstructions and the validity of kinematic models presented in 

section II.2.2. We consider specifically their underlying hypothesis that Pico is the N. 

American plate structural analogue of the EAFZ, which, as presented previously, is 

generally assumed as the plate boundary between EU and AF from times prior to at 

least anomaly 6 in those models. 

Anomaly picks from these authors complement each other. Canpam (1995) picked 

anomalies covering a wider region from the Northern and Central Atlantic, whereas 

Luis et al., (1994) and Luis (1996) chrons were retrieved from a denser aero-magnetic 

map centred on the Azores region and therefore allowing a more detailed analysis of 

this region. Magnetic anomalies selected for this approach are C13 (33.4 Ma), C6 (20.1 

Ma), C5 (9.8 Ma) on all three plates. The magnetic time scale is from Cande and Kent 

(1995). Their anomalies are displayed in Figure II.6.   

The figure reveals that magnetic anomaly picks display a rather close pattern with the 

exception of anomaly C13. Due to higher resolution of the aero-magnetic chart in the 

Azores area, Luis was able to trace within the plateau, a trail of points for anomalies C5 

and C6. Canpam does not consider any anomalies within the plateau and only traces 

them to the intersection with the Terceira axis to the north and with the EAFZ to the 

south. The definition of anomalies south of the Pico F.Z and in the African plate is 

sparse due to very poor quality of existing magnetic data and the fit between both 

authors is poor probably due to the magnetic time scale choosen.

To perform our kinematic analysis, we consider two sets of poles, presented in Table 

II.1 for the NAM/AF and the EU/AF and NAM/IB. Apart from the poles presented in 

Table II.1 there are a considerable amount of poles calculated for these plate pairs. 

Analysing them is out of the scope of this work. For the interested reader, an exhaustive 

list of finite rotation poles describing the relative movement of EU and AF with regard 

to NAM can be accessed through Mirone (Luis, in press), a software which, amongst 

other tasks, allows finite rotations of graphic elements in a geographical space1.

II.3.1 Constraints provided by stage pole rotations 

The method of describing the relative motion between Eurasian and Nubia plates 

consists on the estimation of rotation parameters between these two plate pairs, by 

studying their relative movement to the NAM plate. Finite rotation poles between 

African (AF) and Eurasia (EU) can therefore be calculated by: 

AFROT EU (t) = AFROTNA(t)+NAROTEU(t)       (II.1) 

Where AROTB(t) is the rotational parameters (latitude, longitude and angle) of the finite 

rotation of plate A relative to plate B for a given time (t). 

Stage poles (describing plates relative movement between time intervals), can, on the 

other hand, be calculated by finite rotations as below. 

EUROTAF (C6-0) + EUROTAFR(0-C5) =EUROTAF(C6-C5)    (II.2) 

Stage poles are here used to provide an assessment of the tectonic regimes acting on the 

Azores plateau during discrete time intervals. This is achieved by rotating a set of 

elements from their expected initial locations at the oldest time considered and trace 

their circuit from that initial time to the present. One should bear in mind that the vector 

for each time interval only provides an integral measurement of the total displacement 

and not the incremental path within the time interval under consideration.  

To perform this analysis we calculated the stage poles using equations (1) and (2) for set 

of poles 1 and we also used stage poles calculated by Canpam (1995) from her finite 

rotations poles. The resulting stage poles are presented in Table II.2.

Figure II.7 and Table II.3, display the results of the rotation using the calculated stage 

poles, for a set of points distributed along the East Azores Fracture Zone and Gloria 

fault. Rotations are performed assuming points belong to Eurasian plate at the time of 

anomaly C13 and considering a fixed African plate. Their circuit comprises therefore 

three stages from C13 to C6 (20 Ma), from C6 to C5 (10 Ma), and from C5 to the 

present. 

We verify that, regardless of the poles series chosen, the bulk tectonic regime during the 

growth and evolution of the Azores was transtensional with a variable component of 

right lateral shear. The initial rotation between C13 and C6 is characterized by a 

transtensional regime dominated by extension in a N10º to a N13º direction between AF 

and EU plates. In this instance, rotations with the two pole series differ drastically in 

spreading velocities.  

The spreading directions between both time series vary more significantly between C6 

and C0. During this time span both are characterized by an increase in the lateral shear 

component of transtension. In Pole series 1, the bulk extensional direction changes to 

 26 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
approximately SW-NE between C6 and C5, and then to WSW-ENE from C5 to the 

present. These later spreading directions are very similar to that retrievable form 

NUVEL1A for AF/EU, which vary between N65º to N70º from West to East across the 

plateau (DeMets et al., 1994). Pole series 2 rotates from WSW-ENE to a nearly E-W 

spreading direction therefore suggesting a more oblique spreading with respect to the 

strike of the main plateau morphological features. The spreading direction predicted by 

the stage poles series 2 between C5 and C0 is very similar to the present day spreading 

direction retrieved from global and regional geodetic models based solely on GPS 

observations like the Revel2000 (Sella et al., 2002) and Deos2K (Fernandes et al., 2006, 

see also chapter IV).  

Considering the orientation of small wavelength relief generation like the linear 

volcanic ridges and assuming that they were formed in a context of pure traction, then 

the possible timings for their generation can be constrained by kinematic scenarios 

outlined in Figure II.7 and Table II.3.  

From C13 and C6, considering Pole Series 1, the optimally oriented structures for pure 

shear extension within the Azores domain are the EAFZ and some significant linear 

features such as the linear volcanic ridge trending E-W between 25º30’W and 26º30’W 

at the latitude of Terceira Island and the E-W elongated plateau which culminates in the 

S. Miguel Island (Figure II.7). The orientation of these structures supports the 

consideration that their growth is controlled by pré-existing FZ (Guest et al., 1999). 

Their favorable orientation with respect to direction of extension during that time span, 

could have promoted FZ reactivation and extension.  Other  E-W  south  facing 

morphological steps between flat horizontal, probably highly sedimented terraces at ca. 

38ºN between 26ºW and 27º30’W, might have been favored in the same time interval.

Chapter II –Review of the kinematic models for the ATJ and AHS 
 
 
The remaining orientations of the linear volcanic ridges in the central sector of the 

Plateau do not fit this pattern of fracture zone reactivation and their generation can be 

linked to the migration northwards of the Triple junction as discussed. Stage poles from 

both time series and corresponding extension directions favor their generation at a time 

younger than 20 Ma.  

The linear volcanic ridges in the plateau western sector (corresponding to the Central 

group Islands of Pico-Faial and S. Jorge), considering their orientations, may again 

result from reactivation of some Fracture Zone sections, their growth as magmatic 

systems is favoured between anomaly 6 and 5, taking Poles Series 1 or in right lateral 

transtensional considering Poles series 2.  As we shall see later on (in chapter VII), to 

some extent, magmatic growth of these structures can be considered irrespective of far-

field stresses, and more conditioned by local circumstances such as internal magma 

pressure, and magma migration mechanisms. 

II.3.2 Is the Pico FZ the structural homologue of the EAFZ?  

The approach from previous section does not allow constraining the position of the ATJ 

for a given time, as the chosen points used for rotation with the stage poles have 

arbitrary positions with respect to the plate boundary for that time. They only provide a 

measure of expectable plate boundary tectonic behavior. To constraint the position of 

the ATJ at specific time intervals, we performed finite rotations between morpho-

tectonic elements and isochrones using the two poles series presented in table II.1. Plate 

tectonic reconstructions were performed aiming at verification of the hypothesis that 

Pico and EAFZ are structurally homologue structures.  

 30 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
 If one considers that the ATJ was located at the EAFZ-Pico FZ at the times C13 (33 

Ma) and C6 (20 Ma), and that depart of the ATJ from this position has started in a 

younger age, than the finite rotation of the points marking the intersection of each chron 

with the Pico F.Z from the American plate with NAM-EU and NAM-AF finite poles 

should plot over the position (in present coordinates) of the EAFZ. The results of this 

approach are presented in Figures II.8 and II.9. 

These reveal a large misfit and a poor closure of the ATJ at each time interval 

considered. For example at C13 time (33.4 Ma), the misfit in the position between 

stable EU/NAM and stable AF/NAM finite rotations of the equivalent point in the N. 

American Plate is of ca. 87 km using poles from series 1. Considering poles from series 

2 the misfit is larger, ca. 146 km. Even if we consider the mismatch in the overlap 

between Canpam magnetic anomaly picks of C13NAM with respect to C13EU after 

finite rotation (about 73 km), the resulting misfit in Pico F.Z with respect to EAFZ 

would still be in the order of 73 km.  

These misfits between the Pico FZ and the EAFZ in present day coordinates observed in 

both Figures II.8 and II.9, regardless of the kinematic model chosen as a reference; 

imply that, no simple kinematic closure of the three plates at the ATJ can be achieved.  

Poles in series 1 and 2, perform relatively well in fitting the Pico FZ to the EAFZ after 

rotation, when using NAM/AF poles. Therefore, EAFZ migth have acted as a plate 

boundary fault between the northern limit of stable AF and the Azores domain. We shall 

refer to this limit from now on as the SATJ (Southern Azores Triple Junction).

Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
Between C13 and C6, if the SATJ was located at the EAFZ, then this structure should 

have been subject to a significant component of pure traction, as already suggested in 

the previous section. When considering the width of the Fracture Zone, we verify that in 

its eastern section, between 26º42’W and 27º54’W, the fracture zone valley is wider 

(~16 km) than its western section were the valley is well marked by a narrow PTDZ of 

ca. 8 km. So, considering the values presented in Table II.3, probably the older sections 

of the EAFZ have been subject to a greater amount of extension, but the bulk of the C13 

to C6 extension had also to be partitioned in other plate boundary structures located 

northwards.

transform valley from the central to the eastern topographical profile. In the western profile, the 
transform valley dies out and only a major south facing scarp is present.

The transition between these two EAFZ domains is set at -27º54’W (Figure II.11). This 

location marks the beginning of a NW trending valley that roots into the EAFZ. and 

then inflects to a more WNW-ESE direction, terminating in wedge shape depression 

which cuts through Faial ridge, south of the condor Bank and defines the Princess Alice 

bank to the South.  

This structure has been interpreted by Vogt and Jung (2003) as the morphological trace 

of the SATJ northward migration as a failed rift. Therefore, narrowness of the EAFZ 

west of this point, might represent the last increments of this structure as a major plate 

boundary fault. The lithosphere section imprisoned between this structure and the 

termination of the EAFZ trace might correspond to Azores lithosphere accreted onto the 

AF plate.

Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
Following an analogue procedure, we constrained the northern plate boundary between 

a stable Eurasian plate and the Azores domain by rotation of Pico FZ about NAM/EU 

finite Euler poles. Upon rotation, its position is to northerly with respect to the EAFZ. 

At C13, it lies in a point at the junction between the N-S striking Monaco Bank and the 

Western tip of S. Miguel Island. At C6, it lies in a point ca. 38º N 27º W, which pins a 

clear change in attitude of magnetic anomaly C6 from NNW-SSE to NNE-SSW as 

picked by Luis et al. (Figure II.6).  

By analogy to the SATJ, the trace of rotated Pico using NAM-EU finite rotation poles 

tying this points is considered here as representative of the southern border of a 

kinematically stable Eurasian plate, and will be referred to as the NATJ – (Northern 

Azores Triple Junction). 

The southern limit of a stable Eurasian plate, lying south of the Terceira axis, given the 

positions of rotated elements referred to above, cannot be linked to any clear first order 

morpho-tectonic signature in present day topography within the Azores plateau. This 

has two implications: either the present day topography was shaped more recently, 

possibly as a result of masking effects due to later tectono-magmatic events, or the 

NATJ was never a discrete feature during the all time span, but rather corresponded to a 

zone of distributed deformation. 

The broad lens resulting from the mismatches in the ATJ closure (cf. Figure II.8 and 

II.9) provides an integral measure of Azores deformation during the ATJ evolution from 

33.4 Ma to the onset of the SATJ migration, and leads to the hypothesis that an Azores 

domain, with a kinematic behavior independent of the two neighboring larger plates, has 

subsisted at least from anomaly 13 to anomaly 5 when EAFZ ceases its activity. 

 35 



 
Chapter II –Review of the kinematic models for the ATJ and AHS 
 
 
Moreover, as at C13 no ATJ closure can be achieved, right lateral transtension within 

this plate boundary surely started prior to this age. 

It remains unclear if the response to this deformation in the EU/AF plate boundary was 

accommodated solely at the Mid-Atlantic ridge, for example by the re-arrangement of 

the segmentation pattern, with possible growth of segments, by re-orientation of 

existing ones and break-up of new non-transform discontinuities of higher orders, which 

would ultimately lead to geometrical repositioning of the MAR axis. If this has been the 

case, then the independent Azores domain grew solely from ridge dynamics and 

therefore some equivalent offaxis signature should be traceable in the North American 

plate. Lack of definition in existing data does not allow at present the verification of this 

hypothesis.  

Another possibility can be considered: if Azores domain generation has resulted from 

tectonic-magmatic processes at the EU/AF plate boundary itself in the MAR off-axis 

domain. This could be achieved, for instance as re-activation of fracture zones as leaky 

structures or as formation of new fault zones within the active plate boundary domain. 

In this case, instability and northward migration of both Azores domain northern and 

southern limits would result from an intra-transform context, such as in some pacific 

micro-plates like Easter, Galapagos and Juan Fernandez (Bird et al.,1998; Bird et al., 

1999; Naar and Hey, 1991),  as a tectonic response to ruling kinematics conditions for 

each time interval. The morphological evidences for the SATJ migration from the 

EAFZ, favor this second hypothesis; even so, some of the SATJ and NATJ dynamics 

through time can be accounted from magmatic pulses resulting from AHS activity as we 

shall refer to below in section II.4.  

 36 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 

II.4 The Azores Hotspot 

In the previous section, we considered the behavior of the ATJ along the time. We shall 

now consider the different models describing the nature and dynamics of the AHS and 

later we will address how they do mutually fit in. 

In a time where there is a ongoing strong scientific community debate for or against 

mantle plume dynamics, relevance of mantle convection vs. plate tectonic controls, 

possible degrees of interaction with overlaying tectonic plates and even if plumes do 

exist at all (see for details www.mantleplumes.org), it is relevant to recall that the AHS 

remains a controversial topic in scientific literature.  

The nature and dynamics of this mantle surge and the variations of the magma flux to 

the plateau is of key importance to understand the Azores geodynamic evolution and to 

constrain issues such as:  1) existence and style of hot spot trace paths across the 

plateau; 2) present day position and area extent of the AHS; 3) Spatial-temporal 

distribution of magma generation and constraints on the age of the plateau, its inner 

structures and the Azores Archipelago Islands; 4) degree of interaction with the Azores 

Triple Junction evolution through time, and therefore 5) relation with past and present 

plate boundary configuration between Eurasian and Nubian plates, current location and 

tectonic style of the Azores Triple Junction. Many of these points remain controversial 

or unanswered, even between those who share favorable views on the Azores mantle 

plume existence.  

One point which remains nevertheless undisputed: the Azores volcanic platform results 

from an excess in volcanism/magmatism. Accordingly, the crustal structure of the 

Azores is equally anomalous (Escartin et al., 2001; Searle, 1976; Miranda et al., 1998; 

 37 

http://www.mantleplumes.org/


 
Chapter II –Review of the kinematic models for the ATJ and AHS 
 
 
Matias, in press). Only the sub-lithospheric causes of this magmatic excess remain 

controversial.  

Numerous observations show evidence of an interaction between hot spots and Mid-

ocean ridges at various levels: a thermal interaction, resulting in more crust being 

generated near hot spots, a geochemical interaction, implying a mixture of depleted 

mantle sources feeding the mid-ocean ridges and enriched mantle sources of the hot 

spot, and finally a dynamic interaction, responsible for the migration of second-order 

segments away from the hot spots, and of an asymmetry of the accretion processes 

(Müller, 1998; Hardarson et al., 1997, Small, 1995). Frequent observations of spreading 

asymmetry and ridge jumps in sections of mid-ocean ridges close to hot spots suggest 

that mantle flow from the hot spot may control the distribution of stresses in the 

lithosphere above it (Ito et al., 2003; Mittelstaedt and Ito, 2005)  

For the Azores case, available publications tend to address the evolution of the AHS and 

ATJ as two independent realities, and little effort is made in the integration of their 

common history. Yet, it is recognized unequivocally by the generality of the authors, 

that both have interacted strongly at least from the past 20 Ma. 

II.4.1 Nature of the Azores Hot-Spot (AHS) 

The AHS has been interpreted in a diverse number of ways. The plateau bathymetric 

anomaly is attributed as te outcome of activity from: a plume detached head (Silveira 

and Stutzmann, 2002 and Silveira et al., 2006; Courtillot et al., 2003) a plume deeply 

rooted in the lower mantle (Montelli et al., 2004) or with minor geochemical 

contributions from it (Madureira et al., 2005);  as a classical Hawain type hot-spot 

(Gente et al, 2003), a wet spot (Schiling et al., 1975; Bonnati et al, 1990), an un-

 38 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
specified mantle anomaly (Mitchell et al., 2004);  a plume related thermal/melt anomaly 

(Escartin et al., 2001, Cannat et al., 1999), or finally refuted as a plume related 

topographical expression (Anderson, 2001;  Luis and Neves, 2006;  Favela and 

Anderson, 2000). 

These discrepancies illustrate well the lack of scientific consensus with regard to this 

region and the meaning of the processes which have acted upon it. One of the main 

arguments favoring the AHS is its influence on the MAR, an effect which has been 

relatively well studied (Schilling, 1985; Detrick et al., 1995; Bourdon et al., 1996; 

Cannat et al., 1999; Escartin et al., 2001). The AHS- MAR interaction is expressed by 

an asymmetrical bathymetric anomaly along axis extending from Kurtchakov FZ at 41º 

N at least to the Hayes Fracture Zone (at ~33.5ºN) (Goslin et al., 1999), but it is 

arguable that it extends further south to the Kanes F. Z. (at 24ºN) (Escartin et al., 

(2001). the MAR mid-valley is shallowest within the Azores. This bathymetry long 

wave-length variation is consistent with other gradients such as gravity anomalies 

(Detrick et al., 1995, Luis et al., 1998) and geochemical anomalies documented on 

basalts both in the axial domain (Dosso et al., 1999, White et al., 1976) and in the off-

axis domain (Bougault et al., 1985).  

All these long wavelength variations suggest either that the mantle is anomalously hot 

and/or enriched (Cannat et al., 1999). Modeling of the effect of hot-spots on ridge 

bathymetry and melt production is primarily a function of the plume flux (itself a 

function of temperature and size of the plume head), mantle viscosity, spreading rate 

and absolute motion of the ridge with respect to the plume (Escartin et al, 2001), 

considering the Azores context, Ito and Lin, (1995) calculated values of approximately 

70º C for temperature anomalies related with the Azores plume.  

 39 



 
Chapter II –Review of the kinematic models for the ATJ and AHS 
 
 
Other contradictory views were presented by Bonatti (1990) based on the application of 

geothermometers on peridotite and basaltic material. Based on the high volatiles content 

for samples collected in the Azores region which reach two to three times normal 

MORB, he considered that this would have a significant impact in lowering the mantle 

solidus temperature curve therefore promoting high degrees of partial melting without 

the existence of a significant mantle temperature anomaly in the Azores.  

Gravimetric modelling of the plateau (Luis et al., 1998) and recent application of 

regional 3D admittance studies in the spectral domain (Luis and Neves, 2006) suggest 

that the plateau is regionally compensated and its shallow topography is supported by 

regional lithospheric flexure.  These authors rule out the role dynamic forces maintained 

by mantle upwelling as the cause for the bathymetric surge.  

II.4.2 Spatial location of the hot spot 

There are no consensus on the areal extent and present location of the AHS nowadays.  

Tomographic models have been used to constrain the AHS position. Zhang and 

Tanimoto, (1992) report anomalously low S-wave velocities marking the hot spot 

influence in a large area, slightly east of the MAR. Silveira and Stuztmann, (2002) 

presented a first regional tomographic model with anisotropy retrieved from surface 

wave velocities. Their model reveals that the Azores related SV velocity anomaly fades 

at a depth of 150 km and is not linked with any deeply rooted structure (Figure II.12). 

Yang et al. (2006), using P wave tomography, also documented a generalized low 

velocity anomaly at a depth of ~100 km underneath the Azores. At higher depths (100-

200 km) this anomaly becomes elongated along the NE-SW direction and at depths 

from 250 km to 400 km they position the anomaly related with the AHS in a pipe like 

structure NE of Terceira. 

 40 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
Other authors consider a location for the AHS 100 to 200 km to the east of the ridge in 

the Island of Faial (Schiling, 1991, Ito and Lin, 1995, Silver et al.,1998) or nearby 

Terceira Island (Moreira et al., 1999; Madureira et al., 2005), consistently the shallower 

and more volcanically focused domain within the Azores plateau.  Escartin et al. (2001) 

places the AHS some 300 km east of the Princesa Alice in the vicinities of the S. Miguel 

Island, based on extrapolation of the HS2 model to times older than 3.2 Ma. Given this 

disparities we conclude that the current position and the lateral extent of the AHS plume 

head are not coherently described by the different aproaches and remain still uncertain.

II.4.3 Dynamics of the Azores Hot Spot 

Plume dynamics over time has always been constrained in a context of its interaction 

with the MAR and situated spatial-temporally within the kinematic framework given by 

 41 



 
Chapter II –Review of the kinematic models for the ATJ and AHS 
 
 
seafloor spreading on this ridge system. It’s interaction with the ATJ third branch over 

time has always been subdued probably due to inherent complexities of this plate 

boundary. Below, we describe two contradictory models of interaction between the 

AHS and the MAR overtime: 

The interaction between the hot spot and the Mid-Atlantic ridge appears to be 

responsible for a major thermal or magmatic event under the Mid-Atlantic Ridge 10 Ma 

ago, leading to the formation of part of the Azores Plateau, and an increase of crustal 

thickness between 5 and 8 km (Cannat et al., 1999; Escartin et al., 2001). This thermal 

anomaly has propagated southward along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge axis. Following a 

decrease in crustal production at the MAR since 5 Ma, the volcanic plateau was split 

into two branches, diachronically, forming the V-shaped structure marking the south of 

the present Azores plateau (Figure I.1). The decrease in crustal production at the MAR 

may have resulted from a reduction in the hot spot activity, or from a change in the 

dynamics of the interaction between the MAR and the hot spot.  

No other event of this type has been recognized yet, in particular no other V-shaped 

volcanic ridge is observed within, or outside the main one. This model assumes that the 

AHS was centered along the ridge axis at the time of Chron 5, which corresponded at 

that time to the SATJ defined at the intersection between EAFZ, Pico FZ and the MAR 

in a RFF configuration. In subsequent times, while the melt anomaly migrated along the 

ridge axis. The considered fixed plume migrated NE into the Azores Plateau at a rate of 

~20 km/Ma, following the southwestward absolute motion of the Ridge and adjoining 

plates, considering the HS2 reference frame. Southwestward migration of this thermal 

anomaly would have occurred at a rate of 60 km/Ma, according to those authors.

Gente et al, 2003 have proposed a model constraining the interaction between the MAR 

and the AHS from 85 Ma to the present. They take Canpam (1995), earlier referred in 

this work as the kinematic reference model for their reconstructions. Plate kinematic 

reconstructions have revealed some key features and relations between the Azores 

plateau, Hot Spot activity and neighbouring structures like the Great Meteor on the 

African plate and the Corner Rise in the North American plate. However, as stated by 

the authors:  

 43 



 
Chapter II –Review of the kinematic models for the ATJ and AHS 
 
 
“no precise inference should be drawn from our reconstructions on the detailed 

evolution of the Azores-Gibraltar line that marks the Africa-Eurasia Plate Boundary”.  

Their model is sketched in Figure II.13 and can be summarised as follows: The 

interaction between the AHS and the MAR starts at 85 Ma and results in the formation 

of the Great Meteor seamounts (in the African Plate) and the Corner Rise in the 

American Plate (see Figure I.1 for location). Northeastward migration of this interaction 

along the MAR axis continues until anomaly 6 (20 Ma) resulting in the early stages of 

Azores Plateau formation. Between anomalies 6 and 5 (10 Ma) plume influence in 

centred in the Azores plateau and its interaction with the MAR gradually loses 

significance. At 7 Ma the Azores plateau is fully formed and the melt generation arising 

from plume activity ceases, this stage marks again the onset of normal seafloor 

spreading at the MAR north of latitude 38º.  In the Southern part of the plateau Rifting 

of the Azores plateau started at C3 (4 Ma) and results in the formation of both Flores 

and Faial ridges (also referred as West Jussieu and East Jussieu plateaus) as independent 

morpho-tectonic features. The authors assume that the Azores plume is currently 

centred below Terceira Island.  

II.5 Discussion  

II.5.1 Interaction between the Azores Hot Spot and the Azores Triple Junction 

Constraints on the formation of the Azores plateau and its inner structure are sometimes 

attributed to the kinematic evolution of the ATJ, others to the action of the AHS as we 

have just seen. It seems clear that their concurrence in space and time is bound to have 

promoted some degree of interaction between these two main processes.  

 44 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
If it is clear that the AHS, resulted in the formation of thicker than normal oceanic crust 

and the shaping of the anomalously shallow bathymetry; the geometry of the plateau,  

its internal structure, and the northeastern and southeastern limits within the EU/AF 

plate boundary (i.e Terceira axis and EAFZ)  are clear tectonic features. This suggests 

that the surface expression of the excess in magmatism is tectonically controlled.  

Considering both the kinematic constraints of the ATJ and the models for the evolution 

of the AHS, it results that the Azores deformation history started prior to any relevant 

spatial influence of the AHS trace in this plate boundary domain. The models used in 

section II.2.4 suggest that beginning of transtension started prior to anomaly 13 (i.e 33.4 

Ma). According to Gente et al., (2003) the position of the hot spot, considering an 

absolute reference frame, should be to southerly to bear important interactions or 

consequences to the Triple Junction. 

The age of the plateau and intrinsically the age of the Terceira axis are still subject to 

considerable scatter in estimates. For example Canpam et al. (1995) sets an age for this 

features as early as 36 Ma age. Vogt and Jung (2003) have defined 24 Ma as its limiting 

age, Searle (1980) considers an estimate of 36 Ma. Given that the bathymetric anomaly 

does not surpass C6, in the North American Plate it is plausible that the bulk of its 

construction should have occurred prior to this age. As observed earlier, models 

considering the AHS evolution also point to an estimate of 20 Ma for the beginning of 

the most important period of AHS-MAR interaction which reaches a maximum at 

approximately 10 Ma (C5) and then gradually decreases activity from 7 Ma to the 

present.

Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
Presented models in section II.2.3 differ essentially in the proposed mechanisms for the 

generation of the Faial and Flores ridges and the implications on the AHS dynamic 

through time. The model proposed by Cannat et al. (1999) considers that the rifting 

event leading to these main morpho-structures is essentially diachronical an directed 

south westward. Conversely, Gente et al. (2003) considered a more typical hot spot 

trace migrating progressively northward and associate the rifting of this plateau to a 

single event which started some 7 Ma ago when abnormal hot spot derived excess in 

magmatism ceased. 

When considering the implications of both models addressing the possible 

consequences to the ATJ of the prevalence of hot spot related activity within the plateau 

in time, several limitations arise: 

MAR generated magnetic anomalies, namely those that mark the onset of the plateau 

(C6 and C5) are still traceable within the plateau, as we have seen in section 1.2.1, and 

these seem inconsistent with widespread hot-spot influence of AHS on the plateau build 

up.  To render the hypothesis valid, then the southern termination of anomalies 5 and 6, 

as picked by Luis et al. (1994), within the Plateau must be re-examined. 

The magnetic anomalies of the Faial and Flores ridges are broadly positive, which 

seems to refute the dyachronical nature of these structures proposed by Cannat et al. 

(1999). Moreover from a geometric point of view, it is difficult to justify Cannat 

hypothesis that the plume was centred on the Ridge axis and was the key factor in the 

generation of the plateau. The plateau morphological asymmetry, with respect to the 

present MAR position, cannot be accounted by the referred ridge axis migration.  

 47 



 
Chapter II –Review of the kinematic models for the ATJ and AHS 
 
 
The prolongation westward of the EAFZ transform valley bordering the southern 

termination of the Faial ridge and the Azores plateau as an abrupt morphological step 

facing south is difficult to cope with a northward migration of the AHS, as its 

interaction with the EAFZ should blur its surface expression and not be limited by it. A 

more consistent behavior can be observed in the NAM plate where the Pico FZ 

terminates quite abruptly eastwards against the plateau.  

Finally, the morpho-structure of Terceira axis itself, where deep basin occur, does not 

seem immediately linkable to a widespread excess in magmatism hot spot, relatable if 

this structure would have defined the northern boundary of the Azores plateau since at 

least anomaly C6 as represented in numerous models namely those of  Gente et al. 

(2003) and Cannat et al. (1999). 

II.5.2 Onset of SATJ northwards Migration  

Considering Gente et al. (2003) model as a complete portrait of AHS dynamic through 

time, then what can we anticipate to be the response of the ATJ to the progressing AHS 

northwards? 

Probably a combination of changing kinematic conditions depicted in section II.2 

associated with the body forces resultant from topography build up, might have induced 

a tectonic response which resulted in strain re-localization and redefinition of the plate 

boundary, as AHS migration would proceed. 

As suggested by Vogt and Jung (2003), the abandonment of the SATJ from the EAFZ 

and its progressive migration northward seems to have been crucial to the development 

of the Azores plateau internal structure. Vogt and Jung (2003) attribute the generation of 

the LVR, as a succession of failed rifts following this TJ migration, concomitant with 

 48 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
the progressive hot spot track also to the north. As we shall see later (see Chapter V) we 

favor a somewhat different interpretation as we consider that the western linear volcanic 

ridge domain has at present a significant tectono-magmatic activity and constitutes a 

part of inter-plate boundary zone. 

Timing the onset of this migration is of key importance for the age relationship of 

morphological features within the plateau.  We interpret the triple junction migration as 

a process that generated from a intra-transform setting between C6 and C5 and 

terminated post east Jussieu plateau formation. The fact that the valley that marks this 

migration cuts through a well shaped terrace and is not in-filled by magmatic products 

and the disruption itself of the Faial ridge, suggests, that the overall SATJ migration 

might have occurred in a magma-poor environment therefore at the at the onset of the 

MAR normal seafloor spreading, (i.e. ca. 7 Ma according to Gente et al., 2003). 

The gradual migration of the SATJ converges to expectable NATJ position. Probably 

the changing in the kinematic conditions that supported this migration favored the 

rupturing of the Terceira axis as an intra-oceanic rift zone, therefore redefining the 

NATJ trace and plate boundary to a more northerly position along this structure. 

Though the starting age can be tentatively constrained by Gente’s model, the end of 

such process, which resulted in the present definition of the EU/AF plate boundary 

dominantly along the Terceira axis is less easily definable. Probably, Luis et al., 1994 

model where the repositioning of the SATJ is achieved by discrete small ridge jumps to 

its present position, allegedly along the intersection of Faial-Pico strike with the MAR, 

remains valid (also see discussion in Chapter VIII).    

The disparities observed in some sectors of the Azores plateau between main morpho-

tectonic and magnetic anomaly features suggests that its present morphology and most 

 49 



 
Chapter II –Review of the kinematic models for the ATJ and AHS 
 
 
of its magnetic character associated with the Azores trend have been shaped in recent 

times, surely less than 7 Ma, and most probably less than 3 Ma as we shall see later in 

chapters IV and V of this manuscript, when we will analyze in more detail the present 

configuration of the ATJ and the EU/NUB plate boundary. 

II.6 Conclusions 

1) The rotations of a set of point elements within the plateau, inferred from calculated 

EU/AF stage poles, suggest an overall dominance of a transtensional or oblique 

extension regime from at least 33.4 (C13) to the present. From C13 to C6 any of these 

regimes would be dominated by extension along a near N-S direction. From C6 to the 

present extensional direction rotates to a direction closer to WSW-ENE or W-E 

according to the reference kinematical model chosen.  

2) The EAFZ can be approached as the structural homologue of the Pico FZ considering 

NAM/WAF finite rotation poles. Therefore this structure acted as a southern plate 

boundary SATJ for most of the evolution of the Azores plateau since anomaly C13. 

3) The northern trace of rotated Pico FZ Position using NAM/EU finite rotation poles 

(NATJ), does not correspond to any significant morphological feature. This implies that 

either a discrete plate boundary never evolve fully, and that the Azores kinematic block 

constituted an area of essentially distributed deformation, or that if existed this plate 

boundary was mask later by subsequent tectono-magmatic events.  

4) No simple closure of the ATJ is possible at anomaly C13, implying that deformation 

associated with the Azores Triple Junction started prior to the 33.4 Ma. We need 

therefore to evoke an Azores domain with a kinematic behavior independent of the two 

larger plates. The expected position of the AHS implies little to no interaction of the hot 

 50 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
spot with the SATJ existed at this time, and that the onset of Azores domain and 

topography might have been, mainly tectonically controlled these early stages.  

5) Strong interaction of the SATJ with the AHS started probably at C6 times (20 Ma) 

according to the models referred to in this study. After a period of intense melt 

production which reached a maximum at C5, rifting of the Azores plateau began around 

7 Ma.  Between C6 and C5 the EAFZ ceases to work as the SATJ, which departs from 

the EAFZ (in a intra-transform context) northwestwards. The migration process lasted 

to through times earlier than 7 Ma, as the most probable morpho-structure corresponds 

to a valley largely depleted from magmatism, and therefore generated after the 

maximum magmatic activity, AHS related.

Chapter III – Azores Hotspot Influence on MAR Seismicity 

III.1 Hydrophone Arrays 

One of the strategies designed to identify the effects of the AHS is the mapping of 

volcanic and tectonic activity along the MAR.  This can be done very efficiently with 

the use of hydrophone arrays, a technique developed for submarine acoustic surveying 

that is now available for scientific use. In north Atlantic two autonomous hydrophone 

networks have operated in the past. A NSF network was deployed in February 1999 

south of the Azores by NOAA/PMEL between latitudes 17ºN and 35ºN (Smith et al., 

2002 and 2003, Dziak et al., 2004), and was kept under operation until June 2005. The 

northern SIRENA (Goslin et al., 2004) network was setup as a joint France-USA-

Portugal cooperative effort. It operated between latitudes 40° 20' N and 50° 30' N, from 

May 2002 to September 2003. The two networks overlap in time for about 11 months, 

complementing one another therefore providing an earthquake monitoring of the entire 

Northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge axis from 16°N to 50°N during that time span. 

The main objective of the SIRENA array deployment was the long-term monitoring of 

earthquake activity occurring at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge axis. Such observations enable 

an understanding of the spatio-temporal distribution of earthquakes along the MAR both 

in their tectonic segmentation context and in a broader scale as an indication of the 

interactions between the slow spreading MAR and the Azores plume. 

 53 



 
Chapter III – Azores Hotspot Influence on the MAR seismicity 
 
 
The autonomous hydrophones are portable stand alone devices deployed at the water 

column to passively register ocean noise for time spans that can reach 1.5 years. The 

system is programmed to record 1s data at 100 Hz (1 to 40 Hz band pass). The 

hydrophone (Figure III.1) is an instrument with 1.8 meters long and 0.17 m wide 

consisting essentially of four components: the hydrophone itself and, packed within a 

titanium pressure case, a signal pre-amplifier, a battery pack and the data logger. The 

signal is digitized from the device amplifier and resultant data is buffered in the system 

RAM until full. Only then is the data recorded at one of several hard disk drives to 

economize energy. The system shutdowns automatically, after the last disk in the data 

logger is written.

The mooring package is displayed in Figure III.2.A. From seafloor up it consists on an 

anchor attached to an acoustic release (Figure III.2B), in turn linked to the instrument by 

 54 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
a very low stretch mooring line, to minimize hydrostatic noise and pre-measured to 

place it at the correct water depth. The instrument is further attached to a set of floats 

which provide positive flotation to the set once the base anchor is released on bottom.

channel axis (see section 2.2). B) Photograph of bottom anchor and acoustic release on deck. 

 

III.2. The SOFAR channel 

Autonomous hydrophones are deployed in the SOFAR (SOund Fixing And Ranging) 

channel. This ocean water layer is present in all the ocean basins, occurring in the 

Atlantic at depths between 700 and 1000 m. This channel forms at a minimum on a 

vertical sound velocity depth profile, resultant from the interplay between temperature 

and pressure variations with depth. The conjugate effect of sound velocity decrease at 

the thermocline and the sound velocity increase due to pressure below it, generates a 

minimum-velocity channel in which acoustic waves remain trapped (Figure III.3).

it. (http://www.beyonddiscovery.org). Bottom) A measured velocity profile from the Southern 
network displaying hydrophone depth in the water column (Dziak et al., 2004) 

 

The refraction of sound waves from higher velocities above and below the sound 

channel axis bend the sound ray paths back towards the axis. Having no interaction with 

the sea surface nor the sea bottom, the SOFAR channel trapped acoustic phases suffer 

very low signal attenuation, which enables the acoustic waves to travel effectively over 

very long distances (up to several thousand km).  

 56 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 

III.3 T phases 

Seismic waves from tectonic events or volcanic tremors, when crossing the rough sea-

bottom to water interface, convert into acoustic waves called T-phases; T stands for 

“Tertiary” as these waves travel more slowly in water (~1.5 km/s) than seismic waves 

do within the solid Earth, arriving in third after the P and S waves on land seismic 

stations and hydrophones. Hydrophones can only register P and S phases, provided that 

the seismic event is close to the instrument, as seismic phases attenuate rapidly within 

the crust (within 150/200 km for medium magnitude earthquakes). An exception to this 

is the ability for hydrophones to detect by direct incidence of P waves generated at 

distant epicenters from very high energy events. Due to their efficient propagation in the 

SOFAR channel, T-phases can be registered by the autonomous hydrophone, thousands 

of km away from their source area. 

III.4 Data Analysis Interface  

Data recorded in each array instrument is accessed via “Seasick”, a NOAA developed 

data analysis interface. It enables the analyst to display the data from each instrument 

simultaneously on screen as a spectrogram (Figure III.4). In each channel Y axis is time, 

X axis is a frequency interval (from 0 to 140 Hz, but customizable) and a 10% cosine 

tapered amplitude spectrum of the signal record is color coded providing a measure by 

visual inspection of earthquake acoustic magnitude. Time frequency resolution on 

display of each scan line is customizable when justifiable but for a normal configuration 

a time resolution of 4 s has proven to be a good trade off between analyzing a large 

amount of data and getting accurate reduce errors in locations. Data is scrolled either 

synchronized in time or at each channel time and the operator checks by visual 

inspection for signals over the background ocean noise.  

 57

Figure III.4 - Screen capture of the interface from the program developed at NOAA, used to 
process the hydrophone data. In this example 4 hydrophones from SIRENA are displayed, along 
with the software main command window. 

 

Picking earthquake signals is a simple but sometimes not straightforward task. The 

operator first performs a rough pick of the specific earthquake signal in each channel, 

and re-displays the histogram at a higher frequency resolution. By using criteria, 

normally based on the scan lines which present the smallest frequencies with higher 

amplitudes within the coda for that earthquake, a refined recalculation provides a more 

accurate prediction of position. This process is iteratively performed until the picking 

procedure allows minimization of the errors. When picked successfully, the calculated 

time, position, acoustic magnitude, and errors for this parameters as well as the number 

 58 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
of hydrophones used in the localization of the event are than stored on a posit files for 

posterior seismicity studies. ThePosit files from several arrays around the world are 

made available on the NOAA website for download 

(http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/vents/acoustics/seismicity/seismicity.html). 

The detailed description of the mathematical methods built-in on the program to provide 

T-phase source location and error estimates is out of scope of this work. Detailed 

information on this issue can be found in Fox et al. (2001).  Here we just summarize the 

procedure briefly.  Using built-in models of ocean sound propagation velocities, sound 

is propagated from a preliminary location to the hydrophones using interactively a non 

linear least square inversion method. Successive runs then, minimize the differences 

between predicted and recorded arrival times. Several solutions are calculated on each 

run to check consistency of initial source location; these consider the source location 

falling within the center of the array, outside the array from the direction of the 

hydrophone which registered the first arrival, and at the minimum residual error from a 

coarser grid. The location is taken from the solution presenting the lowest root mean 

square (RMS) residual error.    

III.5 The SIRENA experiment  

The SIRENA Project was set up in 2000, as a result of a cooperative agreement between 

UMR6538/CNRS (Brest, France; PI J. Goslin), the “Géosciences Marines Lab” from 

IPG Paris, the PMEL/NOAA (Pacific Marine Environmental Lab, Newport, OR, USA), 

the CGUL (Lisbon University Geophysical Center) and the CIMA (Marine and 

Environmental Research Center, University of Algarve – Portugal).   

 59 



 
Chapter III – Azores Hotspot Influence on the MAR seismicity 
 
 
Two cruises have occurred within the framework of this project (Figure III.5): 

SIRENA1-2002 cruise aboard the R/V Le Suroit, starting in Ponta Delgada (Açores) on 

May, 16th and docking in Brest on June, 4th, 2002. Six hydrophones were successfully 

deployed during SIRENA1 on both flanks of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between 

Kurtchatov Fracture Zone, immediately north of the Azores Plateau and a major 

discontinuity south of the Charlie Gibbs Fracture Zone (between 40º20’N and 50º35’N). 

(see report at http:// www-sdt.univ-brest.fr/ ~goslin/SIRENA/REPT). 

A multi-beam survey of the ridge axis between latitudes 48°20’N and 50°05’N was 

completed. Together with previous surveys, in particular TRIATNORD (Goslin et al, 

1999), these data provides complete bathymetry coverage from 40°20’N to 51°55’N 

(with the exception of the section between 46°N and 48°20’N, where only a few single-

beam and multi-beam tracks cross the MAR).  

The hydrophone array was recovered during the SIRENA II/D274 cruise, sailed by RRS 

Discovery from Govan, Scotland (Sept, 12th, 2003) to Ponta Delgada (Oct, 1st, 2003). Of 

the six hydrophones deployed in May 2002 (see site locations on Figure III.5), only five 

were recovered during SIRENA2/D274. We were not able to recover S3. Hydrophones 

S1, S2, S4 and S5 recorded data during the entire time they were deployed.  S6 stopped 

recording data on the 12th day after its deployment. Despite this drawback, the four 

operational hydrophones occupy the four corner sites of the array and data analysis 

indicates they provide accurate locations of earthquakes that occurred within the array.

III.6 SIRENA data processing 

The hydrophone acoustic data analysis started in Brest in early November 2003. During 

that initial time we concentrated on acoustic data recorded within periods during which 

events were detected along the northern MAR by global seismic networks and listed in 

the USGS earthquake data catalog. Such an approach allowed for a first-order estimate 

of the performance of the hydrophone network and provided new results on the seismic 

activity of the MAR and on the Reykjanes ridge (Goslin et al., 2004) 

 61 



 
Chapter III – Azores Hotspot Influence on the MAR seismicity 
 
 
In general, even reduced to 4 instruments, the SIRENA array was able to detect and 

locate earthquakes from as far south as the Sierra Leone Fracture Zone (around 7°N) 

and as far north as the the Reykjanes Ridge (62ºN) . The Sirena hydrophone array has 

also observed seismic phases generated by distant earthquakes which have traveled 

through the lower mantle and core (Figure III.6). While hydrophones are capable of 

recording acoustic signals originating from thousands of miles away, the presence of the 

shallow and extensive Azores Plateau disrupts the SOFAR channel and acts as a natural 

barrier to sound propagation. Therefore this limits the ability of SIRENA network to 

detect many of the events occurring along the MAR axis in the opposite sections of the 

MAR with regard to the Azores Plateau and increases the location error of the 

earthquakes that are detected.   

Mainly due to blocking effect of the Azores Plateau, we verified that a large number of 

events was recorded by only three hydrophones (S2, S4 and S5 see Figure III.7). 

Numerous events have large location errors and plotted in an abnormal off-axis region 

around 33ºW, 44ºN.  

In order to get more constrained locations of these events, the SIRENA network data 

has been re-processed together with the “NSF array” deployed south of the Azores, 

during the common period of operation of both networks which extends from May 2002 

(deployment of the SIRENA network) to April 2003 (last servicing of the South Azores 

network).  

An evaluation of seismic events located with both networks suggests that this 

processing strategy has significantly improved the location of the events which occurred 

between latitudes 35°N and 41°N (the area between the two networks).

III.7 Comparison between hydro-acoustic and global seismological network data 

Along the MAR 2973 earthquakes were localized between latitudes 10°N and 66°N 

from June, 1st, 2002 to 1st March, 2003 (Figure III.8). During the same period, land-

based networks localised 98 events along the same section of the MAR (as listed in the 

NEIC catalog). The hydrophone arrays thus recorded and localized close to 30 times as 

many earthquakes as the land-based networks, thus exemplifying the large difference in 

detection threshold between autonomous hydrophones and land-based stations (Dziak et 

al., 2004). Previous work along the 15°-35° N section of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge has 

shown that using autonomous hydrophones to detect earthquakes can lower the 

detection threshold of events from the 4.6 mb of global seismic networks to 3.0 mb 

(Dziak et al., 2004), leading to a twenty-fold increase in the number of events detected. 

The data now processed jointly, confirms this. The hydrophone array succeeded in 

detecting - and precisely locating - about thirty more MAR events than the global 

seismological networks over the same time period. As an example, 66 small-magnitude 

earthquakes were detected and localized near 48°N, 27°W, while the global networks 

only observed a single event (with a magnitude mb =4.6). Since these earthquakes are 

located within the hydrophone network, their location error is less than a few kilometers 

in latitude and longitude. 

III.8 Large wavelength variation in seismicity patterns with latitude  

The spatial distribution of the seismicity rate vs. latitude shows a remarkable first-order 

long-wavelength pattern: 1) the seismicity rate is low when approaching the Azores and 

Iceland (reaching values as low as 10 events/d°), while it peaks to 70 events/d° in the 

vicinity of the Gibbs FZ (Figure III.9a). 2) moreover, the latitudinal distribution of the 

seismicity  hints  at  an  asymmetric  influence  of  the  Azores  hotpot on the MAR: 720   

 65

 66 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
events have been localized inside the SIRENA array (between latitudes 40°20'N and 

50°30'N), while 453 earthquakes have occurred south of the Azores, along a section of 

the MAR of similar latitudinal extent (28°N &gt; 38°N). 

The spatial distribution of the seismicity rates (Figure III.9a) along the MAR anti-

correlates well, at long wavelengths, with the zero-age depths (Figure III.9c). These 

correlations fit in well with the now classical image of a hotspot-influenced slow 

spreading centre: globally thicker and more ductile crust would be emplaced along ridge 

segments closer to the hotspot, while the thinner, colder and more brittle crust emplaced 

along ridge sections free from the hotspot influence would produce a higher seismicity. 

Finally, the along-ridge seismicity distribution correlates with the Vs velocity anomalies 

at 100 km in the upper mantle (Figure III.9b). It is thus proposed that the thermal regime 

of the upper mantle, as it results in variations of the rheology and thickness of the crust, 

would be an important factor   controlling the spatial distribution of the seismicty. The 

later could then be used as an additional tool to characterize the along-ridge 

asymmetrical influence of the Azores and Iceland hotspots on the MAR slow-spreading 

center, as it was proposed by Goslin et al. (1999). Our study thus confirms the 

asymmetry which was inferred earlier from global studies (e.g. Goslin et al., 1998; 

1999). 

III.9 Time-wise seismicity distributions along the MAR 

Similarly to what was observed for the spatial distribution of the seismicity along the 

Ridge, and even if a ten-month period cannot be considered as fully representative, 

time-wise distributions of the seismicity along the MAR (Figure III.10) show very 

different behaviours: 1) some sections of the MAR, which are considered as undergoing 

little influenced by the Azores hotspot (e.g. the 46°-49°N section) are the loci of more

observed along other sections (such as the 36°N-39°N section, centred on the Lucky 

Strike segment, along which only 36 events occurred during the same period) appears 

interrupted by long quiescent spells.

III.10 Discussion and Conclusions 

Long-term monitoring of the seismicity along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge by two networks 

of autonomous hydrophones allowed the characterization of the spatial and temporal 

distributions of the seismicity along a 55º -degree-long section of the MAR.  These 

 69 



 
Chapter III – Azores Hotspot Influence on the MAR seismicity 
 
 
distributions bring new insights both on ridge/hotspot interactions and on accretion 

processes along a hotspot-influenced spreading center.  

At long wavelengths, along-ridge seismicity rates appear closely correlated with other 

observables which characterize the thermal regime of the crust and upper mantle. These 

spatial correlations seem to confirm that the strong influence exerted on the MAR by the 

Azores plume extends over a long distance to the South and that its extension is more 

limited to the north of the hotspot.  

At the ridge segment scale, time-wise epicentre distributions show that two different 

modes can be observed in the MAR seismicity: A high and constant seismicity rate 

would result from dominantly tectonic processes characterize colder sections of the 

Ridge. Conversely, a more episodic low-rate seismicity, which would be due to 

magmatic processes is observed near the centers of globally hotter - because they are 

located closer to the Azores hotspot?- segments. 

It is however important to recall that the Azores plateau interrupts the SOFAR channel 

therefore inhibiting the accurate detection of hydro-accoustic events from the Azores 

plateau. This might lead to a biased analysis when transported to the Azores Plateau 

context. In the Azores, earthquake activity registered by local and global land based 

seismological networks, (as we shall address in the next chapter) is abundant in the 

some of the regions within the plateau, noticeably along the Terceira axis, as a result of 

tectonic and volcanic activity.  In the Azores the thermal structure and consequently the 

lithosphere thickness along the Terceira axis are almost certainly quite different from 

those of the MAR north and south of the Azores, and probably progressively thicker 

 70

towards the Gloria fault (Bier, 2005), therefore favoring the onset of seismicity due to 

increase in thickness of brittle sections of the lithosphere.

Chapter IV - Defining the present day EU-NUB plate boundary  

IV.1 Introduction 

The determination of the Terceira axis segmentation pattern, the location of actively 

spreading segments and discontinuities, the areal extent of the plate boundary itself, are 

not easily definable. Poor definition of the plate boundary location arises probably from 

the combination of factors like the extremely reduced spreading rate promoting an 

unstructured pattern of magnetic anomalies or the highly discontinuous nature of 

accretion, and the complex tectonic pattern. For example, it remains unclear, due to 

absence of clear  age relations which structures within the Terceira axis are actively 

deforming, and if accretion is taking place in the topographical highs or lows, in the 

submarine areas.  

The beginning of GPS observation in the Azores with the installation in 1998 of the 

TANGO (Trans-Atlantic Network for Geodynamics and Oceanography) project (Bastos 

et al., 1998) has enabled to study from the geodetic point of view the present day 

displacement field associated with the Azores Triple Junction. 

In this chapter we review the models presented by different authors addressing the 

tectonic pattern of the EU-NUB plate boundary in the present day. We summarize the 

main seismo-tectonic observations and discuss new geodetic data presented by 

Fernandes et al. (2006). We first examine segmentation geometry by comparing the 

 73 



 
Chapter IV – Defining the present day EU-NUB plate boundary 
 
 
observed displacement field with the predictions from two plate tectonic model based 

on geodetic data: DEOS2k (Fernandes et al., 2003) and NUVEL-1A model (DeMets et 

al., 1994). Finally, the observed relative velocity field is used to test a half-space elastic 

dislocation model for a synthetic plate boundary configuration. The results derived from 

this model are used to deduce the geometry of the present-day plate boundary and the 

width of the actively inter-plate region.  

IV.2 Models based on morpho-tectonic and seismo-tectonic analysis  

Based on sonar GLORIA images interpretations, Searle (1980) has presented a tentative 

segmentation pattern for this spreading center (Figure IV.1).  This author considered 

that the present day position of the ATJ was located at the intersection of the North 

Azores Fracture Zone with the Terceira axis.

Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
Recent improvements on the quality of the baseline data, namely on the regional 

bathymetric coverage (Lourenço et al., 1998, Gente et al., 2003) along with detailed 

tectonic work performed at Pico, Faial and S. Jorge Islands from the Central group 

(Madeira and Ribeiro, 1990) has led to models addresing the present day tectonic 

regime of the ATJ and the stress pattern within the Eurasian-African plate boundary.  

Early views on the Terceira Axis as a simple rift system were considerably affected by a 

major earthquake event (magnitude 7.2) that took place the 1st Jannuary 1980 west of 

Terceira Island. (Hirn et al., 1980). Contrary to what should be expectable, that is 

extension or oblique extension along normal faults parallel to the N120º strike of the 

Terceira axis, the aftershock sequence of this event was well constrained along a left 

lateral N150º pure strike slip fault (Hirn  et al., 1980) thus inconsistent with a simple 

spreading geometry. Madeira and Ribeiro (1990), considering the mapped fault families 

along the N150º and N120º, both displaying kinematic criteria ranging from dip slip to 

oblique slip faults to pure strike slip faults respectively as left lateral and right lateral, 

suggested that the tectonic regime was transtensional with a right lateral component and 

located the plate boundary at the S. Jorge channel (Figure IV.2).  

A similar stress pattern, but a considerably different plate boundary configuration was 

proposed by Lourenço et al. (1998) using the fissural systems, represented by the linear 

volcanic ridges, as kinematic indicators (Figure IV.3). These authors, considering the 

marked rotation observed in these ridges within the plateau, their strike sub-parallel to 

the Terceira axis, the areal scatter of the earthquake activity within the western sector of 

the Azores plateau, and the prevalence of the Azores trend between 38º30’ (West of the 

Condor Ridge)  and  the  North  Azores  Fracture  Zone, considered  the  ATJ,  from the

tectonic point of view, as a distributed feature.  They also observed the right lateral 

transtensional character of the Azores domain which is interpreted as simultaneously 

acting as an ultra-slow spreading centre at the Terceira axis and a transfer zone which 

accommodates the dextral differential movement between stables Eurasian and African 

plates. 

Miranda et al., (1998) considering the earthquake distribution from local seismic 

network, data form a passive OBS survey and the focal mechanisms from Azores 

events, also inferred a transtensional regime from the tectonic fault system, where EU-

AF inter-plate right lateral shear would be partitioned between the two fault systems in a 

framework of a tectonic block model (Figure IV.4). According to these authors, the 

interplay between the two faulting directions defines the current morpho-structure of the 

Terceira axis, where the basins are considered to coincide with tectonic blocks. The 

shear deformation along the plate boundary would be accommodated by rotation of the 

different fault controlled tectonic blocks. 

More recently, Vogt and Jung (2003) returned to early views which approached 

Terceira axis as a classical rift system. They classified the Terceira axis as a young (&amp;lt;1 

Ma) intra-oceanic oblique spreading rift system. Noticing the extremely low spreading 

rates between EU and NUB predicted by NUVEL1A, and by comparing the first order 

morphological structures of the Terceira axis with other ultra-slow and super-slow ridge 

systems such as the Garkel, The Mohns- Knipovitch or the SWIR ridge systems, they 

conclude that the Terceira axis (designated by these authors as Terceira rift) is the 

slowest spreading environment in the world ridge system.

In their view the plate boundary is located solely along the Terceira axis and, 

analogously to Searle’s interpretation they locate the ATJ at the intersection of the 

Terceira axis with the MAR along the N. Azores Fracture Zone. Their interpretation of 

 78 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
Terceira axis as an oblique rift zone excludes the block tectonic model presented by 

Miranda et al. (1998)  as Terceira axis basins are considered to correspond merely to 

segments of the rift valley which were not filled with volcanism. 

Volcano-tectonic activity on the inner sectors of the plateau south of the Terceira axis is 

disregarded by these authors as significant and part of the plate boundary zone 

processes. Rather they consider that these structures are linked to and are a result of ATJ 

past northward migrating history in close link to the AHS migration northwards. They 

interpret their growth as a result of magmatism remnant of HS activity under short-lived 

presently abandoned rift axes. These interpretations and the significance of the linear 

volcanic ridges as a part of the actual plate boundary processes will be discussed more 

thoroughly in the next chapter. 

IV.3 Earthquake data 

IV.3.1 Epicenter spatial distributions 

The Azores plateau displays quite a high level of seismicity but of low magnitude. The 

epicentral locations shown in Figure IV.5 comprise the time span between 1994 and 

2004, and are taken from the ISC (“international Seismological Catalogue”). We opted 

to disregard epicenters from previous dates because 1994 was the year were the local 

based SIVISA network entered in operation and corresponds to a better azimuthal 

coverage and better constrained epicenter locations. Nevertheless, the period chosen 

covers the time span of GPS TANGO network observations and provides a good 

reference on how active processes distribute across the plateau. 

The seismicity displays some amount of scattering but is largely aligned along the 

Terceira Axis in a band ca. 80 km wide for its central and eastern part., essentially 

 79 



 
Chapter IV – Defining the present day EU-NUB plate boundary 
 
 
confined within its northern and southern walls. In the western sector the band of 

seismicity widens to about 180 km, and is limited to the south by Condor volcanic ridge  

and the northen wall of Terceira axis between Terceira and Western Graciosa basin. 

 It is worth noting that the majority of epicenters are located on submarine areas. The 

Islands generally display few occurrences. Islands such as Pico, S. Jorge, Graciosa, 

Terceira and S. Maria are earthquake depleted. Exceptions to this scenario are S. Miguel 

and Faial Islands. In the case of Faial, the earthquake cluster located NE of the Island 

corresponds to main shock and aftershock sequences resulting from the 1999 destructive 

earthquake that struck the Island, with epicenter NE of the Island (See section IV.4). 

The earthquake activity in S, Miguel is of low magnitude swarm like type and is 

probably related with volcanic activity at two volcanic systems within the Island, The 

Sete cidades caldera on the NW tip of the Island and the Fogo Caldera a volcano located 

near the center of the Island within the NW-SE trending Congro graben. Both systems 

have been displaying signs of activity in recent times.  

Other spatial clusters of activity along time are mainly focused, despite the scatter, 

seawards west of volcanic ridges: Condor, Pico-Faial S. Jorge and within Terceira axis: 

West Graciosa Basin and at the SE Terceira ridge between D. João de Castro bank and 

Terceira Island  

IV.3.2 Focal Mechanisms at the Azores 

There are limited moment centroid solutions available at the Azores. These are 

presented in Figure IV.5 following Harvard CMT convention. The vast majority of the 

solutions are of low magnitude pure normal faulting events or with a minor component 

of right lateral strike slip along N120º planes (Grimison and Chen, 1986; Bufforn et al,. 

 80 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
1988). These events present normally traction T axes directions nearly perpendicular to 

the Terceira axis at each location. This progressive rotation of tectonic directions from 

WNW-ESE to nearly N-S at the intersection of the Terceira axis with the Gloria fault 

was already recognized by Luis (1996) and Lourenço et al., (1998).  

Two thrust events are documented in the Azores region. One is located north of the D. J. 

Castro bank and was re-evaluated by Buforn et al. (1988) as a dominantly right lateral 

strike slip event along a nearly East-West direction or conversely a left lateral strike slip 

along a N-S fault plane. Another thrust event is located SE of S. Miguel near the 

formigas islets. Its significance remains unclear, but might be related with structural 

complexities at the intersection between the Terceira axis and the Gloria fault. 

The highest magnitude events registered instrumentally that have occurred in the Azores 

are of pure left lateral strike slip faulting along directions ranging NW-SE to N-S. This 

faulting direction was first interpreted by analysis of aftershock epicenter distributions 

(Hirn et al., 1980) following the highly destructive M = 7.2, Terceira, 1st Jannuray 1980 

earthquake with epicenter at the Eastern Graciosa Basin.  

IV.4 The Faial 1998 earthquake  

This earthquake occurred on July 9th 1998, with epicenter at the sea 10 km NE of Faial 

at a SIVISA computed location of 38º38.05’N  28º31.38’ W (Senos et al., 1998).  This 

event had a Mw = 6.1 and caused 8 casualties and 1500 homeless. Figure IV.5 displays 

the focal mechanism for this event. Two conjugate planes determined are: Strike N61º 

dip 82º and rake -180º and strike 151º, dip 90º, rake -8º.  

Soon after the main shock, the seismological network was up-graded and documented 

with very detail the aftershock sequence  that followed,  registering  thousands  of small

magnitude events (Dias, 2006). The resulting epicenter distribution pattern displays a 

major alignment along the N151º direction but is cut trough by epicenter alignments 

which follow the other conjugate nodal plane direction. Fernandes et al. (2002) using 

GPS data from the TANGO network, isolated the co-seismic displacement  component 

and modeled the dislocations provided by the two possible fault solutions in an 

homogeneous elastic half-space. Results from their modeling procedure did not provide 

any additional tectonic constraints, as both fault solutions provided equally satisfactory 

fits to the observations.   

More recently, Dias (2006) performed a complete re-evaluation of the earthquake 

sequence following the main shock and aftershock epicenters have been re-located and 

focal mechanisms resultant from that event have been revised and up-graded from 

previous publications on the subject. Considering the aftershocks epicentral distribution, 

they cluster in two nearly ortogonal tectonic directions following the main shock 

rupture. Focal mechanisms display a complex pattern, and in any case, both possible 

fault planes are clearly discordant from the orientation of Faial Island main faults 

(Figure IV.6). Ruptures in the N60º direction, are dominantly oblique right lateral 

normal faulting events. On the contrary focal mechanism distributed along the N160-

N170º vary between dip slip normal events and others which display a marked left 

lateral strike slip component. The significance of these strike slip events, for the 

tectonics of the present day tectonics of the Triple Junction will be dealt with in chapter 

VIII.

IV.5 Geodetic Data 

IV.5.1 The TANGO experiment 

The initial TANGO network consisted of one station per Island (cf. Figure IV.7) and 

was re-occupied with an approximate triennial periodicity until 1997. In 1999, DEOS 

 84 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
(Department of Earth Observation and Satellite systems) and AOUP (Astronomical 

Observatory of University of Porto) initiated a collaboration with the aim of maintaining 

and expanding the original network. In September-October 1999, 26 new sites were 

observed for the first time on the Central Group of the Azores Archipelago. In addition, 

two permanent GPS stations were installed on Faial (2000) and Terceira (2001). In 

2001, CGUL (University of Lisbon Geophysical Center), in collaboration with DEOS 

and AOUP, added 30 new GPS stations in Terceira (May 2001, see Navarro et al., 

2003) and Faial and Pico (October 2001) Islands. These stations are being observed 

every year to address the intra-Island displacement field over the Central Group. Figure 

IV.7 presents the actual GPS network in the Central Group of the Azores Archipelago. 

This will be referred to here as the Extended TANGO network. 

Results from the initial TANGO network for the period 1988-1997 were already 

presented by Bastos et al. (1998). A new evaluation of the TANGO network for the 

1993-2000 period was presented by Fernandes et al. (2004). The 1988 and 1991 

TANGO campaigns were not considered due to their low quality. The average opening 

rate of the Middle Atlantic Ridge at the latitude of Graciosa/Corvo Islands was re-

evaluated as 23 mm/yr, consistent with global kinematic models, such as NUVEL-1A 

(DeMets et al., 1994), and with local studies based on marine magnetic anomalies (Luis, 

1996).  

IV.5.2 GPS Results 

The processing schemes for data used in this chapter are detailed in Fernandes et al., 

2006. They use daily solutions from each campaign and combine them into a single 

campaign solution. Table IV.1 lists the overall r.m.s. of the residuals for the reference 

stations used in each campaign. The overall residuals in all campaigns range between 1 

 85

mm and 3 mm in the horizontal components and, between 4 mm and 8 mm in the 

vertical component. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure IV.7 - GPS sites in the Azores Archipelago observed since 1988 (the Central Group is 
evidenced due to the large number of stations recently installed). Gray lines show the location of the 
segments used in the elastic modeling procedure). 

 

A procedure was then followed to retrieve the velocity solutions relative to a geodetic 

reference model, the ITRF (International Terrestrial Reference Frame) 2000 (Altamimi 

et al., 2002). This model defines a set of coordinates and velocities for a series of 

fiducial points on the Earth surface therefore providing a frame to which the velocity 

solutions for each campaign can be compared.

The velocities relative to ITRF2000 of the six stations in the Central and Eastern groups 

of the Azores - that correspond to the longest observation periods - are plotted in Figure 

IV.8. In the same Figure, velocities computed from kinematic plate models, assuming 

stable Nubia or stable Eurasia behaviors are also plotted relative to ITRF2000. This is 

done for DEOS2k (Fernandes et al., 2003), NUVEL-1A (DeMets et al.,1994) and 

REVEL (Sella et al., 2002) models. 

The time-series for Faial station (FAIM) is not shown. As discussed by Fernandes et al. 

(2002), there is a sudden slope change between the 1997 and the 1999 observations due 

to the co-seismic elastic deformation associated with the 1998.08.09 Faial earthquake. 

Therefore, due to the short time-span after the earthquake, the FAIM site is disregarded 

in our analysis.  

 87 



 
Chapter IV – Defining the present day EU-NUB plate boundary 
 
 
Concerning the Island of Santa Maria, the available time series matches well with stable 

“Nubian” behavior. The other "end-member" of the displacement field corresponds to 

the Island of Graciosa: the available time series matches well the predicted "Eurasian" 

behavior. This observation (like the previous one) does not depend on the choice of the 

global plate kinematic model (cf. Figure IV.8). 

All other stations display an intermediate behavior that can be seen as a weighted 

average between pure Eurasian and pure Nubian behavior. Even Terceira, which is close 

to the northern border of the Azores plateau, displays this intermediate behavior. If the 

Pico and S. Jorge stations are compared, they show similar motions. Therefore, most of 

the relative divergent movement must be accommodated between S. Jorge and Graciosa 

Island. Nevertheless, it is clear for this analysis that inter-plate displacements as 

measured from GPS are not confined to the Terceira axis. 

IV.5.3 Half space Elastic dislocation modeling  

The observed displacement field for the Azores Islands may be due to both elastic and 

inelastic processes. The viability of a purely elastic model with slip on buried 

dislocations (considered as the active plate boundary) can be investigated, if an a-priori 

location of the boundary is available. The most diagnostic information to locate the 

active spreading area comes from magnetic anomalies. Luis (1996) made a large-scale 

aeromagnetic survey that allowed the identification of a series of magnetic highs, 

following the alignment of the Islands that was interpreted as neo-volcanic axes. The 

segmentation pattern deduced from magnetic data is represented in Figure IV.7.

 89 



 
Chapter IV – Defining the present day EU-NUB plate boundary 
 
 
Here we tested two segmentation patterns: one where the plate boundary consists of 6 

segments which follow the Terceira axis and intersect the Mid-Atlantic Ridge near the 

North Azores Fracture zone corresponding to the segmentation models proposed by 

Searle (1980) and corroborated by Vogt and Jung (2003) referred to hereafter as one 

axis model, and one that considers a Triple Junction further south following the 

westward prolongation of Faial-Pico direction towards the Mid-Atlantic Ridge 

corresponding to the segmentation pattern solution proposed by Luis et al., 1996, based 

on magnetic anomalies and kinematic premises (Table IV.2), this will be referred to as 

the two axis model.  

The elastic models were computed using the half-space approach (Okada, 1985). Each 

rids (the inter-plate displacements) from the elastic model 

domain) the displacement is maximum for the given plate boundary configuration and 

boundary segment has rectangular shape; its top follows the magnetic lineation and is 

located at the locking depth of 8 km. This depth defines the base of lithosphere 

deforming elastically due to continuous inelastic inter-plate strain below. The slip vector 

for each fault is determined from the projection of the DEOS2k and NUVEL1A relative 

velocity models between NUB and EU plates at the segment centre considering a fixed 

Eurasian Plate (Table IV.2). 

The predicted displacement g

are referenced to the segments used in the modeling procedure. These are subsequently 

converted into a tectonic plate reference frame. The Nubia displacement field with 

relation to a fixed Eurasian plate, predicted with Nuvel1A or Deos2K, is calculated and 

subtracted from the model grids. The resulting grid (see Figures IV.9 and IV.10) 

presents the interplate expectable deformation zone  between stable Eurasia (where the 

displacement is overall null) and stable African plate where beyond the inter plate

and values for displacement components are compared with TANGO observations (See

The predictions from the dislocation model are shown in Figures IV.9 and IV.10. A zero 

slip had to be affected to the candidate boundary segments 5 and 6 (cf. Figure IV.7). 

This is a direct consequence of the fact, already noted, that GRAC station displays an 

almost pure Eurasian behavior (cf. Figures IV.8). Therefore, only the segment 7 can be 

considered active during the time-span of the TANGO network.

Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 

IV.6 Azores plate boundary configuration by geodesical constraints 

he spatial distribution of the deformation associated with the Eurasia-Nubia plate 

oundary remains poorly understood. The divergence between the two mega-plates 

and the Pico-Faial lineaments, along which the high-amplitude 

ctive plate boundary area is still unclear, and one of the main objectives of this work 

was to get information from the GPS velocity field distribution to better understand its 

road structure. 

ons (Graciosa and S. Maria) display a clear 

inematic behavior, with a displacement that follows respectively the Eurasian and 

Nubian velocity vectors retrieved from DEOS2k. This result is consistent with the fact 

that no significant active tectonic active structures are known north of Graciosa or south 

f Santa Maria (Lourenço et al., 1998). Moreover, Santa Maria lacks any documented 

neo-tectonic activity. In the case of Graciosa, we must still keep in mind that there is 

historical volcanic and seismic activity locally. Thus, even if the behavior concerning 

e last decade matches "pure Eurasia" and even if most of the present day Eurasia-

ubia divergence in this sector of the boundary is accommodated further south, it still 

lies on an active deformation area. This seems to corroborate, at least from the geodetic 

oint of view, the model of broad segmentation proposed by Luis et al. (1998). 

 should be emphasized that a time-scale problem exists in comparing current day plate 

oundary configuration from GPS measurements with that deduced from plate tectonic 

models that integrate the past 3 Myr (DeMets et al., 1994). The short time-span covered 

by the TANGO measurements implies that interpretations can be highly susceptible to

longer term changes in the strain pattern. In this regard, many factors, such as fault 

 to Eurasian velocities at north) is mainly restricted 

Vogt and Jung (2003) suggested that the Terceira Rift is the world's slowest spreading-

axis plate boundary. The Azores Plateau would have been formed by successive NE 

jumps of the oblique spreading axis, where the present Terceira Rift is the latest stage. 

These authors also suggest that the Azores Triple Point is located in the prolongation of 

stress locking during inter-seismic periods, co-seismic induced deformation and swarm 

activity, not necessarily associated with expressed volcanic phenomena, can all be 

accounted for as transtensive strain, and thus condition the configuration and mechanics 

of the inter-plate deformation zone. 

From Figure IV.11, which shows both the main topographic features along the Azores 

plateau together with the mean velocities deduced from the GPS array, it can be seen 

that most of the deformation (that appears in the GPS mean velocities as a change 

between Nubian velocities at south

to the highly tectonized area that includes the Islands themselves, as well as the 

neighboring submarine topographic highs.  

The presented preliminary results (mean velocities) concerning the Extended-TANGO 

network show consistency with the motions deduced from the longer time-series. Table 

IV.4 lists the weighted averaged of the motions for each Island considering all observed 

stations (the associated uncertainty is the weighted r.m.s. of the residuals). Due to large 

uncertainties, the differences observed to date cannot, at present, be interpreted in terms 

of intra-Island tectonics. Further observations are needed to detect the interaction 

between intra- and inter-Island tectonics.

Chapter V - LVR as active tectono-magmatic features of the EU-NUB 
plate boundary 

V.1 Introduction 

As seen in the previous chapter, GPS velocity solutions and forward elastic modeling 

favor, from the geodetic point of view, an interpretation consisting in a plate boundary 

divided in two broad segments: one defining the ATJ configuration exclusively centered 

at the Faial-Pico, and another axis located from Terceira southeastwards along the 

Terceira axis towards the Gloria Fault. This is valid taking both DEOS2K and 

NUVEL1A kinematic models as reference.  

However, the short time span in geodetic observations only provides a snapshot of 

present day kinematic context. The existence of seismo-tectonic and volcanic activity 

along the westernmost sectors of the Terceira axis, implies that geologically the plate 

boundary is not confined to MAR-Faial-Pico segment and if both segments coexist in 

time, some active transfer zone is bound to exist between this two overlapping axis. 

The area enclosed in between these two axis is characterized by a series of sub-parallel 

linear volcanic ridges (Lourenço et al., 1998) (see Figures V.1 and V.2), dividing flat 

terraces with a uniform depth of 1200 m bsl.  This domain encompasses the S. Jorge 

Island, The Faial-Pico itself and two co-planar linear volcanic ridges designated by 

“Condor Mar” and “Condor Terra”, It will be referred to hereafter as the LVR Sector 1. 

 101 



 

Chapter V - LVR as active tectono-magmatic features of the EU-NUB plate boundary 
 
 
These ridges have a characteristic spacing of 30 to 40 km and a uniform axial 

orientation of N120º.  

 

Figure V.1 - Shaded bathymetry of LVR sector 1 and 2. EPVR – East of Pico Volcanic Ridge; 
ETVR – East of Terceira Volcnaic Ridge; SETVR  Southeast of Terceira Volcanic Ridge; STVR – 
South of Terceira Volcanic Ridge. Continuous lines and P1 to P4 denote bathymetric/topographic 
profiles displayed in Figure V.2.  

 

Further East, a second set sub parallel volcanic ridges (Sector 2) is observed. It 

comprises the East Pico Volcanic Ridge (EPVR) the South Terceira Volcanic Ridge 

(STVR) and a undesignated volcanic ridge further SW.  When compared to sector 1, the 

LVR present a similar spacing (about ca. 30 km ) and a marked rotated axial orientation 

(N140º). The EPVR is the submarine prolongation of the Pico Island south-eastwards, 

the STVR on the contrary does not have any correspondence to LVR sector 1 structures. 

The flat terraces separating these LVR are 500 m deeper than those of sector 1. They lie

at a depth of ca. 1700 m bsl and become 200 m shallower between the EPVR and the

Chapter V - LVR as active tectono-magmatic features of the EU-NUB plate boundary 
 
 
It is unclear if LVR Structures present in Sector 2 are apart of the Transfer zone as 

suggested by Lourenço (1998), or if they correspond to already inactive structures 

linked to the past evolution of the Plateau.  

In this chapter we make used of previously published magnetic data, and sonar TOBI 

images acquired during the Azzorre 99 cruise, to study the structure and geological 

nature of the Azores plateau seafloor in both sectors. Given the uncertainty in the 

relative ages of the structures (as previously discussed in Chapter II), we foccus analysis 

in characterizing structures which prove either from magnetic anomalies or by 

neotectonic indicators to be currently active.   

Our goal is three folded: 1) to characterize the seaflor geology of the different volcanic 

ridges. 2) To verify if any qualitative age progression exists amongst them in each 

individual sector and between adjacent sectors. 3) To evaluate the tectono-magmatic 

nature of the plate boundary processes and the dynamics of the transfer zone. 

V.2 Data 

V.2.1 Marine Magnetic data 

To evaluate more thoroughly the nature of the seafloor, especially in what concerns 

distribution of recent volcanism within the Azores Plateau, and to validate geological 

interpretations of the sonar images, we produced a new magnetic map which 

complements that of Luis, 1996 presented in chapter II (cf. Figure II.6). 

This new map has the advantage of the magnetometer being closer to the source 

magnetic layer as it results exclusively from marine magnetic observations and has 

therefore a higher resolution more suitable to complement finer scale TOBI sonar 

images interpretations. This map integrates new data retrieved from the AZZORRE99

cruise and both SIRENA magnetic surveys performed east (Sirena I and II) and west 

(Sirena II) of Terceira Island. These data set was complemented with other magnetic 

data retrieved from the NGDC marine data base (Figure V.32). The resulting magnetic 

anomaly map reduced to the pole is presented in Figure V.4

The Azzore 99 cruise (Ligi et al., 1999) was held in July 1999 on board of the R/V 

Urania (CNR), as a joint Italian (IGM; PI Marco Ligi) – English (Oxford Univ.; PI Neil 

Mitchell); (SOC; TOBI Team) - Portuguese (Lisbon Univ.; Algarve Univ.). TOBI 

operations at sea were financed by the EU under the EASSS program (European Access 

to Sea Floor Survey System), ship time was funded by the Italian CNR. Post cruise data 

processing and training for cruise participants at the SOC –England was also financed 

by the EU.

The cruise surveyed the linear volcanic ridges in the Azores..  It consisted of two legs 

with a stop at Faial Island for partial crew turn-over. The first leg allowed 10 days of 

continuous coverage of TOBI sonar, chirp sonar, bathymetry and surface magnetic data, 

southeast of Pico, S. Jorge and Terceira Island. The second leg provided equivalent data 

on a region comprising the Condor Ridge and the West of Faial and S. Jorge submarine 

prolongations. The sonar data acquired covers a total of 5 complete LVR and the west 

sector of S. Jorge and Faial LVR (Figure V.5). The general quality of the data is fairly 

good with the exception of the shallow portions on the top of the Condor Ridge (south 

of Faial). The analysis of the mosaic corresponding to the SETVR will be performed in 

the next chapter. 

TOBI Sonar is a multi-sensor platform tow-yawed between 200 and 500 m from the 

bottom.  It was equipped with a two sided 30 kHz sidescan sonar, a 7.5 kHz sub-bottom 

profiler, a CTD, a three-axis fluxgate magnetometer and a range of vehicle attitude 

sensors (i.e pitch, roll and heading from a gyro-compass). The instrument is towed with 

a 200 m umbilical behind a depressor weigth detaching the instrument from ship 

movement. TOBI position was achieved by using the ships’ Simrad-Konsgberg HPR-

1507 system and a long-range (6km) transponder, that was mounted 45 deg. below the 

TOBI’s depressor. Sonar has a total swath width of 6 to 8 km, and footprints of 4x 7 m 

near the fish track but higher for the outer beams  

Each mosaic results in a 8 bit image (256 tons of gray) where white pixels portrait high 

backscaterring surfaces and black pixels correspond to acoustic shadows. These images 

were drapped on top of bathymetric digital terrain models. The magnetic anomaly map 

was overlain on top of the composition to further constrain the interpretations.

V.3 Magnetic anomalies and Acoustic Facies interpretation 

V.3.1 LVR Sector 1  

The available mosaics show quite clearly that the bulk of active volcanic activity in the 

Azores western sector is concentrated in LVR, these structures correlate strongly with 

positive magnetic anomalies. Furthermore their surroundings are almost exclusively 

composed of a greyish homogeneous facies interpreted as pelagic and volcanic sediment 

and turbidite fans. 

The main volcanic facies present are homogeneous high backscatter surfaces probably 

related with massive flows, hummocky textures related with pillow mound formation, 

and individual circular volcanic cones sometimes with visible craters, that can reach 

several tens of meters high. They occur both oriented along LVR major axis direction, 

parallel to fault scarps, or as individual cones with a somewhat more random spatial 

distribution.  

It is possible to observe a high backscatter surface prolonging from the Capelinhos 

1957/58 eruption site in the western tip of Faial for about 20 km towards WNW. This 

high backscattering surface is cut by a well marked lineation interpreted as a major 

fissure which aligns up with the Western Faial fissural system.  (Figure V.6).  

Due to its shallow depth the axial structure of the Condor ridge is poorly imaged. Figure 

V.7 displays a high backscattering surface, suggesting a recent nature of the volcanic 

terrain which contrasts with the surrounding greyish areas interpreted as pelagic or 

volcanic  sediment.   The  western  tip  of  this  40  km  long  LVR  consists  of  a highly

irregular pattern of high backscattering acoustic facies, probably related with a 

combination of mass wasting debris at the slopping tip of the LVR and some volcanic 

constructs like individual pillow mounds and more complex hummocky structures. No 

clear tectonic structures are here visible. 

Both LVR and corresponding tips correspond to  marked positive anomalies probably 

Brunhes and their surroundings are a wide area of negative polarity (probably 

Matuyama), which in the case of West condor ridge define two elongated magnetic 

anomaly lows parallel the axis of the LVR. It is not clear if in this case, the negative 

bands were generated at the axis of the W Condor ridge and than rafted sideways. 

However, given the flatness of the W Condor ridge surroundings and the lack of 

significant tectonic or volcanic structures we come to an interpretation where the W 

Condor ridge has simply grown over a negative polarity basement.  

The seawards prolongation of the S. Jorge Island shows features which are somewhat 

distinct from the observations of Faial western sector (Figure V.8). The prominent 

inland fissural system aligned along the Island central axis prolongs seawards in the 

same direction for about 12 km. The submarine extent of the Island western tip displays 

a series of acoustic echoes which, probably due to its shallow depth, are poorly imaged. 

Further west these terminate abruptly towards the centre of a 200 m deep graben. Faults 

defining this graben structure are clearly outlined on the sonar image, they have the 

same orientation of the S. Jorge Island and present little segmentation. There is no 

indication of strike slip component and this are interpreted as dominantly dip-slip faults.  

They extend for about 20 km to the image limits and cut thru seabed sediments, the base 

of  the  fault  scarp  is  irregularly  bordered  by  a  confined  area  of intermediate non-

-homogeneous backscatter which suggests existence of fresh talus deposits and that 

these structures are currently active. Further evidence of activity exists at the centre of 

the graben. Here, four acoustic echoes are present in the graben centre, aligned and 

parallel to the graben bounding faults, some display circular sections. We interpret these 

features as possible indicators of subsurface volcanic phenomena and a clear suggestion 

of recent activity within the fissural system with possible ongoing propagation of the 

LVR westwards.

At ~28º44’W, 38º44’N, in the Northern flank of the Faial Island, an area of 

homogeneous grey acoustic facies, interpreted as sediments, sometimes displaying 

“rippled” surfaces indicating mass wasting transport is disrupted by a set of fault scarps 

displaying cross cutting relations which indicate recent tectonic activity. Two overall 

orientations are observable: one at N120º corresponds overall to the trend of Faial 

Island and the other around N35º. Cross cutting relations between both fault system 

suggest that the latter is older and currently being disrupted by the N120º one  

This area corresponds to a broad roughly circular positive free air anomaly (ca. 53 

mgal) and a positive magnetic anomaly well expressed in Figure V.3, nevertheless no 

obvious volcanic structures are here present. The draping of the sonar image over the 

lower resolution bathymetry reveals some more details of this area. Despite the 

significant sediment cover, this area corresponds in fact to a circular up-lifted seafloor, 

about 200m height, with a roughly flat top (Figure V.9).   

Given the positive potential field anomalies and the circular basal section of the relief, 

we interpret it as possible resulting from the subsurface emplacement of a magmatic 

diapir. The divergent normal faults which are visible in the northern and southern flank 

of this structure could be the result from flexural faulting due to diapir emplacement 

near the surface.

V.3.2 LVR Sector 2 

Contrary to LVR in sector 1, the features within this sector, display a much more 

complex morpho-tectonic and magnetic structure. Magnetic inversions along strike are 

often visible, especially at the EPVR in the southeastern prolongation of Pico Island, 

where interaction between faulting and volcanic edifices exists at least spatially.  

The EPVR despite being a continuous morphological ridge 80 km long, is in fact a 

composite structure with an heterogeneous morpho-tectonic character (Figure V.10. 

From Pico Island Eastern tip to a point located at 27º30’W, 38º06’N the surface of the 

ridge presented two slightly negative polarity areas. One of these areas defines in plan 

view a narrow corridor  oriented NNE-SSW, the corresponding sonar image in this area 

does not show any significant change in seafloor geology, as the top of the ridge 

remains a fairly continuous although heterogeneous high backscattering surface 

suggesting recent volcanism. Some of this effect can be accounted for if one considers a 

context where products of a Brunhes magnetic chron eruption, overlay and cover 

negative anomalies of Matuyama or older ages

Bathymetry is in meters (left axis), Magnetic anomaly in nanoteslas (right axis). Distance along 
profile is equally in meters.

The second negative anomaly, on the contrary, represents a clear change in seafloor 

geology (Figure V.11).  Here the seafloor is punctuated by numerous small cones 

aligned along the LVR axis. An assertion of individual cones height was provided by 

some sections of TOBI bathymetry in the inner half of the swath, where it is possible to 

observe individual cones reaching 60 m high. Lack of significant sedimentation 

suggests that these structures are very recent and are growing over older basement.    

The EPVR as described above terminates at 27º30W and 28ºN in an area of smooth 

bathymetry at 1400m bsl.  From this point southeastwards, the relief broadens and raises 

to a flat terrace at 1200 m bsl. TOBI images display a much more complex signature in 

this domain (see Figure V.12).  

Acoustic facies range from very low backscattering surfaces as before representing 

pelagic/volcanic sediments in the EPVR surrounding areas; intermediate backscattering 

surfaces, interpreted as volcanic terrain with probably higher sediment content 

displaying numerous faults and lineations. Areas with these acoustic facies are 

essentially confined to the center-left of this domain; and finally high backscattering 

surfaces, the geometry of which allows its constraint as individual or composite 

volcanic edifices or ridges and major fault scarps.  These are grouped essentially in two 

clear corridors one along the 38ºN parallel and the other trending ENE-WSW defining 

the southern limit of the EPVR, further ENE aligned with this corridor (see Figures V.4 

and V.5), two seamounts are present which express as two broad negative anomalies. 

Taken together this regional lineament marks the eastern end of LVR sector 2, and 

deepening of Azores plateau to the east.

Figure V.11 - Section of the magnetic anomaly map reproduced in Figure V.10, overlain over the 
TOBI sonar image. It is possible to verify the existence of numerous volcanic cones aligned along 
the EPVR axis on negative magnetic anomaly basement. The high backscattering acoustic facies 
and the overall shape of the volcanic cones suggest that these are recent and currently active 
features.  

 

This domain present three fault families interacting spatially and isolating depressed 

blocks with little or no observable deformation. To differentiate the faults families and 

discriminate more significant faults from other lineations or small fault scarps, we opted 

to trace representative faults in Figure V.12 with a thicker trace.  

Based on their orientation range, we consider the following fault families: N140º-156º 

(hereafter referred to as (A)); N100º-107º (analogously as (B)); N54º-70º (C).  Finally it 

is worth mentioning one single fault striking N9º which seem to have regional 

significance as it separates a domain with strong positive magnetic anomalies to the 

 118 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
east, probably reflecting MAR generated crust, from a western domain with very low 

amplitude magnetic anomalies.  

Analysis of fault geometrical relations provides some constraints on the kinematics of 

the different fault families. With the exception of faults belonging to (B) which seem to 

prevail over the others, cross-cutting relations are not clear and no prevalence of one 

family over the others seems to exist. 

Faults from (A) sometimes isolate semi-circular terraces limited by normal faults 

dipping in the same direction, these structures can be observed, both in a point at ca. 

27º14’W, 37º57’N and ca. 27º24’W, 37º55.5. The S shape, in plain view, of such 

structures and the prevalence of apparent normal components suggest that these are 

oblique slips with a left lateral strike slip component. The left lateral component can be 

additionally constrained by the analysis of a structure at ca. 27º30’W, 37º56’N, where a 

fault striking N148º cuts through a series of sub parallel lineaments If these are 

secondary faults subsidiary of the main shear then their shape in plane view also 

suggests presence of a left lateral  strike slip component. 

Faults belonging to family (B) define a northern deformation corridor. These faults at 

that location present two broad segments with a right lateral en-echelon pattern.. This 

direction is also associated to the major volcanic ridges in the sonar images. 

The (C) fault family is less prevalent than the previous ones in map view, and there are 

no major fault scarps associated with it. Nevertheless, several TOBI sonar lineations 

suggest its presence across the all domain. The most relevant fault of this system is 

about 10 km long and its mid point is located ca. 27º22’W 37º56’N, again relation 

between this fault and minor secondary structures, especially at the westernmost 

 119 



 

Chapter V - LVR as active tectono-magmatic features of the EU-NUB plate boundary 
 
 
sections, points to some component of right lateral strike slip. Finally the same direction 

(as referred to above) is defined by a major SE facing topographical step, corresponding 

to the Eastern limit of LVR 2. To SE of it, the seafloor deepens to 2000m bsl, and high 

backscatter relief’s become absent. 

The last LVR we shall consider in this section is located South of Terceira and will be 

referred to as STVR (South Terceira Volcanic ridge). This structure is 35 km long and 

700 m high, and is sub parallel to the EPVR. The magnetic signature in the STVR 

comprises both negative and positive low amplitude fairly uniform magnetic anomalies 

with no obvious pattern of variation along strike. This is particularly relevant as the 

seafloor north and south of this structure presents higher amplitude positive anomalies 

but no distinct morphological structures when these are compared with both sonar and 

bathymetric images.  

Its geological character as observed from the sonar images (Figure V.13) is similar to 

that of the northwestern part of the EPVR.  Aligned along the STVR axis, numerous 

small individual volcanic cones are present often displaying a small crater and 

sometimes linking and forming ridges which seem analogue to AVR’s (Axial volcanic 

ridges) occurring at Mid-Ocean Ridges. The ridge is dominated by volcanic processes 

as no clear faults are traceable from the TOBI images. The flanks of this structure are 

highly degraded and present numerous slump scars, the mass wasting deposits resulting 

from this slope instability processes suffer little transport and remain confined as lobate 

fans at the base of the LVR.

V.4 Conclusions 

The major characteristics of the Azores Linear Volcanic Ridge systems can be 

summarized as follows: 

1. All volcanic ridges imaged with TOBI sonar, regardless of their magnetic signature 

present recent volcanism of fissural type aligned along their strikes. 

2. Sector 1 LVR seem to be overall more recent than those of sector 2, it shows more 

active volcanic features and displays consistently positive magnetic anomalies along 

their strike. The LVR from sector 2 present a more complex magnetic anomaly 

pattern sometimes masked by possible MAR generated magnetic anomalies. All the 

LVR studied in this chapter present a clear dominance of volcanic processes, little 

tectonisation is observed. 

3. The western terminations of sector 1 LVR display evidences of ridge propagation 

westwards, these comprise graben development west of S. Jorge tip, submarine 

prolongation of the fissural system in Faial, more robust volcanic activity on the 

western tip of condor ridge, and widespread earthquake activity as also detailed in 

section IV.3.1. 

4. As observed in the easternmost areas of the EPVR, the transition between LVR 

sectors corresponds to domains of higher tectonisation where fault families seem to 

define a somewhat irregular and complex shear zone and where essentially three 

fault families were recognized. 

5. The three fault families identified in that area are co-relatable by strike with the 

expected orientation respectively of MAR transform zones and LVR1 strikes. 

 123 



 

Chapter V - LVR as active tectono-magmatic features of the EU-NUB plate boundary 
 
 

Oblique faults with a possible sinistral strike slip component as those which ruptured 

during the Terceira 1980 and Faial 1998 earthquakes (see section IV.4) and finally 

those which correspond to secondary ruptures at nearly 90º with the previous ones 

during the same Faial earthquake. The tectonic significance of these later orientations 

had never been discussed in previous works until the Faial event (Dias, 2006, 

Fernandes et al., 2002) despite their morphological signature across the plateau 

having been noted by Lourenço et al., 1998). They individualize the studied LVR 

sectors, and surrounding flat terraces which become deeper towards east. This 

direction as we shall see in the next chapter is also recognized inland at Terceira 

Island.

 Chapter VI - Tectonics on the Terceira Island and neighbouring basins 

VI.1 Introduction 

The northern limit of the plateau consists of the Terceira rift. Its morphology is 

characterized by a series of deep rhombic to square shape basins in plane view 

separating the Islands and other major volcanic constructions which express as shallow 

submarine banks. The distribution of the central volcanoes along the rift is relatively 

regular, with major, active edifices every 80 to 100 km (Formigas, Grande Norte, São 

Miguel – Sete Cidades, João de Castro submarine volcano, Terceira – Stª Barbara and 

Graciosa main central volcano). Spreading centers with this characteristic spacing 

characterize the second-order segmentation of most ultra-slow to slow-spreading mid-

ocean ridges (Briais and Rabinowicz, 2002; Rabinowicz and Briais, 2002). It is possible 

that the distribution of the recent volcanic activity along the Terceira axis reflects a 

control of the magma feeding by mantle processes, or by melt migration processes. 

Vogt and Jung (2003) compared the morphological characteristics of the Terceira axis 

with other ultra-slow spreading systems such as the South-West Indian Ridge (SWIR) 

or the Gakkel ridge and classified it as an oblique, hiper-slow rift system. The Terceira 

axis is considered, by these authors as a young (possible&amp;lt;1Ma) and wide oblique 

graben structure disrupted and segmented by the equispaced volcanic centers. 

 125 



 
Chapter VI - Tectonics on the Terceira Island and neighbouring basins 
  
 
As we discussed in Chapter II, the nucleation age for the Terceira axis has never been 

totally constrained. Its complex magnetic structure, and lack of magnetic anomalies 

older than Matuyama (Luis, et al., 1996), does not allow its classification as a fully 

developed oceanic spreading system or otherwise as a young intra-oceanic rift system.  

The magnetic and morpho-tectonic structure of the Terceira axis, varies significantly 

between the Western half of Terceira Island and adjoining East graciosa Basin and the 

Eastern half of Terceira Island and the North Hirondelle Basin (Figure VI.1). The 

separation between these two domains is defined by the intersection of the Terceira 

Island with the prolongation to NE of the limit between LVR sector 1 and 2.  West of 

Terceira, the Serreta ridge, disrupts the eastern flank of the East Graciosa Basin. The 

most recent volcanic eruption in the Azores occurred on this ridge. East of the Island, 

several linear volcanic ridges with heterogeneous magnetic character converge into the 

Island plateau and define a broad v-shape morphology. To the present day it has never 

been clear, if accretion takes place in a single or in several neovolcanic axis in this plate 

boundary, and, as pointed by Searle (1980), if main plate boundary processes are 

located in the bottom of the basins or associated with the linear volcanic ridges that 

border them. 

In this chapter we use all available altimetric/bathymetric data sources both in Terceira, 

the East Graciosa Basin and the North Hirondele basin, to create an integrated Digital 

Terrain Model (DTM). This map is used to interprete the tectonic pattern and its 

variations within the context of Terceira axis as a plate boundary. By comparing 

observations from both basins and in different sectors of the Island, we aim to verify if 

the tectonic observations can be explained by a single tectonic regime (i.e right lateral 

transtension)  or  if  strain  is accommodated  differently  in the  domains to the west and

framework for this area. 

VI.2 Data and strategy 

The compilation of bathymetric data acquired prior to 1998, presented by Lourenço et 

al. (1998) was updated since, with other swath bathymetry data more focused around 

the Terceira Island (Figure VI.2a), namely: 1) the SIRENA cruise (PI Jean Goslin) 

provided a small Simrad EM300 survey gridded at 60x60m in the submarine ridge 

located southeast of the Terceira Island (SETVR). The Serreta ridge, NW of Terceira, 

was mapped over the Serreta eruption area by the R/V KNORR (Voyage 161, leg 4) 

using a Seabeam 2100. MARCONNI contracted a inter-Island EM12 survey for optical 

cable festooning and finally a EM12 transit from TRIATNORD cruise was gridded at 

100x100 m resoluton (Goslin et al., 1999). Island topography was retrieved from digital 

terrain models (DTM) from IGEOE and gridded at 30 x 30 m resolution. The resulting 

map is presented in figure VI.2b. The swath bathymetry coverage is still rather limited 

especially in the northern flank of the Terceira axis. It is possible to observe a sharp 

contrast in the information provided by the higher resolution data sets, notably the 

SIRENA, Knorr and the Island DTM with respect to background bathymetric image 

from Lourenço et al., (1998).  

The map is analysed together with very high resolution (4 m x 4 m) orto-photo maps 

covering the Island, to retrieve a regional lineation map.  This map comprises confirmed 

or possible faults and volcanic alignments and unassigned lineations retrived from the 

ortho-photo maps and from the DTM. The orientation of all digitized features was 

analyzed and grouped in sets based on characteristic ranges of orientations.  Fault 

 128 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
kinematic constraints were interpreted based on the spatial relations between the 

different sets and validated by direct field observations.   

The analysis of bathymetric data was complemented with geological and tectonic 

interpretations provided by high resolution sonar images acquiered during the Azzorre 

99 cruise over the SETVR (See chapter V).  

VI.3 Terceira Tectonics 

VI.3.1 Geological setting  

The Terceira Island is the third largest Island in the Azores Archipelago with an area of 

402 km2. and is approximately 29 km long in the W-E direction and 18 km wide in the 

N-S direction (Figure VI.3). The Island is made up of four overlapping strato-volcanos 

with summit calderas, build up of volcanic sucessions ranging from basaltic to trachyte 

lava flows and pyroclastic deposits (Self, 1976; Calvert et al., 2006; Nunes 2000). From 

west to east, the volcanos St. Barbara, Guilherme Moniz and Cinco Picos are ligned up 

along a fissural system materialized by alignments of scoria and pumice cones of 

essentially basaltic nature following the same strike. St. Barbara is the most robust 

volcano and its summit marks the highest point of the Island (1021 m).  Located to NE 

of St. Barbara, the Caldera of Pico Alto is a cluster of trachyte domes and short trachyte 

flows in close association with The Guilherme Moniz northern flank. From these four 

polygenetic volcanos only St. Barbara and Pico Alto are considered active (Self, 1976). 

The later is considered the source for the extensive pyroclastic deposits belonging to the 

Lages Ignimbrite covering the NE extent of the Island (Nunes et al., 2000) and which 

erupted some 19 to 21 Ka (Self et al., 1976; Calvert et al., 2006).   Age relations have 

been established from geological mapping (Zbyszewski et al., 1971) and volcanic 

 129 



 
Chapter VI - Tectonics on the Terceira Island and neighbouring basins 
  
 
stratigraphy studies (Self, 1976, Nunes, 2000).  K/Ar dating (Feraud  et al., 1980)  for 

the top of the different calderas yield values ranging from less then 30 Ka in Stª Barbara 

to 300 Ka at the “Serra do Cume” (“Cinco Picos”).  More recently Calvert et al. (2006), 

performed seven new 40Ar/39Ar on Terceira Island, there main results point to a E-W 

progression in strato-volcano growth. Cinco Picos argon ages yields 370 Ka to 380 Ka 

for end of volcano growth and formation of the large 7 x 9 km caldera later covered by 

basalts from the fissural system. The interior of the caldera also presents some volcanic 

cones related with this system. Guilherme Moniz was active from 270 Ka to 111 Ka. 

The vast majority of Pico Alto eruption, according to the same authors took place in the 

interval between 9000 and 1000 years BP. Finaly the Argon age of 29 Ka for the St. 

Barbara volcano is consistent with that obtained by Feraud (1980).   

Historical eruptions have occurred associated both with St Barbara volcano and the 

fissural system. Hot springs “furnas de enxofre” exist in the center of the Island. In 1761 

two occurrences are documented. The event started by an explosion on the Misterio dos 

Negros location. East of this site, and shortly after the explosion a basaltic flow 

designated by “Mistério dos Biscoitos” occurred, flowing from the fissural system along 

the Northern flank of the Island (Zbyszewski et al., 1971). Other recent eruptions at the 

centre of the Island and linked with the fissural system displayed an isotopic age of 

approximately 2115 years (Zbyszewski et al, 1971). At sea, volcanic activity has been 

concentrated NW of the Island in a submarine shallow ridge striking WNW-ESE named 

Serreta. This was the location of the 1867 and 1999 eruptions (Luis et al., 1999). (see 

section VI.4.1).

VI.3.2 Volcano-tectonic lineations in Terceira Island from DTM and ortophoto maps 
interpretation 

The Terceira lineation map is presented in Figure VI.4. The main directions present on 

the Island are grouped in three different azimuthal classes: lineations labelled as FLT 

comprise: confirmed faults from field analysis and inferred faults from linear steps in  

morphology.   Volcanic  lineations  (VLC)   consisting   on:   volcanic   cone  alignment

mapped fissures, elongation direction of individual volcanos and field measurements of 

dike strikes. Finally a set of lineations retrieved from the coupled analysis of the DTM 

and the ortophotomaps but which could not be assigned to either of the previous classes, 

during field work are attributed to a generic unassigned lineation class (LIN). The bulk 

rose diagram plot of these sets lineations is presented in figure VI.5).  

Despite some scatter in the plot, we verify that measured azimuths group in three main 

domains: The dominant structural direction is N140-160º (12% of overall data) and 

corresponds to the expression of the fissural system on the eastern side of the Island, 

and the en-echelon configuration of some of the individual cones within this system on 

the western side, which, in turn, presents a dominant N110-120º direction (Figure VI.5 

and Figure VI.6).  

Volcanic lineations strike (Figure VI.5), plot over the range span of the strikes of FLT 

and LIN. This seems to attest the tectonic control on volcanism in this domain. The 

fissural system present in all extent of the island follows both N110º-120º and N140º-

160º trends.  The fissural system controls the position and elongation of several cinder 

and scoria cones which are generally located south of the main fissural system (Figure 

VI.6).  

A clear separation between the two fissural domains is provided by a previously un-

recognized orientation set varying between N50º to N70º (8%). These lineations are 

very discrete and no clear planes were observed in the field, nevertheless they seem to 

have controlled some flows on the eastern flank of Pico Alto and Guilherme Moniz 

Caldera,  as  some  of  these  flows  are  oblique  to  the maximum gradients within their

flanks. Figure VI.6 displays some of this lineations present in the SE flank of St. 

Barbara volcano.  

These lineations seem to be the inland continuation of the morphological set which 

separates LVR1 from LVR2 sectors. They also divide the Island in two different 

morpho-tectonic domains. To the East, Island topography is smooth, tectonic structures 

prevail, and the sole central volcano has been largely eroded and is now materialized by 

the Serra do Cume and the (fault controlled?)  linear Serra da Ribeirinha. To the west, 

the robust St Barbara volcano with a altitude of 1021 m dominates, eventually masking 

existing faults.  The set of measured azimuths within the St Barbabra volcanic edifice 

reveal partially a radial pattern around the main caldera of this volcano.  

Identified Faults (Figure VI.5) trend essentially in two main directions one corresponds 

to the Lages graben (N130º-140º) and the other is represented by several faults east of 

Angra city which are dominantly in the N160º-170º azimuth  interval. 

We note that some linear segments on the Island coast are parallel to these structural 

orientations and probably represent tectonic controls on coastal erosion. Careful 

inspections of Island cliffs have however yielded little tectonic data.  

VI.3.3  Meso-scale observations 

Forest, extensive areas of agriculture land and the intrinsic nature of the volcanic terrain 

rather limits the ability to detect tectonic structures in the field. Identified fault planes 

provided little kinematics indications. The vast majority of identified faults lie on the 

eastern side of the Island. Some could be observed on the southern coast cliffs by 

apparent vertical offsets in lava sequences co-relatable on the hanging wall and the 

footwall across the fault plane.

Chapter VI - Tectonics on the Terceira Island and neighbouring basins 
  
 
The faults in the Island, group in two main areas (see Figure VI.4) for location: the 

Lages Graben faults and The East Angra faults. These are briefly documented below. 

Additionally it is worth mentioning a set of brittle structures associated with the onset of 

a trachytic lava flow in the Ponta da Serreta promontory. Despite constituting a 

somewhat off-topic, we opted to address them in this manuscript as an illustration of the 

peculiarities that can arise from tectonic studies in volcanic terrains. 

VI.3.3.1 The Lages Graben  

The Lages Graben, the most evident tectonic feature in Terceira Island, is a 10 km long, 

3.5 km wide and trends N130º. This feature may extend further SE through the seafloor. 

The surface of the graben is covered by a ignimbrite deposit dated of 18 Kyr BP (Before 

Present) by Feraud et al. (1980).  The Lages Graben North-Eastern bounding fault 

(NELF) is well expressed in topography.  The NELF in plan view presents three sinuous 

segments with a tight en-echelon configuration. Further to SE, near Praia da Victoria, 

within the graben, a secondary fault is traceable from the topography and has been 

mapped in the Terceira Geological Map (Zbyszewski et al., 1971) 

Each segment displays a well defined SW facing scarp. At the tips of the segments the 

scarp is strongly attenuated and is retreated to its adjacent scarp traces therefore 

defining bridge structures  (Figure VI.7). The bridge structures can result from 1) the 

en-echelon nature of the fault; 2) interaction with intersecting faults and 3) soft linkage 

at adjacent fault segment tips (Hossack, 1983). We were not able to verify any of these 

possibilities during field work. 

The NELF fault zone is exposed in an outcrop on the Island’s NE coast (station 1 in 

Figure VI.4 and VI.7). It presents a well exposed section of the fault damage zone (see 

 138 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
Figure VI.8). It consists on a 5 m wide zone of tectonic brecciation. Within this zone 

two clear sub-parallel fault traces are present. The SW one is sub-vertical. The NE one 

is a normal fault plunging about 60º to SW, which displacement defines the graben 

scarp.  The vertical fault plane within the NELF fault damage zone, it is not consistent 

with a pure dip slip displacement for the NELF, and suggests: 1) that some amount of 

strike slip component should present in that fault and 2) that the imposed strain is 

accommodated by slip partitioning between these two planes, one acting solely as strike 

slip fault and the other as pure dip-slip fault.

Overview of hanging wall deformation.  

 

The hanging wall block consist on a yellowish pyroclastic infill and is disrupted by a set 

of closely spaced antithetic rotational normal faults which constitute the testimony of 

the last increments of the NELF growth.  The infill sequence and the fault itself are 

sealed by a thin top layer of dark brown pyroclastic materials.

The SWLF fault is less well exposed. The clear step observed in topography consists on 

a contact between a trachyte flow unit and the graben floor. We performed, where 

possible, a series of transects across this morphological step, normal to the possible fault 

trace, which did not result in any clear fault plane identification. We noted nevertheless 

that, to NE of the main morphological step, the bottom of the graben is reached by a 

succession of small step like terraces, providing faint lineations in the DTM retrieved 

images and contour maps (Figure VI.4). Confirmation of these as fault related, is 

achieved in the western sector of the Praia da Victoria bay cliff (station 2 in Figure 

VI.7). Here, faults crop out and a complete geological cross section on the SW graben 

bounding faults is displayed. (Figure VI.9). The overall SW-NE oriented cross section 

displays a cylindrical fold in pyroclasts, with 20º deeping flanks and axial plane nearly 

E-W.  It is unclear if this fold is simply the result of cohesive ash fall deposition over a 

possible positive paleo-relief in the sub-surface or whether it results from tectonic 

processes. Further NE from the fold, a horst structure is present, defined to SW by a 60º 

deeping normal fault, striking N144º (F2 in Figure VI.8), thus subparallel to the SWLF; 

and to NE by a fault (F1) striking N80ºW and dipping 75º northwards.  Analogously to 

the NELF, the dips of this fault exclude them as having simple dip-slip components, and 

suggest existance of some sort of strain partitioning, with presence of oblique or strike 

slip components. Considering the regional fault kinematics, it is conceivable that F1 is 

associated with right lateral strike slip. In this case the observed fold could also form, as 

a consequence of space problems, at the intersection between both fault systems. 

Verification of this hypothesis however, was not possible, as we were not able to detect 

any occurrence of faults to SW of the fold.

VI.3.3.2 The East Angra Faults  

Located to the North and East of Angra do Heroismo City, The East Angra faults are a 

set of sub-parallel faults striking N!60º to N170º (see Figure VI.4 for location of station 

3). These faults are well exposed in the Southern Terceira coastal cliffs (Figure VI.10), 

They are expressed in the topography as tens of meters setps. In the Coastal Cliffs, we 

could verify that these faults present a clear normal component. In a recent paper, 

Navarro et al. (in press) evaluated these faults as having a left lateral component; In 

fact, after the 1980 Angra do Heroismo main shock, some epicenters of the aftershock 

sequence layed along these faults (Hirn et al., 1980) and were probably related with 

some stress transfer mechanisms (Ribeiro personal comn.). Fault plane inspection did 

not yield any clear kinematic indicators. 

Several fractures following the strikes of the East Angra Faults are detected all along the 

East of Angra do Heroismo coast. Some of this fractures control the installation of sub-

vertical dykes, which in some cases display evidences of subhorizontal magmatic flow. 

An example is presented in Figure VI.10.  

Taking as a reference the produced lineation map, we consider these faults to be the 

southern prolongation of the N-S lineations observed in the Island Northern coastal 

areas and in the northern flank of Guilherme Moniz Cladera. The rectilinear west edge 

of this caldera system also suggests some control from the same fault system. We 

consider that this system of lineations and faults, constitute abyssal hill fabric 

reactivated within the Azores stress field.

VI.3.3.3 The Serreta trachytic flows 

In this section we present clear tectonic-like structures, which were developed and are 

confined within the Ponta da Serreta trachytic flow (site 4 in Figure VI.4). Its tectonic 

pattern when considered as a whole is consistent with the regional tectonic stress field, 

however, in fact it translates the dynamic history of the cooling flow.  

 The Serreta trachytic flow (Ponta da Serreta) is several tens of meters high and is 

capped by a lava clinker (Figure VI.11). Orto-photo with 0.5 x 0.5 m pixel resolution 

and DTM were used to constrain the lava surface structures. Structural lineation map 

(Figure VI.12) displays the trend of arcuate ridges, with typical wavelengths of 30 to 45 

m, resulting from lava cooling and compression induced by lava gravitational flow. To 

the N, a set of WNW-ESE lineations mark the right lateral sheared border of the 

flow.and and correspond to vertical tear faults accommodating differential movements 

within the flow.

The structures observed in the Ponta da Serreta seacliff are brittle to ductile shear zones 

developing low angle frontal (synthetic and antithetic) and lateral ramps; deformed 

columnar disjunction and other brittle planar discontinuities. Ductile-brittle transition in 

a context of progressive deformation within viscous flow is given by the deformed 

prisms. Flow front is characterised by brittle reverse faults and extensional fractures 

(Figure VI.11).

Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
At the meso-scale, structures express distinct strain mechanisms imposed by significant 

rheological variations, resulting from drastic centrifugal thermal gradients. Flow core, 

corresponding to the front of the outcropping lava lobe, presents dominantly ductile 

deformation. It displays a fan like pattern of stretching lineations materialized by 

alignment of feldspar crystals growing upon complex magmatic foliations.  Ductile to 

brittle transitions within volcanic flow are observed from either co-planar or oblique 

discrete fault surfaces developing in lava lobe outer shells and they are interpreted as 

incremental colder pulses postdating quasi-coeval magmatic foliations and sharing a 

common kinematic history for the entire flow unit (Figure VI.13). 

Identified fault kinematic criteria are fault grooves and striations sometimes presenting 

cross-cutting relations, and ranging from dip slip to oblique slip both with normal and 

reverse components (Figure VI.13). The stereographic plot of existing fault planes and 

fault kinematic criteria is consistent with a local stress field generated by the gravity 

flow of the freezing lava (Figure VI.14). 

In summary, impressive fault structures in the brittle-ductile transition can develop 

within a trachytic volcanic flow. These develop in a context of progressive deformation 

due to the cooling lava. The physical similarity between such cooling induced structures 

and those produced by a regional tectonic stress field (as discussed by Madeira and 

Ribeiro, 1990 and Lourenço et al., 1998) imply that interpretation of volcanic lavas 

outcrops from past terrains have to be evaluated in a careful manner as they might 

produce erroneous tectonic interpretations.

VI.4 Tectonic interpretations from the adjacent basins 

VI.4.1 West of Terceira: The Serreta Ridge structure  

The Serreta ridge is a shallow submarine feature, extending from the west coast of 

Terceira Island for about 20 km along the WNW-ESE direction, therefore parallel to 

both flanks of East Graciosa Basin and also to the sector 1 LVR, described in the 

previous chapter. The Serreta ridge flanks are higly assymetrical. Its southern flank 

deepens to the base of the East Graciosa Basin defining a slope of more than 1000 m, on 

the contrary the northern flank base lies at a westward dipping slope, which follows 

 149 



 
Chapter VI - Tectonics on the Terceira Island and neighbouring basins 
  
 
roughly the same westward inclination of the Serreta ridge axis. Therefore the northern 

flank Serreta presents a fairly uniform height of ca. 500 m. The spatial relation of 

Serreta structure with the main St. Barbara volcano seems analogue of what was 

observed between the Capelinhos fissural system and the Faial Island central caldera. 

The axis of Serreta is well aligned with the inland fissural system, suggesting that the 

St. Barbara volcano has grow over and masked it. 

Northwards, sub-parallel to the Serreta ridge, two more ridges are present (Ridges 2 and 

3) (Figure VI.15) both with a length of approximately 8 km and an average height of 

respectively 400 m and 200 m. Ridge 2 aligns with a massif trachytic flow on land,  

suggesting a structural control of the valley where this flow is present. Ridge 3 has no 

obvious prolongation in land. 

The three main ridges present a similar morphology and are spaced at equal intervals of 

4 km. Despite some limitations in the areal extent of the survey, their configuration 

suggests a rigth lateral en-echelon pattern along N65º.  Contrary to Serreta Ridge which 

displays a strong positive anomaly of about 1000 nT, the other two neighbouring ridges 

present negative anomalies of respectively ca. -50 nT and ca. -1060 nT. If these are 

contemporary features, as their morphology suggests, than they are growing on strong 

reversely magnetized basement of the Terceira axis. Other possibility, given their 

magnetic anomalies, is that they are older features. In this case, their orientations 

suggesting a fairly homogeneous stress field along recent times in this domain.  

The three ridges are formed by several segments linked together either due to bending 

of continuous ridge tips towards one another, or by possible splay formation from the 

dominate ridge segment. These linkage zones are areas of disturbed relief. In the Serreta 

 150 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
ridge crest, linkage areas result in formation of a series of flat round or square 

depressions aligned along the main ridge direction and limited overall by several minor 

ridges. 

Other features present in this domain are smaller, more discontinuous ridges parallel to 

the main ones, and a semi-circular depression present between ridges 1 and 2 which can 

possibly be a degraded small caldera arch. Near the western tip of the Serreta Ridge and 

also scattered in the imaged area, numerous small elevations punctuate the sea floor, 

similarly to what have been observed west of Condor Ridge. 

VI.4.1.1 Serreta 1998-2001 Eruption 

The 18th December 1998, after a period of some micro-seismic activity registered by 

the local seismic network, local fisherman observed sea surface manifestations of a 

submarine eruption. This phenomenon, located at 38º46.8’N 27º28.6’W (Figure VI.16), 

was confined to the ridge crest of Serreta. The beginning of the eruption was focused in 

three different areas, developing later to a number of six different focalised areas. 

Nevertheless all these manifestations were consistently aligned along a NE-SW 

direction (Gaspar et al., 2003).  The eruption had constant activity throughout 1999, and 

localized emanations or micro-seismic activity have been reported in the area until 

2001. 

It comprised plumes of smoke emanating from cooling floating lava ballons (Gaspar et 

al., 2003), as big as 3m in length consisting on vitreous basalt (figure VI.17). The 

eruption was high in volatile content, as the debris normally presented empty cavities 

formed by gas accumulations, at the surface. As cooling occured, seawater entering 

through the cracks and gas liberation promoted plunging or sometimes explosion of the 

 151 



 
Chapter VI - Tectonics on the Terceira Island and neighbouring basins 
  
 
debris (floating time: 15 minutes in average). This eruption was not continuous; it 

pulsed between periods of moderate activity and others of relatively quietness with total 

lack of volcanic activity at the sea surface.  

 

 

Figure VI.15 - Model depicting possible tectonic interpretation for the Serreta Ridge Area. Ridges 
would act as dominantly tension cracks with possibly a minor right lateral component. Shear 
components would be largely accommodated in N150º faults and N65º transfer zones. 

 152 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
During the 500 years of human settlement in Azores, a significant number of submarine 

eruptions have already occurred, sometimes evolving into ephemeral Islands (a 

complete synthesis of Azores eruptions may be found in the paper of Weston (1964). 

The eruption site was very close to the location of other submarine eruption which 

occurred in the year of 1867. The later was preceded by premonitory tremors that lasted 

five months culminating with violent earthquakes and explosive volcanism that lasted 

only a week and produced damage in the Terceira Island. On the contrary, the Serreta 

eruption has lasted for longer time and seems to have been much more effusive in 

character and, given the geometry of the sea-floor manifestations, of a fissural nature.

Chapter VI - Tectonics on the Terceira Island and neighbouring basins 
  
 
Using sparse echo-soundings collected by the Portuguese Hidrographic Institute prior to 

the onset of the eruption, and multi-beam data collected by the Knorr, after the eruption 

main episodes, we are able to trace, at least qualitatively, the changes in the seafloor 

topography (See Figure VI.18). The pre-eruption survey displays an ortogonal “bay” 

like relief which interrupts the Serreta ridge crest. This bay is open southwards. The 

most significant change in the topography at the eruption site, is visible in the post 

eruption survey as that “embayment” is now closed into a square section depression and 

the Serreta ridge becomes a continuous feature. Despite the different resolutions of the 

surveys, profiles from both surveys, across this new feature, yield sufficient bathymetric 

correlation on the sections off the eruption location to allow characterization of 

bathymetry change. The profiles suggest that the eruption probably started a a depth of 

around 450 m bsl and created a continuous relief about 120 m high, overall. The slope 

of the southern flank probably became steeper as suggested by the profiles. The 

orientation of the newly formed ridge does not match the reports of NE-SW but 

observation suggest that some leakage from a NNE-SSW ridge east of it but in close 

proximity might have occurred (Gaspar et al., 2003)

VI.4.2  East of Terceira: Geological inferences from a transect across the Terceira axis. 

Contrary to the observations in the Terceira Island and the East Graciosa basin, the 

domain comprising the North Hirondelle Basin and the adjacent off-Terceira axis 

domain, displays a much more complex pattern with areas dominated clearly by 

volcanic processes whereas others display high levels of tectonic deformation and 

 155 



 
Chapter VI - Tectonics on the Terceira Island and neighbouring basins 
  
 
others still display relatively flat surfaces with little evidence of volcano-tectonic 

activity. The orientation of the main morphological features, changes drastically when 

compared to the Serreta domain or to the western part of the Island, but is consistent 

with the observations on its eastern side. 

The transition form NHB to the South Hirondelle Basin (SHB) defines a step in 

morphology which orientation corresponds to the prolongation northeastwards of the 

eastern transition from LVR sector 2 to deeper areas (see section V.3). The João de 

Castro Bank, a shallow (~13 m bsl) caldera system lies over this probable tectonic limit.  

From the gathered swath bathymetric data, we only have a profile, which crosses the all 

extent of the Terceira axis, perpendicularly to it.  The profile is located at the 

northwestern limit of the NHB (see Figure VI.1 for location).  Its analysis, combined 

with magnetic data, provides some constraints about the Terceira axis major morpho-

structural features (See Figure VI.19). From Northeast to Southwest the transition from 

the abyssal plain into the Azores plateau is defined by an asymmetric ridge. The 

northern flank of this structure is about 900 m high defines the edge of the plateau (we 

designated it as ER – Edge of plateau Ridge). The southern flank of this structure is 

about 300m high and bounds a 400 m depression elongated parallel to the Regional 

Terceira axis strike. This graben like basin (hereafter called ED – Edge of the plateau 

Depression) lacks any significant seismo-tectonic activity but presents nonetheless high 

magnetizations, in the order of those observed further SE in the seismically active 

portion of the Terceira axis.  The single passage of swath bathymetry reveals that the 

floor of this depression is disrupted by normal faults striking N130º-140º (n= 9) parallel 

to the ER, and two volcanic cones about 200 m high are partially imaged.

Figure VI.19 -  Series of profiles performed over a single passage of EM300 swath bathymetry data 
across the Terceira axis (see Figure VI.1 for profile location).  Based on their morpho-tectonic and

Ridge; NHB – North Hirondelle Basin; East Terceira Volcanic Ridge (positive); East Terceira 
Volcanic Ridge (negative anomalies 

 

 157 



 
Chapter VI - Tectonics on the Terceira Island and neighbouring basins 
  
 
The following topographical high, here referred to as the East Terceira Volcanic Ridge 

Ridge (ETVR), shows two distinct areas based on the orientation of tectonic structures 

and its magnetic character. The first of these areas tends to have negative or near zero 

magnetizations and corresponds to a rough surface deepening towards East. Normal 

fault scarps imaged by the single passage confined to this areas of low magnetization 

have a distinctive orientation from the previous ones, as they strike between N110º and 

N114º (n=4). Volcanic structures are absent.  Further Southwest the ETVR becomes 

strongly positive (locally in the profile it reaches ca 7 Am/m) and dominated by 

volcanic processes. This is confirmed, as we shall see below, by the far NE portion of 

the Sirena bathymetric map and the AZ99 TOBI mosaic, where in the prolongation of 

this domain towards SE, numerous volcanic cones cover deeper portions of the NHB 

(see Figure VI.2 for spatial reference).   

The NHB, in this profile is bound between the ETVR and the Southeast Terceira 

Volcanic Ridge (SETVR). In pratice, it prolongs towards the Terceira Island as a V-

shaped depression, where its apex, at around 300 m bsl, defines the geometrical 

convergence between both marginal ridges.  

VI.4.3 The SouthEast Terceira Ridge (SETVR) 

The amount of data over this ridge, either from swath bathymetry from Sirena I cruise  

(Lourenço et al., 2003) and the TOBI mosaic that was performed during the Azzore99 

cruise (Ligi et al., 1999), makes one of the most documented submarine structures in the 

Azores apart from the Islands themselves. For instance GLORIA images from Searle 

(1980) see Figure VI.20, would only provide a hint on the high level of tectonic 

deformation here present, and in terms of regional bathymetry, (as observable in Figure 

VI.2) despite reproducing the overall shape of the ridge, it does not provide any 

 158 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
indication at all of relevant tectonic features. These data on the SETVR proofs the 

importance of having a wider swath bathymetric coverage of the Azores Plateau. 

The ridge presents a NW-SE orientation, it is seismically active (see Figure VI.1) and 

corresponds mainly to Brunhes magnetic epoch. The bathymetry and sonar maps reveal 

a clear partition between tectonic processes, centred in the ridge, and volcanism present 

at the bottom of the North Hirondelle basin.

Chapter VI - Tectonics on the Terceira Island and neighbouring basins 
  
 
The acoustic facies interpretation from TOBI is presented in Figure VI.21. We have 

defined essentially 5 different acoustic facies: Clusters of bright linear, or otherwise 

linear acoustic shadows (for faults facing away from sonar ensonification direction), are 

classified as tectonic terrain, polygons of faults identified within this domain were 

digitized. High to medium backscattering surfaces, with irregular textures sometimes 

forming hummocks or with identifiable conic or with basal circular sections have been 

classified as volcanic terrain. If a significant number of faults were present disrupting 

bright backscaterring surfaces, these domains were classified as tectonised volcanic 

terrain. Sediment terrain corresponds to areas of homogeneous low backscatter. Finally, 

making additional use of swath bathymetry to help interpretation process and define 

more sharply the base of the ridge, areas of talus deposits and mass wasting deposits 

were mapped. In the first case, outlined by narrow bands, at the base of fault scarps, 

with variable degrees of backscatter, characteristic of talus deposits. Corrugations in 

sediment facies in the dowdip direction and flanking fan like shapes in plan view, 

typical of slump deposits (Figure VI.22-3) were indistinctly classified as mass wasting 

deposits. 

 The SETVR axis is a broad high backscatter surface of volcanic nature, given its high 

amplitude magnetic anomaly. All the areal extent of the ridge is disrupted by a strand of 

sub-parallel but highly anastomosed normal faults striking between N130º and N150º.  

At 27ºW, 38º25N, in the SW ridge axial flank, a distinct rhombic shape topographic low 

is present, defined by a continuous low backscattering sedimented surface which 

correlates with a negative magnetic anomaly. This low is fault controlled in its Southern 

and Northern limits. Its Eastern and Western flanks, correspond to sharp N-S contacts 

 160 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
between low and high backscaterring surfaces, which are cut through, by faults 

belonging the same dominant fault system in the SETVR.  

The top of the SETVR consists on an arched demi-.horst, and it is interpretable either as 

volcanic structure remnant (caldera system?), existing prior to onset of the tectonic 

stage in the ridge or otherwise a giant scar from the gravitational collapse of the 

northeastern flank. Both ridge flanks display gullies and mass wasting fans at the base 

of the slope (Figure VI.22-3). The ridge vicinities are almost exclusively composed of a 

grayish homogeneous acoustic facies interpreted as pelagic and volcanic sediment. The 

numerous untectonized volcanic cones, present to NE, in the northern flank of the North 

Hirondelle basin (see Figures VI.19 and VI.22-1), form alignments sub-parallel to the 

ridge main strike and contrast with the densly fractured pattern observable in the 

SETVR. The high magnetization values observed in the areas covered by this volcanic 

constructs suggests that this is the current neo-volcanic axis in this domain. Limited 

data, limits our ability to constrain its areal extent along the plate boundary. 

Faulting geometries their inter-relationships and fault orientations, in the SETVR, 

provide clues concerning their kinematic behaviour. Some faults present horse-tail 

terminations. Fault splays often link to neighbour faults defining extensional duplexes 

(Figure VI.22-2), relay ramps and fault wedge basins and highs of roughly rhombic 

shape (see Figure VI.22-4). These faulting patterns observed in the SETVR are 

conformal with right lateral oblique extension component. Typical wrench structures 

like strike slip pull-apart basins are not observed in this domain.

VI.5 Discussion and conclusions  

In this chapter we have addressed the tectonic pattern, and the partition between 

volcanic and tectonic processes in the Terceira axis, between the East Graciosa Basin 

and the North Hirondelle Basin.  

The distribution of tectonic and volcanic processes varies significantly across the 

studied sector of the Terceira axis. In Figure VI.23 we present a tectonic model that 

summarizes our main observations. West of Terceira, volcanic accretion seems confined 

to the Serreta ridge, expressing as fault controlled fissural volcanism. The East graciosa 

basin floor is barren in volcanism and clear cut tectonic structures, nevertheless a left 

lateral strike slip  N150º faulting direction is bound to play a significant role in the plate 

boundary strain accomodation. Linkage of bathymetric observations with inland data is 

straight forward for the Serreta ridge as the submarine prolongation of the fissural 

system inland, clearly expressed between the Guilherme Moniz and St. Barbara 

calderas.  

The Island of Terceira displays a complex tectonic pattern where four tectonic 

directions were recognaized often controlling volcanic cone morphology, dikes, lava 

flows paths and possibly same sections of the coast line. These are according to strike:  

1) WNW-ESE. Corresponding to the fissural system in the Island west of Guilherme 

Moniz Caldera.  Possibly corresponding to tension fractures with some minor rigth 

lateral displacement provided by the en-echelon arrangement of individual cones 

elongation axis.

2) N-S. Expressed by the East Angra faults; interpreted as possible reactivation of MAR 

generated fabric. This system ruptured as left lateral Strike slips in the 1980 Terceira 

earhquake.   

3) NNW-SSE. Expressed by the Lages Graben and the Cinco Picos Caldera fissural 

system. Co-existance of vertical and 60º dipping fault planes belonging to this fault 

family suggest that some strain partitioning should exist associated with it. 

4) ENE-WSW lineation family. These devide the Island in two halfs with distinct 

morphologies. Volcano-tectonic orientations also denote the clear change in orientation 

of the fissural system between the Island western and eastern halfs. Furthermore as 

discussed in Chapter V, this fabric seems to have a regional significance related as a 

relay zone parallel to the opening direction between AF (Nub) and Eurasia as 

constrained by NUVEL1A kinematic model. 

The seafloor structure East of Terceira displays a higher magnetic and morpho-

strucutural complexity than the submarine domain west of it. The linkage of submarine 

observations with the East of the Island is less clear mainly because of data availability 

limitations.  

The Lages Graben follows the same strike as the SETVR pervasive faulting. In SETVR, 

the faulting pattern seems dominanted by right lateral oblique extension. Faulting on the 

ETVR follows a strike close to the Island fissural system. The observed active 

submarine fissural volcanism is concentrated in a region parallel to the SETVR but 

lying deeper and between this two ridge systems. Furthermore consistent high 

magnetization values and lack of tectonization leeds us to the conclusion that this 

fissural volcanism materializes the neo-volcanic zone in the submarine domain east of

Terceira Island. Linkage of these submarine volcanic occurrences with those of Cinco 

Picos Caldera, fissural system inland, cannot be verified and probably they are a part of 

different accreting segments. 

 

Figure VI.23 -  Summary of main tectonic observations in the study area. Ligth gray contours are 
shallow area. Dark gray contours are deep bathymetric areas. Dash gray lines are axis of negative 
magnetic anomalies considered abandoned accretion units. Short dashed black lines are positive 
magnetic anomalies considered volcanically inactive. T labels refer possible timing sequence for 
activity of those acretion units, where T0 refers to the present day. Black line defines the Terceira 
axis neo-volcanic zone. Long dashed lines mark the SE limit of sector 1 LVR hypotetised as 
corresponding to a relay zone. Stippled lines are possible MAR related reactivated fabrics. Arrows 
indicate interpreted bulk sence of displacement in the fault. West of relay zone, faults probably 
accommodate deformation by deformation partition. East of the limit faults are considered to 
present oblique dextral slip. 

 

Considering these observations, and assuming that the bulk of inter-plate tectonic 

processes are focused in the Terceira axis in this sector, how is accretion accommodated 

in this domain? Is it full seafloor spreading or is intra-oceanic rifting still taking place as 

suggested by Vogt and Jung (2003)? 

 166 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
Existance, both in the Island and in the SETVR of N-S striking fault segments and the 

point source style of volcanism which resulted in the construction of the Island, 

probably at the intersection of tectonic structures (Self, 1976; Lourenço et al., 1998) 

leads us to the conclusion that Terceira axis “basement” can be in fact tectonically 

subsided MAR generated seafloor due to rifting of lithosphere resultant from EU-NU 

plate boundary processes without effective seafloor spreading. We envisage, therefore 

that the extremely slow nature of extension within the Terceira axis, has resulted in 

vertical stacking of volcanic products along main active tectonic trends. The Brunhes 

and Matuyama magnetic anomalies, documented within the Terceira axis would 

represent the last volcanic expression within that system. In this case, the spatial 

arrangement of magnetic anomalies within the Terceira axis, and the main orientation of 

the principal volcano-tectonic features, can provide some clues on the sucession of 

magmatic and tectonic accretion events and their spatial distribution across this plate 

boundary.  

Searle (1980) stated that it was unclear form the studied GLORIA images, if the plate 

boundary corresponded to the topographical highs or lows.  Considering the strike of 

faults imaged on the ETVR subparallel to the Western Terceira Island fissural system 

strike and its overall orientation, we consider that this must have been initially a single 

accreting segment and the older one (See also section II.2.6), probably corresponding to 

reactivation of a MAR transform (axis at T-3 time in Figure VI.23). Magmatic activity 

essentially ceased in Matuyama age. The ER follows the same strike of the ETVR and 

presents a similar magnetic anomaly character suggesting that it has been active during 

the same T-3 period.The timing for ED generation is also unclear. Probably it was 

formed in a recent time (axis at T-2 time?) and active volcanism and minor earthquake 

 167 



 
Chapter VI - Tectonics on the Terceira Island and neighbouring basins 
  
 
activity suggest that is still an active feature, despite never having evolved fully to a an 

acretion axis. Activity then jumped into the SETVR resulting in the construction of this 

ridge by volcanic processes (at T-1 time). Subsquently as extension proceeded volcanic 

processes get focalized in the southeastern edge of the ETVR, materialising the present 

day acretion axis (T0 axis). All the across axis domain, notably the SETVR and ETVR, 

undergo mainly concomintant oblique extension.  

We interpret these clokwise jumps in accretion axis as the result of two conjugate 

factors:  

1) Variations in the thickness of the lithosphere brittle layer. As magmatic processes 

proceed, progressive topography build up and therefore increase in load as well as 

crustal thickness, could lead to a re-organization of the magmatic plumbing system and 

reactivation of subparallel pre-existing structures but in a thinner and weaker brittle 

layer, therefore more favourable to rupture as volcanic conduits 

2) The prevailing kinematic conditions through time. As referred in Chapter IV, the 

extension at this plate boundary has progressively rotated from NE-SW to more E-W 

directions (as constrained respectively by Nuvel-1A and by GPS models). This 

modification of kinematic constraints could have resulted in changement of the tectonic 

regime from right lateral transtension dominated by wrenching, still prevailing in the 

studied western domain to oblique right lateral extension in this eastern domain. In the 

latter with consequent reactivation of NW-SE left lateral faulting directions as oblique 

normal faults. We suggest that the Terceira axis neovolcanic axis, at least in this sector, 

is re-organizing and fitting the current kinematic conditions.

Chapter VII - Geodynamic inferences of 1957-58 Capelinhos Eruption 
(Faial) 

VII.1 Introduction  

Geodetic monuments were installed for the first time on Faial Island in 1937. Fifty years 

later they were reoccupied with triangulation and trilateration and, just before the 9 July 

1998 earthquake, they were once again observed, now with GPS instruments. In spite of 

the significant volcanic and seismic events during this period, a quantitative assessment 

of the Island’s deformation has never been attempted. In this section, we summarise the 

results of re-processing of geodetic data covering a time span of 60 years, to assess the 

long-term deformation pattern of the Island recently presented as a form of a paper 

(Catalão et al., 2006). We show that displacements are large over the western part of 

Faial Island, and mainly limited to the 1937-1967 period; in the eastern part of Faial 

Island the displacement field is below the accuracy threshold of conventional geodetic 

techniques for the whole time span. Most of the Island deformation, as we shall discuss 

below, probably was accommodated in a single event, corresponding to the 1957 

Capelinhos eruption and subsequent earthquake activity. This unique data allows 

constraining the dynamics of active volcanic processes and how they contribute to inter-

plate deformation at the Azores. Its generalization also provides clues on modes of 

growth of the LVR at least for sector 1.  

 169 



 
Chapter VII - Geodynamic inferences of 1957-58 Capelinhos Eruption (Faial) 
 
 

VII.2 The eruption and associated earthquake activity 

Since the arrival of the first settlers, in the early XV century, several aerial eruptions 

have been reported in most of the Islands. Faial Island in particular was the site of a few 

historical eruptions; the last one and the best described is the Capelinhos eruption. This 

eruption started on the 27th of September 1957, 1 km offshore the western tip of Faial 

Island. During about 1 month (until 30 October) intensive explosive activity was 

observed, with uninterrupted emission of bombs and scoria. A small Island was formed, 

built up with tephra and basaltic lapilli reaching 600 m in diameter on the base and a 

height of 80 m above sea level. On the 30th October the explosive volcanic activity 

ceased and the Island collapsed. Subsequent activity led to the construction of an ash 

arc, which reached 150 m height in 1958. Contact between the active chimney and 

seawater was responsible for the high explosive character of the eruption in the first 7 

months of the eruption. There is a large photographic survey and many written 

information concerning this eruption (Castello-Branco et al., 1959, Machado, 1958a, 

1958b, 1959a, 1959b, Machado et al., 1959, Machado et al., 1962, Zbyszewski et al., 

1959). 

On May 13th, 1958, there was a readjustment of the volcanic edifice inducing a seismic 

crisis with more than 450 events recorded. In some places macroseismic intensity 

reached X, in the Modified Mercalli scale (Machado, 1959a). Three source areas were 

identified: one immediately southwest of the central caldera, other northwest, at half 

distance between the caldera and the active crater. The focal depth was estimated by 

Machado (1959a) to be approximately 1 km. A series of fractures was observed with 

subsidence parallel to the N105 cinder cones alignment and uplift along sea cliffs. A 

long narrow belt parallel and along the north side of the cinder cones was depressed 

 170 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
during these crises (Machado et al., 1962). These shallow events had low magnitudes, 

as they were not felt on the SE of Faial (Machado et al., 1962). There are no records of 

these earthquakes because there were no permanent seismographs in the Azores. 

Activity ceased on 24 October 1958. The seismic information is poor: only 3 seismic 

stations were installed in the Azores, one at S. Miguel (since 1902) another at Faial 

(since 1902) and the third at Terceira (since 1932). Faial was inoperative at the time of 

the eruption and a new seismograph was installed at Horta during the crisis. 

Topographic changes were noticed and several surveys conducted to evaluate their 

magnitude (Machado et al., 1959). Most of the measurements were limited to the 

Capelinhos area and devoted to volume computation. Machado et al. (1962) describes 

significant height changes in the south and west of the Island as a result of whole event. 

Changes reached 0.5 m uplift in Vale Formoso (see site VFOR on figure VII.1 for 

location) and 1.5 m subsidence along pre-existing faults, in the central area of Faial. 

Some quantitative data referred by Machado et al. (1962) point to a relative 

displacement of about 1.2 m between north and south side of west of Faial and surface 

movements were considered irregular better describing a warping movement than a 

single graben subsidence. 

VII.3 Geodetic Data 

Geodetic observations on the Azores have been carried out since 1937 by the 

Portuguese Geographic Institute (IGP). Their network covers the whole of Faial and 

Pico Islands. It consists of 135 monuments – 62 in Faial and 73 in Pico - forming a 2-3 

km triangular mesh (see Figure VII.1).

Figure VII.1 - Location of Faial Island in the Azores Archipelago. Faial is the western Island of the 
central group that is closest to the Mid-Atlantic Rift. The Capelinhos volcano is located on the coast 
in the westernmost part of the Island. Geodetic network on Faial and Pico (triangles), directions 
and azimuth between Faial and Pico measured in 1937 and Electronic Distance measurements 
(EDM) made in 1967. 

 

This network was built in 1937- 1942. It is based on well-cemented pillars, about 1.2 m 

high, set firmly into the ground. The network covers the whole surface almost uniformly 

with a local cluster around the Faial summit crater. The network has been surveyed to 

the best available standards of the time in six different operations since 1937, as shown 

in Table VII.1.  

Five different types of observations were made: triangulation, trilateration, azimuth, 

levelling and GPS. Two global occupations have been made, in 1937-1942 and 1995-

1997, giving a time span of about 60 years between the first, made with traditional 

methods, and the second, with GPS. In Faial, intermediate observations were made in 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
1967, with several distances measured with an electro-optical device; in the 1987 

campaign, the Faial geodetic network was almost completely observed with directions 

and zenith distances (planimetry and altimetry). 

Catalão et al. (2006) evaluated triangulation, trilateration and GPS measurements 

obtained in the Islands of Faial and Pico between 1937 and 1997 and estimated the total 

displacement field for a set of 58 points well distributed over both Islands. Their full 

data exploration strategy and processing schemes description is out from the scope of 

this work, for more details the reader is refered to Catalão et al. (2006). Here we only 

present a brief summary of this topic:  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Table VII.1 – Observation epochs and number of geodetic observations. 

To integrate all existing geodetic data and to derive the most reliable deformation field 

for the Capelinhos eruption, Catalão et al. performed the analysis in three steps. First, 

for each epoch and each Island, they obtained the geodetic parameters (coordinates) 

loosely constrained to the MMOC site from terrestrial observations and GPS data. 

Second, he compared distance observations made in 1967 with computed distances 

 173 



 
Chapter VII - Geodynamic inferences of 1957-58 Capelinhos Eruption (Faial) 
 
 
derived from single epoch solutions constraining the deformation process in time. In the 

third and last step, loosely constrained single epoch surveys were combined into a single 

solution which general constraints in position and velocity were imposed, reducing all 

observations and parameters into a uniform reference frame.  

The projected distances were compared with the computed distances derived from each 

single-epoch network adjustment and are presented in Figure VII.2 as a function of 

time. Distance measurements made in 1967 at some sites on Faial, show large baseline 

variations before 1967 and moderate or null variations after that, suggesting no 

systematic trends related to any secular relative deformation between these sites. The 

main ground deformation is confined to the period 1937-1967 and is most probably the 

result of the Capelinhos eruption and associated volcanic and tectonic ground 

deformation processes. In this case, derived site velocities may be interpreted as mean 

velocities integrated over time, and as a consequence are dependent on the chosen 

interval range.

length was measured with AGA-6A in 1967 and was computed from site positions for the 1937, 
1995 and 1997 campaigns (Catalão et al., 2006). 

 174

The leveling data used in this study was collected in 1937 and in 1987 for Faial Island. 

No leveling data was used on Pico Island. Orthometric heights were determined purely 

by trigonometric heighting for most of the geodetic vertices. The starting point was the 

MMOC site with its known true orthometric height determined by conventional 

differential levelling from the tide gauge. A set of 36 sites are common in both epochs 

and the vertical deformation was computed for each site, from which a vertical 

deformation contour map was derived and presented in Figure VII.3.   

 

Figure VII.3- Vertical deformation obtained from 1937 and 1987 epochs (Catalão et al., 2006) 

 

The first thing to note from this map is the almost perfect agreement between 

neighboring sites producing an almost smooth surface, and showing a high spatial 

coherence of these movements. Moreover, the results are in agreement with Machado et 

 175 



 
Chapter VII - Geodynamic inferences of 1957-58 Capelinhos Eruption (Faial) 
 
 
al. (1962) for the west side of Faial, revealing a large depressed area from the summit 

crater that reaches a maximum of -1.75 m vertical displacement at the FAJA site, and on 

the south coast a vertical uplift of about 0.5 m at the COEL site. From the north flank of 

the Faial crater spanning the entire north coast of Faial, a vertical uplift of 1.0 m is 

observed with a maximum of 1.5 m on the north crater flanks. 

Finally, the single-epoch observations were integrated by Catalão et al. (2006) into a 

multi-temporal adjustment to derive the deformation field in the period 1937-

1997.There are two possible intervals: 1937 to 1987, with only conventional geodetic 

data, and 1937 to 1997 with conventional geodetic data and GPS. Catalão et al. 

processed both periods and two sets of displacements were derived, corresponding to 

the 1987 and 1997 epochs. Both solutions were compared and it was found that residual 

displacements between them were within the 95% confidence error ellipses. In Figure 

VII.4, the computed displacement for the 1937-1987 period with 95% confidence 

interval ellipses is depicted. This period has more common sites than 1937-1997 due to 

the network reconstruction in 1997. 

It is important to note that the resulting displacement field for the Faial-Pico network 

has been found in the joint solution of conventional and GPS geodetic observations in a 

frame of reference attached to the MMOC site in the south-east of Faial Island, which 

was strongly constrained in position and velocity in the adjustment of the geodetic 

network. This was the only strong constraint. This means that the computed 

displacements between 1937 and 1987 are relative to the MMOC site.

networks. Error ellipses are computed with a 95% confidence interval (Catalão et al., 2006). 

 

VII.4 Elastic modelling  

To model the observed geodetic displacements it was assumed that ground deformation 

was elastic and caused by the intrusion of two sub-vertical dikes in-depth. Dyke 

emplacement was simulated by a set of rectangular tensile dislocation sources in an 

elastic, homogeneous and isotropic half-space (Okada, 1985). The medium is assumed 

to have rigidity equal to 30 GPa. Inversion was made using the non linear generalized 

inverse algorithm developed by Briole et al. (1986), which allows the estimation of fault 

and slip parameters that best fit geodetic data. We first used field data reported by 

Machado et al. (1962). For the inversion, all three components of the displacements 

were used. The parameters for each rectangular dislocation model are length, width, 



 
Chapter VII - Geodynamic inferences of 1957-58 Capelinhos Eruption (Faial) 
 
 
strike and geographic location of the centre of dislocation plane at its top, as well as dip-

slip, strike-slip and opening dislocations. The reference surface is considered to be sea-

level.

Initial fault parameters were based in Machado et al. (1962) descriptions of the May 

1958 seismic crisis. In the inversion process we constrained the geometry of the 

dislocations sources to follow the surface traces of eruptive fissures and invert for their 

geometry, kinematic solutions and location. Four plane sources were used. Fault planes 

 178 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
laying along the fissural system west of the summit caldera were constrained to be 

essentially pure opening; the other two fault planes sub-parallel to the previous ones, 

located north and south of the system were constrained respectively as dominantly 

normal fault dipping south, with a minor right lateral shear component, and dominantly 

normal fault, dipping northward, with a minor left lateral component. These can be 

viewed as the collapse of the caldera, corresponding to the May 1958 seismic crises. 

Source parameters obtained from inversion are presented in Table VII.2 and their 

projection on the horizontal plane is shown in figure VII.5.  

Reduced chi-square was determined from the network adjustment (12 cm for the 

horizontal components). The ? 2 / n values obtained after adjustment were 0.98 

assuming the aforementioned uncertainties. A misfit of 1.0 indicates that the data errors 

are statistically consistent with the residuals. In this case the goodness of the fit is very 

promising and we have a reduced chi square almost equal to 1 considering the a 

posteriori 12 cm standard deviation for latitude and longitude displacement components. 

The mean square error for the best fitting model is 14.5 cm in longitude and 13.8 in 

latitude, implying there is still un-modelled signal. This model explains 94% of the 

planimetric displacement but only 42% of the vertical displacement. The misfit is 

scattered throughout the network, showing residual local vertical displacements that we 

interpret as block falling that cannot be modelled by a simple elastic model. The model 

fits the summit and northwest subsidence rather well and also the large horizontal 

displacements along the coast. However, it underpredicts the uplift on the north flank.

Figure VII.5 - Map of the displacements obtained from the measured geodetic network (directions 
and distances). Blue arrows are the observed displacements and the red arrows are the 
displacements computed from the forward rectangular source model with four rupturing elements. 

 

The horizontal displacements show rapid seaward displacement in the north and south 

flanks with a scattered behavior over the caldera. The greatest displacements occur 

along the north coast. The velocity pattern around the summit is clearly influenced by a 

local source of deformation displacing all summit points to the west. This pattern is 

consistent with a dike intrusion near the summit caldera. Stations on the north flank 

show significant uplift of about 1 m. There is a dramatic decrease in the displacements 

in the south-east of Faial that correlates well with the normal fault system of Flamengos 

graben. The displacements in this region and on Pico Island are almost within the 

confidence error ellipses, indicating a non-deformated area consistent with the 

trilateration observations made in 1967 and the GPS observations from 1997. In fact the 

 180 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
eruption and the subsequent seismic crises did not affect either the east of Faial nor Pico 

Island. 

Most of the deformation is spatially constrained to the central and western zones of 

Faial Island. Northern and western stations have average displacements of 1.5 m 

(relative to MMOC), while stations on eastern Faial and Pico show no significant 

relative motion. It is known (Machado et al., 1962) that the eruption and associated 

seismic crises were hardly felt in Pico, this is confirmed by the geodetic data therefore 

no significant deformation has affected Pico Island since 1937. 

Vertical displacements show subsidence of the north-west zone with a maximum of -1.5 

m and coastal uplift on the south-west zone with a maximum of 0.5 m. This uplift along 

the south coast constrains the fault position and argues in favour of normal faulting 

along this fault. There are three stations with significant subsidence along the north-

west coast. 

As we have only a few occupation epochs during the whole time span we cannot 

completely discriminate the time variation of the displacement field. However, we know 

that displacements were smaller than the accuracy of conventional geodetic techniques 

during the 1967-97 period, and also that the magnitude of the displacements deduced 

from our work agree well with the independent measures presented by Machado et al. 

(1962) for the deformation generated by the 1957-58 events. We can conclude that 

surface displacement observed between 1937 and 1997 is mainly a consequence of a 

single series of events related to the Capelinhos dyke emplacement event and related 

eruption as suggested by our modeling procedure.

Chapter VIII - Physical models of rifting and transform faulting in a 
wedge-shape lithosphere 

VIII.1 Introduction 

Most of the physical processes that must be evoked to support tectonic interpretations in 

the Azores are not well understood as in the case of rifting and transform fault 

generation. In the Azores mantle processes which contribute for the formation of rifting 

in the Terceira axis and transform fault generation can be driven both by plates 

divergent spreading and by the Azores Hot Spot dynamics in space and time. As this 

interaction between the Azores Hot Spot and Azores lithosphere is not yet fully 

understood, physical modelling as shall be presented bellow is a usefull tool to provide 

constraints on the relevance of some of those factors. In this chapter we disregard plume 

related mantle processes and foccus our attention in ridge push as a driving force for 

ortogonal transform fault generation and for spreading to occur. 

The way in which mantle processes contribute to plate tectonics has long been a subject 

for debate. After more than 30 years of studies of oceanic ridges, several objections 

were raised to the early views in which plate motions are fundamentally a result of 

mantle convection (Cox &amp;amp; Hart, 1986) and lithospheric plates ride passively on a 

moving asthenosphere. Molnar (1988) considered that flow in the asthenosphere is no 

 183 



 
Chapter VIII – Physical Models of rifting and transform faulting in a wedge shaped lithosphere   
 
 
more than a trigger for plate motion. Davies (1992) suggested that plates govern the 

flow and that they are integral parts of the convection process. More radically, Stüwe 

(2002) calculated that differential stresses at the base of the lithosphere are too small to 

transmit forces from the asthenospheric mantle to the lithosphere. On petrologic 

arguments, he also concluded that the ascending paths of convective cells are not 

directly under oceanic ridges. 

There is growing support for the idea that tectonic plates are active components of 

global convection. According to this view, plate tectonics are an example of self-

organization (Anderson, 2001 and 2002), whereby forces at the edges of plates directly 

influence processes in the convecting mantle. The recognized forces are ridge push, slab 

pull, trench suction and basal drag (see Turcotte and Schubert, 1982). Balancing them 

are shearing, slab bending, friction on transform faults, and continental collision (e.g. 

Forsyth and Uyeda, 1975; Richter, 1977; Chapple and Tullis, 1977, Cox &amp;amp; Hart, 1986, 

Favela and Anderson, 2000). 

First order oceanic transform faults tend to be geometrically simple; on the whole they 

are parallel to plate motions, disturbed only by significant changes in kinematic 

conditions (Fox and Gallo 1984 and 1986; Carbotte and Macdonald, 1994; Hey et al., 

1995). Non-transform discontinuities also exist, but they are ephemeral, and result from 

local interactions (MacDonald, 1986 and 1988; Grindlay et al, 1991; Grindlay and Fox, 

1993).  Transform faults that strike at 90º to adjacent ridge segments are common in 

nature, for example in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge south of the Azores, the Hayes and 

Oceanograper Fracture Zones display such a configuration. Within the ATJ domain, 

there are no clear first order transform linked with the Eu-Af plate boundary, however 

we have here presented reported co-seismic ruptures in orthogonal planes, as shown by 

 184 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
Faial 1998 earthquake, and orthogonal geometrical relations is fault patterns namely in 

the East of Terceira Island and adjoining North Hirondelle Basin or across the LVR 

sectors. These geometrical relations are not accountable from classical theories of 

fracture mechanics.  

In this chapter, we investigate the structures that are formed in ridges, straight or offset. 

The presence of a heavy wedge-shaped lithosphere above a buoyant asthenosphere leads 

to isostatic compensation, forming ridges and abyssal plains. The topography of the 

ridge results in ridge push. This is a driving force for extension on the ridge, as well as 

for transform motion at ridge offsets. 

VIII.2 Background on physical models of ridges and transform faults 

Physical modelling has been successful to some extent in reproducing ridges and 

transform faults. Oldenburg and Brune (1972, 1975) obtained good likenesses, using 

paraffin wax as a model material. They concluded that equivalent structures in nature 

result from tensile forces that originate through buoyancy forces acting in plates, rather 

than through underlying viscous drag.  

O’Bryan et al., (1975) published results based on the wax model of Oldenburg and 

Brune, and the Cox “tennis ball experiment” (Cox, 1973).  They produced realistic ridge 

and transform geometries and suggested that transform faults orthogonal to the ridge 

would result from upward propagation of a zigzag pattern at the base of the lithosphere 

or top of the asthenosphere. Ragnarsson et al. (1996) used similar wax models to 

address ridge dynamics and structure. They concluded that, above a critical spreading 

velocity, a transient segmented ridge and orthogonal fracture zones form.

Shemenda and Grocholsky (1991, 1994) used a wax-like hydrocarbon, forcibly cooled 

from above, to simulate both melt and a semi-brittle upper layer subject to horizontal 

tension.  In their experiments, a ridge resulted from an unstable, non-stationary and 

asymmetric three-dimensional process. They were not able to produce orthogonal 

transform faults, but rather transfer zones, which grew in width or ceased to be active as 

a function of adjacent ridge dynamics.  

Dauteuil and Brun (1993) used analogue models consisting of brittle and ductile layers 

to study the structural pattern of the highly oblique Mohns Ridge. Mart and Dauteuil 

(2000) used similar layers, isostatically compensated, to model obliquely rifting 

systems. In both sets of experiments, the resulting fault pattern included en-echelon 

ridges, normal to the extension direction, and intervening zones of oblique strike slip. 

Mauduit and Dauteuil (1996a and 1996b) and Dauteuil et al., (2002), using isostatically 

compensated two-layer models of sand and silicone putty, altered the lithospheric 

strength in the transform zone. The resulting fault zones were narrow, when the 

lithosphere was strong; and wider and more complex, when the lithosphere was weak. 

In nature, Dauteuil et al. (2002) concluded that spreading rates and offset lengths are the 

main factors controlling lithospheric strength at transform faults.  

Tentler (2003) used centrifuged models, in which up-rise of lighter and weaker ductile 

material (an analogue for the asthenosphere) promoted passive rifting in an overlying 

brittle layer. In some experiments, propagating cracks interfered longitudinally and 

developed into “overlapping spreading centres”. Tentler (2003) suggested that such 

overlap might lead to orthogonal ridge-transform configurations in true mid-oceanic 

ridges.

Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
None of the above analogue modelling strategies has focussed specifically on the 

interplay between gravitational forces, rifting and the generation of transform faults 

between offset spreading segments. To do so we must investigate the problem by means 

of physical models in which the driving forces for the development of axial rifts are 

gravitational in origin. They come from density jumps at a dipping interface, rather than 

from a convecting mantle. Although in nature the role of heat is essential, in that it 

governs the thickness of a cooling lithosphere, we do not model its conduction or 

advection. Instead, we assume that, as a result of cooling and spreading, the lithosphere 

is a wedge of small apical angle. We test the mechanical response of such a wedge and 

then of an offset between ridge segments. In some experiments, the offset is purely 

geometrical, whereas in others we have reduced the frictional resistance by using 

artificially embedded faults. The underlying question is, can gravitational forces explain 

the common occurrence of major oceanic transform faults, which are orthogonal to 

adjacent ridge segments? 

VIII.3 Dynamics of a spreading oceanic lithosphere 

The oceanic lithosphere can be considered as a thermal boundary layer and its base as 

an isotherm. To calculate the shapes of isotherms, we follow Turcotte and Schubert 

(2002): if the oceanic lithosphere cools in the same way as a semi-infinite half-space, its 

temperature at a time t is given by (Turcotte and Schubert, 1982, equation 4-113, page 

160): 

(T – Tm)/(Tm – Ts) = erf {z/2(? t)1/2}       (1) 

In equation (1), the terms on the left and right are dimensionless, T is the current 

temperature at the base of the lithosphere, Tm is the temperature deep in the 

 187 



 
Chapter VIII – Physical Models of rifting and transform faulting in a wedge shaped lithosphere   
 
 
asthenosphere (in other words, the original temperature, before cooling), Ts is the 

surface temperature (which we assume to be constant), z is the depth (in mm), ? is the 

thermal diffusivity (in mm2 s-1), t is the age of the lithosphere (in s), and erf is the error 

function. 

If the lithospheric wedge moves at a steady velocity u in a horizontal direction x, then t 

= x/u and equation (1) becomes the parametric equation of a parabola (Figure VIII.1). 

For Tm-Ts = 1200 ºK, u = 3 cm/yr and ? = 1 mm2 s-1, the lithospheric segment that 

formed between 10 Ma and 35 Ma is up to 86 km thick and has an average basal slope 

of about 3º. As the lithosphere moves away from the ridge, it cools, and its density ? 

increases in the following way (Turcotte and Schubert 1982, equation 4-173, page 179): 

??  = ? ? ? d?          (2) 

Here ?? is the volumetric coefficient of thermal expansion. For an initial mantle density 

of ?m = 3.3 x 103 kg m-3, a constant coefficient of ?  = 3 x 10-5 °K-1, an initial 

temperature of 1480 °K, and a final temperature of 280 °K, the final lithospheric density 

is ?l ? 3.4 x 103 kg m-3. 

As the lithosphere becomes heavier, it requires support. If isostatic compensation occurs 

in the asthenosphere, the theoretical depth w of the ocean is (Turcotte and Schubert, 

1982, equation 4-202, page 182): 

w = 2 ?µ ? {(?m ? ??)/(?m ?  ?w)}  (?x/? u) 1/2      (3) 

Here ?w is the density of seawater. According to this equation, the depth of the ocean 

increases with the square root of the distance from the ridge axis. The result is in good 

agreement with most observations.

Figure VIII.1 - Thickness of oceanic lithosphere in nature and experiment. In nature (top), 
isotherms are for cooling of an infinite half-space (Turcotte and Schubert, 2002), moving at 3 cm/yr. 
Base of lithosphere is at 1400ºK. Segment of triangle (grey polygon) is approximation to true shape, 
for lithosphere between 10 Ma and 35 Ma. Basal slope is 3°. In experiment (bottom), sand has same 
triangular shape and basal slope. 

 

The elevation of the ridge establishes a pressure head, or ridge push, which drives 

horizontal motion of the lithosphere. The process can be thought of as gravitational 

sliding. The lithospheric plate slides downward along the slope between the ridge crest 

and the adjoining ocean basin. By assuming that the weight of the lithosphere causes 

equal horizontal and vertical stresses (in other words, a true pressure) and by balancing 

the horizontal forces, we may predict the ridge push (Turcotte and Schubert, 1982). It is 

the resultant of three forces (F1, F2 and F3, Figure VIII.2A). The first (F1) results from 

pressure in the asthenosphere and is equal to the depth-integrated pressure (F5) acting on 

a vertical plane. The second (F2) results from pressure in seawater and is similarly equal 

to a depth-integrated pressure (F4). The third (F3) is due to the weight of the lithosphere.

Figure VIII.2 - Theoretical subsidence and ridge push in nature and experiment. In nature (A), 
subsidence w is due to variable thickness (yL) and density (?L) of lithosphere, as well as density of 
seawater (?W) and asthenosphere (?A). Ridge push is resultant of horizontal forces (F1, F2 and F3) 
acting on lithosphere. In experiment (B), air replaces seawater, lithosphere is triangular segment of 
sand, and asthenosphere is of PDMS. Subsidence equals one half of lithospheric thickness. Ridge 
push is resultant of horizontal forces (Fl and Fa) acting on lithosphere. For further details, see text.  

 

The resultant ridge push F on the lithosphere becomes (Turcotte and Schubert, 1982, 

equation 6-376, page 288):  

F  = g ?m ? (?m ? ??) {1 + 2 ?m ? (?m ? ??)/ ? (?m ? ?w)} ?t    (4) 

 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
Here g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m s-2). According to equation (4), the 

ridge push is directly proportional to the horizontal distance from the ridge axis, and 

therefore to the age of the lithosphere. For a density of water of ?w = 1.0 x 103 kg m-3, a 

temperature difference of 1200 °K, and values of the other parameters as before, the 

total ridge push on an oceanic lithosphere, which is 100 Ma old, is ca. 3.8 x 1012 N m-1 

(Turcotte and Schubert, 1982, page 288). This is a force per unit length, parallel to the 

ridge. On a lithosphere that has moved at 3 cm/yr for a distance of 1050 km, so that it is 

35 Ma old, the ridge push is ca. 1.4 x 1012 N m-1.  

If the only stress that balances the ridge push is a horizontal shear stress, acting on an 

area (1050 km by 1 m) at the base of the lithosphere, its magnitude is ca. 1.3 x 106 Pa. If 

the viscosity of the asthenosphere is 1020 Pa s (Turcotte and Schubert, 1982), the 

corresponding rate of shear beneath the lithosphere is ca. 1.3 x 10-14 s-1. If the plate 

velocity is 3 cm/year (ca. 1 x 10-9 m s-1), and if this attenuates linearly with depth, it 

must do so down to at least 130 km. As this depth is conservative for the asthenosphere, 

we conclude that the ridge push is sufficient to cause plate motion. Any excess ridge 

push is available for causing a longitudinal stress gradient in the lithosphere or for 

driving strike-slip motion on transform faults. 

VIII.4 Model configurations and scaling 

All the experiments (except Model B) were done in a wooden box, 2300 mm long, 500 

mm wide and 150 mm deep (Figure VIII.3). Thin sheets of transparent polyester 

(Mylar) covered the walls. At the two ends of the model were motor-driven L-shaped 

pistons, 90 mm high and 500 mm wide. They rested and could slide on end walls, 60 

mm high and 1500 mm apart.  

 191

Figure VIII.3 - Experimental configuration (in schematic oblique view). Models consist of only one 
spreading ridge (A), or of two spreading ridges (B) and one orthogonal vertical offset (VO). Model 
lithosphere (sand) rests on model asthenosphere (PDMS). 

 

The model materials were (1) dry quartz sand from Fontainebleau, France, for the 

lithosphere and (2) transparent silicone polymer, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), for the 

asthenosphere. These materials are readily available and their properties are well 

known. The sand yields according to Coulomb criterion: the angle of internal friction is 

about 40° and the cohesion is negligible (see Mourgues and Cobbold, 2003). The PDMS 

is a Newtonian fluid and its viscosity is about 104 Pa s.  

Our models took no account of heat advection, thermal contraction, or consequent 

variations in density. Instead, the density of the model lithosphere was constant, as was 

that of the model asthenosphere. The density of the sand was approximately 1.5 x 103 

 192 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
kg m-3 and that of the PDMS was about 1.0 x 103 kg m-3. Thus the density ratio was 1.5 

- far greater in the models, than it is in nature. As we shall see later, this high viscosity 

ratio led to abnormally high values of isostatic subsidence and ridge push. 

We did seven experiments, in two basic layouts: (1) a single symmetric ridge with no 

offset (models A, C and D; Table VIII.1 and Figure VIII.3A), and (2) two ridge 

segments, trending N-S and offset E-W, with or without an embedded fault (models E, 

F and G; Table VIII.1 and Figure VIII.3B).

We adopted a model ratio of length, Lr = Lm / Ln that was nominally equal to 7 x 10-7 

(Table VIII.2, Figure VIII.1). From nature to model, all stresses necessarily scaled down 

by a factor of ?r = ?r Lr. Taking ?r ? 0.45 for the lithosphere, and Lr ? 7 x 10-7, we obtain 

a stress ratio of ?r ? 3.2 x 10-7. In nature, the viscosity of the asthenosphere is of the 

order of µ = 1020 Pa s. As the viscosity of the PDMS is of the order of 104 Pa s, the 

viscosity ratio for our experiments was ?µr = 10-16. From this and the stress ratio, the time 

 193 



 
Chapter VIII – Physical Models of rifting and transform faulting in a wedge shaped lithosphere   
 
 
ratio was tr ? 3.1 x 10-10 (1 second in an experiment was equivalent to about 100 years 

in nature; 100 hours were equivalent to about 37 Ma).Thus the velocity ratio was ur = 

Lr/tr ? 2.3 x 103 (0.13 mm/minute in an experiment were equivalent to 3 cm/year in 

nature). Finally, because ridge push has dimensions of N m-1, its model ratio, in 

principle, was Fr = ?r Lr ? 2.2 x 10-13. In practice, the ridge push was abnormally high in 

the models, as will be explained later.

VIII.4.1 Models of straight ridges 

To make these models, first the PDMS surface was shaped into a single linear 

symmetric ridge (Figure VIII.3A). The height of the PDMS was 100 mm at the ridge 

axis and it decreased linearly to 60 mm at the end walls. A layer of Fontainebleau quartz 

sand was laid over the PDMS and its upper surface was scraped horizontal. The 

thickness of the sand wedge was therefore ca. 55 mm against the pistons and ca. 15 mm 

at the ridge axis (except in models C and D, where it was ca. 20 mm and 10 mm, 

respectively). The model wedge, on each side of the ridge, was 750 mm long and 500 

mm wide, representing a prototype wedge that was 1050 km long, 700 km wide and up 

to 86 km thick. In cross-section, the wedge was triangular and its apical angle was close 

 194 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
to 3°. This was a simplification that made it easier to construct the models. The 

underlying PDMS represented an asthenosphere, 164 km deep. 

In a matter of minutes after construction the shape of the model changed as a result of 

isostatic compensation. At the axis, where the heavy lithosphere was relatively thin, the 

upper surface rose. On the flanks, where the lithosphere was thicker, it sank. However, 

at the lateral boundaries, the lithosphere did not move, because it was in dry frictional 

contact with the sidewalls and end walls.  Nowhere did the model asthenosphere have 

the opportunity to extrude, as a result of the pressure that the heavy lithosphere exerted 

upon it. 

For ideal isostatic compensation of a perfectly triangular wedge, the subsidence w is 

directly proportional to the thickness h of the model lithosphere and to the density ratio: 

w/ h = ?l/?a ? 1          (5) 

In a perfectly triangular wedge, where the density is 1.5 x 103 kg m-3 for the lithosphere 

and 1.0 x 103 kg m-3 for the asthenosphere, the theoretical subsidence is one half of the 

lithospheric thickness. In our models, which were segments of triangular wedges, the 

theoretical subsidence was w ? 27.5 mm at the far end, and w ? 7.5 mm at the near end 

(Figure VIII.2B). Thus the theoretical relief was 20 mm, representing an abnormal value 

of almost 30 km in nature.  

In a perfectly triangular wedge, the ridge push F is equal to the difference between the 

vertically integrated pressures in the asthenosphere (Fa) and the lithosphere (Fl): 

F  =  Fa - Fl  =  g ?a?? h + w  z dz - g ?l ??? h  z dz  = (g/2){?a (h + w)2 - ?l h2}   (6) 

 195 



 
Chapter VIII – Physical Models of rifting and transform faulting in a wedge shaped lithosphere   
 
 
Substituting equation (5) into equation (6), we obtain, for the theoretical ridge push on a 

triangular wedge: 

F  = (g/2) (?l /?a) (?l ? ?a) h2         (7) 

For the same densities as before and for a wedge segment, the ends of which are 55 mm 

and 15 mm thick, the estimated ridge push at the far end is ca. 10.3 N m-1. However, in 

our models it may have been smaller than that, because sidewall friction impeded full 

isostatic compensation. 

Because ridge push has dimensions of N m-1, it should scale down by a factor of Fr = ?r 

Lr ? 2.2 x 10-13. As the ridge push in the prototype is ca. 1.4 x 1012 N m-1, in the model it 

should have been ca. 0.3 N m-1. The estimated value (10.3 N m-1) was about 30 times 

greater, partly because of the triangular shape of the model lithosphere, but mainly 

because of the abnormal density contrast and consequent topographic relief. 

VIII.4.2 Models of offset ridges 

In the second layout (models E, F and G), the ridge was offset vertically and 

orthogonally (Figure VIII.3B). To construct the models, the PDMS surface was shaped 

into two N-S ridges. The amount of offset was 300 mm. The ridges were asymmetric, 

the apical angles being ca. 2.2º for the short flank and ca. 5º for the long flank. These 

dimensions were for convenience in constructing the models. However, they meant that 

the lithospheric thickness was over-estimated on the short flanks and underestimated on 

the long flanks. 

There were three variants to the layout (Figure VIII.4). 

In Model E, there was a vertical offset, but no embedded fault (Figure VIII.4A). 

 196 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
In Model F, there was an embedded fault, consisting of two Mylar sheets and an 

intervening thin glass plate (Figure VIII.4B). The Mylar sheets spanned the distance 

(300 mm) between the two ridge segments. Downward, they penetrated no more than 5 

mm into the PDMS. Upward, they reached into the sand as much as 5 mm above the 

ridges. The glass plate was also 300 mm long, but it reached the bottom of the box. 

In Model G, there was an embedded fault, consisting of two longer Mylar sheets, but no 

intervening glass plate. One end of each sheet was at a ridge axis, whereas the other end 

went well beyond the other ridge axis (Figure VIII.4C). Between the ridges, the Mylar 

sheets were in mutual contact, whereas beyond the ridges they were in contact with 

PDMS or sand. 

The Mylar sheets were in dry frictional contact, with each other (Model G), with the 

glass plate (Model F) and with the sand. Although for these contacts we did not measure 

the frictional resistances, we observed that they were less than the internal friction of the 

sand. In contrast, all materials adhered strongly to the PDMS. In Model F, the glass 

plate rendered the embedded fault inflexible. 

In a matter of minutes after construction, the shape of the model changed, as a result of 

isostatic compensation. At the ridge axes, where the heavy lithosphere was relatively 

thin, the upper surface rose. On the flanks, where the lithosphere was thicker, it 

subsided. At the lateral boundaries, the lithosphere did not move, because it was in dry 

frictional contact with the sidewalls and end walls. For similar reasons, uplift was less 

pronounced along the trace of the ridge offset, than it was on the ridges or their 

immediate flanks.

Figure VIII.4 - Three initial kinds of transform fault in models (top views and side views). In Model 
E ridge has vertical offset and there is no embedded fault (A). In Model F, embedded fault consists 
of two flexible Mylar sheets and one intervening thin glass plate (B). In Model G, Mylar sheets 
extend beyond offset and there is no glass plate (C). All interfaces are in dry frictional contact, 
except against PDMS.  

 

VIII.5 Experimental results 

VIII.5.1 Model A. Half-ridge, unconfined gliding, sidewall friction (Figure VIII.5). 

In Model A, the lithosphere consisted of a single ridge flank. As long as the end walls 

provided confinement, the lithosphere did not move. However, when the experimenter 

removed part of the wall, at the far end of the box, the lithosphere glided down slope. 

As a result, normal faults formed in the axial region (Figure VIII.5). However, the sand 

was in dry frictional contact with the plastic sidewalls and the PDMS adhered to them 

strongly. This lateral resistance resulted in shear zones, containing Riedel faults. 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
To reduce the sidewall friction, we fixed four Mylar sheets (Mylar 1, Figure VIII.6) to 

the end walls, in such a way that they ran along the sidewalls. Another four Mylar 

sheets (Mylar 2) were fixed to the sidewalls, but in lower positions, so that they partly 

overlapped the upper sheets. On withdrawing the end walls and the attached upper 

Mylar sheets at a constant rate of 20 mm/hr, we found that no shear zones developed 

against the sidewalls. 

VIII.5.2 Model B. Unconfined gliding, no sidewall friction. 

Model B was built outside the apparatus, on a rigid plate dipping at 3°. The model 

consisted of a triangular wedge of sand, resting on a layer of PDMS, 3 cm thick. All 

lateral boundaries were free. Under its own weight, the lithosphere glided down slope. 

The experiment lasted one hour. 

The upper part of the model glided slowly, whereas the lower part glided more rapidly. 

As a result, the entire model was subject to extension. The velocity at a point in the 

centre of the model increased slowly, up to a value of about 120 mm/hour (Figure 

VIII.7). 

VIII.5.3 Models C and D. Straight ridges, confined gliding, limited sidewall friction 

In models C and D, a piston moving at 10 mm/hour limited the rate of gliding of the 

model lithosphere. The result of gliding was extension in the ridge axis (Figure VIII.8). 

When the extension had reached 1%, an axial rift formed. To avoid the PDMS welling 

up unduly and to simulate the formation of oceanic crust by cooling, we deposited thin 

layers of sand episodically in the axial rift. The thickness of this sand exerted a strong 

control on the development of extensional faults in the axial rift.

In Model C, the thickness of sand in the axial rift did not exceed 10 mm (Figure VIII.8). 

Extensional faults were irregular in strike and they were not sharp. Early faults soon 

became inactive and new faults took over from them, but the pattern remained irregular. 

In Model D, the thickness of sand in the axial rift reached 20 mm. Extensional faults 

were sharper and more regular in strike. The amount of slip on the faults was also 

greater. In the early stages of deformation, two major faults were active, defining a 

valley. Later, these faults rafted out and became inactive. New faults formed on the 

ridge axis, where the extension concentrated. Thus the final result was a series of 

parallel normal faults, of which only the innermost ones were active.

VIII.5.4 Model E. Offset ridge, no embedded fault  

In model E the ridge was offset laterally by 300 mm. However, there was no embedded 

fault. As before, normal faults formed along the axis of each ridge segment (Figure 

VIII.9). Normal faults propagated towards the offset trace (OT), curving into it, and 

parallel to the topographic gradient. A broad transform zone (TZ) developed. Initially, 

the zone contained two left-lateral Riedel faults, at 17° to the offset trace. These 

developed into normal faults, bounding oblique transform valleys. At ca. 0.7% of axial 

extension, a left-lateral strike-slip fault formed almost at right angles to the ridge axis 

(arrow, Figure VIII.9). However, the entire transform zone continued to be active and it 

remained oblique to the offset trace. The structures were typical of a trantensional 

context and did not resemble a sharp transform fault, as occurs in nature.

VIII.5.5 Model F. Offset ridge, rigid planar embedded fault (Figure VIII.10). 

In Model F, the embedded fault consisted of two Mylar sheets and an intervening glass 

plate. The fault was therefore rigid and inflexible, but it allowed slip. At ca. 5.1%, 6% 

and 7.2% of axial extension, sand was added to depressions in the transform zone 

(Figure VIII.10). 

In the initial stages of the experiment, two axial rifts formed, as before. However, this 

time the rifts propagated as far as the offset trace, remaining straight. At about 0.6% of 

axial extension, a narrow transform zone appeared, on one side of the offset trace, and at 

about 79º to the ridge axis. It contained two left-lateral faults. At about 5% of axial 

extension, the southern fault propagated eastward, intersecting the outer bounding fault 

of the axial rift (arrow 1, Figure VIII.9), whilst the northern fault splayed and 

propagated westward. A pure left-lateral strike-slip fault (arrow 2, Figure VIII.9) cut 

across the transform zone. At ca. 6.7% extension, a new oblique-slip fault (left-lateral 

normal) formed on the northern side of the transform zone (arrow, Figure VIII.9, 6.7% 

extension). Thus the transform zone became straighter, but it remained oblique to the 

offset trace. Again, the structures were typical of trantension, as in Model E.  

VIII.5.6 Model G. Transform with long flexible embedded fault 

In Model G, the embedded fault consisted of two Mylar sheets but no glass plate. The 

fault was therefore inextensible but flexible. 

 In the early stages of the experiment two axial rifts formed as before. Again, they 

propagated as far as the offset trace, remaining straight. However, this time a single, 

discrete fault formed along the offset trace, at right angles to the ridge axis (Figure

discrete fault formed along the offset trace, at right angles to the ridge axis (Figure 

VIII.11A). The fault slipped steadily and there were no appreciable changes in its 

position or orientation. No strike-slip motion occurred elsewhere. Such a kinematical 

configuration is typical of transform faults in nature (Figure VIII.11B) 

VIII.6 Discussion 

VIII.6.1 Straight ridges 

In the experiments, horizontal ridge push resulted in lithosphere gliding and the 

development of axial rifts. It is likely that ridge push caused a component of horizontal 

compression, which was insufficient to generate reverse faults, but sufficient to obstruct 

the formation of extensional structures, other than the axial rifts. Thus the experiments 

yielded realistic structures and kinematics, which were closely comparable to those in 

nature. 

In the experiments, both the magnitude of the ridge push and the velocity of gliding 

were an order of magnitude too large, as compared with the values obtained from 

scaling. The exaggerated values were almost certainly due to the strong contrast in 

density between model lithosphere and asthenosphere. Despite these exaggerations, the 

experiments confirmed that ridge push is capable of (and sufficient for) driving plate 

motion and generating axial rifts. There is no need to invoke other forces, coming for 

example from thermal convection in the asthenosphere. However, this does not mean 

that some such additional forces do not exist in nature.  

 205 



 
Chapter VIII – Physical Models of rifting and transform faulting in a wedge shaped lithosphere   
 
 
In the experiments, the shapes of the axial rifts depended on the thickness of sand.  

Where the axial sand was thin (so that the asthenosphere was shallow), the ridge was an 

area of distributed extensional deformation, where bounding faults were short-lived and 

had small scarps; where the sand was thick, the axial rift was straight and wide, and the 

two bounding faults were long-lived, taking up most of the extension and developing 

prominent scarps. On the Mid-Atlantic ridge, faults have a similar pattern (Shaw and 

Lin, 1993), which has been interpreted as a function of the thermal regime. In cold 

domains at the ends of ridge segments, the lithosphere is thick and strong, and faults are 

long- lived. In contrast, at the segment centres, where the lithosphere is weaker and 

thinner, faults are closely spaced and short-lived, and they have smaller displacements.    

There are several explanations for abyssal hills on ridge flanks (see Edwards et al., 1991 

and references therein). Amongst the possible structures are half-grabens, resulting from 

block tilting.  

In Model D, fault blocks rafted away from the active axial domain and became tilted, 

between faults dipping toward the ridge axis. Thus Model D accounts well for the 

structural fabric of abyssal hills in nature. 

VIII.6.2 Offset ridges 

In Model E, where the thickness of the lithosphere was offset and the ridge push acted 

in opposite senses on each side, why did a transform fault not form at 90º to the ridge 

axis? We suspect that various factors worked against it. First, the amount of isostatic 

uplift was smaller at the offset ends of the ridges, than it was elsewhere along them. 

Therefore the ridge push must have attenuated toward the offset trace. Second, the

 207 



 
Chapter VIII – Physical Models of rifting and transform faulting in a wedge shaped lithosphere   
 
 
model lithosphere was as strong along the offset trace as it was elsewhere. Therefore the 

shear force due to ridge push may have been insufficient to cause failure in strike-slip 

mode, parallel to the offset trace. In contrast, transtensional failure along an oblique 

transform zone, linking the more uplifted segments of the ridges, may have occurred 

more readily. 

In Model F, where a rigid planar fault was embedded within the ridge offset, why did a 

transform fault not form at 90º to the ridge axis? We suspect that the reasons are similar 

to those for Model E. Even though the embedded fault was potentially less resistant to 

slip than the non-ruptured sand, we believe that transtensional failure on an oblique 

transform zone occurred more readily than strike-slip along the embedded fault. That 

the oblique zone formed to one side of the offset trace, instead of crossing it, may have 

been because the glass plate was rigid. The reduction in available space may have 

forced the transform zone to form at a higher angle to the ridge than it did in Model E. 

In Model G, the Mylar sheets slipped readily but they were inextensible. No oblique 

zone could crosscut them; but why did one not form to the side, as in Model E? We 

suspect that isostatic uplift occurred all along the ridges, as far as the embedded fault, 

which may have slipped vertically at that stage. This may have happened all the more 

readily that the embedded fault reached well onto the outer flanks of the ridges. Thus 

the resulting relief may have been more similar to what it is in nature, where it forms 

incrementally. Once the relief was of the required shape, the distribution of ridge push 

may have been sufficient to cause slip on the embedded fault.

Chapter VIII – Physical Models of rifting and transform faulting in a wedge shaped lithosphere   
 
 
In nature, although the brittle upper crust is relatively strong, well-formed faults appear 

to be very weak (Sibson, 1994; Scholz, 1996; Behn et al., 2002). In particular, the 

resistance to slip along transform faults is considered to be extremely small (Zoback, 

1991). However, the reasons for this are not entirely clear. Various possibilities have 

been suggested. 

 The coefficient of internal friction is smaller in the fault gouge than it is in the wall 

rock (Parsons, 2002). 

As a result of fluid overpressure (Byerlee, 1990) or seepage forces (Mourgues and 

Cobbold, 2003), the effective stresses in the fault zone are smaller than they are outside.  

Transform faults form at the onset of cooling and they remain weak, as a result of 

thermal contraction (Collette, 1974; Turcotte, 1974). 

A biaxial stress field promotes extension and fault unlocking in a direction parallel to 

the ridge axis (Zoback, 1991; Gudmundsson, 1995). 

Long-term interaction with other faults (“fault unclamping”) reduces the normal stress 

on a transform fault (Parsons, 2002). 

Presence of serpentinites within the principal transform displacement zone or at ridge 

transform intersections (Escartin et al., 1997, Hirth et al., 1998, Escartin et al., 2001b). 

Our experiments do not provide any clues as to which of these potential mechanisms 

operates in nature. However, the experiments do indicate that transform faults must be 

weaker than the surrounding oceanic lithosphere.

Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 

Chapter IX – Discussion and main conclusions 

The Azores are a region subject to a unique geodynamic setting in the world, it 

comprises: An area of anoumously thick oceanic crust expression of a non-conventional 

Hot Spot, an unstable triple Junction, geometrically and kinematically complex, and a 

plate boundary which displays the slowest spreading rate in the world ridge system.  

During the course of this work, we analysed the spatio-temporal variability of the large 

and small scale processes which interact in the Azores domain, these can be broadly 

systematized as ATJ-AHS for large spatio-temporal scales (Plateau scale) and in 

seismo-tectonic and volcano-tectonic events for smaller spatial working scales (Islands 

and surrounding deeps) at the present day. 

 For the large scales, we discussed possible scenarios of interaction between the ATJ 

and the AHS through time as described independently by different authors for the 

kinematic evolution of the Azores. We focused on interpreting possible tectonic 

scenarios for the generation of the plateau main morpho-tectonic features, and study 

possible positions and tectonic natures of the ATJ along a time span comprising the age 

intervals: 33 Ma to 20 Ma; 20 Ma to 10 Ma and 10 Ma to present. 

For the smaller temporal scales we used multidisciplinary data with different resolution 

to gain insights on the dynamics of the volcano-tectonic systems in the Azores. We 

 211 



 
Chapter IX – Discussion and main conclusions 
 
 
approached the Terceira axis as a spreading system and we studied its behaviour with 

respect to GPS derived kinematics. Two configurations for the Terceira axis 

segmentation were tested by means of elastic half space dislocation modelling. The 

detailed tectonics of Terceira Island and some insights on the morpho-structure of 

neighbouring segments was achieved, using mainly the conjugate analysis of side scan 

sonar images, magnetic charts and when available detailed swath bathymetry data. 

Finally, we considered seismo-tectonic and geodetic data and results from a recent 

series of volcanic and tectonic events to constrain how magmatic accretion couples with 

far-field tectonic regimes interact in the Azores domain.  

Our main conclusions can be summarized as follows: 

IX.1 ATJ Evolution 

The existence of a kinematic independent Azores domain seems to have occurred long 

before the interaction of the Azores plateau with the AHS, and is at least older than C13 

(33.4 Ma). An estimation of the tectonic character acting through the plateau at different 

time intervals varies according to the kinematic model choosen but yield transtension or 

oblique extension as the most favourable tectonic regimes along the time span 

considered. This result is supported by the poor ATJ closure obtained using published 

kinematic poles. Considering NAM/AF finite rotation poles, the EAFZ can be 

approached as the structural homologue of the Pico FZ this conclusion is not 

corroborated by analougous EU/NAM rotations. Therefore if this structure acted as a 

southern plate boundary (South Azores Triple Junction - SATJ) for most of the 

evolution of the Azores plateau. The southern edge of stable Eurasia (here referred as 

the North Azores Triple Junction - NATJ), could be defined along some structures 

 212 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
(ETVR, S. Miguel Island) as precursors of the current continuous Terceira axis as a 

discrete plate boundary. We are not able to provide an age estimate for the Terceira 

Axis nucleation. Given the amount of extension estimated for the time span using EU-

AF stage poles, probably this structure did not act as a stable plate boundary for the time 

span considered, and therefore it has been distributed across the Azores plateau.  

Strong interaction of the SATJ with the AHS started probably at C6 times (20 Ma) 

according to the models referred in this study. After a period of intense melt production 

and topography build-up which reached a maximum at C5, rifting of the Azores plateau 

and onset of normal seafloor spreading begun around 7 to 4 Ma as defined in those 

models.  BetweenC6 and C5 (ca. 15 Ma) the SATJ departed from the EAFZ (from an 

intra-transform context) northwestwards as suggested also by Vogt and Jung (2003).   

The Linear volcanic ridges that define the internal morpho-structure of the plateau are 

sub-parallel to the SATJ migration path and to the current Terceira axis segmentation 

pattern. Three different mechanisms can be evoked to justify their growth: 

1) simultaneous growth by reactivation of fracture zones as leaky transforms. 2) 

diachronical growth due to the AHS migration northward. 3) Diachronical growth due 

to SATJ migration from an intra-transform setting.  A schematic representation of these 

three hypotheses is presented in Figure IX.1.  

Reactivation of MAR fracture zones in the Azores plateau, seems a plausible 

explanation for the LVR in sector 1, given their orientations, but seems to be less 

applicable to the LVR from sector 2 as in this case, FZ traces, would correspond to a ca. 

20º clockwise rotation of sector 2 domain. Evidences of such a block rotation, like 

development of compressional ridges, are not clearly visible across the plateau,

furthermore EU/NAM spreading directions have been fairly uniform since at least 10

 214 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
The second hypothesis implies a northeastern oriented age progression of the LVR as a 

response to the migration in the same direction of the AHS (Vogt and Jung, 2003). 

These authors consider, by comparing the strikes of the LVR in both sectors that the 

LVR are traces of failed rifts either spreading obliquely (Sector 1) or normal (sector 2) 

to the main Nuvel1A conditions. Those authors propose a mechanism to justify both the 

migration of the plate boundary and the arcuate shape of the LVR, where thickening of 

the crust could have caused a zone weakening near the edge of the spreading boundary 

and its relocation northwards. This mechanism remains valid at a broader scale, to 

explain northward migration of the Triple Junction, but the age progression it implies 

for the LVR (progressively younger towards NE), does not fit our main observations 

that geological and magnetic anomaly characteristics LVR sectors are coherent 

internally but clearly distinct between sectors.   

Finally, the third hypothesis, that we favour, links the LVR sector formation with the 

progressive SATJ migration northwestwards.  As discussed in chapter II, considering 

that the ridges in each sector run parallel to the proposed SATJ migration path, we 

envisage that this progressive migration was underlined by areas of distributed 

deformation on the southern edge of the Eurasian plate.  These tectonic features could 

be either reactivated MAR fabrics or, as it was probably the case of sector 2, newly 

formed. These tectonic features would dominantly control magmatism and LVR 

formation at each ATJ progressive migration stage. This model implies that from the 

EAFZ towards the Mid-Atlantic Ridge there is an age progression which seems 

consistent with the fact that the magnetic structure of LVR in sector 2 is more complex, 

and active volcanism less robust than their counterparts in sector 1. The main area of 

earthquake activity is currently located west of sector 1, where there are also evidences 

 215 



 
Chapter IX – Discussion and main conclusions 
 
 
for westward progression of these ridges. Observed active volcanism in sector 2 could 

be residual and feed either by Pico Central volcano and related fissural plumbing system 

in the case of EPVR or by analogue processes through the S. Jorge fissural system or 

the Terceira axis itself in the case of STVR. 

As triple junction migration proceeded, older sections of the LVR are progressively 

abandoned as failed rifts of the distributed plate boundary. Moreover, this becomes 

progressively focalized along the Terceira axis and a new area of distributed 

deformation is created further west.  This is, in our view the current status of LVR 

sector 1 comprising also the MAR off-axis domain between the Condor Ridge and the 

Graciosa parallels.  

Contrary to what is referred by Vogt and Jung, we consider that the morphological 

transitions between LVR sectors have tectonic implications, as they correspond to 

discrete steps between bathymetric terraces and deepning of the Azores plateau. This 

sector limits as already observed, follow the strike of the expected NUVEL1A EU/AF 

spreading directions. Attesting to their probably recent age, they still have a reduced 

expression in the Azores morphology.  

IX.2 ATJ Present day Structure 

Inter-Island GPS observations allowed the study of the kinematic behaviour of each 

Island with respect to both stable Eurasia and African plates. We were able to constrain 

that the bulk of inter-plate deformation is focused along the Terceira axis, with the 

exception of its northern sector corresponding to the Central Islands Group where 

deformation is partitioned between Terceira-Graciosa southwards towards Condor ridge 

south of Faial Island. A broad segmentation pattern for the present day is proposed 

 216 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
based on half space elastic dislocation modelling and geodetical observables. It defines 

a plate boundary centered mainly on the Terceira axis up to the East Graciosa Basin 

longitudes and then on a southern segment defined by the Pico-Faial alignment 

intersection with the MAR.  

This simple segmentation pattern does not fit all geological observations, and we 

consider therefore that the plate boundary between the western sections of the Terceira 

axis and the Faial-Pico volcanic ridge constitutes and area of distributed deformation. 

The GPS based solution, provided in Chapter IV does not accommodate fully the 

mechanics of the Triple Junction, the areal scatter of epicenter locations on the western 

LVR sector 1 nor the recent earthquake activity west of Graciosa Island documented in 

seismic catalogues. As the GPS solution suggests that present ongoing ATJ activity is 

located at the Faial Pico alignment, some tectonic transfer mechanism needs to be 

evoked to accommodate concomitance of this activity within this area, its concentration 

eastwards along the Terceira Ridge and the constrasting lack of significant seismo-

tectonic activity on the deeper sections of the plateau south of this region.   

Analysis of recent tectono-magmatic events and fault relations from sonar and 

bathymetric images, digital elevation models and ortophotomaps from Terceira Island, 

along with magnetic data have allowed us definition of three fault families grouped 

mainly in NNW-SSE,  corresponding to the left lateral ruptures of 1980 in Angra do 

Heroismo and  1998 in Faial; WSW-ENE, also showned in recent studies based on the 

Faial 1998 earthquake (Dias, 2006; Fernandes, 2006) which seem conspicuous regional 

features in LVR sector 1 and finnaly WNW-ESE corresponding to the strike of the LVR 

in this sector.   

 217 



 
Chapter IX – Discussion and main conclusions 
 
 
The azimuth for the relative motion between Eurasia and Africa is in sector 1, N66º for 

the NUVEL 1A (De Mets et al, 1994) model. The azimuth for the relative motion 

between Eurasia to Nubia is N72º and N80º for the models DEOS2K (Fernandes et al., 

2003) and REVEL (Sella et al., 2002), respectively. These are based solely on GPS 

observations and should be used as a reference for present-day motions.  

The displacement vectors obtained by the elastic modelling of a set of rectangular 

sources, performed in chapter VII, has shown a natural agreement with the expected 

opening normal to the Faial fissural system. However this opening direction is oblique 

when compared to Eu-Af(Nub) expectable direction (between ca. 35º and 50º) and, 

furthermore the expectable right lateral component across this plate boundary is 

missing. A similar result was obtained by (Lourenço et al., 1998) which showed that 

traction vector averages calculated from focal mechanisms parallel to the Faial graben 

directions, have an obliquity between ca 48 and 58º, when compared with kinematic 

models describing the behaviour of this plate boundary. Other LVR in this sector like S. 

Jorge, or the Serreta ridge seem to present a similar discrepancy given their WNW-ESE 

strikes. 

A possible interpretation for these apparently contradictory observations is to assume a 

partitioning in space and time of Nuvel 1A spreading vectors and in two main 

components (see Figure XI.2): one of pure traction (rifting stage) and one dominated by 

shear (tectonic rotation stage).  

Rifting events are magmatic dominated and related with dyke emplacement along LVR 

axis and characterized, as constrained by the Capelinhos eruption model by extension 

normal to the LVR axis.  These spreading events trigger nearly pure dip-slip faulting in 

 218 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
crustal sections along dyke strike, laterally adjacent and roofing the dyke emplacement 

and possible fissural type eruptions on the surface. Generalizing the Capelinhos eruption 

geodetical observations, we can therefore consider the dyke emplacement process and 

the corresponding growth of the LVR as a type I magma filled crack propagation. For 

example, the graben in the western tip of S. Jorge Island can represent the crack tip 

process zone and tip depression, typical of this structures. In this regard, growth of the 

Islands would be intrinsically more dependent of internal magma pressure distributions 

and of magma migration paths across pre-existing zones of weakness during dyke 

emplacement process than of the external regional stress field.  

Shear stages would be characterized by left lateral strike slip faulting along N150º fault 

planes like those which characterize the major Faial and Angra do Heroismo 

earthquakes, and also along the WSW-ENE faulting directions, in this case acting as  

probable relay zones with mixed right lateral strike slip and dip-slip displacements. 

Furthermore, if they are disrupted by slip along N150 faults, than opening as tension 

cracks or as normal faults is favoured. This might translate the mechanism and 

distribution of the aftershocks of the Faial 1998 earthquake. 

This two modes of tectono-magmatic strain accommodation would characterize the 

distributed deformation nature of the interplate zone (roughly LVR sector 1) adjoining 

the Terceira axis and Faial-Pico axis (Figure IX.3). The stress field prevailing in this 

area would than be right lateral transtensional, with maximum compressive stress 

horizontal and sub-parallel to the LVR. This regime, and the non-coaxialiality of 

deformation, can induce strain partitioning as observed at times in Terceira Island field 

studies.

kinematic behavior across the studied sectors and as a function of dominant ruling processes 
Magmatic (left) or Tectonic (right).  Active structures are presented by continuous lines.  In sector 
1 the tectonic regime is transtensional, whereas in sector 2 is probably that of oblique spreading. 

 

It is not clear if this tectonic spreading regime is active in the LVR sector 2. The fault 

pattern configuration present in the EPVR southeastern tip, is conformal with the 

kinematic constraints provided by sector 1 focal mechanisms. However, lack of seismic 

activity is this domain implies that either these faults are dominantly aseismic or they 

 220 



 
Tectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction 

 
 
are becoming inactive and that LVR are being progressively abandoned as failed rifts. 

Consequently, in this sector, extension seems to be focalizing within the Terceira axis 

itself. The faulting pattern in the SETVR, despite having strike which is sub-parallel to 

left lateral rupture of Angra do Heroismo earthquake, is more consistent with oblique 

right lateral extensional regime. This imposes that the stress regime changes accordingly 

and is characterized by a maximum compressive stress sub-vertical and minimum 

compressive stress sub-horizontal and sub-parallel to the spreading directions predicted 

by Nuvel-1A or GPS based kinematic models (e.g. Revel and Deos2k), therefore 

characterized by coaxial deformation.  

This focalized plate boundary domain fits between two other faulting domains defined 

by Ribeiro (2002) along the Terceira axis. This author suggests a relation exists between 

the lithosphere state of stress off axis with the response of faulting in each domain on 

axis (cf. Figure 4.9, pg 193 from Ribeiro et al., 2002). East of the area here studied in 

more detail, in S. Miguel Island and its vicinities, right lateral strike slip faults are 

reported by this author, striking N150º, probably related with the intersection of this 

segment with the Gloria Fault. 

 The transition from distributed transtension to focalized oblique extension is defined by 

a set of morphological setps between LVR 1 and LVR2 sectors here interpreted as 

tectonic faults which are acting as tranfer zones between both domains and which 

strikes are parallel to Nuvel1A spreading directions (i.e WSW-ENE).

IX.3 Future Research 

A great deal of work needs to be performed to refine and improve the knowledge we 

have been gaining in the Azores domain in the past few years. The main problem in 

Azores interpretations is the almost absolute lack of knowledge on boundary conditions, 

notably, its thermal structure in depth, and the still limited data we have on the Azores 

plateau bathymetry itself. In my point of view future efforts in Azores research, 

considering each scientific domain should be : 

Geodesy: 

Continuing the inter-Island and intra-Island GPS observation efforts, which have been 

performed in the framework of TANGO and STAMINA projects, and increment intra-

Island networks, would consolidate GPS interpretation by lengthening the time series in 

this geodynamic context and provide an additional tool to constrain how the far-field 

displacement vectors are partitioning within each Island complex volcano-tectonic 

architecture therefore constraining its crustal deformation. 

Geophysics: 

Our ability to perform a detailed analysis of the processes which act and shape the 

Azores is undermined by inexistence of a proper bathymetric basemap.  A continued 

effort to collect swath bathymetry in this domain is crucial to allow clearer answers and 

as a ground to evaluate the third and fourth dimensions (i.e. depth and time).  

Heat flow measurements within some of the Terceira axis basins would help clarify in 

what extent is the Azores truly a rift system or otherwise a fully developed spreading 

center. Determining the structure of the basins with reflection/refraction studies would 

 223 



 
Chapter IX – Discussion and main conclusions 
 
 
also provide more constraints for the gravimetric modelling as well as provide tectonic 

constraints on its role in Terceira axis dynamics. Refinement of the seismic catalogue, 

namely in what deals with azimuthal coverage, and better definition of hypocentral 

distribution would also favour analysis and tectonic interpretations. 

Geology: 

Direct seafloor observations by submersible or ROV as well as sampling of the basins 

walls would help define a clear crustal structure for this particular case of hyper-slow 

plate boundary.  

Following Vogt and Jung, 2003, one of the basins within the Terceira axis, should be a 

target for an ODP drilling site, as an enormous amount of information could be 

retrieved from such an initiative. It would allow determination of the age of the basins 

and hence of the Terceira axis, their detailed structure, and the way hyper-slow crustal 

construction is achieved. 

Isotopic Dating of seafloor monogenic volcanism and samples of the base of the LVR 

would help to constrain the Azores temporal evolution.  

Analogue and Numerical Modelling: 

Some insights on LVR development and the physical properties of Azores lithosphere 

and thermal structure could be gained by numerical modelling of the LVR growth, 

namely the suggestion that these structures are propagating westwards either as newly 

formed cracks or by reactivation of pre-existing fracture zones.
