Summary  

 

Different problems are daily discuss on environmental aspects such acid rain, eutrophication, 

global warming and an others problems. Rarely do we find some discussions about phosphorus 

problematic. Through the years the phosphorus as been a real problem and must be more 

discussed. 

On this thesis was done a global material flow analysis of phosphorus, based on data from the 

year 2004, the production of phosphate rock in that year was 18.9 million tones, almost this 

amount it was used as fertilizer on the soil and the plants only can uptake, on average, 20% of 

the input of fertilizer to grow up, the remainder is lost for the phosphorus soil. In the 

phosphorus soil there is equilibrium between the phosphorus available to uptake from the 

plants and the phosphorus associate with other compounds, this equilibrium depends of the 

kind of soil and is related with the soil pH.  

A reserve inventory was done and we have 15,000 million tones as reserve, the amount that is 

economical available. The reserve base is estimated in 47,000 million tones. The major 

reserves can be found in Morocco and Western Sahara, United Sates, China and South Africa. 

The reserve estimated in 2009 was 15,000 million tone of phosphate rock or 1,963 million tone 

of P. If every year the mined phosphate rock is around 22 Mt/yr (phosphorus production on 

2008 USGS 2009), and each year the consumption of phosphorus increases because of the 

food demand, the reserves of phosphate rock will be finished in about 90 years, or maybe even 

less. 

About the value/impact assessment was done a qualitative analysis, if on the future we don’t 

have more phosphate rock to produce fertilizers, it is expected a drop on the crops yields, each 

depends of the kind of the soil and the impact on the humans feed and animal production will 

not be a relevant problem. 

We can recovery phosphorus from different waste streams such as ploughing crop residues 

back into the soil, Food processing plants and food retailers, Human and animal excreta, Meat 

and bone meal, Manure fibre, Sewage sludge and wastewater.  Some of these examples are 

developed in the paper. 

   



Resumo 

 

Nestes últimos anos as questões ambientais são cada vez mais estudadas, diariamente fala-se 

em problemas tais como o aquecimento global, emissão de gases poluentes, poluição de 

águas. Por outro lado, a depleção de recursos naturais tem menos impacto na comunicação 

social. 

A quantidade de fósforo existente no nosso planeta versos a sua utilização constitui hoje em 

dia um grande problema ambiental. As reservas de fósforo existentes são finitas tais como a 

do petróleo, e a extracção do fósforo tem sido crescente de acordo com as necessidades 

mundiais.  

O fósforo é um componente essencial para o crescimento das plantas e grande parte do 

fósforo produzido é utilizado na agricultura como fertilizante. No entanto o ciclo natural do 

fósforo é muito lento podendo levar um milhão de anos para formar e existir fósforo sob a 

forma disponível para extracção.  

Por esta razão, na presente tese a Análise de Fluxo Material (MFA) feita só é considerado no 

ciclo do fósforo a quantidade anual extraída, a produção dos diversos produtos contendo 

fósforo, e os principais fluxos de uso do fósforo.  

O grande objectivo da elaboração do MFA foi ter uma noção da ordem de grandeza de fósforo 

perdido no ambiente, para posteriormente estudar os impactos ao nível do crescimento das 

plantas bem como nos humanos e animais. O MFA realizado permite concluir que no ano de 

2009 a reserva de fósforo em rocha com potencial para ser extraída foi estimada em 15.000 

Mt de fósforo, e a produção deste elemento foi de 1.963 Mt, o que significa que as reservas de 

fósforo terminarão em 90 anos, ou talvez menos. 

Nesta tese foram avaliadas hipóteses para os possíveis impactos no caso de não haver fósforo 

para fertilizar os solos, caso as reservas de fósforo terminem dentro deste século, como 

previsto por dados estatísticos das reservas existentes e da sua produção anual.  

Foi avaliado o impacto causado no crescimento das plantas, se houver um défice de fósforo na 

terra onde a planta está a desenvolver-se, os dados de diferentes testes comprovam que 

influenciará o crescimento das plantas, principalmente o crescimento das raízes. No entanto 

numa entrevista com um especialista nesta área, este é da opinião que a planta irá adaptar-se 



desenvolvendo as raízes de modo a procurar fósforo noutros níveis da terra, portanto não terá 

grande impacto. 

Estudou-se também o impacto na produção de agrícola e em discussão com diferentes 

especialistas agrónomos, de um modo genérico, ao longo do tempo a produção irá decair, pois 

existe ainda uma quantidade de fósforo disponível no solo (disponibilidade depende 

predominantemente do pH), quando terminar o fósforo disponível no solo a disponibilidade 

irá depender da capacidade de adaptação da planta em desenvolver raízes de modo a procurar 

fósforo noutras camadas da terra. 

Inicialmente na equipa de estudo onde estava inserida, supôs-se que se há menos fósforo 

disponível para a planta nos solos, logo a planta também teria menos fósforo. As plantas 

contendo menos fósforo iriam causar um impacto na alimentação dos humanos e animais. 

Mas, diferentes agrónomos são da opinião que a quantidade de fósforo irá manter-se igual nas 

e mesmo que houvesse um decréscimo os humanos consomem mais fósforo do que realmente 

necessitam diariamente.  

Portanto é necessário procurar soluções pois o maior impacto será na produção agrícola, o que 

provavelmente irá gerar também conflitos socioeconómicos.  

Com vista a minimizar os consumos de fósforo, recuperar fósforo em fluxos que são perdidos 

para a natureza, já existem em diferentes partes no mundo métodos de 

reciclagem/recuperação. A Suécia é um bom exemplo, pois tem sanitas próprias para separar a 

urina das fezes, de modo a recuperar a urina e utilizá-la directamente como fertilizante, visto a 

urina conter uma elevada percentagem em fósforo. Outro caso de sucesso, é uma empresa 

que desenvolveu um fungo que é capaz de transformar o fósforo que esteja não disponível 

para a planta no solo numa forma disponível para absorção da planta. 

É obvio que a depleção dos recursos do fósforo é um problema a nível ambiental, mas ainda há 

vários estudos que podem vir a ser feitos e também é essencial a divulgação desta 

problemática à sociedade, para uma tomada de consciência colectiva.

2. Introduction to Phosphorus Problematic 

2.1. Phosphate rock and its characteristics 
 

Phosphorus is the eleventh most abundant element in the lithosphere. Owing to its relative 

reactivity, it is generally associated with calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), fluorine (F), chloride (Cl), 

metals such as iron (Fe), aluminium (Al), magnesium (Mg), heavy metals, for example cadmium 

(Cd), radionucleids like uranium (U) etc. In reality almost every element that can be found in 

the periodic table is represented in phosphate rock. 

There are two main types of phosphate rock deposits, igneous and sedimentary, which have 

widely differing mineralogical, textural and chemical characteristics. 

The most prevalent phosphate minerals in these rocks are species of apatite, i.e. calcium 

phosphate with quartz, calcite, dolomite, clay and iron oxide as gangue components. Igneous 

rock is often associated with carbonatites and/or alkalic intrusions and is generally low in 

grade i.e. low concentration of phosphate. The abundance ratio of igneous versus sedimentary 

rock is 13 to 87. Some 80% of the world phosphate production is derived from sedimentary 

phosphate deposits. 

More than 75% of the globally commercially exploited phosphate rock is surface mined, which 

can take many forms from manual methods to the employment of highly mechanized 

technologies, with the remainder recovered by underground mining. 

Phosphate content in currently mined rocks can range from over 40% to below 5%. The mined 

rock is further processed to remove the bulk of the contained impurities and thus upgrade the 

rock. Consequently, the rock concentrate contains an increased apatite content of an 

improved quality. The beneficiation process usually allows a concentration of around 1.5x but 

higher ratios up to 9x are possible with some rocks. After beneficiation, phosphate rock 

(concentrate) generally ranges from 26% to about 34% P2O5 and up to as much as 42%. 

Phosphate rock can be beneficiated by many methods, and usually a combination of methods 

is used. In general, with the lower concentration of phosphate and lower quality deposit, the 

more waste is generated. Furthermore, more energy and chemicals are required per ton of 

useful phosphate produced. Consequently, the cost for recovery and beneficiation of 

phosphate rock increases significantly in relation to lower grade and lower quality deposit. An 

analysis of production costs must thus be an integral part in the assessment of the lifetime of 

phosphate deposits and the likely cost of fertilizers in the future. 

Most phosphate rock is further processed, but very small volumes are applied directly to acidic 

soils as fertilizer (NHM, 1998).

2.2. Importance of Phosphorous  
 

While access to water and energy sources are now understood to be limiting factors to 

achieving global food security, the implications of future phosphate scarcity has not received 

explicit mention in key dialogues on global food security. Fig. 1 depicts four of the key current 

discourses on global food security, illustrating that phosphorus is missing from the picture and 

could be added (Cordell, 2008).  

 
 

 

Figure 1 - Dominant discourses on global food security: including accessibility to food, health, 

energy and water (Cordell, 2008). 

 

Phosphorus in the context of food production and the environment is most commonly framed 

as an environmental pollutant, which together with nitrogen, contributes to eutrophication 

and algal blooms worldwide. However, phosphorus is simultaneously a critical nutrient input in 

agriculture whose global reserves are being rapidly depleted. Rarely are phosphorus pollution 

and phosphate scarcity discussed in the same context. 

The risks of not considering systemic links are exemplified by the recent increased global 

concern about oil scarcity and climate change leading to a rapid production boom of biofuel 

crops which not only compete with food production for prime fertile land, yet require profuse 



 5 
  

amounts of phosphorus fertilizers. This sudden increased demand for fertilizers worldwide has 

contributed to the seven-fold increase in the price of phosphate rock. In this sense, the peak 

oil problem is being shifted to a peak phosphorus problem, making the ‘supra’-system 

unsustainable in the long-term (Cordell, 2008) 

 

2.3. The utilization of phosphorus 
 

Crop production relied on natural levels of soil phosphorus and the addition of locally available 

organic matter like manure and human excreta (Maarald, 1998). To keep up with increased 

food demand due to rapid population growth in the 20
th

 century, guano and later rock 

phosphate were applied extensively to food crops (Brink, 1977; Smil, 2000b). Fig. 2 gives a 

broad outline of the evolution of phosphorus fertilizer use for food production.  

A long time ago, the Chinese civilization used human excreta as fertilizer, like the Japanese 

civilization did (Matsui, 1997). 

In Europe, soil degradation and recurring famines during the 17th and 18th centuries created 

the need to supplement animal and human excreta with other sources of phosphorus 

(Maarald, 1998). In the early 19th century, for instance, England imported large quantities of 

bones from other European countries. In addition to the application of phosphorus from new 

sources, improved agricultural techniques enabled European agriculture to recover from the 

famines of the 18th century (Maarald, 1998). These improvements included crop rotation, 

improved handling of manure, and in particular, and the introduction of new crops such as 

clover which could fix nitrogen from the atmosphere.  

 
Figure 2 - Historical sources of phosphorus fertilizers since 1800 until 2000, based in 

calculation from Brink (1997), Buckingham and Jasinski (2004), IFA (2006) and Smil (2000b), 

(Cordell et al. 2009).

In 1840 Liebig formulated the ‘mineral theory’, which replaced the ‘humus theory’ that plants 

and animals were given life in a mysterious way from dead or decomposing plants and animals 

(Liebig, 1840; Maarald, 1998). Liebig provided a scientific explanation: nutrients such as 

nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium were elements circulating between dead and living 

material (Maarald, 1998). This discovery occurred during a period of rapid urbanization in 

Europe, when fertilizer factories were being established around growing cities. Food 

production was local and the factories manufactured phosphorus fertilizers from locally 

available organic waste products, such as human excreta, industrial organic waste by-products, 

animal dung, fish, ash, bones, and other slaughterhouse by-products (Maarald, 1998; Neset et 

al., 2008). However, around the mid-to-late 19th century, the use of local organic matter was 

replaced by phosphorus material from distant sources. The mining of guano (bird droppings 

deposited over previous millennia) and phosphate-rich rock had begun (Brink, 1977; Smil, 

2000b). World trade in guano grew rapidly, but it relied on a limited resource which declined 

by the end of the 19th century (Stewart et al., 2005). Phosphate rock was seen as an unlimited 

source of concentrated phosphorus and the market for mineral fertilizers developed rapidly. At 

the same time, the introduction of flush toilets in towns meant that human waste was 

discharged into water bodies instead of being returned to the soil. There were protests among 

intellectuals that farmers were being robbed of human manure. 

 

Trade in food grew steadily with urbanization and colonization, but insufficient amounts of 

nutrients were returned to the areas of food production to balance off-takes. By the late 19th 

century, processed mineral phosphorus fertilizer was routinely used in Europe and its use grew 

substantially in the 20th. Processed mineral fertilizers such as ordinary superphosphate (OSP) 

typically contained an order of magnitude greater concentration of phosphorus than did 

manure (Smil, 2000b). Application of such highly concentrated fertilizers helped rectify the 

phosphorus deficiency of soils. In the mid-20th century the Green Revolution improved 

agricultural output in many countries. As well as introducing new crop varieties, the Green 

Revolution involved the application of chemical fertilizers. This new approach saved millions 

from starvation and the proportion of the world’s population that was undernourished 

declined despite rapid population growth (IFPRI, 2002; Cordell et al., 2009). 

 

Nowadays, the use of fertilizers for phosphorus, nitrogen and potassium is indispensable to 

the increase in food demand.

2.4. Phosphate rock reserves  
 

Before the phosphate rock reserve finishes, a global peak in phosphates reserves can be 

predicted, and it is estimated to occur on the next 30 years. 

Hubbert in 1949 predicted (Hubbert, 1949) that the production of oil resources will eventually 

reach a maximum rate or ‘peak’ based on the finite nature of non-renewable resources, after 

which production will decline. Hubbert and later others contest that the important period is 

not when 100% of the resource is depleted, but rather when it reaches a maximum 

production, which occurs when 50% of the resource is still in the ground. After this point, 

production will decreases, placing upward pressure on prices and increasing international 

tensions (Campbell, 1997).  

This analysis of peak phosphorus is based on estimated P in current world phosphate rock 

reserves (approximately 2358 Mt P ) based on US Geological Survey data and cumulative 

production between 1900-2007 (totaling 854 Mt P) based on US Geological Survey data 

(Buckingham and Jasinski, 2006; Jasinski, 2007, 2008) and European Fertilizer Manufacturers 

Association (2000). The area under the Hubbert curve must equal the depleted plus current 

reserves, totaling approximately 3,212 Mt P. Units of phosphorus are presented as elemental 

P, rather than P2O5 (containing 44% P) or phosphate rock (containing 29-34% P2O5) as 

commonly used by industry (Stuart et al., 2006).  

The data for production is fitted using a Gaussian distribution (Laherrere, 2000), based on the 

depleted plus current reserves estimate of 3,212 Mt P, and a least squares optimization which 

results in a production at peak of 28 Mt P/a and a peak year of 2034 (Fig. 3) (Stuart et al., 

2006).

Figure 3 - Peak phosphorus ‘Hubbert’ curve, indicating that production will eventually reach a 

maximum, after which it will decline (Stuart et al., 2006). 

While it is understood that phosphate rock, like oil and other key non-renewable resources will 

follow a Hubbert production curve, a key difference between peak oil and peak phosphorus, is 

that oil can be replaced with other forms of energy once it becomes too scarce. However there 

is no substitute for P in food production (Cordell, et al, 2009). P cannot be produced or 

synthesized in a laboratory. Quite simply, without phosphorus, we cannot produce food 

(Stuart et al., 2006).  

Although oil is unavailable once it is used, while phosphorus is an element that can be 

captured after use and recirculated for use within economic and technical limits. Peak 

phosphorus is also linked to peak oil. For example, the recent oil price shock and growing 

concern about climate change has stimulated a dramatic increase in biofuel crop production 

globally, which in turn increases the demand for phosphate fertilizers, and hence the proximity 

of the phosphorus peak (Stuart et al., 2006; Cordell et al., 2009).

3. Global Material Flow Analysis (MFA) of Phosphorus 

3.1. What a is MFA  
 

Material flow analysis is a method to describe, investigate, and evaluate the metabolism of 

anthropogenic and geogenic systems. MFA defines terms and procedures to establish material 

balances of systems (Brunner, 2003). It is an accounting system that captures the mass 

balances in an economy, where inputs (extractions + imports) equal outputs (consumptions + 

exports + accumulation + wastes), and thus is based on the laws of Thermodynamics.  

 Material Flow Analysis recognizes that material through put is required for all economic 

activities and hypotheses whether the flow of materials is sustainable in terms of the 

environmental burden it creates. It accounts for all materials and energy used in production 

and consumption, including the hidden flows, or ecological rucksack, of materials that were 

extracted in the production cycle but which never entered the final products.  The physical size 

of these hidden flows is often many times larger than the flows that end up in actual products.  

The identification of wastes is a major issue in MFA, as the purpose of conducting a MFA is to 

minimize the flow of materials while maximizing the human welfare generated by the flow. Its 

methodology allows the monitoring of wastes that are typically unaccounted for in traditional 

economic analyses. As such, it is a method for evaluating the efficiency of using material 

resources. 

 MFA was develop in Europe, largely at the Wuppertal Institute in Germany, and has been 

adopted as a methodology by the European Union with respect to its sustainable development 

program.  To date the focus of MFA has been primarily regional or national; a variety of MFA 

studies have been conducted for both developed countries and economies in transition, 

including Germany, the UK,  Japan, Brazil, Venezuela, Chile and China. EU wide studies have 

also been conducted, and a global MFA is now underway (The Sustainable scale Project 2003).  

   

3.2. MFA and Relation to Sustainable Scale 
 

MFA is a method for operationalizing the concept of material throughput, and as such is an 

important contribution to measuring one component of sustainable scale. MFA has proven 

very useful for demonstrating the negative impacts associated with various specific economic 

activities. It has highlighted in a very practical way the unsustainability of specific throughputs 

(e.g. high reliance on non-renewable resources), the incompatibility of absolute levels of input 

with an equal Earthshare identified within the Ecological Footprint , the displacement of 

ecological burden to trading partners (generally from developed to undeveloped nations), and 

the enormous wastes involved in specific products or services.  

Continued development of this important tool will likely increase its usefulness in linking 

economic throughput with ecological limits, especially as it is applied to the global level 

(Brunner, 2003).

3.3. MFA Procedures 
 

MFA consists of several steps, in general begins with the definition of the problem and the 

adequate goals. Then relevant substances and appropriate system boundaries, processes, and 

goals are selected. Next, mass flows of goods and substance concentrations in these flows are 

assessed. The final step is to present the results in an appropriate way, in this case as a flow 

chart (Brunner, 2003).  

3.3.1. Selection of Substance 
 

There are various approaches to choosing substances relevant for an MFA. By one hand, they 

depend on the purpose of the MFA, and on the other hand, they depend on the kind of system 

on which the MFA is based (Brunner, 2003).  

In this case study the substance is phosphorous. The phosphorus can be found on the nature in 

different forms, as we can see on the phosphorous cycle (Fig. 4). 

 

Figure 4 – Nature Phosphorous cycle (vincejtremante.tripod.com).  



 11 
  

In the nature phosphorus is found in different forms. In the atmosphere P is present on 

particulates over land and over oceans; in land P is found on biota, soil, mineable rock, fresh-

water (dissolved); finally in the ocean P is present on biota, dissolved (inorganic), detritus 

(particulates) and sediments. 

 

3.3.1.1. Soil Chemistry  
 

When the phosphate in fertilizers and manure is used on the soil, the phosphate is initially 

quite soluble and available. Manure contains soluble phosphate, organic phosphate, and 

inorganic phosphate compounds that are quite available. When the fertilizer or manure 

phosphate comes in contact with the soil, various reactions begin occurring that make the 

phosphate less soluble and less available (Fig. 5). The rates and products of these reactions are 

dependent on such soil conditions as pH, moisture content, temperature, and the minerals 

already present in the soil. 

 

 

Figure 5 – Scheme showing the interactions on the Phosphorus in soil. 

As a particle of fertilizer comes in contact with the soil, moisture from the soil will begin 

dissolving the particle. Dissolving of the fertilizer increases the soluble phosphate in the soil 

solution around the particle and allows the dissolved phosphate to move a short distance away 

from the fertilizer particle. Movement is slow but may be increased by rainfall or irrigation 

water flowing through the soil. As phosphate ions in solution slowly migrate away from the 

fertilizer particle, most of the phosphate will react with the minerals within the soil. Phosphate 

ions generally react by adsorbing to soil particles or by combining with elements in the soil 

such as calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), aluminum (Al), and iron (Fe), and forming compounds 

that are solids. The adsorbed phosphate and the newly formed solids are relatively available to 

meet crop needs.

Gradually reactions occur in which the adsorbed phosphate and the easily dissolved 

compounds of phosphate form more insoluble compounds that cause the phosphate to be 

become fixed and unavailable. Over time this results in a decrease in soil test P. The 

mechanisms for the changes in phosphate are complex and involve a variety of compounds. In 

alkaline soils Ca is the dominant cation (positive ion) that will react with phosphate. A general 

sequence of reactions in alkaline soils is the formation of dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate, 

octocalcium phosphate, and hydroxyapatite. The formation of each product results in a 

decrease in solubility and availability of phosphate. In acidic soils (especially with soil pH less 

than 5.5) Al is the dominant ion that will react with phosphate. In these soils the first products 

formed would be amorphous Al and Fe phosphates, as well as some Ca phosphates. The 

amorphous Al and Fe phosphates gradually change into compounds that resemble crystalline 

variscite (an Al phosphate) and strengite (an Fe phosphate). Each of these reactions will result 

in very insoluble compounds of phosphate that are generally not available to plants. Reactions 

that reduce P availability occur in all ranges of soil pH but can be very pronounced in alkaline 

soils (pH &gt; 7.3) and in acidic soils (pH &amp;lt;5.5). Maintaining soil pH between 6 and 7 will generally 

result in the most efficient use of phosphate, as it is shown on Fig. 6 (Busman, 2008).  

 

Figure 6 – Correlation between the phosphorus available with soil pH (Busman, 2008). 

 

 

3.3.2. System definition in space and time 
 

The spatial system boundary is usually determined by the scope of the Project, so the 

boundary here is global including all streams with phosphorous in world. 

 

 Temporal system boundaries are comparatively easier to determine. This is especially the case 

when average flows and stocks over a longer period of time are of interest. In this case, the 

time span of investigation, which is identical with the temporal system boundary, has to be 

extended long enough to outweigh the momentary unsteadiness of the system. Usually in this 

case of analysis the temporal system boundary is one year (Brunner 2003). 

 

 



 13 
  

 

3.3.3. Identification of Relevant Flows and Process  
 

After selecting the substance and defining system boundary, a first rough balance of goods is 
carried out for the system. (Brunner 2003)

Other important Processes containing phosphorus:

? Private Household and Household, e.g. human feed, detergents, chemical compounds.  
? Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP), such as excreta and organic wastes, sludge 

and sewage;  

? Animals, such as animal fodder, animal consumption, feed-grade additives and animal 
manure. 

In the flow chart (Fig.7) an overview of all important streams is shown. The flow chart 

highlights more the human influence instead of influence from the nature. 

4. Practical Part 
 

A MFA was done in flow chart presentation taking data from recently MFA from Liu et al. and 

(2008), Cordell et al. (2009). The year of all data for MFA is 2004. 

In order to understand better the relations between the P on the soil and the P available on 

the soils, and also to understand the consequences/impact on the crops, humans feed and 

animal production, a questionnaire was prepared to present to two agricultural specialists, 

Gitte Rubæk from University of Aarhus and Jan Schjorring from The University of Copenhagen.

5. Results and Discussion 
The phosphate rock is a nature reserve, so it is considered as a pool, as the P pool on the soil, 

this flow chart as the propose to show the relation in use the phosphorus reserve and the 

consequences on the nature focus on the consequences on the soil. The nature is not so 

relevant and this study because the natural phosphorus flow occurs very slowly, one single 

loop of the nature cycle can take over 1 million years (Liu et al., 2008). 

 

5.1. MFA Flow chart 
 

The flow chart (Fig. 7) begins with the transformation of phosphate rock in phosphate ore by 

mining. Phosphate ore is extracted with an average P content of 13% by surface or strip mining 

and contains calcium, iron, aluminum, magnesium, silica, sodium, potassium, fluorine, and 

many others impurities (Lauriente, 2003).

5.2. Phosphorus flows in production of phosphoric acid 
 

The production of phosphate rock in 2004 was 143 Mt (USGS, 2009), so we have an input of 

18.9 Mt of P in the system. Most of the phosphorus produced is used on the world soils as a 

fertilizer, on the MFA flow chart we can see that 17.66 go to the soil. Recently, Cordell 

estimated that 8 Mt of P per year is lost by erosion on the soils.  

The most common way to produce phosphoric acid is the wet phosphoric acid production and 

the thermal phosphoric production. Phosphoric acid is the precursor of many of intermediate 

and end uses of phosphate compounds. 

5.2.1. Wet Phosphoric Acid 
Wet phosphoric acid is usually produced in large complexes often near the phosphate rock 

deposits. A large part of the acid is used near the sites of rock production to produce 

nongranular and granular triple superphosphates and granular ammonium phosphates. 

However, substantial amounts of wet phosphoric acid are shipped to local and distant plants. 

The phosphate ore is digested as slurry with sulfuric acid in multiple reactions tanks or in a 

compartmented single tank. Slurry from the reaction system is filtered to remove the calcium 

sulfate that precipitates in the reaction. Conditions during the reactions are controlled to 

obtain crystals of calcium sulfate that filter at a high rate. The dehydrate wet phosphoric acid 

process results in the precipitation of byproduct calcium sulfate as the dehydrate form. Other 

wet phosphoric acid processes are operating at higher temperatures resulting in the 

precipitation of calcium sulfate in the hemihydrates or the anhydrite form. The filter cake is 

washed to recover about 95% of phosphoric acid at a concentration usually ranging from 28% 

to 30% P2O5 for the dehydrate process or 40%-50% for the hemihydrates process. 

The filter-grade acid is concentrated by vacuum evaporation to 52%-54% P2O5 (merchant 

grade) for shipping and for use in production phosphate fertilizers. For ammonium phosphate 

production at the site, a concentration of about 40% -45% is sufficient. Wet phosphoric acid, 

used mainly in preparation of liquid fertilizers, is prepared by concentration to 68%-70% P2O5 

content (Kauwenbergh, 2007).  

 

The world consumption of wet phosphoric acid was 14.3 Mt of P for 2004. It is a precursor for 

fertilizers and for industrial phosphates (Villalha et al., 2008). 

 

 

 

 



 18 
  

Wet acid is used to produce the following fertilizers: 

• Ammonium phosphates (a world figure of 6.870 Mt of P for 2004; IFA 2006) - normally 

referred to as APP, it is the most widely consumed fertilizer; 

• Nitric phosphates and other nitrogen containing phosphate fertilizers (4.160 Mt of P IFA 

2006); 

• Single phosphates (a world figure of 2.749 Mt of P for 2004; IFA 2006); 

• Triple phosphates (a world figure of 933 thousand metric tons of P for 2004; IFA 2006;Villalha 

et al., 2008). 

5.2.2. Thermal Phosphoric Acid Production 
 

The thermal process first requires the production of elemental phosphorus. In this production, 

carbon monoxide and phosphorus are produced as gases, together with SiF4. The phosphorus 

(product) is condensed, the carbon monoxide is used as fuel or burned as waste, and the SiF4 is 

either lost through emissions (older plants) or collected (newer plants). In the production of 

thermal acid from elemental phosphorus, the major emission is phosphoric acid mist. The mist 

is mostly recovered, depending on the plant, but some is lost to the air (Villalha et al., 2008).  

Thermal acid is of a higher grade than wet acid and is thus used in the food industry and in 

industrial phosphates, whereas wet acid mostly goes to fertilizer production. Wet acid can be 

further purified by extraction and used in combination with thermal acid (Villalha et al., 2008).  

 

Wet acid is also purified through extraction (0.44 Mt P/year estimated for 2004) and used in 

the production of industrial phosphates (technical and food applications), this amount is used 

in the production of thermal phosphoric acid.  

Wet phosphoric acid has a few end uses of its own (0.13 Mt P/year estimated for 2004)—

namely, in phosphoric acid fuel cells, as a chemical wet etchant, for metal surface treatment as 

a pickling agent (to remove oxides on steel), for chemical polishing of aluminum, as a dilute 

solution in food additives, for catalytic applications, and for waste water treatment (Villalha et 

al., 2008).  

 

Red and white phosphorus are intermediates used in the production of phosphides, such as 

aluminum phosphides, and in the production of Phosphine (Villalha et al., 2008). 

 

The production of elemental phosphorus is necessary for the production of thermal 

phosphoric acid, red phosphorus, and a group of organic and inorganic phosphorus 

compounds that are categorized under the heading various phosphorus compounds. 

Elemental phosphorus production totals 750,000 metric tons of P, as an annual estimate, of 

which 83% goes to thermal phosphoric acid production. The remainder (0.12 Mt P/year 

estimated for 2004) goes to various phosphorus compounds (Villalha et al., 2008). 

 

 Apart from thermal and wet acid production, phosphate rock is also used in the production of 

normal superphosphates and nitric phosphates (both fertilizers). These forms are produced by 



 19 
  

acidulation of phosphate rock with sulfuric acid, by acidulation with acid nitric, respectively. 

For 2004, estimated production figures for normal superphosphates were 0.003 Mt of P 

(Lauriene 2003), and the same for nitric phosphates. Direct uses of phosphate rock account for 

1 Mt of P on 2004 based on estimations from Villalha 2008. 

Statistical information indicates that 10% of P is lost in transportation and handling (Lauriente 

2003), this figure is 1.89 Mt P/yr in the year 2004. Villalha estimates 0.92 Mt P/yr is used in 

other uses of phosphate rock concentrate. 

 

5.3. Phosphorus flows on nature and human uses 
 

Most of phosphoric acid obtained by different process is used as fertilizer in crop lands, in 

Industry and household and also as feed grade additives. 

5.3.1. Crop Harvests 
The use of phosphates to nourish agricultural soils aims to replenish the removal of 

phosphorus from soil by harvests and erosion losses. Adopting the average phosphorus 

contents in crops and the harvest index (Smil, 1999), the global crop production harvested 12.7 

Mt P from soils in 2005; on the basis of the world agricultural production database (FAO 

2006a). 

Given that natural weathering and atmospheric deposition cannot compensate for the amount 

of phosphorus uptake from soils, application of phosphates, in both inorganic and organic 

forms, becomes essential to sustain today’s harvests. Although most inorganic phosphates 

applied to soils come from chemical fertilizers, the means of organic phosphorus reuse are 

diverse. The most direct means is to recycle crop residues in situ. If we assume that roughly 

half of the annual output of crop residues (mostly cereal straw) is not removed from fields, the 

amount of the direct reuse of crop residues on the soil is about 2.2 Mt P/yr (Yi Liu et al., 2008).  

 

According with the present flow chart the crop lost is 3 Mt P/yr, this value is consistent with a 

recent MFA (Cordell et al., 2009). 

 

5.3.2. Animal 
 

The animals are feed using the crop harvests, according to the global Food Balance Sheet (FBS) 

in 2003, livestock consumed 36% of the harvested cereals (excluding the amount of cereals 

processed for beer), 21% of the harvested starchy roots, and 20%of the harvested pulses (FAO, 

2006b). Consequently, the annual livestock consumption of phosphorus in the harvests 

accounted for about 2.9 Mt P/yr (Yi Liu et al., 2008).  

Apart from the consumption of crop harvests, the animals also graze the vegetation and the 

input is 12.1 Mt P/yr by (Cordell, 2009). 

 



 20 
  

The animals have an annual consumption via feed additives. Around 6% of global yield of 

phosphoric acid has been processed as animal feed-grade additives since 2000 (Brasnett, 2002; 

PotashCorp, 2004), so the input is 0.86 Mt P/yr. 

Some part of crop residues is used as animal fodder. The reuse ratio of crop residues (straws of 

rice, wheat, and corn) as fodder is very different in developed countries compared with 

developing countries. Given that 70% of world livestock are raised in developing countries, 

where commercial feeds are less used and the global recycling rate of crops straws as fodder is 

about 25% (Yi Liu et al. 2008), so we have 1.1 Mt P/yr. 

If we add all values above the total input on animal is around 17 Mt P/yr, taking in account 

that in developing countries usually they recycle various industrial byproducts and kitchen 

organic wastes, the value can be 20% higher (Yi Liu et al., 2008), resulting in a total of 20.4 Mt 

P/yr.   

 

The phosphorus flux to feed animals (excluding the grazing vegetation consumption) is mainly 

consumed by animals in confined facilities, whereas the world’s cultivated and natural 

pastures provide a major source of phosphorus for unconfined animals. Probably the 

maximum recoverable phosphorus for croplands comes from the confined animals (Yi Liu et 

al., 2008), recently Cordell estimates that 8 Mt of P/yr goes to recycling and 7 Mt of P/yr is lost 

on landfill and water.  

 

5.3.3. Household and Industry  
 

In this compartment we assume that the household and the Industry are connected, because 

the amount of production of phosphorus is used to produce chemicals, materials, detergents 

and posterior used in household. 

In the year 2004 the global production of phosphorus for uses in industry was 1.32 Mt/yr of P 

(Villalha et al., 2008).  

Calculations based on Smil (2000a, 2002) suggest the total phosphorus content in annual 

global agricultural harvests 7 Mt P/yr is processed for feed and food fibre, 2.9 Mt  of P/yr goes 

to feed animals (it was mentioned above) and 3.5 Mt of P/yr goes to the food commodities 

(Cordell et al., 2009). 

If we assume a global average dietary consumption of 1,400 mg P/capita, human excreta 

contains about 3.3 Mt P/yr, of which urban and rural populations generate 1.6 Mt P/yr and 1.7 

Mt P/yr, respectively (Liu et al., 2008). Cordell estimates that the organic solid waste from food 

communities is around 1.2 Mt of P/yr. Adding 3.3 Mt P/yr from human excreta, 1.2 Mt P/yr 

and consider that all P produced from industry (to make detergents and chemicals) is waste, 

the amount of household and industry is 5.82 Mt P/yr. 

There is also an output from the household and industry to the nature loss, this output is for 

example garden wastes, animal excreta (pets), and data from this amount of P loss was not 

available. 



 21 
  

 

5.3.4. Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) 
 

It is now even more important to recycle P from waste streams, in chapter 7; different ways to 

recycle P from waste streams is shown. 

It is estimated that 0.3 Mt P/yr can be recycle from the organic wastes (Cordell et al., 2009). It 

is also estimated that 10% (0.3 Mt P/yr) of human excreta can be recycle from human excreta, 

either intentionally or not, we have some examples from poor urban farmers in Pakistan 

diverting the city´s untreated wastewater to irrigate and fertilize the soils. These small 

amounts contribute a recycle flow of 0.5 Mt P/yr. The remainder is lost on landfill as sludge 

and organic waste (1.2 Mt P/yr as sludge and 1 Mt P/yr as organic waste), on MFA flow chart is 

a total of 2.2 Mt P/yr (Cordell et al. 2009), and going backwards on mass balance we obtain 

2.72 Mt P/yr lost as sewage (Cordell et al., 2009).  

The P content on the sludge and sewage can be recovery, is not considered as a loss on the 

nature. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 22 
  

 

5.4. The phosphorus resource reserve inventory 
 

The present agriculture is dependent on regular imputs of phosphate fertilizer derived from 

mined rock to replenish the phosphorus removed from the soil by growing and harvesting of 

crops. 

Every year the mine production increases because the world population is growing and the 

crops are not only for food supply but also for diferents uses, for example the production of 

biodiesel. As we can see on Fig. 8 untill the 1940s the utilization of phosphate rock was stable, 

but since 1950 the use has increased and the peaked production was in 1988 with 166 Mt of 

phosphate rock. During the 1990s, production dropped to low values (30 % decline) due to 

social-economic-political problems in the Eastern Block countries and also due to 

environmental pressures (Villalha et al., 2008). From 2001 onward, there has been growth at a 

rate that is projected to continue into the future (Lauriente 2003).  

 

 

Figure 8 – World Production of Phosphate Rock in Mt over the years, data from statistics of 

USGS.  

Three new phosphate rock mines are planned for development over the next decade in Florida 

to replace existing mines. The permitting process, however, has been delayed by opposition 

from local governments concerned about environmental and water use issues. In Idaho, one 

company received approval from the U.S. Forest Service to expand its mine and another 

company was developing a new mine to replace its existing mine that is near depletion. 

Worldwide phosphate rock production was estimated to have increased, primarily in China and 

North Africa (USGS, 2009).

China, United States, Morocco and Western Sahara, Russia are the biggest producer of mine 

production of phosphate rock. Phosphate rock resources occur principally as sedimentary 

marine phosphorites. The largest sedimentary deposits are found in northern Africa, China, the 

Middle East, and the United States. Significant igneous occurrences are found in Brazil, 

Canada, Russia, and South Africa. Large phosphate resources have been identified on the 

continental shelves and on seamounts in the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. High 

phosphate rock prices have renewed interest in exploiting offshore resources of Mexico and 

Namibia (USGS, 2009).  

Reserves of phosphorus can be reserve base or reserve. Reserve Base, representing the part of 

the identified resource that meets specified minimum physical and chemical criteria related to 

current mining and production practices (Fig. 9). Reserves, representing the part of the reserve 

base which could be economically extracted or produced at the time of determination (Fig. 

10). The term reserves need not signify that extraction facilities are in place and operative. 

Reserves include only recoverable materials (USGS, 2009).  

 

The availability of the reserves is affect also for political problems in the world. China has one 

of the most reserves of phosphate rock, and they have enough phosphate rock for own uses, 

the remained can be exported, but the export taxes from China government are very high, so 

the price of phosphate rock reach high values (questionnaire interview with Schjoerring, 2009).

The reserve estimated in 2009 was 15,000 Mt of phosphate rock or 1,963 Mt of P. If every year 

the mined phosphate rock is around 22 Mt/yr (phosphorus production on 2008 USGS 2009), 

and each year the consumption of phosphorus increases because of the food demand, the 

reserves of phosphate rock will be finished in about 90 years, or maybe even less. 

 

 

 
 

 
 

Figure 11 - Relationship between various scenarios for P2O5 consumption and the lifetime of 

reserves, assuming 2%, 2.5%, 3% and the most likely increase in P2O5 consumption (EFMA, 
2000). 

 

The two graphics above highlights very well that the use of phosphoric acid is increasing on the 

next years as the lifetime reserves is drop, and the year 2060, the phosphate rock could be 

exhausted at worst.

6. Value assessment/impact assessment  
 

In this chapter will discuss the different impacts in case of depletion of phosphate rock and its 

effects on the crop yields, humans and animals. It will show some ways to recovery P from 

waste streams and also technologies in order to reduce the environmental impact. 

The amount of phosphorus in the world’s soils is roughly 90×10
3
 to 200×10

3
 Mt P, according to 

various estimates. Although the total phosphorus content of soils is large, only a small fraction 

is available to biota in most soils. This constitutes an available phosphorus pool containing 

2,000 to 2,600 Mt P. A larger amount, in the range of 27×10
6
 to 840×10

6
 Mt P, can be found in 

the oceans. The sea water contains 80×10
3
 to 120×10

3
 Mt P, and the rest is accumulated in 

sediments (Liu et al., 2008). 

The distribution, dynamics, and availability of phosphorus in soil are controlled by a 

combination of biological, chemical, and physical processes. These processes deserve special 

attention, as a considerable proportion of the applied phosphate is transformed into insoluble 

calcium, iron, or aluminum phosphates. On average, only a small proportion, perhaps 15% to 

20% of the total amount of phosphorus in the plant, comes directly from the fertilizer applied 

to the crop. The remainder comes from soil reserves (Schjoerring; Yiu et all.2008) 

 

 

If the input of fertilizers in the soils is around 18 Mt P per year (data from the MFA flow chart) 

and 20% of P on the plant comes from the fertilizers. Considering that the amount of P 

consumed for crop production is 12 Mt of P per year, the crops only use 2.4 Mt P/yr from the 

fertilizers. We can thus conclude that per year we have 15.4 Mt P/yr of losses from the 

fertilizer input as show in Fig. 12.

6.1. Consequences of phosphorus depletion 
 

A deficit of phosphorus affects not only plant grow and its development but also the crop 

yields, along with affecting the quality of seeds. Deficiency can also delay the ripening of crops 

which can set back the harvests, risking the quality of the product. 

 

To successfully produce the next generations of plants, seeds or grains must store phosphorus 

so that the seedling has enough to develop its first roots and shoots. Then, as the root system 

develops, the growing plant will be able to take up the phosphorus it requires from the soil, 

providing the adequate reserves (EMFA, 2000).  

 

 

The effect on crop yields can be seeing (Table 3) on the simple experiment done in 1899 on 

fertilizer deficit soil in England.

Analyzing the results of the experiment, we can see that with only nitrogen the crop yields are 

better, but by also adding phosphorus the final result is much better. So phosphorus addition 

increases the production 2.3 times. 

 

6.1.1. Plant nutrition  
 

The relationship between plant nutrition, soil texture, root growth, and the availability of 

nutrients in the soil can influence the efficient use of phosphorus in agriculture. 

 

Plant nutrition, is considered in terms of the individual elements required by the plant. These 

include nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, carbon, sulphur, hydrogen and many others. Plant 

roots take up all nutrients from the aqueous solution in the soil apart from carbon, hydrogen 

and oxygen, which are acquired from carbon dioxide in the air via the leaves and the water in 

the soil (Fig. 13) (EFMA, 2000).  

 
 

 

 



 28 
  

The root hair is very important for the nutrients uptake to the plant, if the soil is not fertile in 

phosphorus, it can influence the development of root plant. On a document of EFMA is shown 

an example of root development of the same plant on different soils. On Fig. 13 is evident the 

development of root plant on fertile phosphorus soil (a) and the poor development on soil 

without phosphorus (EFMA, 2000). 

 

But as is shown on plant (b) the roots can be less developed but agricultural specialist believe 

that the plant can adapt in case the soil P is not available, for example the main root hair is 

more extended to uptake P from other soil layers with no deficit on the plant (Questionnaire 

Interview with Schjoerring, 2009).

6.2. Questionnaire  
 

 

In order to understand better the relations between the P on the soil and the P available on 

the soils, and also to understand the consequences/impact on the crops, humans feed and 

animal production, a questionnaire was prepared to present to two agricultural specialists, 

Gitte Rubæk from University of Aarhus and Jan Schjorring from The University of Copenhagen.  

 

The main questions are as follows: 

 

1) From the P pool in the soil, I would like to have more information/understanding 
about the equilibrium between the P available and the P not available for plants. 

a. What happens to the crops yield when the minimum P dosage stops but P 
available to plants is present in the soil?  

b. What happens to the crops yield (both for humans and animals) when the 
minimum P dosage has stopped and the P available to plants in no more 

present in the soil? 

 

(a) (b) 



 29 
  

We suppose that when the minimum P dosage stops, there will be a gradual drop in crop yields 

(for both humans and animals), however, after the P available to plants in the soil has been 

used up, there will be a gradual drop in crop yields, but a big drop on animal yield, because we 

think that not only the crop yield will be drop, put also the P percentage contained in the crops 

(if there is less available P on the soil influence the uptake plant). So if the P Percentage in the 

crops is less, possible will be influenced the development of the animals. On the humans we 

think that a drop of P on the crop yield will not influence, because the P intake of the humans 

it’s bigger than recommended daily intake.  

The following diagrams highlight this hypothesis. 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2) We understand that the changes in the P pool are based on the differences in space 
and time, depending on various places, soil types, crops etc. How should be explained 

the above hypothesis keeping this in mind? 

3) There are several technologies available for mitigating the problem of P depletion and 
decrease of P in the P Pool. Some of them are – 

a. Enhancing P recycling – from waste streams such as Meat &amp;amp; Bone Meal, 
wastewater sludge, human excreta, etc. 

b. Enhancing P uptake – from the addition of an enzyme that enhances phosphate 
fertility. 

c. Enhancing P uptake of plants by genetic modifications. 
4) Do you have any information about Danish experiences and test fields which were 

being studied for soil fertility with regard to P without the addition of any fertilizer. I 

was informed about such studies by my supervisor.

From the answers that we got from the agricultural specialists, the hypothesis is discussed with 

different scenarios projecting the consequences if the phosphorus reserves are depleted. 

These are some of the qualitative projected scenarios.     

6.2.1. Hypothesis for the consequences on the crops 
 

The impacts of phosphorus depletion on crop yields depends on the different kind of soils such 

as overfertilized soils, tropical soils where the availability of P is reduced, the type of crops 

produced. Agronomists agree that the differences in the input of P will affect the crop yield 

and the reduction in P input will lead to reduction in crop yield.

Figure 14 – Graphic showing the possible consequence on the crop yields in case of no 

fertilization during a long time, on general soils. 

 

If the input of fertilizer stops, on general soil, the crop yields will drop until P is available on the 

soil. After reaching the time that is not P available on the soils the crop yields will decline more 

(fig. 14), but both agronomists, agree that in these case the plants will have a period of 

adaptation, and the roots hair will be longer to uptake P from other levels of the soil.

Figure 15 – Graphic showing possible consequence on the crop yields in case of no fertilization 

during a long time, in overfertilize soils. 

 

In case of overfertilize soils, e.g. recycle animal manure , or an input of P fertilizer above of 

requirement needs of the soil, it is not expect a big drop of crop yields and the time of P 

available on the soil will be bigger than in general soils (Fig. 15). In this situation it will take 

longer to finish the P available.

during a long time, on too low available P on the soil. 

 

If the soil has too low available P, as tropical soils, the P is not available in solution but it is 

adsorbed with different compounds, it is expected a reduction on the start and then a steep 

reduction when it is finishing the P available. However, it will be an equilibrium at a level too 

low to sustain viable production, and then a very low level of yield (Fig. 16). The lag phase 

between no fertilizer P input and not available P on the soil will be shorter than the soils 

described above.

6.2.2. Consequence of Human and Animal  
 

Humans and animals also need to obtain an adequate supply of phosphorus from their food 

and feeding stuffs. Phosphorus deficiency affects many of the essential processes on which the 

life of an animal depends, just as it does in plants. Phosphates are added to the diet of pigs and 

poultry to ensure they do not suffer any deficiency, and to prevent health problems, weak 

bones and impaired fertility. 

 

Because much of the phosphorus ingested by animals is excreted in the faeces, animal 

manures, when properly used, are valuable sources of phosphorus. Phosphorus is the second 

most abundant mineral element in the human body (the first is calcium), accounting for more 

than 20 percent of the body’s minerals. Calcium phosphates, for example, are the major 

constituent of the skeletal bones and teeth and contain 85% of the body’s total phosphorus. 

Lack of phosphorus not only affects bone structure, but also appetite, growth and fertility 

(EFMA 2000).  

 

Above, on the questions, we thought that we will have a decrease not only on the crops yields 

but also a big impact on animals, but the decreased input of phosphorus will reduce grain yield 

much more than the P percentage in the grain.  

 

On the Human, even the percentage in the grain is less, it will not be such big impact in the 

humans, because the typical daily consumption is 1,500 mg P/capita for adults. This is well 

above the dietary reference intake (DRI), the amount a human individual should take in each 

day, as recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine, a part of 

the U.S. National Academy of Science. The U.S. recommended intakes are 700 mg/capita for 

adults over 18 years of age, 1,250 mg/capita for young adults between 9 and 18 years of age, 

and 500 mg/capita for children (Villalha et al., 2008).  

 

As an answer of the questionnaire Schjoerring believes that the impact on animals doesn’t 

make sense, e.g. the monogastric animals, like pigs, they are not able to digest the P content 

on the crops, for which they are given P supplements in their feed. Less P in the crops will 

mean either additional supplements will need to be provided to the animals or there may be 

less loss of P to the environment via animal excreta causing lesser environmental impacts.

6.3. Long-Term Experiments in different countries  
 

A different experiment has been performed in order to evaluate soil and crops performance 

with or without fertilizer.   

6.3.1. Denmark  
 

In Denmark it has being developed a study about crop and soil P (in eight fields experiments 

initiated in 1975) to long-term P fertilization strategies at typical Danish agricultural soils. One 

of the main objectives was to determine for how long P fertilization could be omitted without 

affecting yields, carried out by Gitte Holton Rubæk and Erik Sibbesen.  

The P treatments were 0 kg P ha

 every fifth year as super phosphate. Nitrogen was also applied as well other plant 

nutrients, lime and pesticides according to needs.  

The effects of P and N fertilization on crop yields were tested with an ante-dependence 

analysis of covariance on the relative yields. With this analysis it is possible to deduct 

information   on where the time profiles of the treatments differ from each other.  This 

analysis is a modified multivariate analysis, and therefore it does not depend on variance 

homogeneity, independence of data or sphericity of the residuals as traditional or adapted 

univariate analysis or variance do. The first step in the ante-dependence analysis is 

determination of the order or structure of ante-dependence. This means determining the 

lowest number of previous measurements, which improves the model significantly, when 

include as covariates.  If the order of covariance is one, only the measurement of the 

preceding year will be included in the analysis as covariate. If the order of ante-dependence is 

two, the two preceding years will be included as covariates and so on. An ante-dependence 

structure of zero will result in a univarate analysis of variance with no correction on previous 

years.

Note: P is in kg P ha

. 

Analyzing the table 4 with data of this long-term experiment it was proved that P-fertilization 

had no significant overall effects on the crop yields at any experimental sites before 1990. 

From 1990 and onwards the overall effect of P fertilization were significant at Rønhave, 

Tylstrup and Borris. In all cases, except at Borris in 1992, the yields were significantly lower in 

the 0 kg P ha

 in the later years at the 

stations were also yields were depressed (Rubæk and Sibbesen, 2000). 

 

6.3.2. Finland  
 

Since 1978 a farm in southern Finland is being used to analyze the growing of cereals without 

fertilization of potassium and phosphorus, during thirty years. The soil had been cultivated 

conventionally for decades before the experiment started. 

The goal of this project was to investigate how long it would take before a deficiency of the 

major nutrients phosphorus and potassium occurred under conditions associated with 

traditional crop production methods.  

 

The design of the experiment consists of two factors with two levels each: without and with 

phosphorus and potassium fertilizer (36 and 70 kg ha
-1

 yr
-1

, respectively) as well as without and 

with an extra superphosphate application (P 36 kg ha
-1

 yr
-1

). The treatments were replicated at 

least 4 times. They were arranged in plots of 20 by 15 m or 5 by 15 m (extra superphosphate). 

Nitrogen has been applied at 100 kg ha
-1

 yearly.  

 



 36 
  

On the end, the results of the total dry matter yield (grain + straw) decreased from about 5000 

kg ha
-1

 to a level of 3000 kg ha
-1

 when only nitrogen was applied. After 30 years of nitrogen 

and phosphorus fertilizer the yield level was 4000 kg ha
-1

. NPK application kept the yield level 

almost constant. The surplus annual P rate of 70 kg ha
-1

 seemed to increase the yield a little 

more.  

 

Over thirty years a significant depletion of P and K in soil occurred when they were not given in 

fertilizers. This caused a reduction in crop yield. An abundant P application has exceeded the 

crop uptake very clearly prevented the yield reduction but did not raise the extractable P 

concentration in the soil. Severe K deficiency did not start to appear until 20 years of growing 

cereal without fertilizer K. K application compensating for the uptake by the crop did not 

prevent the decrease of its extractable concentration in this soil, but this decrease did not 

affect crop yield (Jaakkola, 1997).

7. Options for sustainable phosphorus use and management 
 

Common responses to resource scarcity problems include higher prices, more efficient 

resource use, the introduction of alternatives, and the recovery of the resource after use. The 

use of phosphorus is becoming more efficient, especially in Europe. Farmers in Europe and 

North America are increasingly avoiding over fertilization, and are plugging straw and animal 

manure into agricultural soils, partly to recycle phosphorus (Cordell et al., 2009).  

 

At this moment, it is important to figure out if it is possible to reduce the waste streams from P 

cycle, and if it is not possible to reduce the waste, it is important to develop methodologies to 

recover P from waste streams or recycle. 

On chapter 3, analyzing the MFA flow chart we can see that a large amount of P is lost in the 

nature during the cycle. Before the phosphorus reserve be exhausted, is important to reduce, 

as possible, the depletion of P. 

The phosphorus can be recovered from the food production and consumption system and 

reused as a fertilizer either directly or after intermediate processing. As example, P can be 

recovered and/or reused from: 

• Plugging crop residues back into the soil; 
• Food processing plants and food retailers; 
• Human and animal excreta; 
• Meat and bone meal; 
• Manure fibre; 
• Sewage sludge; 
• Wastewater.  

To increase the life expectancy of world´s phosphorus resources we have two possibilities, 

recycling by recovery from municipal and other waste products, the second one is improving 

the efficient use in agriculture of both phosphatic mineral fertilizer and animal manure (Cordell 

et al., 2009).  

Some countries have already programs to recycle waste. At least a municipal waste water 

treatment plant in Portugal is processing the sludge to sell as fertilizer. In some cities from 

Pakistan and Asia, more than 25% of urban vegetables are irrigate with them own wastewater 

(Cordell et al., 2009). There are different studies about reuse and recycle of rich phosphorus 

streams, on this chapter it will be mentioned some of them.

7.1. Phosphorus Recovery from Biological Sewage sludge ash using a 
wet sulfuric acid process  

The aim of Michael’s project (Phosphorus Recovery from Biological Sewage sludge ash using a 

wet sulfuric acid process) was to examine phosphorus recovery from biological sewage sludge 

ash using a wet sulphuric acid process as recovery method. Different process steps as well as 

specific parameters influencing the possibility of recovering phosphorus from sewage sludge 

ash were identified: 

• The waste water treatment process 
o Use of precipitation chemicals 
o Phosphorus content of the sludge 

 

• The incineration process 
o Incineration temperature 

 

• Recovery of phosphorus by the sulphuric acid 
o Acid concentration 
o Temperature 
o Stirring 
o Particle size 

Biological waste water treatment produces sewage sludge with higher phosphorus 

concentration than traditional waste water treatment and furthermore elimination of 

precipitation chemicals minimizes the iron and aluminum content this is highly desirable when 

recovering phosphorus. Analysis of dried sewage sludge Analysis of ash from biological sewage 

sludge from Helsingborg, VA-Verket shows that the ash contains 37 % P2O5. This is almost 

twice the amount of the phosphorus in ash from traditional sewage sludge and above the 

minimum criteria for P2O5 in low grade rock phosphate. Biological sewage sludge ash is 

reported to have an iron content of as little as 1.6%. The iron content in Helsingborg ash is 

5.7% this is 23% lower than ash from Lynetten incineration plant.  The biological sewage sludge 

ash fulfilled all threshold values given by the Danish sludge regulations. 

The incineration temperature influences the plan availability of the phosphorus. When 

incineration temperature is increased from 500?C to 700?C the plant availability decreases. 

Incinerating dried, biological sewage sludge from Helsingborg at a temperature of 875?C, the 

amount of plant available phosphorus is reduced by a factor 40. Phosphorus is found as 

hydroxyapatite in the ash.  

 A series of experiments of phosphorus recovery from biological sewage sludge were carried 

out. The main influential parameters on the sulphuric acid recovery process are stirring, 

particle size, sulphuric acid concentration and temperature. The experiments showed that it is 

possible to recover 40 % of the phosphorus in the ash. High sulphuric acid concentration may 

have caused coating and hampered the recovery of phosphorus. The produced phosphoric 

acids had an average P2O5 concentration of 4.4 %. Analysis showed that the threshold values in 

the Danish Sludge regulation were fulfilled. After a concentration step yielding a tenfold 



 39 
  

increase in P2O5 concentration the threshold values were still fulfilled and furthermore 

specifications for low grade rock phosphate were fulfilled. 

The technical feasibility analysis states that biological waste water treatment without addition 

of precipitations chemicals is technical feasible when the discharge threshold value for 

phosphorus given by the local municipalities is above 0.4 mg P/L. Incineration of sewage 

sludge is well established  and considered technical feasible. Recovery of phosphorus from 

sewage sludge ash as phosphoric acid by reaction with sulphuric acid is considered technical 

feasible and 40 - 90% recovery is expected. 

The economical feasibility analysis states that the process generates a surplus of 240 DKK per 

ton of sewage sludge ash, with a total depreciable plant cost of 29,340,000 DKK (Michael, 

2009).  

 

7.2. Reuse of human an animal excreta 
 

As was mentioned on chapter 3, human excreta can be reuse intentionally or not. Since a long 

time the Chinese people used the human excreta to fertilize the soils. Nowadays, technologies 

are being developed to recovery human urine. According with Swedish and Zimbabwe studies 

the nutrients of one persons’ urine is sufficient to grow 50- 100% of the food requirements of 

another person (Cordell et all.2008).   

Urine is a very useful waste, it can be use as a fertilizer because content a lot of the most 

important nutrients to fertilize the soil, with a percentage of 80% of nitrogen, 55% of 

phosphorus and 60% of potassium , as it is shown on Fig. 17 an example from Sweden. 

 

Figure 17 – Content of major plant nutrients and volume in Swedish domestic waste water. 

Daily mean excretion per person and day is: 14 g N, 2 g P and 4 g K in a volume of 150-200 liter. 

(Graphic from WHO 2009). 

 

Sweden is a good example of reusing urine, on the beginners of 1990 porcelain urine-diverting 

toilets ware introduced.  This system constitutes on separate flushing mechanism for the urine 

and faeces or the flush rinses both bowls. The faeces may also be collected dry for composting. 



 40 
  

The urine is usually collected in a tank placed underground or in a basement under the house. 

When the tank is full the urine is transported to a farm for later use as a fertilizer on 

agricultural land. Before its utilization the urine is stored either in the housing area or near the 

field, on the Fig. 18 is shown a scheme. For individual households the urine may also be 

utilized in the garden directly from the collection tank, without separate storage. 

Investigations were conducted on both small-scale and large-scale systems (WHO, 2009).   

 

 

 
Figure18 – Swedish scheme to recovery human urine. (From WHO 2009) 

 

Nowadays, not only in Sweden is being develop reuse of human excreta. In Zimbabwe was 

developed toilets that make compost for the crops, most of the rural population of Africa do 

not have access to safe and reliable toilets , so it is a good way to create sanitary safety and 

reuse the nutrients to the crops with low-cost (EcoSanRes 2007). 

 

World Health Organization (WHO) has guidelines in order to minimize the risks for 

transmission of infectious diseases and as a part of risk management. These guidelines are 

recommendations an them involve parameters such the possible pathogens on the urine 

depending on the temperature and time of storage, and recommended crops (WHO, 2009).

7.3. Novozymes 
 

Consider that at this moment P exists in two main pools of phosphorus, the phosphate rock 

reserve and the phosphorus pool on the soil (P available to plants uptake). Taking account that 

one day the reserve may be finished, is important to have an idea of how the problem can be 

managed. 

 

On the soil we have phosphorus unavailable to 

fertilize, however there is on the market a fungus 

able to transform the phosphorus available (Fig. 

19).  

When phosphate fertilizer is applied at the time 

of planting, it can quickly bind with calcium, 

magnesium, and iron minerals in the soil, 

resulting in the phosphate being inaccessible to 

the crop. In that moment JumpStart can be 

applied on the soils. 

 

 Figure 19 – JumpStart is a phosphate inoculant. (Novozymes 2009) 

 

JumpStart is a fertility management tool that is applied as a seed treatment to the seed prior 

to planting or with the seed at planting. The active component in JumpStart is a naturally 

occurring soil fungus – Penicillium bilaii. As the seeds germinate and develop a root system the 

JumpStart fungus and the plant form a mutually beneficial relationship. The fungus grows and 

multiplies along the crop roots, thriving off the root exudates and releasing organic acids into 

the soil. These acids break the bonds holding the phosphate nutrient in a mineral form, 

releasing the phosphate into a form the plant can access. The result is enhanced phosphate 

uptake allowing the crop to achieve its yield potential. 

 

Cool soils, during direct or early seeding, can reduce phosphate availability due to the limited 

mobility or movement of phosphate in the soil. Poor early season phosphate availability can 

reduce early growth. JumpStart is active in cool soils as low as 4 °C and supplies an 

immediately available source of phosphate to developing seedlings, resulting in quicker 

emergence and early vigor. 

JumpStart has been commercially available to North America farmers for more than 10 years, 

where it was used on approximately 5.0 million acres in 2008. In over 450 split field trials 

conducted in North America over the last 15 years, “JumpStart” has shown an average 5% to 

7% yield increase on a number of different crops (Novozymes, 2009).  

 

 

 



 42 
  

8. Conclusions 
 

As a main conclusion of this work the phosphorus is a real environmental problem nowadays, 

in my opinion it is important to develop more research work in different points of the world. It 

is important work with farmers in order to inform the best ways to apply the fertilizers on the 

soil to reduce as much it is possible the use of fertilizers and maybe develop international 

rules. 

The MFA flow chart can show that we have a lot of waste streams and they can be recovered 

and reduce the need of phosphate rock and also the phosphate’s losses on the soil.  

It was discussed that the phosphorus depletion can reduce the crop yields and the plant must 

develop root to find P on another soil level. However it will not interfere on human and animal 

consumption. 

Companies like Novozymes, Kommunekemi and also techniques like the human excreta 

recovery from Sweden are a good example how we can reduce waste streams rich in P and 

reduce environmental impacts, such eutrophication. But we still have to develop more
