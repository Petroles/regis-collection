Abstract
The Deccan Traps volcanism has been pointed as a potential cause for the Cretaceous-Tertiary (KT) mass extinction. A major limitation resides in the paucity of direct Deccan volcanism markers and in the geologically short interval where both impact and volcanism occurs, making it hard to evaluate their contributions to the mass extinction. Recently, a new marker for the Deccan Traps has been found just below the KT boundary at Bidart and Gubbio and is identified as aeolian akaganeite interpreted to be formed by interaction of Deccan aerosols with the high atmosphere and latter transported to Bidart and Gubbio via the stratosphere. This akaganeite occurs within an interval of low magnetic susceptibility (MS) interpreted to result from the dissolution of detrital magnetite by Deccan-induced acid rains. Here we conducted an environmental magnetic study of several KT sections worldwide, marine (Tethys) and continental (India) in order to: i) verify the presence of the low MS interval and akaganeite in sediments close and distal to the Deccan and ii) unravel the associated paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic changes. In Bidart and Gubbio, our results confirmed the presence of the low magnetic susceptibility interval coincident with the presence of akaganeite and show that it well corresponds to a loss of detrital magnetite. In Uruxa and Sopelana (Basque Country), the results are inconclusive, probably due to the tectonic deformation and chemical alteration that affected the area. In Iran, we located for the first time the position of the KTB, which is well marked by an abrupt shift in MS values between the Maastrichtian marls and the Danian carbonates. However, no low MS interval has been found there. In the continental (lacustrine) sediments interbedded within the Deccan lavas, higher weathering rates are observed in the Podgawan section (Phase 2) and inferred from the presence of more than four magnetic phases identified after unmixing Isothermal Remanent Magnetization curves. In this section, we found an enigmatic level of high MS corresponding to an abrupt change in facies and color, namely the presence of a black coal level capped by reddish clays, which may be formed by the action of wildfire just after the bolide impact (KTB). This new discovery may definitively link the age of the impact with the age of the Deccan Phase 2.

Resumo
O vulcanismo da Província Magmática do Deccan, na Índia, foi um dos mais intensos na história da Terra, e extende-se por uma área comparável à da França com montanhas com cerca de 3500 m de altura. A partir dos anos 80, o Deccan foi considerado como sendo o responsável pela extinção em massa do Cretáceo-Terciário (KT), que coincide com a extinção dos dinossauros e com o impacto do Chicxulub na Província do Yucatan, México. Apesar do consenso de que o impacto e o vulcanismo do Deccan ocorreram num intervalo de tempo restricto, a contribuição de cada evento na extinção em massa do KT é ainda mal constringido. A grande limitação passa por não existirem ainda marcadores directos que liguem o vulcanismo do Deccan à extinção em massa e a proximidade temporal entre o evento do Chicxulub e do Deccan, o que torna complicado avaliar qual foi o responsável pela mesma.
Recentemente, foi descoberto que o Deccan ocorreu em três principais mega pulsos, que chamamos de fase 1, 2 e 3. Segundo Chenet et al. (2007) a fase 2 ocorreu há cerca de 65.0±0.3 Ma e foi responsável por cerca de 80% do total de lava, enquanto a fase 1 e 3 juntas contribuíram com os restantes 20%. Baseado em fósseis de plantas, Wilf et al. (2003) descobriu a ocorrência de 2 episódeos de aquecimento global, o maior durante o final do Maastrichtiano e que terá terminado alguns milhares de anos antes da fronteira Cretácico-Terciário (KTB). Robinson et al. (2009) correlacionou um diminuição na razão 187Os/188Os no final do Maastrichtiano com a fase 2 do Deccan e valores negativos de ô13C reflectem um volume enorme de CO2 emitido para a atmosfera. Tal provocou um ambiente de stress climático que poderá ter contribuído para a extinção em massa do KT. Existe deste modo um consenso elevado que a fase mais activa do Deccan aconteceu pouco antes do KTB. O problema reside na nossa incapacidade de localizar com precisão a posição estratigráfica do vulcanismo do Deccan nos sedimentos marinhos onde está preservado o limite KT. Efectivamente, se o impacto é bem marcado em sequências marinhas do mundo inteiro pelo nível de irídium, os marcadores do Deccan (ejecta, microesferas, etc.) limitam-se as áreas geográficas próximas à província magmática.
Recentemente, Font et al. (2011) propôs um novo marcador para o vulcanismo do Deccan em sedimentos marinhos distantes. Nesse trabalho foi descoberto um intervalo de baixa susceptibilidade magnética precisamente antes do KTB na secção de Bidart. Nesse intervalo as curvas de Magnetização Remanescente Isotérmica (MRI) detectaram uma componente de alta coercividade, um mineral que foi posteriormente identificado usando microscopia electrónica como sendo akaganeite (Font et al., 2013). Os autores interpretaram a formação da akaganeite como sendo o produto de uma reacção entre a pluma vulcânica e a alta atmosfera. Modelos numéricos recentemente mostraram também que no caso de Deccan, apesar de não ser um vulcanismo explosivo, a quantidade de CO2 e de calor é tal, que cria uma pluma vulcânica capaz de ultrapassar a tropopausa. Sendo que a velocidade de transporte dos aerossóis na estratosfera é muito maior que na troposfera, isto explicaria o seu transporte até Bidart (Baía da Biscaia) e Gubbio (Itália). A descoberta da akaganeite e do intervalo de baixa susceptibilidade magnética tem implicações cruciais na avaliação da contribuição do Deccan na extinção em massa do KT, de tal maneira que este modelo precisa ser testado e aplicado a outras secções KT do mundo.
Neste trabalho usámos o magnetismo ambiental em secções KT marinhas com o objectivo de verificar a presença do intervalo de baixa susceptibilidade magnética e da akaganeite noutras secções KT do mundo (Gubbio, Irão, Sopelana e Uruxa). De modo a comparar a assinatura magnética de sedimentos marinhos e continentais da idade da fase 2 e a inferir acerca das condições paleoambientais, foram igualmente analisadas secções de sedimentos lacustres provenientes da província magmática do Deccan. Os métodos utilizados basearam-se em aquisição de dados de Magnetização Remanescente Isotérmica (MRI), que foram posteriormente tratados com o software da Kruiver et al. (2001), susceptibilidade magnética (SM), curvas termomagnéticas e dados de DRS, isto é, espectrofotometria da reflecção difusa.
Já os resultados mais importantes nos sedimentos continentais da Índia dizem respeito à secção de Podgawan, onde os sedimentos foram depositados na fase 2 do Deccan. Nessa secção, na análise das curvas MRI usando o tratamento CLG proposto por Kruiver et al. (2001) observa-se a presença de várias (entre 4 a 5) componentes mineralógicas. Essas componentes são geralmente de baixa coercividade, o que nos leva a interpretar como sendo magnetite com vários tamanhos de grão. Essa heterogeneidade terá resultado de uma intensa erosão/alteração da magnetite provocada por um ambiente de stress (pCO2 elevadas, chuvas ácidas, por exemplo). Uma análise às mesmas amostras feita por Fantasia (2013) concluiu que é precisamente em Podgawan que os índices de alteração química (CIA) são mais elevados, o que é concordante com a nossa interpretação. Igualmente a partir da secção de Podgawan foi possível sugerir a presença eventual do limite KTB marcada por uma mudança brusca da cor e da mineralogia magnética dos sedimentos num espaço de apenas 13 cm. Estes níveis correspondem a sucessão estratigráfica de um nível preto de carvão seguido de argilas vermelhas. O nível de carvão preto pode ter sido depositado após os incêndios gerados pela radiação térmica libertada durante o impacto do Chicxulub, enquanto que o nível vermelho corresponde a um nível rico em pigmentos de hematite e sem matéria orgânica. Fotografias de microscopia electrónica deste nível vermelho, recentemente publicadas, mostram que o mesmo pode ser resultado da forte alteração de superfície devido a ausência da cobertura vegetal. Se esta hipótese se confirmar no futuro, será a primeira evidência indiscutível que demonstra que a Fase 2 do Deccan é quase síncrona com o impacto do Chicxulub.

1. Introduction
The Deccan Traps volcanism is one of the most important Large Igneous Province (LIP) in Earth's history. This importance is recorded today in India, where the exposures of lava cover an area comparable to the size of France and form mountain peaks of 3500 m high despite the erosion suffered through the years. Some of the biggest eruptions spread about 1500 km across India, forming the longest lava flows known on Earth (Self et al., 2008). Due to its magnitude, some scientists pointed the Deccan volcanism as the cause (or at least the major contributor) of the Cretaceous-Tertiary (KT) mass extinction (Courtillot et al., 1986).
When Alvarez et al. (1980) discovered an Iridium anomaly in a thin clay layer at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (KTB), a new theory for the KT mass extinction was born. Iridium is commonly found in extra-terrestrial material (asteroids, comets, cosmic dust or impact ejecta), but very rare on Earth. Alvarez et al. (1980) thus suggest that the mass extinction was attributed to a bolide impact. The impact theory was further reinforced by the discovery in early 1990s of the Chicxulub crater (Hildebrand et al., 1991) and the impact spherule ejecta in Haiti and NE Mexico (Izett et al., 1991). Despite the large acceptation of the impact theory by the scientific community, it has been challenged by proponents of the idea that the Deccan Magmatic province may have contributed or even triggered the KT mass extinction.

The crater and the impact spherules discovery proved that an impact occurred, undoubtedly. However, there were still problems dating the Chicxulub impact to confirm that it was precisely of a KT age (i.e. mass extinction boundary). Impact craters are difficult to date with high precision, so the first impact dates were based on 39Ar/40Ar ages. But this method still have about ±1% of error, which may lead to a total error of ±500 ky for the KTB, an uncertainty that is too large to identify the Chicxulub impact as KT age. Additionally, most of the impact theory is based on the presence of a sandstone complex that has been found at NE Mexico between the impact spherule layer (ISL) and the Iridium layer (Fig. 2). Supposedly, the ISL should be a marker of the KTB as the spherules are result of the immediate deposition of the impact ejecta emissions, together with the Iridium layer. The sandstone complex was therefore explained as being the result of mega-tsunami waves generated by the impact, with the Iridium settling during the next weeks (Smit et al. (1992)).
Fig. 2 - The Sandstone Complex found in a section at NE Mexico, between the ISL and the KTB (Gerta Keller, Earth Life, 2012).
However, the mega-tsunami theory has been questioned when Adatte et al. (1996) performed a detailed sedimentologic analysis of the sandstone complex in several sections in USA and Mexico, which revealed long-term deposition with multiple storm-related erosion, suggesting a sea-level imprint and so a much larger deposition time for the sandstone complex. The sea-level fall also explains some impact spherules found in the sandstone complex, during Late Maastrichtian (bellow KPB), because sea-level changes are associated with strong erosion, transport and re-deposition of sediments. These results indicate that if the ISL has not the same age than the Iridium anomaly, and if the sandstone complex located between them is not a mega-tsunami but encompassed a larger interval of deposition time, then either two bolide impacts must be evocated or the Chicxulub must predate the KTB. On this base, Keller et al. (2003) suggested that Chicxulub impact must predate the KTB. If the relation between the Chicxulub impact, the Iridium anomaly and the mass extinction is hard to unravel in continental regions close to the impact, it is even harder for distal marine sections. Indeed, if the mass extinction is not well record in continental section (due to erosion and absence of well-dated fossils), it is well marked in marine sections by a typical negative anomaly of 513C and by abrupt change in planktonic foraminifera (Keller et al., 2008). In these marine sections, the Chicxulub impact is well identified by the peak in Iridium but there is no mineralogical or geochemical marker for the Deccan.
A crucial problem is the age of Deccan volcanism. Recently, Chenet et al. (2007, 2008) propose that Deccan volcanism occurred in three short mega-pulses, called Phase 1, 2 and 3. The second pulse is responsible for nearly 80% of the total Deccan eruptions, with the first and third pulse contributing together for 20% (Fig. 3). The authors calculated a mean age of 67.5 Ma for the Phase 1; 65.0±0.3 Ma for the Deccan phase 2, that corresponds to the C29r (magnetic polarity data); and 64.7 Ma for the Phase 3 and corresponding to the boundary between chron 29n and 29r. Based on the record of the paleosecular variations of individual lava flows, Chenet et al. (2008) suggest a very short eruption duration for the Deccan Phase 2 (on the order of thousands of years). These huge volumes of lava and associated CO2 and acid aerosol emissions should have got a critical impact on the biosphere.
Fig. 3 -The age and relative thickness of Deccan lava flows for its three different phases (Chenet et al. 2007)
Even if direct markers of the Deccan effect are still lacking, there are several indirect evidences that suggest the Deccan Phase 2 precede the KTB by some 100-200 kyr (Fig. 4). Based on fossil plant material, Wilf et al. (2003) detected a warming event (with an abrupt increase of 2-4°C) at the late Maastrichtian, which ended ~20-50 kyr before the KTB. Stable carbon and oxygen isotopes from paleosol carbonates indicate the occurrence of two greenhouse episodes with high atmospheric CO2 levels, at 70 to 69 Ma and 500 kyr prior to KTB, respectively. Additionally, a major drop in the marine 187Os/188Os record in chron 29r at different geographic locations suggests a correlation between the end-Maastrichtian warming event and the Deccan Phase 2 (Robinson et al., 2009). Therefore, there is some consensus that the Deccan phase-2 occurred just before the KTB.

The main problem thus resides in our incapacity to locate the stratigraphic position of sediments deposited during the Deccan Phase 2. This is due to the lack of direct mineralogical indicators since volcanic markers, such as aerosols or ejecta, are generally restricted to the vicinity of the crater. However, a recent study using environmental magnetism show an abrupt decrease of the magnetic susceptibility (MS) just below the KTB together with the presence of an enigmatic Cl-bearing iron oxide identified by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM, Fig.5). In this interval, Isothermal Remanent Magnetization (IRM) showed the presence of a very coercive phase consistent with antiferromagnetic akaganeite and a drastic decrease in magnetite content characterizing the low MS interval. This mineral is proposed to be akaganeite (Font et al., 2013), and is now regarded as a possible Deccan volcanism marker. A model for the akaganeite formation had been suggested as being the result of the interaction between the volcanic plume aerosols with the upper atmosphere. The akaganeite would have been transported through the stratosphere (Kaminski et al., 2010) and deposited in Bidart, far from the original volcanic source. A numeric model of alteration suggests that a dissolution mechanism in the continents may explain the magnetite loss (low MS interval) in the interval where akaganeite has been found. This method is highly promising to localize the Deccan Phase-2 in sedimentary sections and needs to be applied in other KT sections around the world.

The main objective of this work is to study the magnetic mineralogy of some KT sections worldwide (Gubbio in Italy, Galanderud in Iran, Bidart, Uruxa and Sopelana in the Basque Country) in order to verify the presence of akaganeite and of a low MS interval that can be correlated to Deccan phase 2. In addition we investigate lacustrine sediments (Daiwal River, Dhapewada, Anjar and Podgawan) interstratified within the Deccan lavas (Phase 1 and Phase 2) from India in order to check for the presence of akaganeite in very proximal section but also to unravel local paleoenvironmental conditions (such as acid rains) in the vicinity of the Deccan. Our results will bring new insights in the problematic of the Deccan volcanism and its role on KT mass extinction.
2.	Geological Settings
2.1	Basque Country
2.1.1	Bidart
The Bidart section is considered one of the most complete KT sections in Europe. It belongs to the Basque-Cantabric basin, a deep sea basin. The sedimentation is hemipelagic or pelagic, with the dominance of marls or calcareous marls in the Maastrichtian period while biogenic limestones compose the sedimentation during the Danian. The KTB is easily identified by the typical Iridium anomaly, well preserved in the section and located at the base of the dark clay layer (Bonte et al., 1984). The sedimentation rate is 4.3 cm/kyr for the Maastrichtian and is unknown for the Danian (Vonhof 1997).
The low MS interval described by Font et al. (2011) is located in the first 50 cm below the KTB and include an interval where color change from grey to red-yellow. The red color may be due to presence of pigmentary hematite, while the yellow color is interpreted to be due to presence of akaganeite (Torrent and Bardon, 2002).
For the present study, the Bidart section has been resampled by focusing on the low MS interval. More than 100 samples has been collected in the field, funded by a FCT project on Volcanism and Mass Extinctions (ref. PTDC/CTE-GIX/117298/2010), and provided by my supervisor Eric Font. Block samples were further cut into small plate-like samples in laboratory (Fig. 6).

2.1.2	Sopelana and Uruxa
Fig. 7 - Pictures of the Sopelana section (A) and the Uruxa section (B) during the field trip to Bilbao.
The analyzed sedimentary sections in the Basque Country (Sopelana and Uruxa) were formed in the Basque-Cantabric basin, the same as Bidart. Therefore, the characteristics of these sections are similar, with the presence of hemipelagic limestones above the KTB (Danian) and red/grey marls during the Maastrichtian. The Sopelana section is localized in the north coast of Bilbao, Spain. This section is affected by reverse and strike-slip faults in the late Cretaceous period, what may cause stratigraphic repetitions (Rodriguez-Tovar et al., 2011). The Uruxa section is located near the village of Gernika-Lumo, about 20-30 km East from Bilbao. This section is not very well studied. The KTB is well identified in both sections by the Iridium anomaly.
The number of collected samples was near 50 for each section (Sopelana and Uruxa) and the sampling interval varied from 2 cm to 20 cm.
2.2	Gubbio
KTB
L______W SJ
Fig. 8 - Gubbio section picture, showing the white limestones under the KTB.
The Gubbio section is located in the Umbria-Marche Apennines, north from the town Gubbio, central Italy. It is composed mainly by pink to red limestones and marly limestones that have been thoroughly bioturbated and compacted prior to cementation, except an interval 20-50 cm thick bellow the KTB, which is constituted by white bleached limestone. The KTB is well identified by the presence of the Iridium level (Cronholm et al., 2007). At the late Cretaceous and early Paleocene the Gubbio/Umbria-Marche basin had a depth between 1500 and 2500 m, according to agglutinated foraminifera. The sedimentary rate of the basin at late Creataceous was calculated to be 4 to 6 mm/yr, becoming lower in Paleocene, with 2-3 mm/yr.
Samples from the Gubbio section have been provided by Prof. Brooks B. Ellwood from the University of Florida (USA) and correspond to those studied in Ellwood et al. (2003). The number of samples is 100 and with a mean sampling interval of 5 cm.
The low MS interval at Gubbio is also featured by a characteristic changes in color from pink (with hematite) to white (Fig. 8). Such change in color has been interpreted by Lowrie et al. (1990) to correspond to secondary processes such as the percolation of reducing fluids, probably with origin on the organic matter resultant from the KT mass extinction. Akaganeite was found by Font et al. (2011) in the white levels.
2.3	Iran
The Galanderud section is located in the Alborz mountains about 25 km south of the Royan city and southwest of Noor province, Iran. Its sediments cover the upper part of the Cenomanian (Cretaceous) until the Miocene. The Maastrichtian sediments consist in gray to brown pelagic marls, interbedded with marly limestones. Marly sediments are rich in foraminifera, ostracods and other microfossils including echinoids and inoceramids. An estimative of the KTB position is a transition from brown to dark brown marls at the end of Maastrichtian and a sharp contact with clay and chalk layers at the base of the Danian. No detailed and high-resolution biostratigraphy has been performed near the KTB in this section. The number of samples is 53 and the sampling interval varies from 5 to 10 cm.

2.4	India
Fig. 10 - Geographic location of the studied indian sections (Dhapewada, Daiwal River, Anjar and Podgawan) and their stratigraphic positions (Images courtesy of Alicia Fantasia).
The studied Indian sections sediments (inter-trappean sediments) were deposited in lacustrine or estuarine environments, during phases of lower activity of the Deccan Traps volcanism. The sections are present at different stratigraphic positions, each related to a Deccan volcanism phase. The Daiwal River and Dhapewada sections were deposited during the phase-1, while the Anjar section concerns to the transition between the phase-1 and phase-2 (Fig. 10). The Podgawan section was exposed during the main Deccan phase, the phase-2, where the sediments exhibit the highest chemical alteration index values (Fantasia, 2013). The sediments consist mainly of massive or fissile clays, marls, siliceous to marly limestones and organic-rich rocks. The KTB remains to be determined.
3.	Methods
3.1	Sample preparation
In the laboratory, rock powder has been prepared by crushing rock fragments in an agate mortar and subsequently put into cubic plastic boxes of 8 cm3 in volume (Fig. 11), with special cares to avoid any contaminations. Mass is measured for each cube with a precision of 10-3 g. After this procedure, the samples are ready to be measured in the laboratory apparatus.

3.2	Magnetic Susceptibility
Magnetic susceptibility (MS) is a dimensionless quantity that reflects how easy a substance is magnetized when a magnetic field is applied. It is proportional to the concentration of ferromagnetic minerals, so that a sample with higher MS gets a higher magnetization when exposed to a certain magnetic field, as expressed by the equation (1), where J is the magnetization, X is the MS and H is the magnetic field.
J = !H	(1)
3.2.1	Mass specific Bulk Susceptibility
The MS was measured with a MFK1 Kappabridge (AGICO) apparatus in the laboratory. The field intensity was set to 200 A/m and the frequency was F1 (976 Hz). The measurements were made on bulk susceptibility mode, and the results are already referred to a constant volume, which is set to be 10 cm3 by the apparatus. As the cube boxes have a volume of 8 cm3, the results must be corrected using the equation (2). Kb is the bulk susceptibility, V0 is the nominal volume (the 10 cm3 used by the apparatus), V is the real volume of the sample and KT is the total susceptibility, the induced magnetic moment of the sample divided by the nominal volume. The final values presented during this dissertation are reported relative to mass specific m3/kg by dividing by density.

3.2.2	Frequent dependent susceptibility (Kfd)
Frequency-dependent susceptibility (Kfd) is a proxy used to evaluate the contribution of very fine (superparamagnetic) particles in a sample. The measurement is based on the fact that SP crystals lose their magnetization in a very short period of time, when the induced magnetic field is removed. A low frequency measurement allows the SP crystals behave as ferromagnetic mineral and contribute fully to the MS signal, whereas at high frequency the SP crystals are paramagnetic. So, it is expected that a sample without SP crystals have the same MS in the two frequencies, but a sample with SP crystals is expected to different MS values in function of the frequency. The Kfd is an index, expressed in percentage, calculated following the equation (3) proposed by Dearing (1994):
Lf -
Kfd =	x 100	(3)
!f
where Lf is the MS measured for low frequency and Hf is the MS for high frequency. A significant contribution of SP particles have Kfd &gt; 10% (Table 1).
For the present study, MS was measured using the MFK1 kappabridge at the frequencies F1 (976 Hz) and F3 (15616 Hz). The measurement has been repeated three times each for each sample. In order to reduce measurement errors, a simple mean of the three values was considered for each frequency.

&gt; 14.0	Rare values, erroneous measurement, anisotropy, weak sample or contamination
3.3	Isothermal Remanent Magnetization (IRM)
Isothermal Remanent Magnetization (IRM) is a magnetization acquired by a sample when submitted to an induced magnetic field, at constant temperature (usually the room's temperature). The magnetization depends on the magnetic mineralogy of the sample, as only the ferromagnetic mineral with coercivity less than the applied field are magnetized. The applied field intensity is gradually increased in the impulse magnetizer (IM-10-30) and the acquired magnetization measured at each step on a JR6 spinner magnetometer. Once plot on a graph H(mT) versus IRM(A/m), the IRM curve provide two important parameters: SIRM (magnetization saturation) and B1/2 (the field needed to induced half of the saturation; ~mean coercive force).
3.3.1	Cumulative Log-Gaussian Functions
Robertson and France (2004) showed that an IRM curve follow a normal Gaussian law and can be transformed into a Cumulative Log-Gaussian function (CLG). Later, Kruiver et al. (2001) developed a new method to analyse the IRM curves, based on the CLG function. The method consists in three curves fitting the IRM data versus the logarithm of the applied field: the first curve is the Linear Acquisition Plot (LAP), with the acquisition curve on a linear scale; the second is the Gradient Acquisition Plot (GAP), with the acquisition curve expressed as a gradient; and the third curve is the Standardised Acquisition Plot (SAP), with the acquisition curve on a probability scale. The IRM curve may be decomposed into a number of CLG curves, each curve referring to an individual ferromagnetic mineral (component) and characterized by three parameters: the saturation IRM (SIRM), B1/2 and dispersion parameter (DP). The total curve is the sum of all the individual curves (magnetic components).
In order to find the best fitting curve for the IRM data in the Kruiver et al. (2001) software, we need to identify the number of components and their values of SIRM, log B1/2 and DP by tentative to error. The advantage of the method is that, in addition to SIRM and B1/2 parameters, we obtain a third parameter, the DP parameter, that is the dispersion parameter, so lower values of DP reveal more homogeneous coercivity assemblages.

The S-ratio is a rock magnetic parameter that measures the relative contribution of low and high coercive minerals within a sample. Thompson et al. (1986) proposed the classical S-ratio formula, expressed in equation (4), where a is the IRM for a positive field of 0,3T (because magnetite grains should be saturated by fields of 300 mT) and b is the IRM for a positive strong field of 1 T (most of the cases, it can be considered SIRM). The values of the classic S-ratio vary from -1 (high coercive minerals) to 1 (low coercive minerals). Analyzing the extreme cases, if the S-ratio is 1, a is equal to b, so the magnetization at a 0,3 and 1T of the sample is the same. It means that the sample is completely saturated at 300 mT, indicating it is constituted by low coercive minerals. On the contrary, if the S-ratio is -1, the sample has only acquired magnetization for fields stronger than 0,3 T, meaning that the sample is constituted by high coercive minerals.
Bloemendal et al. (1992) redefined the S-ratio (called S'-ratio) as the ratio of the IRM for a positive field at 300 mT by the IRM for a positive field at 1 T (5). In this case, the S-ratio varies from 0, when the sample has no magnetization after being exposed to a 300 mT field (high coercive minerals), to 1, when the magnetization is the same for a 300 mT and a 1 T field (low coercive minerals). Kruiver et al. (2001) considered the Bloemendal S-ratio definition more logical, so in this work all the S-ratio were calculated on this form.
3.1	Thermomagnetic curves
Thermomagnetic curves are used to identify the ferromagnetic minerals present in a sample through its Curie temperature (the temperature at which a ferromagnetic mineral loses its magnetic properties and turns paramagnetic). The Curie temperature (Tc) of several minerals is well tabulated, so its determination on a thermomagnetic curve may help us identifying the ferromagnetic minerals. The thermomagnetic curves are done at high (HT) and low temperatures (LT). The HT curves consists in measuring the magnetic susceptibility while the sample is being warmed until 700°C and then while it is cooling until reaches the room temperature again. The measures are performed on a CS4 furnace in an Argon controlled atmosphere, to avoid sample's oxidation during warming phase. For LT measurements samples are cooled to -192°C using liquid nitrogen on a CS-L cryostat apparatus. The magnetic susceptibility is measured while the sample is warming up until it reaches the room's temperature again. The MS is measured with a MFK1 Kappabridge (AGICO) and the data is treated by Cureval 8.0 (AGICO) software.
3.2	Diffuse Reflectance Spectrophotometry (DRS)
The color of the rock is essentially controlled by their mineralogy and notably by the composition of the iron oxides present in the sediment. For example, small amount of pigmentary hematite are needed to give a red color to a sediment. Therefore, coupling color data to magnetic properties is a new approach to characterize the magnetic mineralogy of a sample (Ellwood et al, 2003).
Diffuse Reflectance Spectrophotometry, also called color, is a rapid and non-destructive technique based on the reflection spectrum of the sample. The samples need to be carefully prepared, smashed until they are transformed into a very fine powder and then packed into a sample holder with a circular hole to form a smooth surface without irregularities (Fig. 12). A beam of incident light is pointed to the prepared sample and diffuse reflectance spectrum data from 390 to 700 nm (with intervals of 10 nm) is stored in a convenient file format on the computer. The spectrum data can be converted into a color by using the Munsell color system, a three dimensional coordinates (L* a* b*) following the Comission International de l’Eclairage (CIE, 1976). The L* axis represents “lightness-darkness”, the a* axis “redness-greeness” and the b* axis “yellowness-blueness”. Each iron oxide exhibits a color that is mainly a function of the electron transitions allowed by its structure, so that the spectrum data may help identifying the iron oxides present in our samples. Furthermore, in this work is used the CIE values and how it varies over a sedimentary section, in order to evaluate if there is a relation between the color and the magnetic properties. The data were obtained using a X-Rite Colortron spectrophotometer from 86 rock powders, in order to avoid grain size effects. All the samples were measured three times and the mean value was considered.
3.2.1	The first derivative of reflectance spectra
The first derivative of the reflectance data may be used to identify iron oxides in sediments. Previous studies have shown that two common iron oxides, hematite and goethite have distinct first derivative peaks, centered at 565 and 435 nm, respectively (Deaton and Balsam, 1991). The first derivative was calculated and represented with a MATLAB program. The program read the notepad files with the spectrum data and automatically calculates and represents the graphs of the first derivative of all samples present in the file at one time. A finite differences method should be enough to have a good approximation on the first derivative curve, but I decided to program a five-point method (Equation 5), which is more accurate. R is the reflectance, X is the wave length (nm) and h is the spacing interval (in nm).

The high-resolution magnetic study at Bidart (Fig. 13) confirmed the low MS interval described by Font et al. (2011). This low MS interval is right below the KTB and is accompanied by a notable decrease in S-ratio from values next to 1 to values next to 0, indicative of the dominance of a highly coercive component, which is probably akaganeite (referred as component 2). The component 1 is of a low to medium coercivity and probably corresponds to detrital magnetite observed under SEM microscope (Font et al., 2011).
In addition to the previous results of Font et al. (2011) we show here that the low MS interval actually corresponds to a loss in detrital magnetite (component 1) as shown by the strong decrease in SIRM/mass values (Fig. 13). The Log B 1/2 profile also detects the presence of the component 2 with a high coercivity in the low MS interval.
The IRM acquisition curves were separated by intervals in Fig. 13. In the Dark clay layer interval, above the KTB, the IRM curve is magnetite type, with the samples being totally saturated at low magnetic fields (less than 300 mT). At the top of the low MS interval, the curves are still highly magnetized at low fields, but some of them start to don’t reach the saturation, suggesting a mixture of magnetite and the high coercive mineral (akaganeite). In the middle of the low MS interval, the samples are very resistant to magnetization, indicative of a high coercive phase. In the base of low MS interval the high coercive phase gradually disappears, giving place to a magnetite typical curve in the Maastrichtian marls again.

Fig. 14 - CLG treatment of two samples from Bidart, one in the low MS interval to emphasize the coercive mineral and other in the Maastrichtian Marls.
In the Fig. 14 two examples of CLG treatment (Kruiver et al., 2001), one in the low MS interval (PKB2B2) and the second in the Maastrichtian marls (PK8A2), are shown. The high coercive phase is visible in the sample PKB2B2, as the LAP is far from saturation and in GAP a phase with a Log Bi/2 with values near 2.5 is well identified. The magnetite phase is also identified in this sample (Log B1/2 around 1.5), but in a very minor contribution. The sample PK8A2 is already saturated at lower magnetic fields as shown in LAP and the GAP evidence the presence of two low coercivity phases, with Log B1/2 values less than 2.
The high coercive phase detected in the CLG treatment is explained by the presence of akaganeite as it is an anti-ferromagnetic mineral. This type of ferromagnetic minerals have anti-parallel spins and creates a strong autodemagnetizing internal field, so that a very strong field is necessary to orientate the spins to the same direction.
4.1.2	Basque Country
The Basque Country studied sections don’t show conclusive results (Fig. 15). The MS in Sopelana is quite constant along the profile, with exception for a high peak near 120 cm. In the DRS data there is nothing to enhance. The Uruxa section results don’t add much to the discussion as well. Just as Sopelana, there is no evidence of a low MS interval under the KTB. The DRS data evidence a color transition about 20 cm under the KTB, tending to a “redness” pattern.

Fig. 17 - Comparison between IRM normalized curves from Gubbio at different intervals.
The Fig. 16 describes the magnetic data from the Gubbio (Italy) section. It is observed an abrupt change on magnetic properties in the KTB. A low MS interval is found bellow this limit and it is followed by a general decrease in the SIRM of all components. A third coarser component appears in this interval, and the relative contribution of the components change, with the component 2 becoming the major contributor. The S-ratio also starts to decrease bellow the KTB, reflecting the presence of a greater amount of higher coercivity phases. IRM curves (Fig. 17) agree with the presence of a coarser mineral in all section, but in higher concentration in the low MS interval or below, as they don’t reach saturation at lower fields. At least one of the coarser mineral detected in IRM is hematite, as the thermomagnetic curves show a Tc near 680°C (Fig. 18).
According to DRS data, in the low MS interval the samples present a less “redness” and “yellowness” color, and also a less “darkness”. This agrees with the log description of the sedimentary section, which shows that this low MS interval is constituted by white limestone. The reflectance spectra’s first derivative graphics show two distinct peaks in most of the samples, as illustrated in Fig. 19. These peaks are positioned precisely in the typical wavelengths for Goethite and Hematite (Deaton and Balsam, 1991). However, goethite is not identified in the thermomagnetic curves (Tc=120°C). Torrent and Barron (2002) pointed that this method may fail to identify akaganeite and other iron oxides because of similar colors and high color variability, what can explain the difficulty using the method.

4.1.4	Iran
The DRS data from Iran don't show significant trends in the L*, a* and b* curves, except at the chalk levels where an abrupt shifts in the color are observed (Fig. 20). The abrupt shift in the MS value at 140 m is interpreted to correspond to the KTB as it was already observed in other sections worldwide. Note that the exact position of the KTB in the Galanderud section was not yet defined before our study. Our magnetic results provide for the first time the position of the KTB in Iran and well corroborate recent biostratigraphic data (Asgharianrostami et al., 2013). If we assume a correct position for the KTB we do not observe here the typical low MS interval such as in Bidart and Gubbio. The explanation would be that the section is not complete stratigraphicaly or simply because it does not exist in this part of the globe.

4.2	Discussion
The Bidart magnetic high-resolution study confirmed the results of Font et al., (2011). The low MS interval is positioned immediately under the KTB and IRM analysis confirmed the presence of the high coercive mineral akaganeite. Its presence was also confirmed by SEM (Fig. 5) and is accompanied by a magnetite loss. These new data are now published in Font et al. (2013). Font et al. (2013) proposed a model for the formation of akaganeite in volcanic events, and for its transport through the stratosphere in order to explain the presence of akaganeite thousands of kilometers away from the Deccan province at the time of the eruptions.
The model of akaganeite formation and transport (Fig. 21) starts with the convection generated by the strong heating due to the widespread lava flows. According to Kaminski et al. (2011) this heating is enough to create a buoyancy force capable of transporting the volcanic plume to the high atmosphere and even stratosphere. When the volcanic plume, rich in FeCl2, reaches the high atmosphere, a reaction with water and oxygen occurs to form akaganeite. The volcanic aerosols and akaganeite are then transported through the stratosphere, where it can circle the globe in two weeks (Robock, 2000). Therefore, it is possible that the akaganeite could be deposited thousands of kilometers away from Deccan.
The model also explains the loss in detrital magnetite as we demonstrated here by the abrupt decrease of SIRM values (Fig. 13). The hypothesis is based on the effect of acid rains as a consequence of the huge Deccan volcanic gas emissions. The normal rain has a pH of 5.6, but the volcanic rains may have a pH of 3 to 4.5 (Calabrese et al, 2011). As the magnetite can be totally dissolved with a pH&lt;4 (White et al., 1994), the volcanic origin acid rains explains the magnetite loss.

The Gubbio section also presents a low MS interval, although it is not as clear as in Bidart. The presence of akaganeite was confirmed by SEM observations (Fig. 5), but contrary to Bidart its identification by using IRM analyses is more complicated. This is because in Bidart there is no dominance of hematite in the Maastrichtian marls, whereas in Italy it is the main magnetic carrier. Note that hematite and akaganeite are both antiferromagnetic and thus cannot be discriminated by their coercivity on IRM curves. However, in Gubbio, one to two high coercive component is observed in the profile, even in the low MS interval composed by white limestones. However, as few pigment of hematite are needed to give a red color to a sediment, it means that the high coercive phase identified in the low MS interval of Gubbio cannot be hematite. By elimination we suggest that this high coercive phase correspond to the akaganeite identified under SEM by Font et al. (2011).
Lowrie et al. (1990) interpreted this change in color due to reducing conditions (that transform FeIII into FeII) during post-depositional processes, such as the percolation of reducing fluids due to high levels of organic matter probably originated from the KT mass extinction. However, the white beds are 50 cm thick and it is very difficult for fluids to penetrate limestones downward. Secondly, if reducing conditions were prevalent there we should only form reduced iron and thus magnetite. But this is not the case, since antiferromagnetic phase is still present in this interval. We thus conclude that akaganeite probably correspond to the high coercive phase identified in the low MS interval and that the acid rain model proposed by Font et al. (2013) at Bidart may also be applicable to the Gubbio
section. The identified hematite in the thermomagnetic curves in the white limestones interval may be a product of akaganeite transformation during the heating of the sample. Yue et al. (2011) affirms the akaganeite can be converted to hematite when exposed to higher temperatures than 300°C.
The other KT sections (Iran and Basque Country) don’t add much to the discussion. The low MS interval is not present. These results are probably due to the tectonic deformation and/or chemical alteration.

The magnetic and DRS data of Anjar (Fig. 22) don’t show much variety through the sedimentary column. The MS profile follows the facie changes, with lower values in limestone samples and higher values in clay/marl samples. The IRM analysis identified two components. The first component is probably magnetite, with a low coercivity (Log B1/2 close to 1.6). The second component has a high coercivity (Log B1/2 close to 2.5) but its contribution is low (between 15-20%), and it is probably hematite, as the thermomagnetic curve of the sample ANJ-27 (at the distance 349 cm in the log) shows a Tc=680°C (Fig. 23). The IRM curves and coercivity parameters don’t change considerably through the profile, so we may conclude that similar magnetic mineralogy is shared by all the samples. The Kfd values are almost constant through the profile, indicating a mixture of SP grains and coarser non-SP grains (2&lt;Kfd&lt;10, Table 1).

In the Dhapewada magnetic data (Fig. 24) stands the sample Dhap-10 and the Dhap-15, at the distance of 85 and 132 cm, respectively. Both samples (with emphasis to Dhap-10) present a peak of higher MS in comparison with the nearest samples and the two mineralogic components have low coercivity values (Log B1/2 less than 1.5 in both components). By the contrary, the other samples have a component 2 with higher coercivity (Log B1/2 higher than 2). The thermomagnetic curve (Fig. 23) of Dhap-10 shows the presence of two minerals, which are magnetite (Tc=580°C) and probably maghemite. Maghemite has a Tc=645°C (Dunlop and Ozdemir, 1997), but is thermally unstable and can be destroyed at temperatures higher than 300°C. In the cooling curve, the transition between 300350°C observed in the heating curve isn’t present, so we assume the maghemite was destroyed. Also note that maghemite has low coercivity values, what agrees with the IRM data. The magnetite could be a product of the maghemite transformation in the heating process, but in this case it is an original mineral because it had been identified in the IRM curves.
The Fig. 25 compares the IRM curves and CLG treatment of Dhap-10 and Dhap-16. In the LAP curves it is visible that Dhap-10 saturates at lower fields what corroborates the two very low coercivity phases identified in the GAP curve. On the other side, Dhap-16 has a second component with a higher coercivity, with a low contribution, but sufficient to do not saturate in the applied fields.
The DRS data doesn’t show much variation through the section. The sample Dhap-10, which has the highest MS value, presents a more “redness” and dark color. The Kfd values follow the MS profile, but only the samples 3, 4 and 10 may have a small quantity of SP grains (Kfd&lt;2).

Concerning the Daiwal River section, it is noted that a third component with very high coercivity is present in some samples. However, its concentration is low, with exception of a particular sample, the DA-3. This sample is from a sediment deposition in a basalt fissure, and has the highest MS in the profile. But the major particularity is that the contribution of the component 3 is higher than the other components. It is reflected on the S-ratio value, with a notable decrease to values below 0.5. The Fig. 27 shows the IRM and CLG treatment for this sample, where it is evident the presence of a very high coercivity phase, resulting in an IRM curve far from saturation.
The MS profile doesn't show abrupt variations through the section, with the values becoming higher as they approach the basalts. The DRS data is almost constant along the profile, with exception to the basalt samples, which present a darker pattern as expected. The samples don't have SP grains (Kfd&lt;2) or have a mixture of SP and non-SP grains (2&lt;Kfd&lt;10).

Fig. 28 - Magnetic and DRS data of the inter-trappean sediments in Podgawan, India.
The Podgawan section results show a very distinct magnetic mineralogy in comparison with the other sections. The IRM analysis (with the help of CLG functions) identified at least three mineralogic components, reaching four and even five components in some samples. Their coercivity is not very high, as few components identified in this section surpasses a log B1/2 of 2.5, and the highest coercivity minerals have a very low content. Therefore, the S-ratio values are always very high, near 1. The Fig. 29 presents the CLG treatment to three different samples along the section. POA-14 (coal level) can be adjusted considering three components, but POB-3 and POB-9 still needs more components to achieve a good adjustment. The components are probably different phases of magnetite, with a very large distribution of grain sizes (heterogeneous distribution). The thermomagnetic curve of POA-14 shows a magnetite composition, but the POB-9 and POA-16 (red clay) identifies some hematite, along with the magnetite.
The MS profile follows the facie changes (higher values on clays and lower on limestones), except a peak of high MS on a red clay level, accompanied by higher SIRM values. It is precisely in this level that the sediments are constituted by SP grains (Kfd&gt;10), what is indicative of alteration. About the DRS data, it shows some abrupt changes in color through the profile.

5.2	Discussion
The results obtained from the magnetic analysis at the Podgawan section were by far the most interesting. The Podgawan sediments were deposited during the phase-2 of the Deccan volcanism, characterized by stressful environmental conditions and a global warming due to the great amount of CO2 input in the atmosphere and acid rains. In fact, our results in Podgawan show an unusual number of low to medium magnetic components, which we interpret as various populations of magnetite (identified through their Curie temperature, Fig. 23) with various amount of Titanium and a large distribution of grain size. We suggest that such heterogeneity result from severe weathering and stressed paleo-environmental conditions during the Deccan phase-2. Ghosh et al. (2006) and Srivastava et al. (2012) analyzed the inter-basaltic bole beds in the Deccan LIP and confirmed that weathering processes were intense during the Deccan volcanism.
Alicia Fantasia (2013) performed a great variety of geological and geochemical measurements in the same samples and provided similar results. Very negative values of S13C are indicative of the high concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, which was unequivocally due to volcanic input (Fig. 30).
Also they evaluated the chemical index of alteration (CIA) of the samples and noted that the Podgawan section had the highest values of CIA (Fig. 31). We thus propose that the number of components is proportional to the deterioration degree of the sample and is indicative of the severe paleoclimatic conditions during its deposition.
Another important result from the Podgawan section concerns samples POA-14 (coal level) and POA-16 (red clay), separated by just 13 cm. The POA-14 is composed mostly by magnetite. Although a coarser component (hematite/goethite?) is observed in the IRM curve, its contribution is very low and not depicted in the thermomagnetic curve (Fig. 23). However, the POA-16 presents completely different characteristics: the color (red) and the composition (hematite, identified both in IRM and thermomagnetic curve). Considering their proximity in the sedimentary column, an abrupt change in environmental conditions must had occurred. The Chicxulub impact is supposed to generate a thermal radiation capable of burning forests all around the globe (Belcher et al., 2003). The burned material that resulted from this phenomena may be the origin of the coal level present in POA-14. Subsequently, the posterior deposition would occur in an arid environment, more favourable to oxidation, what explains the red color, and the presence of hematite in POA-16. Presence of organic matter in POA-14 should have created reducing conditions, where only magnetite and iron sulphur remain stable, giving an explanation for the dominance of magnetite in our magnetic data. On the other hand, hematite is only formed via oxidation of iron precursors and thus its dominance in sample POA-16 suggest arid and oxidizing conditions. In Fig. 32 we can detect the hematite (Fe and O peaks in the spectrum) in the form of small spherules, which we interpret as the result of the matrix oxidation. This may be due to the absence of the vegetal cover after the wildfire that favours contact with oxygen and transforms magnetite to hematite.
This hypothesis has important implication for the problematic of the KT mass extinction, because we may be able now to locate precisely the position (age) of the meteorite impact and of the Deccan Phase-2 and their link with the mass extinction. Keller et al. (2009) positioned the KTB (and the mass extinction) in the Jhilmili inter-trappean sediments, using biostratigraphy analysis. Figure 33 shows that the Jhilmili sediments were deposited at the end of the Deccan Phase 2, just after the Podgawan sediments. Since the impact is marked on the Podgawan section by the coal level, we suggest that the mass extinction occurred after the impact, as Keller et al. (2003) had already defended.

6.	Conclusions
The main conclusions of this work are:
•	Gubbio has similar results to Bidart: i) the low MS interval is present and corresponds to the loss of detrital magnetite and hematite, explaining the disappearance of the red color in this interval. ii) the presence of another very coercive phase that does not correspond to hematite and we interpret as being the akaganeite previously described in literature.
•	Data from Sopelana and Uruxa was not conclusive, probably due to strong deformation that affected the area after Cretaceous.
•	In Iran, an abrupt transition in MS data was identified and is interpreted as the KTB according to published biostratigraphy data.
•	The Podgawan magnetic data supports the evidence of very high weathering during the phase-2 of Deccan volcanism, due to the presence of several (4 to 5) magnetic components.
•	In addition, a peculiar interval of black (organic matter) and red (hematite) thin sedimentary levels is interpreted as the result of wildfire due to the Chicxulub impact. These data demonstrate for the first time that the Chixculub impact occurred during Deccan phase 2. Moreover, considering that the KTB has been found at the Jhilmili sediments and the Podgawan section is older in age, it's possible that the impact occurred before the KTB.
•	These results provide new insight to check for the contribution of Deccan volcanism and Chicxulub impact in the KT mass extinction.
