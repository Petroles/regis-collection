RESUMO 
 

SANTOS, Udson, M.Sc., Universidade Federal de Viçosa, fevereiro de 2010. 
Filogeografia citogenética e molecular em populações de traíras 
Hoplias malabaricus (Bloch, 1794), do leste do Brasil. Orientador: 
Jorge Abdala Dergam dos Santos. Co-Orientadores: Karla Suemy 
Clemente Yotoko e Rubens Pazza. 
 

 A fauna de peixes dulcícolas neotropicais é considerada a mais rica 

do mundo. Toda essa diversidade é resultante da complexa história 

paleohidrológica dos rios sul e centro-americanos, a qual promoveu 

vicariancia e dispersão da biota aquática ao longo de milhões de anos. A 

traíra Hoplias malabaricus é um caracídeo com ampla distribuição 

neotropical, habito sedentário e comportamento predatório. Graças à sua 

rusticidade e abundância nos neotrópicos, a traíra é amplamente estudada, 

representando um importante modelo biológico experimental. As populações 

de H. malabaricus são caracterizadas por apresentarem sete distintos 

cariomorfos, listados de A-G. A distribuição simpátrica e alopátrica desses 

cariomorfos tem sido considerada como evidência da existência de múltiplas 

linhagens que comportam-se como boas espécies, dentro do mesmo táxon 

nominal. Para testar essa hipótese, foram analizados os padrões 

biogeográficos, citogenéticos e moleculares (DNA mitocondrial) de 17 

populações (73 espécimes) coletadas em 12 bacias do nordeste e sudeste 

do Brasil. Os padrões citogenéticos indicaram a existência de um sistema de 

cromossomos sexuais XX/XY no cariomorfo 2n=40F. Os dados moleculares 

indicaram ausência de fluxo gênico entre cariomorfos com 2n=40 e 2n=42 e 

constituem a primeira evidência da origem costeira das populações do rio 

Jacaré. A aparente ausência de uma taxa de evolução molecular constante 

não permitiu correlacionar eventos geomorfológicos de dispersão no 

passado e foi interpretada como resultante das extremas flutuações 

demográficas ao longo da evolução desse complexo de espécies. Os 

resultados apresentados indicam que a identificação cariotípica representa 

informação relevante e imprescindível para a inclusão dos dados 

experimentais num contexto filogenético.

ABSTRACT 
 
SANTOS, Udson, M.Sc., Universidade Federal de Viçosa, February, 2010. 
Molecular and karyotypic phylogeography in populations of the traíras 
Hoplias malabaricus (Bloch, 1794), in Eastern Brazil. Adviser: Jorge 
Abdala Dergam. Co-advisers: Karla Suemy Clemente Yotoko and Rubens 
Pazza. 

 

The Neotropical freshwater fish fauna is considered the richest of the 

world. This diversity is the direct result of the complex palaeohydrological 

history of the Central and South-American rivers, a process that promoted 

vicariance and dispersion of the aquatic biota along millions of years. The 

common trahira H. malabaricus is a widespread, sedentary predatory 

Neotropical characin. Due to its abundance and tolerance to transportation 

and laboratory conditions, the trahira has become a relevant model organism 

for experimental biology. H. malabaricus populations are characterized by 7 

karyomorphs named A-G. The allopatric and sympatric distribution of these 

karyomorphs has been considered as evidence for the existence of multiple 

lineages that behave as good species within this nominal taxon. To test this 

hypothesis, biogeographic, cytogenetic and molecular (mitochondrial DNA) 

patterns were analyzed in 17 populations (73 specimens) from 12 basins in 

northeasten and southeastern Brazil. Cytogenetic patterns indicated a XX/XY 

chromosome system in karyomorph 2n=40F. Molecular data indicated 

absence of gene flow among karyomorphs 2n=40 and 2n=42 and provided 

the first evidence of a coastal origin of the 2n=42 karyomorphs in the Jacaré 

River. The absence of a constant molecular rate of substitution hampered a 

correlation of past dispersal events and it was interepreted as an effect of 

extreme demographic fluctuations in this species complex. These results 

indicate that karyotypic identification is relevant and necessary for placing all 

experimental data in a phylogenetic context.

2. INTRODUCTION 

 
The Neotropical region harbours 6025 species of freshwater fishes 

(Reis et al., 2003), but perhaps as many as 8000 (Schaefer, 1998), the result 

of a long evolutionary history of isolation and specialization, involving mainly 

Otophysan fishes. Freshwater fishes are highly suitable for the recovery of 

past biogeographic processes, due to their obligatory relationship with water 

(Myers, 1938). The biogeographical information relevant for fish 

diversification has been reviewed by Lundberg et al. (1998) and Ribeiro 

(2006). The former revision focused on the evolution of Andean 

geomorphology and the effects of this process on the South American 

continent, whereas the latter work dealt with the evolution of particular 

coastal drainages, their geomorphological interactions with continental basins 

and the expected levels of phylogenetic divergence among fishes derived 

during this complex temporal scenario. 

 

Among Neotropical freshwater fishes, the trahira, Hoplias malabaricus 

(Bloch, 1794), has one of the largest distributional ranges, occurring from 

Panamá to the Buenos Aires Province in Argentina (Berra, 2007). Hoplias 

malabaricus is well adapted to life in small, isolated populations, in conditions 

that may facilitate the stochastic fixation of chromosomal rearrangements 

(Sites &amp;amp; Moritz, 1987). This species is one of the cytogenetically most studied 

taxa and shows a conspicuous karyotypic diversification, with up to seven 

karyomorphs with diploid numbers ranging from 39 to 42. Three groups of 

karyomorphs are readily evident, based on distribution ranges. Two 

karyomorphs, 2n=42A and 2n=40C, are the most widespread and occur in 

sympatry in the Lower Paraná-Paraguay and Amazon basins. A second, less 

widely spread group is represented by three karyomorphs: 

• 2n=40F occurs in the São Francisco Basin, in the lower portions of the 

Tocantins River, in coastal drainages in Suriname, and in minor basins in 

north-eastern Brazil; 

• 2n=39/40D occurs in the Upper Paraná (in sympatry with 2n=42A) and; 



 5

• 2n=40/41G occurs exclusively in the Amazonian Basin in the Aripuanã, 

Madeira and Trombetas rivers. 

The third group consists of karyomorphs with much restricted distributions. 

For example, 2n=42B occurs in the Doce Basin (also in sympatry with 

2n=42A), and 2n=42E occurs only in the Trombetas River, as indicated by 

surveys conducted so far (Bertollo et al., 2000). 

 

The lack of hybrids between sympatric karyomorphs has been 

interpreted as evidence for the existence of several distinct species within 

this nominal taxon (Bertollo et al., 1986; Bertollo et al., 2000). Therefore, 

uniparental molecular markers can be a particularly useful complement to 

assess gene flow in wild populations. To date, molecular studies on H. 

malabaricus have been restricted to populations in the Doce Basin (Dergam 

et al., 2002) and the Iguaçu Basin (Dergam et al., 1998). Both studies 

indicated phylogenetically related populations in the coastal and continental 

basins, but failed to reveal the direction of dispersal events. 

 

Karyotypic and molecular patterns of variation may reveal vicariances 

and dispersals that provide insights into evolutionary processes that may 

involve other components of the aquatic fauna. The congruence of 

independent molecular and cytogenetic characters may give support to the 

hypothesis that at least some karyomorphs behave as valid species within H. 

malabaricus. A better understanding of H. malabaricus species-level 

systematics is needed to correctly interpret the comparative physiological, 

behavioural and anatomical studies in an explicit phylogenetic framework 

(Harvey &amp;amp; Pagel, 1991). Biodiversity patterns in this species complex also 

bear potential information to understand the palaeohydrology of the 

continent. In the present study, patterns of cytogenetic and molecular 

variation of H. malabaricus populations in the São Francisco, Grande and in 

several coastal basins along Eastern Brazil were analyzed using molecular 

and cytogenetic techniques. 

 

3. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 



 6

3.1 SPECIMENS AND CHROMOSOME PREPARATION 

 

Cytogenetic analyses were carried out on 49 specimens collected in 

the Pandeiros River, Pará River and its headwaters in the Tombadouro 

Creek and in the Jacaré River. (Table I, Fig. 1). Cell division was stimulated 

in vivo with two daily applications of Munolan®, a commercially available 

antigen lysate, following Molina (2001). Mitotic chromosomes were obtained 

from cell suspensions of the anterior kidney, using the conventional air-drying 

method (Bertollo et al., 1978). Fish were previously anesthetized with clove 

oil according to Henyey et al. (2002). Secondary data from 10 populations 

with known chromosome numbers were also included in the analysis. 

 

3.2 CHROMOSOME STAINING 

 

In addition to the standard Giemsa method, chromosomes were 

analyzed using silver nitrate staining (Howell &amp;amp; Black, 1980) to visualize the 

nucleolar organizing regions (Ag-NORs). C banding was also employed to 

detect C-positive heterochromatin (Sumner, 1972). DAPI and Chromomycin 

A3 (CMA3) fluorescence staining were used to identify the chromosome AT 

and GC rich regions, respectively (Sola et al., 1992). Some populations with 

unknown karyotypes (or whose karyotypes are being studied by JAD) were 

also included in this study (see below). 

 

3.3 CHROMOSOME HYBRIDIZATION AND KARYOTYPIC ANALYSIS 

 

Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed according to 

Pinkel et al. (1986) using three repetitive DNA sequences probes isolated 

from the genome of H. malabaricus. The first probe contained a 5S rDNA 

repeat copy and included 120 base pairs (bp) of the 5S rRNA encoding gene 

and 200 bp of the non-transcribed spacer (NTS) (Martins et al., 2006). The 

second probe is specific to H. malabaricus (Ferreira et al., 2007) and 

contained a copy of the repetitive satellite 5SHindIII-DNA sequence with 360 

bp composed of a 95-bp segment similar to the 5S rRNA gene of the first

and a 265-bp segment similar to the NTS of the first probe (Martins et al., 

2006). The third probe corresponded to a 1400 bp-segment of the 18S rRNA 

gene obtained by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from nuclear DNA 

(Cioffi et al., 2009). The probes were labelled by nick-translation with biotin-

14-dATP (Bionick Labeling System-Invitrogen). Signal detection and its 

amplification were performed using conjugated avidin-FITC and anti-avidin-

biotin (Sigma). The chromosomes were counterstained with propidium iodide 

(50 ?g mL-1136) and analyzed with an Olympus BX50 epifluorescence 

microscope. The chromosomal images were captured using CoolSNAP-Pro 

software (Media Cybernetics). About 30 metaphase spreads were analyzed 

per specimen to determine the diploid chromosome number and karyotypic 

structure. Chromosomes were classified as metacentrics (m) or 

submetacentrics (sm), according to centromeric index values proposed by 

Levan et al. (1964). 

 

3.4 DNA EXTRACTION AND MOLECULAR ANALYSIS 

 

DNA extraction followed Boyce et al. (1989). Fragments of ATPase 6 

were amplified using primers L8524 (5’-AAY CCT GAR ACT GAC CAT G- 3’) 

and H9236 (5’-GTT AGT GGT CAK GGG CTT GGR TC- 3’) (Quenouille et 

al., 2004). Double stranded DNA was synthesized in 50 ?L reactions 

containing 10 ?L dNTPs (1 mM), 5 ?L reaction buffer (200 mM Tris-HCl pH 

8·4, 500 148 mM KCl), 2 ?L MgCl2 (50 mM), 2 ?L of each primer (10 mM), 

0·5 ?L (2·5 U) of Taq DNA polymerase ( Phoneutria ), 2 ?L of template DNA 

(100 ng/?L) and 26·5 ?L of H2O. PCR conditions were as follows: 94° C (2 

min), 5 cycles of 94° C (45 s), 54° C (45 s), 72° C (1.5 min), 29 cycles of 94° 

C (45 s), 58° C (45 s), 72° C (1·5 min). PCR products were purified using 

Qiaquick (Qiagen): 5 ?L of the purified PCR product were used in a 10 ?L 

cycle sequencing reaction using a dRhodamine terminator cycle sequencing 

kit (PE Applied Biosystems). Sequences were aligned using CLUSTAL W 

1.83 in MEGA 4.0 (Tamura et al., 2007). Phylogenetic trees were constructed 

with neighbour joining (NJ) (Saitou &amp;amp; Nei, 1987), maximum parsimony (MP), 

maximum likelihood (ML) (Felsenstein, 1981) and Bayesian inference (MB) 

(Huelsenbeck &amp;amp; Ronquist, 2001). The model of molecular evolution that best 



 10

fitted the data was chosen using Modeltest 3.7 (Posada &amp;amp; Crandall, 1998), 

and haplotype divergence was estimated within and between haplogroups 

using this selected model. Phylogenetic signal in NJ, MP and ML trees was 

assessed using bootstraps with 1000 repetitions. Bayesian inference was 

performed with 5 million MCMC steps to produce posterior probabilities of 

nodes in the tree with Mr Bayes. Hoplias lacerdae Miranda Ribeiro, 1908 was 

used as an outgroup. Sequences were deposited in GenBank (accession 

numbers GQ848606–GQ848642). 

 

4. RESULTS 
 

4.1 KARYOTYPIC DATA 

 

Karyomorph 2n=40F 

All specimens from the Pandeiros and Pará rivers (except those from 

Pará’s headwaters, in Tombadouro Creek) had 2n=40 chromosomes for both 

sexes. The karyotypes were composed of 10 m + 10 sm pairs, without 

morphologically differentiated sex chromosomes using Giemsa conventional 

staining (Fig. 2a), and were typical 2n=40F karyomorphs. C-banding showed 

heterochromatic blocks in centromeric regions, except for chromosome pairs 

Nos. 9 and 10, which had less conspicuous blocks, in addition to faint 

telomeric marks in some chromosome pairs. Males always showed an 

interstitial heterochromatic block in the short arms of one homologue of the 

first chromosome pair (Fig. 2c), whereas females lacked this block (Fig. 2e). 

This heterochromatic region was negative for DAPI staining but failed to 

show fluorescence with CMA3. A proximal heterochromatic block located on 

the short arms of a small submetacentric pair was the only observed GC-rich 

segment in both populations (Fig. 3f, i). Ag-NORs were telomeric, and their 

numbers were either fixed (four in the Pará River) or varied from 4 to 5 

(Pandeiros River) (Fig. 4a, b). FISH analyses with the repetitive sequences 

showed no differences between these two populations. The 18S rDNA probe 

hybridized on the pericentromeric region of one metacentric pair and on the 

telomeric regions of two submetacentric pairs (Fig. 3a). The 5S rDNA probe 

hybridized on the pericentromeric region of a medium-sized metacentric pair 



 11

(Fig. 3c). The repetitive 5SHindIII-DNA was mapped in the centromeric 

region of 10 chromosome pairs (Fig. 5a). Although Ibimirim samples were not 

karyotyped, they were collected in a region with populations characterized by 

2n=40F karyomorph and were assumed to share this karyomorph. 

 

Karyomorph 2n=42A 

In the headwaters of Tombadouro Creek, all specimens had 2n=42 

chromosomes, with a karyotype consisting of 11 m + 10 sm pairs, without 

morphologically differentiated sex chromosomes (Fig. 2b), and were 

considered to be typical 2n=42A karyomorphs. Besides some telomeric 

marks, conspicuous heterochromatic bands were found in the centromeric 

region of all chromosomes, except for chromosome pairs No. 6, 19 and 20, 

which showed faint blocks (Fig. 2d). Ag-NORs varied among and within 

individuals (1–2 pairs), and bitelomeric NORs were evident in either 1 or 2 

chromosomes (Fig. 4c). In this population, the 18S rDNA probe hybridized on 

three chromosome pairs, with interstitial, telomeric and bi-telomeric sites (Fig. 

3b). The 5S rDNA probe hybridized on the interstitial region of a large 

submetacentric pair (Fig. 3d). The repetitive 5SHindIII-DNA probe bound to 

the centromeric region of nine chromosome pairs (Fig. 5b). 

 

Specimens from the Jacaré River in the Grande drainage, had 2n=42 

karyomorphs composed of 11 m + 10 sm pairs, without morphologically 

differentiated sex chromosomes (Fig. 2b) and represented a typical 2n=42A 

karyomorph. Heterochromatic blocks were centromeric in most 

chromosomes, except for pairs No. 6, 8, 11, 19 and 20, which showed faint 

bands, in addition to telomeric marks in some chromosome pairs (Fig. 2f). 

Ag-NORs were restricted to telomeric regions of two chromosomes (Fig. 4d). 

Fluorescent regions hybridized with 18S rDNA and 5SHindIII-DNA and 

showed a pattern similar to the Tombadouro Creek sample. Additionally, the 

5S rDNA probe hybridized on the interstitial region of a small metacentric pair 

(Fig. 3e). As was the case with the Ibimirim samples, Paranaguá and Macacu 

samples were collected within the range of 2n=42A populations (JAD 

unpublished data) and were therefore assumed to be derive from these 

populations.

4.2 MOLECULAR DATA 

 

Multiple sequences 511 bp in length yielded 86 parsimony informative 

sites. Translation of these sequences into the corresponding amino acid 



 16

sequences resulted in 8 parsimony informative sites. The 

transitions:transversions ratio was 6.4, indicating that substitution rates were 

not saturated. The best model fit estimated with Modeltest and MrModeltest 

was HKY+G, which was used for NJ. In the tree, haplotypes were separated 

into 2 large clades with variable bootstrap support (Fig. 6). The largest 

bootstrap values were obtained for Haplogroup I, which was composed of the 

2n=42A karyomorph from Tombadouro Creek, Ribeira, Paranaguá and 

Macacu rivers (Fig. 1). Haplogroup II was less supported and included all 

remaining trahiras (N = 67), regardless of diploid number. Within this 

haplogroup, two subclades were highly supported: haplotypes derived from 

populations with the 2n=40F karyomorph (haplogroup IIA) and from 

populations with 2n=42A and 2n=42B karyomorphs (haplogroup IIB). 

Haplogroup IIA included all 2n=40 São Francisco trahiras, plus the Itapicuru 

River specimen. Haplogroup IIB included two well-defined lineages: one 

included haplotypes from the Doce and São Mateus rivers with no 

representatives in the Grande River, and a second lineage indicated a close 

phylogenetic relatedness between trahiras from the Jacaré (Grande River), 

the Tombadouro (São Francisco River) and the Macaé, São João, 

Itabapoana and Paraíba do Sul coastal basins. Within-haplogroup nucleotide 

molecular distances showed high levels of variation, with the smallest values 

in the São Francisco and Itapicuru samples and the largest in the IIB 

haplogroup. The range of between-haplogroup variation was much smaller 

(Table II).

5. DISCUSSION 
 

5.1 KARYOTYPIC DATA 

 

Karyomorph 2n = 40F 

 

In addition to specimens from Tombadouro Creek, all samples from 

the São Francisco drainage shared the same karyomorphic formula, which is 

considered to be characteristic for São Francisco Basin populations (Bertollo 

et al., 2000). The distributional pattern of heterochromatin was similar to that 

described by Dergam &amp;amp; Bertollo (1990) for the Três Marias population in this 

basin (Fig. 1), except for the presence of a heterochromatic block that was 

always restricted to one homologue of the first chromosome pair in males. 

This pattern suggested a probable XX/XY sex chromosome system in these 

populations, because this variant occurred only in males and was absent in 

females. This sex chromosome differentiation involving only 

heterochromatinization is a novelty within H. malabaricus, because all other 

sex chromosome systems described for this species complex involve 

translocations between chromosome pairs (for example, karyomorphs 

2n=39/40D and 2n=40/41G) (Bertollo et al., 2000), or translocation and 

heterochromatinization, as proposed for the evolution of the 2n=42B 

karyomorph from a 2n=42A karyomorph ancestor (Born &amp;amp; Bertollo, 2000). 

The 2n=40/41G karyomorph also has a large first pair of metacentrics and is 

therefore morphologically closest to the 2n=40F karyomorph. Females with 

both karyomorphs have identical karyotypes and may be sister karyomorphs 

or species. Ongoing studies including these karyomorphs, using additional 

chromosomal markers will allow for a more thorough hypothesis of the 

evolutionary origins of this sex chromosome system. 

 



 19

C-positive heterochromatic bands were always located in the 

centromeric/pericentromeric region of all chromosomes and in the telomeric 

region of some pairs, in addition to multiple Ag- NORs sites. These 

heterochromatic and NOR characteristics were similar to those reported for 

other populations or karyomorphs of H. malabaricus (Dergam &amp;amp; Bertollo, 

1990; Haaf et al., 1993; Bertollo, 1996; Bertollo et al., 1997; Born &amp;amp; Bertollo, 

2000; Vicari et al., 2003; Vicari et al., 2005). In the Pandeiros River sample, 

Ag-NORs were restricted to telomeres of some chromosomes and appeared 

in larger numbers than 18S rDNA sites, but the latter also hybridized to the 

pericentromeric region of 1 chromosome pair (Fig. 3 a). There is currently no 

explanation for the apparently nonspecific nature of some telomeric Ag-

NORs in the Pandeiros sample, which is as large as 7 in the Três Marias 

region (Dergam &amp;amp; Bertollo, 1990). On the other hand, pericentromeric 18S 

rDNA sites were not visualized by the silver nitrate method (these data and 

Dergam &amp;amp; Bertollo, 1990), which may be due to preferential telomeric NOR 

activation, as already pointed out for other trahiras’ karyomorphs (Vicari et 

al., 2005). Hybridization sites of the 5S rDNA probe were interstitially located 

in a small metacentric pair in both populations, a pattern also reported for 

trahira samples from Três Marias (Ferreira et al., 2007). The patterns 

obtained with repetitive DNA class 5SHindIII-DNA were similar to those 

obtained for the Três Marias population (Ferreira et al.,2007). 

 

Karyomorph 2n=42A 

 

The karyotypes of specimens from Tombadouro Creek and Jacaré 

River were characterized as karyomorph 2n=42A, a widespread karyotypic 

form in the Neotropics (Bertollo et al., 2000). C-banding evidenced 

conspicuous centromeric blocks in almost all chromosomes, an overall 

pattern also reported by Born &amp;amp; Bertollo (2001) for other Grande River 

2n=42A populations. High levels of Ag-NOR variation observed in the 

Tombadouro Creek population have also been reported elsewhere in the 

Grande River Basin (Born &amp;amp; Bertollo, 2001). Jacaré River trahiras showed 

Ag-NORs restricted to 1 chromosome pair, characterizing the lowest number 

of activated NORs reported so far as a fixed character state for any H. 



 20

malabaricus population. However, FISH with an 18S rDNA probe showed a 

larger number of NORs cistrons in both 2n=42A karyomorph populations. 

 

On the other hand, FISH mapping with a 5S rDNA probe revealed 

differences between the Tombadouro Creek and the Jacaré River 

populations, where they hybridized on a large submetacentric and a small 

metacentric pair, respectively. This difference contrasted with previous 

reports of other trahira populations from the Upper Paraná Basin, the Araguá 

River, where both pairs showed fluorescence with this probe (Martins et al. 

2006). Considering that at least some specimens from both basins shared 

identical haplotypes (see below), these population differences highlighted the 

great potential of this probe for population studies. 

 

Patterns of variation of 18S rDNA were substantially different from the 

ones reported by Cioffi et al. (2009). These authors indicated the presence of 

five sites in the 2n=42B karyomorph and four fluorescent sites in a 2n=42A 

karyomorph from the Upper Paraná Basin, whereas the results of this study 

showed that the same karyomorph in the Jacaré and Tombadouro 

populations had three fluorescent sites. This reduction in numbers was also 

evident in the 2n=40F karyomorph, when compared to the 2n=40C and 

2n=39/40D karyomorphs, which showed five fluorescent sites. Thus, this 

probe appears to be especially informative for studying among-karyomorph 

variation. 

 

According to the haplotype-based trees, 5SHindIII-DNA patterns 

reflected a small increase in site numbers (from 18 to 20); Cioffi et al. (2009) 

also found variation in site numbers for other 2n=42 and 2n=40 populations. 

Also, the fluorescent centromeric region in the first or second chromosome 

pairs appears to be particularly informative. The presence of the fluorescent 

region in the first chromosome pair was observed in the 2n=42A karyomorph, 

as is the case for 2n=42B, 2n=40C and 2n=39/40D karyomorphs (Cioffi et al., 

2009), representing a plesiomorphic state. On the other hand, the 2n=40F 

karyomorph showed an apparently apomorphic condition, where the 

fluorescent region occurred in the second chromosome pair. Absence of the 



 21

fluorescent site in the first chromosome pair might be attributed to a more 

recent origin of the first chromosome pair and its possible origin from 

chromosomes lacking this site. However, this hypothesis involves a 

particularly complex evolutionary process, because the persistence of diploid 

number would also involve alterations of other chromosome pairs. 

Alternatively, the 2n=40F karyomorph might have evolved directly from a 

2n=42A ancestor, causing a reduction in diploid number and producing an 

independent 2n=40 lineage. This hypothesis is consistent with the hypothesis 

of Bertollo et al. (2000), based on gross chromosome morphology, that the 

2n=40F, 2n=40/41G and 2n=42E karyomorphs represent a monophyletic 

group within H. malabaricus. 

 

In the submetacentric chromosome group, the pattern of fluorescent 

centromeric sites in three major chromosome pairs also sets apart the 

2n=40F karyomorph from other karyomorphs. The 2n=42A karyomorph and 

the three karyomorphs reported by Cioffi et al. (2009) have conspicuous 

fluorescent centromeric regions in these pairs, while this number was 

reduced to two pairs in the 2n=40F karyomorph. Homeologies among other 

chromosome pairs seem less reliable and must await further data. These 

FISH results and the presence of a unique sex chromosome system clearly 

indicate that the 2n=40F karyomorph is a taxon with the largest suit of 

derived karyotypic characters in this species complex. 

 

5.2 MOLECULAR DATA 

 

Molecular data are congruent with the cytogenetic results and suggest 

a long reproductive isolation between the karyomorphs. Haplogroup I 

included some of the 2n=42A karyomorph haplotypes from the Tombadouro 

Creek and haplotypes derived from three coastal basins located south of the 

Paraíba do Sul River. This haplogroup showed low levels of within variation, 

suggesting that these haplotypes were closely related. Some haplogroup II 

haplotypes were sympatric with haplogroup I haplotypes at the Tombadouro 

Creek. Within haplogroup IIB, all haplotypes from the Grande River were 

closely related to haplotypes from four coastal basins. These haplotypes 



 22

showed a sister group relationship with haplotypes from the São Mateus and 

Doce coastal basins that were not represented in samples from the São 

Francisco and Grande rivers. Some 2n=42 trahiras from the Tombadouro 

Creek and Jacaré River shared identical haplotypes, suggesting a recent 

range expansion from the Grande to the São Francisco basins. 

 

These results provide insights into the evolution of H. malabaricus 

karyomorphs and the history of contact between coastal and continental 

hydrological basins. The most inclusive study of ND2 and ATPase 6 

divergence between freshwater fishes is Bermingham et al. (1997), who 

estimated a rate of divergence for this gene segment of 1.3% per million 

years. Overall sequence (p-distance) divergence of the divergent haplogroup 

I haplotypes versus haplogroup II haplotypes would suggest a lineage split at 

4.2 million years ago, an age that is younger than the inferred Amazon-

Paranean vicariance, which has been dated at 11.8–10 million years ago 

(reviewed in Lundberg et al., 1998). This isolation left 2n=42 and 2n=40 

karyomorphs in both basins (Bertollo et al., 2000), indicating that karyotypic 

evolution was well underway during Late Miocene Epoch. Miocene fossils are 

also considered to be similar to present-day taxa (Lundberg, 1998). The 

information content of molecular variation of this species complex may be 

more elusive: a preliminary analysis of ATPase 6 sequences in H. 

malabaricus populations from the Amazon-Paranean boundary basins 

reveals two clades that show large differences in p-distance divergence 

within each clade (0.10 and 0.34% per million years, respectively) (JAD, 

unpublished data), suggesting that molecular evolution within the H. 

malabaricus complex may be highly variable and influenced by other causes. 

Factors such as efficiency in DNA repair mechanism (Britten, 1986), 

generation time (Wu &amp;amp; Li, 1985), metabolic rate (Martin &amp;amp; Palumbi, 1993) and 

demographic processes (Ohta, 2002) may affect substitution rates among 

taxa. Hence, it is plausible to hypothesize a strong effect of demographic 

processes on the rates of molecular substitution in these populations, 

considering the close phylogenetic relationships among H. malabaricus 

karyomorphs and the adaptation of trahiras to life in small populations–which 

is also reflected in their high levels of karyotypical variation. Slightly 



 23

disadvantageous substitutions can drift to high frequencies in small 

populations (Ohta, 2002), thereby altering substitution rates in the DNA. 

Therefore, trahiras and other species with similar ecology may be particularly 

poor candidates for using the molecular clock hypothesis to estimate 

divergence times. In the highly migratory species, Prochilodus spp., 

substitution rates of ATPase 6,8 range from 0.8–2.5% (Sivasundar et al., 

2001), suggesting haplotypes in H. malabaricus are among the most 

divergent in the Neotropical region. The present study is the first to indicate 

such a deep molecular divergence within the same karyomorph, although 

deep cytochrome b divergences were also observed among populations of 

the catfish Pimelodus albicans in the River Plate Basin (Vergara et al., 2008). 

 

The location where lineage splitting occurred is limited to the 

distribution of current karyomorphs. The Paraná Basin harbours at least three 

karyomorphs, while the 2n=40F karyomorph appears to be widespread in the 

São Francisco Basin, and the 2n=42A karyomorph is apparently restricted to 

the Pará River headwaters. North-eastern coastal populations harbour the 

2n=40F karyomorph as far as the Buranhém River to the south (JAD, 

unpubl.) (Fig. 1), and these haplotypes had the lowest degree of divergence. 

This macro-geographical pattern suggests that lineage splitting occurred 

elsewhere and not in the relatively isolated São Francisco Basin. In 

haplogroup IIB, the close relationship between the 2n=42A and 2n=42B 

karyomorphs indicated that karyotypical differentiation involved few 

alterations that resulted in a differentiated XX/XY chromosome system 

(Bertollo et al., 2000). 

 

5.3 STREAM PIRACY 

 

On a local scale, the apparently restricted range of the Tombadouro 

Creek 2n=42A karyomorph may have resulted from stream piracy from a 

former Jacaré River tributary. The Tombadouro Creek is 12 km from the 

Jacaré across the Galga water Divisor. Three hypotheses might explain this 

dispersal. First, boundary crossing may have resulted from either human 

mediated activities. For example, the connection may have been destroyed 



 24

by the construction of BR 494 Highway, which is 8 km away at its closest 

point from the Tombadouro Creek. Second, dispersal may have occurred 

through a high-altitude wetland that used to drain into both basins. Third, 

headwater capture in the region may have occurred by relatively recent 

reactivation of ancient faults (Saadi et al., 2002). Altitudinal characteristics 

are also consistent with the direction of stream capture. Tombadouro is at 

860 m altitude, whereas the Jacaré River is at 1038 m. This area is within the 

range of a continental fault known as the Upper Grande River Crustal 

Discontinuity (Saadi et al., 2002). This fault represents the southern limit of 

the São Francisco craton and the movable belts of southern Minas Gerais 

State (Fig. 1) and has been active in the last 15 000 years. 

 

The phylogenetic origins of two highly divergent haplotypes in the 

Tombadouro Creek became clear only after haplotypes from coastal basins 

were included in the analysis. Most critically, haplotypes found in sympatry in 

the São Francisco River are related to haplotypes in different coastal basins. 

Under the allopatric model of speciation, this asymmetry suggests that 

ancestral fish dispersed from the coastal to the continental drainages, and 

the present study is the first to indicate unambiguously the direction of this 

dispersal. However, the timing of the dispersal between coastal and inland 

drainages could not be estimated, because molecular clock expectations are 

not suitable for trahiras. Therefore, the phylogeographic history this group 

does not fit any of the three phylogenetic patterns proposed by Ribeiro 

(2006). On the other hand, low genetic divergence between the São 

Francisco and Itapicuru drainages may be part of a recent faunal exchange 

in the arid region of north-eastern Brazil that is apparent in many other 

species of fish (Rosa et al., 2004). 

 

Ribeiro (2006) indicated that the Atlantic drainages (Doce, Paraíba do 

Sul and Ribeira) have existed since the breakup of Gondwana. The results of 

the present study suggested that populations in these basins represent three 

biogeographic units, for which only two have close representatives in the 

boundaries of the Jacaré and Pará drainages. Dergam et al. (2002) 

previously reported a close phylogenetic relatedness between two 



 25

haplotypes in the Doce and lower Grande river basins. Fish dispersal from 

coastal to continental drainages may have been restricted to only a few taxa 

adapted to headwater conditions, because coastal drainages are 

characterized by high levels of endemism (Ribeiro, 2006) and the Proterozoic 

Mantiqueira Range is considered to be an efficient barrier between coastal 

and continental drainages (Ingenito &amp;amp; Buckup, 2007). To the south, stream 

piracy has been particularly intensive in the Paraíba do Sul, Ribeira and 

Upper Paraná basins (Ribeiro, 2006). 

 

The present study provided important information on the population 

distribution of H. malabaricus in São Francisco Basin and on historical 

relationships with populations in the Grande and coastal basins. The 2n=40F 

karyomorph and its associated haplotypes were widely distributed throughout 

the São Francisco Basin, maintaining an apparently stable karyotypic 

structure of the chromosomal markers analyzed here. This karyomorph was 

characterized by a XX/XY sex chromosome system. In contrast, the 2n=42A 

karyomorph showed a more restricted distribution in São Francisco Basin 

and was closely associated with populations in a Grande River Basin 

tributary, where the 2n=42A karyomorph predominated. However, the 

2n=42A karyomorph populations isolated in drainages showed striking 

differences for some markers, notably the Ag-NORs and 5S rDNA sites. The 

patterns of variation in repetitive DNA sequences as revealed by 5S rDNA 

probes indicated that these markers appeared to be useful population 

markers, showing significant differences among localities and karyomorphs. 

Patterns of 5SHindIII-DNA variation yielded the largest phylogenetic signal 

and placed the 2n=40F karyomorph in a high position in the phylogeny of 

karyomorphs that occur in eastern Brazil. 

 

Given the current status of phylogenetic data, an understanding of 

distribution patterns for H. malabaricus will be particularly challenging. 

Studies of the distribution patterns of freshwater fishes have considered 

endemism (e.g. Vari, 1988), faunal composition including endemic and 

widespread species (Hubert &amp;amp; Renno, 2006), molecular data (Sivasundar et 

al., 2001; Montoya-Burgos, 2003) or a combination of morphological and 



 26

molecular data (Menezes et al., 2008). When integrated into a wider 

geographic context, molecular and cytogenetic patterns can be informative of 

faunal dispersals between drainages. The results of the present study 

suggested that recent fish dispersal may occur even within apparently stable 

geological regions and that headwater stream piracy between coastal and 

continental (Upper Paraná tributaries) basins may have played a role in 

producing the high levels of freshwater fish diversity in the Neotropics. 

 

Finally, the topology of mtDNA-based tree suggests that the proposal 

of Dergam &amp;amp; Bertollo (1990) to separate species by diploid numbers would 

result in a paraphyletic arrangement, in which some trahiras haplotypes 

associated with 2n=42 karyomorphs would be more closely related to trahiras 

with 2n=40 karyomorphs than to other fish with 2n=42 karyomorphs. 

Although haplogroup I appeared as the sister group of the remaining trahiras, 

haplogroup II is less supported and the possible ancestry of karyomorphs 

must wait for more data. A time frame for dispersal between coastal and 

continental drainages is elusive for the H. malabaricus species complex. 

Nevertheless, geographical isolation during coastal diversification has 

enhanced speciation processes and genetic isolation between karyomorphs, 

a process that has resulted in molecular and cytogenetic differentiation 

between populations. These results are consistent with the existence of 

multiple independent lineages that can be easily detected with standard 

cytogenetic techniques. 

 

Although trahiras are common members of lowland freshwater 

communities (Bonetto et al., 1969; Winemiller, 1991), at least part of their 

widespread distribution in the Neotropics is due to their ability to dwell in 

high-altitude headwaters, such as in the Jacaré and Tombadouro localities. 

The question of how this nonmigratory sedentary species has adapted to 

sluggish waters and to waters in high altitudes is not explained by current 

geological data. Nevertheless, this broad ecological diversity indicates a long 

history of trahiras in south-eastern Brazil.
