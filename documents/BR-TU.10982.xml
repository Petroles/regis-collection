resumo 
 
 

Fruto da constante evolução da ciência e da tecnologia, referências ao 
uso de novos fluídos surgem a um ritmo cada vez maior. Novos refrigerantes, 
mais “amigos” do ambiente, líquidos iónicos, uma nova classe de solventes 
ou perfluorocarbonetos, moléculas capazes de dissolver suficiente oxigénio 
para poderem ser utilizadas como substitutas do sangue ou como fonte de 
oxigénio em processos biotecnológicos ou ainda como surfactantes em 
processos de extracção supercrítica com dióxido de carbono, são apenas 
alguns dos novos exemplos. 

Para o design correcto de produtos e processos envolvendo estes novos 
fluídos, o conhecimento de algumas das suas propriedades termofísicas é 
fundamental. Embora a medição experimental seja o procedimento mais 
rigoroso para a determinação de qualquer propriedade termofísica, muitas 
das vezes, estas medições são morosas e caras. As gamas de temperatura, 
pressão e composição de interesse podem ainda ser tais que tornam as 
medições experimentais inexequíveis sendo a solução mais conveniente a 
utilização de um modelo teórico, empírico ou misto que devolve o valor da 
propriedade termofísica nas condições desejadas com uma razoável 
exactidão. 

O contributo desta dissertação de doutoramento é maioritariamente para 
o estudo de moléculas lineares de diferentes tamanhos de cadeia, com um 
especial ênfase para misturas assimétricas. A família dos n-alcanos por 
apresentar um imenso interesse industrial a nível da indústria petrolífera e 
petroquímica, quer porque as suas propriedades permitem a sua utilização 
como materiais termoactivos em isolamento ou armazenamento de energia, 
quer ainda por ser uma família modelo para tantas outras moléculas, como 
surfactantes, ácidos gordos ou polímeros, foi seleccionada para esse efeito. 

Várias medições foram realizadas em sistemas cuja escassez ou 
inexistência de dados experimentais foi verificada. Tensões superficiais, 
tensões interfaciais, densidades e viscosidades da fase líquida foram 
determinadas para um conjunto significativo de fluídos em gamas alargadas 
de temperatura e composição, tendo sido dada especial atenção a sistemas 
assimétricos de n-alcanos e a algumas fracções de petróleo, representativas 
de sistemas reais. 

Diferentes metodologias foram adoptadas para a modelação dos 
resultados obtidos, com o cuidado de avaliar alguns dos modelos 
termodinâmicos que constituem o estado-da-arte, tendo sido demonstrado 
que um novo modelo baseado no Princípio dos Estados Correspondentes 
introduz melhorias consideráveis na modelação quando comparado com 
modelos convencionais.

abstract 
 

As a result of the continuous scientific and technological developments,  
several new fluids of interest are showing up every day. New refrigerants, more 
environmentally friendly, ionic liquids, a new class of solvents or 
perfluoroalkanes, molecules able to dissolve enough oxygen in order to be 
used as blood substitutes or oxygen carrier agents in biotechnological 
processes or as surfactants in supercritical carbon dioxide extraction, are a few 
examples. 

For the correct product and process design of these new fluids, knowledge 
of some thermophysical properties are required. Although the experimental 
measurement is the most rigorous procedure for evaluating any thermophysical 
property, frequently these are expensive and time-consuming. The 
temperature, pressure and composition ranges of interest may also be so 
broad that the measurements may be unfeasible, with a common solution 
being the use of a theoretical, empirical or semi-empirical model that returns 
the thermophysical property at the desired conditions with a considerable 
accuracy. 

This thesis contributes to the study of various thermophysical properties of 
nonpolar molecules of different chain lengths, with a special emphasis on 
asymmetric mixtures. The n-alkane family was chosen for that purpose since it  
has a vast industrial interest, starting from the petrochemical industry to 
termoactive phase change materials, for energy storage and release. It can 
also be regarded as a reference family for studying other molecules such as 
surfactants, fatty acids or polymers. 

A number of experimental measurements were performed in systems 
were data deficiency was found. Properties such as vapor-liquid and liquid-
liquid interfacial tensions and liquid phase densities and viscosities were 
measured for a significant number of fluids in broad ranges of temperature and 
composition. A special emphasis was put on asymmetric n-alkane mixtures and 
some petroleum fractions, representative of real systems. 

Several methodologies were adopted for modeling the obtained results, 
and for that purpose some state-of-the-art thermodynamic models were 
evaluated. As will be demonstrated an improved Corresponding States model  
enhanced considerably model accuracy.

General Introduction 

 

As a result of the systematic demand for new products, the nature and number of 

different chemicals in which we may be interested in is increasing considerably. In fact, in 

a short period of time, the chemical industry has changed from the production of a tiny 

number of small molecules to the large-scale production of a huge number of chemicals 

with broad compositional, structural and size differences. 

Thermophysical properties are frequently required both for product and process 

design, and in many cases these are scarce or unavailable. During process design, 

knowledge of thermophysical properties is essential for determining the optimum process 

conditions, concerning steps as different as distillation, extraction, adsorption, reaction, 

heat and mass transfer and fluid transport. From the viewpoint of product design, various 

properties may determine the selection of a specific fluid for a particular purpose, for 

example viscosity for lubricants, surface tension for detergents, vapor pressure for 

perfumes or thermal conductivity for insulating materials. To develop products with 

improved performance, we thus need a good knowledge of the function-determining 

thermophysical properties. 

One of the most well documented families of chemicals is that of n-alkanes. Many of 

the measurements available so far were done due to the importance that alkanes have for 

the petroleum industry. In the past, the focus has been on light oils and for this reason data 



General Introduction  

- xxvi - 

for compounds above n-hexadecane (n-C16H34) are scarce with the available data covering 

only a narrow temperature range. 

Advances in oil extraction technology, founded on the progressive reservoir depletion, 

are enabling the additional recovery of heavier oils, rising oil lifetime (Ali, 2003; 

Babadagli, 2003). The mixture of heavier and lighter components makes the new oils 

heavier and more asymmetric, and thus, the increasing interest in heavier and asymmetric 

n-alkane mixtures. 

Mixtures containing lighter and heavier compounds, can also be found at another 

industries such as those producing paints and polymers. 

Another recent interest on the use of heavy n-alkanes, in the form of the cheap paraffin 

wax, is related to energy management (storage and release) provided by phase change 

materials (Farid et al., 2004). In these materials, a broad melting temperature range is used 

to store or release latent heat by means of the solid-liquid phase change. Typically these 

materials should have a large melting latent heat, high thermal conductivity, a melting 

temperature in the desired working range, melt congruently with no subcooling, be low in 

cost, chemically stable, non-toxic and non-corrosive. Some difficulties are now being 

addressed, particularly those related to low thermal conductivity, density change, stability 

of properties under cycling, flammability and, less frequently, subcooling  

(Farid et al., 2004). Some of the applications of paraffin wax as a phase change material 

are solar energy storage, temperature controlled clothing for athletes and campers and 

household heating and insulation. 

As the industrial interest in most of the heavier components was small till recently, the 

available experimental data is particularly reduced. Because the experimental measurement 

of thermophysical properties is an expensive and time-consuming procedure, the 

alternative is to select models from which the desired properties can be obtained within the 

required accuracy. Although several models have been proposed, it is still essential to carry 

out some experimental measurements on new systems of interest in order to assess their 

limitations and provide a basis for the development of improved models. 

During the work conducted for this thesis a particular attention was devoted to two 

somewhat neglected thermophysical properties: interfacial tension and viscosity. Some 

liquid density measurements were performed and vapor pressures, thermal conductivities 



General Introduction 

   - xxvii - 

and speeds of sounds were addressed on the modeling part. Thermal analysis of some 

petroleum distillation cuts by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) were also 

performed. 

The importance of interfacial tension for the petroleum industry extends far beyond 

the extraction process, when oil has to travel through capillary channels and where this 

type of flow is strongly dominated by surface tension effects. In fact, it is not unusual in 

the extraction of crudes to add surfactants to modify the interfacial properties between 

crude oil and the geological reservoir (Farid et al., 2004). Other operations such as 

multiphase transport in pipelines, adsorption, distillation or extraction also rely on this 

property. Outside the refinery, the environmental concerns about oil spills, both on sea and 

fresh waters, are a field where the study of the oil-water interface can provide important 

information, since it can determine the path, transport mechanisms and fate of organic 

pollutants in the environment. Other industries were interfacial tensions arising from long 

alkyl chains are important are those producing coatings, paints, detergents, cosmetics and 

agrochemicals. 

Other valuable properties to model oil extraction from reservoirs are viscosity and 

liquid density. The importance of viscosity is well known. All equations expressing the 

flow of fluids contain this property, and several product characteristics can be largely 

determined by its magnitude. Lubricants and paints are examples of products for which the 

viscosity is one of the key properties. Generally, it is much easier to find open literature 

studies of phase equilibria rather than studies on non-equilibrium properties such as 

viscosity. Although literature data have been substantially increased over the last few 

decades, information about asymmetric or heavy systems is still scarce. 

This thesis is organized in three parts, that deal separately with the experimental 

details, results and discussion (Part I), data correlation (Part II) and modeling of 

experimental data using some state-of-the-art and new thermodynamic models (Part III). 

This separation allows the reader to select one or more chapters without having to go 

through the entire text. 

Part I details the experimental apparatuses used to measure vapor-liquid and liquid-

liquid interfacial tensions, viscosities and liquid densities on a group of pure and mixed n-

alkanes, with a special attention devoted to asymmetric mixtures. Measurements were

performed in broad temperature and composition ranges and results are reported on tables 

together with their estimated uncertainties. Some chain length effects on the results will be 

discussed in this chapter. Finally some measurements on petroleum distillation cuts, 

representative of real fluids will also be presented. 

Part II deals with data correlation. An overview of critical properties and an 

assessment of correlations to extend the available data for those n-alkanes for which there 

is no experimental evidence is first presented and discussed, since these are fundamental 

for modeling purposes. Afterwards, correlating relations among some of the measured 

properties are presented. Some interesting results relating surface tension to viscosity will 

be presented at this point showing that its possible to relate equilibrium properties with 

transport properties. 

Part III addresses various thermodynamic models for the estimation of thermophysical 

properties, with a special attention devoted to the properties measured on Part I: interfacial 

tensions, viscosities and liquid densities. Some emphasis was put on corresponding states 

models (section III.2) since these are the most versatile (the same formalism can be applied 

for different properties), require a small amount of experimental information, and are, in 

spite of their simplicity, surprisingly accurate. It will be shown that with a simple, 

theoretically sound extension, these models can be selected for the prediction of several 

properties of pure and mixed, lighter and heavier n-alkanes with average deviations 

comparable to the experimental uncertainties. 

On section III.3 preliminary results on the coupling of the gradient theory of fluid 

interfaces with an association equation of state, the Cubic-Plus-Association (CPA) 

equation of state for the simultaneous modeling of the equilibrium pressures and densities, 

and interfacial tensions will be presented. The advantage of this combination is the 

possibility of modeling the important aqueous-hydrocarbon liquid-liquid (and vapor-liquid) 

interfaces for more complex systems, were phase equilibrium needs to be considered. 

Results will also be presented from the friction theory for viscosity modeling, a new 

state-of the-art model based on the attractive and repulsive pressures calculated from a 

cubic equation of state. During this section (III.4) the liquid density estimates obtained 

from a cubic equation of state will also be presented and discussed. 



General Introduction 

   - xxix - 

Finally, taking advantage of the thermal behavior of the distillation cuts determined on 

Part I, modeling of these results will be presented on section III.5 using a simple model 

that has demonstrated to be able to correctly describe solid-liquid equilibrium of petroleum 

fluids (Coutinho, 1998; Coutinho et al., 2002; Mirante et al., 2001; Dauphin et al., 1999; 

Daridon et al., 2001).

I.1. Introduction 

 

Since most of the available experimental data on thermophysical properties appeared 

due to industry needs, there is still a huge amount of molecules to study. Of course, it is 

impossible (both expensive and time consuming) to carry out all the required experimental 

measurements on all interesting molecules and their mixtures in broad temperature, 

pressure and composition conditions. And the uncertainty required for the desired property 

may not always be small. For this reason, models are regularly used, but, since models 

always introduce some simplifications, one should first check their performance for the 

estimation of a small amount of experimental data, representative of the system(s) under 

study. 

In the particular case of asymmetric n-alkane mixtures, surface tension and viscosity 

are among the most important thermophysical properties, those that present the smallest 

amount of experimental information. Liquid densities can easily be found for some 

mixtures of lighter components, but when one of the components involved is heavier than 

n-eicosane, the amount of experimental data is again, scarce. 

Pure, binary and ternary mixtures as well as some petroleum distillation cuts from 

different origins were measured. Compositions and thermal behavior of the later were 

determined using Gas Chromatography (Hewlett Packard 6890) and Differential Scanning 

Calorimetry (Setaram DSC 141). 



Part I: Experimental 

- 4 - 

Lighter pure n-alkanes were chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the measuring 

methods, while heavier n-alkanes were measured since data for most of these fluids are 

still lacking. Some mixtures, especially asymmetric n-alkane mixtures were selected. For 6 

binary and 2 ternary mixtures all of the referred properties were measured at the same 

compositions and temperatures in order to examine the effect of chain length and 

asymmetry. Ternary mixtures, consisting of n-heptane (or n-decane) + n-eicosane + n-

tetracosane were prepared with equal mole fractions of n-eicosane and n-tetracosane in 

order to compare the results with the binary mixture n-heptane (or n-decane) + n-docosane. 

Crude oil fractions were chosen to represent real fluids. The results obtained will serve as a 

basis to the extrapolation, of the selected models to systems of practical interest. 

A viscometer and a densimeter from Anton Paar and a Nima tensiometer were chosen 

for the measurements reported in this chapter. Although other measuring techniques with 

higher precisions can be selected for the measurement of these thermophysical properties 

(Rusanov, 1996; Wakeham et al., 1991), these equipment have shown to present the right 

balance between accuracy, precision, measuring time and amount of sample. One big 

disadvantage of these apparatuses is that measurements can only be performed at a set of 

different temperatures, without any pressure control, with the system pressure being 

roughly the atmospheric pressure. So, the reported results that will follow are not 

saturation-line properties. Still, as the dependence of the selected properties on pressure is 

small in the considered temperature range (283.15 K – 343.15 K), results can also be 

compared with saturation results as will be latter shown. 

Measurements were performed from 283.15 K (or slightly above the fluid melting 

point) up to 343.15 K in temperature intervals of 10 K. This temperature range, although 

superiorly limited by the working range of the Anton Paar densimeter, shall present 

enough experimental information for describing the temperature influence on the selected 

thermophysical properties. It also permits to gather important information about the low-

temperature behavior of the selected fluids. 

For the considered binary mixtures, the full composition range was studied, allowing 

some insights about the composition effects on the measured properties. 

All the results will be presented according to the International System of Units 

(Taylor, 1995), together with their estimated uncertainties, by the use of the law of the

propagation of uncertainty (Taylor et al., 1994), considering the individual uncertainties of 

the variables involved on the measurements. These calculations, together with a 

comparison with available literature data will give a good overview on the precision and 

accuracy of the reported results.

Vapor–liquid and liquid-liquid interfacial tensions, liquid densities and viscosities are 

reported for some pure, binary and ternary n-alkane mixtures, and some petroleum 

distillation cuts representative of real systems. Interfacial tensions were measured using a 

NIMA DST 9005 Dynamic Surface Tensiometer based on the Wilhelmy plate method 

(vapor-liquid interfaces) and the Du Noüy ring method (liquid-liquid interfaces). Liquid 

densities were determined using an Anton Paar DMA 58 vibrating U-tube densimeter and 

viscosities from an Anton Paar AMV8 rolling ball viscometer. 

Thermal analysis from Differential Scanning Calorimetry using a  

Setaram DSC 141 calorimeter and compositions from gas chromatography using an 

Hewlett Packard 6890 chromatograph of the reported petroleum distillation cuts are also 

presented and discussed. 

Results are reported on tables together with their estimated uncertainties. 

 

I.2. Experimental Methods, Results and Discussion 

 

I.2.1. Interfacial Tension 

 

A NIMA DST 9005 tensiometer from NIMA Technology, Ltd. was used for these 

measurements. It incorporates a microbalance (Peterson, 1997) able to read force within 

10-6 mN, which was operated on the Wilhelmy plate method (Rusanov et al., 1996) for the 



Part I: Experimental

liquid-vapor interfacial tensions and on the Du Noüy ring method (Rusanov et al., 1996; 

Harkins et al., 1930; Freud et al., 1930; Huh et al., 1975) for the liquid-liquid interfacial 

tensions (Figure I. 1). 

The plate (or ring) is connected to the microbalance and afterwards immersed and 

detached from the evaluating interface, resulting on a total force (F) which, when the 

contact angle (? ) is zero (Figure I. 1), can be separated into the following three 

components: 

 

lenghtwettedtensionerfacialintthrustupweightF ×+?=    (I. 1) 

 

Before making any measurements the balance is zeroed, thereby eliminating the 

weight term. 

At the interface, the up thrust is zero and so, the force measured by the balance is only 

due to the interfacial tension: 

 

lenghtwettedtensionerfacialintF erfaceint ×=      (I. 2) 

 

Generally, the interfacial tension is thus given by: 

 

lenghtwetted

F erfaceint=?         (I. 3) 

 

where ? is the interfacial tension, in N.m-1. 

When the contact angle between the ring (or plate) and the measuring interface is 

different from zero (Figure I. 1), the force measured by the balance has to be corrected:

where d is the ring outer diameter and t is the wire thickness. 

The Wilhelmy plate method is an absolute method, since it does not require any 

hydrostatic correction. This would suggest using this method for all the measurements. 

Unfortunately, only with some liquid-vapor interfaces we can guarantee that the angle ? 

formed between the lower edge of the plate and the interface is zero. 

Two reasons were thus involved in the selection of different measuring methods for 

liquid-liquid and liquid-vapor interfaces. The first is the need of density data required for 

the ring method, and not needed with the plate, making the last very convenient for 

vapor-liquid interfaces were complete wetting of the Wilhelmy plate can be obtained  

(?  = 0). On the other hand, for liquid –liquid interfaces, complete wetting is best assured 

by the use of the Du Noüy ring where, due to its circular shape and the largest wetting 

perimeter, can be withdrawn with a zero contact angle. However, with this method, an 

hydrostatic correction is required due to the pull up of measuring fluid on the inner side of 

the ring.

correction depends on the difference of mass densities between the involved phases, and it 

is automatically performed by the tensiometer acquisition software after inputting the 

density difference. 

Plate perimeter and ring diameter and thickness were first measured within ±10 µm 

and are introduced in the acquisition software. Platinum plates and rings were used. 

Dimensions of the Wilhelmy plate were 20.20 mm width and 0.18 mm thickness and those 

of the Du Noüy ring 20.75 mm diameter and 500 µm wire thickness. From the force 

measurements and the plate (or ring) dimensions, this tensiometer automatically returns 

interfacial tension values. 

This tensiometer can also be used to measure force, contact angles and dynamic 

interfacial tension. Several measurement parameters can be easily changed giving this 

equipment considerable versatility (Martin et al., 1999). 

All of the used chemicals were commercial products with a stated purity of at least 

98%: n-heptane (Riedel de Haën, ?  99 %), n-decane (Aldrich, ?  99 %), n-hexadecane 

(Sigma, ?  99 %), n-eicosane (Sigma, ?  99 %), n-docosane (Fluka, ?  98 %) and  

n-tetracosane (Fluka, ?  99 %). Liquid room-temperature n-alkanes (n-heptane, n-decane, 

and n-hexadecane) were dried over molecular sieves. For the vapor-liquid interfacial 

tensions no further purification was carried out, while for liquid-liquid (water + n-alkane) 

measurements, the n-alkanes were first purified by column chromatography with basic 

alumina, since it was earlier reported that trace contaminants in the n-alkanes could be 

enriched in the aqueous-n-alkane interface, reducing the interfacial tensions  

(Goebel et al., 1997; Gaonkar et al., 1984). For the n-alkanes heavier than n-C16H34, no 

such effect was observed, while for the lower ones, results were considerably improved 

after column chromatography. 

For the measurements, approximately 50 cm3 of each liquid phase were introduced in 

a thermostated glass vessel. Temperature was controlled within 0.01 K by an external 

Pt100 probe directly immersed on the system and connected to an HAAKE F6 circulator. 

The accuracy of this temperature measuring system was assured by calibration against a 

certified Thermometrics S10 thermistor. Average absolute deviation (Eq. I.7) was smaller 

than 0.04 with a maximum deviation of -0.07 K at 319.72 K:

where m is the number of data points, X is the measured temperature in K and 

subscript a stands for the accepted value from the thermistor. 

Mixtures were carefully prepared by weighting the components in a Mettler Toledo 

AB204 analytical balance (± 0.0001 g). Uncertainty in mole fraction was calculated to be 

less than 2×10-5. 

Balance and tensiometer were calibrated with masses provided by the manufacturers. 

Before the measurements, the glass vessel was carefully cleaned with water and 

detergent to completely remove the previous sample. After that, the vessel was washed 

with plenty of distilled water and dried before use. The glass vessel was regularly soaked 

in 5M nitric acid in order to remove any extra contaminant. Surfactant-free paper was used 

for cleaning purposes. 

Special precautions were taken to avoid evaporation of the more volatile components 

such as n-heptane and n-decane during the mixture measurements. For that purpose, the 

tensiometer was hermetically closed and a small portion of these components was 

introduced inside the tensiometer chamber in order to saturate the gas phase. Humidity was 

removed from the tensiometer chamber using dried silica gel. 

Before each vapor-liquid measurement, the plate was flamed in a Bunsen burner in 

order to eliminate contaminants. 

For the liquid-liquid interfacial tensions the Du Noüy ring was immersed in an acidic 

mixture (20% conc. HCl + 20% conc. HNO3) for 15 minutes and after that washed with 

plenty of ultra-pure water, since it was reported previously that flame cleaning could 

promote the adsorption of non-polar species to the ring while measuring  

aqueous-hydrocarbon interfaces (Gaonkar et al., 1984; Lunkenheimer, 1989). 

The interface was cleaned by suction with a Pasteur pipette and discarded. This allows 

the removal of some surface-active contaminants and the formation of a new and clean 

interface.

During the measurements, the Wilhelmy plate or the Du Noüy ring were immersed and 

detached from the interface, after the liquid level was automatically determined by the 

tensiometer. Interfacial tension was obtained from the maximum value of the plot 

interfacial tension vs. immersion depth while the plate or ring was detached. For each 

system, at least 9 interfacial tension values were recorded, from which an average was 

taken. 

For the water-n-alkane interfacial tensions, the first step was the introduction of  

ultra-pure water on the measuring vessel. After that, the ring was immersed to determine 

the liquid level and then it was totally immersed on the aqueous phase so that the 

measuring part of the Du Noüy ring never touched the n-alkane phase over it. The n-alkane 

was then carefully transferred to the measuring vessel, and after a period of time necessary 

to reach the desired thermal equilibrium at the target temperature, plus 15 minutes, the 

measurement started. Since with the Du Noüy ring the maximum force is obtained without 

breaking the interface, the ring was always wetted by the aqueous phase. If, somehow, the 

ring broke the interface during the measurement, all the procedure was repeated, since the 

contact with the organic phase makes the ring hydrophobic (Gaonkar et al., 1984 ; 

Lunkenheimer, 1989). 

An initial set of pure component measurements was carried out to evaluate the ability 

of the measuring system to reproduce literature data. Pure component interfacial tension 

was measured from 273.15 K (or above the melting point) up to 343.15 K. 

Results are reported and compared with literature values (Jasper et al.,1953; McLure 

et al. 1982; Jasper, 1972; Koefoed et al. 1958; Águila-Hernandez, 1987;  

Jasper et al., 1955). in Table I. 1 and Figure I. 2. 

The uncertainty reported in this table heading (± 0.03 mN.m-1) is the maximum 

uncertainty found from all data. This was evaluated using the law of propagation of 

uncertainty in which force, plate dimensions and temperature were considered (Taylor et 

al., 1994). 

Deviations were calculated using percent average absolute deviations  

(% AAD, Eq. I.7), where m is the number of data points, X is the interfacial tension and the 

subscript a stands for the accepted (literature) values. An overall average absolute 

deviation of 1.2 % was obtained. No literature data was found for n-tetracosane. The 



Part I: Experimental 

- 14 - 

maximum deviation was 2.6 % for n-hexadecane at 293.15 K, compared with the data from 

Koefoed et al. (1958). In Figure I. 2 n-heptane results are presented, where data from 

Grigoryev et al., (1992) taken at different temperatures from our measurements, are also 

included. The measured data agrees with the data previously reported as much as the 

different sets of data agree between themselves. 

It should be noted that for n-docosane and n-tetracosane, at the lowest temperatures, 

surface tension decreases with decreasing temperature, an opposite trend to what is 

generally found. This phenomenon is particular of some heavy n-alkanes with chain length 

14 &amp;lt;n ?  50, some alcohols and liquid crystals and is ascribed to surface freezing, where 

the surface presents solid ordering before the bulk liquid does, around 3 K above the 

melting point (Penfold, 2001; Wu et al., 1993; Earnshaw et al., 1992).

Mixture data were measured above 293.15 K. and are presented on Tables I.2- I.3. 

Reported uncertainty corresponds, again, to the maximum uncertainty found from all the 

mixture points. The calculation procedure was the same used for the pure components, this 

time including also the uncertainty due to mixture preparation. 

A comparison with mixture reported values from Koefoed et al. (1958),  

Águila-Hernandez (1987), Pugachevich et al.(1979) and Pandey et al. (1982) is presented 

on Figures I.3 - I.5. 

Pandey et al. (1982) reported 4 mixture data points (0.05&amp;lt;x n-C16H34&amp;lt;0.40) for the 

system n-decane + n-hexadecane at 303.16 K. Koefoed et al. (1958) and  

Pugachevich et al (1979) presented data for the mixture n-heptane + n-hexadecane at 

293.15 K, 303.15 K, 333.15 K and 373.15 K. Águila-Hernandez (1987) presented full 

composition data for the mixture n-hexadecane + n-eicosane from 323.15 K up to  

353.15 K. Visual inspection can be used to conclude that although our equipment seems to 

give systematically higher values than those reported on literature, small deviations are 

observed, which can guarantee that our measurements should have considerable accuracy.

It should also be noted that for the system n-heptane + n-hexadecane, data reported by 

Koefoed et al. (1958) for n-hexadecane presented the highest deviation from our data, as 

can be seen in Table I. 1. Mixture data from Pugachevich et al. (1979) are systematically 

lower than that reported either in this work or by Koefoed et al. (1958).

For the mixture n-hexadecane + n-eicosane, our data is somewhat higher than that 

reported by Águila-Hernandez (1987), but small deviations are observed. Average absolute 

deviations (Eq. I.7) for the pure components are 0.7 % and 0.9%, respectively for n-

hexadecane and n-eicosane. For the other mixtures, no data was previously available. 

The curvature presented as a function of composition, where the mixture surface 

tension is higher than the corresponding mole fraction average, is typical of n-alkane 

mixtures. The opposite trend is commonly observed in mixtures containing other families 

of fluids. These differences are the consequence of the different surface compositions that 

will result in the minimum free energy of the system.

The ternary mixtures n-C7H16 (or n-C10H22) + n-C20H42 + n-C24H50 were studied at 

equimolar compositions of n-C20H42 and n-C24H50 to allow for a comparison of this ternary 

data with those of the binaries n-C7H16 (or n-C10H22) + n-C22H46. These systems are plotted 

on Figures I.6-I.7 as a function of n-heptane and n-decane mole fractions, respectively. As 

can be seen from this figures and Tables I.2 and I.3, it seems that the binary data resembles 

that of the equivalent ternary. It is interesting to note that the equimolar (x = 0.5) mixture 

of n-eicosane and n-tetracosane presents surface tension values quite close to those of pure 

n-docosane, although systematically lower. A study on several other pure, binary and 

ternary data from different sources (Jasper et al.,1953; McLure et al. 1982; Jasper, 1972; 

Koefoed et al. 1958; Águila-Hernandez, 1987; Jasper et al., 1955; Grigoryev et al., 1992; 

Pandey et al., 1982; Pugachevich et al. 1980) showed that for n-alkanes with the same 

average chain length, surface tension slightly decreases with the increase on the number of 

components, as observed in this work.

Liquid-liquid water – n-alkane interfacial tension data are presented in Table I. 4 and 

compared with literature values from Zeppieri et al. (2001) in Figure I. 8. As for the  

liquid-vapor interfacial tensions, small deviations are observed, with an average absolute 

deviation (Eq. I.7) for water-n-heptane and water-n-decane of 0.3 %. For the systems with 

n-eicosane, n-docosane and n-tetracosane no literature data was found. 

In Table I. 5 some vapor-liquid interfacial tensions of petroleum distillation cuts 

(503.15 K – 648.15 K) from crudes of different sources (North Sea, Africa and Middle 

East) obtained from the Petrogal1 refinery are presented. These were chosen since they are 

the basis for the diesels produced at the refinery and cover the range of n-alkane contents 

typically found there (3 to 30 wt %). The characterization of these fractions can be found at 

section I.2.4.

I.2.2. Viscosity 

 

A rolling ball microviscometer from Anton PAAR KG (AMV 200 Automated 

Microviscometer) was used. This apparatus is based on the measurement of the time that a 

steel ball needs to roll down inside a glass capillary filled with sample, Figure I. 9. 

Figure I. 9: AMV 200 Anton Paar automated microviscometer. Right: detail of the working 
principle (Dandekar et. al., 1998) 

 

Several combinations of ball(A)/capillary(C) of different diameters can be selected, 

giving the possibility of measuring viscosities from 0.5 to 800 mPa·s. One of the 

advantages of this technique is that it requires very small amounts of sample (B). 

Depending on the capillary, only 0.12 to 2.5 cm3 are used. For the measurements reported 

in this section, a glass capillary of 1.6 mm diameter and gold balls of 1.500 mm diameter 

were used. The measurement is fully automatic. Two magnetic sensors (F) are used to 

determine the rolling time which is reported within ± 0.01 s. Shear stress can be varied by 

selecting different rolling angles, and up to ten different rolling angles (both positive and 

negative) can be chosen from 15º to 90º. Up to six repetitions can be programmed for each 

angle. 



Part I: Experimental 

- 28 - 

The viscosity is calculated from the rolling times and the liquid density using the 

following equation: 

 

( )liquidballt ????? ?= )(         (I. 8) 

 

where ? is the viscosity, mPa·s, ? is a calibration constant which only depends on the 

angle ?, t is the roll time, s, and ? is the density, Kg·m-3. Density values to be used with 

Eq. I.8 are reported in section I.2.3. 

The parameter ? is only angle-dependent and has to be determined, for each angle ?, 

with liquids of known viscosity and density. Distilled water, Cannon Instruments Co. and 

HAAKE Medingen Gmbh viscosity standards were used for calibration. These standards 

were selected so that the entire measuring range was covered. 

Temperature was controlled in the viscometer by the use of a Heto thermostatic 

circulator. A built-in temperature sensor (I), placed closed to the capillary surface, 

enclosed in a thermostatic capillary block (E) on whose walls the thermostatic water 

circulates (D), measured the temperature. The temperature working range for this 

instrument is 279.15 to 353.15 K with an uncertainty of ± 0.01 K. 

The following chemicals were used in the measurements: n-heptane  

(Rathburn, ?  99 wt. %), n-decane (Aldrich, ? 99 wt. %), n-hexadecane  

(Aldrich, ?  99 wt. %), n-eicosane (Aldrich, ?  99 wt. %), n-docosane  

(Fluka, ?  98 wt. %) and n-tetracosane (Fluka, ?  99 wt %). Liquid room-temperature n-

alkanes (n-heptane and n-decane) were dried over molecular sieves. No further purification 

was carried out. 

Mixtures (total mass of 10 g) were carefully prepared by weighing the components on 

a Sartorius analytical balance (± 0.0001 g). After preparation, solutions were kept in the 

refrigerator between measurements. 

Following the measurements, the viscometer capillary was carefully cleaned with 

toluene and ethanol and afterwards dried with vacuum. 



Experimental Methods, Results and Discussion 

- 29 - 

Viscosity was measured, at atmospheric pressure, from 293.15 K (or above the 

melting point) up to 343.15 K in temperature intervals of 10 K. A new ball was used for 

each measurement. 

The measured viscosities are reported in Tables I.6 – I.9. Each viscosity measurement 

was performed at 10 different rolling angles from 15.0º to 46.5º with four repetitions at 

each value. Each reported data point is thus an average of 40 different viscosity 

measurements. 

It should be noted that, for n-heptane, viscosity is only reported up to 323.2 K, since at 

the highest temperatures, considerable deviations were found against literature data. These 

measurements would also correspond to a measuring range substantially below the lower 

limit suggested by the viscometer manufacturer.

data is presented. Viscosity average absolute deviations (Eq. I.7) are below 5 % with the

maximum deviation found for n-tetracosane (4.7 %), for which only a small amount of 

experimental information is available (DIPPR, 1998; Wakefield et al., 1988). For the other 

n-alkanes deviations were the following: n-heptane, 1.7 %, n-decane, 3.2 %, n-hexadecane, 

1.6 %, n-eicosane, 2.0 %, with the average of all deviations being 2.1 %, quite close to the 

values found by Dandekar et al. (1998) for the same equipment. No viscosity data was 

found for n-docosane. A graphical comparison of the deviations observed for n-hexadecane 

is presented in Figure I. 10. 

Mixture results are reported on Tables I.7 – I.8. No literature data were found for any 

of the mixture points. 

With these results, viscosities of the ternaries n-C10H22 + n-C20H42 + n-C24H50 and  

n-C7H16 + n-C20H42 + n-C24H50 and those of the corresponding binaries (in terms of average 

chain length of the heavier components), n-C10H22 + n-C22H46 and C7H16 + n-C22H46, can be 

compared, as already done for the measured interfacial tensions.

As can be seen from Figures I.11 and I.12, viscosities of the binary mixtures tend to be 

higher than the equivalent ternary mixture, as seen before for the interfacial tensions  

(see I.2.1). Similar conclusions from experimental studies of binary and quaternary n-

alkane mixtures were reported by Wakefield et al. (1988).

The viscosities of the petroleum distillation cuts selected for this thesis are presented 

in Table I. 9. The characterization of these fractions can be found at section I.2.4.

I.2.3. Liquid Density 

 

Liquid density was determined in an Anton PAAR DMA 58 unit, based on the vibrating 

U-tube method. This equipment measures the oscillating period of an U-tube filled with 

sample that is automatically converted to liquid density after proper calibration. Two 

density standards have to be selected for calibration, at each temperature. In this work, air 

and distilled water were used as calibrating fluids. This instrument can operate from 

263.15 K up to 343.15 K, and it uses approximately 0.7 cm3 of sample, injected with a 

syringe. The temperature is kept constant with a built-in Peltier element that can control 

temperature in the cell within ± 0.005 K. The temperature is displayed with an accuracy of 

± 0.01 K and density values within ± 10-2 Kg·m-3 (Anton Paar, 1990). 

Figure I. 13: Anton Paar DMA 58 densimeter 

 

Following each measurement, the U-tube was carefully cleaned with toluene and 

ethanol. In the end it was dried with compressed air. 

The same pure components and mixtures used for the viscosity measurements as 

reported in I.2.3 were used for determining the liquid densities. 

In Table I. 10 a comparison of the measured densities with literature pure component 

data (DIPPR, 1998; Doutour et al., 2001b; Vargaftik, 1975; Doolittle et al., 1951; Cooper 

et al., 1991; Aralaguppi et al., 1999) is presented. As can be seen, liquid density average 

absolute deviations (Eq. I.7) are below 0.2 %, and the average of all deviations is 0.1 %.

In Figure I. 14, n-decane liquid densities are compared with other literature results. As 

can be observed, very good agreement with literature was obtained.

Mixture results are reported on Tables I.11 and I.12. No literature data were found for 

any of the reported mixture points. 

Again, as for the interfacial tensions and the viscosities, liquid densities of the 

ternaries n-C10H22 + n-C20H42 + n-C24H50 and n-C7H16 + n-C20H42 + n-C24H50 and those of 

the corresponding binaries (in terms of average chain length of the heavier components), n-

C10H22 + n-C22H46 and n-C7H16 + n-C22H46, can be compared (Figures I.15 and I.16).

I.2.4. Characterization of the Distillation Cuts 

 

This section deals with the characterization of five distillation cuts  

(503 K-648 K) from crudes of different sources (North Sea, Africa and Middle East) 

obtained from the Petrogal refinery. They were chosen because they are the basis for the 

diesels produced at the refinery and cover the range of n-alkane contents typically found 

there (3 to 30 wt. %). Precipitation curves for these cuts, showing the temperature 

dependence of the solid fraction, were measured by Differential Scanning Calorimetry 

(DSC) according to a method proposed before (Coutinho et al., 1997 and 2000b). n-alkane 

compositions were kindly determined at the Université de Pau et de Pays de L’Adour, 

France, by gas chromatography (GC), and the average molecular weight was estimated by 

freezing point depression. No attempt to obtain any further compositional information was 

done since, as will be discussed later (section III.5), the non n-alkane compounds do not 

play a relevant role in the low temperature behavior of these fluids. 

To measure the composition of the samples a Hewlett Packard 6890 chromatograph 

equipped with a hydrogen flame ionization detector was used. The column employed is 

composed by a pre-column of 1 m (ID = 530 µm); two 30 m columns, the first an HP 5 MS 

(ID = 320 µm and film thickness 0.5 µm) and the second a HP 5 (ID = 320 µm and film 

thickness 0.25 µm), and a final empty column of about 30 cm. The injection is performed 

on-column. On this chromatograph both the temperature and the carrier gas flow rate are 

programmable. To obtain a better separation of the heavy n-alkanes, the gas flow rate is 

kept at 2 cm3/min during the first 100 minutes and then increased to 3 cm3/min. The 

heating starts at 333 K, goes at 2.5 K/min up to 578 K, and then at 2 K/min up to 593 K. 

Under these conditions n-alkanes between n-decane (n-C10H22) and n-triacontane  

(n-C30H62) can be quantified. n-nonane (n-C9H20) (Aldrich, &gt;99 %) was used as reference 

and CS2 as solvent. A chromatogram for Oso condensate is shown in Figure I. 17. The 

compositions obtained are presented in Table I. 14.

Calorimetric measurements were performed on a Setaram DSC 141 differential 

scanning calorimeter. The sample was initially cooled to 130 K, kept at that temperature 

for 15 minutes to stabilize, and then heated up to 593 K at 3 K/min. This heating rate was 

chosen since it provides a good compromise between a good signal and to be close to 

equilibrium conditions. The wax appearance temperatures presented in Table I. 15 were 

measured under these conditions and may thus be slightly over estimated. The 

thermograms are presented in Figure I. 18. They are similar to other DSC measurements 

for fuels and crudes previously reported in the literature (Coutinho et al., 2000b; Létoffé et 

al., 1995; Bosselet et al., 1983).

Experimental Methods, Results and Discussion 

- 49 - 

After a glass transition at around 190 K, there was an exothermic peak due to the 

crystallization of species that did not crystallize on cooling. This was followed by a broad 

endotherm due to the dissolution of the paraffinic crystals in the liquid matrix. The major 

problem in the treatment of DSC results from these fluids is the definition of a base line. 

As proposed by Bosselet et al. (1983) and Létoffé et al. (1995) a polynomial line fitted to 

the liquid region and the basis of the exotherm, where the dissolution of the paraffins 

began, is used as base line. Since there is no way to assess the ‘true’ base line for these 

fluids this is a fair approach to it. Nevertheless, one must be aware that some uncertainty 

was introduced in the calculations by its adoption. Using this base line the fraction of 

solids dissolved is obtained using an approach proposed before were the fraction of melted 

n-alkanes was identified with the fraction of total energy required to completely melt the n-

alkanes obtained from the integration of the energy using the adjusted base line  

(Coutinho et al., 1997 and 2000b).

I.3. Conclusions 

 

Several experimental measurements were reported on vapor-liquid and liquid-liquid 

interfacial tensions, liquid densities and viscosities. Differential scanning calorimetry and 

gas chromatography were also used to characterize some petroleum distillation cuts which 

were selected to represent real hydrocarbon fluids containing heavier n-alkanes. 

Pure component data was used to evaluate the performance of the equipment. Special 

care was given to tensiometry, since the NIMA DST 9005 tensiometer was used for the first 

time during these measurements. For that, additional binary mixtures were considered in 

order to better check its accuracy. As shown during this chapter, vapor-liquid interfacial 

tension agreed with literature within 1.2 %, water-n-alkane interfacial tension within  

0.3 %, viscosity within 2.1 % and liquid density within 0.1 %. It can thus be concluded that 

the measurements were accurate, giving also some confidence about the results for new 

systems. 

Mixtures were selected in order to extend the available literature database. Particularly 

for those containing heavier n-alkanes and small chain length homologues (asymmetric 

mixtures) data were scarce. Seven binary and two ternary mixtures were thus selected for 

this purpose. Binary results were presented in the full composition range and at a set of 

temperatures starting from 293.15 K and ending at 343.13 K, the upper working limit of he 

employed densimeter. 

The measured properties from the ternary mixtures, n-C7H16 (or n-C10H22) + n-C20H42 

+ n-C24H50, were compared with those from the equivalent binaries, n-C7H16 or (n-C10H22) 

+ n-C22H46 using equimolar n-C20H42 and n-C24H50 in the preparation of the ternary 

mixtures. Results confirmed that although the corresponding liquid densities can be 

considered equal, viscosities and interfacial tensions of the ternaries tend to be lower than 

those from the binaries. 

Surface freezing, a phenomenon that has been found to occur in some heavier n-

alkanes and n-alcohols and that can be followed from tensiometry (Wu et al., 1993) was 

observed from the interfacial tension measurements. Thus, from this work it can be

concluded that the employed Nima tensiometer may also be used to investigate this phase 

transition. 

From the measurements reported in this chapter a considerable amount of data is now 

available for asymmetric and heavier n-alkane mixtures. These results were used to 

develop correlations and evaluate models for their estimation, as will be shown in Part II 

and Part III.

II.1. Introduction 

 

In this chapter a review of the available experimental critical properties and Pitzer 

acentric factors for n-alkanes, as well as an assessment of correlations for their estimation 

will be presented and discussed, since these are especially important for modeling 

purposes, particularly for corresponding states models, as will be later shown during  

Part III. 

In section II.3 interfacial tension and viscosity data are used to evaluate a linear 

relation between the natural logarithm of the vapor-liquid interfacial tension and the 

reciprocal viscosity, first proposed by Pelofsky (1966). The interest in these relations 

follows from the possibility of obtaining one of these properties from measurements on the 

other, thus overcoming data deficiency. These relations can also be used to test the validity 

of measured data, since deviations can be ascribed to experimental errors. 

It will be shown that this relation holds for both pure and mixed n-alkanes. Since most 

of the available data is from the lowest members of the series and following the purposes 

of this thesis, results will be mostly focused on the heavier members and some of their 

mixtures with lighter components (asymmetric mixtures). Results for the petroleum 

distillation cuts presented on the previous chapter, will also be discussed.

In this section, a literature review on the available experimental critical temperatures 

pressures and volumes and the Pitzer acentric factor for n-alkanes is presented and 

discussed. 

Given the lack of data for the heavier components, correlations for their estimation 

will be assessed and selected, since critical properties are required for the correct 

modeling of these molecules. 

 

II.2. Critical Properties and Acentric Factors 

 

Properties such as critical temperatures, critical pressures, critical volumes and Pitzer 

acentric factors are frequently required as input data for many models. For example, 

corresponding states models and equations of state rely on these pure component properties 

for their accurate modeling results. In this section, an overview of the available 

experimental data for n-alkanes and an evaluation of some correlations for their prediction 

are presented. 

A good selection of correlations is particularly important for the heavier n-alkanes for 

which no experimental information is available. 



Part II: Data Correlation 

- 60 - 

Several works on literature reported critical properties for the n-alkane series  

(Ambrose et al., 1995; Anselme, 1990; Magoulas et al., 1990; Nikitin et al., 1997;  

Teja et al., 1990; Tsonopoulos, 1987). Ambrose et al. (1995) performed a literature review 

and presented values for all the n-alkanes ranging from methane up to n-tetracosane  

(n-C24H50). Above n-tetracosane, Nikitin et al. (1997) reported values for n-C26H54, n-

C28H58, n-C30H62 and n-C36H74. 

These values, reported by Ambrose (1995) and Nikitin et al. (1997), are presented in 

Table II. 1 and were used to assess the available correlations for the estimation of long 

chain n-alkanes. 

For the acentric factors, Magoulas et al. (1990) presented values from methane up to 

n-eicosane. These are also reported in Table II. 1.

Critical Properties and Acentric Factors

Critical temperature 

To estimate the critical temperatures of heavier n-alkanes, correlations were collected 

from different sources (Ambrose, 1978 and 1979; Constantinou et al., 1994;  

Hu et al., 1993; Joback et al., 1987; Kontogeorgis et al., 1997; Lydersen, 1955;  

Marano et al., 1997a and 1997b; Marrero-Morejón et al., 1999; Nakanishi et al., 1960; 

Nikitin et al., 1997; Robinson, 1987; Teja et al., 1990 and Tsonopoulos, 1987). 

From all the selected correlations, that from Tsonopoulos (1987), to be used above  

n-C3H8, was found to be the best for describing the experimental critical temperatures  

(up to n-C36H74), although it was derived when only data up to n-C18H38 was available:

Critical pressure 

For the estimation of critical pressures, correlations were collected from  

Kontogeorgis et al., 1997; Marano et al., 1997a and 1997b; Teja et al., 1990;  

Tsonopoulos, 1987; Marrero-Morejón et al., 1999; Hu et al., 1993; Lydersen, 1955;

Nakanishi et al., 1960; Nikitin et al., 1997; Magoulas et al., 1990 and Morgan et al., 1991. 

This time, the correlation from Magoulas et al. (1990), showed the better results for 

the available heavier component data, while maintaining also a good description for the 

lighter n-alkanes (Figure II. 2):

Critical Properties and Acentric Factors

Critical volume 

Critical volumes are difficult to measure with precision and so their experimental 

information are also scarce, as can be seen from Table II. 1, where the heaviest n-alkane 

for which there is available data is n-C18H38. 

Correlations for the estimation of critical volumes have been proposed by several 

researchers (Ambrose, 1979; Anselme et al., 1990; Constantinou et al., 1994;  

Joback et al., 1987; Lydersen, 1955; Marano et al., 1997a; Marrero-Morejón et al., 1999; 

Teja et al., 1990; Tsonopoulos, 1987). 

Figure II. 3  n-alkane critical density. Experimental and correlation results with the  
Marano et al. (1997a) correlation. 

 

A good review of some of these correlations can be found in literature  

(Kontogeorgis et al.,1995) where the variation of the critical density with the molecular 

weight was also discussed based on the available sets of experimental data and some 

calculations using the Rackett equation (Rackett, 1970). Kontogeorgis et al.(1995) 

concluded that the critical density of an homologous series should decrease with the 

molecular weight, after passing through a maximum at low molecular weights. A plot of

the experimental n-alkane critical densities as a function of molecular weight is presented 

in Figure II. 3. 

To correlate this property, the Marano et al. (1997a), the Anselme et al (1990) and the 

Teja et al. (1990) correlations presented very similar performance. For the purposes of this 

work, the Marano et al. (1997a) correlation was selected, since it described better the 

heavier n-alkane critical densities:

Pitzer acentric factor 

Pitzer acentric factors (Pitzer et al., 1955), defined by Eq. II.4, where p stands for 

pressure, Tr for reduced temperature (T/Tc) and subscript c for critical property can be 

calculated by several correlations (Constantinou et al., 1994; Han et al., 1993;  

Hoshino et al., 1982; Kontogeorgis et al., 1997; Magoulas et al., 1990;

From these, the group-contribution correlation presented by Han et al. (1993) gave the

The experimental values reported in Table II. 1 and the selected correlations for the 

critical temperature, critical pressure, critical volume and the Pitzer acentric factor 

presented in this section will be used during Part III for modeling purposes. Particularly for 

corresponding states models, as will be shown in section III.2, the right description of these 

properties is especially important.

Plots of different data sets verify that the natural logarithm of the vapor-liquid 

interfacial tension is linear with the reciprocal viscosity, with slope dependent on the 

molecular weight and constant intercept for average chain lengths greater than n-C10H22. 

For these, the value of the intercept can be related to the interfacial tension at the 

temperature of homogeneous nucleation, where the reciprocal viscosity tends to zero. 

With this relation only a viscosity (or interfacial tension) value is required to calculate 

an interfacial tension (or viscosity) point. 

The presented results show how bulk transport and equilibrium interface properties 

can be interrelated. 

 

II.3. Interfacial Tension - Viscosity Relations 

 

Following several attempts to relate vapor-liquid interfacial tension with viscosity, 

Pelofsky (1966) presented a linear relation between these two thermophysical properties: 

 

?
?

B
A += lnln          (II. 6) 

 



Part II: Data Correlation 

- 68 - 

where A and B are constants, ? is the interfacial tension, and ? the viscosity. 

According to Pelofsky (1966), this empirical relation can be applied for both organic and 

inorganic liquid phases of pure and mixed components. Several fluids were shown to 

follow these relations: n-alkanes in the range n-C2H6 - n-C6H14, benzene, toluene, xylenes, 

phenol and other aromatics, n-alcohols in the range CH3OH – n-C4H9OH, ketones, water 

and some aqueous solutions. 

Latter, Schonhorn (1967) introduced a correction in the second term of the right-hand 

side of Eq. II.6 to fulfill the requirement that at the critical point interfacial goes to zero, 

while viscosity tends to a small, but constant value: 

 

vl

B
A

??
?

?
+= lnln         (II. 7) 

 

where subscripts l and v stand for the liquid and vapor phase, respectively. This 

relation was successfully applied by Schonhorn (1967) for pure metals like sodium and 

potassium, salts such as KBr, NaBr and NaCl, n-decane, argon, benzene, water, CCl4 and 

polyethylene. 

In his work, Schonhorn (1967) related ln A with ?N, the interfacial tension at TN, the 

temperature of homogeneous nucleation, that is, the temperature were clusters start to form 

spontaneously. At this temperature, the reciprocal viscosity tends to zero and thus, ? = A. 

Both in the works from Pelofsky (1966) and Shonhorn (1967) no physical meaning has 

been given to the slope, B, although Pelofsky has used a functional of the molecular weight 

to correlate this constant for members of the same family. 

Following the work from Pelofsky (1966), later re-evaluated by Schonhorn (1967) and 

Pedersen et al. (1989), several pure and mixed n-alkanes were assessed. Since most of the 

available data has been taken far from the critical point, where the vapor phase viscosity is 

small compared to that of the liquid phase, we can drop the correction introduced in  

Eq. II.7 and use Pelofsky’s approach (Eq. II.6). With this approach, although an incorrect 

description of the interfacial tension is obtained close to the critical point, no need for 

information on the vapor phase viscosity is required, and the formalism of Eq. II.6 can be

kept very simple and accurate, far from the critical point, while using a minimum amount 

of experimental data. 

 

Pure components 

The data reported in Part I together with other pure component data  

(DIPPR, 1998; Vargaftik, 1975) was used for the purposes of this section. Since the 

literature information for interfacial tension is considerably smaller than that available for 

viscosity, interfacial tension limited the temperature range of this study. For the same 

reason, no pressure effect was considered at this point. 

In Figure II. 5, the linear relation (Eq. II.6) is verified for some of the studied  

n-alkanes: n-C6H14 up to n-C20H42. The same trend below n-hexane was also verified in 

this work and has already been shown by Pelofsky (1966). In these plots, only two points 

in 163 happened to be outside the linear relation, but these were also found to be outliers in 

the interfacial tension or viscosity plots as a function of temperature. Thus, if a set of 

values is found to be away from the linear plot, that may indicate incorrect viscosity or 

interfacial tension measurements.

As can be seen from Figure II. 5 and Table II. 2, ln A tends to a value close to 3.41 as 

the chain length of the n-alkane increases. This corresponds, in Figure II. 6, to a value of 

?N = A of 30.2 mN.m
-1, which agrees quite closely with 31.6 mN.m-1, reported by 

Shonhorn (1967) for polyethylene. Below n-decane the values of ln A (and ??) seem to 

vary linearly with the chain length. The exception is methane, which although following 

Eq. II.6, present values that significantly deviate from linearity in Figure II. 6. For the other 

lower n-alkanes, up to n-C9H20, the following correlation can be used to obtain the value of 

ln A: 

 

n02240.0631.3Aln ×?=        (II. 8) 

 

where n is the chain length of the n-alkane, CnH2n+2. If, instead, the molecular weight 

(MW/g.mol-1) is used in the correlation, the following relation results:

Figure II. 6:  Plots of A as a function of the n-alkane chain length. 

 

From the intercept values reported in Table II. 2, and considering that for n-alkanes 

with chain length above n-C4H10 the viscosity term (B/?) in Eq.II.6 can be neglected close 

to the melting point, temperatures corresponding to these interfacial tensions (?N) were 

calculated using correlations of experimental interfacial tension data as a function of 

temperature. These temperatures are reported on Table II. 2 under the calc. TN column. If 

compared with literature melting points (Dirand et al., 2002) it can be recognized that these 

values fall systematically below the melting temperatures, with values of reduced 

undercooling, 05.0T/)TT(T meltNmeltr ??=?  that agree with those known for the  

n-alkanes (Herhold et al., 1999). It can thus be concluded, following Schonhorn (1967), 

that the value of A corresponds to the interfacial tension of the fluid at the temperature of 

homogeneous nucleation (TN), and that this is constant for chain lengths higher than  

n-C10H22.

For the slopes, the same separation seems appropriate, as can be seen from  

Figure II. 7. Below n-decane one linear trend can be assumed, where methane is again not

variable in these relations, reducing its predictive ability, in this section, only the molecular 

weight of the n-alkane was used to correlate this parameter. The interest in using the 

molecular weight as a correlating variable, follows from the possibility of applying this 

relation to more complex systems, for which compositional analysis are difficult to obtain 

and properties other than the molecular weight, boiling point or specific gravity, may be 

inaccessible as is the case for most of the petroleum fluids. 

 

Synthetic mixtures 

Following the results presented for the pure components, Eq. II.6 was also evaluated

Figure II. 8 plots of ln ? as a function of 1/? for the mixture n-C10H22 + n-C20H42 are

All these mixtures have average chain lengths, ( ? ×= ii nxn ) above 10, so from the 

previous conclusions for the pure components, they may have the same intercept. In fact, 

from Table II. 3 one can check that the values of ln A fall within a very short interval 

[3.37-3.44], with an average of 3.41, the same established previously for the pure 

components. Thus, in terms of intercept, a constant value of 3.41 applies also for mixtures 

with n ?  10. This can be confirmed in Figure II. 9 were A is plotted as a function of the 

average chain length for the mixtures reported on Table II. 3.

To verify that the slopes can also be calculated using the same equations as for the 

pure fluids, Figure II. 10 was plotted using the B values reported on Table II. 3. A least-

squares fit for the best linear equation gave a slope of 310629.1 ?×? , which agrees within 

6.6 % with 310508.1 ?×? , reported on Eq. II.13. Considering the dispersion of values on 

Figure II. 10, Eq. II.13 was considered to be also valid for mixtures. To check this 

assumption, Eq. II.12 together with ln A= 3.41 were used in Eq. II.6 to estimate interfacial

Results are reported on Table II. 4. 

Figure II. 10:  Plots of B for n-alkane mixtures as a function of average molecular weight. 

 

As can be seen from Table II. 4, very good interfacial tension estimation is obtained 

with the maximum average deviations found for the most asymmetric mixtures. The same 

trend was found for the estimated viscosities, but higher deviations are observed, ranging 

from 5 % up to 29 % with an average of 13 %. It can thus be concluded that for the studied 

n-alkane mixtures, Eq. II.6 returns better estimates of interfacial tension from viscosity, 

than viscosity estimates from interfacial tension. 

The results obtained for the interfacial tension opened the opportunity to estimate this 

property at high pressure, where the available experimental data are scarce and 

measurements more difficult to perform. For that, high pressure viscosity, which can be 

more easily found in literature, is required.

distillation cuts presented in this work, no PNA distribution was determined, and thus, the 

evaluation of this model for the reported distillation cuts is not possible.

II.4. Conclusions 

 

A review on the available n-alkane experimental critical properties and Pitzer acentric 

factors was presented. For components above n-C36H74 no literature data was found, while 

for the critical volumes, experimental values have only be reported up to n-C18H38. 

Correlations for the estimation of the heavier n-alkane properties are particularly 

important, since they are required for the correct modeling of thermophysical properties 

and phase equilibria. Several correlations were assessed and the Tsonopoulos (1987), 

Magoulas et al. (1990), Marano et al. (1997a) and the Han et al. (1993) correlations were 

found to be the most accurate at describing, respectively, critical temperatures, critical 

pressures, critical volumes and acentric factors. 

A linear relation between the natural logarithm of the vapor-liquid interfacial tension 

and the reciprocal viscosity was found to be valid for pure n-alkanes, some of their binary 

and ternary mixtures and petroleum distillation cuts of different n-alkane content. 

The intercept can be linked with the interfacial tension at the temperature of 

homogeneous nucleation, where the reciprocal viscosity approaches zero. For n-alkanes 

with chain length higher than n-C10H22 this value is constant. Below n-C10H22, a linear 

correlation can be used for its calculation. 

For the slope, two correlations where proposed: one for fluids with chain length higher 

than n-C10H22, and other for fluids with chain length smaller than n-C10H22. Methane is not 

included in any of the proposed correlations, since its behavior falls outside that observed 

for the other n-alkanes. 

Some heavier and asymmetric n-alkane mixtures reported in the previous chapter of 

this thesis were evaluated for the extension of the proposed linear relation to mixtures. 

Linearity was again observed, and interestingly, intercepts equal to those of the same chain 

length pure components were found. The same happened with the slopes that could be 

calculated from an equation obtained for the pure components. Using the equivalent pure 

component slopes and intercepts, very good interfacial tension estimates where obtained 

from viscosity data. If viscosity is to be obtained from interfacial tension larger errors shall 

be expected.

Finally, some petroleum distillation cuts of different origins where also shown to 

follow the presented linear relation, but, as expected, the correlating equations presented 

before where not applicable, since these contain components other than n-alkanes. For 

these fluids, composition dependent correlations are required.

 III.1. Introduction 

 

Accurate values of thermophysical properties are essential for the correct process and 

product design. Frequently, the desired properties at the required temperature, pressure and 

composition conditions may not yet have been determined experimentally, and so, either 

an experimental determination must be carried out or an adequate model should be 

selected. 

Regularly, models are used, as experimental measurements are expensive and time 

consuming, and the desired accuracies for the required properties may not be very 

restrictive. 

There is a considerable number of models for the estimation of each thermophysical 

property (Poling et al., 2000). These models can be classified as theoretical, empirical or 

semi-empirical. The first are usually the more general and can be applied for new systems, 

but they often present large deviations and can only be used for qualitative purposes. 

Empirical models can be highly accurate, since some of its parameters are regressed from 

experimental data, but these are less theoretically sound and extrapolations for new 

systems and regions outside the fitted area must be done with caution. Semi-empirical 

models are usually the best solution, since they combine a theoretical formalism with some 

parameter estimation from available experimental data. In any case, it is very important to 

evaluate a model against a small set of experimental data for similar systems, before we 

select that model for our particular purposes. In this chapter, with the new data from 



Part III: Modeling 

- 84 - 

section I.2, model evaluation will be carried out in order to check their application for the 

new heavier and asymmetric n-alkane mixtures. 

No attempt to extensively evaluate literature models for the systems presented on this 

thesis was made, as some general reviews can be found on literature (Poling et al., 2000) 

and this would, most certainly, lead to the selection of different models for each 

thermophysical property. Instead, the focus was on the selection of generalized models that 

could be simultaneously used for more than one property such as corresponding states and 

equations of state based models such as the friction theory for viscosity and liquid density 

and the gradient theory of fluid interfaces than can be used to simultaneously model phase 

equilibrium, interfacial tensions and density profiles. 

Some of the most accurate models, although mathematically simple and using a small 

amount of experimental information, are those based on the corresponding states principle. 

One of the advantages of corresponding states models is that the same formalism can be 

used for different properties, where the only changes are the definition of the reduced 

property and the equation used for the reference system or the reference system itself. 

Since these models do not use any experimental data of the estimating property of the 

target fluid, they are also predictive. The only experimental information required from the 

target fluid are the critical properties and the Pitzer acentric factor. The coupling between 

the strong theoretical basis behind the corresponding states principle and the accuracy of 

the empirical equations used to describe the reference system justify the effort in 

developing such models. 

Corresponding states models have been successfully used for the estimation of 

properties of pure components and mixtures, mainly for nonpolar and small molecules, 

although some effort has also been made at extending them to polar fluids and their 

mixtures (Marrucho, 1996; Marrucho et al., 1998). This chapter presents the extension of 

these models for the evaluation of thermophysical properties of long chain molecules in a 

broad temperature range, based on information from lower members of the same 

homologous series. A new model is presented and evaluated for the prediction of the liquid 

densities, viscosities and vapor-liquid interfacial tensions presented in Part I. It will also be 

shown that this model may improve the estimation of other properties such as vapor 

pressures, thermal conductivities and speeds of sound. Using the same framework, this 



Introduction 

- 85 - 

model can be used to predict all these properties in a broad temperature range and for both 

lighter and heavier n-alkanes and their mixtures. 

The gradient theory of fluid interfaces and the friction theory are state-of-the-art 

models, with the most interesting developments reported in the last five years  

(Cornelisse et al., 1996; Cornelisse, 1997; Kahl et al., 2000 and 2002; Miqueu, 2001; 

Miqueu et al., 2003 and 2004; Quinõnes-Cisneros et al., 2000, 2001a and 2001b;  

Zéberg-Mikkelsen et al., 2001 and 2002; Zuo et al., 1996, 1997b and 1998). Some results 

from these models will be presented and discussed during sections III.3 and II.4, 

respectively. 

Aiming at describe the water-hydrocarbon liquid-liquid interfaces, the gradient theory 

was coupled with the Cubic-Plus-Association (CPA) equation of state, a thermodynamic 

model that has shown to be able to describe vapor-liquid and liquid-liquid equilibria of 

mixtures containing water, alkanes and alcohols (Derawi, 2002; Kontogeorgis et al., 1996 

and 1999; Voutsas, 2000; Wu et al., 1998; Yakoumis et al., 1998). Particularly for  

water-alkane systems, CPA is actually the only model that provides acceptable results for 

both the solubility of water in the hydrocarbon-phase and the hydrocarbon solubility in the 

aqueous phase, thus presenting a great potential for the correct modeling of water-

hydrocarbon liquid-liquid interfaces. 

Finally, during section III.5 solid-liquid equilibria will be considered, as heavier  

n-alkanes are solid at ambient conditions. Accurate modeling of this kind of mixtures has 

already been reported (Coutinho, 1995 and 1998; Coutinho et al., 1995 and 1996), so in 

this chapter, data from the petroleum distillation cuts presented in chapter I will be used for 

checking model performance for real systems. The measured precipitation curves are 

compared with the predictions using the compositional analysis presented before. The 

selected model, which only requires the n-alkane composition, agrees well with the 

experimental data indicating that it can be an adequate tool to predict the low temperature 

behavior of hydrocarbon mixtures. No need for other mixture information, as usually 

required with other models is necessary.

Using the new measurements reported on Part I and other data collected from the 

literature along with the critical properties and acentric factors selected on Part II, the 

Corresponding States Principle was assessed for the modeling of some thermophysical 

properties of pure and mixed n-alkanes. 

A new corresponding states model is proposed. When using a generalized combining 

rule for the critical temperature, mixture data can be described with deviations within the 

experimental uncertainty of the measurements. 

 

III.2. The Corresponding States Principle 

 

III.2.1. Pure Fluids 

 

The application of corresponding states models extends from equilibrium properties 

such as vapor pressure (Morgan et al., 1994; Pitzer et al., 1955; Poling et al., 2000;  

Teja et al., 1981b; Xiang, 2002), liquid density (Muñoz et al., 1983; Poling et al., 2000; 

Teja et al., 1981b; Teja, 1980) or surface tension (Poling et al., 2000; Queimada et al., 

2001b; Rice et al., 1982; Zuo et al., 1997a) to transport properties such as viscosity  

(Ely et al., 1981; Klein et al., 1997; Lee et al., 1993; Poling et al., 2000;  

Teja et al., 1981a) and thermal conductivity (Poling et al., 2000). In spite of this versatility, 

the small amount of experimental information required and its mathematical simplicity,

corresponding states models can produce very accurate estimates of thermophysical 

properties, in broad temperature and pressure conditions. If we still add the strong 

theoretical basis behind the corresponding states principle we can justify any effort in 

studying and developing such models. 

The corresponding states principle was initially proposed by van der Walls who 

observed that the reduced version of his equation of state could be written for several 

fluids. Although the establishment of this principle was originally made only on an 

empirical basis, following studies in statistical mechanics and kinetic theory have 

confirmed its theoretical foundations (Ely et al., 2000; Guggenheim, 1945; Leland et al., 

1968; Pitzer, 1939; Reed et al.,1973; Rowlinson et al., 1982). Today, many generalized 

equations of state are examples of applications of this principle. 

The basic concept of corresponding states principle is to apply dimensional analysis to 

the configurational portion of the statistical mechanical partition function. The end result 

of this analysis is the expression of residual thermodynamic properties in terms of 

dimensionless groups. 

In its original form, the corresponding states principle, as proposed by van der Waals, 

expressed the reduced compressibility factor (Zr) in terms of a universal function of two 

parameters, the dimensionless temperature (Tr) and molar volume (Vr) (or pressure, pr):

Where Z is the compressibility factor, pV/RT, and the subscripts r and c stand for 

reduced and critical property and j and 0 for target and spherical reference fluid, 

respectively. 

Experimental evidence has, however, shown that this two-parameter corresponding 

states approach was limited to the noble gases and nearly spherical molecules such as 

nitrogen, oxygen and methane. To extend this theory to a broader range of fluids, 



The Corresponding States Principle 

- 89 - 

additional characterization parameters have been introduced to account for the  

non-conformalities. Two main approaches have been applied in this parameterization: the 

first performs a multi-parameter Taylor’s series expansion of the property of interest about 

the parameters; the second approach is to extend the simple two-parameter corresponding 

states principle at its molecular origin. This is accomplished by making the intermolecular 

potential parameters functions of the additional characterization parameters and the 

thermodynamic state, e.g. the temperature. The end result is a corresponding states model 

that has the same mathematical form as the simple two-parameter model, but the 

definitions of the dimensionless volume and temperature are more complex, involving the 

so-called shape factors (Ely et al., 2000). These models have been referred as the  

Extended Corresponding States Theory (ECST). 

 

Taylor series expansion 

An additional third parameter, the Pitzer acentric factor, ?, was introduced  

(Pitzer et al., 1955) to generalize the scope of the corresponding states principle including 

fluids whose force fields slightly depart from those of the original spherical symmetry. 

Reduced pressure was used instead of reduced volume due to the uncertainty usually 

ascribed to the measurement of critical volumes. A Taylor series expansion of the property 

of interest is performed about this third parameter, with the series being usually truncated 

beyond the first derivative: 

 

( ) ( ) ( )rrrrr0rrrrj p,TZp,TZ,p,TZ ?+=?      (III. 3) 

 

where Zro has the same meaning as in Eq. III.1 and Zr is a function that represents the 

departure from the spherical symmetry, the derivative ??? /Z . In spite of the analytic 

formalism of Eq. III.3, values for the functions Zr0 and Zr were only presented in tabular 

form by Pitzer and co-workers. 

With the advent of cheaper and faster computers, Lee et al. (1975) suggested replacing 

the derivative in the Taylor series with its finite difference:

with subscript 1 representing a non-spherical reference fluid (? &gt; 0). 

Although this new formalism contained a correction for the departure from the 

spherical symmetry, some problems arose in the description of polar or asymmetric 

systems. Since Eq. III.4 still contains a spherical reference fluid, (? = 0), large 

interpolations/extrapolations were frequent in the description of real fluids. Another 

problem was related with the widespread use of methane as the spherical reference fluid. 

Since methane has a triple point relatively high compared with the majority of the 

hydrocarbons, some low temperature calculations would result in the extrapolation of the 

methane equation of state introducing considerable errors in the predicted data. 

Following Teja and coworkers (Plöcker et al., 1978; Rice et al., 1982;  

Teja et al., 1981a and 1981b; Teja, 1980; Wong et al., 1983; Zuo et al., 1997a) the 

spherical reference in Eq. III.4 was abandoned. Therefore, both reference fluids could be 

similar to the evaluating fluid, reducing the errors due to large 

interpolations/extrapolations. Several thermophysical properties were estimated according 

to this new framework with very good predictive results:

where Xr stands for the reduced property to be evaluated and subscripts 1 and 2 for the 

two reference fluid properties at the same reduced conditions as those of the target fluid. In 

all cases, good agreement with experimental data was obtained in the range of fluids 

covered by the two references. However, considerable deviations can be found if the 

reference fluids are far apart in the series from the target fluid, either interpolating or 

extrapolating (Figures III.1-III.6). In an attempt to correct for these deviations, and based 

on the dependence of the desired properties with ? (or chain length) presented on

A third reference fluid is introduced with the advantage that no change in the reference 

system has to be done if one wants to study a large range of fluids or an asymmetric 

mixture. If instead, the Teja approach (Eq. III.5) is adopted for asymmetric mixtures with a 

single reference system, considerable deviations resulting from the 

interpolations/extrapolations may be found as will be latter shown. 

A quadratic dependence on the acentric factor for heavy alkanes (up to n-C28H58) was 

previously used with success by Morgan et al. (1994) to correlate vapor pressures and 

heats of vaporization. 

The linear Teja approach (Eq. III.5) and the new 2nd order perturbation model 

(Eq.III.6) were evaluated for saturated liquid density, liquid-vapor interfacial tension and 

viscosity of pure n-alkanes from methane up to n-hexatriacontane (n-C36H74), and some of 

their mixtures. Some results will also be presented for reduced vapor pressures, thermal 

conductivities and speeds of sound to show how this model can be used to improve the 

prediction of other thermophysical properties of the n-alkane series (Figures III.1 – III.6). 

Special care has been taken regarding the selection of the interfacial tension data since 

the values very often differ considerably from author to author (Calado et al., 1978; 

Grigoryev et al., 1992; Hunten et al., 1929; Jasper, 1972; Jasper et al., 1953 and 1955; 

Katz et al., 1939; Leadbetter et al., 1964; Mass et al., 1921; McLure et al., 1982;  

Miqueu et al., 2000; Wu, 1999). The data reported by Jasper (1972),  

Jasper et al. (1955, 1953) and by Grigoryev et al (1992) were used preferentially. The 

latter article covers all the liquid region of n-alkanes between n-C5H12 and n-C8H18.

Eq.III.8 was used to correlate the experimental liquid-vapor interfacial tension of the 

reference fluids, thus yielding two parameters per each fluid:

For vapor pressures, viscosities, liquid densities and thermal conductivities the 

experimental information presented on the DIPPR database (1998) was selected. The 

reported correlations were used when reliable and enough experimental information was 

available. For some of the components, the correlating parameters were refitted to assure a 

better data description in the full range of temperatures used in this study:

In the following of this section, results will be concentrated on vapor pressures, liquid 

densities, viscosities, and liquid-vapor interfacial tensions. Table III. 1 presents the studied 

n-alkanes for each property. 

In order to compare the linear perturbation model (Eq. III.5) with the new second 

order perturbation model (Eq, III.6), a collection of reduced temperatures covering a broad 

range of the liquid region was selected for evaluation, starting at Tr=0.45, close to the triple 

point of methane, and ending at Tr=0.75. The higher limit for the reduced temperature was 

established to avoid the extrapolation to higher temperatures of the correlating equations.

where Tc ,Vc and MW are, respectively, the critical temperature (K), critical volume 

(cm3·mol-1), and molecular weight (g·mol-1). Another reducing equation for viscosity, 

involving the critical pressure instead of the critical volume, can also be used  

(Ely et al., 1981; Lee et al., 1993), but our studies showed that it did not improve the 

results. 

The literature also displays diverse ways to reduce interfacial tension:  

Rice et al. (1982) used the critical volume and critical temperature (as in Eq. III.16), while 

Zuo et al. (1996) and Brock et al. (1955) used the critical pressure and critical temperature, 

respectively Eqs. III.17 and III.18.

and the natural logarithm of pr was taken as Xr in Eqs. III.5-III.7. 

Experimental critical properties were collected from the literature, as presented in 

Table II. 1. Correlations were considered for those n-alkanes for which there were no 

experimental information. Critical temperature was calculated from the correlation of 

Tsonopoulos (1987), critical pressure from that of Magoulas et al. (1990), critical volume 

from Marano et al. (1997a) and the Pitzer acentric factor from Han et al. (1993), as 

discussed during Part II. 

Although it would be theoretically possible to choose the same reference system to 

evaluate all properties, a small error in one or more of the reference fluids could mislead 

the results. Because of that, and in order to compare Eqs. III.5 and III.6, reference systems 

were selected for each property and model, so the smallest overall deviation was obtained. 

These reference systems are presented in Table III. 2 and the corresponding correlating 

coefficients to be used with Eqs. III.8-III.11 are reported in Table III. 3.

It should be noted that with the 2nd order perturbation model (Eq. III.6) methane can 

be used as the first reference fluid while the choice of a heavier member is required for the 

Teja approach (Eq. III.5). Basically, the 2nd order perturbation uses a lighter, an 

intermediate and a heavier member to represent the entire series. 

Figures III.1-III.4, showing the reduced properties as a function of the acentric factor 

at a reduced temperature of 0.5, clearly evidence that the linear perturbation cannot 

describe the behavior of the heavier n-alkanes, with the introduction of the second order 

term as in Eq. III.6 being required for an adequate description of these properties. 

Results are presented in Table III. 4 and Figures III.7 – III.12 as a function of reduced 

temperature. This table shows how the introduction of the second order term of the Taylor 

series expansion improves the prediction of the reduced properties at all the studied

reduced temperatures. The average improvements over the linear approach are 32% for 

liquid density, 33% for vapor pressure and 56% for viscosity. Interfacial tension results are 

not presented in this table, since for most of the n-alkanes for which there are experimental 

data, only a narrow temperature range was available. Above n-C16H34, data was only found 

up to Tr = 0.55.

Some trends in the deviations with reduced temperature reported in Table III. 4 can be 

ascribed to uncertainties propagating from the experimental measurements to the reference 

fluid correlating equations. Measurements at higher temperatures are typically more 

uncertain, and properties such as vapor pressure and viscosity often present greater 

uncertainty at low temperatures due to the difficulties in measuring smaller vapor pressures 

and the sharp increase of viscosity with the proximity of the melting point. 

Figures III.7 – III.12 illustrate the percent average deviation of the estimated reduced 

properties, with respect to the experimental value, as a function of the chain length of the 

n-alkane. It can be seen that the linear approach proposed by Teja and co-workers has 

some limitations for the heavier n-alkanes and that the average deviation decreases 

considerably around the reference fluid, confirming that this model is not able to predict 

the trend in the reduced property, as shown before on Figures III.1 – III.4. 



The Corresponding States Principle 

- 101 - 

In both models the highest deviations are found for the lowest and highest reduced 

temperatures, except for viscosity where the highest deviations are mainly from the lowest 

reduced temperatures. As mentioned before, this should be the result of the higher 

uncertainties in the corresponding experimental measurements, coupled with the smaller 

amount of data usually found in these regions that can make the correlating equations less 

accurate in these zones. 

The 2nd order perturbation model shows a more random distribution of the deviations. 

Some higher values can be observed for liquid density and vapor pressure for the heavier 

members of the series, but still the deviations are smaller than those from the linear 

approach. 

From Figures III.1 – III.12 and Table III. 4 it can thus be concluded that if the 

evaluation of all the series of the n-alkanes using the linear perturbation model is required 

we should use, at least, two sets of reference systems. Using the new 2nd order perturbation 

just one reference system is enough.

The 2nd order perturbation model (Eq. III.6) was evaluated for the prediction of a 

broad range of saturated liquid densities, liquid viscosities and liquid-vapor interfacial 

tensions of pure n-alkanes. Reference systems for these calculations are presented in  

Table III. 2 and results presented in Tables III.5 – III.7 and Figures III.13 – III.15. 

A total of 1565 saturated liquid densities for 23 pure n-alkanes were collected from the 

DIPPR database (1998). As can be seen, very small deviations are obtained with a global 

average (expressed in terms of % AAD, Eq. I.7) of 0.58 %. Errors remain constant with the 

increase of chain length. A comparison with results from a cubic equation of state will be 

presented for mixtures in section III.4.

able to model a broad range of n-alkane viscosity data.

The 2nd order corresponding states model, Eq.III.6, was also tested for 320 n-alkane 

vapor-liquid interfacial tensions obtained from the literature (Calado et al., 1978; 

Grigoryev et al., 1992; Hunten et al., 1929; Jasper, 1972; Jasper et al., 1953 and 1955;

Wu, 1999). 

An average absolute deviation (% AAD, Eq. I.7) of 1.1 % was obtained  

(Table III. 7 and Figure III. 15). It can clearly been seen that this new model is able to 

describe both lighter and heavier n-alkanes in a broad temperature range.

Extended Corresponding States Theory 

As mentioned before, to extend the corresponding states theory to a broader range of 

fluids, additional characterization parameters other than the critical properties need to be 

introduced. Two main approaches have been applied in this parameterization: the first 

performs a multi-parameter Taylor’s series expansion of the property of interest about the 

parameters, as has been seen above with the Pitzer acentric factor; the second approach is 

to extend the simple two-parameter corresponding states principle at its molecular origin, 

by making the intermolecular potential parameters functions of the additional 

characterization parameters and the thermodynamic state, e.g. the temperature, with the 

end result being a corresponding states model that has the same mathematical form as the 

simple two-parameter model, but with more complex definitions of the dimensionless 

volume and temperature, involving the so-called shape factors. This is usually recognized 

as the Extended Corresponding States Theory (Ely et al., 2000; Marrucho, 1996). In the

remaining of this section, this approach will be presented for liquid-vapor interfacial 

tensions, as an example to evaluate its performance and limitations. 

In the extended corresponding states theory (ECST), the interfacial tension of the 

target fluid j is calculated from a single reference fluid, 1, using the following equation, 

where the reduced interfacial tension is calculated from Eq.III.16:

where hj and fj are the equivalent substance reducing ratios and ? and ? the energy and 

volume shape factors, respectively. )/T( rj1 ?? is the reference fluid interfacial tension at 

the equivalent reduced temperature, ?/Trj , calculated from Eq. III.8. 

The relationship between these quantities is given by:

The shape factors are weak functions of the reduced temperature and, in principle, of 

the reduced density. They may be evaluated by solving simultaneously any two equations 

relating the thermophysical property of the target and the reference fluid. Normally the 

compressibility factor and the Helmholtz energy are used. Several review papers have been 

published focusing on this approach and the most extensive are those of Leland et al. 

(1968), Rowlinson et al. (1969) and Mentzer et al. (1980). 

In order to apply the extended corresponding states theory to interfacial tension, 

Murad (1983) calculated shape factors by the simultaneous solution of the reduced 

compressibility factors and the reduced surface tensions. The values of these shape factors 

were then fitted to functions of the temperature and density, using the formulae proposed 

by Leach et al. (1968). 



Part III: Modeling 

- 112 - 

This procedure has the disadvantage of yielding shape factors that are not the same of 

those obtained by solving the compressibility factor and the Helmholtz energy. Since, 

theoretically, these shape factors should be the same, recalculation of these shape factors 

showed that this difference was essentially due to the lack of accuracy of the reference 

fluid data available at the time. Another weak point of the model proposed by  

Murad (1983) was the fixed reference fluid, methane, which does not allow an accurate 

mapping for heavy n-alkanes. 

Following Cullick et al. (1982), Marrucho et al. (1998) proposed a new predictive 

method for the determination of the shape factors along the saturation boundary. Using the 

Frost-Kalkwarf-Thodos (Frost et al., 1953) equation to describe the saturation pressure and 

the Rackett equation (Rackett, 1970) for the saturated liquid density, the expressions for 

the shape factors are:

This is a predictive approach if vapor pressure and liquid density data are available, 

but Zc and the exponent in the Rackett equation can be treated as adjustable parameters, 

and Br and Cr can be found by a correlation scheme.

The Corresponding States Principle

In Table III. 8 and Figure III. 16, interfacial tension values calculated using the shape 

factors from Eqs. III.22 - III.27, for several n-alkanes, C2H6-C20H42, C26H54 and C32H66 are 

compared with experimental results. An average absolute deviation (Eq. I.7) of 3.7 % was 

obtained. The selected reference fluids were n-C5H12 for the range [C2H6, n-C7H16],  

n-C10H22 for [n-C8H18, n-C12H26] and n-C15H32 for those n-alkanes with more than 12 

carbon atoms. Interfacial tension for n-hexacontane (n-C60H122) was not predicted due to 

the lack of a suitable reference fluid. Some deviations were found for the first elements of 

the series, but it should be kept in mind that experimental data for some fluids, like 

propane and n-butane, presents scatter. 

When using this model, special care should be presented in the choice of the reference 

fluid. The ideal reference fluid should be structurally similar to the target fluid and have a 

broad temperature range of interfacial tension experimental values.

Selecting a reference fluid which is not similar to the target fluid may introduce 

considerable deviations, as we can see from Table III. 8 and Figure III. 16, where is easy to 

check that as we move away from the reference fluid, deviation increases.

The two proposed models, the 2nd order perturbation model (Eq. III.6) and the shape 

factor model (Eq. III.20), are compared for n-heptane in Figure III. 17. It can be observed 

that the first yields better predictions than the shape factors model, as already expected 

from the results in Tables III.7 – III.8. This difference is due to the larger number of 

reference fluids used in the 2nd order perturbation, making it a good tool when 

interpolations/extrapolations of the reference system data are required. 

The extended corresponding states model is particularly useful when not more than 

one reference fluid is available, but if the reference fluid is not similar to the evaluating 

fluid, larger deviations can occur.

III.2.2. Simple Mixtures 

 

The simplest and most used method for extending the corresponding states principle to 

mixtures is the one-fluid approach. Each mixture, is considered to have mixture critical 

properties and acentric factor than can be replaced in the corresponding states formalism 

by equivalent pure component properties calculated via adequate mixing and combining 

rules. 

In this section, mixtures were evaluated with the new 2nd order perturbation model  

(Eq. III.6) using the one-fluid approach with the following mixing and combining rules for 

the pseudocritical parameters:

In the above equations indexes i and k represent pure components and x mole fraction. 

For the use with Eqs. III.28 - III.32, experimental critical properties and correlations for 

their estimation were selected, as presented in section II.2. 

Following Coutinho et al. (2000) a more general combining rule for the cross-critical 

temperature, Tcik, was adopted (Eq. III.32). It was shown that for phase equilibrium 

calculations, the geometric mean rule (n = 6) progressively deteriorates with component

asymmetry, with the value of n approaching 3 for extremely asymmetric systems, such as 

those involving some polymer solutions. 

Other combining rules can be derived from this expression setting different values of 

the n parameter. Setting n = 3, one obtains the geometric combining rule. 

Plöcker et al. (1978) used n = 3.75 for calculating vapor-liquid equilibria of asymmetric 

systems. Other values between 3 and 7.5 can also be found (Coutinho et al., 2000). The n 

parameter can thus be fitted or used as variable with the system asymmetry, and thus no 

binary interaction parameters are required while using this approach. 

The optimum values of n to be used with Eq. III.32 were estimated from the data 

measured in this work (Part I) and other binary mixture data from literature. The following 

objective function was used within a least-squares fit:

where subscript m denotes mixture and exp experimental value. 

While using this objective function, we consider that the 2nd order corresponding states 

model returns the correct pure component values of the thermophysical property and that 

only the curvature of the property vs. composition (the excess values) need to be corrected. 

For vapor-liquid interfacial tension an n value of 4.6 was obtained from this overall fit. 

To show how this model can represent mixture vapor-liquid interfacial tension using a 

small amount of experimental information, n-heptane, n-decane and n-eicosane were 

selected as reference fluids, and only the measurements reported in I.2.1, taken in a small 

reduced temperature range, were selected. For each reference fluid, interfacial tension was 

fitted to a two-parameter equation (Eq. III.8). 

Deviations are presented for 18 binary and 2 ternary n-alkane mixtures in Table III. 9 

using n = 4.6 and n = 6.0 in Eq. III.32. As can be seen, for low asymmetries the best choice 

is to use n = 6.0, while for the most asymmetric mixtures, deviations can be reduced to half

of their value if we select n = 4.6. An average absolute deviation of 1.1 % was found. 

Using n = 6 in Eq. III.32, an average absolute deviation about 80 % higher was obtained. 

A comparison between the model using n = 4.6 and experimental data is shown in 

Figures III.18 – III.22. 

With respect to the comparison between the binary and the ternary data, very small 

deviations are observed using this model, in agreement with the experimental results. 

Binary data calculated from the model are, in average, 0.3 % higher than that of the 

equivalent ternary mixture. Similar results can be obtained from the experimental values, 

as was noted in I.2.1. 

Results show that using only 4 to 8 pure component interfacial tension values from 

each reference fluid, one is able to estimate all the corresponding mixture data with a very 

small deviation. These results clearly show that the proposed 2nd order corresponding states 

model is adequate for the liquid-vapor interfacial tension modeling of hydrocarbon 

mixtures. 

In Table III. 10 and Figures III.23 – III.24 it is shown how this simple model can 

return liquid density estimates that deviate from the experimental data as much as different 

sets of data deviate between themselves. The previously suggested reference system 

CH4+n-C15H32+n-C26H54 was selected to obtain the reported results, using n =6 in  

Eq. III.32. As can be seen from the results, no need for further model refinement is 

required, and the model can be kept predictive for this property. 

For the viscosity modeling of the reported asymmetric systems, an optimized n value 

is essential to reduce the absolute percent deviations below 10 %, but no need for system 

dependent n-values was found. Using n= -1.5, very good viscosity estimates were obtained, 

as reported on Table III. 10 and Figures III.25 – III.26. 

Although typical n-values are in the range 3 - 7.5 (Coutinho et al., 2000), viscosity 

modeling using the corresponding states theory with the one-fluid concept presents several 

simplifications, particularly for asymmetric mixtures, as discussed by Ely et al. (1981). 

Therefore, the optimized value of n =-1.5 accounts for these simplifications, and should 

thus be considered as a fitting parameter. Only binary mixture data was used for the 

optimization. The previously suggested viscosity reference system, 

C2H6+n-C8H18+n-C18H38 was selected to obtain the reported results.

The gradient theory of fluid interfaces was combined with the Cubic-Plus-Association 

equation of state (CPA), taking advantage of the correct representation of interfacial 

tensions provided by the gradient theory and the excellent phase equilibrium of water and 

hydrocarbons obtained from CPA. 

Studies involving the vapor-liquid interfacial tensions of some selected associating 

and non-associating pure components (water, ethanol, n-butane, n-pentane, n-hexane, n-

heptane) are presented and discussed. 

A correlation for the influence parameter is presented from which surface tensions can 

be obtained in a broad temperature range with average errors smaller than 1%. 

 

III.3. Gradient Theory of Fluid Interfaces 

 

Although very powerful for the description of interfacial tensions and density profiles 

across the interface, the gradient theory has not been widely used due to its mathematical 

complexity. Most of the proposed applications are limited to the liquid-vapor interface of 

some polar and non-polar fluids and simple mixtures (Cornelisse et al., 1996; Kahl et al., 

2000 and 2002; Miqueu, 2001; Miqueu et al. 2003, 2004; Zuo et al., 1997b and 1998). Few 

authors (Kahl et al., 2000 and 2002; Zuo et al., 1998) have attempted to model  

liquid-liquid interfaces and only recently (Kahl et al., 2002) an associating equation of 

state was used for addressing liquid-liquid systems containing associating components. 



Part III: Modeling 

- 126 - 

Gradient theory is based on the knowledge of the equilibrium phase densities and the 

Helmholtz free energy density as calculated from an equation of state. For that purpose, the 

CPA EOS (Cubic-plus-Association Equation of State), an association state-of-the-art 

thermodynamic model which combines a physical contribution from a cubic EOS with an 

association contribution derived from Wertheim theory, was selected. This EOS has 

already shown to be an accurate model to describe the vapor-liquid equilibria (VLE) and 

the liquid-liquid equilibria (LLE) of mixtures containing water, alkanes and alcohols 

(Derawi, 2002; Kontogeorgis et al., 1996 and 1999; Voutsas et al., 2000; Wu et al., 1998; 

Yakoumis et al., 1998). Particularly for water-alkane systems, CPA is actually the only 

model that provides acceptable results for both the solubility of water in the  

hydrocarbon-phase and the hydrocarbon solubility in the aqueous phase (Voutsas et al., 

2000; Yakoumis et al., 1998). The good performance of this EOS for systems containing 

water and n-alkanes justified the study of its coupling with the gradient theory, as will be 

shown during this section. 

For the non-associating components chosen for evaluation, two cubic equations of 

state, the Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) (Soave,1972) and the Peng-Robinson (PR)  

(Peng et al., 1974) were selected for comparison with the CPA equation of state. 

 

Gradient theory 

The gradient theory of fluid interfaces originated from the work of van der Waals, but 

only after Cahn et al., (1958) found widespread use. Since 1958 it has been applied for the 

modeling of the liquid-vapor and liquid-liquid interfacial tension of different systems such 

as polar and non-polar fluids and some polymers. Recently, Miqueu and co-workers 

generalized the gradient theory for multicomponent mixtures (Miqueu, 2001;  

Miqueu et al., 2004):

where p is the equilibrium pressure (Pa), ? is the interfacial tension (N.m-1), ?liq and 

?vap are the liquid and vapor phase molar densities (mol.m-3), subscript N stands for the 

mixture reference component and c is the so-called influence parameter (J.m5.mol-2).

where fo(?1,...,?N) is the Helmholtz free energy density of the homogeneous fluid, at 

local composition (?1,...,?N), and µi are the pure-component chemical potentials. 

The pure-component influence parameter, cii, has a theoretical definition, that can 

hardly be implemented. For practical purposes, the influence parameter is adjusted from 

interfacial tension data (Cornelisse et al., 1996; Kahl et al., 2000, 2002; Miqueu, 2001; 

Miqueu et al. 2003, 2004; Zuo et al., 1997, 1998):

       (III. 37) 

 

The influence parameter should diverge close to the critical point, where interfacial 

tension vanishes. 

For mixtures, cross influence parameters, cij, are calculated from the pure component 

influence parameters using a geometric mean rule: 

 

jjiiij ccc =          (III. 38) 

 

A binary interaction parameter can be included in Eq. III.38, but this requires more 

computer calculations and frequently does not improve the results (Miqueu, 2001).

CPA equation of state 

Before using the gradient theory, it is necessary to determine the equilibrium densities 

of the coexisting phases, the chemical potentials and the Helmholtz free energy from an 

adequate model. The CPA equation of state was used for these purposes. CPA is an 

equation of state that combines a physical contribution accounting for physical forces and 

an association contribution accounting for hydrogen bonding and other chemical forces 

(Derawi, 2002; Kontogeorgis et al., 1996 and 1999; Voutsas et al., 2000; Wu et al., 1998; 

Yakoumis et al., 1998). Written in terms of the compressibility factor: 

 

.. assocphys ZZZ +=         (III. 39) 

 

For the physical term the Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) EOS is employed  

(Derawi, 2002; Kontogeorgis et al., 1996 and 1999; Voutsas et al., 2000;  

Yakoumis et al., 1998):

The energy parameter, a, can be calculated as a function of temperature (Eq. III.41), 

where a0 and c1, fitted from vapor pressures and liquid densities, are used instead of the 

critical constants, allowing for better liquid density estimates and thus, no further need for 

a volume correction. The co-volume, b, is simultaneously optimized with a0 and c1.

The association contribution in CPA is similar with that used in SAFT (Statistical 

Associating Fluid Theory), written below using the Michelsen et al., (2001) formalism:

fluids, such as hydrocarbons, the association term disappears and CPA reduces to SRK. 

A simplified version of the hard-sphere radial distribution function, proposed by 

Kontogeorgis et al. (1999) was employed:

Classical mixing rules are used in the physical contribution, while no mixing rules are 

required in the association term. Only combining rules are needed, in the case of  

cross-associating systems. 

To evaluate the performance of the combination of the gradient theory with the CPA 

EOS, a study was carried for some n-alkanes, an alcohol (ethanol) and water. For the  

n-alkanes, CPA is reduced to the physical contribution, thus allowing us to compare the 

results obtained from the physical term of CPA, where fitted a and b parameters are used 

(Table III. 11), with the results where the a and b expressions from SRK and PR are

Highly accurate data from the NIST Chemistry WebBook 

(http://www.webbookk.nist.gov/fluid) was selected to obtain the n-alkane vapor pressure, 

saturation liquid and vapor phase density and interfacial tension data along the saturation 

curve. 

As can be seen from Table III. 12 and Figs III.27-III.28 very good vapor pressure and 

vapor density results are obtained from CPA for the selected n-alkanes. Higher deviations 

are obtained close to the critical point, as expected from a classical EOS  

(Voutsas et al., 2000). Still, results are better or similar to those obtained from the SRK or 

the PR EOS, as the equation of state parameters were fitted to the experimental liquid 

densities and vapor pressures. As a result of this parameter fitting, considerable 

improvements can be found with CPA on the equilibrium liquid phase densities, as can be 

seen in Figure III. 28 

Limitations on the use of classical cubic EOS for the estimation of liquid phase 

densities are known, and a regular procedure to overcome this problem is to include a 

volume translation as suggested by Peneloux et al. (1982). This procedure was already 

used (Miqueu 2001; Miqueu et al., 2003 and 2004) to obtain the correct liquid densities to 

use within the gradient theory. As shown in Table III. 12 and Figures III.27 – III.28, the 

use of fitted parameters to correlate a and b on the physical term of CPA allows the 

reproduction of both liquid and vapor phase properties with a good accuracy with no need 

for a volume translation.

For the associating components water and ethanol data was collected from the NIST 

Chemistry WebBook (water) and from the correlations presented by Dillon et al. (2003) 

and from the DIPPR database (ethanol). As can be seen from Figs III.29 – III.32 and  

Table III. 12, very good vapor pressure and equilibrium vapor and liquid phase densities 

are obtained both for water and ethanol.

Using Eq. III.37 the pure component influence parameters can be computed. These are 

plotted as c/ab2/3 for n-heptane, water and ethanol, as a function of cTT /1 ? , in  

Figures III.33 – III.35. As shown for n-heptane in Figure III. 33, the three EOS present the 

same behavior in the 1-Tr range above 0.2, but for CPA the behavior close to the critical 

point is exactly the opposite of that found for SRK or PR. This qualitative trend is not in 

agreement with the theoretical definition of the influence parameter and the scaling laws 

near the critical point (Miqueu, 2001), and should be the consequence of considering 

during the fitting of the influence parameter, two different critical temperatures: one given 

by the CPA EOS and a second one implicit on the experimental interfacial tension data 

used for the fitting (that is, when ? =0). 

Since it is known that SRK, PR and CPA cannot adequately represent the critical 

region and since for most of the practical purposes, the temperature range of interest will 

be in the 1-Tr range above 0.2, a polynomial correlation can be used for the CPA influence 

parameter in order to obtain a fast estimate of the interfacial tension. As proposed before 

(Miqueu, 2001, Miqueu et al., 2003 and 2004) a linear correlation for c/ab2/3 as a function 

of 1-Tr is sufficient for the modeling of interfacial tensions when using a cubic EOS, but as 

can be observed from Figs III.33 – III.35, a quadratic correlation seems more appropriate 

while using CPA, especially for water:

Interfacial tension was calculated using these coefficients in Equation III.50. Results 

are presented on Table III. 12 in the reduced temperature range 0.45 &amp;lt;Tr &amp;lt;0.8 and  

Figs III.36 - III.38. Very good results are obtained, as presented in Table III. 12 with 

average percent deviations below 1.2 %. At higher temperatures, closer to the critical 

point, deviations are higher as already expected from the simplifications introduced with 

Eq. III.50, but as can be seen from Figs III.36 – III.38 the correct qualitative trend is 

present along all the results. 

Based on these results, future developments will include extension of the theory to 

heavier n-alkanes, some aromatics and other associating components. Then, 

multicomponent mixtures and real fluids with a vapor-liquid or with a vapor-liquid and a 

liquid-liquid interface should be considered.

The friction theory, a state-of-the art model for the estimation of viscosities based on 

the attractive and repulsive pressure terms given by an equation of state, is used in this 

section to model the viscosities reported in I.2.2. The Peng-Robinson equation of state was 

used for these purposes and the liquid densities reported in I.2.3 will also be compared 

with those resulting from this cubic equation of state. 

 

III.4. Friction Theory 

 

The recently proposed friction theory (Quiñones-Cisneros et al, 2000, 2001a, 2001b; 

Zéberg-Mikkelsen et al, 2001, 2002) was evaluated in this section for the viscosity 

modeling. This general model has been applied successfully for viscosity predictions of 

several different mixtures, such as those involving hydrocarbons (Quiñones-Cisneros et al., 

2000, 2001a), crude oil systems (Quiñones-Cisneros et al, 2001b), light gases  

(Zéberg-Mikkelsen et al., 2001), and carbon dioxide + hydrocarbon mixtures  

(Zéberg-Mikkelsen et al., 2002) over a broad temperature and pressure range. 

In this section, the simplest form of the friction theory (or f-theory) as described in 

Quiñones-Cisneros et al., (2001a) was used. 

The viscosity is modeled from a mechanical viewpoint, considering two contributions: 

one arising from the dilute gas and the other from the friction between layers, respectively, 

?0 and ?f :

Modeling results, both for liquid density (using the Peng-Robinson equation of state) 

and viscosity, are reported on Table III. 14 and Figures III.39 - III.46. Preliminary results, 

showed that the Peng-Robinson equation of state is unable to produce accurate predictions 

of the liquid densities of heavy n-alkanes, with errors propagating to the viscosities, 

leading to poor viscosity results. It is known that cubic equations of state cannot provide 

accurate liquid density estimates of heavy hydrocarbons, with a common solution being the 

incorporation of a volume translation that does not change the equilibrium and improves 

considerably the liquid phase volumetric properties (Penéloux et al., 1982). For the 

purposes of this work, following the approach used before with the friction theory, a 

different approach was taken. Critical parameters (Tc and Pc) were fitted to the liquid 

densities in order to better describe both the liquid densities and viscosities, since a good 

EOS pressure description is required within the f-theory. The fitted critical parameters are 

reported in Table III. 15, and no longer retain their physical meaning. Table III. 14 and 

Figures III.39 – III.42 show how the Peng-Robinson EOS can now adequately represent 

liquid densities. 

Good viscosity predictions are also obtained with the friction theory, as can be seen 

from Figures III.43-III.46 with the largest deviations found for the ternary systems and the 

most asymmetric mixtures containing n-heptane. No mixture information was used in 

either the EOS or in the f-theory. The heavier but less asymmetric mixture,  

n-C16H34 + n-C20H42 shows that this viscosity model can give reliable results for heavy 

components, thus supporting the idea that the larger deviations in the mixtures containing 

n-heptane arise from their asymmetry. 

Within the same mixture, major deviations were found at the lowest temperatures, 

where viscosity measurements are harder to perform, and thus more uncertain. At these 

temperatures, the PR EOS also showed the largest liquid density deviations, from which 

larger viscosity deviations may be expected from the f-theory.

These results can be compared with those obtained from the new 2nd order 

corresponding states model proposed in section III.2.2. From the deviations presented in 

Table III. 10 it can be concluded that for liquid densities both models give similar 

deviations, but to obtain lower deviations with the PR EOS it is required to tune the critical 

temperature and pressure while the corresponding states model is predictive. 

For viscosity modeling, in average, the 2nd order corresponding states model returns 

better estimates than the f-theory. 

A graphical comparison of these models can be found in Figures III.42 and III.46.

Solid-Liquid Equilibrium in Hydrocarbon Fluids

This section presents the modeling of the solid-liquid equilibria of the distillation cuts 

presented in section I.2.4. 

A simple model was selected for this purpose, the Predictive UNIQUAC, which only 

requires the n-alkane composition for the correct modeling of these systems. 

 

 

III.5. Solid – Liquid Equilibria in Hydrocarbon 

Fluids 

 

The new European standards for automotive fuels, issued under the Auto-Oil program 

(1996), are changing the way fuels are produced. There is a clear trend towards more 

paraffinic fuels (Neale, 1997; Mota, 1998), with better combustion habits, and thus more 

environmentally friendly, but that will have a worst behavior at low temperatures 

presenting higher cloud and pour points. 

The solubility of long n-alkanes strongly decreases with temperature and, for diesels, 

below 280 K, the exact liquid-solid transition temperatures depend on the n-alkane content 



Part III: Modeling

and its distribution. Below this temperature, crystals of n-alkanes start precipitating, 

plugging pipes and fuel filters. 

The production of fuels that simultaneously conform to the new European standards 

and the low temperature behavior restrictions will demand either an increasing use of 

additives, such as pour point depressants, or the redesign of the distillation to reduce the 

concentration of n-alkanes to an acceptable level. For this purpose it is important to be able 

to relate the n-alkane crystallization with the composition of the fluid. This will help to 

adequately design the production and blend of fuels, and to select the most adequate 

additives (Wang et al., 1999). 

The solid formation was described in this section as a solid-liquid equilibrium of  

n-alkanes. The general solid-liquid equilibrium equation relating the compositions with the 

non-ideality of the phases and the pure component thermophysical properties was used 

(Prausnitz et al., 1999):

In previous works were similar systems were studied, the liquid phase was assumed as 

non-ideal and modeled using the Flory-free volume equation (Coutinho et al., 1995). The 

use of this model for the liquid phase would require a more detailed knowledge of its 

composition such as a PIONA analysis or equivalent. However, the non-ideality of the 

liquid phase is not very significant (Erikson et al, 1983) and as discussed in a previous 

work (Coutinho, 2000c) to consider the solvent composed of 25 % of aromatics or being 

fully paraffinic does not change the low temperature behavior of a solution. To simplify 

the approach an ideal liquid phase was be adopted in this section.

The predictive local composition concept (Coutinho and Stenby, 1996) allowed an 

estimation of the interaction energies, ?ij, used by these models. The pair interaction

This solid-liquid equilibrium model is thus a purely predictive model that uses in the 

calculation of the phase behavior nothing but pure component properties. 

An example of the use of this model for a simple mixture involving n-C10H22,  

n-C24H50, n-C25H52 and n-C26H54 is presented in Figure III. 47. 

The n-alkane composition was experimentally obtained from the GC analysis and was 

presented in Table I. 14. No other information is required about the composition of the 

fluid. 

As discussed above, an ideal liquid phase will be assumed and thus no differentiation 

will be done between aliphatic and aromatic compounds in the liquid phase. A single 

pseudo-compound will be used to describe the liquid phase. Its concentration is given by 

the concentration of non n-alkanes obtained from the GC analysis. The choice of the 

pseudo-compound is done by matching the average molecular weight of the pseudo-

solution used in the calculation with the measured average molecular weight.

The experimental and model precipitation curves obtained are presented in  

Figure III. 48. The curves present similar shapes only shifted in temperature with 

differences that are related to the to the total n-alkane content. For the samples studied in 

this work the WAT’s nicely correlate with the total n-alkane content as shown in  

Figure III. 49. Unfortunately, as has been shown before (Reddy, 1986; Rossmyr, 1979; 

Mirante et al., 2001), this sort of correlation cannot be generalized to fluids with n-alkane 

distributions different than those used in the development of the correlation, as the WAT is 

highly dependent on the n-alkane distribution besides the total content.

Some recent results for crudes (Ronningsen et al., 1991; Delmas et al., 2000) show 

that the total n-alkane content in waxy crudes is related to the average molecular weight of 

the fluid. For the distillation cuts studied and other fuels from literature (Coutinho et al., 

2000; Reddy, 1986) it was found that such relation does not exist. The data in Table I. 14 

clearly illustrates this.

Figure III. 49:  Relation between total n-alkane content and wax appearance temperatures for the 
studied cuts. 

 

As can be seen, the model predictions agree very well with the experimental 

precipitation curves. Even for very low total n-alkane contents as for the cut from DUC oil, 

which contains only 2.8 wt% of n-alkanes, and a WAT of 256 K, an excellent description 

of the experimental data is obtained. Due to the feeble n-alkane content the DSC 

measurement for this fluid was particularly difficult due to the low intensity of the energy 

measured and thus a larger experimental error is associated to this measurement. 

Generally, it seems that the model slightly underestimates the measured precipitation 

curves. Since the DSC measurements are performed with a heating rate, that does not 

assure that the equilibrium is attained in the sample, the temperatures measured are slightly 

overestimated and this may explain the deviations between the experimental data and the 

model predictions. Other reason may reside in the inadequacies of the baseline chosen. 

Model limitations would also be another obvious explanation given the huge 

simplifications made in what concerns the sample composition. Nevertheless, and taking 

into account all the simplifications used and assumptions done, the model predictions and 

the experimental data present a surprisingly good agreement. The proposed model, using 

only the information from a GC analysis, can thus provide a quick and reliable estimate of 

the low temperature behavior of the fuel and could easily be used to plan fuel blends to 

meet some given low temperature specifications. 



Solid-Liquid Equilibrium in Hydrocarbon Fluids 

- 159 - 

As suggested before, for the distillation cuts studied it would be possible to develop a 

correlation to predict the wax appearance temperature from the total n-alkane content. 

Given the similarity of the n-alkane distributions among the studied samples, that appears 

to be completely independent of the total n-alkane content. 

It would also be possible, from the results presented, to propose an average n-alkane 

distribution for 230-375 ºC distillation cuts. Such a distribution was previously presented 

in Table I. 14. By using the average distribution, only a measurement of the total n-alkane 

content would be required to apply the model for obtaining a reliable estimate of the low 

temperature behavior of the fuel. 

 





Conclusions

III.6. Conclusions 

 

A new corresponding states model was proposed for the estimation of vapor pressures, 

liquid densities vapor-liquid interfacial tensions and viscosities of the series of the n-

alkanes. This model is predictive and only uses experimental information from the 

reference fluids and the critical properties and acentric factor from the target fluid. 

The inclusion of the second order term in the Taylor series expansion of the reduced 

property about the Pitzer acentric factor, has proved to improve the predicting abilities of 

the corresponding states principle for the entire n-alkane series, particularly for the heavier 

components. Other properties such as thermal conductivity and speed of sound showed the 

same trend of the reduced property as a function of the acentric factor, which are 

encouraging results for extending this model for other thermophysical properties. 

A reference systems was proposed for each property. Using this new 2nd order 

perturbation framework only one reference system should be enough to predict the entire 

n-alkane series. Since this model is mathematically able to represent the reduced property 

as function of the acentric factor, it is expected to interpolate/extrapolate better than the 

linear approach presented before in the literature. 

The extended corresponding states theory was also suggested for the determination of 

liquid-vapor interfacial tension, this time with the possibility of selecting an adequate 

reference fluid and given a minimum amount of information: critical temperature, critical 

volume, critical compressibility factor and acentric factor of the reference and the target 

fluid as well as some interfacial tension data from the reference fluid. Although this last 

approach has shown notable deviation, it is much simpler to use and involves less 

experimental information. The existence of a suitable reference fluid is particularly 

important for this model. 

Very good mixture liquid density results were obtained from the 2nd order 

corresponding states model. Viscosity and interfacial tension estimation using this model 

require the optimization of the cross-critical temperature combining rule, but using a 

system independent n parameter, very good results are obtained. 



Part III: Modeling 

- 162 - 

The correct volumetric and phase behavior resulting from the CPA EOS was presented 

and discussed in order to evaluate the use of this equation of state in the framework of the 

gradient theory of fluid interfaces. Using correlations to obtain the cubic and associative 

term pure component parameters, it was found that the saturated liquid phase densities 

could be obtained with a high accuracy with no need to perform any volume correction as 

usually needed while using cubic EOS with energy and co-volume parameters calculated 

from critical properties. 

Highly accurate data on pure water, n-butane, n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane and 

ethanol were selected to calculate the pure component gradient theory influence parameters 

and from these a quadratic correlation was proposed from which interfacial tension can be 

obtained in the reduced temperature range below 0.8 with average errors of less than  

1.5 %. Although this correlation was presented for a limited range of reduced temperatures, 

it was found that qualitative results could be obtained in the full liquid range for the 

selected components evaluated on this work. Future developments shall focus on mixtures 

and liquid-liquid interfaces. 

The friction theory, a general and recently proposed model for viscosity, that has 

already shown to be able to model several fluid mixtures over a broad temperature and 

pressure range, was used to describe the measured viscosity and liquid density data. In 

combination with the Peng–Robinson equation of state and after fitting the pure component 

critical properties to improve the description of the liquid densities, a good representation 

of the viscosities resulted from the f-theory. As compared with the previously proposed 2nd 

order corresponding states model it was shown that the second was the most adequate for 

the accurate modeling of the asymmetric n-alkane mixtures presented in Part I. 

Distillation cuts from five crude oils commonly used for fuel production, had their low 

temperature behavior studied. Precipitation curves were predicted by a thermodynamic 

model assuming ideal liquid phase and a solid phase whose non-ideality was described by 

the Predictive UNIQUAC model. It was shown that the model provides an accurate 

description of the experimental data and can thus be used for a quick estimate of the low 

temperature behavior of a fuel or to plan fuel blends to meet existing regulations.

Final Conclusions 

 

Several experimental measurements were presented on properties such as vapor-liquid 

and liquid-liquid interfacial tensions, liquid densities and viscosities. Measurements were 

performed in six pure n-alkanes: n-C7H16, n-C10H22, n-C16H34, n-C20H42, n-C22H46 and  

n-C24H50, 7 binary mixtures (n-C7H16 + n-C20H42, n-C7H16 + n-C22H46, n-C7H16 + n-C24H50, 

n-C10H22 + n-C20H42, n-C10H22 + n-C22H46, n-C10H22 + n-C24H50, n-C16H34 + n-C20H42), and 

two ternary mixtures (n-C7H16 + n-C20H42 + n-C24H50, n-C10H22 + n-C20H42 + n-C24H50). 

Additionally, to check the performance of the new Nima DST9005 tensiometer, the  

vapor-liquid interfacial tension of the mixtures n-C7H16 + n-C10H22, n-C7H16 + n-C16H34, 

and n-C10H22 + n-C16H34, were also considered. As shown during Part I the selected 

equipment presented deviations with respect to pure component literature data of 1 % for 

interfacial tension, 2% for viscosity and 0.1% for liquid density, thus showing their ability 

to measure with accuracy. 

Measurements were also performed on five petroleum distillation cuts in order to 

obtain some representative data for real systems containing heavier n-alkanes. These 

fractions were also characterized in terms of their molecular weights, n-alkane composition 

(gas chromatography) and solid-liquid equilibria (differential scanning calorimetry). 

Binary and ternary data were compared to check if, in a mixture, a single component, 

n-C22H46, is different from an equimolar mixture of other two, n-C20H42 + n-C24H50. For all 

the properties it was found that the binaries presented higher values of the thermophysical 

property than the equivalent ternaries, although for liquid densities the difference was very 

small. 

During Part II correlations were considered. Since for the correct modeling, accurate 

pure component properties, namely, critical temperature, critical pressure, critical volume 

and Pitzer acentric factor are required, it was first reviewed the available literature data and 

afterwards assessed some of the available correlations to extend the data for n-alkanes for 

which no experimental information existed. It was found that the Tsonopoulos (1987) 

correlation presented the best agreement with critical temperatures,  

the Magoulas et al. (1990) correlation with the critical pressures, the Marano et al. (1997a) 



Final Conclusions 

- 164 - 

correlation with the critical volumes and the Han et al. (1993) correlation with the acentric 

factors. 

Later in this chapter, a relation between liquid-vapor interfacial tension and viscosity 

was presented and discussed. Some interesting conclusions came out from this relation, as 

some chain length effects, the applicability of pure component parameters for mixtures and 

the possibility of correlating the parameters as a function of chain length or the molecular 

weight. Very good estimates of liquid-vapor interfacial tensions were obtained from 

viscosities, while viscosities obtained from interfacial tensions presented higher deviations. 

In Part III it was shown how the corresponding states principle can be used to model 

several thermophysical properties of the entire n-alkane series based on three reference 

fluids. Plots of the reduced properties as a function of the acentric factor were presented to 

show that the trend is not linear, as proposed before, and that results are considerably 

improved if we add the second order term of the Taylor series expansion. The obtained 

average absolute deviations for a broad range of pure n-alkane data were 1.1 % for the 

vapor-liquid interfacial tension, 3.7 % for viscosity and 0.6 % for liquid density. 

The application of this model to mixtures is straightforward, via adequate mixing 

rules. To obtain the best results for asymmetric systems, an adjustable parameter, 

theoretically valid, was introduced in the combining rule for the cross-critical temperature. 

Deviations were 1.1 % for vapor-liquid interfacial tensions, 4.6 % for viscosity and 0.7 % 

for liquid densities, which are quite close to the deviations found for the pure component 

properties. For liquid density no need for an adjustable parameter was required and so the 

reported results are pure predictions. For interfacial tension it was noted that the new 2nd 

order corresponding states model could adequately represent the differences between 

equivalent (in terms of average chain length of the heavier components) binary and ternary 

data. 

Based on the good performance of the gradient theory of fluid interfaces at describing 

interfacial tensions, and that of the CPA equation of sate for water-n-alkane phase 

equilibria, in section III.3 a combination of these models was evaluated for the estimation 

of equilibrium pressures and densities and vapor-liquid interfacial tensions of non-

associating (n-alkanes) and associating (water and ethanol) components. Preliminary 

results are encouraging, but a considerable body of modeling work remains to be done. 



Final Conclusions 

- 165 - 

Viscosities and liquid densities were also modeled using the friction theory, a 

state-of-the-the-art viscosity model, based on the repulsive and attractive contributions for 

pressure as given by a cubic equation of state. For the application of this theory to the 

mixtures reported in Part I, it was found necessary to tune the critical temperature and 

pressure of the heavier components, so that both good density and viscosity results were 

obtained. It this way, critical temperature and critical pressure no longer have any physical 

meaning and should be considered as fitting parameters. Obtained average deviations were 

6.0 % for viscosity and 0.6 % for liquid density. As compared with the new corresponding 

states model it was found that, for the systems evaluated in this thesis, the corresponding 

states model gave better results, while using less experimental pure component 

information. 

A model to predict the solid-liquid equilibria in paraffinic systems presented by 

Coutinho (1998) was used to describe the solid deposition curves measured for the 

petroleum cuts reported in Part I. Very good agreement was obtained, although the only 

compositional analysis used by this model was that of the n.-allkanes. 

 

Regarding the presented results, it is now considered that enough experimental and 

modeling work is available to describe systems containing both pure heavier n-alkanes or 

their mixtures with lighter components.

Perspectives for Future Work 

 

Although a considerable amount of data was presented on this thesis, an interfacial 

tension-viscosity relation was proposed, and some new and state-of-the-art models have 

been evaluated for thermophysical properties and solid-liquid equilibria of mixtures 

containing heavier n-alkanes, some questions remain to study or came up during this work 

that deserve to be mentioned as objects for further study. 

With respect to the experimental measurements, there is still a large amount of 

systems for which experimental evidence remains unavailable. For liquid-liquid interfacial 

tensions the existing data is considerably reduced: only a narrow range of temperature 

dependent data are found for each system and pressure dependency are still more limited. 

For modeling purposes data are particularly important, since only a few measurements may 

not be sufficient for an adequate model evaluation and tuning. 

Liquid-liquid interfaces have a great potential as a research subject. Not only they are 

involved in industrial products such as coatings, paints, detergents and others, as well as 

they are determining properties in some environmental processes, such as in an oil spill. 

The effect of the nature and concentration of electrolytes in the interfacial tension is an 

interesting topic since this may help us understand some phenomena happening in real 

systems. 



Perspectives for Future Work 

- 168 - 

With the new interest on nanomaterials, the interfacial properties are receiving 

increased importance, since at this scale, interfaces play a determinant role. 

With regard to other properties, while some new data have been added to literature on 

heavier n-alkanes and their mixtures, interest in heavier components, as for example the 

industrial interest in paraffin wax for the design of phase change materials for energy 

storage, may require additional measurements on thermal conductivities for n-alkanes, 

even some heavier than those reported on this thesis. With this new data, it will also be 

possible to verify the extension of the proposed models for larger molecules, and thus fill 

the gap between short length molecules and polymers. 

In Part II a relation between liquid-vapor interfacial tension and viscosity was 

presented for pure n-alkanes, their mixtures and some petroleum distillation cuts. Although 

this relation may be used to estimate liquid-vapor interfacial tensions from viscosities, as 

made by Pedersen et al.(1989), it also presented very interesting chain length effects as 

well as some information about the solid phase of those systems. Not only it was found 

that it was possible to relate a bulk phase transport property (viscosity) with an equilibrium 

surface property (interfacial tension), but also that some information about the solid phase 

could be taken from these. To my point of view, although this relation is still on the 

correlations domain, it deserves some further attention. 

Viscosities, liquid densities and liquid-vapor interfacial tensions were successfully 

modeled using an improved corresponding states model. Some results for vapor pressures, 

thermal conductivities and speeds of sound showed that this model may be easily extended 

to other properties. This is a point which remains to be issued. The extension to other 

families of fluids is another research subject which may lead to the generalization of the 

corresponding states model presented on this thesis. Ultimately, this shall be applied to real 

systems, such as the studied petroleum distillation cuts, but for these a more detailed 

compositional analysis (such as a PIONA) is required, since the measured properties are 

not only determined by the n-alkanes. 

Finally, the combination of the gradient theory of fluid interfaces with an association 

equation of state, such as CPA, has a great potential for the estimation of both vapor-liquid 

and liquid-liquid interfacial tensions, phase equilibrium and density profiles across the 

interface. The work presented in section III.3 is only the beginning of this subject, and the 



Perspectives for Future Work

final objectives are, of course, to be able to model real systems such as some petroleum 

fluids, that may contain heavier components or be mixed with a gas such as CO2, but also 

some other “non-classical” systems such as those containing aqueous mixtures of 

electrolytes or alcohols involved in liquid-liquid interfaces.

Acknowledgments 

 

I would like to acknowledge here, some people that directly or indirectly have 

contributed to this thesis and to the evolution of my studies that now end. Not only those 

that help me with a model or provide me with some of their experimental data or 

assistance, but also those that during these four years have been around me making me 

continue, helping me restart from zero, understanding my bad humor, all that! 

A PhD thesis its not a result of a single individual. Instead, it represents the progress 

achieved by working on somebody’s results. To all those that came before me, and took 

me a lot of work, many thanks! Many thanks also to those that will came after me, not 

because I will “quit” (not at all!) but because they will become interested on what I have 

made. 

First of all, I would like to thank my supervisors, João Coutinho, Isabel Marrucho, 

Erling H. Stenby and Georgios M. Kontogeorgis for believing that I could reach this point. 

Especially to João Coutinho I would like to acknowledge all the trust he has put on an 

Industrial Chemist with a tiny knowledge of chemical engineering thermodynamics. He 

introduced me to the world of thermodynamics (that’s a real world, there are still many 

places on it, which I haven’t yet visited!), but not just that! In fact I have learned not only 

with João but with all of my supervisors many things that are not thermodynamics  

(ok, some can be, it depends on the point of view). I’m especially thankful to Georgios 

Kontogeorgis, whom although not on the official supervisor list was always there when I 

needed. 

I would like to thank my parents for all the support. They understood that someday I 

would have to leave from a small village on the north of Beira Alta, and continue my 

studies. I hope that now all the effort they made was compensated. I would like to 

especially thank them for the good education they gave me and the humility lessons. 

Many thanks are also due to my friends at IVC-SEP and at the Chemistry Department 

of the Aveiro University. Particularly I would like to thank those people that have been 

more close to me during the last years, Ana Dias, Ana Isabel Caço, Nuno Pedrosa, Mara 

Freire, Nelson Oliveira, Maria Jorge Melo, Lara Rolo, Filipa Silva, Carlos Costa. Some of

them performed some experimental measurements for me, and for those I’m especially 

grateful. Yolanda Lobato and Nuria Reyes are also acknowledged for collecting and 

treating thermal conductivity and speed of sound data. 

I will always remember some persons that I met during my stays in Denmark: 

Annelise Kofod was like a mother for me, and I believe that all those that have been at 

IVC-SEP may think the same. She was always there, ready for writing me one more letter 

or helping me find one more room to rent. Acknowledgments are also extended to Anne 

Louise Biede. The technical staff at IVC-SEP was especially helpful. All the problems that 

I had there were solved very efficiently, so that I only had to concentrate myself on the 

work I was doing. Special thanks are due to Dang Thuong, Zacarias Tecle, Povl Valdemar 

Andersen and Christian Carlsson. 

I would like to make a special reference to Samer O. Derawi and Jan Addicks. The 

first shared the office with me during my first stay in Denmark and helped my with the 

CPA EOS while the second shared his flat with me for some time after I was put out my 

rented room in 2001. Fortunately, during my following stay in Denmark I was living with a 

very nice old woman, Ulla Schmidl. With her I discussed a lot about classical music, 

politics, education etc. She also introduced me to snail hunting. 

Still, on the IVC-SEP staff I should acknowledge Sérgio Quíñones-Cisneros for the 

help with the friction theory model. 

During my stays in Denmark I also met Annette and José Barreto. To them I should 

thank all the dinners they offered me, and the nice evenings we spent together at their 

home. 

During my short stay at Pau, France, I am especially grateful to Christelle Miqueu. 

From that time Christelle have been helping me in incorporating the CPA EOS in the 

gradient theory framework. Still in Pau, I must acknowledge Christophe Dauphin for the 

GC measurements on the petroleum distillation cuts. 

Back to Portugal, Luis Belchior Santos is acknowledged for performing the calibration 

of our Pt 100 temperature probe and allowing us to use of the Setaram differential scanning 

calorimeter available at his lab in Porto University.

Further acknowledgments are due to Frank Grunfeld, from NIMA Technology Ltd. for 

answering all my questions, Ascención Romero-Martinez from the Mexican Petroleum 

Institute for providing me with some vapor-liquid interfacial tension data and Jorge Ribeiro 

and Petrogal for providing the distillation cuts. 

I shall also acknowledge some financial support which made the evolution of this 

thesis possible. To Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (BD/954/2000) my special 

thanks. Without their support I wouldn’t be able to carry out all this work. To Fundação 

Luso-Americana para o Desenvolvimento and Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian I should 

thank two conference scholarships that allowed me to present some of my results on 

international meetings. 

Finally I should recognize all the support I got from my family. To Vera I owe several 

days of absence. For all the time that you were alone, while I was in Denmark, France or 

anywhere in the world. I should especially apologize for the last few months, while I was 

writing this thesis and you were taking care of Eduardo. To Eduardo I should apologize for 

my absence. I hope that in the future you will not start looking for your father each time 

you pass close to computer, as you were doing in the last months.
