RESUMO  

 

 Unidades de conservação (UC) tem sido a principal estratégia para conservação 

biológica ao longo de todo o planeta. Entretanto, nos últimos anos as UC tem sido 

desacreditadas, diminuidas e desoficializadas. Neste estudo, o papel das UC em relação a 

proteção da fauna ictica da pesca é investigada no Rio Tapajós. Parâmetros ambientais 

foram quantificados para distinguir entre as influências relativas dessas variáveis e da 

pressão pesca. Três hipóteses foram testadas: 1) UC sofrem menor pressão de pesca do que 

áreas não protegidas; 2) Pescadores de UC têm captura por unidade de esforço (CPUE) de 

peixes maior que os pescadores de áreas desprotegidas; 3) Assembléia de peixes de lagos 

de planície de inundação localizados em áreas não protegidas tem menor biomassa, 

abundância, presença de peixes de interesse, riqueza, tamanho médio e nível trófico do que 

lagos localizados em UC. Doze comunidades ribeirinhas de duas UCs de uso sustentável e 

uma área não protegida foram amostradas. A pressão pesqueira de cada área foi estimada 

usando o registro de 2013 desembarques pesqueros de 51 pescadores durante 12 meses. 

Além disso, duas coletas (período de águas altas e baixas) foram realizadas em 4 lagos em 

cada uma das áreas para amostrar a assembléia de peixes e 11 variáveis ambientas ligadas 

a físico-quimica da água, estrutura e morfologia dos lagos. O CPUE dos pescadores foi 

menor na área não protegida do que nas UCs e a biomassa total de peixes capturados foi 

maior na área não protegida. Estes resultados são a primeira evidência que UCs voltadas 

principalmente para conservação terrestre (florestal) podem atuar sinergicamente para 

reduzir os níveis da pesca e aumentar a densidade de peixes alvo na bacia amazônica. Por 

outro lado, diferenças consistentes nos descritores biológicos entre as UCs e a área 

protegida não foram encontrados nos lagos de planície de inundação. Este resultado é 

corroborado quando os desembarques pesqueiros oriundos dos lagos são analisados 

seperadamente, os quais mostram valores de CPUE de pescadores similares entre as UCs 

(áreas protegidas) e a área desprotegida. Estes descritores biológicos estiveram mais 

relacionados com parâmetros ambientais, como profundidade, cobertura de habitat e 

tamanho e morfologia dos lagos. Diferença na pressão pesqueira entre os lagos e o rio e 

também relacionadas ao co-manejo local podem estar influenciando a ausência de relação 

entre a assembleia de peixe de lagos e as UCs. Os resultados obtidos nesse trabalho indicam 

que a variação ambiental entre os lagos cria diferentes associações de espécies de peixe no 

espaço e no tempo e portanto essas variáveis devem ser levadas em conta em qualquer 

plano de manejo na Amazônia.

INTRODUÇÃO GERAL 

 

O estabelecimento de unidades de conservação (UC) tem sido a principal forma 

utilizada para a preservação da biodiversidade a nível global (Mascia et al., 2014). Desde 

a primeira UC, criada em 1872 em Yellowstone, o número de áreas protegidas tem 

aumentado exponencialmente (Andrade and Rhodes, 2012). Atualmente, existem mais 

de 144 mil UCs espalhadas por todo o mundo, cobrindo uma área de aproximadamente 

19 milhões de km², ou 12,9% da superfície da terra (Chape et al., 2008). Entretanto, a 

baixa fiscalização somado a um manejo inadequado tem levado a maior parte das UCs 

a apresentarem resultados insatisfatórios quanto as questões sócio-ambientais 

(Leverington et al., 2010). Ironicamente, esta incapacidade de atingir os objetivos 

traçados tem sido utilizada como um argumento para a desoficialização e diminuição de 

UCs em todo o planeta (Mascia and Pailler 2011; Ferreira et al, 2014; Mascia et al, 

2014). 

Ambientes de água doce estão entre os ecossistemas mais ameaçados no planeta 

(Saunders et al., 2002; Abell et al., 2008). Estimativas apontam que a taxa de extinção 

de organismos de água doce será até cinco vezes superior do que o encontrado para 

organismos terrestres (Ricciardi et al., 1999). Isso se aplica especialmente a peixes, que 

são considerados o táxon mais ameaçado do mundo entre os organismos de grande porte 

(Carrizo et al., 2013). Apesar dos ecossistemas aquáticos de água doce perfazerem 

menos de 0,3% de toda a água presente na superfície terrestre, estes abrigam mais de 15 

mil espécies de peixes, o que representa 53% de todos os peixes e 25% de todos os 

vertebrados (Reid, 2013). Existem algumas evidências suportando o efeito positivo de 

UC sobre atributos biológicos de assembleias de peixes (Ex: Biomassa, tamanho médio, 

diversidade, densidade) em ecossistemas marinhos (Halpern, 2003; Roberts et al., 

2005). Entretanto, o mesmo não pode se dizer para ecossistemas de água doce, cujos 

efeitos são muito pouco documentados e explorados (Nel et al., 2007; Gaston et al., 

2008; Abraham and Kelkar, 2012). Além disso, UCs que incluem ecossistemas de água 

doce são quase sempre projetadas com o objetivo de proteger os ambientes terrestres 

(Rodríguez-Olarte et al., 2011). Como consequência, a maior parte das UCs incluem 

apenas alguns fragmentos de bacias hidrográficas ou riachos, deixando de incluir 

regiões essenciais para o funcionamento dos ecossistemas, e, consequentemente, 

tornando-as incapazes de mitigar impactos antropogênicos (Ex: Eutrofização e 



5 
 

contaminação por mercúrio de áreas mais a montante) e conservar a biodiversidade de 

peixes (Suski and Cooke, 2007; Rodríguez–Olarte et al., 2011). 

. Os peixes formam hotspots de diversidade e são responsáveis por muitos 

processos funcionais dentro dos ecossistemas aquáticos de água doce (Vanni, 2002; 

Taylor et al., 2006; Horn et al., 2011), além de servirem como base alimentar e de 

sustento para milhões de pessoas em todo o planeta. Segundo a FAO (2014), pelo menos 

21 milhões de pessoas trabalham exclusivamente com a pesca em ambientes aquáticos 

continentais. Infelizmente, a maximização dos lucros em um curto prazo, levou a 

indústria da pesca a uma crise. Declínio de peixes tem ocorrido em todo mundo desde 

os anos 80 (Pauly et al., 2002). De forma similar, a composição de espécies presentes 

nos desembarques pesqueiros também vem apresentado mudanças. Em vários lugares 

observa-se a substituição de grandes peixes predadores por pequenos peixes 

planctívoros e invertívoros, gerando um efeito de redução do comprimento das cadeias 

alimentares (Pauly et al.,1998). Os peixes de vida longa, maturação tardia e de maior 

tamanho são afetados mais adversamente pela pesca do que aqueles peixes de vida curta, 

rápida maturação e menor tamanho corporal (Winemiller, 2005). A pesca seletiva 

unidirecional também influência as assembléias de peixes através da redução do 

tamanho médio, idade e tamanho da primeira maturação (Rochet,1998). Assim, uma 

alta pressão pesqueira pode alterar a estrutura das cadeias alimentares e, em uma escala 

mais ampla, afetar o fluxo de matéria e energia dos ecossistemas (Andersen e Pedersen, 

2010). 

Na maior parte das regiões do planeta, os principais impactos sobre a pesca em 

água doce não são causados por sobre-explotação, mas sim por fatores externos a pesca, 

como hidrelétricas e a poluição dos corpos aquáticos (Arlinghaus et al., 2002). 

Entretanto, essas conclusões devem ser analisadas com cuidado, já que a maior parte 

das pescas interiores, especialmente aquelas feitas em países tropicais 

subdesenvolvidos, são de pequena escala e descentralizadas, o que dificulta a 

fiscalização e observação dos impactos (Allan et al., 2005; Chuenpagdee and Pauly, 

2008; Castello et al., 2013a). Além disso, em muitos casos, a pesca de pequena escala é 

reconhecida por poder levar os estoques pesqueiros locais ao colapso, devido a uma 

incompatibilidade entre leis governamentais e particularidades locais (Berkes et al., 

2001; Prince, 2003; Castello et al., 2013a). Por essa razão, alguns estudos sugerem que 

a pesca de pequena escala em paisagens heterogêneas deveria ser manejada em uma 



6 
 

escala mais local em vez de ser regulado por regras gerais de manejo, como o ditado por 

UC e leis governamentais (Berkes et al., 2001; Prince, 2003; Castello et al., 2013a). 

Na Amazônia, a maior bacia hidrográfica do planeta (Goulding et al., 2003), a 

pesca é considerada uma das principais forças antropogênicas influenciando a 

assembleia de peixes (Santos and Santos, 2005; Castello et al., 2013b). Atualmente, 

cerca de 43,9 % da Amazônia Brasileira (2,2 milhões de km²) estão sob proteção 

ambiental na forma de UC, nas categorias de proteção integral, uso sustentável e terras 

indígenas (Veríssimo et al., 2011). Excluindo-se as áreas indígenas, o número de áreas 

protegidas cai para 26,5% (1,11 milhões de km²), o que ainda é superior ao encontrado 

nos biomas brasileiros da Caatinga (7,5%), Cerrado (8,2%), Mata Atlântica (9,7%) e 

Pampa (3,3%) (MMA, 2012). Entretanto, mesmo com o extenso território sob a proteção 

de UC, existem sinais de sobrepesca de algumas populações de peixes comerciais na 

Amazônia (Petrere et al., 2004; Arantes et al., 2005; Castello et al., 2013b). A principal 

espécie de peixe explorada no início do século XX (Arapaima gigas – pirarucu) é agora 

considerada ameaçada, enquanto que dentre as 18 espécies que dominam o mercado 

pesqueiro atual, uma é considerada ameaçada e outras quatro são consideradas sobre-

explotadas em pelo menos uma região da Amazônia (Castello et al., 2013b). Nesse 

sentido, a eficiência das UCs para proteger os estoques pesqueiros da sobrepesca é 

dúbio. Alguns estudos sugerem que o aplicação e fiscalização das leis raramente existe 

na Amazônia, dificultando o controle da sobre-explotação de peixes (Castello et al., 

2013). Entretanto, pelo nosso conhecimento, nenhum estudo comparou a integridade da 

assembleia de peixes e a intensidade da pesca entre UC e áreas não protegidas na 

Amazônia.  

A presente dissertação tem por objetivo investigar a intensidade da pesca em 

pequena escala e seu impacto sobre as assembleias de peixes entre duas UCs de uso 

sustentável e uma área desprotegida, sem qualquer gestão especifica. Os estudos foram 

realizados na área de planície de inundação do rio Tapajós, afluente de águas clara do 

rio Amazônas. Como a planície de inundação Amazônica apresenta uma paisagem 

profundamente heterogênea (Junk et al., 1989), uma série de variáveis ambientais 

relacionadas com à estrutura do habitat, morfologia e parâmetros físico-químicos da 

água foram medidos para distinguir a influência dessas variáveis e a pressão pesqueira. 

Três hipóteses foram testadas: 1) As duas UCs sofrem menos pressão de pesca 

(biomassa de peixes capturados) do que a área não protegida; 2) Pescadores de UC têm 

captura por unidade de esforço (CPUE) de peixes maior que os pescadores de áreas 



7 
 

desprotegidas; 3) As assembleias de peixes de lagos de planície de inundação 

localizados em áreas não protegidas tem menor biomassa, abundância, presença de 

peixes de interesse, riqueza, tamanho médio e nível trófico do que lagos localizados em 

UC.

Abstract 

 

Conservation units (CU) have been the main strategy to biological conservation worldwide. 

However, in the last years CUs have been discredited and, consequently, many of them 

have been downsized and degazetted. In this study, the role of CU regarding the protection 

of fish fauna from fisheries was investigated in the Tapajós River, a clear water tributary 

of the Amazon River. Environmental parameters were quantified to distinguish between 

the relative influences of these variables and fishing pressure. Three hypotheses were 

tested: 1) The CUs experience lower fishing pressure than the unprotected area; 2) 

Fishermen from CUs have catch per unit effort (CPUE) of fish biomass higher then 

fishermen from unprotected areas; 3) Fish assemblages from the unprotected area have less 

total biomass, abundance, presence of target fish and richness and lower mean body size 

and mean trophic level than those from CUs. Twelve riverine communities from two CUs 

of sustainable use and an unprotected area were sampled. The fishing pressure of each area 

was estimated through the record of 2,013 fish landings from 51 fishermen during twelve 

months. Besides, two surveys (high and low water season) were undertaken in four lakes 

of each area to sample fish assemblages and 11 environmental variables related to physical-

chemical parameters of water and lakes’ structure and morphology. Overall, the CPUE of 

fishermen was lower in unprotected areas than in the CUs and the total fish biomass caught 

was higher in unprotected areas. These results are the first evidence that the conditions 

provided by CUs act synergistically to reduce the levels of fishing and increase the density 

of target fish in the Amazon Basin, reinforcing the importance of these protected areas to 

socio-ecological purposes.  On the other hand, consistent differences were not found in the 

biological descriptors of fish assemblages between CUs and unprotected areas in the

floodplain lakes. This result is corroborated when the fish landings originated from lakes 

were analysed separately, showing similar CPUE values between protected and 

unprotected areas.These biological descriptors were more related with environmental 

parameters, such as depth, habitat coverage and lakes’ morphology and size. Differences 

on fishing pressure between lakes-main river and also the local management may lead the 

absence of relationship between fish assemblage in lakes and CUs. Anyhow, the 

environmental variation between floodplain lakes create different association of fish 

species and therefore these variables must be considered in management or conservation 

programs.

1. Introduction  

 

 Conservation units (CU) have been the main strategy to conserve species, habitats, 

and associated ecosystem services worldwide (Mascia et al., 2014). Since the first CU, 

created in Yellowstone in 1872, the number of new area designated to biological 

conservation have increased exponentially (Andrade and Rhodes, 2012). Currently, there 

are more than 144 thousands of CUs spread throughout the world, covering an approximate 

area of 19 million km², or 12.9 % of earth’s surface (Chape et al., 2008). However, the 

inadequate management and poorly surveillance of most CUs ultimately lead to poor 

conservation standards (Leverington et al., 2010). Furthermore, the imposition of laws in a 

top-down fashion lead to conflict with local people, whose history and culture are often 

overlooked (Andrade and Rhodes, 2012). Ironically, the failure to achieve environmental 

and social objectives are being used as arguments to a new worldwide trend of downsizing 

and degazetting the current CUs to allow commercial exploration of natural resources 

(Mascia and Pailler 2010; Ferreira et al., 2014; Mascia et al., 2014). 

 Freshwater ecosystems are among the most threatened systems in the world due to 

human activity (Saunders et al., 2002; Abell et al., 2008). Hence, the extinct rate for 

freshwater organisms is estimated to be up to five times higher than for terrestrial 

organisms (Ricciardi et al., 1999). This is particularly true for fishes, which has high levels 

of endemism and form hotspots of diversity in freshwaters (Rosenfeld 2002). Although 

freshwater ecosystems encompass 0.3 % of all surface water present on Earth, these 



10 
 

ecosystems are habitat for more than 15 thousand of fish species, representing 53% of all 

fish in the world and 25% of all vertebrates (Reid, 2013). There are several evidences 

supporting the positive effects of CUs on some biological attributes of fish assemblages 

(eg. biomass, mean size, diversity, density) in marine ecosystems (Halpern, 2003; Roberts 

et al., 2005). On the other hand, the effects of CUs in freshwater ecosystems are still poorly 

documented (Nel et al., 2007; Gaston et al., 2008; Abraham and Kelkar, 2012). Most CUs 

that include freshwater ecosystems have been designed to protect terrestrial ecosystems in 

the first place (Rodríguez–Olarte et al., 2011). As a consequence, most CUs include just 

some fragments of watersheds or streams, thus failling to include essencial regions for 

ecosystem function, mitigation of anthropogenic impacts (eg. eutrophication and mercury 

contamination from upstream), and maintenance of fish biodiversity (Suski and Cooke, 

2007; Rodríguez–Olarte et al., 2011). 

 Besides being a diverse and abundant group of organisms that play key roles in the 

functioning of aquatic ecosystems (Vanni, 2002; Taylor et al., 2006; Horn et al., 2011), 

fish are a vital food source for millions of people worldwide (FAO, 2014). Unfortunately, 

the maximization of earnings in a short-term instead of a sustainable and profit harvesting 

in a medium/long-term led the fishing industry to a crisis. Fish declines have been 

occurring worldwide since the 80s (Pauly et al., 2002), and the composition of landings 

have been changing, as large predatory fish have been replaced by small planktivorous and 

invertivorous fish (fishing-down process) in many harvested ecosystems (Pauly et al., 

1998). Long-lived fish, which have late maturation and bigger size, are more adversely 

affected by fisheries than those fish with short life, fast maturation and smaller body size 

(Winemiller, 2005). The current size-selective fishing also induce demographic changes in 

fish populations, such as the decrease of mean size and the age of first maturation (Rochet, 

1998). Thus, a high fishing pressure may alters the structure of food webs and, in a broader 

scale, the flux of material and energy of ecosystems (Andersen and Pedersen, 2010). 

 According to Arlinghaus et al. (2002), in most regions of the world, the main 

impacts over freshwater fisheries were not caused by overharvesting, but by factors not 

related to fisheries, such as impoundments and pollution of rivers. However, this 

conclusion must be viewed cautiously, since most freshwater fisheries, especially in 

tropical developing countries, are small-scale and decentralized, difficulting the recording 

of fish landings and the estimation of impacts (Allan et al., 2005; Chuenpagdee and Pauly, 

2008; Castello et al., 2013a). Small-scale fisheries may drive local fish stock to collapse 

due to the incompatibility between governmental laws and local particularities (Berkes et 



11 
 

al., 2001; Prince, 2003; Castello et al., 2013a). Indeed, some studies suggest that small-

scale fisheries in heterogeneous landscapes should be managed in a local scale, instead of 

being regulated by general management rules of CUs and governmental laws (Berkes et 

al., 2001; Prince, 2003; Castello et al., 2013a). 

  The Amazon is the biggest freshwater basin in the world (Goulding et al., 2003), 

where fishing is considered to be one of the main anthropogenic forces influencing fish 

assemblages (Santos and Santos, 2005; Castello et al., 2013b). Nearly 2.2 million km² 

(43.9%) are inside CU (integral protection, sustainable use and indigenous lands) in the 

Brazilian Amazon (Veríssimo et al., 2011). Nevertheless, the intense fishing in the basin 

led one species to the threatened status and there are evidences of overexploitation for other 

four species (Castello et al., 2013b). Besides, Castello et al. (2011) observed a current 

fishing-down process in five of nine most-caught fish in the Lower Amazon region. 

Therefore, the efficiency of CU to protect fish stock from overharvesting is uncertain. 

Several studies suggest that the enforcement and implementation of laws hardly exist in 

the Amazon, making it difficult to control overexploitation of fish (Castello et al., 2013a, 

b). Floodplain lakes are among the most important and productive environment for 

fisheries along floodplains of high order rivers in the Amazon basin (MacCord et al., 2007; 

Silvano et al., 2009; Hallwass et al., 2013). In a regional and local level, studies have shown 

higher abundance of commercial fishes in floodplain lakes where fishing is banned or 

restricted by local fishers according to co-management in the Brazilian Amazon (Almeida 

et al. 2009, Silvano et al. 2009, 2014). However, to our knowledge, no study has compared 

the integrity of fish assemblages and the intensity of fisheries between protected (CU) and 

unprotected areas in the Brazilian Amazon. 

 The objective of this study was to compare the fishing pressure of small-scale 

fishery and its impact over fish assemblages between two distinct CUs of sustainable use 

and an unprotected area without any specific management in the floodplain area (main river 

channel and lateral lakes associated) of Tapajós River, a large clear water river in the 

Brazilian Amazon. Three hypotheses were tested: 1) The two CUs experience lower fishing 

pressure (fish biomass caught) than the unprotected area; 2) Fishermen from the two CUs 

have a higher catch per unit effort (CPUE) of fish biomass than fishermen from unprotected 

area; 3) Fish assemblages from lakes in the unprotected area have lower total biomass, 

abundance, presence of target fish, richness, mean body size and mean trophic level than 

fish assemblages in the CUs. As floodplain lateral lakes are heterogeneous entities (Junk 

et al., 1989), several environmental variables, related to habitat structure, morphology and 



12 
 

water physical-chemical parameters were measured to distinguish between the relative 

influences of environmental variation and fishing pressure.  

 

2. Material and Methods 

  

2.1. Study area 

 The studied area are located in the lower section of Tapajós River, between the 

coordinates 2° 45'00'' S - 3° 25'00'' S e 55° 19’00’’ W – 54°59’00’’ W (Fig. 1). The water 

of the Tapajós River is considered to be of the clear water type, which is ologitrophic with 

low levels of sediment and nutrient concentration (Goulding et al., 2003). This river is 

situated in the Amazon Basin, where the climate is tropical humid with mean temperatures 

of 25.5°C and annual variation lower than 5°C (IBAMA, 2004). In the lower section of 

Tapajós River, the annual mean precipitation is 1820 mm with high seasonal variation 

(abundant rains in January-March). Consequently, the water level of the river varies 

significantly throughout the year. The peak of water level occurs in May-June and then 

decline until November-December, when the lower water levels are found (ANA, 2012). 

The distance between the opposite margins in the lower section of Tapajós River is large, 

reaching more than 15 km in some areas. 

 There are two CUs of sustainable use (Fig. 1) in the lower section of Tapajós River: 

The National Forest of Tapajós (FLONA) and The Extractivist Reserve of Tapajós-

Arapiuns (RESEX). The FLONA was created in 1974 through the federal decrete N° 

73.684 (IBAMA, 2004). Initially, this CU had had the only objective of sustainable use of 

timber and only in 1992 it began a process for fauna protection as well. On the other hand, 

the RESEX was officialy created in 1998, after almost 20 years of a popular struggle 

against illegal logging (ICMBIO, 2008). The riverine population of both units rely their 

activities on a diversified system of subsistence, including small scale agriculture, 

extrativist forest production, livestock farming (mainly chickens), fishing and hunting 

(IBAMA 2004; ICMBIO 2008). In relation to fisheries, both CUs only allow artisanal 

fishing gear, such as longlines, gillnets, hand lines and harpoons. The RESEX allows 

selling the fish, while in FLONA the commerce of fish is not accepted. Besides, the 

comercial fishing of large scale, typically from big cities, is not allowed in the main channel 

of Tapajós River between both CUs. On the other hand, the area outside from both CUs 

has a human density 10 times higher and both the commercial and artisanal fisheries are 

common. In 2003, two CUs from the category of Environmental Protected Area (EPA or 



13 
 

APA in Portuguese) were established in the area outside from FLONA and RESEX. In this 

study, these areas were considered as unprotected, because these EPAs are young and the 

management rules are not grounded. An official document was written for these areas in 

2012, which contain some guidelines for fisheries (eg. size of gillnets), however none 

management plan was created so far. Besides, the APAs do not have buffer zones, which 

prevents the fishing control in the main channel of Tapajós River. 

 

 

Fig. 1. Location of the study area in the Tapajós River (Brazilian Amazon). The twelve floodplain lakes, 

where the fish samples was conducted, are shown. Each lake is associated with a code (eg. TAQ), which can 

be consulted in table 1 for more specific details.  

 



14 
 

2.2. Selection of sampled lakes and riverine fishing communities  

 Four riverine communities were selected in each of the three studied regions 

(FLONA, RESEX and unprotected area; Fig. 1) following two basic premises: i- Minimum 

distance of 10 km between each riverine community; ii- Fishers of the riverine community 

accepted to participate in the study. The riverine communities selected in this study are 

similar to the other ones present in the region, which are generally composed by a small 

number of families (Mean=47.17, SD=42.63; Table 1; IBAMA, 2004; ICMBIO, 2008) of 

mixed origin (indigenous, black and caucasian), low educational level and low mean wage. 

After the selection, the leader of each community was asked to indicate the lake most 

exploited by fishers. These lakes were selected for further analysis of fish assemblages (see 

below).  

 

2.3. Measure of fishing pressure 

 The fishing landings of the riverine communities were measured during 12 months 

to estimate fishing pressure in each region. The monitoring of fish landings was conducted 

through a participatory method. Fishermen of each riverine community were selected to 

record their own fish landings through the following criteria: i) To have interest to 

participate in the study; ii) To have at least five years of basic study; iii) To fish at least 3 

days in the week. The fishermen that fulfilled the criteria above received a set of materials 

(pencil, eraser, watch, forms, briefcase and weighing device) riquired to record their 

landings. Each fisherman was trained individually and requested to registrate the five first 

fish landings of each month, begining in August 2013 until July 2014. Fishermen were 

requested to record the composition of catch (kind of fish caught), catch weight, fishing 

site (lake or river), the time spent and the number of fishermen in each fishery. Besides, 

every 15 days phone calls were made to the fishermen to discuss and solve any doubt 

regarding data recording. The filled forms of fish landings were collected every three 

months. Although 78 fishermen started to recording their fishing landings in the begining 

of the study, 51 participated in the whole study, which amounted to a total of 2,013 fish 

landings recorded (Table 1). Unfortunately, all fishermen from Maracanã community (near 

Juá lake; fig. 1), located in the unprotected area, did quit the study. Therefore, we estimated 

fishing pressure in the unprotected area using data from three riverine communities (Fig. 

1; Table 1).

2.4. Fish sampling and biological measures 

 We conducted fish samples in floodplain lakes, because they are important habitats 

to support small-scale fisheries in both white and clear water rivers in the Brazilian 

Amazon, besides being suitable spatial units for sampling and management, as lakes have 

clear efined boundaries during the low water period (Silvano et al. 2009, 2014). Two 

samplings were undertaken in each one of the 12 lakes indicated by the leaders of riverine 

communities (Fig. 1, Table 1). The first sampling was made in July (high water season) 

and the second was made in November (low water season). Fish were collected using two 

sets of gillnets (~420 m² each) with different mesh sizes (15, 25, 35, 50, 60, 70 and 80 mm 

between opposite knots) during ~ 9:30 hours (SD=0:46), starting around 8:30 a.m and 

ending around 6:00 p.m. The gillnets were checked every 2 hours and the fish trapped in 

the net were collected. Gillnets were used to sample fish in this study because it is the main 

type of fishing method used by fishermen in Amazon (MacCord et al., 2007; Hallwass et 

al., 2013), besides being widely used in scientific studies related to fisheries.

 Each individual fish captured was measured to standard length (SL, precision to 0.1 

cm), weighed (to precision of 1 g), anaesthetized with clove oil, preserved in a 10% 

formalin solution and identified to species level. When many individuals of the same 

species in a given sample were caught, a subsample was collected for species identification 

(typically 10 or less individuals, due to logistical constraints) and the remaining fish were 

identified in the field and donated to local people. More details of these sampling 

procedures can be found in previous studies (Silvano et al., 2009, 2014). 

 The sampled fish were also desiccated for diet analysis in order to estimate trophic 

position.  Ingested prey was identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible (generally 

family or order) using specialized literature (Merritt and Cummins, 1996; Fernandez and 

Dominguez 2001; Hamada et al., 2012; Queiroz et al., 2014). The volumetric method 

(Herran, 1998) was used to quantify prey importance. Additional diet information were 

also included from literature for those species with less than 10 individuals analyzed 

(Mérona et al., 2001; González and Vispo, 2003; Melo et al., 2004; Mérona and Rankin-

de-Mérona, 2004; Layman et al., 2005; Blanco-Parra and Bejarano-Rodríguez, 2006; Silva, 

2006; Freitas, 2007; Godoi, 2008; Silva et al., 2008a; Silva et al., 2008b; Vasconcelos and 

Oliveira, 2011; Hawlitschek et al., 2013; Sá-Oliveira et al., 2014; Details in supplementary 

data - A). In cases when few or none individuals were dissected in this study and none 

specific literature information were available for a given fish species, the trophic level of 

this species was estimated based on close related species from the same genus. 

  

2.5. Characterization of lake structure, morphology and  physical-chemical parameters  

 Variables related to physical-chemical parameters of water (pH, conductivity, 

temperature, depth and euphotic zone), the habitat coverage (percentage of macrophytes, 

flooded forest and pelagic zone), the morphology (surface area and shoreline development) 

and the distance to the Amazon River for each lake and for each season were measured.  

These variables were chosen due to their reported influence on fish assemblages in previous 

studies (Junk et al., 1983; Rodriguez and Lewis, 1997; Tejerina- Garro et al., 1998; Olden 

et al., 2001; Petry et al., 2003; Carolsfeld et al., 2004).   

 Twelve measures of physical-chemical parameters of water (six measures between 

9-10 a.m. and six between 3-4 p.m.) and depth were made for each lake and for each season. 

The pH, conductivity and temperature were measured using a Digital Water Quality 

Checker, whereas the euphotic zone was estimated through a Secchi Disk. The depth was 

measured using a graduated cord. The percentage of habitat coverage was estimated 



17 
 

visually by a single person. Since the sizes of most lakes were not large enough to be 

precisely measured by satellite images, the visual method turned out to be more accurate 

to measure habitat coverage. 

 The surface area, shoreline development and the distance to Amazon River were 

estimated using images from the Landsat5 satellite, obtained through the National Institute 

for Space Research (INPE, 2014). The shoreline development was calculated through the 

following equation: 

Shoreline development =  
?

2?? ? ?
 

, where L is the shoreline length and S is the surface area of the lake.  Due to the absence 

of sharp images (without clouds) during the study year, images from the same season of 

the study but from different years were used: Low water season (November) of 2008 and 

High water season (July) of 2009. According to records of water levels of Tapajós River  

obtained from the Hydrological Information System of Brazil (HidroWeb; ANA, 2014), 

both months of November 2008 (Max=246cm, Mean=214cm, Min=184cm) and July 2009 

(Max=790cm, Mean=753cm, Min=718cm) had water levels similar to the respectives 

months of 2013 (July: Max=726cm, Mean=690cm, Min=654cm; November: Max=296cm, 

Mean=275cm, Min=246cm). The band composition (5,4,3 in RGB composition) and image 

analysis were made through the commercial software ArcGis 9.2. 

 

2.6. Variables calculated 

 The Index of Relative Importance (IRI) modified by Pinkas et al. (1971) was used 

to determinate the importance of each species caught by the riverine communities. The IRI 

was calculated as follows: 

???? = (?? + ?? ) ???   

, where Ni is the numerical percentage of the ith species in all fish landings, Wi is the weight 

percent of the ith species in all fish landings and FOi is the frequency of occurrence 

percentage of the ith species in all fish landings.  

We used the IRI to calculate an Indicator of Valuable Fish Presence (IVFP) in each 

lake according to the equation: 

IVFP?  =  ????? ???? 

, where IRIi is the Index of Relative Importance of the ith fish and RAki is the relative 

abundance of the ith fish in the kth lake. High values of IVFP in a lake suggests a great 

proportion of species relevant for fisheries, which have higher IRI values. 



18 
 

 The species richness was estimated for each lake through individual-based 

rarefaction procedure (Gotelli and Colwell, 2011). The trophic position of each species 

caught in the studied lakes was determined according to the equation: 

??? = 1 + ????? ??? 

, where DCij is the fractions of each jth prey in the diet of the ith predator and TLj is the 

trophic level of the jth prey (Pauly et al., 2001). The trophic level of basal itens ingested 

(Detritus, Plant, Algae) was considered 1, invertebrates ingested were considered 2 and 

fish ingested was considered 3 (Hoeinghaus, 2009). Thereafter, we used the TL of each 

species to calculate the mean trophic level (MTL) of each lake according to the following 

equation: 

 ???? = ? ??? ???? 

, where TLi is the trophic level of the ith fish and the RAki is the relative abundance of the 

ith fish in the kth lake (Pauly et al., 2001).   

   

2.7. Data analysis 

2.7.1. Fishing pressure 

 The fish landings from the riverine communities were grouped in four main seasons 

according to the water level: Seca (low water), Enchente (rising water), Cheia (high water) 

and Vazante (falling water). The total biomass of fish caught and the biomass catch per unit 

effort –CPUE (fish biomass divided by the number of fishermen and the time spent fishing) 

– were used to assess fishing pressure of each fisherman in each season. The linear mixed 

effects analysis were carried out to test the influence of CU over fish landings (total 

biomass and CPUE of biomass) during these four main seasons. Areas (FLONA, RESEX 

and the unproctected area) and seasons were entered into the model as fixed effects, 

whereas fisherman was entered as a random effect. The factors significance (P- values) 

were obtained by likelihood ratio tests comparing models with and without the variables of 

interest (Winter, 2013). The mixed model analysis was conducted with two datasets: 1) 

Fish landings from both lakes and the main river; 2) Fish landings only from lakes. This 

was necessary to understand the effects of fishing on these two environments, since 

previous studies suggest a high connectivity between fish assemblages of lateral lakes and 

the main river channel in the Amazon (Fernandes, 1997; Winemiller and Jepsen, 1998).  

Both total biomass and the CPUE were log transformed to meet normal distribution 



19 
 

assumption. The linear mixed effects analysis was carried out in the R package lme4 (Bates 

et al., 2014). 

   

2.7.2. Fish assemblage and environmental variables 

 The model averaging (Burnham and Anderson, 2002) was used to obtain robust 

estimates of relative importance value (I) for both environmental variables (pH, 

conductivity, depth, eufotic zone, surface size of the lake, shoreline development, 

percentage of macrophytes, percentage of flooded forest, percentage of pelagic zone, 

distance from the Lower Amazon River) and management variables (protected or 

unprotected areas). These independent variables were used as predictors for each one of 

the dependent variables: fish biomass, richness, abundance, mean size, MTL and IVFP, for 

each season (high water and low water). The model averaging was carried out according 

to the following steps: 1) all possible models (linear) were fitted to data; 2) the second order 

Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) was used to measure the plausibility of each 

candidate model; 3) The Akaike weight  was calculated for each model (wi) normalized 

across the set of candidate models to sum to one; 4) The Akaike weights were used to 

obtain averaged estimates for each  parameter; 5) The relative importance of each predictor 

variable was calculated by summing all Akaike weights over all models that include each 

predictor. The relative importance ranges from 0 to 1, and the larger the value of the relative 

importance of a predictor, the more important it is compared to the others (Burnham and 

Anderson, 2002).  To avoid multicollinearity between predictors, the Principal Component 

Analysis (PCA) was carried out to group the following variables into principal components 

axis in both seasons: 1) the percentage of pelagic zone, flooded forest and macrophytes; 2) 

Conductivity, pH, depth and euphotic zone. A Pearson correlation was carried out between 

predictors and descriptors to assess the direction (negative or positive) and slope of each 

relation.  The biomass was log transformed to meet normal distribution assumption. The 

model averaging procedure was conducted in the R package glmulti (Calcagno, 2013), 

whereas the PCA in the package stats (R Core Team, 2014). 

 The nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was used to access the variation 

in fish composition among the 12 sampled lakes in each season. This ordination was carried 

out through two axis using the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity. The environmental and 

management predictors were correlated onto the NMDS ordination using vector fitting, 

which quantify the strength of relationships through the correlation coefficient (r²; 

Oksanen, 2013). Only the predictors that had high influence in the model averaging 



20 
 

procedure were included in this step. The significance (P value) between the ordination and 

the predictors was assessed after 10000 permutations. Both the vector fitting and the 

NMDS ordination were carried out in the R package vegan (Oksanen et al., 2009). 

 

3. Results 

 

3.1. Fishing pressure 

 A total of 18,241 kg of fish were caught in the fish landings registered by local 

fishermen during the study (~ 9.07 kg per landing, SD=12.74). From the 2,013 fish landings 

registered, 67.2% occurred in the main river, while 32.8% occurred in lakes (Table 2). The 

jaraqui (Semaprochilodus spp.; IRI= 6.68), pescada (Plagioscion spp.; IRI= 6.35), aracu 

(Anostomidae; IRI= 4.82), charuto (Hemiodontidae; IRI=4.68), acaratinga (Geophagus 

surinamensis; IRI=3.85) and tucunaré (Cichla spp.; IRI=1.14) were the main fish caught 

by fishermen (more details in Tables 2 and Hallwass et al., in press).  

  The exclusion of the interaction term between season and areas in the model 

resulted in a significant loss of variance explanation from both CPUE (?2(6)= 1417.7 

P&lt;0.001) and total biomass (?2(6)= 34.053 P&lt;0.001) of fish caught by fishermen in both 

environments (lakes and the main river). Corroborating the first hypothesis, the total 

biomass caught by fishermen was higher in the unprotected area than in the protected ones 

in all seasons (Fig. 2b), except during the falling water season when the RESEX had total 

caught similar to the unprotected area. Inside protected areas, the total fish biomass caught 

by fishermen from FLONA was smaller than those caught by fishermen from RESEX, 

except in the high water season when fishermen from FLONA caught more fish (Fig. 2b). 

As predicted by the second hypothesis,  the CPUE was lower in communities located in 

the unprotected area than in communities located in the protected areas, except during the 

low water season, when the CPUE was similar beween the areas (Fig. 2a). The 

communities inside the two protected areas, FLONA and RESEX, had similar values of 

CPUE, except during the falling waters, when RESEX had higher CPUE values (Fig. 2a). 

When considering only fish landings from lakes, the CPUE did not differ between protected 

and unprotected areas (?2(6)= 0.29 P&gt;0.05; Fig. 2c), while the interaction term between 

season and areas was significant for the total biomass (?2(6)=18.6 P=0.004; Fig. 2d). 

Overall, lakes from protected areas were less fished (had lower total fish biomass) than 

lakes from unprotected area, except in the falling water when protected areas and the 

unprotected area had similar values.

3.2. Environmental variables and fish assemblages 

 There was a high variability in the structure, morphology and physical-chemical 

parameters among the studied lakes (Supplementary data - B). The percentage of pelagic 

zone, flooded forest and macrophytes (herein called “habitat coverage”) were successfully 

reduced into a principal component analysis for the high water and low water seasons. The 

Habitat Coverage PC1 explained 78% of total variation in the high water season and 85% 

in the low water season (Table 3). On the other hand, the conductivity, pH, depth and 

euphotic zone (herein named Physical and Chemical Parameters) were reduced into a 

principal component in the high water season (explaining 69% of total variation; Table 3) 

and two in the low water season (explaining 48% and 33% respectively; Table 3).

 A total of 879 fish of 67 different species were collected (Table 4): 334 fish (30 

species) were caught in the high water season and 545 (56 species) in the low water season. 

The collected fish range from 1 g (5.7 cm) to more than 5 kg (1.1 m), while the mean 

trophic level (MTL) ranged from 2.3 to 3.39. According to the model averaging process, 

the CU (Fig. 3) were one of the most important variables to describe the variation of the 

following three descriptors of fish assemblage: mean fish size in the high water season 

(I=1) and MTL (I=0.88) and IVFP (I=0.9) in the low water season (Details in Table 5). 

However, the fish size, MTL and IVFP were not consistently higher inside CUs as expected 

by the hypothesis 3 (Fig. 3 d, e, f, respectively). On the other hand, environmental variables 

showed to be substantial predictors of five descriptors (Abundance, biomass, fish size, 

MTL, and richness; Table 5). More specifically, the surface size of the lake was an 

important descriptor for richness in the dry season (I=0.87, Correlation=0.63). The 

shoreline development was one of the best predictor of abundance (I=0.75, Correlation =-

0.59) and mean fish size (I=0.86, Correlation= 0.26) in the wet season.  The Physical-

Chemical parameters that were reduced into a PCA1 in the wet season turn out to be an 

important predictor to explain the variation of the MTL (I=0.99, Correlation= -0.80). The 

first axis of Physical-Chemical parameters of low water season was the best predictor to 

explain both biomass (I=0.82, Correlation=-0.62) and abundance (I=0.87, Correlation=-

0.69), while the second axis was important to explain richness (I=0.53, Correlation=0.57). 

The principal component (PC1) of habitat coverage was an important descriptor of 

abundance in the wet season (I=0.65, Correlation=-0.51) and of biomass (I=0.74, 

Correlation=-0.58) in the dry season. Finally, the distance to Amazon River was not an 

important predictor to any descriptors of fish assemblage in both seasons. The best models 

according to AICc for fish assemblage descriptors (Total Biomass, Richness, Abundance, 

Mean Length, MTL and IVFP) are in Table 6.

 The NMDS ordinations of lakes according to fish assemblage (Fig. 4) had stress 

values lower than 0.15 (Wet = 0.11, Dry = 0.14), which indicated a reliable pattern. There 

were marginally significant relationships between the first principal axis of the physical- 

chemical parameters (p=0.069, r²=0.45) and the habitat coverage (p= 0.059, r²=0.46) with 

fish assemblage in the wet season. In relation to the dry season, the first axis of physical- 

chemical parameters had significant influence (p=0.01 r²=0.65) over fish assemblage, 

while the protected areas had just marginally significant relationship (p=0.057, r²=0.35).  

 

4. Discussion 

 

4.1. Fishing pressure and conservation units 

 Like most CUs that include freshwater ecosystems, both FLONA and RESEX were 

not specifically designed to protect freshwater ecosystems and their associated organisms. 

Instead, FLONA and RESEX were created to protect the Amazon forest from logging 

(IBAMA, 2004; ICMBIO, 2008). Nevertheless, lakes and the river in the unprotected area 

were more intensely fished (had a higher total biomass of fish caught) than protected areas. 

Besides, fishermen from the unprotected area also spent more time and labor fishing (had 

a lower CPUE) than fishermen from the two protected areas. These results agreed with our 

hypotheses and indicate that the conditions provided by the protected areas in the Tapajós 

River, such as lower human population density, general management rules and higher 

environmental integrity (eg. less pollution and deforestation), may act synergistically to 

reduce the levels of fishing pressure and increase the density of target fish.  

 Even with lower levels of fishing and higher abundance of fish, FLONA and 

RESEX may not be capable to conserve and maintain a great portion of fish stock in the 

Tapajós River alone. Overall, the role of CU for fish protection depend on fish movement 

and the size of the protected area: sedentary animals tend to be more protected by CUs than 

those that constantly cross the boundaries of protected areas (Palumbi, 2004; Baird and 

Flaherty, 2005). In tropical rivers, which typically have high variation in hydrological 



28 
 

regime, the key biological factor behind the maintenance of high diversity of fish species 

is movement (Lowe-Mcconnell, 1999). Most fish species of Amazon undertake lateral 

(Fernandes, 1997) or longitudinal (Barthem and Goulding, 1997; Carolsfeld et al., 2004) 

migrations at least once in their life cycle (Winemiller and Jepsen, 1998; Lowe-McConnell, 

1999). In oligotrophic waters, such as the Tapajós River, the role of migratory species to 

sustain fisheries is vital. Species from several families of characiformes and siluriformes 

migrate from rich nutrient waters to poor nutrient waters in specific seasons to feed and 

spawn (Carolsfeld et al., 2004), increasing the secondary productivity of oligotrophic rivers 

and consequently the income of fishermen (Barthem and Goulding, 1997, 2007). Fisheries 

in the Tapajós River include species that perform long migrations, such as 

Brachyplatystoma rousseauxii, B. filamentosum and Semaprochilodus insignis. Therefore, 

to ensure the maintenance of fisheries and the conservation of biodiversity in the Tapajós 

River, as well as in other tropical rivers, it is necessary to create a network of CUs in 

strategic points of spawning and feeding areas in a broad scale, and ensure connectivity 

between rivers with poor and rich waters (Barthem and Goulding, 1997; Pelicice et al., 

2014). 

  In a fishing perspective, it would be desirable that protected areas become a source 

of fish population to support human harvesting in the surroundings. For example, in the 

Mekong basin at least eight species of fish spill over from Freshwater Conservation Zones 

(FCZs) to nearby regions, contributing to local fisheries (Ounboundisane et al., 2013). 

Similarly, in a co-management perspective, it have been suggested that non-fished lakes 

may be a source of fish for fished lakes in a sustainable CU in the Brazilian Amazon 

(Silvano et al., 2009). However, it is not necessarily true that just because an area is not 

fished (or less fished) it would become a source of fish for other areas. In many cases, CUs 

are established in unproductive areas with low commercial interest (Scott et al., 2001; 

Hansen, 2011). Therefore, these habitats may have harsher biophysical conditions for 

organisms, being a sink instead of a source of biomass (Hansen, 2011). In Tapajós River, 

the observed high levels of CPUE in CUs indicated higher fish density in protected areas, 

however it is difficult to determine if there is a spillover effect. Similar to most regions in 

the world (Geisler, 1993; Guidetti, 2002), the Tapajós River lacks studies from before the 

establishment of CUs, which could elucidate the effect of protected areas as sources of 

biomass for fisheries in unprotected regions.  Currently, there is a gap of information in 

relation to the spillover effect of CUs in the Tapajós River as well as in other freshwater 



29 
 

ecosystems worldwide. Future studies aiming to quantify the spillover effect in freshwater 

ecosystems will find an unknown and prosperous research field in the next years.

Level) and f) IVFP (Indicator of Valuable Fish Presence) between the conservation units (UC)  in the high 

water and low water season. Asterisks (*) symbolize high importance according to the model averaging 

approach. 

 

 The two protected areas (FLONA and RESEX) differed in fishing pressure and 

CPUE in at least two seasons (low water and falling water). Fishermen from RESEX had 

higher values of both CPUE and total biomass. It is likely that these differences between 

FLONA and RESEX are consequences of differences in management rules and 

environmental characteristics. Although management rules related to fishing equipments 

are similar in both CUs, the fish commercialization is just allowed in RESEX (ICMBIO, 

2008), which led fishermen to intensify the capture of fish and consequently their incomes 



30 
 

(Hallwass et al., in press). Besides, the main depth channel of Tapajós River is located near 

to RESEX’s shorelines (Hallwass et al., in press). According to local fishermen, this depth 

channel is an important fishing spot to catch important target species with large size, such 

as pescada (Plagioscion spp.) and filhote (B. filamentosum) (Hallwass et al., in press).

4.2. Effect of CU over fish assemblage in floodplain lakes 

 Although fishermen from the two CUs had a higher CPUE than fishermen from 

fishing communities in the unprotected area, no effect of CUs was found on fish landings 

originated from floodplain lakes. These results were similar to results from experimental 

fish samples carried out in the floodplain lakes: Fish community descriptors, such as the 

biomass, abundance and richness, were similar between the two CUs and the unprotected 

area. On the other hand, the biological attributes of fish assemblages were more related to 

environmental variables (shoreline development, physical-chemical parameters, habitat 

coverage and surface size).  Although some variation in mean fish size, mean trophic level 

and the presence of valuable fish were found among CUs, smaller values of these 

parameters were not indentified in the unprotected area, as expected. For example, the 

mean trophic length (MTL) was higher in RESEX’s region, but the FLONA’s region 

(protected area) had a MTL similar to that observed in the unprotected area in the dry 

season.  Interestingly, the IVFP was the inverse in this period, with RESEX’s region with 

smaller values than FLONA and the unprotected area. This unexpected negative relation 

between MTL and IVFP resulted from a high preference for fish with low trophic level, 

such as charuto (Hemiodontidade family), jaraqui (Semaprochilodus spp.) and aracu 

(Anostomidae family) in the Tapajós small-scale fisheires. 

   The observed low influence of  CUs on fish assemblages in lakes may be due to 

the low levels of fishing in this habitat, as most of fish registered in fish landings were 

caught in the main river channel. Therefore, the fishing impact (eg. lower CPUE) could be 

more evident in the main river channel than in floodplain lakes. Such preference for the 

main river channel instead of floodplain lakes differs from what was observed in productive 

rivers with white water in the Brazilian Amazon, such as the Solimões River, where 

fisheries are usually concentrated in lakes, at least during the low water season (MacCord 

et al., 2007). The floodplain of Tapajós River, including the abundance and size of 

floodplain lakes, is smaller than that of other rivers of the same order in the Amazon Basin 

(Goulding et al., 2003). Besides, the mean fish density (0.54 g * m-2 * h-1, standardized 

CPUE) found in floodplain lakes of Tapajós River was low compared to other Amazonian 

rivers sampled using comparable methodology, such as Japurá and Solimões (22.4 g and 

13.5 g , Henderson and Crampton 1997; Silvano et al., 2009, respectively), Manacapurú 

(14.5 g, Saint-Paul et al. 2000), Mucajaí (3.7 g, Ferreira et al. 1988), Lower Tocantins (5 g 

and 2.84 g, De Merona, 1986 ? 87; Silvano et al., 2014, respectively), Trombetas (10.2 g, 

Ferreira, 1993) and Negro (2.69 g, Silvano et al. 2005). Therefore, the floodplain lakes of 



32 
 

Tapajós River may be less attractive for fishermen compared to lakes in other rivers, due 

to the low densitiy of fish. Nevertheless, differences in fish species composition between 

lakes and the main river channel may also had contributed to the discrepancy between 

results from fisheries and the fish assemblage in lakes. Abundant target fish, such as 

Pellona spp., Plagioscion spp., Hypophthalmus spp., B. filamentosus and B. rousseauxii 

were almost exclusively caught by fishermen in the main river, indicating their low density 

in floodplain lakes. 

 The absence of CU effects on fish assemblages in floodplain lakes may also be 

result of management in a small scale. The co-management is a coalition of local riverines, 

who create rules to avoid local resource overexploitation and protect the resource from 

outsiders (MacCord et al., 2007, Lopes et al., 2011). Although this co-management activity 

are rarely recognized as a legal activity by the government, surveys have been suggested 

that these local coalition can have good results to maintain or increase the resources 

productivity and sustainability in tropical developing countries (Cinner et al., 2005; Sultana 

and Thompson, 2007; Silvano et al, 2014). In the Tapajós River, evidences from interviews 

with fishermen suggest that some riverine communities have local rules regarding fish 

harvesting (Hallwass et al., in press). From the 12 studied communities, two communities 

from unprotected area (Maracanã and Alter do Chão), one from FLONA (Pini) and two 

from RESEX (Jauarituba and Vila do Amorim) have some initiative of  co-management in 

adjacent lakes (Hallwass et al., in press). Althought the co-management effect have never 

been checked in the Tapajós River, Silvano et al. (2014) demonstrated that for Tocantins 

River, other clear water river from Amazon, the co-management influence positively 

fishing yields of fishing communities and fish abundance in floodplain lakes. 

 

4.3. Effect of environmental variables on fish assemblages 

 Floodplain lakes from Tapajós River showed high environmental heterogeneity in 

space and time. This variability led to different association of fish assemblages as have 

already been suggested by several studies in the Amazon basin (Junk et al., 1983; 

Rodriguez and Lewis, 1997; Tejerina- Garro et al., 1998; Petry et al., 2003). The physical-

chemical parameters (depth, conductivity, euphotic zone and pH) were the most important 

environmental variables, influencing the trophic level, biomass, richness, abundance and 

composition of fish in the Tapajós River. Depth has been considered the primary controller 

of the variability observed in the other physical-chemical parameters measured (Rodriguez 

and Lewis, 1997). In this sense, the results present here confirm the importance of depth to 



33 
 

determine fish assemblage, especially regarding to trophic level (Miranda, 2011) and the 

number of fish captured (Petry et al., 2003). On the other hand, the surface size of the lake 

was a good descriptor for richness, indicating a classic species-area relationship 

(Arrhenius, 1921). There are several hypotheses that explain the species-area relationship, 

which are not necessarily mutually exclusive but vary in complexity (Neigel, 2003). For 

example, the random placement hypothesis (MacArthur and Wilson, 1963), the most 

parsimonious one, suggest a simple effect of sampling, while the habitat heterogeneity 

hypothesis (Williams, 1943) suggest that larger areas enclose more diverse types of micro-

habitats and therefore include more species. Anyhow, because to conserve a high number 

of species is a common goal of management programs (Groom et al. 2005), floodplain 

areas that include bigger lakes should be prioritized to conserve fish biodiversity.  

 The habitat coverage influenced the biomass and abundance of fish in floodplain 

lakes of Tapajós River. More specifically, the percentage of macrophytes was positively 

related to fish biomass, while flooded forest was negatively correlated with fish abundance. 

This result corroborate previous studies, which indicate that the environmental 

heterogeneity provided by the presence of macrophyte banks may promote the diversity 

and abundance of fish, due to protection and feeding (Petry et al., 2003; Agostinho et al., 

2007). In this sense, the maintenance of macrophyte banks in lakes may be important to 

increase fisheries income directly, increasing the biomass of target fish, or indirectly, being 

a nursery habitat for juvenile fish or providing a feeding habitat for larger fish. On the other 

hand, flooded forests are an important source of food in Amazon tributaries that contain 

oligotrophic waters (Goulding and Ferreira, 1988), such as the Tapajós River. Since the 

samples were carried out exclusively in the pelagic habitat, the wide extension of flooded 

forest in the wet season could act as an atractor for fish, decreasing the density of fish in 

the pelagic zone. Furthermore, lakes with developed shorelines had more contact area with 

the surrounding forest, and, perhaps, the observed negative correlation between shoreline 

development and fish abundance may also be influenced by the percentage of flooded 

forest.  

 The landscape of floodplains in the Amazon change drastically from season to 

season, due to changes in the water level of the main river (Junk et al., 1989). Fish respond 

to this periodic flood pulse through morphological, anatomical, physiological and 

ethological adaptations (Junk et al., 1989). Consequently, it is likely that the structure of 

fish assemblages change between seasons (Junk et al., 1997). The results showed in this 

study indicate that fish assemblages also respond differently to environmental conditions 



34 
 

between the seasons. The biological parameters calculated for fish assemblage (eg. 

biomass, richness, abundance) were correlated with different environmental variables in 

the low water and high water season. For instance, the abundance was correlated with 

shoreline development and habitat coverage in the high water season, while in the low 

water season it was correlated only with physical-chemical parameters (depth, euphotic 

transparency). Several factors may operate to induce different responses of fish 

assemblages to distinct environmental parameters between seasons. The change in fish 

density between the low and high water season in the Amazon floodplain (Fernandes, 1997; 

Begossi et al., 1999; Silvano et al., 2000; Cerdeira et al., 2000; MacCord et al., 2007; 

Cardoso and Freitas, 2008) may affects the response of fish to environmental variables 

(Arrington et al., 2005). More specifically, as fish assemblage get closed to saturation, 

through the increase of fish density, the fish assemblage become increasingly non-random 

due to an increasing importance of species-specific responses to habitat characteristics 

(Arrington et al., 2005). Besides, the change in fish composition (Fernandes 1997) and in 

the range of environmental parameters (Junk et al., 1989) between the high water and low 

water seasons may also determine how fish assemblage vary in the floodplain. 

 In this study, the fish composition was associated mainly with changes in chemical-

physical structure and habitat coverage. Several studies attested that floodplains in Amazon 

are mosaics where species composition is determined by environmental characteristics 

peculiar to individual sites (Tejerina-Garro et al., 1998, Petry et al., 2003, Correa et al., 

2008, Freitas et al., 2014).  In this sense, Amazonian lakes are not equivalents regarding 

fish species composition, and therefore a successful plan to conserve the fish biodiversity 

should be large enough to include multiple sites (Freitas et al., 2014). Both FLONA and 

RESEX are large CUs (&gt; than 589,000 ha) and include lakes with different shapes, habitats 

and physico-chemical characteristics. Furthermore, the more recent EPAs (APAs in 

Portuguese) may play an important role in the conservation of floodplain heterogeneity, 

protecting an even large area of floodplain in the region.  On the other hand, in unprotected 

areas, the management in a small scale could be the best option to control the strong effect 

of environmental variables and to reduce the fishing pressure, ensuring the stock 

sustainability in floodplain lakes (Prince, 2003; Castello et al., 2013a). However, to ensure 

that small scale management occur appropriately, it is fundamental the participation and 

commitment of local communities and the presence of trained local managers to avoid 

inadequate decisions (Prince, 2003).

5. Conclusions 

  

 The fish landings of riverine communities indicated that fisheries are more intense 

in the unprotected area than in CUs of sustainable use in the Tapajós River. Besides, 

fishermen from CUs take less time and labor to caught the same quantity of fish than those 

from the unprotected area. These results are the first evidence that the conditions provided 

by CUs act synergistically to reduce the levels of fishing and increase the density of target 

fish in the Amazon Basin, reinforcing the importance of these protected areas to sustain the 

socio-ecological systems of small-scale fisheries in the Brazilian Amazon. However, a 

great proportion of fish used by fishermen are migratory species (eg. B. rousseauxii, B. 

filamentosum and S. insignis), which may need broader CUs or a network of protected 

areas. On the other hand, the biological parameters of fish assemblages in the floodplain 

lakes were more correlated with environmental factors than with the CUs. These results 

were similar to those found in fish landings from lakes. The CPUE of fishermen in 

floodplain lakes did not differ between protected and unprotected areas. Differences in 

fishing pressure between the floodplain lakes and the main river channel and also the effect 

of small-scale management (co-management) that occur in some lakes may partially 

explain such  absence of effect of CU on fish assemblages in floodplain lakes. Anyhow, 

the environmental variation between lakes create different association of fish species in 

floodplains and therefore these variables must be considered in management and 

conservation program in tropical rivers.

CONSIDERAÇÕES FINAIS 

 

 Apesar dos ambientes de água doce estarem entre os ecossistemas mais ameaçados 

no planeta pelas atividades humanas (Saunders et al., 2002; Abell et al., 2008), existem 

poucas informações e áreas protegidas voltadas a conservar este tipo de ambiente. Entre as 

UC existentes que incluem ecossistemas aquáticos, a grande maioria foi criada e delineada 

em primeiro lugar para a proteção de ecossistemas terrestres (Rodríguez-Olarte et al., 

2011). Consequentemente, a maior parte dos ecossistemas de água doce são protegidos de 

forma fragmentada, sem nenhuma confiabilidade quanto a sua efetividade frente a 

distúrbios antrópicos (Nel et al., 2007; Gaston et al., 2008; Abraão e Kelkar, 2012). Na 

Amazônia, a pesca vem sendo considerada como uma das principais atividades humanas 

influenciando a assembleia de peixes (Santos and Santos, 2005; Castello et al., 2013b). De 

acordo com as nossas informações, este é o primeiro trabalho que buscou investigar a 

intensidade e efeito da pesca em áreas protegidas e não protegidas na Amazônia.  

Os resultados levantados pelo nosso estudo indicaram que, como esperado pela 

hipótese 1, áreas protegidas sofrem menor pressão de pesca do que área não protegidas. 

Além disso, os pescadores de comunidades ribeirinhas dentro das UC em média gastaram 

menos tempo e menos trabalho (CPUE maior) para capturar a mesma quantidade de peixe 

do que pescadores localizados fora das UCs, corroborando a nossa hipótese 2. Portanto, as 

condições fornecidas pelas UCs no Rio Tapajós (menor densidade humana, regras de 

manejo mais restritas) parecem atuar sinergicamente para reduzir os níveis de pesca, 

aumentando assim a densidade de peixes de interesse pesqueiro.  Estes resultados reforçam 

o papel das UCs na conservação dos estoques pesqueiros, em um período de descrédito e, 

consequentemente, de desoficialização e diminuição das UCs a nível global (Mascia and 

Pailler, 2011; Ferreira et al., 2014; Mascia et al., 2014).  

O papel de UC para a proteção da ictiofauna depende em última estância da 

capacidade de movimentação da espécie frente ao tamanho da área protegida (Palumbi, 

2004). Espécies que apresentam grande deslocamento e que atravessam as bordas de UC 

com frequência tendem a ser menos protegidas pela UC do que aquelas que apresentam 

menor deslocamento e que conseguem complementar todo o seu ciclo de vida dentro da 

área protegida.  Nesse sentido, tanto a FLONA quanto a RESEX sozinhas podem não ser 

capazes de assegurar a exploração pesqueira a longo prazo, visto que boa parte dos 

desembarques das comunidades ribeirinhas do baixo Tapajós incluí espécies que realizam 



50 
 

migrações de longa distância (ex: B. rousseauxii, B. filamentosum e S. insignis). Portanto, 

é sugerido que seja criando redes de UC em pontos estratégicos de reprodução e 

alimentação em uma escala ampla, assegurando a conexão entre essas diferentes áreas.  

É evidenciado a necessidade de novos estudos para compreender o papel das UC 

como área fonte de pescado para áreas não protegidas. Este processo, conhecido como 

“spillover effect”, é bem conhecido e almejado em unidades de conservação marinhas 

(Roberts et al. 2001). Entretanto, em ambientes de água doce, existe uma clara lacuna de 

informações, o qual poderia reforçar o papel de UCs de água doce, não só como importante 

ferramenta de conservação, mas também de aumento de lucros para as comunidades 

ribeirinhas adjacentes.    

As coletas de peixes feitas nos lagos de planície de inundação estiveram mais 

correlacionadas com fatores ambientais do que com o efeito das UCs.  Este resultado é 

corroborado quando os desembarques pesqueiros oriundos dos lagos são analisados 

seperadamente, os quais mostram valores de CPUE de pescadores similares entre áreas 

protegidas e desprotegidas.  Profundidade e suas variáveis correlacionadas (pH, zona 

eufótica e condutividade), cobertura de habitat e morfologia do habitat (tamanho e forma) 

influenciaram a biomassa, riqueza, abundância, tamanho e nível trófico dos peixes. A falta 

de relação encontrada entre as assembleias de peixe de lagos e as UCs é possivelmente 

causada pelas diferenças na pressão pesqueira entre o rio e os lagos marginais. Cerca de 

67% de todos os peixes capturados pelos pescadores foram originados do canal principal 

do Rio Tapajós. Dessa forma, os impactos causados pela pesca seriam mais evidentes no 

canal principal do rio do que nos lagos marginais. Não obstante, o manejo de pequena 

escala (co-manejo), que ocorre em cinco lagos da região (dois na área não protegida, um 

na FLONA e dois na RESEX; Hallwass et al., in press), pode ter diminuído os impactos 

pesqueiros incidentes sobre a assembleia de peixes das áreas protegidas e não protegidas 

no baixo Tapajós. De qualquer forma, os resultados obtidos nesse trabalho indicam que a 

variação ambiental entre os lagos de planície de inundação cria diferentes associações de 

espécies de peixe no espaço e no tempo e portanto essas variáveis devem ser levadas em 

conta em qualquer plano de manejo na Amazônia.
