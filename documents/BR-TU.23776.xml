ABSTRACT: Magmatism associated with the Alto Paranaíba 
structural high comprises kimberlites, kamafugites, and alkaline 
complexes, forming an approximately 400  x 150  km NW?SE belt 
in the southern São Francisco Craton. Dating of some intrusions 
reveals ages between 120 and 75  Ma. Chemical analyses of garnet 
recovered in alluvium from traditional diamond digging areas indi?
cate peridotitic garnet windows in Três Ranchos and Coromandel. 
Six hundred and eighty (680) diamonds acquired or recovered during 
mineral exploration in the digging areas of Romaria, Estrela do Sul, 
Três Ranchos and Coromandel show unique characteristics, certain 
populations indicating young, proximal and primary sources (YPP). 
Analyses of 201 stones from Santo Antônio do Bonito, Santo Inácio 
and Douradinho rivers alluvium, Coromandel, present no evidence 
of transport, characterizing a proximal source. Within these river 
basins, exposures of the Late Cretaceous Capacete Formation basal 
conglomerate contain mainly small rounded and/or angular quartzite 
pebbles and of basic and ultrabasic rocks, as well as kimberlite miner?
als (garnet, ilmenite, spinel, sometimes diamond). A magnetotelluric 
profile between the Paraná and Sanfranciscana basins shows that the 
thick underlying lithosphere in the Coromandel region coincides 
with the peridotitic garnet window and with a diamond population 
displaying proximal source characteristics. Diamond?bearing kim?
berlite intrusions occur in different areas of Alto Paranaíba.

INTRODUCTION

According to Barbosa (1991), Francisco Machado da 
Silva found the first diamond in Brazil in 1714. The stone 
was recovered in the São Pedro gold mining, in Machado 
or Pinheiro stream, near the current town of Diamantina. 
The chronology of the discoveries in other regions of Minas 
Gerais or the colony is not clear. In many cases, diamonds 
appeared on the same occasion in different places of Minas 
Gerais or even in other areas of the country. Between 1764 
and 1781, diamonds were recovered in the regions of Abaeté 
and Itacambiruçu Valley, in Grão Mongol. In the nineteenth 
century, especially between 1830 and 1840, diamond depos?
its were explored in Chapada Diamantina, Bahia. The region 
became famous for the production of carbonados, which are 
porous aggregates of gray or black micro diamonds. The car?
bonado Sérgio, weighing 3,167 carats, was found in Lençóis 
in 1895 (Franco 1981; Barbosa 1991). Still in the nineteenth 
century, deposits were discovered in the Bagagem River, west 
of Coromandel. It was in the alluvial deposits of this river that 
the 261.88?carat South Star diamond was found in 1853, and 
the 119.5?carat Dresden diamond was found four years later 
(Franco 1981; Machado &amp;amp; Figuerôa 1999). Between 1937 
and 1943, diamonds over 200 carats were recovered to the 
east and southeast of Coromandel, more precisely in the allu?
vial deposits of the Santo Antônio do Bonito, Santo Inácio 
and Douradinho rivers, including the 726?carat Presidente 
Vargas, considered the largest one discovered in Brazil (Fig. 1) 
(Franco 1981; Barbosa 1991; Machado &amp;amp; Figuerôa 1999).

Most of the diamonds produced in the San Francisco 
Craton are probably from valley alluvium and terraces asso?
ciated with the current drainage. Small productions were or 
are coming from the Mesoproterozoic conglomerates of the 
Sopa?Brumadinho Formation, in the Diamantina region, 
and from the Cretaceous conglomerates in Romaria. In the 
latter, the contribution of kimberlitic material such as rock 
fragments, minerals, and diamond is such that the diamond 
recovery is considered to be characteristic of kimberlite. 
In the Chapada Diamantina region, the diamonds recov?
ered in the alluviums are directly associated with the erosion 
of the diamond?bearing conglomerates of the Tombador 
and Morro do Chapéu Formations, similarly to that of the 
Salobro Formation of the Rio Pardo Group, located about 
50 km west of Canavieiras, South Bahia (Pereira 2007).

Although without economic potential, other dia?
mond?bearing units in the São Francisco Craton 
are the Carboniferous Santa Fé Formation (Campos 
1992), the Neoproterozoic Jequitaí and Samburá Formations 
and parts of the Neoproterozoic Ibiá (Gonzaga et al. 1994) 
and Macaúbas (Karfunkel et al. 2001) groups.

Kimberlite occurs in the northern and southern portions 
of the São Francisco Craton (Fig. 2) (Pereira 2007). In the 
northern portion, the intrusions are located in the Serrinha 
and Gavião blocks. The Braúna 03 kimberlite, classified as 
diopside?phlogopite kimberlite and located in the Braúna 
province, in the central Serrinha block, has been dated at 
682 ± 20 Ma (Rb?Sr on phlogopite). In the Gavião block, the 
kimberlites are located near Barra do Mendes, close to the area 
of influence of the extensive Barra do Mendes?João Correa 
lineament that divides the Chapada Diamantina into east 
and west structural domains. The Rb?Sr dating on phlogopite 
of the Salvador 01 kimberlite provided an age of 1,152 Ma 
(Williamson &amp;amp; Pereira 1991; Pereira &amp;amp; Fuck 2005). Although 
sub?economic, the Salvador 01 kimberlite contains diamond. 
Recent evaluations of the Braúna 03 kimberlite indicate mine 
opening in this body (Donatti Filho et al. 2013a, b).

Unlike the Proterozoic kimberlites from the northern 
portion of the craton with predominant kimberlites over 
related rocks, the intrusions of the southern portion show 
Early and Late Cretaceous ages with widely predominant 
kamafugites over kimberlites.

Chemical analyses of kimberlite minerals recovered from 
alluvial sampling in the areas affected by Cretaceous magma?
tism in the southwestern portion of the São Francisco Craton, 
covering parts of Minas Gerais, São Paulo, and Goiás, allow 
delimiting peridotitic garnet windows, mainly of G9 lher?
zolitic?type, the pressure values of which, at the time of crystal?
lization, are compatible with those of the diamond formation 
stability field, recorded in thick lithosphere. Geochemical data 
of minerals from the several kimberlite clusters found in the

garnet window outlined in the Coromandel region evidence 
that the mantle at the time of intrusion presented tempera?
tures between 960 and 1,200oC and minimum garnet pres?
sure values between 41 and 50 kbar. Comparison of garnet 
pressure values with data of clinopyroxene recovered from the 
kimberlite clusters indicate geothermal gradients of approx?
imately 37–43 mW/m2 for SCL6 and DDO4 kimberlites 
(Pereira 2007). The high temperatures recorded in clinopy?
roxene reflect probably local little depleted lherzolitic mantle, 
suggesting that, aside of Mesozoic mantle fertilization, the 
possibility of little depleted mantle should also be consid?
ered in the region. According to Gurney (1984), just 15% of 

peridotitic garnet inclusions in diamond correlate with lher?
zolitic garnet (or G9), whereas in global scale 85% of peri?
dotitic garnet inclusions are of Ca?poor, Cr?rich harzburgitic 
(G10) type. Also, studies on the origin of diamonds recovered 
in mineral exploration campaigns or acquired in the differ?
ent diggings show different characteristics. Some populations 
indicate YPP sources (Robinson 1991; Robinson et al. 1995; 
Pereira 2007). In the specific case of the alluvial diamond batch 
recovered in the Santo Antônio do Bonito, Santo Inácio, and 
Douradinho rivers, about 90% of the stones display no signs 
of transport, which together with the 12 diamonds present?
ing fragile or twinned forms suggest local primary sources.

The objective of this work was to point out and address 
details observed in the studied region in Minas Gerais, to 
suggest local/proximal sources for the unique diamond pop?
ulation found in the alluvial deposits of the Santo Antônio 
do Bonito, Santo Inácio and Douradinho rivers.

GEOLOGICAL AND 
STRUCTURAL SETTING

The evolution of the São Francisco Craton is marked 
by Paleoproterozoic orogeny, responsible for the amalgam 
and deformation of different Archaean blocks (Barbosa &amp;amp; 
Sabaté 2002, 2004; Alkmim &amp;amp; Teixeira 2017; Teixeira et al. 
2017). The relatively stable geotectonic unit, comprising 
Paleoproterozoic and Archaean terrains, was partially reworked 
during the Brasiliano Orogeny in the Neoproterozoic. 
Polyphasic histories of the terrains are common in the north?
ern and southern portions of the craton (Pereira 2007).

The crystallization and preservation of diamonds until their 
capture by kimberlite and/or lamproite require the presence of 
a thick, relatively cold, refractory, low?density peridotitic root 
isolated from heating and tectonic reworking (Haggerty 1986). 
These requirements are found in most Archaean terrains little 
affected by processes such as plumes, volcanism recurrence in 
extensional regimes, and collisions that destroy the favorable 
mantle regions under the Archaean?Paleoproterozoic cratons. 
The identification of such terrains is important in the explo?
ration of diamond?bearing kimberlite.

Although it is not possible to establish a precise and 
continuous boundary between the reworked and preserved 
Archaean terrains in the southern portion of the São Francisco 
Craton, certain evidence allows to point out the least affected 
core during the Neoproterozoic Orogeny. This portion of the 
craton is characterized by the presence of Archaean terrains 
consisting of partially migmatized orthogneiss and sequences 
of volcano?sedimentary rocks developed between 3,200 and 
2,700 Ma. Apparently, between 2,160 and 2,000 Ma, the 
edges of this set of rocks were partially reworked and incor?
porated in the Mineiro Belt, developed into an arch?shaped 
belt around the Archaean core (Alkmim &amp;amp; Marshak 1998) 
(Fig. 3). Numerous intrusions related to the evolution of 
the Mineiro Belt aged between 2,200 and 2,000 Ma and 
occur along the belt. It appears that the reworking inflects 
northward, under the Bambuí Basin to the Januária region, 
where the gneiss outcrop is aged 2,710 ± 7 Ma, and non?de?
formed granite dated at 2,163 ± 13 Ma (Pereira 2007) is 
exposed. Paleoproterozoic ages are also recorded further north, 
in Correntina and São Domingos (Rendon &amp;amp; Kuyunjian 
2005). Therefore, the data suggest a basement composed of 
Paleoproterozoic?Archean terrains in the western portion 

of the São Francisco Craton, under the rocks of the Bambuí 
Basin. The craton boundary to the west corresponds to exten?
sive thrust faults marking the transition between the fold? 
and thrust belt involving basement and the sub?horizontal 
covers inside the craton during the Brasiliano Orogeny in 
the Neoproterozoic, when the closure of the basins gener?
ated the marginal Brasília Belt (Dardenne 2000; Fuck et al. 
2017). Seer et al. (2001, 2005) stated that the Araxá, Ibiá 
and Canastra groups, belonging to the southern sector of 
the Brasília Belt (Fuck 1994; Fuck et al. 2017) represent dis?
tinct tectonostratigraphic terrains, with no apparent genetic 
link, originated by tectonic transport of different geographic 
regions. The same authors classified these groups as tectonic 
slices formed of three types of terrain: 
1. Canastra terrain ? fragments of passive continental 

margin; 
2. Ibiá terrain ? fragments of a sedimentary portion of the 

volcanic arc; 
3. Araxá terrain ? fragments of oceanic crust intruded by 

collisional granites (Fig. 3). 

Apparently, the tectonic sheets formed of these terrains 
and thrown from west to east against the edge of the cra?
ton during the Brasiliano compression did not affect the 
Paleoproterozoic?Archean basement of the São Francisco 
Craton, except, perhaps, in the Araxá terrain, where crustal 
melting took place. This inference is supported by the occur?
rence of diamond?bearing intrusions in the region.

The extensive magmatism associated with the develop?
ment of the Alto Paranaíba structural high occurs along the 
Brasília Belt, from the Catalão region to the Passos Nappe or 
the southern end of the Bambuí Basin (Fig. 3) (Pereira 2007).

OBSERVATIONS ON THE 
ALTO PARANAÍBA, ASSOCIATED 
MAGMATISM, AND DIAMONDS

The Alto Paranaíba structural high, developed during 
the Mesozoic, divides the Paraná basin to the west and 
Sanfranciscana basin to the east. The main divide extends 
along the Brasília Belt; the northwest end borders Catalão 
while the southeast portion borders the vicinity of the Serra 
Negra intrusion. The extension caused by the arching probably 
moved the Brasiliano thrust/reverse faults along their planes, 
creating zones of magmatic permeability. Kimberlite and 
lamproite are usually located in such areas, characterized by 
successive intrusions of igneous rocks (Kaminsky et al. 1995). 
In certain cases, high permeability zones of the crust cor?
respond to elongated areas, where horst? and graben?type 
structures show evidence of the extensional regime.

The magmatism responsible for the occurrences of kim?
berlites, kamafugites and alkaline complexes, known as the 
Alto Paranaíba Igneous Province (Gibson et al. 1995), cov?
ers an approximate 400 x 150 km northwest?southeast ori?
ented band, in the southwest portion of the São Francisco 
Craton, where kamafugites largely predominate over kim?
berlites and alkaline complexes.

The quality of the lithospheric mantle in a given region 
can be monitored by analyzing the recovered minerals in the 
different volcanic pulses associated with the development of 
the system (O’Reilly &amp;amp; Griffin 1996). In the Alto Paranaíba 
region, the contrasting quality of the mantle sampled by 
kimberlite, aged between 120 and 90 Ma, compared to the 
Late Cretaceous kamafugites, aged between 85 and 75 Ma, 
indicates heating and thinning of the lithosphere in the area 
affected by the structural high. Pressure?temperature (P?T) 
results obtained on kimberlite?extracted clinopyroxene recov?
ered at the headwaters of the Abaeté, São Bento, and Indaiá 
rivers, near Carmo do Paranaíba and Lagoa Formosa, and in 
the Coromandel region, indicate sampling in mantle regions 
between 700 and 950°C, while kamafugite?source clinopy?
roxene shows temperatures of 800 and 1,200°C, substantially 
warmer than that recorded by recovered kimberlite?clinopy?
roxene. Therefore, in the approximate 5 Ma range, between 

90 and 85 Ma, about 250°C heating is observed in these 
regions (Read et al. 2003) (Figs. 4 and 5). Thus, comparisons 
of the mantle conditions obtained in successive kimberlite 
generations allow monitoring the evolution of the lithosphere 
and the diamond potential of a certain region (O’Reilly &amp;amp; 
Griffin 1996). According to Helmstaedt and Gurney (1994), 
information on lithospheric mantle conditions is also obtained 
by diamond abundance, garnet with high Cr2O3 and low 
CaO, and high Cr spinel (Cr&gt;  60% wt%) recovered in 
the intrusions. As mentioned before, local little depleted 
lherzolitic mantle in the region should not be discarded. 
The presence of such a mantle would explain the abundant 
dissemination of lherzolitic garnet in the Coromandel area.

The thinning of the lithosphere and consequent alteration 
of the diamond stability field due to temperature increase 
between the Early and Late Cretaceous in Alto Paranaíba is 
evident when the analysis results of minerals from kimberlites 
are also compared to the Late Cretaceous rocks intruded into 
stable Archaean terrains, where the underlying lithosphere is 
preserved. This is observed, for example, in the same southern 
portion of the São Francisco Craton, where the garnet forma?
tion pressure increases as the kimberlite intrusions move from 
reworked terrain to a preserved Archaean area, as shown by 
the red arrow in Figure 3. Even inside the Archean terrain, 

387

Rogério Silvestre Pereira et al.



mantle quality varies visibly as intrusions are placed more 
and more in the center of the preserved core. For example, 
analyses of Junco 01 kimberlite from Junco Province, aged 
82 ± 5 Ma (U?Pb in zircon), show 5% spinel of high inter?
est, 0.5% of subcalcic garnet and is negative for diamond, 
while the Maravilhas 03 kimberlite from the Maravilhas 
Province, aged 81 ± 2 Ma (Ar?Ar in garnet), indicates 30% 
spinel with high chromium, 6.3% of subcalcic garnet and a 
diamond content of 13.48 ct/100 t (Pereira 2007).

Mineral exploration programs in the Alto Paranaíba region 
identified primary sources of diamond?bearing alluvium, 
explored for years as digging areas. This fact is verified, for 
example, in the Vargem Bonita diggings in the high course 
of the São Francisco River, where alluvial sampling in the 
riverbed and different terraces along the diggings provided 
kimberlite minerals showing practically no signs of transport, 

and diamond with proximal source characteristics. Batches of 
diamonds recovered from alluvium and terraces along the 
diggings in material that originated from the Canastra 
01 kimberlite, located near the upstream Cachoeirinha 
stream tributary, show octahedron and dodecahedron?shaped 
crystallization and stone corrosion characteristics common 
to the two environments (Pereira 2007). The digging areas 
of Vargem Bonita stretch for about 35 km along the São 
Francisco River, starting from the Casca D’Antas waterfall. 
It is estimated that 500,000 carats were produced between 
the 1930s and ~2000. Preliminary data indicate an intrusion 
area of 1.9 hectares, while significant grades are restricted 
to 0.9 hectare. Evaluations indicated about 40 cts/100 t 
valued at US$ 150/ct. Systematic alluvial sampling per?
formed in every kilometer of the valley and in the tributar?
ies of both banks of the São Francisco River shows no new

As in the case of Vargem Bonita, diamond batches recov?

provided 49 stones with 0.037?carat average weight. The dia?
monds recovered from kimberlite are dominantly dodecahedral 
and octahedral colored stones, very similar to those recovered 
in the digging. Cubic diamonds represent 10% of the popu?
lation recovered in TRS 101, and 4% in TRS 102 intrusions. 
These kimberlites are considered the primary sources of the 
diamond diggings in the São Miguel River (Skinner 1996) 
and are, currently, being economically evaluated.

The diamond?bearing Três Ranchos 04 kimberlite (Fig. 8), 
aged 95 Ma, consists of a small intrusion, considered as one 
of the oldest discoveries in the region. Processing of 296 m3 
of rock material provided 371 diamonds. About 50% of the 
stones are described as gray and black in color and 30% as 
lighter?colored cubes, typical samples of mantle regions at the 
limit of the diamond stability field, around 44 kb pressure 
and about 1,000°C temperature. Analyses of recovered garnets 
indicate pressure values of at least 51 kbar (Pereira 2007).

In 1868, a diamond discovery on the banks of a small 
affluent stream of the Bagagem River gave origin to the mine 
and the village known as Água Suja, currently, the town of 

Romaria. The discovery site and the small stream are pres?
ently within the Romaria urban site (Fig. 3).

Svisero et al. (1981) and Fleischer (1998) described the 
geological features in the area around the mine. The authors 
refer that diamonds occur in a polymictic conglomer?
ate containing blocks up to 80 cm in diameter and little 
rounded pebbles of micaschist, phyllite, quartzite, metaba?
site, Botucatu sandstone and basalt. Locally, the Tauá con?
glomerate is deposited on the aeolian Botucatu sandstone, 
which, in turn, covers discordantly the underlying Araxá 
Group micaschists and intrusive granites that serve as base?
ment in the area (Fig. 9). The Tauá conglomerate is cov?
ered by another polymictic conglomerate called Secondina, 
which contains less diamond, smaller pebbles and has max?
imum thickness of 3 m, and which is probably the result of 
erosion of the Tauá conglomerate and subsequent deposi?
tion. The conglomerates are covered with a homogeneous 
succession composed of fine? and coarse?grained greenish 
sandstones, associated in this region of Minas Gerais with 
Late Cretaceous volcanic activity. Finally, the entire area is

covered with unconsolidated Tertiary material formed of 
laterite, sandstone pebbles, laterized conglomerate blocks 
and clays (Pereira 2007).

Exposure of the working front of the Água Suja mine 
allowed Draper (1911), who already knew kimberlites in South 
Africa, to describe the geological units in detail. The good 
local exposure shows that the basal portion is composed of 
micaschist containing staurolite, garnet, rutile, tourmaline, 
cut in all directions by pegmatite veins and intrusions of 
mafic rock metamorphosed to amphibolite. According to 
Draper (1911), the conglomerate or breccia, with a maxi?
mum thickness of 13 m, rests discordantly on the basement 
and local intrusions, as well as on the sandstone. The unit is 
formed of angular or little?rounded fragments of basic igne?
ous rock, granite, quartz, shale, and sandstone, cemented by 
red clay. Layers and masses of opal are observed in the con?
glomerate. Diamond, pyrope, perovskite, magnetite, ilmen?
ite, and olivine occur in the clayey material that cement the 
fragments. According to the author, the conglomerate layer 
or breccia, as well as the minerals present, is of local origin.

Currently, the GAR Mineração company investigates the 
area of the former Água Suja mine. With the geologist and 
company director, Juliano Magalhães Macedo, we examined 
drill core samples and visited work fronts, where material is 
extracted for processing and diamond recovery. The high 
contribution of kimberlite fragments is noted in the material 
and, according to Juliano Macedo, thin layers, which are char?
acteristic structures of epiclastic kimberlite, are observed in 
certain work fronts. The drill core samples represent a typical 
breccia in which kimberlite fragments examined under mag?
nifying glass show abundant ilmenite and/or spinel (Fig. 10).

Based on the treatment plant recovery, Svisero and 
Meyer (1989) reported that the diamond content in the con?
glomerate ranged between 0.04 and 0.12 ct/m3. A studied 

batch of 5,317 stones weighed 450 carats, corresponding to 
0.084?carat average weight. The dominant shape is rhom?
bododecahedron, followed by cube, octahedron and octa?
hedron?rhombododecahedron combination. In Romaria, 
De Beers purchased a batch of 39 diamonds that weighed 
3,508 carats, a 0.09?carat average weight. The diamonds were 
dominantly rounded dodecahedron and octahedron, while 
cube?shaped stones were between 10 and 15% (Robinson 
1991; Robinson et al. 1995). According to the authors, the 
batch can be described as a mixture composed of cubic and 
dodecahedral stones of gray color, similar to the population 
from Três Ranchos 04 kimberlite and a distinct population, 
comprising mainly rounded dodecahedra. Abrasion is not 
evident, which could suggest either distal sources of dia?
monds transported under low energy systems (Robinson 
1991) or, as indicated by other evidence, a YPP source of 
diamonds. Systematic sampling and concentrates analyzed 
in Romaria digging areas indicated garnet with pressure val?
ues of about 48 kbar and spinel grains typical of inclusions 
in diamonds (Fig. 11) (Pereira 2007).

The identification of diamond?bearing kimberlite in dif?
ferent areas of Alto Paranaíba makes it clear that kimber?
lite intrusions, especially of the Early Cretaceous, sampled 
mantle regions favorable to the crystallization and preser?
vation of diamond.

The Três Ranchos 04, Três Ranchos 101, 102, 104 kim?
berlites and the primary source of Água Suja diamond in 
Romaria, responsible for the cubic diamond populations in 
the region, intruded into the Araxá Group terrain, where 
Neoproterozoic intrusions of collisional granites indicate 
crustal melting. This fact may be an indication that the 
Paleoproterozoic?Archaean lithosphere has undergone some 
alteration at the western edge of the São Francisco Craton, 
favoring crystallization of cubic diamond (Pereira 2007).

BASAL CONGLOMERATE 
OF CAPACETE FORMATION, 

MATA DA CORDA GROUP

As mentioned above, the development of Alto Paranaíba 
structural high in the Mesozoic was responsible for magmatic 
events, comprising kimberlites, kamafugites, carbonatites 
and related rocks, which constitute hundreds of individual 
intrusions along an approximately 400?km?long north?
west?southeast trending belt. The sedimentary?magmatic 
sequence occurring along the Brasília Belt and the edges 
of the Paraná and Sanfranciscana basins is, to some extent, 
limited by the development of the extensional regime, where 
horst and graben are characteristic structures in the evolu?
tion of linear structural highs.

The basal conglomerate of the Capacete Formation (Sgarbi 
et al. 2001), or Tauá as it is known in Romaria, is widespread 
in the Alto Paranaíba. The deposition occurred on a rug?
ged relief, where paleo channels and lowered blocks along 
normal faults are recorded in the Araxá Group micaschist 
and/ or in the Botucatu sandstone that discordantly cov?
ers the Proterozoic rocks of this group in Romaria (Fig. 9). 

Exposures along the work fronts during diamond explo?
ration in the old Água Suja mine allowed Draper (1911) 
and Svisero et al. (1981) to observe rocks and their contact 
relationships in loco. Thus, Draper (1911) concluded that 
the conglomerate or breccia layer, and the minerals present 

are of local origin. The author enumerates some facts for 
this assertion: 

 ? The Tauá conglomerate, local name for the conglomer?
ate, is composed of rocks found in situ, underlying por?
tions of the conglomerate layer itself.

 ? Fragments of the rocks that make up the conglomerate 
are angular, indicating little transport. 

 ? Occurrence of conglomerate blocks within the Botucatu 
sandstone, whose deposition extended from the 
Triassic?Jurassic to the beginning of the Cretaceous, 
showing the contemporaneity of the two units in the 
final deposition phase of the Botucatu sandstone. 

 ? The deep weathering observed in every Tauá layer can?
not be attributed to the infiltration of surface water. 
Besides the intense decomposition of the layer, the igne?
ous rocks of the local basement are also totally altered. 

The age of the intrusion could not be determined because 
the kimberlite conduit was not found; however, intrusions 
in the local stratigraphy indicate an Early Cretaceous age 
for the hidden body.

On eastern Alto Paranaíba, the western border of the 
Sanfranciscana Basin, the crater facies of the X?270 kim?
berlite, dated at 89.5 ± 3.4 Ma, shows sandstone clasts, 
and quartz and feldspar grains, confirming the presence 
of semi?consolidated sediments from the Early Cretaceous 
Areado Group (Fig. 4) (Read et al. 2003).

Figure 11. Analyses of heavy mineral concentrates recovered from conglomerates and digging areas in Romaria: 
(A) garnet, (B) spinel (Pereira 2007). Higher Cr2O3 concentrations in garnet correspond to equilibrium conditions 
in greater depths within the lithosphere mantle and consequently higher pressures.

Evidence of YPP diamond source in Coromandel, MG



The basal conglomerate of the Capacete Formation is 
exposed in several parts of the structural high, with thick?
ness varying between 15 and 20 m (Fernandes et al. 2014). 
In Romaria, the maximum thickness is 13 m, consisting of 
boulders and angular pebbles of micaschist, phyllite, quartz?
ite, metabasite, granite and Botucatu sandstone, cemented by 
clayey material containing diamond, garnet, perovskite, mag?
netite, ilmenite and olivine (Draper 1911; Svisero et al. 1981; 
Fleischer 1998). The larger or smaller presence of quartzite, 
sandstone and siltstone pebbles and other Proterozoic rocks 
vary according to the bedrock or rocks of the Araxá, Ibiá and 
Canastra groups underlying the conglomerate. Angular peb?
bles and/or fragments of volcanic rocks, as well as kimberlite 
minerals, bordered by alteration or with a keliphitic corona, 
characteristic of little transport, are frequently found in out?
crops close to intrusions inferred beneath the conglomerate.

The old digging known as Canastrel, between the Santo 
Antônio do Bonito and Santo Inácio rivers, was developed 
directly on the conglomerate. The exposed outcrop shows at least 
a 3?m?thick alternation between tuff and conglomerate mate?
rial. In some cases, the conglomerate grades to coarse?grained, 
commonly cross?laminated sandstone. Clasts of volcanic and 
Proterozoic rocks, about 20 cm in diameter, are present in the 
conglomerate layer. As in other outcrops, the top of the suc?
cession is covered by thick lateritic material. The brown matrix 
of the conglomerate bears altered feldspar and phlogopite 
(Karfunkel et al. 2014). Garnet and ilmenite mantled above 
50% by alteration material are recovered in the soil along the 
outcrop, meaning practically no transport. The clasts observed 
in the conglomerate diggings and in other exposures in the 
region do not show any sorting as to pebble size increase from 
the top to the base next to the bedrock (Fig. 12). According 
to Karfunkel et al. (2014), the last owner recovered 3 stones 
in the digging, weighing about 2 carats. Analyses of two of the 

stones indicated white and yellow colored, gem?type diamonds 
weighing 0.750 and 0.497 carats, respectively, and possibly 
dodecahedral (Karfunkel et al. 2014). As for surface features 
associated with transport, the authors reported absence of per?
cussion marks and severe breakage, reflecting completely differ?
ent transport and deposition histories from what is observed, 
for example, in Diamantina diamonds (Karfunkel et al. 2014). 
Although analyses of only two stones do not represent statistical 
data, the results are very similar to those obtained by Robinson 
et al. (1995) on 201 diamonds from alluvium of the Santo 
Antônio do Bonito, Santo Inácio and Douradinho rivers. Also, 
kimberlite ilmenite and garnet with keliphitic coronae or with 
almost intact alteration mantles were recovered in the Canastrel 
digging, indicating absence of transport (Karfunkel et al. 2014).

DIAMOND-BEARING ALLUVIUM

Recovery of diamond with other kimberlite minerals in 
alluvium does not imply in common primary source. As a 
rather robust mineral, diamonds resist to transport over large 
distances, being incorporated into sediments carried along 
different drainages by capture processes and, therefore, in the 
majority of cases, without any genetic link with the other kim?
berlite minerals present in the deposit. However, the agreement 
between certain localities of diamond and kimberlite occur?
rences in the San Francisco Craton is not random (Fig. 13).

Rogério Silvestre Pereira et al.



Detailed studies on diamond origin, alluvial deposits 
and analyses of thousands of kimberlite minerals show that 
diamonds contained in Cenozoic deposits in certain areas 
of the southern portion of the craton originate directly from 
identified primary sources. The diamonds contained in the 
Cretaceous Tauá conglomerates in Romaria and in the basal 
conglomerate of the Capacete Formation, in other areas of 
the Santo Antônio do Bonito, Santo Inácio and Douradinho 
river basins, are considered as originating directly from local 
primary sources, which were not properly located up to now 
(Pereira 2007).

As emphasized above, diamond?bearing kimberlites, 
especially those aged between 120 and 90 Ma, occur in 
different points of Alto Paranaíba, some of them constitut?
ing the primary sources of diamonds recovered in alluvial 
deposits associated with the current drainage and exploited 
as digging areas.

The peridotitic garnet window of high interest inferred 
in exploration of diamond?bearing kimberlite corresponds to 
kimberlite clusters located in the Coromandel region, some 
of which hidden beneath the conglomerate (Pereira 2007).

The main sources of alluvial diamond deposits in the drain?
age to the south and southeast of Coromandel, especially in 
the Santo Antônio do Bonito, Santo Inácio and Douradinho 
rivers, are the basal conglomerates of the Capacete Formation 
and rocks of the Araxá, Ibiá and Canastra groups, which serve 
as bedrock for the conglomerates (Fernandes et al. 2014; 
Karfunkel et al. 2014). Also, kimberlites of different ages, 
kamafugites and related rocks contributed to the formation 
of the alluvium associated to the current drainage. In certain 
diggings, it is possible to recognize fragments or pebbles of 
kimberlites with marked characteristics. For example, in the 
diggings of the Vendome Mines company, the small mounds 
of pebbles and fragments of extremely silicified kimberlite 
observed in the yard of the treatment plant, or “osso de boi” 
(“ox bone”) as called by the diggers, come from the erosion 
of an extensive strip of silicified kimberlite, consisting of 
dikes and blows, that extends for more than 10 km along 
the roughly north?south right bank of the Santo Antônio do 
Bonito River (Figs. 14 and 15). Currently, digging activities 
in the region are restricted to the river terraces, as it is for?
bidden to throw tailings in the active bed of the drainage.     

Among the rivers and tributary streams carrying the same 
diamond population in the region, the Santo Antônio do 
Bonito, Santo Inácio and Douradinho rivers are the most 
important ones. The largest diamonds in the country were 
found in this area (Fig. 16). The average value of the stones 
from Coromandel ranges from US$ 200.00 to US$  300.00/ ct 
(Pereira 2007).

The batch of 201 diamonds studied shows a unique char?
acteristic, totally different not only from the stones from the 

southern portion of the São Francisco Craton but also from 
other regions in Brazil. Typically, the stones are brown, occa?
sionally yellow or gray, and usually distorted. The rounded 
dodecahedron shape is the most common one, with no rem?
nants of octahedral and cubic faces. Finely spaced lamination 
lines and zig?zag patterns are quite common. About 90% 
of the diamonds do not show evidence of transport, a fact 
that, added to the 12 stones with fragile shapes or twinning, 
suggests proximal and primary source. The provenance study 
of this batch emphasizes that no peculiar differences were 
detected in any of the streams that indicated individual pop?
ulations. In addition, inclusion of silicates or olivine and 
garnet are rare, while sulfide was found only in two stones 
(Robinson et al. 1995; Pereira 2007).

The peridotitic garnet window of high interest inferred in 
exploration of diamond?bearing kimberlite and alluvium is 
corroborated by the magnetotelluric profile surveyed between 
the Paraná and Sanfranciscana basins (Bologna et al. 2006).

Evidence of YPP diamond source in Coromandel, MG



Archaean lithosphere base shows temperature and pressure 
ranging approximately between 900 and 1,200°C and 45 to 
65 kb, corresponding to depths between 150 and 300 km 
(Boyd et al. 1985; Haggerty 1986). Despite of the reduced 
area or extent of thick lithosphere, its presence is important 
because it indicates that the Archaean?Paleoproterozoic ter?
rain of the western border of the São Francisco Craton was 
characterized by thick lithosphere, capable of crystallizing 
and preserving diamond.

DISCUSSION

Probably from the Pleistocene to the Holocene, the 
large flat plateau area observed in the southwestern por?
tion of the São Francisco Craton that developed during 
Tertiary peneplanation in Brazil and South America started 
to undergo erosive processes. In this area, remains of the 
old surface showing the lateritic cover that character?
izes the top of the erosion surface can be seen. In some 
cases, the incision of the current drainage reaches the 
rocks of the Araxá, Ibiá and Canastra groups. The basal 
conglomerate of Capacete Formation, in a frank erosion 
process, is the main source of the diamond?bearing allu?
vium of the Santo Antônio do Bonito, Santo Inácio and 
Douradinho rivers. However, rocks of different ages from 
the magmatism associated with Alto Paranaíba also con?
tributed to the formation of alluvium. Observations of 
the diamond?bearing alluvium indicate only one high 
terrace level. Apparently, the region underwent little 
movement or block accommodation after the Tertiary, 
unlike, for example, the Serra da Canastra region, where 
the areas upstream of the Vargem Bonita digging, on the 
São Francisco River, show three distinct terrace levels. 
The pebble distribution in the alluvium is less chaotic, 
indicating currents with greater capacity to concentrate 
the dispersed diamond in the basal conglomerate of the 
Capacete Formation, considered as the secondary source 
of the diamond recovered to the south and southeast of 
Coromandel (Figs. 18 and 19). Despite all indications 
of source or local primary sources for the diamonds con?
tained in the conglomerate and concentrated in alluviums, 
such sources have not yet been located.

Certain factors, or the conjunction of factors, may hin?
der the location of certain intrusions in the region, espe?
cially of the potentially diamond?bearing Early Cretaceous 
kimberlites. The aeromagnetic survey conducted in the 
Coromandel region was considered a great success in 
terms of responses associated with intrusions. Thousands 
of anomalies compatible with kimberlite intrusions were 
selected and hundreds were positive in field follow?up, 

especially of kamafugites and related rocks intruded in 
the Late Cretaceous. The  Mata da Corda volcanism is 
extremely magnetic and capable of masking any under?
lying individual anomaly. For example, analysis of drill 
core samples from 56 selected anomalies, including the 
Omega 22 intrusion at the top of the Chapadão, the com?
mon source area of the Santo Antônio do Bonito, Santo

Inácio and Douradinho rivers, were classified as related to 
Late Cretaceous intrusions without potential for diamond. 
Another factor associated with the high magnetism of Mata 
da Corda volcanism that could also mask older intrusions 
would be the emplacement of intrusions in graben zones, 
where tens of meters of the conglomerate are covered by 
the volcanic rocks of the Late Cretaceous Mata da Corda 
Group, and in some cases by Tertiary deposits, resulting 
in a quite thick coverage over potentially diamond?bearing 
intrusions. Finally, a rarer, but not uncommon case, would 
be either little or non?magnetic kimberlite emplaced in the 
described situations (Fig. 20).

At the time of the systematic exploration conducted in 
the region, a gravimetric survey was considered, however 
the high cost of gravimetry associated with the size of the 
area made the project unfeasible.

Some studies should be carried out as an attempt 
to reduce the area for an eventual gravimetric survey in 
the southern and southeastern regions of Coromandel, 
as follows: 
1. Surveying all occurrences or outcrops of the basal con?

glomerate of the Capacete Formation.
2. Analyzing the frequency of angular fragments or peb?

bles of volcanic rocks, especially kimberlites, and the 
nature of the more or less sandy or clayey matrix of the 
outcrops.

3. Collecting at least 500 L of the material, with special 
care to avoid contamination.

4. Recovering the heavy minerals up to the panning level.
5. Analyzing specially garnet and spinel, and, in the case 

of diamond recovery, performing provenance studies.

The set of results could indicate more accurately the 
proximity to possible primary diamond sources, helping to 
define the most appropriate area for the gravimetric survey, 
or even for drilling, following a convenient grid of bore?
hole distribution if the reduced surveying area is compati?
ble with the cost.

CONCLUSION

Geological knowledge is cumulative and continually 
updated through research and collection of information 
inserted in a given context of paradigms.

In 1968, SOPEMI – Pesquisa e Exploração de Minérios 
S.A,, a joint venture between France’s BRGM (Bureau de 
Recherches Géologiques et Minières) and CAEMI (Antunes 
Group), discovered the first kimberlite in the Santo Inácio 
River, in the São Francisco Craton. In 1974, after the BRGM 
departure, the De Beers Group, which had joined SOPEMI, 
took control of the company. Since then, De Beers and 
other companies invested continuously for more than two 
decades in diamond prospecting in Brazil and other coun?
tries in South America, discovering hundreds of kimberlites 
and related rocks.

The main research focus was the São Francisco Craton, 
covering the digging areas in the regions of Lençóis, Andaraí, 
Mucugê in the Chapada Diamantina, in the northern por?
tion of the craton, but intensive work was also conducted in 
the traditionally producing areas of southwest Minas Gerais, 
in the southern portion of the craton.

Among the most used techniques worldwide to explore 
kimberlite and lamproite are the sampling and recovery of 
heavy minerals such as garnet, spinel, diopside and ilmen?
ite, followed by aerial or terrestrial geophysics and remote 
sensing. The combined data obtained using these techniques 
become important when searching for favorable targets of 
kimberlite intrusion. The data include petrology, mineral?
ogy, geochemistry, geochronology, geophysics, remote sens?
ing, and, if possible, additional field work, such as grain size 
and soil color variations, specific local anomalies of certain 
vegetation species and minerals identified in the waste of 
anthills or termite mounds.

In the region of Alto Paranaíba, an aeromagnetic sur?
vey was extremely effective, allowing the direct detection 
of hundreds of kimberlites and/or related rocks. The cov?
erage of the Coromandel area, with 8,520 km2, in three 
stages, allowed selecting 1,184 anomalies, which were

Evidence of YPP diamond source in Coromandel, MG



classified as grade 1, 2 and 3. Among the 986 tested, 
435 intrusions (44%) were proven, of which 120 (27.6%) 
correspond to already known kimberlites/related rocks 
(Skinner 1996; Pereira 2007). To reach these results, a lot of 
work had to be done to define the anomalies only in this area.  
Approximately 15,600 km/line, with 50 x 25 m intervals 
between the lines and stations and 100 x 50 m in the terres?
trial magnetometry survey, covered the 986 anomalies, clas?
sifying them as good (485), medium (211) and poor (290). 
Approximately 33,594 samples were collected, including 
22,161 soil, 7,750 alluvium, 3,080 drill cores, and 603 rock 
samples (Skinner 1996; Pereira 2007).

The São Francisco Craton exploration yielded two import?
ant results; it identified a thick lithosphere capable of crys?
tallizing and preserving diamond in the northern portion, 
and located diamond?bearing kimberlites in the southern 
portion of the craton.

The kimberlites of the Braúna Province, in the north 
portion of the craton, located in the Archean core of the 
central portion of the Serrinha Block, are diamondiferous 
(Pereira &amp;amp; Fuck 2005; Pereira 2007; Donatti et al. 2013a, b). 
The Salvador 01 kimberlite was also identified in Chapada 
Diamantina, Gavião Block, whose outcrops show low?grade 
metamorphism, hypabissal facies and phlogopite Rb?Sr age 
of 1,152 Ma. The kimberlite was considered at the time as 
sin deposition of the diamond?bearing conglomerate of the 
Tombador Formation. Subsequently, aeromagnetic survey 
in the region indicated anomalies northwest of Salvador 
01 (SVR 01). Drilling detected kimberlitic rocks at 246 
and 159 m in two anomalies. Drill cores show crater facies 
rocks, metamorphosed and placed at the base of the Morro 
do Chapéu Formation quartzites, therefore intrusive in 
the rocks that constitute the underlying Tombador and 
Caboclo formations. The findings indicate a time of intru?
sions younger than the primary sources that provided dia?
monds to the known diamondiferous Tombador Formation 
conglomerates (Pereira 2007).

In the south portion of the craton, the De Beers min?
eral exploration indicated the location of diamond?bear?
ing kimberlites, constituting, in some cases, the primary 
source of the diamonds extracted from the bed alluvium 
and terraces of certain streams. In addition to the identifi?
cation of diamond?bearing kimberlites in Alto Paranaíba, 
exploration also identified the conglomerate containing 
angular pebbles of basic and ultrabasic rocks, quartzites, 
shales and amphibolites, underlying the Mata da Corda 
Group. The conglomerate outcrops show distribution of 
pebbles without any sorting and deposition in rugged 
relief, where normal faults are common. Sampling of the 
conglomerate indicates in some places presence of abun?
dant garnet, spinel and ilmenite of high interest with 

kelifitic coronae or alteration mantles, comprising more 
than 50% of the mineral, implying in reduced transport 
or local origin.

More recent work has contributed significantly to 
the knowledge of the post?Gondwana stratigraphy in 
Alto Paranaíba (Sgarbi et al. 2001; Fernandes et al. 2014; 
Karfunkel et  al. 2014). In  addition to confirming the 
presence of diamond in the basal conglomerate of the 
Capacete Formation, the description of diamonds recov?
ered in the Canastrel digging, extracted directly from the 
conglomerate (Karfunkel et al. 2014), sheds light on the 
fact that the components of this formation constitute 
the secondary source of diamonds extracted in the allu?
vium of the Santo Antônio do Bonito, Santo Inácio and 
Douradinho rivers.

The presence of diamond?bearing kimberlites at different 
locations in the region and the identification of thick litho?
sphere capable of crystallizing and preserving diamond, asso?
ciated to the recovery of kimberlite minerals extracted directly 
from the conglomerate with characteristics of local origin, 
as well as diamonds with little transport, allow to strongly 
consider the presence of YPP sources, which eroded, fed the 
basal conglomerate of the Capacete Formation. These min?
erals, including diamond, were later reconcentrated in the 
alluvium of the Santo Antônio do Bonito, Santo Inácio and 
Douradinho rivers.
