Resumo 

O processo de destilação molecular reativa, no qual ocorre o acoplamento de destilação molecular e reação 

química simultaneamente, pode ser qualificado como um processo híbrido e também como um processo 

intensificado, dada a configuração do equipamento e as condições operacionais que viabilizam a implementação de 

alto vácuo (&lt;50 Pa), permitindo submeter o material a temperaturas adequadas num curto tempo operacional, 

garantindo um contato muito intenso da amostra com a superfície catalítica.  

Este trabalho teve como finalidade desenvolver a modelagem matemática e simulação do processo de 

destilação molecular centrífuga reativa (DMCR – em catálise heterogênea) baseada na descrição matemática descrita 

para o processo de destilação molecular centrífuga de frações pesadas de petróleo. Para a simulação, foi considerado 

como caso de estudo o processamento do resíduo atmosférico “ATR–W” 673,15 K
+
 com grau API igual a 11,9 e 

massa molar igual a 2956 kg·kmol-1. A modelagem e simulação foram realizadas nas condições de estado 
estacionário. O conjunto de (11+18N) equações diferenciais parciais e algébricas e (27+19N) variáveis foi 

incorporado no ambiente computacional, denominado DESTMOL-R, desenvolvido na linguagem FORTRAN–90 

usando o compilador Compaq Visual Fortran (professional edition 6.6). O sistema de equações formuladas no filme, 

ao longo da superfície cônica do evaporador, foi resolvido numericamente através do método das linhas. Condições 

de temperatura do evaporador entre 473.15K e 523.15 K e de porcentagem de catalisador (catalisador zeolítico 

regenerado de uma unidade de FCC) entre 3 e 5% m/m foram avaliadas.  

As variáveis de saída, tais como: a temperatura da superfície do filme (Ts), a espessura de filme (?), a taxa de 

evaporação efetiva (GE), o fluxo mássico de destilado (D), a velocidade radial (?r), a concentração de 

pseudocomponente "a" (Xa) e a conversão (?) foram calculadas através da análise dos efeitos das condições 

operacionais definidas como sendo: a temperatura do evaporador (EVT), a vazão de alimentação (Q), a porcentagem 

de catalizador (%CAT), a temperatura de alimentação (Tfeed), a temperatura do condensador (Tcond), a velocidade do 

rotor (RS) e a pressão do sistema (PS).  

Os resultados mostraram que as variáveis de entrada, tais como a temperatura do evaporador (EVT) e a 

porcentagem de catalisador (%CAT) são as condições operacionais de maior influência sobre a composição final do 

fluxo do condensado. A concentração do pseudocomponente “i” diminui nas direções –s e –r, devido ao aumento da 

temperatura nas camadas internas do filme líquido. Por conseguinte, a espessura do filme diminui rapidamente ao 

longo da superfície do evaporador, enquanto que a quantidade de destilado aumenta continuamente ao longo do 

evaporador às condições operacionais seleccionadas. Resultados obtidos das simulações apresentaram uma 

conversão da carga de 65.6% no destilado e de 49,6% no resíduo, considerando uma porcentagem de 3% m/m de 

catalisador na carga inicial e uma temperatura de processo de 483,15 K. As predições oriundas da simulação foram 

comparadas com os dados experimentais e indicaram um desvio relativo percentual médio menor do que 6,82%; 

9,39% e 14,92% para a taxa global de destilado, conversão na corrente de destilado e conversão na corrente de 

resíduo, respectivamente, o que é valioso, considerando-se a complexidade do processo e da mistura. Assim, o 

modelo desenvolvido mostrou-se adequado para descrever os processos de reação - separação na destilação 

molecular centrífuga reativa fornecendo orientação teórica para o desenvolvimento experimental e a futura 

otimização do processo.  

Por fim, o salto tecnológico em matéria computacional e experimental da DMCR concluiu em um efetivo 

desempenho do processo obtendo produtos com características favoráveis para os processos de exploração, 

escoamento, transporte e refino desde que: (i) mudanças importantes na fração analítica &gt;613,15 K foram reportadas  

nas correntes de destilado atingindo uma conversão do ATR-W 673,15 K
+
 superior a 64.3%, valores de grau API 

entre 19 e 21 e massa molar até 200 kg·kmol-1, e (ii) foram observadas alterações significativas nas frações analíticas 
&gt;613,15 K e &gt;813.15 K nas correntes de resíduo, atingindo uma conversão do ATR-W 673,15 K

+
 entre  8.0% e 

53.1%, valores de grau API aproximadamente iguais a 11,9 e massa molar entre 2570 kg·kmol-1 - 2908 kg·kmol-1.

Abstract 

The reactive molecular distillation process, in which, the molecular distillation process and reactive process 

occur simultaneously can be characterized like an intensified and hybrid process due to the particular features on the 

equipment configuration which lead to use higher vacuum (&lt;50 Pa), to keep the material inner the equipment with a 

short operational residence time, and to achieve a very intensive contact among the sample and catalytic surface. 

This work focuses mainly on the mathematical modeling and numerical simulation of centrifugal reactive 

molecular distillation process (CRMD – using heterogeneous catalysis) based on mathematical description of the 

centrifugal molecular distillation from high–boiling–point petroleum fractions. The computational case study 

illustrated was a 673.15 K
+
 high–boiling–point petroleum fraction of “W” crude oil (atmospheric residue ATR–W) 

with API gravity equals 11.9 and molar mass equals 2956 kg·kmol-1. The model and simulations were described at 
the steady–state conditions. A set of (11+18N) equations and (27+19N) variables were processed by the 

computational program named DESTMOL–R developed in FORTRAN–90 language using Compaq Visual Fortran 

compiler (professional edition 6.6). The system equations formulated inner the thin liquid film, along the evaporator 

surface, was numerically solved by the numerical method of lines. The process temperature (evaporator temperature) 

from 473.15 K to 523.15 K and the influence of adding a zeolite-based catalyst (regenerated catalyst used for FCC 

technology) between 3 and 5 %wt were examined. 

The output variables, such as the surface temperature (Ts), film thickness (?), effective evaporation rate (GE), 

distillate mass flow rate (D), radial velocity (?r), concentration of pseudocomponent “a” (Xa) and the conversion 

degree (?) profiles, were computed by analyzing the effects of the operational conditions (the evaporator temperature 

(EVT), feed flow rate (Q), percent weight of catalyst (%CAT), feed temperature (Tfeed), condenser temperature (Tcond), 

rotor speed (RS) and the system pressure (Ps)).  

Results showed that the inlet variables such as the evaporator temperature (EVT) and the weight percent of 

catalyst (%CAT) are the most suitable operating conditions into the final composition of the condensate flow. The 

concentration of the pseudocomponent “i” shrinks in both s– and r– directions, due to the fast increase of the 

temperature in the thin liquid film. Consequently, the thickness of the film rapidly decreases in this region, whereas 

the amount of the distillate of the split molecules continuously increases along the evaporator at the selected 

operating conditions. Simulated data indicated a conversion equal to 49.6% of feedstock in the residue stream and 

65.6% of feedstock in the distillate stream when considered 3 wt% of catalyst and an evaporator temperature (EVT) 

equals 483.15 K. The simulated results agree well with those obtained by the experimental study, indicating the 

accuracy and reliability of the mathematical model since the average percent error was no larger than 6.82%, 9.39% 

and 14.92% for the distillate flow rate, extent conversion in the distillate rate and in the residue stream, respectively. 

It can be concluded that the mathematical model can describe the reaction – split processes in the CRMD 

process providing theoretical guidance for the further experimental runs and process optimization. Finally, the 

technological leap in the computational and experimental exercises of the CRMD process concluded in an effective 

performance of the process obtaining products with favorable characteristics for exploration, flow, transport and 

refining processes since: (i) important changes in the &gt;613.15 K analytical fraction were reported in the distillate 

stream reaching a conversion of the ATR–W 673.15 K
+
 higher than 64.3%, values of API gravity between 19 – 21 

and molar mass up 200 kg·kmol-1, and (ii) significant changes were found in the &gt;613.15 K and &gt;813.15 K 
analytical fractions of the residue streams, reaching a conversion of the ATR–W 673.15 K

+
 between 8.0 and 53.1%, 

values of API gravity approximately equal to 11.9 and molar mass between 2570 kg·kmol-1  – 2908 kg·kmol-1.

Capítulo 1 

Introdução e objetivos 

1.1.     Introdução 

A American Society for Testing and Materials, ASTM D 4175 define o óleo cru ou 

petróleo como: uma mistura de ocorrência natural, consistindo predominantemente de 

hidrocarbonetos e derivados orgânicos sulfurados, nitrogenados e oxigenados, metais dentre 

outros (ASTM, 2009).  

Sendo o petróleo um elemento de extrema importância para o mundo, pois dele são 

extraídas matérias–primas que irão atender diversos setores da indústria, no caso específico da 

indústria Brasileira, existem alguns aspectos para salientar: 

1. Conforme apresentado nas Figuras 1a – 1c, tendo como base o ano 2001, as reservas 

provadas de petróleo nacional apresentaram um notável crescimento nos últimos dez anos 

quando comparado com o crescimento das reservas de outros países ou grupo econômico no 

mesmo período (ANP, 2011).  

2. Em 2010, a produção brasileira de petróleo (Figura 1d), incluindo óleo cru e condensado, 

mas excluindo líquido de gás natural e óleo de xisto, chegou a 750 milhões de barris, o que 

elevou o Brasil à 12ª colocação no ranking mundial de produtores de petróleo (ANP, 2011). 

3. Sendo a densidade °API (do inglês API gravity – ASTM D 4175 (2009)) um parâmetro de 

classificação através da qual o petróleo é considerado como extra–leve (40&lt;°API&lt;45), leve 

(35&lt;°API&lt;40), médio (25&lt;°API&lt;35), pesado (20&lt;°API&lt;25), ultra–pesado (15&lt;°API&lt;20) ou 

asfáltico (°API&lt;15), os petróleos nacionais podem ser classificados como médio (16%), 

pesado (62%) e ultra–pesado (12%) somando um 90% da produção no Brasil em 2010, sendo 

um 10% classificado como petróleo leve, extra–leve e asfalto (Figura 2). Portanto, o 

panorama compreende uma predominância do petróleo pesado apresentando alta viscosidade 

e baixa mobilidade nos reservatórios, o que dificulta sua extração, bem como seu 

processamento (Guimarães e Pinto, 2007; Parisotto, 2007).  



2 

Logo, a ocorrência de petróleos pesados e ultra–pesados aponta para a necessidade de 

desenvolvimento de novas tecnologias que contribuam para o aprimoramento do processo de 

caracterização e processamento do petróleo e suas frações, sejam elas pesadas.

Hoje são realizados investimentos em diferentes áreas da indústria de petróleo e 

pesquisa para o desenvolvimento de novas tecnologias com o objetivo de aprimorar e tornar mais 

ágil o processo de exploração, produção e caracterização do petróleo, frações, cortes e derivados. 

Os investimentos em tecnologia na área de petróleo vêm em alta e são imprescindíveis tanto para 

viabilizar a produção do petróleo disponível nas reservas brasileiras como para o refino desse 

petróleo com características físico–químicas diferentes dos petróleos encontrados em outras 

regiões. Esse crescimento levou à implantação de inúmeras empresas nesse setor e o 

desenvolvimento de projetos de pesquisa e engenharia, que apresentam um viés tecnológico, a 

fim de garantir uma melhora no rendimento e qualidade do óleo, aumentando a competitividade 

do setor petrolífero do Brasil. 

A PETROBRAS que é movida pelos desafios, por incentivar o desenvolvimento e 

garantir o futuro da sociedade competitiva, vem enfrentando a tarefa de produzir combustíveis de 

alta qualidade, a partir do óleo pesado brasileiro produzido nos campos petrolíferos em 

quantidades consideráveis.  

Tendo a empresa como objetivo imediato aumentar a conversão de resíduo, reduzir 

gastos com óleo importado e aumentar a produção de derivados de maior valor agregado a partir 

do petróleo pesado, muitos processos já foram desenvolvidos, aprimorados e/ou aperfeiçoados. 

Dentro deles, destaca–se o caso específico dos estudos realizados nos Laboratórios de 

Desenvolvimento de Processos de Separação (LDPS) e de Otimização, Projeto e Controle 

Avançado (LOPCA) da Faculdade de Engenharia Química (FEQ) da Universidade Estadual de 

Campinas (UNICAMP), em parceria com o órgão Financiador de Estudos e Projetos do 

Ministério da Ciência e Tecnologia (FINEP) e o Centro de Pesquisa CENPES/PETROBRAS que 

desenvolveram uma tecnologia, a destilação molecular, que permite obter cortes e resíduos 

pesados de petróleo a temperaturas superiores daquelas alcançadas pelos métodos padronizados 

ASTM D 2892 (2005) e ASTM D 5236 (2003). Resultados do desenvolvimento permitiram 

caracterizar de uma forma mais completa o petróleo, no que se refere à extensão da curva do 

Ponto de Ebulição Verdadeiro (PEV) a temperaturas próximas a 973,15 K (Tabela 1).

Hoje a realidade não mudou. A obtenção de alta conversão de óleo pesado vem se 

tornando um dos principais alvos das pesquisas e desenvolvimentos em matéria de processos de 

refino de frações pesadas de petróleo (Tovar et al., 2011; Martínez–Palou et al., 2011; de Lima e 

Schaeffer, 2011). 

Baseado no que foi citado, foi feito no LOPCA/LDPS o desenvolvimento de uma 

metodologia para a realização do upgrading do óleo cru e/ou fração pesada de petróleo a qual 

compreende o conceito de um processo híbrido e intensificado, nomeado como destilação 

molecular reativa, no qual acontece o acoplamento da destilação molecular (alto vácuo) e 



5 

conversão reativa simultaneamente ou, em outras palavras, o craqueamento dos compostos mais 

complexos (de maior massa molar) e a destilação dos compostos mais leves formados, 

permitindo, assim, a transformação do óleo cru e/ou fração pesada e/ou ultra–pesada em 

óleo/fração mais leve, garantindo um melhor escoamento e processamento deste. 

Desde o ponto de vista experimental uma das características mais importante deste 

avanço tecnológico em matéria de upgrading é a implementação de alto vácuo, permitindo 

submeter o material a temperaturas adequadas em um curto tempo operacional, e ter um contato 

muito intenso da amostra com a superfície catalítica sobre a superfície aquecida do evaporador. 

Assim, o potencial de aplicação desta nova técnica parece ser muito promissor, como já 

demonstrado por Winter (2011), cujos resultados evidenciaram um melhor aproveitamento das 

frações pesadas e ganhos na qualidade do produto final.  

No cenário atual da indústria e dos processos, há uma forte tendência para a implantação 

de processos computacionais baseados na modelagem e na simulação de um sistema com o 

propósito de que informações significativas possam ser retiradas sobre sua dinâmica e/ou seu 

desempenho. Na destilação molecular reativa, informações sobre o perfil de temperatura, a 

espessura do filme, a taxa de evaporação efetiva e o perfil de conversão são importantes porque 

permitem determinar o rendimento e a pureza dos produtos convertidos, assim como definir o 

projeto das próximas operações no destilador molecular reativo. Entretanto, a avaliação direta 

destas variáveis do processo não é viável, estando sujeita ao desenvolvimento de um modelo 

matemático adequado que possa descrever o processo em função das variáveis operacionais e, 

assim, ser útil para a análise do mesmo.  

Com esta finalidade e para abordar a modelagem do processo de destilação molecular 

reativa foram usadas neste trabalho de Tese equações de balanço (massa, energia e momento) que 

descrevem o comportamento do processo a partir das leis que regem seus fenômenos físicos e 

químicos. Também foram utilizadas equações algébrico–diferenciais gerando uma estrutura 

matemática (número e tipo de equações) chamada de modelo. Uma vez determinados os valores 

que as variáveis de saída tinham que adotar em diferentes condições de operação (variáveis de 

entrada), este procedimento foi chamado de simulação do processo; isto pode ser esquematizado 

na Figura 3.

Figura 3. Forma de abordar a modelagem e simulação do processo de destilação molecular reativa. 
 

Desta forma, a modelagem e a simulação formam uma ferramenta fundamental de 

auxílio na consolidação da tecnologia de destilação molecular reativa como processo híbrido e 

intensificado, no qual, através de simulações, considerando diferentes condições do processo foi 

possível obter informações rápidas e confiáveis sobre o desempenho do mesmo. Assim, o 

desenvolvimento desta ferramenta computacional permitiu entender como as variáveis 

operacionais características do processo (temperatura do evaporador, porcentagem de catalisador,  

pressão do sistema e vazão de alimentação), a composição da carga alimentada ao processo e as 

dimensões do evaporador (espaço entre a superfície do evaporador e a superfície do condensador 

e a distância radial da superfície do evaporador) influenciaram nas variáveis de saída: a espessura 

do filme, os perfis de temperatura e concentração no filme, a taxa de evaporação, a taxa de 

destilado produzido e a taxa de reação, parâmetros característicos dos processos de destilação 

molecular e destilação molecular reativa (tecnologia híbrida). 

Além disso, os resultados provenientes das análises teóricas (simulações), apresentadas 

neste trabalho de Tese, permitiram o estabelecimento de novas condições operacionais visando à 

obtenção de um alto desempenho operacional da unidade em relação ao melhor rendimento de 

separação e da taxa de reação. 

Finalmente, conseguiu–se dar um salto tecnológico, em matéria computacional e 

experimental, no processo de destilação molecular reativa, estabelecendo estratégias e condições 

operacionais que, concluíram em um efetivo aumento do desempenho técnico da unidade e

obtendo produtos com características favoráveis para exploração, escoamento, transferência, 

processamento primário e refino.

submetido ou a ser submetido em periódico internacional e/ou congresso) 

apresentando em língua inglesa, contendo um resumo, uma introdução do tópico 



11 

a desenvolver no artigo, a metodologia, os resultados e discussões, referências e 

nomenclatura. 

III. Por fim, apresentam–se as considerações e contribuições do capítulo. A síntese de 

todas as contribuições desta Tese de Doutorado é resumida no Capítulo 10.  

Capítulo 2: Apresenta–se uma revisão dos principais tópicos a serem tratados nesta 

Tese de Doutorado. Discutem–se os conceitos da caracterização de misturas complexas como é o 

petróleo e suas frações, processos atuais utilizados no processamento de resíduos de petróleo, 

conceitos e fundamentos referentes ao desenvolvimento do processo de destilação molecular e se 

estabelece o marco conceitual do processo da destilação molecular reativa como um processo 

híbrido e intensificado no qual acontece o acoplamento de destilação molecular e reação química 

simultaneamente, permitindo submeter o material a temperaturas adequadas, num curto tempo 

operacional, garantindo um contato muito intenso da amostra com a superfície catalítica 

proporcionando alta cinética de reação e alta taxa de evaporação permitindo altas taxas de 

processamento. 

Capítulo 3: Apresenta–se a metodologia de cálculo das propriedades físico–químicas, 

através de correlações empíricas reportadas na literatura, com sua comparação com as análises 

experimentais; visando seu acoplamento na modelagem matemática e na simulação do processo 

de destilação molecular centrífuga reativa. Foram utilizadas as abordagens de pseudo–

componentes e da termodinâmica contínua constituindo ferramentas (independente cada uma 

delas) para o cálculo das respectivas propriedades. As respostas das metodologias desenvolvidas 

forneceram valores das propriedades básicas (temperatura de ebulição normal e densidade), 

propriedades termodinâmicas (composição mássica e molar, temperatura crítica, pressão crítica e 

fator acêntrico); e propriedades termofísicas (viscosidade cinemática, condutividade térmica, 

calor especifico, entre outras).              

Capítulo 4: A descrição teórica do processo de destilação molecular é apresentada, 

sendo de grande potencial o contexto do desenvolvimento dos parâmetros teóricos (livre percurso 

médio, número de Knudsen e taxa de evaporação efetiva) envolvendo as condições operacionais 

da destilação molecular (temperatura do evaporador e pressão do sistema).        

Capítulo 5: Este capítulo contém o estudo fluidodinâmico do escoamento do filme 

líquido gerado na destilação molecular. A modelagem é fundamentada nas equações de balanços 



12 

de massa e momento no filme de líquido formado e escoando na superfície cônica do evaporador. 

Este trabalho tem como objetivo (i) investigar o efeito das diferentes condições de operação 

(vazão de alimentação e velocidade do rotor), com temperatura de evaporação constante (423,15 

K), no perfil de velocidade do filme fino de líquido de um resíduo atmosférico de petróleo na 

superfície do evaporador de um destilador molecular centrífugo, e (ii) estudar os componentes da 

velocidade nas direções –r, –? e –? (ou velocidade radial, angular e tangencial, respectivamente), 

considerando um estado bidimensional estacionário (no regime de fluxo laminar), onde o vetor 

velocidade perpendicular da superfície cônica (em direção –?) é ignorado, apenas vetores na 

direção radial (direção–r) e direção tangencial (direção –?) foram considerados.  

Capítulo 6: Neste capítulo se apresenta o desenvolvimento de uma ferramenta 

computacional para auxiliar na modelagem e a simulação do processo de destilação molecular 

centrifuga para estimar e avaliar os perfis característicos do processo através das variáveis de 

saída (o perfil de temperatura, o perfil de concentração do filme, o perfil da taxa efetiva de 

evaporação, o perfil da taxa de destilado e o perfil da espessura do filme) em função da análise 

das variáveis operacionais como temperatura da alimentação, a temperatura do evaporador, a 

pressão do sistema e os parâmetros geométricos do equipamento (distância entre o evaporador e o 

condensador, ângulo médio da superfície cônica e distância radial). 

Também é apresentada a metodologia computacional e experimental implementada para 

a separação das frações constitutivas dos cortes pesados de petróleo. Por outro lado, através de 

uma análise estatística é feito um estudo das principais variáveis que influenciam no rendimento 

das frações de petróleo obtidas, definindo as melhores condições operacionais para o 

processamento destas amostras. 

Capítulo 7: A análise termoanalítica – Calorimetria exploratória diferencial – do inglês 

DSC (Differential scaning calorimeter) foi usada com o objetivo de verificar as transições físico–

químicas ocorridas no processo de craqueamento das frações de petróleo (resíduos da destilação 

atmosférica de petróleo). Assim, este estudo objetivou estudar a cinética do processo de 

craqueamento de frações pesadas de petróleo, permitindo avaliar a influência da quantidade de 

catalisador (3, 5 e 10% m/m) durante a reação de craqueamento. 

Capítulo 8: Apresenta–se a modelagem e a simulação do processo de destilação 

molecular centrífugo reativo constituindo uma ferramenta fundamental no auxílio do 



13 

desenvolvimento experimental do processo, uma vez que informações sobre o perfil de 

temperatura, concentração, conversão de produtos, velocidade e taxa de destilado na superfície do 

filme permitem determinar o rendimento e eficiência do processo. 

Para a modelagem e a simulação do processo, foi considerado como caso de estudo o 

upgrading do resíduo atmosférico 673,15 K+ do petróleo “W” no destilador molecular centrífugo 

reativo. A modelagem desenvolvida baseada no modelo matemático do processo de destilação 

molecular centrífuga junto com as modificações introduzidas pelo termo cinético relativo à 

reação in–situ. Por fim, as equações de balanço de massa e de energia foram resolvidas 

numericamente através do método das linhas. 

Simultaneamente, neste capítulo, se descreve a metodologia experimental desenvolvida 

no estudo do processo de destilação molecular reativa, utilizando a unidade (de tipo centrífugo) 

construída pelos laboratórios de pesquisa LDPS/LOPCA/UNICAMP em parceria com os órgãos 

financiadores CENPES/PETROBRAS e FINEP.

Capítulo 2 

Perspectivas na aplicação, modelagem e 

simulação do processo de destilação 

molecular reativa: processo híbrido e 

intensificado 
 

2.1.     Introdução 

A intensificação de processos abrange novas e complexas tecnologias que substituem 

equipamentos grandes, caros e com grande consumo energético por plantas de menor custo, mais 

eficiente e de menor tamanho, contribuindo para um menor impacto ambiental (Keil, 2007). Na 

intensificação de processos podem ser utilizadas unidades de operação híbridas, as quais 

vinculam processos elementares tais como reação e separação, aumentando a produtividade e 

seletividade, além de facilitar a separação de subprodutos indesejáveis. A redução do número de 

etapas leva a um investimento reduzido e à redução significativa do gasto de energia. Além disso, 

a seletividade do produto conduz a uma diminuição do consumo de matéria–prima e 

consequentemente dos custos de operação (Keil, 2007).  

Hoje, na indústria do petróleo, grandes esforços estão sendo dedicados no 

desenvolvimento de alternativas direcionadas a aumentar o grau API e reduzir a viscosidade dos 

óleos pesados e extra–pesados, favorecendo as propriedades de escoamento e transporte. 

Portanto, surge o desafio para os grupos de pesquisa e desenvolvimento de projetar e aperfeiçoar 

tecnologias que permitam o upgrading destes óleos pesados e extra–pesados aumentando seu 

valor de comercialização e atingindo uma produção de derivados de maior valor agregado. 

Assim, os Laboratórios de Desenvolvimento de Processos de Separação (LDPS) e de Otimização, 

Projeto e Controle Avançado (LOPCA) da Faculdade de Engenharia Química da Unicamp, em 

parceria com o órgão Financiador de Estudos e Projetos do Ministério da Ciência e Tecnologia 

(FINEP) e o Centro de Pesquisa CENPES/PETROBRAS, têm desenvolvido estratégias 

tecnológicas para a caracterização e processamento destes materiais usando o processo de 

destilação molecular. Hoje a meta destas entidades é garantir a competitividade e estimular 



16 

economicamente a área de processamento dos óleos crus pesados e das frações pesadas obtidas 

da destilação atmosférica e da destilação a vácuo. Assim sendo, o aprimoramento da tecnologia 

nomeada “Destilação Molecular Reativa”, no qual acontece o acoplamento de destilação 

molecular (alto vácuo) e conversão reativa (craqueamento) simultaneamente, é caracterizada 

como um processo híbrido – intensificado. As características particulares do processo de 

destilação molecular reativa levam a: viabilizar a implementação de alto vácuo, permitindo 

submeter o material a temperaturas adequadas, ter um curto tempo de residência (operacional), e 

a ter um contato muito intenso da amostra com a superfície catalítica permitindo altas taxas de 

processamento. 

Portanto, este projeto propõe auxiliar a consolidação do sucesso tecnológico do processo 

de destilação molecular reativa, com o desenvolvimento de uma ferramenta computacional, sendo 

a modelagem e simulação um caminho disponibilizado pela área de pesquisa operacional 

estabelecendo cenários, a partir dos quais se pode: direcionar o processo de tomada de decisão, 

proceder a análises experimentais, avaliar o sistema como um conjunto de variáveis inter–

relacionadas e propor soluções para a melhoria da performance. No caso específico do processo 

de destilação molecular centrífuga reativa, os principais ganhos serão: (a) a previsão de 

resultados na execução de experimentos, (b) a determinação de condições operacionais, (c) a 

identificação de problemas antes mesmo de suas ocorrências, (d) a eliminação/decisões de 

procedimentos extras que possa desagregar/agregar valor ao processo, (e) a realização de análises 

de sensibilidade e (f) a redução de custos com o emprego de recursos (Silva, 2010). 

2.2.     Generalidade do petróleo 

O petróleo é uma mistura complexa de compostos formados em sua maioria por átomos 

de carbono e hidrogênio, chamados de hidrocarbonetos e outros átomos como oxigênio, enxofre, 

nitrogênio e metais (vanádio, níquel, ferro e cobre) (ASTM D 4175, 2009).  

O petróleo contém apreciável quantidade de constituintes que são classificados como 

não hidrocarbonetos. Estes constituintes, considerados como impurezas, possuem elementos 

como enxofre, nitrogênio, oxigênio e metais que podem aparecer em toda faixa de destilação do 

petróleo, mas tendem a se concentrar nas frações mais pesadas (Thomas, 2004).  



 

17 

De acordo com a sua estrutura, os hidrocarbonetos presentes no petróleo, são 

classificados em saturados, insaturados e aromáticos (Tabela 1). Os hidrocarbonetos saturados, 

também denominados de alcanos, são aqueles cujos átomos de carbono são unidos somente por 

ligações simples entre si às de átomos de hidrogênio, constituído de cadeias lineares (parafínicos 

normais), ramificadas (iso–parafínicos) ou cíclicas (naftênicos). Os hidrocarbonetos insaturados, 

também denominados de olefinas, apresentam pelo menos uma dupla ou tripla ligação carbono–

carbono, enquanto que os hidrocarbonetos aromáticos apresentam um anel de benzeno em sua 

estrutura (Thomas, 2004).  

 

 

Tabela 1. Classificação dos hidrocarbonetos presentes no petróleo segundo Bueno (2004). 

Constituintes Características 

Parafínicos • Teor de parafinas maior que 75% m/m. 
• São petróleos leves, fluidos ou de alto ponto de fluidez, com baixa densidade e baixo 

teor de resinas e asfaltenos. 

Naftênico–parafínico • Contêm 50–70% m/m de parafinas e mais que 20% m/m de naftênicos. 
• Apresentam teor de resinas e asfaltenos entre 5 e 15% m/m, baixo teor de enxofre 

(menos que 1%m/m) e teor de naftênicos entre 25 e 40% m/m.  

• A densidade e a viscosidade apresentam valores maiores que os parafínicos, mas ainda 
são moderados. 

Naftênicos • Teor de naftênicos maior que 70% m/m. 
• Apresentam baixo teor de enxofre e se originam de alteração bioquímica de óleos 

parafínicos e parafínicos–naftênicos. 

Aromáticos 

intermediários 
• Teor de aromáticos maior que 50% m/m. 
• São óleos pesados, contendo de 10 a 30% m/m de asfaltenos e resinas e teor de enxofre 

acima de 1% m/m. 

Aromático–naftênicos • São óleos que sofreram um processo inicial de biodegradação, através do qual as 
parafinas são removidas.  

• São derivados dos óleos parafínicos e parafínicos–naftênicos, podendo ter mais de 25% 
m/m de resinas e asfaltenos e teor de enxofre entre 0,4 e 1% m/m. 

Aromático–asfálticos • São pesados e viscosos, geralmente resultantes da alteração dos óleos aromáticos 
intermediários.  

• O teor de asfaltenos e resinas é elevado. 
 

2.3.     Caracterização físico–química das misturas  

Caracterizar físico–quimicamente substâncias significa definir seu comportamento 

físico–químico em processos, equipamentos industriais ou na aplicação de derivados como 

produtos sob diferentes condições operacionais, avaliando sua reatividade, incompatibilidade, 

estabilidade, solubilidade e facilidade para vaporizar, cristalizar e escoar. Tradicionalmente, a 

caracterização físico–química do petróleo é feita através de métodos convencionais que 

demandam tempo e conhecimento em diferentes técnicas analíticas, mas as metodologias 

analíticas já existentes sofrem adaptações ou novas precisam ser desenvolvidas para atender à 



18 

demanda de acompanhamento dos petróleos e/ou frações pesadas e ultra–pesadas. Assim, o 

conhecimento das principais propriedades destes materiais viabiliza a toma de decisão de forma 

rápida durante o processamento que visa o aumento da produção. 

Misturas de composição definida podem ser caracterizadas pela identificação de sua 

composição conjugado com o uso de regras de mistura, usadas para calcular as propriedades da 

mistura através da contribuição ponderada de cada componente da mistura. Misturas de 

composição não–definida, como o petróleo, são caracterizadas utilizando–se abordagens 

diferentes, entre as quais se listam: (i) Representar toda a mistura por um conjunto de 

propriedades, calculadas a partir de equações que utilizam propriedades básicas da mistura e que 

foram determinadas experimentalmente; e (ii) decomposição de toda a mistura em um conjunto 

de componentes individuais denominados pseudo–componentes, que não são definidos por uma 

fórmula química e sim por suas propriedades físicas e termodinâmicas (Coats, 1985; Daubert et 

al., 2000). Entre essas propriedades, listam–se a densidade, temperatura de ebulição, viscosidade, 

temperatura e pressão crítica, fator acêntrico e massa molar. 

2.3.1.     Metodologias para representar o petróleo e suas frações 

Os métodos de cálculos utilizados para a caracterização do petróleo e suas frações 

utilizam diferentes abordagens apresentadas a seguir: 

• Representar todo o petróleo ou fração seja por um único componente caracterizado por 

um conjunto de propriedades, calculadas por correlações a partir de pelo menos duas 

propriedades básicas (temperatura normal de ebulição, Tb e gravidade específica 

(densidade relativa), SG). Esta abordagem tem como maior vantagem sua simplicidade, 

no entanto apresenta imprecisões pelo fato de considerar uma mistura complexa 

multicomponente como um único componente. 

• Decompor o petróleo ou fração em um conjunto de número arbitrário pseudo–

componentes, representados por constituintes não–identificados. Cada pseudo–

componente é definido por suas propriedades termodinâmicas e físicas, tais como a 

densidade, temperatura de ebulição, viscosidade, temperatura e pressão críticas, fator 

acêntrico e massa molar, que devem estar disponíveis ou devem ser calculadas. De acordo 

com o método usado, pode ser necessário conhecer ainda a porcentagem dos tipos de 

hidrocarbonetos (Daubert et al., 2000). 



 

19 

A segunda abordagem, por pseudo–componente, pode estimar as propriedades 

termodinâmicas e físico–químicas por metodologias diferentes: 

• Contribuição de grupos necessita conhecer a composição química da fração, em termos de 

estruturas, por tipo de átomo de carbono.  

• Outra abordagem é através de modelos que utilizam componentes base (Hidrocarbonetos 

Parafínicos, Naftênicos e Aromáticos) (Quann e Jaffe, 1992; Hu e Zhu, 2001). Nesse 

caso, cada corte obtido através de uma destilação é representado por um conjunto de 

componentes fictícios (componentes base) de mesma massa molar (Riazi, 2004) ou 

mesmo número de átomos de carbono (Danesh, 1998). 

Na Tabela 2 se apresentam algumas contribuições referentes às abordagens para 

representar a mistura complexa do petróleo em termos da geração de pseudo–componentes. 

 

Tabela 2. Contribuição e desenvolvimento de metodologias para representar a mistura de componentes do petróleo. 

Referência Contribuição 

Riazi e Al–Sahhaf, 1996 Foi desenvolvida uma correlação generalizada para as propriedades de varias series homologas 

de hidrocarbonetos em termos da massa molar. Pode–se aplicar para hidrocarbonetos acima de 

C50. 

Quann e Jaffe, 1992 Apresentaram um método que representa moléculas de hidrocarbonetos como um vetor de 

incrementos de grupos estruturais. Uma mistura de hidrocarbonetos (tal como petróleo ou suas 

frações) é representada por um grupo desses vetores, cada um com um determinado peso 

percentual (que equivaleria à sua influência nas propriedades da mistura). Segundo Quann e 

Jaffe (1992), a representação de moléculas por vetores oferece uma estrutura adequada para a 

construção de redes de reação de tamanho e complexidade variados, para desenvolver 

correlações de propriedades baseadas em moléculas e para incorporar métodos de contribuição 

de grupos existentes para a estimativa de propriedades termodinâmicas. 

Miquel e Castells, 1993; 

1994 

Foi desenvolvido uma ferramenta computacional para caracterizar frações de petróleo em 

pseudo–componente. No trabalho um pseudo–componente é aquele que está definido por uma 

porção volumétrica da curva PEV, o qual está associado com uma temperatura normal de 

ebulição 

Hu e Zhu, 2001 Aplicaram um método de modelagem composicional para correlacionar propriedades de 

frações de petróleo, semelhante ao trabalho apresentado por Quann e Jaffe (1992). O 

método usado por Hu e Zhu (2001) faz uso de matrizes de séries homólogas de tipo 

molecular, onde as linhas da matriz representam o número de átomos de carbono e as 

colunas representam as séries homólogas (n–parafinas, isoparafinas, naftênicos, etc.); cada 

elemento da matriz representa a fração mássica ou molar de uma molécula ou lump (por 

exemplo, para uma série homóloga de um anel aromático e oito (08) átomos de carbono, 

há quatro (04) moléculas possíveis: etil–benzeno, orto–xileno, meta–xileno e para–xileno, 

cujas propriedades físicas são semelhantes por serem moléculas com mesmo número de 

átomos de carbono e pertencentes à mesma séria homóloga). 

Eckert e Van?k, 2005 Foi desenvolvida uma aproximação para a caracterização de misturas complexas baseada 

na representação da mistura original por um sistema de componentes. A nova mistura está 

completamente definida e caracterizada e as propriedades físicas podem ser obtidas de 

bases de dados. 



20 

2.3.1.1.  Conceito de mistura contínua para caracterização de frações de petróleo 

Um pouco mais complicado, mas com um tratamento das frações de petróleo mais 

preciso, é considerar esta mistura complexa de hidrocarbonetos como uma mistura contínua. 

Nesta aproximação, a mistura não é expressa em termos de um número finito de pseudo–

componentes e suas propriedades estão dadas por uma função de distribuição continua. Este 

método é equivalente à aproximação por pseudo–componentes, mas com um número infinito de 

componentes (Rätzsch e Kehlen, 1983). Nesta aproximação no lugar de especificar um 

componente i, este é expresso por um de seus parâmetros característicos (temperatura normal de 

ebulição, Tb ou massa molar, M). 

A representação da composição química da mistura complexa, dada por uma série de 

valores discretos de concentrações dos componentes, pode ser substituída por uma função de 

distribuição continua (FDC) F(I), onde o índice contínuo (I) está definido em termos de uma ou 

mais propriedades macroscópicas de caracterização, tais como ponto de ebulição (Tb), massa 

específica (?) ou massa molar (M).  

Uma mistura na qual as concentrações de alguns dos componentes são dadas por valores 

discretos e outros são descritos por FDCs é chamada de mistura semi–contínua. No caso do 

petróleo, a mistura complexa de componentes, é uma mistura semi–contínua, formada por 

componentes discretos (hidrocarbonetos leves e gases inorgânicos como CO2, N2, H2, etc.) e uma 

distribuição contínua, representando todos os demais componentes (componentes não 

identificados como hidrocarbonetos pesados e componentes identificados) (Cotterman e 

Prausnitz, 1985).  

Os primeiros trabalhos em termodinâmica semi–contínua foram realizados por  

Cotterman et al. (1985) em sistemas com polímeros e petróleo, onde se compararam os resultados 

das distribuições contínuas com aqueles dos componentes discretos.  Kehlen et al. (1985) 

analisaram matematicamente a termodinâmica contínua, enfatizando as facilidades da abordagem 

no tratamento de misturas contendo muitos componentes, pois são melhores descritas por funções 

de distribuição, do que através de frações molares para componentes discretos.  

2.3.1.2.  Funções de distribuição utilizadas na termodinâmica contínua 

Existem diversas funções matemáticas que podem ser usadas na representação da 

distribuição de propriedades termodinâmicas de misturas complexas (Tabela 3). Podem–se citar 



 

21 

entre outras, as funções normais ou gaussianas, exponenciais e log–normal. No entanto, Riazi 

(1989) apresenta a função Gamma, obtendo bastante sucesso quando é aplicada na representação 

de misturas complexas de hidrocarbonetos derivados do petróleo. Um ponto crucial para o 

sucesso da uma modelagem termodinâmica, sob a hipótese de continuidade da mistura, é a 

escolha do índice contínuo (I). Alguns autores escolhem um índice mais usual, como a massa 

molar ou ponto de ebulição (Du e Mansoori, 1986). Outra tendência mais recente desenvolvida 

por Peixoto et al. (2000) é de escolher como índice continuamente distribuído, o número de 

grupos funcionais presentes na molécula.

Para este trabalho, a composição química da mistura é melhor representada, 

naturalmente, pela distribuição de uma propriedade termodinâmica que esteja diretamente 

relacionada com a volatilidade dos componentes. Sendo assim, a temperatura de ebulição é usada 

como propriedade de caracterização da mistura. De acordo com Vakili–Nezhaad et al. (2001), 

essa consideração simplifica significativamente a modelagem de caracterização de misturas 

complexas de hidrocarbonetos. 

2.4.     Avanços nas tecnologias dos processos para o upgrading de 

óleos pesados e fundos 

Nas unidades de destilação atmosférica e de vácuo são geradas basicamente duas 

correntes de fundo: resíduo atmosférico como aquele material de fundo da coluna de destilação 



22 

atmosférica, o qual apresenta uma temperatura atmosférica equivalente (TAE) de 616,15 K
+
. Este 

resíduo constitui a carga da coluna de vácuo. O resíduo de vácuo constitui o produto de fundo da 

destilação a vácuo (3,33–13,33 kPa), obtido a uma temperatura TAE de 838,15 K
+
 (Rana et al., 

2007; Maciel–Filho et al., 2006).  

Um resíduo atmosférico possui componentes com número de carbonos superiores a 25 

(C25) e densidade API menor do que 20, enquanto, o resíduo de vácuo apresenta componentes 

com número de carbonos maiores de 50 e massa molar superior a 800 kg·kmol
-1

. Os resíduos de 

petróleo (ou produtos de fundo das destilações atmosféricas e a vácuo) apresentam uma estrutura 

complexa e esta complexidade é incrementada na medida em que aumenta sua temperatura de 

ebulição, a massa molar, a densidade, a viscosidade, o índice de refração (aromaticidade) e a 

polaridade (conteúdo de heteroátomos e metais). Estes produtos são ricos em componentes 

polares como resinas e asfaltenos, possuem também espécies químicas de diferente 

aromaticidade, heteroátomos funcionais e alto conteúdo de metais, quando comparados com o 

óleo cru, ou frações leves. As alternativas para processamento de resíduos são divididas em duas 

rotas principalmente como se apresenta na Tabela 4 e descritas na continuação.

Estes processos são caracterizados pelo baixo investimento e custos operacionais de 

hidroprocessamento, mas o rendimento de produtos leves tende a ser menor e o valor agregado de 

seus produtos, portanto, é menor. Além disso, os produtos líquidos obtidos a partir de processos 

térmicos contêm S, N e metais (V, Ni, etc) que realmente precisam de purificação através de 

hidrotratamento como HDS (hydrodesulfurization), HDN (hydrodenitrogenation) e HDM 

(hydrodemetallization), respectivamente (Rana et al., 2007). 

2.4.2.     Processos catalíticos para o processamento de resíduos de petróleo 

O craqueamento catalítico consiste nas reações de quebra catalítica de moléculas de 

cadeias carbônicas de compostos pesados, tais como, gasóleo e resíduos de outros processos do 

refino do petróleo (resíduos de fundo da destilação atmosférica e a vácuo). A presença de 

catalisador sólido particulado a alta temperatura acelera a quebra das cadeias, produzindo 

hidrocarbonetos mais leves e de maior valor comercial. 

A seguir, se apresenta uma breve descrição dos processos catalíticos: craqueamento 

catalítico fluidizado e hidrocraqueamento.

Craqueamento catalítico fluidizado (FCC) 

Este processo é utilizado nas refinarias para a conversão de produtos pesados em produtos mais leves, 

de maior valor agregado. Por exemplo, a produção de gasolina (iso–octano) e gás de cozinha (propano 

+ butano) a partir do craqueamento catalítico dos gasóleos, e hoje, diesel (Pagani, 2009). 

Características e vantagens                 Fonte: Ribeiro, 2007; Vieira, 2002  

• Ocorre em equipamentos chamados de conversores que são compostos basicamente de um tubo 

vertical (riser), um vaso separador/stripper e um regenerador. 

• O FCC (Figura 1) é um processo utilizado para a conversão de hidrocarbonetos com massa molar 

mais elevada, tais como gasóleo (proveniente da unidade de destilação a vácuo) e resíduos do 

processo de refino do petróleo, em produtos mais leves e de maior valor comercial, através do contato 

com um catalisador pulverizado em condições apropriadas de processo. 

• Grande flexibilidade, no sentido de ajustar sua produção às reais necessidades do mercado 

consumidor. 

• Está ligado ao aspecto econômico das frações residuais, onde frações de baixo valor comercial são 

convertidas em derivados nobres de alto valor, tais como a gasolina e o GLP. 

Figura 1. Processo de craqueamento catalítico fluidizado. Fonte: (Erthal, 2003)  

Descrição do processo 

A carga de alimentação (gasóleo e resíduos), que é previamente 

aquecida, entra em contato com o catalisador (material sólido à 

base de sílica e alumina) a alta temperatura, provocando sua 

vaporização quase que instantânea.  

Devido à ação da temperatura e das propriedades catalíticas do 

meio, as moléculas da carga são quebradas principalmente em 

compostos separados por três frações distintas: gás combustível, 

moléculas contendo 1 a 2 átomos de carbono, C1 e C2, de 3 a 12 

átomos de carbono GLP (gás liquefeito de petróleo) e nafta de 

craqueamento (gasolina automotiva) de 5 a 12 átomos de carbono, 

C5 a C12 (LCO e óleo decantado).  

Algumas destas correntes podem passar por processos de 

tratamento químico onde são reduzidos os teores de enxofre. No 

craqueamento também é formando o coque que consiste 

primordialmente de cadeias carbônicas não craqueadas, metais 

pesados e compostos aromáticos com características próximas a 

do grafite, que é o responsável tanto geração de energia quanto  

pela desativação do catalisador.

Hidrocraqueamento 

O hidrocraqueamento (Figura 2) é um processo em 2 estágios, combinando o craqueamento catalítico e a 

hidrogenação.  

Características e vantagens                    Fonte: Equipe Petrobras, 2002 

• Os produtos deste processo são hidrocarbonetos saturados; dependendo das condições de reação (temperatura, 

pressão, atividade catalítica), estes produtos variam de etano e GLP aos hidrocarbonetos pesados compostos 

principalmente de isoparafinas. Hidrocraqueamento normalmente é facilitado por um catalisador bifuncional 

que é capaz de reorganizar e quebrar cadeias de hidrocarbonetos assim como a adição de hidrogênio a 

aromáticos e olefinas para produzir naftenos e alcanos.  

• Este processo emprega altas pressões, altas temperaturas, um catalisador e hidrogênio. 

• A grande vantagem do hidrocraqueamento é sua extrema versatilidade. Pode operar com cargas que variam, 

desde nafta, até gasóleos pesados ou resíduos leves, maximizando a fração que desejar o refinador. 

• Outra grande vantagem constatada é a qualidade das frações no que diz respeito a contaminantes. 

• Diante das severíssimas condições em que ocorrem as reações, praticamente todas as impurezas, como 

compostos de enxofre, nitrogênio, oxigênio e metais, são radicalmente reduzidas ou eliminadas dos produtos. 

• A desvantagem do processo consiste nas drásticas condições operacionais. Elevadas pressões e temperaturas 

são usadas, o que obriga a utilização de equipamentos caros e de grande porte, com elevado investimento. 

Figura 2. Processo de hidrocraqueamento.  

Fonte: Equipe Petrobras, 2002 

Descrição do processo • No primeiro estágio, a carga pré–
aquecida é misturada com um 

reciclo de hidrogênio e enviada 

para o primeiro estágio do reator, 

onde o catalisador converte os 

compostos de enxofre e nitrogênio 

em sulfeto de hidrogênio e amônia. 

• Após os hidrocarbonetos deixarem 

o primeiro estágio, estes são 

resfriados e liquefeitos e em 

seguida passam por um separador. 

O hidrogênio é reciclado para 

voltar a misturar com a carga 

fresca. Dependendo dos produtos 

desejados (gasolina, combustível 

de aeronaves e gasóleo), o 

fracionador é ajustado para separar 

os produtos em uma determinada 

faixa. 

• Os resíduos de fundo do 

fracionador são misturados com 

hidrogênio e enviados ao segundo 

estágio desde que esta material 

também esteja sujeito a 

hidrogenação e reforma. As 

operações do segundo estágio são 

mais severas (altas temperaturas e 

pressões) já que vai craquear 

resíduos mais pesados. Os produtos 

oriundos do segundo estágio são 

então enviados a coluna 

fracionadora.

2.5.     Opções tecnológicas não–convencionais 

2.5.1.     O processo de destilação molecular 

O processo de destilação molecular teve seu desenvolvimento, inicialmente, nos Estados 

Unidos e Europa na década de 30 para permitir a purificação de produtos termicamente sensíveis. 

Na América Latina, os trabalhos de Destilação Molecular foram iniciados no Brasil com os 

trabalhos realizados no LDPS/LOPCA/UNICAMP com o trabalho de Batistella (1996) na área de 

química fina e com posteriores trabalhos na área de óleos lubrificantes e frações de petróleo 

(Tovar et al., 2011; Zuñiga–Liñan et al., 2011; Tovar et al., 2010; Medina et al., 2010; Zuñiga, 

2009; Zuñiga et al., 2009; Zuñiga et al., 2009; Hernández, 2009; ; Winter et al., 2009; Rocha, 

2009; Hernández et al., 2008; Lopes, 2008; Rocha, 2008; Rocha et al., 2008; Fregolente et al., 

2007; Liñan et al., 2007; Lopes et al., 2007; Rocha et al., 2007; Winter, 2007; Winter et al., 2007; 

Martins et al., 2006; Martins et al., 2006; Sbaite et al., 2006; Maciel–Filho et al., 2006;  Moraes 

et al., 2006; Winter et al., 2006; Fregolente et al., 2005; Sbaite, 2005; Winter et al., 2004; Sbaite 

et al., 2003; Batistella et al., 2002; Batistella et al., 2000; Batistella e Wolf–Maciel, 1998, 1996). 

A destilação molecular constitui um tipo de processo de vaporização a baixas pressões e, 

portanto, baixas temperaturas, que apresenta utilidade na separação e purificação de materiais 

com baixa volatilidade, bem como para aqueles que apresentam sensibilidade térmica (Tovar et 

al., 2011; Zuñiga–Liñan et al., 2011; Tovar et al., 2010; Zuñiga et al., 2009).  

O interesse atual sobre o processo de destilação molecular é crescente devido às suas 

vantagens industriais e sua aplicabilidade nas indústrias de cosméticos, alimentos, farmacêutica, 

química, petroquímica, plásticos entre outras, para a recuperação, purificação e concentração de 

substâncias (Catálogo UIC GmbH, 2010). 

2.5.1.1.  Características operacionais de destilação molecular 

A destilação molecular se caracteriza por tempos de residência curtos, cujos valores 

variam entre 1 e 10 s (Lutišan e Cvengroš, 1995) e, em alguns casos, pode chegar até a 0,2 s 

(Holló et al., 1971), apresentar alta taxa de evaporação (20–40 g·m
-2

·s
-1

) (Cvengroš et al., 2000) e 

empregar baixa pressão (0,13 Pa – 0,0133 Pa) (Batistella, 1996). O uso de baixa pressão, além de 

eliminar a oxidação que pode acontecer na presença de ar (Burrows, 1973), permite a utilização 

de temperaturas mais brandas na separação quando comparado aos processos convencionais de 



 

27 

destilação e evaporação, fato que, juntamente com o pequeno tempo de residência, minimiza as 

perdas por decomposição térmica.  

2.5.1.2.  O comportamento da fase vapor 

Lutišan e Cvengroš (1995) descreveram a fase vapor a partir das variáveis 

macroscópicas do processo de destilação molecular apresentadas na Tabela 6.

2.5.2.     O processo de destilação molecular reativa: processo híbrido e 

intensificado 

A intensificação de processos é uma abordagem revolucionária para processar, 

implementar e desenvolver processos, proporcionando desafios e oportunidades inovadoras para 

as indústrias, a fim de aumentar a produtividade, flexibilidade, segurança e, diminuir o consumo 

de energia, geração de resíduos e custo operacional sem prejudicar a qualidade do produto, 

seguindo uma das rotas descritas por Keil (2007) na Figura 3.  

Outras definições apresentadas no livro autorado por Keil (2007) são: 

Cross e Ramshaw (1986) definem a intensificação de processos como: “Um termo usado para 

descrever a estratégia de redução de tamanho da planta de produtos químicos necessários para 

atingir um objetivo de produção determinado”. 



28 

Stankiewicz e Moulijn (2002) definiram a intensificação de processos como: “Qualquer 

desenvolvimento na engenharia química que permita uma tecnologia limpa e energeticamente 

mais eficiente”.

Em resumo, a intensificação do processo consiste no desenvolvimento de novos 

equipamentos, métodos, processos e técnicas na área de engenharia química, que quando 

comparado com a atual, traz melhoras na produção, diminuindo substancialmente o tamanho do 

equipamento sem perjudicar a capacidade de produção (redução dos investimentos e dos custos 

das matérias–primas), com a diminuição do consumo de energia (redução dos custos), e/ou 

diminuição da produção de resíduos. Por conseguinte, as vantagens que oferece a intensificação 



 

29 

de processos na engenharia química e na engenharia de processo chegam a ser resumidas em seis 

elementos principais: custos, segurança, compactação, condições controladas, eficiência e tempo 

(Stankiewicz e Moulijn, 2002).  

Portanto, a Tese de Doutorado abrange o desenvolvimento em nível computacional 

(modelagem e simulação) e experimental do processo de destilação molecular reativa, no qual 

acontece o acoplamento de destilação molecular e conversão (reação química) simultaneamente, 

podendo ser qualificado como um processo híbrido e também como um processo intensificado, 

dado a configuração do equipamento e as condições operacionais, que viabilizam a 

implementação de alto vácuo, permitindo submeter o material a temperaturas adequadas, num 

curto tempo operacional, garantindo um contato muito intenso da amostra com a superfície 

catalítica. Estes fatores devem proporcionar alta cinética de reação e alta taxa de evaporação 

permitindo altas taxas de processamento.  

Assim sendo, com o desenvolvimento do processo de destilação molecular reativa 

obtêm–se ganhos em termos de conversões e separação de produtos, apresentando por sua vez 

características vantajosas e favoráveis à intensificação de processos, seguindo a classificação de 

Keil (2007) tais como: 

• Condições experimentais de temperatura e pressão mais afáveis com o processamento da 

carga favorecendo a reação de craqueamento, que levam a um melhor controle dos 

produtos convertidos numa única etapa de processo. 

• Maior contato dos reagentes (alimentação) com a superfície do catalisador o que permite 

um incremento na taxa de transferência de massa dadas as condições de processo. 

• Abordagem multidisciplinar, que considera as oportunidades para melhorar a tecnologia 

de processo de forma simultânea com o acoplamento de dois processos 

separação/craqueamento. 

Com respeito à modelagem do destilador molecular reativo, esta está baseada na 

modelagem desenvolvida para o processo de destilação molecular. Ela foi devidamente adaptada, 

com objetivo de fazer estudos de predição e também de avaliação do processo, levando à 

condução de trabalhos experimentais em condições já otimizadas e mesmo possibilitando, a 

priori, a verificação dos resultados que seriam conseguidos com uma aplicação experimental. 



30 

Equações de balanço de massa, de energia e momento, foram consideradas nesta 

modelagem.  A taxa de evaporação considerada foi a de evaporação efetiva de Langmuir, levando 

em consideração os efeitos da fase vapor e o grau de anisotropia do sistema.  

O termo cinético reativo foi incorporado ao modelo. A equação da cinética de reação foi 

aplicada para determinar a conversão química através das concentrações de cada componente na 

superfície do evaporador. 

2.5.2.1. Considerações teóricas sobre a destilação molecular centrífuga reativa 

Durante a destilação molecular centrífuga reativa (Figura 4), o líquido a ser processado 

flui ao longo da superfície cônica do evaporador devido à forca centrífuga e gravitacional e é 

distribuído homogeneamente na superfície do evaporador na forma de um filme muito fino com 

uma espessura que depende da viscosidade da mistura e das condições operacionais de vazão de 

alimentação e velocidade do rotor.

de destilação molecular centrífuga reativa. 1.

Resistência elétrica, 4. Suporte da resistência; 5.

condensador; 8. Serpentinas de arrefecimento. 



 

31 

A reação de craqueamento e a separação dos componentes da mistura no destilador 

molecular centrífugo reativo ocorrem basicamente em cinco (05) etapas: 

• Etapa 1: Reação catalítica nas camadas internas do filme que escoa sobre a superfície do 

evaporador (Figura 5a). 

• Etapa 2: Transporte das moléculas craqueadas nas camadas internas do filme e 

evaporadas desde a mistura líquida até a superfície livre do filme. 

• Etapa 3: Destilação da mistura (componentes de alta massa molar e componentes de 

menor massa molar quando comparado com a alimentação) desde a superfície livre do 

filme. 

• Etapa 4: Transporte das moléculas evaporadas na superfície livre do filme através do 

espaço da destilação (distância entre a superfície de evaporação e a superfície de 

condensação). 

• Etapa 5: condensação da(s) molécula(s) evaporada(s) mais volátil(eis). 

 

Assim, para a simulação, foi considerado como caso de estudo o processamento de um 

resíduo atmosférico do petróleo “W” (ATR–W) 673,15 K
+
, em um destilador molecular 

centrífugo reativo aquecido, onde a superfície do evaporador constitui uma superfície cônica. O 

resíduo atmosférico total foi dividido em 02 pseudo–componentes, os quais foram caracterizados 

utilizando dados de propriedades físico–químicas geradas pelo simulador desenvolvido por Tovar 

et al. (2011). 

Em relação ao desenvolvimento experimental, ensaios foram desenvolvidos entre 473.15 

e 523.15 K considerando na carga do processo 1, 3 e 5% m/m de catalisador, constituindo um 

processo em catálise heterogênea (termo que descreve a catálise quando o catalisador está em 

uma fase diferente (ou seja sólido) aos reactantes). Como resultados foram obtidos quinze cortes 

de destilados e quinze de resíduos do processo de destilação molecular centrífuga reativa, cujas 

propriedades de massa molar, viscosidade, massa específica e °API foram avaliadas utilizando 

técnicas cromatográficas (SEC do inglês size–exclusion chromatography), análises reológicas e 

métodos padronizados (ASTM D 4052, ASTM D 5002 e ASTM D 70).    



32 

2.6.     Considerações finais  

Neste capítulo foi apresentada uma breve revisão dos principais conceitos envolvidos no 

petróleo, sua composição, tecnologias catalíticas e não–catalíticas para o processamento de 

resíduos pesados, assim como opções tecnológicas para o processamento destas matérias–primas. 

Também foi apresentado o processo de destilação molecular reativa, objeto de estudo nesta Tese 

de Doutorado, como um processo híbrido e intensificado.  

De acordo com os objetivos e delineamentos do processo de destilação molecular 

reativa, o óleo cru pesado e as frações pesadas de petróleo constituíram a matéria–prima para o 

sistema de separação – reacional não–convencional, representando um considerável avanço no 

sistema de análise desses materiais e proporcionando um melhor aproveitamento destes materiais, 

além de ganhos na qualidade e rendimento dos produtos finais. 

A modelagem e a simulação da destilação molecular reativa constituem uma ferramenta 

fundamental de auxílio na consolidação da tecnologia de destilação molecular reativa como 

processo híbrido e intensificado, no qual, através de simulações, considerando diferentes 

condições do processo, será possível obter informações rápidas e confiáveis sobre o desempenho 

do mesmo. 

Além disso, os resultados provenientes do desenvolvimento computacional (modelagem 

e simulação) do processo de destilação molecular centrífuga reativa de óleo cru pesado e frações 

pesadas permitirão o estabelecimento de novas condições operacionais à escala piloto, visando à 

obtenção de um alto desempenho operacional da unidade, como: a redução do consumo de 

energia e utilidades, a minimização da quantidade de resíduos e o melhor rendimento de 

separação, características de um processo intensificado. 

Finalmente, um salto tecnológico está sendo dado, em matéria de modelagem, simulação 

e experimentação, nos processo de fracionamento, separação e conversão do petróleo e suas 

frações pesadas obtidos das destilações atmosféricas e de vácuo, pois com uma melhor conversão 

do petróleo através da proposta tecnológica, poderão ser estabelecidas estratégias e condições 

operacionais que, seguramente, favorecerá a cadeia produtiva do petróleo.

Capítulo 3 

Enfoque computacional para a 

caracterização físico–química de frações de 

petróleo visando à modelagem do processo 

de destilação molecular reativa 
 

3.1.     Introdução 

O petróleo constitui uma mistura complexa de hidrocarbonetos formados na rocha 

sedimentar como consequência da conversão de componentes orgânicos em hidrocarbonetos 

(parafinas, oleofinas, naftênos e aromáticos), os quais são encontrados como gases (gás natural), 

líquidos (óleo cru), semi–sólidos (betumem), ou sólidos (asfalto) (Riazi, 2004).  

Atualmente, os investimentos em tecnologia na área de petróleo estão em ascensão, 

sendo esses imprescindíveis, tanto para viabilizar a sua produção, disponível nas reservas 

brasileiras como, também, para o refino desse,  que possui características físico–químicas 

diferentes dos petróleos encontrados em outras regiões. Esse crescimento levou à implantação de 

inúmeras empresas nesse setor e o desenvolvimento de projetos de pesquisa e engenharia, que 

apresentam um viés tecnológico, a fim de garantirem uma melhora no rendimento e qualidade do 

óleo, aumentando, com isso, a competitividade na área do petróleo no Brasil. 

Em se tratando de misturas indefinidas, métodos particulares para sua caracterização são 

necessários. Essa caracterização, experimentalmente, é obtida através das normas ASTM e curvas 

de destilação, que visa modelar o comportamento do petróleo, das correntes das frações pesadas e 

ultra–pesadas. Um artifício usado é a caracterização das frações como um conjunto de pseudo–

componentes, em número suficiente para descrever as propriedades físico–químicas de interesse.   

A proposta deste capítulo compreende o desenvolvimento de uma metodologia teórica 

baseada em abordagens de pseudo–componentes discretos e contínuos. Este procedimento 

constitui uma tentativa para predizer o comportamento de tais misturas com a menor quantidade 

de dados de entrada necessários. 



34 

Na literatura existem aproximações que representam as propriedades dos petróleos em 

estudo. Uma delas é a aproximação por contribuição de grupos. Essa metodologia necessita 

conhecer a composição química, em termos de estruturas, por tipo de átomo de carbono. Uma das 

suas desvantagens é a de apresentar desvios acentuados, especialmente para frações pesadas, e 

por essa razão, não tem sido utilizada com frequência. 

Outra abordagem são os modelos que utilizam como componentes bases 

(hidrocarbonetos Parafínicos, Naftênicos e Aromáticos) (Quann e Jaffe, 1992 e Hu e Zhu, 2001). 

Nesse caso, o óleo cru, fração ou corte obtido através de uma destilação é representado por um 

conjunto de componentes fictícios (componentes base) de mesma massa molar (Riazi, 2004) ou 

mesmo número de átomos de carbono (Danesh, 1998). 

Indistintamente, Coats (1985) fez uma contribuição importante ligada à simulação 

computacional, criando um agrupamento de componentes, que ficou conhecida como 

“pseudoização”. Essa contribuição teve como objetivo reduzir o número de elementos 

necessários para a representação de um fluido, com consequente redução do processamento 

computacional.  

Um pseudo–componente está primeiramente definido por sua (pseudo) temperatura de 

ebulição e por alguns parâmetros, principalmente, gravidade específica, massa molar ou 

viscosidade. As propriedades físicas restantes (sendo elas as propriedades termodinâmicas e 

termofísicas) precisam ser estimadas. Em Miquel e Castells (1993 e 1994) é apresentada uma 

metodologia computacional para a previsão das propriedades onde se caracterizaram e se 

agruparam os compostos da mistura, formando uma série de pseudo–componentes baseada na 

premissa de um fator de caracterização (Kw) constante.  

Dessa forma, a metodologia descrita por Miquel e Castells (1993 e 1994) foi adotada no 

trabalho com modificações nas sub–rotinas de cálculo e nas correlações das estimativas das 

propriedades básicas e termodinâmicas.  

Mais uma abordagem analisada no trabalho utiliza o conceito da termodinâmica de 

misturas contínuas ou semi–contínuas, a qual é chamada por muitos autores de termodinâmica 

contínua (Cotterman e Prausnitz, 1985; Cotterman et al., 1985; Rätzsch e Kehlen, 1983; Shibata 

et al., 1987). A distribuição contínua ou termodinâmica contínua é usada para descrever uma 

mistura complexa de componentes (não identificados, como hidrocarbonetos pesados, e 



 

35 

componentes identificados), através de uma função de distribuição, seja analítica ou numérica. 

Esse método relaciona uma ou mais variáveis mensuráveis, tais como, a massa molar ou a 

temperatura de ebulição com a composição da mistura. 

A resposta das metodologias desenvolvidas fornecerá valores das propriedades básicas 

(temperatura de ebulição normal e densidade), e das propriedades termodinâmicas (composição 

mássica e molar, temperatura crítica, pressão crítica e fator acêntrico) para cada pseudo–

componente. Todas essas informações são obtidas a partir da entrada de dados experimentais das 

propriedades (curva de destilação PEV e densidade da fração completa), que tradicionalmente são 

medidas em laboratórios. 

Frente ao exposto, torna–se claro o destaque que os temas relacionados à caracterização 

e a determinação das propriedades físico–químicas das frações do petróleo têm no 

desenvolvimento de estudos teóricos e experimentais de técnicas de processamento dessas 

amostras. Dessa forma, os resultados provenientes desta primeira fase permitirão a obtenção das 

propriedades físico–químicas, através das correlações empíricas reportadas na literatura, através 

da sua comparação com as análises experimentais; Visa–se, assim, a sua inserção na modelagem 

matemática e na simulação do processo da destilação molecular reativa.

Overview and computational approach for studying the physicochemical 

characterization of high–boiling–point petroleum fractions (350 °C
+
) 

Abstract  

The processing and upgrading of high–boiling–point petroleum fractions (350 °C
+
), 

containing a large number of components from different groups (paraffins, olefins, naphthenes, 

aromatics) require an in–depth evaluation.  In order to characterize them, their thermodynamic 

and thermophysical properties must be determined. This work presents a computational approach 

based on the breakdown of the petroleum fraction into pseudocomponents defined by a trial–and–

error exercise in which the mass– and molar– balance errors were minimized. Cases studies are 

illustrated to three heavy residues 400°C
+
 of “W, Y and Z” crude oil. This procedure requires the 

boiling point distillation curve and the density of the whole fraction as the input bulk properties. 

The methods proposed according to available correlations in the literature and standard industrial 

methods were mainly used to estimate properties that include the basic properties (normal boiling 

point, density and Watson factor characterization), the thermodynamic properties (molar mass 

and critical properties) and the thermophysical and transport properties (kinematic viscosity, 

thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity and vapor pressure). The methodology developed has 

shown to be a useful tool for calculating a remarkably broad range of physicochemical properties 

of high–boiling–point petroleum fractions with good accuracy when the bulk properties are 

available, since computational approach gave an overall absolute deviation lower than 10% when 

compared with the experimental results obtained in the research laboratories LDPS /LOPCA / 

UNICAMP.

1.        Introduction 

Investment in technology in the petroleum industry is increasing and this is essential 

both to enable the use of available oil reserves worldwide, and to refine petroleum with different 



38 

physical and chemical characteristics. This growth has led to the establishment of numerous 

companies in this sector and the development of research and engineering projects with 

technological bias, in order to ensure improvement in petroleum yield and quality, increasing 

competitiveness in this sector. 

Petroleum fractions are undefined mixtures of hydrocarbon compounds with a limited 

boiling point range, and their properties depend on their compositions and types of hydrocarbon 

present in the mixture (aromatics, paraffins, olefins, and naphthenes). Subsequently, in the field 

of production, refining, processing and upgrading technologies for petroleum fractions, the values 

of the basic, thermodynamic and thermophysical properties must be available (Merdrignac and 

Espinat, 2007). 

In general, three classes of predictive correlations are published in the open literature: (i) 

One class contains the group contribution method, but it can not be used for mixtures of unknown 

structure and composition (e.g. high–boiling–point petroleum fractions); (ii) another approach is 

via models using basic components (paraffinic hydrocarbons and naphthenic compounds) (Hu 

and Zhu, 2001; Quann and Jaffe, 1992). In this case, the crude oil, fraction or cut obtained by 

distillation, is represented by a set of hypothetical components (basic components) of the same 

molar mass (Riazi, 2004) or even with the same number of carbon atoms (Danesh, 1998). (iii) 

The last class comprises a pseudoization approach, where the properties are estimated from their 

basic properties, such as the boiling point (Tb), specific gravity (SG) and Watson factor 

characterization (Kw) (Daubert and Danner, 1997). 

Hence, this work presents an accurate computational approach used for evaluating and 

estimating the physicochemical properties of three (03) petroleum fractions (high–boiling–point 

petroleum fractions). The petroleum fraction was broken down into pseudocomponents based on 

the knowledge of their global properties such as the boiling point distillation data (BP) of the 

whole fraction and the specific gravity (SG). The methodology adopted in this work was based on 

the procedure presented by Miquel and Castells (1993, 1994). The aim of the work consisted of 

two parts. (i) The first part consisted of the estimation of the basic properties and the 

thermodynamic properties (such as molar mass (M), density (?) and critical properties (critical 

temperature (Tc), critical pressure (Pc), critical volume (Vc) and acentric factor (?ac)) based on a 

route for the minimization of the error, depending on the type of correlation set used; and (ii) the 



 

39 

second part consisted of the estimation of the thermophysical properties (kinematic viscosity (?), 

thermal conductivity (?), specific heat capacity (Cp) and vapor pressure (Pvap)). The 

characterization procedure was carried out for each whole fraction and for the set of 

pseudocomponents (NPSE), identifying each physicochemical property with a subscript NPSE. 

The choice of correlation depends on: (a) the use of the specific property or the input data to 

predict another property; and (b) the accuracy and range of applicability of the property. The 

reliability of the data estimated by the computational approach (pseudoization method) was 

determined by comparison with the experimental information. Taking into account that the 

modeling approach is not exact, but approximate, its inaccuracy was evaluated by approximation 

regarding to experimental data. Results estimated in order to retry the basic properties of the 

entire fractions were evaluated in terms of the minimization of mass– and molar– balance error. 

On the other hand, thermophysical and transport properties, in the temperature range between 350 

K and 600 K, were evaluated in terms of average absolute deviation (AAD%) which is define as a 

relation among the absolute deviation of estimating a quantity divided by its experimental value 

(yi,ref).The absolute deviation is defined as the difference between the observed value (yi,ref) and 

the response predicted by the modeling approach at each operating condition (yi,cal) as follows:

1.1.     Pseudoization method for the characterization 

The pseudoization approach for petroleum fractions was developed in several research 

projects, independent of the kind of compound. 

Coats (1985) made an important contribution to connected computer simulation by 

creating a grouping of dummy components. This approach is known as pseudoization, and it aims 

to reduce the number of elements necessary to represent a fluid, reducing the computational 

effort. A pseudocomponent was defined primarily by its (pseudo) normal boiling temperature and 

by some other parameters, specifically the specific gravity (SG) and molar mass (M) or kinematic 

viscosity (?).  

Schlijper (1986) developed a method in which a pseudocomponent represented a 

mixture of components, and thus the thermodynamic behavior of the mixture was determined 

from the equation–of–state. 



40 

Miquel and Castells (1993, 1994) presented a computational methodology for predicting 

the properties of components of a mixture based on the hypothesis of constant Watson’s 

characterization factor, Kw, for all the pseudocomponents of the mixture. 

Beer (1994) described a method for the characterization of petroleum fractions and for 

the breakdown of pseudocomponents. This approach requires an inspection of the ASTM 

analyses or TBP (True Boiling Point) distillation curves as the input data. 

Riazi and Al–Sahhaf (1996) developed a generalized correlation for the properties of 

several homologous series of hydrocarbons in terms of their molar mass. This approach can be 

applied to hydrocarbons up to C50. 

Eckert and Van?k (2005) presented a brief description of the pseudoization approach for 

the characterization of petroleum fractions. 

Nichita et al. (2008) proposed an approach for the modeling of wax precipitation from 

hydrocarbon mixtures. The modeling requires extended compositional data for the high–boiling–

point petroleum fractions. The method is based on lumping into pseudocomponents, which 

reduces the dimensionality of the phase equilibrium calculations without affecting the location of 

the solid phase transitions.   

Satyro and Yarranton (2009) suggested a procedure based on the representation of the 

mixture of real components that boil within a certain boiling point interval, by hypothetical 

components that boil at the average normal boiling temperature. This procedure is advantageous, 

since it is completely general and is not based on a specific thermodynamic model for the 

mixture. 

 2.        Overview of the estimation of the physicochemical properties 

The physicochemical properties are perhaps one of the most important factors in both 

experimental and theoretical researches, since they are needed to predict the performance of the 

process, the behavior of the material under the operating conditions and the modeling and the 

simulation of the industrial processes.  

However, important limitations in the use of the methods are present, such as the 

availability of the input parameters e.g. some critical property of the petroleum fractions and the 

range of applicability of the methods. Thus, an inadequate estimation of the physicochemical 



 

41 

properties of the high–boiling–point petroleum fractions may result in low reliability of the 

prediction of the performance process under study (Riazi, 2004). Hence, specific methods for the 

estimation of the basic, thermodynamic, thermophysical and transport properties are given in the 

following sections. 

2.1.     Prediction of the basic properties 

2.1.1.     Characterization of the average boiling points 

High–boiling–point petroleum fractions, being mixtures of several compounds, present 

an average boiling point, which is inappropriate from the physical point of view, since volatility 

is associated with a single boiling point. However, even though it is considered inadequate to 

define the average boiling point of a mixture, this is the usual practice, because it allows the 

estimation of the properties of the petroleum fractions and petroleum cuts by standard industrial 

methods and for a correlation with values cited in the literature. Thus, Watson et al. (1935)

2.1.2.     Characterization factor 

The Watson characterization factor (Kw) or Universal Oil Products Company (UOP) 

characterization factor (KOUP) is the ratio of the cube root of the absolute boiling point (of a pure 



42 

component) or the average normal boiling point for petroleum cuts to the specific gravity. It is 

used as an approximate index of the paraffinicity of a petroleum cut, thus a high value for this 

index indicates a high percent of saturated pure components and paraffin components 

(Gharagheizi and Fazeli, 2008; Watson and Nelson, 1933). 

The Kw is defined as follows:

Where, Tb is the normal boiling point; and for whole petroleum fraction is the mean 

average boiling point (MeABP) (in Kelvin). Therefore, the SG is the ratio of its density (?) to the 

density of the water (?water) at 288.15 K (15.6 °C or 60 °F). 

2.2.     Estimation of the thermodynamic properties  

The critical properties (Tc, Pc, Vc and ?ac) of unknown mixtures can be estimated as a 

function of Tb and SG (Boozarjoomehry et al., 2005). The critical properties are parameters 

commonly used by process simulators in the design of unit operations and in the estimation of the 

thermophysical properties. Several methods have been proposed and some are presented in 

Equations (9) – (17) from Table 2. For estimating M, the methods available are very similar to 

those used in the determination of the critical properties, and use Tb and SG as the input 

parameters.

2.3.     Methods for estimating the thermophysical and transport properties 

In this section, methods available for estimating transport properties such as the 

kinematic viscosity (?) and thermal conductivity (?), and thermal properties such as the specific 

heat capacity (Cp) and vapor pressure (Pvap) of petroleum fractions are presented in Equations 

(21) – (29). These properties are essential for energy balances involved in chemical process unit 

and in the design of heat transfer equipment.   

2.3.1.     Estimation of transport properties 

2.3.1.1.  Generalized viscosity correlations 

Numerous estimation methods have been presented by researchers to show the effect of 

temperature on the kinematic viscosity (?). A review of viscosity estimation methods is given by 

Mehrotra et al. (1996) and some correlations with the use of SG and Tb as input data as in the 

present work, are presented in Equations (21) – (23) from Table 4.

As in the case of kinematic viscosity (?), the thermal conductivity (?) of high–boiling–

for predicting ? values based on the input data and in the range of applicability of the property, as 

presented in Equations (24) – (26) from Table 5.

2.3.2.1.  Specific heat capacity 

The specific heat capacity (Cp) (of liquid phase) is required when modeling based on 

mass, momentum and energy balances is to be carried out. It is sensitive to temperature variations 

and depends mainly on the type of molecular structure of the compounds involved. 

A summary of the calculation procedures used to estimate Cp (of liquid phase) is

2.3.2.2.  Vapor pressure 

Methods for calculating the vapor pressure (Pvap) of pure compounds or mixtures with 

known components are available in the book “The Properties of Gases and Liquids” (Poling et 

al., 2001) and in “The Design Institute for Physical Property Data – DIPPR” (Daubert et al., 

2000), using predictive correlations developed from experimental data, such as the Antoine or 

Wagner equations. Most of the procedures used for petroleum fractions were suggested for a 

narrow boiling range or are applicable to mixtures with a known composition (Panteli et al., 

2006). Nevertheless, a simple method for estimating the vapor pressure (Pvap) of high–boiling–

point petroleum fractions is presented in Equation (29) (Riazi, 2004).

3.        Computational framework 

3.1.      High–boiling–point petroleum fractions samples and data requirements 

High–boiling–point petroleum fractions are characterized by their SG or API gravity and 

BP curve,  parameters  well established in the ASTM D 287 (2006),  ASTM D 1298 (2005) and 

ASTM D 2892 (2005) standard methods, respectively. Three Brazilian crude oils with different 

API gravities (16 – 25 °API), obtained from separate sources, and distilled by conventional 

atmospheric distillation (ASTM D 2892, 2005), providing three atmospheric distillation residues 

(ATR–W, ATR–Y and ATR–Z), were studied in the present work. The BP curves were obtained 

in the Petrobras Research and Development Center (CENPES–Brazil) and are represented by 

pairs of points of accumulated distilled volume versus temperature as presented in Table 7.

3.2.     Pseudocomponent breakdown methodology 

The range of the BP curve was cut in order to obtain non–overlapping temperature 

intervals, continuously covering the temperature range according to the integral mean 

temperature of the corresponding interval of the distilled fraction (Eckert and Van?k, 2005).  

Whitson and Brulé (2000) and Eckert and Van?k (2005) pointed out that it is sufficient 

to use about 15 K for normal boiling points up to 700 K, about 30 K for between 700 and 950 K 

and about 50 K for higher boiling point mixtures. Thus, each temperature interval represents one 

pseudocomponent with a normal boiling point, defined by the integral mean temperature over the 

corresponding interval of the distilled fraction, as described in Equations (30) – (31) (Eckert and 

Van?k, 2005; Miquel and Castells, 1993; Beer, 1994).

T is the normal boiling point of pseudocomponent i in Kelvin. 

3.3.     Correlations and predictive technique availability 

In this study, a pseudoization method is presented to relate the basic properties (boiling 

point (Tb), specific gravity (SG) and Watson factor characterization (Kw)), to the thermodynamic 

properties (critical temperature (Tc), critical pressure (Pc), critical volume (Vc) and acentric factor 

(?ac)) and to thermophysical and transport properties (thermal conductivity (?), specific heat 

capacity (Cp), kinematic viscosity (?) and vapor pressure (Pvap)) of high–boiling–point petroleum 

fractions. 

The development of the pseudocomponent approach presented in this work was based 

on the procedure suggested by Lion and Edmister (1975) and Miquel and Castells (1994, 1993), 

assuming Kw to be constant, that is, the same for each pseudocomponent and calculated using 

Equation (7). Thus, the liquid density (
i

? ) (at 288.75 K) of each pseudocomponent (NPSE) could 

be estimated using Equation (32) (Miquel and Castells, 1994; 1993).

The computational tool used to develop the pseudoization computational approach and 

to analyze the physicochemical properties of the high–boiling–point petroleum fractions was built 

up in FORTRAN–90 language using Compaq Visual Fortran compiler (professional edition 6.6).

Figure 1. Computational environment to estimate the basic, the thermodynamic and the thermophysical properties of 

heavy petroleum fractions. 

 

(a) High–boiling–point petroleum fractions data environment–Input data  

The user has to introduce the BP distillation data and the whole fraction density. 



 

50 

(b) Internal procedures data environment–Input parameter 

 Within the computational framework some information is required in order to apply the 

numerical methods for interpolation, obtain the trial–and–error numerical solution and present 

information in the output report. Hence, the input parameter required are: Degree of lagrange's 

interpolation polynomial (NDEGR) based on the fact that a polynomial fitting lower than third 

order defining the BP curve is recommended as a procedure to estimate the accumulated distilled 

volume values for each distilling temperature (Pasquini and Bueno, 2007); number of 

pseudocomponents (NPSE); number of input data for the BP data (NDATA), maximum number 

of iterations (NITER), total interpolated data on BP curve to be presented in output report (NN). 

(c) Pseudocomponent breakdown environment 

This environment computes the integral boiling point (Tbi) using Equation (31). It consists of 

three subroutines called: SIMPSON, INTERP and LAGRANP (Miquel and Castells, 1994, 1993). 

(d) Basic characterization environment 

The procedure for estimating the basic properties is described in Miquel and Castells (1993) as 

follows. 

Stage 1: Compute the Tbi of each pseudocomponent predefined in the input data 

parameters environment, using Equation (31). 

Stage 2: This subroutine requires a starting value for the mean average boiling point 

(MeABP) as follows:

MeABP T=  (33) 

Stage 3: Estimate Kw (Equation 7) and the pseudocomponent liquid density (?i) 

(Equation 32) based on the starting value for MeABP*. 

Stage 4: Calculate the molar (xmi) fraction of each pseudocomponent (i) using the 

correlation in Equation (34) as follows:

Stage 5: Calculate the molar–, cubic– and mean–average boiling points (MABP, CABP 

and MeABP) of the whole fraction using Equations (3), (5) – (6) in Table 1. 

Stage 6: If the absolute difference between the MeABP value obtained in stage 5 and 

stage 1 is larger than 0.001, assign the new value for MeABP obtained in stage 5 and go back to 

step stage 1; on convergence, then proceed to stage 7. 

Stage 7: Assign the normal boiling point (Tbi), density (?i), volume, and molar 

concentrations (xvi and xmi, respectively) to each pseudocomponent. 

(e) Thermodynamic characterization environment 

The thermodynamic properties (M, Tc and Pc) and acentric factor (?ac) are estimated from 

correlations shown in Tables 2 – 3, which are denoted according to the coded numbers: -1, 0 or 1 

for M, Tc and Pc, respectively, and -1 or 0 for the ?ac correlations (Table 8).

Aiming to obtain the best set of correlations, an optimization subroutine for 

minimization of the mass– and molar– balance errors was included. Hence, based on a set of 

twenty five (25) pseudocomponents, all possible combinations between these correlations were 

defined (see Figure 2). From the subroutine for basic properties estimation, assigned the normal 

boiling point (Tbi), density (?i), volume, and molar concentrations (xvi and xmi, respectively) to 

each pseudocomponent, compute critical properties (Tci and Pci), acentric factor (?aci), molar 

mass (Mi) and Watson’s characterization factor (Kw) of the pseudocomponent and compute whole 

fraction critical properties (Tc and Pc), acentric factor (?ac) and molar mass (M) using MeABP 

and ?. Subsequent, compute the pseudocomponent–breakdown mass– and molar– balance error 

using Equations (35) – (36) (Beer, 1994; Miquel and Castells, 1994, 1993) as follows:

At this stage, the solution was reached when the mass– and molar– balance errors were 

minimized. Table 9 presents the result obtained for the ATR–W and analogous data were 

obtained for ATR–Y and ATR–Z.

On the other hand, mass– and molar– balance error were analyzed. Hence, the results for 

the mass– and molar– balance errors (Emass and Emol) presented in Table 9 for the ATR–W case 

study showed that the choice of ?ac correlation appears to have no influence on the reliability of 

the thermodynamic properties. Following, considering the Kesler and Lee (1976) and Lee and 

Kesler (1975) correlation, coded with –1, for the estimation of ?ac, analyses were 

performed establishing the possible combinations among the set of correlations to estimate the 



 

53 

thermodynamic properties (M, Tc and Pc) and the number of interpolated data on the BP curve 

(input data) being ten (10) or twenty one (21). 

 In order to accomplish the best set of correlations, data from Emass and Emol constituted 

an array of two vectors (called mass_vector and molar_vector) which were used in a subroutine 

to choose the minimum value in the arrays. 

(f) Thermophysical and transport characterization environment 

A final subroutine estimates the thermal conductivity (?), the specific heat capacity (Cp) 

the kinematic viscosity (?) and the vapor pressure (Pvap) of each pseudocomponent as a function 

of the temperature (T), using the normal boiling point (Tbi) (for pseudocomponents) or MeABP 

(for whole fractions) as the input data. The methods presented in Equations (21) – (28) from 

Tables 4 – 6 and Equation (29) are included in this module.  

(g) Reliability of the pseudoization approach environment 

The success of the method is based on the accuracy of the empirical or semi–empirical 

correlations in the literature and the standard industrial methods. Hence, the reliability of the 

basic and thermodynamic properties is calculated from the mass and molar balance equations 

(Equations 35 – 36) (Beer, 1994; Miquel and Castells, 1994, 1993). The thermophysical 

properties were compared with the experimental data obtained in the research laboratories using 

the methods described in the next section. Data computed were evaluated in terms of average 

absolute deviation (AAD%) which is define as a relation among the absolute deviation of 

estimating a quantity divided by its experimental value (yi,ref) as presented in Equation (1).  

4.        Experimental data 

4.1.     Thermal analyses: differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) 

The DSC experiments were carried out on the high–boiling–point petroleum fractions 

using a Mettler–Toledo DSC 823e thermal analysis system (Mettler Toledo GmbH, Germany), 

and liquid nitrogen was used for cooling. The DSC module was calibrated with indium standard 

(It had a certified fusion temperature of 156.6 ± 0.3 °C and heat flow calibration of 

28.45 ± 0.6 J·g
?1

). The experiments were carried out with a sample size of ~10 mg. The samples 

were weighed into open aluminum pans, hermetically sealed and then placed in the sample 

chamber of the DSC module. The reference was an identical, empty pan, with an equal weight 



 

54 

matched within ±0.1 mg. A linear heating rate of 25 K·min
-1

 was used over the temperature range 

from 350 to 600 K, with a nitrogen flow of 50 mL·min
-1

 controlled by a gas control system 

(Mettler–Toledo TS0800GC1). The STAR
e 

(V 9.01)
 
software was used to provide an estimate of 

the enthalpy ( H? ), the heat flow and specific heat capacity. 

In order to evaluate the repeatability of the measurement, the relative standard deviation 

(%RSD) with respect to the mean signal of each measurement, calculated over three (03) 

consecutive repetitions of Indium standard was examined. The value obtained was lower than 

8.53%. 

4.2.     Rheological measurements 

The rheological analyses were carried out in a Thermo Scientific Haake Rheostress 6000 

rotational rheometer (Gebrüder HAAKE GmbH, Germany) interfaced with an electric cone 

heating system UTCE/C, using 2 parallel plates of 0.035 m and setting the gap set at 1.0x10
-3

 m.  

Two measuring techniques were applied. The first rheological measurements refers to 

the analyses of  transition between pseudoplastic and Newtonian flow obtained from an analysis 

of the flow curve prepared using the controlled rate mode at 383.15 and 363.15 K  and at the 

shear rate range from 10 to 700 s
-1

 with  measurements being made every 10 s
-1

. The flow 

behavior and dynamic viscosity (µ) of the ATR–W, ATR–Y and ATR–Z was investigated over a 

wide range of shear rates at 383.15 K (for ATR–W) and 363.15 K (for ATR–Y and ATR–Z). 

Three runs were done for each material, and the resulting shear stress was the three experimental 

averages values. The results were recorded and fitted to the Newtonian models.  

The experimental data were evaluated and fitted according to the rheological Newtonian 

model, using the average shear stress (?) value for each shear rate (?).  High–boiling–point 

petroleum fractions found to follow Newtonian behavior based on the yield stress of the oils 

(Table 10). It can be observed that the shear stress is proportional to the shear rate (Newtonian 

behavior) which mean that the dynamic viscosity (µ) is constant and independent from the shear 

rate at constant temperature (test temperature). 

The other rheological measurement was focus on the sweep measurements in the 

temperature range from 473.15 K to 343.15 K with the heating rates of 2 K·min
-1

 at constant 

frequency and constant shear stress (100 s
-1

). The temperature was controlled, in both cases, to 



 

55 

allow a maximum deviation of ±0.5 K. All experiments were carried out under an oxidizing 

atmosphere using air.

5.        Results and discussion 

5.1.     Simulated boiling point data and pseudocomponent distribution 

The pseudocomponents were selected considering the need to represent the behavior of 

the mixture over the entire computational effort and availability of the input data. The most 

advantageous number of pseudocomponents to satisfactorily fit the data was determined by the 

trial–and–error exercise through applying a sensibility procedure in which the mass– and molar–

balance errors were minimized. In this sense, Table 11 summarizes the sensibility exercise and 

establishes that twenty five (25) pseudocomponents are required to avoid excessive 

computational effort but guaranteeing the accuracy to estimate physicochemical properties of 

petroleum fractions.

The results in Figure 3 are presented to show the response of the computational 

approach using the pseudoization method with twenty five (25) pseudocomponents, in relation to 



 

57 

the representation of the input data. Figure 3 shows the comparison between the simulated BP 

curve and the experimental data obtained from CENPES–PETROBRAS. The initial and final 

boiling points were set from 300 to 1300 K for ATR–W, from 650 to 800 K for ATR–Y, and 

from 350 and 850 K for ATR–Z, respectively.

representing average boiling point ranges of 40 K, 6 K and 20 K for ATR–W, ATR–Y and ATR–

Z, respectively) good agreement was obtained reporting an AAD% of just 1.74, 0.89 and 1.75% 

for ATR–W, ATR–Y and ATR–Z, respectively (Table 12). 

It is of interest to note in Figure 3 that the simulated and experimental BP values, based 

on the chemical analysis, are effectively identical up to approximately 80% v/v distillation. 

Hence, the boiling temperature curve above 80% v/v and below 3% v/v of distillation, 

represented an extrapolation, and some possible deviations could occur, since there are no data to 

match them up. However, it can be seen that the results of the extrapolation still show the cubic 

polynomial trend of the experimental data provided by CENPES–PETROBRAS, the volume 

fractions being arranged in a cumulative distribution of the volume fraction, as expected.

The methodology for distributing the complex bulk liquid into pseudocomponent 

compositions is shown in Figure 4. The results show that most of the components are 

concentrated in the first–cuts for ATR–W and ATR–Y (Figure 4a – 4b), and in the end–cut for 

ATR–Z (Figure 4c).

5.2.     Determination of the basic and thermodynamic properties  

Properties of high–boiling–point petroleum fractions are estimated based on the 

computational procedure presented in this work, where the BP curve and the density of the whole 

fraction are the input bulk properties. The determination of the basic properties of the high–

boiling–point petroleum fractions involved the cube of the average boiling point (CABP), the 

mean average boiling point (MeABP), the molar average boiling point (MABP) and the Watson 



 

61 

characterization factor (Kw) (Table 13). The Kw is an approximate index of the paraffinicity of a 

petroleum fraction. The high values obtained for this index for ATR–W, ATR–Y and ATRZ 

(Kw=11.94, Kw=12.18 and Kw=11.79, respectively) indicated a high percent of pure saturated 

components and paraffin components.

Comparing the values of the average boiling points (Table 13), it appears that the 

MeABP was always lesser than the CABP, since the relationship between the density and molar 

mass increased as the boiling point decreased. This implies in an increase in the relative 

importance of the fractions with lower boiling points and lower average molar masses, reducing 

the value of the MeABP. Conversely, MeABP was lager than MABP, and thus there was a relative 

increase in the importance of the fractions with higher boiling points due to the increase in 

density with increase in boiling point. Moreover, it is important to estimate the average boiling 

points, and specifically the MeABP, for use in the correlations used to estimate the various 

thermodynamic and thermophysical properties. 

5.2.1.     Density and molar mass distributions in the pseudocomponents 

On the other hand, both the molar mass (M) and the density (?) are fundamental physical 

properties that can be used in conjunction with other physical properties to characterize the ATR–

W, ATR–Y and ATR–Z petroleum fractions. Figure 5 presents the values for molar mass (MNPSE) 

and density (?NPSE) as a function of the normal boiling point (Tbi) for the pseudocomponents. 

From Figure 5a, it is evident that, in the case of ATR–W, both these properties increase with an 

increment in Tbi.

However, Figure 5 also shows that the value for MNPSE decreases significantly as the API 

gravity (°API) of the fraction increases, which is followed by a more gradual change in MNPSE 

with the increase in ?NPSE. Such behavior is to be expected, since, as Tbi increases MNPSE  and 

?NPSE rise correspondingly. 

5.2.2.     Critical properties 

The availability of critical data for complex mixtures such as high–boiling–point 

petroleum fractions is insufficient, due to the experimental conditions required and the fact that 

they can not be measured directly (Korsten, 1998). In this study, a computational framework was 

presented with respect to reliable methods for predicting the critical properties based on the mass 

and molar balance errors (Equations 35 – 36). 

 



 

63 

5.2.2.1.  Reliable critical property correlations 

Table 14 presents the available correlations introduced in this work, to estimate the 

critical properties (Equations 9 – 17 from Table 2) by means of a computational environment 

using the pseudocomponent approach, based on the fact that in predicting the ?ac, the choice of 

correlation appears to have no influence on the reliability of the thermodynamic properties. 

Hence, the results for the mass and molar balance errors (Emass and Emol) presented in Table 14 for 

the ATR–W, ATR–Y and ATR–Z case studies, are for a set of twenty five (25) 

pseudocomponents obtained using the correlation presented by Kesler and Lee (1976) and Lee 

and Kesler (1975), and coded with -1 for the estimation of ?ac. Table 14 established that the 

number of interpolated data used to predict the BP curve appeared to have no influence, since the 

variation between the balance errors was minimal when considering ten (10) and twenty one (21) 

data.

Thus for the system adopted using twenty one (21) interpolated points, the combination 

of the correlations of Kesler and Lee (1976) and Lee and Kesler (1975), coded with -1, for the 

estimation of ?ac, and of Riazi and Daubert (1980), coded with 0, for the prediction of M, Tc, Pc, 

represents a great choice in the estimation of the thermodynamic properties of high–boiling–point 

petroleum fractions, when the values for the boiling point and density of the fraction as input data 

are available, since  the errors in mass balance were 2.73% for ATR–W, 0.71% for ATR–Y and 

1.12% for ATR–Z, and the errors in molar balance were 8.60% for ATR–W; 2.03% for ATR–Y 

and 2.92% for ATR–Z.

5.2.2.2.  Data for the pseudocritical properties of high–boiling–point petroleum fractions 

The critical temperature (Tc), critical pressure (Pc), critical volume (Vc) and acentric 

factor (?ac) represent four widely used constants in physicochemical characterizations, process 

modeling and unit operation studies. These critical constants are very important properties in the 

physicochemical characterization of petroleum fractions, since almost all the thermophysical 

properties are estimated from the boiling point and critical constant data. 

In the present work, the term pseudocritical properties were introduced to identify the 

effective values for the critical properties (such as temperature, pressure and volume) of the 

multicomponent chemical systems, ATR–W, ATR–Y and ATR–Z. Thus, the pseudocritical 

properties refer to the estimation of the critical properties of a set of pseudocomponents. 

However, the true critical properties are those calculated using the associated mixing rules. 

It can be seen in Figure 6 that the pseudocritical temperature (TcNPSE) increased with the  

increase in the value for Tbi, but the pseudocritical pressure (PcNPSE) (Figure 7) and the density 

(ratio between molar mass (MNPSE) and critical volume (VcNPSE)) decreased (Figure 8) as the MNPSE 

and ?NPSE increased.  

On the other hand, ?ac is a concept that was introduced by Pitzer et al.  (1955) and has 

proved to be important in the physicochemical characterization of petroleum fractions (Shouzhi 

et al., 2005). The value for ?ac is said to be a measure of the non–sphericity (acentricity). Values 

for ?ac can be determined from the Tc, Pc and Tbi data. In the present work, the Edmister 

(Edmister, 1958) and Lee–Kesler (Kesler and Lee, 1976;  Lee and Kesler, 1975) methods were 

evaluated, but only the Lee–Kesler approach was reported (Figure 9). Figure 9 illustrates the 

dependence of ?ac on Tbi and ?i for the set of twenty five (25) pseudocomponents of ATR–W, 

ATR–Y and ATR–Z. A nearly linear variation of this property with the increasing number of 

carbons can be seen, since the value for Tbi increased, and consequently the value for ?i rose. 

Therefore, as confirmed by Ourique and Telles (1997), it is reasonable to state that the estimation 

of ?ac must be a function of the structural and functional groups, but correlations to relate the 

structures and ?ac are often limited to specific hydrocarbon compounds.

5.3.     Thermophysical properties of the whole fractions 

Figures 10 – 13 present the thermophysical properties for the three Brazilian high–

boiling–point petroleum fractions (ATR–W, ATR–Y and ATR–Z), calculated in a temperature 

range from 350 to 600 K according to the semi–theoretical method mentioned in Equations (21) – 

(29). Data computed were compared with the experimental data. 

5.3.1.     Transport properties  

5.3.1.1.  Kinematic Viscosity 

The estimation of kinematic viscosity (?) was carried out using two correlations 

(Equations 22 and 23) aiming to compare the methods with respect to the experimental data 

(Figure 10 and Table 15). Thus, the methods employed varied with the type of fraction analyzed. 

The comparison of these different methods showed that they produced consistent results with 

each other.

Several factors are responsible for the viscosity of oil and its fractions. In the specific case study 

approached here, the viscosity showed a general trend to decrease with increasing temperature 

and increase with increasing pressure and density, and it also depended on the molecular structure 

of the hydrocarbons. According to this, it was found that the value for ? increased for 

pseudocomponents with the high molar mass. This was because the flow was facilitated by the 

possibility of larger flexibility or deformation of molecules that have a smaller number of carbons 

in their compositions. With respect to this question, the presence of certain functional groups 

capable of forming hydrogen bonds leads to an increase in the intermolecular size, even resulting 

in an increase in ?, such as, for example, in the ATR–Y case study, since it is rich in asphaltene 

chains. 

Reliable correlations that are capable of estimating the value of ? for undefined high–

boiling–point petroleum fractions (ATR–W, ATR–Y and ATR–Z), using the minimum input 

information, were used. Simulated data were compared with experimental data obtained in the 

research laboratories. The Aboul–Seoud and Moharam (1999a) correlation (Equation 23) gives 

overall average absolute deviation percents (AAD%) of 2.54%, 3.78% and 3.71% for ATR–W, 

ATR–Y and ATR–Z, respectively, in comparison with the method of Mehrotra (1995) (Equation 

22) that gave values of 25.64%, 22.52% and 27.64%, respectively, for the average absolute 

deviation percentages (AAD%). Thus, Equation (23) provides more accurate results than Equation 

(22) as proposed by Mehrotra (1995), since Equation (23) requires more input information and 

the improvement in AAD% justifies the endeavor to introduce the SG as an input parameter, 

especially when it is readily available, together with the MeABP (for the whole fraction) and Tbi 

(for the pseudocomponents), to characterize the undefined high–boiling–point petroleum 

fractions and its pseudocomponents.

5.3.1.2.  Thermal Conductivity  

Thermal conductivity (?) is an important property of high–boiling–point petroleum 

fractions and it is defined from the quantity of heat transmitted due to a unit temperature gradient 

in a unit area under steady state conditions. It is of large importance, since heat–transfer 

coefficients are usually computed using correlations that require thermal conductivity data. In 

process engineering, a number of methods have been published for estimating the thermal 

conductivity of high–boiling–point petroleum fractions at normal pressure. In this study, two 

methods have been investigated and compared with the experimental data (Figure 11). 

 

 

Figure 11. Thermal conductivity ( ? ) as function of temperature ( T ) for a) ATR–W, b) ATR–Y and c) ATR–Z and comparison 
with experimental data (?). 

 

Figure 11 shows the ? plot using both the Riazi and Faghri (1985) (Equation 24 from 

Table 5) and also Aboul–Seoud and Moharam (1999b) (Equation 26 from Table 5) methods. It 



 

71 

was showed that the second method provided better correspondence and it can be considered 

more accurate than the other correlations for the ATR–Y and ATR–Z fractions. In Figure 11, a 

comparison was made with the data for ? obtained for the high–boiling–point petroleum fractions 

by DSC experiments. Using the method of Aboul–Seoud and Moharam (1999b), values of 5.84, 

5.19 and 9.01 AAD%, were obtained for ATR–W, ATR–Y and ATR–Z, respectively, when 

compared with the values of 10.73, 1.39 and 4.05 AAD% for ATR–W, ATR–Y and ATR–Z 

obtained using the Riazi and Faghri (1985) method (Table 16). 

5.3.2.     Thermal properties 

5.3.2.1.  Specific heat capacity 

The specific heat capacities (Cp) for ATR–W, ATR–Y and ATR–Z were plotted in 

Figure 12 for a temperature range between 350 and 600 K. For these samples, a strong 

temperature dependence of the Cp was observed in the range considered. It is apparent from 

Figure 12 that the Cp of the fractions increased linearly with an increase in temperature for all the 

fractions. The difference in Cp amongst the high–boiling–point petroleum fractions was due to 

differences in the chemical composition. In general, the specific heat capacity might have a 

general effect on density and on the nature of the compounds in the mixture. 

The specific heat capacities (Cp) data were evaluated in terms of average absolute 

deviation (AAD%) where the absolute deviation was defined as the difference between the 

experimental value (yi,ref) obtained from experimental studies and the data predicted by the 

computational approach (yi,cal) (Table 16). Moreover, the results predicted were entirely 

consistent with those obtained experimentally in the research laboratories (LDPS/LOPCA), in 

which conventional differential scanning calorimetrry (DSC) was employed. For ATR–W, the 

method of  Kesler and Lee (1976) gave an overall average absolute deviation (AAD%) of 2.61%, 

as compared to 8.65% for the  Watson and Nelson (1933) method; for ATR–Y the method of 

Kesler and Lee (1976)  gave 9.72 % as compared to 12.19% for the Watson and Nelson (1933) 

method, and for ATR–Z the method of Kesler and Lee (1976) gave 8.58 % AAD as compared to 

13.00% for the Watson and Nelson (1933) method (Table 16).

5.3.2.2.  Predicted vapor pressure 

Vapor pressure (Pvap) predictions as a function of temperature were carried out using 

Equation (29). As a general trend, the relation between Pvap and temperature is non–linear. The 

Pvap of the samples, at a given temperature, increases as the value for MeABP increases. This is 

illustrated in the vapor pressure chart that shows graphs of Pvap versus temperature for ATR–W, 

ATR–Y and ATR–Z (Figure 13). For example, at a given temperature (at 450 K), the ATR–W 

sample showed the highest vapor pressure as compared to the other samples in the chart. It also 

had the highest MeABP, equal to 819.7 K. 

However, the vapor pressure of a liquid increases as the temperature increases in a non–

linear relation as shown in Figure 13 for ATR–W, ATR–Y and ATR–Z, respectively. As the 

temperature increased, the molecular kinetic energy of the molecules increased, and thus more 

molecules can escape from the liquid phase to the vapor phase. Accordingly, as the temperature 

increased, so did the Pvap.  

 

Figure 13. Vapor pressure (
vap

P ) of whole fraction as a function of temperature ( T ). ATR–W (?), ATR–Y (?) and ATR–Z (?). 

At constant temperature and pressure, existing inter–molecular forces of the substance 

are the determining factors of the Pvap. The effect of M on Pvap is depicted in Figure 13. At a 

given temperature (at 400 K) the vapor pressures for ATR–W, ATR–Y and ATR–Z differed due 

to differences in the length of their hydrocarbon chains and the type of intermolecular forces, 

namely London dispersion forces. This type of intermolecular force is related to the molecular 

size and has some connection with the molar mass (M).  



 

75 

Nevertheless, possible non–polar pseudocomponents present in ATR–W and ATR–Y 

have relatively small intermolecular forces (no hydrogen bounding and/or dipole–dipole forces), 

and thus these samples have a relatively high Pvap when compared with the ATR–Z fraction.  

6.        Conclusions 

The computational approach has shown to be a powerful and efficient tool to predict the 

physicochemical properties of petroleum fractions. The method requires a boiling point curve and 

the specific gravity as the input data information. This method focuses specifically on high–

boiling–point petroleum fractions and the selection of the right characterization method has an 

important effect on the properties calculated. Moreover, the computational procedure can be 

combined with or incorporated into petroleum process simulations or assist studies about 

petroleum processing by providing an easy and accurate method for characterization of petroleum 

fraction properties with lower computational effort. 

The critical properties were assayed by way of an optimization exercise to obtain the 

best set of correlations for estimating the molar mass (M), critical properties (Tc, Pc) and acentric 

factor (?ac). Accordingly, a set established by Equations (12) – (14) (coded by 0) and Equation 

(19) (coded by -1) comprised the correlations with which it was possible to obtain the lowest 

mass and molar balance errors. 

The critical properties such as critical temperature (Tc) and critical pressure (Pc) were 

sensitive to the normal boiling point (Tbi) and density (?i) of the pseudocomponents. For higher 

values of Tbi, the value for TcNPSE increased, but the value for PcNPSE and the ratio between MNPSE and 

VcNPSE decreased. This result reflects the relationship between the thermodynamic properties and 

the amount of hydrocarbons and type of chains amongst them. 

A set of reliable correlations can be used to estimate the thermophysical and transport 

properties with a minimal number of input data such as the MeABP (mean average boiling point), 

in the case of a whole petroleum fraction or Tbi (normal boiling point) for each pseudocomponent, 

together the SG (specific gravity). The proposed method seems to be simple and flexible. The 

data computed were in good agreement with the experimental data obtained in the research 

laboratories, since the ADD% was lower than 10%. Hence, the model of Aboul–Seoud and 

Moharam (1999b) for the prediction of the thermal conductivity (?) of high–boiling–point 

petroleum fractions, which requires as input information the value of Tb, was evaluated in this 



 

76 

work and compared with that of Riazi and Faghri (1985). The model of Aboul–Seoud and 

Moharam (1999b) provided satisfactory results, which were much better than those obtained with 

the second model since good agreement between the predicted and experimental values has been 

found, with an overall absolute deviation of 5.84, 5.19 and 9.01 % for ATR–W, ATR–Y and 

ATR–Z, respectively.  

Aboul–Seoud and Moharam (1999a) method, Equation (23), showed the lowest standard 

deviation (below 5%) for predicting the kinematic viscosity (?) values of the analyzed high–

boiling–point petroleum fractions in the Newtonian range from 350 to 600 K, when compared 

with the Mehrotra (1995) method (Equation 22). 

The results obtained for the specific heat capacity (Cp) for the selected high–boiling–

point petroleum fractions (ATR–W, ATR–Y and ATR–Z) provided reliable data using the 

correlation proposed by Kesler and Lee (1976), since the values for the AAD% were 2.61%, 

9.72% and 8.58% for ATR–W, ATR–Y and ATR–Z, respectively. 

In this work, a simple correlation was used for the estimation of the vapor pressure (Pvap) 

of the high–boiling–point petroleum fractions, where only the boiling point (Tb) and the 

temperature (T) are required.

Development &amp;amp; application of continuous thermodynamic to predict 

physicochemical properties of petroleum fractions 

Abstract  

In studies to predict the physicochemical properties of petroleum fractions (mixture of 

hydrocarbons), the general practice in the petroleum industry is divided mathematically this 

fractions into a group of narrow boiling range which enables to assign properties to these 

pseudocomponents. However, the tracking of all pseudocomponents, which are more than 

20.000, of petroleum fractions would involve enormous computational efforts. 

This work presents an approach for characterizing the petroleum fractions as a 

continuous distribution functions. Calculations by continuous thermodynamics approach are 

developed where distilled volume data and the specific gravities are the input data; normal 

boiling point is the distribution variable and the distribution function is the boiling point curve 

that already had the temperature experimental data converted to atmospheric equivalent 

temperature – AET. Thermodynamic, transport and thermophysical properties are related to 

boiling point by well–established petroleum methods proposed by available correlations and 

industry standard methods. 

The computational results indicated that the continuous thermodynamic method is an 

accurate technique for predicting the physicochemical properties of petroleum fractions. 

Continuous thermodynamics provides a potentially useful tool for petroleum industry to increase 

the computational speed and accuracy because it is not necessary to characterize various families 

of hydrocarbons which may be present in the petroleum fraction.       

Keywords: Continuous thermodynamics, continuous mixture, generalized distribution function, 

petroleum fractions characterization.

1.        Introduction 

A complex mixture is defined as one in which various families of compounds, with 

diverse molar mass, are present (Manafi et al., 1999). Petroleum fraction is a hydrocarbon 

mixture of unknown composition and of a wide boiling range. Hence, petroleum fractions may 

present some difficulties in the estimation of its physicochemical properties because: (i) The 

computation time increases when it is considered a great number of pseudocomponents (Shibata 

et al., 1987); (ii) The information about the type of the mixture (e.g. paraffinic or aromatic), or 

the type of some of its components (e.g. polar or non–polar) could not be easily utilized  (Shibata 

et al., 1987;  Vakili–Nezhaad et al., 2001) and (iii) The characterization of the mixture could be 

incomplete (Shibata et al., 1987). 

In the present work, an accurate and efficient computational method, which reduces 

significantly the difficulties mentioned above, is presented for estimation of petroleum fractions 

physicochemical properties. Such approach is defined as thermodynamic of continuous mixture 

in which, a function of measurable property, such normal boiling point (Tb), specific gravity (SG) 

or molar mass (M), is introduced to describe composition of multicomponent mixtures.

1.1.     Distribution function 

The formulation of the continuous thermodynamic based on functional analysis, has 

been developed by several researchers in their works about description of the composition of 

multicomponent mixtures occurring in petroleum processes (or any other complex mixture); 

representation of physicochemical properties and phase equilibrium calculations of mixtures 

where number of chemical species is very large (Manafi et al., 1999;  Vakili–Nezhaad et al., 

2001; Cotterman et al., 1985;  Cotterman and Prausnitz, 1985;  Kehlen et al., 1985;  Fang and 

Lei, 2003;  Riazi, 1989;  Briesen and Marquardt, 2003, 2004). Complex mixtures may be 

represented by: (i) Continuous and discrete components, which is usually called semicontinuous 

mixture (Lage, 2007;  Koral et al., 1993), and, (ii) Continuous mixture which composition of all 

chemical species are described by continuous distribution functions. 

In continuous thermodynamics, a distribution function, instead of mole or weight 

fraction, is used to represent the composition of complex mixture (Vakili–Nezhaad et al., 2001;  

Riazi , 1989). Some of the well–known equations for continuous description are presented in 

Table 1, where I is the distribution variable and

2.1.     Petroleum fractions and data requirements 

Three different petroleum fractions (ATR–W, ATR–Y and ATR–Z) have been studied. 

The API gravity degrees of those samples were between 16 – 25. These information were 

provided by the Petrobras Research and Development Center (CENPES–Brazil). 

2.2.     Development Method 

The generalized relation proposed by Riazi has been applied for representing the boiling 

point distribution and it has the following form (Riazi et al., 2004;  Riazi, 1989): 

( ) ( )( )

Therefore, the distribution function has the property that:

Rearranging and differentiating with respect to I* Equation (4), the probability density

2.3.     Adjustment and optimization of model parameters 

Equation (4) has three distribution parameters (A, B and I0), where A and I0 are 

parameters specific for each property and each sample; and B is the parameter specific for each 

property but the same for all samples (these value is BT=1.5)
 
(Riazi et al., 2004). The adjustable 

model parameters (A and I0) were estimated by the FORTRAN subroutine RNLIN, available 

from IMSL MATH/LIBRARY. It uses a modified Levenberg–Marquardt method. For obtaining a 

suitable initial guess, of the A and I0, has been used PIKAIA sub–routine which is a genetic–

algorithm–based optimization sub–routine developed at the High Altitude Observatory, and 

available in the public domain (Metcalfe and Charbonneau, 2003). The genetic algorithm is 

capable of a much faster search than might be expected, when compared to classical (analytical 

or numerical) methods. Furthermore, it is reasonably simple to develop and represent a global 

search method. The typical objective function C(x) is presented as follows:

Initial population includes 120 individuals. The initial mutation rate, defined as the probability 

that any one gene locus will mutate in any one generation, is set at 0.005. In addition, the

crossover probability equals 0.85 and elitist function is not employed. After 2000 generations, the 

optimal solution of the suitable initial guess for the adjustable parameters of Equation (4) (A and 

I0) is obtained and estimated parameters are shown in Table 4.

determined experimentally too, by standard methodologies.

3.1.     Evaluation of the proposed method 

The distribution model proposed by Riazi (Riazi et al., 2004;  Riazi, 1989) was 

examined with different distribution functions represented by Equations (1) – (3). These 

equations were used for estimating the normal boiling point curve of petroleum fractions studied. 

The absolute average deviation, often expressed as a percentage (AAD%), it is shown in Table 3. 

The absolute deviation (Equation 13) is defined as the difference between the observed value 

(yi,ref) and the response predicted by the distribution functions at each operating condition (yi,cal) 

into the interval input data reported in Table 4 defined by the deflection exhibited in the boiling 

point curves obtained in the Petrobras Research and Development Center (CENPES–Brazil) 

represented by pairs of points of accumulated distilled volume versus temperature.

 From these evaluations, it is clear that Equation (4) had the minimum %ADD compared 

with Equations (1) – (3). Accordingly, the distribution function from Equation (4) was used in 

this work.

3.3.     Distribution functions for the boiling point of petroleum fractions 

Since, the chemical composition of the petroleum fractions is well represented and 

related to the volatility of the components; the normal boiling point was used as a distribution 

variable. Figure 1 shows the boiling point distribution from Equation (4) and Figure 2 shows the 

probability density function for the normal boiling point from Equation (7).

Results obtained using continuous thermodynamic indicated that normal boiling point 

distribution was consistent with those data provided by CENPES–Brazil and it was more accurate 

than pseudocomponent approach, once the %AADs estimated were 1.74%, 0.58% and 1.14% for 

ATR–W, ATR–Y and ATR–Z, respectively, in comparison with 8.06%, 2.03% and 2.92%, in 

that order, when pseudocomponent method was used.

3.4.     Thermodynamic characterization of petroleum fractions 

As described by Korsten (Korsten, 1998), both, critical properties and molar mass are 

two necessary parameters in the prediction of molecular–type analysis (paraffin, naphthenic or 

aromatic content) as a function of normal boiling point (Figures 3 – 5). 

 

 



 

91 

     

 

Figure 3. Probability distribution function. a) ATR–W; b) ATR–Y and c) ATR–Z. 

 

Once normal boiling point distribution for whole mixture was known, it was possible to 

obtain the properties through correlations presented in Table 2. Bulk properties (Figure 3) and 

critical properties (Figures 4 – 5), are required for predicting the thermophysical properties. In 

Figures 3 – 5 the molar mass distribution and critical properties were compared with the 

pseudocomponents approach. Inside the normal boiling point range, the deviations between all 

the predicted values are not much large.

3.5.     Thermophysical and transport properties of petroleum fractions 

Thermophysical and transport properties (?, ? and Cp) were calculated at temperature 

range from 350 to 600 K (Figures 6 – 8). 

Figure 6 shows the plots of kinematic viscosity (?) of samples, over a wide temperature 

range compared with the pseudocomponents approach. The temperature effect upon ? was 

important. From Figure 6, it follows that the maximum variation of ? with temperature was given 

for ATR–W, while lower variation of ? was observed for ATR–Z with 24.9 of API gravity. Such 

variation in ? behavior may be ascribed to variation in the distribution of molar mass within the 

normal boiling point range for every fraction.

Figure 6. Estimation of viscosity. a) ATR–W; b) ATR–Y and c) ATR–Z. 

 

The thermal conductivity (?) of the samples was a function of density and of the nature 

of them (Figure 7). At higher API gravity and boiling points, petroleum fractions tend to be less 

paraffinic and have higher values of density than light fractions with low boiling point, thus the ? 

tends to decrease. In comparison with experimental data, the %AAD is estimated to be &amp;lt;2% 

(0.49% for ATR–W, 0.22% for ATR–Y and 1.08% for ATR–Z).

The results of the specific heat capacity (Cp), plotted in Figure 8, showed that the Cp 

increased with the raise in temperature. The variation in the rising trend of the Cp, among the 

mixtures, is due to the differences in chemical composition. Estimated values of Cp using the 

function distribution of normal boiling point were compared with experimental data obtained in 

our laboratory by DSC experiments. The %AADs for fitted Cp regarding to the experimental 

values were 1.88% for ATR–W, 9.36% for ATR–Y and 7.48% for ATR–Z.

4.        Conclusions 

A generalized distribution function (Equation 4) with two adjustable parameters was 

used for modeling cumulative distilled volume where the normal boiling point was the 

distribution variable. Therefore, modeling of continuous mixture was a versatile method to be 

applied to multicomponent systems such as petroleum fractions because it reduces the computer 

time considerably while it keeps the accuracy of the properties predictions. According to the 

absolute average deviations, results obtained for property predictions, by mean of continuous 

thermodynamic approach, showed better agreement, to the experimental data, than that attained 

by pseudocomponent approach.

3.3.     Considerações finais 

As propriedades físico–químicas (propriedades básicas, termodinâmicas e térmicas) 

foram estimadas através das correlações reportadas na literatura  e comparadas com os resultados 

obtidos das análises experimentais realizadas, no laboratório de pesquisa 

(LDPS/LOPCA/UNICAMP), visando seu acoplamento na modelagem matemática e a simulação 

do processo de destilação molecular reativa. 

A caracterização adequada das frações pesadas de petróleo é uma informação 

indispensável para o desenvolvimento de estudos teóricos e experimentais das técnicas de 

processamento destas frações. Baseado no conceito da termodinâmica contínua, o modelo da 

função de distribuição contínua generalizada, com dois parâmetros, proposto por Riazi (1989), foi 

utilizado para a estimativa de propriedades básicas e termodinâmicas das frações de petróleo.  

As propriedades críticas, de maneira geral, são utilizadas no cálculo de outras 

propriedades que, são necessárias para o processo de simulação da destilação molecular reativa. 

As correlações utilizadas para estimar o fator acêntrico não apresentam influência significativa na 

estimativa das outras propriedades termodinâmicas, dado que os desvios obtidos com os 

diferentes conjuntos de correlações foram menores do que 10%.  

As propriedades críticas de temperatura e pressão são sensíveis à temperatura de 

ebulição. Com o aumento da temperatura de ebulição aumenta a temperatura crítica, mas a 

pressão crítica e a densidade crítica diminuem. Esse resultado reflete em uma relação entre essa 

propriedade e a quantidade de componentes pesados que se encontram nas frações em estudo. 

Para o desenvolvimento da modelagem matemática da destilação molecular reativa é 

necessária a existência de uma relação entre a temperatura de operação e o calor específico. As 

equações avaliadas correlacionam o calor específico com a temperatura operacional (exemplo: 

300 – 600 K), apresentando um aumento com essa variável. A massa específica e densidade 

relativa das frações estudadas (ATR–W, ATR–Y e ATR–Z) não apresentam influência 

significativa na determinação do calor específico destas frações.

Capítulo 4 

Aplicações, considerações e fundamentos 

acerca da destilação molecular 
 

4.1.     Introdução 

O desenvolvimento da destilação molecular para a caracterização de frações pesadas de 

petróleo realizado pelo grupo de pesquisa do LDPS/FEQ/UNICAMP representa um considerável 

avanço na metodologia de análise dessas frações que, proporciona um melhor aproveitamento do 

óleo cru e ganhos na qualidade do produto final (Zuñiga–Liñan et al., 2011; Rocha et al., 2011; 

Zuñiga, 2009; Zuñiga et al., 2009; Zuñiga et al., 2009; Hernández, 2009; Rocha, 2009; Winter et 

al., 2009; Hernández et al., 2008; Lopes, 2008; Rocha, 2008; Rocha et al., 2008a; Rocha et al., 

2008b; Liñan et al., 2007; Lopes et al., 2007; Rocha et al., 2007; Winter, 2007; Winter et al., 

2007; Sbaite et al., 2006; Maciel–Filho et al., 2006;  Winter et al., 2006; Sbaite, 2005; Winter et 

al., 2004; Sbaite et al., 2003; Batistella et al., 2002; Batistella et al., 2000; Batistella e Wolf–

Maciel, 1998, 1996). 

A destilação molecular usada em vários processos da indústria química, farmacêutica, de 

alimentos e de petróleo é um caso particular de evaporação, a qual ocorre em pressões 

extremamente baixas, de modo que, o efeito do vapor gerado sobre o líquido praticamente não 

influencia a taxa de evaporação. Portanto, a superfície de evaporação e a superfície de 

condensação devem estar separadas entre si por uma distância de ordem de grandeza do livre 

percurso médio das moléculas evaporadas, ou seja, as moléculas evaporadas atingirão o 

condensador facilmente, uma vez que encontrarão um percurso relativamente desobstruído.  

Os tópicos aqui abordados englobam uma revisão dos seguintes conceitos quando 

considerada a configuração de um destilador molecular centrífugo:  

• Livre percurso médio ou caminho livre médio molecular, definido como a distância ou 

espaço entre duas colisões sucessivas das moléculas na fase vapor. Normalmente, na 

destilação molecular, o valor do livre percurso médio é da ordem de 0,02 a 0,05 m para 

pressões de processo de 0,13 Pa, ou seja, valores próximos à média da distância entre o 



102 

evaporador e o condensador, exigência para que a destilação ocorra eficientemente 

(Lutišan e Cvengroš, 1995; Holló et al., 1971). 

• O número de Knudsen, um número adimensional, definido como a razão entre o 

comprimento do caminho livre médio molecular e uma escala de comprimento 

fisicamente representativa (distancia entre a superfície do evaporador e o condensador). O 

número de Knudsen é muito útil para determinar se a formulação da mecânica estatística 

ou da mecânica do contínuo deve ser usada: Se o número de Knudsen é próximo ou maior 

que um, o caminho médio livre de uma molécula é comparável a escala de comprimento 

do problema e a consideração de continuidade da mecânica dos fluidos não é mais uma 

boa aproximação (Kawala e Dakiniewicz, 2002;  Barber e Emerson, 2002).  

• A taxa de evaporação efetiva ou velocidade de evaporação é representada pela equação de 

Langmuir–Knudsen (Langmuir, 1913; Lutišan et al., 2002; Badin e Cvengroš, 1992; 

Inuzuka et al., 1989; Inuzuka et al., 1986). Portanto, a velocidade de evaporação diminui 

tanto pelas colisões mútuas das moléculas evaporadas como pelas colisões das moléculas 

evaporadas com as moléculas do gás residual. No entanto, quando é incrementado o calor 

do sistema gera–se um aumento de temperatura, induzindo a um incremento na pressão de 

vapor, que resultará em um aumento da velocidade de evaporação. 

Contudo, a consideração de todos os aspectos anteriores na performance do processo da 

destilação molecular de frações de petróleo constitui a segunda fase deste estudo.

Molecular distillation High–Tech process: Knowledge–based understanding of 

mean free path and the Knudsen number applied to high–boiling–point 

petroleum fractions 

Abstract 

A theoretical study on the principles of molecular distillation (non–conventional High–

Tech process) such as: mean free path (MFP), effective evaporation rate (GE) and the influence of 

the Knudsen number (Kn) on the hydrodynamic development on an evaporating surface, was 

carried out under different conditions of evaporator temperature (423.15 K – 623.15 K) and 

pressure system (0.1 Pa – 1 Pa). In this study, the modeling and simulation were based on the 

kinetic theory and Langmuir–Knudsen equation for a set of twenty five (25) pseudocomponents 

in three high–boiling–point petroleum fractions (atmospheric petroleum residues W, Y and Z) 

with different API gravities. Numerical simulations showed that the main features of the 

principles of molecular distillation are linked with the distance between the evaporator and 

condenser surface (distillation gap) and pressure system. Thus, the MFP of evaporating 

molecules indicated that the anisotropic degree of the vapor phase, in a low pressure system with 

a relatively high evaporator temperature, is an essential condition in the molecular distillation 

process. Moreover, results of simulations have demonstrated that when it was considered a 

distance between the evaporator and condenser of 0.08 m and 0.05 m intermediate range values 

for the Kn (0.01 – 3.00) elucidated a flow pattern with the characteristics of molecular flow, and 

allowed one to estimate consistent values for the GE.  

 

Keywords: Molecular distillation; mean free path; Knudsen number; distillation gap; 

molecular flow; pressure system.

1.        Introduction 

In recent years, more efforts have been made to widen technology and develop the 

necessary procedures to reduce thermal hazards in the separation and purification of thermally 

unstable compounds and substances with low volatility, ensuring their quality for the required 

applications. In this context it is important to develop a chemical industry based on safe–efficient 

technology. Many materials such as oils, chemicals, medicines and natural foods, healthcare 

products, fatty acids, petroleum fractions etc, are viscous, high boiling and/or heat sensitive. To 

separate and/or purify them while maintaining their good quality, a non–conventional process is 

required at a low boiling temperature or even below it, with a short residence time, in order to 

minimize thermal degradation and allow for parallel reactions. In view of this, molecular 

distillation (MD) is a innovative separation technology that could be used in an attempt to secure 

separation, efficiency and quality aspects in a single process. 

MD is a high–tech thermal separation technique operating at pressures in the range from 

0.1 to 10 Pa. The potential of MD is due to the fact that it is appropriate for the separation and 

purification of thermally unstable materials without the hazard of thermal decomposition, as in 



105 

the case of many vitamins, essential oils, heat sensitive and high boiling point materials, since the 

process occurs under high vacuum with lower temperatures [1 – 8]. In the MD process, the vapor 

molecules must find a free path between the evaporator and the condenser, the pressure must be 

low and the width of the distillation gap must be comparable with the mean free path of the 

evaporating molecules. Under these conditions, theoretically, the evaporation rate should only be 

governed by the rate of escape of the molecules from the liquid surface, and therefore phase 

equilibrium does not exist [9]. 

1.1.     Research and development 

Experimental procedures and theoretical studies have been developed since the early 

twentieth century. These studies involved the design and construction of equipment on a pilot and 

laboratory scale, experimental studies with different feedstock (animal oils, vegetable oils, 

petroleum fraction etc.), the determination of the operating conditions, the development of 

mathematical models and the simulation of the molecular distillation process. Hence, the 

development of a separation process for thermally unstable materials was one of the most 

promising research and development areas in separation processes during the last decade, and this 

was reflected in the papers in specialized scientific journals and international conferences 

concerning non–conventional separation processes [10 – 48] (see Tables 1 – 2).

In this work, a theoretical study on the principles of molecular distillation such as: mean 

free path, effective evaporation rate and the influence of the Knudsen number on the 

hydrodynamic development on an evaporating surface, was carried out under three different 

conditions of evaporator temperature (423.15 K, 523.15 K and 623.15 K) and pressure system 

(0.1 Pa, 0.13 Pa and 1 Pa) when it was considered a centrifugal molecular distiller. 

In this study, the modeling and simulation were based on the kinetic theory and 

Langmuir–Knudsen equation for a set of twenty five (25) pseudocomponents in three 

atmospheric petroleum residues (high–boiling–point petroleum fractions) with different API 

gravities. 

2.        Molecular distillation in petroleum industry 

Petroleum includes the presence of heavy oil but there is a demand for lighter products 

in the oil industry, and therefore the refineries tend to convert part of their residues into light 

fractions. In the case of Brazilian oil, the difference in the quantity and quality of the residues 

from the vacuum column requires further development in order to raise their value and also to 

meet the demand. A detailed characterization is necessary and important before the optimized 

processing routes can be fixed. The term petroleum or crude oil includes petroleum–based 

substances comprising a complex blend of hydrocarbons, mainly paraffins (also called alkanes), 

olefins (alkenes), cycloparaffins (cycloalkanes), and aromatics; compounds containing nitrogen, 

sulfur and oxygen, such as the resins and asphaltenes and metallic species [49].  

The research petroleum groups, Separation Process Development Laboratory (LDPS) 

and Laboratory of Optimization and Advanced Control (LOPCA) of the State University of 

Campinas have developed studies, methodologies and procedures to characterize the petroleum 

fractions from the extension of the true boiling point curve to approximately 973.15 K. In this 

context, experiments were carried out in a molecular distiller (wiped film short path distillers) 

using heavy Brazilian oil fractions with different API gravities and under different operating 

conditions [2, 26, 29]. The cuts and residues obtained in the molecular distillation process were 

collected, quantified and characterized. These studies showed the potential for molecular 

distillation in characterizing petroleum fractions, since it was possible to extend the TBP curve 

and obtain gains in final product quality. 



109 

Therefore, such research emphasized the importance of the MD process in converting 

the heavier oil fractions into lighter products. Thus, MD of high–boiling–point petroleum 

fractions basically separates the molecules according to the differences in their vapor pressures, 

which generally decrease with increasing molar mass, carbon number and boiling point. 

2.1.     Process principles and operational advantages 

Distillation under high vacuum, where the condensing surface is very close to the 

surface of the evaporating liquid, enables one to operate in a different pressure range, such as 

under moderate vacuum (equilibrium phase), where the pressure range is above 133 Pa [50]; 

unobstructed path distillation, where there is free transfer of the molecules [50, 51]; and 

molecular distillation, where the distance between the evaporator and condenser surface is 

comparable with the mean free path of the evaporating molecules [41,50]. 

2.1.1.     Boiling temperature and pressure system 

The temperature at which a liquid boils depends on the pressure system. Therefore high–

vacuum distillation shows the benefit of evaporating and condensing the molecules at low 

pressure (0.1–10 Pa), and consequently in a low operating temperature range (evaporator 

temperature), obtaining a reduction in the distillation temperatures [44, 52, 53]. Furthermore, 

Catalogue UIC–GmbH [54] has introduced the concept of fine vacuum as related to the mean free 

path (MFP), that is, the pressure system (P) is in the range between 0.1 Pa and 100 Pa, such that 

the MFP of the molecules is a few centimeters, comparable to the distillation gap between the 

evaporator and condenser surfaces, and the flow on the evaporator surface is in the free molecular 

flow regime. 

2.1.2.     Residence time 

In MD the residence time of the material in the distillation gap at the evaporator 

temperature is to the order of seconds [8] i.e. typically less than one minute [54].  As a 

consequence, the residence time relies mainly on the viscosity of the material, the film thickness 

and the geometry of the evaporator. The most important advantage of MD is the minimal thermal 

load on the material to be distilled, and also the period of the thermal load has an influence on the 

degree of separation efficiency and thermal degradation [7, 45, 54]. In order to avoid any 



110 

negative effect on process quality, a short contact time of the liquid with the evaporator surface 

should be avoided [8]; and lengthy heating of the material to be distilled should be minimized. 

2.1.3.     Mean free path 

The MD process is characterized by the following features: short residence time in the 

distillation gap; low operating temperatures because of the reduced pressure, and a characteristic 

mechanism of mass transfer in the gap between the evaporating and condensing surfaces. 

In addition to the operating conditions (pressure system and temperature) being low, the 

condenser surface should be separated from the evaporator surface by a distance comparable with 

the mean free path of the evaporating molecules. Thus the mean free path (MFP) or average 

distance moved by the free molecules is the mean distance of the molecule from other moving 

particles, that is, the vapor molecules reach the condenser surface without intermolecular 

collisions. As a consequence, the MFP is a very important reference data in the design of a 

molecular distiller and in the MD process [51,53]. 

 According to the theory of kinetics, the MFP of a molecule can be estimated by 

considering the number density (number of molecules per unit volume) and the volume swept out 

by a molecule per unit time as it travels. Accordingly, the separation principle of molecular 

distillation is based on the difference in molecular MFP defined by the theory of the kinetics of 

ideal gases, as follows [53,55, 56]:

2.1.4.     Anisotropic condition and effective rate of evaporation 

The evaporation rate is an important factor in evaluating the efficiency of the MD 

process. Evaporation proceeds at a different rate and the vapor phase presents different physical 

properties as consequences of the fact that the gas behaves like a collection of independent 

particles. Thus, the appropriate vapor phase dynamic regime is determined by means of the 

Knudsen number (Kn), Equation (4), which expresses the ratio of the mean free path (MFP) of 

the vapor phase to a characteristic length (L), such as the boundary layer thickness, or a 

molecular distiller device dimension (the distance between the evaporator and the condenser 

surface) [41,57]. 

MFP
Kn

L

(4) 

In the case of a MD process, Kn &gt; 0.1 explains the fact that the vapor phase shows 

anisotropic behavior, which means that, at Kn &gt; 0.1 intermolecular collisions in the region of 

interest (space between the evaporator and the condenser surfaces) are much less frequent than 

molecular interactions [41, 58]. In the other cases, the Knudsen number (Kn) is less than 0.1, and 

thus the vapor has isotropic properties and behaves as continuous matter, such that the number of 

collisions between the molecules increases and the molecules can reach the condenser, but can 

also return to the evaporator surface and attain equilibrium; not a valid state in the MD process 

[41]. 

Nevertheless, with short distances between the evaporator and the condenser and a low 

number of collisions, evaporation of the molecules proceeds at the maximal rate described by the 

Langmuir–Knudsen equation (Equation 5) [42, 59, 60].

Where GT is the theoretical rate of evaporation, R is the universal gas constant (8314

), Pvap is the equilibrium vapor pressure at the absolute temperature Ts, M is the 

molar mass of the compound, and R is the universal gas constant. 

Therefore the MD process is a function of the molecular species and the surface 

temperature, that is, the molecular distillation process is a surface phenomenon [61]. 



112 

The effective rate of evaporation (GE) of each component is calculated using a modified 

Langmuir–Knudsen equation [62], where conditions in the vapor phase, above the thin 

evaporating liquid film, influence the effective mean free path of the molecules, as described by 

Equation (6) [41, 62]: 

E T
G G f=  (6) 

Where the coefficient f represents the fraction of vaporized molecules that reach the 

condenser and is expressed as follows [41]:

Kawala and Stephan [62] stated that the best value for n’ is equal to 5, and the degree of 

anisotropy k* of the vapor phase in the space between the evaporator and the condenser is given 

by: 

( )4log * 0.2 1.38 0.1k F F= + +  (8) 

Where F describes the curvature of the evaporation surface [41]:

Where de is the diameter of the evaporation surface curvature and L is the distance

takes into account the anisotropic effect of the vapor phase.

The Separation Process Development Laboratory (LDPS) and the Optimization, Project 

and Advanced Control Laboratory (LOPCA) of the Chemical Engineering School of State 

University of Campinas (UNICAMP), sponsored by the Petrobras Research 

Center(CENPES/Petrobras, Brazil) and Brazilian Study and Project Financing Institution 

(FINEP), projected and built molecular distiller units (pilot plants) and aimed at enhancing the 

performance of the heavy petroleum fractions and heavy petroleum crude oil. Molecular distillers 

show two principal designs: Falling film molecular distillers (FFMD) (with two (02) 



113 

configurations: wiped film short path distillers and thin falling evaporators); or centrifugal 

molecular distillers (CMD). The principal characteristics among them are described in Table 3.

3.1.     Chemical systems: High–boiling–point petroleum fractions 

In this study, Brazilian crude oils with different API gravities (16–25 °API), obtained 

from several sources, were distilled by conventional atmospheric distillation [63], resulting in 

three atmospheric distillation residues (ATR–W, ATR–Y and ATR–Z). The high–boiling–point 

petroleum fraction samples used as the feedstock were specifically selected in this study to cover 

a very broad range of properties. The BP curves were obtained in the Petrobras Research and 

Development Center (CENPES–Brazil) (Table 4).

Finally, considering just the liquid film on the wall of the evaporator surface, the values 

for MFP (Equations 1 – 3), the Kn (Equation 4) and GE (Equations 6 – 9) for the 25 

pseudocomponents from the high–boiling–point petroleum fractions under the different operating 

conditions (evaporator temperature ranging from 423.15 to 623.15 K and pressure ranging from 

0.1 to 1 Pa) were estimated. 

The computational tool used to develop the pseudoization computational approach and 

to estime the MFP, Kn and GE of the high–boiling–point petroleum fractions was built up in 

FORTRAN–90 language using Compaq Visual Fortran compiler (professional edition 6.6) [64]. 

4. Results and discussion 

The study on molecular distillation parameters was based on knowledge–based 

understanding of mean free path (MFP) and the Knudsen number (Kn) values applied to high– 

boiling–point petroleum fractions, as the important parameters in the description of the process 

taking place in a distillation gap with a width equal to 0.08 m (a centrifugal molecular distiller –  

pilot plant module) and 0.05 and 0.02 m (lab scale module). The operating conditions (evaporator 

temperature and pressure system) and dimension parameter (distance between evaporator and 

condenser) were analyzed. 

4.1 Effect of pressure system on the mean free path 

Computational data derived from Equations (1) – (3) are presented in Figures 1 – 3, 

showing the values for the MFP of the high–boiling–point petroleum fractions molecules under 

different operating conditions (evaporator temperature and pressure system) at a distance of 0.08 

m from the surface of evaporation to the condenser surface.

As can be seen in Figure 1, the MFP depends on the pressure system more than on the 

evaporator temperature, although both operating variables are important. An increase in 

evaporator temperature and a decrease in the pressure system (understood as the lowest value of 

the pressure system in the range studied) led to an increase in the MFP values for each 

pseudocomponent. Therefore, in order to take advantage of the MFP, the evaporator temperature 

must be kept at the highest trial level and the pressure system at the lowest level. Thus the 

greatest MFP appears to be near 623.15 K (between the range studied and the operational limit of 

the equipment) and the pressure equal to 0.1 Pa. 

With a higher pressure system, low MFP values were obtained, because the density of 

the molecules rises in the distillation gap, and the motion of the particles in the distillation gap 

causes isotropic behavior. Furthermore, MFP values equal to zero were reported, at the highest 

value of the pressure system (1 Pa), which means that the separation process does not occurs. 

Figure 1 shows the effect of the evaporator temperature when it is increased from 423.15 to 

623.15 K. Under these conditions, the evaporation rate of the molecule with the lowest vapor 

pressure was higher than the evaporation rate of the molecules with higher vapor pressures, and 

as a consequence, a greater evaporation rate caused a larger molecule density. 

The separation and split principle in molecular distillation is based on the pressure 

system enabling the molecules to evaporate from the evaporator to the condenser in the 

distillation gap (distance between the evaporator and condenser), and a small distance between 

these elements. Thus the concept of anisotropy in the distillation gap, introduced when it was 

analyzed with a lower pressure system (e.g. 0.1 Pa), refers to the motion of molecules implying 

heterogeneity in all directions. 

Figures 2 – 3 show the MFP values of the ATR–Y high–boiling–point petroleum 

fraction with a high asphaltene content, and of ATR–Z, with the highest API gravity of all the 

samples, representing the trials carried out with L=0.08 m, evaporator temperature ranges 

between 423.15 and 623.15 K and pressure systems ranging between 0.1 – 1 Pa. It can be seen 

that, in the simulation of the results, the difference between the MFP for the ATR–W molecules 

and that for the ATR–Z molecules, under the defined operational conditions, was to the order of 

60%, whereas in the simulations carried out with the ATR–Y high–boiling–point petroleum 

fraction,  the MFP values were very close to the specific range of the pseudocomponent, and thus 



122 

the MFP calculated for the ATR–Y molecules was also related to the asphaltene content, showing 

the highest isotropic behavior under a high pressure system (e.g. 1 Pa) when compared to 0.13 

and 0.1 Pa.   

As shown before (Figure 1), the effect of the pressure system was very relevant under 

the conditions analyzed, presenting an effect of about 33.33%, which means that, on average, the 

MFP increased 33.33% when the values for the pressure were decreased from 0.13 Pa to 0.1 Pa.  

Figure 3 shows the MFP of the ATR–Z high–boiling–point petroleum fraction 

molecules as a function of the pseudocomponent number, pressure system and evaporator 

temperature. Under the operational conditions explored, there was a decrease in the MFP values 

ranging from 0.040 to 0.012 m (when the pressure system was maintained at 0.1 Pa), from 0.029 

to 0.010 m (when the pressure system was maintained at 0.13 Pa) and from 0.005 to 0.001 (when 

the pressure system was maintained at 1 Pa) for 423.15 K. At 523.15 K, the MFP ranged from 

0.047 to 0.015 m (when the pressure system was maintained at 0.1 Pa), from 0.035 to 0.013 m 

(when the pressure system was maintained at 0.13 Pa) and from 0.005 to 0.002 (when the 

pressure system was maintained at 1 Pa). Finally, at 623.15 K, the MFP ranged from 0.056 to 

0.019 m (when the pressure system was maintained at 0.1 Pa), from 0.048 to 0.015 m (when the 

pressure system was maintained at 0.13 Pa) and from 0.006 to 0.002 (when the pressure system 

was maintained at 1 Pa). However, it appears that both the operating conditions of evaporator 

temperature and pressure system, and also the chemical composition of the samples (volatiles 

content and asphaltene content) present a great influence on the MFP values for the molecules of 

the high–boiling–point petroleum fractions.  

Since the MFP of the molecules of the light pseudocomponent (low volatility) decreased 

sharply as the distilling pressure increased, so more and more molecules failed to reach the 

condenser, and hence, there were less and less volatile components in the distillates. In the same 

way, when the distilling pressure increased to 1 Pa (low vacuum pressure), most of the heavier 

molecules with a larger molar mass as compared to the volatile components, failed to reach the 

condenser, resulting in isotropic behavior and/or continuous flow. 

The MFP values of the molecules calculated using the Equations (1) – (3) for ATR–W, 

ATR–Y and ATR–Z at 0.1 Pa and 0.13 Pa (in the whole evaporator temperature range) were in 

good agreement with the molecular distillation process, since they were quite comparable with 



123 

the distillation gap width (space between the evaporator and the condenser surface i. e. 0.08 m) 

and few intermolecular collisions would have been expected during the passage of the molecules 

from the evaporator surface to the condenser surface.  

Limiting the working pressure to a certain low level in order to be able to distill at the 

lowest possible temperature must be considered. This low level must be reached with a 

specifically dimensioned pressure system instead of an over–dimensioned system below this 

physical limit, or otherwise condensable molecules will not condense on the condenser surface, 

but will be carried over from the molecular distillation module to the succeeding vacuum system. 

In order to consider the distance between the evaporator and condenser surface as a design 

parameter, the role of the Knudsen number on the hydrodynamic development in the distillation 

gap must be examined. 

4.2.     The influence of the Knudsen number on the hydrodynamic in the 

distillation gap 

The Knudsen number (Kn) represents the relationship between the MFP and the 

characteristic dimension of the flow geometry (in the case studied, this corresponds to the 

distance between the evaporator and condenser surfaces). Figures 4 – 6 display the Kn parameter 

for each pseudocomponent, showing the effect of the pressure system (0.1&lt;P&lt;1 Pa) and 

evaporator temperature (423.15&lt;EVT&amp;lt;623.15 K) as the operating conditions, and the distance 

between the evaporator and the condenser (0.02&lt;L&amp;lt;0.08 m) as a mechanical design parameter, 

on the degree of rarefaction of the vapor phase. 

The validity of the continuum flow assumption and the rarefaction of the vapor phase 

are described by the Knudsen number (Kn), and the main effects of the two operational variables 

studied (EVT and P) and of the design parameter (distance between the evaporator and condenser 

surfaces, L) on the Kn are shown in Figures 4 – 6 for a set of 25 pseudocomponent numbers, and 

are therefore related to the boiling point of the pseudocomponent.

Case study 1: ATR–W and ATR–Z 

Figures 4 and 6 present the results of simulations for the Kn values with respect to the 

distribution of the components in the heavy petroleum fractions of ATR–W and ATR–Z. It was 

noted that the Kn values ranged between 0.01&amp;lt;Kn&amp;lt;3.00 under the ranges of evaporator 

temperature and pressure systems tested as the operating conditions. Hence, the effects of the two 

operating conditions must be analyzed as a function of the distance between the evaporator and 

the condenser surfaces. 

• Analyzing the distance between the evaporator and the condenser distance equaled 0.08, 

0.05 and 0.02 m, when the EVT was increased from 423.15 K to 623.15 K (at 0.1 Pa), on average, 

the Kn increased 49.61% for each pseudocomponent. 

In the data set of Kn values obtained at low vacuum pressure (that is, relatively high 

pressure system e.g. 1 Pa), Kn values equal to zero were obtained (not compromising the 

conclusions of the analyses) and isotropic behavior, since the Kn values did not change from 

pseudocomponent to pseudocomponent, maintaining an approximately constant value as shown 

in Figures 4g–4i and 6g–6i. 

• When the pressure system increased from 0.1 Pa to 1 Pa (at 423.15 K), on average the Kn 

decreased 92.34% for each pseudocomponent, analyzing the distance between the evaporator and 

the condenser between 0.08 m and 0.02 m. 

Considering the high evaporator temperature used (EVT=623.15 K) in the range studied 

(from 0.1 Pa to 1 Pa), on average, the Kn decreased 89.19% for each pseudocomponent. 

Case study 2: ATR–Y with high asphaltene content 

Figures 5a – 5c show that the anisotropic condition was obtained at 0.1 Pa with 

evaporator temperatures equal to 423.15 K, 523.15 K and 623.15 K and values for Kn ranging 

between 0.1&amp;lt;Kn&amp;lt;0.2 with L equal to 0.08 m; 0.15&amp;lt;Kn&amp;lt;0.32 with L equal to 0.05 m; and 

0.371&amp;lt;Kn&amp;lt;0.8 with L equal to 0.02 m.  

Furthermore, the effect of the two operational parameters was evaluated as follows: 

• When the EVT increased from 423.15 K to 623.15 K (at 0.1 Pa, Figures 5a – 5c), on 

average, the value for Kn increased 48.57% for every pseudocomponent, analyzing distances 



128 

between the evaporator and condenser equal to 0.08, 0.05 and 0.02 m. Considering a pressure 

system of 1 Pa in the EVT range studied from 423.15 K to 623.15 K (Figures 5d – 5f), on 

average, the value for Kn increased 24%. Nevertheless, it is evident that the effect of pressure is 

more significant that the effect of evaporator temperature, since in the EVT range studied from 

423.15 K to 623.15 K at 1 Pa (Figures 5g – 5i) profiles of Kn number showed an isotropic 

behavior because of it shows unchanged from pseudocomponent to pseudocomponent. 

• When the pressure system increased from 0.1 Pa to 1 Pa (at 423.15 K), on average, the 

value for Kn decreased 88% for every pseudocomponent, analyzing distances between the 

evaporator and condenser equal to 0.08, 0.05 and 0.02 m. Similarly, considering the high EVT 

used (623.15 K) in the range of pressure system studied, on average the Kn value decreased 

90.48% analyzing distances between the evaporator and condenser equal to 0.08, 0.05 and 0.02 

m.  

As a general overview, besides having a great impact on the design parameters of 

molecular stills, the parameter Kn is essential in the field of modeling and simulation of the 

molecular distillation process. The estimated values for Kn modeled the rarefaction effects of the 

vapor phase on the distillation gap, that it is understood as the beginning of the influence on the 

evaporating film flow, representing the slip–flow regime (0.01 &amp;lt;Kn &amp;lt;0.5) and anisotropic 

behavior (Kn &gt;0.5), where the Navier –Stokes equations can only be employed if one has 

tangential slip–velocity boundary conditions along the walls of the flow domain [58]. In this 

situation, the vapor molecules seldom collide with each other, and they can reach the condenser 

surface by way of distillation in an unobstructed path. This type of flow is known as free–

molecule flow (molecular flow regime) and it is characteristic of the molecular distillation 

process. However, comparing Figures 5a – 5i, it can be seen that the high–boiling–point 

petroleum fraction molecules of ATR–Y exhibit the greatest isotropic behavior for each 

pseudocomponent and for every operating condition studied, due to the higher asphaltene 

content.  

4.3. The effective evaporation rate 

Figures 7 – 9 depict the effective evaporation rate (GE) on the evaporator surface in a 

molecular distiller with distillation gap widths equal to 0.08 (corresponding to a pilot plant 

module) and to 0.05 and 0.02 m (corresponding to a lab scale module). The effective evaporation 



129 

rates were estimated in a temperature range from 423.15 to 623.15 K using a modification of the 

Langmuir – Knudsen expression (Equations 6 – 9) and taking the anisotropic effect into account. 

In the cases studied where multi–component mixtures were analyzed, the results showed that the 

more volatile components evaporated faster than the others, explaining the fact that their 

quantities in the feed diminished and the effective evaporation rates decreased as shown in 

Figures 7 – 9. 

The effective evaporation rate (GE) taking place at the evaporator surface was evaluated 

in a temperature range. In Figures 7a – 7i, the GE of the ATR–W high–boiling–point petroleum 

fraction is shown as a Gaussian distribution function following the distribution fraction of the 

pseudocomponents. For three different values of distillation gap width, the simulations showed 

that the GE decreased when that distance decreased. Nevertheless, when distance decreased to 

0.02, values were obtained for the effective evaporation rate, which had no physical meaning 

(negative values), which means that, theoretical studies could lead to over–dimensioned devices 

and the results will not be in good agreement with the process. 

Figures 8a – 8i show the GE for the ATR–Y high–boiling–point petroleum fractions for 

twenty five pseudocomponents. Considerable changes can be seen in the profiles when one 

considers the high asphaltene contents present in samples such ATR–Y. In general, under the 

operating conditions studied, a fast decrease in the GE was observed for the first 

pseudocomponents, with minimum variation being caused by the rest of the set of 

pseudocomponents.

133 

Figures 9a – 9i present the evaporation rate for the ATR–Z mixture plotted against the 

25 pseudocomponents under different operating conditions, comparing the parameter of the 

different distances between the evaporator and the condenser surfaces. Different distillation gap 

widths (distance between the evaporator and condenser equal to 0.08 m and 0.05 m), low 

asphaltene contents and low API gravities caused increases in the GE of the pseudocomponents 

with high molar mass, carbon number and boiling point, when compared with the effective 

evaporation rates of the ATR–W and ATR–Y, maintaining a continuous distribution of the set of 

pseudocomponents without any defined trend for increase or decrease. 

Figures 7 – 9 showed that the changes in the GE were greatly affected by the low value 

of the length, L=0.02 m, where a negative evaporation rate was obtained, showing that over–

dimensioning can generate results with no physical meaning from the point of view of the 

molecular distillation process. 

The results obtained, analyzing different operating conditions for the evaporator 

temperature and pressure system, will allow one to define the operating ranges to carry out 

modeling and simulation analyses, such as those analyzed in this work, where the changes in the 

evaporation rate are greatly affected by the initial operating temperature (evaporator wall 

temperature or evaporator temperature) and the distillation gap width, showing great changes in 

the inlet region of the evaporator–condenser devices. 

5.        Conclusions 

The examination of the principles of molecular distillation applied to high–boiling–point 

petroleum fractions, such as the mean free path, Knudsen number and effective evaporating rate 

at the evaporator surface, was based on kinetic theory (mean free path) and the Langmuir–

Knudsen equation (effective evaporation rate) for a set of pseudocomponents from three high–

boiling–point petroleum fractions. Three different conditions of evaporator temperature (423.15 

K, 523.15 K and 623.15 K) and pressure system (0.1 Pa, 0.13 Pa and 1 Pa) were analyzed. 

The mean free path of the molecules, as a significant parameter in the molecular 

distillation process, indicated heterogeneous values for each pseudocomponent of the high–

boiling–point petroleum fractions as a function of the operating conditions and dimension 

parameter (distillation gap width). Thus when the pressure system increased, the mean free path 



 

134 

of the molecules tended to be lower, when compared with the simulated data obtained at 0.13 Pa 

and 1 Pa. Therefore, the mean free path attains its lowest value for pseudocomponents with high 

molar mass, carbon number and boiling point, meaning that they cannot easily reach the 

condenser surface. 

A great influence of the gap width on the Knudsen number was observed, and 

consequently on the effective evaporation rate. In this sense, it is important to assess the 

dimension parameter of the distance between the evaporator and the condenser in both theoretical 

and experimental studies, since this can lead to an over–dimensioning of the gap width. 

Accordingly, low values for this variable (e.g. 0.02 m), could lead to results with no physical 

meaning (negative values) for the effective evaporation rate. 

One can also conclude that the Knudsen number can characterize the flow through the 

distillation gap from the ratio of the mean free path to the characteristic length of the distillation 

gap, where by means of the data obtained during the simulation, Knudsen numbers of above 0.01 

were estimated for the set of pseudocomponents from high–boiling–point petroleum fractions, 

establishing a characteristic fluid flow called Knudsen flow, where the continuum assumption 

begins to break down to achieve the anisotropic status with Knudsen number greater than 0.5. 

Analogous to the above parameters, the effective evaporation rate was strongly 

influenced by both operating conditions (evaporator temperature and pressure system) and the 

dimension parameter, distance between the evaporator and the condenser surfaces for the ATR–

W and ATR–Z high–boiling–point petroleum fractions. As the evaporator temperature increased 

and the pressure system decreased, so the Knudsen number increased and consequently, so did 

the anisotropic behavior. Therefore it was reported that by including these effects in the 

evaporation rate, the Knudsen number was affected in the same direction. 

In summary, the numerical simulation of the principles of molecular distillation allowed 

one to investigate the effect on evaporation rate for each pseudocomponent, where the rarefaction 

effects are important and must be included in the evaporation rate equation. The numerical data 

indicated that for outlooks work the flow could be modeled using the Navier–Stokes equations, 

but including the slip–velocity boundary conditions along the wall of evaporator.

4.3.     Considerações finais  

Nesse capítulo foi apresentada uma ampla revisão de estudos realizados ao redor do 

mundo e, especialmente, nos Laboratórios de Desenvolvimento de Processos de Separação 

(LDPS) e de Otimização, Projeto e Controle Avançado (LOPCA) da Faculdade de Engenharia 

Química da Unicamp, que em parceria com o órgão Financiador de Estudos e Projetos do 

Ministério da Ciência e Tecnologia (FINEP) e o Centro de Pesquisa CENPES/PETROBRAS 

desenvolveram uma metodologia – a destilação molecular – que permite caracterizar e separar 

cortes e resíduos pesados de petróleo a temperaturas superiores daquelas alcançadas pelos 

métodos padronizados ASTM D 2892 (2005) e ASTM D 5236 (2003).  

Considerações e aspectos teóricos, o livre percurso médio, o número de Knudsen e a 

taxa de evaporação efetiva, foram estudados. Com isso foi possível concluir que a eficiência da 

destilação molecular para separar frações pesadas de petróleo baseia–se em condições 

operacionais especiais de alto vácuo (entre 0,1 – 1 Pa) e temperatura do evaporador (entre 423,15 

– 623,15 K). Com a relação entre o livre percurso médio das moléculas presentes nas frações 

pesadas de petróleo (ATR–W, ATR–Y e ATR–Z), e a longitude característica do sistema (a 

distância entre a superfície do evaporador e a superfície do condensador), obteve–se um número 

adimensional denominado número de Knudsen. Com o número de Knudsen calculado foi descrito 

o comportamento da fase vapor sob a superfície do evaporador, para o qual é admissível 

estabelecer que para números de Knudsen maiores do que 0,5 descreveu–se um fluxo tal, que 

nestas condições, as colisões intermoleculares, na região de interesse, são menos frequentes que 

as colisões das moléculas com a superfície do condensador, satisfazendo uma das condições 

necessárias para atingir a separação no processo de destilação molecular (de tipo centrífugo). 

Outro aspecto estudado foi a taxa de evaporação sob o processo de destilação molecular, 

a qual é controlada pela taxa que as moléculas escapam da superfície livre do evaporador e 

atingem o condensador. Portanto, os resultados apresentaram que o condensador deve estar na 

imediata vizinhança da superfície do evaporador entorno de 0,05 a 0,08 m para os sistemas 

estudados (ATR–W, ATR–Y e ATR–Z).

Capítulo 5. 

Análise do perfil de velocidade e do regime 
de fluxo na destilação molecular centrífuga 
 

5.1.     Introdução 

A caracterização do escoamento do filme líquido, bem distribuído na parede interna da 

superfície de evaporador, é de essencial importância para a dinâmica do fluido no desempenho do 

processo da destilação molecular (processo não catalítico) e da destilação molecular reativa 

(processo catalítico). 

Alguns autores têm introduzido análises de características específicas da modelagem 

para misturas binárias, considerando evaporadores adiabáticos, sendo algumas dessas 

características a temperatura de alimentação, a pressão do sistema, as diferentes configurações de 

equipamentos e os efeitos da fase vapor. A modelagem resulta, então, num sistema de equações 

diferenciais parciais, que pode ser resolvido por métodos numéricos comumente descritos na 

literatura. 

Neste capítulo, é apresentado um estudo fluidodinâmico do escoamento do líquido 

gerado na destilação molecular. Para a simulação, foi considerado como caso de estudo o 

processamento de um resíduo atmosférico do petróleo “W” (ATR–W) 673,15 K+, em um 

destilador molecular centrífugo aquecido, onde a superfície do evaporador constitui uma 

superfície cônica. O resíduo atmosférico total foi dividido em 25 pseudo–componentes, os quais 

foram caracterizados utilizando dados de propriedades físico–químicas geradas pelo simulador 

desenvolvido por Tovar et al. (2011), e através de equações de predição, em função da 

temperatura media de ebulição e da densidade dos pseudo–componentes. 

A modelagem é fundamentada pelas equações de balanço de massa e de momento no 

filme líquido formado e escoando na superfície cônica do evaporador. A modelagem do processo 

descrita neste capítulo assume que: 

• O material apresenta um comportamento característico dos fluidos newtonianos. 



144 

• Considerou–se nas simulações deste trabalho um sistema monofásico, no qual o fluido 

simulado tem propriedades físicas correspondentes à média ponderada entre os 

componentes da mistura. 

• O filme líquido é considerado incompressível, distribuído uniformemente na superfície do 

evaporador garantindo uma boa transferência de massa.  

• A espessura do filme é considerada muito menor que o raio da superfície cônica. 

• Com a tentativa de obter a solução numérica para o fluxo em estado estacionário sobre a 

superfície do evaporador, a força gravitacional é desprezível em comparação com a força 

centrífuga. 

• A superfície cônica gira a velocidade angular ?, e o fluxo apresenta simetria axial em 

relação à coordenada ? , o que implica que a velocidade na direção –? (velocidade 

angular) é muito menor do que a velocidade na direção –? (velocidade tangencial) e a 

velocidade na direção –r (velocidade radial)). 

• Tendo em conta a finalidade deste trabalho e para a simplificação do processo de 

computação, a transferência de calor é ignorada.  

O desenvolvimento desta etapa do trabalho de Tese de Doutorado utiliza a técnica de 

CFD (do Inglês Computational fluid dynamics) para estudar, analisar e visualizar o 

comportamento fluidodinâmico do filme líquido sobre a superfície do evaporador. Este trabalho 

tem como objetivo (i) investigar o efeito das diferentes condições de operação (vazão de 

alimentação e velocidade do rotor), com temperatura de evaporação constante (423,15 K), no 

perfil de velocidade do filme fino de líquido de um resíduo atmosférico de petróleo escoando 

sobre a superfície do evaporador de um destilador molecular centrífugo, e (ii) estudar as 

componentes da velocidade nas direções –r, –? e –?, considerando um estado bidimensional 

estacionário (no padrão de fluxo laminar), onde o vetor velocidade, perpendicular à superfície 

cônica (em direção –?), é ignorado. Apenas vetores na direção radial (direção –r) e direção 

tangencial (direção –?) foram considerados. 

As equações do modelo foram resolvidas no software comercial ANSYS CFX (de Ansys 

Inc., EUROPE) baseadas nas equações de continuidade de Navier–Stokes e nas equações de 

modelo de turbulência (k–? e Shear Stress Transport k–?’).

CFD–Based analysis of the flow regime in the centrifugal molecular 

distillation of an atmospheric residue of petroleum 

Abstract 

The characterization of the flow in the evaporating liquid film, well distributed on the 

inner wall of the evaporator surface, is of paramount importance to the fluid dynamics within 

the molecular distillation process performance. This work aims (i) to investigate the effect of the 

different operating conditions (feed flow rate and rotor speed) at constant evaporator 

temperature (423.15 K) on the velocity profile in the thin liquid film of a residue from 

atmospheric distillation of petroleum on the evaporator surface of a centrifugal molecular 

distiller; and (ii) to study the components of velocity in r, ? and ?–directions considering a two–

dimensional steady state model (in laminar flow pattern), where the perpendicular velocity 

vector of the conical surface (in? –direction) was  ignored, only tangential (?–direction) and 

radial (r–direction) vectors were considered and the effect of gravity on flow was negligible in 

comparison with the centrifugal force. 

The analyses were carried out using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, 

making use of the commercial software ANSYS CFX 11.0 (of Ansys Inc., EUROPE) based on 

the finite volume method.  



147 

A laminar flow model and two turbulence flow models (the standard k–? and the SST k–

?’ turbulence models) were considered. A comprehensive model based on the Navier–Stokes 

and continuity equations represented the computational model.  

The simulations showed an overall good agreement with the molecular distillation 

process, based on the fact that the feed flow rate at the inlet of the device has an important effect 

on the velocity distribution. Results suggest that the k–? and SST k–?’ turbulence models are 

suitable for simulating evaporating liquid film in centrifugal molecular distiller. Nevertheless, 

small differences between the results obtained with turbulence and laminar models were found. 

Hence, laminar flow model is enough for modeling centrifugal molecular distillation process. 

About velocity components, the results from this computational study showed the 

radial velocity component is higher than the tangential velocity component in respect to the 

conical surface. The usefulness of the above information obtained from the CFD simulation and 

analysis will be elucidated for modeling of a centrifugal molecular distillation process. 

Keywords: Molecular distillation, flow regime, computational fluid dynamics, velocity 

components and operating variables.

1.        Introduction 

Molecular distillation is acknowledged as a continuous separation process operating 

under high vacuum conditions (Lin and Yoo, 2009; Cvengroš et al., 2000). It is a thermal 

purification and separation process for thermally unstable materials, liquids with low vapor 

pressure, high boiling points and elevated molar masses from the fields of chemical, 

pharmaceutical, petrochemical and food industries. This process is characterized by short 

exposure of the distilled liquid to elevated temperatures (short residence time) and low 

evaporation temperatures to cause a minimum thermal hazard to the distilled product (Tovar et 

al., 2010; Sales–Cruz and Gani, 2006; Xubin et al., 2005; Micov et al., 1997).  

Numerous theoretical and numerical investigations have been carried out to understand 

the molecular distillation characteristics, the effect of various parameters on their performance 

and process modeling. Several authors have published works concerning the modeling of the 

molecular distillation process for binary and multicomponent mixtures. Greenberg (1972), Rees 

(1980), and Inuzuka et al. (1986) developed a mathematical model of the centrifugal molecular 

distillation process based on a fully developed profile (but for the first two works, negligible 

normal and tangential velocity components were considered). In their works the authors analyzed 

thermal gradients, liquid film thickness and rates of evaporation. 

Bhandarkar and Ferron (1988) studied the liquid–phase transfer in high–vacuum 

distillation on a rotating evaporator surface using the mass, momentum and energy balance 

equations. Micov et al. (1997) and Xubin et al. (2005) presented a mathematical formulation 

which considers the liquid film flowing over the evaporator surface and vapor phase under the 

assumption that the distilled liquid consists of two components. The first authors presented a 

model described by the Boltzmann equation for mass transfer in the vapor phase, the Navier–

Stokes equations for liquid film, a diffusion equation and a thermal balance equation. They 

showed results on different operating conditions (laminar isothermal and non–isothermal films) 

where the difference in those regimes was clearly shown in the volume and composition of the 



149 

residual liquid. The second authors considered different operating conditions (i.e. feed flow rate, 

evaporation temperature, and inert gas pressure) in order to obtain the profile of temperatures, the 

concentration of the film and the profiles of density. 

On the other hand, some authors have previously studied specific issues. For instance, 

Kawala and Stephan (1989) and, Kawala and Dakiniewicz, (2002) studied the process in which 

the falling film was considered in an adiabatic regime. Batistella and Maciel (1996) compared the 

performance of two equipment configurations (centrifugal and falling film) for binary mixtures 

based on the model proposed by Kawala and Stephan (1989).  Cvengroš et al. (2000) analyzed 

the effect of the inlet feedstock temperature on the evaporation rate considering the mixture as a 

single component.  

Additionally, some works related to the hydrodynamic behavior on the evaporator 

surface have been developed recently. Non–conventional techniques or methods have been fully 

established in the literature to evaluate the flow behavior and/or quality of thin film on an 

evaporator surface in the centrifugal and falling film molecular distillers. Analyses include flow 

visualization and flow partners (laminar or turbulent) that take place in the thin liquid film.  

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has become a very powerful tool in the research 

and development of industry processes which attempt to understand, analyze and predict behavior 

under specific operating conditions. Several new works related to the hydrodynamic behavior on 

the evaporator surface have been developed recently.  Xiang and Xu (2005) analyzed the velocity 

distribution of evaporating liquid film in a wiped molecular distiller considering two turbulent 

models.  

Centrifugal molecular distillation process is one kind of molecular distillation, and its 

modification from others is in the centrifugal force by which the evaporating liquid film is 

formed. It has a fast rotating spinning cone, to create a fast spreading and moving film of liquid. 

When the rotating cone is heated, distillation takes place.  

The aim of this study was to evaluate different operating conditions (feed flow rate (Q) 

and rotor speed (RS)), at a constant evaporator temperature (423.15 K), on the flow pattern in thin 

liquid film for specific feedstock (a residue from atmospheric distillation of petroleum, ATR–W) 

when considered two turbulence flow models (the standard k–? and SST k–?’ turbulence models) 

on the evaporator surface of a centrifugal molecular distiller (CMD).  



150 

In the same system, but now considering different operating conditions for evaporator 

temperature (EVT), was investigate the components of velocity in r, ?, and ?–directions (?r, ?? 

and ??, respectively) on the velocity profile on the thin liquid film over the evaporator surface 

considering a laminar flow model. 

The effect of operating conditions on the velocity profile, including flow visualization 

and flow partners (laminar or turbulent), was investigated by the Computational Fluid Dynamics 

(CFD) using the commercial software package, ANSYS CFX (of Ansys inc., EUROPE). The 

study is projected to (i) serve as a powerful tool for characterizing the flow formed in the thin 

film during molecular distillation processes and, (ii) provide information about the velocity 

profile based on the choice of operating conditions to be used in the mathematical modeling of 

the centrifugal molecular distillation process. Therefore, this work will serve as a novel method 

to study the flow and hydrodynamic behavior of liquid film on an evaporator surface in a 

centrifugal molecular distiller by means of CFD simulation.

The material is pumped from the customer supplied supply/feed tank by a variable speed 

feed pump (12) into the degasser. A feed pump (6) moves the degassed material to the center of 

the heart of a centrifugal molecular distiller, the evaporator (Figure 1b), described as a conical 

spinning surface (11) housed in a high vacuum chamber (10). The centrifugal force spreads the 

material rapidly over the hot surface (9), where distillation takes place and the material expands 

out on the radius of the disc. Distillate condenses upon the inner surface of the cooled condenser 

dome (10), and by gravity, passes through the bottom of the base plate to the distillate collector 

vessel (6–7), while the unevaporated molecules, which did not reach the condenser surface, slides 

into a gutter surrounding the rotor and then carried to a collector vessel (6 –7). Therefore, the 

objective of separation has been reached. 

2.        Physical modeling, governing equations and computational method 

Numerical simulations were performed with a commercially available CFD software 

ANSYS CFX 11.0 (of Ansys inc., EUROPE). A sketch of the coordinate system is depicted in 

Figure 2, and it uses spherical polar coordinates (r, ?, ?) with corresponding velocity components 

(?r, ??, ??). The origin is at the apex of the cone, the axis is along ?=0.

 In this study some assumptions are made:  

• As a simple constitutive equation, material is assumed to be a Newtonian fluid. 

• The distilled liquid is considered like a single component and the physicochemical 

properties are not dependent on the evaporator temperature. 

• The liquid film (fluid domain for CFD study) is considered to be incompressible, 

uniformly distributed on the evaporator wall guarantying an excellent mass transfer, and 

the film thickness is considered much smaller than the radius of the conical surface.  

• As attempt to obtain numerical solution for the steady–state flow over the evaporator 

surface, the gravitational force is negligible in comparison with the centrifugal force onto 

the heated evaporator wall. 

• The conical surface rotates at a fixed angular velocity ?; and the flow shows axial 

symmetry with respect to the coordinate? , it implies that the velocity in the ?–direction is 

much smaller than both, the velocity in ?–direction and the velocity in the r–direction.  

• Taking into account the purpose of this work and for simplifying the computing process, 

heat transfer is ignored. 

2.1.     Computational fluid approach: Numerical framework 

The present model is based on the procedure suggested by Hinze and Milborn (1950), 

Bruin (1969), Rees (1980), Bhandarkar and Ferron (1988); and Batistella and Maciel (1996) 

involving a thin liquid film on a surface of a spinning truncated cone. The Navier–Stokes

2.2.     Turbulence models 

2.2.1.     Standard k–? turbulence model 

A transport equation for the fluctuating vorticity, and thus the dissipation rate, can be 

derived from the Navier Stokes equations. It includes two extra transport equations to represent 

the turbulent properties of the flow. The first transported variable is turbulent kinetic energy, k, 

which determines the energy in the turbulence (Equation 8). The second transported variable is 

the turbulent dissipation, ? (Equation 9), which determines the scale of the turbulence (Rapley et 

al., 2008;  El-Behery and Hamed, 2009; Singhal and Spalding, 1981). 

The equations involved in the standard k–? model for turbulence energy and turbulence 

dissipation rate are given as (El-Behery and Hamed, 2009; Rapley et al., 2008; Yakhot et al.,

2.2.2.     Shear stress transport k–?’ model 

In the CFD software ANSYS CFX 11.0 (of Ansys inc., EUROPE), the shear stress 

transport k–?’ model (SST k–?’) combines advantages of both the standard k–? model and the k–

?’ model. It automatically switches to the k–?’ model in the near region and the standard k–? 

model when away from the walls. The SST k–?’ model has a similar form to the standard k–

2.3.     CFD modeling: Pre–processing 

The 3–D CFD analysis presented in this study was developed using the ANSYS CFX 

11.0 (of Ansys Inc., EUROPE). The ANSYS CFX package was used to model the fluid phase 

(liquid thin film) through a system of governing equations in the steady state for the fluid flow on 

the evaporator surface of the centrifugal molecular distiller. 

2.3.1.     Geometry details and modeling of computational flow domain 



155 

Flow predictions were carried out to study the performance of thin liquid film on an 

evaporator surface. Figures 3a – 3c shows the details of the geometry of the evaporator surface 

used in the flow investigation. The studied geometry involves a cone with a constant vertex angle 

rotating with a constant rotational velocity.

The mesh (Figure 3c) was obtained for the geometry of the thin liquid film on the 

evaporator surface and was used in the case simulations as described in Figure 4. A mesh 

composed of 2,226,399 (428,607 nodes) tetrahedral, prismatic and pyramidal elements was used 

(Figure 3c). The grid was tested with different grid densities in order to verify that the solution 

was grid–independent. Therefore, the prismatic elements are located adjacent to the walls and 

ensure that the boundary layer is properly resolved.

Simulations were considered converged when the normalized root mean square (RMS) 

residuals for the velocities were below 1x10–4. The residuals for different equations are given as

2.3.2.     Flow domain 

Conventional atmospheric distillation (ASTM D 2892, 2005) from Brazilian crude oil 

from API gravity around 18 °API provided an atmospheric distillation residue (ATR–W). It was 

supplied by the Petrobras Research and Development Center (CENPES–Brazil). The atmospheric 

residue was used as the operating fluid. In order to characterize fluid properties (Table 1), the 

ATR–W was modeled in previous physicochemical study (Tovar et al., 2011).

3.        Results and discussion 

3.1.     Modeling laminar flow of thin liquid film on evaporator surface: 

Overall effects of operating conditions 

Simulated velocity profile plots of the flow (the thin liquid film of the ATR–W) 

produced by the molecular distillation process using the laminar flow pattern are presented in 

Figures 5a – 5d and 6a – 6d. Different operating conditions of the Q (at 0.288, 1.5, 3.0 and 39.5  

kg.h-1) and the RS (at 580 and 1450 rpm) at 423.15 K as the EVT were analyzed. 

(a) (b) 



158 

In both conditions of the RS (580 and 1450 rpm), results showed that a high flow region 

was formed in the r–direction along the evaporator surface through the spinning cone from 

r=0.000 m to r=0.213 m. When outward flow was analyzed, the maximum upward velocity 

magnitude was about 28.700 m·s-1 (at 0.288, 1.5 and 3.0 kg·h-1 and 1450 rpm); 17.640 m·s-1 (at 

39.5 kg·h-1 and 1450 rpm); 9.500 m·s-1 (at 0.288, 1.5 and 3.0 kg·h-1 and 580 rpm); 12.038 m·s-1 (at 

39.5 kg·h-1 and 580 rpm) near r=0.213 m. Hence, the thin liquid film on the evaporator surface 

spreads outside since the vector of velocity distribution is moving in the r–direction, describing 

symmetrical velocity distributions. 

Nevertheless, the plots generally show similar flow patterns, with a strong primary 

circulation for creating a strong vortex flow in the center of the spinning cone. However, some 

slight differences can be noticed when Q is increased, keeping RS constant (at 580 rpm or 1450 

rpm). As a result, the circulation of the vortex flow predicted by this study is situated slightly 

lower in the inlet section. Results reported that a vortex, below the inlet section, was entrapped 

between the inner cone (the evaporator surface) and the flow domain (the thin liquid film). As the 

rate of Q is increased, the size of the vortex seems to increase, with its center traveling away from 

the inlet (in the positive axial direction) to the r–direction. Accordingly, similar results have been 

obtained by Rapley et al. (2008) and Pereira and Sousa (1999) on a rotating cone geometry where 

streamlines show a vortex to be located near the inlet pipe. 

Nonetheless, Figures 5 – 6 shows that the predicted flow patterns are generally in good 

agreement, quantitatively and qualitatively, with the studied process. However, simulated data of 

the liquid flow on the evaporator surface allowed the identification of a limiting situation related 

to Q as an operating variable in which, at high values of Q might affect the mass transfer in the 

molecular distillation process. 

However, the operating condition in which Q equals 39.5 kg·h-1, requires special 

attention. The simulation results showed a profile velocity magnitude of about 12.038 m·s-1 at 

580 rpm and 17.640 m·s-1 at 1450 rpm near the outlet section. Therefore, a swirling region below 

the inlet section was observed and the flow assumptions made in the laminar model suggest 

analyses about turbulence approach in this region.

3.2.     Modeling turbulent flow of thin liquid film on evaporator surface: 

Overall effects of operating condition 

The effect of the turbulence model was investigated using an isotropic eddy viscosity 

model (the standard k–? turbulence model) and the shear–stress transport model k–?’ model (SST 

k–?’ model). Convergence was based on the behavior of the transport equation residuals. The 

iterative convergence history showed that both models had good convergence. However, a large 

amount of numerical noise in the behavior of the turbulent kinetic energy, with the k–? turbulence 

model approach, was observed. It could be damped by choosing the SST k–?’ turbulence model 

which increases the computational effort and the solver robustness. 

The stream lines plots using the standard k–? and the SST k–?’ models (Figures 7 – 8) 

are compared with those of the reference case in Figures 5 – 6, corresponding to laminar flow 

pattern. In a general aspect, the two turbulence models give flow patterns that are very alike. 

Some small differences were noticed however in the inlet and in the outlet section of the system. 

At the center of the spinning cone, when simulations were carried out using SST k–?’ model, 

there appeared to be a slight reverse flow in regards to the flow predicted by the laminar flow 

pattern, which was not observed with the standard k–? model. 

In the internal distance (r=0.030 m), the velocity magnitude, predicted by the standard 

k–? model, were slightly higher than the value predicted by the SST k–?’ model. This small 

discrepancy could be due to the fact that the velocity distribution in this region is better modeled 

by the SST k–?’ model for modeling swirling flows. Thus, the SST k–?’ model showed more 

sensitivity to this upstream boundary condition than the standard k–? model. 

Nevertheless, both CFD simulations predicted the same trend for velocity distribution as 

the thin liquid film flows away from the evaporator surface, when compared with simulations 

carried out with laminar flow pattern approach. Smaller differences between the simulation 

results can be found in the outlet section of the evaporator surface, especially in the region near to 

r=0.213 m leading edge. The simulation with the SST k–?’ turbulence model captures the 

velocity distribution better, while the simulation with the standard k–? turbulence model showed 

some discrepancies at the region near r=0.030 m.

3.2.1.     Turbulence kinetic energy 

Figures 9 – 10 shows the contour graph of the turbulence kinetic energy field in the r?? 

plane and at the operating conditions of Q (at 0.288, 1.5, 3.0 and 39.5 kg·h-1) and RS (at 580 and 

1450 rpm) at 423.15 K for the standard k–? and SST k–?’ turbulence models, respectively. 

Qualitatively, a number of features of the flow in the inlet section were correctly 

predicted by these models. Figures 9 – 10 shows the radial profile of the turbulent kinetic energy 

for the thin film on the evaporator surface. Based on the simulated data, it was observed that the 

standard k–? model is not able to predict the turbulent kinetic energy anywhere nears the inlet 

region, and the SST k–?’ model showed comparatively better agreements with the process 

objective. These deviations could be explained on the basis that the standard k–? model is based 

on isotropic assumptions where the turbulent kinetic energy formulation is constructed with a 

limitation that all the normal components of stresses are equal to each other as described in Aubin 

et al. (2004). In this way, due to the inaccuracy of the isotropic turbulence model (the standard k–

? model) in predicting anisotropic turbulent flows, the SST k–?’ model was able to simulate 

some of the turbulence anisotropy near from evaporator wall at the region below inlet section.  

On the other hand, using the standard k–? model, results concerning to the production of 

turbulent kinetic energy, due to flow velocity distribution, reported that values of Q less than 3.0 

kg.h–1 may, in fact, be enough to form a uniform thin film on the evaporator surface. Hence, 

taking into account the standard k–? model, the turbulence kinetic energy values at feed flow 

rates &amp;lt;3.0 kg·h-1 (Figures 9a – 9d) were lower than 0.147 m2·s-2 (at 580 rpm) and 2.873x10-3 

m2·s-2 (at 1450 rpm) in comparison with values obtained with the Q operating condition at 39.5 

kg·h-1 reaching values of 9.897 m2·s-2 at both, 580 rpm and 1450 rpm. 

However, using the SST k–?’ approach (Figures 10a – 10d), it was noted that the system 

showed higher effectiveness than performance of process developed with the standard k–? model, 

since the turbulent kinetic energy production was approximately 0.000 m2·s-2.

3.3.     Study of components of velocity in evaporating liquid film of a 

petroleum fraction on the evaporator surface  

The 3–D simulation by means of ANSYS CFX software package provided the velocity 

profile developed in the evaporating liquid film. Using the contour graph, the velocity profiles 

along the thin film are given in Figures 11 – 13 at different operating conditions. In this section, 

results will be presented in two sub–sections, describing the quantitative and qualitative influence 

of the operating variables (EVT, Q and RS).  

3.3.1.     Effect of evaporator temperature on velocity distribution 

To illustrate the influence of EVT on velocity distribution, simulations were carried out 

as shown in Figure 11a–c – 13a–c. In the simulations, different EVT values were studied at fixed 

Q (equals 0.288 kg.h-1) and RS (equals 1450 rpm) values. For all these runs, maximum 

magnitudes of velocity, at 423.15, 523.15 and 623.15 K, were kept around 28.747, 24.306 and 

26.981 m.s-1, respectively (considering a radial distance equals 0.213 m). In the same way, the 

maximum magnitudes of radial velocity components, at 423.15, 523.15 and 623.15 K, were 

28.544, 24.305 and 26.980 m·s-1 respectively and, the magnitudes of the tangential velocity 

component at 423.15, 523.15 and 623.15 K, were 0.086, 0.192 and 0.207 m·s-1 respectively 

(considering a radial distance equals 0.213 m). 

In general, it can be observed that an increase in the EVT causes an increase in the 

vorticity moment below the inlet section. Due to this, below the inlet section, the tangential 

velocity component on the conical evaporator surface attains negative values; and is known as the 

transition path between the inlet flow through the feed pipe and the entrance region of the flow 

on the evaporator surface. Therefore, the centrifugal force generated by high rotational velocity 

of the rotor creates a tangential gradient across the inlet section that results in the generation of a 

vortice flow. Hence, the existence of the vortice flow leads to flow distortion in the cross–

sectional plane of the conical surface. 

However, based on the results obtained by analyzing the effect of EVT on the velocity 

profile, two important facts were elucidated: (i) the tangential velocity component can be 

considered negligible when compared with the radial component; and (ii) the velocity profile of 

flow in the thin film varies significantly because of the EVT and RS effect.

Nevertheless, it is known that EVT plays an important role in the molecular distillation 

process from the viewpoint of both the mass ratio of the distillate and residue streams and the 

evaporation rate. However, taking into account the purpose of this work, heat transfer in the thin 

film was still ignored.  

3.3.2.     Effect of feed flow rate and rotor speed on velocity distribution 

Analyses related to the Q and RS effects on the velocity visualization in r and ?–

directions components inner the thin liquid film over the evaporator surface were carried out 

using CFD and they are presented in Figures 14 – 19. A reasonable agreement can be observed 

between principles of the CMD process and simulated data, except below the inlet section when 

it is considered a high value of Q (e.g. 39.5 kg·h-1). Figures 14a–c – 16a–c present the 

dependence of the velocity profile with Q and RS. It can be observed that the effect of RS is 

higher at elevated Q values. Therefore, in the CFD approach, different Q values were studied at 

fixed EVT (equals 423.15) and RS (equal 580 and 1450 rpm) values. For all these runs, keeping 

RS at 580 rpm (Figures 14 – 16), maximum magnitudes of velocity, around 9.460, 9.813 and 

12.038 m·s-1, were reached at 0.288 kg·h-1 K, 1.5 kg·h-1 and 39.5 kg·h-1 respectively (considering 

a radial distance equals 0.213 m). In the same way, the maximum magnitudes of radial velocity 

component, at 0.288 kg·h-1, 1.5 kg·h-1 and 39.5 kg·h-1, were 9.456, 9.813 and 11.890 m·s-1 

respectively (considering a radial distance equals 0.213 m). In addition, the magnitudes of the 

tangential velocity component at 0.288 kg·h-1, 1.5 kg·h-1 and 39.5 kg·h-1, were 0.265, 0.096 and 

1.88 m·s-1 respectively (considering a radial distance equals 0.213 m). 

Comparing the results obtained in which EVT and RS were kept constant at 423.15 K 

and 580 rpm, Figures 17a–c – 19a–c show that the CFD modeling approach predicts velocity 

profiles that are generally in good agreement, quantitatively and qualitatively, with the process, 

once it was analyzed the EVT and RS at 423.15 K and 1450 rpm, respectively. Analyzing the 

maximum magnitudes of velocity at 0.288 kg·h-1, 1.5 kg·h-1 and 39.5 kg·h-1, they were predicted 

around 28.544, 28.785 and 17.640 m·s-1, respectively (considering a radial distance equals 0.213 

m). In the same way, the maximum magnitudes of radial velocity components, at 0.288 kg·h-1, 

1.5 kg·h-1 and 39.5 kg·h-1, were 23.714, 23.785 and 16.934 m·s-1, respectively (considering a 

radial distance equals 0.213 m); and the tangential velocity components at  0.288 kg·h-1, 1.5 kg·h-

1 and 39.5 kg·h-1, were 0.026, 0.023 and 0.293 m·s-1, respectively.

In Figures 14 – 16 (at 580 rpm) and in Figures 17 – 19 (at 1450 rpm), it can be observed 

that the increasing of the Q values caused an increase in the vorticity moment below the inlet, as 

was described when it was considered the EVT effect. From this, the tangential velocity 

component was negative for at least the first fourth part of the conical surface, whereas after the 

transition path, the tangential velocity component was positive along the follow radial distance.  

The effect of Q and RS on visualization of the components of velocity in ?–direction is 

market by the positive values for the tangential velocity component which imply that the flow it 

is rotating slightly faster or at the same rotational speed than the cone, but if it is negative, the 

flow is rotating slower than the cone, thus it will be retarding the flow, which will create greater 

vortices about the cone surface inlet than the flow domain. Finally, Q and RS will become 

important variables in the centrifugal molecular process because at high values of this operating 

conditions, the residence time of the molecules on the evaporator surface will be shorter, thus, the 

mass transfer is affected and the evaporation rate might not be high enough to produce a 

considerable amount of the desired stream (distillate or residue). 

4.        Conclusions 

CFD simulations of the flow generated on an evaporator surface by centrifugal 

molecular distillation have been carried out. The investigations have focused on the analyses of 

pattern flow, both laminar and turbulent, and on velocity distribution. Overall, the results, using 

both approaches, are in very good agreement with the molecular distillation process.  

The turbulence pattern flow simulations expressed that these two turbulent models, the 

standard k–? and SST k–?’, are suitable for simulating evaporating liquid film in a molecular 

centrifugal distiller. Nevertheless, the CFD simulations conducted for this work with the 

turbulence models did not reflect significant changes on the velocity distribution in the upward 

flow on the evaporator surface regarding to laminar flow. Thus, the velocity distribution of the 

thin film on the evaporator surface can be modeled by the laminar pattern flow in order to 

simplify the computing process.  

Based on the results obtained in the theoretical work through CFD simulation, Q (feed 

flow rate) and RS (rotor speed) presented important effects on visualization of the velocity 

profile. The liquid flow pattern on the evaporator surface indicated the laminar flow of thin film 

is governed by the radial velocity component and, consequently, the tangential velocity 



 

172 

component may be negligible. The liquid flow on the evaporator surface allowed the 

identification of a limiting situation related to feed flow rate (Q) as an operating variable, in 

which, at high values of Q might affect the mass transfer in the molecular distillation process. 

The results presented in this work are useful for broadening the application of CFD as a 

tool for simulating the flow of complex mixtures, such as a petroleum atmospheric residue, on an 

evaporator surface in centrifugal molecular distillers. 

The CFD simulations were validated for this study corresponding to a framework 

analysis of a centrifugal molecular distillation. Though the CFD results in the present study have 

not been experimentally validated, these results provided useful information on the flow 

dynamics (the flow regime and components of velocity distribution in thin liquid film) of the thin 

liquid film (of the ATR–W) along the evaporator surface. Therefore, the CFD analyses will be 

used as an intermediate step towards the modeling flow during the process.

5.3.     Considerações finais 

Neste trabalho, a fluidodinâmica computacional, CFD (do inglês Computational Fluid 

Dynamics), mostrou–se como uma abrangente ferramenta computacional para a simulação de 

escoamento, que envolve o filme líquido sob a superfície do evaporador. A versatilidade na 

obtenção de distribuições das velocidades ou das características do escoamento, em qualquer 

região da superfície do evaporador, tornou amplo o emprego dessa técnica. 

Nesse capítulo, foi apresentado o estudo dos efeitos das condições operacionais: 

temperatura do evaporador, vazão de alimentação e velocidade do rotor, sob o comportamento 

fluidodinâmico. As equações do fluxo líquido foram resolvidas e as características e a estrutura 

do campo de fluxo, em regime laminar e turbulento (considerando k–? e Shear Stress Transport 

k–?’, como modelos de turbulência) foram analisadas. 

As simulações de escoamento do filme de líquido sobre a superfície do evaporador num 

destilador molecular centrífugo em regime turbulento reportaram que os dois modelos de 

turbulência estudados, k–? e SST k–?', são apropriados para simular a distribuição de 

velocidades. No entanto, as simulações conduzidas neste trabalho com os modelos de turbulência 

não refletem alterações significativas na distribuição de velocidade do fluxo sobre a superfície do 

evaporador em relação ao sistema em regime laminar. Assim, a distribuição de velocidade do 

filme de líquido sobre a superfície do evaporador pode ser modelada em regime laminar, a fim de 

simplificar o processo de computação. 

Ao estudar os componentes da velocidade nas direções –r, –? e –?, considerando um 

estado bidimensional estacionário (no padrão de fluxo laminar), apenas o vetor da velocidade na 

direção radial (direção–r) apresenta variação apreciável com as condições operacionais do 

processo da destilação molecular.

Faculdade de Engenharia Química (FEQ) da Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP), 

em parceria com o órgão Financiador de Estudos e Projetos do Ministério da Ciência e 

Tecnologia (FINEP) e o Centro de Pesquisa CENPES/PETROBRAS foi desenvolvida uma 

metodologia, a destilação molecular, para caracterizar os resíduos pesados de petróleo a 

temperaturas superiores daquelas alcançadas pelos métodos padronizados ASTM D 2892 (2005) 

e ASTM D 5236 (2003) (Zuñiga–Liñan et al., 2011; Rocha et al., 2011; Zuñiga, 2009; Zuñiga et 

al., 2009; Zuñiga et al., 2009; Hernández, 2009; Rocha, 2009; Winter et al., 2009; Hernández et

2003; Batistella et al., 2002; Batistella et al., 2000; Batistella e Wolf–Maciel, 1998, 1996). 

Para se ter um panorama abrangente do processo de destilação molecular, informações 

sobre o perfil da temperatura, o da concentração do filme, o da taxa efetiva de evaporação, o da 

taxa de destilado e o da espessura do filme são importantes, pois esses dados permitem avaliar o 

rendimento do processo, a pureza do produto da destilação e definir condições ótimas de 

operação. No entanto, a obtenção experimental desses perfis resulta em um trabalho difícil. Para 

tanto, na indústria pode–se propor a utilização de modelos matemáticos para descrever o 

comportamento dos sistemas, como uma via rápida de baixo custo e eficiente. 

A modelagem do processo da destilação molecular, e nesse caso específico da destilação 

molecular centrífuga, foi baseada nas equações de balanço de massa, energia e momento para o 



178 

filme líquido escoando pela superfície cônica do evaporador. Trabalhos apresentados pelos 

pesquisadores formulam modelos baseados num processo em não–equilíbrio, desprezando o 

fenômeno de re–evaporação e considerando um filme de líquido newtoniano, altamente viscoso, 

e com número de Reynolds pequenos, característicos de fluidos em regime laminar.  

Outra contribuição dos trabalhos teóricos é apresentada neste capítulo, é o 

desenvolvimento de uma ferramenta computacional para auxiliar na modelagem e simulação do 

processo de destilação molecular centrífuga. Essa contribuição serve para estimar e avaliar os 

perfis característicos do processo através das variáveis de saída como: da temperatura, da 

concentração do filme, da taxa efetiva de evaporação, da taxa de destilado e da espessura do 

filme. Esses perfis são função das análises das variáveis operacionais tais como: temperatura da 

alimentação, temperatura do evaporador, pressão do sistema e parâmetros geométricos do 

equipamento que por sua vez dizem respeito à distância entre o evaporador e o condensador, ao 

ângulo médio da superfície cônica e à distância radial da superfície do evaporador. 

A modelagem apresentada neste capítulo é constituída de um sistema de equações 

diferenciais parciais, resolvida pelo método das linhas. Para a simulação, foi considerado como 

caso de estudo o processamento de três resíduos da destilação atmosférica dos petróleos “W”, 

“Y” e “Z” (ATR–W, ATR–Y e ATR–Z, respectivamente) 673,15 K
+
, em um destilador 

molecular centrífugo aquecido, onde a superfície do evaporador constitui uma superfície cônica. 

Os resíduos atmosféricos foram dividido em 25 pseudo–componentes, os quais foram 

caracterizados, em cada caso de estudo, utilizando dados de propriedades físico–químicas geradas 

pelo simulador desenvolvido por Tovar et al. (2011). Os resultados provenientes deste estudo 

permitirão estabelecer apropriadas condições operacionais para a condução de experimentos 

visando, com isso à obtenção de um alto desempenho operacional do equipamento e um melhor 

rendimento da separação. Foram realizados experimentos de destilação molecular com o objetivo 

de validar a ferramenta computacional das simulações.  Os experimentos foram definidos a partir 

de um planejamento de dois níveis do tipo composto central rotacional, onde as variáveis de 

entrada ou independentes para a análise foram: a vazão da alimentação (1,473 – 4,418 kg·h
–1

) e a 

temperatura do evaporador ou temperatura da destilação (423,15 K – 603,15 K). Como variável 

resposta do planejamento foi considerada o rendimento do destilado. Variáveis operacionais de 

entrada (como a agitação na alimentação, a temperatura do condensador e as temperaturas das 

linhas de destilado e do resíduo) foram consideradas constantes no planejamento, pois, estas

variáveis não desempenham um efeito significativo sobre a variável rendimento de destilado 

(Sbaite, 2005; Winter, 2007).

Computational framework for the modeling and simulation of a centrifugal 

molecular distillation process for Brazilian high-boiling-point petroleum 

fractions (petroleum residues): Analysis of the parametric sensitivity of the 

process 

Abstract 

In the case of liquids with low vapor pressure and high molar mass, the molecular 

distillation process presents significant advantages by working in high vacuum and short 

exposure of distilled liquid to elevated temperatures. This study intends to expand the 

understanding of the mechanism of liquid film flowing and evaporating over the evaporator 

surface of a centrifugal molecular distiller. A theoretical and mathematical description of the 

liquid–phase transfer processes in centrifugal molecular distillation is presented for three (03) 

high–boiling–point petroleum fractions divided into twenty five (25) pseudocomponents. The 

thin liquid film over conical evaporator surface is modeled by the mass, momentum, and energy 

balance equations. The theoretical analyses are based on the Langmuir–Knudsen equation 

derived from the kinetic theory of the ideal gas to describe the effective evaporation rate.  The 

equations are included in a computational framework for solving by the method of lines. The 

simulations were carried out at the steady–state setting conditions, where the effects of the 

process variables such as the evaporator temperature, the feed flow rate, the rotor speed and the 

pressure system upon the distillation rates, liquid film profile temperature, effective evaporation 

rate and film liquid thickness were computed and discussed. The procedure made possible to 

relate operating conditions and to determine profiles of surface temperature, total distillate flow 

rate and liquid film thickness. The results presented that the inlet parameters influence 

significantly the output variables. It was shown that the temperature profiles change sharply 

through the layer next to the evaporator surface. Along the length of the conical evaporator 

(radius), the temperature profile inner the liquid film on evaporator surface reached an asymptotic 

temperature in relaxation length behavior as evaporator temperature increases. Therefore, the 

effective evaporation rate and consequently the distillate flow rate increase as well.

1.        Introduction 

The trend in information about the Hi–Tech thermal processes, as molecular distillation 

process, over gentle separation process of thermally unstable mixtures, liquids with low vapor 

pressure and high molar mass, is very interesting due to the significant potential in processing the 

materials and in obtaining products with many advantages. 

During the molecular distillation process, the distilled liquid flows over the heated 

evaporator surface along the characteristic distance (the radial length in centrifugal molecular 

distillation or the length along the cylinder in falling film molecular distillation processes). 

Therefore, the molecular distillation process must be satisfying the following statements: (i) the 

pressure system must be sufficiently low; (ii) the mean free path of molecules must be 

comparable to the size of the equipment (distillation gap) and, (iii) the condenser temperature 

must be lower than the evaporator temperature.  Consequently, evaporated molecules can pass 

through the unobstructed distillation gap to the condenser surface without thermal hazard at a 

reduced distillation temperature, and with short residence time of the distilled liquid on the heated 

surface (Lutišan et al., 2002). 



182 

Moreover, the molecular distillation process performance requires the information about 

the thin liquid film related to the temperature profile (Ts), the velocity profile (?r) and the film 

thickness (?) to determine yield and purity of the distilled product as a function of inlet 

parameters such as evaporator temperature (EVT), feed flow rate (Q), rotor speed (RS), pressure 

system (Ps) as described in Sales–Cruz and Gani (2006). Therefore, the development of a 

mathematical model of the molecular distillation process is important to characterize the liquid 

film on evaporator surface at high vacuum conditions and to describe the separation process 

efficiency through the film profiles. Several studies have presented the modeling of a molecular 

distillation process using two equipment configurations: falling molecular distiller and / or 

centrifugal molecular distiller. Most of the developed models have been reported for binary 

mixtures, based on mass, momentum and energy balance equations. Other works have 

concentrated on specific design issues such residence time, feed temperature, and anisotropic 

properties of the vapor phase, as it is presented in Table 1.

1.1.     Overview of centrifugal molecular distillation modeling 

Centrifugal molecular distillation (CMD) process constitutes a multivariable process, 

based on principles of molecular distillation described before, where it is important to define the 

operating strategy (operating conditions and the interactions among them) focused on the desired 

products and the high performance operation. Several authors have previously suggested the 

modeling of the centrifugal molecular distillation process and the description of the liquid–phase 

transfer processes in high–vacuum condition. 

Batistella et al. (2006) based the design of centrifugal molecular distiller with industrial 

dimensions on the simulation and operational strategy developed for small scale equipment from 

the results obtained from carotenoids recovery from palm oil system. 



184 

Kawala and Dakiniewicz (2002) proposed a design of a evaporator surface based on the 

theoretical framework of the three major ranges of high–vacuum distillation (molecular 

distillation, intermediate range and equilibrium distillation) in which the characteristic quantity 

for each of the ranges was the Knudsen number which expresses a ratio of the mean free path of 

vapor particles to the distance between the evaporator and the condenser surface.  

Batistella and Maciel (1996) suggested a mathematical model for falling film and 

centrifugal molecular distillers. The equations that characterized both processes were the mass, 

energy and momentum balances and the Langmuir equation in order to define the rate of 

evaporation. It was analyzed the effect of operating parameters on the distillation rate. The 

performance of the processes was analyzed for binary systems (dibutyl–phthalate and dilmtyl–

sebacate (DBP–DBS)) and they were compared with results presented in Kawala and Stephan 

(1989). 

Bhandarkar and Ferron (1988) presented a theoretical study to the heat and mass 

transport processes in the liquid over the evaporator surface under high vacuum conditions. 

Results allowed comparing the geometrical parameters and the inlet variables such EVT and Q. It 

was presented an extensively discussion about the influence of the material preheated on the 

performance of the process. The principal assumption in the model was that the evaporation 

process is independent of the vapor–phase properties and the condenser behavior under high 

vacuum is highly efficient. 

Inuzuka et al. (1986) and Inuzuka et al. (1989) developed a mathematical model of heat 

and mass transfer in the liquid film on the centrifugal molecular still comparing with the accuracy 

of approximate solutions with the numerical solutions. The model was based on model suggested 

by Hinze and Milborn (1950). The validity of the mathematical model was reported in 1989 for 

the systems DBP–EHP and EHP–EHS under high vacuum conditions (0.1 Pa). Experiments 

showed good agreements to the numerical solution at evaporator temperature equal to 403 K and 

413 K. 

Kaplon et al. (1986) presented a model based on balance equations and the Langmuir–

Knudsen equation to describe the evaporation rate. The model described the temperature 

distribution in the liquid evaporating film over the rotating disc in high vacuum condition and 

allowed to estimate the surface area of disc required to obtain a desired yield of condensate. The 



 

185 

results showed that the distillate flow rate is related to the initial liquid temperature and the feed 

flow rate.  

Bose and Palmer (1984) developed a theoretical model, as a function of process 

variables, for predicting the separation factor and the evaporation rate of a binary mixture, DBP–

DBS, into a partial vacuum taking into account the transport resistances on separation factor. It 

was also analyzed the coupling between interfacial cooling and surface depletion of the most 

volatile component. The results showed that the surface depletion is the dominant factor 

responsible for the reduction in separation factor as the temperature increases. 

Rees (1980) suggested a mathematical model based on Emslie et al. (1958) and 

Greenberg (1972) models and the theoretical evaporation rate described by Langmuir (1916). The 

mathematical model described that there is a thermal gradient along radial positions to obtain 

changes in the film thickness and evaporation rate profiles. 

In Greenberg (1972) was presented a mathematical model using the approach suggested 

by Emslie et al. (1958). Result showed that predicted film thickness and thermal gradients were 

consistent with values reported in Hickman (1944) for the binary system EHP and EHS. 

Emslie, et al. (1958) presented a study on a Newtonian liquid fluid over a rotating disk. 

It was showed that centrifugal force exerted on a fluid liquid film does not disturb the uniformity 

and it is keeping as a thin layer.  

Hinze and Milborn (1950) proposed a model for the radial velocity profile and thickness 

of the liquid film flowing over a rotating conical surface. It was based on the assumptions that 

tangential velocity component is very small with respect to the radial component, implying that 

the path described by liquid film is practically straight and in radial direction. 

The present work suggests a theoretical study base on a mathematical centrifugal 

molecular distillation model that describes the process of the heat and mass transfer in the 

evaporating liquid film over the evaporator surface from three (03) high–boiling–point petroleum 

fractions (atmospheric distillation residues named as ATR–W, ATR–Y and ATR–Z) from 

Brazilian crude oils with different API gravities (16 – 25 °API) that were distilled by 

conventional atmospheric distillation (ASTM D 2892, 2005). 



186 

The effects of operating conditions such as EVT, Q, RS and Ps on the distillate mass flow 

rate (D), the effective evaporation rate (GE), the film thickness (?), the surface temperature (Ts) 

profiles in the liquid film were investigated and computed along the radial distance (RD). In this 

regard, it has been defined a model to characterize the steady–state flow over the evaporator 

surface driven by the rotation of conical surface in a centrifugal molecular distiller. At this time, 

we focus on the thin liquid film cross–sectional spinning cone as the first solution attempt. The 

study is expected to provide information on the choice of adequate operation conditions for an 

outlook work referred to experimental work with a unique chosen system based on availability 

sample. 

1.2.     Centrifugal molecular distillation description 

The centrifugal molecular distiller consists on a chamber under high vacuum conditions 

which contains the evaporator surface and condenser surface in which it is formed the 

evaporating film (Figure 1a). The surfaces are kept at constant evaporator temperature (EVT) and 

condenser temperature, respectively. In this configuration, it is used close temperature control 

through thermocouples.

The load fed to be processed is pumped into the center of the heated rotating evaporator 

surface housed in a vacuum chamber (Figure 1b). The feed material is spread due to the 

centrifugal force forming a thin liquid film along the evaporator in radial direction. Thus, the film 

thickness profile of the most volatile compound or compounds (pseudocomponents) decrease 

monotonically in the same direction to attain a minimum value for the film thickness as the 

(a) (b) 



 

187 

surface temperature profile increases. The lighter fraction (the most volatile compound or 

compounds) of the load leaves from the heated surface, evaporates, and reaches the cooled 

surface (condenser surface) and condenses, which constitutes the distillate stream. Meanwhile, 

the heavier fraction or unevaporated molecules goes off the chamber into a collecting vessel 

called the residue stream. In this instance, the objective of the molecular distillation process has 

been reached.

In Figure 2 the flow over the evaporator surface is presented where the coordinate s 

instead of ? is introduced as follows:

2.1.     Mathematical description 

The model developed by Inuzuka et al. (1986), Inuzuka et al. (1989) and Batistella and 

Maciel (1996) has been taken for developing a generalized two–dimensional steady state model 

for centrifugal molecular distillation process following the above assumptions: 

• Spherical coordinates system is well–matched to the developed model.  

• The CMD process is in steady state. 



188 

• The liquid film over the evaporator surface is considered to be incompressible, uniformly 

distributed and the film thickness is much smaller than the radius of the conical surface. 

• It is assumed Newtonian fluid and the flow over the evaporator surface is in laminar 

regime. 

• Re–evaporation, splashing phenomena and diffusional process in ?–direction are 

neglected (Sales–Cruz and Gani, 2006). 

• Gravitational force is negligibly in comparison with the centrifugal force. 

• The conical surface rotates at a fixed angular velocity ?. Velocity components (in ?–

direction and ?–directions, respectively) are neglected when compared with the radial 

velocity component (in r–direction). 

• Thermophysical properties (specific heat capacity, thermal conductivity, kinematic 

viscosity, vapor pressure, effective evaporation rate and evaporation enthalpy are function 

of the EVT (at evaporator wall) and surface temperature (Ts) profile inner the thin liquid 

film. 

Based on the above assumptions the mass, momentum and energy balances, the 

mathematical model is described next. 

Momentum balance 

A momentum balance is used below to derive a general differential equation that can be 

then employed to solve thin film flowing over conical evaporator surface in spherical 

coordinates. For this, an incompressible liquid film fluid in laminar regime inner a system of 

radial length, which is at an angle ?’ to the vertical, is considered (Figure 2).

• Input parameters for system characterization: The procedure requires as input bulk 

properties: Boiling Point distillation curve (BP) and whole–fraction density (Tovar et al., 

2011). 

• Input parameters for mathematical model: The computational aided requires fixed 

parameters: The universal gas constant, Avogadro constant and Pi value (?). The geometrical 

parameters such as evaporator radius (ro=0.2662 m), radial distance from entrance load 

(ri=0.03095 m), half angle of apex of cone radius (?’=70°) and distillation gap space 

(L=0.08 m). About process conditions, EVT, Q, RS and Ps are required which play an 

important role in order to analyze the effect of a percent variation on output variables. 

Regarding to the specific model parameters is required the number of intermolecular 

collisions n’ equals five (5) defined by Kawala and Stephan (1989). 

• Subroutine for physicochemical characterization of load material: It contains three 

subroutines for estimating the basic properties (normal boiling point, density and Watson 

factor characterization), the thermodynamic properties (molar mass, density and critical 

properties) and thermophysical properties (viscosity, thermal conductivity, heat capacity and 

enthalpy of evaporation) (Tovar et al., 2011). 

• Subroutine for modeling centrifugal molecular distillation principles: It is estimated the 

mean free path (MFP), the effective evaporation rate (GE), the Knudsen number (Kn) and 

anisotropic degree of the pseudocomponents (k
*
). 

• Subroutine for numerical solution of system equations: The partial differential algebraic 

equations system (PDAEs) comprising the effective evaporation rate model described by 

Equations (9) – (13), and the momentum, mass and energy balances written by Equations 

(32) – (38) and Equations (40) – (41). The PDAEs were solved by a computer aided tool 

with options for analysis of the operating condition, the geometrical parameters, the 

characterization system parameters and the solution of the mathematical model equations. 

The goal of the computational framework was to find the numerical solutions to a model 

with reliable and efficient results. In order to compute a numerical approximation for the 

solution of the boundary condition problem, a subroutine related to the method of lines was 

the numerical method for solving PDEs using centered finite difference relationships for the 



 

197 

spatial derivative (Schiesser, 1991). In addition, for the resulting system, it was included the 

fourth–fifth order Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg (RKF45) subroutine (Mathews and Fink, 2004).  

• Subroutine for linking dimensionless parameter with real variables: In dimensional analysis, 

dimensionless quantities were defined as a product and/or ratio of quantities that might have 

units individually as written in Equations (19) – (31).  The computational aided allowed to 

carry out percentage changes in the operating variables in order to obtain the resulting 

variation in dimensionless variables (r*, Ts*, D*, GE* and ?*); and by means of Equations 

(19) – (31) it was possible to obtain the responses in the output variables Ts, D, GE and ? as 

function of RD. 

• Subroutine for physicochemical characterization of the thin liquid film: It refers to a 

subroutine for estimating the thermophysical properties of the thin liquid film over the 

evaporator surface and distillate stream (reach in volatile compounds) as a function of the Ts 

as RD increases. The subroutine is based on the code developed in the physichochemical 

characterization of the loads materials (Tovar et al., 2011). 

4.        Results and discussion 

Numerical results of surface temperature (Ts), effective evaporation rate (GE), distillate 

flow rate (D) and liquid film thickness (?) profiles have been analyzed from simulated data 

obtained with the computational environment through  the mathematical model developed by 

Inuzuka et al. (1986) and modified, using the effective evaporation rate. Therefore, it was 

adopted for discussing the effect of operating condition on output variables. Typical results from 

these calculations are presented in Figures 4 – 13 for ATR–W, ATR–Y and ATR–Z as follows. 

The centrifugal molecular distillation mathematical model allowed to predict the entire 

Ts profile along the radial position (RD) showing a continuous variation, which means that the GE 

is highly affected by the EVT. However, the effect of Ps was not very noticeable in any of the 

studied output variables (Figure 4). Nevertheless, from the simulated data it was found that the 

main operating characteristic was the Ps range from 0.1 to 0.13 Pa. Under these conditions, the 

volatility of the components increases satisfying the principle of molecular distillation based on 

the MFP of the evaporating molecules as discussed in Tovar (2012).

4.1.     Effect of EVT on output variables 

In Figures 5 –  7, for ATR–W, ATR–Y and ATR–Z, respectively, Ts of the liquid film is 

shown as a function of the RD along the evaporator surface. As shown in Equation (41), the 

dimensionless surface temperature is determined by a differential equation of dimensionless 

parameters Ts*; which is associated to the fluid properties, geometric parameters and processing 

conditions. Therefore, once D* (Equation 40)  and Ts* (Equation 41) were evaluated it was rather 

simple to determine the Ts of the film by solving the nonlinear Equations (20) – (25).  

The EVT is the most important governing condition in the evaporating flow, linked with 

the phenomena related to how fast the front of liquid film flow advances along the evaporator 

surface and how the fluid flow changes into the vapor state over the evaporator surface.   

For the study of the EVT effect, it was extensively carried out computational simulations 

for nine (09) possible combinations of operating conditions in the range of EVT at fixed Q, RS 

and Ps. In Figures 5a , 6a and 7a, considering a reference value of EVT equals 423.15 K, if EVT 

increase, the Ts increases along of RD and it approaches to an upper limit value corresponding to 

the asymptotically behavior; except in cases in which critical operating conditions were found as 

described later. For ATR–W, the upper values asymptotically reached were 451.88 K (at +5% of 

EVT), 472.35 K (at +10% of EVT), 512.65 K (at +20% of EVT) and 551.97 K (at +30% of EVT) 

(Figure A1 in appendix A). Whereas, if EVT decreases, the Ts profile decreases relatively slowly 

but keeping the asymptotical tend forward with upper limit as 410.54 K (at –5% of EVT), 389.72 

K (at –10% of EVT), 347.78 K (at -20% of EVT) and 305.58 K (at -30% of EVT) (Figure A1 in 

appendix A). 

Furthermore, results showed that the radial thermal gradients inner the thin liquid film 

produced a significantly change in the GE and D. Figures 5b – 5c, 6b – 6c, and 7b –7c showed 

that the GE and D varied strongly after the center of evaporator surface. Based on statements that 

the GE is greatly influenced by EVT, the concept of relaxation length was applied for understand 

the effect on this output variable. The relaxation length concept refers to the radial position at 

which a given parameter (Ts and GE) reaches asymptotic value (Cvengroš et al., 2000). Therefore, 

in reference to the GE at 0.2662 m, for the ATR–W case study, the upper limits were 12.46 kg·m

  (at +30% of EVT). In contrast, if the EVT decreases (in reference to 



 

200 

EVT=423.15 K), the GE of the most volatile pseudocomponents reaches asymptotic values, at 

relaxation length of 0.2500 m, of 10.22 kg·m

  (at -20% of EVT) and 5.76 kg·m

  (at -30% of EVT) as shown in Figure 

5b. 

On the other hand, for ATR–Y and ATR–Z cases studies, it was possible to identify 

some critical operating conditions for the centrifugal molecular distillation process, where the GE 

is not enough for evaporating molecules and the amount of distillate flow rate became 

insignificant. Thus, when EVT decreases, GE is lower, regarding to the value at entrance of liquid 

film on evaporator surface, and GE reaches lower asymptotic limits (at relaxation length 0.2500 

m).  

For ATR–Y case study, as shown in Figures  6b, at EVT values higher than 423.15 K, 

the upper limits of the GE were: 8.98 kg·m

  (at +20% of EVT) and 13.37 kg·m

 (at -5% of EVT) and 6.24 kg·m

  (at -10% of EVT).  For ATR–Z case study (Figure

 (at +5% of EVT), 7.28 kg·m
-2

·s

 (at +10% of 

EVT) and 9.56 kg·m
-2

·s
-1

 (at +20% of EVT). In contrast, if EVT is lower than 423.15 K, the GE 

decreases. Thus, at -5%, -10% and -20% of EVT, the GE goes from 4.75, 4.63 and 4.41 kg·m
-2

·s

(at RD=0.03095 m), respectively, to 4.44, 3.56 and 2.36 kg·m
-2

·s
-1

 (at RD=0.2662 m and -5%, -

10% and -20% of EVT, respectively). At -30% of EVT, it was not possible to analyze this 

operating condition duo to the fact that the volatile compounds do not attain the enough 

temperature for evaporating and travels in the distillation gap.  

Related to Ts profiles along the evaporator surface, results for ATR–Y in Figure 6a (and 

in Figure A2 appendix A) and for ATR–Z in Figure 7a (and in Figure A3 appendix A) showed a 

limiting and critical operating condition, where as EVT decreases, the Ts decreases along of the 

evaporator surface and it approaches to the lower limit value where the temperature is not enough 

for evaporating. In consequence, GE and D of the most volatile compounds become vary slightly 

along the flow pathway over the evaporator surface. 

 It was evident that the centrifugal molecular distillation process is strongly influenced 

by the EVT. Accordingly, as the EVT is raised, GE and D increase when the amount of the more 



 

201 

volatile component decrease because the molecules move more vigorously and increasing the 

energy to escape from the evaporator surface and reached the condenser surface. However, the 

EVT effects on GE, D and ? at constant Q, RS and Ps allowed bringing to a close that if it is 

desired to distill more undesired components out, the EVT should be lower. Contrarily, when the 

distillate flow is desired, the EVT should be appropriately high to prevent more undesired 

components are distilled, and subsequently, the distillate flow rate is increased.  

In Figures 5d, 6d and 7d (for ATR–W, ATR–Y and ATR–Z, respectively) is presented 

the ? profile for different values of EVT in the range of 296.21 K (-30% of EVT) to 550.10 K 

(+30% of EVT). The radial distance, RD, is plotted on the abscissa and the film thickness, ?, on 

the ordinate. It can be seen that the greatest changes in the film thickness profile occurred in the 

region between 0.03095 m to 0.1500 m corresponding to the entrance section of the feed material 

and center section of the evaporator surface.

203 

Analyzing the highest and the lowest conditions of EVT, is was depicted a continuous 

decrease of the thin liquid film as RD increases as follows: (i) at the highest EVT condition (at 

+30% of EVT for ATR–W and ATR–Y, and at +20% of EVT for ATR–Z), the ? decreases as RD 

increases and does so rapidly from 2.52x10
-3

 m to 5.39x10
-4

 for ATR–W, from 1.04x10
-3

  to 

2.38x10
-4

  for ATR–Y and  from 1.38x10
-3

  to 3.06x10
-4

  for ATR–Z.  (ii) When it was 

considered the lowest EVT condition , (at -30% of EVT for ATR–W and ATR–Y, and at -20%  of 

EVT for ATR–Z),  the ? decreases so rapidly from 6.03x10-3 m to 7.75x10-4 for ATR–W, from 

5.23x10
-3

  to 8.04x10
-4

  for ATR–Y and  from 3.98x10
-3

  to 8.35x10
-4

  for ATR–Z. 

Hence, when a thin liquid film of a multicomponent flows over a heated evaporator 

surface, under vacuum conditions (i.e. 0.13 Pa), evaporation phenomenon at the free surface, 

leads to depletion of the most volatile component or components in the liquid phase, forming a 

thin liquid film that, evenly, might to condense along the condenser surface. As a result, the 

distillate flow rate increases as consequence of: (i) The elevated film surface temperature; (ii) the 

decrease of the film thickness on the evaporator surface and, (iii) advantageous operating 

conditions on the centrifugal molecular distillation process. 

4.2.     Effect of Q on output variables 

In order to provide a qualitative and quantitative physical insight inner the evaporating 

liquid film over the evaporator surface device, it was extensively performed the parametric 

studies on the flow behavior in terms of the Ts, GE, D and ?, as functions of Q at EVT, RS and Ps 

fixed. 

In Figures 8 – 10, the relationship of Ts, GE, D and ?  versus RD is shown with Q as 

parameter sensitivity. In Figures 8a, 9a and 10a as Q increases, Ts profiles reach asymptotic 

values in correspondence with the rises of the relaxation length.  In the studied range of Q, the 

temperature difference in the radial direction was very small. These relatively small radial 

gradients might be ascribed to the low thermal conductivity, about 1.22 W·m

·k
-1

 for ATR–W, 

1.13 W·m
-1

·k
-1

 for ATR–Y and 0.85 W·m
-1

·k
-1

 for ATR–Z, to conduct heat transferred from the 

evaporator surface to the inner of the liquid film. 

The slight rise of Ts (Figures 8a, 9a and 10a) and GE (Figures 8b, 9b and 10b) as Q 

decreases is related mainly to the good mass transfer over the evaporator surface and, 



 

204 

consequently, to the increase of evaporation of volatile compounds.  In addition, the liquid film at 

lower Q values had lower relaxation length that means, at Q values between 1.000 kg·h
-1

 and 

1.500 kg·h
-1

, the relaxation length was around 0.2000 m; while at Q values between 1.500 kg·h
-1

 

and 2.000 kg·h
-1

, the relaxation length was around 0.2500 m. Therefore, Q parameter influenced 

directly on the liquid film thickness and mass transfer, once values of Q lower than 1.000 kg·h
-1

 

may not be high enough to efficient mass and heat transfers. On the other hand, for Q values 

higher than 2.000 kg·h
-1

, the system might operate with low effectiveness because the residence 

time of the molecules on the evaporator might be too low. 

Figures 8d, 9d and 10d show the development of the ? along the evaporator length in r–

direction for various liquid loads. The ? profile was affected by the change of Q condition. Thus, 

it is noted that lower ?  values were reached at low values of Q, which is the same trend as the 

analyses reported for EVT effects, confirming in these conditions, that a uniform thin film 

promotes high efficiency in the mass and in the energy transfers.

4.3.     Effect of RS on output variables 

The aim of this section is to determine the profiles of Ts, GE, and ? along the RD of the 

evaporator in dependence on RS parameter at constant EVT, Q and Ps. As mentioned in the 

analyses of EVT and Q effects, GE and ? profiles represent the determining factor for the 

centrifugal molecular distillation process. With respect to the heat transfer, two regions can be 

elucidated: (i) the temperature profile at the entrance section of conical evaporator surface from 

0.03095 m to 0.1000 m and, (ii) a fully developed Ts profile from 0.1000 m to 0.2662 m.  

In Figures 11a, 12a and 13a for ATR–W, ATR.Y and ATR–Z, respectively, it can be 

seen that as the RS increases, the first region presented a uniform Ts profile increasing 

monotonically with a gradient of 0.05 K·m
-1

 to RD about 0.1000 m as RS increases. In the first 

section, evaporation of liquid was negligible in comparison with the section between 0.100 m and 

0.2662 m. In contrast, the second section was characterized by the developed Ts profile inner the 

liquid film. For high values of RS, GE increases rapidly and, in consequence, the efficiency of 

centrifugal molecular distillation process increased exponentially along the RD, resulting in the 

correspondingly exponential increase of D due to the increase of the induced centrifugal force, 

which is known as the flow driving force in the system. 

Figures 11b, 12b and 13b for ATR–W, ATR–Y and ATR–Z, respectively, show that GE 

strongly increases as the RS increases, due to Ts dependence and RS conditions that affected the 

viscosity of film on evaporator surface. Using the concept to relaxation behavior, different 

relaxation lengths for GE were confirmed. Thus, as RS and RD increase, GE reached asymptotic 

values in 0.2200 m for ATR–W, 0.2400 m for ATR–Y and 0.2500 m for ATR–Z. 

In Figures 11c, 12c and 13c is presented D profiles which are more sensitively affected 

by the change of RS than Q due to the fact that the RS is proportional to the generated centrifugal 

force inner the system and, in front of that, the ? profile is affected. 

 In Figures 11d, 12d and 13d, ? profiles are plotted as a function of RD with RS as 

parameter. In this sense, when RS increases up to 1300 rpm (+30% of RS), ? of evaporating liquid 

film decreases and reaches 6.08x10
-4

 m for ATR–W, 5.58x10
-4

  m for ATR–Y and 4.63x10
-4

  m

Furthermore, the effect of RS showed the existence of large temperature gradients along 

the evaporator surface, and for this reason, GE gradients were rather pronounced. Accordingly, 

the low resistance to mass and heat transfer in the evaporating film is advantageous for the 

centrifugal molecular distillation process once, the distillate stream, the desired product, 

apparently increases as RS increases. This engages to the fact that the distillation speed increases 

when the liquid film over the evaporator surface becomes more uniform when RS is increased 

ensuring the short residence time of the liquid load over the evaporator surface and the  

distributing in the form of a thin liquid film. 

5.        Conclusions 

A mathematical model of the thin liquid film flowing over the evaporator surface in the 

centrifugal molecular distillation process was presented based on the model proposed by Inuzuka 

et al. (1986) including the modified Knudsen–Langmuir equation for representing the effective 

evaporation rate. The mathematical description was built up in FORTRAN–90 language using 

Compaq Visual Fortran compiler (professional edition 6.6) comprising a computational 



 

209 

environment for analyzing the heat and mass transfers in the liquid film of ATR–W, ATR–Y and 

ATR–Z on the rotating evaporator surface of a centrifugal molecular distiller. Therefore, the 

mathematical model presented in this work allows a reasonable theoretical approach for 

prediction of the centrifugal molecular distillation performance from atmospheric petroleum 

residue. 

The computational framework allowed carrying out qualitative and quantitative 

sensitivity analyses from different operating condition, such as EVT, Q and RS, in percent 

variation, on output variables such as surface temperature (Ts), distillate flow rate (D), effective 

evaporation rate (GE) and film thickness profiles (?) as a function of radial distance (RD) from the 

apex of the conical surface to the external distance at which the liquid film is completely 

evaporated. Hence, it is suggested that the main operating variables for this particular process 

were EVT and RS, which marked some limiting conditions for carrying out future theoretical and 

experimental works. 

The simulations data reported that the liquid film thickness is affected by the evaporator 

temperature, rotor speed, liquid viscosity and the difference in temperature between the 

evaporator wall and the evaporating liquid. Thus, the effectiveness of molecular distillation 

process from ATR–W, ATR–Y and ATR–Z was evaluated by minimum film thickness, high 

distillate flow rate and high effective evaporation rate as consequence of the depletion 

phenomenon of the most volatile compound or compounds (pseudocomponents) and efficient 

mass and heat transfers inner the evaporating liquid film over the evaporator surface device.

Reliability–based optimization using surface response methodology to split 

heavy petroleum fractions by centrifugal molecular distillation process 

Abstract 

The present work aimed to develop an experimental and computational study for 

optimizing the centrifugal molecular distillation process to split heavy petroleum fractions. On 

the basis of the balance equations and Langmuir–Knudsen equation, a mathematical model was 

proposed. The influence of the evaporator temperature (EVT), volumetric feed flow rate (Q) and 

the interactions between them, on the overall distillate mass flow rate (D) and the distillate yield 

(%D) was analyzed. A full 22 factorial central plus star rotatable (?=±?2) composite design was 

performed in the experimental range from 423.15 to 603.15 K for EVT and from 1.473 to 4.418 

kg·h-1 for Q. The optimized conditions, using the response surface methodology, established that 

the EVT must range from 540 to 600 K and the Q from 1.5 to 3.5 kg·h-1. The comparison of the 

experiment results with the predicted model results shows an acceptable qualitative agreement 

between the experiment and simulated data.  

Keywords: Molecular distillation, heavy petroleum fractions, reliability–based 

optimization, distillate mass flow rate, numerical simulation.

1.        Introduction 

The petroleum industry and research groups have committed efforts to develop and 

improve process technologies for the upgrading of petroleum residue. The residue is defined as a 

liquid or semi–liquid product obtained as the residue from the atmospheric and vacuum 

distillation of petroleum and consisting principally of asphaltic hydrocarbons with a low H/C 

ratio (1.2–1.4) (1,2). 

However, a novel technique based on the molecular distillation process has been 

developed by the Separation Processes Development Laboratory and the Laboratory of 

Optimization, Project and Advanced Control  (LDPS/LOPCA/UNICAMP) sponsored by the 

Research Center of Petrobras–Brazil (CENPES/Petrobras) and Brazilian Study and Project 

Financing Institution (FINEP). It constitutes one of the best non–conventional processes to split 

and characterize heavy liquid petroleum fractions (3–10). 

 The molecular distillation process is a Hi–Tech thermal and special liquid–liquid 

separation technology, in which the good distribution of the liquid in a uniform thin film is 

guaranteed (10–12).  Basically, the principle of molecular distillation is related to the vapor 



219 

molecules generated that find a free path between the evaporator and the condenser surfaces 

under high vacuum conditions. In centrifugal molecular distillation (CMD) process, a type of 

molecular distillation, the centrifugal force is used to enhance the performance of the process. 

The rapid flow of the liquid film makes the residence time in the device extremely short, which 

offers some advantages with respect to the chemical degradation of the products (13–17).  Under 

these conditions, theoretically, the evaporation rate should only be governed by the rate of escape 

of molecules from the liquid surface, and therefore, phase equilibrium does not exist (5,6,18). 

The combination of a small distance between the evaporator and the condenser (from 0.02 to 0.08 

m) with a high vacuum in the distillation gap results in a specific mass transfer mechanism with 

evaporation outputs as high as 20 – 40 g·m?2·s?1 (15). 

Over the last years, the molecular distillation process has been recognized as a 

multidisciplinary process concerning the feedstock, operating conditions and configuration 

strategies for the equipment (Table 1). Experimental procedures and theoretical studies have been 

developed. These studies involved the stripping,  separation, concentration and extraction of 

components  from  natural products,  the separation  of mono–, di– and triacylglycerols, 

extraction of fatty  acids and the characterization of petroleum fractions, which  are  applications  

related  to the food, chemical, pharmaceutical and petrochemical areas (8–10,19–32).

This work presents the use of the CMD process to split heavy petroleum fractions using 

both theoretical and experimental studies. In the first part, a central composite factorial design 

was used to analyze the operating conditions of the centrifugal molecular distillation process with 

respect to the distillate stream. The independent variables studied were the evaporator 

temperature (EVT) and the feed flow rate (Q), and the dependent variables were the overall 

distillate mass flow rate (D) and the yield of distillate stream (%D). The experimental factorial 

design allowed one to define and to analyze the effect of each independent variable on the 

dependent variables and to optimize the conditions using the response surfaces and statistical 

model. All the data were treated with the software Statistica 7.0 from Statsoft Inc (33). The 

qualities of the fitted models were evaluated by analyzing the variance (ANOVA). 

The theoretical study comprised the mathematical description and the numerical results 

of the centrifugal molecular distillation process to split heavy petroleum fractions. The theoretical 

study was illustrated for an atmospheric petroleum residue (ATR–W 673.15 K+) divided into 

twenty five pseudocomponents (34). The mathematical model was based on a highly viscous 

liquid film flow, and hence with small Reynolds numbers, and the velocity profile was fully 

developed (35–36).  

The process under study was modeled according to the mass, momentum and energy 

balance equations. Computational analyses are based on the Langmuir–Knudsen equation, 

derived from the kinetic theory of the ideal gas for the effective evaporation rate. The simulations 

were carried out under steady–state conditions, and the output variables, such as surface 

temperature (Ts), film thickness (?), effective evaporation rate (GE) and distillate mass flow rate 

(D) profiles were computed. The set of partial differential algebraic equations was solved by a 

computer aided environment developed in FORTRAN programming language, using the method 

of lines.  

2.        Mathematical description 

The thin liquid film flowing over the rotating evaporator surface in the centrifugal 

molecular still is depicted in Fig. 1. The conical surface rotates at angular velocity ?. The liquid 

is brought up to the cone surface at a radius ri, which means, that the liquid is fed to the conical 

surface at radius ri and left at ro.

Figure 1. Sketch of the evaporator surface and its coordinate system. 

 

The thin liquid film flowing over conical evaporator surface in the centrifugal molecular 

distiller obeys the follows assumptions: 

• Spherical coordinates system is suited to the model. However some simplifications are 

made based on the fact that the film is very thin. 

• Liquid flow is considered in steady state. 

• Liquid film thickness is very small in comparison with the radius of the conical surface. 

• Tangential and meridional velocity components are negligibly small in comparison with 

the radial component. 

• The thin liquid film is completely viscous and it is in laminar pattern flow. 

• The liquid has the same rotational speed as the rotational surface. 

• Gravitational force is negligibly in comparison with the centrifugal force. 



223 

• A coordinate s instead of ? is introduced ( d ds r ?? = ). 

The model developed by Inuzuka et al. (36) has been taken to propose a generalized 

two–dimensional steady state mathematical model of the centrifugal molecular distillation from 

heavy petroleum fraction. It comprises the temperature, velocity, film thickness, effective 

evaporation rate and distillate mass flow rate profiles. 

2.1.     Momentum balance equation 

A momentum balance is used below to derive a general differential equation that can be 

then employed to solve thin film flowing over conical evaporator surface in spherical 

coordinates. For this, an incompressible liquid film fluid in laminar regime inner a system of 

radial length, which is at an angle ?’ to the vertical, is considered (Fig. 1).  

The continuity equation can be written as Eq. (1):

2.3.     Anisotropic condition and effective rate of evaporation 

The evaporation rate is an important factor in evaluating the efficiency of the molecular 

distillation process. Evaporation proceeds at a different rate and the vapor phase presents 

different physical properties as consequences of the fact that the gas behaves like a collection of 

independent particles. Thus, the appropriate vapor phase dynamic regime is determined by means 

of the Knudsen number (Kn), Eq. (3), which expresses the ratio of the mean free path (MFP) of 

the vapor phase to a characteristic length (L), such as the boundary layer thickness, or a 

molecular distiller device dimension (the distance between the evaporator and the condenser 

surface) (37).

MFP
Kn

L

(3) 

In the case of a molecular distillation process, Kn&gt;0.1 explains the fact that the vapor 

phase shows anisotropic behavior, which means that, at Kn &gt; 0.1 intermolecular collisions in the 

region of interest (space between the evaporator and the condenser surfaces) are much less 

frequent than molecular interactions (37). In the other cases, the Knudsen number is less than 0.1, 

and thus the vapor has isotropic properties and behaves as continuous matter, such that the 

number of collisions between the molecules increases and the molecules can reach the condenser, 

but can also return to the evaporator surface and attain equilibrium; not a valid state in the 

process (37). 

Nevertheless, with short distances between the evaporator and the condenser and a low 

number of collisions, evaporation of the molecules proceeds at the maximal rate described by the 

Langmuir–Knudsen equation (Eq. 4) (36,38–39).

Where GT is the theoretical rate of evaporation, Pvap is the equilibrium vapor pressure at 

the absolute temperature Ts, M is the molar mass of the compound, and Rg is the universal gas 

constant. 

Therefore the molecular distillation process is a function of the molecular species and 

the surface temperature, that is, the molecular distillation process is a surface phenomenon (40). 

The effective rate of evaporation (GE) of each component is calculated using a modified 

Langmuir–Knudsen equation, where conditions in the vapor phase, above the thin evaporating 

liquid film, influence the effective mean free path of the molecules, as described by Eq. (5) 

(37,41):

Where the coefficient f represents the fraction of vaporized molecules that reach the 

condenser and is expressed as follows (37):

3.        Methods and materials 

Case study: The objective was to split the heavy petroleum atmospheric residue (ATR) 

673.15 K+ of “W” crude oil. The total residue was divided into twenty five pseudocomponents 

for the simulating process, and in the simulation environment, the sample was characterized using 

the computational approach developed by Tovar et al. (34). 

3.1.     The centrifugal molecular distillation experiments 

The equipment used in the experiments was a centrifugal molecular distiller (with an 

evaporation surface area of 0.1935  m2) built and sponsored by the Laboratory for the 

Development of Separation Processes (LDPS) and the Laboratory of Optimization, Project and 

Advanced Control (LOCA) at the School of Chemical Engineering (FEQ) of the State University 

of Campinas (UNICAMP), the Research Center of Petrobras–Brazil (CENPES/Petrobras) and 

Brazilian Study and Project Financing Institution (FINEP). The layout of the centrifugal 

molecular distiller is shown in Fig. 2.

The centrifugal molecular distiller is formed by the heated evaporator and the cooling–

condenser surface with an electrical heating system. It also includes the temperature, pressure and 

flow rate control units. The module is completed by a vacuum unit composed of two vacuum 

pumps: a mechanical vacuum pump and another diffuser pump. The centrifugal force allows for 

the formation of a thin liquid film that passes through the heated disk and makes contact with the 

condenser surface. The use of the central rotational heated disk is a mechanical way of creating a 

thin liquid film well distributed over the evaporator surface.  

The tests started when the conditions for EVT and Q were defined. The equipment was 

stabilized and the operational conditions were reached. Approximately 2 h were necessary to 

stabilize the system. The raw material is driven up to the evaporator by a feed system at the 

predetermined Q value, where the material is heated (at 353.15 K) and subsequently driven by a 

tube (kept at 423.15 K) up to the centre of the rotor of the evaporator. The evaporator rotation 

velocity was 540 rpm, which provides a uniform film throughout the distiller due to the 

centrifugal force. The typical pressure of the system was 0.4 Pa. The condenser temperature was 

maintained at 353.15 K.  

When the raw material was submitted to the CMD process, two product streams are 

generated: the distillate stream rich in the molecules that escape from the evaporator and get to 

the condenser surface; and the residue stream rich in the heavier molecules that remain on the 

evaporator surface and which did not reach the condenser surface. Non–condensable molecules 

are exhausted and confined in the trap gap, where they are condensed by a liquid at temperature 

of 273.15 K. In order to evaluate the liquid yield as function of distillate mass flow rate (D) and 

residue mass flow rate (R) Eq. 15 was used.

3.2.     Physicochemical Characterization  

In order to evaluate the success of the process, the fractions (11 distillates and 11 

residues) from CMD were assayed by colloidal characterization using size exclusion 

chromatography (SEC) with UV–absorption detection, for the determination of the molar mass 

distribution. In addition, physicochemical properties of distillate and residue streams, density, 

relative density and API gravity, were determined. 



228 

3.2.1.     Rheological analysis of distillate and residue streams obtained from CMD process 

The experimental measurements were performed using a HAAKE RheoStress 6000–UTC 

rheometer (Thermo Electron Corporation, Karlsruhe, Germany), with a plate–plate sensor system 

constituted by two (02) parallel plates (PP35 and PP60) of 0.035 m of diameter (for ATR–W 

sample and residue streams) and 0.060 m of diameter (for distillate streams). The flow behavior 

of the ATR–W and products streams (distillate and residue) obtained from CMD was investigated 

over a wide range of shear rates at 343.15 K, 363.15 K and 373.15 K for ATR–W; 372.15 K for 

distillate streams and 423.15 K for residue streams. The test temperature was maintained at a 

constant value and controlled to allow a maximum deviation of ±0.1 K with a HAAKE universal 

temperature controller (Thermo Electron Corporation, Karlsruhe, Germany). The rheological 

measurements referred to the analyses of transition between non–Newtonian and Newtonian 

behavior obtained from an analysis of the flow curve prepared using the controlled rate mode and 

at the shear rate range from 10 to 700 s–1 with measurements being made every 10 s-1. The 

dynamic viscosity values were determined from simple linear regression through the set of 70 

experimental data since. Regression tool of HAAKE RheoWin Job Manager software (Version 

3.61.0000) was used. In order to determine the Newtonian behavior, data must obey the general 

equation (Eq. 16): 

? µ?=  (16) 

Where ? is the shear stress (Pa), µ is the dynamic viscosity (Pa?s) and ? is the shear rate 

(s-1). Using experimental data, when ? is plotted against ?, a straight line is obtained. With this 

linear relation, the µ is calculated from the slope of the straight line. 

3.2.2.     Analysis of density of distillate and residue streams  

The ASTM D 4052 (43) and ASTM D5002 (44) standard methods, for density 

measurements in the petroleum  industry, were used to determine the density and relative density 

at 293.15 K of the distillate streams obtained from CMD process. The tests were performed 

through the Density Meter DMA 4500 –  Anton Paar. A built–in Peltier thermostat automatically 

ensured the correct measuring temperature at 293.15 K. The repeatability is not worse than 

±3x10-4 g?cm-3. Averages among repetitions (mean value of triplicate determinations) and 

standard deviation were determined and analyzed. On the other hand, density measurements of 



229 

residue streams were analyzed using the pycnometer method following the standard method 

ASTM D 70 (45). 

3.2.3.     Colloidal characterization 

The chromatographic system, VISCOTEK GPC/SEC TDAmaxTM (Viscotek 

Corporation, Houston, TX, USA), comprises a VISCOTEK GPCmax (VE2001) solvent/sample 

module, a VISCOTEK TDA 302 triple detector array, three GPC/SEC Phenolgel analytical 

columns (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) in series, a VISCOTEK UV detector model 2501 and 

OmniSEC software (Version 4.5.0.257).The products (distillate and residue streams) were 

analyzed using size exclusion chromatography on three GPC/SEC Phenolgel analytical columns 

(Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) with different pore sizes (50–100 Å), dimensions of 300 mm x 7.8 

mm and packed with spherical styrene divinylbenzene copolymer beads with a particle size of 5 

µm. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) (HPLC grade UV, Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, New Jersey) was 

used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.7 mL·min-1, and the column temperature was 

maintained at 313.15±1 K during the analyses. The samples (distillate and residue streams) were 

introduced through a 20 µL loop injection valve and detection was by means of UV absorption at 

340 nm. The molecular mass distribution with the number and weight average molar masses (Mn 

and Mw) and the polydispersity index (PID) were calculated by OmniSEC software (Version 

4.5.0.257).  

The GPC/SEC Phenolgel detectors used for the determination of the molar mass 

distributions were calibrated for molar mass versus retention volume using several polystyrenes 

(PS580, PS1300, PS2497, PS5460, PS8864, PS12347, PS16953 and PS28500) and hydrocarbon 

(naphthalene, tetralin, carbazole, ammonium heptamolybdate) standards. The calibration curve 

was fitted using a cubic equation (Eq. 17) with a regression square coefficient of 0.98.

3.3.     Factorial experiments for optimization 

The use of molecular distillation to split heavy petroleum fractions was the subject of 

experimental and theoretical research by (8–10). They evaluated the influence of the operational 



230 

conditions of the molecular distillation process, such as the evaporator temperature (EVT) and 

feed flow rate (Q), on the dependent variables i.e. overall distillate mass flow rate (D) and the 

distillate yield (%D). 

Preliminary studies by the author’s research group with other systems showed that the 

variables EVT and Q were the ones that had the greatest effect on the response variable in the 

molecular process (9,16). However, in our previous paper, parametric sensitivity of the 

centrifugal molecular distillation from the high–boiling–point petroleum fraction ATR–W 

showed that the evaporator temperature (EVT) and rotor speed (RS) are the main operating 

variables for this particular process. Thus, in a preceding experimental exercise it was observed 

that when RS variable varied from 700 rpm to 1300 rpm, the evaporator surface device exhibited 

an oscillation or vibration which made impossible the operation and it does not guarantee a 

uniform film on the evaporator surface.  Hence, the input variables considered for the 

optimization were the EVT and Q, setting the rotor speed (RS) at 540 rpm. 

A central composite factorial design, which takes all the degrees of freedom into account 

was used. The general form of this factorial design is 2n plus a star configuration (
( )1 4

2n?± = ), 

with a central point, where n is the number of factors (in this case EVT and Q) and 2 represents 

the two levels of work. The levels are identified as the low level (- 1) and the high level (+1) and 

the central point (0), as shown in Table 2. The central point (0) is very important since it 

represents a set of experimental conditions at which three (03) replicates were run, and is used to 

calculate the standard deviations. In this study, a 22 full–factorial central composite design with 4 

axial (star configuration) and 3 central points was used, resulting in 11 experiments.

based on the formation of a thin film on the evaporator surface, on the thermal conditions 

required to avoid cracking of the feedstock, and on the operating range of the centrifugal 

molecular distillation unit. Table 3 shows the design matrix for the 11 experiments. The distillate 

mass flow rate (D) and the distillate yield (%D) were defined as the dependent variables.

3.4.    Response surface methodology  

Using response surface methodology, non–linear multiple regression models were fitted 

for the dependent variables (D and %D). Based on the central composite factorial design, 

independent and dependent variables were fitted to a second–degree polynomial equation (Eq. 

18), where D and %D were the estimated responses, ?i the coefficient related to the direct 

influence of the independent variables, ?ij the coefficients of the statistical model related to the 

possible linear interactions amongst the independent variables EVT and Q; and ?ii, and ?jj the 

coefficients corresponding to the quadratic influence of the independent variables.

The response surfaces and related contour diagrams were calculated for the two

ridge behaviors in the quadratic response surfaces were identified. 



232 

The qualities of the fitted models were evaluated analyzing the variance (ANOVA), and 

verifying if the models reproduced the experimental data in the range studied. The F–test and the 

percentage of explained variance were also checked (46). 

4.        Results and discussion 

4.1.     Influence of operating conditions  

Table 3 shows the coded factors used for EVT and Q and the experiments that were 

carried out for the central composite factorial design of the 11 trials. It consisted of a complete 22 

factorial design (levels ?1 and +1) plus a star configuration (levels ??2 and +?2), with a central 

point (level 0). The repetition at the central point was used to estimate the error. The results for 

the distillate mass flow rate (D) obtained in the experimental trials and the distillate yield (%D), 

are presented in the final columns.  

The estimated effects of both variables are outlined in Table 4. The significant effects 

were calculated using the p–value and confidence interval concepts. Accordingly, it was possible 

to investigate a quadratic polynomial relationship of the independent variables on D and %D. 

Thus, the statistical analysis showed that, at the 95% confidence interval, the linear factors EVTl 

and Ql and the quadratic factor EVTq presented significant effects on the variable D (Table 4). On 

the other hand for the variable %D the linear factors EVTl and Ql, the quadratic factors EVTq and 

Qq and the interactions between the linear factors presented significant effects (Table 4).

4.2.     Optimization of the experimental conditions and response surface methodology 

The experimental data were analyzed by non–linear multiple regression using the 

software Statistica 7.0 from Statsoft Inc (33). The models expressed by Eqs. (19) – (20), in terms 

of independent variables, were generated, representing the overall distillate mass flow rate (D) 

and the distillate yield (%D) as a function of the more significant variables as follows:

Table 6 shows the ANOVA for the quadratic models. According to the ANOVA, the 

responses presented high correlation coefficients (&gt;0.96). The qualities of the fitted models were 

checked. The ratio between the mean square regression (MSqR) and the mean square residual 

(MSqr), F–ratioR/r, was used to establish if the models were statistically significant.  Also, the 

ratio between the mean square lack of fit (MSqLOF) and the mean square pure error (MSqPE), the 

F–ratioLOF/PE, was used to evaluate if the models were well adjusted to the observations. High 

values for the F–ratioLOF/PE are evidence of a lack of fit of the models. Thus Eq. (19) was 

predictive for D and statistically significant under the experimental conditions studied, for a high 

percentage of explained variance (99.99 %), and close to the percentage of explained variance 



234 

predicted by the mathematical model (96.52 %). The calculated F–ratioR/r  (64.717) was more 

than fourteen times higher than the F–valueR/r  at a 95 % confidence interval   (F0.95;3;7 = 4.347), 

which is in good agreement with the practical rule, that establishes that the model has statistical 

significance when the calculated F–value is at least three to five times larger than the listed 

value) (47). Furthermore, Table 6 shows the ANOVA analysis, and the model from Eq. (19) fit 

the experimental data well, since the calculated F–ratioLOF/PE (15.048) was lower than the critical 

F–valueLOF/PE  (F0.95;5;2 = 19.295) in the 95 % confidence interval. 

On the other hand, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) for %D model from Eq. (20) is 

also shown in Table 6. The response has a correlation coefficient (R2) equal to 0.982 and the F–

test shows that the model was reliable, since the calculated F–value was 10.74 times larger than 

the listed F–value, in the 95% confidence level.

The relationship between the independent and dependent variables is illustrated in a 

three–dimensional representation of the response surfaces (Figs. 3 – 4) and two–dimensional 

contour plots (Fig. 5), as generated by the models presented in Eqs. (19) and (20).

flow rate (D) using the statistical model presented in Eq. 

(19). 

Figure 4. Response surface plot for the distillate yield 
(%D) using the statistical model presented in Eq. (20). 

 

The models described above are valid for the simulated range described in Table 2. 

Analyzing the response functions in Figs. 3 – 4, it can be seen that the overall distillate mass flow 

rate (D) and the distillate yield (%D) were both strongly affected by the molecular distillation 

temperature (EVT). Similarly, at a fixed feed flow rate (Q), increasing the distillation temperature 

represents a times six increase in the effective evaporation rate and distillate mass flow rate with 

respect to the initial value. Therefore, the EVT must be maintained at the highest levels tested. In 

addition, the assumption related to the high values of Q was confirmed, since the residence time 

of the molecules on the evaporator surface was low, and the effective evaporation rate not have 

been enough to evaporate the molecules.  

In order to define the shape of the response surfaces, a canonical analysis must be 

carried out to describe the type of the second order surfaces, the location of the optimum value 

and the canonical direction. 

Analyzing Figs. 5, the contour lines are perpendicular to the EVT axis, indicating 

relatively little change in the distillate mass flow rate (D) with variation in the feed flow rate (Q), 

but relatively large shifts in the same variable (D) with changes in EVT. However, the 

relationship between EVT and Q provides a rising ridge response surface as presented in Fig. 5. 



236 

 

Figure 5. Overlapped contour plots of the distillate mass flow rate (D) and the distillate yield (%D). 

 

No maximum was indicated within the experimental region, but there is a ridge of high 

values starting at about 495 K and 3.0 kg·h-1 and rising with increasing EVT and Q, and a steep 

inclination in D moving from low EVT values (420 K) and low values for Q (1.5 kg·h-1) towards 

the central point of the experimental factorial design. 

On the basis of these results, it is reasonable to assume that the input variables indicating 

the maximum distillate mass flow rate may only be a local maximum on a rising ridge, 

particularly in the case of EVT, where it is assumed that higher EVT values would give higher 

distillate mass flow rates (D). However, since the stationary point lies outside the region, it would 

be difficult to define an optimal point, but it is possible to define a good region to obtain good 

performance of the centrifugal molecular distillation process (48). 

On the other hand, the response surface obtained with Eq. (20) showed a saddle point, at 

which the two variables, EVT and Q, must be analyzed from two perpendicular directions. For 

one of these, each vertical slice of the surface shows a maximum value, and for the other, a 

minimum (see Fig. 5). 

A general canonical analysis allowed one to explore and exploit the fitted quadratic 

response surface, indicating that the predicted response surface would be shaped like a saddle, 

since the eigenvalues were positive (?1=1.678x10
-3) and negative (?2=-1.232). Similarly, since 



237 

one of the eigenvalues is close to zero (?1), then the response surface has one or more ridges 

(49). Thus, the eigenvalue of 1.678x10-3 presented a valley that was less curved than the hill 

orientation. Hence, the coefficients of the associated eigenvectors showed that the valley was 

more aligned with Q and the hill with EVT, as depicted in Fig. 5. 

In order to facilitate a straightforward examination of the distillate mass flow rate (D) 

and the distillate yield (%D) generated by varying the evaporator temperature (EVT) and the feed 

flow rate (Q), the contour plots, constructed using Eqs. (19) – (20), respectively, were overlapped 

(see Fig. 5).  

Analyzing the contour plot related to D, the maximum values of this variable can be 

seen in the ranges from 520 – 610 K and 2.0 – 4.5 kg·h-1. The vertical oval shape in the 

maximum region suggests that the effect of Q on D is less predominant than that of EVT. In 

contrast, both variables, EVT and Q, show their main effect on %D in the maximum region, 

ranging from 540 – 600 K and 1.5 – 3.5 kg·h-1. Consequently, the maximum values for D and 

%D can be obtained in the region delimited by the EVT range from 540 to 600 K and Q range 

from 1.5 to 3.5 kg·h-1. 

4.3.     Physicochemical characterization of split products 

In Fig. 6 are shown the rheograms of the distillate and residue streams obtained from 

CMD.

ATR–W 673.15 K+. 

 



238 

The behavior of distillate and residue streams in rheological experiments conducted at 

constant temperature and pressure has the following features: (i) the shear viscosity does not vary 

with shear rate; (ii) the dynamic viscosity (µ) is constant with respect to the time of shearing; and 

(iii) the stress in studied samples falls to zero (?=0.000 Pa) immediately the shearing ? is equal to 

zero (?=0.000 s–1). Therefore, with constant pressure and temperature (test temperature), distillate 

and residue streams exhibit a Newtonian behavior. 

The plots of ? versus ?  depicted straight lines, where the slope allows to calculate the 

dynamic viscosity at test temperature (µT). Table 7 presents the µ values of distillate and residue 

streams at different operating conditions. Good straight line fits was determined since the linear 

squares correlation varied between 0.9998 and 1.0000. 

Dynamic viscosity (µ) is the quantity that describes a fluid of resistance to flow.  A high 

dynamic viscosity (µ) means that the liquid fluid will not flow easily and vice versa.  The 

viscosity values versus shear rate for the residue streams from CMD process displayed a 

Newtonian behavior in the range of the shear rates and temperature examined at 423.15 K as 

presented in Table 7. Hence, it is possible to affirm that residue streams are constituted by higher 

carbon number chains with high viscosity and polarity related to the presence of complex 

compounds such as resins and asphaltenes (50) when compared to distillate streams which exhibit 

a Newtonian behavior at a lower temperature (372.15 K) than residue streams. 

Table 7 also reports the density at 293.15 K, specific gravity, relative density and API 

gravity of the distillate and residue streams obtained by CMD. Furthermore, it is possible to 

confirm that the processing of ATR–W 673.15 K+ by CMD allows producing products (distillate 

streams) with a remarkable difference regarding to initial sample. Hence, the CMD process 

represents a gain regarding to the decreased of the gravity and the increases of API gravity values 

of the distillate streams reporting fractions with API gravity higher than 16.

240 

In this sense, the density values in distillate streams are lower than values of this 

property in the original sample (ATR–W 673.15 K+) and residue streams, which satisfy the 

objective of the CMD process since it is a function of the difference in molar mass of the mixture 

(the larger the difference in molar mass, the separation will be greater) and depletion of the 

volatile compounds as the temperature of the film surface increases (51). Nevertheless, the rise of 

the density in residue streams is due to the components bearing higher structural complexity are 

concentrated as the evaporator temperature (EVT) rises. Therefore, it is expected that the heaviest 

molecules with greater intermolecular forces and which did not reach the condenser surface are 

routed to the residue stream.  

4.4.     Colloidal characterization: Molar mass distribution 

Figs. 7 – 8 present the SEC profiles of the ATR–W 673.15 K+ and the materials obtained 

from the CMD process carried out in an EVT range from 423.15 K to 603.15 K and Q from 1.473 

kg·h-1 to 4.418 kg·h-1 The profiles were normalized between 0 – 100% for the UV signals (mV) 

to permit comparison of the retention volume segments of the curves. 

The distillate streams obtained from the CMD process were analyzed using the SEC 

method to determine the molar mass distribution of the products (Table 7). It was observed that 

the molar mass distribution of the liquids varied within a wide range. The number average (Mn) 

of the liquid products ranged between 170 kg·kmol-1 and 337 kg·kmol-1 while the weight average 

(Mw) ranged between 192 kg·kmol-1 and 308 kg·kmol-1. Table 7 also shows the polydispersity 

index (PDI), which reflects the deviations of the molar mass distribution from the Gaussian 

distribution of an ideal single compound (52).  

The polydispersity values (between 1.13 – 1.40) for the distillate streams indicated the 

presence of a broader range of low carbon number compounds in these streams. Hence, there was 

a considerable variation in the molar mass of the liquids with increases in the EVT and Q, under 

the conditions investigated. 

On the other hand, the residue products obtained from the CMD process were found to 

have values for Mn and Mw ranging from 376 kg·kmol-1 to 2733 kg·kmol-1 and from 2537 

kg·kmol-1 to 3146 kg·kmol-1, respectively. Furthermore, Table 7 presented that the PDI values 

exhibited a wide range, which means that the number and weight average molar masses (Mn and 



241 

Mw) of these products were not similar in nature to those of the distillate products, suggesting 

that the compounds in the residue streams were very different and containing high carbon number 

chains as resins and asphaltenes.

242 

In this sense, the results presented in Table 7 showed that as evaporator temperature 

(EVT) increases the residue streams exhibited higher values of molar mass than distillate streams 

since there is higher concentration of non–volatile compounds and a high fraction of compounds 

with structural complexity. 

4.4.     Analysis of the performance of the centrifugal molecular distillation by 

simulation 

In this section the numerical results will be presented plus a comparison with the 

experimental data obtained from the CMD process used to split a heavy petroleum fractions. The 

modeling and simulation are illustrated for a heavy residue (ATR–W 673.15 K+) divided into 

twenty five pseudocomponents. The physicochemical properties (basic and thermodynamic 

properties) were estimated using correlations available in the literature as presented by Tovar et 

al. (34). The thermophysical properties (kinematic viscosity, thermal conductivity, specific heat 

capacity, evaporation enthalpy, vapor pressure and diffusion coefficient) were estimated as a 

function of the normal boiling point, specific gravity and temperature (surface temperature of the 

film), as presented by Tovar et al. (34). 

The equipment dimensions and operating conditions are listed in Table 8.

Numerical results of surface temperature (Ts), effective evaporation rate (GE), distillate 

mass flow rate (D) and liquid film thickness (?) profiles have been analyzed from simulated data 

obtained with the computational environment through  the mathematical model developed by 

Inuzuka et al. (36) and modified, using the effective evaporation rate. Therefore, it was adopted 

for discussing the effect of operating condition (EVT and Q) on output variables. Typical results 

from these computed profiles are presented in Figs. 9 – 12.

4.4.1. Evaporator temperature influence on centrifugal molecular distillation 

The EVT is the most important governing condition in the evaporating flow. In Fig. 9, 

the Ts profiles of the liquid film are shown as a function of the radial distance, RD, along of the 

evaporator surface. Hence, when a thin liquid film of a multicomponents flows over a heated 

evaporator surface, under vacuum conditions (i.e. 0.4 Pa), evaporation phenomenon at the free 



245 

surface, leads to depletion of the most volatile component or components in the liquid phase, 

forming a thin liquid film that, evenly, might to condense along the condenser surface. As a 

result, the distillate flow increases as consequence of: (i) The elevated film surface temperature; 

(ii) the decrease of the film thickness on the evaporator surface and, (iii) advantageous operating 

conditions on the centrifugal molecular distillation process. 

Furthermore, results showed that the radial thermal gradients inner the thin liquid film 

produced a significantly change in the GE and D. Figs. 10 – 11 showed that the GE and D varied 

strongly after the center of evaporator surface, representing how fast the front of liquid film flow 

advances along the evaporator surface and how the fluid flow changes into the vapor state over 

the evaporator surface, which means that the GE profiles are greatly influenced by EVT, the 

concept of relaxation length was applied for understand the effect on this output variable.  

On the other hand, the relaxation length concept refers to the radial position at which a 

given parameter (Ts and GE) reaches asymptotic value (15). Therefore, in reference to the GE, the 

upper limits were 10.4555 kg·m-2·s-1 (trial 1 and trial 2 at 0.2662 m), 40.005 kg·m-2·s-1 (trial 3 at 

0.2541 m), 19.601 kg·m-2·s-1 (trial 4 at 0.2119 m), 40.358 kg·m-2·s-1 (trial 6 at 0.1938 m), 19.129 

kg·m-2·s-1, 12.538 kg·m-2·s-1 and 16.842 kg·m-2·s-1 (trial 7, trial 8 and trial 9 at 0.2662 m). With 

respect to the heat transfer, two regions can be elucidated: (i) the temperature profile in the 

entrance section of conical evaporator surface from 0.03095 m to 0.1800 m and, (ii) a fully 

developed Ts profile from 0.1500 m to 0.2662 m. thus, in the first section, evaporation of liquid 

was negligible in comparison with the section between 0.180 m and 0.2662 m. In consequence, 

the efficiency of the CMD process increased along the RD, resulting in the correspondingly 

exponential increase of the distillate mass flow rate, D, due to the increase of the induced 

centrifugal force, which is known as the flow driving force in the system (Fig. 11). 

In Fig. 12 is presented the ? profile for different values of EVT at range from 423.15 K 

to 603.15 K and Q from 1.473 kg·h-1 to 4.418 kg·h-1. The radial distance, RD, is plotted on the 

abscissa and the film thickness, ?, on the ordinate. It can be seen that the greatest changes in the 

film thickness profile occurred in the region between 0.03095 m to 0.1800 m corresponding to 

the entrance section of the feed material and center section of the evaporator surface. Analyzing 

the film thickness profiles it was depicted a continuous decrease to 1x10-3 m at 603.15 K and 

2.945 kg·h-1. This is explained by depletion of the volatile pseudocomponents due to the increase 



246 

in the temperature of the film surface (Ts), the lower viscosity and the higher effective 

evaporation rates of the evaporating molecules as presented by Zuñiga–Liñan et al. (10). 

4.3.2.     Feed flow rate influence on centrifugal molecular distillation 

In order to provide a qualitative and quantitative physical insight inner the evaporating 

liquid film over the evaporator surface device, it was extensively performed the study on the flow 

behavior in terms of the Ts, GE, D and ?, analyzing the influence of Q. 

In Figs. 9 – 12 the relationship of the Ts, GE, D and ?  versus RD are shown with EVT 

and Q as parameter. Thus, the Ts profiles increase gradually throughout the film length and reach 

the asymptotic values in correspondence with the relaxation length of 0.1800 m.  In the studied 

range of Q, the temperature difference in the radial direction was very small (0.05 K·m-1). These 

relatively small radial gradients might be ascribed to the low thermal conductivity, about 1.22 

W·m-1·K-1 for ATR–W 673.15 K+, to conduct heat transferred from the evaporator surface to the 

inner of the liquid film.  

The slight rise of the Ts (Fig. 9) and the GE (Fig. 10) profiles as Q decrease is related 

mainly to the good mass transfer over the evaporator surface and, consequently, to the increase of 

evaporation of volatile compounds.  In addition, at fixed temperature (i.e. 577.15 K), the liquid 

film at lower Q values had higher asymptotic profile of GE and higher relaxation lengths per film 

thickness unit as along radial distance (RD) when compared to high values of Q. Therefore, Q 

parameter influenced directly in the liquid film thickness and mass transfer, once, values of Q 

lower than 1.000 kg·h-1 may not be high enough to efficient mass and heat transfers. On the other 

hand, for Q values higher than 2.000 kg·h-1, the system might operate with low effectiveness 

because the residence time of the molecules on the evaporator might be too low.  

Fig. 12 shows the development of the ? along the evaporator length in r–direction. 

Given the dependence on the ?  in relationship with the Q, the ? profiles were affected by the 

change of Q condition. Thus, it is noted that lower ?  values were reached at the low values of Q, 

guarantying in this conditions, that a uniform thin film promotes high efficiency in the mass and 

in the energy transfers. This engages to the fact that the evaporation speed increases when the 

liquid film over the evaporator surface becomes more uniform at lower values of Q ensuring the 



247 

short residence time of the liquid load over the evaporator surface and the distributing in the form 

of a thin liquid film. 

4.3.3.     Model validity 

The results obtained of distillate mass flow rate (D) and distillate yield (%D) in the 

simulations and the response surface analyses, were compared with the experimental data as 

presented in Table 9. Moreover, results were evaluated in terms of the average absolute deviation 

percent (AAD%) defined as the absolute deviation percent in estimating a quantity divided by its 

observed value (yref).The absolute deviation percent is defined as the difference among the 

observed values (yref) and the response predicted (ycal) by the modeling approach at each 

operating condition (Table 9). Consequently, the mathematical and statistical models from Eqs. 

(19) – (20) gave a good representation of the experimental data related to the overall distillate 

mass flow rate (D) since, the average absolute deviation (AAD%) were of 12.14% (mathematical 

model), 14.16% (statistical model from Eq. 19) and; distillate yield (%D)  since AAD% was 

4.58% (statistical model form Eq. 20), respectively.

On the other hand, as can be seen, the predicted values with the statistical models (Eqs. 

19 – 20) match the experimental values reasonably well with a percent of maximum explainable

model. It shows that the distribution of the residual for the response approximately follows the 

fitted normal distribution and the residuals of the response randomly scatter in the residual plots.

Conclusions 

Response surface methodology was used in conjunction with central composite factorial 

design to optimize the operating conditions of the centrifugal molecular distillation from a high–

boiling–point petroleum fraction (ATR–W 673.15 K+). The central composite factorial design 

technique was shown to be very useful for the analysis of the significant effects on the overall 

distillate mass flow rate (D) and the distillate yield (%D) in the centrifugal molecular distillation 

process. The analysis of variance revealed that the main effects of the evaporator temperature 

(EVT) and the feed flow rate (Q) were the most significant factors that influenced the dependent 

variable distillate mass flow rate (D), followed by the quadratic effect of evaporator temperature, 

while the most significant factors that influenced the distillate yield (%D) were the main effects 

of the evaporator temperature (EVT) and the feed flow rate (Q), followed by the quadratic effects 

of both operating variables (EVT and Q) and the two–level interaction effect of evaporator 

temperature (EVT) and feed flow rate (Q).  

Regression equations (statistical models from Eqs. 19 – 20) were derived for both the 

distillate mass flow rate (D) and distillate yield (%D), predicting values in good agreement with 

experimental values. Therefore, statistical models can be used to predict within the range of 

evaporator temperature (EVT) and feed flow rate (Q) analyzed in this study. Accordingly, using 

the response surface methodology it was possible to determine the optimal operating conditions 

to obtain a high distillate mass flow rate (D) without a loss of yield in the centrifugal molecular 

distillation process (high values of %D). From the analysis of the response surfaces, the most 

suitable operating conditions to study the processing (split) of heavy petroleum fractions were 

determined. Consequently, maximum values for D and %D can be obtained in the region 

delimited by ranges for EVT from 540 to 600 K and for Q from 1.5 to 3.5 kg·h-1. 

Rheological profiles of the distillate and residue streams obtained by centrifugal 

molecular distillation process revealed a Newtonian behavior at 372.15 K and 423.15 K, 

respectively, since the dynamic viscosity (µ) stayed constant in front of the linear increase of the 

shear stress (?) as function of the shear rate (?). On the other hand, it was clear the increase of 

API gravity data of the distillate streams. This can be explained since the centrifugal molecular 

distillation process produces distillate streams which have a lower proportion of compounds with 



250 

complex molecular structures when compared with residue streams which have compounds with 

features of resins and asphaltenes.  

From the simulated results obtained for the centrifugal molecular distillation processing 

of the heavy residue ATR–W 673.15 K+, it was concluded that the surface temperature, film 

thickness, effective evaporation rate and overall distillate mass flow rate were strongly affected 

by the evaporator temperature (EVT). Thus, the effectiveness of centrifugal molecular distillation 

process from ATR–W 673.15 K+ was evaluated by minimum film thickness, high distillate mass 

flow rate and high effective evaporation rate as consequence of the depletion phenomenon of the 

most volatile compound or compounds (pseudocomponents) and efficient mass and heat transfers 

inner the evaporating liquid film over the evaporator surface device.

6.3.     Considerações finais 

Este capítulo apresentou o sistema de equações diferencias parciais que representa a 

modelagem matemática do processo de destilação molecular de resíduos de petróleo (ATR–W, 

ATR–Y e ATR–Z), em um destilador molecular centrífugo. Essa modelagem baseou–se no 

trabalho apresentado por Inuzuka et al. (1986) introduzindo uma modificação na taxa de 

evaporação e assumindo ela como a taxa de evaporação efetiva levando em conta os efeitos da 

geometria do sistema e o grau de anisotropia do sistema, sendo este uma mistura 

multicomponente.  

Em virtude dos resultados obtidos com a ferramenta computacional que abrange a 

simulação do processo, pôde–se estimar e analisar o comportamento dos perfis das variáveis de 

interesse, que caracterizam o processo (temperatura da superfície do filme, taxa de destilado, taxa 

efetiva, espessura do filme e velocidade de escoamento), através da sensibilidade paramétrica das 

variáveis operacionais: vazão de alimentação, temperatura do evaporador, velocidade do rotor e 

pressão do sistema.  

Resultados da análise de sensibilidade paramétrica apresentaram que as variáveis 

determinantes e características do processo foram: a temperatura na superfície do filme, a taxa de 

evaporação, a taxa de destilado e a espessura do filme. Tais variáveis mostraram–se ser 

fortemente influenciadas pela temperatura da destilação ou temperatura do evaporador. Quando a 

temperatura da superfície do filme aumenta, o filme sofre uma diminuição na concentração dos 

componentes (pseudo–componentes) mais voláteis. Em consequência, o perfil da espessura do 

filme se apresenta como uma queda exponencial onde esse diminui com maior velocidade na 

região a qual apresenta a maior taxa de aumento da temperatura da superfície do filme.  

Todos os desempenhos das variáveis estudadas e analisadas neste capítulo descrevem as

taxas de evaporação e as altas taxas do destilado, satisfazendo, com isso, os princípios do 

processo referentes a um menor tempo de exposição do material às condições da temperatura de

Aplicação da calorimetria exploratória 

diferencial no estudo da cinética de 

craqueamento em presença de catalisador 

de frações pesadas de petróleo  
 

7.1.     Introdução 

 Em geral, o início do processo de destilação molecular reativa é detectado pela presença 

de cadeias carbônicas menores, pela redução na massa molar e pela diminuição na viscosidade, 

sendo esta última, provocada pela cisão das ligações da cadeia carbônica ou pela perda de grupos 

laterais, o que gera a formação de radicais livres, que causam uma instabilidade ou craqueamento 

das moléculas. Por sua vez, a redução na massa molar da fração de petróleo, provocada pelo 

craqueamento catalítico, por menor que sejam seus efeitos, acarretará uma alteração na 

conformação estrutural das cadeias de carbono nas frações de petróleo.  

Estudos cinéticos envolvendo craqueamento de cargas industriais em um processo 

catalítico (craqueamento catalítico fluidizado e/ou hidroprocessamento) são complexos, e 

depende tanto da distribuição dos diversos compostos presentes, quanto dos níveis de conversão 

desejados. 

Adotando–se um modelo, baseado na Lei de Potência, para a cinética de craqueamento 

aparente, a expressão da taxa de reação (

Assim, nesse trabalho, a calorimetria exploratória diferencial, do inglês DSC 

(Differential scanning calorimetry) foi usada com o objetivo de verificar as transições físico–



260 

químicas que aconteceram no processo de craqueamento das frações de petróleo (resíduos 

atmosféricos ATR–W e ATR–Z). Portanto, esse estudo objetivou analisar a cinética do processo 

de craqueamento das frações pesadas do petróleo, permitindo, assim, que fosse avaliada a 

influência da quantidade de catalisador (3, 5 e 10% m/m) durante o processo. Da mesma forma, o 

estudo cinético não–isotérmico utilizando o método isoconversional de Flynn–Wall–Ozawa, 

permitiu determinar os parâmetros cinéticos para diferentes frações de massa, sendo capaz de 

determinar a energia de ativação sem conhecimento prévio do modelo de reação e permitindo 

avaliar os efeitos de compensação cinética.

Kinetic study on catalytic cracking of Brazilian high–boiling–point petroleum 

fractions 

Abstract 

This work proposed a technique to estimate the kinetic parameters of cracking reaction. 

High–boiling–point petroleum fractions (&gt;623.15 K) were analyzed. The experiments were 

performed using a thermal analysis system with a differential scanning calorimetry module at 

different linear heating rates (15, 20, 25 and 30 K min
-1

) in the temperature range from 303.15 to 

823.15 K. The Arrhenius, Kissinger and Flynn–Ozawa–Wall methods were used to determine the 

kinetic parameters. The compensation effect and the dependence on the activation energy of the 

conversion degree were evaluated. The catalyst used was a typical FCC regenerated catalyst 

containing  48.3 % mass of alumina, and particle size of 67µm. The effect of catalyst loading was 

studied using 3, 5 and 10 % mass.  Analysis of the DSC curves showed a major transitional stage 

between 693.15 and 723.15 K, identified as an endothermic region of high temperature oxidation 

(HTO).  Empirical kinetic models were produced and data were obtained from the kinetic 

analysis of the HTO region. Under non–isothermal heating conditions higher activation energies 

were found as the API gravity of the high–boiling–point petroleum fraction decreased. On the 

other hand, the results showed consistent effects for the dependence of the activation energy on 

the extent of cracking conversion under non–isothermal conditions, showing a decrease with the 

extent of conversion. The catalytic loading effect is remarkable, and provides an alternative route 

for the cracking with lower activation energy with increasing catalyst weight. The kinetic 

parameters formulated will be used in the mathematical modeling of the reactive molecular 

distillation process for upgrading high–boiling–point petroleum fractions. 

 Keywords: Reactive molecular distillation, high–boiling–point petroleum fractions, 

cracking reaction, catalyst loading, differential scanning calorimetry data, kinetic model.

1.        Introduction 

High–boiling–point petroleum fractions (&gt;623.15 K) or heavy petroleum fractions and 

heavy crude oil include atmospheric and vacuum petroleum residues, coal oil extracts and crude 

oils extracted from tar sands [1]. They are referred to as "heavy" because their specific gravities 

are higher than those of light petroleum fractions or light crude oils, which means that the 

production, transportation and refining operations of these materials present greater challenges 

than those of light petroleum fractions or light crude oils [2]. 

The reactive molecular distillation (RMD) process, involving the coupling of molecular 

distillation (high vacuum separation process) with conversion (reactive process), can be described 

as an upgraded intensified process for the processing of high–boiling–point petroleum fractions, 

developed by the Separation Process Development Laboratory (LDPS) and the Optimization, 

Project and Advanced Control Laboratory (LOPCA) of the Chemical Engineering School of 

UNICAMP, sponsored by the Research Center of Petrobras–Brazil (CENPES/Petrobras) and 

Brazilian Study and Project Financing Institution (FINEP). The particular characteristics of RMD 

configuration (conversion–split) are: (i) the implementation of high vacuum; (ii) the material is 



 

263 

processed above the appropriate temperatures; (iii) the use of short time residence; and (iv) good 

contact between the sample and the catalyst surface. These factors provide a high effective 

evaporation rate, high kinetic reaction and, consequently, high rates of conversion–split. 

The introduction of an in situ reaction (cracking) in the separation process zone 

(between separator and condenser) or vice versa, leads to known interactions between the mass 

transfer rates, diffusion and chemical kinetics. Reactive molecular distillation (RMD) is a 

combination of reaction (cracking) and molecular distillation (high vacuum) in a single operation, 

which enjoys specific advantages over the conventional sequential approach of reaction followed 

by separation process, with effective use of reaction heat and transformation of ultra–heavy and 

heavy oil into lighter oil, ensuring better flow and processing. It allows the material to be 

submitted to adequate temperatures to provide a high reaction rate and short exposure time of the 

material, allowing a controlled reaction, and even, providing an alternative for difficult 

separations (Fig. 1).

The eqs. (1) – (4) show the model that described the RMD process in a liquid 

evaporating film. Under steady–state conditions, a one–dimensional mathematical model and a 

number of assumptions (laminar flow, very thin liquid film thickness, negligible normal and 

tangential velocity components as compared to the radial component), liquid film processes can 

be studied in the evaporator system, including fundamental equations for film flow, equations for 

diffusion and the governing equation for mass, continuity and energy balance. A sketch of the 

coordinate system is presented in Fig. 2.

Each governing equation is the avowal of a conservation law, in which entity refers to 

mass, momentum or energy, respectively. The rates of entity production come from the chemical 

reactions in Eq, (4) and from the external force field in Eqs. (1) – (3).  From an observation of the 

reaction term in the RMD model (see Eq. 4), the need for substantial attention in order to expand 

the domain of RMD processes to complex chemical system, i.e. high–boiling–point petroleum 

fractions (&gt;623.15 K), is evident. Thus, the chemical reaction kinetic is an important aspect in the 

context of the RMD process, and consequently the kinetics parameters must be estimated from 

the kinetic approach. 

The cracking reaction of the high–boiling–point petroleum fractions is extremely 

complex, but if appropriate generalizations are made the chemical kinetics can be represented. In 

the present work, a kinetic representation was formulated, adequate to combine with the flow, 

energy and diffusion equations to predict the in–situ reaction in the RMD process of high–

boiling–point petroleum fractions. Non–isothermal kinetic analyses by differential scanning 

calorimetry (DSC) were performed in order to understand and study the transitional stage 

identified as cracking reactions in the endothermic region of high temperature oxidation (HTO).  

1.1.     Kinetic model approach for the cracking reaction 

In the present work, catalytic cracking denotes the transition of a complex substance in 

presence of catalyst, where high–boiling–point petroleum fractions are converted into better 

quality products, that is, petroleum molecules are broken into shorter molecules to extract low–

boiling fractions with reduced molar mass [4, 5]. Ebrahimi et al. [6] and Gupta [7] developed a 



266 

model based on the pseudocomponent approach. It is assumed that when one mole of a 

pseudocomponent cracked gives one mole each of two other pseudocomponents and some 

amount of coke may also form as described in Eq. (6). 

( ), ," , , , ,

Where i, m, and n are pseudocomponents numbers, ?i,m,n is the amount of coke formed  

when a ith pseudocomponent (NPSEi) cracks to produces mth and nth pseudocomponents 

(NPSEm and NPSEn). Therefore, the intensive kinetics for the cracking reaction can be written as 

the rate of the kinetic process, as follows:

Furthermore, the dependence of the reaction rate on temperature is manifested by the 

temperature dependence of the rate constant (k”) according to the Arrhenius equation as follows:

(8) 

Where, ? is the conversion degree, E the activation energy of the reaction, R the gas

2.        Theoretical background 

Kinetic parameters have been determined by isothermal and dynamic experiments using 

thermal analytical methods such as thermogravimetry/derivate thermogravimetry (TG/DTG) and 

differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Kök and Keskin [8] investigated the thermal 

characteristics and combustion kinetics of three crude oils (13 – 27 °API) using DSC and 

TG/DTG, identifying three reaction regions as low temperature oxidation (LTO), fuel deposition 

(FD) and high temperature oxidation (HTO) using a first order kinetic model. Kök [9] determined 

the combustion kinetics of light crude oils with and without FeCl3 solution as catalyst (1 – 1.5 % 

mol/mol), using TG/DTA. The activation energy was shown to be between 59.8 and 49.8 kJ mol
-1

 

with 1 – 1.5 % mol/mol of catalyst. When the experiments were carried out without the catalyst, 

the activation energy was 94.7 kJ mol
-1

.  

Other researchers applied thermal analyses (DSC and TG) to medium and heavy 

petroleum fractions (with high asphaltene contents) [10] and distillation residues [11], in order to 



 

267 

characterize the thermal behavior, and the endothermic behavior and melting temperature of the 

asphaltenes. Recently, Sánchez–Jiménez et al. [12] applied the methodology in the thermal 

analysis using the dynamic heating rate to carry out a study with the Kissinger method to 

determine the kinetic parameters. The apparent kinetic study carried out by  Guo et al. [13]  using 

thermogravimetry (TG), showed that during the thermal cracking/coking of Jinzhou residue and 

its fractions, the cracking reaction followed a first order reaction in two different temperature 

zones with activation energies of 75–120 kJ mol
?1

 and 130–210 kJ mol
?1

. On the other hand, 

Silva et al. [14] used TG/DTG techniques to study the catalytic degradation of heavy oil (15.4 

°API) over silica–based MCM–41 mesoporous molecular sieve, determining the activation 

energy for oil degradation decreased from 128 to 69 kJ mol
-1

 for PET/MCM–41applying the 

kinetic method of Vyazovkin. Furthermore, Kök and Gundogar [15] studied non–isothermal 

combustion and kinetic analysis of crude oil in limestone matrix was studied with different clay 

concentrations by thermogravimetry (TG/DTG). In TG/DTG experiments, three distinct reaction 

regions were identified in all of the crude oil + limestone mixture known as low temperature 

oxidation (LTO), fuel deposition (FD) and high temperature oxidation (HTO) respectively. 

Discussions about reaction kinetics focus on the reaction model, since it is independent 

of the heating rate, but the activation energy is dependent on the conversion were presented by 

Aç?kal?n [16]. Considering the kinetic compensation effects (KCEs) due to differences in the 

physicochemical properties of the samples under the experimental conditions, different methods 

have been used to analyze the experimental kinetic data [17]. The occurrence of the KCEs and 

the E–dependence on ? can generate large deviations in the prediction of the reaction rate. Hence, 

researchers have carried out experimental work under non–isothermal and isothermal conditions 

to evaluate the E–dependence on ? of diverse feedstock.  The existence of the KCEs has been 

presented in published literature for several researchers of heterogeneous reactions [18]. Joraid 

[19] and, Vyazovkin and Sbirrazzuoli [20] evaluated the E–dependence for non–isothermal 

crystallization. The first researcher analyzed two regions (between 471.15 – 479.15 K and 481.15 

– 491.15 K) and attributed the E–dependence to changes in the crystallization kinetics as the 

polymer melted; and the second group of researchers presented the variation in activation energy 

(from 128.7 to 77.8 kJ mol
-1

) as a consequence of sample morphology. 

In this work, cracking reaction of two different high–boiling–point petroleum fractions 

were investigated in order to obtain the overall kinetic parameters (activation energy (E) and 



268 

frequency factor (A)). In order to study the kinetic compensation effects (KCE) and activation 

energy dependence on the degree of conversion, the Flynn–Ozawa–Wall (FWO) method was 

used. The procedure was applied to two high–boiling–point petroleum fractions (atmospheric 

distillation residues –ATRs) from crude oil with different API gravities (between 12 – 25 °API).  

2.1.     Methods for the derivation of kinetic parameters 

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) provides both qualitative and quantitative 

information about material transitions (reactions). Most published kinetic methods using DSC 

data are based on the enthalpy change, where the gradient dH

 is directly proportional to the 

reaction rate d
dt

? , as shown in Eq. (9) [21].

(9) 

Thus the application of calorimetry techniques has been used to obtain complete 

qualitative and quantitative information about the cracking reaction for high–boiling–point 

petroleum fractions, determining the reaction order (n), activation energy (E), frequency factor 

(A), conversion degree (?) and rate constants at different temperatures. 

2.1.1.     Kissinger Method 

The kinetic parameters determined by the Kissinger method are based on the study of 

the rate equation at the maximum reaction rate, which means that

2.1.2.     Maximum rate model: Arrhenius model 

This approach assumes Arrhenius behavior and first–order reaction kinetics, and is 

based on the maximum rate of heat absorption during the analysis at constant heating rates (see 

Eq. 12).

A plot of ( )1ln ? ?  versus mT provides the information required to calculate the activation 

energy (E) from the slope, and the pre–exponential factor (A) from the intercept of the straight 

[23]. 

2.1.3.     Kinetic compensation effect (KCE) 

The kinetic compensation effect (KCE) suggests that the pre–exponential factor A varies 

with the activation energy E according to Eq. (13) [24, 25]: 

* *
ln A a E b= +  (13) 

Where a
*
 and b

*
 are constant coefficients and act as compensation parameters. 

The evaluation of the activation E–dependence on ? is based on the following 

assumptions: 

The activation energy (E) and pre–exponential factor (A) do not depend on the heating 

rate (?) and are correlated by Eq. (13). 

The kinetic compensation effects are evaluated in the following range of conversion 

degrees 0.2&lt;?&lt;0.9 to lessen the effects of transition. 

The E–dependence on ? is given as: 

( )0 1 1E E E ?= +  (14) 

Where E0 and E1 are constants. 



270 

An approximate differential method for determining the E–dependence on ? is based on 

the method developed by Flynn–Ozawa–Wall (FWO) (see Eq. 15), based on the fact that to 

evaluate the kinetic parameters it is not necessary to know the reaction order or the conversional 

function F(?) [26, 27]. 

( ) ( ) ( )ln ln ln 5.3305 1.0516 EEAF R RT? ?= ? ? ?  
(15) 

Where F(?) is the conversion functional relationship; A is the pre–exponential factor; E 

is the activation energy; R is the general gas constant; ? is the heating rate and T is the absolute 

temperature. 

Reorganizing Eq. (15), the activation energy of the cracking reaction can be obtained 

from multiple constant heating based on Eq. (16): 

( )ln 1.0516 ln ln 5.3305

(16) 

Considering that the mechanism of cracking is independent of the heating rate, F(a) is 

constant for the iso–conversional case, the plot of ln ? versus T
-1

, obtained from the curves 

recorded during multiple constant heating, should be a straight line whose slope can be used to 

evaluate the activation energy (approximately -1.0516E/R). 

In order to determine the reaction order (n) and pre–exponential factor (A), the Avrami’s 

theory has been used, extended to describe non–isothermal cases (see Eq. 17) [28].

Hence, a plot of ( )ln ln 1 ??? ? ?? ?  versus ln ?  provided some straight lines, of which the

?  , it was 

possible to determine the pre–exponential factor value since E was evaluated using the FWO 

method for every value of ?. Thus the values for ln A corresponding to various values for E and ? 

were obtained. Finally, the plotting of ln A versus E should be linear as required by the existence 

of the KCEs (see Eq. 13).

3.        Experimental procedure  

3.1.     Samples 

For the cracking reaction study, Brazilian crude oils with different API gravities (12 – 25 

°API) from several sources were distilled by conventional atmospheric distillation [29], resulting 

in two atmospheric distillation residues (ATR–W and ATR–Z). They were supplied by the 

Petrobras Research and Development Center (CENPES–Brazil) and the properties of the high–

boiling–point petroleum fractions are shown in Table 1.

The most promising aspects related to the efficiency of the catalytic RMD process listed 

before are related to accomplishment of operational temperatures and pressures (below 50 Pa), 

depending on the characteristics of the reactants, a lower amount of catalyst and the products 

desired. In this sense, the influence of adding catalyst to the high–boiling–point petroleum 

fractions at 3, 5 and 10 % mass of catalyst was also studied, using the zeolite–based catalyst CR–

1 (regenerated catalyst used for FCC technology), and its primary properties are listed in Table 2.

3.2.     Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements 

Thermal experiments were carried out on the high–boiling–point petroleum fractions 

using a Mettler–Toledo DSC 823e thermal analysis system (Mettler Toledo GmbH, Germany), 

and liquid nitrogen was used for cooling. The DSC module was calibrated with indium with 

indium standard (it had a certified fusion temperature of 156.6 ± 0.3 °C and heat flow calibration 

of 28.45 ± 0.6 J g
?1

). The experiments were carried out with a sample size of ~10 mg. The 

samples were weighed into open aluminum pans, hermetically sealed and then placed in the 

sample chamber of the DSC module. The reference was an identical, empty pan, with an equal 

weight matched within ±0.1 mg. Linear heating rates of 15, 20, 25 and 30 K min
-1

 were used over 

the temperature range from 303.15 to 823.15 K, with a nitrogen flow of 50 mL min
-1

 controlled 

by a gas control system (Mettler–Toledo TS0800GC1). The STARe (V 9.01) software Instrument 

Software was used to provide an estimate of the enthalpy ( H? ) and the heat flow calculated from 

the DSC transition curve. In order to evaluate the repeatability of the measurement, the relative 

standard deviation (%RSD) with respect to the mean signal of each measurement, calculated over 

three (03) consecutive repetitions of Indium standard was examined. The value obtained was 

lower than 8.53%. 

4.        Results and discussion 

The thermal analyses used to estimate the kinetic parameters of the two high–boiling–

point petroleum fractions: ATR–W, and ATR–Z, and their mixtures with added catalyst (3, 5 and 

10 % mass of catalyst) are presented in this work. 

4.1.     Thermal analysis deflection 

The thermal analyses carried out using DSC showed the changes in the properties of the 

high–boiling–point petroleum fractions studied occurring with temperature. In Fig. 3, the heat 

flow rate signal (DSC signal) is internally calculated from the temperature difference between the 

sample material and the reference pan, showing the endothermic region where the cracking 

reaction took place, and thus the changes in heat content and properties of the samples are 

indicated by a peak and/or deflection. Thus the reaction rate, d
d t

? , rises to a maximum value 

when the temperature is increased, while the reaction occurs. The maximum rate occurs at a 

temperature,
m

T , where the peak differential thermal analysis deflection occurs.

In the DSC experiments, one transition region was detected on the curves. This region 

occurred between 693 and 723 K and was called the high temperature oxidation (HTO) region 

where hydrocarbons were fully oxidized by atmosphere surrounding the sample and the presence 

of a catalyst. During the course of this process, hydrocarbons were continuously converted to 

other types of hydrocarbons, which makes the conversion process mainly attributed to cracking 

due to the effect of heat and the catalyst. In this region, complex organic molecules are broken 

down into simple molecules, and as a result, the C–C, C–H and C–heteroatom bonds are broken, 

producing reactive free radicals [30]. 

 

 

 

Figure  3. Curve at non–isothermal heating conditions of: a) ATR–W and b) ATR–Z. 

Under non–isothermal heating conditions, the DSC curves (Fig. 3) gave heat flow rates 

showing that the ATR–W generated greater heat flow than the ATR–Z. As a consequence, as the 

Tm 

Tm 



274 

API gravity decreased, so the heat flow during the transition stage (HTO) increased. However, 

the rise in the heat flow rates is also associated with the amount of asphaltenes in the samples. 

Kök and Karacan [31] explained in their paper that when the asphaltene content in the crude oil 

increased, so the heating value of the cracking reaction increased, and this proposition concords 

with the results obtained in the present work.  

Table 3 shows the dependence of heat production on the heating rate and the maximum 

peak temperatures for the different materials. Using four different heating rates (15, 20, 25 and 30 

K min
–1

), the results demonstrated that all the peaks or deflections shifted towards higher reaction 

temperatures (
m

T ) and heat flows at higher heating rates, even in the presence of the catalyst, as 

summarized in Table 3. However, results indicated that the colloidal composition of high–

boiling–point petroleum fractions, as well as the transferability, impurities around the sample and 

heat transfer characteristics, does not have a pronounced influence on the heat evolved in the 

HTO region.

4.2.     Conversion degree of the reaction 

The quantitative kinetic analysis began with the determination of the conversion–

temperature data determined by the STARe (V 9.01) software linked with the Mettler–Toledo 

DSC 823e thermal analysis system. Hence, when the conversion degree was plotted against the 

temperature, the kinetics was shown to obey sigmoid curves (Figs. 4 and 5). From the 

experiments carried out, it can be seen that although the 
m

T  changed when the heating rate was 

increased, the conversion degree ( ? ) remained nearly the same, as seen in Figs. 4 and 5, for 

ATR–W and ATR–Z, respectively. 



 

275 

In order to study the catalytic effect on the cracking reaction of the high–boiling–point 

petroleum fractions, the effect of adding  3, 5 and 10 % mass of catalyst on the conversion of the 

high–boiling–point petroleum fractions at heating rates of 15, 20, 25 and 30 K min
-1

, was studied.  

 

  

  
 

Figure 4. Conversion degree as a function of temperature and heating rate (15, 10, 25 and 30 K min
-1

) for different 

systems: a) ATR–W+0 % mass of catalyst,  b) ATR–W+3 % mass of catalyst, c) ATR–W+5 % mass of catalyst and 

d) ATR–W+10 % mass of catalyst. 

 

In the ? versus T curves, three zones were identified. The initial region that starts from 

303 K up to 400 K, depending on the high–boiling–petroleum fraction, characterized by a low 

velocity conversion not being bigger than 18%. In the ATR–W and ATR–Z high–boiling–point 

petroleum fractions (Figs. 4a and 5a, respectively), the velocity conversion, in the range 693–723 

K, is bigger than for the rest of the range, which is basically due to the process whereby complex 



276 

organic molecules or hydrocarbons with high molar mass are broken down into simpler 

molecules (hydrocarbons with lower molar mass), by the breaking of C–C bonds in the 

precursors, reaching conversion degree values from 18 to 90%. The third stage of these curves is 

understood at 723 K. In this stage is assumed that the cracking is almost complete since the 

variation of the conversion with temperature is the lowest.  

Then, Figs. 4 and 5 suggest that the cracking reaction is possible in a catalytic process in 

the same three stages, and the rate of cracking and the end products are strongly dependent on the 

temperature and the presence of catalysts.

systems: a) ATR–Z+0 % mass of catalyst, b) ATR–Z+3 % mass of catalyst, c) ATR–Z+5 % mass of catalyst and d) 

ATR–Z+10 % mass of catalyst.

systems: a) ATR–Z+0 % mass of catalyst, b) ATR–Z+3 % mass of catalyst, c) ATR–Z+5 % mass of catalyst and d) 

ATR–Z+10 % mass of catalyst. 

Therefore, in Figs. 4 and 5 the variation of conversion with the temperature, ? versus T, is shown 

for the mixtures with catalyst up to 10% in mass, and three stages are observed as follows: (i) The 

first stage corresponds to the formation of the first radicals, which is a period when the cracking 

reaction velocity is slow and in consequence the conversion degree is low. (ii) In the second 

stage, the free–radical mechanism accelerates to cause scission of hydrocarbon C–C bonds and a 

reduction in molar mass of heavier hydrocarbons compounds. (iii) In the last stage, the reaction 

velocity slows down, since catalyst activity declines. Nevertheless, ? versus T curve at 15 K min
-

1
, in Fig. 5d, had different effects based on the type of curve shift introduced. Hence, for ATR–

Z+10% mass of catalyst case study, the amount of the lost substances at the first stage is rather 

due to the evaporation than to the formation of the first radical. Accordingly, the ? versus T curve 



278 

for ATR–Z+10% mass of catalyst presents two well–defined steps, before and after 400 K, which 

can be easily recognized in the ? versus T curve (Fig. 5d) identified as non–formation of free 

radicals (attributed to the evaporation process) followed by the complete catalytic cracking of 

heavier compounds, respectively. 

4.3.     Overall kinetic parameters of the cracking reaction  

4.3.1.     Arrhenius and Kissinger methods 

The unity models proposed by Arrhenius and Kissinger to calculate the activation 

energy and pre–exponential factor from DSC data at constant heating rates (15, 20, 25 and 30 K 

min
–1

) were studied. The kinetic data were obtained from the HTO region of the DSC curves, 

assuming a first–order cracking reaction for the high–boiling–point petroleum fractions. 

According to this assumption, the plots of ( )1ln ? ?  versus 1mT ?  (Arrhenius model) and 2ln

activation energy. These plots were constructed for the high–boiling–point petroleum fractions of 

different API gravity with the addition of catalyst (at 3, 5 and 10 % mass of catalyst) (Figs. 6 and 

7). 

In the HTO region, higher activation energies were found as the API gravity of the ATR 

samples decreased (Table 4). These values are comparable to the activation energies of 128.3 kJ 

mol
-1

 and 142.3 kJ mol

 calculated for crude Raman (°API=18.7) and Bati Raman (°API=12.9) 

oils, respectively, by Kök [32], using similar methodology.

However, it can be seen that the activation energy calculated for the peak in the HTO 

region was also related to the asphaltene content, because the activation energies of ATR–W was 

significantly higher than that of ATR–Z, which had a low asphaltene content, inhibiting the 



 

279 

cracking process with 5 and 10 % mass of catalyst. The activation energy data calculated were 

statistically analyzed to find the degree of reliability, and the results are presented in Table 4.

Discussions about reaction kinetics tend to be focused on the activation energy 

parameter due to the following: i) the influence of temperature on the reaction rate is mainly 

determined by the activation energy, while the pre–exponential factor has the responsibility of a 

scale parameter; and ii) the pre–exponential factor is calculated from the intercept of the linear 



280 

regression, which could produce a large variation in the value of the pre–exponential factor from 

a small deviation in the value of the intercept [33]. 

Non–isothermal differential scanning calorimetry is often used to determine the 

activation energy of cracking kinetics. Regarding the estimation of the activation energy, it is 

clear that: i) it is a positive value; ii) it depends on the reaction mechanism, and iii) it is 

dependent on the addition of catalyst. The activation energies calculated for the cracking of the 

high–boiling–point petroleum fractions varied over a wide range. Similar results were reported by 

Yang et al. [34] for a Chinese vacuum residue whose activation energy values were between 

82.13 and 149.3 kJ mol
–1

 using a first–order rate.  

Despite the wide range of activation energies, the calculations demonstrated a general 

trend with respect to the API gravity. As the high–boiling–point petroleum fractions got heavier 

(decrease in API gravity) so the cracking activation energy increased. The cracking activation 

energy also showed a general trend with respect to asphaltene content. Thus, as the API gravity 

of the high–boiling–point petroleum fractions decreased and the asphaltene content increased, so 

the activation energy showed an increment. 

4.3.2.     Aspects of the kinetic compensation effects analysis 

The kinetic representation for the cracking reaction, used to establish the DSC curves for 

the ATR–W+% mass catalyst and ATR–Z+% mass catalyst samples, were recorded at four 

different heating rates (15, 20 ,25 and 30 K min
-1

) in the temperature range studied, applying the 

FWO method. The Figs. 8 – 9 shows the estimates for the activation energy, determined using the 

FWO method, for the whole set of ? values used in the linear plot. The slope of the lines changes 

with increasing conversion degree because the side reaction becomes more important. Table 5 

gives an overview of the values obtained for the E of the cracking reaction, calculated between 

0.2&lt;?&amp;lt;0.9 from the slopes of the straight lines in Figs. 8 and  9.

energy (E) (Table 5). The coefficient of determination (R

? versus –T

 had a value higher than 0.92. According to these results, the value for E decreased 

from 214.71 kJ mol

On the other hand, analyzing the kinetic function, E=E(?),  for ATR–Z case study, it 

was possible to report a decreases from 134.39 kJ mol

According to the FWO method, corresponding to various degrees in the range 0.2&amp;lt;? 

&lt;0.9, Table 5 shows the values of ln A for different values of ?. Considering that the E–

dependence on ? described by Eq. (14), the values for E0 and E1 were found (Table 6). The linear 

E–dependence on 1/? is justified by the results shown in Table 5, where the values calculated 

using Eq. (14) presented a deviation below 0.28. From the intercept of the linear regression 

according to Eq. (13), the values of ln A for each value of E were obtained (Table 6). The 



284 

coefficient of determination (R
2
) corresponding to the straight line of ln A versus E had a value 

higher than 0.98. The Fig. 10 shows the straight lines corresponding to the compensation effect 

for the ATR–W and ATR–Z with catalyst. The linearity observed for several ln A and E values 

indicated that the proposed kinetic representation might be used to evaluate the cracking reaction 

of the ATR–W+% mass catalyst samples, with the compensation parameters a

In this sense, this paper described a methodology for the modeling reaction term 

involved in the diffusion equation for the set of governing equations in the RMD modeling, to 

describe the kinetic schemes for the in–situ reaction of high–boiling–point petroleum fractions. 



 

285 

Various methods (Arrhenius, Kissinger and Flynn–Ozawa–Wall) have been developed for 

determining the kinetic parameters (E, A and f(?)). These methods allow one to obtain the 

dependence of the activation energy (E–dependence) on the conversion degree (?) by means of a 

function E=E(?) and the change of activation energy, E, compensated by the same change in 

temperature or in the logarithm of the pre–exponential factor. 

Conclusions 

This work provided information about the cracking behavior of two high–boiling–point 

petroleum fractions from Brazilian crude oils and the effect of adding a catalyst on the kinetic 

reaction. Three methods were used to calculate the kinetic parameter (activation energy, pre–

exponential factor and reaction rate), from the DSC data analyses obtained with the non–

isothermal method (linear heating rate). The study showed that the cracking rates of the high–

boiling–point petroleum fractions were temperature dependent between 693.15 and 723.15 K, 

and an endothermic region of high temperature oxidation (HTO) was identified. 

In the methods studied, the kinetic parameters were determined from the slope and 

intercept, respectively, of the linear regression equation. Both the Arrhenius and Kissinger 

equations allowed for the simultaneous determination of the activation energy and pre–

exponential factor for several increasing linear temperature experiments.  On the other hand, the 

cracking of the samples studied can be considered as a first–order reaction for the kinetic term in 

the reactive molecular distillation modeling. The kinetic parameters of the high–boiling–point 

petroleum fractions samples showed that higher activation energy values were obtained in the 

HTO region as the API gravity of the high–boiling–point petroleum fractions decreased. The 

activation energy also showed a trend to increase with increasing asphaltene content. The effect 

of adding catalyst (at 3, 5 and 10 % mass of catalyst) on the kinetic parameters was also studied. 

The addition of catalyst increased the reaction rates by providing another pathway (a new 

mechanism) that presented exponential decay activation energy for the cracking reaction in all the 

systems studied. 

Considering the fact that the kinetic parameters exhibit compensation effects, ln A was 

correlated by the linear kinetic compensation equation (see Eq. 13). Hence, it is to be expected 

that the ln A values increase with increasing E value, and  this effect  results in a change in one of 

the Arrhenius parameters, which is compensated by a corresponding change in the other by 



286 

means of the compensation parameters (a
*
 and b

*
). On the other hand, when one considers the 

effect of adding a catalyst, the different treatments with catalyst (addition of 3, 5 and 10 % mass 

of catalyst) resulted in a change in the calculated E–dependence, but with no corresponding 

change in the reaction rate, showing that the E values were strongly dependent on conversion. 

The results showed a decrease in the E–dependence on ? with increasing catalyst content, 

providing an alternative mechanism involving a different transition state and lower activation 

energy.

7.4.     Considerações finais 

O presente trabalho permitiu estabelecer positivamente a verificação do fato de que a 

técnica termoanalítica (DSC) leva a informações úteis e importantes sobre as características 

térmicas dos resíduos pesados de petróleo, em um curto período de tempo. Por conseguinte, a 

caracterização do comportamento térmico dos resíduos de destilação (atmosférica e/ou a vácuo) 

do petróleo, por DSC, pode ser o passo inicial para uma avaliação mais consistente dos mesmos. 

A equação da taxa de reação foi assumida como sendo de primeira ordem levando em 

conta o efeito do catalisador. Os parâmetros cinéticos foram determinados usando calorimetria 

diferencial de varredura avaliando o efeito da compensação cinética, possibilitando bons ajustes 

com os dados experimentais. 

A mudança na energia de ativação da reação de craqueamento não mostrou alteração 

significativa com as taxas de aquecimento testadas. 

A presença do catalisador aumentou a velocidade de uma reação de craqueamento, 

atuando como promotor de uma nova rota de reação com uma menor energia de ativação. O 

catalisador acelera a reação, pois diminui a energia de ativação das moléculas, mas não participa 

da reação, ou seja, não ocorre nenhuma mudança nos elementos químicos da reação. 

A determinação dos parâmetros cinéticos também foi realizada utilizando–se a análise 

do efeito de compensação cinética, a qual foi verificada pela existência linear entre o logaritmo 

neperiano do fator pré–exponencial e a energia de ativação.

Capítulo 8. 

Destilação molecular reativa (tipo 

centrífuga): Modelagem e simulação  
 

8.1.     Introdução 

O processo de destilação molecular reativa (DMR), no qual ocorre o acoplamento de 

destilação molecular e reação química simultaneamente, pode ser qualificado como um processo 

híbrido e também como um processo intensificado.  

Os desenvolvimentos em níveis computacional (modelagem e simulação) e experimental 

do processo de destilação molecular reativa, no qual ocorre o acoplamento de destilação 

molecular e conversão (reação química) simultaneamente, é apresentado nos capítulos 

subsequentes. Entretanto, dadas as configurações do equipamento e as condições operacionais 

que viabilizam a implementação de alto vácuo pode–se submeter o material a temperaturas 

adequadas, em um curto espaço de tempo operacional, garantindo, assim, um contato mais 

intenso da amostra com a superfície catalítica. Esses fatores devem proporcionar alta taxa de 

evaporação e alta cinética de reação e, consequentemente, elevadas taxas de 

conversão/evaporação, permitindo, com isso, altas taxas de processamento.   

Com respeito à modelagem do destilador molecular reativo, essa estará baseada na 

modelagem desenvolvida para o processo de destilação molecular centrífuga de frações de 

petróleo pesado (Tovar et al., 2012). Essa modelagem será devidamente adaptada, com o objetivo 

de fazer estudos de predição e também de avaliação do processo, acarretando, com isso, a 

condução de trabalhos experimentais em condições já otimizadas, possibilitando, assim, a 

verificação dos resultados que seriam conseguidos com uma aplicação experimental. 

A modelagem matemática compreende equações de balanço de massa, energia e 

momento. A taxa de evaporação é a efetiva de Langmuir que considera os efeitos da fase vapor e 

o grau de anisotropia do sistema. A equação da taxa de reação foi assumida como sendo de 

primeira ordem levando em conta o efeito do catalisador. Os parâmetros cinéticos foram 



294 

determinados usando calorimetria exploratória diferencial avaliando o efeito da compensação 

cinética, possibilitando bons ajustes com os dados experimentais. 

A modelagem do processo descrita neste capítulo assume que: 

• O sistema é estabelecido em coordenadas esféricas. 

• O material apresenta um comportamento característico dos fluidos newtonianos, 

altamente viscoso com número de Reynolds baixo característico de um sistema em regime 

laminar. 

• Considerou–se nas simulações deste trabalho um sistema multicomponente, no qual o 

fluido simulado tem propriedades físicas em função do perfil de temperatura na no filme 

líquido que escoa sobre a superfície do evaporador. 

• O filme líquido é considerado incompressível, distribuído uniformemente na superfície do 

evaporador garantindo uma boa transferência de massa. 

• A superfície do evaporador é cônica e internamente aquecida através de resistências 

térmicas. 

• A espessura do filme é considerada muito menor quando comparada com o raio da 

superfície cônica. 

• Com a tentativa de obter a solução numérica para o fluxo em estado estacionário sobre a 

superfície do evaporador, a força gravitacional é desprezível em comparação com a força 

centrífuga. 

• A superfície cônica gira a velocidade angular ?, e o fluxo apresenta simetria axial em 

relação à coordenada ? , o que implica que a velocidade na direção ? é muito menor do 

que a velocidade na direção –? e a velocidade na direção –r. No entanto, baseado no 

trabalho desenvolvido por Medina et al., (2010) apenas o vetor da velocidade na direção 

radial (–r) apresenta variação apreciável com as condições operacionais do processo da 

destilação molecular. 

• Não – ondas , re–evaporação no filme. 

Para a simulação, foi considerado como caso de estudo o processamento de um resíduo

reativo aquecido, onde a superfície do evaporador constitui uma superfície cônica. O resíduo 

atmosférico total foi dividido em 02 pseudo–componentes, os quais foram caracterizados 

utilizando dados de propriedades físico–químicas geradas pelo simulador desenvolvido por Tovar 

et al. (2011). 

O conjunto de (11+18N) equações diferenciais parciais e algébricas e (27+19N) 

variáveis foi incorporado no ambiente computacional, denominado DESTMOL–R, desenvolvido 

na linguagem FORTRAN–90 usando o compilador Compaq Visual Fortran (professional edition 

6.6). O sistema de equações formuladas no filme, ao longo da superfície cônica do evaporador, 

foi resolvido numericamente através do método das linhas. Condições de temperatura do 

evaporador entre 473.15 e 523.15 K e de porcentagem de catalisador entre 3 e 5% m/m foram 

avaliadas. Realizando as simulações do processo, foi possível analisar o comportamento dos 

perfis das variáveis de interesse através da análise das variáveis de entrada (que são a temperatura 

do evaporador e a porcentagem de catalisador) sob os perfis característicos do processo: 

Temperatura na superfície do filme (Ts), espessura do filme (?), taxa de evaporação efetiva (GE), 

taxa de destilado (D), perfil de velocidade (?r), taxa de reação e conversão (?).   

Em relação ao desenvolvimento experimental, ensaios foram desenvolvidos entre 473.15 

e 523.15 K considerando na carga do processo 1, 3 e 5% m/m de catalisador, constituindo um 

processo em catálise heterogênea (termo que descreve a catálise quando o catalisador está em 

uma fase diferente (ou seja sólido) aos reactantes). Como resultados foram obtidos quinze cortes 

de destilados e quinze de resíduos do processo de destilação molecular centrífuga reativa, cujas 

propriedades de massa molar, viscosidade, massa específica e °API foram avaliadas utilizando 

técnicas cromatográficas (SEC do inglês size–exclusion chromatography), análises reológicas e 

métodos padronizados (ASTM D 4052, ASTM D 5002 e ASTM D 70).    

A complexidade química e a identificação estrutural foram analisadas utilizando a 

cromatografia por destilação simulada a elevadas temperaturas (HT–SimDis GC) (ASTM D 

7169).

Abstract 

Reactive molecular distillation process (RMD), in which the molecular distillation 

process and reactive process occur simultaneously, can be characterized as an intensified and 

hybrid process. The modeling of the reactive molecular distillation process (centrifugal type – 

CRMD) to upgrade high–boiling–point petroleum fractions is presented in this work. The 

mathematical model involves equations for the evaluation of the physicochemical properties, 

macroscopic variables (mean free path and Knudsen number), heat, continuity and material 

balances. In the in–situ cracking reaction, it can be assumed that one mole of a cracked 

pseudocomponent (
i

NPSE ) gives one mole each of two other pseudocomponents 

( ,
m n

NPSE NPSE ) and a certain amount of coke (

? ) may also be formed (Gupta, 2006):

NPSE NPSE NPSE H?=???? + + ?    . 

The mathematical model was numerically solved by the numerical method of lines, 

applying centered finite difference to obtain its discretization. A set of (11+18N) equations 

classified as PDEs, ODEs and AEs and (27+19N) variables were processed by the computational 

program named DESTMOL–R, developed in FORTRAN–90 language using Compaq Visual 

Fortran compiler (professional edition 6.6). The modeling was described under steady–state 

conditions. A case study is illustrated for an atmospheric petroleum residue (&gt;673.15 K) of “W” 

crude oil. In this paper, a screening approach, involving the use of the Plackett–Burman and 

fractional factorial designs (2IV
4-1

), permitted the evaluation of the effects of the operating 

conditions (evaporator temperature, feed flow rate, percent weight of catalyst, feed temperature, 

condenser temperature, rotor speed and system pressure) on the relevant process variables, such 

as film thickness, surface evaporation rate, distillate mass flow rate, concentration profiles and 

velocity profiles. 



298 

The results showed that the inlet variables, such as the evaporator temperature, the 

percent weight of catalyst and the feed flow rate were the most relevant operational conditions for 

the final composition of the condensate flow. The concentration of the pseudocomponent “a” 

shrank in both the s– and r– directions, due to the rapid temperature rise in the thin liquid film. 

Consequently, the thickness of the film rapidly decreased in this region, whereas the amount of 

distillate mass flow rate from the split molecules continuously increased throughout the 

evaporator under the selected operational conditions.

1.        Introduction 

Petroleum processing and refining involves a series of steps to convert the crude oil into 

products with the desired properties and qualities. Every day, the processing of crude oil 

produces important quantities of cuts and heavy petroleum residues (high–boiling–point 

petroleum fractions &gt;623.15 K). Heavy petroleum residues present specific characteristics in 

relation to their compositions, such as low H/C ratios, high sulfur and metal contents and are 

constituted of complex hydrocarbons such as paraffins, naphthenes and aromatic compounds 

(Rana et al., 2007). However, there are two types of residue, depending on the source: an 

atmospheric residue, designated as the material at the bottom of the atmospheric distillation 

tower, with an atmospheric equivalent boiling point (AET) above 616.15 K, and a vacuum 

residue, which refers to the material at the bottom of the vacuum distillation tower, with an AET 

above 838.15 K, obtained at 3.33 – 13.33 kPa (Rana et al., 2007; Reddy et al., 1998). 

The upgrading of the residue, basically, involves thermal and catalytic cracking, which 

implies the breaking of large molecules into smaller molecules. These technologies can be 

classified into two main routes as shown in Table 1. However, the processing of heavy crude oil 

and heavy petroleum fractions by the conventional methods listed in Table 1, restricts their use to 

a few applications. Thus, they must be converted into more valuable products.

A technology known as molecular distillation has been largely used in several 

applications in the Separation Process Development Laboratory (LDPS) of the State University 

of Campinas (UNICAMP, Brazil), and appears to be one of the best alternatives to split and to 

characterize heavy liquid petroleum cuts and high–boiling–point petroleum fractions (Zuñiga–

Liñan et al., 2011; Zuñiga et al., 2009; Sbaite et al., 2006; Batistella et al., 2000).  Recently, the 

same research group developed the reactive molecular distillation technique sponsored by the 

Petrobras Research Center–Brazil (CENPES/Petrobras) and the Brazilian Study and Project 

Financing Institution (FINEP). In this process, the molecular distillation and the reactive process 

take place simultaneously.  

2.        Non–conventional heavy residue upgrading technology 

2.1.     The molecular distillation technology 

The molecular distillation (MD) process is a high–tech thermal separation technique, 

operating at pressures in the range from 0.1 to 10 Pa (Tovar, 2012). The potential of MD is due to 

the fact that it is appropriate for the separation and purification of heat sensitive products with 

high–boiling points, since the process occurs under high vacuum at lower temperatures (Zuñiga–

Liñan et al., 2011; Zuñiga et al., 2009; Tovar et al., 2011; Tovar et al., 2010; Xubin et al., 2005; 

Sales–Cruz and Gani, 2006; Batistella et al., 2002; Cvengroš et al., 2000). In the MD process, the 

vapor molecules must find a free path between the evaporator and the condenser, the pressure 

must be low and the width of the distillation gap must be comparable with the mean free path of 

the evaporating molecules. Under these conditions, phase equilibrium does not exist (Hickman, 

1944).  

2.2.     Reactive molecular distillation process  

Many authors define process intensification as a term used to describe a revolutionary 

strategy for any process or plant design to reduce the size of the chemical plant needed, to 

achieve a given production objective, to provide a chemical process with the precise environment 

it needs, and to provide processes which are safer, cleaner, smaller and cheaper (Keil, 2007; 

Stankiewicz and Moulijn, 2002). Keil (2007) presents an overview of the equipment and 

strategies established for process intensification (Figure 1), which achieve reductions in 

investment, energy costs and waste production.

The reactive molecular distillation (RMD) process can be considered as an 

intensified/hybrid process, in which molecular distillation (high vacuum) and reactive process are 

carried out simultaneously. The particular features of the configuration of RMD equipment 

facilitate the implementation of a high vacuum with lower temperatures than used in the 

conventional process, maintain the material inside the equipment for a shorter operational 

residence time, and achieve a very intensive contact between the sample and the catalytic surface. 

These advantages should provide high rates of cracking / split, allowing for high processing rates 

and relatively high conversion degrees. 



302 

This study describes the mathematical modeling of the RMD (centrifugal type– CRMD) 

for high–boiling–point fractions. Accordingly, the RMD process will be represented by the 

temperature, concentration, velocity, effective evaporation rate, distillate mass flow rate, film 

thickness and reaction rate profiles, supporting both the operational analysis and the process 

design at the same time.  

The mathematical model comprises equations for the evaluation of the physicochemical 

properties in order to characterize the reaction and distillation mixtures. Heat and material 

balances involve a system of partial differential and algebraic equations (PDAEs). The set of 

PDAEs was solved by a computer aided environment (DESTMOL–R) developed in FORTRAN–

90 language using Compaq Visual Fortran compiler (professional edition 6.6), using the 

numerical method of lines. 

The simulations were carried out under steady–state conditions. The output variables, 

such as the surface temperature (Ts), film thickness (?), effective evaporation rate (GE), distillate 

mass flow rate (D), radial velocity (?r), concentration of pseudocomponent “a” (Xa) and the 

conversion degree (?) profiles, were computed by analyzing the effects of the operational 

conditions (the evaporator temperature (EVT), feed flow rate (Q), percent weight of catalyst 

(%CAT), feed temperature (Tfeed), condenser temperature (Tcond), rotor speed (RS) and the system 

pressure (Ps)). The variables were screened using a 16–run Plackett–Burman design followed by 

a fractional factorial design (2IV
4–1

), since this allowed for the simultaneous consideration of 

several variables at different levels (upper limits and lower limits), using a reduced number of 

simulations. The higher order interactions were negligible. All the data were treated using the 

software Statistica 7.0 from Statsoft Inc (2004). 

2.2.1.     Centrifugal reactive–molecular distiller operation  

The centrifugal reactive–molecular distillation (CRMD) process, a type of RMD 

process, represents the coupling of the in–situ catalytic reaction and the centrifugal molecular 

distillation process, in which the evaporating liquid film is formed due to the centrifugal force. 

The introduction of the reaction into the separation process zone leads to know interactions 

between the mass transfer rates, diffusion and chemical kinetics .  

 The reactive centrifugal molecular distiller has a rapidly rotating spinning cone to create 

a rapidly spreading and moving film of liquid. When the rotating cone is heated, the 



 

303 

reaction/evaporation takes place (Figure 2a). The CRMD unit consists of a heated spinning rotor 

housed in a vacuum chamber (Figure 2b).

The material, constituted of a high–boiling–point petroleum fraction plus catalyst 

(heterogeneous catalysis), is pumped into the center of the heated rotating disk, and the feedstock 

is spread over the inside of the chamber by the centrifugal force. By way of a careful control of 

the heater temperature, the molecules are cracked on the rotor (by the effect of the high vacuum 

and low temperatures) into lower molar mass molecules, which evaporate and condense on the 

cooled condenser. The lighter distillate molecules (cracked molecules) are pumped from the 

(a)

system via the distillate collect valve into the distillate collector. The portion which does not 

distill (called the residue stream) is pumped from the CRMD unit via the collect valve into the 

collector system. 

3.        Mathematical description 

The mathematical description is based on the modeling of the centrifugal molecular 

distillation process proposed by Tovar (2012), Kawala and Stephan (1989), Bruin (1969), 

Inuzuka et al. (1989)  and Inuzuka et al. (1986) as a starting point to develop a specific modeling 

of the CRMD process for high–boiling–point petroleum fractions. The following assumptions 

were made to develop the generalized two–dimensional steady state mathematical model of the 

CRMD process: 

• The evaporator surface is conical and heated internally by the coils at a constant 

temperature (EVT). 

• The spherical coordinate system is well–matched to the model developed (Figure 3).The 

conical surface rotates at a fixed angular velocity, ?, and a coordinate s, instead of ?, is 

introduced as follows: 

d ds r ?? =  (1) 

 
Figure 3. Sketch of the coordinate system of the rotor in the reactive molecular distiller (Tovar et al., 2011). 

 



 

305 

• The flow over the evaporator surface is in the form of a thin liquid film. The pattern itself 

is essentially stationary.  The flow is laminar and practically no waves are formed on the 

surface of the thin film. Furthermore, the liquid film is considered to be incompressible 

and uniformly distributed on the evaporator wall, guaranteeing excellent mass transfer.  

• The liquid film thickness is very small in comparison with the radius of the conical 

surface. It is assumed to be a Newtonian fluid. The evaporated liquid is highly viscous, 

and hence the Reynolds numbers are small. 

• Re–evaporation and splashing phenomena are both neglected, and the diffusion process in 

the ?–direction is also neglected. 

• Gravitational force is negligibly in comparison with the centrifugal force. 

• The velocity components in the ?– and ?–directions, respectively, are negligible when 

compared with the radial velocity component (in the r–direction). 

• The thermophysical properties (specific heat capacity, thermal conductivity, kinematic 

viscosity, vapor pressure, effective evaporation rate and evaporation enthalpy), are 

functions of the temperature (at the evaporator wall) and the surface temperature (Ts) 

profile on the inside of the thin liquid film.

3.2.     Velocity profile of the liquid film 

Mathematically, the velocity profile in the liquid film is expressed by Equation (3), and 

from the integration with Equations (5) and (6), it is possible to obtain an expression for 

determining the velocity profile as a function of the thickness of the liquid film in the s–direction,

3.3.     Thickness of the evaporating film 

The film thickness (?) is fundamental to evaluate the velocity profile (Equation 7). This 

varies with radial distance along the evaporator surface, due to the axial and radial gradients of 

the temperature in the liquid film. Substituting Equation (7) in the volumetric flow rate equation 

(Equation 2), and solving the continuity equation with the corresponding boundary conditions, 

the film thickness is given by Equation (8) (Inuzuka et al., 1986):

3.4.     Overall distillate mass flow rate 

The overall distillate mass flow rate (D) is defined as the sum of the local distillate mass 

flow rates, and therefore presents variations in the r–direction, as already discussed by Inuzuka et 

al. (1986), as follows:

3.5.     Effective evaporation rate 

 The effective evaporation rate (GE) is calculated using the modified Langmuir–Knudsen 

equation described by Equation (10), which takes the anisotropic properties of the vapor into 

account (Tovar, 2012; Kawala and Dakiniewicz, 2002; Kawala and Stephan, 1989; Langmuir, 

1913; Lutišan et al., 2002).

the vapor phase to the characteristic length (L) (Equation 11), R is the universal gas constant and 

n’ represents the number of intermolecular collisions before the vapor reaches the isotropic state 

(n’=5) (Kawala and Stephan, 1989) and the degree of anisotropy k* of the vapor phase in the

3.6.     Temperature profile in the liquid film 

In the case of a heated evaporator surface, there is heat exchange between the inner 

surface and the liquid film. Reaction/evaporation phenomena take place at the free surface of the 

liquid and the heat required is supplied from the deeper layers by conduction, forced convection 

and heat reaction. Consequently, temperature gradients in the liquid film are generated and are 

defined by Equation (16).

3.8.     Approximate reaction equation for the catalytic reaction term   

A heterogeneous catalytic system was assumed using the zeolite–based catalyst CR–1 

(regenerated catalyst used for FCC technology containing  48.3 % mass of alumina, and particle 

size of 67µm). The catalyst CR–1 was assumed mixed with the high–boiling–point petroleum 

fraction, constituting the load to the CRMD process. The approach to the catalytic reaction 

carried out in the evaporation zone during the CRMD process was already presented in a previous 

paper (Tovar et al., 2011). The pseudocomponent–based approach for simulating the CRMD 

process of a high–boiling–point petroleum fraction is highly successful if it is assumed that when 

one mole of a pseudocomponent is cracked it gives one mole each of two other 

pseudocomponents, and a certain amount of coke may also be formed as described in Equation 

(38) (Gupta, 2006).

Where i, m and n are the numbers of the pseudocomponents, ?i,m,n is the amount of coke 

formed  when the i

hour; it is possible to define the rate of reaction. The theoretical kinetic scheme presented in this 

paper assumes that the cracking reaction is of first order (pseudo first order reaction), and for a 

pseudo first–order reaction, it should be possible to represent the rate of disappearance of the i

Nevertheless, Blanding (1953) presented the influence of the catalyst on the reaction rate 

as being a proportional relationship with some power of the partial pressure of the reactant 

surrounding the catalyst, as follows:

3.8.1.     Kinetic parameters 

The reaction rate constant, "k , is assumed to follow the Arrhenius equation in terms of 

the kinetic parameters (pre–exponential factor, A and the activation energy, E). The kinetic 

parameters used in this study were determined in a previous work (Tovar et al., 2011) based on 

the kinetic compensation effect (KCE), where the pre–exponential factor, A, varied with the 

activation energy, E, according to Equation (45) (Khawam, 2007):  

* *
ln A a E b= +  (45) 

Where a
*
 and b

*
 are constant coefficients and act as compensation parameters. 

And the E–dependence on ? is given as:

Where E0 and E1 are constants

Table 5 summarizes the list of variables and parameters used in the model. The degrees 

of freedom of the model were determined in a way similar to that used in the analysis carried out 

by Sales–Cruz and Gani (2006). The CRMD model described above, consisting of Equation (2) – 

(46), is a PDAE system with (11+18N) equations classified as: (1+N) PDEs (Equations 16 and 

20), (2) ODE (Equations 2 and 9) and (8+17N) AEs (Equations 7 – 8, 10 – 15, 25 – 37, 44 – 46 

and the Arrhenius equation). The total number of variables (27+19N) are classified as: (10+N) 

known, (6) parameters, (9+16N) explicit and (2+2N) dependent. Hence the degrees of freedom 

are (16+N), which means that some of the variables must be specified as: three (3) fixed variables 

(Rg, NA and Pi), five (5) geometrical parameters (RD, r0, L, ?’, de), seven (7+N) operational 

conditions (EVT, Q, Ps, RS, Tfeed, Tcond, %CAT, XNPSEi) and one (1) model parameter (n’).

5.        Computational tool  

In the previous section the CRMD model obtained was presented in three stages: (i) The 

first step refers to the model definition, where the modeling assumptions were established; (ii) in 



314 

the second step the specific model was derived from the evaluation of the physicochemical 

properties, macroscopic variables (mean free path and Knudsen number), heat, continuity and 

material balances and the diffusion equation, and (iii) The degrees of freedom. These three stages 

have been implemented in the computational aid named DESTMOL–R, developed in 

FORTRAN–90 language using Compaq Visual Fortran compiler (professional edition 6.6). 

5.1.     Numerical solution strategy  

In order to solve the CRMD model represented by a set of PDAEs, the method of lines is 

used to obtain its discretization form in one dimension (s–direction), and the semi–discrete 

problem then integrated as a system of ODEs and DAEs, which are then solved using ODE 

solvers (Schiesser, 1991). The space derivatives are discretized in the DESTMOL–R 

computational tool (see basic structure of DESTMOL–R in Figure 4), by applying second order 

centered finite difference. In particular, considering F(r,s) as the functions, the PDEs can be 

approximated as follows:

(49) 

In the present study using the evaporator model in the CRMD process, discretization is 

carried out for the film thickness in the s–direction (with a minimum value of 11 points) and 

along the r–direction (with a minimum value of 101 points); which gives a trade–off between 

higher–accuracy discretization, with a reasonable number of equations and good computational 

time. In Figure 5, each bullet stands for a discretization point, where the original PDE behavior is 

approximated by an ODE. The resulting system of ODEs and DAEs were solved using the 

DESOLV and RKF45 (fifth/fourth order Runge Kutta Fehlberg with adaptive step sizing 

(Mathews and Fink, 2004)) subroutines available in the FORTRAN–90 code.

5.2.     Model evaluation 

The model was evaluated by analyzing the effects of each independent variable (EVT, 

%CAT, Q, RS, Tcond, Tfeed and Ps) on the dependent variables (Ts, ?, D, GE, ?r, xa and ?). The 

statistical analysis was carried out using the software Statistica 7.0 from Statsoft Inc (2004). 

Dependent variables were evaluated at the radial position (ro) equals 0.3 m related to the distance 

from apex at which the thin liquid film gets out evaporator surface. 

5.2.1.     Plackett–Burman design  

This paper aims to provide a sensitivity analysis to determine the sensitivity of the 

response variables (output variables) of the model due to changes in the input variables. The 

Plackett–Burman design (Plackett and Burman, 1946) was used in the present study to screen the 

most important process variables that significantly influenced the yield in the centrifugal 

reactive–molecular distillation process (CRMD): the conversion degree (?), the concentration of 

the final products (Xa), the effective evaporation rate (GE), the film thickness (?), the radial 

velocity (?r) and the surface temperature (Ts) profiles. In this study, a 16–run Plackett–Burman 

design plus a central point was applied to evaluate seven factors, namely the evaporator 

temperature (EVT), feed flow rate (Q), pressure system (Ps), percent weight of catalyst (%CAT), 

feed temperature (Tfeed), condenser temperature (Tcond) and rotor speed (RS). Thus a total of seven 

variables was selected, and each variable examined at two levels: +1 for the upper level and –1 

for the lower level (Table 6) plus eight dummy variables, giving a total of 16 trials plus a central 

point, as shown in Table 7.

5.2.2.     Fractional factorial screening design  

The next step in the formulation of the variables shown to be the most important one in 

the CRMD process (EVT, Q, RS and %CAT) with respect to the response variables, was to carry 

out a 2IV
(4-1)

 fractional factorial design.  This means that 04 factors will be studied (the first 

number in parentheses), although 01 of these factors (the second number in parentheses) was 

generated from the interactions of a full 2
((4-1)=3)

 factorial design. As a result, the design does not 

give full resolution; that is, some factors and each interaction are totally confounded with one of 

the main effects. In this resolution IV design, the main effects of the factors examined are not 

confounded with any other interaction of an order less than 4?1=3. Also, two–way interactions 

are not confounded with any other interaction of an order less than 4?2=2 (Loukas, 1998). Each 

variable was ranked as –1 and +1 corresponding to the lower and upper levels, respectively, as 

shown in Table 8. A central point (0) run was also added. Table 9 shows the design for the total 

of nine (09) runs at the -1 and +1 levels (at Ps=40 Pa; Tfeed= 393.15 K and Tcond=353.15 K).

6.        Results and discussion 

6.1.     Screening of the significant variables using the Plackett–Burman design 

A total of seven (07) variables were analyzed with regard to their effects on the yield of 

the CRMD process as a function of the distillate mass flow rate (D), the concentration of final 

product (Xa), the effective evaporation rate (GE), the film thickness (?), radial velocity (?r) and 

surface temperature (Ts) profiles, using the Plackett–Burman design. The design matrix selected 

for the screening of significant variables is shown in Table 7. Factors evidencing p–values less 

than 0.05 were considered to have significant effects on the response, and were therefore selected 

for further screening studies. 

Distillate mass flow rate (D) and effective evaporation rate (GE) responses: The 

evaporator temperature (EVT), a variable associated with the x1 factor, with a probability value of 

3.180x10
-16

 and 2.091x10
-17

, respectively for D and GE, was shown to be the most significant 

factor (Table 10). The lower probability values indicate the most significant factors with respect 

to the responses D and GE. 

Film thickness (?) and radial velocity (?r): The feed flow rate (Q), associated with the x2 

factor, with a probability of 8.021x10
-16

 and 1.077x10
-15

, respectively for ? and ?r, was shown to 

be the most significant factor, followed by the variables of rotor speed (RS) and evaporator 

temperature (EVT). Two of the three significant variables screened, EVT and RS, exerted negative 

effects on ? (Table 10).

evaporator temperature (EVT), associated with x1, with a probability value of 7.295x10

 and 

6.505x10
-11

, respectively, for Xa and ?, was shown to be the most significant factor, followed by 

the feed flow rate (Q), rotor speed (RS), weight percent of catalyst (%CAT) and condenser 

temperature (Tcond). The lower probability values indicate the more significant factors with 

respect to Xa and ?. Two of the five significant variables screened, EVT and %CAT, exerted a 

negative effect on Xa. On the other hand, three of the five significant variables screened, Q, Tcond 

and RS, exerted a negative effect on ?. In other words, when EVT and %CAT were raised, Xa 

decreased; and similarly, when Q, Tcond and RS were raised, ? decreased (Table 10). 

Of the significant variables identified, Tcond was excluded from the process analyses and 

fixed at the lowest level (353.15 K). The condenser temperature (Tcond) ingoing the peripheral of 

the conical evaporation surface of a centrifugal reactive–molecular evaporator corresponds to an 

important operational parameter. Practical experience over many years with the operation of 

centrifugal molecular evaporator, developed in our research laboratories, has shown that the 

optimum temperature of the condenser (Tcond) should differ at least 50 K lower from the working 

temperature (evaporator temperature) inside the evaporator, pointing to the advantages from the 

first moment the distilled liquid gets onto the evaporation surface, reaching higher effective 

evaporation rate to the operation temperature, since, the most volatile molecules reach the 

condenser surface and the intermolecular collisions in the region of interest (space between the 

evaporator and the condenser surfaces) are much less frequent than molecular interactions. In this 

sense, in the CRMD process, in which the coupling of the centrifugal molecular distillation and 

catalytic chemical reaction (in heterogeneous catalysis) takes place simultaneously, setting the 

condenser temperature (Tcond) at 353.15 K is guaranteed higher effective evaporation rate to the 

operation temperature keeping a substantial temperature difference between wall temperature 

(evaporator temperature, EVT) and the condenser temperature (Tcond) even under steady–state 

conditions. On the other hand, the other insignificant variables were also ignored (Tfeed and Ps), 

and fixed at 393.15 K and 40 Pa, respectively. The screening levels of the four variables, (EVT, 

Q, RS and %CAT) were further analyzed using a (2IV
(4-1)

) fractional factorial design .

321 

In this case the CRMD process could be influenced by multiple variables (EVT, Q, 

%CAT and RS). The statistical factorial design has been shown to be a powerful tool for 

determining the effects of the operating conditions on the dependent variables. A four factor, 

two–level 2IV
4?1

 fractional factorial design was used, which means carrying out nine (09) 

simulations. The (2IV
4-1

) fractional factorial design can cover the main and interaction effects of 

the parameters within the range of selected variables, but higher order interactions are negligible. 

In other words, interactions such as two and three–factor ones are considered to be residual. The 

effects of the parameters studied are presented comparatively in Table 11.

An analysis of the effects of the principal factors showed that EVT, Q and RS caused 

significant variation in the responses, EVT being the most important variable. According to the 

negative effect of this parameter, the results showed that as the EVT rises, so the distillate mass 

flow rate (D) may decrease as a consequence of the reduction in mass transfer within the thin 

film, because the density of the evaporating molecules increases during the reactive process, 

within the evaporating gap. Hence, with higher EVT and %CAT values, low MFP values are 

obtained, because the density of the molecules rises in the distillation gap, and the motion of the 

particles in the distillation gap causes isotropic behavior. Under these conditions, the evaporation 

rate of the molecule with the lowest vapor pressure was lower than the molecule with the lowest 

vapor pressure in the non–catalytic process, and, in consequence, a lower evaporation rate values 

were reported. Qualitatively, this result is in agreement with the CRMD process, and it is related 

to the successive cracking of heavier molecules inner the thin liquid film into lighter molecules 

raising the molecular collisions in the distillation gap. 

Moreover, the variable %CAT should be included in the analysis since it has a direct 

influence on the reaction process, such that, kinetically, the catalytic reaction that occurs during 

the CRMD process is characterized by the frequency of contact between the species with the 

inner reacting surface of the thin film and the heated surface of the evaporator. Similarly, in 

heterogeneous catalysis, the diffusion of these species and the diffusion of products from these 

surfaces becomes the determining step of the reaction rate. 

Furthermore, the mathematical model of the CRMD process allows for the prediction of 

the entire profiles of the variables studied along the radial position (RD) over the evaporator 

surface and thin film thickness, as shown in Figures 6 – 14, considering a value for RS equal to 

800 rpm. The results presented in Figures 6 – 14 confirm that at lower values of the variable RS, 

it is possible to maintain the efficiency of the reaction, followed by the separation stage, 

obtaining results for the degree of conversion of about 42% and 48%, respectively.

concentration of pseudocomponent “a” (Xa) and conversion degree (?) all vary continuously 

along the radial position (RD) and are highly influenced by the EVT. Thus, the EVT is one of the 

important operating parameters, which determines the rate of evaporation governing the 

separation process. On the other hand, both the variables EVT and %CAT determine the 

continuous decreasing of the concentration of heavier molecules in the thin liquid film, governing 

the in–situ catalytic reactive process. 

Considering that the catalytic reaction involves breaking complex hydrocarbons (heavier 

molecules) into simpler molecules (lighter molecules), in order to increase the quality and 

quantity of the final product, obtaining a more desirable product, the concentration of the 

products and the conversion degree (?) are sensitive to changes in the selected parameters such 

as the feed flow rate (Q), the evaporator temperature (EVT) and the weight percent of catalyst 

(%CAT). Thus the upgrading of high–boiling–point petroleum fractions by the CRMD process 

may involve the rearrangement of the molecular structure of the hydrocarbon compounds to 



328 

convert heavy hydrocarbon feedstock into lighter petroleum fractions. In fact, from the initial 

mixture, pseudocomponent “a” is the main compound that reacts, evaporates and condenses, and 

products are obtained in both the distillate and residue streams (Figures 6e – 14e). Thus a rise in 

surface temperature (Ts) is related to an increase in the evaporation rate of the products generated 

from the in–situ catalytic reaction in the separation zone, which confirms the fact that the most 

significant variables in the CRMD process are the EVT and the %CAT, enhancing the reaction 

and the separation process in the same process unit. 

7.        Conclusions and outlook 

The goal of this study was to present the modeling of the reactive molecular distillation 

(centrifugal type)–CRMD process. The set of PDAEs (11+18N) for the generalized model was 

constituted of: material and energy balance equations, physical properties, kinetic model, velocity 

equation and liquid film thickness, overall distillate mass flow rate, effective evaporation rate and 

concentration profile of the fluid over the evaporator surface.  

The general reactive molecular distillation (centrifugal type) model offered the possibility 

of studying a large range of operating conditions. The new features of the general model 

regarding the centrifugal molecular distillation model, includes the reaction term. Therefore, a 

computer aided environment (DESTMOL–R), which facilitates the solution of different 

simulation problems, was built up. The computational approach helped to obtain qualitative and 

quantitative results, to improve the design and to identify the operational conditions for a given 

case study. 

The Plackett–Burman and fractional factorial designs were carried out to identify the 

predominant variables affecting the response variables (Ts, D, GE, ?, ?r, Xa and ?). The factorial 

designs were carried out at two levels of the operating variables (EVT, Q, %CAT, Tfeed, Tcond, RS 

and Ps). This set of simulations focused mainly on screening out the variables that could enhance 

the CRMD process with respect to higher conversion of the reactants, higher evaporation rates 

and higher distillate mass flow rates. 

Consequently, the evaluation of the steady state model showed that the film surface 

temperature, the evaporation rate, the overall distillate mass flow rate and the conversion degree 

were strongly affected by the operating conditions (evaporator temperature, EVT; feed flow rate, 

Q; rotor speed, RS and percentage weight of catalyst, %CAT). However, the feed flow rate (Q) 



 

329 

and rotor speed (RS) could be fixed at low levels of around 1.473 kg·h
-1

 and 800 rpm, 

respectively, in future experimental trials.  

The current and future studies are related to experimental work developed in the 

LDPS/LOPCA research laboratories at UNICAMP, in order to validate the DESTMOL–R tool 

and check the performance of the CRMD process.

Centrifugal reactive–molecular distillation: An intensified process–Part II 

Key operating variables and their effects on the performance of the centrifugal 

reactive–molecular distillation process 

Abstract 

In an earlier paper, the reactive molecular distillation process was presented with the 

main purpose of upgrading the high–boiling–point petroleum fractions. A steady–state model for 

describing the catalytic molecular distillation process was established, and solved with the 

method of lines.  

In this work, a computational study was developed using the DESTMOL–R tool 

developed in FORTRAN–90 language using Compaq Visual Fortran compiler (professional 

edition 6.6) in order to evaluate the effects of the operating conditions (evaporator temperature 

and weight percent of catalyst) on the performance of the centrifugal reactive–molecular 

distillation process (CRMD) in terms of the film thickness, surface evaporation rate, distillate 

rate, concentration profiles, velocity and the conversion profiles. The simulations were carried 

out at the steady–state conditions. The influence of adding a catalyst (3 and 5 %wt) was 

examined. The process temperature (evaporator temperature) range was from 473.15 K to 523.15 

K and the constant feed flow rate was 1.473 kg·h
-1

. 

The results showed that the inlet variables: the evaporator temperature and the percent 

weight of catalyst were relevant operational conditions for the performance of the CRMD process 

reaching an conversion of the feedstock about 65% in the distillate stream and 48% in the residue 

stream with 3 and 5 weight percent of catalyst.  



338 

The objective of the experimental work was not only to validate the profiles estimation 

but also characterize the 20 fractions (10 distillates and 10 residues) obtained from CRMD 

process under the operating conditions. Because of the complex composition of products obtained 

by CRMD, high–temperature simulated distillation using gas chromatography (HT–SimDis GC) 

based on ASTM D 7169 was used in order to evaluate the extent conversion and to characterize 

converted products. 

The experimental results agreed well with those obtained from the theoretical simulation 

calculations, indicating the accuracy and reliability of the mathematical model, since the average 

absolute deviation (AAD%) was no larger than 6.82%, 9.39% and 14.92% for the distillate mass 

flow rate and the extent of conversion in the distillate and the residue stream, respectively. 

Finally, the CRMD model can provide theoretical guidance for the further experimental runs and 

process optimization. 

Keywords: Centrifugal reactive–molecular distillation, DESTMOL–R, distillate mass 

flow rate, degree of conversion, upgrading high–boiling–point petroleum fraction.

1.        Introduction 

In an earlier work, the centrifugal reactive–molecular distillation (CRMD) process was 

presented as a technique developed and implemented by the Separation Process Development 

Laboratory (LDPS) and the Optimization, Project and Advanced Control Laboratory (LOPCA) of 

the Chemical Engineering School of UNICAMP, sponsored by the Petrobras Research 

Center(CENPES/Petrobras, Brazil) and Brazilian Study and Project Financing Institution

(FINEP), and aimed at enhancing the performance of the heavy petroleum fractions and heavy 

petroleum crude oil. 

 The CRMD process, in which the coupling of the centrifugal molecular distillation and 

catalytic chemical reaction (in heterogeneous catalysis) takes place simultaneously, might be 

considered as one of the most important concepts for the upgrading of residues in the petroleum 

industry. This process has attracted considerable attention because of its remarkable advantages, 

principally its in–situ reaction, which occurs in the reaction and separation zones or evaporation 

gap (distance between the evaporator and the condenser surface of the CRMD unit). The most 

promising aspects related to the efficiency and operating conditions of the catalytic CRMD 

process are listed below: 

• The integration of the reaction and separation processes, simultaneously, leads to a 

reduction in the number of variables influencing the process (evaporator temperature and 

weight percent of catalyst), and in the response variables measured and quantified (exit 

flow rates and conversion degree of the reaction). 

• Operation in the presence of small amounts of catalyst. 

• Accomplishment of operational temperatures and pressures (below 50 Pa), depending on 

the characteristics of the reactants, the amount of catalyst and the products desired. 

• High rates of reaction–evaporation–split, allowing for high processing rates and relatively 

high conversion degrees. 

• Lower exposure time of the reactants with the catalyst and the process conditions. 

• Optimum configuration of the reaction and separation zones in the CRMD unit. 

 Thus, the CRMD process results in a so–called hybrid, intensified process (Tovar, 2012; 

Winter, 2011). In a catalytic CRMD process, the reaction–evaporation, condensation–diffusion 

couplings in the thin liquid film, flowing over the evaporator surface (which is a multi–

component system), implies in heat and mass transfer processes. As a consequence, Tovar (2012) 

proposed a modeling approach, taking into account the momentum, and the mass and energy 

balance equations, including the reaction term, as well as the Langmuir–Knudsen equation 

derived from the kinetic theory for the ideal gas to describe the effective evaporation rate, which 

takes into account the anisotropic properties of the vapor.

A computational study was developed using the DESTMOL–R computational tool in 

order to evaluate the operating conditions (evaporator temperature, feed flow rate, weight percent 

of catalyst, feed temperature, condenser temperature, rotor speed and system pressure) on the 

relevant process variables, such as film thickness, surface evaporation rate, distillate mass flow 

rate, concentration profiles, velocity and conversion profiles (Tovar, 2012).  

The aim of this paper was to provide a comprehensive overview of the use of the 

DESTMOL–R computational environment to model and simulate the CRMD under key operating 

conditions (EVT and %CAT). The theoretical study was illustrated for the upgrading of a high–

boiling–point petroleum fraction (atmospheric residue of 673.15 K
+
 of “W” crude oil), divided 

into two (02) pseudocomponents. In the simulation of the process, a thin liquid film, a heated 

evaporator surface and a very low pressure system were considered. 

The CRMD process was modeled according to the mass, momentum and energy balance 

equations. The simulations were carried out under steady–state conditions, and the output 

variables, such as surface temperature (Ts), film thickness (?), effective evaporation rate (GE), 

distillate rate (D), reactant concentrations (XNPSEi) and conversion (?) profiles were computed. A 

steady–state model was then used to describe the catalytic molecular distillation process and 

solved with the numerical method of lines. Simulations were carried out in the evaporator 

temperature range (EVT) from 473.15 K to 523.15 K, with the feed flow rate (Q) fixed at 1.473 

kg·h
–1

. The influence of adding a catalyst (3 and 5 %wt) was examined, and different 

experimental runs were used to validate the model. The derived results related to the distillate 

mass flow rate and conversion degree were validated using the experimental data obtained 

previously from a pilot plant, and presented in Tovar (2012) and Winter  (2011). Accordingly, the 

performance of the CRMD process was examined in two ways: (i) evaluation of the conversion 

degree of the feedstock (ATR–W) at the outlet section of the evaporator surface, and (ii) 

identification of the products (distillate and residue streams) and quantification of their yields.  

 2.        Modeling approach  

The mathematical description is based on the modeling of the centrifugal molecular 

distillation process proposed by Tovar (2012), Kawala and Stephan (1989), Bruin (1969), 

Inuzuka et al. (1986) and Inuzuka et al. (1989), and adapted to include the kinetic reaction term.

To develop the generalized two–dimensional steady state mathematical model of the 

CRMD process, the following assumptions were made: (i) the model uses a spherical coordinate 

system, adopting the relationship d ds r ?? = ; (ii) the liquid flow is considered to be steady state; 

(iii) the liquid film thickness is very small in comparison with the radius of the conical surface; 

(iv) the velocity components in ?– and ?– directions are negligible in comparison with the 

velocity component in r–direction; (v) the thin liquid film is completely viscous and is in a 

laminar regime ; (vi) the liquid has the same rotational speed as the rotating surface; (vii) the 

gravitational force is negligible in comparison with the centrifugal force; (viii) the evaporator is 

assumed to have a conical shape and it is heated internally, attaining a constant temperature 

called the evaporator temperature (EVT); and (ix) the condensing surface is maintained at a 

constant temperature, Tcond.  

The CRMD model used in this paper is based on the thin liquid film and consists of the 

material and energy balances over the evaporator surface (see Figure 1). The steady–state 

component balances and algebraic equations related to the effective evaporation rate for the 

liquid system are presented as follows:

2.1.     Chemical system and reaction kinetics 

A heterogeneous catalytic system was assumed using the zeolite–based catalyst CR–1 

(regenerated catalyst used for FCC technology containing  48.3 % mass of alumina, and particle 

size of 67µm). The catalyst CR–1 was mixed with the atmospheric petroleum residue, 

constituting the load to the CRMD process. The cracking reaction is an endothermic reaction and 

it is explained in Tovar et al. (2011). In the cracking catalytic reaction, it is assumed that the 

cracking of one mole of a pseudocomponent  produces  one mole each of two other 

pseudocomponents, and also a certain amount of coke may  be formed, as described in Equation 

(18) (Gupta, 2006).

2.2.    Thermodynamics and physical properties  

The physical properties such as densities, viscosities and thermal conductivities were 

calculated by the methods studied in Tovar et al., (2011).  

2.3.     Solution strategy 

For the numerical solution, a careful analysis of the appropriate variables was carried out 

(Tovar, 2012). The mathematical model presented above comprises a system of partial 

differential algebraic equations (PDAEs) solved numerically using the method of lines. The film 

thickness was discretized at 11 points along the radial distance (RD) of 101 points. With this 

discretization, good simulation performance was guaranteed. Furthermore, all the model 

equations were implemented into the DESTMOL–R computational environment, developed in 

FORTRAN–90 language using Compaq Visual Fortran compiler (professional edition 6.6) to 

solve the overall system using the  DESOLV and RKF45 (fifth/fourth order Runge Kutta 

Fehlberg with adaptive step sizing (Mathews and Fink, 2004)) subroutines. 

3.        Experimental set–up of the CRMD  

The experiments were carried out in the CRMD pilot plant shown in Figure 2. The series 

316 stainless steel CRMD unit has an evaporator with an inner diameter of 400 mm and a conical 

shape with a half angle of 70°. The operating pressure lies between 40 and 50 Pa and the 

operating temperature is up to 523.15 K. A detailed description of the CRMD unit and the 

experimental methodology can be found in Winter (2011). 

All process data such as temperatures (evaporator, outlet stream, trap and cooling 

system), system pressure, flow rates (feed and outlet streams) and rotor speed are displayed and 

monitored by a process control system. Liquid outlet samples (distillate and residue streams) are 

collected in a gutter surrounding the rotor, and then flow down to the collector vessel. The 

samples (converted products) were analyzed by high–temperature simulated distillation using gas 

chromatography (HT–SimDis GC) based on ASTM D 7169 (2011), with a capillary column 

(Tovar, 2012). The experimental trial and simulation of the process for high–boiling–point 

petroleum fraction (ATR–W) upgrading,  were based on theoretical studies of the parameters to 

determine the appropriate operating ranges for both variables, the evaporator temperature (EVT) 

and the percent weight of catalyst (%CAT) (Tovar, 2012).

4.1.     Model results 

The solution of the evaporator model for the upgrading of the atmospheric petroleum 

residue ATR–W provides simulated values for the output variables such as surface temperature 

(Ts), film thickness (?), effective evaporation rate (GE), distillate rate (D), concentration of 

reactant (XNPSEi) profiles and conversion (?) profiles, both in the distillate and residue streams, as 

shown in Figures 3 – 9 against the evaporator length (radial distance, RD) on the horizontal axis. 

According to these results, the ATR–W was upgraded well, as shown by an analysis of the 

performance of the liquid film. 

As already mentioned in a previous manuscript (Tovar, 2012), the film surface 

temperature, Ts, represents the determining factor in the CRMD process. Thus, the film surface 

temperature was determined along the RD as a function of the evaporator temperature and weight 

percent of catalyst (3 and 5 %wt of catalyst), at constant liquid load (1.473 kg.h
-1

) and a constant 

liquid feed temperature (423.15 K). The temperature of the film surface, (Ts), increases gradually 

along the film length, and reaches an asymptotic value corresponding to the outlet region of the 

evaporator, as shown in Figure 3. Furthermore, Ts increases with the evaporator temperature 



 

347 

(EVT, evaporator wall temperature) and establishes a temperature gradient inside the film, where 

the reaction of the heaviest pseudocomponent occurs, followed by evaporation of the more 

volatile pseudocomponent.

523.15 K 

 

 Furthermore, the EVT was the most important governing condition in the reaction and 

evaporation process. Hence, when a thin liquid film of a multicomponents flows over a heated 

evaporator surface, under vacuum conditions (Table 3), the reaction inner the film and 

evaporation phenomenon at the free surface lead to cracking of heavier molecules and the 

depletion of the most volatile component or components in the liquid phase, forming a thin liquid 

film that, evenly, might to condense along the condenser surface. As a result, the distillate flow 

increases as consequence of: (i) High amount of molecules with low molar mass; (ii) the elevated 

film surface temperature; (iii) the decrease of the film thickness on the evaporator surface and, 

(iv) advantageous operating conditions on the centrifugal reactive molecular distillation process. 

Moreover, results showed that the radial thermal gradients inner the thin liquid film 

produced a significantly change in the distillate mass flow rate (D) profiles. Figure 4 showed that

D varied strongly after the center of evaporator surface, representing how fast the front of liquid 

film flow advances along the evaporator surface and how the fluid flow changes into the vapor 

state over the evaporator surface, which means that the GE and ? profiles are greatly influenced 

by EVT as operating condition.

523.15 K 

 

However, in our previous paper was described that with higher EVT and %CAT values 

caused a larger molecule density and the distillate mass flow rate (D) may decrease as a 

consequence of the reduction in mass transfer within the thin film (Tovar, 2012). Nevertheless, in 

the evaporator temperature (EVT) range studied in the present work the split process is governed 

by the rise of EVT while the cracking process is driven at the cracking temperature between 

473.15 K and 483.15 K when considered 3 – 5 wt% of catalyst and 40 – 50 Pa, respectively. 

Thus, when considered at EVT between 483.15 and 523.15 K the evaporation phenomenon at the 

free surface, leads to depletion of the most volatile component in the liquid phase, forming a thin 

liquid film and D varied strongly after the center of evaporator surface, representing how fast the 

front of liquid film flow advances along the evaporator surface and how the fluid flow changes 

into the vapor state over the evaporator surface.

  On the other hand, the effective evaporation rate (GE) was studied as a function of RD 

for various EVT values at a fixed feed flow rate (Figure 5). In this case, the functional path was as 

expected, following a relaxation length (0.15 m) corresponding to the center zone of the 

evaporator surface. Nevertheless, Figure 5 shows that the behavior of the effective evaporation 

rate (GE) follows downward as a function of RD under different EVT conditions. Qualitatively, 

this result is in agreement with the CRMD process, and it is related to the temperature gradients, 

because the density of the molecules rises in the distillation gap, and the motion of the particles in 

the distillation gap might causes isotropic behavior due to successive cracking of heavier 

molecules inner the thin liquid film.

both the temperature dependence of the liquid viscosity and the effects of evaporation. 

Analyzing the film thickness profiles, it was depicted a continuous decrease to 1x10

 m. 

This is explained by the in–situ reaction of the heavier pseudocomponents, the depletion of the 

most volatile of the pseudocomponents produced, and the temperature gradient in the liquid film, 

caused by the heat exchange between the inner surface of the evaporator, the reaction heat and 

the evaporation heat.

Figure 7 shows the variation in velocity at the evaporating surface. It can be seen that as 

the film thickness decreases at the outlet section of the evaporator, so the velocity decreases 

greatly. Figure 7 shows the development of the ?r along the evaporator length in r–direction. 

Given the dependence on the ?  in relationship with the ?r, the ?r profiles were affected by the 

presence of catalyst in the system. Thus, it is noted that low ?r values were reached at the outlet 

of the evaporator surface. However, along the radial distance, it is guarantying in this conditions, 

that a uniform thin film promotes high efficiency in the mass and in the energy transfers.

Figure 8 shows the simulated liquid concentrations under the different operational 

conditions between 423.15 K and 523.15 K, for the case studies with 3 and 5 %wt of catalyst. 

Consequently, the concentration gradient driving the diffusion of pseudocomponent “a” from the 

evaporator surface into the bulk decreases rapidly, and the reaction inside the liquid film becomes 

the predominant pathway for the consumption of pseudocomponent “a”, such that the molar 

fraction of the products formed (XNPSEb) increases. 

Analyzing Figure 8b for pseudocomponent “b”, the highest gradient concentration can 

be seen when EVT is equal to 483.15 K, which is associated with the cracking temperature at 3 

and 5 percent weight of catalyst. To illustrate the conversion of the pseudocomponents, Figures 

9a – 9b show that, under the operational conditions of the CRMD, the pseudocomponents “a” and 

“b” reacted and evaporated along the entire length of the liquid film over the evaporator surface. 

A gradually decrease in the concentration of pseudocomponent “a” occurred in the liquid film 

(Figure 8b). Pseudocomponent “b” reacted in the presence of the catalyst, and its concentration 

increased in the liquid film as shown in Figure 8b. This behavior indicates that both 

pseudocomponents “a” and “b” continue changing during the CRMD process, and are present in 

both the distillate and residue streams.

In the particular case of the upgrading of high–boiling–point petroleum fractions using 

the CRMD process, one can consider that the conversion of the feedstock (ATR–W) into lighter 

products per unit of feed at the outlet section of the evaporator surface, may be expected to vary 

inversely (for the distillate stream) and directly (for the residue stream) with the radial distance 

(RD) along the evaporator surface. In this sense, the extent of conversion (?D) of the ATR–W in 

the distillate stream can be defined as:

Where 
_a FNPSE

X  is the molar fraction of the

NPSE  in the feedstock. 

The extent of conversion (?R) of the ATR–W in the residue stream can be expressed 

approximately as 100 minus the conversion in the distillate stream (?D). 

Figures 9a – 9b show the profiles of the extent of conversion for five different 

evaporator temperatures (EVT). It is clear that, in the residue stream, the cracking reaction 

advances during the CRMD process (as the RD increases), and consequently the molar fraction of 

pseudocomponent "b" increases. The conversion in the distillate stream expressed the increase in 

the amount of reactants (NPSEa) consumed as the RD increased.

4.2.     Mathematical model verification  

Experimental trials were carried out to investigate the liquid yield and conversion in the 

distillate and residue streams (Tovar, 2012; Winter, 2011). Table 4 shows the conversions in the 

distillate and residue streams as well as the experimental and simulated flow rates of the distillate 

stream, and it can be seen that the model is able to predict the key parameters such as the outlet 

flow rates and conversion degree quite satisfactorily. 

Taking into account that the modeling approach is not exact, but approximate, its 

inaccuracy was evaluated by its approximation to the experimental data (Tovar, 2012; Winter, 

2011) (Table 4). The results were evaluated in terms of average absolute deviation (AAD%) 

which is defined as a relation among the absolute deviation of a predicted quantity divided by its 

experimental value (yi,ref). The absolute deviation is defined as the difference between the 

experimental value (yi,ref) and the response predicted by the modeling approach at each operating 

condition (yi,cal) as follows:

Consequently, the mathematical model gave a good representation of the experimental 

data related to the overall distillate mass flow rate (D) in the reactive centrifugal molecular 

distillation process since, the average absolute deviation (AAD%) was of 6.82% . On the other 

hand, the extent conversion in the distillate stream (?D) and the extent conversion in the residue 

stream (?R) reported an average absolute deviation (AAD%) of 9.39% and 14.32%, respectively. 

The results presented here clearly demonstrated that the mathematical model proposed 

was able to predict the performance and steady–state behavior of the CRMD process, presenting 

good agreement with the experimental data at the outlet section and providing theoretical 

guidance for the further experimental runs and process optimization. 

5.       Conclusions 

Verification of the mathematical model of the catalytic centrifugal reactive molecular–

distillation process was discussed in this contribution. Extensive pilot plant experiments for the 



 

355 

upgrading of a petroleum residue (ATR–W) were used to validate the performance of the 

centrifugal reactive–molecular distillation process in the outlet section of the evaporator surface. 

The results presented in this work clearly demonstrated the accuracy and reliability of the 

mathematical model proposed, since the average absolute deviation (AAD%) was no larger than 

6.82%, 9.39% and 14.32% for the distillate mass flow rate, the extent conversion in the distillate 

stream and in the residue stream, respectively. 

The simulation of the centrifugal reactive–molecular distillation process led to the 

prediction of the characteristic profiles in the thin liquid film in terms of the variables evaporator 

temperature (EVT) and percent weight of catalyst (%CAT). Simulated data showed the presence 

of temperature and concentration gradients in the radial direction. The higher distillate mass flow 

rates were obtained at the higher evaporator temperatures. Nevertheless, an increase in the 

evaporator temperature caused a distinct decrease in the effective evaporation rate. The 

performance of the CRMD process was checked by the degree of conversion of the feedstock 

(ATR–W), determined by the overall rate of the cracking reaction of the reactants in the liquid 

film. It was shown that the concentration of pseudocomponent “a” decreased and the 

concentration of pseudocomponent “b” increased along the flow path.  

The influence of the catalyst was analyzed. The results obtained showed that at 3 percent 

weight of catalyst, the centrifugal reactive–molecular distillation process worked under good 

operational conditions with a pressure of 41.6 Pa. Simulated data indicated a conversion equal to 

49.6% of feedstock in the residue stream and 65.6% of feedstock in the distillate stream when 

considered 3 wt% of catalyst and a evaporator temperature (EVT) equals 483.15 K.

Centrifugal reactive–molecular distillation: An intensified process–Part III 

High–boiling–point petroleum fraction upgrading using the centrifugal 

reactive–molecular distillation process with a catalyst: high–temperature 

simulated distillation to evaluate the conversion products (distillate and 

residue streams) 

Abstract 

Centrifugal reactive–molecular distillation (CRMD), an intensified process using 

reactive and hybrid separations, was developed and implemented by LDPS/LOPCA/UNICAMP, 

sponsored by PETROBRAS/FINEP. This work deals with the development of experimental 

methodology to accomplish the upgrading of a heavy petroleum residue by centrifugal reactive–

molecular distillation (CRMD). The experimental case study illustrated was a 673.15 K
+
 high–

boiling–point petroleum fraction of “W” crude oil (atmospheric residue ATR–W). The influence 

of adding a catalyst (1, 3 and 5 %wt) was examined. In this process, 30 fractions (15 distillates 

and 15 residues) were obtained under different operating conditions: the process temperature 

(evaporator temperature) range was from 473.15 K to 523.15 K and the constant feed flow rate 

was 1.473 kg·h
-1

. 

Due to the complex composition of the products obtained by CRMD, high–temperature 

simulated distillation gas chromatography (HT–SimDis GC), based on ASTM D 7169 using a 

capillary column, played an important role as an analytical technique to evaluate the extent of 

conversion and to characterize the converted products. The analysis of the AEBP distribution as a 

function of the evaporator temperature (or CRMD temperature) revealed that the CRMD process 

with added 1, 3 and 5 percent by weight of catalyst, produced lighter fractions in the distillate 

stream and generated important changes in the &gt;613.15 K analytical fraction when compared to 

the ATR–W feedstock (673.15 K
+
 high–boiling–point petroleum fraction).  Significant changes 

were found in the &gt;613.15 K and &gt;813.15 K fractions of the residue streams, reaching an 

conversion of the feedstock of about 50% when using 3 and 5 percent by weight of catalyst.  

Keywords: Centrifugal reactive–molecular distillation, simulated distillation gas 

chromatography, distillation temperature distribution, conversion, converted products.

1.        Introduction 

According to the literature and the Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum (ANP), 

crude oil and oil fractions with an API gravity above 31 are considered “light”, between 22 and 

31 are considered “middle”, between 10 and 22 are considered ‘‘heavy” and below 12 are 

considered “extra–heavy” (Canziani et al., 2009). Specifically, heavy and extra–heavy oils are 

characterized by a low H/C ratio, a viscosity larger than that of water, high molar mass 

hydrocarbons (asphaltenes and resins) and metals (Canziani et al., 2009; Rana et al., 2007). 

In view of this, there is a growing interest in the petroleum industry for research and 

development into alternative technologies for upgrading heavy feedstock (HF) (high–boiling–

point petroleum fractions and heavy oils) into high quality lower boiling point products with 

lower API gravity values, as well as a dynamic viscosity and molar masses of the lighter oil 

fractions as compared to HF, favoring the flow and transport properties. 

In this context, the reactive molecular distillation (CRMD) process has been developed 

by the Separation Process Development Laboratory (LDPS) and the Optimization, Project and 

Advanced Control Laboratory (LOPCA) of the Chemical Engineering School of UNICAMP, 

sponsored by the Research Center of Petrobras–Brazil (CENPES/Petrobras) and Brazilian Study 



 

361 

and Project Financing Institution (FINEP), aiming to improve the upgrading of heavy petroleum 

fractions and heavy petroleum crude oil. 

The CRMD process was presented in an earlier manuscript (Tovar, 2012), and in 

addition the modeling and simulation of the process were developed. The simulation provided 

useful data about the thin liquid film flowing over the conical evaporator surface inside the 

centrifugal reactive–molecular distiller, data used in the present study (Tovar, 2012). The CRMD 

process can be described as a hybrid intensified process, since it offers the “hardware” 

configuration and operating conditions which permit one to obtain a high vacuum, allowing the 

material to react at appropriate temperatures with short operating times, and ensuring very 

intensive contact with the surface of the catalyst. Therefore, according to the classification of 

Keil (2007) for intensified processes, the CRMD process can be introduced into this category as a 

consequence of the following features: 

• Operations at lower temperatures, leading to a better control of the desired products. 

• Higher rates of mass transfer due to the ability to expose the reactants to contact with the 

catalyst and to the process conditions. 

• Operating conditions favoring the cracking reaction in a single step process involving 

reaction– evaporation–condensation. 

• Flexibility of operating temperatures and pressures depending on the characteristics of the 

reactants, catalyst and products desired. 

• Multidisciplinary approach, which considers the coupling of both the separation processes 

and cracking. 

Using these special features, the CRMD process was applied in order to convert HF into 

lower boiling point products (corresponding to the distillate and residue streams), resulting from 

the subsequent catalytic reaction and evaporated compounds. Since not much information about 

processing high–boiling–point petroleum fractions using the CRMD process is available in the 

scientific literature, this work constitutes a great contribution to a better understanding of the 

CRMD process and its operating conditions. In this work, the experiments were carried out in the 

range of evaporator temperatures (EVT) from 473.15 K to 523.15 K, and the feed flow rate (Q) 

was fixed at 1.473 kg·h
-1

. The influence of adding a catalyst (1, 3 and 5 % by wt) was examined. 



362 

The main purpose of adding the catalyst was to accelerate the cracking reaction process, 

taking advantage of the high vacuum conditions. A heterogeneous catalytic system was assumed, 

this being a system where the catalyst phase differs from that of the reactants involved. In this 

process, fifteen (15) distillate fractions and fifteen (15) reactive–molecular distillation residues 

were obtained. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the CRMD process, they were characterized 

by high–temperature simulated distillation GC (HT–SimDis GC). 

1.1.     High–temperature simulated distillation GC 

Several methods have been applied to characterize and to determine the boiling point 

distribution (atmospheric equivalent boiling point, AEBP, distribution) of these materials (Adam 

et al., 2010; Boczkaj et al., 2011; Carbognani et al., 2007; Espinosa–Peña et al., 2004; Reddy et 

al., 1998). The distillation procedures, standardized by the American Society for Testing and 

Materials (ASTM) are summarized in Table 1.

2.        Experimental 

2.1.     Sample and catalyst 

For the experimental study, a Brazilian crude oil with an API gravity lower than 16 °API 

was distilled by conventional atmospheric distillation (ASTM D 2892, 2005), producing an 

atmospheric distillation residue (ATR–W). Thus, an atmospheric petroleum residue (11.9 °API, 

3.8359 at 343.15 K Pa.s) of “W” crude oil constituted the raw material used in the CRMD 

process, and was supplied by the Petrobras Research and Development Center (CENPES–Brazil) 

A heterogeneous catalytic system (refers to the form of catalysis where the phase of the 

catalyst differs from that of the reactants) was assumed using the zeolite–based catalyst CR–1 

(regenerated catalyst used for FCC technology containing 48.3 %wt of alumina, and particle size 

of 67µm). The influence of adding a catalyst at 1, 3 and 5 % by wt was also studied. The primary 

properties of CR–1 are listed in Table 3.

2.2.     Centrifugal reactive–molecular distillation experiments 

2.2.1.    Centrifugal reactive–molecular still assembly 

Figure 1a shows the device used for the CRMD process. A more detailed description of 

the experimental pilot plant was presented in Winter (2011). The centrifugal reactive–molecular 

still consists of the evaporator itself (Figure 1b) with an electric heating system and a cooling–

condensation system (dome). Two display glass ports are disposed in the condenser dome. Both 

the evaporator (reaction/evaporation surface) and condenser systems were constructed in series 

316 stainless steel.  

The conical surface rotates at an angular velocity of ? and the liquid is brought up to the 

cone surface along the radial length. The evaporator has a conical shape and the rotational 

movement is conferred on it by an electric motor. The use of the central rotational heated disk is a 

mechanical way of creating a thin liquid film uniformly distributed over the evaporator surface. 

The better half cone angle of the rotor was 70°, information obtained experimentally by Myers–

Vacuum (Myers–vacumm, 2010). This angle allows for good spreading of the liquid on the 

surface of the rotor, allowing for the formation of a thin liquid film that passes through the heated 

disk and makes contact with the condenser surface.

The construction parameters and operating conditions such as rotor speed, evaporator 

radius (defined as 0.26 m), distance between the evaporator and condenser (defined as 0.08 m); 

ratio between the condenser and evaporator areas, and condenser temperature (related to 

evaporation efficiency) were studied in Winter (2011).  

The module was completed by a vacuum system composed of a combination of several 

vacuum pumps in series, consisting of a mechanical pump (40 Pa) and a diffusion pump (0.1 Pa) 

(Figure 1e). The vacuum configuration contained valves and a trap system to retain volatile 

molecules arising during the process. 

The operational capacity was from 05 to 40 liters per hour and the temperature range 

between 298.15 K and 623.15 K. The feed and distillate product lines (distillate and residue 

streams) were made from series 316 stainless steel, equipped with check valves to allow for 

continuous feed/discharge of the materials.  

2.2.2.     The centrifugal reactive–molecular distiller operation 

The centrifugal reactive–molecular distiller operates in a continuous and steady state. 

After setting the flow conditions (Q) and evaporator temperature (EVT), the tests were started. 

The equipment was first operated using the control panel to reach the desired operational 

conditions, and approximately 2 hours were necessary to stabilize the system. The experiments 

were carried out based on the operational conditions described by simulated the results obtained 

previously using the DESTMOL–R (computational tool developed in FORTRAN–90 language 

using Compaq Visual Fortran compiler developed by Tovar (2012)). Figure 2 shows a sketch of 

the operation of the CRMD unit, and Table 4 describes the experimental conditions for upgrading 

the ATR–W using the CRMD where the catalyst CR–1 was mixed with the atmospheric 

petroleum residue, constituting the load to the CRMD process (a heterogeneous catalytic system). 

The steps of the distillation process can be described as follows: 

Feeding stage: The catalyst CR–1 was assumed mixed with the high–boiling–point 

petroleum fraction, constituting the load to the CRMD process. The material, which is kept in a 

storage tank with a heating system, is fed to the center of the evaporator at a pre–established flow 

rate using a gear pump. The evaporator rotates at a fixed velocity of 540 rpm, and the centrifugal 

force is responsible for forming a uniform thin liquid film that flows over the evaporator surface, 

set at the pre–established temperature (evaporator temperature, EVT).

Conditioning vacuum stage: The high vacuum in the centrifugal reactive–molecular still 

is attained using a mechanical pump. The system uses a bath to cool and condense the molecules 

in a collector system located behind the mechanical pump. Furthermore, the influx of the 

molecules of components evaporated into the free film surface occurs quickly as a result of high 

vacuum in the system (&lt;50 Pa). However, two types of molecules contribute to increase the 

pressure therein; these are molecules of the residual gas formed by atmospheric air which seeps 

into the catalyst, and any other gas which may be dissolved in the distilled mixture originally and 

the molecules of steam distilled. In this sense, the processing of a high–boiling–point petroleum 

fraction (ATR–W 673.15 K
+
) in a heterogeneous catalytic system with an ultimate goal of 

developing practical catalytic system for specific chemical transformations, causes a increases in 

the pressure system from 0.4 Pa to 28.6 Pa when it is added 1 %wt of a zeolite–based catalyst, 

from 0.4 Pa to 41.6 Pa when it is added 3 %wt of a zeolite–based catalyst, and from 0.4 Pa to 

50.0 Pa when it is added 5 %wt of a zeolite–based catalyst. 

Film formation and reaction–vaporization–condensation stage: The film is formed as a 

result of the distribution of the liquid sample on the conical surface of the evaporator, reaching a 

characteristic thickness of about 1x10
-4

 m. Having satisfied the essential conditions of the CRMD 

process (high vacuum conditions, thin film thickness and a distance between the evaporator and 

condenser to the same order of magnitude as the mean free path), the catalytic cracking reaction 

takes place and the phenomenon of vaporization of the volatile molecules begins. In 

heterogeneous catalysis, the reactants diffuse to the catalyst surface and adsorb onto it, via the 

formation of chemical bonds. After, the products desorb from the surface and diffuse away. On 

the other hand, the evaporated molecules travel through the evaporation gap to the surface of the 

condenser. 

Collection of the products stage: The products obtained (distillate and residue streams) 

are collected in a gutter concentric to the rotor and removed from the distiller. There is no need to 

break the vacuum to collect the products. The heaviest non–evaporated residue slides off the rotor 

into a collecting gutter. 

2.3.     High–temperature simulated distillation GC and ATR–W conversion 

The HT–SimDis GC analyses were performed using an Agilent Technologies 7890A gas 

chromatograph (GC) equipped with a temperature cool on–column injector and flame ionization 



368 

detector (FID). The suitable column temperature program and flame ionization detector 

temperature were established after several tests. The GC conditions used in this work were as 

follows: initial oven temperature, 313.15 K; rate, 10 K·min
-1

; final temperature, 703.15 K; final 

time, 5 min; total run time, 44 min. A FID system set at 703.15 K was used for detection. The H2, 

air and N2 (make up) flows were, respectively, 35, 350 and 30 mL·min
-1

.  The temperature of the 

column was programmed from 323.15 K to 703.15 K at 15 K·min
-1

.  

The products (distillate and residue streams obtained from the CRMD process) were 

diluted with carbon disulfide (CS2) at a concentration of approximately 2.0% by wt. High purity 

CS2 (purchased from Vetec, Rio de Janeiro – Brazil) was used as the solvent because of its 

miscibility with the samples, low boiling point and low response factor in the FID (Falla et al., 

2006). The samples were injected with an automatic injector (Agilent Technologies 7683 B 

Series) to maximize reproducibility. 1 µL of this solution was injected into a high–temperature 

silica capillary column (stationary phase of polydimethylsiloxane, 6 m in length, i.d. of 530 µm, 

and 0.15 µm of film thickness; from Wasson KC100). The analyses were carried out with a 

constant helium flow of 22.5 mL·min
-1

. The velocity of the carrier gas was 160.57 cm·s
-1

. 

A computer–based chromatography data system (Agilent GC ChemStation software, 

B.03.02) was used for the data acquisition. The SimDis curves were obtained using the algorithm 

defined in the ASTM D 7169 (2011) standard method using the SimDis software (AscentSimDis 

for netCDF A06.01 V1.012409) provided by Wasson–ECE Instrumentation. 

 2.3.1.     Calibration of retention time scale 

Calibration of the standards in the range from C5 to C110 was carried out using a n– 

paraffins mixture (C5 – C24) (Agilent technologies batch no. CE–1983, Catalogue n
o
. 5080–

8716), and poliwax (Poliwax 1000, Resket Corporation batch n
o
. A067718, Catalogue n°. 36227). 

The standards, obtained from commercial suppliers, were dissolved in CS2 to about 2% by wt. 

The calibration curve was verified using a reference standard (Reference gas oil ASTM D 2887, 

Agilent technologies batch n
o
. 248873). The resulting chromatograms are presented in Figure 3.

2.3.2.    Quantitation 

For quantification, the detector signal was integrated every 0.1 min. The blank analysis 

was carried out under the same conditions, and repeated periodically because of the habitual 

chromatographic baseline instability existing from sample to sample. The signal corresponding to 

the blank run was subtracted in the data processing using the SimDis software (AscentSimDis for 

netCDF A06.01 V1.012409). 

2.3.3.    Repeatability test of HT–SimDis GC 

In order to evaluate the repeatability of the group peak, the relative standard deviation 

(% RSD) with respect to the mean signal of each peak, calculated from three (03) consecutive 

repetitions of the Poliwax standard, ATR–W sample, D3–3% (distillate stream obtained from the 

CRMD process) and R3–3% (residue stream obtained from the CRMD process)  was examined. 

The values obtained, corresponding to the Poliwax standard, ATR–W, D3–3% and R3–3%, were 

lower than 5.8%. 

2.3.4.    Feedstock conversion 

The feedstock (ATR–W) conversion using the CRMD process was calculated from the 

fractions with boiling points of &gt;613.14 K and &gt;813.15 K, based on the yields for the liquid 

distillate (% Dyield) and liquid residue (% Ryield) (Reddy et al., 1998). Based on the work 

developed by Blanding (1953), the conversion, defined on these bases (% Dyield and % Ryield), is 

equivalent to 100 minus the mass percent of liquid material with boiling points above 613.15 K  

and 813.15 K according to the simulated distillation curve, obtained by HT–SimDis GC, as 

presented in Equations (1) – (2).

products had much lighter compounds, whilst the second GC peak, corresponding to the heavy 

fractions, had disappeared.

only showed one major peak, corresponding to AEBPs of about 616.15 K, 620.15 K, 628.15 K, 

629.15 K and 630.15 K, respectively.

One interesting aspect can be observed in the residue chromatograms presented in 

Figure 5b; the shape of the HT–SimDis gas chromatogram suggests that two regions can be 

considered. The first one, spanning from the injection point up to about 18.5 min, corresponds to 

lighter products. The other region (heavier compounds) starts at about 18.5 min and ends at 

approximately 38 min. Considering this paramount, the chromatogram of the residue products 

has lighter compounds and the second GC peak corresponds to the heavy compounds, eluting at a 

lower temperature when compared to the ATR–W HT–SimDis gas chromatograms (Figure 4). 



 

373 

Thus the HT–SimDis gas chromatograms of the R1–3%, R2–3%, R3–3%, R4–3% and R5–3% 

residue products (Table 4) contain two major peaks (Figure 5b). The first peak corresponds to 

AEBPs between 704.15 K and 815.15 K, and the second peak corresponds to AEBPs between 

981.15 K and 982.15 K. In the same way, analogous HT–SimDis gas chromatograms were 

obtained with 1 and 5 % by wt of catalyst, and similar trends were observed. 

Table 5 shows the AEBP distribution of the ATR–W and of the converted products 

(distillates and residues) obtained using HT–SimDis, and classified according to their boiling 

point ranges. The AEBP distribution in Table 5 reveals that both the distillate and residue 

products presented lower boiling point temperatures. Furthermore, in the case of the distillate 

products, most of the 813.15 K fraction was converted, reaching 100 % of conversion when 

compared to the products from the residue streams. Consequently, in the distillate products, the 

fractions between IBP (K)–613.15 K and 613.15–723.15 K increased significantly during the 

CRMD processing of the ATR–W between 473.15 K and 523.15 K (operational temperature, 

EVT). It is worth mentioning that the distillate products are clearly different from the feedstock. 

Nevertheless the residue products are also different from the feed, although at first sight, present 

similarities. Analyzing the distillate streams, it can be seen that between 473.15 and 498.15 K 

there is a significant change in the  &gt;813.15 K fraction, and in addition, an increase in EVT led to 

a significant conversion of the IBP(K)–613.15 K and 613.15–723.15 K AEBP material fractions 

into lighter fractions, when compared with the feedstock (ATR–W). 

Furthermore, it was revealed that the EVT (CRMD temperature or evaporator 

temperature) had a significant effect on the distribution of the residue products, particularly on 

the &gt;813.15 K fractions.  An evaporator temperature below 523.15 K led to a significant 

conversion (around 50%) of the 813.15–973.15 K AEBP materials, which means that increasing 

the EVT to between 473.15 K and 523.15 K leads to the production of considerable amounts of 

lighter fractions from the ATR–W feedstock. Hence, it was also possible to obtain the scenario 

for the CRMD experiments. The data from Table 5 show two interesting aspects with respect to 

the analyses: (i) some particular fractions such as:&amp;lt;723.15 K, 723.15–813.15 K and &gt;813.15 K 

can represent heavy, medium and light fractions, respectively; and (ii) cracking effects are 

induced by the catalytic reaction and evaporator temperatures (EVT). Thus the most favorable 

conditions for upgrading the ATR–W by CRMD must be carried out between 473.15 K and 

498.15 K using 3 % by wt of catalyst.

4.       Conclusions 

The HT–SimDis GC method was successfully applied to analyze the AEBP distribution 

of a heavy feedstock and of its conversion products after upgrading by centrifugal reactive–

molecular distillation (distillate and residue streams). The HT–SimDis GC analysis of the CRMD 

products and feedstock indicated that the centrifugal reactive–molecular distillation of ATR–W 

caused significant changes in the AEBP distribution of the &gt;613.15 K and &gt;813.15 K fractions. 

In the trials using 3 and 5 % by wt of catalyst, the yield in products with AEBP from 

813.15 to 973.15 K changed drastically in the distillate stream. The conversion of the fraction 

with an AEBP above 613.15 K decreased, reaching 65.6% (at 3 %wt of catalyst) and 64.3% (at 5 

%wt of catalyst), while the fraction with an AEBP above 813.15 K remained approximately 

constant when process temperatures between 473.15 and 523.15 K were used, reaching about 

100% of conversion. In the residue streams, the same fraction did not report any trend in the EVT 

range. At an EVT equal to 483.15 K, the fraction with an AEBP above 613.15 K was converted 

significantly, attaining about 49.6% (at 3 %wt of catalyst) and 53.1% (at 5 %wt of catalyst) of 

conversion. With such fractions, the CRMD process could be considered as an interesting option 

for high–boiling–point petroleum fraction upgrading, since it allows for a reduction in the boiling 

point of high–boiling–point petroleum fractions and presents high conversion rates under 

relatively mild conditions of about 483.15 K and 40 Pa.

8.3.     Considerações finais 

A modelagem do processo de destilação molecular reativa (tipo centrifuga–CRMD) está 

baseada na modelagem desenvolvida para o processo de destilação molecular centrífuga, 

previamente apresentada nessa Tese de Doutorado (Capítulo 6), porém sem consideração de 

reação química. A modelagem foi devidamente adaptada, com objetivo de fazer estudos de 

predição e também de avaliação do processo em estudo (CRMD), levando, com isso, à condução 

de trabalhos experimentais em condições já otimizadas e mesmo possibilitando, a priori, a 

verificação dos resultados que seriam conseguidos com uma aplicação experimental.  Equações 

de transferência de massa, energia e momento foram consideradas nessa modelagem.  A taxa de 

evaporação considerada foi a de Langmuir modificada levando em consideração a geometria do 

equipamento e o grau de anisotropia do sistema. 

O termo cinético reativo foi incorporado ao modelo e a equação da taxa de reação foi 

assumida como cinética de primeira ordem, tendo em conta, a influência do catalisador no 

sistema. Ainda assim, os parâmetros cinéticos foram determinados pela técnica termoanalítica, 

usando calorimetria exploratória diferencial (do inglês DSC–differential scanning calorimeter).  

Esta modelagem deu origem a um ambiente computacional, designado DESTMOL–R, 

capaz de predizer todas as variáveis do processo como: perfis de temperatura na superfície do 

filme, espessura do filme, taxa de evaporação efetiva, taxa de destilado, perfil de velocidade e 

taxa de reação. Em virtude da simulação do processo de destilação molecular centrifuga reativa 

pôde–se analisar o comportamento dos perfis das variáveis de interesse, através da manipulação 

das variáveis de entrada, da vazão de alimentação (Q), da temperatura do evaporador (EVT) e da 

porcentagem de catalisador (%CAT). O processo em estado estacionário mostrou que a 

temperatura do filme escoando na superfície (Ts), a taxa de evaporação (GE) e a taxa de destilado 

(D) são fortemente influenciadas pela temperatura do evaporador (EVT). Toda a energia 

consumida pelos pseudo–componentes que reagem e evaporam é suprida continuamente pelo 

calor fornecido na superfície do evaporador. 

Resultados obtidos das simulações apresentaram uma conversão da carga de 58% no 

destilado e de 42% no resíduo, considerando uma porcentagem de 3% m/m de catalisador na 

carga inicial e uma temperatura de processo de 483,15 K. As predições oriundas da simulação 

foram comparadas com os dados experimentais e indicaram um desvio relativo percentual médio 



380 

menor do que 6,82%; 9,39% e 14,92% para a taxa global de destilado, conversão na corrente de 

destilado e conversão na corrente de resíduo, respectivamente. 

Dados experimentais foram gerados através de uma metodologia experimental 

direcionada para processar (upgrading) um resíduo de petróleo pesado (ATR–W).  A influência 

da adição de um catalisador (1, 3 e 5% m/m) foi examinada. Em este processo 30 facções (15 e 

15 de destilados resíduos) foram obtidas em diferentes condições operacionais: a temperatura do 

processo (evaporador faixa de temperatura) de 473,15 K a 523,15 K, a vazão de alimentação taxa 

de 1,473 kg·h
–1

. 

Utilizando o método padronizado de análise por destilação simulada (ASTM D 7169, 

2011), foi possível analisar a distribuição de pontos de ebulição equivalente da matéria–prima, 

bem como seus produtos convertidos da destilação molecular centrífuga reativa (destilados e 

resíduos) e o grau de conversão destes com respeito à carga inicial no processo, existindo 

mudanças apreçáveis nas frações definidas como &gt;613,15 K e &gt;813,15 K. 

Para os testes experimentais utilizando 3 e 5% m/m de catalisador, o rendimento e 

conversão dos produtos na fração de 813,15 a 973,15 K muda drasticamente na corrente de 

destilado. Assim sendo, a conversão da fração maior de 613,15 K atinge uma conversão de 65,6% 

quando considerado uma temperatura de 483.15 K e 3 %m/m de catalisador, e uma conversão de 

64.3% quando considerado uma temperatura de 483.15 K e 5 %m/m de catalisador. Por outra 

parte, a fração com distribuição de ponto de ebulição superior a 813,15 K quando considerado 

temperaturas do processo entre 473,15K e 523,15 K, atinge cerca de 100% de conversão.  Na 

corrente de resíduo, não se apresenta uma tendência definida da conversão. Mas resultados 

importantes foram alcançados, conseguindo conversões entre 12 e 49.6% quando considerado 

temperaturas do processo entre 473,15K e 523,15 K e 3 %m/m de catalisador.

Characterization of converted products (distillate and residue streams) 

obtained from a petroleum residue upgrading using centrifugal reactive 

molecular distillation process: Rheological behavior, density, relative density 

and API gravity 

Abstract 

The objective of this work was to accomplish the evaluation of the centrifugal reactive 

molecular distillation (CRMD) process as alternative technique for upgrading of high–boiling–

point petroleum fractions and heavy crude oils. Experimental study is illustrated for an 

atmospheric petroleum residue (ATR–W 673.15 K
+
) within the process temperature (evaporator 

temperature) range from 473.15 K to 523.15 K at feed flow rate of 1.473 kg·h
-1

. The influence of 

adding catalyst to ATR–W at 1, 3 and 5 %wt was also studied. It was obtained 15 distillate and 

15 residues streams by CRMD process. They were characterized through rheological 

measurements. The experimental measurements were performed using a HAAKE RheoStress 

6000–UTC rheometer, with plate–plate sensor system constituted by two (02) parallel plates 

(PP35 and PP60) of 0.035 m and 0.060 m, respectively. Transition between non–Newtonian and 

Newtonian viscous flow was analyzed by flow curves at the shear rate range from 10 to 700 s

.  

Density, relative density and API gravity were determined by ASTM D 4052 (2009), ASTM D 

5002 (1999) and ASTM D 70 (2009) standard methods.  

Experimental results of products from CRMD process were compared with 

characterization performed for products obtained from centrifugal molecular distillation process 

(CMD) known as a non–catalytic process. In this sense, products obtained from CRMD process 

were found to exhibit Newtonian behavior at 333.15 K (distillate streams) and 393.15 (residue 

streams) when compared to CMD products which exhibited a Newtonian behavior at 372.15 K 

and 423.15 K, respectively.  Furthermore, it was clear the increase of API gravity data of the 

distillate streams. This can be explained since the CRMD process produces distillate streams 

which have a lower proportion of compounds with complex molecular structures when compared 

with residue streams which have compounds with features of resins and asphaltenes.

1.       Introduction 

Upgrading heavy crude oil and high–boiling–point petroleum fractions (bottom product 

from the atmospheric and vacuum distillation units) is essential in the petroleum industry. The 

heavy crude oils and high–boiling–point petroleum fractions exhibit API gravity lesser than 20° 

API, kinematic viscosity at 20 °C &gt;20 cSt (20 mm
2
·s

-1
), high dynamic viscosity from 100 to 

10,000 mPa·s and corresponding density &gt;950 kg·m
-3

 and can not be pipelined without previous 

treatment (Tovar et al., 2011; Martínez–Palou et al., 2011; Rana et al., 2007; Dehkissia et al., 

2004;  Lai and Smith, 2001). 

A hybrid and intensified process, named as centrifugal reactive–molecular distillation 

(CRMD) process, was developed and implemented by the Separation Process Development 

Laboratory (LDPS) and the Optimization, Project, and Advanced Control Laboratory (LOPCA) 

at the Chemical Engineering School of UNICAMP, sponsored by the Research Center of 

Petrobras–Brazil (CENPES/Petrobras) and Brazilian Study and Project Financing Institution 

(FINEP) (Tovar 2012; Winter, 2011). This technique, in which the molecular distillation and 

reactive processes are carried out concomitantly, is suitable for upgrading by mean of the 

cracking and split heavy crude oil and heavy petroleum residue with specific characteristic in 

relation with their low H/C ratio, sulfur and metals contents and complex hydrocarbon mixtures, 

as paraffins, naphthenes and aromatics.  



385 

The CRMD, defined as intensified process, refers to the development of processing 

technology to generate new products which could not be produced by conventional process 

technology due to its special operating conditions: lower pressure, lower temperatures, shorter 

residence times of the distilled liquid over the thermally exposed surface, a sufficiently small 

space between evaporator and condenser surfaces and more intensive contact between the sample 

and the catalytic surface than conventional catalytic process (Tovar 2012; Winter, 2011).  

In this process, two streams are generated: distillate stream (condensed molecules) and 

residue stream (non–evaporated molecules). Characterization of these materials, in terms of 

rheological behavior and density data will help to evaluate the performance of the upgrading 

process in front of different operational conditions as well as significance information in 

reference to application, and the optimum conditions for the efficient operation of centrifugal 

reactive molecular distillation unit. 

Thus, the objective of this study was to accomplish the evaluation of the centrifugal 

reactive molecular distillation (CRMD) process as alternative technique for processing high–

boiling–point petroleum fractions and heavy crude oils. The CRMD from an atmospheric 

petroleum residue (ATR–W 673.15 K
+
) was carried out at process temperature (evaporator 

temperature) range from 473.15 K to 523.15 K at feed flow rate of 1.473 kg·h
-1

. The influence of 

adding catalyst to ATR–W 673.15 K
+
 at 1, 3 and 5 %wt was studied (Tovar, 2012; Winter, 2011). 

In order to evaluate the efficiency of the technique, products obtained from CRMD process, the 

distillate and residue streams, were characterized through rheological measurements and density, 

relative density and API gravity by ASTM D 4052 (2009), ASTM D5002 (1999) and ASTM D 

70 (2009) standard methods.  

On the other hand, characterization of the distillate and residue streams from CRMD 

(catalytic process) was compared with the characterization presented for distillate and residue 

streams obtained by centrifugal molecular distillation (CMD) process described as a non–

catalytic process (Tovar, 2012). This comparison held assessing whether or not CRMD might be 

considered as a total or partial upgrading process of the heavy petroleum fractions and heavy 

crude oils into products (distillate and residue streams) with lower viscosity and density. 

Rheological and density data could be used to provide a strategy in reference to the transportation 

and exploitation of heavy crude oil and processing of heavy petroleum fractions.

2.        Experimental Methodology 

A Brazilian crude oil (W) with API gravity, approximately, 16 °API was processed by 

conventional atmospheric distillation (ASTM D 2892, 2005). Bottom product or atmospheric 

distillation residue (ATR–W 673.15 K
+
) constituted the high–boiling–point petroleum fraction 

fraction (feedstock) processed by CMD and CRMD processes (Tovar, 2012; Winter, 2011). 

2.1.     Centrifugal molecular distillation and centrifugal reactive–molecular 

distillation experiments 

The equipment used in the experiments was the pilot plant with an evaporation surface 

area of 0.1935 m
2
 built up and available at the Laboratory of Development of Separation 

Processes (LDPS) and Laboratory of Optimization, Design and Advanced Control (LOPCA), at 

the School of Chemical Engineering, State University of Campinas. A sketch of centrifugal 

reactive molecular distiller unit is presented in Figure 1. Table 1 describes the experimental 

conditions established to CMD (non–catalytic) and CRMD (catalytic) processes of the ATR–W 

673.15 K
+
. The distiller unit is basically comprised by a spinning rotor (540 rpm) with a disk in a 

high vacuum chamber. The evaporation occurs from the inner surface of the evaporator towards 

the external surface of the condenser. The distance between the evaporator surface and condenser 

surface is of 0.08 m.  Centrifugal force spreads the material rapidly over the heated evaporator 

surface homogenizing the film that is formed and allowing an easier heat and mass transfer from 

the inner layers (in contact with the evaporator surface) to the free film liquid surface.

Collector samples of CMD and CRMD are constituted by two vessels. Two product 

streams were generated: distillate streams rich in lighter molecules that escape from the 

evaporator and get the condenser surface; and the residue streams rich in the heavier molecules 

and remain in the evaporator surface. The vacuum system is a combination of several vacuum 

pumps in series; In the case of CMD process, this system consists of an auxiliary pump and a 

diffusion pump. On the other hand, in the CRMD process the mechanical pump is enough to 

attain the vacuum conditions. The vacuum configuration contains valves and a trap system to 

retain volatile molecules from process. In the experiments, a typical pressure reached in the CMD 



388 

process was in the order of 0.4 Pa and in the CRMD process the reached vacuum pressure was 

function of the weight percent of catalysts used in the experiments. Hence, typical pressure was 

between 29 Pa and 50 Pa (Tovar, 2012).   

2.2.     Viscosity analysis of distillate and residue streams obtained from CMD 

and CRMD processes 

The experimental measurements were performed using a HAAKE RheoStress 6000–

UTC rheometer (Thermo Electron Corporation, Karlsruhe, Germany), with a plate–plate sensor 

system constituted by two (02) parallel plates (PP35 and PP60) of 0.035 m of diameter (for ATR–

W 673.15 K
+
 sample and residue streams obtained by CRMD) and 0.060 m of diameter (for 

distillate streams obtained by CRMD). Characteristics of plate–plate sensor systems are presented 

in Table 2.

The rheological measurements refers to the analyses of transition between non–

Newtonian and Newtonian behavior obtained from an analysis of the flow curve prepared using 

the controlled rate mode and at the shear rate range from 10 to 700 s
–1

 with measurements being 

made every 10 s
-1

. All experiments were carried out using compressed air as an oxidizing 

atmosphere. Measurements were defined and controlled through HAAKE RheoWin Job Manager 

software (Version 3.61.0000). 

The procedure carried out in the rheological analyses is described in five (05) steps as 

follows (Tovar et al., 2011; Liñan et al., 2010): 

Step 1. Setting temperature of analyze. The flow behavior of the ATR–W 673.15 K
+
 and 

products streams (distillate and residue) was investigated over a wide range of shear rates at: 



389 

(i) 343.15 K, 363.15 K and 373.15 K for ATR–W 673.15 K
+
; (ii) 372.15 K for distillate 

streams and 423.15 K for residue streams from CMD process; and (iii) 333.15 K for distillate 

streams and 393.15 K for residue streams from CRMD process. The test temperature was 

maintained at a constant value and controlled to allow a maximum deviation of ±0.1 K with a 

HAAKE universal temperature controller (Thermo Electron Corporation, Karlsruhe, Germany). 

Step 2. Temperature stabilization system. The temperature must be kept constant during 

a time of 300 seconds, while the shear rate reached 10.00 s
-1

. This procedure allows a uniform 

allocation of the samples over the titan plate. 

Step 3. CS/CR–rotation step. The analyses were conducted in the CS/CR–Rotation 

Ramp tool available in the HAAKE RheoWin Job Manager software (Version 3.61.0000). The 

shear rate was increased continuously at a constant temperature from 0.00 s
-1

 to 700 s
-1

. 

Step 4. Rheogram. Typical rheogram in terms of shear stress and shear rate is depicted 

through HAAKE RheoWin Job Manager software (Version 3.61.0000). Then, the shear– and 

time–dependent rheology of samples can be determined and utilized to predict their behavior 

(Newtonian and non–Newtonian). 

Step 5. Evaluation data. The dynamic viscosity values were determined from simple 

linear regression through the set of 70 experimental data since they exhibit a linear relationship 

between shear stress and shear strain. Regression tool of HAAKE RheoWin Job Manager 

software (Version 3.61.0000) was used. In order to determine the Newtonian behavior, data must 

obey the general equation: 

u

y
? µ

?
=

?
 

(1) 

Hence, through this method, the relation between the shear stress ? and the velocity 

gradient 
u

y

?

?
 defined as shear rate can be obtained by Equation (2). 

? µ?=  (2) 

Where ? is the shear stress (Pa), µ is the dynamic viscosity (Pa?s) and ? is the shear rate 

(s
-1

). Using experimental data, when ? is plotted against ?, a straight line is obtained. With this 

linear relation, the µ is calculated from the slope of the straight line.

2.3.     Analysis of density of distillate streams 

The ASTM D 4052 (2009) and ASTM D 5002 (1999) standard method, for density 

measurements in the petroleum  industry, were used to determine the density and relative density 

at 20 °C (293.15 K) of the distillate streams obtained from CMD and CRMD processes. 

The tests were performed through the Density Meter DMA 4500 –  Anton Paar. A built–

in Peltier thermostat automatically ensured the correct measuring temperature at 293.15 K. A 

minimum of 1.5 mL is required.  Each sample required only 40 seconds for measurement and the 

results are automatically displayed.  

2.4.     Analysis of density of residue streams 

Experimental analyses were carried out using the pycnometer method follows the 

standard method ASTM D 70 (2009). Density (?
T
) and relative density (?r) of samples (residue 

streams obtained from CRMD process) were determined at 293.15 K. Density (?
293.15 K

) and 

relative density (?r
293.15 K

) of residue streams were calculated with Equations (3) – (4) as 

described in ASTM D 70 (2009).

3.        Results and discussion 

Distillate and residue streams from CMD (non–catalytic process) and CRMD (catalytic 

process) may be change from Newtonian at high temperatures to non–Newtonian behavior at low 

temperatures due to paraffins, asphaltene and other compounds. Hence, the basic parameter to be 

investigated in the rheological behavior is the dynamic viscosity (µ). The flow properties of the 

samples are usually illustrated using rheograms defined as plots of shear stress (?) and viscosity 

as a function of shear rate (?). 

The dynamic viscosity (µ) of the ATR–W 673.15 K
+
 sample was measured isothermally 

at a fixed temperature of 343.15 K, 363.15 K and 373.15 K and the results were recorded and 



391 

fitted to the Newtonian model (Equation 2). Hence, ATR–W 673.15 K
+
 found to follow 

Newtonian behavior based on the yield stress of the sample at 363.15 K and 373.15 K (Figure 2). 

It can be observed that the shear stress is proportional to the shear rate (Newtonian behavior) 

which mean that the dynamic viscosity (µ) is constant and independent from the shear rate at 

constant temperature (test temperature). Under these conditions, at 363.15 K and 373.15 K, the 

ATR–W 673.15 K
+
 sample has Newtonian behavior with values of µ of  0.7799 Pa·s and 0.4132 

Pa·s, respectively (Figure 3).

viscosity (µ) of the ATR–W 673.15 K

In Figures 4 – 5 are shown the rheograms of the distillate and residue streams obtained 

from CMD (non–catalytic process) and CRMD (catalytic process). The behavior of distillates 

streams obtained from CMD and CRMD (Figure 4) in experiments conducted at constant 

temperature and pressure has the following features: (i) the shear viscosity does not vary with 

shear rate; (ii) the dynamic viscosity (µ) is constant with respect to the time of shearing; and (iii) 

the stress in studied samples falls to zero (?=0.000 Pa) immediately the shearing ? is equal to zero 

(?=0.000 s
–1

). Therefore, with constant pressure and temperature (test temperature), distillate 

streams (both, catalytic and non–catalytic processes) exhibit a Newtonian behavior. 

The plots of ? versus ?  depicted straight lines, where the slope allows to calculate the 

dynamic viscosity at test temperature (µ
T
). Table 3 presents the µ values of each distillate stream 

obtained by catalytic and non–catalytic processes. Good straight line fits was determined since 

the linear squares correlation varied between 0.9998 and 1.0000.

When distillate streams from CRMD and CMD processes are compared, results 

indicated a decreasing in the test temperature to exhibit a Newtonian behavior. This indicated that 

the CRMD process has great influence on the properties of the products. In this sense, distillate 

streams from CRMD presented a Newtonian behavior at 333.15 when compared to distillate 

streams obtained from CMD which exhibited Newtonian behavior at 372.15 K. 

Dynamic viscosity (µ) is the quantity that describes a fluid of resistance to flow.  A high 

dynamic viscosity (µ) means that the liquid fluid will not flow easily and vice versa.  The 

viscosity values (Pa·s) versus shear rate (s
-1

) for the residue streams from CRMD and CMD 

processes displayed a Newtonian behavior in the range of the shear rates and temperature 

examined at 393.15 (for CRMD) and 423.15 K (for CMD) as presented in Table 4. Hence, it is 



394 

possible to affirm that residue streams are constituted by higher carbon number chains as 

discussed by Merdrignac and Espinat (2007) who confirmed that the high viscosity and polarity 

in petroleum samples may be related to the presence of complex compounds such as resins and 

asphaltenes.

Distillate and residue streams, obtained from CRMD process, were found to exhibit 

Newtonian behavior at 333.15 K and 393.15, respectively, when compared to CMD products 

which exhibited Newtonian behavior at 372.15 K and 423.15 K, correspondingly. 

As expected, the Newtonian behavior can be significantly affected by variables such as 

temperature and shear rate (Figures 4 – 5), as well as it is affected by molecular structure and 

molar mass distribution. It was found that CRMD process produces a progressive decrease in the 



395 

temperature which is reflected in the Newtonian behavior of the materials.  This indicates that the 

amount of catalyst in the process has a significant effect on rheological profile. 

Table 3 and 4 also register the density at 293.15 K, specific gravity (Brazilian standard), 

relative density and API gravity of the distillate and residue streams obtained by catalytic process 

(CMD) and non–catalytic process (CRMD). It is possible to confirm that the processing of ATR–

W 673.15 K
+
 through CRMD allows producing products with a remarkable difference regarding 

to products generated from CMD.  

Related to the density and API gravity, it is possible to observe a small variation of such 

property with the evaporator temperature and the weight percent of catalyst. Even though an 

increases in weight percent of catalyst stands for a difference in the density values and carbon 

number chains. Hence, the CRMD process represents a gain regarding to the increases of API 

gravity values when compared to the distillate and residue streams obtained from CMD process. 

Analyzing trials with 3 %wt of catalyst, it is clear that the complexity of mixtures is decreasing 

which might be ascribed to removal of higher molar mass species as confirmed in Tovar (2012). 

Nevertheless, results demonstrated that the components bearing a higher structural complexity 

are concentrated to the highest evaporator temperature (EVT), since the viscosity and the density 

data increased as the EVT rises.  

In this sense, the density values in distillate streams are lower than values of this 

property in the original sample (ATR–W 673.15 K
+
) and residue streams, which satisfy the 

objective of the CRMD process since it is a function of conversion degree and the difference in 

molar mass of the mixture (the larger the difference in molar mass, the separation will be greater) 

and depletion of the volatile compounds as the temperature of the film surface increases (Tovar et 

al., 2011). Nevertheless, the rise of the density in residue streams is due to the components 

bearing higher structural complexity are concentrated as the evaporator temperature (EVT) rises. 

Therefore, it is expected that the heaviest molecules with greater intermolecular forces and which 

did not reach the condenser surface are routed to the residue stream. 

4.        Conclusions 

Rheological profiles of the distillate streams obtained from CMD and CRMD process 

revealed a Newtonian behavior at 372.15 K and 333.15 K, respectively. Residue streams obtained 

by CMD and CRMD processes exhibited a Newtonian behavior over the temperature 423.15 K 



396 

and 393.15 K, respectively, since the dynamic viscosity (µ) stayed constant in front of the linear 

increase of the shear stress (?) as function of the shear rate (?).  

Concerning the density data of the distillate streams obtained by CRMD process, it was 

evident the low variation of these data with the process temperature (evaporator temperature). 

Nevertheless, significant differences were noticeable in the API gravities exhibiting an increase 

when the amount of catalyst rises. Under this assumption it is possible to affirm that the CRMD 

process might be performed to generate products (distillate streams) with carbon number chains 

lower than the initial sample with a noticeable improve in the physicochemical properties 

(density, molar mass and rheological properties). Although in residue streams the effects over the 

density data were not major, when compared with the distillate stream, it was clear a slight 

increase of API gravity data of the residue streams obtained by CRMD when compared with the 

residue streams obtained by CMD and initial sample (ATR–W 673.15 K
+
).  

In this sense, the CRMD process might be considered as a suitable strategy to partially 

upgrade heavy petroleum fractions and heavy crude oil due to: (i) the reduction in the 

temperature range in which products from CRMD evidenced a Newtonian behavior; (ii) the 

significant effects of the amount of catalysts in the density data of the distillate streams obtained 

by CRMD and, (iii) the minor increase of the API with the process temperature (evaporator 

temperature) when compared with values obtained for residue streams from CMD process and 

ATR–W 673.15 K
+
 sample.

Colloidal characterization of the fractions split using centrifugal reactive–

molecular distillation of a Brazilian atmospheric residue 673.15 K
+
  

Abstract 

Reactive–molecular distillation is presented as an alternative technique for the catalytic 

cracking and split of high–boiling–point petroleum fraction and heavy crude oils. The process 

was carried out in a stationary state using a pilot plant, obtaining two streams: the distillate and 

the residue streams. The technique was used so as to obtain 30 fractions with, from an 

atmospheric residue 673.15 K+ (high–boiling–point petroleum fraction) with 1, 3 and 5% by 

weight of the catalyst, under different operating conditions (Tovar, 2012).  

In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the process, the fractions (15 distillates and 15 

residues) were assayed by colloidal characterization using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) 

with UV–absorption detection, for the determination of the molar mass distribution (in the 

distillate and residue streams) and for the fractionation of asphaltene (in residue streams). 

The SEC analyses indicated a monomodal distribution of the fractions obtained by 

centrifugal reactive–molecular distillation (catalytic process), with a weight average molar mass 

(Mw) in the distillate stream ranging from 210 to 245 kg·kmol-1 with 1% by weight of catalyst, 

from 206 to 244 kg·kmol-1 with 3% by weight of catalyst and from 215 to 243 kg·kmol-1 with 5% 

by weight of catalyst. On the other hand, the Mw in the residue stream varied from 2554 to 2753 

kg·kmol-1 with 1% by weight of catalyst, from 2570 to 2908 kg·kmol-1 with 3% by weight of 

catalyst and from 2750 to 2806 kg·kmol-1 with 5% by weight of catalyst. The data were 

compared with those obtained for the fractions produced using molecular distillation (non–

catalytic process), where the Mw ranged from 192 to 337 kg·kmol-1 in the distillate streams and 

from 2537 to 3146 kg·kmol-1 in the residue streams. The results showed that the reactive–

molecular distillation process, involving the introduction of an in situ reaction in the separation 

process zone, led to the breakdown of the larger molecules into smaller molecules with lower 

molar mass. However, the weight average molar mass (Mw) and the asphaltene content (%A) 

increased with increase in the reactive–molecular distillation temperature (evaporator 

temperature). Such behavior demonstrated that the components with greater structural complexity 

were concentrated at the higher process temperatures.

1.        Introduction 

High–boiling–point petroleum fraction are characterized by containing molecules with 

more than 25 carbon atoms (C25), presenting structural complexity which increases as the boiling 

point, molar mass, specific mass, viscosity and polarity increase (Merdrignac and Espinat, 2007). 

The centrifugal reactive molecular distillation (CRMD) technique was developed and 

implemented by the Separation Process Development Laboratory (LDPS) and the Optimization, 

Project and Advanced Control Laboratory (LOPCA) of the Chemical Engineering School of 

UNICAMP, sponsored by the Research Center of Petrobras–Brazil (CENPES/Petrobras) and 

Brazilian Study and Project Financing Institution (FINEP), aimed at enhancing the performance 

of the heavy petroleum fractions and heavy petroleum crude oil (Tovar 2012; Winter, 2011). 

Centrifugal reactive molecular distillation (CRMD) is a catalytic–separation technique which 

uses high vacuum, reduced temperatures and short exposition of the material at the operating 

temperature (evaporator temperature). During the CRMD process, the liquid film is evenly 

distributed on the inner surface of the evaporator surface in the shape of a very thin film in which 

the thickness depends on the viscosity of the mixture and the feed flow rate. The breakage of the 

molecule (cracking process) takes places due to the very intensive contact between the sample 



401 

and the catalytic surface under the conditions of high vacuum and lower operating temperature in 

comparison with the conventional cracking process (&gt;658.15 K) as described by Tovar et al. 

(2011). 

Thus, the CRMD process represents the coupling of the cracking reaction and the 

centrifugal molecular distillation (CMD) process, in which the evaporating liquid film is formed 

due to the centrifugal force. The reactive centrifugal molecular distiller has a fast rotating 

spinning cone to create a fast spreading and moving film of liquid. When the rotating cone is 

heated, reaction/evaporation takes place. 

The cracking and separation of the compounds in the mixture inside the evaporator is 

carried out in five basic stages:  (i) Transport of the evaporated molecules from the feeding 

section to the evaporator wall; (ii) simultaneously breaking down of the heavier molecules into 

lighter molecules and distillation of the mixture; (iii) transport of the broken down and 

evaporated molecules through the distillation gap (space between the evaporator and condenser 

surfaces); (iv) condensation of the evaporated molecules and (v) the flow downwards of the 

distillate and residue streams towards the collector system (Zuñiga–Liñan et al., 2011; Liñan et 

al., 2010; Sbaite et al., 2006;  Batistella et al., 2000; Batistella and Wolf–Maciel, 1996, 1998).  

In order to analyze the breakdown of the heavier molecules into lighter molecules 

carried out by the CRMD process, as a function of the evaporator temperature (EVT) and the 

weight percent of catalyst (1, 3 and 5%), colloidal characterization was required. This refers to 

the dispersion of the entities (lighter and heavier molecules) in the distillate and residue streams 

obtained from the CRMD process. The main parameters that can define the colloidal structure are 

the molecular size and/or the molar mass distribution and the asphaltene content (%A), as 

determined by several techniques (Merdrignac and Espinat, 2007).  

Colloidal characterization with respect to the determination of molar mass has been 

carried out by vapor pressure osmometry (Liñan et al., 2010; Stubington et al., 1995), membrane 

osmometry (Zengin et al., 2007) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). However some 

authors reported the number average molar mass (Mn) and others the weight average molar mass 

(Mw). With respect to SEC, this technique provides information about the molar mass 

distribution of the compounds by way of calibration curves prepared using standards of the 

molecules found in the petroleum samples, and hence the weight average molar mass (Mw) and 



402 

the heterogeneity index (Mw/Mn), defined as the polydispersity index, can be determined (Evans 

et al., 1986;  Bartle et al., 1984). 

Size exclusion chromatography (SEC), also referred to as gel permeation 

chromatography (GPC), separates molecules according to their linear molecular size, based on 

their distribution between a stationary phase of controlled pore size distribution and a liquid 

mobile phase (Philip and Anthony, 1982). In SEC the retention is governed by the portioning (or 

exchange) of the molecules between the mobile phase (the eluent flowing through the column) 

and the stationary liquid phase that occupies the interior of the pores. Hence, longer molecules 

elute faster than shorter molecules (Meunier, D. M. In Settle, F.A.,1997). This technique has been 

used for synthetic polymers (Im et al., 2009; Karaca et al., 2009;  Šimeková and Berek, 2005), in 

the separation and fractionation of coal and coal–tar bitumen (Champagne et al., 1985), the 

separation of asphlatenes  (Sato and Takanohashi, 2005; Evans et al., 1986; Bockrath et al., 1979) 

and in the characterization of petroleum derivates (Morgan et al., 2010; Berrueco et al., 2008; Al–

Muhareb et al., 2007; Paul–Dauphin et al., 2007; Al–Muhareb et al., 2006). 

Accordingly, the present work aimed to develop a methodology based on SEC to 

characterize the distillate and residue streams obtained from the CRMD process in terms of 

colloidal parameters such as the asphaltene content and molar mass distribution, using 

conventional polystyrene standards and hydrocarbon standards structurally similar to the 

compounds present in the samples studied. The distillate and residue streams produced in the 

CRMD process were obtained in an evaporator temperature range (EVT) from 473.15 to 523.15 

K with 1, 3 and 5% by weight of catalyst, at a feed flow rate (Q) of 1.473 kg·h-1. Furthermore, the 

colloidal characterization of the products obtained from the CRMD process was compared with 

the results obtained for the 22 fractions (11 distillates and 11 residues) produced during the 

centrifugal molecular distillation process (CMD) carried out under optimized conditions in the 

experimental range from 423.15 to 603.15 K for the evaporator temperature (EVT) and from 

1.473 to 4.418 kg·h-1 for the feed flow rate (Q) (Tovar, 2012). 

The results allowed for the confirmation of the success of the CRMD process, since it 

led to the breakage of the larger molecules into smaller molecules with lower molar mass in the 

distillate and residue streams, as compared to the initial ATR–W sample and the products 

(distillate and residue streams) obtained from CMD (non–catalytic process).

2.        Experimental section  

A Brazilian crude oil (W) with a gravity of approximately 16 °API was distilled by 

conventional atmospheric distillation (ASTM D 2892, 2005), resulting in an atmospheric 

distillation residue (ATR–W). This ATR–W constituted the high–boiling–point petroleum 

fraction (raw material) processed by the CMD and CRMD processes (Tovar, 2012; Winter, 

2011). 

2.1.     Experiments with the centrifugal reactive–molecular distillation process 

The experiments carried out with the CRMD process are described in detail in Tovar 

(2012) and Winter (2011). The equipment used in those experiments was the pilot centrifugal 

molecular distiller (with an evaporation surface area of 0.1935 m2) available in the Laboratory of 

Development of Separation Processes (LDPS) and Laboratory of Optimization, Design and 

Advanced Control (LOPCA) of the School of Chemical Engineering, State University of 

Campinas, Brazil (Figure 1a). The centrifugal molecular distiller is basically comprised of a 

spinning rotor (540 rpm) with a rotational disk in a high vacuum chamber (Figure 1b). The 

distance between the evaporator surface and the condenser surface is to the order of 0.08 m.  The 

feeding system consists of a storage tank with heating facilities and a feed flow controller. A feed 

pump was used to control Q at 1.473 kg·h-1. 

The module has independent temperature controllers, which control the feed, evaporator, 

condenser and stream process (distillate and residue) temperatures. Accordingly, the EVT was 

controlled by an electrical heater system from 423.15 to 603.15 K, while the condenser 

temperature was controlled by thermostatic baths at 353.15 K. The sample collector of the 

CRMD process is constituted of two tube liners, one for each stream (distillate and residue), 

connected to two vessels. The vacuum system is a combination of several vacuum pumps in 

series, consisting of a mechanical pump and a diffusion pump. The vacuum configuration 

contains valves and a trap system to retain volatile molecules from the process. In the 

experiments, the typical pressures (28.6; 41.6 and 50.0 Pa) were function of the amount of 

catalyst used (1, 3 and 5% by weight), were obtained using a vacuum system consisting only of 

the mechanical pump.

2.2.     Experiments with the centrifugal molecular distillation process 

Centrifugal molecular distillation process from ATR–W was carried out in the unit 

available in our research laboratories (Figure 1). The process is described in detail in Tovar 

(2012). However, some important features of the experiments are briefly presented in this work: 

• The evaporator temperature (EVT) was controlled by an electrical heater system from 

423.15 to 603.15 K. The experiments were carried out at feed flow rate range between 

1.473 and 4.418 kg·h-1 and the condenser temperature was controlled by thermostatic 

baths at 353.15 K.  

• In the experiments, a typical pressure of 0.4 Pa was obtained by the vacuum system.

Both the CMD and CRMD processes generated two product streams named as: distillate 

(rich in the molecules that escape from the evaporator and reach the condenser surface) and 

residue (rich in the heavier molecules). Different operating conditions were studied. 

2.4.     Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) 

Apparatus 

The chromatographic system (VISCOTEK GPC/SEC TDAmaxTM) consisted of a 

VISCOTEK GPCmax VE2001 solvent/sample module, a VISCOTEK TDA 302 triple detector 

array, three GPC/SEC Phenolgel analytical columns (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) in series, a UV 

detector (filter at 340 nm) and OmniSEC software. 

Method 

The products (distillate and residue streams) were analyzed using size exclusion 

chromatography on three GPC/SEC Phenolgel analytical columns (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) 

with different pore sizes (50–100 Å), dimensions of 300 mm x 7.8 mm and packed with spherical 

styrene divinylbenzene copolymer beads with a particle size of 5 µm. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was 

used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.7 mL·min-1, and the column temperature was 

maintained at 313.15±1 K during the analyses. The samples were introduced through a 20 µL 

loop injection valve and detection was by means of UV absorption at 340 nm. The flow rate was 

measured continuously using a sensor and the detector interfaced to a data acquisition system. 

The SEC samples were prepared by dissolving each sample into THF and filtering the obtained 

solution by a Teflon membrane filter (pore size 0.45 µm). The molecular mass distribution with 

the number and weight average molar masses (Mn and Mw) and the polydispersity index (PID) 

were calculated by OmniSEC software. The environmental temperature was stabilized to prevent 

any changes in viscosity of the solvent. For this test, the laboratory was air–conditioned at 291.15 

K. 

Calibration 

The GPC/SEC analytical detectors used for the determination of the molar mass 

distributions were calibrated for molar mass versus retention volume using several polystere 

(PS580, PS1300, PS2497, PS5460, PS8864, PS12347, PS16953 and PS28500) and hydrocarbon 

(naphthalene, tetralin, carbazole, ammonium heptamolybdate) standards. Figure 2 shows the 



406 

calibration curve of Log (Mw) against retention volume for these compounds using THF as the 

mobile phase. 

This curve was fitted using a cubic equation (Equation 1) with a regression square 

coefficient of 0.989.

2.5.     Asphaltene determination by the gravimetric method 

The ATR–W asphaltene sample was precipitated from a ATR–W atmospheric petroleum 

residue 673.15 K+ by the addition of a 40:1 (v/v) excess of n–heptane, based on a modification of 

the ASTM 6560 (2000) standard test method (Gordillo et al., 2011). Briefly, 5 g of sample were 

mixed with n–heptane (150 mL), the suspension stirred with a magnetic mixer and boiled under 

reflux for 1 h, then allowed to settle and stored in a dark cupboard for 2 h, and finally filtered. 

The precipitated asphaltene, waxy substances and inorganic material were collected on the filter 

paper. After filtration, the thimble containing the filter cake was extracted in a Soxhlet apparatus 

(extractor system). The waxy substances were removed by washing with hot n–heptane in an 

extractor under vacuum at a rate of 2 to 4 drops per second.   In practice, the extraction was run 



407 

for 3 h, or until the wash was only slightly colored. The asphaltene dried in an oven at 373.15 K 

for 30 min. 

3.        Results and discussion 

Figures 3 – 6 present the SEC profiles of the ATR–W and the products obtained from 

the CMD process carried out in an EVT range from 423.15 K to 603.15 K and Q from 1.473 kg·h-

1 to 4.418 kg·h-1, and from the CRMD process carried out in an EVT range from 473.15 K to 

523.15 K (at 1.473 kg·h-1) with the addition of 1, 3 and 5% by weight of catalyst. The profiles 

were normalized between 0 – 100% for the UV signals (mV) to permit comparison of the 

retention volume segments of the curves. 

3.1.     Characterization by SEC of the distillate and residue streams 

The samples were dissolved in THF to give a final concentration of 1mg·mL-1. The SEC 

chromatograms of the distillate and residue samples obtained from the CMD process and 

normalized by area are shown in Figures 3 – 4 (Tovar, 2012). The eluent used on the GPC/SEC 

Phenolgel analytical columns was THF, with detection by UV–absorbance at 340 nm.

Figures 5 – 6 present analogous chromatograms for the distillate and residue samples 

obtained from the CRMD process using the same system of columns. In general, the distillate 

streams were presented as unfractionated samples, while the residue streams were presented as 

samples fractionated into asphaltene and non–asphaltene peaks, eluting both products with small 

retention volumes.

Figures 4 and 6 present the SEC chromatograms obtained for the residue streams. These diagrams 

clearly show how the fractionation process was effective in fractionating the larger molar mass 

material (asphaltene compounds) excluded by the column porosity. Furthermore, the earlier 

eluting SEC peak was shifted by approximately 12 mL (retention volume).

3.2.     Molar mass distribution of the products obtained from molecular 

distillation 

The distillate streams obtained from the CMD process in an EVT range from 423.15 K to 

603.15 K and Q from 1.473 kg·h-1 to 4.418 kg·h-1 were analyzed using the SEC method to 

determine the molar mass distribution of the products (Table 1). It was observed that the molar 

mass distribution of the liquids varied within a wide range. The number average (Mn) and weight 

average (Mw) molar masses of the liquid products ranged between 170 kg·kmol-1 and 241 

kg·kmol-1 and between 192 kg·kmol-1 and 337 kg·kmol-1, respectively. Table 1 also shows the 

polydispersity index (PDI), which reflects the deviations of the molar mass distribution from the 

Gaussian distribution of an ideal single compound (Ahmaruzzaman and Sharma, 2006).

On the other hand, the residue products obtained from the CMD process were found to 

have values for Mn and Mw ranging from 281 kg·kmol-1 to 2733 kg·kmol-1 and from 2537 

kg·kmol-1 to 3146 kg·kmol-1, respectively. Furthermore, Table 1 presented that the PDI values 

exhibited a wide range, which means that the number and weight average molar masses (Mn and 

Mw) of these products were not similar in nature to those of the distillate products, suggesting 

that the compounds in the residue streams were very different and containing high carbon number 

chains.

3.3.     Molar mass distribution of the products obtained using centrifugal 

reactive–molecular distillation 

The SEC chromatograms obtained are important to define the change in UV signal 

against molecular size in relation to molar mass. Each SEC chromatogram (Figures 5 – 6) was 

shown as a unique profile, depending mainly on the evaporator temperature (EVT) and the 

percentage weight of catalyst (% wt catalyst). The molar mass distribution data obtained by SEC 

for the distillate and residue streams generated by the CRMD process can be seen in Table 2. 

The molar mass distribution range for all the distillate streams was characterized by the 

non–polar asphaltenes materials. The experimental data showed that the non–polar asphaltenes 

corresponded to relatively small molecules with values for Mw between 210 kg·kmol-1 and 245 

kg·kmol-1 with 1% wt of catalyst, between 206 kg·kmol-1 and 244 kg·kmol-1 at 3% wt of catalyst, 

and between 215 kg·kmol-1 and 243 kg·kmol-1 at 5% wt of catalyst. The number molar mass 

averages (Mn) can be seen in Table 2.

The SEC chromatograms indicated that the distillate streams obtained from CRMD 

eluted later than the distillate streams obtained from CMD, indicating that these samples 

consisted of compounds with lower molar masses, which decreased as the sample elution 

proceeded. Furthermore, with respect to the CRMD process, it can be seen that the maximum 

chromatography peak moved from a high elution volume (19.087 mL) to a low elution volume 



412 

(18.156 mL) due to the removal and breakage of heavier molecules into lighter molecules, as 

compared to the distillate streams obtained from the CMD process. Thus, the decrease in molar 

mass may be ascribed to the removal of more and higher molar mass compounds. 

Interestingly, the distillate streams from CRMD were found to show a range of PDI 

values from 1.16 to 1.28, higher than those shown by the distillate streams obtained from CDM, 

which means greater differences between the minimum and maximum values for the molar 

masses in the former, presenting a wider variation in molar mass of the constituent molecules in 

the distillate streams obtained from the CRMD process as compared to those obtained from the 

CDM process. On the other hand, Figures 6a – 6c compare the SEC chromatograms of the 

fractionated residue streams obtained from CRMD with 1, 3 and 5% wt of catalyst, acquired 

using THF as the eluent with a GPC/SEC Phenolgel column and detection by UV–absorbance at 

340 mm. The sets of chromatograms excluded one peak from the samples, whose signal was 

found to be from a high molar mass compound (&gt;12000 kg·kmol-1) present in the samples. This 

peak was due to the presence of asphaltene–materials as described in the next section. 

The molar mass range for all the residue streams was defined by the asphaltene and non–

asphaltene materials. The experimental data showed that the values for Mw ranged from 2554 

kg·kmol-1 to 2753 kg·kmol-1 with 1% wt of catalyst, from 2570 kg·kmol-1 to 2908 kg·kmol-1 with 

3% wt of catalyst and from 2750 kg·kmol-1 to 2806 kg·kmol-1 with 5% wt of catalyst. The 

number average molar mass values are shown in Table 2. 

Furthermore, the average weight molar mass (Mw) data were compared with that of the 

initial ATR–W sample (before processing by CRMD). The results showed that the complex 

organic molecules were broken down into simpler molecules by breaking the carbon–carbon 

bonds in the precursors, since the values for Mw were lower than those of the ATR–W (Mw equal 

to 2956 kg·kmol-1) and of the residue streams obtained from the CMD processes, as presented in 

Table 2. Thus, on the basis of these results, it is reasonable to assume that the input variables, the 

evaporator temperature (EVT) and the weight percent of catalyst (% wt catalyst), had a great 

influence on the CRMD process from the point of view of the molar mass distribution.  

3.4.     Fractionation of the asphlatene compounds  

Asphaltenes were isolated from the ATR–W obtained by the atmospheric distillation of 

a crude oil (W).  Figure 7 shows a representative SEC chromatogram of the isolated asphaltene, 



413 

carried out using the above described series of GPC/SEC Phenolgel analytical columns. The 

elution volume corresponding to the maximum detector response was around 12.024 mL, and the 

average weight molar mass (Mw) of the asphaltene material isolated was 12,274 kg·kmol-1. 

On the basis of the SEC analysis of the asphaltene isolated from the ATR–W, the 

residue streams obtained from the CMD and CRMD processes (Figures 4 and 6) and the initial 

ATR–W sample were fractionated into two corresponding peaks, eluted using THF as the mobile 

phase, as shown in the SEC chromatograms in Figures 4 and 6.  

  
Figure 7: Area normalized SEC chromatogram of the 

asphaltene isolated from the ATR–W sample. 
Figure 8: SEC chromatogram of the ATR–W before 

processing by the CMD and CRMD processes. Peak A: 
asphaltene material; Peak B: non–asphaltene material. 

 

An analysis of the ATR–W sample shows that a clear fractionation of the asphaltene 

compound being a composite of the peaks A and B, defined, respectively, as asphaltene and non–

asphaltene materials, as shown in the SEC chromatogram (Figure 8). The first peak at a retention 

volume (Vp) of around 12.024 mL, corresponding to a valor for Mw of 12,274 kg·kmol
-1. The 

second peak at a Vp of around 13.000 mL, corresponded to an Mw of 1624 kg·kmol
-1 (Table 3). 

Analogous chromatograms were depicted for the residue streams obtained by the CMD and 

CRMD processes (Figures 4 and 6, respectively).   

Therefore, size exclusion chromatography provided a suitable technique for the 

quantitative and qualitative analyses of the asphaltene content, comparing the initial ATR–W 

sample with the residue streams: 15 fractions obtained from the CRMD and 11 fractions obtained 

from the CMD processes. The experimental data showed that the non–asphaltene material 

corresponded to relatively small molecules with Mw values of approximately 1,700 kg·kmol-1 



414 

(Table 3), which constituted the largest fraction of the residue stream, usually between 89 and 

92% by weight.  

On the other hand, the Mw values of the asphaltene material varied between 10,955 and 

12,050 kg·kmol-1 in the residue streams obtained from the CMD process; and between 11,638 and 

11,882 kg·kmol-1 in the CRMD process, depending on the weight percent of catalyst used. The 

asphaltenes constituted between 8 and 11 % by weight of the residue stream (Table 3). It is clear 

that the fractionation of the residue streams into asphaltene and non–asphaltene compounds must 

be used as a parameter to assess the effectiveness of the CRMD process as compared with the 

CMD process and with the asphaltene composition of the initial ATR–W (raw material), since it 

varies with the evaporator temperature, feed flow rate (in the CMD process) and the percentage 

weight of catalyst (in the CRMD process).

4.        Conclusions 

The SEC method developed presented a great potential for the characterization of the 

distillate and residue streams obtained from the CMD and CRMD processes. The simplicity and 

accuracy of this technique make it suitable for the colloidal characterization by way of the 

parameters of molar mass distribution and asphaltene content. 

A significant reduction in molar mass was found in the distillate and residue streams 

obtained from the CRMD process as compared to the products obtained from the CMD process 

and that of the initial ATR–W sample before processing. The average weight molar masses (Mw) 

of the distillate streams from the CRMD process were found to be between 210 kg·kmol-1 and 

245 kg·kmol-1 with 1% by weight of catalyst, between 206 kg·kmol-1 and 244 kg·kmol-1 with 3% 

wt of catalyst and between 215 kg·kmol-1 and 243 kg·kmol-1 with 5% wt of catalyst, as compared 

with a Mw range between 192 kg·kmol-1 and 337 kg·kmol-1 in the distillate stream from the CMD 

process. On the other hand, the Mw values for the residue streams obtained from the CRMD 

process ranged from 2554 to 2753 kg·kmol-1 with 1% wt of catalyst, from 2570 to 2908 kg·kmol-

1 with 3% wt of catalyst and from 2750 to 2806 kg·kmol-1 with 5% wt of catalyst. These data 

were compared with the results determined for the residue streams obtained by the CMD process, 

which ranged between 2931 kg·kmol-1 and 3146 kg·kmol-1. The higher polydispersity for the 

distillate and residue streams indicated a broader range of compounds of low and high carbon 

numbers, respectively. 

The SEC chromatograms showed that the residue streams from the CRMD and CMD processes 

contain asphaltene compounds,&amp;lt;10.57% by weight for the CRMD process and&amp;lt;11.54% by 

weight for the CMD process. However, the asphaltene sub–fraction in the CRMD process was 

lower than that in the CMD process, which constitutes an indication of the cracking of higher 

molecules into lighter molecules.

9.3.     Considerações finais 

Neste capítulo foram apresentados os resultados da caracterização físico–química 

realizadas nos produtos obtidos do processo de destilação molecular centrífuga reativa do resíduo 

atmosférico ATR–W 673.15 K+. Esta caracterização foi comparada com os dados obtidos para a 

amostra inicial e os produtos obtidos do processo não catalítico (destilação molecular centrífuga 

apresentada no Capítulo 6). 

A caracterização compreendeu as seguintes análises: 

• Fracionamento preparativo: Análises de destilação simulada foram realizadas para avaliar 

a conversão dos produtos. 

• Físico-química: Foram realizadas análises reológicas avaliando a faixa do comportamento 

newtoniano e determinação da massa específica e grau API para as correntes de destilado 

e resíduo. 

• Caracterização coloidal: Determinação da distribuição de massa molar pela técnica de 

cromatografia de permeação em gel (GPC), tanto para os cortes de destilado, como para 

os resíduos. 

Logo, o processo em estudo apresentou uma tecnologia de upgrading para óleo cru 

pesado e frações pesadas de petróleo provenientes da destilação atmosférica e a vácuo dado que: 

(i) foi reportado a redução da faixa de temperatura em que os produtos do processo evidenciaram 

um comportamento newtoniano, (ii) a diminuição considerável na massa específica dos 

destilados e leve diminuição nos valores de massa específica dos resíduos incluindo os efeitos 

significativos da quantidade de catalisador (3 e 5 % em massa), (iii) o leve aumento do grau API 

(e por tanto a diminuição da densidade) das amostras coletadas no resíduo quando comparados 

com os valores obtidos para os resíduos provenientes do processo não–catalítico (destilação 

molecular centrífuga) e com a amostra inicial (alimentação) e (iv) a redução significativa na 

massa molar encontrada nos destilados e nos resíduos obtidos pelo processo de destilação 

molecular centrífuga reativa quando comparado com os produtos obtidos com processo não–

catalítico e a amostra inicial.

Capítulo 10. 

Conclusões e sugestões 
 

10.1.     Conclusões 

 As conclusões específicas sobre os conteúdos característicos de cada capítulo foram 

descritas ao final de cada um deles e no desenvolvimento do mesmo (manuscrito(s) a ser 

submetido(s), aceito e/ou apresentado(s)). Consequentemente, a seguir apresentam–se as 

conclusões gerais inerentes aos desenvolvimentos descritos neste relatório. 

Foram desenvolvidas duas abordagens para a caracterização de frações pesadas baseadas 

nos conceitos de pseudocomponente e da termodinâmica contínua através de uma modelagem 

computacional na linguagem FORTRAN, visando seu acoplamento na modelagem matemática e 

a simulação do processo de destilação molecular reativa. A implementação computacional para a 

caracterização de frações de petróleo apresentou um resultado bastante condizente com o 

esperado, tendo inclusive boa predição com um desvio médio menor do que 10%. 

Nos capítulos subsequentes foi apresentada uma profunda revisão de conceitos inerentes 

ao processo de destilação molecular. Portanto, foi realizada uma descrição teórica do processo de 

destilação molecular baseada nas variáveis que descrevem a fase vapor tais como: o livre 

percurso médio, o número de Knudsen e a taxa de evaporação efetiva, envolvendo as condições 

operacionais da destilação molecular (temperatura do evaporador e pressão do sistema). A 

simulação numérica destes parâmetros mostrou que as principais características da destilação 

molecular estão relacionadas com a distância entre as superfícies do evaporador e do condensador 

e a pressão do sistema. A última inferência está relacionada com o número de Knudsen (0,01&amp;lt;Kn 

&lt;3), e os resultados das simulações demonstraram que para distâncias entre o evaporador e o 

condensador de 0,08 m e 0,05 m, se estabelece um padrão de fluxo similar ao fluxo molecular 

característico desse processo.  

Utilizando a fluidodinâmica computacional (do inglês computational fluid dynamics – 

CFD), foi realizada a caracterização em termos do regime de fluxo e das condições operacionais 

do processo. Foi analisado o escoamento do filme de líquido que se encontrava distribuído 



422 

uniformemente na parede interna da superfície de evaporador de acordo com o processo de 

destilação molecular centrífuga. As equações do modelo foram resolvidas no software comercial 

ANSYS CFX (de Ansys Inc., EUROPE). Para isso, considerações foram baseadas nas equações 

de continuidade, de Navier–Stokes e equações de modelos de turbulência (k–? e Shear Stress 

Transport k–?’). No entanto, pequenas diferenças entre os resultados obtidos com modelos de 

turbulência e laminar foram encontrados. Assim, o modelo de fluxo laminar é aceitável para a 

modelagem do processo de destilação molecular centrífugo. 

Dando continuidade ao desenvolvimento da tese, foi desenvolvida uma ferramenta 

computacional para auxiliar na modelagem e simulação do processo de destilação molecular 

centrífugo. O modelo desenvolvido foi baseado na contribuição feita por Inuzuka et al. (1986), 

Inuzuka et al. (1989) e Bruin (1969). No desenvolvimento da modelagem foi considerada a taxa 

de evaporação efetiva descrita pela equação modificada de Langmuir–Knudsen no trabalho de 

Kawala e Dakiniewicz (2002). 

Com os resultados da simulação do processo, apresentou–se que as variáveis de saída 

como a temperatura do filme na superfície do evaporador, a taxa de vaporação efetiva, a taxa de 

destilado e a espessura do filme, foram fortemente influenciadas pela temperatura do evaporador 

(temperatura da destilação). Assim, constatou–se que existe uma diminuição da concentração de 

componentes voláteis no filme com o aumento da taxa de evaporação efetiva em direção radial 

(raio do evaporador) e, portanto, se tem uma diminuição na espessura do filme na mesma direção. 

Uma vez definida a parte de modelagem sem reação, necessitou–se implementar uma  

modelagem que levasse em conta a reação de craqueamento. Assim, adaptou–se a modelagem do 

processo de destilação molecular centrífugo incluindo o termo cinético. Finalmente, equações de 

transferência de massa, energia, momento e a equação de difusão do componente i–th foram 

consideradas nesta modelagem.  A taxa de evaporação avaliada para essa modelagem foi a efetiva 

de Langmuir, levando em consideração os efeitos da fase vapor e o grau de anisotropia do 

sistema. A equação da taxa de reação foi assumida como sendo de primeira ordem levando em 

conta o efeito do catalisador.  

A calorimetria exploratória diferencial, técnica termoanalítica, do inglês DSC 

(Differential scanning calorimetry) foi usada com o objetivo de verificar as transições físico–

químicas que acontecem no processo de craqueamento das frações de petróleo (resíduos 



 

423 

atmosféricos ATR–W e ATR–Z). Também foi estudado o efeito da adição de um catalisador nos 

parâmetros cinéticos (energia de ativação, fator pré–exponencial e ordem da reação).  

Foram utilizados métodos para calcular os parâmetros cinéticos a partir da análise dos 

dados obtidos com a técnica termoanalítica, a calorimetria exploratória diferencial (DSC). O 

estudo mostrou que as taxas de craqueamento das frações pesadas foram dependentes da 

temperatura entre 693,15 e 723,15 K, identificando uma região endotérmica. O método de 

Kissinger e o método de Arrhenius foram aplicados para calcular os parâmetros cinéticos. Estes 

parâmetros foram determinados a partir da inclinação e intercepção da equação de regressão 

linear. Os métodos de Arrhenius e Kissinger permitiram a determinação simultânea de energia de 

ativação, o fator pré–exponencial considerando uma ordem de reação n=1. Portanto, conclui–se 

que a reação de craqueamento a ser incluída no termo cinético da modelagem reativa pode ser 

considerada como uma reação de primeira ordem (pseudo–reação de primeira ordem). 

Neste estudo, o efeito da adição de catalisador (3, 5 e 10% m/m) nos parâmetros 

cinéticos também foi estudado. A adição de catalisador aumentou as taxas de reação e forneceu  

um outro mecanismo reacional, estabelecendo um decaimento exponencial da energia de ativação 

para a reação de craqueamento em todos os sistemas estudados. 

A determinação de parâmetros cinéticos também foi avaliada utilizando a análise do 

efeito de compensação cinética, que se verificou pela existência linear entre o logaritmo do fator 

pré–exponencial e a energia de ativação.  Considerando o fato de que os parâmetros cinéticos 

exibem efeitos de compensação, foi avaliada a dependência da energia de ativação com a 

conversão ?, (E = E (?)). Com isso, é de se esperar que os valores do logaritmo Neperiano do 

fator pré–exponencial (ln A) se incremente devido ao incremento da energia de ativação (E). Este 

efeito resulta então na mudança dos parâmetros de Arrhenius, que é compensado pela mudança 

correspondente dos parâmetros de compensação (a* e b*). 

Nesta fase do trabalho, também foi desenvolvida uma ferramenta computacional na 

linguagem FORTRAN no qual foram incorporadas a modelagem e a simulação do processo de 

destilação molecular centrífuga reativa. O modelo matemático estive constituído por 11+18N 

equações diferencias parciais e algébricas conformado por equações de balance de massa, 

energia, quantidade de movimento, equação de difusão e a taxa de evaporação efetiva de 

Langmuir (para representar o fenômeno de evaporação). A equação da taxa de reação foi 



424 

assumida como sendo de primeira ordem levando em conta o efeito do catalisador. O modelo 

matemático foi resolvido utilizando o método numérico chamado método das linhas. Portanto, 

permitiu–se determinar a influência das variáveis de entrada do processo como temperatura do 

evaporador, de alimentação, velocidade do rotor, temperatura de alimentação, temperatura do 

condensador e porcentagem de catalisador sob a taxa de destilado e o grau de conversão no 

destilado e no resíduo. 

Análises e estudos estatísticos foram realizados com o objetivo de avaliar a influência 

das variáveis operacionais do processo de destilação molecular centrífuga reativa. Assim, foi 

realizada uma série de simulações projetadas num planejamento de Placket Burman – PB 16 e 

num planejamento fracionário de resolução IV (2IV
4–1

), com os que se conseguiram definiram as 

variáveis de maior influência (EVT, %CAT) nas variáveis respostas. 

A simulação do processo de destilação molecular centrífuga reativa permitiu descrever o 

efeito da temperatura do evaporador e da porcentagem de catalisador. Dados simulados 

apresentaram a presença de gradientes de temperatura e concentração ao longo da distancia radial 

do evaporador. A taxa de destilado aumenta conforme a temperatura do evaporador aumenta. No 

entanto, o incremento na temperatura do evaporador causa a diminuição da taxa de evaporação 

efetiva como consequência da contínua e rápida transformação de compostos pesados em 

compostos mais leves aumentando a quantidade destes. 

O processo em estudo foi avaliado em termos do grau de conversão da mistura reacional, 

determinada pela taxa global de craqueamento dos reagentes no filme de líquido escoando sobre 

a superfície do evaporador. Neste sentido, os pseudo–componentes “a” e “b” reagem e evaporam 

ao longo da superfície cônica do evaporador. Analisando os perfis dos componentes, conclui–se 

que a concentração do pseudo–componente “a” decresce gradualmente no filme de líquido 

destilante. Por outra parte, o pseudo–componente “b” reage e evapora em presença do catalisador 

e sua concentração se incrementa, estando presente em maior proporção na corrente de resíduo  

do processo. Portanto, os perfis dos pseudo–componentes “a” e “b” permanecem cambiando 

continuamente durante o processo de destilação molecular centrífuga reativa, constituindo as 

duas correntes principais: o destilado e o resíduo. 

A influência do catalisador também foi analisada. Os resultados apresentaram que 

utilizando 3% em massa de catalisador, é possível atingir condições favoráveis para o processo de

destilação molecular reativa favorecendo–se a conversão da alimentação. Dados experimentais e 

simulados indicaram que as melhores condições, para atingir uma conversão entre 15.2% e 

41.6% na corrente de resíduo e entre 58.4% e 84.9% na corrente de destilado do processo de 

destilação molecular centrífuga reativa são: uma temperatura de processo (temperatura do 

evaporador) entre 473,15 K e 483,15 K; 3% m/m de catalisador e 1,473 kg·h
–1

. Logo, o alto 

vácuo (entre 29 Pa e 50 Pa) e a presença do catalisador (entre 3 %m/m e 5% m/m de catalisador) 

aumenta a velocidade da reação de craqueamento, atuando como promotor de uma nova rota de 

reação com uma menor energia de ativação. 

O desenvolvimento de um modelo validado utilizando a ferramenta computacional 

(DESTMOL–R) projetada para complementar o processo de destilação molecular centrífugo 

reativo, se realizou através da avaliação dos produtos convertidos obtidos no processo (os 

destilados e os resíduos) em diferentes condições operacionais. Assim, o método padronizado de 

análise por destilação simulada (ASTM D 7169, 2011) foi aplicada com sucesso para analisar a 

distribuição de pontos de ebulição equivalente da matéria–prima, bem como seus produtos de 

processamento de destilação reativa centrífuga molecular (destilados e resíduos) e o grau de 

conversão destes com respeito à carga inicial no processo. 

As predições oriundas da simulação foram comparadas com os dados experimentais e 

indicaram um desvio relativo percentual médio menor do que 6,82%; 9,39% e 14,92% para a taxa 

global de destilado, conversão na corrente de destilado e conversão na corrente de resíduo, 

respectivamente, o que é valioso, considerando–se a complexidade do processo e da mistura 

sendo tratada. Assim, conclui–se que o modelo desenvolvido mostrou–se adequado para 

descrever os processos de reação – separação na destilação molecular reativa fornecendo 

orientação teórica para o desenvolvimento experimental e a futura otimização do processo. 

  O alcance do processo de destilação molecular centrífuga reativa foi confirmado com 

as posteriores caracterizações realizadas nos produtos obtidos. Assim, o processo em estudo 

apresenta uma rota de processamento efetiva para óleo cru pesado e frações pesadas de petróleo 

provenientes da destilação atmosférica e a vácuo dado que: (i) foi reportada a redução da faixa de 

temperatura em que os produtos do processo evidenciaram um comportamento newtoniano, (ii) a 

diminuição considerável na massa específica dos destilados e leve diminuição nos valores de 

massa específica dos resíduos incluindo os efeitos significativos da quantidade de catalisador (3 e 



426 

5 % em massa), (iii) o leve aumento do grau API (e por tanto a diminuição da massa específica) 

das amostras coletadas no resíduo quando comparados com os valores obtidos para os resíduos 

provenientes do processo não–catalítico (destilação molecular centrífuga) e com a amostra inicial 

(alimentação). 

O método cromatográfico por exclusão de tamanho (com siglas em inglês SEC – Size 

exclussion cromatography) apresentou–se como de grande potencial para a caracterização dos 

destilados e dos resíduos obtidos dos processos catalíticos e não–catalíticos apresentados nesta 

tese. A simplicidade e precisão desta técnica o tornam adequado para a caracterização coloidal 

por meio dos parâmetros da distribuição de massa molar e teor de asfaltenos. Uma redução 

significativa na massa molar foi encontrada nos destilados e nos resíduos obtidos pelo processo 

de destilação molecular centrífuga reativa em relação aos produtos obtidos a partir do processo 

não–catalítico e da amostra inicial. 

10.2.     Sugestões para trabalhos futuros 

As sugestões apresentadas para continuidade do trabalho estão descritas para o 

desenvolvimento teórico (modelagem e simulação) e experimental do processo de destilação 

molecular centrífuga reativa, como segue: 

 Desenvolvimento computacional 

• Desenvolver a modelagem do processo de destilação molecular centrífuga reativa 

em catálise homogênea. 

• Desenvolver a modelagem do processo de destilação molecular de filme 

descendente (em catálise homogênea e heterogênea). 

• Definir um termo de reação mais robusto com o intuito de predizer a conversão de 

diferentes frações. 

• Avaliar e introduzir na modelagem o efeito da pressão residual na taxa de 

evaporação efetiva (GE) 

Desenvolvimento experimental 

• Estudar o processo de destilação molecular em catálise homogênea e heterogênea, 

na configuração de filme descendente. 



 

427 

• Desenvolver outros resíduos pesados de petróleo com características diversas 

(composição, °API, propriedades reológicas). 

• Estudar o processo de destilação molecular centrífuga reativa com adição de 

solventes (tetralina, decano, nafteno e metil nafteno) permitindo a desagregação 

dos asfaltenos e como conseqüência os resíduos de petróleo sofrerão alterações 

físico químicas. O desenvolvimento desse trabalho está sendo realizado pela Dr
a
. 

Melina Savioli Lopes (Pós–doutoranda). 

Projeto do equipamento 

• Dispor de um mecanismo de alimentação direto sob a parte central da superfície 

do evaporador aproveitando o efeito da força gravidade. 

• Modificar o controlador da pressão da bomba mecânica. 

• Incluir um sistema de agitação com múltiples turbinas de pás inclinadas no tanque 

de alimentação.
