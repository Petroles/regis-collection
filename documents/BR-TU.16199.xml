This investigation was performed with samples from a lead–zinc sulphide deposit aiming at studying the
influence of the dispersion degree of the particles in the pulp on lead and zinc flotation. Samples of ore
and also of the minerals sphalerite, galena, pyrite, and dolomite were selected for the experiments. Nine
types of dispersing agents and six blends among them were employed.

A set of three dispersing agents was selected for the lead flotation and another set of three was chosen
for zinc flotation. The criteria for the reagents selection were: high dispersion degree for galena and low
for the other species, high dispersion degree for sphalerite and low for the other species, low dispersion
degree for pyrite and high for the other species, and high dispersion degree for all species.

Lead flotation experiments were performed under three conditions aiming at verifying the influence of
the dispersing agent, of the pH, and of sodium carbonate. The zinc flotation tests were carried out at pH
10.5, modulated with lime.

The use of dispersing agents in lead flotation did not improve the overall efficiency of the circuit for,
despite improving the lead metallurgical recovery, they increase significantly the zinc losses in the lead
concentrate.

Sodium carbonate presented a low dispersion degree and did not affect the lead flotation results when
compared with those achieved at natural pH and at pH 9.8 modulated with lime.

Two dispersing agents were particularly effective in zinc flotation: dispersant 3223, a sodium polyac-
rylate, and sodium hexametaphosphate. Both reagents significantly enhanced zinc recovery without
impairing the concentrate quality.

1. Introduction

Votorantim Metais operates an underground mine in Paracatu,
MG, Brazil, producing 1 ? 106 tonnes of ROM at 4.3% zinc grade
and 2.0% lead grade. Lead flotation consists of rougher and cleaner
column flotation stages and scavenger stage performed in mechan-
ical cells. The lead circuit tailings feed the zinc circuit consisting of
rougher and cleaner column flotation and scavenger and recleaner
stages in mechanical cells. The middlings from the flotation circuit
(cleaner tailings and scavenger concentrate) are reground aiming
at further sphalerite liberation. The production of lead concentrate
in 2007 was 26,000 tonnes at 62% lead grade and 82.5% lead recov-
ery. The production of zinc concentrate was 83,000 tonnes at 45.5%
zinc grade and 89.0% zinc recovery.

The correlation between the dispersion degree of the particles
in the pulp and flotation performance is well known in iron ores

cationic reverse flotation, where quartz particles must be disperse
and selective flocculation of iron oxides is desirable and actually
occurs. The system under investigation is much more complex
regarding either mineralogy or flotation stages requirements. In
the lead circuit, the dispersion of galena particles is essential. The
aggregation of the other minerals (sphalerite, pyrite, and dolo-
mite), that are expected to report to the tailings, may even improve
the selectivity of the stage. The same approach applies to the zinc
circuit: sphalerite particles must be disperse and aggregation of
pyrite and dolomite might favour the rejection of these species
to the tailings.

Many decades of investigation were necessary in order that
some correlations between dispersion and flotation performance
in iron ores reverse cationic flotation were established (Peres and
Silva, 1994; Peres et al., 2003; Queiroz et al., 2005).

The flotation of silicate zinc minerals, willemite and hemi-
morphite, relies on adequate dispersion of the ore particles in the
pulp. Highly disperse pulps eliminate the need for desliming, but
no direct correlation between dispersion and flotation is observed.
The most effective dispersants not always lead to the best flotation
performances Peres et al., 1994; Pereira and Peres, 2005).

This study aims at addressing the dispersion degree of the par-
ticles in a lead–zinc sulphide ore pulp as a tool for better under-
standing the flotation behaviour.

2. Literature review

Desliming preceding flotation is an industrial practice estab-
lished over 60 years ago, introduced in the USBM process for the
iron ores cationic reverse flotation (Clemmer, 1947). A high disper-
sion degree of the particles in the pulp is essential for effective des-
liming, a requisite for the selectivity in most non-sulphide flotation
systems. Desliming stages are not generally performed in sulphide
minerals flotation systems. One exception is the Mt. Keith concen-
trator (Western Australia), where desliming is done on a nickel sul-
phide ore.

The theoretical aspects of ultrafine particles aggregation and
dispersion are addressed by the DLVO theory, independently
developed by the Russians Derjaguin and Landau and the Dutch
Vervey and Overbeek, in the last century forties decade. After 50
years the classical DLVO theory was reviewed, incorporating struc-
tural forces suggested by Churaev and Derjaguin (1985), resulting

in the extended DLVO theory or X-DLVO (Israelachvili, 1991; Lins
and Adamian, 2000).

The concepts of the X-DLVO theory apply to the flotation pro-
cess (Yoon, 1991). Flotation may be seen as the interaction be-
tween two ‘‘particles”: ore and bubble.

There is an interrelation between dispersion and depressant ac-
tion in systems involving mineral pulps.

Among dispersing/depressant inorganic agents, polyphosphates
play a special role, and among organic species low molecular
weight acrylate polymers deserve special attention.

Rashchi and Finch (2000) investigated the chemistry and appli-
cations of polyphosphates, stressing that the metal ions-poliphos-
phate complexes formation may control the interfering ions action
in the flotation process, preventing uncontrolled activation or
depression effects.

Pereira and Peres (1988) investigated the flotation selectivity of
a sulphide copper ore. The concentrate (chalcopyrite and bornite)
was contaminated by magnesium present in hypersthene (an iron
and magnesium silicate). Liberation studies, zeta potential deter-
minations and microflotation experiments suggested that the
hypersthene flotation with thiocollectors was activated by the
presence of ferrous ions present in the mineral lattice and also re-
leased by grinding media and mill liners. After failure with the use
of high molecular weight starch depressants, dispersion/depres-
sion was successfully achieved with the use of a low molecular
weight dextrin. The MgO content in the industrial concentrate
was brought down from 7.5% to 3.3%, well below the metallurgical
specification 4.5%.

Bulatovic (1999) reviewed the use of organic polymers in the
polymetallic ores flotation. Aspects of the chemistry of starches,
dextrins, modified lignosulfonates, and quebracho were discussed.

Galena depression is achieved with dextrins (Bulatovic, 1999)
and other organic polymers such as guar gum, corn starch, poly-
sulphonated species (Pugh, 1989). Galena depression is a target
in lead–copper systems, but is totally undesirable regarding the
present investigation.

Lange et al. (1997) reported that the flotation of fine sphalerite
(&lt;20 lm), at pH 5, may be enhanced by aggregation with coarse
particles (up to 100 lm) in the conditioning with xanthate. Even
before the reagents addition, aggregation was observed. At pH
8.5 the surface hydroxides inhibit flotation.

Wightman et al. (2000) showed that the floatability of ultrafine
galena (&lt;5 lm) may be improved by selective aggregation onto
coarse galena, precipitated in the laboratory, previously condi-
tioned with a polymer.

Boulton et al. (2001a,b) investigated the iron sulphides depres-
sion in sphalerite flotation. Low molecular weight polyacrylamides,

modified by the presence of carboxyl, sulphonate, hydroxyl, and
thiourea, were efficient pyrite depressants. The depressant action
was stronger on coarse particles and the polyacrylamides must
be added prior to the collector addition.

Bandini et al. (2001) investigated the deleterious action of iron oxi-
des slimes coating on galena flotation. Slimes may be removed by a
shear conditioning and pH control combination, as well as the use of
anionic reagents (carboxymethylcellulose and polyphosphates).

50% Dispersol + 50% meta; 50% Na2SiO3 + 50% HMP; 50% Na2-
SiO3 + 50% meta.

Mineral samples as pure as possible were collected in the mine
by the geology team: galena (Zn 0.75%, Pb 81.98%, Fe 0.33%), sphal-
erite (Zn 59.99%, Pb 1.70%, Fe 2.04%), pyrite (Zn 0.15%, Pb 0.21%, Fe
26.49%), and dolomite, the major gangue mineral (Zn 0.34%, Pb
0.13%, Fe 2.80%).

A sample of the ore was collected in the concentrator, at the
feed point of the lead flotation circuit, to be used in the dispersion
experiments. The metallic elements content of this sample was Zn
4.36%, Pb 1.82%, Fe 4.10%.

The dispersion degree determinations procedure is described
next.

Each mineral sample (ground to ?150 lm) weighing 5 g was
added to the sedimentation tube in a pulp containing 13.5 mL
water at pH 10, adjusted with Na2CO3. The dispersant at a concen-
tration of 0.5% was then added at three dosage levels, 500 g/tonnes,
1500 g/tonnes, and 3000 g/tonnes, and conditioned for 3 min. After
the first conditioning stage, water at pH 10 was added to complete
the tube volume to 200 mL and an extra 3 min conditioning time
was provided. The system was brought to rest for five minutes
and the underflow and overflow fractions were collected, dried,
and weighed.

The dispersion degree was calculated as:

DD ¼ ½overflow mass=ðoverflow mass þ underflow massÞ?? 100

The sedimentation apparatus consists of a glass tube (4.5 cm diam-
eter; 16.3 cm height) provided with an opening for the supernatant
discharge (0.5 cm diameter) located at 1.5 cm from the bottom, sit-
ting on a magnetic stirrer to keep the pulp under suspension.

A laboratory flotation machine supplied with an automatic froth
removal system was used in the flotation tests. The sample for the
laboratory flotation tests was collected at the industrial grinding
circuit feed point, Fractions weighing 1400 g were wet ground in
the laboratory (467 mL of water) and added to the tank of the

flotation machine. Tap water was added to complete the volume
(3500 mL).

Reagents for galena flotation (Na2CO3 dosed to raise the pulp pH
to 9.8; dispersant, potassium isopropyl xanthate 70 g/t ROM and
frother) were conditioned at 1500 rpm. The rotor speed was then
reduced to 1100 rpm, the air flow rate was adjusted at 8 NL/min,
and flotation proceeded for 20 min.

The tailings from the galena flotation were conditioned with
copper sulphate (300 g/t ROM) for 5 min, at 1500 rpm, after pH
modulation to 10.5 with lime. Potassium isobutyl xanthate was
dosed at 150 g/t ROM and conditioned for 5 min. The rotor speed
was brought down to 1100 rpm and sphalerite was floated for
20 min.

In the flotation experiments results, dispersant dosage zero g/t
refers to the standard test in the absence of dispersant.

Table 1 illustrates the lead flotation experiments planning. One
of the targets was checking the sodium carbonate role in the
system.

Table 2 illustrates the zinc flotation experiments planning. The
pH was modified with lime.

4. Results

4.1. Sedimentation tests

Duplicated sedimentation experiments were performed with
five mineral fractions, using nine individual or blended dispersing
agents, at three addition levels, yielding a total of 450 tests. Disper-
sion degrees (DD) below 15% were considered as low, between 15%
and 30% medium, and figures above 30% were treated as a high dis-
persion degree.

For each mineral fraction sets of four dispersing agents (individ-
ual or combination) were selected as representative of reagents
yielding higher and lower dispersion degrees, respectively.

Considering the 1500 g/t dosage, the reagents are listed in a se-
quence of high to low dispersing effectiveness.

? Ore high DD: 3223 &gt; HMP = Dispersol &gt; Dispersol + HMP
? Ore low DD: Na2CO3 &gt; Na2SiO3 + meta &gt; Na2SiO3 &gt; NaOH

Dispersion degrees in the presence of the reagents selected
for the flotation experiments, at 1500 g/t dosage, are presented in
Table 3.

Based on information on the dispersion behaviour of the ore
and its components, provided by the sedimentation experiments,
four criteria were established for the selection of reagents to be
used in the laboratory flotation experiments:

(i) Lead flotation: reagent yielding high dispersion degree for
galena and low dispersion degree for the other minerals
and ore; sodium silicate was selected, even being just a med-
ium dispersant for pyrite.

(ii) Zinc flotation: reagent yielding high dispersion degree for
sphalerite and low dispersion degree for the other minerals
and ore; a blend of sodium silicate and sodium metasilicate
was selected for meeting all the required conditions.

(iii) Lead and zinc flotation: reagent yielding low dispersion
degree for pyrite and high dispersion degree for the other
minerals and ore; dispersant 3223 was selected for sharply
meeting the required conditions.

(iv) Lead and zinc flotation: reagent yielding high dispersion
degree for all the minerals and ore; sodium hexametaphos-
phate was selected for sharply meeting the required
conditions.

4.2. Flotation

Galena flotation results, designated as lead flotation, in the
presence of sodium polyacrylate (reagent 3223) are presented in
Fig. 1.

Unacceptable losses of zinc in the lead concentrate were ob-
served, with consequent drop in lead grade. Lead recovery was

not affected. The reagent seems to activate sphalerite flotation
even in copper sulphate absence.

Galena flotation results in the presence of sodium hexameta-
phosphate are presented in Fig. 2.

Comparing with the standard test (0 g/t), a drop in the lead con-
tent in the concentrate was observed as a consequence of zinc loss.
Again, undesirable activation of sphalerite was observed.

Galena flotation results in the presence of sodium silicate are
presented in Fig. 3.

The reagent not only decreases lead grade and recovery in the
concentrate, but also increases sharply zinc losses.

The activation of sphalerite by dispersants may be explained by
the fact that disperse fine galena particles are prone to surface oxi-
dation and, thus releasing Pb2+ ions in solution. Lead cations are
well-known sphalerite activators (Basilio et al., 1996).

It is worthwhile stressing that the lead feed grades in the three
sets of experiments were different due to fluctuations in the ROM,
resulting in different results for the standard test (absence of dis-
persant). The experiments with sodium hexametaphosphate were

performed with lead feed grade 2.1%, a figure similar to that of
the sequence in the presence of sodium silicate (2.2% Pb). Both se-
quences yielded similar results for the standard test. The standard
test in the presence of polyacrylate was carried out with a richer
sample (3.6% Pb), producing higher concentrate lead grade and
recovery.

A final comment on dispersants effect on lead flotation is that
none of them enhanced this stage performance. Nevertheless, the
dispersion studies provided a relevant technological information.
Sodium carbonate does not have any dispersing effect towards
either individual minerals or the ore. Bench scale experiments
were performed with the less expensive reagent hydrated lime
substituting for soda ash as pH modulator in the lead circuit. Lab-
oratory experiments indicated also that lead flotation is possible at
natural pH. A successful plant trial conducted to the incorporation
of lime to the concentrator plant practice.

a sharp increase in zinc recovery, without significant drop in zinc
grade and no lead contamination in the concentrate.

Sphalerite flotation results in sodium hexametaphosphate pres-
ence are presented in Fig. 5. The reagent was effective in increasing
zinc recovery and keeping the lead content in the concentrate low.
A decrease in the zinc grade in the concentrate was observed.

Sphalerite flotation results in the presence of a sodium silicate
and metasilicate blend are illustrated in Fig. 6. No significant effect
was observed regarding both zinc grade and grade.

Zinc feed grade in the sequence with the sodium silicate and
metasilicate blend was different from that of the tests in the pres-
ence of sodium polyacrylate and sodium hexametaphosphate.
5. Conclusions

The dispersants use in the lead flotation stage did not improve the
overall circuit efficiency. Despite enhancing the lead recovery, the re-
agents caused unacceptable zinc losses in the lead concentrate.
Lead flotation either at natural pH or pH 9.8 modified with so-
dium carbonate or lime presented similar results.

A technological consequence of the low sodium carbonate dis-
persing ability was the use of lime substituting for the more expen-
sive sodium carbonate as pH modifier in the industrial circuit.

The use of both, the sodium polyacrylate 3223 and the inorganic
dispersant sodium hexametaphosphate, increased significantly the
zinc recovery, keeping low the lead content in the zinc concentrate
and not interfering with the iron content in this product.
