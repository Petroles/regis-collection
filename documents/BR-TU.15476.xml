Nanopartículas mesoporosas de sílica são conhecidas por induzirem hemólise de células 
vermelhas do sangue (RBCs) humano quando ensaios de citotoxicidade são feitos em solução-
tampão de fosfato (PBS). Entretanto, em uma abordagem mais realista, a presença de biomoléculas 
do plasma sanguíneo precisa ser considerada em qualquer avaliação nanotoxicológica de 
nanopartículas porosas de SiO2 quando se objetiva a sua utilização em aplicações biomédicas através 
de administração intravenosa. Nesse contexto, demonstrou-se neste trabalho que nanopartículas 
porosas de sílica não induzem nenhum efeito citotóxico em células vermelhas do sangue quando 
ensaios de hemólise são feitos na presença de plasma sanguíneo, independentemente da carga 
superficial (positiva ou negativa) da nanopartícula. A ausência de hemólise está principalmente 
associada à adsorção de proteínas do plasma sobre a superfície das nanopartículas, levando à 
formação de um recobrimento proteico estável (denominado protein corona ou PC) que blinda o 
ambiente microquímico original das nanopartículas.

Mesoporous silica nanoparticles are known to induce the hemolysis of human red blood cells 
(RBCs) when citotoxicity assays are performed in a phosphate buffer solution (PBS). However, 
in a more realistic approach, the presence of blood plasma biomolecules must be considered in 
any nanotoxicological evaluation of porous SiO2 nanoparticles when biomedical applications 
through intravenous administration are aimed. In this context, it is demonstrated in this work that 
porous silica nanoparticles do not induce any cytotoxic effect on RBCs when hemolysis assay 
is done in the presence of blood plasma, regardless the surface charge (positive or negative) of 
the nanoparticle. The absence of hemolysis is mainly associated with the adsorption of plasma 
proteins on the nanoparticle surface, which leads to the formation of a stable protein coating (called 
protein corona or PC) that shields the original microchemical environment of bare nanoparticles.

Introduction

Since porous silica nanoparticles were elected as 
possible protagonists in a future revolution of several 
medical processes of theranosis, they have been widely 
studied during the last decade through the host-guest 
approach, thus resulting in promising perspectives mainly 
in the areas of detection1-3 and treatment of tumors.4-7 
While part of the scientific community creatively advances 

towards the engineering of porous silica nanostructures, 
others are acting in a proactive approach by considering 
environmental and toxicological effects of nano-based silica 
materials. In the latter context, several in vitro citotoxicity 
assays indicated a very high biocompatibility of porous 
silica nanoparticles.8-10 However, a desirable in vivo 
biocompatibility is not straightforward. For instance, it is 
well known that amorphous silica particles induce toxicity 
on human red blood cells (RBCs) and, consequently, 
this test is being used as a key indicator towards the safe 
production of SiO2 platforms for nanomedicine through 
intravenous administration. Although the mechanism of 
the silica-induced hemolysis phenomenon is not yet totally 



Suppression of the Hemolytic Effect of Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles after Protein Corona Interaction J. Braz. Chem. Soc.1808

understood, it is known that the hemolytic effect is mainly 
associated with the surface microchemical environment of 
silica, which consists primarily of silanol groups (Si–OH) 
that can ionize and interact with phosphatidylcholine 
groups of RBC membranes leading to their disruption.11,12 
Consequently, the density of silanol groups over the surface 
was proved to be directly related with the hemolysis, 
although this relationship is not strictly predictable.

Since the engineering of silica nanostructures advanced 
along the last decade, parameters other than the concentration 
of silanol groups at the nanoparticle surface were 
recognized as being responsible for the toxicity on RBCs. 
In this way, the evaluation of the dependence of the size 
and shape of porous SiO2 nanostructures on the hemolysis 
of RBCs has been systematically done during the last years. 
Firstly, it was observed that silanol groups on mesoporous 
silica structures induce less hemolytic effect compared to 
rigid spherical nanoparticles possibly due to shape-induced 
effects, which determine the spatial availability of silanols 
on the nanoparticle-cell interface.13 Further, it was observed 
that: (i) smaller Stöber silica nanoparticles (24 nm) 
induce a pronounced hemolytic effect when compared 
with bigger ones (263 nm);14 (ii) nanostructures with high 
aspect ratio (nanorods) are more cytotoxic than spherical 
nanoparticles;15 (iii) mesoporous silica nanostructures 
(MSNs) with ordered pores (MCM-41) induce a stronger 
hemolytic effect compared with non-ordered;14 (iv) small 
mesoporous nanoparticles (20 nm) consisted of ethenylene-
bridged silsesquioxane present very low toxicity16 and (v) 
polymers such as PEG (polyethylene glycol) can be used 
to coat particles in order to greatly reduce the hemolysis.17 
Furthermore, an extensive assessment of the interaction 
of bare and functionalized porous silica nanomaterials 
with RBCs concluded that SBA-15-type MSNs cause 
the deformation of RBCs and consequently lead to their 
disruption. Amine functionalizations on the surfaces of 
MSNs also reduce the hemolytic effect.18 However, despite 
all improvements achieved so far on the SiO2 surface 
chemistry aiming to overcome the citotoxicity issues, 
a key parameter must be now considered when dealing 
with interactions of nanostructures in biological media. 
Dawson’s group at UCD, Dublin, has demonstrated that 
the adsorption of plasma biomolecules on the nanoparticle 
surface leads to the formation of a stable biomolecule 
coating, which has been called protein corona (PC).19,20 
The composition of this coating changes over time because 
the adsorption is a dynamical process in which there is 
exchange between the constituents of the corona and 
biological medium. PC has been divided into two main 
components named “hard” and “soft” coronas, which 
are characterized by “long” and “short” exchange times, 

respectively. These coatings greatly influence on the way 
that the nanometer entity is “seen” by cell and organs.21,22 
In this case, the dependence of size, porous structure and 
surface chemistry of SiO2 nanoparticles on the hemolysis of 
RBCs may manifest differently when such nanostructures 
interact with proteins of the human blood plasma and, 
consequently, the final effect on RBCs is a result of the 
PC formation and not only of the bare silica surface itself. 
In this context, it is important to call the attention for the 
suppression of the hemolysis when the assay is performed 
in the blood plasma medium. 

In this paper, it is demonstrated that porous SiO2 
nanoparticles in the sub-hundred nanometer range with 
three different surface microchemical environments (and 
electrochemical features) do not induce toxicity on RBCs 
when evaluated in the presence of human blood plasma, 
thereby contrasting with the pronounced hemolytic effect 
observed when the assay is done in phosphate buffer 
solution (PBS).

Experimental

Synthesis of porous silica nanoparticles

In order to evaluate these surface effects above 
mentioned, silica nanoparticles with a size distribution from 
40-80 nm and pore size around 2 nm were produced through 
a sol-gel method previously reported.23 This methodology 
is basically a modification of the Stöber method,24 which 
uses TEOS (tetraethyl orthosilicate) as the Si precursor and 
ammonia solution (NH3) as the basic catalyst. The synthesis 
of porous silica nanoparticles was carried out under a 
high concentration of precursors, which grants highly 
uniform spherical-shaped nanoparticles. For this, 0.75 g of 
cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was dissolved 
in 20.0 mL of a NH3 aqueous solution (0.048 mol L

–1) and 
the final solution was homogenized under magnetic stirring 
in a round-bottomed distillation flask attached to a reflux 
condenser at 5 °C (to avoid ethanol evaporation). To this 
solution, 3.20 mL of absolute ethanol were added as the 
cosolvent and the mixture was homogenized for 15 min at 
60 °C. Sequentially, 2.50 mL of TEOS (1.20 mmol) were 
inserted and the flask was kept at the same temperature for 
2 h under stirring. By ending the reaction, products were 
isolated by centrifugation at 17,949 rcf (Beckman Coulter, 
Brea, USA) and washed with absolute ethanol before the 
extraction of the soft-template (CTAB). Finally, the sample 
was washed twice with absolute ethanol and dried at 60 °C 
for 24 h. This sample was named Si–OH, according to the 
surface microchemical environment, which consists of 
silanol groups. Details regarding the extraction process 



Paula et al. 1809Vol. 23, No. 10, 2012

of CTAB are described in the Supplementary Information 
(SI) section.

Surface functionalization of porous silica nanoparticles

The influence of the surface microchemical environment 
on the hemolysis of RBCs was evaluated through the 
strict decoration of the nanoparticle surface in order to 
generate antagonistic electrochemical environments 
(negatively and positively charged) as a function of the 
organosilanes used for functionalization. These different 
microchemical environments would provide useful insights 
regarding possible chemical interactions occurring with 
RBCs. For the first case, the negatively charged surface, 
a hierarchical functionalization of the nanoparticle with 
propylmethylphosphonate (an ionizable group) was achieved 
by a sequential addition of the organosilane as a function 
of the reaction time. This co-condensation method was 
introduced by Bein and co-workers.25 In this way, 127.7 µL of 
3-(trihydroxysilyl)-propylmethyl-phosphonate (THSPMP) 
were added after 90 min of synthesis, time in which most of 
silica monomers are already condensed as nanoparticles. The 
quantity of THSPMP used represents an excess of 2.5% mol 
of silicon based on the quantity used for the production of 
sample Si–OH. In this approach, just an external decoration 
was promoted during the last 30 min of reaction, while the 
internal porous structure is preserved as the same as for 
sample Si–OH. All synthetic conditions and experimental 
apparatus were the same used for the synthesis of sample 
Si–OH. This sample was named Si–P(CH3)O3H.

In order to obtain a positively charged surface 
on the silica porous nanoparticles, a decoration with 
3-aminopropyl moieties was carried out by a different 
process once the co-condensation of its respective 
organosilane (3-aminopropyltrietoxysilane or APTES) 
induces a variation in the pH that leads to the production 
of elongated nanoparticles (aggregated). In this way, 
the modification of the silica surface was done by a 
post-grafting process of sample Si–OH. The residual 
CTAB still present in the pores of the SiO2 nanoparticles 
hinders the attachment of APTES on the internal porous 
structure, thus restricting the decoration on the external 
surface. For this, 290 mg of sample Si–OH (before 
submitting to the extraction process of CTAB) were 
resuspended by sonication in 40 mL of ethanol for 30 min 
and transferred to a round-bottomed distillation flask 
attached to a reflux condenser at 5 °C. The suspension 
was homogenized under stirring for 15 min at 60 °C, and 
then 730 µL of APTES were added to the mixture (excess 
of 25% mol of silicon based on sample Si–OH). The 
reaction was kept under stirring at 60 °C for 60 min and 

at room temperature for 24 h. The percentage of silicon 
(% mol of Si) per gram of sample Si–OH was calculated 
through a thermogravimetric analysis by considering the 
residue above 850 °C as being just silicon dioxide (SiO2). 
After the synthesis, products (sample Si?NH2) were 
isolated by centrifugation at 17,949 rcf and washed with 
absolute ethanol before the extraction of the soft-template 
(CTAB). Finally, the sample was washed twice with 
absolute ethanol and dried at 60 °C for 24 h. More details 
regarding the experimental procedures as well as the 
characterization methods are provided in the SI section.

Incubation of SiO2 nanoparticles with human blood plasma

The preserved human blood plasma (250 mL) was 
obtained from the Hemocenter of Campinas at the 
University of Campinas (Unicamp , São Paulo State, Brazil). 
For the formation of the protein-coated nanoparticles, the 
plasma was firstly centrifuged at 17,949 rcf for 10 min and 
the supernatant was used in the experiments. Porous SiO2 
nanoparticles (5.0 mg mL–1 in deionized water) were then 
incubated with the centrifuged plasma at 55% for 1 h at 
room temperature in microcentrifuge tubes (Eppendorf, 
Hamburg, Germany). After that, the tubes were centrifuged 
for 17,949 rcf for 30 min, the supernatant was discarded 
and the obtained pellets (nanoparticles-PC complexes) 
were washed for 3 times with a phosphate buffer solution 
to remove the excess of unbound plasma proteins. In order 
to demonstrate the protein corona formation, dynamic 
light scattering (DLS) measurements (Malvern, Malvern, 
UK) were performed by using 50 µg mL–1 of bare and 
PC-nanoparticles in deionized water (DI water).

Hemolysis assay

The impact of the nanoparticle surface chemistry on 
human red blood cells (RBCs) and the influence of the 
protein corona interaction on this process were evaluated 
by the standard hemolysis assays.26 It was used RBCs from 
preserved human blood, obtained from the Hemocenter 
of Campinas at the University of Campinas (Unicamp). A 
volume of 8 mL of blood was added to 0.8 mL of a 3.8% 
sodium citrate solution in a 15 mL Falcon tube to prevent 
coagulation. The blood was mixed gently and centrifuged 
at 10,000 rcf for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded 
and RBCs were washed 5 times by suspending them in 
a phosphate buffer saline solution (pH 7.4). The final 
suspension used for the hemolysis assay consisted of 5% 
(v/v) of RCBs in a phosphate buffer solution. To evaluate the 
hemolytic effect, different concentrations of nanoparticles 
were incubated with RBCs (200 µL of a 5% suspension) 



Suppression of the Hemolytic Effect of Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles after Protein Corona Interaction J. Braz. Chem. Soc.1810

in the presence and absence of blood plasma at 2% (20 
µL of centrifuged plasma) in a phosphate buffer solution 
in sterile microcentrifuge tubes. The tubes were incubated 
for 2 h at room temperature through a static method after 
gently homogenization. The final volume of the hemolysis 
assay in all experiments was 1.0 mL. After the incubation, 
tubes were centrifuged for 5 min and 100 µL were carefully 
removed from each tube and transferred to a clean 96-well 
plate. The quantification of hemoglobin in the supernatant 
of a nanoparticle-RBC mixture and nanoparticle-protein 
corona-RBC mixture was done by recording the absorbance 
of hemoglobin at 540 nm (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The 
positive control consisted of 0.8 mL of deionized water and 
0.2 mL of a RBCs suspension at 5%. The negative control 
consisted of 0.8 mL of a phosphate buffer solution and 
0.2 mL of the RBCs suspension (5%). The percentage of 
hemolysis was calculated by using the linear equation y = mx 
+ c, where the percentage of hemolysis (x) = [optical density 
(y) – negative control optical density (c)] / [(positive control 
optical density – negative control optical density)/100]. 
To demonstrate the influence of the specific surface area 
of porous SiO2 nanoparticles on the hemolytic effect, the 
amount of nanoparticles used in the hemolysis assay was 
normalized according to the specific surface area estimated 
through the BET method.

Results and Discussion

The spherical morphology of the synthesized silica 
nanoparticles is highly uniform for the three samples produced, 
presenting diameters which vary from approximately 40 
-80 nm, as observed through bright-field transmission 
electron microscopy (BF-TEM, see Figure 1) and through 
the nanoparticle size distribution (insets, Figure 1) resulted 
from the measurement of the Feret diameter of at least 
100 particles observed in the images. An examination 
of the porosity by nitrogen adsorption-desorption 
experiments shows the presence of a complex porous 
structure, manifested in a type II isotherm with a H3-like 
hysteresis for all samples (IUPAC classification). However, 
a subtle stepwise behavior is observed around P/P0 = 0.4  
(see Figure S1a in the SI section), which is related to a 
capillarity phenomenon, typical of ordered mesopore 
structures. The specific surface area of the samples varied 
from 855 m2 g–1 for the bare silica (sample Si–OH) to the 
minimum value of 624 m2 g–1 for sample Si–NH2, thus 
indicating that the degree of surface functionalization 
with aminopropyl and propylmethylphosphonate radicals 
causes just a minor obstruction of the porous cavities. As 
further shown, this decrease in the specific surface area 
is proportional to the amount of condensed groups on 

the particle surface. Parallely, pore volumes presented a 
subtle increase with the surface functionalization of the 
nanoparticles, varying from 0.8 to 1.1 cm3 g–1 (see Table 1). 
The size distribution of the non-ordered pores calculated 
through the BJH method from the N2 adsorption branch 
spans from less than 2 to 5 nm (see Figure S1b in the SI 
section), thus comprising pores that cover the micro- and 
mesopore size classification. With the use of the high 
angle annular dark-field transmission electron microscopy 
(HAADF-TEM), the greater contrast differences based 
on the electron scattering phenomenon from sample 
thickness allowed an accurate pore size distribution 
measurement, indicating an average diameter of 1.8 nm 
(standard deviation = 0.5).23 Due to the low amount of 
surface functionalizing organic groups used as well as due 
to the overlapping of bands in Fourier transform infrared 
(FTIR) spectra, vibrational fingerprints are not suitable for 
either identification or quantification of the functionalizing 
radicals on the nanoparticles. In this way, the confirmation of 
the external functionalization on the SiO2 nanoparticles was 
done through 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) with 
the method of cross polarization and magic angle spinning 
of neighboring 1H nuclei (CPMAS). As observed in the 
chemical structure diagram and NMR spectra (see Figures 
S2 and S3a in the SI section), the presence of carbon atoms 
relative to propylamine and propylmethylphosphonate 
groups is evidenced in the range from 0 to 80 ppm of 
13C NMR spectra. As expected, ethoxy (Si?O–CH2CH3) 
groups originated from the extraction process of CTAB 
with the ethanolic solution of hydrochloric acid are 
evidenced, as well as carbon atoms related to residues of 
CTAB inside the pores. The degree of condensation of the 
organosilanes was obtained through 29Si NMR with the 
method of high-power decoupling (HPDEC, 29Si ? 1H), 
which provides a quantitative relation between the different 
silicon sites present in the samples. After deconvolution of 
peaks with Gaussian functions (see Figures S3b, S3c and 
S3d in the SI section), the calculus indicated that there 
are approximately 7.1 and 2.0%-mol of silicon bonded 
to propylamine and propylmethylphosphonate groups, 
respectively. Surface electrochemical features achieved 
with the functionalization on each nanoparticle are observed 
through zeta potential measurements (see Table 1). The 
results indicated the presence of a more positively-charged 
surface for sample Si–NH2 and a more negative surface 
for sample Si–P(CH3)O3H. By considering the deviation 
of about 200 m2 g–1 in the specific surface area value, this 
parameter was normalized for the hemolysis experiments. 
In this way, differences in the RBC citotoxicity could be 
associated to the peculiar surface characteristics of the 
nanoparticles.



Paula et al. 1811Vol. 23, No. 10, 2012

The surface electrochemical characteristics between 
samples Si?OH, Si?NH2 and Si?P(CH3)O3H reflected 
in a very little differentiation on the adsorption features 
of proteins when the nanoparticles were dispersed in 
human blood plasma (55% of blood plasma). After 
several washing and centrifugation runs to ensure the 
elimination of weakly adsorbed biomolecules (i.e., “soft” 
corona), the presence of strongly adsorbed proteins (i.e., 
“hard” corona)21 on the porous silica nanoparticle surface 
is directly evidenced through dynamic light scattering 
analyses (DLS), which indicated larger particle diameters 
for the protein-coated nanoparticles (see Figure 2). The 
increase in the diameter after the interaction with the blood 
plasma varied from about 15 to 30 nm. The greater degree 
of functionalization in sample Si–NH2 (ca. 7% mol of Si, as 
seen through 29Si HPDEC NMR) compared to Si?P(CH3)
O3H (ca. 2% mol of Si) did not induce a variation in the 
hydrodynamic radius. The monodispersity of the three 
samples is confirmed through the polydispersity index 
(PdI) obtained for the suspensions in deionized water 
(DI), whose values were observed to be below 0.13 for 
all samples. After the dispersion in the biological medium 
(55% of blood plasma), although the presence of the 
“hard” corona led to an increase of the nanoparticles 
sizes, the polydispersity index did not change (below 
0.13). Zeta potential values for protein-coated silica 
nanoparticles at a pH of 7.4 (PBS) were all negative and no 

significant variations were observed for the three samples 
(average = –14.3 ± 9.2 mV).

The schematic diagram presented in Figure 3 summarizes 
the surface groups sitting on the nanoparticles which 
were used to probe the different interaction possibilities 
with the constituents from the human blood plasma. 
This might result in different toxicological effects of the 
porous silica nanoparticle on RBCs. Initially, by neglecting 
particular interactions with RBCs that might emerge from 
stereochemical considerations as well as from hydrogen 
bonds and van der Waals forces (peculiar for each chemical 
moiety use), it would be considered here just the interactions 
arisen from an electrostatic point of view (Coulomb forces), 
through ionization and protonation events that lead to 
antagonistically charged chemical radicals. Furthermore, 
the key event being considered responsible for the hemolysis 
is the interaction with RBC membranes, while secondary 
metabolic effects induced by the presence of porous silica 
nanoparticles are being neglected by the approaches reported 
so far in the literature.14-16,18

As it has been recently reported,21,22,27 the dynamic 
interaction phenomenon occurring in biological media in 
which biomolecules may adsorb on a nanoparticle surface 
(and also desorb from it) results in a corona coating 
(illustrated in Figure 3b) that will play a key role in all 
further biological effects manifested in a living organism. 
In a more specific case, the influence of these coatings on

the hemolysis of RBCs was analyzed here for positively 
and negatively charged porous silica nanoparticles. 
The hemolysis was evaluated for five concentration of 
each functionalized nanoparticle (Si–OH, Si–NH2 and 
Si–P(CH3)O3H): 32.2, 62.5, 125, 250 and 500 µg mL

–1. 
Positive and negative controls were taken with DI 
water and PBS. In the first case, when the assays were 
performed with porous silica nanoparticles dispersions 
in PBS, up to the maximum concentration used in this 
study (500 µg mL–1), the toxicity was dose-dependent for 
all samples (see top panel in Figure 4a). Silanol groups 
on the surface (sample Si–OH) induced the highest 
toxicity among samples, thus leading to the breaking of 
more than 50% of RBCs present in the solution. Sample 
Si?NH2 presented the lowest cytotoxic response (10% of 
hemolysis). When the hemolytic assay was carried out in a 
phosphate buffer solution containing human blood plasma, 
even in low concentrations of plasma such as 2%, it was 
observed the absence of hemolysis for all samples and all 
concentrations tested (see bottom panel in Figure 4a). The 
absence of hemolysis was also observed for hard corona 
silica nanoparticles obtained after their incubation with 
55% of plasma (data not shown). 

By assuming the occurrence of a surface-induced 

biological effect that leads to the breaking of RBCs, the 
hemolysis is primarily related to the amount of atoms 
exposed to cells at the solid-liquid interface, which are 
responsible for the chemical interactions. Thus, as there 
is a difference in the specific surface area among samples 
Si–OH, Si–NH2 and Si–P(CH3)O3H, another hemolysis 
assay in a phosphate buffer solution (without blood 
plasma) was carried out by normalizing the quantity 
of nanoparticles used in the experiments by the highest 
specific surface area (855 m2 g–1 for sample Si–OH). 
Through this experiment, it was observed that the specific 
surface area-normalized nanoparticles with negatively 
charged surface (samples Si–OH and Si–P(CH3)O3H) 
present practically the same citotoxicity. However, even

when its quantity is normalized to achieve 855 m2 g–1, 
aminated nanoparticles (sample Si–NH2) still induce a 
very low cytotoxic effect on RBCs.

In general, the hemolysis of human RBCs induced 
by silica nanoparticles (without blood plasma) may 
be associated to reactive oxygen species (ROS) on the 
surface of the particle,11 and electrostatic interactions 
of deprotonated silanols with proteins membranes28 
and tetra-alkyl ammonium groups also present in the 
membranes.13,29 As the hemolytic effect of negatively 
charged silica was practically the same when samples 

were normalized by specific surface area, it is possible 
to conclude that not only the negative zeta potential must 
be considered as the responsible for the citotoxicity of 
the nanoparticles, once sample Si–P(CH3)O3H possesses 
a more negatively charged surface. In this way, other 
mechanisms and interactions such as ROS, hydrogen 
bonds and van der Waals forces must be considered 
as responsible for the citotoxicity observed here. On 
the other hand, the low hemolytic effect induced by 
sample Si–NH2 may be mainly associated to the positive 
value of zeta potential, which cancels the electrostatic 
interactions with the positively charged tetra-alkyl 
ammonium groups present in the membranes. However, 
regardless positive or negative surface charges, the 
adsorption of plasma biomolecules (mainly proteins) 
on the nanoparticle surfaces occurred for all samples 
analyzed. Thus, the suppression of the hemolysis after 
the protein corona interaction on all samples demonstrates 
that the biomolecule coating acts as a very efficient 
surface shielding, thus isolating the surface microchemical 
environment of the nanoparticle regardless the surface 
charge (positive or negative), as well as other peculiar 
chemical characteristics of the surface moieties used 
(silanol, amine and methylphosphonate).

Conclusions

This work contributes to add information to the 
database of physical chemical and toxicological properties 
of porous silica nanoparticles reported in the literature by 
using the hemolysis of human red blood cells as a simple 
short-term in vitro assay towards a safe nanotechnology. It 
was shown here that human blood plasma suppresses the 
hemolytic effect of porous silica nanoparticles regardless 
their surface microchemical environment. Although the 
phenomenon is clearly observed, there is not yet enough 
knowledge about the mechanisms that dictates the 
interactions at the nanoparticle/protein corona/red blood 
cell interfaces present in the biological milieu. Therefore, 
understanding the mechanisms of the protein corona 
interaction and their impact on the cell surface has become 
an important aspect along with the design of silica-based 
nanostructures for nanobiotechnology and nanomedicine, 
and this paper addresses some issues on this direction. 
Furthermore, the protein corona may be considered not 
only as an important biological phenomenon that must be 
recognized hereafter on nanotoxicology, but also a useful 
coating process that may be used as a tool to minimize 
nanoparticles toxicity of several materials making them 
biocompatible for uncountable envisaged applications in 
nanomedicine.

Figure 4. (a) Evaluation of the percentage of hemolysis of RBCs induced 
by porous silica nanoparticles with three different surface microchemical 
environment: containing silanols (sample Si?OH, negatively charged), 
propylamine (sample Si?NH2, positively charged) and propylmethyl-
phosphonate (sample Si?P(CH3)O3H, negatively charged). The standard 
deviation is a result of at least three independent tests. Numbers on the 
right photograph stand for the concentration of particles, and positive 
and negative controls were done with DI water (C+) and PBS (C–), 
respectively. A photograph of the results is inserted; red color in vials 
supernatants indicates damaged RBCs (release of hemoglobin). (b) 
Hemolytic effect of porous silica nanoparticles in PBS (without blood 
plasma) when samples are normalized in mass or specific surface area.
