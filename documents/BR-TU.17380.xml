No trabalho aqui apresentado foram estudados dois tipos de materiais 

compósitos. O primeiro grupo de materiais consiste em materiais porosos 

obtidos a partir de sinterização de uma mistura de microesferas metálicas com 

microesferas de vidro. As propriedades dos materiais porosos preparados com 

apenas microsferas de vidro já foram estudadas; o estudo aqui descrito tem 

como objectivo investigar a influencia de misturar microesferas metálicas nas 

propriedades mecânicas do produto final. Os resultados indicam que as 

microesferas metálicas diminuem a resistência do material e essa diminuição é 

dependente da concentração de esferas metálicas; após certa concentração a 

diminuição é acentuada. Propõe-se uma explicação provisória. Também foi 

estudada a morfologia de fractura utilizando a técnica de microscopia óptica. O 

segundo grupo de materiais foi preparado a partir de esferas ocas metálicas e 

uma resina. O objectivo final é preparar um material leve mas resistente a 

impactos. Foram preparados materiais compósitos utilizando a técnica 

convencional que resultou  em amostras com lacunas. A nova técnica aqui 

apresentada diminui consideravelmente este problema e os compósitos 

preparados com esta técnica tem quase dobro de resistência mecânica.

Mechanical strength, metal-glass composite, microsphere , synthetic foam , 
fracture strength , modulus of rupture 
 

 

 

In this experimental study two different types of composite materials were 

prepared and their mechanical behavior was investigated. The first group 

consists of porous material made from sintering a mixture of micron size glass 

and metal spheres. Though the porous compacts made from glass 

microspheres have been already investigated, the main aim of the present work 

is to study the effect of varying the proportion of the metal spheres on the 

mechanical strength of the final sintered porous material. The results presented 

herein show that mixing metal microspheres always results in diminishing of the 

fracture strength of the final material and the decrease is first proportional to the 

volume ratio but after a certain percentage the material becomes very week; a 

provisional explanation is suggested. The fracture path and surface in disc type 

specimen broken under a flexural stress were also studied by optical 

microscopy. The second composite material studied consists of hollow metal 

spheres embedded in a polymer matrix; the general aim is to prepare light-

weight armour for energy absorption under impact. Composites were made by 

mixing the millimeter size hollow aluminum spheres in a two-part epoxy and 

subsequent thermal curing of the mixture. The tests on the cured samples 

showed that they generally had many voids and the strength was low. An 

improved procedure was devised that led to considerable reduction of voids 

and consequently an improvement in the strength.

Chapter 1: Composite Materials 

Composites are one of the most widely used materials because of their adaptability to different 

situations and the relative ease of preparation to serve specific purposes and have desirable 

properties. A Composite material is the combination of two or more materials, which takes the 

advantage of the good characteristics of each of the materials. Two phase composite materials 

mainly consist of two separate components, the matrix and the filler. The matrix holds the filler 

together to form the bulk of the material.  

 

Figure 1: The relative importance of metals, polymers, composites and ceramics as a function of 

time. (Gibson R.F; 1994; 2)
[1]  

The relative importance of metals, ceramics, polymers and composites in human life throughout 

the history of mankind is indicated in the figure above.

1.1 Classification of two phase composite materials 

Two distinct levels of classification of composite materials are possible. The first level of 

classification is usually with respect to the matrix constituent. The major composite classes 

include 

? Organic Matrix Composite 

o Polymer Matrix Composites  

o Carbon Matrix Composites 

? Metal Matrix Composites 

? Ceramic Matrix Composites 

? Hybrid Composites 

 

Figure 2: Classification of composite materials with metal matrix
 [2]

. 

The second level of classification refers to the reinforcement form, i.e. the geometric form of the 

filler phase. Under this classification we have – fiber reinforced composites, laminar composites, 

infiltration composites, particulate composites etc. 

 



3 

 

Figure 3: Classification of Reinforcement 

 Particulate Composites consist of a matrix reinforced with a dispersed phase in form of particles. 

The effect of the dispersed particles on the properties of the composite depends on the particle 

dimension. As an example, in one specific particulate composite, very small spherical particles 

with 0.25 micron in diameter are distributed in the matrix
 [3]

.

present in it; some of the advantages are listed below

1.2 Applications 

 The composite materials are used for various applications that demand high strength, 

high stiffness, or low thermal conductivity. Many aerospace parts made from by metal were 

substituted with the composites. The special properties of these materials, for example, low 

density light make them suitable for from aircraft and spacecraft structures
 [5]

 to automotive and 

trucks parts, from spacecraft components to printed circuit boards, sports equipment and health 

care equipment. Various components made from composites used on Airbus series of aircraft are 

given in the table below.

 The porous composites, in which one of the constituent phases is void, possess interesting 

properties like light weight, strength, resistance to thermal effects, chemical and thermal 

stability, low heat conductivity factor and many more
 [6]

. The development in the thermal and 

mechanical properties of porous ceramic materials led to the design of air bearings for the 

optimization of high precision and high speed machines. Motor spindles for precision tool 

machines required a constant air gap for steady properties even at highest rotation speeds. 

Energy dissipation in drives and the air friction in bearings at high relative velocities lead to 

thermal displacement. Ceramic bearings reduce the thermal deformation to a minimum
 [7]

.

1.3 Two phase composite materials 

 Any portion of a system that is physically homogeneous and bounded by a surface is 

called as a phase. A two phase material is one in which there are distinct constituents of the 

material that have different chemical or physical structure. For example, bulk metallic glass is a 

two-phase  material with good mechanical, chemical and functional properties (such as soft 

magnetism); the main problems, that limit their applications, are their brittle nature and poor 



6 

 

plasticity at room temperature and the lack of proper joining or integration technology
[10]

. In 

general, two-phase composite porous materials are believed to have both light weight and good 

mechanical strength along with other interesting properties. In the experimental study described 

herein, glass and metal microspheres are employed to prepare porous composites and study their 

mechanical and structural properties as a function of composition.  

1.3.1 Microspheres 

 Microspheres are spherical micro particles; typically have a diameter ranging from 1 to 

1000µm. Microspheres are well known for their ability to deliver active materials in the 

pharmaceutical and cosmetics industry
 [11]

. The Microspheres can be manufactured from both 

natural and synthetic materials. The spherical shape of the microspheres makes them different 

from other fillers in several aspects
 [12]

. The Microspheres are used in many advanced materials 

and composites, in the healthcare and personal care industries, and in many specialty research 

and development applications. Microspheres come in two basic types, solid and hollow. The 

solid microspheres commonly used as filler are generally of glass or ceramic. The solid glass 

microspheres are typically of soda lime glass due to its low cost, low melting temperature and 

proven chemical inertness.  

 

Figure 6: Solid soda lime glass microsphere, mean diameter 70µm
 [13] 



7 

 

 Hollow microspheres, also designated as balloons can be prepared of glass, ceramic, 

carbon or polymers like polystyrene. Most commonly used hollow fillers are glass microspheres, 

usually has a size range from 10 to 200µm and their walls are usually 0.4 to 1.5µm thick. Hollow 

microspheres show lower strength and density compare to solid microspheres
 [12]

. Solid glass 

Microspheres are light weight, hard and smooth. They offer excellent chemical resistance, low 

oil absorption and are used in automobile and electrical industry and also appear in household 

appliances, adhesives, packaging, paints and other materials used in construction industry. 3M 

Company has produced a high isostatic compressive strength (200 MPa) glass microsphere with 

density of 0.6 g/cm
3
 through innovative process and composition developments

 [14]
. 

 

1.3.2 Factors influencing the mechanical properties 

 Solid bodies obtained through sintering glass microspheres have useful characteristics of 

large porosity along with adequate mechanical strength. A large set of properties of the solid 

bodies through sintering glass microspheres can be described by the contact area between the 

adjacent spheres
 [15]

.  

 

Figure 7: Soda-lime glass beads of: (a) 1.5 mm sintered during 3 min (b) 3 mm sintered during 

3.5 min
 [16]

 



8 

 

 In a study
 [16]

 about the sintering behavior of soda lime glass beads, it was proved that the 

size of the beads has a direct influence in the sintering mechanism. The densification is faster 

with the decrease of the diameter of the beads. Figure 7(a) shows a better contact than in figure 

7(b) where the contact is just tangential, showing increase in densification with decrease in 

diameter. A graph in which relative density is drawn as a function of sintering time and size of 

the beads is shown in the figure (8) below.  

 

Figure 8: Evolution of density of soda-lime glass as a function of time and size of beads
 [16] 

From the figure (8) it is clear that the densification is faster for the smaller diameter soda lime 

glass beads. The densification provides the mechanical strength to the porous composite. The 

mechanism of densification is the viscous flow and the transition from low densification rate to 

high densification rate occurs over a narrow range of temperature
 [17]

. 



9 

 

 

Figure 9: Contact area between spheres increases with sintering time and reduced sphere size 

 The size of the pores decreases (densification) with increase in the sintering time and 

with decrease in the diameter of the spheres used. As the size is small the surface energy is more 

which is the driving force for sintering and leads to densification by reduction in the pore size; 

atomic diffusion into the pore results in reduced size of the pores. The stress concentration in the 

porous composite depends on the internal structure of the pores present in the material. The 

porosity is one of an important parameter in porous material while discussing its mechanical 

properties
 [15]

. The other parameters influencing the mechanical property during sintering porous 

material are co-ordination number, neck radius and neck size
 [15]

.  

 

1.4 Epoxy based Composites 

 Epoxy, chemically known as polyepoxide, is a thermosetting polymer obtained from 

reaction of an epoxide “resin” with polyamine “hardener”. Epoxy resins are widely used in 

filament-wound composites and are suitable for moulding purposes. They have a reasonable 

stability to chemical attacks and are excellent adherents with slow shrinkage during curing and 

no emission of volatile gases. However, the one used here, was to be not useful above a 

temperature of 140°C. The three phase synthetic foams, also known as “multifoams” or 

“diafoams” are used in applications requiring low densities. The multifoams systems exhibit 

good electrical properties and have low dielectric constant.  Macro sphere synthetic foam was 

prepared and investigated in this study.  



10 

 

 

Figure 10: Cross section of a three-phase synthetic foam system consisting of polymer matrix, 

hollow microspheres and voids 

 

 Hollow metal Macro sphere and Biresin LS epoxy resin are used to develop a macro 

sphere synthetic resin for this study.  The plastic, glass or ceramic macro spheres commercially 

available have diameters varying from 0.3 to hundreds of millimeters. Microspheres, whether 

solid or hollow, show properties that are directly related to their spherical shape, in which the 

ratio of surface area to volume is minimum. In resin rich surfaces of reinforced systems, the 

microspheres free of orientation and sharp edges are capable of producing smooth surfaces
 [18]

. 

One of the major advantages of synthetic foams is their ability to be designed and fabricated 

according to the physical and mechanical property requirements of the application. 

  

1.4.1 Factors influencing the Mechanical properties 

 The mechanical strength of these multi-foams decreases with increasing gaseous void 

fraction; the gaseous voids do not contribute to the strength properties of the composites. The 

voids in composite arise primarily because of air bubbles and volatile substances liberated during 

curing. 



11 

 

 

Figure 11: Schematic representation of (a) two phase and (b) three phase structures of synthetic 

foam 

The voids have another negative influence on the mechanical properties of the synthetic foam. 

The propagation of the crack during the mechanical testing is fast in the void region, leading to 

the failure of the system with much less load.  

 

1.4.2 Applications 

 The products cast from these macro spheres can be very large (up to several cubic 

meters) and are primarily used in marine flotation application such as offshore oil platform 

buoyancy modules, pipeline pontoons and buoy hulls
 [12]

. Light weight synthetic foams have 

been developed for a broad range of military and marine composite application. An ultra-light 

three-phase structure composed of macrospheres in a rigid resin binder has been designed for 

blast containment. This foam is carefully designed to optimize energy absorption and offers a 

well-defined crush stress and has a long constant stress plateau, key advantages for the design of 

lightweight crushable structure
 [19]

. The primary function of this foam is for energy absorption, 

e.g., in protective barriers, infrastructure panels, pressure vessel testing and flyer plate backing 

material. This synthetic foam is also an excellent lightweight, high specific property core 

material
 [19]

.

1.5 Mechanical Behavior of composites 

 The Mechanical properties reflect the response of a material subjected to an external 

force. The strength of the material refers to the ability to resist loads without failure. In ductile 

materials the plasticity and fracture are controlled by plastic flow, which works by motion of 

defects called dislocations. The plasticity and fracture of materials are more sensitive to the 

material microstructure. The dislocations can be impeded by changing the microstructure (by 

alloying and heat treatment), makes material harder and reduce its toughness. In brittle materials, 

strength and toughness depends on the flaws present in the material 
[20]

.  The brittle materials are 

unable to withstand high tensile stresses. Fracture in brittle materials frequently originates at a 

surface, and the strength is influenced by surface condition in conjunction with the internal 

microstructure rather than by internal microstructure alone
 [21]

.  Standard test methods for 

determining the flexural strength of brittle materials are either uniaxial (e.g. three – or four-point 

bending of beams) or biaxial flexural tests (e.g. piston-on-ring, piston-on-three-ball and ring-on-

ring tests)
 [22]

. Biaxial flexural strength tests have been widely accepted for evaluating the 

mechanical properties of thin brittle ceramic substrates.

materials

1.5.1 Piston- on -three –ball 

 An ASTM standard test method for biaxial flexural Strength of ceramic substrates was 

developed to determine the strengths of circular disks of brittle materials in 1978
[21]

 .The 

International Organization for Standardization has selected Piston-on-three-ball tests to establish 

ISO 6782 for dentistry-ceramic materials
 [22]

. In spite of the fact that the stress under the piston is 

non uniform, the advantage with this method is that the three balls support the specimen, 

allowing the use of a slightly warped specimen, and no surface grinding or polishing is required
 

[23]
. An analytical solution of piston-on-three-ball test has been derived by Kirstein and Wolley. 

Some of the parameters of piston-on-three-ball configuration are given in the figure 14 below.

Where S is the maximum tensile stress in MPa, P is the failure load in Newtons (N), O?  Poisson 

ratio of the material (microsphere), z radius of the circular support, rAC  radius of the loading 

area, RS  radius of the sintered compact and t thickness of the sintered compact. The Maximum 

tensile stress provides the highest stress used to resist the biaxial bending. A typical loading trace 

of the piston-on-3-ball experiment is given below in figure 15

1.5.2 Three point bending 

 The 3-point-bend test is a simple test and is widely used to measure the strength of brittle 

materials. In three point bending test one measures the force required to bend a beam under 3 

point loading conditions. The simplicity of the test method makes it a very popular tool. The area 

stressed in three point bending test is smaller, and so there is less chance of stressing a large 

flaw, resulting in higher strength value of the sample
 [25]

.

 The maximum tensile stress developed in the beam before failure is determined using 

three-point-bending formula. The formula used to calculate the modulus of rupture for a 

rectangular sample is given below. 

  

Modulus of rupture (M) =    

 

Where P is the breaking load, L is the length of the span, b is the average specimen width and d 

is the thickness of the specimen. During the loading process three types of failure are possible. 

First, a tensile failure may occur at the bottom of the beam, where the bending stress has the 

maximum positive value. Second, a compression failure may occur at the top of the beam where 

the bending stress has the maximum negative value.

Finally, a shear failure may occur at the neutral axis of the beam where the shear stress is largest
 

[27]
. These failure modes are depicted in the above figure 17. 

 In this study the mechanical behavior of two different composite materials is 

investigated. In the First composite material, glass microspheres are mixed with two different 

metal alloy microspheres. Piston-on-three-spheres test was performed to study the variation of 

the mechanical strength for different volume fractions of metal microspheres in glass-metal 

porous composite. The glass-metal microsphere powder was pressed to a disc and sintered and 

the sintered discs were tested for their strength. The principal aim of the study is to investigate 

how the strength of the composite varies with the volume fraction of metal spheres. For the 

second composite material, hollow metal macro spheres and Biresin LS epoxy resin are cured to 

develop light weight synthetic foam. Here, an improved preparation technique is sought for that 

could reduce the amount of voids in order to have better mechanical strength.  Three point 

bending test was performed to determine the mechanical strength of the synthetic foam.

 Solid glass microspheres are made by softening an irregular-shaped particle just enough 

to get it to flow into a spherical shape that it takes as a result of surface tension. This occurs 

around 750°C for A-glass 
[2]

. Solid glass microspheres from glass are most suitable for mixing 

with plastics. These special microspheres are coated with a binding agent, which bonds itself as 

well as the sphere’s surface to the resin, which increases the bonding strength and basically 

removes absorption of liquids into the separation between the spheres
 [7]

.  The microspheres used 

in this study, however, are not treated for plastics.  

Two different metal alloy microspheres were used with glass microspheres to prepare the 

composite porous disc. One metal alloy constitutes mainly of Cobalt (Co) and the other of Nickel 

(Ni); the compositions of the two are given in the Table 4 below.

The Microspheres are isotropic; their strength properties are constant over all directions.   

2.2 Preparation of glass microsphere discs 

The glass microsphere disc samples were prepared to determine their mechanical properties and 

various factors influencing their mechanical strength.  In this experimental study, the first set of 

samples prepared are the porous solid discs from glass microspheres alone. A sequence of steps 

were followed for the preparation: a homogeneous paste was prepared using glass microspheres 



20 

 

and polyethylene glycol, then the paste was pressed to obtain a disc shaped sample which was 

dried to provide the shape and initial strength, followed by a controlled sintering process to 

obtain the final shape and the mechanical strength.  

2.2.1 Preparation of paste 

 The glass microspheres with a size range of 150 -160 µm were separated using a sieving 

machine. Polyethylene glycol was used as a binder, which was added in order to provide shape 

and initial strength to the glass-microsphere-discs. The polyethylene glycol was completely 

dissolved in absolute ethanol and kept inside the oven at 60° for 30 min. A colorless solution was 

obtained after 30 min, which was then mixed with glass microspheres to obtain a paste. The 

mixed paste was placed inside the oven at 60° for 18 hours to get a homogeneous mixture.  

 

Figure 18: Preparation of homogeneous mixture of glass microsphere and polyethylene glycol 



21 

 

The ethanol was evaporated from the paste mixture during this period inside the oven and a 

homogenous coating of polyethylene glycol on the surface of the glass microsphere was 

obtained.  

2.2.2 Pressing of paste 

The homogeneous paste prepared above was pressed in a mechanical pressing machine to 

prepare disc shaped sample. Two grams of sample paste was placed in the pressing machine and 

2 tons of force for 1 min was applied to form initial disc. The paste was placed in between two 

metal discs which were placed between a bottom support and a top piston. The total setup was 

placed inside the pressing stand where the piston was placed beneath a load screw, which was 

tightened later. The valve on the right side of the apparatus was closed before applying the load. 

The load was increased to 2 tons with the help of a hand lever by the side of the apparatus. The 

load was applied for 1 min and then the valve at the right side was opened to release the load. 

Finally the disc sample was removed carefully.  

 

Figure 19: Mechanical pressing machine  



22 

 

The metal discs of the pressing machine were cleaned with ethanol to prevent sticking of the 

glass microsphere disc samples with the metal discs.  

2.2.3 Sintering process 

The sintering process is an important step in the preparation process which provides mechanical 

strength. The glass microsphere discs were placed inside the furnace on an alumina substrate. 

Initially the temperature was set to 300° C for 30 min, during this period the polyethylene glycol 

decomposes and then the temperature was increased to 640°C and kept for 24 hours. Afterwards 

normal cooling was done by switching off the furnace.  

 

 

 

Figure 20: Sintering Furnace 

2.3 Preparation of Glass-Metal Composite disc sample  

 In this preparation process different volume fraction of metal alloy microspheres (Cobalt alloy 

and Nickel alloy) were mixed with glass microspheres. Polyethylene glycol (15%) added with 



23 

 

ethanol was used as a binder. In the first set of metal-glass composites different percentages by 

weight of glass and metal microspheres were used to prepare the sample. The metal alloys with 

weight percentage of 10, 30 and 50 were used to prepare the first set of samples. In the second 

set of preparation 2, 5, 7 and 10 percentage by volume of metal was mixed with glass 

microspheres to prepare the composite.  

2.3.1 Preparation of paste 

 

Figure 21: Preparation of homogeneous mixture of glass-metal microsphere and polyethylene 

glycol 

The colorless paste of polyethylene glycol and absolute ethanol mixture obtained after 30 min in 

oven for 60°C was mixed with glass and metal microspheres. The mixture was then kept in a 



24 

 

linear vibrator with a frequency of 50HZ for 2 hours to obtain a homogenous mixture. The paste 

obtained has a homogeneous coating of polyethylene glycol over glass and metal microspheres. 

 

2.3.2 Pressing and sintering 

The procedure of pressing and sintering was the same as that of glass microsphere.  

 

Figure 22: Sintered samples of different percentage concentration of metal-glass microspheres  

The disc samples obtained were analyzed optically in a zoom microscope and then subjected to 

mechanical testing. 

 

2.4 Microscopic Analysis  

The microscopy image provides the information on the structure which in turn influences the 

mechanical properties.  The Microstructural analysis of these samples was done using Olympus 

ILLC2 Microscope. The sample was placed in the sample holder and the magnification was 

started with the minimum range and then it was increased up to 64X.  



25 

 

 

 

Figure 23: Olympus ILLC2 Microscope 

 

The microscopic images of these samples were obtained in the computer using U-Eye Demo 

software. The power was switched on and then USB cable from the computer was connected to 

the microscope. After setting up the microscope the U-Eye Demo icon in the computer was 

selected, in which optimal color =&gt; open camera option was selected to view the image in the 

computer screen. The images are captured by clicking snapshot option and finally saved in the 

folder. The microscopic images clearly show the state of bonding between microspheres.

2.5 Mechanical strength testing Procedure 

The mechanical strength of the sintered disc samples was determined using piston-on-three- 

sphere testing procedure. The apparatus for this experiment consist of a piston connected to the 

load unit of the Autograph machine and a sample holder with its support. The schematic 

representation of the apparatus is given below. 



28 

 

 

Figure 27: Piston-on-three-sphere Apparatus 

The disc sample was placed on the top of the three spheres in the sample holder. The load was 

applied on the center of the sample using the piston. The loading area of the piston is semi-

spherical in shape. The machine used for the mechanical testing was Shimadzu, with a load cell 

of 5KN.  

 

Figure 28: (a) Shimadzu Mechanical testing machine setup (b) Piston-on-3-sphere apparatus 

 



29 

 

The machine parameters were set using the controller; the loading speed of the piston was given 

as 0.5 mm/s. After placing the sample disc in the sample holder, Autograph software was used to 

start the testing. The applied load was not uniform due the roughness of the surface. The machine 

automatically stops the testing when the disc sample is broken. The data obtained from 

mechanical testing was retrieved form the computer. Eight set of samples were tested for each 

composition of metal-glass composites.  

2.5.1 Results  

Load versus deflection curve was drawn from the data obtained by mechanical testing. The 

mechanical strength of porous body obtained from glass microsphere was higher than that of 

metal-glass microsphere composite. The load deflection graphs for different volume fractions of 

metal in metal-glass composites are given below.

The Load vs. deflection figures clearly show that notwithstanding scatter in the data for the same 

composition, the mechanical strength goes down with increasing percentage of metal in metal-

glass composite. The average maximum load for different volume fractions is given in the table 

below. As the amount of metal microspheres increases in the composite the total bonding 

between metal and glass microspheres was reduced causing low mechanical strength.

2.5.2 Discussion of the results:  

From the data presented in the table and in curves following conclusions can be drawn: 

1. Introduction of metal spheres always decreases the strength indicating that the bond between 

metal-glass spheres is weaker than the glass-glass spheres.  

2. The reduction in the strength is more pronounced after a certain volume fraction (~10%) of 

metal spheres.  

3. For the same composition Ni alloy system is stronger than the Co alloy system.   

Microscope images of the fractured surfaces throw some light on the possible causes of the 

behavior described above. The pictures clearly show that in metal-glass sphere system there is 

much less interfacial penetration than in the fused glass sphere case; in the later system at the 

sintering temperature used, the two contacting spherical surfaces fuse to produce a circular bond 

area of considerable diameter; this is the neck shaped growth between two glass microspheres. 

(Fig. 24 ). For the metal-glass case there is negligible mass diffusion from one sphere to other. A 

large decrease in the strength for more than critical metal percentage is probably due the reason 

that at these large concentrations there are significant numbers of metal-metal contact paths 

which are the weakest non-bonding links for fracture propagation. Also, large metal 

concentration diminishes the probability of contact and therefore fusion between glass 



37 

 

microspheres. The difference between the properties of Co and Ni system is probably also has to 

do with the nature of metal-glass bond. Microscopic images (Figs 40) show that the surface of Ni 

spheres is less shiny and spotty leading us to believe that in this case there is a formation of thin 

porous film of NiO which then fuses with the surface of glass spheres. As a matter of fact 

oxidizing the metal before sintering is well-known technique for improving the adhesion in 

glass-metal seals
 [28]

.

Chapter 3: Hollow-metal-sphere Synthetic Foam 

 

3.1 Preparation of hollow-metal-sphere synthetic foam 

 

The metallic hollow spheres used here were expanded polystyrol spheres with steel coating 

manufactured by GLEICH GMBH (Dresden, Germany). The average diameter of the spheres 

was 2.9 mm and the thickness of the shell was 70 microns. The apparent density of the hollow 

metal spheres was 0.5206 g/cm
3
. Two different methods were used to prepare lightweight 

material with hollow spheres embedded in a plastic resin: conventional method and an improved 

method.  

3.1.1 Conventional Method: The metal spheres were spread inside a cardboard mold box and 

then the resin was poured over the spheres. The resin was prepared by mixing 90% (by volume) 

of Biresin LS epoxy with 9 - 11% of hardener. The mixture was stirred carefully at room 

temperature (18-25°C) to a homogeneous state. The resin wets the macro spheres effectively due 

to its low viscosity. The curing process was done by keeping the mold inside the oven for 2 

hours at 80°C followed by a slow cooling process. The synthetic block thus obtained was cut to 

small rectangular shape blocks for mechanical testing.  The cutting was performed in a machine 

equipped with high speed cutting disc. The composite material is not very hard to cut due to 

softness of thin shell and plastic. While cutting the foam for preparing samples of required size 

for strength measurement it was observed that there were many voids in the synthetic foam so 

obtained. Figure 41 shows the general aspect of the specimens cut for strength measurements and 

Figure 45 shows the voids in the specimens prepared by the conventional method. The density of 

the samples obtained from conventional method was 0.4146 g/cm
3
.  

A table top cut-off machine by Struers was used for cutting the specimen. The cutting head of the 

machine was powered by a motor. A clamping device was provided for the fixation of samples. 

The cutting head was lowered using an adjustable side lever and an external circulating coolant 

was provided for lubrication. The samples were placed between the clamping device and cut into 

small rectangular bars. 

  



39 

 

 

Figure 41: Cut samples of hollow macro sphere synthetic foam 

3.1.2 Improved Method: In order to avoid voids during preparation, we introduced a stainless 

steel wire net in the mold and the net was kept fixed in the position while pouring the resin. The 

mesh size in the net is smaller than the diameter of the spheres and thus spheres cannot pass the 

net while the liquid resin can pass. The net was placed over the spheres. Another change in this 

method is that after pouring the mixer of resin and hardener and filling the mould to cover the 

spheres and slightly over the net, the filled mould was left to cure at room temperature for 2-3 

hours. This step reduces formation of large bubbles that happens when curing directly at high 

temperature. After this initial curing at room temperature, the mould with the net was subjected 

to the same curing procedure as the conventional method. Specimens obtained by this improved 

method were found to have little or no voids and were denser. The density of the specimens was 

0.6433 g/cm
3
, higher than the specimens obtained from conventional method.    

 

 



40 

 

3.2 Mechanical Strength testing procedure 

 

The three point bending test was employed to determine the mechanical strength of synthetic 

foam. The mechanical testing machine used for this testing was Shimadzu, in which a three point 

bending arrangement was mounted. The rectangular sample of synthetic foam was kept in such a 

way that the lower part of the specimen was provided with two supports and the load was applied 

at the top center of the sample. A photograph of the three point bending setup is shown below. 

 

 

 Figure 42: Three-point bending of Hollow millimeter size sphere Synthetic foam 

 

The machine settings were done using the controller; the loading speed of the piston was set to 

0.5 mm/s. After placing the sample, Autograph software was used to start the testing. The 

applied load was not uniform due the roughness of the surface. The machine automatically stops 

the testing when the sample is broken. The data obtained through mechanical testing was 

retrieved form the computer. The load vs. deflection curve was obtained for five samples.  



41 

 

3.3 Results and Discussion 

 

The load vs. deflection curves of the two sets (with voids and without voids) of samples prepared 

are given below (Graphs 10 and 11 respectively). The maximum flexural strength, modulus of 

rupture, of the samples was determined from the data using the standard formula:

Table 7: Dimensions and modulus of rupture for synthetic foam without voids 

 



43 

 

The data in the tables 6 and 7 clearly shows that the maximum flexural strength (modulus of 

rupture) for synthetic foam without voids, using the improved method, was about twice that of 

synthetic foam with voids. The void reduces the cross-sectional area and acts as a failure 

initiator. 

 

Figure 45: Hollow millimeter size sphere Synthetic foam with void 

 The presence of voids increases the crack propagation diminishing the mechanical strength of 

synthetic foam. Increasing void content reduces the flexural strength by acting both on the 

initiation and propagation stages of failure. In the first set prepared by conventional method the 

average modulus of rupture was 7.8 MPa, whereas the second set prepared by improved method 

gave 14.3 MPa as the average value for the modulus.

Chapter 4: Conclusion 

The mechanical strength of two different composite materials was determined. The first porous 

composite material prepared from metal-glass microsphere was subjected to piston-on-three-

sphere test to determine the maximum fracture strength. The strength diminished as the amount 

of metal microspheres in the metal-glass composite was increased. The bonding between metal 

and glass microsphere in the composite material was found to be different than between two 

glass microspheres. The increase in the amount of metal microspheres in the composite material 

reduces the bonding among the metal and glass microspheres. In the second composite, hollow 

millimeter size metal spheres and an epoxy resin were cured to develop synthetic foam. The 

improved preparation technique led to synthetic foam without voids. Three-Point-Bending test 

was employed to calculate modulus of rupture of the synthetic foam. The mechanical strength of 

the foam prepared from improved technique was two times higher than that of the foam prepared 

by the normal method.
