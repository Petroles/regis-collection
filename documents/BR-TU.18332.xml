resumo 
 

 

Ao longo das últimas décadas, as Redes Metalo-Orgânicas (MOFs), 
conhecidas também por Polímeros de Coordenação, têm atraído atenções dos 
investigadores de todas as partes do mundo devido às suas arquiteturas 
fascinantes e propriedades únicas. Estes materiais multidimensionais têm 
encontrado potenciais aplicações em áreas distintas: armazenamento e 
separação de gases, troca iónica, catálise, magnetismo, em sensores óticos, 
entre outras. 
O grupo de investigação em MOFs da Universidade de Aveiro tem preparado 
novos materiais a partir da combinação de ligandos orgânicos com grupos 
fosfonato e, principalmente, lantanídeos. Esta dissertação descreve as 
descobertas mais recentes nesta área envolvendo a síntese de MOFs 
multidimensionais baseados em quatro moléculas com grupos fosfonato. Os 
ligandos orgânicos usados neste projeto foram desenhados e preparados após 
seleção e otimização das condições reacionais e métodos de síntese. Reações 
entre estes ligandos orgânicos e terras-raras levaram à formação de várias 
famílias de MOFs 1D, 2D e 3D. A preparação destes materiais envolveu o uso 
de métodos de síntese distintos: síntese hidro(solvo)térmica, assistida por 
micro-ondas ou ultrassons, “one-pot” e ionotérmica. A seleção criteriosa dos 
ligandos orgânicos mostrou ter um papel fundamental nas arquiteturas finais 
dos materiais: enquanto as moléculas com grupos fosfonato mais flexíveis 
originaram estruturas 1D, 2D e 3D densas, um dos ligandos com a sua 
estrutura mais rígida levou à formação de uma MOF 3D porosa. A estrutura 
cristalina de todos os materiais foi resolvida através de difração de raios-X de 
pós ou monocristal. Todos os materiais foram ainda caracterizados usando 
várias técnicas em estado sólido (FT-IV, microscopia eletrónica (SEM e EDS), 
RMN em estado sólido, análise elementar e termogravimétrica). Algumas 
MOFs exibiram uma estabilidade térmica e robustez notáveis até 
aproximadamente 400 ºC. 
As propriedades de algumas MOFs foram investigadas. Estudos de 
fotoluminescência revelaram que os ligandos orgânicos selecionados são 
sensibilizadores apropriados para os catiões Tb

3+
 levando à formação de 

materiais emissores de luz verde intensa. A supressão de grupos “quencher” 
O?H, através de processos de deuteração ou desidratação melhorou 
substancialmente a fotoluminescência dos matérias contendo catiões Eu

3+
. 

Algumas MOFs mostraram elevada atividade catalítica, em meio heterogéneo, 
e uma excelente regioseletividade na reação “ring-opening” do óxido de 
estireno (PhEtO) com metanol (100% de conversão de PhEtO a 55 ºC durante 
30 minutos). A MOF porosa foi usada em processos de separação de gases. 
Este composto exibiu uma boa capacidade para separar propano de propileno. 
Este material contendo catiões K

+
 no interior da sua rede exibiu uma afinidade 

elevada para CO2 mostrando também capacidade para separar acetileno deste 
gás inimigo do ambiente.

abstract 

 
During the last few decades, Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), also known 
as Coordination Polymers, have attracted worldwide research attentions due to 
their incremented fascinating architectures and unique properties. These multi-
dimensional materials have been potential applications in distinct areas: gas 
storage and separation, ion exchange, catalysis, magnetism, in optical sensors, 
among several others. 
The MOF research group at the University of Aveiro has prepared MOFs from 
the combination of phosphonate organic primary building units (PBUs) with, 
mainly, lanthanides. This thesis documents the last findings in this area 
involving the synthesis of multidimensional MOFs based on four di- or tripodal 
phosphonates ligands. The organic PBUs were designed and prepared by 
selecting and optimizing the best reaction conditions and synthetic routes. The 
self-assembly between phosphonate PBUs and rare-earths cations led to the 
formation of several 1D, 2D and 3D families of isotypical MOFs. The 
preparation of these materials was achieved by using distinct synthetic 
approaches: hydro(solvo)thermal, microwave- and ultrasound-assisted, one-pot 
and ionothermal synthesis. The selection of the organic PBUs showed to have 
an important role in the final architectures: while flexible phosphonate ligands 
afforded 1D, 2D and dense 3D structures, a large and rigid organic PBU 
isolated a porous 3D MOF. The crystal structure of these materials was 
successfully unveiled by powder or single-crystal X-ray diffraction. All 
multidimensional MOFs were characterized by standard solid-state techniques 
(FT-IR, electron microscopy (SEM and EDS), solid-state NMR, elemental and 
thermogravimetric analysis). Some MOF materials exhibited remarkable 
thermal stability and robustness up to ca. 400 ºC. 
The intrinsic properties of some MOFs were investigated. Photoluminescence 
studies revealed that the selected organic PBUs are suitable sensitizers of Tb

3+
 

leading to the isolation of intense green-emitting materials. The suppression of 
the O?H quenchers by deuteration or dehydration processes improves 
substantially the photoluminescence of the optically-active Eu

3+
-based 

materials. Some MOF materials exhibited high heterogeneous catalytic activity 
and excellent regioselectivity in the ring-opening reaction of styrene oxide 
(PhEtO) with methanol (100% conversion of PhEtO at 55 ºC for 30 min). The 
porous MOF material was employed in gas separation processes. This 
compound showed the ability to separate propane over propylene. The ion-
exchanged form of this material (containing K

+
 cations into its network) 

exhibited higher affinity for CO2 being capable to separate acetylene over this 
environment non-friendly gas.

1.1. Supramolecular Chemistry 

 

For several decades, since 1828, date in which Friedrich Wöhler synthesized urea, 

molecular chemistry have developed a huge number of powerful and highly sophisticated 

methods to construct and prepare complex molecular structures through the creation or 

break of covalent bonds between atoms while carefully controlling the reaction conditions. 

During several years, organic chemistry grew very quickly, becoming one of the most 

important areas of chemistry. After several efforts, Robert B. Woodward and Albert 

Eschenmozer, supported by a great number of collaborators, synthesized the so known 

Vitamin B12.
1 Nevertheless, molecular chemistry has just concerned in covalent bonds 

forgetting other interactions. 

Worldwide Chemists have been interested in other non-covalent interactions and, 

consequently, a new direction in chemistry, called supramolecular chemistry, has gained a 

tremendous power in the last decades. This fact has been supported and documented in 

several published monographs.1-5 The term supramolecular chemistry was introduced, for 

the first time, in 1978 by Jean-Marie Lehn, who won, with the two reputable researchers 

Donald J. Cram and Charles J. Pedersen, the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1987 due to the 

high progress that they have developed in this field.3 Thus, supramolecular chemistry is 

defined as “chemistry beyond the molecule”. In other words, this field concerns with the 

study of molecular ensembles and intermolecular bonds.6-7 Figure 1.1 illustrates a 

supramolecular complex achieved through intermolecular interactions.  

 

 
Figure 1.1 – Formation of a supramolecular complex from the self-assembly, through 
intermolecular interactions, of molecular units. 

 

 

Supramolecular chemistry is a relatively recent area, which has grown rapidly. 

Nowadays, this area has becoming very strong due to the collaboration between 

researchers belonging to distinct interdisciplinary disciplines (chemistry, physics, biology 

and technology). As mentioned above, supramolecular chemistry is focused on the 

construction of functional and highly complex chemical systems resulting of non-covalent 

connections between molecular components.3,5,8-9 It is emphasized:

- hydrogen bonding 

- ?-? stacking 

- van der Waals forces 

- ion-ion interactions 

- electrostatic interactions 

- ion-dipole interactions 

- dipole-dipole interactions 

- cation-? interactions 

Compared to the high energetic covalent bonds (200-400 kJ mol-1), the non-

covalent interactions have smaller energies: i) 4-40 kJ mol-1 for ion-ion electrostatic 

interactions; ii) 1-80 kJ mol-1 for hydrogen bonding; and iii) less than 4 kJ mol-1 for van der 

Waals forces, dipole-dipole and ion-dipole interactions.2 Although weak, some of the 

numerous interactions contained in supermolecules, the subject of study in supramolecular 

chemistry, have a great influence in the final properties of them. 

Within the supramolecular chemistry area, one of the most important sub-areas is, 

undoubtedly, the supramolecular coordination chemistry. This comprises the generation of 

supramolecular coordination systems possessing metal ions centers embedded in their 

structure. The existence of both organic and inorganic components confers, in several 

cases, more than one property to the complex allowing its application in distinct fields.10-11 

In the literature it is possible to find a considerable number of supramolecular coordination 

complexes. One of these families is composed of highly crystalline and, sometimes, porous 

architectures normally known as Coordination Polymers, Metal-Organic Frameworks 

(MOFs), Porous Coordination Polymers (PCPs) or Coordination Frameworks. 

 

 

1.2. Metal-Organic Frameworks 

 

Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), also known as coordination polymers, are one 

of the most recent classes of functional materials and a hot topic which has been attracted 

worldwide research attention. Tremendous efforts have been devoted towards the 

chemistry of new and fascinating architectures, some of which exhibiting interesting and 

unique properties. Noteworthy, these materials are on the interface between molecular 

coordination chemistry and materials science. The large number of reviews published in 

the most prestigious scientific journals, scientific papers, monographs and books, have 

reflected the high interest from the scientific community around these materials.12-46 

 

 

1.2.1. The Genesis and Terminology of the Name  
  

Since the appearance of crystalline, multidimentional and functional coordination 

materials, their nomenclature is a hot topic. However, in some scientific meetings, 



Metal-Organic Frameworks   

 

                                                           5 
 

worldwide researchers, working in this field, still did not achieve a consensus. This family 

of materials has been identified as Coordination Polymers (CPs), Metal-Organic 

Frameworks (MOFs), Coordination Networks, Porous Coordination Polymers (PCPs), 

Hybrid Organic-inorganic Materials, Organic Zeolite Analogues, among others.19,47-48 

 The term CP is usually used to describe a class of materials formed by an extended 

network of metal centers or clusters connected, through coordination bonds, to organic 

bridging ligands. This term is too vague because it does not refer to the final structure or 

morphology of the solid material. For example, CPs does not clarify if the compound is 

crystalline or amorphous, or if it is porous or dense. Thus, very often the term MOF has 

been used to define crystalline and highly porous compounds which involve strong metal-

to-ligand interactions resulting usually in three-dimensional fascinating structures with 

high thermal and mechanical stability.18-19 

 Because the terms CPs and MOFs provide some ambiguity, several efforts have 

been done in order to have a decision about the nomenclature of this type of materials. In 

2009, Biradha, Ramanan and Vittall published a pedagogic work relating about this theme. 

Although some explanations about both CPs and MOFs, the uncertainty about which term 

should be used for 1D, 2D or 3D crystalline coordination materials remained.48 Three years 

later, in 2012, the nomenclature of CPs versus MOFs (after an initial project of the IUPAC 

(International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) Inorganic Chemistry division called 

“Coordination polymers and metal-organic frameworks: terminology and nomenclature 

guidelines”) was also discussed in a scientific meeting counting with the participation of 

several experts of this research area.47 From this discussion, it was reported two hierarchies 

of solid state coordination chemistry. In Figure 1.2 is depicted one of these hierarchies 

where CPs and MOFs are contained. Despite this attempt, it is still not clear what is the 

appropriated term to use for the nomenclature of crystalline coordination materials.

for IUPAC to define the terms Coordination Polymers and Metal-Organic 
Frameworks. Reproduced from reference 47.

  In this thesis it will be considered as MOFs all the crystalline compounds, which 

result from the self-assembly of organic linkers (in our case, phosphonate-based organic 

molecules) with metal centers (lanthanides), independently of their dimensionality or 

porosity. 

 

1.2.2. Interests in MOFs 
 

In the last years, the interest in both CPs and MOFs has grown exponentially. 

Searches in the ISI Web of Knowledge database can easily unveil a huge number of 

scientific papers reporting the synthesis, characterization and the properties of CP- or 

MOF-type materials. The first report describing the design and synthesis of a new class of 

scaffolding-like materials, using zinc and tetracyanotetraphenylmethane as the primary 

building units (PBUs) was published by Hoskins &amp;amp; Robson in 1990. This work constitutes 

a preliminary attempt to construct, through strong and highly directional coordinative 

bonds (several hundreds of KJ mol-1), multi-dimensional diamondoid-type metal-organic 

frameworks. This pioneering work has been motivated worldwide researchers to focus 

their attention in the design and synthesis of new materials, resulting from the self-

assembly of organic molecules and metallic centers. These compounds compose the first 

generation of MOFs.49 Evolving in time, scientists belonging to this field started to use 

secondary building units (second generation)50 passing then for the production of large 

metal-organic polyhedral cages (third generation networks known as MOPs).51 

 Consequence of the progressive evolution on the production of this class of 

compounds has been reflected on the exponential growth of publications in international 

journals since 1990 (Figure 1.3).52

Polymer(s)” and/or “Metal-Organic Framework(s)” in their titles, abstracts or

Metal-Organic Frameworks   

 

                                                           7 
 

When compared with other microporous inorganic materials, as for instance zeolites, 

the architecture and functionalization of the pores of MOFs are easier to be controlled due 

to the flexible design of the organic component which is amenable to chemical 

modifications through organic synthesis.53-54 This is not the only advantage of MOFs when 

compared with other systems. MOFs have another features and properties overlapping to 

other structures, of those we may highlight: i) the considerable resistance to structural 

collapse due to the very strong coordination bonds; ii) MOF-type materials are more 

porous and possess world records in terms of surface area; and iii) complexes with 

geometrically well-defined structures. The latter characteristic is extremely important to 

promote the isolation of materials with high crystallinity, and is an essential criterion for 

the establishment of structure-property relationships.19,55 All these characteristics in MOFs 

can lead to entering properties such as porosity (to store and capture guests), high internal 

surface area (with the possibility to have functional groups available to originate catalytic 

processes), conductivity, magnetism, among many others. 

 

1.2.3. Building Components for the Preparation of MOFs 
  

The design and synthesis of MOFs involve a very interesting intellectual challenge 

because the final architecture strongly depends of the combination of two distinct 

components: metal centers and organic ligands. These are known as primary building units 

(PBUs). The number and orientation of the bonding sites (coordination numbers and 

coordination geometries) of the PBUs are responsible for some features of the material 

such as shape, pore size and topology. The dimensionality (1D, 2D or 3D), other feature of 

the final structure of MOF materials, also depends of the employed PBUs. Figure 1.4 

depicts the process to produce the resulting multidimensional MOFs.

2D and 3D).

1.2.3.1. Metal Centers 

  

During the last two decades, worldwide research groups interested in the 

preparation of MOFs have selected the metallic centers concerning their both final 

structure and properties. Therefore having into account the structure-properties relationship 

of the resulting MOF materials, a vast number of metallic elements from the periodic table 

have been employed in their preparation, such as: alkaline earths metals (i.e., Ca2+, Mg2+ 

and Sr2+), transition metals (i.e., Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+) and rare-earth metals, 

including lanthanides (i.e., La3+, Ce3+, Eu3+, Gd3+ and Tb3+).13 Due to their different 

geometries, metallic centers display an important role in terms of the dimensionality and 

topology of the final structures of MOFs. In the case of transition metals, according to their 

oxidation state, they may possess coordination number (CN) varying from 2 to 7, giving 

rise to different coordination geometries (Figure 1.5).56-57 

 

 

Figure 1.5 – Some coordination geometries of transition metals (CN = coordination 
number). 

 

 

Rare-earth elements have been widely employed in the synthesis of 

multidimensional MOFs.24,34,58 Because during my PhD project I only used this type of 

metal elements, mainly lanthanides, in this topic it will be provided a more detailed 

information about their characteristics and properties. 

According to IUPAC, rare-earths are considered the elements with the atomic 

number 21 (Sc), 39 (Y) and 57 (La) to 71 (Lu). Additionally, the elements from 58 (Ce) to 

71 (Lu) are also called as lanthanides. The occurrence of the La to Lu lanthanide elements 

is not common. Therefore, these are more abundant in Australia, Brazil, China and 

Malaysia, being these the major exporting countries.59-61 In terms of solubility, lanthanide 

minerals are very soluble in water, however, their abundance is very low in all natural

waters. These elements do not present, generally, toxicity for Life, with exception of 

promethium (radioactive element) which does not occur naturally.59

 Lanthanides have some characteristics in their chemistry differencing them from 

the d-block elements and, consequently, render them more reactive than transition metals:

i) the 4f orbitals of the Ln3+ do not have a direct effect on the bonding, due to the 

shielding by the 5s2 and 5p6 orbitals. This feature make their magnetic and 

spectroscopy properties largely uninfluenced by the ligand;  

ii) very sharp electronic peaks in their electronic spectra when compared with those of 

transitions metals;  

iii) lanthanide elements prefer anion ligands with high electronegative donor atoms 

(i.e., oxygen or fluorine atoms);  

iv)  they originate hydrated compounds, leading to an uncertainty to assign 

coordination numbers;  

v) at neutral pH, it occurs a precipitation of insoluble hydroxide lanthanides. This 

process does not may happen in this case of the presence of complexing species;  

vi) the chemistry of lanthanides is, mostly, based on the 3+ oxidation state in, certainly, 

aqueous reaction solutions;  

vii) in opposition to what happens with transition metals, Ln=O or Ln?N multiple 

bonds do not form.  

In Table 1.1 are described some properties of the lanthanide elements (Ln3+ ionic 

radii, electronic configurations and oxidation states).60

Metal-Organic Frameworks

Lanthanide ions (Ln3+), as represented in Table 1.1, are characterized by a gradual 

filling of the 4f orbitals: from 4f0 for lanthanum (La3+) to 4f14 for lutetium (Lu3+) cations. 

These electronic configurations [Xe] 4fn (n = 0 - 14) originate a variety of energy levels 

(Figure 1.6), leading to complex optical properties.34,62 Based on the emission of 

lanthanides, the metals have been applied for the preparation of several devices in different 

fields: lasers, telecommunication (optical fibers), medical imaging (NIR-spectroscopy), 

LED (lighting devices) and as luminescent probes in fluoroimmunology. The diagram of 

Figure 1.7 depicts the major photonic areas where lanthanide-based materials have been 

applied.63 

The lanthanide contraction, in other words, the decrease of the Ln3+ ionic radius 

from Lanthanum to Lutetium is attributed to the poor screening of the 4f electrons. This 

leads to that neighboring lanthanides exhibit very similar, but not identical, chemical 

properties. The lanthanide contraction promotes some effects in the coordination number 

of the central atom and, consequently, in the coordination geometry.64-66

applications, of lanthanide-based materials. Reproduced from reference 63. 

 

 

Compared with transition metals, lanthanides have completely different 

coordination geometries. The coordination environment of these elements tends to be more 

spherical in nature than those of transition metals. They exhibit a higher range of 

coordination numbers which usually varies between 6 and 12 (although coordination 

numbers of 2, 3 and 4 are known). Due to this fact, the use of lanthanides in the 

construction of MOFs creates additional difficulties in the control of the final structure. 

Nevertheless, the metal centers lead to unusual and remarkable topologies which cannot be 

designed with transition metals.58,63,67 In the Figure 1.8 are represented some coordination 

geometries of the lanthanide elements.

1.2.3.2. Organic Linker Components 

 

Many types of organic linkers have been employed in the construction of MOFs. 

These molecules are responsible for the bridges between metal centers. To originate a 

structure infinitely expanded the organic molecules have to be multidentate with, at least, 

two donor atoms such as O, S or N. The molecules differ from each other according their 

complexity and functional groups. They can be of aromatic or aliphatic nature and, 

sometimes, they contain heteroelements in their structure. In terms of functional groups the 

organic ligands must have at least two, which can be carboxylic acids, esters, amines, 

phosphonates, sulphonates, nitrile, pyridyl, imidazole, pyrazole, triazole and tetrazoles 

groups (Figure 1.9) or even a combination of them. The shape (rigid or not) and length 

(i.e., distance between coordinating groups) further determine some properties of the final 

structures.18,28,68-69

preparation of MOFs.

 A careful selection of the organic ligands to construct a MOF is essential, because 

these may display a very important role in the functionality and porosity of the resulting 

materials and, additionally, may provide the possibility of post-synthetic modification of 

the MOF material.70 The majority of the research groups working in this area opt for 

commercially available organic molecules. Their availability may be an advantage for a 

fast and cheaper preparation of MOFs. Therefore, it has been more frequent to find 

published scientific works reporting the synthesis of MOFs composed of commercially 

available organic ligands than those produced from designed and prepared ones by 

researchers in the own laboratories using conventional (step-by-step from the ligand 

precursors to the desired linker) and non-conventional in situ synthesis. In the later, the 

organic precursors are converted in situ into the final molecule which coordinates to the

metal centers. Several processes explain this in situ preparation: hydroxylation, 

decarboxylation, alkylation, and hydrolysis.69,71-72 Although more time consuming and, 

sometimes, more expensive, the synthesis of new organic ligands may confer to the 

resulting MOF the desired properties. In order to explain the relationship between the 

properties of the resulting materials and the nature and structure of the designed and 

synthesized organic ligands, the MOF research group University of Aveiro published a 

critical review discussing this topic.73 Having this into account, during my PhD project I 

prepared four organic phosphonate-based organic PBUs (chapter 2) to be used in the 

preparation of functional and multidimentional MOFs (chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6). 

 As mentioned above, a huge number of organic linkers have been used for the self-

assembly of MOFs. In the Figures 1.10, 1.11, 1.12 and 1.13 are represented some of them 

(commercially available or prepared by some research groups) illustrating the functionality 

and size diversity of the organic PBUs.27,57,74-100 Examples of phosphonate-based ligands

1.2.4. Synthetic Methods for the Preparation of MOFs 
  

PBUs are, undoubtedly, very important components concerning the crystalline 

structure of the resulting MOF materials. Nevertheless, other parameters (i.e., reaction 

conditions and synthetic methodologies) are also essential for the construction of these 

compounds. The specific reaction conditions that can be changed are (Figure 1.14):  

i) metal source (i.e., nitrate, chloride, oxide or acetate);  

ii) molar ratio/concentration of the PBUs in solution;  

iii) solvent (e.g., water, DMF, DMSO, methanol, ethanol or a mixture of them);

iv)  reaction time (depending of the synthetic approach employed, the reaction time 

may vary from few minutes to several weeks);  

v) pressure (ambient pressure, if the reaction occurs in an open reactor; autogenous 

pressure if a closed vessel is selected, or controlled pressure when the reaction 

occurs in a microwave-assisted equipment);  

vi)  temperature (from ambient to 250 ºC); 

vii) pH (adjust with acids or bases, as for instance, HCl or NaOH).  

Although all the reaction conditions display an important role in the preparation of 

MOFs, it was found that there is a relationship between the last two (temperature and pH) 

and the final structure of these materials.18,101-103 

 

 

Figure 1.14 – Reaction variables that may be optimized for the preparation of MOFs.  
 
 
 Depending of the final purpose, multidimentional MOFs may be prepared 

employing different and distinct synthetic methodologies. Some of them (i.e., microwave- , 

ultrasound-assisted and one-pot synthesis) are faster, being more attractive for industry. 

However, the possibility to obtain the desired materials as large single-crystals is very 

often a difficult task to achieve. In opposition, slow diffusion and hydro(solvo)thermal 

approaches lead to large single-crystal particles, but they are, normally, time-consuming 

methodologies. In the following paragraphs some details of various synthetic 

methodologies will be described. 

 

Slow diffusion can be employed when MOFs are pretended as large single-crystals 

(fundamental for X-ray diffraction studies). This methodology consists on the slowly 

“bring into contact” of different solutions containing reactive species (organic ligands and 

metal centers). Therefore, this method consists in the preparation of saturated solutions 

(having different density) containing the metal salts and organic ligands dissolved in a 

suitable solvent or a mixture of solvents. After the first solution being transferred for a 

suitable reaction vessel, a less dense solvent is added. Finally the second solution is 

transferred to the vessel and a system composed of three layers is formed. This reaction 

system mixture is kept in an open, or partially open, system at ambient or low temperature

while the layers start to mixture, leading to the contact of the organic and inorganic 

components and, consequently, to the formation of the MOF material. Although very 

simple, this synthetic approach is typically very slow, taking several days, weeks or even 

months.104-107 

 

Hydro(solvo)thermal synthesis was originally 

developed for the synthesis of zeolites. This 

method is, undoubtedly, the most widely used in 

the self-assembly of multidimensional MOFs. The 

prepared reaction mixtures are transferred to a 

closed system (autoclave) and then placed inside 

an oven. The operation temperature range is 

between 80 and 250 ºC. Sometimes it is necessary 

to perform heating and cooling temperature ramps 

to isolate large single-crystals. The system is under 

autogenous pressure. Besides water, another 

solvents are used such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), 

toluene, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), among 

several others. DMF has become a popular solvent 

due to its high boiling point and capacity to dissolve metal salts and organic ligands, 

mainly carboxylic acids.108-110 

  

Ionothermal synthesis was developed by Morris in 2004.111 This recent methodology 

employs ionic liquids (ILs) and eutectic mixtures which provides different reaction 

conditions when compared to the conventional solvo(hydro)thermal synthesis. ILs act at 

the same time as the reaction solvent, template, or charge-compensating group. Because 

there are a large number of possible binary ionic liquids and eutectic mixtures, this method 

have been used in the construction of several porous materials by selecting solvents with 

different properties.112-114 

 

Microwave-assisted synthesis (MWAS) is not very 

common, when compared, for instance, with the 

hydro(solvo)thermal method. Very interesting results 

have been, however, published by using this approach. 

Researchers have preferred this synthetic method 

because it is a simpler and energy-efficient heating 

process, it allows the reduction of the crystallization 

times, improve yields, the possibility to control the 

morphology of the structure, phase selectivity, 

narrow particle distribution and also allows an easy 

variation of the reaction parameters. This method has 

the main disadvantage of not typically allowing the

isolation of large single crystals for X-ray diffraction.109,115-117 

 

Electrochemical Synthesis is not very usual for the preparation of MOFs. This approach 

consists in an electron transference between the electrode and the electrolyte (ionic 

conductor) or species in solution. Müller and collaborators prepared the well-known 

HKUST-1 using an electrochemical cell containing copper plates as the anode, a solution 

of benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid in methanol and a copper cathode. It was applied a 

voltage of 12-19 V and 1.3 A of intensity. After 150 minutes the desired HKUST-1 MOF 

was isolated.118 Some years latter Van Assche et al. reported the preparation of the same 

material as thin HKUST-1 layers.119 This method has been used on industrial scale to 

produce MOF materials. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ultrasound-assisted synthesis (USAS), as well as MWAS, allows an easy adaptability of 

the reaction conditions tested in the conventional heating approaches. USAS have been 

widely used due to its capacity to isolate 

MOFs as phase-pure, with homogeneous 

particle size and morphology and in 

rapid synthesis kinetics. Therefore, 

ultrasonication promotes homogeneous 

nucleation in very short crystallization 

periods of time owing the creation, 

growth and collapse of an acoustic 

cavitation that leads to very high 

temperatures (5000-25000 K) and 

pressures and the possibility for fast heating and cooling processes.120-123 USAS have been 

seen as a very good synthetic approach for the preparation of nano-sized MOFs.121,124-125

One-pot synthesis is, probably, the easiest synthetic 

methodology used for the production of MOFs. One-

pot approach is based on the stirring of the reactants 

(organic ligands and metal centers) at ambient pressure 

and temperature (being this latter parameter easily 

altered for higher values using, as for instance, a 

regular heating plate). This bench methodology has 

gained relevant research interests due to its simplicity 

and low energy consumption. Additionally, the 

possibility to prepare MOFs at ambient temperature, 

during short periods of time with particle size ranging 

from few nanometers to several hundred of 

micrometers, boosted in recent years the use of this 

approach as a strong synthetic alternative.126-132 

 

 

1.3. Properties and Potential Applications of MOFs 

 

Multidimensional MOFs have found potential applications in several and distinct 

areas due to their unique properties. In the next sub-sections it will be described in more 

detail some of the properties of MOFs which were investigated during my PhD project: i) 

porosity; ii) heterogeneous catalytic activity; and iii) luminescence. 

 

 

1.3.1. Porosity  
 

In opposition that described for other solid-state materials (e.g., active carbons), 

MOFs are widely known by the close control over their crystalline structures. The quest for 

novel and functional multidimentional MOFs is an enormous challenge having attracted 

the interest of several worldwide research groups. Porosity is, undoubtedly, the most 

desired property for MOF materials with researchers working in this field have been 

looking for materials: i) capable to store species (e.g., CH4, H2); ii) for gas separation 

processes (as for instance, retention of CO2 from a mixture of gases); iii) with large pores 

to allow the interaction between catalytic active sites and some molecules to be 

transformed; and iv) to accommodate biologically active molecules to be used, as for 

instance, in drug delivering processes. For that, MOFs should have large and accessible 

channels without self-penetration, be charged (typically anionic) to allow the ion exchange 

and be chemically stable when in contact with solvents, mainly water, for  their application 

as functional materials.133 According to IUPAC notation porous materials are classified 

into several types based on their width of the pore: i) microporous (20 Å or less); ii) 

mesoporous (in the range of 20-500 Å); and iii) macroporous (pores with sizes larger than

500 Å).134 Besides porosity, other important requirement for MOFs is their zeolite-type 

behavior for reversible exchange of guest chemical species (Figure 1.20).32 Nevertheless, 

porosity is the basis to occur the zeolitic behavior in MOFs, as for instance, in ion 

exchange, adsorption and desorption, enantiomer separation or selective catalytic 

processes.

The ability to separate metallic cations using large enough organic ligands to create 

porosity, while maintaining structural robustness, is a great challenge. Keeping this in 

mind, scientists have carefully selected, from commercially sources or designed and 

prepared by themselves, a large number of organic PBUs. Omar Yaghi, very often called 

as godfather of MOFs, and coworkers published a very interesting work reporting the 

rational design and reticular synthesis of a family of open-framework MOFs, known as 

IRMOFs (isoreticular metal-organic frameworks), based on the extension of MOF-5 

(Figure 1.21).54 For that, it was used Zn2+ cations and several organic ligands (the 

commercially available terephthalic acid (BDC) and other organic linkers which could 

expand the pores while maintaining the cubic topology of the parent materials).34,75 

Some group leaders, as for instance Susumu Kitagawa, Gerard Férey, Joseph Hupp, 

Jeffrey Long, Martin Schröder, among others, have dedicated enormous effort into the 

preparation of functional porous MOFs. Having into account the porosity of MOFs, 

various intriguing porous structures have been reported. Table 1.2 lists known porous 

MOFs produced since 1999 until 2013. The crystalline structure of such materials are 

depicted in Figure 1.22.45,54,135-168

1.3.1.1. Methane and Hydrogen storage 

  

The prime challenge of the 21st century faced by chemists is, undoubtedly, energy 

storage: i) hydrogen appears as an environmentally friendly energy carrier and clean fuel; 

and ii) methane, a component of natural gas, seems to be an attractive fuel, since it is very 

abundant and its burning process is clean. Therefore, both gases are excellent and realistic 

alternatives to the common fossil fuels. Additionally, the necessity to store and to use them 

as fuels in a cheap, safe and convenient way is a great requirement and a great challenge.  



Chapter 1 

 

24                                                            
 

For that, several research groups have produced various porous MOF materials to 

facilitate the storage of H2 and CH4, as for instance, in automobiles while fulfilling the 

requirements mentioned above. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) published recently 

the following storage target values: for H2, at near-ambient temperature (-40 to 85 ºC) and 

amenable pressures (&amp;lt;100 bar), the target is 9.0 wt% and 81 g L-1 by 2015; for CH4 is 180 

(STP) cm3 cm-3 (25 ºC, 35 bar) (Note: STP means standard temperature and pressure).169  

Zeolites (exhibiting CH4 uptake below 100 (STP) cm
3 cm-3) and porous carbon 

materials (showing a CH4 uptake in the range of 50-160 (STP) cm
3 cm-3) possess good 

capacities in CH4 adsorption.
170-171 Although some porous carbon materials have values of 

methane uptake close of the DOE target, this type of compounds have, as strong limitation, 

the increase of their high surface area (? 2000 - 3500 m2 g-1).169 

One inconvenient to store the natural gas CH4 is based on its low energy density. 

This fact leads to a necessity to store it either at very high pressures as well as a liquid to 

use it in vehicles.172 Nevertheless, various researchers have reported that some MOFs have 

exhibited a great capacity to adsorb CH4. In 2000, Kitagawa et al. reported the preparation 

of [CuSiF6(4,4’-bpy)] MOF shown as a new potential inorganic-organic hybrid material to 

adsorb methane.138 Since then, dozens of MOF materials have been reported having high 

capacity to adsorb CH4, of which it is emphasized: HKUST-1,
173 MIL-101,173 USTA-20,167 

Nu-125,168 NOT-122174 and PCN-14.157 

Recently Yildirim et al. published a very interesting work reporting the capacity of 

six well-known MOFs (NU-11, NU-125, UTSA-20, PCN-14, Ni-MOF-74 (Ni-CPO-27) 

and HKUST-1) for CH4 uptake (Figure 1.23).
175 Investigations performed reveal that these 

porous materials present very good capacity towards CH4 adsorption. Although Ni-MOF-

74 can adsorb very high CH4 quantity, the commercially available in gram scale HKUST-

1, exceeds any value reported to date. At ambient temperature the volumetric CH4 uptake 

is about 230 cm3 cm-3 at 35 bar and 270 cm3 cm-3 at 65 bar. These values reach the new 

volumetric target recently set by the DOE, if the packing efficiency loss is ignored. Despite 

these excellent results, there are other issues to have into account, as for instance, the cost 

and the chemical stability of these materials. 

 Because H2 is a viable energy source to replace common fossil combustibles (one 

of the most responsible for the greenhouse effect), several research groups have dedicated 

enormous efforts in order to produce porous materials with capacity to store this gas in a 

safe and cheap manner and, consequently, use it as energy for vehicles. As for CH4, the H2 

storage requires specific conditions i) very high pressure gas; ii) liquid hydrogen; iii) 

intercalating of H2 in metals; iv) porous materials to adsorb H2.
134 MOF materials emerged 

as a very strong alternative to display the role as containers for H2 due to their high surface 

areas.

sizes (in order to allow the interaction of H2 with the wall of the MOF materials) and the 

incorporation of coordinatively unsaturated metal centers (to bind H2) are two important 

requirements to retain H2 molecules. Nevertheless, other strategies have been adopted to 

improve the ability of porous MOFs to uptake H2: i) postsynthetic processes;
159 ii) 

variation in the pore features;159,176-178 and iii) use of mixed crystals of known MOF 

materials prepared in different solvents.135    

To try understand about the mechanism of H2 adsorption in the pores of MOFs, 

Belof et al.179 evaluated how H2 binds in two indium frameworks: 

[In3O(C8O4H4)3(H2O)1.5(C3N2H3)(C3N2H4)0.5]·DMF·0.5(CH3CN) and [In3O(C16N2O8H6)-

1.5(H2O)3](H2O)3(NO3), initially prepared by Liu and collaborators (Figure 1.24).
180 It was 

shown that: i) the MOF material, alongside its high surface area, has a huge number of 

interdigitated pores; ii) open frameworks with low density MOFs allow H2 adsorption due 

to H2-H2 interactions which occur in the middle of the channels; and iii) the inner surface 

should have local polar groups in order to promote MOF-H2 interactions. This last 

characteristic is directly attributed to the properties of the organic PBUs. To support that, it 

was proved that the structure of Liu et al.180 containing an organic spacer with a N=N 

connection provides significant MOF-H2 interactions.

 Dietzel and collaborators prepared and investigated the ability of the dehydrated 

form of the 3D Ni-CPO-27 material towards H2 adsorption.
149 The porosity of this material 

was conserved after evacuation (at high temperatures) of the water molecules leading to an 

increase of its surface area. This process improves the accessibility of H2 to the unsaturated 

metal sites. The H2 uptake capacity of Ni-CPO-27 is of 1.8 wt% at 77 K.  

 Yaghi’s group isolated twelve zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), termed ZIF-

1 to -12), based on imidazolate-type organic ligands coordinated to Zn2+ or Co2+ metal 

cations.166 The crystalline structure of these materials consists in the net of seven distinct 

aluminosilicates zeolites (the tetrahedral Si(Al) and the bridging O element where replaced 

by Zn2+ or Co2+ and the imidazolate molecules). H2 uptake experiments were performed 

for both ZIF-8 and -11 showing reversible hydrogen behaviour. The H2 uptake for both 

materials was similar [145 cm3g-1 STP for ZIF-8 and 154 cm3g-1 STP for ZIF-11 (slightly 

higher due to its higher surface area)]. In high-pressure (up to 80 bar) at 77 K ZIF-8 

exhibited 350 cm3g-1 STP at 55 bar. 

 NOTT-n (where n = 1, 2, 3, …) porous materials, known due to their polyhedral 

cages with different sizes, have been prepared by the group led by Schröder and their H2 

uptake capacities have been measured. NOTT-112, -116 and -122 produced from the self-

assembly of Cu2+ cations with different hexacarboxylate organic linkers showed interesting 

H2 uptake abilities.
156,174 Therefore, NOTT-112, -116 and -122 have H2 uptakes of 2.3 

wt%, 1.9 wt% and 2.6 wt%, respectively, at 77 K and 1 bar. Only few materials are able to 

adsorb amounts of H2 higher than that observed for NOTT-122 under the above mentioned 

conditions.174 

 In 2009, Mulfort et al. published a strategy to improve the H2 uptake in MOF 

materials.159 Their work consists in a post-synthesis procedure in order to convert pendent 

alcohols moieties to metal alkoxides (Figure 1.25). The as-prepared porous DO-MOF 

material (having in its structure Zn2+ metallic centers and two different organic ligands: a

tetracarbolylate and a bipyridine molecules) was added to a mixture composed of THF, to 

replace the guest solvent molecules of DMF, and an excess of Li+[O(CH3)3
-] in 

CH3CN/THF. After that, the H2 uptake capacity of the as-prepared DO-MOF, as well as 

the DO-MOF-Li, were investigated and the results suggested that at 77 K (1 atm) the DO-

MOF-Li material has a higher H2 uptake (1.32 wt%) than the original DO-MOF (1.23 

wt%).

1.3.1.2. CO2 Capture 

  

CO2 is the major responsible of the greenhouse effect in atmosphere. It is reported 

that during the last half century the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere increased from 

about 310 to over 380 ppm, being expected to achieve 550 ppm by 2050, even if CO2 

emissions may be stabilized in the next four decades.181-183 One of the consequences of the 

CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere is the global warming. This environmental problem 

results, mainly, of the high CO2 emission from the industries and from the combustion of 

fossil combustibles used in vehicles. Having into account this problem, it is important to 

develop strategies in order to decrease CO2 emissions. One was mentioned in the previous 

topic (i.e., the replacement of common fossil combustibles by environmentally friendly H2 

and CH4). Another alternative consists in the preparation of porous structures with high 

affinity to CO2 and to avoid its release for the atmosphere. The United States DOE 

established a program envisaging the retention of 90% of CO2 emissions via the post-

combustion process allowing an increase in the cost of electricity no more than 35% by 

2020.183 

Porous MOF-based materials have been proposed to help in the resolution of this 

sever environmental issue. In the last two decades, MOFs have emerged as a new type of 

functional CO2 adsorbent materials and a rapid progress and extensive development in the 

preparation of these materials with high capacity to sequester CO2 have been 

observed.31,40,44,181 MOF-based material should have some characteristics and requirements 

towards CO2 adsorption: i) to be porous with good accessibility to its channels; ii) 

thermally stable; iii) existence of functional groups (e.g., NH2 moieties) into the pores to 

interact with CO2; iv) insertion of metal ions; and v) the presence of open metal sites.
183 

Alongside these mentioned features, the low production cost of MOFs is another important 

requirement envisaging their industrial availability. The reduction of CO2 emissions

comprises three main separation procedures, such as separation from fuel gas, power plant 

combustion flows and natural gas sources.184 

A huge amount of reports have described the ability of MOFs to retain considerable 

amounts of CO2 into their channels. Among these are included some well-known 

structures, such as NOTT-122 (9.0 mmol g-1),174 HKUST-1 (10.7 mmol g-1),185 MOF-5 

(21.7 mmol g-1),185 MOF-117 (33.5 mmol g-1),185  MIL-100(Cr) (18.0 mmol g-1),186 MIL-

101(Cr) (40.0 mmol g-1),186 NU-100 (46.4 mmol g-1),187 UMCM-1 (23.5 mmol g-1),188 

MOF-200 (54.5 mmol g-1)163 and MOF-210 (54.5 mmol g-1).163

Despite the high affinity of some porous MOF materials toward CO2, the capacity 

of these to separate this gas from a mixture of gases is not, very often, represented or 

investigated. Nevertheless, a considerable number of scientific reports have emerged 

reporting the selective adsorption of CO2 over other gases (i.e., N2, CH4, O2 or CO). Thus, 

this comprises binary (e.g., CO2/CO, CO2/N2 or CO2/CH4) and ternary (CO2/N2/CH4, 

CO2/N2/H2O or CO2N2/O2) gas mixtures.
189-194 In 2008 Wang et al. reported two porous 

zeolite-type imidazolate frameworks, coined as ZIF-95 and ZIF-100, possessing very 

complex cages with 264 vertices, and constructed from about 7524 atoms (Figure 1.26).189 

After breakthrough experiments it was reported that ZIF-95 and ZIF-100 have a great 

ability to selectively adsorb CO2 from mixtures of CO2/CH4, CO2/CO and CO2/N2 (50:50 

v/v). The average selectivities of CO2 over CH4, CO and N2 were of 4.3 : 1, 11.4 : 1 and 

18.0 : 1, respectively, for ZIF-95 and of 5.9 : 1, 17.3 : 1 and 25 : 1, repectively, for ZIF-

100. The research group led by Yaghi employed the known porous Mg-MOF-74 material 

in CO2 separation processes.
44,190 Therefore, after breakthrough experiments where it was 

used a mixture of CH4/CO2 (4:1) it was observed that CO2 is substantially more adsorbed 

than CH4 with a dynamic capacity of 8.9 wt% CO2 uptake (Figure 1.27). It was also 

reported that CO2 can be easily released from the Mg-MOF-74 structure using a significant 

lower temperature at 80 ºC.

 Although some MOF materials have very interesting capacity for the sequestration 

of CO2, enormous efforts have been done to enhance it and, consequently, to improve the 

selective adsorption of CO2 over other gases. A number of strategies have been developed: 

i) insertion of pendant moieties, as for instance, ?NH2 or –OH groups in the organic 

PBUs;195-196 ii) preparation of MOFs with organic ligands derived of nitrogen-containing 

heterocycles;174,197  iii) interpenetration and catenation;198-199 and iv) exposed metal cation 

sites.200

1.3.2. Heterogeneous catalysis 
  

Catalysis is a research area with great and continuous importance aiming at the 

conversion of several chemical species, some of them dangerous to humans and the 

environment, into inoffensive products and in another cases desired molecules for 

applications. Alongside with the quest for porosity, application of multi-dimensional 

MOFs in heterogeneous catalysis has been intensely investigated. Zeolites are the most 

common materials used in industrial heterogeneous catalysis. The preparation of catalytic-

active MOFs does not aim to replace zeolite materials, but, on the contrary, to fill some 

gaps never achieved for this type of materials, as for instance, in enantioselective 

heterogeneous catalysis. 



Chapter 1 

 

30                                                            
 

The recyclability of a heterogeneous catalyst is one of the main objectives of 

researchers working in catalytic processes. Additionally, this can be called as an eco-

friendly procedure (recycle the catalyst without loss of activity). Because several MOFs 

have been shown to be good stable solid materials in many organic solvents, their 

recovering after catalytic essays can be easily performed. For a MOF to have excellent 

catalytic behavior it is absolutely imperative the presence of active catalytically sites from 

the metal or organic molecules (Figure 1.28).22,25 Therefore, the capacity to insert 

functional groups into porous of MOFs and the presence of well-defined channels 

(allowing size and shape selectivity) make these materials excellent candidates for 

heterogeneous catalysis.201 A good MOF catalyst should have: i) functionalized organic 

ligands to display the role, as for instance, Brönsted acids; ii) coordinatively unsaturated 

metal sites; and iii) the potentiality to incorporate metal complexes into the organic ligand 

and pores/channels.32

functionalized bridging organic ligands (b) as catalytic active sites. Reproduced from 
reference 22. 

 

 

How is it possible to prepare organic PBUs which may introduce catalytic behavior 

in MOFs? Some strategies have been reported to achieve this goal, of which the most 

important are: i) immobilization of coordinative unsaturated open metal sites and ii) the 

inclusion of functional organic groups able to improve recognition. The advantage of the 

latter strategy is that, for example, a base-type catalyst can be created because there are 

several organic functional groups which can serve as active base sites.89  

Hasegawa et al. synthesized an organic ligand, termed as (1,3,5-benzene 

tricarboxylic acid tris[N-(4-pyridyl)amide]) (4-btapa), with three amide groups as guest 

interaction sites and three pyridyl groups to coordinate to metallic centers. The self-

assembly of 4-btapa with Cd2+ cations gave rise to a 3D porous network, formulated as

{[Cd(4-btapa)2(NO3)2]·6H2O·2DMF}n. This heterogeneous catalyst was used in the 

Knoevenagel condensation between benzaldehyde with active methylene compounds 

(malononitrile, ethyl cyanoacetate and cyano-acetic acid tert-butyl ester). Obtained data 

demonstrated the selective heterogeneous base catalytic properties of the MOF-based 

compound, which depends on the size of the reactants: the malononitrile was a very good 

substrate, producing 98% conversion of the adduct, while the other substrates reacted 

negligibly (Figure 1.29).

 In 2010 Lin’s group reported the preparation of a family of five isoreticular chiral 

MOFs, termed as CMOFs 1-5, to be employed in the asymmetric epoxidation of a variety 

of unfunctionalyzed alkenes.202 The CMOF materials were prepared from the reaction of 

elongated dicarboxylate chiral Mn-Salen catalytic subunits with Zn(NO3)2·6H2O under 

solvothermal conditions. Catalytic studies involved the use of 1H-indene (as substrate), 

and 2-(tert-butylsulfonyl)iodosylbenzene (as oxidant) in the presence of the catalysts  

CMOFs 1-5 (Scheme 1.1).

 The results suggest that the CMOFs 1-5 exhibit to be highly effective catalysts for 

asymmetric epoxidation of alkenes. The Mn3+ ions, belonging to the dicarboxylate chiral 

Mn-Salen subunits, display a fundamental role in the catalytic process. The catalyst 

CMOF-4 revealed high capacity to afford one of the desired epoxidation products in 90% 

conversion and 92% ee (enantiomeric excess). Additionally, this family of materials 

showed good reusability. 

 Two years ago Gedrich et al. reported the synthesis of two chiral MOFs with wide-

open pores (&gt; 30 Å).203 These materials were prepared from reactive mixtures composed of 

large chiral tripodal carboxylate-based ligands (termed as H3ChirBTB-1 and -2, with 

4,4’,4’’-benzene-1,3,5-triyltribenzoate (BTB) backbones decorated with three chiral 

oxazolidinone substituents) and Zn(NO3)2·4H2O in DEF. The resulting porous MOF 

materials, formulated as [Zn3(ChirBTB-1)2] and [Zn3(ChirBTB-2)2], were used as catalysts 

in Mukaiyama aldol reactions with 1-methoxy-1-(trimethylsilyloxy)-2-methyl-1-propene 

and benzaldehyde or 1-naphthaldehyde (Scheme 1.2). 

 Both porous MOFs showed to be highly active Lewis acid catalysts exhibiting 

considerable enantioselectivity in the Mukaiyama aldol reactions. Table 1.3 lists the results 

obtaining during the catalytic tests.

To enhance the catalytic performance of MOFs, researchers have employed two 

strategies: i) postsynthetic modifications into the porous surface of MOFs; and ii) 

encapsulation of nanoparticles using the porous MOF structure as host matrices to support 

the catalysis.31,204 Therefore, and besides the catalytic reactions exposed above, MOFs 

have been involved in several other catalytic transformations, of which we emphasize:  

- Aerobic oxidation of alcohols;205 

- C-C coupling reactions;206

1.3.3. Luminescence 
  

The luminescence properties of MOFs have attracted the interest of many 

groups.24,33-34,103,211 Luminescence is normally used to describe the process where light is 

produced by the adsorption of energy,34 and contains two basic forms: i) fluorescence 

which is spin-allowed, possessing typical lifetimes in the range from nano- to 

microseconds; and ii) phosphorescence being spin-forbidden and having lifetimes which 

can reach several seconds.24 The luminescent properties comprise the following features:34 

- luminescence spectra containing the fluorescence intensity as a function of a 

wavelength; 



Chapter 1 

 

34                                                            
 

- quantum yield which is traduced as the efficiency of the fluorescence process. This 

parameter is defined as the ratio of the number of emitted photons come from the 

fluorescence process in relation of the photons absorbed; 

- lifetime that is related with the average time in which the molecule stays in its 

excited state before emitting photon. This parameter is determined as being 

inversely proportional to the sum rate constants of radiative and non-radiative 

processes. 

The possibility to simultaneously fine-tune the organic and inorganic components 

allows the modification of the optical properties of the final materials. Light emission may 

appear either from individual organic ligands or metallic centers, or from materials 

resulting from their interconnection. Thus, the luminescent properties of a given MOF may 

arise from: i) organic ligand-based luminescence, including both the phenomena ligand-to-

metal charge transfer (LMCT) and metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT); ii) adsorbate-

based emission and sensitization, the so called antenna effect; iii) surface functionalization; 

and iv) scintillation.24 In Figure 1.30 are depicted the luminescent phenomena observed in 

a MOF-based material. MOFs, possessing permanent porosity, may unveil some 

luminescent features which are not possible to observe in other materials: 

- The capacity of MOF materials to accumulate molecules (as for instance, solvent 

molecules) into their channels, allowing a close proximity between these and the 

luminescent centers, may affect the overall emission properties; 

- The existence of rigidity in a MOF material constrains the organic ligands in some 

way that may lead to an increase of the fluorescence lifetimes and quantum 

efficiency. This feature is not observed for free complexes in solution; 

- Because MOFs exist solely, their surfaces can be functionalized in solid state. This 

leads to new properties with potential for different optical applications.

MOF. The organic linkers are represented as yellow rectangles, the metallic centers as

 Regarding the organic ligands, these have luminescent groups, being normally 

conjugated organic compounds (i.e., naphthalene, pyridine, pyrene, anthracene, 

stilbenzene), which absorb in the UV and visible region and the emission may occurs 

directly from the molecule or involving a charge transfer process with coordinated metal 

ions. The metallic centers, as for instance, transition metals with unpaired electrons may be 

efficient quenchers. However, MOFs constructed from N- or O-donor ligands and d10-

elements, as for instance ZnII or CdII, can exhibit luminescence. Metal-centered 

luminescence is seen in MOFs containing lanthanide ions, Ln(III), as nodes. The proximity 

between an fluorophore organic ligand and a Ln(III) ion can lead to the antenna effect 

(Figure 1.31) increasing the luminescence intensity.32-33

 Luminescent MOFs have been constructed from the self-assembly of distinct 

organic linkers and metallic centers (lanthanides and transition metals). Some have 

potential applications as small-molecules and ions sensors, pH sensors, luminescent labels 

for fluoro-immunoassays, high-technology optics, among others. 24,34,90,211-219 

 In 2011 the research group led by Kitagawa reported a remarkable example of a 

luminescent MOF. This material consists in a porous framework, [Zn2(bdc)2(dpNDI)]n,
90 

prepared from a mixture composed of benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid (H2bdc) and N,N’-

di(4-pyridyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalenediimide (dpNDI) organic linkers and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O in 

DMF, under solvothermal conditions. Even though the new dpNDI linker predictably has a 

low fluorescence quantum yield, the authors deduced that this molecule could strongly 

interact with aromatic volatile organic compounds (VOC). The obtained materials 

exhibited a strong color change in the visible region of the spectrum which was a 

consequence of the adsorbed aromatic VOC. The incorporation of benzene, toluene, 

xylene, anisole and iodobenzene into the porous framework of desolvated

[Zn2(bdc)2(dpNDI)]n, led to new products (i.e., [Zn2(bdc)2(dpNDI)]n &gt; VOC) displaying 

intense blue, cyan, green, yellow, and red photoluminescence, respectively (Figure 1.32). It 

was that this chemoresponse was of a non-linear nature owing the coupling of structural 

transformation with the amount of adsorbed gest molecules.

 Taking advantage of the luminescence emitted by lanthanide ions, Li et al.214 

reported the preparation of a new luminescent lanthanide-based MOF exhibiting efficient 

turn-on generated by solvent vapor with excellent selectivity for DMF. The basis for this

due to both skin contact and inhalation in several industries responsible for the production 

of synthetic fibers, coatings, films and leather tanning. Studies show that the contact with 

DMF may be related with hepatoxicity and carcinogenesis issues. Thus, a reactive mixture 

containing Eu(NO3)3 and the 2’,5’-bis(methoxymethyl)-[1,1’:4’,1’’-terphenyl]-4,4’’-

dicarboxylic acid (H2L) in DMF/H2O (4:1 v/v) at 80 ºC for 3 days was prepared. The new 

luminescent MOF was formulated as [Eu2(L)3(H2O)4]·3DMF (Figure 1.33a). In order to 

replace the DMF guest molecules by H2O, [Eu2(L)3(H2O)4]·3DMF was immersed in 

distillated water for three days giving rise to a water-exchanged MOF. The sensing ability 

of the new water-exchanged material was investigated for several solvents (e.g., acetone, 

benzene, dichloromethane, DMF, ethanol, hexane, THF, among others). After incubation 

of the material for 24 h under a range of solvent vapors, the luminescent response of the 

water-exchanged MOF was measured. Results suggested that the MOF material displays a 

superior turn-on after DMF vapor exposure, being the luminescence enhanced more than 

eight times Figure (1.33b).

1.4. Phosphonate-Based MOFs 

 

The choice of organic linkers for the preparation of multidimensional MOFs is an 

important step and, undoubtedly, an enormous challenge. Organic PBUs may be obtained 

from the various commercially available sources or designed and prepared by each 

research group. In this section it will be presented examples of phosphonate-based organic 

linkers of both types. Particularly attention will be given to those designed and synthesized 

by the research groups for the preparation of functional and multidimensional MOFs.  

In Figure 1.34 are represented some examples of commercially available organic 

ligands (multipodal aromatic, aliphatic, rigid or flexible phosphonate-based molecules) that 

have been used in the preparation of multidimensional MOFs.

1.4.1. Properties and Potential Applications 
 

Interest in metal-organophosphate chemistry began in the 1960s and 1970s with the 

discovery of crystalline zirconium phosphates and layered organophosphates.220-221 

Clearfield and collaborators have, undoubtedly, done a remarkable work in this field, both 

in the development of several phosphonate-based materials as in the publication of 

comprehensive reviews, which are useful tools to understand metal phosphonates 

chemistry.35,220,222-227 

Compared with carboxylates or N-donor ligands, phosphonates are less used for the 

construction of MOFs.228 This may be due to some factors: i) poor solubility of some 

phosphonate ligands; ii) the pre-disposition to form simple phosphonate structures as dense 

layered materials, which makes the formation of high surface area materials a difficult 

task; iii) the growth of single crystals with phosphonates is more complicated because they 

often precipitate rapidly giving rise to less ordered materials; and iv) when compared with 

other more studied coordinating groups, such as carboxylate and pyridyl, the final 

architectures are less predictable because phosphonates have more possible coordination 

modes and two stages of deprotonation .26,229 Nevertheless, some of these issues may be 

solved: i) including some polar functional groups (as for instance, crown ether, amino, 

carboxylate or hydroxyl) into the phosphonate compound or ii) introducing a second 

organic molecule (co-ligand) with different functional groups in order to improve the 

solubility, crystallinity and the formation of 3D highly porous and robust phosphonate 

materials with open frameworks.228,230-232 Additionally, the C-PO3 bond is also stable to 

high temperatures.233 



Metal-Organic Frameworks   

 

                                                           39 
 

In the literature, it is possible to see that phosphonate-based MOFs contain, 

essentially, transition metals and lanthanides in their structures.231,234-236 The self-assembly 

of MOFs combining phosphonates with lanthanides seems to be a good choice, because the 

large number of O-donor atoms present in the organic linker fills the requirement of 

lanthanides which can exhibit high coordination number. This fact may lead to the 

formation of unusual and different architectures to those of the transition metals. In 

addition, the photoluminescent properties of lanthanides make them highly attractive for 

the synthesis of functional MOFs.232,237 

The preparation of phosphonate-based MOFs requires the adjustment of many 

synthetic variables: phosphonate and metal source, solvent, metal:P molar ratio, 

concentration, pH, and, very important, reaction time and temperature. Therefore, the 

variation of these reaction parameters displays a very relevant role in the final structure of 

MOFs.229 

Due to the properties of the multifunctional phosphonate-based MOFs, these 

materials have potentiality to be applied in distinct fields, such as gas storage and 

separation, ion exchange, heterogeneous catalysis and as optical sensors.  

 

1.4.2. Examples of Functional MOFs Prepared from Phosphonate-Based 

Organic Ligands 
 

In section 1.3 it was described some properties and potential applications of 

multidimensional MOFs prepared from carboxylates and N-donor organic ligands. 

Nevertheless, any example of phosphonate-based MOFs was not mentioned. The research 

group in which I was working has dedicated enormous efforts in the preparation of 

functional MOFs containing phosphonate organic ligands and lanthanide ions. In the last 

years I have been interested in the preparation of MOFs using lanthanides as metallic 

centers and phosphonate organic linkers. These molecules were thought in order to 

envisage the final structure (1D, 2D, 3D, dense or porous) and properties (i.e., catalytic 

behavior, photoluminescence and adsorption) of the resulting MOF materials. 

In this subsection, several examples of designed and prepared, by worldwide 

research groups, phosphonate-based molecules will be listed as well as the corresponding 

MOFs. Additionally, the synthesis of few examples of organic linkers, phosphonate-based-

MOFs and their properties will be described in more detail. Table 1.3 lists several 

examples of phosphonate-based organic linkers as well as the MOFs prepared using these 

molecules and their properties.

Plabst and Bein developed an interesting organic PBU, 1,4-phenylenebis(methane)-

tetraposphonic acid (H8L18) (Scheme 1.3), used to design new multi-dimensional MOFs 

with lanthanide centers.237 H8L18 contains two bisphosphonate groups which are capable 

to coordinate to metallic centers through different coordination fashions. The procedure to 

prepare the materials was based in a mixture of H8L18 and Ln(NO3)3·6H2O salts under 

hydrothermal conditions. The metal:ligand molar ratios in the synthesis solution were 

selected as 1:1, 2:1, 4:1 and 6:1. The pH was adjusted with NaOH in a range from pH=1 to 

pH=7-8. The reaction mixtures were kept for 7 days at 75, 100, 150, or 180 ºC giving rise 

to three structures types with general formula [Ln(H5L18)]·4H2O [Ln2(H2L18)]·8H2O and 

[NaLn(H4L18)]·4H2O (where Ln
3+ = La3+, Nd3+, Gd3+ and Dy3+).

[NaLn(H4L18)]·4H2O (Figure 1.35) contains Na
+ and water molecules as guests in 

the channels. This MOF was used as the subject of study to evaluate the exchange of Na+ 

with other monovalent cations (Li+, K+, Rb+ and Cs+), divalent cations (Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, 

Ba2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+ and Mn2+) and the trivalent Fe3+.255 Results suggested that Na+ can 

be exchanged with monovalent cations, while the divalent and trivalent ones were rejected. 

This type of behavior is rare in open-framework ion-exchanging materials because it is 

normally related to size instead of charge. Therefore, [NaLn(H4L18)]·4H2O  appears to be 

an excellent candidate for the design of selective ion-exchange materials.

N,N?-Piperazinebis(methylenephosphonic acid) (H4L3) organic ligand (Scheme 

1.4) is particularly interesting due to its flexibility. This molecule is able to generate 

structures in which the coordination of the ligand to the metal is made via two or three 

oxygen atoms of the phosphonate groups and also via the nitrogen atoms of the piperazine 

ring.233,241,259-260

Miller et al. isolate a highly symmetrical and porous framework, [Ni2(L3)]·xH2O 

(with x = 8, 2 or 0), also coined as Ni-STA12 (Figure 1.36) from the self-assembly of 

H4L3 with Ni
2+ cations.233  

 Studies of H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 adsorption were performed and monitored through 

infrared spectroscopy to identify the sites responsible for the capture of these molecules. It 

was found that the evacuated Ni-STA12 material has an uptake of CO2 ten times more than 

of CH4. This occurs due to the strong interactions of CO2 with all coordinative unsaturated 

Ni2+ sites. A similar conclusion was found for the H2 and CO, in other words, this species 

can interact with Ni2+ cations (weak Lewis acid sites). There is no information about the 

interactions between H2 and P=O moiety.

In 2011, Zhu et al. designed and synthesized a new flexible phosphonate-based 

organic ligand: N-benzyliminobis(methylene-phosphonic acid) (H4L22) (Scheme 1.5). 

After preparing a reaction mixture containing H4L22, oxalic acid (as co-ligand) and the 

respective LnCl3·6H2O salts (where Ln
3+ = La3+-Dy3+, Er3+ and Y3+) in distillated water, it 

was isolated a family of isotypical lanthanide-based 2D, formulated as 

[Ln(H3L22)(C2O4)]·2H2O (Ln
3+ = La3+-Dy3+, Er3+ and Y3+) layered structures (Figure 

1.37).258 

 

 
Scheme 1.5 - Synthesis of N-benzylaminobis(methylenephosphonic acid) (H4L22). 

 

Oxalate was chosen due to two main reasons: i) the presence of high and versatile 

coordination modes to coordinate with lanthanides (having high coordination number) and, 

mainly, ii) ?-conjugated character which make it an effective bridge for charger transfer 

between lanthanide metallic centers, rendering it very helpful as a lanthanide luminescent 

sensitizer. Photoluminescence of Sm3+-, Eu3+-, Tb3+- and Dy3+-based materials were 

measured. A comparative study between hydrated and dehydrated Eu-based compounds 

was performed. As expected, the hydrated sample emits less than the dehydrated one. This 

is due to the quenching effect from O-H groups of the water molecules. Studies also 

revealed a lower emission intensity for the Sm3+-based material when compared with 

compounds having Eu3+, Tb3+ and Dy3+ cations in their structure. This mean that there is 

lower efficiency of energy-transfer from organic molecules to metallic centers in 

[Sm(H3L22)(C2O4)]·2H2O.

Several reports describing the catalytic behavior of phosphonate-based MOFs, 

mainly with transition metals, have been published. After a slow evaporation of a mixture 

composed of the chiral 2,2’-diethoxy-1,1’-binaphthalene-6,6’-diphosphonic acid (H4L19) 

(Scheme 1.6) and nitrate or perchlorate Ln3+ salts in MeOH/HCl, Evans et al. isolated

structure stability and reversibility of the dehydration process of these materials allowed 

the authors to explore their applications in heterogeneous catalysis. Because the presence 

of both Lewis and Brönsted acid sites in the materials, these could be adequate to catalyze 

various organic transformations such as the cyanosilylation of aldehydes and ring opening 

of meso-carboxylic anhydrides (1-naphthaldehyde and propionaldehyde were converted to 

their cyanohydrin products with &gt;50% yield) and cyanosilylation of aldehydes (conversion

1.5. Outline and Main Objectives of this PhD Thesis 

 

The scope of this PhD project is based on the preparation of functional and 

multidimentional MOFs from the self-assembly of rare-earths as metallic centers with 

phosphonate-based organic ligands, selected and prepared by myself. Therefore, for the 

first task of this work it is proposed the synthesis of four different organic ligands (Figure 

1.39): 

i) 1,4-phenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid (H4pmd): to expand the family of 

Lanthanide-Organic Frameworks (composed by the compounds [Ce(Hpmd)(H2O)] 

and [Pr(Hpmd)(H2O)])
261 initialized by the research group where I was working. 

The incorporation of other lanthanide cations as, for instance the optically-active 

Eu3+ and Tb3+, can lead to the formation of functional MOFs with luminescent 

properties; 

ii) (benzene-1,3,5-triyltris-(methylene))triphosphonic acid (H6bmt): to self-assembly 

with the series of lanthanides, by using distinct synthetic approaches, to isolate 

novel multidimentional MOFs with catalytic behavior and photoluminescent 

properties; 

iii) ((2,4,6-trifluorobenzene-1,3,5-triyl)tris(methylene))triphosphonic acid (H6tftp): 

analogue of the H6bmt organic linker. To prepare MOF materials with the same 

crystalline phase of those isolate by employing H6bmt. To assess the influence of 

the replacement of C-H by C-F moieties in the photoluminescent properties of the 

resulting materials; 

iv) a large tripodal organic linker, termed as H6L: to coordinate with rare-earth cations 

in order to isolate highly porous MOFs with adsorption and catalytic properties. 

Based on the literature and in previous works, it is aimed to prepare all the organic 

molecules using specific synthetic routes, as for instance, Michaelis-Arbusov and catalytic 

cross-coupling reactions to prepare the intermediate phosphoethyl esters and acid 

hydrolysis to isolate the desired phosphonic acid organic ligand. The synthesis of all 

compounds will be carried out using conventional heating organic methods and, always 

possible, microwave-assisted synthesis. The evolution of all reactions will be performed by 

thin layer chromatography (TLC) and the purification of the intermediates and final 

compounds will be carried out by flash column chromatography and, if needed, employing 

crystallization processes using adequate organic solvents. 

All organic compounds will be fully characterized by standard liquid-state 

techniques (NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry) and single-crystal X-ray 

diffraction.

The synthesis of the MOF materials will be based on the use of distinct synthetic 

methodologies: i) hydro(solvo)thermal synthesis; ii) microwave- and ultrasound-assisted 

synthesis; and iii) a bench method called “one-pot” synthesis. To prepare functional MOFs 

as phase-pure and with large crystal sizes to be studied by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, 

it will be necessary to optimize the various reaction parameters (i.e., reaction temperature 

and time, pH of the reaction solutions, solvents or mixtures of solvents, irradiation power 

and pressure, for the case of the microwave-assisted synthesis, among others). Materials 

will be characterized by using several standard solid-state techniques (powder or single-

crystal X-ray diffraction, vibrational spectroscopy (FT-IR and FT-Raman), electron 

microscopy (SEM and EDS), solid-state NMR, thermogravimetric and elemental analyses) 

to investigate the crystalline structure. 

Investigations on the intrinsic properties of the resulting MOF materials (i.e., 

photoluminescence, catalytic behavior and gas adsorption) only may possible with the 

close collaboration with some researchers and group leaders expert in these scientific 

fields. Thus, the photoluminescent properties of the optically-active MOFs will be 

performed by Dr. Duarte Ananias and the catalytic behavior of the materials will be 

investigated in the Dr. Anabela Valente’s research group, both Auxiliary Researchers of 

the Associated Laboratory CICECO (Department of Chemistry of the University of 

Aveiro). Regarding to the gas adsorption properties of the porous Y3+-based MOF, these 

will be investigated in collaboration with the research group led by Prof. Dr. Jorge Navarro 

at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Granada (Spain). 

Therefore, because it is supposed to isolate functional MOFs, we propose the study 

of their: 

i) photoluminescent properties (i.e., for the materials containing optically-active 

lanthanide metallic centers);

ii) heterogeneous catalytic behavior, because the MOF materials are, normally, stable 

powdered compounds in several organic solvents. It is proposed to evaluate the 

catalytic activity of the resulting MOFs in the ring-opening reaction of styrene 

oxide with methanol; 

iii)adsorption properties, mainly, for the MOFs construct from the large tripodal H6L 

organic ligand: to investigate their abilities, as for instance, for selective gas 

separation processes using binary (e.g., C3H6/ C3H8 and CO2/C2H2) and ternary 

(e.g., CO2/C2H2/CH4 and CO2/C2H2/N2) gas mixtures.

2.1. Introduction 

 

Organophosphorus compounds are a family of organic molecules possessing 

carbon-phosphorus (C?P) bonds. The first organophosphorus molecules emerged for the 

first time in the middle ages. This family of compounds was in 1820 systematically studied 

by Lassaigne while performing the phosphoric acid esterification. Several years later, 

Thinard’s group isolates a series of phosphine derivatives and after this work the progress 

in the phosphorous-based organic molecules was very fast. Therefore, in the middle of the 

XIX century, this field of research was dominated by A. Michaelis, being then continued 

by A. E. Arbusov and his son B. A. Arbusov. The latter, in collaboration with some British 

and German researchers, continued the evolution of this area. Some properties of this type 

of organophosphorus compounds, as for instance, toxicity and the possibility to be used as 

insecticides were discovered in 1930 by Shrader and co-workers, being, then, industrially 

produced. Later, in 1949, the chemistry of the organophosphorus compounds was studied 

by G. M. Kosolapoff. Coffey reviewed recently this type of chemistry.

2.1.1. Structure, Properties and Applications of Phosphonic Acids and 

Ester Derivatives 

  

Phosphonic acid compounds have been described as phosphoric acid derivatives. 

The difference resides in the replacement of a hydroxyl group by an organic substituent (R 

= aryl or alkyl), with RPO3H2 as general formula: the phosphorous atom, in this case, is 

pentavalent connected to three atoms (two oxygens and one R) by simple bonds and to one 

oxygen by one double bond. Additionally, the phosphorous of phosphonic acids has sp
3
 

hybridization conferring it a close tetrahedral geometry.
4-5

 In Figure 2.1 it is represented 

the molecular formula of the phosphonic acid (as well as its geometry), phosphonate 

(deprotonated form of the phosphonic acid) and the ester of the phosphonic acid. 

Regarding to the acidic properties of the phosphonic acids, acidity of the first proton can 

vary in a pKa1 range between 0.5 and approximately 3, while for the second proton the pKa2 

value is comprised in the 5-9 range. This variation in the pKa1 and pKa2 values may be 

based on the presence of some electron-donating (EDG) or/and electron-withdrawing 

(EWG) groups.
4
 

 Due to their properties, phosphonic acids have found applications in distinct areas 

such as: organic synthesis reactants, antioxidants of industrial oils, production of non-

flammable plastics, surface applications to prevent corrosion processes, as agrochemicals 

(i.e., insecticides, herbicides and fungicides) and for medical purposes (antitumor, anti-

hepatitis B and -HIV virus and in clinical dentistry).

 In Figure 2.2 are depicted some of 

the commercially available phosphonate-based and phosphonic acid compounds which 

have been employed in different fields: i) phosphonoformic acid (Foscavir

) an antiviral 

agent; ii) the herbicide N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine (Roundup

); iii) 3-amino-1-

geometry, phosphonate and ester of phosphonic acid. 

 

 

Phosphonic acid-based organic molecules have been employed in the synthesis of 

metal phosphonate-based compounds. Alberti and collaborators reported in 1978 for the 

first time this type of compounds consisting in zirconium phosphonate layered structures 

formulated as [Zr(HOCH2PO3)2]·H2O, [Zr(C2H6PO3)] and [Zr(C6H6PO3)].
9
 Since then, the 

interest in the preparation of metal phosphonate chemistry have been substantially 

increased.
10

 The physical and chemical properties of organophosphorus compounds, 

especially phosphonate-based or phosphonic acid organic molecules, led us to employ 

enormous efforts in their preparation for the construction of multidimensional Metal-

Organic Frameworks (MOFs).

2.1.2. Synthetic Methods to Prepare Phosphonic Acid Linkers and their 

Phosphonate Intermediates 

  

In an historical prespective, and as mentioned above, we must go back to the XIX 

century, more precisely in 1897, date on which Michaelis and Becker reported the 

generation of a carbon-phosphorous (C?P) bond, involving the phosphorylation, by using 

salts of dialkylphosphites, of a saturated carbon under heating.
11-13

 Since then, this type of 

nucleophilic phosphorylation has been used and improved in order to prepare new 

phosphonate-based organic ligands in high yields. Therefore, in the literature it is 

commonly found several synthetic methodologies in order to isolate phosphonated 

compounds, such as: i) Michaelis-Arbusov reaction; ii) Michaelis-Becker reaction; iii) 

Mannich-type condensation; and iv) catalytic cross-coupling reaction (nickel or 

palladium). In the next sub-sections, it is only highlighted and described the Michaelis-

Arbusov reaction and the catalytic cross-coupling method, using palladium as catalyst. It is 

also describe the transformation of the dialkyl phosphonate intermediates into organic 

phosphonic acids. 

 

Michaelis-Arbusov Reaction 

 This type of reaction has been reported in several articles and reviews since 1949, 

being used very often in the synthesis of new phosphonate-based organic compounds .
14-19

 

The Michaelis-Arbusov reaction is one of the most versatile synthetic routes to produce 

C?P bonds, involving the reaction of an primary alkyl halide, possessing commonly Cl, Br 

or I elements, with trialkyl phosphite, with the formula P(OR)3 [where R = ?CH3, 

?CH2CH3, ?CH(CH3)2, and others]. This reaction is normally performed at 110-200 ºC, 

depending of the R group and used solvents as, for instance, toluene or xylene,
17-18,20

 being 

more common its use without organic solvents. Normally, the trialkyl phosphite has been 

used as reagent and solvent.  

 

Scheme 2.1 – Schematic representation of the mechanism of the Michaelis-Arbusov 

reaction. 



Chapter 2 

68                                                            

 

Mechanistically, the Michaelis-Arbusov reaction comprises two reaction steps 

(Scheme 2.1). First, a nucleophilic attack (SN2) of the trialkyl phosphite, promoted by the 

free electron pair present in the phosphorus atom, to the ?-carbon of the alkyl halide. This 

phenomenon leads to the formation of an ionic phosphonium salt intermediate and a halide 

anion. Then, because the phosphonium intermediate is unstable under heat, the halide 

anion, being the leaving group in the first reaction step and acting as a nucleophile in the 

second one, attacks one carbon that is directly connected to oxygen of one of the alkoxy 

groups (in a SN2 reaction) affording the phosphonate ester. In summary, during this 

transformation the trivalent phosphorus is converted in a pentavalent one.
4,12,21

 

 

Catalytic Cross-coupling Reaction 

 The general main objective of a transition metal-catalyzed organic synthesis 

comprises the formation of a carbon-carbon (C?C) bond. The Pd-catalyzed coupling 

reaction is one of the most employed and efficient methodologies regarding the 

construction of C?C bonds. In addition to Pd-catalysts (e.g., Pd(OAc)2 and [Pd(PPh3)4]), 

transition metal-catalysts (as for instance, NiBr2 and NiCl2) have also been extensively 

used for the formation of carbon-phosphorus (C?P) and carbon-boron (C?B) bonds in 

order to produce respective aryl or alkenyl phosphonate or boronic acid organic 

molecules.
22-25

 

 

 

Scheme 2.2 – Schematic representation of the mechanism of palladium-catalyzed 

cross-coupling. 



Bi- and Tripodal Phosphonate Organic Ligands 

                                                        69 

 

Contrary to what happens in the Michaelis-Arbusov approach, involving the use of 

primary alkyl halide, the reaction between alkenyl or aryl halides with trialkyl phosphite 

does not occur because the halide is an electrophilic poor molecule. The use of a transition 

metal-catalyst is required. 

 Catalytic cross-coupling reaction is complicated involving three main steps: i) 

oxidative addition; ii) transmetalation; and iii) reductive elimination (Scheme 2.2). In 

addition, electronic and steric features of the organic halides, the palladium source as well 

as the anionic additives and ligands display a very important role in the success of the 

formation of the C?P bond. Therefore, mechanistically the catalytic cross-coupling 

reaction starts with the formation of an active Pd
0
 complex. Then, it arises a palladium 

complex due to the oxidative addition of an aryl or alkenyl substrate. Pd becomes Pd
II
. In 

the next step, the trialkyl phosphite coordinates to the metal center giving rise to a new 

palladium complex (ligand?phosphite?Pd
II
-aryl (or alkenyl) complex) and to the 

consequent formation of a Pd?P bond. Finally, in the last step a reductive elimination 

occurred, being the Pd
0
 regenerated and the C?P bond formed in order to isolate the 

desired organic phosphonic ligand.
4,12

 

 

From Phosphonate Intermediates to the Final Acid Phosphonic Organic Compounds 

The transformation of the dialkyl phosphonates into the respective phosphonic acid 

compounds is a relatively simple step. This methodology comprises a conventional acid 

hydrolysis from the preparation of a reaction mixture containing the dialkyl phosphonate 

intermediate with an aqueous solution of HCl (6 M) or even concentrated HCl (Scheme 

2.3). The solution is refluxed during few to several hours depending of the number of 

existing phosphonate groups and/or the complexity of the organic molecule.

This chapter only focus the synthesis of four phosphonic organic ligands: i) the 

dipodal 1,4-phenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid (H4pmd); ii) the tripodal 

(benzene-1,3,5-triyltris(methylene))tri-phosphonic acid (H6bmt); iii) the fluorinated 

tripodal ((2,4,6-trifluorobenzene-1,3,5-triyl)tris(methylene))-triphosphonic acid (H6tftp); 

and iv) the large tripodal H6L (depicted in Figure 1.39 of the Chapter 1). All synthetic 

routes, purification processes and characterization (NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry 

and single-crystal X-ray diffraction) are described in detail.

2.2. Strategy 
 

Our research group initialized the quest for MOF materials composed of highly 

flexible and aliphatic carboxylate organic molecules obtained commercially. Nevertheless, 

and progressing in time, the carboxylate groups have been replaced by phosphonate ones 

(Figure 2.3).
28-37

  

 

 

Figure 2.3 – Highly flexible and aliphatic carboxylate and/or phosphonate organic 

ligands used for our research group to prepare MOFs. 

 

 

From these previous investigations it was possible to draw some conclusions: 

(i) the presence of central nitrogen atom core together with methylene groups, 

despite being a suitable moiety to employ in divergent tripodal organic PBUs, 

promotes a high degree of flexibility of the organic molecule and consequently 

supramolecular isomerism. This fact, may be related with the preparation of 

microcrystalline MOF powders;  

(ii) two-dimensional MOF materials are usually isolated because the organic PBUs 

act as chelating agents of the metal cations and branching is only facilitated in two 

directions of the space;  

(iii) because many of these previously reported structures contain f-block elements, 

we observed that the absence of suitable sensitizers in the organic PBUs (e.g., 

aromatic rings) led to poor photoluminescent properties. To boost emission of the 

isolated Lanthanide–Organic Frameworks (LnOFs) specific groups have to be 

included, such as aromatic rings, so as to promote an effective antenna effect;  



Bi- and Tripodal Phosphonate Organic Ligands 

                                                        71 

 

(iv) in addition, the central nitrogen atom appears protonated in the synthesized 

MOF structures (as also occurs in the zwitterionic forms of the starting organic 

PBUs), which constitutes an additional quencher (non-radiative) of the 

photoluminescent properties. 

Comparing carboxylic with phosphonic acids ligands, the latter are more acidic, the 

number of electrons is twice higher and they are non-planar possessing tetrahedral 

geometry. This set of characteristics allows the formation of stronger hydrogen bonds, 

being a very good request for the design of crystalline structures and for the self-assembly 

of supramolecular arrays.
10

 

Keeping into account all these information, we have done enormous efforts towards 

the preparation of di- and tripodal aromatic phosphonate-based molecules. With that we 

prospect the construction of multidimensional MOF materials aiming the improvement of 

their final properties (e.g., photoluminescence).  

 

 

2.3. 1,4-Phenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid (H4pmd) 

 

2.3.1. Synthesis 

 

1,4-Phenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid (H4pmd) linker was for the first 

time used by our group for the preparation of LnOFs. In 2008 it was reported the synthesis 

of two layered LnOFs, formulated as [Ln(Hpmd)(H2O)] (Ln
3+

 = Ce
3+

 and Pr
3+

) based on 

H4pmd.
38

 In that work, H4pmd was generated in situ, involving the use of ionic liquids 

from his tetraethyl ester derivative 1,4-phenylenebis(methylene)bisphosphonate 

(commercially available). Although being novel, the method proved to be difficult and the 

extension for other lanthanides it was not possible to perform. 

The H4pmd organic linker was herein isolated using a different synthetic route. An 

aqueous suspension composed of HCl (6M) with the commercially available tetraethyl 1,4-

phenylenebis(methylene)-bisphosphonate was prepared and refluxed for 20 h (Scheme 

2.4). The solvent was completely distilled and the desired linker, 1,4-

phenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid (H4pmd), was obtained as crystalline white 

powder with 96% yield (see the Experimental Section for further details).

2.3.2. Structural Elucidation  

  

To confirm the structure of the 1,4-phenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid 

(H4pmd) organic molecule it was collected the respective 
1
H,

C and

P NMR spectra 

using DMSO-d6 as solvent. Analyzing the 
1
H spectrum, it is observed one doublet 

(J(

H?

31
P) = 19.9 Hz) at ? 2.91 ppm corresponding to the resonance of the protons of the 

methylene (–CH2) group with the phosphorous belonging to the –PO3H2 groups. In the 

aromatic zone appears one singlet at 7.15 ppm corresponding to the aromatic protons. In 

the 
13

C NMR spectrum at ? 35.0 ppm it is observed a doublet (J(
13

C?
31

P) = 132.6 Hz) 

which is related with the resonance of the carbons belonging to the –CH2 groups with 

phosphorous. At ? 129.4 and 131.8 ppm are presented the aromatic –CH and the aromatic 

–C–CH2, respectively. The 
31

P NMR spectrum only has one triplet (J(
31

P?
1
H) = 22.2 Hz) 

centered at ? 21.7 ppm resulting to the coupling between the phosphorous with the protons 

of the methylene moiety.  

 

 

2.4. (Benzene-1,3,5-triyltris(methylene))triphosphonic acid (H6bmt) 

 

2.4.1. Synthesis 

 

The synthesis and structural characterization of the tripodal (benzene-1,3,5-triyltris-

(methylene))triphosphonic acid (H6bmt), as well as its phosphohexaethyl ester derivative, 

has been previously reported in several works.
4,6-8,26,39-41

 Its use has been focused for the 

preparation of mesostructured organosilica hybrids, to assembly to fullerene (C60), as 

organic unities for the synthesis of dendrimers and, only once, for the synthesis of a MOF 

material. 

 

Michaelis-Arbusov reaction 

Based on the literature, our first attempts were based on the preparation of some 

reaction mixtures composed of the commercially available 1,3,5-tris(bromomethyl)-

benzene and triethyl phosphite in dry toluene or xylene. The solutions were refluxed, under 

constant magnetic stirring, during large periods of time (ranging from 18 h to 3 days). 

Although we isolated the desired organic molecule (IL
1
, see scheme 2.5), reactions were 

very slow and IL
1
 was obtained in low yields. 

The synthetic procedure was modified to a Michaelis–Arbusov reaction: mixture 

composed of 1,3,5-tris-(bromomethyl)benzene
42

 with triethyl phosphite (acting as reactant 

and solvent).
26,41

 The reaction occurred at 120 ºC during 12 h (see Experimental Section 

for further details). Upon completion of the reaction, the excess of triethyl phosphite was 

removed by distillation under reduced pressure (Caution! triethyl phosphite has an 

extremely unpleasant smell and it is harmful; it should be, therefore, always handled inside 

a fume hood). The intermediate compound IL

Acid hydrolysis 

The second step, in order to isolate H6bmt, was based on an acid hydrolysis 

reaction: IL

 was treated with an aqueous solution of HCl for 20 h at reflux. The resulting 

solution was washed with dichloromethane and H6bmt was immediately isolated as a white 

crystalline solid, being washed with acetone. H6bmt was obtained in 92% yield.

acid (H6tftp) 

 

2.5.1. Synthesis 

 

The tripodal organic linker ((2,4,6-trifluorobenzene-1,3,5-triyl)tris(methylene))tri-

phosphonic acid (H6tftp, Scheme 2.6) was, to the best of our knowledge, firstly prepared 

by our research group. Its synthesis involves three step reactions: i) chloromethylation; ii) 

Michaelis-Arbusov; and iii) acid hydrolysis. 

 

 

Scheme 2.6 - Synthetic route of ((2,4,6-trifluorobenzene-1,3,5-triyl)tris-

(methylene))triphosphonic acid (H6tftp).  

 

 

Chloromethylation 

The preparation of the intermediate compound 1,3,5-tris(chloromethyl)-2,4,6-

trifluorobenzene (IL
2
) was, the most challenging reaction step in order to prepare H6tftp. 

The synthesis of IL
2
 was attempted by preparing an reaction mixture composed of 1,3,5-

trifluorobenzene, chloromethyl methyl ether (3.2, 4 or 6 eq.), carbon disulfide (CS2) or 

dichloromethane (as solvent) in the presence of anhydrous aluminium chloride (AlCl3; 1, 4 

or 6 eq.). Reactions were performed at different temperatures (ambient or refluxing) 

varying the period of time (from 5 to 18 h), because the conversion of the starting material 

occurred very slowly. The reactions were quenched using a mixture of water/ice, and 

NaHCO3 was added to neutralize the resulting mixture. The organic products were 

extracted with dichloromethane and the desired IL
2 

intermediate was purified by flash 

column chromatography using petroleum ether / dichloromethane (4:1) as eluent. The 

desired organic molecule IL
2 

was obtained in very low yields (10 – 20%).

Aiming at the production of IL
2
 in large amounts, to some modifications in the 

synthetic protocol described above were made. A mixture of 1,3,5-trifluorobenzene and 

chloromethyl methyl ether (18 eq.) in the presence of 18 eq. of anhydrous AlCl3 (slowly 

added to the reaction at 0 ºC during approximately 10 min and, consequent, formation of 

an orange precipitate) was prepared in a two neck round-bottom flask, under nitrogen 

pressure (see Figure 2.5). The temperature was increased for 40 ºC and the reaction 

occurred for approximately 7 h (see Experimental Section for further details). After that, 

the resulting mixture, having the desired compound as well as some secondary products, 

was quenched with a mixture of water/ice and neutralized with NaHCO3. The organic 

products were recovered after extraction with dichloromethane and purified by flash 

column chromatography using petroleum ether/dichloromethane (4:1) as eluent. The 

intermediate IL
2 

was isolated in 71% yield.

Michaelis-Arbusov reaction 

To isolate IL
3
 a Michaelis-Arbusov reaction was employed by refluxing a mixture 

of IL
2
 and triethyl phosphite for approximately 3 h. The excess of triethyl phosphite was 

distilled under reduced pressure and IL
3
, [hexaethyl((2,4,6-trifluorobenzene-1,3,5-

triyl)tris(methylene))tris(phosphonate)], was isolated as a white powder in 75% yield after 

being purified by flash column chromatography.

Acid hydrolysis 

The last step consisted in an acid hydrolysis where an aqueous solution of HCl (6 

M) was added to IL
3
 and the reaction mixture refluxed for 20 h. The target compound 

H6tftp was isolated as a white crystalline powder in quantitative yields (ca. 98%).  

 

2.5.2. Structural Elucidation 

  

The organic linker ((2,4,6-trifluorobenzene-1,3,5-triyl)tris(methylene))tri-

) and hexaethyl((2,4,6-trifluorobenzene-1,3,5-triyl)tris-

(methylene))tris(phosphonate) (IL
3
) were obtained as crystalline compounds, allowing us 

to solve their crystal structure by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (Figures 2.6 - 2.8). All 

compounds were also characterized by NMR spectroscopy, being dissolve in CDCl3 (IL

and IL
3
) and DMSO-d6 (H6tftp), and mass spectrometry.

The

 has just one signal at ? 4.64 ppm as a singlet, being 

attributed to the resonance of six protons of the methylene groups. Slightly more 

complicated is the

C NMR spectrum which has a multiplet between ? 31.8 and 31.9 ppm 

corresponding to the carbons of the methylene groups. The aromatic carbons of ?C?CH2 

appear at ? 111.0-111.5 ppm range and, finally, the aromatic carbons ?C?F present their 

resonances at ? 159.5 ppm as a double triplet (J(

105.3 ppm. At ? 156.3, 156.4 and 159.7 appears the resonances of the aromatic carbons 

?C?F. In the

ring. The TOF MS ES

 From the

zone a signal as a doublet (J(

carbon –CH2–P. In the aromatic region the carbons of –C–CH2–P (? 105.8-106.2 ppm) and 

of ?C?F (between ? 155.5 and 155.8, and between ? 158.9 and159.1) appear. In the

2.6.1. Synthesis 

  

Aiming at the preparation of three-dimensional robust and highly porous MOFs, a 

large tripodal H6L phosphonate-based organic linker was prepared (Scheme 2.7). The 

presence of four aromatic rings is expected to originate more efficient photoluminescent 

materials owing to the promotion of an effective antenna effect. Additionally, highly 

porous MOFs should be isolated.

 The synthesis of H6L has been previously reported for some research groups who 

used slight different methodologies and different reaction conditions.
24-25,43

 The most 

complex step is, undoubtedly, the isolation of its hexaalkyl ester intermediate. This step 

involves a Michaelis-Arbusov reaction catalyzed by NiCl2, NiBr2 or [Pd(PPh3)4] taking 

from 1 to 6 days to be completed and, normally, high temperatures are required. 

Nevertheless, the intermediate compound of H6L is isolated in high yields (80-90%). The 

second, and final, step towards the isolation of H6L is based on an acid hydrolysis, 



Bi- and Tripodal Phosphonate Organic Ligands

refluxing an aqueous solution of concentrated HCl during some hours. The desired 

compound is obtained from very high to quantitative yields. 

 

Pd-catalyzed Cross-coupling reaction  

 Commercially available 1,3,5-tris(4-bromo phenyl)benzene and [Pd(PPh3)4] were 

added in a round-bottom flask containing triethyl phosphite. The resulting reaction mixture 

was refluxed, under N2 atmosphere, on a sand bath for approximately 48 h. After cooling 

to ambient temperature, the resulting dark solution was placed under reduced pressure in 

order to remove the excess of triethyl phosphite. The resulting residue was purified by 

flash column chromatography using dichloromethane/methanol (97%/3%) as eluent. The 

phosphohexaethyl ester intermediate IL
4
 organic molecule was obtained as a yellow and 

viscous oil, becoming a powder, in 53% yield, when dried under vacuum.  

The quest for faster synthetic approaches and better reaction yields, led to the use of 

the microwave-assisted approach to isolate the intermediate hexaethyl ester of H6L. 

Experiments were performed in an Ethos SYNTH microwave labstation (Milestone Inc.) 

apparatus, by using glassware setup for atmospheric-pressure reactions (temperature 

measured with a fiber-optic probe). A reaction mixture composed of 1,3,5-tris(4-

bromophenil)benzene, [Pd(PPh3)4] and triethyl phosphite were added to a two-neck flask 

fitted with a reflux condenser and a temperature probe. The reaction mixture, under N2 

atmosphere, was irradiated using different powers (400, 500, 600, 700 and 800 W). 

Nevertheless, even using 800 W of power, the desired temperature was not achieved. 

Therefore, a weflon bar was placed into the reaction medium and in this way it was 

possible to reflux the reaction mixture [triethyl phosphite (used as reagent and solvent) 

does not absorb very well the microwave irradiation, becoming the heating process very 

difficult or, even, impossible in order to reach the desired temperature]. During our 

attempts the reaction time was also varied (ranging from 1 to 6 h). However, controlling, 

frequently, the reaction by TLC it was observed that almost all starting reagent was not 

converted. 

 Other microwave-assisted equipment was tested: CEM Focused Microwave 

Synthesis System Discover S-Class apparatus. After some experiments, this equipment was 

selected as the best choice for the preparation of the hexaethyl ester intermediate of H6L 

(IL
4
). The first step involved a Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction (Scheme 2.7). A 

reaction mixture composed of 1,3,5-tris(4-bromophenyl)benzene, [Pd(PPh3)4] and triethyl 

phosphite was prepared inside a 10 mL IntelliVent microwave reactor and refluxed, using a 

weflon bar (see Experimental Section for further details). When the reaction was 

completed, the excess of triethyl phosphite was distilled under reduced pressure and the 

hexaethyl ester intermediate IL
4
 was purified by flash column chromatography using a 

mixture of dichloromethane/methanol (97%:3%) as eluent. The obtained oily residue was 

washed with petroleum ether in an ultrasonic bath affording the target compound as a 

white powder in 83% yield.

Acid hydrolysis 

The second reaction step was based on an acid hydrolysis. The reaction started by 

preparing a mixture composed of an aqueous solution of HCl (6 M) and the intermediate 

IL
4 

compound and kept it under reflux for 2 days. After characterization by NMR 

spectroscopy, the NMR spectra suggest us that the hydrolysis was incomplete.  

Then, the intermediate IL
4 

compound was mixed with an aqueous solution of 

concentrated HCl and the mixture was refluxed for 2 days, under constant magnetic stirring 

(Scheme 2.7). The reaction was stopped after the formation of a brownish viscous residue. 

The resulting mixture was washed with dichloromethane (to extract some organic 

impurities or secondary less polar compounds) and the brownish viscous residue was 

dissolved with methanol. After distillation of methanol, we obtained again a brownish 

viscous residue which was redissolved in methanol, adding then dry toluene and dry 

hexane (1:1). This procedure aims at a more efficient drying of the desired compound. It 

afforded the formation of a yellowish foam which was dissolved in a small amount of dry 

methanol giving raise H6L as a white powder in a 93% yield (see Experimental Section for 

further details). 

 

2.6.2. Structural Elucidation 

 

The intermediate IL
4
 compound and the desired large tripodal organic linker H6L, 

obtained as crystalline compounds, allowed us to solve their crystal structure by single-

crystal X-ray diffraction (Figures 2.10 and 2.11). Both compounds were also characterized 

by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry.

The 
1
H NMR spectrum of IL

4
 shows, in the aliphatic region, a resonance signal as a 

triplet (J(
1
H-

1
H) = 7.1 Hz) centered at ? 1.36 ppm attributed to the protons of the methyl 

groups. Between ? 4.12 and 4.21 ppm there is a multiplet corresponding to the protons of 

the methylene moieties. In the aromatic region it is possible to observe: i) between ? 7.77 

and 7.81 ppm a multiplet belonging to the resonance of the H3 protons; ii) a singlet at ? 

7.83 ppm attributed to the three H6 aromatic protons located in the central ring; and iii) 

another multiplet between ? 7.91 and 7.98 ppm corresponding to H2 protons (Figure 2.12). 

The 
13

C NMR spectrum provides several signals belonging to the IL
4
 intermediate 

molecule. At ? 16.3 ppm there is the signal of the methyl groups as a doublet (J(
13

C-
31

P) = 

6.3 Hz) and at ? 62.2 ppm the resonance of the methylene groups also as a doublet (J(
13

C-
31

P) = 5.5 Hz). At higher chemical shifts the spectrum has several and very close peaks, 

being difficult their assignment: 126.1, 126.9, 127.3 (d, J(
13

C-
31

P) = 15.2 Hz), 132.4 (d, 

J(
13

C-
31

P) = 10.2 Hz), 141.6 and 144.4 (J(
13

C-
31

P) = 3.0 Hz). In the TOF MS ES
+
 spectrum 

we can observe two peaks of IL
4
 at m/z: 715.2 (M+H)

+
 and 737.2 (M+Na)

+
. 

The 
1
H NMR spectrum only provides, as expected, resonance signals of the H6L 

organic linker in the aromatic region. Therefore, between ? 7.78 and 7.85 ppm it is possible 

to find the resonances of the H3 protons as a multiplet. The H2 protons are located, as a 

multiplet, between ? 7.97 and 8.10 ppm (being the last peak overlapped). The remaining 

resonance appears as a singlet at ? 8.01 ppm corresponding to the H6 protons. As 

mentioned in the description of the 
1
H NMR spectrum, in the 

13
C NMR spectrum of H6L it 

is only observed resonance signals in the aromatic region: 125.2, 127.0 (d, J(
13

C-
31

P) = 

14.3 Hz), 131.2 (d, J(
13

C-
31

P) = 10.0 Hz), 132.1, 134.5, 141.1 and 142.2 (d, J(
13

C-
31

P) = 

2.8 Hz). The 
31

P NMR spectrum of H6L possesses only a resonance as a multiplet between 

? 13.7 and 14.0. After analysis of the high-resolution ESI mass spectrum it is possible to 

observe one peak at m/z 547.0464 (M+H)
+
, which identifies the protonated form of the H6L 

organic ligand.

2.7. Results and Discussion 
 

In this chapter it was documented in detail the synthetic procedures to prepare four 

different phosphonic acid organic linkers to be used for the preparation of 

multidimensional MOFs. The organic ligand 1,4-phenylenebis-(methylene)diphosphonic 

acid (H4pmd) was isolated via an acid hydrolysis using an aqueous solution of HCl (6 M). 

The work-up of the reaction was simple, being only performed a liquid-liquid extraction 

using dichloromethane in order to remove some nonpolar impurities. After evaporation of 

the solvent, under reduced pressure, and washing with acetone, the desired compound was 

obtained in quantitative yields (96%). 

More complex was the synthesis of the tripodal organic compound (benzene-1,3,5-

triyltris(methylene))tri-phosphonic acid (H6bmt). Its preparation started with a Michaelis-

Arbusov reaction by preparing a reaction mixture containing 1,3,5-tris-

(bromomethyl)benzene with triethyl phosphite. The latter reagent was added in excess 

acting as reactant and solvent. After purification the intermediate [hexaethyl(benzene-

1,3,5-triyltris-(methylene))tris(phosphonate)] (IL
1
) compound was obtained, as a colorless 

oil, in 88% yield. After optimization of the reaction conditions, the synthetic route became 

quite simple and IL
1 

can be prepared in large amounts in period of time not so long. The 

second step, in order to isolate the desired H6bmt organic ligand, consists, as for H4pmd, 

in an acid hydrolysis using an aqueous solution of HCl (6 M). The work-up, washing and

drying process to obtain H6bmt was very similar as for H4pmd, and the resulting 

compound was obtained in 92% yield. 

The preparation of the fluorinated tripodal ((2,4,6-trifluorobenzene-1,3,5-triyl)tris-

(methylene))triphosphonic acid (H6tftp) linker comprised a three-step reaction: i) 

chloromethylation reaction; ii) Michaelis-Arbusov reaction; and iii) acid hydrolysis. The 

chloromethylation method is a kind of Friedel-Crafts reaction, consisting in an aromatic 

electrophilic substitution using aluminium chloride (AlCl3) as catalyst. This reaction 

started with the preparation of a reactive mixture composed of 1,3,5-trifluorobenzene, 

chloromethyl methyl ether (used in excess displaying the role of reactant and solvent) and 

AlCl3. This reaction required care: i) the constant use of gloves and laboratory glasses; ii) 

the handling of AlCl3 (explosive when in contact with water and in humid atmospheres, 

this reactant become highly acid), and chloromethyl methyl ether (it has toxicity and 

carcinogenic features) always inside a hood fume. The chloromethylation reaction 

employed to prepare the intermediate compound 1,3,5-tris(chloromethyl)-2,4,6-

trifluorobenzene (IL
2
) afforded several secondary products. The intermediate IL

2
 

compound
 
(purified by flash column chromatography) was obtained in 71% yield. The 

synthetic methodologies to isolate hexaethyl((2,4,6-trifluorobenzene-1,3,5-

triyl)tris(methylene))tris-(phosphonate) (IL
3
) and H6tftp consists in a Michaelis-Arbusov 

reaction and an acid hydrolysis, respectively. The procedures to perform both reactions 

were very similar to that described for H6bmt. The intermediate IL
3
 and the desired H6tftp 

were obtained in 75% and 98% yields, respectively. 

The fourth organic linker prepared during this work was the large tripodal H6L. Its 

synthesis comprises a Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction and an acid hydrolysis. At the 

beginning the intermediate compound IL
4
, prepared from a reactive mixture composed of 

1,3,5-tris(4-bromophenil)benzene, [Pd(PPh3)4] and triethyl phosphite, using conventional 

heating methods, was isolated in low reaction yields and the reaction took large periods of 

time. Nevertheless, changing this method for a simpler and economical-friendly approach, 

in this case microwave-assisted synthesis, IL
4
 was obtained in a faster way and in much 

higher yields (83%). The employed high temperatures, the pressure (100 psi) generated 

inside the reactor seems to be the key reaction parameter to prepare IL
4
 in a quickly way 

and in large amounts. The second step was based on an acid hydrolysis. The procedure to 

perform this reaction suffers some modifications when compared for that to obtain H4pmd, 

H6bmt and H6tftp. The hydrolysis of IL
4
 was carried out using concentrated HCl (12 M) 

instead an aqueous solution of HCl (6 M) and the period of time required was longer (2 

days). This fact may be attributed to the increase of the non-polarity of the intermediated 

phosphohexaethyl ester IL
4
, once this has four aromatic rings instead of one as H4pmd, 

H6bmt and H6tftp. The work-up of the final reaction mixture was performed in similar 

fashion to those of previous organic linkers. To isolate the large tripodal H6L as white 

powder it was needed to use a particular drying procedure (a mixture of dried hexane and 

dried toluene). H6L was obtained in a high reaction yield (93%). 

Regarding all the employed synthetic routes reported in this chapter, one can 

conclude that they are good choices to isolate phosphohexaethyl ester intermediates and 



Chapter 2

the corresponding phosphonic acid organic linkers in short periods of time and with high 

reaction yields:  

i) the Michaelis-Arbusov method, a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction, is a very 

simple and efficient alternative to prepare phosphohexaethyl ester intermediates, 

which does not represent any risk for the human health. The use of triethyl 

phosphite as solvent and reactant at the same time, allows the synthesis of those 

intermediate compounds in a fast way, high yields and without the formation of 

more secondary products than when using other organic solvents (i.e., toluene or 

xylene). This method also allows the scale-up of the reaction in order to obtain the 

desired organic molecules in large amounts. The unique inconvenient resides in the 

distillation, under reduced pressure, of triethyl phosphite (being this procedure 

performed inside a hood fume using a quite complex system), and the need of high 

temperatures to carry out the reaction; 

ii) the Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction showed is a good choice for the reaction 

between an aryl halide and triethyl phosphite. Compared with the Michaelis-

Arbusov methodology, which does not need the use of any catalyst to isolate 

phosphohexaethyl ester intermediates, the reaction of aryl halide with trialkyl 

phosphite only occurs if we use a catalyst (in this case, the Pd-based catalyst 

[Pd(PPh3)4]). As for the previous described method, high temperatures are needed. 

Despite the high reaction temperature, it is not enough to isolate the desired 

compound in high yields and for short periods of time. This fact was detected when 

the reaction mixture was refluxed, containing the appropriate aryl halide, triethyl 

phosphite and [Pd(PPh3)4], using conventional heating processes. Therefore, 

performing the Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction using the simpler and less 

energy-consuming microwave-assisted approach, the desired phosphohexaethyl 

ester intermediate was quickly (much faster than by using conventional heating) 

isolated in high yields. Despite the high temperature employed, the generated 

pressure inside the reactor played an important role in the synthesis of the desired 

compound. In addition, the scale-up of this reaction seems to be not very complex if 

a bigger reactor (as for instance, with 35 mL of capacity) is used, and a restricted 

control of the pressure generated inside the reactor to prevent accidents (i.e., 

explosion). The inconvenient of this reaction follow the same line of the Michaelis-

Arbusov method: the distillation of triethyl phosphite, under reduced pressure, 

inside of a hood fume and the need of high temperatures to perform the reaction; 

iii) Conventional acid hydrolysis proved to be a very efficient approach toward the 

hydrolysis of large amounts of phosphohexaethyl ester intermediate in order to 

produce the desired acid phosphonic organic linkers. The use of this type of 

reaction is very simple since it is only needed to mix the phosphohexaethyl ester 

compound with an aqueous solution of HCl. While an aqueous solution of HCl (6 

M) is enough to hydrolyze all the phosphodiethyl ester groups of the intermediate

organic molecules with only an aromatic ring, for the compound with four aromatic 

rings the use of concentrated HCl is fundamental.

knowledge, firstly reported by our research group.

3.1. Initial Considerations 

 

This chapter gives particular attention to the synthesis of several 1D and 3D MOFs 

using the bipodal phosphonate-based organic linker 1,4-phenylenebis(methylene)-

diphosphonic acid (H4pmd).  

The structure of H4pmd (Scheme 2.4) contains an 1,4-dissubstituted aromatic ring 

with two methylenephosphonic acid groups, with the ?CH2 moieties grant it some 

flexibility. This organic linker has been widely employed in the preparation of inorganic-

organic hybrid materials. The studies have been focused in the self-assembly of structures, 

typically under hydro(solvo)thermal conditions, which vary from 1D to 3D networks by 

combining residues of H4pmd
1-2 with, mainly, transition metals (Ni2+, Mn2+, Cd2+, Co2+, 

Zn2+ and Cu2+)3-9 and p-block (Ga3+, Sn2+ and Pb2+)10-12. To the best of our knowledge, our 

research group reported the synthesis of the first multidimensional MOFs combining the 

bipodal organic molecule H4pmd with lanthanides: i) two isotypical 3D materials 

[Ce(Hpmd)(H2O)] and [Pr(Hpmd)(H2O)];
13 recently, ii) five different Lanthanum-based 

MOFs, being one 1D ([La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)12]) and four 3D ([La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)2], 

[La(H3pmd)(H2pmd)(H2O)], [La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)2] and [La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)4]).
14 

In this chapter it is described the preparation of several Lanthanide-Organic 

Frameworks from the self-assembly of H4pmd with lanthanides. On the one hand, a family 

of isotypical compounds, formulated as [Ln(Hpmd)(H2O)] [where Ln
3+ = Eu3+ (1), Gd3+ 

(2) and Tb3+ (3)], was isolated by using three different approaches: i) conventional 

hydrothermal synthesis starting from the hydrolyzed ligand; ii) a rapid “five-second” 

method based on microwave-assisted synthesis (MWAS); and iii) the ultrasonic method, a 

novel heating approach in this field of research, allowing a drastic reduction of the required 

temperature to ambient temperature, which, at the same time, clearly promoted the 

formation of nano-sized crystallites (average length between 100 and 200 nm from visual 

inspection of SEM pictures). On the other hand, five novel MOF structures were 

discovered by employing the MWAS approach and a bench procedure coined as one-pot 

method. Large crystals of [La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)12] (4) and [La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)2] (5), 

formulated on the basis of single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies, were directly isolated 

from the reaction vials via filtration from the reaction products of both MWAS and the 

one-pot approaches. Small crystals of [La(H3pmd)(H2pmd)(H2O)] (6) were found as 

impurities in some MWAS experiments. Samples from the one-pot reactions yielded 

crystals of [La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)2] (7) and powders of [La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)4] (8). 

The crystalline structure of all materials were unveiled by single-crystal or powder 

X-ray diffraction and characterized by using standard solid-state techniques 

(thermogravimetry, vibrational spectroscopy (FT-IR and FT-Raman), elemental analysis, 

solid-state NMR and electron microscopy (SEM and EDS)). It is also discussed in detail 

the methodologies and rationale used to obtain the different compounds while comparing 

the structural features, purity, crystallinity, morphology and particle size of the obtaining 

materials.

Coordination Polymers 

 

3.2.1. Synthesis 

3.2.1.1. Synthetic strategy 

 

The hydro-ionothermal synthetic approach previously reported by our group led to 

the direct isolation of [Ce(Hpmd)(H2O)] and [Pr(Hpmd)(H2O)] from the self-assembly of 

lanthanide centers with tetraethyl-p-xylylenebisphosphonate (texbp) in aqueous ionic 

medium.13 For identical composition of the reactive mixtures we described in that report 

that conventional hydrothermal synthesis failed to produce the desired compounds. More 

recent (unpublished) laboratorial work further showed that the same strategy was i) poorly 

reproducible for other lanthanide centers, and that ii) even the use of microwave-assisted 

hydro-ionothermal synthesis did not promote the self-assembly of the primary building 

units (PBUs).  Thus, experimental data strongly suggested that a crucial step for the self-

assembly of the 3D MOF network resided in the ability of texbp to hydrolyze in solution 

the phosphoryl groups: in our original report we focused that i) the addition of water was 

necessary for the reaction and also that, in some cases, ii) the phosphonic acid molecule 

could be directly isolated as a by-product (thus supporting the assumption of in situ 

hydrolysis). In order to expand the series of this material to the remaining lanthanide 

centers we used instead the hydrolyzed molecule, 1,4-

phenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid (H4pmd). Because the resulting 

[Ln(Hpmd)(H2O)] [where Ln
3+ = Eu3+ (1), Gd3+ (2) and Tb3+ (3)] materials were isolated 

using less mild reaction conditions (180 ºC for 72 h), we employed different synthetic 

methods (microwave- and ultrasound-assisted synthesis) to prepare the desired materials in 

a simple and faster way, at mild conditions and as isolated nanoparticles. 

 

3.2.1.2. Conventional Hydrothermal Synthesis 

  

Hydro(solvo)thermal synthesis is the most used synthetic approach used to obtain 

MOFs as large single-crystals. Here, it is reported the synthesis of isotypical 3D MOFs, 

formulated as [Ln(Hpmd)(H2O)] [where Ln
3+ = Eu3+ (1), Gd3+ (2) and Tb3+ (3)], sharing 

identical crystal structures, isolated from the self-assembly between the bipodal H4pmd 

organic linker with the respective lanthanide(III) chloride hydrates, under typical 

hydrothermal conditions (180 ºC for 72 h; see sub-section 8.10.1.1 in the Experimental 

Section for further details). 

Opposite to expected, the resulting materials were isolated as microcrystalline 

powders. Therefore, and after several attempts, the isolation of [Ln(Hpmd)(H2O)] 

materials as single-crystals was not possible. Consequently, phase identification only could 

be performed from full Rietveld refinement (see sub-section 8.10.1.1 in the Experimental 

Section for further detailed information on crystal and structure refinement). Figure 3.1

shows the final Rietveld plot for compound 1 and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 

images illustrating the morphologic features. A careful analysis of this set of data and 

subsquent comparison with the previously reported [Ce(Hpmd)(H2O)] and 

[Pr(Hpmd)(H2O)] materials lead us to conclude that all compounds have the same crystal 

structure.13

and blue lines, respectively. Green vertical bars indicate the angular positions of the 
allowed Bragg reflections. Refinement details are given in Experimental Section. 
Inset: SEM images of compound 1. 

 

 

Figure 3.2 depicts the powder X-ray diffraction patterns of compounds 2 and 3 and 

their respective SEM images. These compounds share identical crystal structures with 1, as 

described above, and also have very similar crystal morphologies.  

Comparing with the hydro-ionothermal synthetic approach, we found that the 

conventional hydrothermal method employing the previously synthesized H4pmd molecule 

and the same reaction conditions (temperature of 180 ºC and 3 days of reaction), is 

significantly more reproducible and controllable. This leads to the desired materials as

3.2.1.3. Microwave-Assisted Hydrothermal Synthesis 

  

In order to prepare [Ln(Hpmd)(H2O)] materials in a simple and fast way, the 

Microwave-Assisted Synthesis (MWAS) method was employed. This not so commom 

approach, when compared with the conventional hydrothermal approach, has been used for 

the preparation of crystalline multidimensional MOFs. Our group has been adopting this 

synthetic method because it promotes faster and more efficient preparations of functional 

hybrid materials.14-15 The possibility of preparating large amounts of [Eu(Hpmd)(H2O)] (1) 

and [Tb(Hpmd)(H2O)] (3) through the use of the microwave-assisted heating was 

investigated. 

To find the best reaction conditions it was necessary to optimize the synthesis. 

Fixing the power at 50 W, other reaction parameters were tested, such as: i) temperature 

(40, 50, 60, 70, 90, 120 and 150 ºC) and ii) reaction time (5 s, 10 s, 30 s, 1 min and 5 min) 

(see sub-section 8.10.1.2 in the Experimental Section for further synthetic details). It was 

found, after analyzing the powder X-ray diffraction patterns, that the desired materials can 

be readily isolated as phase-pure, in very good yields, at 40 ºC with just 5 seconds of 

reaction time.

 After a careful examination of the SEM images obtained for 1, it is very interesting 

to observe that this compound exhibits an almost homogeneous morphology and crystal 

size distribution both in severe (150 ºC and 5 min of reaction) and in soft (60 ºC and 1 min

of reaction) reaction conditions (Figure 3.3). Aiming to investigate the possibility to further 

decrease the crystal size of compound 3, we reduced both the temperature and the total 

time of the microwave irradiation (Figure 3.4). By reducing this latter parameter a slight 

reduction of the average crystal size was observed (Figure 3.4 top and middle). Crystal size could 

be further decreased by also reducing the temperature to 50 ºC (Figure 3.4 bottom). Noteworthy, 

and as mentioned above, compound 3 could also be isolated at 40 ºC but for this case the average 

crystal size is relatively identical to that obtained at 50 ºC (data not shown).

3.2.1.4. [Ln(Hpmd)(H2O)] materials as isolated nanoparticles 

  

In the previous subsection it was described the formation of aggregates of 

nanoparticles of compound [Tb(Hpmd)(H2O)] (3) under microwave irradiation. Since the 

preparation of [Ln(Hpmd)(H2O)] [where Ln
3+ = Eu3+ (1) and Tb3+ (3)] materials as isolated

nanoparticles was the goal, several attempts using different methodologies were 

performed:  

 

i) Reverse microemulsion under constant conventional or mechanical stirring: a 

solution composed of Triton X-100, 1-octanol, cyclohexane, TEOS (tetraethyl 

orthosilicate), the organic ligand H4pmd and EuCl3·6H2O was added to another 

containing Triton X-100, 1-octanol, cyclohexane and NH3. The resulting reaction 

mixture was stirred in a conventional stirring plate or in a mechanical stirring 

equipment at ambient temperature during different periods of time (from 1 to 2 

days). After reacting, acetone was added occurring the formation of a precipitate 

which was recovered by decantation and, then, by centrifugation. The precipitate 

was washed with water, ethanol and water again. This methodology was based on a 

published work with some modifications.16 In that work, the authors reported the 

preparation of lanthanide–containing polyoxometalates (POMs) in isolated silica 

nanoparticles. Employing this procedure we were, unfortunately, unable to obtain 

[Ln(Hpmd)(H2O)] [where Ln
3+ = Eu3+ (1) and Tb3+ (3)] materials in isolated silica 

nanoparticles. Additionally, analyzing the resulting materials by powder X-ray 

diffraction (PXRD) it was observed that the resulting precipitate has a PXRD 

pattern with a completely different profile (being also poorly crystalline) than the 

PXRD patterns (data not shown) of compounds 1 and 3. 

 

ii) Reverse microemulsion under ultrasonication: the experimental procedure to 

prepare the final reaction mixture was very similar to that described above. The 

differences reside in the replacement of the stirring methods by ultrasonication and 

the use of shorter reaction times (5 min, 30 min, 1 h and 4h) and temperature 

(ambient, 60 and 70 ºC). The resulting precipitates presented different crystalline 

structures than the desired materials and the encapsulation with silica did not occur. 

 

After all the previous attempts, and following some published reports it was 

decided to employ the ultrasonic-assisted synthesis method without the use of surfactants 

and silica. Ultrasound irradiation arises as an alternative synthetic technique known to be 

used in the preparation of nanoparticles,17-19 MOFs20-23 and, in particular, nanoscale 

MOFs.24-27 

 As for the microwave-assisted approach, the optimization of some reaction 

parameters in order to prepare isolated nanoparticles of 1 and 3 was performed. Therefore, 

optimization was based on the variation of: i) temperature (ambient temperature, 60 and 70 

ºC), ii) time of ultrasonic irradiation (1, 3, 5, 10, 20 and 30 minutes), and iii) 

(Ln3+:H4pmd:H2O) molar ratio (1:1:600, 1:1:1200, 1:1:1800, 1:1:3600 and 1:1:7200). After 

optimization, some important conclusions can be inferred from the collected data:  

i) phase-pure 1 was only isolated when the reaction temperature was near the 

ambient temperature. Higher temperatures lead to the formation of secondary 

phases (left column in Figure 3.5);  



Chapter 3 

100                                                              
 

ii) below 3 minutes of ultrasonic irradiation the reaction product was 

systematically poorly crystalline and probably contaminated with an 

unidentified phase. For longer irradiation times, 1 was isolated as a phase-pure 

compound with particle morphology independent of the time (middle column 

in Figure 3.5);  

iii) while a Ln3+:H4pmd:H2O molar ratios of 1:1:600 (reaction condition used for 

conventional hydrothermal and microwave-assisted synthesis) and 1:1:1200 

produce distinct phase from the aimed material, higher diluted solutions yield 

always the desired phase-pure materials (right column in Figure 3.5). 

  In short, it was found that the optimal conditions to prepare isolated nanoparticles 

of 1 and 3 are the following: 5 minutes of ultrasonic irradiation at ambient temperature 

with a 1:1:7200 molar ratio (see sub-section 8.10.1.3 in the Experimental Section for 

further reaction details). Nano-sized crystallites prepared under ultrasonic irradiation have 

been subjected to a myriad of comparative characterization studies with microcrystalline 

bulk materials so to unequivocally prove the structural resemblance between the isolated 

materials (Figure 3.6). For example, the highly sensitive photoluminescence studies of 

compound 1 showed that the Eu3+ cation shares the same local coordination environment in 

both the isolated nano-crystals (prepared under ultrasonic irradiation) and in the bulk 

microcrystalline material.

3.2.2. Crystal Structure Description 
  

 [Ln(Hpmd)(H2O)] compounds [where Ln
3+ = Eu3+ (1), Gd3+ (2) and Tb3+ (3)] share 

identical crystal structures with [Ce(Hpmd)(H2O)] and [Pr(Hpmd)(H2O)].
13  In this section 

we shall only focus on structure 1 with the structural features described in the following 

paragraphs being valid for all remaining compounds of the series. 

Compound 1 has a single Eu3+ site which is coordinated to one water molecule and to 

five phosphonate groups, overall describing a {EuO7} seven-coordinated environment 

whose geometry resembles a significantly distorted monocapped trigonal prism (Figure 

3.7). O(4) and O(5) belong to the same phosphonate group which O,O-chelates to the 



Chapter 3 

102                                                              
 

metallic centre via a bite angle of 56.76(5)º (see Table A.1.1 in the appendices for further 

details), in good agreement with the value reported for the Ce3+ and Pr3+ analogues.  This 

seven-coordination environment can also be described as derived from a highly distorted 

octahedron, in which one of the apical positions is occupied by this chelating moiety 

[Eu(1)–Cg,O(4)/O(5) of 2.274(1) Å], having the cis and trans octahedral angles in the 

ca. 73.00-99.83º and 156.82-174.00º ranges, respectively.  

 

 

Figure 3.7 - Schematic representation of the distorted {EuO7} monocapped trigonal 
prismatic coordination polyhedra present in [Eu(Hpmd)(H2O)] (1).  For selected bond 
lengths (in Å) and angles (in degrees) see Table A.1.1.  Symmetry transformations 
used to generate equivalent atoms: (i) 2-x, 1-y, -z; (ii) 3-x, -y, -z; (iii) 2-x, -y, -z. 
 

 

The material contains two independent phosphonate moieties, each belonging to a 

distinct organic ligand located at a crystallographic inversion center.  The fully 

deprotonated phosphonate moiety is that O,O-chelated to Eu3+, and promotes the formation 

of lanthanide dimers having a Eu···Eu intermetallic distance of ca. 4.05 Å (Figure 3.8). 

The same terminal group also connects adjacent dimers along the [010] direction of the 

unit cell (closest Eu···Eu distance of ca. 5.11 Å), leading to the formation of a one-

dimensional (1D) zigzag array as depicted in Figure 3.9a.  Noteworthy, the registered 

intermetallic distances are smaller than those reported by us for the Ce3+ and Pr3+ analogue 

compounds, agreeing well with the expected contraction of the lanthanide radii. Bridges 

between 1D arrays are ensured by strong O–H···O hydrogen bonds (green dashed lines in 

Figure 3.8a) involving the hydrogenophosphonate and the coordinated water molecule (i.e., 

donor groups): on the one hand, the coordinated water molecule is engaged in two 

interactions with neighboring (hydrogeno)phosphonate moieties (O···O distances of about 

2.64 and 2.77 Å); on the other, the same hydrogenophosphonate which accepts the 

hydrogen from the coordinated water donates its proton to the neighbouring phosphonate 

group (O···O distance of about 2.88 Å).  Noteworthy, this arrangement of supramolecular 

interactions promotes structural cohesion within the inorganic lanthanide 

(hydrogeno)phosphonate layer (Figure 3.8c).  Indeed, upon heating, it was not observed a 

discrete release of the coordinated water molecule without structural modification.

Instead, the sudden release of water (at high temperatures) is concomitant with the collapse 

of the framework (see following section), thus providing additional evidence for structural 

importance of these interactions.

distances due to the different coordination modes of the chelating phosphonate 
moieties. (c) Perspective view along the [100] direction of the unit cell of the crystal

3.2.3. Thermogravimetry and Variable Temperature Powder X-ray 

Diffraction Studies 
  

 The thermal behavior of [Ln(Hpmd)(H2O)] materials has been investigated between 

ambient temperature and ca. 800 ºC (see tabulated data in the Experimental Section for 

further details). Even though the decomposition pathway seems to have different kinetics 

according to the lanthanide centre, overall the processes are relatively similar (see Figure 

A.1.1 in the appendices for further details).  For the particular case of 1, as clearly 

evidenced by the in situ variable-temperature powder X-ray diffraction studies (Figure 

3.9a), the framework is thermally robust up to ca. 260 ºC with no visible modifications 

(peak presence or intensity) being noticeable in the diffractograms.  This was further 

confirmed using vibrational spectroscopy (data not shown): the FT-IR spectrum of a 

portion of 3 placed inside an oven at 230 ºC for 3.5 hours is completely identical to that of 

the as-prepared material. It is noted that up to ca. 260 ºC the weight loss is negligible 

(Figure 3.9b) and may be attributed, mainly, to the release of adsorbed water molecules. 



Chapter 3 

104                                                              
 

 At higher temperatures (above ca. 290 ºC) there is an abrupt weight loss up to 

ca. 450 ºC, globally corresponding to ca. 6.5% in mass, which clearly exceeds the expected 

value for the complete release of the stoichiometric amount of coordinated water molecules 

(4.15%). It is, thus, feasible to assume that above 290 ºC there is, in a first stage, a 

complete release of these water molecules with the framework retaining its crystallinity (up 

to ca. 350-365 ºC); in a second stage, the extra weight loss may be attributed to the partial 

dehydration of the material from the protonated P–OH groups, with this process ultimately 

leading to the concomitant collapse of the framework (as clearly shown in the variable-

temperature powder X-ray diffraction studies).

3.2.4. Vibrational Spectroscopy Studies 

  

The vibration modes of the [Ln(Hpmd)(H2O)] materials reported in this chapter 

were fully studied. A reliable assignment of the vibrational spectra of the compounds 

requires the support from computational calculated data. In Figures A.1.2 and A.1.3 (in the 

Appendices) are represented the FT-IR and Raman spectra of compounds 1-3. 

Experimental and calculated data for compound 3 are given in Tables A.1.2 and A.1.3 in 

the Appendices. 

The FT-IR and Raman spectra of the four materials are very similar with the 

exception of a handful of bands. These differences are summarized in Table 3.1. The 

typical lanthanide contraction along the series can explain the observed differences, which 

is accompanied by variations in bonding forces and lengths. In the FT-Raman spectra the

most prominent difference between the spectra concerns the combination of ?(PO3) + 

?(CH2) vibrational modes varying from 345 to 350 cm
-1 from 1 to 3 (calcd. 343 cm-1).

In order to unequivocally confirm the assignment performed by the theoretical 

calculations, compound 1 was also prepared in D2O (1D).  A number of modifications are 

clearly visible in the spectra (Figure 3.10).  Upon deuteration, some vibrations related to 

the O–H normal modes are absent. For example, ?(POH) is absent with the concomitant 

appearance of ?(POD) (Figure 3.10 and Table 3.2).  Other vibrations are also affected by 

deuteration, because the O–D is a small contributor; for example ?(POH) + ?(CH2) at 1220 

cm-1 is shifted.  Noteworthy, this study allowed us to identify two important vibrations 

related to water below 1800 cm-1. In particular, the twisting mode vibration [?(H2O)] at 

about 660 cm-1 arises from coordination to the metal centre. Below 600 cm-1 the spectrum 

was widely affected by the deuteration. This is due to the appearance of new bands for the 

?(POD) and ?(D2O) vibrations, the change of unobserved bands of 1 corresponding to the 

vibrations of coordinated water, and to other combination vibrations which have a small 

contribution of the O-D vibration modes.

3.2.5. Photoluminescence 

  

The presence of optically active metallic centers (i.e., Eu3+ and Tb3+) in the 

structure of MOFs allows the conversion of UV radiation into visible light. In the next 

paragraphs, it is reported the photoluminescent properties of the [Eu(Hpmd)(H2O)] (1), as 

well as its deuterated form [Eu(Hpmd)(D2O)] (1D), and the [Tb(Hpmd)(H2O)] (3) 

materials. 

Figure 3.11a displays the 300 K excitation spectra of compounds 1 and 1D, 

monitored within the Eu3+ 5D0?
7F2 transition. The broad UV band (ca. 240-340 nm) is 

attributed to the ?-?* transitions associated with the organic linkers, which is also present 

in the same wavelength range in the 11 K excitation spectrum of [Gd(Hpmd)(H2O)] (2) 



1D and 3D MOFs Based on 1,4-Phenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid 

                                                       107 
 

monitored at 445 nm (Figure 3.11b). The spectra are dominated by a series of sharp lines 

assigned to the 7F0,1?
5D0-4, 

5L6, 
5G2-6, 

5H3-7 and 
5F1-5 Eu

3+ intra-4f6 transitions. The 300 K 

excitation spectrum of 3 (Figure 3.11b) is dominated by a similar intense broad band 

centered at about 266 nm arising from the ???* electronic transition associated with the 

organic moiety, which matches satisfactorily with the excitation profile of 2 recorded at 11 

K (Figure 3.11b). The intra-4f8 transition between the 7F6 ground state and the 
5D4?0 and 

5GJ excited states of Tb
3+ are noticeable weaker. This demonstrates that the H4pmd is a 

more suitable ligand to sensitize the Tb3+ cations than the Eu3+ ones via an energy transfer 

process, the so-called antenna effect. In this context, while Tb3+ is reasonable activated by 

the indirect ligand excitation, a direct excitation is more effective for the Eu3+ emission. 

As expected the emission spectra of compounds 1 and 1D at 300 K present a very 

similar profile (Figure 3.12a). They present, however, distinct emission features as 

discussed in more detail below. The emission spectra exhibit a series of narrow lines 

ascribed to the Eu3+ 5D0?
7F0-4 transitions; the 

5D0?
7F5,6 transitions are not experimentally 

detected. The 11 K emission spectra (Figure 3.12b for 1D) permit to unravel the local-field 

splitting of the 7F1,2 levels into 4 and, at least, 7 Stark components, respectively. These 

observations are apparently contradictory to the crystallographic studies which call for the 

presence of a single Ln3+ site (maximum of 3 and 5 Stark components for the 7F1,2 levels, 

respectively).  

The detection of a single non-degenerated 5D0?
7F0 transition and the identical 

time-resolved emission spectra profile for very distinct initial delays and integration times, 

suggest, however, that the low intensity supplementary emission lines should be attributed 

to vibronic emission. In fact, the energy difference relatively to the 5D0?
7F0 transition 

match well with vibrations observed by FT-IR and FT-Raman studies, namely those at ca. 

428 and 1025 cm-1 most likely assigned to ?(PO3) and ?(PO3) vibronic modes (Tables 

A.1.2 and A.1.3 in the appendices). Because the phosphonate groups compose the second 

coordination sphere of the Eu3+ ions, a vibronic coupling between both species can be 

expected. Considering this, Eu3+ emission spectroscopy suggests the presence of a single 

Eu3+ local site without inversion centre (higher intensity for the 5D0?
7F2 transition). 

Moreover, the integrated intensity ratio between the 5D0?
7F2 and 

5D0?
7F1 transitions,

, is for 1 ca. 3.29, which is significantly higher than the 0.68 value 

reported for a centrosymmetric Eu3+ emitting center.28 As described from the 

crystallographic studies the seven-coordinated environment of Eu3+ resembles a highly 

distorted {EuO7} monocapped trigonal prism.  Thus, the point group of Eu
3+ is C1, which 

agrees well with the information derived from the Eu3+ emission spectroscopy.

The 5D0 decay time was measured for 1 and 1D while monitoring the strongest 
7F2 

Stark component. Experimental data are well described by single-exponential functions for 

both cases (exemplified in Figure 3.13 for the data collected at 300 K), yielding lifetimes 

of 0.58±0.01 and 1.98±0.01 ms at 300 K, and of 0.66±0.01 and 2.24±0.01 ms at 11 K for 1 

and 1D, respectively. This is further proof of the presence of a unique Eu
3+ crystallographic 

site and clearly demonstrates the improvement of the decay time (ca. 3.4 times) with the 

substitution of the coordinated water molecule by a deuterated one, leading to the 

suppression of emission quenching through the coupling of the Eu3+ excited states with the 

vibrational states of the O–H oscillators. Note that, the temperature quenching effect is 

negligible when compared to that arising from the O–H groups.

Based on the emission spectra, 5D0 lifetimes and empirical radiative and non-

radiative transition rates, and assuming that only non-radiative and radiative processes are 

involved in the depopulation of the 5D0 state, the 
5D0 quantum efficiency, q

29-33
 was 

determined for 1 and 1D, establishing the effect of the coordinated water molecule on the 

reduction of the emission efficiency. The number of coordinated water molecules was also 

evaluated.34 This data, including the absolute emission quantum yield (measured 

experimentally), are collected in Table 3.3 for both compounds.

Because of the resemblances between the emission spectra (Figure 3.12), compounds 

1 and 1D also have very similar 
5D0 radiative transition rates. The huge increase observed 

in the 5D0 lifetime for the deuterated form is mainly due to the drastic decrease of the non-

radiative transition rate, promoted by the suppression of the O–H oscillators. Therefore, the 
5D0 quantum efficiency increases strongly from 16% to 54%. The absolute emission 

quantum yield measured at 392 nm (direct excitation of Eu3+) of 1D has a magnified 

increase from 4% to 45%. These results demonstrate the strong quenching effect of the O–

H groups on the photoluminescence of 1. Also, the relative low absolute emission quantum 

yield value measured at 288 nm demonstrates the inefficient energy transfer pathway from 

the ligand moieties to Eu3+. The 5D0 quantum efficiency (q) and the quantum yield (?) are 

related by:35-38 

?=k q 

where the rate k accounts for all processes involved in the sensitization efficiency, defined 

as the efficacy with which energy is transferred from the feeding level (in this case 

essentially the intra-4f 5L6 level) onto the 
5D0 emitting state. In the present example k=0.83 

for 1D, which indicates that ca. 17% of the absorbed light at 392 nm (that essentially 

corresponds to 5L6 absorption, Figure 9) is lost in non-radiative processes before reaching 

the 5D0 emitting state. The estimation of the number of coordinated water molecules, ca. 

1.0, is in good agreement with the performed crystallographic studies. 

The emission spectrum of 3 (Figure 3.14) acquired at ambient temperature 

markedly shows an intense green emission associated with the 5D4?
7FJ transitions typical 

of Tb3+. The 5D4?
7F5 transition centered at ca. 544 nm is the strongest corresponding to 

ca. 57% of the integrated emission spectrum. The absence of transitions between the 

second excited state (5D3 level) indicates an efficient relaxation process from the 
5D3 to 

5D4 

levels, most likely due to resonant energy transfer between adjacent Tb3+ ions which are at 

an short intermetallic distance of ca. 3.99 Å, favourable to the occurrence of this 

mechanism controlled by electric dipole interaction. As discussed above, the relative 

efficient energy transference from the antenna ligand to the emitting 5D4 Tb
3+ excited level 

was ultimately confirmed by measuring an absolute emission quantum yield of ca. 14%, 

which is significantly higher than the values obtained for 1 and 1D under similar excitation.

3.2.6. Heterogeneous Catalysis 

 

The catalytic performances of the microcrystalline bulk [Eu(Hpmd)(H2O)] (1) and 

the nanocrystalline [Eu(Hpmd)(H2O)]nano (1n) materials were investigated in the ring-

opening reaction of styrene oxide (PhEtO) with methanol, at 55 ºC (Scheme 3.1). The 

reaction of PhEtO in the presence of 1 was very sluggish giving 2-methoxy-2-

phenylethanol (MeOPhEtOH) as the only product formed in 7% / 11% yield at 24 h / 48 h 

reaction. It is noted that similar results were observed without adding the catalyst, 

suggesting that 1 does not exhibit significant catalytic activity (Table 3.4). After a 48 h-

batch run the solid material was recovered and characterized by PXRD and SEM. SEM 

images of the recovered solid reveal some morphological changes: bundles (ca. 15 µm 

wide) of very fine needles turned into micro-sized aggregates of irregular morphology. 

Powder X-ray diffraction studies reveal, nevertheless, that the crystal structure of 1 

remained unchanged under the used reaction conditions (Figure 3.15).

The reaction of PhEtO with methanol in the presence of 1n gives MeOPhEtOH in 

quantitative yield within 48 h reaction, at 55 ºC (Table 3.4). These results are far superior 

to those observed for 1. Opposite to that, 1n exhibits excellent regioselectivity to the 

formation of the ?-alkoxy alcohol product. According to the literature, the alcoholysis of 

PhEtO may be favored by the presence of free coordination positions at Lewis acid sites 

for the activation of the PhOEt molecules and the subsequent nucleophilic attack of 

(heteroatom-based nucleophile) methanol at the benzylic carbon atom of the epoxide 

ring.39-40 The SEM images of the recovered solid 1n show that this material remained 

nanocrystalline (ca. 100 nm), forming aggregates of ca. 5-10 µm in diameter. Reducing the 

crystallites size of 1 down to the nano-scale increases the surface area, which expectedly 

enhances the number of accessible active sites, explaining the enhanced catalytic activity 

of 1n in comparison to 1. It is also possible that the active sites correspond to structural 

defects, in which case the reduction of crystallite sizes would expectedly enhance the 

number of external defect sites and consequently the catalytic activity.

For comparative purposes the precursors H4pmd organic linker and EuCl3·6H2O 

were tested as (homogeneous) catalysts in the methanolysis of PhEtO, under similar 

reaction conditions (using molar equivalent amounts to those of ligand and lanthanide, 

respectively, in the loaded 1n catalyst). In the case of H4pmd, MeOPhEtOH is formed in 

quantitative yield within 1 h reaction, indicating that it is a quite active and selective 

Brønsted acid organocatalyst (Table 3.4). Using EuCl3·6H2O MeOPhEtOH is formed in 

79% selectivity at 91% conversion, reached at 48 h reaction, indicating that this precursor 

is less selective than that observed for 1n. Based on these results we may postulate that the 

active sites in 1n may be of the type Brönsted acid and/or coordinatively unsaturated Lewis 

acid sites, which would inherently correspond to structural defect sites.

3.3. Lanthanum-Biphosphonate Coordination Polymers Isolated 

by Microwave-Assisted and One-Pot Synthesis 
 

3.3.1. Synthesis 

3.3.1.1. Synthetic strategy  

  

Microwave-Assisted Synthesis (MWAS) and one-pot method have distinct 

principles and a direct transposition of the experimental conditions from one method to 

another is difficult. While MWAS permits the reduction of reaction time and the possibility 

to control the morphology of the materials,15,41 the one-pot method usually allows growing 

of crystals for single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies while maintaining small reaction 

times.42-43 A systematic variation of the experimental conditions is, thus, pertinent in order 

to obtain (i) phase-pure and (ii) highly crystalline materials while (iii) exhibiting uniform 

crystal habit and size distribution. In order to quickly screen the achieved products in terms 

of purity and morphology, a combination of X-ray diffraction (powder and single-crystal) 

and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used. Replication of the synthetic 

conditions was also performed to test the reproducibility of the present reactive system and 

the results are summarized in the following sub-sections. 

 

3.3.1.2. Microwave-assisted synthesis 

  

Hydrothermal synthesis has been routinely employed as a daily synthetic approach of 

MOFs. In this context, phase-pure [La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)2] (5) was first isolated under 

typical hydrothermal conditions, using convection heating at 180 ºC during 72 h (see sub-

section 8.10.2.1 in the Experimental Section for further details). The crystals obtained 

presented a plate-like morphology having dozens of micrometers. 

Considering that mild and faster conditions are usually preferred, we first transposed 

the preparation of the aforementioned material to MWAS. The presence of three distinct 

phases, as identified by PXRD, was unequivocally confirmed while inspecting the 

influence of the reaction parameters on the purity and crystal habit (see Scheme 3.2). 

Microwave heating was found to be an efficient method to prepare different phases by 

solely changing the reaction temperature: [La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)12] (4) is formed at low 

temperatures (below 40 ºC); [La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)2] (5) is mainly obtained at high 

temperatures, typically above 90 ºC, in line with the results of the static hydrothermal 

conditions. For a mid-range temperature, mixtures of both compounds were always 

observed alongside with the presence of a small amount of [La(H3pmd)(H2pmd)(H2O)] (6). 

Unreacted organic ligand may be found in all prepared materials (except for high 

temperatures). Nevertheless, it does not represent an experimental hindrance because it is 

easily removed from the final product by washing with distilled water. We note that 

grinding the reactant prior to the synthetic procedure can drastically reduce the presence of 

unreacted ligand. 



Chapter 3 

116

4; ???? – phase-pure 5; ???? – [La(H3pmd)(H2pmd)(H2O)] (6); ???? – indicates the presence 
of unreacted organic linker which can be easily removed by washing the products with 
distilled water. The metal-to-ligand molar ratio used in all synthesis is of ca. 1:1. 

 

 

The reaction time does not seem to have a significant influence in the preparation of 

5. The same does not happen for the employed irradiation power. A strict control of the 

reaction temperature is, thus, crucial. It is also noted that using this experimental setup, 

power input may have a great influence in the outcome because it is difficult to maintain 

stable low temperatures while using high irradiation power and vice-versa. 

Besides 4 and 5, the optimization stage also revealed the presence of minor 

quantities of compound 6 as impurity. Optimization of the experimental conditions to 

isolate phase-pure 6 proved unsuccessful. Nevertheless, from the obtained physical 

mixtures and taking into account the considerable differences in particle size and 

morphology, it was possible to manually isolate a crystal representative of each phase. 

These crystals allowed a full structural characterization using single-crystal X-ray 

diffraction studies (see tabulated data in Experimental Section).

3.3.1.3. One-Pot Synthesis 

 

The one-pot methodology is substantially different from MWAS: milder 

temperatures are typically used alongside with no (autogenous) pressure. For each pair of 

temperature/time, the metal-to-ligand molar ratios were varied at the proportions of ca. 1:1 

and 1:2. A second 1:1 trial was performed but diluted to the double, hereafter defined as 

1:1*. As in MWAS, phase-pure products [La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)12] (4) and 

[La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)2] (5) may be readily obtained under various reaction conditions. 

Additionally, two new compounds were found, namely [La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)2] (7) and 

[La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)4] (8). All the materials are crystalline and show particle size in 

the micrometer range, as observed for the samples prepared by MWAS. 

It is noted that this method has the drawback of introducing some randomness in 

the prediction of the phases to be obtained (Scheme 3.3). In opposition to MWAS, where a 

clear evolution of a phase into the other with increasing temperature (the most significant 

reaction parameter) is observed, in the one-pot method the same logical behavior is not 

present.  

As for MWAS, the reaction time does not seem to have a strong influence on the 

obtained compound and the most important parameter is, once again, the temperature. 

Above ambient temperature the composition of the reactive mixtures is also a factor to be 

considered. In spite of a handful of exceptions at 40 ºC, some conclusions can be inferred: 

i) Compound 4 predominates at ambient temperature, whereas compound 5 is 

formed especially at high temperatures (Scheme 3.3); 

ii) In general, compound 8 appears essentially in the 1:1* trials; at 80 ºC this 

compound is even the major product; 

iii)  Higher temperatures and ligand-to-metal molar ratios favor the appearance of 

compound 7; 

iv)  Compounds 7 and 8 can only be prepared (but not isolated as phase-pure) at high 

temperatures (80 ºC). 

In short, we can assume that 4 is the kinetic compound because it is formed at milder 

conditions. On the other hand, 5 seems to be the thermodynamic phase. A higher quantity 

of H4pmd favors the formation of 7 due to its 1:1.5 La:H2pmd stoichiometry, with this 

tendency being enhanced at higher temperatures.

syntheses. The ratio is represented as metal-to-ligand molar ratio. Phase 4 is 
predominant at ambient temperature and 5 is formed preferentially at higher 
temperatures. These two compounds can be isolated as phase-pure in a variety of 
experimental conditions. Compounds 7 and 8 are mostly formed, as main products, at 
high temperatures (80 ºC) and could not be isolated as phase-pure. 
 

 

3.3.2. Crystal Morphology 

 

Crystal morphology varies according to the obtained phase for the two heating 

methods. Crystals of [La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)12] (4) exhibit needle-like morphology for all 

tested reaction conditions, with individual crystallites being stacked into large aggregates 

with varying shape and size. This was also observed for compound 

[La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)2] (5), with the exception of the crystallite habit, which are in this 

case plates.

                                                       119 
 

Comparing the two methods, MWAS originates needles of 4 with lengths typically 

smaller than those obtained by the one-pot methodology. On the other hand, the plate-like 

crystallites of 5 have similar sizes for the two approaches. Concerning crystallite size, 

when MWAS is employed, the size of needles of 4 is generally smaller than the plate-like 

crystallites of 5. In opposition, it is not possible to unequivocally determine the relation in 

size of crystallites of the two compounds for the one-pot method. 

 

 

Figure 3.16 – Powder X-ray diffraction patterns and SEM images of bulk materials 
prepared using MWAS at different temperatures during 5 minutes of reaction: phase-
pure 4, as needle-like crystals, is isolated at low temperatures (30 and 40 ºC) while 
phase-pure 5, comprising plate-like crystals, at 150 ºC (please note: at 90 and 120 ºC 
compound 5 is contaminated with small amounts of 6). Intermediate temperatures (50, 
60 and 70 ºC) promote the preparation of mixtures comprised of both phases 4 and 5.  

 

 

Because the temperature is of crucial importance to isolate phase-pure products it 

is, thus, pertinent to look into more detail to the variation of the average particle size and 

thickness when this parameter is changed. For MWAS, at lower temperatures (e.g., 30 and 



Chapter 3 

120                                                              
 

40 ºC) and irradiation power (10 W) phase-pure 4 is obtained (after removing the excess of 

the organic linker) with particle size ranging from few to tens of micrometers. At 50, 60 

and 70 ºC mixtures of 4 and 5 are isolated (for irradiation powers of 25 and 50 W). 

Crystals of phase-pure 5 begin to appear at 50 ºC becoming predominant above 70 ºC, as 

observed from the combined PXRD and SEM studies given in Figure 3.16. In this case it is 

not possible to conclude on a trend for the variation of the average crystal size. Only at 150 

ºC a significant increase in the crystallite size is observed. However, the emergence of 

[La(H3pmd)(H2pmd)(H2O)] (6) in the reactions performed at 90 and 120 ºC may, 

somehow, inhibit crystal growth. Hence only at 150 ºC there is no interference of 

contaminant species (i.e., free organic ligand or compound 6) and, therefore, the increase 

in particle size is clearly noticeable. 

For the materials obtained at 150 ºC, but using different microwave irradiation 

periods, it seems that reaction time does not have a significant role in the final particle 

morphology and size (Figure 3.17). 

 

 

Figure 3.17 – SEM images of phase-pure [La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)2] (4) prepared 
under microwave irradiation at 150 ºC using different reaction periods. Despite the 
variation of reaction time (from 1 to 10 min), significant variations in crystallite habit 
are not observable: particle size and plate-like morphology remain approximately 
identical. 

 

 

When using the one-pot method and for a metal-to-ligand molar ratio of ca. 1:1, at 

mild temperatures in which compound 4 is predominant (ambient temperature and 40 ºC), 

the increase of the reaction time decreases, in general, the length of the needles. 

Furthermore, the difference in size for these two temperatures is negligible. For higher 

temperatures (60 and 80 ºC) plate-like crystallites of 5 are observed, and the reaction time 

does not affect the particle size. The raise in temperature increases aggregation of particles

and the distribution size for all sample ranges from few micrometers (ca. 2-3 µm) to 

dozens of micrometers (ca. 20-30 µm) (Figure 3.18).

3.3.3. Crystal Structure Description 

  

In this subsection will not be describe in detailed the crystal structure of each 

isolated material. Due to the variety of compounds herein obtained using two different 

synthetic methods, the main objective is based on the comparison of those products 

concerning their purity, crystallinity, morphology and particle size. Therefore, in this 

subsection it is only discussed their general structural features. While compounds 4 to 7 

were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, compound 8 was identified by ab 

initio powder X-ray diffraction studies. For a detailed description on collection of data and 

crystal structure resolution of 4-8 see sub-section 8.10.2.3 in the Experimental Section and

As mentioned above, the present crystallographic description has comparative 

purposes. Therefore, to have more insights about crystal data (i.e., selected bond lengths, 

angles and hydrogen bonding geometry) see Tables A.2.1- A.2.9 in the Appendices. 

 Five different crystal structures, namely [La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)12] (4), 

[La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)2] (5), [La(H3pmd)(H2pmd)(H2O)] (6), [La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)2] (7) 

and [La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)4] (8) [where H4pmd = 1,4-

phenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid), were unveiled in the course of this work. As 

it is shown by the formulae, all compounds appear in three different La : H4-xpmd
-x ratios: 1 

: 1 for 5 and 8; 1 : 1.5 for 4 and 7; 1 : 2 for 6. Except for compounds 4 and 8, which have 

higher contents of water molecules per metal center (6 and 2, respectively), compounds 

typically have a sole water molecule per metal center.  

The coordination number of the La3+ metal centers also varies and is related to the 

kind and hapticity of the coordinated ligands. In 4 the coordination geometry around the 

nonacoordinated metal center resembles a tricapped trigonal prism formed by the 

coordination to six water molecules and three crystallographic independent ?1-O-

hydrogenophosphonato moieties (Figure 3.19). The coordination number of nine is only 

possible given the presence of a large number of small water ligands and a low number of 

bulk H4pmd residues. In compound 5, La
3+ is octacoordinated to five phosphonic residues, 

being two of them O,O’-chelating, and to one water molecule. If we consider the chelating 

phosphonates as single coordination sites, the geometry around the metal center can be 

seen as a highly distorted octahedron (Figure 3.20). The H4-xpmd
-x residues appear in two 

different protonation degrees and hapticities, being one of the type µ2-O,µ2-O’,?
1-O’’-

phosphonate and the other of the type µ2-O,O’-hydrogenophosphonate.  

In 6 and 7, the metal center is heptacoordinated to six non-chelating phosphonic 

residues and to one water molecule. The large number of bulky ligands prevented 

chelation, reducing in this way the coordination number to a considerably low number for 

the La3+ cation. Remarkably, while in 6 the metal center is almost rotosymmetric with the 

coordination environment resembling a distorted pentagonal bipyramid, in 7 the metal 

center resembles a monocapped trigonal prism (Figures 3.21 and 3.22). The refinement of 

the crystal structure of 6 did not permit a clear determination of the protonation sites. 

Excluding the assignment of protonation degree, it is possible to say there are two different 

hapticities for the phosphonate moiety residues, being one µ2-O,O’ and another ?
1-O. In 7 

all the ligand moieties act as µ2-O,O’-hydrogenophosphonates. In compound 8 the metal 

center is octacoordinated. As it happens with compounds 6 and 7, the metal center is, in 8, 

coordinated to six organic residues, which, given their large volume, prevent chelation. 

 However, the high number of organic ligands does not limit the number of water 

molecules, and in this case the metal center is connected to two water molecules. The 

coordination geometry around the metal center resembles a square antiprism (Figure 3.23). 

Given that the model of the crystal structure of 8 was obtained by ab initio solution (Figure 

3.24) from powder X-ray data a clear determination of the proton sites was not possible. 

Excluding the location of the protons, the organic ligands appear as two centrosymmetric

 Given its high number of water ligands, compound 4 is a 1D polymer, in which two 

metallic coordination polyhedra alternate with three bridging H2pmd
2- ligands (Figure 

3.25). The remaining compounds are 3D structures. In spite of having different 

stoichiometries, coordination numbers and dimensionalities, the crystal packing of the five 

compounds is based on the alternation of inorganic layers, containing the {LaOn} 

polyhedra, with organic layers comprising the organic linkers.  

In compounds 5-7 the lanthanide phosphonate layers are disposed perpendicular to 

the c axis while in 8 it is along the a axis (Figures 3.26 and 3.27, respectively). Along the 

inorganic layer, the geometrical arrangement of {LaOn} polyhedra and their connection 

with the phosphonate residues is different for the five structures.  

In 4 the 1D polymer shows two non-directly bonded metal centers at 6.2410(10) Å 

from each other, which are arranged in a slightly distorted close hexagonal packing [other 

La···La distances range between 6.9514(11) and 7.6851(12) Å] (Figures 3.19 and 3.26). 

Only in 5 there is connection between the {LaO8} polyhedra forming a zigzag chain 

parallel to the a-axis of the unit cell, with the La···La intermetallic distances being of 

4.1819(12) and 4.5705(12) Å (Figures 3.20 and 3.26). While the µ2-O, µ2-O’, ?
1-O’’-

phosphonate moiety is embedded in this chain, contributing for its stability, the µ2-O,O’-

hydrogenophosphanate moiety acts as interconnection between chains giving the 2D aspect 

to the inorganic layer.  

In 6, the isolated {LaO7} polyhedra are arranged in the inorganic layer in a 

rectangular grid with the La···La distances being 5.717(2) and 8.694(4) Å. In this 

compound the inorganic layers are disposed in an ABAB··· fashion, where each vertex of 

the grid is aligned with the center of the layer immediately above and below, instead of 

being completely aligned along the c-axis as it happens with the remaining four 

compounds (Figures 3.21 and 3.26). In 7 the {LaO7} polyhedra are arranged in the 

inorganic layer in an elongated open hexagonal packing with the hole centered in the unit 

cell coordinates (½, 0, ½). This is a hydrophilic hole toward which the coordinated water 

molecules and the hydroxyl groups from H2pmd
2- are directed. The distances between 

vertices of the hexagonal pattern (the metal centers) range from 4.756(8) to 6.237(10) Å 

(Figures 3.22 and 3.26).  

In 8 the {LaO8} polyhedra are arranged in a hexagonal fashion along the inorganic 

layer with La···La distances ranging from ca. 5.46 to 6.34 Å (Figures 3.23 and 3.27). The 

two crystallographically independent phosphonate residues are distributed in alternate 

layers along the a axis, i.e., between each three consecutive inorganic layers. The first pair 

is connected by the ligand containing atoms P1, and the other is connected by the ligand 

containing atom P2, or vice-versa.

3.3.4. Thermogravimetric Studies of Phase-Pure Materials 4 and 5 

 

The thermal stability of the bulk (phase-pure) materials 4 and 5 were investigated 

between ambient temperature and ca. 800 ºC (Figure 3.28), providing additional structural 

information on their hydration level. As shown in Figure 3.28, the thermograms of the two 

materials are strikingly distinct reflecting the different chemical composition of the 

compounds.

For 4, three main weight losses are observed. In the 45-130 ºC temperature range the 

compound loses approximately 15.4% of the total weight, which agrees well with the 

release of eleven water molecules per formula unit. This weight loss is slightly smaller 

than the calculated value of about 17.2% corresponding to the twelve water molecules 

(based on the crystallographic studies). However, and as observed for 5, these correspond 

to subsequent weight losses, increasing the difficulty to determine where each loss begins 

and finishes. In that sense, and looking to the slow decrease in weight above 130 ºC we 

believe that both values (observed and calculated) are in good agreement. The latter two 

weight losses, corresponding to a total of ca. 3.1% and ca. 19.4%, were observed in the 

temperature ranges between 200-400 ºC and 490-800 ºC, respectively. It is, thus, feasible 

to assume that they may be attributed to the overlap of the release of the remaining water 

molecules and, lately, to the full decomposition of the organic components and 

concomitant collapse of the crystalline network.  

For 5, the framework is thermally robust up to ca. 230 ºC, after which a weight loss 

corresponding to ca. 3.1% in mass is observed, mainly attributed to the release of 

coordinated water molecules  (calculated value of ca. 4.3% for one molecule per La3+ 

cation). Therefore, it is possible to infer that not all water molecules are released at this 

temperature, being most likely liberated gradually afterwards. At higher temperatures 

(above ca. 450 ºC) there are two subsequent weight losses, globally corresponding to ca. 

4.1% (in 450-640 ºC range) and ca. 18.5% (in 640-800 ºC range), respectively. It is 

feasible to assume that the former weight loss may be attributed to partial dehydration of 

the material from the protonated P–OH groups, leading to the release of approximately one 

water molecule per La3+ cation (calculated value of ca. 4.3%). The latter weight loss could 

arise from the decomposition of the organic component of the framework.  

 

3.3.5. FT-IR Spectroscopy 

 

FT-IR spectroscopy studies clearly support the structural features unveiled by the 

X-ray diffraction studies. Figure 3.29 depicts selected regions in the spectra of phase-pure 

compounds 4 and 5. Relevant differences in some spectral regions are noticeable despite 

their overall identical profiles, with most of these diagnostic bands being assigned to 

vibrational modes of coordinated water molecules. Such differences provide important 

information concerning the different coordination modes of the H4-xpmd
x- residues and the 

chemical environment of the water molecules in the compound. 

The typical ?(O–H) stretching vibrational modes of the coordinated water 

molecules appear in the 3600-3200 cm-1 range. Although below 2500 cm-1 the spectra of 

the two compounds share striking similarities, in the 3600-3200 cm-1 range, which 

corresponds to the vibrations assigned to the coordinated water molecules, there are 

notable differences: while for 4 a large number of bands are scattered in a vast interval 

between ca. 3600 and 2600 cm-1, for 5 two strong bands are located at 3470 and 3395 cm-1. 

This observation is in a clear agreement with the donor···acceptor distances shown in 

Tables A.2.2 and A.2.4 in the appendices: a wider interval of D···A distances was 



Chapter 3 

130                                                              
 

observed for 4 (from ca. 2.71 to 3.30 Å) than for 5 (from ca. 2.82 to 2.91 Å). Large 

internuclear D···A distances imply weaker hydrogen bonds that, ultimately, correspond to 

stronger O–H vibrations that appear at higher wavenumbers. We note that the registered 

wavenumbers are also affected by the D–H···A interaction angle, but in this case the 

variation intervals reproduce the same general trend than that described for the distances. 

Thus, the narrow and strong band located at 3588 cm-1 for 4 is attributed to a water 

molecule with, at least, one proton involved in weak hydrogen bonding interactions. This 

could be assigned either to O1W (with very short D–H···A angles in a bifurcated hydrogen 

bond) or to O6W (which corresponds to the largest D···A distance). In both materials there 

is also a band characteristic of the coordinated water molecules at ca.1600 cm-1. Again, the 

relationship between the observed intervals of internuclear D···A distances and the D–

H···A interaction angle with the variation wavenumbers is observed: the band(s) for 4 is 

(are) considerably larger, clearly corresponding to at least two distinct environments for 

water, in agreement with the structural information described above.

  The PO–H stretching modes were observed at ca. 2300 cm-1 as medium intensity 

bands. The medium intensity peaks between 1700-1500 cm-1 are attributed to the ?(C=CH–

) deformation vibration in 1,4-disubstituted benzene rings. The two peaks at ca. 1400 cm-1 

with medium intensity are attributed to the –CH2– deformation modes from the P–CH2– 

groups. The vibrational modes ?s(P=O), ?s(P–O) and ?s(P–C) appear between 1200-1100 

cm-1 (strong intensity), 1050-900 cm-1(strong intensity) and 800-600 cm-1 (medium 

intensity), respectively.44

3.3.6. Solid-State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) 

 

The presence of the diamagnetic La3+ rare-earth cation in compounds 

[La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)12]  (4) and [La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)2] (5) permits the study of the bulk 

compounds using solid-state NMR, ultimately providing additional information on both the 

purity of the materials and further information on the composition of the asymmetric units.

31P HPDEC MAS spectrum of [La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)12] (4). Spinning 

sidebands are denoted using an asterisk. Peak deconvolution and integration 
throughout the entire spectral range (i.e., including the spinning sidebands) gives a 
ratio of ca. 0.54 : 0.52 : 2.00 for the isotropic resonances at ca. 15.1, 16.1 and 24.2 
ppm, respectively.  

 

 

The isotropic region of the 31P MAS spectra show two well-resolved resonances as 

depicted in Figures 3.30 and 3.31 for 4 and 5, respectively. For compound 4, the less 

deshielded peak is, nevertheless, composed of two resonances peaking at ca. 16.1 and 15.1 

ppm while that at 24.2 ppm is well resolved. Peak deconvolution and integration including 

the spinning sidebands yields a ratio of ca. 2.00 : 0.52 : 0.52 for these resonances, which 

add up to a total of 3 sites for compound 4. The splitting of one resonance may be 

attributed to some structural disorder associated with the phosphonate groups, ultimately 

leading to slightly distinct chemical environments. Nevertheless, for 4, the 13C{1H} CP 

MAS spectrum (Figure A.2.2 in the Appendices) clearly shows two distinct spectral 

regions: the 20-50 ppm spectral range (peaks at 34.1 and 35.4 ppm) is attributed to the –

CH2– groups; the aromatic carbon atoms from the ring appear instead in the 120-140 ppm 

window (peaks at 129.6, 131.3, 131.9 and 133.6 ppm). In addition, the 1H MAS spectrum 

(Figure A.2.1 in the Appendices) is clearly dominated by an intense and narrow resonance 



Chapter 3 

132                                                              
 

at ca. 4.61 ppm attributed to water molecules that are highly mobile in the crystal structure 

of 4. It is also possible to discern in the 1H MAS spectrum the signal arising from the –

CH2– groups (at ca. 1.25 ppm) and a broad band containing both the aromatic protons and 

those associated with the protonated phosphonate moieties. 

 

 

Figure 3.31 – 
31P HPDEC MAS spectrum of [La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)2] (5). Spinning 

sidebands are denoted using an asterisk. Peak deconvolution and integration 
throughout the entire spectral range (i.e., including the spinning sidebands) gives a 
ratio of ca. 1.00 : 1.12 for the isotropic resonances at ca. 26.2 and 10.0 ppm. A small 
impurity present in 5 is identified by a diamond symbol (?). 

 

 

Compound 5 is considerably more crystalline and this fact is also noticeable in the 

corresponding solid-state NMR spectra. Indeed, the 1H MAS spectrum (Figure A.2.3 in the 

Appendices) is much more resolved than that of compound 4, being possible to see the 

resonances arising from the –CH2– groups (at ca. 1.05 ppm), the water molecules (at ca. 

3.27 ppm), the aromatic ring (broad band peaking at ca. 6.42 ppm) and those of the 

considerably deshielded –POH moieties (at ca. 11.1 ppm). As in 4, peak deconvolution and 

integration including the spinning sidebands in the 31P MAS spectrum (Figure 3.31) yields 

a ratio of ca. 1.00 : 1.12 for the resonances peaking at ca. 26.2 and 10.0 ppm, agreeing well 

with the expected two sites with equal occupancy present in the crystalline structure. The 
13C{1H} CP MAS spectrum (Figure A.2.4 in the Appendices) is concordant with that of 

compound 4, exhibiting two clear spectral regions found at ca. 25-50 (for the methylene 

groups) and 120-140 ppm (for the aromatic carbon atoms). It is important to emphasize

that in the former region one can clearly observe two resonances peaking at ca. 39.0 and 

34.6 ppm exhibiting spin multiplets arising from 1JC,P coupling.

3.4. Results and Discussion 

  

Several multidimensional MOFs were successful isolated combining the bipodal 

1,4-phenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid (H4pmd) organic linker with some 

lanthanide centers: i) isotypical 3D [Ln(Hpmd)(H2O)] [where Ln
3+ = Eu3+ (1), Gd3+ (2) and 

Tb3+ (3)] materials; and ii) five different Lanthanum-based MOFs, being one 1D 

([La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)12] (4) and four 3D ([La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)2] (5), 

[La(H3pmd)(H2pmd)(H2O)] (6), [La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)2] (7) and [La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)4] 

(8). The crystalline structures of all materials were carefully investigated and fully 

characterized by using several solid-state techniques (X-ray diffraction (single-crystal or 

powder), vibrational spectroscopy (FT-IR and FT-Raman), electron microscopy (SEM and 

EDS), solid-state NMR, thermogravimetric and elemental analysis). 

Compounds 1-3 were prepared under conventional hydrothermal conditions, 

however, and opposite to expected, this methodology did not afford the desired materials 

as large single-crystals. Therefore, 1-3 were isolated as microcrystalline powders and their 

crystalline structures were unveiled by powder X-ray diffraction. These materials share 

similar architecture to the previously reported [Ce(Hpmd)(H2O)] and [Pr(Hpmd)(H2O)].
13 

Hydrothermal synthesis, using the hydrolyzed H4pmd, showed to be a more efficient and 

reproducible approach than the hydro-ionothermal synthesis which involved the 

combination of lanthanide centers with the phosphoryl ester organic ligand tetraethyl-p-

xylylenebisphosphonate in aqueous ionic medium. Nevertheless, conventional 

hydrothermal synthesis required the employment of high temperatures (180 ºC) and large 

periods of times (72 h). These reaction conditions are not attractive for industry mainly if it 

is intended to scale-up the materials. Having this in mind, the preparation of 1-3 was 

carried out by using a simpler and faster synthetic approach (MWAS). Remakably, 

compounds 1-3 can be isolated at 40 ºC with just 5 seconds of reaction. It was also 

demonstrated that by varying the heating procedure and other synthetic parameters it is 

possible to control crystallite size: while the conventional hydrothermal approach produces 

typically micro-sized crystals, MWAS or ultrasounds-assisted synthesis (USAS), a recent 

synthetic approach in the MOFs field, can isolate 1-3 as nano-sized materials. USAS 

further permits the preparation of the nano-crystals in an isolated fashion. 

Compounds 1-3 were investigated regarding their vibration modes. The preparation 

of the deuterated compound 1D allowed to elucidate the elusive vibrational modes of 

confined (and coordinated) water molecules. Indeed, the combined 

experimental/theoretical study identified most of the bands in the spectra including, for 

example, the rarely-reported twisting vibration of water at about 665 cm-1. 

Variable-temperature powder X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetry studies 

showed that the materials are thermally robust up to ca. 290 ºC: the release of the

coordinated water molecule above this temperature is immediately followed by a collapse 

of the framework. Materials can, in this way, be employed in a robust fashion below this 

temperature without compromising structural integrity and crystallinity. For example, the 

catalytic activity of compound 1 was tested in the methanolysis of styrene oxide, under 

solvent-free conditions at 55 ºC. It was discovered that the crystallite size of 1 plays a 

determinant role in this catalytic system: while microcrystalline 1 does not possess 

significant catalytic activity, the nano-sized counterpart 1n exhibits relatively high 

catalytic activity and excellent selectivity to 2-methoxy-2-phenylethanol (100% yield 

within 48 h reaction). Reduction of the crystallite size promotes an increase of the total 

surface area, which expectedly enhances the number of accessible active sites of 1n. 

Studies using the primary building blocks of 1 (i.e., ligand and metal source) permitted to 

conclude that these active sites of 1n should be of the Brönsted acid type and/or 

coordinatively unsaturated Lewis acid sites, which would inherently correspond to 

structural defect sites. 

The photoluminescent properties of compounds 1 and 3 have been further 

investigated. Photoluminescent studies showed that the organic ligand is a suitable 

sensitizer of Tb3+ (absolute quantum yield as ca. 14%) via the energy transfer process 

called antenna effect, leading to the isolation of an intense green-emitting material. We 

have further shown that the coordinated water molecule to Eu3+ quenches significantly the 

photoluminescence of 1: while at 300 and 11 K this compound exhibits lifetimes of 

0.58±0.01 and 0.66±0.01 ms, respectively, these value are boosted for its deuterated form 

(1D) to 1.98±0.01 and 2.24±0.01 ms, respectively. 

Compounds [La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)12] (4) and [La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)2] (5), a 1D and 

a 3D structures, respectively, were successfully isolated as phase-pure compounds using 

both synthetic approaches MWAS and a bench procedure coined as one-pot method and 

their crystalline structures were solved by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Crystals of 

[La(H3pmd)(H2pmd)(H2O)] (6) and [La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)2] (7) (obtained using microwave 

irradiation and from the one-pot approach, respectively) were manually harvested from 

physical mixtures, ultimately allowing their full structural elucidation using also single-

crystal X-ray diffraction studies. Compound [La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)4] (8), also obtained 

in one-pot approach, could only be isolated as a microcrystalline powder and its crystal 

structure was determined instead by powder X-ray diffraction studies. 

It was found that mild synthetic conditions are the optimal conditions for both 

synthetic methods so to promote the formation of the low dimensional compound 4, 

whereas the use of a higher temperature favored the formation of the 3D network 5. In that 

sense, we may look to 4 as the kinetic compound while 5 seems to be the thermodynamic 

one. Investigations on the modification of the particle size and shape promoted by variation 

of the reaction temperature and time, revealed that 4 crystallizes preferentially as 

aggregates of needle-like crystals while 5 crystallizes as plate-like particles. Furthermore, 

we concluded that there is no direct relationship between the variations of those parameters 

and the final average particle size.

Compound 6 could only be isolated as a residual product in MWAS and, despite all 

the efforts, it was not possible to successfully isolate it as a phase-pure material. Likewise, 

the appearance of 7 and 8 (synthesized using the one-pot approach) was promoted by the 

use of high values of temperature (typically above 80 ºC). Compound 7 was favoured by 

the use of higher ligand-to-metal proportion and its formation at higher temperatures could 

be related with its 1:1.5 La:H4pmd stoichiometry in the reactive gel.  

 MWAS, as mentioned above, and the one-pot methodologies have considerable 

advantages over typical solvo(hydro)thermal synthesis. In terms of reaction time, and as an 

attempt to solve the typical problem of using long reaction periods in the latter case, we 

were able to drastically decrease the typical 3 days initially used to prepare compound 5 to 

just a single minute of reaction under microwave irradiation or, alternatively, to 10 minutes 

using the one-pot methodology. Noteworthy, this drastic reduction in the reaction time has 

a direct and huge influence in the total energy consumed to prepare the MOF compound. 

For instance, considering the above reaction periods and power input/output values 

associated with each of the three synthetic methods, we were able to estimate the energy 

consumption, which ranged from ca. 340 000 kJ (3 days of hydrothermal conditions), to 

ca. 18.0 kJ (for 1 min in MWAS) and to ca. 8.6 kJ (for 10 min in one-pot). Therefore, 

these two alternative synthetic approaches to the typical hydrothermal reaction allow, on 

one hand, to prove the phase diagram of one given system for other architectures and, on 

the other hand, may also be considered for a possible implementation of the synthesis of 

MOFs at an industrial scale as they are cost efficient.

1D-3D MOFs Based on (Benzene-1,3,5-triyltris(methylene))triphosphonic Acid 

141 
 

4.1. Initial Considerations 

 

This Chapter describes three families of MOFs with different dimensionalities 

(i.e., 1D, 2D and 3D) prepared from the self-assembly between a tripodal phosphonate-

based organic ligand and lanthanide metallic centers. The preparation of these materials 

was achieved by using both conventional hydrothermal synthesis and microwave-

assisted synthesis (MWAS). 

(Benzene-1,3,5-triyltris(methylene))triphosphonic acid (H6bmt, Scheme 2.5) 

also has some degree of more felxibility due to the presence of three pendant –CH2– 

moieties. Structural rigidity arises from the presence of the central benzene ring. 

Compared with the previously described H4pmd organic ligand, H6bmt has one more 

phosphonic acid group which provides it more coordinative sites and the possibility to 

isolate different multidimentional structures. The crystal structure of H6bmt was 

reported for the first time by Jaffrès and collaborators.1 Since then this organic molecule 

have been scarcely employed in either the synthesis of coordination-based complexes or 

in traditional crystal engineering approaches: i) in 2010 the group of Clearfield reported 

the preparation of a dimeric complex of Cu2+, formulated as [Cu2(H4bmt)2(4,4’-

bpy)(H2O)2], using H6bmt and 4,4’-bipyridine (4,4’-bpy) under solvothermal 

conditions;2 ii) one year later Yang et al. prepared the 3D open-framework 

[Cu3(bmt)(H2O)3.6]·H2O from a reactive mixture composed of H6bmt and CuCl2·2H2O 

in water;3 iii) more recently, Tang and collaborators reported eight new transition metal 

trisphosphonate complexes, one 2D layered structure, formulated as 

[Cu2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2][H2dpe][H2O]4, produced by using H6bmt and seven from the self-

assembly of its analogue (2,4,6-trimetylbenzene-1,3,5-triyltris(methylene))triphosphonic acid 

organic molecule.4 To the present data H6bmt was used with lanthanide cations only by 

the MOF research group working at the University of Aveiro.5-6 

It is described the preparation of three distinct families of multidimensional 

MOFs produced from the self-assembly of the tripodal H6bmt with non-radioactive 

lanthanide cations (all with the exception of Lu3+): 

i) 1D [Ln(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]·3H2O materials [where Ln
3+ = La3+ (9), 

(La0.97Eu0.03)
3+ (10) and (La0.97Tb0.03)

3+ (11)] isolated by hydrothermal MWAS;5 

ii) 2D layered [Ln2(H3bmt)2]·H2O materials [where Ln
3+ = Eu3+ (12), Gd3+ (13), 

Tb3+ (14), Dy3+ (15), Ho3+ (16), Er3+ (17), Tm3+ (18) and Yb3+ (19)] prepared 

under conventional hydrothermal conditions; 

iii) 3D [Ln2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]·H2O materials [where Ln
3+ = La3+ (20), Ce3+ (21), Pr3+ 

(22), Nd3+ (23), (La0.95Eu0.05)
3+ (24) and (La0.95Tb0.05)

3+ (25)] isolated under 

hydrothermal conditions and also by employing the MWAS approach.6 

The crystal structures of the isotypical families of the 1D and 3D compounds 

were unveiled by single-crystal X-ray, while the 2D materials, isolated as 

microcrystalline powders, were investigated using powder X-ray diffraction studies. All 



Chapter 4 

142 
 

materials were fully characterized by standard solid-state techniques (FT-IR, electron 

microscopy (SEM and EDS), solid-state NMR, thermogravimetric and elemental 

analysis). 

The catalytic behavior of the 9 and 20 was evaluated in the ring-opening reaction 

of styrene oxide with methanol. Both compounds showed excellent regioselectivity, 

recyclability and structural stability in consecutive catalytic runs. Nevertheless, the 

catalytic activity of 9 (conversion of 100% of styrene oxide in 30 min) is notably 

outstanding compared with that of compound 20 (conversion of 80% of styrene oxide in 

24 h). 

The photoluminescent properties of the 1D materials 10 and 11, and of the 3D 

materials 24 and 25 is described in detail. The Tb3+-based compounds 11 and 25 

showed to be highly efficient light converting materials exhibiting absolute emission 

quantum yields of 44 and 46%, respectively. Removing under vacuum all the water 

molecules (coordinated and of crystallization) from the crystalline structure of 24 

promotes a remarkable increase of the quantum efficiency from ca. 15 to 54%.  

 
 

4.2. Microwave-Assisted Synthesis of 1D Lanthanide-Organic         

Frameworks 

  

4.2.1. Microwave-Assisted Hydrothermal Synthesis 

 

Two different lanthanum-based materials, formulated as 

[La(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]·3H2O (9) and [La2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]·H2O (20), have been 

isolated while reacting the tripodal organic ligand H6bmt with lanthanum chloride 

under microwave irradiation (see sub-section 8.11.1.1 in the Experimental Section for 

further details). Compound 20 was firstly prepared under conventional hydrothermal 

conditions and further details are described in Section 4.4.  

Aiming at the preparation of new phase-pure materials (in this case 9 and 20), 

the reaction time and temperature in MWAS conditions were systematically varied 

(Figure 4.1). The 1D compound 9 is readily isolated at low temperatures, mainly at 40 

and 60 ºC. Increasing both the reaction time and temperature, compound 20 starts to 

prevail as the main product. The latter material is, however, obtained as phase-pure only 

at 150 ºC. Mixtures of both compounds are isolated at 90, 100, and 120 ºC, with 20 

dominating at higher reaction times (15 and 20 minutes). 

Crystal morphology of 9 and 20 was investigated using scanning electron 

microscopy (SEM): while 9 is composed of aggregates of particles with poorly defined 

morphology, 20 is instead composed of spherical aggregates with sizes in the range of 

tens of micrometers (Figure 4.2). The reaction temperature seems to have an important 

role in the crystal morphology and size of compound 9: at 40 ºC this compound is 

mostly composed of aggregates of small and irregular particles; increasing the 



1D-3D MOFs Based on (Benzene-1,3,5-triyltris(methylene))triphosphonic Acid 

143 
 

temperature for 60 and 90 ºC crystal growth is boosted, affording better-defined 

particles. Crystals of 20 begin to appear at 100 ºC (for periods of time of 5 minutes), 

becoming predominant at 120 ºC. In the 100-150 ºC temperature range changes in the 

crystal size and morphology of 20 are not easily discerned.

microwave irradiation at different temperatures for 5 minutes of reaction time.  



Chapter 4 

144 
 

 The preparation of optically-active materials with stoichiometric amounts of 

distinct lanthanides was performed using the optimal conditions discovered for 9 while 

including 3% of Eu3+ or Tb3+ in the reactive mixtures: [(La0.97Eu0.03)(H4bmt)(H5bmt)-

(H2O)2]·3H2O (10) and [(La0.97Tb0.03)(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]·3H2O (11) were obtained 

at 60 ºC using 5 minutes of irradiation. Phase purity of all materials and rare-earth 

distribution were unequivocally confirmed using several solid-state techniques, 

including powder X-ray diffraction (see Figure B.1.1 in the Appendices for further 

details). 

 

4.2.2. Crystal Structure of [La(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]·3H2O 

 

The crystal structure of 9 was unequivocally determined from single-crystal X-

ray diffraction studies at 100 K in the monoclinic centrosymmetric space group P21/m, 

with the asymmetric unit comprising a whole residue of H6bmt, half of a La
3+ metal 

centre, and five halves of crystallographically independent water molecules. The 

structure is made up by a single La3+ ion located on the crystallographic mirror plane, 

being coordinated to four symmetry-related organic ligands and two water molecules 

(which are also located on the mirror plane). The overall coordination environment, 

{LaO8}, resembles a slightly distorted square antiprism (Figure 4.3). The La–O 

distances are 2.665(5) and 2.713(5) Å for the coordinated water molecules and range 

between 2.406(3) to 2.488(3) Å for the connections to the four symmetry-equivalent 

organic ligands composing the coordination sphere. The quadrangular and triangular 

faces of the square antiprism show angles in the 77.80(15)-101.62(13)º and 42.04(7)-

74.96(10)º ranges, respectively. The phosphonic acid residues are all located on the 

same side of the medium plane defined by the carbon atoms of the organic ligand 

[largest deviation of 0.064(4) Å for C5].

In order to balance the metal charge the ligand loses an average number of 1.5 

protons. While the phosphonic residue centred in P1 is neutral, that centred in P3 is 

monodeprotonated. Two symmetry-related and adjacent O6 atoms (bonded to P2) share 

a single proton, giving an average half of a proton for each donor atom. 

All water molecules show half occupation, given their location on the mirror 

plane (O1W to O3W) or because of symmetry disorder due to the proximity to it (O4W 

and O5W). These molecules are involved in two types of hydrogen bond assemblies,

namely a one-dimensional array (Figure 4.5a) and a discrete chain (Figure 4.5b). The 

polymeric array runs across the mirror plane, parallel to the [100] direction of the unit 

cell. It comprises two rings (O2W···O6···O6 and O1W···O8···O3W···O8) and a 

discrete chain (O5···O4W···O5W···O9), with graph sets motifs R3

respectively.7 Alternatively, a polymeric chain with the graph set motif C7

observed by choosing a suitable path in the array (Figure 4.5a). In the independent 

discrete chain atoms O2, O3, O4 and O7 from adjacent phosphonic moieties are 

engaged in strong hydrogen bonds located inside the boundaries of the one-dimensional

4.2.3. Thermogravimetry and Thermodiffractometry 

 

The thermal stability of bulk [Ln(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]·3H2O materials [where 

Ln3+ = La3+ (9), (La0.97Eu0.03)
3+ (10) and (La0.97Tb0.03)

3+ (11)] was investigated between 

ambient temperature and ca. 800 ºC. Thermograms show a relatively similar thermal 

stability for all compounds (Figure B.1.2 in the Appendices). In order to evaluate the 

effect of increasing temperature in the crystal structure VTPXRD studies have been 

performed for 9 in the 30-500 ºC range (Figure 4.6 – top right). In the following 

paragraphs we shall focus the discussion on the thermal behavior of compound 9, being 

assumed that this behavior is similar for the remaining members of the isotypical series. 



Chapter 4 

148 
 

Between ambient temperature and ca. 184 ºC, two consecutive weight losses are 

markedly visible (Figure 4.6 – bottom left): three water molecules are released in the 

first step (ca. 5.9% weight loss; calculated ca. 5.7%), while the second step agrees well 

with the liberation of two of such moieties (ca. 3.5% weight loss; calculated ca. 3.8%). 

These results are in perfect agreement with the crystallographic studies which 

determined for the empirical formula of 9 the presence of three disordered water 

molecules housed within the small crystal channels, and two additional ones 

coordinated to the rare-earth cations. Moreover, the two markedly distinct environments 

for these moieties fully justify the temperature ranges in which they are released. 

Thermodiffractometry studies show that the structure of compound 9 remains 

unaltered up to ca. 60 ºC (Figure 4.6 – top right). Between this temperature and ca. 120 

ºC a new crystalline phase is obtained, most likely corresponding to the phase without 

the disordered lattice water molecules of crystallization (see above). The liberation of 

the coordinated water molecules induces a new sudden structural modification which 

prevails in the ca. 120-200 ºC temperature range. 

A third weight loss, corresponding to a total of ca. 5.1%, occurs between ca. 230 

and 350 ºC. According to our previous studies on lanthanide polyphosphonates,8 at this 

temperature range the organic ligand may begin to deteriorate leading to the formation 

of pyrophosphonates with the consequent release of water molecules (in this case the 

observed weight loss is equivalent to almost three water molecules). To prove this 

hypothesis, compound 9 was calcined at 350 ºC and the resulting residue was analyzed 

by FT-IR so to identify the typical ?(P?O?P) stretching vibration of pyrophosphonates, 

which normally appears in the 930-915 cm-1 range.9 The results were inconclusive due 

to the existence of other vibrational modes in this spectral region overlapping of the 

?(P?O?P) vibration. We note, however, that thermodiffractometry reveal two more 

phase transformations in the ca. 230-350 ºC temperature range, both leading to 

crystalline phases. 

After the formation of an amorphous residue at ca. 450 ºC, there is a markedly 

visible weight increase of ca. 1.5 % at around ca. 500 ºC, which can be attributed to an 

oxidation of the organic component, in particular the oxidation of the phosphonate P?C 

bond to a P?O moiety. This assumption is further supported by a direct comparison 

between the thermograms of compound 9 performed under air and nitrogen atmospheres 

(Figure B.1.3 in the Appendices): when using N2 there is no weight increase at ca. 500 

ºC. It is important to emphasize that up to this temperature (ca. 500 ºC) the thermal 

behaviour in air and nitrogen of compound 9 is almost identical, ultimately indicating 

that the thermal stability of the material, alongside with its phase transformations due to 

the release of water molecules and most likely the formation of the pyrophosphonates, 

is independent of the atmosphere. The presence (or absence) of an oxidative atmosphere 

only starts to be important when the organic ligand begins to decompose: indeed, in air 

the decomposition is much faster than in nitrogen as depicted in Figure B.1.3 (in the 

Appendices).

After the decomposition of the organic ligand, which occurs above ca. 700 ºC, 

powder X-ray diffraction studies (PDF4+ 2012 release ICDD database) showed that the 

residue was composed of lanthanum catenatriphosphate (LaP3O9, ICDD 00-033-0717), 

which further evolved (at ca. 900 ºC) to a mixture composed of LaP3O9 and monazite 

(LaPO4, ICDD 01-071-6745).

4.2.4. FT-IR Spectroscopic Studies 
  

The FT-IR spectra (Figure 4.7) of the isotypical 

[Ln(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]·3H2O materials [where Ln
3+ = La3+ (9), (La0.97Eu0.03)

3+ (10) 

and (La0.97Tb0.03)
3+ (11)] exhibit a number of bands which are diagnostic of the 

structural features of the materials. This subsection discusses only the spectral features 

of compound 9, being the conclusions also valid for 10 and 11.  

The material contains in its crystal structure several types of water molecules 

with very distinct crystallographic environment. This structural feature is markedly 



Chapter 4 

150 
 

visible in the FT-IR spectrum, particularly in the 3750-2100 cm-1 spectral range which 

is dominated by the O?H vibrational modes of water molecules. The two sharp bands of 

medium intensity located at ca. 3629 and 3546 cm-1 correspond to the ?(O?H) 

stretching vibrational modes of coordinated water molecules. The same features are 

observed for the lattice water molecules of crystallization with the occurrence of two 

weak broad bands centered at around 3338 and 3225 cm-1. These assignments were 

unequivocally confirmed from analyses on the dehydrated material: after thermal 

treatment at ca. 190 ºC (data not shown) the broad bands associated with the lattice 

water molecules of crystallization completely disappear, and those of the coordinated 

moieties (sharp bands) are almost extinguished (please note: according to the 

thermogravimetric studies at this temperature the release of all water molecules may not 

be complete; this data is in good agreement with the performed thermogravimetric 

studies).

The presence of two bands for each type of water molecule agrees well with the 

crystallographic studies that show that there are two levels of strength for the hydrogen 

bonding interactions involving such moieties: for example, for the coordinated O1W 

and O2W water molecules it is possible to see that the latter is engaged in stronger 

interactions than the former based solely on the inter-nuclear distances between donor 

and acceptor (Table 4.1); regarding the water molecules of crystallization (O3W, O4W 

and O5W), the hydrogen bonding network is composed of strong connections 

(internuclear distances ranging from ca. 2.55 to 2.75 Å) and weaker interactions 

(distances in the ca. 2.96-3.16 Å – see Table 4.1). As a consequence, the O?H bonds for 

these molecules have overall two levels of strength that are ultimately reflected into 

different bands in the FT-IR spectrum. In this wide spectral region the typical ?(O?H) 

and ?(C?H) stretching vibrational modes of PO?H and ?CH2? are also found: between 

ca. 3085 and 2715 cm-1 for both groups, and at around 2437 cm-1 for PO?H in which 

the hydrogen atom is probably involved in hydrogen-bonding interactions. 

Below ca. 1750 cm-1 the FT-IR spectrum of 9 is complex with a large number of 

medium-to-very strong vibration bands arising from the organic ligand. Based in the 

literature,9 at ca. 1648 cm-1 one observes the in-plane deformation of water molecules, 

followed of the medium intensity band at ca. 1606 cm-1 attributed to the typical 

?(?C=C?) stretching vibrations of the aromatic ring. At ca. 1459, 1412 and 1407 cm-1 

the ?CH2? deformation vibrational modes from the P?CH2 groups are visible. 

Additionally, two sets of vibration bands in the 1350-1150 cm-1 and 1025-915 cm-1 

ranges include the ?(P=O) and ?(P?O) modes, respectively. The ?(P?C) stretching 

vibrational modes are found at ca. 753 and 718 cm-1. 

 

4.2.5. Solid-State NMR: [La(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]·3H2O 

 

In order to get a better insight into the phase purity and composition of the 

asymmetric unit, solid-state NMR studies have been performed on the diamagnetic 

[La(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]·3H2O (9) material. The 
31P MAS spectrum of 9 shows, in 

the isotropic region, three well-resolved sharp resonances centered at ca. 17.0, 22.1 and 

26.7 ppm (Figure 4.8). This information agrees well with the presence of three 

crystallographically distinct phosphorus sites. Peak deconvolution and integration, 

including the spinning sidebands, provides a ratio of ca. 1.00 : 0.92 : 0.94 for each 

resonance, respectively. 

The 13C{1H} CP MAS spectrum (Figure B.1.4 in the Appendices) is composed 

of two distinct spectral regions. The ca. 20-45 ppm range comprises two resonances at 

ca. 32.5 (shoulder) and 34.2 ppm, attributed to the –CH2? groups of the organic ligand. 

In the 120-140 ppm spectral region the resonances of the aromatic carbon atoms appear 

peaking at ca. 128.3, 128.9, 132.1 and 133.7 ppm. In summary, data from the 31P MAS 

spectrum is unequivocal strongly indicating the presence in the asymmetric unit of only 

one organic molecule, in good agreement with the crystallographic studies.

peaking at ca. 17.0, 22.1 and 26.7 ppm, respectively.

(240-288 nm) attributed to ?-?* transitions. In the emission spectra of 10 and 11 

recorded at ambient temperature (excited at 276 nm; Figure 4.10) the sharp lines are 

assigned to transitions between the first excited non-degenerate 5D0 state and the 
7F0-4 

levels of the fundamental Eu3+ septet and to the first excited state 5D4 and the 
7F6-0 levels 

of Tb3+, respectively for 10 and 11. The local-field splitting of the Eu3+ 7F1,2
 levels into 

three and clearly less than five Stark components, respectively, and the predominance of 

the 5D0?
7F2 transition relatively to the 

5D0?
7F1 (Figure 4.10), indicates the presence of 

a single low-symmetry Eu3+ environment in the structure, as supported by the crystal 

structure determination.

The ambient temperature 5D0 and

were determined by monitoring the emission decay curves within the maximum of the 
5D0?

7F2 and 
5D4?

7F5 transitions, using an excitation at 393 and 376 nm, respectively 

(Figure 4.11). Decay curves were fitted by single exponential functions, with lifetimes 

of 0.37±0.01 and 1.52±0.01 ms for 10 and 11, respectively.

temperature, while monitoring the emission at 614 and 543.5 nm, respectively, and 
fitted with single exponential decay functions. The excitation was performed at 393 
and 376 nm, respectively. 

 

 

Based on the emission spectra, 5D0 lifetimes and empirical radiative and non-

radiative transition rates, assuming that only non-radiative and radiative processes are 

involved in the depopulation of the 5D0 state, the 
5D0 quantum efficiency, q,

10-14 has 

been determined for 10. The number of water molecules (nw) coordinated to Eu
3+ and 

Tb3+ may be determined using the empirical formulae of Horrocks and Kimura, 

respectively.15-16 Data for 10 and 11, including the absolute emission quantum yield (?, 

measured experimentally), are collected in Table 4.2. 

Compound 10 has a relative low quantum efficiency (8%). The measured 

absolute emission quantum yield reaches a maximum of 5% at 393 nm. In contrast, 

compound 11 reaches a relative high absolute emission quantum yield of 44% at 276 

nm excitation. The high absolute emission quantum yield reached for the Tb3+ emission 

is presumably due to a good superposition between the interconfigurational 4f75d1 

excited states of Tb3+, namely the high spin states commonly positioned at around 280 

nm, with the emitting S1?S0 transition of the ligand (zero-phonon level at ca. 277 nm.

4.2.7. Heterogeneous catalysis 
 

The catalytic performance of [La(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]·3H2O (9) was explored 

in the methanolysis of styrene oxide (PhEtO) (see Scheme 3.1 in Chapter 3). The 

catalytic reaction at 55 ºC gave 2-methoxy-2-phenylethanol (MeOPhEtOH) in 

quantitative yield within 30 min reaction (Table 4.3), while without a catalyst no 

reaction occurred. The catalytic stability of 9 was investigated by reusing the washed-

dried catalyst: slightly decrease in the PhEtO conversion and MeOPhEtOH yield at 30 

min reaction were observed for four consecutive batch runs. These differences are less 

pronounced when comparing the results for 1h reaction (Figure 4.12).

conditions: 0.4 M PhEtO, 20 g(9) L

-1, 1 h, 55 ºC, 800 rpm. 
 

 

The structural and morphological features of 9 after each catalytic batch run 

were studied by PXRD and electron microscopy (Figure 4.13). Despite a decrease in the 

crystal size of catalyst 9 recovered after first catalytic run (maintaining in the 

subsequent batch runs), the structure of 9 was preserved without visible modifications. 

The morphological changes may lead to the observed slight catalyst deactivation, 

possibly due to the destruction of some active sites. Nevertheless, the catalytic 

performance of 9 in recycling runs was fairly good without catalyst regeneration steps. 

A six-fold decrease in the catalyst bulk density (from 20 to 3.3 g L-1) led to 

comparably outstanding catalytic results: 95%/100% MeOPhEtOH at 30 min/1 h 

reaction, 55 ºC (Table 4.2). Furthermore, at approximately ambient temperature (35 ºC) 

and using a catalyst bulk density of 20 g(9) L
-1, quantitative MeOPhEtOH yield was 

reached at 1 h reaction. Decreasing the catalyst bulk density from 20 to 3.3 g(9) L
-1 at 35 

ºC resulted in a slower reaction; nevertheless, after 6 h reaction, 100% MeOPhEtOH 

yield was reached (Table 4.2). The leaching tests for 9 (fresh) and for the catalyst 

recovered after a 6 h-batch run at 35 ºC led to&amp;lt;2% conversion which is minor 

compared to that observed  in the presence of 9 (100% conversion, Table 4.3) indicating 

that the catalytic reaction is heterogeneous in nature. 

In order to get insights into the type of active sites responsible for the catalytic 

activity of 9, the reaction of PhEtO was carried out in the presence of catalytic amounts 

of the corresponding ligand and lanthanide precursors, namely H6bmt and LaCl3·7H2O 

(used in equivalent amounts to those corresponding to 3.3 g(9) L
-1). The reaction of 

PhEtO was very sluggish in the presence of LaCl3·7H2O (4% conversion at 3 h reaction,

35 ºC). In contrast, the H6bmt ligand precursor led to 100% MeOPhEtOH yield at 1 h 

reaction. These results suggest that Brönsted acidity renders the epoxide more 

susceptible to nucleophilic attack by the alcohol than Lewis acidity, leading to faster 

alcoholysis of the epoxide.

4.3. Hydrothermal Synthesis of Layered 2D Lanthanide-

Organic Frameworks 

 

4.3.1. Hydrothermal Synthesis 

 

The transformation of mixtures composed of H6bmt with the respective 

lanthanide chloride salts under hydrothermal conditions led to the isolation of a new 

family of layered 2D Lanthanide-Organic Frameworks, formulated as 

[Ln2(H3bmt)2]·H2O [where Ln
3+ = Eu3+ (12), Gd3+ (13), Tb3+ (14), Dy3+ (15), Ho3+ (16), 

Er3+ (17), Tm3+ (18) and Yb3+ (19)] (see sub-section 8.11.2.1 in the Experimental 

Section for further details on the synthesis).  

Because the 2D [Ln2(H3bmt)2]·H2O materials are solely composed of 

microcrystalline powders, phase identification and crystal solution were performed from 

Rietveld refinement studies using laboratory powder X-ray diffraction data. Figure 4.14 

shows the final Rietveld plot of the [Eu2(H3bmt)2]·H2O (12) material.

Rietveld studies of the bulk 12 material are only preliminary at this stage. A 

more unequivocal and detailed study is in progress using high-resolution synchrotron 

data collected both at ID31 (ESRF, Grenoble, France) and at I11 (DLS, Oxford, United 

Kingdom). The remaining materials belonging to the [Ln2(H3bmt)2]·H2O series were 

characterized by PXRD which allowed to confirm the structural similarities between all 

compounds (Figure 4.15). The inclusion of different lanthanide centers affects, 

nevertheless, the collected PXRD patterns: going from Eu3+ to Yb3+ there is an average 

increase of the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peaks. This 

behavior is characteristic of materials with decreasing size of the crystallites (Figure 

4.15).

SEM studies performed on the bulk [Ln2(H3bmt)2]·H2O materials so to analyze 

crystal morphology further support the aforementioned assumption (Figure 4.16). 

Despite the morphological differences between the compounds, it is noteworthy a clear 

decrease in the average particle size of the compounds. Indeed, compounds containing 

in their structure lanthanide centers with lower atomic number (i.e., larger ionic radius), 

as for instance Eu3+ and Gd3+, are composed of larger particles. Using Yb3+, the last 

element of the lanthanide series, as the metal center a isotypical material is obtained but, 

in this case, formed of much smaller crystallites. Because the reaction conditions to 

prepare all [Ln2(H3bmt)2]·H2O materials were identical (see sub-section 8.10.2.1 in the 

of the Experimental Section for further details), these results clearly suggest that the 

decrease of the average particle size is due to the decrease of the ionic radius of the 

employed lanthanide center.

4.3.2. Crystal Structure Description of [Eu2(H3pmt)2]·H2O 

 

Preliminary powder X-ray diffraction studies provide insight on the cystal 

structure of the novel 2D [Eu2(H3bmt)2]·H2O (12) material. Compound 12 crystallizes in 

the monoclinic P21/n space group, with the asymmetric unit comprising a single Eu
3+ 

metallic center, one H3bmt
3- bridging organic linker and half of one water molecule of 

crystallization. The coordination sphere of Eu3+ center is composed of six phosphonate 

groups describing a distorted octahedral coordination geometry as depicted in Figure 

4.17. The metallic center is, thus, coordinated to a total of six oxygen atoms, {EuO6}, 

all connected to the metallic center by way of a syn-bridging coordination mode. 

Compound 12 contains a two-dimensional ?
2[Eu2(H3bmt)2] network placed on the 

ab plane of the unit cell (Figure 4.18a). Hydrogen bonding between individual 

?
2[Eu2(H3bmt)2] layers leads to the formation of a compact structure as described in 

Figure 4.18b.

4.3.3. Thermogravimetry and Thermodiffractometry 

 

The thermal stability of the 2D layered [Ln2(H3bmt)2]·H2O materials [where 

Ln3+ = Eu3+ (12), Gd3+ (13), Tb3+ (14), Dy3+ (15), Ho3+ (16), Er3+ (17), Tm3+ (18) and 

Yb3+ (19)] were studied from ambient temperature to 800 ºC. Thermograms show 

slightly different weight loss profiles for each materials (Figure B.2.1 in the 

Appendices). The decomposition pathways observed for compounds that have 

lanthanide centers with higher atomic numbers (as for instance Yb3+) are less defined 

than those for compounds possessing lanthanides with lower atomic numbers. This fact 

may be attributed to the decrease of the particle size: as mentioned in section 4.3.1 



Chapter 4 

162 
 

(supported by the SEM images) the Yb3+ material is mainly composed of nanoparticles. 

As a consequence, the overall thermal stability of these compounds is lower, leading to 

thermal decompositions also at lower temperatures. Nevertheless, despite these 

differences, the thermal decomposition of all materials occurs in the same general way. 

In order to evaluate the effect of increasing temperature in the crystal structure 

VTPXRD studies have been performed for 12 in the 30-510 ºC range (Figure 4.19 – 

right). The discussion is solely focused on the thermal behavior of compound 12, being 

assumed that this behavior is similar for the remaining members of the isotypical series. 

VTPXRD patterns show that compound 12 is thermally robust up to ca. 370 ºC. 

From the thermogram of 12 (Figure 4.19 – left), the first weight loss occurs in the ca. 

163-255 ºC range corresponding to the release of the water molecules of crystallization: 

noteworthy, the observed weight loss of 1.3% is slightly lower than the expected one 

(1.7%). At higher temperature there is a second decomposition of 4.9%. The various 

protonated P-OH moieties may be at the genesis of a dehydration process that occurs 

from ca. 255 to 532 ºC leading to this additional loss of water. Indeed, VTPXRD studies 

show a significant modification in the structure (mainly, loss of crystallinity) of 12 

within this temperature range. The structure of compound 12 starts to decompose above 

this temperature.

4.3.4. FT-IR Spectroscopic Studies 

 

FT-IR spectra of the 2D [Ln2(H3bmt)2]·H2O materials [where Ln
3+ = Eu3+ (12), 

Gd3+ (13), Tb3+ (14), Dy3+ (15), Ho3+ (16), Er3+ (17), Tm3+ (18) and Yb3+ (19)] were 

collected so to further investigate some structural details previously described (Figure 

4.20 and Figure B.2.2 in the Appendices). Figure 4.20 depicts selected spectral regions 

emphasizing a number of vibrational bands of the most structurally-relevant functional 



1D-3D MOFs Based on (Benzene-1,3,5-triyltris(methylene))triphosphonic Acid 

163 
 

groups present in 12. Due to the very similar spectral profiles, only compound 12 will 

be described with more detail in the following paragraphs, being the conclusions also 

valid for the remaining materials. 

The FT-IR spectrum of 12 is dominated by two spectral regions. In the ca. 3750-

2500 cm-1 range it is possible to observe the typical ?(POH) vibrational mode of strong 

intensity centered at ca. 3607 cm-1. At ca. 3397 cm-1 the ?(O?H) stretching vibrations of 

the water molecules of crystallization and a broad band in the ca. 3328-2865 cm-1 

spectral range belonging to the ?(POH) and ?(C?H) stretching vibrations of the ?CH2? 

groups also appear in this region. 

Below 1800 cm-1 the FT-IR spectrum of 12 is complex with a large number of 

weak-to-very strong bands.9 At ca. 1615 and 1605 cm-1 the typical ?(H2O) and 

?(?C=C?) in-plane deformations are markedly visible. Two bands of medium intensity 

peaking at ca. 1460 and 1410 cm-1 are attributed to the ?CH2? deformation vibrational 

modes from the P?CH2 groups. Additionally, three vibrational bands are also visible in 

the FT-IR spectrum: i) the ?(P=O) appear in the 1176-1035 cm-1 range; ii) the ?(P?O) 

mode is identified at ca. 931 cm-1 as a vibration band with very strong intensity; iii) the 

?(P?C) stretching vibrational modes appear as weak bands centered at ca. 771 and 756 

cm-1.

4.4. Conventional Hydrothermal Synthesis of 3D Lanthanide- 

       Organic Frameworks 

  

 

4.4.1. Hydrothermal Synthesis 

 

The reaction between the tripodal organic ligand H6bmt and lanthanide (III) 

chloride hydrates afforded [Ln2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]·H2O materials as large single crystals 

[where Ln3+ = La3+ (20), Ce3+ (21), Pr3+ (22), Nd3+ (23), (La0.95Eu0.05)
3+ (24) and 

(La0.95Tb0.05)
3+ (25)]. Synthesis occurred under typical hydrothermal conditions at a 

temperature of 180 ºC, under autogeneous pressure, over a period of 3 days (see sub-

section 8.11.3.1 in the Experimental Section for further details). The structural features 

of these materials could, therefore, be readily unveiled using single-crystal X-ray 

diffraction studies as described in the following subsection. Independently of the 

lanthanide (or mixture of lanthanides for the optically-active materials 24 and 25), these 

conditions were highly reproducible, systematically yielding crystalline products of the 

desired phases. Phase purity and homogeneity of the bulk samples 20 to 25 have been 

confirmed also by PXRD (Figure 4.21).

3+ (25)].

Aiming to investigate if milder conditions could be employed, the preparation of 

20 was further tested at 100 ºC for reactions times ranging from 1 to 3 days, also under 

conventional hydrothermal conditions. Results suggest that the desired pure-phase could 

be readily isolated under all the tested conditions as large single crystals (Figure 4.22). 

Additionally, and as described in the sub-section 4.2.1, MWAS also proved to be an 

excellent alternative to prepare 20 with large particles. This method brings the 

additional advantage of drastically reducing the preparation time from 1 day to only 5 

minutes.

[La2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]·H2O (20) material prepared at mild temperatures (100 ºC) and

Optically-active materials containing Eu3+ and Tb3+ embedded into La3+ 

matrices, were isolated as bulk microcrystalline materials by including in the reactive 

gels 5% of Eu3+ or Tb3+ salts (in mol; see sub-section 8.11.3.1 in the Experimental 



Chapter 4 

166 
 

Section for details). We note that this methodology of preparing optically-active 

materials permits, on the one hand, to guarantee that the framework structure is not 

altered due to the known lanthanide contraction effect and, on the other, that Eu3+ and 

Tb3+ cations are statistically diluted in the networks so to prevent self-quenching effects. 

 

4.4.2. Crystal Structure of [La2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]·H2O 

 

Large single-crystals of [Ln2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]·H2O materials [where Ln
3+ = La3+ 

(20), Ce3+ (21), Pr3+ (22), Nd3+ (23)] were directly harvested from the reaction vessels 

and their crystal structure determined in the centrosymmetric monoclinic C2/c space 

group using single-crystal X-ray diffraction (see sub-section 8.11.3.1 in the 

Experimental Section for further details). The crystal structure of the dehydrated 

material of 20 ([La(H3bmt)], 20-dehyd) was also unequivocally unveiled from single-

crystal X-ray diffraction. The structural details in the following paragraphs will be, 

therefore, solely based on the La3+ materials (as-prepared and dehydrated), and are 

assumed to be valid for the remaining members of the series. 

The asymmetric units of 20 and 20-dehyd are composed of a single 

crystallographically independent La3+ centre and one entire molecular unit of the 

deprotonated H3bmt
3- organic linker. These crystallographic details are in good 

agreement with the structural features derived from both the solid-state NMR studies 

and the detailed photoluminescence investigations (see following bub-sections). In 20, 

the La3+ center is eight-coordinated, {LaO8}, to a total of six phosphonate groups (from 

six symmetry-related H3bmt
3- anionic ligands) and one disordered water molecule (over 

two distinct locations - O1W and O2W - with 50% of rate of occupancy for each), with 

the overall coordination polyhedron resembling a highly distorted capped pentagonal 

bipyramid. The removal of the coordinated water molecule to yield 20-dehyd (by 

heating above 100 ºC with or without high vacuum), leads to a seven-coordination 

environment, {LaO7}, with the overall geometry now resembling a simple distorted 

pentagonal bipyramid (the capping position was occupied by the solvent molecule - see 

Figures 4.23a and 4.23b).  

This seamless transformation is concomitantly accompanied by only small 

adjustments in the geometrical parameters of the coordination polyhedra, as clearly 

registered by the tabulated La–O distances and O–La–O angles given in Tables B.3.1 

and B.3.2, respectively, in the Appendices. These small modifications are attributed to 

the intrinsic need to accommodate the extra coordinative position left vacant by the 

liberation of the coordinated solvent molecule. The La–O bond lengths are, therefore, 

found in the 2.3365(18)-2.6908(17) Å and 2.3293(14)-2.6459(12) Å ranges for 20 and 

20-dehyd, respectively. As expected, the reduction in the coordination number of La3+ 

also leads to a reduction of all bond lengths. It is further noted that the longest La–O 

bond lengths registered for both structures [2.6908(17) and 2.6029(16) Å for 20; 

2.6459(12) and 2.6012(12) Å for 20-dehyd - see Table B.3.1 in the Appendices] are 

directly associated with the P2 phosphonate group which has a pivotal role in the 



1D-3D MOFs Based on (Benzene-1,3,5-triyltris(methylene))triphosphonic Acid 

167 
 

structure architectures: besides being the sole phosphonate group which is O,O-chelated 

to La3+ (bite angles of 55.44(5) and 55.80(4)º for 20 and 20-dehyd, respectively; see 

Figures 4.23a and 4.23b), it further establishes physical connections between three 

adjacent metallic centres, leading to the formation of a one-dimensional zigzag 

lanthanum oxide chain running parallel to the [010] direction of the unit cell, assembled 

from edge-sharing of {LaO8} or {LaO7} polyhedra (Figures  4.23c, 4.23d and 4.24).

how the release of the coordinated water molecules in 20 affects the hydrogen 
bonding network present in the crystal structures and the inter-lanthanide distance 
across the zigzag chains. 

 

 

The typical zeolitic-type behaviour observed for the [Ln2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]·H2O 

materials concerning the water molecules can be rationalized taking solely into 

consideration the structural features of the networks. Both the coordinated and 

crystallization water molecules are located in hydrophilic cavities in the structure, 

distributed in a parallel fashion to the aforementioned lanthanum oxide chains which, 

under high temperatures or high vacuum, constitute an effective escape route for the 

solvent molecules (Figures 4.23c, 4.23d and 4.23e). This process motivates a structural 

modification of the lanthanum oxide chains. On the one hand, the observed intermetallic 



1D-3D MOFs Based on (Benzene-1,3,5-triyltris(methylene))triphosphonic Acid 

169 
 

La···La distance is reduced by ca. 3% from 4.1984(2) Å to 4.0864(6) Å. On the other 

hand, the absence of the water molecules (coordinated and in the cavities), which are 

engaged in O–H···O hydrogen bonds with the neighbouring P1 phosphonate group 

(Table B.3.3), induces a modification of the hydrogen bonding network: the P1–O2–H2 

moiety becomes free to rotate and establish a new interaction with the neighbouring 

O,O-chelated P2 phosphonate group (Figure 4.24). 

 

4.4.3. Thermogravimetry and Thermodiffractometry 

 

Bulk [Ln2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]·H2O materials [where Ln
3+ = La3+ (20), Ce3+ (21), 

Pr3+ (22), Nd3+ (23), (La0.95Eu0.05)
3+ (24) and (La0.95Tb0.05)

3+ (25)] exhibit similar 

thermal stabilities with increasing temperature (thermogram for 20 given in Figure 4.25; 

thermograms for 21-25 are provided in Figure B.3.1 in the Appendices). In order to 

fully understand the structural modifications of the materials with temperature, 

thermodiffractometry between ambient temperature and ca. 600 ºC was performed for 

[La2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]·H2O (20) (Figure 4.25). We note that the results and conclusions 

described in the following paragraphs have only been experimentally derived for the 

La3+-based material (20). It is, however, feasible to assume that all members of this 

series should behave in a very similar fashion as, for example, concluded from the 

photoluminescent studies on the mixed-lanthanide materials.  

Between ambient temperature and ca. 265 ºC, 20 releases a total of 4.9% of its 

weight in a clear two-step fashion (peaks at 69 and 162 ºC). This loss agrees well with 

the release of the total amount of water molecules described by the empirical formula 

(for 3 water molecules a theoretical weight loss of ca. 5.2% is estimated). As found 

from the crystallographic studies (see above), the structures house a total of one 

disordered water molecule which is readily released in a very early stage: between 

ambient temperature and ca. 130 ºC there is a continuous weight loss of 1.4% 

corresponding to the liberation of the solvent of crystallization (calculated of ca. 1.7%). 

From the thermodiffractometry studies one notes that this release induces very small 

modifications in the crystal structure. The second stage of solvent liberation 

corresponds to those that are coordinated to the La3+ centers (see structural details 

below), occurring between ca. 130 and 265 ºC (weigh loss observed 3.5%, calculated 

3.4%): above ca. 130 ºC the PXRD patterns clearly show a progressive structural 

modification of the material up to the in situ formation of the completely dehydrated 

form, [La(H3bmt)] (20-dehyd). This framework remains structurally stable over a 

temperature window of about 150 ºC. At ca. 420 ºC thermal decomposition (most 

probably due to oxidation of the organic component) settles in, leading to the formation 

of an amorphous residue (Figure 4.25). 

It is worth noting that the complete dehydration of 20 could be achieved by 

either increasing the temperature (as described above), or by placing the material under 

a high vacuum (as ascertained from the photoluminescence studies for the mixed-

lanthanide material with Eu3+ - see subsection 4.4.5). The completely dehydrated 



Chapter 4 

170 
 

materials could readily revert to their original form with exposure to air. We note that 

this typical zeolitic behaviour was tested in situ for a number of cycles with little, or no 

loss, of overall crystallinity. This structural robustness was of crucial importance to 

isolate the completely dehydrated material and unveil its crystal structure from single-

crystal X-ray diffraction studies (see above).

diffraction study of [La2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]·H2O (20). 

 

 

4.4.4. Solid-State NMR and FT-IR Spectroscopy Studies 

 

The 31P MAS spectrum of 20 shows the presence of three well-resolved isotropic 

resonances peaking at 15.3, 19.7 and 23.4 ppm (Figure 4.26). In addition, peak 

deconvolution and integration including the spinning sidebands yields a ratio of ca. 

1.00 : 1.04 : 1.01 for these resonances. The 13C{1H} CP MAS spectrum (Figure B.3.2 in 

the Appendices) clearly shows two distinct spectral regions: the 29-41 ppm spectral 

range (peaks at: 35.4 ppm and 36.8 ppm - shoulder) is attributed to the –CH2– groups, 

with its deficiency of spectral resolution being simultaneously attributed to very similar 

chemical environments (for the three expected groups) and to the likely existence of 

spin multiplets arising from 1JC,P coupling (usually in the 5-90 Hz range);
17 the aromatic 

carbon atoms from the ring appear in the 124-139 ppm window (peaks at: 129.4, 130.1, 

133.1 and 135.7 ppm). This bulk technique clearly supports the existence of a single 

crystallographically unique H3bmt
3- organic PBU in the asymmetric unit. Additionally, 



1D-3D MOFs Based on (Benzene-1,3,5-triyltris(methylene))triphosphonic Acid 

171 
 

and based on the performed photoluminescence studies (see dedicated section below), 

the material should also contain a single independent lanthanide center. These results 

are in perfect agreement with the performed crystallographic studies, also indicating 

phase purity and homogeneity. 

 

 

Figure 4.26 - 31P HPDEC MAS spectrum of [La2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]·H2O (20). 
Spinning sidebands are depicted by an asterisk. Peak deconvolution and integration 
throughout the entire spectral range (i.e., including the spinning sidebands) gives a 
ratio of ca. 1.00 : 1.04 : 1.01 for the isotropic resonances at ca. 15.3, 19.7 and 23.4 
ppm, respectively, which is in perfect agreement with the crystal structure 
determination of the same material. 

 

 

As also ascertained by PXRD studies, vibrational FT-IR spectroscopy studies 

clearly support that bulk materials 20 to 25 are indeed isotypical (see Figure 4.27 for 

compound 20 and Figure B.3.3 in the Appendices for the remaining compounds 21-25). 

Figure 4.27 shows the two most relevant regions of the spectra providing temptative 

assignments for the most diagnostic vibrational bands of compound 20. Those present in 

the 3750-2500 cm-1 region arise mainly from stretching vibrations of O–H groups (from 

water molecules, both coordinated and of crystallization, and the PO–H groups) and –

CH2– groups. Between 350 and 1700 cm
-1 the spectra are significantly more complex 

being dominated by the vibrational modes associated with coordinated phosphonate 

groups, aromatic ring vibrations and the in-plane deformation of water molecules 

(peaking around ca. 1600 cm-1).9

4.4.5. Photoluminescence 

 

The inclusion of optically-active lanthanide centers (such as Eu3+ and Tb3+) into 

the La3+ matrix of compound 20 leads to the formation of new materials capable of 

converting UV radiation into visible light at ambient temperature as depicted in Figure 

4.28 for [(La0.95Eu0.05)2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]·H2O (24) and [(La0.95Tb0.05)2(H3bmt)2]·H2O 

(25). The excitation and emission spectra, and the 5D4 decay curves of 25 and its 

dehydrated form, [(La0.95Tb0.05)(H3bmt)] (25-dehyd), are provided in Figure B.3.4 in 

the Appendices. The following paragraphs focus the discussion only on the Eu3+-

containing compounds. It is also briefly discussed the photoluminescence properties of 

compound [La2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]·H2O (24), which are characteristic of its organic PBUs

The excitation spectra of [(La0.95Eu0.05)2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]·H2O (24) was recorded 

at 298 and 11 K while monitoring within the Eu3+ 5D0?
7F2 transition (Figure 4.29a). 

Both spectra are dominated by two broad UV bands (240-288 and 288-340 nm) which 

may be attributed to ?-?* transitions of the organic PBUs. This attribution was

3+ intra-4f6 transitions. A similar band 

assignment of the excitation spectra can be performed for the fully dehydrated form of 

24, [(La0.95Eu0.05)(H3bmt)] (24-dehyd) (Figure 4.29b), prepared in situ from the 

dehydration of 24 at ca. 450 K and under a high vacuum (ca. 5×10-6 mbar). For this 

latter material the intensity of the UV broad bands are significantly more distinct and 

the Eu3+ intra-4f6 transitions are more noticeable, in particular the 7F0?
5D0 transition 

which is almost absent in 24. 

The emission spectra of 24 and 24-dehyd recorded at 298 and 11 K (excited at 

393 nm) are provided in Figures 4.30a and 4.30b, respectively. The sharp lines are 

assigned to transitions between the first excited non-degenerate 5D0 state and the 
7F0-4 

levels of the fundamental Eu3+ septet. Except for 5D0?
7F1, which has a predominant 

magnetic-dipole character independent of the Eu3+ crystal site, the observed transitions 

are mainly of electric-dipole nature. The presence of one single line for the 5D0?
7F0 

transition and the local-field splitting of the 7F1,2
 levels into three and a maximum of 

five Stark components, respectively, and the predominance of the 5D0?
7F2 transition 

relatively to the 5D0?
7F1, indicates the presence of a single low-symmetry Eu

3+ 

environment without inversion symmetry in both structures, as supported by the crystal 

structure determination (see dedicated section for details). Eu3+ emission is highly 

sensitive to small modifications on the first coordination sphere of the metal, such as the 

variation of the number and type of coordinated moieties. Thus, the reversible 

transformation of 24 into 24-dehyd, due to the release and subsequent absorption of 

water molecules, can easily be accompanied by photoluminescence (Figures 4.30c and 

4.30d). Under the employed experimental conditions (high vacuum), the structural 

change on the first coordination sphere of Eu3+ starts at ca. 350 K and is nearly 

complete at 400 K (Figure 4.30c). The starting form can be regenerated with subsequent 

exposure of the dehydrated material to air under normal ambient conditions (Figure 

4.30d). We note that these temperatures are slightly distinct, but still very comparable, 

to those observed both in the TGA measurements and in the thermodiffractometry 

studies (see sub-section 4.4.3). We attribute the small differences to the fact that the 

photoluminescence studies have been performed under vacuum, which greatly 

facilitates the release of all water molecules.

, known as the asymmetric ratio, was calculated at ca. 2.5 and 4.0 for 

24 and 24-dehyd, respectively. These values point to a slightly more distorted 

environment of the Eu3+ coordination polyhedron in the dehydrated material (please 

note: a low value indicates a lower distortion of local environment for Eu3+, 

approaching to the ideal case of an inversion center). This result agrees well with the 

crystallographic studies: while the release of the coordinated water molecule does not

imply a considerable rearrangement of the coordination polyhedron of Eu3+, it 

nevertheless leads to a more asymmetric environment as the bond angles to the apical 

positions of the pentagonal bipyramid become larger than those between the 

equatorially-connected atoms. 

The ambient temperature (298 K) 5D0 lifetime of Eu
3+ of 24 and 24-dehyd were 

determined by monitoring the emission decay curves within the maximum of the 
5D0?

7F2 transition, using an excitation at ca. 393 nm (Figure 4.31). The decay curves 

were fitted by single exponential functions, yielding lifetimes of 0.60±0.01 and 

1.60±0.01 ms for 24 and 24-dehyd, respectively. This indicates the presence of a unique 

Eu3+ crystallographic site and clearly demonstrates the improvement of the decay time 

(ca. 2.7 times) with the removal of the coordinated water molecules due to the 

suppression of emission quenching through the coupling of the Eu3+ excited states with 

the vibrational states of the O–H oscillators.

and [(La0.95Eu0.05)(H3bmt)] (24-dehyd) (red), acquired at 298 K while monitoring 
the emission at 611.5 and 612.1 nm, respectively. Curves were fitted by using 
single exponential decay functions. The excitation was performed at 393 nm. 

 

 

Compounds 25 and 25-dehyd have similar excitation spectra at ambient 

temperature (298 K), being dominated by the broad UV band ranging from 240 to 288 

nm and attributed to the ligand excited states (Figure B.3.4 in the Appendices). The 

Tb3+ intra-4f8 transitions can be readily visualized after a magnification of the spectra. 

The enhancement of the broad UV band on the Tb3+-containing compounds when 

compared with the Eu3+-based materials may be explained by a more efficient energy 

transfer from the ligands to the Tb3+ cations, promoted by the superposition with the 

interconfigurational 4f75d1 excited states of Tb3+ in this region of the spectrum.18 The

impact of the dehydration process of 25 into 25-dehyd has also been studied: although 

in a smaller magnitude with respect to measurable effects, the emission spectra and 5D4 

decay curves recorded at 298 K yield comparable results to those discussed above for 24 

and 24-dehyd (Figures B.3.5 and B.3.6 in the Appendices). 

Based on the emission spectra, 5D0 lifetimes and empirical radiative and non-

radiative transition rates, and assuming that only non-radiative and radiative processes 

are involved in the depopulation of the 5D0 state, the 
5D0 quantum efficiency, q,

10-13 has 

been determined for 24 and 24-dehyd. As for compound 1,  the number of water 

molecules (nw) coordinated to Eu
3+ and Tb3+ may be determined using the empirical 

formula of Kimura &amp;amp; Kato,16 also in agreement with the formula of Horrocks.15 Data, 

including the absolute emission quantum yield (measured experimentally), are collected 

in Table 4.4 for compounds 24, 24-dehyd and 25.

5D4 
lifetime, ?, absolute emission quantum yield, ?, and the estimated number of water molecules, nw, are also 
given for [(La0.95Tb0.05)2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]·H2O (25). Data have been obtained at ambient temperature (298 K).

As expected, 24-dehyd has a relative high quantum efficiency (54%) when 

compared to the as-prepared material (15%). This occurs because of a relatively low 

non-radiative transition rate promoted by the suppression of the O–H oscillators 

associated with the coordinated water molecules, and the concomitant increment of the 

radiative transition rate. The measured maximum absolute emission quantum yield of 

24 (4% at 280 nm) is, nevertheless, far from the calculated quantum efficiency 

indicating that part of the absorbing light into the ligand excited levels relaxes non-

radiatively and not reaching the 5D0 emitting state. In contrast, compound 25 reaches a 

relatively high absolute emission quantum yield (46% at 280 nm excitation). The high 

absolute emission quantum yield observed for 25 must then be interpreted by a good 

balance between absorption, energy transfer and emission rates. Note that, as the 

dehydrated materials readily rehydrate at normal ambient conditions it was not possible 

to measure their corresponding absolute emission quantum yields.

4.4.6. Heterogeneous catalysis 

 

The catalytic performance of [La2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]·H2O (20) was investigated in 

the ring-opening reaction of styrene oxide (PhEtO) with methanol at 55 ºC (see Scheme 

3.1 in Chapter 3). The only reaction product is 2-methoxy-2-phenylethanol 

(MeOPhEtOH), which was formed in 80% yield after 24 h of reaction. Noteworthy, in 

the absence of the heterogeneous catalyst (but under similar reaction conditions) the 

conversion at 24 h was only ca. 10%. These results clearly show that 20 exhibits 

activity and excellent regioselectivity in the methanolysis of PhEtO to the ?-alkoxy 

alcohol product.  

For comparative purposes the PBUs (organic linker and the lanthanide 

precursor) were also tested under similar reaction conditions as (homogeneous) catalysts 

(using amounts equivalent to those in the loaded MOF catalyst) in the methanolysis of 

PhEtO. In the case of the ligand H6bmt, MeOPhEtOH was formed in quantitative yields 

within 1 h of reaction, indicating that the organic PBU is a highly active and selective 

homogeneous Brönsted acid organocatalyst (Table 4.5). When the lanthanide precursor 

(LaCl3·7H2O) was employed as the catalyst, MeOPhEtOH was produced in 71% yield 

at 24 h reaction (93% selectivity).

The recyclability of the catalyst 20 was investigated for three consecutive batch 

runs in the reaction of PhEtO with methanol at 55 ºC. Prior to reuse, the solid catalyst 

was separated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation, washed with n-hexane and 

dried overnight at ambient temperature. In all runs MeOPhEtOH was always the only 

reaction product and no decrease in catalytic activity was observed (Figure 4.32). On 

the contrary, it was observed an increase in the reaction rate from the first to subsequent 

runs, most likely due to an increase in the number of effective active sites. Structural

integrity of the catalyst after the first and the third runs was investigated using PXRD 

and electron microscopy (Figure 4.33). These studies clearly show that despite the large 

crystals of the as-prepared catalyst 20 were fragmented during the catalytic process 

(which may result in an enhanced amount of effective active sites) leading to a small 

loss of overall crystallinity, the framework of the material remained intact.

In order to get a better insight on the hetero/homogeneous nature of the catalytic 

reaction a leaching test was performed for 20 which consisted in filtering the used 

catalyst (through a 0.20 µm nylon GVS membrane) after 4 h reaction, at 55 ºC, and 

leaving the reaction solution under magnetic stirring for further 20 h. The ratio of the 

increment in conversion in the period of time 4-24 h of the leaching test to that for the 

reaction without catalyst is equal to 1, indicating that the catalytic reaction is 

heterogeneous in nature.

4.5. Results and Discussion 

 

The self-assembly between the tripodal organic ligand H6bmt and lanthanide 

cations, with the exception of lutetium, successfully produced three different families of 

multidimentional MOFs: 

i) 1D [Ln(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]·3H2O materials [where Ln
3+ = La3+ (9), 

(La0.97Eu0.03)
3+ (10) and (La0.97Tb0.03)

3+ (11)];

181 
 

ii) 2D layered [Ln2(H3bmt)2]·H2O materials [where Ln
3+ = Eu3+ (12), Gd3+ (13), 

Tb3+ (14), Dy3+ (15), Ho3+ (16), Er3+ (17), Tm3+ (18) and Yb3+ (19)]; 

iii) 3D [Ln2(H3dmt)2(H2O)2]·H2O materials [where Ln
3+ = La3+ (20), Ce3+ (21), 

Pr3+ (22), Nd3+ (23), (La0.95Eu0.05)
3+ (24) and (La0.95Tb0.05)

3+ (25)].  

The crystalline structure of all compounds were unveiled by single-crystal or 

powder X-ray diffraction studies, and bulk materials were fully characterized using 

standard solid-state techniques (FT-IR, electron microscopy, solid-state NMR, 

thermogravimetric and elemental analysis). 

Conventional hydrothermal synthesis (180 ºC for 72 h) was found to be an 

efficient synthetic approach for the isolation of the 2D and 3D families of materials as 

microcrystalline powders or large single-crystals, respectively. It was discovered that 

temperatures as low as 100 ºC also seem to lead to the isolation of the 3D MOFs, with 

large particle size and in periods of time varying between 1 and 3 days. The MWAS 

approach was ideal to isolate isotypical 1D compounds at mild reaction conditions (40 

ºC for 5 minutes). Remarkably, under microwave irradiation, compound 20 could also 

be prepared. Nevertheless, in this situation the employed temperature was found to be a 

crucial parameter in the self-assembly process: for 5 minutes of reaction time, phase-

pure materials can only be isolated for temperatures greater than 150 ºC. These results 

clearly indicate that by systematically investigating the synthesis of these isotypical 

systems of LnOFs it might be possible to derive optimal conditions to isolate them in 

the shortest possible period of time. Moreover, and based on investigations in the use of 

microwave irradiation performed by the MOF research group at the University of 

Aveiro,19 it might even be possible to either control the crystal morphology or size, or 

even both, or even find new functional materials. The studies led to the conclusion that 

these materials can indeed be isolated under very mild conditions, with this fact clearly 

constituting an attractive option for eventual large-scale preparations (reduced energy 

consumption and operation costs). 

From single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies, it was found that 

[Ln2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]·H2O materials are 3D MOFs, built-up on a single 

crystallographically independent lanthanide center, trapping solvent water molecules 

(both of crystallization and coordinated to the lanthanide center). As expected, the 

anionic H3bmt
3- linker was found to be a rather robust organic PBU, leading to materials 

which exhibit a typical zeolitic behaviour: by heating or applying a high vacuum, all 

water molecules could be reversibly removed from the structures; this process was 

shown to occur without loss of crystallinity or considerable structural modifications. 

These features are supported by VTXRD studies, which showed that the release of both 

coordinated and uncoordinated water molecules only induces very small modifications 

in the crystal structure of the [Ln2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]·H2O materials. The dehydrated form 

of these compounds maintains the stability and thermal robustness up to around 400 ºC. 

A drastic different behaviour was described for the 1D 

[Ln(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]·3H2O materials that exhibited comparatively very poor 



Chapter 4 

182 
 

thermal stability. The release of the five water molecules (two coordinated and three of 

crystallization) promotes structural modifications. Although not completely solved at 

this stage, the structure of the 2D layered [Ln2(H3bmt)2]·H2O materials showed 

remarkable thermal stability up to ca. 370 ºC. For this family of materials, dehydration 

did not lead to structural modifications. 

Another interesting feature found in the [Ln2(H3bmt)2]·H2O materials is related 

to their particle sizes. The inclusion of lanthanide cations with higher atomic numbers 

(i.e., smaller ionic radii) led to a drastic reduction in the average particle size, being this 

effect more noticeable in the Yb3+-based compound. In the literature some reports have 

described that the lanthanide contraction may affect the geometry and the overall 

architecture of the materials.20-22 Nevertheless, to present it seems that this system 

constitutes the first time for which this effect of the lanthanide contraction in the particle 

size is fully described. The properties of [Ln2(H3bmt)2]·H2O materials are currently 

unexplored. However, as described for compound 1n (reported in Chapter 3) the 

decrease of the crystal size in the materials may led to an improvement in their catalytic 

behavior. 

The zeolitic behaviour described for the [Ln2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]·H2O materials has 

important consequences in the observed photoluminescent properties. Firstly, the 

removal of the water molecules for the Eu3+-based material leads to a concomitant 

increase of the quantum efficiency from ca. 15% (for the as-prepared compound) to ca. 

54%. Secondly, the Tb3+ compound shows the remarkable absolute emission quantum 

yield of ca. 46% (at 280 nm excitation) reflecting a good balance between absorption, 

energy transfer and emission rates. Similar behaviour was found for the Tb3+-based 

material 11 showing an absolute quantum yield of 44%. Conversely, the Eu3+-based 

material 10 has an absolute quantum yield of only 5%. 

The catalytic performance of the La3+-based materials 9 and 20 were tested in 

the ring-opening reaction of styrene oxide with methanol. Results suggest that: i) both 

materials act as truly heterogeneous catalysts; ii) excellent regioselectivity towards 2-

methoxy-2-phenylethanol is observed, with this compound being always the sole 

reaction product; iii) catalysts can be recycled by simple and efficient regeneration 

processes; iv) the activity of 20 increases with the catalytic runs without a significant 

loss of crystallinity or modification of the crystal structure. Noteworthy, compound 9 

showed an outstanding catalytic activity compared to 20. While 9 converts 100% of 

styrene oxide in only 30 min, 20 takes 24 h to convert 80%. This remarkable activity is 

related with the active sites of 9 that are likely of Brönsted-type (associated with its 

organic component). It is worth mentioning that the very active organocatalyst H6bmt 

ligand catalyses in an homogeneous fashion, posing significant experimental drawbacks 

which can be overcomed by using the heterogeneous catalyst 9.

5.1. Initial Considerations 

 

Although not very common, perfluorinated or partially fluorinated organic linkers 

in which the hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine or ?CF3 groups have already been 

used in the preparation of functional MOFs.1-9 Compared with non-fluorinated, fluorinated 

MOFs have shown to enhance the hydrophobicity, increase structural stability in water or 

moisture atmospheres, and even to improve the photoluminescent properties.7,10-11 

Additionally, the presence of fluorine atoms as constituent of the organic molecules may 

lead to the formation of F···F interactions, helping in the stabilization of the resulting 

networks.5,12 

Fully or partially fluorinated MOFs have been studied, mainly, as potential 

materials for application in adsorption processes,3,8-9 and luminescent devices.13-14 The 

research group of Omary reported the synthesis of totally fluorinated MOFs, coined as 

FMOF-1 and FMOF-2, from the combination of Ag+ with 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)-1,2,4-

triazolate.10,15-16 The hydrophobic character of FMOF-1 is the main responsible for the 

observed efficient selective adsorption ability of aliphatic and aromatic oil components 

(benzene, toluene, p-xylene, cyclohexane and n-hexane), while preventing the entrance of 

water molecules in their pores. In 2006 Chen et al. isolated two Er3+-organic frameworks, 

[Er2(bdc)3(DMF)2(H2O)2]·H2O and [Er2(bdc-F4)3(DMF)(H2O)]·DMF, by using the organic 

linkers 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (H2bdc) and its fluorinated analogue 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-

1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (H2bdc-F4), respectively.
14 In this comparative study the authors 

showed that the replacement of the C-H fluorescence quencher by C-F groups improves 

significantly (approximately three times) the near-infrared luminescence properties. 

Noteworthy, the use of fluorinated organic molecules does not, however, ensure just by 

itself an improvement in the desired properties of the resulting material. A striking 

example concerns the work reported by Banerjee’s group on a handful of fluorinated and 

non-fluorinated MOFs. The results showed that it is difficult to evaluate the influence of 

the fluorination on the H2 and CO2 adsorption.
1-2 

Optically-active lanthanide- (or mixed-lanthanide)-based compounds have found 

potential applications in the fabrication of sensing devices.17-19 As described in Chapters 3 

and 4, the MOF research group at the University of Aveiro has been interested in the 

preparation of luminescent Lanthanide-Organic Frameworks (LnOFs). Following this line 

of research, a novel fluorinated tripodal organic ligand ((2,4,6-trifluorobenzene-1,3,5-

triyl)tris(methylene))triphosphonic acid (H6tftp) was designed and prepared in a simple 

three-step reaction procedure (Scheme 2.6). This molecule is a structural analogue of 

(benzene-1,3,5-tryiltris(methylene)triphosphonic acid (H6bmt) whose MOF structures 

were described in Chapter 2. H6tftp was self-assembled with lanthanide cations under 

hydrothermal conditions to produce a new family of isotypical LnOFs, formulated as 

[Ln(H3tftp)(H2O)] [where Ln
3+ = La3+ (26), (La0.95Eu0.05)

3+ (27), (La0.95Tb0.05)
3+ (28).20 The 

crystal structure of 26, isolated as large single-crystals, was unveiled by single-crystal X-

ray diffraction and consists of neutral ?
2[La(H3tftp)(H2O)] layers. All materials were fully 

characterized by standard solid-state techniques (powder X-ray diffraction, FT-IR, electron 



Chapter 5 

188 
 

microscopy (SEM and EDS), solid-state NMR, thermogravimetric and elemental analysis). 

The photoluminescent properties of the compounds 27 and 28 were investigated. 

 

 

5.2. Strategy 

 

The presence of O-H, C-H and/or N-H groups (usually belonging to solvents 

molecules, such as water and the most common organic solvents, or organic linkers) in the 

close proximity of lanthanide centers quench their photoluminescence properties through 

non-radiative processes.14,21-23 An alternative option to circumvent this limitation would be 

to suppress the presence of such oscillator groups. Reduction/elimination of the quenching 

effect can also be achieved from the deuteration of O-H (as described in Chapter 3) and C-

H groups, or by replacing C-H for C-F bonds in the organic molecules. Having in mind this 

idea, the trifluorinated H6tftp organic molecule was designed and prepared.  

Due to the structure similarity between H6tftp and H6bmt it is aimed at the 

preparation of MOFs sharing the same crystalline structure of the 1D, 2D or 3D 

compounds reported in Chapter 4. It is also suggested a comparative study of the 

photoluminescent properties between the optically-active MOF materials isolated by using 

H6tftp and H6bmt. 

 

 

5.3. Synthesis 

 

5.3.1. Hydrothermal Synthesis of isotypical [Ln(H3tftp)(H2O] materials 

 

The self-assembly between the new tripodal organic ligand H6tftp and lanthanide 

(III) chloride hydrates, under hydrothermal conditions (180 ºC for 72 h), afforded a new 

family of MOF structures composed of three isotypical materials formulated as 

[Ln(H3tftp)(H2O)] [where Ln
3+ = La3+ (26), (La0.95Eu0.05)

3+ (27) and (La0.95Tb0.05)
3+ (28)] 

(see sub-section 8.12.1 in the Experimental Section for further details). Compound 26 was 

the only one that could be isolated with suitable particle size to be investigated by single-

crystal X-ray diffraction. Phase identification of the mixed-lanthanide materials 27 and 28 

as microcrystalline powders was performed using powder X-ray diffraction. 

Figure 5.1 shows the PXRD patterns and SEM images of all materials. PXRD 

patterns indicate that compounds are crystalline and share the same crystalline phase. 

Concerning morphology it is clear that all compounds have the same crystal habit based on 

block-like crystals. A notable feature stands out: compound 26 possesses crystalline block-

like particles with sizes in the tens of micrometers; the inclusion of 5% of Eu3+ or Tb3+ 

leads to a reduction of the average particle size of 27 and 28, with this feature being 

significantly more evident in the latter material.

Figure 5.1 - PXRD patterns and SEM images of compounds 26, 27 and 28 prepared 
(under hydrothermal conditions) at 180 ºC for 72 h. 

 

 

In addition, the use of stoichiometric amounts of different lanthanides in the initial 

reactive mixtures leads to isotypical materials having a random distribution of the metallic 

centers throughout the framework. This evidence is supported from EDS mapping studies 

for the mixed-lanthanide materials 27 and 28 (Figures 5.2 and 5.3).

5.3.2. Isolation of large single-crystals of isotypical [Ln(H3tftp)(H2O] 

materials 

 

The procedure to isolate compound 26 as large single-crystals is similar to that 

described in the previous sub-section with slight modifications. Reactive mixtures 

composed of the new tripodal organic ligand H6tftp and LaCl3·7H2O in distilled water 

were prepared. A few drops of an aqueous solution of HCl (6 M) were added. The reaction 

mixture was kept at 180 ºC during 72 h (see dedicated Experimental Section for further 

details). 

 The isolated material was characterized by PXRD, unequivocally confirming that 

this material share the same crystalline phase with compound 26, and electron microscopy. 

Figure 5.4 shows a SEM image of compound 26 evidencing the presence of large single 

crystals. The addition of some drops of HCl (6 M) led to a substantial increase (from 

approximately 20 to ca. 100 µm) of the particle size of 26.

few drops of an aqueous solution of HCl (6 M) were added. 

 

 

5.4. Crystal Structure Description of [La(H3tftp)(H2O)] 

 

The self-assembly between the tripodal trifluorinated H6tftp organic ligand and 

LaCl3·7H2O under hydrothermal conditions produced compound [La(H3tftp)(H2O)] (26). 

Large crystals were directly harvested from the reaction vessels and studied by single-

crystal X-ray diffraction. Compound 26 crystallizes in the centrosymmetric triclinic P? 

space group (see sub-section 8.12.1 in the Experimental Section for further details). The 

asymmetric unit is composed of two La3+ metal centers, two whole (H3tftp)
3- residues and 

two coordinated water molecules.  

The two crystallographically independent La3+ metal centers are heptacoordinated, 

{LaO7}, to one water molecule and six independent phosphonate groups from four H3tftp
3- 

residues. All phosphonate groups bear an uncoordinated ?OH moiety with the two other 

oxygen atoms being connected to La3+ metal centers in a typical µ2-O,O’ bridging mode. 

The La–O bond lengths to phosphonate groups range from 2.361(6) to 2.595(7) Å and the 



Chapter 5 

192 
 

La–Owater distances are 2.591(6) and 2.593(6) Å. The O–La–O angles composing the 

coordination spheres were found in the 73.3(2)-161.5(2)º range (see Figure 5.5 and Table 

C.1.1 in the Appendices for additional geometrical details). The overall coordination 

environment of the metal centers resembles a monocapped trigonal prism, with the trigonal 

and quadrangular internal angles found in the 43.4(2)-91.7(3)º and 76.7(2)-100.6(2)º 

ranges, respectively (Fig. 2). 

 

 

Figure 5.5 - Polyhedral representation of the {LaO7} distorted monocapped trigonal 
prismatic coordination environments of the two crystallographic independent La3+ 
centers present in 26: (a) La1 and (b) La2. For selected bond lengths and angles see 
Table C.1.1 in the Appendices. 

 

 

As shown in Figure 5.6 the crystallographically independent pairs of metal centers 

and organic residues are highly superimposable. Moreover, the calculated root mean 

squares (rms) of 0.005 and 0.04 Å for the coordination spheres of the lanthanum atoms and 

the organic residues, respectively, are comparable with the experimental error of the 

atomic positions (for instance, the average C–C bond precision is 0.0133 Å). This fact 

could, in principle, indicate problems in the determination of cell parameters and/or the 

space group of compound 26. Nevertheless attempts to find better cell parameters or space 

groups always produced the crystallographic data displayed in the sub-section 8.12.1 (in 

the Experimental Section) as the best choice. Additionally, the presence of six 31P 

resonances in the solid-state NMR spectrum of 26, and the existence of nine Stark 

components in the 5D0?
7F2 transition at 14 K (see dedicated sections for further details) 

for the isotypical compound 27, agree well with the current proposal for the structural 

model of this series of materials. 

The combination between the H3tftp
3- organic residues and La3+ metal centers 

originates a two-dimensional ?
2[La(H3tftp)(H2O)] neutral coordination polymer placed on 

the ac lattice plane of the unit cell (Figure 5.7). Despite the hydrophobic aromatic rings of 

H3tftp
3- being located in the walls of the polymeric layers, they are not engaged in ?-? 

stacking interactions. Weak supramolecular F···F interactions are present within the 

hydrophobic wall (see legend of Figure 5.7 for additional details), with all C–F···F angles 

being comprised in the 139.6(6)-142.0(6)º range. The similarity between these values and 



Layered MOF Based on ((2,4,6-Trifluoro-1,3,5-triyl)tris-(methylene)triphosphonic Acid 

193 
 

their interaction angle allows to classify unequivocally these interactions as of type I, 

ultimately considering them as of weak nature. Indeed, for the F···F interactions being 

considered strong (type II), the C–F···F angles should be markedly distinct with values of 

approximately 90 and 180º.24 Instead, the fluorine atoms are engaged in intramolecular C–

H···F interactions (not shown).

calculated as ca. 0.005 and 0.04 Å for the metal centers and organic linkers, 
respectively.

195 
 

All phosphonate groups point to the interlamellar space forming a lanthanum oxide 

layer and an intricate hydrogen bond network as depicted in Figure 5.8. All oxygen atoms 

of this network are located within a layer with thickness of ca. 1.8 Å, also parallel to the ac 

lattice plane. Two pairs of rings with graph set motifs R22(6) and R
2
2(8) are the most 

remarkable features of this network. The R22(8) set motifs are formed by two 

hydrogenophosphonate groups (with O···O distances ranging from 2.568(9) to 2.692(9) Å 

and O?H···O interaction angles between ca. 153 and 161º). The R22(6) graph set motifs 

comprise one hydrogenophosphonate group and one water molecule (with internuclear 

O···O distances ranging from 3.109(8) to 3.154(9) Å and O?H···O interaction angles 

between 113 and 143º; for further geometrical details see Table C.1.3 in the Appendices). 

The most significant packing forces between layers are weak van der Waals interactions. 

This structural feature can be related with the low crystal robustness of 26 and further 

explains the great difficulty of finding suitable single-crystals for X-ray diffraction studies. 

 

 

5.5. Thermogravimetry and Variable Temperature Powder X-ray 

Diffraction Studies 
 

The thermal stability of the isotypical materials 26, 27 and 28 was investigated 

between ambient temperature and ca. 800 ºC. The thermograms of the three materials 

exhibit slight different profiles (Figure C.1.1 in the Appendices), with this fact being 

attributed to the decrease of the average particle size of compounds 27 and 28 (see SEM 

images in Figure 5.1): materials with smaller average particle size are expected to have a 

higher surface area, being ultimately thermally less stable, hence leading to distinct overall 

thermal behaviors. The decomposition behavior of 27 and 28 start at lower temperatures 

than that registered for 26. This is more evident for compound 28 (corresponding to the 

smallest average particle size). In spite of these differences the thermal decomposition of 

materials 26-28 occurs in a rather similar fashion as depicted in Figure C.1.1 (in the 

Appendices).  

In order to understand the temperature effect in the crystal structure itself, 

VTPRXD studies on bulk 26 were performed between ca. 30 to 700 ºC. Compound 26 is 

thermally stable from ambient temperature to approximately 200 ºC. In this temperature 

range no weight loss is observed (Figure 5.9 – bottom left), with the crystal structure 

remaining intact (Figure 5.9 – top right). The first weight loss occurs between ca. 207 and 

357 ºC, being attributed to the release of the coordinated water molecules and the 

beginning of the material deterioration. As observed from the VTPRXD patterns a 

dramatic loss of crystallinity occurs during the first weight loss. After this temperature, 

several weight losses are observed leading to the formation of an amorphous residue at 

approximately 450 ºC. At ca. 700 ºC a residue composed of a mixture of lanthanum 

catenatriphosphate (LaP3O9, ICDD 00-033-0717) and monazite (LaPO4, ICDD 01-071-



Chapter 5

6745) was identified by powder X-ray diffraction studies (PDF4+ 2012 release ICDD 

database).

(26).  

 

 

5.6. Solid-State NMR and FT-IR Spectroscopic Studies 

 

To gain more insight on the composition of the asymmetric unit and phase purity of 

the bulk materials, solid-state NMR studies were performed on bulk material 26 containing 

the La3+ diamagnetic metallic center. The 31P MAS spectrum exhibits, in the isotropic 

region, two well-resolved resonances. After deconvolution, six peaks centered at ca. 8.4, 

9.6, 10.6, 11.8, 16.9 and 17.0 ppm were found (Figure 5.10), agreeing well with the 

presence of six crystallographic distinct phosphorus sites. Peak deconvolution and 

integration, including the spinning sidebands, provides a ratio of ca. 1.00 : 1.00 : 1.00 : 

1.00 : 1.00 : 1.00.   



Layered MOF Based on ((2,4,6-Trifluoro-1,3,5-triyl)tris-(methylene)triphosphonic Acid 

197 
 

The 13C{1H} CP MAS spectrum (Figure C.1.2 in the Appendices) contains three 

distinct spectral regions: the –CH2? groups appear as a broad peak centered at ca. 23.2 

ppm; the aromatic C–C and C–F moieties appear in the 100-115 ppm (peaks at ca. 106.0 

and 108.6 ppm) and 150-170 ppm (peaks at ca. 156.8, 157.8, 159.3 and 160.2 ppm) 

spectral ranges, respectively. These data are consistent with the performed crystallographic 

studies, agreeing particularly well with the presence of two organic ligands in the 

asymmetric unit of 26. 

 

 

Figure 5.10 - Experimental (black) and deconvoluted (light brown) 31P HPDEC MAS 
spectra of compound 26. Spinning sidebands are denoted using an asterisk. Peak 
deconvolution and integration throughout the entire spectral range (i.e., including the 
spinning sidebands) gives a ratio of ca. 1.00 : 1.00 : 1.00 : 1.00 : 1.00 : 1.00 for the 
isotropic resonances peaking at ca. 8.4, 9.6, 10.6, 11.8, 16.9 and 17.0 ppm, 
respectively. The grey lines represent the individual fits for the single resonances. 

 

 

FT-IR spectroscopy studies (Figure 5.11) indicate that the bulk materials 26, 27 and 

28 are indeed isotypical. Thus, in the following paragraphs only the spectral features for 

compound 26will be discussed, being assumed that identical considerations are valid for 

the remaining materials 27 and 28. 

 The FT-IR spectrum of 26 is mainly composed of two relevant spectral regions. In 

the 3750-2500 cm-1 range one can observe: (i) the typical ?(O?H) stretching vibrational 



Chapter 5 

198 
 

modes of the coordinated water molecules (at ca. 3493 and 3446 cm-1) and of the PO?H 

groups (at ca. 3213 cm-1); and (ii) a weak and sharp band observed at ca. 2941 cm-1 

attributed to the ?(C?H) stretching vibration of the ?CH2? groups.  

Below 1800 cm-1 the FT-IR spectrum of 26 is complex with a large number of 

medium-to-very strong vibration bands.25 At ca. 1673, 1625 and 1602 cm-1 it is possible to 

observe the ?(H2O) and ?(?C=C?) in-plane deformations. The very intense peak at around 

ca. 1470 cm-1 is attributed to a ?(?C=C?) stretching vibration mode of the aromatic ring, 

being frequently observed with the presence of electron acceptors connected to the 

aromatic rings. Two medium intensity bands peaking at ca. 1420 and 1409 cm-1 belong to 

the ?CH2? deformation vibrational modes from the P?CH2 groups. Additionally, the 

?(P=O) and ?(C?F) modes appear in the 1350-1050 cm-1 range, followed of a set of 

vibration bands between 1040 and 900 cm-1 attributed to the ?(P?O) modes. The ?(P?C) 

stretching vibrations are centered at ca. 763 and 745 cm-1.25

5.7. Photoluminescence 
 

The photoluminescence properties of the isotypical mixed-lanthanide compounds 

[(La0.95Eu0.05)(H3tftp)(H2O)] (27) and [(La0.95Tb0.05)(H3tftp)(H2O)] (28) were investigated 

both at ambient and low temperature and compared with the starting H6tftp ligand and the 

former compound [La(H3tftp)(H2O)] (26). The excitation spectra of 27 and 28, while 

monitoring the emission at 616 and 542 nm within the Eu3+ 5D0?
7F2 and Tb

3+ 5D4?
7F5 

transitions, respectively, are shown in Figure 5.12. Spectra are dominated by a broad UV 

band (240-280 nm) which may be attributed to the ?-?* transitions associated with the 

organic linkers. This assignment was further confirmed by monitoring the singlet UV 

emission at 330 nm in both the H6tftp ligand and compound 26 (Figure 5.12). The 

excitation of 26 is slightly red shifted relatively to that of H6tftp and resembles the UV 

broad band observed for 27 and 28. The additional sharp extra lines in the spectra of 27 

and 28 were identified as the intra-4f6 transitions 7F0?

The emission spectra of compounds 27 and 28, recorded at ambient temperature 

(using an excitation wavelength of 270 nm), are shown in Figure 5.13. The sharp lines are 

assigned to the transitions between the first excited non-degenerate 5D0 state and the

levels of the fundamental Eu3+ septet, and between the first excited state 5D4 and the 
7F6-0 

levels of Tb3+ for 27 and 28, respectively. The emission spectrum of 27 shows a 

predominance of the 5D0?
7F2 transition comparatively to the 

5D0?
7F1. The identification 

of, at least, nine Stark components in this spectrum for the 5D0?
7F2 transition at 14 K 

(inset in Figure 5.13) clearly indicates the presence of at least two low-symmetry Eu3+ 

environments in the crystal structure. This feature agrees well with the performed 

crystallographic studies (see dedicated section for further details).

The ambient temperature 5D0 and

were determined by monitoring the emission decay curves within the maximum of the 
5D0?

7F5 transitions, using an excitation at 393 and 376 nm, respectively 

(Figure 5.14). Both decay curves can be well fitted by single exponential functions, 

yielding lifetimes of 0.51±0.01 and 1.26±0.01 ms for 27 and 28, respectively. For distinct 

excitation and/or the emission detection wavelengths identical lifetimes values were 

systematically obtained.

Considering the presence of the two distinct Ln3+ environments in the crystal 

structures, the determination of single exponential decay curves arises as a further 

indication of the strong similarity between the two crystallographically independent Ln3+ 

sites in terms of the emission decay lifetime. Note that, based on crystallographic studies, 

both Ln3+ metal centers have the same coordinated elements on the first sphere (seven 

oxygen atoms: six belonging to six independent phosphonate groups and one belonging to 

a water molecule) with very similar Ln–O distances (see Table C.1.1 in the Appendices for 

further details). At 14 K the 5D0 decay curve of 27 has also a single exponential behaviour 

independently of the excitation and emission wavelengths, yielding a lifetime of 0.56±0.01 

ms (data not shown). Noteworthy, the calculated lifetime is not dependent of the emission 

wavelength detection.

The measured absolute emission quantum yields, ca. 1% at 270 nm and 12% at 393 

nm for 27, and ca. 7% at 270 nm and 4% at 376 nm for 28, are relatively low. The low 

emission performance of the mixed-lanthanide Ln3+-based light emitters is certainly the 

result of the combination of two main factors: (i) the presence of one water molecule in the 

first coordination sphere of the crystallographically independent Ln3+ cations, and (ii) an

inefficient ligand-to-Ln3+ energy transfer mechanism. The latter assumption is further 

supported by the observation of the singlet ligand emission in the UV spectral region for 

compound 27, under 270 nm excitation at ambient temperature (Figure 5.15). The UV 

emission broad band has a very short lifetime, less than 10 µs, which is below the range of 

the used phosphorimeter. A similar UV emission band was also detected for the Tb3+-based 

material 28 (data not shown).

5.8. Results and Discussion 

 

In this Chapter a family of new isotypical layered MOFs was reported: compounds 

[La(H3tftp)(H2O)] (26), [(La0.95Eu0.05)(H3tftp)(H2O)] (27) and [(La0.95Tb0.05)(H3tftp)(H2O)] 

(28) were prepared from the reaction between lanthanide chloride hydrated salts with the 

novel organic ligand H6tftp under hydrothermal conditions. All materials were 

characterized by using in tandem several standard solid-state techniques. 

The use of conventional hydrothermal synthesis with the same synthetic conditions 

(temperature, 180 ºC; time, 3 days; water as reaction medium) as for 2D and 3D LnOFs 

12-25 previously reported in Chapter 4, led to a distinct architecture. The two-dimensional 

?
2[La(H3tftp)(H2O)] neutral coordination polymer (isolated when H6tftp was used) has a 

completely different crystalline structure than the 2D and 3D materials, prepared when the 

non-fluorinated H6bmt organic ligand was employed. The 2D material 



Layered MOF Based on ((2,4,6-Trifluoro-1,3,5-triyl)tris-(methylene)triphosphonic Acid 

203 
 

?
2[La(H3tftp)(H2O)] has the hydrophobic aromatic rings pointing to the interlamellar space, 

and the phosphonate groups and metal centers forming an internal inorganic sheet.  

Regarding to the thermal stability, the fluorinated compound 26 suffered a drastic 

loss of crystallinity upon release of the coordinated water molecules (from approximately 

200 ºC), contrasting with the thermal behaviors of the 2D materials 12-19 (thermally 

robust up to approximately 400 ºC) and 3D materials 20-25 (showing very small structural 

modifications after the dehydration process). The structure of the 1D materials 9-11 suffers 

some structural alterations during the release of the coordinated and crystallization water 

molecules, however, it remains crystalline.   

As mentioned in Chapter 1 and observed in Chapters 3 and 4, one of the major 

challenges resides in the preparation of phosphonate-based MOFs with large particle sizes. 

For the material described in this Chapter, the addition of small amounts of an aqueous 

solution of HCl (6 M) to the reactive mixtures led to the isolation of compound 26 as large 

single-crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies.  

Mixed-lanthanide materials with stoichiometric amounts of optically-active 

lanthanides have been studied with results unequivocally showing that the presence of the 

O?H vibrations of the coordinated water molecules, composing the first coordination 

sphere, quench the photoluminescence of compounds 27 and 28. In addition, it was 

demonstrated that for the materials reported in this Chapter the ligand-to-metal charge 

transfer mechanism is poorly efficient, with the combination of these two factors leading to 

low absolute emission quantum yields. In this way it is pertinent that future work is 

devoted to investigate alternative synthetic ways to produce new LnOF materials using the 

novel organic ligand H6tftp but without water molecules in the first coordination sphere of 

the metallic center. In this way, it is envisaged that more efficient photoluminescent 

materials could be isolated, aiming at their use for the construction of sensing devices. 

Besides changing the reaction parameters (such as temperature, reaction time, solvent, 

among others), the present studies clearly show that future work could be focused on the 

use of other heating methods such as microwave heating and one-pot reactions. These 

approaches could have the advantage of allowing a faster and low energy-consuming 

synthetic process (two attractive features to industrial processes and for scaling up). 

The materials reported in this chapter constitute the first example in which a 

fluorinated phosphonate organic ligand has been used for the preparation of 

multidimensional MOFs with lanthanide cations. Despite of this, and based on the 

conclusions summarized above, the main objective of this work was not achieved: even 

though the sole difference between H6tftp and H6bmt is the replacement of hydrogen of 

the aromatic ring by fluorine atoms, isotypical functional MOF materials sharing the same 

crystalline structure of the previously reported architectures 12-25 based on residues of 

H6bmt could not be isolated. In this way, the photoluminescence of the two families of 

materials could not be straightforwardly compared, and the influence of the C-F groups 

instead the C-H bonds in the final properties could not be assessed.

6.1. Initial Considerations 

 

As mentioned in Chapter 1, the quest for porosity in MOFs is the most required 

feature from worldwide researchers. The design and synthesis of rigid, large and 

multipodal O- and N-donor organic PBUs to combine with metallic centers seems to have 

a strong influence in the porosity and architecture of the desired material. Keeping this in 

mind, several research groups have prepared different organic linkers with these 

requirements. In this context, MOFs assembled from very large bi-, tri- or tetrapodal 

organic molecules in their structure, conferring them high porosity, have been reported 

over the years. As also described in Chapter 1, the 3D MOF materials reported until now 

have pores with diameters varying from few to dozens of angstroms (IRMOF-74-XI with 

pore diameter of 100 Å)1 and world records in surface areas (e.g., NU-110 with a BET 

surface area of 7140 m2g-1)1-2 when compared with other common porous materials (i.e., 

zeolites or active carbons). This feature in conjugation with other functionalities have 

conferred to this type of materials the ability to store high quantities of gases (i.e., H2 and 

CH4) to be used as clean energy and to retain, from mixture of gases, the non-

environmentally friendly CO2, while retaining their crystalline structure. 

To evaluate the porosity of a given MOF it is normally performed static adsorption 

experiments using N2 (at 77 K), Ar (at 77 K) and CO2 (at 195 or 273 K). The obtained data 

allow us to have insights about some physical features of MOFs, such as: i) accessibility of 

gases to the framework; ii) gravimetric or volumetric adsorption capacity to retain gases; 

iii) specific surface area; iv) adsorption enthalpies and v) network stability (i.e., permanent 

porosity) after evacuation of the guest solvent molecules.3 The latter feature provides 

information to know if the network collapses or preserve its crystalline integrity after the 

releasing of the solvent molecules. This process is performed under vacuum at high 

temperatures to include guest molecules of interest (e.g., H2, N2, CO2 or CH4). Figure 6.1 

depicts the adsorption/sorption process which may occur in a porous MOFs. The 

adsorption process occurs, normally, after the activation (i.e., desolvation), under heating, 

of the porous MOF. This procedure leads to the availability of all adsorption sites capable 

to adsorb the gases of interest. Then, heating the material, while passing an inert gas flux, 

allows the sorption process with the consequent release of the gas molecules.

The parameters mentioned above are determinated from the measurement of the 

typical experimental adsorption isotherms using the small noble gas Ar and/or small 

molecules such as N2 and CO2 (at the condensation temperature of the corresponding gas). 

The adsorption of a given substance in a material is measured according to the quantity of 

a gas adsorbed at a certain temperature in function of the gas pressure in equilibrium with 

the solid material. There are different types of adsorption isotherms (Figure 6.2):3-7  

 

Figure 6.2 – Representation of the six different types of adsorption isotherms. 
Reproduced from reference 4. 

 

 

i) Type I: correspond to the adsorption in microporous materials (i.e., MOFs, zeolites 

and active carbons). The majority of the micropores are filled at low relative 

pressures (below than 0.1); 

ii) Type II: is related with the multilayer adsorption and reflects the statistical 

thickness of the N2 adsorbed by the material (typical for the adsorption of N2 on 

macroporous compounds, as for instance, SiO2 and Al2O3). The monolayer 

coverage is, then, followed by coverage of multilayers; 

iii) Type III: common associated to both non-porous and microporous compounds. 

Existence of weak gas-solid interactions (e.g., adsorption of H2O molecules on 

noble metals or carbons). The weak interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent 

leads to low uptake at low relative pressures and high uptake at higher relative 

pressures; 

iv) Type IV: associated to multilayer adsorption and pore condensation in mesoporous 

materials, as for instance silica and alumina (e.g., adsorption of N2 on MCM-41 

type material (mesostructured silica)). The presence of a hysteresis loop is very 



Porous Yttrium-Triphosphonate MOF 

211 
 

often associated to the existence of mesopores. However, higher uptakes only occur 

at high relative pressures. 

v) Type V: as for the adsorption isotherm type III, this corresponds also to weak gas-

solid interactions (e.g., adsorption of H2O molecules on noble metals). It may be 

attributed to microporous or mesoporous materials; 

vi) Type VI: typical for homogeneous multilayered and non-porous adsorbents (as for 

instance, adsorption of Kr on graphite).  

Adsorption isotherms only provide information about the texture of the porous 

materials and their affinity to gases of interest. Nevertheless, if it is necessary to evaluate 

the potential of a porous MOF for gas separation processes it is required other more 

advanced studies. In the front line of this research is the group of Navarro who have 

prepared MOFs capable to capture nerve agents (i.e., sarin and mustard gas analogues)8-9 

and harmful volatile organic compounds (benzene, ciclohexane and tiophene)10, 

incorporated and released the non-conventional [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2(pta)] RAPTA-C 

metallodrug,11 and studied the ability of pyrazolate-based MOFs towards the separation of 

CO2 from binary (CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4)
12-14 and ternary (CO2/CH4/C2H2)

12 gas mixtures. 

These investigations allowed to gain insights about the potential of their porous pyrazolate-

based MOFs to be used in gas separation processes, mainly, to capture CO2.  

Gas separation measurements are performed using two advanced methods:12 

i) Pulse gas chromatographic experiments to evaluate the possible application of a 

given MOF on gas separation purification. This methodology allows to determine 

the capacity of a porous MOF to retain gases into their structure. Gases having 

higher affinity with the structure of a material are retained during longer periods of 

time. This is a preliminary qualitative test before quantitative measurements. 

Usually it is used a mixture of several gases (e.g., H2, CH4, C2H2, CO2, C2H4, C2H6, 

C3H6 and C3H8) and an inert carrier gas (e.g., He). The experiments are carried out 

at different temperatures (273, 298, 303, 323 K and if necessary higher 

temperatures). The resulted data consist in a chromatogram showing the retention 

time of each gas (Figure 6.3); 

ii) Gas separation breakthrough studies. This is a quantitative method and it is 

performed after a first screening using the previous methodology. This approach is 

adequate for the bulk separation of gases. As mentioned above, it is required a 

binary (e.g., CO2/CH4) or ternary (CO2/CH4/C2H2) mixture of gases using, as for 

instance, He as diluting gas in order to avoid pressure drops in the column. The 

used experimental temperature may be the same as for pulse gas chromatographic 

experiments. Gases with affinity for the structure of a porous MOF are more 

retained, while gases with lower affinity are rapidly released. The obtained data 

allow us to determine the quantity of a given gas into the structure of a porous 

MOF at different temperatures. Figure 6.4 depicts typical breakthrough curves.

Figure 6.3 – Representation of pulse gas chromatogram curves exemplifying the gas 
separation process according to the affinity between the porous MOF material and the 
gases of interest. The gas of the reference curve (e.g., H2) is represented in black and 
the curves in blue, green and red correspond to the different gases using on the 
measurement, as for instance, CH4, C2H2 and CO2, respectively. In these experiments 
it is always used an inert carrier gas (generally He). rtn (where n = 1, 2, 3 and 4) is 
attributed to the retention time of each gas. 

 

 

 

Figure 6.4 – Example of a CO2/CH4 breakthrough experiment: because CO2 has 
more affinity with the porous MOF material, it is retained into its structure 
during longer periods of time than CH4, which does not interact with the 
material. In these experiments the inert carrier gas (generally He) is always used. 

 

 

This Chapter describes the preparation of a porous Yttrium-Organic Framework 

based on a large tripodal phosphonate-organic ligand, termed as H6L. To the best of 

knowledge there are only three works reporting the organic ligand H6L: i) Beckmann et al. 

reported, for the first time, the synthesis and structural elucidation of this molecule as a 

potential organic PBUs to employ in supramolecular chemistry;15 ii) one year later, in 

2009, the research group led by Shimizu reported the preparation of a microporous 

interpenetrated alkaline-earth phosphonate material, termed as 

[Sr2(H2L)(CH3OH)(H2O)4].
16 This MOF material showed some affinity to CO2, however, it 

also exhibited weak capacity to retain high quantity of this gas; iii) in the same year, 

Ouellette and co-workers reported the synthesis of a 2D oxovanadium-arylphosphonate 

structure, formulated as [V3O3(OH)(H3L)2]·7.5H2O, being to date the first example of a 

mixed-valence compound having core.17

H6L is an analogue of the 4,4’,4’’-benzene-1,3,5-triyltribenzoic acid (BTB) organic 

linker (Figure 6.5). The latter was employed with Zn2+ cations for the self-assembly of the 

well-known highly porous MOF-177 (cage diameter of 14.4 Å).18 Both H6L and BTB 

possess the phosphonic and carboxylic acids, respectively, located in order to confer them 

a planar triangular geometry. The geometry of both organic linkers and the fact that they 

large and relatively rigid structure confer them good properties to be used as organic PBUs 

for the preparation of 3D porous MOFs.

This chapter describes the synthesis of the family of isotypical porous MOFs, 

formulated as [RE(H3L)]·xH2O·yMeOH [where RE
3+ = Y3+ (29); (Y0.95Eu0.05)

3+ (30) and 

(Y0.95Tb0.05)
3+ (31)] from the self-assembly of H6L with respective rare-earth cations, 

under hydro(solvo)thermal conditions. The preparation of this novel materials can be 

performed employing distinct synthetic methodologies: i) conventional solvothermal 

synthesis; ii) slow diffusion; iii) the bench “one-pot” approach; and iv) ionothermal 

synthesis. In addition to all these four methodologies to produce compound 29 as a 

crystalline material, its preparation as large crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray 

diffraction studies was only possible by using the solvothermal synthesis while adding HCl 

(6 M) to the reaction mixtures.  

The crystalline structure of 29 was unveiled by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and 

all materials were characterized by standard solid-state techniques (powder X-ray 

diffraction, FT-IR, electron microscopy (SEM and EDS), thermogravimetric and elemental 

analysis). The adsorption properties of the porous compound 29 were investigated. This 

compound, with a specific BET surface area of 719 m2 g-1, has the ability to retain CO2 

(1.89 mmol g-1) into their structure from a binary mixture of CO2/N2. This MOF can also 

separate small amounts of C3H8, almost pure, from a binary C3H8/C3H6 mixture. Aiming to 

improve the selective adsorption capacity of 29 towards CO2, it was prepared the ion-

exchanged [Y(H3L)]·xSolvent_K (32) material. After adsorption studies, it was possible to 

conclude that 32 has the ability to retain CO2 into their network at higher temperatures, 

which was not observed for 29. This is probably due to the inclusion of K+ cations into the 

porous structure of the as-prepared material 29. Additionally, compound 32 showed to be 

able to separate C2H2, during a short period of time, from a ternary gas mixture composed

of N2/C2H2/CO2. Preliminary photoluminescent properties of compounds 30 and 31 were 

investigated. 

 

 

6.2. Synthesis 

 

6.2.1. Synthetic strategy 

 

Aiming at the preparation of compound 29 as large single-crystals for X-ray 

diffraction studies, it was tested a set of synthetic methodologies: i) conventional 

solvothermal synthesis; ii) slow diffusion; iii) the bench “one-pot” approach; and iv) 

ionothermal synthesis. All the four approaches employed led to 29 as a microcrystalline 

white powder. Isolation of large crystals of 29 was only achieved under solvothermal 

conditions while adding HCl (6 M). 

 

Conventional solvothermal synthesis  

A reactive mixture composed of H6L and YCl3·6H2O, with an overall 1:4 

(H6L:Y
3+) molar ratio, in a mixture of H2O/MeOH (v/v 7:3) was prepared and kept at 140 

ºC for 48 h. After reacting, the desired compound 29 was isolated as microcrystalline white 

powder. Figure 6.6 shows the PXRD pattern and the morphological features (small rod-like 

particles with an average size of approximately 1-2 µm) of 29. The mixed rare-earth 

materials with 5% of Eu3+ (30) or 5% of Tb3+ (31) dispersed in a Y3+ matrix were prepared 

following the same procedure for 29 while adjusting the desired amounts of the lanthanide 

chloride salts.

Because 29 did not have large enough particle size to be studied using single-

crystal XRD, the optimization of various reaction parameters took place: 

- Temperature: 100, 140 and 180 ºC; 

- Heating/cooling temperature ramps: i) 1 h (from ambient temperature to 140 ºC) ? 

24 h (isothermal at 140 ºC) ? 48 h (cooling to 30 ºC); ii) 1 h (from ambient 

temperature to 140 ºC) ? 48 h (isothermal at 14 ºC) ? 72 h (cooling to 30 ºC); iii) 

1 h (from ambient temperature to 140 ºC) ? 120 h (isothermal at 14 ºC) ? 96 h 

(cooling to 30 ºC);  iv) 48 h (from ambient temperature to 140 ºC) ? 24 h 

(isothermal at 14 ºC) ? 48 h (cooling to 30 ºC); and v) 24 h (from ambient 

temperature to 140 ºC) ? 48 h (isothermal at 14 ºC) ? 72 h (cooling to 30 ºC). 

Figure 6.7 depicts an example of a heating/cooling temperature program used in the 

optimization process to isolate 29 as single-crystals;

- Reaction time: 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 days; 

- Solvent: H2O, H2O/MeOH (v/v 7:3), H2O/MeOH (v/v 1:3), H2O/MeOH (v/v 1:4), 

H2O/MeOH (v/v 1:9), H2O/MeOH (v/v 7:3) and few drops of HF or HBF4; 

- Metal source: YCl3·6H2O and YNO3·xH2O; 

- (Ligand : Metal) molar ratio: 1:2, 1:4, 1:12 (H6L:Y
3+). 

After varying all these synthetic parameters, it was still not possible to isolate 

compound 29 as large single-crystals. 

 

Ionothermal  synthesis  

Reactive mixtures composed of H6L and YCl3·6H2O were prepared in 1-butyl-3-

methylimidazolium chloride [BMIm]Cl, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride [EMIm]Cl 

or in a euthetic mixture containing choline chloride and urea. Besides the use of different 

ionic liquids and a euthetic mixture, other reaction parameters were varied: i) temperature 

(140 and 150 ºC); ii) reaction time (48, 72 and 98 h); and iii) H6L:Y
3+ molar ratio (1:2 and 

1:4). 



Chapter 6 

216 
 

The ionothermal synthetic approach afforded compound 29, however, once again, 

as a microcrystalline white powder (Figure 6.8). Morphologically, the particle size and 

shape of 29 are very similar when compared to those particles obtained by 

hydro(solvo)thermal synthesis.  

 

 

One-pot  synthesis  

As reported in Chapter 3, one-pot synthesis has been a viable alternative to isolate 

MOF materials with large particle size, being known as a simple and low-energy 

consumption method. Therefore, reactive mixtures containing H6L and YCl3·6H2O, with 

an overall (H6L:Y
3+) molar ratio of 1:4, in H2O/MeOH (v/v 7:3) or [EMIm]Cl were 

prepared. The resulting solution was kept under constant magnetic stirring. The reaction 

time (2, 24, 48 and 72 h) and temperature (ambient temperature, 60 and 100 ºC) were 

varied. 

Such as for the previous synthetic procedure, the preparation of compound 29 as 

single-crystals was unsuccessful. Nevertheless, this method showed to be a very good 

alternative to isolate 29 as a microcrystalline powder, in milder reaction conditions. The 

distribution of particle size is not however very homogeneous and the morphology is not 

regular and well-defined (Figure 6.8). Additionally, “one-pot” synthesis seems to be able 

to isolate 29 in large amounts (i.e., in the gram-scale) in a simple way under mild 

conditions. 

 

Slow diffusion  

This method is very slow, unattractive for industry and affords small quantities of 

the desired materials. Nevertheless, slow diffusion synthesis is, probably, the best 

alternative to grow crystals. Some attempts were performed to isolate single-crystals of 29 

using this approach: 

i) an aqueous solution of YCl3·6H2O was layered with other containing H6L and 

MeOH. The reaction occurred at ambient temperature during 20 days; 

ii) an aqueous solution of YCl3·6H2O was layered with 1-octanol; a third layer 

containing H6L and MeOH was added. The reaction was kept at ambient 

temperature for 30 days; 

iii) a solution composed of YCl3·6H2O and [EMIm]Cl was layered with H2O, and then 

another solution containing H6L and MeOH (third layer) was added. The reaction 

was kept at ambient temperature for 20 days. 

Within all these three attempts, compound 29 was again isolated as a microcrystalline 

white powder. Concerning morphology, this synthetic method afforded larger particles 

(with some of them reaching approximately 20 µm) with needle-like shape (Figure 6.8). 

Unfortunately, 29 was still not composed of crystals with enough size for single-crystal 

XRD studies.

Preparation of compound [Y(H3L)]·xH2O·yMeOH as large single-crystals  

A solution of YCl3·6H2O dissolved in distillated water was added to a solution 

composed of the large tripodal organic ligand H6L and HCl (6 M) (0.25, 0.5, 1, 3 or 5 mL) 

in H2O/MeOH. The resulting reactive reaction mixtures were kept according to the 

following temperature program: 48 h (from ambient temperature to 140 ºC), 24 h 

(isothermal at 140 ºC) and 48 h (cooling to 30 ºC) (see sub-section 8.13.1 in the 

Experimental Section for further details).  

The addition of higher amounts of HCl (6 M) to the reaction mixtures led to a 

considerable increase in the particle size of compound 29, while the crystalline structure 

remained intact. The exception was for the reaction where it was used 5 mL of HCl (6 M) 

which afforded a mixture of the crystalline phase of 29 with a secondary one (Figure 6.9). 

This method allowed, thus, the isolation of large single-crystals (note the presence of 

particles with sizes higher than 100 µm) for the desired XRD studies. Compound 29 

comprises needle-like particles which break when submitted to high vacuum during the 

SEM analysis. This is, probably, due to the release of the solvent molecules from the 

crystalline structure.

6.3. Crystal Structure Description of the Porous Material 

[Y(H3L)]·xH2O·yMeOH 
 

 The structural details reported in this section come from a preliminary elucidation 

of the crystal structure of 29, with further crystallographic studies being needed, specially 

to investigate the behaviour of the solvent molecules in the channels. 

 Large needle-like crystals of 29 were directly harvested from the reaction vessels. 

This compound crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pna21 space group. The asymmetric unit 

of 29 comprises a single crystallographically independent Y3+ metallic center, an organic 

ligand moiety and several (being not exactly determined yet) solvent molecules (water and 

methanol). The connection of the Y3+ metal center to six oxygen atoms, belonging all to 



Porous Yttrium-Triphosphonate MOF 

219 
 

six phosphonate groups of different organic ligands, leads to the formation of a {YO6} six-

coordinated distorted octahedra (Figure 6.10).  

   

 

Figure 6.10 – Schematic representation of the distorted {YO6} coordination 
octahedron present in the material 29: the yttrium metallic center and the oxygen 
atoms composing the polyhedra are represented as lime and red spheres, respectively.   

 

 

 The arrangement between the phosphonate-based organic ligands and the Y3+ 

cations leads to the formation of a 3D structure comprising one-dimensional channels, with 

distorted hexagonal geometry, running along of the [100] direction of the unit cell (Figure 

6.11). Because the refinement of the crystalline structure of 29 is still not completed, the 

solvent molecules filling the channels of 29 are not represented. Another crystallographic 

feature that stands out is the presence of 1D hydrogenophosphonate yttrium chains running 

along of the [100] direction of the unit cell.

the [100] direction of the unit cell. Solvent molecules were omitted for clarity.

6.4. Thermogravimetry and Variable Temperature Powder X-ray 

Diffraction Studies 
 

The thermal behavior of compound 29 was investigated between ambient 

temperature and ca. 800 ºC from thermogravimetric analysis (Figure 6.12 – bottom left). 

Additionally, to gain insight into the structure modifications that occur in the crystal 

structure of 29, VTPXRD studies (in the 30-600 ºC temperature range) were also 

performed (Figure 6.12 – top right). 

From the thermogravimetric curve of 29 it is possible to observe that the first 

weight loss occurs below ca. 100 ºC (precisely, between ambient temperature and ca. 82 

ºC). This step corresponds to a weight loss of ca. 22.7% and it is attributed to the release of 

all the solvent molecules contained into the framework of 29. VTPXRD studies show, at 

ca. 50 ºC, a structural modification in the crystalline structure of 29 due to this first weight 

loss process. This may be endorsed to contraction of the network of the porous material 

during the release of the water and methanol molecules. Noteworthy, the new desolvated 

structure is highly robust until approximately ca. 400 ºC being not visible any additional 

weight loss or structural modification. 

After ca. 376 ºC, two weight losses of 21.7 and 5.2% are observed. These are 

related with the decomposition of the organic components leading to a drastic loss of 

crystallinity and, consequently, to the formation of an amorphous residue at ca. 560 ºC.

diffraction patterns (top right) of the porous material 29.

6.5. FT-IR Spectroscopy 
 

 The FT-IR spectrum of the porous material 29 (Figure 6.13) exhibits diagnostic 

bands of the various structural features described above. As previously mentioned, 29 has 

solvent molecules (water and methanol) of crystallization in their channel structure. The 

FT-IR spectrum exhibits a very broad band in the ca. 3723-2555 cm-1 spectral range, 

attributed to the overlap of the typical ?(H2O)cryst, ?(CH3O-H) cryst, ?(POH) and ?(-CH2-) 

stretching vibrational modes. 

 Below 1800 cm-1 the FT-IR spectrum of 29 is quite complex, exhibiting a large 

number of weak-to-very strong vibrational bands attributed, mainly, to the large H6L 

organic ligand. Based on the literature19 the typical in-plane deformation of water 

molecules appears at ca. 1632 cm-1 as a vibration band of medium intensity, followed of 

three medium weak bands centred at ca. 1600, 1557 and 1503 cm-1, respectively, attributed 

to the ?(-C=C-) stretching vibration modes of the aromatic rings. Additionally, the typical 

?(P=O) stretching vibrations, with very strong intensity, are present at ca. 1144 and 1075 

cm-1. At ca. 925 and 829 cm-1 the ?(P-O) vibration modes appear as bands of strong 

intensity.

6.6. Adsorption Properties 
 

As mentioned in Chapter 1, in the last years several scientific research groups have 

dedicated great efforts in the preparation of porous MOFs envisaging their application in 

the sequestration, separation and purification of gases with industrial and environmental 

interest. The selective adsorption capacity of the porous material toward some gases (CO2, 

C2H2, C3H8 and C3H6) was, thus, investigated. The selective adsorption of propane, 

propylene, acetylene and carbon dioxide over as, for instance nitrogen and methane may be 

related with some differences in their physical properties, such as kinetic diameter, 

polarizability (?), quadropole moment (?) and dipole moment (µ).20 

The first step of these studies started with the acquisition of the conventional single 

component adsorption isotherms in order to study the porous nature of the materials, 

followed by more complex and advanced studies such as pulse gas chromatography and 

gas separation breakthrough studies. 

 

6.6.1. Static adsorption experiments 
 

In order to evaluate the accessibility of guest molecules into the porous framework 

of compound 29, the N2 at 77 K and CO2 at 195 K adsorption isotherms were collected 

(Figure 6.14). Both N2 and CO2 adsorption isotherms display type-I behavior, being 

characteristic of crystalline microporous materials. Material 29 possesses specific BET 

surface areas of 104 and 719 m2 g-1 measured from the N2 and CO2 adsorption isotherms, 

respectively.  

 

 

Figure 6.14 – N2 (diamond) and CO2 (circle) adsorption isotherms measured at 77 and 
195 K, respectively. The filled and empty symbols represent adsorption and 
desorption processes, respectively.  



Porous Yttrium-Triphosphonate MOF 

223 
 

Compound 29 has much higher adsorption capacity for CO2 than for N2. This fact 

may be associated with kinetic reasons, avoiding the diffusion of N2 molecules into the 

porous framework. At higher adsorption temperatures, in this case 195 K, the CO2 

molecules have larger kinetic energy, contrasting with the lower one to N2 at 77 K. 

Therefore, CO2 molecules are able to enter into the pores of the material and, 

consequently, there is no diffusion limitation. As a consequence of that the adsorption 

values are more reasonable. The diffusion limitations of N2 molecules at 77 K are not an 

uncommon result, being typical of ultramicroporous materials with pore size &amp;lt;0.5 nm.21-22 

 

6.6.2. Pulse gas chromatography experiments 

  

The potential application of the porous material 29 in gas purification processes 

was investigated. A chromatographic column was constructed and then packed with 29 

(Figure 6.15). The pulse gas chromatography experiments have been performed in the 273-

403 K temperature range using two different gas mixtures: i) C2H2/CO2/H2; and ii) 

C3H6/C3H8/H2. Each experiment consisted in the injection, at 1 bar, of the previously 

mentioned equimolecular gas mixtures (0.6 mL) on the home-made chromatographic 

column, packed with the porous materials (previously activated at 423 K for 4 h), at 

different temperatures (273-403 K). The separation gas performance has been examined by 

means of a mass spectrometer gas analysis system. During the experiments a constant inert 

He flow (20 mL min-1) was used as the carrier gas. The interaction between H2 and the 

studied materials is almost negligible, being used as reference value for the column dead 

volume. Figure 6.16 depicts the instrumentation used to perform the gas separation 

measurements. 

 

Figure 6.15 – Picture of the home-made chromatographic column packed with the 
porous material 29 to use in the gas adsorption measurements. The glass wool is used 
to avoid the escape of 29 when the gas fluxes are flowed. 

 

 

Pulse gas chromatograms for an equimolar mixture of C3H8/C3H6/H2 colected at 

different temperatures using 29 show that this material can retain C3H8 and C3H6, mainly at 

lower temperatures (see Figure D.1.1 in the Appendices for further details). At higher 

temperatures (i.e., 363 and 403 K) both C3H8 and C3H6 are retained into the structure of 29 

during short periods of time. Decreasing the experimental temperature, the tested gases are 

retained during longer periods of time leading to a peak enlargement of the 



Chapter 6 

224 
 

chromatograms. Nevertheless, it is well visible that C3H6 has higher affinity with the 

porous structure of 29, remaining retained during longer periods of time than C3H8.  

Regarding the experimental measurements toward the separation process of CO2 

and C2H2, the results suggest that compound 29 allows considerably interactions with both 

gases (see Figure D.1.2 in the Appendices for further details). It is nevertheless possible to 

observe that 29 has more affinity for C2H2, being this gas retained, mainly, at lower 

temperatures (e.g., 273 K) for longer periods of time than CO2 (Figure 6.17).

tests: (top) overview of the equipment composed of flux gas controllers, a gas 
chromatograph and a mass spectrometer; (bottom left) flux gas controllers for different 
gases of interest; and (bottom right) view of the home-made chromatographic column

6.6.3. Gas separation breakthrough studies 
   

Breakthrough curves were measured to evaluate the performance of the porous 

material 29 in the bulk separation of gas mixtures. These experiments were performed 

using the home-made chromatographic columns described in the previous section, packed 

with the porous material 29. Before flowing the desired gas mixtures the column was 

activated at 423 K for approximately 4 h under a pure He flow (20 mL min?1). 

The first experiment used two gas mixtures, C3H8/N2 (10 mL min
-1 : 10 mL min-1) 

and C3H6/N2 (10 mL min
-1 : 10 mL min-1), to evaluate the performance of 29 in the 

retention of propane and propylene at 273 and 296 K (see Figures 6.18 and D.1.3 in the 

Appendices). Figure 6.18 displays the C3H8/N2 and C3H6/N2 breakthrough experiments at 

273 K for 29. The results show that N2 is not retained into the porous network of 29, while 

C3H8 and C3H6 have strong interactions with the framework, being C3H6 more retained 

(Table 6.1). These results are in agreement with the pulse gas chromatography studies, 

became also in those experiments it is possible to observe that C3H6 has stronger 

interactions with 29 than C3H8. 

 

 

Figure 6.18 – (left) C3H6/N2 and (right) C3H8/N2 breakthrough curves measured at 273 
K for the porous material 29. 

 

 

 In the second experiments, mixtures of N2 (17 mL min
-1) and CO2 (3 mL min

-1), 

simulating the emission of a flue gas from a power plant, were flowed through 29, at 273 

and 298 K. The obtained breakthrough curves revealed that CO2 is selectively retained 

while N2 flew through the materials (Figure 6.19). The breakthrough curve for 29, 

measured at 273 K, shows that CO2 is retained into the porous structure of this material 

during 5.92 min. This result means that 1.89 mmol of CO2 is retained per gram of 

compound 29. At higher temperatures (i.e., 298 K) it is observed a drastic decrease in the 

adsorption capacity of 29 towards CO2. All data are summarized in Table 6.1.

A complex ternary gas mixture, CH4/CO2/C2H2 (14 mL min
-1 : 3 mL min-1 : 3 mL 

min-1), was also tested to assess, qualitatively, the interaction of these gases with 

compound 29 at 273 K. From the breakthrough curves (Figure 6.20) is possible to observe 

that CH4 was not retained into the framework. The interactions between CO2 and C2H2 

with the porous material 29 are very similar, being these gases more retained than CH4. 

Because CO2 and C2H2 are released practically at the same time, it seems that the 

separation between these two gases is not possible under the applied conditions.

Finally, it was collected other breakthrough curves flowing through the compound 29 

a gas mixture composed of He (10 mL min-1), C3H8 (10 mL min
-1) and C3H6 (10 mL min

-1) 

at 273 and 297 K. He was used as diluting gas since both C3H8 and C3H6 are strong 

interacting adsorbents. As expected, based in previous breakthrough experiments, C3H8 

and C3H6 have strong interaction with the framework of 29. Although both gases are 

jointly retained, C3H6 has stronger interaction with 29 (Figure 6.21). Therefore, during a 

certain period of time (between 3.98 and 5.17 min) the porous material 29 is able to 

separate propane from propylene which is of industrial interest.

6.6.4. Preparation and adsorption properties of the ion-exchanged 

[KxY(H3-xL)]·ySolvent 

 

In order to improve the adsorption properties of the porous material 29, mainly in 

the retention of CO2, several ion-exchange experiments were performed. Ethanolic 

solutions of KOH (0.5, 0.25, 0.05 and 0.025 M) were prepared. After optimization, it was 

found that the best conditions for the ion-exchange reaction consisted in the use of more 

diluted solutions of KOH, once the more concentrated ones afford amorphous or poorly 

crystalline materials. Therefore, reaction mixtures containing 0.025 g of 29, KOH (0.05 M) 

in 5 mL of ethanol was prepared and then, ultrasonicated for approximately 5 min. The 

resulting suspension was stirred at ambient temperature during 24 h. After that, the final 

compound, formulated as [KxY(H3-xL)]·ySolvent (32) was recovered by vacuum filtration 

and air-dried at ambient temperature. 

After characterization by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), it was observed that 

material 32 has a different PXRD pattern than the starting material 29 (Figure 6.22). These 

differences may be, probably, related with some distortion in the framework of 29 

promoted by the inclusion of K+. Because the ion-exchanged material 32 was isolated as 

powders, its crystalline structure remains unknown.

228 
 

 

Figure 6.22 - PXRD patterns of the as-prepared material 29 and of the ion-exchanged 
material 32. 

 
  
Gas separation breakthrough studies 

Preliminary adsorption tests were performed for the ion-exchanged material 32. 

Measurements were very similar to those for material 29: a chromatographic column was 

packed with 32, being then activated at 443 K for approximately 4 h under a pure He flow 

(20 mL min?1). 

The performance of 32 in the bulk separation of a mixture of gases was evaluated. 

A mixture composed of N2 (17 mL min
-1) and CO2 (3 mL min

-1) was flowed through 

material 32 at 273, 297 and 323 K (Figure 6.23). Results show that, as expected, N2 is not 

retained in the column. However, different behavior is visible for CO2 which interacts 

strongly with 32. Although the amount of carbon dioxide (1.53 mmol g-1) retained at 273 K 

is lower than that observed, under the same conditions, for 29 (1.89 mmol g-1), at higher 

temperatures (297 and 323 K) compound 32 is capable to adsorb larger amounts of this gas 

(Table 6.2). This improvement is, probably, related with the presence of K+ cations in the 

framework of the 32.

The last measurement was based on the use a complex ternary gas mixture containing N2 

(14 mL min-1), CO2 (3 mL min

qualitatively, the interaction of material 32 with the last two gases. As for the previous 

experiments, N2 is not retained in the column. Nevertheless, C2H2 and CO2 have strong 

interaction with 32, being the latter gas more retained (Figure 6.24).

6.7. Stability Studies under Constant CO2 Flow  
 

 In this section it will be described the stability and robustness of the porous material 

29, after desolvation, under a constant CO2 flow measured at different temperatures and 

flow pressures. 

Compound 29 was packed in a quartz capillary (? = 0.5 mm) and placed in a home-

made sample holder (Figure 6.25). A constant He flow was passed through the material 

while heated from 303 to 375 K (heating ramp of 6 K/h). The latter temperature was kept 

for 1h30min (while using a constant He flow) to achieve the complete desolvation of 29. 

After dehydration, the temperature was cooled down to 303 K (cooling ramp of 2 K/h) and 

the gas flux was replaced from He to CO2. After stabilization the flux of CO2 (during 

approximately 45 min), the pressure was increased for 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 bar, remaining 

constant for 25 min at each pressure level. Then, the CO2 flow pressure was allowed to 

decrease to 1 bar and the temperature cooled down to 273 K (cooling ramp of 2 K/h). The 

CO2 flow pressure was manipulated in a quite similar way to that used for the 

measurements performed at 303 K. Finally, the desolvated form of 29 was maintained at 

273 K, under a small and constant CO2 flow for approximately 8 h. In all the experience 

steps, powder X-ray diffraction patterns were collected with intervals of 5 s. All these 

investigations were performed in the beamline ID11 of the European Synchrotron 

Radiation Facility (ESRF) (Grenoble, France).

The stability and robustness of the porous material 29 regarding its desolvation 

process and exposure to a constant CO2 flow was studied by high-resolution synchrotron 

powder X-ray diffraction. Studies started, as mentioned above, with the desolvation of 29 

using a constant He flow while increasing the temperature from 303 to 375 K. During this 

process it was observed a structural modification promoted by the release of the solvent 

molecules. The new phase remained stable for a long period of time and it seems to be 

more crystalline than the original one (Figure 6.26).

After the desolvation step, the experimental temperature was decreased to 303 K. 

Figure 6.27 shows a small decrease in the crystallinity of the studied material (mainly 

observed in the first peak) during the cooling process, however, the crystalline structure 

remains the same. The flow of He was replaced for CO2 in order to evaluate if the 

accommodation of this gas induces some structural modification in the desolvated form of 

29. Therefore, these measurements were initialized by allowing the passage of a small CO2 

flow through the capillary containing the material. Pressure was increased for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 

bar and, finally, decreased for 1 bar. Despite some variation in the crystallinity of the 

material, promoted by the variation of the pressure, its structure remained robust and stable 

(Figure 6.28).

Decreasing the temperature for 273 K it is not detected, once again, any structural 

alteration (Figure 6.29). The effect of different pressures in the desolvated material 29 it 

was evaluated at that temperature. As describe above for the measurements performed at 

303 K the structure of the material does not suffer any modification (Figure 6.30).

6.8. Photoluminescence Studies 
 

The photoluminescent properties of the mixed-rare earths materials 30 and 31 were 

investigated. The excitation spectra of the both compounds (at ambient pressure and under 

a vacuum of ca. 10-5 mbar) were recorded while monitoring within the strongest Eu3+ 
5D0?

7F2 and Tb
3+ 5D4?

7F5 emission transitions, respectively (Figure 6.31). The spectra 

are dominated by a broad UV band composed by two main components attributable to the 

excited states of the organic ligand moieties. This attribution was confirmed recording the 

excitation spectra of 30 (under vacuum, Figure 6.31) monitoring their fluorescence 

emission at 385 nm (discussed below). The typical intra-4f6 and 4f8 transitions of Eu3+ and 

Tb3+, respectively, cannot be properly recognized on the corresponding excitation 

spectrum, indicating an efficient sensitization of Eu3+ and Tb3+, via the excited states of the 

ligand comparatively to their direct excitation. 

 

 

Figure 6.31 - Excitation spectra of 31 (?Em. = 549.5 nm, green) and 30 (?Em. = 609.3 
nm, black) at ambient pressure and under vacuum (?Em. = 611.4 nm, red; ?Em. = 385, 
purple) while monitoring the emission of the Tb3+ and Eu3+ ions, and of the ligand, 
respectively. The spectra have been recorded at ambient temperature (solid lines) and 
at 12 K (dotted lines). 

 

 

The emission spectra of 30 and 31, recorded at ambient conditions (297 K) and 

with excitation at 320 nm, are provided in Figure 6.32. The sharp emission lines of 30 and 

31 are assigned to the 5D0?
7F0-4 and 

5D4?
7F6-3 transitions, respectively, which originates

a red and green emitted light. Although, after instantaneous exposure (under ambient 

conditions) to the excited UV light, the visible emissions are relatively bright, their 

intensities quickly decrease becoming negligible in the time range. Thus, it is necessary to 

record a complete emission spectra (ca. 10 minutes) due to, most probably, an effective 

photobleaching of the compounds. Because of that, the emission spectra are uncorrected 

and are only presented to elucidate the emission capability of the Tb3+ and Eu3+.  It is 

noticeable a loss of the emission intensities on the high wavelength region for both spectra. 

In the other hand, as observed for 30 (Figure 6.32 on top), the samples under vacuum (ca. 

10-3 mbar) undergo a phase transformation (evidenced by the changes observed on the Eu3+ 

emission lines) and their emissions became stable. This demonstrates that the application 

of a vacuum is able to remove the solvent molecules (water and methanol) located into the 

channels promoting the phase transition, which should be the responsible for the 

photobleaching activation observed at ambient pressure. This is in agreement with 

VTPXRD investigations, where it was possible to observe structural modifications after the 

release of the solvent molecules.

ambient pressure (red line) and under vacuum (black line) with excitation at 320 nm. 

 

 

Encompass the effective sensitization of the Tb3+ and Eu3+ emitter ions by the 

ligand moieties mentioned above, the concentration of the optical active Ln3+ ions used in 

the present case is not enough to receive all the UV light absorbed by the ligands and to 

eliminate the intrinsic photoluminescence of the ligands in UV and visible region. In fact, 



Chapter 6 

236 
 

as can be seen in Figure 6.33, the complete emission spectra of 30 under vacuum in the 

UV/Vis region is characterized by the predominance of a strong UV band on the 340-440 

nm range, which at 12 K has a structured profile. Considering the results of the time-

resolved emission spectra depicted in Figure 6.33, this band should be attributed to the 

superposition of the S1?S0 fluorescence of the ligand (evidenced with the very short live 

detection conditions) and to a most probably emission of their phosphonate groups, which 

has some similarities with the emission of norbornene derived phosphonates recently 

presented by Bhattacharya et al.23 Note that the residual emission band obtained in the 

340-440 nm spectral region, applying an initial delay of 1 ms, cannot be attributed to the 

common ligand fluorescence, and in the present situation it has the exact same profile as 

the emission band collected in the stationary state mode. Because of that, it can be 

speculated the possible function of the phosphonate groups as optical active elements 

which can be also sensitized by the pure organic part of the ligand moiety. An additional 

emission in the region of 450 to 550 nm is also observed at 12 K which, based on their 

long lifetime characteristics and their temperature dependence, is attributed to the ligand 

triplet phosphorescence emission, probably conjugated with the phosphonate groups. More 

detailed and comprehensive studies are needed to complete discern the role of the 

phosphonate groups on these promising optical active systems.

6.9. Results and Discussion 
 

 This chapter summarized the synthesis and application of a family of isotypical 

porous MOFs, termed as [RE(H3L)]·xH2O·yMeOH [where RE
3+ = Y3+ (29); (Y0.95Eu0.05)

3+ 

(30) and (Y0.95Tb0.05)
3+ (31)]. These compounds were typically prepared as 

microcrystalline powders. Isolation of large crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray 

diffraction studies was a hard task. The material 29 may be prepared by using several 

synthetic methods under very distinct reaction conditions: i) conventional solvothermal 

synthesis (140 ºC for 48 h); ii) bench “one-pot” synthesis (60 ºC for 24 h); iii) slow 

diffusion (ambient temperature for approximately 3 weeks); and iv) ionothermal synthesis 

using the ionic liquid [EMIm]Cl (140 ºC for 72 h). Figure 6.34 summarizes the employed 

synthetic approaches and the corresponding reaction conditions. 

 

 

Figure 6.34 – Schematic representation of the synthetic approaches and reaction 
conditions used to isolate compound 29. 

 

 

Despite the several attempts and efforts, isolation of 29 as large particles was 

unsuccessful. Nevertheless, using conventional solvothermal conditions and adding 

different amounts of HCl (6 M) to the reactive mixtures single-crystals were isolated. 

Thus, it is possible to conclude that this step is the key factor to improve crystallinity. 

Moreover the increase of the amount of HCl (6 M), until certain point, in the reaction 

mixtures leads to a substantial increase of the particle size.  

The bench “one-pot” approach exhibited itself, once again, as an excellent 

alternative to prepare large amounts (i.e., in the gram-scale) of desired MOF 29 at milder 

reaction conditions during acceptable periods of time. This methodology has in this way a 

handful of attractive features which make it a strong synthetic alternative to large scale 

synthesis: it allows the preparation of MOFs in a very simple way with low energy-

consumption. 



Chapter 6 

238 
 

From thermal analyses, it was possible to observe that the crystalline structure of 

compound 29 suffers some modifications when submitted to thermal treatment. Although 

the structure of 29 is still not completely elucidated, preliminary studies indicated that this 

porous material has its channels filled of solvent molecules (water and methanol) of 

crystallization. Therefore, the release of these molecules occurs easily from low 

temperatures (the solvent molecules are released below ca. 100 ºC). This fact may induce a 

rearrangement, as for instance a possible contraction, in the network of 29. Nevertheless, it 

is noteworthy to observe that the new desolvated material is robust being stable up to 

approximately 400 ºC. This is an uncommon feature, which mechanically appears 

nevertheless more often in phosphonate-based MOFs than, for instance, in carboxylate-

based ones. In this context, this robustness provides this material the possibility to be 

applied in areas which require more severe conditions (e.g., higher temperatures and 

activation of the pores). 

 The selective adsorption properties of compound 29 were studied. From the 

conventional single component adsorption isotherms it was observed that this material is 

able to incorporate significant amounts of CO2 molecules into its structure. Regarding to 

N2, compound 29 presents some diffusion problems toward this gas. This behavior appears 

as typical of ultramicroporous materials with pore size &amp;lt;0.5 nm. Additionally, the 

performance of 29 in gas separation processes, using binary (i.e., C3H6/C3H8 and CO2/N2) 

and ternary (i.e., CH4/CO2/C2H2 and N2/CO2/C2H2) mixtures of gases, was evaluated by 

employing advanced measurements: pulse gas chromatography and gas separation 

breakthrough measurements. After these tests, the results suggest that the desolvated form 

of compound 29:  

i) has the ability to retain higher amounts of propylene (4.47 mmol g-1 at 273 K and 

4.03 mmol g-1 at 296 K) than propane (3.13 mmol g-1 at 273 K and 2.59 mmol g-1 at 

296 K);  

ii) is able to separate to nearly 100% of purity propane from a mixture composed of 

C3H6/C3H8 during a certain period of time; 

iii) shows the capacity to selectively adsorb CO2 (polar gas) over the N2 (non-polar); 

iv) has high affinity for acetylene (observed from the pulse gas chromatographic 

measurements) over CO2; the separation of these gases was not, nevertheless, 

achieved using a mixture composed of CO2/C2H2. 

Propylene-propane separation processes, using porous MOFs, have been tested by 

several scientists because this field is of great scientific and industrial interest.20,24-29 In the 

reported MOFs the higher affinity to propylene over propane is related to the presence of 

the C=C bond: the ?* orbital interacts typically with the electron density of the metal 

cations, leading to strong interactions with this gas over propane.20,28,30-32 

The CO2/C2H2 separation is also of significant industrial interest. Acetylene is an 

important molecule which has been used as starting material, as for instance, for the 

production of chemical products.33 However, opposite to C3H6/C3H8 separation, the 



Porous Yttrium-Triphosphonate MOF 

239 
 

selective separation between C2H2 over CO2 was, unfortunately, not achieved with 29. This 

fact may be due to the similarity existing between the nature of them, as for instance, their 

sublimation points, critical temperatures and molecular size.34 In order to improve the 

selective CO2/C2H2 separation it was prepared the ion-exchanged compound 32 using 29 as 

starting material. Results suggest that 32 has higher capacity to adsorb CO2, mainly at 

higher temperatures. Performing a preliminary breakthrough measurement it was possible 

to observe that this new material exhibits the ability to retain CO2 while C2H2 is firstly 

released. Thus, the purification of acetylene (of approximately 100%) using a CO2/C2H2 

gas mixture was achieved during a certain period of time (for approximately 1 minute). 

The improvement in the separation process may be attributed to the introduction of the K+ 

cations into the framework of 29. These sites may allow the coordination with CO2 

molecules, improving their affinity with the material. This behavior leads to a later release 

of CO2 from the porous structure of 32, allowing first the release of C2H2, which has not 

strong affinity with the material. Additionally, the selectively adsorption of CO2 over C2H2 

may be further improved if, as for instance, two chromatographic columns packed with 32, 

instead one, can be used.   

 To the best of knowledge, only two reports describe the adsorption capacity of 

phosphonate-based MOFs toward some gases (i.e., CO2, CO and CH4). In 2008, Wright’s 

group reported that a porous MOF, termed Ni-STA-12, had the ability to uptake ten times 

CO2 (2.5 mmol g
-1) than CH4 at 304 K from 0 to 1 bar.

35 Latter, in 2012, the same research 

group performed some breakthrough tests using a family of STA-12 porous materials 

(having Mg, Mn, Fe, Co or Ni as metallic centers).36 The STA-12(Ni) material exhibited 

CO2 selective adsorption over CH4 and CO. This material showed selectivities to CO2 of 

6.5 (at 1 bar) and 24.4 (at 5 bar) at 303 K using a CO2/CH4 (1:1) gas mixture. The latter 

work is the unique example reported in the literature describing gas separation 

breakthrough studies using a phosphonate-based MOF for the selective adsorption of CO2 

over other gases. The work reported in this chapter constitutes the first time a phosphonate-

based MOF has been used for C3H6/C3H8, CO2/N2, CH4/CO2/C2H2 and N2/CO2/C2H2 

separation processes. 

The effect of the desolvation process of the porous material 29 as well as the 

influence of different CO2 flow pressures was investigated by high-resolution synchrotron 

powder X-ray diffraction (performed in ESRF). These experiments aimed to gain insight 

on the stability and robustness of the crystalline structure of this compound. These 

involved different two main tasks: i) evacuation of the solvent molecules of the studied 

material using a He flow; and ii) variation of the CO2 flow pressures (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 bar) 

at 273 and 303 K. The obtained data suggest that it occurs some structural modifications in 

29 after its desolvation process, affording a new desolvated material still more crystalline. 

These observations agree to those collecting in the VTPXRD studies. Nevertheless, it was 

concluded that this new phase is highly robust and stable when different CO2 flow 

pressures were tested at different temperatures (273 and 303 K). 

 The photoluminescent properties of compounds 30 and 31 were investigated. Eu3+- 

and Tb3+-based materials emitted relatively intense red and green light, respectively. 



Chapter 6 

240 
 

Nevertheless, these intensities decrease very quickly and it was not possible to collect a 

complete emission spectra in the time range needed. This fact may be related to an 

effective photobleaching resulting from the instability and possible degradation of the 

tested compounds. As mentioned above, the release of the solvent molecules (water and 

methanol), even at low temperatures, of 29 led to structural modifications. This may justify 

the difficulty in collecting the photoluminescence data. These results are only some 

preliminary studies and it is necessary to investigate in more details these properties.

 For this PhD project it was proposed as the main objective the preparation of 

functional and multidimentional MOF materials from the self-assembly of rare-earth 

cations with new phosphonate-based organic ligands designed and isolated in large 

amounts. Efforts were directed and focused toward the optimization of the ideal reaction 

conditions as well as the choice of the best synthetic approaches to isolate both organic 

linkers and multidimentional MOFs in high yields and, at the same time, with a high level 

of purity.  

 The preparation of the phosphonate-based organic ligands H4pmd, H6bmt, H6tftp 

and H6L involved the strict optimization of several reaction conditions (e.g., reaction time, 

temperature and solvents). Synthetic approaches used the conventional heating synthetic 

methods or microwave heating which permitted the use of mild reaction conditions and a 

drastic reduction of the total reaction time (as observed for the preparation of the large 

tripodal H6L organic ligand). This latter approach afforded the expected organic molecules 

in higher yields and in a fast, clean and safe way. These prepared multipodal linkers 

showed to be suitable organic PBUs to employ (together with several rare-earth cations) 

for the preparation of various and structurally distinct functional multidimentional MOFs. 

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction in tandem with the standard liquid-state NMR 

spectroscopy and mass spectrometry proved to be useful tools to unequivocally unveil and 

characterize the structure of all organic ligands. 

The structural properties of the organic ligands arises, undoubtedly, as crucial 

factor in the preparation of multidimentional MOFs, mainly concerning their final 

architecture. The use of the more flexible bipodal H4pmd and tripodal H6bmt and H6tftp 

molecules led to the preparation of 1D to 3D relatively dense MOF materials. Conversely, 

the large and rigid H6L ligand directed the isolation of the porous [Y(H3L)]·xH2O·yMeOH 

(29) material. The results found in this thesis come in line with those of several reports 

published in the literature, in which porous, or highly porous MOF materials have been 

isolated by using rigid and, very often, very large organic ligands. The presence of the 

methylene ?CH2? moiety in the former ligands embodies the former organic PBUs with 

some degree of flexibility, resulting instead in the preparation of more dense MOFs.  

 The isolation of the several multidimensional MOFs was achieved by employing 

distinct synthetic approaches: i) conventional hydro(solvo)thermal synthesis; ii) synthesis 

using microwave or ultrasound irradiation; iii) bench “one-pot” synthesis; iv) ionothermal 

synthesis. The hydro(solvo)thermal synthesis showed, as expected, to be a good choice to 

isolate large single-crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction studies. Nevertheless, the 

preparation of the [Ln(Hpmd)(H2O)] (1-3) and [Ln2(H3bmt)2]·H2O (12-19) materials with 

large particle size it was not achieved. 

Due to the general harsh reaction conditions (high temperatures) and long periods 

of time needed to prepare MOFs using the conventional hydro(solvo)thermal approach, 

other simpler, faster, cleaner and with low energy-consumption synthetic methodologies 

were investigated. MWAS and the bench “one-pot” approaches emerged as good 

alternatives. Owing the easy close control of various reaction parameters (i.e., reaction 

time and temperature, power and pressure), MWAS allowed the preparation of different

architectures using the same organic and inorganic PBUs: i) the self-assembly between 

H4pmd and La
3+

 cations produce the 1D [La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)12] (4) and the 3D 

[La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)2] (5) materials while varying the temperature and the irradiation 

time; ii) a similar behaviour was observed in the preparation of the phase-pure 1D 

[La(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]·3H2O (9) and 3D [La2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]·H2O (20) from reaction 

mixtures composed of H6bmt and La
3+

 cations in distilled water. Additionally, MWAS 

also permits a drastic reduction of the reaction time and temperature of the preparation of 

MOF materials usually synthesized using conventional hydrothermal synthesis: the 

isotypical [Ln(Hpmd)(H2O)] materials [where Ln
3+

 = Eu
3+

 (1), Gd
3+

 (2) and Tb
3+

 (3)] were 

isolated in very good yields, at 40 ºC under just 5 seconds of reaction time, while standard 

hydrothermal conditions required 180 ºC and a period of 72 h. MWAS exhibited also good 

reproducibility, the possibility to prepare MOF materials with homogeneous crystal 

morphology and different particle sizes (ranging from nano- to micro-sized particles), 

while maintaining their crystal structure.  

The bench “one-pot” approach permitted the isolation of phase-pure 1D 

[La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)12] (4) and 2D [La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)2] (5)  materials, and also the 

3D [La2(H2pmd)3(H2O)2] (7) and [La2(H2pmd)(pmd)(H2O)4] (8) compounds. This latter 

material was, however, contaminated with other crystalline phases. “One-pot” synthesis 

also allowed the preparation of the porous MOF 29 at milder reaction conditions (60 ºC for 

24 h) when compared with the conventional solvothermal method (140 ºC for 48 h). In 

short, the bench “one-pot” and MWAS approaches exhibited themselves as potential and 

suitable synthetic alternatives to prepare MOFs in a simple and usually faster way with 

low-energy consumption.  

 As mentioned in Chapter 1 the preparation of phosphonate-based MOFs is usually 

not straightforward, mainly because the synthesis usually leads to microcrystalline 

powders, many of the times composed of mixtures of phases. In addition, the final 

structure of this type of materials is also less predictable than when carboxylate or N-donor 

organic ligands are employed in the self-assembly process with, for example, transition 

metals. This occurs mainly because the phosphonate organic linkers have several 

coordination modes (as demonstrated abundantly in the various MOF structures reported in 

this thesis) which allied with the typical high coordination numbers of lanthanides boost 

the occurrence of supramolecular isomerism. In Chapters 5 and 6 the addition of controlled 

amounts of an aqueous solution of HCl (6 M) promoted the isolation of phosphonate-based 

MOFs as large single crystals, ultimately avoiding the production of only microcrystalline 

powders.

[Eu(Hpmd)(H2O)] (1),  [(La0.97Eu0.03)(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]·3H2O (10), [(La0.95Eu0.05)2-

(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]·H2O (24) and [(La0.95Eu0.05)(H3tftp)(H2O)] (27), and the Tb

materials  [Tb(Hpmd)(H2O)] (3) [(La0.97Tb0.03)(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]·3H2O (11), 

[(La0.95Tb0.05)2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]·H2O (25) and [(La0.95Tb0.05)(H3tftp)(H2O)] (28) were 

investigated. On the one hand, the Tb
3+

-based materials exhibited always higher absolute 

quantum yields than their Eu
3+ 

analogue materials. This demonstrates that the organic

ligands employed are suitable sensitizers of Tb

 via the energy transfer process called 

antenna effect, leading to the isolation of intense green-emitting materials. On the other 

hand, the suppression of the O?H quenchers, as mentioned in Chapter 1, by deuteration or 

dehydration processes improved significantly the photoluminescent properties of some 

Eu
3+

-based materials. The effect of the replacement of the C?H quenchers by C?F moieties 

in the photoluminescent properties of the fluorinated MOFs reported in this thesis did not 

lead to conclusive results. 

The heterogeneous catalytic activity of the [Eu(Hpmd)(H2O)] (1), 

[La(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]·3H2O (9) and [La2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]·H2O (20) materials in the 

ring-opening reaction of styrene oxide (PhEtO) with methanol was investigated. 

Compounds 1, 9 and 20 showed to be truly heterogeneous catalysts and to exhibit excellent 

regioselectivity towards 2-methoxy-2-phenylethanol, which is always the sole reaction 

product. Compounds 9 and 20 can be recycled by simple and efficient regeneration 

processes. A comparative study between the catalyst 1 and its nanocrystalline form 1n 

revealed that the latter exhibited much higher catalytic activity than 1 toward the 

conversion of PhEtO. This is, probably, related with the small particle size of 1n compared 

with the microcrystalline phase. The catalytic activity of 20 increases from the first to the 

second and third catalytic runs promoted by the breaking of larger crystals into smaller 

ones. This feature may lead to an increase in the number of effective active sites and, 

consequently, increases the catalytic performance of the material, coming in line with that 

observed for 1n. To summarize, it was found that 9 has higher catalytic activity 

(conversion of 100% of PhEtO toward the product 2-methoxy-2-phenylethanol at 55 ºC in 

only 30 min) than 1, 1n and 20. This outstanding catalytic activity is related with the 

amount of the active sites of 9 that are likely to be of Brönsted type. 

A search in the literature reveals that some copper and iron-containing MOFs used 

as catalysts in the same reaction have relatively high PhEtO conversions reached at shorter 

reaction times and lower reaction temperatures. Nevertheless, for these transition-metal 

MOFs selectivity toward MeOPhEtOH was always less than 100%.

 Layered 

[La(H3nmp)] led to 76% yield.

 2D or 3D [La(L)] led to 100% yield at 4 h.

 The nano-

sized HKUST-1 led to 90% of conversion at 40 ºC for 2.5h.
4
 Compound 9 represents, until 

now, the most outstanding catalytic activity in the ring-opening reaction of PhEtO with 

methanol. 

The performance of the porous MOF 29 was investigated in gas separation 

processes. This compound, after activation (desolvation), exhibited the capacity to separate 

propane over propylene, although not with 100% of purity, during a certain period of time. 

The separation of acetylene over carbon dioxide was not achieved. However, after some 

preliminary screening tests concerning the preparation of the ion-exchanged material 

[Y(H3L)]·xSolvent_K (32) it was observed that acetylene was indeed separated (with 

almost 100% of purity) over carbon dioxide. The inclusion of the K
+
 cations into the 

framework of 29 led to a higher ability of this compound to retain CO2.

8.1. General Characterization Methods 
 

SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) images were acquired using either a Hitachi 

S4100 field emission gun tungsten filament instrument working at 25 kV or a high-

resolution Hitachi SU-70 working at 4 kV. Samples were prepared by deposition on 

aluminium sample holders followed by carbon coating using an Emitech K950X carbon 

evaporator. EDS (Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy) data and SEM mapping images 

were recorded using the same microscope, Hitachi SU-70, working at 15 kV and using a 

Bruker Quantax 400 or a Sprit 1.9 EDS microanalysis system. 

Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out using a Shimadzu TGA 50, 

from ambient temperature to ca. 800 ºC, with a heating rate of 5 ºC/min under a continuous 

stream of air at a flow rate of 20 mL min-1. 

Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectra (in the range 3750-350 cm-1) were 

recorded as KBr pellets (typically 2 mg of the sample were mixed in a mortar with ca. 200 

mg of KBr) using a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer by averaging 200 scans at a maximum 

resolution of 2 cm-1. 

Elemental analyses for C and H were performed with a Truspec Micro CHNS 630-

200-200 elemental analyzer at the Department of Chemistry, University of Aveiro. 

Analysis Parameters: sample amount between 1 and 2 mg; combustion furnace temperature 

= 1075 ºC; afterburner temperature = 850 ºC. Detection method: carbon - infrared 

absorption, hydrogen - infrared absorption. Analysis time = 4 minutes. Required gasses: 

carrier - helium, combustion – oxygen, pneumatic – compressed air. 

Routine Powder X-Ray Diffraction (PXRD) data for all materials were collected at 

ambient temperature on an X’Pert MPD Philips diffractometer (Cu K?1,2 X-radiation, ?1 = 

1.540598 Å; ?2 = 1.544426 Å), equipped with an X’Celerator detector and a flat-plate 

sample holder in a Bragg-Brentano para-focusing optics configuration (45 kV, 40 mA). 

Intensity data were collected by the step-counting method (step 0.04º), in continuous mode, 

in the ca. 5 ? 2? ? 50º range. 
13C CP MAS and 1H or 31P HPDEC MAS spectra were recorded at 9.4 T on a 

Bruker Avance 400 wide-bore spectrometer (DSX model) on a 4 mm BL cross-

polarization magic-angle spinning (CPMAS) VTN probe at 100.6 and 161.9 MHz, 

respectively. For the 13C{1H} CP MAS spectra the Hartmann-Hahn (HH) “sideband” 

matching condition ?1

1H

 + n?R (n = ±1) was carefully matched by calibrating the 
1H 

and the 13C rf field strengths; recycle delay: 3 s; contact time: 2 ms; ?R= 15 kHz. For the 
31P HPDEC spectra a 90° single pulse excitation of 3.5 µs was employed; recycle delay: 60 

s; ?R= 15 kHz. Chemical shifts are quoted in parts per million (ppm) with respect to TMS 

for 1H and 13C nuclei, and to an 85% H3PO4 solution for the 
31P nucleus. 

1H, 13C, 31P and 19F liquid NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker AVANCE 

300 spectrometer at 300.13, 75.47, 121.49 and 282.40 MHz, respectively. Deuterated 

chloroform (CDCl3) or dimethylsulfoxide-d6 (DMSO-d6) were used as solvents. 

Tetramethylsilane, H3PO4 (85%) or hexafluorobenzene were used as internal references. 

Chemical shifts (?) are quoted in ppm and the coupling constants (J) in Hz.

Mass spectra were collected using a Micromass Q-TOF2 equipment. Dichloromethane, 

water or methanol were used as solvent to dissolve the organic ligands as well as their 

precursors. The employed concentration was 1 mg mL-1. Samples were diluted in methanol 

to a concentration of 2 µL (sample)/200 µL (methanol). 

 

 

8.2. Reagents and Solvents 
 

Chemicals were readily available from commercial sources and were used as 

received without further purification: lanthanide (III) chloride hydrates LnCl3·xH2O (where 

Ln3+ = La3+, Ce3+, Pr3+, Nd3+, Eu3+, Gd3+, Tb3+, Dy3+, Ho3+, Er3+, Tm3+, Yb3+, 99.9%, 

Sigma-Aldrich); tetraethyl 1,4-phenylenebis(methylene)bisphosphonate (C16H28O6P2, 

&gt;95%, TCI Europe); 1,3,5-tris(bromomethyl)benzene (C9H9Br3, 97%, Sigma-Aldrich); 

1,3,5-trifluorobenzene (C6H3F3, 98%, Alfa Aesar); chloromethyl methyl ether (C2H5ClO, 

technical grade, Sigma-Aldrich); triethyl phosphite [(C2H5O)3P, 98%, Sigma-Aldrich];

(NaOH, ?98%, Sigma-Aldrich); potassium hydroxide (KOH, 85% p.a., Riedel-de Haën). 

 

 

8.3. Single-Crystal X-ray Diffraction Studies 
 

Single crystals of the organic molecules IL2, IL3, IL4, H6tftp and H6L, and the 

materials 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26 and 29 were manually harvested from the reaction 

vessel and immediately immersed in highly viscous FOMBLIN Y perfluoropolyether 

vacuum oil (LVAC 140/13, Sigma-Aldrich) to avoid degradation caused by the 

evaporation of the solvent. Crystals were mounted on Hampton Research CryoLoops with 

the help of a Stemi 2000 stereomicroscope equipped with Carl Zeiss lenses.1 The selection 

of a suitable single-crystal for analysis was a challenging task because they frequently 

presented cracks. Because of this, several data sets were collected, and the crystal model 

herein presented corresponds to the best solution that could be found. Data were collected 

on a Bruker X8 Kappa APEX II CCD area-detector diffractometer (Mo K? graphite-

monochromated radiation, ? = 0.71073 Å) controlled by the APEX2 software package2 and 

equipped with an Oxford Cryosystems Series 700 cryostream monitored remotely using 

the software interface Cryopad.3 Images were processed using the software package 

SAINT+,4 and data were corrected for absorption by the multiscan semi-empirical method

implemented in SADABS.5 The structure was solved using the Patterson synthesis 

algorithm implemented in SHELXS-97,6, 7 which allowed the immediate location of the 

two crystallographically independent La3+ centres and most of the heaviest atoms 

belonging to the organic linkers. The remaining non-hydrogen atoms were located from 

difference Fourier maps calculated from successive full-matrix least-squares refinement 

cycles on F2 using SHELXL-97.7, 8 All the non-hydrogen atoms were successfully refined 

by assuming anisotropic displacement parameters. 

 

 

8.4. Structural Determination: Laboratory Powder X-ray 

Diffraction 

 

Conventional powder X-ray diffraction data for the bulk materials 1, 2, 3, 8 and 12, 

suitable for structural refinements were collected at ambient temperature on a X’Pert MPD 

Philips diffractometer (Cu K?1,2 X-radiation, ?1 = 1.540598 Å and ?2 = 1.544426 Å), 

equipped with a X’Celerator detector and a flat-plate sample holder in a Bragg-Brentano 

para-focusing optics configuration (40 kV, 50 mA).  Intensity data were collected by the 

step-counting method (step 0.02º), in continuous mode, in the ca. 4 ? 2? ? 110º range. 

Powder patterns were readily indexed with DICVOL04,9 thus unequivocally 

confirming the assumed structural similarities with compounds [Ce(Hpmd)(H2O)] and 

[Pr(Hpmd)(H2O)] previously reported by the MOF research group at the University of 

Aveiro.10 Rietveld structural refinements11 using as starting premise the atomic coordinates 

of the aforementioned structures were performed with FullProf.2k.12, 13 Background was 

corrected using fixed points throughout the entire angular range determined by the linear 

interpolation between consecutive (and manually selected) breakpoints in the powder 

pattern. Cauchy profile functions, along with two asymmetry correction parameters, were 

selected to generate the line shapes of the simulated diffraction peaks.  The angular 

dependence of the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of individual reflections was also 

taken into account by employing a Caglioti function correction.14 

 

  

8.5. Variable-Temperature Powder X-ray Diffraction 
 

Variable-temperature powder X-ray diffraction data for [La(H3tftp)(H2O)] (1) were 

collected on a D8 Advance Bruker diffractometer (Cu K ?1,2 X-radiation, ?1 = 1.540598 Å; 

?2 = 1.544426 Å) under air atmosphere, equipped with a LynxEye detector, curved 

graphite-monochromated radiation, a flat-plate low background  Si wafer (911 oriented) as 

sample holder in a Bragg-Brentano para-focusing optics configuration (40 kV, 50 mA), 

and a high-temperature Anton Parr HTK1200 chamber. Intensity data were collected in the 

step mode (0.02º) in the range ca. 5 ? 2? ? 50º.  Data were collected between ambient 

temperature and 1000 ºC.

8.6. Photoluminescence Spectroscopy 
 

Emission and excitation spectra were recorded on a Fluorolog-2® Horiba Scientific 

(Model FL3-2T) spectroscope, with a modular double grating excitation spectrometer 

(fitted with a 1200 grooves/mm grating blazed at 330 nm) and a TRIAX 320 single 

emission monochromator (fitted with a 1200 grooves/mm grating blazed at 500 nm, 

reciprocal linear density of 2.6 nm·mm-1), coupled to a R928 Hamamatsu photomultiplier, 

using the front face acquisition mode. The excitation source was a 450 W Xe arc lamp. 

Emission spectra were corrected for detection and optical spectral response of the 

spectrofluorimeter and the excitation spectra were corrected for the spectral distribution of 

the lamp intensity using a photodiode reference detector. Time-resolved measurements 

have been carried out using a 1934D3 phosphorimeter coupled to the Fluorolog®-3, and a 

Xe-Hg flash lamp (6 µs/pulse half width and 20-30 µs tail) was used as the excitation 

source. The variable temperature measurements were performed using a helium-closed 

cycle cryostat with vacuum system measuring ~5×10-6 mbar and a Lakeshore 330 auto-

tuning temperature controller with a resistance heater. The temperature can be adjusted 

from 11 to 450 K. 

The absolute emission quantum yields were measured at ambient temperature using 

a quantum yield measurement system C9920-02 from Hamamatsu with a 150 W Xenon 

lamp coupled to a monochromator for wavelength discrimination, an integrating sphere as 

sample chamber and a multi-channel analyzer for signal detection. Three measurements 

were made for each sample so that the average value is reported. The method is accurate to 

within 10%. 

 

 

8.7. Heterogeneous Catalysis 
 

A 5 mL borosilicate batch reactor, equipped with a magnetic stirrer (800 rpm) and a 

valve for sampling, was charged with the catalysts 1, 1n, 9 and 20 (or with the organic 

ligands H4pmd or H6bmt, or lanthanide precursors EuCl3·6H2O and LaCl3·7H2O), 1.5 mL 

of methanol and 0.4 M of styrene oxide (PhEtO). The reaction was carried out under 

atmospheric air, with the batch reactor immersed in an external thermostated oil bath (35 

or 55 ºC). Prior to reuse, the solid catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture by 

centrifugation, washed with methanol and dried at 55 ºC (under atmospheric air). Leaching 

tests were carried out by heating a suspension of the catalyst (fresh or used) in methanol 

for 1 h at 35 or 55 ºC (under agitation), subsequently filtering the solid at 35 or 55 ºC 

through a 0.20 µm PVDF w/ GMF Whatman membrane, and finally adding PhEtO to the 

filtrate and monitoring the reaction of PhEtO at 35 or 55 ºC, under agitation.  

The progress of the catalytic reactions was monitored using a Varian 3900 GC 

equipped with a capillary column (SPB-5, 20 m × 0.25 mm) and a flame ionization 

detector (using mesitylene as an internal standard). The identification of the reaction

product was carried out by GC-MS (Trace GC 2000 Series (Thermo Quest CE 

Instruments) - DSQ II (Thermo Scientific)), using He as the carrier gas. 

 

 

8.8. Adsorption Studies 
 

8.8.1. Gas Adsorption Measurements 

Conventional adsorption isotherms were measured using a Micromeritics Tristar 

3000 volumetric instrument under continuous adsorption conditions. 

Brunauer?Emmet?Teller (BET) were carried out to determine the total specific surface 

areas for the N2 and CO2 isotherms at 77 and 195 K, respectively. In addition, CO2 

isotherms at 195 K were measured to evaluate the micropore region by means of the 

Dubinin?Radushkevich equation. Prior to measurement, the powdered material 29 was 

outgassed to 10?6 Torr and heated at 423 K for 7 h. 

 

8.8.2. Variable-Temperature Pulse Gas Chromatography 

Gas-phase adsorption at zero coverage surface was studied using the pulse 

chromatographic technique, employing a gas chromatograph (Varian 450-GC) equipped 

with a home-made chromatographic column, with 0.4 cm internal diameter and 29 cm of 

length. The columns was packed with ca. 0.543 g of the powdered material 29. For the 

activation of the materials, a He flow (20 mL min?1) was passed through the column at 423 

K during approximately 4 h. Later, 0.6 mL of equimolecular gas mixtures of C2H2/CO2/H2 

and C3H6/C3H8/H2 were injected at 1 bar on a He flow (20 mL min
?1). The separation 

performance of the chromatographic column was then examined at different temperatures 

(273?403 K) by means of a mass spectrometer gas analysis system (Pfeiffer Vacoon), 

detecting ion peaks at m/z 44 (CO2 and C3H8), 42 (C3H6), 26 (C2H2), 4 (He) and 2 (H2). 

The dead volume of the system was calculated using the retention time of hydrogen as a 

reference. 

 

8.8.3. Breakthrough Experiments for Gas Separation 

The chromatographic column, prepared as detailed in the section above, was 

activated under a pure He flow (20 mL min?1) at 423 K during approximately 4 h and then 

used for evaluating the N2/CO2, N2/C3H8, N2/C3H6, C3H8/C3H6, CH4/CO2/C2H2 and 

N2/CO2/C2H2 separation performances of the material 29. The desired gas mixture (20 mL 

min?1) was prepared via mass flow controllers. For instance, N2/CO2 (0.85:0.15) mixtures 

were prepared to simulate the emission of flue gas from a power plant employing 3 mL 

min?1 of CO2 and 17 mL min
?1 of N2 flows, and the breakthrough experiments were 

carried out at different temperatures (273-323 K) by step changes from He to N2/CO2 flow

8.9.1. 1,4-Phenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid (H4pmd) 

 

Tetraethyl 1,4-phenylenebis(methylene)bisphosphonate (500 mg, 1.32 mmol) was 

added to an aqueous solution of HCl (30 mL, 6 M). The reaction mixture was kept under 

constant magnetic stirring and heated to reflux. The evolution of the reaction was 

controlled by TLC and stopped after approximately 20 h, when the hydrolysis was 

complete. Impurities were successfully eliminated via a liquid/liquid extraction with 

dichloromethane. Water was then removed under reduced pressure, and the final 

compound, 1,4-phenylenebis(methylene)diphosphonic acid (H4pmd), was obtained in 

quantitative amounts (yield of about 96%).

8.9.2. (Benzene-1,3,5-triyltris(methylene))triphosphonic acid (H6bmt) 

 

A mixture of 1,3,5-tris(bromomethyl)benzene (0.3 g, 0.84 mmol) and triethyl 

phosphite (5 mL) was allowed to react under nitrogen atmosphere and at 120 ºC for 

approximately 12 h. After cooling to ambient temperature the excess of triethyl phosphite 

was removed by distillation under reduced pressure. The resulting orange oil residue was 

dissolved in dichloromethane and the intermediate IL1 was purified by flash column 

chromatography using a mixture of dichloromethane and methanol (95 : 5) as eluent. IL1 

was isolated as a colorless oil in 88% yield. Intermediate IL1 (0.47 g, 0.89 mmol) was 

transferred into an aqueous solution of HCl (30 mL, 6 M) and the reaction mixture was 

then refluxed for approximately 20 h under continuous magnetic stirring. The reaction 

product was washed with dichloromethane and the aqueous phase was distilled under 

reduced pressure. The resulting compound, (benzene-1,3,5-triyltris(methylene))-

triphosphonic acid (H6bmt), was recovered as a white solid by vacuum filtration and was 

washed with copious amounts of acetone. Yield: 92%.

To a mixture of 1,3,5-trifluorobenzene (0.60 g, 4.54 mmol) and chloromethyl 

methyl ether (6.58 g, 81.7 mmol, 18 eq.), anhydrous AlCl3 (10.90 g, 81.7 mmol, 18 eq.) 

was slowly added for about 10 min, under nitrogen atmosphere and at 0 ºC. This step was 

accompanied with the formation of an orange precipitate. The mixture was stirred at 0 ºC 

for 10 min and then at 40 ºC for approximately 7 h. The final dark brown solution was 

poured onto ice and stirred overnight. A liquid/liquid extraction was performed using 

dichloromethane. The organic phase was then neutralized with a saturated solution of 

NaHCO3 and dried over anhydrous NaSO4. Dichloromethane was distilled under reduced 

pressure and the final oily residue was purified by flash column chromatography using 

petroleum ether / dichloromethane (4:1) as eluent. The target compound, 1,3,5-

tris(chloromethyl)-2,4,6-trifluorobenzene (IL2), was obtained as a microcrystalline white 

powder in 71% yield (0.90 g). 

A mixture of IL2 (0.94 g, 3.40 mmol) and triethyl phosphite (15 mL) was refluxed 

under nitrogen atmosphere for approximately 3 h. After cooling to ambient temperature, 

the excess of triethyl phosphite was distilled under reduced pressure (Caution! triethyl 

phosphite has an extremely unpleasant smell and it is harmful; it should be, therefore, 

always handled inside a fume hood). The resulting oily residue was dissolved in 

dichloromethane and the desired compound, hexaethyl((2,4,6-trifluorobenzene-1,3,5-

triyl)tris(methylene))tris(phosphonate) (IL3), was purified by flash column 

chromatography using a mixture of dichloromethane / methanol (95%:5%) as eluent. IL3 

was isolated as a microcrystalline white powder in 75% yield (1.49 g). 

To IL3 (1.70 g, 2.92 mmol) an aqueous solution of HCl (110 mL, 6M) was added, 

and the resulting reaction mixture was refluxed for approximately 20 h under continuous 

magnetic stirring. The reaction product was washed with dichloromethane and the aqueous 

phase was distilled under reduced pressure. The desired compound, ((2,4,6-

8.9.4. Large tripodal phosphonate ligand H6L 

  

A mixture of 1,3,5-tris(4-bromophenyl)benzene (300 mg, 0.552 mmol), [Pd(PPh3)4] 

(20 mg, 0.017 mmol) and triethyl phosphite (2 mL, 11.7 mmol) was prepared inside a 10 

mL IntelliVent microwave reactor. The reaction mixture was kept inside a CEM Focused 

Microwave Synthesis System Discover S-Class equipment, under constant magnetic 

stirring (controlled by the microwave equipment), employing an irradiation power of 120 

W for 20 min. The initial reaction temperature was 230 ºC (achieved by using a weflon 

stirring bar), starting to decrease when the pressure inside the reactor reached 100 psi (limit 

value selected). The close control of the temperature inside the reactor was ensured with a 

constant flow of air (ca. 20-30 psi of pressure). After the reaction, the excess of triethyl 

phosphite was removed under reduced pressure and the crude product was purified by flash 

column chromatography using dichloromethane/methanol (97%:3%) as eluent. The 

resulting yellowish and viscous oily residue was washed with petroleum ether in an 

ultrasonic bath and the target organic intermediate IL4 was obtained, as a white powder, in 

83% yield. 

 The IL4 intermediate (1.30 g, 1.82 mmol) was added to an aqueous solution of 

concentrated HCl (50 mL, 12 M) and the resulting reaction mixture was refluxed, under 

constant magnetic stirring, for approximately 48 h. The reaction was completed with the 

precipitation of a brownish viscous residue (Attention! During the reaction occurs the 

formation of an intermediate white precipitate being then dissolved). After cooling to 

ambient temperature, the reaction mixture was washed with dichloromethane and the 

resulting residue was dissolved in methanol, being then distilled under reduced pressure. 

The resulting brownish viscous residue was redissolved with dried methanol and a mixture 

of dried toluene and dried hexane (1:1) was added. The solvents were distilled under 

reduced pressure. The resulting residue was dried under vacuum affording a yellowish 

foam, which was dissolved in a small amount of dried methanol (2-3 mL) occurring then 

the precipitation of the desired H6L compound as a white powder (yield of 93%).

were transferred to Teflon-lined Parr Instrument reaction vessels and then placed inside a 

MMM Venticell oven.  Reactions took place at 180 ºC over a period of 72h, after which 

time the oven was turned off and the samples cooled slowly to ambient temperature (while

8.10.1.2. Microwave-Assisted Hydrothermal Synthesis 

A mixture containing 0.2034 g of EuCl3·6H2O (or TbCl3·6H2O) and 0.1477 g of 

H4pmd was prepared at ambient temperature in distilled water (ca. 6 mL), with an overall 

molar ratio of ca. 1 : 1 : 600 (Eu3+ : H4pmd : H2O), directly inside a 10 mL IntelliVent 

microwave reactor.  The reaction mixture was kept under constant magnetic stirring 

throughout the synthesis which occurred inside a CEM Focused Microwave Synthesis 

System Discover S-Class equipment.  A constant flow of air (ca. 10 psi of pressure) 

ensured a close control of the temperature inside the reactor.  Parameters varied during the 

reaction: temperature (40, 50, 60, 70, 90, 120 and 150 ºC) and irradiation (50 W power) 

time (5 s, 30 s, 1 min and 5 min).  The final product was recovered by vacuum filtration,

washed with abundant amounts of distilled water and then air-dried at ambient 

temperature. 

 

8.10.1.3. [Ln(Hpmd)(H2O)] materials as isolated nanoparticles 

Mixtures of respective lanthanide (III) chloride hydrate (LnCl3·xH2O, Ln
3+ = Eu3+ 

or Tb3+), with H4pmd in distilled water (ca. 6 mL), were kept under magnetic stirring at 

ambient temperature for approximately 1 min. The resulting homogeneous reactive 

mixtures were submitted to ultrasound irradiation. The supernatant suspension was 

separated by decantation and the solid product was recovered by vacuum filtration. Both 

the suspension and the recovered solid were the subject to further characterization in order 

to confirm the presence of either [Eu(Hpmd)(H2O)] (1) or [Tb(Hpmd)(H2O)] (2). 

The following experimental conditions were systematically varied in order to 

optimize the synthetic conditions aiming at isolating separated nano-particles: 

(i) Temperature: ambient temperature, 60 and 70ºC; 

(ii) Reaction time (ultra-sound irradiation): 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 20 or 30 min; 

(iii) Composition of the reactive mixtures: Ln3+ : H4pmd : H2O molar ratios of 

about 1 : 1 : 600, 1 : 1 : 1200, 1 : 1 : 1800, 1 : 1 : 3600 or 1 : 1 : 7200. 

Isolated nanoparticles of 1 were obtained when the reaction was performed at ambient 

temperature, during 5 minutes of ultrasonic irradiation with a molar ratio of the reactive 

mixture of about 1 : 1 : 7200.  Identical nanoparticles of compound 2 were isolated using 

similar experimental conditions. 

 

8.10.1.4. Theoretical Calculations 

Ab initio calculations were performed using the G03w package15 on the 

multiprocessor cluster Flamingo belonging to CICECO, University of Aveiro. Partial 

optimized geometries, harmonic vibrational frequencies and intensities were obtained at 

the B3LYP level using the Los Alamos Effective Core Potentials plus double-zeta basis set 

(LanL2DZ option of G03). The basis set for phosphorus was extended with a d function. 

We have observed from the crystallographic studies that the structural and 

vibrational features remain constant for the investigated lanthanides. Assuming that the 

lanthanum-based compound is isostructural, and because this metal is more convenient due 

to the absence of f electrons, the crystal structure of the praseodymium-based compound 

was used as a model with the praseodymium atoms being substituted by lanthanum.10  

The whole framework was divided in three independent model structures 

corresponding to the phosphonate, hydrogenophosphonate and water ligands. Each one of 

these moieties, and the respective metal center, were allowed to be optimized inside a box 

of fixed atoms. Each model structure was further divided into layers: one layer corresponds 

to one of the ligands and the metal, and was set free in the optimization; the other layer is 

composed by the neighboring atoms up to a distance of about 2 Å from those of the central 

layer. These layers were built from the real crystallographic data, using the Diamond 

software package.16 The partial optimization, with the internal layer free and the other 



Experimental Section 

263 
 

layers fixed, led to fragments very similar analogous in the crystal structure. The 

theoretical spectrum of the structure was obtained by adding the three fractional spectra. 

 

8.10.2. Lanthanum-Biphosphonate Coordination Polymers Isolated by 

Microwave-Assisted and One-Pot Synthesis 

 

8.10.2.1. Microwave-assisted synthesis  

Mixtures of H4pmd (0.1477g, 0.55 mmol) and water (ca. 6 mL) were stirred at 

ambient temperature inside a 10 mL IntelliVent microwave reactor for ca. 5 min. 

LaCl3·7H2O (0.2061 g, 0.55 mmol) was then added obtaining an overall molar ratio of ca. 

1:1:600 (La3+:H4pmd:H2O) for the reactive mixture. The resulting homogeneous 

suspension was placed inside a CEM Focused Microwave™ Synthesis System Discover S-

Class equipment and was kept under constant magnetic stirring (controlled by the 

microwave equipment). A constant flow of air (ca. 20-30 psi of pressure) ensured a close 

control of the temperature inside the reactor.  

Synthetic conditions were investigated by systematically varying the experimental 

parameters: (i) temperature (30, 35, 40, 50, 60, 70, 90, 120 and 150 ºC); (ii) power (10, 25 

and 50 W); (iii) irradiation time (1, 3, 5 and 10 min).  

After reacting, a white precipitate was obtained, and the final product was 

recovered by vacuum filtration, followed by washing with abundant amounts of distilled 

water, and then air-dried. 

 

8.10.2.2. One-Pot Synthesis 

 For a typical metal:ligand molar ratio of 1:1, a mixture containing ca. 0.1 mmol of 

an aqueous LaCl3·xH2O solution (5 mL of ca. 20 mmol/L solution) and ca. 5 mL of an 

aqueous solution of H4pmd (0.0254 g, 0.0954 mmol) was homogenized in a round-bottom 

flask with constant magnetic stirring. The resulting solution was heated to the desired 

temperature and kept stirring during the required time, leading to the formation of a white 

precipitate. After cooling, the obtained solid product was centrifuged for 20 min at 3500 

rpm, using a SIGMA 2-5 equipment, or filtrated under vacuum, washed with copious 

amounts of distilled water and ethanol, and allowed to air dry at room temperature. 

As performed for the microwave-assisted approach, a systematic variation of the 

experimental conditions was performed by changing the following parameters: (i) 

La3+:H4pmd molar ratios (1:1, 1:2 and 2:1); (ii) temperature (room temperature, 40, 60 and 

80 ºC); (iii) reaction time (10, 20, 30 and 60 min).

8.11.1.1. Microwave-Assisted Hydrothermal Synthesis 

A reactive mixture composed of 0.0666 g of H6bmt and 0.1374 g of LaCl3·7H2O in 

ca. 6 mL of distilled water, with a molar ratio of ca. 2 : 1: 1800 (La3+ : H6bmt : H2O), was 

prepared at ambient temperature inside a 10 mL IntelliVent microwave reactor. Reactions 

took place inside a CEM Focused Microwave Synthesis System Discover S-Class 

equipment, under constant magnetic stirring (controlled by the microwave equipment) by 

employing an irradiation power of 50 W. A constant flow of air (ca. 20-30 psi of pressure) 

ensured a close control of the temperature inside the reactor.  

Synthetic conditions were investigated by systematically varying the experimental 

parameters: (i) temperature (40, 60, 90, 100, 120 and 150 ºC) and (ii) irradiation time (1, 

15 and 30 min).  

The resulting products, [La(H4bmt)(H5bmt)(H2O)2]·3H2O (9) and the known 

[La2(H3bmt)2(H2O)2]·H2O (20), as white powders, were recovered by vacuum filtration, 

washed with copious amounts of distilled water and then air-dried at ambient temperature. 

Isotypical materials containing stoichiometric amounts of optical centers, 3% of 

Eu3+ (10) and 3% of Tb3+ (11), were prepared using a similar procedure to that described 

above (at 60 ºC for 5 minutes) using the required amounts of the corresponding lanthanide 

chloride salts.

8.11.3.1. Hydrothermal Synthesis 

Mixtures of the respective lanthanide (III) chloride hydrates [LnCl3·nH2O, where 

Ln3+ = La3+ (20), Ce3+ (21), Pr3+ (22), and Nd3+ (23)] and H6bmt were prepared in distilled 

water (ca. 6 mL) with a molar ratio of approximately 1:2:1800 (H6pmt:Ln
3+:H2O), 

respectively (for 20: 0.0666 g of H6bmt were reacted with 0.1374 g of LaCl3·7H2O). The 

mixtures were kept under constant magnetic stirring and atmospheric conditions for 

approximately 30 min. The resulting suspensions were transferred to Teflon-lined Parr 

Instrument autoclaves and placed inside a pre-heated MMM Venticell oven where they 

remained at 180 ºC for a period of 72 h. After reacting, the vessels were allowed to cool 

slowly to ambient temperature and the resulting materials (typically white microcrystalline 

powders) were recovered by vacuum filtration, washed with abundant amounts of distilled 

water and air-dried at ambient temperature.

The mixed-lanthanide materials with 5% of Eu3+ (24) or 5% of Tb3+ (25) dispersed 

in a La3+ matrix were prepared following the aforementioned procedure while adjusting the 

amounts of the lanthanide chloride salts to the desired amounts.

 A solution of YCl3·6H2O dissolved in 1 mL of distillated water was added to a 

solution composed of the large tripodal organic ligand H6L, 1 mL of distillated water, 3 

mL of methanol and 5 mL of an aqueous solution of HCl (6 M). The mixture was kept 

under constant magnetic stirring during approximately 1 min at ambient temperature. The 

resulting homogeneous suspension was transferred to a Teflon-lined Parr Instrument 

autoclave and then placed inside a MMM Venticell oven according to the following 

temperature program: 48 h (from ambient temperature to 140 ºC), 24 h (isothermal at 140 

ºC) and 48 h (cooling to 30 ºC). The resulting material 29 was recovered by vacuum 

filtration as large single-crystals, being then washed with copious amounts of distilled 

water and then air-dried at ambient temperature.
