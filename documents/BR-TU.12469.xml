Resumo O estatólito, análogo aos otólitos, tem-se revelado como um instrumento 
importante para a determinação da idade e para estudos de crescimento em 

invertebrados. Localiza-se dentro dos orgãos de equilíbrio, os estatocistos. 

Apesar de terem sido já bem estudados na classe Cephalopoda, pouco se 

sabe atualmente sobre a sua estrutura, composição química e possível uso 

para esclerocronologia na classe Gastropoda. O presente trabalho propõe 

caracterizar o estatólito em diferentes espécies de gastrópodes, desde os que 

habitam o ambiente marinho, água doce e terrestre. Procurou-se descrever a 

localização do estatocisto nas diferentes subclasses e a diversidade de 

estatólitos existente nesta classe. Verificou-se que nas subclasses 

Patellogastropoda, Vetigastropoda e Heterobranchia, as espécies apresentam 

múltiplas estatocónias no interior do estatocisto, que nestes casos se localiza 

entre os gânglios pedais e pleurais. Na subclasse Caenogastropoda as 

espécies analisadas apresentam o estatocisto  localizado em posição dorsal, 

sob os gânglios pedais, e apresentam um estatólito por estatocisto. O facto das 

espécies da subclasse Caenogastropoda terem um estatólito em vez de 

estatoconia, faz com que estas espécies tenham um maior interesse para 

estudos de esclerocronologia. 

O estatóltio dos gastrópodes é uma estrutura aproximadamente esférica de 

carbonato de cálcio. No seu interior apresenta anéis concêntricos descritos 

como sendo possíveis anéis de crescimento. Verificou-se que na espécie 

Nucella lapillus o estatólito aumenta proporcionalmente de tamanho com o 

crescimento do animal, desde o embrião até a fase adulta.  

É descrita pela primeira vez a composição química do estatólito de Nassarius 

reticulatus por microanálise com microssonda eletrónica ao longo do raio do 

estatólito.  Os principais elementos químicos presentes são: cálcio (Ca), 

oxigénio (O), estrôncio (Sr), sódio (Na) e enxofre (S). 

 

 

  



  

  
 

Resumo (cont.) 

 
Como o estatólito acompanha o crescimento do indivíduo pode guardar inscrito 

em si um importante registo químico característico do meio em que o animal 

está inserido, desde o seu nascimento e até ao momento de análise. No 

entanto, no presente estudo não foram detetadas diferenças significativas nas 

concentrações dos elementos químicos acima referidos ao longo do raio do 

estatólito, nos diferentes incrementos analisados, nem foi observado qualquer 

padrão elementar indicativo de sazonalidade na deposição dos elementos ao 

longo do raio do estatólito.

Statolith, Statoconia, Statocyst, Gastropods 

 

Abstract The statolith, analogous to the otolith, has been shown to be an important tool 
for age estimation and growth studies. The statolith is located inside a special 

chamber named statocyst. The statocyst is the organ of balance of most 

invertebrates, and is present in a wide range of taxonomic groups of 

invertebrates. Although there is plenty of research regarding the 

statoliths/statocysts in the class Cephalopoda, there is a surprising lack of 

information regarding this structure in the Gastropoda. This work intends to 

characterize the statolith in gastropods, and assess the diversity of statoliths in 

this class. It was found that in subclasses Patellogastropoda, Vetigastropoda 

and Heterobranchia, species present multiple statoconia inside the statocyst, 

which is located between the pedal and pleural ganglia; in turn, in subclass 

Caenogastropoda, the analyzed species present a single statolith in each 

statocyst and the statocyst is located dorsally under the pedal ganglia. The fact 

that species of subclass Caenogastropoda have one statolith instead of 

statoconia makes them more useful for sclerochronology studies. 

The gastropod statolith is a spherical structure of calcium carbonate that 

presents concentric rings. Although these concentric rings are reported has 

growth rings, the statolith ontogeny is not completely known. It was verified that 

in Nucella lapillus the statolith increases in diameter followins the growth of the 

animal from the embryo to maturity.  
For the first time, it was described the chemical composition of the statolith of 

Nassarius reticulatus adults by electron probe microanalysis. The major 

elements found in statoliths were calcium (Ca), oxygen (O), strontium (Sr), 

sodium (Na) and sulfur (S). 



  

  
 

Abstract (cont.) 

 
The statolith increments deposition follow the growth of the animal throughout life 

and may probably provide an important register of the chemical characteristics of 

the environment in which the animal live, throughout ontogeny. However, this 

work could not reveal any significant differences in these elements 

concentrations throughout the statolith radius (between increments), neither 

evidences of any particular pattern on the occurrence of elements periodical 

cycles in the statolith rings.

Chapter 1 - Introduction 

 

If we would ask to a common person to list the main types of senses (or sensory 

modalities) of humans, the most probable answer would be the sight, hearing, touch, 

smell and taste, which represent the “five senses” concept of Aristotle lost in the 

antiquity. In fact, people can easily name a body part used for each of these senses as 

they can see or feel their eyes, ears, skin, nose and tongue, and they can recognize the 

use of each of them to explore specific properties of objects in the surrounding 

environment. If we would then ask them to explore a set of objects spread in a given 

space they would move to get close to the objects and should recognize that they were 

using another crucial sense that helps them to orientate and to control their equilibrium. 

In fact, while moving they feel accelerations in many directions (top/bottom, front/back, 

right/left) and they keep postural control in relation to gravity. This further sense is 

provided by a specific mechanoreceptor organ located in the human inner ear that 

provides perception of acceleration and position (see Figure 1).  

 

Figure 1. Inner ear: Cochlear and Semicircular canals. According to the movement of the body, otoconia move within 

the semicircular canals. Adapted from Hain 2011. 

 

The type of georeceptor organ described above is ubiquitous in the living world 

and has evolved since the dawn of life on earth. In plants (see Figure 2), the plastids, 

known as amyloplasts, act for sensing gravity (Morita 2010).  



8 

 

 

Figure 2. Left: Root structure. Amyloplasts are visible in columella cells in the root cap. Right: Structure of the 

columella cell, showing the nucleus (N), vacuole (V), amyloplast (A), and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Adapated from 

Morita 2010. 

Even free living cells like the protists are able to perceive gravity either by 

intracellular receptors (statocyst like organelles, see below), heavy cell organelles (such as 

the nucleus) and/or by sensing the cell mass by means of ion channels located in the cell 

membrane (Bräucker et al. 2002). An evolved georeceptor organ appears in metazoans. 

The simplest form of this organ - the statocyst - occurs in the invertebrates and consists of 

a chamber containing a free solid granule or a mass of cohering grains, generally 

designated as statolith. The displacement of the statolith due to changes in the position 

of the animal stimulates local sensory cells, indicating the body position in respect to 

gravity. This organ has developed considerably through evolutionary progression from 

invertebrates to vertebrates and despite great differences in its ontogeny and structure, 

the physical principle of functioning remained basically the same.  

The simplest metazoans showing statocysts are the Cnidaria and the Ctenofora. For 

instance, the scyphozoan jellyfishes possess statocysts within club-shaped structures 

called rhopalia, which are distributed along the margins of the swimming bell. In each 

rhopalia a tubular piece of tissue hangs free with a statocyst at its terminal edge. Dense 

aggregations of nerve tissue are associated with the rhopalia and control the rhythmic 

contraction of the swimming bell. When the animal tilts in a given direction the statoliths 

stimulates certain sensory cilia. This generates action potentials in associated nerve cells 

that will trigger contractions of the bell in order to re-establish the vertical posture 

(Pechenik 1996). The Ctenofora is another group of animals at about the same level of 

organization than cnidarians, popularly known as sea-gooseberries or comb-jellies 



9 

 

(Fretter and Graham 1976) that possess one apical statocyst (Hickman et al. 2006) that 

also functions as a gravity sense organ. The same general type of statocysts are present in 

most of other invertebrates, such as annelids, crustaceans, molluscs, echinoderms, 

tunicates, etc. (Fretter and Graham 1976; Purchon 1977; Barnes 1980), though the 

microstructure and shape of the statocyst varies amongst taxa. The statolith may consist 

of a single or multiple small calcareous concretions (e.g. molluscs) or cohering sand grains 

(e.g. crustaceans) (Fretter and Graham 1976). They may even consist of diatom shells and 

quartz grains covered by chitinous material in some polychaete families (Barnes 1980). 

Statocysts may also present a closed structure (e.g. molluscs) or may retain an opening to 

the exterior (e.g. crustacean). In the latter case, the grains of sand that lie inside the 

statocyst of crustaceans, which function as statolith, are lost in each molt and new ones 

are picked up through the statocyst opening after ecdysis (Hickman et al. 2006). Although 

in most invertebrate taxa statocysts typically present a simple saclike appearance, in 

cephalopods they are more complex and show an amazingly close resemblance to 

vertebrate organs (e.g. semicircular canals in Octopus spp.) (Anken and Rahmann 2002). 

The most evolved equilibrium sense organs definitively occur in vertebrates. Inner ears of 

vertebrates present three looping semicircular canals perpendicular to each other for the 

detection of angular acceleration (or rotation of the head) plus three chamber containing 

otoliths or statoconia in lower vertebrates (utricle, saccule and lagena for the perception 

of linear acceleration/gravity and sound) or two chambers with statoconia and a 

lagena/cochlea without a otolith or statoconia for sound perception in higher vertebrate 

animals. In the above chambers there are patches of sensory and supportive cells called 

macula. The macula is associated to underlying sensory neurons and in the opposite side 

has a cupula that is made heavy by deposits of calcareous material: in fishes these 

deposits can form a solid mass (the otolith) while in amphibians, reptiles, birds and 

mammals the deposits remain as hundreds of thousands minute calcium carbonate 

cristals (the statoconia or otoconia). When the head of the animal moves, the otoliths or 

otoconia tend to slide over the macula in response to gravity, producing a force to which 

hair cells are sensitive and allow the detection of postural position and acceleration 

(Hildebrand 1974; Anken and Rahmann 2002).

Besides the general interest that the above mentioned equilibrium sense organs 

may represent for physiology, ethology, taxonomy and other areas of biological science, 

the present dissertation aims to explore the usefulness of gastropod statoliths for 

sclerochronology. The sclerochronology is a field of science dedicated to the study of 

physical and chemical variations in calcified structures of organisms (e.g.: fish otoliths, 

bones and scales, mollusc shells, corals, etc.) and the temporal context in which they 

form. It is central for age estimation and growth analysis in studies of biology and 

fisheries management, to deduce organism life history traits or to reconstruct records of 

environmental and climatic change through space and time. Barroso et al. (2005) 

demonstrated that statoliths of adult gastropod molluscs can be used in 

sclerochronology. Based on samples collected from the seacoast of Aveiro (Portugal), 

these authors showed that the gastropod species Nassarius reticulatus possesses two 

statocysts, each containing a spherical statolith of calcium carbonate of up to 0.22 mm in 

diameter that can provide information about the age and growth of this species. 

Richardson et al. (2005a, b) showed that the gastropods Neptunea antiqua and Polinices 

pulchellus possessed similar statoliths that could be used for age determinations. Later, 

Chatzinikolaou and Richardson (2007) corroborated the results obtained by Barroso et al. 

(2005) for N. reticulatus collected from United Kigdom seacoast. 

The application of adult gastropod statoliths in sclerochronology is recent and may 

present many advantages comparing to the most traditional organisms that have been 

used in marine sclerochronology such as fish, bivalves cephalopods and corals. One 

advantadge is the fact that gastropods are sedentary or poorly mobile organisms, unlike 

fish or cephalopods, and so they can describe the physical-chemical composition of the 

marine environment in a particular location along time. A second advantage is the fact 

that, unlike the shells of bivalves or gastropods, the statoliths are internal structures that 

are protected from erosion and mechanical/chemical stress and so they can register 

accurately information on the marine environment and can also provide good age 

estimations. Many aspects are still unexplored in the literature, namely if statoliths can be 

universally used for describing the age and growth in class Gastropoda. This is important 

because in most gastropod species the outer shell surface has few rings that can be used 



11 

 

reliably for age estimation and their detection in the conical spired shells of gastropods is 

complicated without serial sectioning. The annual rings present in gastropod statoliths 

may overcome these difficulties as demonstrated by Barroso et al. (2005), Richardson et 

al. (2005a, b) and Chatzinikolaou and Richardson (2007). In this dissertation it is 

pretended to advance furthermore this topic with the attempt to relate the rings 

observed in the statolith through visual/image analysis with the chemical analysis of the 

statolith, assuming that seasonal variation of chemical fingerprints may provide a good 

validation of the observed annual rings. 

The general objective of this thesis is to contribute to the advance of the 

techniques in sclerochronology and to improve our understanding regarding the diversity 

and the microstructure of gastropod statolith. The specific objectives are: (i) to provide a 

comprehensive characterization of the type, shape, microstructure and chemical 

constitution of the statoliths in class Gastropoda, and to (ii) improve and expand the use 

of statoliths for age and growth assessments in class Gastropoda. The thesis is organised 

in four chapters. Chapter 1 (the current one) is the general introduction of the theme of 

the thesis, where the main objectives of the work are defined. Chapter 2 characterizes 

the diversity of statoliths that occur in different species of gastropods collected in Aveiro 

(NW Portugal) and the adjacent seacoast. Chapter 3 describes the chemical composition 

of statoliths of Nassarius reticulatus and addresses its usefulness for age determinations 

and environmental monitoring. Chapter 4 states the major conclusions of the current 

work and prospects complementary work to be developed in the future.

Chapter 2 – Gastropod statocyst diversity 

2.1. Introduction 

The Mollusca is the second largest phylum of the kingdom Animalia and one of its 

most diverse groups with about 200,000 living species (Ponder and Lindberg 2008). In 

terms of number of species, Gastropoda is considered the major class of Mollusca (80% of 

all molluscs are gastropods) due to the great evolutionary radiation suffered, and is also 

the second largest class of the animal kingdom. This group is generally characterized by 

having a single shell, an operculum and a larvae undergoing torsion. Gastropods vary in 

external shape, size, behavior, anatomy and physiology, and show an almost global 

distribution, from marine and freshwater to terrestrial environments (Campbell 2008; 

Ponder and Lindberg 2008). 

 

2.1 .1 . Gas tropod systema tics  

To better understand the diversity of statocysts and statolith/statocconia in 

gastropods, it is first necessary to describe the biodiversity in class gastropoda and clarify 

the taxonomic nomenclature here adopted.  The gastropods biodiversity has been 

traditionally grouped into three subclasses – Prosobranchia, Opisthobranchia and 

Pulmonata – following Milne-Edwards's (1848). Thiele (1929-31) (see Figure 3) adopted 

Milne-Edwards’s (1848) classification but further subdivided the Prosobranchia into three 

orders: Archaeogastropoda, Mesogastropoda, and Stenoglossa (this last one renamed 

Neogastropoda by Wenz 1938-44) (Franc 1968; McArthur and Harasewych 2003).  



14 

 

 
Figure 3. Gastropod classification after Thiele (1929-1931). The gastropod class was divided into three subclasses: 

Prosobranchia, Opisthobranchia and Pulmonata. The subclass Prosobranchia was divided into three orders: 

Archaeogastropoda, Mesogastropoda and Neogastropoda. 

 

This was until recently the main classification accepted and followed in most 

textbooks. However, gastropods classification has evolved in the recent years due to: (i) 

the discover of new taxa, especially in deep-sea environments; (ii) the rapid increase of 

new data provided by new morphological and molecular techniques; and (iii) the 

development of new methodologies for data analysis and phylogenetic hypotheses 

generation (McArthur and Harasewych 2003; Ponder and Lindber 2008).  

One important change to the above classification (hereafter designated as “old 

classification”) was proposed by Yonge’s (1947) that divided the Aspidobranchia 

(prosobranchs with bipectinate ctenidia) into four groups: (i) true limpets (now described 

as Patellogastropoda), (ii) ancient marine snails (now described as Vetigastropoda), (iii) 

caenogastropods and (iv) neritoideans. Although the position of these groups has 

changed in the following years, the main contribution of this scheme was the recognition 

of the neritoideans (equivalent to Neritimorpha).  

Other major modification to the old classification was proposed by Cox (1960) and 

consisted in the unification of the mesogastropods and neogastropods into a new group 



15 

 

named Caenogastropoda, which now comprises about 60% of living gastropod species. In 

terms of rank, Cox (1960) treated Caenogastropoda as an order, while Ponder and 

Lindberg (1997) (see below) and Bouchet and Rocroi (2005) (see below) treated 

caenogastropods as an unranked major clade comprising the majority of the 

Mesogastropoda of Thiele (1929–1931) and all of the Neogastropoda, whilst several 

groups (Architectonicoidea, Rissoellidae, Omalogyridae, Pyramidellidae, Valvatidae) 

previously included in Mesogastropoda are now included in Heterobranchia.  

Another important change to the old classification was the recognition made by 

Golikov and Starobogatov (1975) that the true limpets (now described as 

Patellogastropoda) represent a distinct group from the remaining gastropods. 

Subsequently, Ponder and Lindberg (1995) grouped the gastropods into two main 

subclasses: (i) the Eogastropoda, that include the true limpets (Patellogastropoda) and 

ancestors; and (ii) the Orthogastropoda that are split among the Vetigastropoda, 

Cocciliniformia, Neritimorpha, Caenogastropoda and Heterobranchia (the latter includes 

the Opisthobranchia and Pulmonata)(see Figure 4).  

 

 
Figure 4. Gastropoda classisifcation after Ponder and Lindberg 1995. The class Gastropoda was first divided into two 

main divisions Eogastropoda (= Patellogastropoda), and Orthogastropoda. Orthogastropoda includes all the other 

gastropods. 

 



16 

 

Bouchet and Rocroi (2005) (see Figure 5) recognized the monophyly of the six 

groups scheme of Ponder and Lindberg (1995) although they consider that there are no 

synapomorphies that reliably group any of these lineages. These authors proposed slight 

changes in this systematics, including the elimination of the split between Eogastropoda 

and Orthogastropoda as in Ponder and Lindberg (1997), and recognizes six main groups: 

Patellogastropoda, Neritimorpha, Cocculiniformia, Vetigastropoda, Caenogastropoda 

(which, in the initial classification, all together constituted the subclass Prosobranchia) 

and Heterobranchia (combining the previous Pulmonata and Opisthibranchia subclasses). 

In the Bouchet and Rocroi (2005) classification the higher taxa are expressed as unranked 

clades, and groups where monophyly (a single lineage) is not proved are termed 

"informal groups". 

 
Figure 5. Gastropoda classification after Bouchet and Rocroi (2005). The class Gastropoda was divided into six 

monophyletic groups. 

Subsequent revisions by other authors have been made since the publication of 

the above paper but this dissertation will be based hereafter on the taxonomy proposed 

by Bouchet and Rocroi (2005), following the adaptations performed by Gofas (2011a) that 

are adopted in the official site of the World Register of Marine Species 

(www.marinesepecies.org). Main changes adopted by Gofas (2011a) on the Bouchet and 



17 

 

Rocroi (2005) scheme consisted in adding Linnean ranks above superfamily in order to 

allow to follow hierarchical levels after a number of branchings and also to better 

quantify how deep diversification goes (Figures 5 and table 2). 

 

2.1 .2 . Location,  structur e and func tion of  gastropod statocys t  

2.1 .2 .1 . Sta tocyst locat ion   

Gastropods statocysts are intimately connected to the nervous system. The 

nervous system structures, including pedal, pleural and cerebral ganglia, are connected 

and form a ring around the esophagus (Figure 6). 

 

Figure 6. Gastropod central nervous system (schematic dorsal view, not to scale). Cg: cerebral ganglion; E: 

oesophagus; Ey: eye; Plg: pleural ganglion; Pg: pedal ganglion; S: statocyst. Adapted from Neusser et al. 2009. 

The statocysts are intimately associated with the nervous ganglia (Fretter and 

Graham 1962) and frequently connected to the cerebral ganglia through a fine sensory 

nerve that runs alongside the cerebro-pedal connective nerve (Hyman 1967; Zaitseva 

1994; Balaban 2011). The statocyst nerve spreads over the surface of the vesicular wall 

and presumably terminates in sensory cells (Hyman 1967).  The precise location seems to 

vary from species to species as their description in the literature is rather variable. In 

infraclass Pulmonata the statocyst is a transparent vesicle that can reach 480 µm and is 



18 

 

located in the cerebro-pedal connective nerves of pedal ganglia (Stahlschmidt and Wolff 

1972; Zaitseva and Bocharova 1981; Zaitseva 1994, 2001). However, according to Chase 

et al. (2002) opisthobranchs and pulmonates have the statocysts located on the dorso-

lateral surface close to the pleural ganglion, while in the remainder gastropods they are 

located on the ventral side of the pedal ganglia. The statocyst position in several 

gastropod species is described in table 1.

endolymph or statolymph (Mckee and Wiederhold 1974; Hyman 1967). The statocyst wall 

consists of an outer layer of connective tissue and an inner flattened epithelium (Hyman 

1967). The epithelium contains small supporting cells carrying microvilli and giant sensory 

hair cells (receptor cells) (Fretter and Graham 1962; Stahlschmidt and Wolff 1972; Gao 

and Wiederhold 1997; Chase 2002; Tsirulis, 1974 in Levi et al. 2004). Gastropods can have 

receptor cells type 1 (“Prosobranchs”), type 2 (Opisthobranchs and Pulmonates) or both 

types (Opisthobranchs); receptor cells type 1 are morphologically polarized and have the 

basal feet of the cilia project in the same direction; receptor cells type 2 are 

morphologically nonpolarized, and the basal feet of the cilia of this hair cell are radially 

oriented and are most often oriented centripetally with the cilia arranged in a ring (See 

Salley 1986). 

In Opisthobranchia infraclass the statocyst diameter varies with the size of the 

animal and may reach 200 µm (Wiederhold et al. 1989; Ohsuga et al. 2000; Zaitseva 

2001). Each statocyst contains 10–13 disk-shaped receptor cells (or mechanoreceptor 

cells (Mckee and Wiederhold 1974; Pedrozo et al. 1996)), the number of receptor cells 

varies from species to species in the Heterobranchia subclass (Ohsuga et al. 2000). The 

receptor cells are separated from each other by layers of small supporting cells 

(Wiederhold et al. 1989; Pedrozo et al. 1996; Ohsuga et al. 2000; Zaitseva 1994; Zaitseva 

2001). 

In the caenogastropod Pomacea paludosa the statocyst can reach a diameter of 

400-450 µm and contain approximately 2500-3000 small receptor cells (Stahlschmidt and 

Wolff 1972; Gao and Wiederhold 1997). Each receptor cell has 30-40 cilia and is 

surrounded by 6 supporting cells (Stahlschmidt and Wolff 1972). In gastropods, the 

receptor cells carry (9+2)-type kinocilia with about 0,2 µm in diameter and 15-20 µm long 

(Stahlschmidt and Wolff 1972; Mckee and Wierderhold 1974; Gao and Wiederhold 1997; 

Balaban et al. 2011). These cells send their axons into a nerve, called the “static nerve” or 

statonerve, which connects to the cerebral ganglion (Stahlschmidt and Wolff 1972; Mckee 

and Wiederhold 1974; Wiederhold et al. 1989; Ohsuga et al. 2000; Barker 2001; Zaitseva 

2001; Chase 2002; Campbell et al. 2008). The receptor cells cilia are in direct contact with 



21 

 

the statocyst cavity (Zaitseva 2001). Statocysts contain inside the lumen a single statolith 

or statoconia (Balaban et al. 2011). Upon stimulation of cilia by statoliths or statoconia, 

there are substances that are activated in specific locations in the statocyst, that function 

as statocysts sensory transmitters to the cerebral ganglia (see Ohsuga et al. 2000; Balaban 

2011). Electrophysiological studies conducted by Jance (1988) demonstrated that 

catecholamines play an important role in the efferent innervation of statocyst by central 

nervous system neurons (Jance et al. 1988 in Zaitseva 2001). 

 

Figure 7. Statolith and Statoconia. A: Statolith of Nassarius reticulatus showing the external appearance and the 

concentric layers or rings that can be observed when statolith is grinded down to the centre (here represented in just 

one quarter of the statolith), adapted from Barroso et al. 2005. Scale bar 50µm. B: Interior wall of statocyst with 

three statoconia and several cilia of Helix lucorum, extracted from Gorgiladze et al. 2010. Scale bar 10 µm. 

 

The gastropod statolith is generally a spherical mass of calcium carbonate. The 

statolith is formed by the periodically deposition of increments (Franc 1968) and often 

shows concentric rings, perhaps due to rhythms in the animal’s growth (Fretter and 

Graham 1962; Maggenti 2005) (see figure 7a). These rings have been used for age 

estimation in larvae (Grana-Rafucci and Appeldoorn 1997) and adult caenogastropods 

(Barroso et al. 2005, 2011; Richardson et al. 2005a, 2005b; Chatzinikolaou and Richardson 

2007). The statoconia is constituted by several smaller spherical masses also of calcium 

carbonate (Figure 7b).  Vast majority of statoconia have an ellipsoidal shape in 

Opisthobranhia infraclass that can vary between 3-20 µm in Aplysia sp (Wiederhold et al. 



22 

 

1989), and in Pulmonata infraclass have an oval shape structure and can vary between 2-

3 µm in diameter (Gorgiladze et al. 2010). The statoconia have a central nucleus and the 

number of layers surrounding it increase with increasing statoconium size (statoconia 

with an irregular form can have 2 nucleus) (Gorgiladze et al. 2010). In Aplysia sp., the 

animals starts with a single statolith (in larval stage) and reaches up to 1000 statoconia in 

adult life. This indicates that statoconia are added to the cyst lumen during development 

(Mckee and Wiederhold 1974; Wiederhold et al. 1989; Chase 2002).  

 

2.1.2.3. Statocysts function 

The statocyst of molluscs was first described as a sense organ, in 1887, by the 

French zoologist Yves Delage (Franc 1968). Subsequent experimental work carried out by 

different researchers confirmed that statocysts are organs of balance allowing most of 

the invertebrates to sense gravity and to maintain the equilibrium (Hyman 1967; Franc 

1968; Mckee and Wiederhold 1974; Wierderhold 1989; Gao and Wiederhold 1997; 

Maggenti 2005; Campbell et al. 2008; Gorgiladze et al. 2010). Through behavioral 

experiments, especially statocyst extirpation experiments, it was possible to discover that 

statocysts of molluscs control various behavioural reactions, like geotaxis (Lever and 

Genze in Hyman 1967; Levi et al. 2004), maintenance of equilibrium (Morton 1979) and 

compensatory reactions (Barker 2001; Zaitseva 2001; Levi et al. 2004). All these findings 

prove the ability of the statocyst to use gravitational stimuli to spatially orient the body 

with respect to the vertical axis of gravity (Salley 1986). 

Statoliths and statoconia move freely inside the statocyst under the influence of 

gravity (Mckee and Wiederhold 1974; Levi et al., 2004). Inside the statocyst the 

continuous beating of the mechanosensory cilia keeps the statoconia in constant motion 

(Pedrozo et al. 1996). Gravity pulls the statoconia down, obstructing the beating of the 

cilia on the bottom of the statocyst, which causes an increase in membrane conductance 

to Na+ and the formation of an action potential, generating a nervous signal and 

activating the sensory cells (Wiederhold 1976; Gallin and Wiederhold 1977; Zaitseva 

1994; Pedrozo et al. 1996; Chase 2002). However, in gastropods, no response is given by 



23 

 

either acceleration or deceleration, and the statocyst only senses the gravity direction 

(Chase 2002).  

In genus Aplysia the cerebral ganglia receive information from the statocyst to 

regulate body movement activity (Salsnki et al. cited in Zaitseva 2001). Wiederhold (1989) 

described that the receptor cells of Aplysia sp. statocysts react to a tilted table, 

generating action potencials. These action potentials are carried by the statocyst nerve to 

the cerebral ganglia in order to convey information about animal orientation (Gallin and 

Wiederhold 1977; Wiederhold 1989). It is well established now that the response of 

receptor cells with respect to gravity is what determines the spatial orientation in 

gastropods (Gao and Wiederhold 1997). Because of its relatively simple structure, the 

statocyst of Heterobranchia subclass has been used as a model for zoology studies 

regarding the basic principles and interactions between the vestibular system and other 

sensory systems in vertebrates during the formation of adaptive behavior (Zaitseva 2001). 

 

2.1 .2 .4 . Sta tocyst on togeny  

The ontogeny and the mechanisms of elemental deposition of gastropods 

statoliths and statoconia are still poorly known. It is consensual that statocysts are 

formed very soon during gastropod embryonic development and are functional in the 

beginning of the larval stage.  

Loyd (2008) reported that in the caenogastropod Kelletia kelleti the statocysts and 

respective statoliths are formed approximately within the 2 weeks after egg capsules are 

laid. D’Asaro (1965) refer that in the caenogastropod Strombus gigas statocysts begin to 

form in “four day old” embryos and are functional by day six. According to Muley (1978), 

the two statocysts are the most striking features in the trochophore stage (origin of 

different organs and organ system can be traced from this stage). However, in N. lapillus 

(caenogastropod), the statocysts appears in the beginning of the veliger stage (Muley 

1978; Stöckmann-Bosbach 1988; Dickinson and Croll 2003). Then, the statocysts lie close 

to the pleural-pedal ganglia though they are innervated by nerves from the cerebral 



24 

 

ganglia (Fretter and Graham 1962). In none of these works, on N. lapillus, is referred 

when the statocyst start to develop a statolith.  

In the opisthobranch Aplysia sp. statocysts arise 10 days after fertilization, when 

the animals hatch (Wiederhold 1989). However, Bidwell et al. (1986) described the 

presence of a statolith in normal 5 day embryos (Bidwell et al. 1986 cited in Wiederhold 

1989) 

 Gorgiladze et al. (2010) refer that the statoconia in the pulmonate Helix lucorum 

are formed by deposition of growth layers of mineral and organic materials. These 

authors found inside the statocyst, apart from statoconia, spherical formations between 

kinocilia with only 0.3-2.5 µm in diameter that may correspond to the nuclei of future 

statoconia. Afterwards, the supporting cells secrete the mineral component that 

sediments in the form of growth layers around the nuclei (Gorgliladze et al. 2010). 

There are some substances known to be required for the statolith and statoconia 

production. Pedrozo et al. (1996) suggest that urease and carbonic anhydrase are 

required for statoconia formation and that they are important for regulation of statocyst 

pH in cultured statocysts (Pedrozo et al. 1996). Campbell and Speeg (1969) proposed that 

ammonia, produced as a consequence of urease activity, can facilitate the biological 

deposition of calcium carbonate by acting as a proton acceptor (Campbell and Speeg 

1969; Pedrozo et al. 1996). Strontium is also required to obtain normal development of 

molluscan statoconia (Wiederhold et al. 1989).  

The statocysts ontogeny in the opisthobranchs is quite different from other 

gastropods because in this group larvae presents a single statolith in the statocyst whilst 

adults possess multiple statoconia (McKee and Wiederhold 1974; Chia et al. 1981; 

Wiederhold 1989; Wiederhold et al. 1990. The statolith is retained till the metamorphosis 

and afterwards statoconia begin to be produced (Wiederhold, 1974;  Wiederhold  et  al. 

1986).This indicates that statoconia are added to the cyst lumen during development 

(Wiederhold 1989). Statoconia production reaches the highest level immediately after 

metamorphosis and then it slows down throughout the rest of animals’s life (Wiederhold  

et  al. 1990).

2.2. Objectives 

The main objective of this chapter is to describe the diversity of statoliths and 

statoconia among several aquatic and terrestrial gastropod species collected in Aveiro 

(NW Portugal). Besides the general interest in comparing these structures between 

different species, namely in what regards to their size and external appearance, the 

ultimate goal is to inspect the clearness of the rings they may possess and their potential 

interest for sclerochronology studies.  

 

 

2.3.Materials and Methods 

 

2.3 .1  Statocon ia vs  stato li ths: the d iversity  wi thin c lass gastropoda  

Samples of marine gastropods were collected by hand in Ria de Aveiro (Aplysia sp, 

Calliostoma zizyphinum, Crepidula fornicata, Gibulla cineraria, Gibulla umbilicallis, 

Littorina littorea, Monodonta lineata, Nassarius incrassatus, Nucella lapillus, Ocenebra 

einacea, Ocinebrina aciculata, Trivia monacha  at Praia da Barra, 40º 31’ 05.90” N 8º 47’ 

05.11” W; Hydrobia ulvae at Gafanha da Nazaré 40º 37’ 16.43” N 8º 44’ 14.69” W) in 

November 2009, March 2010, and September 2011, during the low tide; species from 

genus Helix terrestrial gastropods were collected in March 2011 in a garden (Santa Joana 

40º 37’40.45’’ N 8 º 37’25.18’’ W). Aporrhais pespelecani, Charonia lampas, Nassarius 

reticulatus and Ranela olearium were obtained from the seacoast of Aveiro (10-30 m 

depth) in sampling surveys performed in 2006 and 2010 preserved frozen (-20ºC) 

thereafter. Specimens were frozen in the following 3-4 hours after collection and kept at -

20° till further analysis. Upon thawing, the shells were photographed and measured. The 

soft body of the animals was extracted from the shell. The anterior ventral surface of the 

body was dissected under a stereo-microscope to locate the statocysts. The statocysts 

were gently ruptured and the statoliths were removed with forceps. Statoliths were 

placed in a supersaturated NaOH solution for 3h. Subsequently, they were washed twice 



26 

 

in destilled water, and then dehydrated, first in ethanol 70% and then in 100%. The 

statoliths were then mounted in a glass slide with Eukit® resin. The statoliths were 

photographed under an optical microscope with a microscope camera (Motic 2300®). 

 

2.3 .2  Statocys ts location  and struc ture  

In order to observe the microscopic structure of the statocyst, we selected one 

gastropod species – Nassarius reticulatus - to perform histological preparations of this 

organ. Specimens were narcotized and afterwards the shells were cracked to remove the 

soft body. The tissues envolving the statocysts were extracted and were fixed in Bouin’s 

solution for 24h. A total of seven pairs of statocysts (obtained from seven animals) were 

embedded in paraffin, sectioned (7 µm) in a microtome (Leitz 1512, Wetzlar, Germany), 

stained with haematoxylin–eosin and mounted on a glass slide with EUKIT resin for light 

microscope observation. 

 

2.3 .3  Stato lith  morphology and onto logy  

So as to know more about the gastropod statolith ontogeny, one gastropod 

species Nucella lapillus (Linnaeus) was selected. Thus, in the laboratory, the embryonic 

development of these whelks was followed, from the capsule deposition to juvenile 

hatching, in order to define the moment when statocysts form and to study the 

respective morphology of the statolith. For that we collected adults of N. lapillus from 

Praia da Barra and placed them in aquaria with artificial seawater (Prodac®) of 35 

practical salinity units (psu), under constant aeration and at 18º C, for female spawning. 

Every day egg-capsules were removed from the aquaria and kept under the same 

conditions but separated by date. Once a week, capsules were opened, using a scalpel, 

and embryonic development was observed with a stereo-microscope and photographed 

with a digital camera (Moticam® 2300) adapted to the light microscope. 

In complement, N. lapillus of different sizes were collected in a sheltered beach 

(Marégrafo, Aveiro) in September 2011 and in an exposed beach (Costa Nova, Aveiro) in 

November 2011. In the laboratory the shells were measured and the statoliths were 



27 

 

removed from animals and prepared as described above. The statoliths were 

photographed with the digital camera (Moticam® 2300) adapted to the light microscope 

and all dimensions measured through image analysis using the Motic Images Plus 2.0® 

software. 

 

2.4. Results and Discussion 

 

2.4 .1 . Sta toconia vs s tatol iths:  the  diversi t y with in c lass gastropoda  

  

We collected 19 gastropod species from marine, freshwater and terrestrial 

environment. A wide diversity of taxonomic groups could be sampled, covering 4 

subclasses and 13 families: subclass Patellogastropoda (Family Patellidae), subclass 

Vetigastropoda (Families Calliostomatidae and Trochidae), subclass Caenosgastropoda 

(Families Calyptraeidae, Littorinidae, Hydrobiidae, Aporrhaidae, Ranellidae, Triviidae, 

Nassariidae and Muricidae,) and subclass Heterobranchia (infraclass Opisthobranchia, 

family Aplysiidae; infraclass Pulmonata, family Helicidae). The 19 gastropod species 

collected in this work are shown in figures 8-27 and their taxonomic position is listed in 

table 2.The taxonomic diversity of gastropods sampled in Aveiro, although relatively short 

in number of species, is reasonable good to represent the main trends in statocyst 

diversity in class gastropoda considering that it includes 4 of the main 6 clades of Bouchet 

and Rocroi (2005).

 This work shows that statoconia occurred in Patellogastropoda, Vetigastropoda 

and Heterobranchia, while Caenogastropods exhibited a statocyst with a single statolith. 

This is in good agreement with Fretter and Graham (1962), who stated that species from 

archaeogastropoda (accepted now as Patellogastropoda, Vetigastropoda and 

Neritimorpha subclasses), Valvatidae (Heterobranchia subclass) and also Viviparidae 

(Caenogastropoda subclass) have statoconia, while other mesogastropod and 

neogastropod families (most belonging now to Caenogastropoda subclass) have a single 

statolith in each statocyst. It should be noted however that, according to Hess et al. 

(2008), subclasses Cocculiniforma and Neritimorpha (not analyzed in this work) have a 

single statolith.  

Our findings also match the morphological criteria used to distinguish the 

hypsogastropoda that, among other diagnostic characters, present a single statolith in 

each statocyst rather than several statoconia (Ponder and Lindberg 2008). The 

“hypsogastropoda” was a term introduced by Ponder and Lindberg (1997) to include the 

“higher caenogastropods” of Healy (1988a), i.e., the great majority of extant 

caenogastropods (most “mesogastropods” and all neogastropods) or, in other words, all 

caenogastropods other than architaenioglossans, Cerithioidea, and Campaniloidea. This is 

in general accordance with the criteria defined by Fretter and Graham (1962) in the sense 

that these authors also exclude the Viviparidae (architaenioglossans) from the meso- and 

neogastropods as an exception for the statolith type, i.e., animals that possess statoconia 

instead of a single statolith. 

It seems that the presence of statoconia vs statolith could be used as a main 

distinguishing feature in gastropods classification. A clearly a distinction between 

subclasses Patellogastropoda, Vetigastropoda and Heterobranchia, altogether presenting 

statoconia, and the Caenogastropoda, presenting statoliths, is evident in figure 24.  

Though useful for systematics, we should avoid making for now any inference regarding 

the evolution history of statocysts in class gastropoda because it would be surprising to 

observe statoconia in heterobranchs and statoliths in caenogastropods. In fact, this 

character (statoconia vs statolith) could represent an important drawback to the 

hypothesis that consider these two subclasses as sister groups. Although Heterobranchia 



39 

 

has been regarded to be the sister group of Caenogastropoda by many paleontologists, 

some evidence suggests this may not be true (Ponder and Lindberg 2008). In fact, it has 

been difficult to construct a robust phylogenetic hypothesis for gastropod evolution as 

relationships among major gastropod clades vary significantly among analyses based on 

morphological and molecular data sets (see Aktipis et al. 2008). Other interesting aspect 

is that opisthobranchs show the peculiar feature of exhibiting a single statolith within 

each statocyst during the larval stage and multiple statoconia afterwards (Wiederhold et 

al. 1990; Chase 2002). Although this aspect deserves more study, we cannot reject the 

hypothesis that the statolith observed in the larval stage can in fact represent a single 

statoconium that evolves to a condition of multiple statoconia during ontogeny. 

Regardless the usefulness of using the statoconia vs statolith criteria for diagnostic 

proposals, phylogenetic interpretations or taxonomic rearrangements, one pragmatic 

conclusion of interest is that only statoliths have potential for sclerochronology and, 

consequently, only the higher caenogastropods (Hypsogastropoda) are of relevance in 

this respect. In fact, it does not seem reliable to use each single statoconium to track the 

passage of time if more and more are being continuously produced throughout gastropod 

live. In this sense, only the statolith can register a continuous passage of time since the 

birth of the animal untill the moment it stops growing. The remaining shelled gastropods 

can still be used for sclerochronology studies but only through the use of their shells. 

 

2.4 .2 . Sta tocysts  locat ion and s tructure  

The statocysts are transparent organs and it is possible to see where they are 

located due to the disctint presence of the statoliths or statoconia. The gastropods 

analysed presented statocysts close to the nervous ganglia but, as expected, in different 

positions depending on the species. For instance, in N. reticulatus (see figure 28) 

statocysts are close to the pedal ganglia, while in Patella sp, C. zizyphinum and Aplysia sp 

(see Figure 29, 30 and 31, respectively ) statocysts are between the pedal and the pleural 

ganglia, but closer to the pedal ganglia. In Helix sp statocysts are located on the side of 

the pedal ganglia (Figure 32).

 The histology of the statocysts in N. reticulatus (Caenogastropoda) did not allow 

an adequate identification of the cells that constitute the statocyst.  In fact, it is possible 

to observe two cells layers, in the interior of the cyst (Figure 33a and 33b), but it is not 

possible to identify the cells types (receptor and supporting cells) nor the cilia. Figure 30a 

shows the N. reticulatus statocyst without the statolith as it was removed by the 

microtome knife during cutting. The N. reticulatus statocyst with a statolith is shown in 

figure 30b. This statolith has been cut and this is just a part (less than a half) of the 

statolith. A statocyst with a statolith in figure 33c, but in this case a fresh unfixed and 

unstained preparation was made and photographed immediately after extraction from 

the animal where it can be observed the round structure and the transparency of the 

statocyst.

2.4 .3 . Sta tol ith morphology and  ontology  

 

As shown in figures 15-25 the morphology of statoliths is quite similar among the 

different species of Caenogastropoda. All of them have a more or less spherical shape and 

exihbit a hard translucent structure. As they are transparent it is possible to perceive the 

existence of several concentric layers of material that seems to be secreted with a given 

pattern during the animal’s live. These concentric layers are noticed in almost all 

statoliths (Figures 14-25) and, when observed in one dimension, they appear like a series 

of rings that can putatively result from a discontinuous growth rate of the animal. 

Between these conspicuous major rings it is possible to observe other tiny and smaller 

rings that apparently are formed by progressive deposition of calcareous and organic 

material during growth. If any of these rings result from annual, monthly, fortnightly or 

even daily increments of time induced by environmental and astronomical pacemakers, it 

is possible to use them to trace the passage of time, and here resides their potential value 

for sclerochronology. 

In order to better understand the growth and morphology evolution of the 

statolith, we followed the statolith development in one selected caenogastropod - N. 

lapillus – during the larval stage (retained in the egg capsule) and in adult live. N. lapillus 

is a predatory gastropod abundant and widespread on rocky shores in the North Atlantic. 

N.lapillus is dioecious, laying benthic capsules that each contains 15–30 shelled embryos. 

Crawling young emerge from the capsules and, as in other gastropods with direct 

development, the limited dispersal capability is correlated with pronounced spatial 

variability in shell morphology (Rolán et al.2004; Guerra-Varela et al. 2009; Galante-

Oliveira et al. 2011).  

It has been reported that the period between egg capsule deposition and juvenile 

hatching in this species may last about 4 months (Fretter and Graham 1962; Stöckmann-

Bosbach 1988; Pechenik et al. 1984). The embryos were observed once a week, but only 

in the 3rd week (after egg-capsule deposition) was possible to observe the statolith (Figure 



43 

 

34d). It was not possible to distinguish the organs that have developed in the embryos 

between the first and second week (Figure 34a and 34b, respectively) by direct 

microscope observation. In the 3rd week the statolith presented 3 rings (Figure 34d), 

which indicates that it was formed some time before, perhaps in the beginning of the 

second week. This has been confirmed for other caenogastropod, Kelletia kelleti (Loyd et 

al. 2008). 

 

 

Figure 34. Nucella lapillus ontogeny. A: Capsule with embryos in the first day. B: Capsule with embryos in the 

beginning of 2nd week. C: Embryo in the veliger stage. D: statolith of an embryo with 24 days. 

The monitoring of the continuous development of the statolith beyond the 

juvenile stage and up to the adult live would take a number of years, so we decided to 

analyze statoliths from a wide range of animal sizes in order to cover different ages. By 

this way it was possible to follow the growth of the animals (along the different cohorts) 

at both sampling sites (Marégrafo and Costa Nova), although the age could not be 

estimated. N. lapillus is known by presenting a polymorphism associated with the degree 

of wave exposure: exposed ecotypes are typically small, with relatively larger apertures 

and thinner shells than the sheltered ecotypes. In some localities the sheltered/exposed 

polymorphism reaches its maximum distinctness in sub-adults and then decreases with 



44 

 

ageing, probably because adults undergo shell erosion (Rolán et al.2004; Guerra-Varela et 

al. 2009). Despite the specific ecotype of this specie, no difference was found in the 

statolith between animals in these sites (Marégrafo and Costa Nova). We conclude that 

the morphology and external appearance of the statolith remained almost constant 

throughout the live of the whelks in what regards to the shape and occurrence of rings. 

The diameter of the statoliths increased with shell size (see figure 35) and the number of 

rings augmented proportionally. The same pattern was already reported for N. reticulatus 

collected from Aveiro by Barroso et al. (2005). This result confirms that the statolith 

increment follows the growth of the animal throughout life and may probably provide an 

important register of physical and chemical characteristics of the marine environment 

throughout ontogeny. They could thus serve as a tool for age estimation in N. lapillus as 

well as a possible archive of the environmental conditions that the whelks experienced 

through lifespan at a given site.

59 and 77 day of life. The line was adjusted visually and may not represent the real trend between the left (early 

development inside capsules) and right points (animals collected in the field). (*) indicates the time to hatch (approx. 

on 65th day). 

The statoliths of the diverse caenogastropods species collected in Ria de Aveiro 

appear to have the potential to be used in sclerochronology studies as: (i) they are easy to 



45 

 

collect; (ii) they grow along the animals life and form in the beginning of ontogeny; and 

(iii) they present a hard structure that may register the history of the animal throughout 

time. It is particularly interesting to note that they present rings that could be used to 

estimate the age of animals if they are produced with a given periodicity. For instance, if 

each ring observed in the statolith corresponds to the change of growth rate during every 

winter, their count could easily indicate the age of the gastropods in years. Most 

importantly, when the statolith is grinded to the centre it reminds a “music CD”. If any 

analytical technique could analyse the chemical composition of the statolith along the 

radius (from the center to the edge) perhaps we could detect and validate the number of 

rings if they correspond to seasonal variation of growth and confirm age. If 

bioaccumulation rate is taken into account it could be even possible to trace temporal 

evolution of environmental levels of given contaminants at a given site, which would 

represent a milestone to environmental monitoring science. Hence, after this preliminary 

approach to understand the diversity and general characteristics of statocysts and 

statoliths in class gastropoda, it is important to advance and explore new techiques that 

could allow the chemical analysis of the gastropod statolith, which is the subject of the 

next chapter.

Chapter 3 - The gastropod statolith chemical composition 

 

3.1. Introduction  

Statoliths are diverse amongst the Gastropoda class, namely regarding type, shape 

and microstructure, see chapter 2. These features have been addressed over time, mainly 

as part of studies on statocysts structure (e.g. McKee and Wiederhold 1974; Chia et al. 

1981; Gao and Wiederhold 1997; Gorgiladze et al. 2010), development (e.g. D'Asaro 

1965; Salley 1986; Wiederhold et al. 1990; Gao et al. 1997) and function (e.g. McKee and 

Wiederhold 1974; Gallin and Wiederhold 1977; Wiederhold et al. 1989). However, the 

scenario is different regarding statoliths chemical composition and hardly any reports, 

specifically on gastropods, can be found in the literature. 

 

3.2. The gastropod statolith mineral matrix 

 

 There are few studies on gastropods statoliths chemical composition and the 

available ones refer to a minority of species – statoconia in Helix lucorum (Gorgiladze 

2002) and Aplysia californica (Wiederhold et al. 1989; Pedrozo et al. 1997) – and mostly in 

larvae – statoliths in Strombus gigas (Salley 1986), Concholepas concholepas (Zacherl et 

al. 2003a) and Kelletia kelletii (Zacherl et al. 2003b; Zacherl 2005; Lloyd et al. 2008). 

Generally, a mineral matrix of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is referred for both statoconia 

and statoliths but its crystalline form as aragonite was only effectively tested for Helix 

lucorum (Gorgiladze 2002) and Aplysia californica (Pedrozo et al. 1997), both species 

presenting statoconia in adult life. However, embryonic and pre-metamorphic Aplysia 

contain a single statolith within each statocyst, evolving to statoconia during juvenile 

stage (Wiederhold et al. 1990). In this particular case, Pedrozo and co-authors (1997) 

showed that statolith and statoconia differ regarding crystalline composition: statoconia 

were proved to be aragonitic while statoliths were apparently of amorphous CaCO3. 

Despite this unique record, the assumption of an aragonitic matrix in statoliths is patent 

(Grana-Raffucci and Appeldoorn 1997; Zacherl et al. 2003a; Zacherl et al. 2003b; Zacherl 



52 

 

2005; Lloyd et al. 2008) possibly because the data on statoconia are on that direction 

(Pedrozo et al. 1997; Gorgiladze 2002) but also since detailed descriptions on the 

chemical composition of analogous structures are available in the literature and show the 

presence of aragonite crystals (For cephalopod statoliths composition see Radtke 1983; 

see the comprehensive revision on fish otoliths by Campana 1999). 

 Regarding elemental composition, the gastropod statolith is known to be 

dominated by the major chemical elements calcium (Ca), carbon (C) and oxygen (O) 

(Wiederhold et al. 1989; Pedrozo et al. 1997; Gorgiladze 2002; Barroso et al. 2005b), as 

expected because of the CaCO3 matrix. Nevertheless, the presence of minor (&gt;100ppm) 

and trace (&lt;100ppm) elements have been plainly reported for Aplysia californica 

(Wiederhold et al. 1989), Helix lucorum (Gorgiladze 2002), Strombus gigas (Salley 1986), 

Concholepas concholepas (Zacherl et al. 2003a) and Kelletia kelletii (Zacherl et al. 2003b; 

Zacherl 2005; Lloyd et al. 2008), (see Table 3).

 Small but significant amounts of chlorine (Cl), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), 

strontium (Sr) and sulfur (S) were reported as minor elements of A. californica statoconia 

by Wiederhold et al. (1989); no absolute values are indicated but the authors determined 

a Ca/Sr ratio of 97:1 ± 3 (mean ± standard error). Chlorine, potassium (K), Na, S and silicon 

(Si) ranged from 0.1 to 0.7% of the total weight fractions (1000 to 7000 ppm) in H. 

lucorum statoconia (Gorgiladze 2002). Chlorine, Mg, Na, phosphorous (P) and S were also 

detected in the inner matrix of a 0-10 days larval statolith of S. gigas (Salley 1986). Zacherl 

et al. (2003a) measured barium (Ba), lead (Pb), Sr and zinc (Zn) in Concholepas 

concholepas larva, presenting the results as element/Ca ratios, as it was also performed 

for Kelletia kelletii larva by: (i) Zacherl et al. (2003b) for Ba/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios; (ii) Zacherl 

(2005) for Ba/Ca, cerium (Ce)/Ca, Mg/Ca, manganese (Mn)/Ca, Pb/Ca, Sr/Ca and Zn/Ca; 

and (iii) Lloyd et al. (2008) for Ba/Ca, Mg/Ca, Mn/Ca, Pb/Ca, Sr/Ca and Zn/Ca. Thus, in 

summary and to date, the following elements were detected in gastropods statoconia 

and statoliths: Ba, C, Ca, Ce, Cl, K, Mg, Mn, Na, O, P, Pb, S, Si, Sr and Zn. 

 

3.3. Objectives 

The objective of this chapter is to characterize Nassarius reticulatus statolith 

elemental composition by using the Electron Probe Microanalysis (EPMA) technique. 

EMPA is a non-destructive approach for determining the chemical composition of 

complex solid materials (Castaing 1960) and proved to be the best method to accurately 

measure the most representative elements in fish otoliths (Campana et al. 1997). For this 

reason, it was used in the present work to characterise the general statolith elemental 

composition in N. reticulatus adults and by this way to perform a preliminary assessment 

regarding the possibility to: (i) detect annual growth rings that could be used to estimate 

the age of the animals; (ii) search for trace metal contamination that could be 

subsequently applied in environmental monitoring. 

 



54 

 

3.3 Material and methods 

One statolith from each of three adult specimens of Nassarius reticulatus were 

used to determine statolith elemental composition in this species by EPMA. Two animals, 

sampled at Aveiro seacoast (40°38’50’’N 8°47’08’’W), provided statoliths S.1 and S.2. One 

more specimen, collected inside Ria de Aveiro estuarine system (40°30’39.26’’N 

8°44’55.64’’W), provided statolith S.3. After sampling, animals were frozen and kept at -

20°C until further processing. Statoliths were extracted from thawed specimens, as 

described in chapter 2. In order to digest any remaining flesh tissue from the statocyst, 

each statolith was placed on a single concave glass slide and immersed in a drop of 

saturated sodium hydroxide (NaOH) during three hours. Then, NaOH was completely 

removed and substituted by distilled water. This washing step was repeated twice and 

followed by two similar steps for dehydration: at first by immersion in 70% ethanol and 

then in 100% ethanol. Afterwards, glass slides containing statoliths were placed inside an 

oven at 60°C to dry for about 5 minutes. 

 Dried statoliths were embedded in resin (EpoFix kit from Struers) and mounted in 

plain glass slides whose surface was previously sanded, washed with detergent, rinsed 

abundantly with water and cleaned with absolute ethanol, in order to increase adhesion 

of resin to glass. The resin was prepared by mixing the 2 constituents of the EpoFix kit in 

the proportion 8 EpoFix resin : 1 EpoFix hardener. To get rid of air bubbles formed while 

mixing, the resin was kept for 2 minutes inside an oven at 60°C and then left standing at 

room temperature for 15 minutes. After that, a drop of resin was gently deposited on 

each glass slide and each statolith was positioned inside the resin and left at room 

temperature to polymerize for at least 24 hours. Subsequently, all statoliths were 

photographed under a light optical microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a camera 

(Moticam2300) and their maximum diameter measured. 

 EPMA requires the exposure of the statolith center to the surface. So, the resin 

was sanded with Silicon carbide powder p1000 in water, always controlling the statolith 

maximum diameter under the microscope so it does not pass its center. Once achieved 

the center, the statolith surface was washed with distilled water and dried with 100% 

ethanol. Then, the surface was polished on a Planopol grinder polisher (Struers), holding 



55 

 

the glass slide with the hand and pressuring the surface being polished to the rotating 

cloth on the equipment at 75 rpm. Different diamond polishing pastes (DP-Pastes from 

Struers) were used, decreasing in grain (6µm, 1µm and ¼µm) in order to obtain a 

completely plain, light and bright surface for the EPMA. Each polishing paste was added 

to the respective Planopol cloth (one for each paste) and each statolith was polished 

during 3 to 4 minutes. A lubricant solution was also added to each cloth to avoid statoliths 

cracking and breaking. To remove pastes residues between different grains, glass slides 

were cleaned with 96% ethanol. At the end of the polishing process, glass slides were not 

only cleaned with 96% ethanol but also degreased by sonication in analytical grade 

ethanol for 15 minutes and then placed inside an oven at 40°C to dry for 5 minutes. 

 Perfectly polished, cleaned and bright statoliths were then metalized with carbon 

atoms (by vaporization) to guarantee the material electrical conductivity, and afterwards 

analysed by EMPA. In summary, this technique consists in projecting a finely focused 

electron beam (electron probe), of a diameter less than 1 µm, onto the point of the solid 

surface whose chemical composition is to be examined. Subsequently, the very small 

volume of material irradiated (&lt;1µm3) emits a complex X-ray spectrum which includes the 

characteristic radiations of the various elements present at that point. Spectrographic 

analysis of this X-ray spectrum allows the respective concentrations of these elements to 

be determined (Castaing 1960).  EMPA analysis was performed in a JEOL 8500-F electron 

probe microanalyser. This equipment is outfitted with 5 Wavelength Dispersive 

Spectrometers and has installed 12 analyzing crystals (PET, TAP, LIF and LDEs) that cover 

the whole spectrum from Beryllium (Z=4) to Uranium (Z=92). For rapid qualitative analysis 

it has also installed a high sensitivity SDD type Energy Dispersive Spectrometer. Chemical 

composition is determined by comparing the intensity of X-rays (number and 

energy/wavelength) from standards of known composition with those from unknown 

materials, correcting for the effects of atomic number, absorption and fluorescence in the 

sample using CITZAF correction program (Armstrong Program). The protocol for analysis 

was as follows. 

 Initially, the general composition of the sample was assessed by the Energy 

Dispersive X-ray Spectrum (EDS) acquired at 15kV, of a significant area of the statolith 



56 

 

exposed surface. This energy was chosen in order to have excited K? lines of heavier 

elements. To improve resolution, a Wavelength Dispersive X-ray Spectra (WDS) were also 

obtained under the same conditions. The spectra revealed the presence of major and 

minor elements that were then included in the analysis program. Before analysis, a 

backscattered electron image (COMP image) was acquired at 10kV and 10nA with the 

same conditions as the quantitative analysis. Whenever possible, 3 analyses (3 points) by 

increment were performed, including the statolith nucleus. The analytical conditions for 

the quantitative analysis involved an acceleration voltage of 10kV, a beam current of 

10nA and a beam diameter of 1µm. Line profiles for those elements along the statolith 

radius were also performed, searching for the occurrence of periodical cycles. These line 

profiles were carried out at an acceleration voltage of 15kV and a beam current of 20nA. 

 As Ba has been described as a trace element in statoliths of some gastropods 

larvae (Zacherl et al. 2003a; Zacherl et al. 2003b; Zacherl 2005; Lloyd et al. 2008), useful 

as a natural tag to track larval dispersal, its occurrence was also sought in one of the 

Nassarius reticulatus (L.) statoliths (S.3). In addition, some metallic elements – aluminium 

(Al), copper (Cu), mercury (Hg) and tin (Sn) – known to be environmental pollutants and 

so potentially capable of being deposited in statoliths, were also assessed in S.3. In these 

cases, longer measurement times (100s), an acceleration voltage of 10Kv and a higher 

beam current of 30nA were applied. 

 The standards used for quantitative analyses were: orthoclase (KAlSi3O8) for Al, 

barite (BaSO4) for Ba, calcite (CaCO3) for Ca, cuprite (Cu2O) for Cu, cinnabar (HgS) for Hg, 

periclase (MgO) for Mg, albite (NaAlSi3O8) for Na, pyrite (FeS2) for S, cassiterite (SnO2) for 

Sn and tausonite (SrTiO3) for Sr. As elements were determined as oxides, O 

concentrations were calculated by subtraction. 

 

3.4 Results and discussion 

 As mentioned in chapter 2, statoliths are typically spherical and exhibit a set of 

concentric layers deposited around a nucleus. In N. reticulatus this nucleus is produced 

during embryonic life and its formation is completed by the appearance of the 



57 

 

metamorphic ring at larval settlement (Barroso et al. 2005b; Chatzinikolaou and 

Richardson 2007). Thus, the term ‘ring’ refers to the dark segment of a bipartite structure 

called increment (Chatzinikolaou and Richardson 2007), which in fact corresponds to a 

light band together with the adjacent dark ring. These increments are repeatedly 

deposited around the nucleus, generating the statolith typical pattern, as can be observed 

in COMP images of Figures 36A to 36C for S.1 to S.3, respectively.  

 

 

Figure 36.  Nassarius reticulatus. COMP image showing general aspect of S.1 (A), S.2 (B), S.3 (C), indicating visible 

rings (MR, R1, R2, R3 and R4) and increments (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5), from the nucleus (N) to the statolith edge. MR: 

Metamorphic ring; R1: First ring; R2: Second ring; R3: Third ring; R4: Fourth ring; N: Nucleus; 1: First increment; 2: 

Second increment; 3: Third increment; 4: Fourth increment; 5: Fifth increment. 

 

All statoliths analysed show the same structural pattern: there is a nucleus 

delimited by a metamorphic ring (MR) and, in addition to this core, four other rings are 

observed (R1, R2, R3 and R4). Thus, the nucleus (N) is surrounded by 5 increments: 

increment “1” from the MR to R1; increment “2” from R1 to R2; increment “3” from R2 to 

R3; increment “4” from R3 to R4; increment “5” from R4 to the statolith edge (see Figure 

36). 

 Energy and wavelength dispersive X-ray spectra (EDS in Figure 37 and WDS in 

Figure 38) confirmed C, Ca and O as major elements in Nassarius reticulatus statoliths, 

corroborating the reported by other authors (Barroso et al. 2005b). Furthermore, the 

spectra also revealed the presence of some minor elements, namely: Mg, Na, S and Sr. 

 



58 

 

 

 

 

Worth mentioning that spectra did not indicate the presence of Cl, as mentioned 

for Aplysia californica statoconia (Wiederhold et al. 1989) and Helix lucorum statoconia

(Gorgiladze 2002); nor of K and Si as for H. lucorum statoconia (Gorgiladze 2002); neither 

P as it was described for statoliths of Strombus gigas larva (Salley 1986). 

 Maximum and minimum concentrations for Ca, Mg, Na, O, S and Sr by statolith are 

presented in Table 4. We were unable to quantify C under this protocol since our surfaces 

were metalized with atoms of this element to guarantee the material electrical 

conductivity. Generally, concentrations of Ca and O are of the same order of magnitude 

(1x105 ppm), as well as of the pair Na and Sr (1x103 ppm) and Mg and S (1x102 ppm).

 Data on the chemical composition of Helix lucorum statoconia are of the same 

order of magnitude as our results for Ca, O, Na and S (Gorgiladze 2002). However, we 

cannot compare absolute values since different analytical methods were applied and 

results are on different biogenic structures (statoconia and statolith) and in different 

species. In Nassarius reticulatus statoliths, Ca and O are effectively the most 

representative elements: Ca was found at higher concentrations, varying from 371500 to 

422300 ppm, while O ranged between 152700 and 171800 ppm (Table 3). Sodium 

concentrations varied from 2541 and 6063; Sr from 1307 and 8873 ppm; S from 469 and 

1309 ppm; and Mg, which was not always detected, ranged from 198 to 863 ppm. 

 Mean concentrations of these elements by increment (N, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) are 

shown in Tables 5, 6 and 7 for S.1, S.2 and S.3, respectively. It should be noted that the 



60 

 

narrowness of N in S.1 (Figure 36a and Table 5), of increment 5 in S.2 (Figure 36b and 

Table 6) and of increments 4 and 5 in S.3 (Figure 36c and Table 7) did not allow 

quantitative analyses at these areas. In EPMA, analyses are performed in points of ?1µm 

(the electron beam diameter) although an interaction volume of ?3µm must be 

considered. Hence, the interaction volume in the aforementioned cases would certainly 

imply the quantification of elements contained not only in the light band of the increment 

(as in all other cases) but also in the adjacent dark ring, thus misleading the results.

 Statistical comparisons on elemental composition of different increments were 

performed using software SigmaStat v3.5. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality and 

Levene’s test for homoscedasticity were significant in some cases and thus, a non-

parametric Kruskal-Wallis one way ANOVA on Ranks and the Dunn’s Post-Hoc test were 

used to compare concentrations of each element in different increments by statolith. 

Results are presented in table 8.

 In general, no significant differences in these elements concentrations were 

detected between increments. The only exception was Na concentration in statolith S.1, 

which presents a significant difference between increments 1 and 5, being higher in the 

last increment (compare Table 4 and Table 8).

Regarding the occurrence of periodical cycles, no particular pattern was evident. 

Figure 39 shows the line profiles for C, Ca, O and Sr in S.3 (the most representative 

elements in S.3), with the indication of the dark rings along the statolith radius, as an 

example of what was done to understand if any elemental pattern could be described. 

Likewise, Mg and S profiles (not shown in Figure 39 but also analysed) did not reveal any 

specific pattern along the statolith radius. 

 

 These are intriguing results since the annual periodicity of growth rings in the 

statoliths of Nassarius reticulatus was already proved (Chatzinikolaou and Richardson 

2007) and so it was expected that at least some of the major elements would show a 

periodical pattern along the statolith radius. However, there are no well marked peaks 

and instead several peaks are spread along the profiles: not even at rings, regions claimed 

to be produced annually when animals stop growing at the cold season (Barroso et al. 

2005a; Barroso et al. 2005b; Chatzinikolaou and Richardson 2007), any consistent 

decrease is observed. In the example of S.3 (Figure 39), Ca decreases slightly at the MR 

and increases at R1, having any particular variation in R2 and R3 and decreasing in R4. 

Oxygen decreases in R1 which coincides with the increase of Ca. Yet several other peaks 

are observed along the Ca profile, for example around 18 and 38µm from the profile 

start, where no ring is observed in the COMP image (within increments 1 and 2, see 

Figure 36).

S.3 dark rings position. On the bottom of the figure there is also part of Figure 35 (S.3 COMP image) indicating the 

exact position of S.3 dark rings (MR, R1, R2, R3 and R4). 

 

 The presence of other minor / trace elements – Al, Ba, Cu, Hg and Sn – was also 

sought in increments 1, 2 and 3 of statolith S.3. Tin was not detected in any of the nine 

punctual analyses conducted (three per increment). Aluminium and Hg were only 

detected at 22.2% of the points analysed (2 out of 9) while Cu was at 66.7% (6 out of 9) 



64 

 

and Ba at 88.9% (8 out of 9). Concentrations of Al, Ba, Cu and Hg by increment are 

presented in Table 9.

 We should have a critical view on these results since it seems that more 

appropriate techniques have been suggested for the accurate quantification of trace 

elements in this kind of biogenic structures. Campana (1997; 1999) showed that there are 

significant differences in determining otoliths elemental composition by using different 

analytical procedures. The author suggested that the major elements (C, Ca and O) can be 

truthfully determined by several methods but minor elements such as Na can only be 

accurately measured with an electron microprobe, while trace elements quantification 

require proton-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) or inductively coupled plasma mass 

spectrometry (ICP-MS). The author also pointed the reduced sensitivity of most beam-

based assays compared to their solution-based counterparts, in part due to the much 

lower sample weights being analysed. Not only did the sensitivity of the solution-based 

techniques extend over a broader range of elements, but the precision of those assays 

was significantly better than those of the beam-based methods (Campana 1997; 

Campana 1999). In fact, looking at our results, Mg was detected in the EDS spectrum as a 

minor element and we were not able to quantify it in some analyses (see Table 5 and 7) 



65 

 

whereas increasing measurement times and beam current allowed the detection and 

quantification of Ba and Cu in concentrations higher than those obtained for Mg in S.3 

(Table 7 and 9). 

 Of course that such a comparison of precision is not strictly valid, since the probed 

procedures incorporate the biogenic material heterogeneity which is not present in the 

solution-based methods. Actually, EPMA allows punctual analysis, without material loss 

and in specific areas, but what is an advantage in some cases can be of no value in others. 

EPMA allowed us to determine concentrations by increment, from the nucleus to the 

statolith edge, what is impossible by other analytical methods such as ICP-MS since the 

entire sample is consumed during analysis. Nonetheless, we cannot assume neither that 

the elements we quantified are the only ones present within our samples nor conclude 

that, because we could not detect for example Sn, this element is not present in 

statoliths. 

 Even so, these technique allow the characterization of Nassarius reticulatus adult 

statoliths and accurately measured the most representative elements – Ca, O, Sr, Na and 

S – along the structure all radius. 

 

3.5. The gastropod statolith organic matrix 

 

 There are also references for the presence of an organic matrix in gastropods 

statoliths, although it was not possible to find a definite work on such issue as there is for 

cephalopods statoliths (Radtke 1983) and fish otoliths (see review by Campana 1999).  

 D'Asaro (1965) noted that, after S. gigas veligers fixation in Bouin's acidic solution, 

all that was left of the statolith was a ‘layered organic matrix’. Some years later, Salley 

(1986) referred that the use of acetic acid have dissolved the mineral component of 

statoliths leaving behind a shrivelled organic (outer) matrix, but just in some of the S. 

gigas larvae analysed. The author has then pointed, as a possible explanation for 

inconsistency, that the organic matrix sheathing the statolith might form an impermeable 

coat, while in some statoliths a deformation of this outer layer could render their 



66 

 

permeability to the acid (Salley 1986). Apart from these records, though without checking 

chemical nor organic composition, Gorgiladze et al. (2010) stated that statoconia are 

microscopic biomineral structures formed by growth layers of mineral and organic origin. 

Nevertheless, these authors referred a previous work showing, by phase contrast 

microscopy, that statoconia consisted of alternating dark and light concentric layers 

around an optically dense oval core (or nucleus), often with radial streaks seen more or 

less clearly (Gorgiladze 2002). Actually, this internal microstructure of prominent and 

clearly defined concentric growth rings have been demonstrated in suitably prepared 

gastropod statoliths of Concholepas concholepas (Zacherl et al. 2003a), Littorina scabra 

(Bell 1984), Nassarius reticulatus (Barroso et al. 2005b; Chatzinikolaou and Richardson 

2007), Neptunea antiqua (Richardson et al. 2005a), Polinices pulchellus (Richardson et al. 

2005b), Strombus costatus (Grana-Raffucci and Appeldoorn 1997) and Strombus gigas 

(Salley 1986; Grana-Raffucci and Appeldoorn 1997). Hence, the gastropod statolith have 

been proposed for age and growth studies (Bell 1984; Grana-Raffucci and Appeldoorn 

1997; Barroso et al. 2005b; Richardson et al. 2005a; Richardson et al. 2005b; 

Chatzinikolaou and Richardson 2007), being also pointed as having particular potential for 

many others applications, namely understanding aspects of the life history and ecology of 

gastropods, issues previously provided only by fish and cephalopods.

Chapter 4 – Conclusion 

The statoltith, on gastropods, in the four subclasses studied on the present work 

(chapter 2), is only present on subclass Caenogastropoda. The fact that species of 

subclass Caenogastropoda have one statolith instead of statoconia makes them more 

interesting for the study of sclerochronology In all caenogastropods species the statolith 

can be characterized as round, translucent, with concentric rings.  

The statocyst are close to pedal ganglia, in caenogastropods are dorsal to pedal ganglia 

and in the others subclasses, Patellogastropoda, Vetigastropoda and Heterobranchia, are 

between pleural and pedal ganglia. The statocyst structure, of N. reticulatus 

(Caenogastropoda), is a transparent vesicle with a round shape like the found on 

heterobranchs. The main difference between the statocyst that have statoliths and the 

statocyst that have statoconia is the number and size of the receptor cells (Stahlschmidt 

and Wolff 1972; Mckee and Wiederhold 1974; Pedrozo et al. 1996; Gao and Wiederhold 

1997).  

It was verified that, in the specie Nucella lapillus, the statolith follows the growth 

of the animal from the embryo to adulthood. A statolith with 3 rings was observed in an 

embryo with 24th days. It was concluded that the statolith, in this specie, is formed before 

the 3rd week, probably in the beginning of the second week, as reported on Lloyd et al. 

(2008) for the specie Kelletia kelleti. The statolith growth is parallels to the species 

growth. This was already reported for N. recticulatus collected from Aveiro by Barroso et 

al. (2005b).  

The particularity, of the statolith increment follows the growth of the animal 

throughout life, lead us to want to know the statoltih composition, because the statolith 

may probably provide an important register of physical and chemical characteristics of 

the marine environment.  

The general composition of statoliths radius from adults N. reticulatus was 

characterized: Ca, O, Sr, Na and S. No significant differences in the different elements 

concentration between the increments were found. About the occurrence of periodical 

cycles in the statolith rings, there were no evidences of a particular pattern.  



70 

 

The rings in the statoltith are related with the age of the species. In spite of the 

results with the electron microprobe do not demonstrate the presence of seasonality in 

the rings, Barroso et al. (2005b) has proven that the statoltihs rings are annual rings. In 

fact, Barroso et al. (2005b) was the first work that demonstrated that adult gastropods 

statoliths of N. reticulatus had potential for sclerochronology.  

The study of adult gastropod statoliths is just beginning and there are many 

hypothesis to be tested, namely if statoliths can be accurately used as pluriannual 

chronometers; if they are good indicators of environmental pollution; and if, for example, 

these two properties can be combined to use gastropods statoliths as archives to 

reconstruct marine pollution histories. Some of these hypotheses have been successfully 

tested in analogous structures such as fish otoliths (Campana 1999) and cephalopods 

statoliths (Zumholz 2005) and also in some gastropods through monitoring annual rings 

production monthly in wild animals (Barroso et al. 2005a).  

 The hypothesis of using gastropods statoliths as biomarkers of marine pollution 

has huge interest for environmental pollution monitoring namely in coastal waters. In 

comparison with the open coast, near shore waters along coastal margins and estuaries 

are often rich in pollutants of anthropogenic origin (Bruland 1983) resulting in elevated 

concentrations of many elements in hard parts (as it has been shown for otoliths, 

considered as metabolically inert timekeepers and environmental recorders; Campana 

1999). Otoliths annular structure examination offers the possibility of evaluate 

contaminants incorporation over time, providing a historic record of past and recent 

exposure of fish to contaminants (Campana 1999). However, fishes are highly mobile and 

this approach has been applied mainly to track migratory and dispersion routes (Milton 

and Chenery 2001; Swearer et al. 2003). Contrariwise, as referred above, gastropods are 

sedentary or poorly mobile organisms, a pre-requisite for selecting them as good 

pollution indicators. Furthermore, the gastropod statolith is less complex than the 

cephalopods counterpart and their microstructure is already proved to allow age 

determination and to evaluate growth (Bell 1984; Grana-Raffucci and Appeldoorn 1997; 

Barroso et al. 2005b; Richardson et al. 2005a; Richardson et al. 2005b; Chatzinikolaou and 

Richardson 2007). Nevertheless, and despite the recognition of their great potential to

reconstruct marine pollution histories, there is still a long way to go until their validation 

as true biorecorders of environmental changes.
