ABSTRACT 

 

The process of spontaneous subduction initiation at passive margins plays a 

central role in the plate tectonics theory, in particular in the Wilson Cycle paradigmatic 

concept, which states that oceans form, evolve and finally close. The Wilson Cycle 

requires that after a certain time of oceanic drifting passive margins are reactivated and 

subduction initiates. However, the process of transformation of passive continental 

margins into active continental margins with subduction zones is still far from 

understood, and spontaneous transition examples between these two types of margins 

are not known. In addition, recent works based on theoretical calculations and physical 

modeling showed that it is mechanically unfeasible to form a new subduction system in 

isolation from an already existing one, i.e. spontaneous subduction initiation. One way 

to solve this problem is to consider that subduction initiation may generally be induced 

by the proximity of another subduction zone or by stress transference from a nearby 

collision belt, i.e. induced subduction initiation. Therefore, passive margins in the 

proximity of pre-existing subduction zones would represent preferential sites for the 

formation of new subduction zones. In this work, the Gibraltar Arc and the Southwest 

Iberia Margin are used as case studies to investigate the role that the orogenic arcs may 

have in the formation of new subduction systems at passive margins. 

The Atlantic margins are generally described as the typical case of passive 

margins, often termed Atlantic type margins. However, there are at least two regions 

where the Atlantic oceanic lithosphere is being consumed in subduction zones: in the 

Scotia and in the Lesser Antilles arcs (in the Southwestern and central West Atlantic, 

respectively). These subduction zones seem to have been transferred from the Eastern 

Pacific ocean to the Atlantic domain and potentially represent precursors to a system of 

convergent zones that might ultimately result in the closure of the Atlantic Ocean. 

However, in these two systems the oceanic lithosphere has been subducted since at least 

the Early Cenozoic, without lateral propagation of the subduction zones along the 

adjacent Atlantic passive margins. The Gulf of Cadiz, i.e. the foreland of the Gibraltar 

orogenic arc, has been proposed as a potential locus for a subduction zone to propagate 

into the open Atlantic. On the other hand, the proximity of the Gibraltar collision belt to 

the Southwest Iberia Margin, together with the existing overall convergence between 



II 

 

Africa and Iberia, induces compressive stresses that, in association with the existence of 

more than 100 km long active thrusts (e.g. Horseshoe Fault and Gorringe Bank), make 

this margin a strong candidate for the nucleation of a new subduction zone.  

In order to better evaluate the post-Miocene tectonics and the main tectonic 

driving mechanism operating in the Gulf of Cadiz an up-to-date tectonic map of this 

area was produced. This map was based on the coupled analysis of a multi-survey MCS 

dataset and the recently compiled high resolution bathymetry dataset (the SWIM 

bathymetry). The mapping revealed the existence of three main systems of tectonic 

structures: i) the subduction-related Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge (CGAW); ii) a 

set of WNW-ESE striking dextral strike-slip faults (the SWIM fault system); and iii) a 

group of NE-SW striking northwest-directed thrusts located in the Southwest Iberia 

Margin (the NE-SW thrust system).  

The subduction-related accretionary wedge (GCAW) is materialized on the 

seafloor by a west dipping U-shaped surface and consists in an eastward thickening pile 

of westwards thrusted sediments. There are evidences that this thrust wedge is active 

and propagating westward.  

The SWIM fault system is a group of WNW-ESE striking subvertical strike-slip 

faults extending from the eastern part of the Gulf of Cadiz, i.e. the northwest Moroccan 

shelf, to the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain. These faults were interpreted in this work as the 

Present day dextral reactivation of the old Mesozoic Tethyan plate boundary.  

The NE-SW striking thrust system is a group northwest directed thrusts located 

along the Southwest Iberia Margin, comprising the Horseshoe fault, the Marquês de 

Pombal fault, the Tagus Abyssal Plain fault and the Gorringe northern thrust. This NE-

SW thrust system seems to be the result of the migration of the deformation, in the 

Pliocene-Quaternary, from the realm of the Gibraltar wedge to the west (onto the 

Horseshoe fault region) and to the north along the West Portuguese Margin. These 

structures may be the expression of a new compressive deformation front.  

Besides these three tectonic systems, other important structures were also 

promptly recognized such as the ENE-WSW to E-W striking system of thrusts (e.g. the 

Portimão pop-up and the Coral Patch Ridge), related with the overall Cenozoic Nubia-



III 

 

Iberia N-S convergence, and NE-SW striking Cadiz fault, a dextral strike-slip fault that 

probably accommodates part the westward movement of the Gibraltar Arc. 

The analysis of the multibeam bathymetry data from the northwestern part of the 

Gulf of Cadiz also revealed the existence of several intriguing kilometric crescentic 

depressions lying at depths between -4300 m and -4700 m, never before reported to 

occur at such great depths in the scientific literature. These features are located in the 

Horseshoe Valley between two major tectonic structures: the GCAW and the Horseshoe 

fault. Morphological parameterization of these features, coupled with detailed analysis 

of multi-channel and middle resolution seismic profiles, showed that these crescent-

shaped features were formed due to the existence of specific interaction between: a) 

regional active thrusts on top of which most crescentic depressions are carved; and b) 

tectonically induced scouring comprising localized erosion and simultaneous 

progradational sedimentation, produced by downslope turbiditic currents. The obtained 

results also suggest a possible contribution of fluid migration and extrusion processes, 

such as mud volcanism and associated pockmark formation, besides gravity driven 

landslides and slumping, in the development of the studied crescentic depressions. The 

active (mainly blind) thrusts in which the crescentic depressions are carved root in the 

GCAW décollement layer, to the west of the GCAW deformation front. Therefore, the 

crescentic depressions are interpreted as the morphological expression of the westward 

propagation of the deformation related with the GCAW, into the Horseshoe Valley 

domain. 

Besides the new produced cartography of the Gulf of Cadiz, the present work 

also benefited from the instrumental use of analog modeling experiments. Three main 

different modes of tectonic interference between the SWIM strike-slip fault system 

(related with the overall Nubia-Iberia convergence) and the GCAW (related with the 

Gibraltar subduction) were tested through analog sand-box modeling, namely: a) An 

active accretionary wedge on top of a pre-existent inactive basement fault; b) An active 

strike-slip fault cutting a previously formed, inactive, accretionary wedge; and c) 

Simultaneous activity of both the accretionary wedge and the strike-slip fault. The 

results obtained and the comparison with the natural deformation pattern favor a 

tectonic evolution comprising two main steps: i) the development of the Gulf of Cadiz 

Accretionary Wedge on top of inactive, Tethyan-related, basement faults (Middle 

Miocene to ~1.8 Ma); ii) subsequent reactivation of these basement faults with dextral 



IV 

 

strike-slip motion (~1.8 Ma to Present) simultaneously with continued tectonic 

accretion in the GCAW. These results exclude the possibility of ongoing active SWIM 

wrench system cross-cutting an inactive GCAW structure. The results also support a 

new interpretation of the SWIM wrench system as fundamentally resulting from strike-

slip reactivation of an old (Tethyan-related) plate boundary.  

Detail mapping in the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain also revealed the existence of a 

new morphotectonic pattern near the intersection (corner zone) of the SWIM 1 fault and 

the Horseshoe fault. Based on combined analog and numerical experiments this pattern 

was interpreted as resulting from the (wrench-thrust) tectonic interference between two 

of the main tectonic systems recognized in the Gulf of Cadiz area: the SWIM faults and 

the NE-SW thrusts.  

Finally, the results presented in this work favor a hypothetic scenario in which 

the Gibraltar subduction is active, but decreasing in activity since the Miocene, at the 

same time that an incipient subduction zone may be nucleating in the Southwest Iberia 

Margin. The Gulf of Cadiz may be thus seen as a place where the proximity of a pre-

existent subduction system could be inducing the formation of a new subduction zone in 

the Atlantic.

RESUMO 

 

 O processo de iniciação espontânea de novas zonas de subducção ao longo de 

margens passivas tem um papel central na teoria da tectónica de placas, em particular no 

conceito paradigmático de Ciclo de Wilson, que afirma que os oceanos formam-se, 

evoluem e finalmente acabam por fechar. O Ciclo de Wilson requer que após um 

determinado tempo de evolução de um oceano as suas margens passivas sejam 

reactivadas e que uma nova zona de subducção se inicie. No entanto, o processo de 

transformação de margens continentais passivas em margens continentais activas com 

zonas de subducção é praticamente desconhecido, sendo que não se encontra 

documentado nenhum caso de transição espontânea entre estes dois tipos de margens. 

Acresce ainda que, trabalhos recentes de modelação numérica e cálculos teóricos 

mostraram que é fisicamente implausível a formação de novos sistemas de zonas de 

subducção isolados de zonas de subducção pré-existentes, isto é subducção espontânea. 

Uma forma de ultrapassar esta inconsistência é considerar que a iniciação de novas 

zonas de subducção é em geral induzida pela proximidade de outras zonas de subducção 

ou por compressão induzida a partir de um orógeno próximo, isto é, subducção 

induzida. Deste modo, as margens passivas próximas de zonas de subducção pré-

existentes podem ser vistas como os locais preferenciais para a formação de novas 

zonas de subducção. No presente trabalho, usa-se o Arco de Gibraltar e a Margem 

Sudoeste Ibérica como casos de estudo na tentativa de abordar a temática do papel que 

os arcos orogénicos podem ter na formação de novas zonas de subducção ao longo de 

margens passivas. 

As margens Atlânticas são geralmente descritas como o caso típico de margens 

passivas, pelo que estas são comummente denominadas de margens do tipo Atlântico. 

No entanto, há pelo menos dois locais na Terra onde litosfera oceânica Atlântica é 

consumida em zonas de subducção: no arco Scotia e no arco das Pequenas Antilhas (no 

Sudoeste Atlântico e no Atlântico Oeste central, respectivamente). Estes dois casos de 

zonas de subducção parecem ter sido transferidas do Oceano Pacífico oriental para o 

domínio Atlântico e podem ser vistos como os precursores do desenvolvimento de um 

novo limite de placas convergente que poderá em última instancia levar ao fecho do 

Oceano Atlântico. Porém, a litosfera oceânica tem vindo a ser subductada nestes dois 



VI 

 

sistemas desde pelo menos o Cenozóico inferior, sem ter ocorrido a propagação da 

subducção ao longo das margens passivas atlânticas adjacentes. O Golfo de Cádis, isto 

é, a bacia de ante-país do arco orogénico de Gibraltar, tem sido descrito como o terceiro 

local na Terra onde existe o potencial para uma zona de subducção pré-existente 

propagar-se para domínio Atlântico. Por outro lado, a proximidade do Arco de Gibraltar 

em relação à Margem Sudoeste Ibérica, em conjunto com a existência de convergência 

generalizada entre as placas tectónicas África e Ibéria, induz tensões compressivas nesta 

margem o que, em associação com a existência de cavalgamentos activos de largura 

superior a 100 km (por exemplo a Falha da Ferradura e o Banco Gorringe), a tornam 

numa forte candidata ao processo de nucleação de uma nova zona de subducção. 

Com o objectivo de melhorar a compreensão da tectónica pós-miocénica e dos 

principais mecanismos tectónicos forçadores a actuar no Golfo de Cádis foi elaborado 

um mapa tectónico actualizado à escala do golfo. Este mapa foi preparado com base na 

análise conjunta de dados de diversas campanhas de sísmica de reflexão multi-canal e 

de dados de batimetria multi-feixe de alta resolução recentemente compilados 

(batimetria SWIM). A cartografia mostrou a existência de três sistemas de estruturas 

tectónicas principais: i) o Prisma Acrecionário do Golfo de Cádis (PAGC); ii) um grupo 

de falhas de desligamento direito com a direcção WNW-ESE (sistema de falhas SWIM) 

e; iii) um grupo de cavalgamentos com a direcção NE-SW, vergentes para noroeste, 

localizados ao longo da Margem Sudoeste Ibérica (sistema de cavalgamentos NE-SW).  

O prisma acrecionário (PAGC) destaca-se no fundo do mar pela presença de um 

relevo morfológico positivo em forma de U que consiste na expressão superficial do 

empilhamento de sedimentos cavalgados para oeste. Este prisma gerou-se como 

resultado da existência da referida zona de subducção mergulhante para Este sob o Arco 

de Gibraltar. Existem evidências de que este prisma acrecionário ainda está activo e a 

propagar-se para oeste. 

O sistema de falhas SWIM constitui um grupo de falhas de desligamento direito, 

sub-verticais, que se estendem desde a área mais oriental do Golfo de Cádis, na 

plataforma continental do noroeste de Marrocos, até à Planície Abissal da Ferradura. 

Estas falhas foram interpretadas neste trabalho como tendo resultado da reactivação 

direita da fronteira de placas Mesozóica do Tétis. 



VII 

 

O sistema de cavalgamentos NE-SW é constituído por um grupo de 

cavalgamentos com direcção NE-SW, vergentes para noroeste localizados ao longo da 

Margem Sudoeste Ibérica que compreende a falha da Ferradura, a falha do Marquês de 

Pombal, a falha da Planície Abissal do Tejo e o cavalgamento norte do Gorringe. A 

deformação pliocénica-quaternária deste sistema é interpretada como a expressão da 

migração da deformação da frente de deformação do PAGC para oeste (até à zona da 

falha da Ferradura) e para norte ao longo da Margem Oeste Portuguesa. Estas estruturas 

parecem corresponder a uma nova frente de deformação compressiva, afastada do Arco 

de Gibraltar, que eventualmente poderá resultar na nucleação de uma nova zona de 

subducção na margem Sudoeste da Ibéria.  

Para além destes três sistemas tectónicos, foram reconhecidas outras estruturas 

importantes como é o caso dos cavalgamentos com direcção ENE-WSW a E-W (e.g. 

Banco de Portimão e Crista Coral Patch), relacionados com a convergência N-S 

generalizada entre as placas Núbia e Ibéria no Cenozóico, e a falha de Cádis que 

corresponde a um desligamento direito de direcção NE-SW e que acomoda parte do 

movimento para oeste do Arco de Gibraltar e da deformação limítrofe da margem sul 

portuguesa. 

 Os dados de batimetria multi-feixe da área noroeste do Golfo de Cádis revelaram 

ainda a existência de um conjunto de intrigantes depressões em forma de crescente com 

dimensões quilométricas, localizadas entre os -4300 m e os -4700 m de profundidade. 

Objectos morfológicos com estas características nunca haviam sido identificados a tão 

grandes profundidades. Estas depressões estão localizadas no Vale da Ferradura entre 

duas estruturas tectónicas importantes: o PAGC e a falha da Ferradura. A análise 

morfológica destas formas, em conjunto com a análise detalhada de perfis de reflexão 

sísmica multi-canal e de média resolução, revelou que estas estruturas em crescente se 

formaram como resultado da interacção entre: a) actividade de falhas de cavalgamento 

que geram degraus tectónicos no topo dos quais os crescentes estão encaixados e b) 

erosão e re-deposição simultânea de sedimentos produzidos pela acção de correntes de 

fundo, provavelmente de origem turbidítica, que interagem com estes degraus 

tectónicos. Os resultados obtidos sugerem também uma contribuição de processos de 

migração e extrusão de fluidos, como vulcanismo de lama e formação de pockmarks, 

para além de movimentos de massa, no desenvolvimento das depressões em forma de 

crescente estudadas. Os cavalgamentos (essencialmente cegos) no topo dos quais os 



VIII 

 

crescentes estão encaixados enraízam ao nível do descolamento basal do PAGC, a oeste 

da sua frente de deformação morfológica. Deste modo, estas depressões em forma de 

crescente são também interpretadas como a expressão da migração da deformação 

relacionada com o PAGC para oeste, em direcção à área do Vale da Ferradura. 

 Para além da nova cartografia tectónica do Golfo de Cádis, sustentada na 

interpretação de dados de sísmica multi-canal e batimetria multifeixe, este trabalho 

beneficiou ainda do uso instrumental de modelação análoga. Três modos de 

interferência tectónica entre o sistema de desligamentos SWIM (relacionado com a 

convergência generalizada entre a Núbia e a Ibéria) e o PAGC (relacionado com a zona 

de subducção do Arco de Gibraltar) foram testados através de modelação análoga, 

usando ”caixas de areia”, compreendendo: a) a formação de um prisma acrecionário 

sobre uma falha basal inactiva pré-existente; b) a actividade de uma falha de 

desligamento afectando um prisma acrecionário inactivo previamente formado; e c) a 

actividade simultânea de um prisma acrecionário e de uma falha de desligamento. Os 

resultados obtidos e a comparação com o padrão de deformação natural observado 

favorecem um cenário de evolução tectónica que compreende duas etapas principais: i) 

o desenvolvimento do PAGC sobre falhas basais inactivas, relacionadas com a abertura 

do Tétis (entre o Miocénico Médio e os 1,8 Ma); ii) subsequente reactivação destas 

falhas com movimento de desligamento direito (~1,8 Ma até ao presente) ao mesmo 

tempo que o PAGC se continuava a desenvolver. Os resultados excluem a possibilidade 

de existência de um sistema de desligamentos (SWIM) a cortar um prisma acrecionário 

inactivo (PAGC). Estes resultados suportam ainda uma nova interpretação do sistema 

SWIM, na qual estes desligamentos resultam fundamentalmente da reactivação direita 

da antiga fronteira de placas do extremo ocidental do oceano Tétis Alpino.  

 A cartografia detalhada realizada na região da Planície Abissal da Ferradura 

permitiu também reconhecer um novo padrão morfo-tectónico existente na zona de 

intersecção (zona de canto) da falha SWIM 1 com a falha da Ferradura. Com base no 

uso conjunto de modelação análoga e numérica este padrão foi interpretado como tendo 

resultado da interferência tectónica (desligamento-cavalgamento) entre dois dos 

principais sistemas tectónicos activos no Golfo de Cádis: as falhas SWIM e os 

cavalgamentos NE-SW. 



IX 

 

 Por último, os resultados apresentados neste trabalho favorecem um cenário 

tectónico hipotético no qual a actividade da zona de subducção presente sob o Arco de 

Gibraltar tem vindo a decrescer desde o Miocénico, ao mesmo tempo que uma zona de 

subducção incipiente poderá estar a desenvolver-se na Margem Sudoeste Ibérica. O 

Golfo de Cádis pode assim ser visto como um local onde a proximidade de uma zona de 

subducção pré-existente poderá estar a induzir a formação de uma nova zona de 

subducção no Atlântico.

Chapter 1 
Introduction 

 

1.1. Motivation 

 

Earth is a singular planet and plate tectonics is one of its most distinctive 

features. Missions to other planets and moons revealed that the Earth is the only body in 

the solar system with subduction zones and an active plate tectonic regime (Stern et al., 

2004; Stevenson, 2003). One of the most paradigmatic concepts in the plate tectonics 

theory is the Wilson Cycle which states that oceans form, evolve and close (Wilson, 

1966). This dynamic process is based on the fact that the Earth‘s lithosphere is 

composed of several plates separated by three types of boundaries: divergent, transform 

and convergent (Isacks et al., 1968; Vine and Hess, 1970). Subduction zones are the 

convergent boundaries where oceanic lithosphere is recycled in the mantle, allowing the 

differentiation of continents and heat transfer from the Earth‘s interior (Stern, 2002). 

The Wilson Cycle requires that after a certain time of an ocean evolution, passive 

margins are reactivated and subduction initiates. However, the process by which a 

passive margin converts into an active margin is still controversial and fundamentally 

unknown (e.g. Mueller and Philips, 1991; Stern, 2002 and 2004; Gurnis et al., 2004; 

Nikolaeva, et al., 2010). Despite the abundance of both passive and active continental 

margins on Earth, no obvious cases of transition between these two types of margins 

have been identified so far (Nikolaeva, et al., 2010). One way to overcome this apparent 

paradox is to consider that subduction initiation may generally be induced by the 

proximity of another subduction zone or by stress transference from a near collision 

belt. Therefore, passive margins in the proximity of a mature subduction complex would 

represent preferential sites for trench formation (Mueller and Philips, 1991). 

The Atlantic margins are generally described as the typical case of passive 

margins (Gibbs, 1984). However, there are at least two regions where Atlantic oceanic 

lithosphere is being consumed in subduction zones: in the Scotia and in the Lesser

Antilles arcs (Deuser, 1970; Schellart and Lister, 2004; Fig. 1.1). These subduction 

zones seem to have been transferred from the Eastern Pacific ocean to the Atlantic 

domain (Mueller and Phillips, 1991; Royden, 1993; Goren et al., 2008). These arcs 

potentially represent precursors to a system of convergent zones that might ultimately 

result in the destruction of the Atlantic Ocean (Mueller and Phillips, 1991). The Gulf of 

Cadiz, i.e. the foreland of the Gibraltar Arc (Figs. 1.1 and 1.2), is the third place that 

was described as a potential locus for subduction to propagate to open Atlantic (Royden, 

1993). On the other hand, the proximity of the Gibraltar collision belt to the Southwest 

Iberia Margin (see Fig. 1.2), together with the existing overall convergence between 

Africa and Iberia, induces compressive stresses that make this margin a strong candidate 

for the nucleation of a new subduction zone.

1.2. The Gulf of Cadiz 

 

The Gulf of Cadiz is situated in the North Atlantic Ocean, west of the Gibraltar 

Straits, offshore SW Iberia and NW Morocco (Fig. 1.2). It corresponds to the transition 

zone between the Mediterranean Alpine Collision Belt and the Atlantic Azores – 

Gibraltar Fracture Zone (AGFZ), encompassing a puzzling segment of the Africa-

Eurasia plate boundary. Although in this region the nature of the boundary is not yet 

entirely understood and it is subject of a debate, geological and geophysical data point 

to the existence of a non-discrete lithospheric limit. In accordance, some authors 

described this region as a diffuse plate boundary (e.g. Sartori et al., 1994; Morel and 

Meghraoui, 1996; Medialdea et al., 2004; Terrinha et al., 2009; Zitellini et al., 2009), in 

which several differently oriented tectonic structures, mainly Northwestwards directed 

thrusts and W-E to WNW-ESE wrench faults, are responsible for the dissipation of the 

compressive stress associated to a WNW-ESE Present day convergence between 

Eurasia (Iberia sub-plate) and Africa (Nubia sub-plate) at a rate of ca. 4 mm/yr (Argus 

et al., 1989; DeMets et al., 1994; Sella et al., 2002; Calais et al., 2003; Fernandes et al., 

2003; Fernandes, 2004; Nocquet and Calais, 2004; Fernandes et al., 2007). 

The Gulf of Cadiz area has been proposed as the locus of the 1755 Great Lisbon 

Earthquake (estimated magnitude of 8.5 to 8.9; Abe et al, 1979; Johnston, 1996; Batista 

et al., 1998; Martinez-Solares and Arroyo, 2004) that originated a devastating tsunami 

and destroyed the Portuguese capital (Baptista et al., 1998; Zitellini et al., 2001; 

Martinez-Solares and Arroyo, 2004). The precise location of its source is subject of 

ongoing debate (e.g. Baptista et al., 1998; Buforn et al., 1998; Zitellini et al., 2001; 

Gutscher et al., 2002; Gutscher, 2004;  Gracia et al., 2003b; Terrinha et al., 2003; 

Gutscher, 2004; Terrinha et al., 2009). Major efforts were made to map the main 

tectonic structures that historical and instrumental seismic events have shown to be 

potentially capable of generating moderate to high magnitude earthquakes (e.g.  Ms=7.9 

and Mw=6.0, 28/02/1969 and 12/02/2007 earthquakes respectively; Fukao, 1973 and 

Stich et al., 2006, 2007). New findings emerged from the interpretation of a great 

variety of recently acquired data (e.g. multibeam swath bathymetry, reflection and 

refraction seismics, geodetic), which allowed a better understanding of the Gulf of 

Cadiz tectonic evolution (e.g. Johnston, 1996, Gonzalez et al., 1996; Zitellini et al.,

Zitellini et al., 2009).

Fernandes et al., 2007). Inset in the upper right showing the location of the Gulf of Cadiz area in the 

general tectonic setting of the western Nubia - Eurasia plate boundary. 

 

 Gutscher et al. (2002), building on previously ideas put forward by other authors 

(e.g. Royden, 1993; Lonergan and White, 1997), considered the tectonic evolution of 

this area as being dominated by active retreating subduction along an E-W oceanic 

corridor, caused by the roll-back of an east-dipping lithospheric slab, presently 

positioned underneath the Gibraltar Arc (Figs. 1.3 and 1.4A). This hypothesis is 

compatible with the geodetic data that show a portion of the Gibraltar Arc moving 



5 

 

southwestwards relatively to a stable Iberia at a rate of ca. 3.5 mm/yr, and obliquely to 

Africa (Fig 1.4B; Stich et al., 2006; Fernandes et al., 2007; Tahayt et al., 2008). On the 

other hand, the West Iberia Margin also shows evidences of tectonic reactivation (see 

Fig. 1.4A and C), possibly as the consequence of the westward movement of the 

Gibraltar Arc and of the present WNW-ESE trajectory of Nubia in relation to Iberia 

(Terrinha et al., 2009). In this context, two end members of working hypothesis/models 

can be envisaged: (1) The Gulf of Cadiz subduction zone is active and retreating 

towards open Atlantic (Gutscher et al., 2002), comparable to what happened in the 

Scotia and Lesser Antilles arcs; (2) The subduction is blocked/inactive and the 

Southwest Portuguese Margin is being reactivated and possibly constitutes an example 

of an incipient subduction (Ribeiro et al., 1996). Recently, another significant tectonic 

feature was indentified in the Gulf of Cadiz: the SWIM faults system (Duarte et al., 

2009; Terrinha et al., 2009; Zitellini et al., 2009). These faults were proposed to be the 

expression a newly formed plate boundary, corresponding to a broad transpressive 

deformation band, connecting the Gibraltar Arc to the compressive structures in the 

Southwest Iberia Margin (Zitellini et al., 2009; see Figs. 1.2 and 1.4C).

1.3. Aim of the work 

 

The initial motivation of this work was to investigate the role that orogenic arcs 

may have in the reactivation of passive margins, using the Gulf of Cadiz (foreland of the 

Gibraltar arc) and the Southwest Iberia (passive) Margin as a case study. In this context, 

this Ph.D. thesis specifically aims at: a) unraveling the main tectonic structures in the 

Gulf of Cadiz, producing a new up-dated tectonic map of the region, based on the 

interpretation of recently acquired bathymetric and seismic data; b) unravel the present 

day tectonics of this key segment of the Iberia-Nubia plate boundary, based on the 

interpretation of the mapped structures, seeking to know what are dominant tectonic 

driven mechanisms: the overall convergence between Africa and Eurasia, the westward 

movement of the Gibraltar Arc, or both; and c) test previous models, and newly 

proposed assumptions, through analogue (physical) modeling experiments.  

The body of the manuscript is structured in eight Chapters. The first three 

Chapters correspond to the introduction of the problematic at stake and the used 

methods; the fourth chapter corresponds to the up-dated tectonic map of the Gulf of 

Cadiz region; and the following three chapters are structured as research papers 

(including Duarte et al., 2010; Duarte et al., submitted; and Duarte, in prep.). A final 

chapter of conclusions is also included in the body of the manuscript. Three research 

papers in which the author of the thesis is co-author and were also part of the work 

involved in this PhD project are incorporated as appendixes (Terrinha et al., 2009; 

Rosas et al., 2009; Rosas et al., submitted), together with another paper published by the 

author (Duarte et al., 2009)

Chapter 2 
Main acknowledged concepts 

 

2.1. Subduction zones 

 

Planet Earth has a cool strong external layer named lithosphere. This layer is 

fragmented in several tectonic plates moving in relation to each other with convergent, 

divergent or transform kinematics above the less viscous and weaker asthenosphere. 

Subduction is the process that takes place at convergent boundaries by which one 

tectonic plate, typically more dense, sinks under another into the mantle (Fig. 2.1). The 

oceanic lithosphere becomes denser than the underlying asthenosphere within 20-50 Ma 

after it forms (Oxburgh &amp;amp; Parmentier, 1977; Davis, 1992). At this stage the lithosphere 

becomes unstable and subduction initiation is the Earth‘s way to maintain its 

thermodynamic equilibrium (Stern, 2004). In this context, subduction zones are the 

three-dimensional manifestation of the Earth convective downwelling, and arc-trench 

complexes are the crustal manifestations of a subduction zone operating beneath it 

(Stern, 2002). Subduction zones are defined by the inclined array of earthquakes known 

as the Wadati-Benioff Zone (red stars in Fig. 2.1).  

One paradigmatic idea of the early Plate Tectonic Theory was that mantle 

thermal convection moves the lithosphere, dragging the plates as it moves (Holmes, 

1929; Mckenzie, 1969). This idea is deeply rooted in the scientific and pedagogic 

community and it is generally spread among tectonics introductory books (Stern, 2004). 

However, it is now widely accepted that Earth‘s mantle convects mostly because cold 

lithosphere sinks at subduction zones (Elsasser, 1967; Hager &amp;amp; O‘Connell, 1981; Davis 

&amp;amp; Richards, 1992; Hamilton, 2003; Stern, 2004). The base of the continents may be 

locally dragged by the circulating mantle but is the slab pull (and slab suction), resulting 

from the negative buoyancy of the cooler and denser lithosphere at subduction zones, 

that drives the tectonic plates (see Fig. 2.1; Elsasser, 1971; Forsyth and Uyeda, 1975; 



10 

 

Bott and Kusznier, 1984; Davis, 1992; Anderson, 2002; Conrad &amp;amp; Lithgow-Bertelloni, 

2002; Hamilton, 2003). Elder (1976), based on laboratory models, also concluded that 

there is no direct link between asthenospheric flow and plate motion, and thus plates 

cannot be driven by ?mantle drag? (Park, 1988). According with Lithgow-Bertelloni 

and Richards (1995) 90% of the force needed to move the plates is caused by the 

sinking of lithospheric slabs in subduction zones (slab pull), as the other 10% is 

originated in the rift zones, consequence of oceanic spreading (ridge push; Stern, 2004).

2.1.1. When did subduction begin? 

 

One of the major challenges in modern geology is to understand how and where 

subduction initiates. To address this problem it is important to try to recognize when the 

Present plate tectonic regime was established on Earth and when did subduction become 

a dominant process. Given the present state of knowledge on planetary evolution, it is 

not reasonable to assume that the Earth had the same tectonic regime for the last 4.4 Ga. 

It is known that Earth was hotter in the past and consequently both crustal and mantle 

processes, including subduction, changed throughout the planet cooling process 

(Hamilton, 2003). For instance, if subduction is strongly dependent on the density 

increase of the oceanic crust, and this increase is the result of its cooling, it is possible to 



11 

 

assume that in the past, due to the higher planet‘s temperature, the crust probably did 

cool slowly and thus would take more time to become unstable and start to subduct. 

Also, the high heat flux probably caused high crustal melting and thickening. Given that 

the crust is much less denser than the asthenosphere, a thicker crust would inhibit 

lithosphere to sink (Stern, 2004). With this reasoning becomes clear that plate tectonics 

requires a planet to be in delicate thermal equilibrium (Sleep, 2000). Plate tectonics can 

always be shut down either by rift lock, if the mantle is too cold to allow adiabatic 

melting, or by trench lock, if the mantle is to hot that oceanic crust becomes too thick to 

subduct (Stern, 2004). 

Recent studies indicate that the Earth did not have a conventional tectonic plate 

regime for a major part of its history. It is generally accepted that before 1.0 to 2.0 Ga 

the Earth‘s surface was not cold enough to sustain plate tectonic and subduction zones 

(Kontinen, 1987; Scott et al., 1992; Davis, 1992; Davis and Richards, 1992; Kuski, 

2001; Hamilton, 2003; Stern, 2004). According to Hamilton (2003) the crust and upper 

mantle have formed a mostly closed system throughout geologic time, and their 

temporal changes are responses to cooling. The changing processes define a Punctuated 

Gradualism rather than the classical Uniformitarianism (Hamilton, 2003). Major stages 

in Earth evolution are (Hamilton, 2003):  

(1) 4.567–ca. 4.4 Ga. Hot accretion and major irreversible mantle fractionation;  

(2) 4.4–3.5 Ga. Era of nearly global felsic crust, too hot and mobile to stand as 

continents;  

(3) 3.5–2.0 Ga. Granite-and-greenstone era. Permanent hydrosphere. Old crust 

cooled to density permitting mafic melts to reach surface. Diapiric batholiths mobilized 

from underlying old crust; 

(4) 2.0 Ga–continuing. Plate tectonic era. Distinct continents and oceans. Top-

down cooling of oceanic lithosphere enables subduction that drives plates and forces 

spreading. 

Also new planetary geological data, resulting from the studies of silicate planets 

and moons in the Solar System, allowed the recognition of three general states of 

planetary evolution based on different mantle convection modes: 1) magma ocean, 2) 

plate tectonics and 3) stagnant lid (Sleep, 2000). Mercury, Venus and Mars, despite the 



12 

 

existence of some mantle convection, are presently recognized to be in the stagnant lid 

state. Actually, Venus may be in the transition stage from plate tectonic to stagnant lid 

(Stevenson, 2003). The understanding of the geodynamical past and present of the other 

planets and moons is one of the most promising investigation lines in the planetary 

geology discipline, which may help to comprehend Earth‘s evolution and its past 

geodynamical regimes. Specifically, it is crucial to understand if the Earth‘s plate 

tectonic regime with subduction zones is exclusive from our planet or if it might exist or 

have existed in other rocky bodies.  

 

 

2.1.2. Subduction initiation at passive margins 

 

Despite the widespread occurrence of subduction zones in our planet, the 

process by which a passive margin converts into an active margin is still highly 

controversial and fundamentally unknown (Stern, 2002; 2004; Gurnis et al., 2004; 

Nikolaeva et al., 2010). It is traditionally assumed that spontaneous subduction 

initiation at passive margins occurs when the gravitational unstable oceanic lithosphere 

collapses into the asthenosphere, consequence of density excess resulting from 

lithosphere aging. This process is a corollary of the Wilson Cycle and has been for long 

the most widely accepted model for trench formation (e.g. Vlaar and Wortel, 1976; 

Davies, 1999). However, several works showed that the strength of the oceanic 

lithosphere also increases with age and thus its aging by itself does not make it more 

susceptible to spontaneously collapse in the asthenosphere (Fig. 2.2; McKenzie, 1977; 

Cloetingh et al., 1984; Mueller and Phillips, 1991). This conclusion is supported by the 

existence of 170 Ma old oceanic crust adjacent to the NW Africa and NE America 

passive margins. In addition, according to Mueller and Phillips (1991), the geological 

record does not reveal a single example of an Atlantic-type margin evolving into an 

Andean-type without the intervening of an arc-continent collision. One way to explain 

subduction initiation is to consider that it may be induced by the proximity of another 

subduction zone or by stress transference from a near collision belt. Therefore, fractured 

passive margins and transform faults in the proximity of a mature subduction complex 

would represent preferential sites for trench formation (Mueller and Phillips, 1991). 



13 

 

 

 

Figure 2.2 – Minimum force (per unit of distance) required to promote incipient lithospheric convergence 

within normal oceanic lithosphere as function of fault plane angle. Lithosphere of all ages (t) is capable of 

withstanding compressional stresses associated with ridge push (that are of the order of 10
12

 N/m). This is 

why seafloor does not spontaneously founder upon achieving negative buoyancy (Extracted from Mueller 

and Phillips, 1991). Note that slab pull forces may exceed 10
14

 N/m and typically are about 5 x 10
13

 N/m 

(Mueller and Phillips, 1991). 

 

Stern (2004), in its seminal paper, argues that in principle subduction zones can 

form by two distinct ways: induced or spontaneous. In its simpler form induced 

subduction results from the continued plate convergence after a subduction fails due to 

continental collision, leading to the formation of a new subduction out of the collision 

zone. Note that in the case of induced subduction initiation the plates are already 

converging before the new subduction forms. In Figure 2.3 it is shown how this 

continued convergence can trigger the formation of a new subduction zone. Two sub-

cases are distinguished: transference and polarity reversal. Induced initiation by 

transference occurs when a less dense buoyant continental bloc or submarine plateau 

approaches (or even enters) the subduction zone and causes it to fail. As consequence, a 

new subduction forms outboard of the collision zone (see fig. 2.3). Induced subduction 

by polarity reversal also occurs when a buoyant block approaches the trench. However, 

contrary to the transference case, the subduction nucleates in the original overriding 

plate (Stern, 2004).

Figure 2.3 – General classes, subclasses and examples of how subduction zones form (Extracted from 

Stern, 2004). 

 

In Figure 2.3 are also shown two possible ways for a subduction to initiate 

spontaneously: passive margin collapse and transform collapse. The first corresponds to 

the model of passive margin collapse due to density excess and sedimentary loading 

traditionally required for the closing phase of the Wilson cycle. In this examples 

convergence only start after the subduction, corresponding to a newly formed plate 

boundary, is completely developed. However, as mentioned above, it is known that 

lithosphere becomes more rigid with aging and thus this process requires some kind of 

weakening mechanism like serpentinization or the existence of a pre-fractured 

extensional zone, since lithosphere easily fails when subjected to traction forces 

(Clothing et al., 1989; Stern, 2004). Furthermore, Stern (2004) shows that there is no 

known example of spontaneous subduction nucleation in the Cenozoic, and that Pre-

Cenozoic examples should be avoided because the evidences are ambiguous and 

reconstructions more conjectural. Also, Mueller and Philips (1991) demonstrate that 

simple models of passive margin collapse cannot be quantitatively substantiated and are 

not evident in the geological record. Nevertheless, if plate tectonics started sometime in 

the Precambrian and plates are driven by slab pull at subduction zones, then 

spontaneous nucleation of at least one subduction zone is required to first set the plates 

in motion (Stern, 2004), unless there was a progressive transition mode, from the ?pre-



15 

 

plate-tectonics? regime to the present-day plate tectonics regime, in which segments of 

the lithosphere were already sinking in the asthenosphere.  

Figure 2.3 also shows another possible way for a spontaneous initiation of 

subduction: along a transform boundary or a fracture zone. This may occur when one of 

two juxtaposed plates collapse as consequence of density differences. However, recent 

geodynamical modeling carried out by Hall et al. (2003) demonstrate that this process 

requires a previous plate convergence of about 2 cm/yr to overcome plate strength 

(Stern, 2004).  

Nikolaeva et al. (2010) synthesized several previously proposed 

forces/mechanisms/processes besides slab pull and ridge push that could account for 

subduction initiation (Table 2.1), however, the ongoing debate on this topic in the 

scientific community is still far from a consensus. Some authors even proposed that 

subduction initiated on the Earth by exogenic processes such as meteorite impacts 

(Hansen, 2007). There is not even agreement on whether old passive margins constitute 

likely sites for subduction initiation, as required by the traditional closing phase of the 

Wilson cycle. Thus, the identification of an incipient subduction at a passive margin is 

one of the major challenges in the modern plate tectonics. A natural case study would 

permit to constrain the previously vast amount of proposed models and allow a better 

understanding of one of the most enigmatic processes on Earth: the formation of a 

subduction zone. In the present work, we explore the possibility of the Gulf of Cadiz 

tectonic setting as being one natural case of subduction initiation.

2.2. On the closure of the Atlantic Ocean 

  

The absence on Earth of oceanic crust older than 200 Ma, with the exception of 

a small portion of Tethyan crust in the eastern Mediterranean (Fig. 2.4), suggests that 

new subduction systems should initiate repeatedly (Goren et al., 2008). Passive margins 

are the reasonable place for trench formation since most of the existing subduction 

zones are located along continental margins (Goren et al., 2008; Nikolaeva et al., 2010). 

Also, the current state of relatively young oceanic lithosphere is best achieved by 

subducting the oldest oceanic lithosphere, which occurs at passive margins, before 

younger oceanic lithosphere (Goren et al., 2008; Nikolaeva et al., 2010).  

The oldest oceanic lithosphere in the Atlantic basin is about 170 Ma, preferably 

located near the passive margins that almost entirely bound this ocean (see Fig. 2.4). 

According to some authors, the Atlantic has already entered in its closing phase (e.g. 

Mueller and Philips, 1991; Ribeiro et al., 2006). In fact, there are already two places 

where Atlantic oceanic crust is being consumed in subduction zones: in the Scotia arc 

and in the Lesser Antilles arc (Deuser, 1970; Goren et al., 2008; see Figs. 1.1 and 2.4). 

These arcs may be the precursors of a system of convergence zones that might 

ultimately result in the closing of the Atlantic Ocean (Mueller and Philips, 1991).

2.2.1. The Scotia and Lesser Antilles arcs 

 

The Scotia and the Lesser Antilles arcs (see Fig. 1.1) seem to correspond to two 

cases of induced subduction initiation. Some authors proposed that once existed a 

continuous east deeping subduction system extending from NW American margin to the 

Antarctica (e.g. Goren et al., 2008; Fig. 2.5A). The two narrow continental landmasses 

existing between the Pacific and the Atlantic (marked with ellipses in Fig. 2.5) may 

have allowed the transmission of stress between basins, inducing the nucleation of two 

subduction zones in Atlantic domain (Fig. 2.5B). According with Mueller and Phillips 

(1991), in the Caribbean region the Pacific and Atlantic crust may even had been in 

direct contact by a corridor of oceanic crust generated during a rifting phase between 

North and South America. Goren et al. (2008) speculated that the nucleation of the 

Atlantic subductions was facilitated by the addition of water and melts into the upper 

continental plates, weakening it and reducing its viscosity (see Fig. 2.5C). Both the 

Scotia and the Lesser Antilles arcs then retreated around 2000 km to their present 

position. The subduction of Atlantic seafloor occurred simultaneously with seafloor 

spreading in the back-arcs. Having reached the open ocean, the advance across oceanic 

lithosphere is essentially unhampered because an almost limitless supply of negatively 

buoyant lithosphere is available to drive subduction (Royden, 1993).  

Mueller and Phillips (1991) used an interesting and, in accordance with the 

authors, particularly imaginative analogy. They consider that the introduction of 

subduction zones into a previously pristine oceanic basin (i.e. without subduction zones) 

might be viewed, figuratively, as a contagious process in which an ?infected? ocean (i.e. 

with subduction zones) infects an uninfected basin. Once that the first subduction zone 

has invaded the pristine ocean the potential to multiply and eradicate the entire basin 

clearly exists. The exact form by which this process may occur is still unclear and in 

some extent speculative. Nevertheless, two additional important characteristics of the 

Scotia and Lesser Antilles arcs are conspicuous. Firstly, both these arcs are retreating 

bounded by transform faults and trenches that do not seem to be propagating laterally 

(see Fig. 1.1.). Secondly, both the Scotia and Lesser Antilles arcs are propagating along 

two transform plate boundaries that connect the arcs to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (see 

Figs. 1.1 and 2.4). There is a striking similarity between these two arcs and the Gibraltar 

Arc (see Fig. 1.1), which is also connected to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge by the Azores-



19 

 

Gibraltar Fracture Zone, a transform plate limit extending from the Azores triple 

junction to the Gulf of Cadiz, the foreland of the Gibraltar Arc (see Figs. 1.1 and 1.2). 

This work investigates the possibility of this area to correspond to the third place where 

an initial stage of the subduction ?infection? process might be occurring at present, in 

accordance with some ideas addressed by Mueller and Phillips (1991) and Royden, 

(1993).

continuous subduction system to the west of the continents (marked by black triangles), and narrow 

continental masses (black ellipses). (b) Paleo-tectonic configuration of the Americas during middle 

Miocene, showing two new segments of subduction, the Lesser Antilles and South Sandwich (Scotia) 

arcs, to the east of the continents, correlated with the locations of the narrow continental strips. (c) 

Schematic model (proposed by Goren et al., 2008) of the lithosphere-asthenosphere structure along 

section AB as appears in plate a. Subduction beneath a narrow continental lithosphere is favorable for the 

development of lateral density contrast that may lead to low-angle subduction. Subduction system with 

east dipping slab is active to the west of a narrow strip of continental lithosphere. Water and melts 

induced by the active subduction infiltrate into the upper continental plate, weaken it and reduce its 

density and viscosity. As a result, a density contrast develops between the narrow continental lithosphere 

and the oceanic lithosphere to its east. Then, low-angle subduction to the east of the continent with a west 

dipping slab may develop (Extracted and adapted from Goren et al., 2008).

2.2.2. The Gibraltar Arc and West Portuguese Margin 

 

The subduction zone now present beneath the Gibraltar Arc developed within 

the Mediterranean Alpine Collision Belt and is a remnant of the subduction system that 

consumed most of the Western Mediterranean Tethyan Ocean (see bellow section 2.3). 

Royden et al. (1993) suggested that this subduction is still retreating westwards toward 

Atlantic domain (see Fig., 1.1). This idea was at the time somehow speculative and 

lacking the support of geophysical data. Also, further works presented by Lonergan and 

White (1997) and Maldonado et al. (1999) suggested that the subduction was inactive 

since Miocene times. The idea of a present day active slab roll back was re-introduced 

by Gutscher et al. (2002) who related the existence of an east dipping slab below the 

Gibraltar Arc (Bijwaard and Spakman, 2000) to the presence of a west verging 

accretionary wedge (GCAW) in the Atlantic domain (see Figs. 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4). The 

authors proposed that the slab is retreating along an East-West corridor of oceanic 

lithosphere that once connected the Tethyan and the Atlantic oceanic basins (Fig. 2.6; 

see section 2.3). Several authors still argue that the Gibraltar subduction system is no 

longer active (e.g. Zitellini et al., 2009) or that it had diminished dramatically its activity 

since latest Miocene times (Terrinha et al., 2009). According to Terrinha et al. (2009), 

the present stress regime caused the migration of the deformation from the realm of the 

GCAW to the west (onto the Horseshoe fault region; Fig. 2.7) and to the north along the 

West Portuguese Margin. The 300 km long NE–SW trending fault system (Horseshoe, 

Marquês do Pombal, Gorringe and Tagus Abyssal Plain faults; see Figs. 2.7 and 1.2) is 

considered by the authors as the expression of the propagation of a new compressive 

deformation front, which will eventually lead to the nucleation of a West Iberian 

subduction zone, as proposed by Ribeiro et al. (1996; Fig. 2.8). In addition, the 

tomography data presented in Gutscher et al. (2002) suggests that the Horseshoe Fault 

may penetrate at least till 100 km in the lithosphere. On the other hand, Masson et al. 

(1994) also speculated that subduction may be nucleating further north in the Iberian 

Abyssal Plain ocean-continent transition (see Fig. 2.8). Here a thinned rifted crust is 

overlying a body of serpentinized peridotite. Serpentinization can provide an efficient 

weakening mechanism that may facilitate lithospheric rupture and subduction initiation 

(Cloetingh et al., 1984; Masson et al., 1994)

2.2.3. Was the 1755 Great Lisbon Earthquake triggered in a 

subduction zone? 

 

 The 1755 Great Lisbon Earthquake had an estimated magnitude of 8.5 to 8.9 and 

is one of the highest magnitude earthquakes in the history of Europe (Johnston, 1996; 

Batista et al., 1998). Several structures were proposed to be the source of this 

earthquake: e.g. the Gorringe Bank (Johnston, 1996), the Marquês de Pombal fault 

(Zitellini et al., 2001) and the Tagus Valley fault (Vilanova et al., 2003). However, the 

empirical relationships proposed by Wells and Coppersmith (1994) indicate that such 

release of elastic energy requires a rupture area of approximately 27,000 km
2
 and a fault 

length of around 370 km (Gutscher et al., 2009a). Since the above structures are not 

long enough to produce such energy (see Figs. 2.7 and 1.2), they were progressively 

abandoned as possible sources. To overcome this difficulty, other models proposed the 



22 

 

existence of two faults acting simultaneously to generate the 1755 event by adding up 

their rupture areas: e.g. the Marquês de Pombal fault and the Horseshoe fault (Terrinha 

et al., 2003; Gràcia et al., 2003a,b; see Fig. 2.7) and the Marquês de Pombal Fault and 

the Guadalquivir Bank Fault (Baptista et al., 2003). Also, Zitellini et al. (2009) proposed 

a possible link between the Horseshoe and the SWIM faults that together can comprise 

in total more than 400 km of connected fault segments (see Fig. 1.2). This last 

hypothesis was investigated in detail by Rosas et al (submitted) and is also part of the 

work involved in this PhD project (see appendix).

23 

 

Alternatively, Gutscher et al. (2002) and Gutscher (2004) proposed that the 1755 

Great Lisbon Earthquake was generated in the Gibraltar subduction fault plane. Their 

argument was mostly based on extensive geological and geophysical data, but also in 

the fact that most of the large magnitude earthquakes (M?8.5) are generated in 

subduction zones. Accordingly, 11 of the 12 greatest earthquakes (M?8.5) of the past 

100 years occurred along subduction fault planes (the exception was a magnitude 8.6 

earthquake in the Himalaya collision belt). However, the Gulf of Cadiz subduction fault 

plane shows negligible instrumental high magnitude seismic events. Gutscher et al. 

(2006) offers three possible explanation for such an absence: (1) the subduction is 

inactive and has ceased; (2) the subduction is active, but aseismic; (3) the subduction is 

active and a locked seimogenic zone exists, gradually accumulating stress until it 

releases the next great earthquake, a similar behavior as the Nankai (SW Japan), 

Cascadia (NW USA), and Northern Sumatra (Indonesia) subduction zones. Based on 

recently acquired seafloor and GPS data the authors favor the last hypothesis.  

Ribeiro et al. (2006) agree that the source mechanism of such a large earthquake 

requires generation at a subduction zone. However, they proposed that the source was 

not the Gibraltar subduction, but an incipient subduction zone that is presently 

developing in the West Iberia Margin (Fig. 2.8). Also Terrinha et al. (2009) proposed 

that the Horseshoe, Marquês de Pombal and Tagus Abyssal Plain compressive 

structures (the crustal expression of this hypothetical incipient subduction zone; see Fig. 

2.7) may be linked at depth and thus providing a possible and reliable source 

mechanism for the generation of the 1755 Great Lisbon Earthquake.

2.3. The Gulf of Cadiz geodynamic evolution 

 

The tectonic features present in the Gulf of Cadiz (see Fig. 1.2) are the result of 

a complex tectonic evolution including rifting, compression and strike-slip motion 

between Africa and Eurasia since the Triassic (Wilson et al., 1989; Dewey et al., 1989; 

Maldonado et al., 1999; Terrinha et al., 2009). During the Mesozoic, this area was part 

of the more occidental Alpine-Tethys rift system (see Fig. 2.9) that comprised an 

oceanic domain separating two newly formed passive margins. (Dercourt et al., 1986; 

Sanz de Galdeano, 1990; Srivastava et al, 1990a; 1990b; Maldonado et al., 1999; 

Stampli et al., 2002). This domain included several spreading axes and transform faults 

that formed as result of the extensional reactivation of Variscan structures (Terrinha, 

1998).

Figure 2.9 – Reconstructions of the Western Tethyan realm in the Aptian, Lower Cretaceous (~120 Ma.). 

Note the position of the Iberian Peninsula at the left top, before initiating its Cretaceous 35º 

counterclockwise rotation (Stampli et al., 2002).  

 

In the Eocene-Oligocene most of the Gulf of Cadiz (and SW Iberia) Mesozoic 

rifting faults were tectonically inverted as the result of the convergence between Africa 

and Eurasia that started in the Upper Cretaceous (Terrinha et al., 2009). This 

convergence was accommodated by northwards dipping subduction of the Alpine-

Tethys oceanic lithosphere that extended from the SE Iberia to the Alps (see Fig. 2.10; 

Rehault et al., 1985; Malinverno and Ryan, 1986; Dewey et al., 1989; Rosenbaum et al., 

2002; Jolivet et al., 2006). Since the Oligocene, the continental collision in the Alps 

absorbed the bulk compression of the Africa-Eurasia convergence, as consequence, the 

northwards Alpine-Tethys subduction along Europe‘s meridional margin slowed down 

and became primarily driven by the density collapse of the subducting oceanic slab 

(op.cit). This, triggered slab roll-back, which led to the formation of the West 

Mediterranean back-arc basins and associated continental terranes, among which the 

Betic-Rif (Figs. 2.10 and 2.11; Rosenbaum et al., 2002, 2004). Concomitantly, the 

convergence direction between Africa and Eurasia in the western Mediterranean region 

rotated progressively from the N-S to WNW-ESE (Maldonado et al., 1999; Fernandes et 

al., 2003; Fernandes, 2004). 



26 

 

 

 

Figure 2.10 – Reconstructions of the Western Mediterranean region in the Oligocene (~30 Ma.; 

Rosenbaum et al., 2002).  Note the existence of an oceanic corridor connecting the Tethyan Liguarian 

Ocean to the Atlantic and the position of the northwest dipping subduction before it started to retreat. 

 

In the Middle Miocene, the continuation of the southwestwards drifting of the 

Alboran terrane (see Fig. 2.11) led to its collision with the SE Iberia and NW Africa 

forming the Gibraltar Arc (see Fig. 2.11; also known as Betic-Rif Arc). In the 

Tortonian, the westward overthrusting of the Gibraltar Arc into Atlantic domain led to 

the emplacement of an accretionary wedge in the Gulf of Cadiz (GCAW; see Figs. 1.2, 

2.6 and 2.11; Lonergan and White, 1997; Gutscher et al., 2002). It was recently 

confirmed by geodetic data that the Gibraltar Arc region is moving westward at a rate of 

ca. 3.5 mm/yr relatively to Iberia (Fadil et al., 2006; Stich et al., 2006; Tahayt et al., 

2008). According to Gutscher et al. (2002; 2009a) this movement is a consequence of 

the active roll back of the east dipping oceanic slab that still exists between the Iberia 

and Africa plates as imaged by teleseismic tomography (Gutscher et al., 2002; Spakman 

and Wortel, Transmed Atlas, 2004). The existence of Tethyan oceanic lithosphere in the 

Gulf of Cadiz beneath the accretionary wedge was recently confirmed using seismic 

refraction data (Sallarès et al., 2011). This oceanic corridor can provide a path for the 

subduction hinge retreat further west. 

Presently, the Gulf of Cadiz region experiences a large scale NW to WNW 

directed convergence between Nubia and Iberia, at a rate of ca. 4 mm/yr (Argus et al., 

1989; DeMets et al., 1994; Sella et al., 2002; Calais et al., 2003; Fernandes et al., 2003; 



27 

 

Fernandes, 2004; Nocquet and Calais, 2004; Fernandes et al., 2007). A general strain 

partitioning scenario (Terrinha et al., 2009) considers this convergence to be 

accommodated both along the WNW-ESE dextral strike-slip faults (including the 

SWIM faults), and along NE-SW westwards thrust faults, such as the Horseshoe, 

Marquês de Pombal and Tagus Abyssal Plain faults and the Gorringe Bank northern 

thrust (see Figs.1.2 and 2.7).

Chapter 3 
Methods and data 

 

Due to the oceanic water column, direct access to the sea floor and underlying 

crust is very difficult. Therefore nearly all tectonic studies in marine environment 

require the use of geophysical methods. The present work was done based on the 

combined analysis and interpretation of ca. 180,000 km
2
 of high-resolution multibeam 

swath bathymetry and more than 20,700 km of multi-channel seismic reflection profiles. 

The combination of bathymetric data and interpretation of the main tectonic structures 

in the seismic lines was the basis for a thorough morphotectonic characterization of the 

main structural features of the Gulf of Cadiz, which resulted in the production of a new 

tectonic map of the region (see next chapter). Based on this new map several 

geotectonic models regarding the interpretation of the tectonic evolution of the Gulf of 

Cadiz were proposed. Different assumptions of these interpretations were tested using 

sandbox analogue modeling experiments. The obtained results provided new insights 

regarding several problems at stake, and, I hope, progress in the understanding of the 

tectonics of this key segment of the Iberia-Nubia plate boundary.

3.1. Bathymetric data 

 

 The used high-resolution bathymetric dataset was produced under the European 

Science Foundation EuroMargins SWIM project (acronym for ?earthquake and tsunami 

hazards of active faults at the South West Iberian Margin: deep structure, high-

resolution imaging and paleoseismic signature?; Fig. 3.1). This project promoted a 

collaborative research agreement to coordinate marine cruises with the goal of acquiring 

new bathymetric data and making all existent data of the Gulf of Cadiz region available 

to the whole scientific community.  It resulted from the compilation of 19 surveys over 

200 days ship time, performed between 2000 and 2006 by teams belonging to 14 

research institutions from 7 European countries (Table 3.1). Each institution provided 

data files and Digital Terrain Models (DTM) at a 100 m grid spacing in order to produce 

the SWIM multibeam compilation published and available online in Zitellini et al. 

(2009). Interpretation was made using terrain analysis techniques and image analysis of 

the bathymetry using commercial software, ArcGIS and Fledermaus.

3.2. Seismic reflection data 

  

 The multi-channel seismic reflection (MCS) database used in this work was 

compiled under the NEAREST project (acronym for ?Integrated observations from 

NEAR shore sourcES of Tsunamis: towards an early warning system?), co-founded by 

the European Commission. The MCS profiles were acquired in the Gulf of Cadiz and 

Western Iberia Margin, from 1992 through 2006, during the geophysical missions: 

ARRIFANO, IAM, BIGSETS, VOLTAIRE, SISMAR and SWIM 2006 (Fig. 3.2). They 

were later imported into a data management and interpretation software suite from 

Landmark Corporation (OpenWorks, SeisWorks and ZMap-plus) at the laboratory of 

seismic data of the Unit of Marine Geology of the National Laboratory of Energy and 

Geology (LNEG – Portuguese acronym). Information on acquisition parameters and 

geometry of these profiles is summarized in Table 3.2. All the MCS profiles were 

analyzed and interpreted in order to produce the new tectonic map presented in the next 

chapter. Two single channel seismic profiles (PSAT 244 and 246) and a 24 channel 

DELSIS profile were also used in Chapter 5 (Duarte et al., 2010) and in Chapter 6 

(Duarte et al., submitted), respectively.

3.3. Analogue Modeling 

 

Physical (analogue) modeling is the study of natural tectonic processes by means 

of simplified scaled models in laboratory. Physical modeling makes use of different 

materials, mostly granular and viscous with known properties, as analogues of natural 

rocks. The materials are chosen in order to fulfill the ?similarity criteria?, i.e. their 

physical parameters and properties are chosen to mimic geometric, kinematic and 

dynamic natural conditions (Hubbert, 1937; Ramberg, 1967). The similarity criteria is 

achieved by scaling the model through an dimensional analysis assuring that the 

dimension, velocities and forces in the model are proportional to those in the prototype. 

The purpose of analogue modeling is not simply to reproduce the natural prototype 



34 

 

(nature observations), but to test by controlled experiments hypotheses as to the driving 

mechanism of the tectonic processes (Ranalli, 2001).   

In the study of nature it is only possible to access the final stage of a tectonic 

process, and attempt to reconstruct the possible chronological sequence of events that 

led to that final stage (Eulerian approach). The major advantage of analogue modeling is 

that it allows to simulate and test different possibilities of evolution of the original 

prototype, i.e. to reproduce in laboratory sequences of chronological events that may 

have led to that specific final stage (Lagrangian approach), at a suitable geometric scale 

and time ratio (Ramberg, 1967). This is of special importance because different 

sequence of events may lead to the same final stage. Also, the fact of laboratory models 

being three dimensional make it a powerful tool in the gain of a qualitative mechanical 

intuition of the processes at stake and the thorough identification of patterns of 

repeatability. Ideally, analogue modeling should be complemented with numerical 

modeling, which allows a more efficient thermo-mechanical and analytical approach.  

In this work analogue modeling experiments were produced to better understand 

the deformation patterns resulting from thrust-wrench fault interference in the study 

area. These experiments revealed to be crucial in the understanding of the driven 

mechanism that account for the observed structures present in the Gulf of Cadiz. The 

experiments were designed according to fallowing steps:  

1. Identification of a key problem; 

2. Determination of the materials that satisfy the similarity criteria (scaling); 

3. Building of the apparatus given the chosen scale; 

4. Running the experiments; 

5. Verification of the repeatability patterns of salient observables; 

6. Interpretation of the obtained results; 

7. Elaboration of a generalized explanatory theory or conceptual model 

integrating the experimental results in coherent framework; 

8. Finally, integrate the modeling outcomes into the broader geodynamical 

evolution model of the studied area. 

Since this work is partially organized in research papers and in order to avoid 

repetitions, all the experimental problematic, scaling, materials and used apparatus is 

provided in the respective analogue modeling chapters and papers.

Chapter 4 
The Gulf of Cadiz main tectonic 

features 
 

 In the last two decades several efforts were made to produce a tectonic map of 

the Gulf of Cadiz active structures (e.g. Tortella et al., 1997; Medialdea et al., 2004; 

Iribarren et al., 2007; Zitellini et al., 2009; Fig. 4.1). Most of these maps were done 

using one recently acquired MCS dataset or in other cases using datasets that covered 

the study area in a non systematic manner. Usually the MCS surveys were obtained for 

thematic studies and not for the overall mapping of the Gulf of Cadiz. The novelty of 

the map presented in this work (Fig. 4.2) is that it was made by a thorough review of a 

multi-survey dataset (six MCS surveys) coupled with the analysis of the recently 

compiled high resolution bathymetry, which provided detailed morpho-tectonic 

information at the scale of the whole study area (see previous chapter).  This map 

benefited from the existence of a stratigraphic model by Roque (2007) which correlated

The map shown in Fig. 4.2 depicts the Gulf of Cadiz - SW Iberia main active 

tectonic structures. Three main systems of structures are promptly recognized: i) the 

subduction-related Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge (CGAW; marked in grey in Fig. 

4.2); ii) a set of WNW-ESE striking dextral strike-slip faults (the SWIM fault system; 

marked in white); and a group of NE-SW striking northwest-directed thrusts located in 

the Southwest Iberia Margin (marked in yellow). These three systems are described in 

separated sections below. Other noteworthy structures depicted in the map of Fig. 4.2, 

such as the more ENE-WSW thrusts and the Cadiz fault, will also be briefly described 

in a fourth section.

The tectonic map was made using an extensive dataset of stratigraphically 

calibrated seismic reflection profiles (see Fig. 3.2). However, the seismic sections 

presented in this Chapter aim only to illustrate the main studied features and not to be an 

exhaustive characterization of all the structures present in the Gulf of Cadiz. Specially, 

because a significant part of these structures were previously characterized with some 

detail in previous works (e.g. Gutscher et al., 2002; 2009a,b; Gracia et al., 2003a,b; 

Terrinha et al., 2003; Zitelini et al., 2004; Cunha et al., 2010) some of which included in 

other chapters and appendixes of this thesis (Terrinha et al., 2009; Duarte et al., 2009; 

Rosas et al., 2009; Duarte et al., 2010; Duarte et al., submitted; Rosas et al., submitted). 

The adopted simplified stratigraphy is shown in Figure 4.3 (after Torelli et al., 1997; 

Tortella et al., 1997; and Roque, 2007). In general, it is possible to identify three basic 

variations (A, B and C in Fig. 4.3) of a stratigraphic column constituted by three main 

tectono-stratigraphic mega-sequences: i) a succession of mostly Mesozoic sediments, 

occasionally with some units extending through the Eocene-Oligocene, overlying a 

basement of oceanic nature, with exception of the Gorringe Bank, a region where 

sediments lay directly on top of serpentinized mantle; ii) Miocene sediments often 

exhibiting a chaotic acoustic facies, including the Chaotic Body (which may locally 

incorporate sediments of Eocene-Oligocene age) and the GCAW; iii) an overlying 

succession of mostly Pliocene-Quaternary sediments. Some degree of stratigraphic 

lateral variations may occur between profiles or even within the same profile.

4.1. The Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge 

 

The Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge (GCAW) is one of the most prominent 

morphological features depicted in the high-resolution bathymetry, occupying a 

significant area of the Gulf of Cadiz (see Figs. 4.2 and 4.4). It is materialized on the 

seafloor by a west dipping U-shaped surface that extends for more than 250 km from 

about longitude 7º to 9º30‘, with depths ranging from 200 to 4300 meters. It narrows 

slightly to the west with a width varying from 160 to 140 km. Its northeastern limit is 

marked by the Cadiz fault (see Fig. 4.2 and 4.4; Duarte et al., 2009) and the Iberian 

continental shelf. The northwestern part is limited by the uplifted continental slope of 

the Portuguese margin, an area dominated by the presence of plateaus incised by 

canyons and submarine valleys (see Fig. 4.2 and 4.4). The southern limit of the GCAW 

is well marked by the Rharb Valley that extends from the Moroccan continental shelf to 

the Seine Abyssal Plain. To the west, the rim of the wedge corresponds to the eastern 

limit of the Horseshoe Valley and the Seine Abyssal Plain. In this region, it is possible 

to observe that the wedge deformation front is asymmetrically indented by the Coral 

Patch Ridge (see Fig. 4.4; see Gutscher et al., 2009a).

surface and adjacent areas (Adapted from Duarte et al., submitted) 

 



39 

 

The present morphology of the GCAW is the result of the activity of a wide 

variety of tectonic, gravitational and fluid escape processes. The particular wrinkled 

appearance of its surface comprises thrust-related slope breaks and associated folds, 

?raft-tectonics? type features, abundant sub-circular collapse depressions and several 

mud volcanoes and salt domes (Torelli et al., 1997; Mulder et al., 2003; Pinheiro et al., 

2003; Gutscher et al., 2009b; Terrinha et al., 2009; Zitellini et al., 2009). From a 

structural point of view, the GCAW corresponds to an eastward thickening pile of 

westwards thrusted sediments (Fig. 4.5), reaching a maximum thickness of ca. 15 km 

near the Gibraltar Straits (Thiebot and Gutscher, 2006; Gutscher et al., 2009a). The 

thrusts are rooted in a common sub-horizontal to gently east dipping décollement layer, 

exhibiting an overall geometry interpreted as compatible with on-going eastwards 

subduction beneath the Gibraltar Arc (Gutscher et al., 2002). During the last 5 Ma the 

E-W convergence rate implied in such a subduction is thought to have diminished from 

ca. 2 cm/yr to 0.5 cm/yr (Gutscher et al., 2009a), with a consequent decrease in the 

activity of the wedge thrusts during this time span. Accordingly, the same authors argue 

that the Present day internal deformation is more likely to be accommodated by small 

increments of local reactivation of inherited blind thrusts, being more homogeneously 

distributed over the entire wedge rather than concentrated on newly formed major 

frontal thrusts disrupting the seafloor. However, a detailed study of the Horseshoe 

Valley region (see Fig. 4.2), presented in the next chapter (Duarte et al., 2010), suggests 

that the accretionary is still propagating to the west.

deformation front; see stratigraphic column C in Fig. 4.3 for correlation of the observed seismic units (see

4.2. The SWIM fault system 

 

The SWIM fault system is a group of WNW-ESE striking subvertical faults 

extending along 600 km from the eastern part of the Gulf of Cadiz to the southern limit 

of the Gorringe Bank (see Fig. 4.2). These tectonic features seemingly interfere with 

several different morphotectonic domains such as the GCAW, the Horseshoe Valley and 

the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain (see Fig. 4.6). The morphologic expression of the SWIM 

faults corresponds to a more or less continuous alignment of seafloor crests and troughs 

with wavelengths of the order of tens of kilometers, sometimes exhibiting an en echelon 

geometrical disposition (Fig. 4.6), and commonly punctuated by active mud volcanoes 

within the domain of the accretionary wedge (see Fig. 4.2) and possibly just outboard to 

the west. The linear morphologic expression of the SWIM faults is more prominent both 

close to the northern part of the accretionary wedge deformation front and in the 

Horseshoe Valley (Fig. 4.7 and 4.8), where the lineament corresponding to the 

morphological expression of the SWIM 1 fault can be followed almost continuously for 

about 200 kilometers and the width of the affected area is of a few hundred metres. In 

some segments of this lineaments is possible to identify undulations, striking E-W, with 

maximum lengths of about 8 km. These features also show an ?en echelon? pattern that 

was interpreted to correspond to NE-SW oriented folds of the Recent sedimentary cover 

(see Fig. 4.8; Rosas et al., 2009, in appendix). Despite the fact that the lineaments can 

sometimes exhibit some continuity reaching more than 200 km, this does not mean that 

the underlying faults are strictly continuous and connected. Quite on the contrary, the 

lineaments seem to be controlled by a discontinuous alignment of deep rooted faults 

probably resulting from a complex tectonic evolution (see text below and Chapter 6 for 

a more detailed discussion). Also note that in this work there are noteworthy 

discrepancies in the interpretations of these structures. This results from the fact that the 

earliest interpretations of the SWIM strike-slip faults were done using limited 

bathymetry datasets, which did not allow an accurate cartography and sometimes led to 

misleading or alternative interpretations. With the increasing availability of new 

bathymetry data (and MCS profiles), the interpretations were progressively upgraded. In 

addition, other authors proposed different interpretations for the SWIM fault system 

(e.g. Zitellini et al., 2009). The upgraded tectonic map presented in Fig. 4.2 intends to 

include the more recent interpretation of these features, though with some degree of 



41 

 

simplification due to the scale adopted. The different sections of this manuscript and 

associated papers may present alternative or simplified interpretations of these same 

(SWIM) features.

white correspond to the ?corner faults? formed as the result of the interference between the Horseshoe 

fault and the SWIM 1 fault shown in Fig. 4.9 (see Rosas et al., submitted, in appendix, for a detailed 

discussion on the origin of these structures). 

 

The coupled inspection of the bathymetric dataset and seismic profiles allowed 

the mapping of the overall extent of the SWIM structures (Terrinha et al., 2009; Rosas 

et al., 2009; Duarte et al., 2009; Duarte et al., 2010). The seismic data showed that the 

lineaments correspond to the morphological expression of more or less aligned arrays of 

deep-rooted faults, often breaching out through Present day seafloor sediments (Fig. 4.9; 

Rosas et al., 2009; Terrinha et al., 2009; Duarte et al., submitted; Rosas et al, 

submitted).

location in Fig. 4.7: Adapted from Duarte et al., submitted), crosscutting the SWIM faults 1 and 2.  Rosas 

et al. (submitted) presented an alternative interpretation for the structure corresponding to the SWIM 2, 

according to these authors it may correspond to a corner thrust formed as the result of the interference 

between the Horseshoe fault and the SWIM 1 fault (note in Fig. 4.7 that the two structures seem to merge 

in this area). Stratigraphy corresponding approximately to the column B in Fig. 4.3. Black dashed lines –

and Roque (2007).  

 

From the inspection of the IAM 3 and 4 seismic profiles in Fig. 4.9 it is evident 

that the SWIM faults are aligned along basement normal faults controlling the geometry 

of the Mesozoic sediments. These faults are interpreted as being formed during the 

Mesozoic rifting events. This interpretation is supported by the presence of a growth 

wedge contemporaneous of a normal movement (Fig. 4.10 - Unit B). In this figure it 

also possible to observe that the SWIM 2 structure was reactivated, after the extensional 

event, with southwards reverse movement given that the growth wedge is over-thrust 



45 

 

towards the southwest. The thrusting seems to be contemporaneous of the emplacement 

of the accretionary wedge (Unit D and D‘) since this clearly tapers towards the 

northeast. From the inspection of the seismic profiles it is possible to observe that the 

SWIM 2 fault deforms the Pliocene-Quaternary units, breaching through the seafloor. It 

is also noticeable that the more recent cover sediments are strongly deformed mostly to 

the south of the SWIM 2 (see Unit E in Fig. 4.10), suggesting that this sub-vertical fault 

corresponds to the present deformation limit of the accretionary wedge in this area. 

 

Figure 4.10 – Multi-channel seismic reflection profile IAM GC2 (see Fig. 4.7 for location). The white 

dashed line mark the SWIM 2 fault zone. The profile shows two previous movements along this structure 

(normal and reverse, white open and closed arrows, respectively).  A - Basement; B - Growing wedge 

(Mesozoic age); C - Post-rift unit (Meso-Cenozoic age); D and D‘ - Accretionary Wedge unit (Miocene 

age to Pliocene-Quaternary); E - Cover unit (Pliocene-Quaternary age). D‘ corresponds to the unit 

emplaced during late Miocene, while the deposition of unit D continued to more recent times (Adapted 

from Duarte et al., 2009, in appendix).  

 

Rosas et al. (2009; in appendix), based on the age of the sedimentary units and in 

the en echelon folding geometry (see Fig. 4.8), estimated that the SWIM faults dextral 

strike-slip reactivation in the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain and Horseshoe Valley may had 

initiated at ca. 1.8 Ma ago. This is in agreement with the recent kinematic models 

derived from geodetic observations, indicating that the ca. 4 mm/yr Present day 

convergence between Nubia and Iberia is subparallel to these faults. In fact the present 

convergence direction is the most reliable (indirect) observation supporting the 



46 

 

interpretation of the SWIM faults as dextral strike-slip faults. Although, dextral offsets 

of other structures along the SWIM faults are sparse. For instance, the Horseshoe Fault 

has two segments that seem to be offset by one structure with the same direction of the 

SWIM faults (see Fig. 4.2 and 4.11). However, both the SWIM faults and the Horseshoe 

fault are presently active and thus complex thrust-wrench interference patterns are 

expected to occur, which appear to be the case in this region, as reported by Rosas et al. 

(submitted, in appendix). Also, in the region of the Coral Patch Thrust Front (see Fig. 

4.2 and 4.11) some of the active thrusts appear to be delimited and displaced along the 

SWIM faults. However, this displacement is most probably false, since it completely 

vanishes onto the Coral Patch Ridge. Here, the thrusts are most likely using the SWIM 

anisotropies as lateral ramps, since they clearly bound major thrusts without an obvious 

offset. Another important observation is that the SWIM faults do not displace the front 

of the accretionary wedge (see Fig. 4.11), which should be expected if the front of the 

wedge was nearly inactive since the Miocene as suggested by Zitellini et al. (2009). 

This is a major paradox in this area and will be investigated in detail in Chapter 6 

(Duarte et al., submitted).

4.3. The NE-SW thrusts 

 

The approximately NE-SW striking thrust system comprises the Horseshoe fault, 

the Marquês de Pombal fault, the Tagus Abyssal Plain fault and the Gorringe northern 

thrust (Fig. 4.12; see e.g. Zitellini et al., 1999; Gràcia et al., 2003a,b; Terrinha et al., 

2003; Rovere et al., 2004; Zitellini et al., 2004; Terrinha et al., 2009; Cunha et al., 

2010). This system extends for approximately 300 km from near the contact with the 

Coral Patch Ridge (35.5ºN), towards the north, along the West Portuguese Margin until 

a latitude of ~38ºN. These compressive structures correspond in general to deep rooted 

basement faults with prominent escarpments, possible cutting the lithosphere at 

different levels, as attested by seismic imagery and deep instrumental seismicity (see 

e.g. Fig. 1.4A; Stich et al., 2007; Terrinha et al., 2009; Cunha et al., 2010; Silva et al., 

2010).

4.3.1. The Horseshoe Fault 

 

The Horseshoe fault extends for about 100 km, bounding to the East the 

Horseshoe Abyssal Plain (see Fig. 4.12). The fault scarp is only well developed on its 

nothern segment, where it reaches a height of about 1000 meters. The southern segment 

of the Horseshoe scarp is being eroded by the South Portuguese canyons drainage 

system and widsepred mass transport processes (Terrinha et al., 2009, in appendix; 

Duarte et al., 2010, next chapter). Close to the intersection with the SWIM structures the 

trace of the fault becomes less evident and appears to interfere with the SWIM faults 

(see also Figs. 4.6, 4.7 and 4.11 and Rosas et al., submitted, in appendix). To the south, 

the Horseshoe fault probably connects with the Coral Patch thrusts. To the north, the 

fault split in several branches, where a couple of associated back-thrust are also 

recognized. Here, the fault seems to terminate against a small WNW-ESE thrust. 

Nevertheless, a relatively minor fault (the S. Vicente fault) can be traced northwards 

along the S. Vicente canyon. The IAM-4e seismic profile (Fig. 4.13) crosscuts the 

Horseshoe fault around shot point 1000. The fault is clearly imaged as a SE dipping, 

deep seated fault, rooting well into the basement (possible through Moho), prolonging 

upwards across the overlying units, and breaching out at the seafloor, where a resulting 

prominent deformation is marked by an offset of ca. ~0.6s TWT. The NW directed 

thrusting kinematics is clearly shown by the geometry of the folds affecting the 

Mesozoic, and by the unambiguous offset of the surface marking the top of the 

Mesozoic unit (see Fig. 4.13). To the SE of the Horseshoe fault, other relatively minor 

thrusts affecting the basal Mesozoic unit were previously described (e.g. Terrinha et al., 

2009, in appendix; Duarte et al., 2010, next chapter), although these only affect the base 

of the overlying chaotic body, lacking any kind of bathymetric expression (see Fig. 

4.13).  The same authors also report some degree of tectonic imbrication within the 

Miocene chaotic body further to SE, perturbing the seafloor morphology and controlling 

the formation of a group of ?crescentic? depressions (see Duarte et al., 2010 - Chapter 5 

for a detailed discussion on the origin of these features).

décollement.

4.3.2. The Marquês de Pombal Fault 

 

 The Marquês de Pombal fault strikes close to N-S, parallel to the Portuguese 

coast line, extending for about 60 km (see Fig. 4.12). It has a prominent scarp reaching a 

maximum height of about 1800 meters, limiting a submarine plateau. The BS-22 

seismic section (Fig. 4.14) shows that the Marquês de Pombal fault also roots deep in 

the basement, probably throughout the Moho. It is also possible to observe that the fault 

breaches out at the seafloor, offsetting the entire sedimentary cover by ~1.5 seconds. 

The NW directed thrusting kinematics is clearly shown by the geometry of the folds 

affecting the Meso-Cenozoic sedimentary sequence (see Fig. 4.14).  

To the south of the Marquês de Pombal structure two blind northwest-directed 

thrusts were also identified (see Fig. 4.12), presenting an en echelon disposition in 

relation both to the Marquês de Pombal and Horseshoe faults. It is not clear if all these 

faults are connected in depth to a common décollement level or if they are linked by 

lateral ramps, and thus forming a single complex structure.

that the sequence of Meso-Cenozoic sediments is overlaying a thinned crustal continental basement 

(Cunha et al., 2010).  

 

 



51 

 

4.3.3. The Tagus Abyssal Plain Fault 

 

The Tagus Abyssal Plain fault extends for about 70 km with a prominent but 

rather irregular scarp (see Fig. 4.12), reaching a maximum height of about 1500 meters. 

The scarp is steeper close to its southern tip and smoothing progressively towards the 

north, where manifestations of mass transport processes are observed. The BS-11 

seismic section (Fig. 4.15) shows that the fault zone corresponds to a basement rooted 

east deeping thrust, offsetting the seafloor and the cover units by ca. 1 second. In the 

imaged segment of the profile, associated with the Tagus Abyssal Plain fault, it is also 

possible to observe two west dipping back-thrusts limiting a slightly asymmetric 

anticline. Toward the southern part of the profile minor anticlines controlled by faults 

affecting the Meso-Cenozoic units are also observed. Among the four reported NE-SW 

thrust structures, the Tagus Abyssal Plain fault is the one with less instrumental 

seismicity (see Fig. 1.4 and Fig 4.17 below). Also, the inspection of available seismic 

profile shows recent sediments (darker top reflectors in Fig. 4.15) onlapping the fault 

scarp, which suggests that the peak activity of this segment of the Tagus Abyssal Plain 

Fault was in the Upper Pliocene. Present day deformation seems to be preferentially 

accommodated in the back-thrusts that cut through the seafloor

4.3.4. The Gorringe Northern Thrust 

 

The Gorringe Bank is the most impressive feature present in the SW Portuguese 

Margin (see Fig. 4.12), believed to be constituted by exhumed highly serpentinized 

mantle peridotites (Girardeau et al., 1998). The northern flank of the Gorringe Bank is 

limited by a major thrust (the Gorringe northern thrust), that extends for about 130 km, 

upthrusting the seafloor from ?5000 m to ?24 m. The fault scarp is highly sharp and 

steep (~10º). A major mass transport scar and correspondent deposit is observed in the 

northern segment of the fault attesting for its recent activity. The IAM-4 seismic section 

(Fig. 4.16) shows that the Gorringe northern thrust bounds a short flank of a major 

northwest vergent asymmetric anticline, comprising the entire Gorringe Bank structure. 

This fault probably roots very deep in the basement since it offsets the seafloor in about 

6 seconds, in an area of oceanic domain. Despite the general westward vergence of the 

Gorringe, some eastwards vergent back-thrust-related folds can be detected, particularly 

in the base of its southern flank. In the northern segment of the profile a wedge of an 

acoustic chaotic unit is clearly observed, progressively thickening towards the north 

flank of the Gorringe Bank. This wedge corresponds to a gravity unit believed to have 

formed in a period of paroxysmal tectonic activity during the late Oligocene-Miocene 

age (Sartori et al., 1994; Tortella et al., 1997; Terrinha et al., 2009; Jimenez-Munt et al., 

2010). Since then, the Gorringe has undergone a minimum shortening of 20 to 50 km 

(Hayward et al., 1999; Jimenez-Munt et al., 2010). The present activity of the Gorringe 

Northern Thrust is attested by a cluster of instrumental seismicity (see Fig. 4.17).

54 

 

It is not clear if the Gorringe northern thrust is connected to the Tagus Abyssal 

Plain fault (see Fig. 4.12) or if these structures are separated by lateral ramps, which 

could also be linked to the Marquês de Pombal - Horseshoe system (Fig. 4.18). This 

possibility is congruent with the conspicuous presence of WNW-ESE morphological 

scarps in this area (noticeably the same direction of the SWIM faults), suggesting that 

such lateral ramps exist, connecting the NE-SW thrusts. Also, a cluster of instrumental 

seismicity between the Horseshoe and the Marquês de Pombal faults and a few events 

between the north tips of the Horseshoe fault and the Gorringe northern thrust suggests 

the existence of such structures (see Figs. 4.17; see also Fig. 2.7). These lateral ramps 

may be accommodating the strike-slip component of WNW-ESE convergence between 

Nubia and Iberia in a scenario of strain partition as suggested by Terrinha et al. (2009, 

in appendix).  If this is the case, it bears major implications for the seismogenic 

potential of this area, and for the understanding of the margin reactivation process. 

Accordingly, further work needs to be made to test this hypothesis.

4.4. Other important tectonic structures 

 

 Besides the three previously described groups of structures, which included the 

Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge, the SWIM faults system and the SW Iberia NE-SW 

thrusts, other important structures were also recognized in study area, such as the ENE-

WSW to E-W striking system of thrusts and the NE-SW striking Cadiz fault (see Fig. 

4.2). The Seine thrusts and the Coral Patch thrust front that are predominantly 

northwestwards directed thrusts show a larger variation in fault strikes with respect to 

the ones located further north. These thrusts may also have a different geological 

history, related to the evolution of the Moroccan margin, which was not studied in 

detailed in this work. Nevertheless, they will be described below with some detail since 

they may be important for the understanding of the overall picture of the Gulf of Cadiz 

geotectonic evolution.  

 

 

4.4.1. The ENE-WSW to E-W thrust system 

 

 The ENE-WSW to E-W striking thrust system comprise the Coral Patch thrust 

front, the Seine thrusts and the Portimão pop-up (see Fig. 4.2; and also Figs. 4.17 and 

4.22 below). The Coral Patch thrust front and the Seine thrusts are a system of faults 

striking approximately ENE-WSW located off to the west of SW part of Gulf of Cadiz 

region (Fig. 4.19), extending from the southern Horseshoe Abyssal Plain (~36ºN) to the 

inner part of the Seine Abyssal Plain (~34ºN). This fault system consists of scattered to 

more or less continuous sub-parallel thrusts, often exhibiting a few hundred meters high 

linear scarps, with the exception of the Coral Patch Ridge and the Coral Patch Seamount 

that rise 1000 and 3500 meters, respectively, above the surrounding seafloor. The Coral 

Patch thrust front is interpreted as a low angle thrust that carries the Seine Abyssal Plain 

over the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain (Figs 4.20 and 4.21). The NE-SW striking Seine 

thrusts are isolated in the middle of the Seine Abyssal Plain with hanging-wall 

anticlines that correspond to linear hills with a maximum elevation of 800 meters above 

the seafloor. From the inspection of the seismic section shown in Figure 4.21 it is 

possible to observe that the Coral Patch thrust front and the Seine thrust form an active 



56 

 

thick-skinned North-vergent fold-and-thrust belt, offsetting the sedimentary cover 

around 1 second. The major thrusts root deep in the basement (at around 11 seconds), 

possible at the base of the oceanic crust, (or even deeper in the mantle). In addition, the 

presence of a blind thrust in the southern part of the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain (see Fig. 

4.19, detected in the northern segment of the MCS profile (see Fig.4.21), strongly 

suggests that these thrusts are propagating northwards, to an area where major 

instrumental earthquakes occur (see Figs. 1.4 and 4.17). This thrust system is likely to 

have originated as result of the Africa-Iberia convergence that started in the Upper 

Cretaceous. Despite de fact that some of these structures seem to be active, their activity 

has probably diminished since the Miocene as the result of the change to a more oblique 

convergence direction (WNW-ESE), as attested by the almost lack of seismicity on 

most of the thrusts (see Figs. 1.4 and 4.17).

(see Fig. 4.2). The AR-7 seismic profile track and bathymentric profile are coincident and shown in 

purple (see Figs. 4.22 and 4.21, respectively).

58 

 

The Portimão pop-up structure comprises two E-W antithetic thrusts bounding 

the Portimão Bank morphological high (Fig. 4.22). The E-W scarps are more prominent 

in the eastern part of the bank, where widespread landslide scars are observed, attesting 

for the activity of this structure (see Terrinha et al., 2009, in appendix). To the East the 

Portimão Bank is connected to the shelf by a relatively gentle slope. The southern thrust 

probably extends further east connecting with another thrust sub-parallel to the Cadiz 

fault (see Fig. 4.22 and text below). From the inspection of the seismic section 

presented in Fig. 4.23 it is possible to observe that the Portimão pop-up forms a slightly 

north-vergent anticline bounded by two thrusts that breach out through the seafloor, 

offsetting the cover sediments in more than 1 second. The southern thrust appears to 

have a wrenching component as attested by the presence of other minor faults, defining 

a flower-like structure (see Fig. 4.23). The Portimão pop-up also seems to have formed 

during the early Cenozoic in a phase of more North-directed convergence (see Terrinha 

et al., 2009, in appendix). Presently, this structure is probably accommodating some of 

the shortening component associated to the more oblique Nubia-Iberia convergence.

4.4.2. The Cadiz Fault 

 

The Cadiz fault strikes approximately NE-SW and extends for about 200 km 

from the northeastern Gulf of Cadiz continental shelf to the inner part of the 

accretionary wedge (Fig. 4.22: see also Figs. 4.2 and 4.4). The fault probably extends 

towards the NE into the Guadalquivir river basin, in the Betics foreland. The fault is 

slightly curved towards the west in its southern segment where it intersects the SWIM 2 

fault (see Fig. 4.22). Its seafloor morphology is complex (Fig. 4.24), defined by a 

relatively diffuse broad area with widths varying from several hundreds of meters to a 

few kilometers, materialized on the seafloor by the alignment of several different 

features such as crests, scarps, channels and diapiric ridges (see Figs. 4.22 and 4.24). 

The Cadiz fault morphological expression is more prominent in its northeastern segment 

and loses most of its expression progressively towards the South, vanishing in the 

surroundings of the SWIM 2 (see Figs. 4.2 and 4.22). However, several mud volcanoes 

are traceable southwards along the direction of the Cadiz fault suggesting that it may 

extend further south. The seismic section crossing the Cadiz fault (Fig. 4.25) shows that 

it is sub-parallel to a basement southeastwards-directed blind thrust, probably 



60 

 

contemporaneous of the Late Mesozoic - Early Cenozoic N-S convergence. The thrust 

movement is supported by the gentle folding of the reflectors of the basement. In the 

seismic profile is also possible to observe a thin-skinned fault accommodating the over-

thrusting of the accretionary wedge Miocene deformation front towards NE, over the 

basement. Near the surface the more continuous Pliocene-Quaternary cover sediments 

are clearly folded; though, they do not show evidences of major vertical faulting and 

displacement, attesting for wrenching movement of the Cadiz fault, discussed in Duarte 

et al. (2009, in appendix). No kinematic indicators could clearly be detected, probably 

due to the high rate of recent sedimentation associated with the proximal parts of the 

Mediterranean Outflow Water and as well as to the extrusion of fluidized material along 

mud volcanoes. The same authors, based on data published by Stich et al. (2006), which 

reported a 3.5 mm.a-1 of westward motion of the Gibraltar arc relative to intra-plate 

Iberia, proposed that the Cadiz lineament is a major dextral strike-slip fault zone 

accommodating the westward expulsion of the Gibraltar Arc relative to Iberia (see Fig. 

4.2). Also, a NE-SW elongated cluster of low to intermediate seismicity exists in this 

area attesting for the activity of this structure (see Fig. 4.17; and also Fig. 1.4).

Crescent-shaped morphotectonic 

features in the Gulf of Cadiz  
(offshore SW Iberia)

(This chapter is presented in a paper format, as published in Marine Geology; 

Duarte et al., 2010). 

 

The subject of this chapter is a group of intriguing kilometric crescent-shaped 

depressions lying in the Horseshoe Valley, between the GCAW and Horseshoe fault 

(see area in Fig. 4.2). A detailed morphotectonic analysis of the Horseshoe Valley 

contributed for the unraveling of the processes that originated these crescentic 

depressions. The present work showed that these features formed as the result of the 

interaction between downslope currents and tectonically-originated slope breaks. The 

crescentic depressions are controlled by active (blind) thrust faults that root at the 

GCAW décollement layer, to the west of the GCAW deformation front. Therefore, the 

crescentic depressions seem to correspond to the morphological expression of the 

westward propagation of the deformation from the realm of the accretionary wedge 

(GCAW), into the Horseshoe Valley domain.

Abstract 

 

Multibeam swath bathymetry data from the Northwestern part of the Gulf of 

Cadiz revealed the existence of several intriguing kilometric crescentic depressions 

lying between -4300 m and -4700 m, never before reported to occur at such great 

depths. Morphological parameterization of these features, coupled with detailed analysis 

of multi-channel and middle resolution seismic profiles, showed that these crescent-

shaped features were formed due to the existence of specific time-recurrent interaction 

between: a) regional active thrusts, which portray the overall tectonic scenario in the 

area, and on top of which most crescentic depressions are carved; and b)  tectonically 

induced scouring comprising localized erosion and simultaneous progradational 

sedimentation, produced by downslope currents of probable turbiditic origin. The 

obtained results also suggest a possible contribution of fluid migration and extrusion 

processes, such as mud volcanism and associated pockmark formation, besides gravity 

driven landslides and slumping, in the development of the studied crescentic 

depressions.

water sedimentary processes; deep sea scouring.

5.1. Introduction 

 

5.1.1. Previous work 

 

Crescent-shaped morphologies in association with escarpments are common in 

submarine and sub-aerial slope surfaces (e.g. sand dunes). They are frequently 

associated with gravitational mass transport (e.g. landslides and slumps), fluid escape 

and erosive processes. Landslides are typically bounded by arcuate, concave-downhill 

head scarps and concave uphill toes (Locat and Lee, 2000; McAdoo et al., 2000; Wilson 

et al., 2004; Martel, 2004). Features caused by collapse processes associated with fluid 

escape and mud volcanism can also exhibit crescent-shaped morphologies (Dimitrov 

and Woodside, 2003; Somoza et al., 2003; León et al., 2006), as in the case of 

asymmetrical pockmarks when occurring on slopes (Hovland and Judd, 1988). 

Submarine crescent-shaped morphologies related to erosional processes, such as 

scouring, are also documented in various geological settings, and usually associated 

with turbidity, downslope and bottom currents: Faugères et al. (1997) reported the 

existence of erosion scours in the termination of the Barbados Prism, at depths of about 

3000 m; Bulat and Long (2001) described a group of crescent-shaped scours in the 

Faroe-Shetland Channel with escarpments up to 200 m high, lying at depths of 200 m; 

Bonnel et al. (2005) described features in the Gulf of Lions formed by erosion-

deposition processes associated with turbidity currents; Verdichio and Trincardi (2006) 

reported a set of crescent-shaped features at depths of about 600 m with escarpments up 

to 50 m in the Southwest Adriactic Margin, formed by bottom currents; Fildani et al. 

(2006) recognized a group of crescent-shaped giant scours with escarpments up to 100 

m height at depths of about 3500 m near Monterey East Channel. 

In the North-eastern part of the Gulf of Cadiz, sub-circular seafloor features 

interpreted as asymmetrical pockmarks, slide scars and erosion scours, associated with 

mud volcanism, hydrocarbon seepage, mass wasting processes and bottom currents 

activity have also been described (e.g. Somoza et al., 2003; Léon et al., 2006; 

Hernández-Molina et al., 2006; Mulder et al., 2006;  Hanquiez et al., 2007). However, 

unlike the ones discussed in this work, most of these features are located at relatively 

shallow depths, ranging from the outer continental shelf to the middle continental slope. 



66 

 

In the present paper we report the existence of submarine kilometric crescentic 

depressions at depths of more than 4000 m (between -4300 m and -4700 m). Based on 

recently acquired multibeam swath bathymetry data (Zitellini et al., 2009; Terrinha et 

al., 2009), coupled with the analysis of available multi-channel seismics (MCS) and 

middle resolution seismic profiles, we supply a detailed morphological description of 

these features, their internal sedimentary structure and their structural setting and 

discuss different processes that could have led to their formation.  

 

 

5.1.2. General tectonic setting and geomorphology 

 

The Gulf of Cadiz is located in the Atlantic Ocean offshore SW Iberia and NW 

Morocco (Fig. 5.1A and inset), comprising the easternmost segment of the Azores-

Gibraltar Fracture Zone, which is interpreted as the Atlantic Africa-Eurasia main plate 

boundary (e.g. Purdy, 1975; Zitellini et al., 2009). The most important tectonic features 

presently observed in the Gulf of Cadiz (Fig. 5.1B) result from the Early Cenozoic to 

Late Miocene Alpine orogenesis overprinted onto preexistent extensional basins of 

Triassic-Cretaceous age (Terrinha, 1998). This evolution is associated with the collision 

between Iberia and northwest Africa (Nubia) tectonic plates, which ultimately led to the 

formation of the Betic-Rif orogenic arc in Miocene times and the submarine 

accretionary wedge of the Gulf of Cadiz (e.g. Srivastava et al., 1990; Lonergan and 

White, 1997; Maldonado et al., 1999; Rosenbaum et al., 2002a,b, Gutscher et al., 2002; 

Iribarren et al., 2007).  Late Miocene to present tectonics is mainly determined by: a) 

oblique convergence between Nubia and Eurasia (Iberia) plates (Calais et al., 2003); and 

b) Eastward dipping subduction of an oceanic slab with development of the Gulf of 

Cadiz accretionary prism (Gutscher et al., 2002).  

The overall morphological shaping of the Gulf of Cadiz results from the 

interaction between regional active tectonics, sedimentation and erosional processes, 

fluid migration and escape and oceanographic dynamics (Gutscher et al., 2002; 

Gutscher et al., 2009; Pinheiro et al., 2003; Somoza et al., 2003; Hernández-Molina et 

al., 2006; Terrinha et al., 2009). The form and geographic location of this region, 



67 

 

enclosing in its easternmost domain the gateway to the Mediterranean Sea across the 

Straits of Gibraltar (Fig. 5.1), locally determines the behaviour of various major water 

masses, such as the North Atlantic Deep Water and particularly the Mediterranean 

Outflow Water - MOW (e.g. Ambar and Howe, 1979a,b; Llave et al., 2001; Johnson et 

al., 2002; Llave et al., 2006; Mulder et al., 2006; Hernández-Molina et al., 2006, 2008). 

A more detailed characterization of the Gulf of Cadiz allowed the recognition of the 

several main geomorphologic features depicted in Fig. 5.1A. The kilometric crescentic 

depressions targeted in this work are located in the so called Horseshoe Valley, offshore 

the SW Iberian margin (see Fig. 5.1A, 5.2, 5.3). This area displays a network of well 

developed submarine, canyons, gulleys and wide valleys, which are related to the 

channelling of downslope and turbidity currents, driving the sediments from the 

continental shelf and slope to the abyssal plain (Fig. 5.2B). Here, the impact of 

downslope processes on the shaping of the seafloor is clearly dominant. Moreover, this 

area is subjected to tectonic uplift (Terrinha et al., 2003, Gràcia et al., 2003), related to 

general north-westward thrusting in the Gulf of Cadiz, which favours erosion by valley 

inception as a response to higher slope and more abrupt morphology building (Zitellini 

et al., 2004, Terrinha et al., 2009).

5.2. Methodology and data 

 

The discovery of the seafloor crescentic depressions described in this paper 

resulted from the analysis of two main sets of data: multibeam swath bathymetry and 

seismic reflection. The bathymetry data were used to characterize the geomorphology of 

the area where the crescentic depressions are situated and also to accomplish a detailed 

morphological parameterization of these features. The seismic reflection dataset 

comprises multi-channel and middle resolution seismics. The multi-channel seismics 

were used to unravel the general deep structure of the area where the crescentic 

depressions are located, whereas the analysis of higher resolution profiles aimed at a 

detailed characterization of the shallow structure and sedimentary architecture of these 

features.  

 

5.2.1. Multibeam swath bathymetry data 

 

The multibeam swath bathymetry dataset was acquired during the MATESPRO 

(Major TEctonic and Sedimentary PROcesses in the Portuguese Margins – see Figs. 5.2, 

5.4) cruise, onboard the Portuguese vessel NRP D. Carlos I in June/July 2004 (Terrinha 

et al., 2009). The cruise covered a total area of approximately 38 000 km
2
 in the 

northwestern part of the Gulf of Cadiz region. The bathymetric data were acquired using 

a hull-mounted Simrad EM120 multibeam echosounder, fulfilling the rules established 

by the International Hydrographic Organization for an order 3 hydrographic survey (see 

Terrinha et al., 2009). Interpretation was made using terrain analysis techniques and 

image analysis of the bathymetry using commercial software, ArcGIS and Fledermaus. 

 

 

 

 



71 

 

5.2.2. Seismic reflection data 

 

Multi-channel seismic profiles of the Iberian Atlantic Margin campaign (Banda 

et al., 1995; Tortella et al., 1997) were used for the inspection of the deep structure. 

Two single-channel seismic profiles were acquired (PSAT-244 and 246) during the 14
th

 

Training-Through-Research cruise of UNESCO –IOC, Leg 1, onboard of the Russian 

vessel RV Professor Logachev in July/August 2004 (Fig. 5.3; Kenyon et al., 2006), in 

the scope of the MVSEIS Euromargins Project. The MCS has a vertical resolution 

between 20 and 50 m and the single channel have a vertical resolution of about 2 to 5 m. 

 

 

5.3. Morphotectonic characterization of the 

crescentic depressions 

 

5.3.1. Morphotectonic setting: the Horseshoe Valley 

  

The Horseshoe Valley, together with the S. Vincent canyon, is one of the two 

collectors of the shelf and slope erosive system of southwest Iberia that converge into 

the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain. The studied crescentic depressions are located in the 

Horseshoe Valley (HV) (Figs. 5.2, 5.3) that collects the Aljezur, Portimão, Lagos and 

Faro Canyons, the Portimão and the Cadiz Valley. The HV has a trapezoidal shape with 

depths varying between -4200 m to -4800 m and a mean slope of 0.5º to the west.  

The HV is delimited by the Sagres Plateau in the North, by the Coral Patch 

Ridge in the South, and by the deformation front of the Gulf of Cadiz accretionary 

wedge in the East (Figs. 5.2A, C, 5.3). To the West, the HV is bounded by the NE-SW 

trending Horseshoe Fault, which corresponds to a westward directed active thrust 

(Gràcia et al., 2003, Zitellini et al., 2004), whose morphologic expression is marked by 

a hundred meter high scarp separating this domain from the westward adjacent 

Horseshoe Abyssal Plain (see Figs. 5.1B, 5.2C). The drainage system finds its way 



72 

 

across the Horseshoe Fault scarp along narrows gullies that are the loci of retreating 

erosion showing evidences of landslide occurrence (Fig. 5.2).

slumps and landslides. (B) Line drawing depicting the interpretation of the main morphotectonic features 

observed and the numbering of the study crescentic depressions. 



73 

 

The flat area of the Horseshoe Valley is thus interpreted as being uplifted on the 

hanging wall of the deep seated Horseshoe Fault (e.g. Tortella et al., 1997; Zitellini et 

al., 2004; Terrinha et al., 2009). This area is also affected by several major WNW-ESE 

trending lineaments, the SWIM lineaments (Figs. 5.1B, 5.3B), which were recently 

interpreted as aligned arrays of also deep seated, sub-vertical, dextral strike-slip faults 

(Terrinha et al., 2009; Rosas et al., 2009; Zitellini et al., 2009). The transitional area 

from the Sagres Valley to the Horseshoe Valley displays an undulated seafloor surface 

comprising waves varying from hundreds of meters to more than 10 km in length, and 

up to 5 km across (white arrows in Fig. 5.3). These features are generally straight to 

slightly sinuous, and their undulated surfaces have also been previously interpreted as 

the bathymetric expression of mass transport processes and soft sediment deformation, 

including gravity driven folds, small scale slumps and turbiditic erosional/deposition 

features (Terrinha et al., 2009).  

Despite the shallow dip of the Horseshoe Valley, a thorough analysis of its 

bathymetry allowed the identification of slope breaks, separating a staircase-like series 

of flats, descending in the direction of the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain (Fig. 5.3). Some of 

these scarps correspond to NE-SW trending folds sitting on top of westwards directed 

blind thrusts as described elsewhere in this work. The crescentic depressions reported in 

this work are located on these slope breaks (Figs. 5.3, 5.4).

seafloor and the abruptness of the crescentic escarpments; (D) Parallel bathymetric profile X‘-Y‘ that 

does not cut across the crescentic depressions, depicting the existence of smoother slope breaks in the 

Horseshoe Valley seafloor (yellow arrows). 

 

5.3.2. Geometry of the Horseshoe Valley crescentic depressions 

 

The study objects of this work are the crescentic depressions that are located 

strictly within the HV only. This is because, firstly, they bear no obvious association 

with gravity or mass transport processes as others in the Gulf of Cadiz, like the ones 

located further north on the slope of the Sagres plateau (see Fig. 5.3), secondly, they 

cluster within the shallow dipping channel (HV mean dip is 0.5º and the maximum local 

dip is 3º) that collects the drainage system already mentioned, thirdly, they are located 

between two main tectonic structures, the Horseshoe Fault and the accretionary wedge 



75 

 

and, fourthly, they are probably the deepest crescent shapes described in the scientific 

literature, between -4300m and -4700m.  

The crescentic depressions exhibit a morphology consisting of downslope 

concave crescent-shaped escarpments surrounding an internal depression with 

kilometric lengths (Figs. 5.4, 5.5A). Morphological parameters were used to describe 

eight crescentic depressions in the HV, as depicted in Fig. 5.5B and in Table 5.1. 

 

 

5.3.2.1. Height and slope of the crescentic depression scarps 

 

The height and slope of the crescent-shaped escarpments can be seen as 

expressing the degree of abruptness (or steepness) of these features. The measured data 

(Table 5.1) show a mean slope value of approximately 0.2 (~11º dip), with the 

exception of crescentic depression 5 in which the escarpment exhibits a higher slope of 

0.51 (~27º dip). The escarpment heights vary mostly between 80 m and 120 m, with the 

exceptions of depressions 1 and 2, which show heights of 50 m and 30 m respectively. 

Based on these data (slope and height) no consistent relationship can be drawn between 

the variation of the abruptness of the individual crescentic depressions and their location 

in the HV.  In fact, the data shows that some constancy exists in the steepness of the 

escarpment crescents regardless of their different locations, shapes and sizes. The 

roughly linear relationship between height and width suggests that the steepness might 

depend on material properties, such as cohesion or plastic yield point, for the cases of 

loose materials like sand or clays, respectively.

5.3.2.2. Crescentic depression axial ratio - a 

 

The internal depressions of the studied features exhibit widths and lengths 

(parameters CW and CL as defined in Figs. 5.5A – inset, and B)  that vary from 500 m 

to 2500 m, and between 750 and 5000 m, respectively (Table 5.1). The axial ratio of the 

crescentic depressions is here defined as: 

 

  
    

  
 

 

Parameter a equals 1 when the general overall shape of the depression 

approximates a semi-circumference. If depressions show semi-elliptical shapes, a is 

either &gt;1, when CL/2&gt; CW as is generally the case, or a&amp;lt;1, when CL/2&lt;CW. 

Similarly to what was referred above for height and slope, no coherent/linear 

relationship exists between a and the individual location of the crescentic depressions in 

the Horseshoe Valley. Moreover, it is also clear from the graphic in Fig. 5.5D that with 

the exception of feature 2, all samples plot at values of a?1, meaning that crescentic 

depressions tend to develop similar shapes in spite of their different locations. 

In Fig. 5.5E, the relationship between the slope and the axial ratio is graphically 

illustrated. Because the slope values are constant (between ~0.1 and ~0.25, see Fig. 

5.5C), all samples but feature 5 cluster under constant slope of ~0.25 and it is clear that 

the crescentic depressions cluster in three groups as a function of their different values 

of a. The first group (Group 1 in Fig. 5.5E) consists of feature 2 only, which exhibits a 

singular low a value, implying an extreme concavity, and a highly elongated geometry 

parallel to the direction of its longest CW axis (see Figs. 5.3B, 5.4, 5.5A). Group 2 

includes 5 of the 8 crescentic depressions with a values comprised between 1.0 and 1.5 

(mean a value of ~1.23). Finally, the third group comprises crescentic depressions 4 and 

7 with relatively high a values of 2.5, implying highly elongated semi-elliptical shapes. 

 



78 

 

It should be noted that with the exception of crescentic depressions 2 and 5, 

which show anomalous values of axial ratio and slope, all the crescentic escarpments 

are oriented parallel to the direction of the large scale slope breaks that disrupt the 

Horseshoe Valley seafloor (see Figs. 5.3, 5.4).

5.3.3. Sedimentary and tectonic structure of the crescentic 

depressions 

 

The description of the detailed structural architecture of the crescentic 

depressions was based on the interpretation of multi-channel (IAM4e, Fig. 5.6) and 

middle resolution seismic profiles (PSAT246 and PSAT 244, Figs. 5.7, 5.8). 

 

5.3.3.1. Multi-channel seismic profile IAM4e 

 

The IAM4e profile strikes NW-SE along the Horseshoe Valley intersecting 

crescentic depressions 2 and 4 and passing close to number 3 (see Fig. 5.6; 5.3 for the 

location of the profile). It comprises the following seismostratigraphic units and sub-

units: 



79 

 

a) A basal unit (A) of coherent high amplitude, continuous and parallel 

reflections, with a thickness of about 2 s (twt), corresponding to Mesozoic through 

Eocene rocks (Tortella et al., 1997). This unit is cut by several reverse faults that also 

affect the overlying units, but do not breach out at the seafloor surface. The exception to 

this is the Horseshoe Fault, which cuts through all the cover units offsetting them by 

approximately 1 s (twt). 

b) Unit B is approximately ~1.5 s (twt) thick, has a semi-chaotic seismic 

signature, characterized by high amplitude shallow dipping discontinuous seismic 

reflections with continuous eastwards dipping reflections. The latter can be 

continuously followed for more than 10km and have been interpreted by various authors 

as thrust imbricate of middle Miocene age, and olistostromes deposits (Torelli et al., 

1997; Tortella et al., 1997), that detach at the sole of Unit B (Fig. 5.6). Some of these 

thrusts were reactivated as blind thrusts in Pliocene-Quaternary times because they 

deform the sediments of this age that are included in Unit C. The deformation caused by 

the blind thrusts is accommodated by the top Unit C by folds that account for the 

stepped morphology of the HV. The majority of the crescentic depressions are located 

along these folds, carved in their slope breaks that disrupt the Horseshoe Valley seafloor 

(see Fig. 5.3, 5.4, 5.6).  

c) A top Unit C of ~ 0.5 s (twt) of thickness, generally characterized by very 

well imaged parallel reflections, corresponding to a hemi-pelagic sedimentary cover that 

accordingly with Tortella et al. (1997) comprises two seismostratigraphic sub-units of 

different age (SU1 and SU2 in Fig. 5.6): 

- A Late Miocene sub-unit (SU1) that exhibits a thickness varying between 0.1 s 

to 0.3 s (twt), consisting of high amplitude, high frequency, coherent reflections 

with onlap and downlap terminations on top of a folded and faulted basal 

discontinuity, which separates SU1 from the underlying lower to middle 

Miocene unit; 

- A Pliocene-Quaternary sub-unit (SU2) with a fairly constant thickness of about 

0.2 s (twt), consisting of a sequence of high amplitude reflections, although less 

coherent than those of SU1, showing a parallel to prograding geometry, with 

downlap and onlap terminations.

crescentic depressions 2 and 4 are located on top of blindthrusts rooted in the sole of the chaotic body. 

SU1 and SU2 – Late Miocene to Plio-Quaternary sub-units.  

 

In the IAM4e profile a dome-like structure at the top of Unit B can be seen 

around shot point 460 (Fig. 5.6). This dome is seemingly impinging the uppermost 

cover unit, reaching the seafloor surface and producing a bathymetric ellipsoidal ridge 

in the vicinity of crescentic depression 3, clearly seen in the bathymetry (see Figs. 5.3, 

5.4). This dome shows a WNW-ESE elongation and a maximum high of 100 m. 

Crescentic depressions 2 and 4 incise the subunit SU2 as imaged at shot points 

587 and 340 in the IAM4e profile (Fig. 5.6). These crescentic depressions are located on 

top of hanging wall anticlines of upward propagating blind thrusts that are well 



81 

 

recognized in Unit B. Despite the low resolution of this multi-channel seismic reflection 

profile it is clear that the escarpment of depression 4 corresponds to an erosional 

surface, since it truncates the uppermost seismic horizons. An upward convex geometry 

of the internal part of the depression is also detectable at this resolution and is imaged at 

a higher resolution in Fig. 5.7. 

 

 

5.3.3.2. Middle resolution seismic profiles (PSAT-246 and PSAT-

244) 

 

The detailed structure of the crescentic depression could only be 

comprehensively addressed through the examination of the higher resolution seismic 

profiles PSAT-246 and PSAT-244 specifically acquired for this purpose. The 

attenuation of acoustic energy by the water column of 4 km and sediments did not allow 

imaging below stratigraphic Unit C, to a maximum of circa 0.5 s (twt). The base of Unit 

C was cross checked with IAM4e seismic profile. 

The WNW-ESE oriented PSAT-246 profile cuts across crescentic depressions 3 

and 7 (Fig. 5.7, 5.3 for location). In its eastern part, between the Accretionary Wedge 

Deformation Front (AWDF) and depression 7, the lower SU1 sub-unit shows a 

succession of coherent reflectors with parallel, gently folded configuration (Fig. 5.7). 

The continuation of this unit to the West of depression 7 is not clear, and it was only 

interpretatively assumed by correlation with the slightly oblique (NW-SE) IAM4e 

profile (see Fig. 5.3). The sub-unit SU2 is recognizable along the whole of the WNW-

ESE profile length. Between the AWDF and crescentic depression 7, the reflectors in 

this sub-unit also exhibit a slightly folded configuration, but this is attenuated towards 

the surface, where the reflections are almost horizontal (Fig. 5.7). Close to crescentic 

depressions 7 and 3, to the West of each of their escarpments, sub-unit SU2 consists of 

several individual uphill progradation bodies. This, together with the truncation of sub-

unit SU2 horizons behind the crescent-shaped scarps suggests uphill progradation of the 

sedimentary infill simultaneous with escarpment retreat (Fig. 5.7B). In the internal part 

of depression 3 several progadation bodies are buried (SU2a, SU2b and SU2c - Fig. 



82 

 

5.7C), separated by planar discontinuities (d2, d3 and d4, respectively) matching erosive 

truncations, against which the reflectors often exhibit onlap and downlap terminations.

SU2a-d – Progradational bodies (lobes); d1-4 –Stratigraphic discontinuities. 

 

 



83 

 

The NE-SW oriented PSAT-244 profile intersects the internal part of crescentic 

depression 3, thus providing a strike-section of the prograding internal bodies and 

sections across the tip points of the depressions scarp (Figs. 5.3, 5.8). It is also possible 

to observe the dome-like structure (shot points 1026 in PSAT-244 and 460 in IAM4e, 

Figs. 5.6, 5.8, respectively) underlain by a seismically transparent zone, the origin of 

which is unknown. Considering the widespread existence of mud volcanoes and salt 

diapirs with morphological expression on the seafloor in the Gulf of Cadiz, it is 

hypothesized that this dome could correspond to a fluid escape structure as well.

84 

 

5.4. Discussion 

 

The morphologic parameters of the studied crescentic depressions determined 

above (section 5.3.2), specifically slope and axial ratio (a), show that both their general 

shape and the steepness of their escarpments are independent of their location along the 

westwards smoothly dipping Horseshoe Valley, whose general morphology is most 

probably essentially related with the collection and transport of sediments from the 

shallower northern and northeastern domains of the Gulf of Cadiz (continental shelf and 

slope, see Figs. 5.1A, 5.2B). This suggests a similar fundamental origin for these 

features, associated with natural processes other than only, or predominantly, the 

varying smooth slope of the Horseshoe Valley as a whole. 

 

 

5.4.1. Active tectonics 

 

The studied features consist of crescent-shaped erosional depressions carved in 

seafloor slope breaks (see Fig. 5.3, 5.4) that correspond to the morphologic expression 

of blind thrusts, as shown in Fig. 5.6. The interpretation of the middle resolution seismic 

profiles (Fig. 5.7) also showed that the sedimentary units deposited within the crescentic 

depressions, and the external ones eroded by the retreating scarp (SU2 in Fig. 5.7C), are 

of the same age at the considered timescale. This scenario is compellingly indicative of 

the control exerted by present day active thrusting in the formation and localization of 

the crescentic depressions. 

 

 

 

 



85 

 

5.4.2. Hypothetic hydrodynamic models 

  

 In the present situation, hydrodynamic models can only be discussed 

hypothetically, given the fact that the detailed deep?water circulation in the Gulf of 

Cadiz, and particular in the Horseshoe Valley, is still fundamentally unknown. The 

progradational architecture of the sedimentary lobes (section 5.3.3.2) is indicative of 

upslope deposition towards the internal part of the crescentic depressions, coeval with 

upslope erosion of their scarps. This requires the existence of deep water currents, 

which would be responsible for simultaneous localized erosion and sedimentation. Such 

specific dynamics of interaction between a flow current and a pre-existent morphology 

has previously been described worldwide by several authors, although at shallower 

depths (Stow et al., 2002a,b; Verdicchio and Trincardi, 2006; Bulat and Long, 2001; 

Fildani et al., 2006; Normark et al., 2009). 

 

 

5.4.2.1. Bottom currents  

 

In this case, the observed erosional scarps and upslope progradational bodies 

could hypothetically be both generated by the lateral movement of a bottom current, 

such as the North Atlantic Deep Water, parallel to the tectonically originated slope 

breaks. However, this interaction would preferably cause the formation of more linear 

erosive and depositional features, similarly to mounded, elongated and separated drifts 

(Faugères et al., 1999; Rebesco and Stow, 2001; Gràcia et al., 2009), rather than 

confined crescentic depressions. 

Alternatively, the crescentic depressions could also be generated by the action of 

vertical eddies associated to this same type of current, at least by two different 

mechanisms (e.g. Hernández-Molina et al., 2008): i) the influence of energetic Meddies 

in the base of the Mediterranean Outflow Water, which could propagate to the seafloor; 

and ii) due to the local interaction of different water masses with similar densities. 

Accordingly, vertical eddy movement could generate erosional/depositional seafloor 

features, characterized by less linear, i.e. more equidimensional, morphologies 



86 

 

(Hernández-Molina et al., 2008). An objection to this, is the fact that even the more 

equidimensional features generated by vertical eddies would probably tend to display a 

random localization in the HV and have a sub-circular (or semi-circular) geometry, 

rather than corresponding to sets of crescentic depressions with scarps systematically 

orientated downslope located on morphologic steps of the seafloor, as observed in the 

present case. In addition, this mechanism also does not provide a clear explanation for 

the formation of the observed upslope sedimentary bodies. 

Another possibility corresponds to admit that the crescentic scarps could 

represent the scars of major landslides triggered by tectonic events, which would later 

be reworked and filled in with sediments by the action of bottom currents, in a similar 

manner to the formation of the ?infill drifts? (Rebesco and Stow, 2001).  

 

 

5.4.2.2. Turbidity currents  

 

The existence of erosive crescentic scarps consistently oriented downslope along 

the Horseshoe Valley main drainage axis (see Fig. 5.2B), strongly suggests the 

contribution of downslope turbity currents to the formation of these features. Such 

currents have previously been reported to interact with seafloor localized morphologies 

causing simultaneous erosion (scouring) and (re)deposition (Fildani et al., 2006; 

Alexander, 2008; Lamb et al., 2008; Heinio and Davies, 2009; Normark et al., 2009).  

In the Monterey East system Fildani et al. (2006) studied several features that 

originated in a field of sandwaves, geometrically similar to the ones described here. 

Following previous theoretical (Parker and Izumi, 2000; Sun and Parker, 2005) and 

laboratory (Koyama and Ikeda, 1998; Taki and Parker, 2005) work, the cited authors 

modelled the formation of linear sets of crescentic giant scours based on the idea of 

cyclic steps. The formation of cyclic steps (Fig. 5.9A) is determined by the occurrence 

of hydraulic jumps (Fig. 5.9B), in which a flow makes a rapid change from thin, rapid 

supercritical flow (Froude number&gt;1) to thick, tranquil sub-critical flow (Froude  

number&lt;1, Fildani et al., 2006; Normark et al., 2009). According to these ideas, in the 

Horseshoe Valley, the flow of an overriding turbidity current could be forced to 



87 

 

accelerate to supercritical velocities (i.e. with a Froude number&gt;1) as a consequence of 

straightening caused by the seafloor uplift on the hanging wall of the blind thrusts 

underlying the studied crescentic depressions (see Fig. 5.9). When passing one of these 

obstacles the flow would be abruptly slowed, increasing in height and dissipating some 

of its own kinematic energy through turbulence (hydraulic jump; see Fig. 5.9B). 

Upstream of the hydraulic jump the occurrence of high bed shear stress would locally 

favour erosion, while downstream of the jump, very rapid deposition would be favoured 

(see Fig. 5.9B). These two areas would move in tandem upstream, forcing the hydraulic 

jump in the same direction (see Fig. 5.9A, Fildani et al., 2006; Alexander, 2008; Lamb 

et al., 2008; Heinio and Davies, 2009; Normark et al., 2009). 

It should be noted that unlike the features studied by Fildani et al. (2006), the 

crescentic depressions described in the present paper are not aligned in one single linear 

train, but rather scattered along a broad area (see Fig. 5.3). These different spatial 

configurations are probably due to the broad and curved geometry of the thalweg in the 

upper part of the Horseshoe Valley (see Fig. 5.2B), which forces the flow to spread and 

sub-divide. On the other hand, some degree of lateral alignment (Fig. 5.3B) concurs 

with the tectonic control determined by the existent underlying blind thrusts (see above 

section 5.4.1.).

5.4.3. Interplay between active tectonics and turbidity currents 

 

The above discussion of the possible hydrodynamic models, shows that the 

contribution of bottom currents for the formation of the study crescentic features should 

not be discarded, namely in view of previously reported interpretations for similar 

features in somewhat different contexts (e.g. Bulat and Long, 2001; Stow et al., 

2002a,b; Verdicchio and Trincardi, 2006; Hernández-Molina et al., 2008). However, in 



89 

 

the present case, the observed crescentic shape of the studied depressions, as well as 

their particular architecture resulting from simultaneous erosion and deposition, are still 

difficult to explain exclusively as the result of these processes. Because of this, the 

contribution of downslope turbidity currents should also be considered, and in the face 

of the presently available dataset, the formation and upstream migration of a 

tectonically controlled hydraulic jump seemingly provides a simpler explanation for the 

particular crescentic shape of the observed erosional scarps and associated upslope 

sedimentary bodies. In accordance, the following events must be considered to explain 

the origin of the crescentic depressions (Fig. 5.10): 

a) Active blind thrusting was responsible for the formation of several 

morphological steps in the smooth seafloor of the Horseshoe Valley (Fig. 5.10A-B). 

b) These abrupt linear slope breaks can originate gravity instabilities that exhibit 

crescent-shaped scarps. These scarps localize the downslope turbidity currents (Fig. 

5.10B, inset), triggering the formation of a hydraulic jump, inducing scouring upstream 

of the jump and simultaneous prograding sedimentation of the eroded material 

downstream (Fig. 5.10B-C). 

c) The fact that some of the progradational sedimentary lobes are buried and 

incised by shallower ones, strongly suggests a tectonic reactivation of the main blind 

thrusts, thus resetting the whole process, steepening the eroded retreated escarpments, or 

forming new ones, retriggering scouring and prograding sedimentation (Fig. 5.10D-E).

5.4.4. The possible role of fluid escape processes 

 

Besides tectonics and scouring associated with the downslope currents, the 

middle resolution seismic data also reveals the possible importance of fluid escape 

processes, in the formation of the crescentic depressions as discussed elsewhere in the 

text and shown in Figs. 5.6, 5.8 and in the bathymetry (see Figs. 5.3, 5.4). The 

assumption that the dome localized close to crescentic depression 3 can be related to 

fluid escape processes is based not only on the transparent character of a shallow 

stratigraphic unit, but also by the fact that in the Gulf of Cadiz, particularly in the 

shallow sediments of the accretionary wedge domain, several tectonically controlled 

mud volcanoes and pockmarks of similar dimensions (Fig. 5.1A) have also been 

reported by other authors (e.g. Pinheiro et al., 2003; Somoza et al., 2003). These are 

described to be associated with widespread occurrence of fluid flow, and more recently 

were also reported to exist at greater depths, close to the Accretionary Wedge 

Deformation Front (e.g. Hensen et al., 2007). Moreover, some asymmetrical pockmarks 

also exhibit ground collapse geometries remarkably similar to the presently studied 

crescentic depressions (Schroot et al., 2003; Somoza et al., 2003; Dimitrov et al., 2003). 

However, because there is only one of these structures nearby one of the studied 

features, this mechanism alone could not account for the generalized origin of these 

features, and should preferably be seen as one possible contribution amid the dominant 

cause related to the tectonic/turbidity currents interplay.

(This chapter is presented in a paper format, as submitted to Marine Geology.) 

 

The SWIM faults seem to be active dextral strike-slip lithospheric faults. The 

subduction-related GCAW, which is crosscut by the SWIM faults, is also considered 

active. If this is the case then some kind of tectonic interference patterns between these 

structures should be expected to occur. Conversely, if one of these structures is not 

presently active then some cross-cutting relationships should be apparent in the 

available dataset, and it is not. Moreover, both the SWIM system and the GCAW appear 

to be associated with different tectonic driving mechanisms: the SWIM faults are 

associated to the Nubia-Iberia convergence and the GCAW is related to the Gibraltar 

Arc retreating subduction. Thus, the interplay in space and time between these major 

structures can provide fruitful insights on how those driving mechanisms operated in 

past, as well as on the recent geodynamic evolution of the Gulf of Cadiz. With this 

objective, three different modes of tectonic interference between an accretionary wedge 

and strike-slip faults were tested using analog sand-box modeling. Another paper (Rosas 

et al., submitted), concerning the tectonic interference between the SWIM 1 strike-slip 

fault and the Horseshoe fault (part of the NE-SW Thrust System), is also presented in 

appendix.

Abstract 

  

 In the Gulf of Cadiz, a segment of the Africa-Iberia plate boundary in the North-

East Atlantic ocean, three main different modes of tectonic interference between a 

recently identified wrench system (SWIM) and the Gulf of Cadiz accretionary wedge 

(GCAW) were tested through analog sand-box modeling: a) An active accretionary 

wedge on top of a pre-existent inactive basement fault; b) An active strike-slip fault 

cutting a previously formed, inactive, accretionary wedge; and c) Simultaneous activity 

of both the accretionary wedge and the strike-slip fault. The results we obtained and the 

comparison with the natural deformation pattern favor a tectonic evolution comprising 

two main steps: i) the formation of the Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge on top of 

inactive, Tethyan-related, basement faults (Middle Miocene to ~1.8 Ma); ii) subsequent 

reactivation of these basement faults with dextral strike-slip motion (~1.8 Ma to 

Present) simultaneously with continued tectonic accretion in the GCAW. These results 

exclude the possibility of ongoing active SWIM wrench system cross-cutting an 

inactive GCAW structure. Our results also support a new interpretation of the SWIM 

wrench system as fundamentally resulting from strike-slip reactivation of an old 

(Tethyan-related) plate boundary.

6.1. Introduction 

 

The Gulf of Cadiz is situated in the North-East Atlantic Ocean, west of the 

Gibraltar Straights, offshore SW Iberia and NW Morocco (Fig. 6.1). This zone marks 

the transition between the Mediterranean Alpine Collision Belt and the Atlantic Azores 

– Gibraltar Fracture Zone (AGFZ; see Fig. 6.1) and corresponds to a segment of the 

Africa-Eurasia plate boundary previously described as tectonically diffuse (e.g. Sartori 

et al., 1994; Medialdea et al., 2004). Accordingly, a variety of tectonic structures with 

different orientations, corresponding mostly to W-NW directed thrusts and WNW-ESE 

dextral strike-slip faults (Fig. 6.1B), are thought to accommodate a WNW-ESE Present 

day convergence between Eurasia (Iberia sub-plate) and Africa (Nubia sub-plate) at a 

rate of ca. 4-5 mm/yr (Argus et al., 1989; DeMets et al., 1994; Sella et al., 2002; Calais 

et al., 2003; Fernandes et al., 2003; Fernandes, 2004; Nocquet and Calais, 2004; 

Fernandes et al., 2007). 

 The seismicity of this domain has been characterized as moderate, although 

several high magnitude historical and instrumental earthquakes are known (e.g.  Ms=7.9 

28/02/1969 and and Mw=6.0,12/02/2007 earthquakes, respectively; Fukao, 1973 and 

Stich et al., 2006, 2007). Among these, the 1755 Great Lisbon Earthquake (estimated 

magnitude of 8.5 to 8.7; Abe et al, 1979; Johnston, 1996; Martinez-Solares and Arroyo, 

2004) that triggered a devastating tsunami and destroyed the Portuguese capital 

(Baptista et al., 1998; Zitellini et al., 2001; Martinez-Solares and Arroyo, 2004). Despite 

recent mapping updates of the main tectonic structures of this region based on the 

interpretation of a great variety of newly acquired data (e.g. multi-beam swath 

bathymetry, reflection and refraction seismics, geodetic; Johnston, 1996, Gonzalez et 

al., 1996; Zitellini et al., 2001; Gutscher et al., 2002, 2009a,b; Baptista et al., 2003; 

Gracia et al., 2003a,b; Mulder et al., 2003; Zitellini et al., 2004; Rosas et al., 2009; 

Terrinha et al., 2009; Zitellini et al., 2009), the precise location of the 

seismogenic/tsunamigenic source of 1755 major event is still the subject of ongoing 

debate (e.g. Baptista et al., 1998; Buforn et al., 1988; Zitellini et al., 2001; Gracia et al., 

2003a,b; Terrinha et al., 2003; Gutscher, 2004; Gutscher et al., 2006; Terrinha et al., 

2009).

In the tectonic map of Fig. 6.1B three main sets of structures are promptly 

recognized: a) several NE-SW striking, westwards directed thrust faults (e.g. Gorringe, 

Horseshoe and Marquês de Pombal faults); b) major WNW-ESE striking dextral strike-

slip faults (the SWIM faults) and c) a major thrust bounding the so called Gulf of Cadiz 

Accretionary Wedge (GCAW frontal thrust). Structures of the first set have previously 

been described as active and, individually (e.g Gorringe fault), or together (Marques de 

Pombal and Horseshoe faults), successively considered and dismissed as possible 

seismogenic/tsunamigenic sources of the 1755 Great Lisbon Earhquake (e.g. Baptista et 

al., 1998; Buforn et al., 1988; Zitellini et al., 2001; Terrinha et al., 2009). The other two 

sets of tectonic structures support the following two fundamental ideas for the 

interpretation of the Gulf of Cadiz tectonic framework (Gutscher et al., 2002; Zitellini et 

al., 2009): 

 

- Gutscher et al. (2002), building on previously reported similar ideas (e.g. 

Royden, 1993 and Lonergan and White, 1997), consider the tectonic evolution 

of this plate boundary as being dominated by active (roll back) subduction of a 

retreating east-dipping lithospheric slab, presently positioned beneath the 

Gibraltar Arc (Fig. 6.1B). Accordingly, associated synthetic accretion of 

sediments is also reported to occur, represented by the Gulf of Cadiz 

Accretionary Wedge (GCAW, Fig. 6.1B), in which several imbricated west-

directed active thrusts accommodate on-going shortening. 

 

- Zitellini et al. (2009) argue for the existence of a broad transpressive 

deformation band, comprising a set of WNW-ESE striking, subvertical, dextral 

strike-slip faults (SWIM faults in Fig. 6.1B), which as a whole extend for more 

than 600 km, from the eastern part of the Gulf of Cadiz to the southern limit of 

the Gorringe bank. These faults are interpreted by the cited authors as 

lithospheric faults, and in view of that the SWIM fault system was proposed to 

mark a newly formed plate boundary connecting the AGFZ to the Rif Mountain 

belt in northern Morocco. 

 



98 

 

It should be noted that Zitellini et al. (2009) considered the dextral transcurrent 

SWIM faults in the Gulf of Cadiz as presently active, and cutting the GCAW thrusts, 

whose activity is considered to be negligible since late Miocene times. Conversely, 

Gutscher et al. (2002) consider the GCAW thrusts as still active, and as referred above 

related with Present day on-going subduction beneath the Gibraltar Arc. 

 In the present work, we test the above assumptions using analog modeling sand-

box experiments to model the interference between the two major tectonic systems in 

the Gulf of Cadiz, i.e. SWIM dextral wrenching and GCAW thrusting, assuming three 

main different possibilities: 

 

1) The GCAW is presently active and the SWIM faults are thought to correspond 

to inactive basement faults, inherited from a previous tectonic evolution; 

 

2) The SWIM faults are thought to correspond to major, presently active, dextral  

strike-slips, cutting a previously formed inactive GCAW; 

 

3) Both tectonic systems are presently active. 

 

Thorough comparison of the obtained results with the observed natural 

morphotectonic pattern is carried out for each of the above cases. Accordingly, resulting 

tectonic implications for the local and whole scale evolution of this segment of the 

Eurasia-Africa plate boundary are carefully evaluated and explored.

6.2. Morphotectonic characterization of the study 

area 

 

 The morphology of the Gulf of Cadiz is largely controlled by the main tectonic 

processes in the area: the thrusting accommodating the GCAW accretion and the 

wrenching associated to the SWIM fault system. The high-resolution bathymetry of the 

GCAW shows a west dipping U-shaped body (Figs. 6.1B and 6.2A) that extends for 

more than 250 km from about longitude 7ºW to 9º30‘W, with depths ranging from 200 

to 4300 meters. It narrows slightly to the west with a width varying from 160 to 140 km 

(see Fig. 6.1B and 6.2A). Its wrinkled surface morphology is shaped not only by thrust-

related slope breaks and associated folds, which define a large scale stepping 

morphology, but is also the result of the different combined manifestations of 

gravitational and fluid escape processes (e.g. ?raft-tectonics? type features, sub-circular 

collapse depressions, mud volcanoes, salt diapirs; Mulder et al., 2003; Pinheiro et al., 

2003; Gutscher et al., 2009b; Zitellini et al., 2009; Terrinha et al., 2009). From a 

structural point of view, the accretionary wedge corresponds to an eastward thickening 

pile of westwards thrust sediments (Fig. 6.2B and C), reaching a maximum thickness of 

ca. 15 km near the Gibraltar Straits (Thiebot and Gutscher, 2006; Gutscher et al., 

2009a). The thrusts root in a common sub-horizontal to gently east dipping décollement 

layer, exhibiting an overall geometry complying with on-going eastwards subduction 

beneath the Gibraltar Arc (Gutscher et al., 2002). During the last 5 Ma the E-W 

convergence rate implied in such a subduction is thought to have diminished from ca. 2 

cm/yr to 0.5 cm/yr (Gutscher et al., 2009a), with a consequent decrease in the activity of 

the wedge thrusts during this time span. Accordingly, the same authors argue that the 

Present day internal deformation is preferably accommodated by small increments of 

local reactivation of inherited blind thrusts, being more homogeneously distributed over 

the entire wedge, rather than concentrated on newly formed major frontal thrusts.  

The morphologic expression of the SWIM faults corresponds to a continuous 

alignment of seafloor crests and troughs, sometimes exhibiting an en echelon 

geometrical disposition, and commonly punctuated by active mud volcanoes within the 

domain of the accretionary wedge (see Fig. 6.1B; Duarte et al., 2009; Terrinha et al., 

2009; Zitellini et al., 2009). This overall linear morphology is more prominent both 



100 

 

close to the northern part of the GCAW front and in the Horseshoe Valley, where 

lineaments can be followed almost continuously for more than 200 kilometers (e.g. 

SWIM 1 in Fig. 6.1B and 6.3A). 

 

Figure 6.2 - (A) Perspective view (from southwest) of the Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge surface and 

adjacent areas; (B) Delsis Multichannel seismic profile across the accretionary wedge deformation front 

(see Fig. 6.2A for location) and (C) respective interpretation.  
 

The available reflection seismic dataset in the study area shows that the SWIM 

faults correspond to aligned arrays of deep-rooted faults, often breaching out through 

Present day seafloor sediments and showing extensive evidence for associated fluid 

migration (e.g. seismic blanking along fluid extrusion paths in Fig. 6.3B and C; Rosas et 

al., 2009; Terrinha et al., 2009). From the inspection of the IAM 4 and 3 seismic 

profiles in Fig. 6.3, it is apparent that the SWIM faults are aligned along basement pre-

existent (Mesozoic) faults (dashed black lines in Fig. 6.3; see also Duarte et al., 2009 

and Terrinha et al., 2009). Analog modeling of sets of en echelon folds formed in soft-

cover sediments overlying some of the SWIM basement dextral strike-slips (Rosas et 

al., 2009) yielded an age for their activeness of ca. 1.8 Ma.

6.2.1. The SWIM-GCAW interference area 

 

The critical area to understand the interference between the SWIM strike-slips 

and the GCAW is close to its deformation front (Fig. 6.4A). Along this front, from 

North to South, three interference sub-areas were thoroughly analyzed (B to D in Fig. 

6.4).  The SWIM 2 fault intersects a northern segment of the GCAW front (Fig. 6.4B) in 

the vicinity of the Sagres Valley, at an angle of about 40º. Within the thrust wedge to 

the East, the morphological expression of the SWIM 2 is well marked by a slightly 

arched trough that splays in the same direction. Conversely, in the Sagres Valley it is 

almost indiscernible due to the widespread presence of scours and slumps, and it is only 

detectable by the presence of a gentle slope break. In this area no offset of the wedge 

deformation front is observed, instead only a small wrinkled WNW-ESE elongate bulge 

can be detected in the bathymetry of the frontal GCAW (see Fig. 6.4B). The SWIM 1 

fault exhibits a clear morphological expression in the Horseshoe Valley, intersecting the 

wedge deformation front just to the north of the Coral Patch Ridge, at an angle of about 

70º (Fig. 6.4C). Its continuation to the East is less visible, although punctuated by mud 

volcanoes. Similarly to what was described for the SWIM 2 fault, there is no 

bathymetric evidence for the offset of the wedge front by the SWIM 1 fault. The SWIM 

3 fault cuts along the southern flank of the Coral Patch Ridge with a strong 

morphological imprint (Fig. 6.4D), corresponding to a lineament marked by several 

elongated WNW-ESE ridges, troughs and slope breaks. To the East, this lineament 

crosses a small portion of the Seine Abyssal Plain and intersects the accretionary wedge 

deformation front, at an angle of about 80º. In this location the wedge front is marked 

by a slight embayment. On the wedge surface to the north of the fault and parallel to it, 

an elongated protuberance is also unmistakably observed, limited by two descending 

slope breaks and vanishing progressively towards the East. As in the two cases 

described above, the observed morphology does not account for any kind of fault offset 

overprint relationships.

104 

 

6.3. Analog Modeling 

 

 Our objective is to test several simple chronological possibilities of mechanical 

interference between a strike-slip fault and a thrust wedge front, under model conditions 

comparable to the ones governing the SWIM-GCAW tectonic interference. Three main 

experiments were carried out to investigate the different deformation patterns resulting 

from: a) A thrust wedge developed on top of an inactive basement (strike-slip) fault; b) 

An active dextral strike-slip fault affecting an inactive thrust wedge; c) The 

simultaneous alternate activity of a thrust wedge front and a dextral strike-slip fault. 

Experiments were performed to respect the general, simplified, geometry, kinematics 

and rheology ascribed to the natural strike-slip (SWIM) system, and to the (GCAW) 

thrust wedge. However, analog modeling with dry granular materials cannot reproduce 

all the complex processes (e.g. fluid overpressure and expulsion, sedimentary 

deposition, and local gravitational instabilities) which occur in submarine environments. 

Nevertheless, the regional kinematic and relative timing caused by the local tectonic 

driving forces and the ensuing structural evolution can be well investigated.      

 

 

6.3.1. Experimental method 

 

6.3.1.1. Material properties and scaling 

  

The material used as an analog of the GCAW sedimentary rocks was dry quartz 

sand, whose properties are summarized in Table 6.1. Sand is considered a Coulomb 

material deforming in a brittle way according to the Coulomb fracture criterion (e.g. 

Hubbert, 1937, 1951; Davis et al., 1983, Appendix 6.A), and it has been extensively 

used in scaled model experiments simulating similar brittle deformation in the upper 

crust (e.g. Mandl et al., 1977; Davis et al., 1983; Malavieille, 1984; Mulugeta, 1988; 

Malavieille et al., 1991; Liu et al., 1992; Gutscher et al., 1998a,b; Casas et al., 2001; 

Marques and Cobbold, 2002; Le Guerroue and Cobbold, 2006; Rosas et al., 2009; 

Gutscher et al., 2009a; Malavieille, 2010). The present models were properly scaled 



105 

 

according to the scale model theory of Hubbert (1937). The assumed model - prototype 

ratios are presented in Table 6.1, and the detailed procedure of scaling is specified in 

Appendix 6.A  

 

 

Table 6.1 - Parameters and material properties 

 

Note: 

- Scaled fundamental units are in bold 

- A mean cohesion of Co=40 MPa was assumed from the natural prototype (e.g. Hoshino et al., 1972; Weijermars et al., 1993) 

 

 

6.3.1.2. Apparatus and initial stage  

 

Experiments were done using a rectangular 100cm × 60cm Perspex deformation 

rig, comprising two laterally juxtaposed basal plates and a moving backstop (Fig. 6.5A). 

In the initial stage of the experiments, 1cm thick layered sand cake was built on top of 

the basal rigid plates by pouring batches of differently colored sand from a moving 

elongated funnel, guarantying the leveling of its top surface. The basal plates in the 

model move laterally relatively to each other, and account for the natural basement 

beneath the thrust wedge décollement (see Fig. 6.2C). The vertical contact plane 

between these plates complies with the dominant WNW-ESE orientation of the SWIM 1 

fault system (see Fig. 6.1 and 6.4). The model sand cake corresponds to the overlying 

cover sediments, in which accretion is simulated by pushing against it a backstop that

slides on top of both basal plates. The backstop lacks any kind of correspondence with 

any natural feature, and was exclusively used to produce a classical model thrust wedge. 

Likewise the (~0.2 cm thick) layering in the sand cake has also no correspondence with 

any natural structures, and was used merely as a 3D passive strain marker. In all 

experiments the dimensions of the deformation rig were sufficiently large to guarantee 

that the bulk of the model was not affected by boundary conditions. The experiments 

were repeated several times to ensure the reproducibility of the obtained results. Top 

view photographs were taken at regular time intervals. The final stage of the model was 

humidified and serially sectioned for three-dimensional analysis.

after 20 % of shortening.  

 

6.3.1.3. Procedure  

 

Three main experiments were carried out two study three basic possibilities of 

mechanical interference between a strike-slip basement fault and a thrust wedge: 

1) Active thrust wedge and inactive basement fault: the backstop was initially 

pushed against the sand-cake, on top of the two immobile basal plates. 

2) Active basement fault and inactive thrust wedge: after a thrust wedge was 

previously formed in the sand, the basal plates were dextrally moved relatively 

to each other. 

 



107 

 

3) Active basement fault and active thrust wedge: the reactivation of a 

previously formed thrust wedge was successively alternated with the right-lateral 

movement between the basal plates. 

  

 

6.3.2. Experimental results 

  

6.3.2.1. Experiment 1: active thrust wedge and inactive basement 

fault  

 

 Up until ~30% of shortening a thrust wedge was classically obtained, through 

the forward propagation of regularly spaced thrusts, as a result of moving the backstop 

to the left (see Fig. 6.5B and Fig. 6.6A). For a shortening of 31 % (Fig. 6.6A) the front 

of the accretionary wedge developed an embayment coinciding with the direction of the 

inactive basement fault (yellow dashed line in Fig. 6.6A). For a shortening of 38 % a 

new thrust (n+1 in Fig. 6.6B) was formed exclusively to the north of that basement 

discontinuity. Only when the shortening reached 39 %, did the equivalent new thrust 

form to the south, resulting in a misleading left-lateral offset geometry (yellow arrows 

in Fig. 6.6C), in spite of the total absence of relative movement between the two basal 

rigid plates. For a shortening of 48 % this false offset in front of the newer thrust 

disappeared (Fig. 6.6D). In the wedge lower area a linear southeastward splaying, 

slightly anastomosing, deformation pattern (white lines in Fig. 6.6D) was progressively 

developed as shortening accumulated and new outward thrusts successively formed.

6.3.2.2. Experiment 2: active basement fault and inactive thrust 

wedge 

  

After 48% of shortening the basement strike-slip fault was activated with dextral 

movement (Fig. 6.7). When the horizontal displacement between the basal plates 

reached only 0.2 cm, a thin elongated bulge formed coinciding with the basement strike-

slip direction (Fig. 6.7A). At this stage no offset of the thrust wedge was observed. A 

further right-lateral displacement of 0.6 cm between the basal plates clearly offset the 

thrust wedge, preferably affecting its frontal outer thrust (Fig. 6.7B). For a displacement 

of 1.3 cm the strike-slip fault seemingly propagated inwards, but only across the 



109 

 

following three thrusts (Fig. 6.7C-D). The resultant model deformation pattern always 

showed the preferential offset of the frontal thin part of the accretionary wedge, relative 

to its innermost domains that remained unaffected.

6.3.2.3. Experiment 3: active basement fault and active thrust 

wedge  

  

After the formation of a thrust wedge due to 47% of shortening, a right-lateral 

displacement of 1cm was applied to the basal plates (Fig. 6.8A). As a result, a linear 

bulge formed in the sand foreland, along the strike-slip direction, cutting across the 

thrust wedge and offsetting its front. Similarly to experiment 2, the amount of right-

lateral displacement diminished towards the thicker inner part of the wedge. 

Subsequently, another 0.4% of incremental shortening was applied to the model (Fig. 

6.8B). As a result, a new frontal thrust formed, but only to the north of the strike-slip 

fault. The resultant geometry mimics a false left-lateral offset of the outer frontal thrust 

(apparently n+1 in Fig. 6.8B), although careful consideration of the propagation 

chronology of the thrusts revealed a true dextral offset (affecting thrust n  in Fig. 6.8B), 

complying with the underlying basement fault kinematics. Further 1% of applied 

shortening (Fig. 6.8C) produced the new thrust (n+1) also to the south of the strike-slip 

fault, erasing the previously formed false offset. Another 3.5 cm of dextral strike-slip 

displacement was additionally applied to the basal plates (Fig. 6.8D), and as a 

consequence, the wedge front was once more kinematically truly dextrally offset. Riedel 

faults formed on the wedge surface displaying a clear en echelon spatial disposition, and 

interfering with the preexistent stepping morphology associated with the thrust stacking. 

Finally, after another 2.6% of shortening (Fig. 6.9), reaching a total accumulated 

amount of 51%, the frontal wedge offset was once again almost completely attenuated, 

although the total accumulated basal strike-slip displacement was of 4.5 cm 

(corresponding to 22.5 km). It should be noted that the previously formed linear en 

echelon pattern was preserved in the wedge surface, including in its innermost domain.

6.4. Discussion 

 

 Experiment 1 shows that an active thrust wedge forming in cover sediments 

above an inactive basement fault records the resultant mechanical interference in the 

form of a linear, inner splaying, perturbation of the wedge morphological surface (white 

lines in Fig. 6.6C-D). This formed as the result of the successive thrust propagation 

across the basement anisotropy, which behaved as a mechanical obstacle for the lateral 

propagation of the frontal thrust. Since this basement anisotropy remains stationary 

relatively to an external reference frame, and the thrust front propagates forward (to the 

left), the resultant interference area between both these features migrates from the lower 

periphery of the thrust front to its central domain (compare the position of the linear 

perturbation pattern in Figs. 6.6A to D). Comparison with the natural example shows 

that the observed inner splaying lineaments in the GCAW (see SWIM 1 in Fig. 6.1B 

and SWIM 2 in Fig. 6.4B), could have originated simply as a consequence of 

preexisting inactive basement faults. This agrees with the fact that these lineaments are 

observed in the inner thicker part of the natural thrust wedge, in the complete absence of 

offset of its thinner frontal part. 

 Experiment 2 shows that an active basement strike-slip fault affecting an 

overlying preexistent thrust-wedge, must produce a clear offset of its thinner front, even 

for minor increments of strike-slip basal displacement (1.3 cm corresponding to 6.5 

Km). This offset vanishes rapidly towards the inner thicker parts of the wedge, affecting 

almost exclusively the outer frontal thrusts. Comparison with the natural example shows 

that if the GCAW is presently inactive, and cut by active dextral strike-slip (SWIM) 

faults, then unambiguous offset of the GCAW front has to exist, which is clearly not the 

case (see Figs. 6.1B, 6.2 and 6.4). 

 Experiment 3 shows that if both the basal strike-slip fault and the thrust wedge 

are active, with alternating incremental fault slips, then the resultant interference 

deformation pattern can be the cyclic repetition of the following three possibilities: a) 

true right-lateral offset of the thrust wedge front (see Fig. 6.8A and D); b) false left-

lateral offset of the thrust wedge front (see Fig. 6.8B, similar to experiment 1 see Fig. 

6.6C); c) no offset of the thrust wedge front (see Fig. 6.8C and 6.9). It should be noted 

that the absence of thrust wedge offset does not imply an absence of basement strike-



113 

 

slip displacement, which quite on the contrary is continually increasing. However, the 

alternation with the incremental shortening that drives the successive forward thrust 

propagation cyclically erases the offset of the frontal thrust wedge. Differently, the 

resultant linear en echelon interference pattern tends to be increasingly well marked, 

including in the innermost domains of the thrust wedge (compare the lineament in the 

Figs. 6.8A and 6.9). Similarly to experiment 1, the intermediate experimental stage in 

which a false left-lateral offset originates (see Fig. 6.8B), is here interpreted as the result 

of a delayed propagation of the newer outer thrust across the strike-slip fault, which in 

accordance seemingly behaves as a mechanical obstacle to such propagation.  

 In view of these results, and considering the fact that in the natural example the 

GCAW front is not offset across any of the mapped SWIM faults, one of the two 

following tectonic scenarios is possible: a) either the GCAW is active, and forming over 

a basement anisotropy (inactive SWIM fault?); or b) Both the GCAW and the SWIM 

faults are active. The possibility of an inactive GCAW being cut by active dextral 

strike-slip SWIM faults is clearly ruled out by the present experimental results.  

 

 

6.4.1. Tectonic implications 

 

 The west Mediterranean tectonic evolution comprised the Mesozoic opening of 

the Tethys Ocean (Fig. 6.10A; e.g. Maldonado et al., 1999; Gutscher et al., 2002; Gràcia 

et al., 2003a; Stampli et al., 2002; Jiménez-Munt et al., 2010). This would account for a 

basement tectonic anisotropy, hypothetically, either consisting in previous transform 

faults, or in rift-related normal faults (Fig. 6.10A and B). In view of the presented 

experimental results, the accretionary wedge (GCAW) is here interpreted to have 

formed on top of such basement faults (present day SWIM faults) as a consequence of 

roll-back subduction beneath Gibraltar. During this period (Middle Miocene to 

~1.8Ma?, Figs. 6.10C to E) these faults were probably inactive, although capable of 

originating a linear-like perturbation in the GCAW surface morphology (experiment 1). 

At same time, the main regional convergence direction between Iberia and Nubia 

gradually suffered a counterclockwise rotation, shifting from N-S (Fig. 6.10 B) to near 



114 

 

WNW-ESE (Fig. 6.10E). Such reorientation is interpreted to have triggered (since at 

least ~1.8Ma) a dextral strike-slip reactivation of the basement (SWIM) faults (Fig. 

6.10F), during a period in which the subduction driving the GCAW growth was still 

active (experiment 3), although slowing down (Gutscher, 2009a). It should be noted that 

this rotation of the main convergence direction also agrees with the general strain 

partitioning tectonic scenario previously proposed by Terrinha et al. (2009), according 

to which besides dextral strike slip faulting along near E-W orientated faults, northwest 

directed thrusts also occur along NE-SW orientated tectonic structures (e.g. Horseshoe, 

Marquês de Pombal and Gorringe faults in Fig. 6.1B).   

Other indirect evidence supporting Present day SWIM and GCAW simultaneous 

activity include the fact that, not only all known mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz are 

located on top of the accretionary wedge, but also the circumstance that most of the 

deep mud volcanoes are symptomatically aligned and coincident with the SWIM faults 

(Fig. 6.1A). This suggests that the fluid migration and escape may be simultaneously 

controlled by the activity of both structures. If that is in fact the case, then the mud 

volcanoes could be preferentially located in the intersection between the SWIM strike-

slip and the GCAW thrust faults, with such loci providing good pathways for the fluid 

to ascend (Pinheiro et al., 2003, 2005; Duarte et al., 2005; Rosas et al., 2009; Zitellini et 

al., 2009; Terrinha et al., 2009).

6.5. Conclusions 

 

1. In view of the presented experimental results, the observed morphotectonic 

pattern of the frontal GCAW area is compatible with: 

i) The development of the GCAW on top of inactive, previously formed, 

basement faults (present day SWIM fault system). 

ii) The simultaneously (alternating) activity of the GCAW thrusting with the 

activity of the SWIM-related dextral strike-slip faults. 

 

Conversely, the comparison of the same experimental results with the natural example 

unambiguously excludes the possibility of active strike-slip faulting (SWIM system) 

affecting an inactive preexistent GCAW, implying that if the SWIM fault system is 

active then the GCAW must also be presently active.  

 

2. The main tectonic implications of the above conclusions comprise an initial 

(Middle Miocene to ~1.8 Ma) accretion of the GCAW sediments on top of 

preexistent Tethyan rift-related faults, preceding strike-slip reactivation of these 

faults (SWIM system), simultaneously with decreasing GCAW activity (~1.8 

Ma to Present), as a function of counterclockwise rotation of the main Iberia-

Nubia convergence direction.  

3. The modeling and morphological observations favor the interpretation of the 

SWIM fault system as the strike-slip reactivation of pre-existent basement faults. 

This suggests that the SWIM plate boundary proposed by Zitellini et al. (2009) 

may in fact correspond to the local reactivation of the older Tethyan plate 

boundary.

Chapter appendix 6.A. - Scaling 

 

 The material used as an analog of the upper crust sedimentary rocks was dry 

quartz sand, which is considered a Coulomb material deforming in a brittle way 

according to the Coulomb fracture criterion (e.g. Hubbert, 1937, 1951; Davis et al., 

1983): 

 

                

 

where     is the shear stress,    is the coefficient of internal friction (       , and 

   internal friction angle),    is the normal stress, and    is the cohesion of the 

material. According to the scale model theory (Hubbert, 1937), proper scaling is 

achieved when the ratios between model and natural prototype are independently 

established for the three fundamental units of length (?), time (?) and mass (?): 

 

   
    

    
    

    

    
    

    

    
     

 

where   = length,   = time and   = mass, and ( ) stands for model and ( ) for natural 

prototype. The Coulomb fracture criterion governs time independent deformation of 

brittle materials like sedimentary upper crustal rocks, since yield stress is insensitive to 

the rate of deformation provided that the inertial forces are negligible, as in the present 

case. This means that   ratio is not needed for scaling in this situation. Length ratio ( ) 

was chosen given the maximum dimensions of the deformation apparatus used in the 

experiments (see section 3), and was conveniently established as         . In the 

present case, of the two relevant material properties, coefficient of internal friction (  ) 

and cohesion (  ), the first is dimensionless, and approximately the same in both model 

and prototype, whereas the second has dimension of stress and thus must be scaled 

accordingly (Hubbert, 1937): 



118 

 

 

  
     

     
 

  

  
      

 

where   and   are the model/prototype ratio for stress and for acceleration respectively. 

Since inertial forces are negligible when compared with gravity, 

 

     
    

    
 

 

  
       

 

where    is the model/prototype gravity acceleration ratio. Thus, substituting     in 

equation (3) allows the following simplification: 

 

  
     

     
 

 

  
 

  

  
         

 

where   corresponds to the model/prototype density ratio. Substituting   and   in 

equation (5) by the respective values in Table 6.1, immediately allows the determination 

of the implied mass ratio         . It should also be noted that since   is generally 

close to one (between 0.5 and 0.7, e.g. Withjack et al., 2007) the strength of the 

materials expressed by   is scaled with the lengh ( ). Given the fact that in the present 

case          and since cohesion for upper crustal rocks is clearly typically less 

than 50 MPa, it becomes immediately evident the utility of model materials with very 

low cohesion (&lt;100Pa), such as dry quartz sand, as analogs of upper crustal rocks.

Abstract 

 

The process of spontaneous subduction initiation at passive margins played a 

central role in the original Wilson Cycle concept. However, recent works showed that it 

is not feasible to form a new subduction zone in isolation from a previous existing one. 

The unraveled tectonic framework of the Gibraltar Arc and the Southwest Iberia Margin 

(presented and discussed in the previous chapters) is here used as a case study to 

address the role that orogenic arcs may have in the nucleation of new subduction zones 

at passive margins. An updated tectonic map of the Gulf of Cadiz (the foreland of the 

Gibraltar Arc) is presented and analyzed in the view of the more recent published 

works, and the possible tectonic reactivation of the Southwest Iberia Margin is 

evaluated within the context of the two main driving mechanisms accounting for the 

recognized tectonic structures in the area: the westward over-thrusting of the Gibraltar 

Arc and the Present day WNW-ESE dextral oblique convergence between Nubia and 

Iberia. The role of orogenic arcs in the formation of new subduction systems is 

hypothetically proposed as of significant importance in plate tectonics.

7.1. Introduction 

 

The Wilson Cycle is one of the most paradigmatic ideas in the plate tectonic 

theory, stating that oceans form, evolve and finally close (Wilson, 1966). This process 

requires that after a certain time of the evolution of an ocean, the passive margins 

collapse and new subduction systems initiate. However, the process by which a passive 

margin converts into an active margin is still controversial and fundamentally unknown 

(Nikolaeva, et al., 2010; Stern, 2002; Stern, 2004; Gurnis et al., 2004). There are even 

substantial doubts whether if it is possible to initiate a new subduction system in 

isolation from a previous existing one (e.g. Guarnis et al., 2004; Stern, 2004). Also, 

despite the abundance of both passive and active continental margins on Earth, no cases 

of transition between these two types of margins has been identified (Nikolaeva et al., 

2010). The quest for the identification of an incipient subduction zone at a ?passive 

margin? is a challenge in modern plate tectonics. A natural case study would permit to 

constrain the previously amount of proposed models on subduction initiation (see a list 

in Nikolaeva et al., 2010; and Table 2.1 in Chapter 2) and allow a better understanding 

on the forces driving and resisting plate tectonics (Guarnis et al., 2004).  

The margins of the Atlantic Ocean are generally described as the typical case of 

passive margins, often termed Atlantic type margins (Gibbs, 1984). However, there are 

two regions where Atlantic oceanic lithosphere is already being consumed in subduction 

zones: in the Scotia and in the Lesser Antilles arcs (Fig. 7.1, Deuser, 1970; Schellart and 

Lister, 2004; Goren et al., 2008). These subduction zones are thought to have been 

transferred from the Eastern Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic domain (Mueller and Phillips, 

1991; Royden, 1993; Goren et al., 2008), and have been described as potential 

precursors to a system of convergent zones that might ultimately result in the closing of 

the Atlantic Ocean (Mueller and Phillips, 1991).  

The Gulf of Cadiz, i.e. the foreland of the Gibraltar Arc (or Betic-Rif Arc; Fig. 

7.1 and 7.2), is the third place that has been described as potential locus for a subduction 

to propagate into the open Atlantic (Royden, 1993), as the result of active roll-back of a 

narrow oceanic corridor that once connected the Tethyan basin and the Atlantic 

(Gutscher et al., 2002). On the other hand, the proximity of the westward migrating 

Gibraltar Arc to the Southwest Iberia Margin (see Fig. 7.2), together with the Present 



122 

 

day WNW-ESE convergence between Nubia and Iberia, induces compressive stresses 

that make this margin a strong candidate for the nucleation of a new subduction zone, in 

accordance to what was previously proposed by Ribeiro et al. (1996). The anomalous 

high magnitude seismicity in this area, such as the magnitude &gt;8.5 Great Lisbon 

Earthquake of 1755 and the 28/02/1969 earthquake (M~8; Fukao, 1973), complies with 

such a scenario (Gutscher, 2004 and 2006; Ribeiro et al., 2006).

boundaries; thick gray lines indicate divergent or transform plate boundaries (Adapted from Schellart and 

Lister, 2004); grey areas roughly correspond to back-arc basins. 

 



123 

 

Using the Gibraltar Arc and Southwest Iberia Margin as case studies, the present 

work aims at providing insights on the role that preexistent orogenic arcs may have in 

the reactivation of passive margins and subduction initiation. The discussion is based on 

an updated tectonic map of this region, based on which the prevailing tectonic driving 

mechanisms that account for the observed structures were recently interpreted (see 

Chapter 4; Duarte et al., 2009; Terrinha et al., 2009; Rosas et al., 2009, in appendix 

Duarte et al., submitted, Chapter 6). The key question concerning whether the Gibraltar 

subduction zone is active and propagating into the open Atlantic domain, or practically 

inactive at its present location but a new subduction zone is nucleating westwards along 

the West Iberia Margin (see Fig. 7.2) is also addressed and tentatively answered.

(Iberia) - Africa (Nubia) plate boundary. 

 

 

 



124 

 

7.2. The problem of subduction initiation at 

passive margins 

 

Assuming that various Wilson Cycles occurred in the last 1 to 2 Ga, the almost 

complete absence of oceanic crust older than 200 Ma suggests that new subduction 

systems have to initiate repeatedly at passive margins in order to close the oceans that 

were once formed (Goren et al., 2008). In addition, passive margins have long been 

considered the more logical place for subduction to initiate, for two main reasons: i) 

most of the existing subduction zones are located along continental margins and ii) the 

Present day state of relatively young oceanic lithosphere is only achieved if the oldest 

oceanic lithosphere, which occurs at passive margins, is subducted before younger 

lithosphere (Goren et al., 2008; Nikolaeva et al., 2010). It is traditionally assumed that 

spontaneous subduction initiation at passive margins occurs when the cold 

gravitationally unstable oceanic lithosphere collapses into the asthenosphere, as 

consequence of density excess due to its aging. However, several works showed that the 

strength of the oceanic lithosphere also increases with aging and consequently does not 

make it more susceptible to spontaneously collapse into the asthenosphere (see Fig. 2.2 

in Chapter 2; Mueller and Phillips, 1991; see also McKenzie, 1977 and Cloetingh et al., 

1984;). This conclusion is supported by the existence of 170 Ma old oceanic lithosphere 

adjacent to the Northwest of Africa and the Northeastern American passive margins. On 

the other hand, the geological record does not seem to reveal one single example of an 

Atlantic-type margin evolving spontaneously into an Andean-type margin (Mueller and 

Phillips, 1991). One way to overcome this apparent contradiction is to consider that 

subduction initiation at passive margins may generally be induced by the proximity of 

another subduction zone or by stress transference from a nearby subduction zone or 

collision belt. Therefore, passive margins in the proximity of a mature subduction 

complex would represent preferential sites for trench formation (Muller and Philips, 

1991).  

 

 

 



125 

 

7.2.1. The peri-Atlantic arcs and the “infection” of the Atlantic 

 

The Atlantic is almost entirely bounded by passive margins (see Fig. 7.1). 

However, according to some authors, the Atlantic has already entered in its closing 

phase (e.g. Mueller and Philips, 1991; Ribeiro et al., 2006). In fact, there are two 

regions where Atlantic oceanic lithosphere is by now being consumed in subduction 

zones: in the Scotia and in the Lesser Antilles arcs (Deuser, 1970; Goren et al., 2008; 

see Fig. 7.1). These arcs seem to correspond to cases where the initiation of the 

subduction was induced by the proximity of another subduction system. It was proposed 

that these two systems formed due to stress transmission across narrow continental 

landmasses that once existed between the Pacific and the Atlantic (see Fig. 2.5 in 

Chapter 2; Mueller and Philips, 1991; Goren et al., 2008). Mueller and Philips (1991) 

used an interesting and particularly creative analogy to describe this phenomenon. They 

consider that subduction zones may be introduced into a pristine oceanic basin (i.e. 

without subduction zones), in a way that might be viewed, figuratively, as a process in 

which an infected ocean (i.e. with subduction zones) comes in contact with, and infects, 

an uninfected basin. It should be noted that both the Scotia and Lesser Antilles arcs are 

propagating along two transform plate boundaries that connect these arcs to the Mid-

Atlantic Ridge (see Fig. 7.1). The third limit of this type in the Atlantic is the Azores-

Gibraltar Fracture Zone, which extends from the Azores triple junction (in the Mid-

Atlantic Ridge) to the foreland of the Gibraltar Arc (see Fig. 7.1). This area was 

proposed to be the third place where an initial stage of this ?infection? process could be 

occurring at the present (Mueller and Philips, 1991; Royden, 1993). However, both the 

Scotia and the Lesser Antilles arcs have retreated around 2000 km and their trenches do 

not seem to have propagated laterally, along the adjacent passive margins (see Fig. 7.1), 

contrary to the foreland of the Gibraltar Arc, where the deformation is propagating 

northeastwards along the Southwest Iberia Margin (see Chapter 4; Terrinha et al., 2009 

in appendix; and further in this chapter). We hypothesize that this difference may be 

related to the fact that the plates bounding the Gibraltar Arc, Nubia and Eurasia (Fig. 

7.2), are converging, which is not the case with the plates bounding the Scotia and the 

Lesser Antilles arcs. This convergence may constrain the arc laterally inducing the 

migration of the deformation away from it into the Atlantic.

7.3. The case study of the Gulf of Cadiz  

 

7.3.1. Main tectonic features 
 

 In the Gulf of Cadiz tectonic map shown in Fig. 7.3 it is possible to identify 

three main tectonic systems: i) the subduction-related Accretionary Wedge (marked in 

grey); ii) a set of WNW-ESE striking dextral strike-slip faults (the SWIM fault system; 

marked in white); and iii) a group of NE-SW striking northwest-directed thrusts 

concentrated in the Southwest Iberia Margin (marked in yellow).

127 

 

7.3.1.1. The Subduction-related Accretionary Wedge 

 

The accretionary wedge occupies a broad area of the Gulf of Cadiz (see Fig. 7.3) 

and its influence on the seafloor is materialized by a west dipping U-shaped surface that 

extends for more than 250 km from about longitude 7º to 9º30‘. From the structural 

point of view, this feature consists in an eastward thickening pile of westwards thrusted 

sediments that may exceed 10 km of thickness (Thiebot and Gutscher, 2006; Gutscher et 

al., 2009a; Duarte et al., submitted). The thrusts root in a gently east dipping 

décollement layer, exhibiting an overall geometry compatible with on-going eastwards 

subduction beneath the Gibraltar Arc (Gutscher et al., 2002 and 2009a,b). The existence 

of a subduction zone in this area is supported by seismic tomography data, which shows 

an east dipping slab below the Gibraltar Arc prolonging 670 km deep into the mantle. 

This subduction zone is believed to have developed within the Mediterranean Alpine 

Collision Belt and is a remnant of the subduction system that consumed most of the 

Western Mediterranean Tethyan Ocean during the Cenozoic (Lonergan and White, 

1997; Rosenbaum et al., 2002). Gutscher et al. (2002) proposed that the subduction is 

still active and retreating westwards along an East-West trending corridor of remnant 

(Jurassic) oceanic lithosphere. The presence of such an oceanic corridor was recently 

confirmed by seismic refraction data (Sallarès et al., 2011). Also, recent detailed 

structural mapping of the Horseshoe Valley area revealed the existence of an intriguing 

set of kilometric crescentic depressions lying at depths between -4300 and -4700 m 

(Fig. 7.4A; see location in Fig. 7.3; see also Chapter 5 for a detailed study on the origin 

of these features - Duarte et al., 2010). The thorough analysis of seismic reflection 

profiles from this area revealed that: i) the crescentic depressions are carved on the edge 

of morphological slope breaks (see Fig. 7.4A); ii) the morphology of the depressions is 

shaped by the interaction of downslope currents with this slope breaks; and iii) the slope 

breaks are tectonically controlled by blind thrusts that root at the level of the 

accretionary wedge décollement (see Fig. 7.4B). These blind thrusts are located to the 

west and in front of the outermost limit of the accretionary wedge (thrusts marked in 

grey in Fig. 7.3). These features are thus interpreted as the morphological (i.e. 

bathymetric) expression of Present day westward propagation of the accretionary 

wedge.

7.3.1.2. The NE-SW striking thrust system  

 

The generally NE-SW striking thrust system comprises mainly the Horseshoe 

fault, the Marquês de Pombal fault, the Tagus Abyssal Plain fault and the Gorringe 

northern thrust (Fig. 7.3; Zitellini et al., 1999; Gràcia et al., 2003a,b; Terrinha et al., 

2003; Rovere et al., 2004; Zitellini et al., 2004; Terrinha et al., 2009; Cunha et al., 

2010). This thrust system extends for approximately 300 km from the Coral Patch 

Ridge area (35.5ºN), towards the north, along the West Portuguese Margin until a 

latitude of 38ºN, with an apparent en echelon spatial disposition (see thrusts marked in 

yellow in Fig. 7.3). The thrust structures have prominent escarpments reaching up to 

2000 meters in height and seem to root deep into the basement, possibly cutting into the 

mantle, as suggested by seismic imagery and deep instrumental seismicity (Stich et al., 

2007; Terrinha et al., 2009; Cunha et al., 2010; Silva et al., 2010). According to 

Terrinha et al. (2009), this NE-SW striking thrust system is the result of the migration of 

the deformation from the realm of the Gibraltar wedge to the west (onto the Horseshoe 

fault region) and to the north along the West Portuguese Margin. This migration is 

believed to have been caused in part by the rotation of the convergence direction 

between Nubia and Iberia since the Miocene (Terrinha et al., 2009). The same authors 

considered that these structures may be the expression of a new compressive 

deformation front, away from the Gibraltar Arc and along the West Iberia Margin, 

corresponding to the onset of its tectonic inversion, which could eventually lead to the 

nucleation of a subduction zone (Ribeiro et al., 1996). Note that in this region, the 

Gorringe Bank (see Fig. 7.3) was shown to be mostly constituted by highly 

serpentinized mantle peridotites (Girardeau et al., 1998; Jimenez-Munt et al., 2010). 

Serpentinization, in addition to induced compression, can provide an efficient 

weakening mechanism that may facilitate lithospheric rupture and subduction initiation 

(Cloetingh et al., 1984; Masson et al., 1994). 

 

 

 

 



130 

 

7.3.1.3. The SWIM fault system 

 

The SWIM fault system is a group of WNW-ESE striking subvertical structures, 

interpreted as dextral strike-slip faults (Terrinha et al., 2009; Rosas et al., 2009), 

extending from the eastern part of the Gulf of Cadiz across the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain 

(see Fig. 7.3; Duarte et al., 2009; Terrinha et al., 2009; Zitellini et al., 2009). The SWIM 

faults were interpreted by Zitellini et al. (2009) as corresponding to a newly formed 

dextral transcurrent plate boundary connecting the Azores-Gibraltar Fracture Zone (see 

Fig. 7.1) to the Rif Mountain belt in northern Morocco. The morphologic expression of 

the SWIM faults corresponds to a more or less continuous alignment of seafloor crests 

and troughs locally punctuated by active mud volcanoes within the domain of the 

accretionary wedge (Hensen et al., 2007). Terrinha et al. (2009) and Duarte et al. (2009) 

showed that these WNW-ESE structures seem to correspond to the dextral reactivation 

of basement normal faults probably formed during Mesozoic extensional events. 

Furthermore, the morphotectonic interpretation of strike-slip associated en echelon 

folds, based on analogue modeling experiments, suggested that the dextral movement 

initiated at least 1.8 Ma ago (Rosas et al., 2009).  The SWIM fault system may be 

presently acting as a transfer zone connecting the two main compressive systems (the 

Gibraltar Arc/GCAW and the Southwest Iberia NE-SW thrusts).  

 

 

7.3.1.4. Thrust-wrench tectonic interference in the study area  

 

 Assuming that the SWIM dextral strike-slip faults are active (Zitellini et al., 

2009) and cutting other (also active) structures, such as the Horseshoe thrust fault and 

the accretionary wedge (Terrinha et al., 2009; Gutscher et al., 2002, Fig. 7.3), some kind 

of tectonic interference is expected to occur between these major tectonic features, 

eventually expressed by complying cross-cutting relationships, or corresponding 

interference structural patterns. Confirming this, Rosas et al. (submitted) reported, 

characterized and modeled the tectonic interference pattern between the SWIM 1 fault 

and the Horseshoe thrust fault, mostly consisting in secondary ?corner? faults 

connecting the two tectonic systems as a result of ongoing thrust-wrench interference in 



131 

 

this specific area (see ?corner faults? shown in red in Fig. 7.3 and Rosas et al., 

submitted, in appendix). Likewise, based on analog modeling experiments, Duarte et al. 

(submitted; see Chapter 6) showed that the observed morphotectonic interference 

pattern between the SWIM faults and the accretionary wedge thrust front is not 

compatible with the possibility previously put forward by Zitellini et al. (2009), 

according to which the accretionary wedge is presently inactive and cut by active 

translithospheric (SWIM) dextral strike-slip faults. These same authors showed that if 

this was the case, an important dextral offset (at least c.a. 7 km) of the accretionary 

wedge deformation front should occur, and be plainly observed, which is simply not 

observed in the surveyed bathymetry (Figs. 7.3 and 7.4; see Duarte et al., submitted). 

Instead, the same reported modeling results suggest that the easiest way to explain the 

observed absence of cross-cutting relationships is by considering both the SWIM and 

accretionary wedge active (Duarte et al., submitted – Chapter 6). Also, based on the 

same results these authors interpreted the SWIM system as the strike-slip reactivation of 

pre-existent rift-related basement faults, originally formed during the opening of the 

Alpine-Tethys, rather than corresponding to the expression of the onset of a new plate 

boundary as previously proposed (by Zitellini et al, 2009). 

 

 

7.3.2. Was the 1755 Great Lisbon Earthquake a subduction-

related event? 
 

One major issue that should be taken into account when trying to understand 

significance of the main tectonic structures in the Gulf of Cadiz (and Southwest Iberia 

Margin) is the 1755 Great Lisbon Earthquake that had an estimated magnitude between 

8.5 and 8.9 (Johnston, 1996; Batista et al., 1998). The location of the source of this 

historical earthquake still remains one of the major unsolved questions regarding the 

tectonics of this area (e.g. Gutscher et al., 2002; Terrinha et al., 2009 and Zitellini et al., 

2009). Gutscher et al. (2002; 2004) argued that the 1755 earthquake requires a rupture 

area only compatible with a subduction zone plane and proposed the Gibraltar Arc 

subduction as the most reliable source. Their argument was not only based on the 

geological and geophysical data, but also in the fact that most of the large magnitude 

earthquakes (M?8.5) are generated in subduction zones. Accordingly, 11 of the 12 



132 

 

greatest earthquakes (M?8.5) of the past 100 years occurred along subduction fault 

planes (the exception was a magnitude 8.6 earthquake in the Himalaya collision belt). 

However, the Gulf of Cadiz subduction fault plane shows negligible instrumental high 

magnitude seismicity. Gutscher et al. (2006) offers three possible explanations for such 

an absence: (1) subduction is inactive and has ceased; (2) subduction is active, but 

aseismic; (3) subduction is active and a locked seimogenic zone exists, gradually 

accumulating stress until it releases the next great earthquake. Based on recently 

acquired seafloor and GPS data the authors favor the last hypothesis. Ribeiro et al. 

(2006) agree that the source mechanism of such a large earthquake requires generation 

at a subduction zone. However, they proposed that the source of the 1755 event was not 

the Gibraltar Arc subduction, but an incipient subduction zone that would be presently 

developing in the West Iberia Margin. Terrinha et al. (2009) proposed that the 

Horseshoe, Marquês de Pombal, Tagus Abyssal Plain and Gorringe compressive 

structures are the crustal expression of this hypothetical incipient subduction zone (see 

Fig. 7.2 and 7.3). Some of these structures may be linked at depth and/or connected by 

lateral ramps, providing a possible and reliable source mechanism for the generation of 

a seismic event such as the 1755 Great Lisbon Earthquake.  

 

 

7.4. An evolution model for the Gulf of Cadiz 

region 

 

7.4.1. The formation of the Gibraltar Arc 
 

The area that presently corresponds to the Gulf of Cadiz (the foreland of the 

Gibraltar Arc) was initially formed during the Mesozoic as part of the more occidental 

Alpine-Tethys rift system (Fig. 7.5A), which comprised an oceanic domain separating 

two newly formed passive margins. (Dercourt et al., 1986; Sanz de Galdeano, 1990; 

Srivastava et al, 1990a,b; Maldonado et al., 1999; Rosenbaum et al., 2002; Stampli et 

al., 2002). At this stage, a continuous corridor of oceanic lithosphere probably existed 

connecting the Alpine-Tethys to the Atlantic Ocean.  



133 

 

In the Eocene-Oligocene, Africa and Eurasia were already converging (Fig. 

7.5B). This convergence started in the Upper Cretaceous and led to the reactivation of 

most of the Gulf of Cadiz Mesozoic extensional structures (e.g. previous transform and 

rifted-related normal faults; Duarte et al., 2009; Terrinha et al., 2009). The North-South 

convergence was accommodated by the northwards subduction of the Alpine-Tethys 

oceanic lithosphere that extended from the SE Iberia to the western Alps (see Fig. 7.5B; 

Rehault et al., 1985; Malinverno and Ryan, 1986; Dewey et al., 1989; Rosenbaum et al., 

2002; Jolivet et al., 2006). Since the Oligocene, the continental collision in the Alps 

absorbed the bulk compression implied in the convergence of both plates and, as 

consequence, the northwards Apline-Tethys subduction along Europe‘s meridional 

margin slowed down and became primarily driven by the density collapse of the 

subducting oceanic slab (op.cit). This, triggered slab roll-back, which led to the 

formation of the West Mediterranean back-arc basins and associated continental 

terranes, among which Sardinia, Corsica, Calabria and Alboran (Fig. 7.5C; Rosenbaum 

et al., 2002; 2004). In the Middle Miocene, the Alboran terrane was migrating almost 

unimpeded in direction of the Atlantic Ocean. Note that if Africa and Iberia were not 

converging the Gibraltar Arc could have ?invaded? the Atlantic Ocean, propagating in a 

similar manner to what is presently occurring in the Scotia and Lesser Antilles arcs. 

However, the continued convergence between Africa and Eurasia caused the narrowing 

of the East-West oceanic corridor existing between Africa and Iberia (see Fig. 7.5C) and 

led to the collision of the Alboran terrane with the SE Iberia and NW Africa forming the 

Gibraltar (or Betic-Rif) Arc.  

In the Tortonian, the Gibraltar Arc was still migrating westwards, at the same 

time as the accretionary wedge was forming synthetically with the associated eastwards 

subduction of the Tethyan slab beneath Gibraltar (Fig. 7.5D; Lonergan and White, 

1997; Gutscher et al., 2002). At the Present day the Alboran block is nearly trapped 

between Nubia and Iberia, and the subducted slab could have been partially 

delaminated. It is however debatable if there is in the Gulf of Cadiz enough oceanic 

lithosphere, attached to the slab, available to be subducted by roll-back (driven by slab-

pull). On the other hand, even though the subduction may be nearly locked, the N-S 

component of convergence between Africa and Eurasia may also contribute to some 

degree of lateral expulsion of the Alboran block (and the Gibraltar Arc). This could be 

also contributing to the outward propagation of the accretionary wedge to the west even 



134 

 

in the absence of major activity along the subduction plane. Such lateral expulsion, 

together with the counter-clockwise rotation of the Nubia-Iberia convergence direction 

since the Miocene (see Fig. 7.5), may be causing the concentration of stress in the 

Southwest Iberia Margin triggering the activity of the structures present there, since the 

cratonic Iberia would behave essentially as an undeformable rigid block (see Fig. 7.5D).

135 

 

7.4.2. The present-day tectonic driving mechanisms 

 

Two main tectonic driving mechanisms can be envisaged as accounting for the 

present-day active structures in the Gulf of Cadiz: i) the WNW-ESE convergence 

between Nubia and Iberia (see Figs. 7.3 and 7.5A; Nocquet and Calais, 2004; Stich et 

al., 2006; Fernandes et al., 2007; Tahayt et al., 2008; Duarte et al., submitted) and ii) the 

westward movement of the Gibraltar Arc (Gutscher et al., 2002; Tahayt et al., 2008; 

Duarte et al., submitted). 

The first driving mechanism is a consequence of the overall convergence 

between Africa and Eurasia. In the Gulf of Cadiz this convergence is almost 

perpendicular to the NE-SW striking thrust system and sub-parallel to the WNW-ESE 

striking SWIM system (see Fig. 7.5D). These two tectonic systems are thought to 

accommodate this convergence within a general overall scenario of strain partitioning, 

in which the NE-SW striking structures accommodate the thrusting/shortening 

component and the more WNW-ESE striking structures (including the SWIM faults)  

accommodate the dextral strike-slip movement (Terrinha et al., 2009). 

The second driving mechanism has its origin in the westward roll-back implied 

by the eastward Gibraltar subducting slab that has led to the emplacement of the 

accretionary wedge in the Gulf of Cadiz since the Miocene. Evidence of blind-thrusting 

to the West of the accretionary wedge front (see Fig. 7.4; Duarte et al., 2010), suggests 

that this system westwards propagation is still presently ongoing.  

This interpretation, according to which both driving mechanisms are active, is 

supported by GPS data that show, not only a WNW-ESE ~4 mm.yr
-1 

convergence 

between Nubia and Iberia, but also 3.5 mm.yr
-1

 of oblique westward movement of the 

Gibraltar Arc in relation to Iberia (Stich et al., 2006; Tahayt et al., 2008). One major 

question remaining is whether the seismogenic zone of the Gibraltar subduction system 

is locked, even if the Gibraltar Arc is still moving westwards. If this is the case, to what 

extent is this movement being accommodated to the west of the accretionary wedge 

forcing the activation of the Southwest Iberia Margin thrust system? Is the Gibraltar 

subduction ?trapped? and slowing down, while the stress is transmitted to the West 

Iberia Margin thus eventually favoring the formation of a new subduction zone?  



136 

 

7.4.3. The future of the NE Atlantic Gulf of Cadiz region: 

subduction propagation or induced subduction initiation?  

 

At the present state of the knowledge it is difficult to quantify the specific 

contribution of each of the two main driving mechanisms (WNW-ESE convergence 

between Iberia and Núbia, and westward migration of the Gibraltar Arc) that best 

comply with the evolving active tectonic framework in the study area. Further 

numerical modeling could provide significant insight on this matter. Nevertheless, it is 

possible to speculate on the evolution scenarios that can be tested in the future, both 

through modeling and enhanced new observations provided by new geophysical 

surveys. Two plausible evolution scenarios that can be foreseen as two competing end 

members are proposed and discuss:  

i) Subduction propagation - The first scenario considers the westward roll-back 

of the Gibraltar subduction as the main tectonic driving mechanism acting in the Gulf of 

Cadiz region (see Fig. 7.6A). Accordingly, the subduction could hypothetically continue 

to retreat and propagate westwards to Atlantic domain (see Fig. 7.6B-Alternative I). 

However, even though there apparent evidences of the westward propagation of the 

GCAW, the rate of migration of the Alboran Block/Gibraltar Arc seems to be 

decreasing. It is possible that such a decrease is being primarily caused by the N-S 

constriction imposed by the Africa-Iberia convergence, which may also be causing the 

delamination of the subducting slab. Other mechanisms such as the approximation of 

highly buoyant serpentinized basements highs (Gorringe Bank and Coral Patch 

Seamount; see Fig. 7.3) could also inhibit the bending of the lithosphere that together 

with the entrance of ridges (such as the Coral Patch Ridge; see location Fig. 7.3) in the 

subduction plane could contribute to the decrease in the subduction rate or even cause 

its total blocking. In this scenario, even if the subduction succeeds to propagate further 

west into the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain domain, it will be hardly feasible to subduct the 

more than 4 km high Gorringe Bank and Coral Patch Seamount. 

ii) Induced subduction initiation - The second scenario considers the Gibraltar 

Arc subduction system decreasing in activity (until it becomes completely inactive) and 

the Southwest Portuguese Margin as being reactivated, leading to the formation of a 

new incipient subduction zone (see Fig. 7.5B-Alternative II). If this was the case it 



137 

 

would be important to clarify, and if possible to quantify, what is the main mechanism 

driving the reactivation of the margin: the westward movement of the Gibraltar Arc? 

The WNW-ESE convergence between Nubia and Eurasia? Or both? It would be also 

crucial to quantify the magnitude of the forces involved in this process, with the 

objective of trying to understand if they are sufficiently high to overcome lithospheric 

strength and to produce large scale bending of the lithosphere, which is required for 

subduction initiation. 

Even though there are uncertainties on the role of the driving mechanisms 

operating in this region, it seems clear that a new convergent system is developing in the 

Gulf of Cadiz. The formation of this system seems to have been induced by the 

proximity of the Mediterranean orogenic arcs (see Fig. 7.1). This hypothesis is in 

agreement with the Muller and Philips (1991) ideas that passive margins in the 

proximity of mature subduction systems are favorable sites for trench formation. This 

type of passive margin induced reactivation (by stress transference) may be seen as a 

way to initiate a new subduction zone in a passive margin. Thus, the connection 

between pristine oceans to ?infected? oceans with active subduction zones, or the 

existence of narrow landmasses in between, may have a crucial role in plate tectonic. In 

particular, in the beginning of the closing phase of the Wilson Cycle.

139 

 

7.5. Conclusions 

 

In this work it was tentatively addressed the problematic of the role of orogenic 

arcs in the initiation of subduction at passive margins, using the Gibraltar Arc and the 

Southwest Iberia Margin as case studies. To do so, it was analyzed an updated tectonic 

map of the Gulf of Cadiz area (the foreland of the Gibraltar Arc). Our analysis showed 

that at the Present day there are two tectonic driving mechanisms operating in the Gulf 

of Cadiz region: the westwards migration of the Gibraltar Arc and the local WNW-ESE 

convergence between Nubia and Iberia. The Gibraltar Arc and the GCAW are part of a 

subduction system that originated in the Western Mediterranean and seems to be 

propagating to Atlantic domain, however at a significant lower rate than in the Miocene. 

On the other hand, the westward movement of the Gibraltar Arc, together with the 

Present day Nubia-Iberia convergence, seems to be forcing/inducing the reactivation of 

the Southwest Iberia Margin and the formation of a new incipient subduction zone. 

According to this scenario, the Gulf of Cadiz may be seen as a place where a pre-

existent subduction system is ?infecting? the Atlantic. Together with the Scotia and the 

Lesser Antilles arcs, the Gibraltar Arc foreland may represent part of the nucleation 

locus of a new subduction system that might ultimately lead to the closing of the 

Atlantic Ocean.

Chapter 8 
Synthesis and conclusions 

 

In this chapter, the major out puts of the several subjects studied in this thesis are 

presented, outlining the main attained conclusions. Suggestions for further work are also 

presented in the end of the chapter.  

 

 

The Gulf of Cadiz tectonic structures 

 

? A new tectonic map of the Gulf of Cadiz was produced using the coupled 

analysis of a multi-survey MCS dataset and the recently compiled high resolution 

SWIM bathymetry. The map depicts three main tectonic systems: i) the subduction-

related Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge (CGAW), materialized on the seafloor by a 

west dipping U-shaped surface, which is the morphological expression of an eastward 

thickening pile of westwards thrusted sediments; ii) a set of WNW-ESE striking dextral 

strike-slip faults (the SWIM fault system), extending from the eastern part of the Gulf of 

Cadiz to the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain; iii) and a group of NE-SW striking northwest-

directed thrusts located in the Southwest Iberia Margin (the NE-SW thrust system), 

comprising mainly the Horseshoe fault, the Marquês de Pombal fault, the Tagus 

Abyssal Plain fault and the Gorringe northern thrust. Despite these main systems, other 

new structures were recognized, such as the ?corner faults? connecting the SWIM 

wrench system to the Horseshoe thrust fault, the thrusts located in the Horseshoe Valley 

region to which the crescentic depression are associated, and the NE-SW striking Cadiz 

fault, a major dextral strike-slip fault located in the northeastern part of the Gulf of 

Cadiz. 

 

 



142 

 

The crescentic depressions and the GCAW propagation 

 

? The morphotectonic mapping of the Gulf of Cadiz revealed a group of 

kilometric crescentic depressions lying at depths between -4300 m and -4700 m. The 

detailed morphotectonic analysis of these features showed that they were formed due to 

the existence of specific time-recurrent interaction between: a) regional active thrusting 

on top of which most crescentic depressions are carved; and b) tectonically induced 

scouring comprising localized erosion and simultaneous progradational sedimentation, 

produced by downslope currents of probable turbiditic origin. The thrusts on top which 

the crescentic depressions are carved are active (mainly blind) thrust faults that root in 

the GCAW décollement layer to the west of its morphological deformation front. The 

crescentic depressions are interpreted to correspond to the morphological expression of 

the westward propagation of the deformation from the realm of the accretionary wedge 

(GCAW). 

 

 

Thrust-wrench tectonic interference  

 

1. SWIM-1 vs. Horseshoe Fault 

 

? Detail mapping in the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain revealed the existence of a new 

morphotectonic pattern near the intersection (corner zone) of the SWIM-1 fault and the 

Horseshoe fault. Based on combined analog and numerical experiments this pattern was 

interpreted as resulting from the (thrust-wrench) tectonic interference between two of 

the main tectonic systems recognized in the Gulf of Cadiz area: the SWIM faults and 

the NE-SW thrusts.  

 

 

 



143 

 

2. SWIM faults vs. GCAW frontal thrusts 

 

? Detailed morphotectonic analysis showed that there are no apparent crosscutting 

relationships between the SWIM faults and the GCAW. Physical modeling on the 

interference between an accretionary wedge and a strike-slip fault showed that the 

observed morphotectonic pattern of the frontal GCAW area is compatible with: 

 

i) The development of the GCAW on top of inactive, previously formed, 

basement faults (Present day SWIM fault system). 

 

ii) The simultaneously (alternating) activity of the GCAW thrusting with the 

activity of the SWIM-related dextral strike-slip faults. 

 

? The comparison of the obtained experimental results with the natural example 

unambiguously excludes the possibility of active strike-slip faulting (SWIM system) 

affecting an inactive preexistent GCAW, implying that if the SWIM fault system is 

active then the GCAW must also be presently active.  

 

? Tectonic implications of the experiments on the tectonic interference between 

the GCAW and the SWIM faults comprise: 

 

i) The formation of the GCAW on top of preexistent Tethyan rift-related 

faults (from Middle Miocene to ~1.8 Ma);  

 

ii) Strike-slip reactivation of these faults (SWIM system) simultaneously 

with decreasing GCAW activity (~1.8 Ma to Present), as a function of 

counterclockwise rotation of the Iberia-Nubia convergence direction. 

 



144 

 

? The analog modeling experiments together with the geological observations 

favor the interpretation of the SWIM faults as corresponding to the strike-slip 

reactivation of pre-existent basement normal faults.  

 

? The SWIM fault system is interpreted to correspond to the local reactivation of 

the old Tethyan plate boundary, instead of the expression of the onset of a new 

transcurrent plate boundary as argued by Zitellini et al. (2009). 

 

 

 

The Gulf of Cadiz tectonic driving mechanisms  

 

? There are at the Present two driving mechanisms operating in the Gulf of Cadiz 

region:  

 

i)  The local WNW-ESE oblique convergence between Nubia and Iberia;  

 

ii) The westward overthrusting of the Gibraltar Arc. 

 

? The convergence of Nubia with respect to Iberia generates strain partitioning by 

means of dextral wrenching on the WNW–ESE striking steep faults (including the 

SWIM faults) and thrusting on the NE–SW striking thrust faults.  

 

? The westward directed thrusting seems to be propagating from the realm of the 

Gibraltar Arc to the west (Horseshoe fault) and to the north along the Portuguese margin 

(Marquês de Pombal fault, Gorringe northern thrust and Tagus Abyssal Plain fault). 

 

 



145 

 

Westward Gibraltar subduction propagation or induced subduction 

initiation at the Southwest Iberia Margin? 

 

? The Gibraltar Arc and the GCAW are part of a subduction system that originated 

in the Western Mediterranean. The detailed study on the crescentic depressions revealed 

that the deformation related with the GCAW is still propagating westwards, however at 

a slower rate than in Miocene, in agreement to what was suggested by Gutscher et al. 

(2009a). It is speculated that this deceleration is primarily caused by the constraining of 

the Alboran block between the converging Iberia and Nubia.  

 

? The westward movement of the Gibraltar Arc and the GCAW, together with the 

Present day WNW-ESE local Nubia-Iberia convergence, may be forcing/inducing the 

reactivation (in compression) of the Southwest Iberia Margin.  This reactivation is 

materialized by the presence of a set of NE-SW striking major thrust faults (Horseshoe 

fault, Marquês de Pombal fault, Gorringe northern thrust and Tagus Abyssal Plain 

fault). The SWIM strike-slip faults may be acting as transfer zones connecting the two 

main compressive systems (the Gibraltar Arc/GCAW and the Southwest Iberia NE-SW 

thrusts).  

 

? A scenario in which the Gibraltar Arc subduction and GCAW is decreasing in 

activity, at the same time that an incipient subduction zone is nucleating in the 

Southwest Iberia Margin, is favored, in agreement to what was previously proposed by 

Ribeiro et al. (1996). The Gulf of Cadiz may be thus seen as a place where the 

proximity of a pre-existent subduction system is ?infecting? the Atlantic, in a 

comparable manner to what happen in the Scotia and in the Lesser Antilles arcs, 

however in an earlier stage of the process. Contrary to these two arcs, in the Gulf of 

Cadiz the new potential subduction system seems to be propagating laterally along the 

adjacent Portuguese Margin.  

 

? Finally, this work supports the speculation that the Gulf of Cadiz (Ribeiro et al., 

1996), together with Scotia and the Lesser Antilles arcs (Mueller and Phillips, 1991), 

may correspond to the precursors of a subduction system that will ultimately lead to the 

closing of the Atlantic Ocean.  



146 

 

Suggestions for future work 

 

? Perform a systematic MCS and high resolution seismic reflection survey (and 

subsequent detailed tectonic cartography) in the area where the NE-SW thrusts are 

located. It would be important to understand if these structures are connected by lateral 

ramps or if they root in a common structural level. This possibility could also be tested 

using sand-box analog modeling and numerical modeling. 

 

? Carry out a systematic seismic refraction survey at the scale of the whole Gulf of 

Cadiz, collecting several orthogonal profiles. This would be important to obtain a good 

3D rheological structure of the lithosphere. In particular, it would allow recognizing the 

nature and limits of the existing types of oceanic lithosphere, such as the Tethyan and 

the Atlantic (both Nubian and Iberian). 

 

? Test the Gulf of Cadiz tectonic evolution models using 3D numerical modeling 

with the main objective of quantifying the contribution of each driving mechanisms 

acting in the Gulf of Cadiz to the observed deformation pattern.  

 

 

? Finally, collect cores and obtain a good coverage of high resolution seismic 

profiles in the area where the crescentic depressions are located. A more detailed study 

would allow a better understanding of the processes that lead to the formation of these 

features. Also, if the crescentic depressions are controlled by tectonic activity, a detailed 

tectono-stratigraphic study of the existing buried features could provide constrains in 

the timing of recent tectonic events.

Abstract: Recent mapping of the Gulf of Cadiz seafloor permitted to identify major tectonic linea-
ments: the SWIM lineaments (Zitellini et al., 2009) and Cadiz lineament, striking WNW-ESE and
NE-SW, respectively. Multibeam swath bathymetry and interpretation of multi-channel seismic data
indicate that these features can be interpreted to correspond to the seafloor morphological expression
of active dextral strike-slip faults. Based on the interpreted data and recently published GPS plate kine-
matic velocity vectors of Nubia with respect to Iberia and the Alboran block (e.g. Fernandes et al.; 2003
Stich et al., 2006) we propose that the SWIM Faults are related to the general NW-SE convergence of
Nubia with respect to Iberia, and the Cadiz fault is related to the westward movement of the Gibraltar
orogenic arc.

The Gulf of Cadiz is located in a complex tectonic area,
encompassing the controversial SW Eurasia-NW Africa
plate boundary (see figure 1). Some authors believe that
this is a diffuse plate boundary (Sartori et al., 1994;
Medialdea et al., 2004), other describe an active subduc-
tion with roll-back of a subducted slab (Gutscher et al.,
2002), while others postulate a prolongation of a trans-
pressive deformation belt from the Rif-Tell (Morel and
Meghraouie, 1996; Zitellini et al., 2009). This region
experiences a general NW-SE to WNW-ESE convergence
between Nubia and Eurasia at a rate of 5-6 mm a-1 (Calais

et al., 2003). Stich et al. (2006) proposed that the SW
Iberian Margin is also accommodating a 3.5 mm a-1 of
westward motion of the Gibraltar arc relative to intraplate
Iberia. Seismicity is distributed over a more than 400 km
wide zone between the Gibraltar arc and the Horseshoe
fault (Fig. 1) and earthquakes are characterized by magni-
tudes usually smaller than 5.5. In the western part of the
Gulf of Cadiz, in the area that encompasses the
Horseshoe fault until the eastern part of the Gloria fault,
seismicity is distributed over a narrower area and instru-
mental seismicity is higher, with recent events of M=6

and the 1969 event of M=7.9 (Fukao, 1973; Stich et al.,
2006). Zitellini et al. (2004) described a number of active
structures scattered along the Gulf of Cadiz and SW
Portugal showing that tectonic strain is presently accom-
modated between 35.5º N and 38º N (approximately
250 km), which suggests a diffuse strain distribution of
the plate convergence.

Over the last two decades a large amount of geological
and geophysical data have been collected aiming at iden-
tifying the main tectonic features present in the Gulf of
Cadiz and to clarify how deformation has been accom-
modated during Alpine to present times (Zitellini et al.,
2009). In this work we describe the morphology and
structure of WNW-ESE and one NE-SW trending linea-
ments recently mapped in the Gulf of Cadiz region and
discuss their tectonic significance.

This work is extracted from a much larger study based
on the analysis and interpretation of 180,000 km2 of
multibeam swath bathymetry and reflectivity

(backscatter) data of the Gulf of Cadiz area and more
than 20,700 km multi-channel seismic profiles. This
dataset was collected throughout several surveys car-
ried out by international teams of several countries
and compiled for the ESF Eurocores EuroMargins
SWIM project (Earthquake and Tsunami hazards of
active faults at the South-West Iberian Margin: deep
structure, high-resolution imaging and paleo-seismic
signature, REN2002-11234-EMAR, 01-LEC-
EMA09 F) (http://www.swim.ul.pt/index_topo.htm)

The SWIM lineaments

Morphology

The SWIM lineaments are linear features that strike
approximately WNW-ESE and extend from the east-

try). Topography of onshore area is also shown as shaded relief. Dashed lines represent the main tectonic lineaments studied in this

ernmost part of the Gulf of Cadiz accretionary wedge
until the Horseshoe abyssal plain, south of the
Gorringe submarine mountain (Fig. 1). They cut across
various morphological domains, contain various active
mud volcanoes along their path and offset the NE-SW
Horseshoe fault scarp (Fig.2), an active reverse fault
(Gràcia et al., 2003; Zitellini et al., 2004). These linear
features correspond to the alignment of elongated
crests and troughs on the sea floor with wavelengths of
the order of tens of kilometers. According to Zitellini et
al. (2009), the longest of the SWIM lineaments,
SWIM 1, exceeds 600 km, and it can be followed from
the Gorringe bank southern flank to the Morocco shelf
and corresponds to a strike-slip fault. In some segments
of this lineament it is possible to identify E-W-striking
undulations with maximum lengths of about 8 km
(Fig. 2). These features show an en echelon pattern that
corresponds to oriented folds of the recent sedimenta-
ry cover, allowing us to establish a dextral strike-slip
movement. The width of each individual SWIM linea-
ment is only of a few hundreds of meters.

Structure

The interpretation of a segment of a profile across
SWIM 2 lineament (Fig. 3a) shows that it corre-
sponds to a fault that cuts through Mesozoic sedi-
ments (Unit A) (Tortella et al., 1997). This fault
formed during the Mesozoic rifting as a normal fault.
This assumption is corroborated by the presence of a
syn-rift growth wedge (Unit B). The SWIM 2 fault
was later reactivated with a southwards reverse move-

ment because the wedge (Unit B) is over-thrusted
towards the SW. This reactivation probably occurred
during Paleogene to Miocene times (Rosas et al., in
press; Terrinha et al., 2009). This movement seems to
be coeval with the installation of the Accretionary
wedge (Unit D) since it clearly tapers towards the
eastern part of the profile. The SWIM fault also
deforms and folds the Plio-Quaternary unit (Unit E)
and cuts through the seafloor. 

The Cadiz lineament

Morphology

The morphology of the Cadiz lineament is more
complex than that of the SWIM 2 lineament. It is
relatively diffuse and occupies a broader area, with
widths varying from several hundreds of meters to a
few kilometers. It strikes approximately NE-SW and
extends for about 200 km from the northeastern
Gulf of Cadiz continental shelf to the westernmost

part of the accretionary wedge (Fig.1). The lineament
is slightly curved towards the west at the south-west-
ern part where it meets the SWIM 1 fault (Fig. 1). It
is materialized on the seafloor by the alignment of
several different features such as crests, scarps, chan-
nels and diapiric ridges (Somoza et al., 2003). The
Cadiz lineament is more prominent in its northeast-
ern segment, where it is adjacent to the Guadalquivir
bank (a basement high with active seismicity) and it
loses morphological expression progressively towards

the SW, where it intercepts the SWIM 2 lineament
and is almost untraceable in the surroundings of the
SWIM 1 lineament.

Structure

A segment of IAM GC3 seismic profile (Fig. 3b) across
the Cadiz lineament shows that it seats on top of a fault
zone. This fault is parallel to the deep blind thrust of
the Guadalquivir bank towards the SE, as interpreted
in figure 3 (Unit A). This movement is corroborated by
the gentle folding of the reflectors of Unit A. It is also
possible to observe a thin-skinned fault accommodat-
ing the over-thrusting of the accretionary wedge
described by Gutscher et al. (2002) towards NE over
the Guadalquivir basement (Unit D). This unit corre-
sponds to imbrications of NNW-verging thrusts, as
shown by the planar fabric of the acoustic facies. Near
the surface the more continuous cover sediments are
clearly folded; however, they do not show evidences of
major vertical displacement (Unit E).

Discussion 

Based on bathymetric and structural observations we
interpret the SWIM lineaments as the morphological
expression of dextral WNW-ESE trending strike-slip
faults rooted in the Mesozoic rift basin. This interpre-
tation is derived from both observed coherent en ech-
elon folding pattern on the seafloor associated with the

faults and the minor vertical displacement of the post-
Miocene cover. This assumption is in agreement with
recent work by Zitellini et al. (2009) and Terrinha et
al. (2009) that describes in detail the kinematic indi-
cators and the age of these faults. Rosas et al. (2009),
using analogue models and the en echelon folds has
markers for a quantitative strain analysis, suggested
that the SWIM lineaments initiated their strike-slip
movement 1.8 Ma ago, at least. This interpretation is
also in agreement with the general NW-SE to WNW-
ESE convergence between Africa and Eurasia at a rate
of 5-6 mm a-1 and the fact that the SWIM faults off-
set the Late Miocene movement of the Horseshoe
Fault. In this way, the SWIM lineaments can be
accommodating a strike-slip component of this con-
vergence, while the main shortening is being accom-
modated in the northwestwards directed thrusts of the
SW Iberian Margin, for example the Horseshoe fault. 

The Cadiz lineament has a strong morphological
expression, mainly in its northeastern part where salt
diapirs have extruded (Somoza et al., 2003). However,
no kinematic indicators could clearly be detected in
our analysis. It corresponds to an almost vertical fault
that deforms the sedimentary cover with no major ver-
tical displacement. Based on recent data published by
Stich et al. (2006), that reported a 3.5 mm a-1 of west-
ward motion of the Gibraltar arc relative to intra-plate
Iberia, we propose that the Cadiz lineament is a major
dextral strike-slip fault zone that is accommodating this

Figure 3. (a) Multi-channel seismic reflection profiles IAM GC2, and (b) IAM GC3. The white dashed lines mark the fault zones cor-
responding to the lineaments (SWIM 2 on the left and the Cadiz Lineament on the right). The profile a) shows two previous vertical
movements of the SWIM fault (white arrows). On profile b) the following features are pointed out, reverse fault of the Guadalquivir
basement to the SSE; and a thin-skinned fault of accommodating the over-thrusting movement of the Accretionary wedge over the
Guadalquivir basement. A: Basement; B: Sin-rift wedge (Mesozoic age); C: Post-rift unit; D: Accretionary Wedge unit (Miocene age);
E: Cover unit (Plio-Quaternary age).

relative motion in the Gulf of Cadiz area. The lack of
good strike-slip kinematic indicators in this part of the
study area is probably due to the higher rate of recent
sedimentation associated with the proximal parts of the
Mediterranean Outflow Water and discharge of the
Guadalquivir river as well as the extrusion of fluidized
material along diapiric ridges (Somoza et al. 2003), as
well as to the pure shortening at the front of the
Guadalquivir bank thrust, as argued in this work.

Conclusions

In this work we studied various major tectonic linea-
ments localized in the Gulf of Cadiz area. We showed
that they correspond to major transpressive dextral
strike-slip faults with two different orientations: the

WNW-ESE SWIM faults and the NE-SW Cadiz
fault. Both faults are active and are probably related
with two different driving mechanisms. The SWIM
faults are related to the general WNW-ESE conver-
gence between Nubia and Eurasia and the Cadiz fault
is related to the westward expulsion of the Gibraltar
Arc relative to Iberia, possibly associated with the
convergence between the two lithospheric plates.

The Gulf of Cadiz, off SW Iberia and the NW Moroccan margin, straddles the cryptic plate boundary between
Africa and Eurasia, a region where the orogenic Alpine compressive deformation in the continental collision
zone passes laterally to the west to strike-slip deformation. A set of new multibeam bathymetry, multi-
channel and single-channel seismic data presented here image the main morphological features of tectonic
origin of a significant part of the Gulf of Cadiz from the continental shelf to the abyssal plain. These
morphotectonic features are shown to result from the reactivation of deeply rooted faults that changed their
kinematics from the early Mesozoic rifting, through the Late Cretaceous–Paleogene collision, to the Pliocene–
Quaternary thrusting and wrenching. The old faults control deep incised, more than 100 km long canyons
and valleys. Several effects of neotectonics on deep water seabed are shown. These include: i) the complex
morphology caused by wrenching on the 230 km long WNW–ESE faults that produced en echelon folds on
the sediments; ii) the formation of up to 5 km wide crescent shaped scours at roughly 4 km water depth by
reactivation of thrusts; iii) 10 km long creep folds on the continental slope; and iv) the formation of
landslides on active fault escarpments. The present day deformation is partitioned on NE–SW thrusts and
WNW–ESE to W–E strike-slip faults and is propagating northwards on N–S trending thrusts along the West
Iberia Margin from 35.5°N to 38°N, which should be considered for seismic hazard.

1. Introduction

1.1. Scope and objectives

In recent years the Gulf of Cadiz (Fig. 1) has been recognized as a
key site to understand a broad spectrum of geological issues, such as:
i) the tectonic evolution of the Africa–Iberia plate boundary, the
formation of the Gibraltar orogenic arc, the earthquake and tsuna-
migenic structures, the origin of the catastrophic 1755 Lisbon earth-
quake and tsunami (Argus et al., 1989; DeMets et al., 1994; Sillard
et al., 1998; Maldonado et al., 1999; Kreemer and Holt, 2001; Zitellini
et al., 2001; Gutscher et al., 2002; Sella et al., 2002; Calais et al., 2002;
Calais et al., 2003; Terrinha et al., 2003; Fernandes et al., 2003; Gràcia
et al., 2003a; Gràcia et al., 2003a,b; Nocquet and Calais, 2004; Medialdea
et al., 2004; Stich et al., 2006), ii) the Mediterranean Outflow Water
(MOW) and its relation to sedimentation and climate changes (Ambar
et al., 2002; Somoza et al., 2003; Mulder et al., 2003; Hernandez-
Molina et al., 2003; Voelker et al., 2006), iii) fluid escape and mud
volcanism (Somoza et al., 2003; Pinheiro et al., 2003; Van Rensbergen
et al., 2005; Pinheiro et al., 2006), and iv) chemosynthetic ecosystems
associated to cold seeps (Niemann et al., 2006).

Behind this diversity of processes affecting the geosphere, the
biosphere and the hydrosphere, is a complex geological evolution of
the area throughout the Neogene. It is now well established, after
various studies based on seismic reflection profiles, sidescan sonar and
ground truthing, that the whole area is under compressive deforma-
tion. A number of active tectonic structures with high tsunamigenic
potential were mapped (Terrinha et al., 2003; Gràcia et al., 2003a,b;
Zitellini et al., 2004) and various multilayered complexes of

hemipelagic-mass wasting deposits of Holocene and Pleistocene age
were imaged and dated (Vizcaino et al., 2006).

The morphology of the northeastern part of the Gulf of Cadiz was
described by Hernandez-Molina et al. (2003), Mulder et al. (2003) and
Somoza et al. (2003). The morphology of the southern part of this
sector is clearly influenced by the tectonomorphic processes associ-
ated with the deformation of the Gulf of Cadiz accretionary wedge
(Maldonado et al., 1999; Gutscher et al., 2002), as well as gravitational
processes (Gutscher et al., 2008), while in the northern part the
shaping processes are sedimentary, erosive and tectonic, associated
with the MOW and to diapiric ridges.

The objective of this work is to describe the morphology of the
northwestern part of the Gulf of Cadiz and discuss the morphogenetic
processes in relation to the tectonic deformation of the Alpine colli-
sion front and the Gloria transform fault. This is done based on the
interpretation of an original multibeam bathymetry data and seismic
reflection profiles.

1.2. Geological setting

During Triassic through Early Cretaceous times the southern and
western Iberian margins underwent tectonic rifting, which led to
oceanic break-up of the West Iberian Margin from Barremian to Aptian
times (Pinheiro et al., 1996). Although the existence of oceanic litho-
sphere in the Gulf of Cadiz is still a matter of debate (Srivastava et al.,
1990; Gràcia et al., 2003a,b; Rovere et al., 2004), some authors
postulated the existence of a south Iberia subduction zone that ac-
commodated the Africa–Iberia convergence, from Late Cretaceous–
Paleogene through Miocene times (e.g. Srivastava et al., 1990). Ac-
cordingly, this process led to the formation of back arc basins and
associated tectonic terranes in the western Mediterranean, the forma-
tion of the Betic orogen, as well as to the tectonic inversion of the
rifted autochthonous south Portuguese and south Spanish margins (e.g.
Terrinha, 1998; Maldonado et al., 1999; Rosenbaum et al., 2002; Lopes
et al., 2006). Westward directed thrusting of the Internal Betics domains
and orogenic collapse, possibly associated with roll back of the Africa
subducted slab, formed the Gibraltar orogenic arc, the Gulf of Cadiz
accretionary wedge and lithospheric thinning in the Alboran Sea
(Rosenbaum et al., 2002; Faccenna et al., 2004). These tectonic processes
led to the formation of an accretionary wedge westward of the Gibraltar
arc (Gutscher et al., 2002) or imbricate wedge with a westward directed
tectonic transport, and an associated distal olistostrome complex (e.g.,
Horseshoe Gravitational Unit in Iribarren et al., 2007; Giant Chaotic
Body in Torelli et al., 1997) that extends across the Horseshoe
Abyssal Plain (Fig. 2). The MCS lines reveal a basal decollement
horizon of the stacked thrusts of the accretionary wedge near the top
of the Cretaceous. Both the accretionary prism and the olistostrome
are sealed by sediments of Late Miocene to Lower Pliocene age
(Tortella et al., 1997; Torelli et al., 1997; Roque, 2007). The segment
of the Azores–Gibraltar Fracture Zone to the east of the Gloria Fault
(inset in Fig. 1) was described by Sartori et al. (1994) as a diffuse
plate tectonic boundary and various plate kinematic models indicate
a 4 mm/yr rate of NW–SE to WNW–ESE convergence between Nubia
and Iberia along this fault (insets in Figs. 1 and 8), (Argus et al., 1989;
DeMets et al., 1994; Sillard et al., 1998; Kreemer and Holt, 2001;
Sella et al., 2002; Calais et al., 2002; Calais et al., 2003; Fernandes et
al., 2003; Nocquet and Calais, 2004; Stich et al., 2006). Ribeiro et al.
(1996) postulated the formation of an incipient West Iberia
subduction zone during Pliocene–Quaternary times, based on the
computed NW–SE present day main compression direction.

N–S to NE–SW faults formed in the Permian during the late
Variscan fracturing event (Arthaud and Matte, 1977; Ribeiro, 2002)
and they were subsequently reactivated during the Mesozoic rifting,

and the Cenozoic through Present compression (Fig. 2, Dias, 2001;
Carrilho et al., 2004).

Offshore, the N–S trending Marquês de Pombal and Pereira de
Sousa faults lie on the north to south trending southernmost segment
of the West Iberian Margin. These faults were described as active in
the Quaternary by Zitellini et al. (1999), Zitellini et al. (2001), Gràcia
et al. (2003a,b) and Terrinha et al. (2003). The uneven surface of the
Marquês de Pombal fault scarp is due to widespread slumping and
landslides with mass transport distances that exceed 20 km. The
Pereira de Sousa fault scarp is also heavily incised and the D. Henrique
basin shows a series of radial ridges that consist of turbidite levees
transported downslope from the highs that surround it (Terrinha
et al., 2003; Gràcia et al., 2003a,b).

WSW–ENE to W–E trending Mesozoic rifting faults were inverted
during the latest Cretaceous through early Miocene times (Terrinha,
1998; Lopes et al., 2006).

Duarte et al. (2005) showed the existence of presently active
WNW–ESE trending faults in the Gulf of Cadiz and Medialdea (2007)
proposed that these faults acted as transfer faults between the
Gorringe Bank and the Marquês de Pombal fault across the
Horseshoe fault. Onshore southwest Portugal, WNW–ESE trending
Lower Jurassic extensional faults were described by Ribeiro and
Terrinha (2007). Zitellini et al. (2009) proposed the existence of a
Nubia–Eurasia plate boundary based on a set of 600 km long WNW–
ESE trending set of strike-slip faults that cut across the Horseshoe
Abyssal Plain and Gulf of Cadiz connecting the Gloria Fault and the
Tell tectonic zone onshore north-west Morocco.
Earthquake frequency and epicentre location (Fig. 2) show that
SW Iberia is an area of moderate seismicity which accommodates the
brittle deformation associated with the Nubia–Iberia collision west of
Gibraltar, by means of thrusting and strike-slip events of shallow and
intermediate depth. However, the existence of historical and instru-
mental high magnitude earthquakes such as the 1/11/1755 Lisbon
earthquake (M=8.5 to 8.9) and the 28/2/1969 (Ms=7.9) event re-
quire clarification of the present tectonic setting of the SW Iberia–NW
Africa region, and identification of the structures that generate large
magnitude earthquakes and tsunami in this area. The Gorringe Bank
Fault is a north westwards directed thrust that sits at the northern
base of this morphologic feature. This thrust uplifted the seafloor from
approximately ?5000 m to ?24 m, it reached its paroxysmal activity
in Miocene times and has accommodated negligible shortening since
then (Sartori et al., 1994; Tortella et al., 1997). Although the Gorringe
Bank is by far the most conspicuous morphotectonic structure in the
study area (Fig. 1), the distribution of seismicity (Fig. 2), numerical
models for tsunami wave propagation (Baptista et al., 1998) and the
interpretation of MCS lines (Sartori et al., 1994), led various re-
searchers to abandon it as the source of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.

Recent models proposed the existence of two faults, the Marquês
de Pombal Fault and the Horseshoe fault (Terrinha et al., 2003; Gràcia
et al., 2003a,b) (Fig. 2) or the Marquês de Pombal Fault and the
Guadalquivir Bank fault (Baptista et al., 2003), acting together
simultaneously to generate the 1755 event by adding up their rupture
areas (Terrinha et al., 2003; Baptista et al., 2003; Gràcia et al., 2003a,b).
Alternatively, Gutscher et al. (2002) proposed that the 1755 Lisbon



159P. Terrinha et al. / Marine Geology 267 (2009) 156–174
earthquake was generated in the Gibraltar subduction zone imaged on
seismic tomography, arguing that this was also the source of the deep
1954 Granada earthquake.

1.3. Data and methods

38,000 km2 of multibeam swath bathymetry data were acquired in
the MATESPRO Survey with a hull-mounted Simrad EM 120 echo-
sounder aboard the research vessel NRP D. Carlos I in 3 legs from 14 June
to 7 July 2004 (Figs. 3 and 4). The survey was carried out in order
to comply with a level 3 hydrographic survey as established by the
International Hydrographic Organization. The EM 120 operates at a
main frequency of 12 kHz (from 11.25 to 12.6 kHz) with 191 beams
covering a 150° fan with a width of 1°. In order to increase data quality
the angular value was reduced to 120° and the ping width was of 2°. One
sound velocity profile (SVP) was performed every 24 h and at locations
chosen to spatially cover the entire area in order to compensate the
effect of the Mediterranean Outflow Water on the sound velocity in the
water column regionally. SVP data were acquired down to 2000 m of
water depth. From ?2000 to ?4000 m sound velocity was taken from
climatologic profiles provided by the Instituto Hidrográfico of Portugal
in this area. Quality control lines were also performed totalizing about
10% of the area; the depth errors found were below 0.3% of the water
depth. Bathymetric data filtering and processing was carried using
CARIS HIPS software and a 100 m grid was generated.

The positioning of the vessel was done with both GPS and DGPS
mounted on different parts of the vessel in order to better deter-
minate the position and make the yaw corrections; the errors asso-
ciated with the navigation positioning were around 5 m.

The seismic data presented here are of two types: multi-channel
seismic (MCS) profiles from three previous surveys, ARRIFANO
(acronym of Arco Rifano; Sartori et al., 1994), IAM (acronym of Iberian
Fig. 3. Map showing the acquisition track lines of the MATESPRO multibeam bathymetry and
of the sound velocity profiles performed. Location of oil prospection wells (stars) is also sh
Atlantic Margin; Banda et al., 1995) and VOLTAIRE (acronym of
Valuation Of Large Tsunamis And Iberian Risk for Earthquakes) and
one single-channel profile acquired during the TTR-14 survey (Training
Through Research; Kenyon et al., 2006).

The IAM and ARRIFANO deep MCS have a similar central peak
frequency of approximately 30 Hz and the VOLTAIRE MCS has a central
peak frequency of approximately 50 Hz. As a result, the vertical reso-
lution in the sedimentary section is of around 20 m for the IAM and
ARRIFANO profiles and of about 15 m for the VOLTAIRE data, assuming a
mean seismic velocity of 2500 ms?1 in the sedimentary section (data
from bore-holes in Fig. 3 and González et al., 1998). The central peak
frequency of the single-channel TTR profile is around 100 Hz with a
corresponding vertical resolution of about 6 m. Information on acquisi-
tion and processing of these profiles is summarized in Table 1.

The presented seismostratigraphic interpretation was based on
the stratigraphy of five industry wells offshore the Algarve Basin
(stars in Fig. 1, Lopes et al., 2006), as well as published data from the
offshore Guadalquivir Basin (Maldonado et al., 1999).

2. Morphology of the NW part of the Gulf of Cadiz

The MATESPRO multibeam dataset (Fig. 4) shows a variety of
seafloor major morphological features within which smaller scale
features indicative of genetic processes discussed elsewhere in this
paper are found.

on the continental slope is of 2 km. This canyon is made up of two
segments oriented NE–SW and N–S that collect the sediment from the
gullies that incise the shelf and slope (Figs. 4 and 5). Also note that
the flanks of the NE–SW trending segment and the eastern flank
of the N–S trending segment display higher degree of incision,
while the western flank of the N–S trending segment and both
flanks of the deepest part of the canyon are smoother. The close up
in Fig. 6A shows a submarine landslide near the termination of the
canyon. The lack of the mass transport deposit within the canyon is
an indication of the activity of the canyon in terms of sediment
erosion and transport.

The 70 km long Portimão canyon also has its head scarp in the
shelf at roughly 70 mbsl. The canyon cuts across the shelf and slope
sedimentary sequence with a maximum incision of 1 km. The canyon
terminates abruptly at the meeting point with the Faro canyon and D.
Carlos valley that drain east to west. These features have a different
physiography, with a flat and broad bottom capable of accommodat-
ing larger sediment influx. The Portimão canyon is fairly rectilinear
and sits along the Portimão Fault (Terrinha et al., 1999).

The Aljezur and Lagos canyons only incise the continental slope.
The NNE–SSW trending Aljezur canyon is short, rectilinear and drains
into the Sagres valley. The western flank of the Aljezur canyon
displays a series of anastomosed submarine slide scars at approxi-
mately 1300 mbsl, at a main morphologic break of the continental
slope near the base of the Lagos contourite drift (Fig. 6B).

The Sagres valley collects the east to west draining D. Carlos and
Cadiz valleys and the Aljezur and Lagos canyons. The Aljezur canyon
and Sagres valley lie on the southern prolongation of an important
slope break that can be observed in the low resolution bathymetry
(see Figs. 2, 4 and 5) and also on the southern continuation of the
Aljezur Fault that cuts across the Meso–Cenozoic Algarve Basin and
Paleozoic basement (Fig. 2).
Fig. 5. Interpretative sketch of the morphology of the study area
The Lagos canyon has its head scarp roughly at 800 mbsl, where it
incises the Pliocene through Holocene Lagos contourite drift.

2.1.2. East to west oriented sediment drainage system
The seafloor of the inner part of the Gulf of Cadiz dips to the west

towards the Atlantic Ocean. The seafloor is shaped by a variety of
morphological features of various scales, many of which have been
described by Mulder et al. (2003), Somoza et al. (2003), Hernandez-
Molina et al. (2006), and Gutscher et al. (2008).

The most important E–W trending valleys of the study area lie in the
prolongation of the sinuous and broader E–W channels that initiate on
the Gibraltar Arc owing to erosion and sedimentation by the MOW and
to downslope gravity processes (Hernandez-Molina et al., 2003). In the
study area these valleys are broad, with flat gently dipping bottom.
The Faro canyon and D. Carlos valley collect the sediment transport from
the South Portuguese margins, a large number of gullies, valleys and the
Portimão canyon. The D. Carlos valley changes from narrow channel to
broad valley downslope from the merge of the Portimão Canyon.

The Cadiz valley lies between the Portimão Bank and the wrinkled
surface of the Gulf of Cadiz accretionary wedge. The Sagres valley that
lies in the prolongation of the Aljezur canyon establishes the connection
between the drainage system located to the east of the Horseshoe Fault
scarp and the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain. The Sagres valley displays a
corrugate bottom north of the confluence with the Cadiz valley; from
this point to the south it has a smooth surface and less dip. The flanks of
the Sagres valley display various evidences of gravity slumping (Fig. 6B).

The Horseshoe valley is a roughly rectangular area, 80 km×50 km,
dipping to the west (mean dip of ~0.5°), connecting the Gulf of Cadiz
seafloorandthe HorseshoeAbyssalPlainacross theHorseshoe Faultscarp
(Fig. 1). The valley is limited by the Sagres plateau in the north, the Coral
Patch Ridge in the south and the Gulf of Cadiz accretionary wedge in
the east. It is cross cut by WNW–ESE trending morphological lineaments

described elsewhere in this paper. This wide valley collects the mouths of
well developed canyons and valleys that drain the sediments from the
north and eastern shelves. The drainage to the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain is
poorly developed (Fig. 5) and the Horseshoe fault scarp is being eroded in
various segments showing evidences of landsliding (Fig. 6C). These
different styles and degrees of maturation of the sediment drainage
pattern suggest that this area acts simultaneously as a by-pass and
receptacle region for the sediments that are carried from the continental
shelves to the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain.

Despite the general low slope of this area, there are NE–SW trend-
ing scarps with a maximum height of approximately 150 m (Fig. 7).
The flat areas have maximum dips of 3° and slope breaks in which
formed convex upwards crescent shaped escarpments. The crescent
shaped three-dimensional features measure up to 5 km across, are
shown in detail in Fig. 7 to occur between 3900 and 4700 mbsl, have an
internal escarpment up to ~100 m high with an internal slope varying
from 6° to 27°.

2.2. Plateaus and escarpments

The plateaus in the study area are the Marquês de Pombal, Sagres
and Portimão plateaus (Figs. 1, 4 and 5). The Marquês de Pombal



Fig. 7. Shaded relief image (perspective view) of the Giant Scours (GS), L1 and L2 WNW–ESE trending lineaments (interpreted as strike-slip faults, max. total length 250 km, see

Figs. 1 and 4. Position of seismic lines in Figs. 11, 15 and 16 is also shown. Detail of the en echelon folds on L1 in the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain is shown in Fig. 6E.

163P. Terrinha et al. / Marine Geology 267 (2009) 156–174
plateau is a roughly rectangular surface bound by the NNE–SSW
trending Marquês de Pombal reverse fault scarp in the west and by the
São Vicente canyon in the east, as described by Gràcia et al. (2003a,b).

The Sagres plateau has an approximately rectangular shape
divided by a diagonal NE–SW trending crest. To the west, the Sagres
plateau is bound by the Horseshoe reverse fault scarp and the São
Vicente canyon and by the Aljezur canyon and the Sagres Valley in the
east. In the north this plateau is separated from the mid and upper
continental slope and shelf by a rectilinear E–W trending valley that
lies in the prolongation of the D. Carlos valley.

The Horseshoe fault scarp is only well developed on its northern
segment. The southern part is being eroded (Fig. 6C) by the sediment
drainage system described previously.

The southern part of the Sagres plateau dips gently towards the
Horseshoe valley. This surface dips approximately 1.5°, is very uneven,
and has a wavy appearance comprising undulations that vary from
hundreds of meters to more than 10 km in length, and 0.5 km to 5 km
across (Figs. 4 and 5).

The Portimão plateau is an E–W elongated surface limited by the
two prominent escarpments which constitute flanks of the D. Carlos
and Cadiz valleys. The northern escarpment is sinuous, while the
southern one, is fairly rectilinear, trending WNW–ESE, draped by
recent sediments carried by the local drainage. The top of this plateau
shows circular positive reliefs, the larger one of which has been
labeled here as the D. Carlos salt diapir (Figs. 1, 4 and 6D), whose
origin is discussed elsewhere in this paper.

2.3. The Horseshoe Abyssal Plain

The extremely flat HAP has general slopes of less than 0.1° sharply
contrasting with the slopes of the foot of its boundaries, between 5°
and 10° in general.
The foot of the slope of the Gorringe Bank presents a remarkable
offset of about 14 km at roughly 11°W (Fig. 4). This offset lies at the
end of a valley that originates at the Gorringe saddle (see Fig. 1 for
location). It is also clear that the southern flanks of the Gettysburg and
Ormonde seamounts display fairly different topographic roughness.
The Ormonde southern flank smooth topography resembles the
morphological types of the continental slope or of the Sagres plateau,
while the edges of the Gettysburg and Coral Patch Ridge display a
similar wrinkled surface. It is possible that this offset and valley coin-
cide with the ocean–continent boundary proposed by Rovere et al.
(2004) at the Gorringe Bank.

The interior of the HAP is only locally perturbed by four elongated
groups of hills that rise between 40 m and 200 m above seafloor
(Fig. 4 and 6E). The largest of these groups is 16 km in length and the
largest individual hill is 6 km long. The hills in each group are aligned
along approximately E–W directions and each one of the hills has
their crest parallel to NE–SW, approximately. These hills are aligned
along the WNW–ESE oriented tectonic morphological lineaments
described and discussed elsewhere in this paper.

2.4. Lineaments

Long WNW–ESE trending discrete lineaments of tectonic origin
were for the first time revealed in the Gulf of Cadiz sea floor by the
MATESPRO multibeam survey (Duarte et al., 2005 and Rosas et al.,
2009). These lineaments consist of an aligned series of elongate
WNW–ESE trending crests and troughs, more or less continuous, with
a typical width of a few hundreds of meters (Figs. 4 and 7). Pervasive
sets of E–W linear undulations, up to 8 km long, accompany these
lineaments (Fig. 7). To the east of the Horseshoe escarpment these
lineaments present uninterrupted segments as large as 100 km of
length, approximately, while in the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain these



164 P. Terrinha et al. / Marine Geology 267 (2009) 156–174
lineaments are discontinuous. Altogether, from the Gorringe Bank
flank across the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain and lower continental slope
of the Gulf of Cadiz, lineaments of 250 km can be identified, from
approximately 4870 to 2000 mbsl (Fig. 4). It is worthwhile to note
that various mud volcanoes sit on top of the lineaments (Figs. 2 and 4).

3. Structure of the NW part of the Gulf of Cadiz

A structural map of the study area based on the interpretation of
the MATESPRO bathymetry and available MCS profiles is presented in
Fig. 8. The main faults are here described based on MCS profiles that
are quoted from published works or presented here. Fig. 8 also shows
a compilation of focal mechanisms and main horizontal compression
taken from Ribeiro et al. (1996).

3.1. WNW–ESE to E–W Faults

One of the most prominent features in the north-western part of
the Gulf of Cadiz is the above described WNW–ESE to E–W trending
set of valleys, escarpments and lineaments (Figs. 4 and 7). The seismic
lines that are shown in Figs. 9–11 and hereafter described show that

all these features are associated with faults, whose geometry and
kinematic history are different.

The D. Carlos and Cadiz valleys that bound the Portimão plateau sit
on top on two faults, as shown in Fig. 9. According to this the Portimão
plateau can be interpreted as a pop-up structure. The D. Carlos valley lies
at the south-western edge of the Guadalquivir acoustic basement high
that, at the precise location of this seismic profile, bears a WNW–ESE
strike as can be seen on the bathymetry (Fig. 4). The drag evident in the
sediments of the uppermost sequence and the superficial gravity ex-
tensional faults indicate that the northernmost valley flank fault is
undergoing extensional deformation at Present. The folds in the
Mesozoic through Miocene–Lower Pliocene of the central and northern
parts of the Portimão pop-up depict an asymmetry that indicates
northwards tectonic transport on top of the acoustic basement fault.

Since it has been known for long that the Guadalquivir Bank is
made up of Variscan basement metamorphosed flysch of Carbonifer-
ous age (e.g. Ribeiro et al., 1979; Gràcia et al., 2003a,b) the stratigraphy
across the northern fault of the Faro valley implies that it played an
extensional role during the Mesozoic followed by northwards directed
thrusting during the Paleogene through Miocene and resumed
extensional movement during Pliocene–Quaternary times.

165P. Terrinha et al. / Marine Geology 267 (2009) 156–174
The southern boundary of the Portimão pop-up block shows both the
topography and the Mesozoic through Quaternary sedimentary
packages dipping to the south (Fig. 9). The following features are also
evident in the seismic line across the southern part of Portimão plateau
(Fig. 9), as follows: i) tectonic deformation affects the topmost sedi-
ments (Fig. 6F), ii) the pre-Pliocene folds asymmetry is southwards
verging, iii) there is no correspondence on the seismic stratigraphy
between the pre-Pliocene sediments of the Portimão pop-up and the
southern counterpart and iv) the Mesozoic units show a wedge geo-
metry. From these observations it is inferred that, firstly, this boundary of
the Portimão plateau is an old fault with opposite dip with respect to the
north boundary of the plateau, secondly, this was a northerly dipping
extensional fault during the Mesozoic, thirdly, it was inverted with a
southwards directed tectonic transport during the Paleogene through
Miocene times and, fourthly it is going tectonic deformation at Present.

The southernmost segment of the seismic profile in Fig. 9 cuts
across the Cadiz valley and up slope the gently dipping north western
part of the Gulf of Cadiz accretionary wedge. The profile shows a sub-
horizontal, mildly deformed sequence of sediments covering the
chaotic seismic facies of the accretionary wedge or imbricate thrust
wedge, as described by Gutscher et al. (2002) and Iribarren et al.
(2007), respectively. The base of the chaotic seismic facies unit is
made up by coherent high amplitude reflectors here interpreted as
Jurassic through Cretaceous syn-rift sediments on top of which de-
tached the thrust wedge. It is worthwhile to note that these sediments
are disrupted by vertical discontinuities, with small vertical displace-
ment, that can be followed up into the chaotic body and overlying
topmost sequence.

The sub-vertical discontinuity that separates the Portimão plateau
from the southern plain is neither compatible with thrusting nor
with extensional tectonics (Fig. 9). Alternatively, it is interpreted as a
transpressive E–W trending strike-slip fault at Present based on the
fact that it displays evidence of shortening structures, folds and north
wards and south wards directed thrusts on both sides of the fault.
These observations imply that the main compression direction rotated
from high angle to low angle with respect to the E–W strike of the
faults, which is compatible with the counter-clockwise rotation of the
movement of Africa with respect to Iberia in the Cenozoic, from
approximately south to north in the Paleogene, to south east to north
west in the Miocene to ESE to WNW in the Present (Dewey et al.,
1989).

The circular dome protruding the top of the Portimão plateau
depicted in the bathymetry is interpreted as D. Carlos salt diapir
(Figs. 1, 4 and 10). The salt does not outcrop at the surface but is
popping-up underneath the sedimentary cover. The two reverse faults
that bound this structure were interpreted as smaller scale structures
accommodating internal shortening across the Guadalquivir Bank by
Zitellini et al. (2004). This is a clear example where the map view
image clarifies specific not fully understood superficial structures in
reflection seismics.

The deep structure of the WNW–ESE trending lineaments (Fig. 8)
is imaged in the seismic profiles shown in Figs. 9, 10 and 11 in the
work of Rosas et al. (2009). It can be seen in these seismic profiles that
the rectilinear morphologic lineaments overlie vertical discontinuities
that are rooted far below the accretionary wedge detachment, i.e. into
the Jurassic sediments. These discontinuities cut the Mesozoic into
blocks of 3–5 km of width, with small vertical offset and stratigraphic
mismatch. The symmetry of the upward drag of the seismic horizons
with respect to these discontinuities from the deepest stratigraphic
levels across the chaotic facies, the disturbance observed in the cover

166 P. Terrinha et al. / Marine Geology 267 (2009) 156–174
sediments and the existence of mud volcanoes sitting on top of these
lineaments (Figs. 8 and 12), strongly argues in favour of upward
injection of fluids along these faults (cf. with Figs. 9 and 11). These
characteristics strongly suggest that these discontinuities can corre-
spond to tensile fractures with a strike-slip movement component.

The pervasive set of E–W trending undulations that accompany the
E–W to WNW–ESE trending faults are en echelon folds (Figs. 7 and 11),
i.e. kinematic indicators that show a dextral strike-slip lateral move-
ment on these faults.

The growth wedge of Mesozoic sediments clearly associated to
some of these WNW–ESE trending faults (Fig. 10) is another indi-
cation for the deep root of these faults.

3.2. N–S to NE–SW faults

The Aljezur canyon–Sagres valley and the Portimão canyon sit on
top of the offshore prolongation of the Aljezur and Portimão faults,
respectively (Figs. 2 and 8). Inspection of the seismic profiles con-
firms the Pliocene–Quaternary activity of these faults that show an
important decrease in tectonic deformation after Miocene times
(Figs. 12 and 13). The offshore mapping of these faults shows they
have continuous segments larger than 100 km in length that, when
added together with the onshore segments, they constitute discon-
tinuous steep faults of approximately 200 km long, as happens with
the left-lateral strike-slip late Variscan faults in the central and
northern parts of the Iberian peninsula (Arthaud and Matte, 1977;
Ribeiro, 2002), which are also active in the Quaternary (Cabral,
1989).

The Tagus Abyssal Plain Fault is proposed on the basis of the N–S
trending sharp morphological scarp that lies to the north of the
Gorringe Bank thrust. However, recent unpublished work by Cunha
(2008) confirms the existence of this reverse fault that cross cuts
Pliocene–Quaternary sediments.

The São Vicente Fault strikes NE–SW (Fig. 14) outcrops along the
southeast flank of the São Vicente canyon. It is a southeastwards
dipping steep fault, possibly part of the Odemira–Ávila fault (also
known as the Messejana dyke), an approximately 600 km long
vertical left-lateral late Variscan fault intruded by a basic dyke of
Early Jurassic age (Dunn et al., 1998). Pliocene–Quaternary vertical
displacement along this fault onshore was described by Cabral (1995).

The NE–SW trending Horseshoe fault was described as an active
fault in the Present by Gràcia et al. (2003a,b) and Zitellini et al. (2004),
and has a cluster of seismicity associated to it (Figs. 1 and 2). Its fault
scarp is very well depicted in the MATESPRO bathymetry, from the
Coral Patch Ridge well into the South Portuguese continental slope
bordering the Sagres plateau. It can be seen that the height of the
scarp increases northwards and it is intercepted by WNW–ESE
trending faults. At these interceptions the Horseshoe fault scarp is
either deflected or offset across the WNW–ESE dextral strike-slip
faults and landslides formed (Figs. 4, 5, 6C and 8).

the seafloor as imaged on the MATESPRO bathymetry (see Figs. 3 and 7). Note that these faults cut across seismic discontinuity D that outlines the decollement of the seismic chaotic
facies.

The NE–SW escarpments at the back of the Horseshoe fault host
some of the crescent shaped Giant Scours described elsewhere in this
work. These scarps sit on top of blind thrusts, as shown in Fig. 15 that
appear to be recent reactivation of individual faults from within the
Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge or Gulf of Cadiz Imbricate Unit, after
Gutscher et al. (2002) or Iribarren et al. (2007), respectively. Single-
channel seismic line across two of the Giant Scours show that the
internal parts of the crescents consist of depressions filled in with
upslope prograding sedimentary units. These units develop towards
the Giant Scour crescent shaped scarp, which sharply truncates sedi-
ments behind it (Fig. 16).

3.3. Chaotic seismic units

The MATESPRO bathymetry clearly shows the divide between the
wrinkled topography that overlies the Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary
Wedge, after Gutscher et al. (2002) and the surrounding smoother
areas (Figs. 2 and 4). The MCS profiles shown in Figs. 12 and 15 show
the existence of a complex of stacked thrusts underneath the wrinkled
surface of the so-called accretionary wedge and also under the
smoother topography of the Sagres and Cadiz valleys.

In all seismic profiles it is evident that the complex of stacked
thrusts is overlain by a package of sediments that is not involved in
fluidized sediments breaching through the Mesozoic rift units and accretionary prism.

inversion on both sides of the Portimão canyon fault. However, mild deformation associated with this fault is visible on the eastern side of the fault and canyon. The salt-wall shown
in the east of the profile also affects the recent sediments.

the thrust stacking. The thickness of this sedimentary cover is gene-
rally around 0.3–05 sec. TWT and the earliest age of these sediments is
Early Pliocene after Roque (2007). However, this sedimentary cover is
deformed by the E–W to WNW–ESE dextral strike-slip faults and by
discrete reactivation of individual thrusts of the stacked thrusts units,
as described elsewhere in this work, as well as, by widespread extru-
sion of mud volcanism, gravitational faulting described by various
authors as mentioned before.

A unit of chaotic facies that has neither coherent internal layer-
ing nor imbricate fabrics, probably an olistostrome, is shown in
Fig. 10. This unit is not involved in the thrust stacking of the
accretionary wedge and is overlain by the well layered Pliocene–
Quaternary sediments. This olistostrome lies between the Portimão
Bank and the wrinkled surface of the Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary
Wedge, in the Cadiz valley. It is worthwhile to note that the
olistostrome pinches out on top of the Portimão Bank, suggesting
that it could have been fed from the uplifted area of the Portimão
Bank during the Tortonian phase of compression, i.e. the pop-up of
the bank.

4. Discussion

4.1. Morphology and tectonics

4.1.1. The escarpments and seamounts
It was shown in this paper that the E–W trending Portimão Bank

formed initially as a graben during Mesozoic times, was subsequently
inverted during the Paleogene and Miocene compression and is now,
probably since Early Pliocene times, undergoing dextral transpressive
strike-slip deformation along its southern boundary, while the
northern boundary experiences local extension due to a releasing
bend formed by the basement fault. Seismicity and focal mechanisms
(Fig. 2) attest for the compression at the southern edge of this sea-
mount, preferentially concentrated to the east of the study area where
the fault becomes NE–SW trending, i.e. at a higher angle to the main
NW–SE oriented compression direction.

The Sagres plateau is bound by the NE–SW trending Horseshoe
thrust of Miocene age in the west (Gràcia et al., 2003a,b, Zitellini et al.,
2004) and the steeply dipping Aljezur fault in the east. The height of
the main fault controlling the position of the eastern flank of the canyon. This is a steep

the plateau diminishes towards the south and its morphological ex-
pression disappears at the contact with one of the WNW–ESE strike-
slip faults. The cluster of instrumental seismicity in Fig. 2 attests for its
present day activity (Stich et al., 2007).

The Marquês de Pombal plateau also resulted from tectonic
inversion of an N–S trending continent-wards directed extensional
fault. The Pereira de Sousa fault is a N–S trending steep Mesozoic rift
fault still in activity at Present (Terrinha et al., 2003; Gràcia et al.,
2003a,b).

the escarpment. For location see Figs. 3 and 7.
The north westwards directed Gorringe Bank thrust with a paro-
xysmal activity in the Tortonian (after Tortella et al., 1997; Sartori
et al., 1994) is still an active structure as attested by the instrumental
seismicity cluster (Fig. 2).

It can be concluded that the escarpments, seamounts and uplifted
plateaus of the study area, all formed in association with compressive
tectonic events and resulted from polyphase tectonics. The Pereira de
Sousa fault escarpment is the only one that owes its morphology
mostly to the Mesozoic rifting.
n. Note the erosive character of the escarpments and the sediments prograding towards



170 P. Terrinha et al. / Marine Geology 267 (2009) 156–174
The tectonic shaping processes are still active in the Present, as
shown by the on-going formation of very recent features that are
indicative of uplift and tectonic instability, such as the popping-up of
the D. Carlos salt diapir (Fig. 10), the mass wasting processes, such as
submarine slides and various manifestations of soft sediment defor-
mation and mass wasting processes in the Sagres plateau–Aljezur
canyon, the São Vicente canyon and the Portimão plateau, Horseshoe
Faul scarp, as well as, on the Marquês de Pombal, Gorringe and Pereira
de Sousa escarpments as described by Gràcia et al. (2003a,b), Terrinha
et al. (2003) and Vizcaino et al. (2006).

4.1.2. The Giant Scours
The Giant Scours are crescent shaped depressions with scarps that

can reach more than 100 m high and slopes up to 27° located in a relative
flat area of the Horseshoe Valley that collects the sediments from the
Northern and North-eastern parts of the Gulf of Cadiz (Figs. 4, 5 and 7).
The scours sit on the edge of folds draping Pliocene to Quaternary
thrusting and the frontal depressions are filed up with upslope pro-
gradational bodies (Figs. 15 and 16). These bodies can be interpreted as
been fed by material withdrawn from the retreating scarps (Fig. 17;
Duarte et al., 2007). This scenario requires the existence of continuous
scouring and sedimentation at unusual depths by means of bottom
currents, possibly of turbidite origin as documented offshore the
Shetland Islands and Monterrey East Channel (Kenyon et al., 2000;
Kenyon et al., 2006; Fildani et al., 2006). The interaction of bottom and
turbidity currents with seafloor morphological features formed by
Recent tectonic activity can lead to flux separation and formation of
vortexes that cause seafloor erosion and the formation of scours. These
processes were proposed for the formation of similar structures in other
places and different geological settings between 600 m and 3500 m
water depth (Faugères et al., 1997; Bulat and Long, 2001; Verdicchio and
Trincardi, 2006; Fildani et al., 2006). This process could account
simultaneously for the formation of the scarp of the scour, the pro-
gradational bodies and the maintenance of the scarp, at least as long as
the bottom current lasted and the retreating escarpment does not meet
an obstacle.

An alternative model is that the Giant Scours could form due to the
interaction of along slope bottom currents with the sea floor, such as
the North Atlantic Deep Water. This interaction could lead to the
formation of giant eddies that could locally erode and amplify pre-
existing tectonic escarpments. However, the existence of along slope
currents at these depths has not been documented in this area.

Evidences for alternative mechanisms for the formation of these
features, such as slide–slump processes caused by slope instabilities or
collapse processes associated with fluid escape along major tectonic
structures (similar to those of pockmark formation), were not
observed on the present dataset despite the evidences for mass
wasting processes, and the existence of widespread mud volcanism
and fluid migration activity in other areas of the Gulf of Cadiz.

4.1.3. The canyons
The São Vicente and Portimão canyons are by far the deepest

incisions on the northern margin of the Gulf of Cadiz and they are
underlain and controlled by important steep faults. The Aljezur

taneous progressive sedimentation of the progradation foresets. Scarp initially formed

canyon–Sagres valley system is also controlled by a steep fault. These
offshore faults connect with others that were inherited from the late
Variscan fracturing, subsequently reactivated during the Mesozoic
rifting and Cenozoic tectonic inversion (see Fig. 2).

The MCS profiles shown in this work attest for the Quaternary
activity of these faults but also show that the deformation after
Miocene times has severely diminished in the case of the Portimão
and Aljezur faults.

Gràcia et al. (2003a,b) and Zitellini et al. (2004) showed the
important activity of the northern segment of the Horseshoe fault that
constitutes the eastern flank of the terminal part of the São Vicente
canyon.

The São Vicente and Portimão canyons show important gravity
slides on their western flanks. This can be interpreted as caused by the
increase of the tilting associated with the west wards directed
thrusting of the Marquês de Pombal and Horseshoe faults. Alterna-
tively, in the Sagres valley the sliding can be caused by excavation at
the meeting point of this valley with the Cadiz valley.

The minor present day tectonic deformation on the faults that
control the localization of the canyons together with the important
incision and land sliding close to the active Marquês de Pombal and
Horseshoe thrusts can be interpreted as an indication of passive uplift
of the continental slope carried on top of these thrusts.

4.1.4. The chaotic bodies
Three bodies of chaotic facies were distinguished in this work, all

covered by unit hemipelagic sediments usually of 0.3–0.5 sec TWT.
One is referred to as the Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge (GCAW) by
Gutscher et al. (2002) or alternatively as the Gulf of Cadiz Imbricate
Wedge by Iribarren et al. (2007). This body has a strong morphologic
imprint on the seafloor morphology (Fig. 12).

A second one, that extends across the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain and
Horseshoe Valley, has been considered as a gravitational unit, an
olistostrome (e.g. Torelli et al., 1997; Iribarren et al., 2007). It is shown
in this paper that this unit (Figs. 12 and 15) has imbricate seismic
reflections that are interpreted as stacked thrusts, some of which have
been recently reactivated forming blind thrusts morphologic scarps
where the Giant Scours nucleated. These recent scarps are, however,
the only morphologic manifestation on the seafloor surface of this
body.

A third body with internal non-organized chaotic facies overlies
the first described one, as shown in Fig. 10.

It is shown in this work that the two first described bodies consist
of complexes of stacked thrusts and that the GCAW overthrusts the
second one to the west (Fig. 10). Considering that these are tectono-
stratigraphic units we speculate that only one accretionary wedge
(or imbricate wedge) formed during the latest Cretaceous and Paleogene
(perhaps through the Early Miocene). This event occurred before the
Gibraltar arc formed (when the Internal Betic terranes were still a long
way farther east, Fig. 18B). Then, from Early Miocene to earliest Pliocene
(or Messinian?) times, when the Gibraltar orogenic arc formed, a part of
this accretionary wedge was tectonically reworked forming the present
day GCAW and its wrinkled topography (Fig. 18C). From the Pliocene to
Present the thrust stacking within the GCAW severely diminished and
the WNW–ESE dextral strike-slip faults formed (Fig. 18 D).

From a genetic point of view we consider the first two chaotic
bodies as tectonic melanges made up of tectonised olistostromes and
tectonosomes (see Camerlenghi and Pini, 2009 for discussion). The
third chaotic body is a non tectonised olistostrome.

4.1.5. The WNW–ESE lineaments, strike-slip faults and recent folding
The WNW–ESE lineaments shown by the MATESPRO bathymetry

in this paper (Fig. 7) display a series of en echelon folds materialized on
the most recent seafloor soft sediments that indicate strain accumu-
lation by means of dextral strike-slip (Figs. 3 and 6). Rosas et al. (2009)
using quantitative strain analysis, analogue modelling and MCS data



Fig. 18. Schematic tectonic evolution of the structure of the Gulf of Cadiz. In this simplified interpretation it is proposed the formation of an accretionary wedge (or thrust belt) that extended
from Gibraltar across theHorseshoe Abyssal Plain during the latest Cretaceous–Paleogene compression. A secondaccretionary wedgeformed (after Gutscher et al., 2002, or imbricate unit after
Iribarren et al., 2007) during the Gibraltar orogenic arc westward overthrusting in Miocene times. In Pliocene–Quaternary times this accretionary wedge severely diminished its activity, the
WNW–ESE dextral strike-slip faults formed and westward directed thrust increased along faults on the southern part of the West Portuguese Margin. See text for detailed discussion.

171P. Terrinha et al. / Marine Geology 267 (2009) 156–174
showed that these en echelon folds result from Quaternary reactiva-
tion of basement faults.

Inspection of MCS profiles in this paper show that these WNW–ESE
faults are deeply rooted into the Jurassic–Cretaceous rift sequences,
which is compatible to observations made onshore in the Algarve Basin
at the Lower Jurassic of the S. Vicente cape (Ribeiro and Terrinha, 2007).

These faults also serve as conduits for the exhalation of fluidized
sediments that form some of the Gulf of Cadiz mud volcanoes (Fig. 2),
which is another evidence of the recent activity of the faults and also
that they cut through the Gulf of Cadiz accretionary prism. Moreover,
as shown on the MCS profile in Figs. 11 and 12, these strike-slip faults
allow the escape of fluids from within deep in the Mesozoic sequences,
probably at the Hettangian stratigraphic level that hosts the salt in
south Portugal and northwest Morocco (Terrinha, 1998).

The strike-slip faults and folding are also active in the Horseshoe
Abyssal Plain. However, the scarce morphotectonic features associat-
ed to these faults in the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain when compared to
the continental slope to the east, suggests a westwards propagation of
the recent deformation on the WNW–ESE faults, away from the
Gibraltar Arc.

Because i) these faults have only recently been reactivated as strike-
slip faults, ii) they strike at only a small angle to the present day
trajectory of Africa with respect to Iberia, according to recently reported
geodetic models (Fig. 8), iii) their minimum length exceeds 230 km as
shown in the presented bathymetry and iv) they cut across the
Horseshoe Abyssal Plain and the Gulf of Cadiz accretionary wedge; it is
here suggested that they will play an important tectonic role in the new
tectonic framework that is presently under development between Iberia
and Nubia. As a matter of fact, some of the WNW–ESE faults described
here are located within a 600 km×40 km shear zone proposed by
Zitellini et al. (2009) as a segment of the Eurasia–Nubia plate boundary
that spans from the eastern tip of the Gloria Fault to the Rif–Tell plate
boundary in north-western Morocco (Morel and Megrhraoui, 1996).

4.2. Strain partitioning, deformation migration and seismicity

The studied dataset shows that the E–W trending faults were
inherited from the Jurassic–Lower Cretaceous rifting and subsequently
inverted as reverse faults duringthe Cenozoic (Fig. 8); thesame applies to
the NE–SW to N–S trending faults as shown in previous works (Terrinha,
1998; Terrinha et al., 2002; Terrinha et al., 2003; Gràcia et al., 2003a;
Rovere et al., 2004; Ribeiro and Terrinha, 2007). It was also shown that
the Gulf of Cadiz accretionary wedge has diminished significantly its
activity since latest Miocene times, possibly Early Pliocene, although
disperse thrusts that still remain blind underneath the Messinian–Recent
sediments are presently reactivated (Figs. 12 and 15).

Based on the presented dataset, we propose that the present day
WNW–ESE convergent movement of Africa with respect to Iberia
generates deformation in the study area, which is accommodated
through partitioning on two approximately orthogonal fault sets, as
follows. An N–S to NE–SW striking set of faults that accommodate
shortening mainly by thrusting and an E–W to WNW–ESE striking,
generally sub-vertical, set of faults that accommodate dextral strike-
slip faulting.

The first set comprehends the main thrust faults of the area,
Horseshoe Fault, Marquês de Pombal fault and Tagus Abyssal Plain



172 P. Terrinha et al. / Marine Geology 267 (2009) 156–174
fault (see map of Fig. 2) that extend the Present east to west short-
ening for approximately 300 km from the South, near the contact with
the Coral Patch Ridge (35.5°N), towards the north, along the West
Portuguese Margin until a latitude of 38°N, as recently shown by
Neves et al. (2009).

The second fault set is deeply rooted in Jurassic through Cretaceous
rifting faults and were reactivated mainly in the Pliocene–Quaternary as
dextral strike-slip faults, which is compatible with the present day
movement of Nubia with respect to Iberia. These faults show consid-
erably higher degree of deformation in the east than in the west, which
argues in favour of propagation of deformation from east to west.

The thrusting on the N–S Marquês de Pombal fault is recent, as well as,
on the Gorringe Bank fault (that had a quiescence period after the
Tortonian), on the Tagus Abyssal Plain Fault (Cunha, 2008) and at the N–S
trending faults at 38°N (Neves et al., 2009). Altogether, these observations
lead us to argue that the deformation is migrating from the realm of
Gibraltar to the west and along the Portuguese West Margin to the north.

Considering the sub-parallel strike of the N–S to NE–SW faults, their
common origin in the Permian and reactivation during the Mesozoic
rifting and Cenozoic inversion, it is here suggested that this 300 km en
echelon fault zone can have a common detachment, underneath SW
Iberia. Since the tomography data presented in Gutscher et al. (2002)
suggest that the Horseshoe may penetrate at least till 100 km in the
lithosphere, the 300 km long N–S trending fault system should be
considered as firstly, a possible source candidate for the Lisbon 1/11/
1755 earthquake and secondly, the propagation of a new front of
compressive deformation towards the north along the West Portuguese
Margin, which will eventually lead to the nucleation of a West Iberia
incipient subduction zone, as proposed by Ribeiro et al. (1996).

Alternatively, even if these faults do not have a common detach-
ment, a complex rupture scenario can be envisaged to explain the large
energy released during the 1755 event. Complex seismic ruptures have
been documented in other locations, such as, for instance the 1958
Gobi-Altay event which produced 260 km of surface rupture from the
segmented main fault with a strike-slip movement and simultaneous
rupture of nearby thrust faults (Kurushin et al., 1997), or the Tangshan
earthquake of 1976, which was a combination of several ruptures,
strike-slip and thrust faults, following each other only a few tens of
seconds (Butler et al., 1979). The hypothesis of complex ruptures
involving triggering or “domino-effect” is consistent with the majority
of the historical documents that report a very long vibration (up to
20–30 min) and various sub-events for the 1st November 1755
earthquake (e.g. Martinez-Solares, 2001).

We alsospeculate thatthe location of recentepicentres in front ofthe
Horseshoe fault in the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain, such as the 1969 event
(Ms=7.9) (Fukao, 1973), as well as the Mw=6.0 12/02/2007 and the
ML=4.5 21/06/2006 events (Stich et al., 2007), all with a major dip-slip
component can be interpreted as an indication of nucleation of new
thrusts to the west of the main Horseshoe fault.

The NW–SE SHmax direction calculated from earthquake focal
mechanism is in very good agreement with the Eurasia–Africa con-
vergence direction estimated by the NUVEL-1 model (DeMets et al.,
1994). However, recent estimates of this velocity using space geodetic
techniques, andconsideringtheAfrica plate split into Nubia and Somalia,
give for the Nubia–Eurasia collision a WNW–ESE direction, in the middle
of theGulf of Cadiz (Fig. 8). This discrepancy is interpreted asthecoupled
result of strain partitioning on E–W and NNE–SSW trending faults and
aseismic deformation along the plate boundary.

5. Conclusions

The following conclusions are drawn.

1. The escarpments, seamounts and uplifted plateaus of the study area,
all formed in association with polyphase compressive tectonic events
from the late Cretaceous through Present, with the exception of the
Pereira de Sousa fault escarpment that owes most of its morphology
to the Mesozoic rifting. The Quaternary uplift has generated mass
transport deposits (also reported by Gràcia et al. (2003a,b), Terrinha
et al. (2003) and Vizcainoet al. (2006)), kilometric scale soft sediment
unstable folds on the continental slope and incision of the canyons.

2. The Giant Scours display erosive and depositional structures
that result from vortexes of high-density bottom currents at
the edge of scarps formed at the crest of blind thrusts anticlines
of Recent age.

3. The chaotic bodies buried under uppermost Miocene–lower Pliocene
sediments in the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain and Horseshoe Valley
together with the GCAW formed as stacked thrusts (possibly an
accretionary wedge) in the Late Cretaceous–Earliest Miocene times
before the emplacement of the Gibraltar orogenic Arc. Miocene
reactivation of the eastern part of this body originated the GCAW and
thrusting of this tectono-stratigraphic unit to the west. The third
chaotic body corresponds to a non tectonised olistostrome that seals
the most important thrust stacking in early Pliocene times.

4. The WNW–ESE trending lineaments are the superficial expression
of steep faults deeply rooted in the Mesozoic substratum and
underlying acoustic basement or Paleozoic basement onshore.
Segments of these faults acted as rift faults during the Mesozoic
and were reactivated in Quaternary times as strike-slip faults that
cross cut the NE–SW trending thrusts.

5. The present day NW-wards movement of Nubia with respect to
Iberia generates strain partitioning by means of dextral wrenching
on WNW–ESE trending steep faults and thrusting on the NE–SW
trending fault in the Gulf of Cadiz and Horseshoe Abyssal Plain.
Further north, at the base of the continental slope of the south-
ernmost part of the West Iberia Margin, NNE–SSW to N–S west-
erly dipping thrusts accommodate shortening in an area where
wrenching has not been observed, which indicates that westward
directed thrusting propagated from the Gibraltar Arc to the west
(Horseshoe Fault) and to the north along the Portuguese margin
(Marquês de Pombal Fault and Tagus Abyssal Plain Fault).

beam bathymetry data allowed the recognition of several bathymetric lineaments
(ca. 100 km long, trending WNW–ESE) in seafloor sediments of the Gulf of Cadiz, offshore SW Iberia. The
interpretation of multi-channel (MCS) profiles crosscutting these lineaments showed that they are controlled
by underlying deep seated faults, which have endured a polyphase reactivation history. To get insights on the
Recent tectonic evolution of these structures, we performed two sets of analogue modelling experiments,
assuming: 1) right-lateral strike-slip basement faulting and coupled passive shearing affecting an overlying
soft cover; and 2) low-angle transpressive deformation along a narrow shear band overlying the fault. Our
results show a good correlation between the experimentally obtained structural patterns and the natural
morphotectonic lineaments, allowing the use of some of the observed natural features as strain gauges. Based
on this, we conclude that the study lineaments correspond to the bathymetric expression of ongoing dextral
wrenching reactivation of WNW–ESE pre-existing faults, and we estimate the age of this tectonic reactivation
as being ca. 1.8 Ma (i.e. form late Pliocene to Present day). These characteristics agree with the most recent
kinematic models derived from geodetic observations, indicating that Present day convergence between
Nubia and Iberia is subparallel to the newly identified lineaments and occurs at a 4 mm/yr rate.

1. Introduction
The Gulf of Cadiz area, located West of the Gibraltar Strait, offshore
SW Iberia and NW Morocco (Fig. 1), has been increasingly recognized
as a critical site for the understanding of the tectonics related with the
Africa (Nubia)–Iberia plate boundary (e.g. Sartori et al., 1994; Zitellini
et al., 1999; Maldonado et al., 1999; Gutscher et al., 2002; Gracia et al.,
2003; Terrinha et al., 2003; Gutscher, 2004; Zitellini et al., 2001, 2004;
Medialdea et al., 2004; Thiebot and Gutscher, 2006; Terrinha et al.,
under review). This boundary extends along the WNW–ESE Azores–
Gibraltar line, comprising to the West the Azores triple junction and
the Gloria fault, and to the East the Gulf of Cadiz domain (Fig. 1A). In
this domain, the average direction of the Maximum Horizontal
Compressive Stresses (SHmax), deduced from earthquake focal
mechanisms, is ~N45W (Ribeiro et al., 1996; Borges et al., 2001),
meanwhile recently reported geodetic models show the existence of
WNW–ESE oblique convergence between Nubia and Iberia, at a
Present day rate of approximately 4 mm/yr (e.g. Nocquet and Calais,
+351 21 7500064.

2004; Stich et al., 2006; Fernandes et al., 2007, inset of Fig. 1B). Recent
mapping of the main tectonic structures in the area (Fig. 1B) suggests
that compression is presently being dissipated in a complex manner,
essentially through inter-plate brittle deformation, characterized by
the development of different structures with different orientations
and kinematics. Previously reported earthquake recurrence data,
epicentre location data, and focal mechanisms (Buforn et al., 1995,
2004; Borges et al., 2001; Stich et al., 2005, 2006) point to a general
scenario of moderate magnitude seismicity, mostly related to
thrusting and strike-slip movement, along numerous faults at shallow
to intermediate depths (above 60 km). This area is also prone to high
magnitude earthquakes and destructive tsunami like the 1/11/1755
Great Lisbon Earthquake (estimated magnitude between 8.5 and 8.8,
e.g. Abe, 1979; Johnston, 1996; Martínez-Solares and López Arroyo,
2004). Other large magnitude events, such as the 28/02/1969
earthquake (Ms=7.9) occurring in the Gulf of Cadiz illustrate the
practical need to improve our knowledge regarding the Present day
tectonic evolution of this key region.

In this work we present new results concerning the study of
several major bathymetric lineaments, recorded in recent seafloor
sediments of the NW Gulf of Cadiz area. These features were firstly
recognized using the high-resolution multi-beam bathymetry

under review), and were subsequently studied using several multi-
channel seismic (MCS) profiles. In addition, several analogue model-
ling experiments were carried out to get new insight on their origin,
kinematic evolution and tectonic meaning. This was done through
comparison of the obtained experimental results with the correspon-
dent natural examples, which showed that some morphotectonic
patterns associated to the lineaments could be used in a quantitative
manner, as natural strain gauges, allowing a better understanding of
the main tectonic processes at stake.

2. Morphotectonic characterization of the study objects

2.1. Morphologic description

The new MATESPRO bathymetry dataset obtained in NW Gulf of
Cadiz revealed a complex geomorphology, interpreted as the result of
the combined action of different processes such as tectonics,
sedimentation, gravity, and submarine erosion (Terrinha et al.,
under review). These data allowed, for the first time, the identification
of several major bathymetric lineaments (L1 to L4 in Fig. 2). These
linear features strike approximately WNW–ESE, exhibiting widths of a
few kilometres (typically 1.5 km to 3 km), and maximum bathymetric
lengths of ca. 100 km. L1 is best characterized by sets of discontinuous
oblique (W–E) morphologic undulations, consisting in alternating
crest and troughs up to 6 km long, displaying a general en-échelon
geometrical disposition (Fig. 3A,B and C); L2 exhibits an overall more
continuous morphology, characterized by two main wide elevated
areas, elongated along strike, and located on opposite sides of a central
linear trough (Fig. 3D).

Unlike the previous described lineaments, L3 is barely seen in the
high-resolution bathymetry. The L4 lineament, although clearly
observable in the bathymetry, does not show any consistently
interpretable morphologic patterns, probably due to the incoherent
rheology response to stress of the tectonic mélange of the Gulf of Cadiz
accretionary wedge (see AW in Fig. 1B). For much of its length, L4
coincides with the northern border of this disturbed seafloor domain,
suggesting that it may be controlled by a deep structure. Because of
these features in the present work we will concentrate on L1 and L2 as
the main targets for our analogue modelling.

lineaments, interpreted in Fig. 4.
2.2. Structural characterization

The MCS reflection profiles which crosscut the lineaments L1 to L3
show that these coincide with deep seated faults (Figs. 2 and 4). Taking
into account the previously established seismostratigraphy in the area
(e.g. Sartori et al., 1994; Torelli et al., 1997; Tortella et al., 1997), the
interpretation of different segments of the IAM line (Fig. 4) shows that
these faults cut through Mesozoic units (Jurassic to Cretaceous age),
and through a late Miocene (Tortonian) body with a typical chaotic
seismic signature. They also often seem to coincide with possible paths
of abundant upwards fluid migration, seemingly originated at the base
of the Mesozoic (Fig. 4A), and previously recognized by several authors
in this area (e.g. Somoza et al., 2003; Pinheiro et al., 2003; Hensen et al.,
2007).The upper units of the seismostratigraphic sequence correspond
to hemipelagic sediments of Plio-Quaternary age, with thickness
varying between 0.3 and 0.6 s TWT. In the IAM3 line, the fault
corresponding to the L1 lineament, bordering the north-eastern flank of
the Coral Patch Ridge (CPR, Fig. 4), is interpreted has having behaved as
a reverse fault, since the Mesozoic reflectors in the hanging wall reveal a
folding geometry congruent with shortening (Fig. 5). Based only on
these profiles it was not possible to ascribe a definite kinematic
evolution to the other (L2 and L3) faults. The Plio-Quaternary
hemipelagic sediments, although some times locally folded, are
generally not cut by the described faults (Fig. 4B). This suggests that
the reverse fault kinematics mentioned above, does not correspond to
the Present day active kinematics on these structures.

Both the morphological and structural description of the study
objects points to the conclusion that these lineaments correspond to
the bathymetric expression of major WNW–ESE trending faults. The
examined MCS lines show the Plio-Quaternary hemipelagic sediments
sealing the faults (Fig. 4), suggesting that the bulk movement along
these structures does not correspond to active thrusting. Furthermore,
the en-échelon crests and troughs associated to L1 seem compatible
with a Present day dextral wrenching reactivation (Fig. 3A, B and C).

The same MCS lines also show that the fault associated to L2
extends along ca. 200 km, from the accretionary wedge in the East,
coinciding with several previously described mud volcanoes (e.g.
Pinheiro et al., 2003), to the Horseshoe abyssal plain in the West,
where it looses its morphologic expression (Figs. 1B and 2). It should

be noted that with the available MCS dataset the deep seated fault
associated to L2 is perfectible traceable in the Horseshoe abyssal plain,
and further to the West until the base of the Gorringe Ridge. The
mentioned fact that its bathymetric expression is practically non-
existent in this area is probably due to an average greater thickness of
the post Mesozoic sediment pile, particularly in the area close to the
footwall of the Horseshoe fault.

3. Analogue modelling

In the study area recently reported kinematic models derived from
geodetic data (Nocquet and Calais, 2004; Stich et al., 2006; Fernandes
et al., 2007) show a Present day 4 mm/yr convergence rate, along a
direction subparallel to the trend of the study morphotectonic
lineaments (see inset of Fig. 1B). This agrees with the general
possibility of the prevailing compression being presently dissipated
through bulk dextral wrenching along the major faults associated to
these lineaments, which was the main focus of our analogue
modelling.

In the NW Gulf of Cadiz area, the detailed vertical rheology profile
of the lithosphere, and of the uppermost crust, is unknown. However,
a non-negligible rheology contrast must exist between the lithified,
harder, Mesozoic units, and the uppermost soft sedimentary cover,
corresponding in part to the unconsolidated hemipelagic sediments of
Plio-Quaternary age. If so, bulk dissipation of the compressive stress
must preferably occur in the Mesozoic rigid basement, through dextral

strike-slip faulting, deforming the overlying soft cover mostly in a
passive manner. Therefore, our first set of experiments consisted on
the simulation of basement, right-lateral, strike-slip faulting, and
coupled passive shearing in an overlying soft cover.

Nonetheless, given the uncertainty of the upper crust rheology
profile in the area, we also preformed a second set of experiments
assuming that the study faults could nucleate low-angle transpressive
shearing along an narrow band in the overlying sediments. This
possibility implies the assumption of a different rheology structure for
the upper crust, comprising a less abrupt rheology contrast between a
somewhat less viscous basement and the softer sedimentary cover.
Accordingly, the previously faulted Mesozoic basement must be able
to deform, at least to some degree, in a ductile way to allow low-angle
transpressive shearing in the soft cover sediments along a narrow
band overlying the fault. It should be noted that in the case of this
second set of experiments, our objective was simply to look at the kind
of morphotectonic pattern that is expected to form in the soft cover
alone, under the mentioned transpressional conditions. In all situa-
tions, we focused mainly on the ductile experimental output,
comparing both results with the various natural examples. For the
basement strike-slip deformation experiments, we further use this
comparison to quantify the amount of shear strain (?), the along strike
displacement (?x), and the age of the corresponding shearing
deformation affecting the soft cover sediments.

The present simulation of wrench fault systems and associated
passive shearing follows, with some modifications, the work
hologic features. (C) View of L1 from ESE. AB bathymetric profile just north of L1. White

previously put forward by other authors (e.g. Wilcox et al., 1973;
Richard et al., 1991; Richard and Krantz, 1991; Casas et al., 2001). The
main difference is that the prime motivation of our analogue
modelling was not to theoretical address the study of the implicated
deformation regimes (e.g. simple shear, transpression), but instead, to
use the obtained experimental results instrumentally, i.e., to compare
them with the natural structures to try to quantify the strain involved
in their formation. Another important difference is that we focused in
the formation of ductile structures, rather than brittle ones, to try to
understand the way through which a soft sedimentary cover,
comprising poorly or even unconsolidated sediments, endures
deformation under the referred conditions.

3.1. First set of experiments: basement strike-slip faulting and coupled
shear deformation

3.1.1. Experimental procedure
In the first set of experiments we used a Perspex strike-slip

deformation rig (Fig. 6) with dimensions of 50×25×5 cm, comprising
two confining vertical walls and two basal, laterally juxtaposed, rigid
plates, moving relatively to each other in opposite directions, driven at
constant velocity (~0.028 mm s?1) by an electric motor.

The materials used as analogues of the soft cover seafloor
sediments include: (1) Dry quartz sand (grain sizeb0.25 mm) with
negligible cohesion and a friction angle of about 30° to simulate brittle
sedimentary layers (e.g. Hubbert, 1951; Horsfield, 1977); (2) Trans-
parent silicone putty (PDMS, a polydimethyl-siloxane, manufactured
by Dow Corning of Great Britain under the trade name SGM 36) as an
analogue of weak layers within the upper crust (see Weijermars
1986a,b,c for PDMS properties), simulating the deformation behaviour
of natural sedimentary rocks such as shales, clays or salt (e.g. Ballard
et al., 1987; Vendeville et al., 1987; Richard et al., 1989, 1991; Marques
and Coelho, 2001; Rosas et al., 2001, 2002). In some experiments a
mixture of dry sand and a fraction of mortar (~40%) was also used to
increase the cohesiveness of the material (measured internal friction
angle around 35°), and thus improve the simulated reproduction of
brittle structures in the model (e.g. Hampel et al., 2004).

To simulate passive deformation of a sedimentary cover above a
basement strike-slip fault system, we constructed an initial model (see
Fig. 6) in which the rigid basement is represented by the basal Perspex
plates. These are overlain by a 1 cm thick silicone layer, corresponding
to the approximately 1 km thickness of the Plio-Quaternary sedimen-
tary cover (scale?1/100.000). In most experiments a two-layered
silicone-sand cake with the same total thickness was used instead, with
the intention of monitoring the generation of brittle structures in the
sand layers, as well as the ones expected to form in the silicone. The
surface between the silicone layer and the basal rigid plates is non-
lubricated, promoting total adherence between them. The relative
opposite movement of the plates simulates dextral strike-slip along a
pre-existent basement fault plane, transmitting this movement to the
overlying silicone and sand layers. Square grids, straight lines and
circles were drawn on top of the model surface to be used as passive
strain markers. The dimensions of the deformation rig are sufficiently
large to guarantee that the bulk of the model is not affected by
boundary effects. The experiments were repeated several times to
ensure the consistency of the obtained results, and top view photo-
graphs were taken at regular time intervals.

3.1.2. Experimental results
In the cover silicone-sand layers of our model, the strike-slip

basement faulting was mostly accommodated through the develop-
ment of different types of brittle and ductile structures (Figs. 7A, B
and 8).

The obtained brittle structures are dominant in the sand (sand-
mortar) layers and comprise mainly (inset of Fig. 8): a) Oblique
synthetic Riedel shears (R), orientated at low angles to the bulk shear
direction (15°–20° for the first increments of deformation); b)
Synthetic P shears which originate at the tips of R shears also at low
angles to the shear direction (10°–15°); c) Few antithetic Riedel shears
(R') at high angles (70°–75°) with the bulk shear direction; and d) Few
tension gashes or extension fractures (T) at original 45° to the shear
direction.

Ductile structures also developed in the sand layers, but were
clearly dominant in the silicone cover layers of our models (lower
right photos of Fig. 7A and B), consisting in sets of en-échelon folds,
originally formed at 45° to the shear direction, and progressively
rotating towards it as shear strain (?) increased. In the sand layers, the
en-échelon folds are also pervasively cut by an anastomosing grid of
synthetic Riedels (R) and P shears (Figs. 7A and 8).

3.2. Second set of experiments: low-angle transpression

3.2.1. Experimental procedure
As mentioned above, we carried out this second set of experiments

essentially to be able to monitor the type of morphotectonic patterns
that are expected to form under dextral, low-angle, transpression,
affecting soft cover sediments along a narrow shear band. To do so we
used a transpressive deformation rig (Fig. 9) comprising two lateral
(vertical) walls, moving relatively to each other in opposite directions
on top of a fixed (horizontal) basal rigid plate. The walls are driven by
a motor connected to a pair of long screws, pushing them along a
direction making a horizontal angle of 15° with the shear direction, at
the constant velocity of approximately 0.028 mm s?1.

We employed the same materials with the same properties
described for the first set of experiments: dry sand as an analogue
of upper crust brittle behaviour, and transparent silicone putty
(PDMS) to simulate week layers of the upper crust soft sedimentary
cover. Similarly to what was described for the first set of experiments,
a sand-mortar mixture was also some times used to favour the
reproduction of brittle structures.

The constructed initial model consisted in a 1 cm-thick layered
silicone-sand cake (Fig. 9) corresponding to the scaled estimated
thickness of the Plio-Quaternary sedimentary cover (?1:100,000). It
should be noted that in this case the basal Perspex plate does not
represent an analogue of the Mesozoic basement rocks, since we



39F.M. Rosas et al. / Marine Geology 261 (2009) 33–47
focused exclusively on the low-angle transpressive shearing affecting
the cover.

Total free slip was achieved along the contact surface of the basal
Perspex plate with the silicone layer, by lubricating it with neutral
soap. Conversely, the contact surface between the silicone layer and
the vertical moving walls was non-lubricated, promoting a total
adherence of the silicone to these walls. Straight lines and circles were
drawn on top of the model surface to be used as passive strain
markers. Experiments were repeated several times, and top view
photographs were obtain at regular intervals.

3.2.2. Experimental results
In these experiments (Fig.10A and B) synthetic Riedels (R) also formed

at a low angle to the bulk shear direction, but neither in the silicone layer,
nor in the sand-mortar one, did any set of en-échelon folds developed.
Instead, in early stages (Fig. 10A), a central elongated bulge formed,
consisting in two aligned asymmetric fold segments, trending parallel to
the bulk shear direction, and bounded at both sides by incipient, opposite
directed, early thrusts. For higher amounts of shortening and lateral
displacement (Fig. 10B), synthetic R shears continued to form, and the
folded bulged band narrowed as folds got tighter and thrusts developed.

LAB-PSS#050915 and LAB-PSS#050916).

4. Comparison of the experimental results with the
natural examples

For both sets of experiments the obtained brittle structural
patterns recorded in the sand cover layers are similar, consisting
essentially in the more or less pervasive development of synthetic R
and P shears (see Figs. 7 and 10). Conversely, the ductile patterns,
comprising the development of folds both in sand and silicone layers,
are clearly different, depending on which set of experiments is
considered: for strike-slip basement faulting and coupled passive
shearing, an en-échelon fold pattern was obtained (see Fig. 7A and B),
whereas for low-angle transpression a totally different pattern of folds
formed (see Fig. 10).

In the first case, the experimentally obtained structural pattern
correlates well with the en-échelon spatial distribution of bathymetric
crests associated with L1 (Fig. 11A and B), which suggests that this
corresponds to a morphotectonic pattern formed passively in the
seafloor soft sediments, as the result of dominant right-lateral strike-
slip reactivation of the underlying basement fault.

For the second set of experiments the obtained structural pattern
resembles more the morphology characterizing L2 (Fig. 11C),
suggesting an origin preferably related with low-angle dextral

transpressive shearing along a narrow band nucleated by the
reactivation of the underlying fault.

For both sets of experiments, the obtained structural patterns
correlate with the natural examples, only when the ductile deforma-
tion output is considered. Both L1 and L2 lack any kind of associated
brittle structures, such as the R or P shears that formed in the analogue
models. This shows that the deformation which originated the natural
morphotectonic patterns was essentially ductile, affecting poorly
lithified soft sediments of Recent age.

Note that it was not possible to compare the obtained experi-
mental results with L3 and L4 lineaments, because L3 is hardly
recognizable in the bathymetry, and deformation associated with L4 is
probably masked by the local wrinkled seafloor morphology (corre-
sponding to the accretionary wedge domain, AW in Figs. 1B and 2).

4.1. Structural analysis

In our first set of experiments the en-échelon folds were observed
to form and rotate closely to what is theoretically predicted for passive
strain markers in simple shear progressive deformation. In this
deformation regime, shear strain (?) is defined as the ratio between
the displacement parallel to the shear direction (?x) and the width of
rike-slip faulting and coupled shear deformation, (A) using a silicone-sand layered cake
top layer corresponding to a sand-mortar mixture (LAB-PSS#050915, initial state in

the shear zone (Y) (Fig. 12A). A classical strain maker corresponds to
the strain ellipse of Ramsay and Huber (1983), which in simple shear
forms instantaneously, for infinitesimal increments of shear strain,
with its longest axis at an angle (?) at 45° to the shear plane (Fig.12B).
As ? shear strain accumulates, the axial ratio of the strain ellipse
increases and its longest axis rotates towards the shear plane, with
consequent reduction of the angular ? value (Fig. 12B). This behaviour
can be simply described in terms of the relation between ? and ?, as in
the equation presented by Ramsay and Graham (1970) (see Eq. (1)
below, and Fig. 12B). Accordingly, our experimental results show that,
for infinitesimal deformation increments, the en-échelon folds formed
with their hinges approximately parallel to the e1 principal axis of the
instantaneous strain ellipse, at an angle of ??45° to the shear plane
(Fig. 12C), and rotated towards it during the progressive non-coaxial
deformation, as ? shear strain increased. This similarity between the
observed experimental behaviour of the en-échelon folds and
the theoretical prediction for simple shear deformation, is shown
by the good correlation that exists between the points corresponding
to the measurements made for ? and ? in the succeeding progressive
deformation stages of the several experiments done, and the equation
curve of Ramsay and Graham (1970) (Fig.12D). This correlation shows
that the en-échelon folds obtained in our first set of experiments
formed under deformation conditions similar to bulk simple shear, and
hence, given the comparison with the natural examples presented
above, that the same would also apply to the L1 bathymetric lineament
and associated natural en-échelon folds.
Based on this deduction, measuring the mean value of ? (=24.20°)
in the natural en-échelon folds of L1 lineament (see Fig. 11B) made it
possible to determine the approximate amount of shear strain (?) that
originated these structures in their present orientation. This was done
using equation

? =
2

tan2?
; ð1Þ

(Ramsay and Graham, 1970) in which ?=24.20° gives ?=1.78.
Furthermore, using this ? value and the mean width of the L1

shear zone Y (~4000 m), which was estimated based on the observed
spatial distribution of the en-échelon folds (see Fig. 11B), it was also
possible to determine the along strike displacement (?x) implied in
the shear deformation responsible for the present orientation of the
en-échelon folds. This was done using equation

? = tg Wð Þ = ?x
Y

; ð2Þ

of Ramsay and Huber (1983), in which for ?=1.78 and Y=4000 m,
we obtain ?x?7000 m.

In our second set of experiments, concerning the L2 lineament and
associated deformation pattern, the absence of natural structures
useful as reliable (i.e. measurable) strain markers, did not allow a
more quantitative insight, regarding strain quantification of the
transpressive shearing, through comparison between the observa-
tions and the experimental results.

4.2. Age of the deformation associated to the L1 morphotectonic pattern

According to the recently reported kinematic models for the Gulf of
Cadiz computed from geodetic data (e.g. Nocquet and Calais, 2004; Stich

et al., 2006; Fernandes et al., 2007), the ongoing convergence between
Nubia and Iberia occurs along a WNW–ESE direction, subparallel to the
shear direction associated to L1, at a rate of approximately 4 mm/yr (see
inset in Fig. 1B). Thus, by considering the value of the along strike

displacement(?x?7000 m) obtained above, and the reported 4 mm/yr
convergence rate, it was possible to estimate the maximum age of 1.8 Ma
for the deformation responsible for the L1 morphotectonic pattern. This
estimate is based on the assumption that the cover sediments recording
this pattern are soft (poorly lithified), deforming mostly in a ductile
manner, which suggests a simultaneous character of sedimentation and
strain. In accordance, the syntectonic sedimentation rate would be of
critical influence on the nucleation and development of the L1
structures, since relatively larger sedimentation rates would tend to
attenuate the morphologic expression of the developing structures.
Therefore, the well preserved L1 morphotectonic patterns seemingly
suggest low syntectonic sedimentation rates, which agrees with the
average 30 cm/Ky (0.3 mm/y) reported by Lebreiro et al. (1997) for the
horseshoe abyssal plain.

5. Summary and conclusions

Based on our experimental results, and on the bathymetry and
seismic reflection data presented above, we conclude that: (1) In the
Gulf of Cadiz, the WNW-ESE lineaments correspond to the bathy-
metric expression of active deep seated faults; (2) These faults show a
Present day kinematics consisting in bulk dextral wrenching; (3) The
deformation which originated the study morphotectonic lineaments
started at a maximum age of ca. 1.8 Ma. (4) These lineaments formed



46 F.M. Rosas et al. / Marine Geology 261 (2009) 33–47
in soft, most probably, poorly consolidated sediments, deposited at
relatively low rates of syntectonic sedimentation.

Our results show that the morphotectonic pattern associated to L1
was formed as a consequence of dextral strike-slip reactivation of a
basement fault, coupled with passive simple shear deformation of
the overlying soft sedimentary cover. On other hand, the seafloor
bathymetry pattern associated to L2 must have formed preferably as a
consequence of low-angle dextral transpression. However, in this case,
the uncertainty concerning the local upper crust vertical rheology
profile, did not allow a better comprehension of the process governing
the nucleation of a transpressive shear band in the soft sedimentary
cover overlying the correspondent fault. Moreover, since no natural
structural features useful as strain gauges were found in this case, a
more quantitative insight was also impossible to achieve. It should be
noted that L1 borders the northern–eastern flank of the CPR (Figs. 1B,
2 and 3), which could correspond to a rigid body resisting shortening
and favouring lateral slip, instead of transpressive shearing, along this
limit.

5.1. Tectonic implications

In the Gulf of Cadiz, the faults associated to the studied lineaments
were previously reported to have endured a complex tectonic
evolution from Early Mesozoic through Cenozoic (Terrinha et al.,
under review). Based on the inspected seismic profiles (see Figs. 4 and
5), it was in some cases possible to recognize a kinematic behaviour
characterized by reverse faulting. These faults cut through the
Mesozoic and the base of the Tortonian chaotic body, but do not
affect the top of this unit, neither the overlying sediments which are
generally sealing these structures (see Figs. 4 and 5). This shows that
the reverse fault kinematics is not presently active.

Our conclusions fit the whole-scale strain partitioning scenario,
recently proposed by Terrinha et al. (under review), according to
which the Nubia–Iberia collision in the Gulf of Cadiz area is Presently
being accommodated through oblique westwards thrusting along
NNE–SSW faults, such as the Horseshoe fault and Marques de Pombal
active faults (see Fig. 1B), and simultaneously through bulk dextral
strike-slip reactivation of pre-existent WNW–ESE faults, correspond-
ing to the studied bathymetric lineaments. According to our experi-
mental results, the age of this deformation recorded by Recent bottom
floor soft sediments in the Gulf of Cadiz is ca. 1.8 Ma (late Pliocene).
Furthermore, given the WNW–ESE trend of the faults their interpreted
kinematic behaviour is in good agreement with the kinematic models
derived from geodetic data yielding a 4 mm/yr convergence rate,
subparallel that same direction.

Abstract 

 

 Analogue and numerical modeling was carried out to test the existence of 

tectonic interference between major active strike-slip and thrust faults intersecting each 

other in the Gulf of Cadiz (Africa-Eurasia plate boundary, offshore SW Iberia). The 

obtained results show that newly mapped tectonic structures located in the fault 

intersection area (corner zone) consist mostly in oblique (dextral-reverse) faults that 

comply with a preferred stress-strain concentration in that location, caused by thrust-

wrench tectonic interference. In view of these results, a multi-rupture scenario can be 

envisaged from comparison with the natural example, showing the need to carefully 

considered seismic-related hazards of low to moderate seismicity (up to M7) in the Gulf 

of Cadiz area. Moreover, the recognized depth discrepancy between the (upper crust) 

interference fault-pattern and the (lithospheric mantle) seismicity is interpreted as 

mailto:frosas@fc.ul.pt


suggestive of a decoupled manifestation of the same thrust-wrench tectonic interference 

at different lithospheric depths.

1. Introduction 

 

 The Gulf of Cadiz (Fig. 1A) has long been considered a key domain to unravel 

the complex tectonics of the Eurasia-Africa plate boundary. It corresponds to a specific 

segment of this boundary characterized by the interplay between the Iberia and Nubia 

subplates, connecting the (Atlantic) transform Gloria Fault, in the West, with the dextral 

transpressive Rif-Tell shear zone (Morel and Meghraoui, 1996) to the East of Gibraltar 

Straits, and across the Betic-Rif orogenic arc. In the Gulf of Cadiz domain, the Iberia - 

Núbia plate boundary has been considered of a diffuse nature (Sartori et al., 1994; 

Medialdea et al., 2004), since a Present day WNW-ESE convergence between both 

plates at a  ~ 4-5mm/yr  rate, (e.g. Nocquet and Calais, 2004; Stich et al., 2006; 

Fernandes et al., 2007; Serpelloni et al., 2007, gray line in the inset of Fig. 1B) is here 

accommodated by a considerable number of widespread and differently orientated 

active tectonic structures, mostly exhibiting strike-slip and thrust fault kinematics (Fig. 

1B). During the last decade, the systematic interpretation of acquired geophysical data 

(e.g. reflection/refraction seismics and multi-beam swath bathymetry) led to the 

progressive discover of several new tectonic features, resulting in the continuous 

upgrade of the Gulf of Cadiz tectonic map (see Fig. 1B, Gràcia et al., 2003a,b; Terrinha 



et al., 2003; Zitellini et al., 2004; Rosas et al., 2009; Terrinha et al., 2009; Zitellini et al., 

2009; Duarte et al., 2009, 2010). 

 The seismicity that has been recorded in the Gulf of Cadiz corresponds to a 

general scenario of moderate magnitude at shallow to intermediate depths (e.g. Fukao, 

1973; Grimison and Chen, 1986; Buforn et al., 1995; Engdahl et al, 1998; Borges et al., 

2001; Buforn et al., 2004; Stich et al., 2005), in which a direct correlation between 

earthquake location and known major tectonic structures is not straightforward. Large 

magnitude events also exist, such as the 28/02/1969 earthquake (Ms=7.9), and more 

noticeably the highly destructive 1755 Great Lisbon Earthquake (estimated magnitude 

between 8.5 and 8.8, e.g. Abe, 1979; Johnston, 1996; Solares and Arroyo, 2004), and 

associated tsunami (e.g. Baptista et al., 1998a,b; Zitellini et al., 2001; Terrinha et al., 

2003; Baptista and Miranda, 2009). In addition, recent studies confirm higher depths for 

low-magnitude local earthquakes (40-60 km, Geissler et al., 2010), highlighting the 

relevance of seismogenic mantle rheology and deep lithospheric structures, 

complementary to the known (i.e. mapped) shallower crustal faults. The potential 

seismic hazard posed by the high magnitude earthquakes continuously triggers the 

interest, and the need, for determining their seismogenic (and tsunamigenic) sources, 

and hence to better understand the tectonic evolution of the region.  

 

1.1. Tectonic setting 

  

 In the Gulf of Cadiz tectonic map of figure 1B three main sets of major 

structures can be recognized: 1) The frontal thrust that bounds the so called Gulf of 

Cadiz Accretionary Wedge (GCAW, in the eastern half of the study area, Fig. 1B); 2) a 

set of NE-SW striking thrust-faults, preferably located to the West of the Horseshoe 



Valley (e.g. Horseshoe Thrust Fault, Marquês de Pombal Fault, Gorringe Fault); and 3) 

a set of WNW-ESE dextral strike-slip faults, corresponding to the SWIM wrench 

system, as defined by Zitellini et al. (2009). According to these authors, the later system 

corresponds to a broad deformation band extending across the whole of the Gulf of 

Cadiz domain (along 600 km), essentially characterized by sets of major deep seated, 

sub-vertical, dextral strike-slip faults: the SWIM faults (see Fig. 1B), which are thought 

to be active since at least ~1.8 My (Rosas et al., 2009). Noting the fact that these faults 

strike subparallel to the Present day convergence direction between Nubia and Iberia 

(WNW-ESE, see gray line in the inset of Fig. 1B), Zitellini et al. (2009) interpreted this 

SWIM Fault Zone as a precursor of a new (dextral) transcurrent plate boundary in the 

Gulf of Cadiz area. Apart from the GCAW, which Present day activeness and tectonic 

significance is still intensively debated (Gutscher et al., 2002; Gràcia et al., 2003a,b; 

Terrinha et al., 2003, 2009; Gutscher, 2004; Zitellini et al., 2004, 2009; Gutscher et al., 

2009a,b), the other most important active structure intersected by one of the SWIM 

faults is the Horseshoe Thrust Fault (HTF - see Fig. 1B). Together with the Marquês de 

Pombal Fault (MPF) this Northwest directed thrust was previously proposed as a 

possible seismogenic source of the 1755 Lisbon Earthquake (Gràcia et al., 2003a,b; 

Terrinha et al., 2003), and corresponds to one of the most unequivocal active structures 

in this domain since Tortonian times (at least ~10My, e.g. Gràcia et al., 2003a,b; 

Zitellini et al., 2004; Terrinha et al., 2009). 

 

1.2 Present work 

  

 If the SWIM 1 fault is part of a set of major active strike-slip structures 

delineating the onset of a new (dextral) transcurrent plate boundary, and if these same 



structures intersect others such as the Horseshoe Thrust Fault also recognized as active, 

some kind of tectonic interference is expected to occur as a consequence. In the present 

work, analogue and 3D finite element numerical modeling experiments were carried out 

to understand the structural pattern that develops in a competent brittle medium (e.g. 

upper crust) as a result of the mechanical interference between a dominant right-lateral 

strike-slip fault, accounting for the Present day dextral transcurrent SWIM system 

(Zitellini et al., 2009), and a thrust fault complying with the also active, west-directed, 

Horseshoe thrust fault (see Fig. 1B). Model results were thoroughly compared with the 

natural example, and ensuing implications for its overall tectonic evolution explored 

and evaluated. 

  

2. Morphotectonic characterization of the study fault-systems 

 

 The area studied in detail in the present work is limited by the dash-lined 

rectangle in figure 1B, which bathymetry and correspondent tectonic interpretation is 

depicted in figures 2 and 3, respectively. The newly proposed tectonic map of figure 3B 

corresponds mostly to the area of intersection between the Horseshoe thrust and the 

SWIM 1 faults, and it was investigated through the detailed combined analysis of the 

available multi-beam swath bathymetry (SWIM compilation, Zitellini et al., 2009), and  

a series of multi-channel seismic (MCS) reflection profiles, acquired during several 

different surveys (Fig. 3A; ARRIFANO – Arco Rifano, IAM - Iberian Atlantic Margin 

and SWIM – South West Iberian Margin, Sartori et al., 1994; Banda et al., 1995; 

Tortella et al., 1997; Martinez-Loriente et al., 2008). A detailed morphological 

characterization of the NW Gulf of Cadiz domain, and its several different sub-domains, 

was recently presented by Terrinha et al. (2009). Concurring with their proposal, the 



main large-scale bathymetric features in the study area are here interpreted as being 

tectonically controlled by the activity of the recognized major fault-systems (described 

below, see Figs. 2 and 3). 

 Based on the seismic reflection dataset available, a general seismostratigraphy 

was also previously established for this domain (e.g. Sartori et al., 1994; Torelli et al., 

1997; Tortella et al., 1997; Terrinha et al., 2009; Duarte et al., 2010) comprising (Figs. 4 

and 5): a) A basal Mesozoic (Jurassic-Cretaceous) unit (~2 s twt) corresponding to 

carbonate sediments; b) A Late Miocene ?chaotic body? unit (~1.5 s twt) with a semi-

chaotic seismic signature, previously interpreted as an olistostrome body or as a tectonic 

mélange (Torelli et al., 1997; Tortella et al., 1997; Terrinha et al., 2009; Iribarren et al., 

2007); and  c) A top Late Miocene to Plio-Quaternary unit (?0.5 s twt), corresponding 

to a hemipelagic sedimentary cover. 

   

2.1. Horseshoe Thrust Fault 

 

 The NE-SW trending HTF scarp is clearly observed in the bathymetry (Fig. 2A 

and B), displaying a maximum height of ca. 1000 m in its north-easternmost segment, 

gradually vanishing towards SW (Fig. 2 and 3). The SE half of the study area (mostly 

coinciding with the Horseshoe Valley at depths between -4200m and -4800m – see Fig. 

2) is interpreted to correspond to the hanging wall of the NW directed Horseshoe Thrust 

Fault (e.g. Tortella et al., 1997; Zitellini et al., 2004;Terrinha et al., 2009), tectonically 

uplifted relatively to its footwall, which corresponds to the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain 

(HAP) in the NW half of the study area (at depths always greater than -4800 m). In the 

IAM4e profile (Figs. 4) the HTF (around shot point 1000 in Fig. 4) is clearly imaged as 

a SE dipping, deep seated fault. It roots well into the Mesozoic unit, prolonging 



upwards across all the other overlying units, and breaching out at the sea-floor surface, 

where a resulting prominent deformation is marked by an offset of ca. 420 m (~0.6s twt 

in the IAM4e profile). The NW directed thrusting kinematics is clearly shown by the 

geometry of the folds affecting the Mesozoic reflectors near the fault plane, and by the 

unambiguous offset of the surface marking the top of the Mesozoic unit (see Fig. 4). To 

the SE of the HTF other relatively minor thrusts affecting the basal Mesozoic unit were 

previously described (e.g. Terrinha et al., 2009; Duarte et al., 2010), although these only 

affect the base of the overlying Late Miocene chaotic body (see Fig. 4).  The same 

authors also report some degree of tectonic imbrication within the Miocene chaotic 

body further to SE, only mildly perturbing the sea-floor morphology. 

 

2.2. SWIM 1 fault 

 

 The SWIM system was previously described by Zitellini et al. (2009) as 

corresponding to a set of WNW-ESE trending, vertical right-lateral strike-slip faults, 

characterized by a hundred-kilometer long linear bathymetric expression, ranging from 

the foots of the Gorringe Bank, in the West Gulf of Cadiz, across the HAP, the 

Horseshoe Valley and the GCAW, reaching its easternmost area near the Straits of 

Gibraltar (see Fig. 1B). The SWIM 1 fault (Figs. 1, 2 and 3) is crossed both by the 

IAM4 and the IAM3 seismic profiles (Fig. 5), where it can be observed to correspond to 

a deep-seated sub-vertical fault. It cuts across all the main seismostratigraphic units, 

occasionally breaching out, and it roots in the lower pre-Mesozoic (?) basement. Some 

segments of the fault exhibit an overall geometry resembling flower-like structures (Fig. 

5B), agreeing with the previously proposed transcurrent kinematics (Duarte et al., 2009; 

Terrinha, et al., 2009; Zitellini, et al., 2009). 



 

2.3. The new corner zone tectonic framework 

 

 The SWIM 1 fault intersects the Horseshoe thrust near its SW termination (Figs. 

2 and 3). In the HAP, away from the HTF, the SWIM 1 lineament is not prominently 

recorded in the bathymetry, although the continuation of the correspondent basement 

strike-slip fault was thoroughly mapped further to the West, until the foothills of the 

Gorringe Bank, flanking its south-western termination (see Figs. 1B and 3B, Duarte et 

al., 2009; Terrinha et al., 2009). Interpretation of the available seismic dataset in this 

specific area (see Fig. 3A) led for the first time to the recognition of a new tectonic 

configuration (see map of Fig. 3B) comprising other faults – e.g. CF1 and CF2 - located 

near the intersection (corner zone) between the SWIM 1 strike-slip and the Horseshoe 

thrust, and also lacking any significant morphological expression in the HAP sea-floor 

(Fig. 3B and 5). In the IAM4 profile it is possible to observe that these corner faults 

correspond to steep (southwards) dipping faults, rooting in the basement underneath the 

Mesozoic unit and cutting across the overlying units, including the base of the Late 

Miocene to Plio-Quaternay top unit (see Fig. 5). In the case of CF1 the sea-floor surface 

is also perturbed (around sp 4840 in IAM4 profile, and black arrow in Figs. 2 and 3B), 

whereas CF2 lacks any kind of bathymetric expression. In the IAM4 profile a reverse-

fault component of movement along both CF1 and CF2 faults is apparent, revealed 

namely by the offset of the upper limit of the Mesozoic unit across these faults that 

clearly denounces the upward movement of the respective SE fault blocks (see Fig. 5). 

Since the faults are highly steep, a pure dip-slip thrusting movement is mechanically 

implausible in this situation. In contrast, oblique-slip faults, characterized by a 



fundamentally dextral transcurrent kinematics and a minor thrusting component, would 

mechanically adequate to the observed structural geometry. 

 Adding to this structural evidence, recently proposed relocation of low to 

moderate magnitude earthquakes in the study area (Geissler et al., 2010), showed the 

existence of two clusters, concentrating near the northern and southern terminations of 

the HTF (Fig. 6, Geissler et al., 2010). The southern cluster coincides with the SWIM 1- 

HTF corner zone area, and exhibits a WNW-ESE general trend parallel to the SWIM 1 

fault. It should be noted that most of these hypocenters are located at relatively high 

depths (40-55 km), probably in the lithospheric mantle (Geissler et al., 2010; Sallarès et 

al., 2011), and thus cannot be directly linked to the faults imaged by the MCS profiles at 

upper crustal levels (maximum depths of ca.6km; see discussion below in section 5). 

Nevertheless, the reported corresponding focal mechanisms solutions in this corner zone 

domain show significant heterogeneity, possibly due to varied fault orientation, but 

generally accounting for dominant reverse and strike-slip faulting (Geissler et al., 2010). 

 These tectonic and seismic corner-zone manifestations are here hypothetically 

considered to have formed as the result of a particular type of thrust-wrench tectonic 

interference between the Horseshoe and the SWIM systems at different depths. The 

upper-crust fault interference between the SWIM1 dextral strike-slip and the HTF is 

expected to provide some insight on the causes for the recorded seismicity at higher 

(mantle) depths, and is thus investigated and tested through the analogue and numerical 

modeling experiments presented below. 

 

3. Analogue modeling 

 



 Analogue modeling experiments of separated wrench systems (e.g. Mandl et al., 

1977; Richard et al., 1991; Dooley and McClay, 1997; McClay and Bonora, 2001; 

Schopfer and Steyrer, 2001; Le Guerroue and Cobbold, 2006) and thrust systems (e.g. 

Malavieille,  1984; Mulugeta, 1988; Lallemand et al., 1994; Gutscher et al., 1998a,b; 

Agarwal and Agarwal 2002; Lohrmann et al., 2003; Ellis et al., 2004; McClay et al., 

2004; Bonnet et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2007; Malavieille, 2010) are common and well 

documented. Conversely, physical modeling dealing with the deformation caused by 

simultaneous thrusting and wrenching is less common, and generally focused on a 

variety of different specific aspects (e.g. Diraison et al., 2000; Di Bucci et al 2006, 

2007). Hence the present work, in which sand-box analogue models were produced to 

better understand the deformation patterns resulting from thrust-wrench fault 

interference under the specific conditions of the study area.    

 

3.1. Experimental method 

 

3.1.1. Material properties and scaling  

 Experiments were done using dry quartz sand which properties are summarized 

in Table 1. Sand is considered a Coulomb material deforming in a brittle way according 

to the Coulomb fracture criterion (e.g. Hubbert, 1937, 1951; Davis et al., 1983, 

Appendix A), and it has been extensively used in scaled model experiments simulating 

brittle deformation in the upper crust or other lithospheric competent levels. Since 

brittle deformation is time independent while inertial acceleration is negligible, scaling 

was achieved through classically considering model-prototype ratios of fundamental 

units (Hubbert, 1937), only for mass (through density) and length (?=Lmod/Lprot=5x10
-6

 



or 1/200.000). All the assumed model - prototype ratios are presented in Table 1, and 

the detailed procedure of scaling is specified in Appendix A.  

 

3.1.2. Apparatus, initial stage and procedure  

 All the experiments were carried out in the 100 x 60 cm Perspex deformation 

box depicted in figure 7. The box consists in two horizontal 1cm thick basal plates 

(plates A and B in Fig. 7) that move relatively to each other along the X direction, 

simulating a right-lateral strike-slip (basement) fault. A thin metal sheet attached to the 

base of a backstop is moved by a stepping motor also along the X direction, sliding on 

top of both basal plates (Fig. 7A). The front of this metal sheet works as a velocity 

discontinuity (VD) at an angle of 60º/120º with the direction of the strike-slip fault (X 

direction). Two fixed lateral vertical walls confine the whole system. In the initial stage, 

a layered sand cake was mounted inside the box on top of the intersection between the 

basal strike-slip fault and the velocity discontinuity (Fig. 7B). This was achieved by 

pouring batches of differently colored sand from a moving elongated funnel (with a 

width matching the 60cm of the box), guarantying the leveling of its top surface. In 

most experiments the sand cake thickness was 3cm (corresponding to 6 km in nature), 

although in several experiments thickness of 4 and 5 cm (8 and 10 km) were also 

considered. Layering in the sand cake has no correspondence with any natural 

structures, and was used merely as a 3D strain marker, since in the end-stage of all the 

experiments the deformed sand cake was humidified, and several slices were serially cut 

along different chosen orientations. Likewise, parallel (or sometimes square) line grids 

were also imprinted on the top surface of the model to serve as (2D) passive strain 

markers. In the present modeling the driving kinematics was conceived to correspond to 

the basal right-lateral strike-slip faulting, concurring with the natural example where the 



dextral SWIM faults are observed to strike subparallel to the Present day convergence 

between Iberia and Nubia as shown by the reported geodetic data (e.g. Nocquet and 

Calais, 2004; Stich et al., 2006; Fernandes et al., 2007; Serpelloni et al., 2007, see gray 

line in the inset of Fig. 1B). In accordance, all the experiments comprised the following 

two successive steps (see Fig. 7A):  

 

1) A very brief preliminary one that consisted in moving the backstop (and the 

attached thin metal sheet) along the X direction to the left, only until few thrusts 

were observed to have formed breaching out at the top surface of the sand cake. 

This was done merely to produce an initial planar week anisotropy representing 

the original geometry of the HTF system, at an angle of 60/120º with the basal 

(SWIM) strike-slip direction. 

  

2) A second one that consisted in moving the basal plates relatively to each other 

(also along X), by pushing the furthest plate (basal plate A) to the right (see Fig. 

7A), producing a right-lateral strike-slip movement along the vertical contact 

surface between both basal plates, simulating the (SWIM 1) basement vertical 

strike-slip fault.   

 

During step 2, the central (?corner zone?) domain of basal plate A was limited by two 

main kinematically active boundaries: one corresponding to the trace of the basal strike-

slip fault, and the other to the velocity discontinuity (see Fig. 7A). Since the dextral 

strike-slip along the contact with plate B was accomplished by moving plate A to the 

right, the boundary between this plate and the over-sliding thin metal sheet (velocity 

discontinuity) corresponded to a convergent limit between the sand above basal plate A, 



and the sand sitting on top of the thin metal sheet (edged by the velocity discontinuity). 

Thus, the driving forces for deformation in the sand came from the relative movement 

between the sliding basal plates and the thin metal sheet, which were both in frictional 

contact with the overlying sand. As result, during the second experimental step, the sand 

cake on top of the boundary between both basal plates endured dextral wrenching 

deformation, whereas simultaneously shortening accommodated by thrusting occurred 

in the sand above the velocity discontinuity. Stepping motors were used to move both 

the backstop and the basal plates at a constant velocity (~20cm/hr). The dimensions of 

the deformation box were sufficiently large to guarantee that the bulk of the model was 

not affected by boundary effects, and experiments were repeated several times to ensure 

the consistency of the obtained results. Besides photos of serially cut sections of the 

(end-stage) deformed models, top view photographs were also taken at regular time 

intervals as the experiments unfolded.    

 

3.2. Experimental results 

 

 The main obtained results are depicted in figures 8 and 9. During the first 

experimental step a pop-up structure always formed, bounded by a pair of opposite ~30º 

dipping (fore and back) thrusts, rooting in the velocity discontinuity (Fig. 8A1). During 

the second experimental step, different types of structures were simultaneously formed 

in the different areas of the model analyzed below. 

 

3.2.1. Thrust-front and wrenching domains 

In the area in front of the main thrust and relatively away from the corner zone 

(thrust-front domain depicted in Fig.8), the incremental accumulation of shortening 



resulting from moving basal plate A to the right could no longer be exclusively 

accommodated by the original pair of thrusts (forethrust and backthrust) formed during 

experimental step1 (Fig. 8A1), and thus new forethrusts were successively formed (Fig. 

8A2-A3 and B-C). As is classically the case in these type of experiments (e.g. Bonini et 

al., 2000; Persson and Sokoutis, 2002; Lohrmann et al., 2003; Maillot and Koyi, 2006; 

Koyi and Maillot, 2007) each new thrust rooted in the VD and accommodated a certain 

amount of shortening, before being transported along the backthrust fault plane when a 

newer forethrust was formed, leading to the end-term situation depicted in figure 9B 

(cross section 6). 

 Simultaneously, in the sand cake above the basal strike-slip fault (wrenching 

domain as defined in figure 8), the first formed structures were en-échelon Riedel faults 

(Riedel, 1929, R-faults in Fig. 8A2) orientated at low angles to the basement strike-slip 

direction (15° to 20° for the first increments of deformation). Between these, several P-

faults also developed. Offset of parallel lines on model surface by R and P faults 

showed a synthetic (dextral) strike-slip component of movement along these structures. 

Further strike-slip increments (Fig. 8A3) originated Y-faults that formed parallel to the 

basement fault direction, cut the early R and P-faults, and also exhibited dextral strike-

slip kinematics. As shear strain accumulated, the surface area between the R-faults rose 

significantly (compare the topography of Figs. 8A2 and A3) originating a deformation 

band parallel to the basement fault with a characteristic surface morphology, comprising 

several sub-parallel elongated bulges (see Fig. 8A3). Subsequent strike-slip increments 

mostly produced a continued reduction of the width of the previously formed 

deformation band, besides the amplification of its relief. In cross sections cut 

perpendicular to the deformation band (Fig. 9 – cross sections 1 and 2) the observed 

overall fault pattern corresponded to an upwards splaying from the basement fault, 



typically defining a flower structure. Within this, R-faults exhibited in some degree a 

reverse component of movement, in line with an oblique (dextral-reverse) kinematics, 

although in the complete absence of any externally induced compression. These 

structures are typical of wrench fault systems, and confirm previous standard modeling 

results (e.g. Mandl et al., 1977; Richard et al., 1991; Dooley and McClay, 1997; 

McClay and Bonora, 2001; Schopfer and Steyrer, 2001; Le Guerroue and Cobbold, 

2006). Specifically, the occurrence of oblique dextral-reverse kinematics along 

helicoidal R-faults in the absence of any externally induced compression, was 

previously explained as a result of 5-10% of dilatation in the sand, which is also thought 

to occur in similar degree in brittle natural rocks (e.g. Schopfer and Steyrer, 2001; Le 

Guerroue and Cobbold, 2006).  

 

3.2.2. Corner zone 

 In the corner zone (as defined in Fig. 8), a lateral propagation of the thrust faults 

(F2,F3… Fn) to the wrenching domain was consistently observed, characterized by a 

rotation of these faults towards an orientation sub-parallel to the basal strike-slip 

direction (i.e. X axis, e.g. F2 in Fig.8A2 and B; F3 in Fig.8C). This parallelization 

occurred since relatively early strike-slip increments, and implied a clockwise rotation 

of about 60º around an inflexion point (IP in Figs. 8A2, B and C). Offset of parallel 

strain marker lines along these rotated fault segments agree with a dextral strike-slip 

component of movement. In sections cut across the same structures (Fig. 9 – cross 

section 3, 4 and 5), it was apparent that these also maintained a thrusting component, in 

accordance with general dextral-reverse oblique kinematics (e.g. F5 in cross section 3 

and 4 of Fig.9). In some experiments, strain accommodation in the corner zone implied 

the formation of new forethrusts in front of previously rotated fault segments (e.g. F3 



and F2 respectively in corner zone domain of Fig. 8A3), which as a result ceased to 

propagate and were passively thrusted in the hanging wall of the newer thrust-faults. 

Subsequently, these newer thrusts were themselves rotated also towards the basal strike-

slip fault direction, mimicking the rotation of the previous ones. For further strike-slip 

increments, the early formed structures in the corner zone were masked by the later 

deformation and became eventually indistinguishable. As a result, only the younger 

outer (oblique) faults were possible to observe in this domain (compare F5 outer thrust 

with F3 and F4 in Fig. 9A). The earlier (inner) thrusts tended to become more parallel to 

the strike-slip direction (i.e. they rotated more, e.g. F2 in Figs. 8A2, B and F3 in Fig. 

8C) than the later outer ones, which generally displayed a more oblique direction, 

subperpendicular to the one bisecting the angle made by basal strike-slip and the 

velocity discontinuity (e.g. F5 in Fig. 9A). In cross sections cutting both the wrenching 

deformation band and the thrust domain, obtained progressively closer to the zone of 

intersection between the basal strike-slip and the velocity discontinuity (Fig. 9A and B - 

cross sections 3, 4 and 5), it was possible to observe the along space variation of the 

interference between wrench-related and thrust-related structures: 

 

In cross section 3 (Fig. 9B), wrench and thrust domains can still be individualized. In 

the wrench domain, the corresponding deformation band was observed to be bounded, 

on the left, by a rotated segment of an outer thrust (F5, in Figs. 9A and B), and on the 

right by a Riedel fault. Both these structures showed some degree of dip-slip reverse 

movement, corresponding to dextral-reverse oblique faults bounding a transpressive 

pop-up, cut by Y-faults in its middle. The thrust domain along this same direction also 

corresponded to a (slightly asymmetric) pop-up structure, although in this case bounded 

by faults lacking any kind of strike-slip component of movement, formed during the 



first experimental step (faults in yellow in cross section 3 of Fig. 9B): on the left two 

forethrusts (F1 and F2), and on the right the original backthrust (BT).  

 

Cross section 4 was cut closer to the intersection between the basal strike-slip fault and 

the velocity discontinuity (Fig. 9B – cross section 4). In this cross-section the right-

bounding R-fault of the wrench domain was no longer observed, and instead the two 

original left-bounding faults of the thrust domain (F1 and F2) occurred immediately to 

the right of the Y-faults. It should be noted that to the left of these Y-faults, all the 

others (F3 – F5) also accommodated some amount of dextral wrenching, consisting in 

rotated segments of original thrusts exhibiting oblique (dextral-reverse) kinematics. 

Conversely, to the right of the Y-faults, the (F1 and F2) thrusts lacked any kind of 

wrenching component.  

 

Cross section 5 was cut through a direction containing the intersection between the trace 

of the basal strike-slip fault and the velocity discontinuity (Fig. 9B – cross section 5). 

Along this direction the separation between thrust and wrench domains was no longer 

straightforward. Instead a single interference domain was observed, comprising both 

original pure thrusts, formed during the first experimental step (F1, F2 and BT faults in 

yellow in Fig. 9B – cross section 5), and dextral strike-slip Y-faults as well as oblique 

dextral-reverse faults, formed during experimental step 2 (Y and F3-F5 faults in black 

in Fig. 9B – cross section 5). F1 and F2 faults were positioned to the left of Y-faults 

along this same cross-section, with the first steepening at depth towards the second, 

together defining a tulip-like (positive) flower-structure geometry, complying with 

overall (dextral) transpressional kinematics. 

  



4. Numerical modeling 

 

 Given the same general rheological, geometrical and kinematical constraints 

described above for the SWIM 1 - HTF tectonic system, wrench-thrust mechanical 

interference was simulated in a three-dimensional plate model using the 

ABAQUS/Standard software (ABAQUS, Inc. 2009). In this case the main objective was 

twofold: 

 

a) Examine the patterns of stress and strain distribution in the corner zone area and at 

depth, which could not be achieved by analogue modeling alone; 

 

b) Investigate the influence of an interbedded soft layer in the development of the corner 

zone deformation pattern, likewise benefiting from the numerical modeling approach 

that allows a simpler way of directly manipulating the rheological stratified structure of 

the model. 

 

4.1. Model setup  

 

 A basic model was considered (MOD1) representing an upper crustal block 

covering an area of 480 x 180 km, with a thickness of 6 km (Fig. 10A and C). This 

thickness complies with the maximum depth imaged by the available reflection seismics 

(e.g. TWT-depth conversion of IAM?4 line across the HAP by Jiménez?Munt et al., 

2010 and Gónzalez et al., 1998). Present model results were drawn from a central 240 x 

180 km subarea, to avoid boundary effects. Two planes of weakness, i.e. idealized 

faults, account for the Horseshoe thrust and SWIM 1 dextral strike-slip, dipping 30° and 



90° respectively, and intersecting each other with their surface traces making an angle 

of 120º/60º as in the natural example (see Figs. 2 and 3). 

 The interpretation of the available seismic reflection dataset also supports the 

assumption of a ~1.5 km thick layer, corresponding to the Late Miocene ?Chaotic 

Body? unit (see Figs. 4 and 5), at approximately 1.5 km below the seafloor. This 

?chaotic? seismic signature has been previously interpreted as resulting from a mixture 

of olistostromes and tectonic mélanges (Torelli et al., 1997; Tortella et al., 1997; 

Terrinha et al., 2009; Iribarren et al., 2007), which could hypothetically determine a 

relatively less competent, or event somewhat soft, rheological behavior. Such a 

possibility is here simulated by including an interbedded soft layer in the second set of 

models (MOD2). Also in this case the strike-slip fault does not reach the seafloor 

surface, as it terminates at the top of the soft layer at 1.5 km depth (Fig. 10D). This 

mimics the natural example were the SWIM1 fault shows little bathymetric expression 

(see Figs. 2 and 3), only mildly perturbing the top Late Miocene to Plio-quaternary unit 

in a few situations, although always undoubtedly cutting across the underlying Miocene 

?Chaotic body? unit (see Fig. 5). 

 

4.1.1. Rheologic and fault parameters 

 Although ABAQUS comes with many material behavior benchmarks we needed 

to conduct a large number of systematic tests to select the material properties. The most 

challenging were the material properties of the cohesive elements that constitute the 

faults, since they are commonly calibrated for small scale fractures found in engineering 

problems, and not for large scale geologic faults. Our approach was to iteratively 

change the parameters until we found displacement and stress solutions compatible with 

the natural estimates and observations. The Drucker-Prager plasticity model was chosen 



to model the brittle crustal behavior, since it is intended for geological materials that 

exhibit pressure-dependent yield and was found to be more stable than the Mohr-

Coulomb model. Since we were not interested in examining the details of the stress 

distribution within the soft layer a simple Von-Mises plasticity model was chosen to 

model the soft layer in MOD2. The Von-Mises material yields at a lower stress than the 

surrounding crustal material to simulate a decoupling layer. 

 The thrust and strike-slip faults are modeled as layers of cohesive elements. 

These are specifically designed for bonded interfaces where the interface thickness is 

negligibly small compared to other model dimensions. The constitutive response of the 

cohesive layer is defined in terms of an elastic traction versus separation law, i.e. there 

are three components of separation, one normal to the interface and two parallel to it. To 

prevent faults from opening or closing the normal component (E) is much stiffer than 

the in-plane components (G1 and G2). The thrust fault has greater G1 and G2 values 

than the strike-slip fault following the Coulomb-Navier’s law of fracture strength. All 

the material parameters are listed in Table 2. 

 

4.1.2 Boundary conditions and procedure 

 The boundary conditions try to match those of the analogue modeling 

experiments as closely as possible. Deformation is simulated by moving basal plate A to 

the right relatively to plate B (see Fig. 10A). Because there are some stiffness along the 

strike-slip fault, plate B is dragged by plate A towards the thrust fault. The maximum 

prescribed displacement along the X direction was 10 km, yielding a maximum 

shortening of 2%. Both basal plates are fixed in along the Y direction. Gravity 

(g=9.8m/s
2
) is applied as a body force. To counterbalance the weight of the overlying 

crust a lithostatic pressure is applied at the bottom of the model. Isostasy is simulated by 



applying spring forces at the bottom of the model with stiffness per unit area equal to 

(?m- ?w)g where ?m=3300 km/m
3
 is the mantle density and ?w=1000 km/m

3
 is the 

water density.  

 

4.2. Model Results  

 

4.2.1 Displacement pattern  

 Deformation of the basic model (MOD1) is illustrated by vertical displacement 

contours on a strained reference frame (i.e. grid, Fig. 10B), which shows that the 

rightwards push of basal plate A was accommodated by movement along both the thrust 

and strike-slip faults. Flexure of the plate also occurred in response to the topographical 

load caused by the fault offset, in agreement with the flexural theory of faulting. For 2% 

of shortening the maximum throw along the thrust fault was 1300 m (Fig. 10B), which 

is above the maximum observed throw along the Horseshoe Thrust Fault (~1000 m). It 

should be noted that in nature instead of a single thrust a system of thrusts 

accommodates the shortening (see, Fig. 4), implying that the maximum allowed 

shortening is underestimated in the simulation, whereas the fault’s throw is 

overestimated.  

 

4.2.2. Stress pattern  

 The stress field was analyzed in terms of maximum shear stress ½(?3- ?1) at the 

top and bottom of the plate (Fig. 11A). In both models (MOD1 and MOD2) it was 

observed that: a) The stresses were larger at the bottom than at the top of the plate, and 

largest stresses occurred at depth in the footwall of the thrust fault; b) At the top of the 

plate the largest stress contours occurred in the thrust hanging wall, elongated parallel to 



the thrust direction; c) At the bottom of the plate the largest stress contours were also 

aligned parallel to the thrust, but were located in its footwall instead; and most 

important d) with the exception of MOD 2 surface, stress contours consistently show a 

stress concentration in the corner zone (MOD1 Z=0 and 6000m and MOD2 Z=6000m in 

Fig. 11A). These corner stress magnitudes were larger and their distribution was wider 

at depth, whereas at the surface of MOD2 stress concentration was practically absent in 

the corner zone area. In this case, where the strike-slip fault was not prescribed above a 

soft layer (see Fig. 10D), the level of stress affecting the model plate was generally 

lower relatively to MOD1. Additionally, shear stress was focused along the direction of 

the strike-slip fault at the model surface (MOD2, Z=0m in Fig. 11A), although not at its 

bottom (Z=6000m) where a corner stress concentration clearly persisted (MOD2, 

Z=6000m in Fig. 11A). Likewise, the plot of principal stresses at model surface shows 

that in MOD1 the stress directions clearly rotate near the corner zone, and the maximum 

compressive stress magnitude increases by a factor of 1/3 (Fig. 11B, MOD1).  

Conversely, in MOD2 the maximum compressive stress orientation showed a constant 

obliquity (of 45º-50º) relatively to the strike-slip direction, without significantly varying 

its magnitude (Fig. 11B, MOD2). This is consistent with the focusing of shear 

deformation along the direction of the SWIM fault, in accordance with the contoured 

stress distribution mentioned above (MOD2, Z=0m in Fig. 11A). 

 

4.2.3. Initiation of brittle rupture (exceeded failure criterion)  

 The plot of the locations where the Drucker-Prager failure criterion was first 

exceeded in the plate model (Fig. 12) also showed the corner zone as one of the places 

where this occurred, both at the top (MOD1) and bottom of the plate. In both models, at 

6 km depth, brittle failure was predicted to occur in the corner zone and parallel to the 



Horseshoe Thrust Fault direction over a distance of 45 km. At the surface, both models 

showed rupture initiation in the hanging wall of the Horseshoe thrust, parallel to its 

direction, complying with the location of a backthrust. Also concurring with the stress 

distribution pattern described above, at the surface of the model plate, corner zone 

rupture initiation was only observed in MOD1 (Z=0m), and was absent at the surface of 

MOD 2 (Fig. 12, MOD2, Z=0m), where failure was preferably predicted to occur along 

the direction of the strike-slip fault.  

 

4.2.4. Strain pattern  

 The strain pattern was analyzed in terms of the equivalent plastic strain, i.e. the 

total unrecoverable strain accumulated after the onset of yielding according to the 

Drucker-Prager criterion. The pattern of plastic strain for both models is shown at three 

levels (Fig. 13): the top of the plate (Z=0m), the level corresponding to base of the soft 

layer in MOD2 at 3000 m depth, and the bottom of the plate (Z=6000m). The results 

can be summarized as follows: 

 

a) The largest strains were focused in the corner zone at all levels of MOD1, and strain 

concentration was larger in magnitude at depth than at the surface of the model (Fig. 13 

compare in MOD1 Z=0m with Z=3000m and Z=6000m). 

 

b) In MOD1 besides the corner zone, strain contours also occurred elongated parallel to 

the thrust direction, either in the footwall of the thrust at the base of the model (Fig. 13, 

Z=6000m), or more widely distributed in its hanging wall at the surface of the model 

(Z=0m). 

 



c) At MOD2 surface (Fig. 13, Z=0m) strain concentration occurred in the footwall of 

the thrust, along a 20 km wide deformation band parallel to the direction of the 

underlying strike-slip fault. At the base of the soft layer, strain also concentrated in the 

same area, but was clearly more widely distributed within plate A (Fig. 13, Z=3000m). 

 

d) In MOD2 at the base of the model (Fig. 13, Z=6000m) corner zone strain 

concentration persisted, but was clearly reduced relatively to MOD1 at the same depth. 

 

5. Discussion 

 

 Both analogue and numerical modeling results clearly show the importance of a 

corner effect expressed by the deformation pattern that is expected to develop in a brittle 

medium due to the mechanical interference between a dextral strike-slip fault and a 

thrust, intersecting each other at an angle of 120º/60º. Analogue modeling provides a 

characterization of the resultant basic structural pattern, revealing its essential geometry 

and kinematics. Numerical modeling provides insight on the way stress and strain are 

fundamentally distributed under the same conditions, and considers the effects of simple 

rheological variation accounting for an interbedded soft layer within the same brittle 

medium. 

 

5.1 Analogue modeling output 

 

 The experimentally obtained structural pattern is mostly characterized by a 

concentration in the corner zone of (see Figs. 8 and 9): a) oblique (dextral-reverse) 

faults, with different evolving geometries and associated kinematics; and b) vertical 



(dextral) strike-slip Y-faults. While Y-faults remain geometrically and kinematically 

stationary as strain accumulates in this area, corner zone oblique faults do not, 

corresponding to segments of originally pure thrusts that progressively propagate and 

rotate from the thrust-front to the wrench domain (see Fig. 8). This propagation-rotation 

is matched by a corresponding change in kinematics; from pure (reverse dip-slip) 

thrusting, to oblique (transcurrent dominant) dextral-reverse faulting. Early formed 

faults undergo a greater amount of more abrupt rotation, with their planes being more 

promptly parallelized to the basal strike-slip direction (F2 in Figs. 8A2 and B, and F3 in 

Fig. 8C). As strain continues to accumulate in the corner zone these same planes also 

become steeper (from an original dip of ~30º), and eventually subparallel to the Y-

faults, preferably accommodating dextral strike-slip movement (see for instance in F3 

and F4 in cross section 4 of Fig.9B). Later (outer) faults in the corner zone endure 

relatively less displacement, and thus are less rotated and steepened, striking somewhat 

subperpendicularly to the bisector of the angle defined by the thrust-front and the 

wrenching domains (see for instance F5 in Fig. 9A and cross section 5). 

 These results show that in this particular structural setting faults genetically 

related either to the wrench or to the thrust system do not evolve independently. Active 

strike-slip faulting in the wrench domain simultaneously triggers reverse (dip-slip) 

faulting in the thrust domain, which subsequently evolve to oblique-slip faulting 

towards the corner zone. 

 

5.2. Numerical modeling output 

 



 The numerical modeling results comply with the existence of a wrench-thrust 

interference corner effect, in accordance with the structural pattern obtained in the 

analogue modeling experiments. 

 

5.2.1. MOD1  

 Stress and strain contours obtained for MOD1 reveal a consistent concentration 

in the corner zone, both at the bottom and at the surface of the model (see Figs. 11A and 

13, MOD1).  Likewise, plot of brittle rupture initiation (Fig. 12, MOD1) also shows that 

failure is prompt to initiate in the same interference area. This agrees with the corner 

zone concentration of faults that characterizes the structural pattern formed in the 

analogue models (see Figs. 8 and 9). Also, the rotation of the stress field and of the 

maximum compressive stress in the corner zone (see Fig. 11B – MOD1) agrees with the 

described geometry and kinematics of early formed (inner) faults in the analogue 

models, specifically with their steepness and dominant-transcurrent oblique kinematics 

(see F3 and F4 in Fig. 9A and cross section 4).   

 Besides the corner zone, the obtained stress and strain contours also show a 

preferable concentration parallel to the direction of the thrust-fault, both in its footwall 

at the bottom of the model (Figs. 11 and 13 MOD 1, Z=6000m), and in its hanging wall 

at model surface, corresponding to a wider distribution in this case (Figs. 11 and 13, 

MOD 1, Z=0m). In the footwall, this is compatible with the expected site of nucleation 

of a new forethrust at depth, which also complies with the obtained analogue results, 

whereas in the hanging wall the stress-strain wider distribution could result from the 

combined effect of backthrust nucleation and outer-arc extension, associated to some 

degree of fold-thrusting in the hanging wall. The plot of the locations where the brittle 

failure criterion was first exceeded in MOD1 also confirms these assumptions, showing 



a narrow strip corresponding to the potential forethrust rupture zone in the footwall at 

depth (Fig. 12, MOD1, z=6000m), and a wider band that could correspond to the more 

distributed rupture area accommodating outer-arc extension in the hanging wall at 

model surface (see Fig. 12, MOD1, z=0m).  

 

5.2.2. MOD2  

 The fact that the prescribed strike-slip fault in MOD2 does not breach out at the 

model surface, ending at the top of the interbedded soft later (at 1.5 km depth, Fig. 

10D), explains the (almost complete) absence of a corner effect in this case, since it 

prevents the stress and strain from concentrating in the corner zone area above the 

strike-slip fault (see Figs. 11 and 13, MOD2 at Z=0m). Instead, stress and strain are 

preferably concentrated along a deformation (shear) band, coincident with the direction 

of the underlying strike-slip fault. The plot of the location where brittle rupture initiates 

also confirms the absence of corner zone rupture at the model surface, showing it is 

preferable expected to occur along the strike-slip fault direction (see Fig. 12, MOD2, 

Z=0m).  

 At the base of the soft layer, although strain concentration along the strike-slip 

direction is also apparent, a strain delocalization effect clearly occurs in the area 

corresponding to the footwall of plate A (Fig. 13, MOD2, Z=3000m). Such strain 

delocalization is determined by the (soft) rheological response of the interbedded layer 

that manifests by the hindering of fault nucleation and propagation.  

 At the base of MOD2 the corner effect, which is practically absent at model 

surface, persists (Figs. 11, 12 and 13, MOD2, Z= 6000m), since here the existent strike-

slip fault favors stress concentration and strain accumulation the corner zone. 

 



5.3. Comparison with the natural example and tectonic implications 

 

 The morphotectonic interpretation of the HAP corner zone area, based on the 

available bathymetry and MCS reflection dataset, revealed a natural structural pattern 

consistent with the one obtained in the analogue modeling experiments (Fig. 14). 

Similarities between the model and natural example are mostly represented by faults 

exhibiting matching particular geometries and kinematics. Such model-prototype 

congruence shows that the observed natural tectonic pattern was not formed randomly, 

but instead corresponds to what is to be expected for the described thrust-wrench 

interference between the SWM 1 and Horseshoe faults. 

 The modeled interdependency between both these fault systems, agrees with a 

possible multi-rupture scenario involving coeval strike-slip faulting in the wrenching 

domain (SWIM system), reverse-faulting in the thrust domain (Horseshoe system), and 

sequentially induced oblique, dextral-reverse faulting in corner zone (SWIM 1 – HTF 

intersection). Multi-rupture scenarios have been documented in other places involving 

dominant transcurrent continental fault-systems, in which main strike-slip earthquakes 

trigger thrust-related aftershocks, generally nucleating in restraining bends subsidiary of 

the main transcurrent system (e.g. Gobi-Altay fault and San Andreas fault, Bayarsayhan 

et al., 1996, Kurushin et al., 1997). Although also in continental domains, wrench-thrust 

interference faulting is likewise known to be associated to complex rupture, comprising 

triggering of thrust faulting only tens of seconds after strike-slip faulting (e.g. 1976 

Tangshan earthquake, Butler et al., 1979). In the Gulf of Cadiz, multi-rupture associated 

to some kind of interference between different faults (e.g. the HTF, MPF and SWIM) 

has also been generically proposed by previous authors (e.g. Gràcia et al., 2003a,b; 

Terrinha et al., 2003, 2009). Specifically in the present case, and given the dimension of 



the faults at stake, rupture areas associated to the corresponding earthquakes could 

hardly justify the energy release implied by high magnitude events (M&gt;8.5), such as the 

1755 Great Lisbon Earthquake (Gutscher et al., 2009b). Nonetheless, the potential 

multi-rupture associated to the study thrust-wrench tectonic interference should be taken 

into consideration while addressing seismic hazards for low to moderate magnitude 

events (up to M7). 

 In the study area, recent reports on the local seismicity corresponding to these 

low to moderate magnitude events (Geissler et al., 2010; Silva et al., 2010) showed a 

strong concentration in the SWIM1-HTF corner zone (see Fig. 6). However, it should 

be noted that these earthquakes are located at depths mostly comprised between 40 and 

55 km, corresponding to the base of the seismogenic layer (within lithospheric mantle), 

whilst in the available MCS profiles corner faults are imaged at maximum depths of 

approximately 6km: one order of magnitude below (e.g. CF1 and CF2 in Fig. 5). It is 

thus difficult to envisage a direct connection between these faults, imaged at upper 

crustal depths, and the reported seismicity originated at lithospheric mantle depths. 

Nonetheless, it should be noted that the great majority of these earthquakes is 

concentrated ~14 and ~25km to the SE of CF1 and CF2 corner faults, respectively (see 

Fig. 6) in an area closer to the intersection between the SWIM1 and Horseshoe faults. 

Such earthquake location would comply with a southeastwards dip of CF1 and CF2 

faults of about 74º and 62º respectively, admitting the unlikely possibility that they 

could prolong 40-50km downwards to the lithospheric mantle without being 

significantly deflected. Even so, the mentioned fault steepness qualitatively agrees with 

the interpretation proposed for these structures in the MCS profiles (see Fig. 5), and is 

also compatible with their interpreted dominant transcurrent oblique kinematics. In spite 

of the seemingly congruence regarding these aspects, no direct evidence exists at this 



point to support that these corner structures correspond to translithospheric, or even 

deep seated faults, as is the case of the SWIM 1 and the HTF. As a result, it is more 

likely that the studied thrust-wrench interference corner effect recognized in the upper-

crust could also exist at deeper lithospheric levels. Accordingly, a replication of the 

same tectonic interference pattern would occur at different depths, in different 

lithospheric layers with similar bulk rheology, under the same regional (tectonic) stress 

constraints. This is seemingly supported by the congruency between the variable 

orientation of the seismically imaged faults (at upper crustal depths), and the variation 

of planes deduced from focal mechanisms (at mantle lithospheric depths). These same 

focal mechanisms were also reported as somewhat heterogeneous by Geissler et al. 

(2010), although mostly compatible with reverse and strike-slip faulting. Such 

heterogeneity agrees with the modeled thrust-wrench tectonic scenario as shown by the 

obtained interference structural pattern in the analogue models, where corner zone faults 

assume evolving different geometries and kinematics (see Figs. 8 and 9). Geissler et al. 

(2010) also report the direction of the principal stress components, based on the 

estimated average stress tensors consistent with observed fault slip orientations. 

According to this, the maximum compressive stress rotates from an approximately E-W 

direction, near the northern termination of the HTF (?1 at N103ºE/26º strike/plunge), to 

a more N-S direction in the corner zone (?1 at N351º/12º), roughly bisecting the angle 

between the SWIM 1 and the Horseshoe Thrust Fault (see ?1 in Fig. 6). This rotation 

complies, not only with the corner zone rotation of the maximum compressive stress 

obtained for MOD1 numerical results (see Fig. 11B, MOD1), but also with the 

orientation of the characteristic oblique corner faults, observed both in the analogue 

model and natural structural patterns (see Figs. 8, 9 and 14). 



 The idea that the same thrust-wrench tectonic interference can manifest in a 

decoupled manner at different (crustal and mantle) lithospheric depths, could explain 

the recurrently recognized spatial discrepancy in the Gulf of Cadiz between: (a) the 

mapped main tectonic structures, possible associated to high magnitude earthquakes, 

and (b) the dominant low to intermediate ?background? seismicity (up to M7), to which 

specific faults are generally difficult to ascribe. 

 Such a decoupling is also illustrated at a different scale, in the upper crust, by 

MOD2 numerical modeling results (see Figs. 11, 12 and 13), which show that an 

interbedded soft layer can be responsible for some degree of strain delocalization, 

hindering the propagation of faults, and thus inhibiting the morphological expression of 

the fault interference pattern in the corner zone area. This could explain the poor 

bathymetric expression of the corner zone structural pattern in the HAP seafloor, caused 

by a soft-like rheological behavior of the Late Miocene ?Chaotic Body? unit determined 

by its postulated olistostromic nature. 

 

6. Conclusions 

 

The following main conclusions are drawn: 

 

a) The detailed newly mapped tectonic pattern, observed in the intersection area (corner 

zone) between the SWIM 1 fault and the Horseshoe thrust, formed as the result of the 

tectonic interference between correspondent active strike-slip and thrust faulting, 

respectively. 

 



b) Modeling results show that dextral strike-faulting in the SWIM wrenching domain 

promotes reverse faulting in the Horseshoe frontal-thrust domain, and sequentially 

(dextral-reverse) oblique faulting in the (corner) zone of intersection between both main 

faults. Results show that in the corner zone domain a preferred concentration of stress 

and strain occurs (corner effect), and is mainly accommodated by oblique faulting, 

although faults exhibit different evolving geometries and matching kinematics as they 

endure some degree of rotation.  

 

c) In view of the present results, a multi-rupture scenario, within the active tectonic 

framework of the connected SWIM 1 and the HTF systems can be envisaged, and 

should be carefully considered in assessing the seismic-related hazards of low to 

moderate seismicity (up to M7) in the Gulf of Cadiz region. 

 

d) In the SWIM 1- HTF corner zone the tectonic pattern is seismically imaged at upper 

crustal depths, whereas the local seismicity is reported to preferentially occur in the 

lithospheric mantle (Geissler et al., 2010). Nonetheless, faults and seismicity data are 

congruent in a number of aspects (orientation of fault planes and planes deduced from 

focal mechanisms, fault kinematics and focal mechanisms, compatibility with similar 

stress filed orientation). This suggests the possibility of a decoupled manifestation of the 

same thrust-wrench tectonic interference at different lithospheric depths, which would 

explain the recurrently observed discrepancy between the mapped main tectonic 

structures in the Gulf of Cadiz, that could originate high magnitude earthquakes, and the 

existent low to intermediate seismicity (up to M7). 

 



e) Numerical modeling results also illustrate the influence that rheological stratigraphy 

might exert on the nucleation and propagation of the corner zone fault pattern in the 

upper crust. Specifically, an interbedded soft layer is shown to inhibit the stress-strain 

corner zone concentration in the overlying competent layer. In accordance, the mild 

morphological (bathymetric) expression of the corner zone interference tectonic pattern 

in the HAP seafloor, can be explain by strain delocalization, and consequent hinder of 

fault propagation, induced by a soft rheological response of the Late Miocene ?Chaotic? 

unit.

Appendix A  

  

 Dry quartz sand is classically used to simulate the mechanical behavior of upper 

crustal rocks, since it deforms in a brittle way according to the Coulomb fracture 

criterion (e.g. Hubbert, 1937, 1951; Davis et al., 1983): 

 

                



 

where     is the shear stress,    is the coefficient of internal friction (       , and 

   internal friction angle),    is the normal stress, and    is the cohesion of the 

material. According to the scale model theory (Hubbert, 1937), proper scaling is 

achieved when the ratios ?, ? and ? between model and natural prototype are 

independently established for the three fundamental units of length (L), time (T) and 

mass (M), respectively: 

 

   
    

    
    

    

    
    

    

    
     

 

where ( ) stands for model and ( ) for natural prototype. The Coulomb fracture 

criterion governs time independent deformation of brittle materials, since yield stress is 

insensitive to the rate of deformation provided that the inertial forces are negligible, as 

in the present case. Thus,   ratio is redundant for the present scaling. Length ratio ( ) 

was chosen given the dimensions of the employed deformation apparatus (see section 

3.1.2 and Fig. 7) as         . Of the two relevant material properties, coefficient of 

internal friction (  ) and cohesion (  ), the first is dimensionless, and approximately the 

same in both model and prototype (see Table 1), whereas the second has dimension of 

stress and thus must be scaled accordingly (Hubbert, 1937): 

 

  
     

     
 

  

 
 
      

 

where   and   are the model/prototype ratio for stress and for acceleration respectively. 

Since inertial forces are negligible when compared with gravity, 



 

     
 

   

 
   

 
 

  
       

 

where    is the model/prototype gravity acceleration ratio. Thus, substituting     in 

equation (3) allows the following simplification: 

 

  
     

     
 

 

 
 
 

  

 
 
         

 

where   corresponds to the model/prototype density ratio. Substituting   and   in 

equation (5) by the respective values of Table 1, immediately allows the determination 

of the implied mass ratio             . It should also be noted that since   is 

generally close to one (between 0.5 and 0.7, e.g. Withjack et al., 2007) the strength of 

the materials expressed by   is scaled with the lengh ( ). Given the fact that in the 

present case          and since cohesion for upper crustal rocks is clearly typically 

less than 50 MPa, it becomes immediately evident the utility of model materials with 

very low cohesion (&lt;100Pa), such as dry quartz sand, as analogues of upper crustal 

rocks.

Fig. 10 - (A) Geometry and boundary conditions of numerical model. Plate A moves to 

the right along the X direction. All other boundaries are fixed in the normal Y and Z 

directions. Gravity is balanced by an applied lithostatic pressure at the base of the 

model. Spring forces are also applied at the base to simulate isostasy. (B) Deformation 

of finite element grid and vertical displacement (U3) obtained for 10 km of applied 

shortening (MOD1). The results are displayed in the central 240 km region of the 

model. (C and D) Conceptual YZ sections illustrating model setup for MOD1 and MOD 

2, respectively. In MOD2 a 1.5 km thick soft layer is placed at 1.5 km beneath the 

surface, with the strike-slip (SWIM) fault not defined above it.
