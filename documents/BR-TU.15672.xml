ABSTRACT: This study aimed to evaluate the sorghum plants development (Sorghum bicolor L. 
Moench) submitted to different water table levels. The experiment was carried out in a glasshouse on 
trays with water reservoirs that allowed sub irrigation, and PVC tubes (15 cm diameter) with different 
heights simulating five water table levels (17 cm; 31 cm; 45 cm; 59 cm; 73 cm), treatments T1; T2; T3; 
T4; T5 respectively, in an entirely random design. The analyzed parameters were: fresh and dry matter, 
height and stem diameter of plants; fresh and dry matter and length of panicles; dry matter of roots; leaf 
area; crop evapotranspiration (ETc), and Kc= ETc/ETo. Water table depths between 45 and 59 cm 
showed significantly higher values for fresh and dry matter. The weight for fresh and dry matter and 
length of panicle tended to higher values for T4 and T5. There was no statistical significance among T3, 
T4 and T5 for stem diameter. Cultivated plants under water table closer to the surface induced plants to 
produce thicker stems.  
Keywords: agronomic characteristics, evapotranspiration, crop coefficient. 

 
DESENVOLVIMENTO DE PLANTAS DE SORGO SUBMETIDAS A DIFERENTES 

NÍVEIS DE LENÇOL FREÁTICO EM CASA DE VEGETAÇÃO 
 

RESUMO: O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar o desenvolvimento das plantas de sorgo (Sorghum 
bicolor L. Moench) submetidas a diferentes níveis de lençol freático. O projeto foi realizado em casa de 
vegetação de vidro, sobre bandejas com reservatórios de água que permitiam a subirrigação e vasos 
constituídos de tubos de PVC (15 cm de diâmetro) com diferentes alturas simulando diferentes níveis de 
lençol freático com cinco profundidades (0,17 m; 0,31 m; 0,45 m; 0,59 m; 0,73 m), tratamentos T1; T2; 
T3; T4; T5 e T6 respectivamente, em delineamento inteiramente casualizado. Os parâmetros analisados 
foram: massa da matéria fresca e seca, altura e diâmetro do colmo das plantas; massa da matéria fresca 
e seca e comprimento das panículas; massa da matéria seca das raízes total; área foliar; número de 
folhas; evapotranspiração da cultura (ETc); coeficiente da cultura (Kc). T3 e T4 foram os melhores, 
apresentando os maiores valores para ambas as massas, fresca e seca. Para as panículas, os maiores 
valores para as massas de matéria fresca e seca e comprimento foram apresentados por T4 e T5. Para o 
diâmetro do colmo não houve significância estatística entre T3, T4 e T5. Plantas cultivadas em níveis 
freáticos mais próximos da superfície induziram a produção de colmos mais grossos.  
Palavras-chave: características agronômicas, evapotranspiração, coeficiente da cultura. 
 

 
1. INTRODUCTION 

Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) is the fifth 
most important cereal in the world, preceded by wheat, 
rice, corn and barley and it is one of the most versatile 
and efficient of them regarding its photosynthesis and 
maturation speed (RIBAS, 2003). This crop demands less 
water to develop when compared to other cereals and, 
when compared to corn, sorghum produces more under 
water stress (the roots exploits the soil profile better), 
dries up less and is able to recover from longer drought 

(MAGALHÃES; DURÃES, 2003). Sorghum is an 
important alternative to help the provision of grains and, 
because of its nutritional characteristics, it has been 
studied as an alternate energetic ingredient to corn. The 
sorghum cultivation has great yield potential in regions 
with irregular rainfall due to its adaptation capacity and 
tolerance to high temperatures (REIS, 1992). 

In Brazil, information on adaptability and stability of 
sorghum are scarce. The cultivars behavior analyses are 
extremely important to verify its performance over the 



TANAKA et al. (2014). Development of sorghum plants submitted under different water table levels in glasshouse

cycle (SILVA et al., 2005). The forage sorghum, for 
example, shows growth expectation in semi-arid region 
due to its characteristics xerophytes and recovers after 
stress, ensuring production under adverse conditions 
(SCAPIM et al., 1998). The Brazilian grain production 
depends almost entirely on rainfall. In years when the 
weather conditions are unfavorable, there is generally a 
deficit in grain production, because they are crops 
cultivated under adverse weather and soil conditions, can 
reduce the impact of this factor in the provision of grains. 
A sorghum plant tolerates water deficit and excessive soil 
moisture content as well as too dry and/or too hot 
environmental situations, where the productivity of other 
cereals is not economic.  

The experimental investigation on evapotranspiration 
to determine the water needs of crops has been 
exhaustively studied in recent decades, due to the need to 
conduct irrigation in a rational way within the reality of 
each region (LUNARDI, 2000). The water requirements 
of crop and soil conditions are the principal factors for the 
design of an irrigation system (FOLEGATTI, 1988; 
REICHARDT, 1996; PEREIRA et al., 1997). According 
to Silveira; Klar (2001), the problem worsens when there 
are not enough data that allow knowing the crop yield 
reduction caused by different water table levels. 

The water requirement determination and crop 
coefficient (Kc) by lysimeters has been employed in 
Brazil. Water table constant lysimeters were considered 
accurate for studies of small crops (PAVANI, 1985). 
Alves et al. (1994), in order to verify the importance of 
the area in the lysimeter capillary rise, assembled a 
battery of soil columns in PVC tubes with several 
diameters to examine the possible influence of capillary 
rise in small areas and concluded that the diameter of soil 
columns did not interfere with the capillary rise and 
further this is a specific phenomenon of soil, regardless of 
the vessel that is confining. 

Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the development of 
sorghum plants submitted to different water table levels in 
glasshouse, in Botucatu – São Paulo state. 

 
2. MATERIAL AND METHODS 

This study was carried out in the experimental area of 
the Department of Rural Engineering of the College of 
Agronomical Sciences of UNESP – Botucatu, São Paulo 
State, Brazil, in latitude of 22º51’ S, longitude of 48º26’ 
W and altitude of 786 meters. The glasshouse was 6 m 
long, 4 m wide and 3 m high, painted with 10 cm white 
stripes in order to decrease the environment internal 
energy.  

The weather of the region, according to Köeppen 
classification is Cwa characterized: hot subtropical 
weather (mesothermal) with rainfall in the summer and 
drought in the winter, and the average temperature of the 
hottest month is over 22ºC (CENTRO DE PESQUISAS 
METEOROLÓGICAS E CLIMÁTICAS APLICADAS À 
AGRICULTURA – CEPAGRI, 2009). We used sorghum 
seeds of Catissorgo cultivar with sowing on December 23, 
2008 and the final harvest on March 23, 2009. The seeds 
were treated with captan (200 g i a./100 kg seeds) and five 
seeds were sown per pot.  

The Catissorgo cultivar has double purpose, it can be 
used as forage and grain production, and has the 

following characteristics: cycle of 115 days for grain, 90 
days for silage; planting occurs from January to March; 
flowering period from 70 to 75 days after planting (DAP), 
height is about 1.40 m and stand of 120,000 plants per 
hectare (COORDENADORIA DE ASSISTÊNCIA 
TÉCNICA INTEGRAL – CATI, 2009). 

The equipment to measure the crop evapotranspiration 
consisted: the pots were 150 mm diameter PVC tubes 
with PVC covers on the bottom perforated to allow 
capillary irrigation. Each pot consisted rings of 7cm 
height, attached with adhesive tape and forming tubes 
with 21, 35, 49, 63 and 77 cm high. Tubes were partially 
buried (approximately 4 cm, discounted on total height) in 
sand, to simulate five water tables depths (17; 31; 45; 59 
and 73 cm; treatments T1; T2; T3; T4; T5, respectively), 
on white metal trays measuring 40 cm wide, 60 cm long 
and 14 cm high, and filled with thick washed sand.  

The trays had an intermediate chamber provided with 
a float level controller ball to keep constant water level. 
This chamber was filled up by a water reservoir graduated 
in millimeters, consisting of an 80 cm high, 15 cm 
diameter PVC tube. The water supply of the intermediate 
chamber was done by a 2 cm perforated PVC tube 
diameter. In order to evaluate only the pot 
evapotranspiration, the interstices among them were filled 
up with paraffin and part of the reservoir was sealed with 
Styrofoam (Figure 1).

SILVEIRA; KLAR, 2001). 

 
The pots were filled with soil and reservoirs received 

water one week before planting in order to stabilize the 
capillarity process (SILVEIRA; KLAR, 2001). The soil 
used to fill up the pots was obtained from an area close to 
the glasshouse in the Department of Rural Engineering (0-
20 cm layer) and it was corrected and fertilized following 
the recommendations of the Technical Bulletin 100 (RAIJ 
et al., 1997).  

The temperature and relative air humidity inside the 
glasshouse were measured by psycrometer with forced 
ventilation. The evapotranspiration data were obtained by 
evaporimetric pan of 60 cm diameter and 25.5 cm height. 
The analyzed responses of sorghum plants to different 
treatments were: fresh and dry matter, and height and 
stem diameter of plants; fresh and dry matter and length 
of panicles; crop evapotranspiration (ETc), Kc 
(=ETc/ETo).

The leaf area of plants was estimated by the relation of 
length, the largest leaf width and an adjustment factor 
equal 0.747 (STICKLER et al., 1961).  

The crop evapotranspiration was measured daily with 
a graduated scale tape located in the reservoirs. The pots 
were disassembled and roots were collected to get dry 
matter. 

The experiment design was completely randomized 
with five treatments and 10 replications. The data were 
compared by Tukey’s test at 5% of probability using 
Sisvar (2003) software. 
 
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

The emergence of plants started on December 27th, 
2008 (4 DAP) and extended until January 4th, 2009 as 
shown in Table 1. The thinning was done on January 
12th, 2009, leaving 2 plants per pot. In order to allow seed 
germination of deeper treatments (T3, T4, T5 and T6), 
was added 100 ml of water every day until there were 
four expanded leaves. The treatments with more available 
water emerged before the other ones.

Peters et al. (1982) report that sorghum crop presents 

some problems related to the physiological quality of 
seeds that affect the initial emergence due to its 
germination was not uniform. Treatment T5 (73 cm) had a 
problem at first and started emergence at 10 days after 
planting. Alves et al. (1994) observed that the diameter of 
soil columns (ranging from 5 to 25 cm), does not 
influence capillary ascension to tubes up to 1.5 meters 
height. 

The flowering duration of sorghum plants, regarding 
the 10 replications, is represented in Table 2. Treatments 
T1, T2 and T5 were the last ones, starting their flowering 
at 68, 69 and 74 DAP. The T3 flowering duration was 8 
days and T1, 22 days. The T4 was the most precocious, 
beginning its flowering at 62 DAP and lasting 16 days. 
According to Magalhães; Durães (2003), the flowering 
duration ranged from 6 to 15 days and occurred at 60 to 
82 DAP; corroborating with the results found in this study 
where: flowering duration was from 8 to 22 days and at 
74 DAP. 

The averages of fresh and dry matter weight of 
sorghum plant aerial parts were statistically analyzed by 
Tukey’s test at 5%, and it is observed in Table 3 that there 
were differences among treatments. Treatments T4 (137.3 
g) and T5 (131.5 g) significantly had the greatest fresh 
matter weights while compared to T1 (89.4 g) and T2 (31 

g), which is probably a result of the lower volume of 
available plant roots. Treatment T3 did not differs 
statistically from the other ones, considering their fresh 
and dry matter aerial part weights. Treatment T4 (64.01 g) 
statistically presented the greatest aerial part dry matter 
weight, when compared to treatments T5 (41.07 g), T1 
(37.52 g) and T2 (36.25 g) that had the lowest ones.

These results corroborated with the ones found by 

Barreto et al. (2008) who worked with forage sorghum 
and observed a decrease in the production of fresh and dry 
matter when submitted to flooding and compared to levels 
of T1 and T2. In T5, plants started developing like in the 
other treatments even germination was late due to the 
delay to receive water from the water table (Table 1). This 
treatment also had some discrepancies in height (Table 4) 
that influenced dry matter values (Table 3) with 
significant lower data than T4, but with larger stem 
diameter (Table 4) when compared to T1 and T2.

There was no significant difference for aerial part 

length of plants as shown in Table 4 but there was a 
tendency for higher averages in treatments T4 (133.80 
cm) and T3 (130.55 cm). The plant height was inferior to 
the characteristics described for the Catissorgo cultivar by 
CATI, 2009 was 140 cm, because the plants were 
collected before maturation.  

The diameter average of stem, in mm, obtained at the 
plant base, was significantly different (Table 4). For T5,

the diameter (15.15 mm) was the largest one and did not 
significantly differ from T4 (14.65 mm) and T3 (13.20 
mm), but it was different from the other ones. Treatments 
T4, T3 and T1 (12.50 mm) did not differ among 
themselves and the treatments T3, T1 and T2 (12.20 mm) 
did not either, but still treatments T4 and T5 tend to 
present higher values than the other ones. 

The T1 (11.46 g) was the only one that differed in 
relation to other ones, in comparison of total dry matter 
plant roots by Tukey’s test at 5%; the others did not differ 
as shown in Table 5, because T1 had only 17 cm, which is 
little space for good root development.

treatments T4 (19.71 g) and T5 (17.95 g) in the average 
comparison of panicle fresh matter by Tukey’s (Table 06) 
and it had the lowest average because it was under 
unfavorable conditions to its development, as already 

mentioned before. Treatments T3 (13.28 g) and T2 (12.77

There were differences among the treatments for 

panicle length (Table 6); T5 (25.57 cm) and T4 (23.97 
cm) had the highest averages and T1 (17.85 cm) and T2 
(18.97 cm) the lowest ones. T3 did not differ statistically 
to the others in these variables (fresh, dry and length). 
According to Magalhães; Durães (2003), the panicle 
length ranges from 4 to 25 cm. In this stage of the crop 
development, T5 plants had water availability favorable to 
the panicles development. Crop evapotranspiration (ETc), 
reference evapotranspiration (ETo), and Kc are shown in 
Table 7. The values of crop evapotranspiration shown 
closed values from 81 to 87 mm, except for T1 (64 mm)

The crop coefficient (Kc) values increased with crop 
development until maximum development and then 
decreased with plant senescence (DOORENBOS, 1979). 
This was not completed in this study. In the tables above, 
this tendency can be observed, because the plants were 
harvested after the emission of the last panicles of the 
plants in the experiment. Initial Kc average (until 
flowering) of the treatments was around 0.50 and after 
that phase, the average Kc was 1.30; these values were 
higher than those recommended by FAO, 0.3 and 1.15, 

respectively (DOORENBOS, 1979). The climate 
conditions in the glasshouse and the plant confinement 
may be the cause for the discrepancy among the result 
differences. 

 
4. CONCLUSIONS 

The results under this experiment conditions allowed 
the following conclusions: There were differences in the 
development of the plants submitted to different water 
table treatments: - below 73 cm would not be

recommended; from 45 to 59 cm had significantly higher 
values for fresh and dry matter. These variables for 
panicles, as well as the length, tend to have higher values 
for treatments from 59 to 73 cm;  

The plants tended to be higher in treatments with 45 
cm (130.55 cm) and 59 cm (133.80 cm). To stem 
diameter, there were no significant statistic values among 
the treatments with 45, 59 and 73 cm. However, they 
were significantly different from the ones cultivated in 
water tables closer to the surface; The 17 cm water table 
presented fresh and dry matter values statistically lower 
than the other treatments; The crop evapotranspiration 
presented similar values, except for treatments with 17 
and 73 cm that had lower values; Kc values (ETc/ETo) 
had an average of 0.50 in the first stage (until flowering) 
and 1.30 in the following one.
