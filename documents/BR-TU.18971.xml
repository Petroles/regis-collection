ABSTRACT  

Nano-hydroxyapatite (nanoHA) has a variety of proposed applications in bone 

repair/regeneration strategies. Most of the published work regarding the biological 

profile of nanoHA relies on films, composite scaffolds, dense or porous bulks or 

cements manufactured with HA nanoparticles. A clear deficit exists on studies 

addressing the biological assessment of individual nanosized HA particles. Considering 

the close association of angiogenesis and osteogenesis in bone formation events, this 

study aims to address the biological profile of nanoHA particles on isolated and co-

cultured  osteoblast and endothelial cells. 

In the present study, nanoHA particles, sinthesized by a hydrothermal method, 

were characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), Fourier transmission infrared 

spectroscopy (FTIR) and tansmission eletron microscopy (TEM). In vitro biological 

studies were performed using MG-63 osteoblast-like cells (10
3
 cell cm

-2
) and human 

dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC, 2x10
4
 cell cm

-2
) cultured isolated or 

co-cultured in endothelium medium. Cultures were maintained for 14 days in the 

absence (control) and in the presence of different concentrations of nanoparticles. 

NanoHA particles (1-100 ?g ml
-1

) were added to the seeded cells at two different 

moments: day 1 and at day 7. Nanoparticles added at day 1: cultures were 

characterized at days 2, 7 and 14; nanoparticles added at day 7: cultures were 

evaluated at days 8(7) and 14(7), for cell viability/proliferation (MTT assay), pattern of 

cell growth (confocal layser scanning microscopy; CLSM), particle internalization and 

kinetics within cell compartiments (TEM). 

Results showed that monocultures of MG-63 cells and HDMEC, maintained in 

the absence of nanoparticles, presented high viability and the expected pattern of cell 

growth. Also, control co-cultures exhibited high viability and the formation of clusters 

of osteoblastic cells surrounded by endothelial cells. The presence of nanoHA caused a 

dose-dependent increase in the viability/proliferation of osteoblast cells, but opposite 

results were found in HDMEC. Co-cultures showed a slight increase in the cell 

viability/proliferation. Particles were readily internalized by both MG-63 cells and 

HDMEC, but endothelial cells presented the higher percentage of intracellular vesicles 

loaded with nanoparticles. Co-cultured osteoblastic and endothelial cells exhibited less 



 

iv 
 

internalization of nanoparticles, compared to the respective monocultures. The 

described effects, caused by the presence of nanoHA particles, were more significant 

when those were added at the beginning of the culture. 

Results suggest that nanoHA particles modulate the behaviour of osteoblastic 

and endothelial cells and also affects the interaction between these two cell types, 

representing a promissing biomaterial for new strategies in bone tissue engineering.

RESUMO 

A nano-hidroxiapatite (nanoHA) tem inúmeras aplicações em estratégias de 

reparação e regeneração do tecido ósseo. A maioria dos trabalhos publicados, a 

propósito do perfil biológico da nanoHA, baseia-se em filmes, compósitos, estruturas 

densas ou porosas, ou cimentos compostos por nanopartículas de HA. No entanto, 

existe um défice evidente em relação à avaliação biológica de nanopartículas isoladas 

de HA. Considerando a estreita associação entre os processos de angiogénese e 

osteogénese nos eventos de formação óssea, este estudo pretende abordar o perfil 

biológico das nanopartículas de HA em monoculturas e co-culturas de células 

osteoblásticas e endoteliais. 

No presente estudo, as nanopartículas de HA, sintetizadas por método 

hidrotermal, foram caracterizadas por XRD, análise FTIR e TEM. Os estudos biológicos 

in vitro foram realizados utilizando culturas isoladas e co-culturas de células 

osteoblásticas humanas MG-63 (10
3
 cell cm

-2
) e células endoteliais microvasculares 

dérmicas humanas (HDMEC, 2x10
4
 cell cm

-2
), em meio de cultura endotelial. As 

culturas foram mantidas por 14 dias na ausência (controlo) e na presença de 

nanopartículas em diferentes concentrações. As nanopartículas de HA (1-100 ?g ml
-1

) 

foram adicionadas às células em cultura em dois momentos diferentes: ao dia 1 e ao 

dia 7. Para as partículas adicionadas ao dia 1: as culturas foram caracterizadas nos dias 

2, 7 e 14; para as partículas adicionadas ao dia 7: as culturas foram avaliadas aos dias 

8(7) e 14(7), para os padrões de viabilidade/proliferação celular (MTT) e de 

crescimento celular (CLSM), assim como para a internalização das partículas e a sua 

cinética dentro dos compartimentos celulares (TEM). 

Os resultados obtidos demonstraram que as monoculturas de células MG-63 e 

HDMEC, na ausência de nanopartículas, apresentaram alta viabilidade celular e o 

esperado padrão de crescimento celular. Para além disso, as co-culturas controlo 

apresentaram alta viabilidade celular e a formação de aglomerados de células 

osteoblásticas rodeadas por células endoteliais. A presença de nanopartículas de HA 

promoveu um aumento dose-dependente na viabilidade/proliferação celular dos 

osteoblastos, no entanto resultados opostos foram encontrados nas culturas de 

HDMEC. Já nas co-culturas o padrão de viabilidade/proliferação celular apresentou um 



 

vi 
 

ligeiro aumento. As partículas eram facilmente internalizadas por ambos os tipos 

celulares, contudo as células endoteliais apresentaram uma maior percentagem de 

vesículas intracelulares carregadas com nanopartículas. As co-culturas de células 

osteoblásticas e endoteliais apresentaram menor internalização de partículas, em 

comparação com as respectivas monoculturas. Os efeitos descritos, causados pela 

presença de nanopartículas de HA, foram mais significativos quando estas eram 

adicionadas no início da cultura. 

Os resultados obtidos sugerem que as nanopartículas de HA têm capacidade de 

modular o comportamento das células osteoblásticas e endoteliais, afectando também 

a interacção entre estes dois tipos celulares, apresentando-se como um biomaterial 

promissor para novas estratégias utilizadas pela engenharia de tecido ósseo.

INTRODUCTION

I.1. Bone biology 

 Bone is a dynamic connective tissue that performs several key functions within 

higher vertebrates. It is the material from which the skeleton is made, providing 

support and protection to the internal organs (Saladin, 2004). Besides, it provides 

attachment for muscles, facilitating the locomotion process; it is involved in the 

synthesis of blood cells and in the metabolism of mineral ions such as calcium and 

phosphorous (Morgan and Bouxsein, 2008). Throughout life, bone is continually 

changing to adapt its shape and structure to perform different tasks. This process of 

renewal happens by laying down new bone tissue and resorbing old (Einhorn, 1996; 

Hing, 2004).  

During this work, we will review the main aspects of bone biology, such as, 

bone morphogenesis and structure, bone vascularization, bone metabolic role and 

finally bone remodeling and repair.   

 

I.1.1. Bone morphogenesis  

Osteogenesis is the process through which mature bone is formed. Accordingly, 

the ossification process occurs by two different methods: intramembranous 

ossification and endochondral ossification (Seeley et al., 2004). 

The formation of flat bones like the vault of the skull, the pelvis, and the 

majority of face bones occurs by intramembranous ossification. Thus, during 

embryonic development, mesenchymal cells condensate and differentiate into 

osteoprogenitor cells, and then into osteoblasts, which line up around blood vessels 

(Marks and Hermey, 1996). At this point, all the necessary conditions to start to 

produce and deposit new bone matrix are present (Buckwalter et al., 1996a). The first 

structure to be formed is a network of trabeculae composing the cancellous bone, 

which undergoes continuous mineralization. When the osteoblasts and osteoclasts 

coupled actions begin, the trabeculae are remodeled. At the end of this process, the 



INTRODUCTION

newly formed bones present a typical arrangement: the cancellous bone is flanked by 

compact bone (Saladin, 2004; Seeley et al., 2004). 

Endochondral ossification occurs in long bones, like the bones of the vertebral 

column, the base of the skull, part of the mandible and in the appendicular skeleton, 

formed from a cartilage model (Meghji, 1992; Buckwalter et al., 1996a). Thus, 

embryonic mesenchymal cells differentiate into chondrocytes, which proliferate and 

produce a collagenous matrix, leading to the formation of a hyaline cartilage model 

(Ortega et al., 2004). 

In the interior of the cartilage model, chondrocytes undergo a progressive 

hypertrophy and the cartilage matrix becomes mineralized, leaving behind 

interconnected spaces (Marks and Hermey, 1996). Simultaneously, at the surface of 

the developing endochondral bone, the perichondrium is responsible for laying down a 

thin osteoblastic layer, surrounding the diaphysis, named periosteal collar (Marks and 

Hermey, 1996). 

From this moment on, primary ossification takes place. Therefore, blood vessels 

invade the central region of the mineralized and hypertrophied cartilage, taking with it 

osteoprogenitor cells and osteoblastic precursors, responsible for osteoblastic 

differentiation, and therefore bone formation (Marks and Hermey, 1996; Scotti et al., 

2010). At the same time, osteoclastic invading cells resorb the central part of the 

cartilage leading to the formation of a marrow cavity (Buckwalter et al., 1996a). 

The epiphysis of a long bone and, the extremities of irregular and flat bones, 

are formed by secondary ossification. Separating the epiphysis from the diaphysis is a 

newly formed structure named epiphysial or growth plate. This specific area is 

responsible for chondrocytes segregation, proliferation and hypertrophy, resulting in 

longitudinal bone growth, until skeletal maturity, when the diaphysis and epiphysis 

fuse with each other (Marks and Hermey, 1996; Ortega et al., 2004).  

A proper vascular network is also important to ensure the transportation of 

oxygen, nutrients, several cells and soluble factors, necessary to the skeletal 

homeostasis. The modification of this homeostasis leads to several bone pathologies,

such as osteomyelitis, osteonecrosis and osteoporosis, caused by abnormal blood 

supply (Carmeliet, 2003). 

Angiogenesis is a biological process through which new vessels sprout from pre-

existing ones, bridge and growth until a new functional structure is formed (Vander et 

al., 2001a).  During bone formation, the angiogenic process is important to the 

intramembranous and endochondral ossification. Thus, the vascular invasion into the 

mesenchymal zone during intramembranous ossification and the vascular supply to 

the growth plate during endochondral ossification, are essential to a complete process 

(Saladin, 2004). Moreover, during fracture repair neoangiogenesis occurs until vascular 

supply returns to normal (Carano and Filvaroff, 2003). 

The normal angiogenic process is regulated by several factors, like vascular 

endothelial growth factor (VEGF); basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF); various 

members of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-?) family; hypoxia-inducible 

transcription factor (HIF) and angiopoietins 1 (Ang-1) (Kanczler and Oreffo, 2008). The 

VEGFs are important growth factors since they are involved in the regulation of 

vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, and also play an important role in bone growth and 

repair (Carano and Filvaroff, 2003). The main effects of VEGFs are on endothelial cells, 

but the VEGF receptors are also expressed on monocytes, chondrocytes and 

osteoblasts. Moreover, besides the angiogenic effects, VEGFs can induce 

haematopoietic stem cell recruitment from bone marrow, monocyte chemoattraction, 

neural protection and bone formation (Ferrara and Davis-Smyth, 1997). 

 

I.1.2. Bone structure 

The overall structure of the bone is composed of two different types of 

organization: compact or cortical bone and, cancellous or trabecular bone. While the 

first type is relatively dense and is found at the bone surface, functioning as a 

protection in mechanically demanding regions, cancellous bone consists in a network 

of trabeculae surrounding interconnected spaces and it is found in the interior of 

bones (Fig. 1) (Tartaglia and Waugh, 2002a). 



INTRODUCTION

Compact bone represents 80% of the mature skeleton, distributed by the long 

bones diaphysis and surrounding the majority of bones (Pratt, 1991). It is constituted 

by quasi-cilindrical elements called osteons or Harvesian systems, which are formed by 

densely packed collagen fibrils called lamellae (Rossert and Crombrugghe, 1996).   Each 

of these structures presents a central lumen containing a blood vessel responsible for 

the vascular supply along the axis of a long bone. Moreover, compact bone also has 

transversal blood vessels, perpendicular to the axis of a long bone, located in 

Volkmann canals, as well as capillaries and venules from microcirculation and, 

occasionally, a nerve fiber (Seeley et al., 2004).

and cancellous bone with trabeculae. Periosteum (inner and outer layer) and endosteum representation 

(Adapted from Seeley et al., 2004).   

Cancellous bone is also called spongy bone, because of the porous appearance 

created by the network of trabeculae. It exists within the cortical bone, in the central 

region of flat and irregular bones such as vertebrae, skull and pelvic bones but also in 

the long bones mataphysis and epiphysis (Pratt, 1991). Despite its porous appearance, 

cancellous bone has a structural support function, since its trabeculae are oriented by 

stress and tension lines in the interior of the bone. As well as compact bone, 

cancellous bone matrix is organized in lamellae, without a complete osteon

organization (Saladin, 2004). Furthermore, this type of bone filled by blood vessels, 

bone marrow cells and adipocytes is related with cellular functions presenting a high 

metabolic rate (Buckwalter et al., 1996b). 

Whether it is compact or cancellous, bone has layers of connective tissue and 

bone forming cells covering its external and internal surfaces, namely the periosteum 

and the endosteum. Furthermore, as a connective tissue, bone is constituted by the 

extracellular matrix, with organic and inorganic components, functioning as a scaffold 

for the different types of bone cells (Seeley et al., 2004). 

 

I.1.2.1. Periosteum and endosteum  

Periosteum is the external coating of the majority of bone surfaces, present in 

locations of high risk of fracture and, absent from tendon, articular surfaces and, 

ligament insertions (Allen et al., 2004). The periosteum is attached to the bone by 

collagen fibers, also called Sharpey’s fibers oriented by tension forces that penetrate 

into the bone promoting a tight junction between bone tissue and the periosteum 

(Saladin, 2004; Junqueira and Carneiro, 2005).  

 Periosteum is described as a fibro-vascular membrane that is composed by an 

external layer, named fibrous layer and, an inner layer called osteogenic layer (Fig. 1) 

(Allen et al., 2004). The fibrous layer of the periosteum is composed by numerous 

fibroblasts with collagen and elastin fibers, associated in a microvascular network. The 

inner osteogenic layer is formed by osteogenic progenitor cells which differentiate into 

osteoblasts. This part of the periosteum is responsible for the diaphysis diameter 

increase and for fracture regeneration, since cellular growth occurs by layers (Dwek, 

2010). 

Endosteum is a single-celled membrane formed by osteoprogenitor cells and 

hematopoietic stem cells (Balduino et al., 2005). It is the inner coating of all bone 

cavities, such as, the medullary cavity of long bones diaphysis and the trabecullae in 

cancellous bone (Fig. 1) (Seeley et al., 2004; Mescher, 2010). 



INTRODUCTION 

6 
 

These two types of connective tissue, intimately connected with bone, are 

directly involved in bone growth and regeneration during fracture repair, acting as a 

continuous source of bone cells (Junqueira and Carneiro, 2005). 

 

I.1.2.2. Bone matrix 

The bone extracellular matrix has two main components: the organic matrix 

and the inorganic matrix. The organic matrix, composed by collagen and non-

collagenous proteins, accounts for 35% of the total weight of bone tissue compared 

with 65% for the inorganic components (Ca
2+

 and PO4
3-

) (Buckwalter et al., 1996b). 

The organic extracellular matrix major component is collagen type I (COL I), a 

bone structural protein responsible for bone’s wide range of mechanical properties 

(Rossert and Crombrugghe, 1996). 

Composing one collagen molecule structure are three polypeptide chains 

organized in a triple helix. Each chain is made by a sequence of aminoacids with high 

content in glycin, prolin and hydroxyproline. COL I is composed of two ?1 chains and 

one ?2 chain, being each type of chain coded by two different genes (Van Der Rest and 

Garrone, 1991; Rossert and Crombrugghe, 1996; Cowles et al., 1998). 

Procollagen is the synthesized form of collagen, formed by triple helix ? chains, 

which will have their N- and C-propeptides removed by specific proteases. These 

changes promote the molecules assembling into a fibril form, displayed in a 

overlapping manner with spaces between adjacent fibrils. The intermolecular 

crosslinks formed have a very high tensile strength functioning as a scaffold for bone 

growth (Eyer, 1996; Rossert and Crombrugghe, 1996).The fibrillar collagens group is 

composed by: type I, type II, type III, type V, type XI, type XXIV and type XXVII collagen 

forms (Van Der Rest and Garrone, 1991; Bou-Gharios and Crombrugghe, 2008).  

The remainder part of the organic matrix is composed by non-collagenous 

proteins such as glycoproteins, proteoglycans and several other exogenous proteins 

with important biological activity in the bone (Cowles et al., 1998). Table 1 gives an 

overview of bone matrix main non-collagenous components, as well as their function 

in bone tissue.

INTRODUCTION

The inorganic phase of the bone is mainly composed by calcium and 

phosphorous ions, organized in a calcium phosphate compound, named 

hydroxyapatite (HA, Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) (Marks and Hermey, 1996).  These mineral 

crystals, with plate-like shape, are deposited by cellular control into the extracellular 

matrix, between adjacent collagen fibrils, originating the strength and stiffness of bone 

(Olszta et al., 2007; Orimo, 2010). In addition to calcium and phosphorous there are 

other ions, found in minor percentage in bone, such as bicarbonate, potassium, 

sodium, magnesium and citrate (Buckwalter et al.,1996b). 

 

I.1.2.3. Bone cells  

Throughout life, bone cells play an important role in bone maintenance, 

through their capability to synthesize and resorb the extracellular matrix. The cells 

responsible for these events are: osteoblasts, osteocytes, bone linning cells and 

osteoclasts (Fig. 2). 

 

Figure 2. The origins and location of bone cells: osteoblasts, osteoclasts, osteocytes and bone lining 

cells (Adapted from Marks and Hermey, 1996). 

Bone cells have different origins (Fig. 2). Osteocytes, osteoblasts and bone 

linning cells are derived from undifferentiated pluripotent mesenchymal cells, located 

in bone marrow, endosteum and periosteum (Buckwalter et al., 1996b). Proliferation 

and differentiation of mesenchymal cells are under influence of hormones and growth 

factors, determining the type of cells formed during differentiation. Thus, 



INTRODUCTION

mesenchymal cells can differentiate into osteoblasts, chondroblasts, adipocytes, 

myoblasts and fibroblasts (Triffitt, 1996). Osteoclasts belong to the monocyte-

macrophage lineage, being the final product of hemopoietic lineage (Suda et al., 1996). 

Located at the formation and remodeling zones of bone, are osteoblasts – bone 

forming cells – responsible for synthesize and secret unmineralized bone matrix, called 

osteoid (Cowin and Doty, 2007). Moreover, osteoblasts are also involved in the 

mineralization process of bone matrix (Aubin and Lui, 1996; Orimo, 2010).  

 Active osteoblasts are mononucleated, cuboidal cells tightly packed along bone 

surface, with a prominent Golgi apparatus, well-developed rough endoplasmatic 

reticulum, and large quantities of mitochondria (Marks and Hermey, 1996; Junqueira 

and Carneiro, 2005). This type of bone cell is responsible for the synthesis of bone 

matrix proteins, such as COL I and noncollagenous proteins, that are stored in vesicles 

and then released to the extracellular space, by exocytosis. Additionally, bone matrix 

become calcified when osteoblasts secrete vesicles filled with calcium ions (Ca
2+

) and 

phosphate ions (PO4
2-

), promoting HA crystals formation and deposition throughout 

the osteoid (Gay et al., 2000; Seeley, 2004; Orimo, 2010). By the time that the matrix 

synthesis process is over, inactive osteoblasts flatten, acting as a protective layer of the 

newly formed bone (Junqueira and Carneiro, 2005). 

 During bone formation, certain osteoblasts become surrounded by bone 

matrix and differentiate into osteocytes (Cowin and Doty, 2007). Thus, osteocytes are 

smaller than osteoblasts presenting dendritic shape, oval nucleus and few cytoplasm, 

less prominent endoplasmatic reticulum and smaller Golgi apparatus (Marks and 

Hermey, 1996). Mature osteocyte occupies the matrix lacunae, and communicates 

with neighboring osteocytes, as well as, bone surface and blood vessels, through 

filipodia connections, ensuring the access to oxygen and nutrients (Nijweide et al., 

1996). Besides, osteocytes function as strain detectors and consequently coordinate 

osteoblasts and osteoclasts activity, when bone remodeling is needed (Saladin, 2004). 

Bone lining cells are inactive osteoblasts, located at bone surface, at zones 

where bone is not under formation or resorption (Marks and Hermey, 1996). These 

cells are flat and elongated, presenting a spindle-shaped nucleus, and fewer 



INTRODUCTION 

10 
 

cytoplasmatic organelles (Cowin and Doty, 2007). Additionally, Everts and colleagues 

have proposed that bone lining cells in vitro are responsible for: 1) “cleaning” bone 

surface from nonmineralized collagen fibrils before osteoclastic attachment; 2) for 

digesting the collagen left by osteoclasts after resorption ; 3) form a cement line and 

deposit a thin layer of fibrillar collagen on the cleaned surfaces (Everts et al., 2002).  

The fourth cellular component of bone is the osteoclasts (Fig. 3), a large (20-

100 µm), multinucleated (2 to 50 nucleus) cell. The main function of this type of cell is 

to resorb bone, dentin and calcified cartilage (Marks and Hermey, 1996).  

Osteoclasts have their polarity changed during the resorption cycle. Thus 

resorbing osteoclast is highly polarized, when compared with nonresorbing osteoclast 

(Väänänen, 1996). When resorption sites are determined, osteoclasts attach to bone 

surface, through a specific membrane domain named sealing zone, which delimits 

other membrane domain - the ruffled border. This specific zone, with its finger-like 

projections, is where the bone matrix demineralization and degradation process take 

place (Saladin, 2004; Mescher, 2010). The ruffled border creates an acidic environment 

between the osteoclasts and the matrix causing HA crystals dissolution, consequently 

forming resorption lacunae, named Howship’s lacunae (Väänänen and Zhao, 2008). 

After matrix demineralization, degradation of collagenous matrix happens with the 

ruffled border secreting several proteinases, such as metalloproteinases (MMPs) and 

lysossomal cysteine proteinases (Kusano et al., 1998; Delaisse et al., 2000).Additionally 

to those mentioned membrane domains, osteoclasts have a homogeneous membrane, 

known as basolateral membrane, and a secretory domain that function as a site for the 

resorbed products exocytose (Väänänen et al., 2000).

lacunae is formed (Adapted from Junqueira and Carneiro, 2005). 

 

I.1.3. Bone vascularization  

The presence of blood vessels in bone tissue is very important in cases of bone 

growth, bone healing, fracture repair and osteogenesis. A proper blood supply is 

necessary to maintain bone vitality, and to sustain bone and bone marrow cells 

function, through oxygen and nutrients input and metabolic waste products output 

(Shim, 1968). 

Blood supply in long bones is made by several arteries, which penetrate the 

bone cortexes in different locations: in the diaphysis, in the metaphysis and in the 

epiphysis. Hence, there are the nutrient artery, the metaphysial artery, the epiphysial 

artery, and periosteal vessels that carry arterial blood to the bone. This group of 

arteries is interconnected by longitudinal anastomoses creating a network around the 

diaphysis and metaphysis (Tartaglia and Waugh, 2002b).  

Bone supply is made by centrifugal flow, meaning that arterial blood goes first 

to the medullary cavities and then flows to the outer cortex through the arteries that 

arise inside the Haver’s and Volkmann’s canals. This group of vessels is responsible for 

blood supply to the inner 2/3 of the cortex, while the periosteal vessels supply the 

outer third (Al-Motabagani, 2002; Travlos, 2006). 



INTRODUCTION 

12 
 

Along the diaphysis axis, there is a sinus that drains into veins: metaphysial 

vein, epiphysial vein and centromedullary veins. This group of veins runs in parallel 

with the arteries, and carries venous blood out of the bone (Laroche, 2002; Tartaglia 

and Waugh, 2002b).  

 

I.1.4. Bone tissue metabolic role  

Bone tissue contains 99% of total body calcium and, some of the most 

important functions of this tissue are the storage and regulation of its homeostasis 

(Buckwalter et al., 1996b; Marks and Hermey, 1996; Cowin and Doty, 2007). The 

balance of calcium in the body, through calcium diffusion in and out of the bone, is 

regulated by numerous factors. Local factors including cytokines, growth factors and 

prostaglandins, and calcitropic hormones, such as, parathyroid, vitamin D and 

calcitonin, are involved in bone-cell functions (Marks and Hermey, 1996; Buckwalter et 

al., 1996a). However, calcium homeostasis depends not only on the bone and on the 

referred factors, but also on kidneys and the gastrointestinal track (Vander et al., 

2001b). Accordingly, bone mineralization occurs only when calcium and phosphorous 

levels in the blood are sufficient for bone normal deposition (Saladin, 2004). 

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) has direct effect in bone tissue, since it stimulates 

osteoclastic function and therefore, the release of calcium from bone to the 

bloodstream (Buckwalter et al., 1996a; Fitzpatrick and Bilezikian, 1999).  In addition, 

PTH controls calcium resorption by the kidneys and promotes vitamin D synthesis 

(Buckwalter et al., 1996a). 

Vitamin D final form (1,25-didydroxyvitamin D3), is synthesized in the kidneys 

depending on the levels of serum calcium (Buckwalter et al., 1996a; Rossert and 

Crombrugghe, 1996). Despite having several actions in different cells and tissues, 

vitamin D is primarily associated with bone function and mineral homeostasis 

(Fitzpatrick and Bilezikian, 1999). It has an inductive effect in bone resorption, by 

promoting the differentiation of osteoclastic precursors into active osteoclasts (Suda et 

al., 1996; Saladin, 2004). Moreover, vitamin D inhibits PTH synthesis and secretion, and 



INTRODUCTION 

13 
 

plays an important role in enhancing calcium absorption in the intestine (Fitzpatrick 

and Bilezikian, 1999; Goltzman et al., 2004). 

Calcitonin, produced and secreted by the parafollicular cells of thyroid gland, is 

responsible for the decrease of calcium serum levels, since it has an inhibitory effect 

on osteoclasts (Chambers, 1991; Buckwalter et al., 1996a). The regulatory function of 

calcitonin is amplified during ‘’calcium stress’’ periods, such as, growth, pregnancy, and 

lactation, therefore protecting the skeleton from excessive resorption (Vander et al., 

2001b). These important features have been taken into account in several studies, 

where the therapeutic utility of calcitonin in the treatment of metabolic bone diseases, 

like Paget disease, hypercalcemia and osteoporosis, is investigated (Buckwalter et al., 

1996a; Vander et al., 2001b). 

Bone cell function can be influenced by other hormones, such as, 

glucocorticoids, thyroid hormone and estrogens. An important function of 

glucocorticoids in bone metabolism is its inhibitory effect on bone matrix production 

by the osteoblasts. Thyroid hormones, thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine, enhance bone 

osteoclastic resorption. Finally, estrogens have a major role in bone maintenance since 

inhibit osteoclastic function. Thus, clinically, it is known that bone loss in 

postmenopausal females is associated with decreased estrogen levels (Buckwalter et 

al., 1996a; Suda et al., 1996).  

Local factors, including cytokines, growth factors and prostaglandins affect cell-

to-cell and cell-to-extracellular matrix interactions. Cytokines and growth factors 

mediate cell-to-cell interaction within bone, regulating several features of bone cells 

during skeletal development and in the remodeling process of the mature skeleton. 

Prostaglandins regulate a diverse group of biological processes, including 

inflammation, blood flow and, ion transport across cell membranes. Additionally, 

prostaglandins promote formation and proliferation of osteoclasts and, subsequently 

have a positive regulation on bone resorption (Rossert and Crombrugghe, 1996; 

Buckwalter et al., 1996a; Lorenzo and Raisz, 1999). 

 



INTRODUCTION

I.1.5. Bone remodeling 

Bone is a specialized tissue responsible for body protection and locomotion. To 

play these functions, bone has to be capable to respond and adapt to several 

mechanical stresses (Einhorn, 1996; Hill, 1998). 

Bone remodeling is a process of continuous bone shaping through replacement 

of old bone by new tissue, involving the coupled actions of bone resorbing and bone 

forming cells (Buckwalter et al., 1996a; Lemaire et al., 2004). This adaptive 

phenomenon also occurs to repair microdamage caused by repeated physical stresses 

and loads (Lemaire et al., 2004). Therefore, during bone remodeling, differentiated 

osteoclasts are induced to resorb bone on a particular surface, being replaced by 

osteoblasts responsible for bone formation. This process is played by an association of 

bone cells and bone extracellular matrix, designated basic multicellular units (BMUs), 

which act geographically and chronologically separated from other BMUs keeping 

bone morphology unchanged  (Hill, 1998; Raggatt and Partridge, 2010).  

The triggering signal that attracts osteoclastic precursors to the microdamage 

site, to start the remodeling process, is not completely understood, but seems to be 

associated with osteocyte signalization through their canaliculi network along the bone 

after a structural damage or with bone cell response to an unusual hormonal level 

(Hill, 1998; Seeman, 2008). When mature osteoclasts are at the resorption site, 

osteoclastogenesis begin with the renewal of the damage, creating a resorption bay in 

the bone tissue. After the maximum resorption pick, osteoclasts undergo apoptosis 

and osteoblastic precursors are attracted to the lacunae by TGF-? and COL I released 

from the digested matrix. Then the osteoblastic precursors differentiate into 

osteoblasts that start bone formation until the lacunae is totally filled (Hill, 1998; 

Raggatt and Partridge, 2010). 

Moreover, the two bone remodeling events – osteoblastogenesis and 

osteoclastogenesis – are dependent on several mechanisms involving cytokines, 

growth factors, hormones and vitamins. A group of different cytokines namely 

macrophage colony stimulating factors (M-CSF) and receptor activator of nuclear 



INTRODUCTION 

15 
 

factor ? B ligand (RANKL), are directly related with osteoclasts differentiation, survival 

and expansion and, thus, with bone resorption. M-CSF and RANKL are both expressed 

by osteoblasts, and have their receptors on the surface of osteoclastic precursor cells, 

namely c-fms and receptor activator of nuclear factor ? B (RANK). The binding of these 

cytokines to its receptors is the signalizing mechanism necessary to osteoclasts 

activation and differentiation (Udagawa et al., 2000; Proff and Römer, 2009). 

Additionally, osteoblasts also express a soluble decoy receptor for RANKL named 

osteoprotegerin (OPG), which prevents RANK – RANKL connection and inhibits 

osteoclasts differentiation, blocking bone resorption. The OPG – RANKL – RANK 

balance is so important to bone homeostasis, that several alterations on this system 

are related to human metabolic bone diseases (Yavropoulou and Yovos, 2008; Kohli 

and Kohli, 2011). 

 

I.2. Bone repair 

When exposed to an injury, usually a fracture, bone tissue reacts spontaneously 

by remodeling itself, through several biological events, until the normal function and 

morphology are completely restored. However, there are special cases, such as large 

fractures, bone defects, or even pathological conditions, where this natural faculty is 

not enough to regenerate the injured tissue, and so several alternative strategies 

should be taken in order to repair bone tissue (Kumar et al., 2007a; Dimitriou et al., 

2011). 

 

I.2.1. Spontaneous bone repair 

As a living tissue, bone has the ability to regenerate in response to fractures, 

although it is unique in its scarless response (Carano and Filvaroff, 2003). The repair 

process involves several cell types, including macrophages, polymorphonuclear 

leukocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells and osteoblasts (Marsh and Li, 1999). 



INTRODUCTION 

16 
 

In response to fracture, there is a cell and tissue reaction, namely an 

inflammation phase preceding proliferative and remodeling phases (Carano and 

Filvaroff, 2003). When bone tissue is fractured, there is a bleeding and initially a blood 

clot is formed. Blood vessels permeability and volume change as a response to 

inflammation and as a consequence of vasodilatation several proteins, growth factors 

and cytokines arrive to the fracture site triggering the influx of inflammatory cells. At 

the fracture gap, bone cells and bone matrix are phagocyted and substituted by 

granulation tissue. This provisory tissue is continuously replaced by fibro-cartilage 

leading to a soft callus formation around the fracture site. Subsequently, the 

periosteum osteogenic potential allows new bone cell formation and, as a result, bone 

tissue is formed in the internal and external layer of the callus, creating a hard callus 

(Marsh and Li, 1999; Seeley, 2004). The remodeling phase of bone regeneration is 

characterized by fracture callus replacement by stronger lamellar bone, until normal 

bone morphology and total blood supply are restored (Fig. 4) (Marsh and Li, 1999; 

Carano and Filvaroff, 2003). 

However, in cases of large bone fractures or defects, in pathological conditions 

(e.g. tumors, bacterial infections, osteonecrosis), in age related disorders like 

osteoporosis, and in other cases of large bone loss, bone tissue is not capable to 

restore its shape and function spontaneously (Seeley et al., 2004; Kumar et al., 2007a). 

To restore bone health, shape and function, surgical reconstruction is needed. 

Therefore, the proper strategy and bone substitute must be chosen.

Hard callus formation: the callus becomes mineralized; (d) Bone remodeling: the large fracture callus is 

replaced with secondary lamellar bone, and the vascular supply returns to normal (Adapted from 

Carano and Filvaroff, 2003). 

 

I.2.2. Strategies for bone repair 

Bone grafting is the current treatment used to enhance bone repair process, in 

cases that bone cannot do it spontaneously. Thus, it can be made by replacing missing 

bone for natural material, either from the patient’s own skeletal (autografting) or that 

of a donor (allografting), or for man-made synthetic materials (Finkemeier, 2002; 

Salgado et al., 2004a). 

To restore bone architecture and functionality two different strategies can be 

taken: 1) transplantation or 2) implantation (Hench, 1998). 

Bone transplantation is the surgical procedure through which healthy and 

functional bone tissue is harvested to fill the skeletal defect. While bone autografting is 

the process used when bone tissue that fills the defect is from the patient’s own 

skeletal, bone allografting is used to fill the defect with bone tissue from living donors 

or cadavers (Porter et al., 2009; Dimitriou et al., 2011). 

Despite being currently used to treat bone defects, autografting has some 

limitations. The amount of harvested tissue and the donor site pain and morbidity are 

the main barriers to this procedure (Laurencin et al., 1999). Also, bone allografting, is 

less used than autografting because, it has some risk concerning the possibility to 

induce host immune response or disease transmission (Salgado et al., 2004a ; Porter et 

al., 2009). 

To overcome the difficulties of bone autografting and allografting, implantation 

of man-made biomaterials appears to be the alternative therapy to treat bone defects 

(Hench, 1998). Either way, the material used to adequately treat bone tissue loss, 

should have certain properties, such as: biocompatibility, osteoconductivity and 

osteoinductivity. Hence, bone substitute should not incite an inflammatory response 

(biocompatibility), it should provide the adequate matrix to support bone cell 



INTRODUCTION 

18 
 

attachment and growth (osteoconductivity), and it also should be capable of stimulate 

cells to become bone forming cells (osteoinductivity) (Middleton and Tripton, 2000; 

Albrektsson and Johansson, 2001; Finkemeier, 2002; Porter et al., 2009).  

In order to achieve an ideal bone graft substitute, capable of restore bone 

functionality and structure, Bone Tissue Engineering (BTE) arises as a promise to the 

future of regenerative medicine (Salgado et al., 2004a; Schieker et al., 2006).  

 

I.2.2.1 Bone Tissue Engineering 

BTE is presented as an alternative to bone transplantation. It relies on the 

association of osteoconductive scaffolds, made of biocompatible materials, with cells 

and osteoinductive growth factors, attempting to mimic natural bone (Schieker et al., 

2006). Research groups try to combine knowledge from biology, physics, engineering 

and materials science, in order to create a dynamic structure capable of restore, 

maintain or improve tissue function, structure and biochemical behavior (Hench, 1998; 

Salgado et al., 2004b). 

One of the major challenges in BTE concerns the creation of vascularized grafts. 

Indeed, if the main goal is to create a construct capable of mimicking natural bone, 

vasculature to provide oxygen and nutrients to the engineered tissue is of the most 

importance (Rivron et al., 2008). After implantation of the scaffold the spontaneous 

invasion of new blood vessels is to slow and insufficient, and the deeper tissues 

became deprived of oxygen and nutrients compromising the survival of the engineered 

construct. 

Accordingly, several attempts to provide proper blood supply to the construct 

are in course. These strategies include: 1) scaffold design, which allows to choose the 

ideal pore size and pores interconnectivity essential to the correct host cell migration 

and assembling in a microvascular network for the entire implanted construct; 2) a 

technique that combines the angiogenic effects of growth factors, such as, VEGF and 

bFGF to induce the ingrowth of host vessels into the construct, named angiogenic 

factor delivery; 3) in vivo prevascularization based on prior implantation of the 



INTRODUCTION 

19 
 

engineered construct in a region with an artery and after total vascularization, the 

construct is harvested and reimplanted at the defect site; 4) in vitro prevascularization 

that combines the construct cells with endothelial cells to create a new vascular 

network. After formation of a prevascular network in vitro the construct is implanted 

and the host vasculature anastomoses with it (Rouwkema et al., 2008; Rivron et al., 

2008). 

Ultimately, the combined results of each technique will provide the necessary 

information to create a successful construct with functional and mature blood vessels 

during the construct life time.   

 

I.2.2.1.1. Biomaterials 

In 2009, Williams proposed a new definition of biomaterial as being “a 

substance that has been engineered to take a form which, alone or as part of a 

complex system, is used to direct, by control of interactions with components of living 

systems, the course of any therapeutic or diagnostic procedure, in human or veterinary 

medicine”.  

In BTE, bone substitutes used to treat bone defects and help bone healing 

process have in their composition biomaterials. Furthermore, and as mentioned 

earlier, the ideal biomaterial that composes the engineered construct should be 

biocompatible, osteoconductive and osteoinductive.  It also should be able to support 

mechanical loads and be bioactive and bioresorbable. Meaning that, it should promote 

neotissue formation while it degrades, allowing the substitution of the scaffold for 

newly formed bone (Navarro et al., 2008; Dorozhkin, 2010). 

Metals, polymers and ceramics are the usual biomaterials that can be used as a 

scaffold for BTE. 

Metals and metal alloys such as, stainless steel, titanium, titanium alloys, 

aluminium, among others are used as permanent implants in large load bearing 



INTRODUCTION 

20 
 

defects. However, metal is a bioinert material and that characteristic excludes its direct 

use as a scaffold in BTE (Navarro et al., 2008). 

As an alternative, there are bioactive and bioresorbable polymers from 

synthetic or natural sources. Some of the currently used polymers are: polyglycolic acid 

(PGA), Poly (?-caprolaction) (PLC), polydioxanone (PDS), polylactide acid (PLA), 

hyaluronic acid, chitosan, alginats, collagen and others (Navarro et al., 2008). The use 

of these materials to do scaffolds in BTE relies in the fact that the polymer degradation 

rate can be controlled assigning high versatility to this biomaterial (Schieker et al., 

2006). 

Ceramics such as glass ceramics and calcium phosphates are also adequate 

biomaterials used to compose scaffolds due to their biocompatibility, 

osteoconductivity, osteoinductivity and high similarities with bone mineralized matrix. 

Furthermore, ceramics are bioactive and bioresorbable materials. One of the most 

used ceramics in BTE is HA (Dorozhkin, 2010; Nandi et al., 2010).  

HA ceramics have different clinical applications in various forms: particles, 

injectable compositions, coatings on metal implants, dense or porous blocks, 

composites with polymers, among others. HA is often selected as biomaterial for BTE 

because it acts as stable phase, with lower solubility and therefore slower resorption 

rate, under normal physiological conditions. Additionally, it seems that HA is the ideal 

biomaterial to attract bone forming cells to seed, differentiate and assemble in the 

scaffold. However, scaffold properties, as surface area, roughness and porosity that 

greatly influence bone forming cells behavior, along with a poor fatigue resistance, 

which inhibits the use of HA scaffolds to load bearing applications, are problems to 

overcome (Cai and Tang, 2008; Dorozhkin, 2010).  

 Thus, taking into account the current progress in the nanotechnology field, 

there have been advances in the synthesis and study of nanoHA applied to BTE (Table 

2). In fact, several methods have been used to synthesize HA nanoparticles, including 

hydrothermal synthesis, co-precipitation, microemulsion and sol-gel, in order to mimic 

bone natural crystals, in shape, dimensions and composition (Zhang and Gonçalves, 

1997; Kweh et al., 1999; Kim et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2006).  



INTRODUCTION 

21 
 

NanoHA resemblance with natural bone minerals enhances the bioceramics 

biological and mechanical role. It is also known that nanosized materials (&lt;100 nm) 

have large surface-to-volume ratio, which means that the smaller the particle the 

greater the surface area. Additionally, compared to microstructured particles, nanoHA 

particles present higher surface roughness and smaller porosity, which positively 

influence osteoinduction, osteoblastic functions and the interactions between the 

surface and serum proteins (Dorozhkin, 2009; Zhou and Lee, 2011).  

Several studies performed on osteoblastic cells with microHA and nanoHA have 

demonstrated the advantages in the use of nanoparticles. Thus, it has been proved 

that nanoHA is an adequate material to work in BTE, because it enhances the cellular 

response, promoting higher cellular adhesion, proliferation, migration, as well as, 

matrix mineralization around the implant, known as osseointegration, when compared 

to microHA (Guo et al., 2007; Shi et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2010; Laranjeira et al., 2010; 

El-Fattah et al., 2010). The incoming information about the role of nanoHA reveals the 

importance of this biomaterial in future clinical application.

of the biomaterial. In sum, in vitro studies are performed to understand the material 

biological performance (Teixeira et al., 2009). 

During in vitro studies for BTE, several types of cells can be chosen. Table 3 

gives an overview about the main cell types used during in vitro studies for BTE. Bone 

forming cells, named osteoblasts, are major actors during bone remodeling and repair 

process, whereat it is important to study the osteoblastic behavior in the presence of 

biomaterials. Additionally, taking the importance of scaffold vascularization into 

account, in vitro studies with isolated endothelial cells or co-culture of osteoblasts and 

endothelial cells, may also provide important information about the scaffold 

development for BTE (Grellier et al., 2009).

Osteoblasts 

MG-63 cells, osteoblasts-like cells from a human osteosarcoma cell line, are 

often used as cellular models to test the biomaterial biocompatibility (Schwartz et al., 

1999; Zhang et al., 2010; Ko et al., 2011). Despite being derived from malignant bone 

tumor, MG-63 cells are currently used during biomaterials in vitro tests, because they 

are easy to culture, present a high proliferation rate and have a long life-span 

(Notingher et al., 2004). In addition, this cell line has osteoblastic features, such as, 

polygonal shape with filipodia extensions, and expresses several specific osteoblastic 

differentiation markers, such as ALP, COL I, Runx-2, OC, OPG, BMP-2 and M-CSF genes 

(Laranjeira et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2010). 

Endothelial cells 

ECs are the main component of the inner layer of every blood vessel in the 

body. These cells are directly involved in the process of new blood vessels formation

(angiogenesis), as well as, during immune and inflammatory responses (Kumar et al., 

2007b). It is worth to notice that these events happen during scaffold pre-

vascularization processes or after scaffold implantation in the body (Rouwkema et al., 

2008). Regarding this, in vitro studies allow us to have more information about the 

scaffold biocompatibility, as well as, cell performance when in contact with the 

biomaterial.  

Human dermal microvascular ECs (HDMEC), isolated from juvenile foreskin are 

often used during in vitro testes (Unger et al., 2007; Peters et al., 2008; Santos et al., 

2009). In vitro, these cells present the typical polygonal and elongated shape. 

Furthermore, HDMEC can be identified by imunohistochemestry, using antibodies for 

endothelial markers, such as, adherens molecules (e.g. VE-cadherin) and platelet-

endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM or CD31), which also proves the polygonal 

shape of these cells (Peters et al., 2008).  

Co-culture system 

In order to create a metabolic-active bone graft, with proper vascular network 

allowing metabolic waste products removal, as well as, the access to nutrients, oxygen, 

precursor cells and biological mediators, it is relevant to understand the importance of 

cellular interactions between osteoblastic cells and ECs (Rivron et al., 2008; Grellier et 

al., 2009). Thus, in vitro co-culture system with heterogeneous cell types provides 

significant information about in vivo interactions between cells.  

Accordingly, communication between osteoblasts and ECs can happen in two 

ways: 1) diffusion of soluble factors produced by one of the cell types which will 

activate a specific receptor on the target cell, or 2) direct cytoplasmatic contact 

through gap junctions. In the first case, osteoblasts and ECs produce growth factors 

which affect the growth and differentiation of both cell types (Grellier et al., 2009). 

Examples of these growth factors produced are VEGF produced by osteoblasts and 

affecting ECs, as well as, BMP-2 and IGF produced by ECs to influence osteoblasts 

proliferation and differentiation (Rivron et al., 2008). The other type of communication 

(gap junctions) allows a direct signalizing process through cytoplasmatic connective 

channels, which allow the passage of second messengers. These messengers that will 



INTRODUCTION 

26 
 

affect gene expression on the adjacent cell are molecules, such as cAMP, cGMP, Ca2+ 

and others (Grellier et al., 2009). 

Regarding this issue, several studies have shown that the communication 

between cells during in vitro co-culture system, influence the behavior of both cell 

types. In fact, it has been observed upregulation of COL I and enhanced VEGF 

production by osteoblasts, along with the increased viability and proliferation of ECs, 

when these two cell types are cultured in direct contact (Unger et al., 2007; Hofmann 

et al., 2008). Furthermore, studies involving co-culture in 3-D scaffolds demonstrated 

the ECs ability to self-assemble into stable microvessel-like structures with lumen, 

surrounded by osteoblasts during long term periods (Unger et al., 2007; Hofmann et 

al., 2008; Santos et al., 2009a). In sum, the knowledge of cell behavior in co-culture 

systems motivate further studies about cell-to-cell communication and the advantages 

of this system to properly mimic the in vivo environment concerning bone tissue.

I.3. Objectives 

 

The experimental work presented in this thesis, aims to characterize the 

biological profile of nanohydroxyapatite (nanoHA) particles, synthesized by 

hydrothermal method, on isolated and co-cultured human osteosarcoma cell line (MG-

63) and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells. 

The in vitro studies performed assemble information about the mechanism of 

nanoHA internalization and the kinetics of nanoHA within cellular compartments. The 

effect of nanoHA in the viability/proliferation and the pattern of cell growth of isolated 

and co-cultured osteoblastic and endothelial cells were also evaluated.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS

II.1. Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles  

 

II.1.1. Hydrothermal synthesis of HA nanoparticles  

Hydrothermal synthesis (HS), carried out at 180°C was the chosen method to 

synthesize HA nanoparticles. In order to do that, a supersaturated solution was 

prepared by mixing citric acid (Riedel-deHaën, 99.5% purity), calcium nitrate (Riedel-

deHaën, 99% purity) (0.2 M) and ammonium hydrogen phosphate (Merck, 99% purity) 

(0.2 M) as follows: an aqueous citric acid solution (0.6 M) was added with small 

amounts of ammonia (Riedel-deHaën) (25 vol. %) for pH adjustment to 8.12 and then 

mixed with appropriated amounts of calcium nitrate and of ammonium hydrogen 

phosphate solutions. The mixture of all the reagents was performed under continuous 

stirring, at room temperature. The resulting homogeneous 

(calcium/citrate/phosphate) solution was transferred to a tightly sealed Teflon vessel 

in a stainless steel autoclave and kept at 180°C in an oven during 24 hours. After 24 

hours the vessel was cooled and the precipitated particles were collected by filtering 

the suspensions through a 0.22 ?m Millipore and washed repeatedly with deionized 

water. The obtained powders were dried in a desiccator. Finally, the prepared particles 

were sterilized in a stainless steel autoclave at 120°C during 20 minutes, according to a 

standard procedure in biomedical applications (Dorozhkin et al., 2000). After 

sterilization HS particles were labeled as HSster. 

 

II.1.2. Structural/chemical characterization  

The microstructure and morphological features of the HS nanoparticles, before 

and after sterilization, were evaluated with a Hitachi H-9000-NA transmission electron 

microscopy (TEM) operating at 200 kV. The particle samples for TEM observation were 

prepared by dropping an ethanolic suspension of the particles kept under ultrasonic 

stirring onto a formvar coated copper grid. The grid was subsequently air dried for 

TEM observation. 



 MATERIALS AND METHODS 

31 
 

The specific surface area (SSA) of the precipitated particles was determined by 

N2 adsorption using a Micromeritics – Gemini 2370 V5 equipment. The samples were 

thoroughly degassed at 120°C for 24 hours before nitrogen adsorption. The particle 

SSA was determined based on the multipoint Brunauer-Emmett-Teller isotherm (BET) 

(Schneider, 1995). 

The crystalline phases of the precipitated particles (HS and HSster) were 

identified by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, using an X-ray diffractometer, 

model Rigaku OMG-VH with a Cu-K? incident radiation (1.5405 Å). The diffraction 

patterns were recorded at room temperature over the 2? range of 10–70° at 3°/min, in 

continuous mode. 

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed for identifying 

the functional groups, using a Mattson Galaxy 3020 spectrophotometer. The test 

samples were prepared by mixing 2 mg of HA powder with 300 mg of spectroscopic-

grade KBr (Merck) and pressing the mixture as a disk. The infrared spectra were 

recorded in transmittance mode in the region of 4000-400 cm
?1

 with a resolution of 4 

cm
?1

.  

The measurement of the electrophoretic mobility of the particles in aqueous 

suspensions was performed at 25° C, using Malvern equipment with a zetasizer nano 

series 6.00 software. A small amount of the particles was suspended in a 2x10
-3

 M KCl 

solution in order to ensure a constant electrical double-layer thickness and then 

allowed to equilibrate for two hours before measurement.  

 

II.1.3. Preparation of different concentrations of HA nanoparticles 

In order to assess the biological profile of HSster nanoHA particles on isolated 

and co-cultured osteoblastic and endothelial cells, it was necessary to prepare 

different ranges of nanoparticles. Therefore, a suspension containing 20 mL of 

endothelial culture basal medium and 20 mg of HSster nanoHA particles was prepared 

under continuous stirring. Then, the suspension was divided in 20 rates of 1 mL each, 

which will correspond to the culture final concentration of 100 ?g mL
-1

. The other

intended nanoHA particles concentrations (1 ?g mL

and 10 ?g mL

) were prepared 

after dilution of the 100 ?g mL

suspension. 

 

II.2. Cell culture 

 

II.2.1. Monoculture of MG-63 cells  

MG-63 osteoblast-like cells were purchased to ATCC (American Type Culture 

Collection) and were cultured in Minimum Essential Medium, alpha modification (?-

MEM; Eagle) containing 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS, Sciencell), 1% ascorbic acid, 1% 

penicillin-streptomycin and 1% fungizone. The cultures were maintained until near 

confluency in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% carbon dioxide (CO2) at 37°C. 

For subculture, cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS; Gibco, UK), 

enzymatically released with trypsin solution (0.05% trypsin, 0.25% EDTA) at 37°C for 5 

minutes, and counted. Then, cells were seeded at a density of 10

cell cm
-2 

in standard 

tissue culture plates, previously coated with bovine fibronectin (made in Dulbecco’s 

phosphate buffered saline - DPBS). After 48 hours, medium was removed and fresh 

endothelial culture basal medium containing 10% of nanoHA particles, in a range of 1 

?g mL

II.2.2. Monoculture of Human Dermal Microvascular Endothelial Cells  

Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells were purchased to Sciencell and 

were cultured in Endothelial Culture basal Medium (ECM; Sciencell) containing 5% of 

FBS (Sciencell), 10 units/mL of Penicillin, 10 ?g mL
-1 

of Streptomycin (P/S solution, 

Sciencell) and endothelial cell growth supplement (ECGS, Sciencell). Incubation was 

carried out in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% carbon dioxide (CO2) at 37°C.

coated with bovine fibronectin (made in DPBS). After 48 hours, medium was replaced 

by fresh medium containing 10% of nanoHA particles (1 ?g mL

). 

 

II.2.3. Co-culture of MG-63 cells and HDMEC 

MG-63 cells and HDMEC, in passage 3, were co-cultured at a density of 10

 and 2x10

 respectively, in endothelial culture medium. After 48 hours, 

medium was removed and new medium containing 10% of nanoHA particles (1?g mL

- 

100 ?g mL
-1

) was added. Co-cultures were performed in standard culture plates, 

previously coated with bovine fibronectin (made in DPBS). 

 

Monocultures and co-cultures were maintained for 14 days at three 

experimental conditions: i) absence of nanoHA (control); ii) addition of nanoHA at day 

1 (characterization of the cultures at days 2, 7 and 14); iii) addition of nanoHA at day 7 

(characterization of the culture at days 8 and 14). Culture medium was changed 

regularly. Cell response was characterized as follow. 

 

 

II.3. Biological characterization 

 

II.3.1. Cell viability/proliferation 

MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) 

colorimetric analysis was used to estimate cell viability/proliferation in the presence of 

nanoHA (1 ?g mL
-1 

– 100 ?g mL
-1

).  

MTT assay measures the redox activity of living cells that enables the 

conversion of the yellow substrate MTT to purple needle-like formazan crystals 

accumulated at the cell surface. The solubilization of these crystals is made by 

dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), allowing the determination of absorbance values after 

incubation. The cell ability of substrate endocytosis and reduction, along with the 

intensity of the color formed, is directly related to the number of viable cells, and thus 

to their proliferation in vitro (Liu et al., 1997; Abe and Matsuki, 2000).  



 MATERIALS AND METHODS 

34 
 

For this propose cells were seeded in 96-well plates, where four replicates were set 

up for each sample (Fig. 5). At the culture periods tested (2, 7, 8 and 14 days), 10 ?L 

MTT were added to each well and incubated for 3 hours at 37°C.  Then, the MTT 

medium was discarded and the formazan salts were dissolved with 100 ?L DMSO. 

Absorbance was measured at 550 nm in a ELISA reader (Synergy HT, Biotek). 

 

II.3.2. Morphologic evaluation 

For the morphological evaluation, cells exposed to nanoHA particles (1 ?g mL
-1 

– 100 ?g mL
-1

), were immunostained and analyzed by Confocal Laser Scanning 

Microscopy (CLSM). 

Immunostaining is a staining method, used to detect a specific protein and it is 

based on the antigen-antibody immune reaction. Direct methods using one antibody 

conjugated with a label, or indirect methods using two antibodies with the secondary 

antibody labeled, are used to trigger a specific immune reaction. Labels are used for 

visualization of the antigen-antibody reaction (Ausubel et al., 2003; Ramos-Vara, 

2005). 

Immunofluorescent staining of F-actin cytoskeleton filaments, CD31 and nuclei 

Briefly, cells were seeded in 96-well plates, where two replicates were set up 

for each sample (Fig. 5). At the culture periods tested (2, 7, 8 and 14 days), samples 

were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde (methanol free) for 15 

minutes to preserve the antigens. Then, samples were permeabilized with 0.1% triton 

for 5 minutes, to ensure the penetration of the antibodies into the cells, and incubated 

in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA/PBS) with 100 ?g mL
-1

 RNAse for 60 minutes at room 

temperature, blocking non-specific bindings of the primary antibodies.

Monocultures of MG-63 cells 

F-actin filaments were stained with Alexafluor-conjugated phalloidin, diluted 

1:100 in 1% BSA/PBS for 60 minutes, at room temperature in dark. Nuclei were 

counterstained with 10 ?g mL
-1

propidium iodide diluted in PBS for 10 minutes.  

 

Monocultures of HDMEC and co-cultures 

Cultures were incubated for 45 minutes with primary CD31 (PECAM-1) antibody 

diluted 1:100 in 1% BSA/PBS. Then, samples were labeled with secondary antibody 

anti-mouse Alexafluor diluted 1:1000 in 1% BSA/PBS for 45 minutes. After that period, 

samples were counterstained with 10 ?g mL
-1

propidium iodide for 10 minutes.  

Finally, all samples were washed with PBS and covered with Vectashield and 

stored at 4° C in dark. CSLM images were acquired on Leica TCP SP2 AOBS at days 2, 7 

and 14.

II.4.TEM  

Cells exposed to 10 ?g mL
-1 

nanoHA particles, were processed for TEM, to 

assess the process of particle internalization and kinetics within cell compartments.  

Cells were seeded in 6 well-plates, where two replicates were set up for each 

sample. At the culture time tested (2, 7, 8 and 14 days) samples were washed twice 

with sodium cacodylate buffer (0.2 M) and fixed with glutaraldehyde (2.5%) for 2 hours 

at room temperature. After that period, samples are washed twice with sodium 

cacodylate buffer (0.2M). Adherent cells were enzymatically released (0.05% trypsin, 

0.25% EDTA) and the cell suspensions were centrifuged at 2000 g for 10 min. The 

resulting pellet was fixed with glutaraldehyde (2.5%), post fixed with osmium tetroxide 

(2%), dehydrated in graded ethanol and later embedded in Epon, using routine 

methods. Ultra-thin (100 nm) sections mounted in copper grids (300 Mesh) were 

contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate for TEM analysis (Zeiss EM 10A) at an 

accelerating voltage 60Kv.  

 

II.5. Statistical analysis 

Statistic analysis was performed using the program: Statistical Package for the 

Social Sciences (SPSS) v.19.0. Four replicates of each sample for the MTT quantitative 

assay were performed. The results were expressed as the arithmetic mean ± standard 

deviation. Dunnet multiple comparison statistical test was also performed to variance 

analysis. Analized results with p ? 0.05 were accounted as statistically significant.

Transmission electron microscopy. Specific surface area 

Nanoparticles microstructure and morphological features were analyzed by 

TEM, before (HS) and after (HSster) the sterilization process. HS nanoparticles presented 

a prismatic rod-like shape, which average length and width were 75 nm&amp;lt;l&amp;lt;100 nm 

and w?25 nm, respectively (Fig. 6a). HSster nanoparticles did not undergo any 

significant morphology change (Fig. 6b). The specific surface area of HS nanoparticles 

was 55 m

, and the SSA was not appreciably affected by sterilization (Table 4). The 

Ca/P ratio of the prepared particles (Table 4) showed negligible deviations from the 

stoichiometric value (1.68).

X-ray diffraction analysis 

X-ray diffraction technique was used to analyze phase composition and 

crystallinity of HS nanoparticles, as prepared and after being sterilized. The XRD 

patterns, shown in Figure 7, indicate that nanoparticles can be attributed to hexagonal 

hydroxyapatite (space group P63/m, a=b=9.4320 Å, c=6.8810 Å) in agreement with the 

data referenced by JCPDS nº 09-0432. Moreover, XRD peaks revealed high intensity 

exhibited by HS nanoparticles, indicating high crystallinity. Also, after sterilization, 

nanoHA particles exhibited an increased intensity of XRD peaks.

Zeta potential 

Figure 8 shows the pH dependence of zeta potential (?) for the studied HA 

nanoparticles. The ? values were negative in the examined pH range for HS 

nanoparticles, as prepared. HSster particles displayed positive ? values for the lowest pH 

values (pH&lt;5.4). ? curve of HS nanoparticles is clearly shifted towards more negative 

values as compared to HSster thereby indicating HS nanoparticles surface charge to 

become less negative upon sterilization.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy  

The FTIR spectrum of HS nanoparticles, as prepared and after sterilization, is 

shown on Figure 9. The examined samples exhibit the main vibration bands normally 

attributed to HA namely those detected at 472, 563, 601, 962 cm
-1

 and in the 1030-

1092 cm
-1 

range due to the bending vibration of O-P-O bond (Fleet, 2009). The peaks at 

3570 cm
-1 

and 632 cm
-1 

assigned to the structural hydroxyl anions (Neira et al., 2009). 

Furthermore, other features are identified in the 1250-1700 cm
-1

 spectral region 

where the citrate related bands are expected to be found, some dissimilar bands were 

observed which may be attributed to carboxylated groups coordinated to particle 

surface in a different manner (Wang et al., 2006; Martins et al., 2008; Nara and 

Tanokura, 2008;  Lee et al., 2011).  Analyzing the FTIR spectra, minor differences 

changes were detected between non-sterilized particles and their sterilized 

counterpart. These include the shoulder at 1420 cm
-1

 and the band at 1567 cm
-1

 which 

appeared less intense in HSster and thus may indicate a partial loss of absorbed 

carboxylated groups by HS particles.

III.2. In vitro biological studies of MG-63 cells 

 

Cell viability/proliferation  

Viability/proliferation of MG-63 cells cultured for 14 days in the absence (control) and 

in the presence of nanoHA particles (1 ?g mL
-1 

– 100 ?g mL
-1

), was assessed by the MTT 

assay (Fig. 10). Results indicate that in control conditions cells proliferated throughout 

the 14-day culture period, especially during the first week (Fig. 10). Addition of 

nanoparticles at day 1 (Fig. 10 A) caused a slight inhibition on cell viability/proliferation 

at day 7, particularly at the highest concentration (100 ?g mL
-1

; p ? 0.05). After 14 days 

of culture in the presence of nanoHA particles, cultures exhibited a well defined dose-

dependent profile, meaning that the higher the concentration the higher the 

viability/proliferation (Fig. 10 A). These effects were more significant (p ? 0.05) for the 

concentrations of 10 ?g mL
-1

 and 100 ?g mL
-1

. Addition of nanoparticles at day 7 (Fig. 

10 B) did not cause any significant change on cell viability/proliferation, compared to 

the control. 24 hours after the addition of nanoHA particles, day 8(7), cultures 

presented stable values of cell viability/proliferation. Also, at day 14 cultures 

maintained in the presence of nanoparticles exhibit some negligible differences 

compared to the control culture (Fig. 10 B), not showing the dose-dependent profile as 

cultures presented on Figure 10 A.

control cultures (p ? 0.05; n = 4)]. 

 

Morphological evaluation and pattern of cell growth  

CLSM observations of the control MG-63 cell culture (Figs. 11A, 11B(a) and 11B 

(e)) showed cells with an elongated polygonal shape and filipodia extensions, distinct 

microfilaments and a well defined nucleus. Cells exposed to nanoHA particles (1 ?g mL
-

1 
– 100 ?g mL

-1
), added at day 1 or at day 7, exhibited the similar appearance and the 

same pattern of cell growth (Fig. 11B). At day 7, it was observed a slight dose-

dependent inhibition, reflected by a lower intensity of the F-actin at the cell limits 

(Figs. 11B b-d), followed by an increase at day 14 (Figs. 11B f-h). Additionally, after 14 

days of culture all samples presented the formation of a continuous cell layer, with the 

F-actin cytoskeleton stained intensively at the cell limits (Figs. 11B e-k).

results obtained after evaluation of TEM images of the MG-63 cells cultured with 10 ?g 

ml

 nanoHA during the time periods tested. Cultures performed in the presence of 

nanoHA added at day 1 were evaluated at days 2, 7 and 14, while cultures exposed to 

nanoparticles from day 7 were evaluated at days 8(7) and 14(7).  

MG-63 cells cultured with 10 ?g mL
-1

 nanoHA presented great internalization of 

nanoparticles during the first week of culture, when those were added at day 1 (Table 

5). The uptake of the particles occurred by the emission of pseudopods-like projections 

surrounding the nanoparticles and entrapping them inside intracellular vesicles (Fig. 

12a). Moreover images show that the nanoparticles are organized in aggregates inside 

vesicles (Figs. 12a, b and d); isolated nanoparticles were not detected either in the 

cytosol, cell nucleus or in other organelles. When nanoHA was added at day 7, cells 

presented less loaded vesicles at days 8(7) and 14(7), compared to that seen with the 

addition of nanoparticles at day 1 (Table 5). 

 Additionally, after 14 days of culture, it was noticed several cells exhibiting 

signs of apoptosis, such as cellular rounded shape, condensed chromatin at nuclear 

periphery and cytoplasmatic vacuolization (Fig. 12c). The number of apoptotic cells 

decreased with the culture time, while number of necrotic cells increased (Table 5).

III.3. In vitro biological studies of HDMEC 

 

Cell viability/proliferation  

To evaluate HDMEC viability/proliferation, in the absence (control) and in the 

presence of nanoHA particles (1 ?g mL
-1 

– 100 ?g mL
-1

), cultures performed for 14 days 

were submitted to the MTT assay (Fig. 13). Control cultures proliferation increased 

during the culture period tested, a significant increase occurred specially at the first 

week. Addition of nanoHA particles at day 1 caused concentration-dependent 

deleterious effects on cell growth on day 7, with statistically significant differences (p ? 

0.05) between the higher concentrations (10 ?g mL
-1 

and 100 ?g mL
-1

) and control (Fig. 

13A). Culture proliferation continued until day 14, whereas the same concentration-

dependent decreased profile was exhibited (Fig. 13A). Additionally, cultures 

maintained for 14 days with the addition of nanoparticles at day 7 (Fig. 13B) also 

exhibited a concentration-dependent decrease on cell viability/proliferation. Results 

showed that at day 8, the decrease was statistically significant for the higher 

concentration (100 ?g mL
-1

; p ? 0.05), while at day 14 the decreased effect was 

statistically significant for the concentrations of 10 ?g mL
-1 

and 100 ?g mL
-1

 (p ? 0.05).

addition of nanoHA at day 7; culture evaluation at days 2, 8 and 14. [*, significantly different from 

control cultures (p ? 0.05; n = 4)]. 

 

Morphological evaluation and pattern of cell growth  

CLSM images of HDMEC cell culture (Fig. 14) showed cell morphology and 

pattern of cell growth during 14 days of culture in the presence of nanoHA particles (1 

?g mL
-1 

– 100 ?g mL
-1

). The immunofluorescent staining revealed the characteristic 

polygonal and elongated shape of HDMEC, a well defined nucleus, cell to cell contacts 

and the formation of a continuous cell layer by days 7 and 14, in the absence of 

nanoparticles (Figs. 14 a and e). Moreover, CLSM images showed that the addition of 

nanoparticles at day 1 caused a time and dose-dependent decrease in the cell growth, 

reflected by the lower intensity of the CD31 at the cell limits and also by the presence 

of voids on the cell culture plates (Figs. 14 b-d; f-h). Cultures exposed to 100 ?g mL
-1

 

nanoHA particles exhibited a marked cell number decrease after 14 days of culture 

(Fig. 14 h). Furthermore, a dose-dependent decrease in the cell growth was also 

observed when nanoparticles were added to the cultures at day 7, whereas samples 

exhibited a decreasing pattern regarding the number of cells and the intensity of the 

immunofluorescent staining of the cell limits (Figs. 14 i-k). 

 

Particle internalization and kinetics 

Ultrastructural images obtained by TEM (Fig. 15), reveal nanoparticles 

internalization and kinetics performed by HDMEC in the concentration of 10 ?g mL
-1

. 

Table 6 summarizes the results obtained after evaluation of TEM images. Cultures 

were evaluated at days 2, 7 and 14, when nanoHA were added at day 1, and at days 

8(7) and 14(7), when nanoparticles were added at day 7.  

Cells cultured in the presence of nanoHA, added at day 1, displayed a high 

internalization of nanoparticles, which were stored in huge loaded vesicles (Fig. 15 and 

Table 6) during the first days of culture. After day 7 nanoHA uptake and the number of 



 RESULTS 

48 
 

loaded vesicles started to decrease with the culture time (Table 6). Comparatively, 

nanoparticles added at day 7 were less internalized by HDMEC (Table 6). During the 14 

days of culture there was a gradual increase of necrotic cells (Table 6).

The process of internalization of nanoHA occurs with the emission of 

pseudopods-like projections towards the particles (Fig. 15 a), surrounding and 

entrapping them inside endossomes (Figs. 15 b, c and d). TEM images also show that 

nanoparticles are organized in clusters inside intracellular vesicles (Figs. 15 b, c and d); 

isolated particles are not detected either in the cytosol, cell nucleus or in other 

organelles.

III.4. In vitro biological studies of MG-63 cells and HDMEC co-culture 

Cell viability/proliferation  

Data from the MTT assay (Fig. 16) showed the viability/proliferation of MG-63 

cells and HDMEC co-culture, maintained for 14 days, in the absence (control) and in 

the presence of nanoHA particles (1 ?g mL
-1 

– 100 ?g mL
-1

).  Control cultures presented 

an increase on cell viability/proliferation during 14 days of culture, especially at the 

first week (Fig. 16). The addition of nanoHA particles at day 1 (Fig. 16A) caused a slight 

inhibition on cell viability/proliferation at day 7, with significant statistically differences 

between the concentrations of 10 and 100 ?g mL
-1

 and the control (p ? 0.05). 

Meanwhile, at day 14, cultures presented a statistically significant increase in 

viability/proliferation, compared to the control cultures (1 ?g mL
-1 

– 100 ?g mL
-1

; p ? 

0.05). Fig. 16B shows the MTT values of the cultures performed in presence of nanoHA 

added at day 7. No significant changes were observed with the addition of 

nanoparticles, regarding the viability/proliferation. Compared to the cultures with 

addition at day 1, nanoparticles did not exert a stimulatory effect when added at day 7.

mixed up pattern (Fig. 17 e). The addition of nanoparticles at day 1, at lower 

concentrations (1 and 10 ?g mL

pattern of cell growth after 7 days, compared to the control. Meanwhile, at the highest 

concentration of nanoHA particles (100 ?g mL

endothelial cells was observed, being that the osteoblastic cells occupied most of the 

cell culture plate (Fig. 17 d). At day 14, cultures exposed to 1 and 10 ?g mL

), at 

day 7, did not cause any significant changes on the pattern of cell growth, as all the

nanoHA, exhibited lower nanoparticles uptake (Table 7), compared with the respective 

monocultures, either for the addition of nanoHA at day 1 or at day 7. The process of 

particle uptake was initiated by the emission of pseudopods-like projections 

surrounding the nanoparticles (Fig. 18 a). Images show nanoparticles organized in 

aggregates, inside intracellular vesicles (Figs. 18 a, b and d); isolated particles were not 

detected either in the cytosol, cell nucleus or in other organelles. Additionally, Fig. 18 c 

reveals cellular debris in the extracellular space, which probably results from the 

progressive degeneration of apoptotic bodies. During 14 days of culture, there was 

also an increase of the necrotic cells, as presented on Table 7. 

Furthermore, Figure 19 reveals the differences in the amount of particles 

internalized by monocultured and co-cultured MG-63 cells and HDMEC, 24 hours after 

the addition of nanoHA particles at day 1. It is noted that the amount of particles 

internalized was greater for the monocultures (Figs. 19 b and c), which presented more 

loaded vesicles than the co-culture system (Fig. 19 a). Also, comparing the images 

corresponding to two types of monoculture at day 2, it is clear that HDMEC uptake of 

nanoparticles is superior than the uptake by MG-63 cells, taking into account the size 

of the vesicles loaded with nanoHA particles (Figs. 19 b and c).

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 

57 
 

IV.1. Discussion 

Attempting to improve bone repair using engineered orthopedic/dental 

implants, many research have focused on the synthesis of new biomaterials and their 

in vitro biological compatibility, before implantation. Supported by the advances in the 

nanotechnology field, several nanostructured HA materials have been developed to 

simulate the inorganic phase of bone. This might be one way to ensure the 

biomaterial’s biological success. Thus, several works report that nanostructured HA 

films, granules and composite scaffolds exhibit superior osteoblastic activity than their 

conventional (or micron sized) counterparts (Guo et al., 2007; Shi et al., 2009; 

Laranjeira et al., 2010). However, information about the biological effect of isolated 

nanoparticles, accidentally released of these nanostructured materials to the 

surrounding tissues, during or after implantation, is scarce but, of at utmost 

importance (Revell, 2006; Zhang and Webster, 2009). Also, regarding the fact that 

angiogenesis occurs during bone development and repair, playing an active and 

important role in osteogenesis (Carano and Filvarof, 2003), endothelial cells have been 

used as biological models to study the potential success of the biomaterials used in 

BTE, namely in studies regarding the issue of scaffolds vascularization (Kirkpatrick et 

al., 2003; Kanczler and Oreffo, 2008). Therefore, information about the effects of 

nanoHA isolated particles on osteoblastic and endothelial cells, as well as on their 

relationship is most relevant regarding the potential applications of nanoHA in bone 

tissue.  

The aim of this thesis was to characterize the biological profile of nanoHA 

particles, synthesized by a hydrothermal method, on isolated and co-cultured 

osteoblastic and endothelial cells. In order to address this issue the synthesized 

nanoparticles were firstly submitted to a structural and chemical evaluation. Then, the 

nanoHA effect both on the viability/proliferation and pattern of cell growth, was 

assessed by the MTT colorimetric assay and by evaluation of CLSM images. Also, the 

mechanism of nanoparticle internalization and kinetics within cellular compartments 

was evaluated by TEM images, of isolated and co-cultured osteoblastic and endothelial 

cells exposed to different concentrations of nanoHA during 14 days. 



DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 

58 
 

HS particles exhibited similar physicochemical profile, as prepared and after 

sterilization. HS and HSster presented a crystalline and well defined prismatic shape, 

such features are in line with results obtained when HA is synthesized at high 

temperatures (T&gt;100° C) (Wang et al., 2006a; Wang et al., 2006b; Wang et al., 2007; 

Zhu et al., 2011). Regarding the steam sterilization behavior, some crystallite size 

variations are also remarked but with a small extent, as documented in Table 4. Since 

particle size, shape and surface area are maintained practically unchanged during 

autoclaving it is concluded that dissolution and re-precipitation processes, if any, were 

negligible. The slight morphology variations suffered by HS particles during sterilization 

were accompanied by different trends in the surface charge variation: whereas HSster 

particles tended to a less negative surface charge in the pH range tested. As evidenced 

by FTIR results, the sterilization process induced some changes on the configuration of 

the carboxylated groups absorbed on the particle surfaces. The citrate contribution to 

the particle surface charge will be ruled by the amount of free carboxylated groups 

negatively charged which in turn is conditioned by the citrate coordination mode to HA 

surface. Moreover, it was already reported that citric acid may degrade at T&gt;145° C 

(Bednarz et al., 2011; Wyrzykowski et al., 2011) leading to reaction products that 

include different dehydroxylated or decarboxylated acids and anhydrides depending 

on the used heating rate and temperature. It is thus hypothesized that the original 

citrate ions do not exist as adsorbed species on HS particle surface but instead smaller 

carboxylated ions resulting from citrate ion decomposition under the high 

temperature and pressure used for HA hydrothermal synthesis. As previously referred, 

the intensity of some carboxylate related bands in FTIR spectrum tended to decrease 

upon sterilization being thus concluded that a partial desorption of absorbed 

carboxylated species might have occurred thereby explaining the small increase of 

HSster zeta potential.  

As observed, sterilization did not cause any relevant modification either on the 

morphology, specific surface area, crystallinity or chemical structure of the tested 

particles; therefore we chose to work with sterilized nanoparticles to assess their 

biological effect on isolated and co-cultured osteoblastic and endothelial cells. 



DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 

59 
 

Osteoblastic cell response to the added nanoparticles, evaluated in MG-63 cell 

cultures, showed that the tested concentrations of nanoHA particles did not cause 

deleterious effects on cell viability/proliferation, during the time period tested. While 

the addition of nanoparticles at day 1 caused a slight inhibition at day 7, after 14 days 

cultures exhibited a concentration-dependent increased. Also, cell 

viability/proliferation was not affected by the addition of nanoparticles at day 7, since 

results are similar to that of the control cultures. In agreement to these results, the 

addition of nanoHA particles did not cause any changes either on the overall cell 

morphology or on the pattern of cell growth. The existing literature regarding the use 

of nanoHA do not report its concentration-dependent effect on osteoblastic cell 

cultures, as isolated particles. Even though, the nanoHA non-toxic and osteoconductive 

properties observed in our work are in line with previous in vitro studies with MG-63 

osteoblast-like cells (Mateus et al., 2007; Shi et al., 2009; Laranjeira et al., 2010), MSC 

(Cai et al., 2007) and human osteoblasts (Guo et al., 2007), reporting the great 

functional properties of nanoHA materials, namely the ability to promote cell 

proliferation, adhesion and spread without causing any morphological changes. TEM 

data showed that the uptake of nanoHA particles occurred via endocytosis, as 

expected for the internalization of nanoparticles (Iversen et al., 2011). Images 

suggested great variability in nanoHA uptake during the culture time and also 

regarding the different moments of nanoparticles addition. Thus, results indicated that 

particle internalization occurred preferentially with the addition at day 1 and during 

the first week of culture, whereas cells presented loaded vesicles; while less 

nanoparticles uptake occurred with the addition at day 7. These differences may be 

related to the particle-cell interactions at different moments of the culture. Several 

works reported the uptake of isolated nanoHA particles in periodontal ligament cells 

(Sun et al., 2007), liver cancer cells (Bauer et al., 2008) and macrophages (Motskin et 

al, 2009) or in U2OS cells and MSC (Cai et al., 2007) and MG-63 cells (Shi et al., 2009) 

growing over nanoHA films. Regarding these studies, variability on the uptake of 

nanoHA was noted, this might be related to differences on the nanoparticles 

physicochemical characteristics such as, shape, charge, size and surface area (Shi et al., 

2009; Motskin et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2011), cell type (Cai et al., 2007) and cell 



DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

density (Iversen et al., 2011). The differences observed in nanoHA uptake occurred in 

our work might, therefore, explain the results of the viability/proliferation assay. The 

addition of nanoparticles at day 1 caused a rapid internalization by the cells promoting 

a stimulatory effect on the culture; while the less internalization observed when 

nanoHA was added at day 7 might explain why cultures exhibited the same 

viability/proliferation values as the control cultures. 

Moreover, the present results also provide information about the biological 

effect of nanoHA isolated particles on monocultured endothelial cells. Therefore, 

control monocultures of HDMEC, maintained for 14 days in the absence of 

nanoparticles, exhibited an increased viability/proliferation, which was in agreement 

with the CLSM observations. However, with the addition of nanoparticles, cell 

metabolic activity decreased, revealing a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect of 

nanoparticles during that culture time. The immunofluorescent staining of CD31 was 

performed to assess the expression of endothelial phenotype and cell function, since 

this transmembrane glycoprotein presented on the surface of endothelial cells 

(Michiels, 2003) is also a sensitive marker of the endothelial cell function (Kirkpatrick 

et al., 2007). CLSM images showed a time and concentration-dependent decrease on 

the intensity of the CD31 staining, meaning the loss of cell functions when exposed to 

nanoparticles in addition to the decreased cell number. Previous studies, using isolated 

nanoHA particles on endothelial cell cultures, reported the pro-angiogenic properties 

of this biomaterial (Pezzatini et al., 2006; Pezzatini et al., 2007). However, these 

positive effects were only reported for lower concentrations (under 10 ?g mL
-1

) of 

nanoHA particles, while at higher concentrations, cell viability was reduced and cell 

morphological changes occurred, indicating the possible deleterious effects of these 

nanoparticles. Additionally, TEM results indicated that the internalization of 

nanoparticles by HDMEC was rapid and occurred at the first moments of the culture, 

and also indicated that particles internalization occurred preferentially when those 

were added at the beginning of the culture. Therefore, when nanoparticles were 

added at day 1, the uptake was rapid and at day 2 cells presented a great amount of 

loaded vesicles which started to decrease until reaching the end of the culture time. 

These data indicate possible particle dissolution within the lysossomes, taking into 



DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

account its acidic environment, which is in line with studies in osteoblasts (Xu et al., 

2009) and macrophages (Motskin et al., 2009). The nanoparticles deleterious effects 

on HDMEC cultures during the culture time might be due to the particle dissolution 

within lysossomes and the consequent release of calcium and phosphate ions to the 

cytoplasm at toxic concentrations. Alterations on the level of calcium in the cytosol or 

within lysossomes, have a high impact in the regulation of several vital cellular 

functions (Clapham, 2007). These facts might explain the decreased viability presented 

by HDMEC monocultures in the presence of nanoHA particles, but further information 

about the intracellular trafficking and signaling pathways is needed.   

Interaction between osteoblasts and endothelial cells has been the focus of 

interest of several studies, regarding the use of these cell types co-cultured with 

different biomaterials such as, polycaprolacton-starch scaffolds (Santos et al., 2009b; 

Fuchs et al, 2009a), polyurethane scaffolds (Hofmann et al, 2008), silk fibroin 

constructs (Fuchs et al., 2009b), 3-D porous biomaterials (Unger et al., 2007), among 

others. However, despite all of that information, the exact biological effect of nanoHA 

isolated particles on these co-cultured cells, still neglected.  

Results, concerning control co-cultures, indicate an increased metabolic activity 

throughout 14 days of culture, which is in agreement with CLSM observations. Similar 

results were observed by Zhang et al. in 2010, at earlier stages of the culture, 

endothelial cells and osteoblasts co-cultured in direct contact, promoted the 

osteoblastic proliferation (Zhang et al., 2010). The observed stimulatory effect is 

related with the narrow relationship between endothelial and osteoblastic cells, 

mediated by paracrine communication, using soluble factors (Villars et al., 2000; 

Clarkin et al., 2008) and by direct communication through cell to cell contacts or gap 

junctions (Villars et al., 2002; Grellier et al., 2009). The presence of nanoparticles, 

added at day 1, at smaller concentrations (1 and 10 ?g mL
-1

), did not interfere 

significantly with the communication between the two cell populations, as the pattern 

of cell growth are similar to the control cultures. However, cultures exposed to higher 

concentration of nanoparticles (100 ?g mL
-1

) induced a different pattern, and 

osteoblasts occupied the majority of the culture plate while the number of endothelial 

cells decreased drastically. Thus, the MTT values registered for the higher

concentration of nanoparticles, concerns the majority of the osteoblastic metabolic 

activity. Moreover, the addition of nanoHA particles at day 7 did not cause any 

differences either in the number of cells or in the cell proliferation/viability, compared 

to the control cultures. In terms of TEM results, cultures exposed to nanoHA particles 

presented lower particle internalization, when compared with the respective 

monocultures, either for the addition at day 1 or at day 7. Thus, it is likely that the 

communication between the two cell populations affects their behavior with regard to 

the nanoparticles uptake. Also, the presented results for the cellular metabolic activity 

seems to depend more on the relationship of these two cell types, than on the 

presence of the nanoHA particles. 

 

IV.2. Conclusions  

HS nanoHA particles, before and after sterilization, were characterized by their 

morphological features, i.e. size and shape, and also by their surface chemical 

condition reflected in both zeta potential curves and FTIR spectra. After particle 

characterization, negligible differences were registered between sterilized and non-

sterilized particles, evidencing HS nanoparticles chemical stability.  

NanoHA particles were readily internalized by MG-63 cells and HDMEC, but 

HDMEC presented a higher percentage of intercellular vesicles loaded with 

nanoparticles. These differences may be related to the differences of effect on these 

two cell types. While nanoHA particles had a stimulatory effect on the MG-63 cells, a 

deleterious effect was observed for the HDMEC cultures. Also, the effect was more 

significant when the nanoparticles were added at the beginning of the culture. Co-

cultured MG-63 cells and HDMEC revealed less internalization of nanoparticles than 

the respective monocultures, evidencing the importance of cellular communication for 

the culture response to the presence of nanoHA particles. Due to the low toxicity and 

osteoconductive effect on the osteoblastic culture, nanoHA particles exhibit an 

interesting profile for biomedical applications. However, further research must be 

made to overcome the observed deleterious effects on endothelial cells.
