RESUMO 

Moura, T.T. Estruturas transversais às bacias de Taubaté e Resende: natureza e 

possível continuidade na Bacia de Santos. 2015. 23 f. Dissertação (Mestrado) - Instituto de 

Geociências, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo. 

As bacias de Taubaté e Resende são bacias continentais paleógenas do tipo rift, 

orientadas segundo a direção NE a ENE e fazem parte do segmento central do Rift Continental 

do Sudeste do Brasil. Ambas foram instaladas durante o Eoceno, resultantes de um campo de 

esforços distensivo de direção NW-SE. Este campo reativou zonas de cisalhamento de direção 

NE do embasamento pré-cambriano como falhas normais, importantes durante a instalação e 

evolução da bacia. Há também inúmeras estruturas transversais ao eixo da bacia, de direções 

N-S, NE-SW e NW-SE, as quais compreendem falhas e dobras que estiveram ativas durante 

diferentes intervalos de tempo, embora seus papeis na evolução da bacia ainda sejam pouco 

conhecidos. A fim de reconhecer estas estruturas em subsuperfície na Bacia de Taubaté, cinco 

perfis sísmicos longitudinais ao eixo da bacia foram interpretados, demonstrando o caráter 

distinto dessas estruturas como falhas normais e inversas, que interceptam diferentes unidades 

sísmicas, indicando uma deformação tectônica polifásica. A presença de altos estruturais 

transversais, distinguíveis em perfis sísmicos, ativos durante a abertura da bacia, pode estar 

relacionada com anticlinais formados na capa das falhas, durante uma evolução relacionada ao 

crescimento das falhas principais de borda em um regime distensivo de direção NW-SE. Ainda, 

foram descritas em afloramentos falhas sinsedimentares de componente normal, de direção 

NW-SE e transversais à Bacia de Resende, dispostas em um alto ângulo com relação à 

orientação ENE das falhas principais de borda. Estas estruturas foram interpretadas como falhas 

de alívio formadas no mesmo contexto distensivo. As relações estratigráficas e a análise de 

paleotensões das populações de falhas indicaram que as estruturas transversais estão 

relacionadas a quatro eventos deformacionais: compressão NE-SW, provavelmente durante o 

Mioceno; compressão NW-SE, durante o Pleistoceno Superior; distensão E-W a NW-SE 

durante o Holoceno; e por fim compressão E-W relacionada ao campo de esforços atual. A 

evolução da Bacia de Santos na porção adjacente offshore durante o Cenozoico pode estar 

diretamente relacionada à presença de estruturas transversais, mudanças de campo de estresse 

e a geração e eventos deformacionais nas bacias continentais do tipo rift.

ABSTRACT 

Moura, T.T. Transverse structures in Taubaté and Santos basins: nature and possible 

continuity in Santos Basin, Brazil. 2015. 23 f. MSc Dissertation. Instituto de Geociências, 

Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo. 

The Taubaté and Resende are NE-to-ENE-oriented Paleogene continental rift basins of 

the central segment of the Continental Rift of Southeastern Brazil. Both basins were installed 

during the Eocene as a result of a NW-SE-oriented extensional stress field. This stress field 

reactivated NE-trending shear zones of the Precambrian basement as normal faults, which 

played a major role during the basin installation and evolution. There are also numerous N-S, 

NE-SW and NW-SE-oriented structures transverse to the NE-trending basin axis. These 

structures comprise faults and folds that were active at different time intervals, but their role in 

the basin evolution is poorly understood yet. In order to recognize these structures in the 

subsurface in Taubaté Basin, five longitudinal seismic profiles were interpreted showing their 

distinctive character as normal and reverse faults, which intersect different seismic units and 

indicate a polyphasic tectonic deformation. The presence of transverse structural highs, 

recognizable in the seismic profiles, which were active during the opening of the basin, can be 

related to anticlines formed in the hangingwall during an evolution related to the growing of 

the border master faults in a NW-SE-trending extensional regime. Moreover, syn-sedimentary 

NW-SE-oriented transverse normal faults oblique to the ENE-orientation of the border master 

faults were described in outcrops in the Resende Basin. These structures are interpreted as 

release faults and thus formed in the same extensional context. Stratigraphic relationships and 

paleostress analysis of fault populations indicate that transverse structures are related to four 

deformational events: a NE-SW-oriented compression probably during the Miocene, a NW-SE-

oriented compression in the Late Pleistocene to Holocene, an E-W-to-NW-SE-oriented 

extension in the Holocene and lastly, an E-W-oriented compression related to the present-day 

stress field. The evolution of the adjoining offshore Santos Basin during the Cenozoic has a 

narrow correlation with the formation and evolution of Taubaté and Resende basins. The 

migration of depocenters in the Santos Basin during the Cenozoic can be associated with the 

presence of NW-SE-oriented transverse structures, changes in the stress fields, and generation 

and deformation events in the continental rift basins 

Keywords: Tectonics of sedimentary basins, paleostress analysis, Cenozoic,

1. INTRODUÇÃO 

O Rift Continental do Sudeste do Brasil (RCSB) é uma depressão alongada, paralela à 

costa atual do sudeste do Brasil. Possui cerca de 900 km de comprimento, percorrendo três 

estados: Paraná, São Paulo e Rio de Janeiro (Riccomini, 1989). A evolução do RCSB se iniciou 

no Paleógeno sobre as rochas de médio a baixo grau metamórfico de idades paleo- a 

neoproterozoicas do Cinturão Ribeira (definido por Hasui et al. 1975), além de granitoides do 

Neoproterozoico (v.g. Alves et al. 2013). 

No Cinturão Ribeira, a anisotropia das rochas e as zonas de fraqueza resultam do 

metamorfismo que ocorreu durante a Orogenia Brasiliana. Ao final do evento Brasiliano o setor 

central deste cinturão foi afetado por inúmeras falhas de componente transcorrente (Souza et 

al., 2009). De acordo com Campanha (2002), a evolução pós-Brasiliano está relacionada com 

os estágios de transição e reativação da Plataforma Brasileira, passando por um evento 

mesozoico em que expressivos movimentos verticais precederam um magmatismo básico e 

alcalino, até o desenvolvimento do Rift Continental do Sudeste do Brasil durante o Cenozoico.  

De acordo com Riccomini et al. (2004) o RCSB pode ser dividido em três segmentos: 

ocidental, central e oriental. As bacias de Taubaté e Resende são depressões tectônicas 

localizadas entre a Serra do Mar e a Serra da Mantiqueira (Figura 1) e estão inseridas no 

segmento central do RCSB, assim como as bacias de São Paulo e Volta Redonda.  

 

Figura 1 - Localização da área de estudo (adaptado de Marques, 1990 e Almeida, 1976) 



11 
 

A principal fase de desenvolvimento do RCSB ocorreu durante o Eoceno-Oligoceno, 

com a deposição sintectônica do Grupo Taubaté, sedimentos depositados sintectonicamente 

(Riccomini et al., 2004). 

A Bacia de Taubaté é a maior bacia desse sistema rift, possuindo 170 km de 

comprimento e 20 km de largura, com profundidade de até 850 m, sendo reconhecidos seis 

depocentros (denominados por Marques, 1990, como Parateí, Jacareí, Eugênio de Melo, 

Quiririm, Roseira e Lorena, de SW para NE) que são separados por altos estruturais associados 

a falhas normais de direção NW-SE, informação essa corroborada por dados sísmicos 

(Marques, 1990) e dados gravimétricos (Fernandes &amp;amp; Chang, 2002). Dois altos estruturais na 

Bacia de Taubaté foram identificados por Fernandes &amp;amp; Chang (2002) que os denominaram de 

Alto de Caçapava e Alto de Pindamonhangaba. A Bacia de Resende, por sua vez, apresenta 

comprimento aproximado de 50 km e largura máxima de 8 km. 

Riccomini (1989) reconheceu dois sistemas de falhas transversais no RCSB, os sistemas 

NNW e NNE. O sistema NNE apresenta predominantemente falhas transcorrentes dextrais 

associadas a estruturas em flor negativas e positivas, assim como falhas normais e inversas. 

Este sistema controla altos estruturais que localmente expõem o embasamento pré-cambriano, 

além de baixos. Já o sistema NNW compreende principalmente falhas normais e transcorrentes 

sinistrais. Este sistema parece controlar o Alto Estrutural de Arujá, que expõe rochas do 

embasamento pré-cambriano e separa as bacias de São Paulo e Taubaté. 

Além disso, dobramentos em escala regional foram reconhecidos mediante contorno 

estrutural efetuado a partir de dados de furos de sondagem em uma área delimitada pelas 

cidades de Taubaté, São José dos Campos e Pindamonhangaba (Riccomini, 1989). Takyia et al. 

(1990) investigou estas estruturas na Formação Tremembé usando krigagem geoestatística. Os 

resultados indicaram a presença de dobras cônicas com eixos de direção NNW que são 

correlacionáveis às dobras mesoscópicas identificadas em afloramentos da Formação 

Tremembé (Riccomini, 1989). Estas dobras são o resultado de uma compressão NE-SW 

ocorrida durante o Mioceno. Durante o Pleistoceno, as falhas de borda do rift foram reativadas, 

sob uma compressão NW-SE, que produziu novas dobras nos folhelhos da Formação 

Tremembé, criando assim um padrão de interferência do tipo domo e bacia (Riccomini 1989, 

Silva 2007). 

Estruturas transversais de direção NW-SE também foram identificadas na Bacia de 

Santos por Souza et al. (2009). Tais estruturas atuaram durante a evolução da Bacia de Santos 



12 
 

e segundo o autor eram persistentes continente adentro, interceptando as bacias de Taubaté e 

Resende.  

A Bacia de Santos compreende uma área de 352.000 km2, localizada defronte aos 

estados de Santa Catarina, Paraná, São Paulo e Rio de Janeiro, sendo formada por processos de 

rifteamento durante a separação Afro-Americana no Mesozoico (Chang et al., 2008). O 

Cinturão Ribeira é também o embasamento principal da área mais rasa da Bacia de Santos, cujo 

preenchimento sedimentar é típico de um contexto de margens divergentes, formados por 

sequências continentais, transicionais e marinhas, com espessuras de até 13.000 m (Chang &amp;amp; 

Kowsmann, 1984).

2. OBJETIVOS 

O objetivo deste trabalho é analisar as estruturas transversais às bacias de Taubaté e 

Resende, com enfoque em sua natureza, geometria, cinemática, relação com a sedimentação, 

idade, campos de esforços ativos durante a sua geração e deformação e correlação regional. 

O controle exercido por falhas de alívio e falhas de transferência sobre a distribuição de 

campos de óleo e gás foi sugerido em estudos recentes (e.g. Destro et al. 2003). A identificação 

desses tipos de falhas na Bacia de Santos requer investigações sísmicas enquanto que estudos 

na porção onshore contígua (bacias do RCSB) é altamente facilitada pela possibilidade de 

observação direta. 

Considerando este cenário, a evolução tectônica das bacias de Taubaté e Resende é 

relevante para compreender a evolução tectônica da Bacia de Santos durante o Cenozoico. A 

identificação de estruturas transversais na porção onshore certamente será importante no estudo 

da estruturação tectônica da Bacia de Santos, com implicações para a exploração de óleo e gás. 

Portanto, é discutida a possibilidade de uma continuidade física dessas estruturas e/ou 

ação dos campos de esforços a elas relacionados na Bacia de Santos.

3. MATERIAIS E MÉTODOS 

3.1. Dados de campo 

Considerando as controvérsias relacionadas à formação das estruturas transversais nas 

Bacias de Santos e Resende, o primeiro passo compreendeu o reconhecimento dessas estruturas 

na bibliografia e material cartográfico. 

Assim, foram selecionados afloramentos que eram mais favoráveis à coleta de dados 

estruturais. Alguns dos afloramentos possuem um complexo cenário estrutural, sendo, portanto, 

importante identificar as relações de corte entre as falhas, assim como a relação destas com os 

depósitos sedimentares, a fim de se obter uma idade relativa dessas estruturas. 

Com o objetivo de determinar a cronologia dos eventos de falhamentos foi utilizado o 

método descrito por Angelier (1994), que considera a idade das rochas afetadas ou não por 

falhas (Figura 2), a relação geométrica entre o deslocamento das falhas e a consistência mecânica. 

Também foi utilizada a relação de corte entre estrias de movimento identificadas em superfícies 

de falhas, pois algumas falhas se moveram ou foram reativadas sob mais de um evento 

deformacional. No entanto, esta relação de corte, com as estrias mais jovens interceptando as 

mais novas, nem sempre é clara, pois eventos mais antigos muitas vezes são mascarados ou 

mesmo apagados por eventos mais recentes, dificultando a reconstrução dos movimentos. 

 

Figura 2 - Datação estratigráfica de falhas. As camadas superiores nas seções não são afetadas por falhas (Angelier 1994) 

 

Além da coleta dos dados estruturais em campo, alguns afloramentos foram 

selecionados (especialmente pela sua importância e qualidade de dados) para apresentação 

como panoramas, utilizando-se o programa GIMP 2 aliado ao script Pandora. 



15 
 

3.2. Dados sísmicos e cartográficos 

A fim de compilar todo o material cartográfico, assim como analisar os modelos digitais 

de elevação, utilizou-se o programa Quantum Gis 2.6. Quatro imagens ASTER foram 

selecionadas a partir do ASTER GDEM (The ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model) que é 

um produto desenvolvido e disponibilizado ao público (no site 

gdem.ersdac.jspacesystems.or.jp) pelo METI - Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry - do 

Japão e pela NASA - United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration. As 

imagens são geradas a partir de dados coletados a partir de um instrumento óptico espacial 

chamado ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer). O 

pós-intervalo é de 30 m e a precisão do modelo digital de terreno é entre 7 e 14 m. 

Os mapas geológicos assim como os estruturais foram obtidos através do GEOBANK – 

CPRM (Companhia de Pesquisa de Recursos Minerais – disponível em: geobank.cprm.gov.br) 

enquanto os mapas hidrográficos foram obtidos a partir do IBGE (Instituto Brasileiro de 

Geografia e Estatística – disponível em www.ibge.gov.br). 

Cogné et al. (2013) apresentou uma série de perfis sísmicos 2D, de alta resolução, 

disponibilizados pela Petrobras e adquiridos na década de 1980, para a região da Bacia de 

Taubaté. Assim, foram selecionados os perfis paralelos ao eixo longitudinal da bacia, a fim de 

identificar as estruturas transversais, em subsuperfície, assim como a sua relação com a 

sedimentação das unidades na bacia. Esta relação torna possível a datação relativa dos eventos 

de geração (falhas sinsedimentares) e deformação (falhas pós- sedimentares) na bacia. 

Além disso, os mapas de isópacas da Bacia de Santos, obtidos a partir de Assine et al. 

2008, foram analisados a fim de se comparar a migração dos depocentros na Bacia de Santos 

com os eventos deformacionais observados nas bacias de Taubaté e Resende. 

3.3. Análise dos dados estruturais 

Para determinação das paleotensões se escolheu utilizar o método dos diedros retos, 

proposto por Angelier e Mechler (1977). Trata-se de um método gráfico de determinação de 

paleotensões. Tal método não objetiva a determinação de um tensor médio de esforços, mas 

permite definir regiões de confiança onde se situam os principais eixos de esforços. Assim, para 

cada falha, dois diedros retos estão em compressão e dois em distensão, sendo eles limitados 

pelo plano da falha e pelo plano auxiliar. Assim, a orientação do eixo de esforço máximo ?1 

deve pertencer ao diedro compressivo, enquanto a orientação do eixo de esforço mínimo ?3 



16 
 

pertence ao diedro distensivo. Consequentemente, onde dois ou mais movimentos de falhas 

ocorrerem sob o mesmo regime de esforços, o eixo principal deve pertencer ao mesmo diedro 

para todos os mecanismos de falhas, de modo que áreas residuais indicam um intervalo de 

possibilidades para os eixos principais de esforços (Angelier, 1994). A Figura 3 resume as 

principais características do método dos diedros retos e do mecanismo de falhas.

hemisfério inferior. F: plano de falha; A: plano auxiliar; n: normal ao plano de falha; s: vetor de movimento; B: intersecção 

dos planos A e F; P: diedro compressivo; T: diedro distensivo (adaptado de Angelier 1994) 

 

Este método foi aplicado com o uso do programa T-Tecto 3.0 (Žalohar &amp;amp; Vrabec, 2007), 

que permite utilizar análise micropolar e clássica de sistemas de falhas homogêneos e 

heterogêneos a partir de diferentes métodos numéricos, incluindo o de Gauss para a 

determinação dos tensores, separando sistemas de falhas heterogêneos em subsistemas 

homogêneos. A análise considera que a direção do rejeito em um conjunto de falhas 

diferentemente orientadas pode ser explicada por um único tensor.  

O método Gauss para separação de sistemas de falhas heterogêneos em subsistemas de 

falhas homogêneos, descrito em Žalohar &amp;amp; Vrabec (2007), é baseado na filosofia tradicional de 

inversão de dados de rejeito em falhas (fault-slip data inversion), que envolve o conceito de 

tensor mais adequado (best-fit stress tensor). Primeiro, a “função de compatibilidade” é definida 

como uma função gaussiana, que depende da “medida de compatibilidade”, levando em 

consideração: (1) a diferença angular entre a tensão cisalhante determinada e a direção atual de 

movimento no plano da falha e (2) a razão entre a tensão normal e cisalhante no plano da falha, 

desde que assumido que os resultados da inversão de tensão estejam em concordância com a 

Lei de Amonton. 



17 
 

Adicionalmente, foi utilizada a visualização mediante o emprego do método multiple-

slip que compreende a soma dos campos compressivos e distensivos de todas as falhas, o que 

conduz a campos P e T comuns. 

Os dados coletados em campo foram digitados em planilhas do tipo xls e foram 

adequados para a entrada no banco de dados do T-Tecto 3.0, empregando-se o programa 

Tectonics FP 1.6.2. Trata-se de uma planilha do tipo xls, na qual os dados de entrada são aqueles 

coletados em campo (atitudes do plano de falha, estrias e sentido do movimento).  

Com o emprego do T-Tecto 3.0 também foi possível traçar os estereogramas estruturais 

utilizando-se a rede de Wulf (projeção de igual ângulo), hemisfério inferior.

6. CONCLUSÕES 

O enfoque principal deste trabalho foi o estudo das estruturas transversais às bacias de 

Taubaté e Resende, principalmente sua natureza, geometria, cinemática, relações com a 

sedimentação, idade, o campo de esforços ativo durante sua geração e deformação e correlações 

regionais. Além disso, a possibilidade de uma continuidade física dessas estruturas e/ou a ação 

de campos de esforços relacionados a elas na Bacia de Santos foram também discutidos. As 

principais conclusões deste trabalho são: 

a) falhas transversas em perfis sísmicos apresentam altos mergulhos e possuem caráter normal, 

inverso e transcorrente; todas as unidades sísmicas são interceptadas por falhas, incluindo 

pacotes sedimentares mais jovens, porém todas as falhas foram identificadas como pré- e pós-

sedimentares; 

b) altos estruturais foram identificados em perfis sísmicos e alguns deles estiveram ativos 

durante a instalação da Bacia de Taubaté; 

c) a existência de um alto estrutural ativo e a presença de uma unidade sísmica exclusiva em 

uma sub-bacia estaria relacionada ao crescimento de uma falha de borda, em um regime 

distensivo; 

d) o método de inversão e a análise de paleotensões permitiu identificar estruturas transversais 

relacionadas a cinco eventos tectônicos previamente reconhecidos no segmento central do 

RCSB; 

e) estruturas transversais relacionadas ao evento inicial de distensão NW-SE (Eoceno - 

Oligoceno) são representadas por falhas normais sinsedimentares, relacionadas às falhas 

principais e, aparentemente, não interceptam ou conectam falhas normais diferentes, indicando 

um campo distensivo de direção NE-SW, o que permite classifica-las como falhas de alívio; 

f) falhas transversais associadas ao evento de compressão de direção NE-SW e distensão NW-

SE (Mioceno) são em parte sinsedimentares em relação à Formação Itaquaquecetuba; a 

espessura das camadas dobradas da Formação Tremembé, que é praticamente uniforme, e um 

padrão de dobramento en echelon indicam que essas dobras estão relacionadas com uma 

compressão de direção NE-SW, em regime transcorrente; 

g) falhas transversais relacionadas ao evento de compressão NW-SE e distensão NE-SW 

(Pleistoceno Superior – Holoceno) são principalmente normais, com uma direção geral NW-

SE, afetando linhas de seixos e colúvios; algumas dessas falhas possuem mergulho sub-vertical 

e a superposição de estrias, verificada em alguns afloramentos, indica que tais falhas podem 

representar reativações de antigas falhas transversais de componente transcorrente; 



20 
 

h) o evento de distensão E-W a NW-SE (Holoceno) gerou falhas transversais com uma direção 

geral N-S a NNE-WSW que interceptam a Formação Pindamonhangaba bem como linhas de 

seixos e colúvios arenosos sobrepostos; 

i) poucas falhas transversais foram relacionadas à compressão de direção E-W (atual campo 

de esforços), na área de estudo; a direção variável e a natureza das falhas indicam que foram 

provavelmente formadas em eventos deformacionais pretéritos e reativadas, pois mostram uma 

alta dispersão na posição das estrias relacionadas a este evento, sendo as falhas reativadas 

provavelmente em um plano não ideal; 

j) apenas as estruturas NW-SE exerceram influência sobre a Bacia de Santos durante sua 

evolução cenozoica; cinco lineamentos com esta direção foram reconhecidos nos mapas de 

isópacas, com possível continuidade na área offshore, controlando os depocentros na Bacia de 

Santos: os lineamentos A (continuidade do Alto Estrutural de Arujá) e B (prolongação do Alto 

Estrutural de Queluz), durante o Paleoceno-Oligoceno; os lineamentos A, C e D durante o 

Mioceno; e os lineamentos A e E durante o Pleistoceno Superior ao Recente; 

h) estas estruturas estiveram ativas predominantemente como falhas de transferência, dividindo 

a Bacia de Santos em compartimentos; em particular, o lineamento A, que corresponde à 

extensão offshore de Alto Estrutural de Arujá, parece ter tido uma persistente e polifásica 

atividade durante o Cenozóico; 

i) os maiores campos de óleo na Bacia de Santos estão localizados na região contígua às bacias

ABSTRACT 

The Taubaté and Resende are NE-to-ENE-oriented Paleogene continental rift basins of 

the central segment of the Continental Rift of Southeastern Brazil. The Taubaté Basin, with 

about 170 km long and up to 20 km wide, and the Resende Basin, with 50 km long and up to 

8 km wide, were installed during the Eocene as a result of a NW-SE-oriented extensional 

stress field. This stress field reactivated NE-trending shear zones of the Precambrian basement 

as normal faults that played a major role during the basin installation and evolution. There are 

also numerous N-S, NE-SW and NW-SE-oriented structures transverse to the NE-trending 

basin axis. These structures comprise faults and folds that were active at different time 

intervals, but their role in the basin evolution is poorly understood yet. In order to recognize 

these structures in the subsurface in Taubaté Basin, five longitudinal seismic profiles were 

interpreted showing their distinctive character as normal and reverse faults, which intersect 

different seismic units and indicate a multiphase tectonic deformation. The presence of 

transverse structural highs, recognizable in the seismic profiles, which were active during the 



 

opening of the basin, can be related to anticlines formed in the hangingwall during an 

evolution related to the growing of the border master faults in a NW-SE-trending extensional 

regime. Moreover, syn-sedimentary NW-SE-oriented transverse normal faults oblique to the 

ENE-orientation of the border master faults were described in outcrops in the Resende Basin. 

These structures are interpreted as release faults (in the sense of Destro, 1995 and Destro et 

al., 2003) and thus formed in the same extensional context. Stratigraphic relationships and 

paleostress analysis of fault populations indicate that transverse structures are related to four 

deformational events: a NE-SW-oriented compression probably during the Miocene, a NW-

SE-oriented compression in the Late Pleistocene to Holocene, an E-W-to-NW-SE-oriented 

extension in the Holocene and lastly, an E-W-oriented compression related to the present-day 

stress field. The evolution of the adjoining offshore Santos Basin during the Cenozoic has a 

narrow correlation with the formation and evolution of Taubaté and Resende basins. The 

migration of depocenters in the Santos Basin during the Cenozoic can be associated with the 

presence of NW-SE-oriented transverse structures, changes in the stress fields, and generation 

and deformation events in the continental rift basins. 

  



 

1. INTRODUCTION 

The Continental Rift of Southeastern Brazil (CRSB, Riccomini, 1989) is an elongate 

narrow geomorphologic depression of Paleogene age, over 900 km long, that is roughly 

parallel to the current coastline. It developed over medium to low grade metamorphic rocks 

within the domain of the Ribeira Folded Belt (Hasui et al., 1975), of Paleo- to Neoproterozoic 

age, and intrusive granitoid rocks of Neoproterozoic age (v.g. Alves et al., 2013).  

 

Figure 1 - Research area (adapted from Marques, 1990, and Almeida, 1976). 

Major rock anisotropy and weak zones of the Ribeira Belt are the result of 

metamorphism, which occurred during the Brasiliano Orogeny. At the end of the Brasiliano 

event, the central sector of this belt was affected by multiple strike-slip faults (Souza et al., 

2009). According to Campanha (2002), post-Brasiliano evolution is related to the transition 

and reactivation stages of the Brazilian Plataform, passing through a Mesozoic event with 

expressive vertical movements followed by basic and alkaline magmatism (v.g. Riccomini, 

2005), up to the development of the Continental Rift of Southeastern Brazil during the 

Cenozoic. 



 

The Continental Rift of Southeastern Brazil may be subdivided in three segments: the 

Western, the Central (hosting São Paulo, Taubaté, Resende and Volta Redonda basins) and 

the Eastern segments (Riccomini et al., 2004). The Taubaté and Resende basins (Figure 1) are 

tectonic depressions located between the Serra do Mar and Serra da Mantiqueira, in the 

central segment of the Continental Rift of Southeastern Brazil. 

The Taubaté Basin is the largest basin in the rift system, and is about 170 km long and 

20 km wide. Seismic data (Marques, 1990) corroborated by gravimetric data (Fernandes and 

Chang, 2002) indicates that it is composed of six depocenters separated by structural highs 

associated to NW-SE-oriented normal faults. The basement depth reach up to 850 m. The 

Resende Basin also belongs to the central segment of the CRSB and it is located northeast of 

Taubaté Basin. It is elongated in the ENE-WSW-direction (N75E, Ramos et al., 2006), with 

50 km long and up to 8 km wide, and the basin holds the same geological evolution as the 

Taubaté Basin. 

The main phase of development of the Continental Rift of Southeastern Brazil occurred 

during the Eocene-Oligocene, and the syn-tectonic sedimentary filling corresponds to the 

Taubaté Group (Riccomini et al., 2004). 

According to Marques (1990), the structural framework of the Taubaté Basin is defined 

by two major types of structures: right-lateral strike-slip faults, intersecting all sedimentary 

section, longitudinally to the basin, and normal transverse faults, controlling asymmetric 

horsts and grabens that delineate the six sub-basins (called from SW to NE: Parateí, Jacareí, 

Eugênio de Melo, Quiririm, Roseira and Lorena).  

Fernandes and Chang (2002) identified two structural highs that were considered 

transfer zones, in the sense of Gibbs (1984, 1990). These highs subdivide the basin into three 

compartments, as hemigrabens, designated São José dos Campos, Taubaté and Aparecida, 

being the two structural highs denominated Caçapava High and Pindamonhangaba High.  



 

Riccomini (1989) recognized two systems of transverse faults in the CRSB, the NNE- 

and the NNW-trending systems. The NNE-trending system presents an array of dominantly 

right-lateral strike-slip faults with associated negative and positive flower structures, as well 

as normal and reverse faults. This system also controls structural highs, locally with 

exposition of Precambrian basement rocks, and lows. The NNW-trending system comprises 

dominantly normal and left-lateral strike-slip faults that prevail over reverse and right-lateral 

strike-slip. This fault system seems to control the Arujá structural high, which exposes 

Precambrian basement rocks and separates the São Paulo and Taubaté basins (Riccomini, 

1989). 

Folding of regional scale was recognized from borehole data in the area bounded by the 

cities of Taubaté, São José dos Campos and Pindamonhangaba (Riccomini, 1989). Takiya et 

al. (1990) investigated these structures in Tremembé Formation using geostatistical kriging. 

The results indicated the presence of NNW-trending conical folds that are correlatable to 

mesoscopic folds recognized in outcrops of Tremembé Formation (Riccomini, 1989). These 

folds resulted from a NE-SW-compression occurred during the Miocene. During the 

Pleistocene, border faults from rift phase were reactivated, and the sedimentary rocks of 

Tremembé Formation were folded as a result of a NW-SE-oriented compression, creating a 

dome and basin pattern of interference (Riccomini, 1989, Silva, 2007). 

Therefore, there are transverse faults in the Taubaté and Resende basins unrelated to 

transfer zones, which nature and relationship with sedimentation are slight known. 

Furthermore, Souza et al. (2009) indicate that NW-SE-trending structures had acted during 

the evolution of the Santos Basin and these structures are persistent inward the continent, 

intercepting the Taubaté Basin.  

The Santos Basin has an area of 352.000 km2, facing the Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, 

Paraná and Santa Catarina states, Brazil. The basin was formed by rifting processes during 



 

Mesozoic Afro-American separation (Chang et al., 2008). The Ribeira Belt is also the main 

basement in the shallow area of the Santos Basin, which sedimentary filling is typical of a 

divergent boundary, formed by continental, transitional and marine sequences, with up to 

13.000 m thick (Chang and Kowsmann, 1984). As a result of recent oil and gas discoveries, 

the Santos Basin emerges as an auspicious exploratory frontier in Brazil. Nonetheless, its 

substantial area allied to scarcity of data and information about its geology grants it a limited 

known basin status (Chang et al., 2008). 

The control played by release and transfer faults on the distribution of oil and gas fields 

has been suggested in recent studies (v.g. Destro et al., 2003). Identification of these types of 

faults in the Santos Basin requires seismic surveys, while their study in the adjoining onshore 

portion is highly facilitated by the possibility of direct observation. In this scenario, the 

tectonic evolution of the Taubaté and Resende basins is relevant to understanding the 

Cenozoic tectonic evolution of the Santos Basin. The identification of transverse structures in 

onshore portion certainly will be valuable in the study of the tectonic framework of the Santos 

Basin, with clear implications for oil and gas exploration. 

Thus, this paper aims to analyze the transverse structures in the Taubaté and Resende 

basins with focus on their nature, geometry, kinematics, relationship with sedimentation, age, 

the stress field active during their generation and deformation, and regional correlations.  We 

discuss the possible physical continuity of these structures and / or the action of stress fields 

related to them into the Santos Basin and the implications for the tectonic framework and 

evolution of this basin. 

 



 

2. REGIONAL GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

The opening of South Atlantic initiated in the Early Cretaceous (v.g. Moulin et al., 

2010), and is well documented by the huge basaltic volcanism and associated dikes and sills 

(Serra Geral Formation and correlated rocks). 

It is assumed that both the Santos Basin and Serra do Mar escarpments started to 

develop at the end of this magmatic phase, although the controls on the current physiography 

of the coastal region of southeastern Brazil are still a matter of debate. Some authors proposed 

that the escarpments of the Serra do Mar result of secondary flexural bulge during the rift 

phase that would have persisted to the present day (Sacek et al., 2012). Fission-track data, 

however, indicates a rejuvenation of the topography by uplift during the Cenozoic (Hiruma et 

al., 2010; Cogné et al., 2011. 2012). Moreover, according to Franco-Magalhães et al. (2014), 

zircon fission-track data indicates a regional uplift during Early Cretaceous followed by 

strong erosion, and may reflect thermally driven tectonic activity. Yet, during the Late 

Cretaceous there was an uplift marked by intense alkaline magmatism without evidence of 

tectonism. At that time, the resulting highlands of Serra do Mar and Serra da Mantiqueira 

mountain ranges were the main source area for Late Cretaceous sediments of the passive 

margin basins (Santos and Campos basins) and the cratonic basin (Bauru Basin).  

The structures of the Brasiliano Cycle had a strong influence on the disposition of the 

major features of the Continental Rift of Southeastern Brazil. The ENE-trend of the coastal 

region of southeastern Brazil is controlled by the Cambrian to Ordovician array of shear zones 

(Almeida, 1976). These shear zones were reactivated at the beginning of the Paleogene with a 

predominantly normal character, leading to syn-tectonic continental sedimentation of Taubaté 

Group (Riccomini et al., 1983, 1987, 1989; Melo et al., 1985), but the mechanisms that led to 

this reactivation are still poorly understood. Several models were proposed, as gravitational 



 

sliding (Almeida, 1976; Fernandes, 1993; Zalán and Oliveira, 2005), isostatic compensation 

(Asmus and Ferrari, 1978) and thermomechanical tilting (Riccomini, 1989). 

The origin of the CRSB was previously related to a transtensional regime, a model 

based on the interpretation of left-lateral movements along border faults, as in Zalán (1986), 

Sadowski and Dias Neto (1981), Padilha et al. (1991) as well in recent works as Cobbold et 

al. (2001) and Cogné and et al. (2013). According to Cobbold et al. (2001) the Serra do Mar 

was exhumed once more in the Maastrichtian-Eocene (70-50 Ma). Between the Paleocene and 

Oligocene (70-30 Ma), continental sediments were deposited in pull-apart basins in a right-

lateral transtensional regime, based on faults in Taubaté Basin that had northeast strikes, while 

striations had northerly pitches of 10°- 40°, indicating components of right-lateral slip, 

especially in syn-sedimentary faults. 

Ferrari (2001) highlighted some important differences between extensional basins and 

basins along strike-slip faults. According to Christie-Blick &amp;amp; Biddle (1985), basins along 

strike slip faults are distinct for some aspect of stratigraphic records that include: a tendency 

for longitudinal and lateral basin asymmetry, owing to the migration of the depocenters 

through time; evidence for episodic rapid subsidence, recorded by thick stratigraphic sections; 

and the occurrence of abrupt lateral facies changes and local unconformities. These 

characteristics were not found in the basins of the central segment of the CRSB. Thus the 

model of an initial NNW-SSE-oriented extension is accepted among several authors 

(Riccomini, 1989; Fernandes, 1993; Salvador, 1994; Ferrari, 2001; Riccomini et al., 2004; 

Zalán and Oliveira, 2005). This initial extensional phase is well documented by the normal 

character of the active master faults in the central segment of CRSB, as well as by data from 

striations and the continuity observed on proximal alluvial fan deposits and source areas 

(Riccomini et al., 2004).  



 

The syn-tectonic deposition in the Central segment of the Continental Rift of 

Southeastern Brazil, including the Taubaté and Resend basins, is encompassed in the Taubaté 

Group (Riccomini et al., 2004). The syn-rift deposition is represented by the Eocene to 

Oligocene Resende Formation, basal and lateral unit of the Taubaté Group comprising 

diamictite, polymictic conglomerate and massive mudstone with carbonate paleosoils of 

alluvial fan systems. Massive mudstone is laterally interbedded with cross-bedded sandstone 

of alluvial plains of braided rivers in the inner parts of the basins. Ankaramite lava-flows of 

Eocene age occur in the Casa de Pedra Graben (Volta Redonda Basin), intercalated in alluvial 

mudstone. In the central part of the Taubaté Basin there are claystone, organic-rich shale 

(locally oil-shale), and minor layers of dolomite related to a lacustrine environment of 

Oligocene age, named as Tremembé Formation, which also comprises sandstone at the 

borders of the paleolake. The uppermost part of the syn-rift sequence is mainly composed of 

sandstone, claystone and minor conglomerates of a fluvial meandering system of the São 

Paulo Formation. 

The deformation phases involved reactivations along previous faults and subordinately 

the formation of new ones (Riccomini, 1989; Salvador and Riccomini, 1995; Riccomini et al., 

2004). During the Neogene (Miocene) the central segment of the CRSB was under the action 

of a strike-slip regime, with NW-SE-oriented extension and local NE-SW-oriented 

compression. This event changed the rift architecture, generating local uplifts and non-

cylindrical folds, as observed in lacustrine deposits of Tremembé Formation (Riccomini, 

1989; Takiya et al., 1990; Silva, 2007). The original rift depression was segmented by 

transverse NNW-SSE-oriented faults that generated structural highs related to transpression. 

Besides, these structures acted disconnecting the Taubaté Basin from São Paulo Basin, and 

reversed the course of the Paraíba do Sul River, from southwest to northeast, as a result of a 

headwater capture of the Tietê River (Riccomini et al., 2010). Sandstone and conglomerate of 

a fluvial braided system (Itaquaquecetuba Formation) were deposited in pull-apart basins 



 

developed over the structural high separating the São Paulo and Taubaté basins. The base 

level changed and restructured the Paraiba do Sul River drainage, especially in the central part 

of Taubaté Basin, resulting in erosion of Oligocene deposits, and the installation of a fluvial 

meandering system (Pindamonhangaba Formation), comprising conglomerate, sandstone, 

siltstone and claystone. After de sedimentation of Pindamonhangaba Formation there was a 

tectonic quiescence, with a deposition of colluvial and alluvial sediments, which are the result 

of relief remodeling caused by climate changes during the Quaternary (Riccomini, 1989).  

Widespread Quaternary neotectonic features along the CRSB are related to a NW-SE-

oriented Late Pleistocene-Holocene compressive stress regime followed, successively, by an 

E-W- to NW-SE-oriented Holocene extension and an E-W-oriented compression (Riccomini 

et al., 2004). These deformations are clearly evidenced by stone-lines (Ab’Sáber, 1962) that 

are often intercepted by faults, indicating a recent tectonic activity (Riccomini et al., 1989). 

During the NW-SE-compression, which occurred during the late Pleistocene to 

Holocene, the rift border faults were reactivated as strike-slip faults and reverse faults, whilst 

the activity of NNE-oriented faults generated structural highs, as Caçapava and Resende, 

separating the Paleogene sedimentary record into isolated basins. These faults intersect the 

fluvial deposits of the Pindamonhangaba Formation in the central part of the Taubaté Basin, 

as well as the stone-lines (Riccomini et al., 1989; 2004). 

From the early Holocene an E-W- to NW-ESE-oriented extension took place and it 

apparently shaped the sediment framework we know presently. It appears to be responsible 

for creating N-S-oriented valleys controlled by normal faults that intersects colluvial, alluvial 

and stone-line deposits aged from Late Pleistocene to Holocene (Salvador and Riccomini, 

1995; Riccomini et al. 1989, 2004). 

The last event, with an E-W-compressive character, occurred during the Holocene and 

is responsible for the reactivation of N-S-oriented faults as reverse faults, and created a 



 

widespread family of conjugate hybrid and shear joints in colluvial, alluvial and stone-line 

deposits (Salvador and Riccomini, 1995; Riccomini et al., 2004). This is the current stress 

regime in the region, as indicated by focal mechanism of earthquakes (Assumpção, 1992, 

1998; Lima et al., 1997). 

The stratigraphy and the evolution of stress fields in the central segment of the CRSB 

are summarized in Figure 2.

The Santos Basin evolution is related to the opening of the South Atlantic and to the 

events that generated and deformed the CRSB and consequently the Taubaté and Resende 

basins. Macedo (1989) pointed a correlation between the deformation of Santos Basin with 

tectonic pulses in the onshore continental area of southeastern Brazil, as indicated by turbidite 

deposits in Santos Basin. According to Meisling et al. (2001), the margin of southeastern 

Brazil was reactivated in three main phases that were related to three phases of Andean 

orogeny by Cobbold et al. (2001).  

The first one occurred in the Late Cretaceous with exhumation of Serra do Mar, the 

second in the Paleogene, with further exhumation of Serra do Mar, alkaline magmatism and 

formation of Paleogene basins, as the Taubaté Basin. The last one occurred during the 

Neogene, when Paleogene basins were inverted, and the supply of clastic sediments was 

diverted from Santos Basin to Campos Basin, and with the development of an anticline in 

Cabo Frio. 

Chang et al. (2008) summarized the evolution of Santos Basin into a rift phase and a 

passive margin phase. During the development of the syn-rift phase, the stress was confined, 

creating crustal faults. The later phase developed with the lithospheric crust thinning partly, 

which generated the formation of faults with lower dip. In a third phase, a sag basin was 

formed, with the deposition of the main source rock of Santos Basin. From this phase on, it 

occurred an expressive evaporitic sedimentation, during the Aptian. After the evaporitic phase 

it was installed a clastic deposition in the proximal region and a carbonate sedimentation, in 

the deep area. During the passive margin phase, in the Albian, the continents were separated 

and a significant subsidence has occurred, allowing the sea incursion and the development of 

a carbonate platform. According to Macedo (1989), this thermal subsidence caused a tilting of 

the tectonic blocks. Alluvial and fan delta deposits in proximal areas of this platform indicate 

tectonic movements in the continental area, maybe related to a new uplift of Serra do Mar. 



 

The carbonate platform extinction occurred in the Cenomanian, and this carbonate section 

was already deformed by halokinesis. Two transgressive sequences drowned the carbonate 

platform, one of that responsible for the deposition of the main source rock of post-rift phase, 

which is related to second anoxic event of the Cretaceous. During the Late Cretaceous, three 

phases of progradation caused the coastline retreat. These sedimentary pulses might be related 

to tectonic movements in the continent, as the uplift of Serra do Mar. Also, this period is 

correlated with the alkaline magmatism in the region. An extensional regime is suggested by 

the register of basic volcanism in Santos and Campos basins during the Eocene, which may be 

related to the initial extensional phase that originated the CRSB (Macedo, 1989). In the top of 

the Cenomanian sequence in the Santos Basin is recorded a regional unconformity, over 

which two progradational sequences were deposited. According to Chang et al. (2008), the 

Cenozoic section of Santos Basin records two unconformities, one in the Oligocene and other 

in the Miocene. Yet, in the Eocene it was installed a lowstand system tract, allowing the 

formation of a big turbidite reservoir (Figure 3).

Cohen et al., 2013) 



 

Assine et al. (2008) performed a sequence stratigraphic analysis using seismic lines and 

well data to demonstrate that depocenters in Santos Basin have migrated northeastwards 

during the Late Cretaceous into the Campos Basin, where the Tertiary section is well 

developed. It was evidenced that a Paleogene section is well developed in the north portion of 

the Santos Basin, and another important Paleogene and Neogene depocenter was in the 

southern portion of this basin. These depocenters were considered in terms of their relevance 

to understand the relation between the formation of reservoir rocks and the timing of 

petroleum generation and migration. The presence of transverse structures in the Santos 

Basin, related to different stress regimes during the Cenozoic, certainly represents a new 

element to be considered in the exploratory models for hydrocarbons. 

  



 

3. MATERIALS AND METHODS 

3.1. Field data 

Considering the controversies regarding the formation of transverse structures in 

Taubaté and Resende basins, the first step comprised the recognition of these structures in the 

previous papers and cartographic materials, selecting some of them as the most favorable to 

collect structural data in outcrops. Some of the available outcrops have a complex structural 

setting, being important to identify cross-cutting relationships between faults as well as the 

sedimentary deposits in order to have a relative age of these structures.  

With the purpose of determining the chronology of faulting it was used the method 

described by Angelier (1994), which considers the age of the rock formations affected or 

unaffected by faults, the geometrical relationship between fault motions and the mechanical 

consistency. It was also used the cross-cutting relationship between identified slickensides 

(motion striae), because some faults were reactivated under more than one deformation event. 

Another way to describe the chronology of different events is the observation of the cross-

cutting relationship between striae, the younger cutting the older. However, it is not easy to 

observe due to the fact that older events might be usually masked or even erased by younger 

events, hampering the reconstruction of the movements. 

Besides the collection of structural data during field survey, some outcrops were 

selected (especially because of their importance and data quality) for presentation as 

panoramas using the software GIMP 2 and Pandora script.  

3.2. Cartographic and seismic data 

In order to gather all the cartographic material as well as to analyze the digital elevation 

models, it was used the software Quantum GIS 2.6.1. Four ASTER images were selected, 



 

from The ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM), which is a joint product 

developed and made available to the public by the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry 

(METI) of Japan and the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration 

(NASA).  It is generated from data collected from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal 

Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), a spaceborne earth observing optical 

instrument. The post interval is 30 m and the digital elevation model accuracy is between 7 

and 14 m. The hydrography was obtained from Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística 

(IBGE, in www.ibge.gov.br) while the structural and geological maps were obtained from 

GEOBANK, from CPRM, Brazil Geological Survey, in geobank.cprm.gov.br. 

The seismic profiles were obtained from Cogné et al. (2013). Only seismic profiles 

parallel to the Taubaté basin axis were selected, as they supposedly can provide the better 

view of transverse structures. 

Furthermore, the isopach maps of Santos Basin were obtained from Assine et al. (2008), 

in order to compare the depocenter migration in the Santos Basin with the deformation events 

observed in the Taubaté and Resende basins.  

3.3. Structural data analysis 

The right dihedra method of fault analysis, proposed by Angelier &amp;amp; Mechler (1977), 

was employed to determine the paleostress fields. It is a graphical method that allows defining 

a reliable region where are the main stress axes from fault-slip data. Combining constrains 

from several faults related to each other allows the definition of ?1?and??3 orientation fields 

that are compatible with different percentages of the faults (Orife and Lisle, 2006). The 

orientation of the ?1 axis must belong to the compressional dihedron, whereas the orientation 

of the ?3 axis belongs to extensional dihedron. Consequently, where two or more fault slips 



 

have occurred in the same stress regime, the main axes must belong to the corresponding 

dihedron for all the faults mechanism (Angelier, 1994). 

If the slips on a set of faults all result from a single stress tensor, the stereogram should 

display ?1 and ?3 orientations regions compatible with 100% of faults (Orife and Lisle, 2006). 

In other words, in projection, all areas, which are not homogenous in terms of compressional 

and extensional dihedron, are progressively erased. As a result, the residual areas indicate the 

range of possibilities for the main stress axes (Angelier, 1994). Figure 4 summarizes the 

characteristics of right dihedral and the fault slip mechanism.  

 

Figure 4 - Right dihedra and the fault slip mechanism. a) Perspective view. b) Stereogram, lower hemisphere. F:  
fault plane; A: auxiliary plane; n: normal to fault plane; s: unit slip vector in (a), reverse right-lateral slickenside 
lineation in (b); B: intersection of planes A and F; P: compressional dihedron; T: extensional dihedron (adapted 
from Angelier, 1994). 

This method was applied making use of the software T-Tecto 3.0 (Žalohar and Vrabec, 

2007) that enables classical and micropolar analysis of heterogeneous and homogeneous fault 

slip data using several different numerical method, including the Gauss method. It is based on 

the classical philosophy of fault-slip data inversion that consists of determining the stress 

tensor knowing the direction and the sense of slip on numerous faults of various orientations 

(Angelier, 1994). The Gauss method separates heterogeneous fault system in homogenous 

fault subsystem, and it was described by Žalohar and Vrabec (2007). The optimal solution for 



 

stress tensors that activated the observed faults is found by searching for the global and 

highest local maxima of the object function defined as a sum of compatibility functions for all 

slip-data.  

Additionally it was used a Multiple-slip method visualization that is the sum of the 

compressional and extensional field for all faults, which leads to the common P and T fields. 

The structural data collected was processed through the worksheet Tectonics FP 1.6.1 in 

order to adequate the information from faults and slickenside striae (strike 

dip/dip//trend/plunge and movement sense) besides the reliability height to T-Tecto 3.0 entry.  

Moreover the structural stereograms were traced by T-Tecto 3.0, using the Wulf net 

(equal angle projections), lower hemisphere. 

  



 

4. DATA AND INTERPRETATION 

4.1. Seismic data 

The 178 km of 2D seismic profiles were acquired for PETROBRAS in the 1980’s and 

were presented previously in Marques (1990), Carvalho et al. (2011) and Cogné et al. (2013). 

The earlier interpretation was done by Marques (1990), nonetheless the image resolution was 

poor. In Cogné et al. (2013) high-resolution images were presented, allowing the 

interpretations presented in this paper. 

The location of interpreted longitudinal seismic profiles is presented in Figure 5. 

 

Figure 5 - Location of seismic lines over geological map (modified from Marques, 1990 and Perrota et al., 2005) 

Marques (1990) identified four seismic units, comprising the basement, seismic unit A, 

seismic unit B and Taubaté Group. Cogné et al. (2013) divided the Taubaté Group into 

Resende and Tremembé formations. In this paper it has been adopted the stratigraphic 

succession from Marques (1990) and Cogné et al. (2013).  



 

The seismic lines were overlaid on geological map (Perrota et al., 2005) in order to 

guide the location in surface of Resende and Tremembé contacts. The top of Taubaté Group, 

corresponding to a regional unconformity overlain by the Pindamonhangaba Formation, was 

not considered by the reason that its thickness is less than 30 m, which makes this unit not 

distinguishable on seismic profile due to scale proportions. The same occurs with colluvial 

and alluvial covers. Marques (1990) attributed a Late Cretaceous age for seismic units A and 

B and they are not exposed or drilled by wells. Nevertheless, research based on apatite and 

zircon-fission track indicates a post-rift period of exhumation during Late Cretaceous to Early 

Paleocene and the area where the central segment of the Continental Rift of Southeastern 

Brazil were installed was uplifted (Cogné et al., 2013). Furthermore, the first stages of 

development of the CRSB are from the Paleocene, which is recorded on the travertines of São 

José de Itaboraí Basin (Ricomini et al., 2004). Hence, it is possible to assume a Paleogene (up 

to Early Eocene) age to the units A and B in the Taubaté Basin. 

In order to identify the different seismic units the following criteria were used: 

? basement reflector unit: it is defined as the deepest strong and continuous reflector; the 

seismic energy returned weak below this surface except for the multiples reflections - 

multiply reflected seismic energy, or any event in seismic data that has incurred more 

the one reflection in its travel path (Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary, 1998) – that 

occurs in some profiles with major significance; and the shape of the surface of 

basement that may be related to a paleorelief;  

? reflector Unit A: it is identified by a strong reflector at the top and non-structured 

reflectors below; according to Marques (1990), Unit A is a basal unit, laid directly 

over the basement, which is not exposed, and is considered as coarse clastic 

sediments; 



 

? reflector Unit B: it is described as a strong reflector at the top and with some 

structuration below it and the reflectors below are thinly layered; according to 

Marques (1990), the Unit B is discordantly laid over Unit A, and it is composed of 

rhythmic mudstone at the base grading to sandy sediments at the top; 

? Resende Formation: it is formed by strong and parallel reflectors that are sometimes 

deformed by faults; 

? Tremembé Formation: it grades laterally, so it was identified using the geological 

map; at the base a strong reflector was used to mark the transition between Resende 

and Tremembé formations. 

Marques (1990) identified some flower structures that indicates strike-slip faults. Cogné 

et al. (2013) did not found these structures in high-resolution seismic lines, assigned them as 

normal and reverse faults, as in this paper. 

Seismic profile 225-0061 

The segment covered by this line (Figure 6) was denominated by Marques (1990) as 

Eugênio de Melo Sub-basin, and it is delimitated by two structural highs. The structural high 

to the west was called Caçapava High, where basement crops out in the central part of the 

basin (Marques, 1990).



 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 6 - Seismic profile 225-0061 (modified from Cogné et al., 2013) 

 



 

 

In the geological map, it is possible to observe that there are two major structures with 

NW-trending direction, which intercept the profile and are located in the structural highs. 

These structural highs are faulted in seismic profile. The basement depth is approximately 300 

ms TWT, but in the structural highs it is shallower, reaching no more than 8 ms TWT. 

Moreover, it is deformed by pre- and post-sedimentary faults, and presents reverse and normal 

faults. Features like folds in the basement are also present, as previously recognized by Cogné 

et al. (2013).  

Laying over the basement in an erosional contact is the Unit B. In this profile was not 

possible to recognize the Unit A.  

The upper reflector unit is the Taubaté Group, formed by the Resende and Tremembé 

formations. The contact between these two units is lateral and was traced based on geological 

map. In the seismic profile it was not possible to recognize any syn-sedimentary fault. All 

faults are post sedimentary and present normal character. 

Seismic profile 225-0059 

The segment of Figure 7 was denominated as Quiririm Sub-basin by Marques (1990). 

According to geological map, the unit exposed at the surface is the Tremembé Formation. The 

basement overtakes 500 ms TWT deep in some areas, and it is highly deformed by normal 

and reverse faults. In this profile, the Unit B rests directly over the basement and there is no 

register of Unit A. The sedimentary pack formed by Unit B, Resende and Tremembé 

formations is intersected by faults, especially at SW. These structures are very steep and 

present normal character. The thickness of sedimentary units seems to decrease to NE while 

the basement becomes shallower. 

 



 

 

 

 

 

Figure 7 – Seismic profile 225-0059 (modified from Cogné et al., 2013) 

 



 

 

Seismic profile 225-0064 

In Marques (1990) this profile comprises the Capela do Socorro High (Figure 8), later 

denominated as Pindamonhangaba high by Fernandes (1993), separating the Quiririm and 

Roseira sub-basins. According to Riccomini. (2004), this high corresponds to an anticline 

trending NW-SE.  

Evaluating the sedimentary succession, there is no Unit A, and the Unit B is 

immediately laid over the basement, with depth up to 300 ms TWT. The Unit B and the 

Resende Formation are thinner over the structural high when compared to the adjoining areas. 

The superficial unit in the geological map is the Pindamonhangaba Formation. Nevertheless, 

it is not visible in the seismic scale, thus it was represented the formation bellow with 

thickness consistent with the seismic scale. 

According to geological map, there is a NNE-oriented fault that intercepts this profile 

between 300 and 400 and might be associated to the fault set located at 350. This fault 

presents a clear variation in thickness of Unit B and Resende Formation, the former thicker to 

the west and the latter thicker to the east, which suggests a strike-slip movement. Most faults 

that are deforming the sedimentary pack are normal in the vertical section, although there are 

some faults with reverse components. 



 

 

 

Figure 8 - Seismic profile 225-0064 (modified from Cogné et al., 2013) 

 



 

 

Seismic profiles 225-0065 and 225-0063 

The area crossed by these two profiles corresponds to the Roseira Sub-basin (Marques, 

1990), and there is some overlap between the two profiles (for location see Figure 5). All the 

seismic units are present in these profiles, and this is the only sub-basin that includes the Unit 

A, the oldest in the Taubaté Basin. In the seismic profile 225-0065 (Figura 10), the 

sedimentary pack is very deformed. Most faults are intercepting all units, including the 

basement, which depth is up to 700 ms TWT. In these segments it is possible to observe the 

major depth registered in the studied sections in the Taubaté Basin. 

The structures are very steep, and dip at times to SW and so to NE, and can be normal 

or reverse. In the geological map, a major NNW-oriented fault intercepts this profile at 600 

and it may be related to the fault set between 600 and 700. Another major fault is identified in 

the geological map, but it not intercepts the profile. It is a NNE-oriented fault that may be 

covered by Quaternary sediments, so it is possible that it intercepts the profile. A fault set at 

400 could be related to this NNE-oriented fault. Most faults apparently end before 

intercepting the Tremembé Formation probably due to the surface interference and 

consequently inadequate information on the first meters of these profiles.  

The seismic profile 225-0063 (Figure 9) presents the basement highly deformed 

although the sedimentary pack is intercepted by a few faults. A major NNW-oriented fault can 

be identified in the geological map and intercepts the profile 225-0063 at around 400. There 

are some fault sets between 350 and 450 that may be related to this fault. All units are 

identifiable, and it is possible to observe a sedimentary thickening from W to E. Unlike the 

profile 225-0065 the faults described in this profile do not intercept all units, being restricted 

to certain units.

4.2.  Structural data 

Based on previous data and filed work, 17 outcrops with transverse faults were selected 

for structural analysis (see location in Figure 11). Of these, 11 are in the Taubaté Basin, with a 

major concentration near the Caçapava Structural High, three in the region of separation 

between the São Paulo and Taubaté basins, three in the Resende Basin and one in the latest 

Cretaceous Itatiaia alkaline massif (northwest of Resende Basin).

brown line - reverse faults; green line – strike-slip faults; arrow –striae (geological and structural map from 
GEOBANK; adapted from Perrota et al., 2005 and Leite et al., 2004) 



 

 

Fault-slip data inversion and paleostress determination using the software T-Tecto 3.0, 

and relationship between faults and sediments, allowed to identify five tectonic events as 

described below. 

NW-SE-oriented extension (Eocene - Oligocene) 

The NW-SE-oriented extensional event is related to the rift opening during the Eocene - 

Oligocene. According to Riccomini (1989), this phase is correlated to the sedimentary filling 

of Taubaté Group (formed by Resende, Tremembé and São Paulo formations), and is well 

documented mainly in ENE to E-W-trending border faults, which follow the structural 

direction of ancient shear zones of Precambrian basement. This fault system is widespread in 

the central segment of CRSB. 

An outcrop previously studied by Cassini (2011), at the NE boundary of Resende Basin, 

site T-13 (Figures 12 and 13), presents E-W to NW-SE-oriented syn-sedimentary normal 

faults transverse to the Resende Basin axis. Some of these faults are low-angle normal faults. 

Individual throw ranges from a few centimeters up to some decimeters. There is a NNW-SSE-

oriented oblique strike-slip with a vertical displacement of about 1m.  

 

Figure 12 - Outcrop of site T-13. Most of faults are normal and syn-sedimentary. The rocks of Resende 
Formation are folded and intercepted by an oblique strike-slip fault, related to a later deformational event. 

The mudstone, conglomerate and sandstone of Resende Formation are deformed by 

faults and folds. Clay injection were observed along some normal faults. All the normal faults 

were considered syn-sedimentary, as the faults do not crosses the upper layers (Figure 13).  



 

 

 

Figure 13 – Site T-13: detail of a low-angle normal fault (hammer as scale) 

The oblique strike-slip fault and the folds were interpreted as a later deformation, due to 

fact that either affect all the sedimentary succession. This section corresponds to the upper 

part of the Taubaté Group as nearby the deposits of the Resende Formation are laterally 

interfingered with those of the São Paulo Formation.  

Paleostress analysis of the population of normal faults indicates an extensional field 

trending NE-SW, with a vertical compressional field (Figure 14a).  

At site T-12, in the north border of Taubaté Basin (Figures 11 and 14b), one NNE-

SSW-oriented normal fault with a left-lateral strike-slip component was measured. The fault 

dips to SE, intercepts deposits of the Resende Formation and marks the tectonic contact 

between conglomerate of alluvial fan to the northwesthwest and and fluvial mudstone and 

sandstone to the southeast. The minimum throw is over 7 m and the fault presents a syn-

sedimentary character as the sedimentary layers grow in thickness toward the footwall. This 

transverse fault is oblique to the NE-oriented master faults at this part of the Taubaté Basin.

while red is the compressional field 

 

NE-SW-oriented compression and NW-SE-oriented extension (Miocene) 

The stress regime with NE-SW-oriented compression and NW-SE-oriented extension is 

related to the first deformational event in the CRSB. It corresponds to the event of left-lateral 

transcurrence proposed by Riccomini (1989). Two outcrops presented transverse faults 

associated to this deformational event, T-05 and T-09 (Figure 15). 

The fault data of site T-05 were obtained entirely within the domain of the Late 

Cretaceous Itatiaia alkaline massif, northwest of the Resende Basin. This massif is mainly 

composed of nepheline syenite (Riccomini et al., 2005) and surrounded by Precambrian 

metamorphic rocks of Ribeira Belt. The continuity of these fault zones into the Resende Basin 

indicates that it is younger than the Eocene-Oligocene Resende Formation (Riccomini et al., 

2004). A total of 25 faults were measured, most of them strike-slip, with two main directions, 

WNW-ESE and NNE-SSW, both subvertical. Among the NNE-SSW-oriented faults, three are 

reverse faults and three strike-slip. The WNW-ESE-oriented population of faults comprises 

mainly strike-slip faults. 

a b 



 

 

Paleostress analysis of this fault population indicates a NW-SE-oriented extensional 

field and a NE-SW-compressional field, in a transcurrent regime (Figure 15 a). According to 

Riccomini (1989), the WNW-ESE- and NNE-SSW-oriented structures acted as synthetic and 

antithetic strike-slip faults, respectively. 

At site T-09, a sandy quarry in Itaquaquecetuba, next to the Arujá Structural High, NE-

SW- to WNW-ESE-oriented predominantly normal faults and subordinately left-lateral strike-

slip faults with normal components affect sandstone and conglomerate of the Miocene 

Itaquaquecetuba Formation. Some of these faults area clearly syn-sedimentary with individual 

throw of up to 4 m. Paleostress analysis of this fault population indicates a NW-SE-oriented 

extensional field (Figure 15 b). 

 

 

 

 

Figure 15 –NE-SW-oriented compressional paleostress field obtained from fault population of site T-05 (a) and 
T-09 (b). Blue and red are the extensional and the compressional fields, respectively. 

 

NW-SE-oriented compression and NE-SW-oriented extension (Late Pleistocene – Holocene) 

The stress regime comprising NW-SE-oriented compression and NE-SW-oriented 

extension corresponds to the second deformational event in the CRSB, or the event of right-

lateral transcurrence proposed by Riccomini (1989). Transverse faults related to this event 

were studied at sites T-01, T-03 and T-06 (Figure 11). 

a b 



 

 

Site T-01 is a large road cut along the Carvalho Pinto highway, nearby the Caçapava 

High, in the central part of the Taubaté Basin. Fault population of this site includes 

predominantly NW-SE-oriented normal faults, with variations to N-S and WNW-ESE, with 

medium to high dips (up to subvertical) predominantly to NE and E. These faults truncate 

mudstones of the Resende Formation and, in two cases, sandy clayey colluvium of 

Quaternary age. Individual measured throw ranges from decimeters to more than 6 m (Figure 

16). One NW-SE-trending subvertical fault shows two striae, the older suggesting a right-

lateral strike-slip and the younger a normal movement. Paleostress determination (Figure 17a) 

indicates a clear NE-SW-oriented extension.  

 

 

Figure 16 – Site T-01, road cut along the Carvalho Pinto Highway, located near Caçapava Velha. The outcrop is 
80 m long approximately 

Site T-06 is located at the southwestern part of the Taubaté Basin in an isolated 

occurrence of sedimentary rocks of the São Paulo Formation near to a reverse fault in the 

Precambrian basement rocks (Riccomini 1989). This deformation is probably related to the 

context of the Arujá Structural High that separates the São Paulo Basin from Taubaté Basin. 

Fault population comprises reverse and strike-slip faults with reverse components trending 



 

 

NW-SE and NE-SW (Figure 16b). NE-SW-trending faults are basement-controlled whilst 

NW-SE to N-S-trending faults are transverse structures. Paleostress determination (Figure 

17b) indicates a clear NW-SE-oriented compression with a NE-SW-oriented extensional 

component. 

 

 

Figure 17 - NW-SE-oriented compression and NE-SW-oriented extension. In: a) T-01; b) T-06; c) T-13. Blue is 
the extensional field while red is the compressional field  

The strike-slip fault in site T-13 at the northern border of the Resende Basin intercepts 

the normal syn-sedimentary transverse structures related to the rift installation, and are 

associated with folding. Paleostress determination (Figure 17c) clearly indicates NW-SE-

oriented compression and a NE-SW-oriented extensional, in a strike-slip regime of 

deformation. 

E-W to NW-SE-oriented extension (Holocene) 

According to Riccomini (1989) and Riccomini et al. (2004) the stress-field with E-W- 

to NW-SE-oriented extension has affected the colluvial and alluvial deposits of Pleistocene to 

Holocene age. It corresponds to the third deformational event in the CRSB. Transverse faults 

related to this event could be observed directly in seven places. With the exception of T-10 

c a b 



 

 

site, located in the central region of Resende Basin, all other are in the central part of Taubaté 

Basin. 

Site T-10 is located in the central part of the Resende Basin in the region of the Resende 

Structural High. NNW-SSE- to NE-SW-oriented post-sedimentary normal faults with 

moderate dip to the W intercepts deposits of the Resende and São Paulo formations, as well as 

stone line and colluvium. Individual fault throw reach more 5 m. Paleostress analysis allowed 

the determinations of an E-W-oriented direction of extension (Figure 18a). 

At Site T-14, south of São José dos Campos (Taubaté Basin), a N-S-oriented, 

subvertical normal fault affects mudstone of the Resende Formation with a minimum throw of 

2 m (Figure 18b). An E-W-direction of extension can be deduced for this fault. Due the 

subvertical dip this fault probably results from reactivation of an older strike-slip fault. 

Site T-11 is located southeast of Taubaté. It was studied by Riccomini et al. (1989) and 

comprises a set of predominantly N-S- to NNE-SSW-oriented conjugate normal faults with 

moderate to high dips. Individual fault throw reaches more than 8 m (Figure 18c). Faults are 

post-sedimentary and affects fluvial meandering deposits (alternate layers of sandstone and 

mudstone) of the Pindamonhangaba Formation as well as overlying stone-line and a sandy 

colluvium. Paleostress analysis pointed a general E-W- to WNW-ESE-oriented direction of 

extension for this fault population. Some of these faults are subvertical and terminates in 

negative flower structures. 

Sites T-07, T-08, T-15 and T-16 are located near Caçapava, in the region of the 

Caçapava Structural High, Taubaté Basin. Site T-08 is a road cut at Presidente Dutra Highway 

and was studied by Riccomini et al. (1989). A set of NNW-SSE to NNE-SSW-oriented 

conjugate normal faults with moderate to high dips, and presenting individual throws from 

decimeters to more than 1 m affects fluvial deposits of the Pindamonhangaba Formation, 



 

 

stone-line and colluvium (Figure 18d). Site T-08, previously studied by Mancini (1995) is a 

road cut along the Caçapava to Caçapava Velha secondary road and comprises conjugate NE-

SW and N-S-oriented normal faults with moderate dips affecting deposits of the 

Pindamonhangaba Formation (Figure 18e).  

Sites T-15 and T-16 are located in the area of construction of a new airport (Aerovale) 

near Caçapava Velha. At site T-15 a normal fault trending NNE with moderate dip to WNW 

(Figure 18f), with a minimum throw of 4 m, truncates mudstone and sandstone of the Resende 

Formation and controls a syn-tectonic deposition of a Holocene muddy to pebbly colluvium, 

as evidenced by the thickening of the colluvial deposit towards the fault surface (Figure 19). 

Site T-16 displays two families of normal faults, one trending NE-SW with moderate to high 

dips to NW and throws from 0.5 to 3 m, and the other, transverse, trending N-S- to NW-SE 

(Figure 18g), with moderate dips and individual throws from 1 to more than 6 m. Cross-

cutting relationship between the two families suggests that they are conjugate (v.g. Caputo, 

1995). These faults truncate sandstone and mudstone of the Resende Formation as well as 

overlying stone-line and sandy-clayey colluvium (Figures 20 and 21). 

Paleostress determinations indicate a general E-W- (sites T-07 and 16) to WNW-ESE- 

(sites T-15 and 16) oriented direction of extension for the analyzed faults.

E-W-oriented compression (current stress-field)  

The last deformational event is related to an E-W-oriented compression (Salvador and 

Riccomini, 1995). Transverse faults related to the E-W-oriented compressional field were 

studied in four sites. 

Site T-04 is situated along the Jaguari Fault Zone (Figure 11), a Neoproterozoic shear 

zone that limits an isolated occurrence of sedimentary deposits of the São Paulo Formation in 

the southwestern part of the Taubaté Basin. All faults of this site have reverse component of 



 

 

movement and show variable strikes and low to high dip angles at this basin (Figure 22a). 

Paleostress analysis indicate an E-W-oriented compression. 

Sites T-02 and T-03 were previously studied by Mancini (1995) and are located in the 

context of the Caçapava Structural High (Figure 11). Site T-02 comprise two faults affecting 

deposits of the Pindamonhangaba Formation. One is NW-SE-oriented, left-lateral strike-slip, 

and the other a NE-SW-oriented, right-lateral strike-slip fault, both with normal components 

and moderate dip to NE and NW, respectively. Site T-03 comprises two N-to-NNE-oriented 

reverse faults, with moderate dip angles to the E, affecting deposits of the Resende Formation 

(Figures 22b, c). Faults of these sites are compatible with an E-W-oriented compression. 

Site T-17 is located in the Resende Structural High and was previously studied by 

Riccomini (1989) and Riccomini et al. (1989) (Figure 11). It comprise thrust and strike-slip 

faults with reverse components, with variable orientations and individual throws from some 

centimeters to more than 1 m. They affect deposits of the São Paulo Formation, fluvial 

terraces, stone-line and colluvium.  

Paleostress analysis pointed a general E-W- to WNW-ESE-oriented direction of 

compression for this fault population (Figure 22c).

4.3. Isopach maps of Santos Basin 

Although there are some research that have connected faults offshore and onshore, 

structural maps displaying transverse faults in the passive margin basins of southeastern 

Brazil are unavailable in the literature, as a result of conditions of use and confidentiality by 

oil companies. For this reason, in order to relate the tectonic events in the Taubaté Basin with 

the Santos Basin were selected isopach maps of Santos Basin, published in the superb paper 

by Assine et al.(2008), relative to the interval from Upper Campanian-Maastrichtian, with the 

uplift of the region of Serra do Mar and Serra da Mantiqueira ranges, until Upper Miocene-

Recent. The depocenter migration may be related to formation of structures induced by 

tectonic forces that may acted in continental and marine areas. 

The Upper Campanian to Maastrichtian time-interval preceded the installation of the 

Contintental Rift of Southeastern Brazil. In the continent occurred the alkaline magmatism 

and the uplift of the area that nowadays encompasses to the Serra do Mar and Serra da 

Mantiqueira. According to Assine et al. (2008), the sedimentary sequence is characterized by 

progradational coastal system, related to a major availability of sediments from continental 

area.

Central Segment of Continental Rift of Southeastern Brazil (modified from Assine et al., 2008.  

In the Figure 23 it is possible to observe three main depocenters that are separated by 

two major NW-SE-trending structures. The region of greater accumulation of sediments are 

mainly in front of the uplifted area of Serra do Mar and Serra da Mantiqueira. 

The formation of original depression of the Continental Rift of Southeastern Brazil 

occurred in the Paleogene, being the oldest basin (São João do Itaboraí Basin) from the 

Paleocene-Eocene (Riccomini et al., 2004). The isopach map of Figure 24 covers the Paleocene 

to Eocene/Lower Oligocene time-interval, and comprehends the installation and deposition of 

the rift section of the CRSB. 



 

 

 

Figure 24 - Isopach maps of Santos Basin during the Paleocene - Oligocene. In orange: basins of the Central 
Segment of Continental Rift of Southeastern Brazil; in red: lineaments (modified from Assine et al., 2008). 

According to Assine et al. (2008) the limit between Cretaceous and Paleogene is an 

important unconformity that coincides with a global sea level fall. The depocenters are 

elongated with strike almost parallel to the coastal line, and roughly parallel to the CRSB. The 

sedimentary package are thicker near the Cabo Frio High, structure that separate the Santos 

Basin from Campos Basin. The thinner sedimentary packs occur near the coastline in the São 

Paulo state. Some authors, as Zalán and Oliveira (2005), defined that the flat surface in the 

basement in the continental platform of the Santos Basin represents a regional planation 

surface, named as Japi Surface of the end of Cretaceous (Almeida, 1964), in its lower limit. 

The alignment of depocenters in Santos Basin would be a repercussion of the NW-SE-

oriented extensional field. Two main structures can be observed with probable link between 

the Santos Basin and the adjoining continental área: a) the Arujá Structural High, which 

separates the São Paulo and Taubaté basins and whose prolongation offshore marks the left-



 

 

lateral displacement of ENE-WSW-oriented depocenters in Santos Basin (Figure 24, 

lineament A); b) the Queluz Structural High, which separates the Taubaté and Resende basins, 

causing a right-lateral displacement of depocenters in Santos Basin (Figure 24, lineament B).  

Isopach map of Upper Miocene to Lower Miocene time-interval (Figure 25) clearly 

shows the permanence of the lineament A, related to the Arujá Structural High onshore, 

which in combination with other NW-SE-oriented transverse structures of the southwestern 

part of the Taubaté Basin (lineament C, Figure 25). A wide shallow region is observed in the 

coastal region adjoining the Taubaté Basin. The zone of separation between the Taubaté and 

Resende basins shows at that time a clear prolongation along a WNW-ESE-oriented shallow 

region (lineament D, Figure 25).

The isopach map of Figure 26 corresponds to the time-interval between the Miocene 

and the Recent. This time-interval encompasses three deformational events in the Taubaté and 

Resende basins. The influence of lineament A, as well as the shallow coastal region in front of 

Taubaté Basin remained. NW-SE-oriented structures, as those observed in Taubaté Basin 

seem to have influenced the depocenter control in the adjoining region in the Santos Basin.

5. DISCUSSION 

5.1 Seismic interpretation 

The seismic profile 225-0061 (Figure 6) crosses the Eugênio de Melo Sub-basin 

(Marques 1990), with the Caçapava Structural High to the west where Precambrian basement 

rocks crops out. According to Riccomini (1989) this high is strongly conditioned by NNE-

oriented faults generated and reactivated during the NW-SE-oriented compressive 

deformation event that occurred during the Late Pleistocene to Holocene. Using gravimetric 

data, Fernandes and Chang (2002) modeled the Caçapava High as a non-exposed alkaline 

body, which might be interfering in deformational processes that originated the basins of the 

CRSB. This alkaline body could be acted as a discontinuity that allowed its permanence as a 

high during the rift opening. 

Some authors have considered an onlap contact between the basement and the Unit B 

and the Resende Formation, concluding that the highs are active during the sedimentation 

(Marques, 1990; Cogné et al., 2013), especially in the Caçapava High. Nonetheless, the onlap 

contact on the west side of the profile is dubious. There is a possibility that the high was 

formed during a deformational event, corroborated by the edge faults and the deformation of 

the sedimentary pack that become progressively steep as it nears to the structural high. Thus, 

the contact between the sedimentary pile and the basement may demonstrate that not all highs 

were formed by deformation events, and some of them were active during the sedimentation. 

This seismic profile shows that the basement presents reverse and normal faults, but the 

structure like folds in the basement were considered an artifact related to multiple reflections 

as the basement is composed of Neoproterozoic crystalline rocks (granitoids, gneisses, and 

migmatites). These rocks are expected to be in ductile state to fold, which is not this case. 

Moreover, folds in crystalline rocks have a difficult interpretation on seismic profiles due the 



 

 

inability of the current techniques to account for lateral variations in velocity and to display 

steeply dipping reflectors (Ji and Long, 2006). 

The seismic profile 225-0064 (Figure 8) crosses the Capela do Socorro (Marques, 1990) 

or Pindamonhangaba Structural High (Fernandes, 1993), separating the Quiririm and Roseira 

depocenters. The sedimentary rocks are mainly deformed over the structural high, but the 

contacts between them appear to remain near horizontal, which may indicate that the sediment 

was already deposited when the high was active. The transverse folds in Tremembé 

Formation described by Riccomini (1989), Takiya et al. (1990) and Silva (2007) are located 

in the area near this high. The deformation created by the reactivation of this high may have 

produced folding in shale of the Tremembé Formation during the NE-SW-oriented 

compressional event of a probable Miocene age (Riccomini et al., 2004).  

The seismic profiles 225-0065 and 225-0063 (Figures 9 and 10) crosses the Roseira 

depocenter, the only sub-basin with Unit A, the oldest in the Taubaté Basin. The presence of a 

seismic unit exclusively in the Roseira Sub-basin as well as the contact relationship between 

the sedimentary pack and the basement in some structural highs might demonstrate that the 

initial rift opening would had occurred in segments, as in the conceptual models presented by 

Gawthorpe and Leeder (2000). The process of fault propagation, growth and death mainly 

controls the basin architecture. Thus, basin linkage by burial or breaching of the relays and 

crossover basement ridges is the dominant mechanism whereby hydrologically closed rifts 

evolve into open ones (Gawthorpe and Leeder, 2000). 

According to Riccomini et al. (2004) there are two anticlines in the area, one is the 

Caçapava Structural High, trending NE-SW and the other is the Pindamonhangaba Structural 

High trending NW-SE. The conceptual model described by Gawthorpe and Leeder (2000) 



 

 

foresee the presence of transverse anticlines in the hangingwall of normal faults, associated 

with minimum displacement at segment boundaries. 

Furthermore, the presence of a pre-existing structural fabric influences the structural 

development of the rift system. In extensional settings influenced by a pre-existent structural 

fabric the mode of fault growth may differ from established fault grown models (Whipp et al., 

2014). 

The Taubaté Basin had inherited a previously basement discontinuity from the Ribeira 

Belt and related shear zones. This fact may have propitiated a quick opening of the rift, 

considering that only Unit A is missing from other seismic profiles. In consequence, it is not 

necessary to claim a transcurrence to explain the RCSB opening. The existence of active 

structural highs and exclusive sedimentary packs in one sub-basin would be related to border 

fault grown, in an extensional regime. The Figure 27 illustrate conceptual model of 

Gawthorpe and Leeder (2000). 

 

Figure 27 - Schematic 3D evolution of a normal fault array (adapted from Gawthorpe &amp;amp; Leeder, 2000). 

Considering this model for Taubaté Basin it is possible to explain the existence of only 

one sub-basin nestling the seismic Unit A. Consequently, this segment was the first to form 

and was delimited by the Pindamonhangaba High, as an anticline. Afterwards the other 

segments were formed and linked, maintaining the structural highs active, as the Caçapava 

High. 

 



 

 

5.2 Structural analysis 

The Continental Rift of Southeastern Brasil has a polyphasic tectonic evolution. After 

an initial extensional phase with NNW-SSE-oriented extension, four deformational phases 

involving reactivations along previous faults and subordinately the formation of new ones are 

recognized (Riccomini, 1989; Riccomini et al., 2004): a) a strike-slip regime, with NW-SE-

oriented extension and local NE-SW-oriented compression, active during the Neogene 

(Miocene); b) a NW-SE-oriented Late Pleistocene to Holocene compressive stress regime 

followed; c) an E-W- to NW-SE-oriented Holocene extension; d) and an E-W-oriented 

compression. There are transverse structures in Taubaté and Resende basins related to the 

generation and deformation of the CRSB. 

Transverse structures related to the NW-SE-oriented extension (Eocene - Oligocene) are 

represented by syn-sedimentary normal faults (sites T-12 and T-13). Paleostress analysis of 

these faults indicates a general extensional field trending NE-SW, with a vertical 

compressional field. The direction of extension is at low angle with the direction of the master 

fault in both sites, located in the northern border of the basins. This result is apparently 

incompatible with the initial stress field related to the rift opening, identified as an extensional 

field trending NW-SE (v.g. Riccomini et al., 2004). The studied section in the Resende Basin 

corresponds to the upper part of the Taubaté Group suggesting that this extension has 

occurred in a final stage of rift phase. 

Based on stress ellipsoids and their relationship with the formation of structures, in an 

extensional regime it is expected that normal faults would be created perpendicularly to ?3 

(direction of maximum extension). Nonetheless, according to Gibbs (1984, 1990) graben 

usually shows fault trends at a high angle to the margins, as transverse faults, and in some 

cases these have been interpreted as later faults. These faults are related to the normal faults 



 

 

formation and where called as transfer faults. They allow the escape of tension between 

extension faults with different slip rates. The main characteristic of these faults is the strike-

slip movement and the connection with two distinct normal faults. 

Destro (1995) and Destro et al. (2003), based on outcrop and seismic data in the 

Sergipe-Alagoas Basin, suggested a new type of cross-fault, denominated release fault. 

Release faults are geometrically required to accommodate variable displacement along the 

strike of a normal fault as a result of the increase in length of the hangingwall by bending or 

flexure in the strike direction. They are a type of cross faults and do not cut normal fault 

planes nor detachment surfaces at depth. Other important characteristic is the type of 

movement that seems normal without implying in extension along the strike of the basin. 

Regarding the deformation, release faulting is associated with plane strain deformation in 

linked extensional fault system (Destro, 1995). Therefore, it is possible to relate transverse 

faults to an extensional regime, and these faults might be transfer or release faults. 

Moreover, according to Destro et al. (2003) the release-faulting model predicts that 

local paleostress field can strongly diverge from regional one. The stress ellipsoid in the 

footwall of the normal fault reproduces the regional stresses, where the maximum principal 

stress (?1) is vertical, and the minimum principal stress (?3) is parallel to the extension 

direction. In release faults, which behave as normal faults, and in release fractures the 

intermediate principal stress (?2) and the minimum principal stress (?3) switch positions and 

the maximum principal stress (?1) remains vertical (Figure 28). 

 



 

 

 

Figure 28 - Conceptual model of stress field in normal and release faults. A) Regional paleostress field; B) Role 
swap between ?2 and ?3, causing the formation of release faults. C) Perpendicularly to ?3, release fractures may 
develop parallel to release faults. D) Reversion among the three principal stresses, forming a reverse fault 
(adapted from Destro et al., 2003) 

In the conceptual model of release faults formation is admitted the development of 

reverse faults locally. Where the downslip is great, compression might occur in the hanging 

wall, swapping ?1 by ?3. In this case, ?3 becomes vertical and ?1 parallel to the strike of 

parent fault (Destro et al., 2003). 

Syn-sedimentary normal faults at the northern borders of the Resende and Taubaté 

basins are related to master faults and apparently do not intercept nor connect different normal 

faults. Furthermore, they tend to be oblique to nearly perpendicular to the strike of main 

faults. The swapping between ?2 and ?3, considering the regional stress field, is also an 

important indication that the normal faults described in sites T-12 and T-13 might be 

considered as release faults, and they are compatible with the regional paleostress field. 

Transverse structures related to NE-SW-oriented compression and NW-SE-oriented 

extension (Miocene) comprise faults and folds. Faults are in part syn-sedimentary in relation 

to the Itaquaquecetuba Formation. Non-cylindrical, NW-SE-oriented folds in lacustrine shale 

of Tremembé Formation in the central part of the Taubaté basin are recognized in outcrop 

(Riccomini, 1989) and regional map scale (Takiya et al., 1990; Silva, 2007). According to 



 

 

Silva (2007), these folds present en echelon pattern, both in outcrop and map scale. Fluvial 

deposits of Pindamonhangaba Formation overlying lacustrine shales are unfolded and 

separated by an unconformity (Riccomini, 1989). Gawthorpe and Leeder (2000) and Destro et 

al. (2003) proposed models that predict transverse syn-rift structures formed by a local 

compression, as folds and reverse faults, respectively. Schlische (1995) pointed that 

synfolding sedimentary deposits, formed in an extensional setting, are thicker in the hinges of 

synclines and thinner in the hinge of anticlines. In the Taubaté case, thickness of Tremembé 

Formation is nearly uniform and folding presents an en echelon array, which is typical of a 

strike-slip deformation (v.g. Harding 1985). Considering the timing of deformation, post-

Tremembé and pre-Pindamonhangaba Formation, and the direction of fold axes, they are 

related to the deformational event with NE-SW-oriented compression, of Miocene age. 

Deformation related to this event was responsible for generation of transverse structural 

highs in the basins. Deposition of the Itaquaquecetuba Formation next to the Arujá Structural 

High was related to this event. The capture of the headwaters of Tietê River by the Paraíba do 

Sul River also occurred during this event and changed the sedimentary supply from Santos to 

Campos Basin (Riccomini et al., 2010). 

The NW-SE-oriented compression and NE-SW-oriented extension (Late Pleistocene – 

Holocene) has generated mainly normal transverse faults with a general NW-SE-orientation 

that affects stone-line and colluvium. Given the subvertical dip of some faults and the 

superposition of striae verified in some cases is likely that they represent reactivations of 

older strike-slip, transverse faults of the first deformational event, which in turn may indicate 

the presence of syn-rift, NW-SE-oriented transfer faults in this region of the Taubaté Basin. 

Transverse faults associated with the E-W- to NW-SE-oriented extension (Holocene) 

have widespread occurrence both in Resende and Taubaté basins. These faults have a general 



 

 

N-S to NNE-WSW-direction and truncate Pindamonhangaba Formation and overlying stone-

line and a sandy colluvium. The presence of negative flower structures in the termination of 

some subvertical normal faults indicate a probable previous strike-slip movement. These data 

are in agreement with Mancini (1995) who pointed the predominance of normal faults, 

trending NNW and NNE in this region. Yet, they indicate a clear dominance of an extensional 

regime during the Holocene in the region of the Caçapava Structural High.  

Transverse faults related to the E-W-oriented compression (current stress-field) are 

scarcely represented in the study area. The most common structural feature related to this 

stress-regime is a widespread set of neotectonic conjugate hybrid and shear joints in colluvial 

and alluvial deposits, mainly in the eastern part of the Taubaté and western part of the 

Resende basins (Salvador, 1994; Salvador and Riccomini, 1995), which corresponds to 

neotectonic joints in the sense of Hancock and Engelder (1989). In the studied cases the 

variable direction and nature of faults indicate that they were generated during previous 

deformational events and reactivated under the E-W-compressional stress-field. This is the 

reason for the high dispersion in the position of striae related to this last deformational event, 

as the faults were reactivated probably in a non-ideal surface 

This E-W-oriented compressional stress field is compatible with the present-day stress-

field (Assumpção, 1992, 1998). The southeastern Brazil is located intraplate, and this type of 

tectonism is related to several mechanisms. According to Assumpção (1992), this 

compression results from a combination of regional stress (which is related to plate boundary 

forces and spreading effects due to continent/oceanic crust transition), local flexural effects 

from thick sedimentary loads (in the passive margin basins as Santos and Campos Basin) and 

a weaker crust from Mesozoic thinning. 

5.3 Isopach maps 



 

 

The Santos Basin constitutes one of the largest marginal depression in the passive 

margin of Brazil (Macedo, 1989). Its adjacent continental area is formed by crustal blocks of 

the Ribeira Belt that were tectonically active during the evolution of the basin. The west limit 

of the Santos Basin comprehends the belt of coastal ranges as Serra do Mar and Serra da 

Mantiqueira, where the basins from the Continental Rift of Southeastern Brazil were installed. 

The continental area adjacent to the Santos, Campos and Espírito Santo basins is 

characterized by a high topography, with elevations reaching up to 2000 m (Mohriak et al., 

2008). The origin of this mountain range has been considered as related to the retreat of the 

uplifted margin from Cretaceous until present (Gallagher et al. 1994; Almeida and Carneiro, 

1998), secondary flexural bulge generated during rifting that persisted to the present day 

(Sacek et al., 2012), or rejuvenation of the topography by Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic 

uplift (Hiruma et al., 2010; Cogné et al., 2011, 2012; Franco-Magalhães et al., 2014). 

Following continental break-up the continental margin did not behave as a typical passive 

margin, and a series of Paleogene basins were installed near the continental margin, along the 

Serra do Mar and Serra da Mantiqueira.  

Throughout the geological evolution of Santos Basin, the basin fill was altered by the 

tectonic events to which the continent and continental margins were subjected. During the 

Upper Cretaceous, strong sedimentary pulses in the Santos Basin were correlated to 

expressive uplifts in the continental area, being associated with plutonic alkaline magmatism 

as registered in the Itatiaia Massif. Later, during the Neogene, the sedimentation of the Santos 

Basin became fine-grained and with a minor significance caused by the headwater capture of 

Tietê River, thus the coarse sediments were transported by the Paraíba do Sul River that 

debouch in the area of the Campos Basin (Macedo, 1989).  



 

 

Therefore it is possible to connect the Cenozoic tectonics and sedimentation of the 

Santos Basin with the formation and evolution of Taubaté and Resende basins.  

Asmus and Ferrari (1978), Kumar and Gamboa (1979) and Macedo (1989) proposed 

that some offshore transfer faults would have a continuity towards the continent, as the 

Transfer Zones of Florianópolis and Curitiba. According to Macedo (1989) these transfer 

zones have an important role in the oil industry, with the major occurrences of oil in the 

Santos Basin located nearby the transfer zones. Souza et al. (2009), using STRM digital 

elevation models, identified transverse or sub-transverse structures to the coast, with NW-SE 

direction, in the Precambrian basement of coastal area of southeastern Brazil. Based on 

seismic profiles, these structures were related to faults and to the evolution and deformation of 

the north portion of the Santos Basin. 

This linkage between onshore and offshore faults was also pointed in Campos Basin 

(Lourenço et al. 2014) based on interpretation of high-resolution airborne magnetic data. 

These faults have the same NW-SE-direction indicated by Souza et al. (2009) in the Santos 

Basin. The faults mapped in the Campos Basin were related to structures in the Barra de São 

João Graben, a basin of the Continental Rift of Southeastern Brazil located in the Rio de 

Janeiro state (Lourenço et al. 2014). 

Based on the interpretation of the transverse structures in seismic profiles, Souza et al. 

(2009) recognized four deformational events that affected the Santos Basin. The last two 

events are related to the formation and deformation of the basins of the Continental Rift of 

Southeastern Brazil. During the Paleocene, in seismic profiles, were identified normal, reverse 

and transfer faults sectioning the Eocene section in the Santos Basin. The last phase is 

associated with neotectonic events, with faults intercepting the Miocene section. The transfer 



 

 

faults were correlated by Souza et al. (2009) with transverse structures in the São Paulo, 

Taubaté, Resende basins as well as with structural highs inside and separating these basins. 

During the rift opening, the CRSB was under a NW-SE- to NNW-SSE-oriented 

extension, generating normal faults trending E-W to ENE-WNW. As explained previously 

there are two types of transverse faults that are related to extensional regime: transfer faults 

(Gibbs 1984, 1990) and release faults (Destro, 1998 and Destro et al. 2003). The main 

difference between transfer and release faults are the movement (strike-slip or normal dip-

slip) and the linkage between normal fault planes (only transfer faults connect two or more 

faults). Among the structural data, there were one fault set related to release faults, but the 

sedimentary register of transverse faults associated to the initial extensional stress-field is 

scarce.  

The alignment of depocenters in Santos Basin would be a repercussion of the NW-SE-

oriented extensional field. Two transverse structures have a probable link between the Santos 

Basin and the central segment of the CRSB, the lineaments A (the continuity of the Arujá 

Structural High) and B (the prolongation of the Queluz Structural High) (Figure 24). These 

structures are probable transfer zones in the Santos Basin, as they imposed a seesaw 

movement in the basin, with depocenter between A and B lineaments displacing 

northwestwards in relation to depocenters to the SW and NW.  

In the Lower Miocene the left-lateral transcurrence, with a compression trending NW-

SE, promoted an important change in the Taubaté Basin. The previous pattern was altered by 

the formation of structural highs that segmented the rift. One of these highs changed the 

drainage, with the capture of the Tietê River headwater by the Paraíba do Sul River. 

Moreover, the blocks in the Taubaté Basin tilted as a seesaw.  



 

 

As shown in the isopach map of Upper Miocene to Lower Miocene time-interval 

(Figure 25), lineaments A and C (Figure 25) seem to configure a major transfer zone limiting 

shallow areas of the basement in the Santos Basin to NW and SE, respectively to the N and S 

of this zone. The shallow region along the coastal region adjoining the Taubaté Basin may 

suggest that, together with this segment of the Serra do Mar, the entire region experienced 

uplift. The continuity of a WNW-ESE-oriented fault zone offshore (lineament D, Figure 25) 

probably represents a relay ramp zone in Santos Basin. This zone is probably exposed 

onshore along the WNW-ESE-oriented Funil Fault Zone (Riccomini, 1989) and the faults in 

the Itatiaia alkaline Massif, of the same orientation (Figure, 15). 

According to Assine et al. (2008), after the Miocene the region was marked by eustatic 

fluctuations related to global cycles of glaciation. The time-interval between the Late 

Pleistocene and the Recent comprises three deformational events in the central segment of the 

CRSB. The isopach map of Miocene to Recent (Figure 26) evince that Lineament A was still 

active at that time and probably some transverse structures played some role on the control of 

depocenters in the Santos Basin. 

It seems clear that only the NW-SE-oriented structures exerted influence in the Santos 

Basin during its Cenozoic evolution. These structures were active predominantly as transfer 

faults that have divided the basin in compartments. In particular, lineament A, which 

corresponds to the extent offshore of the Arujá Structural High, seems to have had a long-

lived, multiphase activity during the Cenozoic. Major oil fields in the Santos Basin are 

localized in the region adjoining the Taubaté and Resende basins, roughly between NW-SE-

oriented lineaments A and B. This fact would suggest that these structures together other NW-

SE-oriented faults and folds may have influenced, respectively, the migration routes and 

structural traps in the Santos Basin. 



 

 

 

6. CONCLUSIONS 

The main focus of this paper was the study of the transverse structures in the Taubaté 

and Resende basins focusing on their nature, geometry, kinematics, relationships with 

sedimentation, age, the stress field active during their generation and deformation, and 

regional correlations. Besides, the possible physical continuity of these structures and/or the 

action of stress fields related to them into the Santos Basin and the implications for the 

tectonic framework and evolution of this basin were also analyzed. The key conclusion of this 

study are as follow: 

a) transverse faults in longitudinal seismic profiles are usually steep, with normal, reverse and 

strike-slip character; all the seismic units are deformed by faults, including the younger 

sedimentary packs, but all faults were identified as pre and post-sedimentary; 

b) structural highs were identified in seismic profiles, some of them active during the 

installation of the Taubaté Basin; 

c) the existence of active structural highs and exclusive sedimentary packs in one sub-basin 

would be related to border fault grown, in an extensional regime 

d) fault-slip data inversion and paleostress determination allowed to identify that there are 

transverse structures related to the five tectonic events previously reported to the central 

segment of the CRSB; 

e) transverse structures related to the initial NW-SE-oriented extensional event (Eocene - 

Oligocene) are represented by syn-sedimentary normal faults related to master faults and 

apparently not intercepting nor connecting different normal faults; these faults indicate a 

general extensional field trending NE-SW, which allowed to classify them as release faults; 



 

 

f) transverse faults associated with the NE-SW-oriented compression and NW-SE-oriented 

extension (Miocene) are in part syn-sedimentary in relation to the Itaquaquecetuba Formation; 

the nearly uniform thickness of folded layers of Tremembé Formation associated with their en 

echelon array, indicate that they are related to the deformational event with NE-SW-oriented 

compression; 

g) transverse faults related to the NW-SE-oriented compression and NE-SW-oriented 

extension (Late Pleistocene – Holocene) are mainly normal, with a general NW-SE-

orientation, affecting stone-line and colluvium; some of these faults with subvertical dip and 

showing superposition of striae probably represent reactivations of older strike-slip, transverse 

faults; 

h) the E-W- to NW-SE-oriented extension (Holocene) has generated transverse faults with a 

general N-S- to NNE-WSW-direction that truncate the Pindamonhangaba Formation and 

overlying stone-line and a sandy colluvium;  

i) a few faults related to the E-W-oriented compression (current stress-field) were recognized 

in the study area; the variable direction and nature of faults indicate that they were generated 

during previous deformational events and reactivated, thus showing high dispersion in the 

position of striae related to this last deformational event as the faults were reactivated along 

non-ideal previous fault surfaces; 

j) only the NW-SE-oriented structures exerted influence in the Santos Basin during its 

Cenozoic evolution; five lineaments with this direction were recognized in isopach maps, 

showing a probable continuity offshore and controlling depocenters in the Santos Basin: the 

lineaments A (the continuity of the Arujá Structural High) and B (the prolongation of the 

Queluz Structural High), during the Paleocene-Oligocene; lineaments A, C and lineament D, 

during the Miocene; and lineaments A and E during the Late-Pleistocene to Recent. 



 

 

h) these structures were active predominantly as transfer faults, which have divided the basin 

in compartments; in particular, lineament A, corresponding to the extent offshore of the Arujá 

Structural High, seems to have had a long-lived, multiphase activity during the Cenozoic; 

i) major oil fields in the Santos Basin are localized in the region adjoining the Taubaté and 

Resende basins, roughly between NW-SE-oriented lineaments A and B, which would suggest 

the combined influence of these structures together other NW-SE-oriented faults and folds in 

the migration routes and formation of structural traps in the Santos Basin.
