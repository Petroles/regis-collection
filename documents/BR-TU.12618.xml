resumo 
 
 

O objectivo deste trabalho centrou-se na análise das distribuições de 
densidade em células neuronais de retinas de mictofídeos e na relação com 
parâmetros ecológicos e comportamentais. Retinal wholemounting technique 
permitiu a determinação de densidades topográficas de fotoreceptores (PRs), 
células ganglionares da retina (RGCs) e células amácrinas (ACs) em 
mictofídeos adultos. Estes dados possibilitam a identificação de 
especializações retinais e desenvolver estimativas de acuidade e sensibilidade 
visual, assim como sensibilidade à luz de origem bioluminescente ou solar. As 
sete espécies de mictofídeos analisadas apresentam elevada densidade de 
PRs e baixas densidades de RGCs. Especializações retinais divergentes 
reflectem diferenças comportamentais entre espécies de mictofídeos. Os 
parâmetros visuais são influenciados essencialmente por factores ecológicos, 
mas as relações filogenéticas são também um factor que poderá explicar os 
padrões de distribuição de células retinais em mictofídeos. Concluindo, as 
espécies estudadas revelam elevada sensibilidade visual e baixa acuidade, 
sugerindo uma grande adaptação às condições de luminosidade da zona 
mesopelágica.

abstract 
 

This work aims to analyse the density and distribution of neuron cells on retinae 
of myctophid fishes in relation to ecological and behavioural parameters. 
Retinal wholemounting technique allowed the observation of topographic 
densities for photoreceptors (PRs), retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and amacrine 
cells (ACs) in adult myctophids. These data allowed the identification of retinal 
specializations and the estimation of visual acuity and sensitivity, and sensitivity 
to bioluminescence flashes and to downwelling light. The seven analysed 
myctophid species showed high density of PRs and low density for RGCs. 
Different retinal specializations reflect behavioural differences between 
myctophid species. Visual parameters are influenced mainly by ecological 
factors, but phylogenetic relationships are also a factor that may explain the 
distribution of retinal cells in myctophids. In conclusion, all species in this study 
showed high visual sensitivity and low acuity, suggesting a great adaptation to 
mesopelagic light conditions.

1. Introduction 

The mesopelagic zone is the region in the water column between 200 and 1000 m depth, defined 

as the oceanic layer where sunlight penetration is insufficient for photosynthesis but allows the 

fauna to differentiate between day and night (Douglas et al., 1995; Turner et al., 2009; Robinson et 

al., 2010; Sutton, 2013). Known also as dysphotic or twilight zone, the mesopelagic layer 

represents the transition from the upwards epipelagic photic zone to the aphotic downwards 

bathypelagic zone (Salvanes &amp;amp; Kristoffersen, 2001; Robinson et al., 2010; Sutton, 2013). Although 

biophysical conditions become more stable over time and space in the mesopelagic zone, it 

presents a gradient in environmental parameters (Robinson et al., 2010; Sutton, 2013). 

Environmental conditions at mesopelagic depths are very particular, showing mainly dim light, 

cold waters with oxygen minimum levels, reduced turbulence, increased hydrostatic pressure, high 

inorganic nutrient concentrations and irregular food supply (Robinson et al., 2010; Catul et al., 

2011). Mesopelagic zone may be split at 600-700 m depth as upper and lower mesopelagic 

(Warrant &amp;amp; Locket, 2004; Sutton, 2013). The upper mesopelagic is illuminated essentially by 

downwelling sunlight and its incidence on objects creates extended light scenes whilst lower 

mesopelagic is dominated by bioluminescent flashes, representing a different light scene with point 

source light (Wagner et al., 1998; Warrant &amp;amp; Locket, 2004; Yakir et al., 2013). The adaptation of 

deep-sea fishes to one or both light conditions varies interspecifically, depending on ecological 

drivers, environment (changing nature of visual scenes), and species-specific ecological traits 

(natural histories) (Warrant &amp;amp; Locket, 2004).  Camouflage strategies change through the 

mesopelagic zone in relation to light source types and regimes. At the upper mesopelagic zone, 

fishes generally present silver coloration and large photophores, as an adaptation for predator 

avoidance in dim light, whilst at the lower mesopelagic zone, where light penetration is diminished, 

fishes are dark-coloured, from black to crimson (Warrant &amp;amp; Locket, 2004; Catul et al., 2011; 

Sutton, 2013).  

At mesopelagic depths, sources of the available monochromatic and dim light (Fig. 1) are 

downwelling sunlight and bioluminescence (Douglas et al., 1995; Haddock et al., 2010; Johnsen, 

2005; Lythgoe &amp;amp; Partridge, 1989). The downwelling light available corresponds only to a narrow 

blue-green bandwidth, with wavelength between 470-490 nm (Douglas et al., 1995; Turner et al., 

2009).

Considering that about 80% of the deep-sea species are bioluminescent and the sunlight is 

scarcely penetrating down to these depths, bioluminescence is the most important light source to 

animals living in mesopelagic and deeper depths (Douglas et al., 1995; Douglas et al., 1998; 

Turner et al., 2009; Sutton, 2013). Bioluminescence light presents spectral emission maxima 

(?Imax) of 450-520 nm (Partridge et al., 1989; Turner et al., 2009). Biological light production by 

mesopelagic fishes is used, for instance, for intraspecific identification and communication and 

interspecific purposes - attraction and identification of prey (Turner et al., 2009; Haddock et al., 

2010). Bioluminescence is widely used for camouflage functions, mostly for counterillumination, 

where for instance prey’s ventral photophores match the downwelling light disrupting their 

silhouettes for the downside viewer, the predator with monochromatic retinas (Cocker, 1978; 

Johnsen et al., 2004; Turner et al., 2009; Haddock et al., 2010). Other examples of the biological 

produced light function include lures to illuminate prey (e.g. the barbell of stomiids), luminous 

flashes, and smokescreen to startle or confuse predators (e.g., squids and crustaceans) (Cocker, 

1978; Haddock et al., 2010). 

Mesopelagic conditions influence distribution and behaviour of fauna, with remarkable 

behavioural, physiological and morphological adaptations (Robinson et al., 2010; Catul et al., 2011; 

Sutton, 2013). At these depths many animals retreat during daytime from visual predators (“anti-

predator-window”), as many species, mostly from the upper mesopelagic zone, perform diel 

vertical migrations (DVM) (Salvanes &amp;amp; Kristoffersen, 2001; Robinson et al., 2010; Sutton, 2013).

DVM behaviour aims at feeding during the night at shallower depths while staying in relative 

inactivity at mesopelagic depths during daytime (Robinson et al., 2010; Sutton, 2013). DVM is a 

crucial process for energy exchange between lower and higher trophic levels and it also has an 

important contribution for the biological pump of organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus at 

deeper waters (Bergstad et al., 2003; Robinson et al., 2010). Over 90% of the organic carbon is 

vertically exported from epipelagic and turned back into carbon dioxide by mesopelagic 

communities from respiration, faecal pellets, predation and dissolved organic matter (Robinson et 

al., 2010).  

As a dim scene of light changing conditions, essentially for DVM species, mesopelagic zone is 

a habitat where species with the most remarkable visual adaptations are found. Light sensitivity is 

crucial to fishes for DVM both for perceiving bioluminescent signals and for matching its own 

counterillumination to downwelling light (Robinson et al. 2010).  

 

1.1. Vision of deep-sea fishes 

In an environment where light has such an important ecological role, mesopelagic fishes rely 

mainly on the sense of vision (Cocker, 1978). In fact, mesopelagic fishes have an optic tectum 

more developed than other sensorial brain parts (Collin et al., 2000; Salvanes &amp;amp; Kristoffersen, 

2001; Wagner, 2002), and in some cases (e.g. myctophids) the pineal organ presents an extraocular 

photoreceptor and is able to discriminate slow environmental light shifts (Young et al., 1979; 

Bowmaker &amp;amp; Wagner, 2004). Also, deep-sea fishes may be able to detect dim sunlight down to 

1150 m depth (Denton &amp;amp; Warren, 1957). These fishes evolved in order to exceptionally adapt to 

the extreme environmental conditions, by developing sensitive monochromatic vision at dim light 

(O’Day &amp;amp; Fernandez, 1976; Pankhurst, 1987; Yokoyama &amp;amp; Yokoyama, 1996). The main ocular 

adaptations are: large eyes and pupils, with aphakic gap (Yokoyama &amp;amp; Yokoyama, 1996; Warrant 

&amp;amp; Locket, 2004; Turner et al., 2009; de Busserolles et al, 2014); shortwave lens (Douglas et al., 

1995; Douglas et al., 1998); fovea (Wagner et al., 1998; Warrant &amp;amp; Locket, 2004); tapetum 

lucidum (O’Day &amp;amp; Fernandez, 1976; Pankhurst, 1987; de Busserolles et al., 2014); multiple banks 

arrangement of the retina (Pankhurst, 1987; Wagner, 2002); pure-rod retina (O’Day &amp;amp; Fernandez, 

1976; Pankhurst, 1987; de Busseroles et al., 2014); high density of large photoreceptor cells 

(Denton &amp;amp; Warren, 1957; Pankhurst, 1987; Hope et al., 1997; Hunt et al., 2001; Sabatés et al., 

2003); high photoreceptors-ganglion cells convergence ratio (McNulty, 1976; Locket, 1980; 

Wagner, 2002); large-sized retinal photoreceptor outer segments (Pankhurst, 1987; Partridge et al., 

1989); and high concentration of single pigmented rhodopsin (O’Day &amp;amp; Fernandez, 1976; Cocker, 

1978; Partridge et al., 1989; Hope et al., 1997; Hunt et al., 2001).

Larger eyes present larger pupils allowing maximization of light entering the eye and, 

consequently long visual range, higher visual sensitivity and acuity (Douglas et al., 1998; Warrant 

&amp;amp; Locket, 2004).  

The aphakic gap is an “extension” of the pupil located between the lens and the iris, permitting 

the entrance of light from oblique angles without passing through the lens (Warrant &amp;amp; Locket, 2004; 

de Busserolles, 2013). Therefore, aphakic gaps allow higher visual sensitivity in detriment of acuity 

(Douglas et al., 1998; Warrant &amp;amp; Locket, 2004; de Busserolles, 2013). Two types of aphakic gaps 

are classified: rostral and circumlental. Rostral aphakic gaps focus frontal light on the temporal part 

of the retina, enhancing light projection onto this area, while the circumlental aphakic gap 

surrounds the entire lens, increasing light entrance from all directions (Warrant &amp;amp; Locket, 2004; de 

Busserolles, 2013).  

Lenses are transparent structures, which grow continually through life, and refract the incident 

light, focusing an image on the retina (Douglas et al., 1998; Warrant &amp;amp; Locket, 2004). It allows 

greater visual acuity proportionally to the lens size, as focal length enhances with lenses’ diameter 

(Collin &amp;amp; Pettigrew, 1989; Warrant &amp;amp; Locket, 2004).  

Light enters the eye (Fig. 2A) through the pupil (conditioned by the aphakic gap, when present), 

refracted by the lens and focused on the retina (Warrant &amp;amp; Locket, 2004; de Busserolles, 2013). 

The retina receives the light of the surroundings and sends it through the optical nerve, as an 

electric signal to the animal’s brain (Collin &amp;amp; Pettigrew, 1989; Wagner et al., 1998; Warrant &amp;amp; 

Locket, 2004; de Busserolles, 2013). The retina is a thin multi-layered tissue composed by different 

types of neurons (Fig. 2B) (O’Day &amp;amp; Fernandez, 1976; Wagner et al., 1998; de Busserolles, 2013). 

The retina’s outer side (scleral) is composed by visual cells (photoreceptors (PRs)) that receive and 

translate the light information into an electrical signal (Wagner et al., 1998; Ullmann et al., 2011; 

de Busserolles, 2013). This electric impulse is transmitted synaptically through multi-layered 

interneurons (plexiform layer) to the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) on the inner (vitreal) side 

(Wagner et al., 1998; de Busserolles, 2013). 

Among different types of interneurons are the amacrine cells (ACs, Fig. 2D), regulating the 

information from the interneurons to the RGCs. Teleosts possess around 40 types of ACs, many of 

them with specific functions still unknown (Wagner et al., 1998; de Busserolles, 2013). Unlike 

from the other neuronal cells, RGCs (Fig. 2D) possesses axons composing the optic nerve, which 

are responsible to link the eyes to the brain, sending the electric signals with the perceived 

environment to the visual centres of the brain, where the electric impulses are interpreted as images 

(Wagner et al., 1998; Collin et al., 2000; Warrant &amp;amp; Locket, 2004; de Busserolles, 2013). As the 

fish grows, the retinal growing is accompanied by an increase of RGCs number, but the densities 



8 

 
 

 

 

 

tend to decrease (Pankhurst, 1987; Collin &amp;amp; Pettigrew, 1989). Different types of RGCs are 

specialised for different characteristics of the perceived image (e.g. colour, movement, and contrast) 

and processed by different brain areas (Wagner et al., 1998; de Busserolles, 2013).

Photoreceptors are divided in two types: rods and cones (Fig. 2B) (Yokoyama &amp;amp; Yokoyama, 

1996; Warrant &amp;amp; Locket, 2004; de Busserolles, 2013). Cones are linked to acute and coloured 

vision, and rods to light sensitivity, as they are hundred times more sensitive to light than cones 

(Partridge et al., 1988; Lythgoe &amp;amp; Partridge, 1989; Partridge et al., 1989; Yokoyama &amp;amp; Yokoyama, 

1996; Douglas et al., 1998). Deep-sea fishes possess mostly pure-rod retinas (Fig. 2C) (Munk, 

1977; Cocker, 1978; Lythgoe &amp;amp; Partridge, 1989). As rods detect a narrow interval of shortwaves 

they are linked to scotopic (nocturnal) monochromatic vision (Pankhurst, 1987; Partridge et al., 



9 

 
 

 

 

 

1989; Yokoyama &amp;amp; Yokoyama, 1996; Warrant &amp;amp; Locket, 2004; Johnsen, 2005). The diameter of 

rods’ outer segments are intra- and interspecific variable (Partridge et al., 1988; Partridge et al., 

1989) and cell densities are constant or increase with fish age, as they have in situ origin from 

precursor cells mitosis (Locket, 1980). Multiple banks are photoreceptors arranged in multilayers, 

which may increase as the fish grows and photoreceptors may cover totally the retinal surface with 

visual pigment (Locket, 1980; Somiya, 1982).  

The photoreceptors’ outer segments (Fig. 2B) include the visual pigments, transforming the 

energy of the received photons into electrical signals (hyperpolarisation/transduction) and are 

responsible for visual sensitivity - retinal pigment maximum wavelength (?max) absorption  

(Douglas et al., 1995; Turner et al., 2009; de Busserolles, 2013). These pigments are proteins – 

opsins – covalently bonded to a light absorbing chromophore, derived from vitamin A (Bowmaker 

et al., 1988; Yokoyama &amp;amp; Yokoyama, 1996; Hope et al., 1997; Hasegawa et al., 2008; Toyama et 

al., 2008). Most deep-sea fishes present rhodopsin, a pigment derived from vitamin A1, but some 

possess a chromophore derived from vitamin A2 (porphyropsin), which is more sensitive to longer 

wavelengths (Lythgoe &amp;amp; Partridge, 1989; Hasegawa et al., 2008; Toyama et al., 2008). Visual 

pigment is “tuned” by opsin, a chromophore and its interactions (Yokoyama &amp;amp; Yokoyama, 1996). 

Spectral information depends on the wavelengths of the photons reaching the photoreceptors and 

its retinal pigments (Denton et al., 1985; Bowmaker et al., 1988; Lythgoe &amp;amp; Partridge, 1989; 

Douglas et al., 1998). Deep-sea fishes present mainly single pigmented rhodopsin retinas  as its 

?max (470 - 500 nm) matches mesopelagic shortwave spectra (Denton &amp;amp; Warren, 1957; Lythgoe &amp;amp; 

Partridge, 1989; Douglas et al., 1998; Warrant &amp;amp; Locket, 2004). These shortwave pigments ?max 

are an adaptation to maximise signal, contrast and photon reception, and to reduce noise (Denton &amp;amp; 

Warren, 1957; Lythgoe &amp;amp; Partridge, 1989; Hope et al., 1997; Douglas et al., 1998).  The pattern of 

amino acid residues of the opsin is responsible for the sensitivity of deep-sea fishes’ rhodopsin to 

the dim light environment (Crescitelli et al., 1985; Hope et al., 1997; Douglas et al., 1998). On the 

other hand, Douglas et al. (1998) and Owens et al. (2012) suggest that deep-sea fishes show ?max 

phylogenetic conservatism along with the effect of ecological pressures, for instance, myctophid 

species have similar ?max despite inhabiting diverse depths and not all performing DVMs. Even so, 

these visual pigments and photoreceptors present in deep-sea fishes are an adaptation to light 

availability. Additionally, recent studies pointed to greater sensitivity to bioluminescence rather 

than to the downwelling light (Douglas et al., 1995; Douglas et al., 1998; Turner et al., 2009). 

Fish retinas grow through life, adding new cells at the periphery, and therefore forcing the older 

cells towards the central area, but, as RGCs density decreases, retinal area for each cell information 

should increase with growth in order to keep a constant receptive field of constant visual angle 



10 

 
 

 

 

 

(Collin &amp;amp; Pettigrew, 1989). Retinal cells densities are not constant throughout the retina. In fact, 

cell topographic distributions reflect the animal’s symmetry of the perceived environment (de 

Busserolles, 2013). The patterns of retinal cells reveal two main visual specializations (Fig. 3): area 

and horizontal streak (Collin &amp;amp; Pettigrew, 1989; Collin et al., 2000; de Busserolles, 2013). The 

area reflects concentric increases of cell densities and is linked to visual acuity in enclosed 

environments (Collin &amp;amp; Pettigrew, 1989; Collin et al., 2000; de Busserolles, 2013).  Horizontal 

streaks represent elongated zones of high cell density, allowing a panoramic perception, more 

common in open water species (Collin &amp;amp; Pettigrew, 1989; Collin et al., 2000; de Busserolles, 

2013). Many open water teleosts present both visual specializations, a temporal area centralis 

probably used during feeding and a horizontal streak to detect intra- or interspecific movements 

(Collin &amp;amp; Pettigrew, 1989; de Busserolles, 2013).

Busserolles (2013).  

 

RGCs and PRs peak densities allow determining the visual sensitivity and acuity, defining light 

sensitivity and image quality, respectively. Peak cell densities can be as high as 7.4 x 10

  in PRs (Wagner et al., 1998; de Busserolles, 2013).  

Visual acuity might be expressed as the spatial resolving power (SRP), calculated from the 

peaks of RGCs density (Collin &amp;amp; Pettigrew, 1989; Ullmann et al, 2011; de Busserolles, 2013). SRP 

is determined by the number of cells subtended by one degree of visual arc, e.g., the visual angle 

(Collin &amp;amp; Pettigrew, 1989; Ullmann et al., 2011; de Busserolles, 2013). An evolutionary relation 

between visual acuity and the animal’s depth range can be expected, once acuity is limited by the 

available light (Warrant &amp;amp; Locket, 2004; McFall-Ngai et al, 1986; de Busserolles, 2013). In 

teleosts, visual acuity is also influenced by non-retinal characteristics of the eye, such as the pupil 

diameter, which constrains the received light (Warrant &amp;amp; Locket, 2004; de Busserolles, 2013; 

Nillson et al., 2004). In fact, acuity is directly related to eye size and lens diameter (Pankhurst, 

1987; Collin &amp;amp; Pettigrew, 1989; Douglas et al., 1998; de Busserolles, 2013). As stated, visual 



11 

 
 

 

 

 

sensitivity is more important to deep-sea fish than visual acuity. Sensitivity can be given by the 

level of PRs-RGCs convergence/summation ratio (Collin &amp;amp; Pettigrew, 1989; Ullmann et al, 2011; 

de Busserolles, 2013). A high degree of PRs-RGCs convergence ratio is linked to high visual 

sensitivity and it increases with fish growth (7:1 to 300:1) (McNulty, 1976; Locket, 1980). 

 

1.2. Lanternfish vision 

Myctophids (or lanternfishes) are mesopelagic fishes belonging to the diverse family 

Myctophidae that includes about 250 species and 33 genera in two sub-families: Myctophinae and 

Lampanyctinae (Moser et al., 1984; Catul et al., 2011). These fishes are characterized by high 

abundance populations and worldwide distribution, representing more than 20% of the oceanic 

icththyofauna and occupying upper and lower mesopelagic zones (Catul et al., 2011; Sutton, 2013). 

Myctophids’ development occurs mainly in the epipelagic zone where they carry most activities 

such as feeding and reproduction (Catul et al., 2011). Myctophids are dioecious pelagic spawners 

and females are oviparous with low fecundity rate (Catul et al., 2011). Eggs and pre-

metamorphosis larvae are planktonic, and larvae are daytime feeders, contrary to mesopelagic post-

metamorphic individuals and adults (Moser &amp;amp; Ahlstrom, 1972; Catul et al., 2011). Adult 

myctophid’s size range from 3 to 35 cm (Hulley, 1994), with lifespans of one year for tropical 

species and more than five years in temperate zones (Moser &amp;amp; Ahlstrom, 1972).  

Lanternfishes are also a major component of the DVM aggregations of mesopelagic species. 

Lanternfishes feed during the night, from dusk to dawn, following zooplankton DVM (Catul et al., 

2011; Vieira, 2011). They switch between day inactivity in the mesopelagic zone to night activity 

in the epipelagic zone where they feed on zooplankton, mainly copepods, euphasiids and 

amphipods (Shreeve et al., 2009). Patterns in diel vertical movements depend on life stage, sex, 

latitude, hydrography and season, and do not always involve the entire population (Catul et al., 

2011). Therefore, myctophids have an important role in biogeochemical fluxes, acting as a trophic 

link between zooplankton and their predators (e.g., marine mammals, seabirds and cephalopods) 

(Trueman et al., 2014).  

Myctophids possess ventrolateral photophores (Fig. 4) used for counterillumination, but also for 

intraspecific and, perhaps, interspecific communication (Moser &amp;amp; Ahlstrom, 1972; Mensinger &amp;amp; 

Case, 1997). Probably, for intraspecific communication, myctophids rely on species-specific 

photophore emitting light patterns to communicate within a swimming school, individual 

identification and even courtship signalling (Cocker, 1978; Turner et al., 2009; Haddock et al., 

2010). Some species present gender specific luminous caudal glands, either supracaudal (males) or 



12 

 
 

 

 

 

infracaudal (females) (Salvanes &amp;amp; Kristoffersen, 2001; Catul et al., 2011). Some myctophid species 

possess luminous organs, which are opaque patches of luminous tissue that differs structurally and 

in light signal from the photophores (Moser &amp;amp; Ahlstrom, 1972; Barnes &amp;amp; Case, 1974; Edwards &amp;amp; 

Herring, 1977). These organs present a different physiological control and produce quicker and 

brighter flashes than photophores (Barnes &amp;amp; Case, 1974; Edwards &amp;amp; Herring, 1977). Additionally, 

some species show luminous patches on the head which produce bright flashes that may confuse 

predators and illuminate prey (e.g. Ceratoscopelus spp. and Diaphus spp.) (Barnes &amp;amp; Case, 1974; 

Edwards &amp;amp; Herring, 1977; Haddock et al. 2010). Head photophores or luminous patches enhance 

the myctophids’ visual acuity but may also expose them to predators (Cocker, 1978; Mensinger &amp;amp; 

Case, 1997; Haddock et al., 2010; Catul et al., 2011). Some myctophid species might even be able 

to detect long wavelength light emitted by other deep-sea species (Turner et al., 2009; Haddock et 

al., 2010). 

 

 

Figure 4 - Scheme of generic myctophid photophore pattern. From Moser et al. (1984). Acronyms for 

photophore groups are presented. 

Besides the general vision characteristics shared by deep-sea fishes, most myctophids are 

mainly adapted to their bioluminescence ?Imax (469-474 nm), as there is a wide interval of 

wavelength from their prey or their predators to themselves (Partridge et al., 1988; Turner et al., 

2009). Light modulation is under neural control through physiological processes involving nitric 

oxide; myctophids are able to control ventral photophores luminescence to almost instantly match 

the downwelling light (Cocker, 1978; Young et al., 1979; Mensinger &amp;amp; Case, 1997; Krönström &amp;amp; 

Mallefet, 2010). As this wavelength match is not perfect, some predators may distinguish their 

preys’ counter-illumination silhouette (Young et al., 1979; Johnsen et al., 2004; Turner et al., 

2009). 

The majority of myctophids present retinas with single-pigment rhodopsin, ?max of 480-492 

nm (Mensinger &amp;amp; Case, 1997; Hasegawa et al., 2008). However, according to Mensinger &amp;amp; Case 

(1997), Hasegawa et al. (2008) and de Busserolles (2013) there are a few double-pigmented with 



13 

 
 

 

 

 

rhodopsin/pophyropsin or two rhodopsins species, for instance in the genus Myctophum. Non-

paired rhodopsin/porphyropsin may be an adaptation for detecting stomiid predators’ red light 

(porphyropsine) and shorter-wave light (rhodopsin) (Mensinger &amp;amp; Case, 1997; Hasegawa et al., 

2008). Hasegawa et al. (2008) also suggest the disparity of ?max between the two pigments may 

indicate not only larger spectral range but also colour vision for these deep-sea fishes. Two 

additional retinal specializations are present in myctophids: a fundal pigmentation, probably a 

modified pigment of epithelial cells of a visual specialization important at larval stages; and a 

photostable yellow pigment, only found in species of the subfamily Myctophinae, which seems to 

be used to enhance contrast and improve the detection of bioluminescent signals (de Busserolles, 

2013).  

 

1.3. Aims and objectives 

The main aim of this study is to contribute to the knowledge of how retinal organization can 

reflect the visual needs of myctophids in the mesopelagic zone. 

The specific objectives are:  

• to determine visual specializations of photoreceptors and retinal ganglion cells 

• to estimate visual acuity and sensitivity, particularly sensitivity to downwelling sunlight 

and sensitivity to bioluminescence by analysing the topography of photoreceptors, and 

retinal ganglion cell densities in adult myctophids of different species; 

• to interpret the data obtained in relation to morphometric, phylogenetic, environmental 

and behavioural data available for the myctophid species studied.

2. Materials and methods 

2.1. Collection of specimens 

Adult myctophids were collected during the R/V Poseidon cruise P446 at Senghor Seamount 

(Fig. 5), which is located ca. 60 nm east to the Island of Sal, Cape Verde (Central Eastern Atlantic), 

on February 2013. Six IKMT (Isaac-Kid Mid-Water Trawl) trawls were conducted between the 

surface and 500 m depth from dusk to midnight. Immediately after recovery of the catch, fishes 

were measured for total length (± 1 mm) and preserved in a seawater and 4% paraformaldehyde 

solution, until identification and dissection. All the fishes were captured under the same conditions 

except Symbolophorus sp., which was found on the deck (Table I).  

 

Note: This part of the study was not performed by the author. The collection of specimens was 

carried out by  Rui Pedro Vieira.

For each individual, full body photographs were taken with a digital camera, while eyes were 

photographed under a dissection microscope. The following morphometric parameters were 

measured using ImageJ 1.47V (Rasband, 1997-2014): 1. Total and Standard Lengths
1
 (TL and SL, 

respectively); 2. Rostrocaudal and Dorsoventral Eye Diameters (RC-ED and DV-ED, respectively); 

3. Lens Diameter (LD).  

Fishes eyes were enucleated and the retinas extracted and observed under light microscopy 

(100x objective for PRs and 40x for ACs/RGCs) for retinal wholemount analyses of PRs, ACs and 

RGCs (Appendix I). This procedure allows one to develop density topographic maps for these 

neural cells, and subsequently to identify visual specializations and density peaks of neural cells 

(Collin &amp;amp; Pettigrew, 1989; Ullmann et al., 2011; de Busserolles, 2013). Horizontal scans of the 

retinas were performed to define sampling areas (SAs). Coordinates were registered for each SA 

and neural cells were counted to estimate cell densities. SAs coordinates allowed to create 

topographic maps that incorporate cell density values from 200 selected SAs. Finally, a colour 

gradient was used to match the cell density value in order to represent the distribution of cell

densities along the retina. Retinas were stained with Cresyl violet to distinguish RGCs and ACs. 

Cell counts and production of retinal maps were done with ImageJ 1.47V and GIMP 2.8.10. The 

Schaffer Coefficient of Error (CE) was applied to ensure cell number estimation: 

CE=1/?Q, where Q represents the number of cells counted. 

 

2.3. Visual parameters estimations 

Visual parameters were estimated following Collin &amp;amp; Pettigrew (1989), Ullmann et al. (2011) 

and de Busserolles (2013). Visual sensitivity was calculated from PRs-RGCs convergence, from 

the peak densities of neural cells. Visual acuity, expressed as SRP, was calculated from the peaks 

of RGCs density. For SRP estimates, Matthiessen’s ratio was used to calculate the distance from 

the centre of a lens to the retina (posterior nodal distance, PND). Mattthiessen’s ratio states that the 

focal length in fishes is ?2,55 the radius of the lens:  

PND = 2,55 x r, where r is the radius of the lens. 

 

The angle (?) subtending 1 mm on the retina is given by: 

tan(?) = 1mm/PND. 

 

SRP is determined by the number of cells.mm
-1

 subtended by 1 degree of visual arch: 

Cells per degree = density at peak area/PND. 

 

To distinguish the light-dark boundaries for 1 cycle of grating of the highest resolvable 

frequency, at least 2 cells are needed: 

SRP (cycles per degree) = cells per degree/2. 

 

Visual sensitivities to downwelling light and bioluminescent point sources were estimated for  

the different specimens.. Sensitivity to downwelling light (S, extended light scene, expressed in 

mm
-2

.sr
-2

) was calculated by the following equation:

  Steradian – SI Unit for solid angle (Warrant &amp;amp; Locket, 2004).

where d, k and l are the diameter, absorption coefficient and outer segment length of the PRs, 

respectively. As k is fixed at 0.035 µm-1, which is the average value for vertebrates, and 1,275 

represents a constant that relates the size of pupil and lens, in this equation, S is related to PRs 

diameter and outer segments length (de Busserolles, 2013). The diameter, d, was measured in 

median density areas of PRs in the retina. The length l was obtained from de Busserolles (2013).  

Sensitivity to bioluminescent flashes (N, point source of light, in photons) is given by the 

following formula: 

 

 

where E represents the number of photon emitted at the source, A is for the pupil diameter 

(meters), r is the distance (meters) between the light source and the eye, ? represents the 

attenuation coefficient of bioluminescence (combining the scattering and absorption of light by the 

water molecules), and k, l are the absorption coefficient and outer segment length of the PRs, 

respectively. As the pupil diameter was replaced by the lens diameter for A, as E was set at 10
10

 

photons, r at 1m, ? at 0,05 m
-1

, and k at 0.035 µm-1, N is related to the lens’ size and the outer 

segment length of PRs (see Warrant &amp;amp; Locket, 2004; and de Busserolles, 2013).

3. Results 

3.1. Distribution of neural cells density 

The analysed retinas were degraded and, consequently, mapping of the PRs and RGCs/ACs 

from the same eye was only possible for H. taaningii and C. warmingii specimens. Yellow 

pigmented patches were not observed, and fundal pigmentation was not distinguishable in most of 

the retinas analysed. No retinal tapeta were observed. 

 

3.1.1. Photoreceptors 

All the analysed myctophid species present pure-rod retinas with a single rod type, and cells 

densely packed with a hexagonal arrangement. Rod densities
1
 varied within each individual retina 

and between individuals (in this case corresponding to different species) (Fig. 6). Peaks of PRs 

densities are shown in Table II. Rod densities are higher for Diaphus rafinesquii, Symbolophorus 

sp. and Lampadena sp. and lower for Hygophum taaningi and Lepidophanes guentheri.

As identified by several authors (e.g. Collin &amp;amp; Pettigrew, 1989, Collin et al., 2000, and de 

Busserolles, 2014), specific patterns of rods suggest visual specializations. Diaphus holti present an 

arch through the dorsal-temporal part of the retina with peak density in the ventral-temporal zone 

(Fig. 7A) with 1096 x 10
3
 cells.mm

-2
. Lampadena sp. also shows a dorsal-temporal arch, with a 

peak density of 1368 x 10
3
 cells.mm

-2 
located in the dorsal part of the retina (Fig. 7D). For D. 

rafinesquii, the arch is located across the nasal-ventral-temporal region of the retina, with the peaks 

of rods’ density in the retina’s temporal and nasal zones (Fig. 7B) with 1250 x 10
3
 cells.mm

-2
. 

Symbolophorus sp. and H. taaningi present streak-like specializations.  Symbolophorus sp. shows a 

ventral streak with peak density, located in the ventral zone of the retina (Fig. 7C) of 1318 x 10
3
 

cells.mm
-2

. However, the streak specialization for H. taaningi is located through the nasal-ventral 

zone of the retina (Fig. 7E) showing a peak density of 692 x 10
3
 cells.mm

-2
. Contrary to the former 

species, L. guentheri and C. warmingii present ring specializations, showing higher cell densities 

between the centre and the periphery of the retina in a ring-like shape. The first species shows a 

peak cell density of 752 x 10
3
 cells.mm

-2
 across the retina (Fig. 7F) while C. warmingii present 

temporal-ventral peak cell density (Fig. 7G) with 1090 x 10
3
 cells.mm

-2
. 

Except for Symbolophorus sp. and H. taaningi, the aphakic gap projection appears to match the 

rods’ peak density areas (Fig. 7).

3.1.2. Amacrine cells and retinal ganglion cells 

All the analysed species showed a similar arrangement and densities of ACs and RGCs. The 

analysed retinas suggests that ACs present greater densities and higher variance (Table III), 

“surrounding” RGCs (Fig. 8). Contrary to PRs, CE is higher than 0,1 for RGCs and ACs, probably 

representing an inaccurate counting. This pattern was predictable, once RGCs and ACs were 

observed and counted under a 40x objective with less than 200 SAs.

In all cases ACs and RGCs density patterns were similar for the same specimen and densities of 

these cells were always higher in the periphery of the retinas (Fig. 9). 



22 
 

 
 

Except for Symbolophorus sp. and L. guentheri, which do not display clear specializations (Fig. 

9C2 and 9F2, respectively), the analysed species present areae specializations for RGCs. Diaphus 

holti presented an area temporalis (Fig. 9A2) with a density peak of 33 x 10
3

. Diaphus 

rafinesquii shown an area ventro-temporalis (Fig. 9B2) with a density peak of 27 x 10

-2
. 

Lampadena sp. presented an area dorso-temporalis (Fig. 9D2) with 20 x 10

-2
. Hygophum. 

taaningi seems to have an area temporalis and an area rostralis (Fig. 9E2) with density peaks of 18 

x 10
3
 cells.mm

-2
. The latter indication must be considered  with caution, because the temporal zone 

of the retina was accidentally damaged during the tissue preparation. C. warmingii presented an 

area ventro-rostralis (Fig. 9G2) with a density peak of 20 x 10
3
 cells.mm

-2
.  

Aphakic gap projections appears to be coincident with higher densities of RGCs, except for 

Symbolophorus sp. and H. taaningi (Fig. 9).

respectively, are presented in Table IV. Acuity and sensitivity seems to not vary greatly between 

species, but both parameters were higher for Symbolophorus sp. and Lampadena sp. Acuity was 

lower for L. guentheri while D. holti and H. taaningi showed lower sensitivity values.  

Sensitivity to downwelling light (S) and bioluminescence (N) seems to not vary much between 

species (Table IV). As l value for Diaphus rafinesquii and Lepidophanes guentheri was not found 

in the literature available, data on sensitivity to downwelling light and bioluminescence for this 

species is not presented. Diaphus holti showed the lowest values for sensitivity to sunlight and 

bioluminescence, while Symbolophorus sp. and Lampadena sp. presented higher sensitivity to 

bioluminescence and lower sensitivity to downwelling light. Hygophym taaningi and C. warmingii 

presented low sensitivity to bioluminescence, but high sensitivity to sunlight.

4. Discussion 

4.1. Topography of neural cells’ density and visual parameters 

4.1.1. Photoreceptors 

All the species analysed present pure-rod retina with high density of PRs, reflecting the known 

high visual sensitivity of myctophids’ retinas (O’Day &amp;amp; Fernandez, 1976; Pankhurst, 1987; 

Wagner et al., 1998; Sabatés et al., 2003; de Busserolles, 2013). High visual sensitivity of 

myctophids shows an adaptation to the dim and monochromatic light regimes characteristic of the 

mesopelagic zone (Douglas et al., 1995; Douglas et al., 1998; Turner et al., 2009). Additionally, 

these fishes use bioluminescence for communication, feeding and reproduction (Cocker, 1978; 

Mensinger &amp;amp; Case, 1997; Turner et al., 2009; Haddock et al., 2010). Therefore, the perception of a 

faint point of light is essential to their ecological success. 

Distribution patterns of rod densities reflect visual specializations, which can be associated to 

the visual needs and behaviour of the fish (Collin &amp;amp; Pettigrew, 1989; Collin et al., 2000; de 

Busserolles, 2013). The analysed myctophid species present different rod specializations. Rod 

densities, given in Table II, differed within the same retina but also between species, suggesting 

species-specific visual needs (see Fig. 7). In the analysed species the position of the aphakic gap 

allows the projection of the light on the retinal zones with high PRs density, except in the species 

presenting streak-like PRs specialization. The aphakic gap allows “extra” light on the retina 

(Warrant &amp;amp; Locket, 2004; de Busserolles, 2013), while photoreceptors function is to maximize the 

photon catch (Yokoyama &amp;amp; Yokoyama, 1996; Warrant &amp;amp; Locket, 2004; Turner et al., 2009). 

Consequently, the retinal zones with higher photon incidence are also the more sensitive areas of 

the retina, enhancing eye’s photon catch. This concordance may depend upon the type of PRs 

specialization, but the examination of a larger number of individuals is required to confirm the 

exception found in the species with a streak-like specialization of (e.g. Symbolophorus sp. and 

Hygophum taaningi,) also observed by de Busserolles  (2013) in other myctophids. Diaphus holti 

and Lampadena sp. showed a dorsal-temporal arch, meaning that the incident light in this region 

has origin in the lower frontal area of the fish visual field. This type of arch specializations may be 

used to detect bioluminescence sources from below (de Busserolles, 2013). Diaphus rafinesquii 

shows a nasal-ventral-temporal arch, capturing light from the upper frontal part of the fish’s visual 

field. This arrangement may be linked to enable the ability to distinguish predators or prey 

silhouettes against the background (de Busserolles, 2013). The distinction of upper silhouettes may 

also be assigned to the ventral streak-like specialized retinas in Symbolophorus sp. and H. taaningi. 

Ring specializations observed in Lepidophanes guentheri and Ceratoscopelus warmingii might be 

related to the light projected by the circumlental aphakic gap (see Fig 7). The peak density of rods 



27 

 

in the temporal-ventral zone of C. warmingii retina suggests this region has an important role 

receiving the light coming from the upper front of the fish.  

The circumlental aphakic gap allows an increased visual field in every direction. PRs ring 

specializations are present in visual generalists or fishes that do not rely much in vision as an 

important sensorial system (de Busserolles, 2014). Most likely, L. guentheri and C. warmingii are 

visual generalists, once they have several visual stimuli from different directions. Myctophids are 

able to produce bioluminescent light, but are also subjected to great light gradients. Therefore, they 

seem to rely strongly on vision to succeed in such environment (Young et al., 1979; Partridge et al., 

1988; Johnsen et al., 2004; Turner et al., 2009), namely by using it to avoid predators and forage 

preys (Catul et al., 2011: Murphy et al., 2007; Shreeve et al., 2009). 

 

4.1.2. Amacrine cells and retinal ganglion cells 

Myctophid neural cells densities here estimated are higher than those obtained by de Busserolles 

(2013). This might be explained as an observations bias, but also due to the degradation of the 

retinas and some handling procedures (see Appendix II).  

ACs and RGCs densities do not seem to vary much across the retina or between species (see 

Table III). According to several authors (Collin &amp;amp; Pettigrew, 1989; Wagner et al., 1998; Warrant &amp;amp; 

Locket, 2004) this is an indication of low visual acuity. Considering that mesopelagic depths are 

characterized by dim and monochromatic light, acuity is not crucial to the animals that inhabit this 

oceanic zone (Pankhurst, 1987; Warrant &amp;amp; Locket, 2004; de Busserolles, 2013). Under these light 

regimes the detection of a faint light signal (sensitivity) may be far more important for mesopelagic 

fishes than perceiving images with great definition (acuity). 

ACs and RGCs density estimates were always higher in the retinal periphery and the 

topography of these two types of neurons revealed some similarities (see Fig. 9). Both types of 

neural cells show similar distributions (Collin &amp;amp; Pettigrew, 1989). However, ACs functions are still 

not well understood, and the inclusion of these neural cells in SRP calculations may led to an 

overestimation of acuity (Wagner et al., 1998; de Busserolles, 2013). Additionally, since RGCs 

represent the gateway of visual information to the brain (Wagner et al., 1998; Warrant &amp;amp; Locket, 

2004), only this cell type will be discussed below.  

Even if RGCs densities showed little variation across the retina in the analysed species, area 

specializations are present, and this indicates that visual acuity is important for these fishes’ visual 

capabilities (Collin &amp;amp; Pettigrew, 1989; Wagner et al., 1998; Collin et al., 2000; de Busserolles, 

2013).  Although less precisely than for PRs, aphakic gaps are also coincident with the RGCs peak 

density zones. The exceptions are the PRs streak specialized retinas of Symbolophorus sp. and H. 

taaningi. These two species also differ in their relative (spatial) alignment of the PRs and RGCs 



28 

 

density peaks. As the light emitted by counterillumination presents a wavelength range similar to 

the downwelling light (Partridge et al., 1989; Turner et al., 2009; Haddock et al., 2010) and 

myctophids communicate with light patterns (Moser &amp;amp; Ahlstrom, 1972; Moser et al., 1984; 

Mensinger &amp;amp; Case, 1997; Catul et al., 2011), some acuity is needed to distinct the silhouette of a 

conspecific from a predator or a prey (Cocker, 1978; Yokoyama &amp;amp; Yokoyama, 1996; Johnsen et al., 

2004; Turner et al., 2009). This PRs and RGCs alignment may allow a better silhouette distinction 

against the downwelling background light (de Busserolles, 2013), as stated before for the ventral 

arch specialization of PRs in D. rafinesquii. The correspondence of PRs and RGCs peak densities 

with the aphakic gaps corroborates that visual acuity may also be important for these fishes.  

The analysed species presented areae (see Fig. 9), which may reflect similar visual needs for 

acuity. Exceptions are Symbolophorus sp. and L. guentheri which do not present any clear RGCs 

specialization which might be linked to an improved visual sensitivity (de Busserolles, 2013). 

However, these conclusions should be taken carefully, because RGCs specializations were 

previously observed in Symbolophorus species (de Busserolles, 2013). Differences in the present 

study and results obtained by de Busserolles (2013) might be explained by the degradation of 

retinas or methodological issues here. Diaphus holti, D. rafinesquii, Lampadena sp. and H. 

taaningi present areae temporales reflecting an enhanced acuity in relation to the front visual field 

of the animal. This may probably facilitate the binocular vision for predation or adaptation to a 

structurally complex habitat (de Busserolles, 2013), which are ecological traits of myctophids, as 

previously stated. Hygophum taaningi seems to show also an area in the nasal part of the retina that, 

similar to C. warmingii area in the ventral-nasal zone of the retinas but no similar observation was 

found in the available literature. Eye misorientation might have occurred during the RGCs analysis 

of C.warmingii retina, since de Busserolles (2013) observed an area ventro-temporalis for the same 

species. Nevertheless, the presence of a ventral areae in the retina of C. warmingii, suggests 

enhanced acuity in relation to the upper part of the visual field, used for distinction of silhouettes 

above the fish. The case of H. taaningi will be addressed later. 

 

4.1.3. Visual acuity and sensitivity 

Investigation of the retinas of the seven myctophid species in this study revealed that visual 

sensitivity was higher for Symbolophorus sp. and Lampadena sp (see Table IV). Both species 

presented higher rod peak density and PRs-RGCs convergence, when compared to the other 

myctophids. Diaphus holti and H. taaningi presented lower values of visual sensitivity. Hygophum 

taaningi also showed lower rod peaks density, but that was not found in D. holti. Visual acuity is 

calculated using the lens size. This seems to influence and explain the acuity values, as these are 

higher for Symbolophorus sp. and Lampadena sp which present the larger lenses (Table V), and 



29 

 

lower for L. guentheri with the smaller lens. As referred above, Symbolophorus sp. and L. 

guentheri do not present any clear RGCs specialization, which may be linked to increased visual 

sensitivity. In fact, this may be corroborated by the fact that both species present higher visual 

sensitivity than acuity, when compared to the other analysed species (Fig. 10).   

 Sensitivity to downwelling light (S) is linked to higher diameter of PRs, while sensitivity to 

bioluminescent light (N) to bigger eyes (see Materials and Methods). PRs diameter are higher for C. 

warmingii (d = 1,00 µ m) and H. taaningi  (d = 1,04 µm) and lower for D. holti  and D. rafinesquii 

(d = 0,73 and 0,76 µ m, respectively), corresponding to the higher S values for C. warmingii and H. 

taaningi  and  lower for Diaphus holti.  As N is linked to the size of the eye and the lens, the values 

for N have the same explanation as referred above for visual acuity.  Apart from Diaphus holti 

which present the lower values for S and N (Fig. 11), the analysed species seem to be more 

sensitive to downwelling light (H. taaningi and C. warmingii) or to bioluminescent flashes 

(Symbolophorus sp. and Lampadena sp.). These results corroborates the early suggestions that 

Lampadena sp. PRs arch specialization may be used to perceive bioluminescent flashes and the 

ring of C. warmingii for perception of silhouettes against the downwelling light background. Low 

values of visual sensitivity (including S and N) and high visual acuity estimated for Diaphus holti 

suggests it may rely less on sensitivity to light.

RGCs convergence).

Figure 11 – Dot plot showing the values of sensitivity to downwelling light (S, in µ m
2
.sr) and to 

bioluminescence (N, in photons). 

 

As stated before, aphakic gaps do not coincide with RGCs or PRs peak densities for the PRs 

streak specialized retinas of Symbolophorus sp. and H. taaningi. Also RGCs peak densities do not 

correspond to PRs ones for these two species. Symbolophorus sp. is more sensitive to 

bioluminescence but no clear RGCs specialization (see Fig. 9), so the acuity does not seem 

important. This corroborates the early suggestion that Symbolophorus sp. uses the ventral aphakic 

gap to detect bioluminescent signals from below. On the other hand, H. taaningi is more sensitive 

to downwelling light and present RGCs specialization, so the acuity seems to have more 

importance for this species, essentially at the front horizontal axis. Hygophum taaningi seems to be 

better adapted to distinct silhouettes against the downwelling light background on the upper frontal 

visual field. However, because of the low number of samples this interpretation must be taken with 

caution.  

These results show that visual acuity is relatively low (SRP from 2.58 to 5.13) and sensitivity is 

high (PRs-RGCs convergence from 31:1 to 73:1) when compared to other deep-sea fish families 

(e.g. Argyropelecus sladeni, SRP = 12:1 and convergence = 8.4; Alepocephalus bairdii, SRP = 22.9; 

Scopelarchus michaelsarsi, convergence = 29:1, from Wagner et al., 1998). One could expect that 

these observations are due to patterns in mesopelagic light regimes, as already explained above. 

Estimated visual sensitivity is low when compared to other myctophids of the same genera in de 

Busserolles (2013), but acuity showed higher values. Additionally, estimates of sensitivity to 

downwelling light are lower, while estimates of sensitivity to bioluminescent light are higher, when 

compared with the values obtained by de Busserolles (2013). These values divergences may be 

related with observation bias and methodological issues (see Appendix II).

4.2. Vision and natural history traits in myctophids 

4.2.1. Morphology 

Eye size is linked to visual parameters, as explained above for SRP and N.  Species with larger 

eyes (Symbolophorus sp. and Lampadena sp.) present higher visual sensitivity (see Table V), 

probably because the area of retinal tissue is larger and thus contains more rods. Luminous patches 

and sexual dimorphism do not seem to relate with any retinal characteristics analysed in this study, 

but a larger sample size is needed to explain these results. de Busserolles (2013) states that 

myctophids with no luminous patches and with deeper distribution profiles possess higher 

sensitivity to downwelling light and species with sexual dimorphism possess higher sensitivity 

(higher rod densities). 

 

4.2.2. Depth range and diel vertical migration 

Information on depth ranges was retrieved from Hulley (1989) and vertical migration data is 

given by Watanabe et al (1999). Since it was not possible to identify the specimens of 

Symbolophorus and Lampadena to species level, their depth distribution was inferred from the 

available data on the species of the respective genera present in Cape Verde waters, e.g. 

Symbolophorus veranyi and Lampadena urophaos. In fact, species depth ranges do not vary greatly 

within Symbolophorus and Lampadena genera (Hulley, 1989). The available information on depth 

distribution was used to infer, DVM patterns for species that were not analysed in Watanabe et al., 

(1999). Because all the analysed specimens were adults, only the data on adults was used.  

Visual parameters – sensitivity and acuity - appear to be not related with DVM patterns or 

distances covered by these species, but this was not the case for the PRs specializations. Species 

with arch specializations are Non-migrators (D. rafinesquii) and mid-water migrators (D. holti and 

Lampadena sp.). The fact that D. rafinesquii inhabits only the upper mesopelagic zone, where 

downwelling light is the main source of light (Wagner et al., 1998; Warrant &amp;amp; Locket, 2004; Yakir 

et al., 2013), is in agreement with the occurrence of a ventral arch specialization to capture light 

from above and favouring  silhouette distinction. Results also suggest that Diaphus species might 

rely less on sensitivity, which can be related with an upper mesopelagic habitat, where 

downwelling is the main light source (Wagner et al., 1998; Warrant &amp;amp; Locket, 2004; Yakir et al., 

2013). The low DVM distances of D. holti and Lampadena sp. may explain the retinal 

specialization found in these species. Arches focus a specific part of the visual field (de Busserolles, 

2013), and their specializations in the dorsal region of retinas can detect bioluminescent light from 



32 

 

below. Lampadena sp. presents higher sensitivity to bioluminescent flashes than D. holti which 

may be linked to the fact that Lampadena sp. inhabits both upper and lower mesopelagic (Fig. 12).  

Streak-like specializations were found in surface-migrators (Symbolophorus sp. and H. 

taaningi). Their rod specializations capture light from above allowing these species to distinguish 

silhouettes against the downwelling light (Wagner et al., 1998; Warrant &amp;amp; Locket, 2004; Yakir et 

al., 2013). However, Symbolophorus sp. seems to be more sensitive to bioluminescent flashes than 

H. taaningi.  

Mid-water migrators L. guentheri and C. warmingii (Fig. 12) showed ring specializations, 

which were found in visual generalist species (de Busserolles, 2013). This is probably related to the 

fact that these species are able to perform long vertical migrations and, consequently, are exposed 

to more dynamic light scenarios. The temporal-ventral peak density of rods in C. warmingii’s ring 

maybe used to further recognise silhouettes from above the fish.

represent daytime depth distributions and black bars night-time depth. Depth data from Hulley (1989) and 

DVM data from Watanabe et al. (1999). 

 

4.2.3. Phylogenetic relations 

de Busserolles (2013) observed a phylogenetic relationship on RGCs specializations, but the 

sample size and the number of taxa used in the present study cannot be used to confirm such 

patterns.  Nevertheless, the data presented here suggests that PRs specializations are interspecific. 

Streak-like specialized retinas only occured in species of the Myctophinae sub-family 

(Symbolophorus sp. and H. taaningi) while arches and rings only occurred in species of the 

Lampanyctinae sub-family (D. holti, D. rafinesquii, Lampadena sp., L. guentheri and C. 



33 

 

warmingii). In the same way, ring specializations were found in Ceratoscopelus warmingii and 

Lepidophanes guentheri which accord to Moser et al. (1984) are phylogenetically close. This 

shows that besides ecological parameters, such as biotic interactions, depth distributions, DVM 

patterns and light regimes, myctophids vision can also be phylogenetically constrained but once 

again, the data presented here must be analysed carefully, since this study only includes one 

individual in each of seven myctophid species. 

 

 

 

5. Conclusion  

All the analysed myctophid species revealed high visual sensitivity and low acuity, showing a 

visual adaptation to the mesopelagic dim and monochromatic light. Higher density and variations 

in rods than for RGCs support the fact that myctophids rely more on visual sensitivity than acuity. 

Even if some parameters do not vary much between species, some of them (Symbolophorus sp. and 

Lampadena sp.) seem to be more specialized for sensitivity to bioluminescence, while other (H. 

taaningi and C. warmingii) to the downwelling sunlight. This indicates that species are well 

adapted to these two types of light sources, which characterize the mesopelagic zone. The existence 

of different visual specializations for PRs and RGCs of the myctophids’ retinas indicates that these 

fishes rely on vision for different ecological tasks.

 It was used a 100x dilution of a 10M commercial PBS solution (PBS without Ca and Mg (10x,) 1000ml, 

BioWhittaker Europe). 



I. Eye orientation and enucleation 

1. Before enucleation external characteristics
3
 of the eye were annotated, and a digital 

photograph taken (Fig. 1). Photographs were taken to ensure the correct eye orientation. 

 

 

Figure 1 –Lepidophanes guentheri showing the left eye before enucleation.  

 

2. While holding the fish head with the fine forceps, the eye was gently rotated forward and 

the conjunctiva (Fig. 2) cut with a microknife.

3. The eyeball was gently pulled out from the orbit and the adipose and muscle tissues cut, 

with mini-scissor. The optical nerve was gently cut, leaving a small portion of it.

 Mainly, differences in pigmentation of the iris and aphakic gap. 



4. Digital photographs of the enucleated eye were taken and eye dimensions measurement 

(Fig. 3).

diameters. The white arrow points the dorsal orientation of the eye. 

 

II. Opening the eye and cornea and lens extraction 

1. The eye was placed with the cornea side up. With fine forceps, the cornea was gently hold 

to show a small fold, in order to easily be cut with mini-scissors.  

2. The cornea was cut along the edge with mini-scissors, slowly to avoid damaging the iris, 

once its pigmentation is the main orientation reference. Lens was gently pulled out from 

the orbit and the lens muscles cut with miniforceps 

3. Digital photographs of the lens were taken to measure the diameter of the lens (Fig. 4). 

Then, the lens was kept in PBS buffer.

guentheri. 



III. Retinal fixation
4
 

1. The entire eyecup was submerged in paraformaldehyde with phosphate buffer for 60-120 

minutes. Fixation solution should be 5 times the eyecup volume, at least. When 

manoeuvring the eyecup, special care was taken to hold it from the remaining muscles or 

optic nerve, with fine forceps.  

2. The eyecup was removed from the fixation solution and washed in PBS, for approximately 

1 minute.  

 

IV. Retinal extraction 

1. The eyecup was placed in a Petri dish with chilled PBS under the dissection microscope. 

2. Using fine forceps and mini-scissors, the iris was gently cut along the edge, with the 

exception of the dorsal part, for orientation purposes.  

3. The vitreous humour (and some cornea and iris remains, eventually) was gently pulled with 

fine forceps and cut with the mini-scissors. As this is a transparent tissue and it is located 

near the retina, it was not entirely removed, to avoid to damaging the retina.  

4. For orientation purposes, with the mini-scissors. the dorsal position of the retina was gently 

marked, with a deep radial cut, about 2/3 of its radius, with care to do not cut near the optic 

nerve. This cut helps to open the sclera. 

5. The eyeball was turned with the dorsal side up, to facilitate the access to the scleral cut 

made right before.  

6. The sclera was cut all around, perpendicularly to the radial cut. The cut has to be done 

really gently, since the scissors can get in contact with the retina, damaging it. As the cut 

goes through, the sclera and choroidal tissue detach from the retina by itself, so the 

detached tissue can be gently cut and removed. 

7. Sclera was removed with care to avoid damaging the retina. 

8. Using a paintbrush, the remaining choroid and retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) were 

removed. When small portions of the RPE were hard to detach from the retinal periphery, 

it was not removed to avoid damaging the retina. 

9. The remaining optic nerve was gently removed and a digital photograph was taken (Fig. 

5A). 

 

 
4
 For teleosts, Ullmann et al. (2011) and De Busserolles, (2013) recommend retinal fixation prior to removal 



10. Finally, with the mini-scissors, 3-4 clean radial cuts about 2/3 of the retinal radius diameter 

were done, to allow the retina to be flattened without ripping it. A digital photograph was 

taken (Fig. 5B). The radial cuts can be done only when placed the retina on the slide, since 

the retina is more fragile with the cuts 

 

 

Figure 5 – Extracted retina from the left eye of Lepidophanes guentheri, showing A) pre- and B) post radial 

cuts. Arrows indicates the dorsal side of the eye. 

 

V. Cover slips and slides preparation 

When possible, new cover slips were used, when recycled slides were used, they were cleaned with 

ethanol 96%. 

For RGCs mountings, gelatinized slides are required. For this purpose, cover one side of the 

slide with Gatenby’s solution 2 or 3 times. To ensure the slides were dry between coatings, they 

were placed into an oven at 37ºC. After the last coating, gelatinized slides were kept at the oven for 

minimum 8 hours. 

To avoid any damage to the retina while examining it, a spacer was created from paper strips 

and nail varnish, as glue. As the spacer should be slightly thicker than the retina, two paper layers 

were used (Fig. 6). This technique was only used for RGCs permanent mounting, since PRs 

mountings were temporary, only a few quantity of glue was used between the edges of the slide and 

cover slip. Also, with dry glue it is easy to take off the cover slip without brake it, avoiding glass 

fragments on the retina’s surface. 

 



 

 

Figure 6 – Scheme of the RGCs mounting showing the spacer and the retina inside. Red lines represent the 

layers of nail varnish and the arrows point to the two paper strips layers (white bands) in it. Dashed lines 

represent the retina inside the mounting.   

 

VI. Retinal wholemounting  

Since RGCs mounting involve gelatinized slides and staining procedures, for visualization of the 

neural cells on the same retina, PRs were examined before. For PRs observation, the scleral side of 

the retina has to be upwards, while for RGCs must be observed the vitreal side. 

The extracted retina was floated onto a non-gelatinized slide. This step presented more 

difficulties, because the retina can be easily damaged. In order to facilitate the transferring process, 

the Petri dish used for retinal extraction was filled with PBS, the slide was placed in it, and the 

retina was gently carried to the centre of the slide, scleral side up. Then, the slide was taken from 

the PBS and the buffer excess absorbed with a paper towel, with care to avoid touching the retina. 

A paintbrush was used to help flatten the retina, avoiding folds. 

 

VII. Retinal cell visualization 

VII.1. Photoreceptors 

1. One or two drops of glycerol were placed onto the mounted retina (Fig. 7) in order to 

obtain a 50/50 glycerol/buffer.  

2. PRs were observed under the 100x objective of an optical microscope (Fig. 8). A digital 

photograph of the mounted retina was taken after the observation of PRs. Because the 

retinas may be squashed and suffer small rips during the observation under the 100x 

objective, a post-observation photograph ensures a more accurate map.

mounting; B) Close look of a mounted retina from Lepidophanes guentheri. Arrow indicates the dorsal side 

of the eye.

microscope. 

 

VII.2. Retinal ganglion cells 

1. Using a scalpel, some pressure was gently made onto the glue to detach the cover slip from 

the slide. Once the cover slip was removed, the slide was gently scraped with a scalpel and 

cleaned with paper towel, to remove the remaining glue.  

2. Some drops of PBS were placed on the retina to remove the glycerol. 

3. The retina was placed on a freshly gelatinized slide, with the vitreal side facing up. For this 

purpose, the gelatinized slide was placed on the retina and a small pressure was gently 

applied. Then, the slides were turned upside-down and the non-gelatinized slide was slowly 

pulled up, in order to detach the retina without fragmenting the tissue. With the scleral side 

facing up, for PRs observation, this step places it directly with the vitreal side up, ready for 

the RGCs observation. A paintbrush was used to gently flatten the retina on the gelatinized 

slide, to avoid folds, and photographs were taken (Fig. 9A). 



4. In order to dry the retina on the gelatinized slide, it was placed horizontally, on a moist 

paper towel inside a Petri dish in the desiccator. The desiccator lid was first placed with 

just a little gap to avoid condensation, and it was gently opened every 3 or 4 days until the 

retina present a dry aspect (Fig. 9B).  

 

 

Figure 9 – Digital photographs of the left retina of a Lepidophanes guentheri. A) Before drying; and B) after 

drying. Arrow indicates the dorsal side of the eye. 

 

5. The retina was stained with 0,1% Cresyl violet, following procedure in Table I:

6. The staining solution excess was removed with paper towel, and the slide placed on paper 

towel for, at least, 30 minutes, to ensure the remaining histoclear drying.  



7. The mounting for RGCs (Fig. 10A) was done as explained in the Section V. The nail 

varnish was dry from layer to layer of the spacer and before the mounting media 

application. For this purpose, only one drop of glycerol was placed on the retina. Then, nail 

varnish was gently applied on the spacer, allowing it to glue the cover slip. Finally, the 

cover slip was slowly placed on the spacer (Fig. 10B).

look of a mounted retina from Lepidophanes guentheri. Arrow indicates the dorsal side of the eye. 

 

8. The retina was observed under the 40x objective of an optical microscope, to avoid the 

retina to get squashed and ripped during the observation.  

 

VIII. Mapping retinal cell distributions  

VIII.1. Photoreceptors 

1. Coordinates of the vertical and horizontal edges were annotated and a value was defined 

for the distance between sampling areas (SAs), in order to obtain more than 200
5
 SAs in 

any single retina. 

2. The retinas was then scanned from the top to the bottom by horizontal transects and from 

left to right side in each SA. Horizontal and vertical coordinates were taken for each 

transect and for each SA, respectively. Transects were labelled by a capital letter (in 

alphabetic order from the top to the bottom) and the SAs by numbers for each transects. 

3. Digital photographs were taken for each SA.Several photographs were taken per SA in 

order to focus different parts of the analysed area, as the retina present an irregular surface 

when mounted. 

 

 
5
 Value stablished by Ullmann et al. (2011) and de Busserolles, (2013). 



 

VIII.2. Retinal ganglion cells 

Contrary to PRs, RGCs are distinguishable with the 40x objective, so this objective was used for 

these neural cells’ observation. Nevertheless, the procedure for RGCs mapping, was similar to the 

PRs. Since the amplification used was lower for RGCs than PRs and the total SAs number rarely 

approached 200, the entire retinas was scanned. 

 

IX. Topographic map
6
 

1. Digital photographs of the retinas mountings were used to create the topographic maps (Fig. 

11A). 

2. Vertical and horizontal grids were added to the image and aligned with the respective axis 

edges of the outline. 

3. To create a preliminary map, 150 SAs were evenly selected and labelled in the image, 

aligned to the horizontal grid within each transect, and aligned with the vertical grid by 

transect (Fig 11B). 

4. The cells counting procedure was the same for PRs and RGCs, but for RGCs, ACs were 

simultaneously counted. One photograph per previously selected SA was chosen and a 100 

µ m
2
 grid applied. Five grid squares were chosen as counting replicates, from which a final 

average was calculated to represent the cell density for each selected SA (cells/100 µ m
2
).  

5. The cell densities for the selected SAs calculated in the step above replaced the respective 

SAs labels on the map (Fig. 11C). 

6. The cell densities were replaced by a numeric scale (Fig. 11D) that corresponds to the 

colour gradient of the topographic map (Fig. 11E).  

7. The layout obtained represents a preliminary map, as stated in (5). For the final map, 50 

non-selected SAs were included within the high density zones of the preliminary map. This 

aimed to achieve a greater definition by subsampling higher cell density areas of the retina. 

8. The final topographic map (Fig. 11F) should include: 1. retinal outline; 2. iso-density lines 

or colour gradation; 3. natural landmarks; 4. retinal orientation; and 5. scale bar.  

 

 

 
6
 For steps (e) (h) (i), ImageJ 1.47V was used. The rest was developed with GIMP 2.8.10.

Appendix II. Methodological issues 

 

The wholemounting technique protocol used in this study was primarily based on Ullmann et al. 

(2011), who presented a general procedure for vertebrates. The observation of other retinas from 

different fish species (not included in this study) revealed that myctophids possess a singular retina, 

and allowed a subsequent optimization of the protocol. In this way, some factors varied between 

retinal treatments for different specimens (Table I). For future observations, the transition of the 

retinas from the PRs mounting slide to the gelatinized one should be done by floating the retinas in 

PBS instead of turning slides upside-down (see Appendix I), in order to avoid a possible 

displacement of the retinas. Another further improvement should be the use of a permanent 

mounting media instead of glycerol, since this solution clears the neural cells, making them harder 

to distinguish within a month from the mounting process. The stress caused by the fishing or the 

post-mortem condition of the retinae might contribute to the difficulties found during the analysis. 

Additionally, fishes with smaller eyes possess smaller neural cells, and more difficult to distinguish. 

Some methodological implications seem to be related with the difficulty to analyse the neural cells: 

1) the specimens were already fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (see Material and methods, page 14) 

when retinas were collected. In the laboratory, an additional retinal fixation was done (see 

Appendix I, section III), which could have contributed to the brighter neural cells, making it 

difficult to distinguish; 2) a spacer should have been used to observe PRs, in order to avoid cells to 

squash, which makes it harder to identify these neurons; 3) retinas were not washed and incubated 

with PBS after PRs observations to remove all the remaining glue from the mountings, probably, 

affecting the staining conditions and, consequently, making RGCs difficult to distinguish.   

Damaged retinas (see Results) seem to limit the analyses of neural cells, because RGCs 

specializations were not always easy to distinguish (Fig. 1), which could have cause miscounting in 

some retinas (e.g. Symbolophorus sp. and Lepidophanes guentheri). However, the reason for the 

neglected condition does not seem to be related with sampling, maintenance or methodology. 

Ullmann et al. (2011) suggested that the number of cells in the retinal periphery may lead to an 

overestimation, due to the relatively thin retinal periphery and the radial cuts and shrinkage of the 

retina while treated for RGCs observation. As observed by Collin &amp;amp; Pettigrew (1989), difficulty in 

distinguish ACs from RGCs might be a problem, and it could lead to an overestimation of RGCs.  

Moreover, due to problems already mentioned, most retinas were damaged, which made 

difficult to identify and count RGCs, contributing to differences in results. The results obtained in 

this study differ from those obtained by de Busserolles (2013), most probably due to an observation 

bias that led to the overestimation of cells density values, especially for RGCs.
