SUMMARY

The assessment of soil quality is based on indicators and indices derived from

soil properties. However, intrinsic soil properties may interfere with other soil

properties that vary under different land uses and are used to calculate the indices.

The aim of this study was to assess the extent to which intrinsic soil properties

(clay and iron oxide contents) explain variable soil properties (sum of bases,

potential acidity, organic carbon, total porosity, and bulk density) under different

land uses (native forest, no-tillage and conventional agriculture) on small family

farms in Southern Brazil. The results showed that the five properties evaluated

can be included in soil quality assessments and are not influenced by the clay and

iron oxide contents. It was concluded that for little weathered 1:1 and 2:1

phyllosilicate rich-soils, if the difference between the maximum and the minimum

clay content under the different land uses is less than about 200 g kg-1 and the iron

oxide content less than about 15 g kg-1, the physico-chemical soil properties in the

surface layer are determined mostly by the land use.

Index terms: soil quality, family farms, ANCOVA, spurious correlation.

se com este estudo determinar a capacidade de propriedades intrínsecas do solo (teor de argila
e óxido de ferro) para explicar as propriedades variáveis (soma de bases, acidez potencial,
carbono orgânico, porosidade e densidade) em diferentes usos do solo (floresta nativa, plantio
direto e agricultura convencional) em pequenas propriedades familiares no sul do Brasil. Os
resultados evidenciaram que as cinco propriedades do solo estudadas podem ser incluídas em
avaliações de qualidade e não são influenciadas pelo teor de argila e óxido de ferro. Sugeriu-se
que, para solos pouco intemperizados, ricos em filossilicatos do tipo 1:1 e 2:1, se o teor de argila
estiver em um intervalo de aproximadamente 200 g kg-1 e o de óxido de ferro for menor que
aproximadamente 15 g kg-1, o uso do solo é o maior fator para controlar as propriedades físico-
químicas da camada superficial do solo.

INTRODUCTION

The clearing of natural vegetation for agriculture
leads to alterations in soil properties and, in several
cases, to environmental degradation (Bewket &amp;amp;
Stroonijdeb, 2003; Muniz et al., 2011). This
phenomenon calls for a concept of soil quality, which
is the capacity of a soil to function within the limits of
an ecosystem, interacting positively with the
environment external to that ecosystem (Larson &amp;amp;
Pierce, 1991). A soil with good quality fulfils a number
of functions (carbon storage, water reservoir, nutrient
cycling, growth medium, among others), while
simultaneously protecting other environmental
components and sustaining human health (Doran &amp;amp;
Parkin, 1994). In this sense, assessing the soil quality
is one of the main tasks of soil scientists (Basher,
1997).

However, in many regions there is still a lack of
studies on soil quality (Reichert et al., 2003). One of
these is the hillslope area of central Rio Grande do
Sul (RS), Brazil, with mostly small family farms.
These areas were first settled in the late XIX century
by European immigrants, when native vegetation was
replaced by agriculture. Today, farming is based on
the integration of crop and livestock. There is little
investment in machinery and fertilizers because of
the complex topography, thin soils, small property sizes
and low income of the farmers. On the other hand,
higher-income farms with deeper soils and better road
access adopted new and more intensive agricultural
practices and activities, requiring investments in
machinery and fertilizers. But soil conservation
practices are insufficient, characterizing
unsustainable agriculture and increasing the potential
of land degradation (Samuel-Rosa et al., 2011).

The soil quality assessment has to be based on the
use of indicators and indices that reflect soil processes,
integrate different soil properties and are sensitive to
environmental changes (Doran &amp;amp; Parkin, 1994). Many
soil properties can be included in such soil quality
indices (Larson &amp;amp; Pierce, 1991; Doran &amp;amp; Parkin,
1994; Islam &amp;amp; Weil, 2000; Geissen &amp;amp; Guzman, 2006;
Clemens et al., 2010). However, the heterogeneous
character of soils must also be taken into

consideration: intrinsic soil properties such as particle-
size distribution and the type and content of oxides
may vary among land uses. This variation can have
a pronounced effect on the soil properties used to
develop indices of soil quality (Miralles et al., 2009),
hampering the evaluation of the true effect of land
use. The aim of this study was to assess the extent to
which intrinsic soil properties (clay and iron oxide
contents) explain variable soil properties (sum of
bases, potential acidity, organic carbon, total porosity,
and bulk density) under different land uses (native
forest, no-tillage and conventional agriculture) on
small family farms in Southern Brazil.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

The data used in this study were measured on
small family farms in the hillslope areas of central
Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil. The local topography
is complex, with a relief ranging from undulated to
mountainous. The altitude varies between 240 and
450 m asl. The climate is classified as Cfa (humid
subtropical climate without a defined dry season), with
a mean annual temperature of 19.2 oC and mean
annual pluvial precipitation of 1,708 mm, quite well
distributed throughout the year (Maluf, 2000).
Geologically, the area consists predominantly of
igneous rocks. The natural vegetation (Atlantic semi-
deciduous forest) is dominated by Patagonula
americana, Parapiptadenia rigida, Myrocarpus
frondosus, Cordia trichotoma, Cedrela fissilis,
Apuleia leiocarpa and Luehea divaricata.

Three land uses were studied:

- native forest: nearly all areas under native forest
today had been used for agriculture in the past
century. European immigrants cleared the original
native forest in the late XIX century and practiced
conventional agriculture for several decades. Since the
1970s, areas with shallow (&lt;50 cm) and stony soils
were gradually abandoned, allowing the regrowth of
native vegetation;

- no-tillage: &gt;20 years of conventional agriculture -
cultivation of potato, Solanum tuberosum - followed

by 4 years of no-tillage - soybean, Glycine max, and
ryegrass, Lolium multiflorum;

- conventional agriculture: &gt;20 years of conventional
agriculture - mayze, Zea mays, and ryegrass.

The soils are little weathered. Leptosols prevail in
native forest and Acrisols in agricultural areas. The
mineralogical assemblage of both soil types is similar.
The soil clay mineral kaolinite (Kt), common in
Southern Brazil, is predominant (Kämpf &amp;amp; Klamt,
1978). Besides, other clay minerals were identified,
e.g., cristobalite, disordered kaolinite or halloysite
o r  b o t h ,  a n d  h y d r o x y - A l  i n t e r l a y e r e d  2 : 1
phyllosilicates (Kämpf &amp;amp; Klamt, 1978; Dalmolin et
al., 2006). There is evidence for the occurrence of a
small amount of hematite. The soils vary in texture
and differ significantly in clay and iron oxide
contents (Table 1).

Nine disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were
collected from two layers (0-10 and 10-20 cm) for each
land use, to determine the intrinsic soil properties
clay and iron oxide contents (Table 1). The clay content
was assessed by the pipette method (Kilmer &amp;amp;
Alexander, 1949), and total free iron oxide (FeDCB)
extracted by hot dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate (Mehra
&amp;amp; Jackson, 1960). The variable soil properties
potential acidity, sum of bases (sum of Ca2+, Mg2+ and
K+), organic carbon, bulk density, and porosity were
analyzed. Potential acidity (H+Al) was determined by
titration with NaOH after extraction with 0.5 mol L-1
Ca(CH3COO)2.H2O solution at pH 7.0-7.1; Ca2+ and
Mg2+ were quantified by atomic absorption after
1.0 mol L-1 KCl extraction; K+ was quantified by
f l a m e  a t o m i c  e m i s s i o n  s p e c t r o m e t r y  a f t e r

extraction with Mehlich-1 solution (Mehlich, 1953);
and organic carbon was determined by titration
with Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2.6H2O after wet digestion with
0.2 mol L-1 K2Cr2O7 solution (Yeomans &amp;amp; Bremner,
1988). All methods were described by Tedesco et
al. (1995) and Donagema et al. (2011).

Statistical analysis was performed in the R
environment (R Core Team, 2013) using frequency
histograms, cumulative frequency distribution
graphs, and the Cullen and Frey graph to test data
normality (Delignette-Muller et al., 2010; R Core
Team, 2013). The homogeneity of variances among
land uses was tested using box plots, standard
deviations and Bartlett’s Test (Bartlett, 1954;
Webster, 2001). The distribution of the intrinsic soil
properties was normal in both depth ranges. But for
some variable soil properties (potential acidity and
organic carbon in the upper, sum of bases in the lower
layer) skewed distribution and heteroscedasticity were
observed. Logarithmic transformation was used to
achieve normality and stabilize the variances. The
transformations altered the correlations between soil
properties. The differences between dependent
correlations (before and after transformation) were not
significant at 5 % probability of a type I error using
Williams’s Test (Steiger, 1980; Revelle, 2012). To test
the hypothesis that the intrinsic soil properties were
the same for all three land uses, we used ANOVA
(analysis of variance) and analyzed the results by
Fisher’s LSDs (least significant differences) for means
separation at a probability of 5 % of committing a
type I error (Fisher, 1951; Webster, 2007). To test the
effect of clay and iron oxide content on variable soil
properties, we used ANCOVA (analysis of covariance)

when the correlation between soil properties was
significant at 5 % probability of a type I error in the
Student’s t-tests (Revelle, 2012). The relation between
intrinsic and variable soil properties was also analyzed
using partial correlations (Revelle, 2012) and
scatterplots with a 95 % confidence interval of a linear
fit (Wickham, 2009; R Core Team, 2013). Tables and
plots are presented according to the latest
international recommendations for statistical results
in soil science (Webster, 2001; Webster, 2007). Soil
data and R scripts are freely available at&amp;lt;http://
www.soil-scientist.net&gt;.

RESULTS

The intrinsic soil properties were correlated with
the variable soil properties (Table 2). Potential acidity
is significantly correlated with clay and FeDCB in both
layers, but the correlation was strongest in the
subsurface. However, the partial correlation (r)
between potential acidity and FeDCB, when the clay
constant was fixed, r was only 0.252 in the surface
and 0.084 in the subsurface layer. Besides, the data
points were not evenly distributed in the 95 %
confidence interval of the mean in the scatterplots
(Figure 1), that is, they were stratified according to
the land use. Removing data of any land use
significantly altered the correlation between soil
properties. An exception is the correlation of clay with
potential acidity for the subsurface. The ANCOVA
table (Table 3) showed that the effect of FeDCB on
potential acidity was not significant. Clay also played
a minor role, accounting for no more than 5 % of the
total variance, while land use accounted for more than
80 % in both layers.

Sum of bases was negatively correlated with clay
and FeDCB content (Table 2). However, the partial
correlation of the sum of bases with FeDCB in the 0-10

cm layer at a fixed clay content was only r = -0.295.
In addition, data points were not evenly distributed
in the 95 % confidence interval of the mean in the
scatterplots (Figure 1). Again, removing data from
any land use significantly altered the correlation
between soil properties. The ANCOVA results
(Table 3) showed a minor effect of the clay content on
the sum of bases in the surface layer (10 % of the
total variance), and no effect in the subsurface layers.

Organic carbon correlated negatively with clay
content in the 0-10 cm layer and with FeDCB in the
10-20 cm layer (Table 2). However, data points were
stratified in the scatterplots according to land use
(Figure 1). The ANCOVA (Table 3) showed a minor
effect of clay on soil organic carbon, accounting for
less than 5 % of the total variance. Moreover, the effect
of FeDCB was not significant compared to the effect of
the land uses, which accounted for 80 % of the total
variance in the 0-10 cm layer and for 36 % in the 10-
20 cm layer.

Bulk density was positively correlated with clay
content in the surface layer (Table 2). However, some
degree of stratification of data points according to the
land use was identified in the scatterplot (Figure 1).
Besides, few data points were within the 95 %
confidence interval of the mean. The ANCOVA showed
that clay had no significant effect on soil bulk density
(Table 4). Land use accounted for more than 80 % of
the total variance.

Porosity was negatively correlated with clay
content (Table 2). In the scatterplot, we observed a
marked stratification of data points according to the
land use (Figure 1). Thus, removing data from any
land use significantly altered the correlations between
soil properties. The ANCOVA showed that clay did
not affect soil porosity and that land use accounted
for more than 85 % of the total variance (Table 4).

DISCUSSION

Scatterplots and ANCOVA were essential to identify
the true correlations between soil properties. The use
of correlation coefficients alone would have resulted
in a misinterpretation of the relations between soil
properties and led to an overestimation of the effect of
intrinsic soil properties. In this study, all correlations
were statistically significant, however not meaningful,
e.g., the correlation between clay content and sum of
bases. Phyllosilicate rich-soils, such as the Leptosols
and Acrisols studied here, are known to have a net
negative charge (Essington, 2004). In this case, a
positive correlation would be expected between sum
of bases and clay content. However, conversely, we
observed a spurious correlation. An accidental
correlation is one to which no “natural” causal
interpretation can be applied (Haig, 2003). In this
study, the spurious correlation observed was a result

of the accidental occurrence of the highest sum of bases
and lowest clay content in soils under no-tillage on the
one hand, and the lowest sum of bases and highest
clay content in soils under conventional agriculture on
the other hand. According to the land-use history, soils
under no-tillage are periodically treated with high
fertilization rates, while in soils under conventional
cultivation, only a small part of the nutrients exported
by crops is replaced. On the other hand, in soils under
native forest the sum of bases is slightly higher than
under conventional agriculture because there is no
export of nutrients. Besides, soils under native forest
are Leptosols, which means that the weathering was
less intense than of Acrisols, resulting in less leaching
of bases from the soil profile (Chesworth, 2008). Because
of all these relations, the variation in the sum of bases
in these soils is a result of the land-use history (and
maybe soil type). Clay and iron oxide content have no
major influence, suggesting that they are not relevant
in the assessment of soil quality.

The correlation of intrinsic soil properties with
organic carbon, bulk density and porosity were
accidental as well. It is known that clay and iron oxides
can play a positive role in organic carbon accumulation
in soils (Dalmolin et al., 2006). We also expected a
negative correlation of clay content with bulk density,
in the same way as lower clay contents reduce soil
porosity (Michelon et al., 2007). However, the correlation
in the studied soils was opposite to the one expected.
Similarly to the trend of the sum of bases, the variation
observed in organic carbon, bulk density and porosity
was mainly affected by the land-use history.

Only the correlation between intrinsic soil
properties and potential acidity was as expected (Tan,
2010). However, despite the statistically significant
correlations, ANCOVA showed that clay content had
only a minor effect on potential acidity and that FeDCB
had none. The land use had the greatest effect on the
potential acidity in both layers, as evidenced by the

stratification of the points in the scatterplots. Once
again there was an accidental correlation, where soils
with lower clay content were under a land use (no-
tillage) that reduced potential acidity. The soils under
no-tillage were periodically limed. On the other hand,
soils with higher clay content were under a land use
(conventional agriculture) that induced the degradation
of soil fertility. Under conventional agriculture, the soil
was limed more than four years before sampling. In
turn, soils under native forest were not fertilized or
limed and consequently organic matter is the
component with the greatest impact on availability of
exchangeable aluminium (Silva et al., 2008) and thus
on potential acidity. Since these soils have higher
organic carbon content than soils under conventional
agriculture, the potential acidity will be lower.

Our results showed that under the tested
conditions, soil properties important for land use such
as potential acidity, sum of bases, organic carbon, bulk
density, and porosity are affected by the land use. They
are efficient in reflecting land use and are little affected
by intrinsic soil properties such as clay and iron oxide
content, suggesting that they can be included in soil
quality assessments. Our data also indicated that
despite statistically significant differences in clay and
iron oxide content among soils, these soil properties
have no effect on the results of soil quality
assessments. Webster (2001) previously stated that
when a difference is considered statistically
significant, it is not necessarily important or
physically or biologically meaningful. Our findings
and those of many other researchers agree with this
statement. Mandal et al. (2010) studied Himalayan
Entisols and Inceptisols with clay contents between
106 and 172 g kg-1 and found that soil management
strongly influenced the soil quality indicators. Marzaioli
et al. (2010) studied sandy loam and loam sandy
Mediterranean soils (clay content 54 - 171 g kg-1) and
also observed that any differences in soil quality could
be attributed to differences in land use. Similar results
were found by Schipper et al. (2010), who expected to
find fewer changes in organic carbon after 40 years
in Andisols in New Zealand than in other soil orders
due to the remarkable capacity of allophane and
imogolite to sequester and protect organic carbon
(Parfitt, 2009). Miralles et al. (2009) found that clay
and iron oxide contents in soil samples of Leptosols,
Calcisols, Vertisols, Luvisols, Kastanozems, and
Chernozems (clay content between 219 and 483 g kg-1
and FeDCB content between 4.4 and 14.1 g kg-1)
were weakly correlated with organic carbon (r &amp;lt;0.26,
p = 0.05, n = 68). Percival et al. (2000) studied New
Zealand soils (Andisols, Inceptisols, Ultisols,
Mollisols, Oxisols, Alfisols, Spodosols, Entisols,
Aridisols, and Ultisols) with clay contents from
38 g kg-1 to 329 g kg-1 and found that carbon contents
correlated poorly with clay content across and within
soil orders. According to the authors, the clay content
accounted for only 1 % of the variation in carbon
content in both cases.

However, several studies have shown that intrinsic
soil properties can control the expression of other soil
properties. In the above-mentioned study, Miralles et
al. (2009) observed a strong correlation of clay and
iron oxide content with cation exchange capacity,
porosity and bulk density. Likewise, Dieckow et al.
(2009) compared a clay Ferralsol (clay: 711 g kg-1;
FeDCB: 87.6 g kg-1), a sandy clay Ferralsol (clay: 360 g
kg-1; FeDCB: 48.3 g kg-1) and a sandy clay loam Acrisol
(clay: 220 g kg-1; FeDCB: 11.8 g kg-1) and observed that
clay and iron oxide contents were strongly correlated
with organic carbon. According to Dieckow et al.
(2009), in terms of organic carbon losses, the
conversion of native vegetation to cropland is less
harmful in clayey than in sandy soils, possibly
because of a chemical and physical protection.

The inconsistency of the findings of different
researchers shows the need for further research on
the role of intrinsic soil properties in the control of
the effect of land uses on soil properties included in
soil quality assessments. Meanwhile, we can suggest
that textural classes should not be used as isolated
tools to describe the heterogeneous character of soils
and to explain the effects of intrinsic soil properties on
other chemical and physical soil properties. Our study
shows that despite the soil classification in different
texture classes, the clay content has no apparent effect
on other chemical and physical properties. Whenever
possible, the information on intrinsic soil properties
should be used as a continuous (clay content) and not
as a discrete variable (textural class). Therefore,
ANCOVA becomes highly relevant in the assessment
of the extent to which chemical and physical soil
properties can be explained by intrinsic soil properties
under different land uses and thus affect soil quality
assessments. Future studies must focus on the
identification and definition of clay and iron oxide
content ranges and other oxides in soils that affect
the behavior of soil chemical and physical properties
used in soil quality assessments in different ways.

Finally, a general recommendation for studies on
little weathered 1:1 and 2:1 phyllosilicate rich-soils
with a similar mineralogy as in the soils of this study.
If the difference between the maximum and the
minimum clay content under different land uses is
less than about 200 g kg-1 and the iron oxide content
less than approximately 15 g kg-1, the physico-
chemical soil properties in the surface layer (0-20 cm)
are determined mostly by the land use and history.
The effect of intrinsic soil properties is negligible and
only detectable in deeper layers (&gt;20 cm), where
management practices have less effect.

CONCLUSIONS

1. Organic carbon content, sum of bases, potential
acidity, bulk density and porosity are easy measureable
soil properties, reflect the land use and are little

affected by intrinsic soil properties (clay and iron
oxides). This suggests that they can be included in
the assessment of the soil quality on small family
farms.

2. Despite the classification of soils in different
texture classes, intrinsic soil properties (clay and iron
oxide contents) may have no effect on other chemical
and physical soil properties. Whenever possible,
information on intrinsic soil properties in soil quality
assessments should be used as continuous rather than
as discrete variables.

3. For little weathered 1:1 and 2:1 phyllosilicate
rich-soils, if the difference between the maximum and
the minimum clay content under different land uses
is less than about 200 g kg-1 and the iron oxide content
less than about 15 g kg-1, the physico-chemical soil
properties in the surface layer are determined mostly
by the land use.
