Abstract

The aquatic habitats of the Taquari-Antas river basin (in the Patos Lagoon basin, southern Brazil) are under marked 
environmental transformation because of river damming for hydropower production. In order to provide an information 
baseline on the fish fauna of the Taquari-Antas basin, we provide a comprehensive survey of fish species based on 
primary and secondary data. We found 5,299 valid records of fish species in the basin, representing 119 species and 
519 sampling sites. There are 13 non-native species, six of which are native to other Neotropical river basins. About 
24% of the total native species are still lacking a taxonomic description at the species level. Three native long-distance 
migratory species were recorded (Leporinus obtusidens, Prochilodus lineatus, Salminus brasiliensis), as well as two 
potential mid-distance migrators (Parapimelodus nigribarbis and Pimelodus pintado). Although there is only one 
officially endangered species in the basin (S. brasiliensis), restricted range species (21.7% of total species) should be 
considered in conservation efforts.

Peixes da bacia do rio Taquari-Antas (sistema da Laguna dos Patos), sul do Brasil

Resumo

Os ambientes aquáticos da Bacia do rio Taquari-Antas (Bacia da Laguna dos Patos, sul do Brasil) vêm sofrendo 
considerável transformação, principalmente em razão da implantação de barragens para geração de energia elétrica. 
Com o objetivo de estabelecer um diagnóstico amplo da ictiofauna da Bacia do Taquari-Antas, realizou-se um 
inventário das espécies dessa bacia a partir de dados primários e secundários. Foram obtidos 5.299 registros válidos de 
espécies de peixe na bacia, representando 119 espécies e 519 localidades amostradas. Ocorrem, na bacia, 13 espécies 
não nativas, seis das quais são oriundas de outras bacias neotropicais. Cerca de 24% de todas as espécies carecem 
de descrição taxonômica no nível específico. Foram registradas três espécies nativas migradoras de longa distância 
(Leporinus obtusidens, Prochilodus lineatus e Salminus brasiliensis) e duas potenciais migradoras de média distância 
(Parapimelodus nigribarbis e Pimelodus pintado). O fato de uma espécie ser oficialmente reconhecida como ameaçada 
na bacia (S. brasiliensis) e a grande proporção de espécies de distribuição restrita (21,7% do total) devem ser levados 
em consideração nos esforços de conservação.

1. Introduction

The Brazilian freshwater fish fauna is extremely diverse, 
with more than 2,500 valid species distributed through 
several habitat types and river systems, and there is a growing 
number of new species being described (Buckup et al., 
2007). However, river basins in Brazil are becoming 
increasingly transformed by human activities, particularly 

in the southeastern and southern regions, where land use 
change, pollution and damming for hydroelectricity are the 
main factors affecting fish conservation (Agostinho et al., 
2008; Barletta et al., 2010). This continuous process of 
environmental change threatens the existence of fish species 
and their habitats, therefore conservation planning and

prioritization require information on species composition 
and distribution in relatively large areas. In Brazil, surveys 
for improving the knowledge base on freshwater fishes 
are frequently called for (Vari and Malabarba, 1998; 
Agostinho et al., 2005, 2008; Buckup et al., 2007).

In this paper, we present the results of a fish species 
survey in the Taquari-Antas river basin (26.470 km2), in 
southern Brazil. This region has been historically affected by 
urban, industrial and agricultural activities, although there 
are several relatively less affected areas of Atlantic forest 
and natural grasslands. In the early 2000s, river damming 
for hydropower generation became an additional cause of 
environmental transformation. By the end of 2010, there 
were 26 hydroelectric power plants (from&amp;lt;1 MW to 130 
MW) in operation or under construction in the Taquari-
Antas basin, with more than 80 sites under examination 
for potentially new dams (data from the Rio Grande do Sul 
State Foundation for Environment Protection – FEPAM, 
and from the Brazilian electric power authority database, 
ANEEL/SIGEL). In the lower Taquari river there is also 
a canal lock for navigation, which can be considered the 
first obstacle for upstream fish migration.

In spite of a relatively large number of recent taxonomic 
studies and fish sampling across the Taquari-Antas basin, 
a consolidated overview of the fish species composition 
and distribution is lacking. Studies providing a wider 
perspective of the Taquari-Antas fishes were only recently 
published (Malabarba et al., 2009; Luz-Agostinho et al., 
2010), however their scope was limited to specific regions 
within the watershed. Malabarba et al. (2009) surveyed 
the fishes from the high basaltic plateau, including the 
headwaters of the Taquari-Antas and Caí rivers (both in 
the Patos Lagoon basin) and of Pelotas and Canoas rivers 
(upper Uruguay river basin). They found 46 species and a 

high degree of endemism for fishes of the Jacuí headwaters 
(21.7%), which include the Taquari-Antas headwaters. 
Luz-Agostinho et al. (2010) found 70 species in the mid-
stretch of the Taquari-Antas and several tributaries, and 
also report baseline information on the reproduction and 
feeding of several species.

Our main objective is to present a comprehensive 
survey of the fish species of the Taquari-Antas basin. We 
used primary data from our own field collections, but also 
compiled a large amount of secondary data, including samples 
from several different habitats. In particular, we aimed at 
producing a species list that is the best approximation of the 
actual species composition in the studied area, and where 
taxonomic consistence and uncertainties are objectively 
pointed out. We also assessed the fish fauna in terms of 
non-native species, conservation status, general spatial 
distribution patterns, species with restricted geographical 
distribution, and migratory species.

2. Material and Methods

2.1. Study area

The Taquari-Antas basin is situated in southern Brazil 
(state of Rio Grande do Sul) and is one of the main sub-
basins of the Patos Lagoon basin (Figure 1), which is a large 
drainage flowing into the Atlantic Ocean and is one of the 
freshwater ecoregions recognized by Abell et al. (2008). 
It is a 7th order river basin (Strahler, 1957; stream network 
map at 1:250.000 scale) with a total area of 26.470 km2. 
The Antas river, as the main river is called in the upper 
section of the basin, flows from a high basaltic plateau 
(ca. 800 to 1200 m a.s.l) through deeply incised valleys 
until the lowlands, where it is known as Taquari river.

The lowlands flow through terrains formed by alluvial 
deposits in elevations between 20 m to 100 m a.s.l. The 
main river channel, from headwaters to the confluence 
with Jacuí river, is ca. 400 km long and the mean annual 
flow is 606 m3.s-1 (Rio Grande do Sul, 2007).

2.2. Species records

We determined the fish species of the Taquari-Antas 
basin from primary and secondary data. Primary data were 
obtained by sampling fish assemblages at several localities 
across the study area during 2010. Secondary data were 
obtained by reviewing and validating records from the 
largest and most regionally representative fish collections 
(Museu de Ciências Naturais da Fundação Zoobotânica do 
Rio Grande do Sul, MCN; Museu de Ciências e Tecnologia 
da Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul, 
MCP; Department of Zoology of Universidade Federal do 
Rio Grande do Sul, UFRGS). Additionally, we reviewed 
species records from scientific publications and technical 
environmental reports available at FEPAM.

The fish records compiled comprise samples obtained 
by several different fishing techniques (gill nets, seine nets, 
cast nets, dip nets and electrofishing) and encompassed 
several habitat types (small streams to large rivers, reservoirs 
and small wetlands).

2.3. Geographical coordinates of species records

After compiling the fish record database for the whole 
Taquari-Antas basin, we found three types of geographic 
location data: (a) descriptions of the sampling site geographic 
location without geographic coordinates (found mostly in 
museum records and in bibliographic sources), (b) geographic 
coordinates that had been obtained in the field, using GPS 
receivers and (c) geographic coordinates from unknown 
sources. In the first case, we approximated geographic 
coordinates on the basis of the site descriptions or site 
locations pictured in maps included in the bibliographic 
sources, using a geographic information system ArcGis 
(ESRI) and the digital version of the official 1:50.000 
cartographic database of Rio Grande do Sul (Hasenack 
and Weber, 2010). This cartographic database includes the 
stream network, roads, cities and detailed toponymy, and 
is usually used by researchers for field navigation and for 
describing sampling site locations. Information about the 
datum associated with geographic coordinates was rare in 
the database, therefore we assumed WGS84 for all records.

2.4. Taxonomic validation

Fish samples collected by the authors were identified 
or validated by taxonomy specialists. Voucher specimens 
of all species can be found in at least one of the reviewed 
museum collections (MCN, MCP, UFRGS). Species 
records from secondary sources (museum databases and 
non-taxonomic bibliographic sources) have been subject 
to nomenclature actualization (e.g., Astyanax alburnus 
to Cyanocharax alburnus, cf. Malabarba and Weitzman, 
2003; Pimelodus maculatus to Pimelodus pintado, cf. 
Azpelicueta et al., 2008). Museum specimens were 
examined only when the actual presence of a species in 
the Taquari-Antas basin depended exclusively on the valid 
identification of a particular sample. We did not consider 
as valid any record with dubious taxonomic identification 
and that could not be validated by examining vouchers 

specimens in scientific collections. We also excluded 
any record with a geographic location that could not be 
unequivocally determined to be within the Taquari-Antas 
basin. The taxonomic classification follows Reis et al. 
(2003a), except for the use of Labriformes (Wiley and 
Johnson, 2010).

We assessed the species conservation status according 
to the endangered species list of Rio Grande do Sul 
(Reis et al., 2003b) and the Brazilian list of endangered 
fish species (Instrução Normativa do Ministério do Meio 
Ambiente nº 05, 21 de maio de 2004). To determine species 
with restricted geographical ranges (&lt;10.000 km2 sensu 
Nogueira et al., 2010), we used data from our survey and 
primary literature, rather than assuming a priori only the 
species listed by Nogueira et al. (2010). We considered as 
migratory those species mentioned by Luz-Agostinho et al. 
(2010). Any species whose natural distribution does not 
include the Patos Lagoon basin was considered as non-
native. We also described the general distribution pattern 
of species across the main geomorphological sections 
of the Taquari-Antas basin (Lowlands, Mid-slopes, and 
Plateau). Species were classified as typical of a section 
when &gt;70% of their records were included in only one 
section. Species occurring in all sections and with more 
than 30% records in at least two sections were considered 
to be well distributed across the Taquari-Antas basin.

3. Results

We obtained 5,299 valid presence records of fish 
species in the Taquari-Antas basin, representing 119 species 
(including non-native species; Table 1) and 519 sampling 
sites (Figure 2). The total number of species (119) was 
determined only after a validation process on a preliminary 
listing of 266 nominal taxa obtained from the secondary 
data. Most sampling sites (43.3%) were located in higher 
elevation areas of the plateau, while the remaining were 
situated in the slopes between the lowlands and the plateau 
(32%) and in the lowlands (24.7%) (Figure 2).

There were records for 13 non-native species (10.9% 
of the total number of species), six of which are native 
to other Neotropical river basins (Table 2). About 25% 
of the total native species are still lacking a taxonomic 
description at the species level. Several of the recorded 
species have a relatively limited geographical distribution 
(Table 2), including only the Taquari-Antas basin, or 
the Taquari-Antas and adjacent neighboring watersheds 
(Upper Uruguay, Sinos, and Caí river, and the headwaters 
of small coastal watersheds). Only Salminus brasiliensis is 
officially listed as a threatened species (Reis et al., 2003b).

At least six migratory species were recorded in the 
Taquari-Antas basin: the long distance migrants Leporinus 
obtusidens, Prochilodus lineatus, Salminus brasiliensis, 
the mid-distance migrants Parapimelodus nigribarbis and 
Pimelodus pintado, and the non-native Acestrorhynchus 
pantaneiro. The migratory species were represented by few 
locality records (except for Pimelodus pintado, Figure 3), 
and were mostly limited to the mid- and lower sections of 
the rivers, downstream the Cachoeirão rapids, except for 
one record of Leporinus obtusidens at the Tainhas river 
(see Figure 3). Pimelodus pintado was the most widely 
distributed migratory species with several records upstream 
the Cachoeirão and in upper parts of the main tributaries 
of the Antas river (Prata, Carreiro and Guaporé rivers).

The number of species in the Taquari-Antas basin 
represents ca. 65% of the total number of known species 
for the Patos Lagoon basin (160 species, including 
35 undescribed species; Malabarba et al., 2009). The 
number of native species in physiographically similar and 
geographically close river basins varies from 51 (Pardinho 
river, Patos Lagoon basin; Ribeiro and Köhler, 2007) to 
79 (Maquiné river, in the Tramandaí river system; F. G. 
Becker, unpublished data) and 89 (Sinos river, Patos Lagoon 
basin; Leal et al., 2009). However, a proper comparison 
is not possible because these studies used distinct survey 
methods and because the studied watersheds vary in total 
area and ecological integrity.

The proportion of undescribed species in the Taquari-
Antas is relatively large (23.6%) and similar to estimates for 
the whole Patos Lagoon and Uruguay river basins (21.9% 
and 22.2%, respectively; Malabarba et al., 2009). It is 
particularly important to note that part of these undescribed 
species are small headwater fish (e.g. Eurycheilichthys 
and Trichomycterus), with potentially small geographic 
ranges, reinforcing the previous observations of a highly 
underestimated diversity in the region (Malabarba et al., 
2009). As noted by Ferrer and Malabarba (2011), all the 
highly endemic species described to the basaltic highlands 
(which include the Taquari-Antas mid-slope rivers and 

The fish fauna of the Taquari-Antas presents a relatively 
clear distribution pattern across the three geomorphological 
sections of the basin (Figure 4). Most species (58%) are 
typically distributed in lowland rivers and streams, but 
about half of these species had at least a few records 
(&lt;30% of total specific records) in the Mid-slope valleys 
and in the Plateau. A typical fish fauna is also found 
in the Plateau (20% of total native species), including 
16 species for which all records were located in this 
geomorphological section. In the transition between 
the Plateau and the Lowlands - i.e., the Mid-slopes 
section - there is an overlap in the distribution of lowland 
species and headwater species, with few typical species 
(9.5% of total species). Only 12.4% of all native species 
were relatively common in the three geomorphological 
sections (e.g., Bryconamericus iheringii, Characidium 
pterostictum, Geophagus brasiliensis, Gymnotus aff. carapo, 
Hyphessobrycon luetkenii, Phalloceros caudimaculatus).

4. Discussion

According to our survey, knowledge about the fishes 
of the Taquari-Antas basin was relatively poor until the 
late 1990s, and consisted of several records in museum 
databases (the oldest record in the examined collections 
dates from 1977; 62% of the collection records were 
sampled after 1999), and descriptions of species with 
geographical distributions that included the region (e.g., 
Malabarba, 1989; Buckup, 1993; Malabarba and Mahler 
Junior, 1998; Cardoso and Malabarba, 1999). In the late 
1990s, fish sampling was intensified as part of baseline 
studies for environmental impact assessments (EIA), which 
are demanded by the State and Federal environmental 
agencies (FEPAM and IBAMA) in Brazil. Vouchers of 
most of these samples are now kept in the fish collections of

headwater streams) have been discovered and described in 
the last 20 years. It is also interesting that some undescribed 
species of Astyanax are widely distributed across adjacent 
river basins, but at least two are potentially endemic to 
areas within the Taquari-Antas basin.

The main distribution of the migratory species in the 
Antas river seems to be limited upstream by the strong 
rapids known as “Cachoeirão”, as previously noted by 
Luz-Agostinho et al. (2010). However, these species 
were represented by few records in our survey (except for 
P. pintado) and were not effectively sampled before the 
construction of the main dams in the Antas river (14 de 
Julho, Monte Claro and Castro Alves, in the early 2000s; 
Figure 3). The “dourado”, Salminus brasiliensis, probably 
used to be present in upper reaches of the basin, as suggested 
by occurrence data determined by Alves and Fontoura (2009) 
from interviews with fishermen. The migratory status of 
Pimelodus pintado is still not well established (Alves and 
Fontoura, 2009), but its reproductive behavior could be 
similar to Pimelodus maculatus. The latter species migrates 
for long-distances, but is abundant in serially impounded 
rivers, as the Tietê and Grande rivers (Agostinho et al., 
2007), probably being able to reproduce in shorter free 
river stretches (Agostinho et al., 2003).

We registered a high proportion of species with small 
geographical ranges (ca. 10000 km2 in range, following 
Nogueira et al., 2010), either endemic to the Taquari-Antas 
basin or not (Table 2). These numbers were based on 
recent publications (see Table 1) and on-going taxonomic 
investigations (J. Ferrer; V. A. Bertaco; R. E. Reis), and add 
another 11 species to those already listed by Nogueira et al. 
(2010). Most of these species occur in the upper portions of 
the basin (only in the Plateau or also in the Mid-slopes and 
valleys), as Eurycheilichthys spp. and Trichomycterus spp.. 
At least one species is known only from its type locality 
(Bryconamericus ecai, Silva, 2004) despite the extensive 
sampling in the basin. Because restricted range species 
are potentially more susceptible to environmental impacts 
and to extinction, they should be considered as targets for 
assessments in conservation planning and environmental 
licensing. This is particularly relevant in the Taquari-

Antas basin, in face of the high potential for increase in 
the number of dams for hydroelectric power production 
and for land transformation (forestry and agriculture) in 
the upper sections of the basin.

The non-native species represented a relevant proportion 
(10.9%) of the total species registered in the basin, however 
information on their abundance, population dynamics 
and on their impacts on the native biota is still lacking. 
About half of the non-native species are original from 
non-Neotropical regions; some of these were introduced 
in fish ponds for aquaculture production and escaped 
into natural habitats (e.g. Cyprinus carpio, Ictalurus 
punctatus and Oreochromis niloticus), while others were 
released directly into streams and rivers for sport fishing 
(the black bass, Micropterus salmoides, and the rainbow 
trout, Onchorynchus mykiss, particularly in streams of the 
basaltic plateau). Results from a fish monitoring program 
with extensive sampling between 2002-2009 indicated that 
non-native species occur only in low abundances in the 
mid-lower Taquari-Antas, and evidence for reproductive 
populations has been indirectly suggested only for C. carpio 
(Luz-Agostinho et al., 2010). Some of the Neotropical 
non-natives were probably unintentionally introduced 
via inter-basin man-made connections resulting from land 
management for agriculture (rice fields), and eventually 
dispersed rapidly and reached high abundances in different 
parts of the Patos Lagoon basin (e.g. Pachyurus bonariensis 
and Trachelyopterus lucenai, see Becker, 2002; Saccol-
Pereira et al., 2006; Becker et al., 2007; Dufech and Fialho, 
2007). We found museum records (MCP) for Tilapia 
rendalli collected in fish ponds in the late 1970s, however 
there was no record of this species in natural waters at the 
Taquari-Antas basin.

Considering the results of the present inventory, 
conservation in the Taquari-Antas basin should consider 
at least the following three components of the fish fauna. 
One aspect is to protect habitat for migratory fish (including 
the endangered Salminus brasiliensis), which can only be 
accomplished if some rivers receive no more dams. An 
example is the Guaporé river, which seems to function as 
an alternative reproductive area after the damming of the 
Taquari-Antas river (Luz-Agostinho et al., 2010). A second 
point is the protection or restoration of streams and rivers 
containing restricted range and endemic species, which 
requires an effort for formal description of these species 
and their geographical ranges. The third point is taking 
action to prevent the escapement of non-native species from 
fish ponds or their deliberate in natural waters, particularly 
where restricted range and endemic species are present.
