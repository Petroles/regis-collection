RESUMO

Em sistemas de combustão tais como fornos para tratamento térmico, geradores de vapor,

câmaras de motores e flares na indústria de petróleo, a radiação térmica é o mecanismo

de transferência de calor predominante devido à presença de gases, fuligem e partículas

em altas temperaturas. O cálculo da radiação térmica em gases participantes, tais como

H2O e CO2, é uma tarefa complexa devido à forte dependência de suas propriedades

radiativas com o número de onda. A solução `exata' linha-por-linha (LBL) é a alternativa

mais precisa. No entanto, esta metodologia requer um alto esforço computacional, o qual

não é factível para soluções de problemas práticos de engenharia. Modelos Globais tais

como a Soma-Ponderada-de-Gases-Cinza (WSGG) e a Soma-Ponderada-de-Gases-Cinza

baseada em linhas espectrais (SLW) são alternativas promissoras. O modelo WSGG,

apesar de sua formulação relativamente simples, fornece resultados próximos à integração

LBL, assim como o modelo SLW, normalmente reconhecido como uma evolução do modelo

WSGG. Desse modo, neste trabalho foi realizada a comparação entre a precisão do modelo

WSGG e a do SLW. Para tanto, foram obtidas soluções para H2O, CO2 e misturas de

H2O/CO2 em meios não isotérmicos homogêneos e não homogêneos. Para misturas, no

modelo WSGG também foi utilizado o método da sobreposição, o qual faz parte da

modelagem de misturas do modelo SLW. A abordagem da sobreposição surge como uma

alternativa para o tratamento de meios não homogêneos. No entanto, o desa?o deste

método é a combinação de espécies participantes uma vez que isto requer um aumento no

esforço computacional com o aumento do número de componentes. A partir disto, este

trabalho propõe e aplica um método da sobreposição reduzido para o modelo WSGG, com

o intuito de reduzir o tempo computacional. Além disso, é veri?cada a consistência desta

proposta em chamas difusivas. Os resultados mostram que o modelo WSGG pode levar a

resultados tão bons quanto os do modelo SLW dependendo do problema analisado. Ainda,

o método da sobreposição reduzido forneceu uma precisão muito próxima à do método da

sobreposição padrão.

ABSTRACT

In combustion systems such as gas furnaces for thermal processing, steam generators, en-

gine chambers and ?ares in the petroleum industry, the thermal radiation is the dominant

heat transfer mechanism due to the presence of participating gases, soot and particulates

at high temperatures. The thermal radiation computation in participating gases, such as

H2O and CO2, is a complex task due to the strong dependence of its radiative properties

on the wavenumber. The `exact' Line-by-Line (LBL) calculation is the most accurate

alternative. However, this methodology requires a very expensive computational e?ort,

which is not feasible for practical engineering problems solution. Global Models such

as the Weighted-Sum-of-Gray-Gases (WSGG) and the Spectral-Line Weighted-Sum-of-

Gray-Gases (SLW) are promising alternatives. The WSGG model, despite its relatively

simple formulation, has provided results near to LBL integration as well as the SLW

model, often recognized as a WSGG model improvement. Thus, in this work a compar-

ison between the accuracy of the WSGG and SLW models was made. Therefore, were

obtained solutions for H2O, CO2, and H2O/CO2 mixtures in non-isothermal homoge-

neous and non-homogeneous media. For mixtures, in the WSGG model was also used

the superposition method, which makes part of SLW mixture modeling. The superposi-

tion approach arises as an alternative to non-homogeneous media treatment. However,

the challenge of this approach is the combination of participating gases since it requires

increasing computational e?ort as the components number increase. Thereby, this work

proposes and applies a reduced superposition method for the WSGG model aiming for

computational time reduction. In addition, the consistency of this proposition is also

veri?ed in di?usion ?ames. The results show that the WSGG model can lead to results

as good as those of SLW depending on the problem under analysis. Further, the reduced

superposition method provided accuracy very near to that of the standard superposition

method.

1 INTRODUCTION

Several engineering processes need to operate in elevated temperatures. In com-

bustion systems, for instance, the participating gases temperature may reach above 2500

K. In such conditions, the thermal radiation is the prevalent heat transfer mechanism. De-

spite this fact, the accurate thermal radiation modeling in combustion systems has being

ignored in many cases and treated with simplistic optically thin and gray models [Modest

and Haworth, 2016]. The main reason for that may be the di?culty of including accurate

radiative transfer calculation in problems already complex. However, simply neglecting

the thermal radiation in atmospheric pressure combustion systems may overpredict the

temperature up to 200 ?C, while using the optically thin or gray radiation models un-

derpredict up to 100 ?C [Modest and Haworth, 2016]. Due to this, many works have

been developed presenting di?erent methodologies for the thermal radiation modeling in

participating gases, as will be described in Chapter 2.

In participating media, when a gas molecule absorbs or emits radiative energy,

the vibrational and/or rotational energies of the molecule are raised or lowered. These

energy levels lead to many thousands of discrete spectral lines, forming so-called vibra-

tion?rotation bands. The photon energy needed to the transition levels are a?ected by

some physical mechanisms which makes the line to be broadened. The main mechanisms

are the molecular collisions and the molecular movement (Doppler e?ect). In a certain

spectral location, a spectral line is described by its strength and its line width. These

informations are found in conceited databases, such as HITRAN and HITEMP. In these

databases is also found the information of how to calculate the resulting absorption co-

e?cient, necessary in the radiative transfer equation (RTE) solution. The absorption

coe?cient is characterized by thousands of absorption lines having a very erratic behavior

with wavenumber, which makes the analysis complicated. Such behavior is illustrated in

Figure 1.1, where the spectral absorption coe?cient, ??, is plotted against the wavenum-

ber ? for a small concentration of H2O (YH2O = 0.01), at a temperature of 1500 K and

total pressure of 1 atm. There are some approaches focused on capturing this spectral

dependence of the absorption coe?cient. The Line-by-Line (LBL) spectral integration

solve the RTE for wavenumber intervals small enough to capture the data exactly. The

challenge of this method is the high computational time needed in this calculation. On the



2

other hand, the gray approach removes the spectral dependence of the absorption coe?-

cient by calculating an average value for all wavenumbers. Despite the less computational

e?ort required, this approach lead to elevated errors.

Figure 1.1 ? The absorption coe?cient, ??, as a function of wavenumber ?, for H2O at T

= 1500 K, p = 1 atm, YH2O = 0.01, and for wavenumbers ranging from 0 to 10,000 cm
?1

[Pearson, 2013].

Between these two extremists approaches there are the Global Models. These meth-

ods propose a integration scheme over the absorption coe?cient rather than wavenumber.

Thus, it renders fewer than 20 RTE integrations with an accuracy near to that of LBL.

The WSGG and the SLW models are among the most promising Global Models. The

WSGG model, initially developed by Hottel and Saro?m, 1967, in despite of its simple

formulation yields satisfactory accuracy, solving the RTE with a summation over just

3 or 4 gray gases instead of spectral integration. While the SLW model [Denison and

Webb, 1993b] was developed in 1990's, and has received several improvements since its

initial proposition for the treatment of non-isothermal and/or non-homogeneous media.

Therefore, this model is more sophisticated than WSGG, utilizing 10 or even 20 gray

gases. For participating gases mixtures, the limitation of WSGG is that its correlations

are given for constant partial pressure ratio between the species in non-homogeneous me-

dia. This problem is removed with the superposition method [Cassol et al., 2014], based



3

on individual gases correlations, which also makes part of SLW mixture formulation. Even

though the SLW model be considered an improvement of WSGG, the di?erence between

the solutions of these models may not be substantial depending on the case under anal-

ysis. Furthermore, one important issue of the superposition method is that the number

of times that the RTE must be solved increases signi?cantly as the species number also

increases.

1.1 Objectives of the study

The general objective of this study is to apply the WSGG and SLW models for

radiative transfer prediction in participating media. From that, the following speci?c

objectives can be de?ned:

• Compute the thermal radiation in non-isothermal homogeneous and non-homogeneous

media using both WSGG and SLW models. The results will be compared against

LBL benchmark solutions in order to verify the accuracy of these models. The

problems will be solved for H2O and CO2 individually, and for H2O/CO2 mixtures,

considering di?erent pro?les of temperature and molar concentration of the species.

For mixtures, the superposition method will be applied to the WSGG to do an

adequate comparison with SLW solution;

• Proposition and application of a reduced superposition method in the WSGG model,

aiming at a computational time reduction. In the superposition method the num-

ber of times that the RTE must be solved is expressively raised as the participating

species number increases. In combustion systems where the radiative transfer cal-

culation is only part of a complex problem, which includes chemical kinetic and

turbulence modeling, any computational time reduction is very important.

• Verify the consistency of the reduced superposition method in di?usion ?ames.

1.2 Organization of the Work

Chapter 2 will present a literature review for the main methods developed for

spectral integration of the RTE. Chapter 3 will provide a description of the thermal

radiation fundamental relevant for this work, focusing on those important for the de?nition



4

and solution of the RTE. The detailed description of the spectral integration methods used

in this study will be shown in Chapter 4. A new approach for the superposition method

applied to the WSGG model will be described in Chapter 5. This proposition aims at the

computational e?ort reduction. Chapter 6 will show the application of WSGG and SLW

models for the radiative transfer prediction in participating media. The validation of the

new approach for the superposition method will also be presented. Chapter 7 will give

conclusions and perspectives for future works. Some results of the radiative transfer from

participating gases are also included in the appendices.

2 BIBLIOGRAPHY SURVEY

At high temperatures, thermal radiation can signi?cantly a?ect the heat transfer

characteristics in media involving combustion products. However, the prediction of the

radiative heat transfer is still a challenging task due to the strong spectral variation of the

absorption coe?cient of gases with the wavenumber. The line-by-line (LBL) integration

can provide a solution with high level of accuracy for this kind of problem, but, due to

the many thousands of absorption lines present in gases spectra, LBL calculations are

computationally expensive [Denison and Webb, 1995a], which often makes the solution

impracticable. As an alternative to overcome this di?culty, some gas models have been

developed.

2.1 Radiative Transfer Modeling

The Gray Gas (GG) model is the simplest method to predict the radiative heat

transfer in combustion systems and atmosphere processes. This approach consists in

considering the radiative properties, as the absorption coe?cient, to be independent of

the wavenumber. Despite this unrealistic approximation for gases, the GG model is yet

used in modern engineering problem solution [Xue et al., 2001; Al-Omari, 2006; Narayanan

and Trouvé, 2009; Crnomarkovic et al., 2013] since it is of quite simple implementation if

compared to other spectral models. Besides that, studies have shown that the GG model

leads to pool accuracy when the media is dominated by participating gases, and becomes

more accurate as the soot concentration increases [Mossi et al., 2012; Cassol et al., 2015].

When there is a non-gray media, the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) solution

can be found by three groups of methods : Band Models, Global Models, and Line-by-line

(LBL) method. In the LBL method the RTE integration is performed over the entire radi-

ation spectrum taking into account the contribution of each spectral line. This procedure

requires about 106 resolution of the RTE [Modest, 2003b], involving a lot of computa-

tional e?ort that is not feasible for practical applications [Demarco, 2012]. However, this

method is useful for providing benchmark solutions, and it has been used in a few works

which solve two-dimensional problems [Mazumder and Modest, 2002; Modest and Zhang,

2002; Zhang and Modest, 2002, 2003; Pal and Modest, 2010; Chu et al., 2012; Consalvi

and Liu, 2014; Centeno et al., 2016].

The Band Models (BM) consist of dividing the radiation spectrum into spectral

intervals in which the radiative properties are considered constant, and are classi?ed in

Narrow Band (NB) and Wide Band (WB) models. With the NB models is possible to re-

place the actual absorption coe?cient behavior by average values over narrow wavenumber

intervals. In the WB models the integration is realized over larger wavenumber intervals

considering that blackbody intensities do not vary substantially across bands. Despite

being less computationally expansive, WB models does not achieve the same level of ac-

curacy as the NB models [Modest, 2003b]. The disadvantaged of Band Models is the

di?culty to be used in an arbitrary solution technique of the RTE, as the discrete or-

dinates method (DOM), since they yield gas transmissivity (NB model) or absorptance

(WB model) instead of absorption coe?cient. One alternative to overcome such issue is

to implement the band models through the correlated-k (CK) methodology to acquire

absorption coe?cients [Liu and Smallwood, 2004]. In the BM are included the Statistical

Narrow Band (SNB) [Goody, 1952], SNB based on CK (SNBCK) [Liu and Smallwood,

2004], Exponential Wide Band (EWB) [Edwards and Balakrishnan, 1973], and Wide Band

based on CK (WBCK) [Çayan and Selçuk, 2007] models. In the absence of the LBL calcu-

lation due to its excessive computing time, the SNB model is used as benchmark solution

for gas radiation transfer problems [Bresslo?, 1999; Goutiere et al., 2000; Coelho, 2002;

Demarco et al., 2011].

Global Models propose an integration scheme over the absorption coe?cient rather

than wavenumber. This engineering approach typically renders fewer than 20 integrations

of the RTE for prediction of total quantities such as radiative ?ux and net ?ux divergence,

while the LBL method requires millions of times, which is prohibitively expensive. One

popular Global Model is the Weighted-Sum-of-Gray-Gases (WSGG), initially developed

by Hottel and Saro?m, 1967. The approach of this model replaces the integration of

spectral properties with a summation over a small set of gray gases (often three or four)

plus the spectral window to simulate the properties of the non-gray gas. These gray gases

replace the real spectrum behavior, and it is considered that each of them has uniform

absorption coe?cient and a temperature coe?cient which correspond to the fraction of

blackbody energy emitted in the spectral region that represent each gray gas location.

The coe?cients of such gray gases in the WSGG model can be determined from ?tting

data of total emittance computed, for instance, from LBL calculations of high-resolution



7

spectral absorption coe?cient. Smith et al., 1982 present these coe?cients obtained from

interpolation of experimental data. However, such coe?cients are limited to H2O/CO2

mixture with uniform concentration, and they can generate elevated errors in the solution

when compared to problems that use modern spectral data [Maurente et al., 2008; Mossi

et al., 2012]. Despite this, such correlations are still used in contemporary studies [Trivic,

2014] and in commercial software of computational ?uid dynamics as the ANSYS/Fluent

[Fluent, 2018].

Nonetheless, few studies have focused on generate new WSGG correlations for

H2O/CO2 mixtures [Kangwanpongpan et al., 2012; Dorigon et al., 2013], and for individ-

ual species such as carbon monoxide (CO) [Ziemniczak et al., 2015; Brittes et al., 2017].

Although the correlations are, often, obtained for a wide temperature range, the partial

pressure ratio between the species is maintained constant. For this reason, Johansson

et al., 2011 proposed a WSGG modi?cation to consider partial pressure ratio between

H2O and CO2 varying from 0.125 to 2.

Besides having a relatively simple formulation, the WSGG model does not require

the knowledge of spectral data banks, and was demonstrated by Modest, 1991 that this

model can be applied with arbitrary RTE methods of solution since the media is non-

scattering with a black-walled enclosure. However, Modest and Zhang, 2000 showed that

these restrictions can be disregarded. Thereby, the WSGG methodology is adopted in

several problems solution as those of oxi-combustion [Becher et al., 2012; Rajhi et al.,

2014; Garten et al., 2015], one-dimensional [Dorigon et al., 2013; Fonseca and França,

2015; Ziemniczak et al., 2015; Brittes et al., 2017; Fonseca et al., 2018], two-dimensional

[Silva et al., 2007; Centeno et al., 2013; Crnomarkovic et al., 2013; Centeno et al., 2014;

Garten et al., 2015; Centeno et al., 2016], and three-dimensional problems [Coelho, 2002;

Trivic, 2014; Bhuiyan and Naser, 2015; G.Clements et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015; Fraga

et al., 2017], as well as in the Turbulence-Radiation-Iterations (TRI) modeling [Silva et al.,

2007; Krishnamoorthy, 2010; Coelho, 2012; Centeno et al., 2014; Shiehnejadhesar et al.,

2014; Centeno et al., 2016; Fraga et al., 2017].

Although the standard WSGG model be widely used in engineering computations

of radiative heat transfer in participating media, it is limited to the gas mixtures where the

mole ratio between the species is constant. As a way to eliminate this restriction, Cassol

et al., 2014 applied the superposition methodology [Smith et al., 1987] to the WSGG



8

model for H2O, CO2, and soot mixtures . This approach consists on ?rst setting up

independent correlations for each species, which are then superposed to form the WSGG

correlations for the mixture. Thus, it is possible to compute the radiative heat transfer

in mixtures with arbitrary concentrations, allowing for local variations in the mole ratios,

and the inclusion of any number of participating species.

Based on these advantages, a few works have been done on which is used the

WSGG model with the superposition approach. Centeno et al., 2016 studied the e?ect

of soot on the radiative heat transfer in a turbulent, non-premixed methane?air ?ame

inside a combustion chamber. It was shown that the superposition of the correlations

of H2O/CO2 mixtures and soot in the WSGG model provides results of good agreement

with the LBL benchmark solution. The TRI phenomena in the context of a non-reactive

3-D channel ?ow of a high temperature homogeneous participating gas was successfully

modeled using the WSGG model with the superposition method [Fraga et al., 2017].

Another recent paper also explored this approaching in the computation of the radiative

heat transfer in an axisymmetric gas system composed of H2O, CO2, and soot [Centeno

et al., 2018]. This study showed that the superposition method between the coe?cients of

the individual species led to the least accurate results, while the WSGG model considering

the superposition between the H2O/CO2 mixture and soot coe?cients proved the best

alternative for both moderate and high concentrations of soot.

Another prominent Global Model that also uses the superposition method is the

Spectral-Line Weighted-Sum-of-Gray-Gases (SLW) ?rst introduced by Denison and Webb,

1993b. The fundamental component of this model is the absorption line blackbody dis-

tribution function (ALBDF). For a given gas temperature, the ALBDF is the fraction of

the blackbody energy in the portions of the spectrum where the spectral absorption cross-

section of the gas is less than a prescribed value. The ALBDF is used for temperature

coe?cient calculation of each gray gas in the RTE solution. This function is generated

with a detailed spectral data available in databases as the HITRAN and HITEMP. Since

this procedure spend much computational time, empirical correlations for ALBDF of

H2O [Denison and Webb, 1993a], and CO2 [Denison and Webb, 1995a] were developed in

a form of a hyperbolic tangent function. Radiative transfer model parameters for carbon

monoxide (CO) were also proposed [Solovjov and Webb, 1998].

New ALBDF correlations for H2O, CO2, and CO based on the updated HITEMP



9

2010 database were generated by Pearson et al., 2014b. In this study were considered

variable temperature, mole fraction, and total pressure. The LBL ALBDF was also com-

puted and tabulated for discrete temperature, mole fractions, and total pressure ranging

from 300 K to 3000 K, 0 to 1, and 0.1 atm to 50 atm, respectively. The correlation showed

an accuracy that is quite adequate for engineering applications but considerably less accu-

rate than the tabulated ALBDF. In spite of having an initial computational cost to read

the data, the inaccuracy of the tabulated ALBDF is only caused by interpolations used

to obtain its values at speci?ed conditions [Pearson, 2013]. The e?ect of total pressure

on the ALBDF and radiative transfer in H2O, CO2, and CO was also recently analyzed

[Pearson et al., 2014a].

In the non-isothermal and/or non-homogeneous media treatment, the Liebnitz rule

leads to appearance of additional terms in the spectral integration of the RTE. This ren-

ders the analysis complicated, especially for multidimensional media, and alter the RTE

standard form of solution [Denison and Webb, 1993b]. As an alternative, two approaches

have been adopted to treat these terms in the SLW model. The ?rst is the reference

approach which allows the Liebnitz terms to be canceled using a reference state [Denison

and Webb, 1995c]. Since this method require the implicit calculation of a set of parame-

ters, the computational time can be expensive. The second approach suggests the simple

neglect of these terms from the RTE [Solovjov and Webb, 2000], however this procedure

can yield signi?cant errors and less accuracy if compared with the reference approach

[Pearson, 2013].

For the case of gas mixtures, some approaches have also been proposed. The dou-

ble integration and the convolution approaches were applied to radiative heat transfer

calculation in H2O/CO2 mixtures [Denison and Webb, 1995b]. The extension to multi-

component gas mixtures with the superposition and multiplication approaches, along with

a hybrid of the two, were also introduced [Solovjov and Webb, 2000]. The soot inclusion

as a gas in the multiplication method was studied by Solovjov and Webb, 2001. A new

model, named SLW-1, was introduced by Solovjov et al., 2011a for individual species and

latter for non-isothermal non-homogeneous gaseous mixture with soot [Solovjov et al.,

2011b]. In this methodology, the problem is reduced to the simplest case of the SLW

model with a single gray gas and a clear gas, providing the accuracy near that of the SLW

method with a large number of gray gases.



10

As the SLW model, the Full-Spectrum k-Distribution model (FSK) can be viewed

as an improvement of the WSGG [Demarco, 2012]. In the FSK model, The RTE so-

lution is given by a integration over a distribution function virtually identical to the

ALBDF developed by Denison and Webb, 1993a [Pearson, 2013]. Proposed by Modest

e Zhang [Modest and Zhang, 2000, 2002], th FSK model has been implemented with

both correlated-k and scaled-k distribution methods. These methods are an approach

developed for non-homogeneous media treatment, while for homogeneous medium (i.e.,

the absorption coe?cient is not a function of spatial coordinate) with narrow spectral

intervals (i.e., range over which the Planck's function is nearly constant) the absorption

coe?cient may be reordered into a monotonic k-distribution, which produces exact results

in a small fraction of the time required for LBL calculations [Modest, 2003a; Modest and

Riazzi, 2005]. The correlated-k method is based on the fact that inside a spectral band,

which is su?ciently narrow to assume a constant Planck's function, the precise position

of a spectral line is not important for spectral integration. In the scaled-k distribution

the spectral and spatial dependence of the absorption coe?cient are separately treated.

Thereby, the FSK model has been applied to radiative transfer prediction in non-

homogeneous gas mixtures [Modest and Zhang, 2002; Wang and Modest, 2005; Pal et al.,

2008], nonhomogeneous gas-soot mixtures [Pal and Modest, 2010], and in multidimen-

sional media [Modest and Zhang, 2002; Mazumder and Modest, 2002; Modest and Riazzi,

2005; Ma et al., 2014]. Its relation with the SLW model is discussed by Solovjov and

Webb, 2009, showing that these two models are equivalent when the number of gray gases

tends to in?nity.

The concept of correlated spectrum [Modest, 2013], initially refereed as ideal spec-

trum by Denison and Webb, 1995c, has been recently applied to the SLW model. It

establishes a relation between absorption coe?cient at an arbitrary state and the absorp-

tion coe?cient at some chosen reference state. An extension of this approach is the novel

Rank Correlated SLW (RC-SLW) model of gas radiation in non-uniform media developed

by Solovjov et al., 2017. The approach of this model is remarkable by the fact that it does

not require the speci?cation of a reference gas thermodynamic state, and it preserves the

emission term in the spectrally integrated RTE. Studies have shown that the RC-SLW

model provides more accurate results than the original SLW model based on a reference

state [Solovjov et al., 2017; Andre et al., 2017]. The range of the ALBDF database has



11

also been studied for the accurate radiative prediction in this model [Webb et al., 2018],

and it is shown that good accuracy may be achieved by using the RC-SLW model with as

few as 3?5 gray gases. A more general assumption of rank correlated spectrum is given

by the scaled spectrum assumption used for the Scaled SLW model proposition [Solovjov

et al., 2017, 2018].

The Absorption Distribution Function (ADF) model is another distinguished Global

Model. Developed in the 1990's [Rivière et al., 1996], the ADF model is quite similar to

the SLW [Modest and Zhang, 2002; Pierrot et al., 1999a], di?ering only in the calculation

of the gray gas temperature coe?cients. This method was extended to non-isothermal

media by means of the absorption distribution function model proposition with ?ctitious

gases (ADFFG) [Pierrot et al., 1999a]. For a non-isothermal medium, it was shown that

the ADF and SLW models lead to resemblant accuracy, and the ADFFG model proved to

be more accurate than these latest models, but requires greater computing time [Pierrot

et al., 1999b].

Instead of the full-spectrum correlation techniques traditionally used (i.e., ideal

behavior of the spectrum), a new model, called Cumulative Wavenumber (CW), proposes

a local-spectrum correlation for the solution of the RTE in non-uniform media at high

temperature [Solovjov and Webb, 2002]. By means of the cumulative wavenumber (a new

gas absorption spectral distribution function), this model introduces a local correction

factor to consider the spatial variation of species concentration and gas temperature cal-

culated independently in each ?xed spectral interval. Thus, there is no Leibniz terms

production in the RTE solution. This approach is an attempt to replace the scale ap-

proximation. Despite providing good results for radiative heat transfer calculation, the

CW model formulation do not satisfy the energy balance, presenting considerable error in

the radiative heat ?ux prediction, as shown by Galarça et al., 2011. For this reason, the

Modi?ed CW (MCW) model was developed [Galarça et al., 2011] to satisfy the energy

balance while keeping the same value of the radiative volumetric heat source. The MCW

model demonstrated to be more accurate than CW, however, spends much computational

time, that can not be practical to be coupled with combustion problems.

Some CW model applications for radiative transfer calculation in participating

gases have been accomplished. This model has been extended to non-uniform gas mixtures

with soot [Solovjov and Webb, 2005], and to account for non-gray walls [Solovjov et al.,



12

2013]. A fast approach was applied to reduce the computational cost [Salinas, 2008],

and two-dimensional problems were also studied [Ismail and Salinas, 2005; Salinas, 2008].

The multilayer approach was used to modeling non-isothermal gaseous medium by SLW

and CW models [Solovjov and Webb, 2008]. In this methodology the non-isothermal

media is modeled by a system of isotherm layers, and, thus, the intervals of spectral

integration do not vary with spatial coordinate within the layers. Hence, the Leibnitz

terms are eliminated in the spectral integration of the RTE, but the spectral integration

in the interface between the layers requires special consideration for the consistency of

the model radiation intensities in di?erent layers.

As demonstrated in the literature, even more simple gas models such as the WSGG

can provide satisfactory results for the radiative transfer prediction in combustion gases.

The superposition method applied to the WSGG has shown to be a good alternative

for radiative transfer computation in non-homogeneous mixtures, and recently has been

applied in some works [Centeno et al., 2016; Fraga et al., 2017; Centeno et al., 2018].

Even though in these works have been used the WSGG model based on the superposi-

tion method, it was carried out for complex and multidimensional problems. However,

the application of the superposition approach in the WSGG model needs to be better

understood in fundamental problems. Since this method is also used in the SLW mixture

modeling, the solution of this model can be adequately compared with that of the WSGG.

In this work, the WSGG and SLW model solutions are investigated in one-dimensional

problems, for H2O, CO2, and H2O/CO2 mixture gas layers, exploring di?erent pro?les of

temperature and concentration of the participating species. Moreover, the main challenge

in the radiative transfer prediction using the superposition method is the combination

of participating gases since it requires increasing computational e?ort as the components

number increase. Thereby, it is fundamental to develop a methodology capable of reduce

the computational time in such cases. Performing this study with the WSGG model is

another objective of this work.

2.2 Summary

The LBL method provides the higher level of accuracy in radiative transfer pre-

dictions in participating media. However, it spends a computational time that can be

prohibitively high for practical applications. The Band Models become a restrictive alter-



13

native since it provides the gas transmissivity or the absorptance, which can not be used

with arbitrary RTE solution methods. Such di?culty is removed by the Global Models

that yield the absorption coe?cient. The WSGG is the simplest Global Model, but can

provide satisfactory results for the radiative transfer prediction in combustion gases. The

SLW model has received several improvements in the last years. The formulation of this

model is based on the superposition method, which has also been recently explored in

the WSGG model. The superposition method furnishes some new possibilities to the

WSGG model, such as the treatment of mixtures with arbitrary concentrations, local

variable mole ratios, and with any number of participating species. However, the WSGG

model, employing this approach, need to be better investigated in fundamental problems,

comparing the solution with that of SLW model, and searching for ways to reduce the

computational e?ort which signi?cantly increases as the number of participating gases

also increases. Such investigations are made in this work.

3 FUNDAMENTALS OF THERMAL RADIATION

The thermal radiation propagation can be described by two viewpoints: quantum

mechanics and classical electromagnetic wave theory. With the ?rst, the thermal radiation

energy is described as quanta of particles, or photons. A statistical mechanism is used

to approximate their propagation in a medium and interaction with matter. Thermal

radiation also can be viewed as consisting of electromagnetic waves. In general, radiative

properties of liquids and solids are more easily predicted using electromagnetic wave

theory, while radiative properties of gases are more conveniently obtained from quantum

mechanics [Modest, 2013]. For practical engineering applications, the thermal radiation

regions of interest is in the wavelength range of 0.1 µm to 100 µm, including the ultraviolet

and visible (? = 0.1 to 0.7 µm), near-infrared (? = 0.7 to 10 µm), and far-infrared (? =

10 to 100 µm) spectra [Howell et al., 2010].

Unlike conduction and convection, the thermal radiation can be transferred over a

long distance without interacting with a medium. Because of this, it is of great importance

in vacuum, space applications, and combustion processes. Another distinguishing feature

which di?er these three heat transfer mechanisms is that conductive and convective heat

transfer rates are linearly proportional to temperature di?erences, and, on the other hand,

radiative heat transfer rates are generally proportional to di?erences in temperature to

the fourth power. Therefore, thermal radiation becomes more important than conduction

and convection in high temperatures, as in combustion applications (?res, furnaces, rocket

nozzles, engines, etc.). Since the modern technologies have as priority higher e?ciencies, it

will require higher temperatures, making thermal radiation even more important [Modest,

2013]. This chapter will show same fundamentals concepts of thermal radiation, which

are important to the development of this work.

3.1 Blackbody

The concept of a blackbody is basic to the study of radiative transfer. The black-

body is called an ideal body, and it allows all the incident radiation pass into it (no

re?ected energy) and internally absorbs all the incident radiation (no energy transmit-

ted through the body). This behavior happens for all wavenumbers and for all angles of

incidence [Howell and Siegel, 2002]. Hence, the blackbody is a perfect absorber for all



15

incident radiation, and it serves as a standard with which real absorbers can be compared

to. The blackbody also emits the maximum total amount of energy at each wavenumber

and at each direction.

Considering a blackbody at temperature T enveloped by a hemispherical detector

that captures thermal radiation with a wavenumber ? within a wavenumber interval d?, as

shown in Figure 3.1, the hemispherical spectral emissive power, E?b, in W/(m2.µm), is the

energy emitted by a black surface per unit time per unit area and per unit wavenumber

interval around ?. This quantity is given by Planck's spectral distribution of emissive

power:

E?b(?,T) =
2C1??

3

eC2?/T ? 1
(3.1)

where, C1 and C2 are constants for which the values are, respectively, 0.59552137 × 108

W.µm4/(m2.sr) and 1.4387752 × 104µm; T (K) is the temperature, and ? (cm?1) is the

wavenumber.

Integrating Equation 3.1 over all the spectrum, results the mathematic expression

called Stefan-Boltzmann law:

Eb = ?T
4 (3.2)

in which Eb is the emitted blackbody energy ?ux (W/m2), and ? = 5.670400 × 10?8

W/(m2.K4) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Through this expression it is possible

to calculate the radiation emission quantity in all directions and all wavenumbers only

knowing the blackbody temperature.

Howell et al., 2010].

3.2 Thermal Radiation Intensity

The intensity is an important quantity for studying radiative transfer in absorbing,

emitting, and scattering media due to certain invariance properties. The emitted spec-

tral intensity is de?ned as the energy emitted per unit time per unit small wavenumber

interval around the wavenumber ?, per unit elemental projected surface area normal to

the direction and into a unit elemental solid angle centered around the direction given by

the polar angle ?. For an elemental area dA within participating media shown in Fig. 3.2,

the spectral radiation intensity is:

I? =
d3QR

dA cos ?d?d?
(3.3)

where I? is expressed in W/(m2.µm.sr). For a non-attenuating and non-emitting medium

with constant properties, the intensity in a given direction is independent of position along

that direction.

Figure 3.2 ? Spectral intensity emitted by an elemental area dA [adapted from Siegel

and Howell, 1993].

Another feature is that the radiation emitted by the blackbody depends on the

wavenumber and on the temperature, and it is independent of direction, being, thus,

a di?use emitter [Howell and Siegel, 2002]. The blackbody radiation intensity has its

relation with the spectral emissive power according to:

I?b(?,T) =
E?b
?

=
2C1?

3

eC2?/T ? 1
(3.4)

in which I?b is the spectral radiation intensity emitted by blackbody, in W/(m2.µm.sr).

For a participating media, such as a mixture of water vapor and carbon dioxide,



17

the radiative intensity is a function of the distance along a path. It happens due to

absorption, emission and the scattering e?ects of the medium.

3.2.1 Attenuation of Intensity by Absorption

The spectral radiation of intensity I? incident normally on a volume element of

thickness ds which absorbs radiation, can be analyzed in Fig. 3.3. As radiation passes

through ds, its intensity is reduced by absorption. This change in the intensity is propor-

tional to the magnitude of the local intensity, as has been found experimentally [Howell

and Siegel, 2002]. If the media is non-scattering, the coe?cient of proportionality will be

the absorption coe?cient (??). Thus, the decrease is:

dI? = ???I?ds (3.5)

Figure 3.3 ? Intensity incident normally on absorbing volume element dV [adapted from

Siegel and Howell, 1993)].

3.2.2 The Increase of Intensity by Emission

For emission of energy within the medium, it is considered an elemental volume

dV (Figure. 3.4) at the center of a large black hollow sphere of radius R at uniform

temperature T . The elemental volume dV limits a participating medium with absorption

coe?cient ??, and the space between dV and the sphere is ?lled with non-participating

material. The spectral intensity incident at the elemental area dAs, from element dA

is I?(s = 0) = I?b(?,T), where I?b is the blackbody spectral intensity. Because of the



18

absorption, the change of the intensity in dV is [Howell and Siegel, 2002]:

? I?(0)??ds = ?I?b(?,T)??ds (3.6)

The energy absorbed by the di?erential volume dSdAs is I?b(?,T)??dSdAsd?d?, where

d? = dA/R2 and dAs is the projected area normal to I?(0). The energy emitted by dA

and absorbed by all of dV is ??I?b(?,T )dV d?d? (result from integration over all dAsdS

elements), where d? is the solid angle de?ned by dA when viewed from dV . The energy

incident upon dV from the entire spherical enclosure, is obtained by integration over all

solid angles, which gives 4???I?b(?,T)dV d?.

Figure 3.4 ? Geometry for derivation of emission from elemental volume[ Siegel and

Howell, 1993].

The elemental volume dV must emit energy equal to that absorbed to maintain

equilibrium in the enclosure. Hence, for a isothermal volume, the spectral emissivity is

given by the expression:

4???I?b(?,T)I?b(?,T)dV d? = 4??I?b(?,T)E?b(?,T)dV d? (3.7)

where E?b is the blackbody spectral emissive power. Finally, considering that the thermal

emission is uniform over all directions, the spectral intensity emitted by an elemental

volume into any direction is:

dI? = ??I?bds (3.8)



19

3.3 Spectral Line Broadening

It is convenient to discuss the radiation process by utilizing a photon or quantum

point of view. Since the photon is the basic unit of radiative energy, the emission releases

photons, and absorption is the capture of photons. When a photon is emitted or absorbed,

the energy is correspondingly decreased or increased. However, a photon can also transfer

part of its energy by the scattering process which is of minor engineering relevance [Howell

and Siegel, 2002]. The magnitude of the radiative energy transition is related to the

frequency of the emitted or absorbed radiation according to:

Ep = Ej ?Ei = h?ij (3.9)

in which h is Planck's constant and ? is the frequency of the photon energy; Ei and Ej

are the energy that a photon can present in the levels i and j, respectively.

A ?xed frequency is associated with the transition from a speci?c energy level to

another. Thus, in the absence of other e?ects, the spectrum of the emitted radiation

is a spectral line at that frequency. For a photon to be absorbed, the frequency of the

photon energy must have one of certain discrete values. According to Equation 3.9, very

little energy could be absorbed from the entire incident spectrum by an absorption line,

since only those having a single wavenumber could be absorbed. However, other e?ects

cause the line to be broadened and consequently to have a ?nite wavenumber span around

the transition wavenumber ?ij. Some important e?ects are the physical mechanisms such

as natural, Doppler, collision, and Stark broadening. Each one of these mechanisms

contribute to a certain shape of the spectral lines, as shown in Figure 3.5, where ?D

and ?L are the spectral line half-width for Doppler and Lorentz broadening, respectively,

measured in the middle of the height.

The line intensity can be obtained with the integration of the absorption coe?cient

over all the wavenumber range according to the following expression:

Sij =

? ?
0

??,ij(?)d? =

? ?
??

??,ij(?)d(? ??ij) (3.10)

where Sij and ??,ij depend on the number of molecules in transition between the levels

i and j, and on the gas density. The e?ect of the density on magnitude is seen taking

the ratio ??/Sij. Thus, it shows the e?ect of density in changing the line shape. In the



20

subsections that follow are shown the mechanisms of line broadening.

Figure 3.5 ? Spectral line shape for di?erent line broadening mechanisms [adapted from

Modest, 2013].

3.3.1 Natural Broadening

This mechanism happens when a stationary emitter not perturbed by any external

e?ects emits energy over a ?nite spectral interval about each transition wavenumber. This

natural line broadening arises from the uncertainty in the exact levels Ei and Ej of the

transition energy states, and is given by the Lorentz pro?le [Howell et al., 2010]:

?ij(?)

Sij
=

??/?

?2? + (? ??ij)2
(3.11)

where ?? is the half-width. In engineering applications the half-width for natural broaden-

ing is usually small compared with that for other line broadening phenomena, and, thus,

this mechanism is neglected.

3.3.2 Doppler Broadening

Since the atoms or molecules of an absorbing or emitting gas are not stationary,

it has a distribution of velocities associated with its thermal energy. If the gas molecules

are in thermal equilibrium, it has a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of velocities which



21

results in a spectral line shape with a Gaussian distribution [Howell et al., 2010]:

Sij

?D

(3.12)

in which ?D is the line half-width for Doppler broadening,

?D =
?ij
c

(
2KT

M
ln 2

)1/2
(3.13)

Here, c is the speed of light in the vacuum (c = 2.998 × 108m/s), K is Boltzmann's

constant (K = 1.3806 × 10?23J/K), T is the temperature in K, and M is the molecules

mass, in kg. Since ?D depends on T 1/2, the Doppler broadening becomes important at

high temperatures, more speci?cally above those found in combustion systems.

3.3.3 Collision Broadening

The collision rate by an atom or molecule increases when the gas pressure gas

is increased, and it perturbs the energy states of atoms or molecules, resulting in colli-

sion broadening of spectral lines. The line shape has a Lorentz pro?le, as the natural

broadening [Howell et al., 2010]:

?ij(?)

Sij
=

?c/?

?2c + (? ??ij)2
(3.14)

where the collision half-width ?c is determined by the collision rate,

?c =
1

2?c

4
?
?D2pi

(MKT)1/2
(3.15)

in which D is the diameter of the atoms or molecules and pi is the gas pressure for the

single component gas. With this equation, it is shown that collision broadening become

important at high pressures and low temperatures. For engineering infrared conditions,

the collision broadening is often the mean contributor to line broadening, and the other

line broadening mechanisms can usually be neglected.

3.3.4 Stark Broadening

When the Stark e?ect happens, the energy levels of the radiating gas particles can

be greatly perturbed due to the presence of strong electric ?elds. This kind of physical

mechanism can produce very large line broadening. The Stark broadening is observed



22

in ionized gases due to the interactions of radiating particles with electrons and protons.

The line shapes must be calculated by quantum mechanisms, and are quite unsymmetrical

and complicated.

3.4 Absorption Coe?cient

As already discussed, the absorption coe?cient of participating gases has a strong

variation with the wavenumber. The determination of this coe?cient is given by means of

the computation of the absorption cross section, which, according to Howell et al., 2010,

is obtained with the Lorentz collision pro?le:

C? =
?
i

Si
?

?i
?2i + (? ??i)2

(3.16)

In this equation ? is the wavenumber, C? is the absorption cross section, in cm2/molecule,

Si is the integrated intensity of the line i, ?i is the line location in the spectrum (found

in spectral databases), and ?i is the line half-width. In Equation 3.16 the summation

includes all the lines that are within an interval ??, for which the contribution of C? is

signi?cant.

In the work of Wang and Modest, 2004, it is shown that, for both H2O and CO2,

the Lorentz pro?le is adequate for total pressure of 1 atm or higher and temperatures

above 2500 K. The integrated intensity of a spectral line, Si, for a given temperature T

(K), is calculated with the following expression [Rothman et al., 2010]:

Si(T) = Si(T0)
Q(T0)

Q(T)

exp(?C2Ei/T)
exp(?C2Ei/T0)

1 ?exp(?C2?iT)
1 ?exp(?C2?iT0)

(3.17)

where T0 is the database reference temperature (T0 = 296 K in the HITEMP), Q is

the total intern partition sum (which depends on the molecule structure, its isotope and

temperature) [Fischer et al., 2003], and represents the summation of all energy states

(electronic, vibrational, rotational, torsional, etc.); Ei is the energy of the lower state

(cm?1), and ?i is the energy di?erence between the initial and ?nal state (given as vacuum

wavenumber, cm?1, in the database). The constant C2 is the second Planck's constant

(C2 = 1.43877 cm.K).

The quantities Si(T0), Ei, and ?i are provided in the HITRAN compilation, and

the value of Q is obtained with a Fortran routine [Fischer et al., 2003] available in the

databases. The line half-width ?i (p,T) for a gas at pressure p (atm), temperature T (K),



23

and partial pressure pi (atm), is calculated as [Rothman et al., 1998]:

?i(p,T) =

(
T0
T

)n[
?air,i(p0,T0)(p?pi) + ?self,i(p0,T0)pi

]
(3.18)

in which n is the temperature dependence coe?cient, p0 is the reference pressure, ?air,i

is the air-broadened half-width, and ?self,i is the self-broadened half-width. Since the

databases only provides ?air,i, Rothman et al., 1998 proposes that n = ?air,i = ?self,i.

After de?ning the spectral line intensity Si(T), the line half-wight ?i (p,T), and

the absorption cross section C?, then the absorption coe?cient can be expressed as:

??(p,T,Y ) = N(p,T)Y C?(p,T,Y ) (3.19)

Here, Y = pi/p is the gas molar fraction, N(p,T) = pNA/RuT is the gas molar density,

being NA = 6.022×10?23 molecules/mol the Avogadro's number, and Ru = 8.314 J/mol.K

the gases universal constant.

3.5 Spectral Databases

The advances in the spectroscopy of high resolution in the last decades have been

very important in the thermal radiation ?eld. It allowed the detailed compilation of

parameters of those molecules that are the mean constituents of the terrestrial atmosphere.

McClatchey et al., 1973 published a technical report containing spectral data of molecules

of water vapor, carbon dioxide, ozone, nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, methane, and oxygen.

Some of the parameters included were the frequency, intensity, half-width and the energy

of the lower state of transition. Posteriorly, this study gave rise to the HITRAN database

[Rothman et al., 1987] which has been periodically updated. The HITRAN2012 [Rothman

et al., 2013] encompassing spectral information of 47 molecules. This database has its

origins in applications for conditions of the terrestrial atmosphere. The last update is the

HITRAN2016 [Gordon et al., 2017].

For combustion applications arises the need of molecules spectra at high temper-

atures (&gt; 1000 K). This requirement was attended by Rothman et al., 1995 with the

HITEMP1995 spectroscopic database. Hence, it contains many more spectral lines than

HITRAN for participating species. The last version, the HITEMP2010, has the spectral

data of the absorbers H2O, CO2, CO, NO, and OH [Rothman et al., 2010]. One inter-

esting point to note is that in the HITEMP2010 there is an amount of spectral lines for



24

H2O and CO2 much greater than for the others species, as can be seen in Table 3.1.

Table 3.1 ? Number of spectral lines for molecules of the HITEMP2010 [Rothman et al.,

2010].

Molecule Spectral Coverage (cm?1) Number of Spectral Lines
H2O 0 - 30,000 111,377,777
CO2 258 - 9,648 11,167,618
CO 0 - 8,465 115,218
NO 0 - 9,274 105,633
OH 0 - 19,268 40,055

3.6 Radiative Transfer Equation

When it is considered a participating media, such as a H2O/CO2 mixtures at

high temperatures, the particles emits and absorbs radiation, and the scattering of this

quantity can be neglected. To take into account the emission and absorption e?ects it

is necessary to do the radiative energy balance over the enclosure. Thus, it results in

the radiative transfer equation (RTE) which, for a non-scattering media, accounts for the

spectral intensity variation along a given path x [Modest, 2013]:

dI?
dx

= ???(x)I?(x) + ??(x)I?b(x) (3.20)

where, in the right-side, the ?rst term represents the intensity attenuation due to ab-

sorption, and the second is the intensity increasing due to emission; ?? is the spectral

absorption coe?cient and I?b is the blackbody spectral radiation intensity, which were

discussed in the previous sections. This equation needs to be solved for all directions and

wavenumbers.

3.7 Summary

Unlike conduction and convection, the thermal radiation can be transferred along

a distance without interacting with the medium. Since this mechanism is proportional to

di?erences in temperature to the fourth power, it is very important in high temperatures

such as those of combustion process. In this kind of problems, the blackbody, as a perfect

absorber for all incident thermal radiation, serves as a standard with which real absorbers



25

can be compared. Another fundamental de?nition in the radiation ?eld is the spectral

intensity. As the radiation passes through a participating media, the intensity can be

attenuated by absorption, and increased by emission. The concepts of line broadening also

must be considered. For engineering applications, the e?ect of the collision broadening

is the most important. However, the Doppler broadening can become also relevant at

elevated temperatures. To solve the RTE, besides to calculate the radiation intensity, it

is needed to know the absorption coe?cient of the gases. This coe?cient depends on the

absorption cross section, which can be obtained from the spectral databases.



26

4 AVAILABLE METHODS FOR SPECTRAL INTEGRATION OF THE

RTE AND A NEW PROPOSITION

After presenting the spectral form of the RTE, which needS to be solved for all di-

rection and all wavenumbers, some methods for its spectral integration will be described.

In this chapter, only the methods relevant to this work will be shown. The LBL integra-

tion may require a high computational time depending on the problem under analysis.

It happens due to the highly irregular behavior of the absorption coe?cient with the

wavenumber. One common alternative is to apply the gas models such as the WSGG and

the SLW for the radiative transfer computation.

4.1 The Line-by-Line Integration

As already discussed, the absorption coe?cient of the participating gases presents

a strong variation with the wavenumber. This behavior is characterized by hundreds of

thousands of spectral lines forming the gases spectra. In the Line-by-Line (LBL) solution

of the RTE it is considered each one of these spectral lines individually. Because of this

approach, the LBL method is taken as a benchmark solution with which the accuracy of

the gases models is veri?ed.

In Figure 4.1 there is a representation of an one-dimensional participating medium

bounded by two parallel surfaces separated by a distance L. The spectral intensities in

the forward and backward direction, I+?,l(x) and I
?
?,l(x), in a non-scattering participat-

ing media, are determined from the RTE equation as follow, according to the discrete

ordinates method (DOM)[Cassol et al., 2014; Modest, 2013]:

µl
dI+?,l(x)

dx
= ???(x)I+?,l(x) + ??(x)I?b(x) (4.1)

?µl
dI??,l(x)

dx
= ???(x)I??,l(x) + ??(x)I?b(x) (4.2)

in which µl is the the cosine of the polar angle ?l in l direction, I
+
?,l and I

?
?,l are the

spectral radiation intensities for µl &gt; 0 and µl &amp;lt;0, respectively; x is the spatial position.

Considering that the walls are black with known temperatures, the boundary conditions

for Equations 4.1 and 4.2 at positions x = 0 and x = L are, respectively, I+?,l(0) = I?b(0)

and I??,l(L) = I?b(L).



27

If Equation 4.1 and 4.2 are solved for all directions and wavenumbers, the radiative

heat ?ux and the heat source, q”R and ?qR, respectively, at position x, can be calculated by

[Cassol et al., 2014]:

}
d? (4.4)

where, for nd directions, the µl and the weights ?l of the quadrature scheme are de?ned

within the interval [0,1]. To solve the radiative transfer equation, in this work was used

the Gauss Legendre quadrature.

Usually the RTE must be solved for a mixture of gases such as those found in

combustion systems. Thus, the spectral absorption coe?cient in Equations 4.1 and 4.2

has to be modi?ed. For a mixture of H2O and CO2 this coe?cient is written then as:

?? = ??,w + ??,c (4.5)

in which ??,w and ??,c are the spectral absorption coe?cients for H2O and CO2, respec-

tively.

4.2 Weighted-Sum-of-Gray-Gases

Since the LBL integration solves the RTE for each spectral line, it requires a high

computational time which may be not feasible for practical applications. Based on this,

the Weighted-Sum-of-Gray-Gases (WSGG) model comes to overcome this di?cult with

a good accuracy. Initially proposed by Hottel and Saro?m, 1967, this model replaces the



28

spectrum by a set of gray gases with uniform pressure absorption coe?cient, as shown in

Figure 4.2. Thus, it is assumed that each gray gas covers a ?xed portion ??j in the spec-

trum. Moreover, each pressure absorption coe?cient ?p,j is assumed to be independent

of the temperature and partial pressure of the participating gases.

Figure 4.2 ? Pressure absorption coe?cient representation using ng gray gases [ adapted

from Dorigon et al., 2013].

One parameter of great importance for the WSGG model is the total emittance

along a certain path s in a medium at a given temperature and composition. This quantity

accounts for the amount of energy emitted by a participating media compared with the

energy emitted by a blackbody. Thereby, the total emittance is expressed as [Howell et al.,

2010]:

?(s) =
?
?
?
I?b??(s)d??
?
I?bd?

(4.6)

The Kirchho?'s law states that the absorbed and emitted energies must be equal: ?? = ??,

where ?? is the spectral emittance, and ?? the spectral absorptance which is de?ned by

the expression:

??(s) = 1 ?e??p?Ps (4.7)

This equation expresses the fraction of spectral intensity that has been absorbed along

a path s, where ?p? = ??/P is the absorption coe?cient based on pressure, being P

the sum of the partial pressures of the individual species of the gaseous mixture. Thus,

Equation 4.6 can be rewritten as follows:

?(s) =
?
?
?
I?b
[
1 ?e??p?Ps

]
d?

?T 4
(4.8)

For the WSGG model, the total emittance is evaluated according to the following



29

relation [Smith et al., 1982]:

?(s) =

ng?
j=0

aj(T)

[
1 ?e??p,jPs

]
(4.9)

where aj(T) is the weighting factor for each gray gas, based on the gas temperature;

j = 0 represents the spectral windows for which the absorption coe?cient is null, and

ng indicates the number of gray gases. The weighting factor, aj(T), may be physically

interpreted as the fraction of the blackbody energy in the range of the spectrum in which

the gray gas has a pressure absorption coe?cient ?p,j. Another interpretation for aj(T)

and ?p,j is that they are the numerical values that yield the better ?t of Equation 4.9.

The coe?cients aj(T) can be represented by polynomial functions [Smith et al., 1982]:

aj(T) =
K?
k=0

bj,kT
k (4.10)

in which bj,k is the polynomial coe?cient of kth order for the jth gray gas. Despite the

transparent window having a null absorption coe?cient, the weighting factor must be

di?erent from zero to assure that radiation energy is conserved:

a0 = 1 ?
ng?
j=1

aj (4.11)

To solve Equation 4.9 - 4.11 the ?p,j and bj,k coe?cients for H2O/CO2 mixtures

have been proposed in the last years [Galarça et al., 2008; Kangwanpongpan et al., 2012;

Dorigon et al., 2013]. In this work was adopted the Dorigon et al., 2013 correlations for

a partial pressure ratio between H2O and CO2 (pw/pc) equal to 2, as shown in Table 4.1.

Such correlations are valid for a temperature range from 400 K to 2500 K, and for the

pressure path lengths Ps of Equations 4.7 - 4.9 between 0.001 atm.m and 10 atm.m.

It was shown by Modest, 1991 that the WSGG model can be used with any method

of solution of the RTE, which assumes the following form:

dIj(x)

dx
= ??j(x)Ij(x) + ?j(x)aj(x)Ib(x) (4.12)

In this equation, Ij and ?j are the intensity and the absorption coe?cient associated

with the jth gray gas; Ib = ?T 4/? is the blackbody intensity, which is the Planck's

distribution law. For a H2O/CO2 mixture, the coe?cient ?j can be rewritten as ?m,i to

have the contribution of each participating gas: ?m,i = ?w,j + ?c,k, being kw,j and kc,k

the gray gas absorption coe?cient for H2O and CO2, respectively. Considering a gaseous

mixture con?ned between two parallel surfaces, Equation 4.12 can be written for positive

and negative directions, according to the discrete ordinates method [Cassol et al., 2014;

Modest, 2013]:

µl

= ??j(x)I+j,l(x) + ?j(x)aj(x)Ib(x) (4.13)

?µl
dI?j,l(x)

dx
= ??j(x)I?j,l(x) + ?j(x)aj(x)Ib(x) (4.14)

in which µl is the cosine of the polar angle ?l in the l direction, I
+
j,l and I

?
j,l are the

radiation intensities of the gray gas j for µl &gt; 0 and µl &amp;lt;0, respectively. Whereas the

walls are black with known temperatures, the boundary conditions for Equations 4.13

and Equation 4.14 at positions x = 0 and x = L are, respectively, I+j,l(0) = aj(0)Ib(0) and

I?j,l(L) = aj(L)Ib(L).

Solving Equations 4.13 and 4.14, the radiative heat ?ux and heat source, q”R and

?qR, respectively, at a position x, can be determined as [Cassol et al., 2014; Dorigon et al.,

2013]:

4.2.1 Superposition Method

The correlations obtained for the standard WSGG model usually are for a constant

partial pressure ratio between the participating species or when this ratio presents a little

variation. Cassol et al., 2014 applied the superposition method as a way to eliminate

this restriction. This approach consists of ?rst setting up independent correlations for

each species, which are then superposed to form the WSGG correlations for the mixture.

Thus, it is possible to compute the radiative heat transfer in mixtures with arbitrary

concentrations, allowing for local variations in the mole ratios, and the inclusion of any

number of participating species.

According to the superposition method, for a mixture of water vapor and carbon

dioxide, the gray gas absorption coe?cient is a sum of a given combination of gray gases

absorption coe?cient of the components, and the weighting factor will be the product of

their respective weighting factors. These de?nitions are represented by the expressions:

?m,i = ?w,j + ?c,k (4.17)

am,i(T) = aw,j(T) ×ac,k(T) (4.18)

where ?w,j and ?c,k are the local absorption coe?cients for the jth and the kth gray

gas of H2O and CO2, respectively; aw,j(T) and ac,k(T) are the corresponding weighting

factors. Such method is similar to the implementation realized by Smith et al., 1987 for

the WSGG model combining H2O and CO2 with soot, and was also applied to the SLW

model development for H2O/CO2 mixtures [Denison and Webb, 1995b].

Since this methodology requires the correlations of the individuals species, in this

work it is adopted those found by Cassol et al., 2014 for H2O and CO2. These correlations,

described in Tables 4.2 and 4.3, are valid for temperatures between 400 K and 2500 K,

and 0.001 atm.m to 10 atm.m.

4.2.2 Proposition of a Reduced Superposition Method

The superposition method applied to the WSGG has proved to be a good alterna-

tive for radiative transfer prediction in participating media, and has been applied recently

in some works [Centeno et al., 2016, 2018; Fraga et al., 2017]. However, this approach

needs to be better investigated when used for the radiative transfer prediction in com-

bustion gases. In this case, the main challenge is the combination of participating species

since it requires increasing computational e?ort as the components number increase. For

combustion problems modeling, the thermal radiation calculation needs to be coupled

with other complex phenomena such as chemical kinetic and turbulence. Thereby, any

computational cost improvement in the thermal radiation prediction is of great relevance.

Considering a H2O/CO2 mixture, the present proposition is based on the absorp-

tion coe?cient of each specie. Let ?w,j and ?c,k be the absorption coe?cient of the H2O

and CO2, respectively, and j and k varying from 0 (transparent window) to ng (number

of gray gaes). Thus, the main assumption for the reduced superposition method can be

written as: ???
??
?w,j &gt;&gt; ?c,k, if j &gt; k

?w,j&amp;lt;&amp;lt;?c,k, if j &amp;lt;k
(4.19)

This assumption can be obtained from the analysis of the WSGG correlations [Cassol

et al., 2014], observing that the ?w,j and ?c,j coe?cients are given as follows:???
??
?w,j = pw?p,j

?c,k = pc?p,k

(4.20)

where pw and pc are the partial pressures of H2O and CO2, respectively; ?p,j and ?p,k are

accordingly the pressure absorption coe?cient which are found in the literature [Cassol



33

et al., 2014], and as shown in Tables 4.2 and 4.3, they are arranged in order of magnitude

that makes the assumption of Equation 4.19 possible.

It is fundamental to emphasize the relevance of the partial pressure of the partici-

pating species (pw and pc). The assumption of the Equation 4.19 is valid when the partial

pressure ratio (pw/pc), from Equation 4.20, is on scale with 1 (pw/pc ? 1). Otherwise, if

pw/pc ratio is much larger or much smaller, the proposed reduced superposition method

may not accurately predict the radiative transfer. In such a case it is necessary to evaluate

if the regions where this happens are important or not to the thermal radiation.

In Figure 4.3 there is a representation of the proposed reduced superposition

method. The combination of two absorption coe?cients of H2O (?w,j) with those of

CO2 (?c,k) is shown in Figure 4.3(a), where the subscripts j and k are varying from 0

(transparent window) to 4 (number of gray gases). In the case where j = k the absorption

coe?cient of the two species has the same magnitude, and, then, the absorption coe?cient

i of the mixture, ?m,i, will have the contribution of both the H2O and the CO2 absorption

coe?cients. The same happens for the weighting factor of the mixture, am,i(T), forming

then one gray gas. This assumption can be summarized by the following expression:

if j = k

???
??
?m,i = ?w,j + ?c,k

am,i(T) = aw,j(T) ×ac,k(T)
(4.21)

(a) (b)

Figure 4.3 ? Reduced superposition approach for the arrangement of (a) H2O coe?cients

with those of CO2, and for the arrangement of (b) CO2 coe?cients with those of H2O.

Each of the combinations for which j &gt; k will also form one gray gas. However,

these gray gases will have the same absorption coe?cient, which is ?w,j. This happens

because the H2O absorption coe?cients will be much larger than those of CO2, and, then,

will predominate. Since all combinations have the same absorption coe?cient, it will



34

generate one unique gray gas i of the mixture, with absorption coe?cient ?w,j. Thus,

for this gray gas i, the absorption coe?cient, ?m,i, and the weighting factor, am,i(T), are

given as:

if j &gt; k

????
???
?m,i = ?w,j

am,i(T) = aw,j(T) ×
[
1 ?

?4
k+1 ac,k(T)

] (4.22)
In Equation 4.22, for CO2, all the arrangements together will form a fraction of the

blackbody energy, represented by the term [1?
?4

k+1 ac,k(T)], in the range of the spectrum

where the gray gas of the mixture has the absorption coe?cient ?w,j. Thereby, considering,

for instance, all the possible arrangements of the absorption coe?cient ?w,4 of H2O with

those of CO2 in Figure 4.3, it will be formed only two gray gases of the mixture.

For the combinations of the CO2 absorption coe?cient with those of H2O, remains

the scheme of the Figure 4.3(b) showed for two CO2 absorption coe?cients. As can be

seen, there are only the combinations for j &amp;lt;k since those for j = k have already been

accounted in the arrangement of Figure 4.3(a). Observing this, the absorption coe?cient

and the weighting factor for the H2O/CO2 mixture, ?m,i and am,i(T), are expressed as

follows:

if j &amp;lt;k

????
???
?m,i = ?c,k

am,i(T) = ac,k(T) ×
[
1 ?

?4
j+1 aw,j(T)

] (4.23)
Considering the application of the standard superposition method for a mixture

of H2O/CO2, the number of gray gases, adding the transparent windows, will be i =

(j + 1) × (k + 1). In this relation, the correlations adopted for H2O and CO2 leads to

j = k = 4, then i = 25. However, if the proposed reduced superposition is adopted i is

reduced to 13. This result is of great relevance when concerning computational e?ort. The

radiative transfer equation (RTE) is solved approximately only half of the time needed to

obtain the solution by means of the standard superposition method. Moreover, it gains

even more importance when it is working with more than two participating species. In

the case of three components, the RTE should be solved 125 times applying the standard

superposition method. Since the combustion system modeling requires the consideration

of even more components, the computational time increases signi?cantly for the solution

the RTE. Because of it, it is important the development of methodologies like the one

presented in this work, which are capable of decreasing the computational e?ort.

4.3 Spectral-Line Weighted-Sum-of-Gray-Gases

Derived from the formulation of the WSGG model proposed by Modest, 1991, the

Spectral-Line Weighted-Sum-of-Gray-Gases (SLW) model allows for a further detailing in

the treatment of the radiation spectrum, gases mixtures, and non-isothermal and non-

homogeneous media. This model, ?rst introduced by Denison and Webb, 1993b, replaces

the traditional LBL spectral integration over the wavenumber with an integration over the

spectral absorption cross-section. Numerically, it means a discretization of the spectral

absorption cross-section. The RTE has the same form as that of the WSGG model,

di?ering only in the way of calculating the gray gases absorption coe?cient and the

correspondent weighting factors, which are obtained with the absorption line blackbody

distribution function (ALBDF). For a non-scattering media, the RTE becomes, then:

dIj(x)

dx
= ??j(x)Ij(x) + ?j(x)aj(x)Ib(x) (4.24)

where ?j and aj are the absorption coe?cient and the weighting factor for each gray gas,

respectively.

The ALBDF is de?ned as the fraction of the blackbody energy in the portions of

the spectrum where the high-resolution spectral absorption cross-section of the gas C?

is less than the prescribed value C, as illustrated in Figure 4.4. The dark-gray hatches

represent the portions of the spectrum where the Planck's function (Eb?) is integrated.

The ALBDF can be expressed as [Denison and Webb, 1995c]:

F(C,Tb,Tg,PT ,Y ) =
1

?T 4b

?
i

?
??i

Eb?(?,Tb)d? (4.25)

in which ? is the Stephan-Boltzmann constant and Eb? is Planck's function evaluated

at the wavenumber ? and blackbody temperature Tb. The subscript i refers to the ith

spectral segment and the summation is performed over the all segments for which C?&lt;C,

covering the entire spectrum. The dependence of the ALBDF on the spectrum is given

by the spectral intervals ??i, which are dependent on the absorption cross-section, gas

temperature Tg, the total pressure PT , and the species concentration Y . This distribution

function monotonically increases from 0 to 1 with increasing absorption cross section.

The discretization of C? results in the called supplemental absorption cross sections,

whose values are logarithmically spaced between the minimum and maximum values of



36

Figure 4.4 ? Representation of part of the spectrum in which the ALBDF is calculated

[adapted from Solovjov et al., 2016].

C?. Each discrete increment of C? is represented by a single absorption cross section Cj

or a single gray gas. Thus, for each gray gas, the fraction of blackbody energy, aj, for

a given source temperature, is computed as the di?erence of two distribution functions

evaluated at the supplementals absorption cross sections C?j and C?j+1:

aj = F(C?j+1,Tb,Tg,PT ,Y ) ?F(C?j,Tb,Tg,PT ,Y ) (4.26)

The application of the SLW model to non-isothermal and/or non-homogeneous

media is made through scaling approximations, wherein a non-isothermal and/or non-

homogeneous gas is replaced with an equivalently absorbing isothermal homogeneous gas.

The most known is the Curtis-Godson approximation [Godson, 1953]. Goody and Yung,

1989 showed that the scaling approximations are exact if the high-resolution absorption

cross section can be expressed as the product of two functions [Denison and Webb, 1995c]:

C?(Tg,PT ,Y ) = ?(Tg,PT ,Y )?(?) (4.27)

where ? and ? de?ne the spatial and the spectral dependence of the absorption cross

section, respectively. For non-isotherm and/or non-homogeneous problems, the spectral

integration of the RTE leads to the appearance of the additional so-called Liebnitz terms

[Denison and Webb, 1993b], which makes the analysis complicated . However, employing

the scaling approximation, these terms vanish, and, therefore, the RTE can be solved with



37

arbitrary solution methods.

The employment of the scaling approximation can be analyzed through Figure 4.5.

In this ?gure there is a high-resolution portion of an ideal spectrum of a gas described

by Equation 4.27 at two di?erent thermodynamic states. The spectrum at the state 1 is

represented by temperature Tg1, total pressure PT1, and molar fraction Y1. For this state,

the ALBDF may be calculated by integrating Planck's function over all spectral segments

where C?(Tg1,PT1,Y1) is less than the prescribed value Cj(Tg1,PT1,Y1). The stated 2

is described by temperature Tg2, total pressure PT2, and molar fraction Y2. Then, if the

Equation 4.27 is valid, the absorption cross section of the state 2, Cj(Tg2,PT2,Y2), is given

as [Denison and Webb, 1995c]:

Cj(Tg2,PT2,Y2) = Cj(Tg1,PT1,Y1)
?(Tg2,PT2,Y2)

?(Tg1,PT1,Y1)
(4.28)

This result is due to function ?(?) be independent of the gas state, according to Equa-

tion 4.27.

Figure 4.5 ? Idealized dependence of high resolution spectrum on two di?erent

thermodynamics states, resulting in equivalent blackbody energy fractions [adapted

from Solovjov et al., 2017].

As can be observed in Figure 4.5, the spectral segments de?ned where C?(Tg1,PT1,Y1)

is less than the prescribed value Cj(Tg1,PT1,Y1) are identical to those spectral segments

where C?(Tg2,PT2,Y2) is less than Cj(Tg2,PT2,Y2). Thereby, from the de?nition of the



38

ALBDF, there is an equality between the ALBDFs of the two thermodynamic states for

a given blackbody temperature, established by the following expression:

F
[
Cj(Tg2,PT2,Y2); Tb = Tref ; Tg = Tg2; Y = Y2; PT = PT2

]
= F

[
Cj(Tg1,PT1,Y1); Tb = Tref ; Tg = Tg1; Y = Y1; PT = PT1

] (4.29)
where Tref is a reference temperature. This equation provides an implicit dependence

of Cj on the local gas state. Thus, the local absorption cross section Cj is determined

from the following implicit equation, which is the Equation 4.29 written for equivalent

absorption-line blackbody functions at the reference and the local states [Denison and

Webb, 1995c]:

F
[
Cj; Tb = Tref ; Tg = Tloc; Y = Yloc; PT = Ploc

]
= F

[
Cj,ref ; Tb = Tref ; Tg = Tref ; Y = Yref ; PT = Pref

] (4.30)
in which the "ref" and "loc" terms means the reference and the local values, respectively,

of each variable. Equation 4.30 is known as the reference approach [Solovjov and Webb,

2000; Solovjov et al., 2014, 2017] which assumes an ideal spectrum producing scaling of the

spectrum in non-uniform media. Under this assumption, the intervals of integration can

then be ?xed for each spatial position, eliminating the Leibnitz terms. Since Equation 4.30

is implicit, Cj must be determined at each spatial location from an iterative technique

such as bisection (adopted in this work) or Newton-Raphson [Denison and Webb, 1995c].

For Solovjov and Webb, 2010 the reference approach provides satisfactory results when

the spatial temperature gradients are not too high.

According to Denison and Webb, 1995c the reference state can be determined as the

spatial average of the temperature, total pressure, and composition ?elds. The reference

absorption cross section, Cj,ref in Equation 4.30, is an appropriate value between the

supplemental absorption cross sections C?j and C?j+1, which are logarithmically spaced.

Thus, if su?cient gray gases (20 or more) are used, Cj,ref may be determined as the

logarithmic mean of C?j and C?j+1:

Cj,ref = exp

[
ln(C?j) + ln(C?j+1)

2

]
(4.31)

The local gray gas absorption coe?cient ?j is a function of the local molar density

N, determined from an appropriate equation of state, and the local gray gas absorption



39

cross section Cj:

?j = NY Cj (4.32)

where Y is the local molar fraction of each participating specie.

Since the fraction of blackbody energy of each gray gas, aj, has already been de?ned

in Equation 4.26, remains to set the appropriated values of the gas temperature, total

pressure, and mole fraction to calculate aj. Denison and Webb, 1995c recommend that

the fraction of blackbody energy of each gray gas be calculated as follow:

aj = F(C?j+1,Tb = Tloc,Tg = Tref,PT = Pref,Y = Yref )

?F(C?j,Tb = Tloc,Tg = Tref,PT = Pref,Y = Yref )
(4.33)

For a participating media bounded by two parallel surfaces, Equation 4.24 can be

written for positive and negative directions, according to the discrete ordinates method

[Cassol et al., 2014; Modest, 2013]:

µl
dI+j,l(x)

dx
= ??j(x)I+j,l(x) + ?j(x)aj(x)Ib(x) (4.34)

?µl
dI?j,l(x)

dx
= ??j(x)I?j,l(x) + ?j(x)aj(x)Ib(x) (4.35)

in which µl is the the cosine of the angle ?l in l direction, I
+
j,l and I

?
j,l are the radiation

intensities for the gray gas j for µl &gt; 0 and µl &amp;lt;0, respectively. Considering that the

walls are black with known temperatures, the boundary conditions for Equation 4.34 and

Equation 4.35 at the positions x = 0 and x = L are, respectively, I+j,l(0) = aj(0)Ib(0) and

I?j,l(L) = aj(L)Ib(L).

Solving Equations 4.34 and 4.35, the radiative heat ?ux and the heat source, q”R

and ?qR, respectively, at position x, can be determined as [Cassol et al., 2014; Dorigon

et al., 2013]:

q”R(x) =

where the summation over all gray gases (ng) represent the spectral integration in the

SLW model.

4.3.1 SLW Modeling of Gas Mixture

In the SLW model, when it is considered more than one participating specie Equa-

tions 4.30 - 4.33 must be solved for each specie. Thereby, for a mixture of H2O and CO2,

the absorption coe?cient is given as:

?m,i = ?w,j + ?c,k (4.38)

where ?w,j and ?c,k are the local absorption coe?cients for the jth and the kth gray gas of

H2O and CO2, respectively. The value of ?w,j and ?c,k is calculated using Equation 4.32.

The direct method is considered to be the most accurate approach for treatment

of mixtures in the SLW model [Solovjov et al., 2011b]. This method was developed by

Denison and Webb, 1995b for binary mixtures, and later extended to multicomponent

gas mixtures [Solovjov and Webb, 2000, 2001]. This approach consists of obtaining the

ALBDF separately for each specie. Thus, the weighting factor of H2O and CO2 can be

written as follow, respectively:

aw,j = Fw(C?j+1,Tb,Tg,PT ,Y ) ?Fw(C?j,Tb,Tg,PT ,Y ) (4.39)

ac,k = Fc(C?j+1,Tb,Tg,PT ,Y ) ?Fc(C?j,Tb,Tg,PT ,Y ) (4.40)

in which Fw and Fc are the ALBDFs for H2O and CO2, respectively. The values of the

ALBDF are calculated for each local mole concentration and temperature.

Finally, the weighting factor for the mixture, used in the RTE, is given by the

product of the two individual weights:

am,i = aw,j ×ac,k (4.41)

Such approach assumes that the spectra of the individual species are statistically uncor-

related. Including the transparent window, the weighting factor for the mixture must

satisfy the relation:
ng?
i=0

am,i = 1 (4.42)



41

4.4 Summary

The most accurate radiative transfer prediction in participating media is made

with the LBL spectral integration of the RTE. However, this method spends a high com-

putational time since it is needed to solve the RTE for hundreds of thousands of spectral

lines. The WSGG model came up as a possible alternative. The attractiveness of this

method is its relatively simple formulation and implementation with satisfactory accuracy

depending on the problem under analysis. The application of the WSGG model consists

on ?rst generating the participating gases correlations, which can be obtained for a mix-

ture or for the individual species. The advantage of the individual correlations for each

gas is that the radiative problems can be solved for variable partial pressure ratios along

the spatial position. For a gas mixture, the combination of the individual correlations is

made through the known superposition approach. In this work is proposed the reduced

superposition method focused on the computational e?ort reduction. The superposition

method is also used in the SLW model. This method, more complex and detailed, is

based on the absorption line blackbody energy distribution function (ALBDF) calculated

for each participating specie through its detailed spectrum. Thus, the ALBDFs can be

used to calculate the weighting factors of the mixture.

5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

5.1 Analyze Between the LBL Solution and the WSGG and SLW Models

After describing the theory of the Gas Models of interest in this work, now it will

be applied to the radiative transfer calculation in participating gases. In this chapter

will be shown results considering two kinds of non-isothermal problems: homogeneous

and non-homogeneous media. For each of them the solutions are carried out ?rst for

the individual species, and next for the mixture. The SLW and WSGG solutions for a

one-dimensional gas layer are compared against the LBL benchmark solutions in order to

evaluate the accuracy of these models.

5.1.1 Radiative Transfer in Non-isothermal, Homogeneous Media

The radiative heat transfer in non-isothermal homogeneous media is now inves-

tigated. The solutions are performed using the SLW and WSGG models for a one-

dimensional gas layer bounded with two black walls, which are separated by one meter.

The results are shown for the radiative heat ?ux and the heat source for which the LBL

integration serves as the benchmark solution in the comparison. The molar concentra-

tions of the gases are assumed to be constant and equal to 0.1 for carbon dioxide (CO2),

and 0.2 for water vapor (H2O). In all cases the total pressure is 1 atm, and a spatial

discretization of 200 points for the grid was used. Furthermore, the discrete ordinates

method (DOM) [Cassol et al., 2014; Modest, 2013] was applied for the angular discretiza-

tion: 40 directions were used for the LBL, 8 for the SLW, 8 for WSGG that uses the

Cassol et al., 2014 coe?cients and 30 directions for WSGG that uses the Dorigon et al.,

2013 coe?cients. Previous works show that these spatial and angular discretizations are

enough to ensure the solutions independence. [Dorigon et al., 2013; Cassol et al., 2014;

Brittes, 2015; Fonseca et al., 2018; Coelho and França, 2018]. For the WSGG model, 4

gray gases for each participating specie were used, as found in the literature. In the SLW

formulation, 20 gray gases were adopted since above of this number the solutions does

not vary signi?cantly.

To evaluate the spectral models approached in this work, three temperature pro?les



43

were adopted, described as follows:

T(x?) = 400 + 1400sin2(?x?) (5.1)

T(x?) = 400 + 1400sin2(2?x?) (5.2)

T(x?) =

in which x? = x/L, being x the local position, and L the distance between the walls.

are the maximum absolute values of the radiative heat ?ux and heat source for each case

under analysis. Of special interest in the discussion will be the maximum deviations, ?max

and ?max, and the average deviations, ?avg and ?avg, in the domain.

For the three cases presented in this section, two situations are considered. First,

the problems are solved for individual species, and, next, for the mixture using both the

WSGG and the SLW models. In the WSGG model, the solution for individual species is

obtained with the Cassol et al., 2014 coe?cients, while for the mixture is adopted both

the Dorigon et al., 2013 (pw/pc = 2) and the Cassol et al., 2014 coe?cients. In Case 1,

the temperature pro?le varies symmetrically in the domain, with the temperature ranging

from 400 K on the walls to 1800 K in the mid distance between the walls. In Figures 5.2-

5.4 are shown the radiative heat ?ux and the heat source for a layer of CO2, H2O and

H2O/CO2 mixture, respectively.

As can be seen in these ?gures, for all these problems the radiative heat ?ux is null

in the middle of the domain due to the symmetry of the temperature pro?le. Since the

radiative heat ?ux is directed from the higher temperature of the medium to the walls,

the heat ?ux is positive for x? &gt; 0.5, and negative for x? &amp;lt;0.5. The radiative heat source

has a peak at x? = 0.5 where the temperature is at its maximum, and the negative sign

means that the medium is losing energy due to radiation. For CO2, the WSGG model

presents a worst agreement with the LBL near to the walls for both the radiative heat ?ux

and the heat source. The radiative heat ?ux of H2O presents a behavior similar to that

of CO2, while the maximum radiative heat source deviation occurs in the mid distance

between the walls, such as happens for the H2O/CO2 mixture. For the problems of Case

1, the radiative heat ?ux deviations for the SLW model has also its maximum value in

the middle of the domain.

The SLW and WSGG maximum and average deviations with respect to LBL in-

tegration are shown in Table 5.2. For CO2, with the WSGG model, the maximum and

average deviations found for the radiative heat ?ux were of 11.53 % and 3.46 %, respec-

tively. For the heat source the maximum deviation is 6.72 %, and 4.17 % for the average.

When the SLW model is considered, it is seen (Table 5.2) that in average it has a better

the maximum deviation of 7.59 % occurs in the middle of the domain. When the par-

ticipating gas is H2O, the deviations increase signi?cantly if compared to those of CO2

for both the WSGG and the SLW models. However, surprisingly the WSGG maximum

radiative heat source deviation is smaller than that for the SLW model for both the H2O

and the CO2.

The calculations for the H2O/CO2 mixture shows that the Dorigon et al., 2013

coe?cients (pw/pc = 2) provides much better agreement with the LBL integration than

the superposition methodology applied to both the WSGG and the SLW models. This

happens because the superposition approach is a coupling method for the mixture from

individual participating species coe?cients, and it introduces approximations that are

not found when the mixture is made before obtaining the coe?cients. Besides that, using

the WSGG coe?cients for mixture, the RTE is solved only for 4 gray gases and one

transparent window, while with the superposition method the RTE is solved 25 times in

the WSGG model, and 441 times in the SLW model. Except for the maximum radiative

heat source deviation of the mixture, the WSGG model employing the superposition

method leads to higher deviations than SLW. Moreover, there is another interesting point

to notice: the WSGG for H2O/CO2 (pw/pc = 2) mixture solution has a relevant smaller

deviation if compared to the maximum deviations found for individual species.

The Cases 2 and 3 share some conclusions with Case 1 in such a way that only the

deviations are shown in this section. The graphics for the radiative heat ?ux and the heat

source can be seen in detail in the Appendix A. Tables 5.3 and 5.4 show the deviations

for Cases 2 and 3, where it can be seen that, except for the WSGG heat source deviations

of Case 2, the CO2 deviations are smaller than those of H2O for both the WSGG and

the SLW models, and, in average, the WSGG deviations found for the individual species

are greater than those of SLW, as happens in Case 1. As can be noted, the superposition

method applied to the WSGG model of Case 2 leads to deviations very closed to those of

SLW, indicating that even with just 4 gray gases the WSGG model can be competitive

depending on the case under study. For these two cases, the mixture with the Dorigon

et al., 2013 coe?cients (pw/pc = 2) also yields the smaller deviations if compared with

the LBL benchmark solutions.

5.1.2 Radiative Transfer in Non-isothermal, Non-homogeneous Media

In real combustion systems the molar concentration of the participating gases is

not homogeneous, which means that it varies in the spatial position. For this reason, it

will be shown in this section some problems in which the media is non-isothermal and

non-homogeneous. The molar concentration pro?les adopted for the participating species

are described by the following equations:

YCO2 (x
?) = 0.2sin2(?x?) (5.6)

YCO2 (x
?) = 0.2sin2(2?x?) (5.7)

YCO2 (x
?) = 0.1cos2(2?x?) (5.8)

YH2O(x
?) = 0.2sin2(2?x?) (5.9)

in which x? = x/L, being x the local position, and L the distance between the walls.

Figure 5.5 presents the pro?les of these concentration as well as those of temperature.

The three test cases studied are organized in Table 5.5. All the computational parameters

are the same as those de?ned for homogeneous media in the previous section.

The ?rst two cases present a constant partial pressure ratio (pw/pc = 2) over the

domain, while for the Case 3 this ratio vary with the spatial coordinate. For Case 1, both

the temperature and the molar concentration pro?les present a double symmetry, with

two points of maximum: x? = 0.25 and x? = 0.75. The maximum temperature for this

case is 1800 K, while the minimum is 400 K and occurs in the walls and in the middle of

the domain. Because of the symmetry of the pro?les, the radiative heat ?ux is null in the

half distance between the walls. Figures 5.6-5.8 shows the radiative heat ?ux and the heat

source for a layer of CO2, H2O and H2O/CO2 mixture, respectively. For the H2O and

the H2O/CO2 mixture problems, the radiative heat ?ux presents higher deviations near

the walls, in which there are low temperatures and molar concentrations. However, such

behavior does not happens for CO2. Furthermore, in all the problems solved for Case 1,

the SLW model leads to the higher deviation of the radiative heat source in the regions

of maximum temperature and molar concentration, which was expected.

Table 5.6 shows the deviations of the WSGG and SLW models with respect to the

LBL benchmark solution, for individuals participating species and mixture of the Case

1. Considering the results of the SLW model, it can be seen that the H2O, if compared

to CO2, provides the higher deviations. Besides that, the H2O/CO2 mixture deviations

are greater than those found for individuals species, such as happens, in average, for the

WSGG (superposition). Unlike SLW, the H2O deviations for WSGG model has a higher

value than those for CO2 only for the radiative heat ?ux, while the maximum and average

deviations for the radiative heat source are 8.81 % and 2.46 %, respectively. Moreover, it

can be noted that the superposition methodology applied to the WSGG yields, in average,

the smaller deviations than SLW, and it also is truth for the individual species. In the

comparison of the WSGG and SLW radiative heat ?ux, it can be seen that the results are

close to each other.

For Case 2, in general, when the problems are compared with each other, the con-



52

clusions have the same tendency of those derived from Case 1. Thus, only the computed

deviation for the radiative heat ?ux and the heat source are shown in this section, and

the graphics can be seen in detail in Appendix B. As can be observed in Table 5.7, except

when it is used the Dorigon et al., 2013 coe?cients, in average, the WSGG radiative heat

?ux deviations are close to those found employing the SLW model. Further, the WSGG

radiative heat source maximum deviations for H2O and H2O/CO2 (superposition) mix-

ture are lower than those found employing the SLW model: for H2O reaches 6.86 %, being

13.57 % in the SLW model; and for H2O/CO2 (superposition) this deviation is 13.54 %,

while for the SLW model it is 18.44 %. Such results show that the WSGG might compete

very well with the SLW, depending on the problem analyzed. It is very important for

the thermal radiation ?eld since the WSGG model present a formulation simpler to be

implemented than SLW.

When the partial pressure ratio (pw/pc) is not constant over the domain, the dis-

agreements between the WSGG and the SLW models are more pronounced. This behavior

can be observed in Case 3 which was also solved for the individual species as well as for

the mixture. The temperature and H2O molar concentration pro?les reach the maximum

values at the positions x? = 0.25 and x? = 0.75. On the other hand, in these same

locations, the CO2 molar concentration has the lowest value, which allows for the vari-

able partial pressure ratio pw/pc. The radiative heat ?ux and heat source for CO2, H2O,



53

and H2O/CO2 mixture are found in Figures 5.9-5.11, respectively. For the solution of

the individual species, the radiative heat ?ux calculation obtained with WSGG model

presents the worst results near the walls. The radiative heat source deviation for CO2 has

its maximum value in the middle of the domain where there is a peak of concentration,

and a minimum of temperature; while for H2O the location where there are the maximum

deviations does not coincides with that of maximum temperature or molar concentration.

For all the problems of Case 3 it is seen that the SLW model is signi?cantly

more accurate than WSGG. It can also be veri?ed in the deviations shown in Table 5.8.

One interesting point to note is that the WSGG (pw/pc = 2) solution furnish the worst

results for the radiative heat source, as found by Cassol et al., 2014. That is expected

since the Dorigon et al., 2013 coe?cients are generated under the conditions that the

partial pressure ratio between the species is 2/1 in all positions in the medium, while

in fact the concentration of H2O is much smaller than that of CO2 in the middle of

the slab. However, among the solutions, such coe?cients provides the best result for

the radiative heat ?ux, having the advantage that it require the RTE to be solved only

for four gray gases and one transparent window, while with the superposition method

the RTE is solved 25 times in the WSGG model, and 441 times in the SLW model.

As seen in the graphics, WSGG (pw/pc = 2) overpredicted the absolute value of the

radiative heat source in the half distance between the walls. The opposite e?ect takes

place in the vicinity of x? = 0.2 and 0.8, where the use of the WSGG (pw/pc = 2)

underpredicted the actual amount of H2O, which is a more e?ective absorber-emitter

than CO2, leading to an underestimation of the absorption of radiation from the higher



55

temperature regions in the medium. Another observation is that, for the mixture made

through the superposition method, the deviations found are very close to the maximum

deviations found for the individual species, or even smaller, in both the SLW and the

WSGG models. This behavior does not appears when the partial pressure ratio (pw/pc)

is constant, for which the H2O/CO2 mixture deviations expressively increase if compared

to those of individuals species.

5.1.3 Summary

The radiative heat transfer calculation was made in a one-dimensional gas layer.

For this, both the WSGG and the SLW models were used. The results were compared

against the LBL benchmark solutions in order to evaluate the accuracy of these models.

The problems were solved for CO2 and H2O individually, and for H2O/CO2 mixtures

considering a non-isothermal homogeneous or non-homogeneous media. In the WSGG

model, the Cassol et al., 2014 coe?cients were adopted for the individual participating

species. These same coe?cients were used for the mixture as well as to those of Dorigon

et al., 2013. For both the homogeneous and the non-homogeneous media, when pw/pc

ratio is constant, the results have shown that for both the WSGG and the SLW models,

the H2O deviations, in average, are higher than those found for CO2. Furthermore, for

homogeneous media, the WSGG deviations for individual species are signi?cantly greater

than those of SLW, except for the radiative heat source maximum deviation of H2O;



56

while for mixtures, when the superposition approach is used, WSGG model can provide

results as accurate as the SLW model depending on the problem under analysis. In all the

cases where the partial pressure ratio is constant (pw/pc = 0.2) the Dorigon et al., 2013

coe?cients provide the better agreement with the LBL solution. It happens because the

superposition approach is a coupling method for the mixture from individual participating

species coe?cients, and it introduces same approximations that are not found when the

mixture is made before obtaining the coe?cients. On the other hand, in the case where

the partial pressure ratio is not constant over the domain, the superposition method

yields the lowest deviations for the radiative heat source. Besides that, in such condition,

the deviations for the mixture are very close to the maximum deviations found for the

individual species for both the WSGG and the SLW models, contrary to what happens

for constant partial pressure ratio.

5.2 Application of the Proposed Reduced Superposition Method

Since the proposed reduced superposition method for the WSGG model was de-

tailed in Chapter 4, now its accuracy will be evaluated in one-dimensional radiative trans-

fer problems. Furthermore, it will be evaluated the consistency of this new proposition

for the radiative transfer prediction in laminar di?usion ?ames.

5.2.1 Radiative Transfer in One-dimensional Problems

The ?rst case is a non-isothermal non-homogeneous H2O/CO2 mixture. The tem-

perature pro?le is that given by Equation 5.2, shown in Section 5.1.1. The CO2 concentra-

tion pro?le (YCO2) is described by Equation 5.7 in Section 5.1.2, being that YH2O = 2YCO2.

Thus, the partial pressure ratio (pw/pc) between the species is constant through the do-

main and equal to 2.

For this case, the radiative heat ?ux and heat source were computed. Theses

quantities were calculated using the WSGG model. Therefore, were adopted the standard

superposition method [Cassol et al., 2014] and the reduced superposition method proposed

in this work. The solutions obtained with these two approaches are compared against the

LBL integration. As can be seen in Figure 5.12, there is no visible di?erence between

the standard and the reduced superposition method solutions for both the radiative heat

?ux and the heat source. The disagreement between the solutions is only found when



57

the normalized deviations with respect to the LBL benchmark solutions are computed,

as shown in Table 5.9. For the radiative heat ?ux, the maximum normalized deviation

found with the standard and the reduced superposition method were 12.40 % and 12.33

%, respectively; accordingly, the maximum deviations for the radiative heat source were

13.22% and 12.38%.

in Section 5.1.2. Unlike ?rst case, in this one the partial pressure ratio (pw/pc) between

the participating species vary along the spatial position. The results for the radiative heat

?ux and heat source are shown in Figure 5.13, and again it can be seen that the standard

and the reduced superposition method provide coincident solutions. When compared with

the LBL solution, the deviations found are those presented in Table 5.10. For the radia-

tive heat ?ux the maximum normalized deviation applying the standard and the reduced

superposition method are 14.48% and 13.92%, respectively. Extending these calculations

for the radiative heat source, the maximum deviation are, accordingly, 9.58% and 9.18%.

superposition method for radiative transfer prediction in combustion gases. Considering

the standard superposition method, for a H2O/CO2 mixture, the RTE must be solved

25 times. Employing the reduced superposition method this number is reduced to 13.

As already discussed in Chapter 4, this result is of great relevance when concerning

computational e?ort. It gains even more importance when it is working with more than

two participating species. In the case of three components, the RTE should be solved

125 times applying the standard superposition method. Since the combustion system

modeling requires the consideration of even more components, the computational time

increases signi?cantly for the computation of the radiative transfer. Despite the proposed

reduced superposition method working for one-dimensional problems, its validity also

needs to be evaluated for the radiative transfer solution in combustion systems such as

di?usion ?ames. Such discussion is the aim of the following section.

5.2.2 Evaluation of the Consistency of the Reduced Superposition Method in

Di?usion Flames

The radiative transfer prediction using the WSGG model with the reduced su-

perposition method was carried out for H2O/CO2 mixtures in one-dimensional domain

in the previous section. However, it is important to verify the consistency of this new

proposition in combustion systems, where the H2O and the CO2 are the main combustion

products. For this, it was chosen a laminar di?usion ?ame. The di?usive term means

that the fuel and the oxidant are not premixed.

The laminar di?usion ?ame has CH4 as fuel, without dilution, and air as oxidant.

For the evaluation of the consistency of the reduced superposition method it is necessary

to know the ?elds of temperature, molar concentration of H2O and CO2, as well as the

partial pressure ratio pw/pc between these species in the ?ame. As already discussed, the



60

partial pressures pw and pc are important for the absorption coe?cient calculation for

the gray gases. Moreover, the ratio between these partial pressures needs to be on scale

with 1 (pw/pc ? 1) over the domain for the proposed reduced superposition method to

be valid. Otherwise, if pw/pc ratio is much larger or much smaller, the proposed reduced

superposition method may not predict accurately the radiative transfer. In such case it is

necessary to evaluate if the regions where it happens are important or not for the thermal

radiation.

In Figure 5.14 it is shown the variables of interest in this analysis for the laminar

?ame. There is a symmetry axis at the right vertical edge. The ?ame was simulated in

the ANSYS/Fluent 18, and the results are a courtesy of the colleague Luís Gustavo Pires

Rodrigues. As can be observed in the pw/pc ?eld, there are regions where this ratio is

not on scale with 1. However, it is important to note that such regions are not relevant

from the thermal radiation point of view. That is true because the radiative transfer is

signi?cant in the regions of high temperature and molar concentrations of the participating

species. Thus, analyzing Figures 5.14 (a), (b) and (c), it can be seen that the regions of

interest for the thermal radiation are not coincident with those of very high and very low

pw/pc ratios. Thereby, even if the reduced superposition method does not work for such

conditions, the regions where that happens do not have a relevant contribution in the

radiative transfer calculation. Even if there are regions of high and low partial pressure

ratios, in average this ratio are close to 2, which is on scale with 1. To verify that, the

following expression can be used for the average partial pressure ratio computation in the

?ame:

r =

?
V
?rdV?

V
?dV

(5.10)

in which ? is given as (pw + pc)T 4, being T the local temperature; and r is the local

partial pressure ratio (pw/pc). The integration is made over each ?nite volume. Solving

this equation for the laminar ?ame, it yields r = 1.989, which satisfy the conditions for

the proposed reduced superposition to be valid.

5.2.3 Summary

In this section was veri?ed the accuracy and the consistency of the reduced superpo-

sition method proposed in this work. The radiative transfer prediction in one-dimensional

domain was performed for non-isothermal and non-homogeneous problems. In such case

it was considered both the constant and the non-constant partial pressure ratio (pw/pc)

over the spatial position. The proposed methodology provided solutions as accurate as

those found employing the standard superposition method, with the advantage that the

number of times the RTE is solved was reduced by half. In addition, it was concluded

that the reduced superposition method also is valid for the radiative transfer prediction

in laminar di?usion ?ames. Although this method does not work for very high and very

low pw/pc ratios, the regions where it happens in these ?ames are not important for the

thermal radiation calculations.

6 CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES

In this work, the radiative transfer was computed in one-dimensional problems em-

ploying both the WSGG and the SLW models. The results for the radiative heat ?ux and

the heat source were compared against the LBL benchmark solution in order to evaluate

the accuracy of these models. Therefore, its was considered non-isothermal homogeneous

and non-homogeneous media with di?erent temperature and concentration pro?les of the

participating species. The ?rst step was to solve the problems for H2O and CO2 individ-

ually, and, next, for H2O/CO2 mixtures. The objective of doing that was to compare the

accuracy of the WSGG and SLW models for several media conditions. Furthermore, the

main challenge in the superposition method is the combination of participating gases since

it requires increasing computational time as the components number increase. Thus, for

the WSGG model, it was proposed a reduced superposition method capable of reducing

the computational e?ort. Its accuracy was veri?ed in one-dimensional radiative problems.

Finally, the consistency of this new approach was proved in di?usion ?ames. The main

conclusions of this study can be summarized as follow:

• In homogeneous media, analyzing the individual species solutions, the SLW model

proved to be more accurate than WSGG. For both the WSGG and the SLW models,

the H2O normalized deviations found for the radiative heat ?ux and the heat source

were expressively higher than those for CO2. When the solution was carried out for

H2O/CO2 mixtures, the deviations, in average, reached values close to those found

for H2O (maximum deviations between the individual species). Further, the super-

position method applied to WSGG model, even with just four gray gases for each

specie, led to results very close to those of SLW depending on the problem under an-

alyze. It shows that despite the simple formulation, the WSGG model may compete

very well with more sophisticated gas models in the solutions of thermal radiation

problems. In all the test cases, for mixtures, the Dorigon et al., 2013 coe?cients

provided the best results, which make sense since such correlations were generated

speci?cally for mixtures where the partial pressure ratio (pw/pc) is constant.

• When the media is non-homogeneous, for constant partial pressure ratio, in both

the mixture and the individual species, the solutions lead to same conclusions that

those derived from homogeneous media. However, if variable partial pressure ra-



63

tio is considered, the disagreements between the WSGG and the SLW models are

more pronounced. The SLW model shown to be, in average, signi?cantly more

accurate than WSGG for both the mixture and the individual species. Moreover,

when Dorigon et al., 2013 coe?cients for mixture was applied provided the higher

deviation for the radiative heat source, and the better results for the radiative heat

?ux. This result show that these coe?cients may be a good option even when the

partial pressure ratio is not constant, depending on the result of interest, having

the advantage that it require the RTE to be solved only for four gray gases and one

transparent window, while with the superposition method the RTE was solved 25

times in the WSGG model, and 441 times in the SLW model.

• The proposed reduced superposition method applied to the WSGG model led to

solutions as good as those of the standard superposition method in the computa-

tion of the radiative transfer in one-dimensional problems for both constant and

non-constant partial pressure ratio (pw/pc). Since the combination of participating

species is the main challenge of the standard superposition method, this result is

very important for the thermal radiation prediction from combustion gases due to

the fact that the number of times need to solve the radiative transfer equation (RTE)

is reduced by half. In combustion system, where the thermal radiation calculation

need to be coupled with others complex mechanisms such as chemical kinetic and

turbulence, this computational time reduction become of great relevance.

• The consistency of the reduced superposition method in methane di?usion laminar

?ames was certi?ed. Since the proposition made in this work is valid when pw/pc ?

1, the ?elds of temperature, molar concentrations of H2O and CO2, and partial

pressure ratio (pw/pc) were analyzed. Thereby, it was veri?ed that the regions in

the ?ame where pw/pc is not in scale with 1 are not important for thermal radiation.

This phenomenon become relevant only in locations of high temperature and molar

concentrations of the participating species, and in such regions the relation pw/pc ?

1 was satis?ed.

The perspectives of this work are:

(i) It is important to extend the reduced superposition method to thermal radiation

prediction in di?usion ?ames, and, thus, analyze the accuracy of this approach in



64

such conditions;

(ii) As realized for the WSGG model, the development of a new approach for optimiza-

tion of the superposition method applied to SLW model is of great interest for the

computational e?ort reduction;

(iii) Another perspective is to couple the optimized superposition method with an ade-

quate approach to consider turbulence-radiation iterations (TRI) and soot formation

in combustion processes.

APPENDIX A ? Homogeneous media - Radiative Heat Flux and Heat Source for

Cases 2 and 3

Figures A.1, A.2, and A.3 presents the radiative heat ?ux and the heat source for

a layer of CO2, H2O and H2O/CO2 mixture, respectively, for Case 2 discussed in section

6.1.1. For this case, the temperature pro?le presents a double symmetric, with two points

of maximum: x? = 0.25 and x? = 0.75. The maximum temperature for this case is

1800 K, while the minimum is 400 K and occur in the walls and in the mid distance of

the domain. Because of the symmetry of the pro?les, the radiative heat ?ux is null in

mid distance between the walls, reaching the highest absolute values at x? = 0.125 and

x? = 0.825, where the temperature gradient is maximum. The maximum absolutes values

of the radiative heat source occurs in the regions where the temperature pro?le has its

peak; and the heat source is positive in the cold regions of the medium, indicating net

gain of radiation from the hot regions. For both the individual and the mixture problems,

the WSGG radiative heat ?ux presents higher deviations near to the walls, where there

are low temperatures. Furthermore, in all the problems, the SLW model leads to the

maximum deviation of the radiative heat source in the regions of maximum temperature.

In the H2O/CO2 mixture problem the WSGG radiative heat ?ux deviations shows to be

very close to those of the SLW model.

In Figures A.4, A.5, and A.6 are showed the radiative heat ?ux and the heat

source for a layer of CO2, H2O and H2O/CO2 mixture, respectively, for Case 3 discussed

in section 6.1.1. Contrarily to cases 1 and 2, the temperature pro?le is not symmetric,

reaching its peak at x? = 0.25. The maximum temperature is still 1800 K as with the

other cases, but the walls temperatures are no longer the same value: at x? = 0, T = 880

K, and x? = 1, T = 400 K. As can be seen, for all problems, since the temperature pro?le

is no longer symmetric, the point in which the heat ?ux is null was no longer in the mid

distance between the walls. Moreover, for the radiative heat source, the maximum for all

problems took place in x? = 0.25, which is where the temperature of the participating

species is at its peaks. For x? larger than about 0.6, where there is the lower temperature

of the domain, the radiative heat source does not have steep variations. Analyzing the

deviations, except for H2O/CO2 (pw/pc = 2) mixture, the problems solved with the

WSGG model provided the worts results than the SLW model if compared to the LBL

benchmark computation. When the results for radiative heat source is veri?ed, it is seen

that such behavior change in some cases: for H2O, the WSGG maximum deviation is

11.12 %, while for SLW achieve 13.95 %; for H2O/CO2 mixture, using the superposition

approach, the WSGG maximum deviation is 11.84 %, and for the SLW is 14.46 %. This

interesting fact shows that the WSGG model can compete in a satisfactory way with the

more sophisticated SLW model.

APPENDIX B ? Non-homogeneous media - Radiative Heat Flux and Heat Source

for Case 2

Figures B.1, B.2, and B.3 present the radiative heat ?ux and the heat source for a

layer of CO2, H2O and H2O/CO2 mixture, respectively, in non-homogeneous media, for

Case 2 discussed in section 6.1.2. The results of the radiative heat ?ux for the WSGG

model are very close to those of the SLW model for all the problems, and it is null in the

half distance between the walls where the temperature and concentration pro?les have

their peak. The maximum deviations found for the radiative heat ?ux are also at x? = 0.5

for both the individual and the mixture problems.
