Abstract  

The Gulf of Cadiz offshore SW Iberia is an area linked with episodic destructive 
seismic and tsunamigenic events, such as the M~8.8, 1st November 1755 
Lisbon earthquake among others. The association of active faults to this kind of 
high magnitude event has been extensively studied specially due to the 
contribution of several international projects for more than two decades. 
However, the meaning of the persistent small to intermediate magnitude 
seismicity recognized in this region is still particularly not fully understood. This 
is, at least, related to the lack of an accurate hypocenter location of these 
events resulting from an asymmetrical geographical distribution of the 
permanent seismic network. 

One of the main purposes of the NEAREST project (Integrated observation from 
NEAR shore sourcES of Tsunamis: towards an early warning system GOCE, 
contract n. 037110) was the identification and characterization of seismogenic 
and tsunamigenic structures in the Gulf of Cadiz area, source region of the 
Lisbon 1755 earthquake and tsunami. To address this problem 24 broadband 
Ocean Bottom Seismometers (OBS) and a seafloor multiparametric station 
GEOSTAR (Geophysical and Oceanographic Station for Abyssal Research) 
acquired between August 2007 and July 2008 passive seismic data in this 
region. The results delivered a detailed record of the local seismicity, revealing 
3 main clusters of earthquakes, two of them coinciding with the location of the 3 
larger instrumental earthquakes in the area: i) the 28th February 1969 
(Mw~8.0); ii) the 12th February 2007 (Mw=6.0) and iii) the 17th December 2009 
(Mw=5.5). Focal mechanisms show a mixed pattern, mostly strike-slip and 
reverse dip-slip with a very few normal mechanisms. The results show that  of 
the recorded events are located in the mantle (at depths between 30 and 60 
km). This implies the existence of tectonically active structures located much 
deeper than the ones mapped by Multichannel seismic reflection. 

A thorough analysis shows that the seismicity clusters are offset with respect to 
the upper crustal active thrusts. The wide-range solutions of focal mechanisms 
also imply that the related source processes are complex. This can reflect the 
interaction of different active geological features, such as faults and rheological 
boundaries. To understand these new results in the context of the seismo-
tectonics of the Gulf of Cadiz a review of some available geophysical data 
(reflection and refraction seismic profiles interpretation) in this area is presented 
as well as novel work on seismic reflection profile IAM GB1 across a rheologic 
boundary and seismicity cluster.  

Our study shows that the seismicity clusters are located at faults intersections 
mapped at the seafloor and shallow crust, suggesting that the crustal tectonic 
faults are replicated in the lithospheric mantle. These fault interferences are 



 

II 
 

associated with boundaries of lithospheric domains prone to localize stress and 
seismic strain. 

Active crustal faults are either locked or move through slow aseismic slip. 
Frictional slip in crustal faults is probably limited to high magnitude earthquakes. 
Serpentinization probably induces tectonic decoupling limiting micro-seismicity 
to depths below the serpentinized layer. It is expected that during high-
magnitude events seismic rupture is favored by weakening mechanisms and 
propagates upwards through the serpentinized layer up to the surface. 

The results obtained in this work improve our knowledge about the local 
seismicity and related active faults in the Gulf of Cadiz area, giving a new 
contribution to access to the seismic hazard in the Nubia-Iberia plate boundary 
in the Northeast Atlantic Region.

Resumo  

O Golfo de Cádis é uma região com uma sismicidade moderada embora se 
conheça, tanto no registo histórico como instrumental, eventos de elevada 
magnitude. O sismo de 1 de Novembro de 1755 é um exemplo paradigmático 
com uma magnitude estimada de 8.8 e um tsunami associado com Mt = 8.5. 

Já o sismo de 28 de Fevereiro de 1969, é o mais importante registado 
instrumentalmente, teve uma Ms de 7.9, ao qual esteve associado um pequeno 
tsunami. Mais recentemente, salientam-se os sismos de 12 de Fevereiro de 
2007, com Mw=6.0 e o de 17 de Dezembro de 2009, com Mw =5.5 (EMSC-
European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre). No entanto, a sismicidade 
nesta região é descrita como de magnitude baixa a intermédia, com uma 
distribuição em profundidade acima dos 60 km. 

Correlacionar esta sismicidade com potenciais estruturas sismogénicas no 
Golfo de Cádis constituiu um dos objectivos do projecto NEAREST (Integrated 
observation from NEAR shore sourcES of Tsunamis: towards an early warning 
system GOCE, contract n. 037110). Neste contexto, foram necessárias uma 
caracterização e localização mais precisas dos eventos sísmicos ocorridos 
nesta região, até agora limitadas pelos constrangimentos inerentes à 
distribuição geográfica das estações permanentes terrestres. Por isso, foi 
desenvolvida uma campanha de aquisição de dados contínuos utilizando uma 
rede de sismómetros de fundo do mar. 

A rede sísmica NEAREST operou de modo contínuo num período de 11 
meses, entre Agosto de 2007 Julho de 2008, integrando 24 sismómetros de 
fundo do mar (OBS) e uma estação multiparamétrica- GEOSTAR. Durante as 
campanhas de colocação e recuperação dos instrumentos, as manipulações 
dos OBS e GEOSTAR estiveram a cargo do Alfred Wegener Institute for 
Polarand Marine Research e do Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia –
INGV, respectivamente. 

Os OBS foram construídos pela K.U.M. Umwelt- und Meerestechnik Kiel 
GmbH, Germany e incorporavam sismómetros de banda larga Güralp CMG-
40T e um hidrofone. A GEOSTAR é um observatório que integra diversos 
equipamentos para a recolha de dados geofísicos e oceanográficos em 
contínuo. Nesta estação estão incluídos um sismómetro de banda larga com 3 
componentes e um hidrofone usados nesta campanha. 

As estações terrestres estão a cargo do Instituto Português do Mar e da 
Atmosfera (IPMA) e Instituto Dom Luiz (IDL) correspondendo a sismómetros de 
banda larga também com 3 componentes. Os registos nestas estações foram 
apenas utilizados para constranger as soluções dos mecanismos focais. Em 
trabalhos futuros, prevê-se a sua inclusão na localização dos eventos 
identificados pela rede NEAREST. Durante o período de aquisição foram 



 

IV 
 

registados na rede terrestre, para a área delimitada pela rede NEAREST, cerca 
de 270 sismos locais. 

Durante o período de funcionamento da rede NEAREST foram identificados 
cerca de 750 eventos observados em mais de 3 estações. Deste total 590 
sismos estavam localizados na área da rede NEAREST. A localização 
hipocentral foi testada usando diferentes metodologias e modelos de 
velocidades: a) inversão conjunta das posições hipocentrais e correcções de 
estações; b) o método das diferenças duplas e c) a inversão conjunta do 
modelo de velocidades-localizações hipocentrais e correcções de estações. 

O catálogo final inclui 443 eventos identificados em mais de 6 estações e 
localizados na área da rede NEAREST. De um modo geral, a maioria dos 
hipocentros estão localizados a mais de 30 km de profundidade, portanto no 
manto. As magnitudes locais variam entre 1.2 e 4.8.  

As localizações epicentrais e hipocentrais baseadas na rede NEAREST 
divergem das soluções conhecidas para a rede terrestre (providenciadas pelo 
IPMA), estando deslocadas para SW e sendo mais profundas. A diferença de 
profundidade pode atingir os 40 km. A campanha do projecto NEAREST 
permitiu a identificação de uma grande quantidade de eventos não detectada 
pela rede terrestre. 

Esta campanha permitiu ainda uma redefinição da distribuição da sismicidade 
na região, até então considerada difusa. Destes resultados foi possível 
reconhecer 3 enxames de sismicidade, dois destes coincidentes com 3 dos 
maiores eventos observados no registo instrumental. Tanto os sismos de 28 de 
Fevereiro de 1969 (Mw~8.0) como 12 de Fevereiro de 2007 (Mw=6.0) na 
proximidade da Falha da Ferradura e 17 de Dezembro de 2009 (ML=6.0) na 
região do canhão de São de Vicente. Os mecanismos focais do catálogo 
NEAREST são consistentes com estes eventos bem como com soluções de 
tensores de momento publicadas para esta região. 

No enxame do canhão de São Vicente é onde estão localizados a maioria dos 
eventos. Os hipocentros encontram-se a profundidades entre os 20 e os 55 km. 
A distribuição dos epicentros apresenta um alinhamento ? NE-SW ao longo do 
canhão de São Vicente e prolongando-se para o limite NE da Falha da 
Ferradura. Os mecanismos focais dominantes são de desligamento e oblíquos, 
combinando movimento de desligamento com uma menor contribuição de 
movimento inverso. Foram ainda registados raros eventos em falha normal. A 
compressão máxima é aproximadamente sub-paralela ao SHmax, com uma 
direcção ?NW-SE.  

Os epicentros localizados no enxame a SW da Falha da Ferradura, tem um 
alinhamento aproximadamente NW-SE, sub-paralelo à direcção de SHmax 
regional. Neste enxame os hipocentros são mais profundos localizando-se 
entre os 30 e os 55km. Os mecanismos focais são na sua maioria de 



 

V 
 

desligamento puro existindo alguns eventos em falha inversa e também raras 
soluções em falha normal. Importa salientar que as soluções de desligamento 
apresentam frequentemente um plano subparalelo à orientação das falhas de 
desligamento SWIM (?WNW-ESE a E-W). A compressão máxima é 
aproximadamente NW-SE e NNW-SSE, a W e E do enxame de sismicidade, 
respectivamente. As direcções de SHmax são mais uma vez coincidentes com 
a direção de compressão máxima.  

No enxame do Banco do Gorringe maioria dos sismos estão localizados no 
bordo SW deste relevo submarino, sub-paralelos à falha do Gorringe. Os 
eventos são menos profundos quando comparados com os outros dois 
enxames, na sua maioria acima dos 40 km. Os mecanismos focais são na sua 
maioria de desligamento e em falha inversa. Também neste enxame foram 
registados alguns sismos em falha normal. A direcção de compressão máxima 
e o SHmax são NNW-SSE.  

O facto de estes eventos se localizarem predominantemente no manto constitui 
um dos principais resultados deste trabalho. Neste contexto, tendo em 
consideração a profundidade dos eventos sísmicos, a correlação da 
sismicidade com as estruturas sismogénicas na região do Golfo de Cádis é 
particularmente complexa. Esta comparação foi desenvolvida com base nos 
dados de sísmica de reflexão e refração disponíveis. 

Do nosso estudo resulta que a sismicidade parece estar concentrada em zonas 
de interferência de falhas localizadas no manto subcrustal litosférico. Estas 
deverão ser uma replicação do padrão observado a níveis crustais e parecem 
ser coincidentes com transições entre diferentes domínios litosféricos. Estas 
zonas de interferência de falhas deverão ser áreas favoráveis à acumulação de 
tensões e deformação sísmica. 

As falhas activas crustais deverão estar ou bloqueadas ou movimentar-se de 
modo assísmico. A movimentação sísmica pode estar associada apenas a 
sismos de maior magnitude. A existência de níveis serpentinizados no Golfo de 
Cádis é suportada por dados de sísmica refracção e furos de sondagens 
profundas. Estes podem funcionar como planos de descolamento para as 
grandes falhas inversas, acomodando a movimentação asísmica e impedindo a 
micro-sismicidade de se propagar aos níveis crustais. Durante os sismos de 
elevada magnitude estes níveis serpentinizados deverão funcionar como zona 
enfraquecida, de baixo atrito, favorecendo a propagação da ruptura sísmica até 
à superfície. 

Os resultados obtidos neste trabalho melhoram o nosso conhecimento sobre a 
sismicidade e a sua relação com as falhas activas na região do limite de placas 
litosféricas no Golfo de Cádis, contribuindo para o estudo do risco sísmico  
associada a sismos devastadores.

I.Introduction  

The seismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz region has been classified as diffuse with 
respect to the distribution of the epicentres and intermediate in what respects 
frequency and magnitude of the events, although occasionally the area is 
stricken by strong and mega-earthquakes. Examples of these are, i) the 1st 
November of 1755 earthquake which had estimated magnitude of 8.8 (Richter, 
1958 and Johnston, 1996) that generated a large tsunami on the coast of 
Portugal, SW Spain and NW Morocco and ii) the instrumentally recorded 28th 
February 1969 earthquake that had a surface magnitude (Ms) of 7.9 (Fukao, 
1973) and a small tsunami associated with.  

In the last decades, research focussed on the mapping of seismogenic and 
tsunamigenic sources in this area through acquisition of swath bathymetry, 
multi-seismic reflection, wide-angle and refraction seismic surveys, analogue 
and numerical modelling. A remarkable improvement on the understanding of 
the tectonic activity resulted from the processing and interpretation of these 
data. However, there is still an unclear relation between the seismicity and the 
active faults identified. The accurate location of seismicity is hampered by the 
fact that the onshore seismic stations network is positioned around a semi-circle 
across south Portugal, southwest Spain and northwest Morocco. As a result 
earthquakes locations are poorly constrained, particularly for low to intermediate 
magnitude events. 

One of the main goals of the NEAREST project was the characterization of 
potential seismogenic and tsunamigenic sources located near shore in the Gulf 
of Cadiz area was. To ensure accurate seismicity identification, 24 ocean 
bottom seismometers (LOBSTER- Longterm Ocean Bottom Seismometer for 
Tsunami and Earthquake Research) and a multiparametric station – GEOSTAR 
were deployed in this area to register, in continuous, passive seismic data for 
one year. This dataset is a unique opportunity to achieve accurate earthquakes 
locations and seismic sources. Accordingly, the main objectives of this project 
are: 

i) characterize the micro-seismicity in the study area; 

ii) identify and characterize the mechanisms that control seismicity 
distribution in the area;  

iii) understand the slip distribution in the active faults, in detail the faults 
interference and strain partitioning mechanisms; 

iv) contribute to the definition of the plate boundary in the SW Iberia-NW 
Morocco region, improve rheological models and define the limits of 
the seismogenic zone.

I.1. Geodynamic setting of the study area 

The Gulf of Cadiz is located in the Eastern termination of the Azores-Gibraltar 
Fracture Zone (AGFZ), west of the Gibraltar orogenic arc and oceanic slab 
(Figure I.1). Here, the plate boundary zone between Eurasia (Iberia) – Africa 
(Nubia) has been described as diffuse because the tectonic deformation 
spreads across a broad area (Sartori et al., 1994, Zitellini et al 2009). The plate 
boundary is itself a matter of discussion because it appears that two types of 
plate boundary are present, i) a subduction zone under the Gibraltar arc 
(Gutscher et al., 2002) and ii) a transform type boundary accommodated by the 
SWIM dextral strike-slip faults (Zitellini et al., 2009). According to recent data 
the central part is floored by Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous oceanic 
lithosphere (Figure I.1). This new finding is supported by seismicity distribution 
pattern, tomography as well as refraction and wide-angle seismic profiles: 

? Preliminary results from NEAREST OBS experiment presented in 
Geissler et al. (2010). According to these authors, the depth distribution 
of the seismicity shows a pronounced pick at 50 km coherent with the 
600°C isotherm in Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous oceanic lithosphere 
(McKenzie et al., 2005). This limit would mark the base of brittle 
deformation and the seismogenic layer; 

? Monna et al., (2012) presented a three-dimensional P wave upper-
mantle tomography model for the southwest Iberian margin (and Alboran 
Sea) based on teleseismic arrival time recorded by Iberian and Moroccan 
land stations and by the NEAREST OBS network. Because this study 
included a long-term instrumental coverage at sea, it resulted in a better 
resolve of upper-mantle structure. A clear high-velocity anomaly is 
imaged under the NEAREST array underlying the Horseshoe Abyssal 
Plain. The thickness of this anomaly (?80–150 km) is compatible with an 
old oceanic lithosphere (~140 Ma, McKenzie et al., 2005) as speculated 
in Geissler et al. (2010). 

? New refraction and wide-angle seismic reflection data were acquired 
within the NEAREST project to study the crustal structure of the SW 
Iberian margin. The P2 profile, roughly N-S, is a 340 km long profile 
across from the central Gulf of Cadiz to the Variscan continental margin 
in the Algarve, Southern Portugal (see Figure I.1 for location and Figure 
I.2). The seismic velocity and crustal geometry model obtained in 
Sallarès et al.,( 2011) reveal three distinct crustal domains: a 28–30 km-
thick continental crust in the north; an abrupt transition zone and a last 
domain ?150 km-wide, with a ?7 km-thick crust of oceanic nature (&gt;140 
m.y.-old). In this last domain, absolute velocities in the bottom layer are 
lower than excepted probably due to fault related rock fracturing, 
alteration and mantle serpentinization (Sallarès et al., 2011). Local low

upper mantle velocities, between 7.8-7.9 km/s, were also identified in 
wide-angle multichannel seismic reflection profile by Gonzalez et al. 
(1996) in Iberian Atlantic Margin project (details on the project in chapter 
II).

This fragment of old oceanic crust is a remnant of a narrow oceanic basin of the 
western Alpine Tethys ocean, a transtensional corridor connecting the Tethyan 
and the Boreal seas from Jurassic to Cretaceous times. Accordingly, the first 
evidences for tectonic rifting in the area remount to Triassic times and extended 
to the early Cretaceous.  

The Mesozoic continental extension was largely controlled by late Variscan 
inherited NE-SW extensional faults bounding rifting segments and future 
abyssal plains in the Southwest Iberia (Pereira and Alves, 2013). The 500 km 
long Messejana–Plasencia Fault zone (see Figure I.1) is intruded by a ~200 My 
doleritic dyke (Youbi et al., 2003). Offshore this fault merges with the São 
Vicente Fault and plays an important role in the recorded micro-seismicity 
(Terrinha et al., 2009, Pereira and Alves, 2013).  

 
Figure I.2- NEAREST P2 Wide-angle and refraction profile, cutting across the central Gulf of 
Cadiz and extending to the Variscan continental margin in the Algarve, Southern Portugal (see 
location on Figure I.1). The top image shows the refraction profile and the bottom image is a 
schematic interpretation of the different crustal domains. Note that according to the obtained 
velocities model the ocean –continental transition is abrupt, around km 160. To the S, the profile 
revealed crustal seismic velocities probably defining a Jurassic oceanic Tethys realm. On top, a 
thick sediment cover related to the Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge ( in the referenced work 
refered as imbricated wedge, Sallarès et al., 2011). To North, upper and lower crusts define the 
continental domain. Low upper mantle velocities in the profile were related to serpentinization.  

To the South, in the Horseshoe Abyssal plain, the Horseshoe Abyssal plain 
Thrust (HAT - Martinez-Loriente et al, 2013, see Figure I.3) separates a band of 



I. Introduction

exhumed mantle (Sallarès et al., 2013) of the Gorringe Bank and Tagus 
Abyssal Plain from the Western Tethys Basin. Serpentinization in this region is 
in agreement with the refraction data results on upper mantle velocities between 
7.2–7.4 km/s of Purdy (1986). 

 
Figure I.3- NEAREST P1 Wide-angle and refraction profile, roughly NW-SE. cutting across the 
Tagus Abyssal Plain (TAP), the Gorringe Bank (GB), the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain (HAP), the 
Coral Patch Ridge (CPR) and ending at the Seine Abyssal Plain (SAP, Figure I.1 for location, 
Martinez-Loriente et al., 2013). The top image shows the refraction profile and the bottom image 
is a schematic interpretation of the different crustal domains. According to Sallarès et al. (2013), 
NW sector of is an area of exhumed serpentinized upper mantle related to the opening of the 
North Atlantic Ocean (from TAP to HAP). To the SE, from the HAP to the SAP was identified an 
Oceanic domain. The transition between the two domains is marked by the HAT -Horseshoe 
Abyssal plain Thrust.  

Between rifting episodes, the Gulf of Cadiz area is marked by several inversion 
episodes, well described in the Algarve basin, lower Jurassic, middle Jurassic to 
upper Jurassic transition and upper Jurassic to early Cretaceous (Terrinha et 
al., 2002). These transient geodynamic setting was explained by combined 
processes: thermal subsiding episodes, local inversion of the oblique 
transtensional tectonics and ridge push compression (idem).  

From Late Cretaceous-Paleogene to Miocene, the convergence between Africa 
and Iberia was accommodated by a South Iberia subduction. Srivastava et al 
(1990) proposed subduction of oceanic crust beneath Iberia in Miocene times 
based on palinspastic reconstructions of the oceanic magnetic anomalies. 
Lonergan and White (1997) and Gutscher et al. (2002, 2006) proposed for this 
region an east-dipping subduction slab below the Gibraltar Arc based on 
geometric constraints of the final consumption of the Tethyan ocean in the west 
Mediterranean and on tomography, respectively. 

Duarte et al. (2013), based on a new tectonic map, proposed ongoing 
subduction propagation west of the Gibraltar oceanic slab into the Atlantic

Ocean resulting from the propagation of compressive stresses from the 
Gibraltar Arc and stresses related to the large-scale Africa-Eurasia convergence 
(see Figure I.4). Zitellini et al. (2009) mapped a 600 km long WNW-ESE striking 
dextral strike-slip faults (SWIM Faults, Figure I.1), connecting the Gloria Fault 
oceanic plate boundary to the Rif-Tell Fault Zone in northern Africa, proposing 
that this could constitutes the present day precursor of a transcurrent plate 
boundary in the region (Figure I.5). However, Cunha et al. (2012) based on thin-
shell models for the lithosphere investigated the neotectonics of the Gulf Cadiz 
and concluded that models dominated by long SWIM faults (600km) would not 
reproduce the known deformation on the NE-SW, thrust system (e.g Horseshoe 
and Gorringe Faults). Neres et al. (2016) presented a neotectonic model 
comprising the area from the West Mediterranea across the Gloria Fault. This 
model confirms the Cunha et al (2012) results and favors the existence of an 
independent Alboran microplate. 

Present day kinematic models for the Eurasia (Iberia) – Africa (Nubia) Plate 
Boundary, in the region of the Gulf of Cadiz, estimate a convergence of 4-5 
mm/yr (Argus et al., 1989, DeMets et al., 1994, Nocquet and Calais, 2004, Stich 
et al., 2006), with an approximate WNW-ESE to NW-SE horizontal motion 
(DeMets et al., 1994, Calais et al., 2003 Fernandes et al., 2007 and Serpelloni 
et al. 2007). The average horizontal compression is defined as NW-SE, solution 
based on borehole, focal mechanisms and moment tensor analysis (Ribeiro et 
al. 1996, Borges et al., 2001, Stich et al., 2010, Heidbach et al,. 2008). Stress is 
accommodated in main active faults (see detailed descrition in section I.2) and 
major lithospheric transitions.

I.2. Main fault systems 

The main active faults in the area were described in several studies trying to 
identify the main seismogenic and tsunamigenic sources in SW Iberia (e.g 
Zitelini et al. 2001, Gutscher et al., 2002; Gràcia et al.2003, Terrinha et al. 2003, 
Zitellini et al., 2004, Stich et al, 2007, Terrinha et al., 2009). Three main 
systems are presented (Figure I.1): the accretionary wedge and subduction 
slab; the N-S to NE-SW striking thrusts system (e.g. Marquês de Pombal Fault 
and Horseshoe Fault) and the WNW-ESE striking dextral strike-slip faults 
(SWIM fault system). An outline of these structures is presented next and 
resumed in the Table I.1.

The Accretionary wedge: 

The accretionary wedge is a major westward directed shallow dipping thrust 
system, related to an active (or recently inactive) subduction zone under the 
Gibraltar Arc. In bathymetry is described as U-shaped west dipping morphology 
(e.g. Duarte et al, 2013). Internally, it is constituted by w-verging thrusts, 
stacking a sequence of deformed sediments on top of a package of 
underformed sediments, gently dipping towards the east (Figure I.6). According 
to Gutscher et al., (2002) this is tectonically driven (subduction related) rather 
than by gravity sliding along a west-dipping surface (e.g. Maldonado et al., 
1999; Torelli et al., 1997).  

The N-S to NE-SW striking thrusts system  

The N-S to NE-SW thrust faults are related to prominent escarpments and root 
deep into the basement, possibly extending into the upper mantle (Figure I.6, 
Duarte et al., 2011).  



I. Introduction 
 

9 
 

The Marquês de Pombal Fault (MPF) is a thrust fault with a trace &gt;50 km, with 
maximum uplift of 1100 m and the related deformed area is described as at 
least 100 km in length (e.g. Zitellini et al, 2001). The MPF, combined with a 
Back-Thrust Fault (BTF), were described as good candidates for the 1755 
earthquake source in Zitellini et al. (2001). In the same study, a depth 
conversion of the AR-10 profile is presented (Figure I.7), showing that the 
geometry of the MPF-BTF system is consistent with a layer of hypocenters 
distribution between 16 and 18 km in depth, marking a weakness in the crust 
with a rupture area with the same order of magnitude as the 1755 event. In 
alternative, the HF has been proposed as an additional source area which 
combined with MPF, could explain the 1755 earthquake (Ribeiro et al., 2006). 
These two main tectonic structures would be connected by a transfer fault, 
striking WNW-ESE.

Marquês de Pombal faults as well as the Accretionary Wedge. A schematic profile shows the 
relations between these structures and an east-dipping subduction zone (Profiles interpretation

Atlantic Mesozoic rift; Seismicity is from land network records from 1995 to 2000 (for details see 
figures 1-2 in Zitellini et al., 2001). 

 

The Horseshoe Fault (HF) is a NE-SW striking thrust fault, deeply-rooted, 
cutting through the basement down to the Moho (?) (see Figure I.8, Martinez- 
Loriente et al., 2016) and displacing the seafloor (Terrinha et al., 2009; Duarte, 
2011; Rosas et al., 2012, in appendix VI and Duarte et al., 2013). To the NE, 
the fault scarp has a maximum height of 1000m decreasing gradually towards 
the SW, the interference zone with the SWIM fault. In this particular area, new 
faults were identified referred as corner structures. These faults have a 
dominant oblique movement, mainly dextral transcurrent movement (Figure I.9, 
Rosas et al, 2012, in appendix VI). 

The São Vicente Fault (SVF) strikes ?NE-SW steeply dipping to the SE flanking 
the São Vicente Canyon (Figure I.6) with a reverse kinematic component. 
Pereira and Alves (2013) depict in detail the offshore extension of the 
Messejana-Plasencia Fault Zone (MPFZ, see Figure I.1), which comprehends 
the SVF. The onshore part of this fault is more than 500km long, cuts across 
Paleozoic folds and contains a tholeiitic basic dyke of ~200 Ma of age that can 
exceed 80m in width; these features attest for the deep origin of this fault, 
possibly cutting across the Moho. 

The Gorringe Bank (GB) is a 5 km high seamount with a 9 m positive geoid 
anomaly and an elastic lithosphere thickness of 35km (Hayward et al., 1999, 
Jiménez-Munt et al., 2010 and references within). Girardeau et al. (1998) 
considered that the Gorringe Bank comprises a lithosphere composition mainly 
composed of serpentinized peridotites locally with a sheet-like gabbro intrusion, 
rare tholeiitic dikes and pillow-lavas. The present day structure, according to 
Jiménez-Munt et al. (2010), is controlled by a major NW verging, sub-crustal 
thrust fault - the Gorringe Fault (GorF in Figure I.1 and Figure I.6) with a ramp 
and flat geometry with at least 20 km shortening in 5-10 Ma (Late-middle

Miocene). Tectonic and seismic activities are testified by major mass wasting 
processes. Lo Iacono et al. (2012) and Valadares (2012) identified several 
slumps, slide scarps and mass movements in the Gorringe bank flanks. 

The Horseshoe Abyssal plain Thrust (HAT-Figure I.8) was defined by Martinez-
Loriente et al., (2013). It is a NE-SW trending, NW-verging tectonic structure 
that establishes the boundary between domains of Cretaceous exhumed 
serpentinized mantle and Jurassic oceanic crust (Figure I.1). More recently 
Martinez-Loriente et al., (2016) refined the NE-SW to a NNE-SSW trend, which 
eventually may link to the MPF. 

 
Figure I.8- Regional synthetic lithospheric cross-section from Martinez-Loriente et al., (2016) 
illustrating the HAT and HF in depth. 

The SWIM faults 

The SWIM Faults (SWIM stands for South West Iberia Margin) (Figure I.9) were 
firstly identified as WNW-ESE trending lineaments in MATESPRO swath 
bathymetry compilation (Terrinha et al, 2009 and Rosas et al., 2009) and later 
defined as vertical faults with the same trend in Zitellini et al., (2009). These 
faults host mud volcanoes and correspond to deep rooted dextral strike-slip 
faults, cutting through the Mesozoic basement, upper-Miocene sediments up to 
the sea floor present day sediments (Zitellini et al., 2009 and Rosas et al., 
2009). In the basement these structures are, at least locally, related with pre-
existent rift Mesozoic faults (Terrinha et al., 2009 and Duarte et al., 2011, in 
appendix VII). In both NEAREST refraction profiles P1 and P2, these structures 
are shown to extended into the oceanic crust (and possible into the upper 
mantle, Martínez-Loriente et al., 2013 and Sallarès et al., 2011). The SWIM 
faults bathymetric expression is clear to the East, to the north of the Coral Path 
Ridge, but become less prominent in the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain.  

Neotectonic numerical modelling indicates that the SWIM faults should be 
regarded as discontinuous features (Cunha et al., 2012.) and not as mature 
lithospheric-scale features marking the present day plate boundary between 
Nubia and Eurasia as suggested by Zitellini et al. (2009).  

According to analogue modelling in Duarte et al. (2011, in appendix VII) the 
intersection pattern of the SWIM faults with the Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary 
Wedge indicates that both tectonic structures are active in the Present.

I.3. Seismicity  

I.3.1.Historical seismicity  

The seismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz region is distributed, with events of low to 
intermediate magnitude, occasionally disturbed by strong earthquakes. An 
example is the 1st November 1755 earthquake (Figure I.10 and Figure I.11) 
which had estimated magnitude of 8.75 (Richter, 1958 and Johnston, 1996) or 
M=8.5 (Solares and Arroyo, 2004). This earthquake will be discussed with more 
detail in section I.3.1. 

According to Carrilho et al. (2010) the historical period is considered until 1960. 
From that year on it was installed the World-Wide Standardized Seismograph 
Network. Within the historical seismicity few events are known until the 
medieval age as we can see in Figure I.10.  

The 63 B.C. earthquake is the first known historical event in the area of the Gulf 
of Cadiz (Figure I.10 and Figure I.11). It affected mostly the Portugal and Galiza 
coasts and the estimated magnitude is 8.5 (Martins and Mendes Victor, 2001). 
An associated tsunami may have forced the population to escape from near 
coastal villages (Carrilho et al., 2010 and references therein). The 382 A.D 
earthquake with M?7.0 (Martins and Mendes Victor, 2001) caused a large

destructive tsunami that is associated with the disappearing of an existing island 
(Baptista et al, 2007 and references therein). In 24th of August 1356, a large 
earthquake located in the Horseshoe Abyssal plain (M?7.5, idem), was felt in all 
Iberian Peninsula. Reports of the damages are similar to the 1755 event; 
however no tsunami evidences were described (Carrilho et al., 2010).  

In the 18th century, besides the 1755 earthquake, two other large earthquakes 
occurred in the area of the Algarve. The 6th of March 1719 earthquake was 
located in the area of Portimão. The estimated magnitude was 7.0 or lower 
according to Carrilho et al. (2010) and references therein, but the reported 
damages are restricted to Portimão and local villages. Also in Algarve, an 
earthquake struck Tavira on 27th December 1722. It was felt from the São 
Vicente cape to Spanish borders. It had a tsunami associated that flooded 
Tavira but had no significant effects in the other towns on the shore of Algarve. 
Baptista et al. (2007) based on numerical tsunami modelling and multichannel 
seismic profiles interpretation, estimated a magnitude ?6.5 and the epicentre in 
the nearby submarine area, to the SSE of Tavira associated with NNE-SSW 
inverted thrust system, verging to WNW.

I.3.1.1.The 1st November 1755 earthquake and tsunami  

The 1st November 1755 earthquake and tsunami was extensively studied over 
the years. There are several historical documents describing this event that was 
felt from Finland to the Azores and Cape Verde Islands. With estimated 
magnitudes ranging from 8.5 to 8.8, it is one of the most destructive 
earthquakes in the History of Europe. The tsunami invaded Lisbon downtown 
roughly 250m and 10-15m waves were reported in São Vicente Cape. Its 
effects were described in Madeira, Cadiz and Cornwall, with water agitation 
expressed in Scotland and Switzerland (Baptista and Miranda, 2009). Still, the 
tectonic source and mechanism of this event is a matter of discussion (see 
Figure I.12).  

An estimation of the source characteristics were drawn by various authors in 
comparison with earthquakes from the instrumental record and/or based on 
event description and tsunami evidences. Johnston et al. (1996) suggested that 
the seismic source (based on isoseismal area, see Figure I.12) should have a 
fault length 180-200km, width 80 km and an average displacement of 10-14m. 
Accordingly, these authors proposed the northwestwards directed Gorringe fault 
(Figure I.1) as the possible seismogenic structure for this event. Gardin et al. 
(2007) based on simulation of ground motions also agree that the Gorringe 
bank should be the source area of this event. However, numerical models on 
tsunami propagation show incompatibility with this solution (Baptista et al, 
1998).

Figure I.12-The isoseismal lines for the 1755 earthquake and some of suggested source 
mechanism: Marquês de Pombal Thrust, Gorringe faults and east dipping subduction zone 
below Gibraltar arc. Also the location and focal mechanism of the 28th February 1969 
earthquake (are from Gutscher et al, 2006).  

The Marquês de Pombal Thrust fault -Back-Thrust system was also proposed 
by Zitellini et al (2001).The authors associated this system to the seismicity 
observed below the São Vicente Canyon. These events would mimic the 
rupture area of the 1755 Lisbon Earthquake (Figure I.7. and Figure I.12) 

Ribeiro et al. (2006) discuss the different source solutions proposed for this 
event. Besides the limitations referred to the Gorringe Bank Fault solution, 
these authors point out that the MPF-BTF system does not fulfil rupture area 
requirements. It is described other possibilities adding complement source 
areas to this system: a) Horseshoe Fault (HsF); b) Pereira de Sousa- Principe 
de Avis Fault system; c) Guadalquivir bank Fault (also in Baptista et al., 2003). 
The authors favour the HsF-MPT solution based on the similar orientation and 
almost geometric continuity between both fault zones, which facilitate 
strain/displacement transfer between them. Other complex sources are 
described by Vilanova et al., (2004) including the Lower Tagus Valley (LTV) 
fault near Lisbon. This fault is located in the Tagus River valley and would 
explain the strong motion in Lisbon. According to these authors the isoseismic 
pattern in Lisbon cannot be explained by an offshore source alone, arguing that 
the main offshore shock triggered an onshore rupture in the LTV fault. 

Gutscher et al. (2002, 2004 and 2006) and Thiebot and Gutscher (2006) 
proposed that the seismogenic source is related with an east-dipping active 
subduction zone imaged on seismic tomography, below the Gibraltar Arc, also 
related with deep seismicity in Granada region. Gutscher et al. (2006) also 
suggested that besides the subduction zone that would explain the seismic 
moment associated with this event, an additional source located to the NW (in 



Strain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate 
boundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia

the area of the Gorringe or northern Gulf of Cadiz) is needed to account for the 
tsunami descriptions.  

Stich et al. (2007) scaled the source parameters of the 12th February 2007 to 
the 1755 event, suggesting a fault length of 230 to 315 km and an average slip 
of 8.5 to 11.7m, for a seismic moment between 7 × 10  and 14 × 10  
for Mw= 8.5 and 8.7, respectively. The authors suggest that an active 
subduction is not mandatory to generate the 1755 earthquake and agree in a 
composite multi-fault rupture including the Horseshoe fault and any other fault 
(eg. Marquês de Pombal or São Vicente faults). 

Matias et al. (2013) proposed an improved method to define fault models for 
tsunamigenic events in the Gulf of Cadiz. The authors point out that a Mw 8.5-
8.75 earthquake, with a seismic moment of 7.16 × 10  to 1.70 × 10 , 
the rupture length would be of 143 to 220 km, the width from 119 to 120 km and 
an average displacement of 6.44 and 9.90m, respectively. This is true for a 
source area in the Gulf of Cadiz but outside the accretionary wedge. Within the 
accretionary wedge the source dimensions are complex based on the 
parameters identified in subduction zones elsewhere. Accordingly the seismic 
source would vary between a length of 282-315 km, a width 79-105 km and an 
average displacement ranging from 7.8-10 m, for Mw 8.5 to 8.75, respectively. 
The source parameters in the accretionary wedge area are roughly in 
agreement with Sitch et al. (2007) calculations. 

More recently, Zitellini et al. (2009) suggested an alternative source solution 
combining a 600km long active fault zone WNW-ESE dextral strike-slip with the 
Horseshoe fault. This solution would comprise a total rupture area of more than 
400km, compatible with the expected parameters to the 1755 event.  

I.3.2.Instrumental seismicity  

In the instrumental record, the Gulf of Cadiz is the source area of the Ms?8.0 
28th February 1969 earthquake (Figure I.13). The hypocenter was located 
between 22-33 km depth (López-Arroyo &amp;amp; Udias, 1972 and Fukao, 1973) and 
the focal mechanism solutions point-out to a thrust with small strike-slip 
movement, striking NE-SW, parallel to the Gorringe fault and dipping either NW 
(Fukao, 1973) or SE (López-Arroyo &amp;amp; Udias, 1972). The aftershock sequence 
had one Mb?5.5 event with similar fault plane solution but located 50 ± 5 km 
deep (Grimison et al., 1986) or 29 km (Buforn et al., 2004), in the upper mantle.  

To the east is the location of the 12 February 2007, with Mw ? 6.0 and 
hypocenter at 40 km beneath the seafloor. The moment tensor inversion 
showed a thrust with small strike-slip movement. The preferred fault plane is 
discussed both in Stich et al. (2007) and Custódio at al. (2011) with 
contradicting results. Stich et al. (2007) indicate a NE-SW solution parallel to 
the Horseshoe Fault but located in the footwall of this fault and dipping in the 
opposite direction. However, Custódio et al. (2011) refer to a WNW -ESE

solution, dipping 46º SW. For all the above cases seismic activity diverges from 
the known active faults in the Gulf of Cadiz region. This event was also studied 
by Buforn et al, (2007) and selected the same preferred fault plane as Stich et 
al. (2007). Buforn et a. (2007) estimated Mw=5.9, a rupture area ?160km2, with 
14 and 12.5 km in length and width, respectively. The maximum displacement is 
of 0.63m. Much smaller is Stich et al. (2007) calculated dimension: an average 
area of 54km2, with fault length 8.2 and width 6.5km.  

Other important events are the 29th July 2003 with Mw=5.3 at 40 km depth, in 
the same area of the 12 February 2007 event. Pro et al. (2012) calculated the 
source parameters: an area of 50 km2 and an average displacement of 0.08m. 
The focal mechanism is also similar to the 12 February 2007 earthquake.  
Finally, more recently is the 2009, 17th December earthquake with Mw=5.5, with 
a rupture area of 113km2 and an average slip of 0.08. The moment tensor 
corresponds to a dip-slip solution with a nearly NNE-SSW sub-vertical solution 
or a sub-horizontal plane NNW-SSE. The event was located in the São Vicente 
canyon, at a depth of 36 km (Pro et al., 2012).   

 
Figure I.13- Instrumental seismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz area (circles define low to intermediate 
magnitude earthquakes, 2000-2015, recorded by Instituto Português do Mar e da Atmosfera 
permanent seismic network, stars define the location of the highest instrumental events 
recorded in this area, from Borges et al., 2001 references within, Stich et al, 2010 and Custódio 
et al., 2016). 

The seismic energy release during historical and instrumental periods (until 
2003) is presented in Carrilho (2005). The author compiled the information from 
four different catalogues restricted to M?4 earthquakes. We show just three in 
Figure I.14: In Figure I.14A is shown a catalogue from the beginning of the

seismic network, in the early 60’s to middle 80’s (sec XX). It is clear that 
released energy pattern in our study area is completely disturbed and 
dominated by M=8, 28th February 1969 earthquake. During the period shown in 
Figure I.14B no high magnitude earthquakes were recorded. In this case, we 
can observe a different pattern defined by the released seismic energy in the 
Gulf of Cadiz. NW-SE alignments, sub-parallel to SH-max and a roughly NE-
SW pattern coincident with the Gorringe Bank. Both features are coincident with 
dense seismic activity in Figure I.13. In Figure I.14C, all events are included 
since the first historical earthquake until 2003. The pattern is completely 
saturated by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.  

The patterns observed in Figure I.14 are somehow biased because they result 
from monitoring off-shore seismic activity (in the Gulf of Cadiz) based on an on-
shore land permanent network. Carrilho (2005) presents an important study on 
the seismicity in the Southwest Portugal Mainland. In his final remarks refers 
that limitation on events locations resulting from land-network geographical 
distribution can be overcome by ocean bottom stations network in Gulf of Cadiz.  

Preliminary results from NEAREST OBS experiment were presented in Geissler 
et al. (2010). The study is centred in a catalogue with 36 earthquakes (ML 2.2 to 
4.8). These events are concentrated at 40–60 km depth, near the base of the 
seismogenic layer and roughly align along two perpendicular directions, NNE-
SSW and WNW-ESE striking structures. Each direction defines a hypocenters 
cluster, along the São Vicente canyon and the Horseshoe abyssal plain, 
respectively. The study points out the necessity to evaluate seismic activity by 
means of OBS networks, since detailed information can be gained on 
hypocenter locations and fault kinematics (Geissler et al., 2010).  

Custódio et al, (2015, 2016) also reported the existence of hypocentres 
clustering in the Gulf of Cadiz, in the Gorringe Bank, the Horseshoe abyssal 
plain, the São Vicente Canyon and in the Guadalquivir Bank. According to these 
authors, offshore seismicity shows intriguing features that can be better 
explored with more accurate depth estimates as well as better estimates of 
absolute epicentral locations. These would promote a more adequate dataset to 
envision the relation between offshore clusters and seismo-tectonic structures. 

More recently Grevemeyer et al. (2016) reported the results of a temporary 
OBS network deployment in the area of the Portimão bank and the accretionary 
wedge. The experiment was 6 months long and resulted in a dataset with 86 
events located in ?6 stations. Most seismicity was located in the Portimão bank 
with depth between 15 and 40 km. If compared with Sallarès et al. (2011) P2-
NEAREST refraction profile, these depth ranges correspond to lower 
continental crust or uppermost mantle. The existence of seismicity at these 
domains is rare. According to Grevemeyer et al. (2016), it might be caused by 
the specific geological setting, where deformation occurs in cool lithosphere of 
Mesozoic age, resulting in a strong lower crust and upper continental mantle.

I.3.3.Fault rupture parameters for Mw?4 events in the Gulf of Cadiz  

Wells and Coppersmith (1994) is a classic work that uses empirical formulations 
that compare seismic events with fault rupture areas. However, this paper is 
based on a global dataset that included exclusively shallow-focus continental 
interplate or intraplate earthquakes of magnitudes greater than approximately 
4.5 which are not comparable with the Gulf of Cadiz geodynamic setting. 
Instead, Matias et al., 2013 formulation was specifically conceived for the Gulf 
of Cadiz area, although for large magnitude events. 

The relation between fault dimensional parameters and the seismic event is 
established by the seismic moment definition:  

=  

Where µ is the shear modulus, A is the fault rupture area (L*W) and u is the 
average slip along the fault. We can access the Mo from the moment magnitude 
Mw using the following relation: 

= log Mo
1.5

?  6.07, 

 with Mo in Nm (based on IASPEI recommendation). 

So, for a given Mw we can calculate the seismic moment. Since we are working 
with NEAREST catalogue, we only have access to local magnitude estimations. 
There is no clear relation between this magnitude estimation and seismic 
moment. We will use the moment magnitude estimations for 3 common events 
reported in Stich et al. (2010). Also, we deduced the fault parameters for the 
larger earthquakes in the Gulf of Cadiz and the area linking to the Gloria fault 
system. For events rupturing in the crust we assumed a µ = 4.0 × 10  Pa, for 
crust and mantle rupture µ = 6.5 × 10  Pa and finally within the mantle 
µ = 7.0 × 10  Pa (based on Matias et al, 2013 and references within). We 
assume based on the available refraction data that the Moho depth is between 
10km and 15km. To estimate fault rupture we used the following definitions 
based on Matias et al., 2013:

I.4. Earthquakes dynamics and seismogenic limits 

Faults move at different speeds, ranging from m/s during an earthquake to 
cm/year at tectonic plate rates. Accordingly, slip is accommodated by slow-slip 
creep, slow-slip seismic event and stick-slip. It is unclear how the transition 
between these slip mechanisms occurs (Peng and Gomberg, 2010). 
Nevertheless, it seems that slip is largely dependent on specific characteristics 
of fault zones, such as frictional proprieties (e,g Sholz, 1998, Rice and Cocco, 
2005, Peng and Gomberg, 2010).   

It appears that frictional stability in fault zones is a key element on earthquakes 
generation, since earthquakes will occur mostly in pre-existing fault zones or 
anisotropy planes and rarely at newly formed fault planes. Brace and Byerlee 
(1966) defined that the earthquake cycle results from a stick-slip frictional 
instability. The earthquake is the slip event and the stick period would explain 
interseismic elastic strain accumulation interval. The transition from one stage 
to another depends on the nature of friction in the faults.  

Scholz (1998) explained that seismogenesis is determined by frictional stability 
and restricted to areas of unstable friction. This parameter was studied for 
different rocks through experimental tests, resulting in several friction laws. The 
following example is the one that best explains observation and it was given by 
the Dieterich-Ruina law (in Sholz, 1998). 

I.4.1.Friction stability laws, aseismic and seismic slip  

The rate and the state of friction law is given by 

= ( ? )[µ + ( ? ) ln( / )] 

Where  is the steady–state frictional strength and dependent on the slip rate, 
, effective normal stress ( ? ), where  is normal stress and  is the pore 

fluid pressure in the fault. The initial friction coefficient is given by µ  and the 
initial steady-state velocity is defined by ,  defines the direct frictional 
response to the increase of slip velocity increase while  describes the frictional 
response in reverse transition (fast to slow, see Figure I.15). For ( ? ) &gt; 0, 
the fault segment has velocity-strengthening behaviour, so remains stable 
(creep) at seismic slip velocities. While for ( ? ) &amp;lt;0, the fault segment has 
velocity-weakening behaviour which results in unstable and potentially 
seismogenic area. This parameter is primarily dependent on material 
proprieties, resulting that some lithologies would favour velocity weakening 
behaviour while others would have a velocity strengthening behaviour; seismic 
and aseismic, respectively. 

The temperature has an essential control on the ( ? ) parameter. At low 
temperatures ( ? ) can be negative and progressively become positive with 
the increase of temperature. This transition is dependent in the mineral content

of the fault zone. For granite, as is exemplified in Sholz (1998), the temperature 
transition is 300ºC, coincident the onset of crystal plasticity of quartz. The depth 
in which this transition occurs depends on the local temperature gradient. 
According to the same author, this would explain the depth limit of earthquakes 
in the continental crust.  

 
Figure I.15- A schematic representation of frictional (µ) response to variation on the velocity of 
displacement in a rock experimental test. Note that a defines the frictional response to slip rate 
increase while b describes an evolutionary response with velocity decrease. The difference 
between a-b defines the material response to changes in slip rate (for more details see 
text).Steady-state weakening.  

I.4.2.Dynamic weakening of the fault zone and the transition between 
aseismic and seismic slip behavior  

The transition between aseismic stable creep and unstable stick-slip behavior is 
not well understood and often assumed to be separated in space and to occur 
on two different types of fault segment (Noda and Lapusta, 2013).  

These authors proposed a numerical model of a planar fault zone with 
heterogeneous rheology. In the model stable, creeping segments of a fault 
become unstable due to dynamic weakening. The rheological proprieties of the 
model was based on the laboratory measurements in samples from Mw 7.6 
1999 Chi-Chi earthquake.  

In detail the model included two patches. Patch A with small dynamic 
weakening, ( ? ) &amp;lt;0, tending to seismic slip and Patch B, with ( ? ) &gt; 0, 
prone to creeping, with lower permeability and therefore more susceptible co-
seismic weakening due to thermal pressurization of pore fluids. The two 
patches were surrounding by steady area, moving at the representative plate 
rate. The model results show frequent earthquakes activity in patch A. Only 
large earthquakes reach Patch B. In this last case, slip is larger in patch B. 
During the experiments, Patch B showed complex rheological behaviour: 
creeping at tectonic strain rates, seismic slip contaminated by large events 
originated from Patch A, and locked.  

Complex rupture patterns were also observed resulting from the interaction 
between the two patches. In a simulation of the Tohoku-Oki earthquake (Mw=9)

the slip was firstly propagated mostly to the Patch A. Next, thermal 
pressurization of Patch B promoted large local slip. This rupture increased 
stress concentration in Patch A causing re-rupture of the area.  

The authors conclude that fluids can cause stable fault segments to accumulate 
great amounts of slip, due to thermal fluid pressurization during high slip rates. 
Understanding the possible contribution of aseismic slip segments during co-
seismic slip is fundamental to evaluate seismic hazard of not only of subduction 
zones but also of large strike-slip faults. 

I.4.2.1.Serpentinization as a weakening mechanism 

Serpentinization is present at several geodynamic settings where water 
interacts with ultramafic rocks. Accordingly, it is common during continental 
extension in slow spreading centres; oceanic rifts and transform faults; in 
lithospheric scale strike-slip faults and in subduction zones. Serpentinites have 
a distinctive rheological behaviour that results in an effective control on tectonic 
processes. The role of serpentinization on strain localization, seismic slip and 
creep control at fault zones and of dehydration reaction on seismicity 
distribution in subduction zones has been broadly studied both by experimental 
and nature observations (Guillot et al., 2015). 

One key finding is that slightly serpentinized rocks have the rheology of pure 
serpentinites. Based on mechanical data, Escartin et al. (2001) demonstrate 
that even for serpentine contents as low as 10 %, deformation is mostly 
accommodated along serpentinite bearing grain boundaries while olivine 
remains intact. Experiments demonstrated that serpentinization in fault zones, 
even if in lower percentage, will weaken and promote strain localization.  

Amiguet et al. (2013) studied the deformation mechanism and rheology of 
serpentinites (lizardite and antigorite) in experiments and nature. Lizardite is 
described as one of the most common serpentinite minerals at low 
temperatures. It is stable at temperatures&amp;lt;320°C and at pressures&amp;lt;0.7 GPa 
above these values starts the transition to antigorite. At natural strain rates 
Lizardite shows brittle behavior and move towards a transition state at relative 
shallow depths and a shear stress &gt; 100 MPa. Down to the deeper part of the 
crustal faults, lizardite is ductile by plastic flow: glide and/or dissolution 
precipitation. Also, lizardite has frictional proprieties with coefficient of internal 
friction (µF) ?0.35, below most rocks (0.5&amp;lt;µF &amp;lt;0.8) resulting in lower frictional 
strength than expected based on Beyerlee law. Subsequently, the presence of 
lizardite in oceanic transform faults could explain the weakness of these faults. 
Antigorite is the high temperature serpentine mineral. Ductile behavior starts at 
roughly 30km in depth and a pressure of 1GPa, extending down to ?90km deep 
(or at &gt;700°C) where dehydration starts.  

Another shallow depth serpentinite species is chrysotile. This mineral is less 
common than lizardite, but it is more stable at high water/rock ratios. Moore and 



I. Introduction 

25 
 

Lockner (2004) evaluated experimentally the variation of this mineral µF with 
effective normal stress and temperature variation. At temperatures below 100ºC 
and low stress (&lt;50 MPa), µF=0.1; at high normal stress and temperature 
(?281ºC and 200MPa) the frictional strength or µF is maximum ?0.55. It is 
worthwhile noticing that at temperatures below 100ºC, chrysotile shows velocity 
strengthening at all strain-rates, and velocity weakening, in all experiments, at 
281ºC. At intermediate temperatures, the authors reported a combination of the 
two behaviours. This pattern is in agreement with the seismic and creep 
observation in large strike-slip faults such as Hayward Fault, aseismic at 
shallow depth but probably locked bellow 5km depth, nevertheless associated 
with large earthquakes (Moore and Lockner, 2004). 

High velocity friction experiments disclose dynamic weakening of serpentinite at 
seismic slip rates. According to Kohli et al. (2011) serpentinite displays velocity-
strengthening behaviour at plate tectonic slip rates but dynamic weakening at 
seismic slip velocities. The experiments indicate that only a few millimeters of 
slip may be required at near-seismic velocities to achieve a weakened frictional 
state. Permanent frictional weakening may be related with Antigorite 
dehydration into talc, olivine and water (Kohli et al, 2011). Co-seismic 
dehydration of serpentinite, during large earthquakes, would lead to thermal 
pressurization and consequent weakening of the fault zone (Lin et al, 2013).     

I.4.3.The depth limit of the seismogenic zone 

The strength of the lithosphere is a function of composition, crustal thickness, 
and geotherm (Ranalli and Murphy, 1987). Accordingly, these variables will also 
control the depth limit of the seismogenic zone. 

The rheological model of the oceanic lithosphere is defined by a strong brittle 
upper cover overlying a soft ductile layer (e.g. Mckenzie et al., 2005). The brittle 
strength will increase as pressure increases with depth and ductile strength will 
decrease drastically as temperature increases. The brittle-ductile transition 
(BDT) matches with the 600ºC isotherm and defines the depth limit of the 
earthquakes. It is also noteworthy that the 600ºC isotherm coincides with the 
transition between the velocity weakening to velocity strengthening of the olivine 
(Boettcher et al., 2007). 

In the continental lithosphere rheology is more complex. According to some 
authors the seismogenesis is almost restricted to the crustal layer and there are 
little evidences for upper mantle earthquakes (Maggi et al., 2000). If restricted to 
the upper crustal levels, then quartz is generally the phase controlling the bulk 
rheology of the upper continental crust (e.g Afonso and Ranalli, 2004, 
references therein). Earthquakes in the mantle are rare and also limited to the 
temperatures below the 600ºC.  

At continental margins, in the continent –ocean transition zone, lithospheric 
rheology reflects a compositional transition between oceanic and continental

domains. Accordingly, seismicity may be found at depths below from what is 
expected at continental domains but above or at the limit of the adjacent 
oceanic domain (Craig et al, 2011).

II.Data and methods 

In this chapter, it is first described the acquisition of the seismological data and 
of the multichannel seismic reflection profiles used in this study. A short review 
of the most recent refraction and bathymetric data available is also provided. 
The methods used for processing (and interpretation) of the data are then 
presented, along with a summary of the fundamental background theory. The 
application details are developed in chapters III and IV dedicated to the 
seismological and geological interpretations, respectively.  

II.1. Seismic network and instrument characterization  

As part of the NEAREST project, 24 ocean bottom seismometers (OBSs) and 
the multi-parametric station GEOSTAR were deployed at the seafloor across 
the Gulf of Cadiz for the acquisition of passive seismicity data. The German 
DEPAS OBS instrument pool deployment was coordinated by the Alfred 
Wegener Institute (AWI) for Polar and Marine Research, and the experiment 
took place from August 2007 to August 2008. The network distribution is shown 
in Figure II.1, including land stations (from IPMA- Instituto Português do Mar e 
da Atmosfera and Instituto Dom Luiz-IDL) used in this work (Figure II.1).

II.1.1.LOBSTER network 

The OBS specifically referred to as LOBSTER (Longterm Ocean Bottom 
Seismometer for Tsunami and Earthquake Research) were manufactured by 
K.U.M. Umwelt- und Meerestechnik Kiel GmbH, Germany. The deployment and 
recovery was coordinated by Wolfram Geissler from AWI.  

All instruments were equipped with a Güralp CMG-40T broadband 
seismometer, incorporated in titanium pressure housing, a HTI-04-PCA/ULF 
hydrophone and a GEOLON MCS (Marine Compact Seismocorder) data logger 
from SEND GmbH Hamburg, Germany. The power supply both for seismometer 
and recorder was provided by 132 lithium power cells.  

Each sensor channel was sampled at 100 Hz; preamplifier gain of the 
hydrophone channel was 4 and 1 for the three seismometer components 
(Figure II.2 and Table II.1). The total disk space of the stations was 20 GB 
covering a recording time of 11 to 12 months, depending on the seismic activity 
in the area. The clocks of the data loggers were synchronized by GPS time 
before deployment and synchronized again after recovery of the instruments 
using a SENDCOM-3 interface. The time difference was corrected linearly. The 
seismometers also incorporated a cardanic levelling mechanism, which started 
few hours after the OBS reached the seafloor and re-levelled every 15 days.

II.1.1.1.OBS calibration information  

The metadata information was processed and gathered in dataless seed files by 
Carlos Corela (Technical report on behalf of NEAREST project). The dataless 
seed files were created using the PDCC software from IRIS. They contain all 
the standard information e.g. names of station, coordinates, network identifier or 
the start/end of acquisition and calibration information.  

II.1.1.2.OBS quality check and pre-processing considerations 

The quality control of the acquisition was done using the software SEISMIC 
HANDLER (http://www.seismic-handler.org) and SEISAN (Havskov &amp;amp; 
Ottemöller, 2011). Some problems were detected and reported: levelling, 
power, time correction and OBS orientation (from NEAREST Deliverable 9 
report, 2009). In the table II.2 is a resume of the parameters check on-board. 

The OBS 07 information is blank because this station was deployed for a test 
measurement (comparison with GEOSTAR) and recovered successfully during 
the 2007 deployment campaign. OBSs 24 and 25 were only deployed at 
November 27th, 2007 during another cruise with the fisher boat “Mario Luis” 
from Portimão (from NEAREST Deliverable 9 report, 2009).  

The levelling problems 

The seismometers incorporated a levelling system which was forced to start few 
hours after the deployment and was repeated every 15 days. Nine out of the 
twenty four OBS levelled correctly from the operation start, 2 started to level 
after one month (plus one after 6 months) and the 12 others did not level, at 
least one component (normally the X component), during the acquisition time 
(details in Table II.2).

The power, memory use and time correction problems 

At the time of recovery, 21 out of the 24 stations had already stopped recording 
because of lack of memory (“diskfull”) and/or of power (“battery low”) (details in 
Table II.2). These may be explained by the long duration of the acquisition 
period at a high sampling rate. The recording process stopped properly for the 
11 stations with full disks, allowing time synchronization (Table II.3). The 
“battery low” message at 10 stations was unexpected, because the capacity of 
the 132 Li cells should have covered 12 month recording. The power lost was 
too severe (with only one exception- OBS11) stopping the recorders’ internal 
clocks which unabled time synchronization. 

 
Table II.3- Time drifts/year resulting from skew times measured onboard.  

 

Another problem rose from the actual skew times measured onboard which 
revealed time drifts/year superior to the maximum expected drift of 1.46 
seconds per year (for 8 out of 15 stations with synchronized time, see 30s-50 
Hz). Three methods were used to estimate clock drifts for unsynchronized 
stations and to reproduce the skew times measured onboard: noise correlation 
functions, P-wave residuals and P-wave residuals double differences. The 
results from all methods showed coherency between them, with linear 
correlation ranging from 0.7 to 0.9 but none successfully reproduced time drifts 
higher than 1.5 seconds per year. Additional information from previous 
campaigns and also provided by Klaus Schleisiek from SEND pointed out that 
the skew times measured onboard may have an error of integer values. 

P-wave arrivals residuals from the land stations and the P-wave residuals 
double difference were used as absolute time references to established final 
time corrections to onboard measured skew times and unsynchronized station.

Table II.4- Proposed set of clock drift and skew times applied to NEAREST AWI OBS. 

 

OBS orientation problems 

The orientation of the OBS on the seafloor is unknown and so the LOBSTER 
system was equipped with an electronic compass. However, the magnetic field 
around this equipment was dominated by the anchor system which conditioned 
any possible measurements. So, OBS orientations were estimated using P-
phase polarization in teleseismic events (from NEAREST Deliverable 9, 2009). 
Corela (2014) also recovered OBS orientation using surface wave polarization 
in teleseismic events. He applied two different methods: Grigoli method and the 
Stachnik method (details on the procedure in Corela, 2014 and on the methods 
in Grigoli et al., 2011 as well as in Stachnik et al., 2012) 

II.1.2.GEOSTAR 

The GEOSTAR is a multidisciplinary observatory which comprises a set of 
geophysical and oceanographic sensors for continuous data acquisition. The 
GEOSTAR project is coordinated by the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e 
Vulcanologia –INGV. The GEOSTAR bottom station (Figure II.3B and Table 
II.5) is equipped with a GEOSTAR Guralp CMG-40T seismometer 30s-50 Hz 
(OBS), Guralp CMG-5T accelerometer DC-100Hz (ACC), OAS hydrophone DC-
50 Hz (HYD), all with a sample rate of 100 Hz and a DM24 GURALP digitizer 
(24 bit) (from NEAREST Deliverable 9 report). Time synchronization is 
performed between a SERCEL rubidium clock and the GPS DM-24 channel. 

Accurate and safe positioning at seafloor, re-entry and recovery capabilities of a 
Bottom Station are ensured by the dedicated cable suspended mobile docker –
MODUS (Figure II.3A). The MODUS is an auxiliary module to deploy and

II.1.2.1.GEOSTAR quality check and pre-processing considerations 

Data quality check was performed using SAC software and included time and 
frequency domains. Three types of data disturbances were reported (From 
NEAREST Deliverable 9 report in http://nearest.bo.ismar.cnr.it/): 

? A high amplitude disturbance (D1- Figure II.4) affecting all frequencies 
identified in all components both in geophone and accelerometer 
records. It was transversal to all acquisition periods with a recurrence 
time of 145s, lasting for 50s, and caused by anomalous re-levelling 
process; 

? A high frequency disturbance (D2- Figure II.4) with 1Hz and affecting 
frequencies between 4-12 Hz; 

? A loss of data disturbance resulting from periodical rebooting of the 
Seismometer Data- handling Unit (SDU).

The GEOSTAR group developed methods to correct disturbance D1 and D2 
and results are displayed in Figure II.4. (from NEAREST Deliverable 9 report, 
2009). However, in our study we used the uncorrected record. 

 
Figure II.4- Signal corrections for disturbances D1 and D2 (in red original signal and in blue 
corrected signal From NEAREST Deliverable 9 report in http://nearest.bo.ismar.cnr.it/). 

Time corrections problem 

The GEOSTAR data was distributed with a time-correction applied, having a 
total drift of 184 ms after 359 days. However during tests to solve the LOBSTER 
network synchronization problem, a 2s jump of the GEOSTAR clock close to the 
end of the deployment period was detected. To solve this unexpected 
observation GEOSTAR was corrected using clock drift estimated by the P-wave 
residuals double differences (as unsynchronized OBSs). A drift time correction 
of 1.925 in s/year and a skew time of 1.925 were therefore suggested 
(assuming that the acquisition time lasted exactly one year, information from 
Luis Matias, Technical report on behalf of NEAREST project). 

II.1.3.Permanent Land network 

The land stations are distributed in a seismic network coordinated by the 
Instituto Português do Mar e da Atmosfera (IPMA). The national seismic 
stations are owned by several institutions (see details on the land network in 
https://www.ipma.pt/pt/geofisica/). 

During the acquisition period 275 earthquakes were detected by the land 
network within the deployment area (Figure II.5).The data recorded in this

network during the acquisition period was used as a preliminary reference for 
the earthquake events detected by NEAREST stations. Additionally, we used 
the data recorded in a selected group of stations (closer to the study area) to 
complement focal mechanism solutions. A description and localization of these 
stations are given in Table II.6 and Figure II.5.

II.2. Bathymetry 

The bathymetric map shown in Figure II.6 was used as the base for the 
seismotectonic interpretation of the passive seismic data resulting from 
NEAREST OBS experiment. This map was produced from a compilation of the 
high-resolution multibeam swath bathymetry data acquired in the Gulf of Cadiz. 
These data were processed by the ESF EuroMargins SWIM project 
“Earthquake and Tsunami hazards of active faults at the South West Iberian 
Margin: deep structure, high-resolution imaging and paleoseismic signature”. 
The data were acquired during 19 surveys (Table II.7) totalling over 200 days of 
ship time, all performed between 1978 and 2006 by teams belonging to 14 
research institutions from 7 European countries (Zitellini et al., 2009). The 
SWIM compilation comprises a mapping area of 180000 km2, with a depth 
range from 30 to 5200 m and a 100 m cell size overall grid for the Gulf of Cadiz 
(Valadares, 2012).

II.3. Multichannel seismic reflection and refraction profiles 

The multichannel seismic profiles (MCS) studied in this work were selected from 
Academia surveys (Figure II.7). Our analysis of the MCS was specifically 
focused on the interpretation of passive seismicity results. Two main objectives 
were considered:  

? Delimitate seismic units to support the interpretation of the velocity and 
stations correction derived during events location procedures (all 
available dataset, Figure II.7) 

? Investigate the geological control on the seismicity distribution (selected 
profiles in Figure II.8). 

We also completed the geological information with NEAREST and IAM wide-
angle reflection/refraction profiles.

II.3.1.ARRIFANO Survey 

The ARRIFANO (ARc RIFANO) MCS survey was carried out in 1992 (AR92) 
onboard the R/V OGS-Explora as part of a research project funded by the 
Italian Consiglio Nazionale delle Recerche (Sartori et al., 1994). The acquisition 
equipment included 32 air guns array, with a volume of 80 L, a 3 km long 
streamer (with 120 receiver channels in 25 m groups). The shooting interval 
was 50 m, the sampling rate 2 ms and the record extended to 13 or 14s TWT.   

Seismic processing was performed in the Istituto di Geologia Marina of Bologna 
and included resampling to 4ms, CDP (common depth point) gathering, spiking 
deconvolution, velocity analysis, normal moveout correction, stacking, spherical 
divergence correction, sum adjacent 12.5 CDPs, finite-difference wave-equation 
migration and time-variable filter. The time migration was made using stacking 
velocity with a reduction 10% (Sartori et al., 1994). 

Afterwards, Rovere et al. (2004) reprocessed the 275km westernmost part of 
the AR01 profile (Figure II.8). The processing sequence included trace editing, 
amplitude balancing, normal moveout correction (NMO), common-midpoint 
stacking, predictive deconvolution, finite-difference time migration and time 
variant band-pass filtering. This section of the profile was pre-stack depth 
migrated. In Zitellini et al. (2001) is presented the AR-10 depth converted 
(location in Figure II.8).

II.3.2.BIGSET Survey 

The BIG Sources of Earthquake and Tsunami (BIGSET) survey was carried out 
on the RV/ Urania of the Italian Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, in the area 
offshore the Cabo de São Vicente. The project was founded by the European 
Community (Zitellini et al., 2010).  

The MCS reflection profiles were acquired using 4 SODERA-SSI GI-GUN air 
gun array, with a total volume ranging from 6.9 L to 8.2 L for deeper penetration 
survey. The high resolution survey was acquired using a single air gun with 
volume of 2.46 L. The pressure was set to 138 bar and 130-200 bars, for deep 
penetration and high resolution surveys, respectively. The streamer was 1200 
m long, with 48 active channels in 25 m groups. The cable was at depth ranging 
between 6 to 10 m and near offset was set between 142 and 158 m. The 
shooting interval was variable between 25, 37.5, 50 and 100 m. A pre-amplified 
gain was set to 30 db, the sample rate was 1 ms and the data record length 
between 8 and 13 s. The primary navigation system was DGPS (Zitellini et al., 
2010). 

The data was recorded in SEG-D format. The procedure for MCS processing 
included: load geometry with CMP folding between 6 or 16 or 24 (100, 37.5, 25 
m between shots); re-sampling to 4 ms; band-pass filter: 6-9-58-62.5Hz; edit 
traces; hand statics:-20ms; true amplitude recovery; gapped deconvolution: 
decon operator length 400 ms and prediction distance 24 ms; CMP sorting; 
interactive velocity analysis; NMO correction and stacking; top mute; finite-
difference time migration; time and space variant Ormsby band pass filter and 
automatic gain control (Zitellini et al., 2010). 

II.3.3.IAM Survey  

The Iberian Atlantic Margin (IAM) project was financed by the European 
Community Joule Program and coordinated by Enric Banda and Montserrat 
Torne from the Institute of Earth Sciences, Consejo Superior de Investigationes 
Cientificas (CSIC, Banda et al., 1995). This project explored the nature of the 
deep continental and oceanic crust in the Atlantic Iberia Margins. The 
acquisition campaign was designed to acquire near-vertical incidence reflection 
data complemented by on-shore and offshore wide-angle and refraction data on 
a few selected profiles, from the Cantabrian margin to the Gulf of Cadiz. In total 
3700 km of MCS seismic data were acquired on 19 lines. 43 land stations and 
19 OBS (Ocean Bottom Seismometers) were used for the acquisition of 
refraction and wide-angle reflection data. GECO-PRAKLA was in charge of the 
marine acquisition and it took place on board of the M/V GECO SIGMA, from 
August to September of 1993. 

The IAM multichannel reflection seismic profiles were acquired using a 36 
SWAG air-gun array with a total volume of 120 L and a pressure of 2000 psi. 
The source depth was of 15 m and the shot interval of 75 m. The receivers were

displayed in a streamer with 192 groups with an interval of 25 m, with five 
auxiliary channels. The cable was at a depth of 18m. The near offset defined in-
line was 254 m. The streamer length, between the centre of the first and last 
receiver group, was 4775 m. The sample rate was 4ms and the record length 
25 s. No low-cut filter was applied in the acquisition system only a high-cut filter 
at 92 Hz with a slope of 72 dB/oct and a gain constant of 24 dB. The primary 
navigation system was DGPS. 

The acquisition format was SEG-D 20 bit binary, afterwards it was de-
multiplexed and converted to SEG-Y in the pre-processing sequence. The 
available raw data was subdivided in five files in SEG-Y IBM floating point, Big 
Endian with headers in EBCDIC format. The 8 initial traces are auxiliary (test). 

The processing sequence by Geco-Prakla comprised reformat from acquisition 
format SEG-D to SEG-Y, bandpass filter with low cut 6 Hz(36dB/oct) and an 
anti alias high cut 55Hz (130 dB/oct), temporal resampling to 8ms, trace edit, 
trace equalisation, spherical divergence correction using constant velocity 
function (1500m/s at 0ms and 6000m/s at 14000ms), least square predictive 
deconvolution, FK demultiple, Normal moveout correction, space variant front 
end and inner trace mute, spherical divergence compensation, stacking, noise 
attenuation F-K filter, Kirchhoff constant velocity (1700 m/s) time migration and 
time-space variant band-pass filtering. Jiménez-Munt et al. (2010) converted to 
depth the IAM-4 (Figure II.8) seismic profile using variable velocities of 1500 
m/s for seawater, 2250 m/s to 3000 m/s for the sediment cover based on results 
proposed by Gónzalez et al. (1998). 

In the present work we reprocessed and depth converted the IAM-GB1 profile 
(location in Figure II.8). The processing sequence included trace muting, in-line 
geometry trace editing, velocity analysis, NMO correction, predictive 
deconvolution, stacking, time migration and depth conversion. An overview on 
some of the processing background is presented in this chapter and details on 
processing parameters will be described in Appendix V. 

II.3.4.NEAREST Wide-angle reflection/refraction profiles 

The NEAREST project refraction profiles were acquired onboard of the Spanish 
research vessel R/V Hesperides in 2008. Two profiles were acquired (see 
Figure II.8):  

1. Profile P1 is 340 km-long and resulted from a 30 OBS deployment array 
starting at the Tagus Abyssal plain and extending to Seine Abyssal plain 
(strike approximately NW-SE), crossing the Gorringe Bank topographic 
high;

Universitaire Europeen de la Mer), 17 short-period L2000s model from the 
Spanish UTM (Unitat de Tecnologia Marina) and 9 Hathor landstations also 
provide by UTM. The seismic source comprised two arrays with 7 Bolt airguns 
(model 1500 LL), providing a total volume of 70 L. The arrays were deployed at 
a depth of 12 m, and the shot interval was set to 90 s. The processing details 
and interpretation were published in Sallarès et al. (2013) and Martínez- 
Loriente et al. (2014) for profile P1 and Sallarès et al. (2011) for profile P2.  

II.3.5.SWIM -2006 survey 

The SWIM -2006 survey was carried out onboard the R/V Hesperides in 2006 
as part of the Collaborative Research Project from European Science 
Foundation EuroMargins SWIM (“Earthquakes and Tsunami Hazards in the 
SouthWest Iberian Margin: High-resolution imaging of active faults and 
paleoseismic signature”).  

A total of 16 profiles were acquired with 8 air guns array at a depth of 6m, with a 
total volume of 17 L and a pressure of 2000 psi. The shooting interval was 25 m 
to 37.5 m. The streamer had an active section of 2400 m with 96 recording 
channels (in a group interval of 25 m). The near offset was 216 m and the cable 
was at 7 m depth. The sampling rate was 2 ms with a pre-amplified gain of 20 
db, the record length ranged between 9 and 11s. The primary navigation 
system was DGPS 

The processing work involved resampling to 4ms, trace editing, static recording 
delay correction, true amplitude recovery, top mute, F-K and bandpass 
frequency filter, predictive deconvolution, NMO correction (with constant 
velocity of 1700 m/s), stacking, spiking deconvolution, Stolt FK migration (1500 
m/s) and final band-pass filtering. Final stacks and time migrated profiles were 
exported in SEG-Y format (Gràcia and Scientific-Party, 2006). 

Pre-stack depth migrated and seismic interpretations of most of the SWIM 
profiles are published in Martínez-Loriente et al. (2013). 

II.3.6.VOLTAIRE survey 

The Valuation Of Large Tsunamis And Iberia Risk for Earthquakes (VOLTAIRE) 
project was supported by Italian and Portuguese funding Agencies. The 
VOLTAIRE survey was carried out on/board of the RV/Urania. The research 
area was located on the SW margin of the Iberia, from the eastern border of the 
Tagus Abyssal Plain to the Guadalquivir Bank.   

The VOLTAIRE MCS reflection profiles were acquired using a 2 SODERA-SSI 
GI-GUN air gun array, with a volume of 3.4 L. The shot interval was set to 50 m.

The receivers were displayed in a streamer with 48 groups with an interval of 
12.5 m. The cable was at a depth of 9 m. The sample rate was 1 ms and the 
record length ?12 s. The primary navigation system was DGPS. 

The data was recorded in SEG-D format. The processing sequence included: 
re-sampling to 2 ms; edit traces; shot delay removal; true amplitude recovery; 
predictive deconvolution; CMP sorting; velocity analysis every 200 CMPs; NMO 
correction and stacking; band-pass filter and time migration using stacking 
velocity with a reduction 10% (Zitellini, Matias, Rovere and Scientific-Party, 
2002). 

II.4. Processing the seismological data 

The processing sequence of the seismological data included the following steps 
express in the Figure II.9. Events detection and phase identification were made 
in collaboration with Martin Romsdorf from AWI (Romsdorf, 2010). 

 
Figure II.9- Passive seismic data processing sequence. 

II.4.1.Detection and extraction 

The seismicity identification is based on the principle that we can distinguish an 
earthquake from the continuous ambient noise record in a seismogram. Local 
seismicity signal is characterized by an impulsive start, high frequency waves, 
an exponential amplitude envelope and a decrease in signal frequency in time. 
Another feature transversal to all type of seismic events (local, regional or 
teleseismic) is that the dominant wave period generally increases with time, 
starting from the moment of the first arrival, while other transient signals usually 
maintain the same dominant period throughout the duration of the events (Lee 
and Stewart, 1981). The identification of these events can be performed using 
different techniques; in our particular case we used spectrogram and automatic 
triggering analysis.  

II.4.1.1.Spectrogram analysis 

The spectrogram analysis consists of the examination of the average spectral 
content of the seismograms recorded in the vertical seismometer component. 
Daily spectrograms can be generated and converted into bitmap images, 
allowing the interpreter to visually identify spectral amplitude variations during 
seismic events by changes in a predefined colour palette. When stations in the

same area are plotted together, then an earthquake can be recognized as a 
linear alignment in the spectrogram.  

To define the spectrogram, n spectral points are extracted (that must be a 
power of 2) and centred in each sample to be analysed. The Fast Fourier 
Transform (FFT) of that series is then computed. The FFT will transform the 
seismic signal from temporal into its frequency domain, needed to compute the 
spectrogram. There is no windowing applied to the data; only the linear trend is 
extracted. Ultimately, n/2 spectral amplitude points are produced. These 
amplitudes are averaged, decimated and plotted in the spectrogram (Figure 
II.10). The size of the sliding time-window, the averaging and plot limits define 
the frequency interval and the spectral window that is plotted. 

 
Figure II.10- Spectrogram of the vertical component in the NEAREST seismometers. An 
seismic events is observed as a linear disturbance common (in this example) to all stations 
(OBS 2 and 11 were not acquiring data). 

II.4.1.2.Automatic triggering analysis 

Different types of triggering algorithms are available, whether based on 
amplitude changes only or using more complex recognition systems. The ‘short-
time-average through long-time-average’ (STA/LTA) trigger algorithm is the 
more commonly used.  

The STA/LTA algorithm calculates the average values of the absolute amplitude 
of the seismic signal in two consecutive moving time windows. The short time 
window (STA) scans for a seismic event and the long-time window (LTA) 
defines the background amplitude of the seismic noise. When the ratio of STA 
/LTA (trigger ratio) reaches a pre-set value an event is declared. The event is 
considered finished when the STA /LTA ratio decreases to another pre-set 
value - detrigger ratio.  

The length of the STA and LTA windows depend on the distance between the 
sensors and the average distance to a seismological active zone (Munro, 2004 
and references within). The STA window must be defined for a period superior 
to the expected duration of the seismic event. However, it should not be 
significantly longer than the shortest event to be investigated. If the window is 



Strain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate 
boundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia 
 

46 
 

very large, it no longer defines the envelope signal signature of the expected 
seismic event but the average amplitude of this event and the background 
seismic noise. Consequently, the sensitivity to detect small earthquake events 
(local events) is reduced. Hence the type (local vs distant) of events to be 
identified should be selected and prioritized. On the other hand, decreasing the 
STA window increases the sensitivity of the algorithm and this can induce 
triggering of false events. The LTA window should be a few periods longer than 
the typical irregular seismic noise variations. A typical LTA window is 60s. 

The selection of the STA/LTA trigger threshold level is a crucial step because it 
determines which events will be extracted. High STA/LTA trigger threshold level 
decrease false triggering but could exclude a higher number of earthquakes. 
Defining a lower threshold level increases both false positives and events 
detection. In quiet seismic sites, the typical trigger threshold value is 4, but for 
stations located far from any man-made noise, such as deep marine 
environments, this value can be lower. The de-trigger threshold level 
determines the extension of the event detected. Very high levels prevent the 
extraction of long events while low levels include longer records with 
unnecessary data.   

Another important parameter is the triggering pre-filter design. The filter is 
critical particularly for broadband seismometers with large response band 
(LOBSTER-60s-50Hz). The pre- triggering filter helps prioritize the frequencies 
to the dominant range of the seismic event of interest and attenuate or discard 
the effects of unwanted seismic background noise. Limiting the extraction of 
events when detected in a predefined number of seismic stations excludes 
earthquakes that cannot be located (details on the used triggering parameters 
are in the subchapter III.2.1).  

II.4.2.Earthquake location 

The earthquake location is defined by the hypocenter coordinates and origin in 
time. It can be determined from absolute or relative methods. In absolute 
techniques, events locations are referred to fix geographical and time systems 
while in relative methods earthquakes are located based in another event 
(master event) or relative to each other.  

The determination of absolute earthquake locations depends on several factors 
including survey network geometry, seismic phase identification and accuracies 
of the arriving time readings. Another important factor is the influence of the 
velocity structure of the crust and mantle that are traversed by the seismic rays. 
The application of one dimensional velocity models to determine hypocenter 
location in a tri-dimensional variable space also creates limitations. This 
problem is particularly dominant when there is a high lateral variability in the 
lithospheric structure. To minimize the latter aspect, absolute location methods 



II. Data and methods 

47 
 

can include station corrections or jointly determine velocities, hypocenters 
locations and station delays.  

Relative location (e.g. double difference earthquake location algorithms) 
methods can also minimize errors resulting from tri-dimensional geological 
variability. Even when using simultaneous inversion techniques with stations 
corrections, improvements can still be made by using the double difference 
technique too. The double-difference method allows a precise earthquake 
location because it is based on the similitude between seismic events within the 
same cluster. A description of the main background concepts behind 
earthquake location is provided in the next section.  

II.4.2.1.Stating the problem 

The earthquake locations are determined based on the records registered in the 
seismometers located on the Earth’s surface. Features, such as arrival time and 
amplitudes of the seismic waves are recorded by the seismic network. The 
location of the earthquake is then derived by matching an observed arrival time 
for seismic phases at the seismic stations and the calculated arrival times 
based on a hypothetical source location. Plausible velocity models are used to 
calculate theoretical arrival times. Hence, determining events location is an 
inverse problem where the observed data is arrival time and the unknowns are: 
spatial coordinates of the hypocenter, the origin time and velocity model. The 
forward problem is expressed mathematically by: 

=  ( , ) (1) 

Where d is the arrival time, m is the location model and  denotes the velocity 
model. In the forward problem, changes in d derived from known modifications 
in  ( , ) can be predicted. By contrast, the inverse problem involves solving 
the changes in  ( , ) that yield the required data d. The best model is the one 
that produces the smallest misfit (tres) between the observed data ( ) and the 
predicted data ( ):  

= ? (2) 

For a source location ?src (x) and recording station coordinates ?sta (x), the 
arrival time can be defined by: 

= +  =  + ? ( )  (3) 

Where t0 is the origin time, u is the model slowness (inverse of the seismic 
velocity) and x denotes a vector of spatial coordinates reproducing the ray path. 
Any change to the location results in the alteration of the ray path, and 
consequently of the seismic velocity. Similarly, changing the seismic velocity 
modifies the arrival time and therefore the earthquake location. This 
dependence is nonlinear and is referred as the coupled hypocenter-velocity 
problem. The hypocenter parameters, except for the origin time, are strongly 



Strain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate 
boundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia 
 

48 
 

nonlinear and velocity parameters are moderately nonlinear (Kissling et al. 
1994). Applying a first-order Taylor series expansion to (2, 3) yields a linear 
relationship between travel time residuals (tres) and adjustments in hypocentral 
(? ) and velocity (? ) parameters (e.g Kissling et al., 1994)  

= ?  = ? , ?? + ? , ?     (4) 

In matrix notation: 

= ? +        (5) 

Where t is the vector of travel time residuals, H is the matrix of partial derivates 
of travel time with respect to hypocentral parameters (origin spatial coordinates 
and time) and h a vector with hypocentral parameters adjustments, M is the 
matrix of partial derivates of travel time with respect to velocity model 
parameters and m the vector of velocity model adjustments. 

Assuming that the velocity model is known (based on previous seismological 
and refractions data), the location problem can be reduced to hypocentral 
parameters by removing the Mm from the linearized approximation. In that 
case: 

= ?  = ? , ??       (6) 

And in detail for a station : 

 = ? + ? + ? + ?      (7) 

Or in the matrix notation: 

 = ?     (8) 

The formulation of the earthquake location problem in this linear form is known 
as the Geiger method. However, ignoring the velocity parameter in the 
earthquake location problem introduces systematic errors to our solutions 
(Kissling et al., 1994). A successful solution can only be reached by 
constraining the initial velocity model based on dense geophysical data. The 
Geiger method (and modified versions) is used in several location programs 
including the HYPOCENTER 3.2 (details on Lienert, 1994) integrated in the 
SEISAN 9.01 package (Havskov and Ottemöller, 2011) used for the preliminary 
location of earthquakes in our study.  

Once an adequate velocity model has been established, the location is 
constrained by the hypocentre parameters which represent 4 unknowns (the 
hypocenter coordinates and their origin in time). A solving equation is devised 
for each arrival time. The system can be determined using three seismic 
stations with four phase picking. However, a seismic network commonly has 
considerably more observations and the problem is overdetermined, meaning 
that a unique solution cannot be obtained. However, using a higher number of 



II. Data and methods 

49 
 

recording stations allows to constrain redundancy errors in arrival times related 
to phase picking, clock synchronization, reading errors and systematic 
discrepancies between real velocity structure and velocity model.  

An iterative approximation starting with a trial hypocenter solution (derived from 
the closest station) is used to solve the system with iterative corrections applied 
until the best solution is reached, minimizing the difference between observed 
and calculated arrival times in M stations. For most locations, programs use root 
mean square approximation to define the best solution: 

=  ?      (9) 

Where  is the temporal difference between the  and  (for a station  
and a event source ). 

II.4.2.2.Joint Hypocentral Determination (JHD) 

Assuming that the 1 D velocity model is well constrained, station correction 
delays must also be applied to yield the correct location of the earthquakes. 
These corrections combine not only errors related to the record acquisition and 
processing but also associated with the tri-dimensional subsurface geological 
structure variability below the seismic network. The Joint Hypocentral 
Determination (JHD) technique uses the simultaneous location of a group of 
events and common station corrections determinations. According to Pujol 
(2000), the resulting stations corrections can be related to un-modeled lateral 
velocity variations.  

The JHD is distinct from single-event location approaches because it includes a 
stations corrections term ( ). Considering a group of earthquakes M recorded 
in N stations the JHD formulation is: 

   = ( + + + + )    (11) 

With  

i=1, N;     j=1, M 

and 

 =  ? ( + +  )      (12) 

Where  is the observed arrival time and the remaining terms of the equation 
refers to the calculated arrival time,  being the computed initial origin time,  
the travel time based on a hypothetical hypocentral location and   is the initial 
stations corrections. The term   refers to quality weights in stations readings. 
The partial derivates elements are the adjustments that must be determined. 

In matrix notations the equation can be written as: 

 + =       = 1,      (13) 



Strain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate 
boundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia 
 

50 
 

Where W is the stations weight matrix, A is the adjustments partial derivates, 
dXj is the earthquake locations corrections, ds the stations delays and rj is the 
residuals vector. The JHD problem must solve all the terms of the equation 
simultaneously (see Pujol, 2000 for further details).  

An approximate JHD technique was introduced by Frolich (1979). It uses single-
events location and average stations residuals (Pujol, 2000), and adopts the 
following processing sequence: 

1. Determination of earthquake locations individually; 

2. Determination of  average individual station delays based on all 
earthquakes; 

3. Determination of the individual locations of earthquakes using 
stations corrections from step 2; 

4. Iteratively improvement of earthquake location by repeating steps 1-
3. 

This is equivalent to solving the different terms of equation 13 individually. 
Solving step 1 corresponds to solving equation 13 for ds=0 and step 2 without 
earthquake location term. The station residuals are defined by (Pujol, 2000): 

=
?

?
     (14) 

An JHD approximation was applied in data investigated here by combining 
HYP2 (a modified version by Luis Matias of HYP application from SEISAN 9.2 
package, Havskov and Ottemöller, 2011) which allowed individual stations 
delays for p and s readings.  

II.4.2.3.Simultaneous inversion  

An accurate constraint of the velocity structure of the crust and upper mantle for 
a determined region is very difficult to obtain. In particular, excluding velocity 
parameters from the coupled hypocentre-velocity formulation (eq. 5) can 
introduce systematic errors in earthquakes locations (Kissiling et al., 1994). In 
the simultaneous inversion method hypocentral, velocity and station correction 
are jointly determined. The formulation can be written in matrix notation as: 

= ? + +e     (15) 

Where t is the residuals between observed and calculated arrival times, H is the 
matrix of partial derivates of travel time with respect to hypocentral parameters, 
h is the vector of hypocentral parameters adjustments, M is the matrix of partial 
derivates of the travel time with respect to velocity model, m is the vector of 
velocity model adjustments and e is the vector of travel time errors, resulting 
from errors in observations (stations coordinates, in measurements), in the use 
of wrong hypocentral and velocity parameters and errors related to the 
linearization of the coupled hypocentre-velocity formulation. 



II. Data and methods 

51 
 

This formulation is highly dependent on the parameterization of the problem. 
One of the limitations derives from the velocity model layers structure used as 
input. During processing steps, the velocity value of each layer can fluctuate to 
find a better solution for events location. On the contrary, the number of layers 
and its thickness remains fixed. Therefore the validity of the hypocentre-velocity 
formulation solution is dependent on the specific structure of the initial velocity 
model. One way to overcome this limitation is to use previous knowledge on 
interface depth (e.g. refraction-reflection seismic profiles) to limit interface 
depths distribution. In the absence of previous data, several layers structures 
should be tested without exaggerated complexity. Beyond a determined 
complexity, the model becomes unrealistic. Moreover, the earthquakes ray 
paths does not comply with the necessary constraints to solve the model 
variability and the problem becomes underdeterminate.  

Other restrictions originate from hypocentral distribution if earthquakes have 
limited depth distributions. In this case, the velocity model converges rapidly to 
an optimum solution within these layers but may not achieve a constrained 
solution for depth intervals having low earthquakes distributions. The best 
solution is obtained in the layers common to most ray-paths between the source 
area and all the seismic stations. Consequently, less accuracy is expected in 
subsurface layers below seismic stations and below the depth limit of the 
distribution of the hypocenters. In our study we used the VELEST (details on 
the method in Kissiling, 1995) application to compute the velocity model, the 
locations and stations corrections (see chapter III.3.2). 

II.4.2.4.Relative location methods based on double difference (HypoDD)  

As referred before, one of the main constrains on earthquake location comes 
from using one dimensional velocity models (even if well known) to determine 
hypocenters locations in a tri-dimensional variable lithosphere. We can 
minimize this difficulty by using 3-D simultaneous inversion methods or, 
alternatively, double-difference techniques.  

The double difference approximation for earthquake location is based on the 
assumption that if two events are recorded in the same station and the 
hypocentral distance between them is smaller than the events-station distance 
as well as the lateral variability of the velocity model then the ray-paths are 
similar along most of the distance linking events origin-recording station. So, the 
difference in travel times is related to the space offset in events sources and it is 
not necessary to use station corrections.  

The accuracy between relative arrivals times can be improved by waveform 
cross-correlation, assuming that both events are related to the same source 
mechanism and therefore produce similar seismic signatures in a common 
recording station (Waldhouser and Ellsworth, 2000). The method can be used in 
cluster analysis but also in larger distances by cross-correlating pairs of events 
across the area (see Figure II.11). A minimum distance within pairs of events

must be respected as a condition. In these, the slowness component in 
equation 3 must be constant across ray-paths to the receiver station.  

 
Figure II.11- Double difference method. Solid and open circles represent trial hypocenters that 
are linked to neighboring events by cross-correlation (solid lines) or catalog (dashed lines) data. 
For two events, i and j, the initial locations (open circles) and corresponding slowness vectors, 
s, with respect to two stations, k and l, are shown. Thick arrows (?x) indicate the re-location 
vector for events i and j obtained with double difference method and dt is the travel-time 
difference between the events i and j observed at station k and l, respectively (from Waldhouser 
and Ellsworth, 2000). 

Equation (6) can be rewritten for events i and j as: 

?  ??  =    (16) 

Where ?  is the difference relative hypocentral parameters for events i and j, 

 are partial derivates of travel time between event source and receiver station 

(including a component of slowness). is the residual between observed and 
calculated arrival times between the two events: 

= ( ? ) ?  ( ? )     (17) 

To assure that the slowness vector across the raypaths is constant this 
difference can be written as: 

?  ?? ?  ?  ??  =    (18) 

Assuming a slowness vector and origin time for each event. 

Solutions are found by iteratively adjusting the vector difference between 
nearby hypocentral pairs, with the locations and partial derivatives being 
updated after each iteration (Waldhauser, 2001). The double-difference 
residuals for pairs of earthquakes at each station are minimized by weighted 
least squares. We used HypoDD program package (Waldhauser, 2001) for 
relocating our dataset with the double-difference algorithm (details in chapter 
III.3.3).

II.4.3.Determine focal mechanisms and the regional stress tensor 

II.4.3.1.Introduction  

The way rocks react to stress depends on how large the stress is and for how 
long it is applied. Provided the applied stress remains below the yield stress 
(elastic limit) the short-term behaviour is elastic. An earthquake takes place 
when the elastic yield strength of the local rocks is exceeded and failure occurs. 
However, away from the rupture area the rocks’ coherence is preserved. 
Seismic waves will therefore spread out by elastic deformation inducing ground 
motions reflecting the relative movement of the two sides of a source fault. 
These seismic waves are recorded in seismic stations. If earthquakes are 
caused by faulting then we can deduce the fault kinematics from an adequate 
set of seismograms and in turn the characteristics of the stress field acting on 
that region, as discussed below. 

II.4.3.2.Focal mechanism 

For most micro or local earthquakes networks, fault plane solutions are derived 
only from P-wave first motion polarity. Compared to waveform inversion 
methods, P-wave first motion polarities are still useful to constrain the source 
mechanisms for micro-seismicity studies, due to their waveform complexities 
that cannot be modelled by simple and smooth velocity structures. Figure II.12a 
shows the P-wave radiation pattern for a pure-strike slip fault. Since the 
radiation pattern of the seismic wave is dependent on the fault geometry and 
kinematics we can use it to work out the fault plane solution. If the radiation 
pattern induces the material to move away from the source fault area, then the 
first motion is compression. By contrast, if the material moves towards the fault 
source then the first motion is dilation. On the receiver stations, the 
seismograms record positive polarities, or upwards P-wave first motion, and 
negative polarities, or downwards P-wave first arrivals, respectively (see Figure 
II.12a). 

The locations of compressions and dilatations leaving the fault zone are defined 
as points in a focal sphere. The first arrival polarities (observed at the receiver 
stations) are represented in the lower hemisphere and projected using the equal 
area stereographic representation. This is depicted in Figure II.12b. Each 
receiver station defines a polarity measure on the focal sphere (solid represents 
compression and open refers to dilatations -Figure II.12c). The first motions will 
delineate four quadrants, separated by two nodal planes (fault and auxiliary 
fault planes) along which there is no radiation of P-waves. The bisectrices of 
dilatation and compression quadrants are coincident in the maximum and 
minimum compression directions, respectively (Figure II.12d). The maximum 
stress is denoted by the P-axis while the minimum stress direction is defined as 
the T-axis. The B axis- indicates the intermediate stress and is perpendicular to 
both P and T axes. Note that from the radiation pattern in Figure II.12a it is

boundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia 
 

54 
 

impossible to define which is the preferable fault plane. The solutions for both P 
and T axes define a force system that is defined as a “double-couple” (or DC). 
Non-DC sources, representative of complex rupture histories or including an 
“explosive” component, cannot be evaluated by the P-wave polarity method 
outlined here. 

The focal mechanism solutions are defined by strike, dip and rake. Strike ? is 
measured between 0° and 360º. The convention for its measurement assumes 
that: the strike direction is defined by the horizontal line in the foot-wall of the 
fault-plane and its orientation is established by the right-hand rule. The dip ? is 
measured perpendicularly to the strike direction and the rake ? is the direction 
along the slip on the fault and is bounded between – 180° and 180°, where 
reverse fault is 0°&lt;?&lt;180°, normal faults between -180° and 0° and right lateral 
strike-slip if ?=180° and left if ?=0° (Snoke, 2003). In this work two different 
methods (FOCMEC and FPFIT) were applied to estimate the focal mechanism 
solution. Both methods use a grid-search method to find the best fitting focal 
mechanism for the observed polarities.

Cross-correlation and sequence analysis 

Cross-correlation analysis is used to compare the P and/or S waves of closely 
related earthquakes that could result from the same seismic source. For closely 
related seismic activity it can be useful to define the location and geometry of 



II. Data and methods 

55 
 

the seismogenic source zone. This is particularly reliable in seismic crisis, 
where seismic activity is highly concentrated both in time and space. Here, this 
analysis was applied to identify closely related events, re-locate them with JHD 
method and compute a composite focal mechanism. The cross-correlation 
function is defined by: 

( , ?, ) = ? ( + )?( )    (19) 

Where ( ) and ?( ) are two seismic signals while  is the time lag between the 
two waveforms. For &gt; 0, ( ) delayed with respect to ?( ) and vice-versa. In 
fact, two waveforms recorded at the same stations and related to events with 
similar/coincident locations are expected to have coherent phase picking. 
However, even for that particular scenario several aspects can impose 
discrepancies between the events picking:   

1. Phase picking is a subjective procedure; 

2. Variability in signal to noise ratio; 

3. Events magnitude. 

A normalised cross-correlation function is often used to reduce the influence of 
the waveform energy:  

( , ?, ) =  ( , , )
( , ) ( , )

   (20) 

Where ( , ) and (?, ?) defines the auto-correlation function. 

The cross-correlation is performed by the multicorr application. It cross-
correlates a given set of waveforms based on predefined parameters: the 
number of samples to compare, the time window and the correlation limits. 
Several indexes are obtained as outputs: compared events identification, cross-
correlation value (1.0 for identical events), time lag of the waveforms and signal 
to noise ratio. The signal to noise ratio is computed by auto-correlating each 
event waveform in two time windows, one preceding and the other during the 
earthquake. Cross-correlation computation retrieves the average signal to noise 
ratio for the compared events. This parameter can be used to evaluate the 
reliability of the identified similarity. Multicorr outputs the index described above 
in individual files, identified by station component.  

Events sequences are determined based on the output of multicorr. The 
application matrix-sup extracts the events that are defined as a sequences 
based on the following parameters: 

1. A minimum correlation value; 

2. A interval of signal to noise ratio to consider the above calculations; 

For each sequence determined, files storing the events collection are created. 
The reliability of the results is tested by visual inspection of selected events

boundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia 
 

56 
 

waveforms and by the proximity of events locations. Details on the cross-
correlation and sequence analysis are presented in chapter III.4.2.1. 

II.4.3.3.Determining the regional stress tensor  

To determine the stress tensor based on focal mechanism data, P, B and T 
axes are considered good approximations to the principal stress directions ?1 
(maximum compression), ?2 and ?3, respectively. This is true for newly formed 
faults and ideal media without internal friction, where focal mechanism nodal 
planes match the maximum shear stress planes (Gephart and Forsyth, 1990a). 
However, in most geodynamic settings, the reactivation of pre-existing faults 
prevails since the stress needed to form new faults is considerably higher. In 
these cases, the directions of slip in a single fault (or in a limited number of 
faults) can diverge substantially from the regional principal maximum stress 
directions derived by the focal mechanism analysis. The direction of slip should 
be the one that coincides with the maximum shear stress direction on the fault 
plane. Additionally, the principal stress directions can be identified by 
considering the direction of slip in several faults for an area of uniform stress. In 
such a case, resulting focal mechanisms solutions are consistent with a limited 
number of common stress directions. By combining several observations, a 
range of matching solutions can be obtained for the local stress field.  

Stress limits to pre-existing fault slip  

The stress acting on a fault plane can be resolved in two components: the 
normal stress (?N) and the shear stress (?S), perpendicular and parallel to the 
plane, respectively. The ?N inhibits sliding and ?S promote it. In an isotropic 
medium a new fault will be formed if the applied stress exceeds the rocks 
strength. However, pre-existent faults have neither tensile nor cohesive 
strength; as a result failure occurs as long as frictional resistance to slip is 
overcome. The frictional resistance to slide is related to the normal stress acting 
on the surface, friction is directly proportional to the normal force. Other 
controlling factors are inherent to rock type and the fault surface. The 
roughness of the fault surface contradicts sliding, as the movement starts and 
promotes surface smoothness and decrease slide resistance.  

Here, the Focal Mechanism Stress Inversion (FMSI) package from Gephart 
(1990) was used to define the best-fitting regional stress tensor compatible with 
the majority of observed earthquake focal mechanisms (for detailed aspects of 
the background theory see Gephart and Forsyth (1984) and Gephart (1990a, 
1990b)). In Gephart and Forsyth (1984), the condition of slip on fault plane is 
defined according with the following assumptions: there is no shear slip 
perpendicular to the fault (in the direction of ); and the maximum shear stress 
( ) is in the direction of slip: 

= ? cos 2    (21) 



II. Data and methods 

57 
 

= sin 2    (22) 

Where  is the angle between the fault plane and direction of maximum 
compression (. ). 

The inversion method 

In the FMSI application the inversion process will find best fitting stress model to 
the focal mechanism data using a grid search approach and assuming a local 
uniform stress field. It is implicit that both the fault plane (two possibilities exist 
from the focal mechanism solution) and stress directions are unknown. 
Accordingly, a primary measure of the inversion model is the misfit between 
predicted and observed data (stress model and fault planes solutions).  

The resulting stress model comprises the principal stress directions and 
additional a value R, the Stress Ratio, that is defined as: 

= ( )
( )

   (23) 

R gives a measure of the relative magnitude of the stress, because of the 
assumption that ? ? , R is limited between 1 and 0. In the special case 
of hydrostatic stress R=0, in triaxial compressive domains R tends to 1 because 

? ? , while in a tensile domain R tends to 0 with ? ? .  

As mentioned before, the aim of the inversion process is to find the stress and 
R parameters that reduces the discrepancies between the observations and the 
predicted model. The misfit is the smallest rotation about any axis that brings 
one of the nodal focal mechanism planes and its slip direction/sense of slip into 
an orientation that is consistent with the stress model (Gephart and Forsyth, 
1984). The discrepancies reflect not only relative rotations between the 
observations and model solutions but also errors in focal mechanism 
determinations and local stress variations (idem). If inconsistency between the 
inverted model and the observations result from stress variation it may be 
necessary to subdivide the initial dataset into subsets that sustain the 
assumption of uniformity. These subsets may be temporal or spatial limited. A 
focal mechanism with an inferred fault plane corresponding to a small value of 
shear stress must be considered suspect and can eventually be disregarded 
during the inversion procedure.

II.5. RE-processing IAM-GB1 multi-channel reflection profile  

II.5.1.Introduction  

This subchapter provides an overview of basic concepts of marine multichannel 
reflection profile acquisition and processing. Details of the acquisition of IAM-
GB1 and of the re-processing parameters are presented Appendix V. Essential 
concepts on marine multi-channel seismic reflection acquisition system are 
presented first because of their importance for the processing stages.  

The acquisition system is defined by the source model, the receiver sequence 
and the digital recording system. The source is a controlled artificial generated 
acoustic signal which result from explosions generated using different 
mechanisms: e.g. water steam (steam gun) or compressed air (airgun) 
injections or high electric pulses (sparker). Synchronized airguns arrays are the 
more common source for marine multi-channel acquisitions. The use of multiple 
airguns increases source energy and diminish bubble noise that affects data 
quality. The ideal source would produce a very short impulsive wavelet (Figure 
II.13a). However, isolated gas bubbles produced by an airgun oscillate and 
generate successive pulses (Figure II.13b) that cause source-induced noise. 
Airgun arrays can cause destructive interference of bubble pulses and alleviate 
the bubble noise using different volumes and towed at different depths (Figure 
II.13c).  

 
Figure II.13- A schematic example of ideal (a) and typical source-time functions produced by an 
airgun (b) and by an airgun array (c) in a marine experiment. In the airgun signal a series of 
bubble pulses are produced by pressure reverberations within the water which are attenuated 
with airgun combined array (from Shearer, 2009 and Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). 

Another basic part of the marine acquisition system is the receiver station, 
which is most commonly a streamer (Figure II.14). The streamer is a buoyant 
surface marine cable that comprises an array of hydrophone groups (channels).  

The hydrophones detect pressure changes induced by seismic waves’ 
propagation following successive explosions generated from different sources 
and which are recovered from different points along the pre-defined profile. This 
analogue response is subsequently converted to a digital signal (pre-amplified 



II. Data and methods 

59 
 

and pre-filtered) by an analogue-digital converter. The seismic signal is a 
continuous time function. The conversion into the digital domain (discrete 
record) is done using a fixed sample rate, typically between 1 and 4 ms for 
seismic reflection data. During digitalization the seismic signal would loses 
frequencies that are above a term defined as the Nyquist frequency, ƒN=(1/2?t), 
Where ?t is the sampling rate, e.g. a sampling rate of 4ms will lose all the 
frequencies above 125Hz (Yilmaz, 1993). In fact, frequencies greater the 
Nyquist frequency will be converted into low frequencies and undistinguished 
from the original seismic signal. This phenomenon is defined frequency aliasing 
and is exemplified in Figure II.15. To avoid this contamination of the digital 
signal its applied a anti-aliasing filter. Normally, a high-cut filter with the cut-off 
frequency between ¾ to ½ of the Nyquist frequency. 

 

 
Figure II.14- Marine acquisition system (Adapted from www.bgr.bund.de). 

 

The field geometry defined between the airgun array (as well explosion 
frequency), the streamer, the channel distribution within the streamer and the 
streamer extension depend on the scientific objectives of the acquisition 
campaign. The source and receiver spacing define a fundamental acquisition 
parameter: the fold. The marine multi-channel acquisitions operate in multiple 
cover system which consists in a multi-trace response observation (fold) of the 
same midpoint in a seismic profile, favouring an improved image of subsurface 
geology in that point: the common midpoint (CMP). Considering a sub-
horizontal layered medium, then a common midpoint (CMP) is located at half 
distance (offset) between the receiver and the shotpoint. The method is 
exemplified in Figure II.16. For example if the shooting interval and receiver 
distance are both 25m (D in Figure II.16), then the Common Mid-Point (CMP, 
represented as P in Figure II.16) distance is 12.5m (half the distance between 
receivers, D/2 in Figure II.16); the fold is be defined by:

 for a streamer with 96 receivers groups it is 48. So, the same point in the 
seismic profile will be sampled by 48 different channels and imaged by 48 
traces. This methodology is central to improve the signal to noise ratio, one of 
the main purpose of processing steps as discussed in the next subchapter.

VM are the water and first layer velocities, respectively dushed, full and point-dashed lines are 
ray path from source to Pn then reflected to receiver points in the streamer (from 
http://walter.kessinger.com/work/seisx_processing.html). 

II.5.2.Processing sequence 

The aim of marine seismic reflection data processing is to create an image of 
subsurface geology. This image results from the interaction between a relatively 
well- known artificial source with both the water and rock layers, and it is

61 
 

recorded in arrays of receiver stations. The prime interest resides in the P-wave 
primary reflections; the remaining energy is considered noise. Noise can be the 
energy of direct, refracted, diffracted or multiple reflected waves (Figure II.17) 
but it can also result from sea swell (direct or movement induced in recording 
cable), from the vessel, fish bites or moreover from electrical spikes in the 
recording system. Increasing signal to noise is one of the main objectives of 
seismic processing steps. All energy in the seismic data departing from the 
signal of interest are considered as noise. It can be subdivided into coherent 
(e.g. direct, refracted or diffracted waves) and incoherent noise (e.g. instrument 
or cable noise). The coherent noise is consistent from trace to trace while 
incoherent or random noise lack of continuity between adjacent traces. These 
characteristics are fundamental to select which processing steps to be used to 
enhance the signal and attenuate the noise. 

 
Figure II.17- Illustration of possible energy paths between the source and receivers arrays.  

There are three fundamental steps in seismic reflection data processing: 
deconvolution, stacking and migration. However, defining the appropriate 
sequence and processing parameters is a critical task. It depends on several 
factors such as acquisition parameters (instrumental and external conditions) 
and the study adequacy. In this case, two main objectives were considered 
when reprocessing IAM-GB1 profile: firstly, to improve seismic attributes 
observations in the acoustic basement and secondly to obtain a depth 
converted profile.  

II.5.2.1.Pre-processing steps 

A typical processing sequence starts with some preliminary steps. First, the 
data acquisition format is identified. The field data are usually time-sequenced 
meaning that samples from the same time for all channels are packed together. 
The sample from a time x in the channel 1 is stored next to the same time 
sample from channel 2. However, in seismic processing steps it is convenient to 
have the data stored by channel. All the time samples from each channel are 
stored together followed by those in the next channels. This process is called 
de-multiplexing. The next pre-processing step engages a preliminary quality 
check of the acquired data. Auxiliary channels, noisy traces are deleted and a 
frequency analysis of the data is made. Accordingly, the dominant spectrum of 



Strain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate 
boundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia 
 

62 
 

the recorded signal (and noise) is identified which will help to define which 
process and parameters are more adequate to attenuate undesirable noise.  

Another step applied in the pre-processing stage is a preliminary amplitude 
correction to compensate energy lost due to wave propagation in the medium, 
resulting in two main effects:  

1. Absorption resulting from the transformation of the elastic energy in 
heat during medium propagation. It will increase with depth and it will 
work as high-frequency filter. The correction can be applied based on 
time and space variant gain. Scattering also attenuates energy but its 
effect is like absorption and very difficult to separate. Both effects are 
considered and compensated together. 

2. Spherical divergence resulting from the dispersion of energy in 
wavefront, as a function of the increasing distance between the shot 
and the receiver. This energy attenuation it is proportional to 1?   for 
a homogenous medium; where r is the radius of the spherical 
wavefront. In a stratified earth, the energy decay is proportional to 
the velocity in each layer. We can use a preliminary velocity 
estimation of each layer to apply the correction or we can just define 
a constant velocity and improve latter on based on more detailed 
velocity analysis needed for the stacking stage. 

Finally, field geometry is taken into account based on the acquisition 
parameters. This step allow to short the data in CMP gathers and should 
precede any offset depend operation. Defining the correct geometry is 
fundamental for the reliability of remaining processing stages. Using wrong field 
parameters compromises the veracity of the final seismic image. 

II.5.2.2.Deconvolution  

The deconvolution aims at recovering the Earth signature in the seismic trace 
by eliminating the remaining noise and compressing the wavelet. Ideally, the 
seismic trace would only show the recorded earth response impulse (primary 
reflections) resulting from a spike wavelet source. However, the seismic trace 
comprises primary reflection plus a variety of multiples and noise from several 
sources, coherent and incoherent. Furthermore, the wavelet is not really a 
spike. 

The seismic trace can be defined as the convolution between the source 
wavelet and the earth’s response Yilmaz (2001): 

( ) = ( ) ? ( ) + ( ) 

Where ( ) is the seismic record, ( ) is the basic wavelet, ( ) is the Earth’s 
impulse response, ( ) is the random ambient noise and * denotes convolution. 
This is defined as convolutional model (see Figure II.18). In theory if we know 



II. Data and methods 

63 
 

the source wavelet form and succeed to eliminate the ambient noise then we 
could recover earth response.  

If we could assume that we have low ambient noise than: 

( ) = ( ) ? ( ) 

This is the main goal of deconvolution, to design an operator/filter ( ) that: 

( ) ? ( ) = ( ) 

If we combine the two last equations we would have: 

( ) = ( ) ? ( ) ? ( ) 

Than by excluding ( )  

( ) = ( ) ? ( ) 

With ( ) = 1 for t=0 and ( ) = 0 otherwise. 

( ) = 1 ? ?( ) 

Where ?( ) is the inverse of the wavelet.  

The seismic signal can be converted from time domain to frequency domain 
using forward Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The seismic signal can be define in 
the frequency domain as a sum of sinusoids, each one with a unique frequency, 
amplitude and phase. This is one fundamental base to seismic data analysis 
and seismic processing. The backwards synthesis of all frequency components 
into time-dependent signal is done using inverse Fourier transforms. Note that 
convolution is equivalent to multiplication in the frequency domain while addition 
remains the same operation. So in the frequency domain: 

( ) =
1
( )

 

Then the deconvolution operator or filter is the inverse of the wavelet. 

The importance of this operation is that in the frequency domain the wavelet 
and the seismic trace have similar signatures as is shown in Yilmaz (2001, in 
figure 2.13, here see  

Figure II.18). The same is also true for autocorrelation functions. In fact, wavelet 
and seismic trace autocorrelation functions are equal only where wavelet 
autocorrelation is non-zero (see  

Figure II.18).  



Strain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate 
boundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia 
 

64 
 

 
Figure II.18- The convolutional model. In the frequency spectrum and the autocorrelation 
functions of the wavelet (b) and the seismic trace (c) are similar (top and middle figures). 
Seismic trace is the convolution of t the earth impulse (a) response with a source wavelet in the 
time domain (bottom figure, from Yilmaz, 2001). 

So, the fraction that is not similar should represent the impulse response of the 
Earth. This means that the wavelet trace can be found in the seismic record and 
the earth impulse extracted. This is the key for predictive deconvolution, and 
has been applied in the IAM-GB1 re-processing workflow.  

II.5.2.3.CMP sorting, velocity analysis and stacking 

The multi-channel seismic profiles acquisition is defined with a multi-fold 
coverage. As a result a CMP is covered by several traces (Figure II.19A). For 
an homogeneous layer the horizontal reflector defines an hyperbolic curve on a 
CMP gather (Figure II.19B). On the other hand, the direct wave defines a 
straight line in a two-way time (TWT) versus offset display. In order to increase 
the signal to noise ratio by stacking (Figure II.19D) the redundant observations 
available on the CMP gather, the hyperbolic curve must be corrected into a 
horizontal line (Figure II.19C). This process is the normal moveout (NMO) 
correction and is defined as follows (Yilmaz, 1993):  

? = ( ) ? (0) = (0) + ? (0) 

Where ( ) is the time between the shot-point, CMP and receiver while (0) is 
the time if the shot-point location was coincident with the receiver and the CMP 
was just below, at a point in a perpendicular line (Figure II.19a). For a 
homogeneous layer NMOv is identical to the media seismic velocity. For a layered 
media with horizontal interfaces the travel-time curve of reflections is still 



II. Data and methods 

65 
 

approximately hyperbolic and the NMO correction is still valid. For horizontal 
layering the CMP coincides with the CDP (Common Depth Point). 

Note that if we consider that the reflector is not horizontal the CMP and CDP will 
be different (in fact there is no more a CDP) and the NMO correction is given 
by: 

? = (0) +
?

? (0) 

Where ?is the apparent dip of the reflector (or the dip at the seismic section). 

In a horizontally stratified medium, the travel time equation for a path between a 
source, a CMP at depth D and a receiver is (from Yilmaz, 1993):  

( ) = + … +  

With = (0), = 1?  and  is a complex function that depends on 
layers velocity and thickness, where  is the velocity down at depth of the 
reflector D: 

=
1
(0)

? (0) 

Where  is the interval velocity of the   layer. According to Yilmaz (1993) the 
travel time expression can be simplified if a small-spread approximation is 
considered, i.e. if the offset is smaller than the depth, then: 

( ) = (0) +  

For a horizontal layering   is equal to , the same assumption is applied 
for gentle dipping reflectors. 

According to the above-described, three fundamental aspects control the NMO 
correction: the seismic velocity of the medium along the ray path, the shot-
receiver distance and the reflectors depth. Hence, velocity analysis is an 
essential processing step that we will sum up next.

(adapted from http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Terms/c/common_midpoint.aspx). 

The velocity analysis is an interactive processing procedure that enables an 
interpretation of the NMO (stacking) velocities. It can be done using different 
methods. However, here only the semblance analysis is shown (Figure II.20). 
The semblance measures the similarity between adjacent traces by evaluating 
its fit into a possible hyperbolic trajectory. The result is TWT vs velocity display 
with a similitude scale (see left display in Figure II.20). The interpreter selects 
the velocities with maximum semblance and simultaneously examines the result 
in: 

1. CMP gather to verify the NMO correction of the reflectors (see centre 
display in Figure II.20); 

2. In preliminary stack to assure the reflectors lateral coherency (see 
right display in Figure II.20).     

These plots allow the interpreter to improve the NMO correction by correcting 
the stacking velocities to assure the horizontality of the reflectors. The final 
velocity model is used to generate the stacked section.

II.5.2.4.Time Migration and Depth Conversion 

Migration relocates the dipping reflectors into its true position and collapse 
diffractions. Figure II.21 shows a schematic representation of the migration 
principles (from Yilmaz, 2001). The true geometry of geological feature that 
generates reflector CD is represented in a depth-distance profile (see Figure 
II.21a). In a zero-offset (or stacking) time section, vertical incidence of the ray 
generated at the reflector CD is assumed and recorded at the receivers AB. As 
a result the original reflector CD, dipping ? is placed at position in C’D’, dipping 
?. Migration should position the C’D’ into a position/geometry closer to CD. The 
quantitative analysis of this migration process is described in Figure II.22 (from 
Yilmaz, 2001). The relations between horizontal and vertical displacements on 
the migrated and unmigrated sections are defined by the following formulas 
(see definitions in Figure II.22).

Several observations are made by Yilmaz (2001) based on the described 
equations and Figure II.22: 

The time dip at migrated sections are always greater than in stacking sections, 
i.e. ?

, or migration steepens reflectors; 

In event E, the horizontal displacement ?  increases with time t; 

Both horizontal and vertical displacements are dependent of the velocity 
selected for migration; 

The steeper events imply higher horizontal and vertical displacement in 
migrated sections. 

Time migration is an essential processing step to position observed seismic 
features closer to the geological reality. Several techniques are used for 
migration but all are based on the assumptions that:  

1.Seismic section shows just primary reflections and diffractions; 

2.The interval velocities along the ray-paths are known. Dix formulation 
is used to convert rms velocities into interval velocities: 

=
?
?

 

Where  is the rms velocity and  is the zero-offset arrival time corresponding 
to nth reflector (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). 

In practice, migration aims at solving the angle of incidence ? (see Figure II.22) 
and track the ray path backwards to the reflecting point. The “Huygens’ 
principle” is assumed, in which every point on a wavefront can be regarded as a 
new source. Each reflector is therefore seen as covered with point sources, all 
exploding at t=0 (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995). How this process is achieved 
allows distinguishing the different migration methods: e.g. Kirchhoff; finite-
difference or frequency-wavenumber migrations. 

A finite-difference method is used to reprocess the IAM GB1 MCS profile. This 
method allows to migrate dips up to 60°, produces less migration noise, is 
effective in low signal to noise areas and can accommodate lateral velocity 
variation (Sheriff and Geldart, 1995).

Figure II.21- Migration principles. a) Shows the true geometry of the reflector CD in a depth 
section, B) shows the same reflector in a stacking section (C’D’) and the migrated back into

than the original geological feature (image from Yilmaz, 2001). 

 
Figure II.22- Schematic representation of horizontal and vertical displacement in migrated 
sections. Note that reflector CD, in the unmigrated section, is moved to the C’D’ position after 
migration. Event E and E’ on the unmigrated and migrated section, respectively are used as 
reference for the amount of horizontal and vertical displacement (dt and dx).  

The time migrated profile can be adjusted according to a vertical velocity 
function to obtain a linear in depth section. This depth conversion process 
differs from depth migration, which implies solving ray path in areas of high 
lateral velocity contrasts. Depth conversion is the process selected to obtain 
IAM-GB1 MCS profile in depth. What we obtained is a stretched version of the 
depth migrated profile, this approximation is particularly important in this work 
because it is helpful to relate geological structures with seismic activity. We 
selected this method because although this seismic section is located in the 
transition between different geodynamic domains, lateral velocity gradients are 
low as we will further discuss in chapter IV (and Appendix V).  

II.6. Principles of seismic interpretation 

Rocks are distinguished in seismology by seismic velocity and density. The 
product between density and velocity is the seismic impedance. The primary 
reflections recorded in the seismic trace result from seismic impedance 
contrasts that follow grossly the lithological bending or unconformities. As a 
result the primary reflectors have chronostratigraphic significance. It is worth

boundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia 
 

70 
 

noticing that lateral facies transitions are too gradual to have any imprint at the 
seismic trace. These basic principles allow the correlation of reflectors of 
different areas and the link of the seismic signal with geological record.  

Following the same principles, Mitchum et al., (1977) applied the stratigraphic 
concept of depositional sequence to the interpretation of seismic sections. A 
depositional sequence is “a stratigraphic unit composed of unconformable 
succession of genetically related strata and bounded at its top and base by 
unconformities or their correlated conformities”. This definition is the bases of 
seismic stratigraphy and instructs the seismic interpretation as the study of the 
geometric pattern within a depositional sequence and of the surfaces separating 
it. The limiting boundaries can be: 

? A hiatus defined by the nonexistence of an interval in geological record;  

? An unconformity that is an erosional or a non-depositional surface and it 
marks a hiatus ; 

? A conformity which separates sequences from different ages without 
evidences for a hiatus between it.  

The concept is illustrated at Figure II.23.  Seismic sequence is the depositional 
sequence in a seismic section and is subdivided in seismic units (numbers in 
Figure II.23). Seismic facies are the defining features that allow us to 
discriminate different seismic units. The essential parameters are summed up in 
Figure II.24

therein). Surfaces A and B define the base and the top of a seismic sequence. Both surfaces

III.NEAREST OBS experiment 

In this chapter, we describe the results of the NEAREST seismic network 
experiment for local earthquakes monitoring in the Gulf of Cadiz region. It is 
subdivided in four sections. In the first section III.2, we describe pre-processing 
steps and preliminary results. We start by evaluating events detection and 
compare it with permanent land network data for the acquisition period. Next we 
describe the phase identification in LOBSTER OBS, GEOSTAR and land 
stations and local magnitudes estimation only from the OBS data. Finally, we 
present a preliminary earthquake location. 

In the section III.3, we show the results on improving earthquakes location by 
applying Joint hypocenter determination, simultaneous inversion for hypocenter-
velocity model and double-difference techniques. Fault-plane solutions and 
tensor analysis are described in section III.5 and III.6, respectively. In the last 
section we sum up and discuss the final results. 

III.1. Pre-processing and preliminary results 

III.1.1.Event detection and extraction 

Since the NEAREST network acquired the passive seismic data in continuous, 
we tested two methods for earthquakes detection: spectrogram analysis and 
automatic trigger algorithm (details on both methods in chapter II).  

The spectrogram image was created by using a routine package in FORTRAN 
code provided by Luís Matias. We started off by converting the originally 
waveform in seed format to ASCII using rdseedasc routine. In the next step, we 
used len2bmp application to generate spectrograms bitmaps (Figure III.1). This 
application uses an input file len2bmp.in with several user defined parameters 
(Figure III.2): the number of stations to output (nsta), the number sample points 
to compute the spectra (n_spectra); the instrument sample rate (sranom), the 
number of spectral frequencies to output (nfj), the number of frequencies to be 
averaged (n_sum), the time shift between spectra in s and the attenuation 
factor. Detected events were then extracted from each station waveform files (in 
seed format) using rdmultiseed routine and merged in events waveform files 
using seisei application (from SEISAN 9.0.1 package, Havskov and Ottemöller, 
2011).  

The second method uses an automatic REF-TEK trigger algorithm, STA/LTA 
(short time average/long time average). In this process, earthquakes are 
identified because absolute amplitude variations during these events are 
resolved from the background seismic noise. The effectiveness of this method 
depends mainly on trigger algorithm sensitivity and accuracy, determined by the 
adequacy of the selected trigger parameters (details in Table III.1Table III.2).

We only considered events that were identified simultaneously in more than 4 
stations. An example is presented in Figure III.3 and Figure III.4.

Afterwards, event detection is checked in respective seismograms.

We compared the results from both techniques, for a reference month and 
recognized that 86 % were detected by the two methods. Most events restricted 
to spectrograms had low quality or could not be seen in the seismogram (false 
events). In this context, assuming that automatic REF-TEK trigger algorithm is a 
faster method, triggering it was the method chosen to extract events from the 
continuous data set.

event. Both stations show amplitude changes in during the event indentified in seismic 
spectrogram (fig.III.1). However the seismic event can only be clearly picked at OBS18 
seismogram. 

 

After running the triggering algorithm 1641 events were identified, 1322 of which 
were earthquakes (corresponding to 19% of false positives). To this dataset 32 
events were added, detected only using spectrogram analysis (or detected by 
chance), producing a total 1354 events. 

A quality control of the events was made using the categories defined in the 
Table III.3. As a result we obtained 52 events of best quality, 154 of high, 561 of 
medium and 587 of low. This means that 767 or 57% of the all events should be 
located. During the NEAREST network acquisition period, 422 earthquakes 
were recorded in landstations (data provided by Fernando Carrilho from IPMA-
Instituto Português do Mar e da Atmosfera, former IM-Instituto de Metereologia, 
in NEAREST 2008 Cruise Preliminary Report) for the NEAREST network 
region. This means that the NEAREST Network added 345 to the events 
catalogue in the study area, i.e. these were not detected by the IPMA land 
stations. In contrast, only 58 events were undetected by the NEAREST OBS 
and reported in the land Network catalogue. Those events were located at NE 
of the NEAREST network, near the Algarve coast. In the Figure III.5 we plotted 
Land Network events located to a maximum of 75 km of the closest OBS station 
the region inside the black ellipse marks events not detected or poorly seen by 
NEAREST temporary network.

III.1.2.Phase identification and preliminary location  

The seismic data analysis was carried out using SEISAN 9.0.1 Seismic Analysis 
package (Havskov and Ottemöller, 2011). For general plotting and signal 
analysis it was used the MULPLT program integrated in this package. All the 
events were manually picked for P and S waves’ first arrivals, generally in the 
three components seismometer and in unfiltered signal (Figure III.6 and Figure 
III.7). When necessary band-pass filters were applied to improve signal to noise 
ratio and allow phases identification. One way band–pass filter with low-cut of 
4Hz and high-cut of 25 Hz were applied to identify p-wave first arrival (Figure 



Strain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate 
boundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia 
 

78 
 

III.8) and with low-cut of 2 Hz and high-cut of 4Hz for s-wave picking (Figure 
III.9).  

 
Figure III.6- Event recorded in GEOSTAR and OBS09 vertical component (no filter applied). 

 

 
Figure III.7- Event recorded in GEOSTAR, OBS06 and OBS19 horizontal components (no filter 
applied). 

P-wave first arrival polarities were read in unfiltered signal. In Figure III.10, we 
illustrate how misleading can be the use of filter signal to determine P-wave 
polarities. In this example we see that in unfiltered signal the P-wave first 
motion is up and in filter signal the polarity is reversed. To determine local 
magnitudes (ML), we picked the maximum amplitude of the seismic events in 
Wood-Anderson seismogram of LOBSTER stations’ horizontal components 
(Figure III.11). 

The hydrophone record was used only as alternative for P wave picking (with 
high-pass 1Hz filter when required –Figure III.12) and polarity confirmations. In 
Figure III.12 is shown an example of hydrophone signal (note that polarities are

reversed). P-wave first arrival and polarity were picked on land stations signals 
exclusively to constrain focal mechanism solutions (Figure III.13).

the lower with band-pass filter of 4-25Hz).

Figure III.10- Polarity picked in unfiltered (top) and filtered seismogram (bottom). We can 
recognize that using band pass-filter 4-25 Hz when picking for P-wave polarity can lead to 
wrong measurements. In unfiltered signal the P-wave polarity is clearly up and in filter is down.

Differential weighting was applied to all phases pickings based on reading 
uncertainty. A clear identification of first arrival was classified with weight 0 and 
poorly identified phase with weight 4. This weighting scheme is a fundamental 
pre-processing step to improve events locations solutions. It will define the 
relative quality of arrival time readings when computing earthquakes locations. 
All land stations picks were attributed with weight 4 to be excluded from 
earthquakes locations process. Including land stations locations would imply 
adapting the velocity model to include continental lithosphere variability. This 
processing step was not included in this work. 

A total of 794 seismic events were analysed, 746 of which in more than 3 
stations. A total of 11901 phase picking, 4739 P-wave and 7612 S-wave first 
arrivals. For most stations the number of S-picking was larger than P-picking. In 
fact, some of the recorded events consisted exclusively by, or we could only 
recognize, S-wave arrivals (see appendix I for stations detections details). Apart 
from local earthquakes, teleseismic and regional were identified. These events 
were excluded from this work because we were only concerned with the local 
seismicity. In Figure III.14 is an example of a local earthquake recorded both in 
NEAREST and Land networks.  

Preliminary earthquake location and local magnitude estimation was performed 
using the HYPOCENTER application from SEISAN 9.1 package (Havskov and 
Ottemöller, 2011). This application is a modified version of an early 
homonymous application (Lienert et al., 1986, Lienert, 1991, Lienert and 
Havskov, 1995). The HYPOCENTER uses as input the first arrival phases (P 
and S) and a layered velocity model to determine earthquake location. When 
absolute time in a station is not well constrained it can use relative arrival time 
differences (S-P). Detailed description of the location method is presented in 
Lienert et al. (1986). The interpreter must predefine several input values in a 
parameter file, STATION0.HYP. This file will also contain fundamental location 
parameters: station details and velocity model. 

The velocity model used for preliminary locations was defined in the NEAREST 
2008 Cruise Report R/V Urania. We excluded the velocity model used by IPMA 
(see Figure III.15) for locations based on the permanent network because it is 
defined exclusively for the continental lithospheric domains whereas Gulf of 



Strain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate 
boundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia 
 

82 
 

Cadiz lithospheric domains are more complex (see elsewhere in this work). It 
was based on the velocity models inferred from wide-angle reflection (See 
SIS16 in Figure III.14) and refraction seismic profiles in Gutscher et al. (2002) 
and combining results from multichannel seismic reflection profile (IAM-03 in 
Figure III.14) with wide-angle land station records and gravity modelling in 
Gonzalez et al. (1996). We defined this model as MOD0 (see details in Figure 
III.15). The model is described for P-wave velocities only, the S-wave travel 
times are computed based on a Vp/Vs ratio of 1.75. The first 2 layers on MOD0 
represent upper and lower sediments. The crust is subdivided in two layers 
(upper and lower crust) and the Moho is at 16km in depth. We exclude water 
velocity from the model MOD0 because NEAREST Network stations are 
coupled to the sea floor, so ray paths will not cross the water column. 

For local magnitude (ML) estimation it was used Carrilho and Vales (2009) 
formulation for Portugal and adjacent areas: 

=  + 1.287  +  0.00061 ?  2.147 

A is the amplitude measured in a Wood- Anderson synthetic display (in nm) and 
? is the hypocentral distance (in km). 

P and S phase consistence was tested using Wadati diagram. In this diagram, 
S-P times plot against absolute P-time should define a straight line. Phase 
outliers can easily be identified because will misfit this linear tendency (Figure 
III.16). Outliers can result both from error on the first arrival picking or 
misinterpretation of phases. So, misfit phase pickings were re-checked and re-
tested in Wadati diagram. If required phase weight was adapted. 

The focal depth for each event was established using a systematic search 
approach with application RMSDEP (Figure III.16) from SEISAN 9.1 (Havskov 
and Ottemöller, 2011). The RMSDEP routine uses, for a starting depth solution 
(if no initial location is provided), a value included in STATION0.HYP. To ensure 
that the final solution is not controlled by the user defined initial depths, we 
tested different input values. Finally, we assumed that the best solution was the 
one that best fits the data, retrieving the lowest RMS.  

In Figure III.17, we present a preliminary earthquake location for the events 
acquired by NEAREST network using the method just described. The average 
rms of the time residuals for all 746 events analysed was 0.8s. From those, 590 
events are located in the restricted area of the NEAREST network as defined by 
external envelope of the stations locations. The remaining events are distributed 
outside this area. The seismicity is concentrated between 30 and 60 km in 
depth and local magnitude estimation ranges from 0.9 to 4.8.

Within the NEAREST network area, earthquakes are clearly distributed in three 
clusters:  
1. In the S. Vicente Canyon, where most of the seismicity is concentrated in 

a NE-SW alignment; 
2. In the Gorringe Bank, where earthquakes have an asymmetric 

distribution, clustering in the SW part of this submarine mountain 
(Gettysburg high); 

3. In the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain, where seismicity defines an NW-SE 
elongate alignment. 

In the adjacent region, the seismicity is more diffuse with only a few events 
located in the area of the Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge and to the North of 
this structure. A detailed description and discussion of the seismicity in the 
deployment area will be presented in section III.4 after improving earthquake 
location. We will also compare the results with the locations provided by Land 
permanent network.

Stations statistics were also scrutinized (see Appendix I for details). In Figure 
III.18, we plotted a preliminary events location versus events detected in each 
station. The stations with higher number of records are OBS 08, 17, 05 and 06. 
Except for OBS06, the remaining 3 equipments worked without x component 
during the operation. Both OBS 06 and 08 operated during the entire campaign. 
All stations are positioned near the identified clusters, OBS06 near the São 
Vicente Cluster, where most events are located; OBS05 as well as OBS08 are 
near the Gorringe Bank and the OBS17 in the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain cluster. 

The stations with the worst statistics are OBS15, OBS16 and OBS21. The OBS 
15 operated just for 7 month and stopped because the disk was full. Both 
OBS16 and 21 stopped for the same reason but recorded during 11 months. 
Three reasons can explain the poor events recovery as follows. Firstly, these 
stations are located in limit of deployment area and far from areas with higher 
seismic activity. Secondly, the three OBS were deployed on top of the Gulf of 
Cadiz accretionary wedge (seismic chaotic units in Figure III.19). This structure 
is characterized by high internal deformation and anisotropy which favour 
seismic energy dissipation during seismic waves propagation, resulting in poor 
recovery of the first arrivals. The S-waves signal could also be disturbed by the 
presence of fluids. Thirdly, OBS16 and OBS15 are located in the area of 
Mediterranean Outflow Water circulation that may introduce increasing 
background noise and disturb station-seafloor coupling.

events detected, the highest bar is equivalent to 555 events (OBS08) and lowest represents 60 earthquakes (OBS15). The stations with the worst statistics 
are OBS15, OBS16 and OBS21. Several reasons explain this statistic: stations operation details, stations proximity to predominant seismically active zones, 
station-seafloor coupling conditions controlled by the presence of the Gulf of Cadiz accretionary wedge and/or Mediterranean Outflow Water circulation 
(bathymetry compilation from Zitellini et al., 2009).

Figure III.19- Stations distribution versus the thickness of seismic chaotic units. One of the reasons that may lead for poor seismic records in some of the 
OBS is the presence of the Gulf of Cadiz accretionary wedge at the stations base. This structure is characterized by high internal deformation and anisotropy 
which favour seismic energy dissipation during seismic waves propagation, resulting in poor recovery of the first arrivals. The s-waves signal could also 
disturbed by the presence of fluids (bathymetry compilation from Zitellini et al., 2009).

III.2. Improving earthquake location 

III.2.1.Joint Hypocenter Determination (JHD) 

From the 746 located events based on the Nearest OBS experiment we 
selected a subset of 443 events restricted to the deployment area, i.e. within the 
external envelope of the station locations in the SW Portuguese margin that 
were identified in more than 6 stations. The initial average time residual for this 
selection was 0.76s. To improve earthquake location we began by applying a 
Joint Hypocenter Determination (JHD) method using HYPOCENTER from 
SEISAN 9.1 package (Havskov and Ottemöller, 2011) and PRN2RES 
(application created by Luis Matias to include independent P–wave corrections). 
This method retrieves stations corrections to account for 3D propagation effects 
and geological variability below each station (details on the method in chapter 
II). We used MOD0 velocity model to compute earthquake location but tested 
different Vp/Vs ratios. 

After applying the JHD method we reduced the average time residual to 0.415s 
and find the best Vp/Vs between 1.77-1.78 (Figure III.20). The Vp/Vs is higher 
than the one used in preliminary location. We also ran the Wadati application to 
find the average Vp/Vs ratio for the all events selection and results point out to a 
smaller value-1.72. To compare results from both methods we applied a 
modified version of Wadati routine, the Wadati_sp (created by Luis Matias) 
adapted to extract S-wave and P-wave first arrivals time (Ts and Tp, 
respectively). The results and a linear tendency analysis are plotted in Figure 
III.20.  

From Figure III.20, we observe Vp/Vs retrieved from JHD fits the slope of a 
linear tendency crossing the axis origin in a Ts-Tp plot while Wadati computed 
Vp/Vs ratio defines the slope of a general linear tendency. Final results 
discrepancies outcomes from different approaches to find Vp/Vs. JHD method 
finds the best fitting fixed Vp/Vs to all events locations while Wadati value 
results from the average of individual events computations (excluding any 
Vp/Vs value superior to 1.93 and lower than 1.54). 

However, in marine deployment, which is the case of NEAREST network, the 
presence of top high porosity and water content marine sediments decrease S-
velocity, increasing Vp/Vs ratio (e.g. Crawford and Singh, 2008). Also, we know, 
from refraction and multichannel reflection profiles, that half of the seismic 
network is located above large scale chaotic sequences (Horseshoe 
Gravitational Unit and the Gulf of Cadiz Imbricated Wedge, Table III.4 and 
Figure III.19) which can also decrease seismic velocities. Additionally, we have 
evidences for fluid circulation within the Gulf of Cadiz Imbricated Wedge 
testified by mud volcanoes activity (e.g. Pinheiro et al, 2003, Hensen et al., 
2015, among other). This process will also decrease particularly S-wave 
velocity. So, we would expect to have higher Vp/Vs ratios. This is evidenced

with JHD approach because it results from fitting individual Vp/Vs calculations 
to a Ts –Tp plot but attenuated when computing average Vp/Vs (excluding 
higher Vp/vs ratios), which is the case of the Wadati application.

In Figure III.21, we plotted P-wave stations delays derived from JHD method. 
This corrections result from the difference between calculated arrival time, 
based on the P-velocity model and the picked first arrival. It should reflect local 
velocity deviations (or geological variability) from the general velocity model-
MOD0. However, if we compare stations corrections with values of sediment 
thickness in Table III.4 no clear dependence is established, except that highest 
positive delays (or slower local velocities) are correlated with high sediment 
thickness.

Figure III.21- P-wave stations delays derived from JHD method (blue is positive delay, meaning 
that arrival times in these stations reveal local slower P-velocities when compared with velocity

dependence between stations corrections and sediment thickness in table III.4, except that 
highest positive delays (or slower local velocities) are correlated with high sediment thickness 
(bathymetry from GEBCO). 

Based on the arguments discussed before, we conclude that introducing 
independent S-wave stations delays in the JHD method should be more 
adequate to our case study. We used HYP2 (routine modified Luis Matias to

include S independent delays) and PRN2RES2 applications to improve 
locations, also testing different Vp/Vs. The HYP2 routine defines S-delays as 
additional corrections to be added to the ones computed from P-delays and 
Vp/Vs.  

With JHD method (including independent P and S stations corrections) we 
reduced the average RMS for earthquake location to 0.320s. The best fitting 
Vp/vs is 1.72 (see Figure III.22), equal to the one computed with Wadati routine. 
Once more we plotted Ts against Tp extracted with Wadati_sp application 
(Figure III.22). Equivalent slopes values result from general and forced to axis 
origin linear fits, both similar but smaller than the Vp/Vs derived from JHD and 
Wadati methods.

P-stations delays computed by JHD are plotted in Figure III.23. Once more, 
there is no clear dependency between sediments thickness below stations and 
the observed P-delays. Moreover, with this method GSTAR station results the 
highest negative delay. In Figure III.24, we plotted S-wave additional corrections 
to those computed based on P-delays and Vp/Vs ratio. As we expected, all 
values are positive, reflecting local slower S-velocities when compared with the 
velocity model-MOD0. This velocity reduction is related to subsurface geology- 
top sedimentary layers with high porosity -water content and large seismic 
chaotic sequences (Horseshoe Gravitational Unit and the Gulf of Cadiz 
Accretionary Wedge) with localized fluid circulation, which will decrease S-wave 
velocity.

subsurface geology- top sedimentary layers with high porosity -water content and large seismic

with localized fluid circulation, which will decrease S-wave velocity). 

 

At this stage we were able to reduce average time residuals from 0.425s (JHD 
with P-stations corrections) to 0.320s using JHD method with independent P 
and S stations delays. In Figure III.25, earthquakes locations resulting from this 
method are plotted. It is clear that most events are located between 20 and 50 
km of depth. On a W-E profile we indentify a clear increase of the depth of the 
events from the SW Gorringe Bank (where the lower depth limit is around 
40km) towards the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain (around 50-55 km), marking a step 
like structure defining the seismogenic layer limit in the Gulf of Cadiz region. 
Along a N-S profile, we observe that the events depth limit is located at 50-
55km.

(the black arrows mark the location of W-E and N-S profiles, bathymetry from GEBCO). Most

seismogenic layer limit in the Gulf of Cadiz region. Along N-S profile, we observe that the 
events depth limit is located at 50-55km (Abbreviations: GB-Gorringe Bank, SVC- São Vicente 
Canyon, HAP-Horseshoe Abyssal Plain and AW- Accretionary Wedge) 

One of the main constraints in hypocenter determination is the adequacy of the 
velocity model used by location routines. To introduce this issue we repeated 
the location procedure using different 1D velocities models extracted from 
Sallarès et al. (2011) and Sallarès et al. (2013) NEAREST refraction and wide-
angle reflection seismic profile P2 and P1, respectively, located within the area 
of NEAREST Network (Figure III.26).  

Sallarès et al. (2011) divides profile P2 in three domains: oceanic, transitional 
and continental. Our 1D velocity models were extracted exclusively from the 
first sector, assuming that most of the NEAREST OBS stations are located on 
the oceanic crust domain. This domain is characterized by (Sallarès et al., 
2011): top sediments (comprising Gulf of Cadiz Imbricated Wedge and a thin 
layer of cover sediments) with lower velocities, ranging from 1.8km/s at top and 
3.0 km/s at the base. Underlying these units are higher velocity sediments, vary 
from 2.8 km/s and 4.0 km/s. Crustal velocities below sediments cover vary from 
4.6–4.8 km/s at the top to 6.9–7.1 km/s at the base. Upper mantle velocities are 
low, between 7.6 and .8 km/s, pointing out for some degree of serpentinization 
(Sallarès et al., 2011).  

A total of 3 continuous p-wave velocities models were extracted (see Figure 
III.27A and C) and subsequently converted to average interval velocities profiles 
to be used in HYPOCENTER. Velocity intervals were defined in agreement with 
description presented in Sallarès et al. (2011) meaning that distinct velocity 
layers and sub-layers were respected, to a limit of the available data, roughly 20 
km depth. All velocity models were then extrapolated to approximately 80 km 
depth.  

Mod_P1 was provided by Sara Martinez (pers. communication) and extracted in 
an area coincident to Horseshoe cluster (see Figure III.26 for location). Sallarès 
et al. (2013) description of the P1 profile for the area of the Horseshoe Abyssal 
Plain (where extracted Mod_P1 is located) refers to: a sequence of Mesozoic 
and Cenozoic sediments overlaying directly on serpentinized mantle. The 
transition is marked by strong velocity gradient, increasing from 4km/s to 
7.2km/s, in 3km (see Figure III.27B-C). 

We recalculated earthquakes locations applying the JHD method with 
independent P and S stations delays, testing different velocity models and 
Vp/Vs ratios (between 1.68 and 1.79). After 7 iterations steps, the best fitting 
model was mod_70 extracted from P2 refraction profile with Vp/Vs of 1.71 and 
RMS of 0.317 (see Table III.5). Both mod100 and mod120 had reached similar

boundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia 
 

96 
 

final RMS. The model extracted from NEAREST P1 profile shown the higher 
Vs/Vs ?1.78 and the largest RMS?0.358. 

P and S waves' stations delays, resulting from JHD method with velocity 
mod70, are plotted in Figure III.28 and Figure III.29. For P-wave stations 
corrections no clear relation with subsurface geology is established and once 
more GSTAR had the largest negative delay. However, S-wave stations delays 
still all positive reflecting the effect of the shallower sedimentary layer.  

Final earthquake locations in the deployment area, using JHD method with 
mod70, are plotted in Figure III.30. As in the previous locations, we can identify 
three seismicity clusters: Gorringe Bank cluster, Horseshoe Abyssal Plain 
cluster and São Vicente Canyon cluster. Both in N-S and W-E profiles, we 
observe that most hypocenters are located between 20 and 50 km deep. 
Shallower events are located outside these clusters, mostly to the North of the 
Accretionary Wedge. Within the clusters area, earthquakes depth increases 
from West to East, from the Gorringe cluster to Horseshoe and São Vicente 
clusters.

et al, 2011) with Vp/Vs of 1.71 and a final RMS of 0.317. Three clusters of seismicity are 
identified in the Gorringe Bank, the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain and the São Vicente Canyon 
cluster. 

III.2.2.Determine 1D minimum velocity model 

The arrival time of a seismic wave is a function of both hypocenter location and 
the propagation velocities along the ray path between the focus and the 
recording stations. This dependence is referred as the coupled hypocenter-
velocity problem. For JHD methods the velocity model is fixed and the 
earthquake locations are improved by changes in the hypocenter parameters 
and stations corrections. In the previous section we showed that this approach 
helped to improve earthquakes locations. However, we were able to test only a 
limited range of 1D velocity models variability. In the area of the NEAREST 
OBS network deployment, the crustal structure is variable and so the 
simultaneous inversion for hypocenters and 1D velocity model seems more 
adequate. 

We used the VELEST algorithm, for simultaneous inversion of hypocenter 
location, stations corrections and 1D velocity model for P and S waves (details 
on the method in Kissiling, 1988). As before, stations corrections will account for 
particularly subsurface geological variability below the recording stations and 
additional 1D model complexity can be introduced by consider Vp/Vs ratio 
variable layer by layer. 

The VELEST method is a trial and error process, starting with a priori 1D 
velocity models (based on previous seismological studies, seismic reflection 
and refraction data), initial earthquakes locations and stations corrections. The 
initial model should itself have the lowest root mean square solution. Since in 
most cases the available geophysical data is insufficient, testing a wide range of 
initial velocity models will ensure that we will cover all possible solutions (Husen 
et al., 1999). In the context of the Gulf of Cadiz it is critical to try out several 
hypothetical models because is a region of high lithospheric variability ranging 
from old Jurassic oceanic, transitional to thinned continental (details in chapter 
I). As suggested in Kissling et al. (1994) for areas that comprise distinctly 
tectonic and composition domains we should at least test 3 different velocity 
models (with realistic and also extreme velocity variations). We should also try 
different velocity layering because VELEST inversion process only updates the 
velocity value within layer, maintaining the layer thickness. 

Finally, the best velocity model will yield the smallest misfit (RMS) but must also 
show coherency between of lithospheric structure (particularly subsurface 
geological variability), Vp/Vs ratios and station delays results.

III.2.2.1.Event selection for the inversion process 

One of the main considerations for accurate minimum 1D-velocity determination 
is the initial data quality (Husen et al. 1999). The initial dataset should include 
well located events with observations azimuthal gap lower than 180°and at least 
10 P wave picks (Husen et al. 1999). As input, it is also suggested to use a 
minimum sample of 500 well located events. For the case study we have only 
have 443 events in the deployment area. From those, only a few match the 
desired parameters. So, we will consider less restrictive conditions as 
previously made by Dias (2005) and Carrilho et al. (2004). 

From JHD method tests we defined that mod70 (extracted from P2 NEAREST 
refraction profile) was the best model with lowest root means square misfit 
(0.317s) on locations and a Vp/Vs =1.71. We used this model (including 
stations corrections) to select the events used as input for the minimum 1D 
velocity model determination. Before choosing the events we ran the pharms 
routine (created by Luis Matias) to identify phase mispickings or uncorrected 
weights. Next, we removed all redundant first phase pickings with weight 4 (less 
accurate and excluded from JHD location methods). The VELEST program only 
assumes one picking per phase, so if the first picking has weight 4 and the 
second is 0, it will consider the first. The final selection (details on the data in 
Figure III.31 to Figure III.33) was based on the following criteria: 

1.minimum phase observations set to 10 (Figure III.31); 
2.an azimuthal gap inferior to 210° (average GAP was 112°, Figure 
III.32); 
3.Minimum of 3 p-wave first arrival observation (phase readings are 
dominated by S-wave pickings -Figure III.33. So, it is more important to 
constrain a minimum P-wave picking for events selection). 

The final selection included 269 events with a RMS based on HYP2 and 
PRN2RES2 of 0.281s. The 269 events are distributed in three clusters: 109 are 
located in the area of São Vicente Cluster, 83 in the Gorringe cluster and 52 
events in the Horseshoe cluster (Figure III.34). Most hypocentres are located 
between depths of 20-50 km.

III.2.2.2.Reference station 

The stations corrections in VELEST program are relative, calculated based on a 
reference station. Crosson (1976) points out that stations corrections are just 
additive adjustments to arrival times and will only be distinguished from other 
parameters corrections if they are relative. In this way, stations corrections will 
reflect model departure from lateral homogeneous velocity structure. So, the 
selection of the reference station is critical in hypocenter determination because 
stations corrections are the only way to adjust local tri-dimensional geological 
structure to the estimated 1D velocity model.  

The reference station was selected based on the criteria suggested by Kissling 
et al. (1994): 

1. Considering the continuity of the seismic record (at least 50% of 
the total possible readings);  

2. central location within the seismic network; 

3. the variability of the subsurface geology. 

We selected station 9 (Figure III.34 to Figure III.35 as the reference station 
because: i) it is located in the middle of the seismic network; ii) it recorded most 
of the selected events; iii) it lies on top of the seismic chaotic sequence with a 
thickness is ?770 ms (TWT) that is similar to the average thickness in 
NEAREST network area, around 700 ms (TWT); IV) it has one of the smallest 
station correction estimated by the JHD method.

located between 30 and 50 km deep (the black arrows mark the location of W-E and N-S 
profiles, black triangles mark NEAREST stations and blue triangle NEAREST reference station-
9 see section III.3.2.2, bathymetry from GEBCO). 

 

 
Figure III.35- Distribution of phase readings by seismic stations. Station 9 was selected as 
reference station because it recorded most of seismicity within the NEAREST OBS deployment 
area. Additionally, because it is located in the centre of the NEAREST seismic network and 
subsurface geology below this stations it is similar to geological variability expressed in velocity 
model, i.e. station correction deduced from JHD method is minimum. 

 

III.2.2.3.Processing parameters and sequence 

As suggested in Kissling (1995), defining the minimum 1-D velocity model 
requires multiple runs with VELEST to select and test control parameters 
appropriated to the data set. The final solution will be highly dependent on the 
values attributed to these parameters. A set of VELEST output files help in this 
procedure, providing detailed information about many intermediate calculation 
steps, even within one single iteration step (Kissling, 1995). From these 
intermediate results we can adjust the control parameters to obtain the best 
combination to proceed to the final runs of VELEST. 

The VELEST program works with an input file (velest.cmn in Figure III.36) 
where the main parameters controlling the inversion process are defined. These 
parameters are described in detail in Kissling (1995); we will only refer here 
some critical input values.  

The nsp factor (Figure III.36) controls the use of P and S phase pickings to 
estimate both hypocenter and velocity model. For nsp=1, only the P-wave 
readings are considered. This approach will help to constrain the velocity model 
but will be less effective in establishing hypocentre location. The use of S-
readings will result in a more accurate hypocentre location, especially regarding 
focal depth (Husen et al., 1999). It can be included with fixed Vp/Vs (nsp=3) or

using independent S-readings and stations delays determinations (variable 
Vp/Vs, nsp=2). With the last option the earthquakes location was considerably 
improved.  

We started by checking the best processing order based on these three options. 
The following sequence delivered the best solution. Initially, we started by 
inverting with P-phase readings only (nsp=1) to define the velocity model 
layering and minimize RMS values. We used the outputs as input to the next 
step where we included S-readings and tested the best fitting Vp/Vs ratio only in 
order to define the input models for next step with variable Vp/Vs ratio. In the 
last stage we integrated S-readings (nsp =2) with the best results from the 
previous tests as input. We tested fixed Vp/Vs option but the results delivered a 
much higher RMS than using variable Vp/Vs ratios. Husen et al. (1999) used 
the same procedure and also conclude that it resulted in the best RMS values. 
Additionally, in marine sediments the Vp/Vs ratio decreases significantly in the 
upper subsurface layers with the transition between unconsolidated and 
consolidated sediments (Crawford and Singh, 2008) unfavouring fixed Vp/Vs 
models. In the context of the study area other arguments favour the variable 
ratio approach: 

? The presence of large scale seismic chaotic sequences (Horseshoe 
Gravitational Unit and Gulf of Cadiz Imbricated Wedge) which at least in 
shallow levels should decrease S-wave velocity. Additionally, there are 
evidences for widespread fluid circulation testified by mud volcanoes 
activity (e.g. Pinheiro et al, 2003, Hensen et al., 2015), that should also 
contribute to low S-wave velocities and high Vp/Vs ratios.

profile (Sallarès et al., 2011). Serpentinization process decreases Vs 
velocity, increasing Vp/Vs ratio (Christensen, 2004).

Figure III.36 -Example of the control file for VELEST application. 

Besides using P and S phase readings information, VELEST also allows 
differentiated relative weight between the phases (swtfac). This is an important 
factor because a clear S-wave reading is generally more difficult to identify than 
P-wave first arrival. A misinterpreted S-phase will increase uncertainties 
particularly in hypocentre location. In this study, we attributed the same weight 
for both phases because we already classified the S and P pickings with relative 
weight in preliminary locations. This weighting will be incorporated in VELEST 
process.   

Stations corrections inversion is introduced by nsinv parameter and will 
primarily solve discrepancies between one-dimensional minimum velocity model 
and tri-dimensional subsurface geological variability below receiver stations. 
However, Dias (2005) pointed out that introducing these corrections in the early 
stage could inhibit initial velocity model to adjust to a more accurate velocity 
structure of the study area. We tested both hypotheses and observed that 
without introducing stations corrections in the early stages the models will 
converge faster to common velocity values particularly in the intermediate 
velocity layers.  

The VELEST application limits station locations to the first layer of the velocity 
model, if there is a high discrepancy between stations elevation the inversion 
process can become unstable (Hussen et al., 1999). Since we are working with 
Ocean Bottom Seismometers with 3031m of maximum depth difference 
(OBS01 and OBS16 at 5100 m and 2069m depth, respectively), including 
stations elevations (iuseelev parameter) will decrease this layer thickness and

avoid processing instability. To avoid water and air quakes the minimum 
earthquake depth was set to 5km (zmin). 

For damping factors in hypocenter location (othet, xythet and zthet) velocity 
(vthet) and stations (stathet) corrections we used the same values during the 
processing sequence with 0.01 for hypocenter location and stations corrections, 
1.0 for velocity model, as suggested Kissling et al. (1994). For the velocity 
model, additional independent layer damping control can be included in the 
input velocity model file (input.mod). So, we increased damping factor for the 
top layers preventing unrealistic increase of velocity. Also in order to control 
hypocenter depth and velocity adjustments during the inversion process we can 
vary Zadj and Vadj values, respectively. In the initial running we set the Vadj to 
0.5 and updated to 0.20 in the final steps. The Zadj was set to 5.0 during all 
processing sequence.  

During the velocity inversion process the VELEST algorithm allows for low 
velocity layers (lowveloclay). However, this should be limited to the cases 
where this is clearly indicated by the data (reflection or refraction seismic 
profiles) because it will introduce instabilities (Kissling et al., 1994). We 
excluded low velocity layers in all tests.   

The ittmax and invertratio parameters set the sequence for forward and 
inversion steps. During the processing sequence the invertratio was set to 2 
(except for location steps which excluded inversion process) meaning that every 
second iteration will be an inversion. The iteration number was variable 
depending on the RMS evolution during a specific step.  

The final processing sequence was the following, 

I. Invert for Vp initial model without introducing stations corrections: 

I.1.Invert for Vp initial model: improve location (9it) ? invert for velocities 
(9it 2inv) ? improve location (9it)  

I.2. Defining best layering: merge similar velocity layers 

I.3. Invert for both Vp: improve location (9it) ? invert for velocities (9it 2inv) 
? improve location (9it)  

II. Invert for minimum velocity model introducing stations corrections: 

II.1.  Invert for Vp: improve location (5it) ? invert for velocities (9it 2inv) ? 
invert for stations corrections (9it 2inv) ? invert both velocities and 
stations not allowing low-velocities layers (5it 2inv) 

II.2. Invert for both for minimum Vp and Vs (testing different Vp/Vs as input): 
improve location (5it) ? invert for velocities (9it 2inv) ? invert for 
stations corrections (9it 2inv) ? invert both velocities and stations not 
allowing low-velocities layers (5it 2inv) 

In every processing step, the previous output was used as input.

Invert for minimum Vp model based on P-phase readings (step I in processing 
sequence) 

Initial 1D P-velocity models (step I.1 in processing sequence) 

We started by testing velocity models extracted from available geophysical 
data: MOD0, n70 (mod70) and also some slower (s02 and s03), faster (f03, f04, 
f05) and intermediate velocity (t01, t02) models (Figure III.37 to Figure III.40). 
No initial stations corrections were included as suggested in Kissling (1995). 
With these models we will explore velocity values variations within the different 
layers and evaluate hypocenter distribution for the selected events. From Figure 
III.37 to Figure III.40, we present initial velocity models 1D profiles, events 
distribution by depth intervals in histograms and initial RMS.  

It is worthwhile notice that all initial models have similar velocities in lowermost 
layers. So, we would expect that all velocity models converge rapidly in these 
layers. In Figure III.37 to Figure III.40, we detect that, for all velocity models 
(except for s02), hypocenters density is higher between 30 and 50 km, these 
layers should be the ones where velocity convergence is more successful. For 
velocity models f0, f04, f05, t01, n70 and mod0, we also identified a 
considerable number of earthquakes in the shallower layer. However, velocity 
inversion for topmost and bottom layers was conditioned by the hypocenters 
distributions. These boundary layers generally have lower resolution than the 
central layers where most hypocenters are located and velocity constraints 
resulted from combined information of direct and refracted ray paths. The RMS 
result after relocation (without stations corrections) is higher for intermediate 
velocity model t02-0.721s and lower for the fast model f05- 0.370s.

excluded, 1090-1092 unknowns (4x 269 hypocentral parameters and 14 to 16 
velocity parameters) were to be determined with the inversion problem. 
Because 2622 P-phase pickings were produced the inverse problem is 
overdetermined by a factor of 2.40. 

Before starting the inversion procedure we relocated the events sequence in 
two steps: 

1. With HYP2 application and station0.hyp updated with testing velocity;  

2. With joint hypocenter determination using VELEST application (step 1 in 
processing sequence). 

These steps minimize the impact of input locations in the inversion process. 
After relocation process the RMS values range from 0.3918s (mod0) to 0.3459 
(moderated fast model f03 –Figure III.41). In the next running we inverted only 
for velocity model every second step (with a Vadj=0.5) and the RMS decreased 
below 0.35s. With the final location step the RMS improvement was minimum 
and the resulting values fluctuated between 0.3364s and 0.3258s. 

 

 
Figure III.41-RMS evolution along processing steps (in processing sequence, loc ini and loc fin 
define the initial relocation step, vel ini and vel fin is P- velocity inversion step and final 
relocation run RMS is defined by the last loc ini and loc fin). After initial relocation RMS 
decreases drastically, regardless the initial velocity model. It is clearer for intermediate velocity 
mod_t02. After the first inversion of the P-velocity model, all resulting location have similar 
misfits.  

In Figure III.42 to Figure III.45, initial and final velocity models (with final 
hypocenters depth distribution) are displayed. The first velocity layer increases 
in all models (even with layer damping) and the final value is dependent on the 
input. For slower models (s02 and s03) reaches 3.1 to 3.2 km/s, in intermediate 
models (MOD0, n70, t02)  3.2-3.5 km/s and in fast models (f03, f04,f05) and 
model t01 results in values between 3.5 km/s and 3.7 km/s. After inversion most 
hypocenters are still located between 30 and 55 km in depth. However, the 
number of hypocenters in shallow levels decreased, with more impact for

models t01, n70 and mod0. This general decrease of shallower events is a 
consequence of the increase of P-seismic velocity at the topmost layer. Higher 
velocities will increase events depths.

and deeper (&gt;60km) earthquakes decrease.

model f03, f04 and f05, respectively. Final velocities are faster than in the initial models. There 
is a decrease in events density both on the top and bottom layers. In the intermediate layers 
seismicity is distributed roughly uniformly.

and 0.329, for model t01 and t02, respectively. In these models there is a remarkable decrease 
of earthquakes in the topmost layer. This result is a reflects the increase of the seismic velocity 
on the topmost layer: from 3 and 2.5 km/s to 3.7 and 3.5 km/s, for modt01 and modt02, 
respectively.

profile P2 (black dash is the initial model with no initial stations corrections, red dash is the 
model after inversion and blue bars are the earthquakes depth distribution after inversion). In 
final earthquakes locations RMS are 0.338 and 0.335 for model mod0 and n70, respectively. 
There is a decrease on the number of events located on the topmost layer, concomitant with an 
increase on the P-seismic velocity. Events are redistributed to the intermediate levels (15 and 
30 km in depth) as seismic velocity decreases slightly.  

 

From the velocity models summary shown in Figure III.46, we recognize a 
convergence on the absolute velocities for the layers with higher concentration 
of hypocenters, common to all input model, mostly to 30 to 55km depth. This 
tendency increases for input models with similar velocities, extending to an 
interval 15-70 km depth. For velocity models f03, f04, f05, mod0 and n70, upper 
mantle velocities are defined in the 19km boundary, ranging from 7.46 to 7.80 
km/s. For top layers, mostly crossed by subvertical ray paths, no convergence 
is observed. Also, we would expect based on seismic reflection and refraction 
data in this area, that there is high variability in subsurface geology below the 
recording stations. This variation should be, at least partially, solved with 
stations corrections.

Figure III.46- Initial models with 14 -16 layers and resulting inversion models derived from p-
wave readings. In topmost layers, p-wave velocities increase transversally to all models. In 
these layers, mostly crossed by subvertical ray paths, no convergence is observed is. Absolute 
velocities converge in the layers with higher hypocenters density, mostly to 30 to 55km depth 
(except for models s01 and s02).  

 

Models with 24 layers (step I.1 in processing sequence) 

To test velocity models geometry we converted previous input models to more 
complex structures with 24 layers (Figure III.48 to Figure III.51). For the upper 
layers (until 20km in depth) we included velocity increment every 1 to 2km, in 
the intermediate layers (from 20-40km) a 2 to 3 km thickness and for lower 
layers with 5 to 10 km thickness. 

Since we are using the same sample with 269 events and a velocity layering 
with 24 levels, we will have 1100 unknowns to be determined with the inversion 
problem. We have 2622 P-phase pickings so the inverse problem is 
overdetermined by a factor of 2.38. 

The processing sequence was the same applied in the previous test (Figure 
III.47). After initial relocation RMS values range between 0.3939 for the extreme 
slow s02_m24 and 0.3451 for the fast model f05_m24. After the velocity 
inversion step, the highest RMS value is 0.3836 and the lowest 0.3253. In the 
final step, we relocate the events with inverted velocity models. The RMS 
decreased for most models, ranging from 0.3617 (model f04_m24) to 0.3249 
(model t01_m24). However, during the inversion process models f03_m24, 
f04_m24 and f05_m24 became instable and RMS solution increased.

In Figure III.48 to Figure III.51, we identify a few important modifications on the 
initial velocity model. For all models, significant changes summed up to 
decreasing models variability in terms of geometry, merging velocity layers 
(particularly when velocity increment was smaller). 

 
Figure III.47- RMS evolution along processing steps (in processing sequence, loc ini and loc fin 
define the initial relocation step, vel ini and vel fin is P- velocity inversion step and final 
relocation run RMS is defined by the last loc ini and loc fin). After initial relocation RMS values 
range between 0.394 and 0.345. With velocity inversion, the highest RMS value is 0.3836 and 
the lowest 0.3253. In the final relocation RMS decreased for most models, ranging from 0.3617 
to 0.3249. However, during the inversion process the faster models became instable and RMS 
solution increased significantly.

s02_m24 and s03_m24, respectively. Velocity at the topmost layers increased notably whereas 
the intermediate and bottommost layers remained roughly invariable.

velocity increased considerably and the remaining layers velocities were roughly invariant.

and 0.335 for model mod0_m24 and n70_m24, respectively. The topmost layers velocities 
increase while the other layers velocities remained nearly invariant during the inversion steps. 

In Figure III.52, we observe that convergence in velocity models was more 
successful for depth larger than 25 km. However, from these initial tests, we 
realize that the geometry of the velocity models should be less complex. So, in 
the next steps, we tested models derived from the previous ones but merging 
layers with similar velocity values.

Figure III.52-Initial 24 layers models and resulting inversion models derived from p-wave 
readings. Convergence of the velocity models was more successful for depth larger than 25 km. 
From these initial tests, we realize that the geometry of the velocity models should be less 
complex.   

Models with 11-14 layers (step I.2 and I.3 in processing sequence) 

We converted model mod0 in 11 layers, models s03, t02 in 12 layers, models 
f03, f04, t01, s02 and n70 in 13 layers and finally f05 in to 14 layers. These 
models result from merging layers with similar velocity in P-velocity models 
resulted from step I.1.  

We used the same earthquake selection (269 events), but we reduced the 
number of layers in the velocity model to11-14. In these processing steps, we 
have 1087-1090 unknowns to be determined with the inversion problem. We 
still use only 2622 P-phase pickings so the inverse problem is overdetermined 
by a factor of 2.4 

The processing sequence was the same used in previous inversions and the 
result is shown in Figure III.53. During the inversion step some velocity models 
became unstable: f04_m13, s02_m13 and s03_m12 (fig.III.53). Even though, 
the majority of the starting models reached a smaller RMS values than in the 
previous processing sequence. The lowest RMS is reached with model 
t01_m13 (0.3220) and the highest with s02_m13 (0.3376).  

The hypocentral depths reach similar distribution for models f04_m13, f05_14, 
mod0_11, n70_m13 (Figure III.55 and Figure III.57) where most events are 
located between 30 and 50km and there is a gap on seismic activity around 10 
km. In intermediate velocity models (t01_m13 and t02_m12), this gap is around 
15km (Figure III.56). For slower models (Figure III.54) hypocenter distribution is 



III. NEAREST OBS experiment

concentrated in deeper layers (40-60km). The velocity models s02_m13 and 
s03_m12 remained unchanged except for topmost layers. The most significant 
modifications are observed in models t02_m12 and mod0, in the layers between 
10 and 25 km in depth. 

After the inversion process, the best improvement on velocity convergence is 
reached between 10 and 25 km in depth for all models (expect for slow models 
s02 and s03–Figure III.58). For deeper layers, velocity values remain roughly 
the same. Slowest models converge to common velocities around 43km (?8.2 
km/s). Topmost boundaries remain inconsistent across all models.

Models with 17-22 layers (step I.2 and I.3 in processing sequence) 

Continuing to test geometric variability we converted the 24 layer models to 18-
20 levels by merging similar velocities. We applied the same processing 
sequence. As before during velocity inversion step models mod0_m19, 
n70_m21, f03_m20 and f04_m20 became unstable (Figure III.59). Also, for 
mod0_m19, n70_m21 and all fast models, RMS results are worse than previous 
inversions with 24 layers. For the intermediate velocity models (t01_m19 and 
t02_m17), the final results were better than solutions for 24 layers but similar to 
the ones resulting from less complex models (with 12-13 layers). In fact, only 
slower models reached better RMS results with more complex models, for 
remaining models, 11-14 layers structures are the best solutions. From Figure 
III.60 to Figure III.63, we recognize that besides increasing upper layer velocity, 
models velocities remained almost unchanged.

For the intermediate velocity models (t01_m19 and t02_m17), the final results were better than 
solutions for24 layers but similar to the ones resulting from less complex models (with 12-13 
layers). Inversion step became unstable for mod0_m19, n70_m21, f03_m20 and f04_m20.

All models (except for s02 and s03) start to converge the velocity values at 
?20km depth reaching upper mantle velocities. Slower model s03, converge at 
?33km and s02 at ?40km depth (Figure III.64). However, results with complex 
models are worse than simplified geometries. With 17 to 22 layers convergence 
to a minimum P- velocity model is considerably less effective than the solutions 
with 11 to 14 layers (previous inversion sequence). In fact, if we compare initial 
and final models in Figure III.64, we recognize that velocities diverge from a 
common solution. 

After this extensive testing of layers geometry, we decided to exclude complex 
geometries from the remaining processing sequences. In the next step, we will 
add the inversion for stations corrections using the simplified models from 
previous section (models with 11 to14 layers).

Invert for minimum P velocity with stations corrections (step II.1 in processing 
sequence) 

We used as input the output of models with 11-14 layers section. We forced the 
topmost layer to a more realistic velocity - 3 km/s. Since we included station 
corrections we increased the number of unknowns in the inversion process 
using selected 269 events with 11-14 velocity layers and 25 stations, defining 
1112-1115 unknowns. We still use only 2622 P-phase pickings so the inverse 
problem is overdetermined by a factor of 2.35. 

In the first step, we improve earthquake locations with JHD method using 
VELEST. For next iterations, we inverted for velocity model in a ratio of 2 out of 
9. Improvement on RMS was minimal (Figure III.65). By introducing stations 
inversion, we decreased RMS solution to values between 0.1242s (t01_m13a) 
and 0.1184s (s02_m13a). Finally, we adjusted all parameters by simultaneously 
inverting for best locations, velocity models and stations delays. Final models 
reached similar RMS values ranging from 0.1109s (f04_m13a) and 0.1089s 
(t02_m12a and f03_m13a). The best model combines velocity structure with 
geological constrains and low RMS is n70_m13a. The results of the inversion 
procedure are detailed in Figure III.66 to Figure III.69. A synthesis is presented 
in Figure III.70. 

In Figure III.66 to Figure III.69, the hypocenter distribution shows few shallow 
earthquakes, particularly for models: s02_m13a, s03_m12a, n70_m13a and 
mod0_m11a. Earthquakes density decreases near 18-20km in all models and

between 35 -38km (except to slow models), resulting in a roughly bimodal 
distribution in depth. In slow models hypocenters are distributed between 30 
and 55 km.

activity and increased or remained stable for layers with higher seismic activity. Note that 
although topmost velocity was fixed to 3 km/s it increased slightly to 3.2 km/s.

trimodal distribution in depth defined by the intervals between 5 to 20 km, 20 to 35km and 35 to 
55 km. These intervals were unclear in the same models without adding station corrections 
(Figure III.55). Few changes are observed in the velocity models. Again there is a small 
increase in the velocity of the topmost layer.

and 0.109 for model t01_m13a and t02_m12a, respectively. There is a small increase on the 
velocities of the topmost layer as well as between 10 and 25 km in depth. In the interval 
between 6 and 10 km in depth, seismic velocity decreased slightly. Hypocentres show an 
approximately bimodal distribution.

Figure III.69- Velocity models with 11 -13 layers, black dash is the initial model with initial 
stations corrections, red dash is the model after inversion and blue bars are the earthquakes

mod0_m11a and n70_m13a, respectively. The velocity of the topmost layer as well as between 
?13 and 25km increased in both models.  Hypocentres are distributed mostly between 20 and 
50 km in depth.  Although less clear, we can still see a bimodal distribution of the hypocentres.   

From Figure III.70, we recognize that the final slow models (s02 and s02) 
diverge from a common velocity solution (convergence is only reached below 
43 km in depth). For the remaining models, absolute velocities are nearly 
coincident for the depth interval between ?26 to 70 km. Similar velocities were 
also reached in layers between 10 and 26 km.  

By adding stations delays and forcing the initial velocity for ? 3.0 km/s in all 
models the variability of topmost layer decreased. After inversion, the obtained 
velocity for the topmost layer is ?3.2 km/s in all models. Crustal velocities range 
from 4.91 to 6.39 km/s between 8 and 10 km in depth, increasing to 6.9-7.2 
km/s between 10 and 15 km. Upper mantle velocities are reached at ?16 km 
boundary, with values from 7.4-7.8 km/s.

Figure III.70- Initial 11-14 layers models and resulting inversion models derived from p-wave

(convergence is only reached below 43 km in depth). For the remaining models, absolute 
velocities are nearly coincident for the depth interval between ?26 to 70 km. Similar velocities 
were also reached in layers between 10 and 26 km.  

The best model, that combines velocity structure and variability with geological 
constrains and low RMS is n70_m13a (n70 in Figure III.68 and details in Table 
III.8). Top sediment layers velocities range from 3.2 to 3.8 km/s. Crustal 
velocities start at 8.2 km with 5.5 km/s, set as an average of the remaining 
models. Bottom crustal velocity is 7.2 km/s and extends to 15.9 km. Upper 
mantle velocities are slower than a typical mantle value of ?8.0 km/s, starting at 
15.9 km with 7.65 km/s, increasing to 7.85 km/s at 19km and reaching 8.19 
km/s at 26.1 km. 

Relative stations corrections are described in Table III.6. All corrections are 
referenced to station NR09. Station NR21 correction has the highest positive 
delay. This station is located on top of the Gulf of Cadiz Imbricated Wedge Unit.

Invert for minimum Vp and Vs models with variable Vp/Vs (step II.2 in 
processing sequence) 

The use of S-wave picking increases hypocenters accuracy, particularly 
regarding focal depth. As discussed previously, due to high subsurface 
geological variability a variable Vp/Vs ratio is more adequate than the use of 
fixed Vp/Vs ratios. So, we started by constructing different input S-velocity 
models based on fixed Vp/Vs ratio ranging from 1.68 to 1.76 (Husen et al. 
1999), with increments of 0.01. In each case previous minimum 1D P-velocity 
model with corresponding corrections was taken as reference P-wave velocity 
model. Increased damp was applied to P-velocity model for topmost, crustal-
mantle transition (layers at 15.90 and 19.0 km) and bottom layers to prevent 
unrealistic velocities. 

Since we used P-wave and S-wave picking, we have a total of 6209 
observations. With 269 events, 25 receiver stations and a 13 layers velocity 
models, a number of 1162 unknowns (4x269, 25x2 and 13x2) is to be 
determined with the inversion problem. So, the inverse problem is 
overdetermined by a factor of 5.34. 

The first step in the processing sequence was to relocate the events using the 
new input velocity model. Introducing the velocity model with fixed Vp/ Vs and 
only P-stations corrections was clearly unadjusted to S-wave readings as RMS 
increased to values between 0.9946 and 0.6959. The relocation process 
resulted in insignificant reduction of RMS (Figure III.71). For the following step 



Strain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate 
boundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia 
 

134 
 

we inverted only for stations corrections, introducing independent S-wave 
delays. The RMS solutions decreased to values ranging from 0.2393 to 0.2219. 
In the next running we inverted only for velocity models (with Vadj=0.2), 
resulting in RMS values between 0.2259 and 0.2206. In the last run we inverted 
both for stations corrections and velocity models. Small differences separate the 
final RMS solutions with values ranging from 0.2207 (initial Vp/Vs?1.68) to 
0.2189 (initial Vp/Vs?1.73). A sum up on RMS evolution along the processing 
sequence is presented in Figure III.71. The initial and final models are plotted in 
Figure III.72 to Figure III.73 (initial models with fixed Vp/Vs ranging from 1.68 
and 1.74). 

From Figure III.73, we notice, except for the topmost boundary (with fixed Vp), 
small adjustments in the P-velocity in layers where we have low hypocenters 
density (even for levels with a damping factor of 10). In these layers, we also 
find higher divergence in S-wave velocities. For the remaining levels (?20km to 
?55km) both P-wave and S-wave velocities converge to common values.  

For Vp/Vs ratios, we observe higher values in the topmost layers. This result is 
in conformity with the expected properties for shallow marine sediments. 
Crawford and Singh (2007) describe Vp/Vs ratio variations from values &gt;8 
(unconsolidated sediments) to 2 (consolidated sediments) in the topmost 2km 
beneath the seafloor. Below ?10 km in depth, Vp/Vs ratio becomes more 
consistent for all velocity models, and convergence is achieved for depth 
between ?20 and 55 km.

increased to values between 0.9946 and 0.6959.  Adding stations corrections to both s and p 
waves decreased drastically the models misfit.

Figure III.73- Inverted P-velocity models and S-velocities derived from original fixed Vp/Vs 
ranging from 1.68 to 1.74. The final earthquake location RMS range from 0.2188 for initial Vp/Vs 
of 1.73 and 0.2207 with initial Vp/Vs of 1.68. The P-velocity had small adjustments in layers with 
the lowest hypocenters density (even for levels with a damping factor of 10). In these layers, we 
also find higher variability in S-wave velocities. For the remaining levels (?20km to ?55km) both 
P-wave and S-wave velocities converge to common values.  Note that Vp/Vs ratios are higher 
at the topmost layers as we would expected based on for shallow marine sediments proprieties 
(detail on the text). 

In Figure III.74, we plotted the velocity model with the best RMS solution (initial 
Vp/Vs?1.73). With the new velocity models, including independent S-wave 
velocity, hypocenters are relocated in two distinct intervals: few shallower 
earthquakes ranging from 7 to 10 km in depth and most of the events are 
located between 15 and 50 km (particularly between 30 and 45 km). These two 
intervals are separated by a seismicity gap from 10 to 15 km. Ray statistics 
output for the last iteration step show that the number of hypocenters, the 
number and the length of refracted waves are higher for the layers between 
21.6 and 56.1 km (see Table III.7). So, for these layers both focal depth and 
velocity will have the best resolution.

hypocentres and seismic velocities determinations.

Testing final P and S- minimum velocity models stability 

Following Husen et al. (1999), we tested the stability of the P and S minimum 
velocity models and earthquake locations by perturbing hypocenter locations 
before relocating them with JHD and coupled inversion methods using VELEST 
routine. If the coupled hypocenter-velocity solution is robust, we expected to 
have a minimum shift between resulting and original hypocenters locations and 
also small changes in the velocity model. 

Accordingly, we started by relocate events with the initial velocity model-f05 
(without stations), introducing a random shift in hypocenters locations (Figure 
III.75). The shifts for latitude were between -9.21km and 17.71km, for longitude 
between -12.03 km and 10.05 km and for depth between -30.07km and 
39.76km. After relocating with P and S- minimum velocity models with JHD 
method, hypocenters were returned back to original position with small mean 
shifts in latitude and longitude, -0.08 km and -0.07km, respectively. For focal 
depth final mean shift was higher -0.63km; however, the original mean shift was 
also considerably higher. We repeated the same procedure with the initial 
velocity model s02 (again without stations corrections). Maximum and minimum 
initial shifts were -6.65-16.65 km, -10.05-6.0 km and -33.38 -8.72 km for 
latitude, longitude and depth, respectively (see Figure III.76). Once more, 
relocation with JHD method could locate the events back to the original position 
with small shifts (Figure III.76).

the shift in original earthquakes location after relocation. Note that vertical scale is not the same 
in the left and right graphics). After relocation, hypocenters are roughly at the same position. 
The highest misfit is found in depth.

The highest shift is found in depth relocation. 

Finally, we relocated the events with a systematic shift of 10 km in depth. Fixed 
and damped velocity models are tested. In principle, if we have found a stable 
solution for coupled hypocenter-velocity problem than relocation will be 
achieved by moving the hypocenters back to the original solution or by small 
adjusts in the velocity models or by a combination of both processes (Husen et 
al., 1999). In Figure III.77 the results for inversion with fixed velocity models 
using VELEST application are shown. Events are again relocated back to the 
original hypocenter position with small residual shifts. With damped velocity

models (damp =5) epicenter locations return to the original position (Figure 
III.78) However, depth is retrieved with a ? 1km shift. We find that there is a 
weak dependence between epicenter parameters and focal depth 
determination. Also a small adjustment was applied to the velocity model 
(Figure III.79). The results presented attest the stability of the final minimum P 
and S-velocity models.

events. However, there is roughly any shift in latitude and longitude. We find that there is a 
weak dependence between epicentre parameters and focal depth determination.

III.2.2.5.P and S-minimum velocity models and stations corrections: 
discussion  

The resulting minimum velocity models (Table III.9) reflect the best fit 1D model 
that justifies P and S observations for the investigated 269 events. However, 
since the NEAREST OBS deployment area is described as a region of some 
lithospheric variability (ranging from old Jurassic oceanic, transitional to thinned 
continental and exhumed serpentinized mantle- Sallarès et al., 2011, Gonzalez 
et al., 1996 and Sallarès et al., 2013) these velocity models are hardly related to 
a specific lithospheric structure. On the other hand, stations delays should 
account, at least, for this subsurface geological variability because it will be 
conditioned by their respective position in the deployment area (with respect to 
the selected reference station). Since the station correction for the reference 
station (obs09) is zero, we must assume that the derived 1D velocity model is a 
representation of the average lithosphere structure surrounding that particular 
station. Both P and S stations delays are in agreement with subsurface geology. 
Positive corrections are coincident with higher sediment thickness (in blue 
Figure III.80 and Figure III.81) and negative delays with lower (see Table III.8 
and Figure III.19)

If we compare P-minimum velocity model with the refraction and wide-angle 
reflection data in the Gulf of Cadiz area, we observe that for the upper 
sediments layers the velocities are higher. In Sallarès et al. (2011) velocity 
solutions range from 1.8 to 3.0km/s and 2.8 to 4.0 km/s for the upper and lower

layers, respectively. In our velocity model, in the upper layer Vp is 3.26 km/s 
and in the lower layer Vp is 3.66 km/s. We recall that for earthquakes location 
we replace layers resulting from gradient velocities (refraction data) with interval 
velocities layers. This will explain partially the differences here reported for 
velocities values. Also, we knew that during the derivation of the final models, 
the velocities in these layers were poorly constrained because very few 
hypocenters occur there. This would explain why even when overdamping this 
layer velocity to 3.00 km/s in the final Vp inversion step (step II.1 in processing 
sequence) this velocity increased. The resulting high Vp/Vs ratios are, however, 
in conformity with what is expected for top marine sediments (Crawford and 
Singh, 2007). 

Crustal velocities range from 5.18 km/s to 7.08 km/s in the P-minimum model 
which is only slightly higher than the results from NEAREST refraction profile P2 
(Sallarés et al., 2011) ranging from 4.6–4.8 km/s at the top to 6.9–7.1 km/s at 
the base. The transition between lower crust and upper mantle is ?16km in 
depth. The Moho depth is in conformity with the results published in Sallarès et 
al. (2011). The slow upper mantle velocities are in agreement with Purdy 
(1975), Gonzalez et al. (1996), Sallarés et al. (2011) and Salláres et al. (2013). 
In both Sallarés et al. (2011) and Salláres et al. (2013) these velocities values 
are attributed to mantle serpentinization with characteristic low mantle velocities 
and high Vp/Vs ratios. For the final velocity model these two criteria are 
observed only in the layer between 19.0 -21.6km.  

Final locations with P and S-minimum velocity models 

All events in the deployment area were relocated using the initial JHD method, 
with the adapted HYPOCENTER and PRN2RES2 application (to include 
independent P and S delays). The final velocity model and stations delays that 
resulted from VELEST application were re-converted to the STATION0.HYP file 
using velest_steps routine (developed by Luis Matias). The JHD method was 
run in one iteration step to improve stations corrections. In the final solution, the 
RMS was reduced from 0.317s to 0.275s. From all events, 385 have an error 
inferior to 10 km both in horizontal and vertical locations. The statistics on RMS 
variation for events location is presented on Figure III.82. There is an increase 
of events with the lowest RMS (0.1-0.2).  

For earthquakes locations, the differences are not considerable high. In latitude 
and longitude most events change only 0.01º to 0.02° and in depth only 2 km 
(Figure III.83). If we compare earthquakes depth location between the initial 
velocity model locations with the resulting models from VELEST, we observe 
that there is a decrease on the events located in the top most layers (0 -30km) 
and an increase in the hypocentres located between 30 and 45 km in depth 
(Figure III.84).

From Figure III.84 we observe a bimodal distribution of the earthquake 
distribution were the transition coincident with Moho depth. In the W-E profile 
(Figure III.85), we also identify an area with few events which is limit to the 
uppermost 10 km in the Gorringe Bank area and deep to the E, were this 
interval becomes limit between 15-20 km in depth. In a N-S profile, this 
transition is observed at 15-20km.

In the final earthquakes location we distinguish 3 clusters of seismicity in the 
São Vicente Canyon, in the Gorringe Bank and in the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain. 
On a W-E profile we observe that hypocentres depth increase from the Gorringe 
Bank cluster towards the Accretionary Wedge area. In S-N profile, we recognize 
that most events are located above 50-55 km depth which is considered to be 
the lower limit of seismogenic layer in the area.

Compare with locations by land network 

During NEAREST OBS experiment 291 events were recorded by land 
permanent network in area of the NEAREST OBS stations (data provided by 
Fernando Carrilho from IPMA, former IM, in NEAREST 2008 Cruise Preliminary 
Report), from which 179 events were located by both networks. If we compare 
the epicentre distributions, we observe that most of the land network locations 
are displaced landwards, reflecting the permanent network stations distribution 
(Figure III.86). In latitude and longitude most events locations shift between 0.1º 
to 0.2° whilst in depth this shift varies approximately 20 to 30 km (see Figure 
III.87). 

Concerning depth distributions, we remark that land network locations are 
systematically shallower than NEARST OBS solutions, with maximum 
differences reaching 60 km (Figure III.86 and Figure III.87). Depth alignments 
around 15km and 30km that were clearly seen on land network locations are 
undetected with the NEAREST locations. These alignments are artificial 
constrains on depth locations. This disparity reflects the insufficiency of the land 
station distributions, velocity model and standard procedures to reach more

accurate earthquakes locations in the Gulf of Cadiz area, particularly for low to 
intermediate magnitude events. 

 

 
Figure III.86- Difference between locations derived from Land network (green circles) and from 
NEAREST OBS Network (red circles, the black arrows mark the location of W-E and N-S 
profiles, bathymetry from GEBCO). Epicenters located with the land network are displaced 
towards NE (landwards) and hypocenters are shallower. 

Finally in Figure III.88, we compared local magnitude estimations in NEAREST 
and land permanent networks for the common set of events. Note that the 
formulation used to calculate local magnitude with NEAREST records is the 
same used by routine IPMA network estimations (defined in Carrilho and Vales, 
2009). Except for two events, all NEAREST’ estimated magnitudes are equal or 
higher than the results obtains based exclusively on the land permanent 
networks. For 45% of the estimated magnitudes have differences between 0.2 
and 0.4. These discrepancies result from: 

1. Differences in the stations-event distance between NEAREST and land 
networks. As discussed before, the land permanent network is 
concentrated on the mainland to NE of Gulf of Cadiz main seismic 
activity. For higher source-stations distances, anelastic attenuation 
increases inducing seismic waves to lose energy, diminishing the 
amplitude of the wave. Local magnitude estimations are based on the 
highest amplitude of the wave. To contradict anelastic attenuation, 
magnitude formulations include a distance correction term. Note that if 
amplitude estimations are roughly the same for both networks and land 



III. NEAREST OBS experiment

network locations are systematically biased towards land then distance 
corrections are also lower for land network estimation. As a result 
magnitude would also be underestimated. Accordingly, it could explain 
the magnitude discrepancies between the NEAREST and permanent 
network estimation;     

Other contribution may result from differences in routine procedures for wave 
amplitude measurement. IPMA routine procedures use regularly automatic and 
averaged amplitude measure based on the 3 seismometer components (with a 
correction term for vertical component). While, in NEAREST procedures, 
amplitude was determined manually, always in the horizontal component with 
the highest energy. These differences outcome on higher magnitude estimation 
in NEAREST results.

0. 1 to 0.2° whilst in depth this shift varies approximately 20 to 30 km.

III.2.3.Double-difference re-location  

III.2.3.1.Introduction  

The double-difference methods are useful if applied for a seismicity cluster with 
events closely related where two events are separated by a distance smaller 
than the velocity model resolution and events-station distance. In these 
conditions, it is assumed that geological transitions along ray-path between 
source region and a common station are the same, so any relative travel time 
differences between the two events result only from spatial offset at the 
hypocentres (see section II.4.2 for details on location methods). The double-
difference technique uses any combination of common phase pickings from any 
earthquake catalogues that refers to the differential travel time (catalogue data) 
and/or high precision waveform cross-correlation (cross-correlation data).  

We used the hypoDD program package (Felix Waldhauser, 2001) based on 
double-difference algorithm published in Waldhauser and Ellsworth (2000). Our 
tests are preliminary because it includes only catalogue differences. Cross-
correlation data was tested but few matching sequences were identified. In 
detail, we identified 26 sequences (17 were doubles) in the São Vicente cluster, 
12 sequences (10 doubles) in the Gorringe cluster and in the Horseshoe cluster 
7 sequences (5 doubles). Consequently, these data were only included to 
calculate composite focal mechanisms (see section III.5 for processing steps 
and results). More improvement is necessary to include it in hypoDD re-
location.

III.2.3.2.Processing sequence 

Since this method is restricted to closely related earthquakes, we worked each 
cluster separately. However, hypoDD works with a series of input data 
transversal to all clusters. We started by extracting stations information and the 
velocity model from STATION0.HYP file (SEISAN) with a modified version of 
nsta2dd application (the original is provided in hypoDD package). Since, 
hypoDD only accepts a Vp velocity model (S-velocity is deduced by Vp/Vs ratio) 
we re-located the events with mod0 (for model details see section III.2.2) and 
the final Vp model was deduced with VELEST (Table III.6) with Vp/Vs =1.73. No 
stations corrections were added. In double-difference methods geological 
variability at stations is neglected because equally affects ray-paths between 
closely located events and common stations.  

The seismicity re-location with hypoDD involves a two-steps process. First, we 
need to convert common catalogue files to an optimized combination of 
earthquakes pairs and common stations. We must ensure: i) strong linkage 
between events pairs-common station; ii) establish a net of well connected 
events; iii) minimize redundancy in the dataset. We start by convert phase 
picking files from Nordic to hypoDD format with nor2pha application (by Luis 
Matias). The output files are converted by ph2dt application (provided by 
hypoDD original package) into selected pairs of travel times and then store in a 
dt.ct file.  

The ph2dt application works with an input file (ph2dt.inp- an example in 
Appendix II) with user defined criteria (see hypoDD manual for details). We 
want to define a network of links between the events within our cluster. Because 
we have few events, we use less constricted values in our variables. We used 
large distances to define the maximum distance in km connecting event pair – 
stations (MAXDIST- see hypoDD manual for variables details) and between 
hypocenters (MAXSEP), so that we could include the highest number of events. 
Since, we are re-locating each cluster independently we avoid pairing 
completely unrelated events. Also, as suggested in hypoDD manual for small 
catalogues, we set the minimum of observations (MINOBS) per pair to be 1 
station and maximum (MAXOBS) to the number of station in the network. We 
set this MINLINK (minimum number of phase pairs to define a strong 
neighboring) to be 3, lower than the default (8) so that we could maximize the 
number of included events.  

The second step is to determine double-difference hypocentres locations using 
hypoDD application. Several variables were defined in an input file-hypoDD.inp 
(an example in Appendix II) that can change for a different set of iterations. Our 
aim is to define a strong network of linked events within the same cluster. 
Because we are considering for each case a single cluster (OBSCT=0) than the 
network connectivity is controlled by the maximum hypocentral separation 
allowed between linked events controlled by WDCT (maximum events

boundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia 
 

154 
 

separation for catalogue data). This variable is the same as MAXSEP for 
ph2dt.inp. As suggested by the author Waldhauser (2011) we set a larger 
distance for MAXSEP and constricted our data in WDCT. At first iteration steps 
we decided to maintain the values less constrictive. We defined WDCT to be -9, 
meaning that no event outlier is excluded in the initial 8 iterations. In the next 
iterations, we define WDCT as 20km. We used only catalogue data, with P and 
S waves’ readings and we defined the least square solution to find the best 
fitting hypocentral locations (see more detail on the method in chapter II.4.2 
Appendix II in the input data).  

The hypoDD application runs retrieves several output files:  

1. hypoDD.loc and hypoDD.reloc with initial and final location (including 
initial and final errors); 

2. hypoDD.sta with stations residuals. It only includes final stations 
information, excluded stations are absent; 

3. hypoDD.log with the details on critical parameters that reflects the 
performance of each iteration steps.  

These files help stabilising new input values for future tests.  

III.2.3.3.Results  

In the next subsection we compare plots of the hypoDD.loc and .reloc in map 
and sections. Then we convert hypoDD.reloc into a Nordic file using hdd2nor 
application and compare VELEST with hypoDD results. These steps are 
repeated for each cluster.  

In general, the RMS for final re-locations were considerably improved from 
initial solutions both with MOD0 and VELEST final Vp model (see details on 
Table III.10). In fact, final locations have similar average errors independently 
from the initial velocity. We present only the detailed results from hypoDD tests 
starting with VELEST final Vp model because these tests were compatible with 
a larger number of events. Accordingly, we only compare the latter locations, for 
each cluster, with VELEST results.  

In Figure III.89 to Figure III.91 we show the results of hypoDD re-locations in 
map view and in two perpendicular profiles for each cluster. Because this 
application only allows a 1D-Velocity model and no stations corrections, our 
starting locations have high misfit (see also Table III.10). Accordingly, vertical 
misfit is considerable higher than horizontal because depth determination is 
more susceptible to subsurface geological variability that is minimized by 
stations corrections.  

In the final results, the average misfit decreases significantly for the events 
located within the seismicity clusters. For the double-difference location 
methods improvement depends on events links. Since the events within the 



III. NEAREST OBS experiment 
 

155 
 

centre of the cluster have more links their respective hypocentre determinations 
are more accurate. Accordingly, isolated events that exceed the maximum 
events separation for catalogue data are excluded from final location (set as 
&gt;20km). In the Horseshoe and São Vicente clusters few events were excluded 
(4 in 244). In the Gorringe cluster 14 in 142 events were excluded (Figure III.89-
Figure III.91 and Table III.10).

Decrease is less successful for events located in the clusters limits. That is particularly clear in

effective for events with more links, located in the cluster´s centre.  

We now compare events locations with hypoDD and VELEST in Figure III.92 to 
Figure III.100. In map view both methods show similar locations. However, in 
depth profiles we observe considerable differences. For both Gorringe and 
Horseshoe clusters seismicity becomes shallower with hypoDD method. In 
general most hypocenters are located at depth &gt;20km yet hypoDD re-locations 
result in a larger number of events shallower than 20km (see Figures III.93-94 
and III.96-97). In the São Vicente cluster, the depth distribution is roughly the 
same but hypocenters re-locations with hypoDD collapse, revealing or clarifying 
some possible alignments (see Figures III.99-100).  

With hypoDD method, we would expect to have hypocenters re-located into a 
less diffuse distribution. However, this is only clearly achieved for the São 
Vicente Cluster that is originally more discrete or less diffuse if compared with

the remaining clusters. We recognize that with the introduction of waveform 
cross-correlation data and redefining some initial variables will improve our 
results.

III.3. Focal mechanism solutions  

III.3.1.Introduction  

The SEISAN 9.1 package (Havskov and Ottemöller, 2011) includes several 
programs to determine the fault plane solutions (details on the methods in 
chapter II). In this work we used FPFIT (Reasenberg and Oppenheimer, 1985) 
and FOCMEC (Snoke et al., 1984). Both programs use first motions polarities 
and a grid search to define the source model. FOCMEC can also include 
amplitude ratios of P and S waves, which will help select or confirm the best 
solution. In our case we used only P-wave first motion polarities to determine 
focal mechanism solutions for the local seismicity.  

The FOCMEC performs a grid search to find how many polarities fit each 
possible solution. All solutions are plotted within a limit of possible wrong 
polarities (Figure III.101). The preferred solution is then selected by the user. 
The maximum allowed polarities misfits are defined iteratively. In this work we 
display only the best solutions with minimum misfits (defined by -1). FOCMEC 
allows the user to select the degree of increment for the grid search, 
accordingly, we limited our value to 5 degrees for the majority of the solutions 
and only for less constrained solutions we used 8 degree search. 

 
Figure III.101- Example of possible fault plane solutions plotted from FOCMEC program. 

The FPFIT performs a two stage grid search to find the best fitting fault plane 
solutions. In the initial inversion a 20° increment was used to define the limits of 
strike, dip and rake minimum misfit. In the next stage a refined grid search with 
5° variations around the best solutions found in the first stage was used. One 
advantage of using FPFIT is that the best fitting solutions are estimated based 



III. NEAREST OBS experiment 
 

163 
 

on error statistics while, in contrast, with FOCMEC the best solution is selected

We started by selecting events with at least 10 P-polarities readings as the 
minimum limit considered for fault source estimation. To constrain focal 
mechanism solutions, we also included P-wave polarities readings in the land 
stations.  

To define the focal mechanism solutions several steps were taken: 

1. We started by relocate the events with the minimum P and S velocity 
model; 

2. In the next step, we ran FOCMEC application to define a preliminary 
source solution; 

3. The final source solution is estimated using FPFIT program; 

4. Both solutions are automatically saved to events individual file. We had a 
quality classification and flag the final solution (to prevent from overwrite 
stored solution by attending new estimations). The quality is defined 
based on the suggestion on FPFIT manual (Reasenberg and 
Oppenheimer, 1985) and is described in Table III.11. An additional class 
was added for focal plane solutions unconstrained with FOCMEC; 

5. The data computed by FOCMEC (focmec.dat-with events polarities, 
focmec.out-with fault plane solutions) and from FPFIT (fpfit.fps-with final 
FPFIT solution) are converted to GMT format with faz_mecan.bat script 
and plotted using plo_mecan.bat GMT script (both from Luis Matias); 

6. Since the seismicity is distributed in 3 main clusters, we selected the final 
solutions for each area based on quality criteria and computed composite 
focal mechanism, using both FOCMEC and FPFIT; 

7. We also used sequence analysis to identify similar events in each cluster 
and afterwards compute composite focal mechanisms (see III.4.2.1 for 
processing details).

III.3.2.1.Sequence analysis and composite focal mechanism solutions  

In order to identify the possible sequences we must cross-correlate waveforms 
from the same component. Hence, we started by extracting from original 
waveforms files separated waveforms for each component and station using 
wavnstap code. The code uses the first arrival stored in events individual files to 
select the portion of the waveform that should be extracted. This information is 
set up in an input file along with other controlling parameters: station name, 
component, phase to be selected and the start – end time of extraction (e.g. 5s 
before and 10s after phase picking). The outputs for each selected station 
component are the waveforms and three text files: e.g. NRT01Z.log; 
NRT01Z.out and NRT01Z.lis. Both .log and .out describes operation steps while 
.lis is a list of the extracted waveforms. 

The cross-correlation is performed by the application multcorr using an input file 
to define several controlling parameters, like the following example: 

 

multicorr.inp 

# Total of samples to use. 50% will be tapered. 

512 

# index of the center of window and offset (positive to the left) 

500    50  

# Low and High frequencies of filter 

2.    10. 

# lag to be computed (y/n)? 

y 

# c_tol 

10. 

 

Where the total of samples is defined in a power of 2 because it was used Fast 
Fourier Transforms to compute correlations. The time window is set based on a 
sample rate of 100 Hz. Accordingly, index of offset set to 50 indicated that the 
window starts 0.5s before the phase picking and the time window is centred at 
5s. Before cross-correlation both waveforms are filtered by a band-pass 
Butterworth filter. The c_col allows negative correlation for values below 1. 

The outputs are two files: 

i. stationX.mat file ( where X defines the component Z, Y, X) with the 
information of the correlation, the time –lag between waveforms and also 
the signal-noise ratio average between a master and a slave event; 



III. NEAREST OBS experiment 
 

165 
 

ii. stationX.lis with the waveforms to be compared. 

The sequence determination uses the matrix-sup application that combines all 
correlation matrixes computed above and outputs a list of sequences. It uses a 
parameter file that establishes the correlation limits to define a sequence, 
matrix-sup.inp, an example as follow: 

 

matrix-sup.inp 

# c_min minimum value for a sequence to be declared 

0.7 

# sn_min minimum s/n for a correlation to be accepted 

1.5 

# sn_max saturation s/n. All values above will be truncated 

10. 

# p_pow power to be applied to s/n to obtain the weigth (0 no weight) 

0.7 

 

Where c_min is minimum correlation, sn_minimum is signal to noise minimum, 
sn_max is signal to noise maximum and p_power is power value to determine 
s/n weigth. The outputs are files with lists of the events associated with each 
sequence. After determining all sequences, we evaluated the initial locations for 
each sequence and excluded the ones with events distantly related. We used 
the VELEST velocity model for the initial location. In the next step we improved 
sequence location by adapting station correction to each dataset. Finally, we 
computed composite focal mechanism solution for each sequence. 

III.3.3.Results 

The final focal mechanism solutions based on FPFIT estimations are displayed 
in Figure III.102. We could estimate 124 fault plane solutions, 68 % of those 
with A or B quality (a total of 82 events plotted in Figure III.103). The details on 
the solutions are on Appendix III and related individual plots are in Appendix IV.

In Geissler et al. (2010), 31 focal mechanisms computed with FOCMEC routine 
(and additionally the MECSEI algorithm), also using the P- wave first arrives 
polarities in OBS and Portuguese land stations were reported. These solutions 
were constrained using at least 8 polarities. With the final results of NEAREST 
OBS experiment, we added 58 new solutions, with A and B quality, to the 
previous catalogue. Because we consider events with at least 10 polarities, two 
events from Geissler et al. (2010) catalogue are not included in our work 
(events 5th and 21st of March 2008, with 9 polarities, in southern cluster at figure 
3 of the referenced work). Also, 3 events solutions were classified with C quality 
(the 22nd of May 2008 at the southern cluster and outside the clusters area, both 
the 6th and the 7th of November 2007, ibid.).  

From the A and B quality solutions, 39 % are located in São Vicente, 25% at 
Horseshoe and 17% at Gorringe clusters. The remaining events (17%) are 
located outside these clusters, mostly in the SW continental margin and below 
the Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge. These results reflect the following 
limitations of both NEAREST and Land networks coverage: 

? The Gorringe cluster is displaced from land network distribution and at 
the edge of the NEAREST network; 

? Outside the clusters, the events are located mostly out of the NEAREST 
network boundary or in the vicinity of poor recording stations (inhibited by 
the presence of the accretionary wedge - see III.3.2 for details) 

? The Horseshoe cluster is well constrained by NEAREST network; 

? The São Vicente Cluster, the area with higher seismic activity in the 
NEAREST deployment area, is covered both by NEAREST and land 
stations networks. 

The diversity of the fault plane solutions identified, ranging from reverse dip-slip 
to strike-slip and even normal dip-slip, reflects the complexity of the source 
mechanisms to this low to intermediate magnitude seismicity (see Figure 
III.103). These results are also valid if we inspect each cluster individually (see 
Figure III.104 to Figure III.109).  

In the Gorringe cluster, 31 focal mechanisms were computed, 15 of those with 
A and B quality (see Figure III.104). These new solutions considerably update 
the previous catalogues for this area where only a few focal mechanism 
solutions were known (e.g. Grimison and Chen, 1986; Burfon et al., 2004 and 
Stich et al, 2010).  

The prevailing focal mechanisms are oblique (combinig strike-slip with a reverse 
slip) and reverse dip-slip. In fact, if we combine all polarities observations to 
define a composite focal mechanism, we obtain the oblique solution shown in 
Figure III.105. However, this solution is poorly constrained and has several 
incompatible polarities. We inspected the focal mechanism distribution in depth

based on two perpendicular profiles (Figure III.104), both cross-sections show 
an unclear relation between depth and a particular type of fault solutions. It is 
worthwhile noting the existence of normal dip-slip focal mechanisms at ? 30km 
in depth. In addition, from the two events sequences determined based on 
waveform cross-correlation resulted two composite focal mechanisms (see 
Table III.12 for details and Figure III.116 for solutions and polarities 
distributions), i) one with normal dip-slip solution also located at ?40 km in depth 
(see SEQ08 in Table III.12 and Figure III.106 and Figure III.107), ii) whereas the 
sequence SEQ01 has a pure-strike slip solution (see Table III.12 and Figure 
III.106-Figure III.107) and is located in the transition between two different 
domains that will be discussed in the chapter IV. In opposition to sequence 
SEQ08 where several polarities are incompatible with the focal mechanism 
solution, SEQ01 composite solution is well constrained with only two 
unmatched polarities.

unclear relation between depth and a particular type of fault solutions.

and relation with geological structures will be presented in chapter IV. SEQ08 shows a roughly 
normal dip-slip solution. However, there are some incompatible polarities.

(profile location is in map view-dashed line, circles with different colours separate events from

mechanism is located in the transition between Gettysberg and Ormonde seamounts. Detailed 
discussion on the SEQ01 location and relation with geological structures will be presented in 
chapter IV. SEQ08 defines a roughly normal dip-slip solution and is located at ?35km in depth.  

In the Horseshoe cluster 26 fault plane solutions were found with 10 events 
common to Geissler et al. (2010). From these, all events show similar solutions 
except for the 23rd February and the 5th May 2008 event (Figure III.108) for 
which the computed fault mechanism solution is considerably different from 
Geissler et al. (2010, in figure 3) possibly resulting from the use of different 
methods and/or data. In the first case, we added new polarities the fault plane 
solution (see Figure III.108). For the 5th May 2008 event, even though the same 
number of polarities was used we recovered different solutions. Discrepancies 
result from polarities re-distribution in the focal sphere with event location based 
on a different velocity model. This should be particularly critical for FPFIT 
solution since FOCMEC results match Geissler et al. (2010) solution. A moment 
tensor solution was also computed in Stich et al. (2010, figure 4). In this case, 
differences result from both method and data. The moment tensor solution was

computed based on signals recorded at seismic broadband stations from land 
networks in Portugal, Spain and Morocco.  

 

 
Figure III.108- 23th February and 5th May 2008 event fault mechanism solutions. Note that black 
line is FPFIT, blue line is FOCMEC, red line is MECSEI90 from Geissler et al., 2010 and orange 
line is the moment tensor in Stich et al., 2010. Discrepancies between focal mechanism 
solutions in our work and the ones in previous studies result mostly from using different 
methodologies and a datasets (in our work we added new polarities).  

In general, the focal mechanisms in the Horseshoe cluster show mostly strike-
slip solutions, particularly to the East (see profile P2 and map view in Figure 
III.109). To the west, focal mechanism show a more mixed pattern with 
solutions ranging between reverse to strike –slip kinematics, with a variety of 
combined oblique solutions. Normal dip-slip mechanisms at depth &gt;40km were 
also obtained (Figure III.109). Similar solutions were already revealed by Stich 
et al. (2005, 2010) and Geissler et al. (2010). However, a plausible source 
mechanism was not proposed. 

Composite focal mechanism for A and B quality events show solutions similar to 
general results: pure strike–slip and reverse mechanism with a slight strike-slip 
component, respectively (see Figure III.110). Yet, again, several polarities are 
incompatible with computed focal mechanisms. More reliable composite 
solutions resulted from sequence analysis. In table III.13 we sum up the details 
on the sequences resulted from cross-correlation analysis with events closely 
located.  

The focal mechanism for sequence SEQ03 combines 3 events with 63 
polarities. It shows a reverse solution with a minor strike-slip solution (see 
Figure III.111 to Figure III.112). This mechanism is similar to the 7th of May 
2008 ML 3.9 earthquake recorded in the NEAREST network (see event 53 in 
Figure III.109) and 28th February 1969 earthquake with Ms 7.9 (see Figure I.13). 
However, both events are located ? 20km deep while this sequence is at ? 40 
km in depth and further to East.

roughly pure strike-slip while to NW events show a more complex pattern. Note that few normal 
dip-slip solutions are located at ?5okm in depth. The meaning of these location will be debated 
in the next chapter.

Composite focal mechanism show solutions similar to general results: pure strike–slip and

The sequences SEQ05 and SEQ06 are doubles with 26 and 38 polarities, 
respectively (see Table III.13, Figure III.111 and  Figure III.112). Sequence 
SEQ06 shows a pure strike-slip mechanism while SEQ05 resulted in a strike-
slip with a slight normal dip-slip component. How an extensional fault 
mechanism is generated at ?40km in depth is unclear, as expressed early.

(profile location is in map view-dashed line, circles with different colors separate events from

the focal mechanism for SEQ03 is similar to the 7th of May 2008 ML 3.9 earthquake recorded in 
the NEAREST network and 28th February 1969 earthquake with Ms 7.9. Yet, both events are 
located at ?20km in depth while SEQ03 is located at ?40km and further to theEast. SEQ05 
shows a peculiar location since is a normal-dip slip mechanism at 40km in depth. SEQ06 
defines pure-strike slip solution that is similar with several individual solutions retrieved from 
NEAREST network for earthquakes located in the area.  

We identified 33 focal mechanism solutions in the São Vicente Cluster adding 
17 new events to the previous dataset. Once more, we recognized some 
discrepancies with previous works. Two examples are shown in Figure III.113. 
In both cases our solutions are different from Geissler et al. (2010) mostly 
because we added new polarities to preliminary solutions. In the 20071125A 
event, we also re-interpreted some first arrivals with opposite polarities.

both cases our solutions are different from Geissler et al. (2010) mostly because we added new 
polarities to preliminary solutions. 

The São Vicente cluster is where most events occurred during the NEAREST 
experiment. Dominant focal mechanisms are strike-slip and reverse dip-slip. 
However there are several earthquakes with oblique solutions, mostly 
combining pure –strike slip with reverse dip-slip component. An example is the 
11th January 2008 earthquake with ML=4.8, the highest magnitude recorded 
during NEAREST experiment (see event 78 in Figure III.114 and details at 
Appendix IV.c). This focal mechanism is similar to the one defined to the 17th 
December 2009 earthquake, with local magnitude 6.0. Both events are located 
in the same area and at the depth range ?35-40km. It is noteworthy that once 
more we have extensional events located at depth ?20-40km (see Figure 
III.114). 

Composite focal mechanism based on A and B quality events have similar 
solutions nearly pure-strike-slip kinematics (see Figure III.115). Contrasting is 
the diversity of fault plane solutions derived from identified sequences (see 
Table III.14 for details and Figure III.116-Figure III.117): 

? Both sequences SEQ02 and SEQ10 have reverse dip-slip solutions with 
slightly horizontal component;

? Sequence SEQ05 and SEQ08 have similar focal mechanisms (strike-
slip) and depth but separated by  ?50km;  

? Sequence SEQ15 show roughly strike-slip solutions but striking in 
different direction than SEQ05 and SEQ08; 

? The sequence SEQ09 have reverse dip-slip kinematics with a very low 
angle plane  at ?20 km or contrastingly a sub-vertical plane; 

Sequence SEQ11 is located at ?40km in depth and shows normal dip-slip 
kinematics.

and reverse dip-slip. However there are several earthquakes with oblique solutions, mostly 
combining pure –strike slip with reverse dip-slip component. An example is the 11th January 
2008 earthquake with ML=4.8, the highest magnitude recorded during NEAREST experiment 
(event number 78). This focal mechanism is similar to the one defined to the 17th December 
2009 earthquake, with local magnitude 6.0.

incompatible polarities.

between a type of focal mechanism with a particular area in the map view or in depth.   

 

Finally, we present the fault plane solutions in the area of the Gulf of Cadiz 
Accretionary Wedge. It is important to note that this area is in the eastern limit 
of the NEAREST OBS network (see Figure III.118) thus the events locations 
and source mechanism are less accurate. Nevertheless, we computed 13 focal 
mechanism solutions, mostly reverse dip-slip and pure-strike-slip. Normal dip-
slip focal mechanisms located at depth &gt; 40km were also obtained.

Portimão bank area (green circles are pure strike-slip, red are reverse, blue are normal and

slip solutions are obtained sub-parallel to the accretionary wedge striking direction. Again it is 
worth notice a normal dip-slip focal mechanism solution at 40 km in depth.   

The final results are in agreement with the preliminary solutions published by 
Geissler et al. (2010) based on the best events reported from the NEAREST 
experiment. Additionally, these results are also in conformity with previous 
studies for this area (Grimison and Chen, 1986; Buforn et al., 2004; Stich et al., 
2010). Normal dip-slip solutions were also identified in the upper mantle, as it 
was already reported by Stich et al (2010) and Geissler et al. (2010).  

Both individual focal mechanisms and composite solutions within the three 
seismicity clusters indicate that seismicity results from the combination of 
different deformation processes. The compressive SHmax resulting from most 
of the solutions is in agreement with the transpressive plate kinematics reported 
by several authors between Iberia and northwest Africa; however, the normal 
fault solutions located in the mantle require an alternative explanation.

III.4. Tensor analysis 

III.4.1.Introduction 

We used the Focal Mechanism Stress Inversion (FMSI) package to define the 
stress tensor of the studied area based on focal mechanism data. This program 
uses a grid search inversion technique to find the best fitting regional stress 
tensor, a method described in Gephart and Forsyth (1984). The process implies 
a simultaneous adjusts of individual fault plane solutions and the principal stress 
directions. The best stress model imposes the smallest rotation on fault plane 
solutions to consistently combine stress orientations with fault slip direction and 
sense (more details on the method in chapter II). 

III.4.2.Processing sequence 

The FMSI package was changed by Luis Matias to simplify processing 
sequence. So, the following steps were taken:  

1. Since seismicity is distributed in three areas, we subdivided the FMSI 
analysis accordingly. The input data results from the conversion from 
GMT plotting .mec format to FMSI format .inp using dataset application. 
The data weight could be attributed from estimated magnitude; 

2. A preliminary evaluation of the P and T data were established with a 
modified version of the PTplot application. This program uses also GMT 
plotting files format to plot a lower hemisphere equal area stereographic 
projection of the P and T axis derived from focal mechanism solution. 
This projection helps to identify the variability of the initial data; 

3. The inversion for the stress tensor was reached using a modified version 
of the fmsilm application. This version uses an input file fmsi.in with the 
parameters for the inversion. In this input file the user defines the initial 
maximum and minimum stress axis directions (?1 and ?3). The fmsilm 
application performs a three steps grid search of the best fitting stress 
model. In the first inversion, a coarse GRID search is defined with 10 
degree spacing around a predefined ?1 (maximum stress) and ?3 
(minimum stress) directions, an angular variation and principal stress 
relative magnitude (R= (?2- ?1)/ (?3- ?1)). The subsequent inversion 
steps uses grid searching of 5 and 2 degrees. The initial stress directions 
were defined by previous inversion solutions. In the input model one of 
the following methods for inversion process has to be defined: exact, 
approximate or pole rotation methods. We used the exact method which 
finds the minimum rotation about any axis of general orientation which is 
need to match the observed fault plane/slip directions with one consistent 
with a given stress model (Gephart and Forsyth, 1984). The output files 
are a .out file with the tested stress directions and misfit residual and a 



III. NEAREST OBS experiment 
 

183 
 

.fmsi file with the best fitting stress model residuals, ?1 and ?3 directions 
and the relative stress magnitude estimation (R). 

4. To evaluate the best stress tensor model we used Plo-s1.bat script which 
plots a stereonet with the contour residuals and the points used to 
constrain this contours lines.  

5. Additionally, we checked fault plane solutions consistency with the best 
stress tensor using fmsietab. This application delivers an output file with 
the misfit rotations of each fault observation (for principal and auxiliary 
planes) and a given stress model computed based on the exact method. 
Planes with resulting low shear stress are marked with *. Another 
consistency criterion is unambiguity of the preferred fault plane selection. 
The difference between the rotation misfit of both planes (principal and 
auxiliary) should be &gt; 10° so that we can clearly define the principal fault 
plane solution. The preferred fault plane should also have a misfit lower 
than 20°. This is automatically inspected with bestslip application 
(developed by Luis Matias). 

6. Finally, we rechecked fault planes fit with the regional stress model in a 
Mohr’s diagram. This allows the visual inspection of the consistence of a 
combination of fault planes with reasonable criteria of failure. Slip is most 
likely on planes with high shear stress and low normal stress (Gephart 
and Forsyth, 1984). 

7. If the combination of fault plane solution and regional stress tensor 
resulted in a large misfit we repeated the processing steps with a new set 
of focal mechanism selection. This procedure was repeated until we 
meet a reasonable misfit.  

III.4.3.Results 

We started by testing the inversion process with a compilation of the best focal 
mechanism solution of each cluster and using local magnitude as weighting 
parameter. In all cases, for the same events selection, the average rotation 
misfit was higher with weighted data. As an example, in the Gorringe cluster the 
same dataset had a tensor solution with an average degree misfit of 8.26 and 
7.95, with and without magnitude weighting, respectively. This can result from 
the heterogeneity of focal mechanism solutions in this micro-seismicity setting 
as discussed elsewhere in this work. Accordingly, we excluded weighting from 
subsequence tests. The main results are presented next. 

Gorringe Bank cluster 

The FMSI inversion is a trial and error process that can be improved by testing 
different datasets. In the first step, we included all the best focal mechanism 
solution (see Figure III.119) and subsequently improved the dataset by 
excluding events that were inconsistent with the best tensor solution. We

started with 16 events and an average error of 7.95° and concluded with 14 
events and 4.40°. The details on the dataset are summed up in table III.15 
(dataset all_AB).  

We plotted P-T axis for all_AB dataset and resulting ?1 in a stereographic equal 
area lower hemisphere projection (Figure III.120). The resulting ?1 is in 
agreement with SHmax striking direction, roughly NW-SE, previously published 
data for the area (Grimison and Chen, 1986, Ribeiro et al, 1996, Stich et al, 
2003, Carrilho et al, 2004). Finally, we recheck fault planes fitness with the 
regional stress model in a Mohr diagram (Figure III.121). Because slip on a fault 
is privileged in high shear and low normal stress conditions in some events slip 
is unfavored with this stress model because shear stress (?) is low and normal 
stress (?n) is too high (e.g. 1, 4 and 5).

Zitellini et al., 2009). Also is shown the focal mechanisms selected for tensor inversion. Initial, 
we used all events in the same dataset. Yet, because in the Gorringe bank seismicity is 
distributed asymmetrically, we subdivided our catalogue into to a NE and SW sub-clusters.

unfavored with this stress model because shear stress (?) is low and normal stress (?n) is too 
high. 

To improve fault plane solutions-stress tensor model consistency we subdivided 
the original AB focal mechanisms dataset in two sub-groups because the 
seismicity distribution along the Gorringe cluster is asymmetric (see Figure 
III.119): 

1. One in the NE sector that initially integrated 12 events with an average 
minimum rotation misfit of 5.325 °. The final dataset, after excluding fault 
plane with low shear stress, included only 6 events and the minimum 
average misfit was 1.545 ° (sum up on the dataset and tensor directions 
in Table III.15, P-T axis and ?1 stereographic projections in Figure 
III.122);

boundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia 
 

186 
 

2. One in the SW sector, initially with 10 events and a RMS 6.595. After 
excluding 3 events, we reduced the average minimum degree misfit to 
2.302 (sum up on the dataset and tensor directions in Table III.15, P-T 
axis and ?1 stereographic projections in Figure III.124). 

For both sub-clusters, the ?1 azimuth is similar, 158° and 168°, for NE and SW 
datasets respectively. The dip angle is higher to the NE ?36° and lower to the 
SE ?24°. Both dip angle are considerably lower than the global solution (AB 
dataset) for which dip angle was 58°.  

The tensor solution for the NE sub-cluster shows R=0.8, considerably different 
from the results for both global and SW datasets (R=0.4 for both, Table III.15). 
In the Mohr diagram (Figure III.123), the high R value results in the following 
relative proportions between the principal stress directions: dimension ?1 &gt;&gt; ?2 
and ?3. The NE sub-cluster is clearly in a compressional regime. Also note that 
at least two events are in an unfavorable slip condition (4 and 1). Accordingly, 
these events are the ones where P-axes diverge more clearly from ?1 azimuth 
solution (see Figure III.122).

group of P-axis in PT axis projection (left- events 2, 3 and 5).

In the SW sub-cluster, all events seem to be consistent with the resulting tensor 
model. In the Mohr diagram (Figure III.125) all events fit slip conditions. The 
relative proportion between the principal stress axes are in agreement with 
global stress dataset, R=0.4. These results indicate that: 

1. The asymmetric distribution of the focal mechanism solution in the 
Gorringe cluster, with more events in the SW, biased the global dataset 
result. 

2. The NE and SW-sub-clusters are distinct and may result from different 
seismogenic mechanisms. 

Accordingly, the best fitting tensor are the solutions resulting from sub-cluster 
analyses.

Horseshoe cluster 

We started the Horseshoe cluster analysis with 21 best focal mechanism 
solutions (see Figure III.126). The first inversion test resulted in an average 
minimum rotation misfit of 5.963 degrees, with 3 very low shear slip events. In 
the next step, we removed inconsistent data and ended up with all_AB dataset 
in Table III.16 (and Figure III.127 for P-T axes and sigma 1 details). In the Mohr 
diagram only one event (see event 9 in Figure III.128) is inconsistent with the 
tensor model.

The resulting maximum compression is similar to Geissler et al. (2010) 
preliminary results for the same area (?1 with orientation 12 °, N351°E, see 
reference work). We consider that differences result from adding new events to 
initial dataset in Geissler et al (2010). Yet, divergence is larger for dip of the 
minimum stress axis that is?2°and R solution ?0.7 (idem) contrasting with our 
results, ?63° and 0.5, respectively. It is worthwhile to consider that the average 
misfit is lower in the preliminary results ?2.2° but only 13 events were included 
in the inversion process. 

To improve our result we tested 2 sub-clusters; one to the East where most 
focal mechanism solutions are clearly strike –slip and to the W with a more

complex pattern (see Figure III.126). We started with 14 events in the E sub-
cluster and a RMS of 6.43. The final dataset had 12 events and an average 
misfit of 3.271°. In the W sub-cluster, we selected 5 events and the final error 
was 1.116°. The eastern sub-cluster results (see Figure III.129 and Figure 
III.130) are similar to the total dataset but the error is lower. The stress tensor 
for western dataset is completely different from the remaining results but the 
error is considerably lower and stress directions are consistent with the 
Gorringe cluster, further to the west (see Figure III.131 and Figure III.132). 

By subdividing the dataset into two sub-clusters, we decreased both the stress 
model misfit and improved the slip conditions fit to the fault plane solutions.

São Vicente cluster  

The São Vicente cluster recorded the largest number of events (Figure III.133). 
The initial dataset included 32 events and the first inversion test resulted in an 
average misfit of 7.937°. The final dataset included 20 events and the average 
misfit was 3.836°. The P-T axes distribution in a stereographic projection 
(Figure III.134) is heterogeneous with strike direction ranging from 90°-180° and 
300°-360°.   

The best fitting ?1 strike is approximately NW- SE (Figure III.134) diverging from 
Geissler et al., (2010) preliminary results (roughly WNW-ESE) but in agreement 
with previous works (e.g. Carrilho et al., 2004). The main difference between 
this work and Geissler et al. (2010) is the dataset as in this work we present a 
complete catalogue for NEAREST experiment. The additional data resulted in a 
different stress tensor model for São Vicente cluster. Also we could reduce the 
model misfit from 4.6° in the Geissler et al, (2010) to 3.8°. The Mohr diagram 
shows that for most events are located in favorable slip conditions (except event 
9 or 20, see Figure III.135) for the derived stress tensor model.

Figure III.135- The MOHR diagram for AB dataset with the best fitting fault plane solutions (blue 
are the rotated fault planes and red are the original). The Mohr diagram shows that most events 
are located in favorable slip conditions (except event 9 or 20). 

Close inspection at the distribution of the seismic events in this cluster shows 
the existence of a roughly linear alignment of hypocentres along the São 
Vicente Canyon. Conversely, we observe that to the North events distribution is 
more discrete and to the South more diffuse. Accordingly, we divided the initial 
dataset in two sub-clusters, one to the North and the other to the South. The 
result shows that in the South dataset, the best fitting ?1 is roughly NNW -SSE 
and dipping 50° south. Yet, in the P-T axes stereographic projection (see Figure 
III.136) most plots are less steep, only 3 out of 10 events are in the dipping 
range between 30° and 60°. In the Mohr diagram we recognize that only 4 
events have reasonable slip conditions (see events 7, 8, 1 and 10 in Figure 
III.137). 

The North dataset shows a best fitting ?1 ?NW-SE coherent with most P-T axes 
plot in the stereographic projection (see Figure III.138). The best fitting tensor 
has an average minimum degree misfit of 3.4°. In the Mohr diagram shows at 
least three events (1, 5 and 7 in Figure III.139) have unfavorable slip conditions 
with low shear stress and high normal stress at the principal fault plane 
solutions. Nevertheless, the stress direction is consistent with previous works.  

In opposition to both Gorringe and Horseshoe clusters, in the São Vicente 
cluster the best fitting stress tensor results from the AB-dataset. Although, the 
events subdivision resulted in lower RMS misfit the faults slip conditions less 
favorable.

III.5. Summary and Discussion 

The meaning of the persistent small to intermediate magnitude seismicity 
recognized in the Gulf of Cadiz is still particularly not understood. To address 
this problem the EC project NEAREST conducted a passive seismic experiment 
in the Gulf of Cadiz with the deployment of temporary OBS network. The 
examination of the continuous data stream presented here allowed the 
detection of a number of local events that were not identified by the land 
networks of Portugal, Spain or Morocco.  

Preliminary earthquakes locations resulted in 590 events with local magnitude 
between 0.9-4.8, located in the deployment area with an average misfit ?0.7s.

One of the main objectives was to obtain an accurate hypocentres location. 
Solving earthquakes locations depends on several factors including survey 
network geometry, seismic phase identification and arriving time readings 
accuracies as well as the knowledge on the structure and nature of the 
seismogenic lithosphere. Other limitation outcomes from applying one 
dimensional velocity model to determine hypocenter location in a tri-dimensional 
variable space. This problem is particularly relevant when there is a high lateral 
unpredictability in the lithospheric structure as in the case of our study area. 

We improved hypocentres determination by selecting a restrict dataset (443 
events), within the deployment area and applying three different location 
methods: Joint Hypocenter Determination (JHD), simultaneous inversion for 
hypocenter-velocity model and double-difference techniques. In JHD method, 
lithospheric variability and subsurface geology were introduced by testing 
different velocity models based on local geophysical data and adding 
independent P and S stations corrections. The average misfit of the initial 
locations decreased from 0.76s to 0.32s.  

We used the VELEST, for simultaneous inversion of hypocenter location, 
stations corrections and 1D velocity model for P and S waves. As before, 
stations corrections will account for particularly subsurface geological variability. 
However, additional lithospheric variations could be introduced by adopting 
variable seismic velocities and Vp/Vs ratio for each layer within the limitation the 
1D velocity model. We decreased final locations average misfit from 0.316 to 
0.275 for the events within the deployment area.  

Finally, we tested the double-difference location method with hypoDD. This 
method is adequate if applied for events closely related because in these 
conditions it is assumed that the travel time difference between two events 
recorded in the same station results exclusively from the distance between the 
hypocentres. Accordingly, hypoDD uses a P-velocity model; S-velocities are 
derived based on fixed Vp/Vs and no stations corrections. Preliminary results 
indicate that a decrease in depth distribution in compare with previous locations 
derived from JHD and VELEST. However, we need to improve the accuracy of 
our results by testing different parameters and including wave cross-
correlations. 

The analysis of the complete data set reveals 3 main clusters of earthquakes: in 
the Gorringe Bank, Horseshoe Abyssal Plain and São Vicente Canyon. The 
later coincide with the location of the 3 larger instrumental earthquakes in the 
area: i) both the 28th February 1969 (Mw?7.8) and the 12th February 2007 
(Mw=6.0) and ii) the 17th December 2009 (MW=5.5), respectively. Most of the 
small magnitude earthquakes are located in the mantle (depth between 30 and 
50 km), like the hypocenters of these three earthquakes derived from waveform 
inversion. With respect to land stations solutions it appears that the same 
earthquakes are relocated mainly to SW and deeper.

Seismicity depths reaching a maximum of 50 km for events with Mb &gt; 5.0, in the 
Gulf of Cadiz, was already referred in Grimison and Chen (1986). In the same 
work, this depth is described as coincident with ?600°C±100°C isotherm in an 
old oceanic lithosphere. Later on, Buforn et al., 2004 also suggested, based on 
a seismic catalogue comprising events with magnitudes ? 3.5, that seismicity in 
the area is mostly located above 50 km in depth. Our results are in agreement 
with these preview studies. However, earthquakes locations are improved with 
NEAREST network as result we can clearly identify a bimodal distribution of 
seismicity in depth, with a dominant interval between 30-50 km. This was not 
clear from previous works retrieved restrictedly from land permanent seismic 
networks locations. In NEAREST preliminary data published in Geissler et al. 
(2010), it was observed a striking absence of seismicity between 20 and 40 km 
in depth. In our study this interval is reduced to roughly between 10 and 20 km. 
In the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain there is an absence of events above 15 Km in 
depth and in the Gorringe Bank above 10 km. However, the São Vicente 
Canyon cluster has some events above 10 km but most seismicity is 
concentrate between 20 and 50 km. 

Our focal mechanism solutions indicate a mixed pattern, mostly strike-slip and 
reverse dip-slip with a very few normal mechanisms, showing us that processes 
related with the local seismicity must be complex probably involving the 
interaction between different active geological structures and reflecting local 
rheological contrasts. These hypotheses will be further explored in the next 
chapter. The retrieved pattern was already envisaged in Geissler et al. (2010) 
and is coherent with Carrilho et al. (2004) results retrieved from events with 
1.9&gt;ML&gt; 3.7 recorded at land seismic stations (IPMA).  

NEAREST network dataset includes mostly micro-seismicity (only 6 out of 82 
focal mechanism solutions with ML &gt;3.5). It is not clear that micro-seismicity and 
intermediate to high magnitude earthquakes have comparable or similar source 
mechanism. Conversely, NEAREST solutions are in agreement also with earlier 
studies of Grimison and Chen (1986), Borges et al. (2001), Buforn et al. (2004) 
or Stich et al. (2010) based on events with magnitudes &gt;3.5.  A rather puzzling 
result is the presence of normal dip-slip mechanisms at 30 or 50 km in depth. 
The same observation was already described both in Geissler et al. (2010) and 
Stich et al. (2010).  

The stress tensor analysis show a maximum compression roughly parallel to 
NW-SE in the Western Horseshoe sub-cluster, the São Vicente cluster and the 
SW Gorringe to nearly NNW-SSE in the NE Gorringe and in the Eastern 
Horseshoe sub-clusters.

This chapter is presented in paper format as accepted, with moderate revisions, 
in Tectonophysics. Here, we compare the recorded seismicity with the locations 
of the major active faults and lithospheric transitions, pursuing evidences for 
minor and major earthquakes source mechanisms in Gulf of Cadiz area.  

IV.1. Abstract  

The seismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz is characterized by permanent low to 
intermediate magnitude earthquakes, occasionally disturbed by high magnitude 
events such as the M~8.7 1755 Great Lisbon earthquake or the M=7.9 event of 
28th February 1969. Micro-seismicity was recorded during one year by a 
temporary network of 25 ocean bottom seismometers (OBSs) in an area of high 
seismic activity, encompassing the potential source areas of the mentioned 
large magnitude earthquakes. We combined micro-seismicity analysis with 
processing and interpretation of deep crustal seismic reflection profiles and 
available refraction data to investigate the possible tectonic control of the 
seismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz area. Three relationships with seismicity are 
explored: i) active tectonic structures, ii) lithospheric transitions and inherited 
Mesozoic architectures and iii) fault weakening mechanisms. Our results show 
that micro-seismicity is located mostly in the upper mantle. It seems to be 
associated with the tectonic inversion of extensional rift basins and to the 
transition between different lithospheric/rheological domains. Even though 
crustal tectonics is well imaged in the seismic profiles and in the bathymetry it 
shows low to inexistent seismic activity. This may be explained by the fact that 
thin-skinned (crustal) thrusts root on sub-horizontal décollements associated 
with aseismic serpentinization levels and co-seismically slip only during large 
magnitude events, remaining locked or slip aseismically for most of the inter-
seismic cycle. We thus speculate that high magnitude earthquakes also 
nucleate in the lithospheric mantle and then propagate into the crust across the 
serpentinized layer.

IV.2. Introduction  

The Gulf of Cadiz is located in the eastern termination of the Azores-Gibraltar 
plate boundary between Africa and Eurasia, west of the Gibraltar arc (Fig. 
IV.1A). Here the plate boundary is known to be diffuse, whereas the 
deformation is partitioned along several discrete structures (e.g. Terrinha et al., 
2009; Fig. IV.1B). The seismicity is characterized by scattered events of low to 
intermediate magnitude (Fig. IV.1C and Table IV.1), occasionally with high 
magnitude earthquakes. An example is the 1st of November 1755 Great Lisbon 
earthquake that had an estimated magnitude of 8.7 (Johnston, 1996) that 
produced a ocean-wide tsunami with waves up to 6 meter high in Lisbon and 
10-15 meters at Cape São Vicente, in the Southern Portuguese coast (Baptista 
and Miranda, 2009). In the instrumental record, the most significant event was 
the 28th February of 1969 with a Ms ? 7.9 (Fukao, 1973, Fig. IV.1C and Table 
IV.1), which generated a small tsunami recorded in several tide-gauges 
reaching a maximum amplitude of 0.6 m in Casablanca (Baptista et al., 2009 
and references therein).

NEAREST deployment area (from Buforn et al.,1988, Stich et al., 2010 and Custódio et al., 
2016) on top of the main tectonic structures in the Gulf of Cadiz. 

In the last decades, research projects concerning the investigation of the 
seismogenic and tsunamigenic sources in the area favored the densification of 
bathymetry and near-vertical reflection, wide-angle reflection and refraction 
seismic coverage. This effort resulted in a remarkable increase of our 
understanding of the Gulf of Cadiz tectonic structures and associated activity. 
Notwithstanding, there is still a poor correlation between the seismicity and the 
identified active faults as illustrated in Figs. IV.1B-C. An example is the 
uncertainty about the source of the 28th February 1969 earthquake. The focal 
mechanism solution (FMs) shows reverse kinematics, but some authors favour 
an east-west striking fault plane (e.g Buforn et al., 1988) whereas others choose 
a N550E striking fault plane (e.g Fukao, 1973), parallel to the striking of the 
Gorringe Bank (Figs. IV.1B-C). Moreover, following the empirical laws for fault 
models in the Gulf of Cadiz lithosphere proposed by Matias et al. (2013), it 
would be expected that a MW=7.8 event would produce a rupture area of ?3,410 
km2, with a length of 64 km and a width of 53 km. However, there is no 
agreement to which is the tectonic structure that caused the 1969 event (see 
Fig. IV.1B-C). 

More recently, the moment tensor inversion of the 12th February 2007 Mw=6.0 
event showed a thrust kinematics with a small strike-slip component (USGS 
source). The preferred fault plane orientations are discussed in Stich et al. 
(2007) and Custódio et al. (2012) but they reached contradictory results. Stich 
et al. (2007) suggested an ENE-WSW solution, sub-parallel to the Horseshoe 



Strain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate 
boundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia 
 

204 
 

Fault (Fig. IV.1B-C). However, the selected plane is located 20 km to east of the 
Horseshoe fault and dipping in the opposite direction to the fault, down to a 
depth of 40 km. On the other hand, Custódio et al. (2012) proposed a WNW -
ESE solution, sub-parallel to the SWIM strike-slip faults (see Fig. IV. 1B for 
location) dipping 46º to the SW. Both Matias et al. (2013) fault model 
formulation and Stich et al, (2007) calculations report a rupture area of ?54 km2 
with a length of ? 8.2 km and a width of 6.5 km. Even though this event had its 
source near known major active tectonic structures, none of these structures 
seems to be compatible with the proposed fault plane solutions. 

One of the main restrictions in finding a cause-effect relationship between 
seismicity and associated tectonic faults results from the limited geographic and 
asymmetric distribution of the permanent seismic land networks used for 
earthquakes’ location around the Gulf of Cadiz. These leads to high azimuthal 
gaps resulting in lower accuracy in hypocentre determination. A key goal of the 
NEAREST project (Integrated observation from NEAR shore sourcES of 
Tsunamis: towards an early warning system) was to improve the location of the 
seismogenic and tsunamigenic sources in the Gulf of Cadiz. In order to 
guaranty a better accuracy of the recorded seismicity, 24 ocean-bottom 
seismometers (LOBSTER- Long term Ocean Bottom Seismometer for Tsunami 
and Earthquake Research) and a multi-parametric station – GEOSTAR were 
deployed in this area to record seismic events for nearly one year (Carrara et 
al., 2008).  

In the present work we will address the following questions: I) How micro-
seismicity is distributed in the Gulf of Cadiz area; II) What are the relations 
between the rheology, tectonic and micro-seismicity distribution? III) Is there 
any spatial relationship between high and low magnitude seismicity? IV) Can 
micro-seismicity studies provide us with a new insight on the seismogenic and 
tsunamigenic faults in the study area? 

Our study is based on the processing and analysis of the seismic data recorded 
with the NEAREST stations and by the permanent land stations network (from 
Instituto Português do Mar e da Atmosfera - IPMA and Instituto Dom Luiz - IDL) 
combined with processing of original multichannel seismic (MCS) reflection 
profiles and the re-interpretation/integration of published MCS and refraction 
profiles existing in the study area.

IV.3. Geodynamic Setting  

The Gulf of Cadiz straddles across the present day Nubia-Eurasia plate 
boundary in the Central Atlantic Ocean, off the southwest Iberia and the 
northwest Morocco coasts. This plate boundary is defined by a wide zone of 
deformation comprising the WNW-ESE striking SWIM dextral strike-slip faults 
irregularly connected by major NE-SW thrust faults (Zitellini et al., 2009; Duarte 
et al., 2013, Hensen et al., 2015). According to recent seismic refraction and 
reflection data, the central part of the Gulf of Cadiz is floored by oceanic 
lithosphere (Sallarès et al., 2011; Martínez-Loriente et al., 2014, see Fig. IV.1B). 
This fragment of oceanic lithosphere corresponds to a narrow oceanic basin of 
the western Alpine-Tethys (Sallarès et al., 2011), a transtensional corridor that

boundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia 
 

206 
 

connected the Tethyan and the Boreal seas (Terrinha et al., 2002; Duarte et al., 
2011) probably from middle-late Jurassic. 

The early continental tectonic extension in the Gulf of Cadiz region was largely 
controlled by late Variscan inherited NE-SW faults bounding distinct rifting 
basins and future abyssal plains in the Southwest Iberia (Pereira and Alves, 
2013; see their Fig. IV. 2 and references therein). The southernmost of these 
faults is the 500 km Messejana Fault zone that hosts a ~200My dolerite dyke of 
the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (Youbi et al., 2003) (Fig. IV. 1B). The 
São Vicente canyon, one of the major morphologic features of southwest Iberia 
is partially controlled by the NE-SW striking São Vicente Fault. 

In the Horseshoe Abyssal plain, the transition between the North Atlantic from 
Western Tethys Jurassic basins is delineated by the Horseshoe Abyssal plain 
fault (HAT - Martínez-Loriente et al., 2014, Fig. IV. 1B). The HAT separates a 
band of exhumed serpentinized continental mantle, extending to the Gorringe 
Bank and Tagus Abyssal Plain, from the Western Tethyan Basin, formed during 
the early opening of the North Atlantic that initiated in the late Jurassic (Sallarès 
et al., 2013). This interpretation is in agreement with the early Purdy (1975) 
refraction data results that showed upper mantle velocities of 7.2–7.4 km/s and 
with the tectonic interpretation of MCS images by Rovere et al. (2004). Between 
rifting episodes, the Gulf of Cadiz area was marked by several inversion 
episodes, well described in the onshore Algarve basin, in the lower Jurassic, 
middle Jurassic to upper Jurassic transition and upper Jurassic to early 
Cretaceous (Terrinha et al., 2002). According to Terrinha et al. (2002), thermal 
subsiding episodes, local inversion of the oblique transtensional tectonics and 
ridge push are pointed-out as possible combined geodynamic mechanisms to 
explain these transient phases.  

From late Cretaceous-Paleogene the convergence between Africa and Iberia 
was accommodated by the inversion of the extensional Mesozoic fabric (Roque, 
2007, Duarte et al, 2009; Terrinha et al., 2009). During this period an 
accretionary wedge (or thrust belt) was formed that extended from Gibraltar 
across the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain (Terrinha et al, 2009).  

From SE Iberia to the western Alps, the N-S convergence was accommodated 
in a subduction zone that consumed most of the Alpine-Tethys oceanic domain. 
In the Oligocene, the convergence of between Africa and Eurasia slowed down 
triggering the initiation of a southeast-directed subduction rollback (Rosenbaum 
et al., 2004 and references therein). Lonergan and White (1997) and Gutscher 
et al. (2002, 2006, 2012) showed how this subduction-arc-system evolved into 
an east-dipping subduction zone below the Gibraltar Arc down to ~700km in 
depth based on seismic tomography. Deep seismic reflection profiles showed 
the presence of an accretionary wedge (GCAW-Fig. IV. 1B) consisting of a pile 
of SW-verging thrust faults rooting in a NE-dipping décollement under the 
Gibraltar Arc. These are two of the most solid evidences for the existence of this

micro-seismicity, high magnitude earthquakes and active faults? 

 

207 
 

subduction zone, even though its present day activity is still disputed (e.g., 
Zitellini et al., 2009; Duarte et al., 2013).  

A new tectonic map based on re-interpretation of the main active faults resulted 
in the idea that an incipient subduction zone may be forming and propagating 
along the Western Iberia, marked by a set of compressive structures (the 
Gorringe, Horseshoe and Marques de Pombal thrust faults, Duarte et al., 2013). 
The tectonic reactivation of this passive margin would be the result of the 
propagation of stresses from the fading Gibraltar subduction zone and stresses 
related to the large-scale convergence between Africa and Eurasia (Duarte et 
al., 2013; Terrinha et al., 2009).  

According to Zitellini et al (2009), the SWIM Faults, a 600 km long, 80 km wide 
band of WNW-ESE dextral strike-slip faults (Fig. IV. 1B) is the precursor of a 
new transcurrent plate boundary connecting the Gloria Fault to the Rif-Tell Fault 
Zone. However, Cunha et al. (2012) investigated the neotectonics of the Gulf 
Cadiz using a thin-shell modeling approach for the region and conclude that 
models dominated by continuous 600km SWIM faults would absorb all the 
seismic strain and would not reproduce the deformation along the NE-SW thrust 
system (e.g Horseshoe and Gorringe Faults). Notwithstanding, the SWIM faults 
(continuous or discontinuous) appear to connect the two main compressive 
fronts in the region, the Gibraltar arc and the SW Iberia thrust system, acting as 
a major lithospheric transfer zone (Duarte et al., 2013). Neres et al. (2016) 
using the same numerical approach favored the existence of an independent 
Alboran plate overriding the Gibraltar subducted slab. 

Present day kinematic models for the Eurasia (Iberia) – Africa (Nubia) plate 
boundary estimate a convergence rate of 4-5 mm/yr, with an approximate 
WNW-ESE to NW-SE horizontal motion (Fig. IV.1, Argus et al., 1989, DeMets et 
al., 1994, Nocquet and Calais, 2004, Calais et al., 2003, Fernandes et al., 2003, 
Stich et al., 2006 and Serpelloni et al., 2007) compatible with the SWIM faults 
dextral strike-slip kinematics. The average maximum horizontal compression 
(SHmax) is oriented NW-SE as defined by borehole, focal mechanisms and 
moment tensor analysis (Fig. IV.1, Ribeiro et al. 1996, Borges et al., 2001, Stich 
et al., 2006 and Heidbach et al, 2008). Preliminary tensor analysis based on 36 
events recorded in NEAREST OBS network (Geissler et al., 2010) retrieved a 
roughly NNW-SSE, maximum horizontal compression in the Horseshoe Abyssal 
plain and nearly NW-SE in the São Vicente canyon, consistent with previous 
solutions for moderate to large earthquakes.  

IV.4. Data and Methods 

IV.4.1. Microseismicity data acquisition and processing  

The NEAREST network consisted in 24 broadband OBSs (Ocean Bottom 
Seismometers) from the German DEPAS pool (Deutscher Geräte-Pool für 



Strain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate 
boundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia 
 

208 
 

amphibische Seismologie / German instrument pool for amphibian seismology) 
and a multiparametric station GEOSTAR from INGV (Istituto Nazionale di 
Geofisica e Vulcanologia). Both the OBSs and the GEOSTAR were equipped 
with Güralp CMG-40T broadband seismometers and High-tech HTI-04-OBS 
PCA/ULF and OAS DC- 50 Hz hydrophones, respectively (see Fig. IV. 1B for 
locations). The instruments were deployed in August 2007 and acquired data 
continuously for 11 months, with a sampling rate of 100Hz recording 
teleseismic, regional and local events. All stations were operational during at 
least 8 months. The clocks were synchronized with GPS time before 
deployment and after recovering. The internal clock drifts in the operational 
stations were corrected by using a linear interpolation method.  

The events were extracted from a continuous waveform data set using both an 
automatic REF-TEK trigger algorithm, short-time-average through long-time-
average (STA/LTA), and by visual inspection of daily spectrograms from the 
vertical seismometer component. After extracting the events, we performed a 
preliminary quality check based on the consistency of the P and S waves 
arrivals recognized in the different stations. 767 events out of the identified 1357 
events were considered to be of high to medium quality and could therefore be 
located. From the overall extracted events, 364 were also detected with the 
Portuguese land stations network (from the Instituto Português do Mar e da 
Atmosfera-IPMA and the Instituto Dom Luiz-IDL). However, 58 of these events 
were only recorded in land permanent stations but not in the NEAREST 
stations. These earthquakes were located outside or at the limit of the 
deployment area and near the Portuguese South coast (mostly in the 
Guadalquivir Bank region; See Fig. IV. 1B). 

The data analysis was carried out using the SEISAN 9.0.1 Seismic Analysis 
package (Havskov and Ottemöller, 2011). All the events were picked and 
weighted manually for P and S waves’ first arrivals, generally in the three 
components seismometer and in the unfiltered signal. The hydrophone was 
used only as alternative for P wave picking and polarity confirmations.  

For preliminary earthquake location and magnitude estimation was used the 
HYP2, a modified version of HYPOCENTER of Lienert (1994) to include 
independent S delays. We started by adopting the same velocity model used in 
Geissler et al. (2010) but in addition we tested other models constrained by 
wide-angle seismic reflection and refraction data from Sallàres et al. (2011, 
2013) and Martínez-Loriente et al. (2014). For each event, depth was checked 
using a systematic RMS (root mean square) misfit -depth search approach 
(Havskov and Ottemöller, 2011). The selected solution was the one with the 
lowest misfit.  

For local magnitude (ML) estimation it was used Carrilho and Vales (2009) 
formulation for Portugal and adjacent areas:

micro-seismicity, high magnitude earthquakes and active faults? 

 

209 
 

= + 1.287 ? + 0.00061? ? 2.147 

Where A is the amplitude measured in a Wood- Anderson synthetic display (in 
nm) and ? is the hypocentral distance. This is the same formulation applied in 
and in routine geophysical observation at the IPMA Seismological Operational 
Centre.  

To improve events locations, we used the VELEST algorithm to simultaneous 
invert hypocenters locations; stations corrections and the velocity model (see 
details on the method in Kissiling, 1995). To determine an accurate minimum 
1D-velocity, it is recommended to use well-located events with observational 
azimuthal gaps lower than 180° and at least 10 P wave picks (Husen et al.,. 
1999). As input, it is also suggested to use a minimum sample of 500 well 
located events. For the present case study, we have only 443 events in the 
deployment area. From those, few match the desired parameters. So, we 
considered less restrictive conditions as previously assumed by e.g. Carrilho et 
al. (2004) or Ruiz et al. (2011). The final selection included 269 events with an 
RMS misfit of 0.281s, with a total number of P- and S- phase observations 
greater than 10, an azimuthal gap lower than 210º (the averaged GAP was 
112º) and a minimum of 3 P-wave first arrival observations (phase readings are 
dominated by S-wave pickings due to dominant poor to fair S/N in locations with 
a thick sedimentary cover). One of the main constraints in using a 1D velocity 
model to determine earthquakes location in the Gulf of Cadiz is the diversity of 
crustal and upper mantle domains. Adding station delays to the velocity model 
helps to correct for subsurface geological variations below the recording 
stations. Finally, we re-located all events using the initial HYP2 application and 
the velocity model resulted from VELEST application. Note that HYP2 
application allows the use of both independent Vp, Vs models (variable Vp/Vs) 
and P, S stations delays. 

The FMs were derived from P wave first motion polarity both from the 
NEAREST network stations (BB OBS and GEOSTAR) and from the land 
stations (see Fig. IV. 1B). FMs were computed using the double-couple fault-
plane solution program - FPFIT (Reasenberg and Oppenheimer, 1985). The 
minimum criterion for trying a solution was 10 polarities readings and a quality 
classification was determined based on polarity misfits and on the standard 
deviation parameters computed with FPFIT for each solution (quality 
parameters in table III. 11, in the previous subchapter III.4.2 and a display of all 
focal mechanism solutions is presented in detail in the appendix III and IV.A-D).  

We used the Focal Mechanism Stress Inversion (FMSI, Gephart and Forsyth, 
1984) package to derive the best stress tensor that explains the FMs 
determined in studied area. We restricted our data to the FMs recovered from 
NEAREST OBS experiment and analyzed in this work. Fault plane solutions 
published in previous works were based on land network records only, which

are intrinsically poorly constrained, particularly if low to intermediate magnitude 
seismicity was used. Conversely, better constrained higher magnitude events 
may express a regional stress tensor rather than a local complex interaction of 
rupture mechanisms that may be associated with the micro-seismicity.  

The FMSI retrieves the orientation of the ?1, ?2, ?3 and a stress magnitude 
parameter, R= (?2-?1)/(?3-?1). These results were used to compute SHmax and 
the dominant stress regime in each area. We followed the World Stress Map 
Project guidelines for formal stress inversions of focal mechanisms. 
Accordingly, we used the formulation in Lund and Townend (2007) for SH-
determination and in Zoback (1992) for dominant stress regime determinations. 

IV.4.2.Multichannel seismic reflection and refraction profiles 

The multichannel seismic reflection (MCS) and refraction profiles studied in this 
work were selected specifically to support geological and rheological 
understanding of the results retrieved from passive seismic experiment. 
Accordingly, all the selected MCS profiles, except for IAM-GB1, are depth 
sections which allowed a correlation between the tectonic fabric and seismicity 
distribution. The chosen profiles and references are presented in Fig. IV. 1B. 

The Seismic profile IAM-GB1 was selected for depth conversion because it 
strikes perpendicularly to the southern cluster of hypocenters in Geissler et al. 
(2010) and to the boundary between the Central Atlantic Ocean Northern limit 
(Martínez et al., 2014). Therefore, we could expect to have a clear image of the 
crustal structure and its relation to the micro-seismicity (Fig. IV.10). Details on 
the acquisition parameters and processing sequence are presented in the next 
section.  

IV.4.2.1.Acquisition parameters and processing sequence of multichannel 
seismic 

IAM-GB1 profile (see Fig. IV. 1B for location) was acquired during the Iberian 
Atlantic Margins (IAM) project funded by the European Community project 
JOU2-CT92-0177 (Banda et al., 1995). The energy source was a SWAG air-
gun array with a total energy volume of 7524 cu. in. The source depth was 10 m 
and the shot interval 75 m. The receivers were contained in a streamer with 192 
groups with an interval of 25 m, with five auxiliary channels. The streamer was 
at a depth of 18 m. The sample rate was 4 ms and the record length 25 s. A 
high-cut filter at 92 Hz with a slope of 72 dB/oct and a constant gain of 24dB 
were applied during acquisition. No low-cut filter was applied. The primary 
navigation system was a Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS). 

Seismic reflection profile IAM-GB1 was re-processed in order to obtain a clearer 
image of the basement structure across the SWIM faults and the Central 
Atlantic-Tethys Oceanic boundaries proposed by Martínez-Loriente et al. 
(2014). The IAM-GB1 seismic profile re-processing was performed using the

software Globe Claritas from GNS Science, a package for 2D and 3D land and 
marine seismic data. The processing sequence was trace mute, in-line 
geometry; trace editing, brute stack, velocity analysis, 2-window statistical 
deconvolution, stacking, time and space variant bandpass filtering, time and 
space velocity variant finite differences time migration and post-migration depth 
conversion, using a geologically meaningful velocity model. The velocity model 
used in the depth conversion was defined by picking several major horizons in 
the time migration. Subsequently, velocities were assigned to the different 
layers bounded by horizons. Velocities were extracted from refraction and wide-
angle reflection seismic profile - P1 (Martínez-Loriente et al., 2014) acquired 
also under the scope of the NEAREST project (see Fig. IV. 1B for locations). 
We used interval velocities from 1800 m/s at the uppermost sediments to 4700 
m/s at their base. Three layers were defined for the crustal basement velocities 
with velocities of 5800 m/s and, 6300 m/s and the lowermost layer with 7200 
m/s. 

IV.5. Results 

IV.5.1.Seismological analysis 

IV.5.1.1. Velocity model and stations corrections 

The velocity model shown in Fig. IV. 2 is the best fit 1D velocity model that 
complies with P and S observations for the 269 investigated events (out of 443 
events). The derivation of this velocity model included the computation of P and 
S stations corrections. The positive and negative corrections coincide with 
higher and lower sediment thickness, respectively, indicating a good 
correspondence between the model and sub-surface geology (see subchapter 
III.3.2.5).  

However, since the NEAREST OBS deployment area is described as a region 
comprising different lithospheric domains as old Jurassic oceanic, thinned 
continental lithosphere and exhumed serpentinized mantle (Sallarès et al., 
2011, Gonzalez et al., 1996, Sallarès et al., 2013 and Martínez-Loriente, 2014) 
our velocity model can be viewed as a mean representative value of the 
lithospheric structure of the study area.  

If we compare P-minimum velocity model (Fig. IV.2A) with the refraction and 
wide-angle reflection data in the Gulf of Cadiz area, we observe that for the 
sediments layers the velocities are higher. Both in Sallarès et al. (2011) and 
Martínez –Loriente (2014) velocity solutions range from 1.8 to to 4.0 km/s for 
the upper and lower layers, respectively. In our velocity model, in the upper 
layer Vp is 3.3 km/s and in the lower layer Vp is 3.6 km/s. We recall that for 
earthquakes location we replace layers resulting from gradient velocities 
(refraction data) with interval velocities layers. This will explain partially the 
differences here reported for velocities values. Also, we knew that during the

derivation of the final models, the velocities in these layers were poorly 
constrained because few hypocenters occurred at these depths.  

Crustal velocities range from 5.18 km/s to 7.08 km/s are slightly higher than the 
results from NEAREST refraction profile P2 (Sallarès et al., 2011) ranging from 
4.6–4.8 km/s at the top to 6.9–7.1 km/s at the base. The transition between 
lower crust and upper mantle is ?16km in depth. The Moho depth is in 
conformity with the results published in Sallarès et al. (2011). The uppermost 
part of the lithospheric mantle (16 to 22 km) yielded Vp in the range of 7.6 to 7.8 
km/s and high Vp/Vs ratios (Fig. IV.2B) is compatible with hydrated mantle 
(Christensen, 2004). In Fig. IV. 2C, we established a general compositional 
model based on the computed Vp and comparison with previous seismic 
refraction results in the area.

IV.5.1.2.Seismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz 

The NEAREST Network experiment allowed for better constrained earthquake 
locations in the Gulf of Cadiz area. Previous earthquake’s detection and 
location were made using land station networks only, with restricted and 
asymmetric geographical distributions. This resulted in a limited control of the 
offshore seismic activity. Geissler et al. (2010) previous study, using a selection

213 
 

of 36 events of the NEAREST network, showed the importance of using OBS 
networks to obtain more accurate hypocenter locations in this area.  

The present work reports the final results from the NEAREST OBS experiment 
that include 443 events identified in more than 6 stations within the deployment 
area. The root mean square travel time residuals is 0.275s. The mean errors for 
longitude, latitude and depth are 2.6 km, 3.7 km and 6.8 km, respectively. A key 
finding is that 84% of the seismicity occurs at depths between 25 and 50 km, 
within unaltered lithospheric mantle (Figs. IV. 2 -3).  

The seismicity recorded in the NEAREST network included local magnitudes 
ranging from 1.1 to 4.8. The highest magnitude earthquake (with ML= 4.8) 
occurred in the São Vicente Canyon at 00:21 a.m. on the 11st of January, 2008. 

Visual inspection of the hypocenters distribution in Fig. IV. 3 shows three well 
defined clusters: i) a northern cluster, in the area of the São Vicente Canyon, ii) 
a western cluster, in the Gorringe Bank, and iii) a southern cluster, at the SW 
termination of the Horseshoe Fault. In addition to these clusters, scattered 
seismicity was recorded in the areas of the Guadalquivir Bank, Portimão Bank, 
Coral Patch Ridge and Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge (see Fig. IV. 3). Some 
regional and teleseismic events were also recorded but they are not analyzed in 
this work (for more details see Monna et al., 2013). 

We observe that the São Vicente and Gorringe clusters are elongated along 
NNE-SSW to NE-SW directions, respectively, sub-parallel to active thrust faults. 
In the case of the São Vicente cluster, seismicity extends from the footwall of 
the Horseshoe Fault to the NE along the São Vicente Fault. The Gorringe 
cluster strikes parallel to the main NE-striking thrust fault that marks the NW 
limit of this submarine relief. Unlike the other clusters, the Horseshoe cluster 
has a WNW-ESE to NW-SE strike, slightly clockwise rotated with respect to the 
SWIM faults. The Guadalquivir Bank was previously described as an area of 
dense seismic activity (e.g. Buforn et al, 2004, Custódio et al., 2015), but few 
earthquakes were identified in this work, probably because it was outside the 
NEAREST network. It is worthwhile to note that some well-constrained events 
were recorded in the Portimão Bank and in the northwestern part of the 
accretionary wedge, which are located at the limit of the deployment area.  

The analysis of the NEAREST OBS data resulted in the determination of 124 
focal mechanisms, 82 of which were considered well defined with magnitudes 
ranging between 1.9 and 4.8 (see focal mechanism solution in Fig. IV. 4 and 
details on Appendix III and IV.A-D), i.e. we added 58 new solutions to previous 
catalogues and synthesis (Geissler et al., 2010, Stich et al., 2010, Domingues 
et al., 2013, Custódio et al., 2016). Because we considered events with at least 
10 polarities, two events from Geissler et al. (2010) catalogue are not included 
in our (events 5th and 21st of March 2008, with 9 polarities, in the southern 
cluster in Fig. IV. 3 of the referenced work). In addition, three other solutions in

boundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia

Geissler at al. (2010) were revised and evaluated as poorly constrained and 
thus were excluded from our catalogue (the 22nd of May 2008 in the southern 
cluster and outside the clusters area and both the 6th and the 7th of November 
2007, ibid).

Figure IV.4 FMs obtained from the NEAREST network experiment (details on FMs are provided 
in Appendix III and IV.A-D). The results here presented add 58 new focal mechanisms to the 
previous catalogue in Geissler et al. (2010). Note that apart from the diversity of FMs, the 
predominant fault solutions are reverse dip-slip and strike-slip solutions with a few normal dip-
slip. 

In the Gorringe cluster, 31 FMs were computed (Fig. IV. 4, details on the events 
in Appendix III.A and IV_A). These new solutions are a substantial addition to 
the previous catalogues, where few FMs were known, particularly within the 
magnitude range of the NEAREST experiment (see Fig. IV. 1C, information 
from e.g. Grimison and Chen, 1986; Buforn et al., 2004, Stich et al, 2010 and 
Custódio et al., 2016). In the Horseshoe cluster, 26 fault plane solutions were 
obtained (Fig. IV. 4, details on the events in Appendix III.B and IV_B) with 10 
events common to Geissler et al. (2010). We identified 33 FMs in the São 
Vicente Cluster (Fig. IV. 4, details on the events in Appendix III.C and IV_C) 
adding 17 new events to the previous dataset. We obtained some discrepancies 
in relation to the Geissler et al. (2010) events, mostly resulting from adding new 
polarities to their preliminary solutions.   

Outside the clusters areas, particularly in the area of the Gulf of Cadiz 
Accretionary Wedge (GCAW) we computed few FMs (see Fig. IV.4 and details 
on the events in Appendix III.D and IV_D). In the GCAW we obtained some 



Strain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate 
boundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia 
 

216 
 

nearly reverse dip-slip FMs (events 109, 111 and 112). Near the SWIM 2 fault, it 
was computed two pure strike-slip FMs (events 122 and 123). At the lower limit 
of the Portimão bank, we also computed a reverse dip-slip FMs (event 108). All 
these events are located between ?30 and 40 km in depth. Since these FMs are 
located outside or in the limit of the NEAREST network, we will not discuss the 
source mechanism of these events.  

In general, the predominant fault-plane solutions are reverse dip-slip and strike-
slip solutions. These results are in agreement with the preliminary solutions 
published in Geissler et al. (2010) based on the best events reported from the 
NEAREST experiment. They are also consistent with previous studies carried 
out in this area for moderate to large earthquakes (e.g. Grimison and Chen, 
1986; Buforn et al., 2004; Stich et al., 2010, Custodio et al., 2016). 
Notwithstanding, some normal dip-slip solutions were identified in the upper 
mantle, as already reported in Stich et al. (2010) and Geissler et al. (2010). The 
diversity of the FMs reflects the complexity of the source mechanisms of this 
low to intermediate magnitude seismicity. We cannot find a dominant fault 
mechanism or common fault plane for any of the clusters investigated. 

During the NEAREST experiment 291 events were recorded and located by the 
permanent land network in the area of the OBS deployment (data provided by 
IPMA). From these, only 179 events were recorded and located by both 
networks. If we compare the epicenter distribution obtained from the two 
networks, we observe that most of the locations using the land stations are 
offset landwards (Fig. IV. 5). Most of the events are displaced between 0.1 and 
0.3 degrees in latitude and longitude and 20 to 30 km in depth. In what regards 
the depth distribution, the locations based on the land network are 
systematically shallower than the NEAREST OBS solutions, with differences 
reaching up to 60 km (Fig. IV. 5). Sub-horizontal alignments around depths of 
15 km and 30 km that were detected using the land network were not imaged 
by the NEAREST network. These alignments are probably artifacts produced by 
manually fixing earthquake’s depths (which is typically done for poorly 
constrained events). 

Finally, if we compare magnitudes estimations most events (98%) recorded by 
the land network are systematically underestimated (note that we used the 
same formulation for magnitude estimation as IPMA). Differences in magnitude 
vary between -0,1 and 1,0; however, in 83% of the events the underestimation 
by the land network is between 0,2-0,6, only. All these differences highlight the 
limitations of the land stations distribution and of the velocity models. Moreover, 
it outlines the necessity of using better stations distribution for the location of 
earthquakes in the Gulf of Cadiz region, in particular in what concerns low to 
intermediate magnitude events. A new strategy for the location of these events 
by the land networks should be developed in the light of the results obtained in 
this study.

Figure IV.5- Differences in the location of seismic events recorded by the NEAREST network 
(red circles) and the permanent land network (green circles). It is possible to observe that the 
hypocentres located by the land stations are biased towards land and shallow depths. The black 
arrows mark the directions of the profiles also shown in the figure (N-S on the right and W-E on 
the bottom); the black triangles are the seismic stations location. 

In the next sections, we will describe in detail the seismicity in the three 
clusters. We describe our results based on our observations in map view and in 
cross-sections. In both displays, we present the crustal-upper mantle transitions 
in the area. Note that these limits are speculated based on the available 
discontinuous geophysical data (refraction and wide angle reflection profiles, 
see references in Fig. IV.1B). In particular, we should point out that the layer 
with serpentinized mantle is drawn based on previous evidences for low upper 
mantle velocities down to ?20km (down to 14 km in refraction profile B-BR from 
Purdy, 1975 and ?20 km in MCS reflection profile IAM-03 from Gonzalez et al., 
1996 as well as in NEAREST refraction profiles P2 and P1 from Sallarès et al., 
2011 and Martínez-Loriente et al., 2014, see profiles location in Fig. IV. 1B). 
Furthermore, the serpentinization layer should be discontinuous; the geometry 
shown in the cross-sections is a simplification. Finally, we will also look in detail 
to the fault plane solutions in each cluster, the best fitting stress tensor, 
resulting maximum horizontal stress and general stress regime characterization 
(a resume in Table IV.2).

IV.5.1.3.The Gorringe cluster 

The Gorringe seismicity cluster is defined as a broad alignment of epicentres 
striking NE-SW along the Gorringe Bank (Fig. IV. 6A). Here the seismicity is 
asymmetric with a higher number of events concentrated to the southwest (see 
map and profiles PRF01-03 in Fig. IV. 6). In profile PRF02, we observe that the 
events distribution is diffuse (Fig. IV. 6C) while to the NE it becomes 
progressively more discrete, defining roughly a SE dipping alignment with a flat-
ramp geometry (see profile PRF01 Fig. IV. 6B). The longitudinal profile PRF03 
(Fig. IV. 6D) also shows a variation in the clustering pattern of the events. In this 
case, they are slightly more disperse to the SW. Below the Ormonde seamount, 
there is an alignment that plunges to the NE, towards the thinned continental 
domain (Fig. IV. 6D). The transition between the two sub-clusters is marked by 
a possible steep boundary (see profile PRF03 in Fig. IV. 6D).  

In the Gorringe cluster, the dominant FMs are strike –slip and reverse dip-slip 
with a few normal fault events. In map view, it seems that pure-strike slip 
mechanisms are mostly located in the SW and NE limit of the Gorringe cluster, 
while reverse (and oblique) slip are found in the central part of the cluster, sub-
parallel to the Gorringe fault.

Figure IV.6- The Gorringe cluster. A. Map view with the epicenter distribution and FMs. We 
recognized that events roughly define a NE-SW alignment. Epicenter locations are asymmetric 
with more events to the SW. In NE and SW sub-clusters, SHmax is roughly NNW-SSE and sub-
parallel to ?1 trend (The background colors define the lithospheric limits in Fig. IV. 1B, details on 
the tensor and SHmax in Table IV.2). B-D- Cross-sections and bathymetric profiles across the 
seismicity cluster (bathymetric profiles with a vertical exaggeration of ? 2.5× and all the profiles 
are a projection of the earthquakes located within a 40 km wide band). B-C: NW-SE cross-
sections are plotted in the profiles PRF-01 and PRF-02. In profile PRF-01, the seismicity is more 
diffuse while to NNE, in the profile PRF-02, it becomes more discrete and defines a flat-ramp 
geometry (faults geometry in the cross-sections based Martínez –Loriente et al., 2013). D. 
Profile PRF-03 shows a SW-NE cross-section drawn along the cluster elongation (TCC- 
Thinned Continental Crust). In this profile, we identify a sub-vertical limit at 60 km from the origin 
(dash-dot). 

We computed the best fitting stress tensor (see Table IV.2), for the determined 
FMs, using the FMSI package (Gephart and Forsyth, 1984). Initially, we 
included all the best focal mechanism solution and subsequently improved the 
dataset by excluding events that were inconsistent with the best tensor solution. 
We started with 16 FMs and an average rotational misfit of 7.95° and concluded 
with 14 FMs and an average rotational misfit of 4.40°.In the next step, we 
subdivided the original focal mechanisms dataset in two sub-groups. This 
approach is coherent with our observations that seismicity distribution along the 
Gorringe cluster is asymmetric. We defined our final stress tensors for the NE 
and SW sub-clusters based on 6 and 7 events with improved average rotational 
misfits of 1.55º and 2.30º, respectively. The ?1 orientation is ? NNW-SSE, 
similar for both SW and NE sub-clusters, differing by approximately 10º in strike 
and dip. In the NE sub-cluster, the lowest compressive direction (?3) dips 
towards ESE, to the thinned continental domain while in the SW sub-cluster, it

dips gently towards WSW. Finally, the SHmax azimuths are nearly NNW-SSE in 
both sub-clusters. According to Zoback (1992) formulation, the Gorringe cluster 
has a dominant strike-slip regime (see Table IV.2 and Fig. IV. 6A).  

IV.5.1.4. The São Vicente Cluster 

The São Vicente seismicity cluster is parallel to the São Vicente Canyon and 
the São Vicente Fault, which terminates near the NE limit of the Horseshoe 
Fault (see Figs. 1B and 7A). The profiles across the cluster long axis show that 
the hypocentres define sub-vertical to SE-dipping trends (see profiles PRF 01 
and 02 in Figs. 7B-C). Hypocenters in the profile PRF01 suggest the existence 
of a sub-vertical discontinuity, while to the SW, in profile PRF02, the seismicity 
distribution displays both vertical and SE-dipping discontinuities. The lower limit 
of the seismogenic layer is at around a depth of 50 km, increasing towards the 
oceanic domain where it reaches depths close to 60 km (PRF03-Fig. IV.7D). 
The depth distribution of the micro-seismicity is in agreement with Grevemeyer 
et al., (2016). 

The prevailing FMs are pure strike-slip and oblique slip, combining strike-slip 
with a small reverse dip-slip component. A few normal faults are also observed.  

The best fitting ?1 orientation is approximately NW-SE, sub-horizontal, oblique 
to the cluster elongation (Table IV.2, Fig. IV. 7). We started with an initial 
dataset of 32 events and an average misfit of 7.937°. The final dataset included 
20 events and the average misfit was 3.836°. It deviates from Geissler et al., 
(2010) preliminary results (which is nearly WNW-ESE). The main difference 
between this work and Geissler et al. (2010) is the dataset, as here we present 
a complete catalogue for the NEAREST experiment. The additional data 
resulted in a different stress tensor model for São Vicente cluster. However, the 
additional data in this work also yields a lower average rotational misfit, of 3.8°, 
while in Geissler et al. (2010) was 4.6°.

WNW–ESE cross-sections are shown in profiles PRF01-02. D. SSW-NNE cross-section is 
presented in profile PRF03. We observe that in profile PRF-01 the hypocenters are mostly 
aligned in a sub-vertical plane while in profiles PRF-02 and PRF03 we can identify ESE and NE 
dipping planes, respectively. The profile PRF-03 is longitudinal to the cluster elongation. In this 
profile, we recognize that the bottom boundary of the hypocentres is located around 50 km 
depth, with rare deeper events (Fault abbreviations and background colors described in Fig. IV. 
1B). 

IV.5.1.5.The Horseshoe Cluster 

The Horseshoe seismicity cluster displays a broad NW-SE trend in epicenter 
distribution (Fig. IV. 8A). The profiles orthogonal to this trend show that 
dispersion is higher to the West (PRF-01, Fig. IV.8B) than in the East (PRF-02, 
Fig. IV.8C). In the longitudinal profile PRF-03, we observe SE-dipping and sub-
vertical alignments of events (Fig. IV. 8D), limited between 20 and 50km depth, 
approximately. This seismicity is distributed across three types of basement, 
two oceanic and one consisting of hydrated mantle. Adding to this, it should be

noted that this profile cross cuts four main discontinuities, three of which are 
first order faults deforming the seafloor the HF, the SWIM 1 and SWIM 2. 
Hypocenters laying to the south of SWIM 1 Fault follow a roughly vertical trend, 
whilst hypocenters to the north of SWIM 1 Fault show a SE dipping trend. 

The focal mechanisms solutions are mostly pure strike-slip and few reverse dip-
slip events, with some normal faulting also. Note that in contrast with the NE-
SW trend of seismicity, most strike-slip solutions show a fault plane striking 
WNW-ESE to W-E, sub-parallel to the SWIM faults (Fig. IV. 8A). These 
observations are clearer in the vicinity of SWIM 1 fault to the East of the 
Horseshoe fault. To the West, FMs are more variable.  

In relation to the stress tensor inversion modeling, we started the Horseshoe 
cluster analysis with 21 the best focal mechanism solutions. The first inversion 
test resulted in an average minimum rotation misfit of 5.96°. We removed 
inconsistent data and end up with 19 events and a misfit of 3.95° (see Table 
IV.2). The resulting maximum compression is similar to Geissler et al. (2010) 
preliminary results for the same area (?1 with orientation 12 °, N351°E, see 
reference work). Yet, divergence is larger for the extensional axis dip that 
is?2°and R solution ?0.7 (idem) contrasting with our results, ?63° and 0.5, 
respectively. We consider that differences result from adding new events to 
initial dataset in Geissler et al (2010).  

To improve our result we tested 2 sub-clusters that we consider coherent with 
our observations of FMs distributions. One sub-cluster to the East of the HF 
where most FMs are clearly strike –slip and another to the W of this fault, where 
FMs have a more complex pattern (Fig. IV. 8A).  

We started with 14 events in the E sub-cluster and a RMS of 6.43. The final 
dataset had 12 events and an average misfit of 3.271. The maximum 
compression is similar to the results previously reported in Geissler et al. 
(2010), roughly NNW-SSE and coincident with the SHmax direction. 

In the W sub-cluster, we selected 5 events and the final error was 1.116°. The 
stress tensor for western dataset is diverges from the remaining results, with ?1 
trend approximately NW-SE sub-parallel to SHmax orientation. This trend is 
also sub-parallel to the SHmax direction in the São Vicente cluster.

IV.5.2. Horseshoe Abyssal Plain tectonic structure 

Several studies have already used depth converted profiles in the same areas 
where we identified the Gorringe and São Vicente seismicity clusters to 
investigate the crustal structure (e.g. Sartori et al., 1994, Zitellini et al., 1999 and 
Jimenez –Munt et al.,2010 and Sallarès et al., 2013). However, this was never 
attempted in the area of the Horseshoe cluster. This cluster straddles across 
various types of oceanic basement as derived from palinspastic reconstructions 
and seismic refraction models (Fig. IV. 1B). The processing, depth conversion 
and interpretation of the MCS profile IAM GB1 (Fig. IV. 1B, 9 and details on

processing in Appendix V), transversal to the Horseshoe cluster, allows a new 
view on the top of the basement morphology and tectonics. In the present 
section, we will present and discuss this seismic profile. 

 The IAM-GB1 seismic profile (Fig. IV.9 and Appendix VI) strikes SW-NE and 
crosses the Eastern Horseshoe Abyssal Plain, intersecting the Horseshoe 
cluster at an oblique angle (see Fig. IV. 8A). The structure and acoustic 
signature of the basement changes along the seismic profile. In the 
southwestern end of the profile up to the CDP 4700 a block-like structured 
basement is observed, similar to the oceanic crust structure reported by Rovere 
et al. (2004) in the profile AR01. On the contrary, to the Northeast, the 
basement morphology is smoother (not suggesting an oceanic crust affinity) 
and cut by several reverse blind faults. Some of these faults possibly 
correspond to the reactivation of extensional structures and affect the overlying 
seismic units (Fig. IV. 9).   

 

 
Figure IV.9 – IAM-GB1 MCS profile with/without interpretation and the projection of the 
horseshoe cluster area. See text for details and Fig. IV. 1B and Fig. IV. 8 for the location of the 
profile. Seismic unit S1-V1 are interpreted as volcaniclastic sequences associated with rift 
episodes, from the Jurassic to the Lower Cretaceous; Seismic unit Cr-Pg (Cretaceous -
Paleogene) are post-rift deep sediments; AUGC is the Allocthonous Unit of the Gulf of Cadiz; 
Seismic unit Mw-Q are Miocene-Quaternary hemi-pelagic sediments and turbidite. Both SWIM1 
and 2 fault are observed. SWIM1 fault is more discrete while SWIM2 fault is associated with a 
wide zone of deformation.  

Above the basement we identified the following seismic units whose calibration 
was based on Hayward et al. (1999) and Roque (2007):

micro-seismicity, high magnitude earthquakes and active faults?

Seismic unit S1-V1 is a basal discontinuous unit mainly filling basement 
depressions. It comprises two seismic sub-units V1 and S1. The first has a 
transparent and low amplitude acoustic signature. Sub-unit S1 is discontinuous 
with internal divergent reflections and with increasing thickness towards SW -
dipping reflectors in the basement. Seismic unit S1-V1 could be related to 
volcaniclastic sequences associated with rift episodes that in this region lasted 
from the Jurassic to the Lower Cretaceous;  

 Seismic unit Cr-Pg (Cretaceous -Paleogene) is characterized by continuous, 
high amplitude and subparallel internal reflections. Locally, between shot points 
100 and 1500 these reflections onlap the basement. Between shot points 1500 
and 4500, seismic unit Cr-Pg covers unconformably the basement. We interpret 
the basal unconformity as the surface marking the end of the oceanic rifting 
episodes. This unit probably consists of deep-sea sediments deposited in a 
post-rift thermally subsiding basin.   

The Allocthonous Unit of the Gulf of Cadiz (AUGC) is characterized by internal 
chaotic reflections. From southwest to the northeast, it becomes more chaotic 
and the internal deformation increases, showing thrust faults dipping to 
northeast. Also the thickness of the AUGC increases towards NE. The AUGC 
was previously described as a succession of gravitational bodies (i.e. 
olistostromes, Torelli et al., 1997, Iribarren et al., 2007) corresponding to 
massive and a rapid succession of from large submarine landslides. Both 
Roque (2007) and Terrinha et al. (2009) based on the internal deformation, 
interpreted this seismic unit as an accretionary wedge. The building up of 
Gorringe and Coral Patch seamounts in the Miocene could also have acted as 
local sources of gravitational deposits that were integrated in the AUGC 
(Roque, 2007 and Iribarren et al., 2007). As the compression increased with the 
Westwards migration of the Betic-Rif arc, the AUGC sequence became more 
deformed and thick (from NE to SW). This sequence is interpreted as being of 
Oligocene-Miocene age. 

Seismic unit Mw-Q (Miocene-Quaternary) shows continuous parallel internal 
reflections with high amplitude and larger thickness in the Southwest sector. 
The lower boundary truncates the underlying sequence. The Mw-Q seismic unit 
is probably related to the deposition of hemi-pelagic sediments and turbidites 
from Miocene through present.  

The Pliocene-Quaternary deformation imaged in the IAM-GB1 is mostly 
localized in Northeast sector and is materialized by a NE-dipping thrust system 
with exception of the zone of intersection with the SWIM1 strike-slip fault in the 
Horseshoe Abyssal Plain. Some of the faults show evidences for early 
extensional kinematics affecting up to the seismic unit Cr-Pg. The basement 
compressive tectonics affect the top of the AUGC. To the Southwest, the SWIM 
1 fault zone, which has been shown to mediate seafloor to basement fluid 
circulation (Hensen et al., 2015) is depicted down to the basement. The cross

cut relationship between these faults and the recent sediments cannot be 
assessed using IAM-GB1 due to its low vertical resolution. However, it has been 
reported by various authors, such as Zitellini et al. (2009). 

The asymmetry in the distribution of the tectonic deformation is coincident with 
morphologic transitions in the basement. The compressive tectonic deformation 
concentrates on i) the limit between crustal oceanic affinity and what is 
presumed to be exhumed continental mantle (Figs. 9 and 12) and ii) the location 
of the Horseshoe seismic cluster.  The discrepancy between oceanic and 
exhumed serpentinized mantle boundaries of this work and Martínez-Loriente et 
al. (2014) are minor and may result from the limited resolution of the available 
data. 

IV.6. Discussion  

IV.6.1.Seismicity clusters and tectonic structures 

In this study we identified three seismicity clusters showing that the micro-
seismic activity is the Gulf of Cadiz is not randomly distributed. The existence of 
these clusters was already revealed in Geissler et al., (2010) and Custódio et 
al., (2016). However, our data allowed a more comprehensive evaluation (i.e. 
larger dataset and lesser errors) of the seismicity distribution showing that 
seismic activity is generated mainly in the lithospheric mantle.  

The São Vicente and Gorringe clusters are elongated parallel to the strike of the 
main thrust faults in the region, which coincide with the strike of the main 
Mesozoic rifting-related extensional faults in the SW Iberia mainland, i.e. NNE-
SSW to NE-SW (Terrinha et al., 2002). The São Vicente cluster is sub-parallel 
to the strike of the São Vicente fault and Marquês de Pombal thrust fault, which 
results from tectonic inversion of a rift fault (Terrinha et al., 2003). The NE-SW 
trending frontal thrust of the Gorringe Bank is parallel, not only to the continental 
crust rifting faults, but also to the oceanic crust extensional fabric described by 
Hayward et al. (1999) and Zitellini et al. (2009), which is well exposed also in 
the Coral Patch Ridge (see Fig. IV.1B for location). The constant strike of the 
Mesozoic rifting faults from the Gorringe seamount to the Gibraltar arc argues 
for a NW-SE extensional direction during Early Jurassic to end of Early 
Cretaceous times, which is compatible with various kinematic reconstructions 
(e.g. Dewey et al., 1989, Schettino and Turco, 2011).  

This strongly suggests that in the Gorringe and São Vicente clusters the mantle 
is responding to the shortening induced by the present day stress field by 
reactivating extensional rift tectonic fabrics in zones of fault intersection, i.e. 
~NE-SW thrusts with ~W-E strike-slip faults. Present day NNE-SSW to NE-SW 
striking faults correspond to reactivation of Mesozoic rift faults, while ~W -E 
striking faults (the SWIM faults) may arise from the reactivation of oceanic 
transfer / rift faults and ocean-continent transition structures associated with the

Tethyan and Atlantic Ocean seafloor expansion. We hypothesize that these 
fault planes in the crust are expressed in the mantle by SE- dipping and vertical 
alignments of hypocenters, respectively (see figs 6-7). 

Beneath the Gorringe Bank most micro-seismicity is located between 20 and 40 
km in depth, below or within the limit of the serpentinized upper mantle (see Fig. 
IV. 10). According to Sallarès et al. (2013), velocity is lower than upper mantle 
values (8.0–8.2km/s) up to ?20 km in depth (see Fig. IV.3 at the referenced 
work). In contrast, some of the intermediate to high magnitude earthquakes are 
located near this limit (see also Fig. IV. 10). This may indicate different seismic 
propagation mechanisms for micro and larger earthquakes as discussed 
elsewhere in this work. 

Note that both higher magnitude and micro-seismicity focal mechanisms show 
reverse dip-slip solutions compatible with a NW-SE strike of Shmax. The 
southeastwards plunge of the ?1 can be interpreted as a deflection from the 
regional sub-horizontal near the Gorringe mantle thrust. The seismicity cannot 
be related to either the HAT fault or the Gorringe Fault as described by 
Martinez-Loriente et al., 2014, 2016 and Sallarès et al, 2013 (see Fig. IV.10). 
The micro-seismicity should be related to a deeper thrust fault zone located 
west of the HAT (see Fig. IV. 10).  

 
Figure IV.10- - Projection of the seismicity across the Gorringe bank along a schematic 
representation of the NRST (NEAREST)-P1 refraction profile (adapted from Sallarès et al., 
2013, location in Fig. IV. 6, colors define the same lithospheric limits as in Fig. IV. 1B).  M&gt;5 
events (open circles) are from Buforn et al.1988 and Stich et al., 2010. Note that the focal 
mechanisms preserve the map view geometry. Few events are coincident with the Gorringe 
Fault. Notwithstanding, the seismicity seems to be related with a replication of this fault in depth 
at upper mantle levels.(1- Gorringe fault from Sallarès et al., 2013 and HAT from Martínez-
Loriente et al., 2014); 2- possible deeper thrust faults, No vertical exaggeration.)

We also speculate that strike-slip focal mechanism in the SW and NE limit of 
the seismicity cluster may be related to E-W to WNW-ESE transfer fault zones 
and OCT (see Fig. IV. 6A). 

The São Vicente cluster is elongated parallel to the Marques de Pombal and the 
São Vicente faults, cutting across the ocean-thinned continental crust boundary 
(see Figs. IV. 7A-D) with prevailing seismicity located between 20 and 40 km 
depth, i.e. in the mantle. The OCT coincides with a sub-vertical alignment of 
hypocenters (see Figs. 7A-D), which suggests that a fault zone extending from 
the crust into the mantle is accommodating brittle displacement in the mantle. 
This is in agreement with the OCT being reactivated as fault zone as suggested 
by Martínez-Loriente et al., (2014). Note that according to our results, the micro-
seismicity in this area cannot be explained by the MPF-BTF system as initially 
postulated in Zitellini et al., (2001, see Fig. IV.11).

(with a projection of the earthquakes located within 20 km of both sides of the profile). On top is 
the interpretation of the AR-10 seismic profile (M- Miocene Unconformity; Cz- Discontinuity 
between the lower Cretaceous and Paleocene; CB-Chaotic body, PRF-03 as is in Fig. IV. 5D). 
On the bottom Marquês de Pombal and Back-Thrust Faults (MPF-BTF) are a simplified 
representation of Zitellini et al. (2001) depth converted AR-10 interpretation. According to 
NEAREST experiment, most micro-seismicity is located off the MPF-BTF system. 

During the NEAREST experiment, the earthquake with the highest magnitude 
(ML=4.8) was located in this cluster. The focal mechanism solution of this event 
(code 78 in Figures 4, 7A and Appendix III.C and IV_C) is strike-slip with a 
small reverse dip-slip component. One of the fault planes is roughly NE-SW, 
subvertical, while the other is a WNW-ESE, a shallower dipping fault dipping 
towards NE (see Fig. IV.4). This FM nearly coincides with the FM solution for 
the December 17th, 2009 Mw=5.8 earthquake, located in the same area and at 
a depth between 36 and 43 km (see Figs. 1C and 4 as well as Appendix III.B

and IV_B). Neither of these events is related to Marques de Pombal or SWIM-
like Faults. We suggest that these events may be related either to a transfer 
zone marking the limit between the North Atlantic and the Tethys oceanic 
domains (considering the vertical fault plane) or to a shallow dipping tectonic 
fabric inherited from the Mesozoic Tethys extension Note that these structures 
are also compatible with the depth location of micro-seismicity and that both 
fabrics (vertical and sub-horizontal) were identified in profiles 1-3 in Figs. 7B-D.  

The epicenters of the Horseshoe seismicity cluster are distributed across the 
Horseshoe Abyssal Thrust, the Horseshoe thrust, the SWIM-1 and SWIM-2 
strike-slip faults and also across three different basement types, Central 
Atlantic, Western Tethys crusts and exhumed serpentinized mantle domain (see 
Fig. IV. 8A-D, Fig. IV.9). This cluster is sub-parallel to the average Shmax 
direction and focal mechanisms are strike-slip (mostly) and thrust. Inspection of 
the hypocenters profiles and IAM GB1 seismic profile suggests that the events 
of this cluster result from the reactivation of all mentioned discontinuities, except 
for the Horseshoe Fault because this thrust is too shallow, with a maximum 
depth of approximately 20 km (see Fig. IV.9 in Martínez-Loriente et al., 2016). 
These results argue in favor of assigning strike-slip events to the SWIM faults, 
which was until present considered an aseismic fault (Figs. 8A, 8D and 12). The 
thrust events can be related to blind thrusts in the mantle lying between the HF 
and the Gorringe thrust (see Fig. IV. 1B).

interpretation see Fig. IV. 9.

micro-seismicity, high magnitude earthquakes and active faults? 

 

231 
 

 

From this work it results that all three seismicity clusters are located in fault 
interference zones. The intersection of faults was shown to be an area of 
stress-strain concentration using analogue and numerical models that were 
used to investigate fault interference in the study area (see Rosas et al., 2012). 
The map of lithospheric domains by Martínez-Loriente et al. (2014) suggests 
that some of the fault interference zones of the study area are associated with 
the boundaries of different lithospheric domains. Although crustal faults are 
active and coincident with these boundaries zones, they are too shallow to 
generate the seismicity recorded in NEAREST experiment, mostly located 
between 30 km and 50 km in depth. Instead, this seismic activity could be 
related to the replication at depth of this shallower fabric into the upper mantle 
controlled by the 3D localization of these tectonic-rheological boundaries (Figs. 
3, 6-9).  

IV.6.2.Aseismic-seismic slip 

In what concerns fault slip and fault seismicity in the study area, four points 
must be highlighted, firstly, there are major thrusts and strike-slip faults imaged 
in the sediments and basement with accumulated slip that can exceed 1.5km in 
the Pliocene-Quaternary; secondly, seismicity clusters do not coincide with 
thrust prolongation in depth, thirdly, there is barely any seismicity in the crust, 
i.e. it occurs predominately in the mantle regardless of the different lithospheric 
domains (Fig. IV. 13); fourthly, there is both historical and instrumental 
evidences for events M~8 or larger. 

For example, the western part of the Horseshoe seismicity cluster is located off 
to the west of the footwall of the Horseshoe fault at a depth of ?30 km, which is 
not compatible with the prolongation in depth of this fault that detaches at 15-20 
km of depth. Nonetheless, the Horseshoe Fault accumulated ~1.0 km of slip 
during the Pliocene-Quaternary (Gràcia et al., 2003, Zitellini et al., 2004, 
Terrinha et al., 2009 and Martínez-Loriente et al., 2016).  

Considering that displacement is either accommodated by stick-slip and/or by 
creep, understanding the transition between these two mechanisms can be 
important to find the possible link between active faults, high magnitude 
earthquakes and micro-seismicity in the study area. 

Serpentinization may be a controlling mechanism of seismic to aseismic slip 
partitioning, as described in different tectonic settings by Guillot et al. (2015). 
Reinen et al. (1994) experiments with serpentinite materials at shallow depth 
indicate that only fault creep can occur at typical rates of plate motion. 
According to these authors, serpentinized areas do not favor seismicity but will 
promote local weakening allowing seismic slip to propagate into a serpentinized 
region.

Figure IV.13- Earthquakes distribution in depth for the three identified clusters. The absence (or 
low) of seismicity in the crust is clearly illustrated here. This is transversal to the all clusters and 
lithospheric domains (the depth scale refers to the sea level). Note that seismicity is located 
mostly below the serpentinization limit 

 

Knowing that the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain sediments are floored by a 
serpentized layer at least down to 20 km in depth (Sallarès et al., 2013 and 
Martínez-Loriente et al., 2014) we should consider the rheology of serpentine 
when interpreting the seismicity clusters. Serpentinization can have two origins, 
i) a primary one during mantle exhumation at the formation of the oceanic crust 
and ii) a secondary one associated to fracturing and deep sea water circulation 
(Rosas et al., 2012 and Hensen et al.,2015). 

Another side effect of aseismic deformation is the increase of pore fluid 
pressure due to local tectonic compaction on the surrounding rocks. Pore fluid 
pressure buildup promotes frictional slip at comparatively lower shear strains 
producing cracking and porosity in the fault zone promoting fluid circulation. A 
new group of mud volcanoes reported by Hensen et al. (2015) in the Horseshoe 
- SWIM faults interference zone occurs above the Horseshoe seismicity cluster. 
Fluid signatures show a mixed pattern between minor clay dehydration, 
carbonates recrystallization and oceanic crust alteration that is explained by 
upward fluids migration suggesting that strike-slip faults provide pathways for 
deep-seated fluids.  



IV. Micro-seismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz. Is there a link between  
micro-seismicity, high magnitude earthquakes and active faults? 

 

233 
 

Co-seismic dehydration of serpentinite can be a key mechanism in fault 
weakening during a high-velocity frictional slip occurring during large magnitude 
events (Lin et al., 2013). Frictional heating of serpentine-rich fault zones during 
these events can thus lead to the release of large amounts of water vapor, 
resulting in increase of pore pressure, decrease of the effective stresses, i.e. 
weakening of fault zones and fluid migration into neighbor faults promoting extra 
slip. The transition from creep to stick-slip behaviors in fault zones due to 
dynamic weakening mechanism is used to explain unexpected high rupture 
patterns in subduction zones such as the 1999, Mw 7.6 Chi-Chi earthquake 
(Noda and Lapusta, 2013). The same authors refer this as a plausible rupture 
mechanism also in other geodynamic settings such as major strike-slip fault like 
San Andreas Fault.  

Micro-seismicity can be used as a proxy for the deep limit of the seismogenic 
zone. A gap of micro-seismicity can also indicate ductile recovery after a large 
magnitude event. According to Jiang and Lapusta (2016) this is an explanation 
for the absence of micro-seismicity at in the area of the 1857 Mw 7.9 Fort Tejon 
earthquake on the San Andreas/San Jacinto faults system and seismically 
quiescent megathrusts such as the Cascadia subduction zone.  

During 1755-like events the rupture area can extend down to 90 km in depth 
(Matias et al., 2013), below the seismogenic zone for a Jurassic oceanic 
lithosphere. We hypothesize that the micro-seismicity gap on the HF (between 
the Horseshoe and São Vicente clusters) can eventually be the result of ductile 
recovery that followed this event. 

Based on the above it is suggested that:  

- The existence of the serpentinized layer results in a decoupling between the 
crustal and upper mantle tectonics. Accordingly, the serpentinization level 
should accounts for the absence or scarcity of seismicity above 15km. 

- High magnitude events will propagate from upper mantle into crustal levels 
across the serpentinized layer inducing superficial rupture. In contrast, present-
day micro-seismicity is mainly restricted to the upper mantle (Figure IV.13 ). 

- The large magnitude events (M&gt;8) can propagate the slip both up and 
downwards, i.e. into and across the serpentinized layer as well as into and 
across brittle-ductile boundary and disturbing the lithosphere-asthenosphere 
boundary (Figure IV.14).

domains, with low to intermediate magnitude seismicity (red circles) distribution, tectonic slip 
distribution (white arrows) and fault kinematics (black arrows). Micro-seismicity is constrained 
between two aseismic slip layers, between 15 and 50 km in depth (see the histogram with the 
depth distribution of the events from the Gorringe and the horseshoe clusters). A top is limited 
by the serpentinization layer and at the bottom by the brittle-ductile transition zone. During a 
large magnitude earthquake (black star) the rupture area propagates both upwards and 
downwards, i.e. slip propagates into the upper crust faults showing surface rupture or not (blind 
faults). For a 1755-like event extend below the limit of the seismogenic zone down to 90 km in 
depth.  

IV.7. Conclusion 

The main conclusions of this work are:  

We identified three seismicity clusters located in the areas of the Gorringe 
Bank, São Vicente Canyon and along the Horseshoe Abyssal plain showing 
that seismicity is not uniformly distributed in the Gulf of Cadiz area also as 
suggested by NEAREST preliminary results (Geissler et al., 2010) and 
clustering analysis in Custódio et al, (2016); 

The three seismicity clusters characterized in this work show that the present 
day micro-seismic activity is generated in the lithospheric mantle and 
concentrates at fault’s intersections, suggesting that the crustal fabric may be 
replicated in the lithospheric mantle;  

The inferred fault interference zones in the upper mantle are associated with 
boundaries of lithospheric domains localizing stress and seismic strain; 

Active crustal faults with bathymetric expression, such as the Horseshoe and 
Marquês de Pombal faults are either locked or move through slow aseismic slip. 
Frictional slip may only result from high magnitude earthquakes;  

Serpentinization controls seismicity distribution by inducing tectonic decoupling 
and inhibiting micro-seismicity to occur above the serpentinized layer. Only 
during high-magnitude events it is expected seismic rupture to propagate 
upwards across the serpentinized layer up to the surface.  

Slip propagation from a non-serpentinized mantle into serpentinized mantle is a 
possible mechanism to produce larger slip areas, due to the release of pore 
fluid pressure accumulated during previous aseismic events. This mechanism 
can account for larger than expected slip for a high magnitude earthquake, like

it is assumed for the 1755 event from numerical modelling of tsunami and 
inundation (Johnston, 1996, Gradin et al., 2007, Baptista et al.1998, 2011).

V. Discussion and conclusion  

The results of the present study allow for the discussion of the following topics: 

Our study started with the following main objectives: 

? origin and characterization of the micro-seismicity in the study area; 

? slip distribution in the active faults,  

? what mechanisms control seismicity distribution;  

? strain partitioning mechanisms; 

? the plate boundary position in the area.  

In this final chapter we will sum up and discuss our findings in the scope of the 
proposed objectives and point out possible future work. 

V.1.The micro-seismicity in the study area 

The micro-seismicity distribution in the Gulf of Cadiz was studied based on the 
data recorded in 11 months temporary deployment of 25 ocean-bottom seismic 
network. The initial dataset included 746 events recorded in ? 3 stations. From 
those, 590 events are located in the restricted area of the NEAREST network as 
defined by external envelope of the stations locations. Events locations were 
improved and tested using different methodologies. The final location results 
from the simultaneous inversion of a 1D velocity model including stations 
corrections to incorporate sub-surface geological variability (details in chapter 
III). 

The micro-seismicity concentrates in the upper mantle (between 30 and 50 km 
in depth) in the 3 following clusters, the Gorringe Bank, the São Vicente Canyon 
and in the vicinity of SWIM 1 and Horseshoe Fault, the Horseshoe cluster. The 
remaining seismicity was mostly located below the Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary, 
the Portimão bank, and Guadalquivir bank. It is worthwhile noting that the depth 
distribution of the hypocentres is common to all clusters regardless the 
lithospheric domain.  

The three clusters are also the loci of intermediate and large magnitude 
earthquakes. The Horseshoe cluster hosted the Mw=7.8, 28th of February 1969 
(the highest magnitude instrumental event in the area) and the Mw ? 6.0, 12th of

17th December earthquake with Mw=5.5. The Gorringe cluster is coincident with 
Mw?4.5 events, in 19th of July and 29th of August 2005. Note that all clusters are 
also located in the vicinity of major active faults.

well constrained solutions. Most events indicate a reverse (21%) and strike-slip 
solutions (32%). In the São Vicente cluster, the dominant fault plane solutions 
were strike- or oblique slip. In the Gorringe cluster, we had mostly reverse and 
oblique slip. While the Horseshoe cluster and the area of the accretionary 
wedge showed mostly reverse and strike-slip solutions. 

The stress tensor inversion showed a NW-SE maximum compression in the 
Western Horseshoe sub-cluster, the São Vicente cluster and the SW Gorringe 
sub-cluster and nearly NNW-SSE in the Eastern Horseshoe and the NE 
Gorringe sub-clusters. These results, in general, diverge from Geissler et al., 
2010 preliminary results. In the São Vicente cluster (Northern cluster in the 
reference work) is referred a maximum compression nearly WNW-ESE, while in 
the Horseshoe cluster (southern cluster in the reference paper) is roughly NNE-
SSW. Some discrepancies with Geissler et al. (2010) probably arise from the 
fact that the present study added 33 new focal mechanism solutions to the 
catalogue.  

The maximum horizontal compression (SHmax) and dominant stress regime 
based on the stress tensor details for each cluster was calculated following the 
World Stress Map Project guidelines. 

In the São Vicente cluster, SHmax is roughly NW-SE, at ?50º angle with the 
NNE-SSW cluster striking direction. The dominant stress regime is strike-slip, in 
agreement with prevailing focal mechanisms solutions. 

In the Horseshoe cluster, SHmax is roughly NNW-SSE in the E and NW-SE in 
the W. In the E, SHmax defines a ~50º angle with the main SWIM strike-slip 
fault, the expected maximum compression direction on a strike-slip fault. 
Conversely, in the W, SHmax direction is perpendicular to the Horseshoe thrust 
fault, consistent with the thrust kinematics and sub-parallel to the cluster 
alignment. Nevertheless, both sub-clusters have a strike-slip dominant stress 
regime compatible with the E FMs solutions but unclearly explained in the 
Western domain. 

The Gorringe cluster SHmax is roughly NNW-SSE oriented, defining a high 
angle (70º-75º) with the Gorringe fault strike, compatible with thrust kinematics. 
However the dominant stress regime is strike–slip, as the prevailing FMs are 
mostly oblique, combining strike-slip with reverse-slip. 

All the above SHmax orientations are in reasonable agreement with SHmax 
determination derived from neotectonic numerical modeling in the area of Neres 
et al. (2016) that used GPS plate kinematics, potential fields and seismic strain. 
This agreement from independent approaches is interpreted as a validation of 
the methodology used in the present work 

V.2.Lithospheric domains and the limits of the seismogenic zone 

It is argued in this work that micro-seismicity provides valuable information 
about the limits of seismogenic zone based on the following.

One of the main results of this work is the comprehensive understanding of 
depth limit of low to intermediate magnitude earthquakes in the study area. 
Using 1 D velocity model to define EQs hypocentres in areas with high 
lithospheric variability such as the Gulf of Cadiz was overcome with stations 
corrections in our location models. Different locations methods and velocity 
models to control the depth variability were tested.  

According to our results all EQ events are located in the upper mantle with 
maximum depths of 50-55 km. This observation is common to all clusters 
regardless of the lithospheric transitions and composition.  

The lower limit for cold Jurassic oceanic lithosphere seismogenic zone or brittle-
ductile transition is roughly between 50 and 55 km, coinciding with the ?600ºC 
geotherm, for simple temperature dependent models (e.g. Mackenzie et al, 
2005), which is also the transition between velocity weakening - velocity 
strengthening behaviors of dry olivine (Boettcher et al., 2007). More 
comprehensive models of the oceanic lithosphere (combining temperature-
pressure-dependent thermal properties, hydrothermal circulation and oceanic 
crust contributions) set this limit to 700ºC-800ºC (Grose et al., 2013), also at 50-
55 km depth. 

It is known that in continental lithosphere seismicity is also restricted to 
temperatures below 600ºC (e.g. Sloan et al, 2010). However, the upper mantle 
is generally above 600ºC (e.g Mckenzie et al., 2005), thus usually seismicity 
occurs in the crust within continental lithosphere.  

At continental margins, seismic activity can display a combination of the 
seismogenic behaviour of both continental and oceanic settings (Craig et al., 
2011), such as for eastern and north-eastern African margins where seismicity 
extends below the expected depth for the typical continental lithosphere but not 
below the seismogenic limit at the adjacent old oceanic lithosphere. The authors 
argue that this is due to a compositional transition between the two types of 
lithosphere. 

The existence of seismicity in the continental upper mantle in the Gulf of Cadiz 
was reported by several previous studies based on teleseismic records (e.g 
Stich et al., 2010) and in local temporary deployments (Geissler et la., 2010, 
Grevemeyer et., 2016 in attachment)  

Let us assume a simple model where seismicity in the continental lithosphere is 
limited by the 600ºC isotherm. To explore this thermal limit in the Gulf of Cadiz, 
we created simplified geothermal gradient models, as follows. We combined 
heat flow measurements with stratified geological models of the lithosphere 
(deduced from geophysical and core data, Hayes et al., 1972, Ryan et al., 1973 
Gonzalez et al. (1996), Rovere et al., (2004), Sallarès et al. (2011) and 
Martínez-Loriente et al. (2014)). The conductive geotherm in a horizontally 
stratified subsurface is calculated by solving the steady state heat flow equation

The heat flow data was extracted from Grevemeyer et al. (2009, 2017) and 
Jimenez –Munt et al. (2010). We used the thermal proprieties in Fernandez et 
al, (1998), Watts and Burov (2003), Vilá et al. (2010) and Grevemeyer et al., 
(2017). 

We defined the following different layered models to compare with the local 
setting of the three clusters: 

? a three layer model to simulate the exhumed serpentinized mantle 
domain (details in the Table V.1): sediments, hydrated mantle and 
unaltered mantle; 

? four layered model to describe the oceanic lithosphere domain (details in 
the Table V.2)  

? five layered model to define the thinned continental lithospheric 
domains: sediments, upper crust, lower crust, hydrated mantle and 
unaltered mantle (details in the Table V.3). 

We consider that all layers have isotropic and homogeneous thermal properties 
and heat production. 

The exhumed serpentinized mantle domain: 

In the exhumed mantle models we explored two initial surface heat flow (SHF) 
values 60.7 and 65 mW/m2 and two sediments thickness, 0.5 and 4 km. These 
values reflect the heat flow data observed in the vicinity of Gorringe bank and in 
Horseshoe Abyssal plain (HAP) area (within the exhumed mantle domain, 
Grevemeyer et al., 2017 and Jimenez-Munt et al., 2010). Also both MCS 
reflection and refraction seismic profiles (e.g. Jimenez-Munt et al., 2010 and 
Martinez-Loriente et al., 2013) show that the sediments thickness in the GB is ? 
0.5 km while in the HAP is nearly 4km (see Figure V.1A). We limited the

serpentinization level to 20 km in depth as observed P1-NEAREST refraction 
profile (Martinez et al., 2013). 

Our models are plotted in the Figure V.1B. Initial higher SHF values and thicker 
sediment cover lead to hotter models (red lines). Note that having a thin 
sediment cover with higher SHF (full red line in Figure V.1B) and thick sediment 
cover with lower SHF (dashed blue line in Figure V.1B) leads to similar thermal 
models. Our models plot the 600ºC geotherm between 46-53 km in depth (45-
52 km below sea floor) in the Gorringe Bank (see Figure V.1A and full line 
models in Figure V.1B) and between 45-50km in the HAP (see Figure V.1A and 
dashed line models in Figure V.1B).  

The highest SHF values are observed in the vicinity of the Gorringe Bank and 
decreases towards the East, in HAP (e.g. Jimenez-Munt et al., 2010). We may 
consider that the model with the thinner sediment cover and highest SHF (full 
red line in Figure V.1B) is more adequate to define the SW Gorringe sub-cluster 
setting while the 4 km thick sediment cover with lower SHF value fits the W 
HAP sub-cluster. 

Our results show that seismicity in the SW Gorringe sub-cluster (to the left in 
Figure V.1A) is located above the 600ºC limit. This is observed even if we 
consider a hotter model, with SHF?65 mW/m2 (red full line in Figure V.1B). 
However, in the HAP cluster, 3 events are located below this thermal limit if we 
consider SHF of 65 mW/m2.   

Another interesting result is that 8 events in the SW Gorringe sub-cluster and 3 
events in the W HAP sub-clusters are located in the serpentinized mantle. 
Accordingly, it may indicate that seismicity may be also generated in the 
partially serpentinized layer or alternatively, that serpentinization may be 
heterogeneously distributed both in Gorringe bank and HAP.  

However, these results should be taken with caution as the the average depth 
errors are 5.7km and 7.7km in the SW Gorringe sub-cluster and W HAP sub-
cluster, respectively, and, as we can observe in Figure V.1C, the Vp and Vs 
velocity models used to located the NEAREST dataset do not reflect the 
compositional models of these two sub-clusters.

The oceanic lithosphere domain 

We tested two models simulating the lithospheric layering in the southern limit 
of the SVC and in the western HAP sub-cluster. The main differences are the 
sediment and crustal thickness (see Table V.2 and Figure V.2A-C). Both 
models had a SHF of 57mW/m2, in agreement with the values in Grevemeyer et 
al. (2009) and Jimenez-Munt et al. (2010). The velocity model resulted from 
hypocenter-velocity inversion method (Figure V.2C). 

Our results are plotted in the Figure V.2 B. The 600°C isotherm is located 
between 47 and 50 km in depth. Thinner sediment and thicker crustal layers 
result in a relatively hotter model. One hypocenter in the Horseshoe sub-cluster 
and 5 in the southern limit of SVC were located below this limit (Figure V.2A). 
Like in the previous models some events are located in the hydrated mantle 
domain. The average depth error is 5.3km in the western HAP sub-cluster and 
6km in the southern SVC.  

We consider that our results indicated that the selected thermal models 
describe the lithospheric structure in the two sub-clusters.

The thinned continental lithosphere domain 

We initially tested two different models to describe the thermal model in the NE 
limit of the Gorringe and the N limit of the São Vicente clusters, located in the 
thinned continental lithospheric domain (see Figure V.4 based on Rovere et al., 
2004, Gonzalez et al., 1996, Sallarès et al., 2011 and Martinez-Loriente et al., 
2013). The thermal proprieties and layering are presented in the Table V.3. We 
considered a surface heat flow of 59mW/m2 based on values described for the 
Marques de Pombal Fault area, after topography correction, in Grevemeyer et 
al., (2009). According to the authors, the MPF tectonic activity has low influence 
on the surface heat flow value.  

In the Gorringe cluster area, the model was 11km thick for both the continental 
crust (upper and lower crust) and the serpentinized mantle. In the São Vicente 
cluster area, we considered 17km and 7km thick for the crust and hydrated 
mantle, respectively (Table V.3. and Figure V.3A).These values were taken 
from analysis of Sallarés et al 2011 and Rovere et al. 2004.  

Our models show that the 600°C limit is located at 39 km and 45km in the São 
Vicente and Gorringe sub-clusters, respectively (Figure V.3A-B). Based on 
these results, 5 earthquakes, in the Gorringe Sub-cluster, are located below this 
limit although within the depth error limit (5.2km). In the northern São Vicente 
area 65 events lie below the 600ºC isothermal, 15 of which below the error limit 
(5.6 km) 

The results indicate that assumed thermal models reasonably fit the Gorringe 
bank compositional layering. However, it may fail to reproduce the lithospheric 
structuring in the northern São Vicente sub-cluster. We point out the following 
hypotheses: 

a)  Incorrect layered model? 

The selected number of layers agrees with the information provided by 
geophysical data (wide-angle seismic reflection and refraction profiles in 
Gonzalez et al., 1996 and Sallarès et al., 2011). However, there is some 
uncertainty in the thickness of selected layers particularly in the crustal levels. 
Our tests showed that any increase in the crustal thickness moved the 600ºC 
isotherm into shallow levels, increasing the number of events below this 
rheological limit. Decreasing the crustal thickness would not agree with 
constraints imposed by the available geophysical data.  

b) Inadequate velocity model? 

We should also discuss if our general velocity model is adequate to define the 
compositional model in the northern São Vicente sub-cluster. In Figure V.3C, 
we see that the general model is in roughly faster than the thinned continental 
layering in both NE Gorringe and Northern SVC. Some of these differences 
should be absorbed by stations corrections included in the location method. 



V. Discussion and conclusion 
 

245 
 

c)The thermal proprieties are inaccurate? 

The heat production and thermal conductivity in the models are mostly 
extracted from the Vilà et al., (2010). Since both areas are at a continental 
margin, we considered that the crust was more mafic with lower heat 
production. So, we slightly increase the heat production to 9.80E-07W/m3 and 
3.70E-07W/m3 in the upper and lower crust, respectively. Accordingly, the 
600ºC isotherm moved down to 49km in depth (blue full line in B and see details 
in the Table V.3). As a result few hypocentres were located below this depth 
limit (Figure V.3A). 

In general thermal models are in good agreement depth distribution of the 
hypocentres. For all, selected areas seismicity is mostly located above the 
600ºC limit. This is the typical temperature limit at the oceanic domain.  

At the continental domain seismicity is mostly located at the crust. Our results 
show that hypocentres, in continental domain are mostly located at the upper 
mantle, but above the 600ºC isotherm.  

These results also attest the adequacy of the earthquakes location method 
applied in our study.

V.3.Seismicity and the active faults in the Gulf of Cadiz 

Seismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz area is located at intermediate depth (mostly 30-
50km) below the limits of observation for MCS seismic and refraction profiles. 
However, keeping in mind these limitations, we can still compare geological 
patterns and crustal transitions observed at shallow depth with the hypocenters 
trends and fault-plane solutions derived from our seismological data. 

Both the Gorringe and the São Vicente clusters define alignments sub-parallel 
to the striking direction of major active ~NE-SW striking thrust faults and 
associated seamounts.  

In the Gorringe cluster, seismicity is aligned sub-parallel to the Gorringe Fault 
that limits to NW, the Gorringe Bank. According to Jiménez-Munt et al. (2010), 
this fault is a major NW verging, sub-crustal thrust fault with a ramp and flat 
geometry related with at least 20 km shortening in the 5-10 Ma interval (upper-
middle Miocene). Sallarès et al. (2013) also identified a low angle SE-dipping, 
high serpentinization zone resulting as an additional evidence for the presence 
of a major thrust fault.  

The prevailling FMs in the area are strike-slip and reverse dip-slip both for ML?3 
recorded in the NEAREST experiment and higher magnitude earthquakes 
compiled from permenent land networks (see Figure V.4). However, none of 
these are related to the Gorringe Fault as inferred from MCS seismic profiles 
since this is too shallow in the crust. Seismicity should be related to a deeper 
structure. However, it is puzzling that only two events with ML?3 have reverse 
dip-slip solutions, the remaining earthquakes show nearly pure strike-slip 
solutions, with fault plane solutions striking ?N-S to NNE-SSW and ? E-W to 
NW-SE. This is also in agreement with the dominant stress regime in Neres et 
al, (2016) or estimations based on the only on NEAREST dataset (even though 
it refers to low to intermediate magnitude events).

compression, full black lines define active faults, dashed lines are inferred or possible 
active faults, white lines are blind faults and blue line is the PIAB- Paleo Iberia-Africa 
plate Boundary, from Rovere et al., 2004). 

The Gorringe seamount comprehends the intersection of the NW-SE trending 
OCT, the NE-SW striking Gorringe thrust and the western prolongation of the 
~W-E striking strike-slip SWIM faults. It appears that all these tectonic faults and 
discontinuities are being reactivated generating micro-seismicity in the shallow 
lithospheric mantle (figure V.1). 

The São Vicente cluster of epicentres is at the intersection of NNE-SSW to NE-
SW striking thrust faults (S. Vicente canyon fault and Marquês de Pombal 
thrust) and one WNW-ESE striking SWIM strike-slip fault that is coincident with 
the Ocean-Continent Transition. 



V. Discussion and conclusion 
 

249 
 

The MP thrust fault soling out at approximately 20 km of depth was described 
as a good candidate to the 1755 earthquake source, combined either with a 
Back-Thrust Fault (BTF- Zitellini et al., 2001) system or with Horseshoe Fault 
(Ribeiro et al, 2006). However, these faults are too shallow to account for the 
recorded micro-seismicity.  

Recent earthquakes with magnitude &gt;4, (e.g. 17th December 2009 event with 
Mw?5.5) and also the highest magnitude event recorded in NEAREST network 
with ML=4.8 are located in this cluster. Both resulted from similar FMs, oblique 
solution combining strike-slip with reverse dip-slip component (Figure V.4). One 
of the fault planes is roughly NE-SW, sub-vertical, while the other is a WNW-
ESE, a shallower dipping fault dipping towards NE. Neither of these events is 
also related to Marques de Pombal or SWIM-like Faults.  

Alternatively, the first fault plane is sub-parallel to the SVF, that strikes ?NE-SW 
steeply dipping to the SE. In Pereira and Alves (2013) is described as the 
possible offshore extension of the Messejana-Plasencia Fault Zone (MPFZ) 
more than 400 km long hosting a dolerite dyke with tens of meters of thickness, 
indicating a deep origin of this fault. The other fault plane is may be related to a 
shallow dipping tectonic fabric inherited from the Mesozoic Tethys extension. 

Hence it is proposed that the NE-SW striking steep faults (S. Vicente fault 
system) and the SWIM strike-slip faults and sub-parallel OCT accommodate 
earthquake slip and strain partitioning in the S. Vicente seismicity cluster. 

In the Horseshoe cluster seismicity is distributed along a NW-SE alignment, 
sub-parallel to the transition between exhumed serpentinized mantle or of 
Western Tethys domains and the Central Atlantic oceanic crust. It is also on the 
tail of the Gorringe thrust and extends to the East across the intersection of the 
Horseshoe thrust and SWIM faults (Figure V.4). This cluster contains the source 
area of 28th February 1969 earthquake with Ms?8.0, located at 22-33km in 
depth, the largest instrumental event reported in the Gulf of Cadiz region. Again, 
the NEAREST dataset also reported an event located with ML?3.9, in the same 
area, at the same depth with similar FMs (event 53, Figure V.4). The events are 
located on top or at the footwall of the HAT but vertically displaced from this 
structure. To the East is the source area of the 12 February 2007 had Mw ? 6.0, 
with a hypocenter at 40 km beneath the seafloor and a moment tensor 
indicating thrust faulting with a small component of strike slip (Figure V.4).   

In this cluster, the prevailing FMs are: a) nearly pure reverse dip-slip solution to 
the west of the HAT; b) pure strike-slip solutions to the East of the Horseshoe 
fault or in the vicinity of the SWIM faults system; c) oblique slip (combining 
strike-slip with reverse dip-slip) on top of the Horseshoe Fault and the 
interference zone with the SWIM fault system. Accordingly, we speculate that 
the fault zones imaged at crustal levels may be the expression of similar 
structures in the mantle, here replicated by distribution of the focal mechanism 
solutions.  



Strain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate 
boundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia

From the NEAREST experiment results that all three seismicity clusters are 
located in fault interference zones. The map of lithospheric domains by 
Martinez-Loriente et al. (2014) suggests that the fault interference zones of the 
area are also associated with the boundaries of different lithospheric domains. 
Although crustal faults are active and coincident with these interference zones 
they are too shallow to generate the seismicity recorded in NEAREST 
experiment. Instead, this seismic activity can be related to the replication of this 
shallow tectonic fabric into the upper mantle controlled also by the location of 
these lithospheric transitions.  

Outside the NEAREST network area, the earthquakes identification and location 
become less accurate. However, we could recover some events and define a 
few focal mechanism solutions. In Figure V.5, we show the events locations in 
map view and projected along the P2 NEAREST refraction profile, respectively.  

Few events are located in the upper crust at the continental domain. Outside 
this area, seismicity is restricted to the upper mantle below 20 km in depth. As 
in the Gorringe cluster, it seems that in the South Portuguese continental 
margin the hypocenters distribution dip to the N, following the continental-ocean 
boundary zone slope (see Figure V.5). The relation between the bending 
stresses associated with flexural isostasy in the OCT and seismicity distribution 
in the Gulf of Cadiz was already explored in Neves and Neves (2009). However, 
the authors suggest that flexure bending stress is not sufficient to produce brittle 
failure and earthquakes in the crust and upper mantle. An additional weakening 
mechanism is necessary to reduce the brittle strength in the ocean–continent 
transition. They suggest inherited mechanical weaknesses as a possible 
additional mechanism. 

Focal mechanisms show mostly strike-slip and reverse-slip solutions, 
compatible with SWIM and thrust faults kinematics. However, the reverse-slip 
solutions are located at mantle depths, displaced by 30 km from the 
accretionary wedge limit. Accordingly, these focal mechanisms are 
speculatively associated with a deeper thrust fault that is compatible with the 
east-dipping subduction zone under the Gibraltar arc described in Gutscher et 
al. 2002 and Duarte et al., 2013.

V.4.Strain partitioning, aseismic and seismic slip:  

Strain partitioning in the Gulf of Cadiz is described in previous works. Terrinha 
et al. (2009) based on swath bathymetry and MCS seismics suggested that the 
present day NW-wards movement of Nubia with respect to Iberia is 
accommodated by strain partitioning in dextral wrenching on WNW–ESE 
trending steep faults and thrusting on the NE–SW trending fault.  

Our study shows that micro-seismicity results from fault plane solutions with 
prevailing strike-slip and reverse dip-slip kinematics. This is common to the 
three clusters. Hence, it may indicate that seismic strain is partitioned in two 
fault systems with the similar striking directions to the crustal structures. Yet, 
seismicity is located at intermediate depths in the upper lithospheric mantle 
suggesting a tectonic pattern and strain partitioning mechanism similar to the 
one described for the shallow crust replicated in the uppermost mantle. 

If micro-seismicity is, detached from the crustal thrusts, how does slip 
accumulate/propagate in crustal thrusts? Are high magnitude earthquakes also 
generated in mantle faults? In Figure V.4, we plotted the focal mechanism and

moment tensors with M?3 recorded in the NEAREST network (in black) and in 
the permanent land networks (in red). Most events are located &gt;20km in depth 
and the shallower events are mostly strike-slip solutions. For M?5, the fault 
plane solutions show oblique motion, combining reverse dip-slip with strike-slip. 
According to geological interpretation in the chapter IV, none of these events 
could be related to the crustal faults.   

Previous works have described the crustal faults systems to be active. For 
example, the Horseshoe Fault accumulated ~1.0 km of slip during the Pliocene-
Quaternary (Gràcia et al., 2003, Zitellini et al., 2004, Terrinha et al., 2009 and 
Martínez-Loriente et al., 2016). Note that displacement in active faults is either 
accommodated by stick-slip and/or by creep. The transition between these two 
mechanisms is largely dependent on the characteristic of the fault zone, such 
as frictional proprieties (e,g Sholz, 1998). 

Serpentinization may be a controlling mechanism of seismic to aseismic slip 
partitioning, as described in different tectonic settings by Guillot et al. (2015). 
Reinen et al. (1994) experiments with serpentinite materials at shallow depth 
indicate that only fault creep can occur at typical rates of plate motion. 
According to these authors, serpentinized areas do not favor seismicity but will 
promote local weakening allowing seismic slip to propagate into a serpentinized 
region. 

Knowing that to the W of the HAT, the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain sediments are 
floored by a serpentinized layer at least down to 20 km in depth (Sallarès et al., 
2013 and Martínez-Loriente et al., 2014) we should consider the rheology of 
serpentine when interpreting the seismicity clusters. Serpentinization can have 
two origins, i) a primary one during mantle exhumation at the formation of the 
oceanic crust and ii) a secondary one associated to fracturing and deep sea 
water circulation (Rosas et al., 2012 and Hensen et al.,2015 Silva et al., in 
press, in chapter IV). 

Another side effect of aseismic deformation is the increase of pore fluid 
pressure due to local tectonic compaction on the surrounding rocks. Pore fluid 
pressure build up promotes frictional slip at comparatively lower shear strains 
producing cracking and porosity in the fault zone promoting fluid circulation. A 
new group of mud volcanoes reported by Hensen et al. (2015) in the Horseshoe 
- SWIM faults interference zone occurs above the Horseshoe seismicity cluster. 
Fluid signatures show a mixed pattern between minor clay dehydration, 
carbonates recrystallization and oceanic crust alteration that is explained by 
upward fluids migration suggesting that strike-slip faults provide pathways for 
deep-seated fluids.  

Co-seismic dehydration of serpentinite can be a key mechanism in fault 
weakening during a high-velocity frictional slip occurring during large magnitude 
events (Lin et al., 2013). Frictional heating of serpentine-rich fault zones during

these events can thus lead to the release of large amounts of water vapor, 
resulting in increase of pore pressure, decrease of the effective stresses, i.e. 
weakening of fault zones and fluid migration into neighbor faults promoting extra 
slip. The transition from creep to stick-slip behaviors in fault zones due to 
dynamic weakening mechanism is used to explain unexpected high rupture 
patterns in subduction zones such as the 1999, Mw 7.6 Chi-Chi earthquake 
(Noda and Lapusta, 2013). The same authors refer this as a plausible rupture 
mechanism also in other geodynamic settings such as major strike-slip fault like 
San Andreas Fault.  

Micro-seismicity can be used as a proxy for the deep limit of the seismogenic 
zone. A gap of micro-seismicity can also indicate ductile recovery after a large 
magnitude event. According to Jiang and Lapusta (2016) this is an explanation 
for the absence of micro-seismicity in the area of the 1857 Mw 7.9 Fort Tejon 
earthquake on the San Andreas/San Jacinto faults system and seismically 
quiescent megathrusts such as the Cascadia subduction zone.  

During 1755-like events the rupture area can extend down to 90 km in depth 
(Matias et al., 2013), below the seismogenic zone for a Jurassic oceanic 
lithosphere. We hypothesize that the micro-seismicity gap on the HF (between 
the Horseshoe and São Vicente clusters) can eventually be the result of ductile 
recovery that followed this event. 

Based on the above it is suggested that:  

- The existence of the serpentinized layer results in a decoupling between the 
crustal and upper mantle tectonics. Accordingly, the serpentinization level 
should account for the absence or scarcity of seismicity above 15km. 

- High magnitude events will propagate from upper mantle into crustal levels 
across the serpentinized layer inducing superficial rupture. In contrast, present-
day micro-seismicity is mainly restricted to the upper mantle. 

- Slip of large magnitude events (M&gt;8) can propagate both up and downwards, 
i.e. into and across the serpentinized layer, as well as into and across brittle-
ductile boundary, disturbing the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (see Fig. 
IV.14). 

V.5.The plate boundary in the study area 

Although this study did not report the existence of a series of aligned linear 
seismicity cluster that could help defining a plate boundary we think it 
contributed to its understanding. 

Seismicity occurs in clusters at large faults intersections. All these clusters 
indicate the seismic activity of various fault sets, including the SWIM faults, 
probably the best candidates for accommodating the wrench displacement of 
Nubia with respect to SW Iberia.  



Strain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate 
boundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia 
 

254 
 

It also results from the present study that widespread serpentinization proposed 
by Sallarés et al. 2011 is probably a still active mechanism. The deformation of 
the NE-SW striking thrusts and large segments of the SWIM faults are locked or 
aseismic during the quiescence gap of large to mega earthquakes. Aseismic 
slip may be promoted by the serpentinization layer.  

The NEAREST network recorded some seismic activity below the Gulf of Cadiz 
accretionary wedge. Some focal mechanism solutions show reverse dip-slip 
solutions compatible with east-dipping subduction zone described in Gutscher 
et al. 2002 and Duarte et al., 2013. Note that these events are located outside 
the deployment area of the NEAREST network and are poorly constrained.   

The micro-seismicity distribution is also related to the inherited limits of Atlantic 
and Tethys basins. The São Vicente cluster may mark the limit between the 
Mesozoic North Atlantic and Western Tethys margins. The Central Atlantic and 
Tethys oceans paleo-plate boundary may be aligned with the Horseshoe 
abyssal plain cluster. 

V.6.Conclusion 

The main conclusions of this work are:  

? We identified three seismicity clusters located in the areas of the 
Gorringe Bank, São Vicente Canyon and along the Horseshoe Abyssal 
plain showing that seismicity is not uniformly distributed in the Gulf of 
Cadiz area also as suggested by NEAREST preliminary results (Geissler 
et al., 2010) and clustering analysis in Custódio et al, (2016); 

? The three seismicity clusters characterized in this work show that the 
present day micro-seismic activity is generated in the lithospheric mantle 
and concentrates at faults intersections mapped on the sea floor using 
swath bathymetry, suggesting that the crustal fabric may be replicated in 
the lithospheric mantle; these cluster also show that seismic strain 
concentrates on fault intersection loci; The inferred fault interference 
zones in the upper mantle are associated with boundaries of lithospheric 
domains localizing stress and seismic strain; 

? Active crustal faults with bathymetric expression, such as the Horseshoe 
and Marquês de Pombal faults are either locked or move through slow 
aseismic slip. Frictional slip may only result from high magnitude 
earthquakes;  

? Serpentinization controls seismicity distribution by inducing tectonic 
decoupling and inhibiting micro-seismicity to occur above the 
serpentinized layer. Only during high-magnitude events it is expected 
seismic rupture to propagate upwards across the serpentinized layer up 
to the surface.  



V. Discussion and conclusion 
 

255 
 

? Slip propagation from a non-serpentinized mantle into serpentinized 
mantle is a possible mechanism to produce larger slip areas, due to the 
release of pore fluid pressure accumulated during previous aseismic 
events. This mechanism can account for larger than expected slip for a 
high magnitude earthquake, like it is assumed for the 1755 event from 
numerical modelling of tsunami and inundation (Johnston, 1996, Gradin 
et al., 2007, Baptista et al.1998, 2009). 

V.7.Future work 

Seismological studies: 

? Re-locate the NEAREST dataset using the double difference method 
(HypoDD- Waldhouser and Ellsworth, 2000). We tested this method 
during our study but it needs to be improved. In seismicity distribution 
with associated clustering, this method may improve events locations. 

? Apply the stress tensor inversion to intermediate to high magnitude 
earthquakes reported in the Gulf of Cadiz by land permanent network 
and compare with NEAREST results. The idea is to explore if the stress 
tensors are similar for the different scales of magnitude. This may 
indicate if the mechanism associated with earthquakes generation is the 
same.  

? Explore in the NEAREST dataset the evidences of low frequency 
earthquakes that can be evidences for fluid fault interactions.  

? OBS networks deployments off-shore SW-W Iberian margins. Temporary 
deployment result in more accurate measurement of off-shore seismic 
activity.    

Numerical modelling: 

? Test 3D numerical models for the extrapolated mantle fault zones;  

? Create fault plane models incorporating patches of serpentinized mantle 
to explore the influence of this lithology on the slip propagation during 
high magnitude earthquakes. Also explore the control of low friction 
lithologies on slip during the seismic cycle (interseismic, coseimic and 
postseismic periods). 

Geological/geophysical studies: 

? Depth migration of key MCS reflection profiles to study depth extends of 
the active faults in the study area. In the last decades, as part of different 
European projects (see chapter II), several MCS reflection profiles were 
acquired in Gulf of Cadiz area. Some of these profiles have deep 
penetration, with seismic signal extending down 14s (TWT, e.g IAM MCS 
profiles). 



Strain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate 
boundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia 
 

256 
 

? Acquire wide-angle seismic reflection and refraction profiles NE-SW 
across the Gorringe Bank and the HAP. These profiles would contribute 
to define the lithospheric limits in the study area.

Appendix V – IAM-GB1 acquiring parameters and processing sequence 

Acquisition parameters 

The IAM-GB1 multichannel reflection seismic profile was acquired using a 
SWAG air-gun array with a total energy volume of 7524 cu. in. The source 
depth was of 10m and the shot interval of 75m. The receivers were distributed 
on a streamer with 192 groups with an interval of 25m, with five auxiliary 
channels. The cable was at a depth of 18m. The in line the near offset was 
254m (Figure A. 1). The streamer length, between the centres of the first and 
last receivers groups, was 4775m. The sample rate was 4ms and the record 
length 25s. No low-cut filter was applied in the acquisition system only a high-
cut filter at 92Hz with a slope of 72dB/oct and a gain constant of 24dB. The 
primary navigation system was DGPS.  

 
Figure A. 1-.Shooting configuration (adapted to IAM-GB1 configuration from IAM final 
scientific report): sample rate-4ms; record Length:25s; Shot-point interval 75m; number 
of channels 192; group interval 25m; cable depth 18m; near in-line offset:254m 

Processing sequence 

The IAM-GB1 re-processing work was performed using Globe Claritas from 
GNS Science a software package for 2D and 3D land and marine seismic data 
at Barcelona Centre for Subsurface imaging under supervision of the Research 
Professor César Ranero. The processing sequence was trace mute; defining in-
line geometry; trace editing; velocity analysis; de-convolution; stacking; time 
migration and depth conversion. We used NEAREST P1 refraction velocities to 
convert time migrated profile in depth.  

Defining in–line geometry 

Since no navigation files were available, the geometry was established using 
acquisition parameters, assuming a regular geometry. On most 2D marine 
surveys it is considered that the cable followed directly behind the boat in a 
straight line (Figure A. 1). This assumption allows us to have a simple linkage 



Strain partitioning and seismicity distribution in the transpressive plate 
boundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia 
 

298 
 

between the shot point number, the channel number, the offset and the CMP 
(common midpoint) number. The processing sequence is shown in Figure A. 2.  

 

 

Figure A. 2-Processing flow to establish in-line geometry 

In the Claritas’ software, the processing steps are defined using work-flows 
(jobs), which include the user defined operations (modules). The first module of 
any job is SEISJOB where is included information on the processing line (e.g 
the line number).  

The READSEGY is the module process to import SEGY data into Claritas 
environment. The TREMOVE module was used to remove dummy and auxiliary 
traces. In the current example it was used to exclude auxiliary traces in the 
beginning of the profile. The selected trace kind was Nonlive, removing all 
traces with TRTYPE not set to 1 (live seismic data). 

The MGEOM process module of Claritas is designed to set a regular 2D marine 
geometry (Figure A. 3). It is appropriate to those cases when navigation is not 
available. The MGEOM reads the information in a geometry file (Figure A. 3) or 
directly from more advanced parameters items and defines a linear shot-CMP 
(common midpoint) relationship. We applied the MODE = "CDP (common depth 
point) &amp;amp; OFFSET", i.e. the existing shot-point and channel trace headers were 
used to calculate CDP &amp;amp; OFFSET. Note that although this parameter refers to 
CDP that is only correct if the reflectors are sub-horizontal.   

We show the different parameters defining the geometry in Figure A. 4, note 
that the first shot point and CMP were set to 101 and 100, respectively. Finally 
we used the QSORT module to define marine CMP sort outputs (Figure A. 5). 
Shots were the input data and CMPs are output. The geometry for the line was

defined using the same geometry file in MGEOM. The output from QSORT is 
ordered within CMPs in increasing offset order (Figure A. 6).

Increasing the signal to noise ratio is a central step in the processing flow. In the 
beginning of the profile it was identified random noise derived from swell and

cable noise. In this context, different processing modules were tested to 
attenuate this noise. Finally, we selected FXDECONV module (Figure A. 7). 
This module transforms each trace into frequency domain, than a complex 
Wiener deconvolution is applied for each frequency in X direction and finally the 
traces are transformed back into the time domain.

Velocity analysis  

The velocity analysis was performed in different steps and consumed most of 
the processing time. We started by creating an initial stack (including only 
CDPTRACES 1-10) using a normal move out correction based in a constant 
velocity of 1500 km/s and amplitude scaling. In the next step we identified and 
picked the main horizons in the IAM-GB1 line (Figure A. 8). Following we 
generated an interval velocity file based on the horizons picking and predefined 
velocity model based on the previous information on velocities for the area. This 
file was converted to root mean square (rms) velocities and a new stacking file 
was generated including all CDPTRACES.

boundary: SW Iberia-NW Nubia

Figure A. 8- First stacking with horizons picking 

In the final step we used constant velocity analysis tool in Claritas’ software to 
improve velocity model using semblance analysis. With this tool we could 
observe simultaneously in different windows the stacking image, the CMP 
gather and the semblance analysis. In this way we could observe the 
improvements in normal move out corrections and the effects on stacking 
display. The final velocity model is presented in Figure A. 9. 

 
Figure A. 9-Final rms velocity model 

Final stacking: 

Before the final stack we applied to the CMP gather a time-varying and 
spatially-varying predictive deconvolution using DECONW module. The 
deconvolution is applied to the seismic trace over a set of time gates. The filters 
(one for each time gate) are designed within the design time gates, and are 
applied over the application time gates. These design windows were picked in 
CMP gathers with intervals of 400 CMPs. We tested a different set of filters 
(workflow in Figure A. 10). In Figure A. 11, we compare a fraction of the 
stacking line with and without deconvolution. 

Before the final stack, we applied the NMO correction using the final rms 
velocity model and a space variant inner trace mute. The final stack is 
presented in Figure A. 12.

Time Migration  

To apply the pos-stack time migration, we converted stacking velocities to 
interval velocities. We started by re-picking seismic horizons in the final stack 
(Figure A. 13). In the next step, we introduced the horizons and the stacking 
velocity model in Claritas’ isovels application to create an interval velocity model 
and then we smooth this model.  

We used the FDMIG module to apply a finite difference time migration with the 
above interval velocity model. The results are presented in Figure A. 14.

 Depth conversion: 

The TDCONV1 module performs a depth conversion on stacked data using 
previously defined interval velocities. The velocities were extracted from 
NEAREST refraction profile P1 in the interval of intersection of this profile with 
the IAM-GB1 line (see Figure A. 15). We converted these data to interval 
velocities (based on the picked seismic horizons). The velocity model is 
presented in Figure A. 15 and we compare it with previous data extracted from 
a parallel refraction profile B-BR in Purdy et al. (1975). In detail, we observe that 
particularly for intermediate layers and in the IAM-GB1 SW or NE limits, the 
velocities used are higher. In the central part of the profile, between CMPs 500 
and 8500, the velocities are more consistent with the work Purdy et al. (1975). 
The velocity model is also in conformity with the pre-stack velocities in 
intersection area of AR-01 with IAM-GB1 (fig.6 in Rovere et al., 2004 for details 
on the velocity model). The final depth converted IAM-GB1 profile is in Figure A. 
16.

The Gulf  of  Cadiz  and  the passive  continental  margin of southern Iberia  to  the  west  of the  Strait of Gibral-

tar locally  accommodate  the  presently  ongoing  convergence  between Africa  and  Eurasia  by  widespread,

rather  diffusive,  seismic  activity.  Seismicity  of the  northern  Gulf  of Cadiz  was derived  from  an  amphibi-

ous  seismological network, including  24  temporary  marine  offshore stations, besides the permanent

networks  in Portugal,  Spain,  and  Morocco.  During  the  6 month of the  offshore  network  operation,  in

total  86 local  earthquakes  were  located  at six or  more  offshore  stations with  the  majority  of earthquakes

occurring  to the  southwest  of Iberia  and along  the  Algarve  continental  margin off  southern  Iberia. The

distribution of events  along  the  Algarve  margin mimics features reported  for  the  Atlantic  passive  conti-

nental margins  of  both  South  and  North  America.  Focal  mechanisms  at the  Portimão  Bank support  that

seismically active areas  are  associated  with  compression.  Similar stress patterns  are  reported  for  the east

coast of South and  North  America.  However,  while  earthquakes  along  the  American  east coast occur  at

crustal  levels, earthquakes  in the  northern  Gulf  of Cadiz  occur  both  in the  lower crust  and  upper mantle,

with  the  majority  of events rupturing  within  the mantle, including  a  number  of well-located earthquakes

beneath crust  forming  the  continent-ocean  transition  zone.  The large  number  of earthquakes in the  man-

tle  might  be  caused by  the  unique geological  setting,  where  deformation occurs  in cool lithosphere  of

Mesozoic age.  We suggest  that  seismicity along  the  Algarve  margin  is  caused  by  re-activation of pre-

existing  margin-parallel  faults  rather  than corresponding  to newly  formed  structures  related  to  a new

developing  plate  boundary.

1. Introduction

The ocean-continent boundary of southern Iberia to the west

of the Strait of Gibraltar is  defined as a  passive continental mar-

gin, along which the continent and seafloor are  part of the same

plate (Fig. 1). In the framework of plate tectonics (e.g., McKenzie

and Parker, 1967; Morgan, 1968) the interior of plates is defined

as being seismically inactive. However, even stable continental

regions (SCR), including passive continental margins, show occa-

sionally seismic activity. World-wide, Schulte and Mooney (2005)

reported 1371 crustal earthquakes with magnitude larger than

4.5 hitting stable continental lithosphere, with roughly 50% of the

seismicity occurring at Mesozoic passive margins. Earthquakes rup-

turing along passive margins occur both onshore and offshore and

may  reach magnitude 7 (Wolin et al., 2012). It  is  generally believed

that these events are related to the reactivation of favourably ori-

ented pre-existing fault planes in  response to  broad-scale uniform

regional stress fields (Zoback, 1992; Wolin et al., 2012). This idea

is supported by observation that  passive margins are  often reacti-

vated in compression (Cloetingh et al., 2008).

Wolin et al. (2012) called the Eastern US passive continental

margin off  Virginia “a passive-aggressive” margin after on 23rd

of August 2011 a magnitude M =  5.8 hit the town of  Mineral. The

entire eastern coast of North American has a  long record of sev-

eral magnitude 6–7 earthquakes, including the M =  7.2 1929 Grand

Banks earthquake, causing a  landslide and tsunami (Bent, 1995).

In addition to far-field stresses, glacial isostatic rebound has been

suggested to control earthquakes at passive margins. However, far-

ther south along the margin of eastern Brazil earthquakes with

magnitudes of larger than 5 occur every 20–25 years (Assumpcao

et al., 2011), indicating that forces other than isostatic adjustments

contribute to control seismicity along passive margins.

Passive continental margins occur generally several thousands

of kilometres away from major plate boundary faults. The southern

passive margin of Iberia, including the Algarve margin, however, is

located near or at the Azores-Gibraltar seismic zone, marking the

plate boundary between Eurasia/Iberia and Africa. To the east of

14?W the plate boundary is not  well defined and seismicity is  rather

diffuse (Sartori et al., 1994; Buforn et al., 2004)  and the WNW-ESE

plate convergence of ?4 mm/yr (DeMets et al., 2010)  is accommo-

dated through widespread tectonically active deformation (Sartori

et al., 1994; Hayward et al., 1999). Consequently, convergence may

have caused Neogene to Quaternary reactivation of Mesozoic rifting

structures (Zitellini et al., 2004), which in turn may  control tectonic

and seismic activity along the passive margin of southern Iberia and

in the Gulf of Cadiz (e.g., Borges et al., 2001; Buforn et al., 2004; Stich

et al., 2005).

Bathymetric and multi-channel seismic (MCS) data suggest that

today’s plate boundary might be defined by  a  set of WNW-ESE

trending faults (called the South-West Iberia Margin or SWIM

faults; Zitellini et al., 2009; Bartolome et al., 2012), running to

the south of ?36?N. In this scenario the seismicity paralleling

the Algarve margin might not be related to a  newly develop-

ing plate boundary, but still might be associated with far-field

stresses caused by  convergence. In a  scenario of active westward

retreat of a narrow slab (e.g., Gutscher, 2004; Gutscher et al., 2012)

hanging under the western Alboran Sea and the southern Betics

(Gutscher et al., 2002; Garcia-Castellanos and Villasen?or, 2011)

seismicity along the Algarve margin might be caused by a  so called

Subduction-Transform Edge Propagator, or STEP fault (Govers and

Wortel, 2005).

Here, we  report results from a  large amphibious seismic net-

work, including 24 offshore ocean-bottom-seismometers (OBS)

installed in the Gulf of Cadiz to the north of 35?25?N and east of

9?30?W (Figs. 1 and 2). The network allows robust source estimates

of offshore seismicity and hence may  yield constraints on the active

deformation of crust und upper mantle of the reactivated Mesozoic

passive margin and seismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz. Our interpre-

tations are  nurtured by a  new seismic refraction and wide-angle

profile shot in  the area (Sallares et al., 2011) that provides robust

estimates on the nature of crust underlying the Gulf of Cadiz sed-

imentary prism and the southern Iberian continental margin. We

will discuss micro-earthquake activity in  the Gulf of Cadiz with

respect to different tectonic settings, including other passive conti-

nental margins like  the east coast of both North and South America.

However, seismicity might be controlled by a  newly developing

plate boundary and we will hence discuss features with respect to

a  reorientation of the Eurasian-African plate boundary. Further, the

seismicity pattern derived from the deployment will be discussed

with respect to scenarios envisioning either active eastward dip-

ping subduction (Gutscher et al., 2002) or active strike-slip faulting

along the SWIM faults (e.g, Zitellini et al., 2009; Bartolome et al.,

2012; Duarte et al., 2011).

2. Tectonic setting

In  the Gulf  of Cadiz to  the west of the Gibraltar Arc, the plate

boundary between Eurasia and Africa is rather poorly defined.

Instead, WNW-ESE plate convergence of 4 mm/yr (DeMets et al.,

2010)  is accommodated over a wide and diffuse deformation zone

(Sartori et al., 1994; Hayward et al., 1999),  following a  large scale

strain partitioning scenario (Terrinha et al., 2009) and showing sig-

nificant and widespread seismic activity (e.g., Stich et al., 2005;

Buforn et al., 2004; Geissler et al., 2010). The region is  also char-

acterized by large earthquakes and tsunamis, such as the Great

Lisbon earthquake of 1st of November 1755 with an estimated mag-

nitude of Mw ? 8.5–8.8 (Martinez-Solares et al., 1979; Johnston,

1996) and the 1969 Mw  =  7.9 Horseshoe Abyssal Plain earthquake

(Fukao, 1973).

Crustal domains in  the central Gulf of Cadiz and at the Mesozoic

continental margin of the Algarve, Southern Portugal/Iberia, can be

defined by seismic refraction and wide-angle data (Sallares et al.,

2011; Martinez-Loriente et al., 2014; Fig. 1), indicating 28–30 km

thick continental crust near the coast line, a  60 km wide transition

zone, where the crust thins to ?20 km, and a 7 km thick oceanic

crust roughly 100–120 km  off the coast (Fig. 1). The passive mar-

gin of southern Iberia and the Algarve formed during the Triassic

breakup of Pangea (Heymann, 1989). However, oceanic crust floor-

ing the Gulf of Cadiz postdates margin formation. Plate tectonic

models (e.g., Schettino and Turco, 2011) suggests that between

185 Ma and ?145 Ma rifting between Africa and North America

opened the Atlantic while farther east the Tethys ocean formed.

Plate motion caused by  the opening of the Atlantic was transferred

to the Tethyan realm through a  system of transform faults between

Iberia and Morocco. Sallares et al. (2011) suggested that oceanic

crustal formation occurred at the end of the opening of the Tethys

at ?145 Ma,  probably by oblique sinistral seafloor spreading which

ceased when Newfoundland broke apart from Western Iberia at

?130 Ma.

Plate reconstructions suggest that convergence between Africa

and Eurasia started between 120 to 83 Ma.  From the Paleocene to

Eocene, African and Eurasian convergence was mostly accommo-

dated in the Alpine collision zone. Since about 35 Ma the western

Mediterranean and the Gibraltar arc were affected by slab roll-

back (Royden, 1993; Faccenna et al., 2001; Spakman and Wortel,

2004). Geodynamic modelling suggests that northward subduction

occurred initially at the Balearic margin. At about 30 Ma, the trench

and subduction rotated and westward slab roll-back occurred until

Tortonian, suggesting that both subduction and slab roll back is

stalled since 8 Ma (Chertova et al., 2014).

Today, the main morphotectonic feature of the Gulf of  Cadiz

is the up to 10 km  thick sedimentary wedge (e.g., Thiebot and

Gutscher, 2006). Its formation is  still controversially discussed. The

wedge itself is  formed by large allochthonous masses with seismi-

cally chaotic reflections at the forefront of the Gibraltar Arc (e.g.,

Torelli et al., 1997; Maldonado et al., 1999; Gràcia et al., 2003;

Rovere et al., 2004). The chaotic sedimentary melange shows signs

of intense deformation and westward transport, attributed primar-

ily to wrench faulting between Africa and Eurasia as well as gravity

sliding (Torelli et al., 1997; Maldonado et al., 1999). However, the

observed features can also be interpreted as accretionary complex

of an eastward dipping subduction zone (e.g., Gutscher et al., 2002),

supporting the tectonic framework introduced above. Miocene

eastward subduction is  supported by ample evidence, including

arc-formation in  the Alboran Sea (Duggen et al., 2003, 2004; Booth-

Rea et al., 2007) and seismological imaging of a subducted slab

and intermediate seismicity under the West Alboran Sea (Gutscher

et al., 2002; Garcia-Castellanos and Villasen?or, 2011; Grevemeyer

et al., 2015) and mantle flow (Díaz and Gallart, 2014). Gutscher et al.

(2006) suggested that still active subduction may  have caused the

Great Lisbon earthquake of 1755. However, deformation pattern

and geodynamic modelling may  suggest that subduction is stalled

since Tortonian (e.g., Iribarren et al., 2007; Chertova et al., 2014).

Simulations of seismic ground motions of the Great Lisbon

earthquake favour a source to the west of Cape Sao Vicente (Grandin

et al., 2007) in the Horseshoe abyssal plain or at the Gorringe Bank

(Johnston, 1996). Baptista et al. (1998, 2011) analyzed all evidences

on the 1755 tsunami and concluded that  wave amplitudes and

tsunami travel times estimated from historical records are best

explained by a tectonic source in the SW of Iberia closer to  the

coast, excluding the Gorringe Bank and Gulf of Cadiz accretionary

wedge as possible sources.

High-resolution bathymetric mapping of the Gulf of  Cadiz and

the adjacent Horseshoe abyssal plain indicated a  set of almost linear

and sub parallel dextral strike–slip faults, the South-West-Iberia-

Margin or SWIM faults (Zitellini et al., 2009). The features form a

narrow band of deformation over a  length of 600 km and roughly

coincide with a  small circle centred on the pole of rotation of Africa

with respect to Eurasia. Zitellini et al. (2009) suggested that  the

SWIM faults may  connect to the Eurasian-African plate boundary

farther west and east and hence may  indicate a newly developing

segment of the plate boundary between Africa and Eurasia. Seismic

reflection imaging revealed that the SWIM lineaments cut  down to

at least 10 km (Bartolome et al., 2012). Terrinha et al. (2009) and

Duarte et al. (2011) suggest that the lineaments represent the reac-

tivation of Mesocoic faults that root in the underlying basement.

Seismically neither the SWIM lineaments nor the proposed Gulf

of Cadiz subduction thrust showed any prominent seismic activity

detectable utilizing onshore seismic monitoring (e.g., Buforn et al.,

2004; Stich et al., 2005).

3. Seismological data and methodology

3.1. Data

In the Gulf of  Cadiz 24 ocean-bottom-seismometers (OBS) were

deployed along the southern Iberian continental margin and on the

Gulf of Cadiz accretionary wedge (Figs. 1 and 2). The deployment

was part of the European Science Foundation (ESF) coordinated

programme TOPO-Europe. Marine deployments of our  exercise,

called TOPO-MED, were supplemented by  the permanent seismic

networks operated in Portugal, Spain, and Morocco (Fig. 2).

The offshore network was operated between 20th of January

2010 and 21st of July 2010. The network consisted of 24

OBS, including 5 wide-band OBS operating a three-component

Guralp CMG-40T (60 s) seismometer and a HighTech HTI-04-

PCA/ULF hydrophone from the German DEPAS pool. In addition,

19 GEOMAR-OBS, equipped with a  hydrophone and 3-compenent

short-period seismometers with a  natural frequency of 4.5 Hz,

were operated. Seismic events were detected automatically in

the continuous OBS record using a short-term-average versus a

long-term-average (STA/LTA) triggering approach. We  used a STA

window of 0.5 s and a  LTA window of 60 s. The trigger ratio was

4.0 and the de-trigger ratio was 2.5. The trigger parameters were

applied to unfiltered vertical component data. We consider a  trig-

ger to be an earthquake when it was detected on six  or  more OBS

stations. Visual inspection of the data suggested that we obtained

generally less than ?5% false triggers and lose only those events that

were recorded on a  few stations and characterized by a  poor signal

noise ratio, while all major events were included. Surprisingly, only

a reasonable small number of&amp;lt;100 events was detected and the

detected events generally coincide with earthquakes reported in

the national catalogue of Portugal. We believe that the up to 12 km

thick sedimentary prism (Thiebot and Gutscher, 2006)  caused a

very high attenuation. Further, the area is  inherently affected by

strong noise caused by ship’s traffic through the Strait of Gibral-

tar (Fig. 3), requiring earthquakes with magnitudes of larger ?2

to be detected within the offshore network. This interpretation is

supported by the fact that the smallest magnitude of local earth-

quakes was roughly one order of magnitude larger than for an

OBS network operated in the Alboran Sea to  the east of Gibral-

tar (Grevemeyer et al., 2015). The OBS farthest to the east, sitting

on the thickest portion of the prism, provided the smallest num-

ber of readings of local earthquakes, supporting the interpretation

that thicker sediments provide higher attenuation. However, the

OBS network detected all offshore events occurring within the net-

work that were reported in  either the catalogue of the Instituto

Português do Mar  e da Atmosfera (IPMA, Portugal) or the Spanish

Instituto Geografico Nacional (IGN, Spain). In addition, four and six

additional events were detected with respect to  the IPMA and IGN

catalogue, respectively.

All events were registered into a SEISAN database (Havskov

and Ottemöller, 2000),  using a  3 min  long time window from

the continuous OBS records and data from the Portuguese net-

Fig. 3. Power Spectral Density (PSD) of OBS36 (red line) in the Gulf of Cadiz and an

OBS deployed at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) near 15? N (black line). Note the much

higher noise level observed in the Gulf of Cadiz. It might be reasonable to  suggest

that strong noise from ship’s traffic affected seismic recordings, resulting in a  much

lower detection of small earthquakes with respect to  quieter settings. OBS from  the

work, starting 20 s prior to trigger time. P-wave and S-wave

arrival times were hand-picked. In total, we obtained 86  local

earthquakes from the Gulf of Cadiz and adjacent domains. The

reading weighting scheme ranges from factor 0,  corresponding to

the lowest uncertainty (±0.05 s), to factor 4 (&gt;0.3 s) for doubtful

readings that were not used. The total average P wave reading

error is estimated at ±0.12 s. Latter, additional onset times from

land stations in  Spain and Morocco were added to  the database

(http://www.isc.ac.uk/iscbulletin/search/bulletin).

3.2. Location procedure and velocity models

To constrain epicentres and focal depth we surveyed four dif-

ferent 1D velocity models and used two different algorithms.

Earthquakes were located (1) with the program HYPOCENTER,

which employs an iterative solution to the nonlinear localization

problem (Lienert et al., 1986; Lienert and Havskov, 1995) and (2)

using the non-linear probabilistic location procedure NonLinLoc of

Lomax et al. (2000). Unfortunately, the number of events within the

network was too small to  derived robust station corrections. We

therefore used for both location procedures station elevations to

constrain differences in topography between onshore and offshore

domains.

Locating earthquakes in  the Gulf of Cadiz using a  1-D reference

model is a  difficult task since crustal thickness for onshore stations

will be in the order of 30 km while OBS on the prism will sit on thin

oceanic crust covered by 3–8 km of sediments. We  therefore uti-

lized different velocity models and location algorithms to provide

an effective way to explore the uncertainties associated with each

earthquake and the bias caused by different velocity models. For

event location we used (i) the global AK135 model (Kennett et al.,

1995), (ii) the model that Geissler et al. (2010) used to  locate local

earthquakes to the SW of Portugal (Fig. 4a, red line; called G-16);

(iii) the velocity structure to the north of the Portimão Bank (Fig. 4a,

blue line; called OBS-Portimão) derived from 2-D seismic refrac-

tion data (Sallares et al., 2011), representing extended continental

crust, and (iv) the velocity structure of the distal imbricated wedge

derived from 2-D  seismic refraction data (Sallares et al., 2011),

representing Jurassic oceanic crust covered by 5 km of sediment

(Fig. 4a, green line; called OBS-prism).

In  the individual location procedures, most earthquakes pro-

duced formal errors of ±0.5–2 km for the epicentre and ±2–5 km

in focal depth. However, deeper earthquakes (&gt;30 km)  may  have

larger epicentral errors of ±2–4 km  and ±3–8 km in focal depth

(Fig. 4). Overall, seismic events with good azimuthal coverage pro-

vided very similar depth estimates, like two very well located thrust

events at the Portimão Bank. The events occurred clearly within the

upper mantle at 30–45 km  (Figs. 4 and 5). Depending on the velocity

structure used for event location, event depth may  vary by ?10 km

and epicentral locations may  vary in the order of 2–20 km. How-

ever, in a map  view, changes of epicentres were generally minor.

With respect to depth, changes are much more significant. The

AK135 model provided the most compact depth distribution of all

velocity models (Fig. 6a) with basically all earthquakes occurring

in the upper mantle. However, both crustal thickness and mantle

velocity poorly match constraints from seismic data in the area. In

fact AK135 includes a  much thicker crust and faster mantle velocity

than observed off SW Iberia (e.g., Sallares et al., 2011). The model G-

16 of Geissler et al. (2010) approximates the onshore and offshore

domains by using a  crustal thickness of 16 km,  which is  thinner than

the crust of Iberia but thicker than the Jurassic oceanic crust sam-

pled offshore (Sallares et al., 2011). In general, depth distribution

of earthquakes is rather compact, ranging from ?5 km to  ?45 km

(Fig. 6b). Thus, earthquakes occur both in the crust and upper man-

tle. The model OBS-Portimão has a  crustal thickness of 28 km and

a continental crust-type velocity structure. Depth distribution of

earthquakes is similar to the model G-16, but showed a  wider range

in depth (Fig. 6c).  The model OBS-prism has approximately 5 km

of sediments covering 7 km of oceanic crust. The depth distribu-

tion is scattered over a  much larger depth range (Fig. 6d). With

respect to the average rms  fit all four models provided in the Non-

LinLoc location procedure rather similar fits. Due to its compactness

of  depth distribution, we  prefer the model G-16. The fact that all

models provide evidence for earthquakes rupturing at 30–50 km

depth clearly supports the fact that a  large number of earthquakes

occurred within the mantle of the continental domain as defined

by Martinez-Loriente et al. (2014, Fig. 1).

The seismic velocity models constrained only the P-wave veloc-

ity structure. To constrain Vp/Vs ratios, we used Wadati diagrams

(S-P time versus P  time) and calculated an average Vp/Vs ratio

(Havskov and Ottemöller, 2000). To constrain the Vp/Vs ratio we

used 81 earthquakes with at least eight P-wave and S-wave pairs,

a  rms  event location misfit of 0.3 or better, and a  correlation coeffi-

cient of the fit of S-P time versus P time of &gt;0.9. The resulting Vp/Vs

ratio was 1.68.

To explore the benefit of having an amphibious network, we

removed the OBS arrival times from the catalogue and re-located

the events. For most offshore events the uncertainty increased and

errors are  doubled or  even tripled. As an example Fig. 5 shows

the two thrust events of 5 and 18 of May of 2010. Removing the

offshore stations, epicentres are  shifted 5–10 km  to the southwest

and the probability-density-function (PDF) is smeared in SW-NE

direction, indicating uncertainties of ±5–8 km.  In depth, the PDF

for the first event is not well defined (non Gaussian distribution)

and uncertainties are in  the order of ±10–15 km.  For  the second

event, the preferred depth estimate would be at 20 km rather

than at 38 km.  Like for the previous event, uncertainties are in

the order ±10–15 km.  Thus, offshore seismometers clearly improve

the quality of event locations. Therefore, constraints from onshore

networks alone might be  profoundly biased. Supplementary Fig.

S1 shows the mis-location between regional catalogues and our

estimates as a  function of offset from the margin.

and Havskov (2003).  The two largest earthquakes recorded within

the offshore network were a Mw = 3.6 thrust faulting earthquake in

the vicinity of the Portimão Bank near OBS45 and a  Mw =  3.6 strike

slip earthquake to the northwest of the Portimão Bank just west

of OBS53. The largest earthquake that occurred during the deploy-

ment was a magnitude 4.3 event near  the Moroccan coast about

180 km west of the city of Fez (?30 km to  the south west of seis-

mic  stations TSY), hitting on 22 April 2010. Most events, however,

had magnitudes of Mw = 2.2 to 2.9. The smallest earthquakes had

magnitudes of ?1.8.

3.4. Focal mechanisms

In  local marine earthquake studies, double-couple focal mecha-

nisms are generally derived from first motion. Unfortunately, all

recorded events were too small to  allow regional moment ten-

sor inversion using permanent networks. Thus, we derived fault

plane solutions using HASH and FOCMEC algorithms (Hardebeck

where both approaches provided similar solutions (Table 1).

4. Results

4.1. Distribution of seismicity

Seismicity in the Gulf of Cadiz and to the southwest of Portugal

is not evenly distributed in space but highly clustered. During the

deployment about half of the observed seismicity occurred to  the

west of the network, including areas of major activity at the Gor-

ringe Bank, at the Sao  Vicente Canyon to the south of the Cape Sao

Vicente, and across the Horseshoe fault.

The area of largest activity well covered by the network occurred

along the continental margin of southern Iberia to the north of 36?N,

including a number of Mw &gt; 3 earthquakes at or in  the vicinity of the

Portimão Bank offshore the Algarve (Fig. 2). With a  depth range of

15 to ?40 km,  the majority of hypocentres occurred both within

the lower crust and upper mantle. The two strongest and best

located events occurred at &gt;30 km depth (independent of veloc-

ity model) and hence within the uppermost mantle (Figs. 4 and 5).

Fig. 7 shows earthquakes to the east of 9?30?W (located with model

G-16) projected on to the seismic refraction and wide-angle pro-

file of Sallares et al. (2011). Interestingly, all earthquakes occurred

below the 5-km/s-contour line, suggesting that earthquakes occur

within the basement and preferentially in the lower continental

crust and uppermost mantle. Due to structural heterogeneities in

the area and the fact that a  1-D  reference model was used to locate

the events, we carried out the same exercise using the other velocity

models (Supplementary Fig. 3). Overall, the features are very sim-

ilar, supporting that the majority of earthquakes ruptured either

in the lower crust or upper mantle. However, as indicated by the

histograms in Fig. 6, the portion of earthquakes at mantle depth

increases using either a  thicker crust or global model.

On 22 of April 2010 the largest recorded event occurred roughly

100 km to the east of the marine network at the Moroccan coast

line near the seismic station TSY. The earthquake with a  magni-

tude of mb = 4.5 was recorded on nearly all stations of the network.

The large spacing of seismic stations near the epicentre resulted

in large uncertainties of focal depth. However, like  the Interna-

tional Seismological Centre (ISC) (http://www.isc.ac.uk/iscbulletin/

search/bulletin) we  located the event within the mantle at &gt;40 km.

An interesting feature is  the almost lack of seismicity to  the

south of 36?N where sediment is  thickest and the eastward dipping

subduction thrust has been imaged (Gutscher et al., 2002). Thus,

basically all earthquakes occurred to the north of the 5–12 km thick

accretionary prism (Fig.  8a). Furthermore, in the same area major

strike slip faults (Zitellini et al., 2009; Bartolome et al., 2012)  have

been deduced from bathymetric and seismic data (labelled SWIM1

and SWIM2  in Figs. 1 and 2). However, over the six month of net-

work operation little evidence for seismogenic slip along the faults

was observed. Just to the west of OBS39 and OBS41, some seismic-

ity might be associated with the SWIM1  fault. Trade-offs between

epicentral location and focal depth cause too large uncertainties to

draw any robust conclusions regarding these particular events.

Most earthquakes along the margin might be related to  the

structure of the margin. Gràcia et al. (2003) highlighted a promi-

nent SW-NE striking gravity anomaly – the Guadalquivir-Portimao

lineament – terminating at the Portimão Bank. Most earthquakes

at the margin seem to occur in  the vicinity of this anomaly (Fig. 8b),

suggesting that the structure of the margin controls the distribu-

tion of seismicity. Plotting data obtained from regional catalogues,

like the IPMA or IGN seismic bulletins, provide basically the same

pattern (Fig. 8c and d).

4.2. Stress pattern

Focal mechanisms were derived for six earthquakes. In the vicin-

ity of the Portimão Bank thrusting dominates (Fig. 2).  However, the

same stress pattern may  be compatible with two  sets of conjugate

faults, both accommodating general N-S trending shortening. To

the northwest of the Portimão Bank two strike-slip events were

deduced (Fig. 2). Overall, focal mechanisms and hence stress pat-

tern mimic features observed in  previous studies (e.g., Borges et al.,

2001; Stich et al., 2005).

5. Discussion

5.1. Seismicity to the southwest of Portugal

The seismicity reported routinely by the Portuguese IPMA or

the Spanish IGN shows clustered seismicity at Gorringe Bank and

at the Sao Vicente Canyon, indicating different active fault systems

(e.g., Geissler et al., 2010). All  areas showed seismic activity during

the 6 month of network operation. Unfortunately, events recorded

at both the Gorringe Bank and at the Horseshoe Fault where well

outside of the network and hence hypocentral parameters have

too large uncertainties. Trade-offs between focal depth and epi-

central distance prevent robust estimates of either focal depth or

stress pattern. However, due to its proximity to  seismic stations

in  Portugal and the marine network, seismicity at the Sao Vicente

Canyon can be studied in  much more detail. Over the deployment

period we recorded more than 20 earthquakes that clustered near

the southwestern terminus of the canyon, making it one of the seis-

mically most active sites. Focal depth of 20–40 km indicates that

seismicity is generally located within the mantle. Geissler et al.

(2010) located earthquakes in the vicinity of the Sao Vicente fault

at a  greater depth of 40–55 km.  Focal mechanism and stress ten-

sor inversion of Geissler et al. (2010) yielded an obliquely oriented

compressive regime. The single focal mechanisms obtained during

our deployment supports the stress pattern observed previously.

5.2. Seismicity of the southern Iberia continental margin

The northern Gulf of Cadiz has been divided into an inner part

(off the city of Cadiz), a middle part with the Guadalquivir Bank, and

an outer part with the Portimão Bank (Gràcia et al., 2003). The outer

part is characterized by a  rough topography and is  dominated by

large submarine canyons that are  deeply incised in platformal areas.

To the south, both the Portimão Bank and Guadalquivir Bank show

thrust faults (Gràcia et al., 2003). During the marine deployment,

the middle and outer part of the Gulf of Cadiz were seismically

very active. Three thrust faulting events occurred at the Portimão

Bank and focal depth of the thrust events clearly support that they

rupture within the mantle (Figs. 4, 5 and 7). Based on bathymetric

and seismic data, it has been suggested that the Bank is  bounded

at both flanks by thrust faults (Gràcia et al., 2003; Terrinha et al.,

2009). Sallares et al. (2011) found southward dipping seismic veloc-

ity anomalies that were interpreted as crustal scale normal faults

formed during the formation of the passive margin in  the Meso-

zoic. It  might be  reasonable to  suggest that these faults cut into the

mantle and are reactivated in  response to the convergence between

Africa and Eurasia as thrusts.

For the US east coast stress pattern indicated roughly margin

parallel compression (Zoback, 1992), which is similar to stresses

caused by modelled intraplate stresses due to  plate-wide forces.

Earthquakes along the eastern continental margin of the US are

generally believed to reflect reactivation of ancient faults (Wolin

et al., 2012). Along the Iberian margin, Zitellini et al. (2004) sug-

gested that seismic activity occurs along reactivated Mesozoic rift

structures. Thus, earthquakes along the south Iberian continental

margin mimic  stresses and features envisioned for the US east coast.

The increased seismicity rate for the Iberian margin, however, may

reflect its proximity to the African/Eurasian plate boundary.

The main difference, however, is the much larger focal depth

of most earthquakes reported in  our study. Typical earthquakes

along passive continental margins, like the 23rd August 2011 Min-

eral, Virginia event (Wolin et al., 2012) or the 23rd April 2008 Sao

Vicente, Brazil event (Assumpcao et al., 2011), occurred within the

crust. In contrast, earthquakes along the southern Iberia margin

occurred predominately within the mantle. We hypothesize that

this feature is caused by the proximity to the plate boundary and

by an elastic rheology of the continent-ocean transition zone (see

discussion below).

Overall, our new depth estimates support previous results

obtained from global catalogues and regional waveform modelling

(Stich et al., 2005), showing seismicity both in  the crust and upper

mantle. However, events as deep as 60 km, that were previously

reported (Stich et al., 2005), have not  been observed during our

deployment. The stress pattern derived from the amphibious net-

work support features obtained previously (e.g., Borges et al., 2001;

Stich et al., 2005), suggesting that the Southern Iberian margin

is under horizontal compression. However, there is not a domi-

nant faulting regime, hence reverse, strike-slip, and normal faulting

mechanisms coexist in the Gulf of Cadiz and SW Iberia (e.g., Borges

et al., 2001; Buforn et al., 2004; Stich et al., 2005; Geissler et al.,

2010). Terrinha et al. (2009) suggested that such pattern might be

related to convergence and strain partitioning by  means of dextral

wrenching on WNW-ESE trending steep faults and thrusting on the

NE-SW trending fault  in the Gulf of Cadiz and Horseshoe Abyssal

Plain. Approaching the base of the continental slope, NNE-SSW to

N-S westerly dipping thrusts accommodate shortening in  an area

where wrenching has not been observed.

5.3. Rheology of crust and mantle

In continental lithosphere it has been observed that during rift-

ing the upper crust is  deformed by faulting while the lower crust

generally supports ductile deformation (e.g., Odedra et al., 2001;

Moeller et al., 2013). The transition from brittle to ductile defor-

mation depends on the temperature structure and the rock type.

Earthquakes are generally restricted to domains of brittle defor-

mation. The fact that earthquakes in  the Gulf of Cadiz occur within

the lower crust and the upper mantle supports elastic rheology for

both domains. Thus, both the lower crust and upper mantle are

strong. This interpretation is supported by very low crustal heat

flow of&amp;lt;50 mW/m2 (Grevemeyer et al., 2009), resulting in cooler

geotherms than generally found in rift basins (e.g., McKenzie, 1978)

and hence favouring elastic rheology.

Brittle deformation in the oceanic mantle is a  common features

and generally restricted to temperatures&amp;lt;600 ?C (e.g., McKenzie

et al., 2005; Craig et al., 2014). Thus, only near mid-ocean ridges is

seismicity confined to crustal levels (e.g., Grevemeyer et al., 2013).

Crustal deformation of mature oceanic lithosphere may  cause brit-

tle deformation to extend until depths of several tens of kilometres

into the mantle (Lefeldt et al., 2009; Craig et al., 2014). In  our study

the majority of earthquakes rupturing within the mantle occurred

landward of the domain of Jurassic oceanic crust, either in  the

60-km-wide continent-ocean transition zone or in the continen-

tal domain near the coast line as defined by seismic data (Sallares

et al., 2011; Martinez-Loriente et al., 2014;  Fig.  1).

Earthquakes in  the continental domain of the South Iberia mar-

gin are focused in the lower crust and uppermost mantle. Neves and

Neves (2009) suggested that flexural loading caused by density con-

trasts between adjacent oceanic and continental crust may  cause

flexure and hence deformation. In their model compressive stresses

and deformation concentrates below Moho. However, some of  the

best located earthquakes occur in the continent-ocean transitions

zone (line-km 160–190 in Fig. 5) at ?40 km depth where the flex-

ural model of Neves and Neves (2009) predicts tensile stresses. In

contrast, observed focal mechanisms support thrusting and hence

compression.

Seismicity and brittle deformation in both oceanic and continen-

tal mantle off  southern Iberia seems to be a common feature and

have been revealed using a wide range of techniques, including

regional waveform modelling (Stich et al., 2005) and local moni-

toring of seismicity using our amphibious network. Elsewhere in

continental lithosphere earthquakes occurring at mantle depth are

known to  be  rare. It was therefore inferred that the continental

mantle is  rather weak and probably related to higher water content

(Maggi et al., 2000). Mantle earthquakes, however, were detected

beneath the East African Rift at 53–60 km  (Lindenfeld and Rümpker,

2011), but might be associated to  deep-seated magmatic processes.

Recently, Alinaghi and Krüger (2014) confirmed the occurrence

of some earthquakes in continental mantle below the Tien Shan,

Central Asia, supporting a strong lower crust and upper mantle.

5.4. Seismic quiescence of the Gulf of Cadiz sedimentary prism

and SWIM faults

A large number of ocean-bottom-seismometers was  placed on

the accretionary prism of the Gulf of Cadiz (Fig. 2; Gutscher et al.,

2002; Thiebot and Gutscher, 2006). Seismically the area remained

inactive, both during the time of our deployment and during the

much longer time scale of seismicity recorded by national networks

in Portugal and Spain (Fig. 8).  Seven OBS (no. 37–43) where located

on top of the main SWIM fault running through the centre of the

Gulf (labelled SWIM1  in  Figs. 1 and 2). These stations were deployed

as a dense array with a  station separation of&amp;lt;10 km.  Nevertheless,

they did not reveal any earthquakes within the network that cluster

along the fault. However, some events farther west but outside of

the network might be associated with the SWIM1  fault. One inter-

pretation would be that  both the subduction thrust and the SWIM

faults are  largely inactive. However, large strike-slip faults might

be segmented, like the San Andreas Fault in  California (e.g., Bennett

et al., 2004). Consequently, the segment of the SWIM fault covered

by the network might be either inactive, creeping or being lock,

while farther west, where a number of earthquakes cluster in the

vicinity of the fault, earthquakes may  indicate fault activity.

The idea of active subduction in  the Gulf of Cadiz is still under

debate. Plate tectonic reconstructions of the Western Mediter-

ranean suggests that the Oligocene/Miocene evolution was  driven

by subduction and slab roll-back (e.g., Faccenna et al., 2001). A

remaining slab of eastward subduction has been imaged under

the western Alboran Sea (e.g., Garcia-Castellanos and Villasen?or,

2011; Bezada et al., 2013) and geochemical studies of  magmatic

rocks from the Alboran Sea suggest that subduction related vol-

canism occurred until Miocene times (Duggen et al., 2003, 2004).

The existence of a Miocene magmatic arc in the Alboran Sea has

been supported by seismic reflection imaging (Booth-Rea et al.,

2007). However, arc magmatism in the Alboran Sea stopped in  the

Miocene (Duggen et al., 2003, 2004) and the stratigraphic analysis

of seismic data from the Gulf of Cadiz may  support the interpreta-

tion that accretion has stopped several million years ago (Iribarren

et al., 2007). This conclusion is sustained by simulating the tectonic

reconstruction of the western Mediterranean using 3-D numeri-

cal modelling, indicating that  subduction roll-back is stalled since

Tortonian (?8 Ma)  (Chertova et al., 2014). In terms of these results

it seems reasonable to  suggest that subduction has largely ceased

and hence the former megathrust might be seismically inactive.

However, a  lack of seismicity itself cannot be used to  argue that

subduction ceased. For example, a number of subduction megath-

rusts remain seismically inactive, like the Cascadia subduction zone

offshore of Oregon and British Columbia. Tsunami deposit found

in the trench of Cascadia and even thousands of kilometres away

in Japan suggest that Cascadia suffers from a major magnitude

M ? 9 earthquake every 300–800 years (Satake et al., 1996, 2003).

Thus, depending on convergence rate, such settings may  support

catastrophic earthquakes with large recurrence intervals of several

hundreds to thousands of years. Consequently, the observed qui-

escence to the south of 36?N cannot be used to rule out a  future

megathrust earthquake.

Zitellini et al. (2009) presented the SWIM faults as being a devel-

oping plate boundary. The fact that the plate boundary is  yet not

fully developed has been indicated by  current stress indicators, like

GPS  velocities and earthquake rates (Cunha et al., 2012). However,

an alternative interpretation might be that the SWIM faults com-

prise several smaller fault segments rather than acting like  a  single

600 km long faults zone. The fact that some segments of the SWIM

faults are actively slipping is  supported by  seismic reflection imag-

ing (Bartolome et al., 2012)  and probably by a number of not  so

well located earthquakes to  the west of the network. In addition,

Geissler et al. (2010) reported a  single strike-slip mechanism in  the

vicinity of the SWIM1  fault. Thus, the observed seismicity pattern

and the lack of seismicity along major parts of the fault could also

be interpreted as being related to a  segmented fault and the seismic

cycle. Today, we know that  earthquakes are the result of a  stick–slip

frictional instability (Brace and Byerlee, 1966),  where “the earth-

quake is the ‘slip’ and the ‘stick’ is the interseismic period of elastic

strain accumulation” (Scholtz, 1998). Within the cycle, the inter-

seismic stain accumulation might be aseismic. Such features were

observed along the most prominent fault in the Gulf of Almeria – the

100 km long northeast-southwest trending left-lateral strike-slip

Carboneras Fault (Gràcia et al., 2006). The fault remained seismi-

cally inactive during a  5 months long seismic monitoring campaign

(Grevemeyer et al., 2015). However, the Carboneras Fault is asso-

ciated with a number of historic earthquakes, affecting the city

of Almeria in southern Spain. Furthermore, geomorphic features

found along the strike-slip fault clearly indicated active motion

(Gràcia et al., 2006). In terms of the evidence found at the Carbon-

eras Fault, we suggest that the SWIM faults mimic  the Carboneras

Fault. Thus, they might be either creeping or accumulating strain

being released in future seismic activity.

5.5. A passive-aggressive margin or an active plate boundary?

The features discussed above clearly indicate that seismicity

along the southern Iberia margin resembles activity found along

the passive continental margins of the eastern US (Zoback, 1992;

Wolin et al., 2012) and Brazil (Assumpcao et al., 2011); the main

differences being that earthquakes tend to occur at crustal levels

along the American passive margins, while most events in the Gulf

of Cadiz rupture at mantle depth. Moreover, the rate of seismicity

off Iberia is much higher.

An active plate boundary or STEP fault (Govers and Wortel,

2005) running from the Betics into the Gulf of Cadiz would favour a

rather continuous band of seismicity. However, it is observed that

seismicity and deformation is spread over a  wider area rather than

representing a discrete fault (e.g., Sartori et al., 1994; Hayward

et al., 1999),  supporting a rather diffusive plate boundary. Alter-

natively, Terrinha et al. (2009) advocated a regional (large scale)

strain partitioning scenario, suggesting that the WNW-ESE conver-

gence between both plates is  simultaneously accommodated by (i)

right-lateral strike-slip movement (along the SWIM fault system)

and (ii) thrusting along NNE-SSW to  N-S directed faults. Either, a

rather diffusive plate boundary or strain partitioning may  explain

the much higher rate of seismicity off Iberia when compared to

other passive margins. Besides, passive margins are generally sev-

eral thousands of kilometres from any plate boundary and hence in

the plate interior. In  contrast, the south Iberian margin is situated

about 100–200 km off Africa. Thus, normal passive margins suffer

from far field stresses, while southern Iberia suffers from regional

stresses caused by collision.

The fact that mantle earthquakes dominate in the Gulf of Cadiz

might be caused by deformation associated with a rather unique

setting. First, the Triassic to  Jurassic age of the margin makes Iberia

one of the oldest passive margins. Second, collision is  generally not

associated with active subduction. Third, in  the center of  the Gulf

of Cadiz a  fragment of Jurassic oceanic lithosphere (Fig. 1; Sallares

et al., 2011; Martinez-Loriente et al., 2014)  is sandwiched between

African and Eurasian continental lithosphere. Thus, convergence

between both continents will push thick Jurassic oceanic litho-

sphere against Triassic continental lithosphere. Shortening and

deformation of such old and hence rigid lithosphere may  cause

intense deformation at mantle depth, explaining the large number

of mantle earthquakes.

If the margin parallel seismicity would be related to  an active

STEP fault (Govers and Wortel, 2005) and westward slab retreat

(e.g. Gutscher, 2004; Gutscher et al., 2012), we would expect a

rather continuous band of seismicity outlining a major active fault.

However, neither the Portuguese nor the Spanish national cata-

logues indicate such features, but show two  unrelated clusters

of activity at the Algarve margin and in the Betics (Fig. 8). An

inactive STEP fault would be supported by stalled subduction and

slab retreat (Chertova et al., 2014). Off the Algarve coast to the

west of 7?W, earthquakes are co-located with a  prominent grav-

ity anomaly, supporting that seismicity is related to pre-existing

features of the passive margin that are re-activated by the con-

vergence between Africa and Eurasia (Zitellini et al., 2004). A  new

plate boundary fault may  develop further south (Zitellini et al.,

2009)  along the SWIM faults. We  therefore suggest classifying the

margin of southern Iberia as a rather active and hence seismically

aggressive-passive margin.

6. Conclusions

An  amphibious micro-seismicity survey was conducted in the

northern Gulf of Cadiz and Algarve passive margin, indicating that

the majority of earthquakes was either located in the lower crust

or the upper mantle. Roughly 50% of the detected events occurred

either in  the oceanic mantle of Jurassic lithosphere or beneath the

continent-ocean transition zone and continental crust of the south

Algarve-Iberia margin.

(i) Seismicity pattern supports a  strong lower crust and upper

continental mantle.

(ii) We consider the margin as a  rather active or “aggressive” pas-

sive margin where pre-existing faults are re-activated by the

African/Eurasian plate convergence. This conclusion is  sup-

ported by the fact that seismicity found along the Algarve

margin mimics the fault pattern along the passive margin of

the Eastern US (Zoback, 1992; Wolin et al., 2012) and Eastern

Brazil (Assumpcao et al., 2011).

(iii) Little evidence was  found that the SWIM faults, as lithospheric

scale W-E  trending strike-slip faults, were seismically active

during the offshore deployment.

(iv) We did not observe any earthquakes supporting an active east-

ward dipping subduction zone.

ABSTRACT

We report on newly discovered mud volcanoes located at ~4500 m water depth ~90 km west 

of the deformation front of the accretionary wedge of the Gulf of Cadiz, and thus outside of 

their typical geotectonic environment. Seismic data suggest that fluid flow is mediated by a 

&gt;400-km-long strike-slip fault marking the transcurrent plate boundary between Africa and 

Eurasia. Geochemical data (Cl, B, Sr, 87Sr/86Sr, ?18O, ?D) reveal that fluids originate in oceanic 

crust older than 140 Ma. On their rise to the surface, these fluids receive strong geochemical 

signals from recrystallization of Upper Jurassic carbonates and clay-mineral dehydration in 

younger terrigeneous units. At present, reports of mud volcanoes in similar deep-sea settings 

are rare, but given that the large area of transform-type plate boundaries has been barely 

investigated, such pathways of fluid discharge may provide an important, yet unappreciated 

link between the deeply buried oceanic crust and the deep ocean.

INTRODUCTION

Fluid seepage and mud volcanism are common 

at active and passive continental margins (Kopf, 

2002); typical driving mechanisms are (1) rapid 

sedimentation in combination with compaction 

and tectonic stress, (2) intrusive processes like 

salt diapirism, (3) dewatering of hydrous min-

erals, and (4) formation of hydrocarbons. These 

factors are met in the Gulf of Cadiz, where sev-

eral kilometer-thick Mesozoic to Holocene sedi-

ments accumulated in an accretionary wedge, 

hosting numerous mud volcanoes (MVs) prefer-

entially at fault intersections (Fig. 1; Magalhães 

et al., 2012). Proximal to the coast, MV fluids 

are strongly influenced by clay-mineral dehy-

dration and leaching of Upper Triassic evapo-

rites (Haffert et al., 2013). With increasing dis-

tance from the coast, the fluid signature changes, 

and fluid interaction with the underlying oceanic 

crust was postulated based on results from the 

Porto MV (Scholz et al., 2009). The occurrence 

of MVs located at water depths &gt;2500 m is 

closely tied to the presence of active strike-slip 

faults (Duarte et al., 2013; Fig. 1), which pro-

vide deeply rooted fluid pathways (Hensen et 

al., 2007). In 2012, R/V Meteor cruise M86/5 

was conducted to test hypothesized fluid seep-

age along deep-rooted strike-slip faults also in 

distal segments outside the accretionary wedge. 

Our findings call for a reappraisal of oceanic 

transform-type faults as fluid conduits and sup-

port current hypotheses about ongoing fluid cir-

culation in “aged” upper oceanic crust.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS

Acoustic backscatter anomalies recorded 

during previous bathymetric surveys led to the 

discovery of three new MVs on cruise M86/5: 

Abzu, Tiamat, and Michael Ivanov (ATI MVs 

hereafter; Fig. 1A) at water depths of ~4500 m 

at the southern rim of the Horseshoe Valley, ~90 

km west of the deformation front of the accre-

tionary wedge (Fig. 1A; Duarte et al., 2013). 

These MVs are smaller than those found on 

the accretionary wedge and consist of isolated 

cones (Fig. 1B) aligned on the Lineament South 

(LS) trend (Bartolome et al., 2012; Terrinha et 

al., 2009). The position of the MVs along the 

LS fault coincides with a seismically active zone 

with earthquakes of magnitudes M
w
 ?6 nucle-

ating in the upper mantle between 40 km and 

60 km depth (Fig. 1A; Geissler et al., 2010). 

This suggests a fault intersection scenario simi-

lar to the situation on the accretionary wedge. 

Five gravity cores of up to 4.75 m length were 

obtained from active fluid emanation sites at ATI 

and Porto MVs (see Appendix DR1 in the GSA 

Data Repository1). Pore water was extracted in 

intervals ?25 cm and analyzed for major and 

minor element composition using standard ana-

lytical procedures (Appendix DR2; e.g., Scholz 

et al., 2009). MV sediments typically consist of 

olive-gray mud breccias with claystone clasts 

of millimeter to centimeter size, and are highly 

enriched in H
2
S and methane. Gas hydrates are 

found below the zone of anaerobic oxidation 

of methane (AOM). Dissolved methane escap-

ing from the MV sediment forms plumes above 

the seafloor and feeds chemosymbiotic assem-

blages including several species of bivalves and 

tubeworms (Cunha et al., 2013).

FLUID SOURCES AND IMPLICATIONS

At ATI MVs, a shallow AOM zone prevails 

(40–200 cm sediment depth) due to advection 

of methane-rich fluids. Below the AOM zone, 

mixing with ambient bottom water is minor so 

that the chemical composition of rising deep flu-

ids can be studied on samples from this depth, 

defined as “local endmembers” of a core (e.g., 

Scholz et al., 2009). Local endmembers from 

four cores sampled on cruise M86/5 at ATI MVs 

and one core from Porto MV were selected and 

compared to previously published (Hensen et 

al., 2007; Scholz et al., 2009) local endmembers 

from MVs on the accretionary wedge (Fig. 2; 

Appendix DR1; distal MVs: Carlos Ribeiro 

[CRMV], Bonjardim, Porto; proximal MVs: 

Mercator, Captain Arutyunov [CAMV]).

Fluid data reveal positive and negative corre-

lations of ?18O and Cl versus B (Fig. 2A) and 

?18O versus ?D (Fig. 2B), respectively. Such 

trends are typical for clay-mineral dehydra-

tion, a major fluid source in the Gulf of Cadiz 

(Hensen et al., 2007). Clay dehydration causes 

freshening of fluids (depletion of conservative 

elements such as Cl), a characteristic signal 

of ?18O above and ?D below standard seawa-

ter composition (Vienna standard mean ocean 

water, VSMOW), as well as enrichments of 

boron and other fluid-mobile elements (Dähl-

mann and de Lange, 2003).

Similarly, MV endmembers of Sr (Fig. 2C) 

and 87Sr/86Sr ratios (Fig. 2D) were plotted versus 

Cl. Data from non-ATI MVs in Figure 2C show 

a similar relationship as in Figures 2A and 2B,

and can be defined by mixing between a certain 

range of Sr-enriched clay endmembers and sea 

water (shaded area Fig. 2C). This suggests that 

Sr is also derived from clay dehydration. By 

contrast, ATI MV fluids are clearly offset from 

this trend. Explaining this offset by mixing of 

clay-mineral–derived water and seawater would 

require an unrealistically strong Sr source in 

clays. Moreover, Sr released from clays has a 

high (radiogenic) 87Sr/86Sr ratio (Scholz et al., 

2009; Appendix DR3) so that a strong Sr input 

from clays at ATI MVs should cause a positive 

offset in the isotopic signature, which is not the 

case (Fig. 2D). Instead, the 87Sr/86Sr signal of 

fluids at all distal MVs indicate the decreasing 

influence of clay-mineral dewatering (Scholz 

et al., 2009) suggesting a low (less radiogenic) 
87Sr/86Sr ratio of the source at ATI MVs. Two 

possible sources of Sr can induce such a low 
87Sr/86Sr signal in this geological setting: deeply 

buried oceanic crust, and recrystallization of 

Mesozoic carbonates. Sr concentrations in 

hydrothermal vent fluids vary between 80 µM 

and 300 µM (Butterfield et al., 1994; Camp-

bell et al., 1988; Mottl et al., 2000; Von Damm, 

1990), which is below the level measured in 

most of the MV fluids. Therefore, oceanic crust 

is unlikely to be the dominant source of Sr at the 

ATI MVs. Pore waters of (pelagic) limestones 

can be enriched in Sr by &gt;1 mM. The Sr enrich-

ment is related to recrystallization (Gieskes and 

Lawrence, 1981) of Sr-rich, meta-stable arago-

nite to Sr-poor, stable calcite. The 87Sr/86Sr ratio 

of fluids affected by this process may be as low 

as 0.7068 (87Sr/86Sr of Upper Jurassic seawater 

and carbonates; Banner, 2004). Seismostratig-

raphy calibrated with results of nearby Deep 

Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Site 135 (Fig. 1) 

shows an exceptionally thick (2.5 km) sequence 

of Upper Jurassic sediments on top of the oce-

anic basement below the ATI MVs (Fig. 1C; 

Martínez-Loriente et al., 2013). Evidence from 

DSDP Site 105 (Hollister et al., 1972), the west-

ern Atlantic counterpart to Site 135, suggests 

that Upper Jurassic sediments in the study area 

are indeed pelagic limestones.

To further explore how potential sources 

may affect the MV fluid compositions, we 

examine a plot of Sr/B versus 87Sr/86Sr (Fig. 3). 

This combination of parameters allows for a 

clear discrimination between (1) clay (strongly 

radiogenic 87Sr/86Sr), (2) carbonates (87Sr/86Sr 

between present-day and the Late Jurassic 

Ocean; high Sr/B), and (3) oceanic crust (well-

defined, strongly non-radiogenic 87Sr/86Sr) as 

potential sources. The fluid composition of the 

proximal MVs is close to the suggested end-

member of clay-mineral dewatering, while that 

of ATI MVs shows a strong imprint of recrystal-

lization of Upper Jurassic carbonates (Fig. 3). 

The distal, non-ATI MVs plot within the binary 

mixing field of “clay” and “crust”, suggesting 

a negligible influence of carbonate recrystalli-

zation there. This interpretation is in line with 

stratigraphic evidence for the subsurface exten-

sion of Upper Jurassic sediments (Fig. 4). Con-

sequently, only ATI MVs receive the strong sig-

nal from carbonate recrystallization.

Unlike clay minerals, sedimentary carbonates 

do not store water in their lattice, and the pro-

cess of recrystallization only enriches ambient 

pore waters in Sr. Therefore, an additional trans-

port mechanism is required to carry the signal 

of carbonate recrystallization to the seafloor. 

Freshwater release from clay is presumably 

low in carbonate-rich sediments. In addition, 

clay-mineral dehydration occurs at tempera-

tures between 60 °C and 150 °C (Hensen et 

al., 2007), which translates into sub-seafloor 

depths of ~1–3 km (geothermal gradient 45–50 

K km–1; Appendix DR4; Grevemeyer et al., 

2009). Thus, there is only a limited overlap 

with the Upper Jurassic sediments (2–4.5 km 

sub-seafloor depth). As the Upper Jurassic unit 

corresponds to the deepest sedimentary depos-

its located right above the oceanic crust, only 

a scenario where crustal-derived fluids carry 

the geochemical signals upward (mixing of all 

three sources in Fig. 3) can explain observed

fluid compositions. Such a scenario is in com-

pliance with the evidence for crustal alteration 

in MV fluids in the Gulf of Cadiz (Scholz et 

al., 2009). Our observations are summarized 

in a synthetic cross section (Fig. 4). Overall, 

fluids at Porto MV carry the strongest signal 

from oceanic crust alteration (Fig. 3), which is 

in agreement with the thinnest sediment cover 

at this site (Fig. 4). Compared to all other sites, 

there is also an obvious negative offset in ?18O 

values at this location. Negative shifts in ?18O, 

i.e., opposite to the effect observed during clay 

dehydration, are typical for mineral hydration 

processes such as the alteration of volcanic ash 

or oceanic crust (Gieskes and Lawrence, 1981). 

This trend is hardly visible at ATI MVs, likely 

due to the strong imprint of carbonate recrystal-

lization favoring the formation of 18O-enriched 

fluids at elevated temperatures (Lawrence et al., 

1975) and counteracting any negative crustal-

derived ?18O signal.

In spite of the clear geochemical evidence, the 

precise mechanism driving fluid flow remains 

elusive. The major strike-slip fault (LS) pro-

vides a deep-reaching, permeable conduit that 

serves as pathway for ascending fluids. Strike-

slip faulting has been previously suggested as a 

mechanism for the release of overpressure, even-

tually leading to pulses of fluid flow (Mazzini et 

al., 2009; Sibson, 1987; Viola et al., 2005). Deep 

seismic activity in the vicinity of ATI MVs (Fig. 

1) indeed supports this hypothesis. In addition, 

pore water convection, related to the existence of 

local basement highs (e.g., Coral Patch Ridge; 

Figs. 1 and 4), could provide an alternative sce-

nario of crustal-derived flow. To date, examples 

for fluid convection are mainly reported from 

the eastern Pacific, where pore fluids circulate 

through interconnected seamounts in young 

oceanic crust (Fisher et al., 2003).

CONCLUSIONS

Our findings confirm that seismogenic strike-

slip faults provide pathways for deep-seated flu-

ids, sustaining mud volcanism even in abyssal 

regions, outside areas of rapid sediment accu-

mulation. Moreover, strike-slip faults tap fluid 

sources in oceanic crust older than 140 Ma, 

contradicting previous assumptions that fluid 

circulation terminates at a crustal age of ca. 65 

± 10 Ma (Stein et al., 1995). Although the exact 

mechanism remains poorly constrained, our data 

provide evidence for fluid flow within old oce-

anic crust in an area of strong topographic con-

trasts and deep basement faults as suggested by 

Von Herzen (2004). Interestingly, MVs expel-

ling geochemically distinct fluids off the Barba-

dos Accretionary Prism (Godon et al., 2004) are 

found in a tectonic setting comparable to that 

in the Gulf of Cadiz. Those are aligned along 

a major fracture zone and it was suggested that 

mud volcanism was initiated by changes in plate 

motion along this fracture (Sumner and West-

brook, 2001). Globally, transform-type plate 

boundaries are of similar length as divergent 

and convergent plate boundaries (Bird, 2003) 

and the latter are known for intense vent and 

seep activity. We suggest that transform-type 

plate boundaries and fracture zones may also 

provide important pathways for fluid exchange 

between the lithosphere and the deep ocean, and 

hence deserve more intense future exploration 

to evaluate their role in terms of heat and ele-

ment exchange.

Analog and numerical modeling experiments were carried out to investigate the tectonic interference be-

tween intersecting major active strike–slip and thrust faults in the Gulf of Cadiz (Africa–Eurasia plate bound-

ary, offshore SW Iberia). The obtained results show that newly mapped tectonic features located in the fault

intersection area (corner zone) consist mostly in oblique (dextral-reverse) faults that accommodate signifi-

cant strain partitioning. Modeling of this corner-zone faults show that they have endured some degree of

rotation, displaying successive evolving geometries and kinematics. Numerical modeling results further

show that an interbedded shallow soft layer, accounting for a regional (Late Miocene) gravitational “Chaotic”

unit, could explain the mild bathymetric expression of the fault pattern in the corner-zone. Moreover, a

recognized depth discrepancy, between the (upper crust) interference fault-pattern and the (lithospheric

mantle) seismicity, is interpreted as a manifestation of similar thrust–wrench tectonic interference at differ-

ent lithospheric depths. Accordingly, an intermediate lower crust–upper mantle aseismic (i.e. softened)

depth-domain could be explained by pervasive alteration/serpentinization, prompted by fluid percolation

through fault-related fractures associated with the newly revealed corner zone fault-network. Overall

obtained results reinforce the relevance of a thrust–wrench multi-rupture seismic scenario as the main

cause for the moderate seismicity (Mwb6.0) in the study area.

1. Introduction

The Gulf of Cadiz (Fig. 1A) has long been considered a key domain
to unravel the complex tectonics of the Eurasia–Africa plate boundary
(e.g. Duarte et al., 2011; Gràcia et al., 2003a,b; Gutscher et al., 2002,
2009a,b; Rosas et al., 2009; Sallarès et al., 2011; Sartori et al., 1994;
Terrinha et al., 2003, 2009; Tortella et al., 1997; Zitellini et al., 2001,
2004, 2009). It corresponds to a specific segment of this boundary
characterized by the interplay between the Iberia and Nubia subplates,
connecting the (Atlantic) transform Gloria Fault, to the West, with the
dextral transpressive Rif–Tell shear zone (Morel and Meghraoui, 1996)
to the East of Straits of Gibraltar, and across the Betic–Rif orogenic arc.

In the Gulf of Cadiz domain, the Iberia–Nubia plate boundary has been
considered of a diffuse nature (e.g. Medialdea et al., 2004; Sartori et
al., 1994). Accordingly, present day WNW–ESE convergence between
both plates at a ~4–5 mm/yr rate, (e.g. Fernandes et al., 2007; Nocquet
and Calais, 2004; Serpelloni et al., 2007; Stich et al., 2006, gray line in
the inset of Fig. 1B) is here accommodated by a considerable number
of widespread and differently orientated active tectonic structures,
mostly consisting of strike–slip and thrust faults (Fig. 1B). During the
last decade, the acquisition and interpretation of geophysical data (e.g.
reflection/refraction seismics and multi-beam swath bathymetry) led
to the progressive discovery of several new morphotectonic features,
resulting in the continuous improvement of the Gulf of Cadiz tectonic
map (see Fig. 1B, Bartolome et al., accepted for publication; Duarte et
al., 2009, 2010; Gràcia et al., 2003a,b; Rosas et al., 2009; Terrinha et
al., 2003, 2009; Zitellini et al., 2004, 2009). Recently, based on a new
wide-angle refraction seismic (WAS) profile (Fig. 1B), Sallarès et al.
(2011) provided new insight on the nature of the crust across different
morphotectonic domains in the central part of the Gulf of Cadiz, and

proposed the location of the lithospheric continent–ocean boundary
(COB) at a distance of approximately 100 km from the Southern Iberian
coast line (see COB in Fig. 1B).

The seismicity that has been recorded in the Gulf of Cadiz corre-
sponds to a general scenario of moderate magnitude at shallow to in-
termediate depths (e.g. Borges et al., 2001; Buforn et al., 1995, 2004;

Engdahl et al., 1998; Fukao, 1973; Grimison and Chen, 1986; Stich et
al., 2005), in which, though, a direct correlation between earthquake
location and known major tectonic structures is not straightforward.
Large magnitude instrumental and historical events also occurred,
such as the 28/02/1969 earthquake (Ms=7.9), and the highly destruc-
tive 1755 Great Lisbon Earthquake (estimated magnitude between 8.5
and 8.8, e.g. Abe, 1979; Johnston, 1996; Solares and Arroyo, 2004), and
associated tsunami (e.g. Baptista and Miranda, 2009; Baptista et al.,
1998a,b; Terrinha et al., 2003; Zitellini et al., 2001). The recurrence inter-
val of these great events (Mw&gt;8.0) has been estimated in 1800 years

based on turbidite paleoseismology approach (Gràcia et al., 2010). In
addition, a network of broadband OBS deployed in the area during a
year, confirmed greater depths for low-magnitude local earthquakes
(40–60 km, Geissler et al., 2010), highlighting the relevance of
seismogenic mantle rheology and deep lithospheric structures, comple-
mentary to the known (i.e. mapped) shallower crustal faults. The seis-
mic and tsunami hazard posed by the high-magnitude earthquakes
continue to trigger the interest, and the need, to search for their
seismogenic sources, and hence to better understand the tectonic evo-
lution of the region.

1.1. Present work

In the study area, a new morphotectonic pattern is revealed in the
zone of intersection (corner zone) between a main regional thrust,
the so called Horseshoe Thrust Fault (Horseshoe Fault of Gràcia et
al., 2003b), and a major dextral strike–slip fault, the SWIM 1 Fault
(Zitellini et al., 2009), crossing each other and making an angle of
~120°/60° (HTF and SWIM 1in Figs. 1B, 2 and 3). The new corner
zone tectonic structures, and their correspondent geometry and kine-
matics are here interpreted as resulting from regional, active, thrust–
wrench tectonic interference. Based on the previously established re-
gional seismostratigraphy, and on newly interpreted seismotectonic
data, this assumption is tested through coupled analog, and 3D finite-
element numerical modeling. Both modeling approaches assume (brit-
tle) upper-crust mechanical interference. Obtained results are further
compared with the natural example, and ensuing implications for
the overall tectonic evolution of the Gulf of Cadiz are discussed.

2. Regional tectonic setting

In the Gulf of Cadiz tectonic map of Fig. 1B three main sets of
major faults can be recognized: 1) The thrust front that bounds the
so called Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge (GCAW, in the eastern
half of the study area, Fig. 1B); 2) a set of NE–SW striking thrust-

faults, preferably located to the west of the Horseshoe Valley (e.g.
Horseshoe Thrust Fault, Marquês de Pombal Fault, Gorringe Fault,
and Tagus Abyssal Plain Thrust); and 3) a set of WNW–ESE dextral
strike–slip faults, corresponding to the SWIM wrench system, as de-
fined by Zitellini et al. (2009).

The GCAW was interpreted as an accretionary wedge related with
the eastwards dipping (roll back) subduction of an oceanic litho-
spheric slab beneath the Gibraltar arc (Gutscher, 2004; Gutscher et
al., 2002). The same authors considered this subduction zone as the
seismogenic source of the 1755 Great Lisbon Earthquake, although its
present day activity is still intensively debated (Duarte et al., 2011;
Gràcia et al., 2003a,b; Gutscher, 2004; Gutscher et al., 2002, 2009a,b;
Terrinha et al., 2003, 2009; Zitellini et al., 2004, 2009).

The set of NE–SW thrusts includes the studied northwest-directed
Horseshoe Thrust Fault (see Fig. 1B) that is considered one of the
most significant structures in the Gulf of Cadiz, active since at least
Tortonian times (~10 My, e.g. Gràcia et al., 2003a,b; Terrinha et al.,
2009; Zitellini et al., 2004). This major thrust was previously pro-
posed to share a common detachment with other NE–SW thrusts in
the area, namely with the Marquês de Pombal Fault (MPF), with
which it was also thought to represent an alternative source for the
1755 Great Lisbon Earthquake (Gràcia et al., 2003a,b; Terrinha et al.,
2003, 2009). As a whole, these regional major thrusts (see Fig. 1B)
were firstly hypothetically interpreted by Ribeiro et al. (1996) as

early manifestations of the tectonic reactivation of the southwest Ibe-
rian margin, representing the onset of subduction initiation along this
segment of the Atlantic passive margin. More recently, Terrinha et al.
(2009) considered these same structures as part of an en-échelon
300 km long N–S trending fault system, extending between latitude
~35.5°N and 38°N. The same authors interpreted this system as the
expression of a diachronic westwards and northwards migration of
the deformation in the Gulf of Cadiz, from Late Miocene times to Pre-
sent day. Accordingly, during this period of time active deformation
would have propagated from the GCAW thrust front to the west
(e.g. HTF and Gorringe Fault), and further to the north along the SW
Iberian margin (e.g. MPF and Tagus Abyssal Plain Thrust). These same
authors also argue for the present day existence of large scale strain par-
titioning in the Gulf of Cadiz, comprising not only the activity of the NE–
SW thrust system, but also active dextral wrenching ascribed to the
WNW–ESE SWIM system.

According to Zitellini et al. (2009) the SWIM system corresponds
to a broad deformation band extending across the entire Gulf of Cadiz
domain (along 600 km), essentially characterized by sets of major
deep rooted, sub-vertical, dextral strike–slip faults (Bartolome et al.,
2012). These SWIM faults (see Fig. 1B), which are thought to be active
since at least ~1.8 My (Rosas et al., 2009), strike subparallel to the pre-
sent day convergence direction between Nubia and Iberia (WNW–ESE,
see gray line in the inset of Fig. 1B), and were interpreted as the precur-
sor of a new (dextral) transcurrent plate boundary in the Gulf of Cadiz
(Zitellini et al., 2009). Alternatively, Duarte et al. (2011) showed that

the SWIM faults are more likely to correspond to the reactivation of
the ancient Tethyan plate boundary.

In the study area the SWIM 1 Fault intersects the Horseshoe Thrust
Fault (see Fig. 1B). Hence, some kind of tectonic interference between
these two major active faults is expected to occur as a consequence.

2.1. Morphotectonic characterization of the study fault-systems

The area studied in detail in the present work is limited by the
dash-lined rectangle in Fig. 1B, whose bathymetry and tectonic inter-
pretation is depicted in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. The newly pro-
posed tectonic map of Fig. 3B corresponds mostly to the area of
intersection between the Horseshoe Thrust and the SWIM 1 faults.
This area was investigated through the detailed combined analysis
of the available multibeam swath bathymetry (SWIM compilation,
Zitellini et al., 2009), and numerous multi-channel seismic (MCS) re-
flection profiles. Sub-seafloor seismic interpretation has been essen-
tially based on the SWIM-2006 high-resolution MCS cruise carried
out on board the Spanish RV Hesperides (e.g. Bartolome et al., 2012;
Gràcia et al., 2006; Martinez-Loriente et al., 2008) complemented
with deeper penetration MCS profiles acquired during the IAM — Ibe-
rian Atlantic Margin, (e.g. Banda et al., 1995; Tortella et al., 1997) and
ARRIFANO — Arco Rifano cruise (e.g. Sartori et al., 1994). A detailed
morphological characterization of the NW Gulf of Cadiz domain,
and its several different sub-domains, was recently presented by
Terrinha et al. (2009). Consistently with their proposal, the main

large-scale bathymetric features in the study area are here inter-
preted as being tectonically controlled by the activity of the recog-
nized major fault-systems (described below, see Figs. 2 and 3).

Based on the available seismic reflection dataset, a general sei-
smostratigraphy was also previously established (e.g. Duarte et al.,
2010; Sartori et al., 1994; Terrinha et al., 2009; Torelli et al., 1997;
Tortella et al., 1997) comprising (Figs. 4 and 5): a) A basal Mesozoic
(Jurassic–Cretaceous) unit (~2 s TWTT, two way travel time)
corresponding to carbonate sediments; b) A Late Miocene gravitational
“chaotic body” unit (~1.5 s TWTT) with a semi-chaotic seismic signa-
ture, previously interpreted as an olistostrome body or as a tectonic

mélange (Iribarren et al., 2007; Terrinha et al., 2009; Torelli et al.,
1997; Tortella et al., 1997); c) A top Late Miocene to Plio-Quaternary
unit (?0.5 s TWTT), corresponding to a sequence of hemipelagic/
turbidite sedimentary cover (Gràcia et al., 2010)..

2.1.1. The Horseshoe Thrust Fault

The NE–SW trending Horseshoe Thrust Fault scarp is clearly ob-
served in the bathymetry (Fig. 2A and B), displaying a maximum height
of ca. 1000 m in its north-easternmost segment, gradually vanishing
towards the SW (Figs. 2 and 3). The SE part of the study area (mostly
coinciding with the Horseshoe Valley at depths between 4200 m and
4800 m, see Fig. 2) is interpreted to correspond to the hanging wall of
the NW directed HTF (e.g. Terrinha et al., 2009; Tortella et al., 1997;
Zitellini et al., 2004), thus tectonically uplifted relatively to its footwall,
which corresponds to the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain (HAP) in the NW half
of the study area (at depths of &gt;4800 m). In the IAM4e profile (Fig. 4),
the HTF (around shotpoint 1000 in Fig. 4) is clearly imaged as a SE dip-
ping, deep seated fault. It roots well into the Mesozoic unit, prolonging
upwards across all the other overlying units, and breaching out at the
seafloor surface, where the resulting prominent deformation is marked
by an offset of ca. 420 m (~0.6 s TWTT in the IAM4e profile). The NW di-
rected thrust kinematics is clearly shown by the geometry of the folds
affecting the Mesozoic reflectors near the fault plane, and by the unam-
biguous offset of the surface marking the top of the Mesozoic unit (see
Fig. 4). To the SE of the HTF other relatively minor thrusts affecting the
basal Mesozoic unit were previously described (e.g. Duarte et al., 2010;
Terrinha et al., 2009), although these only affect the base of the overly-
ing Late Miocene chaotic body (see Fig. 4). The same authors also report
some degree of tectonic imbrication within the Miocene chaotic body
further to SE, only mildly perturbing the seafloor morphology.

2.1.2. The SWIM 1 Fault

The SWIM system was recently described by Zitellini et al. (2009)
as corresponding to a set of WNW–ESE trending, vertical right-lateral
strike–slip faults, characterized by a hundred-kilometer long linear
bathymetric expression, ranging from the foot of the Gorringe Bank,
in the West Gulf of Cadiz, across the HAP, the Horseshoe Valley and
the GCAW, reaching its easternmost area near the Straits of Gibraltar
(see Fig. 1B). The SWIM 1 Fault (Figs. 1–3) is crossed both by the IAM4
and the IAM3 seismic profiles (Fig. 5), where it can be observed to cor-
respond to a deep-seated sub-vertical fault. It cuts across all the main
seismostratigraphic units, occasionally breaching out, and rooting in
the lower pre-Mesozoic (?) basement (at &gt;9 km depth, Bartolome et
al., accepted for publication). Some segments of the fault exhibit an
overall geometry resembling flower-like structures (Fig. 5B), agreeing
with the previously proposed transcurrent kinematics (e.g. Bartolome
et al., accepted for publication; Duarte et al., 2009; Terrinha et al.,
2009; Viola et al., 2005; Zitellini et al., 2009).

2.1.3. New interpretation of the tectonic corner zone

The SWIM 1 Fault intersects the Horseshoe thrust near its SW ter-
mination (Figs. 2 and 3). In the HAP, away from the HTF, the SWIM 1
lineament is not prominently recorded in the bathymetry. Neverthe-
less, the continuation of the correspondent basement strike–slip fault
was thoroughly mapped farther to the west, up to the foothills of the
Gorringe Bank flanking its south-western termination (see Figs. 1B
and 3B, Bartolome et al., accepted for publication; Duarte et al.,
2009; Terrinha et al., 2009). The available seismic dataset in this
specific area (see Fig. 3A) leads to a newly interpreted tectonic configu-
ration (see map of Fig. 3B) comprising a new set of faults (CF1 and CF2)
located near the corner zone of intersection between the SWIM 1
strike–slip and the Horseshoe thrust. In the IAM4 profile (Fig. 5) it is
possible to observe that these corner faults correspond to steep (south-
wards) dipping faults, rooting in the basement underneath the Mesozo-
ic unit and cutting across the overlying ones, including the base of the
Late Miocene to Plio-Quaternay top unit. In the case of CF1, the seafloor
surface is only mildly perturbed (around SP 4840 in IAM4 profile,
and black arrow in Figs. 2 and 3B), whereas CF2 lacks any kind of bathy-
metric expression. In the IAM4 profile a reverse-fault component of
movement along both CF1 and CF2 faults is apparent, revealed namely
by the offset of the upper limit of the Mesozoic unit across these faults
that clearly denounces the upward movement of the respective SE
fault blocks (see Fig. 5). Since the faults are very steep, a pure dip–slip
thrusting movement is mechanically implausible in this situation. In
contrast, oblique–slip faults, characterized by a predominantly dextral
transcurrent kinematics and a minor SE-side up thrusting component,
would fit the observed structural geometry.

Adding to this structural evidence, the recently proposed reloca-
tion of low to moderate magnitude earthquakes in the study area
(Geissler et al., 2010), showed the existence of two clusters of seis-
mic events near the northern and southern terminations of the HTF
(Fig. 6, Geissler et al., 2010). The southern cluster coincides with the
SWIM 1–HTF corner zone area, and exhibits a WNW–ESE general
trend parallel to the SWIM 1 Fault. It should be noted that the great
majority of these hypocenters are located at relatively high depths, be-
tween 40 and 55 km (red dots in Fig. 6), with only a few located out of
this depth interval (see Fig. 6: focal depthsb20 km — yellow dots;
&gt;55 km — pink dots). This shows that most of these earthquakes are
probably located in the lithospheric mantle (Geissler et al., 2010;
Sallarès et al., 2011), and thus cannot be directly linked to the faults
imaged by the MCS profiles at upper crustal levels (maximum depths
of ca. 6 km; see discussion below in Section 5). Nevertheless, the
corresponding focal mechanism solutions reported in this corner zone
domain show significant heterogeneity, possibly due to variable fault
orientation, but generally accounting for dominant reverse and strike–
slip faulting (Geissler et al., 2010).

These tectonic and seismic corner-zone manifestations are here
suggested to have formed as the result of a particular type of thrust–
wrench tectonic interference between the Horseshoe and the SWIM
systems at different depths. This interference is here investigated and
tested at upper crustal level through the analog and numerical model-
ing experiments presented below.

3. Analog modeling

Analog modeling experiments of separated wrench systems (e.g.
Dooley and McClay, 1997; Le Guerroue and Cobbold, 2006; Mandl et
al., 1977; McClay and Bonora, 2001; Richard et al., 1991; Schopfer and
Steyrer, 2001) and thrust systems (e.g. Agarwal and Agrawal, 2002;
Bonnet et al., 2007; Ellis et al., 2004; Gutscher et al., 1998a,b;
Lallemand et al., 1994; Lohrmann et al., 2003; Malavieille, 1984, 2010;
McClay et al., 2004; Mulugeta, 1988; Zhou et al., 2007) are common
and well documented. Conversely, physical modeling dealing with the
deformation caused by simultaneous thrusting and wrenching is less
common, and generally focused on a variety of different specific aspects
(e.g. Di Bucci et al., 2006, 2007; Diraison et al., 2000; Viola et al., 2004).
Hence the present work, in which sand-box analog models were pro-
duced to better understand the deformation patterns resulting from
thrust–wrench fault interference under the specific conditions of the
study area.

3.1. Experimental method

3.1.1. Material properties and scaling

Experiments were done using dry quartz sand whose properties
are summarized in Table 1. Sand is considered a Coulomb material
deforming in a brittle way according to the Coulomb fracture criterion
(e.g. Davis et al., 1983; Hubbert, 1937, 1951, Appendix A), and it has
been extensively used in scaled model experiments simulating brittle
deformation in the upper crust or other lithospheric competent levels.
Assuming a brittle behavior for the modeled upper crust, the main ma-
terial properties sustaining the dynamic similarity between this and
the sand are the internal friction (?c) and the cohesion (c0). The first is
dimensionless, and approximately the same in both model and proto-
type (see Table 1), whereas the second has dimension of stress and
must be scaled accordingly (Hubbert, 1937, and detailed explanation
in Appendix A). Thus, for negligible inertial accelerations as in the pre-
sent case, the model/prototype cohesion ratio (?) is ultimately depen-
dent on the product of correspondent density (?) and length (?) ratios,
which values are shown in Table 1 (see also Appendix A). It should be
noted that since density ratio (?) is generally close to 1 (between 0.5
and 0.7, e.g. Withjack et al., 2007) the strength of the materials
expressed by ? is scaled mostly through the length ratio (?). Given
the fact that in the present case ?=5×10?6, and since cohesion for
upper crustal rocks is clearly typically less than 50 MPa, it becomes im-
mediately evident the utility of model materials with very low cohesion
(b100 Pa), such as dry quartz sand, as analogs of upper crustal rocks.
Since brittle deformation is time independent, scaling was achieved
through considering model-prototype ratios for length (?) and mass
(?) fundamental units alone (see Table 1).

3.1.2. Apparatus, initial stage and procedure

All the experiments were carried out in the 1000×600 mm Per-
spex deformation box depicted in Fig. 7. The box consists of two
horizontal 10 mm thick basal plates (plates A and B in Fig. 7) that
move relatively to each other along the X direction, simulating a
right-lateral strike–slip (basement) fault. A thin metal sheet attached
to the base of a backstop is moved by a stepping motor also along the
X direction, sliding on top of both basal plates (Fig. 7A). The front of
this metal sheet works as a velocity discontinuity (VD) making an
angle of 60°/120° with the direction of the strike–slip fault (X direc-
tion). Two fixed lateral vertical walls confine the whole system. In

the initial stage, a layered sand cake was prepared inside the box on
top of the intersection between the basal strike–slip fault and the ve-
locity discontinuity (Fig. 7B). This was achieved by pouring batches of
differently colored sand from a moving elongated funnel (with a
width matching the one of the box), guarantying the leveling of its
top surface. In most experiments the sand cake thickness was 3 cm
(corresponding to 6 km in nature), although in several experiments
thickness of 4 and 5 cm (8 and 10 km) were also used. Layering in
the sand cake has no correspondence with any natural structures,
and was used merely as a 3D strain marker, since at the end-stage of
all the experiments the deformed sand cake was humidified, and sever-
al slices were serially cut along different chosen orientations. Likewise,
parallel (or sometimes square) line grids were also imprinted on the
top surface of the model to serve as (2D) passive strain markers.

In the present modeling the driving kinematics was conceived
to correspond to the basal right-lateral strike–slip faulting, concurring
with the natural example where the dextral SWIM faults are observed
to strike subparallel to the present day convergence between Iberia
and Nubia as shown by the reported geodetic data (e.g. Fernandes
et al., 2007; Nocquet and Calais, 2004; Serpelloni et al., 2007; Stich et
al., 2006, see gray line in the inset of Fig. 1B). It was assumed for all
the experiments that when the SWIM fault system was active, a mor-
photectonic expression of the Horseshoe Thrust Fault already existed.
This complies with the previously reported concept of counterclockwise
rotation of the convergence direction between Iberia and Nubia
subplates, from NW–SE in Late Miocene times, to Present day WNW–
ESE (e.g. Duarte et al., 2011; Terrinha et al., 2009). Such rotation agrees
with the notion of the NE–SW thrusting initiation being older than the
WNW–ESE wrenching tectonic activity (Rosas et al., 2009; Terrinha
et al., 2009; Zitellini et al., 2009). Furthermore, the interpretation of
seismostratigraphic and tectonic overprint relationships, also shows
the HTF to be active since at least Tortonian times (~10 My, e.g. Gràcia
et al., 2003a,b; Terrinha et al., 2009; Zitellini et al., 2004), whereas the
SWIM fault system only since ~1.8 My (Rosas et al., 2009; Terrinha et
al., 2009). In accordance, all the experiments comprised the following
two successive steps (see Fig. 7A and C):

1) A preliminary step that consisted in moving the backstop (and the
attached thin metal sheet) along the X direction to the left, only
until a few thrusts were observed to form breaching out at the
top surface of the sand cake (Fig. 7C — step 1). This was done to
produce an initial planar week anisotropy representing the origi-
nal geometry of the HTF system, at an angle of 60/120° with the
basal (SWIM) strike–slip direction.

2) A second step wherein the basal plates were moved relatively to
each other (also along X), by pushing the farthest plate (basal
plate A) to the right (Fig. 7C — step 2), producing a right-lateral
movement along the vertical contact surface between both basal
plates, simulating the SWIM 1 basement strike–slip fault.

During step 2, the central (“corner zone”) domain of basal plate A was
limited by two main kinematically active boundaries: one corresponding
to the trace of the basal strike–slip fault, and the other to the velocity dis-
continuity (see Fig. 7A and C). Since the dextral strike–slip along the con-
tact with plate B was accomplished by moving plate A to the right,
the boundary between this plate and the over-sliding thin metal sheet
(velocity discontinuity) corresponded to a convergent limit between
the sand above basal plate A, and the sand sitting on top of the thin
metal sheet (edged by the velocity discontinuity). Thus, the driving
forces for deformation in the sand came from the relative movement be-
tween the sliding basal plates and the thin metal sheet, which were both
in frictional contact with the overlying sand. As a result, during the sec-
ond experimental step, the sand cake on top of the boundary between
both basal plates endured dextral wrenching deformation, whereas
simultaneously shortening accommodated by thrusting occurred in the
sand above the velocity discontinuity. Stepping motors were used to
move both the backstop and the basal plates at a constant velocity

(~20 cm/h). The dimensions of the deformation box were sufficiently
large to guarantee that the bulk of the model was not affected by
boundary effects, and experiments were repeated several times to en-
sure the consistency of the obtained results. Besides photos of serially
cut sections of the (end-stage) deformed models, top view photographs
were also taken at regular time intervals as the experiments unfolded.

3.2. Experimental results

The main results are depicted in Figs. 8 and 9. In the experiments
of Fig. 8A, B and C modeled crustal thickness was of 10, 8 and 6 km,
respectively, scaled down to corresponding sand layer thickness of
5, 4 and 3 cm. This slight variation in the assumed crustal thickness
was considered to comply with the inferences from the seismic re-
flection dataset. However, obtained results show that this did not
have any significant influence on the experimentally obtained struc-
tural pattern (see below). During the first experimental step a pop-
up structure always formed, bounded by a pair of opposite ~30° dip-
ping (fore and back) thrusts, rooting in the velocity discontinuity
(Fig. 8A1). During the second experimental step, different types of
structures were simultaneously formed in the different areas of the
model analyzed below.

3.2.1. Thrust-front and wrenching domains

In the area in front of the main thrust and relatively away from the
corner zone (thrust-front domain depicted in Fig. 8), the incremental
accumulation of shortening resulting from moving basal plate A to
the right could no longer be exclusively accommodated by the origi-
nal pair of thrusts (forethrust and backthrust) formed during experi-
mental step1 (Fig. 8A1), and thus new forethrusts were successively
formed (Fig. 8A2–A3 and B–C). As is classically the case in these type of
experiments (e.g. Bonini et al., 2000; Koyi and Maillot, 2007; Lohrmann
et al., 2003; Maillot and Koyi, 2006; Persson and Sokoutis, 2002) each
new thrust rooted in the VD and accommodated a certain amount of
shortening, before being transported along the backthrust fault plane
when a newer forethrust was formed, leading to the end-term situation
depicted in Fig. 9B (cross section 6).

Simultaneously, in the sand cake above the basal strike–slip fault
(wrenching domain as defined in Fig. 8), the first formed structures
were en-échelon Riedel faults (Riedel, 1929, R-faults in Fig. 8A2) ori-
entated at low angles to the basement strike–slip direction (15° to 20°
for the first increments of deformation). Between these, several P-faults
also developed. Offset of parallel lines on model surface by R and P faults
showed a synthetic (dextral) strike–slip component of movement along
these structures. Further strike–slip increments (Fig. 8A3) originated
Y-faults that formed parallel to the basement fault direction, cut the
early R and P-faults, and also exhibited dextral strike–slip kinematics.
As shear strain accumulated, the surface area between the R-faults
rose significantly (compare the topography of Fig. 8A2 and A3) originat-
ing a deformation band parallel to the basement fault with a character-
istic surface morphology, comprising several sub-parallel elongated
bulges (see Fig. 8A3). Subsequent strike–slip increments mostly pro-
duced a continued reduction of the width of the previously formed
deformation band, besides the amplification of its relief. In cross sec-
tions cut perpendicular to the deformation band (Fig. 9 — cross sections
1 and 2) the observed overall fault pattern corresponded to an upwards
splaying from the basement fault, typically defining a flower structure.
Within this, R-faults exhibited some degree of reverse component
of movement, in line with an oblique (dextral-reverse) kinematics, al-
though in the complete absence of any externally induced compression.
These structures are typical of wrench fault systems, and confirm previ-
ous standard modeling results (e.g. Dooley and McClay, 1997; Le
Guerroue and Cobbold, 2006; Mandl et al., 1977; McClay and Bonora,
2001; Richard et al., 1991; Schopfer and Steyrer, 2001; Viola et al.,
2004). Specifically, the occurrence of oblique dextral-reverse kinemat-
ics along helicoidal R-faults in the absence of any externally induced

compression, was previously explained as a result of 5–10% of dilatation
in the sand, which is also thought to occur in a similar degree in brittle
natural rocks (e.g. Dufréchou et al., 2011; Le Guerroue and Cobbold,
2006; Schopfer and Steyrer, 2001).

3.2.2. Corner zone

In the corner zone (as defined in Fig. 8), a lateral propagation of
the thrust faults (F2, F3… Fn) into the wrenching domain was consis-
tently observed, characterized by a rotation of these faults towards an

further detailed explanation.

orientation sub-parallel to the basal strike – slip direction (i.e. X axis,
e.g. F2 in Fig. 8A2 and B; F3 in Fig. 8C). This parallelization occurred
from relatively early strike – slip increments, and displayed a clock-
wise rotation of about 60° around an inflection point (IP in Fig. 8A2,
B and C). Offset of parallel strain marker lines along these rotated
fault segments is consistent with a dextral strike – slip component
of movement. In sections cut across the same structures (Fig. 9 —
cross sections 3–5), it was apparent that these also maintained a thrust-
ing component, consistently with general dextral-reverse oblique kine-
matics (e.g. F5 in cross sections 3 and 4 of Fig. 9). In some experiments,
strain accommodation in the corner zone implied the formation of new
forethrusts in front of previously rotated fault segments (e.g. F3 and F2
respectively in corner zone domain of Fig. 8A3), which as a result ceased
to propagate and were passively thrusted in the hanging wall of the
newer thrust-faults. Subsequently, these newer thrusts were them-
selves rotated also towards the basal strike–slip fault direction, mimick-
ing the rotation of the previous ones. For further strike–slip increments,
the early formed structures in the corner zone were overprinted by
the later deformation and became eventually indistinguishable. As a
result, only the younger outer (oblique) faults were observed in this do-
main (compare F5 outer thrust with F3 and F4 in Fig. 9A). The earlier
(inner) thrusts tended to become more parallel to the strike–slip direc-
tion (i.e. they rotated more, e.g. F2 in Fig. 8A2, B and F3 in Fig. 8C) than
those formed later, located more externally and generally displaying
a more oblique direction (sub-perpendicular to the one bisecting the
angle made by basal strike–slip and the velocity discontinuity — e.g.
F5 in Fig. 9A). Along successive cross sections cut progressively closer
to the intersection between the basal strike–slip and the velocity dis-
continuity (Fig. 9A and B — cross sections 3–5), it was possible to ob-
serve the variation of the interference between wrench-related and
thrust-related structures.

In cross section 3 (Fig. 9B), wrench and thrust domains can still be
separately identified. In the wrench domain, deformation bands were
observed to be bounded, on the left, by a rotated segment of an outer
thrust (F5, in Fig. 9A and B), and on the right by a Riedel fault. Both
these structures showed some degree of dip–slip reverse movement,
corresponding to dextral-reverse oblique faults bounding a trans-
pressive pop-up, cut by Y-faults in its middle. The thrust domain along
this same direction also corresponded to a (slightly asymmetric) pop-
up structure, although in this case bounded by faults lacking any kind
of strike–slip component of movement, formed during the first experi-
mental step (faults in yellow in cross section 5 of Fig. 9B): on the left two
forethrusts (F1 and F2), and on the right the original backthrust (BT).

Cross section 4 was cut closer to the intersection between the basal
strike–slip fault and the velocity discontinuity (Fig. 9B — cross section
4). In this cross-section the right-bounding R-fault of the wrench do-
main was no longer observed, and instead the two original left-
bounding faults of the thrust domain (F1 and F2) occurred immediately
to the right of the Y-faults. It should be noted that to the left of these

Y-faults, all the others (F3–F5) also accommodated some amount of
dextral wrenching, consisting in rotated segments of original thrusts
exhibiting oblique (dextral-reverse) kinematics. Conversely, to the right
of the Y-faults, the (F1 and F2) thrusts lacked any kind of wrenching
component.

Cross section 5 was cut through a direction containing the inter-
section between the trace of the basal strike–slip fault and the veloc-
ity discontinuity (Fig. 9B — cross section 5). Along this direction the
separation between thrust and wrench domains was no longer
straightforward. Instead a single interference domain was observed,
comprising both original pure thrusts, formed during the first experi-
mental step (F1, F2 and BT faults in yellow in Fig. 9B — cross section 5),
and dextral strike–slip Y-faults as well as oblique dextral-reverse faults,
formed during experimental step 2 (Y and F3–F5 faults in black in
Fig. 9B — cross section 5). F1 and F2 were positioned to the left of
Y-faults along this same cross-section, with the first steepening at
depth towards the second, thus defining a tulip-like (positive) flower-
structure geometry, consistent with overall (dextral) transpressional
kinematics.

4. Numerical modeling

Taking into account the same general rheological, geometrical and
kinematical constraints described above for the SWIM 1–HTF tectonic
system, wrench–thrust mechanical interference was simulated in a
three-dimensional plate model using the ABAQUS/Standard software
(ABAQUS, Inc. 2009). The main goal was to gain some quantitative in-
sight regarding stress and strain distribution in the thrust–wrench
corner zone, which could not be achieved by analog modeling alone.
In accordance, the present numerical modeling assumed the same
brittle (upper crustal) fault-interference conditions that were consid-
ered for the analog approach. This made it possible to compare both
(analog and numerical) results, and to assess their degree of compat-
ibility, i.e. to evaluate how well (if at all) the previously obtained
structural pattern was matched by the new numerical output, con-
firming or dismissing a mechanical corner effect.

Additionally, the influence of an interbedded shallow soft layer in
the mechanics of the interference at stake, as a possible cause of
decoupled rheological behavior, was also considered. This was motivat-
ed by the known regional seismostratigraphy that includes the Late
Miocene gravitational “chaotic body” unit (see Figs. 4 and 5). As referred
above, this unit was previously interpreted as resulting from a mixture
of olistostromes and tectonic mélanges (Iribarren et al., 2007; Terrinha
et al., 2009; Torelli et al., 1997; Tortella et al., 1997), which could hypo-
thetically determine a relatively less competent rheological behavior.

Since the studied major faults are only seismically imaged down to
maximum depths of ca. 6 to 10 km, the performed numerical model-
ing did not consider their interference at lithospheric scale (accounting
for depths of ca. 40–50 km). Instead, the main objective was to repro-
duce the same specific conditions assumed for the analog experiments,
i.e. to focus on upper crust (brittle) fault-interference. It should be noted
that a numerical modeling approach at lithospheric scale would specif-
ically require the introduction of the ocean–continent transition and
temperature dependent non-linear rheologies (e.g. Neves and Neves,
2009), which considering the main goal referred above was out of
the scope of the present work.

4.1. Model setup

The basic model (MOD1) represents an upper crustal block cover-
ing an area of 480×180 km, with a thickness of 6 km (Fig. 10A and C).
This thickness corresponds to the maximum depth imaged by the
available reflection seismics (e.g. TWTT-depth conversion of IAM?4 line
across the HAP by González et al., 1998; Jimenez-Munt et al., 2010).
The obtained model results were drawn from a central 240×180 km
subarea, to avoid boundary effects. Two planes of weakness, i.e. idealized

faults, account for the Horseshoe thrust and SWIM 1 dextral strike–slip,
dipping 30° and 90°, respectively, and intersecting each other with their
surface traces making an angle of 120°/60° as in the natural example
(see Figs. 2 and 3).

As referred above, the interpretation of the available seismic reflec-
tion dataset also supports the assumption of a ~1.5 km thick layer,
corresponding to the hypothetically less competent Late Miocene “Cha-
otic body” unit (see Figs. 4 and 5), at approximately 1.5 km below the
seafloor. This is simulated in the second set of models (MOD2) by an
interbedded soft layer (Fig. 10D) with its top surface coinciding with
the tip of the strike–slip fault that does not reach the model surface.
This mimics the natural example wherein the SWIM 1 Fault shows little

bathymetric expression (see Figs. 2 and 3), only mildly perturbing the
top Late Miocene to Plio-Quaternary unit in a few locations, despite al-
ways undoubtedly cutting across the underlying Miocene gravitational
“Chaotic body” unit (see Fig. 5).

4.1.1. Rheologic and fault parameters

Although ABAQUS is provided with many material behavior bench-
marks, we needed to conduct a large number of systematic tests to se-
lect the material properties. The most challenging to be constrained
were the material properties of the cohesive elements that constitute
the faults, since they are commonly calibrated for small-scale fractures
found in engineering problems, and not for large-scale geologic faults.

The adopted approach was to iteratively change the parameters until
displacement and stress solutions compatible with the natural esti-
mates and observations were found. The Drucker–Prager plasticity
model was chosen to model the brittle crustal behavior. This was
found to be numerically more stable than the Mohr–Coulomb model,
which failed to converge at an earlier step in the analysis due to larger
deformations. Since we were not interested in examining the details
of the stress distribution within the soft layer, a simple Von-Mises plas-
ticity model was chosen to model the soft layer in MOD2. A Von-Mises
material provides a lower yield stress than the surrounding crustal ma-
terial and simulates a decoupling layer.

The thrust and strike–slip faults are modeled as layers of cohesive
elements. These are specifically designed for bonded interfaces where
the interface thickness is negligibly small compared to other model
dimensions. The constitutive response of the cohesive layer is defined
in terms of an elastic traction versus separation law, i.e. there are three
components of separation, one normal to the interface and two parallel
to it. To prevent faults from opening or closing, the normal component
(E) is much stiffer than the in-plane components (G1 and G2). The

thrust fault cohesive stiffness, G1=G2=30 GPa, is larger than the
strike–slip fault cohesive stiffness, G1=G2=10 GPa, following the
Coulomb–Navier's law of fracture strength. All the material parameters
are listed in Table 2.

4.1.2. Boundary conditions and procedure

The boundary conditions try to match those of the analog model-
ing experiments as closely as possible. Deformation is simulated by
moving basal plate A to the right relatively to plate B (see Fig. 10A).
Because there is some stiffness along the strike–slip fault, plate B is
dragged by plate A towards the thrust fault. The maximum prescribed
displacement along the X direction was 10 km, yielding a maximum
shortening of 2%. Both basal plates are fixed in along the Y direction.
Gravity (g=9.8 m/s2) is applied as a body force. To counterbalance
the weight of the overlying crust a lithostatic pressure is applied at
the bottom of the model. Isostasy is simulated by applying spring
forces at the bottom of the model with stiffness per unit area equal
to (?m??w)g where ?m=3300 kg/m3 is the mantle density and
?w=1000 kg/m3 is the water density.

4.2. Model results

4.2.1. Displacement pattern

Deformation of the basic model (MOD1) is illustrated by vertical
displacement contours on a deformed grid (Fig. 10B), which shows
that the rightwards push of basal plate A was accommodated by move-
ment along both the thrust and strike–slip faults. Flexure of the plate
also occurred in response to the topographical load caused by the
fault offset, in agreement with the flexural theory of faulting (e.g. Bott,
1996). For 2% of shortening the maximum throw along the thrust
fault was 1300 m (Fig. 10B).

4.2.2. Stress and strain distribution

Fig. 11A–C depicts the stress and strain distribution in the obtained
numerical models. The relatively high concentration of stress in the
corner zone of these models (Fig. 11A — MOD1) agrees with the results
obtained in the analog experiments (see above). Likewise, the plot of
principal stresses at model surface shows that the stress directions
clearly rotate near this same corner zone (Fig. 11B — MOD1), and the
maximum compressive stress magnitude increases by a factor of 1/3.
Additionally, the obtained pattern of strain distribution also shows sig-
nificant concentration in the MOD1 corner zone area (Fig. 11C —
MOD1), confirming that this zone is where tectonic structures are pref-
erably expected to develop and concentrate, in line with the predictions
inferred from the analog results.

In contrast, some decrease of the overall state of stress was generally
observed in MOD2 (Fig. 11A — MOD2). Between plates A and B stress
was observed to concentrate at the model surface along a narrow
band coinciding with the direction of the strike–slip fault, although
this was not prescribed to affect the top 1.5 km thick model layer (see
Fig. 10D). In addition, the maximum compressive stress orientation
showed a constant obliquity (45°–50°) relative to the strike–slip direc-
tion, without any significant variations of magnitude or direction in the
corner zone (Fig. 11B — MOD2). Complying with this stress distribution
and with the existence of a shallow soft layer, higher amounts of strain
were observed to diffusely affect the whole of this layer (Fig. 11C —
MOD2), while some degree of strain concentration also occurred
along the trace of the strike–slip fault.

5. Discussion

Both analog and numerical modeling results clearly show the impor-
tance of a corner effect expressed by the deformation pattern that is
expected to develop in a brittle medium due to the mechanical interfer-
ence between a dextral strike–slip fault and a thrust, intersecting each
other at an angle of 120°/60°. Analog modeling provides a characteriza-
tion of the resultant basic structural pattern, revealing its essential
geometry and kinematics. Numerical modeling provides insights on the
way stress and strain are distributed under the same conditions, and
considers the effects of simple rheological variation accounting for a shal-
low interbedded soft layer within the same brittle medium.

5.1. Analog modeling output

The experimentally obtained structural pattern is mostly character-
ized by a concentration in the corner zone of (see Figs. 8 and 9): a)
oblique (dextral-reverse) faults, with different evolving geometries
and associated kinematics; and b) vertical (dextral) strike–slip Y-faults.
While Y-faults tend to generally maintain their main geometry and kine-
matics as strain accumulates in the corner zone, oblique faults do not
since they nucleate as segments of originally pure thrusts that progres-
sively propagate and rotate from the thrust-front to the wrench domain
(see Fig. 8). This propagation-rotation is matched by a corresponding
change in kinematics; from pure (reverse dip–slip) thrusting, to oblique
(transcurrent dominant) dextral-reverse faulting. Early formed faults
undergo a greater amount of more abrupt rotation, with their planes

being more promptly parallelized to the basal strike–slip direction (F2
in Fig. 8A2 and B, and F3 in Fig. 8C). As strain continues to accumulate
in the corner zone, these same planes also become steeper (from an
original dip of ~30°), and eventually subparallel to the Y-faults, prefer-
ably accommodating dextral strike–slip movement (see for instance
in F3 and F4 in cross section 4 of Fig. 9B). Later (outer) faults in the cor-
ner zone endure relatively less displacement, and thus are less rotated
and steepened, striking somewhat subperpendicularly to the bisector
of the angle defined by the thrust-front and the wrenching domains
(see for instance F5 in Fig. 9A and cross section 5).

These results show that in this particular structural setting faults ge-
netically related either to the wrench or to the thrust system do not evo-
lve independently. Active strike–slip faulting in the wrench domain
simultaneously triggers reverse (dip–slip) faulting in the thrust domain,
which subsequently evolves to reverse oblique–slip faulting towards
the corner zone.

5.2. Numerical modeling output

The numerical modeling results also strengthen the working hy-
pothesis of the existence of a thrust–wrench interference corner ef-
fect, in accordance with the structural pattern obtained in the analog
experiments. Stress and strain contours obtained for MOD1 reveal a
consistent concentration of both in the corner zone area (see Fig. 11A
to C — MOD1). This agrees with the high concentration of faults that
characterizes the corner zone in the analog models (see Figs. 8 and 9).
Also, the rotation of the stress field and of the maximum compressive
stress in the MOD1 corner zone (see Fig. 11B — MOD1) agrees with
the described geometry and kinematics of early formed (inner) faults
in the analog models, specifically with their steep planar attitude and
dominant-transcurrent oblique kinematics (see F3 and F4 in Fig. 9A
and cross section 4). In MOD2 strain diffusion in the soft (decoupled)
layer (see Fig. 11C — MOD2) caused a decrease of the overall state of
stress at the model surface, and hindered stress concentration in the
corner zone (Fig. 11A and C — MOD2). The fact that the prescribed
strike–slip fault in MOD2 does not breach out, explains the observed
relative concentration of stress along a narrow band coincident with
the direction of the underlying strike–slip fault (Fig. 11A — MOD2).
This also complies with the observed constant obliquity of the maxi-
mum compressive stress relatively to that same strike–slip direction
(Fig. 11B — MOD2).

5.3. Comparison with the natural example and tectonic implications

The obtained analog modeling results are consistent with the nat-
ural structural pattern revealed by the morphotectonic interpretation
of the HAP corner zone area (Fig. 12). Similarities between model and
natural example are given by the fault pattern, which contains struc-
tures with similar geometries and kinematics. Such model-prototype
congruence shows that the observed natural tectonic pattern is the
result of thrust–wrench interference between the SWIM 1 and Horse-
shoe faults.

The modeled interdependency between both these fault systems,
agrees with a possible multi-rupture scenario involving coeval strike–
slip faulting in the wrenching domain (SWIM system), reverse-faulting
in the thrust domain (Horseshoe system), and sequentially induced
oblique, dextral-reverse faulting in corner zone (SWIM 1–HTF intersec-
tion). Multi-rupture scenarios have been documented in other places
involving dominant transcurrent continental fault-systems, in which
main strike–slip earthquakes trigger thrust-related aftershocks, general-
ly nucleating in restraining bends subsidiary of the main transcurrent
system (e.g. Gobi–Altay Fault and San Andreas Fault, Bayarsayhan et
al., 1996, Kurushin et al., 1997). Although also in continental domains,
wrench–thrust interference faulting is likewise known to be associated
to complex rupture, comprising triggering of thrust faulting only tens
of seconds after strike–slip faulting (e.g. 1976 Tangshan earthquake,

17F.M. Rosas et al. / Tectonophysics 548–549 (2012) 1–21



Butler et al., 1979). In the Gulf of Cadiz, multi-rupture associated to some
kind of interference between different faults (e.g. HTF, MPF and SWIM)
has also been proposed by previous authors (e.g. Gràcia et al., 2003a,b;
Terrinha et al., 2003, 2009; Zitellini et al., 2001). Specifically in the pre-
sent case, and given the dimension of the faults at stake, rupture areas
associated to the corresponding earthquakes could hardly justify the en-
ergy release implied by high magnitude events (M&gt;8.5), such as the
1755 Great Lisbon Earthquake (Gutscher et al., 2009b). Nonetheless,
the potential multi-rupture associated to the study thrust–wrench tec-
tonic interference should be taken into consideration while addressing
seismic hazards for low to moderate magnitude events (Mwb6.0).

In the study area, recent reports on the local seismicity corresponding
to these low to moderate magnitude events (Geissler et al., 2010; Silva
et al., 2010) showed a strong concentration in the SWIM1–HTF corner
zone (see Fig. 6). However, as mentioned above, it is critical to note
that these earthquakes are located at depths mostly comprised between
40 and 55 km, corresponding to the base of the seismogenic layer (with-
in lithospheric mantle), whilst in the available MCS profiles corner faults
are imaged at maximum depths of only ~6–10 km (e.g. CF1 and CF2 in
Fig. 5). While strike–slip faults can easily be extrapolated vertically to
great depths, major lithospheric thrust faults are expected to vary their
dip as a function of depth and correspondent rheology, and thus a non-
negligible horizontal offset between the fault traces and the earthquake
epicenters should be expected. However, in the present case, epicenters
are preferably concentrated merely ~14 and ~25 km to the SE of CF1
and CF2 faults, respectively (see Fig. 6). It is thus difficult to envisage a
direct connection between these faults, imaged at upper crustal depths,
and the reported seismicity originated at lithospheric mantle depths.

It is therefore more likely that the studied thrust–wrench interfer-
ence corner effect recognized in the upper-crust could also exist at
deeper lithospheric levels. According to this idea, a replication of sim-
ilar tectonic interference patterns would occur at different depths, in
different lithospheric layers with similar (competent) bulk rheologies,
as a consequence of similar stress regimes. This is supported by the con-
gruency between the variable orientation of the seismically imaged
faults (at upper crustal depths), and the variation of planes deduced
from focal mechanisms (at mantle lithospheric depths). These focal
mechanisms were reported as somewhat heterogeneous by Geissler et
al. (2010), although mostly compatible with reverse and strike–slip
faulting. This agrees with the modeled thrust–wrench tectonic scenario
as shown by the obtained interference structural pattern in the analog
models, where corner zone faults assume evolving different geometries
and kinematics ranging from pure thrust to pure strike–slip (see Figs. 8
and 9).

Geissler et al. (2010) also proposed a direction of principal stress
components, based on the estimated average stress tensors consistent
with the fault slip orientations from focal mechanisms. Accordingly,
the maximum compressive stress rotates from an approximately E–W
direction, near the northern termination of the HTF (?1 — N103°E/26°
strike/plunge, Fig. 6), to a more N–S direction in the corner zone
(?1 — N351°/12°, Fig. 6), roughly bisecting the angle between the
SWIM 1 and the Horseshoe Thrust Fault. This rotation complies, not
only with the corner zone rotation of the maximum compressive stress
obtained for MOD1 numerical results (see Fig. 11B — MOD1), but also
with the orientation of the characteristic oblique corner faults, observed
both in the analog model and natural structural patterns (see Figs. 8, 9
and 12).

The idea that similar thrust–wrench tectonic interference can ex-
press itself in a decoupled manner at different (crustal and mantle)
lithospheric depths, could explain the recurrently recognized spatial
discrepancy in the Gulf of Cadiz between: (a) the mapped main
tectonic structures, and (b) the dominant low to intermediate “back-
ground” seismicity (Mwb6.0), to which specific major faults are gener-
ally difficult to assign. This agrees with the conspicuous relative absence
of earthquakes at lower crust–upper mantle depths (between ~15 and
40 km, see Fig. 6, Geissler et al., 2010; Silva et al., 2010), which could

also be related to this fault interference pattern. In fact, the WAS data
reported by Sallarès et al. (2011), although based on a profile located fur-
ther to the east (see Fig. 1B), showed the existence of (oceanic) crust
and upper mantle low velocities, which were interpreted by these
authors as the result of alteration and serpentinization caused by fluid
percolation through fault-related rock fractures. The authors specifically
suggest that the SWIM faults, which in their WAS profile are also spatial-
ly coincident with low-marked velocity anomalies, probably play an im-
portant role in this rock alteration process. Thus, in the present study
area, the newly discovered (corner zone) fault interference pattern
could likewise powerfully assist abundant fluid percolation through a
widespread network of fault-related rock fractures, promoting crustal
alteration and mantle serpentinization possibly even in a more efficient
and generalized way. This could explain the reported existence of earth-
quake only at mantle depths of &gt;40 km (and b55 km, Geissler et al.,
2010), where the reach of this softening alteration/serpentinization ef-
fect would tend to be attenuated.

It should be noted that in the Gulf of Cadiz this lower crustal–upper
mantle fluid-related alteration effect, although generally reported as
being associated to tectonic fault channeling, is also thought to be pos-
sible to occur more pervasively, in areas away from the main tectonic
faults. Accordingly, lower upper-mantle velocities were described by
Purdy (1975) and González et al. (1996) in the Horseshoe Abyssal
Plain, similar to velocities reported in the Tagus Abyssal Plain as being
related to mantle serpentinization in the local Ocean–Continental Tran-
sition Zone (Pinheiro et al., 1992).

Another point to consider is the location of the continent–ocean
boundary in the present study area. The implied abrupt thickness and
marked rheological contrast associated to such a boundary would
exert a critical influence on depth nucleation of major tectonic struc-
tures, possibly including the ones associated to both the SWIM and
the HTF systems. Future modeling work should thus consider the pro-
posal of Sallarès et al. (2011) (see Fig. 1B), assuming for the study
area the location of the COB at a distance of ~100 km from the southern
Iberian coast line.

Rheology-controlled decoupling is also illustrated at a different scale
in the upper crust by MOD2 numerical modeling results, which show
that an interbedded soft layer can be responsible for a significant degree
of strain diffusion and delocalization (Fig. 11C — MOD2), hindering the
nucleation and upward propagation of faults, and thus inhibiting the
morphological expression of the fault interference pattern in the corner
zone. This could explain the poor bathymetric expression of the corner
zone structural pattern in the HAP seafloor, caused by a soft-like rheo-
logical behavior of the Late Miocene gravitational “Chaotic Body” unit.

6. Conclusions

The following main conclusions are drawn:

a) The newly discovered tectonic pattern in the area of intersection
(corner zone) between the SWIM 1 and the Horseshoe faults formed
as the result of tectonic interference between active strike–slip and
thrust faulting, respectively.

b) Modeling results show that in the corner zone domain a preferred
concentration of stress and strain occurs (corner effect); the latter
being mainly accommodated by reverse oblique faulting, with
faults exhibiting different evolving geometries and kinematics as
they endure some degree of rotation. A multi-rupture scenario
within the active tectonic framework of the connected SWIM 1
and HTF systems can thus be envisaged, and should be carefully
considered when assessing the seismic-related hazards of low to
moderate seismicity (Mwb6.0) in the Gulf of Cadiz region.

c) In the SWIM 1–HTF corner zone the tectonic pattern is seismically im-
aged at upper crustal depths, whereas the local seismicity is reported
to preferentially occur in the lithospheric mantle (Geissler et al.,
2010). Nonetheless, faults and seismicity data are congruent in a

18 F.M. Rosas et al. / Tectonophysics 548–549 (2012) 1–21



number of aspects (orientation of fault planes and planes deduced
from focal mechanisms, fault kinematics and focal mechanisms,
compatibility with similar stress field orientation). This suggests a
possible occurrence of similar thrust–wrench tectonic interference
at different lithospheric depth-levels with comparable (competent)
rheologies. Accordingly, an intermediate lower crust–upper mantle
aseismic depth domain could be explained by pervasive alteration/
serpentinization, prompted by fluid percolation through fault-
related fractures associated with the newly revealed corner zone
(thrust–wrench) fault-network.

d) Numerical modeling results also illustrate the influence that rheo-
logical stratigraphy might exert on the nucleation and propagation
of the corner zone fault pattern in the upper crust. Specifically, an
interbedded soft layer is shown to inhibit the stress–strain corner
zone concentration in the overlying competent layer. In accordance,
the mild morphological (bathymetric) expression of the corner zone
interference tectonic pattern in the HAP seafloor could eventually be
explained by strain delocalization/diffusion, and consequent lack of
fault propagation, induced by the presence of a rheologically soft
Late Miocene gravitational “Chaotic” unit. Confirmation of such a
possibility should be tested by future work assessing the relationship
between the presence of this seismostratigraphic unit, and the atten-
uation of the bathymetric expression of the (seismically imaged)
tectonic structures at stake. Likewise, future modeling on this issue
should also take into account existent syn- and post-tectonic sedi-
mentation rates, particularly in the HAP where these are expected
to have a crucial influence on preserving/obliterating the bathy-
metric record of active tectonics (Gràcia et al., 2010; Lebreiro et al.,
1997; Zitellini et al., 2009).

Appendix A

Dry quartz sand is classically used to simulate the mechanical be-
havior of upper crustal rocks, since it deforms in a brittle way according
to the Coulomb fracture criterion (e.g. Davis et al., 1983; Hubbert, 1937,
1951):

?ss ¼ ?c?n þ c0 ð1Þ

where ?ss is the shear stress, ?c is the coefficient of internal friction
(?c=tan ?, and ?= internal friction angle), ?n is the normal stress,
and c0 is the cohesion of the material. According to the scale model

theory (Hubbert, 1937), proper scaling is achieved when the ratios ?,
? and ? between model and natural prototype are independently
established for the three fundamental units of length (L), time (T) and
mass (M), respectively:

? ¼
L mð Þ
L pð Þ

; ? ¼
T mð Þ
T pð Þ

; ? ¼
M mð Þ
M pð Þ

ð2Þ

where (m) stands for model and (p) for natural prototype. The Coulomb
fracture criterion governs time independent deformation of brittle ma-
terials, since yield stress is insensitive to the rate of deformation provid-
ed that the inertial forces are negligible, as in the present case. Thus, ?
ratio is redundant for the present scaling. Length ratio (?) was chosen
given the dimensions of the employed deformation apparatus (see
Section 3.1.2 and Fig. 7A) as ?=5×10?6. Of the two relevant material
properties, coefficient of internal friction (?c) and cohesion (c0), the first
is dimensionless, and approximately the same in both model and proto-
type (see Table 1), whereas the second has dimension of stress and thus
must be scaled accordingly (Hubbert, 1937):

? ¼
c0 mð Þ
c0 pð Þ

¼
??

?2
ð3Þ

where ? and ? are the model/prototype ratio for stress and for acceler-
ation respectively. Since inertial forces are negligible when compared
with gravity,

? ¼ ?g ¼
g mð Þ
g pð Þ

¼
?

?2
¼ 1 ð4Þ

where ?g is the model/prototype gravity acceleration ratio. Thus,
substituting ?=1in Eq. (3) allows the following simplification:

? ¼
c0 mð Þ
c0 pð Þ

¼
?

?2
¼

??

?3
¼ ?? ð5Þ

where ? corresponds to the model/prototype density ratio. Substituting
? and ? in Eq. (5) by the respective values of Table 1, immediately allows
the determination of the implied mass ratio ?=6.25×10?17.

In the Gulf of Cadiz key segment of the Africa–Iberia plate boundary (North-East Atlantic ocean), three main

different modes of tectonic interference between a recently identified wrench system (SWIM) and the Gulf of

Cadiz Accretionary Wedge (GCAW) were tested through analog sand-box modeling: a) An active accretion-

ary wedge on top of a pre-existent inactive basement fault; b) An active strike-slip fault cutting a previously

formed, inactive, accretionary wedge; and c) Simultaneous activity of both the accretionary wedge and the

strike-slip fault. The results we obtained and the comparison with the natural deformation pattern favor a

tectonic evolution comprising two main steps: i) the formation of the Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge on

top of inactive, Tethyan-related, basement faults (Middle Miocene to ~1.8 Ma); ii) subsequent reactivation

of these basement faults with dextral strike-slip motion (~1.8 Ma to present) simultaneously with continued

tectonic accretion in the GCAW. These results exclude the possibility of ongoing active SWIM wrench system

cross-cutting an inactive GCAW structure. Our results also support a new interpretation of the SWIM wrench

system as fundamentally resulting from strike-slip reactivation of an old (Tethyan-related) plate boundary.

1. Introduction

The Gulf of Cadiz is situated in the North-East Atlantic Ocean, west
of the Gibraltar Straits, offshore SW Iberia and NW Morocco (Fig. 1).
This zone marks the transition between the Mediterranean Alpine
Collision Belt and the Atlantic Azores–Gibraltar Fracture Zone
(AGFZ; see Fig. 1) and corresponds to a segment of the Africa–Eurasia
plate boundary previously described as tectonically diffuse (e.g.
Sartori et al., 1994; Medialdea et al., 2004). Accordingly, a variety of
tectonic structures with different orientations, corresponding mostly
to W–NW directed thrusts and WNW–ESE dextral strike-slip faults
(Fig. 1B), are thought to accommodate a WNW–ESE present conver-
gence between Eurasia (Iberia sub-plate) and Africa (Nubia sub-
plate) at a rate of ca. 4–5 mm/year (Argus et al., 1989; DeMets et al.,
1994; Sella et al., 2002; Calais et al., 2003; Fernandes et al., 2003;
Fernandes, 2004; Nocquet and Calais, 2004; Fernandes et al., 2007).

The seismicity of this domain has been characterized as moderate,
although several high magnitude historical and instrumental earth-
quakes are known (e.g. Ms=7.9 28/02/1969 and Mw=6.0, 12/02/
2007 earthquakes respectively, Fukao, 1973 and Stich et al., 2006,
2007). Among these, the 1755 Great Lisbon Earthquake (estimated
magnitude of 8.5 to 8.7; Abe, 1979; Johnston, 1996; Martinez-
Solares and López Arroyo, 2004) triggered a devastating tsunami
and destroyed the Portuguese capital (Baptista et al., 1998; Zitellini
et al., 2001; Martinez-Solares and López Arroyo, 2004). Despite recent
mapping updates of the main tectonic structures of this region based
on the interpretation of a great variety of newly acquired data (e.g.
multi-beam swath bathymetry, reflection and refraction seismics,
geodetic; Johnston, 1996; González et al., 1996; Zitellini et al., 2001;
Gutscher et al., 2002, 2009a,b; Baptista et al., 2003; Gràcia et al.,
2003a,b; Mulder et al., 2003; Zitellini et al., 2004; Rosas et al., 2009;
Terrinha et al., 2009; Zitellini et al., 2009), the precise location of
the seismogenic/tsunamigenic source of 1755 major event is still
the subject of ongoing debate (e.g. Baptista et al., 1998; Buforn et
al., 1988; Zitellini et al., 2001; Gràcia et al., 2003a,b; Terrinha et al.,
2003; Gutscher, 2004; Gutscher, 2006; Terrinha et al., 2009).

In the tectonic map of Fig. 1B three main sets of structures are im-
mediately recognized: a) several NE–SW striking, westward directed

faults), successively considered and dismissed as possible seismo-
genic/tsunamigenic sources of the 1755 Great Lisbon Earthquake
(e.g. Buforn et al., 1988; Baptista et al., 1998; Zitellini et al., 2001;
Terrinha et al., 2009). The other two sets of tectonic structures sup-
port the following two fundamental ideas for the interpretation of
the Gulf of Cadiz tectonic framework (Gutscher et al., 2002; Zitellini
et al., 2009):

- Gutscher et al. (2002), building on previously reported similar
ideas (e.g. Royden, 1993 and Lonergan and White, 1997), consid-
ered the tectonic evolution of this plate boundary as being domi-
nated by active (roll back) subduction of a retreating east-dipping
lithospheric slab, presently positioned beneath the Gibraltar Arc
(Fig. 1B). Accordingly, associated synthetic accretion of sedi-
ments is also reported to occur, represented by the Gulf of Cadiz
Accretionary Wedge (GCAW, Fig. 1B), in which several
imbricated west-directed active thrusts accommodate on-going
shortening.

- Zitellini et al. (2009) argued for the existence of a broad transpres-
sive deformation band, comprising a set of WNW–ESE striking,
subvertical, dextral strike-slip faults (SWIM faults in Fig. 1B),
which as a whole extend for more than 600 km, from the eastern
part of the Gulf of Cadiz to the southern limit of the Gorringe bank.
These faults are interpreted by the cited authors as lithospheric
faults, and in view of that the SWIM fault system was proposed
to mark a newly formed plate boundary connecting the AGFZ to
the Rif Mountain belt in northern Morocco.

It should be noted that Zitellini et al. (2009) considered the dex-
tral transcurrent SWIM faults in the Gulf of Cadiz as presently active,
and cutting the GCAW thrusts, whose activity is considered to be neg-
ligible since late Miocene times. Conversely, Gutscher et al. (2002)
considered the GCAW thrusts as still active, and as referred above re-
lated with present on-going subduction beneath the Gibraltar arc.

In the present work, we test the above assumptions using analog
modeling sand-box experiments to model the interference between
the two major tectonic systems in the Gulf of Cadiz, i.e. SWIM dextral
wrenching and GCAW thrusting, assuming three main different
possibilities:

1) The GCAW is presently active and the SWIM faults are thought to
correspond to inactive basement faults, inherited from a previous
tectonic evolution;

2) The SWIM faults are thought to correspond to major, presently ac-
tive, dextral strike-slips, cutting a previously formed inactive
GCAW;

3) Both tectonic systems are presently active.

Thorough comparison of the obtained results with the observed
natural morphotectonic pattern is carried out for each of the above
cases. Accordingly, resulting tectonic implications for the local and
whole scale evolution of this segment of the Eurasia–Africa plate
boundary are evaluated and explored.

2. Morphotectonic characterization of the study area

The morphology of the Gulf of Cadiz is largely controlled by the
main tectonic processes in the area: the thrusting accommodating
the GCAW accretion and the wrenching associated to the SWIM
fault system. The high-resolution bathymetry of the GCAW shows a
west dipping U-shaped body (Figs. 1B and 2A) that extends for
more than 250 km from about longitude 7°W to 9°30?W, with depths
ranging from 200 to 4300 m. It narrows slightly to the west with a
width varying from 160 to 140 km (see Figs. 1B and 2A). Its wrinkled
surface morphology is shaped not only by thrust-related slope breaks
and associated folds, which define a large scale stepping morphology,

but is also the result of the different combined manifestations of grav-
itational and fluid escape processes (e.g. “raft-tectonics” type fea-
tures, sub-circular collapse depressions, mud volcanoes, salt diapirs;
Mulder et al., 2003; Pinheiro et al., 2003; Gutscher et al., 2009b;
Terrinha et al., 2009; Zitellini et al., 2009). From a structural point of
view, the accretionary wedge corresponds to an eastward thickening
pile of westward thrust sediments (Fig. 2B and C), reaching a maxi-
mum thickness of ca. 15 km near the Gibraltar Straits (Thiebot and
Gutscher, 2006; Gutscher et al., 2009a). The thrusts root in a common
sub-horizontal to gently east dipping decollement layer, exhibiting an
overall geometry complying with on-going eastward subduction be-
neath the Gibraltar Arc (Gutscher et al., 2002). During the last 5 Ma,
the E–W convergence rate implied in such a subduction is thought
to have diminished from ca. 2 cm/year to 0.5 cm/year (Gutscher et
al., 2009a), with a consequent decrease in the activity of the wedge
thrusts during this time span. Accordingly, the same authors argue
that the present internal deformation is preferentially accommodated
by small increments of local reactivation of inherited blind thrusts,
being more homogeneously distributed over the entire wedge, rather
than concentrated on newly formed major frontal thrusts.

The morphologic expression of the SWIM faults corresponds to a
continuous alignment of seafloor crests and troughs, sometimes exhi-
biting an en-échelon geometrical disposition, and commonly punctu-
ated by active mud volcanoes within the domain of the accretionary
wedge (see Fig. 1B; Duarte et al., 2009; Terrinha et al., 2009; Zitellini
et al., 2009). This overall linear morphology is more prominent both
close to the northern part of the GCAW front and in the Horseshoe
Valley, where lineaments can be followed almost continuously for
more than 200 km (e.g. SWIM 1 in Figs. 1B and 3A). The available re-
flection seismic dataset in the study area shows that SWIM faults cor-
respond to aligned arrays of deep-rooted faults, often breaching out
through the present seafloor sediments and showing extensive evi-
dence for associated fluid migration (e.g. seismic blanking along
fluid extrusion paths in Fig. 3B and C; Rosas et al., 2009; Terrinha et
al., 2009). From the inspection of the IAM 4 and 3 seismic profiles in
Fig. 3, it is apparent that the SWIM faults are aligned along basement
pre-existent (Mesozoic) faults (dashed black lines in Fig. 3; see also
Duarte et al., 2009 and Terrinha et al., 2009). Analog modeling of
sets of en-échelon folds formed in soft-cover sediments overlying
some of the SWIM basement dextral strike-slips (Rosas et al., 2009)
yielded an age for their activity of ca. 1.8 Ma.

2.1. The SWIM–GCAW interference area

The critical area to understand the interference between the
SWIM strike-slips and the GCAW is close to its deformation front
(Fig. 4A). Along this front, from north to south, three interference
sub-areas were thoroughly analyzed (B to D in Fig. 4). The SWIM 2
fault intersects a northern segment of the GCAW front (Fig. 4B) in
the vicinity of the Sagres Valley, at an angle of about 40°. Within the
thrust wedge to the east, the morphological expression of the SWIM
2 is well marked by a slightly arched trough that splays in the same
direction. Conversely, in the Sagres Valley it is almost indiscernible
due to the widespread presence of scours and slumps, and it is only
detectable by the presence of a gentle slope break. In this area no off-
set of the wedge deformation front is observed, instead only a small
wrinkled WNW–ESE elongate bulge can be detected in the bathyme-
try of the frontal GCAW (see Fig. 4B). The SWIM 1 fault exhibits a
clear morphological expression in the Horseshoe Valley, intersecting
the wedge deformation front just to the north of the Coral Patch
Ridge, at an angle of about 70° (Fig. 4C). Its continuation to the east
is less visible, although punctuated by mud volcanoes. Similarly to
what was described for the SWIM 2 fault, there is no bathymetric
evidence for the offset of the wedge front by the SWIM 1 fault. The
SWIM 3 fault cuts along the southern flank of the Coral Patch Ridge
with a strong morphological imprint (Fig. 4D), corresponding to a

137J.C. Duarte et al. / Marine Geology 289 (2011) 135–149



lineament marked by several elongated WNW–ESE ridges, troughs
and slope breaks. To the east, this lineament crosses a small portion
of the Seine Abyssal Plain and intersects the accretionary wedge
deformation front, at an angle of about 80°. In this location the
wedge front is marked by a slight embayment. On the wedge surface
to the north of the fault and parallel to it, an elongated protuberance
is also unmistakably observed, limited by two descending slope
breaks and vanishing progressively toward the east. As in the two
cases described above, the observed morphology does not account
for any kind of fault offset overprint relationships.

3. Analog modeling

Our objective is to test several simple chronological possibilities
of mechanical interference between a strike-slip fault and a thrust
wedge front, under model conditions comparable to the ones govern-
ing the SWIM–GCAW tectonic interference. Three main experiments
were carried out to investigate the different deformation patterns
resulting from: a) A thrust wedge developed on top of an inactive
basement (strike-slip) fault; b) An active dextral strike-slip fault af-
fecting an inactive thrust wedge; c) The simultaneous alternate activ-
ity of a thrust wedge front and a dextral strike-slip fault. Experiments
were performed to respect the general, simplified, geometry, kine-
matics and rheology ascribed to the natural strike-slip (SWIM) sys-
tem and to the (GCAW) thrust wedge. However, analog modeling
with dry granular materials cannot reproduce all the complex

processes (e.g. fluid overpressure and expulsion, sedimentary deposi-
tion, and local gravitational instabilities) which occur in submarine
environments. Nevertheless, the regional kinematic and relative tim-
ing caused by the local tectonic driving forces and the ensuing struc-
tural evolution can be well investigated.

3.1. Experimental method

3.1.1. Material properties and scaling

The material used as an analog of the GCAW sedimentary rocks
was dry quartz sand, whose properties are summarized in Table 1.
Sand is considered a Coulomb material deforming in a brittle way
according to the Coulomb fracture criterion (e.g. Hubbert, 1937,
1951; Davis et al., 1983, Appendix A), and it has been extensively
used in scaled model experiments simulating similar brittle deforma-
tion in the upper crust (e.g. Mandl et al., 1977; Mulugeta, 1988; Casas
et al., 2001; Marques and Cobbold, 2002).

The present models were properly scaled according to the scale
model theory of Hubbert (1937). The assumed model — prototype
ratios are presented in Table 1, and the detailed procedure of scaling
is specified in Appendix A.

3.1.2. Apparatus and initial stage

Experiments were done using a rectangular 100 cm×60 cm
Perspex deformation rig, comprising two laterally juxtaposed basal
plates and a moving backstop (Fig. 5A). In the initial stage of the

experiments, 1 cm thick layered sand cake was built on top of the
basal rigid plates by pouring batches of differently colored sand
from a moving elongated funnel, guaranteeing the leveling of its top
surface. The basal plates in the model move laterally relatively to
each other, and account for the natural basement beneath the thrust
wedge decollement (see Fig. 2C). The vertical contact plane between
these plates complies with the dominant WNW–ESE orientation of
the SWIM 1 fault system (see Figs. 1 and 4). The model sand cake cor-
responds to the overlying cover sediments, in which accretion is sim-
ulated by pushing against it a backstop that slides on top of both basal
plates. The backstop lacks any kind of correspondence with any natu-
ral feature, and was exclusively used to produce a classical model
thrust wedge. Likewise the (~0.2 cm thick) layering in the sand cake
has also no correspondence with any natural structures, and was
used merely as a 3D passive strain marker. In all experiments the di-
mensions of the deformation rig were sufficiently large to guarantee
that the bulk of the model was not affected by boundary conditions.
The experiments were repeated several times to ensure the reproduc-
ibility of the obtained results. Top view photographs were taken at
regular time intervals. The final stage of the model was humidified
and serially sectioned for three-dimensional analysis.

3.1.3. Procedure

Three main experiments were carried out to study three basic pos-
sibilities of mechanical interference between a strike-slip basement
fault and a thrust wedge:

1) Active thrust wedge and inactive basement fault: the backstop
was initially pushed against the sand-cake, on top of the two
immobile basal plates.

2) Active basement fault and inactive thrust wedge: after a thrust
wedge was previously formed in the sand, the basal plates were
dextrally moved relatively to each other.

3) Active basement fault and active thrust wedge: the reactivation of
a previously formed thrust wedge was successively alternated
with the right-lateral movement between the basal plates.

3.2. Experimental results

3.2.1. Experiment 1: active thrust wedge and inactive basement fault

Up until ~30% of shortening a thrust wedge was classically obtained,
through the forward propagation of regularly spaced thrusts, as a result
of moving the backstop to the left (see Figs. 5B and 6A). For a shortening
of 31% (Fig. 6A) the front of the accretionary wedge developed an em-
bayment coinciding with the direction of the inactive basement fault
(yellow dashed line in Fig. 6A). For a shortening of 38% a new thrust
(n+1 in Fig. 6B) was formed exclusively to the north of that basement
discontinuity. Only when the shortening reached 39%, did the equiva-
lent new thrust form to the south, resulting in a misleading left-lateral
offset geometry (yellow arrows in Fig. 6C), in spite of the total absence
of relative movement between the two basal rigid plates. For a shorten-
ing of 48% this false offset in front of the newer thrust disappeared
(Fig. 6D). In the wedge lower area a linear southeastward splaying,
slightly anastomosing, deformation pattern (white lines in Fig. 6D)
was progressively developed as shortening accumulated and new out-
ward thrusts successively formed.

3.2.2. Experiment 2: active basement fault and inactive thrust wedge

After 48% of shortening the basement strike-slip fault was activat-
ed with dextral movement (Fig. 7) When the horizontal displacement
between the basal plates reached only 0.2 cm, a thin elongated bulge
formed coinciding with the basement strike-slip direction (Fig. 7A).
At this stage no offset of the thrust wedge was observed. A further
right-lateral displacement of 0.6 cm between the basal plates clearly
offset the thrust wedge, preferably affecting its frontal outer thrust
(Fig. 7B). For a displacement of 1.3 cm the strike-slip fault seemingly
propagated inward, but only across the following three thrusts
(Fig. 7C–D). The resultant model deformation pattern always showed
the preferential offset of the frontal thin part of the accretionary
wedge, relative to its innermost domains that remained unaffected.

3.2.3. Experiment 3: active basement fault and active thrust wedge

After the formation of a thrust wedge due to 47% of shortening, a
right-lateral displacement of 1 cm was applied to the basal plates
(Fig. 8A). As a result, a linear bulge formed in the sand foreland,

along the strike-slip direction, cutting across the thrust wedge and
offsetting its front. Similarly to experiment 2, the amount of right-
lateral displacement diminished toward the thicker inner part of the
wedge. Subsequently, another 0.4% of incremental shortening was
applied to the model (Fig. 8B). As a result, a new frontal thrust
formed, but only to the north of the strike-slip fault. The resultant
geometry mimics a false left-lateral offset of the outer frontal thrust
(apparent as n+1 in Fig. 8B), although careful consideration of the
propagation chronology of the thrusts revealed a true dextral offset
(affecting thrust n in Fig. 8B), complying with the underlying base-
ment fault kinematics. Further 1% of applied shortening (Fig. 8C) pro-
duced the new thrust (n+1) also to the south of the strike-slip fault,
erasing the previously formed false offset. Another 3.5 cm of dextral
strike-slip displacement was additionally applied to the basal plates
(Fig. 8D), and as a consequence, the wedge front was once more kine-
matically truly dextrally offset. Riedel faults formed on the wedge
surface displaying a clear en-échelon spatial disposition, and interfer-
ing with the preexistent stepping morphology associated with the
thrust stacking. Finally, after another 2.6% of shortening (Fig. 9),
reaching a total accumulated amount of 51%, the frontal wedge offset
was once again almost completely attenuated, although the total
accumulated basal strike-slip displacement was of 4.5 cm (corre-
sponding to 22.5 km). It should be noted that the previously formed
linear en-échelon pattern was preserved in the wedge surface, includ-
ing in its innermost domain.

4. Discussion

Experiment 1 shows that an active thrust wedge forming in cover
sediments above an inactive basement fault records the resultant me-
chanical interference in the form of a linear, inner splaying, perturba-
tion of the wedge morphological surface (white lines in Fig. 6C–D).
This formed as the result of the successive thrust propagation across
the basement anisotropy, which behaved as a mechanical obstacle
for the lateral propagation of the frontal thrust. Since this basement
anisotropy remains stationary relatively to an external reference
frame, and the thrust front propagates forward (to the left), the resul-
tant interference area between both these features migrates from the
lower periphery of the thrust front to its central domain (compare the
position of the linear perturbation pattern in Fig. 6A to D). Compari-
son with the natural example shows that the observed inner splaying

lineaments in the GCAW (see SWIM 1 in Fig. 1B and SWIM 2 in
Fig. 4B), could have originated simply as a consequence of preexisting
inactive basement faults. This agrees with the fact that these linea-
ments are observed in the inner thicker part of the natural thrust
wedge, in the complete absence of offset of its thinner frontal part.

Experiment 2 shows that an active basement strike-slip fault
affecting an overlying preexistent thrust-wedge, must produce a
clear offset of its thinner front, even for minor increments of strike-
slip basal displacement (1.3 cm corresponding to 6.5 km). This offset
vanishes rapidly toward the inner thicker parts of the wedge, affect-
ing almost exclusively the outer frontal thrusts. Comparison with
the natural example shows that if the GCAW is presently inactive,
and cut by active dextral strike-slip (SWIM) faults, then unambiguous
offset of the GCAW front has to exist, which is clearly not the case (see
Figs. 1B, 2 and 4).

Experiment 3 shows that if both the basal strike-slip fault and the
thrust wedge are active, with alternating incremental fault slips, then
the resultant interference deformation pattern can be the cyclic repe-
tition of the following three possibilities: a) true right-lateral offset of
the thrust wedge front (see Fig. 8A and D); b) false left-lateral offset
of the thrust wedge front (see Fig. 8B, similar to experiment 1 see
Fig. 6C); c) no offset of the thrust wedge front (see Figs. 8C and 9).
It should be noted that the absence of thrust wedge offset does not
imply an absence of basement strike-slip displacement, which quite
on the contrary is continually increasing. However, the alternation
with the incremental shortening that drives the successive forward
thrust propagation cyclically erases the offset of the frontal thrust
wedge. Differently, the resultant linear en-échelon interference pat-
tern tends to be increasingly well marked, including in the innermost
domains of the thrust wedge (compare the lineament in the Figs. 8A
and 9). Similarly to experiment 1, the intermediate experimental
stage in which a false left-lateral offset originates (see Fig. 8B), is
here interpreted as the result of a delayed propagation of the newer
outer thrust across the strike-slip fault, which in accordance seeming-
ly behaves as a mechanical obstacle to such propagation.

In view of these results, and considering the fact that in the natural
example the GCAW front is not offset across any of the mapped
SWIM faults, one of the two following tectonic scenarios is possible:
a) either the GCAW is active, and forming over a basement anisotropy
(inactive SWIM fault?); or b) both the GCAW and the SWIM faults are
active. The possibility of an inactive GCAW being cut by active dextral

strike-slip SWIM faults is clearly ruled out by the present experimen-
tal results.

4.1. Tectonic implications

The west Mediterranean tectonic evolution comprised the Meso-
zoic opening of the Tethys Ocean (Fig. 10A; e.g. Maldonado et al.,
1999; Gutscher et al., 2002; Stampfli et al., 2002; Gràcia et al.,
2003a; Jiménez-Munt et al., 2010). This would account for a base-
ment tectonic anisotropy, hypothetically, either consisting in previ-
ous transform faults, or in rift-related normal faults (Fig. 10A and
B). In view of the presented experimental results, the accretionary
wedge (GCAW) is here interpreted to have formed on top of such
basement faults (present day SWIM faults) as a consequence of roll-
back subduction beneath Gibraltar. During this period (Middle Mio-
cene to ~1.8 Ma?, Fig. 10C to E) these faults were probably inactive,
although capable of originating a linear-like perturbation in the
GCAW surface morphology (experiment 1). At the same time, the
main regional convergence direction between Iberia and Africa grad-
ually suffered a counterclockwise rotation, shifting from N–S
(Fig. 10B) to near WNW–ESE (Fig. 10E). Such reorientation is inter-
preted to have triggered (since at least ~1.8 Ma) a dextral strike-slip
reactivation of the basement (SWIM) faults (Fig. 10F), during a period
in which the subduction driving the GCAW growth was still active
(experiment 3), although slowing down (Gutscher et al., 2009a). It
should be noted that this rotation of the main convergence direction
also agrees with the general strain partitioning tectonic scenario pre-
viously proposed by Terrinha et al. (2009), according to which be-
sides dextral strike slip faulting along near E–W orientated faults,
northwest directed thrusts also occur along NE–SW orientated tec-
tonic structures (e.g. Horseshoe, Marquês de Pombal and Gorringe
Faults in Fig. 1B).

Other indirect evidence supporting present simultaneous activity
of SWIM and GCAW includes the fact that not only all known mud
volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz are located on top of the accretionary
wedge, but also the circumstance that most of the deep mud volca-
noes are symptomatically aligned and coincident with the SWIM
faults (Fig. 1A). This suggests that the fluid migration and escape
may be simultaneously controlled by the activity of both structures.
If that is in fact the case, then the mud volcanoes could be preferen-
tially located at the intersection between the SWIM strike-slip and
the GCAW thrust faults, with such loci providing good pathways for
the fluid to ascend (Pinheiro et al., 2003, 2005; Duarte et al., 2005;
Rosas et al., 2009; Terrinha et al., 2009; Zitellini et al., 2009).

5. Conclusions

1. In view of the presented experimental results, the observed mor-
photectonic pattern of the frontal GCAW area is compatible with:
i) The development of the GCAW on top of inactive, previously

formed, basement faults (present day SWIM fault system).
ii) The simultaneously (alternating) activity of the GCAW thrust-

ing with the activity of the SWIM-related dextral strike-slip
faults.

Conversely, the comparison of the same experimental results with
the natural example unambiguously excludes the possibility of active
strike-slip faulting (SWIM system) affecting an inactive preexistent
GCAW, implying that if the SWIM fault system is active then the
GCAW must also be presently active.

2. The main tectonic implications of the above conclusions comprise
an initial (Middle Miocene to ~1.8 Ma) accretion of the GCAW
sediments on top of preexistent Tethyan rift-related faults,
preceding strike-slip reactivation of these faults (SWIM system),
simultaneously with decreasing GCAW activity (~1.8 Ma to pre-
sent), as a function of counterclockwise rotation of the main
Iberia–Nubia convergence direction.

3. The modeling and morphological observations favor the interpre-
tation of the SWIM fault system as the strike-slip reactivation of
pre-existent basement faults. This suggests that the SWIM plate
boundary proposed by Zitellini et al. (2009) may in fact correspond
to the local reactivation of the older Tethyan plate boundary.

Appendix A

The material used as an analog of the upper crust sedimentary
rocks was dry quartz sand, which is considered a Coulomb material
deforming in a brittle way according to the Coulomb fracture criterion
(e.g. Hubbert, 1937, 1951; Davis et al., 1983):

?ss ¼ ?c?n þ c0 ð1Þ

where ?ss is the shear stress, ?c is the coefficient of internal friction
(?c=tan ?, and ? = internal friction angle), ?n is the normal stress,
and c0 is the cohesion of the material. According to the scale
model theory (Hubbert, 1937), proper scaling is achieved when the
ratios between model and natural prototype are independently estab-
lished for the three fundamental units of length (?), time (?) and
mass (?):

? ¼
L mð Þ
L pð Þ

;? ¼
T mð Þ
T pð Þ

; ? ¼
M mð Þ
M pð Þ

ð2Þ

where L=length, T=time and M=mass, and (m) stands for model
and (p) for natural prototype. The Coulomb fracture criterion governs

time independent deformation of brittle materials like sedimentary
upper crustal rocks, since yield stress is insensitive to the rate of
deformation provided that the inertial forces are negligible, as in the
present case. This means that ? ratio is not needed for scaling in this
situation. Length ratio (?) was chosen given the maximum dimen-
sions of the deformation apparatus used in the experiments (see
Section 3), and was conveniently established as ?=2×10?6. In the
present case, of the two relevant material properties, coefficient of
internal friction (?c) and cohesion (c0), the first is dimensionless,
and approximately the same in both model and prototype, whereas
the second has dimension of stress and thus must be scaled accord-
ingly (Hubbert, 1937):

? ¼
c0 mð Þ
c0 pð Þ

¼
??

?2
ð3Þ

where ? and ? are the model/prototype ratio for stress and for accel-
eration respectively. Since inertial forces are negligible when com-
pared with gravity,

? ¼ ?g ¼
g mð Þ
g pð Þ

¼
?

?2
¼ 1 ð4Þ

where ?g is the model/prototype gravity acceleration ratio. Thus,
substituting ?=1 in Eq. (3) allows the following simplification:

? ¼
c0 mð Þ
c0 pð Þ

¼
?

?2
¼

??

?3
¼ ?? ð5Þ

where ? corresponds to the model/prototype density ratio. Substitut-
ing ? and ? in Eq. (5) by the respective values in Table 1, immediately
allows the determination of the implied mass ratio=4×10?18. It
should also be noted that since ? is generally close to one (between
0.5 and 0.7, e.g. Withjack et al., 2007) the strength of the materials
expressed by ? is scaled with the length (?). Given the fact that in
the present case ?=2×10?6 and since cohesion for upper crustal
rocks is clearly typically less than 50 MPa, it becomes immediately ev-
ident the utility of model materials with very low cohesion (b100 Pa),
such as dry quartz sand, as analogs of upper crustal rocks.
