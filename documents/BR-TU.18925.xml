Abstract 
Mannosylglycerate (MG) is an osmolyte widespread in microorganisms adapted to hot 

environments. The effect of MG on the protection of model proteins against 

heat-induced denaturation and aggregation has been amply demonstrated in vitro. 

These characteristics make MG a valuable compound in biotechnological applications. 

However, the practical application of MG is hampered by the high production cost.  

In this work, we engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the production of MG. Two 

strains (VSY71 and CEN.PK2) and several carbon sources were examined to optimize 

the production of MG. Using glucose as carbon source, the strain VSY71 accumulated 

90 µmol MG/g of dry mass, an increase of 2-fold compared with strain CEN.PK2. The 

effect of several carbon sources (sucrose, mannose, galactose and raffinose) on MG 

production by strain VSY71 was also investigated. Synthesis of MG (28.1 µmol/g of dry 

mass) was detected with sucrose only. In addition to the biotechnological importance of 

being a MG producer, this strain can serve as a platform to assess protein stabilization 

by osmolytes in vivo. Therefore, we used it to evaluate the effect of MG on the 

aggregating-prone protein, ?-synuclein (?-Syn). For that, the S. cerevisiae strain 

VSY72, harboring two copies of ?-Syn-EGFP integrated in the genome, was 

engineered to synthesize MG. As a control, a mutant transformed with the empty 

MG-plasmid was also constructed. The accumulation of MG (20 µmol/g of dry mass) 

prior to ?-Syn over-production clearly reduced the formation of inclusions of this 

protein; moreover, the formation of reactive oxygen species induced by ?-Syn over-

production decreased in the MG-producing strain. Additionally, when MG accumulation 

was induced in cells harboring large inclusions of ?-Syn there was an effective 

solubilization of these forms. This work clearly shows that MG inhibits the aggregation 

of ?-Syn and promotes the solubilization of ?-Syn inclusions in vivo.

Resumo  
 
Microrganismos adaptados a proliferar optimamente em ambientes com temperatura 

elevada são designados termófilos ou hipertermófilos, consoante a temperatura óptima 

de crescimento se situa entre 60ºC e 80ºC ou acima de 80ºC, respectivamente. Estes 

organismos têm sido isolados a partir de amostras de zonas geotermais, quer 

terrestres quer marinhas, superficiais ou de profundidade, bem como de ambientes 

aquecidos artificialmente. 

Tal como a maioria dos microrganismos halofílicos ou halotolerantes, os 

microrganismos termofílicos e hipertermofílicos provenientes de ambientes marinhos 

acumulam compostos orgânicos denominados “solutos compatíveis” para 

contrabalançar a pressão osmótica exterior. São moléculas de baixa massa molecular, 

com elevada solubilidade em água e que podem atingir concentrações elevadas no 

interior das células (da ordem de 1 M) sem interferirem negativamente com as funções 

celulares. Para além da sua função na adaptação a flutuações na osmolaridade do 

meio exterior, alguns destes solutos são preferencialmente acumulados em resposta a 

temperaturas supra-óptimas. Além disso, os solutos típicos de (hiper)termófilos são 

quimicamente diferentes dos que geralmente são encontrados em organismos 

mesofílicos, nomeadamente no que se refere à carga eléctrica da molécula que é 

negativa nos primeiros e neutra nos segundos. Este conjunto de observações levou à 

hipótese de que os solutos compatíveis de (hiper)termófilos desempenhariam um 

papel relevante na protecção de componentes celulares contra os efeitos 

desnaturantes provocados por temperaturas elevadas. 

Manosilglicerato é um dos solutos compatíveis mais frequentemente encontrado em 

microrganismos adaptados a ambientes quentes. Foi identificado inicialmente em 

Rhodothermus marinus, uma bactéria termofílica isolada de uma nascente geotermal 

dos Açores, mas posteriormente foi detectado em muitos outros (hiper)termófilos 

(trabalho da nossa equipa). A maioria dos organismos estudados acumula este soluto 

em resposta a stress osmótico, no entanto acumulação em resposta a stress térmico 

tem sido observada em alguns casos. Ensaios in vitro com proteínas modelo 

mostraram que manosilglicerato actua como estabilizador, exibindo capacidade 

termoprotectora muito superior à da trealose, um soluto característico de organismos 



 
iv 

mesofilos. Manosilglicerato tem-se revelado um excelente protector da estrutura de 

proteínas, impedindo a sua desnaturação e subsequente agregação, bem como a 

perda de actividade no caso de enzimas. Por estas razões, o manosilglicerato tem 

grande potencialidade de aplicação, nomeadamente na indústria cosmética, como 

hidratante e protector solar, na conservação de vacinas durante armazenamento e 

transporte, como estabilizador de enzimas em “kits” clínicos e analíticos e na 

estabilização de proteínas usadas em biosensores. Em particular, manosilglicerato 

aumenta o tempo de vida de vectores retrovirais e melhora a sensibilidade em 

metodologias com microgrelhas de DNA. Trata-se portanto de um composto valioso 

sob o ponto de vista biotecnológico. Contudo, a produção de manosilglicerato é 

actualmente um processo altamente dispendioso, uma vez que o seu isolamento é 

realizado a partir da biomassa de um produtor natural, Rhodothermus marinus, que 

acumula apenas 15 g por kg de biomassa húmida (resultados não publicados). Neste 

contexto, torna-se premente o desenvolvimento de um produtor industrial de 

manosilglicerato de modo a conseguir custos de produção competitivos.  

A estratégia mais promissora envolverá necessariamente a manipulação genética de 

uma estirpe industrial (nomeadamente, Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 

Bacillus subtilis) de modo a dotá-la com a capacidade para produzir manosilglicerato 

em larga escala. Esta tarefa é exequível visto que os genes envolvidos na síntese 

deste composto são conhecidos.    

Um dos objectivos do presente trabalho foi melhorar a produção de manosilglicerato 

usando uma organismo industrial. Para tal seleccionou-se a estirpe S. cerevisiae 

VSY71 que foi transformada com o plasmídeo (p425::mgsD), contendo o gene que 

codifica a enzima bifuncional manosil-3-fosfoglicerato síntase/fosfatase da bactéria 

mesofílica Dehalococcoides ethenogenes. Esta enzima sintetiza manosilglicerato a 

partir de GDP-manose e 3-fosfoglicerato. Estratégia idêntica tinha sido anteriormente 

seguida usando como hospedeiro a estirpe CEN.PK2 (Empadinhas et al., 2004), pelo 

que transformámos CEN.PK2 também com p425::mgsD e usámo-la para fins de 

comparação de produção.  

Para optimização da produção de manosilglicerato usou-se S. cerevisiae estirpe 

VSY71, contendo o plasmídeo para a síntese de manosilglicerato, e testaram-se várias 

fontes de carbono e várias salinidades no meio de crescimento. Os substratos 

rafinose, manose e galactose não conduziram à síntese de manosilglicerato, apesar 

de suportarem crescimento celular ainda que com velocidades de crescimento 

inferiores às registadas em glucose. Células cultivadas em sucrose acumularam 28 

µmol de manosilglicerato por grama de biomassa seca. Produção máxima, 90 µmol de 

manosilglicerato por grama de biomassa seca, foi observada usando glucose como 



 
v 

fonte de carbono. Este valor é cerca de duas vezes superior á produção de 

manosilglicerato observada com a estirpe S. cerevisiae CEN.PK2. Os resultados 

mostram que a produção de manosilglicerato depende em grande medida da estirpe 

utilizada pelo que há todo um trabalho de rastreio de colecções de S. cerevisiae que 

será susceptível de conduzir a produções de manosilglicerato consideravelmente 

superiores. Mesmo assim, vale a pena destacar que a estratégia seguida neste 

trabalho conduziu a um melhoramento considerável da produção específica em 

comparação com a estratégia descrita na literatura.  

 

Um segundo objectivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a eficácia de manosilglicerato na 

estabilização de proteínas in vivo, ou seja, no meio extremamente viscoso e com 

elevada concentração molecular que constitui o citoplasma celular. O esforço investido 

neste tópico teve uma dupla finalidade: i) encontrar novas aplicações para 

manosilglicerato, eventualmente relacionadas com abordagens para prevenir 

agregação proteica induzida por erros no enrolamento de cadeias polipeptídicas; ii) e 

obter evidência experimental para apoiar a hipótese de que manosilglicerato exerce de 

facto um papel protector da estrutura de proteínas in vivo. Para realizar este objectivo 

usou-se um modelo de levedura para a doença de Parkinson, no qual o gene 

codificante da ?-sinucleína humana (fundido com o gene codificante para uma 

proteína super-fluorescente) foi super-expresso em S. cerevisiae VSY72, onde 

também foi expresso o gene para a síntese de manosilglicerato. As células 

recombinantes produziram ?-sinucleína e manosilglicerato, permitindo comparar o 

efeito da presença e ausência de manosilglicerato na agregação de ??sinucleína em 

ambiente intracelular.  

?-Sinucleína é uma proteína encontrada apenas no cérebro de mamíferos. Embora a 

sua função fisiológica seja desconhecida, sabe-se que está associada a várias 

doenças neurodegenerativas (doença de Parkinson entre outras menos comuns) visto 

ser um dos componentes dos agregados proteicos que caracterizam estas patologias. 

??Sinucleína é uma proteína intrinsecamente desenrolada, isto é, a forma nativa não 

tem estrutura definida. A proteína tem tendência para auto-associação formando em 

muitos casos estruturas fibrilares, designadas amilóides. Quando produzida na 

levedura S. cerevisiae, por manipulação genética, a ??sinucleína é transportada para 

a membrana plasmática onde se ancora. A super-produção desta proteína leva à 

formação, perto da membrana, de pequenas inclusões citoplasmáticas que aumentam 

progressivamente de tamanho, originando grandes inclusões, visíveis por microscopia 

de fluorescência.  



 
vi 

Neste trabalho, usámos a estirpe VSY72 que contém duas cópias do gene da 

??sinucleína integradas no cromossoma e que foi transformada com o plasmídeo que 

contém o gene que codifica para a síntese do manosilglicerato. Como controlo foi 

usada a estirpe VSY72 transformada com o plasmídeo vazio. A produção de 

manosilglicerato é regulada por um promotor constitutivo, enquanto que a produção de 

??sinucleína é controlada por um promotor sensível à galactose. A acumulação 

intracelular de manosilglicerato (20 µmol por grama de biomassa seca) reduziu em 3,5 

vezes o número de células com inclusões de ??sinucleína, em comparação com a 

estirpe controlo (incapaz de sintetizar manosilglicerato). Estes resultados referem-se a 

células examinadas dez horas após indução da produção de ??sinucleína. Tivemos o 

cuidado de verificar que as duas estirpes apresentam níveis semelhantes de produção 

de ??sinucleína (análises por “western blot”). Em paralelo, monitorizaram-se os níveis 

de espécies reactivas de oxigénio induzidas pela produção excessiva de ??sinucleína. 

Os resultados mostraram que a presença de manosilglicerato no citoplasma causou 

uma diminuição no nível de espécies reactivas de oxigénio em comparação com o 

controlo. Por outras palavras, ao prevenir a formação de inclusões de ??sinucleína, o 

manosilglicerato diminuiu também o nível de stress oxidativo associado ao processo 

de super-expressão da proteína, possivelmente promovendo a estabilização de formas 

nativas de ??sinucleína, supostamente com menor toxicidade para a célula.  

Tendo-se demonstrado o efeito inibitório de manosilglicerato na formação de inclusões 

de ??sinucleína, pôs-se a questão de saber se este composto teria também efeito ao 

nível da solubilização de inclusões pré-formadas. Para tal, a produção de ??sinucleína 

foi induzida nove horas antes da indução da síntese de manosilglicerato, por permuta 

de meio contendo galactose para meio fresco contendo glucose como única fonte de 

carbono. Os resultados obtidos mostraram que o manosilglicerato tem uma acção de 

chaperona molecular, promovendo a desagregação das inclusões de ??sinucleína: 

uma hora após indução da síntese de manosilglicerato o número de inclusões visíveis 

por microscopia de fluorescência era 2,8 vezes inferior ao detectado em células 

controlo. 

O efeito do manosilglicerato na prevenção/solubilização de inclusões de ??sinucleína 

pode ser atribuído á activação de mecanismos celulares que conduzem à degradação 

de formas anormais de ??sinucleína, ou que promovem o seu enrolamento correcto. 

Alternativamente, o efeito benéfico observado pode resultar de uma interacção directa 

soluto/proteína que estabilize preferencialmente a estrutura nativa da ??sinucleína, 

prevenindo assim a formação de inclusões. Os resultados descritos nesta tese não 

permitem tirar conclusões definitivas sobre o tipo de mecanismo envolvido, no entanto 



 
vii 

a observação de efeitos semelhantes em ensaios in vitro monitorizados por 

microscopia electrónica (resultados de outros membros da equipa) fundamentam a 

hipótese de que interacções directas manosilglicerato/proteína terão uma contribuição 

relevante quer in vivo quer in vitro.

Introduction 
 
Compatible solutes from (hyper)thermophiles 

 
In the two last decades of the twentieth century the scientific community was amazed 

with the discovery of microbial life in environments with temperatures far outside the 

optimal range for most organisms, namely plants and animals. Such scalding habitats 

are found in terrestrial as well as in shallow or deep-marine geothermal sites (Stetter  

1995). 

Microorganisms with optimum growth temperatures between 65ºC and 80ºC are 

named thermophiles, those with optimum growth temperature equal or above 80ºC are 

designated hyperthermophiles (Blöchl et al., 1995). Most thermophiles and 

hyperthermophiles, herein designated (hyper)thermophiles, belong to the domains 

Bacteria and Archaea. Actually, the most hyperthermophilic microorganisms known to 

date are found exclusively in the domain Archaea. 

Aqueous environments are susceptible to fluctuations in the concentrations of salts. 

Therefore, microorganism that survive and proliferate in such habitats must adapt to 

the environmental osmolarity to avoid cell lysis (due to excessive water uptake) or 

dehydratation due to outflow of water molecules. Two strategies are used by 

microorganisms to cope with high salt concentration. One of them involves the influx of 

inorganic ions, generally KCl, into the cytoplasm and has been designated the “salt-in-

the-cytoplasm” type of adaptation (Galinski, 1995). The second strategy relies on the 

accumulation of small organic compounds to balance the external osmotic pressure. 

These compounds can accumulate to very high levels (molar concentration) inside the 

cells without disturbing cellular functions, and for this reason they are called 

“compatible solutes” (Brown, 1976). Besides their major role in osmoadaptation, recent 

studies have shown that compatible solutes act as protectors of cells and cell 

structures against a variety of stresses, like heat, cold, acid, free-radicals or drought. 

(da Costa et al., 1998; Argüelles, 2000; Welsh, 2000; Benaroudj et al., 2001; Santos &amp;amp; 

da Costa, 2001; Cardoso et al., 2004; Kandror et al., 2002; Mahmud et al., 2010).  

The accumulation of compatible solutes for osmoadaptation is widespread in 

organisms, ranging from archaea to bacteria, yeast filamentous fungi, algae, plants and 



 
2 

animals. Trehalose is widespread in all domains of the Tree of Life; polyols, such as 

glycerol, are commonly found in fungi and algae; ectoine or hydroxyectoine seem to be 

restricted to bacteria, while glycine betaine and ?-glutamate are usually found in 

bacteria and archaea (da Costa et al., 1998). It is interesting to note the strong 

prevalence of neutral or zwitterionic solutes in mesophilic organisms.  

Thermophiles and hyperthermophiles accumulate compatible solutes generally 

different from those found in mesophiles (Fig. 1). In respect to their chemical nature, 

solutes from (hyper)thermophiles can be divided in two categories: ?-hexose derivates 

and polyol-phosphodiesters. Among the ?-hexose derivatives, mannosylglycerate (MG) 

is the most common compound in hyperthermophiles, either bacteria or archaea 

(Bouveng et al., 1955). Mannosylglyceramide, an uncharged solute chemically related 

to MG, was found only in a few strains of Rhodothermus marinus (Silva et al., 1999). 

Mannosyl-glucosylglycerate and glucosyl-glucosylglycerate are two MG-derivatives 

found in Petrotoga spp. and in Persephonela marina, respectively (Jorge et al., 2007; 

Fernandes et al., 2010). Another related compound is glucosylglycerate, commonly 

found in halotolerant, mesophilic bacteria and archaea (Kollman et al., 1979; Robertson 

et al., 1992; Goude et al., 2004; Empadinhas &amp;amp; da Costa 2008). Among 

(hyper)thermophiles, glucosylglycerate was found only in the thermophilic bacterium 

Persephonella marina (Santos et al., 2007a).  

 

   

FIGURE 1- Compatible solutes highly restricted to (hyper)thermophiles. 

 



 
3 

Di-myo-inositol-phosphate (DIP) is a solute restricted to microorganisms with optimal 

growth temperatures above 60ºC, hence it is regarded as the most characteristic 

member of the polyol-phosphodiester group (Santos et al., 2007a). DIP is also the only 

compatible solute accumulated by the most robust hyperthermophile, Pyrolobus fumarii 

(Gonçalves et al., 2008; Blöchl et al., 1997). Other examples of the polyol-

phosphodiester group are diglycerol phosphate and glycero-phospho-inositol, which 

were found in members of the genus Archaeoglobus; the latter solute has also been 

reported in Aquifex spp. (Gonçalves et al., 2003; Lamosa et al., 2006). Two DIP-

derivates, mannosyl-myo-inositol phosphate and di-mannosyl-di-myo-inositol 

phosphate, have been found in representatives of the genera Thermotoga and Aquifex 

(Rodrigues et al., 2009). Di-N-acetyl-glucosamine phosphate is a minor solute thus far 

only found in Rubrobacter xylanophilus (Empadinhas et al., 2007). 

Examples of other solutes that do not belong to these two categories are: ?-glutamate, 

present in methanogenes (Robertson et al., 1989; Robertson et al., 1990) and also in 

hyperthermophilic bacteria (Martins et al., 1996; Lamosa et al., 2006; Fernandes et al., 

2010); aspartate that occurs in Palaecoccus and in Thermococcus spp. (Neves et al., 

2005; Lamosa et al., 1998); and 1,3,4,6-tetracarboxy-hexane and 

galactosylhydroxylysine, rare solutes found in the thermophilic archaeon, 

Methanothermobacter marburgensis and in Thermococcus litoralis, respectively 

(Gorkovenko et al., 1994; Lamosa et al., 1998; Martin et al.,1999; Müller et al.,2005). 

 

Role of the compatible solute mannosylglycerate  
 
Mannosylglycerate (MG) is accumulated in several thermophilic bacteria like Thermus 

thermophilus and Rhodothermus marinus, and also in hyperthermophiles such as 

Pyrococcus spp. and in some species of the genus Thermococcus (Santos et al., 

2007a). It is interesting to note that mannosylglycerate was initially found in an 

eukaryotic red algae from the order Ceramiales, but its role in these organisms seems 

unrelated with osmoregulation (Bouveng et al., 1955).   

The synthesis of MG in R. marinus proceeds via two pathways (Fig. 2). In the single-

step pathway, mannosylglycerate synthase catalyzes the condensation of 

GDP-mannose and D-glycerate into MG. In the other pathway (two-step pathway), the 

mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase catalyzes the conversion of GDP-mannose 

and D-3-phosphoglycerate into mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate. Dephosphorylation of 

mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate is catalyzed by mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate 

phosphatase, yielding MG (Martins et al., 1999; Borges et al., 2004). To date, R. 

marinus is the only organism known to possess the two routes for MG synthesis; 



 
4 

Pyrococcus spp., Thermus thermophilus and many other organisms synthesize MG via 

the two-step pathway (Borges et al., 2004; Empadinhas et al., 2001; Empadinhas et al., 

2003).  

An interesting finding was the discovery of a bifuncional mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate 

synthase/phosphatase in the mesophilic bacterium Dehalococcoides ethenogenes that 

catalyses the synthesis of MG at moderate temperatures. The encoding gene was 

successfully cloned in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and led to the production of MG 

(Empadinhas et al., 2004). 

 

 

FIGURE 2 – Pathways for the synthesis of mannosylglycerate. The single-step pathway using 

mannosylglycerate synthase  1  has  been characterized in R. marinus only. The two-step 

pathway involves mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase  2 and  mannosyl-3-

phosphoglycerate phosphatase  3 . The two-step pathway has been detected in many 

organisms adapted to hot environments (Santos et al., 2007a).  

 

The accumulation of MG by microorganisms is generally connected with a response to 

osmotic stress. The only exception to this behavior was found in R. marinus in which 

MG is the major solute at supra-optimal growth temperatures (Silva et al., 1999). Since 

MG is mostly found in organisms adapted to hot environments it is acceptable to 

hypothesize that it could have a role in the protection of cellular components under 

heat stress. In fact, in vitro assays with model proteins show that MG has a remarkable 

ability to improve protein thermostability, namely, in respect to structural stability 



 
5 

(measured by the melting temperature), to inhibition of aggregation induced by heat, 

and to protection against heat inactivation (Ramos et al.,1997, Borges et al., 2004, 

Faria et al., 2003, Faria et al., 2008). Therefore, MG is a valuable compound from the 

biotechnological point of view, and several patents have been filled by our group and 

others (Santos et al., 1996; Santos et al., 1998; da Costa et al., 2003; Lamosa et al., 

2006; Lentzen &amp;amp; Schwarz, 2006). Two of the patents originating in our team have been 

licensed to a German company bitop AG, Witten (http://www.bitop.de). Major potential 

fields of application are: the cosmetic industry, as moisturizer and skin protector 

against UV damage, storage of vaccines and other biomaterials, protein stabilizer in 

analytical and clinical kits, and in biosensors. In particular, MG proved to increase the 

life-span of retroviral vectors (Cruz et al., 2006) and to improve DNA microarray 

experiments (Mascellani et al., 2007). 

The major bottleneck towards the industrial utilization of MG is the high production 

costs. Although a procedure for the chemical synthesis of MG has been developed 

(Lamosa et al., 2006), the yield is very poor. Therefore, the solution for this difficulty 

should reside in an optimized fermentation process. Currently, commercial MG is 

produced (gram amounts) from fermentation and “milking” of R. marinus, a natural 

producer. However, the high production cost prevents a wide utilization of this 

compound. In this context, the development of an efficient industrial producer of MG is 

mandatory. 

 

Yeast as industrial and model organism 
 
Since ancient times the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used in the 

production of food and alcoholic beverages (Mortimer, 2000). In addition to the 

traditional utilization in the food industry, yeast is also an excellent host for the 

production of recombinant proteins, offering straightforward genetic tools and highly 

optimized cultivation processes. Fast growth rates up to huge cell density make it 

probably the most important industrial organism (Goffeau et al., 1996). Moreover, 

yeasts are able to perform complex eukaryotic-type post-translational modifications and 

are able to produce proteins similar to those of mammalian origin. Since the early 

1980s, a number of vaccines, antigens, hormones and other bio-therapeutic 

compounds have reached to a commercial production. That is the case of insulin, 

interferon and hepatitis A, among others (Hitzeman et al., 1984; Valenzuela et al., 

1982). 

In addition to this biotechnological importance, yeast is recognized as a basic 

eukaryotic model system (Botstein et al., 1997). More specifically, the baker’s yeast 



 
6 

(Saccharomyces cerevisiae) has been proven very useful to understanding 

fundamental cellular and molecular processes (Botstein et al., 1997). Despite the 

evolutionary distance between yeast and higher eukaryotes (including humans), a high 

level of conservation is shared in several cellular mechanisms such as, DNA 

replication, cell division, protein turnover, vesicular trafficking, aging, and cell death 

(Sugiyama et al., 2009). 

S. cerevisiae is an attractive organism to work since it is non-pathogenic, very simple 

and inexpensive to manipulate and easy to maintain as stable haploids or diploids. The 

duplication time of S. cerevisiae is around 90 min in complex medium; moreover, cells 

are easily transformable and it is straightforward to integrate foreign genes in the 

genome (Sugiyama et al., 2009).  

The sequence of the yeast genome was completed 14 years ago (Suter et al., 2006); 

presently, around 80% of the 6000 encoding genes have a predicted function (Christie 

et al., 2009). A very active and collaborative yeast research community built a series of 

biological resources such as, the yeast gene deletion strains (YGDS), where every 

protein-coding gene in the genome was deleted (Winzeler et al., 1999); the green 

fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged collection of strains, where each gene was tagged 

with GFP (Huh et al., 2003); and a strain collection engineered for protein over-

production (Jones et al., 2008). Another major advantage of the yeast system is the 

availability of a rich and easily accessible dataset on genetic interactions, protein-

protein interactions, transcriptional changes and protein localization (Gitler, 2008). 

In summary, the powerful genetic resources together with the extensive accumulated 

knowledge makes this simple yeast a key-organism for applied as well as for basic 

research. 

 

?-Synuclein as a model to study protein stabilization 
 
?-Synuclein (?-Syn) is an intrinsically unfolded protein with 140 amino acids present 

only in mammalian brains (Jo et al., 2000). This protein has a tendency to self-

assemble and aggregate, and is associated with several devastating 

neurodegenerative diseases, known as synucleinopathies (Cole et al., 2002). ?-Syn 

comprises an N-terminal region that acts as a membrane binding domain (Fig. 3), a 

central hydrophobic domain, essential for oligomerization and fibrilization, and a 

C-terminal domain that hinders aggregation for its high solubility (Davidson et al., 1998; 

Ulmer et al., 2005; Georgieva et al., 2008).

FIGURE 3 – Primary and secondary structure of wild-type ?-Syn. Three main domains can be 

considered: the N-terminus that confers ?-helix structure, a central hydrophobic domain (NAC) 

that confers ?-sheet and is essential for oligomerization, and a C-terminus that promotes protein 

solubilization. Adapted from Vamvaca et al., 2009. 

 

This protein is natively unfolded and when associated with membranes forms two 

?-helices in the N-terminal region (Fig. 4). An increment in the concentration of ?-Syn 

nearby the plasmatic membrane facilitates the formation of dimers on the membrane 

surface or in the cytoplasm. Through dimerization, ?-Syn adopts ?-sheet secondary 

structure and can associate with other monomers or dimers leading to oligomer 

formation. The oligomers act as nuclei for fibril formation and amyloid deposits 

(Reviewed in Auluck et al., 2010).

Effects of ?-synuclein in yeast physiology  
 
In yeast, ?-Syn is delivered to the plasma membrane via the classical secretory 

pathway: the protein migrates from the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi 

apparatus and is further transported to the plasma membrane in secretory vesicles 

(Outeiro &amp;amp; Linquist, 2003; Dixon et al., 2005). ER is the first compartment encountered 

by ?-Syn, where it impairs the docking and fusion of ER vesicles into the Golgi 

apparatus (Cooper et al., 2006). As a consequence, these vesicles accumulate near 

the plasma membrane (Soper et al., 2008). The accumulation of ?-Syn close to the 

plasma membrane leads to the formation of small inclusions that progressively grow in 

size towards the cytoplasm. Some of these inclusions stain positive for thioflavin-S 

confirming the presence of ?-sheet in ?-Syn aggregates, while others are ?-Syn-

induced aggregates of cytoplasmic vesicles (Outeiro &amp;amp; Linquist, 2003; Zabrocki et al., 

2005). 

Another consequence of ER stress is the over-production of reactive oxygen species 

(ROS), which indirectly stimulate the production of ROS in the mitochondria and 

activates apoptosis (Flower et al., 2005). Moreover, ?-Syn over-production induces the 

impairment of the proteasome activity as a result of modifications in the proteasome 

composition. It is believed that these alterations derive from abnormal protein synthesis 

in the ER (Chen et al., 2005). Another effect of ER malfunction is the retardation of  

endocytosis, caused by the obstruction in post-vesicle internalization steps and defects 

in vacuolar fusion (Outeiro &amp;amp; Linquist, 2003; Zabrocki et al.,2008). 

Toxicity of ?-Syn in yeast cells also stems from post-translational modifications 

catalyzed by enzymes such as, acetyltransferase B complex (acetylation) and casein 

kinases I and II (phosphorylation), among others ( Zabrocki et al.,2008). Nevertheless, 

?-Syn toxicity is dependent on the genetic background and type of plasmid used. In 

fact, certain yeast strains display a high number of ?-Syn inclusions without showing 

any growth defect; conversely, ?-Syn over-production may be highly toxic to cells 

without inclusion formation (Sharma et al., 2006; Zabrocki et al., 2005). 

 

 

Aim of this work 

 

The fermentation of the baker´s yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to produce 

high-value products is a common practice in industry. Since the use of native 

producers, such as Rhodothermus marinus, for the production of MG is not 

economically feasible, we set out to optimize the production of MG using engineered 

strains of S. cerevisiae.

A second objective of this work is to assess the efficacy of MG for the stabilization of 

proteins in vivo, i.e., in the molecular overcrowded medium that constitutes the 

cytoplasm of living cells. This research effort has a dual purpose: i) to find novel 

applications for MG, related with its potential ability to suppress protein aggregation 

inside the cells; ii) and, to obtain experimental evidence in support of the hypothesis 

that MG acts as a protector of protein structures in vivo. To this end, we took 

advantage of a yeast model for Parkinson´s disease and investigated the effect of MG 

on the aggregation of ?-synuclein, by over-producing this aggregating-prone protein 

together with the MG-biosynthetic enzymes.

Strains and genetic procedures 

S. cerevisiae strain VSY71 (a derivative of W303-1A (MATa, ade2-1, can1-100, ura3-1, 

leu2-3,112, his3-11,15, trp1-1) with the plasmids pRS306::URA3 and pRS304::TRP1 

integrated in the chromosome)) and strain CEN.PK2 (MATa/MATa, ura3-52/ura3-52,

) were 

transformed with the plasmid p425::msgD. The plasmid p425::msgD, containing the 

msgD gene that encodes the bifunctional mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate 

synthase/phosphatase from Dehalococcoides ethenogenes, was kindly provided by 

Dr. Milton S. da Costa (University of Coimbra).  

S. cerevisiae cells were transformed with the plasmid p425::msgD by using the 

standard lithium acetate (LiOAc) procedure (Guthrie &amp;amp; Fink, 1991) with slight 

modifications. Briefly, cells were grown overnight in liquid synthetic complete medium 

(SC medium) with 2% glucose at 30ºC and 140 rpm. After harvesting by centrifugation 

(7000 × g, 10 min, 4ºC), cells were re-suspended in water to a final concentration of 5 

× 10
8
 cells/ml. An aliquot (5 ml) was collected, centrifuged, and re-suspended in 360 µl 

of a solution containing 33% (w/v) poly(ethylene glycol) 3350,  0.1 M LiOAc, 0.3 mg/ml 

boiled salmon sperm DNA, and 1 µg plasmid DNA. The cell suspension was incubated 

in a water bath at 42
º
C for 1 h, and then cells were washed with water, and plated onto 

selective solid medium. The transformants derived from the strain VSY71 were 

selected in SC medium without uracil, leucine, and tryptophan; the transformants 

derived from the strain CEN.PK2 were isolated in SC medium without leucine. 

 

Growth conditions 

S. cerevisiae strains (VSY71 and CEN.PK2) harboring the plasmid p425::msgD, were 

grown in appropriate selective medium supplemented with 2% glucose (glucose 

medium) at 30ºC and 140 rpm. Cell growth was monitored by measuring the turbidity at 

600 nm (OD600). To determine the effect of different carbon sources in the production of 

MG in this mutant, cells were grown overnight in SC medium supplemented with 2% of 

the following carbon sources: glucose, sucrose, mannose, raffinose, and galactose. 



 
11 

Each overnight-grown culture was diluted to a final OD600 of 0.1 with fresh SC medium 

supplemented with the respective carbon source to a final volume of 200 ml. The 

cultures were incubated at 30ºC and 140 rpm. At the mid-exponential phase (OD600 = 

1.6), cells were centrifuged (7000 × g, 10 min, 4ºC), washed with water, and frozen at 

-20ºC until further analysis. The effect on growth of the NaCl concentration was also 

studied. Cells were grown at 37ºC in medium containing different NaCl concentrations 

(0%, 2%, 3%, and 4%, wt/vol). Samples of each culture (200 ml) were removed during 

the mid-exponential phase and the pool of compatible solutes was determined in cell 

extracts by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. 

 

Extraction and quantification of intracellular organic solutes 

Ethanol-chloroform extracts of S. cerevisiae strains were performed as previously 

described (Santos et al., 2006). Briefly, a culture of 200 ml was grown until 

mid-exponential phase, harvested, and centrifuged (7000 × g, 10 min, 4ºC). 

Compatible solutes were extracted from cells by boiling for 10 min with 80% ethanol. 

The extraction was repeated twice and the combined extracts evaporated to dryness 

under negative pressure; the residue was re-suspended in water:chloroform (1:3, v/v), 

and centrifuged to remove solid components. The aqueous extracts were lyophilized 

and re-suspended in D2O for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. For 

compatible solute quantification purposes, formate was added as a concentration 

standard, and the 
1
H-NMR spectra was acquired with a repetition delay of 60 s on a 

Bruker AMX 300 spectrometer. A sample of cell culture (5 ml) was removed, passed 

through a 0.22 µm pore filter (Millipore, USA), and the filter was dried overnight at 85ºC 

in order to determine dry mass.

Strains and genetic procedures 

Multi-copy plasmids for ?-Syn expression - S. cerevisiae strain CEN.PK2 was 

transformed with the p426GPD::SNCA(wt)EGFP and the respective transformants 

were designated “?-Syn mutant”. In addition, strain CEN.PK2 was transformed with a 

combination of the following plasmids: (p426GPD::SNCA(wt)EGFP plus pRS425); 

(p426GPD::SNCA(wt)EGFP plus p425::msgD); (p426GPD::SNCA(wt)EGFP plus 

p425::msgD); (pRS425 plus p426GPD). Transformants were designated 

“?-Syn/pRS425 mutant”, “?-Syn/MG mutant”, and “p426GPD/pRS425 mutant”, 

respectively. The phenotype of each mutant is described in Table 2. The plasmid

p426GPD::SNCA(wt)EGFP, containing the ?-Syn gene fused in the N-terminus with an 

EGFP gene (enhanced green fluorescent protein), and p426GPD, were kindly provided 

by Dr. Tiago Outeiro (IMM, Portugal). The plasmid pRS425 was kindly provided by Dr. 

Milton S. da Costa (Coimbra University). The plasmids used are multi-copy plasmids 

containing constitutive promoters, and are listed in Table 1. Transformants were 

selected in SC medium without uracil and leucine and supplemented with 2% glucose.

Integrative plasmids for ?-Syn production - Strain VSY72 (a derivative of W303-1A 

(MATa, ade2-1, can1-100, ura3-1, leu2-3,112, his3-11,15, trp1-1) with plasmids 

p406::SNCA(wt)EGFP and p404::SNCA(wt)EGFP integrated in the chromosome)) was 

kindly provided by Dr. Tiago Outeiro (IMM, Portugal). This strain has two copies of the 

SNCA(wt)EGFP gene integrated in the genome (Fleming et al., 2008). The expression 

of ?-Syn is controlled by a galactose inducible promoter, allowing synchronizing 

expression of ?-Syn. This strain was transformed with the plasmids p425::msgD or 

pRS425 (Table 1). Selection was carried out in SC medium without uracil, leucine, and 



 
13 

tryptophan supplemented with 2% of glucose, leading to the isolation of MG and 

Control mutant strains, respectively (Table 2). 

 

Growth conditions 

S. cerevisiae mutants with multi-copy plasmids – Initially, the effect of MG on the 

inhibition of ?-Syn aggregation was investigated using the S. cerevisiae strain 

CEN.PK2 producing ?-Syn and MG (?-Syn/MG mutant); the respective control mutants 

(?-Syn/pRS425 and p426GPD/pRS425 mutants) were used for comparison. Cells were 

grown overnight at 30ºC and 140 rpm in glucose medium, and diluted to with fresh 

medium to a final volume of 400 ml (OD600 of 0.1). Cell growth was monitored by 

measuring the OD600. Culture samples were withdrawn at early, mid-exponential, and 

late-exponential phases, and the percentage of cells with ?-Syn inclusions was 

determined by fluorescence microscopy (details described below). 

 

S. cerevisiae mutants with integrative plasmids – We found that mutants with multi-

copy plasmids were unstable, i.e., the level of ?-Syn decreased considerably in 

successive growths. Therefore, we resorted to an alternative strategy that used 

integrative plasmids. The S. cerevisiae strain VSY72 producing ?-Syn and MG (MG 

mutant) and the strain VSY72, producing only ?-Syn (Control mutant), were grown in 

50 ml glucose medium until mid-exponential, centrifuged (7000 × g, 10 min, 4ºC), and 

re-suspended in TE buffer (Tris-HCl 10 mM, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5). This cell suspension 

was used to inoculate 600 ml of SC medium supplemented with galactose (galactose 

medium) to a final OD600 of 0.2. Culture samples (200 ml) were removed during the 

early-exponential phase (10 and 12 hours), and compatible solutes were extracted and 

quantified as described above. The dry mass was calculated using 20 ml of culture. 

Culture samples were also collected at 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours after induction and 

the percentage of cells with ?-Syn inclusions was determined by fluorescence 

microscopy (details described below).  

To evaluate the ability of MG to promote solubilization of the ?-Syn inclusions, MG and 

Control mutants were grown in 50 ml of SC medium supplemented with 2% raffinose 

(raffinose medium) until mid-exponential phase (around 40 h). At this stage, cells were 

harvested, re-suspended in TE buffer, and inoculated in 600 ml of galactose medium to 

a final OD600 of 0.2. After allowing for 9 h of growth in this medium, the galactose 

medium was replaced by glucose medium. After 1 and 3 hours of growth in glucose 

medium, the following sample volumes were collected; 200 ml for solute analysis; 20 

ml for dry mass determination; and 20 ml for western blot analysis.

Fluorescence microscopy 

Fluorescence microscopy analysis was performed with a Zeiss AxioImager (Zeiss, 

Oberkochen, Germany) microscope. Cells were observed with a 63x/1.4 (Zeiss Plan-

APO oil) objective and a GFP filter. For each culture sample, a total of 300 cells were 

inspected for the presence of ?-Syn inclusions. The percentage of cells with ?-Syn 

inclusions was determined by dividing the number of cells containing at least one 

inclusion of ?-Syn by the total number of cells counted, and multiplication by 100.  

 

Western blot analysis 

S. cerevisiae cells were harvested and washed with water. For each culture sample, 

the number of cells per ml was determined with a Neubauer chamber. Samples 

containing 6.1 x 10
7 

cells were taken, re-suspended in SDS/PAGE buffer (Laemmli, 

1970), and boiled for 10 min. Proteins were then separated in a 10% SDS/PAGE gel 

and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millippore, USA) for 

?-Syn detection. The membranes were treated for 1 h at room temperature with a 

blocking solution (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% (w/v) milk, and 0.1 % 

(v/v) tween 20). Then, membranes were incubated overnight with monoclonal antibody 

against ?-Syn from mouse (BD Transduction Laboratories
TM

) in blocking solution using 

a dilution of 1:6000. After incubation, membranes were washed 3 times with TBS buffer 

(150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5) and 0.1% (v/v) tween 20, and incubated for 1 h 

with the secondary antibody anti-mouse IgG (GE healthcare) diluted in 1:1000 in 

blocking solution. A chemoluminescence detection kit (Millipore, USA) was used to 

visualize ?-Syn. 

 

ROS assay 

To determine the amount of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in Control and MG 

mutants, we used the dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR 123) staining (Madeo et al., 2002). 

The DHR123 is oxidized intracellularly by ROS into rhodamine 123, which emit 

fluorescence at 535 nm when excited at 485 nm. To perform this assay, the mutants 

were grown in glucose medium until mid-exponential phase and then centrifuged. 

Subsequently, the mutants were re-suspended in galactose medium to induce the 

?-Syn expression and allowed to grow for 9 h. In addition, as a negative control 

experiment, the Control mutant was re-suspended in fresh glucose medium, and 

growth was allowed for 9 hours. Aliquots of the three cultures, containing 1 × 10
6 

cells, 

were collected and incubated with DHR 123 dye (final concentration 5 µg/ml) for 1 h. 

The fluorescence intensity of the samples was measured with a Varian Cary Eclipse 

spectrofluorimeter (Varian, USA).

Results 
 

Effect of different carbon sources in the production of mannosylglycerate by 

recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains 

Currently, mannosylglycerate (MG) is purified from natural producing organisms 

(namely Rhodothermus marinus). The extraction and purification yield is very low, and 

therefore, the process is not economically feasible. In this work, we used strains of S. 

cerevisiae engineered for the synthesis of MG; moreover, several carbon sources were 

tested in an attempt to optimize MG production. The MG-engineered yeast strain 

VSY71, harboring the plasmid for MG synthesis, was grown in medium supplemented 

with glucose. Under these conditions, the amount of MG determined was 90 µmol/g dry 

mass (Table 3). Among all tested carbon sources, growth of S. cerevisiae strain VSY71 

in glucose-containing medium led to the production of the highest amount of MG. When 

sucrose was used as a carbon source, the amount of MG decreased 69% (28.1 µmol/g 

dry mass). No MG accumulation was detected when the strain VSY71 was grown in 

SC medium supplemented with mannose, galactose, or raffinose (Table 3). For the 

purpose of comparison, we engineered strain CEN.PK2 to produce MG, as described 

by Empadinhas et al., 2004, and determined the production of MG in glucose medium. 

Under these conditions, the MG-engineered strain CEN.PK2 produced 44 µmol of MG 

per gram of dry mass (Table 3), which represents only 48% of the amount produced by 

strain VSY71.

(w/v) of NaCl. Analysis of ethanol-chloroform extracts derived from these cultures did 

not result in an increase in the production of MG in comparison with the same strain 

grown in medium without NaCl (data not shown). Instead, we observed the 

accumulation of low levels of trehalose (0.9 µmol/g dry mass) and high amounts of 

glycerol (134.7 µmol/g dry mass), two compatible solutes known to accumulate in S. 

cerevisiae in response to osmotic stress (Albertyn et al., 1994; Hounsa et al., 1998). 

 

Effect of mannosylglycerate on the formation of ?-Syn inclusions – use of multi-

copy plasmids to express the gene encoding ?-Syn 

The inhibitory effect of MG on the aggregation of several model proteins has been 

demonstrated in vitro (Santos et al., 2007a). However, it is not known whether MG 

maintains this ability in the molecular overcrowded milieu that constitutes the cell 

cytoplasm. To achieve this goal, we constructed a S. cerevisiae mutant that 

accumulates MG and concomitantly produces ?-Syn, an aggregating-prone protein that 

self-aggregates without further stimuli. In a first attempt we used the S. cerevisiae 

strain CEN.PK2 containing the plasmid for MG synthesis and transformed these cells 

with a plasmid encoding ?-Syn fused with the EGFP tag. The genes were expressed 

constitutively in 2µ plasmids, a type of yeast plasmid with a high transcription rate.

(WT) and the ?-Syn mutant harboring the plasmid for ?-Syn expression. B, Fluorescence 

microscopy of the ?-Syn mutant during the early exponential phase of growth. 



 
17 

Growth of the ?-Syn mutant was strongly inhibited when compared to the wild-type 

strain, indicating that the over-production of ?-Syn is toxic to yeast cells (Fig. 5A). 

Fluorescence microscopy analysis of the ?-Syn mutant revealed the presence of ?-Syn 

inclusions in the cytoplasm in the majority of the cell population (Fig. 5B).  

In order to evaluate the effect of MG in aggregation of ?-Syn the following mutants 

were constructed: a strain producing only ?-Syn (containing also the empty plasmid 

pRS425), designated ?-Syn/pRS425 mutant; a strain producing ?-Syn and MG, 

?-Syn/MG mutant; and a strain containing the two empty plasmids used to produce 

?-Syn and MG, p426GPD/pRS425 mutant (see Materials and Methods for details). 

These mutants were cultivated successively 3 times and stock cultures were frozen at 

-80ºC. Surprisingly, no differences in the growth profiles of the four mutants were 

observed (Fig. 6A), in contrast with the initial observations (Fig. 5).  

 

 

FIGURE 6. Successive growths show that yeast was able to overcome ?-Syn toxicity. A, No 

significant differences in the growth curves of mutants were observed after 3 successive 

growths. B, Successive growth curves of ?-Syn mutant. The first culture (1) served as pre-

culture for the second culture (2), which served as pre-culture for the third culture (3). C, 

Successive growths of the ?-Syn/pRS425 mutant as in B. These experiments were repeated 3 

times with similar results.  

 



 
18 

The constructions were repeated using the same methodology leading again to similar 

growth profiles for all the mutants. To understand why production of ?-Syn did not 

inhibit growth as it did in the initial experiment, we monitored growth, localization of ?-

Syn in the cell, and ?-Syn production during the 3 successive growths. 

Surprisingly, the successive cultivations of the mutants ?-Syn/pRS425 and ?-Syn/MG 

produced different growth curves. During the successive growths, the lag phase 

progressively decreased and the growth rate increased (Fig. 6, panels B and C). 

Moreover, fluorescence microscopy analysis of the cells during the mid-exponential 

phase, in the successive cultures, showed a marked decrease in the number of cells 

exhibiting cytoplasmatic inclusions of ?-Syn (Fig. 7A). To rule out the possibility that 

these results (less cells with inclusions) were due to a decrease in the level of ?-Syn 

production, we determined the level of ?-Syn by western blot. These analyses showed 

a progressive decrease in the expression of the gene coding for ?-Syn over the 

successive growths, as illustrated in Fig. 7B.  

 

 

 

FIGURE 7.  The production of ?-Syn decreases in successive cultivations of the ?-Syn/pRS425 

mutant. A, Fluorescence microscopy of each of the three cultures examined during the 

mid-exponential phase. B, Level of ?-Syn over the successive growths as determined by 

western blot analysis in the first
 
culture (1), the second culture (2) and the third culture (3). 

 

Two hypotheses can be put forward to explain the decrease of ?-Syn production in the 

successive growths: (1) ?-Syn production does not lead to a homogeneous population 

of cells harboring inclusions, in other words, there are cells presenting inclusions and 

cells without them. Therefore, successive growths may favor cells that do not exhibit 

?-Syn inclusions as they could have a higher growth rate; (2) Considering that high 



 
19 

levels of ?-Syn are highly toxic to the yeast cells, there might be a selective pressure to 

reduce the number of plasmid copies without compromising auxotrophy. As a 

consequence of a lower production of ?-Syn, cells would be able to avoid toxicity 

(Outeiro &amp;amp; Linquist, 2003; Zabrocki et al., 2005).  

To prevent the observed decrease in ?-Syn production we constructed a yeast strain 

that contains two copies of the ?-Syn gene integrated in the genome, thereby 

preventing the decrease in the plasmid copy numbers. Moreover, a galactose-inducible 

promoter was used to enable a precise control of the timing for ?-Syn expression.  

 

Effect of mannosylglycerate on the formation of ?-Syn inclusions – use of 

integrative plasmids to express ?-Syn 

The strain VSY72 contains two copies of the ?-Syn gene integrated in the genome, 

which are under the control of a galactose inducible promoter. This strain was used as 

host for the construction of two mutants. In one of them, the plasmid p425::msgD, 

containing the gene encoding the activities involved in the synthesis of MG was 

introduced in strain VSY72. This mutant was designated as “MG mutant”. In the second 

mutant, the empty plasmid (pRS425) was introduced in strain VSY72, and designated 

as “Control mutant”. According to established protocols for ?-Syn production, 

S. cerevisiae cells were cultivated overnight in SC medium supplemented with 2% 

raffinose, and then shifted to medium supplemented with 2% galactose (Outeiro &amp;amp; 

Linquist, 2003). However, these experimental conditions did not lead to production of 

MG in the MG mutant (Table 4a). To overcome this difficulty, different combinations of 

carbon sources were tested in order to determine the growth condition, in which the 

number of cytoplasmatic ?-Syn inclusions and the accumulation of MG were maximal. 

The accumulation of MG was determined using the MG mutant, while the formation of 

?-Syn inclusions was monitored using the Control mutant (Table 4a and 4b). The 

highest MG accumulation (90 µmol/g dry mass) was observed when the MG mutant 

was pre-cultivated in glucose, and then cultivated in 2% glucose or in 1% glucose plus 

1% galactose (Table 4a). Under these growth conditions, we did not observe any 

cytoplasmatic inclusions of ?-Syn in the Control mutant (Table 4b). When this mutant 

was grown in a mixture of 0.4% glucose plus 1.6% galactose, the number of cells 

containing cytoplasmatic inclusions increased to 20%. Under these growth conditions, 

the MG mutant accumulated 60 µmol MG/g dry mass. Indeed, high concentrations of 

glucose have a repression effect on the galactose metabolism. It is known that glucose 

inhibits the expression of the galactose permease, and consequently blocks galactose 

uptake (Nehlin et al., 1991).

When the medium was supplemented with 2% galactose, the MG mutant accumulated 

20 µmol MG/g dry mass and around 40% of the cells of the Control mutant exhibited 

?-Syn inclusions (Table 4a and 4b). Therefore, these conditions (cells grown overnight 

in glucose medium, and then re-suspended in 2% galactose), were selected as the 

most appropriate for further experiments. Sample aliquots were removed during the 

period of galactose induction, and the cells were examined by fluorescent microscopy. 

After 4 hours of galactose induction, ?-Syn appeared evenly distributed in the 

cytoplasm and localized intensely in the cytoplasmatic membrane. After 8 hours of 

induction, ?-Syn is mainly localized in the cytoplasmatic membrane. Continuous 

production of ?-Syn leads to the formation of small inclusions near the cytoplasmatic 

membrane. At 10 hours of induction, the size of cytoplasmatic inclusions increased and 

they are dispersed through the cytoplasm. This phenotype is transitory, since after 12 

hours, the percentage of cells with ?-Syn inclusions decreased and at 24 h no cells 

with cytoplasmatic ?-Syn inclusions were visualized (Fig. 8).

FIGURE 8. Localization of ?-Syn in the Control mutant at different time points after induction 

with galactose. Between 4 and 6 hours of galactose induction, the fluorescence is localized in 

the cytoplasmatic membrane. At 8 hours, the ?-Syn protein is mainly concentrated in the 

cytoplasmatic membrane. With the increase in the concentration of ?-Syn, small cytoplasmatic 

inclusions of ?-Syn were observed close to the cytoplasmatic membrane. These inclusions 

enlarge and extend through the cell until 10 h post-induction. At 12 h after induction, the 

number of cytoplasmatic inclusions starts to decrease and at 24 h cells showed no inclusions. 

 

The effect of MG in the formation of cytoplasmatic ?-Syn inclusions was determined at 

10 and 12 h after galactose induction by comparing the percentage of cells with 

inclusions in the MG mutant and the Control mutant (Fig. 9A and 9B). 

Upon 10 h of induction, 38.6 ± 4.9% of cells expressing only ?-Syn (Control mutant) 

exhibited cytoplasmatic inclusions of ?-Syn. This value should be compared with 

11.5 ± 5.4% for the mutant expressing ?-Syn plus MG (MG mutant). NMR analysis of 

the ethanolic/chloroformic extracts of Control and MG mutants showed no MG and 19.6 

µmol MG/g dry mass, respectively (Fig. 9C). We also detected the presence of 

trehalose, a compatible solute accumulated naturally by S. cerevisiae. It is known that 

trehalose acts as a stress protectant of proteins and biological membranes (Singer &amp;amp; 

Linquist, 1998). Nevertheless, we verified that there was no significant difference in the 

level of trehalose between the two mutants, indicating that the inhibitory effect of Syn 

aggregation observed in the MG mutant is related with MG accumulation and not with 

trehalose accumulation. Interestingly, besides the pronounced effect of MG in the 

number of cells with cytoplasmatic inclusions, the two mutants showed similar growth 

rates (data not show). To prove that ?-Syn was produced to similar levels in the two 

mutants, we performed western blot analysis with cells collected at 10 h after induction 

(Fig. 9D).

Cells were grown in glucose medium to allow intracellular accumulation of mannosylglycerate 

and switched to galactose medium to induce ?-Syn production. A, Percentage of cells showing 

inclusions without and with accumulation of mannosylglycerate. The MG mutant contains a 

bifunctional enzyme that synthesizes mannosylglycerate from GDP-mannose and 

3-phosphoglycerate, and Control mutant contains the empty plasmid pRS425. Data shown are 

derived from three independent experiments; for each experiment 300 cells were counted. B,

We also investigated the ability of MG to promote solubilization of ?-Syn inclusions in 

vivo. For that, Control and MG mutants were grown in raffinose until mid-exponential to 

avoid MG accumulation, then cells were shifted to galactose medium and cultivated for 

further 9 h to form cytoplasmatic inclusions of ?-Syn; finally, cells were shifted to 

glucose medium to allow MG accumulation. Aliquots were removed at 1 and 3 hours 

after the switch to glucose medium, and cells were analyzed for ?-Syn inclusions 

(fluorescence microscopy), MG accumulation (NMR analysis of cell extracts), and 

?-Syn content (western blot). Upon the switch to glucose medium, ?-Syn production 

was repressed and as result the number of cells presenting cytoplasmatic inclusions 

decreased. After the shift to glucose medium, there was a significant decrease in the 



 
23 

number of cells with cytoplasmatic inclusions in the MG mutant as compared with the 

Control mutant (Fig. 10A). After 1 h in glucose medium, 12.7±4.2 % of MG mutant cells 

exhibited cytoplasmatic inclusions of ?-Syn, while 33.3±6.7 % of Control mutant cells 

had cytoplasmatic inclusions of ?-Syn. The difference was more pronounced after 3 h 

in glucose medium: 15.0±7.0% of Control mutant cells contained cytoplasmatic ?-Syn 

inclusions, to compare with 4.7±3.5% in the MG mutant. The MG content was 12 and 

22 µmol/g dry mass for cultures removed at 1 and 3 hours, respectively (Fig. 10B). 

Western blot showed that ?-Syn was expressed in Control and MG mutant in similar 

amounts (Fig. 10C).  

 

 

FIGURE 10. Mannosylglycerate promotes solubilization of the cytoplasmatic inclusions of 

?-Syn. MG and Control mutants were cultivated in galactose for 9 h, period of time where we 

observed the highest amount of cells with inclusions (42%), and then shifted to glucose medium 

to allow MG accumulation. Then, aliquots were removed at 1 and 3 hours to calculate: A) 

Percentage of cells with cytoplasmatic inclusions of ?-Syn; B) Intracellular amount of 

mannosylglycerate in the MG mutant; and to analyze C) Levels of ?-Syn expression by western 

blot in both mutants after 1 hour in glucose medium. The data correspond to three independent 

experiments. 

 

Effect of MG on the amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by ?-Syn 

over-production  

It is well known that ?-Syn over-production leads to the formation of ROS and hydrogen 

peroxide (Flower et al., 2005). We used DHR 123 staining, a well establish method to 



 
24 

detect the presence of ROS. This dye accumulates in the cell and is oxidized by ROS, 

thereby emitting a fluorescence signal.  

Control mutant was cultured in glucose (no production of ?-Syn) and also in galactose 

(high production of ?-Syn). The MG mutant was only cultured in galactose. As 

expected, the production of ?-Syn in the Control mutant increased 3-fold the amount of 

ROS in comparison with the same cells without ?-Syn production (Fig. 11). 

MG-producing cells had ROS levels 30% lower than cells producing only ?-Syn, 

suggesting that MG prevents the accumulation of ROS.  

 

FIGURE 11. ROS levels are reduced by the accumulation of mannosylglycerate. Control mutant 

was grown in medium supplemented with glucose (no production of ?-Syn) or galactose (high 

production of ?-Syn), while MG mutant was grown only in the presence of galactose. ROS 

accumulation in these mutants was quantified by fluorescence upon 9 h of cultivation using the 

DHR 123 staining method. Data represents the average of three independent experiments. 

 

The results presented in Figs. 9 and 11 indicate that MG accumulation in yeast cells 

prior to ?-Syn production decreases ?-Syn aggregation and the accumulation of ROS.

Discussion 
 
Microorganisms can accumulate high levels of compatible solutes, making them good 

candidates for the large-scale production of these compounds (Lentzen &amp;amp; Schwarz, 

2006). However, the applicability of these bioprocesses demands that the relevant 

microbial cultures grow fast, to very high cell densities in industrial scale fermentors. 

Alternatively, these solutes can be produced in organisms commonly used in industrial 

bioprocesses (e.g. E. coli, yeast, Bacillus spp.) after modification of metabolic 

pathways or insertion of foreign genes (Lentzen &amp;amp; Schwarz, 2006).  

In this work, we optimized the production of mannosylglycerate (MG) using the yeast 

Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a robust organism that is well-established as an industrial 

producer. Empadinhas et al., (2004) reported the construction of a S. cerevisiae strain 

engineered for the production of MG by expression of the gene msgD encoding 

mannosy-3-phosphoglycerate synthase/phosphatase, the activities involved in MG 

synthesis. This recombinant strain accumulated a maximum of 49 µmol/g dry mass of 

MG in medium supplemented with glucose (Empadinhas et al., 2004). In this work we 

followed a similar strategy, but used as host the S. cerevisiae strain VSY71. We 

observed a maximal intracellular concentration of MG of 90 µmol/g dry mass 

(approximately 0.24 µmol/mg protein) in cells grown in glucose as the sole carbon 

source.  

In order to optimize MG production, the strain VSY71, harboring the msgD gene, was 

cultivated in different carbon sources, such as raffinose, galactose, mannose, and 

sucrose. Among the carbon sources examined, MG formation was only observed when 

cells were grown on sucrose; however, the MG content in sucrose-grown cells 

decreased 31% in comparison with cells grown in glucose.  

The engineered strain grew on raffinose, galactose or mannose with a growth yield 

comparable to that on glucose, although with a clearly lower growth rate (data not 

shown). It is known that yeast uses ultimately the glycolytic pathway to metabolize 

raffinose, galactose or mannose (Kruckeberg &amp;amp; Dickinson, 2004), thus it is curious that 

cells grown on these sugars are unable to produce detectable amounts of MG. It is 

conceivable that synthesis of MG in these cells is limited by substrate availability, 

namely GDP-mannose and/or 3-phosphoglycerate. The mannose moiety in 

GDP-mannose originates from mannose-6-phosphate, which is formed by 



 
26 

isomerization of fructose-6-phosphate, a glycolytic intermediate metabolite, like 

3-phosphoglycerate. We speculate that lower glycolytic rates on sugars other than 

glucose could lead to insufficient accumulation of these metabolites, and therefore the 

activity leading to MG synthesis would be very low. 

Egorova and co-workers (2007) developed a process to produce high amounts of MG 

using the trehalose deficient Thermus thermophilus RQ-1. The Thermus thermophilus 

mutant, grown in fed-batch fermentation, accumulated 0.31 µmol/mg protein of MG. 

This amount was raised up to 0.61 µmol/mg protein when the mutant was cultivated 

under osmotic stress (Egorova et al., 2007). Therefore, the MG production by the 

Thermus thermophilus mutant is 2.5-fold higher in comparison with S. cerevisiae 

engineered in our work. Despite this lower production, the strategy using recombinant 

S. cerevisiae has several advantages, such as: i) large-scale fermentation of yeast is 

well-established and thoroughly optimized; ii) S. cerevisiae grows at 30ºC while the 

growth temperature of Thermus thermophilus is 77ºC, which implies extra cost with 

energy consumption; iii) genetic manipulation of S. cerevisiae is straightforward and 

inexpensive, which makes this organism more suitable for further rounds of 

optimization.  

In view of the 2-fold increase in the production of MG when comparing strains VSY71 

and CEN.PK2 it would be worth screening a strain collection for other strains of S. 

cerevisiae that might be even better MG producers. Further strategies to improve MG 

production could involve the knock-out of pathways consuming GDP-mannose in an 

attempt to increase the pool of this substrate. Moreover, more effort should be invested 

in medium manipulation that is likely to result in considerable improvement in 

productivity.  

Compatible solutes are potentially useful in a broad range of applications, from 

biotechnology to medicine (Lentzen &amp;amp; Schwarz, 2006). In biotechnology their 

applicability goes from stabilization of proteins, like enzymes or vaccines, to the 

prevention of the aggregation of heterologous proteins when produced to high levels 

(Carrió et al., 2005; Schrödel &amp;amp; Marco, 2005).  

One of the applications derives from the protective effect of compatible solutes against  

protein misfolding and aggregation (Ross &amp;amp; Poirier, 2004). These characteristics make 

compatible solutes good candidates for lead compounds for the treatment of diseases 

associated with the unfolding of proteins, such as prion and amyloid-related illnesses 

(Ross &amp;amp; Poirier, 2004). In fact, several studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of 

these solutes in the formation of aggregated proteins. Ryu and co-workers (2008) 

studied the effect of MG, mannosylglyceramide, and glycerol on the aggregation of 

?-amyloid protein in mammalian cells. MG had a significant inhibitory effect on 



 
27 

?-amyloid formation and reduced the toxicity of amyloid aggregates in human 

neuroblastoma cells, while being innocuous to cells. In contrast, the other compounds 

showed no effect in the prevention of ?-amyloid formation. 

In another report, the role of four compatible solutes (MG, mannosylglyceramide, 

ectoine and hydroxyectoine) on the aggregation of the prion peptide was explored. In 

this case, MG and hydroxyectoine showed no effect in the prevention of the prion 

peptide aggregation. On the other hand, mannosylglyceramide and ectoine were able 

to inhibit the aggregation of this peptide and to decrease the prion peptide-induced 

toxicity in human neuroblastoma cells (Kanapathipillai et al., 2008). The authors 

suggested that the ability of solutes to prevent prion aggregation depends highly on 

their structure and it was inferred that the preferential binding properties of each solute 

could play a key role in the inhibition of aggregation. 

In the present work we propose the use of the MG-accumulating yeast as a model to 

study protein stabilization in living cells. For that, the S. cerevisiae strain VSY72, 

harboring two copies of ?-Syn-EGFP integrated in the genome, was engineered to 

synthesize MG (MG mutant). Remarkably, the accumulation of MG in the MG mutant 

led to a 3.5-fold decrease in the number of cells with ?-Syn inclusions in comparison 

with the Control mutant. Moreover, microscopy analysis of MG mutant cells showed 

bright fluorescence around the plasma membrane, suggesting that ?-Syn was re-

localized to the membrane. 

Moreover, we confirmed that ?-Syn over-production was accompanied by a 3-fold 

increase in the level of ROS; most importantly, this increase was clearly attenuated by 

the accumulation of MG in the cells. In healthy cells, the formation of unfolded and 

misfolded proteins is controlled by protein control systems that promote the refolding 

and repair of these proteins. When refold or repair is not possible, these aberrant 

proteins are marked and eliminated either by the ubiquitin proteasome system or by the 

autophagy-lysosome pathway (Haliwell, 2006). The over-production of ?-Syn seems to 

overload the capacity of the protein control systems, which raises the magnitude of the 

oxidative stress imposed to cells, consequently leading to accumulation of ROS. The 

observation that the level of ROS decreased in the MG mutant supports the view that 

MG alleviates the oxidative burden associated with ?-Syn over-production, most 

probably by shifting the equilibrium towards ?-Syn forms that are less toxic than 

oligomers or even mature aggregates.      

 It is important to note that there is a controversy about whether ?-Syn production in 

yeast cells results in the formation of fibrils. It has been reported that ?-Syn aggregates 

stained positive with thioflavin-S, proving that they had an amyloid-like structure 

(Zabrocki et al., 2005). More recently, on the basis of electron microscopy studies, it 



 
28 

was argued that ?-Syn accumulations do not contain fibril structures, but solely clusters 

of vesicles (Soper et al., 2008). In this work, we did not characterize the type of 

structures within the bright spots, but since we used the same strain as Zabrocki et al., 

(2005), it is reasonable to assume that at least some of the aggregates are amyloid-like 

structures.  

Besides the ability of MG to prevent the formation of ?-Syn inclusions, we also 

demonstrated that MG was able to promote the solubilization of these inclusions. This 

unexpected result revealed a new role for this compatible solute beyond protein 

stabilization. In fact, our work indicates that MG acts as a molecular chaperone since it 

effectively disrupts ?-Syn inclusions, probably promoting the release of native forms of 

?-Syn. The role of MG in the prevention / disruption of ?-Syn inclusions can derive from 

three different modes of action: 1) MG may induce cell mechanisms namely, 

proteasome and autophagy, which actively degrade misfolded ?-Syn; 2) MG may 

induce or activate chaperones that promote the correct folding of ?-Syn; 3) MG may 

directly stabilize the structure of ?-Syn preventing the formation of aggregates, similarly 

to what happens in in vitro assays of protein stabilization.  

Since western analysis showed that both mutants (Control and MG mutant) had similar 

levels of ?-Syn, probably the MG effect is not due to the induction of cell mechanisms 

that degraded ?-Syn. To check the second hypothesis, it would be interesting to 

compare the transcriptional profiles of the MG mutant and the Control mutant to have a 

global picture of the impact of MG at the transcriptional level. For example, if MG 

induces chaperone expression it is possible that the effect could be noted by the DNA-

microarray methodology. The data available do not allow us to draw a final conclusion, 

but it is possible that the mode of action of MG involves a direct effect, either by binding 

to specific regions of the protein or protein-oligomers, or indirectly by changes in the 

structure/dynamics of the protein hydration shell.   

 

Concluding remarks 

We constructed a strain of S. cerevisiae that produced 2-fold higher amounts of MG 

than the strain earlier described. Moreover, the specific production was similar to that 

of the best natural producer, Rhodothermus marinus. This is an encouraging result, 

especially if we take into account that, unlike R. marinus, S. cerevisiae can be 

fermented to very high cell densities. Although much work needs to be done to achieve 

the final goal of producing MG at a competitive cost, this is already an important 

achievement that should be followed in further optimization rounds. 

We designed an elegant strategy to demonstrate the efficacy of MG in the protection of 

proteins in living cells. MG was able to prevent the aggregation of ?-Syn and thereby 



 
29 

decrease its toxicity (reduction of ROS level). Moreover, it was shown, for the first time, 

that MG acts as a molecular chaperone by effectively accelerating the disruption of 

?-Syn inclusions. The yeast model developed in this work can be easily extended to 

test the effect of MG in the protection of other proteins, thereby verifying whether MG 

can be used as a general protein protector.

Appendix  
 

 

We were interested in assessing the effect of mannosyl-di-myo-inositol phosphate 

(MDIP) on the protection of model proteins against heat-induced denaturation, 

aggregation and inactivation. So far, MDIP has only been found in hyperthermophilic 

bacteria of the genera Thermotoga and Aquifex (Santos et al., 2007): in Aquifex spp., 

MDIP accumulates in response to osmotic stress, whereas it contributes to the heat 

stress response in Thermotoga spp.  

In order to determine the growth conditions that lead to maximum accumulation of 

MDIP in T. maritima, this hyperthermophile was grown at different temperatures (80ºC 

and 85ºC) and the cultures were harvested at different growth phases (mid- and late-

exponential phases). For each growth condition, ethanolic-chloroformic extractions 

were performed as described in Material and Methods.  

 

 

FIGURE 12 - Effect of the growth temperature on the accumulation of di-myo-inositol phosphate 

(DIP) and mannosyl-di-myo-inositol phosphate (MDIP) in Thermotoga maritima at mid- and 

late-exponential growth phases.  

 



 
37 

The pool of compatible solutes (DIP and MDIP) was quantified by 
31

P-NMR. The 

highest MDIP accumulation was observed when cells were grown at a temperature of 

85ºC and harvested during the mid-exponential phase (Fig. 12). 

Subsequently, the T. maritima was grown in a 300 L fermentor at 85ºC, and the 

compatible solutes were extracted from the biomass by using ethanol-chloroform 

extraction. The extract was loaded onto a QAE-Sephadex A25 column previously 

equilibrated with 5.0 mM sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.8. The elution was performed with 

one bed volume of the same buffer, followed by a linear gradient of 5.0 mM to 1 M 

sodium bicarbonate at a flow rate of 4 ml.min
-1
. The fractions eluted were analyzed by 

31
P-NMR to monitor the presence of MDIP. Two fractions were obtained: the first 

fraction contained pure MDIP was eluted at 100 mM sodium bicarbonate, while the 

second fraction was eluted at 200 mM sodium bicarbonate and contained a mixture of 

DIP plus MDIP. Unfortunately, the amount of pure MDIP obtained after the purification 

process was not sufficient to examine the effect of MDIP on the thermal stabilization of 

model proteins.
