fishery-dependent samples of Rioraja agassizi

(Chondrichthyes: Rajidae), off Santos, Southeast Brazil

M. Cristina Oddone*, Alberto F. de Amorim**, Patrícia L. Mancini*** and Walter Norbis****

Specimens of Rioraja agassizi were collected monthly off Santos, Southeast Brazil, between latitudes 23°37’S and 27°40’S,
from March, 2005 to March, 2006. A total number of 278 males and 1023 females were captured. Observed depth range was 10-
120 m, being the species absent above 120 m. Sex ratio significantly favored females. The entire length range of R. agassizi was
observed. Females ranged in length from 16.0 to 59.4 cm and males from 13.0 to 47.2 cm. Mean female length was significantly
higher than that of males. For grouped length distributions, asymmetry patterns were observed in both sexes. Length-width
functions were sexually dimorphic. Males with lengths &amp;lt;24.5 cm were relatively wider than females. Length-total weight curves
were significantly different than length-gutted weight ones, in both sexes. Females were heavier than males for a given TL
class. The angular coefficient b was significantly&amp;lt;3 (negative allometry) in the males, and also for the females with exception
of spring when b was &gt;3 (positive allometry). The monthly variation of the condition factor showed significant differences in
both sexes.

Espécimes de Rioraja agassizi foram mensalmente coletados em águas ao largo de Santos, sudeste do Brasil entre as latitudes
23°37’S e 27°40’S, desde março de 2005 até março de 2006. Um total de 278 machos e 1023 fêmeas foi capturado. A amplitude de
profundidade de ocorrência foi 10-120 m, estando a espécie ausente em profundidades &gt;120 m. A razão sexual favoreceu as
fêmeas. A amplitude completa de comprimentos de R. agassizi esteve representada e oscilou nas fêmeas entre 16.0-59.4 cm
comprimento e nos machos entre 13.0-47.2 cm. O tamanho médio das fêmeas foi significativamente maior do que dos machos.
A distribuição de freqüência de comprimentos por amostras agrupadas foi assimétrica em ambos os sexos. As curvas da
relação comprimento-largura foram sexualmente dimórficas. As fêmeas foram mais largas que os machos em todas as classes de
comprimento maiores do que 25 cm. As curvas comprimento-peso total foram significativamente diferentes das curvas
comprimento-peso eviscerado em ambos os sexos. As fêmeas foram mais pesadas do que os machos para uma determinada
classe de comprimento. O coeficiente angular b foi&amp;lt;3 nos machos (alometría negativa) e nas fêmeas, mas com exceção da
primavera, onde a alometría foi positiva (b&gt;3). O fator de condição variou significativamente ao longo do ano em ambos os
sexos.

Introduction

Skates (Rajidae) are widely distributed from Artic to

Antarctic waters and from coastal to ~3000 m deep, being rare

in tropical waters especially in coral reefs (McEachran &amp;amp;

Notabartolo di Sciara, 1995) and absent from the Pacific Plate

and Red Sea (Springer 1982 apud Last &amp;amp;Yearsley, 2002). The

genus Rioraja Whitley, 1939, has a single species, the ‘rio

skate’ Rioraja agassizi (Müller &amp;amp; Henle, 1841), commonly

known in Brazil as ‘raia-santa’. The absence of a caudal fin is

a distinct character of this species (Figueiredo, 1977).

From a biogeographic perspective, R. agassizi belongs to

the pattern of species endemic to the austral region of South

America, being, along with the genus Atlantoraja, limited to

the south-western region of the Atlantic Ocean (McEachran

&amp;amp; Miyake, 1990; McEachran &amp;amp; Aschliman, 2004; Compagno,

2005). The species ranges from Espírito Santo State (Brazil) to

Argentina, inhabiting coastal waters from the shore down to

130 m (Figueiredo, 1977).

Despite the uniform-brown coloration, there are two darker

oval ocelli with a light or dark center, in the inner area of the

pectoral fins, being highly variable in shape and with a lighter

ring around them. In some individuals, this circle is surrounded

by a single row of minute white points. Throughout the dorsal

face of the skate, little, circular; white and symmetrically placed

spots can occur, even in the pelvic fins area, in adult as well as

young (Figueiredo, 1977; Barbosa &amp;amp; Gomes, 1998; Oddone, pers.

obs.). The white ventral surface with white and light pink tones

allows it to be distinguished from young Atlantoraja platana

with which at first sight it could be mistaken. Light ventral

colouration in R. agassizi is typical of species that inhabit shal-

low waters (McEachran &amp;amp; Notabartolo di Sciara, 1995).

Male R. agassizi attains sexual maturity at 32 cm and fe-

males at 40 cm of total length (Oddone et al., 2007). Rioraja

agassizi is a benthic feeder, preying mainly on Crustacea,

especially Amphipoda, Caridea and Brachyura and Teleostei

(Muto et al., 2001).

Skates, as other elasmobranches, are long-lived, attain

sexual maturity at large size and have low fecundity and long

development period. These features make them susceptible

to overexploitation (Walker, 1999). Casarini (2006) estimated

the longevity of R. agassizi to be as 20 and 23 years respec-

tively for males and females. It is important for management

purposes to know where the center of the stock is and if it is

subject to seasonal variation (Walker, 1999). In Southeast

Brazil, only the large individuals of R. agassizi are landed and

exported (Casarini, 2006).

The aim of this work was to describe the latitudinal and

bathymetric distribution of R. agassizi in the fishing area of

Santos and Guarujá’s fishing fleet (southeast Brazil); to analyze

the frequency composition of total length for both sexes and

the relationships between total length and total width, and

total and gutted weight; to establish the type of growth in

weight with total length (allometry/isometry); and finally to

determine the condition factor throughout a year.

Materials and Methods

Samples of Rioraja agassizi were obtained through a part-

nership system with fishermen as it is mostly a non commer-

cialized species (Casarini, 1999). A total of eight fishing ves-

sels (trawler and paired trawler), took part in the survey, bring-

ing regularly (once or twice a month) samples of this species.

Vessels’ length over all ranged from 19.5 to 22.5 m and beam

from 5.3 to 13 m m. The stretched mesh of the trawlnet varied

from 45 to 90 mm and the groundrope ranged from 22 to 70 m.

Whenever possible, skippers identified the sample bag

with a number corresponding with a trawling position, along

with it characteristics, recorded on a board map. Data col-

lected for each trawl were: date, depth, latitude/longitude,

number of hauls and number of hauls with occurrence of the

species. As the presence/absence of the species per haul

was not regularly recorded, and since when recorded the in-

formation was imprecise, it was assumed that such data is

unknown.

Study area was located between latitudes 23°37’S and

27°40’S, including States of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Paraná

and Santa Catarina, at depths between 10 to 146 m (Fig. 1).

Samples were collected monthly from March, 2005 to March,

2006 (Table 1).

Biometric measurements were: total length (TL, cm), total

width (DW, cm), total weight (T
W

, g) and gutted weight (body

weight without digestive tract, liver and gonads and oviduct

for the females, Gw, g).  Linear measurements were made with

0.1 cm precision. Electronic scales used had 1 and 5 g preci-

sion respectively.

The Condition Factor (CF) was calculated monthly ac-

cording to King (1995): CF
T
=Tw/TLb and CF

G
=Gw/TLb, where

the sub-indexes T and G are the total and gutted weight,

respectively, b is the angular coefficient of the potential curve

adjusted to the relationship  TL-Tw and TL-Gw.

The use of parametric/non-parametric tests was chosen

by testing the normality and homogeneity of the variables’

variance by Lilliefors’ and Levene’s tests respectively. To

compare TL-Tw/Gw curves, data were log-transformed to

become linear and the F-test was used (Souza, 1998). Sex

ratios were tested using 2. To assess the nature of the growth

in weight with TL (isometry, allometry, etc.), the value of the

angular coefficient b was compared with the theoretical value

of 3. For this purpose, monthly samples of males and females

were grouped by season, that is, summer (January, February,

March), autumn (April, May, June), winter (July, August, Sep-

tember) and spring (October, November, December). Compari-

sons among CF obtained for all individuals by month, were

performed using Kruskal-Wallis’ H-test and post-hoc Mann-

using the freeware packet PAST (Hammer et al., 2001). In all

cases the significance level considered was 0.05.

Results

A total number of 278 males and 1023 females of R. agassizi

were collected in 25 fishing trips, carried out from March, 2005 to

March, 2006 by 8 fishing vessels of Guaruja’s fishing fleet. The

species was captured monthly, during the entire period. Ob-

served depth range was 10-120, being absent below 120 m (Table

1). Descriptive statistics for the monthly R. agassizi samples by

sex are presented in Table 2. In the area covered by the vessels,

the species occurred throughout the year (Fig. 2).

Sex ratio (M:F) for the samples was 1:3.7, significantly

different from the 1:1 ratio throughout the year, varying from

1:1.19 (July) and 1:5.9 (March 2005), in all cases significantly

favoring the females (p&gt;0.000, Table 2).

Considering grouped samples, the entire TL range of R.

agassizi was observed. Females ranged in TL from 16.0 to

59.4 cm (n=1019; mean=46.9; SD=4.4) and males from 13.0 to

47.2 cm (n=278; mean=38.8; SD=3.4). Females were signifi-

cantly larger than males (t=-28.5; d. f. =1295; p&lt;0), and such

pattern was maintained monthly. The difference in mean TL

for males and females in presented in Table 2. For grouped TL

distributions, asymmetry patterns were observed in both

sexes, with asymmetry values different from 0 (Table 2), vary-

ing from –1.8 to –1.3 for males and females, respectively (Fig.

3). The asymmetry pattern remained when monthly samples

were considered, though varying between positive and nega-

tive values. In the males, positive asymmetry was observed in

May, June, October, November, December and March of 2006,

whereas only in December for females. Mean TL varied between

43.4 (February) and 53.0 (October) for the females and between

36.7 (March) and 41.2 (May) for the males (Table 2).

Total length/TW functions for R. agassizi were

significantly different for both sexes (F
(2,1291)

=75.2; p&lt;0.005)

(Table 3). Males were wider than females for TL&amp;lt;24.5 cm

(TW=17.4 cm). From that size up, females become wider than

males for all TL classes (Fig. 4). Total length-Tw potential

curves were significantly different than TL-Gw curves (Table

3, Fig. 5) in females (F
(2,1002)

=53.6; p=0.000) and males

(F
(2,533)

=80.3; p=0.000).  Females were heavier than males for a

given TL class, considering both Tw and Gw (F
(2,1279)

=75.2;

p=0.000; F
(2,1132)

=580; p=0.000, respectively). In Table 4, mean

values for Tw and Gw by month and sex along with the

respective TL range are presented.

Males grew in weight in a negative allometric manner with

TL (b&lt;3), when considering Tw as well as Gw, in the four

seasons. The females, however, followed the same pattern of

negative allometry, with exception of spring when their growth

was positively allometric (b&gt;3) (Table 5).

For the males, July was not included in the calculation of

CF when considering Tw, and when considering Gw, June

and July were not considered, because in those months the

small sample led to outlier values for the angular coefficient

b. This was due to the fact that only males with large TL

values occurred, and because of the absence of juveniles in

the samples, the potential curve was not properly adjusted.

Kruskal-Wallis’ test detected significant differences in the

CF throughout the year, when considering Tw (H
(11, N= 277)

=267.66, p=0.0000)) and Gw (H
(10, N=260)

=245.3, p=0.0000). The

overall median CF’s value for Tw was 0.028. Post hoc pairwise

comparisons were significant (P&lt;0.05) between all the months

with exception of: January-March/2006; December-March/2006;

December-January; October-February; September-March/2006;

September-January; September-December; June-August and

April-February. For Gw, monthly differences between CF were

mostly significant and were not significant for the pairs: Janu-

ary-March/2006; November/March; November-December; Sep-

tember-December; August-MNarch/2006; August-November;

April-March/2006; April-February; April-January; April-Decem-

ber; April-October; April-September; March-March/2006; De-

cember-March/2006 and April-March/2006.

For the females, the CF significantly varied throughout

the year, when considering both Tw and Gw (H
(12, N=1007)

=954.6,

p=0.0000 and H
(12, N=939)

= 840.0, p=0.0000, respectively).  The

overall median CF value for Tw was 0.0074. Post hoc pairwise

comparisons were significant (P&lt;0.05) between all the months

with exception of:  February-March/2006; Ocotber-March/

2006; October-February; May-December and March-

November. Overall CF with Gw median’s value was 0.016, with

significant differences between all the month pairs (P&lt;0.05),

with exception of: February-March/2006; April-July; March-

March/2006 and March-February (Fig. 6, Table 4).

Discussion

Information on habitat use in elasmobranchs is important

not only with specific objectives such as determination of

nursery area, but also for management purposes and species

conservation. During the past decade, studies on habitat use

have increased specially for commercially fished species and

extracted by-catch, as is the case for the rajids (Simpfendorfer

&amp;amp; Heupel, 2004).

Fisheries have negatively affected rajid fishes, in part be-

cause of their mostly sedentary nature even to the point of ex-

tinction, rendering many species in a critical situation (Brander,

1981; Casey &amp;amp; Myers, 1998; Dulvy &amp;amp; Reynolds, 2002).

For fishery-dependent samples, it is not possible to obtain

a reliable estimation of CPUE because we have only access to

a ‘fleeting image’ of the real population (Walker, 1999), which

is especially true for this work. This is due to the contradic-

tory and low quality and reliability of the information pro-

vided by the skippers regarding the magnitude of total catch

and discard. However, because of the monthly presence of R.

agassizi in the samples, it is assumed that it is present in the

area throughout the year without variation in its abundance.

Reinforcing this hypothesis, Ponz Louro (1995) observed that

after Psammobatis glandissimilis, R. agassizi is the most abun-

dant rajid in Ubatuba, São Paulo State, and Figueiredo (1977)

had already considered the species as ‘common’ in the same

area.  For the Uruguayan inner shelf, R. agassizi together with

Atlantoraja castelanui and A. cyclophora were distributed in

30-60% of the area with abundances between 1000 and 5000 kg/

square nautical mile (Paesch, 2006).

Most skate species have a limited, well-defined distribu-

tion, and there are very few ranging species (Walker, 1999). It

is known that R. agassizi ranges from Argentina to Rio de

Janeiro (Brazil) (Figueiredo, 1977). Though precise limits of

its distribution remain unknown to date, R. agassizi is prob-

ably distributed continuously along the cited range, because

it is recorded in southeast and south Brazil, Uruguay and

Argentina (Figueiredo, 1977; Menni &amp;amp; Lopez, 1984; Vooren,

1998; Meneses &amp;amp; Paesch, 2003).

With regard to depth of occurrence, Menni &amp;amp; Lopez (1984)

classified R. agassizi as belonging to the ‘inner shelf mixed

fauna’ fish group (Menni &amp;amp; Gosztonyi, 1982). McEachran &amp;amp;

Miyake (1990) stated that R. agassizi occurred at depths down

to ~50 m. However, in this study, R. agassizi was recorded at

maximum depths of 120 m and Menni &amp;amp; Lopez (1984) stated

its depth range was from 22 to 89 m. For the south Brazilian

area, Vooren (1998) confirmed its presence at depth of 20-50

m, in agreement with Compagno (2005) who considers this

species as demersal in the shelf of it distribution range. For

Vooren op.cit., R. agassizi is a species of constant presence

in south Brazil, which completes it cycle  entirely in these

waters without seasonal variations in its abundance, being

one of the 27 elasmobranch species recorded in the South

Brazilian shelf (Vooren &amp;amp; Klippel., 2005). Menni et al. (1981)

recorded the southernmost limit for this species in the Golfo

de San Matías (Argentina, at 41°30’), where it is fished at up

to 181 m deep, while Figueiredo (1977) considered that the

species occurred at a maximum depth of 130 m in southwest

Brazil. In Ubatuba, São Paulo’s State’s littoral area, R. agassizi

occurs only in the coastal area at down to 50 m, with similar

proportions of males and females during the whole year (Ponz

Louro, 1995). Casarini (2006) observed that R. agassizi was

the most abundant species in the depth range of 10-50 m in

southeast Brazil.

Sexual segregation was not observed in this work and sex

ratio favored the females. The same was observed by Casarini

(2006) for the same species in the same area. However, uni-

sexual aggregations of Raja clavata were recorded off the

coast of East Anglia by Holden (1975), and could be common

for rajids (Steven, 1933). For the southwestern Atlantic,

Sympterygia acuta, S. bonapartii and Atlantoraja

cyclophora do not segregate by sexes (De Queiroz, 1986;

Oddone &amp;amp; Vooren, 2004, 2005). Ebert (2005) studied eight

Bathyraja species, recording no sexual segregation in six of

them and a sex ratio favoring males in only two, along the

eastern Bering Sea continental slope.

Data on the distribution of sizes in the catch can indi-

cates a population’s status or the risk of overfishing, as too

Size composition, monthly condition factor and morphometrics of Rioraja agassizi422

small fish may mean not enough are managing to spawn

(Hilborn &amp;amp; Walters, 1992). The same authors stated that young

fish are less vulnerable to fishing gears than older ones. How-

ever, Oddone (unpublished data) recorded the presence of

young and even neonates of R. agassizi and Atlantoraja

spp., a fact that to date seemed to be unusual in rajids and

that reflects the vulnerability of these life stages to bottom

trawl fisheries. For the South Brazilian shelf Vooren &amp;amp; Klippel

(2005) did not record neonates of R. agassizi, at depths of 7-

20 m. Patterns of negative asymmetry in TL distributions,

indicate that both for males and females, more specimens

occurred with high values of TL and a few with low values of

TL. A positive pattern of asymmetry would indicate just the

opposite.

Negative asymmetric distribution of frequencies of TL for

both sexes were observed in Atlantoraja cyclophora (Oddone

&amp;amp; Vooren, 2004).

The largest specimen of R. agassizi recorded by Figuei-

redo (1977) was a 49 cm  adult male. In this work the largest

sizes observed were 59.4 cm for the females and 47.2 cm for

the males, confirming the sexual dimorphism in size. In sharks,

females attain maximum size and older age than males (Cortés,

2000). Several Rajidae are sexually dimorphic too, regarding

size (Jardas, 1973; Nottage &amp;amp; Perkins, 1983; Oddone &amp;amp; Vooren,

2004). Exceptionally, Ebert (2005) observed that in Bathyraja

interrupta, B. minispinosa and B. parmifera, males attained

a larger size than females, while in B. lindbergi, B. maculata

and B. trachura  both sexes grew to approximately the same

size, observing that only in B. aleutica and B. taranetzi did

females achieve noticeably larger sizes than males. Cousseau

et al. (2000) in Argentinean waters recorded contrasting maxi-

mum TLs of 61.8 cm for a male and 70.8 cm for a female of R.

agassizi. This suggests a size gradient in the TL for R. agassizi,

which increases southward, and which was already noted in

teleost fishes (Wootton, 1996).

Sexually dimorphic length-weight relationships, were

observed in A. cyclophora (total and gutted weight),

Psammobatis normani, P. extenta and S. bonapartii (Braccini

&amp;amp; Chiaramonte, 2002; Mabragaña et al., 2002; Oddone &amp;amp;

Vooren, 2004; Mabragaña &amp;amp; Cousseau, 2004), though Raja

miraletus showed an opposite pattern (Ungaro, 2004). In this

work, it was observed that throughout the year, males and

females grew with negative allometry with TL, with exception

of spring when females followed a pattern of positive allom-

etry. This could be due more to food availability in spring in

the area than to reproduction, as in this species vitellogen-

esis, ovulation and egg-laying occur throughout the year

(Oddone et al., 2007). Possible effect of stomach contents on

the weight of the skates were avoided by calculating b with

gutted weight, so differences in body weight may well reflect

differences in body condition.

The correlation coefficient of the ratio TL-Gw was par-

ticularly lower in the males (0.767). This would indicate that,

in spite of the fact that such correlation was significant for

the potential curve adjusted, a trend in the Gw to increase

more slowly with total length exists, when compared with Tw,

for a given TL value. This fact was not evident in the females

and could then be related to the sexual dimorphism in the

body shape that is observed in rajid species, i.e., males present

a striking concavity in the anterior part of the disc, from the

snout to the tip of the pectoral fins, which is not observed in

the females. When considering Tw, such trend is likewise

masked by the effect of the viscera and especially stomach

content, reflecting a more typical potential curve pattern be-

cause of the higher value of the angular coefficient b.

In summer, b was estimated to be 2.984 and 2.888 for total

and gutted weight respectively. Although these values were

statistically different from 3, the sample number (71) may be

considered, because the larger the sample size, the more the

significance of the differences, and therefore for this season

growth could have been isometric as well. Braccini &amp;amp;

Chiaramonte (2002) recorded isometric growth for males and

positive allometric growth in females of P. extenta.

The condition factor can provide information on the gen-

eral condition of fishes in the habitat they live, as well as

indicate phenomena such as spawning period, alterations in

population density and feeding conditions (Braga, 1986). In

R. agassizi, CF varied significantly throughout the year, re-

flecting variations in the availability of food and mainly in the

Fig. 6. Median condition factor by month (from March, 2005

to March, 2006) considering total (black line) and gutted weight

(g) (grey line) for males (above) and females (below) of Rioraja

reproductive events, such as egg-laying, vitellogenesis and

production of the egg cases.  Seasonal variation of the diet

seems to be associated with the availability of the prey, whose

distribution and abundance are related to the dynamics of

the water masses of the region (Muto et al., 2001). Loefer &amp;amp;

Sedberry (2003) observed that in Rhizoprionodon

terraenovae the condition factor in both sexes was low dur-

ing the mating season, an indication of probable stress.

The CF may also be influenced by the liver weight’s varia-

tion throughout the year, as the liver is strongly correlated

with reproduction in rajids (Oddone &amp;amp; Velasco, 2006) and elas-

mobranchs in general. Sexual dimorphism in the liver weight

was noted already in several rajid species, and this is related to

the energy expenditure of females during vitellogenesis, oo-

cyte maturation and gestation. Females store great quantities

of lipids in the liver during the pre-vitellogenic phase of the

reproductive cycle (Lucifora et al., 2002), and the production

of vitellogenin (the precursor to egg yolk proteins), takes place

in the liver (Gelsleichter, 2004). In Raja asterias, for instance,

an increase in the gonad weight is accompanied by the storage

of substances in the liver (Capapé, 1980). In males of this spe-

cies, two well defined annual peaks in the gonadosomatic in-

dex exist, while in the females of R. agassizi and others such as

A. cyclophora (Oddone &amp;amp; Vooren, 2005), such peaks are not

that evident, confirming the absence of seasonality in the re-

productive variables, such as gonad weight, egg-laying fre-

quency throughout the year, etc. This observation may well

explain the rather greater variation for males in the CF (with

regard to Gw), by the end of the year (December) when com-

pared with females.

A growth pattern where males are wider than females in the

first life stages, turning the females wider than males from a given

TL, may be typical of at least some rajids and was also observed in

A. cyclophora (Oddone, 2003; Oddone &amp;amp; Vooren, 2004).
