ABSTRACT 

A model of heat and mass transfer is proposed in order to predict frost formation into a closed 

container filled with frozen vegetables. The physical problem is modeled as a macroporous 

media composed by the product itself and the surrounding air. Natural convection air flow is 

assumed into the container, who promotes water mass transport. As a first validation, the 

model is simulated for several exterior air temperatures, under environmental fluctuations 

(boundary conditions). Results of four temperature cycles were compared, varying average air 

temperature, amplitude and frequency of oscillation, one by one. As a general result, it is 

observed that the product temperature behavior is as expected, and it is directly associated 

with frost formation into the container. Frost formation increases with large amplitude of 

oscillation, but decreases with higher frequencies and higher mean temperatures. Model 

parameters were obtained for two assembling: frozen slices of carrots and air, and frozen extra 

thin green beans and air. Parameter definition and evaluation combines literature review, 

measurements and numerical simulation. In general, parameters which characterize these 

porous media were similar for both products, even though they display different geometries. 

The experimental validation is performed for carrot slices with two temperature cycles. The 

numerical model is able to predict air velocity field, air and product temperatures, and local 

frost formation. Results are validated in respect to a set of independent experimental results 

that shown a good agreement. Air flow circulation is as expected due to natural convection. 

Product temperature simulated behavior agrees with measurements, and temperature values 

differ by less than 12%. Respect to frost formation predictions, the model predicts correctly 

the most susceptible regions to frost formation. However, the quantity of frost formed 

predicted by the model (           ) is lower than the experimental one (          ), 

despite being of the same order of magnitude. The effect of each parameter in the model is 

study in order to detect how to improve the model. The most important parameters affecting 

total frost formation are effective mass diffusivity and convective heat coefficient into the 

storage container. Adjusting these parameters to twice, better results in terms of frost 

formation could be obtained (           ).

RESUMO 

Este trabalho propõe um modelo de transferência de calor e massa para prever a formação de 

gelo em um container preenchido com legumes congelados. O problema físico é modelado 

como um meio poroso composto pelo próprio produto e o ar em seu entorno. O regime de 

convecção natural é assumido dentro do container, o qual promove o transporte de massa. 

Como uma primeira validação, o modelo é simulado considerando diferentes temperaturas de 

ar externo, causadas por flutuações da vizinhança. Resultados para quatro ciclos de 

temperaturas foram comparados, variando separadamente a temperatura média do ar, 

amplitude e frequência de oscilação. De modo geral, é observado que a temperatura do 

produto se comporta assim como era esperado e este resultado é diretamente associado à 

formação de gelo dentro do container. A formação de gelo cresce com uma maior amplitude 

de oscilação, porém decresce com um aumento na frequência e na temperatura média. Os 

parâmetros do modelo foram obtidos para dois diferentes produtos: fatias de cenouras 

congeladas e vagens congeladas, ambos em meio ao ar. As definições de parâmetros são 

oriundas de revisão bibliográfica, medições experimentais e simulações numéricas. Os 

parâmetros encontrados para a caracterização desses meios porosos foram similares para 

ambos os produtos, mesmo eles possuindo diferentes geometrias. A validação experimental 

foi feita para as fatias de cenoura considerando dois ciclos de temperatura. O modelo 

numérico é capaz de prever o campo de velocidades do ar, as temperaturas do produto e a 

formação de gelo local. Os resultados foram validados em relação a um grupo independente 

de resultados numéricos, tal comparação apresentou uma boa concordância. A circulação de 

ar encontrada é, de fato, devido à convecção natural. O comportamento da temperatura dos 

produtos simulados concorda com os valores medidos e os valores de temperaturas diferem 

por menos de 12%. Com respeito à formação de gelo, o modelo é capaz de prevê-la 

corretamente nas regiões mais suscetíveis a este fenômeno. Porém, a quantidade de gelo 

formado prevista pelo modelo (1,56 g/semana) é menor do que a experimental (4,67 

g/semana), apesar de serem de mesma ordem de magnitude. O efeito de cada parâmetro no 

modelo é estudado visando detectar maneiras de aprimorar o modelo. Foi encontrado que os 

parâmetros mais importantes para a formação de gelo total são a difusividade de massa efetiva 

e o coeficiente de transferência de calor convectivo dentro do container. Ajustando estes 

parâmetros duas vezes foi possível encontrar resultados melhores com respeito à formação de 

gelo (3,09 g/semana).

1 INTRODUCTION 

1.1  Context 

Nowadays, there is a world scale effort towards the efficient use of energy and to 

reduce carbon emissions, by adapting consume behaviors to renewable energies limitations. 

The European project Horizon 2020
1
 states to obtaining “Secure, clean and efficiency energy” 

as one of its objectives. The European Union's objective is to increase the share of renewable 

energies in energy matrix from 8% in 2014 to 20% in 2020. In this context, the French Agence 

de l'Environnement et de la Maitrise de l'Energie (ADEME) offers financial benefits for 

industrial consumers that are capable of disconnecting from the energy network. In the other 

hand, consumers must be able to adapt then to a more flexible energy matrix, based on 

different sources, like solar or wind. When it concerns the food industry, that procedure may 

respect a compromise, since energy disconnection leads to temperature fluctuation into the 

storage environment, affecting directly product quality, which is an important restriction. 

In frozen food industry, products, and in the particular case of vegetables, are stored at 

low temperature in cold rooms, packed in box pallets covered with a plastic bag. Storage 

duration can range from few months up to one year, before being transfer to small packages, 

in order to be commercialized. During long term storage into cold rooms, frozen products are 

exposed to air temperature fluctuations that impact product quality, like ice recrystallization, 

dehydration, frost formation, etc. Therefore, losses can be expected due to the quality of 

temperature management. 

Flexifroid
2
 project, financed by ADEME and carried out by the Institut National de 

Recherché en Sciences et Technologies pour l'Environnement et l'Agriculture (IRSTEA) of 

France and by the frozen food company Bonduelle S.A., wants to answer two questions:  

- Which is the impact of longer or shorter-term periods of energy 

disconnection on product quality?  

- Does energy disconnection cause a final overconsumption? In which 

circumstances?

In this way, the aim of the project is to develop a model to optimize the refrigeration 

system operation and to predict product quality in different conditions. Results are seen as a 

tool for industry and they can, eventually, help to decide on the disconnection of the power 

supply network. 

In order to understand the behavior of bulk storage of frozen vegetables, and to avoid 

quality losses, it is necessary to analyze multiphysical phenomena involved inside a pallet 

box, such as heat transfer, airflow, and frost formation.  

Slices of frozen vegetables and the air trapped inside can be modeled as a porous 

media. That macroporous domain is submitted to temperature fluctuations of the external air, 

caused by the operation of the storage facility refrigerating system. Heat transfer, airflow by 

natural convection, and mass transport lead to product dehydration and frost formation inside 

the pallet. 

Unsteady heating and cooling induced by exterior air fluctuations may produce a non-

uniform field of proprieties on the pallet box. Close to external walls, products and air 

temperature would react or respond more rapidly than in the middle of the pallet, due to 

thermal inertia. Water from the warmer product is sublimated from hotter regions and then is 

deposited and frozen at the surface of cooler product regions, where temperature is lower than 

the air dew temperature, and frost formation takes place. As a result, product dehydration and 

frost formation are the major quality losses to be avoided, generating changes in product 

appearance, color, texture and taste. Moreover, frost deposition generates “blocks” of product-

frost. 

A literature review on airflow, heat transfer and frost formation in frozen porous 

media is presented. 

1.2  Literature review 

1.2.1 Transport phenomena in macroporous media 

Macroporous media are defined as the porous media in which the ratio of container 

diameter to particle diameter is smaller than 10. Under these conditions, the effect of the 

container walls and airflow entrance region cannot be neglected [Alvarez et al., 2003, Amara 

et al., 2004 and Verboven et al., 2006]. There are several studies supporting the use of heat 

and mass transfer models for a porous media, applied to a bulk of food products (macroporous 



3 
 

 
 

media). A possible approach is direct CFD simulation, which consist on numerically solving 

the Navier-Stokes and local energy and mass transfer equations [Verboven et al., 2006 and 

Laguerre et al., 2008]. This method is limited as it requires large computational hardware 

[Laguerre et al., 2008]. Alternatively, good results are obtained by the porous media 

approach, based on space average velocity (Darcy velocity) and different methods developed 

for the energy equation, with one and two temperatures models [Rohsenow, 1998]. 

1.2.1.1  Natural convection in macroporous media 

Some of these works were focused on transport phenomena in porous media under 

natural convection conditions. In this case, a buoyancy term is add to Darcy equation 

(momentum equation), coupled to the energy equation. Laguerre et al., 2008, studied transient 

heat transfer by free convection in a packed bed of spheres. They developed a packed bed 

approach and compared it to direct CFD simulation. They concluded that both approaches 

were in good agreement with experimental values of product and air temperatures. However, 

the CFD approach was harder to mesh and required more computational time, but it was able 

to predict fluid flow and temperature in details. Beukema et al., 1982, developed a two 

dimensional two phase model of temperature and moisture distribution during cooling and 

storage of fresh agricultural products in cylindrical containers, under natural convection. 

Model results showed good agreement with experimental measures for potatoes. Dona and 

Sewart Jr, 1988, applied the porous media approach to solved numerically natural convection 

heat transfer inside a cylindrical grain bin filled with stored corn. The effect of container 

aspect ratios was also analyzed.  

1.2.1.2  Temperature fluctuation effects in frozen products 

Constant temperature storage conditions in frozen food cold stores are very difficult to 

attain in practice. It is well known that product can display weight losses due to temperature 

fluctuation. As a consequence, sublimated water induces changes in food appearance, color, 

texture and taste [Poovarodom, Tocci and Mascheroni, 1995, and Campañone et al., 2001]. 

Studies have shown the effect of temperature fluctuations and temperature heterogeneity on 

the quality of the product. For example, Martins et al., 2004, studied the behavior of ascorbic 

acid, vitamin C, color and flavor on frozen green beans, and found that thermal fluctuations 

are detrimental at higher storage temperatures. 



4 
 

 
 

Numerous studies show that frozen food weight loss depend on several factors like 

freezing method, storage average temperature and amplitude of temperature fluctuation, 

relative humidity, packaging, etc. Pham et al., 1982, Pham and Willix, 1985, and Méndez 

Bustabad, 1999, studied experimentally the weight loss of lamb, beef and pork frozen 

carcasses. Phimolsiripol et al., 2011, worked with frozen bread dough into a polyethylene bag; 

they proposed a kinetic, physical and artificial neural network model and compared their 

results to experimental measures. Pham and Willix, 1984, developed simple equations to 

describe the ratio of desiccation of frozen food, taking into account the dehydrate layer. Pham, 

1987, presented equations and graphical methods to predict the maximum possible moisture 

change between product and air. Tocci and Mascheroni, 1995, proposed a heat and mass 

transfer model for frozen food storage, capable to predict product (spheres) weight loss, based 

on an explicit finite difference method. Campaño et al, 2005, proposed a numerical model 

solved with implicit finite difference method Campaño et al, 2001, and a simplified analytical 

model Campaño et al, 2005, for prediction of weight loss during freezing and storage of 

unpacked frozen food, taking into account the changes on the dehydrated layer in the product 

surface. All authors agreed in the fact that product weight loss increases at high temperatures, 

large amplitudes of fluctuations and low frequencies. They also stated that packaging may 

reduce product weight loss. However, none of them studied the posterior frost formation.  

1.2.1.3  Frost formation phenomena 

Most studies in this area are focused on frost formation in air coolers. In these 

conditions, frost layer thickness and density are key parameters, since they affect significantly 

the heat transfer rate and airflow through the fins. Some of these studies analyzed the effect of 

air relative humidity, air temperature and surface temperature [Cheng et al., 2001, Amini et 

al., 2014, Haijie et al., 2014, and Wu et al., 2016].  

As a result of this literature review, it was seen that there are few studies in frost 

formation in frozen food. Poovarodom studied experimentally the influence of temperature 

(averaged, amplitude and frequency of fluctuations) and the role of packing in the storage of 

frozen meat. She analyzes the product quality and frost formation into the package for 

different storage temperature, amplitudes and frequency of fluctuations. Laguerre and Flick, 

2007, studied frost formation on frozen products (packed bed of potato and melon balls) 

inside hermetic packages in domestic freezers.  They compared the results for four different 

insulation packages and two types of refrigerator (different frequency and amplitude of 



5 
 

 
 

temperature oscillations). They proposed a qualitative model to explain the phenomenon 

observed experimentally. Both studies [Poovarodom, Laguerre and Flick, 2007] concluded 

that frost formation is higher at high storage temperatures, large amplitudes of fluctuations 

and low frequencies.  Studies on the modeling of frost formation into a container with frozen 

product in conditions of natural convection were not found on the open literature.  

1.3  Objectives 

The main goal of this work consists on the prediction of frost formation of frozen 

product packed on a container submitted to temperature fluctuations under natural convection. 

Complementary objectives are: 

- Perform an experimental characterization of frost formation. 

- Modeling and simulation of heat and mass transfer of the packed frozen 

products. 

- Experimental validation of the model against measured data from 

temperature and frost in different regions of the product container, in two different 

temperature cycles. 

1.4  Structure 

The work is organized in five chapters. The first chapter, Introduction, presents a 

general review about frost formation in porous media. Modeling airflow, heat and mass 

transfer, and frost formation presents a review of theoretical foundations and literature 

review, about modeling airflow in porous media, heat and mass transfer in porous media and 

frozen food storage (dehydration and frost formation). A numerical model for a cylindrical 

container was proposed, implemented in the software CFD COMSOL and test for simple 

cases. Parameters identification presents materials and methods used to measure, calculate 

and identified parameters that characterized two porous media: slices of frozen carrots and 

frozen green beans. Experimental values were compared between them. Experimental 

validation presents materials and methods for the experimental validation and compares 

experimental measures and simulation results, for two temperature cycles, with slices of 

carrots. Temperature and frost formation were tested and a study of the influence of different 

parameters was done.

BULK STORAGE OF FROZEN VEGETABLES AS A MACROPOROUS 

MEDIA: AIRFLOW, HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER AND FROST 

FORMATION MODELING 

 

 

 

 

Abstract 

A model of heat and mass transfer is proposed in order to predict frost formation into a closed 

container filled with frozen vegetables. The physical problem is modeled as a macroporous 

media composed by the product itself and the surrounding air. Natural convection airflow is 

assumed into the container, who promotes water mass transport. The model is simulated for 

several exterior air temperatures, under environmental fluctuations (boundary conditions). 

Results of four temperature cycles were compared, varying average air temperature, 

amplitude and frequency of oscillation, one by one. As a general result, it is observed that the 

product temperature behavior is as expected, and it is directly associated with frost formation 

into the container. The bigger is the change on the product temperature, the bigger is the 

amount of frost formation. Frost formation increases with large amplitude of oscillation, but 

decreases with higher frequencies and higher mean temperatures. 

 

 

Key words: modeling heat and mass transfer; temperature fluctuation; natural convection; 

CFD simulation; frost formation.

1. Transport phenomena in porous media 

A porous medium is a material consisting on a fixed solid matrix with interconnected void 

spaces, called pores. The interconnection of pores allows fluid to flow through the material.  

Natural porous media is composed by particles of irregular sizes and shapes, so on pore scale 

(microscopic) flow quantities, like velocity and pressure, are irregular. A modeling approach 

is based on space averaged quantities (macroscopic), like permeability and equivalent 

conductivity, which simplify the description of the flow through the porous medium. 

The spatial average consists on assigning the average quantity value over a representative 

elementary volume, to the centroid of it, and the average fluid velocity over a volume element 

of the medium is defined as a superficial velocity or the Darcy velocity. 

The porosity   of a porous medium is defined as the fraction of the total volume       

     +       that is occupied by the fluid      , as follows: 

  
     

            
          (2.1) 

In an isotropic porous media, surface porosity is equal to volumetric porosity. In natural 

porous media, the porosity is in general smaller than 0.6. In the case of a bed of uniform 

spheres, porosity varies between 0.2595 and 0.4764 [1]. 

A porous media placed into a container with rigid and impermeable walls increases its 

porosity near the walls, because solid particles are unable to pack together as efficiently as 

elsewhere. Experiments have shown that the porosity is a damped oscillatory function of the 

distance from the wall, varying from a value near unity at the wall to nearly core value at 

about five particle diameters away from it [1]. 

Macroporous media is defined as the porous media in which the ratio of container diameter to 

particle diameter is smaller than 10.  

1.1. Airflow in a porous media 

The fluid flow through a porous media was at firstly studied experimentally by Darcy. His 

experiments consisted on a column filled with solid particles (sand) and an impose water flow 

along; pressure drop was measured with mercury manometers. Darcy proposed an equation 

that established the proportionality between flow rate and pressure drop for a steady state 

unidirectional flow. For an isotropic porous media, the Darcy’s equation can be written as: 



9 
 

 
 

    
 

 
                (2.2) 

Where    is the pressure gradient through the porous bed,    is the Darcy velocity, defined as 

the average  of the fluid velocity over the total volume of the porous media,   is the dynamic 

viscosity of the fluid and    is the permeability of the porous media. This last parameter 

depends only on the porous media geometry, but not on fluid nature. There are different 

equations to determine the permeability of a porous media, according to its geometry. For 

example, for a packed bed of spheres, the permeability was related to the porosity and to the 

particle diameter ( ) by the following equation. 

  
    

      
           (2.3) 

Where   is the particle diameter and    is an experimental factor related to particle shape. 

Several values between 150 and 199 can be found in literature [1, 2]. 

The increase in fluid velocities isn’t followed by a linear increase in the flow pressure drop. 

Dupuit and Forchheimer proposed to add a quadratic velocity term to Darcy’s equation, to 

take into account the drag due to the solids obstacles, which is of the same order than the 

linear term. This term can be neglected for small velocities, with Reynolds number of the 

order of one or smaller [1]. An extension of the Darcy’s law can be used to consider the 

effects of boundary friction, inertia and acceleration. This equation was obtained by analogy 

with the Navier-Stokes equation. In [2], a macroscopic momentum equation is proposed for 

natural convection in enclosed porous cavities, with Boussinesq approximation, as follows: 

      

 

    

  
 

      

  
             

  

 
     

 

 
                           

         

  
   (2.4) 

   (I)            (II)                   (III)      (IV)      (V)               (VI)                          (VII) 

Terms in that last equation stand for: (I) Acceleration term, (II) Inertia term, (III) Pressure 

gradient, (VI) Brinkman term, (V) Darcy term, (VI) Gravitational force, (VII) Forchheimer 

term. 

The Brinkman term (IV) is similar to the Laplacian one in Navier-Stokes, but    is the 

effective viscosity, which depends on the fluid viscosity   and the geometry of the porous 

media. In cases of high porosity, it can be assumed that     . The empirical  coefficient in 

Forchheimer term (VII) varies with the porous media nature.

1.2. Heat transfer in a porous media 

Heat transfer in a porous media depends on the thermal and physical properties of both the 

solid and the fluid phase. There are two types of approaches for this phenomenon: the one 

temperature model and the two temperature model.  

1.2.1. One temperature model 

This model is based on the hypothesis that the medium is isotropic, and radiant effects, 

viscous dissipation and work done by pressure changes, are negligible. One temperature 

model assumes local thermal equilibrium between solid and fluid phases, and it displays good 

accuracy whenever temperature differences between solid and fluid phases at pore scale are 

much lower than at global scale. When it is subjected to an airflow, heat transfer occurs due to 

conduction and convection, and it is characterized by the effective or equivalent thermal 

conductivity tensor (   ) and the dispersion tensor ( 
 ). In case of isotropic materials, the 

equivalent thermal conductivity tensor is a scalar, placed in the energy equation as follows: 

       
  

  
           

                                 
                  (2.5) 

where 

       
                

            
       (2.6) 

The equivalent thermal conductivity     is obtained by considering the porous medium as 

homogeneous. In case of solid and fluid phases arranged in parallel, it can be defined in a 

similar way that the equivalent heat capacity per unit volume of the medium,        
   Other 

correlations for the equivalent conductivity are presented in Chapter III. Parameters 

identification, depending on fluid and solid thermal conductivities and porosity. 

The thermal dispersion tensor    appears in cases of force convection or vigorous natural 

convection, to take into account convective heat transfer due to mixing of interstitial fluid at 

pore scale. This mixing phenomenon can occur due to the nature of the porous media: 

obstructions, recirculation, wall effect and eddies, etc [1]. The dispersion tensor is a complex 

function of matrix structure, porosity, and thermal properties of both phases and its 

hydrodynamic characteristics [4].  

 



11 
 

 
 

1.2.2. Two temperatures model 

In cases of transient heat transfer, significant heat generation or large differences in thermal 

properties between phases, the one temperature model can no longer be used, and the two 

temperatures model is introduced. This model assumes that each phase have a different local 

temperature, and the coupling of the energy equations for both phases was formulated by 

several authors using averaged local volume, and reviewed by Kaviany [4] (Eqs. (2.7) and 

(2.8)).  

       

  
                               

                                    
     

               
                    (2.7) 

       

  
                               

                                 
     

                
                     (2.8) 

This formulation adds four total thermal diffusivity tensors    ,    ,    ,     and the 

convective heat transfer coefficient between fluid and solid phases,  . Total thermal 

diffusivity tensors include the effective thermal conductivity tensor and the dispersion tensor. 

Four velocities appear in these equations, but only      have a simple interpretation, which is 

the fluid velocity [3]. 

There are different simplified models, where neglected terms are included in the convective 

coefficient  , which is experimentally obtained for particular cases. Some simplified models 

for a packed bed of spherical particles are proposed. The “Schuman model” is the simplest 

one and the less accurate of the two temperatures models, only used for transient problems. It 

considers only convection between solid and fluid phases. The “Continuous solid model” 

includes the effective thermal conductivities of solid and fluid phases, which must be 

experimentally determined with the convective heat transfer coefficient. The “Dispersion-

particle-based model” is the most complex and accurate one. It takes into account the thermal 

dispersion in the air, conduction into the solid particles, and convective heat transfer 

coefficient in the interphase. It can be only used for transient state [4], but becomes a one 

temperature model for steady state regime.

1.3. Mass conservation and frost formation in a porous media 

Unlike the case of energy balance equation, mass conservation in a porous media is only 

applied for the fluid phase, and can be written as in Eq. (2.9). 

 
  

  
                     

          (2.9) 

Where   is the specie concentration,   is the Darcy velocity,      is the effective mass 

diffusivity and       is the mass generation per unit volume of this specie. Analog to heat 

transfer, the effective mass diffusivity is composed by the molecular diffusivity and the 

dispersion mass diffusivity. Mass diffusivity depends on pressure, temperature and 

composition of the species mixture. 

In order to model mass transfer between fluid and solid phases, it could be consider in the 

source term       as in Eq. (2.10). 

                                          (2.10) 

where    is the mass transfer convective coefficient,        is the specie concentration in the 

solid surface and        is the specie concentration in the fluid. In cases of forced convection, 

the mass transfer coefficient could be obtained from the heat transfer convective coefficient 

making use of the Lewis analogy, presented in Eq. (2.11). 

   
 

          
      with    

 

  
                  (2.11) 

where    is the Prandlt number exponent in the Nusselt equation for these conditions 

(geometry, fluid and flux), and varies between 0 and 1. A usual value is 1/3. 

2. Existing models 

There are several works on heat and mass transfer models for a porous media. Laguerre et al. 

[5] studied the transient heat transfer by free convection in a packed bed of spheres, and 

developed a dispersed particle based model (including radiation between solid surfaces) and 

compared it to direct CFD model and experimental values. Both models were in agreement 

with the experimental values. The developed model for a packed bed requires less 

computational time than direct CFD, but it does not predict the details of the fluid flow and 

temperature at pore scale. Beukema et al. [6] developed a two dimensional two phase model 



13 
 

 
 

of temperature and moisture distribution during cooling and storage of fresh agricultural 

products in cylindrical containers (porous media), subjected to natural convection. The model 

results agree with experimental measures with potatoes. Dona and SewartJr [7] studied 

numerically heat transfer by natural convection into a cylindrical grain bin which contained 

stored corn, with a porous media approach, and analyzed the effect of different container 

aspect ratios. 

Pham and Willix [8] developed simple equations to describe the ratio of desiccation of frozen 

food, taking into account the dehydrate layer. Pham [9] presented equations and graphical 

methods to predict the maximum possible moisture change between product and air. Tocci 

and Mascheroni [10] proposed a model for heat and mass transfer during the storage of frozen 

food, to predict product (spheres) weight loss, using explicit finite difference methods. 

Campaño et al. propose a numerical model [11] and a simple analytical model [12] for the 

prediction of weight loss during freezing and storage of unpacked frozen food, taking into 

account the dehydrated varying layer in the product surface. They compare both, the 

numerical and analytical models, to experimental data and among them. Weight loss during 

storage depends on the freezing method, because of the mass transfer resistance of the 

dehydrate layer. They concluded that the weight loss is lower for lower temperatures, weight 

loss increase with air circulation and there is a linear increase of weight loss with relative 

humidity [11]. 

All authors agree to the fact that product weight loss increase with large amplitudes of 

fluctuations and low frequencies. In cases where package was used, it was found that it 

reduced product weight loss. However any of them studied the posterior frost formation. 

Most studies in modeling frost formation were developed for air coolers. In these conditions, 

it is important to predict the thickness of the frost layer as well as its density, since these 

factors affect significantly the rate of heat transfer and the airflow through the fins. For 

example, Wu et al. [13] developed a phase change mass transfer CFD model to predict the 

frost layer growth and densification. They concluded that the averaged frost thickness 

increased gradually with time, with the growth rate slowing down; and the average frost 

density increased with time, with the increases rate getting faster. 

Few works were found in the literature modeling heat and mass transfer and natural 

convection flow into enclosure porous media, and even less particularly on frost formation in 

frozen food porous media.

3. Proposed numerical model 

3.1. Problem description 

In this section, a numerical model is proposed to predict airflow, heat and mass transfer and 

frost formation into a close container with a bulk of frozen product, during the storage in a 

cold room. Exterior air temperature fluctuations, lead to product and air temperature 

variations, natural convection airflow, and energy and water vapor transport from one region 

to another into the container. 

In the industry, bulk product is storage into cubic pallets, cover by a plastic bag. The pallets 

are placed one above another forming towers into the cold room. For the model an 

intermediate container was taken, and it was assumed that the geometry was symmetric in the 

top and in the bottom. In order to simplify the model, cubic containers were replaced by 

cylindrical ones. Figure 2.1 presents a scheme of the geometry used in the propose model. It is 

compound by a cylindrical plastic container filled with frozen slices of carrots, perfectly 

isolated in the top and in the bottom (intermediate container). Product and air into the 

container were model as a macroporous media. The cylinder is affected by the exterior air 

temperature fluctuation only through the lateral wall. This geometry was chosen in order to 

simplify the model and to reduce the simulation time. The calculation domain is shown in 

Figure 2.2.The model outputs will be the product and air temperatures, the rate of frost 

formation, and the cumulative frost during a period of time.  

 

Figure 2.1 - Scheme of the geometry used for the model. 



15 
 

 
 

 

Figure 2.2- Scheme of calculation domain. 

 

The attention will be first drawn to the modeling assumptions: 

- The problem is axisymmetric, so a 2D model is implemented. Top and bottom of the 

container are perfectly isolated.  

- The airflow is considered as laminar. 

-  The Boussinesq approximation is used, since the change in air density is small within the 

working temperature range. The density variation under natural convection regime is taken as 

                     for the buoyancy term. 

- Air thermal inertia is neglected in respect to the product thermal inertia: 
      

          
  . 

- Internal thermal resistance into carrots slices is neglected, since Biot number (calculated 

using: frozen carrot conductivity at      :   
 

  
; convective heat transfer coefficient:  

   
 

   
  and characteristic length: half of the thickness,       ) is           .  

- Internal water mass transfer resistance into carrots is neglected. 



16 
 

 
 

- Temperature at the container external lateral wall is known as a function of time, by 

measurements. 

- Radiation heat transfer is neglected inside the container. 

- The dispersion term in the energy equation for the porous medium is neglected, because of 

the low fluid velocities. 

- Forchheimer term in momentum equation is neglected as the Reynolds number is smaller 

than one [1] (simulated air velocity of         ; pore diameter         ; and air 

kinetic viscosity,               ). 

3.2. Governing equations 

The following equations, momentum, energy and mass transfer will be solved according to 

the previous assumptions. 

3.2.1. Continuity and Momentum equations 

Continuity and momentum equations are written for the fluid phase, assuming the Boussinesq 

approximation. The momentum equation integrates also the Darcy term for fluid flow in 

porous media. 

                

 (2.12) 

  

 

    

  
 

  

  
                      

 

 
                               (2.13) 

where   is the porosity,    is the Darcy superficial air velocity into the porous medium,   is 

the permeability of the porous media and   is the thermal coefficient of volumetric expansion. 

3.2.2. Energy 

Energy equation is written for the air, Eq. (2.14), and for the product, Eq. (2.15). These 

equations are coupled by the convective heat transfer between air and product. The specific 

surface,      , is defined as the total heat transfer surface of product over the bed volume of 

porous medium. 

      
   

  
                  

                                (2.14) 



17 
 

 
 

          
   

  
     

                    
   

  
 

   

  
                  (2.15) 

where     is the equivalent conductivity of the carrots bed and   is the convective heat 

transfer coefficient inside the container (product - air). Last term of Eq. (2.15) takes into 

account latent heat of ice sublimation, where    and    are ice contents in frost and product 

per unit volume of porous medium respectively. 

3.2.3. Water mass balance 

Total water mass balance inside product container is written as follows: 

            

  
                                      (2.16) 

where   , is water content in air and      is the vapor effective or total mass diffusivity in the 

porous media. 

Eq. (2.17) describes the frost formation. If water concentration in air is higher than the 

saturation limit at product temperature              , frost is formed.  

   

  
                                         (2.17) 

Eq. (2.18) describes product dehydration, which occurs when water vapor concentration in air 

is smaller than water vapor concentration in air in equilibrium with the product     

        .  

   

  
  

 
 

  
      

                                      (2.18) 

In these equations,    is the convective mass transfer coefficient, obtained by Lewis analogy 

from the convective heat transfer coefficient, and assuming that the airflow is imposed 

externally for one single slice, and it could be consider as forced convection.       is the mass 

transfer resistance at the vegetable skin, and    is the water activity of the product. For peeled 

carrots, there is no skin resistance, but this term can be used to take into account the mass 

transfer resistance due to the thin layer of dehydrated product near the surface [8, 10, 12, 13]. 

 

 



18 
 

 
 

3.3. Initial conditions 

Air mechanical and thermal inertia are small, and therefore initial air velocity can be assumed 

to be zero and initial air temperature can be considered equal to that of product. Product initial 

temperature profile was obtained from initial temperature measurements at the center of the 

container and near the wall, by interpolation. 

It is assumed that initial water vapor concentration in air is zero (    ) and there is not frost 

on product surface (     . Although the first one is a strong hypothesis, it haven’t got 

relevant effect in the model, because the elapsed time is long and air and product reaches 

equilibrium. 

3.4. Boundary conditions 

The following equations represent the boundary conditions of the problem 

    
  

 
      

                            (2.19) 

    
  

 
      

                      (2.20) 

   
   

  
 
     

                               (2.21) 

    
   

  
 
     

                                  (2.22) 

Perfect insulation was assumed for the container top and bottom surfaces (Figure 2.1). The 

heat flux at the lateral wall was obtained by measuring the external wall temperature, along 

cycles, and the heat transfer coefficient of the wall,  . In order to consider that the lateral wall 

was in contact with air and product, each heat flux (wall/air, wall/product) was weighted with 

surface fractions assuming an isotropic media (same values as volume fractions:        [1]. 

As the container is completely close, there is not mass exchange between interior and exterior 

air, thought the walls. 

    
  

 
      

  
   

  
 
     

                     (2.23) 

The air velocity is zero on the container surfaces.

                              (2.24) 

4. Results 

The proposed model was submitted to different operational conditions, by changing the 

problem exterior air temperature and initial conditions, and compared to literature results. The 

parameter values used for the test presented in Table 2.1, were obtained by different methods 

explain in detail in Chapter III. Parameters identification. Simulations were applied to a

The problem was solved using COMSOL ® CFD software running on a Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 

computer in a PC Intel® Core ™ i7-6700K CPU @ 4.00GHz  with 15.6 GB RAM. COMSOL 

automatic meshing “Fine” was used for the discretization of the computational domain. 

Physics-controlled mesh discretize on triangular and quadrilateral elements, with refined near 

walls (3501 domain elements and 179 boundary elements). The mesh independence was done 

for the most complex problem, presented in Chapter IV. Experimental validation, where 

“Fine” mesh was adequate. 

Four temperature cycles, presented in Table 2.2, were proposed as external input. Simulations 

were performed for two hours and a half long period.

As can be seen, in all cycles, temperature varies into the domain only in radial direction, so 

temperatures in the top and in the bottom are practically the same (      and      ). 

This means that conduction heat transfer is dominant over natural convection heat transfer, as 

was expected, since convective heat transfer coefficient is very low. Another observation is 

that with this air temperature cycles, product at the center of the domain is not affected by the

exterior air temperature fluctuation, so it is practically constant in all cycles. The effect of 

thermal inertia is observed in the gap between air and product fluctuations. Results could be 

compared by taking the first cycle (I) as the reference one, and changing the mean 

temperature, amplitude and frequency of oscillation for the following three proposed cases.  

As it was expected, the increases of air temperature fluctuations keeping the same mean 

temperature and frequency (comparison cycle I to II), lead to changes of the product 

temperature, since there was an increase in the heat transfer rate. Comparing cycles I to III, it 

was observed that the increase of the mean temperature, but keeping the same amplitude and 

frequency of oscillation, caused the product to decrease its temperatures fluctuation, 

becoming practically null. This can be explained by the change in thermal diffusivity, due to 

apparent specific heat variation. Using the propose approach for apparent specific heat, and 

taking into account that it is assumed a constant density and thermal conductivity of the 

product, the thermal diffusivity ranged from                at -18ºC to   

              at -10ºC. In case of frequency increase, with the same mean temperature and 

amplitude (comparison between cycles I to IV), product temperature fluctuations decreased, 

since there was less time to perform the heat transfer. 

The calculation of the total frost formed in the container was obtained from volume 

integration in COMSOL, and plotted in Figure 2.5 for all cycles. 



24 
 

 
 

 

Figure 2.5-Simulation results, cumulative frost formation versus time for cycles I to IV.  

 

A first observation is that frost formation displayed approximately a linear growth with time, 

independently of mean temperature, amplitude and frequency of oscillation of exterior air. 

This result was also found experimentally by Phimolsiripol et al. [14] and Pham et al. [15]. 

However, it is important to recognize that all these parameters have an important effect in 

total frost formed. Cycles could be compared, once again, taking cycle I as a reference, with 

the aid of temperatures evolution in Figure 2.4. In cycle II, the amplitude of oscillation 

increased two times in comparison to cycle I. As the total frost increase twice, it seems to be 

directly proportional to oscillation amplitude, as it was found in others works: Phimolsiripol 

et al. [14], Poovarodom [16] and Laguerre and Flick [17]. In cycle III, the mean temperature 

decrease to -10ºC, and total frost decrease approximately proportionally. It means that the 

same temperature fluctuation (amplitude and frequency) have less effect on frost formation at 

higher temperatures. This result could be explained by the change in product specific heat, 

which increases significantly between -18ºC to -10ºC due to the phase change. Laguerre and 

Flick [17] proposed a model that showed that, the higher the thermal inertia, the lower frost 

formation. In cycle IV frequencies increased twice respect to cycle I, and total frost formation

decrease, since product temperature varies less than in cycle I. This result agrees with the one 

obtained by Poovarodom [16] and Laguerre and Flick [17]. Finally, it can be said that product 

temperature variation had a very important effect on frost formation, increasing with each 

other.  

5. Conclusion 

A model of heat and mass transfer was proposed in order to predict frost formation into a 

closed container filled with frozen vegetables. The problem was study as a macroporous 

media compose by the product and the surrounding air. Natural convection air flow was 

assumed into the container, who promotes water mass transport. The model was developed in 

the commercial software CFD COMSOL, and it was test imposing different exterior air 

temperature fluctuations (boundary conditions). Results of four temperature cycles were 

compared, varying one by one: average temperature, amplitude and frequency of oscillation. 

As general result it was observed that product temperature behavior is as expected, and it is 

directly associated with frost formation into the container. The bigger the product temperature 

variation, the bigger the amount of frost formed. Frost formation increase with large 

amplitude of oscillation, but decrease with higher frequencies and mean temperatures.

BULK STORAGE OF FROZEN VEGETABLES MODELED AS A 

MACROPOROUS MEDIA: PARAMETERS IDENTIFICATION 

 

 

 

 

Abstract 

This chapter deals with the parameter identification of stored frozen vegetables packed on 

pallets and submitted to heat and mass transfer phenomena. Products were modeled as a 

porous media. Parameters were obtained for two assembling: frozen slices of carrots and air, 

and frozen extra thin green beans and air. Parameter definition and evaluation combines 

literature review, measurements and numerical simulation. They were classified in three 

types, as: the ones that only depend on thermophysical properties (product density and 

apparent specific heat), which depends only on the geometry (porosity, specific surface and 

permeability) and the ones that depend on both (equivalent conductivity and convective heat 

transfer coefficient). In general, parameters which characterize these porous media, were 

similar for both products, even though they display different geometries. 

 

 

Key words: frozen food; macroporous media; vegetables; parameter identification.

1. Introduction 

1.1. Frozen food thermodynamic properties 

Food products, in particular vegetables, are mainly composed by water, around 90% (from 

Chapter 9, ASHRAE [1]), and a small fraction of solved solids. The water freezing process 

reduces the liquid water fraction, inhibiting microorganism’s growth and enzymatic activity. 

Food freezing have two important engineering aspects: the enthalpy change during freezing, 

and freezing time, which directly affects the product properties and its quality, in accordance 

to the ice crystallization into the product.  

In the study of frozen food, the water phase change must be taken into account. The presence 

of solved solids in product solution reduces the initial freezing point, in respect to pure water. 

This behavior is important since there is not a unique phase change temperature as is shown in 

Figure 3.1.a. The scheme in Figure 3.1igure 3.1.b presents the food phase change process. 

Over the initial freezing point, the food product is compound by unfrozen water ( ) and 

solids ( ). When the initial freezing point (  ) is achieved, a fraction of water becomes ice 

( ), and the solution, unfrozen water and solids (mainly sugar), increases its concentration 

reducing even more the solution freezing point.

The energy embedded on a freezing process was predicted by Eq.(3.1)

                           (3.1) 

where      is the solid particles sensible enthalpy,     is the unfrozen water enthalpy,     is 

the latent enthalpy and     is the ice water sensible enthalpy, defined as follows: 

                                    (3.2) 

                                         (3.3) 

                         (3.4) 

                              (3.5) 

Where   and     are the mass fraction and specific heat of each phase, and   ,    and   are 

initial temperature, product initial freezing point and product temperature, respectively. 

In terms    ,     and     , the mass fractions are temperature functions. Once product 

temperature is lower than initial freezing point,     and     are temperature functions also. 

These temperature dependences and the lack of knowledge about product composition, turns 

difficult to calculate enthalpy changes. The enthalpy variation needed to reduce product 

temperature under the initial freezing point could be measured by a calorimeter test 

(Differential Scanning Calorimetry). 

There are different methods to take into account the latent heat in simulations, Pham [3] 

review some of them: apparent specific heat method, enthalpy method and quasi-enthalpy 

method. In the apparent specific heat method, latent heat is merged with sensible heat to 

produce a specific heat curve with a large peak around the freezing point. 

1.2. Macroporous media characteristics 

A porous medium is a material consisting on a fixed solid matrix with interconnected void 

spaces, called pores, whose interconnection allows fluid flow through the material. Porous 

media are characterized by geometric parameters as porosity    (void fraction), specific 

surface          
    (rate of interior solid matrix surface to total volume) and 

permeability        (hydraulic resistance). Equivalent thermal conductivity        
       

and interior convective heat transfer coefficient             depends on thermodynamic 

properties of solid and fluid phases and geometric characteristics of the porous medium. 

In case of an enclosure porous medias it can be defined the macroporous media as the one in 

which the ratio of container characteristic length to particle characteristic length is smaller 

than 10. 

In natural porous media, the porosity is in general smaller than 0.6. In common porous media 

it can vary close to limit values, 0 and 1. In the case of a bed of uniform spheres, porosity 

varies between 0.2595 and 0.4764 [4]. 



32 
 

 
 

The permeability for common porous materials can be found in a wide range of orders of 

magnitude, from     to          [4]. Several authors proposed Eq. (3.6) to calculate the 

permeability of a packed bed of spheres, in respect to the porosity and particle diameter ( ). 

Each author found different values for the constant  , but all around 150 to 200 (Ben Amara 

[5]).  

  
    

       
            (3.6) 

However in our known there are no equations or experimental values for macroporous media 

with particles of others geometries and it was not found experimental values for macroporous 

media. 

The equivalent conductivity of a porous medium depends on the thermal conductivity of each 

phase, the structure of the solid matrix and the contact resistance between particles. The limit 

values of equivalent conductivity were obtained from the composite layer models [6], solid 

and fluid layers in parallel arrangement and in series arrangement. A rough and ready 

estimation could be made from the weighted geometric mean [4]. Others correlations were 

reviewed by Kaviany [7], like the Krupicza’s correlation for the isotropic equivalent 

conductivity, obtained experimentally for a packed bed of particles. Table 3.1 summarizes 

some different correlations to predict the equivalent conductivity.

In respect to the convective heat transfer coefficient into a porous media, Wakao and Kaguei 

[8] carried out a critically review of experimental values obtained for steady-state and 

unsteady-sate measurements. They re-evaluated the heat transfer coefficients, considering 

only the data they found reliable, and proposed a Nusselt correlation as a function of the 

Reynolds number. Alvarez [9] and Ben Amara et al. [10] measured experimentally the 

convective heat transfer coefficient into a macroporous media, in steady state regime, by 



33 
 

 
 

neglecting conduction and radiation between solid particles. They placed a sphere of high 

conductivity material into a packed bed of spheres of very small conductivity. An electrical 

resistance heated the sphere and temperature was measured by a thermocouple, assuming 

uniform temperature. Alvarez [9] established a Nusselt correlation for turbulent flow. Ben. 

Amara et al. [10] studied the influence of the operational parameters on the convective 

coefficient, and proposed a correlation for Reynolds in the range from 74 to 495 (low 

velocities), similar to the one proposed for Wakao and Kaguei.  

Ben Amara et al. [10] performed an experimental study of convective heat transfer during 

cooling with low air velocity in a stack of objects. They found that for low velocities 

(&lt;0.2m/s) radiation and conduction could be of the same order of magnitude as convection. 

There were several researches working with porous media, in general with spherical particles. 

However, few researches had been carried out the characterization and identification of 

macroporous media parameters, even less for confined porous media at very low air velocity. 

2. Materials and methods 

In this work, the porous media consists on frozen product and air. Properties and parameters 

of two porous media were determined by different ways, as it was explained in this section. 

2.1. Products 

Two types of frozen vegetables were studied: sliced carrots and extra thin green beans. These 

were chosen because they were the most susceptible to damage during frozen storage. For all 

measures and experiments, products were prepared from fresh vegetables. 

2.1.1. Carrot 

Frozen slices of carrots were prepared from fresh carrots, peeled, cut, and frozen in a freezer 

at temperature of      . 

Standard dimensions in the industry are diameter between       and      , and thickness 

between      and     . 

A sample of 100 carrot slices was taken to measure their average diameter and thickness, with 

the correspondent uncertainties:             and            respectively. 

2.1.2. Green beans 

Fresh extra thin green beans were prepared by removing the beans tips and then frozen at 

     . 

Standard dimensions in the industry are diameter between        and     , and length 

between       and 120  . 

Sample of 50 green beans was taken to measure their average diameter and length, with the 

correspondent uncertainties:            and              respectively. 



34 
 

 
 

 

2.2. Frozen product properties 

2.2.1. Product density 

Frozen product density was difficult to be measure experimentally, since it was not possible to 

use water, because it melts the product. For this work, product density was calculated using 

Eq. (3.7) and composition data from [1], for food products. Density depends on product 

composition and its mass fraction. 

  
 

 
  
  

            (3.7) 

where    was the mass fraction and    the density of each component (water, protein, fat, 

carbohydrate and ash). Density of each component and therefore product density depends on 

temperature.  

2.2.2. Enthalpy of phase change - Apparent specific heat 

A Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analysis of carrots was performed using the 

equipment Metter Toledo DSC 822e by a thermo analytical technique in which the difference 

in the amount of heat power (    required to increase the temperature of a sample and a 

reference, is measured as a function of temperature. 

Samples for the calorimetry test were prepared from fresh product. Approximately     

sample of product was placed in an aluminum pan, hermetically closed. Sample weight was 

recorded and then subjected to the DSC. Measures were made in the temperature range 

between       and     , with a speed of           . 

Finally, the DSC software returned values of heat power versus temperature. The apparent 

specific heat of phase change could be obtained by Eqs. (3.8) and (3.9). 

      
  

 

 

 
             (3.8) 

      
   
  

 
 

            (3.9) 

2.3. Porous media characteristics 

2.3.1. Product bulk porosity 

The porosity of a porous medium was defined as the ratio between air volume and total bed 

volume.  

  
  

    
                     (3.10) 



35 
 

 
 

In an isotropic porous media, surface porosity is equal to volumetric porosity. A porous media 

into a container with rigid and impermeable walls increase its porosity near the walls, because 

solid particles are unable to pack together as efficiency as elsewhere. Experiments have 

shown that the porosity is a damped oscillatory function of the distance from the wall, varying 

from a value near unity at the wall to nearly core value at about five particle diameters from 

the wall [4]. 

Porosity was measured using a container filled with product. The void volume was obtained 

by measuring the water volume that was possible to put into the container up to complete it. 

2.3.2. Specific surface 

The specific surface is the ratio between product total heat transfer surface and product bed 

volume.  

      
  

    
                     (3.11) 

To determine the specific surface, the number of frozen product pieces was counted in a 

known volume. Then, using the averaged product dimensions presented in sections 2.1.1 and 

2.1.2, total heat transfer surface was calculated. Knowing the container volume, the specific 

surface could be calculated. 

2.3.3. Bulk product permeability 

The permeability of a porous media is a parameter that depends on the geometry, but not on 

the fluid. An experimental bench was used to estimate the permeability of a product bed, 

submitted to very low flow velocities, comparable in order of magnitude to the natural 

convection ones. 

The experimental device (Figure 3.2) was composed by a PVC suction duct of square section 

with dimensions                     , filled with product.  

 

Figure 3.2 -Scheme of experimental device used for permeability measure.

The airflow was controlled by a variable frequency drive (SSD Drives 650) connected to the 

fan and with a valve installed in the discharge line. An Annubar (AWR-71) connected to an 

inclined tube manometer was used to measure airflow, and therefore the superficial velocity 

in the suction duct was obtained. The pressure drop in the carrots bed was measure with 

another inclined tube manometer. The range of velocities used varied between             

and            , the same order of magnitude of natural convection ones.  

The same method was previously used by Ben Amara [5] to measure product permeability. 

The momentum equation for a porous media, assuming the Bousinesq approximation and 

incompressible flow is similar to Navier Stokes but adding the Darcy and Forchheimer terms. 

  

 

    

  
 

  

  
                

 

 
                   

         

  
              (3.12) 

Where   was the porosity,   the permeability and   the Forchheimer coefficient. Since the 

experimental velocities were very small, the Forchheimer term became negligible in respect to 

the Darcy term.  The air temperature was the same as the reference one (       ), so the 

mass force term could be neglected too. Under these conditions, and assuming steady state 

regime, momentum equation was reduced to Darcy's equation, Eq. (3.13). Eq. (3.14) was a 

unidirectional version of Darcy’s. 

       
 

 
                          (3.13) 

  

  
  

 

 
                      (3.14) 

In these conditions, the permeability was determined making use of Eq. (3.14), by measuring 

pressure drop through a bulk product bed for different velocities. The experiment was 

repeated at least twice for each vegetable. 

2.3.4. Equivalent conductivity 

In this work the equivalent conductivity of the frozen product bed was identified from 

experimental measures, in the absence of convection, with a unidirectional transient pure 

conductive model in COMSOL. 

A polyurethane box of      of thickness in the lateral walls and      in the bottom, was use 

to contain the product. The interior dimensions were length, width and height, 15,5cm x 

10,7cm x 9,5cm respectively. In the top of the box a thin steel plate was placed. Three pieces 

of product (slices of carrot or green beans) were fixed exactly at known positions into the box, 

at different heights and centered, and connected to thermocouples, as it is shown in Figure 

3.3. Product and steel plate temperatures were measured by type T thermocouples 

(copper/constantan) connected to a data logger (Pico Technology TC-08) and a computer. 

A eutectic substance (PCM) with a phase change temperature of the order of -10ºC was used 

to heat up the top surface of the box. 



37 
 

 
 

 

Figure 3.3 -Scheme of experimental device used for conductivity measurement. 

Frozen product was placed in an insulated box at uniform initial cold temperature of 

approximately -20°C. The box was then placed in the freezer at -20°C, and the measurement 

started when the box was heated from the top with the PCM, allowing to impose a constant 

temperature (-10ºC) over the steel plate. Product and steel plate temperatures were measured 

along two hours. The experiment was repeated twice. 

This configuration (heating from the top), which does not generate any natural convection, 

was modeled in COMSOL considering unidirectional conductive heat transfer in transient 

regime, eq. (3.15).  

          
   

  
    

    

   
                   (3.15) 

Imposed temperature at the top (measured experimentally   ) and no heat flux at the bottom 

of the box, were taken as boundary conditions. The equivalent conductivity of the porous 

medium was obtained by comparing the temperature from the model to the measured one, and 

the least square method was used to find the best conductivity value.  

2.3.5. Convective heat transfer coefficient into the porous media 

With the objective of obtain an order of magnitude of the air-product natural convective heat 

transfer coefficient into a container, a transient experiment was mounted. The method was 

similar to the one reported by Alvarez [9] and Ben Amara [10] for macroporous media. 

A cylindrical plastic container with         of diameter and         of height, isolated with 

     polystyrene at the top and at the bottom (Figure 3.4), was filled with frozen product.  



38 
 

 
 

 

Figure 3.4 - Scheme of experimental device used for convective coefficient estimation. 

An aluminum probe with dimensions close to the ones of product (diameter         and 

thickness        for carrots; diameter        and length         for green beans) and 

equipped with a type T thermocouple, was introduce into the container with an initial 

temperature hotter that the device. The probe was surrounded by isolated objects, such as 

polystyrene slices for carrots and hollow plastic tubes for green beans, chose to avoid thermal 

contact between the probe and frozen product (Figure 3.4 and Figure 3.5). Under these 

conditions, it was assumed that convection was the unique heat transfer phenomenon affecting 

the aluminum slice. 

 

 

Figure 3.5 - Experimental device used for convective coefficient estimation, for each 

vegetable. 



39 
 

 
 

The aluminum probe temperature variation and that of the surrounding air were measured 

during the transient heat transfer experiment.  

As the aluminum conductivity was higher and the natural convection heat transfer coefficient 

was low, the Biot number (calculated using aluminum conductivity:            ; 

convective heat coefficient:             and characteristic length as half of the 

thickness:       ) was smaller than    , allowing to assume a unique temperature in the 

metallic slice. Therefore, the transient equation neglecting internal thermal resistance could be 

applied assuming a constant air temperature. Eq. (3.16) was used as follows: 

             
       with   

   

  
                 (3.16) 

Where  ,   and    are heat transfer surface, mass and specific heat of the aluminum slice 

respectively;     is the air temperature;    is the aluminum initial temperature and   the slice 

temperature varying with time. 

The convective heat transfer coefficient could be calculated by adjusting the experimental 

points with the aid of an exponential trend curve. 

3. Results 

In the governing equations for our model, presented in Chapter II, some parameters were not 

known and must be obtained from literature, calculated, measured or identified, to perform 

the simulation. Table 3.2 presents a summary of the parameters and the method use to 

evaluate them.

3.1. Frozen product density 

Product density depends on the product composition and its component individual density. 

Table 3.3 presents these data from [1]. Water in the product was a combination of ice and 

liquid water, depending on product and temperature. To simplify, it was assumed that all 

water was in solid phase.

Component density varies with temperature. However, for the working range of temperatures 

(       to      ), the calculated values varied slightly, less than 0.2%, so it was assumed a 

constant density. By taking       as the reference temperature, the carrot density was found 

to be            
   and             

   for green beans. 

3.2. Apparent specific heat 

There was not a unique phase change temperature in food products, since water was not pure, 

as it carried dissolved solids. This means that there was a range of temperatures (between 

approximately -1ºC and -18ºC) in which coexisted sensible and latent heat. The concept of an 

apparent specific heat allows for taking into account these combined phenomena. 

Figure 3.6 presents the experimental values of heat power versus temperature, for a        

sample. The shape of the curve presents the typical peak in the temperature range of phase 

change, similar to the one predicted by the apparent specific heat in Figure 3.7. However, the 

initial freezing point did not occur in the expected value, and it was slightly shifted to the 

right.

Phase change enthalpy was obtained by curve fitting, with the aid of Eqs. (3.8) and (3.9), 

starting with the initial freezing point (        ) ([2]), as shown in Figure 3.8, with an 

enthalpy origin of       . 

 

Figure 3.8 -Comparison between enthalpy experimental measure and values from [1]. 

As it can be seen, in the range of       to    , there was a similar behavior between 

experimental values and the ones from Chapter 9, ASHRAE Handbook [1]. However the 

numerical values were a bit different. 

The enthalpy balance approach was used in order to predict heat transfer with phase change 

and introduced in the numerical model. The apparent specific heat was modeled as in Eq. 

(3.17).

the free water fraction in the product,       (           ) is the water latent heat of fusion. 

The enthalpy of the product can be written from Eq. (3.18) as 

                                              (3.18) 

Figure 3.9 presents the comparison between the model, experimental measures and values 

from [1], using       as an enthalpy origin. The model tried to take into account the 

apparent specific heat in a large range of temperatures, even near the initial freezing point.

3.3. Product bulk porosity 

The porosity was measure several times, using different volume containers and fresh 

products. As it was expected, the porosity varies depending on the volume of the container 

and its geometry, mainly near the walls. 

The porosity was evaluated by measuring the void volume of the porous media with water. 

The values obtained were         for carrots and          for green beans. Both values 

were of the same order of magnitude, but green beans void volume was higher, and its 

porosity was 18% bigger. 

It is important to recognize that product geometry could vary a little when the product is 

frozen, and therefore the porosity changes. An option to measure frozen product porosity, 

could be using another fluid at low temperatures (for example oil). For this work it was 

assume that the porosity is the same using fresh or frozen product. 

3.4. Specific surface 

The specific surface obtain for frozen products were       
         for carrots and 

       
         for green benas.

3.5. Bulk product permeability 

As was presented in section 2.33, in order to measure bulk permeability, bulk fresh product 

was placed into the square suction duct. A plastic seal was used to avoid air preferential 

pathways in particular between the top and the upper wall, as shown in Figure 3.10.  

 

 

 

Figure 3.10 - Experimental device used for permeability measure. 

As permeability is a geometric parameter, it is important to take into account the geometry 

disposition of product in the bed, for example parallel to airflow, cross to airflow or 

disorganized. As bulk storage condition was to be represented, product was placed randomly, 

as is shown in Figure 3.11. 



45 
 

 
 

 

Figure 3.11 – Product distribution in the experimental device for permeability measure. 

A fan installed in the suction duct allowed imposing a constant airflow through the product 

bulk, with a superficial velocity at the inlet of the duct ranging from            

to           . 

Figure 3.12 and Figure 3.13 show measured pressure drop versus air velocity, for carrots and 

green beans respectively. The measures were repeated three times for carrots and two times 

for green beans, for the same velocities. In both cases, little data dispersion was noticed.

Figure 3.13 - Experimental measures of pressure drop in a green beans bed (length 31 cm) for

Permeability could be calculated from the slope of the linear regressions, and taking the 

dynamic viscosity of air at      ,                  . In the case of carrots bed, the 

value obtained was           
     , while for green beans bed it was          

       . 

Both values were of the same order of magnitude, however, green beans permeability was 

14% higher than carrots permeability. This result agrees with the measured porosities, since 

the bigger the porosity, the lowest the pressure drop along the porous bed and the larger the 

permeability. 

Once again fresh product was used instead of frozen product. This experiment could be 

repeated into a cold room with frozen product. For this work it was assume that the 

permeability does not vary using fresh or frozen product. 

3.6. Equivalent conductivity 

To identify the equivalent thermal conductivity of each bulk of products (carrots and green 

beans) the thermal experiment described in section 2.3.4 was performed, repeated twice for 

each vegetable as shown in Figure 3.14.

Figure 3.14 - Comparison between temperatures measured in experiments 1 (Exp 1) and 2 

(Exp 2), for carrot slices. 

A unidirectional conduction model was implemented in COMSOL software, with data from 

product density, product specific heat and porosity, calculated earlier in this work. 

In order to estimate the range of equivalent conductivity, it was evaluate for the limit 

conditions, parallel and series arranged of air and product by using equations from Table 3.1. 

The limit values for carrot slices were                   
             , and 

                  
               for green beans. 

Simulations were carried out by sweeping the equivalent conductivity in these ranges. Figure 

3.15 shows the comparison between experimental measures and simulation results for carrot 

slices, for an imposed equivalent conductivity of     
             . As it can be seen, 

the general shape of temperature evolution for different positions was similar. However, it 

was not possible to adjust all temperatures for the same value of equivalent conductivity. This 

was probably due to the porosity variation near the wall, which was not taken into account by 

the model since a uniform porosity was assumed for the entire domain. For this reason, only 

product temperature in the center of the box (  ) was used for the comparison.

The identified values of equivalent conductivity can be validated by comparing to calculated 

values by different models. Table 3.4 presents calculated values for carrot slices and green 

beans, using air conductivity            
      and product conductivities,     

            for frozen carrots (from [2]) and            
      for frozen green 

beans (calculated form product composition, according to the equation propose in Chapter 9, 

ASHRAE Handbook [1]). The difference in products conductivities and porosities explains 

that the equivalent conductivity was bigger for carrots bed than for green beans bed.  

As it can be seen, the identified equivalent conductivities were into the range established by 

parallel and series models. The others correlations also gave results between these limits. The 

geometric model gave a good approximation, as an order of magnitude. However, this model 

give better results the more similar were fluid and solid conductivities [4]. Using Krupiczka 

correlation, the values calculated in both cases were very similar to the experimental ones. 

The error, defined as in Eq. (3.21), was 7.1% for carrots and 10% for green beans.

Finally the method proposed to identify the equivalent conductivity of a porous medium was 

adequate.

3.7. Convective heat transfer coefficient 

The experiment was repeated twice for each vegetable, and it was checked that measures were 

repeatable. Air and product temperatures were measured during 50 minutes, but only 

temperature differences in the range of               were taken, similar to expected 

values into the container. Figure 3.19 presents measured temperatures for air and aluminum

the Nusselt number for a single sphere was      , and using the slice diameter as 

characteristic length,              and the air conductivity               
      , 

the convective coefficient was               .  

Considering the local natural convection, the correlation proposed by Yuge [11] for heat 

transfer between a single sphere and air could be used to obtain an order of magnitude.  

                                           (3.22) 

Using the temperature difference obtained from the simulation of the order of    , diameter 

as the characteristic length (           ), and air properties at -15°C (       

         ,              
     and                 ) the Grashoff was     

    . Finally the Nusselt number was     and the convective heat transfer coefficient 

obtained was              . 

For a bed of spheres, Wakao and Kaguei [8] proposed the following correlation for forced 

convection. 

                                       (3.23) 

In the present experiment, the Reynolds number was of the order of  , calculated after a 

simulated velocity            ), the diameter as a characteristic length              

and air kinematic viscosity (               ). The convective heat transfer coefficient 

using Eq. (3.23) is            .  

Ben Amara [10] proposed a correlation obtained for a macroporous media compose by 

spheres in cubic arrange, as follows.  

                                        (3.24) 

This correlation was obtained from an experimental measurement, similar to the one proposed 

here, and also similar to the one of Wakao and Kaguei (Eq. (3.19)). The convective heat 

transfer coefficient using Eq. (3.24) is             .  

Despite these correlations were for spheres and in some cases for a single one, the values 

obtained were of the same order of magnitude than the experimental one.  

The same procedure was repeated with green beans (Figure 3.21) and the time constant was 

           and convective coefficient was           
     .

Similar to carrots, this coefficient was compared to different correlations. Assuming a unique 

green bean in conditions of natural convection, the convective coefficient can be estimate as a 

horizontal and vertical cylinder. For horizontal cylinder, the Rayleigh number was   , 

calculated from air properties at -15°C (                ,              
     , 

               and        ), diameter as the characteristic length (         ) 

and a temperature difference of 1ºC. Making use of the correlation present in Eq. (3.25) from 

[12] for an infinite horizontal cylinder, the Nusselt number was       and the convective 

coefficient was            .

The Rayleigh number was           (      ) and Nusselt obtained from Eq. (3.26)

Considering the condition of force convection of a cylinder with cross airflow, Nusselt can be 

calculated from Eq. (3.27) [12]. The values of constant   and   depends on the Reynolds 

number, which was    , calculated from a velocity obtained from the simulation     

        ) diameter as a characteristic length             and air kinematic viscosity 

(               ). For the range of         ,         and       . Nusselt 

was      and the convective coefficient was            . 

                                 (3.27) 

Another way to estimate the convective coefficient was by assuming arranges as an aligned or 

staggered tube bank, subjected to airflow. Zhukauskas [12] proposed the correlation present in 

Eq. (3.28) for tube bank.  

               
  

   
 

    

                  (3.28) 

Constant   and   varies depending on the Reynolds number (      ) and the arrangement 

(aligned or staggered). Even when the correlation could be applied for Reynolds bigger than 

10, a rough approximation was done. For aligned tube bank and           (      

and      ) Nusselt is      and the convective heat transfer coefficient is             . 

For staggered tube bank and           (      and      ) Nusselt is      and the 

convective heat transfer coefficient was             .  

Finally, it was concluded that the value obtained experimentally for the convective heat 

transfer coefficient for green beans was of the same order of magnitude than the different 

estimations from correlations for cylinders. 

In Table 3.5 they are summarized the results obtained for all the parameters for each porous 

media.

4. Conclusion 

Parameters can be classified in three types: the ones which depend only on thermophysical 

properties (product density and apparent specific heat), which depends only on the geometry 

(porosity, specific surface and permeability) and the ones which depends on both (equivalent 

conductivity and convective heat transfer coefficient). From the results, summarized in Table 

3.5, it can be seen that parameters in the first case, were similar for both vegetables since they 

were compose mainly by water (carrots 87.79% and green beans 90.27%). Green beans 

density is 2% smaller than carrot density. Pure geometric parameters were of the same order 

of magnitude for both porous media, but were a bit bigger for green beans than for carrots. It 

was not strange since product geometries were completely different. Green beans porosity 

was 18% bigger, specific surface was 33% bigger and permeability was 14% bigger, respect 

to carrots. These results appear to be in concordance, since the biggest the porosity, the 

biggest the permeability. In case of the last two parameters, equivalent conductivity and 

convective heat transfer coefficient, the results were of the same order of magnitude. 

However, the equivalent conductivity varied more significantly, since it is directly related 

with the geometric appearance. As the porosity is smaller for carrots, there were more 

vegetables per bed volume, leading to a higher conductivity, and less air with lower 

conductivity. That situation explained the equivalent conductivity augmentation on 28.5%. In 

the case of convective coefficient, differences in geometric characteristics appear not to have 

a large impact. Fluid (air) and solid phases in porous media have similar thermal properties, 

and finally the convective coefficients were practically the same (7% higher for carrots bed). 

In general, parameters which characterize these porous media were similar for both products, 

even though the different geometries.

BULK STORAGE OF FROZEN VEGETABLES AS A MACROPOROUS 

MEDIA: MODEL EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION 

 

 

 

Abstract 

This chapter is dedicated to the experimental validation of the numerical model developed to 

predict frost formation during storage of frozen vegetables submitted to external temperature 

fluctuations. The numerical model is able to predict air velocity field, air and product 

temperatures, and local frost formation. Results are validated in respect to a set of 

independent experimental results that shown in general a good agreement. Airflow circulation 

is as expected due to natural convection. Product temperature simulated behavior agrees with 

measurements, and temperature values differ by less than 12%. Frost formation predicted by 

the model was            , smaller than the experimental measurement of           , 

but still within the same order of magnitude. The model predicted correctly the most 

susceptible regions to frost formation. The effect model parameters was analyzed in order to 

point out how to improve it. Frost formation is mostly affected by the effective mass 

diffusivity and convective heat coefficient within the storage container. Better simulated 

results (           )are obtained by the adjustment of these parameters.

1. Introduction 

In the frozen food industry, in particular for vegetables, products are frozen and bulk stored 

into box pallets at low temperature in cold rooms. Storage duration can range from few 

months up to one year, before market distribution. During that long-term storage, frozen 

products may be exposed to air temperature fluctuations that can impact product quality. 

Thereafter, losses can be expected due to a poor management of storage environmental 

conditions. 

A number of studies in the literature have shown the effect of both, temperature fluctuations 

and heterogeneity, on product quality. Quality losses and kinetics degradation such as vitamin 

C, color and drip loss are often considered an important issue to be reduced (Martins et al. [1], 

Theofania Tsironi et al. [2]). 

Frost formation during storage of frozen food is also one of major industrial problems. 

Experimental studies (Poovarodom [3]) have been dedicated to analyze the influence of 

temperature changes in average, amplitude and frequency of fluctuations. Laguerre and Flick 

[4] studied experimentally frost formation on packed bed of potato and melon balls inside 

hermetic boxes, stored in domestic freezers. They proposed a qualitative simplified model to 

explain the observed phenomena. These models showed that frost was developed whenever 

the temperature was low inside the box and/or its fluctuation was also low. They observed 

less frost in more insulated boxes, less frost at higher frequency and lower amplitude of 

exterior air temperature variation, and less frost for potatoes than for melon balls due to the 

lower surface water activity. 

Desiccation of frozen food during storage has been studied by several authors [5 - 9], that 

generally admit that both, large amplitude of fluctuations and low frequencies, increase 

weight loss in product. 

Pallet boxes may be heated or cooled due to external air fluctuation along the storage period, 

causing the product to change from one position to another inside the pallet, followed by 

variations on the pallet inside air temperature. Close to the external walls, product and air 

temperature can be submitted to more intense changes than the ones in the core of the pallet, 

due to thermal inertia. Water from warmer product is sublimated, transported by the air and 

finally deposited at the cooler frozen surfaces, where frost formation occurs.  

Few works in literature report natural convection in food stacks. Laguerre et al. [10] studied 

the transient heat transfer by free convection in a packed bed of spheres in a refrigerated 

cavity. They proposed a porous media approach and compared it with direct CFD method and 

experimental measures. The numerical results obtained with both approaches were in good 

agreement with the experimental values. CFD approach required more computational time, 

and the proposed approach did not predict in detail the fluid flow patterns and temperature at 

pore scale. Evaporative mass transfer inside bulks submitted to natural convection was studied 

by Beukema et al. [11]. They developed a two dimensional and two phase model (product-air) 

to predict temperature and moisture distribution during cooling and bulk storage of fresh 



63 
 

 
 

agricultural products in a cylindrical container. They validated the proposed model with 

experimental values for potatoes during long time periods. 

Despite the importance of frost formation during storage of frozen food, there is little work on 

the modeling of the coupled phenomena: airflow, heat transfer and mass transfer for bulk of 

frozen food porous media under natural convection. 

The objective of this chapter is to establish and validate a numerical model able to predict 

airflow, heat transfer and frost formation in a cylindrical container filled with bulk frozen 

vegetables (slices of carrots) exposed to temperature fluctuations. Parameters were obtained 

from literature or by experimental identification, and the model was validated by performing 

independent experiments. 

2. Numerical modeling 

In this section, a numerical model is proposed to predict airflow, heat and mass transfer and 

frost formation into a close container with a bulk of frozen product, during the storage in a 

cold room. Figure 4.1 depicts the cylindrical container filled with slices of carrots, used in the 

proposed model. 

 

Figure 4.1 - Simulation domain for the numerical simulation of airflow, heat and mass 

transfer and frost formation filled with slices of carrots. 

The container lateral wall was meant to be built with plastic material, and top and bottom 

surfaces were perfectly insulated. That imposition, although not physically realistic, may 

represent an intermediate sample of frozen products within a pallet tower, placed inside the 

cold room.  

Product and air inside the container were model as a macroporous media. The container was 

submitted to air temperature fluctuation only through the lateral wall. This geometry was 



64 
 

 
 

chosen in order to simplify the model and to reduce the simulation time, and the calculation 

domain is shown in Figure 4.2.  

 

Figure 4.2 - Scheme of calculation domain of the cylindrical container. 

The model outputs will be the product and air temperatures, the rate of frost formation, and 

the cumulative frost during a period of time.  

Modeling assumptions are as follows: 

- The problem was axisymmetric, suitable to a 2D modeling. Container top and bottom 

surfaces were assumed to be perfectly insulated. 

- The container inside airflow was considered as laminar. 

-  The Boussinesq approximation was assumed, since the air density variation was very small 

within the working temperature range. The air density variation under natural convection 

regime was taken as                      for the buoyancy term. 

- Air thermal inertia was neglected in respect to product thermal inertia: 
      

          
  . 

- Internal thermal resistance into carrot slices was neglected, since the predicted Biot number 

was 0.0042, smaller than the usual limit (0.1). Frozen carrot conductivity     
 

  
      ; 

convective heat transfer coefficient       
 

   
; characteristic length (half of the carrot 

thickness)           .  

- Internal water transfer resistance into carrots was neglected. 



65 
 

 
 

- Temperature of the external lateral container wall was known experimentally, as a function 

of time. 

- Radiation heat transfer was neglected inside the container. 

- The dispersion term in the energy equation for the porous medium was neglected. 

2.1. Governing equations 

The following equations, momentum, energy and mass transfer were solved according to the 

previous assumptions. 

2.1.1. Momentum 

Continuity and momentum equations were used assuming the Boussinesq approximation. The 

momentum equation integrates also the Darcy term for fluid flow in porous media. 

                  (4.1) 

  

 

    

  
 

  

  
                      

 

 
                      (4.2) 

where    is the porosity,    the Darcy superficial air velocity into the porous medium,   the 

porous media permeability and   the thermal coefficient of volumetric expansion. 

2.1.2. Energy 

Energy equation was written for the air, Eq. (4.3), and for the product, Eq. (4.4), and coupled by the 

convective heat transfer between them. The specific surface,      , was defined as the 

total heat transfer surface of carrots over bed volume of porous medium. 

      
   

  
                  

                       (4.3) 

          
   

  
     

                    
   

  
 

   

  
         (4.4) 

where     is the equivalent conductivity of carrots bed and   the convective heat transfer 

coefficient inside the container. Last term of Eq. (4.4) takes into account latent heat of ice 

sublimation, where    and    are ice contents in frost and product per unit volume of porous 

medium respectively. 

2.1.3. Water mass balance 

Total water mass balance inside product container is written as follows,  

            

  
                             (4.5) 



66 
 

 
 

where   , is water content in air and      is the vapor effective or total mass diffusivity in the 

porous media. 

Equation (4.6) describes the frost formation.  

   

  
                                (4.6) 

Frost is formed whenever vapor concentration in air is higher than saturated vapor 

concentration at product temperature             .  

Equation (4.7) describes product dehydration, which occurs when vapor concentration in air is 

smaller than vapor concentration in air in equilibrium with the product               .  

   

  
  

 
 

  
      

                             (4.7) 

In these equations,    was the convective mass transfer coefficient, obtained from the 

convective heat transfer coefficient using Lewis analogy.       was the mass transfer 

resistance of the vegetable skin, and    was the water activity of the product. Although there 

is not skin resistance on peeled carrots, this term was used to take into account the mass 

transfer resistance due to the thin layer of dehydrated product near the surface [5, 9, 12, 13]. 

2.2. Initial conditions 

Mechanical and thermal inertia of air were very small, allowing to assume initial air velocity 

to be zero and initial air temperature to be equal to that of the product. Product initial 

temperature profile was obtained by data interpolation from initial temperature measurements 

at the center of the container and near its wall. 

It was assume that air initial vapor concentration was zero (    ) and there was no frost on 

product surface (      . 

2.3. Boundary conditions 

Modeling assumptions declared in the begging of this chapter allowed to write the following 

boundary conditions: 

        
 

 
         

 

 
                     (4.8) 

    
  

 
      

             (4.9) 

    
  

 
      

                      (4.10) 

   
   

  
 
     

                               (4.11) 



67 
 

 
 

    
   

  
 
     

                                  (4.12) 

A symmetry condition along the z axis was used for all equations, and the partial derivative in 

respect to  was zero for all variables. Air velocity along the container inside surfaces was 

assumed to be null, so no slip condition was used. 

The lateral wall heat flux was calculated after the measured external wall temperature along 

the cycle sampling, together with estimated wall heat transfer coefficient  . A weighting 

surface factor was assumed to consider the lateral wall contact with both air and product, by 

considering the same values of volume fractions (      . Perfect insulation at the top and 

the bottom of the container was assumed. 

As the container was sealed, there was no mass exchange between inside and outside 

environments, thought the walls.

2.4.1. Bulk product porosity 

The porosity  of a porous medium is defined as the ratio of air volume to the total bed 

volume, and was evaluated by measuring the void volume of the porous media with water. 

The obtained value was       . 

2.4.2. Specific surface 

The specific surface is the ratio of total heat transfer surface of product to the bed volume. To 

determine the specific surface, a sample of 100 frozen carrot slices were measured at      . 

The specific surface calculated from these values was            
   (diameter:      

       and thickness:           ).  

2.4.3. Product density 

Product density   was calculated using the equation and composition data from Chapter 9, 

ASHRAE Handbook [14], Thermal properties of foods, neglecting product porosity. 

  
 

 
  
  

                    (4.14) 

where    was the mass fraction and    the density of each component (water, protein, fat, 

carbohydrate and ash). The calculated values slightly depend on temperature, and for the 

reference temperature of -15°C the carrot density was            . 

2.4.4. Product specific heat 

An apparent specific heat       was used, Eq. (4.15), based on the enthalpy method [15].  

                 
  

  
                  (4.15) 



69 
 

 
 

where      (         
   [14]) was the specific heat of a completely frozen product,    

(       [14]) was the product water content,       (         ) was the water latent heat of 

fusion. The   function varies from 0 (completely frozen) to 1 (unfrozen) within a temperature 

range of 10 °C (from          to        , the initial freezing point [14]). 

2.4.5. Bulk product permeability 

Bulk product permeability was identified for a one-dimensional flow, using a method 

previously reported by Ben Amara [16]. An experimental workbench was built (Figure 4.3) 

for that task, where slices of carrots were placed on a square section PVC suction duct 

(                    ). 

 

Figure 4.3 -Experimental workbench built to measure bulk product permeability. 

Airflow rate and its superficial velocity were measured at the fan discharge with an Annubar 

flow meter (OxitrolAWR-71), connected to an inclined tube manometer. The pressure drop 

generated by the bulk product bed (0.4 m in length) was measured with an inclined tube 

manometer (+/- 0.1 Pa). Very low velocities were promoted for this experiment, similar in 

order of magnitude to the ones under natural convection. 

Under these conditions, the momentum equation becomes the Darcy`s equation, assuming 

steady state and air at reference temperature (       ).  

  

  
  

 

 
                      (4.17) 

Air velocity ranged from            to            and the corresponding pressure drop is 

displayed in Figure 4.4.

fitting. 

The permeability calculated from these data was               . 

2.4.6. Equivalent conductivity 

The equivalent or effective conductivity of the bulk of frozen carrots was identified by 

solving a one dimensional conduction model, validated experimentally. Frozen carrots were 

placed in an insulated box (Figure 4.5) its top wall made of a steel plate.  

 



71 
 

 
 

 

Figure 4.5 - Insulated box built to acquire data to calculate the equivalent or effective 

conductivity of the bulk of frozen carrots. 

A single type T thermocouple was introduced in the inside of a slice of carrot placed at the 

center of the bulk and at the steel plate, and connected to a data logger (Pico Technology TC-

08). The box was kept 24 hours at stable temperature of -20°C and then heated from the top 

by a phase change material (-10°C), disposed over the steel plate. Sample temperatures were 

recorded along 2 hours. 

Top heating allowed for avoiding natural convection inside the box.  A one directional and 

transient heat conduction model was solved with COMSOL (Eq. 4.18) with adapted boundary 

conditions: imposed temperature at the top and no heat flux at the bottom of the box.   

          
   

  
    

    

   
                   (4.18) 

Equivalent conductivity was then identified by a least square procedure, comparing 

experimental temperatures and simulated ones, shown in Figure 4.6 for the equivalent 

conductivity of            
     . 



72 
 

 
 

 

Figure 4.6 - Comparison between experimental and simulated temperatures versus time, to 

determine equivalent conductivity of the porous media. 

 

Another way to estimate the equivalent conductivity for a porous media is given by the 

weighted geometric mean model [17], as follows.  

          
     

       
 
                   (4.19) 

The equivalent conductivity     calculated by that last equation was            
     , 

with air conductivity                
     , and frozen carrot conductivity         

           . The calculated (            ) and identified equivalent (            ) 

conductivities were of the same order of magnitude.  

2.4.7. Convective heat transfer coefficient 

A non-stationary method was employed in order to obtain an order of magnitude for the 

convective heat transfer coefficient between frozen slices and air inside the bulk of frozen 

carrots, similar to the one reported previously by Alvarez [18] and Ben Amara et al. [19], and 

depicted in Figure 4.7.

Figure 4.7 - Experimental device used for convection coefficient measure 

Measurements were carried out in a cylindrical plastic container (         diameter and 

        height) filled with frozen carrots, and isolated at the top and bottom with     of 

polystyrene layer. An aluminum slice (diameter:         and thickness:        ) was 

placed in the center of the experimental device to act as a temperature probe, equipped with a 

calibrated type T thermocouple. The probe at high temperature (20°C) was placed at the 

center of the bulk of frozen carrots at approximately -20ºC, surrounded by polystyrene slices 

of similar dimensions, in order to avoid heat conduction. Probe temperature   and air 

temperature    were continuously acquired to allow for estimating the convective heat 

transfer over the probe, as shown in Figure 4.8, for a temperature range of           

   .

.  

Figure 4.8 - Air and probe temperatures measured in the experimental device depicted in 

Figure 4.7. 

The probe Biot number      was estimated to be less than 0.1 (aluminum 

conductivity            ; convective heat coefficient            and characteristic 

length as half of slice thickness,       ).Once the probe could be modeled by a lumped 

approach, its uniform internal temperature T was expressed as follows, for a constant air 

temperature:

where  ,  ,    and    are the slice heat transfer surface, mass, specific heat and initial 

temperature respectively.  

The convective heat transfer coefficient was estimated from that approach, with a value of 

           . 

2.4.8. Heat transfer coefficient across the container wall 

This coefficient took into account the conductive thermal resistance of the        thick 

plastic wall, with              thermal conductivity (ploypropylene). The wall heat 

transfer coefficient was              . 



75 
 

 
 

2.4.9. Saturated vapor concentration 

Saturated vapor concentration was calculated from equation (4.23), assuming the air as an 

ideal gas 

        
        

  
                    (4.23) 

Saturated vapor pressure was calculated from Clapeyron equation. 

             
 
     

 
 

 

    
 

 

 
  

                  (4.24) 

The reference values used for pressure and temperature were               and      

                 respectively and  was the water molar mass. 

2.4.10. Effective mass diffusivity 

The effective mass diffusivity of the porous media      considers the molecular diffusivity 

(  ) and the dispersion term (  ). The second one appears to takes into account effects of 

mass transfer due to hydrodynamic mixing of the interstitial fluid at the pore scale. If Peclet 

number    defined as in Eq. (4.25) is lower than one, molecular diffusion dominates, and 

otherwise mass dispersion cannot be neglected [20].  

        
    

  
                    (4.25) 

2.5. Numerical resolution 

The set of differential equations was solved with the aid of COMSOL® CFD software 

running on a Ubuntu 16.04 LTS computer in a PC Intel® Core ™ i7-6700K CPU @ 4.00GHz  

with 15.6 GB RAM. All calculated outputs, including temperatures and water contents, were 

performed every 120 seconds, in accordance to the experiment time step.  

The discretization of the computational domain was done with COMSOL automatic meshing. 

Physics-controlled mesh was employed, which consist on triangular and quadrilateral 

elements, with refined near walls. “Fine” and “Finer” meshes were tested for the mesh 

independence study. Table 4.2 shows the number of domain and boundary elements for each 

mesh.

Table 4.3 presents the maximum difference between the values of temperature (   ) and 

frost formed (    ) obtained from the simulation of one day (24 hours) of an impose 

temperature cycle (cycle 1presented in section 3.4), with both meshes.

Temperature 0.092 ºC 0.05%

As it can be seen, the temperature variations were very small in respect to the order of 

magnitude of the measured values. The maximum difference in frost formation 

represented      of the total frost formed during one day. After that, it was assumed that 

results were independent of the mesh refinement so a “Fine” mesh was used. The 

characteristics of this mesh were: 3233 triangular elements, 268 quadrilateral elements, 

minimum element quality 0.121 and average element quality 0.8824. 

3. Materials and methods 

In order to evaluate the influence of temperature variation on frost formation, containers filled 

with frozen carrots were placed sequentially in different freezers. 

3.1. Product 

This study was carried out using fresh commercial grade carrots. Frozen slices were prepared 

out of fresh carrots, peeled, cut, and frozen in a freezer at temperature of -30°C. The averaged 

slices dimensions were mentioned in section 2.4.2. 

3.2. Containers 

Carrots were storage in cylindrical plastic (polypropylene 5) containers of       (diameter   

       ; height          ; wall thickness         ). These containers were insulated 

at the top and bottom with        thick expanded polystyrene (             ). 

Carrotswere disposed in the container into four separated regions (A, B, C, D) made with 

semi rigid plastic grids of the same volume (Figure 4.9). These sets up allowed do generate a 

central zone separated from a peripheral one; and in two levels, to perform the analysis of 

water migration into the container. 



77 
 

 
 

 

Figure 4.9 - Plastic grids used into the container to measure frost in each region. 

Some carrots slices in the container were equipped with thermocouples, allowing to measure 

the temperature at the center of regions A and C, and near to the surface in regions B and D. 

Wall and exterior air temperatures were also measure. 

3.3. Freezers 

Three commercial freezers were used, set to the temperatures of            ,       

      and           .  

3.4. Temperature cycles 

Experiments were carried out with two different air temperature cycles (Table 4.4), which 

were performed daily for a two month long period, except for the weekends. 

Table 4.4 - Temperature cycles 1 and 2

Cycle 1 kept the container in the freezer at        and one hour a day it climbed        ; 

Cycle 2 kept the container in the freezer at the same        and six hour a day at         . 



78 
 

 
 

Product, wall and exterior air temperatures were measured for each temperature cycle, using 

thermocouples type T (copper/constantan) connected to a data logger (Pico Technology TC-

08) and a computer.  

3.5. Frost formation 

Frost formation was measured weekly by weight loss for the four regions (A, B, C, D) during 

the two month of temperature cycling. To evaluate weight loss, containers were opened in a 

low temperature room (     ), and each region was removed separately and was shacked 

during 30 seconds to remove the frost formed on carrots surface. Frost was deposited over an 

absorbent paper and then it is weighted using a balance of high precision (       ).  

The drawbacks of this method are that it may have errors due to several issues, like 

environmental influences, handling operation or hysteresis effects due to frost removal on 

each measure. On the other hand, this method is extremely simple, cheap and easily 

implemented. 

4. Results 

The cycles 1 and 2 used for the experimental measurements were simulated using the 

proposed model and imposing the container wall temperature measure experimentally during 

the cycles, as a boundary condition. Results from experiments and simulations were analyzed 

and compared to validate the model. A study of the effect of the identified parameters in the 

model was done. Finally an estimation of frost formed in real conditions is present. 

4.1. Temperature 

Product temperatures were measured into the container in the center of each region as 

described in section 3. Figure 4.10 and Figure 4.11 shows simulated and measured 

temperature evolution over time, for cycles 1 and 2, respectively.  



79 
 

 
 

 

Figure 4.10 - Comparison between experimental and simulated temperatures for cycle 1. 

 

 

Figure 4.11 - Comparison between experimental measured and simulated temperatures for 

cycle 2. 



80 
 

 
 

From the last figures can be observed a good agreement between experimental values and 

simulated ones, as they show the same behavior. Nevertheless, simulated temperatures only 

vary along the radial direction (      and      ). Experimental temperatures show slight 

differences between top and bottom of the container. Temperature differences       and 

      varied with time and it was smaller than    . This can be explained by differences in 

experimental insulation between top and bottom. Indeed the shape of the container lid could 

generate a thermal resistance at the upper surface. Despite similar thermal behavior from 

simulations and experimental measures, the simulated temperature curves were always 

slightly higher than the experimental ones. Table 4.5 presents the maximum deviation 

between simulated and measured temperatures for each cycle. The biggest differences were 

      for cycle 1 and       for cycle 2, which represents an error less than 12% and 8% 

respectively, respect to experimental temperatures in ºC. 

 

Table 4.5 - Maximum difference between experimental and numerical values of temperatures. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In cycle 1 (Figure 4.10), product near the wall quickly changed its temperature, following the 

behavior of the wall temperature. During the first hour, the product was heated from the wall 

and its temperature was smaller than the one at the wall. Product temperature increases fast 

because of the temperature difference between product and wall. After one hour, when the 

container returns to the freezer at      , wall temperature decreases and product was hotter 

than the wall and there was a heat flux in the opposite direction. Product temperature 

decreases slowly because temperature difference between product and wall was smaller than 

during the first hour. Product in the center (A, D) changes its temperature more slowly and 

there was a delay due to the thermal inertia. Temperature increased during the first two hours 

and a half and its temperature increase rate increased with time since temperature difference 

between product in the center and in the periphery become bigger. At six hours experimental 

values show that practically all the system was in equilibrium. 

In cycle 2 (Figure 4.11) the behavior of product temperatures was similar near the wall and in 

the center. As time heating the cylinder was bigger and temperature difference between 

product and wall was smaller than in cycle 1, the effect of thermal inertia was smaller.

4.2. Frost formation 

Different phenomena are involved during frost formation. Completely frozen products consist 

of ice and liquid water (bounded water) with high concentration of solved solid. Air and 

product temperatures may change when submitted to external air cycles. If vapor 

concentration of the surrounding air is lower than saturated vapor concentration at product 

surface, ice may sublimate and water vapor is transferred to the air. In that case, the latent 

heat needed to sublimate water was provided by the product itself. After that, water vapor was 

transferred to the air by diffusion and free convection. Humid air may undergo condensation 

by reaching cold surfaces (temperature lower than the air dew point), causing frost formation 

to start around the product surfaces. At the beginning of the process, when the product surface 

is frost free, nucleation phenomena occur, giving place to the subsequent crystal growth. That 

ice crystal deposition increases cycle by cycle. 

Phenomena involved can be classified in periodic, like the ones induced by temperature 

cycles, or non-periodic, as nucleation that occurs at the beginning of the frost formation 

process. As soon as the nucleuses are formed, water vapor condensates and increases the ice 

crystal size. Product dehydration is another important non-periodic phenomenon caused by 

accumulative product water sublimation along cycle repetition. Water vapor from the 

sublimation front diffuses through this layer, up to the surface. Mass transfer resistance 

increases with time, reducing the frost formation rate. 

4.2.1. Experimental results 

Figure 4.12 shows experimental results of the cumulative frost formation into the container 

during two months, for cycle 1 and 2.  

 

Figure 4.12 - Experimental values of cumulative frost formation for cycles 1 and 2, 

experiment 1. 



82 
 

 
 

The rate of frost formation along the experiment elapsed time was constant, meaning that the 

periodic phenomena have more impact in frost formation than non-periodic ones. The 

experimental values could be approximated by a linear correlation, and its slope gave the rate 

of frost formation. Values for frost formation rates were of the same order of magnitude for 

both cycles, as their driving forces were of the same order of magnitude, given by 

                                      for cycle 1 and              

     18°               for cycle 2. 

Frost measurements were repeated using four cylinders for cycle 1 and two for cycle 2. Table 

4.6 

Table 4.6 displays the correspondent rate of frost formation, together with their determination 

coefficient (  ).

The variability of the measurements was less than 24%, so it was concluded that despite of the 

little precision of the experimental measurement, the results could be used to have an order of 

magnitude of the frost formation rate. 

4.2.2. Simulation results 

Cylinder behavior was simulated and results are displayed in the next two figures, based on a 

radial plane, with the symmetry axis on the left hand side and the exterior wall on the right 

hand side. 

Figure 4.13 and Figure 4.14 bring product temperature distribution (a) and frost formed (b), 

with superposed air velocity field, after 1 hour and 2 hours time simulation, respectively, for 

cycle 1. Cycle started at     when the container was placed in the freezer at high 

temperature,     .

Figure 4.15 - Schematic air circulation into the container: a. Time 1 hour, b. Time 2 hours. 

During the first hour the container was heated from the exterior. As can be seen from product 

temperature distribution (Figure 4.13.a), heat transfer into the container was dominated by 

conduction, and convection was neglected (temperature depends mainly on radial position). 

Interior air near the wall increases its temperature and a natural airflow was generated. This 

air moves up near the wall and down in the center of the container, where its temperature 

decrease because of the contact with cold product (Figure 4.15.a). Air velocity was of the 

order of          (maximal value:           ). As air and product temperatures increase, 

air relative humidity decreases and mass transfer potential (sublimation) increases. Air moved 

up parallel to the wall transporting the vapor. When the air reached a cold region, in which 

product temperature was lower than the air dew point, vapor in the air condensate over 

product surface. In Figure 4.13.b it can be seen that the biggest rate of frost formation was in 

the top, separated from the wall, but not in the center of the container, because most vapor 

condensate before arriving to the center of the container. The maximum frost formation rate 

for this instant was                  . 

After 2 hours the cylinder had been into the freezer at        for one hour and the container 

was cooled from the wall. The temperature near the wall was decreasing, but due to porous 

media thermal inertia, there was a hotter region between the wall and the center of the 

container (Figure 4.14.a).  For this reason appears two air circulations which moves down 

near the wall and in the center of the container, and moves up in the hotter region (Figure 

4.15.b). The order of magnitude of the air velocity was ten times smaller than after 1 hour 

(maximal value:           ). In this regime, water from the product in the hotter region 

sublimates, and then condensate mainly near the wall which was the coldest region in the 

container (Figure 4.14.b). For this time, the maximum frost formation rate was       

            , lower but of the same order of magnitude than after 1 hour. Figure 4.16.a 



85 
 

 
 

shows the frost concentration           into the container after one day (86400 seconds) of 

cycle 1. As can be see the biggest concentration was in the wall surface. In Figure 4.16.b the 

region next to the wall was suppress to have better resolution in the center of the domain, and 

it can be observed that in the top but separate from the wall there is another high 

concentration region as was explained before. 

 

a.       b. 

Figure 4.16 - Frost concentration           after one day (86400 s) of cycle 1. 

Figure 4.17 shows the cumulative frost formation during one day of cycle 1. The rate of frost 

formation can be separated in two stages with completely different values. During the first 

hour and a half, there was a high rate (         ) because of the big change in exterior 

temperature. Then frost continued increasing but with a decreasing rate. After about 10 hours, 

when achieved a regime and the rate became constant (           ). Frost continued 

increasing successively due to the low fluctuation into the freezer at      . The rate of frost 

formation depends on temperature fluctuation and even though temperature fluctuations are 

small (      this could be an important problem in the storage of frozen product during long 

periods of time. From these values, and assuming that during the weekend the small constant 

rate applies, total frost formed in one week was            . This was smaller than the 

experimental value,             (mean value of 4 repetitions), but of the same order of 

magnitude. The same occurs for cycle 2, total frost formed from simulation was        

    , which was smaller than the experimental value,             (mean value of 2 

repetitions).

Figure 4.17 - Simulated cumulative frost formation during one day, for cycle 1. 

Figure 4.18 presents the averages percentages of frost measured experimentally in each region 

for cycle 1. The results were 20% in region A, 23% in region B, 27% in region C and 30% in 

region D. Regions in the top had 7% more frost than the ones in the bottom and regions in the 

periphery, near the wall, had 3% more frost than regions in the center. So most frost was 

formed in region D and the lowest was in region A. This result agrees with simulation results 

(Figure 4.16). The regions near the wall had more frost, but the volume is smaller, so total 

frost near the wall (regions B and D) was smaller than in region in the top and centered 

(region A). Another detail to take into account is that when the product nets were removed to 

measure frost, the frost layer next the container wall was detached and it was not quantified. 

The model predicted properly the more susceptible zones to frost formation into the container.

4.3. Parametric assessment 

Model parametric assessment was performed by changing one by one some parameters value 

and comparing temperature evolution and frost formation for cycle 1. Selected parameters 

were: permeability K, equivalent conductivity keq, convective heat transfer coefficient h 

between product and air into the container and effective mass diffusivity    , within a range 

from half to twice its reference value (Table 4.1).Results for product temperature at region are 

presented in Figure 4.19.

Figure 4.19 - Effect on product temperature at region A due to model parameter variation, for 

Cycle 1. 

As it can be seen in Figure 4.19, conductivity was the most sensitive parameter affecting 

significantly the predicted temperature evolution. This behavior was expected since 

conduction heat transfer was the most important phenomenon (temperature fields from Figure 

4.13 and Figure 4.14).Temperature rates were proportional to the equivalent conductivity. 

Convective heat transfer coefficient, permeability and mass diffusivity did not have any 

significant effect in temperature evolution. Next table summarizes these variations.

Figure 4.20 - Effect on total frost formation due to model parameter variation, for Cycle 1. 

In contrast to temperature, frost formation evolution depends significantly on all the 

parameters, but permeability. Frost formation increased with increasing convective coefficient 

or effective mass diffusivity while it decreased with equivalent conductivity of the porous 

media. The effect of each parameter was evaluated with the maximum variation defined as in 

equation (4.26) and presented in Table 4.8.

The effective mass diffusivity was the most important parameter, reaching a frost formation 

56% higher than the reference value during one day, followed by the convective coefficient 

with 26%. Finally, the condition varying both parameters simultaneously to twice of the 

reference value led to an increase in the frost formation of approximately twice the reference 

value.

Simulation results for all scenarios were smaller than the experimental value of            , 

but of the same order of magnitude. As it was discussed before, this model assumes constant 

effective mass diffusivity and in the reference case the dispersion term was ignored. On the 

other side, the convective heat transfer coefficient, from which the convective mass transfer 

coefficient was also deduced, was measured experimentally in one point into the container to 

have an order of magnitude, and was assume to be uniform and constant for the model. In this 

context, it was reasonable to consider that these values could be twice the reference value. 

Scenario 10 brought that condition and the obtained value was similar to the experimental 

one. 

5. Conclusion 

A simpler model of heat and mass transfer for a porous media and in conditions of free 

convection was developed. The model predicted product temperatures for different 

temperature cycles with deviations smaller than 12% for cycle 1 and 8% for cycle 2 in respect 

to experimental measurements. The model was a good tool to identify more susceptible 

regions for frost formation into the container. The rate of frost formation from the model 



91 
 

 
 

(           ) was lower than in the experiment (          ), but the order of magnitude 

was correct. Some of the identified parameter could be adjusted to obtain better results in 

terms of frost formation (           ). 

The importance of different parameters in the frost formation prediction was observed 

through a sensitivity study, which pointed out the role of the effective mass diffusivity and 

convective heat transfer coefficient.

5 CONCLUSION 

A model of heat and mass transfer was proposed in order to predict frost formation 

into a closed container filled with frozen vegetables. The problem was study as a macroporous 

media compose by the product and the surrounding air. Natural convection air flow was 

assumed into the container, who promotes water mass transport. The model was developed in 

the commercial software CFD COMSOL, and it was test imposing different exterior air 

temperature fluctuations (boundary conditions). Results of four temperature cycles were 

compared, varying one by one: average temperature, amplitude and frequency of oscillation. 

As general result it was observed that product temperature behavior is as expected, and it is 

directly associated with frost formation into the container. The bigger the product temperature 

variation, the bigger the amount of frost formed. Frost formation increase with large 

amplitude of oscillation, but decrease with higher frequencies and mean temperatures. 

Parameters that characterized the porous media were measure and identified for two 

porous media: slices of frozen carrots- air, and frozen green beans- air. Parameters can be 

classified in three types: the ones that depend only on thermophysical properties (product 

density and apparent specific heat), which depends only on the geometry (porosity, specific 

surface and permeability) and the ones which depends on both (equivalent conductivity and 

convective heat transfer coefficient). From the results, summarized in Table 3.5, it can be seen 

that parameters in the first case, were similar for both vegetables since they were compose 

mainly by water (carrots 87.79% and green beans 90.27%). Green beans density is 2% smaller 

than carrot density. Pure geometric parameters were of the same order of magnitude for both 

porous media, but were a bit bigger for green beans than for carrots. It was not strange since 

product geometries were completely different. Green beans porosity was 18% bigger, specific 

surface was 33% bigger and permeability was 14% bigger, respect to carrots. These results 

appear to be in concordance, since the biggest the porosity, the biggest the permeability. In 

case of the last two parameters, equivalent conductivity and convective heat transfer 

coefficient, the results were of the same order of magnitude. However, the equivalent 

conductivity varied more significantly, since it is directly related with the geometric 

appearance. As the porosity is smaller for carrots, there were more vegetables per bed volume, 

leading to a higher conductivity, and less air with lower conductivity. That situation explained 

the equivalent conductivity augmentation on 28.5% In the case of convective coefficient, 

differences in geometric characteristics appear not to have a large impact. Fluid (air) and solid 



95 
 

 
 

phases in porous media have similar thermal properties, and finally the convective 

coefficients were practically the same (7% higher for carrots bed). In general, parameters 

which characterize these porous media were similar for both products, even though the 

different geometries.   

A simpler model of heat and mass transfer for a porous media and in conditions of free 

convection was developed. The model predicted product temperatures for different 

temperature cycles with deviations smaller than 12% for cycle 1 and 8% for cycle 2 in respect 

to experimental measurements. The model was a good tool to identify more susceptible 

regions for frost formation into the container. The rate of frost formation from the model 

(           ) was lower than in the experiment (          ), but the order of magnitude 

was correct. Some of the identified parameter could be adjusted to obtain better results in 

terms of frost formation (           ). 

The importance of different parameters in the frost formation prediction was observed 

through a sensitivity study, which pointed out the role of the effective mass diffusivity and 

convective heat transfer coefficient.  

 

5.1 General conclusion and perspectives 

A model was developed to predict frost formation during the storage of a bulk of 

frozen vegetables. This model is a first step of the project Flexifroid, in order to create a tool 

for the industry to predict frost formation during normal storage conditions, or in cases of 

disconnection from the energy supply.  

This work would continue in different ways, in direction to a macroscopic study, 

improving the model and introducing it into a model of the air flow and heat exchange in the 

cold room, or microscopic study, analyzing recrystallization and frost densification. 

Some possible lines of work are summarized below: 

- Improve the model to consider recrystallization phenomena and frost densification. 

- Made a micro tomography in a small scale sample of the porous media, in order to 

understand the phenomena involved during the frost formation. 

- Validate the model changing to a cubic container (3D model) with real dimensions. 

- Implement a reduced model.
