RESUMO  

CEFERINO, G.E.U. Carbonatação acelerada: um estudo dos parâmetros, efeito da adição 

mineral, tipo de polpa celulósica e durabilidade em fibrocimento. 2016. 147 f. Tese

O processo de cura de carbonatação acelerada em matrizes cimentícias reforçadas com fibras 

naturais é um avanço no caminho para a inovação dos materiais compósitos adequados para 

aplicação nas regiões em desenvolvimento. No entanto, estudos adicionais, sobre o mecanismo 

da carbonatação em compósitos cimentícios reforçados com fibras naturais, conhecimento para 

a escolha do tipo de fibra celulósica, os parâmetros da câmara de carbonatação, a idade para 

começar o processo de cura com carbonatação, a influência da adição mineral e quantificar as 

fases hidratadas do cimento antes e depois do ensaio de envelhecimento acelerado, e o teste de 

durabilidade são ainda necessários. O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a definição de 

parâmetros opcionais para o processo de cura com carbonatação acelerada, identificar as 

principais fases hidratadas da matriz de cimento e a durabilidade do fibrocimento reforçado 

com polpa celulosica. As matérias-primas utilizadas para as formulações dos compósitos 

cimentícios usados nesta investigação incluem: cimento Portland, adição mineral (calcário ou 

sílica) e reforço de fibra natural (Eucalipto ou Pinus). Os compósitos cimentícios foram 

produzidas por um processo de sucção a vácuo da mistura e posterior prensagem em pequena 

escala em laboratório. As condições de cura foram conduzidas em vários conjuntos de amostras, 

que estudaram o efeito da concentração da carbonatação acelerada (0%, 20% e 

aproximadamente de 100% de CO2); o efeito de polpa celulósica (não branqueada e 

branqueada); o efeito da adição mineral (Calcário e Sílica) e, o efeito da durabilidade com o 

ensaio de envelhecimento acelerado (200 ciclos de imersão e secagem). Utilizou-se uma 

variedade de métodos de análise para avaliar a cinética de hidratação, as propriedades 

mecânicas e físicas e as implicações químicas nos compósitos; entre eles: difração de raios-X 

(DRX), análise termogravimétrica (TG e DTG), espectroscopia de infravermelho (FTIR), 

microscopia electrônica de varredura (MEV) e área superficial específica B.E.T. Nos 

compósitos sob concentrações perto do 100% de CO2, os resultados indicam que os compósitos 

reforçada com polpa branqueada apresentam nos ensaios de flexão valores médios 

estatisticamente significativos maiores do modulo de ruptura (MOR) e energia especifica ao 

redor do 24% comparados com os reforçados com polpa não branqueada. Nos compósitos sob 

concentrações 20% de CO2 os compósitos de sílica resultarem nos ensaios de flexão em valores 



médios estatisticamente significativos maiores no limite de proporcionalidade ao redor do 46% 

comparando com os compostos de calcário; O composto que utiliza sílica como adição mineral 

tem menor quantidade de hidróxido de cálcio (CH) em comparação com o composto com adição 

de calcário, com base no resíduo de CH detectado na análise de DRX: 3% e 11,5%, 

respectivamente. Após o envelhecimento acelerado, os compósitos com sílica sujeitos a dois 

regimes de cura diferentes (carbonatados e não carbonatados) não apresentam redução 

estatística do desempenho mecânico, com exceção da energia especifica; também há ausência 

de ettringite (AFt) no padrão XRD. Entretanto, os compósitos que foram sujeitos ao processo 

de carbonatação apresentam valores médios de MOR estatisticamente significativos mais 

elevados. Esta assim concluísse em este estudo que para compósitos cimentícios curados com 

carbonatação acelerada é indicado o uso de polpa branqueada com a sílica como adição mineral.

ABSTRACT 

CEFERINO, G.E.U. Accelerated carbonation: a study of the parameters, mineral addition 

effect, type cellulosic pulp and durability in fiber-cement. 2016. 147 p. Thesis (Doctorate) 

– Faculdade de Zootecnia e Engenharia de Alimentos, Universidade de São Paulo, 

Pirassununga, 2016. 

Carbonation accelerated curing process on cementitious matrices reinforced with vegetal fiber 

is an advance on the way for innovative composite materials suitable for application in 

developing regions. However, further studies on the carbonation mechanism in natural fiber 

reinforced cement composite, knowledge about the choice of cellulose fiber, carbonation 

chamber parameters, the age at which to begin the carbonation curing, the influence of mineral 

addition and the amount of the main hydrated clinker phases before and after of accelerated 

aging cycles, and durability test are still needed. The aim of this work was to evaluate the 

definition of optional parameters for accelerated carbonation curing process, the main hydrated 

phases of the cement matrix and the durability of fiber-cement reinforced with cellulose pulp. 

The raw materials used for the cementitious composite mix designs used in this investigation 

include: Portland cement, filler (limestone or silica) and natural fiber reinforcement (eucalyptus 

or pines). The cementitious composites were produced by a slurry vacuum dewatering process 

followed by pressing in laboratory small scale. The curing conditions were conducted on 

various sets of samples which were studied the effect of accelerated carbonation concentration 

(0%, 20% and close of 100% of CO2); the effect of cellulosic pulp (unbleached or bleached); 

the filler effect (limestone and silica); and, the effect of accelerated ageing test (200 soak &amp;amp; dry 

cycles). A variety of analytical test methods were used to assess the hydration kinetics, the 

mechanical and the physical properties, and chemical implications in the composites; between 

them: (X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TG and DTG), Infrared 

spectrometer (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and B.E.T. surface area analyzer. 

On the samples subject to close 100% of CO2 the results indicate that the bleached pulp 

reinforcement composites show in flexural test average statistically significant higher values of 

modulus rupture and specific energy around 24 % relating with unbleached pulp. On the 

samples subject to 20% CO2 the silica composite resulted in flexural test average statistically 

significant higher values of Limit of proportionality around 46% comparing with the limestone 

composite; the composite with silica addition presents less amount of calcium hydroxide (CH) 

in comparison with the composite with limestone addition, based on the CH residue detected in 

the XRD analysis: 3% and 11.5% respectively. After accelerated aging, the silica composites 



subject to two different curing regimes (carbonated and uncarbonated) presents no statistical 

reduction of mechanical performance, also there is an absence of ettringite (AFt) at XRD 

pattern; nevertheless, the carbonated composites present a significantly higher average MOR 

values. Thus, it is concluded in this study that for cementitious composites cured with 

accelerated carbonation the use of bleached pulp with silica as mineral addition is indicated.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Presently, the building materials industry is looking for eco-friendly alternatives to supply the 

increasing construction demand, not only in developing regions but all around the world 

(SAVASTANO et al., 2005). These studies indicate that natural resource based alternative 

materials should have a low production cost and minimal pollutant emissions, they should also 

be durable while having the lowest possible impact on the environment (SAVASTANO et al., 

2005; TONOLI et al., 2010; ARDANUY et al., 2015). Significant advances have already made, 

but more research and innovation are needed to find an ideal material that fits actual market 

requirements including environmental and accessibility concerns. 

The fiber-cement industry is particularly interested in the use of Natural waste fibers, including 

wood fibers. These are intriguing potential alternative materials, especially due to the extensive 

presence of plantations for these natural fibers (i.e. eucalyptus) reported in Brazil (ARDANUY 

et al., 2015); these materials exhibit a set of important advantages, such as wide availability at 

relatively low cost, biodegradability, and interesting physical and mechanical properties (low 

density and well-balanced stiffness). However, the low durability caused by degradation when 

exposed to an alkaline-mineral environment, has been an issue for fibers being used as 

reinforcement in various composites, like cementitious ones (ARDANUY et al., 2015; 

PICANÇO et al., 2008). 

The literature indicates that the process of carbonation can result in a number of benefits, such 

as improved durability, reduced alkalinity of the cement matrix, reduced open porosity percent, 

volume stabilization of the composite when exposed to humidity oscillation and strain gain. 

There are two categorized groups of carbonation processes: carbonation of mature cementitious 

matrices and carbonation of fresh cementitious composites. The first one is a phenomenon in 

which well-developed hydration products react with atmospheric CO2 through prolonged 

exposure, whereas in the second case carbonation is intentionally applied to fresh cement paste 

wherein CO2 reacts with the anhydrous phases and hydration products to form carbonates 

(FERNANDEZ-BERTOS et al., 2004; ROSTAMI et al., 2012). The accelerated curing process, 

when applied to the cementitious matrix, results in an initial reaction between hydration 

products (e.g. calcium hydroxide and C-S-H), anhydrous phases (e.g. C3S and C2S) and carbon 

dioxide in order to produce stronger composites (e.g. calcium carbonate) (FERNANDEZ-

BERTOS et al., 2004; SANTOS et al., 2015).

In natural fiber-cement, the curing process by accelerated carbonation has been identified as an 

effective procedure to mitigate the degradation of cellulose fibers, by improving mechanical 

behavior and volumetric stabilization of these composites. Furthermore, the carbonation 

process on cementitious composites leads to: decreased alkalinity of the cement matrix due to 

a lower content of Ca(OH)2, pore refinement, associated with the densification of the matrix 

through precipitation of CaCO3, which is a denser and more stable product than Ca(OH)2 

(PIZZOL et al., 2014; ALMEIDA et al., 2013, TONOLI et al., 2010). Previous studies on 

carbonation curing process in fiber-cement have highlighted that the relative humidity inside 

the CO2 chamber must be high and in proximity to 90% to allow the diffusivity of CO2 in the 

bulk (HOUST, 1996).  The effectiveness of the accelerated carbonation curing process in 

natural fiber-cement composites is affected by factors like the selection of the cellulosic pulp, 

the chamber parameters, and the mineral addition.    

A variety of carbonation curing conditions for cementing materials and also fiber composites 

have been reported in the literature, but typically ranging from 2 to 20% CO2 concentration 

with a wide range of combinations of pressure and temperature (LIWU et al., 2012). For 

example, Almeida et al. (2013) have studied carbonated cement based specimens reinforced 

with bleached eucalyptus pulp, the settings of climate chamber were 60°C temperature, 90% 

relative humidity (RH) and atmospheric CO2 concentration (15 vol%) for two days.  Pizzol et 

al. (2014) have studied the accelerated carbonation process in cement based specimens 

reinforced with bleached cellulosic pulp and synthetic fibers, the settings of climate chamber 

were 60°C temperature, 90% relative humidity (RH) and atmospheric CO2 concentration (15 

vol%) for ten hours. Santos et al., (2015) have studied the supercritical carbonation on extruded 

fibre-cement reinforced with bleached eucalyptus pulp and residual sisal chopped fibres, the 

specimens were placed into the chamber with total saturation (close of 100% concentration) of 

supercritical CO2 at 20 MPa and at 45°C in the chamber. 

Limestone is normally used in the industry as a mineral addition in cementitious matrices in 

order to reduce costs concerning the production of fiber-cement (BENTUR et al., 2007). Also, 

limestone was selected as mineral addition in the carbonated composites studied by Almeida et 

al. (2013), Pizzol et al. (2014) and Santos et al. (2015). Calcium carbonate filler (limestone), 

which even if inert materials blended with cement may have a significant effect on the hydration 

of the clinker phases (GUTTERIDGE et al., 1990), one those effects is the precipitation of 

CaCO3 (LOTHENBACH et al., 2008).  In addition, calcium carbonate is the principal reaction 

product of accelerated carbonation curing process at freshly cast cement, which could make

difficult analyze the quantification calcium carbonate formed along the accelerated carbonation 

curing process.  

Silica quartz is a neutral material, chemically and thermodynamically very stable at low 

temperatures (e.g. 45°C) and atmospheric pressure (FOURNIER AND ROWE, 1977; SINGH 

et al., 2013). Furthermore, the quartz used as filler does not react significantly and is nominally 

inert material, and gives more space for hydration product of the PC so the acceleration period 

is prolonged (LOPEZ, 2009; THOMAS et al., 2011). The use of quartz as the mineral addition 

in carbonated cementitious composites could be a strategy for isolating the carbonation process, 

in order to identify and estimate the amount of the main crystalline phases before and after of 

accelerated aging cycles.  

This introduction leaves clear that further studies on the carbonation mechanism in natural fiber 

reinforced cement composite, the choice of cellulose fiber, the mineral addition effect, the 

kinetic of hydration, the age at which to begin the carbonation curing, carbonation chamber 

parameters, and durability test are still needed.

1.4. Description of the thesis  

This study was development along five stages, follow describe: 

Stage 1: Literature review  

This stage describes the natural fiber-cement reinforcement, the structure of vegetable fibers, 

the cellulosic fibers, the fiber-cement production, the properties of cementitious materials 

reinforced with natural fibers, the durability, and finally introduces the fiber-cement curing with 

two processes: CO2 atmospheric curing process and atmospheric curing process.  

Stage 2: Definition of optimal parameters for supercritical carbonation process of 

vegetable fiber-cement composites at a very early age 

In vegetal fiber-cement, the curing process by accelerated carbonation has been identified as an 

effective procedure to mitigate the degradation of cellulose fibers, by reducing the pH of the 

bulk matrix and improving mechanical behavior and volumetric stabilization of these 

composites. Furthermore, the carbonation process on cementitious composites leads to: a 

decreased alkalinity of the cement matrix due to a lower content of Ca(OH)2, pore refinement, 

reduction to the average pore size, associated with the increased densification of the matrix 

through precipitation of CaCO3, which is a denser and more stable product than Ca(OH)2 

(PIZZOL et al., 2014; ALMEIDA et al., 2013, TONOLI et al., 2010). Previous studies on 

carbonation curing process in fiber-cements have highlighted that the relative humidity inside 

the CO2 chamber must be high and in proximity to 90% to allow the diffusivity of CO2 in the 

bulk (HOUST, 1996).   

The concentrations of CO2 influence the carbonation rate of cement composites. Carbonation 

reaction could be slow with atmospheric CO2 concentration levels (0.03%– 0.04%), while in 

accelerated curing, the concentration of CO2 in a chamber is typically 2%–20% and if 

supercritical CO2 methods are used there is a greatly accelerated curing process with 

concentrations close to 100%. In natural conditions, complete carbonation of engineering-sized 

components takes years instead of hours in laboratory conditions. In general, increasing CO2 

concentration and pressure facilitates diffusion processes and the dissolution of CO2, thus high-

density scCO2 eases the penetration into the cement paste pore network or complex pores 

typical for fiber–cement matrices (SANTOS et al., 2015; GARCÍA et al., 2006; CHANG et al., 

2006; FARAHI et al., 2013; LIWU et al., 2012).

The aim of the aim of the stage 2 is to study the influence of: the bleaching of eucalyptus 

cellulose pulp, the initial curing duration, the CO2 exposure time and accelerated aging cycles, 

on natural fiber-cement composites subjected to supercritical carbonation at a very early age.  

All samples of the composites were subjected to mechanical, physical, and microstructural tests. 

 

Stage 3: Comparative study of two kinds of mineral addition in cellulose pulp fiber-

cement composites subjected to accelerated carbonation at early age. 

Limestone is normally used in the industry as a mineral addition in cementitious matrices in 

order to reduce costs concerning the production of fiber-cement (BENTUR et al., 2007). Also, 

limestone was selected as mineral addition in the carbonated cementitious composites studied 

by Almeida et al., (2013); Pizzol et al., (2014) and Santos et al., (2015). The use of limestone 

with Portland Cement PC, it is being reported the high affinity between calcium aluminate and 

carbonate phases to form monocarbonate. Also, at the initial hydration heat evolution indicating 

a slight acceleration of the cement hydration in the presence of finely ground calcite 

(FELDMAN et al., 1965; BENSTED, 1980; LOTHENBACH et al., 2008). Silica quartz type 

is a neutral material, chemically and thermodynamically stable at low temperatures (e.g. 45°C) 

and atmospheric pressure (FOURNIER AND ROWE, 1977; SINGH et al., 2013). 

Additionally, the quartz used as filler in a mix design with PC, it does not react significantly, is 

an inert material due the crystalline characteristic and gives more space to the particle 

distribution for hydration product of the PC so the acceleration period is prolonged, compare 

with 100% PC after mixing (LOPEZ, 2009; THOMAS et al., 2011). The use of quartz as 

mineral addition in carbonated cementitious composites could be a strategy for isolating the 

carbonation process, in order to identify and estimate the amount of the main crystalline phases.  

In addition, calcium carbonate is the principal reaction product of accelerated carbonation 

curing process at freshly cast cement, which could make difficult to analyze and quantify the 

calcium carbonate formed along the accelerated carbonation curing process. 

Carbonated natural fiber-cement composites using two kinds of mineral addition could have 

different: (i) mechanical behaviour, (ii) microstructure and (iii) amount of phases. The aim of 

the stage 3 is compare two kind of mineral addition (limestone v. ground silica) and the initial 

curing duration (10 h v. 24 h), on natural fiber-cement composites subjected to accelerated 

carbonation curing process at a very early age.  All samples of the composites were subjected 

to mechanical, physical, and microstructural tests.

Stage 4: Durability and hydration kinetics study in carbonated fiber-cement composites 

using silica as a mineral addition. 

Worldwide cellulose fibers are extensively available, have many varieties and also are a 

renewable source, which makes for an attractive concept to be used in composite building 

materials. The mechanical performance of these composites at early ages was deemed to be 

satisfactory, however, in the presence of moisture and alkalinity above (pH 8.5), the wood fibres 

swell, and chemically degrade as a result of mineralization processes which in turn adversely 

affects the mechanical properties, namely strength and stiffness of the composite matrix. As 

well it is affected the long-term performance after natural or accelerated ageing (e.g. wet/ dry 

cycling); it is adverse for the strength and toughness of the composite (MOHR et al., 2005; 

MOHR et al., 2007; BENTUR et al., 2007; TONOLI et al., 2009; DAI et al., 2014).   

In Natural Fiber-cement, the curing process by accelerated carbonation has been identified as 

an effective procedure to mitigate the long-term degradation of cellulose fibers, by reducing the 

pH of the bulk matrix and improving mechanical behavior and volumetric stabilization of these 

composites. Furthermore, the carbonation process on cementitious composites leads to a 

decreased alkalinity of the cement matrix due to a lower content of Ca(OH)2, pore refinement, 

reduction to the average pore size, associated with the increased densification of the matrix 

through precipitation of CaCO3, which is a denser and more stable product than Ca(OH)2 

(PIZZOL et al., 2014; ALMEIDA et al., 2013, TONOLI et al., 2010). 

Fast carbonation curing is beneficial for accelerating the plastic shrinkage of the composite, and 

avoiding dimensional instability of the composite in the initial ages and during the lifetime. 

These studies also show the improvement of mechanical properties after the Accelerated Aging 

Cycles, as an evidence that the cement matrix improves its performance with the carbonation 

curing process at early ages and with the progress of the cement hydration process (ALMEIDA 

et al., 2013). 

As was previously mentioned at stage three silica quartz type is a neutral material, chemically 

and thermodynamically stable at low temperatures (e.g. 45°C) and atmospheric pressure 

(FOURNIER AND ROWE, 1977; SINGH et al., 2013). Additionally, the quartz used as filler 

in a mix design with OPC, it does not react significantly, is an inert material; due the crystalline 

characteristic of the quartz, so gives more space to the particle distribution for hydration product 

of the OPC so the acceleration period is prolonged, if it is compared with a mix with 100%

Portland cement (LOPEZ, 2009; THOMAS et al., 2011). The use of quartz as a mineral addition 

in carbonated cementitious composites could be a strategy for isolating the carbonation process, 

in order to identify and estimate the amount of the main crystalline phases before and after of 

accelerated aging cycles. Also, for know about the mechanical properties after the Accelerated 

Aging Cycles. 

The use of quartz as a mineral addition in carbonated cementitious composites could be a 

strategy for isolating the carbonation process, in order to identify and estimate the amount of 

the main crystalline phases before and after of accelerated aging cycles. Also, the use of silica 

as a mineral addition in carbonate fiber-cement composite there is not knowledge about the 

mechanical properties behaviour after the Accelerated Aging Cycles. 

The use of silica as a mineral addition in carbonated composites could allow discussing in this 

stage: (i) the effect of initial hydration; (ii) the identification of the main phases; (iii) the 

carbonation effect and (iv) the durability. The aim of stage four is to study the durability and 

the hydration kinetics in carbonated composites reinforced with unbleached pines cellulose pulp 

fiber and use silica as a mineral addition. Composites were subjected to mechanical, physical, 

and microstructural tests. 

 

Stage 5: Evolution of the hydration kinetics on unbleached cellulose pulp fiber-cement 

composites subjected to accelerated carbonation at early age 

As was mentioned in stage 3 and stage 4, Limestone is normally used in the industry as a mineral 

addition in cementitious matrices in order to reduce costs concerning the production of fiber-

cement (BENTUR et al., 2007). Also, limestone was selected as the mineral addition in the 

carbonated cementitious composites studied by Almeida et al. (2013), Pizzol et al. (2014) and 

Santos et al. (2015). According with Tonoli et al. (2016), the main phases identified in the X-

ray diffraction patterns of the control uncarbonated and carbonated cementitious composites 

are: calcite (CaCO3); vaterite (Va); aragonite (Ar); monosulfoaluminate (AFm); ettringite (Aft); 

portlandite (P); monocarboaluminate (Mc); tricalcium aluminate (C3A); tetracalcium 

aluminoferrite (C4AF); belite (C2S) and alite (C3S). 

Previously mentioned, silica quartz type is a neutral material, chemically and 

thermodynamically very stable at low temperatures (e.g. 45°C) and at atmospheric pressure 

(FOURNIER AND ROWE, 1977; SINGH et al., 2013). The use of silica type quartz as a 

mineral addition in carbonated cementitious composites could be a strategy for isolating the 



 

 

 

24 

 

carbonation process, in order to identify the main crystalline phases along the 10 h carbonation 

process and to study the carbonation kinetic hydration at early edge.  

The use of silica as a mineral addition in carbonated composites could allow discussing 

following subjects: (i) the carbonation kinetic hydration along 10 h; (ii) the identification of the 

main phases and (iii) the microstructure at early edges. The aim of stage 5 is to study the kinetic 

hydration in carbonated at early edge unbleached pines cellulose pulp fiber-cement composites 

that use silica as a mineral addition. For looking into the kinetic hydration, for each condition 

two samples were removed from the chamber each hour running the carbonation curing process. 

Then the samples were immersed in acetone, in order to interrupt the hydration of the 

cementitious matrix. Also, a small piece of the sample was cut for adding the phenolphthalein 

indicator and checking the status of the internal surface, according to the intensity of the color 

displayed by the indicator.  All samples of the composites were subjected to microstructural 

tests.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW 

As previously mentioned in section 1.4. this stage makes an introduction of the natural fiber-

cement reinforcement, the structure of vegetable fibers, the cellulosic fibers, the fiber-cement 

production, the properties of cementitious materials reinforced with natural fibers and the 

durability, finally introduce the fiber-cement curing process with two processes: CO2 

atmospheric curing process and atmospheric curing process. The first one curing process 

mentioned was considered a treatment to improve the mechanical properties of this kind of 

composites, even through many variables or factors could be affected the effectiveness of this 

treatment.  

2.2. Natural Fiber-cement reinforcement  

Since the early 1940s, many studies have investigated the concept of vegetal fiber reinforcement 

in cement-based materials as a potential substitute for asbestos fibers. Since then, the potential 

applications of VF cement composites have grown, especially with regards to thin walled 

materials: mainly thin-sheet products for partitions, building envelopes or ceiling flat sheets; 

roofing tiles and premanufactured components in general (ROMA et al., 2008). Other reasons 

for the increased interest in vegetable fiber integration with building materials, include their 

decreasing pressures for the dependence on the building materials industry to use petroleum 

based products (e.g. synthetic fibers), with increasing interest in the use of renewable resources 

(e.g. cellulosic fibers), and variety of morphologies and aspect ratios (PICANÇO et al., 2008; 

SATYANARAYANA et al., 2009; TONOLI et al., 2009).  

According to regional statistical yearbooks of 2014 from the Food and Agriculture Organization 

of the United Nations (FAO) (FAO Statistical Yearbooks – World food and agriculture 2014), 

the land and forestry report in 2011 estimates forest and fibers areas to be 517.3 million ha and 

1.7 ha, respectively. Table 1 shows the classification of tropical region vegetal fibers:

2.2.1. Structure of vegetable fibers 

Cellulose is the most abundant and biodegradable natural polymer that exists on planet earth, it 

is the principal fiber reinforcement of wood, non-wood plants, seaweeds and some bacteria 

(LAVOINE et al., 2012). The structure of an individual wood cell is composed mainly of long, 

oriented cellulose molecules, with a degree of polymerization of ?25,000. The cellulose 

molecule chains are grouped in long, oriented microfibril units having a thickness of about 0.7 

mm and a length of a few ?m. The other components of the cell wall, hemicellulose, and lignin, 

have much lower degrees of polymerization and are located mainly in the middle lamellae 

which connects the individual fiber cells together (BENTUR AND MINDESS, 2007; 

CORREIA, 2015). 

Four different polymorphs of cellulose are known, named cellulose I, II, III, and IV. Cellulose 

I is the form found in nature and it occurs in two allomorphs I? and I?. Cellulose II is the 

crystalline form more stable and also emerges after re-crystallization with aqueous sodium 

hydroxide, and it is the thermodynamically most stable crystalline form. Cellulose II and 

cellulose I have antiparallel and parallel packing, respectively. Cellulose III is obtained by a 

liquid ammonia treatment of cellulose I, and cellulose IV is a result of heating cellulose III, the 

transformation usually being only partial (AULIN, 2009; CORREIA, 2015).  Figure 1 shows 

how cellulose is present in nature. Inattentive of its source, cellulose is a white fiber-like 

structure with no smell and has a density of around 1.5 g/cm³ (LAVOINE et al., 2012).

The sorption isotherm of cellulosic material depends on the purity of cellulose and the degree 

of crystallinity. There are many hydroxyl (OH) groups in cellulose, which in amorphous phase 

are accessible to water and available for interaction. They interact with water not only at the 

surface but also in the bulk. But, there are significant problems of compatibility between the 

fiber and cementitious composite, which weakens interface areas between natural fibers and 

matrices (THOMAS et al., 2011; SHALWAN et al., 2013). TONOLI et al., 2009 reported that 

with a proper alkaline treatment, cement composites with vegetable fibers previously submitted 

to surface modification with methacryloxypropyltri-methoxysilane (MPTS) show fibers free 

from cement hydration products, reducing their hydrophilic character and improving their 

adhesion. 

The diminution of the moisture absorption and the surface modification of fibers may also 

increase tensile properties of the fibers and also the strength properties of biodegradable 

composites, keeping in mind the composition and structure of lignocellulosic fibers. In 

considering the applicability of cellulose fibers to cement reinforcement, lignin is an amorphous 

chemical species susceptible to dissolution in an alkaline medium such as a cement matrix 

(COUTTS et al., 2005; AGOPYAN et al., 2005; TONOLI et al., 2009; SATYANARAYANA 

et al., 2009). 

Lignin and hemicellulose have one characteristic in common: sensitivity to the alkaline 

environment, which means that they easily undergo the alkaline hydrolysis of cellulose 

molecules in the highly alkaline cementitious matrix due to the high calcium hydroxide content. 

For increasing the durability of vegetable fibers, it is research through modifying the fibers with 

impregnation, treatments, and fibrillation; to minimize the degradation at fiber-cement 

composites during wetting and drying cycles. (BENTUR AND MINDESS, 2007; MOHR et al.,

2007; PACHECO-TORGAL et al., 2011; ALMEIDA et al., 2013; ARDANUY et al., 2015; 

WEI et al., 2015).  

2.2.1.1. Cellulosic fibers  

Cellulosic fibers can be obtained from timber, by chemical, mechanical, biological processes, 

and many combined processes. They are classified by their length and form: macroscopic level 

(normally 0.1–1 m), mesoscopic level (normally 1–10 mm), microscopic level (normally 0.01–

6 mm) and ultrastructural level (normally 1–25 µm) (ARDANUY et al., 2015; DAI et al., 2014). 

At the microscopic level, two kinds of wood cells have different hierarchical structures: 

softwood fibers (pines, firs, etc.) and hardwood fibers (the birch tree, eucalyptus, beech, etc.). 

Both kinds of fibers are non-hazardous, renewable and widely available. The differences 

between softwood and hardwood fibers are the high price of the former and the faster growing 

plantations of the latter in tropical countries. The VF in previous decades received the attention 

to be used as replacement for hazardous asbestos fibers. The VF is a reinforcing material that 

today is found in products such as extruded non-pressure pipes and non-structural building 

materials, mainly thin-sheet products (MOHR et al., 2005; PIZZOL, 2013; DAI et al., 2014; 

ARDANUY et al., 2015). 

At the ultrastructural level, the wood fibers are built up of four layers.  These are M (middle 

lamella), the P (primary cell wall) containing cellulose microfibrils, the S (secondary wall) and 

W (warty layer). The secondary wall is composed of three separate and distant layers – S1 (outer 

layer of the secondary wall), S2 (middle layer of the secondary wall) and S3 (inner layer of the 

secondary wall). S2 layer is the thickest and the most important in determining mechanical 

properties (THOMAS et al., 2011; DAI et al., 2014). Inside microfibril containing regions, 

networks contain organized structure (crystalline) and loose structure (amorphous). At 

crystalline regions, the network interactions and molecular orientations could change, given 

origin to polymorph and allomorph (CORREIA, 2015). 

Cellulosic fibers provide adequate stiffness, strength and bonding capacity to cement-based 

matrices, so they have been extensively applied as the sole reinforcing element in commercial 

autoclaved and air-cured Portland cement products, because of the retention of cellulose fibers 

particles on the Hatschek process (CORREIA et al., 2014; WEI et al., 2015).

2.2.2. Fiber-cement production 

The current worldwide production cellulosic Fiber-cement, in conjunction with polyvinyl 

alcohol (PVA) fibers for air-cured (non-autoclaved) products, is located in United States of 

America, Europe, Oceania and Asia. Brazil has 17 cement plants in ten Brazilian states, offering 

five thousand jobs and producing 1.3 million tons per year (PIZZOL, 2013).  

The Hatschek process was patented by Hatschek in 1900. It consists of producing fiber cement 

sheets by stacking thin laminas made from a suspension of cement, fibers, mineral admixtures 

and water, in a process that resembles the production of paper. The first step of the process is 

preparing the slurry, the mixture of adequate proportions of solid materials (i.e. water, cement, 

cellulose fibers, and limestone filler) by a roller from a tank under continuous agitation. The 

slurry is then transported to the vats with sieve cylinders where wet solid material is deposited 

and then removing, thus, forming a green lamina. Using a vacuum system, a significant portion 

of the mixing water is removed from the slurry, forming a very thin sheet (about 1 mm). Finally, 

the fresh sheet is cut, shaped (corrugated sheets and accessories) and submitted to curing under 

air or steam conditions -autoclave-. Hatschek machines were designed to produce homogeneous 

materials, so these processes produce composites with an adequate percentage of fibers well 

dispersed into the matrix (DIAS et al., 2010; ARDANUY et al., 2015).

fiber cement and P is a final product.

At laboratory scale, the specimens are made using a slurry-dewatering process followed by a 

pressing technique, as a similar reproduction of the Hatschek process used in the industrial 

production of fiber cement (SAVASTANO et al., 2000). Figure 3 shows the Schematic drawing 

with the respective stages.

2.2.3. Properties of cementitious materials reinforced with vegetal fibers 

The majority of studies about the mechanical behavior of specimens of cement composites 

prepared at laboratory analyze their mechanical properties using both the three-point and four-

point bending configurations. Those are employed to evaluate the limit of proportionality (LOP), 

modulus of rupture (MOR), modulus of elasticity (MOE) and specific energy (SE). The standard TFR1 

of RILEM recommends a proportion between the maximum distance between supports and the 

thickness of the specimen higher than 20 (TONOLI et al., 2013; ARDANUY et al., 2015).  

The tensile strength, void content and interfacial adhesion of the composite is influence by 

optimum fiber volume fraction of natural fibers and type of fiber. The effects of fiber content 

on strength show a maximum in the range of 8–12% by mass. Comparing a composite with 

fiber compare without fibers, both subjected to mechanical stress, the crack is going to be 

greater magnitude through is not reinforced by fibers. In Figure 4 shows schematic 

representation composite flexural behavior: (a) without fibers, (b) with fiber reinforced (c) 

crack detail through the reinforced composite fibers: (1) and (2) bridging and detachment of the 

fiber; (3) pullout fiber; (4) disruption of fiber (BENTUR AND MINDESS, 2007; PIZZOL, 

2013; SHALWAN et al., 2013).

Beyond the optimum fiber content, the detrimental effect due to the porosity increase is greater 

than the reinforcing influence of the added fiber. Porosity inside cement composite is influenced 

at the early edge by the curing process and by climatic conditions. The total initial porosity of 

cement paste depends on by relations between temperature, paste composition and mineralogy. 

The amount of porosity could be increased by rising cure temperatures, the alteration, and 

solubility of AFt, the evaporation of water excess and gasses from the outside into the inside of 

the cement material. Furthermore, depending on weather, the pore network may be dry, semi-

saturated and saturated. This porosity is one of the causes of the lack of durability of the cement 

pastes (BENTUR AND MINDESS, 2007; MATSCHEI et al., 2010; ARDANUY et al., 2015).  

Cellulosic fiber-cement reinforcement presents a satisfactory mechanical performance at early 

ages, but the wood fibers swell in the presence of moisture or water and high alkalinity of the 

cementitious matrix cause a chemical degradation and negatively influenced of stiffness and 

strength (ARDANUY et al., 2015). 

Attempts have been made to optimize the properties of the composites by changing the fiber 

content and their quality, through modifications in the pulping process as well as by surface 

treatments to enhance fiber–matrix interactions. The evaluation of the reinforcing effects is 

usually determined by testing composites made in a full-scale Hatschek process or used a 

variation of the process (the slurry vacuum de-watering technique) (BENTUR AND 

MINDESS, 2007; CORREIA et al., 2014; DAI et al., 2014). 

2.2.4. Durability  

The industrial production of cement-based composites reinforced with VF is currently limited 

by the long-term durability of these air-cured composites due to the deterioration caused by 

several mechanisms associated with the environment (i.e. natural weathering, sulphate or 

chloride attack, etc.) and inside the composite (i.e. alkali attack, fiber mineralization, and 

volume variation). The following sequence of degradation occurs in the vegetable fibers when 



 

 

 

32 

 

the composite is subjected to various wet/dry cycles: (a) loss of adherence between the fiber 

and the matrix; (b) reprecipitation of the hydrated compounds within the void space at the 

former fiber–cement interface; (c) full mineralization, and thus the embrittlement of the 

vegetable fibers. After the post-cracking, this causes the material to have a reduction in strength 

and toughness (BENTUR AND MINDESS, 2007; PACHECO-TORGAL et al., 2011; 

ALMEIDA et al., 2013; ARDANUY et al., 2015; WEI et al., 2015). 

The swelling and shrinking of the fibers during wetting and drying, with strains greater than 

those of the matrix, may lead to changes in the contact pressure across the interface, thus 

causing variations in the actual bond. A proper fibre–matrix interaction depends on the 

availability of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the cellulose are the prime means by which 

fibers and cement bond together, also influence the cellulose-pulp fiber failure. Improving the 

fibre-matrix bond too much will lead to the composite becoming too brittle and susceptible to 

movement cracking in service (COUTTS AND KIGHTLY, 1984; COUTTS, 2005; BENTUR 

AND MINDESS, 2007). 

In a highly alkaline cementitious matrix, the harsh hydrolysis of the hemicellulose and lignin 

causes molecular chains to divide and decreases the degree of polymerization due to the greater 

amount of calcium hydroxide, that reprecipitation is a dominant step in kraft pulp fiber-cement 

composite degradation during wet-dry cycling. The migration of alkaline hydration products to 

lumens and to the middle lamella, caused a volume variation in these fibers due their high-water 

absorption, also produce fiber mineralization by be sensitive to the amount of CH in the matrix 

(BENTUR AND MINDESS, 2007; MOHR et al., 2007; WEI et al., 2015). 

Many authors have reported fiber mineralization as a source of degradation which leads to fiber 

embrittlement and the reduction of strength and strain capacity. The CH-mineralization is a 

mechanism of degradation of the fiber due to the CH content of the matrix and deleterious effect 

of Ca2+ elements. The degradation of cellulose can be simply generalized as the disconnection 

of discrete cellulose nanocrystals caused by decomposition of reducing ends (feature original 

C4- OH) in amorphous regions. The accelerated carbonation curing process is projected to 

decrease the amount of calcium hydroxide in cement-based composites, as well as lower the 

pH and porosity, and minimize the degradation of the fiber (SILVA, 2002; PACHECO-

TORGAL et al., 2011; MOHR et al., 2007; WEI et al., 2015). 

Some researchers have revealed that the long term integrity of the vegetable fibre–cement 

composite matrix may be compromised upon exposure to environmental conditions such as 



 

 

 

33 

 

moisture (SAVASTANO et al., 1999; MOHR et al., 2007; TONOLI et al., 2009). One potential 

strategy to reduce the vulnerability of vegetable fibre-cement composites to degradation over 

the long term is to use fibre–cement composed of Portland cement, finely ground crystalline 

silica, and cellulose fibre which are autoclaved to a specified strength, durability and 

dimensional stability (COUTTS et al., 1995; COOKE et al., 2000). In addition to the autoclave 

process, carbonation curing of fresh cementitious composites is reported to also reduce the 

vulnerability of the degradation of cellulose fibres since carbonation reduces the pH of the bulk 

matrix leading to less fibre degradation which is beneficial for the mechanical behaviour, 

microstructure and improves the plastic shrinkage (ALMEIDA et al., 2010; TONOLI et al., 

2010; PIZZOL et al., 2014; BERTOS et al., 2004; SANTOS et al., 2015). 

2.3.  Fiber-cement composites curing process    

2.3.1. CO2 atmospheric curing process  

Cementitious composites are well known to be reactive with carbon dioxide. There are two 

ways this carbonation reaction occurs: carbonation of mature cementitious matrices and 

carbonation of fresh cementitious composites. The first one is a phenomenon in which well-

developed hydration products react with atmospheric CO2 through prolonged exposure and the 

second case carbonation is intentionally applied to freshly cement paste where in CO2 reacts 

with the anhydrous phases to form strength contributing hydrates and carbonate (ALMEIDA et 

al., 2013; ROSTAMI et al., 2012).  

Complete carbonation of engineering-sized components in natural conditions can take years 

instead hours like a laboratory conditions, due concentrations of CO2 influence the carbonation 

rate of cement composites. Carbonation reaction could be slow with atmospheric CO2 

concentration (0.03%–0.04%), while in accelerated curing carbonation in a chamber is typically 

used 2%–20% concentration of CO2 and with supercritical CO2 is greatly accelerated curing 

process with rate close 100%. In general, increasing CO2 concentration and pressure ease 

diffusion processes and the dissolution of CO2 (GARCIA-GONZALEZ et al., 2006; CHANG 

et al., 2006; LIWU et al., 2012; FARAHI et al., 2013).  

Reinforced concrete has a highly alkaline medium (pH 13), to cement present; giving to steel a 

passive protection oxide film. On service is exposed to atmospheric carbon dioxide, CO2 

diffuses through the unsaturated pores. This reaction generates shrinkage, reduced sorptivity, 

decreased water permeability and reduces the pH value in the environment of the reinforcement, 

induced steel corrosion of steel reinforcing bars. Consequently, the oxidizing affected the 



 

 

 

34 

 

durability of the structure (FERNÁNDEZ-BERTOS et al., 2004; PETER et al., 2008; 

ROSTAMI et al., 2011; ROSTAMI et al., 2012).  

Carbonation accelerated curing process at freshly cast cement paste, cured concrete and fiber 

composites, is extensive reported that shown to offer improved mechanical and durability 

properties (PETER et al., 2008; ROSTAMI et al., 2012). Furthermore, in vegetal Fiber-cement 

composites submitted to an accelerated carbonation test has been identified as effective 

procedure to mitigate the degradation of cellulose fibers and to improve mechanical behaviour 

and volumetric stabilization of these composites (ALMEIDA et al., 2013; SANTOS et al., 

2015).  

Therefore, a minimum content of water is essential for the ionization of compounds to promote 

the reaction of carbonation, but a large amount of water (i.e. saturated pores) limits the reaction 

due to the blockage of the pores (ALMEIDA et al., 2013). Independent of the concentration of 

CO2 the chemical reaction is similar in that the carbon dioxide diffuses into the capillary pores 

of the cementitious composites and combines with aqueous phase in the pores, forming carbonic 

acid (H2CO3) that dissociates into carbonate (HCO3 and CO3). Once carbon dioxide dissolves 

reacts with hydration products, such as calcium hydroxide (CH) and calcium silicate hydrate 

(C–S–H), forming CaCO3 by the combination of moist CO2 with Ca
2+ and silica gel, the follow 

equations shows the process (Eqs. (1)–(2)) (FERNÁNDEZ-BERTOS et al., 2004; ROSTAMI 

et al., 2012; ALMEIDA et al., 2013; FARAHI et al., 2013): 

 

Ca (OH)2 + CO2 ? CaCO3 + H2O            (Eq.   1) 

C-S-H + 2CO2 ? SiO2 + 2CaCO3 + H2O    (Eq.   2) 

 

Another way to explain the interaction between carbon dioxide and hydrated Portland cement 

at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature conditions is through the Figure 5.

cement.

Carbonation of Ca(OH)2 into CaCO3 causes an increase of volume, depending on the crystal 

form, which is 3% for aragonite, 12% for calcite and 19% for vaterite. Calcite is the stable form 

under normal temperature and pressure and is the principal kind of calcium carbonate formed 

by carbonation (HOUST, 1996).  

Accelerated carbonation curing process model must consider the kinetic and thermodynamic 

parameters that influence the equilibrium of each phase and the interaction thereof. 

Consequently, the dissolution and precipitation of chemical compounds or ionic equilibrium 

with carbonation process vary with the temperature, ionic strength and pH solution (TONOLI 

et al., 2010; MATSUSHITA et al., 2004; CHEN et al., 2007; BULLARD et al., 2011). 

 

2.3.1.1. Influenced by the relative humidity on Carbonation reaction  

The diffusivity of gases in cementitious composites is influenced by the porosity, the cement 

content, the kinetic hydration, the water to cement ratio, etc. It was found that the effective 

diffusivity of CO2 does not depend on the CO2 concentration. The effective diffusivity of carbon 

dioxide is a function of the relative humidity, this is due to the large reduction of the equilibrium 

water content caused by carbonation. At the cementitious composite the porosity needs to 

consists of micro- and meso-pores where water can adsorb and condense. Consequently, the 

porous volume allowing gas diffusion is reduced. In non-carbonated materials the influence of 

humidity is much lower (HOUST, 1996). 



 

 

 

36 

 

According to Fernandez-Bertos et al. 2004, the water content affects the reaction of CO2, 

because it is essential for the solvation and hydration of the carbon dioxide. It dissolves the Ca2+ 

ions from the solid that will in turn react to form the CaCO3. Subsequently, it influences the 

amount of product generated, which is also related to the development of strength. 

For conventional concrete, it has been well reported that the occurrence of carbonation reactions 

is most likely between 40% and 80% relative humidity. Various researchers have used a range 

of 65% to 70% relative humidity in accelerated laboratory carbonation chambers for tests on 

conventional cement (CHANG et al., 2006; SISOMPHON et al., 2007; SULAPHA et al., 2003). 

However, accelerated carbonation chambers for cement-based materials containing reactive 

MgO are more effective at a higher relative humidity (i.e. 98%) (LIWU et al., 2012). On cement 

pastes samples exposed to a highly carbonating environment with pure carbon dioxide at 90 % 

relative humidity, was chosen as it has been observed that the hydration of the cement is very 

slow, but the carbonation rate is high at this humidity (HOUST, 1996; YLMÉN et al., 2013; 

ALMEIDA et al., 2013; PIZZOL et al., 2014).  

2.3.2. Hydration of Portland cement curing process 

The hydration of Portland cement consists of the reaction of its phases with water, through an 

exothermic reaction, which transform the cement fluid mix and water into a solid phase 

(PEREIRA, 2012). Chemical processes, the effect of curing conditions, equilibrium solubility, 

rate of dissolution, and other aspects involve understanding hydration process during the 

different periods. A way to simplify the explanation, is to isolate and study the individual rate 

processes that govern cement hydration (BULLARD et al., 2011). 

C3S/alite constitutes between 50% and 80% of Portland cement and dominates the development 

of properties (SCRIVENER et al., 2011). So it is clear why many studies discuss the hydration 

of the Portland cement clinker, focusing on the three main periods of reaction of alite/C3S: 

 

• Up to the end of the induction period (about 3 h)  

• Main heat evolution peak (approx. 3–24 h), including impact of mineral additions 

• Continuing reaction after 1 day (particularly from 1 to 28 days) 

 



 

 

 

37 

 

The induction period is characterized by fast reactions between C3S and water that starts 

immediately upon wetting, characterized by a large exothermic signal in isothermal calorimetry 

experiments (COSTOYA, 2008). There are many reasons why there is little growth of C-S-H 

through the induction period, like the degree of hydration at the end of the induction period is 

only around 2–4%. As soon as the precipitation of product happens, the concentration of Ca in 

solution increases, eventually up to around 35 to 40 ?mol, at the end of the induction period 

(BROWN et al., 1984). In parallel the concentration of silicate drops dramatically to the ?mol 

range. Thus, the rate of dissolution of C3S becomes very slow as the solution is supersaturated 

with respect to calcium hydroxide (SCRIVENER et al., 2015). 

At the end of the induction period C–S–H and Portlandite begin to grow rapidily. Bazzoni et al. 

2014, propose that the kinetics along the principal heat evolution peak are controlled by the 

growth of C–S–H “needles”. The needles nucleate on the surface of particles and, those properly 

oriented, grow outwards. Thus, calcium hydroxide does not precipitate during the induction 

period, there are two possible mechanisms (BULLARD et al., 2010): either the presence of an 

inhibiting layer, or the “geochemical” approach.  In addition, a modeling program HydratiCA 

showed that in the second case an inhibition of the nucleation or growth of Portlandite (without 

impacting the other reactions) would produce retardation (SCRIVENER et al., 2015).  

The hydration kinetics beyond one day include two relevant processes: first, from 1 to 6 days 

the quantity of hydration seems to be principally determined by the water to cement ratio or the 

space available for the cement hydrates. After about 6 days all the systems seem to have very 

similar kinetics. Second, the period 1–28 days is of great practical importance as 75% of the 

design strength may develop during this period. The heat evolution rate is very low after 28 

days of hydration process (SCRIVENER et al., 2011; SCRIVENER et al., 2015).  

Isothermal conduction calorimetry (Figure 6) indicates the onset of the acceleration period at 

approx. 3h in PC (Portland cement without limestone addition) and PC4 (Portland cement with 

limestone addition). The maximal heat evolution of the cement hydration was slight accelerated 

in the presence of finely ground calcite (PC4). Due to the nucleation and growth of hydration 

products (STARK, 2004; PERA et al., 1999).

Figure 7 shows the rate of heat evolution as a function of the clinker phases for 3 systems: a 

pure Portland system, a blend of the same Portland with 40% quartz (inert) and a blend with 

40% slag. For the first 28 h the curves for the blends with quartz and slag are essentially the 

same, confirming that the reaction of slag itself is not occurring in this period. Nevertheless, 

when the rate of heat evolution is normalized relative to the clinker component (in this case) it 

is clear that the slag and quartz enhance the reaction of the clinker component due to their 

physical presence; this is named the mineral addition effect (SCRIVENER et al., 2015).

2.4. Mineral addition effect  

The mineral addition effect can be attributed to two main aspects.  First, when supplementary 

cementitious material particles substitute Portland Cement particles, as illustrated in Figure 8, 

there is comparatively more space available for the hydrates of the clinker phases to form in. 

Secondly, the surface of the SCM particles act as sites for the heterogeneous precipitation and 

growth of hydrates (SCRIVENER et al., 2015)..

system at a water to cement ratio of 0.4 (left) and for the same system but with 40% of the 

clinker particles replaced by a mineral addition (right).  

 

Source: (SCRIVENER et al., 2015). 

 

Limestone is normally used in the industry as a mineral addition in cementitious matrices in 

order to reduce costs concerning the production of fiber-cement (BENTUR AND MINDESS, 

2007). Also, the calcium carbonate mineral addition (limestone) is usually used in research of 

cement based specimens reinforced with eucalyptus cellulosic pulp subjected to accelerated 

carbonation curing, in order to apply this technology for the production of fiber-cement at 

industry (ALMEIDA et al., 2013; SANTOS et al., 2015; PIZZOL et al., 2014). But the mineral 

addition, even if it consists of inert materials blended with cement, may have a significant effect 

on the hydration of the clinker phases (GUTTERIDGE et al., 1990).  

Various studies showed that the presence of limestone leads to the formation of monocarbonate 

due to the reaction between the limestone carbonates and existing aluminates (FELDMAN et 

al., 1965; BENSTED, 1980). The presence of calcite is a few mmol/l and lower compared to 

http://www.linguee.com.br/ingles-portugues/traducao/source.html


 

 

 

40 

 

the other main hydration products like portlandite, ettringite and ill crystallized C–S–H 

(LOTHENBACH et al., 2008). In uncarbonated fiber-cement specimens, the thermogravimetry 

analysis (TGA) showed decomposition ranged between 650 and 850 °C that is related to the 

carbon content in as-received cement and calcium carbonate mineral addition (limestone) 

(ALMEIDA et al., 2013; SANTOS et al., 2015; PIZZOL et al., 2014). Four phases of crystal 

forms calcium carbonate occur with increasing stability, amorphous calcium carbonate, 

vaterite, aragonite, and calcite (HOUST et al., 1996).   

The extra addition of calcium carbonate at the equilibrium reaction of CaCO3 could impede the 

formation of calcium carbonate by the chemical equilibrium established in the system, 

according to the equation:   

 

??(??)2(?) + ??2(?) ? ????3(?) + H2O        (Eq. 3) 

This study examined the implications of calcium carbonate formed during the hydration process 

in cementitious composites subjected to accelerated carbonation curing process. In this context 

the use of limestone as mineral addition could make that measurement challenging. In literature, 

it has been found that inert mineral additions could populate the cementitious matrices without 

interfering with the calcium carbonate formation, such as ground crystalline silica.  

As a strategy to mitigate long term degradation issues, part of the fibre–cement industry 

worldwide produces fibre–cement composed of Portland cement, finely ground crystalline 

silica, and cellulose fibre which are autoclaved to confirm appropriate strength, durability and 

dimensional stability of the composites (COUTTS et al., 1995; COOKE et al., 2000). 

Crystalline silica is soluble in water at high temperatures and pressures (NEWTON et al., 2009). 

Quartz has been the most significant crystalline form of SiO2. The quartz used as mineral 

addition does not react significantly and is nominally an inert material, offering more space for 

hydration products of the PC so as to prolong the acceleration period (LOPEZ, 2009; THOMAS 

et al., 2011).

3. MATERIALS AND METHODS 

3.1.   Stage 2: Definition of optional parameters for supercritical carbonation process of 

vegetable Fiber-cement composites at a very early age 

The aim of the stage 2 is to study the influence of the bleaching of eucalyptus cellulose pulp, 

the initial curing duration, the CO2 exposure time and accelerated aging cycles, on vegetal fiber-

cement composites subjected to supercritical carbonation at early age.  For this study, samples 

were made by the slurry-dewatering and pressing technique, the bulk matrix was reinforced 

with two kinds of pulp: unbleached and bleached. The unbleached eucalyptus pulp reinforced 

composites were submitted to three different sets of curing conditions, which allowed for a 

comparison between composite samples with no carbonation and samples carbonated with 

varying thermal curing durations (24 h v. 48 h). Similarly, the bleached eucalyptus pulp samples 

were submitted to five different sets of curing conditions, thus allowing a comparison between 

samples with no carbonation and samples carbonated with varying supercritical carbonation 

curing durations (1 h v. 2 h) and accelerated ageing cycles (200 soak and dry cycles). A variety 

of analytical test methods were used to assess the hydration kinetics, the mechanical and the 

physical properties, and chemical implications in the composites; between them: X-ray 

diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TG and DTG) and scanning electron 

microscopy (SEM). The initial period of thermal curing (varying from 24 h to 48 h) and 

exposure time to carbonation (from 1 h to 2 h) did not affect with statistical significance the 

mechanical performance of the composites.  

3.1.1. Materials and mix design of stage 2 

3.1.1.1. Vegetable fiber 

For the reinforcement, two kinds of eucalyptus pulp were used: unbleached hardwood kraft 

pulp of eucalyptus (UB) and commercial bleached hardwood kraft pulp of eucalyptus 

(Eucalyptus grandis and Eucalyptus urophylla) (B). The unbleached and bleached eucalyptus 

cellulosic pulp were provided by Suzano Pulp and Paper company and was taken at the 

beginning of the bleaching process and disintegrated, the moisture content was 65 and 45%, 

respectively (MEJIA et al., 2015).  

3.1.1.2. Chemical analyse of Portland cement  

The cement used in this study was the Brazilian brand ordinary Portland cement type CP V-

ARI (high initial strength), corresponding ASTM-C150, Type I. This type of cement according 



 

 

 

42 

 

to Santos et al. 2015 is selected for the fibre-cement industry, due to the finer particle size and 

higher reactivity in comparison to other blended cements available on the Brazilian market. The 

PC was analyzed through LA-950 Laser Diffraction Particle Size Distribution Analyzer and the 

result showed that 50% of the particles are finer than 11.88 µm. The use of this cement in this 

experiment favored the control of the mineral addition to the cement. 

3.1.1.3. Chemical analyse of limestone  

The mineral addition used in this study was the Brazilian Itaú brand ground limestone. This 

mineral addition was chosen because it is commonly used in the industry for partial substitution 

of Portland cement in order to reduce OPC consumption and increase stability (reducing 

shrinkage) (BENTUR AND MINDESS, 2007). The ground limestone was analyzed through 

LA-950 Laser Diffraction Particle Size Distribution Analyzer, the result show that 50% of the 

particles are finer than 12.38 µm. 

3.1.1.4. Fibre cement composite mix design  

The dry mixture (by mass percent) is composed of 77.2% ordinary Portland cement type OCP 

V-ARI, 12.8 % calcium carbonate filler (limestone), and 10.0% eucalyptus pulp; is the same 

formulation as that used by (ALMEIDA et al., 2013), allowing for a comparison between results 

using a climatic or supercritical chamber for carbonation. Also, this range of fiber contents is 

compatible to the production method used (a crude reproduction of the Hatschek industrial 

method), which allows the inclusion of a significant amount of fiber in the inorganic matrix 

(CORREIA et al., 2014). 

The fibre reinforced cement specimens were cast with the dimensions of 200 mm x 200 mm x 

5 mm and mean water/binder ratio of 0.40. The specimens were made using a slurry-dewatering 

process followed by a pressing technique, as simplified reproduction of the Hatschek process 

used in the industrial production of fiber cement (SAVASTANO et al., 2000).  For supercritical 

carbonation, the samples were cut using a diamond bladed water cooled saw into samples with 

dimensions (160 mm x 25 mm x 5 mm). These dimensions were necessary for the samples to 

fit into the carbonation crucible available in the experimental study in laboratory scale.

3.1.1.5. Supercritical CO2 extraction apparatus 

The samples were subjected to supercritical carbonation (SC) in a SULAB brand supercritical 

fluid extractor machine (Figure 9). The machine utilizes a series of pressure valves and a pump 

to inject CO2 into a steel crucible. Approximate 99.5% concentration pure carbon dioxide is 

injected into a crucible capable of holding six samples at once (Figure 10 a-c). The CO2 

employed in the experiments was supplied by the White Martins Gas Industrials Company 

(Brazil). For the entirety of the carbonation, the steel crucible was immersed in a thermal bath 

at 45°C (Figure 10 d). The pressure within the crucible can be regulated using the system of 

seals and gaskets. For this study, a pressure of 20 MPa within the chamber was used, tried to 

ensuring a nearly complete carbonation of samples (for a duration of 2 h within the chamber) 

(Figure 10 e). Of course, the change in pressure is not instantaneous, therefore the first hour of 

carbonation corresponds to a “build-up” period for the pressure to reach 20 MPa, at which point 

samples remain in the chamber for a second hour in order to complete the carbonation cycle. 

(SANTOS et al., 2015).

3.1.2. Curing and conditioning regimes stage 2 

The different sets of curing conditions use the following nomenclature: the first one or two 

letters indicate what type of pulp was used for that batch of samples (B for bleached, UB for 

unbleached) which are summarized in Table 4.  Close examination of the processes described 



 

 

 

45 

 

in Table 4, reveals that it is possible to isolate the effect of the initial thermal hydration duration 

(24 h and 48 h); carbonation exposure (0 h, 1 h or 2 h of curing in an environment with close 

100% CO2 concentration); and, accelerated ageing cycles (0 cycles or 200 cycles). The eight 

conditions shown in Table 4 were cast with the same w/c ratio but with two kinds of eucalyptus 

pulp as reinforcement and treated with different curing regimes.  

 

3.1.2.1. Uncarbonated curing (UC) regime 

After the samples were cast, they underwent 48 hours of thermal curing in a chamber at a RH 

of 90% at 45°C, some of them correspond to unbleached pulp samples (UB) and the other ones 

bleached pulp samples (B). The specimens were then removed from the chamber, sealed, stored 

in air curing at temperature of 25°C, RH of 90%, and atmospheric CO2 concentration (0.035 

vol%). Upon completing the curing process of eleven days, characterization tests were 

performed. These samples belong to the uncarbonated curing (UC) regime. 

3.1.2.2. Supercritical carbonation (SC) curing regime 

After the samples were cast, the unbleached pulp samples UB-SC-48-2 underwent 48 hours of 

thermal curing in an environmental chamber at a RH of 90% at 45°C, while the samples UB-

SC-24-2 underwent 24 hours with the same environmental chamber conditions. Following 

thermal curing, both curing regimes were carbonated for 2 h in a Supercritical CO2 extraction 

apparatus. The bleached pulp samples were also subjected to 48 hours of thermal curing. After 

the thermal curing, the sample B-SC-48-2 was carbonated for 2 h while sample B-SC-48-1 was 

carbonated for 1 h in a Supercritical CO2 extraction apparatus (SANTOS et al., 2015). The 

specimens were then removed from the apparatus, sealed, stored in air curing at temperature of 

25 °C, RH of 90%, and atmospheric CO2 concentration (0.035 vol%)
 (SANTOS et al., 2015). 

Upon completing the curing process of eleven days, characterization tests were performed. 

These samples bellows to the supercritical curing (SC) regime. 

3.1.2.3. Accelerated ageing: soak-dry cycles 

The accelerated ageing test was conducted on two sets of samples, one set of specimens that 

had not undergone the carbonation curing regime, namely, B-AAC, and one set of specimens 

that had been exposed to the 2 h carbonation curing in a SC, namely, B-SC-48-2-AAC.  The 

specimens were then removed from the apparatus, sealed and stored in air curing at temperature 

of 25 °C and atmospheric CO2 concentration (0.035 vol%). Upon completing the curing process 



 

 

 

46 

 

of eleven days, samples were subjected to accelerated ageing cycles. Then, characterization 

tests were performed on both sets. 

The accelerated ageing cycles (AAC) aims to simulate the natural ageing with exposure to 

soaking and drying cycles as tested in previous works (ALMEIDA et al., 2013; TONOLI et al., 

2009). The bleached cellulosic pulp samples were successively immersed into water at 20° ± 

5°C for 170 min and, after an interval of 10 min, they were heated to the temperature of 60° ± 

5°C for 170 min in a ventilated oven. Another interval of 10 min at room temperature elapses 

before the subsequent cycle, as recommended by the EN 494 Standard (1994). Each soak and 

dry set represents one cycle, which was repeated 200 times, i.e., 200 ageing cycles.

Apparent Void Volume (AVV), bulk density (BD), and water absorption (WA) of the 

composites were obtained from the average of eight test specimens (160 mm x 25 mm x 5 mm) 

for each condition, following the procedures specified by ASTM C 948-81 (2009). Physical 

properties were obtained using Eqs.4–6:

3.1.3.2. Mechanical characterization of the fiber-cement composites 

Mechanical properties were obtained for uncarbonated curing (UC), Supercritical carbonation 

curing (SC) and composites upon completing the curing process of fourteen days. Each fiber 

cement specimen was wet cut into four samples measuring 160 mm by 25 mm for the 

mechanical test, using a water cooled diamond saw.  

Eight specimens were evaluated for each condition; mechanical four-point bending flexural 

tests were performed in an EMIC DL-30000 testing machine equipped with a 1 kN load cell, a 

four-point bending configuration, a lower span of 135 mm, an upper span of 45 mm and a 

deflection rate of 1.5 mm/min. The mechanical properties evaluated were: Modulus of rupture 

(MOR), Limit of proportionality (LOP), Modulus of elasticity (MOE) and Specific Energy 

(SE). Mechanical properties were obtained using Eqs. 7 – 10 as described in detail by 

(ALMEIDA et al., 2013; TONOLI et al., 2009).

3.1.3.3. Thermal analysis TG/DTG 

Chemical changes such degradation of cellulose, as well as transition temperatures in fiber 

based composites, are studied through derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) 

(SATYANARAYANA et al., 2009); the samples were ground using a pestle and mortar, sieved 

until particles smaller than 75 ?m, then analyzed in a Thermogravimetric Analyzer NETZSCH 

STA 449 F3. The experimental conditions were: rates of 10°C/min for heating and 40 mL/min 

for nitrogen injection. The sample with range (20 – 900°C) at a constant rate (ROSTAMI et al., 

2012; PIZZOL et al., 2014), yielding TGA and DTG curves of the extruded cellulosic fiber–

cement submitted to supercritical CO2 curing (SC) and uncarbonated (UC) treatments.  The 

amount of calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2, and calcium carbonate, CaCO3, was estimated from 

the weight loss measured in the TGA curve between the initial and final temperature of the 

corresponding DTG peak. 

Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) and derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) were used to 

inspect the nature of hydration products formed in the cement-based systems. The different 

DTG peaks measured when hydrated cement is heated in a thermobalance correspond to: at 100 

°C - weight loss due to the dehydration of water pores, between 100 °C to 300 °C - different 

stages of dehydration of C–S–H, at 500 °C - dehydroxylation of Ca(OH)2, and at 700 °C - 

decarbonation of CaCO3 (ROSTAMI et al., 2012). 

3.1.3.4. Phases analysis X-Ray diffraction (XRD) 

This x-Ray diffraction technique consists in identify crystalline phases presents in samples, 

characterize for be a qualitative analyze. The diffractometer produces waves at a known 

frequency, which is determined by their source. This technique was applied in order to identify 

the main crystalline phases and compere between the specimens for the principal found 

components in Portland cement hydrated. The single crystal diffraction and the angle between 

the beam axis and the ring is called the scattering angle and in X-ray crystallography always 

denoted as 2? (in scattering of visible light the convention is usually to call it ?). The 

identification of the phases were made throught the data base “International Centre for 

Diffraction Data” (ICDD). 

The X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) technique, allows the identification of crystalline phases in 

materials, (CHANG et al., 2006). The analyses were performed using a Rigaku MiniFlex 600, 

with range 10-60° (2?) and rate of 15°/min.

3.1.3.5. Microstructural analysis by Scanning Electron Microscopy - (SEM) 

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used with a back-scatter electron (BSE) image 

detector, operated at 15 kV accelerating voltage, for visualization of the microstructure on the 

surface of the composites. The images were captured by a Hitachi Tabletop Microscope 

TM3000. 

The preparation of specimens for BSE was accomplished with impregnation using epoxy resin. 

BSE samples were manually polished in a Struers TegraPol-11 machine using silicon carbide 

abrasive paper with sequential grit sizes 320, 600, 1000 for 6 min, using isopropyl alcohol as 

lubricant. A final polishing was carried out using in turn 6, 3, l µm diamond polishing 

compound for 6 min with each size.  

Approximately six SEM micrographs were obtained for each composite treatment, with typical 

images of the observed microstructure being used in this manuscript. 

3.2. Stage 3: Comparative study between two kinds of mineral addition in cellulose pulp 

fiber-cement composites subjected to accelerated carbonation at very early age. 

The aim of this stage 3 is to compare two kinds of mineral addition on vegetal fiber-cement 

composites subjected to accelerated carbonation at a very early age.  For this study, samples 

were produced by the slurry-dewatering and pressing technique. The samples were submitted 

to carbonation process, with varying the mineral addition (limestone v. ground silica) and the 

initial curing durations (10 h v. 24 h). A variety of analytical test methods were used to assess 

the hydration kinetics, the mechanical and the physical properties, and chemical implications 

in the composites; between them: X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy 

(SEM).  

3.2.1. Materials and mix design stage 3 

3.2.1.1.Vegetable fibre 

Unrefined pine unbleached cellulosic pulp (P) was used in this study.  The fiber is produced by 

the OJSC Solombala Pulp and Paper Mill - brand located in the industrial zone of the city 

of Arkhangelsk, in North-West Russia. This is a type of fibre Pine Spruce, processed as 

unbleached northern softwood kraft.  Morton et al. (2010) physically describe the Solombala 

pinus fibre with an average length of 2.7 mm, coarseness of 15.55 mg/100 m, wall thickness of 

7.9 µm, and a fibre width of 30.7 µm.

3.2.1.2.Chemical analyse of Portland cement 

The cement used in this study was the Brazilian Cauê brand ordinary Portland cement type PC 

V-ARI (high initial strength), corresponding ASTM-C150, Type I, this type of cement 

according to Santos et al. 2015 is selected for fibre reinforced cementitious composites, due the 

finer particle size and higher reactivity in comparison to other blended cements available in the 

Brazilian market. The PC V-ARI was analyzed through LA-950 Laser Diffraction Particle Size 

Distribution Analyzer, the result show that 50% of the particles are finer than 8.67 µm.  

3.2.1.3. Chemical analyse of Limestone   

The mineral addition used in this study was the Brazilian Itaú brand ground limestone (L). This 

mineral addition was chosen because it is commonly used in the industry for partial substitution 

of Portland cement in order to reduce OPC consumption and increase stability (reducing 

shrinkage) (BENTUR AND MINDESS, 2007). The ground limestone was analyzed through 

LA-950 Laser Diffraction Particle Size Distribution Analyzer, the result show that 50% of the 

particles are finer than 12.38 µm. Figure 11 shows the XRD, the analysis was made by a Rigaku 

MiniFlex 600 with range 10-60° (2?) and rate of 15°/min.  

Figure 12 shows the XRD patterns of quantification of the phases for limestone. The chemical 

compositions of the limestone are calcite with 68.4%, dolomite 29% and quartz 2.6%, 

determined through the software PANalytical HighScore Plus, using Rietveld method.  Various 

research shows that the reaction occurs on a definite boundary between the lime and carbonate 

phases (HILLS, 1968). 

The presence of dolomite [CaMg(CO3)2] in this cementitious composite can be explained as it 

is one of the forms limestone and has a similar crystal structure to that of calcite, having a face-

centred rhombohedral cell (MCINTOSH et al., 1990).  

Dolomite reaction involves the direct formation of calcium carbonate via Magnesian calcite 

with a gradual release of Mg2+ ions to form calcite. It is proposed that the progression of carbon 

dioxide from surface defects initiates decomposition, dissociation into the two carbonates as 

described in eq. (11) (HASHIMOTO et al., 1976; MCINTOSH et al., 1990).

3.2.1.4. Chemical analyse of Ground Silica 

The silicate used in this work was the Brazilian Mineração Jundu brand crystalline grounded 

silicate with a real bulk density of 2.65 (g/cm3). The ground silica was analyzed through LA-

950 Laser Diffraction Particle Size Distribution Analyzer, the result shows that 50% of the 

particles are finer than 17.6 µm. The Figure 13 shows the XRD test results, the analysis was 

made by a Rigaku MiniFlex 600 with range 10-60° (2?) and rate of 15°/min.

Crystalline Silica it is chemically and thermodynamically stable at low temperatures and 

atmospheric pressure (SINGH et al., 2013). Figure 14 shows that the silica used have a crystal 

estructure of quartz, determined through the software PANalytical HighScore Plus and Rietveld 

method. The use of silica as mineral addition with this level of crystallinity in cementitious 

matrices does not interfere with the formation of cement hydration phases but gives relatively 

more space for the hydrates of the clinker phases (SINGH et al., 2013; SCRIVENER et al., 

2015).

3.2.1.5. Analyses of particle size distribution between limestone and silica 

The OPC V-ARI, the limestone and the silica was analyzed by the means LA-950 Laser 

Diffraction Particle Size Distribution Analyzer. The Figure 15 shows the particle size 

distribution using the ordinary Portland cement type OCP V-ARI (high initial strength) and 

considering the mix design of dry mass 70% of cement and 30% of mineral addition (ground 

silica or limestone), the model used was Fuller and Thomson proposed the gradation curves for 

maximum density, which is well known as Fuller’s “ideal” curve. Both formulations had a 

bimodal profile, almost the same points, there are few differences between the formulations 

until 10 µm. Comparing the two formulations, this analyses indicates that the ground silica 

could be used as mineral addition instead the limestone as it was used on the stage two of this 

thesis.

mixture (by mass percent) is composed of 64% Brazilian Cauê brand ordinary Portland cement 

type OPC V-ARI (high initial strength), corresponding to ASTM-C150, Type I, 28% Brazilian 

brand limestone mineral addition, and 8.0% unrefined pine unbleached cellulosic pulp.

unrefined pine unbleached cellulosic pulp. 

The fibre reinforced cement specimens were cast with the dimensions of 200 mm x 200 mm x 

5 mm and average water/binder ratio of 0.40.  The specimens were made using a slurry-

dewatering process followed by a pressing technique, as an approximate reproduction of the 

Hatschek process used in the industrial production of fibre cement (SAVASTANO et al., 2000).

3.2.3.3. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis 

This XRD technique consists in identifying crystalline phases present in samples, as a 

qualitative analysis. The diffractometer produces waves at a known frequency, which is 

determined by their source. This technique was applied in order to identify the main crystalline 

phases and compare between the specimens for the main components in Portland cement 

hydrated. The single crystal diffraction and the angle between the beam axis and the ring is 

called the scattering angle and in X-ray crystallography always denoted as 2? (in scattering 

of the convention is usually to call it ?). The identification of the phases was made throughout 

the data base “International Centre for Diffraction Data” (ICDD). 

The X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) technique, allows the identification of crystalline phases in 

materials, (CHANG et al., 2006). The analyses were performed using a Rigaku MiniFlex 600, 

with range 10-60° (2?) and rate of 15°/min. 

International Centre Diffraction Data (2003) and PANalytical HighScore Plus Inorganic Crystal 

Structure Database (2007) were applied to identify crystalline phases. The PANalytical 

HighScore Plus was used too for made a quantification estimative of the clinker phases, 

considering only the crystalline part of the material and excluding the amorphous part.

composites using silica as a mineral addition. 

The aim of this stage 4 is to study the durability and hydration kinetics in carbonated composites 

reinforced with unbleached pines cellulose pulp fiber and used silica as a mineral addition. 

Samples were prepared by the slurry-dewatering and pressing technique. The samples were 

submitted to two different sets of curing conditions, which allowed for a comparison between 

uncarbonated samples and samples carbonated with varying initial curing durations (10 h v. 24 

h) and then subjected to 200 accelerated ageing cycles. A variety of analytical test methods 

were used to assess the hydration kinetics, the mechanical and the physical properties, and 

chemical implications in the composites: X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis 

(TG), Infrared spectrometer (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and B.E.T. surface

3.3.2. Curing and conditioning regimes of stage 4 

This experiment exposes the composite specimens to eight different curing and ageing 

conditions, which are summarized in Table 10.  Close examination of the processes described 

in Table 10, reveals that it is possible to isolate the effect of hydration duration (10 h and 24 h); 

carbonation exposure (0 h or 10 h of curing in an environment with 20% CO2 concentration); 

and, accelerated ageing cycles (0 cycles or 200 cycles). 

3.3.2.1. Uncarbonated curing (UC) regime  

After the samples were casted, some of them were stored in favorable conditions for hydration 

during 10 h (P-UC-10), and the others were stored in the favorable hydration conditions for 24 

h (P-UC-24) in the Thermotron climate chamber, at temperature of 25°C and relative humidity 

(RH) of 90%. After that initial curing conditions, for both hydration durations, the settings of 

the Thermotron ESPEC environmental test chamber were 45°C temperature, 90% relative 

humidity (RH) and atmospheric CO2 concentration (0.035 vol%) for 10 h. The specimens were 

then removed from the chamber and stored in thermal curing at temperature of 60°C and 90% 

relative humidity (RH), composites upon completing the thermal curing process of six days 

were subjected to the characterization tests (ROJAS et al., 2002). 

 

3.3.2.2. Accelerated carbonation (AC) curing regime 

After the samples were casted, some specimens were stored in the favorable hydration 

conditions for 10 h (P-AC-10) and the other group was stored in the hydration condition for 24 

h (P-AC-24) in the Thermotron environmental test chamber, at temperature of 25°C relative 

humidity (RH) of 90%. Both sets of samples were then subjected to 10 h of accelerated 

carbonation in the ESPEC brand environmental test chamber at temperature of 45°C and 

relative humidity (RH) of 90%. The CO2 content in the climate chamber was monitored to 20 

vol%. The specimens were then removed from the chamber and stored in thermal curing at 



 

 

 

61 

 

temperature of 60°C and 90% relative humidity (RH), composites upon completing the thermal 

curing process of six days were subjected to the characterization tests (ROJAS et al., 2002).  

3.3.2.3. Accelerated ageing: soak-dry cycles 

The accelerated ageing test was conducted on four sets of samples which are two sets of 

specimens that had not undergone the carbonation curing regime, namely, P-UC-10-ACC and 

P-UC-24-AAC, and two sets of specimens that had been exposed to the 10 h carbonation curing, 

namely, P-AC-10-ACC and P-AC-24-AAC. The specimens were successively immersed into 

water at 20 ± 5°C for 170 min and, after 10 min, they were heated to the temperature of 60 ± 

5°C for 170 min in a ventilated oven. Another interval of 10 min at room temperature elapses 

before the subsequent cycle, as recommended by the EN 494 Standards 1994. Each soak-dry 

set represents one cycle, which was repeated 200 times, or in other words, 200 ageing cycles 

(TONOLI et al., 2009; ALMEIDA et al., 2013).

3.3.3. Test methods stage 4 

3.3.3.1. Physical characterization of the fiber-cement composites 

Apparent Void Volume (AVV), Bulk Density (BD), and Water Absorption (WA) of the 

composites were obtained from the average of eight test specimens (160 mm x 25 mm x 5 mm) 

for each condition, following the procedures specified by ASTM C 948-81 (2009). Physical 

properties were calculated by Eqs.4 to 6: 

??? (%) = (

where Msat is the saturated with dry surface specimen’s mass, Mdry is the dry specimen’s mass 

after 24 h at 105ºC, Mi is the immersed in water specimen’s mass and ? is the water bulk density 

(g/cm3)  

3.3.3.2. Mechanical characterization of the fiber-cement composites  

Mechanical properties were obtained for uncarbonated curing (UC), accelerated carbonated 

curing (AC) and composites upon completing the curing process of seven days. Each fiber 

cement specimen was wet cut into four samples measuring 160 mm x 25 mm for the mechanical 

test, using a water cooled diamond saw.

Eight specimens were evaluated for each condition; mechanical flexural tests were performed 

in an EMIC DL-30000 universal testing machine equipped with a 1 kN load cell, a four-point 

bending configuration, a lower span of 135 mm, an upper span of 45 mm and a deflection rate 

of 1.5 mm/min. The mechanical properties evaluated were: modulus of rupture (MOR), limit 

of proportionality (LOP), modulus of elasticity (MOE) and specific energy (SE). Mechanical 

properties were determined by Eqs. 7 to 10 as described in detail by (ALMEIDA et al., 2013; 

TONOLI et al., 2009).

where Pmax is the maximum load rate, Plop is the load at the upper point of the linear portion of 

the load–deflection curve, Lv is the major span, width (b) and depth (h) and m is the tangent of 

the slope angle of the load vs. deflection plotting in the elastic behavior. SE was defined as the 

energy absorbed during the flexural test and divided by the specimen cross-sectional area 

(ALMEIDA et al., 2013; TONOLI et al., 2009).   

3.3.3.3. Thermal analysis TG/DTG 

The efficiency of the carbonation process for the eight sets of curing regimes, was studied 

through thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) and differential thermogravimetry analysis (DTG) 

(SATYANARAYANA, et al., 2009). The samples were ground using a pestle and mortar, 

sieved until particles smaller than 75 ?m, then analyzed in a Thermogravimetric Analyzer with 

NETZSCH TASC 414/3 T6. Experimental test was performed in the temperature range of 20 

to 900°C and rates of 10°C/min for heating and 40 mL/min of nitrogen injection (PIZZOL et 

al., 2014; ROSTAMI et al., 2012). Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) and differential 

thermogravimetry (DTG) were used to inspect the nature of hydration and carbonate products 

formed in the cement-based systems. The different DTG peaks measured when hydrated cement 

was heated in the thermobalance correspond to:  

• 100°C - weight loss due to the dehydration of water pores; 

• 100 to 300°C - different stages of dehydration of C–S–H; 



 

 

 

64 

 

• 500°C - dehydroxylation of Ca(OH)2; 

• 700°C - decarbonation of CaCO3. 

The accelerated carbonation increased the mass loss at the range between 650 and 750°C related 

to decomposition of the poorly crystallized CaCO3 and at the range between 750 and 850°C 

related to decomposition of the well-crystallized CaCO3, as also reported elsewhere 

(ROSTAMI et al., 2012; PIZZOL et al., 2014). 

3.3.3.4. FTIR Spectrometer analysis 

The molecular identification of the composite of the eight sets of curing regimes, were studied 

through the diffuse reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.  The vibrations of 

molecules were measured with a TENSOR 27 FTIR with an insert cell for diffuse reflection 

spectroscopy.  The measurement range lies between 400 and 4,000 cm-1 with a nominal 

resolution of 2 cm-1. 

The DR-FTIR spectroscopy technique relies on the vibration modes of characteristic groups in 

a compound, i.e. not on the crystallinity of the sample. FTIR spectra of the uncarbonated and 

carbonated samples also confirm ??3
2 from calcium carbonate polymorphs (between 850–890 

cm-1 and 1400–1500 cm-1), ??4
2(between 900–1000 cm-1) and OH- (between 3200–3500 cm-1) 

groups from ettringite and S-rich phases. Thus DR-FTIR spectroscopy is a very suitable method 

for monitoring the formation of compounds such as carbonates in cement (YLMÉN et al., 

2013). 

3.3.3.5. Phases analysis X-Ray diffraction (XRD) 

The crystalline phases identification of the composite of the eight sets of curing regimes, were 

studied through the X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). The phase identification and structural changes 

of the products was investigated by a Philips PW-1730 X-ray diffractometer (XRD) equipment. 

Peak position (2?) with range 10-60°, the full-width at half maximum (FWHM), and area under 

peak (A) were obtained from the XRD spectra. 

International Centre Diffraction Data (2003) and PANalytical HighScore Plus Inorganic Crystal 

Structure Database (2007) were applied to identify crystalline phases. The PANalytical 

HighScore Plus was also applied for a quantitative estimative of the clinker phases, considering 

only the crystalline part of the material and excluding the amorphous part.

3.3.3.6. Microstructural analysis by Scanning Electron Microscopy - (SEM) 

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was applied with a back-scattered electron (BSE) image 

detector, operated at 15 kV accelerating voltage, for visualization of the microstructure on the 

surface of the composites. The images were captured by a JEOL machine, model 6610 

LV. Magnification ranged from 300 up to 750x.  

The preparation of specimens for BSE was accomplished with impregnation using epoxy resin. 

BSE samples were manually polished in a Struers TegraPol-11 machine using silicon carbide 

abrasive paper with sequential grit sizes 320, 600, 1000 for 6 min, using alcohol as lubricant. 

A final polishing was carried out using in turn 6, 3 and l µm diamond polishing compound 

during 6 min each size.  

Around six SEM micrographs were obtained for each composite treatment and just the most 

relevant images of the microstructure observed were displayed in this manuscript. The energy-

dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was carried out through Inca software.  

 

3.3.3.7. Dynamic water vapor sorption- BET method 

Dynamic vapor sorption (DVS) was also used to investigate the mesopore structure of the eight 

curing regimes composites. The dynamic vapor adsorption method is performed using a facility 

provided by Surface Measurement System Ltd. London, UK. Approximately 0.1 g of dry 

sample in small pieces was placed on a dish in the chamber in which the RH could be precisely 

and automatically controlled by mixing a proportional amount of nitrogen gas and moisture. 

The RH was then changed by step each time until the mass change was lower than 0.002% (by 

mass fraction, the same below) per minute until the target RH of 30% (LIWU AND PANESAR, 

2014). 

The Brunauer Emmett Teller BET method deduces the adsorption branch of an isotherm to 

provide an amount of the specific surface area of the inner pore area, an indication of overall 

porosity (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, 1985). This measure, referred to 

as the BET specific surface area, is derived from the humidity content of the sample when a 

complete sorptive monolayer has formed. It is assumed that a complete monolayer is formed 

on all available inner surfaces prior to any multilayer condensation due to the difference 

between heats of adsorption and liquefaction of the adsorbent (BRUNAUER et al., 1938). The 



 

 

 

66 

 

BET specific surface area, ABET, is calculated as (COLLETT et al., 2008; PANESAR et al., 

2014): 

???? = ???
??

??
     (Eq. 13) 

where ?m is the surface area of an adsorbed molecule of water (10 Å2), N is Avogadro’s number 

(6.023 x1023), wm is the moisture content at monolayer saturation (kg/kg), and Mm is the molar 

mass of water (18.07 g/mol) (BRUNAUER et al., 1938). 

3.4. Stage 5: Evolution of the hydration kinetics on unbleached cellulose pulp fiber-

cement composites subjected to accelerated carbonation at very early age 

The aim of stage 5 is to study the carbonation kinetic hydration at very early age on unbleached 

pines cellulose pulp fiber-cement composites using silica as a mineral addition. For this study, 

samples were prepared by the slurry-dewatering and pressing technique. The carbonation 

process was monitored along 10 h, each hour corresponds to a condition. A variety of analytical 

test methods was used to assess the hydration kinetics, the chemical implications in the 

composites; between them: X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TG and 

DTG), Infrared spectrometer (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  

3.4.1. Materials and mix design stage 5 

3.4.1.1. Vegetable fibre   

Unrefined pine unbleached cellulosic pulp was used in this study.  The fiber is produced by the 

OJSC Solombala Pulp and Paper Mill - brand located in the industrial zone of the city 

of Arkhangelsk, in North-West Russia. This is a type of fibre Pine Spruce, processed as 

unbleached northern softwood kraft.  Morton et al. (2010) physically describe the Solombala 

pinus fibre with an average length of 2.7 mm, coarseness of 15.55 mg/100 m, wall thickness of 

7.9 ?m, and a fibre width of 30.7 ?m???  

3.4.1.2. Chemical analyse of Portland Cement  

The cement used in this study was the Brazilian Cauê brand ordinary Portland cement type OCP 

V-ARI (high initial strength), corresponding to the ASTM-C150, Type I. According to Santos 

et al. (2015), this type of cement is selected for fibre reinforced cementitious composites, due 

to the finer particle size and higher reactivity in comparison to other blended cements available 

in the Brazilian market. The OPC type V-ARI is well known to be high sulfate resistant, as the 

chemical reaction between cement compounds and sulfates causes undesirable expansion of the 



 

 

 

67 

 

mixture. The OPC was characterized through LA-950 Laser Diffraction Particle Size 

Distribution Analyzer, and the results show that 50% of the particles are finer than 8.67 µm.  

 

3.4.1.3. Chemical analyse of Ground silica 

Silica quartz type is a neutral material, chemically and thermodynamically very stable at low 

temperatures (e.g. 45°C) and atmospheric pressure. This material could be used as mineral 

addition in carbonated cementitious composites for avoiding interference with the main 

crystalline phases formed along the accelerated carbonation process (FOURNIER AND 

ROWE, 1977; SINGH et al. 2013).  

The crystalline silica used in this work was supported by Brazilian Mineração Jundu with a real 

density of 2.65 (g/cm3). The particle size distribution of the silica mineral addition shows that 

50% of the particles are finer than 17.6 ?m.  

3.4.1.4. Fibre cement composite mix design 

The raw materials with their respective amount, used on the fiber-cement composites are shown 

in Table 11. The formulation is based on previous work carried out by Almeida et al. (2010). 

The dry mixture (by mass percent) is composed of 64% Brazilian Cauê brand ordinary Portland 

cement type OPC V-ARI (high initial strength), corresponding to ASTM-C150, Type I 

(PICANÇO et al., 2008), 28% Brazilian Mineração Jundu brand silica quartz type mineral 

addition, and 8% unrefined pine unbleached cellulosic pulp. 

The fibre reinforced cement specimens were cast with the dimensions of 200 mm x 200 mm x 

5 mm and mean water/binder factor of 0.40.  The specimens were elaborated using a slurry-

dewatering process followed by a pressing technique, as a simplified reproduction of the 

Hatschek process used in the industrial production of fibre cement (SAVASTANO et al., 2000).

3.4.2. Curing and conditioning regimes of stage 5 

This experiment exposes the composite specimens to eleven different curing conditions, which 

are summarized in Table 12 and the curing process shows at Figure 15.  Close examination of 

the processes described in Table 12 reveals that it is possible to isolate the effect of hydration 

duration (10 h and 24 h) and carbonation exposure (from 0 h up to 10 h of curing in an 

environment with 20% CO2 concentration). 

3.4.2.1. Accelerated carbonation (AC) curing regime 

After preparation, the samples were stored in the chamber for initial hydration condition for 

24h at climatic test chamber at 25°C and relative humidity (RH) of 90% (Figure 15 - a.).  Then 

they were removed from the chamber and each fibre-cement specimen was cut into four samples 

measuring 100 mm by 50 mm (Figure 15 - c.). All samples were introduced at the same time in 

the climate chamber for the accelerated carbonation at 45°C and relative humidity (RH) of 90%. 

The CO2 content in the climate chamber was monitored to be 20 vol%. One hour after the 

initiation of the carbonation process, two cut samples were removed from the chamber, then 

immersed in acetone, in order to stop the hydration; this process was repeated until the 

completion of the 10 conditions corresponding to each hour of carbonation process along 10 h. 

The samples were monitored during carbonation process using phenolphthalein indicator. For 

each hour of carbonation, small pieces of the specimens were removed for checking the status 

of the internal region of the cross section, according to the intensity of the color displayed by 

the indicator (Figure 15 - d.). Table 12 shows the description of curing regimes applied.

3.4.3. Test methods of stage 5 

3.4.3.1. Thermal analysis DTA/TGA 

 The efficiency of carbonation process for the eleven sets of curing regimes, was studied 

through the differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetry analysis (TG) 

(SATYANARAYANA, et al., 2009). The samples were ground using a pestle and mortar, 

sieved until particles smaller than 75 ?m, then analyzed in a Thermogravimetric Analyzer with 

NETZSCH TASC 414/3 T6. Equipment was used in a temperature range of 20 to 900°C and 

rates of 10°C/min for heating and 40 mL/min for nitrogen injection (PIZZOL et al., 2014; 

ROSTAMI et al., 2012).  

For the uncarbonated samples there is one clear endothermic peak at 460°C which matches with 

Ca(OH)2. For the carbonated samples, there is also a clear endothermic peak at 800°C 

corresponding to CaCO3 (SKOOG et al., 1994; LIWU et al., 2012). Therefore, the accelerated 

carbonation increased the mass loss at the range between 650 and 750°C related to 

decomposition of the poorly crystallized CaCO3 and at the range between 750 and 850°C related 

to decomposition of the well-crystallized CaCO3, as also reported by (ROSTAMI et al., 2012; 

PIZZOL et al., 2014). 

3.4.3.2. Phases analysis X-Ray diffraction (XRD) 

The crystalline phases identification of the composite of the eleven sets of curing regimes, were 

studied through the X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). The phase identification and structural changes 

of the products were investigated by a Philips PW-1730 X-ray diffractometer (XRD). Peak 

position (2?) with range 10-60°, the full-width at half maximum (FWHM), and the area under 

peak (A) were obtained from the XRD spectra. 

International Centre Diffraction Data (2003) and PANalytical HighScore Plus Inorganic Crystal 

Structure Database (2007) were applied to identify crystalline phases. 

3.4.3.3. Chemical analysis FTIR spectrometer 

The molecular identification of the composite of the eleven sets of curing regimes, were studied 

through the diffuse reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DR-FTIR) with a 

TENSOR 27 FTIR with an insert cell for diffuse reflection spectroscopy.  The measurement 

range lies between 400 and 4,000 cm-1 with a nominal resolution of 2 cm-1. 

The DR-FTIR spectroscopy technique relies on the vibration modes of characteristic groups in 

a compound, i.e. not on the crystallinity of the sample. FTIR spectra of the uncarbonated and 



 

 

 

71 

 

carbonated samples also confirm CO3
2  from calcium carbonate polymorphs (between 850–890 

cm-1 and 1400–1500 cm-1),  SO4
2(between 900–1000 cm-1) and OH- (between 3200–3500 cm-1) 

groups from ettringite and S-rich phases. Thus DR-FTIR spectroscopy is a very suitable method 

for monitoring the formation of compounds such as carbonates in cement (YLMÉN et al.,2013). 

3.4.3.4. Microstructural analysis by Scanning Electron Microscopy - (SEM) 

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used with a back-scattered electron image (BSEI) 

detector, operated at 15 kV accelerating voltage, for visualization of the microstructure on the 

polished surface of the composites. The images were captured by a JEOL machine, model 6610 

LV. Magnification ranged 300 times.  

The preparation of specimens for BSEI SEM was accomplished with impregnation using epoxy 

resin. BSEI samples were manually polished in a Struers TegraPol-11 machine using silicon 

carbide abrasive paper with sequential grit sizes 320, 600, 1000 for 6 min, using alcohol as 

lubricant. A final polishing was carried out using in turn 6, 3, l µm diamond polishing 

compound during 6 min each size.  

Around six SEM micrographs were obtained for each composite treatment and just the most 

relevant images of the microstructure observed were used in this manuscript.

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  

4.1.   Stage 2: Definition of optional parameters for supercritical carbonation process of 

vegetable Fiber-cement composites at a very early age 

4.1.1. Mechanical and physical characteristics of stage 2 

Table 13 presents a summary of the average values and corresponding standard deviation of the 

physical properties (AVV, BD and WA) and mechanical properties (MOR, LOP, MOE and 

SE), under flexural loading respectively for all curing scenarios.  

The curing conditions were conducted on eight sets of samples which were three sets reinforced 

with unbleached eucalyptus pulp and five sets reinforced with bleached eucalyptus pulp. For 

both types of reinforcing pulp, the effect of supercritical carbonation exposure was studied (0 

h, 1 h or 2 h of curing in an environment with close 100% CO2 concentration); for the set of 

unbleached pulp the effect of thermal hydration duration was studied (24 h and 48 h); and for 

bleached pulp samples the effect of accelerated ageing cycles was studied (0 and 200 soak and 

dry cycles). A summary of the statistical significance testing is presented in Table 14 for the 

physical and mechanical properties.  A ‘0’ in the table averages that there is no statistically 

significant difference between the averages, ‘+’ indicates that there is a statistically significant 

difference between the means with the first listed condition having higher averages than the 

second, and ‘-’ indicates the first listed condition had a lower mean than the second. E.g. for 

the AVV column of UB vs. UB-SC-48-2, the ‘+’ indicates that the averages AVV of UB was 

greater than that of UB-SC-48-2, whereas the ‘-’ in the BD column indicates the UB samples 

had a lower average BD than the UB-SC-48-2 samples.

The effect of Exposure to Carbonation Curing:  The supercritical carbonation at early stages 

in the curing process resulted in many improvements to the mechanical properties of cement 

composites, reinforced with both bleached and unbleached eucalyptus pulp. Between samples 

UB vs. UB-SC-48-2, UB vs. UB-SC-24-2, B vs. B-SC-48-1, B vs. B-SC-48-2, and B-AAC vs 

B-SC-48-2-AAC, the statistically significant difference shows that carbonation had an effect 

on specimen’s bulk density, water absorption, and modulus of elasticity.  

Almeida et al. (2013) studied cement based specimens reinforced with eucalyptus cellulosic 

pulp subjected to accelerated carbonation curing (AC) with similar mechanical behavior. There 

is also a noticeable improvement to the flexural toughness of sisal and eucalyptus cellulosic 

pulp fiber-reinforced cement composites as a result of the supercritical carbonation curing 

(SANTOS et al., 2015). In these previous studies, the mechanical improvement was attributed 

to the elimination of calcium hydroxide due to the carbonation treatment (PIZZOL et al., 2014).    

The production of calcium carbonate during carbonation results in a better connected cement 

fiber matrix with fewer voids, responsible for the added strength and stiffness of the material. 

Observations showed that the major product formed for supercritically carbonated samples was 

calcium carbonate (Calcite). This product fills the voids in the cement matrix increasing bulk 

density, stiffness and strength, while decreasing the apparent void volume (AVV); these effects 

are a result of calcium carbonate's higher density than calcium hydroxide.  

The effect of Hydration time: Samples UB-SC-48-2 vs. UB-SC-24-2 compared the effect of 

increasing the thermal hydration time from 24 h to 48 h, the statistically significant difference 

shows that the change had no effect on specimen’s bulk density, water adsorption, modulus of 

rupture, modulus of elasticity or specific energy. So, it would seem the initial 24 h of thermal 

curing yields a substantial amount of hydration products, enough so as to not limit the 

carbonation process, because once carbon dioxide dissolves and reacts with hydration products 

(CH and C–S–H) or with anhydrous phases (C3S and C2S), it forms CaCO3 by the combination 

of moist CO2 with Ca
2+ (FERNANADEZ-BERTOS et al., 2004; ROSTAMI et al., 2012; 

ALMEIDA et al., 2013). 

However, the AVV was affected, a short thermal hydration time (24 h) resulted in a higher 

AVV for UB-SC-24-2. The difference of AVV is due to the progression of the hydration process 

(TONOLI et al., 2009). There are many aspects that can influence the reaction kinetics and the 

amounts of the hydrated phases produced (MURAT, 1983; TAHA et al., 1985; SILVA et al., 



 

 

 

76 

 

1990). The most important one is the curing temperature, because it influences the stability and 

the transformation of the hydrates (ROJAS et al., 2002). The AVV values decreased with longer 

durations of thermal curing (between UB-SC-48-2 and UB-SC-24-2).  

The effect of Carbonation time: Samples B-SC-48-1 vs. B-SC-48-2, compared the effect of 

decreasing the carbonation time from 2 h to 1 h, the statistically significant difference shows 

that the variation had no effect on specimen’s bulk density, modulus of rupture, modulus of 

elasticity and specific energy. Santos et al. (2015) proposed 2 h for the whole accelerated 

supercritical carbonation process, the first hour to reach the equilibrium treatment and the 

second hour to extend the treatment after achieving the equilibrium treatment conditions. Due 

to the negligible difference between 1 h and 2 h (Table 14), it would appear that for guaranteed 

improvement to the mechanical properties of the composites, the accelerated supercritical 

carbonation process can be 1 h of treatment, the first hour when equilibrium conditions are 

reached. 

The effect of cellulosic Pulp: Samples created with the unbleached pulp had lower average 

values of mechanical properties than their bleached pulp counterparts having undergone the 

same curing process, as shown in Figure 16 which describes the typical stress x strain curves 

of the two kinds of composites. The comparison between carbonated samples UB-SC-48-2 vs. 

B-SC-48-2 resulted in average values of MOR, LOP, MOE, and SE that were 24%, 24%, 27% 

and 25% higher for the bleached pulp samples. This is due in part to the lignin content difference 

between the types of fibers. The bleached cellulose fiber used in this study was subjected to an 

oxygen delignification process (MANOIR et al., 1993), which is a removal of: 92-95% of lignin 

from wood, the residual lignin (hexenuronic acid groups and extractives), and a destruction of 

chromophores (SJÖSTRÖM, 1993; DENCE AND REEVE, 1996), which are the amorphous 

components of the fiber (DENCE AND REEVE, 1996; CORREIA et al., 2016). The bleached 

fibers with higher crystallinity and lower amounts of phenolic polymer, resulted in an increased 

stiffness and embrittlement of the fiber (WEI AND MEYER, 2015). This argument is reiterated 

by numerous authors with similar results, that the degree of crystallinity influences the physical 

and mechanical properties of the fibers (STURCOVA et al, 2005), particularly the elastic 

modulus (CHEN et al., 2012). Also, inside microfibrils of the pulp the cellulose networks could 

have an organized structure and increased crystallinity (CORREIA et al., 2014). The degree of 

crystallinity and the organized structure could be influence the effect of carbonation process in 

bleached pulp fiber-cement composite with higher tensile strength, void content and interfacial 

adhesion of the composite.  



 

 

 

77 

 

The amorphous regions in cellulose are weaker due to hydrophobic properties, reagent attacks 

and the enzymes, this requires investigations on the use of amorphous samples, understanding 

the thermal, chemical and mechanical behavior in crystal regions (LENGOWSKI et al., 2013). 

When vegetal fibers are exposed to chemical treatments that result in significant hydrolysis, 

oxidation, dehydration reactions, etc. (SAHA et al., 2012; PITARELO, 2013) or mechanical 

treatments, the crystallinity of cellulose could be altered (MEJIA et al., 2015). In alkaline 

cementitious matrices, the amorphous regions protect the fiber from the attack, but when the 

pH of the composite is reduced, the amorphous areas do not work as well as those of a fiber 

that has a higher crystallinity. Which average the degree of crystallinity of the natural fiber 

influences the improvement of the mechanical behavior of a cementitious composite subjected 

to carbonation.       

The comparison between uncarbonated samples UB vs. B indicated the toughness and Bulk 

Density of B was statistically higher than that of UB. The B samples tended to have higher bulk 

density, but lower AVV and WA than the UB samples. Alkaline attacks occur in both types of 

samples, resulting in mineralization that is caused by diffusion and precipitation of minerals 

rich in Ca. The literature indicates that the lignin, hemicelluloses, and pectin act as chemical 

and physical walls to the penetration of Ca2+ ions into the fibers (TONOLI et al., 2010). The 

bleached pulp has higher crystallinity and fewer amorphous components, which resulted on a 

stronger fiber-cement interface and a fewer barriers to the precipitation of Ca2+ ions, it other 

words the mineralization process.    

Effect of Accelerating Ageing Cycles:  The superior performance of carbonated samples 

persisted after 200 cycles of accelerated aging, with MOE of B-SC-48-2-AAC and B-AAC 

samples presenting 17% to 30% higher average values than aged B-SC-48-2 and B samples. 

Additionally, after accelerated aging, the average values of specific energy for the carbonated 

and uncarbonated composites decreased approximately 62% and 87%, respectively. Figure 17 

shows typical stress x strain curves during flexural tests of the composites reinforced with 

bleached pulp before and after accelerated ageing cycles. 

The physical properties of accelerated aging cycles were similar to those of the carbonation 

process, but with milder changes in bulk density which only increased by 5% after aging. This 

is a result of the aging process, during which CO2 causes the precipitation of calcium carbonate, 

but also because of the greater duration over which hydration can occur and produce hydration 

products that fill the cement-fiber matrix.

The supercritical carbonation treatment helped diminish the annihilation of macromolecular 

chains during the partial alkaline hydrolysis of the cellulose, which causes their rupture and the 

consequent reduction to the degree of polymerization. During soak and dry cycles, the fibers’ 

natural degradation occurs as the movement of the pore water towards the surface of the fibers 

is facilitated (SANTOS et al., 2015).

4.1.2. Thermogravimetric analysis 

Figure 18 depicts the mass loss (TG) and differential mass loss (DTG) of the different curing 

processes. The changes in the mass loss between 90 and 200°C corresponds to the C–S–H, 

ettringite (Aft), monosulfoaluminate (AFm) and monocarboaluminate (Mc). The mass loss in 

the range of 200 to 420°C corresponds to C3A and C4AF hydration products
 

(RAMACHANDRAN et al., 2001; SHA et al., 1999). Moreover, if water is more determinedly 

bonded in the C–S–H, it is even likely that some C–S–H dehydration will occur up to 300°C 

(RAMACHANDRAN et al., 1971). The most important hydration product of cement based 

materials is calcium silicate hydrate (C–S–H) gel (SANTOS et al., 2015; JENNINGS et al., 

2008; CHEN et al.,2004). The solid phase containing Ca2+ also contributes to calcite formation
 

(GARCIA-GONZALEZ et al., 2008), promoted by the accelerated carbonation through the 

adsorption of the CO2 by the cementitious matrix, as was also observed by Pizzol et al. (2014) 

and Almeida et al. (2013) under different curing conditions. 



 

 

 

80 

 

The researchers Bentur and Mindess (2007) noted that the cellulose phase in fiber-cement 

composites can be detected in the temperature interval between 295 and 370°C, corresponding 

to the degradation of the cellulose fibers. Figure 18 shows peaks at 340°C for UB and B 

samples, and at 350°C for UB-SC-48-2 and B-SC-48-2. For AAC samples it is possible to see 

an increase to mass loss at 360°C for B-AAC and B-SC-48-2-AAC conditions when compared 

to unaged samples, indicating the degradation of the cellulose fibers due to exposure to aged 

cycles.

According to Shaaban (1991), approximately 30% of Ca(OH)2 has potential to be carbonated 

during CO2 exposure in controlled environmental chambers. The estimated amount of mass loss 

of calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)2 (CH) and calcium carbonate CaCO3 (CC) is calculated 

following the procedure proposed by Borges et al. (2010) using the equations (14) and (15), 

which, considering increased molecular mass resulting from the carbonation process, as shown 



 

 

 

82 

 

in Table 15, would suggest an increase to the percentage of mass lost, confirmed in the 

thermogravimetric data (DTG) presented in Figure 18. Dehydroxylation, L1, occurs between 

450 and 500°C, the mass loss in this range decreases as the carbonation exposure time increases, 

and decarbonation losses, L2, occurs between 600–750°C. The initial amount of Ca(OH)2 may 

be directly calculated from Eq. (16). The corresponding amount of CaCO3 resulting from the 

total Ca(OH)2 that carbonated was estimated using Eq. (17).

Table 16 presents the estimated % Ca(OH)2 and % CaCO3 between the uncarbonated and 

carbonated conditions with different parameters. It is apparent that the effect of hydration time, 

the effect of carbonation exposure, and the effect of the cellulose pulp, did not influence the 

Ca(OH)2 and CaCO3 formation.  



 

 

 

83 

 

For the specimen submitted to 200 accelerated soak and dry aging cycles and carbonation (B-

SC-48-2-AAC), the results suggest an increase of calcium hydroxide and reduction of calcium 

carbonate compared with non-aged and carbonated samples (B-SC-48-2), for example at 476°C 

(Figure 18b) it is possible to estimate the amounts of Ca(OH)2 to be 4.5% and 0.57%, 

respectively. On the other hand, at 830°C estimated amounts of CaCO3 for the same conditions 

were 36,11% and 41,58%. This could be attributed to progress of hydration process of the 

cement.  

Hence, the supercritical accelerated carbonation increased the mass loss between 650 and 

750°C related to the decomposition of poorly crystalized CaCO3, as well as between 750 and 

850°C related to the decomposition of well-crystalized CaCO3, as reported by Rostami et al. 

(2012) and Pizzol et al. (2014). In all samples subjected to the carbonation regime, weight loss 

was observed at approx. 800°C which represents well-crystallized CaCO3.   

 According to Alvarez and Abanades (2005), the carbonation process of calcium hydroxide can 

generate carbonate polymorphs to be oxidized in the same temperature range, which explains 

the presence of a large peak around 830°C.  

 

4.1.3. X-ray diffraction analysis 

The XRD results shown in Figure 19 present the patterns for the eight sets of curing regimes.  

Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is the main mineralogical phase observed and the second phase is 

calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2). 

Four phases of calcium carbonate occur with increasing stability, amorphous calcium carbonate, 

vaterite, aragonite, and calcite (BLACK et al., 2007). In Figure 19, it is possible to observe the 

increase of the peak at 2? = 29.5° in supercritically carbonated samples (UB-SC-48-2, UB-SC-

24-2, B-SC-48-1, B-SC-48-2 and B-SC-48-2-AAC).  This corresponds to CaCO3 in the form 

of calcite (HUNNICUT, 2013), this increase is due to the primary reaction process of CO2 that 

dissolves into the matrix and reacts with hydration products, such as calcium hydroxide (CH) 

and calcium silicate hydrate (C–S–H), and also reacts with polymerized silica gel leading to 

secondary carbonation.  

Figure 19 compares the uncarbonated samples (UB, B and B-AAC) vs supercritical carbonated 

samples (UB-SC-48-2, UB-SC-24-2, B-SC-48-1, B-SC-48-2 and B-SC-48-2-AAC), there is a 

noticeable reduction of portlandite (around 2? = 18° or 35°) according to Pizzol et al. (2014) 



 

 

 

84 

 

and Santos et al. (2015).  The carbonation reactions and effects are the same as those described 

in the previous section for bleached and unbleached pulp samples.   

International Centre Diffraction Data (2003) and PANalytical HighScore Plus Inorganic Crystal 

Structure Database (2007) were applied to identify crystalline phases. The PANalytical 

HighScore Plus was used too for made a quantification estimative of the clinker phases, 

considering only the crystalline part of the material and excluding the amorphous part.

supercritical carbonation treatment. Cu K? radiation was used.

4.1.4. Evaluation of the changes in the microstructure 

Figures 20 and 21 present micrographs that were obtained by a SEM in Back-Scatter Electron 

mode (BSE) image detector operating at approximately 15.0 kV. The electron scattering is 

related to the atomic number.   

Previous studies have shown that accelerated carbonation enhanced the interface between 

cellulose and the cementitious matrix (PIZZOL et al., 2014; ALMEIDA  et al., 2013), which 

develops good mechanical anchorage and interlocking effects since carbonated composites are

denser and more compact, due to calcite filling the pores of the system (PIZZOL et al., 2014). 

Carbonated composites micrographs emphasize the difference between cellulose pulp at the 

adhesion fibers-matrix.  Arrow 1 in Figure 20 shows the cracks and pores observed in the 

cement matrix surrounding the unbleached cellulose fibers; as a result, during mechanical 

testing, the deficient fiber-matrix interface is linked to weaker mechanical properties 

(SAVASTANO et al., 2003; SAVASTANO et al., 2005). The carbonation process is 

accompanied with a reduction to the pH of the matrix, although the accelerated carbonation did 

not avoid the mineralization process inside the cellulose fibers, as shown by arrow 2 in Figure 

20. 

The carbonated composite shows unbleached cellulose fiber agglomeration (arrow 3 in Figure 

20). On the other hand, the bleached fibers in the carbonated composites had improved fiber–

matrix interfaces with the cellulose when compared to the unbleached fibers (Arrow 4 in Figure 

21 compared to arrow 1 in Figure 20). Nevertheless, bleached fiber presents the mineralization 

process inside the cellulose fibers, as shown by arrow 5 in Figure 21. Homogeneous distribution 

of the of eucalyptus fibers over the matrix is noted by arrow 6 on Figure 21.  In summary, the 

carbonated bleached fiber-reinforced composites presented better fiber distribution, improved 

fiber-matrix adhesion and mechanical behavior, than carbonated unbleached fiber-reinforced 

composites.

4.2. Stage 3: Comparative study between two kinds of mineral addition in cellulose pulp 

fiber-cement composites subjected to accelerated carbonation at very early age. 

4.2.1. Mechanical and physical characteristics of stage 3 

Table 17 presents a summary of the average values and corresponding standard deviation of the 

physical results (AVV, BD and WA) and the mechanical results (MOR, LOP, MOE and SE), 

respectively for all curing scenarios of the stage 3.  

The student’s t-test was conducted to a confidence level of 95%. By analyzing the physical and 

mechanical property results for the four curing regimes we can isolate the influence of hydration 

time (10 h vs. 24 h); the mineral addition effect (Limestone vs. Silica) and the four conditions 

in carbonation processes (20% CO2). For example, to evaluate the effect of the mineral addition 

on the properties of the matrix, specimen’s properties were compared between curing regimes: 

P-LAC-10 vs. P-AC-10 and P-LAC-24 vs. P-AC-24.  The average values represent an average 

of all measurements and exclude the outliers (spurious) values.  A ‘0’ in Table 18 averages that 

there is no statistically significant difference between the averages, ‘+’ indicates that there is a 

statistically significant difference between the average with the first listed condition having a 

higher average than the second, and ‘-’ indicates the first listed condition had a lower average 

than the second.

The effect of the Mineral addition: To compare the effect of the carbonation curing phase on 

the specimens, a comparison of the properties of the following curing regimes was examined:  

P-LAC-10 vs. P-AC-10 and P-LAC-24 vs. P-AC-24 (Figure 22). Comparing the four curing 

regimes, as shown in Table 18, the effect of the mineral addition on the samples P-LAC-24 vs. 

P-AC-24 had an effect on the specimen’s, resulted in average values of MOR, LOP, MOE, and 

SE of the composition of the silica were 24%, 46%, 25% and 32%. This could be attributed to 

the difference in enhancing the hydration of the clinker as a result of the mineral addition effect; 

the fine particle size distribution of the limestone, influence on the chemistry or the packing 

(HAWKINS et al., 2003), as well to be high affinity between calcium aluminate and carbonate 

phases to form monocarbonate (FELDMAN et al. 1965; BENSTED, 1980). The performance 

of limestone-cementitious materials is impacted by all main aggressive species (sulfates, 

chlorides, carbonation) and main pathologies (freezing-thawing, ASR, corrosion). On the other 

hand, the use of silica particles to substitute clinker particles, led to more available space for 

the hydrates of the clinker phases to form, and it is considering for the heterogeneous 

precipitation and growth of hydrates (SCRIVENER et al., 2015) and as an inner mineral 

addition it seems that there is almost no influence on the heat evolution curve during the 

acceleration period (LOTHENBACH et al., 2011). In both cementitious matrices, the presence 

of CO2 during the curing period (early carbonation) led to disappearing of calcium hydroxide 

(portlandite—P). The CH and C–S–H become carbonated simultaneously. The initial rate of 

carbonation is quite similar, but while C–S–H is still carbonating, CH carbonation slows down 

and stops. This is due to the fact that CH becomes less and more accessible for carbonation 

front (MORANDEAU et al., 2014; TONOLI et al., 2016).  

Effect of Hydration Time:  To compare the effect of the carbonation curing phase on the 

specimens, a comparison of the properties of the following curing regimes was examined:  P-

LAC-10 vs. P-LAC-24 and P-AC-10 vs. P-AC-24. Comparing the four curing regimes, as 

shown in Table 18, increasing the hydration time from 10 h to 24 h had no effect on the 

specimen’s bulk density, modulus of rupture and modulus of elasticity.

4.2.2. X-ray diffraction analysis 

Figure 23 presents the XRD patterns for the four different sets of curing and formulations 

conditions. Calcium carbonate (calcite) is the main mineralogical phase observed in the 

carbonated samples due to the presence of the calcium carbonate, the second phase is calcium 

hydroxide (Portlandite) observed at a much lower rate. Figure 23 compares the carbonated 

samples using different mineral additions, Limestone (P-LAC-10 and P-LAC-24) vs Silica (P-

AC-10 and P-AC-24). There is a noticeable absence of portlandite (around 2? = 18° or 36°) and 



 

 

 

91 

 

the notorious peak around 2? = 26.6°, correspond to the silica type quartz, in the samples with 

silica mineral addition.  

In Figure 23, it is possible to observe the increase of the peak at 2? = 29.5° in all carbonated 

samples. This corresponds to CaCO3 in the form of calcite (TONOLI et al., 2016), this increase 

is due to the primary reaction process of CO2 that dissolves into the matrix and reacts with 

hydration products, such as calcium hydroxide (CH) and calcium silicate hydrate (C–S–H), and 

also reacts with polymerized silica gel leading to secondary carbonation.

Figure 24 shows estimated percentages of calcium hydroxide (Portlandite), calcium carbonate

Plus. The estimated percentages correspond to the crystalline percent of the material and did 

not take into account the amorphous percent of the material.

The percent quantification and formation of each one those phases on limestone composites 

subjected to carbonation curing depends mostly on two main chemical processes: primarily the 

dissolution of Ca(OH)2, which releases Ca
2+ and OH- ions, and precipitates forming calcium 

carbonate (CaCO3). Even though the carbonation process reduces the amount of portlandite, 

this phase was not completely consumed in the limestone composite, as shown in Figure 24, 

nevertheless the principal component, with significantly greater quantities, is calcium 

carbonate. Secondly, the calcium carbonate formation is attributed to the reduction of Ca/Si in 

calcium silicate hydrate gel, as well from other solid phases containing Ca2+. The progressive 

decalcification ultimately leads to S–H and CaCO3. This reaction process between CO2 and the 

C–S–H produces CaCO3 and a polymerised silica gel (SANTOS et al., 2015; FERNANDEZ-

BERTOS et al., 2004).

Figure 25 shows estimated percentages of calcium hydroxide (Portlandite), calcium carbonate 

(Calcite), tricalcium silicate (alite), dicalcium silicate (belita) and quartz, also determined using 

the software PANalytical HighScore Plus. As was previously mentioned, these estimated 

percentages correspond to the phases of crystalline amount of the material and did not take into 

account the amorphous amount of the material.  

In this case, the principal component of the matrix is the quartz, instead of CaCO3. The presence 

of quartz (SiO2) is due to the inert mineral addition used, silica. In this composite, it is 

considered the total reduction of portlandite, because it is around 3%, clarify that is the percent 

correspond to the quantification of the crystalline part of the composite. In other words, with

compact, and have improved contact between cellulosic fibers and the cement matrix, when 

compared to uncarbonated cementitious matrices (SAVASTANO AND AGOPYAN, 1999). 

The EDS analysis allows to see the differences between these composites, which are the 

chemical components; on limestone composites, it is well known and previously discussed that 

the porosity is sufficiently high to permit constant CO2 diffusion, therefore the CH is further 

reduced and the interlayer calcium from C–S–H also reacts with carbon dioxide, as a result the 

main composite is CaCO3 and secondary composite is silicate gel (FERNÁNDEZ-BERTOS et 

al., 2004). (Fig. 26 and Fig. 27) In both cases the microstructure is compact and formed by 

layered structures, (cross1 in Fig. 26 and Fig. 27) likely related to the C–S–H phases. These 

results corroborate with the higher content of CaCO3 (cross 2 in Fig. 26), observed in the XRD 

quantification of the crystalline part of the limestone material. Across 3, Fig. 27 presents the 

main component of this composite that is the quartz.

4.3. Stage 4: Durability and hydration kinetics study in carbonated fiber-cement 

composites using silica as a mineral addition. 

4.3.1. Mechanical and Physical Properties of stage 4 

Table 19 presents a summary of the average values and corresponding coefficient of variation 

(COV) of the physical properties (AVV, BD and WA) and the mechanical properties (MOR, 

LOP, MOE and SE), respectively for all curing scenarios.  

The student’s t-test was conducted to a confidence level of 95%. By analyzing the physical and 

mechanical property results for the eight curing regimes we can isolate the influence of 

hydration time (10 h vs. 24 h); carbonation processes (atmospheric CO2 level (0.035%) vs. 20% 

CO2); and also the degradation performance by way of exposure to accelerated ageing (soak-

dry) cycles (no cycles vs. 200 cycles). To evaluate the effect of the hydration time duration on 

the properties of the matrix, the following comparisons are assessed: P-UC-10 vs. P-UC-24; P-

AC-10 vs P-AC-24; P-UC-10-AAC vs. P-UC-24-AAC; and P-AC-10-AAC vs. P-AC-24-AAC. 

A summary of the statistical significance testing is reported in Table 20 for the physical and 

mechanical properties.  The average values represent an average of all measurements and 

exclude the outliers (spurious) values. A ‘0’ in the table averages that there is no statistically 

significant difference between the averages, ‘+’ indicates that there is a statistically significant 

difference between the means with the first listed condition having a higher average than the 

second, and ‘-’ indicates the first listed condition had a lower average than the second.

Effect of Hydration Time:  To compare the effect of the carbonation curing phase on the 

specimens a comparison of the properties of the following curing regimes is examined: P-UC-

10 vs. P-UC-24; P-AC-10 vs. P-AC-24; P-UC-10-AAC vs. P-UC-241-AAC; and P-AC-10-

AAC vs. P-AC-24-AAC. Considering eight curing regimes as shown in Table 19, the effect of 

increasing the hydration time from 10 h to 24 h had no effect on the specimen’s bulk density, 

modulus of rupture and modulus of elasticity. However, when comparing specimens subjected 

to the accelerated ageing cycles, the limit of proportionally was affected, whereby, a longer 

hydration time (24 h) resulted in a higher LOP for both the uncarbonated (P-UC-10-AAC and 

P-UC-24-AAC) specimens, as well as the carbonated specimens (P-AC-10-AAC and P-AC-

24-AAC). The difference of LOP could be due to the progression of the hydration process 

(TONOLI et a., 2009). Another factor that could influence the initial hydration duration time 

was the mineral addition effect, in this case the silica, allows the heterogeneous precipitation 

and growth of hydrates (SCRIVENER et al., 2015).  

 

Effect of Exposure to Carbonation Curing:  To evaluate the effect of the carbonation curing 

phase on the specimens a comparison of the properties of the following curing regimes is 

examined:  P-UC-10 vs. P-AC-10; P-UC-24 vs. P-AC-24; P-UC-10-AAC vs. P-AC-10-AAC; 

and P-UC-24-AAC vs. P-AC-24-AAC. Examination of the measurements in Table 19 reveals 

that for all specimens, exposure to carbonation curing increased the mechanical properties, 

namely, the modulus of rupture, limit of proportionality and the modulus of elasticity, compared 

to the specimens that were not subjected to carbonation.  For the case of specimens without 

exposure to the accelerated ageing cycles, the statistical analysis reveals that the high 

concentration of CO2 (20%) exposure resulted in a statistically significant difference in all 

physical and mechanical properties.  The average values of LOP and MOE show indirectly that 

there is an improvement in the fibre-matrix interface caused by carbonation processes in the 

early stage of curing, and furthermore, after exposure to 200 soak-dry cycles. Almeida et al. 

(2010) and Pizzol et al. (2014) studied cement based specimens reinforced with eucalyptus 

cellulosic pulp subjected to accelerated carbonation curing (AC) resulting in an increase of 

matrix resistance to the crack propagation, if compared to uncarbonated fibre–cement. The 

mechanical improvement was attributed to the elimination of calcium hydroxide due to the 

carbonation treatment, that creates a microstructure with more strength-contributing solids than 

conventional hydration (PIZZOL et al., 2014; ROSTAMI et al., 2012; ALMEIDA et al., 2013).

Specimens of carbonated specimens (AC) were compared to the uncarbonated (UC) specimens 

after they were exposed to the accelerated ageing cycles. The specimens P-UC-10-AAC and P-

UC-24-AAC have greater mean apparent porosity values, and lower mechanical performance 

compared to P-AC-10-AAC and P-AC-24-AAC respectively. CaCO3 is precipitated in the pore 

structure of the composite, filling the voids and through blocking the absorption of water due 

to the decrease of pore size (HYVERT et al., 2010). 

According with Santos et al. (2015), the fibre-matrix interactions are dependent on physical and 

chemical adhesion, shear stress resistance and mechanical anchorage induced by overall 

complex geometry and orientation effects of the cellulosic fibres. Unbleached pine fibre is low 

density and hydrophilic. Therefore, the amount of water absorbed by this fibre depends on the 

void volume and the amount of cellulose material present; both parameters have an effect upon 

density of the matrix (COUTTS, 1995).   

Effect of Accelerating Ageing Cycles:  To evaluate the effect of the accelerated ageing soak-

dry cycles on the properties of the specimens, the following curing regimes are compared: P-

UC-10 vs. P-UC-10-AAC; P-UC-24 vs. P-UC-24-AAC; P-AC-10 vs. P-AC-10-AAC; and P-

AC-24 vs. P-AC-24-AAC.  No clear trends are apparent when examining the average 

mechanical properties or physical properties of specimens subjected to 200 soak-dry cycles 

compared to specimens that were not submitted to the aging cycles.  In some cases, the 

mechanical properties are greater for the specimens subjected to the accelerated ageing cycles, 

but in other cases they are not.  In some cases, the difference of the mean properties between 

samples exposed and not exposed to 200 soak-dry cycles is statistically significantly different, 

but in other cases it is not, as shown in Table 20. However, close examination of the data in 

Table 20, representing the physical and mechanical properties, reveals that the vegetable fibre 

-cement composite can exhibit good durability properties even after being subjected to 200 

soak-dry ageing cycles. For example, the range in modulus of rupture of samples not exposed 

to any ageing cycles compared to those exposed to 200 ageing cycles is 6.49 to 10.9 MPa, and 

6.17 to 9.39 MPa respectively. The range in limit of proportionality of samples not exposed to 

any ageing cycles compared to those exposed to 200 ageing cycles is 2.84 to 5.19 MPa, and 

3.76 to 6.51 MPa respectively. The range in the elastic modulus of samples exposed to no ageing 

cycles compared to those exposed to 200 ageing cycles is 7022 to 10325 MPa, and 8705 to 

11936 MPa respectively.  Therefore, it is clear, the range in mechanical properties of specimens 

exposed to accelerated soak-dry cycles is within a similar range as that of the specimens that 

have not been subjected to any soak-dry cycles.

The accelerated carbonation treatment interferes with the reduce of the destruction 

macromolecular chains during the partial alkaline hydrolysis of the cellulose, which causes their 

rupture and the consequent decrease in the degree of polymerisation. Also, this treatment is a 

gradual process of filling up the inner cores of the vegetable fibres with the hydration products 

that leads to the embrittlement of the reinforcement (MELO FILHO et al., 2013). Furthermore, 

a it was proposed that on carbonated composites the toughening mechanisms were better 

preserved the fracture process (SANTOS et al., 2015). Nevertheless, judging by the results of 

both composites, carbonated and uncarbonated, was found that the mechanical properties were 

maintained and this could be attribute to the use of an inert filler in the cementitious matrix.  

The use of an inert mineral addition as ground silica allows to isolate the effect of the 

accelerated carbonation curing process on cementitious composites, but it also seems to work 

as appropriate strategy to mitigate degradation of the composite, even for air curing (with no 

autoclave) condition. In conjunction with the use of unbleached pine fiber, it works for the good 

interfacial fibre-matrix bonding strength and lower vulnerability of the fiber for degradation in 

the cement matrix (COOKE, 2000; SANTOS et al., 2015). The typical stress x strain curves of 

the composites are shown at Figure 28 before and after accelerated ageing cycles for 10 h of 

initial hydration; and Figure 29 before and after accelerated ageing cycles for 24 h of initial 

hydration. Comparing specimens subjected to the accelerated ageing cycles, the specific energy 

affected, whereby, a longer hydration time (24 h) resulted in a higher SE for the carbonated 

specimens (P-AC-24-AAC); but a short hydration time (10 h) resulted in a higher MOR for the 

carbonated specimen (P-AC-10-AAC)

4.3.2. Thermogravimetry analysis (TG/DTG)  

The comparison of the mechanical properties of the uncarbonated and carbonated samples 

before and after accelerated aging cycles shows statistically significant improvement of the 

carbonated samples due to the carbonation reaction. The efficiency of the carbonation reaction 

was evaluated for the eight sets of curing regimes, through the differential thermogravimetry 

analysis (DTG).   

The most important hydration product of cementitious composites is still calcium silicate 

hydrate (C–S–H) gel (CHEN et al., 2004; SHI et al., 2009) and it is responsible for most of the 

properties of cement-based materials (SANTOS et al., 2015). For the carbonation process, the 

dissolution of Ca(OH)2 generally takes place more readily, while decalcification of C–S–H 

occurs when Ca(OH)2 is inaccessible or locally reduced (FERNANDEZ-BERTOS et al., 2004), 

it is known as secondary carbonation process (FERNANDEZ-BERTOS et al., 2004). On DTG 

Figure 30a and Figure 30b there is a clear difference between uncarbonated (UC) and 

carbonated (AC) conditions; the AC conditions presents a lower mass loss between 0°C and 

240°C compared with the UC conditions, this is attributed to the formation of different phases. 

The abrupt mass loss between 105 and 150°C is evident in the uncarbonated (UC) samples; the 

DTG curve indicates C-S-H and ettringite dehydration (RAMACHANDRAN et al., 2001). In 

addition, in the UC samples, a weight loss at approximately 180°C is observed, indicating the 

presence of monosulfate (LOTHENBACH et al., 2008). Also, the UC conditions presents a 

higher mass loss between 105 and 420°C compared with the UC conditions, this range 

represents the loss of combined water due to dehydration of (C–S–H), aluminate hydrate and 

ferroaluminate hydrate (RAMACHANDRAN et al., 2001; SHA et al., 1999; SHARMA et al., 

1999). 

Bentur and Mindess (2007), observed that cellulose phase in fiber-cement composites  detected 

in the temperature interval 295 - 370°C corresponding to the degradation of the cellulose fibers. 

Exposure of specimens to elevated levels of carbon dioxide is known to be one mechanism to 

minimize cellulose fibre degradation in the fibre-cement products. The beneficial effects on the 

mechanical and physical properties were apparently.  The mass loss in the range of 295 - 370°C 

could be related to the degradation of the fibre as a result of the soak-dry cycles, in particular 

at 340°C for the specimen P-AC-10-AAC (Figure 30a) have a higher peak compare with P-AC-

24-AAC (Figure 30b) at 350°C.

One potential mechanism of degradation which has been reported in the literature is the 

mineralization of the cellulose fibres, which is produced by the free ions from the dissolution 

of Portland cement phases that penetrate into the fibre cavity (lumen).  This is the principal 

reason for the re-precipitation of calcium hydroxide into the fibre. This re-precipitation of solids 

into the fibre voids induces the embrittlement of the cellulose fibres (MOHR et al., 2005; 

MOHR et al., 2006). This influences significant losses in mechanical properties in the long-

term and has specifically been observed in vegetable fibre-cement composites after natural or 

accelerated ageing (e.g. soak/dry cycling), due to the degradation mechanisms of cellulose 

fibres in the cementitious environment (MOHR et al., 2005; TONOLI et al., 2009).  

Table 21 presents the TG results by way of quantifying the mass loss percentage of carbonation 

precipitate.  According with Borges et al. (2010), the increase in molar mass with carbonation 

process, allows inferring an increase in the percentage of mass lost. The amount of calcium 

hydroxide (CH) and calcium carbonate (CC) was determined using the molar mass balance, 

since that 74 g/mol, 44 g/mol, 100 g/mol and 18 g/mol are the molar masses of Ca(OH)2, CO2, 

CaCO3 and H2O respectively. Using the method of Borges et al. (2010), withthe equations (14) 

and (15). Dehydroxylation, L1, occurs between 450 and 500°C, the mass loss in this range 

decreases as the carbonation exposure time increases, and decarbonation losses, L2, occurs 

between 600–750°C. The initial amount of Ca(OH)2 may be directly calculated from Eq. (16).

From Table 21 comparing the %CH and %CC between the uncarbonated and carbonated 

samples with different initial hydration durations (10 h v. 24 h), it is apparent that the hydration 

time did not influence the Ca(OH)2 and CaCO3 formation. In all samples subjected to the 

carbonation regime, it was observed weight loss at approximately 800°C, which represents 

well-crystallized CaCO3.  According to Alvarez et al. (2005), this indicates that the carbonation 



 

 

 

106 

 

process of calcium hydroxide can generate carbonate polymorphs that may be oxidized in the 

same region.  Considering the relatively weak peak located at 758°C of the uncarbonated 

samples (P-UC-10 and P-UC-24) in Figure 30a, it suggests only the initial carbon content in as-

received cement.  This observation is also supported by other researchers such as Rostami et al. 

(2011). 

For the samples under accelerated carbonated conditions, it was observed a considerable 

decrease in the peak at 470°C indicating the CH consumption due to carbonation, what can 

surely contribute to the dimensional stabilization of the composite and to the alkalinity 

reduction of the cement matrix (PIZZOL et al., 2014). Contrarily, the uncarbonated samples 

show a much greater peak at the same region, which infers a highly alkaline composite. The 

increase or decrease of these peaks indicate the alkalinity of the matrix, as well as the reaction 

with phenolphthalein on carbonated composites indicates the composite to be less alkaline. In 

contrast, the phenolphthalein on the uncarbonated samples is measured to be more alkaline, 

with a relatively above pH (8.5).

4.3.3. FTIR spectrometer analysis 

FTIR analysis results are shown in Figure 31 and Figure 32 for specimens with initial hydration 

of 10 h and initial hydration of 24 h, that were not subjected to ageing cycles and those that 

were exposed to 200 soak-dry cycles respectively.  The results reveal that the calcium carbonate 

was present in all carbonated samples. In both Figures 31 and 32, a band in the region of 1,300 

to 1,700 cm-1 is observed, which some researchers have linked to carbonation processes 

(YLMÉN et al., 2013). For the specimens, P-AC-10 and P-AC-10-AAC, presents peaks at 879, 

1085, 1427, 1794 and 2505 cm-1 can be observed in all of the spectra and were assigned to 



 

 

 

107 

 

CaCO3. In a CO2 rich atmosphere there is a noticeable decline in Ca(OH)2, seen as a dip at 

3,632 cm-1 in Fig. 31. For the specimen, P-AC-24-AAC (Figure 32), presents peaks at 884, 

1089, 1443, 1799 and 2505 cm-1 can be observed in all of the spectra and were assigned to 

CaCO3.  There is also a dip at 3,643 cm
-1 due to a decreased amount of Ca(OH)2 in Fig. 32 the 

sample P-AC-24. (BJÖRNSTRÖM, 2005; DELGADO et al., 1996; YU et al., 1999). In fibre–

cement with a reasonable amount of CH, the principal carbonation product is calcite from 

higher carbonation rate of CH and C–S–H. (YLMÉN et al., 2013, SANTOS et al., 2015).  

There is also a dip at *950–1,100 cm-1 corresponding to the peaks for C–S–H in all the samples 

spectrum in Figure 31 and Figure 32. Some transformations of sulfates appear to occur, 

emphasized by a shift in absorbance of the S–O stretching between 1,100 and 1,200 cm-1. The 

spectrum of the product fits well with that of ettringite. In this experiment this was not observed 

sulfate phases, such as ettringite, this can be concluded because there are no observable 

signatures of the calcium sulfate species, such as gypsum, formed as a byproduct of the 

carbonation (GROUNDS et al., 1988; XIANTUO AND RUIZHEN, 1994).

4.3.4. X-ray diffraction analysis 

The XRD results shown in Figure 33 presents the patterns of the four sets of curing regimes 

correspond to 24 h of initial hydration. Through the XRD analysis, it was possible to identify 

the main phases of the composite. Calcium carbonate (calcite) is the main mineralogical phase 

observed in the uncarbonated samples due to the presence of the calcium carbonate, the second 

phase is calcium hydroxide (portlandite), third phase is quartz due to the mineral addition in the 

composition, the fourth is tricalcium silicate (alite) and the last one is dicalcium silicate (belita). 

The remaining cement anhydrous phase, such as alite (C3S) and belite (C2S) are detected after 

seven days of thermal curing (Figure 33). Four phases of calcium carbonate can take place with 

increasing stability, amorphous calcium carbonate, vaterite, aragonite, and calcite (BLACK et 

al., 2007). It is observed the reduction of the amorphous background (broad band between 2? 

= 25–40°C) from the uncarbonated to the carbonated composite, which means an increase of 

the crystallinity of the phases. In Figure 33, it is possible to observe the increase of the peak 2? 

= 29.5° in the conditions P-AC-24 and P-AC-24-AAC this corresponds to calcite, due the 

primary reaction process of CO2 that dissolves into the matrix and reacts with hydration 

products, such as calcium hydroxide (CH) and calcium silicate hydrate (C–S–H), and also reacts 



 

 

 

109 

 

with polymerized silica gel is known as secondary carbonation. Other CaCO3 polymorphs 

(vaterite—Va and aragonite—Ar) were not detected. 

The uncarbonated samples (P-UC-24, and P-UC-24-AAC) presented a higher intensity in the 

region of 2? = 18° corresponding to the portlandite (calcium hydroxide) (ALMEIDA et al., 

2013). The carbonation process in the early stages of hydration resulted in the decrease of 

portlandite, as shown by the lower intensity of the characteristic peak of the carbonated samples. 

Another important peak 2? = 26.6°, correspond to the silica type quartz.

The figures 34 and 34 show the estimative amount of the identified phases, following it is 

mentioned a few global crystallographic parameters of each identified phase are: calcite 

(CaCO3), with reference cod 969009669, have a hexagonal crystallographic structure and the 

space group number of R -3c (167) (SITEPU et al., 2005); the portlandita Ca(OH)2, with a 

reference cod 969000114, corresponds to hexagonal crystallographic structure and the space 

group number of P-3 m 1 (164) (HERNDERSON et al., 1962); the alite, with a reference cod 

990010019, compound name 1540705, correspond to monoclinic crystallographic system and 

the space group number of C 1 m 1 (8) (DE LA TORRE et al., 2002); the belite, with a reference 

cod 969012790, correspond to monoclinic crystallographic system and the space group number 



 

 

 

110 

 

of P 1 21/c 1 (14) (TSURUMI et al., 1994); the quarzt, with a reference cod 962100189, 

corresponds to hexagonal crystallographic structure and the space group number of P 31 2 1 

(152) (CASPI et al., 2005).  

Figure 34 and Figure 35 shows estimated percentages of calcium hydroxide (Portlandite), 

calcium carbonate (Calcite), tricalcium silicate (alite), dicalcium silicate (belita) and quartz, 

were determined using the software PANalytical HighScore Plus for the samples in the initial 

ages P-UC-24 and P-AC-24, and after ageing P-UC-24-AAC and P-AC-24-AAC.  

These estimated percentages correspond to the crystalline content of the material and didn’t 

take into account the amorphous content of the material. The XRD patterns without (Figure 

34a) and after (Figure 34b) carbonation indicated at AC condition, the calcium hydroxide (CH) 

was reduced 17.4% as well the belite was reduced 3.3%, these phases took part on the primary 

and secondary carbonation process, respectively (SANTOS et al., 2015; FERNANDEZ-

BERTOS et al., 2004). A very similar situation was related with the increase of the calcite, 

corresponding to 23%.  

These estimated percentages correspond to the crystalline amount of the material and didn’t 

take into account the amorphous content of the material. The XRD patterns of before (Figure 

35a) and after (Figure 35b) carbonation both after accelerated aging cycles indicates at AC 

condition, the calcium hydroxide (CH) was reduce 18.5% as well the belite 2.5%, this phases 

made part of the primary and secondary carbonation process, respectively (SANTOS et al., 

2015; FERNANDEZ-BERTOS et al., 2004). In this case, the increase of the calcite corresponds 

to 31.7%.  

It is possible to compare the amount of CH of 19.2% (Figure 34a) and 21% (Figure 35a) with 

1.8% (Figure 34b) and 2.5% (Figure 35b), which is related to the decrease of alkalinity of the 

matrix. In the XRD analysis, for a crystallinity quantification, it is considered that below of 3% 

it is not a significant percentage for an identified phase.  

By the other hand, in all the composites the main phase is the quartz and this phase presents a 

reduction on carbonated composites compared with uncarbonated ones. Also, the calcium 

carbonate is not the principal phase on the carbonated samples but in the section 3.1, 

Mechanical and physical properties, the carbonated composites present a statistically 

significantly better mechanical behavior than the uncarbonated composites. This improvement 

could be attributed to the reduction of the alkalinity and the amount of calcium carbonate 

formatted during the accelerated curing process.

4.3.5. Microstructure of the composites by SEM 

Micrographs were obtained by a SEM in Back-Scattered Electron Image (BSEI) mode for the 

observation of the morphological features of cut and polished surfaces of composites subjected 

to uncarbonated and early age carbonated composites, both after 200 accelerated aging cycles, 

P-UC-24 and P-AC-24 (Figure 36 a,b), P-UC-24-AAC and P-AC-24-AAC (Figure 37 a,b). All 

the images have an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. The SEM micrographs shown are typical 

images of the microstructure chosen from around six representative images for each composite 

treatment. 

Figure 36 depicts cracks (arrow 1) and a more porous matrix is observed in the uncarbonated 

composite, due the initial porosity of a fiber-cement matrix, especially because of the 

production by the slurry-dewatering and significant volume of fibers, which eases the 



 

 

 

113 

 

penetration of CO2 in the composite (TONOLI et al., 2010). The cement matrix of the 

carbonated composite is denser and compact (Figure 36b).  

  The uncarbonated composite shows the heterogeneous and distribution of unbleached 

cellulose fiber (arrow 2 in Figure 36a).  Arrow 3 in Figure 36a presents cracks surrounding the 

cellulose fiber, which are the indicative of a weak contact between cellulose fibers and matrix. 

The deficient fiber-matrix interface is linked to lower mechanical properties (SAVASTANO et 

al., 2003; SAVASTANO et al., 2005). However, some fibers in the uncarbonated composites 

present good contact with the cement matrix (arrow 4 in Figure 36a), this could be attributed to 

the use of an inert mineral addition, silica, have good packing effect due to the 28% of filler 

using in the formulation. The accelerated carbonated process is refining the porosity of the 

cement matrix and improving the contact between cellulosic fibers and the matrix, and possibly 

favoring the better adhesion between them (arrow 5 in Figure 36b) (PIZZOL et al., 2014). The 

accelerated carbonation did not avoid some mineralization inside of the cellulose fibers, as 

shown by arrow 6 in Figure 36b. 

Figure 37 shows the uncarbonated and carbonated composite both after accelerated ageing 

cycles. The water absorption of natural fiber has a direct influence on the reinforcing 

performance and durability of the fiber in the cement matrix (WEI et al., 2015). At uncarbonated 

and aged composite, the fibers present creep, due the fibers absorb water, accompanied by 

volume expansion, from the soak and drying cycles (arrow 7 in Figure 37a). Before and after 

the aging cycles the uncarbonated composite depicts cracks and a more porous matrix than the 

carbonated composite (arrow 8 in Figure 37a). At early ages in the carbonated composites it is 

observed the improved fiber–matrix interface of the cellulose fibers and the diminutive porosity 

at the interface between aggregate particles and cement matrix. According to Farahi et al. (2013) 

and Almeida et al. (2013) precipitation of the calcium carbonate during carbonation is formed 

favorably at the aggregate-matrix interface, since this area is generally the most porous and thus 

weakest zone in the cement composites. After the aging cycles present some crack propagation 

in the carbonated composite (arrow 9 Figure 37b). However, most of the fibers do not present 

rupture (arrow 10 Figure 37b) it means that after the cycles, the energy is still absorbed by the 

composite due to the frictional slipping process during the pulling-out of fibers giving a good 

interface with the matrix (FARAHI et al., 2013).

Figure 38 and 39 present typical SEM micrographs of uncarbonated and carbonated samples 

that were obtained by SEM in Back-Scattered Electron Image (BSEI) mode. Figure 38 shows 

the composite before carbonation (P-UC-24), EDS analyses depict strong peaks of Ca and Si. 

The high content of the selected elements indicates the presence of quartz (Fig. 38 b-1), typical 

amorphous C–S–H (Figure 38 b-2), crystalline CH (Fig. 38 b-3) and CH into the fiber cavity 

(lumen) (Fig. 38 b-4) after complete seven days of thermal hydration process. 



 

 

 

115 

 

Figure 39 shows the composite after carbonation (P-AC-24). Generally, the carbonated 

composite has finer texture compared to the uncarbonated sample (P-UC-24 in Fig. 38). While 

the corresponding XRD pattern suggests formation of carbon products, the SEM picture does 

not provide any evidence of the crystalline form of carbonates. However, it is observed 

relatively high carbon content can be distinguished into the fiber cavity (lumen) based on the 

Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) spot analysis (Fig. 39 b-4). The biggest amount of 

carbon in fiber cavity correspond to the main element of the organic constitution of the fiber.  

The EDS analysis of the spots shown reveals strong intensities of Ca, Si, O and C (Figure 39 

b1-4), suggesting the presence of a hybrid of hydrates and carbonates. Comparison of relative 

intensities of carbon and oxygen in Fig. 4.12 with those in Fig. 39 suggests that O/C is evidently 

greater in the P-AC-24 sample. Similar result was found by Rostami et al., (2012).   

Figure 39b-2 carbonation of C–S–H, whatever seems to be even more dependent on the 

permeability of the matrix. Fast decalcification of C–S–H is expected in highly permeable 

composite, accompanied by carbonation shrinkage, which is accelerated when the CaO:SiO2 

molar ratio (C/S) is reduced below 1.2 (CHEN et al., 2006). Also, suggesting carbonation 

modified C–S–H is Si-rich but its binding capacity by Ca–O structure is maintained (ROSTAMI 

et al., 2012). Figure 39 b-1 is related to the silica hydrated; the remaining silica gives an 

absorption profile resembling condensed silica (YLMÉN et al., 2008).

4.3.6. Specific surface area 

The specific surface area of hardened cementitious composite indicates the amount of 

accessible fine pores (THOMAS et al., 1999). The surface area of well-hydrated cement 

composite as measured using water vapor, is remarkably consistent values between 100 and 

200 m2/g of dry cementitious composite (RARICK et al., 1996; THOMAS et al., 1999).  BET

method includes internal surfaces present in microcracks or in open pores at only one end 

(TAYLOR, 1990).  

Evaluated according to the BET method detailed in Section 3.3.3.7, experimental specific 

surface areas for the eight paste mixtures in this study are reported in Table 22. The BET specific 

surface area values for specimens stored in air curing, range from 39 to 57 m2/g in the initial 

ages and range from 37 to 50 after aging cycles. Unaged samples present bigger specific surface 

area than the aged samples. The carbonated samples present bigger specific surface area than 

the uncarbonated samples, due the carbonation of portlandite is manifested by the crystallisation 

of numerous calcite crystals on the portlandite platelets (CHRISTOPHE et al., 2006; PHAM 

AND PRINCE, 2014). The greatest specific surface area was for the condition P-AC-24 follow 

by the P-AC-10, but these two composites had a pore structure less accessible to water vapor 

in comparison to the other regimes as it shows at table 19 the physical properties.

4.4.  Stage 5: Evolution of the hydration kinetics on unbleached cellulose pulp fiber-

cement composites subjected to accelerated carbonation at very early age 

4.4.1. Thermogravimetry (TG) analyse and X-ray diffraction analyse  

Along 10 h with the eleven sets of samples it is possible to evaluate the kinetics of carbonation 

through the differential thermogravimentric analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetry analysis 

(TG), corresponding to Figure 40, 41 and Figure 42.  According to the literature, the mass loss 

at 100°C is associated to the escape of the pore water. The peak temperatures depend on the 

technique and amount present, and probably on the degree of crystallinity,  being typically 

shifted to 180-190°C for the material present in cement composites. DTA curves have been 

reported for other AFm phases (TAYLOR, 1990). But the absence of ettringite (AFt) peaks from 

an XRD pattern at Figure 43, could be a proof that this phase may not be formed in the fiber-

cement carbonated composite that use silica as a mineral addition. This could be beneficial 

considering that ettringite (AFt) formation has been previously suggested as one of the 

degradation mechanisms of cellulose pulp fiber into cement matrix (MOHR et al., 2005; MOHR 

et al., 2006). The remaining cement anhydrous phase, such as alite (C3S), belite (C2S) and 

tricalcium aluminate (C3A) are also detected peaks from an XRD pattern at Figure 43. 

DTA curves of C-S-H preparations show endotherms at 100°-200°C and exotherms at 835°-

900°C. CH begins to decompose at an easily detectable rate at about 370°C; under typical 

conditions for TG, decomposition is 98% complete at the end of the step at 580°C (TAYLOR, 

1990). Figure 42 shows the TG curve range of CH decomposition, it could be observed the 

slopes of mass loss in times of 0 h, until 7 h. DTA curves (Figure 40) and TG curves (Figure 

41) show what is evidence in the literature, that CO2 simultaneously reacts with C–S–H and 

CH and that the decalcification of C–S–H takes place prior to the formation of silica gel, the 

latter starting at later stages of carbonation (GROVES et al., 1991). Based on the evolution of 

10 h carbonation process in a fiber-cement composite that uses silica as a mineral addition, it is 

possible to split in two groups from P-AC-24-0h to P-AC-24-5h and P-AC-24-6h to P-AC-24-

10h. The first group presents the rapid rate of calcium hydroxide carbonation process and the 

second group shows the slow rate of carbonation process due to the mass of loss percent 

observed for this phase. CH carbonation may be initially more rapid than that of the C–S–H 

gel, but this situation soon reverses because of the formation of a layer of CaCO3 micro crystals 

at the surface of CH (GROVES et al., 1991; THIERY et al, 2007). 

On both groups, the rate of calcium carbonate formation is constantly growing. The dissociation 



 

 

 

120 

 

pressure of calcite reaches at 894°C and the decarbonation reaction is highly endothermic. The 

rate of decarbonation becomes significant at 500-600°C if a sufficiently low partial pressure of 

CO2 is maintained or if the calcite is intimately mixed with materials, such as quartz at 560°C 

(TAYLOR, 1990). The C–S–H is progressively decalcified, being converted to CaCO3 and 

silicate hydrates. The porosity of fibre–cement composites is typically high enough to permit 

constant CO2 diffusion, which results in the Ca(OH)2 to be further reduced and the calcium ions 

released from C–S–H react with carbon dioxide (FERNANDEZ-BERTOS et al., 2004).

According with Taylor (1990), TG has often been used to determine CO2, but is not suitable 

because the loss at 700-900°C is not only due to CO2. The presence of calcite peaks is a proof 

that CO2 is existing. Also, the CaCO3 could occur in other forms (e.g. as vaterite and aragonite) 

(YLMÉN et al., 2009), but in this 10 h analysis of accelerated carbonated process, the XRD 

pattern (Figure 43) indicates that there is an absence of this last phases mentioned, and calcite 

is the only form of calcium carbonate identified.    

The estimated amount of mass loss of calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)2 and calcium carbonate 

(CaCO3) is calculated following the procedure proposed by Borges et al. (2010) using the 

equations (14) and (15). This procedure considers increased molecular mass resulting from the 

carbonation process, as shown in Table 23 and would suggest an increase to the percentage of 

mass lost, confirmed in the thermogravimetric data (DTG) presented in Figure 40 

Dehydroxylation, L1, occurs between 450 and 500°C, the mass loss in this range decreases as 

the carbonation exposure time increases, and decarbonation losses, L2, occurs between 600–

750°C. The initial amount of Ca(OH)2 may be directly calculated from Eq. (16). The 

corresponding amount of CaCO3 resulting from the total Ca(OH)2 that carbonated was

On Table 23, after elaborating the estimative amount of the main phases as calcium hydroxide, 

the C-S-H gel and the calcium carbonated, the two groups mentioned previously prevalent, but 

with a difference, the first group (from P-AC-24-0h to P-AC-24-5h) presents the fast decrease 

of amount of CH and absence of C-S-H carbonation process. The second group (P-AC-24-6h 

to P-AC-24-10h) shows the slow rate of calcium hydroxide carbonation process and the 

occurrence of C-S-H carbonation process. The primary and secondary accelerate carbonation 

occurs in a couple of hours which still consider that occurs as simultaneously reaction.

Between 7 h and 10 h of carbonation process, the Table 23 presents a little increase of the 

amount of CH and a decrease of the amount of the CaCO3,. This could be attributed to the 

interchange of Ca2+ ions in the carbonation process, that after 7 h it is considered that occurs 

complete in the CH carbonation process, so from this point the primary carbonation process 

enter in a cycle don’t allowed to reduce more the portlandite, nor did influence the increase of 



 

 

 

124 

 

the calcium carbonate. At 10 h of carbonation process the increase of the amount of calcium 

carbonate it is only attributed to the secondary carbonation process.  

4.4.2. FTIR spectrometer analysis 

In all of the samples, except for the P-AC-24-0 h, the carbonate is easily seen with DR-FTIR 

spectroscopy within 5 h, 7 h and 10 h of exposure to CO2 atmospheres. 

In a moist atmosphere the CO2 reacts with calcium extracted from both the clinker and the 

calcium silica gel. Figure 44 shows the peaks at 879, 1088, 1425, 1804 and 2511 cm-1 can be 

observed in all of the spectra and were assigned to CaCO3 for the condition P-AC-24-5 h, P-

AC-24-7 h and P-AC-24-10 h. The formation of calcium carbonate is evident since 5 h of 

carbonation process with a maximum peak at 10 h carbonated condition.   It is interesting to 

note that for the 10-h hydration sample there is also a dip at 3000 cm-1  and ~950-1,100 cm-1 

corresponding to the peaks for C-S-H (YLMÉN et al.,2009). The band at ~1,650 cm-1, together 

with the increased intensity in the OH-stretching region, indicates absorption of water for all 

hydration times.  

The formation of CaCO3 in cement is a complex process that can contain reactions at various 

particle surfaces. In the early stages the carbonates formed could be considered amorphous, 

since the crystallites have not yet developed a well-defined structure. The broadening of the 

band observed at 1,088 cm-1 indicates a less ordered structure because the peak is expected to 

be narrow if the phases are crystalline (YLMÉN et al., 2013). 

At early edges the formation of CaCO3 is consistent with the infrared spectra of synthesized 

amorphous calcium carbonate (LAM et al., 2007; ANDERSEN AND LJERKA BRE?EVI?, 

1991). At later stages a more crystalline product can be expected. Consequently, the 

characteristic vibration peaks in the region 1,300–1,700 cm-1 are characteristic of all carbonate 

species irrespective of the chemical and physical form (YLMÉN et al., 2013).  

In a CO2 rich atmosphere there is a noticeable presence of Ca(OH)2, seen as a peak at              

3,643 cm-1 in the condition P-AC-24-0 h. Also, asymmetric stretching of ??4
2 at 910 cm-1 

(MYNENI et al., 1998) was observed only in uncarbonated matrix, different of symmetric 

stretching at 1000 cm-1 occurring in P-AC-24-0 h. It indicates the decrease of ??4
2 free ions 

when carbonation process occurs.

4.4.3. Microstructure of the composites SEM 

Micrographs presents were obtained by a SEM in Back-Scattered Electron Image (BSEI) mode 

for the observation of the morphological features of cut and polished surfaces of composites 

subjected to a very early age carbonated composites, the condition P-AC-24-0 h, P-AC-24-5 h, 

P-AC-24-7 h and P-AC-24-10 h. The images have a magnification of 300 x and accelerating 

voltage of 15 kV. The SEM micrographs shown are typical images of the microstructure chosen 

from around six representative images for each composite treatment. 

Figure 45 a depicts arrow 1 the initial porosity is observed in the matrix, which is influenced 

by the application of the slurry-dewatering and manual pressing in the composite at the 

fabrication process and the significant volume of fibers; that eases the penetration of CO2 for 

enhanced the composite (TONOLI et al., 2010). The cement matrix (including around the 

fibers) become denser and compact along the 10 h of carbonation process (Fig. 45b, c, d).  

The uncarbonated composite presents swelling in the fibers, due the water absorption, 

accompanied by volume expansion, from 24 h of initial hydration process of the matrix (arrow 

2 in Figure 45a). After 5 h of carbonation process the cellulose fiber shrinkage, arrow 3 (Figure 

45b,c,d) shows the interface fiber-matrix, it is notable how the accelerated carbonation process 



 

 

 

126 

 

improves the contact between cellulosic fibers and cement matrix, and possibly favoring the 

better adhesion between them (PIZZOL et al., 2014). However, arrow 4 (Figure 45 c,d) depicts 

cracks in the matrix that are observed in two of the carbonated conditions (P-AC-24-7h and P-

AC-24-10h) and surrounding of some of the cellulose pulp. These cracks are indicative of a 

weak contact between cellulose fibers and matrix, the deficient fiber-matrix interface is linked 

to behavior of mechanical properties (SAVASTANO et al., 2003; SAVASTANO et al., 2005). 

These cracks could appear due the fiber swelling and shrinkage along the matrix hydration 

process. Another problem that appears in the samples under carbonated conditions (P-AC-24-

7h and P-AC-24-10h) is indicated with Arrow 5; the early carbonation did not prevent the re-

precipitation of hydration products inside the cellulose fibers as different alkaline solid phases 

into the fiber. This re-precipitation of solids into the fiber voids (both fiber cell wall and fiber 

lumen) induces the embrittlement of the cellulose fibers by the attack of released alkaline’s ions 

(SANTOS et al., 2015; TONOLI et al., 2016).

5. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS  

5.1. Stage 2: Definition of optional parameters for supercritical carbonation process of 

vegetable Fiber-cement composites at a very early age 

The main contributions for define parameters for supercritical carbonation process at very early 

age of vegetable Fiber-Cement Composites are: 

• The results indicate that the bleached pulp reinforcement carbonated composites show 

average higher values of MOR, LOP, MOE, and SE that were 24%, 24%, 27% and 25%, 

relating the unbleached pulp reinforcement carbonated composites. This difference was 

attributed to the degree of crystallinity, the lignin content and hydrophobic of the vegetal 

fiber that could influence the improvement of the mechanical behavior of a cementitious 

composite subjected to carbonation. The SEM images showed that bleached cellulose pulp 

had better fibers-matrix adhesion than the unbleached cellulose pulp. 

• The carbonation time of 2 h or 1 h resulted in no statistically significant effect on the 

specimen’s bulk density, modulus of rupture, modulus of elasticity or specific energy. It 

would appear that for guaranteed improvements to the mechanical properties of 

composites, the accelerated supercritical carbonation process only requires 1 h.  

• Thermal hydration duration of 24 h or 48 h resulted in no statistically significant effect on 

the physical and mechanical properties (bulk density, water adsorption, modulus of rupture, 

modulus of elasticity and specific energy) of the vegetable fiber-cement composites. 

During the thermal curing of samples, hydration occurs at a rapid rate; for both cases 

hydration results were similar, highlighted by the TG/DTA results which revealed similar 

percentages of calcium hydroxide and calcium carbonate for specimens with 24 h or 48 h 

of thermal curing.  

• The results confirm what previous studies have concluded regarding the effectiveness of 

the carbonation curing process in decreasing the alkalinity and mitigating the degradation 

of cellulose fibers of natural fiber reinforced cement composites.

5.2. Stage 3: Comparative study between two kinds of mineral addition in cellulose pulp 

fiber-cement composites subjected to accelerated carbonation at very early age. 

The main contributions for a comparative study between two kinds of mineral addition in 

cellulose pulp fiber-cement composites subjected to accelerated carbonation at very early age 

are: 

• The effect of the mineral addition resulted in statistical significant effect on the mechanical 

properties (modulus of rupture, limit of proportionality and modulus of elasticity) of the 

unbleached Pinus vegetable fibre -cement composites with 24 h of initial curing and subject 

to carbonation process. The composite with addition of ground silica resulted in flexural 

test average statistically significant higher values of Limit of proportionality around 46% 

comparing with the limestone composite. This could be attribute to the interface interaction 

between the matrix and the mineral addition. On the other hand, the effect of the mineral 

addition resulted in no statistical significant effect on the physical properties (water 

absorption and bulk density). Which means both carbonated cementitious matrices, have 

the same densification and compaction  

• The initial hydration duration of 10 h or 24 h resulted in no statistically significant effect on 

the physical and mechanical properties (bulk density, water adsorption, modulus of rupture, 

modulus of elasticity and specific energy under flexure) of the vegetable fiber-cement 

composites. 

• The composite with silica addition consumes higher amount of calcium hydroxide (CH) in 

comparison with the composite with limestone addition, based on the CH residue detected 

in the XRD analysis: 3.5% and 11.5% respectively. This could be due the XRD patterns of 

quantification  of the phases of each mineral addition and owing silica chemically stable at 

low temperatures.  

 

5.3. Stage 4: Durability and hydration kinetics study in carbonated fiber-cement 

composites using silica as a mineral addition. 

The main contributions of the of durability and hydration kinetics study in carbonated fiber-

cement composites using silica as a mineral addition are: 

•    The use of silica as a mineral addition in cementitious composites subject to uncarbonated 

and very early age carbonated curing process both after 200 accelerated aging cycles presents 



 

 

 

129 

 

no reduction of mechanical performance in MOR, LOP and MOE, except the SE. This 

suggested that the use of silica in conjunction with unbleached pine fiber is an appropriate 

strategy to mitigate degradation of the composite, even if it is not present in an autoclaved 

condition. The SEM images show on both composites a good interfacial fiber-matrix bonding 

strength. Also, the XRD results, on both uncarbonated and carbonated composites, does not 

show the presence of ettringite formation which favorites decrease the degradation of pulp fiber 

into cement matrix. However, further studies for do not have a reduction in SE on the 

composites after accelerated aging cycles, still needed.   

•    The initial hydration duration of 10 h or 24 h resulted in no statistically significant effect on 

the physical and mechanical properties (bulk density, water adsorption, modulus of rupture, 

modulus of elasticity and specific energy under flexure) of the vegetable fiber-cement 

composites. During the curing of samples, hydration occurs at a normal rate; for both cases 

hydration results were similar, highlighted by the TG/DTG results which revealed similar 

percentages of calcium hydroxide and calcium carbonate for specimens with 10 h or 24 h of 

curing.  

•    In the TGA, for the peak at 800°C related to decarbonation of CaCO3, uncarbonated 

composites before ageing and initial hydrated by 24 h presented loss of mass of about 4.15%, 

while the carbonated composites before ageing showed loss of mass around 23.6%. These 

results suggest the effectiveness of the treatment with accelerated carbonation for 10 h and the 

efficacy to measurement the increase of CaCO3 after the curing process, due to the use of silica 

as neutral mineral addition on the composite.  

•    The XRD estimative amount of calcium carbonate in the carbonated composite presents an 

increase before and after accelerated aging from 34% to 41.1%. This increase could be 

attributed to the natural carbonation at the aging chamber and the cement hydration process. 

 

5.4. Stage 5: Evolution of the hydration kinetics on unbleached cellulose pulp fiber-

cement composites subjected to accelerated carbonation at very early age 

The main contributions of the study of the evolution of the hydration kinetics on unbleached 

cellulose pulp fiber-cement composites subjected to accelerated carbonation at very early age 

are: 



 

 

 

130 

 

•    Following 10 h of carbonation process in a fiber-cement composite that uses silica as mineral 

addition, DTA results shows that after 7 h of carbonation process it is considered a complete 

reduction of the amount of calcium hydroxide. This study suggested that the carbonation time 

with atmospheric CO2 concentration (20 vol%) could be reduce from 10 h to 7 h.   

•    The carbonation kinetic hydration at very early edge on unbleached pines cellulose pulp 

fiber-cement composites using silica as mineral addition, identified the main phases in the X-

ray diffraction patterns of the carbonated cementitious composites are: calcite (CaCO3); 

portlandite (P); tricalcium aluminate (C3A); belite (C2S) and alite (C3S). 

•    SEM shows how the accelerated carbonation process improves the contact between 

cellulosic fibers and cement matrix, and possibly favoring the better adhesion between them. 

However, along of carbonation process, some issues could be affected the effectiveness of the 

treatment on cellulose pulp fiber-cement composite, which is the apparition of cracks in the 

matrix and surrounding the fibers. These problems could be related to the parameters chosen 

for accelerated carbonation curing process that could be affecting the kinetic hydration of the 

matrix or due to the selection of the fiber.

6. CONCLUSIONS  

• The use of unbleached or bleached cellulosic pulp for cementitious composites resulted 

in statistically significant effects on the mechanical properties of samples, including 

modulus of rupture, modulus of elasticity and specific energy. There is not statistically 

significant difference between 24 h and 48 h of initial thermal hydration, nor did between 

2 h and 1 h of exposure time of CO2 at the chamber for supercritical carbonation. The 

supercritical treatment research suggests that the optimal parameters for production of 

vegetable fiber-cement composites include the use of bleached cellulosic pulp, 24 h of 

thermal initial hydration and 1 h of supercritical carbonation. However, the implications 

for fiber-cement industry are a challenge upon, the CO2 autoclave process could be done 

at laboratory scale but for applicate at real scale still needs to create an adequate 

infrastructure and establish the most proper process for being an applicate technology. 

• The use of limestone or silica as a mineral addition for carbonated cementitious 

composites resulted in statistically significant effects on the mechanical properties of 

samples, including modulus of rupture, modulus of elasticity and limit of proportionality. 

There is not statistically significant difference between 10 h and 24 h of initial hydration. 

This stage suggests that the better parameters for production of carbonated vegetable 

fiber-cement composites include the use of ground silica as mineral addition, 24 h of 

sealed initial hydration and 10 h of accelerated carbonation in the environmental climate 

chamber at temperature of 45°C and relative humidity (RH) of 90%. The CO2 content in 

the environmental climate chamber was monitored to 20 vol%. 

• The use of silica as a mineral addition for carbonated cementitious composites after 

Accelerated Aging Cycles resulted in no statistically significant effects on the mechanical 

properties of samples, including modulus of rupture, modulus of elasticity and limit of 

proportionality. There is not statistically significant difference between 10 h and 24 h of 

initial hydration. This stage suggests that the better parameters for production of 

carbonated vegetable fiber-cement composites include the use of ground silica as mineral 

addition, 10 h of sealed initial hydration and 10 h of accelerated carbonation in the climate 

chamber at temperature of 45°C and relative humidity (RH) of 90%. The CO2 content in 

the climate chamber was monitored to 20 vol%. 

• The use of silica as a mineral addition for carbonated cementitious composites, allow to 

study at early edge the evolution of the hydration kinetics. This stage suggests that the 



 

 

 

132 

 

better parameters for production of vegetable fiber-cement composites include the use of 

ground silica as mineral addition, 10 h of sealed initial hydration and 7 h of accelerated 

carbonation in the climate chamber at a temperature of 45°C and relative humidity (RH) 

of 90%. The CO2 content in the climate chamber was monitored to 20 vol%.  



 

 

 

133 

 

7. SUGESTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH  

 

• Study of the influence of low concentrations (e.g. 5%, 10%) of CO2, on fiber-cement 

cementitious composites subject to accelerated carbonation process that use silica as 

mineral addition. This research is suggested due the current  

 

• Study of the amorphous amount of calcium carbonated and calcium hydroxide through 

Synchrotron Light Source (LNLS) Rietveld analysis, in fiber-cement cementitious 

composites subject to accelerated carbonation process.
