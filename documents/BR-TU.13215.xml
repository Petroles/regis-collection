ABSTRACT

We compared the values of the biomass, chemical composition and nutritive value of the emergent aquatic 
macrophyte S. alterniflora in a river affected by the discharge of domestic sewage (guaú river) and in 
an unpolluted river (itanhaém river). S. alterniflora, water and sediment samples were obtained in the 
two rivers in november, 2001. the guaú river presented the highest levels of total-n and total-p in the 
water (415 and 674 ?g.l-1, respectively) and in the sediment (0.25 e 0.20% of the dry mass, respectively), 
when compared to the water (tn = 105 ?g.l-1; tp = 20 ?g.l-1) and the sediment (nt = 0.12% dm; 
pt = 0.05% dm) of the itanhaém river. aerial (316 g dm.m-2) and subterraneous (425 g dm.m-2) 
biomass of S. alterniflora were significantly higher in the guaú river than in the itanhaém river (146 and 
115 g dm.m-2, respectively). in addition, the values of tn, protein, tp, lipids and soluble carbohydrates 
were significantly higher in S. alterniflora biomass from the guaú river. on the other hand, the values 
of the polyphenols and the cell wall fraction were significantly higher in the biomass of S. alterniflora 
from the itanhaém river. We concluded that domestic sewage discharge in water bodies may increase 
the biomass and change the chemical composition of S. alterniflora. the high n and p availability in the 
water of the guaú river is probably the cause of the higher biomass, tn, tp, protein, lipids and soluble 
carbohydrates measured in S. alterniflora in this river.

Keywords: biomass, chemical composition, nutritive value, Spartina alterniflora.

RESUMO

Mudanças na biomassa, composição química e valor nutritivo de Spartina alterniflora devido à 
poluição orgânica na Bacia do Rio Itanhaém (SP, Brasil)

 foram comparados a biomassa, a composição química e o valor nutritivo da macrófita aquática emersa 
S. alterniflora em um rio impactado por descargas de efluentes domésticos (rio guaú) e em um rio bem 
conservado (rio itanhaém). amostras de S. alterniflora, água e sedimento foram coletadas nos dois rios, 
em novembro de 2001. o rio guaú apresentou as maiores concentrações de n-total e p-total na água 
(415 e 674 ?g.l-1, respectivamente) e sedimento (0,25 e 0,20% de massa seca, respectivamente), em 
relação a água (nt = 105 ?g.l-1; pt= 20 ?g.l-1) e sedimento (nt = 0,12% ms; pt = 0,05% ms) do rio 
itanhaém. a biomassa aérea (316 g ms.m-2) e subterrânea (425 g ms.m-2) de S. alterniflora no rio guaú 
foram significativamente maiores do que no rio itanhaém (146 e 115 g ms.m-2). além disto, os valores 
de nt, proteínas, pt, lipídios e carboidratos solúveis foram significativamente maiores na biomassa de 
S. alterniflora no rio guaú. por outro lado, a fração de parede celular e os teores de polifenóis foram maiores 
na biomassa de S. alterniflora no rio itanhaém. Concluiu-se que o lançamento de efluentes domésticos

em corpos d’água pode aumentar a biomassa e alterar a composição química de S. alterniflora. a maior 
disponibilidade de n e p no rio guaú, provavelmente, é a causa dos maiores valores de biomassa, nt, pt, 
lipídeos e carboidratos solúveis em S. alterniflora neste rio.

INDRODUCTION

domestic sewage discharges in water courses 
increase the concentrations of organic matter and 
nutrients that can affect the productivity of the 
system, increase particulate materials and reduce 
the amount of dissolved oxygen (laws &amp;amp; allen, 
1996; hall et al., 1999). as a consequence, aquatic 
organism populations may change in quantity and 
quality (ricklefs &amp;amp; miller, 1999). according to 
laws (1999), domestic sewage discharges affect the 
aquatic macrophyte communities in terms of growth 
and species occurrence and can promote species 
substitutions. eutrophication, in general, causes 
the reduction or elimination of submerged aquatic 
macrophytes due to reduced light penetration caused 
by increased quantities of suspended matter in the 
water (madsen &amp;amp; adams, 1988). on the other hand, 
floating species are favoured by nutrient increases 
in water (bini et al., 1999). emergent macrophytes, 
which are not in direct competition for nutrients or 
light with either algae or submerged plants, may 
show enhanced growth and biomass over a wide 
range of nutrient inputs (harper, 1995).

nutrient increases in water and sediment, as 
a consequence of eutrophication, can change the 
chemical composition of aquatic plants as there is a 
close relationship between the nutrient availability 
in the ecosystem and in the plant tissue (tucker, 
1981; morris, 1982; esteves, 1998). in fact, nutrient 
availability can directly affect the growth rate of 
some aquatic macrophyte species (henry-silva et 
al., 2002). in addition, the chemical composition 
of the aquatic plants influences the use of biomass 
by herbivorous and detritivorous animals (barbieri 
&amp;amp; esteves, 1991).

in the estuarine region of the basin of the 
itanhaém river (são paulo south Coast), there are 
unpolluted rivers and some tidal creeks affected 
by domestic waste (Camargo et al., 2002). in 
both aquatic environments the emergent aquatic 
macrophyte Spartina alterniflora is abundant and 
occurs close to the border of mangrove vegetation 
(tonizza, 2002). the objective of the present study 

is to compare the values of biomass, chemical 
composition and nutrient value of S. alterniflora in a 
river affected by domestic sewage discharge (guaú 
river) and in a non-affected river (itanhaém river).

Study area
the guaú and itanhaém rivers are located 

in the hydrographic basin of the itanhaém river 
(fig. 1). this hydrographic basin has a total area 
of 950 km2 and is located on the south coast of são 
paulo state, south-eastern brazil (23° 50’ and 24° 
15’ s; 46° 35’ and 47° 00’ W) (suguiu &amp;amp; martin, 
1978). according to laparelli &amp;amp; moura (1998), the 
climate of the region presents little variation due 
to its latitude and proximity to the atlantic ocean. 
rain is abundant (annual mean of 2183 mm), with 
more rainfall in march (279.9 mm) and less in 
august (84.7 mm). the atmospheric temperature 
in the region is high, with a minimum mean of 
19.0 °C (July) and the maximum mean of 26.2 °C 
(february).

the guaú river is a tidal creek that crosses 
the urban zone of itanhaém municipality and 
receives domestic waste without previous treatment 
(Camargo et al., 1996). in the lower course, the 
guaú river flows through mangrove vegetation and 
some shore areas are colonized by monospecific 
stands of S. alterniflora.

the itanhaém river is the final channel of 
the hydrographic basin and is located on a coastal 
plain. this river is formed by the confluence of the 
preto and branco rivers. these two rivers drain 
well preserved areas of tropical rain forest of the 
state park of the sea range, preserved areas of 
restinga vegetation and some areas with banana 
farms (Camargo et al., 1997). the itanhaém river 
flows through mangrove vegetation with stands 
of S. alterniflora, Crinum procerum and Scirpus 
californicus on shore areas.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Water, sediment and S. alterniflora samples 
were collected in the lower course of the guaú

river and in the upper course of the itanhaém 
river in november, 2001. simultaneously, the 
ph values, salinity and turbidity were taken (in 
triplicate) using a Water Quality Checker, horiba 
(model u10). photosynthetic active radiation 
(par) was measured (in triplicate) at 0.0 m and 
0.2 m, with the light meter liCor (model 189) and 
the coefficient of the vertical attenuation (K) was 
calculated using the following equation: K = (ln.

Io – ln.I)/z, where ln is the natural logarithm, I is 
the par at a determined depth (m), Io is the par at 
the surface and z is the depth (m) (Wetzel, 1983).

Water samples (in triplicate) were collected 
near stands of S. alterniflora. afterwards, dissolved 
oxygen (dissolved o

method according to golterman et al. (1978).

obtained by the methods described in mackreth et 
al. (1978). ammoniacal nitrogen (ammoniacal-n) 
was determined using the method proposed by 
Koroleff (1976). total inorganic nitrogen (tin) 
was calculated by the sum of no

-n and 

ammoniacal-n. total phosphorus (tp), total 
dissolved phosphorus (tdp) and orthophosphates 
(po

4
-p) were measured through methods described 

in golterman et al. (1978).
sediment samples (in 5 replicates) were also 

collected near the stands of S. alterniflora to measure 
the total nitrogen (tn) using Kjeldahl`s method 
(allen et al., 1974), and the total phosphorus (tp) 
using the same methodology utilized by esteves 
(1980).

S. alterniflora samples (in 5 replicates) 
were obtained within a square of 0.25 m2. the 
plants were cleaned through successive washes 
in order to remove the periphyton, organic matter 
and associated inorganic particles. thereafter, the 
plants were separated into the aerial parts (stalk and 
leaf) and subterraneous parts (root and rhizome), 
dried at 60 °C and weighed in order to determine 
the values of aerial and subterraneous biomass in 
grams of dry mass by square meter (g dm.m-2). 
afterwards, the samples were ground in a mill to 
determine the chemical composition.

the total nitrogen (tn) was determined 
by the Kjeldahl method according to allen et al. 
(1974). total phosphorus (tp) was determined by 
the method described by esteves (1980). soluble 
carbohydrates were obtained according to esteves 
(1979). lipids were obtained by the method 
described by folch et al. (1957). the percentage of 
cell wall fraction was determined according to van 
soest &amp;amp; Wine (1967). polyphenols were measured 
by the method described in King &amp;amp; healt (1967). 
protein was calculated by multiplying the results 
of total nitrogen by 6.25 (boyd, 1970). afterwards, 
the values of chemical composition in the total 
biomass were determined using the pondered 
mean of the respective values obtained in aerial and 
subterraneous biomass. 

the t-test (student) was applied to water 
and sediment data in order to check for significant 
differences (p ? 0.05) between the itanhaém and 
guaú rivers. prior to anova (one way), we checked 
the homogeneity of variances in S. alterniflora data 
using bartllet’s test. When significant differences 
(p ? 0.05) occurred, tukey’s hsd test was used to 

identify differences in the values of biomass and 
chemical composition among total biomass, aerial 
biomass, subterraneous biomass of S. alterniflora 
in the two rivers (zar, 1996).

RESULTS

table 1 presents the mean and standard 
deviation of the physical and chemical variables 
measured in the water and sediment of the itanhaém 
and guaú rivers. the values of temperature, 
turbidity and K were significantly higher (p ? 0.05) 
in the guaú river, while dissolved o

 was 0 mg.l-1 

in this river. the salinity and ph values of the two 
rivers were not significantly different. in relation 
to nutrients, the guaú river presented the highest 
values of tn and tp in water and sediment. this 
river also presented the highest values of tdn, 
tin, tdp and po

-p.

fig. 2 shows the mean and standard deviation 
of the total, aerial and subterraneous biomass of 
S. alternilfora, in the itanhaém and guaú rivers. the 
total biomass of S. alterniflora in the guaú river 
(732 g dm.m-2) was significantly higher than in the 
itanhaém river (262 g dm.m-2). in the guaú river, 
aerial (316 g dm.m-2) and subterraneous 
(425 g dm.m-2) biomass of S. alterniflora were 
also significantly higher when compared to aerial 
(146 g dm.m-2) and subterraneous (115 g dm.m-2) 
biomass of S. alterniflora in the itanhaém river.

fig. 3 and fig. 4 present the mean and standard 
deviation of the chemical composition in total, 
aerial and subterraneous biomass of S. alterniflora 
in the itanhaém and guaú rivers.

When comparing the chemical composition 
of the total biomass of S. alterniflora in the two 
rivers, it can be observed that in the guaú river 
there are significant higher values of tn, tp, 
protein, soluble carbohydrates and lipids. in 
the itanhaém river, the values of polyphenols 
and cell wall fraction of the total biomass of 
S. alterniflora were significantly higher (fig. 4). 
the same differences were observed for aerial and 
subterraneous biomass. in fact, both plant parts in 
the guaú river showed significant higher values of 
tn, tp, protein, soluble carbohydrates and lipids. 
aerial and subterraneous biomass of S. alterniflora 
in the itanhaém river showed significantly higher 
values of polyphenols and cell wall fraction than in 
the guaú river.

in both rivers the concentrations of tn, tp, 
proteins, lipids and soluble carbohydrates were 
higher in the aerial biomass of S. alterniflora (figs. 3 
and 4), while the percentage of cell wall fraction 
was higher in the subterraneous biomass (fig. 4c).

DISCUSSION

the results of physical and chemical variables 
of water and sediment demonstrated that the 
guaú river has higher levels of organic pollution 

than the itanhaém river (table 1). other authors 
(Camargo et al., 1995; sanches &amp;amp; Camargo, 
1995; henry-silva &amp;amp; Camargo, 2000) studying 
others rivers in são paulo state submitted to urban 
wastewater discharge, also observed high nutrient 
concentrations (tn, tin, tp and po

 levels as well as water transparency.

probably, the highest concentrations of n 
and p in the water and sediment of the guaú river 
are responsible for the higher values of biomass,

tn and tp of S. alterniflora from this river. in 
fact, the environmental availability of n and p 
control the growth of freshwater plants (ricklefs 
&amp;amp; miller, 1999). therefore, the absorption of these 
two nutrients by plants, in general, is higher when 
the environmental availability of n and p is higher 
(larcher, 2000). on the other hand, anoxia and 
low transparency probably did not limit the growth 
of S. alterniflora in the guaú river as emergent 
aquatic macrophytes make gaseous changes and 
use direct light from the atmosphere (esteves, 
1998; Camargo et al., 2003). morris (1982) in 
a laboratory experiment also observed higher 
biomass of S. alterniflora in higher concentrations 
of nitrogen. in addition, pierce (1983) measuring 
biomass of Spartina maritima in algoa bay (south 
africa) obtained higher values for the areas with 
higher concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorous 
(table 2).

the highest concentrations of protein, soluble 
carbohydrates and lipids in the total biomass of 

S. alterniflora in the guaú river are probably 
related to the higher availability of nitrogen and 
phosphorus in this river. these nutrients contribute 
to the biosynthesis of protein, soluble carbohydrates 
and lipids and are part of enzymes and cofactors 
(atp, nadp) involved in these process (salisbury 
&amp;amp; ross, 1992). barbieri &amp;amp; esteves (1991) also 
observed a positive relationship between n and 
p availability in the water column and the protein 
concentration, soluble carbohydrates and lipids 
in the freshwater aquatic macrophytes Pontederia 
cordata and Utricularia breviscapa.

the differences in the chemical composition 
between aerial and subterraneous biomass of 
S. alterniflora are probably related to the different 
functions of the plant structures. according to 
esteves (1998), in general, the plant part with a high 
metabolic rate has a high concentration of nutrients 
and according to barbieri &amp;amp; esteves (1991) it 
also has higher values of soluble carbohydrates, 
lipids and polyphenols. therefore, the higher

Fig. 4 — means and standard deviations of soluble carbohydrates (a), lipids (b), cell wall fraction (c) and polyphenols (d) in 
total, aerial and subterraneous (subter.) biomass of S. alterniflora. different letters indicate significant differences (p ? 0.05).

values of tn, tp, soluble carbohydrates, lipids and 
polyphenols in aerial biomass of S. alterniflora 
are probably due to the high enzymatic activity of 
photosynthetic structures.

a whole analysis of the chemical composition 
of aquatic macrophytes provides information 

about the nutritive value of the biomass (barbieri 
&amp;amp; esteves, 1991). in fact, proteins, lipids and 
carbohydrates are essential in animal feeding as 
they are structural components and an energy 
source (randall et al., 1997). according to some 
studies (onuf et al., 1977; Kraft &amp;amp; denno, 1982; 



788 biudes, J. f. v. and Camargo, a. f. m.

Braz. J. Biol., 66(3): 781-789, 2006

Coley, 1983), leaf protein content has been shown 
to play a central role in determining herbivore 
feeding patterns in several aquatic and terrestrial 
communities. on the other hand, high concentrations 
of polyphenols (antocians, tanins, flavonols, metil-
propans and fenil-propans) and high percentages of 
cell wall fraction (cellulose, lignin and nitrogeneted 
lignificat substances of hard digestion) decrease 
the consumption of biomass by aquatic animals 
(barbieri &amp;amp; esteves, 1991; henry-silva et al., 
2001). therefore, S. alterniflora from the guaú 
river has a better nutritive value due to the higher 
values of protein, lipids, carbohydrates and lower 
values of polyphenols and cell wall fraction in the 
biomass. these results suggest that S. alterniflora 
is a food source more available for the herbivores 
food chain in the guaú river because generalists’ 
herbivores will first consume food with a high 
nutritive value (begon et al., 1996). furthermore, 
the higher values of S. alterniflora biomass in the 
guaú river will probably increase its availability 
as a food source even more.

We conclude that the discharge of domestic 
sewage in water bodies may increase the biomass and 
change the chemical composition of S. alterniflora. 
among the limnological characteristics changed 
by the discharge of domestic sewage, the higher 
n and p availability, is probably the cause of the 
higher biomass, tn, tp, protein, lipids and soluble 
carbohydrates in S. alterniflora from the guaú 
river.
