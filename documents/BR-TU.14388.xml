ABSTRACT
Two hundred and twenty three subjects from a Schistosoma mansoni low morbidity endemic area and nine hospitalized
hepatosplenic patients were submitted to stool test and clinical examination and abdomen ultrasound assessments.
According to stool examination and ultrasound results, they were grouped as follows: G1 - 63 Schistosoma mansoni
egg-negative individuals; G2 - 141 egg-positive patients and without evidence of periportal fibrosis; G3 - 19 egg-positive
patients with periportal echogenicity (3-6mm); and G4 - 9 hepatosplenic patients with periportal echogenicity (&gt; 6mm).
Hepatomegaly detected by physical examination of the abdomen evaluated in the midclavicular line was verified in G1,
G2 and G3, respectively, in 11.1, 12.1 and 26.3%. In G1, G2 and G3, periportal thickening occurred only in schistosomal
patients (8.5%). Mild pathological alterations in patients that cannot yet be detected by clinical examination were
detectable in the liver by ultrasound and can be due to fibrosis. The degree of mild periportal fibrosis was diminished in
57.9% of patients 12 months after treatment of schistosomiasis with oxamniquine. At ultrasonography, the mean liver
left lobe measurement of G3 was larger than that of G1, and that of G4 larger than that of G1 and G2. The mean size of
the spleen of G4 was significantly larger than that of the other three groups, and that of G3 larger than that of G1 and G2.

RESUMO
Duzentos e vinte e três indivíduos de área endêmica de baixa morbidade para esquistossomose e nove pacientes hospitalizados
com a forma hepatoesplênica foram submetidos ao exame de fezes e clínico e à ultra-sonografia do abdômen. De acordo
com os resultado dos exames de fezes e do ultra-som eles foram agrupados do seguinte modo: G1 - 63 indivíduos sem ovos
de Schistosoma mansoni nas fezes; G2 - 141 indivíduos apresentando ovos de Schistosoma mansoni nas fezes, sem
ecogenicidade periportal. G3 – 19 indivíduos com ovos de Schistosoma mansoni nas fezes e ecogenicidade periportal
entre 3-6mm.; G4 – 9 pacientes hepatesplênicos com ecogenicidade periportal &gt; 6mm. Pelo exame físico do abdômen, a
hepatomegalia na linha hemiclavicular direita foi constatada em G1, G2 E G3, respectivamente, em 11,1, 12,1 e 26,3%. Nos
grupos G1, G2 e G3, houve espessamento periportal somente em esquistossomáticos (8,5%). Alterações patológicas leves
em pacientes, as quais não puderam ser detectadas pelo exame clínico, foram evidenciadas no fígado pelo ultra-som e
podem ser devidas à fibrose. O grau de fibrose periportal leve foi diminuído em 57,9% dos pacientes 12 meses após tratamento
da esquistossomose com oxamniquine. Na ultra-sonografia, a média da medida do lobo esquerdo do fígado dos indivíduos
de G3 foi maior que a de G1 e, a de G4 maior que a de G1 e G2. O tamanho médio do baço de G4 foi significativamente
maior que o dos outros grupos e o de G3 foi maior que o de G1 e G2.

Magalhães TVB et al

Schistosoma mansoni has a wide geographical distribution
in Africa, South America and the Caribbean. The disease is mainly
due to eggs deposited in the host tissue by the adult female whose
antigens induce granuloma formation and fibrosis, essentially in
intestine and liver portal system. Most of the infected individuals
living in endemic areas are asymptomatic but a few develop
Symmers’ periportal fibrosis of the liver, that results in the severe
form of the disease with subsequent portal hypertension,
splenomegaly, esophageal varices and recurrent hematemesis. The
hepatointestinal and compensated hepatosplenic clinical forms
represent early forms of the severe clinical disease found in the
hospital (decompensated hepatosplenic)5. The sequential
development of hepatosplenic disease was well demonstrated and
anatomicopathologically proven15. These conclusions were
obtained from clinical diagnosis based on liver left lobe
enlargement, consistency, as well as spleen size detected by physical
examination15. However, when ultrasound was used for abdominal
evaluation in field surveys in endemic areas for schistosomiasis, it
became clear that the physical examination of the patients did not
always reflect the stage of the disease1. This conclusion is based
on the thickness of periportal fibrosis as determined by ultrasound
echogenicity which correlates with liver biopsies in pathological
studies9. However, there is a variation on the assessment of images
provided by ultrasound8, especially in mild pathology, frequently
seen in field surveys. In these cases, the interpretation of ultrasound
images has been discussed.

In order to identify the meaning of some findings, we
compared several clinical and ultrasound parameters of distinct
groups of schistosomiasis patients with an egg-negative group
from the same endemic area. These groups were also compared
with hospitalized patients with the severe hepatosplenic form of
the disease.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Studied population. This study was performed in two
localities endemic for schistosomiasis (Dionísio and Melquiades)
in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. A schistosomiasis program
aimed at studying several aspects of the disease has been active
in these two localities since 1995. The volunteers (n = 223)
were submitted to parasitological, clinical and ultrasound
examinations. Nine patients with a clinical diagnosis of
hepatosplenic schistosomiasis from the Santa Casa Hospital of
Belo Horizonte city (Brazil) were also included in this study.

It is important to mention that malaria is not endemic in
these areas; therefore it is not a confounding disease.
Protocols involving human subjects were approved by the
institutional review and ethical committee of the Fundação
Oswaldo Cruz (FIOCRUZ). Treatment was offered to all
individuals independent of whether they consented to
participate in the study.

Parasitological examination. Schistosoma mansoni
infection was evaluated by individual fecal egg examinations
determined by the Kato-Katz method on stool samples
obtained on three consecutive days11.

Clinical examination. Clinical examination of 223 subjects
was performed by two physicians. One examined patients from
Dionisio and, the other those from Melquiades. Both physicians were
blind to the results of the feces and ultrasonographic examinations.
Hepatosplenic patients were examined by other physicians.

At abdominal examination, palpation of the right lobe of the
liver was evaluated in the midclavicular line and the left lobe in
the epigastrium at inspiration; the enlargement, consistency and
surface were recorded. The spleen was examined below left costal
margin at inspiration.

Based on clinical criteria, the patients were considered as
intestinal (liver&amp;lt;2 cm under the costal edge), hepatointestinal
(liver palpable &gt;2 cm under the costal edge) and hepatosplenic.

Patients with schistosomiasis were treated with oral
oxamniquine, in a single dose of 15mg/kg.

Ultrasound. A conventional portable Hitachi EUB-200
ultrasound equipment (Tokyo, Japan) was used in the field study
and a Sonoline Versa Plus, Siemens ultrasound with a transducer
of 3.5 MHz for hospitalized patients. Liver size, portal-vein
diameter, thickness of the walls of central and peripheral portal
branches, spleen size and splenic vein diameters were assessed
as described elsewhere1 9. Liver span was measured both in the
midclavicular line and the midline. The liver was also examined
for surface smoothness. Portal vein diameter was measured at
its entrance into the liver and its bifurcation inside the liver. The
spleen was evaluated by using oblique and longitudinal scanning
of the left upper quadrant. The gallbladder was examined for
wall thickness and stones. The periportal thickness was evaluated
according to established criteria1 4 9, with few modifications. The
two physicians performing ultrasound examinations were neither
aware of the infection status nor clinical examinations of the
patients undergoing ultrasonography. The echo enhancer contrast
(Levovistâ ) was used as described by Albrecht et al2.

One year after treatment, some patients were again
submitted to ultrasound evaluation.

Classification of studied population. According to
the result of stool test for Schistosoma mansoni eggs and
the presence of periportal fibrosis, the individuals in the
endemic areas were classified into three groups.

Group 1 - Control subjects - S. mansoni egg-negative individuals
at stool test. Group 2 - Patients eliminating S. mansoni eggs in the
feces and without periportal thickening. Group 3 - Schistosoma
mansoni egg-positive patients at stool test and periportal thickening
at ultrasound examination. A Group 4 was added to these three
groups, composed of patients from Santa Casa Hospital of Belo
Horizonte diagnosed with schistosomiasis hepatosplenic form.

Statistical methods . The data were analyzed by least square
analysis of variance using general linear models procedures.
Tukey’s test was used to determine if significant statistical differences
(p&amp;lt;0.05) existed between groups in relation to hepatic left lobe,
spleen size, portal and splenic vein diameters and central and
peripheral echogenicity, after data transformation. Since it was
not possible to use analysis of variance in the analysis of age and
spleen vein diameter, Kruskall-Wallis and Mann-Whitney non-
parametric tests, were used for group comparisons. To evaluate

the relationships among several parameters the Spearman
correlation coefficient was used. Variables before and after
treatment were examined by Student’s t-test. All the analyses were
performed by using the SPSS software, release 8.0.

RESULTS

Characterization of the study sample based on clinical
examination and echogenicity. Group 1-Consisted of 63
individuals without S. mansoni eggs in the feces and without
thickening of the portal vein wall (periportal fibrosis). At clinical
examination, the liver was palpable in 7 (11.1%) 2-7 cm under
right costal edge at midclavicular line level. Group 2 - With 141 egg-
positive patients without periportal fibrosis. In this Group there were
17 (12.1 %) patients with right liver lobe palpable 2-9cm under
right costal edge. Group 3 - With 19 egg-positive patients with
periportal fibrosis. The periportal thickening varied from 3 to 6mm,
this being central in 15 and peripheral in 14. In only 5 (26.3 %)
patients of this Group, the liver was palpable at right midclavicular
line. Group 4 - Composed of 9 patients. From these, 4 had digestive
hemorrhages and were hospitalized and 5 were cared for at the out-
patient clinic. The liver was palpated in 7 (77.8%) of them and the
spleen in 8 (88.8%). The central periportal thickening varied from
7 to 13mm and the peripheral one from 3.5 to 5mm.

With regard to the spleen, it was not palpated in any patient
of Groups 1, 2 or 3 and in only one of Group 4. As to the clinical
forms, in Group 2 there were 124 intestinal and 17
hepatointestinal, and in Group 3, respectively 14 and 5; there
were no patients with the hepatosplenic form nor with hard or
nodular liver in Groups 2 and 3. In Group 4, all patients were
hepatosplenic.

In short, comparing the palpation of liver at right
midclavicular line, 2cm or more under costal edge, with the
presence of periportal fibrosis (central and/or peripheral), it
was verified that hepatomegaly without periportal fibrosis
occurred in 24 individuals (G1 and G2) and hepatomegaly in
5/19 with periportal fibrosis.

The age of the individuals varied from 8 to 77 years and the
distribution according to age and sex in each group is presented in
Table 1. Group 2 has the lowest mean age, but differed statistically
only from Group 1. In relation to sex, the total sample is balanced
with 54% male and 46% female. However, a statistical difference
was observed in Group 3 of which 89.5% were male.

Ultrasound measurements of organ size, and vein
diameter. The mean values for longitudinal and antero-
posterior measurements of liver left lobe and spleen as well
as the diameters of portal and splenic veins are presented in

Table 2. The statistical differences among Groups 1, 2, 3 and
4 are shown in Figure 1. In the statistical analysis, the effect
of sex and age were controlled by including these variables
in the statistical model. The mean left lobe longitudinal
measurement of G3 differed statistically only from Group 1
(control) and the mean antero-posterior measurement of G4
differed from G1 and G2. The mean enlargement of the spleen
seems to be a better parameter than that of the liver to assess
morbidity by physical examination. This is demonstrated by
both measurements of the spleen, longitudinal and antero-
posterior, of patients in G4 who differed from the other three
groups. In addition, the mean longitudinal measurement of
the spleen from G3 patients was significantly higher than those
of G1 and G2 and lower than those of G4. The mean diameter
of the portal vein of G3 was significantly larger than those of
G1 and G2, but the mean diameter of G4 did not differ from
G1 and G2. The mean diameter of the splenic vein of G4
differed statistically from G2, but not from the other two
groups. Parametric test showed that both groups differed
statistically (p &amp;lt;0.05) from each other.

Doppler ultrasonography using an echo enhancer agent

Ultrasound after treatment. One year after treatment,
as shown in Table 3, there was a significant decrease in the
measurements of portal and splenic vein diameters as well
as in central echogenicity. After treatment, portal vein
echogenicity was reduced in 11 (57.9%) patients, remained
unaltered in 5 (26.3%) and increased in 3 (15.8%). In 14
patients, the periportal thickening after treatment became&amp;lt;
3mm, and in five it remained between 3-6 mm.

DISCUSSION

Among the volunteers of the populations in the endemic
areas studied, in spite of the high prevalence of positive stool
tests for Schistosoma mansoni, there was no patient with
the hepatosplenic form of the disease. Thus, the areas are of
low morbidity. No patient had hard nor nodular liver nor with
prominent left lobe, which are the main clinical features for
suspicion of liver with periportal fibrosis. However, even
without clinical suspicion, periportal thickening was
evidenced in 19 (8.5%) of the schistosomal individuals
examined. It has long been known14 that Symmers’ fibrosis
could occur without splenomegaly and without portal
hypertension and that this was frequent in endemic areas13

The ultrasound examination not only allows confirmation of
the diagnosis but shows that the finding is still more frequent
than it was expected to be12. And also, as can be seen in this
work, it occurs even in some patients without clinical signs
suggestive of Symmers’ fibrosis.

Unlike that which occurred in hepatosplenic patients
(G4), the echogenicity degree found in the endemic areas
(G3) was slight. The mild periportal fibrosis and cellular
infiltration can be seen in portal spaces and although more
frequent in schistosomiasis3, it had been reported also in non
schistosomiasis patients3 16. It is necessary to keep this in mind
when the interpretation of the meaning of mild periportal
t h i c k n e s s  f o u n d  i n  m a n y  p e o p l e  i n  e n d e m i c  a r e a s  i s
considered. S. mansoni egg-negative individuals at stool test
(G1), and the disappearance of this thickening in 57.9% of
our patients after treatment (G3) suggest its connection with
schistosomiasis.

In addition, the mean longitudinal measurement of the spleen
of G3 patients was significantly higher than those of G1 and G2
and smaller than those of G4. Jesus et al10 observed in
hepatosplenic patients a correlation between the echogenicity
of the portal tract and spleen size. Our data also showed that the
portal and splenic vein diameters were slightly larger in G3 and
G4 groups but these results were not statistically significant.

Our studies are in agreement with previous studies by
Doehring-Schwerdtfeger et al8, demonstrating that treatment
induces significant decrease in morbidity, in the group of patients
where severe morbidity has not yet developed. Whether mild
periportal fibrosis is reinstalled when an individual is reinfected
is still to be evaluated. It is also important to evaluate whether in
patients with hepatosplenomegaly, the ultrasound confirms the
same decrease in morbidity evidenced by clinical examination6.

Doppler ultrasonography using the echo enhancer agent
(Levovist) showed an improvement in the visualization of the
portal hepatic veins but did not add any additional relevant
information.

In our study, the most precise data that allowed us to
determine the stage of pathological development were from
analyses of central and peripheral echogenicity of the
periportal region and spleen size.
