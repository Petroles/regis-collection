AKNOWLEDGEMENTS 

There were many people who supported me to the development of this work. First, 

I would like to thank the guidance of Professor Paulo Nuno Vicente, his trust in me, his 

enthusiasm and support which he has always expressed, during this work project. 

It was a good luck and I think it was in a good time to get to know the iNOVA Media 

Lab team. Being surrounded by motivated and committed people it's a luck and an invaluable 

opportunity. 

I thank my colleagues, Ana Sofia Paiva and Carol Delmazo, for the meetings and 

brainstorming that we have held together, since the beginning. It was very important and 

enriching to me having their motivation and friendship. 

I also want to express my thanks to all the people I met at XR Immersive Media 

meetups and during iNOVA Media Lab meetings and training, because during those events 

it was a constant discovery that furthered my own curiosity. 

To all my colleagues and professors of the MSc in Science Communication I want to 

thank, not only for the quality of teaching, but also for the sharing of experiences and critical 

opinions that have helped me to achieve this phase. 

Professor António Granado, I want to thank for your valuable contribution during 

the proof of concept of this project. 

To the direction of the Secondary School of Azambuja, Professor Madalena Tavares, 

I express my gratitude for her receptivity to my ideas and for the flexibility she has shown 

for me, that made possible to test my project. Specifically, to Professor Edmundo Martins, I 

want to thank him for his availability during the proof of concept. His willingness to see the 

project concept replicated in a more continuous way is an excellent indicator and gives me 

even more strength to move forward. 

A big thank you to all the students who participated in this work, because without 

them the project would not make any sense. Your voice is vital for everyone as we try to 

minimize the complex problems we face more and more. 

To all my colleagues at Ajuda Botanical Garden, Plantar uma Árvore Association and 

Quinta do Zé Pinto - ANPOC, I manifest my friendship. They are part of my history. 



 
 

I thank my trainers, Mónica Menezes and António Pedro Santos, and all Cenjor's 

colleagues, who during the Storytelling training listened to me many times and motivated me 

to follow in my dreams. 

To my family and friends, who directly or indirectly helped me to go ahead, to believe 

in my convictions and potentialities, I express my thanks. A big hug to Nuno Peixoto for his 

support and patience. 

I am fortunate to have my parents for their love, for their unconditional support, 

and, even in most challenging phases, they have always been present, giving me 

encouragement to never give up on my goals. I feel grateful. 

Finally, I want to dedicate this work to the persons that, besides my parents, represent 

a fundamental pillar for me, my grandparents. Grandmother Linda is still present and lately, 

we often laughed together while I explained her the concept of my project. My grandmother 

is always attentive and curious. My lovely grandfather Horta has already left, but I am sure 

he would be very happy with this my adventure. In the last years of his life I have often found 

him re-reading his books about Chemistry and Algebra, his great passions. He was brilliant 

in those areas and was the person who most encouraged me, since the childhood, to observe 

and to interpret Nature, to love Science.

 Abstract 

This study explores interactive narrative, manifested through multimodality in the 
format of the interactive documentary (i-doc), as a proposal to science communication, in a 
specific context. The oldest botanical garden in Portugal celebrates, in 2018, 250 years of 
existence and is the scenario for that proposal. This choice was preponderant because the 
subject to be communicated is in the ambit of Botany and Biodiversity Conservation and 
point out the importance of citizenship in the mobilization of efforts that can minimize the 
complex problems and challenges associated with those fields. 

 In science communication the format of the interactive documentary has been little 
explored and in this sense this work has been developed to produce an original empirical 
contribution that opens the way to new approaches in this sense. 360 video, virtual reality 
and augmented reality can be explored and remixed with traditional media trying to promote 
more engagement of people with Botany and related sciences. Transdisciplinarity is a key 
component of this project that aims to explore Design, not only in the several perspectives 
as a discipline, but also as a scientific area of extreme utility and that enables to build bridges 
between different areas.  

Articulating storytelling, gaming and multimodality, one prototype was produced and 
its respective proof of concept was carried out in two classes: Biology and Geology students 
from regular secondary school and Journalism students from university level, and the 
respective teachers were involved in the process. Action-research was applied in an original 
way that intends to add value to practical case studies, and plan targeted actions. 
Bibliographic review, questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, participation observation 
and focus group were the used techniques to test and evaluate the inherent project concept. 
The results obtained are favorable to the usefulness and viability of the idea and it will be 
interesting to investigate in a more systematic way, to better understand opportunities in the 
intersection between science, technology and art. Emotions, cognition, and human-centered 
design are very interesting fields to investigate.  

The author argues that i-doc rather than being only a media or digital media channel, 
which represents reality, can be interpreted as a builder and enabler of knowledge. Besides i-
doc can facilitate the teaching and understanding of the curricular contents, the exploitation 
of i-doc can be also a great method to develop innovative contents that promote a 
differentiating journalism and that reinforce its social function, as this project proposed in 
environmental education. Another point of view suggested by the author, is that UX Design 
is essential to the planning of communicative relations between people, digital objects and 
real life. At the present, with all the technological evolutions established more and more 
faster, will be important to understand better how users interact, immerse and participate 
with those evolutions. Digital and physical interactions are both essential, and the author 
intends to interconnect them, creating one digital object about Ajuda botanical garden, that 



 
 

may promote the interest of users to visit it, physically, and be more awareness for its 
importance. 

 

Key words: botanical gardens, citizenship, design, education, immersive journalism, 
interactive documentary, science communication, transdisciplinarity.

 Resumo 

Este estudo explora a narrativa interactiva utilizando a multimodalidade no formato 
do documentário interactivo (i-doc), que se materializa numa proposta para comunicar 
ciência, num contexto específico. O jardim botânico mais antigo de Portugal celebra, em 
2018, 250 anos de existência e é o cenário dessa proposta. Essa escolha foi preponderante, 
pois o assunto a ser comunicado é no âmbito da Botânica e da Conservação da 
Biodiversidade e salienta a importância da cidadania na mobilização de esforços que possam 
minimizar os problemas complexos e os desafios associados a essas temáticas.  

Em Comunicação de Ciência, o formato i-doc tem sido pouco explorado e, nesse 
sentido, este trabalho pretende obter uma contribuição empírica original que abra caminho 
a novas abordagens, nesse sentido. Vídeos 360, realidade virtual e realidade aumentada 
podem ser explorados e remixados com os meios tradicionais, com vista à promoção de um 
maior envolvimento das pessoas com a Botânica e ciências relacionadas. A 
transdisciplinaridade é uma componente chave deste projecto que interpreta o Design, não 
apenas nas diversas perspectivas como disciplina, mas também como uma área científica de 
extrema utilidade e que permite construir pontes entre diferentes áreas.  

Articulando narrativa, jogos e multimodalidade, foi produzido um protótipo e 
realizada a sua prova de conceito, em duas turmas: estudantes de Biologia e Geologia do 
ensino secundário e estudantes de mestrado em Jornalismo e Novos Media, e os respectivos 
professores estiveram envolvidos no processo. A pesquisa-acção foi aplicada de uma maneira 
original, pretendendo agregar valor a contextos práticos e planear acções direccionadas. A 
revisão bibliográfica, questionários, entrevistas semiestruturadas, observação participante e 
focus group foram as técnicas utilizadas para testar e avaliar o conceito inerente ao projecto. 
Os resultados obtidos são favoráveis à utilidade e viabilidade da ideia e será interessante 
investigar de forma mais sistemática, para compreender melhor as oportunidades na 
intersecção entre ciência, tecnologia e arte. As emoções, cognição e design centrado no ser 
humano são áreas de estudo muito interessantes para investigar.  

O autor argumenta que o i-doc, em vez de ser apenas um canal ou um meio digital, 
que representa a realidade, pode ser interpretado como um construtor e um facilitador do 
conhecimento. Além de poder facilitar o ensino e a compreensão dos conteúdos curriculares, 
a exploração do i-doc também pode ser um método muito útil para desenvolver conteúdos 
inovadores que promova um jornalismo diferenciador e reforce sua função social, como é 
proposto na educação ambiental. Outro ponto de vista sugerido pelo autor, é que o UX 
Design é essencial para o planeamento das relações comunicativas entre as pessoas, os 
objectos digitais e a vida real. No presente, com todas as evoluções tecnológicas estabelecidas 
cada vez mais rápidas, será importante entender melhor como os utilizadores interagem, 
imergem e participam nos conteúdos, com todas essas evoluções. Interacções físicas e digitais 
são essenciais, e este projecto pretende interligá-las, criando um objecto digital sobre o jardim 



 
 

botânico da Ajuda, que possa promover o interesse dos utilizadores em visitá-lo 
pessoalmente e uma maior consciência da sua importância e valorização.

1. Introduction 

1.1 Context 

The objective of this project is to build an active relational communication between 

people, digital tools, techniques and practices where Design1 is a root language of the whole 

process to communicate science. The interactivity, participation and immersion are the 

engines that are explored, using interactive documentary (i-doc) as a tool to promote greater 

engagement of formal school’s communities in issues such Botany, Botanical Gardens, 

Biodiversity´s Conservation and Citizenship.  

This exploratory study in science communication intersects science, art and 

technology, drawing on several studies. One of them, which is based on the topic of 

transdisciplinary design, opens horizons for the social process of research in design, 

education and practices (da Silva Vieira, 2018). Thus, it is intended to investigate the 

potentiality of design practice to other areas of human activity and the transfer of knowledge, 

beyond the domain of design as a discipline. 

Intuition and the combustion of multiple ideas are a pillar of the whole process, not 

forgetting to balance the inherent limitations, competences and the refinement of reality to 

consolidate the vision, mission and theory of social change involved in this project. Based 

on different studies and approaches, are used multimodality, storytelling and gaming to 

realize a demo-production of a hybrid i-doc, intersecting two specific arenas in the field of 

Science Communication: Science Education and Immersive Science Journalism, mediating 

between the text and the audiovisual formats. In an increasingly visual society, the demand 

for new forms and technologies of communication has increased, where multimodal 

language tends to become dominant and there is a growing need to study multimodality in 

different areas, such as education, arts and other professional contexts (Vieira &amp;amp; Silvestre, 

2015).

better explained in the theoretical framework, with more detail and in the contextualized action 
associated to the present research

1.2 Motivation 

The author of this work has an academic background in Agronomy Engineering and 

over the last 20 years she has worked in several areas, like pharmaceutical industry, 

agricultural services, marketing of organic farming products and, in education, teaching 

mathematics and natural sciences in basic and secondary levels, in formal and non-formal 

contexts. In the last 5 years, her professional activity has been focused in environmental 

education, with several types of audience, mainly school groups. She has been developing 

these activities in different entities in Lisbon, which has been an enriching experience given 

the complementarity of the actions, in the fields of: Conservation, Taxonomy and 

Identification of Plant Species, Horticulture and Life Cycle of Food and in Forest 

Management - Native Biodiversity and Conservation. She thinks that people have a genuine 

interest in these topics, despite the lack of knowledge. People need to be involved in a more 

continuous and participative way, in contextualized actions, being urgent to explore new 

communication approaches, remixing new digital technologies within the traditional ones 

and researching new methods and practices, to improve the quality of communication´s 

scientific issues. 

 Nowadays, she is studying science communication and wants to converge her 

experience in this area, exploring interactive practices and technics that can engage and unify 

people to achieve common goals. In the classes of Techniques and Practices in Science 

Communication she was curious about the application of non-linear narratives and the 

format of the interactive documentary as a communication tool. It was thus an impetus for 

this work project along with the other seminaries attended during the master’s course. Being 

able to turn problems in opportunities is a motivation that has been with her for a long time 

and so, she wants to stimulate an iterative and problem-solving approach process, in the field 

of environmental issues, where Design and Quality2 are key sources.  

 

 

 

 

 

                                                           
2 In this project, the term Quality can be understood in the first paragraph of this reference: 
https://explora.live/2017/11/24/featured-content/ and, in the scope of the last edition of the 
International Norm ISO/FDIS 9001:2015, Quality Management Systems – Requirements, with focus on the 
item 8.3 – Design and development of products and services and the cycle PDCA – Plan, Do, Check, Act

1.3 Objectives 

Being an initiative of social entrepreneurship, this project aims to find solutions or 

ways that can minimize social problems, in the field of science communication. Promote 

environmental education at formal level education, focusing on the importance of botany 

and biodiversity´s conservation, and its communication, as vital pillars to welfare of society. 

The logic is to explore languages and formats, involving various stakeholders and seeking to 

involve and empower the specific target audience for this subject: academic communities, 

initially students of regular secondary education and university students of journalism. At 

this point, is not intended to develop a final product but to give life to an iterative dynamic 

that can improve a social transformation, with focus in education, in a long term.  

This research is exploratory and is devoted to the study and its application in 

education experiences to promote engagement in Botany and related sciences.  The focus is 

to explore i-doc as a valuable tool to be used in contextualized classroom´s activities that can 

promote awareness to environment issues in the short term and be adapted with a long-term 

vision. Thinking about specific problems associated with science communication, more than 

treating the symptoms is intended to investigate the causes trying to create conditions to 

build better communicational practices. In 2018, the oldest botanic garden in Portugal, Ajuda 

Botanical Garden (JBA), celebrates 250 years, despite it isn´t so well known by Portuguese 

people, and so it is the main scenario to prototype one digital object, which simulates one 

hybrid i-doc.  

Is intended to develop one concept that can be represented for one prototype, using 

the genre interactive documentary that serves as a model for analysis and evaluation by two 

different types of users: Biology and Geology students from secondary school and 

Journalism students from university level. The evaluation with the students occurs in natural 

context, inside one normal classroom ant the respective teachers are involved in the process. 

On the other hand, a complementary objective is to celebrate JBA´s 250th 

anniversary, proposing to this scientific museum a new model of communication that can 

contributes to its notoriety and a better recognition by citizens. A future challenge will be to 

establish partnerships that enable the implementation of digital resources in JBA, with focus 

on audiovisual formats, like 3600 formats (photos and video), virtual and augmented reality.  

In summary, this project has the following research objectives:  

• To explore how to use i-doc to promote Botany and associated sciences in regular 

classrooms.  



 

4 

 

• To promote teaching methods from traditional practices to inquiry-based 

approaches, using innovative tools and stimulating Responsible Research and 

Innovation (RRI).  

• To provide moments of reflection, highlighting social capital (citizenship) as an 

important engine for the recovery/maintenance of memories that are part of our 

history and culture.  

• To design innovative strategies to improve science communication, using a case 

study in JBA and testing the main idea in natural context (proof of concept). 

 

1.4 Research Questions 

 

Making is one productive form of science teaching and learning that uses design, 

construction, testing and revision of a wide variety of objects, with technology and 

integrating different disciplines as art, engineering and science and actually there is a huge 

need to shift pedagogical strategies to support more reciprocal and less hierarchical ways of 

investigation (Bevan, 2017). Mainstreaming making and thinking can be a valuable proposal 

in that meaning. “But many questions remain and there is a need for further programme 

development, documentation, and research.” (Bevan, 2017, p. 24). 

This project uses one scientific theory - “Plant Blindness”3  - to promote one 

reflection and a call for action, in the context of classroom, to identify possible paths that 

can promote citizenship as a pillar for raising awareness of key issues to the human species 

and ecosystems. 

The research questions (RQ) to clarify with all the stakeholders, considering “plant 

blindness” a threat to combat, are: 

 

RQ1: Can the proposal for the multimedia hybrid be a valid medium to promote 

awareness for plant blindness and science education?  

RQ2: What added value and constraints are created with multimedia hybrid format 

when addressing plant blindness, in the context of this project?

5 

 

RQ3: Does the observation of the hybrid contribute to inform and alert to the 

importance of botanical gardens, particularly to the recognition of the JBA?  

RQ4: What are the main causes of “plant blindness” and which effects it can cause, 

particularly in the regular teaching of botany and associated sciences?

2. Theoretical Framework 

2.1 Science Communication: Challenges and Opportunities 

“Science Communication” is the broadest, inclusive and technical term that can be 

used in the context of all activities that intersect Science and Communication. Regardless of 

the public considered, the context in which communication has place, the tools used and the 

purpose of that communication (Granado &amp;amp; Malheiros, 2015). 

Nowadays, science communication is suffering a deeply process of transformation 

and, has many citizens and policy makers get information about science mainly or even 

exclusively through the media, it will be vital to analyze recent trends and tensions and their 

implications in those processes (Schäfer, 2017). In the last 20 years a lot has been achieved 

in the promotion of scientific and technological culture in Portugal and even with limitations 

arising from financial crises, both national and international, among other factors, people 

and institutions have been able to carry out this task, being essential at the present "to try to 

define more clearly what, as a society, we expect and demand from science and technology, 

and, on the other hand, what the scientific community considers useful, possible and 

desirable " (Granado &amp;amp; Malheiros, 2015). 

The expression “to understand the future, you have to look back at least twice as far 

as you’re looking ahead”, from Institute for the Future (IFTF), is useful at the present if we 

want to build solid paths with a long-term vision (McGonigal, 2011). 

In Portugal, the troubled history between the National Museum of Natural History 

and Science and the academic entities is remarkable but, in the last decades, since the 

democratization of the country, was possible to activate an internal reorganization and 

identification of the educational, cultural and social mission of this space, which is at the 

present in a "phase of great dynamism in science communication, in the identification and 

protection of the natural heritage, in the promotion of an environmental conscience" 

(Póvoas, Lopes, Melo, Correia, &amp;amp; Alves, 2016).  Scientific museums can be understood as "a 

wide range of institutions dedicated to showing science through exhibitions, which include 

museums and science centers, natural history museums, botanical gardens and zoos" 

(Delicado, 2013). In the vast field of Science Communication, many concepts are used as 

scientific literacy, scientific culture, public understanding of science (PUS), public 

engagement in science and technology (PEST), among others and, although related, each 

one delimits a potential field of research. PEST is a concept that empowers research in 

relationships among various social actors and manifests a focus of action: "it places the 

emphasis of communication on a relationship between equal citizens, whose knowledge and 



 

7 

 

hopes have equal dignities, whose opinions must be respected, in a true dialogue between 

specialists and common people instead of a lesson where some speak and others just listen." 

(Granado &amp;amp; Malheiros, 2015). 

In the context of science communication, social semiotic is an useful studying area 

in the clarification of opportunities in the resources used, especially when using various types 

of language and modes of representation: mediation between text and audiovisual as an 

essentially qualitative and dynamic methodological proposal, is an interesting way to explore 

in the study of the effectiveness of media, involving the main actors in the communication 

process, producers and consumers of scientific knowledge (Pinto &amp;amp; Zagalo, 2016). In an 

increasingly visual world, where audiovisual content proliferates, teaching and 

communication through moving images is more and more important for educators and 

academics in all areas (Eriksson &amp;amp; Sørensen, 2012). 

In relation to Botany, two researchers, Wandersse and Schussler, created the term 

"botanical blindness" in 1998, after several years of study on the perception of the public 

about plants4. This theory defends a botanical neglect on the part of the society, that is 

analyzed by Salatino and Buckeridge (2016) in a work whose title is: “De que te serve saber 

Botânica?” (a possible translation: "But why is good for you to know Botany?"). In this 

context, those researchers point out several reasons for this reality, not only in Brazil but 

elsewhere in the world, showing a vicious cycle in several fields of action, where the school 

(at various levels of education) and the media stand out: 

 

“(…) Media have enormous influence in molding society's trends and behaviors. The 

potential of the media as complementary agents to the actions of parents and teachers in the 

scientific training of the people is undeniable. Educational programs can make a substantial 

contribution to mitigating the effects of botanical blindness. Unfortunately, most journal 

articles and videos of scientific nature have been characterized by zoocentric attitudes. Even 

high-profile and respectable media productions, such as the BBC, are included in this group. 

(…)” (Salatino &amp;amp; Buckeridge, 2016, p. 190) 

 

In a time of great changes and convergence of the media, it is imperative to explore 

and experiment new languages, formats and practices that foster one of the major objectives 

of the Science Communication: to reach and engage audiences through resources and

strategies that promote greater involvement and responsibility. The interest in Botany and 

related sciences can be enhanced with innovative formats that promote the stimulation of 

the senses and the motivation for discovery. 

Digital storytelling is a multimedia practice that, with multimodality, manifests 

complexity not only at the production level but also in the final interpretation, in the 

consumption of these formats: the interaction between the different modes of representation 

of the stories (such as text, images, sounds) is preponderant in the conception and delineation 

of storytelling, as well as in the understanding of the effects produced on the consumers, 

who are not just recipients of information but participants in the construction of narratives 

(Alonso, Molina, &amp;amp; Requejo, 2013). With the adoption of Web 2.0 tools in the scientific field, 

the ability to communicate effectively is even more a vital competency, since along with the 

inherent advantages of a participatory culture and technological convergence, new challenges 

also arise and even threats, such as the legitimacy and quality of science (Azevedo &amp;amp; 

Moutinho, 2014). These authors warned of some implications of the explosion of content 

that has been generated by people on the Web and that contribute to the change of habits 

and expectations: "The boundary between amateur and professional researcher will blur and 

the number of traditionally scientific authors and extra-institutional authors who claim the 

scientific status of their work will grow." In the future scenario of science, as we predict here, 

scientific production can easily be reviewed, evaluated, voted upon and commented upon by 

virtually everyone. " (Azevedo &amp;amp; Moutinho, 2014, p. 4). The same authors quote Henry 

Jenkins about the phrase with which he begins the introduction of his book “Cultura da 

Convergência” (Convergence Culture): "Welcome to the culture of convergence, where old 

and new media collide, where the corporate media and alternative media, where the power 

of the media producer and the power of the consumer interact in unpredictable ways. " 

(Azevedo &amp;amp; Moutinho, 2014, p. 2). Recently, Sir Tim Berners-Lee shared his vision for the 

future of the web and how it will achieve its true potential in the service of humanity, along 

with the growing threats in recent years, highlighting three main trends which must be 

tackled: loss of control of personal data, ease of disseminating fake news on the web and 

political advertising online with little transparency ("Three challenges for the web, according 

to its inventor," 2017). 

Considering the advantages associated with the online presence of scientists and 

researchers, a recent study evidenced the difference between online presence and use of 

social networks (having a social network profile does not necessarily mean being present) 

and showed some skepticism in the use of social networks by researchers, which will be 



 

9 

 

interesting to analyze in a perspective of new approaches (Greifeneder, Pontis, Blandford, 

Attalla, &amp;amp; Neal, 2017). “Citizen science is the engagement of the public in science or 

monitoring to address real world problems. Citizen science programs have the ability to 

provide excellent data for researchers at large spatial and temporal scales.” (Traynor, Lee, &amp;amp; 

Duke, 2017, pp. 740, Abstract). Thinking about the quality and credibility of science 

communication and public debate one important issue appears – democracy in science – and 

one interesting fact is that very little has been explored to choose, adapt and evaluate 

information for specific contexts and public´s needs, instead, a lot of efforts have been 

developed to limit the circulation or even censoring some contents, as the case of the Italian 

immunologist who promoted one debate about vaccination in 2016 through his own 

Facebook page and canceled later all comments by claiming: “Here only those who have 

studied can comment, not the common citizen. Science is not democratic.” (Bucchi, 2017). 

In the Meeting with Science and Technology in Portugal 2017, Heitor Alvelos, 

director of ID+ Research Institute for Design, Media and Culture from the University of 

Porto (School of Fine Arts), informs about the 2 main missions of his research group: the 

re-registration and re-calibration of traditional media, often considered obsolete, that 

through design can re-assume an important role and, on the other hand, the critical 

interpretation of the impact of new media, especially digital, on the social, cultural and 

economic health of our society. Also, highlights the strong link between design and 

communication, focusing on the audiovisual sector, and reinforces the need for greater 

visibility and recognition of design as a scientific territory, exploring and establishing bridges 

between different areas.5 Design-based approaches offer a range of potentialities and 

interfaces for innovative actions, especially in the interconnection of Design and Education, 

promoting engagement in sustainability and pro-environmental behavior among young 

students (Mouchrek, 2017). In one recent PhD dissertation was studied Design as a planner 

for communicative relationships between things and people and the possible interpretive 

actions of the utility of things, to facilitate the planning and implementation of useful artifacts 

to people in various contexts (Miñana, 2017). The concept STEAM can be seen as the 

evolution from STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) by the 

integration of Arts, but, in a deeply sense the acronym STEAM is related to 

interdisciplinarity, creativity, authentic or real-world learning and project-centered thinking, 

where Design Thinking is vital to support an expanded view of STEAM experiences, in

particularly in education contexts, promoting creative thinking, collaboration, student 

ownership and responsibility of their learning (Henriksen, 2017). 

“(…) We argue that the science communication community should take active steps 

to integrate with the science education community and provide practical, facilitative support 

for its counterpart, especially in primary and secondary school education. The more support, 

and the sooner it is delivered, the better. If the two communities are to achieve their mutual 

objectives, we should make full use of science education as a main channel for the 

improvement of public scientific literacy and the continued construction of scientific culture. 

(…)” (Donghong, 2008, p. 152) 

 “(…) The current attention to issues of professionalism and professionalization in 

science communication may be taken as a sign of the growing maturity in practice, education 

and research in the field. This article suggests that greater care should be taken in how this 

process is understood. As outlined above, it should be seen as a process that is bringing 

benefits to those working in the field but also as a process that may never be completed, in 

that science communication takes its place alongside formally recognized professions. (…)”  

(Trench, 2017, p. 6). “(…) It would represent dangerous hubris if (professional) science 

communicators were to define the practice of science communication as theirs alone. 

University education and other activities in the field should aim to support the present 

specialists and prepare the future ones to facilitate scientists in doing public communication 

as much as to do it themselves.” (Trench, 2017, p. 7). 

In the context of environmental education, Edgar Morin´s theory of complexity can 

be better explored as a theoretical tool, where knowledge is produced by the actors involved 

in a collaborative and participative way, stimulating the potential of the transition from linear 

knowledge (specialization) to an interdisciplinary approach and its intrinsic relationships, 

where practical and theoretical knowledge can inhabit the same space, influencing each other 

(de Jesus Pereira, Friede, Narduchi, &amp;amp; de Miranda, 2017). 

 

2.2 Immersive Journalism: New Formats and Practices 

The adoption of mobile technologies in Journalism practices opens the way to new 

(re) configurations and it will be interesting, in this scenario, to highlight the role of 

journalism, regardless of the media form of publication (press, radio, television, online) 

(Vicente).  At the present, it is extremely important to rethink the role of the journalist. The 

Internet has broken with formats, practices and supports and with standards of objectivity 

and impartiality. When the journalist assumes a look and a voice, her or his record 



 

11 

 

distinguishes itself from others and resists the trivialization of information: the image as a 

testimony of the reality closest to the truth, allied to storytelling, a journalistic technique that 

manifests itself in the "art of telling a story", act as a solution to the homogenization of 

content and the disinterest of the public (Lind, 2015). 

The use of new languages that stimulate the senses of consumers will not unfeasible 

the rigor of the facts, inherent to the journalistic essence, and, immersive journalism can be 

identified with the use of a hybrid language that brings together elements of the digital game, 

entertainment and reporting, on a way to explore (G. G. da Rocha, 2016). Immersive 

journalism starts from the premise that the journalist must know the reality he wants to 

transmit to his audience: immersion of the journalist is a necessary condition for the 

subsequent immersion of his audience (Martín, 2013).  

 Although the concepts of immersion and immersive journalism do not have a 

consensus among the various authors, there is a tendency of a logic of transposing 

consciousness towards a reallocation of realities, triggered psychologically or through 

technical resources: immersion should not be confused with sensory stimulation and not 

only related to technology, but may manifest itself in different levels of diving and interaction 

(Cordeiro &amp;amp; Costa, 2016). Journalism has always worked with the representation of reality, 

whether using traditional media, such as the text, or, with the evolution of practices, the 

combination of multimedia media such as images, sounds, animations, among others. New 

experiences are a reality today and it is possible to note that the trend of immersive reporting 

is intended to establish a journalistic narrative with greater user participation, encouraging 

their interest in the news, placing it in the place of events and thus, as the journalist , to be a 

witness of the facts (da Costa &amp;amp; Brasil, 2017).  

Eva Dominguez, in her doctoral thesis, analyzes the investigations carried out in the 

field of immersive journalism which, in the digital sphere, understands as an interactive 

narrative construction that should foster immersion capacity. She describes the opinion of 

some authors, such as Nonny de la Peña, regarding the use of virtual reality technology, 

considered a fertile field of investigation, which not only enhances visual but also immersive 

ability in a first-person experience. On the other hand, she highlights the interaction with 

digital content as a feature with immense potential, not merely functional but also narrative 

(Martín, 2013).   

Immersive journalism can be understood under two principles: from the point of 

view of production, which requires the author to have an in-depth level of research and 

reflection on the reality to be represented and, from a technical or technological point of 



 

12 

 

view, where the result of production will be materialized in immersive formats, such as virtual 

reality productions, augmented reality, infographics, photos and videos in 360?, that will 

allow different sensory experiences comparing with traditional audiovisual formats (Cordeiro 

&amp;amp; Costa, 2016). In the last study carried out by ERC, Regulatory Entity for Social 

Communication in Portugal, regarding the new dynamics of audiovisual consumption in 

Portugal: 

“In relation to the audiovisual consumption by equipment, following the television, 

the mobile phone / smartphone is the device with the greatest presence in the Portuguese 

home (75.2%), followed by the laptop / laptop computer (52.9%), (48.5%), desktop / 

desktop (32.5%), tablet (30.2%) and game consoles (26.2%). Regarding the type of 

audiovisual consumption, "information" is the most sought-after segment (89.5%), followed 

by stock products "telenovelas", "films" and "series" with an average of 56.3%. The 

"entertainment", with 50.3%, precedes "documentaries" (47.2%) and "sports" (44.6%).” (C. 

Martins, 2016, p. 25) 

 

Information and entertainment are the most popular segments. Infotainment is a 

concept that intersects two segments - information and entertainment - and which has been 

increasingly manifesting itself on the Internet, requiring a research effort to better understand 

the associated processes and potentialities to this phenomenon of communication, taking 

into account the author, content and effects produced in audiences (Berrocal Gonzalo, 

Redondo García, &amp;amp; Campos Domínguez, 2012). Assuming the principles that better 

informed citizens make more responsible decisions and that, rather than pondering whether 

journalism should inform or entertain, it is important to study its social implications and to 

address media literacy and literacy for citizenship in an integrated way in younger populations 

(Brites, 2017). “(…) Thus, news social consumptions are important elements that contribute to 

thinking about new forms of civic media literacy, more focused on social processes than in 

the quantification of knowledge and skills. (…)” (Brites, 2017, p. 147). 

According to the National Environmental Education Strategy6 (ENEA 2020) for the 

period 2017-2020, recommendations for the media are (p. 25): “Reinforce environmental 

education in the academic curricula of media schools; Encourage the continuous 

environmental training of media professionals, through the organization of training actions, 

seminars, journeys, among others; Strengthen the educational dimension of environmental

information, using a language that is understandable and accessible to the majority of the 

population, without losing scientific rigor; Create spaces in the media, fixed and stable, 

specializing in environmental issues.”  

With the evolution of digital media and creative technologies, there have been 

significant changes in the production and distribution of stories, and new strategies have 

emerged based on assumptions that are strongly different from traditional ones (Noronha, 

Zagalo, &amp;amp; Martins, 2012).  

Interaction, participation and immersion are three key concepts to understand digital 

communication. “The stories of the future (or many of them, at least) will not just be told. 

They will be actively experienced. And interactivity, participation and immersion will 

continue to be among the core concepts that we will need to soundly understand in order to 

successfully engage in a creative process that is successful in terms of audience reach and on 

its own creative goals.” (Soler-Adillon, 2017, p. 6) 

In the context of classroom environmental education, the use of emerging 

technologies, such as virtual reality and augmented reality, must be confronted with the 

educational objective to be achieved, with the classroom dynamics and the specific context 

of learning, requiring the consideration of various issues and recommendations (García, 

Ortega, &amp;amp; Zednik). The new strategies for integrating interactive elements into digital 

educational resources will allow students to be more active in relation to content, facilitating 

learning and promoting greater attractiveness and satisfaction (Tomaz, 2011). It has been 

demonstrated that, in the search for new approaches to attract attention to scientific topics 

(such as climate change) by using online games, it is possible to integrate narrative and gaming 

promoting the creation of innovative communication solutions (Ouariachi, Olvera-Lobo, &amp;amp; 

Gutiérrez-Pérez, 2017).  

At the present, journalistic contents that exploit interactivity and multimodality by 

adding gameplay characteristics are still scarce, most of them use the choice of links and little 

else. In education, gamification has shown positive results but, in the media communication, 

initiatives are not expressive. Newsgames can be an excellent educational and communicational 

tool, promoting a differentiated journalism (Silva &amp;amp; Barboza, 2018). 

Digital media are currently protagonists of a new materiality, not only technological 

but understood as an instance of communication and it is increasingly necessary a 

classification of emerging narrative species (taxonomy) and the development of a multimodal 

notation that allows the consolidation of immersive journalism, which is becoming more and 

more a medium of experience (Vicente, 2017). This author points to an unsustainable 



 

14 

 

reduction of digital media to the status of "remediation" of previous forms of 

communication, when they are interpreted just only as channels or supports, and not as 

different creative substances, or new languages, and it is extremely important distinguish 

between the digitization of mass media - a reconversion of the species - and the digital nature 

of new media. In his view, it is fundamental to organize a grammar that supports producers 

and consumers in defense of a human-centered design, and not just in technological 

attributes. 

 

2.3 Digital Storytelling and Interactive Documentary 

The interactive documentary (i-doc) is a recent genre without rigid definitions, and it 

has manifested one rapid development with the technological advances, in an 

interdisciplinary environment, intersecting areas of knowledge and creativity from the cinema 

and audiovisual, the programming, interactivity and design interfaces (Amorim &amp;amp; Baldi, 

2013). In this emerging environment, the documentary is reformulated in an attitude of 

experimentation and an updated look at the possibilities it can manifest: nonlinear, 

interactive, multimedia, hybrid, convergent, immersive, virtual, 360º, collaborative, 

participatory, among others, some still unknown (Nash, Hight, &amp;amp; Summerhayes, 2014). 

Sandra Gaudenzi views interactive documentary as a new entity that does not follow 

the continuity of traditional documentary, and should not be confined to the simple act of 

human-machine interaction, alerting to a greater systemic understanding of the process 

(Gaudenzi, 2013b).  

One of the premises of the traditional documentary is the desire to organize a story 

that associates the informational and the entertaining role, and in this sense, the interactive 

documentary must keep this tradition as efficient, original and attractive as possible (Castells, 

2011). In the articulation between the conventional format, with a linear structure, strong 

authorial and unidirectional in the relation with the spectator, and the documentary with 

interactive characteristics, it is taken into account the remodeling of discourse and aesthetics, 

for a more participatory culture that promotes an active construction of knowledge (Gouveia 

&amp;amp; Antunes, 2011). The interactive documentary constitutes an aesthetic change, organizing 

the content in levels of interactivity that establish functions for the user-spectator, within 

different possibilities of interaction (Levin, 2015). 

The first symposium about interactive documentary was held in 2011 at the Digital 

Cultures Research Center (DCRC) at the University of the West of England, in Bristol. Since 



 

15 

 

then, three more symposia have been held in 2012, 2014 and 2016 and recently a book has 

been published that brings together several works on this format to date, which can be seen 

in the words of Prof. Brian Winston (in the foreword to this book) as a very useful 

cartographic work that reconfigures the boundaries between author, product and viewer, 

enhancing hybrid formats, at the boundaries between these elements (Aston, Gaudenzi, &amp;amp; 

Rose, 2017). According to these authors, the definition of interactive documentary is open 

and generally frames "any project that begins its intention to engage with reality and uses 

interactive digital technology to accomplish this purpose". Since there is a secular tradition 

related to cinema and therefore to the documentary genre, in which the constitutive raw 

material is originally a moving image, a generalist approach to the term documentary, 

associated with the current scenario of the production of new formats, can be seen as a 

semantic abuse that should not be neglected (Almeida &amp;amp; Alvelos, 2010). I-docs appear 

therefore paradoxically not only as the future venue for documentary film and for cinema at 

large, but also as a tribute to documentary films ‘own past and origins (Favero, 2013, p. 274). 

The complexity and innovation associated with the establishment of interactive 

documentary in the last ten years, in parallel with the evolution of Web 2.0, has prompted 

Sandra Gaudenzi to carry out her doctoral thesis, looking at this format as a “living 

documentary” and proposing a classification in four families: hypertextual, conversational, 

participatory and experiential, a way of classification, which although not the only one, helps 

to understand the concept of interactivity, briefly indicated below (Gaudenzi, 2013b): 

• Hypertextual: adopts a hypertextual form as it establishes links between the various 

objects (such as videos) of a closed database, allowing the user to explore the 

preprogrammed options. Also called webdocumentary (web-doc).  

• Conversational: uses 3D virtual worlds that allow the user a freedom to explore the 

content, in a logic that the interaction simulates reality, as if the user is positioned in 

a continuous "conversation" with the computer. 

• Participatory: it addresses the logic of one open database and an evolutionary way, 

that is, the contents can be added by both users and authors, in one group of 

construction that remains for as long as there are interested people. 

• Experiential: incorporates the Global Positioning System (GPS) into an adaptation 

in dynamic environment, that is, as the user moves in a physical space their senses 

will be challenged by the addition of information layers. 



 

16 

 

“What Living Documentaries allow us to do is to look at interactive documentaries 

as dynamic entities that co-emerge while they live through the interactions with the Internet, 

their users, subject, producers, or any acting entity They put the emphasis on becoming, rather 

than explaining.” (Gaudenzi, 2013a, p. 26). The web documentary will then be a form of 

interactive documentary, since the first one highlights the support where the interactivity 

takes place (the Internet) and the second puts the interactivity as the central aspect to take 

into account, something that is not only present on the Internet (Penafria, 2014).  

 The possibilities of the interactive documentary, in which the interactivity is intrinsic, 

bring several tensions, from various angles and points of view, namely about the need to 

explore what is a narrative, about the representation of reality and its main purpose and the 

role of the author. The freedom of users in an interactive documentary can proportionally 

reduce the author's point of view and author´s ability to argue, with a considerable risk in 

terms of user involvement, which may compromise or even cancel the author's purpose 

(Forceville, 2017).  Based on the premise of user participation as expected, the interactive 

documentary establishes a specific position of the audience in relation to its content, and it 

will be interesting to evaluate who speaks, the extent of reciprocity, and how the audience 

positions itself in that exchange (Levin, 2015). A new and creative imagery scenario has 

emerged, with the use of interactive digital languages and technological devices to narrate 

stories, but it will be important not to forget the hermeneutical purposes involved in the 

dialogic stories or underestimate the semantic thickness of texts (Amorim &amp;amp; Baldi, 2013). 

Nonlinear narratives have been seen as threats to the authorial voice but, in this new genre 

as interactive documentary, are a great opportunity to share more varied and immersive 

experiences and to satisfy three needs of the interactors: entertainment, education and 

communication with other participants (Castells, 2011). In relation to the tensions associated 

with authorship, Sandra Gaudenzi reinforces the authors' role in a process centered on end 

users, with the following considerations: “What is left in the hands of the author is the 

intentionality of the project: its general story/idea, the choice of who it is aimed at and the 

delineation of its final purpose. I-docs storytellers are more facilitators than narrators and, 

together with a creative team, they are responsible for the coherence of the final user 

experience.” (Aston et al., 2017, p. 126). 

 In journalism, the transformation of digital storytelling, along with the evolution of 

interactive documentaries produced in the last twenty years, has manifested itself in a wide 

spectrum of techniques and approaches in the design and production of the interactive 

documentary, and so there is no single standard of design (Pavlik &amp;amp; Pavlik, 2017). How to 



 

17 

 

explain that since 2005 hundreds of interactive documentaries have been published on the 

internet and that, despite the apparent success, most of them do not involve their users in an 

effective way? To try to answer this question, Samuel Gantier and Michel Labor proposed a 

methodology based on the evaluation of user experience, in the context of the production 

of a web-doc in the television environment, to try to perceive the tensions associated when 

"real users" are not at the center of the productive process (Aston et al., 2017, pp. 101-116). 

These authors support the idea that the heterogeneity of decision-makers, who participate in 

the production of an interactive documentary, tends to be oriented in different "user models" 

without verifying who the "real users" are. Sandra Gaudenzi has studied, within her research 

project i-doc UX Series, the misunderstandings and clashes between expectations and 

creative approaches to the elements that make up the production teams. And, in this sense, 

thinking about the user experience versus author experience dichotomy from the perspective 

of User Centered Design (UCD), Gaudenzi recalls that without a hearing there can be no 

design in which: “Designing for, and with, an audience means committing to an aesthic, a 

platform and a language that best suit such an audience – even if these do not fit with the 

personal taste of the author. The question here is not to `please´ the audience, but to ´make 

sense´ for such audience” (Aston et al., 2017, pp. 121-122).  

 William Uricchio in an analysis of the future possibilities of the documentary in a 

historical perspective, ends his contribution with the phrase: “Our task is neither to lament 

the passing of the old nor grow frantic over the emergence of the new, but rather to assess 

carefully and critically their capacities and implications for documentary practice and 

representational literacy more broadly” (Aston et al., 2017, p. 203).  

In a recent research was highlighted nonlinearity, as a central trend to contemporary 

ways of seeing and living, and, interactive documentary as a rich field of enquiry and a 

valuable methodological tool for geographers (Harris, 2017). Liz Miller is one researcher who 

argues that interactive documentary is a format with extreme potential in education 

(@i_docs, 2017). In a recent study, the authors suggest "new best practices" for university 

journalism students to think and act as web designers in creating the interactive documentary 

format, alerting journalists and educators in this field to adapt to this challenging 

environment in constant change (Gyori &amp;amp; Charles, 2017). Things acquire meaning from the 

moment they are used in specific activities and contexts and according to the interpretations 

that people are able to conceive from the meanings that the things offer them (Miñana, 2017). 

In one recent study, is pointed the main use of web documentary to create awareness about 

social issues, the lack of use of that format in science communication and the needs of further 



 

18 

 

investigation about that approach, to connect people to identity, memory and places and 

promote plural perspectives about one specific subject (Casella, 2018). 

2.4 Remix and UX Design 

In a recent academic work, the concept of Remix is analyzed and validated as an 

aesthetic resource of great utility to develop a critical spirit and to promote a creative process: 

inherent in the culture of the remix are actions such as cut, copy and paste, activities that 

characterize some of its creation processes, which by combining and recombining existing 

or original material, analog and digital are retransformed into new communicative 

possibilities (Sousa, 2017). The documentary “Everything is a Remix Remastered” (2015) 

from Kirby Ferguson7 is commented in that work in which analyzes the use of remix in 

different areas such as music, engineering, science, internet, among others, bringing a new 

perspective to the uses of the remix, questioning the absolute originality, the fact that 

everything is created from an existing creation. “The remix can thus be considered as a form 

of speech, that is, it can be understood as a linguistic tool for a particular audience. This tool 

offers the public grammar that, when assimilated and understood, enables them to create 

information that uses the same grammatical universe. As we have seen, the remix adapts to 

the different areas where it is inserted and used in different ways, like speech, methodology 

or aesthetics” (Sousa, 2017, p. 55). 

UX Design (User Experience Design) is a complex concept. “To the uninitiated, UX 

design can seem like an intimidating field. The sheer number of topics it touches is mind-

boggling: there’s interaction design (the psychology of motion and feedback), design thinking 

(an iterative, empathy-based problem-solving process), and usability (how easily a product 

can be used), just to name a few. Nevertheless, that’s also what makes the field so fascinating 

to so many people.” (Foundation, p. Preface). According to Peter Morville, a reference in 

the field of UX study, there are 7 factors that describe and facilitate the understanding of the 

UX Design concept, indicated in the image 1, below:

The premise of this project is Design thinking that can be understood as a problem-

solving approach to improve design of creative solutions, and the communicative proposes 

of the strategic action are: 

• Developing familiarity with the topic plant blindness (PB) and associate it to 

Botanical Gardens (specifically JBA) and their importance to society putting into 

practice Responsible Research and Innovative (RRI)  

• Raising awareness of causes and consequences about plant blindness promoting 

citizenship and responsibility on topics as Biodiversity, Conservation and 

Sustainability 

• Stimulating the development of ideas and solutions to attenuate PB, promoting a 

better plant science communication, with focus in a case study in JBA, using 

innovative digital media and exploring interactivity, immersiveness and participation 

in classrooms of different levels of education 

Mainstreaming the social sciences in conservation, incorporating social science 

research and insights in natural science and conservation is seen as an unique and important 

contribution to society´s understanding of the relationships between humans and nature ant 

to advancing conservation practices and outcomes (Bennett et al., 2017). “(…) A productive 

engagement with the conservation social sciences will likely require long-term ongoing 

partnerships, knowledge and capacity building, open dialogue, clear communication, 

reflection on past and present practice, and a willingness to adapt programs of work. A more 

inclusive conservation science (i.e., one that includes methods and insights from the natural 

sciences, the social sciences, and the humanities) will enable the conservation community to 



 

20 

 

produce more ecologically effective and socially just conservation. Mainstreaming the 

conservation social sciences will facilitate the uptake of the full range of insights and 

contributions from these fields into conservation policy and practice” (Bennett et al., 2017, 

p. 65).  

Journalism can have an important role in its own activities, strengthening the 

dissemination of knowledge about conservation of nature and becoming a bridge to create 

“spaces of environmental education”. It is important to investigate the potential learning, 

socialization and innovation that are capable to support and encourage sustainable choices 

and the social change among young people - and the possible strategies for design-based 

interventions (Mouchrek, 2017). “The practice with various pedagogical models of online 

learning, in the context of several Portuguese and European universities, has demonstrated 

that it is not enough provide the student with pre-formatted teaching / learning models, 

supported by standard virtual environments or in the teacher's educational communication, 

it should also be given to each student the opportunity to choose his / her own personal 

learning environmental (PLE) by adding the tools and resources that best fit his / her style 

and personal goals in a given context. (…) The rather common attempt to use the computer 

with the mere aim of making learning more attractive is failure. It is necessary to use 

pedagogical models that can ensure the effectiveness of cognitive processes, which provide 

a better understanding of the subjects and simultaneously provide great satisfaction to 

learners, using new interactive multimedia environments.” (Bidarra, 2011, p. 13). “In addition 

to the curricular content foreseen in formal education, exhibitions and museographic 

elements have the important role of instigating following aspects: a) Manual interactivity; b) 

Mental interactivity; c) Interactivity cultural. Emotion lies at the basis of the three classes of 

interactivity presented.” (Lamim-Guedes, 2018, p. 87). “There is a need for greater 

interaction between museums and schools, including public policies and private actions that 

positively stimulate the association between these institutions. In this sense, it is important 

to carry out activities that bring teachers inside the museum, demonstrating better ways of 

using museum space and expositions, in an articulated way with the contents approached in 

the classroom. On the other hand, traveling exhibitions are an important way of taking the 

museum to schools and communities.” (Lamim-Guedes, 2018, p. 91). 

In this context, is interesting to explore the mobilizing and educational potential of 

interactive documentary in formal education, as a science communication tool, in botany 

classes and in journalism classes. Using Ajuda Botanical Garden (JBA) as a scenario to test 

the proof of concept of this project, rather than expressing a specific point of view in that

format, is intended to develop an orchestra of debate and reflection around the central 

theme, botany and conservation of biodiversity as a vital pillar of environmental 

sustainability, and achieve some clues how to develop an interactive documentary to promote 

citizenship about those issues and that can be useful in the context of educational activity. It 

is also intended to promote new forms of interpretation and exploitation of audiovisual 

formats and digital literacy. More than producing a final product the aim of this project is 

the whole experience of the design process, where is intended to produce with the target 

audience (and not for), and so, both the research process and the development of the final 

product are equally important (although we are still at a very early stage of the project). This 

work has an exploratory approach, and the exploration focus is on the potential of interactive 

documentary to engage all the stakeholders. “Engagement is not only about looking nice but 

also about looking right.” (Foundation, p. 31). “(..) Firstly, I think it’s clear that in spite of all 

the new ways of tracking audiences: hits, clicks, shares and so on, most people are engaging 

on the inside. This isn’t unique to idocs – there are now a large number of studies in various 

contexts showing that people are much more inclined to listen than comment. (…) The 

challenge for idocs makers is to cater for the non-fan as well as the fan; to make space for 

different levels of engagement with content. In closing, I want to make a plea to all of you – 

as the idocs community we should all start to think of ourselves as audience researchers. We 

should all be looking for opportunities to work together on understanding what makes the 

idocs audience unique and being able to show funders and broadcasters the kind of impact 

this work can have.”  (@i_docs Nash, 2014) 

Despite the rapid evolution of the genre, interactive documentary, is still little known 

by the audiences, and most of the productions have been carried out focusing on the authors 

/ producers' view in a more technical way and not so much on the level of social involvement 

and the possibilities associated with this posture. That´s the aim of this project, to look how 

interactive documentary can be a great ally to induce social change in a beneficial and 

sustainable way. According to Gaudenzi (2013), is pointed the argument that i-doc, rather 

than representing reality, builds and experiences reality. According to Almeida &amp;amp; Alvelos 

(2010), in a medium of uncertainties and dilemmas, a heuristic impulse in a new orientation 

will be an important approach to searching for i-doc identity.  

“Advances in scientific visualization and public access to data have transformed 

science outreach and communication, but have yet to realize their potential impacts in the 

realm of education. Computer-based learning is a clear bridge between visualization and 

education that benefits students through adaptative personalization and enhanced access. 



 

22 

 

Building this bridge requires close partnerships among scientists, technologists, and 

educators. The Infiniscope project fosters such partnerships to produce exploration-driven 

online learning experiences that teach basic science concepts using a combination of 

authentic space science narratives, data, and images, and a personalized guided inquiry 

approach. Infiniscope includes a web portal to host these digital learning experiences, as well 

as a teaching network of educators using and modifying these experiences. Infiniscope 

experiences are built around a new theory of digital learning design that we call “education 

through exploration” (ETX) developed during the creation of successful online, interactive 

science courses offered at Arizona State University and other institutions. (…)” (Anbar, 

2018, p. abstract). Design thinking is being increasingly used for innovative efforts and being 

a subject of interest by both academics and practitioners (Engberts &amp;amp; Borgman, 2018).  

The signature of this project, XploreDesign4SciComm, can be understood based on 

the considerations of a recent work, exposed below: 

“(…), drawing action in specific situations and recognizing them as guidelines for the 

construction of meaning through design is a transdisciplinary invariant, that is, it extends to 

other practices of human activity. (…) designers prioritize values in decision-making that are 

based on emotions, intuitions, reasons, experiences and constraints; five invariant categories 

in designers.” (da Silva Vieira, 2018, p. 108). “Design is a social process of negotiation, 

interaction, rectification in which sometimes even misunderstandings contribute to a process 

rich in ambiguity and uncertainty. Each discipline has its own set of features, some 

constituting entirely parts of larger sets, some sets overlap, others are disjointed, that is, they 

don´t contain elements in common. Areas of overlap between disciplines are, in their feature 

set, also a recognized unit. (…) Each discipline or shared space finds its place and creates its 

atmosphere and influence, overlapping the aspects that have been absorbed and that have 

become predominant. Partially shared spaces between design discipline are hybrids of greater 

creative freedom, very focused on communication (theater, cinema, animation, documentary, 

digital media)” (da Silva Vieira, 2018, p. 110).

3. Methodology 

This project intends to clarify the subject under study and, regarding the nature of 

the problem, has a qualitative approach. The objectives are exploratory aiming to have a 

greater familiarity with the theme, since it is an area yet to be consolidated. The method used 

was action research where after a remix of theoretical content and a reflection on that set is 

architected an action, trying an innovative approach that can add value to practical case 

studies and plan targeted actions. It is not intended to test or confirm a hypothesis but to 

evaluate which existing theories and concepts can be applied to a given problem. For the 

development of this study, considering the delimitation of the problem, the objectives and 

method, different procedures and techniques were used:  

• Bibliographical review to find theoretical references and logical foundation about the 

involved topics 

• Interviews with people with experience in the fields of study 

• Questionnaires addressed to students involved in proof of concept 

• Focus Group to collect data through group interaction on the topic Plant Blindness, 

using the hybrid prototype (i-doc) in classrooms 

• Participation observation 

Below, the table 1 summarizes the classification of the action research developed in this 

work:

Table 1 – Adopted research design 

In this project, action research is considered as a way of researching for education, and not 

about education, a methodology that can achieve better results when it is intended to bring 

people together in the process, favoring dialogue, educational practices and critical reflection

3.1 Work Package 1 – Planning 

In the beginning, thinking about the reason of the main idea (why), for who can be 

useful, where and when to apply it, was the root to formulate the main questions at this 

phase: 

• How do I gather content? 

• How do I organize it? 

• How do I put it in a storyboard? 

• How do I get it reviewed? 

• How do I get everybody brought into the process? 

And so, the tasks in pre-production were:

• a bibliographical research to structure the line of action and to argue the usefulness 

of the interactive documentary as a favorable means to promote the teaching of 

sciences like botany and to promote the socio-environmental responsibility of 

journalism 

• point out problems that need solutions and think about how to improve new 

approaches that can join people to work together to solve actual challenges (as plant 

blindness and improvements in educational practices) 

• production and sharing, in Facebook, a pilot questionnaire about botanical gardens 

in Portugal, focusing on JBA, to verify if the oldest botanical garden in Portugal is 

known by the Portuguese (annex I) 

• participation in coffee-meetings, a iNOVA Media Lab´s event, where students, 

researchers and teachers talk informally and share their research and lines of action 

(November and December) 

• participation in tree meetings of XR Immersive Media Portugal, which is a regular 

event in Portugal created by iNOVA Media Lab (FCSH-Nova), NowHere Media and 

Chicas Poderosas, and promotes the sharing of interests, ideas and knowledge 

between all persons who want to learn and innovate in the media sphere (September, 

November and February) 

• in the first meetup in XR Immersive, Diogo Melo, Partner &amp;amp; Director of Innovation 

and Products at DIFR, manifested interest in this project and a meeting was held 

with the DIFR team, for future actions (annex II) 

• research about interactive documentaries produced and well-known up to the 

present, internationally and nationally, and select some of them to serve as a reference 

to simulate the concept to be tested - 3 references of interactive documentaries that 

helped to architect the lines of the script for demo-production:

• establish contact with Azambuja secondary school on November, personally and via 

email, with the director and professor of Biology and Geology of 11th grade, to 

ensure the possibility of carrying out the tests in the classroom (annex III). It was 

agreed that the test date would be occur at the end of February or beginning of March 



 

26 

 

• It was also agreed by the same time, personally with the teacher of master´s 

journalism, to run the test phase at FCSH - Nova, at the beginning of the second 

semester (February/March) 

The choice of the two classes was not completely random. It considered the purpose 

of the study and the fact that the author had previous contact with the Azambuja Secondary 

School, during one work developed at the Master's Science and Society seminar. Being a 

student at FCSH-NOVA and developing her project at iNOVA Media Lab also facilitated 

the choice of the master´s class to participate in the proof of concept. 

Initially, in the bibliographic search, the following keywords were used, in Portuguese 

and English, in the search engine Google, YouTube and Google Scholar: interactive 

documentary, science communication, scientific education, emerging digital media, 360 

videos, science journalism, immersive journalism, communication science and design, design 

thinking, botany teaching, environmental education, virtual reality and augmented reality, UX 

Design. Later, with meetings with other students, researchers and professionals in those 

areas, I received references such as books, scientific journals and other resources, including 

social networks references, which allowed me to explore different sources. Being the focus 

to explore the interactive documentary, this was one of the key words behind all the research, 

after which the theoretical clipping was carried out at, the same time the field and the 

respective possibilities were deepened. One important reference, in this phase, was a 

transmedia meta-documentary that reflects on the interactive documentary as a new 

audiovisual format with specific characteristics, COME/IN/DOC8. The model for 

producing an interactive documentary in 7 steps was very useful to plan in more detail the 

initial idea of the project9 . Another important reference was the work “i-docs”, a term coined 

by Sandra Gaudenzi, available in this site10, where is possible to explore several resources and 

trends, as looking for i-docs as a field to explore in education11. 

Portuguese academic theses about interactive documentaries were found, but the 

clear majority (Correia, 2015; A. d. L. C. da Rocha, 2017; de Oliveira Marques, 2016; Ferreira, 

2016; Guimarães, 2014; Quintas, 2015; Ribeiro, 2017; Rodrigues, 2013), based the study on 

analyzing or comparing existing interactive documentaries or exploring the associated

taxonomies and potentialities, without focusing the study on self-production for a specific 

purpose and including the audience in the initial process of the project, and this is a 

differentiation that is aimed to point out. On the other hand, botanical gardens, being 

scientific museums, can improve and innovate their communication, with new digital media, 

providing differentiating experiences to target-publics and promoting its recognition and 

notoriety while reinforce its social and educational role. Some academic works were taken 

into account in the audiovisual perspective (dos Reis Ramalho, 2015; Ferreira, 2016). 

Another motivation was the research about the use of 360 video and virtual reality in 

innovative journalistic formats and the need for more research on the subject (de Oliveira 

Marques, 2016). In a recent academic work, it was also emphasized the use of immersive 

media, such as 360 video and virtual reality, in the promotion of tourism in Portugal, and 

more research is needed on the use of 360 video, particularly in terms of tourism experience 

(de Oliveira Magalhães, 2017). In online research about interactive documentaries, two 

Portuguese works, with that specific attribute, were found12. In both works, it was verified 

the tendency to the format "website", based on the hyperlinks and scroll, with text and 

images, traditional photographs and videos, and, therefore, more distant from the 

cinematographic format. Any of them fall into the category of web documentary. Two award-

winning multimedia reports, both interactive narratives, were also found13, and is interesting 

to see some similarities with i-doc format. The Portuguese documentaries accessed on 

YouTube about botanical gardens in Portugal, including Ajuda Botanical Garden, are in the 

traditional format and so it is interesting to seek a differentiation, exploring the field of 

interactive documentary as a proposal to improve the communication of these scientific 

museums. The project FCSH +Lisboa14 is also a reference, a work that reinforces the 

importance of university in contemporary societies and the need to adapt it to current social 

reality, where cultural journalism and digital platforms are key fields (Ponte &amp;amp; Silva, 2017). 

This reality was vital in the planning of the project and allowed, to see connections 

between concepts, problems, experience, interventions and outcomes, in general between 

theory and practice, making possible the actions:

• to use evidences to understand the change process 

• to motivate to generate ideas for change and improve situations 

• to work with others to clarify complex problems 

An important decision was to identify what would be produced, within the human 

and technical resources and having the limitation of the time factor. Articulating Storytelling, 

Gaming and Multimodality in the i-doc format was the premise to move on to the next phase, 

being itself the planning phase an iterative process. The next phase is planned to a demo-

production of one prototype that simulates the interface of interaction with the user and that 

allows the simulation of the content, the interactions of the interface and the test of the main 

interactions, the closest to the concept designed by the author. 

3.2 Work Package 2 - Demo-Production 

There were also many iterations during this phase and an important question that 

arose was in relation how to produce the artifact that could represent, as close as possible, 

the concept to be tested with the target audience. The distinction between wireframe, 

prototype and mockup was an initial doubt but it helped later to architect the digital hybrid 

used in proof of concept. One reference that helped was this one15. For the author, it was a 

great challenge to experiment the production of audiovisual content, given the limited 

experience. What the author could present in the prototype resulted from several attempts 

and using different free digital tools. She developed 360 photographs, besides text, traditional 

photographs, used simple and in slideshow with music, proposal of games about botany and 

related sciences and a story about Ajuda Botanical Garden, written during a Storytelling 

training. Other formats, like audio design, 360 video and virtual reality, were presented only 

with practical examples of the associated possibilities, in the context of interface design 

presented. 

The main tasks in demo-production were: 

sketching and paper prototyping, based on author´s professional and academic 

experience and the theoretical framework obtained, choosing the target and context

• write the script with the described specifications of the experience to be provided to 

the audience and develop the basic design of user interfaces in PowerPoint, related 

to the multimedia system that was imagined 

• share via email the script with professionals, from audiovisual and design areas, and 

receive feed-back (annex IV) 

• mature the idea in a multimedia object that will be the reference for the proof of 

concept, articulating storytelling and gaming, in a digital prototype 

• make experiences with photos 360 and 2D photos and videos, despite the lack of 

practice of the researcher. Most of the audiovisual experiences in the prototype were 

produced by her, using her smartphone (Samsung, model GT-I9195, Android 

version 4.4.2) and Cardboard Camera in Google Play to take 360 photos 

• produce botanical games about JBA in Rise, one web-based e-learning tool in 

Articulate 360, to simulate the main idea, and compile all the information on a 

website, built later 

• study the alternatives to produce the hybrid, storytelling software as Eko Studio 

(Interlude), Klynt, Korsakow, Articulate Storyline, and choose the “best” option, 

considering the technical and temporal limitations and the ability to represent the 

concept, without using programming language 

• participation in a training course at Cenjor, a professional training center for 

journalists, on Visual Narratives, between January 29 and February 26, 2018 (the 

inscription had been made in September 2017 but only at the end of January began 

the course) and produce one narrative (text and photos) (annex V) 

• gather all the contents in one website, simulating the hybrid: 

xploredesign4scicomm.wordpress.com (annex VI) 

Both the initial pilot questionnaire, about Portuguese botanical gardens, and the 

developed narrative were based on an academic paper developed in 2013 at the higher 

institute of agronomy - (Rosa, 2013) - and a book about Ajuda botanical garden (JBA), 

published in 1999 - (Castel Branco, 1999), in addition to the author 's experience during the 

Guide training in JBA, between October 2012 and March 2013, and the experience 

accumulated with this activity in the last 5 years. The choice of content developed in the 

hybrid, botanical games mainly, focused on the themes that the 11-year classroom´s teacher

said he would be teaching in February and March. However, it was tried to take a more 

general approach, not only focused on curricular contents of Biology and Geology. 

In hybrid i-doc´s design, although are used web site’s characteristics, is tried to 

achieve one format closest to the cinematographic view and, in the content structure, are 

considered 3 axes, according to this reference16: 

• Author-User: author defines possibilities, paths in the narrative, and defines the 

freedom of the user, according to the main objective. The aim is to provide a moment 

of discovery and excitement to user, informing and stimulating reflection / action. 

• Author-Text: author balances the control and discovery that is available to users 

(such possible paths to explore) 

• User-Text: an attempt to balance the degree of fun and difficulty associated with the 

user, neither very fun nor very difficult, articulating different media and content 

(narrative, gaming, exploratory, participatory)

Table 3 - Adaptation in author´s perspective 

Although interactivity is inherent to the whole process in this study, one important 

reference to the narrative design in the developed prototype is a point of view from Nelson 

Zagalo who defends “linearity for the construction of new virtual reality entertainment 

artifacts. Linearity that should not be viewed in a simplistic way, but rather as an enhancer 

element an argument with more robust results, namely, in terms of gratification for its users.”

(Zagalo, 2009, p. 367). In the preface of that work, written by Anthony Barker, can be read: 

“Evidence supports the suggestion that narrative receptors respond positively to previously 

defined endings. Open endings can be a threat to the human desire to see their expectations 

concretized.” (Zagalo, 2009, p. 9). Despite the difference in the scope of that work, with 

focus on traditional narrative cinema and its convergence with videogames, it seems 

pertinent, to the author, to consider the fact that traditional narrative cinema is one artifact 

with greater capacity of emotional involvement, and being the documentary a 

cinematographic genre it is interesting to explore that vision for the exploratory purposes of 

this current research. That´s the reason why the prototype is designed with the proposed 

linearity, that is, the challenge to users is to discover and reflect about their “plant blindness 

score” after experiencing the i-doc, and the contents of the site to be tested must be observed 

in a specific order to facilitate the understanding of prototype, in the evaluation-test phase, 

which is: storytelling – botanical games – proof of concept. 

In summary, the main tasks at this stage resulted from the intersection between: 

exploring technology – validating the direction – communicating the vision, being the 

Google´s Methodology, in this reference18, a great help. The next image 3 sums up the 

technique based on UX (user experience):

3.2 Work Package 3 – Analysis 

At this phase, author is part of the process in a self-iterative process, practitioner-

based, self-reflective and improvement focused. Basically, it starts with the demo-production, 

that is not random but a result of experience, observation and theoretical framework, and 

then check if it works, involving the target audience at the earliest possible stage.

Considering the good practices indicated by Ramona Pringle, the analysis of demo-

production considers the following aspects (Aston et al., 2017, pp. 154-169): 

• Test in the initial phase: identify the basic components of the history that constitute 

the system to test 

• Perform the iterative process by unit and identify tools to test 

• Identify key partners and stakeholders in the process 

• Less is more: be careful about "cognitive noise", that is, with an overdose of 

interactivity 

The three-dimensional methodology in the evaluation of user experience, proposed 

by Gantier &amp;amp; Labor, is also considered to evaluate the interface produced, both in terms of 

information architecture and interaction design (Aston et al., 2017: 105): 

• Viewing frame 

• Usability 

• Sense-making processes 

These three dimensions are interdependent on a whole and the approach is applied 

in iterative loops. The ten heuristics of Nielsen (Nielsen, 2017) are also considered in the 

evaluation of the usability of the digital prototype. The proof of concept of this project, 

before any implementation, is carried out, trying to ensure: 

• Quality: to test usability and suitability among target audiences and take steps to 

improve 

• Acceptance: If the pilot has positive results it will be easier to get help from partners 

and even funding to scale the idea 

• Focus: in a more effective and efficient use 

• Knowledge: try to reduce risks and prepare the implementation of the idea with 

solidity 

In a systematic review of the literature on the evaluation of the usability of products 

and services, it was found that this is an area of great interest and there is a growing need for 

a normalization of terminologies, since in many studies the term usability is used in an 

inconsistent way (A. I. Martins, Queirós, Rocha, &amp;amp; Santos, 2013). These authors found that 

inquiry was the most commonly used method, although the combination of methods is 

frequent, especially inquiry and test combination, which allows the collection of qualitative 

and quantitative information, in a more complete assessment. 



 

33 

 

In the same study, the authors point out the orientation of organizations to usability very 

focused on technology, with specific approaches in technical and procedural terms. "The 

user experience goes beyond the efficiency, quality of tasks and user satisfaction, considering 

the cognitive, affective, social and physical aspects of the interaction. In this perspective, the 

user experience contextualizes usability" (A. I. Martins et al., 2013, p. 32).  Thus, with this 

study as a reference, the usability evaluation model used in this project is empirical, since it 

uses data collected with real users, in 2 classrooms, and the used methods and respective 

techniques are: 

• Test: participant observation 

• Inquiry: to produce two questionnaires, using Likert scale (1 - strongly disagree; 5 – 

strongly agree), one general and the other, the System Usability Scale (SUS), based in 

this reference19, and two semi-structured interviews, with the respective teachers of 

the two classes involved (annex VII) 

• Outline a Focus Group: with focus on the problem - plant blindness - is proposed 

to each group draw an “exploratory tree”, with problems (the possible causes of this 

problem) and solutions (paths or ways that can minimize the problem), the problems 

being the roots and the solutions branches of the tree, where the trunk is the plant 

blindness. It was delivered to each user 2 post-its of different colors, one to write the 

problem and another for the solution, and in the end all the post-it were collected to 

analyze the architected tree, based on the approach model presented in the first guide 

published in Portugal for social entrepreneurs (Santos, Salvado, &amp;amp; de Carvalho, 2013)  

(annex VIII) 

After this process, the author shared the contents with some colleagues, that are 

studying fields as Science Communication, Immersive Journalism and New Media, trying to 

obtain clues and opinions about this approach, to find points of view and can improve the 

project. Interactive documentary productions have mostly established interaction with 

audiences in a disclosure posture. What can be a distinction is to establish interaction with 

audiences in a custom dialogic form, where users are an inherent part of the process, in a 

production focused on UX Design. Power should not be centralized in a single part and, in 

this sense, interactive documentary can be used as a scientific communication tool that allows 

mapping possible paths, while introducing adaptations. In this project, the interactive

documentary is interpreted as a communicative, knowledge-building entity, and not only as 

a format or a channel. Articulating storytelling and gaming, using multimodality, it has the 

mission of increasing environmental awareness (focusing on botany), reflection / action in 

an innovative and optimistic problem-solving approach, not forgetting that: 

• Getting success involves "suffering", imperfections and improvements, a lot of 

thinking and it takes time 

• Never forgetting the goal, the vital story, regardless of formats, content, launching 

platforms, considering the adaptation. Using a format or platform just because they 

are appealing can be a mistake, especially if we do not adapt the content 

• Working in a laboratory is useful, but when we look at reality we may encounter bugs 

that were not expected. One important insight is to act in a real context, even with 

the associated limitations 

• What is very logical for the architect of the communicative process may not be so 

explicit to the user, and he is an active part in the process 

 

In the next chapter are presented the results obtained in proof of concept which are 

complemented later, in the discussion chapter, with reflections that aim to promote the 

process´s improvement.

4.1 Evaluation in Natural Context 

In both classrooms, secondary school - 11º level and university level - master´s 

degree, PoC is conducted in two phases: first, observing the initial prototype on the site built 

for that purpose, and a second exploratory phase, in which students are challenged to look 

for causes of Plant Blindness problem and possible solutions or improvements that may 

minimize this problem. The viability of the idea is tested and if the results are optimistic, that 

is, if it is confirmed that the proposal adds value and utility, in the education context and 

promoting a public awareness of the issue, is considered a future implementation of a 

functional prototype, based on the main results obtained. A small introduction is made, about 

what is being developed and point the fact that no one is being evaluated, that the 

contributions are anonymous and the only evaluation to be carried out is only in relation to 

digital object proposed and the possible impact, in science education and its communication. 

In the beginning, is explained that: 

• Participants can interact with the moderator, asking questions and doubts 

• Each participant observes the prototype in its place, but the moderator shares the 

contents simultaneously for the class, explaining the purpose of each interface and 

associated dynamics, reinforcing the functionality of the proposed object 

In both classrooms, the observation of the contents follows the proposed order: 

storytelling – botanical games – prototype observation and the respective teachers were 

present.  

Below are two tables, table 3 and table 4, with complementary information, which 

represent the typology of the two classes involved in this process and the respective 

characteristics as: date of occurrence, number of students involved, classroom typology and 

duration of the event. Following, it is explained how the semi-structured interview is 

conducted to the respective teacher, in each class.

 11º degree in Biology and Geology 

Azambuja Secondary School 

Date 7 March 2018 

Number of Students 17 students 

Classroom typology Informatic classroom with available 12 computers for 

most students (11 students in a computer and three groups, 

each with 2 students, sharing one computer) 

Duration  1h30: starts at 8h30 a.m. until 10h00 a.m. 

Table 4 - Typology of secondary classroom 

Before sharing the prototype, the author asked the class to identify the oldest 

botanical garden in Portugal. It was verified that the group did not know the Ajuda botanical 

garden, but some mentioned the botanic garden from MUNHAC – Museums of the 

University of Lisbon20. The observation of the contents happened without problem, early in 

the morning the access to the Internet was optimal the students could observe and try the 

contents proposed, in the indicated order. Afterwards, they were asked to respond to the 2 

questionnaires available in the respective 2 links of the site (the general questionnaire and the 

SUS questionnaire). After this procedure, the class took an interval of about 10 minutes. 

After the break, the second session was held where the exploratory tree design was proposed. 

Each student received 2 post-it of different color to write, according to their vision, a possible 

cause and respective solution in relation to the Blindness Botany problem. 

During the first session, in the observation of the prototype, the author observed in 

the students an enthusiasm related to the botanical games, an enthusiasm also verified by the 

teacher of the class who commented this detail with her and that will be more detailed in the 

discussion section. 

Before and after the evaluation-test phase with this classroom, the author talked 

informally with the teacher about the main idea associated with the project, and later, in the

same day, sent him a semi-structured interview, being the results shared in the result´s 

interviews section. 

 Master in New Media and Journalism 

FCSH - New University of Lisbon 

Date 8 March 2018 

Number of Students 33 students 

Classroom typology Auditorium 3 of FCSH – NOVA, without computers 

available, students use their smartphones or laptops 

Duration  1h00: starts at 06h00 p.m. until 07h00 p.m. 

Table 5 - Typology of master’s classroom 

In this group it was also verified that the students did not know about the oldest 

botanical garden in Portugal, some of them also referred the botanic garden from 

MUHNAC. The process was similar in methodology, although some differences as: 

• The students were not all present at the beginning of the class, despite most were in 

the room after the introduction and the author reinforced the purpose of the session 

during the process 

• The room was an auditorium, with no computers available and therefore students 

observed the contents on their smartphones or laptops, with the limitations of 

Internet access that occurred during the event. In any case, the author projected the 

contents to the class and explained the associated proposals, with text, images and 

sounds 

• Session duration was shorter and without interval 

• Related to the first group, the class was not so homogeneous in terms of age and 

academic background, formed by students with varied training such as journalism, 

medicine, new media 

At the end of this test phase was the interval, and the class continued later with the 

respective teacher. The author combined with the teacher that the semi-structured interview 

would be sent via email.

4.2 Results  

Considering the research questions (RQ) associated with this project, results are 

shared in one order. First, are summarized the main results obtained in the pilot 

questionnaire about botanical gardens in Portugal. Then, the results achieved with the 

observation of the prototype and the answers of the two questionnaires, which are mostly 

related with RQ1 and RQ3, are shared. Finally, the results obtained in Focus Group 

classrooms and in the semi-structured interviews with respective teachers are disclosed, more 

related to RQ2 and RQ4. 

 

4.2.1 Results obtained in the pilot questionnaire about botanical 

gardens in Portugal 

Were obtained 293 results and only 73 persons correctly answered the question: 

“What is the name of the first botanical garden in Portugal?”. Responses like “Lisbon 

botanical garden” were not considered correct because in Lisbon there are three different 

botanical gardens. Answers like “Ajuda”, “Royal botanical garden” and “Ajuda sidewalk 

garden” were considered correct. 78,8% of the participants have a higher academic 

qualification, 32.4% with postgraduate and master's degrees and another 32.4% with a 

doctorate, the dominant age group (59,8%) being between the ages of 30 and 59 years (10,6% 

of participants are between 18 and 20 years). Full results can be seen at this link21. 

Only 32,4% of people correctly answered the question relative to the foundation time 

of Ajuda botanical garden (JBA), in the second half of the 18th century. The creation of the 

first botanical garden in Portugal was driven by the combination of scientific knowledge, 

technical know-how and political power, and 36,9% recognized this combination even 

though 36,5% emphasize the scientific knowledge as the main cause. 

47% knew the city where JBA was founded (Lisbon), although 30,4% answered that 

they didn´t know and 21,8% responded that it was in Coimbra. In relation to the European 

country, officially considered the place where the first botanical gardens were established 

(Italy), 18,4% knew it. The frank majority, 92,5%, recognize botanical gardens as scientific 

museums but 52,9% don´t have the habit of visiting them. 74,8% considered that botanical 

gardens have an important role to play in the promotion of cultural and leisure activities for 

citizens. In relation to the frequency with which they visit the botanical gardens in Portugal,

for cultural and leisure activities, 49.1% of participants said that they rarely visit, 33.1% 

occasionally, 13% never visit, and only 4,8% visit frequently, at least once monthly.  

 

4.2.2 Results achieved with the observation of the prototype and 

responses to the general and SUS questionnaires, in both groups 

Group 1: 11-year class in Biology and Geology 

• Answers regarding the general questionnaire 

Of the total of 17 students who observed the prototype, 5 girls and 9 boys, 14 

answered the online questionnaire, available at this link22. The participants' ages ranged from 

15 to 18 years (15 - 14.3%, 16 - 42.9%, 17 - 28.6% and 18 - 14.3%). Of these, 71.4% consider 

themselves receptive to the use of new technologies and 85.7% usually play videogames. Of 

the 5 girls who responded, 4 are receptive to new technologies and 3 play videogames. 

Related to audiovisual contents, the three categories most searched online, are: music 

(85.7%), entertainment like games and movies (78.6%) and social networks (42.9%). 

Participants answered that they had already seen interactive documentaries on the Internet 

(71.4%), 360 videos (78.6%), virtual reality (VR) content (64.3%), augmented reality (AR) 

content (50%) and 35.7% said they had never observed content in RV an RA. 

Concerning the question - Did you like the experience? - 71.4% indicated the 

maximum value in the Likert scale, 5, and 28.6% indicated the value 4. Most strongly agreed 

(64.3% scored the maximum value - 35.7% indicated the value 4) that they would like to do 

other experiences of this kind in classes, in this and other disciplines, emphasizing the 

premise that supplementing classes with interactive audiovisual content (videos 360º, RV, 

RA) will be stimulating and motivating for learning (78.6% for the maximum value of the 

scale and 21.4% to the value 4). The mayor agreed on the question, if they would like to 

experiment with their class and the teacher the production of an interactive documentary on 

a subject related to the contents of the discipline Biology and Geology (77.1% answered the 

maximum value of the scale, 28.6% the value 4 and 14.3% indicated the value 3). 

Of the total of 14 participants, 57.1%, 8 students strongly agreed that, in addition to 

students, they are citizens and can participate in an active, autonomous and responsible way

in building better opportunities, in school and in society, being the lowest value of the scale 

given by one student, the value 3. 

Regarding one of the key questions of the questionnaire, the results can be seen 

below, in the graphic 1: 

 

Graphic 1 – Answers from 14 students about the recognition of JBA 

A related question indicated the following statement: "The observation of the prototype 

contributed to a greater involvement with the theme of the Botanical Gardens and their 

importance", obtained similar results: 8 students agreed completely, 5 students agreed (value 

4) and 1 indicated the value 3. Finally, the statement: "I believe that this format will be an 

added value to develop innovative content that complements the classes of botany and 

associated sciences, facilitating the understanding of the curricular contents. " the majority 

strongly agreed (10 students), 3 students assigned the value 4 and 1 the value 3. 

• Answers regarding the SUS questionnaire 

Of the total of 17 students, 11 answered the SUS questionnaire, also online23. Participants 

ranked each question from 1 to 5 based on how much they agreed with the ten statements, 

where 5 means they agreed completely, 1 means they disagreed completely. And then, for 

each of the odd numbered questions, was subtracted 1 from the score, and for each of the 

even numbered questions, was subtracted their value from 5. Then, those new values found, 

were added up to a total value, that was then multiplied by 2.5 and calculated the average

SUS.  Although the calculations were performed manually by the author, to facilitate the 

presentation of the results, a spreadsheet was used in this source24, and the respective results 

were confirmed. 

The result - 73.9 - being not one percentage, gives an estimative about the usability 

of the proposed object. One reference value is 68, but in the discussion section is more 

detailed the SUS score. The results of these calculations can be seen in the table 5, below: 

Table 6 – Results of SUS questionnaire in 11-year class 

Group 2: Master´s Class in Journalism and New Media 

• Answers regarding the general questionnaire 

Of the 33 students present in the room during the questionnaire completion phase, 

23 answered this questionnaire, online25, the largest group from the 20 to 25 age group 

(78.3%) and the female gender (73.9%). Of the 23 respondents, 15 participants considered 

relevant the concept that was tested in their class, 6 answered in the middle of the scale (value 

3) and 2 students disagreed (value 2). 87% of participants already seen the interactive 

documentary genre on the internet, and the clear majority never produced such content 

(95.7%). In relation to the habit of playing videogames only 21.7% confirmed this reality. Of 

the 17 women who responded, 14 do not have this habit, and of the six male participants, 

four do not have this habit either. 

82.6% of the participants considered the inclusion of interactivity in audiovisual 

content to be advantageous, and the majority had viewed 360 videos (91.3%). Regarding the 

observation of VR and RA contents, 69.6% and 47.8% of the participants had already 

observed, respectively, and 17.4% never observed these contents.

The results about design, in the proposal context, can be seen in graphic 2: 

 

Graphic 2 - Answers from 23 students about the importance of design 

. Regarding the statement: "This approach is interesting, given the challenges and 

opportunities that journalism and its teaching are experiencing today.", 5 students agreed 

strongly, 9 agreed (value 4), 6 had a neutral opinion (value 3 of the scale) and 3 disagreed 

(value 2). In the context of the project, 17 students fully agreed that the exploitation of 

interactive documentary will be an asset to develop innovative content that promotes 

differentiating and multidisciplinary journalism, 5 students expressed a neutral opinion (value 

3) and 1 student disagreed (value 2).  

In the context of Media Education, 82.6% of participants agreed that digital media, 

as well as pedagogical resources, are objects of study that allow us to understand and 

interrogate the ways of constructing meaning that they originate, no one disagreed. 17 

students agreed, 6 completely, that the concept tested, in the scope of journalism, promotes 

citizenship as an important motor in the maintenance and recovery of the memories that are 

part of our history and culture, 5 with a neutral answer (value 3) and 1 student disagreed 

(value 2). With some differences, in relation to the importance of the responsibility of 

Journalism in Environmental Education and in the associated problems, the answers were 

close to the previous question: 18 agreed, 9 completely, 4 with a neutral answer (value 3) and 

1 students disagreed 2). Only 1 of the 23 participants reported that have produced an 

interactive documentary, and the answers to the question: "What would be the best way to 

produce a hybrid interactive documentary, based on the prototype that was tested?", were: 5

• Answers regarding the SUS questionnaire 

The procedure associated with this SUS questionnaire, was the same as indicated for 

group 1, and of the 33 students present in the room, 20 answered this questionnaire, online26. 

Table 6, below, shows the values obtained for each participant in the 10 questions involved, 

and the average value of the SUS score obtained – 62.8.

4.2.3 Results obtained in the semi-structured interviews with respective 

teachers 

• Interview with 11-year classroom teacher: 

Edmundo Martins, teacher of Biology and Geology of the 11-year class, said that this 

activity help him to know JBA and the potential of using it to complement his classes, 

because he was unaware of this institution and its pedagogical potentialities, although he had 

already done some classes at the botanical garden of MUHNAC. He considered the approach 

of this project interesting, emphasizing the virtual contents as a complement of great utility, 

before, during and after physical visits. Considering “plant blindness” as a problem, 

Edmundo Martins said: “In fact, we suffer several blindness including plant blindness, the 

knowledge transmitted in the school are a little encyclopedic, very turned to histology and 

plant physiology, with many names to decorate and very little turned to the observation, 

discovery and effective knowledge of flora that surrounds us. Many students do not know,

for example, the flower - fruit relationship and could learn more by observing and simulating 

everyday phenomena.” 

Edmundo Martins often uses audiovisual contents in his classes, considers the image 

very necessary, being the written supports a complement. In relation to traditional 

audiovisual media, he thinks they are not sufficient interactive but to implement more 

interactivity in classrooms there are some limitations in technological resources that can limit 

these approach, as availability and speed of the internet and appropriate classroom conditions 

for this purpose. 

He considered relevant the concept that has been tested. Confirmed that the use of 

the proposal can add value to his activity as a teacher, without losing scientific rigor. It can 

motivate one future visit to Ajuda botanical garden and the i-doc´s utilization can be useful 

during one visit or help to consolidate the concepts in the post-visit and even, allows 

autonomous research paths. 

Regarding the questions below, Edmundo Martins replied: 

- In your opinion, can this strategy contribute to a greater involvement of students 

in botany and related sciences? Edmundo Martins: “Yes, in general as a strategy and 

particularly with disaffected students, with little interest, as can be verified during the session, 

in which generally uninterested students were enthusiastic about the games.” 

- In your view, could the i-doc format be of greater use to individual or collective 

students? Do you have any suggestions? Edmundo Martins: “As an autonomous learning 

path more individually, it can be used in teacher-directed research activities at the collective 

level.” 

- Is the choice of the support to be used to communicate science conditioned by the 

complexity of the subject matter and by the degree of knowledge and information demand 

of the public (considering mediation between text and audiovisual)? Edmundo Martins: 

“Depending on the characteristics of the subject, the most adequate resources are used to 

acquire content and the existing means. In the case of a botanical garden where a transversal 

approach to the different cycles is possible, the learning pathways must be adapted to the 

different levels of education.” 

 - In your opinion, are marked differences between the audiovisual narrative and the 

scientific narrative that condition the transposition process? Edmundo Martins: “No, they 



 

46 

 

are partners, both the audiovisual and scientific narratives are facilitators of learning and 

source of motivation.” 

Edmundo considers interesting the future promotion of this concept among students 

and teachers, creating conditions in the school to produce new experiences in an autonomous 

way, promoting education for the media and enriching school contents. But it would be very 

important to have more adequate rooms and to have one intermediary in the process, that 

facilitates the process. One specialized agent who could produce personalized contents, 

articulating the content to be taught with teachers. It could facilitate because it is difficult for 

teachers to monitor technological development and there is a lack of training in that field. 

Multimedia students could be involved in the process (multimedia teachers and other 

professionals could be partners in content development). 

• Interview with master´s classroom teacher: 

António Granado, teacher of master´s class, answered similar questions to those put 

to the teacher of group 1, focusing Science Communication and Journalism. Below are three 

questions, the same put to Edmundo, with the respective answers and then some 

considerations that he pointed out about the proposal of this project: 

- In your opinion, can this strategy contribute to a greater involvement of students 

in botany and related sciences? – António Granado: “There is no doubt that the observation 

of the prototype can contribute to the students' involvement with the JBA and Botany. I 

think the idea will be more interesting from the point of view of education than from the 

point of view of the journalist, just observing the prototype. The project will be useful to 

produce news about it, but is not possible to do a story or news about the JBA without going 

there in person. It will be interesting if the journalist goes to the garden space and then, 

himself develops the contents. As for the greater involvement of students I have no doubt, 

now for the journalist to observe this format, I have doubts, he can report this event, but as 

a producer, will always be limited to what was filmed, photographed, he only sees what 

someone has already created. But, if he applies this model, that approach contributes to the 

journalist being able to breathe life into his voice in a different way, and in this perspective, 

the proposed i-doc will be interesting for the journalist. “ 

- Is the choice of the support to be used to communicate science conditioned by the 

complexity of the subject matter and by the degree of knowledge and information demand 

of the public (considering mediation between text and audiovisual)? António Granado: “In 

Science Communication is crucial adapting the message to the support that we use. For each 



 

47 

 

medium the speech must be adapted. Some concepts and ideas may work best for text or 

video, for example. Even orally, we must adapt our speech to the number of listeners or to 

the space where we are. People are very accustomed to communicating by text and there is 

difficulty in transposing to the audiovisual media, but it depends on the message to be 

transmitted, the text can even complicate when used in excess, which still happens frequently 

in some presentations. The process of scientific communication should be a process of 

simplifying information, appropriate to the target audience, and simplifying does not mean 

loss of rigor.” 

 - In your opinion, are marked differences between the audiovisual narrative and the 

scientific narrative that condition the transposition process? António Granado: “To 

communicate, as the origin of the word indicates, is to put something in common, and I 

think that in this sense it is possible to simplify. To talk about more complex botanical 

concepts with doctorates, for example in nuclear physics or law, we should simplify. It will 

not be a matter of academic degree, but language can and should be simplified. Accuracy is 

very important, and in the communicative process this detail, and the ability to achieve it, are 

transversal and vital in all areas, and I think simplification is compatible with rigor. We can 

remember Stephen Hawking, in this context.” 

In relation to the idea that one i-doc can be interpreted as a builder and enabler of 

knowledge, António Granado said that when we produce any journalistic product, whether 

in text or images, there is always a construction of knowledge, being that fact the interest of 

journalism, helping to take certain themes to the society. Mixing various contents in one i-

doc, such as games for example, and stimulating interaction with them, can facilitate the 

interplay of the message and the application of knowledge, more easily than just reading a 

story. There is a difference between reading and applying knowledge, and he believes that 

this format might enhance that application and enable the diffusion of knowledge. 

António Granado also pointed out limitations associated with the project´s concept: 

“The time required and associated costs are limiting. There is no time to think about new 

formats. Journalism has been a repetition of information from someone who has already 

produced, and this reality limits the production of that format. Clearly, we need new content 

that stimulates people's attention. Currently, in relation to the situation that many newsrooms 

are currently suffering, there is hardly a bet on the production of this format. It would be 

important to do more experiments of this type, some are made, but they are not enough. 

The production of a format with this type of interaction will be a time-consuming process 

and requires appropriate teams, and the newsrooms have been shrinking brutally for many 



 

48 

 

years. There is not enough time or resources for this kind of productions. And another 

important issue for the managers and administrators of social media: "What will be the profit 

with this format? How many clicks and how many people will be interested in this format?". 

Bets are currently experimental. And remembered that: “University is the only place where 

there is time to explore these new formats and there are not profit pressures. Proofs of 

concept can be useful to demonstrate the usefulness in using these formats, but external 

support will always be necessary, considering the financial limitations”.  

About the importance of design to the planning of communicative relations between 

people and emerging digital objects, António Granado said: “Design is not just the shape, 

because without a defined function it will have no use. The projects can be very appealing 

but if they are not suitable for a purpose, respecting the function they propose, they lose 

usefulness. Planning is thus essential. A prototype is not as fluid as a finalized product, but I 

think the simulated multimodality in this project is interesting.” 

4.2.4 Results obtained in Focus Group classrooms 

Each group draw an “exploratory tree”, with problems - the possible causes of plant 

blindness - and solutions - paths or ways that can minimize that problem - the problems 

being the roots and the solutions branches of the tree, where the trunk is the plant blindness. 

The respective trees, tree 1 (11-year classroom) and tree 2 (master´s classroom), can be 

observed below. 

• Tree 1 - 11-year classroom 

The problems and solutions, written by the 17 students in the post-it, were grouped 

together in main themes to facilitate the understanding of the tree. Next to each is a number, 

which reflects the number of students who indicated the problem / solution (some students 

wrote more than one problem or solution in the post-it). It was not considered in the tree, a 

post-it problem of a participant, because what was written did not fit in the subjects referred 

in collective, but is considered the register of that opinion, in relation to a possible problem: 

"You should not interact too much with the technology otherwise you can lose the notion 

of life. ". The “exploratory tree” in this classroom is summarized in the next image 4:

• Tree 2 -  master´s classroom 

In this session, 28 pairs of post-it were gathered, and the great majority, 20, focused 

their vision on the complexity of the theme and on the ability to make it more empathic and 

dynamic. To bet on the communication, formation, dissemination and awareness of this 

theme, for society in general, not only in the school context but for the different age groups, 

was a transversal way to most of the students. Three students specified that this theme is of 

little expression in the media and that a possible way would be to create, in the organs of 

social communication, a fixed and exclusive category on botany, betting on a greater 

dissemination with informative videos, an example given by one of them.  

Another view that stood out from the majority was the lack of training of government 

personnel and ministries in this area and that, one possible way would be that given the 

inherent responsibility and decision-making power, these people should comply with the 

requirement to have training in the environmental area. One participant linked climate 

change to botanical blindness and the general perception that the negative consequences are 

geographically distant, and identified a possible pathway such as identifying the negative 

consequences already present in the local reality in a differentiating way and disseminating 

these contents, adapted to each locality.

Given the size of this group, the number of students who indicated the problems / 

solutions was not indicated, since many of them used different words to represent the same 

problems and solutions, with only 3 students who focused on the specific problem: the lack 

of dissemination of the topic in the media. The “exploratory tree” in this classroom is 

summarized in the next image 5:

5. Discussion and Improvements 

Discussion is developed regarding the original empirical contribution derived from 

results. According to this scenario, the research questions (RQ) are answered by the author's 

interpretation and proposals for improvement are addressed. An analysis grid is presented 

with the strengths and points to be improved in upcoming actions. The concepts of 

interactivity, immersiveness and participation are framed within this work and the 

transdisciplinary associated with design is strengthened. 

From the results obtained in the pilot questionnaire on botanical gardens in Portugal, 

the author emphasizes the recognition by the participants of the botanical gardens as 

scientific museums and spaces with an important function in the cultural dynamization and 

leisure activities for the citizens. However, they do not manifest a habit of visiting these 

spaces, doing so occasionally and even rarely. In the context of her work, the author believes 

that the botanical gardens, with focus on Ajuda botanical garden (JBA), can improve their 

communication and cultural offer, contributing to their greater recognition and social 

importance. In the results obtained, most participants did not know how to identify the JBA 

as the first Portuguese botanical garden. As this space is a national reference it will be 

pertinent to consider new communicative approaches to increase it social recognition and 

promote actions that try to minimize the problem of botanical blindness. This was a pilot 

questionnaire and the author thinks that it will be interesting to develop new investigations 

in this scope, with greater detail and dimension, that can contribute to a better knowledge of 

this reality, since there is little academic work in this area. 

In general, considering the results obtained in the proof of concept, the author 

considers the results as positive, since most of the answers and considerations obtained in 

the questionnaires, interviews and focus group, validate the concept of this project, in terms 

of interest and practical utility, focusing on the educational context and promoting greater 

environmental awareness. The author also thinks that the results are promoters of a new 

look not only for productive practices and technics, in science communication, but also, and 

specifically, in educational practices, at different academic levels. 

Regarding the interactivity interpretation related to the proposed digital object, the 

author, in addition to using storytelling, sought to create and draw experiences for an 

audience as active as possible, in the sense of: “Interactivity refers to ability of a system to 

partake in the process of interaction. When this refers to communication, a key aspect is the 

fact that the passive viewer or reader of traditional media is replaced by an active user; an 



 

52 

 

entity with agency. The way this agency affects the reception of the work or the work itself 

is widely varied. And while interactivity is intrinsic to digital media, one can argue that not all 

of our experiences with it are really interactive, according to the definition below.” (Soler-

Adillon, 2017, p. 5). The author's view of the participation she made for her target audience 

took into consideration a form of social interaction, according to the same mentioned 

authors, the fact that: “Although some authors conflate it with interactivity, it is very useful 

to differentiate both concepts. While interaction always implies some sort of participation, 

this is a pertinent distinction in order to frame the different types of activities that can take 

place with technological systems that afford that the users take action in relation to them. It 

is especially relevant in the context of the web 2.0 and social media, where user generated 

content is central. The proposal here is to understand participation as contribution: That is, 

the creating content by the user of the system, as a different act than that of interacting with 

this content.” (Soler-Adillon, 2017, p. 5). As for the notion of immersion, it was very useful 

for the author, the contribution of the same authors in pages 5 and 6, when they show the 

differentiation of the spatial / technological immersion of the emotional / psychological 

immersion that can be better understood in this sharing: “(…) it is not so much the tech-

nology but the engagement that generates immersion. Playing a game in a very small screen, 

or a monitor a few meters away can be as immersive as using a Virtual Reality headset, if we 

understand immersion as this psychological loss of awareness of our immediate 

surroundings.”. 

In relation to RQ1 and RQ3, the main annotations developed by the author are 

below: 

• RQ1: Can the proposal for the multimedia hybrid be a valid medium to promote 

awareness for plant blindness and science education?  

• RQ3: Does the observation of the hybrid contribute to inform and alert to the 

importance of botanical gardens, particularly to the recognition of the JBA?  

In both groups of the two different academic levels, a positive affirmation was 

verified to these question, since most of the students involved agreed with the key questions 

included in the two respective questionnaires, confirming that: the observation of the 

prototype helped to get to know the botanical garden of Ajuda and the proposal associated 

with the project may contribute to a greater involvement with Botany and related sciences, 

promoting the importance of botanical gardens in that sense. In the two interviews 



 

53 

 

conducted to the respective teachers, according to the answers obtained and the shared 

considerations, both opinions were favorable to the two research questions above. 

In secondary classroom, the majority confirm that i-doc is a format which adds value 

to develop innovative content, complementing the classes of botany and associated sciences 

and facilitating the understanding of the curricular contents. Everyone enjoyed the 

experience. Most strongly agreed that they would like to do other experiences of this kind in 

classes, in this and other disciplines, emphasizing the premise that supplementing classes 

with interactive audiovisual content (360 videos, RV, RA) will be stimulating and motivating 

for learning. The author views the enthusiasm of the students with some reservations. To 

understand how the format i-doc can promote awareness for plant blindness and science 

education, will be necessary to deepen the study, since is not exempt from controversy. The 

author thinks that there is no doubt that the observation of her prototype contributes to get 

to know Ajuda botanical garden but, to affirm that the proposal can be efficient to improve 

the learning of curricular contents is needed more evidences. Still, there is a resistance 

regarding the use of Gamification, the critics argue that it undermines the focus on study and 

learning and not promote the success that is promised (Orlandi, Duque, Mori, &amp;amp; Orlandi, 

2018). These authors also mention the greater need for research. 

 In the master’s class, where the test was more focused on journalistic activity, was 

recognized that interactive documentary rather than just being a media or digital media 

channel, which represents reality, can be interpreted as a builder and enabler of knowledge 

and could be one valuable tool to develop innovative content that promotes differentiating 

and multidisciplinary journalism. However, the author does not neglect the fact that, from 

the total of 20 participants, 5 students expressed a neutral opinion and 1 student did not 

agree with the use of i-doc in in journalistic differentiation, which indicates that it will be 

important to perceive this reality, in a more detailed way and with better questionnaires. The 

author thinks that, given the greater maturity of the master class, the results show a less 

enthusiasm associated and a more critical look about the proposal, which is revealing the 

need for further research. On the other hand, the author believes that is one evidence that 

the students can be skeptics to new approaches that involve adaptation or reorganization in 

their routines and habits. But it is necessary to investigate in a more targeted way. Efforts 

have been made to journalists attempting to think and act like web designers. Journalism 

students, in general, are used to telling stories in a traditional way (headline, beginning, 

middle, end) and doing it in a different way requires a different planning. It will be imperative 



 

54 

 

to become more engaged with new media design platforms and nowadays, forward-thinking 

educators are beginning to focus on the creation of i-docs (Gyori &amp;amp; Charles, 2017). 

The reference value for the SUS questionnaire is 68, and below this value it is a sign 

that the usability is reduced or that it should be improved (Teixeira, 2015). The SUS obtained 

in the 11-year class is around 74 and in the master’s class it is below 68, obtaining an 

approximate value of 63. This difference of usability in the two classes is interesting to 

analyze. The author considers that evaluating the usability of something that is not yet 

materialized is difficult and subject to error, either by the transmitter of the idea or by the 

receiver and interpreter. As Fabricio Teixeira highlights27, SUS can be applied to test 

products, services, hardware, software, websites and any type of interface.  The tested 

prototype, is a first iteration with the target audience, from the initial idea to its development, 

approximating what is proposed and expected to be performed, and therefore there is an 

associated limitation. That is why was very important to choose to apply different procedures 

throughout the work, trying to find patterns or differences in opinions. The author thinks 

that the fact that masters class did not interact as much with the prototype´s contents as the 

secondary school group did, mainly due to the limitations of Internet access and shorter 

duration of the event, contributed to the difference obtained at the SUS level. In addition, in 

the demonstrative production of the contents, despite the author tried to have a general 

approach, there was a greater focus on the curricular contents of the 11th grade class which 

may have influenced the results. But to clarify these details it would be necessary to move 

forward in the iteration and to materialize a new test phase, more directed and specific to 

each group. And with a better prototyping, more functional. 

In any case, the author considers the SUS results encouraging, indicating that the 

overall purpose has been achieved, at this initial phase, although improvements must be 

made in future. The results obtained are valid in the context in which they were obtained and 

given the reduced sample involved, they cannot be generalized. The author considers that it 

will be of extreme importance to replicate new studies with this approach, with structured 

and transdisciplinary teams, and it is necessary to deepen the theme in a systematic study to 

obtain more specific results.  

In relation to RQ2 and RQ4, the main annotations developed by the author are:

• RQ2: What added value and constraints are created with multimedia hybrid format 

when addressing plant blindness, in the context of this project? 

Considering one constraint that was pointed out from one student, in 11-year 

classroom - that we should not interact too much with the technology otherwise we can lose 

the notion of life – the author wants to highlight that the main purpose of this study is to 

research how technology can be a valuable medium to establish connections between online 

and offline world, that is, considers the use of technology as a facilitator of a responsible 

dialogue and promoter of a greater social awareness about the importance of Botany as a 

socio-economic and environmental resource, which cannot be underestimated. As Jane 

McGonigal remembers in the conclusions of her book “Reality is Broken – Why Games 

Make Us Better and How They Can Change the World” the primary functions of games are: 

“to provide real positive emotions, real positive experiences, and real social connections 

during a difficult time.”  And so, the author think is possible, with all the involved socio-

technological challenges, to promote that dynamic in education context. 

In a medium as plural as the Internet, there are also more and more threats to 

credible, reliable communication. Anyone can produce and disseminate content in this 

ecosystem. The author argues, in this sense, the need to create conditions and ensure 

technical and human resources that can ensure a normalization, in the future even be able to 

certification, in the use and dissemination of the i-doc format in science communication. In 

the Portuguese case, there is a manual of good design practices for journalism applied in 

webdocumentary28, which resulted from a master's work (A. d. L. C. da Rocha, 2017), and is 

a relevant contribution from the perspective of the author, stimulating reflections and new 

actions in this field.  

Other constraints were annoted in the interviews with the respective professors, like 

the need for more adequate classrooms, better equipped and with better access to the 

Internet, and on the other hand, the lack of time and the weak specific training of teachers 

in this field. António Granado concerned the time required and associated costs associated 

to one project like this work. Pointed out the fact that external financial support will always 

be necessary to implement it. 

In relation to the value added by the proposal associated with this project, the author 

recalls the two drawn trees, obtained in the focus group of the two groups, and considers

them the highest value that she can discern in this phase of the project: the voice of her target 

audience. The author considers that the results in both questionnaires and interviews 

reinforce the premises that were the founding roots of the objectives outlined in this project. 

And, in this perspective, despite the associated limitations, the author considers that the 

action-research was aggregator and opened horizons for other studies.  

The author argue that the concept of the project can be useful for science education 

and communication, being necessary to adapt to a target audience and specific objectives. 

Multimedia objects may facilitate the understanding of complex problems as they offer 

different information that can be used in layers, according to the needs and choices of users. 

Users that are active agents in the communicative process. One constraint that appears with 

non-linear narratives is in relation to the issue of authorship, but that detail is not relevant in 

this work, because the author defined since the beginning the possibilities of interaction and 

participation for her users.  

The author also thinks that it will be interesting to explore the i-doc within the 

framework of institutional scientific communication, in a creative way that can stimulate 

public interest. 

• RQ4: What are the main causes of “plant blindness” and which effects it can cause, 

particularly in the regular teaching of botany and associated sciences? 

The students not only identify causes of the plant blindness problem, but also 

indicated possible ways of minimizing it. In two different events and with participants with 

demarcated socio-demographic characteristics, causes and possible solutions were pointed 

out, some converging in both groups. The lack of investment and appreciation of the subject, 

not only financially but also in terms of human resources, was common to both groups. The 

fact that it is a complex problem and does not have solutions that are easy to reach in the 

short term is another problem that the author underlines in the results. The need for greater 

dissemination of issues associated with botany and its importance in economic and social 

terms has been emphasized, as well as greater emphasis on training, not only in academic 

settings. In the context of the 11-year class, the students' willingness to participate in more 

dynamic classes that promote autonomy and greater responsibility was evident, which 

reinforces the author's opinion regarding the need to implement, with greater assiduity and 

continuity, educative practices in inquiry-based approaches, using innovative tools and 

stimulating Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI).

The simplicity or complexity of multimodality used in interactive systems should be 

adapted to the context and objectives. The author believes that simplicity, in some contexts, 

may be even more beneficial, but only by experimenting and testing, in a consistent and 

systematic way, so that we can get to know its potentialities. Isolated and time-separated 

actions will not be productive, in her view, and it is imperative to follow the maturity of the 

market, to monitor technology and its potential, for the well-being of society. 

To refine the prototype, it would be important to perform a heuristic analysis with 

specialists, based on the 10 heuristics of Nielsen, to verify and improve the effectiveness and 

efficiency of the proposed interfaces and dynamics. 

In the feedback that the author received from several colleagues with whom she 

shared her prototype, many were the opinions and suggestions. The choice of platforms to 

develop was one of the key factors, as it greatly influences the software to be used so that it 

is possible to express the dynamics proposed in the various interfaces. The limitation 

associated with the functionalities of the chosen platforms was another point, especially the 

free versions. The improvement of a more functional prototype was another tip to consider, 

an also the refinement of questionnaires. Attention to the quality and design of sound is 

another vital factor in defining such a project. 

The author applied her knowledge, had to make several decisions during the process 

and this approach reinforced her skills. There are no perfect formulas and the ideas to be 



 

58 

 

implemented should go step by step, in an iterative process. The implementation of an idea 

is always a difficult phase, but not impossible. A very useful feedback and that the author 

was very pleased to receive from her colleague José Maia, because it was an indicator that he 

understood the concept of this project, was this sharing: “I read your project, I think it is 

ambitious without doubt, but I remind you that the timing for a project of a master's degree 

is very short. Thus, a project of this size should be implemented in phases, addressed as a 

pizza, primarily the basis, solid and functional, and then, gradually, the ingredients.”. 

“There is a lack of a global and transdisciplinary understanding of design in order for 

Bonsieppe's (1992) omen to become reality: design as the fundamental new discipline of the 

21st century, replacing mathematics with the transdisciplinary and foundational role it has 

had in science since the 17th century” (da Silva Vieira, 2018, p. 102).

 Future Work 

The author considers, according to research developed by several authors referred 

throughout this work, that the results of her work are consistent with the lines of action, 

premises and arguments presented in the theoretical section. There are no static formulas, 

and the interactive documentary format, alone, will not work miracles, but, without 

experimentation, without auscultation, we will not have results that can reinforce, or refute, 

the premises and arguments associated with this communication proposal. To stimulate 

autonomy, critic thinking and ability to realize ideas and projects, it is necessary to give 

conditions and invest, and nowadays both in the education sector and journalism sector, the 

time factor is a valuable resource, beyond the limitations, not only financial, that persist in 

the two areas of activity. 

In education, timetables, curriculum contents and objectives of students and teachers 

are often not consistent with the changes that are desired. How will it be possible to introduce 

new dynamics, enhancing improvements, if many schools and their players still find it 

difficult to meet the current objectives? In Portugal, curricular flexibilization is a path that is 

being introduced to schools and it will be interesting to explore this option in the context of 

this project, in future studies that the author hopes be able to develop. These two references29 

reinforce the author´s perspective about the importance of storytelling in education. One 

another consideration that the author wants to point is the National Cinema Plan (Plano 

Nacional de Cinema)30 which have, in the author´s perspective, convergent objectives with 

her line of action associated to this project. The future of Education and Skills project31 and 

the Portuguese project "A Voz dos Alunos"32 launched in November 2016, are realities that 

the author considered in her research design. 

In journalism, maximizing profit is another limiting factor when thinking about new 

forms of expression and communication. Journalistic contents that exploit interactivity and 

multimodality by adding gameplay characteristics are still scarce, and so is one important field 

to explore, studying and creating links between theory and practice that can add value do this 

professional activity. The university can play a crucial role in establishing links between the 

academic community and society, particularly with the journalistic industry. Exploring new

means of financing, in addition to advertising, according to the author is a way to consider, 

which can create conditions for more detailed studies and prove the viability and 

sustainability of these new emerging formats. If we do not change the status quo, we will 

hardly leave this "monotonous wheel" in which models of communication are repeated. Civil 

society can be involved in this process, being encouraged to express ideas and the issues that 

are considered urgent to clarify and communicate, in a more effective way. This project 

focused its attention on the school community because it considers that it is extremely 

important to stimulate the critical sense and the responsibility of the students, the sooner the 

better. The challenges are immense, digital literacy and media literacy are not immediate 

solutions, they can even bring more challenges as Danah Boyd33 alerts: “If we’re not careful, 

“media literacy” and “critical thinking” will simply be deployed as an assertion of authority 

over epistemology “. In this scenario, the author reaffirms the need to explore and better 

understand different ways of building knowledge.  Although she is not a journalist, she 

considers, given her academic background and professional activity, that she can be 

integrated into a multi and transdisciplinary team, and can act in a convergent and more 

effective way, within the framework proposed in this work. 

Partnering, crowdfunding or applying for European funds are alternatives to consider 

in the short term, that can accelerate the establishment of this project. Interactive 

documentary can improve awareness about social issues, there is a lack of use of this specific 

format in science communication and is needed further investigation about that approach, 

to connect people to identity, memory and places and promote plural perspectives about one 

specific subject (Casella, 2018). 

The author feels motivated with the development of this work that considers to be a 

structuring phase in her academic formation, concretely in Science Communication. This 

project, in her view, is a stimulus to follow the PhD level, studying and deepening how 

technology and recent advances can contribute to the enrichment of educational practices, 

school success and promotion of a more cohesive and responsible society, with focus on 

human centered design. 

In the absence of an own definition and taxonomy established for the format of the 

interactive documentary, the author thinks that it will be of great utility to study in more 

depth what kind of interactivity that will best adapt to the context of regular education, in 

the ambit of scientific education in Botany and associated sciences. The understanding of

the immersion variable will be another detail to consider, since the author believes that 

depending on the level of interactivity proposed, the associated immersion may have some 

correlation, as well as the success of the participation manifested by users, but at this stage it 

is only a possible line of research to consider. It will be of great importance to create 

conditions for articulating theory and practice in specific actions, that promote greater 

clarification of ambivalent concepts such as interaction, immersion, participation, among 

other. The author believes that the interactivity-immersion-participation triangle may be 

common to any proposed taxonomy, and that the combination of these three variables can 

be an interesting contribution as a basis for analyzing possible combinations in a well-defined 

context and purpose, having as a reference the work developed by (Soler-Adillon, 2017). 

In her meeting with DIFR, in relation to innovative communication proposals for 

Ajuda botanical garden (JBA), two main lines of action were defined. Actions outside JBA: 

to carry out an urban intervention using technology, science and art in unexpected cities 

places, such as squares, subway exits and shopping centers. Several ideas emerged, such as 

creating digital, physical and virtual micro-gardens, producing “live infographics”, such as 

associating the age of a tree with remarkable periods of our national and / or international 

history, providing video mapping shows, using light to map existing plants or created 

virtually. Another idea is to map green routes of the cities promoting challenges to the 

citizens, invited them to explore a certain zone of one city and to realize objectives. Regarding 

actions inside JBA, alternatives such as the production of non-intrusive (transparent) displays 

with sensors were considered and, after interaction of the visitors, some stimuli to be defined 

at the design stage, such as some contact or physical proximity, these displays react with 

different types of information providing experiences beyond oral and written 

communication, as well as aural, haptic and kinetic experiences. 

EUROGARD VIII34 - Eight European Botanic Gardens Congress: “Botanic 

Gardens, People and Plants for a Sustainable World” will occur in Lisbon in May 7th-11th, 

2018. Several themes will be highlighted since there is a huge need to develop and/or adapt 

botanic gardens´ policies and practices. The author hopes her approach in this project may 

contribute for one of the major roles for botanic gardens: Education, and to promote 

awareness about the socio-environmental problems we face today.

ANNEX VII - SCRIPT ABOUT TECHNIQUES USED IN PROOF OF 

CONCEPT 

GUIÃO: técnicas utilizadas na prova de conceito 

O objectivo é testar a viabilidade da ideia, se a proposta em questão acrescenta valor 

e utilidade, antes de qualquer implementação, para minimizar erros e custos desnecessários 

e adaptar com maior sucesso às necessidades dos principais utilizadores. Serão utilizados 

diferentes métodos e técnicas para potenciar a fiabilidade dos resultados (online e 

presencialmente). Em caso afirmativo será considerada a implementação futura de um 

protótipo funcional com base nos principais resultados obtidos no teste do conceito. 

O foco estará na avaliação de usabilidade do protótipo inicial, que será realizada 

através de:  

- Focus Group, Questionários e Entrevistas (semiestruturadas) 

Eficácia – o ideal será que as tarefas propostas sejam realizadas com o mínimo de 

assistência 

Eficiência – o ideal será que as tarefas propostas e os recursos utilizados sejam 

optimizados entre si 

- System Usability Scale (SUS) 

Satisfação – averiguada através do inquérito SUS e Focus Group (verbalizações 

dos participantes) 

- Entrevistas semi-estruturadas 

com os Professores das 2 turmas a realizar a avaliação do protótipo: verificar a 

adequabilidade da ideia a cada contexto e explorar a opinião e sugestões, nomeadamente em 

contexto de ensino de Biologia e Geologia (ao nível do ensino secundário – 11º ano) e em 

contexto de ensino de Jornalismo (ao nível do ensino superior, mestrado) (entrevista será 

diferenciada para cada contexto) 

Alunos - Procedimentos em sala de aula: 

O teste em sala de aula será realizado em duas fases, uma relativa à avaliação do 

protótipo inicial e, uma segunda fase, exploratória, em que se pretende desafiar os alunos a 



 

xv 

 

procurar possíveis soluções de melhoria para a sua aprendizagem e envolvimento com a 

temática Botânica. 

1ª Fase: 

- Início da sessão: realizar uma introdução explicativa do contexto e do propósito 

da acção, reforçando a ideia que o que estará a ser testado e avaliado é a ideia central do 

projecto, manifestada através do protótipo, e não os participantes. (se necessário proceder 

aos procedimentos relativos aos termos de confidencialidade, consentimento informado e de 

responsabilidade, pois durante a sessão poderão ser recolhidos alguns materiais, como 

fotografias). Fazer uma breve introdução ao documentário interactivo e das possibilidades 

associadas, com foco em contexto escolar, muitas ainda por explorar. (tempo estimado: 10 

minutos) 

- Partilhar o site desenvolvido para a prova de conceito e especificar as tarefas 

que deverão ser realizadas com os conteúdos propostos nos respectivos separadores: 

algumas reflexões e questões em aberto sobre a importância da botânica e dos jardins 

botânicos e do seu potencial como espaços de comunicação de ciência, que poderão ser 

explorados em contexto escolar complementando as temáticas em estudo, jogos botânicos, 

e, após essa abordagem observarem e analisarem o protótipo inicial (no guião: doc+ ppt) que 

simula as interfaces e dinâmicas associadas ao planeamento e concepção do documentário 

interactivo proposto. No decorrer da observação: 

- Os participantes podem interagir com o moderador, colocar questões ou pedir ajuda 

- Cada participante estará a observar o protótipo no seu lugar, mas o moderador 

partilhará em simultâneo para a turma e irá explicando o objectivo de cada interface e 

dinâmica associada para reforçar a funcionalidade do sistema proposto e agilizar o processo 

(tempo estimado: 20 minutos) 

 

 

- Realizar de seguida o inquérito SUS, via presencial em folha (tempo estimado: 5 

minutos) 

10 perguntas – resposta na escala de Lykert 1 a 5  

(1- Discordo totalmente, 5- Concordo totalmente) 

Identificação no início (apenas com género e idade)

1. Penso que gostaria de utilizar este sistema nas aulas 

2. Acho o sistema desnecessariamente complexo 

3. Acho o sistema fácil de usar 

4. Penso que precisaria de apoio para utilizar o sistema 

5. Acho que as várias funções do sistema estão bem integradas 

6. Acho que há demasiadas inconsistências no sistema 

7. Penso que a maioria das pessoas aprenderá a utilizar facilmente este 

sistema 

8. Penso que o sistema será incómodo de usar 

9. Penso que será motivante utilizar este sistema 

10. Penso que o esforço para utilizar o sistema será mínimo 

Nas perguntas ímpares retira-se 1 valor ao valor indicado pelo utilizador para obter 

o valor final da resposta, nas perguntas pares o valor da resposta será 5 menos o valor 

indicado pelo utilizador. O resultado final será igual à soma de todas as contribuições das 10 

perguntas multiplicado por 2.5. O valor de referência do SUS é de 68 pontos, abaixo desse 

valor é uma indicação de que a usabilidade do sistema está aquém do esperado. Este valor 

não é uma percentagem, apenas clarifica a facilidade de utilização do sistema em teste.

diferenciador e multidisciplinar (1-discordo totalmente/5-concordo totalmente) 

- No contexto deste projecto, o documentário interactivo mais do que um suporte 

ou canal mediático digital, que representa a realidade, pode ser interpretado como um 

construtor e potenciador de conhecimento (acção epistemológica)? 

- Considera o Design como essencial à planificação das relações comunicativas entre 

as pessoas e os objectos digitais emergentes? (1-discordo totalmente/5-concordo totalmente) 

- Considera importante a responsabilidade do Jornalismo na Educação Ambiental e 

nas problemáticas associadas? (1-discordo totalmente/5-concordo totalmente) 

- O conceito do projecto testado, no âmbito do Jornalismo, promove a cidadania 

como um motor importante na manutenção/recuperação das memórias que fazem parte da 

nossa história e cultura (1-discordo totalmente/5-concordo totalmente) 

- No contexto da Educação para os Media, os media digitais para além de recursos 

pedagógicos são objectos de estudo que permitem compreender e interrogar as formas de 

construção do sentido que originam (1-discordo totalmente/5-concordo totalmente) 

- Já produziu algum documentário interactivo online? Sim/Não 

- Na sua opinião, qual seria a melhor forma de produzir um documentário 

interactivo? Implementação de código puro/Ferramentas online/NS-NR 

Tempo total estimado para a 1ª sessão com alunos: cerca de 45 minutos 

Intervalo 

2ª Fase: Focus Group  

Tempo estimado: cerca de 45 minutos 

Utilizando a teoria “Cegueira Botânica” é pretendido discutir esta temática 

com a turma e explorar a criação de ideias, aplicando o Design Thinking com a 



 

xix 

 

premissa "Design thinking is basically a problem-solving approach to achieve creative 

solutions". 

 

Este pode ser um problema importante, até crítico, quando várias pessoas na 

sociedade são afectadas de um modo muito negativo (vejamos por exemplo o 

problema recorrente dos fogos no nosso país, com diversas causas, entre elas as 

tensões associadas às plantas escolhidas para as diversas áreas florestais e à sua 

manutenção). 

Pode também ser um problema negligenciado, não porque está a ser ignorado 

pela sociedade, porque até existem pessoas que têm actuado no âmbito, mas porque 

ainda não se obtiveram resultados satisfatórios. 

A tentativa de conhecer as causas deste problema pode ser de grande utilidade 

e ter impacto ao nível da percepção de outros problemas associados, o que será de 

grande utilidade. 

Objectivo: Reduzir a Cegueira Botânica 

Como criar valor para a Sociedade? (adaptar ao contexto de cada turma, 

por exemplo na de 11º ano, como criar valor nas aulas sobre botânica? Quais as 

limitações e desafios? Na turma de jornalismo, como desenvolver conteúdos 

inovadores que possam promover uma maior consciência sobre esta problemática? 

Quais as limitações e desafios?) 

O objectivo será desenvolver uma árvore exploratória, com as: 

- possíveis causas associadas ao problema central, para que seja possível 

discernir uma visão mais aguçada desse problema e permitir discutir entre todos uma 

proposta de valor a criar com uma estratégia alternativa. 

- possíveis soluções ou vias, olhando para a base (as causas) e transformando 

em propostas de acção. Neste processo, tendo como um meio alternativo o híbrido 

a testar, será interessante ter abertura para a identificação de outros meios 

identificados nas dinâmicas que possam estar relacionados e ser considerados no 

futuro. Na transformação da árvore dos problemas em árvore de objectivos os 

elementos negativos são transformados positivamente.

Para facilitar o processo, será exemplificado o pretendido com um exemplo prático relativo 

ao problema, será partilhada uma imagem com o início de um exemplo para uma árvore do 

problema relativo à Cegueira Botânica, como indicado abaixo, a ideia é ir ramificando do 

problema central (Cegueira Botânica), para baixo os problemas e para cima as possíveis 

soluções: 

 

 

 

    Soluções???  

 

 Serão disponibilizados post-its de cores diferentes: 

- Para os problemas: post-it vermelhos 

- Para as possíveis soluções: post-it verdes 

Serão distribuídos os post-it para os alunos escreverem as suas ideias e o moderador 

no quadro da sala vai compondo árvores com os post-it recolhidos. 

Guião base para entrevista para o professor turma 11º ano: 

- Esta actividade contribuiu para conhecer o Jardim Botânico da Ajuda e as 

potencialidades na utilização do espaço para complementar as suas aulas? 

- Já desenvolveu alguma aula num jardim botânico ou noutro espaço verde? 

Considera apelativa essa abordagem, física ou virtualmente? 

- Costuma utilizar material multimédia e audiovisual nas suas aulas de 

Biologia/Geologia ou utiliza com maior frequência os suportes escritos?  

Cegueira Botânica

A Botânica pode 
ser 

desinteressante

Temas complexos 
e difíceis de 

entender

A maioria dos 
recursos para 
estudar são à 
base de textos  

Utilizar os meios digitais, promovendo o 

audiovisual e novas tecnologias 

emergentes, como complemento de estudo 

e um facilitador? Documentário 

interactivo? Como? 



 

xxi 

 

- Considera os meios audiovisuais complementos válidos em relação ao suporte 

escrito, concretamente em conteúdos multimédia via Internet, em contexto de sala de aula? 

- Considera relevante a ideia conceito que foi testada? Pensa que será uma mais valia 

para a sua actividade como professor, utilizar a proposta deste projecto, sem perder o rigor 

científico? 

- Na sua opinião, poderá esta estratégia contribuir para um maior envolvimento dos 

alunos com a temática da Botânica e ciências associadas?  

- Na sua visão, o formato i-doc poderá ser de maior utilidade aos alunos a nível 

individual ou colectivo? Tem alguma sugestão nesse sentido? 

- Considera interessante promover este conceito junto dos alunos e professores, 

criando condições na escola para que possam produzir novas experiências de um modo 

autónomo, promovendo a educação para os media e enriquecendo os conteúdos escolares? 

- Ou ter um intermediário nesse processo poderá facilitar, isto é, articulando os 

conteúdos a leccionar com esse agente especializado em tecnologias emergentes, poderão ser 

produzidos conteúdos “por medida” e partilhados com a comunidade escolar? 

Guião base para entrevista para o professor na turma do mestrado em 

Jornalismo: 

- Considera relevante a ideia conceito que foi testada na turma de mestrado em 

Jornalismo?  

- Na sua opinião, qual o valor que pode ser criado com esta proposta ao nível dos 

desafios e oportunidades que o Jornalismo atravessa na actualidade? 

- Poderá esta estratégia, por um lado, contribuir para um maior envolvimento dos 

alunos com a temática da Botânica e ciências associadas e por outro, salientar o papel social 

do Jornalista em Educação Ambiental?  

- No contexto deste projecto, o documentário interactivo mais do que um suporte 

ou canal mediático digital, que representa a realidade, pode ser interpretado como um 

construtor e potenciador de conhecimento (acção epistemológica)? 

- Considera o Design como essencial à planificação das relações comunicativas entre 

as pessoas e os objectos digitais emergentes? 

- Na sua opinião, existem diferenças marcantes entre a narrativa audiovisual e a 

narrativa científica que condicionam o processo de transposição?  



 

xxii 

 

- Será que a escolha do suporte a utilizar para comunicar ciência é condicionada à 

partida pela complexidade da temática e pelo grau de conhecimentos e exigência de 

informação do público (pensando na mediação entre texto e audiovisual)?  

- Considera que esta abordagem será benéfica para a promoção da Educação para os 

Media, na intersecção da comunicação de ciência, do jornalismo e da exploração de novos 

objectos e tecnologias digitais?
