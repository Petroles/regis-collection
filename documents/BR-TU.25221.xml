ABSTRACT 

 

 

PINHEIRO, Hugo Alves, D.S. Federal University of Viçosa, February, 2004. Physiological 
and morphological adaptations as associated with drought tolerance in robusta coffee 
(Coffea canephora Pierre var. kouillou). Major Advisor: Fábio Murilo DaMatta. Advisors: 
Elizabeth Pacheco Batista Fontes and Marcelo Ehlers Loureiro 
 

 

Clones of Coffea canephora Pierre var. kouillou with contrasting tolerance to drought stress 

have been chosen on the basis of their productivities under rainfed conditions. As little is 

known about physiological mechanisms associated with differences in drought tolerance in 

those clones, this work aimed to examine morphological traits, stomatal responses to both soil 

and atmosphere drought, water relations, water-use efficiency (WUE) and, in addition, 

whether drought tolerance in C. canephora may be linked to protection against oxidative 

damage. For these purposes, four clones of C. canephora representing drought-tolerant (14 

and 120) and drought-sensitive (46 and 109A) genotypes were grown under screen house 

conditions, in 120 L pots, during eight months. Drought stress was imposed by withholding 

irrigation until leaf water potential at predawn (?pd) reached about –3.0 MPa. Under full 

irrigation, soil-to-leaf hydraulic conductance (KL), midday leaf water potential and total 

biomass were all greater in clones 109A and 120 than in the other clones. After 14 days 

without irrigation, ?pd decreased significantly in clone 109A in comparison with the other 

clones; seven days latter, ?pd dropped to about –2.3 MPa in clones 46 and 109A, against –0.8 

MPa in clone 14 and –1.7 MPa in clone 120. Clone 109A attained –3.0 MPa at predawn 

earlier, followed by clone 46, clone 120, and then clone 14, in this order. Under drought 

stress, there was no elastic adjustment, while a slight osmotic adjustment was only noted in 

the clone 109A. Stomatal conductance (gs) was strongly decreased with decreasing ?pd; it 

declined modestly with increasing leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficit. Stomatal sensitivity to 

both soil and atmospheric drought was lower in clone 109A and similar among the other 

clones. Drought stress led to a significant increase in carbon isotope composition (?13C) for all 



 2

clones, suggesting an increased WUE; however, absolute values of ?13C were lower in clone 

109A than in the other clones irrespective of the irrigation treatments. Clones 14 and 120 

exhibited deeper root systems than drought-sensitive clones. This at least partially explain 

their better avoidance to drought as compared with the sensitive clones. On average, the larger 

KL in clone 120 than in clone 14 might largely explain why the latter was better able to 

postpone dehydration. For all clones, water potential, gs and KL recovered rapidly following 

re-watering; these facts, associated with the remarkable stomatal sensitivity to drought, should 

explain greatly why C. canephora responds strongly to irrigation. Independently of the clone 

examined, little or no effect of drought on the quantum yield of electron transport, 

photosystem II photochemical efficiency and photochemical and non-photochemical 

quenching coefficients was observed. Comparatively, the clone 120 showed a more tolerant 

photosynthetic apparatus to both drought and paraquat-induced oxidative stress, with no clear 

distinction among the other clones in this regard. Drought triggered increases in superoxide 

dismutase (clones 109A and 120), ascorbate peroxidase (clones 14, 46 and 109A), catalase 

and guaiacol peroxidase (clones 46 and 109A), and glutathione reductase (clone 46). 

Monodehydroascorbate reductase and dehydroascorbate reductase were not induced in 

drought-stressed plants; their maximal activities were much lower than that of ascorbate 

peroxidase, irrespective of the clone investigated. Oxidative damage, however, appeared to be 

evident only in clone 109A. In general, the clones herein investigated were able to preserve, 

or even to increase, their antioxidant defences at water potentials as low as –3.5 MPa. The 

combination of mechanisms that effectively postpone dehydration, associated with deep root 

systems, should contribute to survival and/or stability of crop yield of drought-tolerant clones 

in regions with unpredictable precipitation. Attributes such as osmotic and elastic adjustments 

and protection against oxidative damage induced by drought should be of minor importance to 

drought tolerance in this specie.

EXTRATO 

 

 

PINHEIRO, Hugo Alves, D.S. Universidade Federal de Viçosa, Fevereiro de 2004. 
Adaptações fisiológicas e morfológicas associadas à tolerância à seca em café robusta 
(Coffea canephora Pierre var. kouillou). Orientador: Fábio Murilo DaMatta. Conselheiros: 
Elizabeth Pacheco Batista Fontes e Marcelo Ehlers Loureiro 
 

 

Clones de Coffea canephora Pierre var. kouillou com tolerância diferencial à seca vêm sendo 

selecionados com base em diferenças de produtividade, em condições de déficit hídrico. 

Porém, pouco se sabe sobre os mecanismos fisiológicos determinantes de tal tolerância. 

Objetivou-se, assim, examinar características morfológicas, as respostas estomáticas ao déficit 

hídrico do solo e da atmosfera, as relações hídricas, a eficiência do uso da água (EA) e, 

também, examinar uma possível relação entre tolerância à seca e proteção contra o estresse 

oxidativo. Para isso, quatro clones (46 e 109A, sensíveis; 14 e 120, tolerantes à seca) foram 

cultivados em casa de vegetação, em vasos de 120 L, durante oito meses. O déficit hídrico foi 

imposto via suspensão da irrigação, até que o potencial hídrico na antemanhã (?am) atingisse 

–3,0 MPa. Os clones 109A e 120, sob irrigação, apresentaram maior condutância hidráulica 

entre a raiz e a parte aérea (KL), maior potencial hídrico ao meio-dia e maior acúmulo de 

biomassa. Após 14 dias de suspensão da irrigação, ?am foi significativamente mais negativo 

no clone 109A que nos outros clones; sete dias após, ?am decresceu para –2,3 MPa nos clones 

sensíveis à seca, contra –0,8 MPa e –1,7 MPa nos clones 14 e 120, respectivamente. O clone 

109A foi o primeiro a atingir –3,0 MPa na antemanhã, seguido pelo clone 46, clone 120 e, por 

fim, pelo clone 14. Não foi observado ajustamento elástico em nenhum dos clones, enquanto 

um ajuste osmótico de pequena magnitude foi limitado ao clone 109A, sob condições de seca. 

A condutância estomática (gs) foi reduzida fortemente em resposta aos decréscimos em ?am e, 

em menor extensão, aos incrementos no déficit de pressão de vapor entre folha e atmosfera. A 

sensibilidade estomática à seca, tanto do solo quanto da atmosfera, foi menor no clone 109A e 

similar entre os demais clones. A composição isotópica do carbono (?13C) aumentou 



 4

significativamente, sob seca, em todos os clones, sugerindo incrementos em EA; o clone 

109A, entretanto, apresentou valores mais negativos de ?13C, independentemente do regime 

de irrigação. A profundidade do sistema radicular foi substancialmente maior nos clones 

tolerantes que nos sensíveis à seca. Isso pode explicar, pelo menos em parte, a manutenção de 

um status hídrico mais favorável nos clones tolerantes. O maior valor médio de KL no clone 

120, sob seca, poderia explicar as diferenças de status hídrico entre ele e o clone 14. Em todos 

os clones, gs, KL e o potencial hídrico recuperaram-se rapidamente após a re-irrigação das 

plantas sob déficit hídrico; isso, aliado à forte sensibilidade estomática à seca, pode estar 

associado à resposta notável dessa espécie à irrigação. Independentemente do clone estudado, 

a seca pouco ou nada afetou o transporte de elétrons, a eficiência fotoquímica do fotossistema 

II e os coeficientes de extinção fotoquímico e não-fotoquímico. Comparativamente, o clone 

120 apresentou maior tolerância de seu aparelho fotossintético ao estresse oxidativo mediado 

pela seca ou por ação do paraquat, com poucas diferenças observadas entre os demais clones 

nesse contexto. Sob seca, observaram-se incrementos significativos nas atividades da 

dismutase do superóxido (clones 109A e 120), peroxidase do ascorbato (clones 14, 46 e 

109A), catalase e peroxidase do guaiacol (clones 46 e 109A), e redutase da glutationa (clone 

46). As atividades da redutase do monodesidroascorbato e da redutase do desidroascorbato 

não foram afetadas pelos tratamentos aplicados; as atividades dessas enzimas foram 

substancialmente menores que a da peroxidase do ascorbato. O déficit hídrico acarretou danos 

oxidativos apenas no clone 109A. De modo geral, os clones avaliados foram capazes de 

manter, ou mesmo de aumentar, a atividade de seus sistemas de defesa contra danos 

oxidativos, mesmo a potenciais hídricos da ordem de –3,5 MPa. Em suma, a combinação de 

mecanismos que efetivamente restringem a perda d’água, associada a sistemas radiculares 

profundos, deve ser decisiva para a sobrevivência e, ou, relativa estabilidade da produção dos 

clones de C. canephora tolerantes à seca, quando cultivados em ambientes sujeitos a secas 

prolongadas. Atributos como ajustes osmótico e elástico e proteção contra danos oxidativos 

mediados pela seca teriam uma importância secundária na determinação da tolerância à 

deficiência hídrica nessa espécie.

GENERAL INTRODUCTION 

 

 

Among more than 90 species of Coffea, only C. arabica L. and C. canephora Pierre 

(robusta coffee) are economically important worldwide. The volume of business generated 

from robusta on the international coffee market has been steadily increasing for half a century, 

and presently this species accounts for about 35% of the coffee consumed worldwide. 

Robusta coffee is believed to have evolved in a lowland forest of the Congo river basin 

(Africa), with a typical equatorial climate in which average temperature is between 24 and 26 
oC, and with abundant rainfall distributed over a 9-10 month period, and atmospheric 

humidity at a nearly constant level approaching saturation (Coste 1992, Willson 1999). Under 

plantation schemes, a necessary minimum annual rainfall of 1250 mm, or even 1550 mm, has 

been quoted, but this would require an even distribution (Coste 1992). 

The most cultivated variety of C. canephora in the world is robusta and, thus, it 

designates the common name of this specie. However, in the main Brazilian area producing C. 

canephora (Espírito Santo State), kouillou is the single variety cropped. Despite a large 

similarity between these two varieties, kouillou differs from robusta particularly by presenting 

longer leaves and smaller fruits and beans. Furthermore, kouillou is considered to be more 

resistant to drought than robusta (Coste 1992). In Espírito Santo State, there is an increasing 

trend in expanding cultivation towards marginal and degraded area lands where water 

availability constitutes the bottleneck to crop yield. In these areas, during the dry season, 

which lasts from four to seven months, evaporation by far exceeds rainfall and, within the 

rainy season, rainfall pattern and amounts are to a great extent unpredictable. Such conditions 

could be expected to largely restrict the productive potential of robusta coffee. Local 

experience has shown that crop yield under rainfed conditions may decrease by about 40% or 

even as much as by 80% in dry years. Irrigation has been successfully employed, enabling the 

plant to be a profitable crop and preventing crop failure in dry years. However, costs involved 

for purchasing and installing irrigation equipment are rather expensive and immediately pose 

a problem for the profitability of its use, particularly in small farms where robusta coffee is 



 6

mostly cultivated. In addition, a permanent, reliable source of water for irrigation is not 

always available. 

Robusta coffee is an obligate cross-pollination species and, therefore, a wide population 

variation in morphological/physiological traits to cope with drought is to be expected 

(DaMatta and Rena 2001). Plant breeders of INCAPER (Institute for Research and Rural 

Assistance of the State of Espírito Santo) have successfully explored such genetic variability, 

so that clones of robusta coffee with superior performance under rainfed conditions have been 

recently selected, what may render coffee cultivation less dependent on irrigation. 

Nonetheless, such selection has been conducted largely in terms of saleable crop (e.g. Ferrão 

et al 2000a, b), without physiologically examining how clones respond to soil drought. 

The ability for a crop to produce satisfactorily in areas subjected to water deficit has been 

termed drought tolerance regardless of how the ability develops (Kramer and Boyer 1995). 

Plants may develop morphological and/or physiological mechanisms to cope with a limited 

water conditions. These involve maximisation in water uptake by growing deep roots and/or 

minimisation of water loss by way of an effective stomatal closure and reduced leaf area 

(Kramer and Boyer 1995), improving plant water status and turgor maintenance. In any case, 

in the field, water deficit is generally combined with high solar radiation, triggering an 

enhanced production of reactive oxygen species, which may result in oxidative damage to cell 

compartments, especially chloroplasts (Smirnoff 1995) and, ultimately, in decreases in crop 

yield. To protect the photosynthetic apparatus from oxidative stress, plants must dissipate 

excess light energy. This can be achieved by down-regulation of the photochemical efficiency 

by way of the xanthophyll cycle (Demming-Adams et al. 1996) or by maintenance of electron 

flux involving alternative routes such as photorespiration and the Mehler-peroxidase pathway 

(Asada 1999, Ort and Baker 2002). Morphological adaptations such as leaf rolling and 

alterations in leaf orientation can also contribute to decrease photo-inhibitory damage and 

excessive transpiration. 

In this work, it were explored the extent and mechanisms of intra-specific variation of 

water use in C. canephora var. kouillou by examining how stomatal behaviour and leaf water 

relations are adjusted to changes in soil water supply and evaporative demand, and how 

differences in drought tolerance is associated with morphological characteristics such as root 

depth and leaf area. In addition, it was also examined whether differences in clonal tolerance 

to drought stress could be associated with an enhanced protection of the photosynthetic 

apparatus against oxidative stress. For these purposes, drought-tolerant genotypes (clones 14 

and 120) and drought-sensitive ones (clones 46 and 109A) of robusta coffee were compared. 



 7

These clones have been shown to produce a good crop when grown under irrigation; under 

limited soil water, however, both survival and productivity (Ferrão et al. 2000a, b) as well as 

maintenance of tissue water status (DaMatta et al. 2000, 2003) are impaired to a greater extent 

in the drought-sensitive than in the drought-tolerant clones. The clones were grown in large 

containers in an attempt to simulate a natural development of drought down a root profile, so 

that the plants could acclimate to decreasing soil water availability.

Summary Physiological and morphological bases of drought tolerance in robusta coffee 

(Coffea canephora Pierre var. kouillou) were investigated. Four clones representing drought-

tolerant (14 and 120) and drought-sensitive (46 and 109A) genotypes were grown in 120-l 

containers under screen house conditions. Drought was imposed by withholding watering 

until xylem pressure potential (?x) reached about –3.0 MPa at predawn. Under full irrigation, 

soil-to-leaf hydraulic conductance (KL), midday ?x and total biomass were all greater in 

clones 109A and 120 than in the other clones. For all clones, dehydration postponement was 

more important than dehydration tolerance. This was associated with (i) strong stomatal 

sensitivity to soil drying and, to a lesser extent, to leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficit; (ii) 

increases in leaf carbon isotope composition in stressed plants, suggesting higher water-use 

efficiency; and (iii) relatively high modulus of elasticity. Dehydration postponement was less 

developed in drought-sensitive clones than in drought-tolerant ones, which might in part to be

associated with shallower root systems in the former than in the latter. Clone 109A had the 

least conservative water-use characteristics and, thus, it showed a faster decline in ?x than 

clone 46 after suspending irrigation. On average, the larger KL in clone 120 than in clone 14 

might explain why the latter was better able to postpone dehydration. There was no evidence 

of elastic adjustment in response to drought, whereas osmotic adjustment was small and 

limited to clone 109A. For all clones, ?x, gs and KL recovered rapidly following re-watering. 

The combination of mechanisms that effectively postpone dehydration, associated with deep 

root systems, should contribute to survival and/or stability of crop yield of drought-tolerant 

clones in regions with unpredictable rainfall.

Introduction 

For cultivated plants tolerance to drought is generally considered as the potential for a 

particular species or variety to yield more in comparison to others under limited soil water 

conditions (Jones 1992). Plants may develop morphological and/or physiological mechanisms 

to cope with a limited water supply. These involve maximisation in water uptake by growing 

deep roots and/or minimisation of water loss by way of an effective stomatal closure and 

reduced leaf area (Kramer and Boyer 1995), improving plant water status and turgor 

maintenance. Turgor maintenance, which provides the potential for keeping physiological 

activity for extended periods of drought, may be achieved through an osmotic adjustment 

and/or changes in cell wall elasticity (Kramer and Boyer 1995, Turner 1997). 

Robusta coffee (Coffea canephora Pierre), which accounts for about 35% of the coffee 

consumed worldwide, is native to typical African equatorial climate zone with abundant 

rainfall distributed over a 9-10 month period, and atmospheric humidity at a nearly constant 

level approaching saturation (Willson 1999). For this reason, robusta is thought to have 

evolved as a water-profligate species (DaMatta and Rena 2001). However, in Brazil it has 

been largely cultivated in marginal areas where water availability constitutes the major 

environmental constraint affecting crop production. Consequently, irrigation has been 

indispensable for production in those areas where even short periods of drought can largely 

decrease coffee yields. 



 12

Robusta coffee is an obligate cross-pollination species and, therefore, a wide population 

variation in morphological/physiological traits to cope with drought is to be expected 

(DaMatta and Rena 2001). Plant breeders have successfully explored such genetic variability, 

so that clones of robusta with superior performance under rainfed conditions have been 

recently selected, what may render coffee cultivation less dependent on irrigation. 

Nonetheless, such selection has been conducted largely in terms of harvestable crop (e.g., 

Ferrão et al 2000a, b), without examining physiologically how clones respond to soil drought. 

In this work, drought-tolerant genotypes (clones 14 and 120) and drought-sensitive ones 

(clones 46 and 109A) of robusta coffee were compared. These clones have been shown to 

produce a good crop when grown under irrigation; under limited soil water, however, both 

survival and productivity (Ferrão et al. 2000a, b) as well as maintenance of tissue water status 

(DaMatta et al. 2003, Pinheiro et al. 2004) are impaired to a greater extent in the drought-

sensitive than in the drought-tolerant clones. Comparatively, however, maintenance of water 

status is better, but stability of crop yield is poorer, in clone 14 than in clone 120. An initial 

objective of this study was to identify mechanisms of intra-specific variation of water use by 

examining how stomatal behaviour and leaf water relations are adjusted to changes in soil 

water supply and evaporative demand. A second objective was to assess whether differences 

in drought tolerance is associated with morphological characteristics such as root depth and 

leaf area. For these purposes, morphological traits, leaf xylem pressure potential (?x), 

stomatal conductance (gs), hydraulic conductance (KL), stable carbon isotope composition, 

?13C (to study integrated plant water use; Farquhar et al. 1989), and water relations 

parameters derived from pressure-volume curves were evaluated. The clones were grown in 

large containers in an attempt to simulate a natural development of drought down a root 

profile, so that the plants could acclimate to water shortage. Leaf water relations were 

examined at a similar internal water status, thus allowing more reliable comparisons among 

clones to be made. 

 

Materials and methods 

General 

Clones of C. canephora Pierre var. kouillou (known in Brazil as Conilon) raised as rooted 

stem cuttings were obtained from the Institute for Research and Rural Assistance of Espírito 

Santo State (INCAPER), Brazil. Forty plants (10 per each clone) were grown under screen 

house conditions in Viçosa (20o45’ S, 650 m a.s.l.), southeastern Brazil, with an average 

midday photosynthetic photon flux about 900 µmol m-2 s-1, in large containers (0.8 m high, 



 13

0.44 m internal diameter) filled with an 120 l mixture of soil, sand and hardened manure 

(3:1:1, v/v/v) and a gravel layer at the bottom. The walls of the screenhouse consisted of 

coarse mesh screen, which permitted free exchange of air with the external environment. 

When plants were 12-months old, water deficit was imposed by withholding watering until ?x 

at predawn (?pd) reached about –3.0 MPa. Throughout the dry-down period, five sets of 

measurements of ?x and gs were performed using leaves from the third or fourth pair from the 

apex of plagiotropic branches. Once the desired ?pd was reached, expanding leaves (less than 

half of their final size) were collected and their ?13C was estimated; expanded leaves were 

also collected for obtaining pressure-volume relationships. All the plants were then irrigated 

(at about 1800 h) and ?x and KL were estimated in the following two consecutive days (?pd 

measured at about 12 and 36 h after irrigation). 

 

Biometric measurements 

Three branches per tree were tagged when water was withheld, and their growth was 

estimated as the difference between initial and final length, as measured 21 days latter. At the 

end of the experiment, well-watered plants were harvested and separated into aboveground 

parts and roots. Leaf area was measured with an area meter (Area Measurement System, 

Delta-T Devices, Cambridge, UK). Roots were washed thoroughly with tap water above a 

0.5-mm screen sieve. Plant tissues were then oven-dried at 72 °C for 72 h, after which dry 

matter was determined. Shoot height and root depth were also measured. 

 

Water relations 

Xylem pressure potential was measured at predawn (0430-0530 h), between 0700-0900 h and 

at midday (?md) using a Scholander-type pressure chamber. To obtain pressure-volume 

curves, fully expanded leaves were collected by cutting their petioles under deionised water 

and brought to the laboratory. This was done at about 12 h after irrigating both control and 

drought-stressed plants (?x typically above –0.10 MPa). Subsequently, fresh weight and ?x 

were taken at intervals during dehydration process (free transpiration technique) until a ?x of 

about –3.5 MPa was reached. Turgid weight was estimated from the linear relationship 

between fresh weight and ?x in the positive turgor range, by extrapolating to ?x = 0. The 

inverse of ?x was plotted as a function of relative water content (RWC). From the pressure-

volume curves, the osmotic potential at full (?? (100)) and zero (?? (0)) turgor, RWC at zero 



 14

turgor (RWC(0)) and the bulk modulus of elasticity (?; Melkonian et al. 1982) were estimated. 

Further details are described in DaMatta et al. (1993). 

 

Stomatal and hydraulic conductance 

Stomatal conductance to water vapour was measured with a portable open-system infrared gas 

analyser (LCA-4, ADC, Hoddesdon, UK), as described in DaMatta et al. (1997). 

Measurements were made between 0700 and 0900 h (25 ± 2 °C air temperature, 90 ± 2% air 

relative humidity) and between 1100 and 1300 h (30 ± 2 °C air temperature, 80 ± 2% air 

relative humidity). 

Leaf specific hydraulic conductance from soil to leaf (KL = (gs x ?w)/(?pd – ?md)) was 

calculated using ?pd to approximate soil water potential, and gs and ?w (leaf-to-air vapour 

pressure deficit, estimated according to Landsberg (1986)), measured at the same time as ?md 

(Hubbard et al. 1999, Donovan et al. 2000). 

 

Carbon isotope composition 

Leaf ?13C was measured relative to the international PBD standard using a mass spectrometer 

(Delta-S, Finnigan MAT, Bremen, Germany), as previously described (DaMatta et al. 2002). 

Differences in ?13C from duplicates for each sample were below 0.2‰. 

 

Statistics 

The experiment was set up in a completely randomised design, with eight treatment-

combinations, forming a 4 x 2 factorial (four clones and two watering regimes) with five 

plants per treatment-combination. The experimental plot was constituted by one plant per 

container. Significant differences among treatment means were tested by the Newman-Keuls 

and F tests, at P ? 0.05. Regression analyses were used to examine relationships between 

physiological and/or environmental variables. The relationship between gs and ?pd was non-

linear and data were natural log transformed for the analysis. Based on regression analysis, ln 

gs was found to be significantly linearly related to ?pd. 

A test for the equality of the regression models was performed using the indicator variable 

technique (Neter and Wasserman 1974), at P ? 0.05. Regression models for clones 14, 46 and 

120 did not differ statistically to each other. Therefore, data for these clones were pooled 

together and single regressions were fitted to the lumped data. 



 15

Results 

The selected clones (14 and 120, drought-tolerant; 46 and 109A, drought-sensitive) could be 

grouped into two types of contrasting canopy morphologies, with clones 109A and 120 being 

taller (Table 1) with less dense crowns than clones 14 and 46. There was no significant 

difference in both total leaf area and specific leaf area among the clones investigated, but total 

dry matter and root biomass were greater in clones 109A and 120 than in clones 14 and 46, 

whereas root to shoot biomass ratio were larger in clone 109A than in the other clones (Table 

1). In any case, the drought-tolerant clones exhibited a considerably deeper (Table 1), more 

regularly distributed root system down a pot profile than the drought-sensitive clones (not 

shown). 

For control plants, ?pd was always above –0.08 MPa. In these plants, average ?md tended 

to be lower in clones 14 and 46, respectively –0.89 and –1.06 MPa, against –0.65 MPa in 

clones 109A and 120 (Figure 1). On average, KL tended to be higher in these clones (about 3.0 

mmol m-2 s-1 MPa-1) than in clones 14 and 46 (about 1.7 mmol m-2 s-1 MPa-1). Under drought 

stress, average KL tended to be greater in clone 120 than in the other clones (Figure 2).

 18

After withholding irrigation for 14 days, ?pd was significantly lower in clone 109A than 

in the other clones; seven days latter, ?pd dropped to about –2.3 MPa in clones 46 and 109A, 

against – 0.8 MPa in clone 14 and –1.7 MPa in clone 120. A similar trend, but obviously 

shifted to lower values, was found for ?md (Figure 1). As could be expected from the above, 

clone 109A attained –3.0 MPa at predawn earlier, followed by clone 46, clone 120, and then 

clone 14 in this order (Figure 1). A prompt recovery of ?x and KL was found for all clones in 

the first two days upon re-watering (Figures 1 and 2). 

Stomatal conductance decreased curvilinearly as ?pd declined (Figure 3). Stomatal 

sensitivity to changes in ?pd was similar among clones 14, 46 and 120, but lower in clone 

109A than in the other clones, as indicated by the slope of regression lines. Similar regression 

models were found when gs was associated with ?x, both variables measured on a same leaf 

at 0700-0900 h (not shown).

Figure 3. Stomatal conductance (gs) in relation to leaf xylem pressure potential at predawn 

(?pd) in four clones of robusta coffee. Values of gs were taken at 0700-0900 h and represent 

the entire data set from plants subjected to a dehydrating cycle after selecting a narrow range 

of leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficit (1.5 kPa at most). The data were fitted by a power 

function of the form y = axb by nonlinear regression in the insets, and by linear regression in 

the main panels. The explained variance (r2) was similar for both linear and nonlinear 

regressions. 



 19

As ?w increased, gs decreased linearly in a similar way in clones 14, 46 and 120. By 

contrast, there was no relationship in clone 109A between gs and ?w (Figure 4). In spite of ?w 

and leaf temperature being greatly associated to each other (r2 = 0.920, P &amp;lt;0.001), co-

variation analysis revealed no direct effect of leaf temperature in the response of gs to ?w (P = 

0.173). 

Clonal differences in drought tolerance could hardly be associated with either or both 

osmotic and elastic adjustments, since ?? (100), ?? (0) and ?  did not differ significantly among 

clones under full irrigation or drought conditions, with exception of the clone 109A, in which 

drought resulted in a slight, significant decrease (0.19 MPa) in ?? (0) (Table 2). Irrespective of 

treatments, quite constant and similar values for RWC(0) (89.8 ± 0.5%) were found (Table 2).

Figure 4. Stomatal conductance (gs) in relation to leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficit (?w) in 

four clones of robusta coffee under irrigated conditions. Data were obtained over several days 

under conditions of naturally fluctuating ?w; they were collected at 1100–1300 h in plants 

grown under full irrigation to insure a comparable internal water status (xylem pressure 

potential = -0.8 ± 0.2 MPa). For clone 109A, relationship between gs and ?w was not 

significant. 



 20

After imposing water deficit, ?13C increased significantly (1.48 to 2.22‰; Figure 5) in all 

clones, suggesting an increased long-term water-use efficiency (WUE). Nonetheless, absolute 

values of ?13C were lower in clone 109A than in the other clones irrespective of the irrigation 

treatments. There was no difference in ?13C among clones 14, 46 and 120 (Figure 5). Overall, 

gs decreased to a greater extent than net carbon assimilation rate (data not shown) and, thus, 

adjustments in ?13C should have been predominantly from changes in gs. 

Under continuous irrigation, clone 109A showed a larger branch growth (28%) than the 

averaged growth of the other clones, in which branch growth did not differ regardless of the 

watering treatments (Figure 6). Under drought conditions, branch growth decreased by about 

45% in drought-sensitive clones against a 31% reduction in clone 14 and 37% in clone 120. 

 

Discussion 

Plant water stress developed more slowly in the drought-tolerant than in the drought-sensitive 

clones. Morphological traits such as leaf area, root mass or root to shoot mass ratio were not 

associated with that response. Instead, the much deeper root system of the tolerant clones 

should have enabled them to gaining a greater access to soil water and, therefore, maintaining 

a more favourable internal water status longer than in drought-sensitive clones. Differences 

between drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive clones in postponing tissue dehydration are 

even more evident in the field (DaMatta et al. 2000, 2003), where the development of the root 

system is much less restricted. Differences in dehydration postponement were also linked to 

stomatal control on transpiration (see below). 

Hydraulic conductance is positively associated with rates of water use, as has been found 

in genotypes of C. arabica (Tausend et al. 2000). Thus the larger KL, as observed in clones 

109A and 120 under full irrigation, might at least partially explain their smaller variations in 

?x (as indicated by higher ?md values) than in clones 14 and 46, which may help to avoid 

limitations to photosynthesis. As a consequence, the clones 109A and 120 might have 

achieved a greater carbon gain, which would to some extent explain their greater biomass 

accumulation. This would be advantageous with non-limiting soil water or with brief periods 

of water deficit, but disadvantageous with long-term drought since a high KL may hasten the 

development of severe internal water deficit. This could be partially offset by a deeper root 

system as is the case of clone 120. 

Stomatal conductance decreased sharply with decreasing ?x, with no apparent threshold 

value of ?pd at which stomatal closure was observed. This behaviour had been already 



 21

reported for young plants of three coffee species, including robusta (Kanechi et al. 1995b), 

and also for other tree species (e.g., Menzel and Simpson 1986, Gucci et al. 1996, Arndt et al. 

2001, Xu and Balocchi 2003). The positive relation between gs and ?x is expected when soil 

moisture changes and indirectly affects stomata through a hydraulic feedback (Jones 1998). 

The rapid recovery of ?x after re-watering, which was accompanied by the recovery of gs, 

emphasise the role of leaf water status on stomatal control, as suggested by Fuchs and 

Livingston (1996). When considered together, these responses should explain greatly why 

robusta coffee responds strongly to irrigation (DaMatta 2004).  

Stomatal sensitivity to evaporative demand, as observed in clones 14, 46 and 120, might 

indicate the setting up of a feedforward response that would allow them to avoid large internal 

water deficits (Meinzer et al. 1993). Such a sensitivity appears to be weaker in robusta coffee 

than in C. arabica since in the latter gs decreases curvilinearly with increasing ?w (Gutiérrez 

et al. 1994, Kanechi et al. 1995a). Because C. arabica evolved in a region relatively drier than 

robusta, the requirement for an efficient stomatal control on transpiration would not thus be as 

imperative in robusta as in C. arabica (DaMatta 2003). In fact, the lower sensitivity of gs to 

?w in the clone 109A might represent an adaptation to the humid climate of the equatorial 

region where robusta coffee is believed to have evolved. In this clone, stomatal responses to 

both soil and atmospheric drought should have resulted in a more prodigal use of water and, 

as a consequence, in more negative ?13C (lower long-term WUE) regardless of the watering 

regime. This observation is partially in line with those of Meinzer et al. (1990a). They showed 

that genotypes of C. arabica with higher carbon isotope discrimination (lower ?13C) under 

full irrigation depleted soil water more rapidly and experienced symptoms of physiological 

stress earlier when water was withheld. One must be cautious, however, since this study was 

small to provide a conclusive answer about the usefulness of ?13C as an index for ranking 

clones of robusta coffee in terms of drought tolerance. 

Osmotic adjustment has been associated with reduced stomatal sensitivity and maintenance 

of gas exchange under drought conditions (Turner 1997). In this work, however, its amplitude 

was too small and limited to clone 109A. Thus osmotic adjustment could hardly explain the 

low stomatal sensitivity to drought in this clone. Incidentally, development of increased leaf 

water deficits upon discontinuing irrigation may be faster in coffee genotypes having greater 

amplitude of osmotic adjustment (Meinzer et al. 1990b, DaMatta et al. 1993). Therefore, 

osmotic adjustment should be of limited importance (Munns 1988) in determining drought 

tolerance in robusta coffee, as has also been reported for several other woody species (Fan et

al. 1994). Where it occurs, osmotic adjustment either may not persist for long under drought, 

or functions over a limited range of ?x-values (Blake et al. 1991). 

The clones herein evaluated lost turgor at values of ?x between –2.1 and –2.4 MPa. They 

showed relatively high values of ? (i.e., greater tissue rigidity), which resulted in high RWC(0), 

as already reported earlier (DaMatta et al. 1993, 2002, 2003). These traits were consistent 

with the strong stomatal sensitivity to water deficit mediated by rapid loss of turgor as a 

consequence of inelastic leaf tissues (White et al. 2000). One must be cautious, however, 

because changes in relative symplast volume rather than changes in leaf turgor per se were 

associated with stomatal aperture, as shown by Meinzer et al. (1990b) working with cultivars 

of C. arabica subjected to drought. In any case, maintenance of high RWC at low ?x appears 

to be a means of the coffee tree avoiding, instead of tolerating, dehydration (DaMatta et al. 

1993). 

The drought-induced reduction in branch growth could not be associated with adjustments 

in cell wall extensibility or in osmotic properties. Since elongation growth is sensitive to 

changes in turgor pressure (Kramer and Boyer 1995), the smaller decreases in growth of the 

drought-tolerant clones than those of the drought-sensitive ones should have been largely a 

consequence of the maintenance of a better water status for longer in the former. Such 

assumption might also explain, at least in part, the differences in branch growth between the 

clones 14 and 120. 

In conclusion, clonal ability to postpone dehydration was more important than dehydration 

tolerance, and cell water relations were largely unable to adjust to drought stress in either 

clone. The clone 109A, although possessing greater root to shoot mass ratio, is shallow-rooted 

and showed a relatively poor stomatal control on transpiration; these features could explain 

why it experienced symptoms of drought stress earlier after suspending irrigation. The clone 

46 is also shallow-rooted but exhibited a better stomatal sensitivity to both soil and 

atmospheric drought; hence the clone 46 was better able to delay dehydration than the clone 

109A. Similarly to clone 46, stomatal sensitivity to drought was well developed in clones 14 

and 120, but these clones showed a remarkably deeper root system than the drought-sensitive 

clones, which could explain their better avoidance to drought. In any case, the larger KL in 

clone 120 than in clone 14 might be involved in the faster decrease in ?pd in the former. 

Finally, the direct response of stomata to changes in ?x and ?w should have important 

consequences for clonal ability to support relatively long periods of soil drought associated 

with high atmospheric evaporative demand. Such behaviour would be advantageous for the 

coffee clones, allowing for maximisation of WUE and survival as soil water availability 



 25

decreases. In this case, stomatal sensitivity to soil drying should be negatively associated with 

stability of crop yield under rainfed conditions. However, stomata may not respond to soil 

water limitations as readily and dramatically in mature field-grown trees as in young plants 

like those of this study with less expanded root systems (Gucci et al. 1996, DaMatta 2003). If 

so, a deeper root system compensating for water loss during the day would be of paramount 

importance. Of course, this should be possible if the plant maintains a sufficient KL. Thus, 

combination of deep roots with relatively large KL should contribute to dampen variations 

both in plant water status and productivity, as particularly observed in the clone 120 grown in 

seasonally-dry regions that experience satisfactory annual precipitation (Ferrão et al. 2000a, 

DaMatta et al. 2003).

Abstract 

Four clones of Coffea canephora (Robusta coffee) representing drought-tolerant (14 and 120) 

and drought-sensitive (46 and 109A) genotypes were submitted to slowly imposed water 

deficit, until predawn leaf water potential approximately –3.0 MPa was reached. Drought-

tolerant clones were better able to maintain their leaf water status than drought-sensitive 

clones after withholding irrigation. Regardless of the clones investigated, the net carbon 

assimilation rate decreased under drought stress, but little or no effect of drought on the 

quantum yield of electron transport was observed. The photosynthetic apparatus of clone 120 

was more tolerant to both drought and paraquat-mediated oxidative stress, with no clear 

distinction amongst the other clones in this regard. Drought triggered increases in superoxide 

dismutase (clones 109A and 120), ascorbate peroxidase (clones 14, 46 and 109A), catalase 

and guaiacol peroxidase (clones 46 and 109A), and also in glutathione reductase (clone 46) 

and dehydroascorbate reductase (clone 109A). Activity of monodehydroascorbate reductase 

was not induced in drought-stressed plants. Maximal catalytic activities of the two last 

enzymes were much lower than that of ascorbate peroxidase, irrespective of the clone 

investigated. No drought-induced decrease in enzyme activity was found, except for 

glutathione reductase in clone 120. In any case, oxidative damage appeared to be evident only 

in clone 109A. Overall, there was no apparent link between protection against oxidative stress 

with differences in clonal tolerance to drought.

1. Introduction 

Upon moderate drought conditions, photosynthesis decreases mainly due to stomatal 

closure. As the stress progresses, biochemical constraints may limit the photosynthetic CO2 

fixation more directly [1]. Excess energy may result, which is potentially harmful to 

photosystem (PS) II because of over-reduction of photosynthetic electron chain and increased 

production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in chloroplasts [2]. Additionally, mitochondria 

and peroxisomes are also potential producers of ROS [2,3]. 

To protect the photosynthetic apparatus from oxidative stress, plants must dissipate excess 

light energy. This can be achieved by down-regulation of the photochemical efficiency by 

way of the xanthophyll cycle [4] or by maintenance of electron flux involving alternative 



 

 31

pathways such as photorespiration and the Mehler-peroxidase reaction [2,5]. However, both 

pathways lead to an increased production of ROS such as superoxide (O2
·—) and H2O2. To 

cope with ROS, plants are endowed with a complex enzymatic antioxidant system including 

superoxide dismutases (SOD), which catalyse the reaction from O2
·— to H2O2, and catalase 

(CAT) and enzymes of the ascorbate (Asc)/glutathione (GSH) cycle, which function to 

detoxify the H2O2 produced [2,6]. A guaiacol-type peroxidase (GPX) can also participate in 

H2O2 scavenging. In addition, detoxification of ROS can be conducted by means of 

antioxidant molecules, both lipophilic (?-tocopherol, ?-carotene) and hydrophilic (Asc, 

GHS). The latter can act as direct scavengers for ROS, and both compounds are also 

reductants in the Asc/GSH cycle [6]. Failure in antioxidant defence system may result in 

oxidative damage to several cell constituents such as proteins, DNA and membrane lipids [2]. 

If drought stress proceeds slowly, an array of time-dependent morphological and 

physiological acclimation responses may occur, thus largely expanding the range and kind of 

plant responses that can take place with soil water shortage [7]. Despite this, many studies 

concerning drought effects on tree crop physiology have been conducted using plants grown 

in small containers that limit root growth. Such an approach does not allow the phenomenon 

of acclimation to occur, with observations largely dependent on the rate of stress progression 

[7]. Another feature of many experiments resides in comparisons among species or genotypes 

after they suffer from a given period without irrigation. Comparisons made under such 

circumstances may be misleading since plants ordinarily show quite variable internal water 

status. 

Robusta coffee (Coffea canephora Pierre) is largely cultivated in drought-prone areas, thus 

leading to crop failure in dry years. There seems to be considerable clonal variation in drought 

tolerance within this species [8]. Working with two clones submitted to rapidly imposed 

drought, Lima et al. [9] proposed that drought tolerance in Robusta coffee might be at least 

partially associated with enhanced activity of antioxidant enzymes. In fact, increased 

expression of the antioxidant system has been associated with decreased oxidative damage in 

different drought-tolerant species or genotypes [10]. In this study, the major goal was to test 

the hypothesis that drought-tolerant clones differ from drought-sensitive ones at a biochemical 

level, through enhanced protection of the photosynthetic apparatus against oxidative stress. 

For this purpose, leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters, the enzymatic 

antioxidant system, Asc redox state, lipid peroxidation, as well as tolerance to oxidative stress 

mediated by paraquat were investigated. The clones were grown in large containers in an 

attempt to simulate a natural progression of drought down a root profile, so that the plants 



 

 32

could acclimate to water shortage. Plant responses were also measured at a similar internal 

water status allowing more reliable comparisons among clones to be made. 

 

 
2. Material and methods 

2.1. Plant material, growth conditions and sampling procedures 

Four coffee clones representing drought-tolerant (14 and 120) and drought-sensitive (46 

and 109A) genotypes were used. The selected clones have been shown to produce a good crop 

when grown under irrigation; under limited soil water, however, both survival and 

productivity are severely impaired in the drought-sensitive clones, with minor effects in the 

drought-tolerant ones, as has been observed in field experiments of the Institute for Research 

and Rural Assistance of the State of Espírito Santo, Brazil [Romário Ferrão, personal 

communication]. In addition, tolerant clones are better able to maintain their tissue water 

status upon discontinuing irrigation than drought-sensitive clones [11].  

Plants obtained as rooted stem cuttings were four months old at planting. They were grown 

under greenhouse conditions, with an average midday photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) 

about 900 µmol m-2 s-1, in large containers (0.8 m high, 0.44 m internal diameter) filled with 

an 120 l mixture of soil, sand and hardened manure (3:1:1, v/v/v) and a gravel layer at the 

bottom. When the plants were 12 months old, water deficit was imposed by withholding 

watering until leaf water potential (?w), as measured periodically with a Scholander-type 

pressure chamber, reached around –3.0 MPa at predawn (about –3.5 MPa at midday). All 

sampling and measurements were made using leaves from the third or fourth pair from the 

apex of plagiotropic branches. For biochemical analyses, leaf tissue (0.3 g FW per tree for 

each parameter), collected at about midday, was rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 

–80oC until processing. For paraquat-mediated oxidative stress, four leaf discs (1 cm2 each) 

per tree were collected and immediately assayed. 

 

2.2. Biometric data 

Leaf area was measured with an area meter (Area Measurement System, Delta-T Devices, 

Cambridge, UK). Roots were washed thoroughly with tap water above a 0.5-mm screen sieve. 

Plant dry mass was determined after drying plant material at 72oC for 72 h. Shoot height and 

root depth were also measured. 



 

 33

2.3. Responses to paraquat-mediated oxidative stress 

Leaf discs, collected from well-watered plants, were floated with adaxial side up on 0, 5 

and 15 µM paraquat. In a preliminary experiment, discs vacuum-infiltrated with paraquat 

solutions were compared with discs to which paraquat was allowed to be absorbed freely, 

giving similar results. Discs  were then exposed for 16 h at 25°C in the dark to allow paraquat 

diffusion into them, following by incubation for 3 h at PPF of 200 µmol m-2 s-1. 

Subsequently, leaf discs were dark-incubated for 3 h at 25oC. The paraquat-dependent ROS 

damage was estimated according to [12], from the reduction of the variable to maximum 

fluorescence ratio (Fv/Fm), measured as described below. 

 

2.4. Photosynthetic parameters 

The net carbon assimilation rate (A), internal to ambient CO2 concentration ratio (Ci/Ca) 

and stomatal conductance to water vapour (gs) were measured at 0800-0900 hours under 

artificial, saturating PPF (850-900 µmol m-2 s-1) with a portable open-system infrared gas 

analyser (LCA-4, ADC, Hoddesdon, UK), as described in [13]. Chlorophyll a fluorescence 

was measured with a portable pulse amplitude modulation fluorometer (FMS2, Hansatech, 

King’s Lynn, Norfolk, UK) using actinic PPF of 900 µmol m-2 s-1 for 480 s and an 1-s pulse 

of saturating light of 6000 µmol m-2 s-1. Measurements of the Fv/Fm ratio were made 

following dark-adaptation for 30 min. Further technical details have been given previously 

[9,14]. Photochemical quenching coefficient (qp), Stern-Volmer non-photochemical 

quenching coefficient (NPQ) and the quantum yield of PSII electron transport (?PSII) were 

calculated as described in [15]. The fraction of PPF absorbed in PSII antennae that was 

neither used in photochemistry nor dissipated thermally (PE) was calculated according to [4]. 

All the above measurements were carried out at ambient CO2, 25 ± 2 
oC air temperature and 

80 ± 2% relative humidity. 

 
2.5. Biochemical assays 

Leaf tissue was ground in a cold mortar and pestle using polyvinylpolypyrrolidone and the 

following extraction buffers: SOD, EC 1.15.1.1 [100 mM K-phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 0.1 

mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 15 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100]; CAT, EC 

1.11.1.6 and Asc peroxidase (APX, EC 1.11.1.11) [50 mM K-phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 2 mM 

EDTA, 20 mM Asc and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100]; glutathione reductase (GR, EC 1.6.4.2) 

[100 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 50 µM EDTA, 10 mM isoascorbate, 9 mM 2-

mercaptoethanol, 3 mM DTT and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100]; monodehydroascorbate (MDA) 



 

 34

reductase (MDAR, EC 1.6.5.4) and dehydroascorbate (DHA) reductase (DHAR, EC 1.8.5.1) 

[100 mM K-phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Asc and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-

100]; and GPX, EC1.11.1.7 [50 mM K-phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM Asc 

and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100]. The resulting slurry was centrifuged at 20000 g for 20 min. 

Supernatants were collected and used for enzymatic assays and determination of protein 

content [16]. For MDAR and DHAR, enzyme extract was previously gel-filtered over 

Sephadex G-25 columns. All the above operations were conducted at 0-4 °C. 

Activities of total SOD, APX and CAT were determined as described earlier [9]. Activities 

of GR and DHAR and activity of MDAR were assayed by measuring the rate of NADPH and 

NADH oxidation, respectively, both at 340 nm. A suitable amount of enzyme extract and the 

following reaction media were used: GR (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM oxidised GSH, 3 

mM MgCl2, and 0.15 mM NADPH) [17], MDAR (50 mM K-phosphate buffer under N2 

atmosphere, pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM NADH, 400 mM sucrose, 2.5 mM 

Asc and 0.14 units Asc oxidase for generating MDA) [18] and DHAR (50 mM K-phosphate 

buffer, pH 6.1, 0.2 mM NADPH, 2.5 mM GSH, 2.5 mM DHA and 0.6 units GR) [19]. GPX 

activity was determined following the increase in absorbance at 470 nm using a reaction 

mixture containing 50 mM K-phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM guaiacol and 

10 mM H2O2 [20]. Where appropriate, controls were run to correct for interferences. Enzyme 

activities were expressed on a total protein basis since the overall leaf protein concentration, 

either on a dry mass or on an area basis, remained largely unaffected under drought 

conditions. Indeed, enzyme activities were quite similar regardless of expressed on an area or 

on a protein basis (data not shown). 

Asc and DHA were determined as described in [21], with some modifications. Leaf tissue 

was ground in 6 ml 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and the resulting slurry was centrifuged at 

10000 g for 15 min at 4 °C. A 20 µl aliquot of the supernatant was diluted to 500 µl using 5% 

(w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Total Asc (Asc + DHA) was determined after reduction of DHA by 

DTT. To 500 µl diluted sample extract were added 250 µl 0.06% (w/v) DTT/ethanol and 250 

µl 0.2 M Na2HPO4-1.2 M NaOH. The mixture was then incubated for 10 min at 25 °C. 

Subsequently, the following reagents, dissolved in absolute ethanol, were added: 250 µl 

0.24% (w/v) N-ethylmaleimide, 250 µl 4% (v/v) H3PO4, 500 µl 0.5% (w/v) 

bathophenanthroline and 500 µl 0.03% (w/v) FeCl3, in a 2.5 ml final volume. The mixture 

was vigorously mixed and incubated at 30°C for 90 min. The resulting absorbance was read at 



 

 35

534 nm. Asc was determined as described above, with omission of DTT. DHA was deduced 

from the difference of total Asc and Asc. 

Malondealdehyde (MAld), assayed as described in [9], was used as an estimation of lipid 

peroxidation. 

 

2.6. Statistics 

The plants were distributed over a completely randomised single-tree plot design, with 

eight treatment-combinations, forming a 4 x 2 factorial (four clones and two watering 

regimes) with four or five replicates. For biochemical data, each replicate represented the 

mean of three determinations on the same sample. Data were statistically examined using 

analysis of variance and tested for significant (P ? 0.05) clone and irrigation treatment 

differences using Newman-Keuls and F tests. 

 

 

3. Results and discussion 

3.1. Biometric traits and water status 

The selected clones (14 and 120, drought-tolerant; 46 and 109A, drought-sensitive) could 

be grouped into two types of contrasting canopy morphologies, with the clones 109A and 120 

being taller (Table 1) with less dense crowns than the clones 14 and 46. There was no 

significant difference in total leaf area among the clones evaluated, but root biomass and root 

to shoot biomass ratio were greater in clone 109A than in the other clones (Table 1). 

However, the root system was about 50% deeper in the drought-tolerant than in the drought-

sensitive clones (Table 1); additionally, the tolerant clones exhibited a more regularly 

distributed root system down a pot profile than the drought-sensitive ones (not shown). This 

might be partially linked to the slower rate of decline in predawn ?w in the former than in the 

latter clones after withholding irrigation (Table 2). In fact, in the field, where the development 

of the root system is much less restricted, tolerant clones appear to postpone tissue 

dehydration to a remarkable greater extent than sensitive clones [11]. Thus, in addition to 

possessing a deeper root system, the tolerant clones might also deplete accessible soil water 

more sparingly than the drought-sensitive clones. These features may contribute to buffer crop 

yield of the tolerant clones when compared with the sensitive clones in drought-prone areas 

[Romário Ferrão, personal communication].

3.2. Responses to paraquat-mediated oxidative stress 

Paraquat was used in order to test the hypothesis that clones of Robusta coffee considered 

to be drought-tolerant would have higher inherent ability to cope with oxidative stress than 

clones considered to be drought-sensitive. As deduced from the decreases in Fv/Fm ratio (Fig. 

1), clones 14 and 46 suffered from a similar oxidative stress, regardless of the paraquat 

concentration employed. At 5 µM paraquat, clones 109A and 120 were better protected 

against paraquat than clones 14 and 46. However, defence mechanisms were not as effective 

in clone 109A as in clone 120 since Fv/Fm decreased further in the former, but not in clone 

120, as paraquat concentration was increased from 5 to 15 µM. As a whole, no clear 

distinction concerning differential tolerance to paraquat between drought-sensitive and 

drought-tolerant clones could be established. However, defence mechanisms to scavenge ROS 

were comparatively more effective in clone 120, affording better protection to its 

photosynthetic apparatus against oxidative stress. 

 

3.3. Photosynthetic parameters 

With the exception of clone 120, drought led to approximately parallel decreases in both gs 

and A, 81 and 75% for clone 14, 93 and 83% for clone 46, and 58 and 51% for clone 109A, 

respectively. However, Ci/Ca did not decrease accordingly (Table 2). This could mean a 

higher inhibition of photosynthesis by non-stomatal factors than by stomatal ones. It is

unlikely that Ci has been overestimated as a result of patchy stomatal closure since (i) water 

deficit was imposed slowly and (ii) coffee behaves as a homobaric species and, therefore, 

heterogeneous stomatal closure is not to be expected [7]. In contrast, in clone 120 gs 

decreased to a greater extent than A (respectively 73 and 40%), which was accompanied by a 

significant decrease (14%) in Ci/Ca (Table 2). Thus it may be proposed that stomatal 

limitations rather than stress-induced dysfunctions at the chloroplast level accounted largely 

for the reductions in A in clone 120.

In spite of the strong decreases in A, only minor changes in photochemical parameters 

were observed in drought-stressed plants (Table 2), as already shown for Robusta coffee 

[9,14]. In clone 14, a slight decline (35%) in ?PSII was greatly associated with decreased 

availability of electron acceptors downstream of PSII, as deduced from the 29% reduction in 

qP. In clone 120, only a discrete depression (28%) in thermal energy dissipation, analysed as 

NPQ, was found. Overall, the present results indicate that electron transport under drought 

stress was maintained, similarly as in control plants. Since photosynthetic CO2 fixation 

declined sharply, a surplus of excitation light energy should have occurred, which could 

potentially lead to photoinhibition and photodamage. However, PE increased significantly 

(34%) only in clone 14. Because treatment effect on Fv/Fm was not found (suggesting that 

photoinhibition did not occur) and leaf gas exchange and photochemical parameters returned 

to control levels rapidly upon rewatering (measured 12 h latter; data not shown), it may be 

suggested that drought stress in this experiment did not cause a long-term effect on the 

photosynthetic apparatus. In any case, since electron transport continued at high rates in 

drought-stressed plants, an increase in the capacity of alternative electron acceptor routes such 

as photorespiration and Mehler-peroxidase pathway is to be expected [2,5,10]. 

 

3.4. Drought-induced defence mechanisms against oxidative stress 

Under drought conditions, SOD activity was not induced in clones 14 and 46, but increased 

about 45% in clones 109A and 120, as compared with control plants (Fig. 2). This increase 

leads to enhanced production of H2O2 [6,10]. Thus in clone 109A, the possible H2O2 build-up 

could be attended by increases in activities of APX (45%), CAT (74%) and GPX (43%) (Fig. 

3). By contrast, protection against oxidative stress mediated by SOD might be at first glance 

limited in clone 120 since no co-ordinate increase in H2O2 scavenging system was observed 

(Fig. 3). However, there was no apparent oxidative damage in clone 120, conversely to what 

happened in clone 109A (see below). 

Non-SOD scavenging of O2
·— may also occur through direct reactions with Asc or GSH 

[6,10]. This suggests that non-enzymatic O2
·— removal might be possible, particularly in 

clones 14 and 46 in which SOD activity was not induced by drought. Since this alternative 

pathway also leads to H2O2 production, corresponding increases in antioxidants and/or 

enzymes involved in H2O2 removal are to be expected [22]. In clone 14 of the six enzymes 

herein evaluated involved in post-SOD reactions only APX, which has a much higher affinity 

for H2O2 than either CAT or GPX, increased (38%) as a result of drought (Fig. 3). This

evidences a key role of APX in allowing the clone 14 to cope with potential increases in H2O2 

under drought conditions. With regard to clone 46, besides APX, other enzymes (CAT, GPX 

and possibly GR) were affected by drought (Fig. 3) in order to control H2O2 levels. However, 

it should be pointed out that only measurements of metabolic fluxes across biochemical 

pathways could provide evidence for an imbalance between production and assimilation of 

H2O2. In any case, although analyses in vitro of the enzyme activities do not allow assessment

of the actual activities in vivo, they do reflect the potential and, thus, the capacity for the use 

of different substrates. 

Changes in APX were not accompanied by alterations in MDAR (Fig. 3B), while DHAR 

tended to increase in response to drought, but only in clone 109A it increased (55%) 

significantly (Fig. 3C). GR activity increased (67%, clone 46), decreased (48%, clone 120) or 

remained unaffected (clones 14 and 109A) in drought-stressed plants when compared with 

irrigated ones (Fig. 3D). In addition, maximal extractable activities of MDAR, DHAR and GR 

were considerably lower than that of APX (Fig. 3). When taken together, these data support 

the hypothesis that direct photoreduction of MDA (probably by ferredoxin), which is formed 

upon peroxidation of Asc, has predominated over enzymatic routes. Similar assumptions have 

been reported for other species [23,24,25]. 

Differences in Asc levels were not significant among clones regardless of the watering 

regime (Fig. 4A). Drought caused a decrease in DHA in clone 46 (data not shown) and, as a 

result, an increase in Asc redox state (Asc/Asc + DHA) was only observed in this clone (Fig. 

4B). In clone 109A, drought induced an 18% increase in lipid peroxidation (estimated as 

MAld), but not in the other clones. Also, absolute values of MAld in clone 109A were about 

34% larger than those averaged over the drought-stressed plants of the other clones (Fig. 4C). 

This could be an indication that leaf tissues from clone 109A suffered from oxidative stress. 

By contrast, acclimatory changes in antioxidant system appeared to be sufficient to prevent 

oxidative damages in the other clones investigated. 

It was previously demonstrated that rapid imposition of water deficit (predawn ?w = –3.0 

MPa) in clones 109A and 120 resulted in considerable increases in some antioxidant enzyme 

activities, especially in clone 120 (e.g. 2- and 5.6-fold for SOD in clones 109A and 120, 

respectively), but changes in enzyme activities did not prevent cellular damages, particularly 

in clone 109A [9]. The present results indicate that, if water deficit proceeds slowly, the 

coffee plants can acclimate to drought and, as a consequence, they could largely avoid 

oxidative stress. This is in agreement with the fact that plants are more tolerant of a water 

shortage when the stress is imposed gradually [26,27]. 

 

 

4. Conclusions 

Under the experimental conditions, drought-tolerant clones were better able to maintain 

their leaf water status than drought-sensitive clones after withholding irrigation. In part, this 

might be associated with a deep root system in the former. Induction of defence mechanisms 



 

 44

against oxidative stress triggered by drought was greater in drought-sensitive than in drought-

tolerant clones. This might be an indication of increased oxidative processes suffered by the 

sensitive clones. However, there was no apparent link between oxidative damage with 

differences in clonal tolerance to drought. For example, no clear distinction between the 

drought-tolerant clone 14 and the drought-sensitive clone 46, in terms of defence mechanisms 

to cope with oxidative stress, could be established. Clone 120 showed a comparatively more 

tolerant photosynthetic apparatus to both drought and paraquat-mediated oxidative stress. The 

data presented allow other physiological insight into high degree of drought tolerance in 

Robusta coffee [8,28] taking into consideration that no long-term effect of drought on the 

photosynthetic apparatus had occurred; additionally, the clones herein investigated were able 

to preserve, or even to increase, their antioxidant defences at ?w as low as –3.5 MPa.

GENERAL CONCLUSIONS 

 

 

Clonal ability to postpone dehydration was more important than dehydration tolerance. 

Overall, this was associated with (i) strong stomatal sensitivity to soil drying and, to a lesser 

extent, with leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficit; (ii) increases in leaf carbon isotope 

composition in stressed plants, suggesting higher water-use efficiency; and (iii) relatively high 

modulus of elasticity. The clone 109A, although possessing greater root to shoot mass ratio, is 

shallow-rooted and showed a relatively poor stomatal control on transpiration; these features 

could explain why it experienced symptoms of drought stress earlier after suspending 

irrigation. The clone 46 is also shallow-rooted but exhibited a better stomatal sensitivity to 

both soil and atmospheric drought; hence the clone 46 was better able to delay dehydration 

than the clone 109A. Similarly to clone 46, stomatal sensitivity to drought was well developed 

in clones 14 and 120, but these clones showed a remarkably deeper root system than the 

drought-sensitive clones, which could explain their better avoidance to drought. In any case, 

the larger soil-to-leaf hydraulic conductance in clone 14 might be involved in the slower 

decrease in its predawn xylem pressure potential than in the clone 120. The prompt recovery 

of water potential, stomatal conductance and soil-to-leaf hydraulic conductance following re-

watering, altogether with the remarkable stomatal sensibility to soil drought, should explain 

greatly why robusta coffee responses strongly to irrigation. 

Induction of defence mechanisms against oxidative stress triggered by drought was greater 

in drought-sensitive than in drought-tolerant clones. This might be an indication of increased 

oxidative processes suffered by the sensitive clones. However, there was no apparent link 

between oxidative damage with differences in clonal tolerance to drought. For example, no 

clear distinction between the drought-tolerant clone 14 and the drought-sensitive clone 46, in 

terms of defence mechanisms to cope with oxidative stress, could be established. Overall, the 

present data lend support to explain the high degree of drought tolerance in robusta coffee 

taking into consideration that no long-term effect of drought on the photosynthetic apparatus 

had occurred. Additionally, the clones herein investigated were able to preserve, or even to 



 

 48

increase, their antioxidant defences at water potentials as low as –3.5 MPa. In any case, clonal 

differences in drought tolerance in robusta coffee should be greatly determined by the 

combination of mechanisms that effectively postpone dehydration and, associated with deep 

root systems, they should contribute to survival and/or stability of crop yield of drought-

tolerant clones in regions with unpredictable rainfall. Attributes such as osmotic and elastic 

adjustments and protection against oxidative damage induced by drought are unlikely to be of 

major importance to drought tolerance in this specie.
