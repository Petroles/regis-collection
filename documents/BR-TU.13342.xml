resumo 

 

 

As microagulhas (MN) são microcomponentes inovadores na entrega de 

fármacos via transdérmica de forma quase impercetível para o paciente. De 

metais a polímeros, as MN têm sido fabricadas com uma grande variedade de 

materiais, embora com algumas restrições quanto à resistência mecânica 

(limitações relacionadas com a perfuração da pele), armazenamento e altos 

custos de fabrico. 

Na presente tese, foram utilizados cimentos à base de fosfato tricálcico (TCP) 

para o fabrico de MN brushíticas e apatíticas via micromoldagem. Foram 

sintetizados dois pós, ?-TCP e ?BTCP (bifásico, ?-TCP + ?-TCP). Partindo 

destes pós, foram preparadas pastas cimentícias na ausência e na presença de 

fármaco, variando a razão líquido/pó e caracterizadas em termos de tempos de 

presa inicial e final, parâmetros importantes para o enchimento e desmoldagem 

dos componentes. Os cimentos resultantes foram caracterizados em termos de 

porosidade, fases cristalinas, resistência mecânica, microestrutura da superfície 

e metodologia de secagem. As formulações de cimento que apresentaram os 

resultados mais promissores para o fabrico de MN foram utilizadas para estudar 

a taxa de libertação do fármaco. Uma solução aquosa de ácido cítrico com 

concentração adequada como líquido de presa revelou ser a mais adequada. O 

antibiótico levofloxacina (LEV) foi utilizado como fármaco modelo.  

Os resultados obtidos mostraram que a adição de LEV aumenta os tempos de 

presa iniciais e finais das pastas cimentícias e diminui as propriedades 

mecânicas dos cimentos. Uma libertação de fármaco de 100% foi alcançada 

para todas as formulações de cimento testadas após 48 horas de imersão. Do 

estudo cinético da libertação de fármaco verificou-se que o "Coupled 

Mechanism" foi o que melhor descreveu o mecanismo de libertação da LEV em 

todas as formulações de cimentos testadas. Com as pastas cimentícias foi 

possível obter microagulhas afiadas por enchimento de micromoldes e 

devidamente desmoldadas. Através da avaliação da sua resistência mecânica é 

possível prever que as MN obtidas apresentam estrutura e propriedades 

mecânicas adequadas para a perfuração da pele, uma vez que, é conhecido da 

literatura que a força necessária para que as agulhas perfurarem a pele humana 

é à volta de 1-5 N. Das várias agulhas testadas, os valores da força necessária 

para quebrar a ponta situam-se num intervalo de 57 a 110 N.  

As MN à base de cimentos de TCP apresentam características adequadas para 

serem utilizadas como meio de administração de fármacos via transdérmica com 

futuro em diversas aplicações médicas. O processo de produção utilizado traz 

imensas vantagens quando comparado com os métodos atuais para a produção 

de microcomponentes, sendo simples, económico e replicável.

abstract 

 

Microneedles (MN) are an up and coming technology offering almost 

inconspicuous transdermal drug delivery system. From metals to polymers, 

microneedles have been fabricated with a high variety of materials, although with 

some constraints regarding mechanical strength (limitations related to skin 

perforation), storage and high manufacturing costs.  

In the present thesis, self-setting bioceramics were used to fabricate brushitic

and apatitic MN by micro-molding casting. Two precursor powders were 

synthesized to obtain ?-TCP and BTCP (biphasic,??-TCP+?-TCP) as main 

phases. Cement pastes were prepared in absence and in presence of drug, 

varying liquid to powder ratio and characterized in terms of initial and final setting 

times, important parameters for casting and de-molding procedures. The

resulting cements were characterized for their porosity, crystalline phases, 

mechanical strength, surface morphology and drying methodology. The cement 

formulations that presented the most promising results for MN fabrication

(flowability during casting and adequate mechanical properties for de-molding 

without damage) were used to study drug release rate. A citric acid solution with 

adequate concentration was the most suitable as setting liquid in both MN types. 

The antibiotic levofloxacin was used as a model drug.  

The results show that the addition of levofloxacin increases the setting times of 

the cement pastes and decreases the mechanical properties of the cements. A 

100% drug release was achieved for all the tested cement formulations after 48

hours of immersion time. The drug release kinetics were evaluated being 

determined that the "coupled mechanism" is the one that best described the 

release mechanism of cements obtained from both powders. Sharp MN were 

successfully casted and de-molded. MN tip obtained in this work present 

adequate mechanical properties for skin perforation without breakage, since 

according to literature the insertion forces necessary for perforate human skin is

around 1-5 N. Among all tested MN, the force necessary to break the tip is in the 

range 57 to 110 N.   

From the evaluated work, calcium phosphate cement based MN present 

adequate characteristics to be used as a promising drug delivery

microcomponent for biomedical applications. The fabrication process used 

(micromolding) has several advantages when compared to the current 

production MN processes being simple, cost-effective and replicable.

Background and context

Ever since man discovered ways to treat illness in its many forms. The way how such 

treatments are applied is of major importance and directly affects the body’s response, 

either positively or negatively. As so, the interest in discovering new ways to deliver 

chemicals as grown alongside the advances in drug discovery. The effectiveness of a drug 

and how it behaves in the body is directly related to the way it is delivered. 

Traditionally, medicines (meaning drugs) are delivered to the body via one of  two 

major forms: orally, with pills and syrups, and directly in the bloodstream, via 

hypodermic needles [1]. When using the oral method, drugs must pass through the 

digestive system, which can lead to a change in the drug’s composition (or even loss) due 

to the gastric juices and metabolization by the liver [2]. During the delivery and diffusion 

process drug integrity must be guaranteed, as well as, it side effects that can affect the 

digestive system and it behavior in such environment [2]. 

The use of hypodermic needles (being subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular 

or intradermal) eliminate such problems, bypassing completely the digestive system, 

delivering the drug directly to the bloodstream. When choosing this delivery method 

several factors should be considered such as, the emotional trauma and pain associated 

with injections, the risk of needle-related injuries, patient compliance and even the safe 

disposal of the needles [3]. In addition, the administration of the injection requires special 

training and expertise. 

Transdermal drug delivery (Transdermal Drug Delivery System, TDDS), a topic 

that as gain a lot of attention in the past years, appears as a valid alternative to the 

traditional methods, providing control over the rate of drug release. TDDS is a system 

that can provide what the other two methods cannot: it bypasses the digestive system and 

it does not have the same disadvantages of hypodermic injections. Besides, the skin 

contains a large number of antigen-presenting cells (i.e., Langerhans cells and dermal 

dendritic cells), becoming a suitable way for drug delivery [6-8].  Drug patches and 

microneedles (MN) have been both thoroughly investigated [2, 3]. The first transdermal 

system for systemic delivery was approved for use in the United States in 1979, a three-

day patch that delivers scopolamine to treat motion sickness [7]. Ten years later, nicotine 

patches become the first transdermal blockbuster, raising awareness to the transdermal 

delivery in medicine and for the general public [4, 5]. The main difference between the 

two types of transdermal delivery systems is that patches are limited to a restrict amount 

and nature of drugs, while MN are compatible with a wide range of drugs being also more

efficient in the delivery process [1]. Instead of relying on skin permeability, MNs 

physically introduce the drug into the body, accessing the epidermal and the top of the 

dermal layer of the skin. This is of major importance, as it means that the microneedles 

are short enough to avoid the nerve endings, causing no pain. The dimensions of MNs are 

lower than 1500 micrometer in length and, in the range of 50-250 and 10-25 micrometers 

in width and tip diameter, respectively. 

Besides the above mentioned, MNs provide a number of other advantages: (i) 

lower concentrations can be used since the drug release is controlled, providing a precise 

dosage; (ii) it’s a method that requires no special qualifications for administration, 

opening the way to auto-administration; (iii) due to its micrometric size, can be produced 

in large quantities, reducing the manufacturing cost and; (iv) provides total release of the 

drug maintaining its stability, among others [9, 10]. 

Three major types of MN are commonly described in the literature, depending on 

the drug and application: solid (which include coated and dissolving microneedles), 

hollow and porous [10]. Besides that, MN based material has also a significant influence 

on their effectiveness. Several materials are already used to produce MNs, including 

biodegradable polymers [11], metals [12], soluble sugars [13], glasses and ceramics [14]. 

Polymeric MN are easily shaped but have a low mechanical strength [4], whereas metallic 

MN have a high production cost and could have compatibility issues with the drug. 

Therefore, finding a material that can be tailored to better suit the desired characteristics 

and properties while reducing production cost, is still required. 

Ceramic materials appear as a new alternative to the existing options. Properties 

such as high mechanical strength, biocompatibility, and reusability (ceramic materials 

can sustain high temperatures without deformation, so sterilization is a viable option) are 

of interest and draw increasing attention to the use of ceramic materials in the production 

of MNs. Research conducted by Luttge et al. showed promising results in the 

development of ceramic nanoporous microneedle arrays (npMNAs) for the controlled 

release of drugs and vaccines [4]. In this study, alumina based npMNAs have been 

prepared by micromolding followed by sintering at 1500 ºC [15] to create nanoporosity. 

The authors showed that drug nanoparticles up to 100 nm can be loaded into the npMNAs 

and released with success in 30 minutes upon incubation in PBS [4]. Since drug loading 

in npMNAs is evaluated after sintering, the amount of drug absorbed is dependent on the 

pore size and pore size distribution and surface absorption capacity of the npMNAs. 



Background and context

Finding a manufacturing process where the drug could be added during casting process 

could be highly advantageous.  

In fact, ceramic-based components are commonly submitted to a sintering step, 

where the material is thermal treated at high temperatures (?1000ºC), to create a 

mechanically strong solid. Besides increasing the manufacturing costs, sintering step 

avoids the incorporation of pharmaceuticals during processing, since drug molecules 

cannot withstand such high temperatures. To overcome this, the sintering step must be 

eliminated in order to fabricate ceramic materials capable of incorporating 

pharmaceuticals, while retaining its mechanical strength and drug delivery capabilities. 

In a recent study evaluated by B.Cai et al. [16], self-setting bioceramics were introduced 

as an alternative to the above ceramics. By eliminating the sintering step, the damage 

caused to the loaded drugs by the high temperatures was avoided, while maintaining the 

required mechanical strength in order to pierce skin. Brushitic microneedles loaded with 

Zolpidem tartrate to treat insomnia were successfully prepared by micromolding. Being 

a first-of-its-kind essay involving self-setting ceramic microneedles as a vehicle for 

controlled drug delivery, this study opens new opportunities for advacing with research 

in self-setting MN. Although being an innovative work, several questions need to be 

answered in what concerns manufacturing costs, formulations and real world day-to-day 

viability. 

Thus, the present work will try and shed some light on the subject, exploring the 

production and characterization of apatitic and brushitic calcium phosphate porous 

microneedles and how they behave as a controlled delivery system of an antibiotic 

(levofloxacin).

1. Theoretical Introduction 

1.1 - The skin 

The human body is a complex system composed of different organs and systems. The 

human skin is the largest organ of the integumentary system (organ system composed by the 

skin, hair and nails) composed of up to seven layers of ectodermal tissue that guards the 

underlying bones, ligaments, muscles and internal organs, as well as, several structures called 

appendages (hair follicles and glands). Surrounding all the human body, the skin is the interface 

with this environment, playing an important role in immunity and protecting the body against 

pathogens and excessive water loss. Other functions include insulation, temperature regulation, 

sensation, synthesis of vitamin D and regeneration. This system can be divided into two types 

of skin: hairy skin (with hair follicles and sebaceous glands) and glabrous skin (a skin type on 

the palms and soles and lacks hair follicles). 

1.1.1 - Structure of the skin 

Three layers of the skin can be recognized: epidermis, dermis and hypodermis, as illustrated in 

Figure 1. A healthy interaction between the layers is important for the maintenance of 

homeostasis in the adult. In this section, each layer will be considered separately.   

Epidermis 

The epidermis is the outer most layer of the skin (50 to 100 ?m) that is divided into the 

following sublayers (Figure 2), from top to bottom [17]: 

Figure 1- Cross-section of the skin, showing it 3 main layers, as well as, some of its 
constituents. 



Chapter 1: Theoretical Introduction

 Stratum corneum (SC): consisting of mainly keratinocytes (approximately 90-95% of 

epidermal cells) containing a protein known as keratin. The thick layer (10 to 20 ?m thick) 

provides a major barrier against water loss and permeation of environmental substances, as 

well as contributing to mechanical protection; 

 Stratum lucidum: this sublayer is present in the thick skin of palms and soles and 

consists of a thick layer of dead cells, functioning as a barrier and having water proof 

properties; 

 Stratum granulosum: also known as the granular layer, mainly consists of stratified cells 

arranged in one to three rows. Besides the palms and soles, the skin lacks a well-defined stratum 

lucidum and stratum granulosum; 

 Stratum spinosum: formed by cuboidal cells arranged in multiple layers, it has the 

capability to synthesize keratin; 

Stratum basale or Stratum germinatum: this sublayer consists of tall columnar cells that 

are constantly undergoing cell division and help form new keratinocytes that will replace the 

dead ones form the stratum corneum.  

This outmost layer of the skin contains no blood vessels, so cell nutrition is made almost 

exclusively by diffused oxygen from the surrounding air and, to a slighter degree, by blood 

capillaries extending to the outer layer of the dermis. Merkel cells and keratinocytes are the 

main type of cells which make up the Epidermis, with melanocytes (pigment producing cells) 

and Langerhans cells (dendritic immune cells) also presented [18].

Epidermis 



Chapter 1: Theoretical Introduction

Dermis 

The dermis or corium is a thick layer of skin (1 to 2 mm) that lies between the epidermis 

and subcutaneous layer, sustaining and supporting the epidermis. It is composed of two 

sublayers, the more superficial papillary dermis and the deeper reticular dermis. The papillary 

dermis consists of loose connective tissue containing capillaries, elastic fibers, reticular fibers 

and some collagen. The reticular dermis consists of a thicker layer of dense connective tissue 

containing larger blood vessels, closely interlaced elastic fibers and bundles of collagen fibers 

arranged in layers parallel to the surface. The deep surface of the dermis is highly irregular and 

borders the subcutaneous layer, which additionally cushions the skin [19]. 

 

Hypodermis 

Also known as the subcutaneous tissue, this layer lies below the dermis and serving as 

a connection to the underlying bone and muscle, supplies the upper layers with blood vessels 

and nerves and insulates the body. Consists mainly of loose connective tissue and elastin, 

allowing for its mobility over underlying structures [17]. 

 

1.1.2 - Permeability of the skin 

A variety of different compounds gets into contact with the skin every day, through the 

use of household chemicals, application of cosmetics or pharmaceutical products or even by 

accident. Some of those chemicals may be absorbed or facilitate the absorption of other kinds 

of harmful components. 

The stratum corneum (SC), being the outmost layer of the epidermis, acts like a barrier 

preventing the penetration of molecules to the lower layers [18]. The SC is often compared to 

a brick wall [20], where  the corneocytes (keratinocytes) are like  the “bricks” and the layers of 

lipids between the cells like the “mortar”. This lipidic “mortar” layer is released by the 

keratinocytes, filling the gaps between them and preventing water from passing through. The 

very specialized “bricks and mortar”, work together to produce a layer that is both flexible and 

protective [21, 22]. Some molecules, like lipid soluble molecules, are able to diffuse through 

the lipid “mortar”, bypassing the barrier, but that’s not the case for all molecules. Delivery of 

a drug or a cosmetic into and through the skin involves a number of steps including release 

from the vehicle, partition into the skin and subsequent movement through the SC [23]. A 



Chapter 1: Theoretical Introduction 
 
 

9 
 

complete agreement still does not exist on whether lipid layers or corneocytes are the main 

contributor to the permeability barrier [24]. Penetration studies and mathematical models [24-

29] have demonstrated that the SC behaves like a passive diffusion barrier, being necessary 

additional chemicals to facilitate the diffusion though this layer, as the diffusion rate is highly 

dependent on the molecular weight and lipophilicity of the molecules [25]. Alternatively, 

mechanical penetration of the upper layer of the skin bypasses this problem. However other 

different problems arise related to the vehicle of delivery, its resistance, composition, 

biocompatibility, and general discomfort related to the application.  

 

1.1.3 - Mechanical properties of the skin  

The mechanical and biomechanical properties of the skin are of extremely importance 

to its health and disease, structural integrity, and aging. Studies about this subject began in the 

19th century [30], further underlying its importance. Investigations in the fields of plastic 

surgery [31-33], skin cancer [34-36], cosmetics [37-39] and skin aging [40,41] further 

contributed to the understanding of the biomechanical properties of the skin. 

Optical coherence electrography (OCE), also known as Optical coherence tomography 

(OCT) has been used to deduce mechanical properties in tissues [42, 43]. Introduced by Schmitt 

in 1944 [44], this technique was first used to assess the tissue biomechanics through the 

measurement of localized deformation and strain inside a sample. Further advances [45-48] 

enabled OCE to assess and extract different parameters of the tissue deformation with high 

accuracy and to reconstruct the tissue’s biomechanical properties [49]. In a study evaluated  by 

Xing Liang and Boppart, OCE was used to determine the mechanical properties of the skin 

under different conditions (normal, hydrated and dehydrated), revealing that the stratum 

corneum has a Young modulus of 101.20 kPa for normal skin, 21.01 kPa for hydrated skin and 

300.41 kPa for dehydrated skin, confirming that the mechanical strength of the skin is directly 

correlated to its hydration [31]. 

 

1.1.4 - Skin Penetration 

Knowing the mechanical properties of the skin is of the upmost importance when drug 

delivery is done through the skin. As mentioned above, the stratum corneum acts as a barrier 

that needs to be penetrated to efficiently deliver pharmaceuticals to the bloodstream. Structures

like microneedle arrays, made from different materials, can be used to pierce the skin 

effectively [50]. The force needed to achieve this is a subject that has been investigated [51], 

being a parameter that not only affects the penetration depth but also the force that an array can 

handle.  

In the study presented by Ryan F. Donnelly et al. [52], OCT was used for the first time 

to investigate the effect of a microneedle (MN) geometry and applied force upon penetration 

into neonatal porcine skin in vitro using poly(methylvinylether-co-maleic anhydride) 

(PMVE/MA) MNs. The research work shows that MN height can influence the extent of drug 

delivery across the skin and that higher application force corresponds to a higher penetration 

depth, as expected.  

Romgens et al [53] monitored both the penetration depth and force of single solid 

microneedles with various tip diameters. The authors shown that sharp microneedles are 

essential to insert them in a well-controlled way to a desired depth. 

Shape, geometry, tip diameter, mechanical strength and based materials are all parameters 

that need to be considered in order to create a device that can easily deliver pharmaceuticals 

through the skin. Microneedles appear as a suitable solution for transdermal drug delivery [9, 

54-56], as discussed in the next section. 

 

1.2 - Microneedles  

For many years, hypodermic needles have been the most used technique for transdermal 

drug delivery. However, recent discoveries and advances in the biotechnology field showed 

that this delivery system has several limitations and disadvantages [11, 16]. As soon as new 

ways to fabricate microneedles for transporting nano-size molecules are discovered, the use of 

hypodermic needles could be discarded for certain applications, since they cause discomfort 

and limit the range of delivery.  

Microneedles can be divided in three categories: solid microneedles, hollow 

microneedles and porous microneedles, as schematically shown in Figure 3. In turn, solid 

microneedles include: (i) the ones used to create porosity in the skin prior to drug 

administration, (ii) drug-coated solid microneedles where the drug is dissolved by the skin and 

the MN patch subsequently removed, and (iii) dissolving MN where complete patch containing 

drug molecules is adsorbed by the sky. Hollow Microneedles are considered the most 



Chapter 1: Theoretical Introduction 
 
 

11 
 

challenging ones in terms of fabrication, due to the presence of a fine hole (50-100 ?m) in their 

middle, and can be used to deliver liquid-like drugs.  In porous MN, drug is usually captured 

in the pores and released by diffusion mechanisms after skin penetration [10]. 

This work, will be essentially focused on porous microneedles, its composition, 

geometries, fabrication methods and applications. 

 

1.2.1 - Solid microneedles  

1.2.1.1 - Materials used in the fabrication of solid microneedles 

One of the first strategies for the transdermal drug delivery is based on the use of solid 

MNs, where the microneedle array is first applied to the skin, creating micro-channels that 

allow the subsequently application of the drug [10]. However, some limitations of this method 

are clear: (1) a two-step process is needed, which may lead to practicality issues to the end user, 

(2) limited to certain type of drugs (usually cosmetics), between others. 

Several materials have been used to produce MNs capable of transdermal drug delivery. 

Considering solid MNs, silicon [58], metals, polymers [59] and ceramics [19, 20] have been 

used as based materials. While being a high throughput manufacturing method, 

microfabrication methods for most of the MNs (silicon, metals, polymers based) are often 

expensive, highly specialized and include complex multi-step processes [11, 21]. Standard 

Figure 3- Different types of microneedles according to their structure and drug delivery 
mechanisms [4]. 



Chapter 1: Theoretical Introduction 
 
 

12 
 

metals usually utilized in the medical practice, such as stainless steel and titanium, have also 

been used as structural materials for solid MN fabrication [22-25], mainly because such 

materials should not raise any issues of safety, facilitating the regulatory pathway to 

commercial acceptance.  Polymers are a viable alternative when compared to metals or silicon, 

although mechanical properties are usually poor.    

Developing a complex structure in the micrometer scale such as a microneedle array is 

not an easy task. Furthermore, obtaining MN patches at an affordable cost implies the use of 

cost-efficient manufacturing processes. Among the high tech processes used in microneedle 

manufacture, such as, laser cutting [66], lithography [67] and wet and dry etching [68], micro 

molding is the most explored one for MN fabrication [69]. However, as in all replication 

methods, the first and most crucial step is to create a master structure, to obtain the mold 

(usually PDMS, polydimethylsiloxane, based) where the desired structure will be shaped. 

Although the requirements for the master structure differ with respect to the physical 

parameters of the chosen replication method, four basic statements are common [69]:  

(a) The geometrical replication result can only be as good (or as bad) as the geometrical 

accuracy of the master; 

(b) For the ability to separate mold and molded part (demolding step), no undercuts in the 

structure itself can be allowed; 

(c) The surface roughness of the master should be as low as possible; 

(d) A suitable interface chemistry between master and substrate must be chosen. 

The prevailing technique used for fabricating PDMS devices involves master creation 

by a process called photolithography [70], which is a time consuming, multi-step and expensive 

process that needs to be carried out in a clean environment. While mold replication from the 

master could be an easy and costly efficient process, master fabrication involves the use of 

expensive advanced processing technologies. Eliminating the need for a master in micro 

molding fabrication could steeply decrease the total cost of the fabrication process, as well as 

its complexity. Hamsapriya et al. [71] published a study reporting the use of laser pulses to 

directly fabricate 2D and 3D structures in micro-scale on PDMS. Using a short pulse-to-pulse 

laser capable of achieving localized rapid heating (femtosecond laser) directly on thin PDMS 

layer, Hamsapriya et al. created a single-step masterless fabrication of PDMS microstructures.  

Taking advantage of casting techniques in PDMS micro molding, ceramics have been 

recently explored for MN fabrication [15, 60, 61, 72]. Gel casting was mentioned in literature 



Chapter 1: Theoretical Introduction 
 
 

13 
 

as a capable technique to fabricate this kind of micro components with complex geometries 

and dimensions lower that 1 mm [26, 27]. For that, ceramic suspensions parameters, such as 

solids loading, pH [74], surface chemistry [75] and interactions between ceramic particles with 

the dispersing agent [76] are of major importance and need to be precisely controlled in order 

to obtain the desired MN properties [60]. While in gel casting process of macro components, 

different gelling agents can be used, for micro component fabrication specific requirements 

should be addressed. The system “epoxy resin plus hardener”, presented by Olhero et al. [60], 

has been proved to be adequate to obtain low viscosity suspensions during mold casting, to 

guarantee complete filling of the microparts, as well as high green strength (around 35 MPa) 

to de-mold them without damaging. Olhero et al.[60], highlighted for the first time, the 

relevance of the specific interactions between processing additives and oxide particles having 

different surface chemistries (alumina, silica and zirconia) in determining the kinetics of curing 

and the properties of green bodies consolidated by Epoxy Gel Casting (EGC) process. The 

work developed by Olhero et al. demonstrated that EGC is a promising technology for the 

microfabrication of ceramic components with complex shapes and sharp features, opening a 

new way for fast replicating and cost-efficient production of MN.  Since ceramic MN obtained 

by this method should be sintered after de-molding, EGC was considered a promising 

technique for fabrication hollow ceramic microneedles for drugs administration in liquid form. 

 

1.2.1.2 - Self setting ceramic MN 

Even if ceramics could have some advantages when compared to polymers for MN 

applications, sintering procedure make them less attractive, not only due to the increase of 

manufacturing costs but also to the limitation in drugs incorporation before this step. To 

overcome this restriction, self-setting ceramics appear as alternative materials. Developing 

solid MNs from calcium phosphate based cements is a new research field, with only one paper 

published about the subject till date [16] (from author knowledge). In this study, Bing Cai et 

al. [16] explored the use of self-setting bioceramics for drug delivery, using Zolpidem tartrate 

as a model drug. Self-setting microneedles were fabricated from calcium phosphate based 

cements under ambient conditions to minimize drug degradation during fabrication and to 

facilitate a higher drug loading capacity. The drug release study showed that the release rate 

from this type of MN array could be controlled by the bulk surface area, porosity and resorption 

rate of the ceramic needles. Moreover, the needles proved to be capable of piercing the stratum 

corneum of the porcine skin. Promising results were obtained with this study opening the 



Chapter 1: Theoretical Introduction

opportunity to deeply explore the fabrication of MN by self-setting ceramics and their 

capability to deliver drugs throughout the skin.

1.3 - Calcium phosphates 

Calcium phosphates (CaPs) are the most important inorganic constituents of biological 

hard tissues. In the form of carbonated hydroxyapatite, they are present in bone, teeth and 

tendons to give to these organs stability, hardness and function. Calcium phosphate crystals are 

also found in nature as mineral deposits in considerable amounts, growing over the years, 

sometimes in extreme conditions of pressure and temperature. In contrast, biologically formed 

calcium phosphates are often nanocrystals precipitated under mild conditions (ambient 

pressure, near room temperature) [77].  

Apart from calcium pyrophosphate (Ca2P2O7), most calcium phosphates, previously 

used in vivo as bone substitutes in various forms, were calcium orthophosphates (presence of 

the orthophosphate group PO43-), commonly named calcium phosphates (Table 1).

Among the numerous calcium phosphate compounds, only the precursor compounds used 

in this work will be referred and highlighted. 

MCPM is the most soluble and acid for almost all pH levels [78]. It can be obtained by 

chemical precipitation from highly acidic solutions at room temperature with a crystalline 

structure similar to thin blades [79]. At temperatures above 100 ºC, a water molecule is released 

and MCPM is transformed into MCPA (anhydrous monocalcium phosphate). Due to his acidity 

and solubility, MCPM is not biocompatible, although it can be used in combination with other 

basic calcium phosphates for the production of several calcium orthophosphate cements [78], 

[79]. 



Chapter 1: Theoretical Introduction 
 
 

16 
 

Many calcium phosphate cements (CPC) have been proposed as bone substitutes, some 

based on the use of tricalcium phosphate (Ca3(PO4)2, TCP) [80]. TCP has three polymorphs 

[81] depending on the temperature, The low temperature ?-TCP phase (rhombohedral structure 

- space group R3cH and theoretical density, 3.07 g.cm-3) is obtained by thermal decomposition 

at temperature above 700-800ºC [82] and is stable up to 1125ºC. Above this temperature, ?-

TCP is transformed with volumetric expansion into the monoclinic ?-TCP phase (theoretical 

density, 2.86 g cm-3), which has a complex crystal structure with the space group P21/a. ?-TCP 

is stable between 1125°C and around the temperature range of 1430ºC [83] - 1475 °C  (as 

shown in phase diagram of Figure 4), and it can be maintained at room temperature as a 

metastable phase.  

The ?´-TCP is stable above 1430°C – 1475ºC until the melting point of 1765ºC and is 

unable to survive quenching to room temperature [9-11].  

Phase transformation through thermal treatment is the most direct way of obtaining pure 

?-TCP from ?-TCP [84], but is also a challenging one. Small quantities of ?-TCP  [78-82] 

and/or HA [85-87] in the final product have been reported, resulting in non-pure, and therefore, 

unwanted biphasic composition. The presence of ?-TCP as second phase is attributed to a 

partial reversion during cooling of the already formed ?-TCP phase [88]. As the polymorphic

P=P2O5; Ap=apatite) according to Riboud-[150].

???-phase transformation is considered to be reconstructive  [85-87], the reverse ???-TCP 

transformation would require surpassing a considerable activation energy barrier to proceed 

[89]. Considering this, reverting ???-TCP should only be possible under a very slow cooling 

rate or a long dwell at a temperature below the transformation temperature. Rapid cooling 

techniques such as quenching [88-89] or a moderate to high cooling rate [89] (5ºC/min [92] 

and 10 ºC/min [93]) are suggested as a solution to maintain the desired ?-TCP purity.  

Besides the influence of temperature in phase conversion, some studies have showed 

that slight variations in Ca/P ratio (Ca/P=1.50) of TCP also affect ?-TCP purity, as shown in 

the phase diagram presented above (Figure 4). These variations lead to the formation of small 

amounts of HA (positive variation, Ca/P &gt; 1.50) or CPP (calcium pyrophosphate, negative 

variation, Ca/P &amp;lt;1.50), as seen in Figure 5. Minor amounts of CPP are known to strongly affect 

the ???-TCP phase transition, as shown by Bohner et al. [93],  Welch and Gutt [94], and more 

recently by Torres et al. [95]. Starting from a ?-TCP powder with a trace of CPP to obtain 

pure??-TCP powder is compromised, with strong possibility to have in the final product ?-TCP 

as secondary phase, which amount varies according to the cooling rate imposed on the 

calcination cycle. 

As shown by the work of Destainville et al. [96], a tight control over experimental 

conditions during the synthesis process, such as pH and temperature, greatly influence the 

resulting product. Figure 5 shows the Ca/P molar ratio versus the ripening time of powder 

synthesized at different temperature and pH values. For a temperature of 30ºC and pH 8, a Ca/P

&gt; 1.50 is obtained in the first 4 hours, insuring that no CPP is formed and the ???-TCP 

regression does not occur after thermal treatment. 

?-TCP and ?-TCP have been extensively used in medical applications due to the 

biodegradable and biocompatible properties [78, 97]. Considering its biological interactions, 

?-TCP is non-toxic, osteoconductive and bioactive. Although its biodegradability is higher than 

?-TCP and HA, it is less stable and as so, more reactive [98]. Calcium phosphates can also be 

categorized by one of their most important characteristics: solubility in aqueous medium. As 

so, depending on its chemical composition and porosity, CaPs can be organized by its 

degradability (ordered from more to less degradable) [78]: 

MCPM &gt; ?-TCP &gt; DCPD &gt; DCP &gt; ?-TCP &gt; HA 

Properties like tension, compression force and stress resistance are also parameters 

highly dependent on the chemical composition and the porosity of the material that influences 

also its applications [99]. 

 

1.3.1 - Calcium phosphate cements 

CPC’s were first discovered by Brown and Chow in the 1980’s [100]. Despite a large 

number of formulations, CPC are divided into two different end-products: apatite (CDHA) and 

brushite (DCPD) [78]. These synthetic biomaterials are formed from a mixture of a solid 

component and an aqueous solution, both reacting at room temperature to obtain a paste that 

contains one or more types of calcium phosphates [101], as summarized in the diagram 

presented in Figure 6 [102]. 

 

Figure 6- Preparation of a CPC. Adapted from: (Driessens, 1997) [102]. 



Chapter 1: Theoretical Introduction 
 
 

19 
 

 

After mixing powder with liquid, a plastic paste is obtained, increasing viscosity as 

setting time increases, losing its malleability and ability to deform. During setting reaction, the 

calcium phosphates dissolve and precipitate into a less soluble CaP phase(s). The precipitated 

CaP crystals grow and become entangled, providing rigidity to the cement [78]. The chemical 

reaction occurring during the setting times of the CPCs is highly dependent on its chemical 

composition, and can be divided into two main types of reactions [103]: 

(A) Acid-base reaction, as for example when the neutral ?-TCP reacts with the acidic 

MCPM forming DCPC, as shown below (equation 1): 

?-Ca3(PO4)2 (s)+ Ca(H2PO4).2H2O (s)+ 7H2O (l) – 4 CaHPO4.2H2O (s) (1) 

(B) Hydrolysis, when for example ?-TCP is mixed with an aqueous solution, forming 

CDHA, or calcium deficient hydroxyapatite (equation 2):  

3 ?-Ca3(PO4)2 (s) + H2O (l) – Ca9(HPO4)(PO4)5(OH) (s)    (2) 

 

1.3.2 - Apatite CPCs 

Since the discovery of CPCs [100], numerous formulations have been proposed. Most 

apatite CPC formulations have CDHA as the end-product of the reaction, having all of them a 

long intrinsic setting time [78]. The mechanical properties of the apatite CPC highly depend 

on its composition and can widely vary. The main factor is the ratio between the amount of 

setting liquid (L) and cement powder (P) that varies directly with the CPCs porosity (low L/P 

ratio results in low porosity), resulting in lower mechanical properties as the porosity increase. 

Considering the excellent biocompatibility of apatite CPCs, applications for drug delivery can 

be considered, as the CPC will not cause inflammatory response when in contact with skin 

[86]. 

 

1.3.3 - Brushite CPC 

DCPD is the product of the setting reaction of so-called brushite cements. These types 

of cements where introduced by Mirtchi and Lemaitre in 1987 [35, 36], where the DCPD is a 

result of the ?-TCP + MCPM reaction, as shown previously in equation (1). Several 



Chapter 1: Theoretical Introduction 
 
 

20 
 

formulations to obtain brushite cements have been proposed, such as ?-TCP + H3PO4 [97], 

[105] and ?-TCP + MCPM + CaO [106]. According to Bohner et at. [105], the first formulation 

has some advantages over the second one: (i) rapid and easy preparation, (ii) better control over 

the chemical composition and reactivity, and (iii) better physical and chemical properties such 

as enhanced setting times and better tension resistance [105]. 

All brushite CPC are obtained via acid-base reaction, meaning that the paste is acidic 

during the setting reaction, since brushite only precipitates around pH &amp;lt;6 [37, 39]. 

Brushite CPCs are biocompatible, bioabsorbable and rapidly degraded (in vivo 

conditions), due to their solubility [107] although the porosity has its influence. The high 

growth rate of the brushite crystals results in a low setting time, making it a material not suitable 

for certain clinical applications [108]. To somewhat compensate this flaw, additives such as 

citric acid [109] and glycolic acid [110], that inhibit the growth of DCPD crystal have been 

used to increase the setting time of the brushite CPCs.  According to Román et al. [111] the 

hardening reaction (the complete formation of the crystals) of brushite has the duration of 

around 24 hours, for a Ca/P of 1.50 and using citric acid as liquid phase, although having a 

high initial reactivity. This is probably due to the fact that, at the end of the setting reaction, 

the pH level of the mixture increases, which causes a decrease in the solubility of the reagents 

[97]. 

1.3.4 - Apatite CPCs vs Brushite CPCs 

Although both apatite and brushite cements are commercially available due to their 

usefulness for the reconstruction of bone defects, their behaviors in the bone defect are quite 

different especially in respect to resorption. Brushite cement resorbed much faster when 

compared to apatite one. This difference is caused by the compositional difference in the final 

products. As the name represents, final product of apatite cement is apatite, whereas final 

product of brushite cement is brushite being apatite the most thermodynamically stable phase 

at physiological conditions. Since the human body-fluid is supersaturated in ions of apatite 

phase, no physicochemical dissolution occurs in the case of the apatite cement (at physiological 

conditions) [112].  

Brushite is the most stable phase at pH values in the range of 2.0–4.2 being formed 

based on dissolution-precipitation reaction and entanglement of the brushite crystals during 

setting reaction. However, brushite is a metastable phase at physiological pH and dissolves 

upon exposure to the body fluid [112].

Nonetheless, brushite cement dissolves much faster than apatite cement. As an example, 

Apelt et al.[113] reported that brushite cement was used for the reconstruction of bone defects 

in sheep, and it almost completely resorbed after 6 months, whereas apatite cement did not 

show any notable change for the same time period [45, 46]. 

 

1.3.5 - Properties of the CPCs 

CPCs have wide range of properties that are tightly linked to several factors that can be 

tailored according to the application target, as shown in Table 2. The final properties of the 

CPCs depending highly on the composition of its solid phase, ratio of the components in the 

mixture, additives and particle size distribution of the powder.

Particle characteristics 

The particle characteristics of powder phase heavily influence initial and final 

properties of CPC. Particle size and size distribution, shape and specific surface area are the 

four major influences of powder phase on the behavior of the CPCs. Particle size is directly 

related to the setting time and consequently to the mechanical properties of the CPC. For a 

given liquid to powder ratio setting time decreases as particle size decreases, since smaller 

particles dissolve faster and the precipitation process of the new phase begins earlier [93]. 



Chapter 1: Theoretical Introduction

Liquid phase 

The liquid phase composition in a powder-liquid mixture is also an important factor that 

influences final CPCs properties. The liquid is a vehicle for the dissolution of the reagents and 

for the precipitation of the final products of the reaction. This aqueous phase can be just 

composed of distilled water or can contain many organic or inorganic additives that can be 

used to tailor CPCs properties. These additives can influence the setting time, rheological, 

cohesive properties and porosity of the paste/cement, for example: 

? Sodium hydrogenophosphate (Na2HPO4) [114]: accelerates the hardening process, 

lowering the setting times in apatitic cements; 

? Citric acid (C6H8O7)[109]: (1) slows the reaction time, increasing the setting time in 

brushitic cements; and (2) accelerates the hardening process in apatitic cements, 

decreasing the setting time. 

Liquid-to-powder ratio  

The liquid-to-powder ratio (L/P) is a very important parameter than can determine 

several properties of the cement [115], such as setting time [116,117], rheological 

behavior[115] and mechanical strength [98, 117]. Higher  L/P ratios lead to a decrease in 

mechanical strength and higher initial (IST) and final (FST) setting times, which can be 

explained by the increase in porosity caused by the higher amounts of liquid phase [98,117]. 

Setting time 

Setting time is defined as a specified time required for a paste/cement to change from 

liquid state to plastic state (initial setting time, IST) and plastic state to solid state (final setting 

time, FST), so that the surface becomes sufficiently rigid to withstand a defined amount of 

pressure [118]. It’s a continuous process that can be described in three steps [119]: 

1. Dissolution of the reagents; 

2. Nucleation of the newly formed crystals; 

3. Growth of the newly formed crystals. 

There are two methods used to determine IST and FST of a cement, the Gillmore needle 

test [Standard Test Method for Time of Setting of Hydraulic-Cement Paste by Gillmore 

Needles, ASTM C266-15] and the Vicat needle test [Standard Test Methods for Time of Setting 

of Hydraulic Cement by Vicat Needle, ASTM C191-13]. Both of these tests follow the same 

methodology, analyzing the surface of the cement to assess if the needle produces an indent 



Chapter 1: Theoretical Introduction 
 
 

23 
 

after contact [120]. The Gilmore needle test is more widely used, consisting of two different 

needles: (1) a thick and light needle to assess the IST and (2) a thin and heavy to determine the 

FST. The Vicat needle test, on the other hand, uses only one needle at a time to determine the 

IST or FST.  

Evaluating the setting times of a cement is essential to determine its handling time of a 

cement past. For the molding process, up until the IST, the cement is malleable, so it can be 

deformed and molded to a desired shape. When the compound is in the desired shape and the 

hardening process is yet to be completed, it cannot be handled without the risk of producing 

fractures along the structure. The FST indicates when the hardening process is finish and the 

sample can be handled without damaging it. As in other properties, setting time can be 

influenced by different factors of the mixture (liquid and solid phases) as well as ambient 

conditions [107]:  

i) Particle size; 

ii) Crystallinity; 

iii) Composition of the liquid phase; 

iv) Temperature; 

v) Liquid-to-powder ratio. 

Mechanical Properties 

The mechanical properties of CPCs are a key property that needs to be determined to 

assess if the composition of the cement is adequate for the intended use. Generally, CPCs have 

poor mechanical properties [121-124], limiting its clinical applications. As a method of 

enhancing these properties, some authors used polymers such as gelatin [125] and short-length 

polyhydroxyalkanoate (linear polyesters produced by bacterial fermentation of sugar or lipids) 

[126]. Several factors can influence the mechanical properties of CPCs, as shown in Table 3 

[127].

Table 3- Properties of CPCs that can affect its mechanical behavior. 

Property Effect 

Formulation [128] Maximum shear resistance can vary for 

formulation to formulation. 

Liquid-to-powder ratio [129] A higher L/P ratio leads to a decrease in shear 

resistance. 

Particle size [130] As the particle size decreases, the shear 

resistance increases. 

Incubation temperature [131] High temperatures can lead to the dehydration 

of the samples, weakening its structure. 

 

In a recent study published by Ingrid Ajaxon et al.[132] the compressive strength and 

elastic properties of brushitic and apatitic CPCs were measured and compared. The brushitic 

CPCs were found to be stronger than the apatitic CPCs, in good agreement with other results 

presented in  literature [80,91,103,133,134]. 

Porosity 

Water is a major intervenient in the setting reaction of CPCs, as shown in previous 

equations (1) and (2). As a result, not all the water is consumed during the hydration phase, 

resulting in a porous structure.  The porosity of CPCs is directly related to the L/P ratio used 

varying between 30% and 50%. Particle size distribution of the starting powders and particles 

packing behavior can also modify the microstructure, as well as the pores size and size 

distribution [135]. Techniques such as mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) [136], gas 

adsorption and thermoporometry (TPM) [137]  and have been used to determine the porosity 

of CPCs [138].

2. Materials and Methods 

In order to better understand how this thesis was conducted, the experimental work will be 

divided into five stages of production. Each stage includes the characterization techniques that are 

required to either move forward to the next stage or to better understand its results. Stages are divided 

as follows:  

Table 4- Description of the different stages of the developed work 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.1 - Stage 1: Synthesis of CaP based powders 

To obtain brushitic and apatitic cement pastes, TCP (?-TCP powder) and BTCP 

(biphasic powder, mixture of ?-TCP and ?-TCP) were used as starting materials. These CaP 

based powders where synthesized via wet chemical precipitation method according to previous 

works [127].  

The synthesis process starts with the preparation of aqueous solutions (deionized water) 

of diamonium hydrogenophophate, ([(NH4)2HPO4.4H2O], Panreac, Spain) and calcium nitrate 

tetrahydrate, ([Ca(NO3)2.4H2O], Panreac, Spain) as phosphorous and calcium precursors, 

respectively. In order to obtain a Ca/P ratio of 1.51, a 0.6M of P solution was used and the Ca 

concentration was adjusted accordingly. Although the theoretical value of Ca/P ratio to obtain 

pure ?-TCP is 1.50, a Ca/P ratio of 1.51 was used to ensure that no ?-CPP (calcium 

pyrophosphate) was formed. The solutions were mixed inside a reactor at 30ºC and stirred at 

700 rpm for 4 hours. The pH levels were monitored in real time, as described below. pH was 

adjusted to 7-8 using an ammonia solution (25% NH3, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) with a final

added volume ranging from 100 mL to 150 mL. After 4 hours, the precipitate was vacuum 

filtered and dried at 100ºC for 72h.  The full process is schematically presented in Figure 7. A 

total of nine synthesis were performed, hereafter denominated as S-I, S-II, S-III, S-IV, S-V, S-

VI, S-VII, S-VIII, S-IX, in order to have enough powder for the desired assays, resulting in 

200-250 g of powder per synthesis.  

 

 

2.1.1 - pH and temperature monitoring  

As described in previous works [127], experimental conditions such as Ca/P ratio,  

synthesis time, pH and temperature, are essential to obtain the desired powder composition. 

For the standard synthesis conditions available in the lab, the pH is not continually measured 

and the temperature evaluation is relied on the oil bath recirculation to maintain the targeted 

30ºC within the reactor. Since small fluctuations in pH could influence the final products, a 

data logger (DrDAQ, PICO) coupled with a pH sensor (DD011) connected to a laptop running 

a logging software (PICOlog) were used in order to monitor the pH in real time, obtaining 

values every second (Figure 8). This allowed a more precise control over pH conditions and an 

overall optimization of the reaction, raising the number of control points from ?30 to 14400. 

Regarding temperature, it was monitored by a digital thermometer equipped with a metal rod 

every 5 minutes. The obtained data (.txt file) was processed using MatLab to automate the 

process. In order to better represent the data, every 10 minutes a total of 10 control points ([-

5s, +5s]) were chosen, its average value calculated and then plotted.

2.2 - Stage 2: Calcination and milling of CaP based powders 

The dry precipitates were deagglomerated and then calcined. To obtain TCP, the CaP 

based milled powder was calcined in a Termolab furnace at 1000ºC maximum temperature 

with 2h holding time with a heating rate of 5ºC/min, followed by natural cooling to ambient 

temperature. To obtain BTCP, previously ?-TCP powder  was submitted to 1250ºC maximum 

temperature with the following schedule [127]: 10ºC/min until 1000ºC, followed 5ºC/min to 

1250ºC, with 10h holding time at this temperature with subsequent cooling to 30ºC at 20ºC/min 

rate. Figure 9 summarizes the calcination schedules used to obtain both powders. After cooling, 

both powders were milled and analyzed in terms of particle size distribution and crystalline 

phases. 

 

2.2.1 - Particle size distribution (PSD) analysis  

Particle size distribution was determined using a Coulter LS 230 (Fraunhofer optical 

model, United Kingdom), allowing a measurement of particles in the range of 0.4 µm-2000

µm. For that, the powders were dispersed in an aqueous medium with a few drops of 

deflocculant (Targon 1128, BK Giulini Chemie, Germany) for deagglomeration and ultra-

sonicated for 5 minutes at ambient temperature.  

2.2.2 - Crystalline phase 

The crystalline phases of both CaP based powders (TCP and BTCP) were determined 

via X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a high resolution diffractometer (Bunker D8 Advance 

DaVinci) with Cu-K? radiation at a wavelength of ?=1.5406 Å, scan interval (2?) of 5º to 70º 

and a step width of 0.0130º 2?.s-1. The identification of the crystalline phases was evaluated 

comparing the obtained diffractogram to the standard diffractograms listed below in Table 5:

2.3 - Stage 3: Preparation and casting cement pastes with and without antibiotic 

As described in chapter 1.3, to obtain a cement paste, a solid phase is mixed with a 

liquid phase. In the present work, two cement paste compositions have been prepared to obtain 

brushitic and apatitic cements. The system ?-TCP + MCPM (Monocalcium phosphate 

monohydrate, [Ca(H2PO4)2.H2O], Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) mixed with citric acid aqueous 

solutions (15%, [C6H8O7], Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) was used for brushitic cements 

preparation, while BTCP mixed with 3wt% of anhydrous sodium hydrogen phosphate 

[Na2HPO4] (Merck, Germany) or citric acid (10-15%) were used to obtain apatitic or brushitic 

cements, respectively [120]. The pastes were prepared by adding the powders with different 

amounts of liquid phase according to the desired liquid to powder ratio: 0.28, 0.30, 0.34, 0.38 

and 0.40 mL.g-1. For cements loaded with antibiotic, 2.5 wt.% of levofloxacin was added to 

the paste. All pastes were then casted in different mold shapes according to characterization 

requirements (pellets, cylinders or microneedles). The molded samples were then placed in an 

oven with controlled temperature and humidity (37ºC, with a set humidity of 80%) for the time 

required for setting and subsequently de-molded and kept in the same condition for further 96 

h.  After this period, in order to study the probability of drug migration to the surface of the 

samples, two different drying processes were used: (1) cement samples were placed at 40ºC 

without controlled humidity until complete drying (oven drying, OD); (2) samples were 

immediately frozen at -80ºC for 48h and then lyophilized for 24h (freeze drying-Liof).  Figure 

10 resumes the full process.

2.3.1 - Setting time (IST and FST) 

Initial setting time (IST) and final setting time (FST) of the cement pastes were 

determined using a Gillmore needle apparatus, as stated in the norm ISO/DIS 18531:2015 (E). 

After mixture, the cement paste is poured into a silicone mold (3 cm in diameter, 1 cm thick) 

and placed in a closed box (with a relative humidity ?70%). For IST purposes the lower weight 

needle was used while for FST was used the heavy needle.  The measurements consist in 

pouring the needle onto the surface of the cement sample every 30s and observing if an 

indentation is formed. The process was repeated until no indentation was visible in the cement 

surface, being this times IST of FST.  

 

2.3.2 - Mechanical properties 

The cement pastes were casted into cylinders (as shown in Figure 10) (? 6 mm, height: 

12 mm) for compressive strength measurements. For all cylinders, parallel base surfaces were 

assured (rectifying if not parallel) and its mechanical properties were tested using a Shimandzu 

Autograph (Japan), equipped with a 10 kN load cell (Figure 11). Each cylinder was placed 

between the pressure plates and compressed until failure at a strain rate of 1 mm.min-1.

2.3.3 - Porosity and density 

The total porosity (open and closed porosity) was determined from the real density and 

the apparent density, as shown in equation 3: 

Total porosity =  

??? ???????????????? ???????

   (3) 

where,       

? Open porosity: network of fine interconnected capillaries, connected to the surface of 

the material; 

? Closed porosity: pores with no connection to the surface; 

? Apparent density: ratio between the weight and the apparent volume of a sample. Dried 

cement samples (40ºC for 4 days) were weighted and their apparent volume determined 

according to the Archimedes principle by immersion in mercury, as presented in 

previous works [127]. The apparatus used for this measurement was presented in Figure 

13.  

? Real density: difference between the apparent volume of the sample and the total 

volume of pores (open and closed), which was determined by a Helium pycnometer 

(Multipycnometer Quantumchrome, US). For this test, dried and milled cement 

samples were used.

2.3.4 – Microstructural analysis  

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4100, Japan), was used to determine 

the microstructural properties of the samples. The microscope is equipped with an electron 

emission system with a tungsten filament, and all the images were taken with an acceleration 

of 25 kV at different magnifications. Surface of the cement samples were observed. 

2.4 - Stage 4:  Antibiotic distribution and release studies 

In this stage of the thesis, antibiotic distribution in cement samples and release studies 

were carried out. Samples loaded with 2.5% of levofloxacin (oven dried and lyophilized) were 

analyzed via Raman using a confocal Raman microscope (WITec alpha300 RAS+ (WITec, 

Ulm, Germany). An Nd:YAG laser operating at 532 nm were used as excitation source, with 

the power set 5mW (150 x 150 points per grid in a 50 x 50 ?m area, 2s) to access the drug 

distribution on the samples. Drug release studies were carried out on the Faculty of Pharmacy, 

Universidade Nova, Lisbon. 

2.4.1 - Preparation of the samples 

During preparation of levofloxacin loaded cement pastes with biphasic powder (BTCP) 

using anhydrous sodium hydrogen phosphate as liquid phase composition, it was verified that 

resulting cement paste exhibited two phases (liquid and solid) instead of one (as per usual with 

the samples without levofloxacin). This phenomenon was attributed to the lower solubility of 

the levofloxacin in basic solutions when compared to acidic solutions. In order to verify this 

issue, the pH of the two used liquid phases (anhydrous hydrogen phosphate and citric acid) was 

measured and, as expected, the citric acid solution has a pH of 1.65, compared to the 8.58 pH 

value of the anhydrous sodium hydrogen phosphate solution. High pH values causes 

insolubility of levofloxacin and consequently, the hindrance of cement setting with subsequent 

phases separation. To overcome this problem, it was decided to use citric acid (10%) as liquid 

phase for BTCP levofloxacin loaded samples for release studies.  

Accordingly, cement samples were prepared using the formulations described in Table 

8. The resulting pastes were molded into cylinders (height: 12 mm; diameter: 6 mm), incubated 

for 24 h (37.5ºC, 80 % humidity), frozen for 2 days (-80ºC) and lyophilized. In order to assess 

the influence of the lyophilization on the drug release rate, samples from batch 2 (Table 8, 

TCP-0.30-L-OD and TCP-0.30-OD) were placed 4 days in a drying oven at 40ºC (Oven dried) 

instead of being frozen and lyophilized.

2.4.2 - In vitro drug release assay 

Levofloxacin loaded cylindrical samples were tested in order to determine the drug 

release profile and kinetics. For this study, 3 levofloxacin loaded cylinders and one blank 

(without loaded drug) from each batch formulation were used, amounting to a total of 16 

samples. Samples were accurately weighted, placed on a 50 mL Falcon tube and immersed in 

25 mL of a biomimetic medium (phosphate buffer saline, PBS, Sigma-Aldrich) at pH 7.4. The 

tubes were then placed on a 37ºC water bath (Memmert, Germany) and shaken horizontally 

(130 rpm) during the assay (72 h) (Figure 14A).  

At pre-determined times of 10 min, 0.5h, 1h, 2h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 24h, 48h and 72h, 5 mL of 

each medium was collected (and replaced with the same volume of fresh medium) and analysed 

via UV-spectrometry, at 288 nm in a multiplate reader (FLUOstar Omega, BMG Labtech) in

triplicate, as shown in Figure 14B. The absorption of the medium collected from the 

correspondent blank samples at the same time points were used as controls. 

Calibration curves were prepared in PBS medium with 7 standards (i.e. 75, 65, 50, 40, 

25, 15 and 5 ?g mL-1 of levofloxacin). The absorbance of PBS was also measured to be used 

as blank. The calibration curves were repeated for each time point and 3 replicates were 

considered for each standard. The standards were prepared from a levofloxacin stock solution 

(with a concentration of 500 ?g mL-1, obtained by the dissolution of 125 mg into 25 mL PBS,) 

maintained at 37ºC during the assay. 

The main assessments made during the release study are as follows: 

i. Levofloxacin release profile (over a 72h period); 

ii. Release kinetics. 

Following the results of the antibiotic release essay, the best formulations were then 

used to fabricate the microneedles.

2.5 – Stage 5: Microneedle fabrication 

The preparation of the cement pastes for the microneedles casting was conducted as 

described in section 2.3. The prepared pastes were then poured into a mold as seen in Figure 

15. Several casting processes were used to obtain the best filling results (filling full length of 

the needle):  

i. Manual casting: the pastes were poured into the mold and pressed downwards with a 

spatula; 

ii. Vacuum casting: the pastes were poured into the mold and placed in a vacuum 

chamber; 

iii. Ultrasound casting: after pouring the pastes into the mold, the mold was then placed 

into a Petri dish and sonicated. 

The manual filling was the technique that produced the best results and was the one used 

throughout this thesis. Mechanical properties and SEM imaging were used to characterize the 

samples, according to the procedure described in section 2.3.2 and 2.3.4, respectively.

3. Results and Discussion 

3.1 - Characterization of the starting powders  

As stated in Chapter 2, CaP based powders where synthesized via wet chemical 

precipitation method, where a close monitoring of the pH and temperature was made 

during the full complete synthesis time (180 min). These two parameters are of paramount 

importance since they influence the phases formed. pH evaluation with time for all nine 

synthesis is plotted in Figure 16, while average temperature measurements for each 

synthesis are presented in Figure 17.

As seen in Figure 17, the temperature could not be maintained at a steady 30ºC 

being observed slight variations in the several syntheses evaluated (S I-IX). Concerning 

pH, higher variations are observed in the first hour attaining more stable values from this 

time to the end of the synthesis. Oppositely, synthesis S-VIII and S-IX presents the 

highest pH values almost stable (pH 8 - 8.5) throughout full synthesis time, resulting from 

the higher amount of ammonia added in the beginning of the synthesis.  

The dried powders resultant from the previous synthesis were then calcined (first 

calcination at 1000ºC/2h holding time). X-ray diffraction was used to identify crystalline 

phases of the powders in all the synthesis evaluated (S - I to IX). Figure 18 presents the 

results obtained. 

For the experimental conditions used (Ca/P = 1.51, pH 7-8 and 30 ºC) powders 

from S-II, III, VII, VIII and IX presented ?-TCP as its main phase with different amounts 

of HA as secondary phase, except for powders resultant from S-I, IV, V and VI which 

seemed to be pure ?-TCP. The existence of HA in some powders could be explained by 

the fluctuations in pH and temperature observed during their synthesis (Figure 16 and 17, 

respectively), essentially in the first hour of the synthesis. None of the synthesized 

powders presented a detectable ?-CPP phase being a good indication for going further 

with ?-TCP to ?-TCP transformation, since is stablished from a previous work that a ?-

CPP phase produces an undesired effect in the ?? ?-TCP transformation [95, 127]. 

However, detecting low quantities of ?-CPP phase by X-ray diffraction is not an easy 

task, as its most intense (2? = 29.6 º) and second most intense (2? = 27.6 º) peaks overlap 

the ?-TCP peaks. Only the third most intense peak (2? = 28.9º), not being overlapped by 

any other peak, is used to identify this phase. Oppositely, traces of HA phase are easier 

to identify, with its most intense peak (2? =31,8 º) not overlapped by any of the ?-TCP 

peaks.

According to these results, powders from S-I, IV, V and VI were selected to 

proceed with further studies with ?-TCP powder. Powders from S- II, III, VII, VIII and 

IX were mixed and then submitted to the second calcination in order to obtain ?-TCP. 

Unfortunately, powders II and III were mislabeled for V and VI, by mistake. So, in reality, 

the following mixtures were obtained: S-I, II, III and IV for following with TCP studies 

and S-V, VI, VII, VIII and IX for going further for ? to ?-TCP transformation (second 

calcination at 1250ºC/10h holding time). Figure 19 presents the XRD results of the 

resultant powder after the second calcination.

Surprisingly, as it can be seen, the obtained powder is not pure ?-TCP, but a 

mixture of ?-TCP and ?-TCP, so a biphasic powder. The quantification of these 

crystalline phases obtained by Rietveld refinement shows that powder presents 70 wt.% 

of ?-TCP and 30 wt.% of ?-TCP, which fitting is presented in Figure 20. This means that 

powder from synthesis V and/or VI after first calcination (Figure 18) should be 

Figure 20- Rietveld refinement used to access the amount of the crystalline 
phases in the powder resultant from second calcination.

and S-VI) after first thermal treatment.

responsible for the appearance of ?-TCP. To clarify this, FTIR has been evaluated in these 

both powders, which results are presented in Figure 21. 

In fact, powder resultant from synthesis V is not only ?-TCP as identified by X-

Ray diffraction (Figure 19) but present a small amount of ?-CPP, only detected by FTIR. 

The presence of the characteristic vibrational modes of the PO4 groups (around 550 cm-
1, 607 cm-1, 942 cm-1, 970 cm-1 and 1042 cm-1) confirm the ?-TCP phase formation [139]. 

The marked bands at 727 cm-1 and 1212 cm-1 are characteristic of P2O74- group of ?-CPP. 

These bands are clearly visible in the spectrum of S-V and not in S-VI, confirming the 

existence of traces of ?-CPP in S-V, which stabilizes??-TCP phase, explaining the 

existence of ?-TCP phase after the second thermal treatment in the full mixture [95, 127]. 

From this point forward, the raw powders will be referenced as follows: 

? TCP (for ?-TCP powder);  

? BTCP (for biphasic powder). 

PSD analysis was determined using the procedure described in Chapter 2, section 

2.2.1. Based on previous works [127], the milling was conducted in a controlled manner. 

The powders were milled and analyzed for PSD in timed intervals to avoid decreasing the 

D50 particle size below 1 ?m. Figure 22 presents particle size distribution of TCP and 

BTCP powders.

The particle size distribution is one of the most important powder characteristics 

for cement pastes preparation. Although the particle size distribution mentioned in the 

previous work (bimodal distribution with D50 around 1 ?m) was used to obtain injectable 

cement pastes [127], a similar PSD can be also used to prepare ceramic pastes for molding 

microneedles. Since the tip of the microneedles ranges form 25-100 ?m ideally, reaching 

a D50 around 1-1.5 ?m guarantees that this parameter will not influence the molding 

process. The D50 was used as reference parameter to choose when to stop the milling 

process.  

Both TCP and BTCP powders, present a similar bimodal particle size distribution 

with D50 around 1.01 ?m and D50 around 1.27 ?m, respectively. Bimodal particles size 

distributions are likely to allow the preparation of pastes with highly packing behavior, 

important factor to avoid high porosity levels and improve the mechanical properties of 

the final cements [140].

3.2 - Characterization of the cement pastes 

Self-setting pastes for casting microneedles molds might follow two important 

criteria: (1) high initial setting time to allow paste preparation and complete casting and 

(2) adequate mechanical properties for complete de-molding and skin penetration without 

damaging. TCP and BTCP cement pastes were tested for its ISTs and FSTs to better 

understand how an optimization of the molding process could be made. Figure 23 shows 

the ISTs and FSTs of the cement pastes obtained from TCP and BTCP powders, according 

to the compositions presented in Table 6 and 7 (Chapter 2).

pastes obtained from TCP (A) and BTCP powders (B), according to the

For this analysis, the influence of L/P ratio, liquid composition and the addition 

of levofloxacin in IST and FST were studied for both powders. As expected, as L/P ratio 

increases, IST and FST increases for both powders [141]. For TCP, IST increases from 

around 2 min to 5 min when L/P changes from 0.28 to 0.34 while for BTCP, IST increases 

from 10 min to 20 min when L/P increases from 0.28 to 0.40. For a given L/P ratio, the 

presence of levofloxacin increases the IST and FST for all cement pastes tested, when 

compared with the same cements without levofloxacin. These results are in good 

agreement with results obtained by other authors [141,143]. 

Comparing the two liquid compositions used in BTCP cement pastes, for the same 

L/P ratio (0.34) is possible to observe that IST and FST increases from 14 min to 17 min 

for 10 % AC solution, but decreases to 6 min for 15% AC solution. Adding higher 

amounts of AC (from 10 to 15 wt %) in aqueous solution, IST and FST decreases. Since 

for 15 wt.%, IST is too low (5 min), it means that time for casting the paste in the mould 

will be short to guarantee flowing conditions of the paste to the deeper parts of the mould. 

Due to that, 10 wt.% of AC solution was used for further studies and the remaining 

compositions were discarded.

3.3 - Characterization of the CPCs 

3.3.1 - Mechanical strength, porosity and crystalline phases 

The as-prepared TCP and BTCP cement pastes were molded into cylinders and its 

mechanical properties tested following the methodology described in section 2.3.2. 

Compressive strength (A), porosity (B) and crystalline phases (C) of TCP (Figure 24) and 

BTCP (Figure 26) cement samples, in presence and in the absence of antibiotic, dried in 

different conditions, were tested. Figure 25 and Figure 27 present the XRD of the resultant 

cements from TCP and BTCP powders, respectively.

As shown in previous works [127], the mechanical properties and the porosity of 

the CPCs are tightly related. As the porosity of a sample increases, its mechanical strength 

should decrease, and vice versa. Moreover, compressive strength of cements increases as 

L/P ratio decreases with concomitant decreasing of porosity. This trend was verified when 

L/P ratio changes from 0.30 to 0.34 mL.g-1, instead for 0.28 mL.g-1 (Figure 24A) when 

compared with higher L/P ratios. It can be attributed to: (i) higher viscosity of the pastes 

for 0.28 mL.g-1L/P ratio, which difficult the casting procedure with subsequent air 

bubbles trapped in the cement paste; (ii) DCP as crystalline phase formed, which presents 

lower density than brushite phase.    

As it can be seen, drying samples by lyophilization increased the overall 

compressive strength in all tested TCP samples when compared to the oven dried samples. 

These results are in good agreement with porosity data (Figure 24B), since a lower 

porosity increases the mechanical strength of the cement. For 0.30 mLg-1 L/P ratio, the 

addition of levofloxacin decreases the compressive strength of the cements (oven dried 

and lyophilized), with concomitant increase in porosity values, while for 0.34 mLg-1 L/P 

ratio, slightly variations in both properties were observed. This could be explained by the 

incomplete transformation of ?-TCP in brushite (DCPD) phase (Figure 24C and Figure 

25) for the TCP-0.34-liof in absence of levofloxacin. 

For cements obtained from BTCP powders, increasing L/P ratio resulted in an 

expected decrease in compressive strength for the cement samples prepared with aqueous 

solution containing 3 wt.% HP (Figure 26A The porosity results (Figure 26B) for the 

BTCP samples indicate that using sodium hydrogen phosphate instead of citric acid 

results in similar porosity values for the same L/P ratio (0.34). Increasing citric acid 

concentration from 10 to 15-wt% decreases compressive strength values with a 

simultaneous increase of porosity. Since citric acid acts like an accelerator of the setting 

reaction (Figure 23B), viscosity of the cement paste increases rapidly and consequently 

handling time decreases. Due to that, casting procedure is difficult (likely to air bubbles 

formation), particles arrangement becomes more difficult resulting in a highly porous 

structure.    

According to the results obtained for TCP cements, addition of levofloxacin 

slightly decreases compressive strength, as well as, increases porosity.

For the BTCP samples (Figure 26C and Figure 27) prepared with HP liquid, 

CDHA is the main phase with unreacted ?-TCP and ?-TCP. In presence of AC as liquid 

phase, cements from BTCP powders present unreacted ?-TCP as the main phase with 

small amounts of brushite for BTCP-0.34-10AC in absence or in presence of 

levofloxacin. For cement prepared with 15-wt% citric acid, monetite (DCP) was formed 

instead of brushite. This can be attributed both to the lower setting times and pH values 

of the cement paste.  

The differences in the phases composition between BTCP cements prepared with 

HP and AC as liquid composition, explain the higher compressive strength values 

obtained for the cement samples prepared with HP. In fact, BTCP-0.34-HP3-OD and 

BTCP-0.34-AC10-Liof cement samples present similar porosity values while 

compressive strength of the first is around 34 MPa, significantly higher value than the 

second one (around 18 MPa). The higher compressive strength is related to the higher 

amount of CDHA (apatitic phase) in BTCP-0.34-HP3-OD.

Comparing brushitic (Figure 24) and apatitic cements (Figure 26), as for example 

TCP-0.34-Liof and BTCP-0.34-HP3-OD, similar porosity values can be observed while 

compressive strength is significantly higher for the apatitic one, as expected.

3.3.2 - Surface analysis  

The microstructural characteristics (surface) of the CPCs obtained from TCP 

powders, i. e., TCP-0.30-L-OD, TCP-0.30-OD, TCP-0.30-L-Liof, TCP-0.30-Liof, TCP-

0.34-L-Liof and TCP-0.34-Liof are presented in Figure 28. Figure 29 presents the 

micrographs of the BTCP-0.34-L-Liof and BTCP-0.34-Liof cements.  

 The large spherical pores shown in Figure 28 are most likely due to air bubbles 

trapped in the cement paste during mixing and molding. Analyzing surface 

microstructures of the TCP cements obtained from 0.30 mL.g-1 L/P ratio (Figure 28), 

oven dried and lyophilized, is possible to observe that lyophilized samples presented a 

smooth surface with apparently less porosity, in good agreement with compressive 

strength values for lyophilized samples (Figure 24A). Since total porosity values are 

similar for oven dried and lyophilized samples (Figure 24B), pore size and size 

distribution should be different, i.e., lyophilized samples should present small pores 

homogenously distributed, which could explain the better mechanical properties obtained 

for lyophilized TCP cements (Figure 24A). The presence of levofloxacin seems to 

decrease the crystals size, more visible in lyophilized TCP samples prepared with 0.34 

mL.g-1.  

For the BTCP samples (Figure 29), the presence of levofloxacin appears to 

increase porosity on the surface with larger pore size, in concordance with the results 

presented in Figure 26 A and B.

3.4 - Antibiotic release studies 

3.4.1 - Quantification method 

Calibration curves (and their respective equations) were calculated for each time 

point (see table in figure 30), and illustrated in Figure 30: Linearity (5-75 ?g mL-1) and 

reproducibility were analyzed and considered adequate for sample analysis, with a 

coefficient value (CV/%) of 0.005 &gt; CV &gt; 0.251. 

 

 

Clearly, as shown in Figure 30 by the decreasing slope, there was some 

degradation of the levofloxacin in the media over the 72h period. Comparing the curves 

with the highest concentration (75.00 ?g mL-1) between the 10 min and 48h time points, 

a decrease of 30.79 % over this period suggests that not only light, but also temperature, 

influence the stability of the levofloxacin in the solution and therefore, the levofloxacin 

released by the samples as well. Nevertheless, the effect of temperature is compensated 

as the concentration of the drug in the release media was calculated using the levofloxacin 

standard incubated during the same time frame.

3.4.2 - In-vitro drug release  

Figure 31 presents release profiles of levofloxacin from the 4 batches studied 

(table 8, chapter 2, section 2.4.2).  As it can be seen, a complete levofloxacin release was 

achieved for TCP-0.30-L-Liof, TCP-0.30-L-OD and TCP-0.34-L-Liof after 48h and, for 

BTCP-0.34-L-Liof , after 24h (Figure 31B). The drying process had no influence over the 

levofloxacin release, as TCP-0.30-L-Liof and TCP-0.30-L-OD present similar 

cumulative percentage values at all time points (Fig.31 and Table 9). 

Between TCP-0.30-L-Liof and TCP-0.34-L-Liof, a faster release profile for TCP-

0.34-L-Liof indicates that L/P has some influence over the release rate. Levofloxacin 

release increased 9.6% in 24 h, from 75.0 ± 1.6% (TCP-0.30-L-Liof) to 84.6 ± 7.4% (TCP-

0.34-L-Liof). BTCP-0.34-L-Liof presents the fastest release profile, with 108.8 ± 6.9% of 

levofloxacin release over a 24h period.

3.4.5 - Kinetics 

The release kinetic mechanism was obtained with the experimental release data 

fitted to different kinetic models including: First order; Higuchi and Coupled mechanism 

[144] (Table 9). For all the formulations, at least half of the levofloxacin content was 

released in the first 8 hours, even with some major differences between them. Using the 

Higuchi model for that period, we can observe that the ?-TCP (BTCP-0.34-L-Liof) has a 

higher kH than the ?-TCP formulations, indicating a higher initial release rate. Moreover, 

the good fit of release data to the Higuchi model (during the first 8h) suggests that the drug 

is released by simple diffusion mechanism within this initial time frame (Bettencourt et al., 

2000). Overall, the best fitting model for all samples was the designated “coupled 

mechanism”, first described by Frutos et al. [145] and previously used to describe other in 

vitro release studies of drugs from bone cements [146,147]. The model, defined in the third 

equation on Table 10, suggests a mechanism based on dissolution/diffusion process with an 

initial burst effect. The term b(1 – e-kcmt) is associated with a first order kinetic dissolution 

process and the term c?t with Fickian diffusion. The b and c parameters represent the 

contributions (in percentage values) of the dissolution and diffusion processes to the release 

of levofloxacin at any t time, and the parameter a is associated with the initial burst effect. 

The b and c parameters varied inversely, with the dissolution parameter (parameter b) 

prevailing over the diffusion (parameter c) process for all samples (Fig. 32), while the 

parameter a in BTCP-0.34-L-Liof suggests a stronger initial burst release over the other 

three formulations.  As so, on the first 8 hours, due to the higher concentration of 

levofloxacin in the samples vs. the medium, the diffusion process prevails. As the 

equilibrium is reached, the dissolution process controls the rate at which the levofloxacin 

is released within the 72 hours.

3.5 - Evaluation of levofloxacin distribution throughout cement samples 

 Raman spectra of the microneedle plates was used to access the distribution 

of the levofloxacin in oven dried and lyophilized samples. Both sides of the array were 

analyzed. The bottom side refers to the side without microneedles while top side refers to 

the side of MN plate (containing the microneedles). Figure 33 presents the Raman spectra 

obtained in both sides of MN plates for a TCP based MN obtained with 0.34 mLg-1 L/P 

ratio, oven dried and lyophilized, as well as, BTCP based microneedle obtained with the 

same L/P ratio and dried in both conditions. As expected, all samples presents CaP bands 

visible at 970 cm-1 [139] and levofloxacin bands at 1395 cm-1, 1614 cm-1, 1726 cm-1[148, 

149]. Since this analysis is qualitative, it is only possible to extrapolate conclusions within 

the same sample, by comparing the CaP and levofloxacin intensity bands ratio (most 

intense ones). However, comparing the Raman spectra obtained in top and bottom sides 

of TCP-0.34-L-OD and TCP-0.34-L-Liof based MN is difficult to observe significant 

differences and to draw reliable conclusions.   

 In order to shed light on this point, Raman confocal images were also obtained 

in both sides of the MN plates, which are presented in Figure 34 and 35 for, TCP-0.34-L 

(OD and Liof) and BTCP-0.34-L (OD and Liof), respectively.   

 Looking to the TCP samples (Figure 34), it seems that the lyophilized samples 

benefit from this drying procedure, as the drug distribution seems to be more homogenous 

than in the oven dried samples. On the other hand, the results from the BTCP samples are 

quite ambiguous, being difficult to draw any firm conclusions concerning the influence 

of drying process on drug distribution.  For that, additional experiments should be 

evaluated.  

 Furthermore, since drug release profiles for oven dried and lyophilized 

samples have been similar (Figure 31), it means that levofloxacin distribution throughout 

cement samples should be analogous in both drying procedures.

3.5 Microneedle characterization 

3.5.1 - Mechanical properties and SEM imaging 

To have a better perspective of the microneedle array, images of the microneedles 

were taken using a regular camera (13 MP), a magnifying glass camera (Leica EZ4 HD) 

and a SEM microscope. SEM imaging (x30, x100 magnifications) was used to 

characterize microneedles and to measure them, while the other camera was used to 

acquire images that better represent the arrays. The results are shown in Figures 36-38.

camera (top right) and SEM (bottom) with x30 and x100 magnifications.

All the above images show fully filled needle tips and some partially filled. The 

incomplete filling is derived to the not-yet optimized molding procedure and the PSD not 

being optimal (&gt; 1 µm), as the larger particles can obstruct deeper parts of the mold (tip 

of MN). Other mentioned techniques (chapter 2, section 2.5), such as vacuum filling, had 

slightly worse filling performance for the same needle geometry [141], confirming the 

manual filling as the best molding method for high viscosity pastes.  

The tips of the TCP-0.30-L-Liof, TCP-0.34-L-Liof and BTCP-0.30-Liof and 

BTCP-0.34-L-Liof based microneedles were tested by compressive test to evaluate the 

maximum force that can be applied to the MN without damaging the tip. Results are 

presented in Figure 39. These values should be prudently analyzed since the MN in the 

array could present different length resultant to the incomplete fill of the MN mold (high 

standard deviation values). As higher the length of MN, as sharper is the tip resulting in 

smaller tip surface area and, consequently, lower mechanical resistance. The TCP-0.34-

L-Liof composition was the most resistant with 110 N, followed by the TCP-0-30-L-Liof  

with 77 N and the BTCP-0.34-L-Liof with 57 N. 

Comparing these results with the ones obtained by Cai et al. [16], the height of 

the fabricated needles is 4 times the size of the ones obtained in this study.

4. Conclusions and Future work 

With a main objective of producing drug-loaded ceramic microneedles capable of 

piercing the skin and successfully deliver all of the drug, this thesis can be considered a 

success, at least on that point. From the obtained results, we can conclude: 

? The control of pH and temperature of the synthesis reaction are essential 

experimental parameters to obtained the desired crystalline phases in CaP based 

powders; 

? The presence of Na2HPO4 in liquid phase composition used for the BTCP cements 

preparation avoids the solubilization of levofloxacin, interfering in the cement 

setting. 

? The L/P ratio influences the mechanical resistances of the cements; 

? The addition of levofloxacin increased the setting times of all the tested 

compositions; 

? The addition of levofloxacin slightly decreased the mechanical properties of the 

cements; 

? Drying process by Lyophilization increases the mechanical properties of the 

resultant cements; 

? All the cement based MN tested have enough mechanical strength to pierce the 

surface of the skin; 

? From the release assay, we can conclude that the levofloxacin is 100% released 

within the first 48 hours, for all compositions tested. 

As the microneedles present promising characteristics for future biomedical 

applications, further work should be done: 

? Developing an improved method for casting the microneedles; 

? Evaluate skin penetration tests with the self-setting microneedles obtained  

? Evaluate the transdermal drug delivery in situ.
