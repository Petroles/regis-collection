Key-words: Congo Craton; structural control of the kimberlites I lamproites emplacement; South Atlantic opening; break-up of Congo

Abstract: In the present synthesis, the geology of Lunda (NE Angola) is presented and discussed with the objective of providing a better

understanding of the regional occurrence of primary and secondary diamond deposits. The huge regional diamondiferous potential is viewed in a global

perspective, firstly based on the edification of the Congo Craton from an Archaean nucleus, till several mobile belts accreted successively to that core.
In this cratonic block the geothermal gradient variation and the stability curve of diamond are determinant both in the genesis and the transportation

of this precious mineral up to the surface.
Following this, we analyse the tectonosedimentary evolution of the Congo Basin, an enormous depression in central Africa; where the depo-

sition of thick sedimentary sequences is a consequence of an endorheic drainage, that begins in the upper Palaeozoic and has its maximum expression

in the Meso-Cenozoic. The sedimentological processes, essentially terrigenous and continental, is controlled by the pre-Atlantic deformation of the

Congo Craton and reaches a critical point with the opening of the South Atlantic since the Cretaceous . The oceanic rifting produces important tectonic
consequences in the African plate, reactivating structures from previous orogenic cycles. These structures exerted the control of kimberlite emplace-

ment and associated alkaline ring structures.
The sedimentological analysis and the lithostratigraphic definition of post-kimberlites sedimentary units are emphasised: Kwango Group,

Kalahari Group and Quaternary deposits, formed in successive erosion/deposition cycles with consequent reworking of its diamond content. These are

viewed with an exploration and economical potential.

Finally, a critical balance is made and the economical consequences of these vast diamondiferous resources are discussed based on future

economic perspectives.

INTRODUCTION

Lunda Province, in NE Angola, is known as a
diamondiferous region since the beginning of the XX
century. Despite the fact that this region is extremely rich
in diamondiferous gravels and in mineralised kimber-
lites, the diamond mineralisation practically extends to
the entire area of Angola. However the Lunda geology
encompasses all kinds of diamond ores and thus, its
knowledge is very important in exploration programmes.

Taking this into account, this work deals mainly with
the geology of the Lunda area. However, it is also neces-
sary to focus on some aspects of the general geology of
Angola, namely the Congo Craton evolution and some
continental sedimentary units pre and post -kimberlite
emplacement, that are important to the overall compre-
hension of the diamond problem in Angola.

The diamond exploration in the Lunda province is
reported to have started in 1912 with the finding of 7
diamonds in the Mussalala River, an east ern margin
tributary of the Chiumbe River. With the adequate technical
support, diamond exploration began in 1913, which
resulted in the opening of the first open cast mines in
1919 - Cavuco, Camimanga, Cassanguidi and Luaco
mines. Since then until the year of 1999, about 63,6 x 106

carats were produced, in addition to the estimated 9 x 106

carats illegally explo ited between the years 1984-1999.
The ongoing exploitation works are conducted both in
kimberlites and in eluvio-aluvial gravels.

In the past, the main exploitation activities were
developed essentially in alluvial deposits, either in recent
alluvial gravels related with the present drainage system,
or in other sedimentary units which post-date the kimber-
lite intrusions. The most significant is the Calonda
Formation, a Cretaceous continental unit considered as
the first sedimentary collector of diamonds after the
supergenic destruction of the kimberlites. The sedimen-
tary diamondiferous deposits that are linked to the
present river system drainage activity are associated with
the erosion of the Calonda Formation basal conglome-
rates.

The continual depletion of reserves in recent alluvial
gravels rich in diamonds demands that new efforts be
placed on diamond exploration, which in spite of current
smuggling, new findings are possible. However, the
future main target in alluvial exploration and mining
should be the Calonda Formation basal gravel, even with
the inconvenience of the high overburden thickness that
reaches frequently 50 to 80 meters or more.

Regarding the primary diamond sources, several
hundred kimberlite bodies are known in Angola. Less
than 50 % of these kimberlites were studied and, from
these, less than 5 % are economically exploitable. Among
these bodies, there are three that are in the 10 biggest
diatremes in the world. In the past, only the upper yellow
ground levels were exploited and a large amount of
proven reserves are still unexploitable. Recently, new
findings of kimberlites in Lunda have been reported. In
the present state of knowledge the diamond reserves in
primary sources still unknown, but a huge potential is
devised in view of the alluvial ore grades.

Because of this, there is a growing interest in the
primary diamond sources and some contracts have been
established with international companies for exploration
and mining of primary sources.

The prolonged mining history of Lunda diamonds,
the data relative to past and present mining activities, the
vast areas with huge mining potential both for primary or
secondary diamond deposits, and the end of civil war
with progressive stabilization of social and political life
in the country justifies the renewed interest for diamond
exploration in Angola, and consequently in the geology
of the Lund a Provinc e. Table I shows a synopsis of
Lunda geology, with the geological units grouped
considering the main tectonic cycles recognised in
Angola.

The Congo Craton

The occurrence of a Precambrian cratons, especially
those of Archaean age, have long been recognised as a
major guideline for the exploration of primary diamond
deposits - Clifford's rule (e. g. CLIFFORD, 1966;
JENNINGS, 1995 and references therein). This empirical
rule has been explained with the geological conditions
for the preservation of diamonds, which occur domi-
nantly under these Archaean cratons, until a volcanic
episode brings them to the surface (e. g . HELMSTAED &amp;amp;
GURNEY, 1995).

The influence of the geological nature of the cratonic
basement, in the location of the kimberlites, is paradig-
matic in the case ofAngola. It is notorious the dominance
of kimberlite occurrences in Archaean terranes that are
characterized by amphibolites, amphibolitic gneisses, '
mafic granulites and charnockites. The kimberlite pro-
vinces, defined by RBIS (1972), are coincident with the
zone of influence of the Archaean tectonometamorphic

cycle (Fig. 1), despite the fact that the outcropping of the
Archaean is very discontinued due to granitoid intrusions
in latter orogenic cycles, mainly in the Ebumean.

The nature of the Archaean crust, composed by
metasedimentary rocks with a great abundance of mafic
rocks, later metamorphosed to granulitic facies, shows
great mantle activity. The Eburnean crust, on the
contrary, composed by gneisses, migmatites and large
scale granites, is mainly acid, due to the fusion of the

aluminous metasediments and little recycling of previ-
ously formed crust. The granitoid domain of this
Ebumean crust seems to reveal incompatibility with
kimberlite emplacement.

With this in mind, a description is made about the
main tectono-stratigraphic units that constitute the craton
and the corresponding orogenic events, with the aim of
dissociating the cratonic core from the various frag-
ments, successively accreted through Precambrian times.

This distinction is of particular importance, because the
relation between the geothermal gradient and the
diamond equilibrium curve defines stability zones for
this mineral under the craton ic cores and instability zones
under the mobile belts (HAGGERTY, 1986).

Archean cratonic nucleus

The diamondiferous area of Lunda is situated in the
Congo Craton, which comprises an Archaean mafic
charnockitic complex . Around this Archaean core several
gneissic -migmatitic series and Palaeoproterozoic grani-
toids were accreted whereas Meso- or Neoproterozoic
metasedimentary belts were disposed around the external
limits of the Congo Craton.

The oldest isotopic data (Rb/Sr and U/Pb) indicates
an age between 2.9 - 2.85 Ga for the chamockitisation of
the mafic complex (norites, tonalites and amphibolites)
(DELHAL &amp;amp; LEDENT, 1971; DELHAL et al., 1976). In
general , this complex is composed of acid and mafic
granulites , quartzites, amphibolitic gneisses and amphi-
bolites .

Near the border with the Congo Democ ratic Republic
a suite of gneisses , migmatites and granitoids crops out
along the valleys of Chicapa and Luachimo and are
included in the so called Dibaya Group of the Kassai
region (Congo), and associated with the mafic char-
nockitic complex. Here, the U/Pb concordia, obtained
from zircons and titanites, suggest an age of 2.65 Ga
(DELHAL et al., 1975).

In addition to the mafic chamokitic complex and the
Dibaya rocks, some authors (MONFORTE, 1988) consider
the existence, in the Lunda area, of an older Basal
Complex composed of amphibolitic schists, gneisses,
migmatites and granitoids, which is not, in our opinion,
separate from the Dibaya Group in terms of its lithology,
metamorphism and structure . In fact, in the referred
units, the foliation has a NE-SW to ENE-WSW direction
and is affected by various deformational phases with
hinge folds oriented NW-SE and NNE-SSW, probably
due to superposition of later orogenic cycles. Therefore,
the ages of the basic magmatism and the original crust of
the Basal Complex and/or the Dibaya Group may be
older, but that crust was certainly regenerated, structured
and metamorphosed in a large period oftime (2.9 ± 0.2 Ga).
The metamorphism is amphibolitic or granulitic facies
with the presence of acid granulites (chamockites) and
gneissic intermediate-basic rocks (tonalites and norites)

193

that can be explained by a process analogous to the for-
mation of the present-day magmatic arcs and subsequent
mechanisms of subduction / A-type collision (KRONER,
1981; 1983).

The various mobile belts, Luizian-Ubendian (Ebur-
nean) , Kibarian and Pan-African that are successively
accreted to the Congo cratonic core have a weak expres-
sion in the Lunda region . However, they are worth
conside ring, due to the fact that some of the structures
that preserve the metasedimentary sequences representa-
tive ofthose tectonic events correspond to grabens whose
faulted limits control the kimberlite emplacement.

Eburnean-Ubendian Cycle

The behaviour of the Archaean crust, present in
Lunda and other zones of the centre and west of Angola,
relative to the development of the successive orogenic
cycles (CARVALHO &amp;amp; ALVES , 1993) is further analysed .

During the period of Archaean-Proterozoic transition
it suffers extension, mantle pounding, rupture and, in
some cases, intrusion of mafic-ultramafic masses, for
example, the gabbro -anorthositic complex of SW Angola
with a N-S direction along an extension of more than
200 km, and, certainly, some of the mafic intrusions of
Lunda. These great mantle masses induce partial fusion
of the Archaean crust and formation of granitoids and
granodioritic porphyries that, in the westem part of
Angola, clearly marks the fragmentation of that same
crust. In the Lunda sector, that fragmentation has a
WSW-ENE general orientation and gives way to impor-
tant subsiding zones, where sedimentary, generally silici-
clastic, sequences accumulate, and are now outcropping
as medium to high-grade metamorphic rocks accreted to
the Archaean nucleus during the Ebumean-Ubendian oro-
geny. In Lunda, these are divided, from the base upwards
in the Lower Metamorphic Group (L6vua/Luiza Group)
and the Upper Metamorphic Group (Lulua Group):

The L6vua Group, equivalent to the Luiza Group of
Kassai , is also present in Mufo, Luembe River, in the
prolongation of the Kassai Group (Delhal and Ledent,
1973; Andre , 1993). It is composed of a thick sequence
of quartzites, itabirites, micaceous schists and, in some
places, amphibolites and gneisses. The Rb/Sr metamor-
phism age ofthese sequences is ca. 2.2 ± 0.1 Ga (DELHAL
&amp;amp; LEDENT, 1973).

Also in Congo, close to the NE Angola border, a
graben with the same WSW-ENE fracture direction,



194

separated from the Dibaya Group by the Malafudi fault,
preserves a low-grade metasedimentary sequence, named
the Lulua Group . It is composed of schists , quartzites and
basic volcanic rocks (continental tholeiites) considered
as Kibarian (DELHAL &amp;amp; LEGRAND, 1957; FIEREMANS,
1958; 1986) and always considered connected to the
metasediments that occur in the Luembe River, in Angola
(ANDRADE, 1953a; MONFORTE, 1988). However, the
Rb/Sr dating of the metamorphism affecting the basic
volcanic rocks yielded an age of 1901 ± 41 Ma (AND RE,
1993). This author admits that the deposition of the low-
grade metasedimentary sequence may express, locally,
the global extensive phase that displaced the Archaean
lithospheric plates and permitted the confined deposition
of the metasedimentary sequences here analysed.
Concluding, these sequences, affected by successive
tectono-metamorphic episodes, are designated generi-
cally in Angola as the Lower Metamorphic Group of
Lunda, and distinguished from the Basal Complex. They
may be the expression, in the interior of the Congo Craton,
of the tectono-metamorphic episode, accompanied by
intense granitization, that developed to the west of the
craton and, also, in the surroundings of the Tanzania
Craton , being the equivalent to the more vast Ubendian-
Eburnean cycle (2.0 ± 0.2 Ga) . The syn-tectonic porph y-
ritic granites of Lunda may belong to the same cycle.

In the Cambulo-Cassanguidi region, on both margins
of the Luembe River, outcrops the most complete
sequence of the Upper Metamorphic Group of Lunda
(CARVALHO, 1984), previously named "Metamorphic
Series of NE Angola" (RODRIGUES &amp;amp; PEREIRA, 1973;
MONFORTE, 1988). The present group includes two series ,
a lower and an upper, each of which consists of three
formations . Thus, the lower series consists of: A 1a - gneis-
ses and amphibolitic schists, quartz-feldspathic schists and
phyllites, carbonaceous schists and phyllites; Alb - fine-
grained quartzites; Al c - purple, red or grey schists and
phyllites. The upper series is discordant over the lower
series and consists of: A2a - phyllites and sandy schists
with intercalations of conglomerates; A2b - phyllites,
talc-schists and quartz-phyllites; A2c - local silicified
limestones. These rocks were folded and schistosed in a
main deformational event with NE-SW to NNE-SSW
direction, although later fragile folding and kinks with
NNW-SSE and WNW-ESE directions are observable.

. From the earlier works on Lunda (ANDRADE, 1953a;
MONFORTE, 1960) resulted a tendency to associate the
Upper Metamorphic Group of Lunda to the Kibarian
cycle , designating it "Kibaras System". Geological

mapping by RODRIGUES &amp;amp; PEREIRA (1973) raised suspi-
cion that there were two distinct groups, the lowest being
the oldest. On the other hand , the classical works ,
although including the sequence in the Kibarian cycle,
always matched it to the Lulua Group (POLINARD, 1934;
FIEREMANS , 1958; DELHAL, 1973), that is now considered
older than previously admitted (ANDRE, 1993). In the
same sequence, basic (doleritic and gabbro-dioritic)
intrusions with K/Ar isotopic ages of 1320 ± 36 Ma and
1490 ± 40 Ma (CARVALHO et al., 1983) strengthen this
hypothesis. According to these authors, these ages may
correspond to an Ar loss during the Kibarian cycle and
the rocks would therefore correspond to the Eburnean
(CAHEN et al., 1984).

Pan-African Cycle

Regarding the sedimentogenesis of the Pan-African
cycle (KRONER &amp;amp; CORREI A, 1980; BLACK, 1984;
PORADA, 1989), in Lunda there are only the outcrops of
the Saurimo region , on the Chicapa River, to the south;
the ensemble Luangando-Luana, on the Luachimo and
Luana rivers; and those of the Cassanguidi region , on the
Cartuchi-Camaungo streams, tributaries of the Luembe
River, to the north. They allowed to define: the Luana
Formation, composed of conglomerates, salmon-colou-
red quartzites, immature red sandstones, phyllites and red
or black schists; and the Cartuchi-Camaungo Formation,
also consisting from the base to top of conglomerates,
greywackes, quartzites , ferruginous feldspathic sand-
stones and schists with purple colour. Both units are
perfectly equivalent to each other, exhibit low-grade
metamorphism and preserve primary structures such as
graded bedding and cross-stratification, which indicate
shallow platform deposition. They were preserved in
extensive grabens with WSW-ENE general orientation
and, more rarely, NE-SW orientation. The deformation is
insignificant without the development of schistosity that
only becomes penetrative in the pelitic layers.

Based on the analysis of the lithostratigraphic
sequence, these units may be considered equivalent to
the Xisto-Gresoso Group of the W Congo Super-Group
(SCHERM ERHORN, 1981). The age of the Luana Formation
was temporarily considered by ANDRADE (1953a) as post-
" Metamorphic Series of NE Angola" and pre-Karroo,
concerning the fact that the clasts present in the Luana
conglomerate revealed fine-grained quartzites, typical of
those series, and also, due to the fact that the Lower
Karroo tillite (Lutoe Group) contains fragments of
quartzites and schists of the Luana Formation.



Congo Basin

Pre-Atlantic evolution

The Congo Basin (VEATCH, 1935) has its origin in
Gondwana's interior. This basin is surrounded by the
Francevillien, Sembien, Liki-Bembe and Urundi-Kiba-
rien mobile belts from the Kibarian orogenic cycle
(1 .2 ± 0.2 Ga), and by the West Congolian, Oubangui-Lin-
dien, Bushimaien and Katangien mobile belts from the
Pan-African orogenic cycle (850 - 450 Ma). Posterior to
the last deformational phase of this latter cycle, the basin
admits little deposition in the middle Ordovician with a
sandy marine transgressive sequence overlain by pelagic
mud sediments and, at the top, by arkoses (Banalia
Arkoses) that prograde in the basin from the E and W.
The age of these arkosic sandstones is essentially
Silurian-Devonian (DALY et al., 1992).

195

Since this period, the depositional situation changed
remarkably and the Congo Basin becomes a strongly
subsiding area, due to the large-scale extensive tectonics ,
induced by distant continental collisions, such as the
collision of Laurentia-Baltica with Gondwana in the
Devonian-Carboniferous and the collision of Patagonia
with the Gondwana in the Triassic. The completely conti-
nental sedimentological evolution and the endorheic
drainage originated a thick sedimentary sequence, which
in some sections attained approximately 9 km in thick-
ness (DALY et al., 1992).

During the Carboniferous and Permian the cratonicbase-
ment was covered by the continental terrigenous sequences
of the Karroo and Continental Intercalar Group. In the
particular case of Angola, and in the diamondiferous area
of the Lunda province , it is possib le to find some frag-
ments of a glacio-fluvial and lacustrine-deltaic sequences,
correlated with the Karroo (LEPERSONNE, 1951), preserved
in tectonic fault-bounded structures (Table 2). This

sequence ends with hypabissal and volcanic episodes of
continental thole iites . In the places without volcanism, a
new flu vio -lacustrine sequence appears , which was
named, in Angola, the Continental Intercalar Group.

This lithostratigraphic unit was informally defi ned by

Diamang geologists (M ONFORTE, 1960 ; 1988) , compris-

ing terrigenous deposits, bounded by a tectonic uncon-

formity with the underlying Karroo Supergroup,

pre served in graben structures, and w ith the overlying

Kwango Group. Previously, the Continental Intercalar

Group (Table 3) was con sidered as pertaining to Karroo,
as upper Cassange or mismatched with the so called

"Lunda Stage" (ANDRADE, 1953b). The important work

ma de by REAL (1959) gave a decisive contribution to the

knowledge of those continental units and, particularly, to
the definition of the ango lan Karroo deposits . In the

established lithostratigraphic column, he does not

include , however, an y sequence that may be correlated to
the old Lualaba Seri es (old designation for the set of

Stanleyville and Loia Groups).
In the Congo Democratic Republic (former Zaire),

drilling work s allow the definition of the Stanleyville, Loia

and Bokungu Groups (CAHEN et al. , 1960 ; CAHEN, 1981 ;
1983) . La ter, DALY et al. (1991) proposed the strati-
graphic rank of Formation to those units, with the mainte-
nance of the unit names (Table 3). In the Kassai region,
the Loia Group overlies the Stanleyville Group by a very
low angle unconformity. The Bokungu Group overlies both
by an unconformity (CAHEN, 1983). The chronostratigra-
phy of those units are based on Phyllopodes biozones,
which allow the redefin ition of the Lualaba Series.

We think that, in Angola, man y of the continental
terrigenous deposits included in th e Cas sange III
(MOUTA, 1954) or included in the "Camadas com
Filopodes" of several authors that have worked in the

Cassange or Lu nda regions, cou ld and must be revised,

similarly to what happened in the Congo Central Basin.
There is a lack of detail ed stratigraphic and bio strati-

graphic work, refinement of tectonic interpretation and ,

finall y, formal definition of stratigraphic units.

The Continental Int ercalar Group outcrops in exten -

sive areas of the Cassange reg ion . In Lunda, it can also

be seen in several localities along the Chicapa, Luachimo

and Lovua Rivers, rang ing several ten s of meters (REAL,

1959; MONFORTE, 1988). Despite the referred ambiguity,

the units sequence, observable on the left margin of the
Cassamba River - east margin tributary of Chicapa River
near Calonda village - are, from base to top (PEREIRA et
al., 2000b) (Table 3):

• Sandy mudstones with conglomerates, breccias and
red claystones with alternating layers of whitish
and reddish sandstones (= 10 m) ;

• White kaolinised arkoses and red sandstones with
levels of brown mudstones (= 6 m);

• Reddish clays and sands with microconglomeratic
intercalations (= 4 m).

These sequences and the respective basement were
strongly segmented by extensive tectonics , coeval with the
opening of the South Atlantic . Several fault-bounded struc-
tures (grabens and semi -grabens) trending mostly
WSW-ENE and NNW-SSE were originated, which
preserve the pre-Cretaceous sediments. These structural
alignments, mostly inferred from the occurrence of the

Karroo and Continental1ntercalar deposits, have extreme
importance for they favour kimberlite emplacement and,
consequently, are excellent guides for kimberlite explo-
ration.

Several of these and other main structural lineaments
and structures correspond to inherited structures from
previous tectonic episodes.

Congo Craton pre-Atlantic deformation

Inevitably, the Congo Craton exhibits the main struc-
tural trends that characterized the orogenic cycles referred
to before : WSW-ENE directions from the Archaean; NW-
SE trend from the Eburnean structures and N-S to NNW-
SSE directions from the Pan-African cycle . These are the
directions of the tectonic flow, which imply specific
tension fields for each cycle that will not be mentioned
here. Due to the rigid rheology of the main cratonized
blocks intervening in the Pan-African cycle, the fragile
structures of this cycle play an important role in the frag-
mentation of the Congo Craton . It will be reactivated in the
tectonic episodes acting over the Gondwana, after
Cambrian times , which culminate with the opening of the
south Atlantic. Amongst these episodes it is worth empha-

sizing the continental collisions that occurred in the
Devonian-Carboniferous and in the Triassic.

197

The main inherited structures and fractures (COWARD

&amp;amp; DALY, 1984) are represented in Fig. 2. It is with the
analyses of the reactivation of the fractures that the
control of the kimberlite emplacement is made.

i) - Inherited structures

The oldest structures and, certainly, those of major
importance in the structural control of kimberlite
diamond sources, and consequently in the distribution of
secondary deposits, are those that define the WSW-ENE
direction of the Lucapa Graben (DELVILLE , 1961 ;
MONFORTE, 1970). However, this structure is not
confined to the Lunda area , and extends from the mouth
of the Cuanza River, in Angola, to the Kassai, in the
Congo Republic (WASILEWSKY, 1950). The age of this
structure is, at least, related to the Pan-African Cycle, but
could be older than this, because the Charnockitic
Complex and the Dybaia Group (= 2.9 ± 0.2 Ga) are
preserved inside the Lucapa Graben. During the Pan-
African, the tension field responsible for the W Congo
and Damara mobile belts, implies a maximum tension
orientated WSW-ENE. These forces must have produced
extension movements in the Lucapa Graben, that lead to
the preservation of the Charnockitic Complex and , also,
the Luana / Cartuchi-Camaungo Formation.

ii) - Consequences of the Laurentia-Baltica collision
with the Gondwana during the Devonian-Carboniferous

This collisional process originated the Variscan chain ,
essentially developed in central and west Europe, and
also the Appalachian chain and the Morocco-Mauritania
Atlas Mountains, evolving, respectively, the eastern part
of North America and the northern part of Africa.

In present-day geography, the placement of the Afri-
can Hercynian chains, with dominant W-E to ENE-WSW
structural trends for the major structures, implies a maxi-
mum compression with a NNW-SSE direction. As a
consequence of continental uplift, foreland basins or
simple continental depressions are formed in the
orogenic front. Examples of this situation are the epicon-
tinental basins that occupy the whole northern part of
Africa, namely, the Tindouf, Algeria and Taoudeni basins
(CAPUTO &amp;amp; CROWELL, 1985).

It is plausible that those NNW-SSE tensions could have
some consequences on the Congo Basin, reactivating the
inherited Pan-African structures as tensile fractures
along the main faults with that direction. In fact , the
occurrence of the tillites and fluvio-glacial deposits of

the Lutoe Group, outcropping along the Chicapa River in
Lunda, are preserved in fault-bounded structures with
NNW-SSE directions.

On the other hand, faults with NW-SE and NNE-SSE
directions could be reactivated with wrench movements,
while the WSW-ENE faults act as compression structures.

iii) - Consequences of the Patagonia - Gondwana
collision in the Triassic

This collisional event originated the Cape Town
orogen with a WNW-ESE structural trend (DALY et al.,
1991), and also had consequences on the Congo Basin.

In fact, in the southern limit of the basin, in the Angolan
territory within the basin, several structures could be
seen and are perhaps more important than those formerly
described (REAL, 1959).

The most recent of these structures, with NNE-SSW
direction and which exert a tectonic control over the
Cassange Group of Permian-Triassic age, could be inter-
preted as tensile fractures related with the distal
Patagonia-Gondwana collision.

Subordinate to the present tension field, the NNW-SSE
and WSW-ENE fractures, may still be activated as
wrench faults, dextral and sinistral, respectively.



The Triassic age for this reactivation followed by a
reverse sense extension, near the W-E direction, preser-
ves the Cassange Group deposits, and favours the ascent
of magmatism and volcanism of the upper Karroo, and
controls the Mesozoic sedimentogenesis. These struc-
tures are also fundamental for the control of kimberlite
emplacement that mainly affects along the NNW-SSE
and WSW-ENE conjugated directions (MONFORTE, 1970;
REIS, 1972).

Thus , continental rifting begins in the Jurassic . The
Congo Basin is under confined traction, crustal rupture
and continental tholeiitic magmatism and volcanism
occurs and sedimentation is interrupted. The opening of
the northern Atlantic is coeval with these geological
events. The continental rifting in the south Atlantic and in
Angola begins in the Cretaceous, pre-Aptian (BROGNON
&amp;amp; VERRI ER, 1965; PEREIRA, 1971).

In the Albian , the opening of the south Atlantic
continues and sedimentation of the Continental Intercalar
Group occurs simultaneously. After the Albian, in the
passive Atlantic margin, and particularly in the Cuanza
Basin , alkaline and hyperalkaline intrusions and lava
flows (PEREIRA, 1969; PEREIRA &amp;amp; MOREIRA, 1978) are
found intercalated in the sedimentary units. These are
reliably dated by post-Albian and possibly Cenomanian
fossil fauna (LAPAO &amp;amp; GALVAO, 1971). In the same
period, in the Congo basin, kimberlite and carbonatite
volcanic activity starts, associated with the "volcanic belt
of Angola" (MACHADO, 1959). This age is corroborated
by Rb/Sr radiometric dating in several places in Angola,
such as 87 ± 11 Ma, in phonolites (SILVA, 1973) and 92 ± 7
Ma, in tinguaites from the carbonatite ring structure of
Catanda (SILVA &amp;amp; PEREIRA, 1971).

Subsequently to this period of strong tectono-
volcanic and sedimentary activity at the end of the
Cretaceous, followed a strong cycle of erosion during
which the regional relief was eroded and the region was
covered by thick sedimentary mud-sand-conglomerate
sequences of the Kwango and Kalahari Groups. As a
result, only the erosional activity of the present drainage
pattern allows the crystalline basement, the alkaline and
kimberlite volcanic structures, and also the first sedi-
mentary collector of diamonds, the Calonda Formation,
to outcrop (Table 3).

Kimberlite / Lamproite emplacement in Angola

The emplacement ages ofthe kimberlites in the world
are well known (KIRKLEY et al., 1992; FIPKE et al. , 1995;
GURN EY, 1989; MEYER, 1985; 1987) with three Precam-

199

brian ages, a succession of Palaeozoic ages and several
Meso-Cenozoic ages with a main Cretaceous period of
emplacement. On the other hand, the isotopic ages
obtained from diamond inclusions clearly reveal that
the diamond ages are generally comprised between
3300-990 Ma . In some cases those ages are much
older than the kimberlites that transport the diamond
up to the surface, with ages more frequently between
100-90 Ma (RICHARDSON et al., 1984; RICHARDSON et
al ., 1990).

It is possible to synthesise the consequences of the
difference between the ages of the diamonds and the ages
of their transport to the surface: i) the diamond is origi-
nated and stored in the mantle during long periods of
time; ii) it is transported to the surface in specific periods
(inter-orogenic) of Earth's history; iii) diamonds of
different ages occur in the same pipe, as in the case of the
Finch mine (RICHARDSON et al., 1990), which implicates
the existence of several mantle sources crossed by the
same kimberlite during ascencion ; iv) and , finally, the
diamonds are not genetically related with the kimberlites,
that serve only as a transportation medium up to the
surface. The diamond sampling in the mantle is done by
a mechanism of geothermal gradients and thermody-
namic conditions for diamond stability (KENNEDY &amp;amp;
KENNEDY, 1976; HAGGERTY, 1986).

In the distribution map of kimberlites and alkaline
ring structures in Angola (Fig. 3), it is possible to see the
seven kimberlite provinces that are presently known
(REIS, 1972; REIS &amp;amp; BARROS, 1981).

The four most important of those provinces are:
Lunda (I) ; Cucumbi, Cacuilo and Cuango Rivers region
(II); Cuanza Basin (Ill) and the Cunene, Queve and
Catumbela River springs region (IV). These provinces
are aligned along one NE-SW macrostructure
( L u n d a - Walvis Bay lineament or Volcanic Belt of
Angola). The Lunda province is controlled by fault-
bounded compartments with WSW-ENE direction in
an echelon pattern, dislocated by NNW-SSE faults .
The other three main provinces (II, III and IV) are
tectonically controlled by NE-SW and NW-SE frac-
tures.

The remaining provinces: Longa River springs (V),
Cassinga region (VI) and Cubango River springs (Vll) ,
are tectonically controlled by NW-SE fractures . Together
with provinces III and IV, they form a structural linea-
ment with this same orientation.

In the crossing of these two systems of major frac-
tures several kimberlite pipes were found using airborne

magnetic surveys (REIs, 1971). The Atlantic traction
forces cause the formation of graben-type structures that
were formerly described, that control and preserve the
secondary deposits of diamonds: Kwango Group, river
terraces and present alluvial deposits.

From the exposed, we emphasise the strong structural
control for the kimberlite emplacement. The main weak-
ness fracture zones where the kimberlites are found were
inherited from Precambrian orogens and from the tensile
fracture systems actuating in the Congo craton between

the Carboniferous-Permian and the Cretaceous (PEREIRA
et al., 2000a).

In Lunda, there are several petrographic facies of kim-
berlite: porphyritic type, breccias and tuff-breccias. The
mode of occurrence ofkimberlites is mainly in diatremes
or pipes, but dikes and sills are also known. The pipes are
elliptical or circular, irregular, with variable dimension
and are generally small in size. However, the Catoca,
Camafuca-Camazambo, Camutue, Camatchia-Camagico
pipes form the exception in this area as these are much



larg er in size ; uneroded and consist of groups of
diatremes. Their composite nature gives them the larger
dimension. The dikes and sills are thin find can attain
lengths up to one hundred meters , showing a porphyritic
structure and few xenoliths. Generally these are relat ed
with fracture lineaments or have a radial disposition in
relation to the larger pipes , as in the case of Camutue,

As far as we know there is no isotopic data on kim-
berlit es from Ang ola . The kimberlites are prob ably post-
Paleo zoic since in the Chicapa River, the Camafuca-Cama-
zambo kimberl ite , the Karroo and the Continental
Interc alar depo sits are cros s cut by the diatreme (REAL,
1959). We therefore presume that the Lunda kimberlites
and, in general, the Angolan kimberlites are emplaced in
the Cretaceous period with the opening of the South
Atlantic.

Further age indication comes from the relat ion of the
kimberlite occurrences within the "Volcanic Belt of
Angola", a major structure in Angolan geology, which
plays an important role in the kimberlite magmatism.

The "Hotspot"/ "Thinspot" of Walvis Bay - Rio
Grande do Sui , has been known for a long time as the
"Volcanic Belt of Angola" (MACHADO, 1959; EDWARDS,
1971; CORREIA, 1988). The evolution of this hot spot is
refle cted in the strong differentiation that can be seen
along the Volcanic Belt from NE to Sw. In the north-
eastern kimberlite provinces, there are rich exploitable
kimberlites in Lunda (I) and in Bakwanga (Congo
Democratic Republic) (WASILEWSKY, 1950); poor kimber-
lites with diamond and pyrope in Cucumbi, Cacuilo and
Cuango (II); kimberlites with pyrope and subordinate
diamond in the Cuanza basin (III); practically sterile
kimberlites in the Cunene; Queve and Catumbela River
springs (IV) ; and, finally , concentric structures with
nepheline syenites and carbonatites in the south-western
part of the Lunda - Walvis Bay lineament, such as:
Zen za , Nonga, Elonga, Balombo, Longojo , Bonga,
Tchivira , Serra da Neve, Virulundo (LOUREIRO, 1967).
These occurrences seem to confirm MILASHEV (1965) and
BARDET (1973-1977) ideas. The variation in geothermal
gradient from the centre to the external part of the craton
and the fraction ation of the alkaline magma, associated
with the conditions of diamond stability w ith the phase
transformation of diamond in graphite , is totally
confirmed in space and time in Ang ola (Fig. 3).

There is a question related with the time of this
magma evolution between the Lunda and the Namibe
region (PEREIRA, 1969). An Albian age (110 Ma) is
admitted for the Lunda kimberlite intrusions while the

201

alkaline magmatism of Walvis Bay is of Cenom a-
nian- Turonian age. If we consider an expansion rate of
10 ern/year for the South Atlantic and/or equal velocity in
the NE movement of the African Plate , the distance of
appro ximately 2000 km between Lunda and Walvis Bay
is overcome in 10 Ma. The se numbers point out the
validity of the hypothesis of an enormous magmatic
diapir in expansion that must establish the control of the
diamond in Ang ola.

A ll these geological episodes are related to the open-
ing of the Atlantic. In fact the breaking up of Pangea and
the opening of the Atlantic caused intens e fracturing in
the African continent, with a triple joint near Lake Chad
and three radial megastructures: one in the direction of
Tunis , another till the Fernando PO islands and the third ,
more irregular, that pa sses through Mombassa (Fig. 4a ).
This megafracturing originated three more or less
cratonic megablocks: Occ idental (0. B.); Ar abian-Nubic
(A. N . B.) and Austral (A. B.). In the Neocomian-Aptian
occurred the separation between the Arabian-Nubian and
Austral blocks , causing a left wrench movement in the
Chad- Tunis structure; in the upper Aptian-lower
Albian , by NE-SW extension, the separation between the
Occidental and the Arabic-Nubi an block s occur s, imply-
ing the development of the dextral transform fault that
separates the Occidental and Arabian-Nubic blocks from
the Austral block (Fig. 4b) (FAIRHEAD, 1988; UNTERNEHR
etal. , 1988; GIRA UD &amp;amp; MAURIN, 1991).

Since the Albian , the Atlantic opening process induces
intensive W-E tensile activity in the Austral crustal block
(MARTIN, 1973; OJEDA, 1982; REYRE, 1984), which, in
tum , is also divided in at least three other crustal cratonic
blocks: Congo , Tanzania and Kalahari (Fig. 2). The Congo
and Tanzania cratonic blocks are also separated from the
Kalahari craton by the Mwembeshi left transform fault,
particularly active in Pan-African times and responsible
for the formation of the Damara belt (KRONER, 1982), and
the Lufilian Arc (COWARD &amp;amp; DALY, 1984). The tensile
forces reactivate weakness zone s inherited from the
Precambrian orogenic cycles and from the continental
collisions with Gondwana, formerly referred.

Concerning the Congo craton, and in the specific case
of Angola, the main weakness zones defined are: WSW-
EN E, NW-SE and NN E-SSW. Under the W-E tensile
forces , coeval with the Atlantic opening, the WSW-ENE
fractures will react mainly with wrench movements ,
while the other become mainly tensile.

Considering all these facts and models it is worth
emphasising some ideas about the most successful method s

of primary diamond source exploration in Lunda. In view
of the previous ideas and assumptions on the major
geological controls of kimberlite emplacement, the most
favourable areas are those that have a cratonic basement,
and alkaline volcanism associated with deep transcurrent
or extensive tectonics. In Lunda, very thick post-kimber-
lite terrigenous sediments, deep weathering profiles and
dense vegetal cover obscure these geological conditions.
This inevitably leads to choosing geophysical methods of
kimberlite exploration over other conventional methods.

Importance ofairborne magnetic surveys

This method of exploration revealed itself very useful
in the location of the major lineaments that control the
ascent and emplacement ofkimberlites. Thus, this method
was decisive to the discovery of volcanic alkaline struc-
tures where those rocks are found. In fact, the crystalline
complexes have, throughout geological time, been

subjected to different diastrophic phases that have modi-
fied the physical properties ofthe various lithologicalunits .
These changes have been brought out by metasomatic
phenomena and magmatic differentiation process (RBIS,
1966). On the other hand, the basic and ultrabasic comple-
xes, as shown by their circular alkaline-carbonatite struc-
tures, have had a history of tectonic control along the main
lines of structural weakness, together with magmatic dif-
ferentiation (RBIS, 1971; RBIS &amp;amp; BARROS, 1981; REfS &amp;amp;
MONFORTE, 1981).

The main suite of volcanic rocks consist predomi-
nantly of andesitic laves, rhyolites and gabbros which
are related to the alkaline complexes and the nepheline
syenites, ijolites, trachytes, phonolites, breccias, tuffs,
carbonatites and kimberlites. The carbonatites and
kimberlites associations under similar tectonic condi-
tions has been discussed by several authors (DAWSON,
1980; BARDET, 1973; NIXON, 1987; KORNPROBST,
1984).

A good example of the aeromagnetic application for
kimberlite detection is shown in Fig. 5, which gives a
zoom sketch map from the Uambo region, in central
Angola.

The structural map shows all the geological and
geophysical data and delimits the three main WSW-ENE,

Kwango Group - Calonda Formation

The Calonda Formation (CF) is considered the first
sedimentary collector of diamonds , and is correlative with
the continental diastrophism and supergenic destruction of
kimberlite diamond sources. As a consequence, the CF
colIects the products of surface destruction of kimberlites
and lamproites (D ELVILLE, 1973; RODRIGUES, 1993).

The Calonda Fm sedimentogenesis is, thus, con-
trolIed by the filling-up of fault-bounded large depres-
sions that originated by extensional tectonics coeval with
the opening of the South Atlantic (REIS et al. , 2000).

The Calonda stratigraphic sequence is composed
mainly of torrential deposits, correlated and proximal to
the elevations, that express high energy and transport
capacity in a dense and viscous medium, where angular
coarse and fine clasts are transported by a dense argilla-
ceous mass , in water suspension. It show stages of great
recurrence, with conglomeratic and argilIaceous interca-
lations, as the relief becomes less pronounced. Gradually,
the sedimentogenesis gains lagoonal characteristics
downstream, as a result of the grouping and coalescence
of weak currents coming from lower lands.

In a mature stage of pediplanation, in the Upper
Cretaceous, this type of deposit implies an abundance of
regolith and a great rainfall volume, as was interpreted
from the textural maturity ofthe arenaceous sequences and
from the sedimentary structures, namely cross-bedding.

At the top of the CF sequence, the limonitic, silcrete
and calcrete levels , indicates the larger frequency of dry
seasons and the complete disappearance of surface
waters. Generally, the sedimentological column ends
with terrigenous sandy-argillaceous materials with sparse
angular pebbles. These uppermost levels correspond to a
low energy laminar flow transport with aeolian transport
episodes. .

The Calonda Formation was informally defined in
Lunda (NE Angola) (ANDRADE, 1953a, b; 1954). In the
Democratic Republic of Congo, together with other
lithostratigraphic units , it is placed in the frame of the
Congo Basin and it has been included in the Kwango
Group (MONFORTE et al ., 1979; CAHEN, 1983), with an
age considered as Cenomanian, on the basis of fish
macrofossils and palynomorphs. In the latter years of the
DIAMANG mining activities, several detailed studies
were carried out from a lithostratigraphic and economic
point of view (SARAIVA, 1973).

The Calonda Fm lithostratigraphy, with an average
thickness of about 40-60 meters , is the base upwards:

205

• Coarse fanglomerate / conglomerate, with a sandy-
-clay matrix showing several different sedimento-
logical types whose definition and classification
was proposed by several authors (e. g. FIEREMANS,
1955; MONFORTE, 1960; SARAIVA, 1973) . In most
cases the basal conglomerate produces diamonds
and some attempts were made in order to relate the
sedimentological type of each conglomerate with
its diamond content.

• Sequences of immature arenites with rare mudstone
intercalations; the sandstones have cross stratifica-
tion and several colours that vary from place to place :
violet coloured muddy arenites; white arkosic-kao-
linitic arenites and reddish limonitic arenites;

• Fine-grained conglomerate recurrences, with an
argillaceous matrix;

• Argillaceous component increasing upwards with
sandy-argillaceous levels with limonitic horizons,
silcretes and calcretes indicating dry periods.

• Predominance of argillaceous and sandy-argilla-
ceous levels with brownish colours at the top of the
sequence. Sometimes with dispersed pebbles.

Kalahari Group

The lithostratigraphy, sedimentology and tectonics of
the formations included in the Kalahari Group must be
studied in the light of the global climate changes that
occurred during its sedimentation. In fact, the Kalahari
sedimentogenesis is coeval with the main erosive periods
that have sculptured the relief, resulting in vast planes. It
is the knowledge of the chronology of these planes
surfaces, coeval with depositional hiatus and together
with climatic changes that must be present in the study of
the Kalahari Group.

The formal definition of the units of the so-called
Kalahari System, was made in the Conference of Geo-
logists of the Congo Basin in 1945 (LEPERSONNE , 1945)
and completed later by CAHEN et al. (1946) . These authors
proposed three main divisions for the Kalahari , which
resulted in the three formations considered until today :

• Kalahari C (superieur) - Kalahari Sands

• Kalahari B (intermedium) - "Gres Polimorphyiques"

• Kalahari A (inferieur) - Kamina Formation



206

The lower Kalahari is not present in Lunda or, what
seems no probable, it is confused with the top of the
Calonda Formation. This lack of definition could be due
to the facies similarities when the conglomerate is not
present (MONFORTE, 1960).

Based on the works of several authors (POLINARD,
I 948a, b; MOUTA &amp;amp; DARTEVELLE, 1952; JANMART, 1953;
CARVALHO, 1955; GREKOFF, 1958; DE PLOEY et aI.,
1968), it was possible to define a lithostratigraphy for the
Kalahari of Lunda :

• Upper Series or Ochre Sands Formation, formed
by gravel layers at the base with ochre sands and
yellow sands at the top;

• Lower Series or "Ores Polimorfos" Formation,
composed, from base to top, of conglomerate,
purple sandstones locally silicified, chalcedony and
sandy chalcedony, silicified quartzitic sandstones,
silcretes (FERREIRA, 1958), and white or red friable
sandstones.

An Eocene to Oligo-Miocene age has been consi-
dered for the "Gres Polimorfos" Formation based on
fossil findings , namely Ostracods, Gasteropods, and
oogonic fragments of Chara genera.

From our personal experience in NE Lunda, the tran-
sition between Calonda Fm and the Kalahari Group is
made by a sedimentological unconformity with a weak
erosive event:

- Wherever the contact is observable, it is moderately
undulate;

- There could be several contact lithologies: in the
C. F. sandstones it is possible to find mudstone levels,
cross-bedding, parallel bedding and the presence of
feldspar; in the "Gres Polimorfos", apart from the
strong silicification, these units do not include
mudstones, the feldspars are not visible in hand spe-
cimen and the bedding planes are not perceptible.

- In the basal levels of the "Gres Polimorfos", there
is occasionally a well-rounded gravel made up of
clasts of quartz and quartzite with angular chal-
cedony that contains scarce diamonds.

Post-Pliocene diamondiferous alluvial-eluvial
deposits

In a study ofthese kinds of deposits , it is very impor-
tant to consider the last planation event in the Congo

Basin. This event is post the Ochre Sands Formation,
partly coeval with the late Pliocene pediplanation and
cuts the Miocene and the late Cretaceous peneplains.
Most of the Angolan geomorphology is dominated by
such planation surfaces , with a stepping succession of
planation surfaces from the interior of the country to the
coast. The surfaces are also present in the endorheic
morphology of the Congo Basin .

The Pliocene peneplain is, thus, the best reference
surface for the Quaternary eluvio-alluvial deposits, with
or without diamonds. This surface covered by:

• Very dispersed plateau gravels composed by fer-
ralite elements and clasts of "Gres Polimorfos";
these deposits express the last stage of planation
once the finer elements have been removed by the
wind and the surface-waters;

• Sands covering the former plateau gravels, some-
times with several meters of thickness. These sands
occur between altitudes of 800-900 m, and are of
aeolian origin, resulting from the redistribution of
Kalahari sands in an arid climate .

The maximum altitude of the Pliocene surface marks
the dividing line between the main Lunda rivers flowing
northwards . This surface is cut by the sub-actual and
actual river drainage, with the correspondent planation
levels. Some of these planation levels are marked by
terrace deposits, some of which are economically impor-
tant. MONFORTE (1988), based on previous studies
(POLINARD, 1949; BREUIL &amp;amp; JANMART, 1950; JANMART,
1953), defined these erosion cycles for the Lunda region.

As mentioned previously, humid tropical climates are
favourable for intense alteration while sub-arid climates
generate great masses of regolith. The quaternary
climate, in the region of the Congo Basin, of low lati-
tudes, is characterised by an alternation of these condi-
tions . Therefore, the development of placers and residual
deposits depends on the combination of tectonic move-
ments and climatic conditions (HALL et aI., 1985).

Tectonism takes place in the Holocene . In fact, a tilt
movement to the W, affecting a sector of the Congo
Basin induced the drainage of the great African river to
flow to the Atlantic. From this point on the sedimentation
is definitely altered in the basin and it becomes no longer
endorheic, the level base is lowered and the encasement
of the great tributaries of the Congo River starts . Wide
valleys with flat floors are generated and rapidly the
riverbed is excavated on the friable units of the, also
designated, Central African Basin .



Remobilised Calonda, Kalahari and plateau deposits

The active slope erosion, cutting the easily friable
Calonda and Kalahari deposits , remobilise and deposits
its materials directly over the sloping crystalline base-
ment or in various level terraces.

Frequently, the ore grade diminishes, due to the intro-
duction of large volumes of barren Kalahari sands and
gravels. However, if the erosion is directed on the
Calonda basal conglomerate, a fine deposit with rich ore
grades could be formed on top of the basement. In Fig. 6,
the fine layers originated economically important
diamondiferous deposits .

Upper Terraces (40 to 20 m)

i) - 40 meter terrac es

It contains non-rounded Kafuense industry, pre-
Chelles-Acheulense (JANMART, 1946a, b). Some doubts
persist about the origin of these deposits (LEAKEY, 1948).
In fact, there is a mixture of angular and rounded clasts.
These materials could be slope degradation products , the
rounded materials having come from the pre-Pliocene
units.

ii) - 20 meter terraces

They contain non-rounded Kafuense industry, pre-
Chelles-Acheulense (JANMART, 1946a, b).

Contrary to the former terraces , relative to which
doubts sub sist about the deposition process, these
deposits constitute layers with a thickness that could rise
to three meters, and are undoubtedly deposited by rivers
during their erosion activity until the present level posi-
tion.

These terraces are situated approximately 20 meters
above the present riverbed level, on top of the crystalline
basement and they are very common in NE Angola.

Their economical value is higher than that of the
40 meter terraces.

Main rivers low-level terraces (~ 10 m)

They contain Oldwense industry and some other
types of Chellense and Chelles-Acheulense industry.

Betweenthe high terraces and the low terraces depo-
sition, an important time span occurred, during which
important climate changes happened (MONFORTE, 1988).

207

These changes originated an important ferralite level
named "Pleistocene Laterite I", whose genesis was
favoured by the alternating succession and dominance of
the hot dry season over the rainy one.

These terraces, with a thickness between 0.30 and
1.50 meters, rest on top of the crystalline basement or on
top of the referred laterite.

Main rivers alluvial flat and riverbed deposits

Under this title are grouped several depositional
events in several studies (e.g. JANMART, 1946a; LEAKEY,
1948; MONFORTE, 1988).

They are low altitude terraces, with ferralitic levels,
changes in depositional regime of the river courses,
terrigenous intercalations due to the .emersion of the
deposits, etc., essential, without doubt, to the research on
climatology and lithostratigraphy of recent Quaternary
(HALL et al., 1985). Any work in this domain may not do
without this analysis .

In a mining perspective , all of these deposits are
located on the river margins, alluvial flat and on the
present riverbed.

Economical situation analysis of Angolan
diamondiferous deposits

The preceding text is a synthesis of the main aspects
related with a complex geological problem that is the
diamond deposits of Angola. We have made reference to
some scientific and technical matters that must be
considered in the study of the genesis and location of
primary and secondary diamond sources . Below, the
economical consequences of this knowledge in view of
future trends and possibilities for diamond exploration
and exploitation in Angola is discussed .

i) Diamondiferous potential

When Angola became an independent country, on the
lIth of November of 1975, the ore reserves in diamond
were considerable (65 x 106 carats) , and the exploitation
rate reached 2.1 x 106 carats/year. These numbers show
the effectiveness of the DIAMANG mining and explo-
ration activities until the end of its work. The succeeding
Angolan Diamond Mining Company (ENDlAMA) took
large benefits of this heritage to the present-day, if we
take into account that no more intensive significant



208

exploration works have been carried out since 1975.
Despite some rare exceptions the present-day mining
works are still based on the DIAMANG ore reserves.
Today there is no information about new proven reserves
and the depletion of re serves is poorly controlled because
of smuggling.

In 1975 the known proved reserves are , by ore type:

• Primary sources (kimberlites/lamproites) : "" 45 x 106

carats;

• Sedimentary detrital deposits (recent alluvial-elu-
vial gravels , and some area with Calonda Fm basal
gravels): "" 20 x 106 carats.

In relation to these numbers , it is important to notice
that statistical studies carried out in several tens of years
have shown that the exploitation results are 22 % higher
than the one s of exploration. On the other hand, an
increase in 30-40 % of ore proved reserves must be
consid ered , because in almost all the defined mining
blocks the exploitation continues beyond the limits of
these blocks with ore treatment plant ore grade control.

The estimation of probable diamond reserves, was in
1975 :

• Primary sources (kimberlites/lamproites?): "" 40 x 106

carat s;

• Sedimentary detrital depo sits in recent allu vial-elu-
vial gravels (undervalued reserves): "" 7,5 x 106 carats;

• Calonda Fm basal gravels: "" 26 x 106 m3 (a total of
10.4 x 106 carats is estimated), with an average ore
grade of 0.4 ctl m3 and 0.8 m for the conglomerate
thickness with an overburden thickness of about
30 -60 m.

The Calonda Fm basal conglomerate was investi-
gated and sampled by drilling. In face of the ubiquitous
occurrence of this lithostratigraphic horizon in Lunda, it
is eas y to point out the huge potential of Calonda Fm as
a future diamond reserve . The need for an adequate
exploration program is obvious (PEREIRA, 1996; RODRI-
GUES et al., 2000a; RODRIGUES et al., 2000b).

A ll of the previously referred data on the diamond
potential was collected and known onl y due to the work
and exp erience of the DIAMANG geologists and miners
in several scientific areas such as : remote sensing,
geophysics, geochemistry, loaming mineralometry and
also biology (botany and termites) . Together, several
techniques developed in these scientific areas lead to the

discovery of 383 kimberlites, between 1952 and 1973
(176 in 1973). Besides these , 46 new kimberlites were
found by CONDIAMA(a DE BEERS and DIAMANG asso-
ciated Company), in a total of 429 identified kimberlites
until July of 1973, which can be grouped in the following
manner: 2.8 % economically exploitable; 1.2 % under
evaluation studies; 46.6 % without diamonds and 49.4 %
not studied.

At present time , a number about 600 kimberlite
bodies were identified.

ii) Future perspectives

As a result of the generalised illegal miners all over
the country, the secondary diamond deposits related with
the actual river drainage does not represent an economic
source to the country, and, in our opinion, they are in the
future completely lost for any kind of organised indus-
trial scale mining activity. In fact , since 1978 and with an
ever increasing rate , since 1985 that those kinds of ille-
gal mining activities have tak en place in those kind of
depo sits. The consequent inexi stenc e of effective control
on high-grade I little-overburden thickness and well-
sized good-quality stones lead to a " diamondiferous"
chaos in Angola.

A s a result of these illegal acti vitie s, the benefits for
the country were none and even highl y negati ve, due to
the illegal diamond exportat ion to foreign international
markets (Antwerp, Israel , USA , etc) , but also because the
diamonds serve as financial support for other activities.

A few, but important alternatives are left for the
secondary deposits: i) the main river bed deposits, unex-
ploitable without adequate technical support; ii) in rela-
tion to the referred lost reserves, an alternative could be
the establishment of an official buying system, with
attractive prices, that could conteract the illegal diamond
exportation.

Therefore, the good use of the remaining economi-
cally viable kimberlite and Calonda Fm diamond
resources that , due to their specific geological charac-
teristics, are untouchable by illicit miners , is imperative.

In relation to the Calonda Fm , the usually thick over-
burden hinders the activities of illegal diamond pro spec-
tors. There are three main regions of high economical
potential (REIS et al., 2000): NE Lunda , Cuango drainage
basin, and particularly the middle course of the Cuando
River, that allows the establishment of several economi-
cal projects: i) Maludi region (NE Angola) with recog-
nised basal gravels approximating 22 x 106 m-', with
30"'60 m of overburden thickness and extremely good



gem-quality diamonds ; ii) Cuango River basin, between
the Luremo and Cuango villages, with well-known
values of mineralisation and also good quality and size of
diamonds; iii) middle of the Cuando drainage basin as a
potential area for the occurrence of the Calonda basal
gravel, but in a state of incipient geological knowledge.

In relation to the primary sources - kimberlites and
lamproites - we point out the main provinces of location
(REIs, 1972), but it is possible that numerous others are yet
unknown. This type of ore demands a vast and intensive
exploration program aimed at initial area selection and later
with refined exploration methods on a case to case basis.

Our opinion is that when the country become s
socially stabilized, enormous unknown diamondiferous
resources will be reveal ed as a consequence of an
adequate scientific and techni cal program in such a large
area available for exploration.
