Abstract – The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of organic compounds from plant extracts of 
six species and phosphate fertilization on soil phosphorus availability. Pots of 30 cm height and 5 cm diameter 
were fi lled with Typic Hapludox. Each pot constituted a plot of a completely randomized design, in a 7x2 
factorial arrangement, with four replicates. Aqueous extracts of black oat (Avena strigosa), radish (Raphanus 
sativus), corn (Zea mays), millet (Pennisetum glaucum), soybean (Glycine max), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), 
and water, as control, were added in each plot, with or without soluble phosphate fertilization. After seven days 
of incubation, soil samples were taken from soil layers at various depths, and labile, moderately labile and 
nonlabile P fractions in the soil were analysed. Plant extracts led to an accumulation of inorganic phosphorus in 
labile and moderately labile fractions, mainly in the soil surface layer (0–5 cm). Radish, with a higher amount 
of malic acid and higher P content than other species, was the most effi cient in increasing soil P availability. 

Index terms: Raphanus sativus, cover crops, crop rotation, labile phosphorus, low-molecular-weight organic

como conseqüência da adição dos extratos de plantas, principalmente na camada superfi cial (0–5 cm). O nabo 
forrageiro, com maior concentração de ácido málico e maior conteúdo de P no tecido do que outras espécies, 
foi o mais efi ciente em incrementar a disponibilidade de P no solo.

Introduction

Tropical soils are generally very poor in available 
phosphorus (P), and adequate levels of this plant nutrient 
are essential for optimal grain yield. Furthermore, 
P fi xation is very high in tropical soils, mainly due 
to their mineralogy (Novais &amp;amp; Smith, 1999). The 
presence of organic compounds in rhizosphere may 
increase or decrease nutrient availability, depending 
on the characteristics of each organic compound and 

their interactions with the soil (Franchini et al., 2003; 
Moraes et al., 2007). 

The study of low-molecular-weight organic acids 
(LMWOA), and the ability of their carboxylate 
functional groups to interact with soil, by occupying 
anion adsorption sites and competing with phosphate, 
has an expressive importance to increase available P 
in soils (Guppy et al., 2005). The role of carboxylates, 
particularly in relation to P availability, has been clearly 
established in the literature (Guppy et al., 2005); it is 



1380 P.S. Pavinato et al.

regulated by organic acids concentration, number 
of carboxylate groups, soil sorption capacity, and 
persistence in soil, although many of these LMWOA 
are degraded in hours or days (Stevenson, 1967). In 
tropical acidic soils, pH change in rhizosphere and 
LMWOA presence may increase organic P solubility by 
complexing Fe and Al oxides, besides the competition 
for adsorption sites promoted by the carboxylate groups 
(Sposito, 1989; Jones, 1998). 

The main source of organic acids in soil is organic 
matter decomposition, but some root and microbial 
exudates are also important. Generally, organic acids 
concentration in soils is very low (10-3 to 10–5 mol L-1). 
Conversely, LMWOA concentration can be high during 
residue decomposition, immediately after its deposition 
on soil surface (Stevenson, 1967). Otherwise, LMWOA 
are rapidly degraded or complexed in soil, after residues 
deposition (hour our days) (Franchini et al., 2003). 

Plant species normally present root morphological 
and physiological processes for adapting to low soil 
P availability conditions, but the relative importance 
of these processes may differ among plant species 
(Gahoonia et al., 2000). Organic acids from plants 
can increase available P by decreasing adsorption of P 
and by increasing dissolution of relatively insoluble P 
compounds (Bolan et al., 1990), including the effect of 
root and shoot release of LMWOA on break-up of Ca, 
Fe and Al phosphates in soil.

Information about the action of LMWOA effect in 
P availability on Brazilian soils is sparse. The main 
idea to run this kind of experiment was based on works 
from Franchini et al. (2003) and Amaral et al. (2004), 
whose research data showed that organic acids promote 
changes on cations availability in soil. Information 
about phosphorus is important for elucidating some 
factors involving plant and soil reactions, which may 
increase the release and P uptake from less soluble 
fractions, in soil.

Fractionation of P pools in soil, with various 
extractors, is an interesting way to investigate its 
availability and solubility, and to evaluate the effect 
of treatments over a short time. The P fractionation 
procedure, developed by Hedley et al. (1982) and 
adapted by Cross &amp;amp; Schlesinger (1995), has been one 
of the most useful procedures over the last 15 years; 
it allows the extraction of both inorganic P (Pi) and 
organic P (Po) fractions, with labile P being extracted 
fi rst, and the more resistant forms later (Gatiboni et al., 
2007). 

Considering that cover crops have different amounts 
of LMWOA which can be rapidly released to soil, after 
deposition (Stevenson, 1967; Franchini et al., 2003), 
the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects 
of organic compounds, present in plant extracts of six 
species, and phosphate fertilization on soil phosphorus 
availability. 

Materials and Methods

The experiment was carried out in greenhouse, 
in Botucatu, São Paulo, Brazil, in 2005. The plant 
species used were: black oat (Avena strigosa), 
radish (Raphanus sativus), corn (Zea mays), millet 
(Pennisetum glaucum), soybean (Glycine max), and 
sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), grown for 60 days after 
germination, when the shoot was collected. 

Franchini et al. (2003) reported that the amount 
of nutrients and organic acids in plant tissue changes 
with plant age, and higher concentrations are generally 
found in about 60-day-old plants. Plant shoots, dried in 
a forced-air oven at 65°C for 72 hours, were weighed 
and ground to pass through a 0.1 cm sieve, and then 
analysed for phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium 
(Ca), and magnesium (Mg), using wet acid digestion 
and induced coupled plasma. Nitrogen was analysed 
using sulfuric acid digestion and distillation by micro-
Kjeldahl. Organic carbon (C) was analyzed by Walkley-
Black method, as described in Raij et al. (2001). Water 
pH of the dry matter (1 g dry matter: 10 mL water) was 
also determined. 

Water-extractable LMWOA was determined 
(Franchini et al., 2003) with some modifi cations, as 
described: the extracts were obtained by horizontally 
shaking of 4 g dry matter (DM) with 100 mL distilled 
water, at 220 rev min-1, for one hour; the solution 
was fi ltered using a fi lter paper; 20 mL of the fi ltrate 
were taken in triplicate, acidifi ed with HCl (pH 2.5), 
and successively extracted (three times) with 75 mL 
of ethyl acetate, by hand shaking for one minute. The 
total volume of ethyl acetate (approximately 225 mL) 
was evaporated under low pressure, and then was 
reduced to 0.5–1.0 mL. The remaining solution was 
re-dissolved in H

as mobile phase. The fl ow rate was 0.6 mL min-1, and 

detection was performed at 210 nm. The identifi cation 

and quantifi cation of organic compounds were carried 

out for time retention, and the area of spectra was 

compared to the one of reference standards.

Pots were made of PVC tubes (5 cm diameter and 

30 cm long), with the capacity 0.65 kg of dry soil. The 

soil chosen for this experiment was a Typic Hapludox 

(Soil Survey Staff, 1999), with 222 g kg-1 clay; 

40 g kg-1 silt and 738 g kg-1 sand, with the following 

chemical characteristics (Raij et al., 2001): pH CaCl

, 

5.60; OM, 24.7 g dm-3; resin-P, 4.6 mg dm-3; with 0.7, 

33 and 13.3 mmol
c
 dm-3 K, Ca, and Mg, respectively; 

and 72% base saturation. The soil was homogeneously 

compacted inside the tube, to simulate fi eld conditions. 

A net was fi xed at the tube bottom to prevent soil loss. 

Each pot constituted a plot.

Plant extracts were obtained in a similar way 

for organic acid analysis, by shaking 4 g DM with 

100 mL of distilled water at 220 rev min-1 for one hour. 

Then, the solutions were fi ltered using a fi lter paper. 

The treatments consisted of plant fi ltered extracts 

application, equivalent to 20 Mg ha-1 of dry matter, 

which corresponded to 87 mL of extract in each plot. It 

is important to emphasize that this amount is similar to 

the expected one to be released by harvested and cover 

crops in a two-year crop rotation, but in the present 

work the extracts were applied in a few minutes, in 

order to maximize the possible effects of LMWOA in 

soil. The amount applied was much higher than that 

from residues decomposition, but this amount was 

adopted based on the possibility to rapidly measure the 

effects, and based on literature research about nutrient 

availability under plant residues deposition (Franchini 

et al., 2003; Amaral et al., 2004; Moraes et al., 2007). 

The treatments used were: black oat, millet, corn, 

radish, soybean, sorghum, and distilled water, as 

control, with the chemical characteristics described in 

Table 1. These seven treatments were conducted with 

and without phosphate fertilization using, as P source, 

simple superphosphate (100 kg ha-1 of P) applied in soil 

surface, immediately before plant extracts application, 

totalizing fourteen treatments. Soil columns were 

previously wet and soil humidity was kept close 

to water fi eld capacity, throughout the seven-day 

experiment. Plastic fi lm inside the PVC tube was used 

for a better contact between soil and tube, and to avoid 

preferential water fl ux through the internal surface of 

the column. The 87 mL of the extract applied to each 

plot contained nutrients in the quantities shown in 

Table 1. Temperature inside the greenhouse, during the 

seven-day experiment, was from 22 to 32ºC.

After one hour of plant extracts application, the 

solution that percolated through the soil column was 

collected. The amount percolated was approximately 

80 mL in each column, almost all the extract volume 

added. A similar collect was repeated on the seventh 

day after extract application. By this time, 50 mL of 

distilled water was applied, and approximately 40 mL 

of the percolated solution was collected in each 

column. The solutions were analyzed for P, K, Ca, and 

Mg, by inductive couple plasma. On the seventh day, 

the columns were destroyed and the soil samples were 

taken in the layers of 0–5, 5–10, 10–15 e 15–30 cm. 

Soil samples were oven-dried at 65ºC for 48 hours, 

ground, and sieved (0.2 cm). 

Phosphorus pools in soil were determined in soil 

samples, using P fractionation (Hedley et al., 1982), 

with some modifi cations (Cross &amp;amp; Schlesinger, 1995) as 

follows: sequential extraction by anion-exchange resin, 

0.5 mol L-1 NaHCO

NaOH were determined by digestion with ammonium 
persulfate and sulfuric acid, in autoclave at 120ºC, for 
two hours. And then, the organic P was measured in the 
same way as described in case of inorganic P.

The experimental design was a 7x2 factorial with 
4 replicates. ANOVA was carried out using SAS 8.2 
(SAS Institute, 2001), and means were compared using 
the t test, at 5% probability. 

Results and Discussion

Each plant species had a different nutrient content in 
shoot dry matter (Table 1). Soybean and radish presented 
higher contents of N, P, K, and Ca. Consequently, these 
plant species were able to return a higher amount of 
these nutrients to soil, when their extracts were applied, 
leading to a higher nutrient availability. The maximum 
amount of P applied via plant extract (radish) was 
5.9 mg per soil column. The amounts of K were high 
in all the plant extracts, and the amounts of Ca and Mg 
added via extracts were considered low, compared to 
the original soil contents. 

There was a large variation in organic acid contents 
among species, and some acids were very specifi c to 
each plant species (Figure 1). Radish had the highest 
quantity of malic and oxalic acids, which explain the 
highest quantity of total accumulated LMWOA of 
275 mmol

c
 kg-1 of DM. Soybean presented the lowest 

content of LMWOA, with a total accumulated of 
44 mmol

c
 kg-1, with predominance of succinic acid. In 

all crops, citric, t-aconitic, and acetic acids were found 
predominantly in black oat, millet, corn, and sorghum. 
Accordingly, radish extract could play an important 
role in increasing soil nutrient availability, since this 
crop normally presents high amount of malic acid 
and other LMWOA in plant tissue (Franchini et al., 
2003; Moraes et al., 2007). In a similar study, Amaral 
et al. (2004) observed that citric and malic acids are 
predominat in radish tissue. 

The type and amount of carboxylates from organic 
compounds produced or accumulated by plants are 
responsible for different interactions with soil nutrients, 
promoting adsorption and complexation reactions 
(Jones, 1998; Guppy et al., 2005). Monocarboxylic 
organic acids, such as acetic acid, have a limited effect 
in competing with ions for adsorption sites in soil. 
Conversely, malic and citric acids, which present two 
and three carboxylates, respectively, plus additional 

hydroxyl groups, are stronger competitors for soil 
adsorption sites (Guppy et al., 2005). Otherwise, 
some LMWOA may promote changes in soil physical 
properties, like penetration resistance and water 
disperse clay content, as mentioned by Correa et al. 
(2008), who evaluated the application of citric and 
oxalic acids in soil.

Despite the high amounts of LMWOA applied 
through plant extracts, they were not detected in 
solution percolated through the soil columns, analysed 
by HPLC, possibly due to a rapid interaction with soil 
colloids, retention in soil functional groups (clay and 
oxides), or degradation by microorganisms in soil (van 
Hees et al., 2005; Moraes et al., 2007). Similar results 
were found by Amaral et al. (2004), after the application 
of black oat and radish residues in soil. However, Pires 
et al. (2007) found a reasonable quantity of organic 
acids in the leachates, but only when the rhizosphere 
zone solution was extracted from the soil, which 
revealed the presence of acetic, lactic and oxalic acids 
and trace concentrations of butyric, citric, fumaric, 
gluconic, malic, succinic, and tartaric acids.

The nutrient percolations were very low compared 
with the amounts applied, and there was no effect 
of P fertilization on nutrients percolation from plant 
extracts through the soil columns, in both (0 and 7 days) 
solution samplings (Tables 2 and 3). One hour after 
extract application, P, K, and Ca percolation through 
soil columns seemed to be inhibited by the presence of 
plant extracts, since the leached nutrient content was 
higher in water control than in treatments (Table 2).

Plant extract effect on soil phosphorus availability 1383

Pesq. agropec. bras., Brasília, v.43, n.10, p.1379-1388, out. 2008

Seven days after the application, the amount of 
nutrients percolated through the soil columns showed a 
large variation (Table 3), some plant extracts seemed to 
inhibit, whereas others accelerated nutrient percolation 
in soil. Millet and radish were the most effective 
species in reducing P concentration in the leached 
solution, in both samplings (0 and 7 days), possibly 
due to complexation between organic compounds from 
plant residues and phosphate, in soil profi le (Gahoonia 
et al., 2000).

Although phosphorus was the focus of the 
work, some important cations were also evaluated 
in percolated solution. Potassium, calcium, and 
magnesium concentrations in leached solution were 
considerably increased after seven days, for all plant 
extracts (Table 3), when compared to the solution 
collected one hour after application. This increment 
was attributed to the amount of K, Ca, and Mg applied 
via plant extract (Table 1), which, after seven days, 
were available in soil solution and were susceptible 
to leaching. Otherwise, interactions among organic 
carboxylates and soil cations could favour ion binding 
to soil colloids, which could be a consequence of 
reduced leaching in some plant species.

The extracts of all species led to an increase in resin-
extractable P in the 0–5-cm layer, with radish and 
soybean showing the highest increase (Figure 2 A). 

The amount of P present in radish and soybean extracts 
(Table 1) contributed to a large extent for the increment 
observed in available P in soil, since 5.9 and 4.6 mg of 
P were applied to those columns, respectively. If most 
of this P remain in the surface layer, the increment in 
available P could be signifi cant. Following this idea, 
literature information shows that high amounts of 
malic acid and total LMWOA present in plant extracts 
affect P availability, reacting and promoting complex 
formation between phosphate and organic compounds 
in soil (Gahoonia et al., 2000). 

In general, grass species presented lesser potential 
to make P available than soybean and radish, in surface 
layer 0–5 cm (Figure 2 A). However, in deeper layers, 
there was no effect of plant extracts on P availability. 
When phosphate fertilizer was applied, plant extracts 
presented potential to immobilize P, reducing its 
availability, when compared to control treatment, 
possibly by a complexation between carboxylates 
and phosphate (Figure 2 B) mentioned in literature 
(Gahoonia et al., 2000). This complexation was more 
evident in the 0–5 and 5–10-cm soil layers, highlighted 
when grass extracts were used. 

The inorganic P extracted by bicarbonate 
(0.5 mol L-1 NaHCO

3
) was increased in all soil depths 

with all extracts, but the increase was signifi cant only 
in the 0–5 and 5–10-cm layers (Figure 2 C), similarly

substantially (Figure 2 D). The organic P fraction

Plant extracts increased inorganic P extracted by

higher values in the surface layer 0–5 cm for millet,

tissue. Taking into account all the previous fractions, 
plant extracts seem to be acting as chelating agents, 
maintaining P in forms less available in soil. However, 
this P cannot be considered unavailable over a long 
term, as it can become available as soon as the solution 
P is depleted (Novais &amp;amp; Smyth, 1999; Gahoonia et al., 
2000). When phosphate fertilizer was applied, the 
amount of inorganic P in this fraction was signifi cantly 
increased, in all soil layers (Figure 3 B), which indicates 
that the total P applied via fertilizer does not remain 
only in labile forms in soil, and may also be part of the 
moderately available fraction.

Organic P extracted by 0.1 mol L-1 NaOH allowed 
no conclusive discussion (Figure 3 C and D). Similar 
results for both organic and inorganic P extracted by 
0.1 mol L-1 NaOH were obtained by Gatiboni (2003) 
and Gatiboni et al. (2007), in clayey soils from 
Southern Brazil. Organic compounds present in plant 
extracts reduced the organic available P, extracted by 
bicarbonate, possibly by complexation of phosphate 
or by formation of organo-metallic bonds (Gahoonia 
et al., 2000; Guppy et al., 2005). Other experiments 
showed that P applied as fertilizer or from plant and 
animal manure normally promotes accumulation of P 
in inorganic fractions in soil, with small or no changes 
in organic P availability (Friesen et al., 1997; Gatiboni, 
2003).

The fraction of inorganic P extracted by 1 mol L-1 
HCl was affected by plant extracts in almost all 
soil layers, which promoted higher values than the 
control, with small differences between plant species 
(Figure 3 E). When fertilizer was applied, signifi cant 
increment in P extracted by HCl was observed in 
almost all soil layers, similarly as without fertilizer, 
although the fertilizer promoted increments in this P 
fraction only at 0–5-cm layer (Figure 3 F).

The extraction of inorganic P by 0.5 mol L-1 NaOH 
was similar to those obtained for 0.1 mol L-1 NaOH, 
with higher values in the presence of plant extracts, 
pointing to a possible P immobilization of available 
fractions, as a result of extracts applied, although 
most data were not signifi cant (Figure 4 A and B). 
The organic P fraction presented a wide variation 
among treatments and depths, turning diffi cult any 
clear conclusion (Figure 4 C and D). No effect of 
phosphate fertilizer was observed on P fractions 
extracted by NaOH 0.5 mol L-1, which followed 
the same behaviour observed in data presented by 
Gatiboni et al. (2007).

Residual P fraction remained stable with the 
application of plant extracts and fertilizer (Figure 4 E 
and F). No signifi cant difference was observed 
between plant extracts, although it was possible to 
detect some variations in soil profi le. The residual 
fraction accounted for approximately 60% of total 
P present in soil; similar results were obtained by 
Gatiboni et al. (2007). These authors studied a clayey 
soil in Southern Brazil, and mentioned that although 
the residual amount was high, even this fraction may 
be depleted after successive cultivated crops without 
fertilizer, which shows that residual P can become 
available when a long time frame is considered.

Considering all data from P fractionation, there 
was an increase in labile pool, which could be a 
consequence of the quantity added via plant extract 
or of the interaction between organic compounds and 
soil, being more expressive with soybean and radish 
extracts. However, when inorganic P was applied, 
in the form of fertilizer, plant extracts seemed to 
immobilize P, complexing it with organic compounds 
and retaining it in less available forms (Gahoonia 
et al., 2000). Although the inorganic labile P was 
increased by application of plant extracts, the highest 
increase was observed in inorganic moderately 
labile P. Considering these labile and moderately labile 
fractions together, it seems that plant extracts maked 
P less available immediately after addition to the 
soil but, possibly, it may turn available later, as soil/
solution reactions occur. The increase in moderately 
labile P pool could be considered a positive aspect 
in a long term, because, supposedly, as soon as the 
available pool is depleted, the less available pool can 
become available.

Evaluating all data from Hedley fractionation, it is 
possible to infer that the addition of plant extracts increased 
most of the inorganic soil P fractions, without signifi cant 
changes in organic fractions. However, it is important to 
emphasize that the amount of plant extract applied was 
much higher than what normally occurs in cultivated 
areas. The observed changes were more evident in the 
surface layer 0–5 cm, which may be in part attributed to the 
amount applied via plant extracts. Small changes were also 
observed in deeper layers, such as 5–10 and 10–15 cm.

Many studies have demonstrated the effect of 
LMWOA on the availability of soil nutrient (Franchini 
et al., 2003; Amaral et al., 2004; Moraes et al., 2007). 
However, in most of them, high rates of LMWOA

and high rates of fertilizers were used, which is not 
observed in farms. In the present study, the amount of 
plant extracts applied were equivalent to a two-year 
crop rotation (about 20 Mg ha-1 of DM), but the 
extracts were applied in a short time in soil columns. 

This fact makes the extrapolation to fi eld conditions 
diffi cult, since in these conditions soil reaction and 
microbial activity are slower, and the results would 
possibly be different from the obtained in greenhouse 
pots.

Conclusions

1. Plant extracts lead to an accumulation of inorganic 
phosphorus in labile and moderately labile fractions, 
mainly in the soil surface layer 0–5 cm. 

2. Among the plant species used, radish and soybean 
are the most effi cient in increasing available phosphorus 
fractions in soil. 

3. The labile and moderately labile inorganic 
phosphorus fractions are increased by phosphate 
fertilization down to 10–15-cm soil layer.
