ABSTRACT	
  
	
  
	
  

	
  
Africa has recently become a region of strategic importance for both the U.S. and 

China, which has resulted in what some have called The third scramble for Africa. Both 

countries are actively competing for Africa's natural resources, for markets and for 

political influence, using several strategies and tactics to ensure and expand their 

interests. This dissertation aims to analyse the main actions and reactions taken by the 

U.S. in Africa, regarding China's presence on the continent. It examines the two 

countries cooperation policy and their interests in Africa as well as the measures that 

have been taken by the U.S. to strengthen its strategic policy in Africa. It concludes that, 

even though the U.S. is using diplomatic, military and economic instruments to counter 

China's influence on the continent, it doesn't intend to attack China directly. Instead, the 

U.S. is employing a "smart power" policy characterized by cautiousness.

RESUMO 
 

 

A África tornou-se mais recentemente uma região de grande importância estratégica 

para os EUA e a China, resultando, na visão de alguns autores, numa nova corrida pela 

África. Ambos os países estão activamente a competir por recursos naturais, por 

mercados económicos e por influência política, no continente Africano, utilizando 

várias estratégias para assegurar e expandir os seus interesses. A presente dissertação 

tem como principal objectivo apresentar as principais acções e reacções desenvolvidas 

pelos EUA no continente africano, assumindo a presença cada vez mais forte da China 

em África. A dissertação analisa a política de cooperação dos dois países e os seus 

interesses no continente, bem como as medidas tomadas pelos EUA para reforçar a sua 

política estratégica no continente, como resposta  às acções desenvolvidas pela China. A 

partir da analise realizada pode-se concluir que, apesar dos EUA utilizarem vários 

instrumentos diplomáticos, militares e económicos para conter a influência da China no 

continente, a intenção de Washington não é atacar a China directamente. Em vez disso, 

os EUA estão a empregar uma política de "smart power" caracterizada essencialmente 

pela cautela e prudência.

INTRODUCTION	
  

	
  

Over the last decade, Africa has become a strategic region for new emerging 

powers, such as China, Brazil, India, Russia, for the European countries that once 

dominated the continent and also for the U.S.  Not since the end of the Cold War has the 

U.S. been so actively involved in a scramble over political, economic and geostrategic 

interests on the distant continent. What’s more, the opponent, as with the ex-USSR, is 

another communist state: China. 

The key reason for Africa’s growing importance on the international scene is quite 

obvious: Africa is home to some of the largest deposits of natural resources in the 

world, from rare metals, rare earth, non-ferrous and ferrous metals, to fossil fuel such as 

oil and gas.1 Its impressive natural heritage has been the main reason for what some 

have called The Third Scramble for Africa - “competition for control of strategic 

resources” (YI-CHONG, 2008.p16) - with China, the U.S. and the European countries 

actively competing against each other for Africa’s natural resources, for markets and for 

political influence. 

The increasing presence of China in Africa has drawn a lot of controversy and strong 

criticism among some Western countries2, which perceive Chinese foreign policy for 

Africa as a growing threat to their own interests. It is increasingly evident that Chinese 

economic involvement in several African countries has forced the traditional African 

partners, particularly Europe and the U.S., to reassess its strategic political cooperation 

with the continent.	
  Therefore, taking into account China's influence on the continent, in 

recent years the U.S. has shown a growing interest in Africa in order to ensure access to 

energy resources, gain a geostrategic position and political influence in African 

countries, using several strategies and tactics to achieve its objectives. 	
  

This dissertation seeks to provide a basis for reflection and discussion regarding the 

main actions and reactions taken by the U.S. in Africa, regarding China's presence on 

the continent. More significantly, it aims to answer the following question: Has Chinese

presence in Africa prompted an increase in American involvement on the continent, and 

if so, in what way?  

Besides this, there are a set of other objectives to support this overall aim: (i) to 

understand the U.S. and China cooperation policy and their interests in Africa, (ii) to 

analyse how the "soft power" policy employed by China undermines the U.S. strategic 

plans in Africa; (iii) to examine what measures have been taken to strengthen the U.S. 

strategic policy in Africa as a response to China’s presence in Africa and comprehend if 

there is an action - reaction effect. These objectives will help to test the central 

hypothesis: China is one of the main reasons that led the U.S. to engage with key 

African countries over securing its strategic interests, controlling China’s growing 

international stature on the continent.	
  

In terms of methodology, this study will follow the deductive approach based on the 

observation of empirical reality, taking into account a variety of disciplines such as 

History, Geopolitics, Political Science, International Relations and Economics.  

The dissertation is divided into four chapters: the paper begins by exploring the 

theoretical basis for the research topic presented here, based on the theory of IR. The 

second chapter examines the U.S.’s foreign policy towards Africa and its interests on 

the continent. Chapter three describes the Chinese foreign policy and geo-economic 

strategy for the continent, exploring at the same time its interests in Africa. Chapter four 

addresses the implications of China's initiatives for the U.S. foreign policy in Africa. 

The chapter will also discuss various U.S. political, economic and military/security 

reactions to China's presence in Africa. Finally, the dissertation presents the main 

conclusions arising from the work and suggests some topics for future research. 

It should also be noted that the research topic presented here, which has raised a number 

of political, economic, and geostrategic questions among academics, politicians, 

analysts and observers, is also an important issue for the international balance of power 

whose implications are still far from known. 	
  

Furthermore, it’s important to acknowledge that the dissertation is not exempt from 

imperfections and criticism, nor can it be seen as complete.

CHAPTER	
  I	
  	
  

THEORETICAL	
  FRAMEWORK	
  

By analysing the main paradigms of international relations (IR) theory, this chapter 

attempts to provide a relevant framework about the political relations between states and 

their behaviour in international context. 	
  

Since the beginning of International Relations, which is often thought to be marked by 

the Treaty of Westphalia3, many scholars have tried to develop a wide variety of 

theories that could contribute to a better understanding of the international environment.  

Taking into account the great variety of theoretical perspectives, the existence of five 

major conceptions of IR it is often accepted: realism; idealism/ liberalism; society of 

states; pluralist – interdependent and neo-Marxism. There are, however, other authors 

who consider other main paradigms.4  

The idealism approach of IR, that dominated the period between the two World Wars, 

underlies the belief that IR should be governed by certain ethical principles to achieve 

peace and harmony between independent entities. The idealists share a common interest 

for peace and for an international balance of power. They believe that international 

behaviour can be ordered through the use of rational mechanisms and legal institutions. 

Furthermore, idealists hold that cooperation is the central feature of international 

activity, which can control the warring passions of the states. The revival of 

idealism/liberalism thinking about international politics was accelerated by the 

development of neo-liberalism in the 80’s. Neo-liberalism seeks to understand the 

behaviour of states through the institutions. Keohane believes that "the behaviour of 

states is highly conditioned (but not determined) by the institutions" (KEOHANE, 1989, 

p.2). 5  The International Institutions are seen as purely utilitarian, being able to reduce 

the hostile international environment and allowing states to pursue common interests. 

Regarding states’ interests, some authors like Joseph Nye, argue that in order to achieve 

their goals, states should use “soft power” 6 - the ability of a country to persuade others 

	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
   	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  
3 According to the international relations theorists the Treaty of Westphalia established the system of 
sovereign states with equal rights and protection from the intrusion of other states. 
4 See for instance EVANS and NEWHAM,(1998); JACKSON and SORENSEN,(2007). Due to the space 
limitation I decided to focus only on the realism and liberalism approach.

Relations Theory, Boulder, Co., Westview Press in CRAVINHO, (2006, p. 223)

American Power (1990).

to do what it wants without force or coercion and without having to use “hard power” 

based on “military intervention, coercive diplomacy, and economic sanctions” (NYE, 

1990, p. 166). In Nye’s opinion, sometimes a nation can achieve its goals only “by 

employing the attractiveness of nation’s foreign policy, values and culture” (NYE, 

2004). He also argues that because the results of “soft power” are more diffuse and 

harder to achieve, states could also use a combination of hard and soft power – a 

synergy that leads to “smart power”. “Power in the global information age” Nye asserts 

“will include a soft dimension of attraction as well as the hard combinations of 

coercion and inducement” (NYE, 2008, p. 107).  

On the other hand, the realist theory of IR, introduced mainly by Carr7 and 

Morgenthau8, arises in contrast to the idealist school of thought, which, according to the 

realists, failed to understand the international system leading to the Second World War. 

The main premise of realism is that there are fixed rules, which regulate individual and 

state behaviour: states, like man, are by nature self-interested and aggressive and will 

pursue their interests to the detriment of others. Inspired by Machiavelli (16th century), 

but essentially by Hobbes (17th century)9, realism’s point of departure is that the 

structure of the international system explains the behaviour of states and the aspects of 

IR. According to both classical and contemporary realists, the absence of a central 

authority is the essential feature of the contemporary international system. The idea of 

international anarchy10, is based on Thomas Hobbes concept of state of nature, 

according to which the “life” between all men is a permanent war of “all against all”, 

since states will use all their political power to promote their interests and there’s no one 

else that they can depend on but themselves. Furthermore, since states naturally seek to 

maximize their power in order to intimidate the weaker states, the level of mutual 

suspicion is constantly high.11 	
  

The aggressive intent of states combined with the lack of world government, means that 

conflict is an unavoidable and ever-present reality of IR, meaning that we live in - what 

Aron called - “the shadow of war” (ARON, 2002, p. 54). Classical realists generally

9 It is also important to mention the Greek historian Thucydides, who was one of earliest scholars to 
reflect on the conflict dimension of IR, especially on Peloponnesian Wars between Sparta and Athens 
(431-404. BC).  
10 Anarchy is seen as formal and it should be understood as order, stability and as a form of regulating the 
interactions among independent units.  
11 See also (HOBBES, 1949)

assume that states12 are the central players in the international system, which has its 

roots in “human natures”. According to Morgenthau“political realism believes that 

politics, like society in general, is governed by objective laws that have their roots in 

human nature”.13 The interaction between the “egoistic passions” and international 

anarchy marks the concept of “power” as the theoretical core of IR. Thus, international 

politics is a game consisting of the use of power and the demand of power (“power” 

being the instrument and the goal of participation in the international system). The 

assumption behind this premise is that the accumulation of “power” is the states’ 

foremost foreign policy objective. In addition, Morgenthau believes that states have 

irreconcilable interests and each seeks to promote its interests in the most convenient 

way.14 	
  

Classical realism has been the dominant model of IR during the past six decades. 

Nevertheless, the classical version has received a lot of critical scrutiny. One of the most 

important approaches that redesigned the view of classical realism was neo-realism 

thought. Neo-realism shares many core assumptions of classical realism; however its 

defenders argue that it is the nature of the anarchic structure that explains the units’ 

behavior. That is, the neo-realists believe that only a systemic theory can explain the 

nature of international context (WALTZ, 2002). 

The beginning of neo-realism was marked by Kenneth Waltz’s book A Theory of 

International Politics (1979). Neo-realism seeks to identify the structure of international 

anarchy in order to create explanatory theories of international behavior, considering 

many system-level theories as reductionists. In contrast to classical realism, neo-realists 

dismiss the role of human nature, focusing instead on a “top-down” approach where the 

“structure” of the international system plays the leading role in the relationships 

between states rather than the nature of the individual (DONNELLY, 2004, p. 24).  

According to Waltz, the contemporary system is anarchic and decentralized rather than 

hierarchical. Order is not imposed by a supreme authority “but arises from the 

interactions of formally equal political actor” (DONNELLY, 2004, p. 17). 

Furthermore, in anarchic environments in Waltz’s view “each unit’s incentive is to put 

itself in a position to be able to take care of itself since no one else can be counted on to 

	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
   	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  
12 Note that states are seen as the dominant and unitary units because they act uniformly in the 
international system, and rational because they pursue to protect their national interests.  
13 (MORGENTHAU and THOMPSON, 1985, p. 4) See also (NIEBUHR, 1932). 
14 See also (CARR, 1981), (NIEBUHR, 1932, pp. 56-76)

do so”. 15 The main difference between states is “of capabilities, not function”. Waltz 

argues that states differ not so much in what they seek to achieve, but in their 

capabilities to achieve goals that are largely shared. Moreover, in an anarchic order, the 

most important thing is how the states’ capabilities are distributed among themselves, 

and how much power a particular state has in relation to others. The desire of each state 

to maximize relative power16 constrains each other, resulting in a “balance of power”. 

This situation gives rise to the “security dilemma” 17 which all nations face.   

Furthermore, for neo-realists although material power matters, it is not an end to itself, 

but an instrument. As Zakaria notes, states seek to maximize influence, not power, or to 

put it differently “states seek to maximize opportunities for implementing their 

preferences”.18 That is why states should seek to distribute the power between allies to 

ensure its leadership for longer. Regarding the balance of power, defensive realists 

agree that states have every interest in maintaining the existing balance of power that 

provides stability with survival being the main motive of states. Thus, the state’s foreign 

policy should be characterized by “cautiousness, alliance building, and interest-based 

interaction with other states” (KHALID, 2007, p. 46)  

On the other hand, offensive realists argue that states are not often satisfied with the 

simple balance of power. According to Mearsheimer, “a state's ultimate goal is to be 

the hegemon in the system".19 Since global hegemony is “almost impossible”, a great 

power has two goals: to dominate its region and prevent other powers from dominating 

other regions. 20 

Concluding, both classical and contemporary realism are adequate tools to help us 

understand the state’s behaviour and motivations. Although often considered too 

simplistic and pessimistic, the realism approach provides us a guide on how states 

actually try to survive in a world whose nature is unlikely to change. It is worth noting 

that this framework will serve as a background for the analysis I intend to pursue.

  POLICY	
  TOWARDS	
  AFRICA:	
  FROM	
  
BACKWATER	
  TO	
  STRATEGIC	
  IMPORTANCE	
  

  

Taking into consideration the power relations between the States there is a clear 

difference of how China and the U.S. are engaging with Africa. The foreign policies 

adopted by each country fit within a large context of national interests, and the way 

these policies are implemented generate different results for each country.   

1. THE	
  U.S.	
  FOREIGN	
  POLICY	
  TOWARDS	
  AFRICA	
  

The end of the Cold War marked a major challenge for American policy towards Africa. 

The difficulty in defining a set of national interests in the region which could make a 

more proactive foreign policy, made Africa to be seen as a national interest backwater, 

not deserving the attention from the top decision makers -“Africa was never really a big 

part of the strategic plan”.21 As Chris Alden notes, traditionally US-Africa relations 

have been “characterized in the main by indifference and neglect, punctuated by 

flurries of interest and action” (ALDEN C. , 2000, p. 355).  

After the Second World War, U.S. African policy was determined by a continuous 

effort to impose American values of democracy and human rights, constituting the base 

of the U.S. “rhetorical Commitments to Africa”. However, the manner in which these 

objectives were pursued generally remained shaped by U.S. geo-strategic interests – 

“containing the Soviet/Communism expansionism on the continent and building 

ideological affiliations with African countries” (SIMEON, 2010, p. 58).  

It wasn’t until the second term of the Clinton Administration (1997-2001) that Africa 

started to gain a new significance, “even if was still seen through the lens of ad hoc 

humanitarianism, rather than in a strategic manner” (LYMAN, 2006).22 The increasing 

emphasis on economic links to Africa and its integration into global economy, have 

been the main principles of Clinton’s foreign policy towards Africa. In order to

encourage trade and investment, the Clinton administration adopted a trade bill, The 

African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) (2000), designed to liberalise the trade 

between the U.S. and eligible African countries. 23 Besides this, high priority was given 

to security issues and to the promotion of democratic enlargement.24 In spite of the 

continuing efforts of President Clinton to create a more effective African policy, the 

truth is that it was never defined in the context of a long-term strategy. 

 Over the course of the Bush administration (2001-2009), Africa was perceived as being 

“a scar” on the conscience of the world. Thus, because of moral imperative obligation of 

the U.S., the grants for humanitarian intervention associated with poverty reduction and 

aid driving, rather than investment, have substantially increased.25 Nevertheless, the 

events of 9/11 led the Bush administration to engage with Africa from a “war on terror” 

perspective, increasing the foreign aid and its military presence in various regions, 

especially in the Sahel and East Africa. However, despite the adoption of a large 

number of new development programs26 African policy under the Bush administration 

continued with the failures of previous administrations. The absence of a careful 

strategic vision and lack of coordination between the different agencies prevented the 

establishment of a coherent and articulated policy in the African countries (WALLE, 

2009, p. 11). Only by the end of his second term (2004-2009) and due to the potential 

growing importance of African oil, did Africa become a new strategic importance for 

U.S. interests. Coincidently, it was then that the U.S. seemed to finally understand the 

growing magnitude of Chinese influence in Africa.  

The mandate of President Obama brought high expectation, even if unrealistic. Early in 

his term, Obama indicated that he planned to develop a set of more comprehensive and 

effective policies towards Africa attempting to mix the economic and security interests 

in the region with some adjustments to the development agenda. On his visit to Ghana 

in 2009, Obama highlighted the importance of good governance arguing

that“Development depends upon good governance.[…]And that is a responsibility that 

can only be met by Africans". 27 The visit of the Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton 

(2009), on the other hand, was directed to more specific economic issues. As Johnnie 

Carson puts it“In this time of economic crisis, it is important that the United States and 

Africa work cooperatively as a major trading partners” (cited in ORI, 2009) 

While U.S. African policy under the Obama administration seems to be more engaging, 

it is also clear that it has stayed consistent with the long-term trend and interests. 

Numerous programs from the Bush administration have been kept in place, such as 

Africa Command (AFRICOM), and key allies on the continent have not changed much 

(WHITE, 2010, p. 27). In reality Obama's strategy in Africa is a solidification of 

existing policy rather than a statement of new policy. 28 Nevertheless, today more than 

ever Africa is becoming a priority region for U.S. interests.

  U.S.	
  INTERESTS	
  TOWARDS	
  AFRICA	
  

The U.S. interests in Africa can be classified into three main groups: (i) economic 

interests; (ii) geopolitical interests; (iii) geostrategic and security interests.  

  2.1. Economic Interests  

There is no doubt that natural resources, especially oil, are the key motives that brought 

together the U.S. and China in getting involved in Africa. As Walter Kansteiner, the 

assistant secretary of State for Africa noted, “African oil is of national strategic interest 

to us”.29 This growing importance of oil was highlighted as top priority for the U.S. due 

to some factors that should be mentioned: “(i) the rising domestic energy demand, (ii) 

new discoveries and production of oil in Africa, (iii) and new players moving into the 

continent” (YI-CHONG, 2008, p. 19); (iv) the growing instability from traditional 

American suppliers, such as Middle East. Currently more than 20% of the U.S.’ 

imported oil has its origins in Africa.30 New oil and gas discoveries, especially in West 

African countries, such as Nigeria, and Angola, have made the continent more attractive 

to the U.S.31 In addition to oil and gas interests, there are many other natural resources

of extremely high importance to the U.S. economy, such as raw gems, and precious 

metals and minerals. Besides this, the U.S. is also seeking to expand its trade and 

investments in Africa and this is illustrated, in part by the expansion of total U.S. trade 

(imports plus exports) with sub-Saharan-Africa (SSA). Since 2000 U.S.-Africa trade has 

increased 221% growing from $29.4 billion in 2000 to over $94 billion in 2011.32 In the 

year 2000, trade with Africa made up 1,5 % of total U.S. global trade, and Africa’s 

share had grown to 2,6% by 2011 (JONES and WILLIAMS, 2012, p. 8) However, 

unlike China, which is engaging with Africa by using economic instruments, the U.S. is 

less involved in promoting strong business ties in Africa. In fact, Foreign Direct 

Investment (FDI) has been largely stagnant. SSA countries are relatively minor 

destination of U.S. FDI. Africa, as a whole hosts about 1% of total U.S. FDI33 being 

largely concentrated in mining and extractive industries, which together comprise some 

$29 billion of the $54 billion total stock of U.S. FDI in Africa.34   

2.2. Geopolitical Interests  

Beyond the economic interests, the U.S. is increasingly seeking political and diplomatic 

support of African countries in the UN and WTO willing at the same time to counter 

attempts by others to do so. However due to the lack of a comprehensive diplomatic 

representation in Africa states,35 the U.S. has had difficulty in getting political support 

from African governments. The emergence of a proactive Chinese policy in the region, 

the disastrous effects of the Iraq war, and the Bush administration’s rhetorical 

commitment to unilateralism, weakened the U.S.’ reputation in the region (WALLE, 

2009, p. 14). Many countries prefer China as a partner, since it does not interfere in the 

affairs of other countries. There is also some evidence that by increasing their presence 

on the African continent, the U.S. is trying to reduce China’s growing international 

influence, since the U.S. acknowledges China as having the capability to threaten its 

global dominance and unipolarity (SIMEON, 2010, p. 63).36

35According to Walle the U.S. diplomatic presence in Africa has declined due to the ”worsening 
institutional fragmentation in the foreign policy apparatus, contradictions in policy and the decline in the 
state Department’s institutional capacity” (WALLE, 2009, p.3) 
36 China’s rise has led to” China’s threat theory” according to which it is inconceivable to China to have a 
peaceful rise and will inevitably be a threat to the U.S.

2.3. Geostrategic and security interests  

A number of security issues, especially counterterrorism, became priority in the list of 

U.S. interests in Africa. After the bombing of U.S. embassies in Nairobi (Kenya) and 

Dar es Salam (Tanzania) in 1998 and the attacks of 9/11 the United States realized that 

Africa posed a serious security threat.37 The “war on terrorism”, based on the idea that 

weak states can bring instability to Africa nations and the fear that al-Qaeda-type 

organizations could become established in African failed states, has been Washington’s 

rhetoric to justify its growing military presence in Africa. The National Security 

Strategy of 2002 is an example of these terrorist concerns: “In Africa promise and 

opportunity sit side by side with disease, war and desperate poverty. This threatens both 

a core value of the United States – preserving human dignity – and our strategic 

priority – combating global terror” (THE WHITE HOUSE, 2002). Under these 

circumstances the U.S. considers to have the moral obligation to ensure stability in 

Africa, leading it to install military programs in several countries. In 2007, in an attempt 

to find an appropriate response in fighting terrorism, the Bush administration announced 

the creation of AFRICOM38 aimed to protect and defend the national security interests 

of the United States by strengthening the defense capabilities of African states in order 

to deter and defeat transnational threats and to provide a security environment 

conducive to good governance and development.39 More recently, the deployment of 

approximately 100 American military personnel to Uganda, to advise military units in 

capturing or killing the Lord’s Resistance Army leader, Joseph Kony, can’t hide the 

purpose of containing the spread of terrorism in that region. A key question, for some, is 

whether the response to fight this small radical organization has an ulterior motive to 

achieve strategic interests, since this is a region that is becoming a new oil producing 

spot.  

According to some authors, such as Michael Klare and Daniel Volman, the 

establishment of U.S. military bases in strategic African regions also seeks to help to 

ensure the access to natural resources and “fight indigenous forces that might threaten

the free flow of oil exports and other minerals” (KLARE and VOLMAN, 2006, p. 303). 

Additionally, many American and African observers believe that this new political 

enhancement is the beginning of a longer U.S. military presence in Africa, in order to 

indirectly ensure free access to strategic resources; to observe China’s rise closely on 

the continent; and to create a secure environment for oil companies.40 I will return on 

this topic in the next sections.

1. CHINA’S	
  FOREIGN	
  POLICY	
  TOWARDS	
  AFRICA	
  

Unlike the U.S., which presents a short-term strategy for Africa, China’s 

engagement with Africa has evolved and expanded significantly over the last five 

decades. It was after the Second World War that China started to develop a strong 

political engagement with African countries, providing ambiguous support to the 

independence and liberation movements, in order to affirm itself as the leader of the 

Non-Aligned Movement41 and hoping to strengthen international alliances against the 

capitalist West and the revisionist communist Soviet Union.42 Throughout the 1960’s 

and 1970’s China provided financial aid, technological assistance, medical support and 

scholarships to the African countries.43 However, the aid program was different from 

western approaches, by being based on bilateral and South–South cooperation (POWER 

and MOHAN, 2008, p. 10). 

After a period of relative neglect during the 80’s and 90’s, the turning point was the 

beginning of the century. The year 2000 witnessed an upgrade in Sino-African relations, 

especially with the institutionalization of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation 

(FOCAC). This forum, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence44, has been 

an effective instrument of soft power to establish a fair and mutually beneficial 

cooperation and a mechanism through which China is coordinating its activities in 

Africa. The various summits held every three years45 are expected to promote political 

	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
   	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  
41 Created in 1961, the Non-Aligned Movement includes 120 countries which advocate a struggle against 
imperialism, neo-colonialism, and all forms of foreign aggression and pursue to protect the sovereignty 
and territorial integrity.

(2006, p. 1) 
43 For instance, China’s aid program in Guinea (1960 -1969). Also a total of $120 million in aid was 
committed to Congo-Brazzaville, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Tanzania between 1963-1964. Other projects can 
be mentioned such as: the rail-way that connects Lusaka and Dar es Salaam, the construction of the 
stadium "Friendship" in Benin, Zambia - Tanzania rail-way.

Ethiopia, in 2003. The 2006 FOCAC Summit was held in Beijing. In 2009 the Summit was held in Sharm 
El Sheik in Egypt and in 2012 in Beijing. See figure No.9

dialogue and economic co-operation, with the long-term aim of common economic 

development and prosperity.46 Thus, the Sino-African relations, defined by the President 

Zeming are based on the principles of: ‘‘sincere friendship, equality, solidarity and 

cooperation, common development and being oriented to the future’’.47  

It is also worth noting the great emphasis that China has given to the historical context 

and to the evocation of political solidarity in its relationship with Africa, which are 

carefully employed to suggest a shared sense of identity as fellow third world states and 

also to present the “Chinese model” of development as a successful one (ALDEN and 

ALVES, 2008).48 The Chinese model, known also as "Beijing Consensus", tends to 

serve as an example for many countries seeking development and maintaining their self-

determination. China’s aid and economic cooperation differ, from the Traditional 

Western models, both in their content and in the norms of aid practice. China’s policy 

towards Africa is premised on respect for sovereignty and “non-interference” in national 

affairs, which differentiates it from western approaches that inevitably come with 

conditions (POWER and MOHAN, 2008, p. 17). Thus, its development assistance and 

economic support are apparently unconditional and does not require the respect for 

western values of good governance or human rights like the Washington Consensus 

does. 49  

Furthermore, authors like Chris Patten argue that while the western approach is based 

on an idealistic view of good intentions, the Chinese paradigm is much more objective, 

pragmatic, flexible and effective (PATTEN, 2009). While the West determines what 

Africa needs, adopting general plans with little adjustment to demand, Chinese strategy 

is based on research providing what local people need, and adopting plans to local 

conditions, which “gives it a great deal of credibility as a partner with relevant recent 

experience”. (BRAUTIGAM, 2009, p. 11)

49 Washington Consensus policies are usually seen as a shift from state-led dirigisme to market oriented 
policies, whose principles are based on the structural change of the entire society, requiring good 
governance, the respect for the human rights, a transparent economy based on free market, etc.

2. CHINA’S	
  INTERESTS	
  IN	
  AFRICA	
  

From a materialistic point of view, the discourse of mutual interdependence reveals 

at the same time the economic and commercial nature of China’s foreign policy towards 

Africa. This relates to the idea that Africa’s resources are important to China’s growth 

and that the engagement with Africa is a win-win situation for both parties (ANSHAN, 

2006).50 

This renewed attention towards Africa was driven by a set of strategic interests. Firstly, 

like the U.S., China needs to ensure the access to energy resources, minerals and 

agricultural products, which are essential for its economic growth. After the U.S., China 

is the second largest oil consumer in the world and the importance of Africa as a top oil 

supplier for China has grown exponentially, as shown by figures No.10 and No.11, with 

Angola being at the moment, the main supplier of China’s oil imports.  

Secondly, China seeks to expand its economic relations with Africa. The favorable 

conditions with access to the African markets, and in some cases the weaknesses of 

some African states is extremely attractive for China’s economic expansion. China’s 

economic engagement with African countries combines three main elements: aid, trade 

and investment. Chinese aid, which consists of grants, zero-interests loans, debt relief 

and concessional loans, is mostly perceived as development projects to produce quick 

and tangible results, which enable China to gain political influence in African 

countries.51  

Nevertheless, it is the trade transactions between China and Africa that provide the most 

powerful evidence of China’s emerging economic interests on the continent. Chinese-

African trade has grown rapidly since 2000, reaching $160 billion in 2011 from just $9 

billion in 2000, surpassing the U.S.52 China’s share in Africa’s total trade has also been 

extraordinary, increasing to 13% from 3% a decade ago (JONES and WILLIAMS, 

2012). Moreover, China’s FDI stock in Africa in 2010 reached more than $13 billion.53 

China is also Africa’s largest single source of imports, while the U.S. is its largest

export destination.54 This economic trend in China’s relationship with Africa is built 

upon its need for natural resources. The evidence of this is that fossil fuels and raw 

materials represent roughly 4/5 of Chinese imports originating from Africa and there are 

around ten African countries which account for 76% of all trade relations with China.55 

Moreover, the financial support from Chinese banks, including China Export-Import 

Bank has had a vital role in strengthening its economic relations with Africa. It provides 

loans to governments and supports Chinese companies, which are normally state-

owned, to invest in Africa through export credits, loans for overseas projects and 

international guarantees.56 Furthermore, in order to take full advantage of the Sino-

African cooperation, China has also established commercial and investment hubs called 

Special Economic Zones (SEZ), "which provide “infrastructure corridors” that link 

African producers and markets in China" (SHINN and EISENMAN, 2008, p. 5). Its 

low interest loans and its funding mechanism of exchange, known as the Angola 

Mode,57 have received strong criticisms among American officials, who argue that by 

pursuing this policy China allows countries to escape IMF and World Bank58 

regulations and also restricts the access of U.S. companies in Africa. 

Thirdly, China seeks to become a major international player promoting a multi-polar 

world, in contrast to the American “bipolar system” (XU YI-CHONG, 2008), and at the 

same time wants to develop good relationships with all African countries to gain 

political support in regional and international forums. And lastly, China is seeking to 

end Taiwan’s international recognition and replacing it with the recognition of Beijing. 

Generally speaking, Chinese interests in Africa are both economic and political 

interests.  

Concluding, over the past decade while the U.S. has all too often ignored SSA in its 

policies, Beijing has quietly established relationships with the continent’s political and 

business elites. The pursuit of its national and international interests instigate a more 

active and globally orientated foreign policy based on its historical traditions with

57 This is an exclusive economic funding mechanism in Sino-African cooperation: the payment of the 
loan for infrastructure projects is made in terms of natural resources. 
58 For instance, in 2006, Angola refused the funds of the IMF, in part thanks to the high development 
assistance and investment that China has injected, or the situation of Sudan, which has rejected Western 
threats and sanctions with respect to the strong violation of human rights.

U.S.	
  RESPONSES	
  TO	
  CHINA’S	
  PRESENCE	
  IN	
  AFRICA	
  

After a brief review of the U.S. and China's foreign policy and interests in Africa, 

this chapter will analyze: (i) the implications of Chinese initiatives to U.S. foreign 

policy in Africa and; (ii) the various American responses to China's presence on the 

continent. The analysis of these parameters will be based on three main dimensions: 

economic, security and political. So far, it seems that the United States doesn’t have an 

effective strategy to counter China’s influence in Africa. What can be seen is rather an 

assembled set of measures aimed to limit China’s dominance. Moreover, U.S.-China 

interaction on the continent can be viewed as an action-reaction sequence.60  

1.	
  ECONOMIC	
  DIMENSION	
  	
  

The Chinese initiatives and economic successes discussed in the previous chapter 

have been followed closely by the U.S. In 2000, the same year that China established 

the FOCAC, the Clinton Administration introduced a comprehensive U.S. trade and 

investment policy for the African continent - the African Growth and Opportunity Act 

(AGOA). Since then, AGOA has been the main economic act to strengthen the U.S.-

Africa relationship, and the only successful economic response to China in Africa and it 

also has had a predominant role in acquiring oil and natural resources. In fact, energy 

resources have dominated the products imported from Africa under AGOA. Since 2000 

exports under AGOA have increased from $8.15 billion in 2001 to $53 billion in 

201161, 90% of which have been energy related products.62 Also, during the first term of 

the Bush Administration (2001-2004), the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) 

(2004), a multi-billion dollar program which provides assistance for “compact 

agreements” to reduce poverty and stimulate the economic growth, was established.63  

	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
   	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  
60I want to use this term, used mainly in physics, to better illustrate the American-Sino interaction on 
African continent. Based on Newton's Third Law of physics: "Every Action has an equal and opposite 
reaction". There is a great similarity between Newtonian force and diplomatic action. As in physics, every 
action in bilateral and multilateral relations (for instance: China’s relation with African countries) can 
produce a response from the political elite of another country which is pursuing similar interests (in this 
case the U.S.) which is pursuing similar interests.

The Obama Administration has also been involved in promoting a more proactive U.S 

economic response to China in Africa. Like his predecessors G.W.Bush and Bill 

Clinton, Obama has embraced AGOA to demonstrate that the U.S. commitment is more 

than just foreign aid, military ties, and special bilateral deals. It is a partnership in 

building the capacity for transformational change. On his official visits to Africa in 

2009, Obama has clearly expressed his wish to help African states to develop 

economically and treat them as potential valuable international partners. Furthermore, 

Hillary Clinton also visited Africa in 2011, voicing U.S. desire for sustainable 

investments in Africa: “We want a relationship of partnership not patronage, of 

sustainability, not quick fixes. We want to establish strong foundation to attract new 

investment” (SECRETARY OF STATE, 2011). 

It is important to note, the official visits have been a mechanism used by the U.S. 

leaders to contribute to a greater U.S. engagement in Africa. However, the number of 

U.S. official visits to Africa in contrast with the Chinese has been highly inferior, 

showing once again how different methods drive different foreign policies.64 	
  

Although AGOA has contributed to increase US-Africa trade, “the achievements of 

AGOA have by and large been below expectations” (BROOKINGS, 2011, p. 3). In 

particular, it has not contributed to any visible economic transformation of African 

economies and has not been able to stimulate American investments in Africa.65 

More recently, in an attempt to encourage the U.S. and Africa to do business together, 

the White House has announced a new U.S. Strategy for Sub-Saharan Africa.66 In an 

attempt to spread the pillars of this new strategy, on July 31st 2012, the Secretary of 

State Hillary Clinton embarked on an official journey to several African countries. 

Apart from strengthening the U.S.–Africa commercial relations, Clinton’s visit has also 

been interpreted as an attempt to counter China’s influence in Africa. According to 

Viano, “The U.S. wants to use this visit as a manoeuvre to limit the influence of China 

[…] cautioning African leaders not to strike deals too easily with China” (VIANO, 

2012).67 This strategy comes only a few weeks after the Forum on China-Africa 

Cooperation (FOCAC) in Beijing. However, coming a bit too late in the game, only six

months left in his term, Obama’s strategy is rather a solidification of existing policy 

than a new policy, and it doesn’t really establish new economic initiatives and major 

innovations in US-Africa trade relations. 

It’s evident that the visits, speeches and meetings haven’t resulted in delivering major 

economic agreements and diplomatic initiatives, apart from small programs, grants and 

loans. The institutional fragmentation and the lack of coordination between many 

American agencies deeply contrasts with the Chinese way of acting, making it difficult 

for the U.S. to achieve concrete economic objectives, especially as China gives African 

countries an alternative way of doing business and more bargaining power.

Apart from economic responses, the U.S. has also been using military initiatives 

and tactics, aimed mainly at combating terrorism and containing local threats to try to 

secure the safe flow of natural resources from Africa. The U.S. has used a variety of 

security assistance programs and established military bases in Africa to enhance its 

military influence68. As a result, the U.S. is now involved directly and indirectly in 

military and surveillance operations against an expanding list of regional enemies. They 

include: al-Qaeda in the Maghreb in North Africa; the Islamist movement Boko Haram 

in Nigeria; possible al-Qaeda-linked militants in post-Qaddafi Libya; Mali’s Islamist 

rebels of the Ansar Dine, al-Shabaab in Somalia; Joseph Kony Lord’s Resistance Army 

(LRA) in the Central African Republic and Uganda; and guerrillas from al-Qaeda in the 

Arabian Peninsula across the Gulf of Aden in Yemen (TURSE, 2012). However, the 

fight against terrorism can be seen as a strategic tactic whose goals go beyond mere 

"war on terrorism". 

Many authors69 argue that at a strategic level by increasing military presence in Africa 

the U.S. may target the access to natural resources and indirectly China’s intensive 

presence in Africa. Although empirically it is more difficult to examine this, China is at 

least one of the potential reasons for U.S. military presence in Africa, and the US Africa 

Command (AFRICOM), seen by China as “unpleasant and out of sorts”70, has been the 

main instrument in achieving this goal. Peter Pham stated in 2007 that AFRICOM’s 

main objective is “protecting access to hydrocarbons and other strategic

resources…ensuring that no other interested third parties, such as China, India, Japan, 

or Russia, obtain monopolies or preferential treatment”.71 By using U.S. troops as part 

of the new African Command, some authors argue that the U.S. is intending to increase 

its presence in certain oil-rich areas, such as Sudan, Libya, Angola, Nigeria, Uganda, 

Kenya, ensuring in this way a beneficial investment climate for American oil firms and 

weaking China’s relations with African governments. Moreover, AFRICOM’s presence 

may threaten the political influence that China has established both on the continent and 

in international bodies. 

Another consideration in the implementation of AFRICOM is to help to control 

strategic waterways and important ports around the continent. Since mid-2000 the U.S. 

Navy has significantly increased its presence in African waters, especially on the West 

African coast. In addition to other goals, such as combating piracy, illegal fishing and 

illegal trafficking, the fact remains that oil forms the primary interest and determines the 

nature of U.S. policy towards West Africa (and AFRICOM activities)72. In 2011 the 

Ambassador J. Anthony Holmes argued that the U.S. wants to “ensure that the system 

operates without disruption”.73 Thus, some authors believe that “U.S. navy ships 

patrolling these areas could help reestablish maritime security” (CRUZ and 

STEPHENS, 2010), and enable Washington to secure its strategic interests. On the other 

hand, some analysts argue that by expanding its military “arsenal” in African waters, the 

U.S. Navy is strategically trying to control in the future the transportation of oil and 

other minerals from Africa to China.74  

U.S. Officials claim that their increasing military engagement in Africa is a strategic 

partnership for cooperation, development and support for fighting terrorism. By 

incorporating military and security interests with development, the U.S. aims to 

embrace a strategy different than former policy mainly focused on a “hard power” 

policy. According to some authors, “AFRICOM could be part of a greater U.S. foreign 

policy strategy for “smart power” in the developing world” in order to win trust among 

African countries (CRUZ and STEPHENS, 2010, p. 195). The activities intended to 

fight terrorism and provide security could be classified as ‘hard power’, whereas other 

programs, such as military training and education programs, and humanitarian projects,

are intended to build ‘soft power’. As Nye observes, “the military can sometimes play 

an important role in the generation of soft power” (NYE, 2008, p. 106). However, the 

AFRICOM military programs don’t seem to generate soft power, since suspicions and 

skepticism has been raised regarding its main motives, making it harder to find partners 

for the implementation of the program.75  The diminished credibility of American policy 

as a result of the Iraq war, as well as the incapacity of the Department of Defense in 

adequately explaining how the command will help African countries, aroused a fear that 

the U.S. was militarizing its foreign policy in Africa.76 As Michelle Ruiters, a senior 

researcher at the Institute for Global Dialogue puts it “AFRICOM would destabilize an 

already fragile continent and region, which would be forced to engage with U.S. 

interests on military matters”. 77 China, on the other hand, at the moment does not use 

military pressure to achieve agreements with African countries; it uses a “soft power” 

policy based on flexibility, consistency and pragmatism, which in turn provides 

transparency, legitimacy, accountability, visibility and recognition among African 

countries. 

In spite of the attempts of U.S. efforts in projecting a soft power message, its military 

presence in Africa is still questionable.

In order to better understand U.S. actions in Africa, it is important to acknowledge 

the rivalry between the U.S. and China in the international context. Since the late 80’s, 

China’s rise has being viewed with uncertainty and anxiousness in the U.S. Its rapid 

economic growth, its rising power and influence in the world, “raised the specter of a 

new global rivalry for power and influence (FRIEDBERG, 2005, p. 7). The U.S. 

prevalent debate has focused on two main schools of thoughts: liberalism - essentially 

optimistic - and realism - distinctly pessimistic. The main opinion in the U.S. is that a 

rising China has reshaped the existing global order and challenged the global leadership 

of the U.S. (ZHOU, 2011, p. 626). American pessimists from the realist school argue 

that China possesses a “big challenge”78 for the U.S. and a great power rivalry between 

China and the U.S. is inevitable. Additionally, realists defend that China’s growing

economic power and influence in the world, will translate into increased military power 

and allow China to reshape the rules and institutions of the international system to better 

serve its interests. 79  

On the other side, proponents of the liberal perspective suggest that U.S. officials 

should pursue an engagement policy instead of a containment one, since they believe 

that by reinforcing bilateral economic exchanges and institutional ties will create shared 

interests and reduce the uncertainty of a belligerent China. Liberal authors consider that 

the expansion of China’s involvement in the international institutions will promote 

communication and mutual understanding, reducing at the same time the prospects for 

conflict. 80  

These two main visions have also influenced the debate on China’s engagement in 

Africa. There are four key concerns that dominate U.S. discussions with respect to the 

Chinese presence in Africa. The first major concern is defended by the realist followers 

who argue that the growing Chinese interest in Africa will directly affect the U.S. 

interests in ensuring access to African oil. According to BROOKES and SHIN (2006), 

Chinese investment in the African oil sector is a way of deliberately blocking the 

supplies to importing countries and keeping the U.S. out of African markets, advocating 

that the only way to ensure U.S. interests in Africa is through increased economic and 

military presence on the continent. 	
  

The second concern is focused on structural aspects regarding how China conducts 

business in Africa - calling into question the fundamental values of the West, 

particularly human rights, transparency and good governance practices.81 Some authors 

fear that its strong sense of autonomy, independence, and no strings attached policy can 

easily cease the long efforts of the U.S. to "improve" the African regimes regarding 

their transparency, governance and corruption. 

Furthermore, another realist perspective argues that Chinese expansion in Africa is part 

of an overall strategy to challenge U.S. leadership in the world. According to this 

vision, China’s growing economic and strategic power contributes to a major change in 

the balance of power over strategic and economic influence on the African continent,

which can bring a high potential for conflict and a change in terms of world 

leadership.82 

 Finally, a more liberal and optimistic view, seeking to calm "the spirits", claims that 

‘‘the current state of China-Africa links is not a significant foreign policy threat to 

America’s interest in Africa” (YI-CHONG, 2008). According to this latter view, 

China’s engagement in Africa should be seen as an opportunity for the U.S. since there 

are many areas for cooperation between the two countries.83  

By analyzing these political views, it is possible to see that the U.S. is also using 

political strategies as a response to China’s activities in Africa. Although U.S. officials 

do not mention any country by name, often their remarks in official visits and speeches 

can be interpreted as a swipe at China. Hillary Clinton in her visit to Africa in 2011 

mentioned “It is easy to come in, take out natural resources, pay off leaders and leave.” 

Moreover, she characterized China as a new imperialist power in Africa stating that, 

“Africa must beware of “new colonialism” as China expands ties there and focus 

instead on partners able to help build proactive capacity on the continent”.  

Furthermore, the Chinese separation of business interests from political concerns is seen 

by the Americans as an obstacle to African democratization. U.S. officials warn that 

China’s support for dictatorial regimes undermines development initiatives on the 

continent. U.S. officials aim to convince the Africans that economic progress is possible 

even with high standards for human rights, democracy and good governance. Winning 

the hearts of the people and African officials by convincing them that America is a force 

of “good” which offers stability and security, has been the key play of the Obama 

administration. Nevertheless, the projection of good governance and democracy is 

sometimes called into question, especially when energy and security interests are at 

stake. The U.S. relationship with African dictatorial regimes, rich in natural resources, 

is important to U.S. energy and security, and has been recognized by Obama, as he 

mentioned that,“our security interests will sometimes require that we work with regimes 

with which we have fundamental disagreements”.84 The U.S. may often support oil rich 

countries that may have bad human rights and good governance records as long as they

guarantee a steady flow of oil to the U.S. This view is also shared by the Chinese 

officials who perceive the U.S. zeal on democracy and good governance as hypocritical. 

In brief, it is obvious that the U.S., like China, intends to pursue a “soft power” policy 

with African countries. Both countries have been very active on the African continent, 

but always cautious in their speeches and in diplomatic and political initiatives. In 

reality the two pursue their interests always “under the veil of moral superiority” (YI-

CHONG, 2008, p. 15).

CONCLUSION	
  

 

Before moving to the conclusions drawn from this dissertation, let’s recall the 

central research question: Has Chinese presence in Africa prompted an increase in 

American involvement in the continent, and if so, in what way?  

First of all, it’s important to note that the competition for Africa is not recent, quite the 

contrary. Currently the "new scramble" for is taking place among the world's big powers 

and emerging countries, which are competing for commercial, political and geostrategic 

interests. Both China and the U.S. are using all their political and diplomatic efforts to 

ensure their interests on the continent.  

Secondly, it is evident that since 2000, the U.S. - which comparing with other countries 

has never had a huge involvement and interest in Africa - has been increasing its 

presence on the continent, resulting in a competition with China. The analysis of various 

factors made throughout this research leads us to conclude that the U.S. involvement in 

African is largely due to the prominent presence of China on the continent. However, it 

would be a mistake to conclude that this is the only reason. Although there is a positive 

correlation between the two variables, the fast-growing U.S. presence in Africa can also 

be associated to a number of strategic interests important for the U.S. Economically, 

Africa is an increasingly important supplier of natural resources and a region with great 

investment and business opportunities. Besides this, the U.S. is seeking political support 

from African countries and has shown a great concern for security issues and instability 

on the continent, taking actions to combat terrorism and maintain security.  

Thirdly, although, the U.S. doesn’t have a clear and proactive strategy for China’s 

presence in Africa, there is an increase need to counter its [China] influence on the 

continent. By doing that the U.S. is intending to increase its diplomatic, military and 

economic influence throughout Africa, which will give Washington a better position to 

gain, for the first time, political dominance in the region, to ensure the access to natural 

resources and to expand its military actions against the “war on terror”.  

The competition to achieve these strategic objectives emanates from the nature of this 

rivalry as well as the structure of the present international system. In this sense one can 



27	
  
	
  

conclude that the subject of the study discussed in this dissertation follows the 

theoretical realist approach initially mentioned, whereby both the U.S. and China will 

try to gain a position where they can use all their power to promote their interests, since 

there is no one else that they can count on. In effect both countries are trying to gain 

relative power by different forms. On one hand, China is using its “soft power” policy 

based on non-interference into the internal affairs of a nation and no strings attached 

approach, which gives China a marked advantage over the U.S. in their interaction with 

Africa. On the other hand, to counter China’s influence and ensure its strategic interests, 

the U.S. has been using diplomatic, military and economic instruments to strengthen 

partnerships with its new allies and “friends” and increase its military capabilities on the 

continent; develop new economic initiatives with certain countries. These initiatives 

highlight the action-reaction effect, which I believe to be the main characteristic of 

American -Sino competition on the continent. Furthermore, I can also conclude that the 

American actions have been developed under a political strategy that can be summed up 

as "follow my words, not my deeds”. This means that, while the U.S. is using all its 

economic and military initiatives, it is clear that it doesn’t intend to attack China 

directly, being cautious on their official speeches for fears of losing the support of 

African countries.    Above all, the U.S. intends to use its values of democracy, respect 

for human right and good governance, sometimes under an almost ideological 

discourse, to encourage Africa to move away from China, showing that while China is 

above all interested in Africa’s resources, the U.S. is concerned with the Africa’s 

economic, political and democratic progress.	
   

The basic morality and the return of soft power seem to shape the resources scramble in 

Africa. The instruments of power used by the Obama administration can be identify as 

being part from a “smart power” strategy, which has become the core principle of 

Obama’s foreign policy in Africa, but also in the world. When analyzing the American- 

Sino competition from a global perspective, one can say that the “smart power” policy 

is the recognition of the “relativization” of the American Power and the fact that, in 

Nye’s phrase, “the U.S. can’t go alone”.  Theoretically speaking I would say that this 

competition represents a combination of neoliberalism and defensive realism, 

characterized by cautiousness, cooperation, and alliance-building. 

Is this political strategy a new way of engaging the competition for natural resources in 

Africa? Is Africa a testing ground for both powers to decide their global position? 

Although there is too early to know the answers to these questions, the truth is that, 



28	
  
	
  

China's interest in Africa caused a sort of alert among Western powers and African 

traditional partners, and this dissertation is the proof of that.  

This dissertation covers only a few main aspects of the American-Sino rivalry. 

Hopefully, however, it has managed to set the ground for further research on this matter. 

Therefore it is recommended that further studies be conducted in the following areas: 

understand the impact of the competition on stability in Africa; comprehend how 

competition for strategic interests in Africa is reshaping the global, political, and 

economic order; further research is need to determine the real dimension of the U.S. 

military involvement in Africa, and how this is affecting China’s activity in Africa; and 

whether or not this competition could precipitate conflicts among major power.
