RESUMO 

 
O presente estudo visa apresentar uma rota para obtenção de porosidade 
superficial em substratos de zircônia, utilizando um processo de 
deposição de camadas para a produção de sistemas com porosidade 
controlada a serem aplicados, principalmente, em próteses de zircônia. 
O objetivo do desenvolvimento foi mimetizar estruturas naturais, como 
ossos e dentes, ambos com gradientes estruturais para desempenhar 
diferentes papéis: estimular o crescimento de novo tecido ósseo e a 
osteointegração, ou atuar como interface entre componentes 
dissimilares. Desta forma, o objetivo principal deste estudo foi produzir 
um gradiente de porosidade na superfície de substratos de zircônia, 
através da deposição consecutiva de camadas com tamanhos de poros 
diferentes - obtido pelo empacotamento de partículas esféricas de 
diferentes tamanhos; a produção de camadas homogêneas (somente um 
tamanho de partículas/poros) foi necessária a fim de se otimizar cada 
parcela precursora do gradiente. As deposições foram feitas por dip 
coating, utilizando suspensões cerâmicas de grânulos esféricos de 
zircônia (Z40, Z70 e Z100 – nomeados após análise de tamanho médio 
de partícula, em µm) para formar diferentes porosidades. Os primeiros 
ensaios testaram três condições do pó Z40: não tratado, pré-sinterizado 
(1150ºC) e sinterizado (1500ºC); e posteriormente, a adição de 
partículas finas (F) ao sistema, a fim de interferir na coesão entre 
partículas maiores. A segunda parte dos testes considerou as outras duas 
camadas (Z70 e Z100), com sua relação de F otimizada, e a deposição 
consecutiva das três camadas para alcançar o gradiente de porosidade. A 
porosidade desejada foi obtida com o pó precursor pré-sinterizado, que 
garantiu o formato esférico das partículas durante todo o processo; a 
presença de F produziu pontes de ligação entre partículas grossas, 
aumentando a coesão das camadas, influenciando diretamente em sua 
resistência mecânica. O tratamento térmico entre imersões (em camadas 
com deposições sequenciais) foi necessário para prevenir a perda de 
material depositado para o meio aquoso. A presença das camadas 
aumentou a resistência à flexão dos substratos puros de zircônia; suas 
espessuras (ou o número de imersões), porém, não foram relevantes na 
melhoria da resistência. O gradiente de porosidade mostrou-se viável de 
ser produzido, com potencial para ser aplicado em próteses de zircônia, 
tanto para modificação superficial como para impregnação com 
componentes medicamentosos. 
 
Palavras-chave: zircônia, dip coating, camadas porosas, FGM. 



 
 

 
 

 

 

 



 
 

ABSTRACT 

 
The present study was conducted to present a route to obtain surface 
porosity on zirconia substrates, using a layer-by-layer deposition process 
for the production of controlled porosity systems, to be primarily 
applied on zirconia prostheses. The goal of the development was to 
mimic natural structures, such as bones and teeth, both presenting 
structural gradients to perform different roles: stimulate growth of new 
bone tissue and/or osteointegration, or act as interface between 
dissimilar components. Thus, the main objective of this study was to 
produce a gradient of porosity on the surface of zirconia substrates 
through consecutive deposition of layers with different pore sizes – 
obtained by the packing of spherical particles of different sizes; 
production of homogeneous layers (only one particle/pore size) was 
needed in order to optimize each precursor portion of the gradient. The 
depositions were made by dip coating, using ceramic suspensions of 
zirconia spherical granules (Z40, Z70 and Z100 – named after particle 
size, d50, in µm) to form different porosities. First tests were made with 
Z40 powder under three conditions: untreated, pre-sintered (1150°C) 
and sintered (1500°C); followed by addition of fine particles (F) to the 
system to investigate improvement of cohesion among large particles. 
The second part of the tests considered the other two layers (Z70 and 
Z100), with optimized F content, and the consecutive deposition of all 
layers to reach the porosity gradient. The desired porosity was obtained 
with the pre-sintered precursor powder, which ensured the spherical 
shape of the particles throughout the whole process; the presence of F 
guaranteed cohesion between coarse particles, enhancing mechanical 
properties of the layers. Heat treatment between immersions (on 
sequential deposited layers) was necessary to prevent loss of deposited 
material into the aqueous medium. The presence of layers increased 
flexural strength of pure zirconia substrates; however, its thicknesses (or 
number of immersions) were not relevant on the resistance 
improvement. The porosity gradient was feasible to be produced, with 
potential to be applied in zirconia prostheses, both for surface 
modifications and/or impregnation of medical components.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 

The idea to produce a gradient of porosity on the surface of dense 
zirconia arose from the need to improve adherence between zirconia 
(core) and porcelain (surface) of dental crowns, which often cracks due 
to a weak interface. The structural function of the gradient would act for 
interpenetration of porcelain, to form a gradual transition of materials. 
To develop the gradient, a layer-by-layer technique was chosen for the 
advantages of good control of layer’s microstructures. This concept has 
become attractive for its applicability in several areas and materials. 

The dip coating process is effective in this procedure for its 
easiness, low cost and a good control on characteristics of the deposited 
layers. Spherical particle packing concept was used for porosity 
obtainment, in which the interstices form the voids of the system. The 
main challenge of this procedure was to optimize ceramic suspensions 
and powders conditions to promote the desired porosity (content and 
morphology of pores). 

In order to reach the objective of building a gradient of porosity, 
were investigated the mechanical behavior and morphologies of the 
deposited homogeneous layers – single particle size – then, the attention 
was driven to the successive deposition of three (different particle sizes) 
homogeneous layers, ascending the order of sizes.  

 
1.1. OBJECTIVES 

 
In this way, the broader aim of this work was to build a gradient 

of porosity through successive depositions of homogeneous layers of 
different particle sizes, while specific aims were to obtain homogeneous 
porous layers of zirconia to study each one by its mechanical behavior, 
interconnectivity of pores and particularities.  

The development of porous surfaces of zirconia over dense 
substrates of the same material was interesting basically for two reasons: 
first, for zirconia being widely used in the biomedical field, composing 
dental and orthopedic prostheses; and second, for rough surfaces 
allowing better osteointegration, besides the potential interpenetrating 
structure that permits its combination with a second material, forming a 
FGM.

1.2. STRUCTURE OF THE STUDY 
 
The study consists of five chapters that include the present 

Introduction, with a broad approach to the themes addressed. 
 In Chapter 2, a review of literature is presented, which intends to 

present the properties and characteristics of biomaterials, most focused 
on zirconia based materials; the importance of porous structures and 
superficial graded porosity (FGM’s); and finally, a summary of the dip 
coating method as a way to build the layer-by-layer structure, and how 
the involved forces act in the packing of particles, achieving the 
expected porosity.  

Chapter 3 encompasses an article that focuses on the study of the 
required conditions to produce porous layers with the particle size of 
Z40 (d50 = 40 µm), and the optimized route to obtain proper cohesion 
and adherence of the layers.  

Chapter 4 embraces the second article, which uses the studied 
conditions (of the previous chapter) to produce layers using other 
particle sizes (Z70 and Z100), and then, to apply all by successive 
depositions, in order to obtain gradient of porosity.  

Appendix A shows the trial of different heat treatments on the 
interval of dipping. 

Appendix B contains a few images of the porous solids produced 
to obtain porosity measurements of the layers. 

At last, Appendix C presents the defects of structures during 
processing.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW 
 
2.1. BIOMATERIALS 
 

According to Williams, biomaterials can be defined as natural or 
synthetic substances that intend to interact with biological systems, to 
substitute partially or totally tissues, organs or functions of the body 
with the mean of keeping or increase life quality of the patient, without 
stimulating any adverse biological response to the host. Function and 
durability within the body vary considerably according to the need of 
each application and composition of introduced material (WILLIAMS, 
2009). 

Cardiovascular and orthopedic prosthesis, dental implants and 
medical devices are some of many examples of applications in different 
biomedical areas. Products that, besides offering mechanical support 
functions, also stimulate growth of new tissues and/or have controlled 
release drug systems, are among central themes of current researches of 
biomedical engineering, to provide a faster and more efficient healing to 
the patient (RATNER et al., 2013).   

Metals, polymers and ceramics/glass, and all their respective 
features, can be used within human body. Those are generally classified 
by its biological response; materials that show no interaction with body, 
and retain its structure after implantation, are called bioinert; those 
which promote bonds with living tissue are called bioactive; and those 
which are degraded and replaced by regenerating natural tissue, are 
called biodegradable. 

Biological responses are directly influenced by the surface of 
biomaterials and medical devices. Chemical and structural conditions of 
the surface enable bone growth, improve wear and corrosion resistances, 
and affect the long-term of implant, among others. Coatings or even 
changes on original surface might promote an increase in performance 
and biointeraction of clinic products, without modifying initial design 
and function, or need of retraining medical staff. Surfaces can be 
modified by three main processing methods: chemical deposition, 
coating or physical modification (etching, mechanical roughening) 
(RATNER et al., 2013). 

Implants can mix different compositions in the same product, in 
order to attend different mechanical request along a body or improve 
superficial response. The main objective is to reproduce the functions of 
the natural material that will be replaced. Proper fixation to soft tissues 

25



 
 

is important to achieve high resistance to mechanical loadings, and 
eventually promote tissue-growth. 

Osteointegration is the term applied for lamellar bone attachment 
to implant without intervening in fibrous tissue. It is required to reduce 
occurrence of stress shielding (from unequal load distribution between 
implant and bone) that leads to weakening of the host bone (MEHRALI 
et al., 2013). Bone ingrowth occurs inside a porous surface; it requires 
pore size range of 50 to 400 µm, and percentage of voids of 30 to 40% 
to preserve mechanical strength (KHANUJA, 2011). Growth rate is 
influenced by pores size and interconnectivity of pores; on the other 
hand, it is not affected by pore shape (RATNER et al., 2013).  

Therefore, the presence of porosity is considered an advantage for 
biomaterials, needed in many applications. In contrast, porosity acts as 
source of crack propagation, restricting selections of materials and 
processing conditions (JAMALUDIN et al., 2015).  

Ceramic materials are intrinsically linked to porosity. Combined 
to advanced ceramic properties, it becomes an excellent option to 
perform as biomaterial, particularly on orthopedic and dentistry fields. 
Ceramic components are mainly found in total joint arthroplasties 
(TJA), coatings on implants and devices, and dental restorations 
(MCENTIRE et al., 2015).  

Great part of products used in this class of materials are 
composed by alumina, hydroxyapatite (HA), glass-ceramics and 
zirconia; and resorbable compositions include calcium sulfate, 
tricalcium phosphate and calcium-phosphate salts (RATNER et al., 
2013). Hydroxyapatite is a calcium-phosphate ceramic, with similar 
composition of bone and dentin minerals. Known for being 
osteoconductive – that induces formation of new bone tissue –, it’s the 
most “famous” bioceramic used on substitution of bone tissues, bone 
grafts and teeth (OLIVEIRA, 2010). Alumina is the pioneer of ceramic 
biomaterials for its well-known mechanical properties; it is bioinert and 
resistant to corrosion at in vivo environments. Glass-ceramics have 
become known as bioactive ceramics, allocated on implant’s surface to 
create an adherent interface that withstands high mechanical stresses 
(RATNER et al., 2013). And zirconia is the one with best mechanical 
properties, perfect to load-bearing applications. Its bright color also 
enables it to be applied on dentistry, adjusting composition to match the 
teeth color of the patient.  

The interest for all-ceramic implants has grown with the 
development of new processing technologies and with favorable clinical 
observations. For example, the need of cement in metallic implants to 

26



 

promote fixation has brought biological problems related to wear debris; 
this leads to development of all- ceramic cementless implants, with 
improved design, increased durability and most recommended to young 
patients, who request higher mechanical loads and longer useful life 
(PETSATODIS et al., 2010; KHANUJA, 2011). On dentistry, 
advantages of metal-free implants increase all-ceramic systems demand, 
by aesthetical improvement and lower biological response (MIYAZAKI 
et al., 2013).  

 Thus, the selection of biomaterials and its manufacturing 
techniques must consider function, interaction expected to host body, 
and also the environment that it will be applied. All conditions can cause 
structural changes on material and compromise its efficiency (RATNER 
et al., 2013). 

 
Dental materials 

 
The progress on aesthetic aspects of artificial teeth has brought 

loss of mechanical strength due to fragile nature of ceramic materials. 
Adaptions on compositions turn adversities into suitable properties of 
dental restorations, withstanding different conditions of humidity, pH, 
cyclic loadings, among others. 

All-ceramic implants conquered dentistry with products of good 
mechanical properties, resistance to oral environment, competitive price, 
and good aesthetics, favorable factors for the complete replacement of 
metals on oral implants. Compositions can vary depending on design of 
implant, for being necessary different characteristics in each place of the 
piece. Generally, core structures are made with polycrystalline ceramics 
with higher strength, such as zirconia and alumina, while superface 
covering consist of porcelain and/or glass to achieve pleasing aesthetics 
(KELLY; BENETTI, 2011). 

Its combination with metals provides dental implants with 
excellent properties but unwanted aesthetic effect. So, the last three 
decades were crucial for dentistry to develop technologies for 
production of all-ceramic systems, such as hot-pressing, slip-casting 
and, the most recent, CAD-CAM (Computer Aided Design-Computer 
Aided Machining) (DENRY; HOLLOWAY, 2010). 

Dental implants are generally composed of three main parts, as 
shown in Figure 2.1: (a) the central structure fixed to the gum tissue, 
playing the role of tooth root; (b) the core structure, an abutment 
attached to the fixed structure, associated with pulp and dentin; and (c) 
the crown, the outer part of the tooth. Thus, each part has the specific 

27



 
 

function of replacing certain structure of the tooth. Structure (a) is 
commonly made of metal for being easier to machine, but there are also 
options of ceramic models. Structure (b) is generally made of zirconia 
based ceramics, due to its mechanical resistance. And the last structure 
(c) is composed by a mix of zirconia and porcelain and/or glass, with 
function of aesthetic finish and protection of aggressive conditions of 
mouth.

implant.

Replacement of dental crowns should reproduce structural 
transition from dentin to enamel. It is important to emphasize that 
transition between both materials must be sufficiently consolidated to 
avoid detachment during use (BARANI et al., 2012). A wide range of 
surface modifications is used in dental implant, from structural changes 
(mentioned in previous chapter) to adding material (adhesives, sealants, 
etc.). This process guarantees consolidation of two or more materials 
(ZHANG; KIM, 2009). 

Transition between substructures shall be made with absence of 
stress zones derived from mismatch on mechanical or thermal properties 
on contact of different materials. Natural tooth show a distribution of 
properties along its extension, which can help on support of mechanical 
stresses. In addition, clinical cases verified that abrupt transition of 

28



 

structures (b) and (c) could be the reason of early failures on dental 
implants, by detachment of those two materials (BARANI et al., 2012). 

In this way, many techniques are being studied in order to soften 
this transition by creating a functionally graded material (FGM’s), for 
example, in order to mimetize nature with its capability of stress 
distribution (ZHANG; KIM, 2009).  

Some variables can affect performance, reliability and useful life 
of implants, including intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic factors 
include amount of crystalline phase, which varies from 35 to 99% vol., 
size and geometry of crystals, mismatch of Young´s modulus and/or 
thermal coefficients between core and surface; also processing 
conditions play a fundamental role on the control of its microstructures. 
Extrinsic factors are the aggressive environment of mouth, including 
great variation on pH, temperature, humidity and loads – cyclic and 
peak loads –, that expose materials to degradation and corrosion on 
contact with humidity even at low temperatures. Mechanical 
characterization under humidity and cyclic loading is necessary to attest 
quality and reliability of products (LAWSON, 1995; KELLY, 1999). 
Oral adversities can be the major cause of early failure of dental 
implants (DENRY; HOLLOWAY, 2010). 

However, crystallinity is only one of the factors that contribute to 
material’s performance. Crystal’s size and geometry, modulus of 
elasticity, phase transformation and compatibility of thermal expansion 
coefficients (among dissimilar materials) are also responsible for their 
performances (DENRY; HOLLOWAY, 2010). 

In the quest to minimize defects originated in interfaces within a 
structure, development of all-ceramic pieces has gained space in the 
market, with zirconia as the main protagonist, in the YSZ form, playing 
the role of both implant (1) and abutment (2). But aesthetic finishing 
recovering are still needed in dental crowns. Therefore, some studies 
turn their attention to this interface, in an attempt to create ideal 
conditions for a healthy transition. At this point, concepts of FGM 
(discussed in chapter 2.4) showed interesting designs to solve this issue. 

 
2.2. ZIRCONIA 
 

Success of zirconia ceramics was due to a combination of 
strength, toughness and chemical resistance, allowing it to be used in 
applications on harsh environments and under severe loading conditions. 
Studied since 1960´s, this material is extensively used as thermal barrier 
coating (TBC) in gas and jet turbine engines, membranes in solid oxide 

29



 
 

fuel cells (SOFC), optical coatings, security devices, knife blades and 
cutting tools, oxygen sensors, biomedical devices, among others (LUO 
et al., 1998).  

The zirconium oxide, with formula ZrO2, has three possible 
crystalline arrangements: monoclinic (m) structure at room temperature, 
tetragonal (t) structure for temperatures from 1170°C to 2370°C and 
cubic (c) structure for up to 2370°C, with melting point at 2716°C. 
During cooling, transformation t?m is accompanied by a volumetric 
expansion of 3 to 5%, which generates stress on microstructure that 
could lead material to fracture; but it’s also the key for toughening 
mechanisms. The discovery that addition of elements could control 
structures and/or phase transformations on zirconia based ceramics has 
sparked the interest in scientific community for its similarity with steel 
alloys, both exhibiting martensitic transformation at relative low 
temperatures, used to enhance strength and fracture toughness at 
controlled compositions. For this reason, zirconia alloys were also 
known as “ceramic steel” (HANNINK et al., 2000). 

 So, the use of small amounts of stabilizers has become very 
common to keep metastability of tetragonal and/or cubic phases (high-
temperature phases), at room temperature. Different oxides are used to 
stabilize partially or totally those phases; generally, alkaline earth 
oxides, such as CaO and MgO, are used for partially stabilized zirconia 
(PSZ), while Y2O3 and CeO2 are used for stabilization of t phase, such 
as tetragonal zirconia polycrystals (TZP), and cubic phase, fully 
stabilized zirconia (FSZ). These systems are usually named associated 
with added component (ex.: Mg-PSZ, Y-TZP, etc.) (KELLY; DENRY, 
2008). 

The toughening mechanism on TZP systems occurs on fine grains 
of metastable t phase that transform by cooling at temperatures lower 
than 25°C or is induced by stress, in regions around a hardness 
indentation or surrounding the tip of a crack (Figure 2.2). Volumetric 
expansion of the grains blocks crack propagation and prevent forming 
new cracks. Modifications on microstructure occurs locally on presence 
of stress, where is visible some m laths between t grains (predominant). 
In PSZ systems, metastable t phase with lenticular grains are precipitate 
in a stable c phase matrix. The metastable phase can transform 
spontaneously in m from rapid cooling of high temperatures, and under 
a stress field (HANNINK et al., 2000).

t?m transformation on a induced crack.

 This mechanism has become so well known that use of zirconia 

based ceramics has been easily diffused in medical and dental areas by 
its efficient mechanical performance, replacing metal alloys on many 
devices. In 2001, a setback has slowed the production of zirconia 
medical products due to failures of 400 implanted devices in a short 
period, occurred by aging of the microstructure in contact with body 
fluids. This episode was due to a change on the process parameter on a 
factory of zirconia prostheses. At that time, thousands of zirconia 
prostheses had already been implanted around the world, especially in 
the USA and Europe, which have brought concerns about 
standardization of implant materials. This episode has put zirconia 
momentarily in check for “inside-body” applications, until studies 
disrupted functioning and effects of aging mechanisms (CHEVALIER, 
2006).  

This phenomenon, also called low thermal degradation (LTD), is 
defined by the spontaneous t?m transformation at low temperatures, 
without influence of any local load. The contact with water induces 
transformation of t grains, which expansion provokes uplift on the 

31



 
 

surface and pushes the untransformed grains around, creating a stress 
field (Figure 2.3-b). But micro cracks may appear from displacement of 
m grains, facilitating the entry of water into the structure, and thus, 
increasing amount of m grains that tend to peel off from structure 
(Figure 2.3-c). The effects of aging include loss of mechanical 
properties, density and toughness, accompanied by macro and micro 
cracks and increased m phase content. The intrinsic factors that 
influence LTD’s susceptibility are: type and amount of stabilizer, grain 
size and residual stresses (LUGHI; SERGO, 2010; PICONI, C., 2011).

zirconia grains, and how tensile stress is introduced into the microstructure on 
LTD phenomenon.

Despite all efforts to prevent this phenomenon, zirconia cannot be 
considered an aging-free material since transformation is a natural 
tendency to monoclinic equilibrium state. But kinetic of transformations 
are strongly influenced by microstructure, which, in turn, is affected by 
small amounts of additives. 

 
Yttria stabilized zirconia 

 
Addition of yttria to zirconia causes microstructural changes that 

allow its performance in different fields due to its chemical inertness, 
thermal stability and high ionic conductivity at high temperatures. 
Depending on added amount, phase diagram varies temperature of m, t 
and c phases transformations, as seen at its phase diagram in Figure 2.4; 
and consequently varies its main characteristics by its microstructure. 

Zirconia ceramic with 8% mol. yttria is among most used 
commercial zirconia “alloys”. It is considered a FSZ for its predominant 
cubic phase structure, with increased stability at high temperatures. Any 
composition with cubic phase at beginning of firing, and intact structure 
at room temperature, can be considered “fully stabilized”. Cubic 
zirconia has a very low thermal conductivity, desired property for 
thermal coating barriers (TBC); also shows high ionic conductivity for 
oxygen at high temperatures, used as fuel cell membranes (MARTIN, 
2011). 

The substitution of Z4+ for Y3+, on charge stabilization of yttria-
zirconia mixture, creates oxygen vacancies that act on stabilization of 
tetragonal and cubic phases, but also increase ion conductivity. Addition 
between 4 and 10% mol. of yttria results in a favorable proportion for 
ion conductivity. 

The TZP has predominant tetragonal phase in its structure, 
stabilized with 2 – 4% mol. of yttria, with small crystal grains associated 
with improved strength, fracture toughness and resistance to wear and 
aging. It’s prone to toughening mechanism that increases its fracture 
resistance, able to be applied as a structural material. It has been seen in 
industrial parts and everyday products, such as ceramic knives (KELLY; 
DENRY, 2008), but it is on biomedical field that has been gaining more 
space. Medical applications of Y-TZP include surgical tools, 
instrumentation, surgical implants, orthopedic (femoral ball-heads), 
while dental applications include full and partial coverage crowns, 
orthodontic brackets, implant abutments, veneers, extracoronal 
attachments, among others (VAGKOPOULOU et al., 2009).

Commercial zirconia is often produced with binders and other 

additives that facilitate its processing, and guarantee non-incidence of 
aging. Its good mechanical characteristics combined with toughening 
mechanism and biocompatibility, have made it the main competitor of 
titanium, used in biomedical load-bearing applications, and overcome 
properties of alumina, as shown in (Table 2.1).

2.3. POROUS STRUCTURES/POROUS CERAMICS 
 

Porous structures have already been considered problematic from 
a mechanical point of view, with limited applications. Over time, 
porosity has become known to be associated with thermal insulation, 
acoustic properties, permeability and increased surface area, brought the 
interest of new fields of applications and development of porous 
materials (COLOMBO; SCHEFFER, 2005). 

All classes of materials have examples of porous structures; 
cellular properties of both are influenced by the same set of factors, 
which include: (i) mechanical properties of (dense) material; (ii) amount 
and morphology (shape and size) of pores; (iii) connectivity of pores; 
and (iv) relative density. These factors will dictate the mechanical, 
electrical and thermal properties of the final piece (COLOMBO; 
SCHEFFER, 2005). 

According to IUPAC, porous structures are classified by the 
average pore size range: microporous to &amp;lt;2 nm; mesoporous 2 to 50 
nm; and above 50 nm, macroporous (PERKO, 2012). Interconnected 
pores, also known as open porosity, composes fluid (liquid or gas) 
transport structures, like scaffolds and others biomedical applications, 
filters and catalyst supports; while pores that are not connected with 
others, called closed porosity, are very common on thermal insulators, 
such as refractories, kiln furnitures and heat exchangers. Thus, 
interconnectivity of pores influences thermal properties of materials 
(WERR, 2014). 

The combination of porous structures and ceramic materials 
results in low density, high stiffness and low specific heat bodies. These 

35



 
 

characteristics are essential to technological applications like filters for 
molten metals and hot gases, and biomedical devices. A variety in shape 
and distribution of pore form several structures such ceramic foams, 
honeycombs and hollow spheres (COLOMBO; SCHEFFER, 2005). 

Among many processing routes to obtain porous ceramics, there 
are: the use of sacrificial templates, use of narrow particle size 
distribution and controlled sintering stage. Sacrificial templates are 
widely used for porous solids fabrication, using incorporated 
components in the ceramic matrix to produce the pore structure, through 
its removal by thermal treatment. It is also very common the use of gas 
as pore former agent, introduced into ceramic suspension/slurry and 
removed after solidification of the body; its morphology determines size 
and shape of pores. Generally, formation of pores by this method occurs 
through formation of foams, consolidated by sintering, requiring 
additives as surfactants, turning it to complex systems (STUDART et 
al., 2006; WERR, 2014).  

Sintering considers work with different temperatures to reach a 
proper diffusion rate. Ceramics generally follow a specific densification 
curve; first, the increase of temperature induces volumetric diffusion, 
that creates necks among particles, called as pre-sintering stage; and 
after that, higher temperatures lead to higher diffusion rates, increasing 
densification and shrinkage of material. Depending on diffusion, it can 
control porous systems (WERR, 2014). 

Through the control of particle size distribution of ceramic 
powder, it’s possible to predict its packing density. For example, 
unimodal distributions of spherical particles, with narrow range of sizes, 
have lower density in its packing arrangement. The space between 
spheres is large enough to not collapse during sintering ( 

Figure 2.5), forming pores with controlled size by controlling heat 
treatment steps (WERR, 2014).  

In this mechanism, a previous consolidation on ceramic powder 
surface may be necessary in order to prevent closed porosity during 
sintering of the body. 

Porous films manufacturing techniques are being developed to 
enable surface modifications of technological products. These 
modifications are important to increase superficial areas, create 
interfaces, and stimulate external responses in contact with another 
material and/or tissue. Dip coating, slip and tape casting are methods 
that use ceramic suspensions on formation of porous membranes, with 
controlled range of porosity and thickness. Other techniques are used to 

36



 

promote partial densification, pore orientation and heterogeneous 
distributions of voids along a section.

2.4. FGM 
 

Functionally graded materials (FGM) combine two or more 
dissimilar materials by a gradient transition of structure, composition 
and/or morphology along a section, resulting materials with adequate 
properties distributed along a body, to attend different mechanical 
needs. A soft transition helps to improve adherence and decrease 
mismatch of mechanical, thermal and even chemical properties 
(MEHRALI et al., 2013).  

Incorporation of two, or more, component’s function in the same 
body is the main objective of this class of materials, using artifices as 
variation of composition, porosity, geometry and physical state as a 
manner to obtain the mixture of functions (MIYAMOTO et al., 1999). 
The transition may occur continuously or discretely, in layers format ( 

Figure 2.6). The first one is widely observed in nature, while the 
second, in laboratories. Replications are not always an easy task, and 
creation of artifices is often necessary to achieve the goal. The difficulty 
to reproduce continuous transition attracted attention to layer deposition 
techniques, as dip coating, tape casting, chemical vapor deposition 
(CVD), among many others, to recreate structures discretely. Dense 
layers between porous ones are still characteristic of FGM (UDUPA et 
al., 2014).  

A great number of nature structures with some gradation of 
property along the body served as example to create and develop this 

37



 
 

material concept. Among them are the bamboo, shells, teeth and bones 
(Figure 2.7) all of them with gradual structures according to 
environmental conditions and mechanical request (MIYAMOTO et al., 
1999).

discrete – by layers.

The increasing interest on biomaterials with functional gradient 
allows the advancement and applicability in different biological 
branches: photosynthesis, self-cleaning and self-healing materials, 
controlled-release drug systems, implants, among many others. Soft 
transitions are often found in surface areas by coatings; this concept 
enables surface modifications of medical devices and implants, 
improving its interaction with body fluid, acting as chemical shield, 
increasing surface area, or even for aesthetic finishes. An option to 
promote those characteristics is by surface porosity; a way to reproduce 
nature and improve efficiency of existing products is by creating a 

38



 

gradient of porosity, which improves structural conditions of material to 
serve as an interface with another (MARTIN, 2011).   
 

Gradient porosity 
 

In the human body, several structures with heterogeneous 
distributions of pores are seen, as the case of bones which surface is 
denser than its nucleus undergoing a gradual porosity transition (Figure 
2.8). That configuration, also called sandwich structures, leads to an 
increased bending resistance when compared to a solid beam. Porosity 
gradient on biomaterials are also attractive to improve interaction 
between dentin and enamel, on dentistry (MEHRALI et al., 2013). 
Interconnectivity of pores may act as an organizer of vascular channels, 
ensuring supply of blood and nutrients to the bone (MIAO; SUN, 2009). 

Heterogeneity of porosity (size and amount), composition and 
mechanical properties may result in structural, biological and 
mechanical optimization of porous biomaterials. The gradient of pores 
can further induce “guided” growth of new tissues and cells (MIAO; 
SUN, 2009). This configuration also reduces residual thermal stresses 
on contact between dissimilar materials, leading to early fracture of 
products (MANICONE et al., 2007).

Examples of basic shapes that vary porosity content along a 
section can be seen in Figure 2.9. This structure configures a specific 
arrangement of the so-called functionally graded materials (FGM’s), 
because it changes its properties over a zone.

As mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, the gradient can be 
made continuously or by discrete configurations. Continuous transitions 
techniques are usually more expensive and require complex equipments, 
such as freeze-casting, spark plasma sintering (SPS) and electrospraying 
(into a template); while others, which result in discreet layered gradient, 
are usually cheaper but may take longer to be produced, due to the need 
for multiple depositions. Techniques for discrete porous gradient 
structures are: sintering of graded particles, multiple tape casting or dip 
coating, and slip casting. Figure 2.10 represents consecutives 
depositions of layers, with distinct pore sizes, forming a graded structure 
(MIAO; SUN, 2009).  

To produce porosity in layer deposition methods, there are two 
main routes: introduction of pore formers, such as polymers or foams, to 
be eliminated by firing at relative low temperatures and controlled 
heating rates (in order to avoid cracks generated from the extraction of 
the component); or by particle size control, so that porosity comes from 
interparticle voids formed during its packing, as discussed in chapter 
2.3.

2.5. DIP COATING 
 

Dip coating is a deposition process that uses simple mechanism 
of attraction to retain particles on a given substrate – cappilarity. The 
technique basically consists of immerging vertically a porous substrate 
in a suspension containing precursor powder, to form a film of particles 
adhered on substrate’s surface via capillary pressure (BRINKER, 2013). 
The process can be divided into four main stages: (1) immersion and 
dwell time, (2) deposition, (3) drainage and (4) evaporation. 

 
Figure 2.11 - Schematic illustration of dip coating process, and its steps.

The thickness is controlled according to process parameters, such 
as speed of withdraw, temperature and atmosphere; and chemical, such 
as dilution and solvent. A certain dwell time is necessary to guarantee 
complete wetting of the substrate during coating, which may difficult by 
high surface tension of solvents (GROSSO, 2011). 

41



 
 

Deposition stage depends on suspensions characteristics, such as 
solid content, particle size, additives, and on substrate’s structure, such 
as porosity and pore size. During withdrawal of the substrate, the 
upward movement drags the penetrated liquid into pores, while outer 
part returns to the bath, draining excess liquid from the surface (Figure 
2.12-A). Evaporation phase completes film deposition cycle, while a 
subsequent heat treatment is often necessary to eliminate organic 
residues and/or promote crystallization of functional oxides (BRINKER, 
2013). 

This method showed to be very attractive due to its simplicity, 
easiness access, regular control of thickness, waste-free, and low energy 
associated. Its drawbacks are basically related to drying, when excessive 
retraction of thick layers may provoke cracks.  

Withdraw speed influences on thickness by two different 
regimes: draining, on high speeds (&gt; 10 mm.s-1); and capillary, under 
ultra-low speed (&amp;lt;0,1 mm.s-1). This trend is represented by graph 
below (Figure 2.12-B) where thickness increases on both extremes of 
graphs, with an intermixed regime between 0.1 and 10 mm.s-1, ideal for 
thin layers fabrication. The dilution of the medium causes a downward 
shift of the curve.  

Equation 1 (Figure 2.12-C) represents the sum of both regimes 
resulting the curve (B) below; capillary term can be described as the 
evaporation rate divided by speed (E/u) –, and draining regime, solution 
characteristics times speed (Du2/3). So, thickness is dependent on a 
solution composition constant ki, withdraw speed u, evaporation rate E, 
substrate width L, and physical-chemical characteristics of solutions D. 
Both regimes are counterbalanced by evaporation (GROSSO, 2011).

withdraw speed and the three regimes of deposition; and (C) thickness equation,

Capillary pressure on porous substrate is responsible for particles 
to concentrate at the substrate-suspension interface and, thus, forms a 
film, since particles cannot “penetrate” further in the solid. It represents 
a very strong driving force to densify depositing film, and can be 
estimated by mathematical approaches. 

The medium containing precursor material, may be in the 
aqueous form, emulsion form or, the most applied of them, in sol-gel 
form. That is because sol-gel, and other chemical solution depositions 
(CSD), in some cases, increase wettability of substrates and improve 
film formation ability (KOZUKA et al., 2012). Nowadays, a wide range 
of technological applications uses sol-gel processes on coatings, such as 
sensor and actuators, superconducting layers, protective coatings, 
passivation layers, among others; therefore, many studies have already 
disrupted sol-gel mechanisms (BRINKER, 2013). However, other 
systems do not have the need for additives to improve processes 
conditions; for these, aqueous based processes can be a simpler and 
cheaper choice.  

Structural control of deposited layers depends on factors related 
to suspensions (or emulsions, sol-gel, etc.) and process parameters, 
along with precursor material characteristics. Among them are: solid 
content and viscosity of suspension, speed and time of immersion, and 
properties of powder. Particle size has an important role on thickness 
control. The range of thickness obtained by dip coating varies in 100 nm 
to 100 µm, just as pores size, depending on precursor powder and 
processing conditions.  

Mathematical and/or computational models are very effective 
tools for prediction and control of dimensional and structural parameters 
of formed membranes, although there are some restrictions about tubular 
shapes, since it involves complex mathematics about radial flows (GU; 
MENG, 1999). 

The dip coating has been applied in dentistry since 1990’s, to 
infiltrate vitreous material on a ceramic infrastructure (pre-sintered), 
creating a two-component structurally interconnected material 
(DENRY; HOLLOWAY, 2010). This type of structure, as mentioned 
before, avoids defects related to residual stress of different thermal 
properties contact; it can also enhance restoration’s ability to withstand 
mechanical loads. 

The use of ceramic precursors allows deposition of porous and 
dense films by this method. The interest in ceramic membranes reaches 
several areas: electrical, electronics, biomaterials and energetic are a 
few. YSZ plays a key role in applications such electrolyte films for solid 

43



 
 

fuel cells (SOFC) and filtration membranes, and also on orthopedic 
implants, due to their good biocompatibility and bone ingrowth property 
(LENORMAND et al., 2005; MIAO et al., 2007). 

The processing in industries is normally made with special 
equipment to control process parameters, such as speed and immersion 
time. In this way, process conditions are standardized, with controlled 
thickness and layer structure. 

It is very common the use of additives to form pore structures, by 
foam production and subsequent pyrolysis to exterminate residue 
materials. Techniques with aqueous suspension dismiss the need of a 
great number of those additives, but dispersant is an essential 
component of ceramic slurries. It prevents agglomeration of particles, 
ensuring homogenization of the system; and also affects viscosity, 
generally very important to determine process parameters. 

 
Particles packaging factors/mechanisms 
 
Packing arrangement of particles plays a decisive role in 

controlling porous systems. It is affected by few factors, such as: 
? Particle size distribution; 
? Particle’s morphology; 
? Particle’s density; 
? State of dispersion; 
? Processing of conformation. 

Monodispersion arrangements, which considers a unique size of 
spherical particles, such as atomic structures for example, predicts 
packing factors of 0,60 and 0,64, reaching up to 0,74 in ordered 
structures (CFC). Spherical particles, besides possible to predict its 
behavior, reach higher packaging densities when compared to non-
spherical, as shown in Figure 2.13 due to friction during conformation 
that produce voids among particles. Therefore, grading curve and 
particles morphology have effect on densities arrangements.

Monodispersions are considered discrete distributions of particles 
with a single size in the system; a rare situation at industrial field. 
Unimodal distributions exhibit a unique average size of particles; 
bimodal, two different average sizes; and multimodal, more than three 
peaks of average sizes. Those curves can be narrower or wider, or even 
present discontinuities, such as small gaps with absence of a certain 
particle size. 

Figure 2.13 shows the packing density of bimodal distributions of 
spherical and non-spherical particles. The peak of maximum density of 
both curves is reached by similar volume fraction of coarse powders, not 
depending on its format. However, bimodal distributions may exhibit 
different particle shapes; the higher amount of non-spherical particles, in 
relation to a mixture containing both types, the greater tendency to 
produce porosity, as shown in Figure 2.14.

spherical particles.

Internal porosity of particles also implies a lower packing density, 
since they can show close pores (like hollow) or open pores (like 
clusters). Sharp difference in particle’s densities of bimodal distributions 
can generate heterogeneous density in a product during its conformation, 
compromising mechanical performance and/or reliability. Sharp 
difference on pore sizes of a system may lead to the “wall effect”, that 
happens when fine particles interact with coarser ones as if they were 
almost plane, like a wall. This phenomenon is even greater when the 
coarser powders present porosity, attracting them by capillarity (Figure 
2.15).

The manufacturing method can use dry and wet routes. The 

difference between them is presence of water, associated with greater 
mobility of particles. Dry routes, as pressing, can increase low packing 
levels; while wet routes, which includes suspensions, are often subjected 
to capillary forces while depositing on a face (dip coating, slip casting, 
etc.). Each of these methods has certain influence on particle’s 
compaction, with the last one showing lower (and random) packing 
levels. When fluid media are part of the process, the state of dispersion 
must be considered to maximize packaging (CASTRO; 
PANDOLFELLI, 2009). 

Due to many factors that contribute to packaging, mathematical 
models has described density behavior of mixtures using different size 
distributions of powders. There are two basic concepts: Furnas model, 
which its individual particles approach; and Andreasen’s model, with its 
continuous distributions approach. Further studies concluded that both 
concepts express the same idea, by different visions; so, a mathematical 
convergence brought together both concepts into a single equation, 
known as Alfred’s model (eq. 2).  

 

     ( )     (
     

 

  
 
  

 
 ) Eq. (2) 

 
where CPTF is the “cumulative percentage finer than” D – particle 
diameter; DL is the diameter of largest particle and DS, the smallest; 
and q is the distribution’s coefficient. Computational simulations have 

47



 
 

verified that values of q lower than 0,37 might promote maximum 
packing, while higher values leads to a residual porosity. The 
distribution coefficient is affected by amount of fine particles; the 
greater the quantity of fine particles, the smaller the value of q. 

However, increase fine particles (~1 µm) fraction may interfere 
on size distribution. The tendency to agglomeration is by increase of 
relation between surface area and volume, for small particles, that 
increases interparticular cohesive forces. Its presence tends to inhibit 
spatial coordination of higher packing densities, thus, increases void 
volume (CASTRO; PANDOLFELLI, 2009). 
 
 
2.6. CURRENT TECHNIQUES 
 

Along this section, several production techniques of 
homogeneous and graded porous structures have been introduced. A 
comparison of currently used techniques is presented (Erro! Fonte de 
referência não encontrada.), relating porosity, pore size obtained in 
each referenced work, and the need of pore-forming agents, which 
increases time of production due to its removal.    

The references that made porous structures by the dip coating 
method (first lines) used raw materials with particle sizes below 5 µm. 
With zirconia, the largest pore size was 60 µm produced with particles 
of unspecified size, while alumina, the maximum was 190 µm, both 
with high porosity (%).   

Methods such slip casting and gel casting are mainly used for 
porous solids production, that is, solids with similar dimensions (not as a 
layer). Tape casting, widely used in the production of layers, was seen 
only in cases of average pore size of 2.5µm. The tape casting and gel 
casting papers have studied production of porosity by addition of pore 
former agents.  

Powder metallurgy is cited  for being related to mechanisms of 
spherical particles packing, in this case, using particles of great 
granulometry (&gt; 180 µm) to form structures with varied pore sizes 
(gradual transition). The main difference between this and the present 
work, lies in the physical properties of the raw materials (metal vs. 
ceramic) and its behavior during sintering.  

Vacuum casting was used to obtain large pore sizes, between 300 
and 500 µm, burning expanded polystyrene for its formation. 
Eletrophoretic deposition (EPD) and electrohydrodynamic spraying 
(EDS) are methods based on the addition of sacrificial materials, and are 

48



 

attractive for allowing production of varied pore sizes. On the other 
hand, this information was extracted from reviews from both methods, 
and its possibilities of applications; for this reason, many processing 
details have been omitted in these documents. The full articles are not 
available on free research platforms. 

The present panorama highlights a lack on studies of zirconia 
macroporous structures processing. In this context, the present work 
intends to insert an inexpensive and simple alternative to obtain surface 
macroporous structures.

3. Optimized route for the production of zirconia structures 
with controlled surface porosity for biomedical applications   
 
3.1. INTRODUCTION 
 

Ceramic materials based on yttria stabilized zirconia (Y-TZP) 
present excellent mechanical properties, and are increasingly used in 
biomedical field due to their biocompatibility. High values of strength 
and fracture toughness characterize its use in orthopedic prostheses and 
dental implants, especially as core structures to withstand the higher in-
service mechanical stresses (KELLY; DENRY, 2008).  

Toughening mechanism of zirconia, involving martensitic phase 
transformations, allows the material to suppress propagation of cracks, 
attractive for many technological and “inside-body” applications that 
require a good mechanical reliability and high resistance at different 
environments. The mechanism is activated under stress, for example at 
the tip of a crack, that induces transformation of tetragonal phase 
(metastable) to monoclinic (stable at room temperature), accompanied 
by a volumetric expansion of the grains enabling closure of the crack 
(HANNINK et al., 2000; VAGKOPOULOU et al., 2009).  

Biomaterials often require the presence of porosity, either in the 
bulk or at the surface of a body. Studies have shown the increasing 
demand for cement-free implants, which improves bone integration by 
the presence of a rough surface that induces bone growth in contact with 
the natural tissue (PARK; LAKES, 2007). The porosity is also 
recommended in prostheses, to a better  distribution of stresses to the 
adjoining bone, thus minimizing the overload episodes and avoiding 
stress-shielding resultant from significant elastic differences between the 
prosthesis and bone (HEDIA; MAHMOUD, 2004). Different 
arrangements of porosity, pore size and its interconnectivity enable the 
development of various biomimetic structures (MIAO; SUN, 2009). 

The layer-by-layer deposition process can be used to elaborate 
structures with different thicknesses and features throughout a 
transversal section. The production of multi-layered parts may result, for 
instance, in functionally graded materials (FGM), known to attach 
different features in a single part (MEHRALI et al., 2013). In the case of 
biomaterials, the production of FGMs with porosity gradients is one of 
the current research targets that tend to mimic natural bones structures, 
thus combining a porous core with a denser surface (MIAO; SUN, 2009; 
MUTHUTANTRI, 2009).  

52



 

Among the available routes used in the production of ceramic 
layers, the dip coating process has the advantage of being an efficient, 
simple and inexpensive method (GROSSO, 2011). The process consists 
in immerging the substrate to coat (porous or dense) into a ceramic 
suspension and then withdrawn from it after a certain immersion time.  
The capillary pressure is then regarded for the formation of a wet 
ceramic coating over the surface with controlled thickness. The 
possibility of working with any geometry, with basically no material 
restrictions (as long as in powder format) without unnecessary 
complications, turns the process attractive to be used in different areas 
of applications (XIA et al., 2000; KOZUKA et al., 2012). 

Despite similarities with other techniques, few are the studies on 
the formation of macroporous layers using the dip coating method. The 
use of spherical ceramic particles to produce porosity by the interstices 
of its packing arrangement is a simple and easy method that required no 
pore former addition. Therefore, there is no need to eliminate organic 
additives during the process (MIAO; SUN, 2009).  

In this context, the aim of this work is to investigate the adequate 
processing conditions necessary for the production of macroporous 
zirconia coatings over zirconia substructures, using the dip coating 
method and without the presence of pore forming additives.  
 
3.2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 

 
Ceramic powder 

 
In this study, all experiments used 3% mol yttria-stabilized 

zirconia spray-dried powder (TZ-3YBE, TOSOH Co., Tokyo, Japan) 
with defined spherical shape. Powder properties are presented in Table 
3.1. In order to work with narrower size distribution range, such material 
was sieved, obtaining particles with average size (d50) of 40 µm and 
hereafter refereed as Z40 in the text. The powder size distribution was 
obtained using a particle size analyzer Mastersizer 2000 (Malvern 
Instruments, Marvern, UK).

(Source: Tosoh Co.) 
 

The first experiments aimed at testing different conditions of the 
precursor powder on the layer deposited by dip coating. For this, 
powders were divided into three groups according to the thermal 
treatment undergone: NT – no treatment; PS – pre-sintering at 
1150°C/1h; and S – sintering at 1500°C/2h. Such treatments were made 
in conventional furnace with no controlled atmosphere. Apparent 
densities of powders (on different conditions) were experimentally 
obtained by vibrating particles in a graduated cylinder and, after 
“laying” of particles, it was noted the respective volume and weight – to 
apply to the equation:  

  
    .  

The addition of fine zirconia particles (d50= 3 ?m) to the ceramic 
suspensions, aiming at increasing the bond strength between Z40 
particles, was also investigated as will be shown later. Several fine 
particles contents (5, 10, 15 and 20vol%) were added to the solid 
contents of the zirconia suspensions. Those particles, termed “Z3” from 
now on, were produced by the ultrasonication of commercial zirconia 
powder suspension (20 vol% of solids in aqueous medium), using an 
ultrasonic device (Vibra-cell VCX750, Sonics &amp;amp; Materials Inc., U.S.A.). 
No heat treatment was applied to this material. 

 
Ceramic suspensions 

 
All suspensions were prepared with fixed 30vol% of solid 

content, and dispersed in water. Previous experiments indicated the need 
of using different suspending agents in suspensions containing different 

54



 

powders. Therefore, Darvan C-N (Vanderblit Minerals, LLC, U.S.A.) 
was used to disperse suspensions with NT powder; while CMC 
(carboxymthyl cellulose, Emfal, Betim, Brazil) was used to suspend PS 
and S powders. The optimized concentration was 1% and 2%, 
respectively, in relation to total mass of solids. The mixtures were made 
by magnetic stirring. 

Rheological tests were performed using a viscometer (Thermo 
Haake VT550 Viscotester - SV 2P sensor, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., 
Germany), at room temperature, varying the shear rate up to 100 s-1, 
which is the range of the dip coating process (MORENO, 2005). 

 
Dip coating 

 

The dip coating was made on commercial yttria-stabilized 
zirconia substrates, pressed disks (190 MPa) with 10 mm of diameter – 
without heat treatment. The depositions were made in Dip Coater 
equipment (Construmaq, São Carlos, Brazil), using fixed speed and 
immersion time in 4 mm.s-1 and 5 s, respectively. After deposition, the 
pieces undergone air-drying (Appendix A) and were then sintered at 
1500°C/2h in air atmosphere. 

Layers were first coated using suspensions containing powders 
under different conditions (NT, PS and S), and thereafter, with the best 
of the three conditions, the test was continued with addition of fine 
particles. Figure 3.1 systematizes the steps conducted in this study for 
the definition of the appropriate processing route that leads to the 
production of zirconia structures with surficial macroporosity obtained 
by the dip coating method. 

 
Wear test 
 
A simple rotational wear test was applied to evaluate the integrity 

of the zirconia dip coated layers. The specimens containing dip coated 
layers made of Z40 powders and fine particles (Z3) were first weighed 
and then ball milled for 30 minutes in a plastic jar containing 10 alumina 
balls. The mass loss of each specimen (substrate + coating) was 
registered in the end of the test.  

 
Apparent porosity and mechanical strength measurements 

 

The difficulty in measuring properties such as porosity and 
mechanical strength of surficial layers led us to try to reproduce the 

55



 
 

porous structures obtained by the dip coating method, but in larger 
dimension, thus forming porous solids – easier to measurements. Slip 
casting can be considered similar to the dip coating method for sharing 
the same main mechanism of material deposition – cappilarity (related 
to mold/substrate’s porosity). In this way, porous solids samples were 
produced from the same suspensions used in the formation of layers, 
poured on a cylindrical mold (13 mm of diameter and 30 mm height), 
with an absorbent base attached (draining water by a single face, without 
pressuring). The samples dried in stove for 48 h, polished (to ensure 
parallelism among faces), and then, sintered at 1500°C/2h. 

The apparent porosity was measured by ASTM C20-00, weighing 
each specimen under three conditions: D – dry; I – immersed in water; 
and W – wet (saturated with water, removed drops from the surface). 
The apparent porosity (%) expresses the volumetric relation of open 
pores to external volume. Apparent density (g/cm³) represents the 
quotient of the dry weight divided by the total volume, including pores. 
All calculations consider water density as 1 g/cm³, and sintered zirconia 
(theoretical) as 6,05 g/cm³. 

Uniaxial compression tests were applied to these samples. The 
height disparity of the specimens remained h/D relation between 0,3 and 
1,5, as ASTM C133-97 (for uniaxial compressive tests) states. 
Structures were analyzed via SEM as regard to their morphology, 
porosity and connectivity of pores.

3.3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Powder characterization 
 

Figure 3.2 shows the particle size distribution of the commercial 
zirconia powder (as received), while Figure 3.2 shows the same material 
after heat treatments (PS and S) and sieving. The effect of temperature is 
remarkable: NT and PS powders show superposition of the curves, with 
a slight reduction in the “PS” size; S powders showed greater granule 
sizes (&gt; 100 µm) among all tested conditions, probably due to a merge 
of small parts on greater volumes of agglomerates. A de-agglomeration 
process was needed after heat treatment of S powders to break the weak 
bonds between granules, generated by volumetric diffusion triggered by 
high temperature exposure (1500°C). The cumulative curve of the 
Figure 3.3 indicates a small difference between d50 of powders, with 
values around 42 µm for NT and PS powders, and 49 µm for S powders.

The morphology of the three groups can be observed in Figure 
3.4, where the images confirm the mean sizes obtained from the particle 
size analyses. It is possible to observe the spherical shape in all groups 
of powders. The NT powders, however, presented some fractured 
agglomerates explained by the lower cohesive strength of powders in the 
absence of heat treatment. Greater consolidation of particles can be seen 
in PS and S groups, with homogeneous surfaces and less quantity of 
broken agglomerates. The heat treatment can influence the reactivity of 
surface by increasing atomic diffusion, leading to different densities of 
powders, as shown in the (REED, 1995). 

It is important to emphasize the need to maintain the spherical 
morphology of agglomerates throughout the process, ensuring the 
formation of porosity through particle packing (MIAO; SUN, 2009).

Dip coating with different suspensions 
 

Figure 3.5 shows the particle size distributions of the suspensions 
with the different powders. A new peak below 10 µm of particle size 
was identified in NT suspension, meaning that the agglomerates 
undergone fragmentation during mixture of suspension. The distribution 
shifted from unimodal to bimodal. This phenomenon was not verified 
with the PS and S suspension, which underlines the higher cohesion 
reported previously in the SEM inspection of the different powders 
(Figure 3.4).

Figure 3.6 shows zirconia substrates dip coated with the 
different powders (NT, PS and S). It can be seen that NT layer does not 
present macroporosity and spherical particles, as seen in PS and S 
layers. The smeared shape of NT layer is supported by the particle size 
distribution curve plotted in Figure 3.5. Despite the undesired 
morphology, this layer showed good cohesion and adhesion to the 
substrate. On the other hand, layers formed by PS and S powders 
exhibited particles with spherical shape that were homogeneously 
distributed over the substrate, exhibiting the desired configuration of 
particles packing. The higher magnification of the PS layer micrograph, 
however, revealed the presence of small zirconia fragments within the 
spherical particles, working as bridges (necks) that could enhance the 
cohesion of the porous layer. These fragments were most probably 
traced back to the stirring process of the PS powders, which did not 
exhibit the maximum strength, as was the case of the S powders. It must 
be highlighted that no significant necks from solid-state diffusion were 
formed between the PS and S particles, which may compromise the 
mechanical strength of the coatings, due to a lack of consolidation 
between spherical granules of the layer. This lack of cohesion could be 
observed by the particles detachment, especially in the S layer. This fact 
lead us to consider a new approach to increase the mechanical strength 
of the porous layer. Therefore, taking as inspiration the observations 

61



 
 

made in the NT layers, we decided to investigate the addition of fine 
particles (Z3) to the Z40-PS suspensions to simultaneously enhance the 
cohesion of the porous layers and its adhesion to the substrate. The 
particle size distribution of Z3 exhibited an average size of 3 µm (Figure 
3.7). Small particles have the advantage of a greater superficial area, 
when compared to coarser ones, which induces a larger driving force for 
sintering.

(B) and Z40 S (C). 

  
 

Figure 3.6-A shows the particle size distribution of suspensions 
with varied contents of fine particles. The presence of Z3 is evidenced 
by the peaks under 10 µm, which increases with greater contents of fine 
particles in the suspension. The viscosity analysis revealed a 
pseudoplastic behavior of the suspensions. Furthermore, the viscosity 
tended to decrease at a higher amount of Z3 particles. This behavior is in 

62



 

accordance with Moreno (2005) that reported better flow of suspensions 
with wider particle size distributions at higher shear rates.

distribution of Z40 suspensions with the addition of different contents; and (C) 
viscosities as a function of the shear rate of the Z40 suspensions with the 
addition of several contents of Z3 particles. 

 
 

Figure 3.8 shows the micrographs of layers formed with PS 
powder plus different percentages of fine particles (Z3). The addition of 
5% Z3 (Figure 3.8-a) showed no effect at the neck formation. Above 
10% Z3, it is possible to note bonds between two or more Z40 particles, 
spread homogeneously over the layer. As the Z3 content increases it is 
possible to see the greater number of bonds within the particles, without 
significantly impacting the porosity and interconnectivity between the 
pores.

The influence of the addition of the Z3 particles on the cohesion 

of the porous layer was accessed by the wear test previously described, 
which results are plotted in Figure 3.9. It can be seen that the weight loss 
in the 5% Z3 sample was ~10 times higher the weight loss of the 
remaining samples, which highlights the lack of sufficient bonds 
between particles shown in Figure 3.8. The weight loss verified for 
contents above 10% Z3 dropped significantly, which evidences the 
beneficial effect of the Z3 particles as binding agents of the coarser 
particles.

Compression tests on porous solids made by slip casting, using 

the same suspensions of the dip coating process, confirm the tendency to 
increase strength of structures with addition of Z3, as seen in Figure 
3.10. This resulted in the desired increase in the strength of the dip-
coated layer. The specimen with 15% Z3 showed the lowest weight loss 
and, therefore, higher strength of deposited layer among all tested 
conditions. Figure 3.11 shows the top view and a cross-section view 
from the optimized layer of Z40, with thickness around 100 µm.

3.4. CONCLUSIONS 
 

This work aimed at defining a processing route for producing 
surficial macroporous zirconia structures by the dip coating method. The 
following conclusions could be drawn: 

? To produce porous layers by the dip coating method, the 
precursor powder must exhibit adequate cohesion to preserve the 
starting morphology during the whole dip coating process and thus 
allowing the formation of porosity at the particles packing interstices. 

?  A pre-sintering heat treatment of zirconia powders at 1150°C 
was found appropriate to maintain powder’s spherical morphology 
during processing.  

? The unimodal powder distribution, the powder size (Z40; 
~40?m) and the zirconia sintering conditions (1500°C) resulted in the 
formation of weak bonds between the particles that formed the porous 
layer. To solve that, fine particles (Z3) of zirconia powders (~3 µm; 

66



 

15% Z3) were successfully used as binding agent of the coarser 
particles, thus enhancing the cohesion of the particles composing the 
porous layers without affecting the connectivity of porosity.

4. Optimization of porous layers route to obtain porous 
gradient on zirconia substrate by dip coating method 
 
4.1. INTRODUCTION 

 
Zirconia has been expanding its space in advanced ceramic 

applications since the mid-1970’s, when the discovery of toughening 
mechanisms and increasing strength due to a phase transformation came 
to light. The need for the addition of stabilizers to control this 
transformation has opened up a range of new applications, depending on 
predominant structure of zirconia, influenced by the amount and main 
element of the additive. Yttrium oxide added to zirconia structures 
produce materials with superior mechanical properties such as high 
strength and flexibility, enough to compete with titanium alloys, besides 
being considered inert in contact with body, which allows its use as 
orthopedic implants, bone grafts, and dental restorations (DENRY; 
KELLY, 2008).  

Structures of bones and teeth are natural examples of the so called 
functionally graded materials (FGM): the first case, a difference on the 
porosity between surface and core regions improves resistance to 
bending; and in the second case, by the dentin-enamel transition that 
links mechanical resistance of the nucleus (dentin) with chemical 
resistance of the surface (enamel). Natural teeth have the potential to last 
a lifetime, so the current implants try to mimic its structure to increase 
the useful life of specimens by reducing residual stresses from the 
contact between dissimilar materials, which is one of the main causes of 
early fracture (MEHRALI et al., 2013). 

The gradient transition of properties, structures and/or 
compositions are designed to withstand different demands (mechanical, 
chemical, etc.) distributed along a section, and can be drawn to be at 
continuous or discrete format. Continuous transitions exhibit better 
properties although the process is expensive and complex; while discrete 
transition can be produced by deposition of successive layers that 
gradually changes its composition, forming a structure with transition 
bands (MIYAMOTO et al., 1999; UDUPA et al., 2014). The processing 
of layer depositions can vary in price, complexity and reproducibility, 
ranging from CVDs to coatings in general. Among these, the dip coating 
has the advantage of being a simple and low-cost technique, capable to 
cover a wide range of shapes. The deposition occurs by the immersion 
of a substrate in a suspension containing precursor material, which is 
incorporated into the surface via capillary forces. The thickness of the 

69



 
 

layers is controlled by rheological conditions of suspensions and process 
parameters, such as speed and time of immersion (GROSSO, 2011; 
BRINKER, 2013). 

The development of homogeneous or graded porous surfaces on 
biomaterials allows an improvement on osteointegration (as the case of 
cement-free implants) and also creates a favorable environment for the 
functionalization of this structure through impregnation or coating with 
of a second phase. For both applications, the pore size could range from 
50 to 400 µm in order to optimize permeability of the layer and growth 
of natural tissues. Porosity also increases exposed surface area, which is 
convenient on interfaces structures (MIAO; SUN, 2009). 

In this study, we report on the production of zirconia structures 
with surface macroporosity through the dip coating technique. Building 
up mono or multilayers of zirconia suspensions with different powders 
sizes allowed the production of homogeneous and graded macro surface 
porosity over the zirconia substrates. Practical examples as to these 
porosities may be applied are given in the end of the paper. 

 
4.2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 

 

Production of surface homogeneous macroporosity 

 
The base material of this study was a 3% mol yttria-stabilized 

zirconia spray-dried powder (TZ-3YBE, TOSOH Co., Tokyo, Japan). 
This commercial powder, formed by spherical agglomerates with 
average size of 60 µm and green density of 1,1 g/cm³, was used in two 
different forms: pre-sintered powders and as fine particles. The pre-
sintered powders underwent a heat treatment at 1150°C for 1 h for 
consolidation of the starting agglomerates. They were afterwards sieved 
to obtain narrower size distributions, forming three groups of particles 
with average sizes of 40, 70 and 100 µm, hereafter referred as Z40, Z70 
and Z100, respectively (Figure 4.1). The fine powders were obtained 
from a sonication process of the commercial powders for de-
agglomeration, thus resulting in particle sizes of approximately 3 to 10 
µm, hereafter referred as Z3 (Figure 4.1). The F particles did not 
undergo heat treatment. All size distribution analyses were made in 
Mastersizer 2000 (Malvern) equipment.  

Measurements of density were made by analysis of volume of 
powder occupied in a test tube (pycnometry), and its respective mass. It 

70



 

was necessary to vibrate the test tube for 3 minutes, in order to 
accommodate particles compactly.  

 
Figure 4.1 - Particle size distribution of (a) the three groups of “coarse” zirconia 
used as base materials; and (b) fine particles. 

 
 

All ceramic suspensions were prepared with 30 vol.% of solid 
content and 2 m.% of the suspending agent CMC 
(carboxymethylcellulose) (Emfal, Betim, Brazil), in reference to total 
solid mass. The solid contents of the suspensions were composed by a 
mixture of coarse and fine powders: Z40-15% Z3, Z70-25%Z3 and 
Z100-25%Z3 (relation to volume). The fine particles contents in the 
different suspensions were determined based on previous experiments.  

The dip coating was made over uniaxially pressed commercial 
zirconia discs (150 MPa), non-sintered, with 20 mm of diameter and 2 
mm height. The layers build up on zirconia substrates followed the next 
sequence: discs were first dipped into Z3 suspension to form a thin 
adhesive layer between the substrate and the upper coarse powder layer. 
The first dipped layer of Z3 powders dried in air before receiving the 
next layer of coarser particles. During experimental work, it was found 
the need to perform in multilayered specimens intermediate heat 
treatments to the freshly deposited layers in order to avoid the layers 
leaching to the suspension. Three treatments were tested: air drying, 
muffle kiln and pre-sintering (1150°C), with the latter being the most 
efficient in maintaining the layers morphology.  Therefore, specimens 
with homogeneous surface porosity were produced with one, two and 
three dips (in the same suspension), passing through a pre-sintering 
treatment between each dip (Appendix A). 

After the build-up of the last layer, the specimens were air-dried 
and air sintered in a conventional furnace at 1500°C for 2h. Scanning 
electron microscopy (SEM) (TM3030, Hitachi, Japan) was used to 

71



 
 

analyze the microstructure of the different specimens. Specimens were 
gold coated prior to SEM inspection. 

 
Production of surface graded macroporosity 

 

To produce the gradient of macroporosity at the surface of 
zirconia discs, a sequence of layers was deposited, following the same 
steps mentioned above for the production of homogeneous porosity: a 
layer of Z3 particles is first deposited followed by a sequential 
deposition of smaller to bigger powders, using Z40, Z70 and Z100 
suspensions, respectively. Two conditions were tested: a single 
sequential dip in each suspension (Z40 + Z70 + Z100), condition 
referred as Grad SD; and double sequential dip in each suspension 
(2xZ40 + 2xZ70 + 2xZ100), referred as Grad DD. It must be referred 
that both Grad SD and Grad DD specimens underwent a preliminary dip 
of Z3 prior to coarse powders layers, similarly to the above described 
for specimens with homogenous porosity. The specimens were finally 
air sintered at 1500°C for 2h. 

 
Porous solids by slip casting 

 
In order to characterize the mechanical properties of the porous 

layers tested in this study, porous solids with cylindrical shape were 
produced from the same suspensions used to produce the porous 
coatings in the zirconia discs, using the slip casting technique (Appendix 
B).  Despite they are different techniques, slip casting was found to have 
high similitude to dip coating, thus allowing to produce porous solids 
with properties close to the layers produced over the zirconia substrates. 
Hence, several cylindrical porous solids were produced using a polymer 
mold (13 mm of diameter and 30 mm height) with an absorbent base 
attached. Suspensions with coarse powders (Z40, Z70 and Z100) and 
varying Z3 contents (20, 30, 40 and 50vol%) were tested.  Suspensions 
were poured into the mold, drained by the absorbent base, and dried in a 
stove for 48 h. The specimens showed different height, but the h/D 
relation remains between 0.3 and 1.5 according to ASTM C133-97 (for 
compressive tests). The specimens were polished to ensure parallelism 
between faces, and then, sintered at 1500°C/2h. Structures were 
analyzed via SEM as regard to their morphology, porosity and 
connectivity of pores. 

The apparent porosity was measured using ASTM C20-00, by 
weighing of the specimens under three conditions: D – dry; I – 

72



 

immersed in water; and W – wet (saturated with water, removed drops 
from the surface). The apparent porosity (%) expresses the volumetric 
relation of open pores to external volume. Apparent density (g/cm³) 
represents the quotient of the dry weight divided by the total volume, 
including pores. All calculations consider water density as 1 g/cm³, and 
sintered zirconia (theoretical) as 6.05 g/cm³.

Mechanical characterization 

 
The fracture strength of coated specimens was obtained from a 

ball-on-three-balls test (B3B) performed in a universal testing machine 
(Instron 8874, MA, USA), especially used for testing disc shaped 
specimens of britlle materials. The specimens were loaded under a 
crosshead speed of 0.15 mm/s until its rupture, using a load cell of 25 
kN. The strength is the force applied at the first “break” of the specimen 
(ZIELKE et al, 2016). 

The fracture surfaces were then inspected by SEM in order to 
assess the influence of the biaxial test on the fracture pattern and 
integrity of the porous coatings.  

The mechanical properties of the porous coatings were estimated 
by the assessment of the compressive strength of porous solids produced 
by slip casting. Tests were conducted in a universal testing machine 
(Emic DL 2000) with load cell TRD 27 (200 kN) and loading speed of 
0.5 mm/min.  
 
 
4.3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 

Characterization of homogeneous macroporous layers 

 
The comparison of morphologies of treated (pre-sintered) and 

untreated Z100 powders can be seen in Figure 4.2. Treated powders 
(PS) exhibit consolidated surfaces with higher cohesion than the non-
treated (NT), evidenced by the spherical shape and the absence of 
fractured agglomerates. This allows the agglomerates to keep its original 
shape during the stirring processes associated to the preparation of 

73



 
 

suspensions for the dip coating process. The heat treatment imparts to 
the powders a slight increase in density (~20%) relative to non-treated 
ones: 1.20 g.cm-³ for non-treated (NT) powders and 1.47 g.cm-³ for pre-
sintered (PS) powders.  

In the previous chapter, addition of fine powders to the coarser 
powders suspensions was necessary for increasing cohesion of the 
macroporous layers deposited over zirconia substrates.  

Figure 4.3 compares morphologies of two Z40 layers (a) with no 
addition of Z3 particles, and (b) with addition of 15% (vol.%) of Z3 
particles. It is clearly seen the beneficial effect of the fine particles in 
terms of setting bonds between the coarser particles without 
significantly compromising the interconnectivity between them. The 
relation of fine particle (Z3) to coarse particles (Z40) content have been 
previously optimized (in the previous chapter) as regard to the layer’s 
morphologies with varying Z3 contents, porosity and compressive 
strength of “layers” (porous solids with similar compositions).

suspensions: a) no addition of fine particles (Z3) to Z40 suspension; b) addition 
of 15% Z3 to the Z40 suspension. 

 
 
As stated before, the porous solids structures made by slip casting 

may differ in some extent to the layers deposited by dip coating. 
Nevertheless, due to the similar packing arrangement of both processes, 
this process was selected for producing the porous solids that allowed 
estimating the porosity and compressive strength of the dip coated 
layers. The porous solids revealed a decreasing trend of porosity for 
increasing contents of Z3 particles in the suspensions, regardless of the 
coarse powder size (Z40, Z70 or Z100), as depicted in Figure 4.4 and 
further evidenced in density measurements presented in Table 4.1. 

Density values follow the opposite trend, with higher contents of 
Z3 particles producing denser solids. Coarser powders combined with 
Z3 particles show higher densities results in improved packing 
efficiency – a greater difference on the diameters of the components 
influences negatively in the point of view of forming porosity, as 
Oliveira’s graphs indicates (OLIVEIRA et al., 2000) due to a more 
compact packing arrangement. Additionally, higher densities impart 
greater mechanical strength and stiffness to porous solids since porosity 
is regarded reducing the Young’s modulus of the system.

Figure 4.5 shows the compressive strength of the porous solids 

made of different powder sizes (Z40, Z70 and Z100) as a function of the 
fine particles (Z3) contents in the suspensions. It can be seen that 
strength increases with the increasing content of Z3 particles and that 
this effect was more pronounced for particles of bigger size.  

Figure 4.6 shows the single- and double-dipped zirconia 
substrates with Z40, Z70 and Z100 powders. It can be clearly seen from 
the image the effect of particle size as well as the number of dips. A 
single-dip was not able to cover the edges of the substrate regardless the 
size of the powder. When two dips were performed, the Z40 and Z70 
suspensions a full coverage of the edges of the specimens was achieved. 
The same effect was only obtained for Z100 specimens after the third 
dip coating.

of the respective system (column), with the focus of showing the connections 
between coarser particles. 

 
 

As the number of dips increases, it becomes more difficult to 
control thickness due to excessive formation of bubbles on the surface in 
some substrates. Two possible causes can be advanced: insufficient time 
for the liquid to penetrate the surface porosity, and the viscosity of the 
suspension, which can also affect the time required to complete 

77



 
 

“absorption” of the liquid. High viscosity can also form thick droplets, 
especially at the edges, causing heterogeneities in the layers. 
Immediately drying of the substrate after its withdraw from suspension 
may avoid gross marks on the deposited surface, but it does not 
eliminate the formation of irregularities. 

Figure 4.7 shows SEM micrographs of the cross section view of 
different specimens produced in this study. The thickness of each 
specimen is marked with dashed line for guidance of the reader, as the 
depth effect resulting from specimens tilting during observation may be 
misleading regarding the real thickness value. The thicknesses values 
measured on different specimens were recorded and exhibited in Figure 
4.8. The coating thickness was found to vary linearly with the number of 
dips for all the powder sizes. Comparing the three systems, the single-
dip Z40 layer exhibited the best particle packing, since its average 
thickness was equivalent to overlap 2.7 particles of Z40, higher than 
Z70 and Z100 layers, with average thicknesses similar to 1.6 
“overlapped” particles (considering respective mean size of each 
system).

Biaxial strength tests 

 
Dip coated specimens were subjected to biaxial strength tests 

(B3B) to assess the influence of the macroporous coatings on the 
flexural strength of the zirconia substrates. Figure 4.9 shows the results 
obtained from the B3B test of the coated specimens, as well as of the 
uncoated specimens for reference. It can be seen that, regardless of the 
type of coating, the fracture loadings of coated specimens were above 
the results obtained for the uncoated specimens, taken as the “control 
group” (1500 ± 190 N), mean value indicated by the dashed line and the 
gray area represents the standard deviation. This means that the presence 
of macroporous coatings did not induce a detrimental effect on the 
fracture resistance of the zirconia specimens, as could be initially 
supposed based on the higher surface roughness imparted by porous 
coatings. The results obtained from static load to fracture tests may 
therefore present a different trend under fatigue conditions. Therefore, 
further studies should be conducted to suitably address this issue.

specimens with single-dip coating, and Z70 double-dipped specimen, 
with an arrow indicating the loading point at the compressive surface. 
The compressive curls are well evidenced at this adjacent region. 
Delamination occurrences of the porous layers were seen in specimens 
subjected to the flexural test (B3B), with thicker layers being more 
prone to this phenomenon. Hence, single-dipped specimens showed few 
or no delamination of layers; whereas specimens with double and triple 
dipped layers exhibited greater occurrences.

indicates the fracture origin at the tensile surface of the specimen.

groups as seen in Table 4.2. However, thicker coatings and bigger 
particles presented higher delamination incidence.

Characterization of graded macroporous layers 

 

Figure 4.12 shows the cross-section view of layers deposited by 
the consecutive immersion in suspensions with Z40, Z70 and Z100 
powders. In Figure 4.12-A, the graded porous layer was obtained by a 
single dip in each suspension (Z40 + Z70 + Z100), making a total of 
three dips. In Figure 4.12-B, the graded porous layer was produced by 
dipping twice in each suspension (2xZ40 + 2xZ70 + 2xZ100), making a 
total of 6 dips. The thickness is the main difference among the 
structures: Grad SD with average values around 300 ± 50 µm, and Grad 
DD around 660 ± 240 µm. The detailed view of the graded coating 
profiles is seen in Figure 4.12 from the high magnification micrographs, 
where the dash lines indicate the average bands of each zirconia 
powders.  

Table 4.3 presents the fracture load values obtained for Grad SD 
and Grad DD specimens (n ~ 10). The fracture load of both specimens 
remained within the same range of the values obtained for specimens 
with homogeneous porous layers (increase ~20%), which means that the 
thickness of layers and the number of dips did not seem to compromise 
the static fracture resistance. Nevertheless, the same concerns regarding 
the fatigue behavior mentioned above for specimens with homogeneous 
porous layers, also applies for Grad SD and Grad DD specimens.

The occurrence of delamination was also verified in the case of 
gradient layers, as shown in Figure 4.13. All Grad DD samples 
presented delaminated layers after test, while only 25% of Grad SD 
samples showed this phenomenon, exhibiting the same trend previously 
seen for specimens with homogeneous porous coatings.

4.4. CONCLUSIONS 
 

This work aimed to produce and characterize homogeneous and 
graded macroporous zirconia layers over zirconia substrates by the dip 
coating technique. The following conclusions could be drawn: 

? Homogeneous and graded macroporous layers were 
successfully built over zirconia substrates using suspensions with 
powders of different sizes (Z40, Z70, Z100 and fine particle (Z3)), using 
the dip coating technique. 

? The thickness of the porous layer increased with the increasing 
number of dips, regardless the size of the powder (Z40, Z70, Z100). 

84



 

? The fracture strength of the specimens with homogeneous and 
graded macroporous layers was higher than that of uncoated specimens 
(~20%), meaning that coatings were not detrimental for the static 
strength of the porous specimens. 

? The flexural tests imparted delamination occurrences in the 
porous layer of some specimens, with the higher incidence being 
observed for coatings with larger thicknesses and bigger 
particles/granules.

5. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS &amp;amp; SUGGESTIONS 
 
5.1. CONCLUSIONS 

 
The investigation on the route of fabrication of surface porous 

layers of zirconia presented as main conclusions: 
? The powders must remain spherical throughout the processing 

in order to generate the expected interstices. For this, heat treatment of 
the starting material is required;  

? A better cohesion of the layer is achieved by adding fine 
particles to the system, acting as binder agent for coarser particles;  

? A “pre-deposition” of fine particles (&lt;10 µm) on the substrate is 
necessary for improved adhesion among substrate and successive layers; 

? Homogeneous and graded layers were feasible to be produced 
by successive depositions over the substrate, although studies related to 
the drying and heat treatment between depositions should be further 
investigated;  

? Fracture strength of both layers, homogeneous and graded, were 
higher than uncoated substrates; 

? Flexural tests evidence delaminations of the porous layers in 
some specimens, increasing incidence on larger thickness layers. 

 
 

5.2. SUGGESTIONS 
 

During this study, some points of the process indicate the need of 
improvement, suggesting that future works should study: 

? An investigation on the effect of drying on the layers, 
considering multiple depositions, in order to avoid delaminations and 
drying defects; 

? Estimate residual stresses of porous solids (slip casting)  after 
burn-out by dilatometry; 

? A study of the impregnation with porcelain and/or bioglass on 
graded and homogeneous layers structures for biomedical applications; 

? A study of interconnectivity of pores, on layer, and a complex 
analysis of the thickness to obtain a ; 

? Mechanical characterization of the samples (both homogeneous 
and graded porous layers) under humidity and cyclic loadings for 
biomedical applications; 

? Characterization for biomedical applications: in vitro and in 
vivo.

APPENDIX A - Heat treatment on the interval of depositions 
 

The observation, during the first tests, of the thicknesses of the 
layers produced with more than one immersion led us to believe that the 
loss of deposited material could be occurring during subsequent 
immersions; in other words, a layer formed by double dip, would not 
have necessarily twice the thickness of a layer formed by a single dip. 
For this reason, an evaluation of the best procedure between immersions 
was made to avoid loss of the first deposited material during the 
subsequent immersion. 

It was analyzed that double-dip layer, formed by Z40 followed by 
Z70, would make it possible to visualize the “row” of different particle 
sizes, and the total thickness of the final layer. Between the dips, three 
steps were tested: 1 - air flow (drying by air), 2 - pre-sintering (1150ºC) 
and 3 - sintering (1500ºC). Figure A.1 shows the formed layers, with the 
average final thickness indicated on each case.  

Although there was no substantial difference on the thickness of 
tested conditions, the images show a higher value to the "pre-sinter" 
amid layers condition, which indicates a lower material loss during 
subsequent immersion than the “air dryer” condition. The sintering step 
among immersions could induce a great reduction of the sphere sizes, 
leading to crack the layers. In this way, it was decided to “pre-sintering” 
the samples on every interval of subsequent deposition.  
 
Figure A.1 - Effect of heat treatment on the final thickness of layers form by 
two immersions: Z40 followed by Z70: (a) air dryer, (b) 1150°C (no plateau), 
and (c) 1500°C (no plateau).

APPENDIX B - Porous solids 
 

The idea of production of porous solids emerged to estimate 
values of porosity and resistance of the layers produced by dip coating, 
once there was no way to evaluate those properties in such a thin part. 
As discussed along the work, the morphology of these solids were not 
equivalent to the deposited layers via dip coating, as seen in the images 
below. Despite morphologic differences, the mechanism used to form 
those solids is basically the same used on dip coating, in a way that 
particles are conformed almost in absence of external forces, what 
enables an approximation of properties of both materials (made by slip 
casting and dip coating). 

Most specimens showed good distribution between fine and 
coarse particles, but some of them presented spots of agglomerate fine 
particles. The increase of Z3 amount was not evidenced in all images of 
porous solids; the heterogeneity of the specimens does not allowed a 
pattern of morphology in different situations. In the comparison between 
porous solids (slip casting) and deposited layers under the same 
condition (amount of Z3), the “binder mass” was more visible in the 
first case, possibly due to a gathering of particles near external faces, 
formed during drying.

Z3 (right).

25% Z3.

APPENDIX C - Delamination and defects on deposited layers 
 

 Several defects occurred during experiments. The first trace of 
delamination appeared after pre-sintering of a single-dipped specimen, 
with a detached layer that indicates drying issues. From this evidence, 
the pieces began to pass through air-drying before undergoing pre-
sintering (or sintering) step. After B3B bending tests, this problem was 
again evidenced with a slight difference: the detachment occurs between 
layers, not between layer and substrate as seen it before. Figure C.1 (left) 
shows part of the layer adhered to the substrate, illustrating the 
described situation on a double-dipped Z40 layer; the right image also 
contains parts of an adhered layer, near the fracture surface. The thicker 
the layer, the higher frequency of delaminations was observed, 
suggesting a possible relation of the defects with the successive 
exposure to thermal treatments (among dips). 
 
Figure C.1 - Example of delamination of the double-dipped Z40 layer, after 
flexural test. Left: cross-section view. Right: top view of the fracture surface. 

 
 

Bubbles and thickness variations were also common defects 
along experiments, both observed in Figure C.1 (right). The emergence 
of bubbles is associated with the suspensions conditions: the tendency of 
suspensions to become more viscous as reused after a few days, due to 
loss of water, favored bubble’s formation. 

In some layers produced with larger particles, Z70 and Z100, 
small islands of fine material were formed, as can be seen Figure C.2. 
To avoid such heterogeneity, constant stirring of suspensions was 
required in the immersion intervals.

coverage of the substrate. Up: Z70 - 1 dip; down: Z100 - 1 dip. 

 
 

The presence of hollow spheres did not prove to be a problem in 
the processing, nor in the porosity, but it was observed with great 
frequency in the analysis of the layers, being a defect coming from the 
manufacturer.
