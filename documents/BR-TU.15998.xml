ABSTRACT 

 

SILVA, L. P. da. Analysis of hydraulic properties and 3D images of some tropical soils.

Paulo, Piracicaba, 2017. 

 

Mass and energy flow processes in soil are strongly dependent on the state of the soil structure 

and on pore space geometry. To correctly describe these transport processes, an adequate pore 

space characterization is required. In this context, the use of computerized microtomography 

allows the visualization of the soil structures and processes that occur at large scales may be 

very useful, besides being a fast and non-destructive technique. Soil hydraulic properties, which 

are essential in the quantification of water balance components in hydrological models of the 

unsaturated zone, can be measured directly with field or laboratory methods. Simultaneous 

determination of these properties can be done by the Wind-Schindler evaporation method, but 

determining only the retention function is a more common practice. The relation between soil 

water retention and hydraulic conductivity can then be predicted using theories like those 

developed by Childs and Collis-George, Burdine and Mualem. These models treat pore-space 

tortuosity and connectivity as an empirical parameter, and its value remains usually 

undetermined, the use of a standard value being more common. Based on this contextualization, 

the objectives of this thesis are: (i) to evaluate the correlation between soil hydraulic properties 

measured in the laboratory, and parameters that quantify soil pore space from 3D images 

obtained by X-ray microtomography; and (ii) to functionally analyze soil hydraulic property 

parameterization in the prediction of soil water balance components by an agrohydrological 

model. To verify the relationship between soil hydraulic properties and soil image parameters, 

a stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed between the pore space parameters from 

images and empirical parameters of the semi-deterministic model, obtained with evaporation 

experiments together with an inverse solution method. Functional evaluation of soil hydraulic 

parameters was performed by a sensitivity analysis of the outputs of an agro-hydrological model 

to several ways of obtaining the tortuosity/connectivity parameter: applying the commonly used 

standard value, or determining its value in evaporation experiments in the laboratory with wet-

range tensiometers, dry-range tensiometers, or both wet- and dry-range tensiometers. 

Simulations with the agro-hydrological model were performed for some years with distinct 

rainfall characteristics. The soil retention curve obtained using soil images had a good 



10 

agreement to the retention curve obtained by the evaporation experiment, although the spatial 

resolution of the microtomograph allowed to only quantify macropores, consequently, to 

determine the hydraulic properties in a small range close to saturation. Soil hydraulic 

parameterization using a wide range of pressure heads is recommended for a better 

representation of vadose zone processes and soil-water-plant relations.

Os processos de fluxo de massa e energia no solo dependem fortemente do estado da estrutura 

do solo e da geometria do espaço dos poros. Para descrever corretamente esses processos de 

transporte, é necessária uma caracterização adequada do espaço poroso. Neste contexto, o uso 

da microtomografia computadorizada permite a visualização das estruturas do solo e os 

processos que ocorrem em grandes escalas podem ser muito úteis, além de ser uma técnica 

rápida e não destrutiva. As propriedades hidráulicas do solo, que são essenciais na quantificação 

dos componentes do balanço hídrico em modelos hidrológicos da zona não saturada, podem ser 

medidas diretamente com métodos de campo ou laboratório. A determinação simultânea dessas 

propriedades pode ser feita pelo método de evaporação Wind-Schindler, mas a determinação 

apenas da função de retenção é uma prática mais comum. A relação entre a retenção de água 

do solo e a condutividade hidráulica pode então ser predita por teorias como as desenvolvidas 

por Childs e Collis-George, Burdine e Mualem. Esses modelos tratam a tortuosidade e 

conectividade do espaço poroso como um parâmetro empírico, e seu valor permanece 

geralmente indeterminado, sendo o uso de um valor padrão mais comum. Com base nessa 

contextualização, os objetivos desta tese são: (i) avaliação da correlação entre propriedades 

hidráulicas do solo, medidas em laboratório e parâmetros que quantificam o espaço de poros 

do solo a partir de imagens 3D obtidas por microtomografia de raios X; (ii) a análise funcional 

da parametrização das propriedades hidráulicas do solo na predição dos componentes do 

balanço hídrico do solo por um modelo agro-hidrológico. Para a verificação da relação entre as 

propriedades hidráulicas do solo e os parâmetros da imagem do solo, foi realizada uma análise 

de regressão múltipla entre os parâmetros do espaço poroso por imagens e parâmetros empíricos 

do modelo semi-determinística, obtidos com experimentos de evaporação juntamente com 

método de solução inversa. A avaliação funcional das parametrizações hidráulicas do solo foi 

feita pela análise de a sensibilidade das saídas de um modelo agro-hidrológico a várias maneiras 

de obter o parâmetro de tortuosidade/conectividade: aplicando um valor fixo comumente 

utilizado ou determinando seu valor em experimentos de evaporação no laboratório com 

tensiômetros na faixa úmida, tensiômetros na faixa seca, ou com tensiômetros nas faixas seca e 



12 

úmida. As simulações com o modelo agro-hidrológico foram realizadas por vários anos com 

disponibilidade de água distinta. A curva de retenção de solo obtida através de imagens do solo 

está em concordância com a curva de retenção obtida pelo experimento de evaporação, embora 

a limitação da resolução espacial da microtomografia, permitiu apenas quantificar macroporos, 

consequentemente, a determinação das propriedades hidráulicas em uma pequena faixa 

próxima à saturação. A parametrização hidráulica do solo usando uma faixa mais ampla de 

tensões é recomendada para melhor representar os processos na zona não-saturada e das 

relações solo-água-planta.

1 INTRODUCTION 

 

Prediction of soil water state and movement of water in the soil is one of the most 

subjects studied in soil physics. The importance of this theme is attached to processes related 

to availability of water to plants, transport of solutes in the soil, irrigation and drainage 

management, soil and water conservation, among others. Besides these, there is the direct 

influence of the state and soil water balance on its thermal and gaseous regime. Knowledge of 

soil water properties (retention and water conductivity) is essential for any modeling in 

hydrology, meteorology and plant production, since these properties are key elements in the 

fundamental equations involved and, therefore, in the quantification of forecasts soil water 

flow. 

Soil water retention and soil hydraulic conductivity express, respectively, the 

relationship between storage and energetic state of water, and the easiness with which water is 

conducted through the soil. Several factors interfere in soil retention capacity, one of those 

factor is the grain size distribution, since it defines the area of contact between solid particles 

and water and determines the pore size distribution. Another important factor in water retention 

is the soil structure, as it characterizes the arrangement of the particles and, consequently, the 

pore space geometry.  

In order to characterize the soil water retention, the water content and its specific or 

potential energy are correlated; this functional relationship is usually called retention curve and 

can be correlated with the soil pore diameter distribution. The relationship between the soil 

hydraulic conductivity and its water content or potential, in turn, is determined by the geometry 

and continuity of its pores filled with water, thus becoming dependent on its shape, quantity, 

distribution and continuity. Indirect methods to obtain saturated hydraulic conductivity may 

presume mathematical relationships and correlations between the saturated hydraulic 

conductivity, Ks, and other non-hydraulic soil variables, such as soil density, total porosity, 

macro and microporosity, which influence the distribution of the pores and, consequently, the 

permeability of soils. 

Among the methods to determine the soil hydraulic conductivity in function of water 

content or matric potential, there are field methods (instant profile, impermeable layers), 

laboratory (internal drainage, hot air, evaporation) and empirical methods, based on pores 

diameters distribution.  

  



20 

Evaporation method, also called Wind method in homage to its proposer (WIND, 1968), 

is a laboratory method that is based on the water evaporation of a sample, allowing to 

simultaneously determine the retention curve, h (?), and hydraulic conductivity as a function of 

water content or matric potential, K (?, h). The determination is carried out under controlled 

measurement conditions and presents good performance, even in soils with low hydraulic 

conductivity. It consists of subjecting an initially saturated soil cylinder to a progressive drying 

during which it is analyzed: (i) the temporal variation of soil mass m(t) in the cylinder to 

determine the rate of water loss by evaporation and (ii) The evolution of the matrix potential 

values h (z, t) of the water in the soil, in some vertical positions in the sample as a function of 

time. For mass determination, the experimental set is placed on a self-registering scale. The 

potential of water is usually monitored with microtensiometers. 

Wind methods advantages are: (i) in any measurement time, only mean water content 

of the sample needs to be determinate; (ii) the curves h(?) and K(?, h) can be estimated 

simultaneously; and (iii) as discrete values of water content and hydraulic conductivity are 

calculated, it is not necessary to infer about an adjustment mathematical model of water 

relations 

In addition to experimental techniques involving water movement itself, unsaturated 

soil hydraulic conductivity can also be predicted from the geometry of the porous system 

(CHILDS; COLLIS-GEORGE, 1950; BURDINE, 1953; MUALEM, 1976) with the use of 

water retention curve (BROOKS; COREY, 1964; MUALEM, 1976; van GENUCHTEN, 

1980). 

Alternatively, to the direct conductivity determination methods described above, the 

pore space may also be characterized by tomography. This characterization may allow an 

estimation of the hydraulic conductivity. The microtomography (X-ray) or ?-ray 

microtomography is a non-destructive technique that can be efficiently used in studies related 

to soil structure. It allows cross sections visualization of samples interior without having to cut 

them or make any other type of invasion. The ?TC technique uses the principle of radiation 

attenuation in media material, being the basic idea the image reconstruction of a section of the 

sample, through its projections in several directions. These projections are obtained by 

sweeping the sample with a radiation beam and measuring its attenuation. A matrix of data is 

thus formed which is processed in a personal computer, obtaining the image in the beam plane 

section. 

  



21 

X-ray tomography has been used in the field of soil science since the early 1980s, and 

presents several advantages for pore space characterization: it allows a relatively quick 

measurement acquisition; it is non-destructive; and the resolution can reach micron scale or 

less. An increasing number of publications refers to this technique, along with new algorithms 

to enhance analyses and perform original measurements, such as pore size distribution, shape, 

connectivity or orientation. Soil processes can be simulated in a 3D porous space using dynamic 

models and X-ray computed tomography images; examples include water flow, predict soil 

hydraulic conductivity, fungal colonization in the pore space or organic matter decomposition.  

The objectives of work were (i) evaluation of the correlation between soil hydraulic 

properties, measured in the laboratory, and images parameters that quantifies soil pore space 

through 3D images obtained by X-ray microtomography; and (ii) adequacy analysis of soil 

hydraulic properties parameterization in the prediction of soil hydraulic processes and identify 

the effect on agrohydrological simulations.

2 SOIL HYDRAULIC PARAMETERS AND 3D IMAGES ANALYSIS OF 

TROPICAL SOILS 

Abstract 

Transport processes of compounds in the soil are related and strongly dependent on pore space 

structure and geometry. A better description and comprehension of transport processes in soils 

requires a better characterization at the pore scale. It is common practice to determine hydraulic 

properties (conductivity and retentivity) in lab experiments that are labor intensive and time 

consuming. X-ray computerized microtomography is a fast and non-destructive technique that 

allows visualization of soil structures, offering a potential tool for understanding soil structure 

and its relation to transport properties. Coupling soil hydraulic property measurements and X-

ray CT, we evaluated the correlation between soil hydraulic properties measured in undisturbed 

samples using evaporation experiments and 3D X-ray microtomography image properties; a 

stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed that allows to predict hydraulic parameters 

from image parameters.   

Keywords: connectivity, pores, ImageJ 

2.1 Introduction 

Soil structure is considered a main attribute determining soil quality and its qualitative 

role in soil hydrology is well documented on the pedologic scale. Soil macro- and 

micromorphology is intrinsically related to soil structure given by pore space and spatial 

distribution, being considered as the basis for explaining the influence of soil structure on 

hydraulic functions (KUTÍLEK, 2004) as well as on mechanical characteristics (VOGEL; 

WELLER; SCHLÜTER, 2010). 

Natural soils are porous media containing complex structures at several length scales. 

The micro-scale, also referred to as the pore-scale, is the scale at which individual grains and 

fluid interfaces can be resolved and identified and at which many physical and chemical 

phenomena are rooted. Larger-scale processes are often governed by these small-scale 

phenomena (WILDENSCHILD; SHEPPARD, 2013). The flow of water through soil is 

controlled by the size, shape and connection of pores, which is in turn controlled by the size 

and packing of soil particles. 

  



24 

For soil water dynamic properties, pore system continuity is often more important than 

pore diameters (BERALDO; SCANNAVINO JUNIOR; CRUVINEL, 2014). Bouma (1982) 

highlighted the importance of pore continuity for the flow of water and solutes in the soil, 

emphasizing that small pores often enhance soil hydraulic conductivity since they form a 

continuous network, while large pores cannot contribute to flow in the case of discontinuity.  

Traditionally, porosity is characterized using soil bulk density and water retention data 

(EVERTS; KANWAR, 1992). Whereas these measurements are an indirect measure of pore 

size distributions or porosity, they do not include any information on the spatial distribution of 

the pores, on the nature of the pore space or on pore connectivity and continuity (GANTZER; 

ANDERSON, 2002). More insight in soil pore space can be obtained by measuring hydraulic 

conductivity, both saturated and unsaturated. The relation between hydraulic conductivity and 

water content or pressure head allows to infer about pore connectivity and continuity, by the 

introduction of an empirical parameter to account for eccentricity of the flow path (CHILDS; 

COLLIS-GEORGE, 1950; BURDINE, 1953; MUALEM, 1976).  

Among the water-based methods for determination of soil hydraulic properties, the 

Wind (1968) evaporation method is a frequently employed one (ŠIM?NEK; WENDROTH; 

VAN GENUCHTEN, 1998; SCHINDLER; MÜLLER, 2006; PETERS; DURNER, 2008; 

PINHEIRO; VAN LIER; METSELAAR, 2017). It is a laboratory method based on the 

evaporation of water from a soil sample, allowing the simultaneous determination of the 

retention curve h(?) and the hydraulic conductivity property K(?,h) during the natural 

desiccation of the soil. The calculation procedure evolved from a manually assisted iterative 

routine (WIND, 1968) to modern inverse modeling techniques (ŠIM?NEK; WENDROTH; 

VAN GENUCHTEN, 1998; SCHNEIDER et al., 2006).  

Besides the indirect water-based measurement of pore geometry characteristics, the 

characterization of soil pore space can also be achieved by the direct observation of pores and 

features using microscopic thin-section 1D techniques or by X-ray or gamma ray 

microtomography yielding 2D or 3D images. These techniques allow to visualize the pores 

within the technically possible resolution of each method and equipment used. Through 3D 

images, it is possible to observe the geometry and spatial arrangement, enabling to visualize 

and quantify pore connectivity and continuity.  

The computer-assisted quantification of pore size distribution from soil images may be 

useful to improve understanding of macroporosity and how it relates to tension and hydraulic 

conductivity. The pore size distribution derived from microtomography may allow to better 

describe near-saturated hydraulic properties (BECKERS et al., 2014), as an accurate description 



25 

of the retention curve in the wet range is a challenge due to difficulties in determining precisely 

soil water content at lower pressure heads near saturation (VEREECKEN et al., 2010). These 

authors also pointed out the drawbacks of exact measurements in the change of water content 

at low pressure heads.  

Traditional methods for the determination of hydraulic properties are often limited to 

relatively narrow ranges of water content. On the other hand, microtomography technique 

allows a relatively quick measurement acquisition; it is a non-destructive technique, providing 

a detailed view into the physical structure of undisturbed soil at a spatial resolution of a few 

microns. It is very promising due to its versatility, being applied in several areas, specifically 

in soil science for the representation and morphological quantification of porous space. The 

joint use of hydraulic properties and visual quantification of pore space may be helpful for a 

better parameterization and understanding of soil properties and behavior. Therefore, in order 

to verify the relation between soil hydraulic properties and soil image parameters that describe 

the pore space, we analyzed soil images using microtomography as well as traditional water-

based determination techniques.

(0.10 – 0.30 m depth) of four soils from São Paulo State, Brazil: a Rhodic Ferralsol (coordinates 

23º 06’ 17” S; 46º 56’ 01” W), a Rhodic Lixisol (23º 06’ 32” S; 46º 55’ 54” W), a Xanthic 

Ferrasol (22º 42’ 51” S; 47º 37’ 02” W), and a Rhodic Nitossol (22° 42’ 02” S; 

47° 37’ 22” W). Undisturbed samples were collected in PVC cylinders (12 samples, 7.5 cm 

diameter, 7.5 cm high) for CT analysis as well as in metal rings (64 samples, 5 cm diameter,  

3 cm high) for water-based analyses. The samples were stored under refrigeration at field-moist 

condition (i.e. not air dry to avoid structural changes due to shrinkage) and without mechanical 

disturbance. Soil-particle density was determined by pycnometry using disturbed samples. 

Results are summarized in Table 2.1.

2.2.2 X-ray CT scanning 

Samples taken in the PVC rings were submitted to image acquisition with a CT system 

Nikon XT H 225, with the following technical specifications: dual reflection-transmission 

target system including a 225 kV, 225 W high performance X-ray source, equipped with a 

reflection target with pot size of 3 µm combined with a nano-focus transmission module, spot 

size of 1 µm.  

The images were acquired in two steps, using copper filters to minimize artifacts; filter 

thickness was dependent on the soil type. The first step comprised the imaging of the entire 

sample at low spatial resolution (pixel size 40 µm, energy settings 150 kV and 280 – 419 ?A). 

The second step aimed to acquire the image of a region of interest inside the sample,  

scanning at high spatial resolution (pixel size of 12 µm, energy settings 115 – 190 kV and  

80 – 288 ?A), allowing an improved visualization of smaller pores.  

After the image acquisition, median filters were applied before reconstruction in order 

to reduce random noise from the detector. Median filters consist of a nonlinear smoothing 

method used to reduce isolated noise without blurring sharp edges (LEE et al., 2013). 

Reconstruction was done with the software CT Pro 3D (Nikon) and saved in raw format (tiff) 

and 8-bit gray scale resolution. 



27 

2.2.3 Image Processing  

Image processing was performed with the image analysis software FIJI/Image J 

(SCHINDELIN et al., 2012). Initially, the images were submitted to the preprocessing step in 

which covering denoising, edge enhancement, artifact removal and intensity bias correction 

were applied over the images. The adaptive filter (OLLION et al., 2013) available in ImageJ 

was used for noise removal.  

The segmentation process provides a way to separate the object of interest from the 

background, in this case, the pore space from the soil matrix. This step was performed using 

the ImageJ thresholding tool (automated segmentation) which applies the local thresholding 

method combined with Histogram analysis. The local thresholding values are determined in a 

local environment (often defined by the radius of a circular neighborhood) and the local cut-off 

values are locally applied to the individual pixels of the image. Thus, darker areas in an image 

might be extractable comparably as well as very bright areas, but this would not be possible 

with a global threshold only, where specifically very dark areas shift into the background or 

might be under-extracted. More information about segmentation methods can be found in 

Iassonov, Gebrenegus and Tuller (2009). 

After the segmentation process, morphological operations of erosion-dilation were 

applied into binary images. Erosion-dilation is a mathematical technique to find the skeleton of 

the pore space, the skeleton runs through the centers of the pores and throats and defines the 

topology (LINDQUIST; VENKATARANGAN, 1999; LINDQUIST et al., 2000). 

2.2.4 Image Analysis 

Image analysis consisted of calculating the ? density, macroporosity (MP), Gama (?a) 

and pore surface area density (SA density) as specified in the following, using results from the 

BoneJ algorithm implemented in ImageJ. 

? density (connectivity density) 

? density (mm-3) was calculated by the quotient of the Euler number (?) and the volume 

of the image (mm³). As soil images with two spatial resolutions were available, the 

transformation of the Euler number into ? density allows to compare the values without bias, 

since when doing this operation, the dependence of the spatial resolution is removed. 

  



28 

The Euler number (?), also called the Euler-Poincaré characteristic, describes the shape 

or structure of a topological space regardless of the way it is bent. The Euler number is one of 

the Minkowski functionals and a topological measure used for describing the connectivity of 

spatial structures (ARNS; KNACKSTEDT; MECKE, 2002; VOGEL; ROTH, 2001; VOGEL; 

WELLER; SCHLÜTER, 2010). In 3D, the Euler number is calculated as: ? = N – C + H, where 

N is the number of isolated pores, C is the number of redundant connections or loops within the 

pore space often referred as connectivity or genus and H is the number of completely enclosed 

cavities in the considered soil volume (VOGEL, 1997, VOGEL; ROTH, 2001). Increasing 

positive values of the Euler number indicate decreasing connectivity of the structure, and 

decreasing negative values indicate increasing connectivity (VOGEL, 1997).  

The algorithm uses voxel neighborhoods to calculate the Euler number of the volume 

and adjusts this to give the contribution of the volume to the connectivity of the structure it was 

obtained from. Toriwaki and Yonekura (2002) present fundamental properties of topological 

structure of a 3D digitized picture and provide a method to treat topology of digitized 3D figure. 

Macroporosity (MP) 

Macroporosity was obtained by the determination of the volume occupied by pores 

relative to the total image volume. For the images with low spatial resolution, only pores larger 

than 40 µm can be visualized; and for the images with high spatial resolution, pores larger than 

12 µm can be visualized and quantified. 

SA density 

Pore surface area density (SA density, mm-1) was calculated by the sum of the pore 

surface area (mm2) of each individual pore and divided by the image volume (mm3). The 

algorithm measures the pore surface area from a surface mesh. 

Gama (?a) 

Gama (?a) is a dimensionless connectivity indicator for a specific phase (RENARD; 

ALLARD, 2013) indicating individual pore clusters calculated by:

 2.1 

where each cluster of phase a has a label i and a size ni, Nl is the number of clusters and Nn is 

the number of all phase a voxels.  



29 

?a has a lower value when the porous system presents several isolated and non-

connected clusters of macropores; however, if the porous system is dominated by at least one 

large interconnected macropore, ?a has large value. Cluster labeling is typically achieved with 

a fast method by Hoshen and Kopelman (1976). ?a has the advantage over the popular Euler 

number that it is bounded by [0, 1] and less sensitive to noise (SCHLÜTER et al., 2014; 

SCHLÜTER; VOGEL, 2016). 

2.2.5 Retention curve from soil images 

The pores-size distribution was computed with the maximum inscribed sphere method 

as implemented in BoneJ from ImageJ (HILDEBRAND; RÜEGSEGGER, 1997; 

DOUGHERTY; KUNZELMANN, 2007; DOUBE et al., 2010), where the pore radii were 

determined by the volume of the inscribed sphere.  

In order to obtain the ?-h relation, pore diameters were transformed into pressure head 

h according to the Young-Laplace equation: 

 
gr

?? cos2
?  2.2 

where, ? is the water surface tension (? = 0.073 N m-1 at 20 °C), ? is contact angle (normally 

considered to be 0º for pure water and clean mineral surfaces), ? is the water specific gravity (? 

= 1000 kg m-3), g is gravity (g = 9.81 m s-2 at the Earth surface), and r is the pore radius [m]. 

The volumetric water content, ?, was assumed to be equal to the volume occupied by the 

correspondent pore relative to the total volume.  

Hydraulic properties were expressed according to the Van Genuchten – Mualem 

equations (VAN GENUCHTEN, 1980):

where Se is the effective saturation, ? is the water content, ?s is the saturated water content; ?r, 

residual water content; ? and n are empirical constants affecting the shape of the retention curve; 

l is a pore-connectivity parameter. The parameters for Equation 2.3 were obtained with the 

nonlinear least-squares optimization program RETC (VAN GENUCHTEN; LEIJ; YATES, 

1991; YATES et al., 1992). 



30 

2.2.6 Evaporation method 

For water-based determinations, a simultaneous measurement of ?(h) and K(h) was 

conducted using the evaporation method of Schindler (1980), a simplification of the Wind 

(1968) approach. The simplified method of Schindler uses pressure head measurements, h1 and 

h2, at only two different depths, z1 and z2. The same undisturbed soil samples used for image 

acquisition, taken in the PVC rings, was employed for the evaporation experiment. Samples 

were slowly saturated by capillarity, after which two Hyprop tensiometers (HYdraulic 

PROPerty analyzer, UMS, Munich) (SCHINDLER et al., 2010) were vertically inserted in the 

sample through drilled holes with centers at 50 (z1) and 25 mm (z2) vertical distance from the 

sample bottom. The sample was sealed at the bottom and placed on a balance, leaving the 

surface free to evaporate. Tensions (h) at two heights and sample masses (M) were measured at 

pre-determinate time intervals. The hydraulic gradient (im) was calculated from the tension 

values and the tensiometer distance. The flux density (q) was derived from the soil water-mass 

difference ?M per surface area (A) and time unit (?t). Single points of the water-retention curve 

were calculated based on water loss per volume of the core sample at time t and the mean 

tension in the sample at that time. The hydraulic conductivity (K) was calculated by

where h  is the mean tension, averaged over the upper and the lower tensiometer and the time

interval ?t = t2 – t1, ? is the density of water, and im is the mean hydraulic gradient in the

Hydraulic properties were expressed according to the Van Genuchten – Mualem 

equations (VAN GENUCHTEN, 1980), equation 2.3 for retention and for hydraulic 

conductivity K:

where Ks is the hydraulic conductivity at saturation and l is a pore-connectivity parameter.  

To obtain the fitting parameters, Equations 2.3 and 2.6 were simultaneously fitted to the data 

from the evaporation experiments. 

The hydraulic conductivity is affected by both by pore size distribution and by the 

continuity and tortuosity of flow path. The effects of these two factors is represented by the 

exponent l in Equation 2.6. In most studies, l is considered constant and equal to 0.5, as 

determined by Mualem (1976) on a dataset with 45 soils. 

2.2.7 Correlation of parameters and multiple regression analysis 

Spearman correlations were used to investigate the correlation between parameters from 

water-based hydraulic parameters and pore-space image parameters. The Spearman correlation 

matrix is used for non-parametric correlations, not requiring the assumption that the relationship 

between variables is linear, nor requiring quantitative variables (SIEGEL; CASTELLAN 

JÚNIOR, 2006). 

For calibration of hydraulic parameters as a function of image parameters, eight samples 

were chosen randomly to perform a stepwise multiple regression analysis, thus obtaining the 

equation for each soil hydraulic parameter. The remaining four samples were used for 

validation, applying the calibrated equations to predict the soil hydraulic parameters and 

comparing those to the water-based hydraulic parameters. 

2.3 Results and Discussion 

2.3.1 Image parameters 

Table 2.2 shows the pore space image parameters at low (40 µm) and high (12 µm) 

spatial resolution; as the images with high spatial resolution (12 µm) were obtained from 

preview images, only a portion of the sample volume was analyzed, resulting in different 

parameters values for both spatial resolutions.

Pore space heterogeneity affects results between samples at the two spatial resolutions, 

40 µm and 12 µm, therefore, resulting in different values of pore space image parameters. Soil 

images obtained with spatial resolution of 12 µm presented smaller values of the  

Euler number and, consequently, of ? density, indicating a higher connectivity.  



33 

This result is expected, since a higher spatial resolution allows to visualize smaller pores, 

including packing pores and intra-aggregate pores; however, part of soil porosity is not 

quantified by the image analysis due to the spatial resolution restriction. Also, higher values of 

macroporosity were obtained on the images with the higher spatial resolution, since it is more 

likely for a macropore to occupy a larger fraction of the image volume.  

Soil image parameters are also dependent of the threshold employed, therefore different 

threshold methods will result in different parameters values. Additionally, the method is 

somehow subjective and different results are expected to be obtained for different observers. 

Baveye et al. (2010) conducted an investigation to determine how much variation exists among 

the outcomes of various image thresholding strategies (including any image pre-treatment 

deemed appropriate), routinely adopted by soil scientists. The authors found out that experts 

rely on very different approaches to threshold images of soils and that there is observer bias 

associated with this thresholding; experts, relying on various combinations of subjective 

procedures (e.g., manual contrast adjustment, visual thresholding) and automated steps, 

produced thresholded images that in some cases vary significantly with respect to simple 

quantitative measures, like porosity. 

2.3.2 Soil hydraulic properties 

Figure 2.1 shows the water retention data obtained from the microtomography images 

and from the evaporation experiments. Results are consistent with the results obtained with 

pore-size distribution from image analysis and measured retention data.  

Due to image resolution, image analysis allows only the determination of the wet range 

of the curve. For images with 40 µm spatial resolution, the lower pore radius is 49.4 µm, 

corresponding to pressure heads of -0.30 m; and for images with 12 µm spatial resolution, the 

lower pore radius is 24.3 µm, corresponding to pressure heads of -0.61 m. Probably the non-

identification/quantification of some smaller pores occurred due to the processes of 

segmentation and morphological operations, in which small individual pores are identify as 

solids or incorporated in a neighboring larger pore. In the binary image it is very difficult to 

obtain pores with spatial resolution size, because very small pores (with sizes close to the spatial 

resolution) join to other pores or are hidden in the process of both segmentation and 

morphological operation.  



34 

The part of the retention curve that can be measured using the water-based method with 

Hyprop tensiometers (EE) is limited by tensiometer specifications. In our experiments we were 

able to measure down to -10 m, so the drier range could not be quantified. 

Hydraulic conductivity functions for soils Rhodic Ferralsol, Rhodic Lixisol, Xanthic 

Ferralsol and Rhodic Nitosol obtained from the evaporation experiments model fits are 

represented in Figure 2.2. In general, the Xanthic Ferralsol presents a lower hydraulic 

conductivity, corroborating with its high bulk density and sandy clay loam texture (Table 2.1); 

this soil also presents a higher dispersion for parameters n and ? (Table 2.3), which reflects in 

its retention (Figure 2.1) and hydraulic conductivity (Figure 2.2) curves. The variability may be 

due to natural soil spatial variability, indicating that the samples may have been smaller than 

the Representative Elementary Volume.  

Parameter n (n &gt; 1) is related to the pore-size distribution, higher values being associated 

with a homogeneous pore size distribution; n influences the slope of the retention curve at its 

inflection, as seen for e.g. the Xanthic Ferralsol (Figure 2.1) with a  

high n (Table 2.3). Parameter ? is related to the inverse of the air-entry pressure and scales the 

retention curve along the x-axis. Higher values of ? scale the curve closer to the y-axis making 

the matric potential at inflection to increase and to correspond to larger pores. With respect to 

the hydraulic conductivity (Figure 2.2), for the Rhodic Lixisol, the high value of n for sample 

3 (Table 2.3) made its values for K to be higher than for the other two samples; being also 

observed for sample 1 of the Rhodic Nitosol.

Fitting parameters for Equations 2.3 and 2.6 are shown in Table 2.3 (for the image 

analysis, hydraulic conductivity parameter l was not determined). It should be observed that 

parameters ?s and ?r are mere fitting parameters without clear physical meaning. The water 

content obtained by oven drying is defined as zero, and is normally less than ?r. Water contents 

below the residual water content ?r are physically possible but cannot be investigated with the 

empirical model used here.  

Regarding the l parameter, observed values ranged from -1.68 to 1.49. Negative values 

for l are often reported (SCHUH; CLINE, 1990; KAVEH; VAN GENUCHTEN, 1992; YATES 

et al., 1992; KOSUGI, 1999; SCHAAP; LEIJ, 2000; OH; KIM; KIM, 2015; PINHEIRO; VAN 

LIER; METSELAAR, 2017). Schuh and Cline (1990) reported l varying between -8.73 and 

14.80, for a data set of 75 soil samples. Schaap and Leij (2000) found  

l = -1, as optimal value that minimized the root mean square error for 235 soil samples from all 

texture range. A negative value of l implies in an increasing connectivity of water-filled pores 

with decreasing soil moisture content, which intuitively does not seem realistic (VEREECKEN 

et al., 2010). 

Although parameter l has been labeled an indicator of tortuosity and connectivity, its 

exact physical meaning is unclear (VOGEL, 2000; GHANBARIAN et al., 2013). Ghanbarian 

et al. (2013) discussed the concept of tortuosity, its varying definitions in the literature, and 

their significance. They also highlight the issue if tortuosity is an intrinsic property of the 

medium, of a process within the medium, or neither, being simply an adjustable parameter used 

to improve the agreement between theory and experiment. Because the tortuosity has a 

pronounced saturation dependence, tortuosity cannot simply be a property of the medium itself 

but must be derived from the actual paths of flow, conduction, or transport involved. Hoffmann-

Riem, Van Genuchten and Flühler (1999) concluded that models based on  

Eq. (2.6) should not be interpreted as being physically based. Schaap and Leij (2000) also treat 

l as an empirical parameter.

2.3.3 Correlation between image parameters and hydraulic parameters 

Spearman's correlation evaluates the monotonic relationship between two continuous or 

ordinal variables. In a monotonic relationship, the variables tend to change together but not 

necessarily at a constant rate. The Spearman correlation coefficient is based on the graded 

values of each variable, rather than the data. The negative sign of correlation means that the 

variables vary in the opposite direction, that is, the higher categories of one variable are 

associated with lower categories of the other variable. 

The Spearman correlation matrix (Table 2.4) and p-values (Table 2.5),  

at 5% of significance, show ?s, ? and n to have a monotonic association between the variables. 

?s and ? show a strong positive association with MP, while n was strongly associated to SA 

density. ?s showed a strong negative association with ? density; parameters l and ?r weak 

association with any image pore space parameter.

Observed hydraulic parameters obtained from the evaporation experiments  

and predicted parameters with stepwise multiple regression are plotted in Figure 2.3. Although 

l and ?r show weak correlations to image parameters of pore space, the prediction of those 

parameters using image data was performed and plotted, in order to show the accuracy and 

dispersion. Predicted values of ?s were underestimated, while the predicted values  

of n were overestimated. Results show that the employed statistical model (stepwise multiple 

regression) was not able to explain how pore space geometry relates to hydraulic property 

parameters, since for all hydraulic parameters the RMSE for validation was higher than the 

RMSE for validation.  

The use of the Van Genuchten (1980) model assumes that the pore size distribution of 

the soil can be described by a single unimodal pore size distribution function, and that the pore 

system can be described as a bundle of capillaries with flow processes governed by the 

principles of capillary flow. Moreover, capillaries are filled either with water or with air, 

without accounting for film flow that may dominate in relatively dry soils (VEREECKEN et 

al., 2010). These assumptions, allied to uncertainties concerning the physical meaning of l and 

limitations of the statistical model result in the low correlation between l and pore space image 

parameters.

The prediction of soil hydraulic properties through CT image analysis is still a challenge, 

processes that occur in the soil depend on several factors that must be quantified and included 

with the characteristics of the pore space for an adequate prediction; along with the use of more 

complex hydraulic conductivity models that include information on the pore space shape and 

arrangement. 

Quantification of soil characteristics though images is a powerful and promise 

technique, although there is still some limitations attached with the computer power, spatial 

resolution, lack of standard methodology to process and analyze soil images; this technique 

allows the quantification of several soil characteristics with only one image. 

2.4 Conclusions 

Determination of soil hydraulic parameters using image analysis may be performed in a 

small range close to saturation (-0.0045 to -0.61 m), due to the current limitation of the spatial 

resolution of the microtomograph.  

Weak correlations were obtained between measured hydraulic parameters from the Van 

Genuchten model and pore space image parameters through stepwise multiple regression 

analysis, thus this statistical model was not able to explain how pore space geometry relates to 

hydraulic properties parameters from an empirical model.

3 FUNCTIONAL EVALUATION OF SOIL HYDRAULIC PARAMETERIZATION 

IN SOME TROPICAL SOILS 

Abstract 

Soil hydraulic properties (SHP) are needed to quantify water balance components in 

vadose zone hydrological models. Retention properties can be measured directly using field or 

laboratory methods, but determining unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is more troublesome 

and commonly it is predicted from retention data, introducing an empirical parameter related to 

tortuosity and connectivity. The value of this parameter is usually not determined, but, instead, 

a standard value is applied. We evaluated the sensitivity of the predictions of an agro-

hydrological model to the tortuosity/connectivity parameter, applying its commonly used 

standard value or determining its value in laboratory evaporation experiments using wet-range 

tensiometers, dry-range tensiometers, or both wet- and dry-range tensiometers. Four tropical 

soils from Brazil were used for the analysis. Simulations with the agro-hydrological model were 

performed for some years with distinct rainfall characteristics. 

Keywords: tortuosity factor, SWAP, soil hydraulic properties 

3.1 Introduction 

Soil hydraulic property (SHP) functions, i.e. the hydraulic conductivity and water 

retention functions, are essentials for vadose zone hydrological modeling applied to predict 

agronomic and ecological processes. Such models are used to simulate the transport of water, 

solutes and heat in saturated and unsaturated soil zones. Richards’s equation (RICHARDS, 

1948) based models integrated with plant growth modules can predict relative or absolute 

water-limited crop yield (DROOGERS et al., 2004; MO et al., 2005; DE JONG VAN LIER; 

WENDROTH; VAN DAM, 2015), water use efficiency, nutrient transport (WOLF et al., 2003; 

PINTO et al., 2017), irrigation management (UTSET et al., 2004; RALLO et al., 2012), and 

crop water availability (VAN WART; GRASSINI; CASMAN, 2013; IDEN; PETERS; 

DURNER, 2015; PINHEIRO; VAN LIER; METSELAAR, 2017), among other processes. 

Whereas retention properties can be measured directly using relatively simple field or 

laboratory methods, determining hydraulic conductivity for unsaturated conditions is much 

more troublesome and commonly it is predicted from retention data using pore size models or 

statistical models. These models predict the hydraulic conductivity by integration of elementary 

pore domains, represented by a range of pore radii, e.g. the models of Childs and Collis-George 



48 
 

(1950), Burdine (1953) and Mualem (1976). To deal with the unknown pore space tortuosity 

and connectivity, an empirical parameter is introduced in these models. 

In the Mualem (1976) hydraulic conductivity model, based on the capillary bundle 

theory, a parameter l was introduced to account for eccentricity of the flow path. The value of 

l = 0.5 was obtained by Mualem (1976) using a data set of 45 soil samples. The physical 

meaning of l is unclear and it may be considered as an integral of all model uncertainties 

together (VOGEL, 2000). 

Computed water balances are very sensitive to soil hydraulic parameters and therefore 

their accurate determination is essential to model hydrological processes (JOHRAR et al., 

2004). Vereecken et al. (1992) showed that the uncertainty in hydraulic parameters results in a 

considerable variation of simulated soil moisture supply capacity and of the downward flux 

below the root zone. 

In comprehensive analyses of soil-plant-atmosphere relations involving agro-

hydrological simulations, models are parameterized and calibrated to simulate involved 

processes under specific climate, soil and plant scenarios, which may be based on present data 

or refer to expected or otherwise possible scenarios. Generally, models are projected to provide 

fair pictures of the behavior of the studied systems under likely scenarios, though, the reliability 

of simulations depends on model parameterization. Soil properties play a very important role 

in agro-hydrological simulations, especially because SHP determine all water fluxes, those 

towards the root system (driving plant growth), drainage and evaporation rate. 

Even when simple soil-water relations approaches are used like the plant-available water 

calculated based on two water contents (field capacity and permanent wilting point), although 

commonly assumed to be related only to retention properties, in a more detailed process-based 

analysis those two water contents are determined by both water retention and pore connectivity 

viz. hydraulic conductivity (TAWARAKAVI; ŠIM?NEK; SCHAAP, 2010; DE JONG VAN 

LIER; WENDROTH, 2016; ASSOULINE; OR, 2014).  

Several methods of estimating SHP are currently available, however, most of them yield 

incomplete information, focusing only on water retention characteristics and pore size 

distribution, lacking information on pore arrangement and connectivity. Most of the agro-

hydrological simulations are run with water retention data only, which probably 

underrepresents the process-based behavior of soil-plant-atmosphere systems. Regarding water 

retention, simpler indirect methods have been implemented, for instance, pedotransfer 

functions, which are predictive equations that relate more easily measurable general soil data 

to water retention and hydraulic parameters (BOUMA; VAN LANEN, 1987; BOUMA, 1989; 



49 
 

VAN DEN BERG et al., 1997). However, pedotransfer functions, besides of being subject to 

statistical errors, require a reliable and large dataset, and are mostly applied to soil water 

retention. 

Analyzing evaporation experiment data using inverse solution methods stands as a 

powerful tool to characterize SHP for a large range of soil water contents (ŠIM?NEK; 

WENDROTH; VAN GENUCHTEN, 1998; PINHEIRO; VAN LIER; METSELAAR, 2017). 

In this study, we assessed soil hydraulic properties from evaporation experiments for different 

pressure head ranges. The tortuosity factor l was fitted using water retention curves determined 

in the traditional pressure chamber desorption method. In order to analyze the adequacy of the 

parameterized SHP in predicting soil hydraulic processes and to pinpoint their effect on agro-

hydrological simulations, a functional evaluation was performed for years with distinct rainfall 

characteristics under climatic conditions of a southeast Brazilian climate. 

3.2 Material and Methods 

3.2.1 Soil sampling 

Undisturbed and disturbed soil samples were collected in four soils from distinct soil 

classes (Rhodic Ferralsol, Rhodic Lixisol, Xanthic Ferrasol and Rhodic Nitossol) located in São 

Paulo State, Brazil. Particle size distribution, bulk and particle density from the sampled soils 

are shown in Table 1. Both soils were sampled in their surface horizon, between the depths of 

0.1 and 0.3 m. Two different sizes of undisturbed samples were collected: larger samples in 

PVC rings (75 mm diameter and 75 mm height) for subsequent use in the wet-range evaporation 

experiments, and smaller samples in aluminum rings (50 mm diameter and 30 mm height) to 

be used in the traditional desorption experiments and for the measurement of saturated 

hydraulic conductivity (Ks) using a constant head permeameter. Disturbed soil material was 

used in dry-range evaporation experiments and for the determination of particle density and 

particle-size distribution.

3.2.2 Experiments 

Three protocols of soil hydraulic parameterization were used: the traditional desorption 

method yielding retention data, and wet-range evaporation and dry-range evaporation methods, 

yielding both retention and hydraulic conductivity data.  

The traditional desorption method, here identified as RC, followed the conventional 

procedure which consisted of measuring soil water content in the smaller samples after 

desorption at specific tensions. Tensions from -0.1 to -0.6 m were applied using a tension 

Table and for higher tensions (-1 to -150 m) a porous plate pressure chamber was used.  

The final water content of the soil sample was determined by comparing to oven-dry  

(105 °C) mass. 

The wet-range evaporation experiments (EEwet, measured pressure head 

between -1 and -10 m) were conducted using the larger undisturbed soil samples which were 

equipped with two Hyprop tensiometers (SCHINDLER et al., 2010) vertically inserted in the 

sample through drilled holes with centers at 25 and 50 mm vertical distance from the sample 

bottom. The methodology used to determine unsaturated hydraulic conductivity was the 

simplified evaporation method (SCHINDLER, 1980; PETERS; DURNER, 2008), a 

simplification of the Wind (1968) approach. The soil-water flux was determined by the 

measurement of water tension using the two tensiometer cells at different positions. Soil 

samples were saturated by capillarity and tensiometers inserted and the sample bottom was 

sealed. The assembly was placed on an auto-logging balance and the measurement cycle was 

started. The pressure head and sample mass were recorded at pre-determined times until the 

mass of the sample reached a constant value. At the end of the measurement, the final water 



51 
 

content of the soil sample was determined by oven drying at 105 °C. The mass and pressure 

head measurements were used for the calculation of the soil-water flux.  

The dry-range evaporation experiments (EEdry, measured pressure head range 

between -1.5 and -165 m) were carried out with disturbed soil samples. A polyvinyl chloride 

ring (0.1 m high and 0.1 m in diameter) was filled with air-dry and sieved soil material and 

slowly saturated with water from bottom to top by imbibition from a shallow layer of tap water. 

After that, the bottom was sealed and three polymer tensiometers were horizontally inserted in 

the sample through drilled holes with centers at 25, 50 and 75 mm vertical distance from the 

sample surface (VAN DER PLOEG et al., 2010; DURIGON et al., 2011; PINHEIRO; VAN 

LIER; METSELAAR, 2017). Then, the set of soil sample and tensiometers was placed on a 

precision balance. Measurements of ring sample weight and pressure heads were automatically 

logged every 10 min. The evaporation experiment was finished when the upper tensiometer 

reached a pressure head value below -165 m, which took in the order  

of 3 weeks. At the end of the measurement, the final water content of the soil sample was 

determined by oven drying at 105 °C. 

3.2.3 Soil hydraulic parameterization (SHP) 

Unsaturated SHP were assumed to be defined by K-?-h relations (equations 1 and 2) 

described by the Van Genuchten-Mualem model (VAN GENUCHTEN, 1980).

and saturated hydraulic conductivity, respectively (m d-1); and ? (m-1), n and l are fitting 

parameters. 

Five sets of SHP were obtained for each soil: 

1.  Using the inverse solution obtained from evaporation experiment data from the 

wet range experiments (EEwet) 

2.  Using the inverse solution obtained from evaporation experiment data from the 

dry range experiments (EEdry)  



52 
 

3.  Using the inverse solution obtained from evaporation experiment data from the 

wet and dry range experiments together (EEwet+dry) 

4.  Using the retention data from tension Table / pressure chamber, measured Ks and 

l = 0.5 (RCl=0.5),  

5.  Using the retention data from tension Table / pressure chamber, measured Ks and 

l fitted according to K values obtained in EEwet+dry (RCl-fit) 

 

The first three sets (EEwet, EEdry, and EEwet+dry) were obtained by an inverse one-

dimensional solution using Hydrus-1D (ŠIM?NEK; VAN GENUCHTEN; ŠEJNA, 2008). 

Hydrus-1D implements a Marquardt-Levenberg type parameter estimation technique for 

inverse optimization of soil hydraulic parameters (ŠIM?NEK; VAN GENUCHTEN; ŠEJNA, 

2012). The upper and lower water flow boundary conditions were set as atmospheric boundary 

condition and constant flux (zero), respectively. Surface evaporation flux for each time interval 

was calculated from observed mass difference over a time interval and used as a time variable 

boundary conditions. The following information from the experimental data was included into 

the objective function: (i) pressure heads measured at the two (for EEwet) or three (for EEdry) 

depths over time and (ii) the final soil water content. In order to achieve robust minimization, 

data associated to the different soil textural classes available in the soil hydraulic catalog of 

Hydrus-1D were used as starting values. 

The water retention parameters SHP for the RC methods were obtained from retention 

data using the nonlinear least-squares optimization program RETC (VAN GENUCHTEN et al., 

1991; YATES et al., 1992). For RCl=0.5, l was considered to be equal to 0.5 for all soils. For 

RCl-fit, the value of l was optimized using the values of K observed in EEwet+dry. 

3.2.4 Agro-hydrological simulations 

In order to functionally analyze the effect of the different protocols to achieve  

soil hydraulic parameterization using agro-hydrological simulations, we used the  

SWAP model (KROES et al., 2008) to simulate soils cropped with maize. Weather data were 

retrieved from the University of São Paulo weather station in Piracicaba, Brazil  

(22º 42’ 30” S; 47º 38’ 00” W, 546 m) for three distinct years in terms of rainfall: high rainfall 

(1995; 784 mm of rain during the crop growing season from February 1 to June 30), low rainfall 

(2014; 266 mm) and average rainfall (2011; 581 mm). The lower boundary condition for 

hydrological simulation was considered as free drainage, with a maximum rooting depth of 1 m.

for the three years from one month before seeding to the end of the simulated crop cycle.

The SWAP model simulates water flow, solute transport and plant growth in a soil–

water–atmosphere–plant environment. To calculate the water balance terms, the model employs 

the Richards equation with a root water extraction sink term:

In this equation, t denotes time (d), z is the vertical coordinate taken as positive upwards 

(cm), K(h) is the hydraulic conductivity (cm d-1) and S(h) represents the water uptake by plant 

roots (d-1). Equation 3.3 is solved numerically describing the ?–h–K relation by the Mualem–

van Genuchten equations (MUALEM, 1976; VAN GENUCHTEN, 1980).  

To estimate the sink term S(h), the reduction function proposed by Feddes et al. (1976) 

and Feddes, Kowalik and Zaradny (1978) implemented in the SWAP model was used. It 

computes relative plant transpiration based on five threshold pressure heads (Table 3.2). 

Consequently, the prediction of crop water stress and crop transpiration under specific scenarios 

depends greatly on soil hydraulic parameterization, a poor parameterization being likely to 

bring about unreliable outcomes leading to possibly erroneous conclusions.

3.3 Results and Discussion 

3.3.1 Soil hydraulic parameterization 

The five sets of SHP for each soil are shown in Table 3.3. Respective RMSE values 

correspond to each specific parameter fitting procedure. For RCl=0.5, the parameter fitting was 

performed as function of ? and the RMSE was calculated accordingly. For RCl-fit, RMSE refers 

to the observed hydraulic conductivity data from the EEwet+dry and to the predicted K for the 



55 
 

optimized l. The RMSE of EEdry was calculated using h values; RMSE for EEwet+dry was 

calculated related to K; for EEwet, RMSE was calculated using log K. 

When parameter fitting is based on the dry range alone, parameters at saturated 

conditions (?s and Ks) should be understood as mere fitting parameters and cannot be interpreted 

as if they were really measured at saturation. Extrapolation beyond the range of pressure heads 

measured during the evaporation experiment is associated with a high level of uncertainty 

(ŠIM?NEK; WENDROTH; VAN GENUCHTEN, 1998).

Figure 3.2 shows pressure head (h) as function of volumetric water content (?) for the 

parameterization methods. Retention curve parameters for RCl=0.5 and RCl-fit were obtained 

from the same procedure and are identified in this Figure by RC. The fitting process in the 

EEwet+dry parameterization fitted the parameter values between EEwet and EEdry values, i.e., ?s 

EEwet+dry ? ?s EEwet and ?r EEwet+dry ? ?r EEdry. The shape of the EEwet+dry retention curve for 

the Xanthic Ferralsol (Figure 3.2) is a result of the high value of ?r obtained for EEdry (Table 

3.3). 

The discontinuity observed in Figure 3.2 between curves from different 

parameterizations may be due to the use of disturbed (EEdry) and undisturbed (EEwet and RC) 

soil samples in the different experiments. The traditional pressure chamber desorption curve 

RC tends to overestimate soil-water content close to saturation, whereas in the dry range curves 

come together. The fitted water retention model does not take into account adsorptive forces 

(LI; WARDLAW, 1986; LENORMAND, 1990; NIMMO, 1991, PETERS, 2013), it only 

accounts for capillary water retention, and according to Vereecken et al. (2010) this may lead 

to some undesirable drawbacks. Theoretically, the soil-water retention curve is measured under 

equilibrium conditions; however, practically, when measuring the soil-water retention curve 

e.g., using the porous plate pressure method, as the soil becomes drier, it deviates further from 

equilibrium (HUNT; SKINNER, 2005), this may be due to the lack of equilibrium at relatively 

high tensions which correspond to very low hydraulic conductivity, not providing equilibrium 

conditions. 

  



57 
 

Soil hydraulic conductivity is affected not only by soil pore size distribution 

(information contained in the retention curve), but also by pore continuity and tortuosity, which 

determine the flow path. The inclusion of parameter l in Equation , supposed to account for the 

correlation between pores and the flow path tortuosity, enhances the agreement between 

theoretical and experimental curves (MUALEM, 1976). For that reason, the use of a fixed value 

for l, like 0.5 as found for the Mualem (1976) data set, causes a mismatch in many soils and is 

likely to increase the uncertainty in hydrological simulations. According to Pachepsky (1990), 

the assumed constant value of l = 0.5 is in disagreement with the fact that the tortuosity factor 

strongly depends on soil structure and texture in addition to its dependence on soil moisture 

content. Assouline and Or (2013) found that the value of  

the l (Equation 3.2) depends on the specific soil-fluid properties and varies considerably for 

different soils.

Observed values of the l parameter in our soils ranged from around -7 to +4 (Table 3.3). 

Negative values for l are often reported (SCHUH; CLINE, 1990; KAVEH; VAN 

GENUCHTEN, 1992; YATES et al., 1992; KOSUGI, 1999; SCHAAP; LEIJ, 2000; OH; KIM; 

KIM, 2015; PINHEIRO; VAN LIER; METSELAAR, 2017). Schaap and Leij (2000) found l 

= -1, as optimal value that minimizes root mean square error, on 235 soil samples on all texture 

range. Leij, Russell and Lesch (1997) obtained a mean value of l = -0.72 when  

401 pairs of water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity data were considered. A 

negative value of l implies that the connectivity of water-filled pores increases with decreasing 

soil moisture content, which intuitively does not seem realistic (VEREECKEN et al., 2010). 

Therefore, some authors (HOFFMANN-RIEM; VAN GENUCHTEN; FLÜHLER, 1999; 

SCHAAP; LEIJ, 2000) suggest that l should be treated merely as an empirical parameter 

without physical meaning. 

3.3.2 Agro-hydrological simulations 

In addition to the numerical interpretation of parameter values, a functional 

interpretation will reveal the effect of parameter differences on soil processes as simulated by 

a hydrological model. Employing Richards equation-based models with a detailed description 

of soil-root zone processes allows to evaluate how different soil hydraulic parameterizations 

may impact model predictions of key processes in the soil-plant-atmosphere system.  

The simulated pressure head values at 10 cm depth during the maize crop cycle using 

the different set of SHP (Figure 3.4) show the stress occurrence by drought or water excess for 

the Rhodic Nitossol at the three rainfall scenarios. Figure 3.5 shows the same data for the 

average rainfall year in the four studied soils. The threshold pressure head that defines the onset 

of stress is based on the Feddes parameters compiled by Taylor and Ashcroft (1972) for the 

maize crop (Table 3.2). Pressure head values between thresholds h2 and h3 represent the 

optimum range for crop growth with absence of water stress. 

In general, simulations using SHP from RC and RCl=0.5 predicted very short stress 

periods, while the other methods produced more restrictive scenarios. For the dry year, SHP 

obtained from the retention curve (with and without l fitting) and especially from EEdry,

In every period in which there is accumulation of rainfall and/or intense rainfall event, 

EEdry, RCl=0.5 and RCl-fit simulates an anoxic stress (h &amp;lt;h2), only at the Rhodic Lixisol

conductivity at high potentials presented by those parametrizations (Figure 3.3), which allows 

that occurs a slower water redistribution in the soil, along with soil already in wet condition, in 

the cases of accumulated rainfall, which causes the soil to remain with its water volumetric 

content close to saturation, providing the anoxic stress. Thus, the anoxic stress is sensible to 

values of Ks. In the case of Rhodic Lixisol for EEwet+dry parameterization, besides a high value 

of Ks, EEwet+dry retention curve and hydraulic conductivity curve present low inclination, which 

causes low reduction of water volumetric content with increase of pressure.

Drought stress (h &amp;lt;h3) is simulated more frequently for soils with a low d?/dh in the 

dry part. When these soils approach dry conditions, a small reduction of the volumetric water 

content leads to a strong decrease in the potential. For the Rhodic Lixisol, Xanthic Ferralsol 

and Rhodic Nitosol, EEdry and EEwet simulate higher drought stress (Figure 3.5); while in 

Rhodic Ferralsol, EEwet+dry is the parametrization that simulates the highest drought stress. 

Figure 3.2 shows the low inclination of the retention curve for the mentioned parameterizations 

that simulate drought stress and the respective soils. Values of h above h4 are also associated 

with a low inclination of the retention curve and occurs especially when atmospheric demand 

is high, more often during the dry year (Figure 3.4). 

RCl=0.5 and RCl-fit at optimal conditions (h2 ? h ? h3) have a similar behavior, however, 

RCl-fit simulates higher pressure heads, due to its higher hydraulic conductivity, caused by the 

negative value of tortuosity factor. Under the same optimal condition for the Xanthic Ferralsol, 

simulated values of h are very similar for both RCl=0.5 and RCl-fit (l = -1.1).  

When h &gt; h2, their behavior becomes different. 

RCl=0.5, RCl-fit and EEdry, especially, simulated stresses by water excess at high and 

average rainfall, causing a drop in the simulated relative crop yield (Figure 3.6). EEwet did not 

simulate stress by water excess for any year, not even for the wet year. Apparently, 

parametrization of only the dry part did not allow a proper simulation of near-saturated 

conditions, not resulting in excess water stress as simulated by EEwet. 

Simulations with EEdry yielded different results than EEwet and EEwet+dry, especially for 

the wet and average year; thus, we can conclude that parameterization only for the dry-range is 

not adequate for simulations when wet condition are dominating. Figure 3.5 highlights this 

condition for the Rhodic Lixisol and Xanthic Ferrasol during the average year, where the EEdry 

parameterization simulated very different conditions than other parameterizations, especially 

when compared to EEwet and EEwet+dry.  

Hupet, Van Dam and VanClooster (2004) investigated the impact of within-field 

variability in the soil hydraulic properties on actual transpiration and dry matter yield for three 

different climate scenarios. They also evaluated sensitivity of the simulated actual transpiration 

and dry matter yield to soil hydraulic parameters, which increases with the dryness of the 

climate. Their simulation results showed very different results of the agro-hydrological 

simulations according to the climatic scenarios (wet, average and dry year). The sensitivity of 

the actual transpiration rate and the dry matter to the soil hydraulic parameters (?s, n, ? and Ks) 

was often very similar, being a direct consequence of conceptualizations in agro-hydrological 

models to reduce the daily potential gross CO2 assimilation rate.

Figure 3.6 shows the relative yield, simulated by the SWAP model, for the particular 

case of the Rhodic Nitossol cropped with maize during the wet, average and dry year, while 

Figure 3.7 shows the maize relative yield simulated for the average year at the fours soils 

studied, using the five soil hydraulic parameterizations. Relative yield was calculated by the 

quotient between potential yield and water-limited yield. Potential yield takes into account solar 

radiation, temperature, CO2, genetic potential of the plant, while the water-limited yield also 

takes into account water availability, which in our case, was simulated based on Feddes, 

Kowalik and Zaradny (1978) reduction function.  

In well drained soils during periods with average and high rainfall, the relative yield is 

expected to reach values close to unity. In our simulations, only the SHP obtained from EEwet+dry 

(the widest range of evaluated water contents) predicted relative yields close to the maximum. 

The simulation using SHP from EEwet also reached values close to 1. For periods with rainfall 

supply, pressure heads of cropped soils hardly ever drop to very negative values, therefore, the 

SHP obtained from wet range experiments may be supposed to be able to yield good simulation 

results.  

The simulations predicted low relative yield for the Xanthic Ferralsol for all five 

parameterizations (Figure 3.7), especially for EEdry, due to the simulated stresses by drought 

and water excess (Figure 3.5). For all five parameterization methods this soil presented low 

values of ?s, due to the low total porosity (0.286 m
3m-3, Table 3.1), and high values of ?r, 

providing low soil water storage capacity. Besides that, the low inclination of the retention 

curve and the low hydraulic conductivity provided a stress-prone scenario.  

The poor performance of simulation using SHP acquired from EEdry is expected due to 

the lack of representativeness of SHP for wet conditions. The SHP from the retention curve 

with fitted tortuosity factor (l) when compared to l = 0.5, resulted in relative yields closer to the 

simulation performed with EEwet+dry. This shows that some constraints pointed by specific 

simulations in crop yield may be related to poor soil hydraulic parameterization rather than 

resource stress, e.g., water and energy. Yield predictions showed to be highly sensitive to soil 

hydraulic parameterization, even when this sensitivity does not show up strongly in predicted 

soil pressure head values.

The use of fixed parameters or inappropriate parameterization may lead to large errors 

in the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function (DURNER, 1994), impacting on predictions 

of unsaturated water flow in the vadose zone. None of current available measuring devices 

allows the measurement of the SHP over the entire range of soil water content (SCHELLE et 

al., 2013). The prediction of SHP from retention curve data with l optimized instead of a fixed 

value, as performed in this study, may be an interesting option, however, measurement 

techniques in which the natural soil structure is maintained and that provide records of soil-

water content or pressure head from saturation to complete dryness over time, coupled with 

inverse solution (ŠIM?NEK; WENDROTH; VAN GENUCHTEN, 1998), are essential for the 

understanding of unsaturated soil-water flow. As a recommendation, it is suggested that, where 

possible, perform measurements by the different methods on the same sample, ideally 

simultaneously. 

3.4 Conclusions 

1. The agro-hydrological simulations showed to be sensitive to the set of soil hydraulic 

parameters and to the range of pressure head for which they were determined. The 

existence of several uncertainties in the procedures of soil hydraulic parameterization 

restrain the extrapolation of soil hydraulic properties beyond the range of the K-?-h 

measured relation. 

2. Although parameterization for the wet range can represent well the realm of pressure 

heads experienced by the most crop systems, soil hydraulic parameterization using a 

wider range of pressure head is necessary to represent soil-water-plant relations in dry 

lands, where low soil-water content is the general rule. 

3. Comparing the simulation results using soil hydraulic properties from parameterization 

with retention data with a fixed value l = 0.5 and with a fitted l, the latter behaved more 

similar to the methods using a measured K-?-h relation (parameterization for the wet 

and dry range and parameterization for the wet range). 

4. The different methods to obtain the soil hydraulic properties were performed with 

different samples, some of them undisturbed and others sieved. Those factors are also 

embedded in the parameterizations results, and consequently, in simulations, and may 

have caused some of the observed differences.
