The geological evolution of the continental shelf and in the coastal zone of southern Brazil during the 
Quaternary period is addressed in this study. High-resolution seismic records obtained at the Patos 
Lagoon revealed the presence of channels that deeply dissected the coastal zone before the formation 
of the modern, low-relief, coastal plain. Two periods of channel incision are inferred, based mainly 
on seismic records. The paleodrainage paths mapped from the seismic records can be connected with 
those recognized by previous studies on the adjacent continental shelf and slope. Upstream, the 
drainage incised mainly into the coastal prism deposited during previous sea-level highstand events. 
The paleodrainage network, recognized on the coastal plain and continental shelf, represents a river-
shelf system, linking the drainage basin to the depositional settings on the marginal basin, bypassing 
the continental shelf exposed during a forced regression event. The drainage incised into the coastal 
plain and continental shelf of Rio Grande do Sul played an important role in the basin-margin 
architecture, facies distribution and accommodation during the Quaternary sea-level fluctuations.

INTRODUCTION 
 

The decisive influence of sea-level 
variations on the geological evolution of marginal 
basins around the world has long been recognized. The 
present basin margin morphologies and architectures 
are mainly the result of a series of glacial-interglacial 
cycles (MEIJER, 2002). 

Several studies suggest that the Quaternary 
evolution of the coastal plain and adjacent continental 
shelf of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) is mainly determined 
by the sea-level (CORRÊA, 1986, 1995, 1996; 
DILLENBURG et al., 2004; MARTINS et al., 1985, 
1996; TOMAZELLI; VILLWOCK, 2000; 
VILLWOCK; TOMAZELLI, 1995; VILLWOCK et 
al., 1986). 



                             

 

The sedimentary systems along the southern 
Brazilian marginal basins have been strongly affected 
by sea-level cycles. The present physiography of the 
coastal plain and continental shelf is mainly the result 
of Quaternary high-frequency, glacio-eustatic, sea-
level changes. 

The close association between sea level 
variation and fluvial incision on continental shelves 
has been demonstrated in several papers (BLUM; 
TÖRNQVIST, 2000; CONTI; FURTADO, 2009; 
HORI et al., 2002; KOSS et al., 1994). Basically, 
during an event of relative fall in sea-level, the 
channels and valleys formed by fluvial systems extend 
their limits basinward, widening the exposed shelf and 
eroding into underlying strata. The exposed shelf (the 
“newly formed coastal plain”), usually composed of 
unconsolidated sediments, is incised by valleys linking 
the drainage basin onland to the depositional settings 

on the marginal basin offshore. The coastal prism, 
deposited during a previous sea-level highstand event, 
is usually deeply dissected.  

Tracking the spatial distribution of the 
paleodrainage network and the unconformities, 
produced by such erosional processes during a fall in 
sea-level, is useful to improve the current models of 
sequence stratigraphy proposed for margin-shelf 
settings. 

In this paper the paleodrainage systems are 
mapped on the coastal plain and the continental shelf 
of RS (Fig. 1). The former drainage systems are 
reconstructed mainly from the paleoincisions observed 
in high-resolution seismic data. Timing of the incision 
of the paleodrainage networks is discussed. The 
geological evolution of the coastal plain and 
continental shelf of RS during the Quaternary is also 
addressed.

GEOLOGICAL OUTLINE 
 

The coastal plain of RS represents the upper 
part of the Pelotas marginal basin. Four lagoon-barrier 
type depositional systems, related to transgressive-
regressive events of the Late Quaternary period, have 
been recognized on the RS coastal plain 
(TOMAZELLI; VILLWOCK, 2000; VILLWOCK; 
TOMAZELLI, 1995). A correlation between the sea-
level highstands and major peaks of the oxygen 
isotope curve has been established by Villwock and 
Tomazelli (1995), which should confirm the 
correlation between sea level oscillations and climate 
changes (ZAZO et al., 2008). 

Although several transgressive and 
regressive events have left their distinct topographic, 
depositional, erosional and sedimentary imprint, the 
present morphology of the RS continental shelf is in 
general homogeneous. It is characterized by a smooth 
morphology with a very gentle gradient (1.3–1.4 
m/km) and an average width of 125 km. The northern 
section is narrow and homogeneous, whereas the 
southern section is wider and gently dissected. The 
usually smooth shelf morphology is interrupted, 
mainly in the south portion, by sand bodies such as 
sand waves. Associated with these sand bodies are 
elongated bioclastic deposits which have been 
interpreted as paleoshoreline indicators (CORRÊA, 
1996). The presence of marine terraces with 
considerably steeper slopes throughout the shelf has 
been interpreted as a record of periods of stabilization 
in the sea-level during the Holocene transgressive 
event (CORRÊA, 1996). 

According to Corrêa (1986), the Holocene 
transgression began approximately 17.5 ky BP, when 
the sea-level was 120 m lower than the present level. 
Before this event, the present inner shelf surface was 
subaerial coastal plain, subject to erosion and to fluvial 
incision. Beach ridges, consisting of coarse sand, were 
formed along the paleocoastline; fine sand was 
deposited on the inner shelf, whereas clay and clayey 
sand dominated the outer shelf and the upper slope. 
Around 5 ky BP, the sea was 5-6 m above the present 
level during the Holocene Climatic Optimum. During 
this phase, the drainage channels became shorter 
landwards and fine sediments were deposited in 
deeper waters, while reworking transgressive sands in 
the coastal zone. Paleocoastline stabilization is marked 
by bioclastic gravels and heavy mineral 
concentrations. 

Nowadays, the RS coastal plain is 
characterized by wide lowlands covering an area 
around 33,000 sq km, bordering highlands to the west. 
The main physiographic feature is the Patos Lagoon, 
with 240 km length and an average width of 40 km 
(Fig. 1). The lagoonal deposits consist of marginal 
sands and muddy sediments (up to 6 m thick) in the 

interior of the lagoon (TOLDO-JR et al., 2000). The 
lagoon receives a great river discharge and transports 
it to the Atlantic Ocean through a single tidal inlet near 
the city of Rio Grande. No evidence for severe storms 
in this area during the Holocene has been reported, and 
the tidal amplitude averages &amp;lt;40 cm. 
 

METHODS 
 

This study is primarily based on the analysis 
of seismic reflection profiles obtained in the Patos 
Lagoon. It focuses on the identification and mapping 
of the former drainage network that dissected the area 
of study. The established geological framework for the 
coastal and marine geology of southern Brazil has 
corroborated the achievement of some of the goals set 
for this study. 

A 3.5 kHz seismic-reflection data survey 
was performed in the Patos Lagoon (Fig. 1; profiles 1 
to 12) in December, 2002. The cruise was carried out 
aboard the research vessel Larus of the Fundação 
Universidade do Rio Grande. The positioning of the 
seismic lines was determined by a DGPS system 
linked to the subbottom profiler system. The seismic 
equipment used was a GeoAcoustics subbottom 
profiler, consisting of a GeoPulse transmitter (model 
5430A), a GeoPulse receiver (model 5210A), a 132B 
transducer array (4 mount), a graphic recorder EPC-
GSP-1086, a GeoPro processor system and seismic 
data acquisition software. The transducers were 
mounted on a plate at the end of a vertical, gimbaled 
staff supported by a mounting pad fixed over the 
vessel´s side. The dataset was saved in analogical and 
digital formats. 

In addition, seismic sections (3.5 and 7 kHz) 
obtained at the Patos Lagoon during a former research 
cruise (TOLDO-JR et al., 2000) were analyzed (Fig. 1; 
dashed line seismic sections). The data survey was 
performed using a shallow seismic system RTT 1000, 
from Raytheon, consisting of a 719 C RTT recorder, a 
3.5/7 kHz transducer, and a PTR 106 C transceiver. 
The analysis and interpretation of the seismic data 
were based on the configuration of the reflectors, 
according to the general concepts established in the 
field of seismic stratigraphy (MITCHUM-JR. et al., 
1977). We assumed velocity of sound in sediments of 
1,650 m/s to evaluate the thickness of the sedimentary 
packages by converting travel times into meters 
(JONES, 1999). 
 

RESULTS 
 

The analysis of the seismic profiles reveals 
the architectural elements that make up the 
sedimentary pile deposited in the Patos Lagoon during 
the Late Quaternary. These elements are identified

through the configurations of the reflectors, namely 
external geometry, lateral termination and internal 
configuration. 

Well delineated paleochannels, or other 
features indicating their occurrence, were identified in 
almost all the seismic profiles analyzed. However, the 
records of the 3.5 kHz seismic profiles 1 to 12 (Fig. 1) 
provided a better resolution and deeper penetration 
than the 3.5 and 7 kHz sections obtained previously 
(dashed line seismic section in Figure 1). 

Systematic mapping of the seismic surfaces 
makes clear the presence of two distinct, well-defined 
cut-and-fill paleochannel systems (Fig. 2). The older 

paleochannel system is buried by a sedimentary unit 
up to 8 m thick (Figs 2B, D), whereas the younger 
paleochannel system is blanked by a centimeter-thin 
veneer of sediments (Figs 2C, E; Fig. 3). The seismic 
reflectors of the older paleochannel system are 
intersected by the reflectors of the younger, indicating 
the relative timing of incision, i.e., the incision and 
infilling of the older paleochannel system (Fig. 2A). 
The uppermost reflectors of the seismic facies 
representing the sedimentary infill of the younger 
paleochannel system are truncated in some places by 
reflectors attributed to the modern lagoon bottom (Figs 
2C, E).

Profile 2 is about 38 km long and was 
obtained roughly parallel to the eastern border of the 
Patos Lagoon, in a southwest-to-northeast direction. 
The water depths along the profile are around 6 m, 
except at the southwestern and northeastern ends of 
the profile, where the water depths decrease to around 
5 m, due to the proximity of the lagoonal margin. 

Various buried channels of the older system 
are detected in profile 2 (Fig. 2A). They are some 
hundred of meters wide and the sedimentary infill 
reaches thicknesses up to 15 m. Paleochannels are 
infilled with seismic facies units filling a negative 
relief in the underlying strata. The underlying 
reflections are mainly parallel to subparallel and 
continuous to discontinuous, showing truncation along 
the continuous basal surface of the channels. The 
upper reflectors of the seismic facies filling up these 
paleochannels are truncated by a well-marked, strong 
and continuous reflector of the overlying strata. The 
overlying strata are composed of continuous, parallel 
to subparallel, gently dipping reflectors (Figs 2B, D). 

The largest paleochannel in profile 2 is about 
1.5 km wide and the sedimentary channel-fill 
sediments are at least 20 m thick (Figs 2C, E). This 
large paleochannel is included in the younger group of 
paleochannels. The underlying strata are mainly 
composed of seismic facies with parallel and 
subparallel, continuous to discontinuous reflectors 
(Fig. 2E). Truncation of the seismic reflectors marks 

the basal surface of the channel. The lowermost 
channel fill seismic facies presents dipping reflectors 
throughout the entire channel. Discontinuous, weak 
and strong reflectors delineate mounded onlap, 
prograded, and complex fill patterns onlapping the 
underlying unconformity (Fig. 2E, inset i). A 
laminated to acoustically transparent seismic facies 
delineates a mounded onlap pattern (Fig. 2E, inset ii). 
The seismic facies of insets iii and iv are similar. 
However, the upper fill seismic facies unit presents 
more undulating, stronger to opaque, reflectors. The 
youngest seismic-facies unit is marked by acoustically 
laminated deposits onlapping the underlying unit at a 
very low angle. The reflectors are continuous, parallel 
to semiparallel, dipping gently to the lagoon interior. 
In some places the upper reflectors are truncated by 
the lagoon bottom reflector (Fig. 2E, inset v). As 
indicated by the radiocarbon dating 
(WESCHENFELDER et al., 2008b), the main period 
of sedimentary filling of this channel is Holocene. 

Profile 7 (N-S) extends for over 10 km. It 
was obtained along the eastern lagoon margin, in a 
north-to-south direction. The water along the profile is 
around 5 m deep except at the southern end of the 
profile, where the ship crossed a lagoon terrace 
covered by about 2 m of water. Various paleochannels 
were mapped on this seismic line. The base of the 
channels is delineated by a strong reflector truncating 
the reflectors of the underlying strata (Figs 3A, B).

The most prominent paleochannel is about 2 
km wide and the sedimentary filling is at least 20 m 
thick (Figs 3A, B). This large paleochannel is adjacent 
to another one of the same magnitude, located at the 
south end of the profile. Further, various 
paleochannels with widths ranging from a few meters 
to hundreds of meters and with depths ranging from 
approximately 1 to 4 m are present throughout the 
profile (Fig. 3B). In some places the uppermost 
reflectors are truncated by reflectors attributed to the 
lagoon bottom, similar to those found in a previously 
mentioned paleochannel of profile 2. 

Profile I was obtained across the active 
intralagoonal delta of the Camaquã River, in a 
southwest-to-northeast direction. The southwestern 
end of the profile reveals the presence of a wide buried 
paleochannel, more than 1 km wide and up to 7 m 
deep. Profile I showed a larger buried channel at its 
center, but the presence of gas-rich sediments formed 
an acoustic blanking layer, which hindered its exact 
delineation (Fig. 4). 

Profile II was also recorded on the western 
border of the lagoon, in a southeast-to-northwest 
direction. It is located about 15 km south of the 

present mouth of the Camaquã River (Fig. 1). Water 
depths range from about 3 m at the northwest end of 
the profile to 5 m at the southeast end of the profile. 
The records show a wide (up to 2 km) and deep 
(around 10 m) buried paleovalley flanked by a strong, 
irregular and undulating, well-marked reflector. The 
buried paleochannel is infilled in the middle reaches 
by a thick sedimentary unit, which presents no clear 
evidences of channel cutting (e.g., by the Camaquã 
channel) (Fig. 5). 

It is worthwhile to mention that acoustic 
anomalies, due to gas-rich sediments are present in 
some sectors of the seismic profiles. The gas trapped 
appears as a strong reflection, somewhat masking the 
underlying reflectors (JUDD; HOVLAND, 1992; 
WESCHENFELDER et al., 2006). The profiles far 
from the lagoon margin are especially strongly 
affected by this acoustic phenomenon (e.g., profiles 8, 
10 and 12), contrasting with those situated near the 
margin (e.g., profiles 2, 7 and 11). Moreover, the 
shallow water depths contributed to low signal 
penetration in some sectors, associated with the 
recurrent multiple reflector of the lagoon bottom.

DISCUSSION 
 
 

Coastal morphology, prior to a transgression 
event plays a decisive role in coastal evolution and 
hence on the actual coastal configuration (BELKNAP; 
KRAFT, 1985). The present continental shelf of RS 
shows a homogeneous and smooth morphology with a 
very gentle gradient, broadly reflecting the regional 
former coastal plain topography prior to the Holocene 
postglacial marine transgression (DILLENBURG et 
al., 2000). 

The preservation potential of the Holocene 
sedimentary records along the north and central coast 
of RS was addressed by DILLENBURG et al. (2000). 
The study shows, for the north coast that the pre-
existing Pleistocene morphology was deeply dissected 
by fluvial channels before the Holocene marine 
transgression, contrasting with evidence of a smooth 
and dissection-free morphology in the central coast 
near the town of Bojuru. The study also indicates that 
the depth of shoreface erosion ranges from 3 to 10 m 
for the present RS northern coast. This value was 
estimated assuming a transgressing sea in a shoreface 
retreatment model (REINSON, 1992). 

Our seismic data indicate that the central 
part of the Rio Grande do Sul coastal plain was deeply 
dissected during Late Pleistocene lowstands by fluvial 
channels prior to transgressive events 
(WESCHENFELDER et al., 2005, 2008a,b). Two 
paleochannel systems can be established in the area of 
study. The older paleochannel system is relatively 
deeply buried by a sedimentary package up to 8 m 
thick (e.g., Figs 2B, d). A younger paleochannel 
system practically crops out on the bottom of the Patos 
Lagoon (e.g., Figs 2C, E; Fig. 3). The channel filling 
of the younger drainage system is Holocene, as 
indicated by radiocarbon dating (WESCHENFELDER 
et al., 2008b). The channel incisions are thus related to 
the Last Glacial Maximum (Marine Isotope Stage) 
(MIS 2) of the Late Pleistocene, when the sea-level 
fell to a depth of 120 m below its present position. The 
older paleochannel system formation and filling 
would, therefore, be related to a previous regressive-
transgressive event of the Pleistocene, e.g. MIS 6 
(WESCHENFELDER et al., 2008a). 

The two paleochannel systems just 
mentioned (Late Pleistocene; Latest Pleistocene-
Holocene) were mapped from seismic records. The 
drainage lines were extended through the continental 
shelf to the shelf edge by means of morphostructural 
data (CORRÊA, 1996; MARTINS et al., 1996). 
Landwards, the paleodrainage lines were linked with 
the main present river courses (Fig. 6). 

The Camaquã River is the main drainage 
source entering the midwestern part of the Patos 
Lagoon. The upper and middle courses of the main 

rivers reaching the coastal plain of RS (e.g., the 
Piratini, Camaquã and Jacuí Rivers) (Fig. 1) have 
maintained a relatively fixed position during the 
Quaternary. They drain a stable Precambrian basement 
and, from Porto Alegre northwards, the Paleozoic to 
Mesozoic volcano-sedimentary sequences of the 
Paraná basin. However, the lower courses of these 
rivers have drained an unconsolidated sedimentary 
coastal plain. 

The lower course of the Camaquã River has 
cut mainly into alluvial fans of the Pliocene and 
Pleistocene. The onset of channel incision probably 
occurred during the Early Pleistocene. It has been 
excavated principally since the Middle Pleistocene and 
especially during the 130 m sea-level lowstand that 
occurred during the forced regression related to the 
maximum of the Wisconsin Glaciation. During the 
transgressive episodes following the glaciations, the 
Camaquã incised valley was a depositional setting for 
sediments from coastal and continental environments, 
deposited in a multitude of sedimentation cycles. 

A paleochannel inlet between the Patos 
Lagoon and the Atlantic Ocean was hypothesized by 
Toldo-Jr. et al. (1991, 2000). According to this 
hypothesis, the narrow and shallow reentrance on the 
lagoon coast near Bojuru (called `Barra Falsa 
channel`) is a morphological inheritance from a 
Holocene inlet. When the axis of this inlet is extended 
into the lagoon it intercepts profile 2, just where a 
prominent paleochannel occurs (Figs 2c, e). Hence, the 
entrance to the lagoon near Bojuru most probably 
represents a morphological feature left over from a 
former wide channel connecting the Patos Lagoon to 
the Atlantic Ocean. The Holocene channel filling 
sequence was determined by sea-level changes, 
climatic oscillations and coastal barrier-inlet 
development (WESCHENFELDER et al., 2008b). 

Two placer deposits, located backshore, 
occur in the area of study. The placer located between 
the marine coastline and the town of Bojuru, known as 
the Bojuru placer, has been related to ancient deltaic 
sediments of the Camaquã River, which were 
reworked by coastal processes during sea-level 
highstands (DILLENBURG et al., 2004). The second 
placer is located at approximately the same latitude as 
the place where profile 1 intercepts profile 2, 
presenting similar characteristics to the Bojuru placer. 
We have, therefore, envisaged two Late 
Pleistocene/Holocene paths related to the former 
Camaquã River. They were delineated by linking the 
present river course to the paleochannel incisions 
mapped out from the seismic records and, continuing 
basinward, across the adjacent continental shelf (Fig. 
6). 

The paleochannels mapped out from profile 
7 probably correspond to the former course of the 
Jacuí River (Fig. 3). In profile 7 the main 

                   WESCHENFELDER ET AL.: QUATERNARY PALEOCHANNELS IN SOUTHERN BRAZIL                     41 
 



                             

 

paleochannels cut through the entire recorded 
sedimentary pile, similar to the sequence of events 
recorded in the Camaquã paleochannel in profile 2 
(Figs 2C, E). The smaller paleochannels occurring in 
profiles 2 and 7, usually cutting only the uppermost 
strata, could be tributaries of the main river courses or 
independent smaller drainage courses. 

The Camaquã and Jacuí rivers excavated 
deep, wide incisions in the coastal plain, triggered by 
the last forced regression event (Wisconsin Glaciation) 
(Last Glacial Maximum). These channels probably 
represented an important river-shelf bypassing system, 
linking the drainage basin to the west with the 
depositional settings to the east.

In general terms, the RS coastal plain and 
the adjacent continental shelf were deeply dissected 
before the transgressive events (ABREU; CALLIARI, 
2005). The paleochannels that dissected the shelf 
before the transgressive events can be linked through 
the coastal plain to the present river network inland. 
The paleodrainage map of Figure 6 represents former 
river-shelf systems, linking the drainage basin inland 
to the depositional settings in the Pelotas marginal 
basin. 

The bypassing discharge of the younger 
drainage system (Latest Pleistocene/Holocene in 
Figure 6) fed a complex of delta systems installed on 
the shelf edge of RS during the sea-level lowstand that 
lasted until the end of the last glaciation at around 17.5 
ky (ANGULO; LESSA, 1997; DILLENBURG et al., 
2004). The Holocene transgressive post-glacial event 
drowned the Pleistocene incised paleochannels, 
infilling them and, finally, closing the inlets formerly 
existing between the Patos Lagoon and the Atlantic 
Ocean. The contours of the Patos Lagoon were thus 
established and there remains the single inlet to the 
south. Presently, the lagoon captures a significant river 
discharge and conducts it to the ocean through a large 
inlet near the city of Rio Grande. 
 

CONCLUSIONS 
 

The continuous seismic-reflection profiles, 
obtained at the Patos Lagoon, allowed us to recognize 
the shallow architectural elements that built up the 
sedimentary pile accumulated on the Rio Grande do 
Sul coastal plain. 

Incision networks deeply dissected the 
coastal plain and the continental shelf before the 
installation of the subsequent postglacial Holocene 
transgressive events. The paleodrainage networks 
represented river-shelf systems, linking the drainage 
basin inland and the depositional setting of the Pelotas 
marginal basin, bypassing the continental shelf 
exposed by forced regression events. 

The two drainage systems identified through 
the seismic records were formed during two distinct 
periods. The sedimentary filling of the younger 
paleochannel system is Holocene, as indicated by 
absolute radiocarbon dating. Its incision is related to 
the last forced regression of the end of the Pleistocene 
period. The incision and the filling of the older 
channel system are most probably related to a previous 
transgression-regression event of the Late Pleistocene. 

The drainage network incised into the Rio 
Grande do Sul coastal plain and the adjacent 
continental shelf played an important role in the basin-
margin´s architecture, the facies distribution and the 
spatial accommodation that occurred during the 
Quaternary.
