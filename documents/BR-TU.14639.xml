Reproductive biology of the Neotropical electric fish

Brachyhypopomus draco (Teleostei: Hypopomidae) from southern Brazil

Andrea B. Schaan, Júlia Giora and Clarice B. Fialho

The reproductive biology of a population of the weakly electric fish Brachyhypopomus draco from southern Brazil is described.
Information is provided on the establishment of the reproductive period in this species and its relations with environmental
and feeding factors, as well as on the absolute and relative fecundities, spawning type, sex ratio and sexual dimorphism. The
species exhibits a relatively long reproductive period, a relative fecundity of 0.173 oocytes per mg of female total weight, and
fractional spawning. The sex ratio did not differ from 1:1 during all sampled months. Sexual dimorphism related to hypertrophy
of the male’s distal portion of caudal filament was observed and males grew to greater lengths than females. Male gonadosomatic
index (GSI) was significantly related to water depth, oxygen saturation and temperature. Female GSI was significantly related
to water depth and hepatosomatic index.

Descreve-se a biologia reprodutiva de uma população do peixe elétrico Brachyhypopomus draco do sul do Brasil. São
apresentadas informações a respeito do período reprodutivo estabelecido e suas relações com fatores ambientais e alimentares,
bem como a fecundidade absoluta e relativa, tipo de desova, proporção sexual e dimorfismo sexual. A espécie apresentou um
período reprodutivo relativamente longo, uma fecundidade relativa de 0,173 ovócitos por mg de peso total da fêmea e uma
desova do tipo parcelada. A proporção sexual encontrada foi de 1:1 durante todos os meses amostrados. Dimorfismo sexual
relacionado com a hipertrofia da porção distal do filamento caudal dos machos e com o tamanho total dos espécimes - machos
atingindo tamanhos maiores do que as fêmeas - foi encontrado. O IGS dos machos foi significativamente relacionado com a
profundidade da água, a saturação de oxigênio e a temperatura; o IGS das fêmeas foi significativamente relacionado com a
profundidade da água e o índice hepatossomático.

Introduction

The order Gymnotiformes is restricted to Neotropical
freshwaters, occurring from southern Mexico to Argentina,
and to the Caribbean island of Trinidad (Mago-Leccia, 1978;
Crampton &amp;amp; Albert, 2006). Representatives of this order can
be found in several aquatic habitats, including river channels,
floodplains, flooded forests, forest streams, waterfalls,
swamps, coastal creeks and estuarine reaches (Crampton &amp;amp;
Albert, 2006). The family Hypopomidae is known from the
continental waters of all South American countries except Chile,
ranging from río de La Plata in Argentina to rio Tuira in Panama
(Albert, 2001). The genus Brachyhypopomus is the most widely
distributed among the hypopomids, reaching the same
geographic limits as the family (Albert &amp;amp; Crampton, 2003).

Reproduction represents one of the most important
aspects of the biology of a species, the maintenance of viable
populations depending on its success (Suzuki &amp;amp; Agostinho,
1997). Although studies on the reproductive cycle of fishes
have been extensively conducted world-wide, Neotropical
region has received much less attention (Barbieri &amp;amp; Barbieri,
1985). For gymnotiform species, few data concerning
reproductive aspects are available (Kirschbaum, 1979; Barbieri
&amp;amp; Barbieri, 1982, 1983a, 1983b, 1984a, 1984b, 1985; Hagedorn,
1988; Assunção &amp;amp; Schwassmann, 1995; Kirschbaum &amp;amp;
Schugardt, 2002; Silva et al., 2003; Quintana et al., 2004). In
southern Brazil, studies on the reproductive biology of
gymnotiform species have been undertaken by Cognato &amp;amp;
Fialho (2006) on Gymnotus aff. carapo, by Giora &amp;amp; Fialho
(2009) concerning Eigenmannia trilineata, and by Giora (2008)



Reproductive biology of Brachyhypopomus draco738

concerning two Brachyhypopomus species, all in the
protected area of Parque Estadual de Itapuã.

The aim of this study was to characterize the reproductive
biology of a population of Brachyhypopomus draco, recently
described by Giora et al. (2008), from southern Brazil by
determining the reproductive period and its relations with
environmental and feeding factors, and to determine the
absolute and relative fecundities, spawning type, sex ratio
and sexual dimorphism of the species.

Material and Methods

The specimens of Brachyhypopomus draco were sampled
monthly from September 2003 to August 2004 in lagoa Verde,
in the Parque Estadual de Itapuã (Rio Grande do Sul State),
which is situated in the laguna dos Patos system. Lagoa Verde
(30°22’52’’S 51°01’25’’W) has an area of approximately 4 ha
and a maximum depth of 1 m. The site shows a predominantly
muddy substratum, great amount of floating plants and plant
material in decomposition.

Fishes were sampled using a dip net under floating
vegetation and an electric fish finder (Crampton et al., 2007).
The specimens were fixed in the field in 10% formalin solution.
Water temperature, depth, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen
were recorded at the time and place of collection. Rainfall
data were obtained from the Meteorology District of Porto
Alegre and photoperiod was obtained with the SkyMap Pro
9.0 software , by correlating dates of collection with collecting
place coordinates.

In the laboratory, fishes were preserved in 70% ethanol.
Total length (Lt) in millimeters and total weight (Wt) in grams
were measured, and the specimens were dissected to record
liver (Wl), stomach (Ws) and gonad (Wg) weight. Voucher
specimens are deposited in the fish collection of the
Departamento de Zoologia, Universidade Federal do Rio
Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil (UFRGS 5719 and UFRGS
6635).

Stomach repletion index (RI), hepatosomatic index (HSI)
and gonadosomatic index (GSI) were estimated following the
formula adapted from Santos (1978). These indexes represent
the proportion of organ weight to total individual weight: RI
= 100 x Ws / Wt; HSI = 100 x Wl / Wt; and GSI = 100 x Wg /
Wt. Ws corresponds to stomach weight, Wl to liver weight,
Wg to gonadal weight and Wt to total weight.

The reproductive period for males and females was
established through the analysis of monthly variation of mean
GSI values. A multiple regression with analysis of variance
(ANOVA) (Zar, 1999) was applied to investigate relations
between abiotic factors (rainfall, photoperiod, temperature,
conductivity, depth, and oxygen saturation) and GSI, as well
as between feeding factors (RI and HSI) and GSI. To avoid
tendentious results in the multiple regression analysis, a test
of correlation was applied to the abiotic and feeding factors
tested, which showed no correlation between them.

Absolute fecundity was estimated by counting all
vitellogenic oocytes present in the ovaries of 10 females with

the highest GSI values. The relative fecundity was determined
by the number of vitellogenic oocytes counted per female
milligram of total weight (Adebisi, 1987). For the determination
of the spawning type, the same gonads selected for fecundity
analysis were used. A sub-sample of 150 oocytes was removed
from each selected gonad and the largest possible oocyte
diameter was obtained by examination under a stereomicroscope
equipped with an ocular micrometer (Vazzoler, 1996).

The sex ratio was determined by the distribution of male
and female frequency during the sample period. The c2 test
(with a confidence limit of p &amp;lt;0.01) was applied to determine
the existence of significant differences between the number
of males and females. The distribution of relative frequencies
of males and females in different total length classes was
analyzed to observe sexual dimorphism related to total length.

The distal portion of the caudal filament of some males
was vertically broadened and laterally compressed. To
determine a possible relation between this sexually dimorphic
feature and the established reproductive period, the greatest
depth found in the last 15 mm of the filament was measured,
and its percentage in relation to the total length was calculated
in every male sampled. These values were grouped in
modification classes (level one, from 0 to 1.5%; level two,
from 1.51% to 2.5%; level three, from 2.51% to 3.5%) and their
relative frequencies were analyzed monthly by a ?2 test (with
a confidence limit of p &amp;lt;0.05). Individuals with indications of
predation or regeneration were excluded from this analysis.

Results

A total of 300 specimens - 150 females with total length
ranging from 55.5 to 176.8 mm and 150 males ranging from
68.2 to 212.3 mm - were analyzed. The estimated reproductive
period lasted from August to December for females and from
July to December for males (Fig. 1).

The GSI of B. draco males did not exhibit a significant
relation with the feeding indexes analyzed (IR and HSI),
whereas the GSI of females showed significant positive
relation with HSI (Table 1). Among the six abiotic factors that
were considered, temperature, oxygen saturation, and water
depth positively influenced male GSI, while female GSI was
affected only by water depth (Table 1). Monthly data of RI
and HSI variation are presented in Figs. 2 and 3 respectively.
Monthly data of water temperature, conductivity, depth,
dissolved oxygen, rainfall, and photoperiod for the study site
are summarized in Fig. 4.

The absolute fecundity of the species analyzed showed
an average value of 935.8 vitellogenic oocytes (ranging from
576 to 1391 oocytes) for females with total length from 113.9
to 174 mm (Table 2). The average relative fecundity was
estimated as 0.17 vitellogenic oocytes per mg total weight
(Table 2). Analysis of the absolute frequency distribution of
oocyte diameter conforms to that of a species with
synchronous oocyte development in more than two groups,
and with fractional spawning, the species being estimated to
spawn at least twice during a reproductive period (Fig. 5). A

high frequency of pre-vitellogenic (reserve) oocytes can be
observed. These are the smallest germinative cells that are
visible under a stereomicroscope, have a large and central
nucleus, and contain no yolk vesicles. The reserve oocytes
will only mature in the next reproductive period, but are
followed by oocyte stores in successive maturation stages
(Fig. 5), which are released at different times in the current
reproductive period. The presence of reserve oocytes and more
than one store of oocytes in successive developmental stages
provide evidence that B. draco is an iteroparous species.

The sex ratio established for the B. draco studied population
was 1:1 in each month, as well as in the global sample. Sexual
dimorphism related to total body length was determined for the
species, with males growing to greater lengths than females
(Fig. 6). The largest male and female sampled had total lengths
of 212.3 mm and 176.8 mm, respectively. Males of B. draco with
hypertrophy of the distal portion of caudal filament - vertical
broadening and lateral compression, which give the caudal
filament a paddle-like shape - were sampled during all months
of the year, with male caudal filament depth ranging from 0.96
to 6.88 mm, representing 1.14% to 3.47% of total length. Caudal
filaments grouped in level one (n = 32) were found in all months
of the year, except November and December, but with higher
frequency in April and July (Fig. 7). Caudal filaments in level
two (n = 94) were found in all sampled months, showing a
higher frequency in November (Fig. 7). Filaments in level three
(n = 7) were found from August to January except in September
and November (Fig. 7). The ?2 test indicated a significant
difference between the three levels during the whole sampled
year, except in February and July, with the highest values
occurring from August to December and in March (Table 3).
No individuals with level three filaments were found from
February to July of the year studied, suggesting a regression
of the caudal filament hypertrophy after the reproductive
period months (Fig. 7).

Discussion

Reproductive processes in fishes are controlled by
endogenous and exogenous aspects; endogenous aspects
being represented by hormonal metabolism and exogenous
by environmental characters, which are seasonally variable
(Jobling, 1995). Fish species need particular environmental
conditions during the reproductive period to guarantee the
growth and survival of new generation individuals (Vazzoler,
1996). Brachyhypopomus draco has a seasonal reproductive
period occurring from August to December for females and
from July to December for males, periods that corresponds to
the middle of winter till the end of spring in the subtropical
southern hemisphere.

The reproductive cycles of gymnotiform species from the
tropical area of the Neotropical region have been related to
environmental aspects involved in the changes between
rainy and dry seasons, where breeding occurs when the
increase in rainfall determines high water levels and low
water conductivities (Hopkins, 1974a, 1974b; Kirschbaum,
1975, 1979, 1984, 2000; Schwassmann, 1976; Hagedorn, 1988;
Kirschbaum &amp;amp; Schugardt, 2002). On the other hand, studies
with gymnotiform species, in regions close to the southern
boundary of their continental distribution, show the relation
of reproductive periods with the increase in temperature

(Silva et al., 1999; Ardanaz et al., 2001; Silva et al., 2002;
Quintana et al., 2004), in photoperiod (Giora &amp;amp; Fialho, 2009)
or in both temperature and photoperiod (Silva et al., 2003;
Cognato &amp;amp; Fialho, 2006). For the B. draco population from
lagoa Verde, the male reproductive cycle showed a positive
relation with temperature, but no relation was found for
photoperiod.

For the B. draco population studied, male and female
reproductive periods were related to water depth, male
reproductive period being also related to oxygen saturation.
These mentioned abiotic factors are linked to environmental
changes caused by rainfall suggesting that breeding occurs
during the rainiest period of the year. However, the rainfall
data obtained for the study area did not show a statistically
significant relation with male and female reproductive periods.
Studies at Parque Estadual de Itapuã concerning gymnotiform
species have established reproductive periods occurring from
October to February for Eigenmannia trilineata (Giora &amp;amp;
Fialho, 2009) and from November to March for Gymnotus aff.
carapo (Cognato &amp;amp; Fialho, 2006). With this mind, the low
rainfall rates and water depth observed during the months of



Reproductive biology of Brachyhypopomus draco742

January through April of the year studied might have induced
the regression of male and female gonads and might have
determined the anticipation of the end of the B. draco
population breeding season.

The number of reproductive episodes before death is a
key life-history character, and biologists have long considered
the distinctions between life histories with a single
reproductive episode (semelparity) and those with multiple
episodes (iteroparity) to be particularly important (Young,
1981). The B. draco population studied showed an iteroparous
life-history strategy, agreeing with the results that have been
obtained for other species of Gymnotiformes (Barbieri &amp;amp;
Barbieri, 1982; Assunção &amp;amp; Schwassmann, 1995; Kirschbaum
&amp;amp; Schugardt, 2002; Quintana et al., 2004; Cognato &amp;amp; Fialho,
2006; Giora &amp;amp; Fialho, 2009; Giora, 2008).

Iteroparous species of fishes frequently show a negative
relation between female HSI and GSI due to the allocation of
energy from the liver to the oocytes that are being produced
(Jobling, 1995). However, for B. draco females a positive
relation between these indexes has been established. Marked
differences in fecundity between species often reflect
different reproductive strategies; within a given species,
fecundity can vary as a result of different adaptation to
environmental habitats (Wooton, 1984). The absolute and
relative fecundities established for B. draco are slightly lower
than those determined for the species Brachyhypopomus
bombilla and Brachyhypopomus gauderio (Giora, 2008),
which were found to be 587.33 oocytes and 0.21 oocytes per
mg of total weight, and 589.44 oocytes and 0.20 oocytes per
mg of total weight, respectively. Two other studies with
Gymnotiformes from southern Brazil have shown slightly
higher relative fecundities for the species, these being 0.20
oocytes per mg of total weight for Gymnotus aff. carapo
(Cognato &amp;amp; Fialho, 2006) and 0.27 for E. trilineata (Giora &amp;amp;
Fialho, 2009). According to Vazzoler (1996), fecundity depends,
as a last resort, on the coelomatic cavity capacity of lodge
ripe oocytes and of oocyte size. As a consequence of the
peculiar anatomy of gymnotiform fishes, which results in a
short coelomatic cavity that cannot lodge a great number of
oocytes, a lower relative fecundity is expected in comparison
with Characiformes and Siluriformes species (Cognato &amp;amp;
Fialho, 2006). Notwithstanding, more studies concerning
relative fecundity data are needed for a better comparison
among species of Gymnotiformes and between these and non-
gymnotiform fishes.

Considering that fecundity depends on fish total length,
fractional spawning represents a procedure through which
species can increase the number of oocytes produced during
one reproductive season to a much higher number than that
predicted considering their size (Vazzoler, 1996). The
gymnotiform short coelomatic cavity and relatively low
fecundity can be the determinants for the establishment of a
fractional spawning reproductive strategy by these fishes,
as a way of increasing the amount of oocytes released
throughout the reproductive period. Fractional spawning has
also been reported as the strategy adopted by all gymnotiform

species studied up until now (Barbieri &amp;amp; Barbieri, 1982;
Assunção &amp;amp; Schwassmann, 1995; Kirschbaum &amp;amp; Schugardt,
2002; Quintana et al., 2004; Cognato &amp;amp; Fialho, 2006; Giora &amp;amp;
Fialho, 2009; Giora, 2008).

Sexual dimorphism is a common phenomenon, and there
is a great variety of ecological reasons for its origin and
maintenance, such as sexual selection and differentiation of
reproductive roles (Cox-Fernandes, 1998). Brachyhypopomus
draco showed sexual dimorphism related to fish total length -
with males growing to greater lengths than females - as well
as being related to morphology of the caudal filament, which
carries the electric organ. Comparing the monthly variation of
male GSI and the frequency distribution of caudal filament
depth levels, it is possible to conclude that mature males
undergo hypertrophy of the distal portion of caudal filament
during the reproductive period, after which this structure
regresses until the caudal filament resembles that of females
and juveniles. This was also corroborated by the ?2  statistical
test, with modification levels appearing to be significantly
different during almost all the year sampled, especially in the
reproductive period, showing no significant differences
during the month before and after the reproductive period
established, when fishes are probably going through the major
modifications of the caudal filament. Modifications in the
mature male caudal filament, e.g., broadening, compression,
and/or elongation, have been frequently reported for
Brachyhypopomus species (Hagedorn &amp;amp; Carr, 1985;
Hagedorn, 1988; Hopkins et al., 1990; Rapp-Py-Daniel &amp;amp; Cox-
Fernandes, 2005; Giora, 2008). According to Hopkins (1999),
for pulse fishes such as Brachyhypopomus, the energy
expenditure of electric sign increases with the power and
duration of a single EOD generated. Besides that, the same
author stated that males that generate longer-duration EODs
suffer a drop in the peak amplitude of the discharge,
compensating for this drop by growing their tails longer and
thicker, so that they can generate greater voltage and current.
With this mind, females would choose males for mating on
the basis of EODs that have demanding more energy for males
to produce, favoring the males with hypertrophy of the distal
portion of caudal filament.
