New nanotechnology approaches using dendrimers modified with natural polymers for 

controlling stem cells behaviour in tissue engineering strategies 

ABSTRACT. 

In the recent years, great progress has been done in the emerging field of tissue engineering. Despite 

the important advances the performance of cells-scaffold constructs, one of the several tissue 

engineering approaches, remains limited in part due to the need for optimize cell culture techniques and 

culture media. Nanocarrier systems have generated a significant amount of interest in the ex vivo cell 

maintenance, and control of the cellular fate in vivo mainly due to their internalization efficiency, drug 

loading capacity, and to favorably modulate the solubility and pharmacokinetics of drugs. Dendrimers 

are synthetic, monodispersive, spherical and highly branched macromolecules that present unique 

advantages and fulfills most requirements as carriers for drug delivery; however, it has been found that 

high generation dendrimers are often cytotoxic. Thus, in this thesis we focused our attention in this 

fundamental problem and explore the development of novel nanobiomaterials based on the grafting of 

carboxymethylchitosan (CMCht) onto low generation poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers, the so-

called CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. These macromolecular vehicles were developed to 

explore a new concept consisting on the intracellular and controlled delivery of bioactive molecules 

aimed at control stem cells functions in a more effective manner ex vivo, and maintain the cellular 

phenotype in vivo upon re-implantation. Thus, by combining nanotechnology-based systems and 

traditional tissue engineering strategies, we expect to develop a novel therapeutic solution for the 

efficient treatment of damage/diseased cells and tissues. To validate this new concept, there is the need 

to evaluate the performance of the developed nanocarriers, in vitro and in vivo.  Firstly, the uptake 

efficiency and internalization mechanism of fluorescent-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles was investigated using different cell types. Fluorescence microscopy studies revealed that 

the developed nanocarriers could be efficiently internalized, either by cell lines and primary cultures, 

after a few hours. Flow cytometry studies revealed that rat bone marrow stromal cells (RBMSCs) 

cultured in the presence of colchicine, an alkaloid that inhibits endocytosis, decreased the internalization 

of the nanoparticles. These data showed that uptake by cells was primarily via an active endocytotic 

mechanism, but not exclusively. Preliminary studies were also carried out to evaluate the possible 

applicability of the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles in the central nervous system. 

Internalization rate, cell viability and metabolic activity studies were performed using rat post-natal 

hippocampal neurons and cortical glial cells that revealed their ability for being taken up by these cells 

and its non cytotoxicity. Complementarily, dexamethasone (Dex), a glucocorticoid known to have 



- vi - 
 

important role on the proliferation and expression of osteoblastic differentiation markers, was used as a 

model drug and incorporated into the bulk of the nanoparticles. Physicochemical characterization and in 

vitro biological studies have demonstrated that the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles 

were successfully synthesized, were not cytotoxic in the range of concentration below 1 mg.mL-1 and 

promote osteogenesis (2-D system). To assess the true value of the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles systems for application in tissue engineering strategies, we use different 

biomaterials to develop a set of novel scaffolds both ceramic and polymeric or formulations. These 

scaffolds were found to be suitable for applications in bone, cartilage and osteochondral tissue 

engineering. In vitro studies have shown that combination of scaffolds, bone marrow stromal cells and 

Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles (3-D system) enhanced osteogenesis. Finally, in 

vivo studies have shown that the novel Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles may be 

beneficial as intracellular nanocarrier, supplying Dex in a regimented manner, while avoiding the need of 

culturing stem cells for long periods of time in vitro, towards promoting the osteogenic differentiation. 

Remarkably, the proposed strategy allow modulate and direct stem cells differentiation towards 

osteogenic phenotype, enhance in vivo proteoglycan extracellular matrix synthesis and promote 

superior de novo bone formation. This thesis mark the transition from the ‘proof-of-concept’ to useful 

intracellular nanocarrier tool, as the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles show promise 

for application in direct stem cell to a particular cell fate, in vitro and in vivo.

Novas abordagens da nanotecnologia recorrendo a dendrímeros modificados com polímeros 

naturais para o controlo das funções celulares de células estaminais e utilização em estratégias 

de engenharia de tecidos  

RESUMO. 

Grandes progressos têm sido feitos nos últimos tempos no emergente campo científico da engenharia 

de tecidos. No entanto, a eficiência dos sistemas células-matriz tridimensional porosa, uma das 

estratégias usadas nas abordagens em engenharia de tecidos, tem sido limitada, em parte, pela 

necessidade de se optimizarem as técnicas e os meios de cultura usados. Sistemas de nanopartículas 

para o transporte de moléculas bioactivas têm suscitado grande interesse na área da biomedicina, 

nomeadamente no que respeita à possível aplicação como suplementos em meios de cultura ex vivo, e 

no controlo das funções celulares in vivo. Isto deve-se, principalmente, à sua eficiência de 

internalização, elevada capacidade de incorporação de fármacos, e ao facto de favorecerem a 

solubilidade de moléculas hidrofóbicas e de possibilitarem a modulação da sua farmacocinética.  Os 

dendrímeros são sistemas macromoleculares sintéticos altamente ramificados que apresentam 

características únicas, tais como monodispersividade e uma estrutura esférica, e que preenchem a 

maioria dos requisitos para serem usados como veículos para a libertação controlada de fármacos. Não 

obstante, tem-se verificado que dendrímeros de elevada geração apresentam tipicamente uma 

citotoxicidade indesejada. Assim, nesta tese a atenção focou-se na resolução deste problema 

fundamental. Para tal foi explorado o desenvolvimento de novos nanobiomateriais tendo como 

estratégia a ligação química do polímero carboximetilquitosano (CMCht) a dendrímeros de 

poliamidoamina (PAMAM) de baixa geração, que se denominaram por nanopartículas de 

carboximetilquitosano/poliamidoamina (CMCht/PAMAM). Estas macromoléculas foram desenvolvidas e 

um novo conceito aplicativo foi testado relacionado com a sua aplicação em medicina regenerativa 

como veículos de libertação controlada e intracelular de moléculas bioactivas, de forma a ser possível 

controlar efectivamente as actividades celulares, tais como a proliferação e a diferenciação de células 

estaminais ex vivo, e a manutenção do fenótipo dessas mesmas células após o seu implante. Assim, 

recorrendo à nanotecnologia e a estratégias usadas na engenharia de tecidos, espera-se que seja 

possível desenvolver uma nova solução terapêutica que possa possibilitar, de uma forma eficiente, o 

tratamento de células e tecidos danificados ou que apresentem algum tipo de patologia. De forma a 

validar este novo conceito, é necessário avaliar o potencial dos nanosistemas desenvolvidos, in vitro e 

in vivo. Primeiramente, a eficiência e o mecanismo de internalização de nanopartículas de 

CMCht/PAMAM ligadas a um marcador fluorescente foram investigados, recorrendo a estudos 



- viii - 
 

celulares, in vitro. Estudos de microscopia de fluorescência revelaram que as nanopartículas 

desenvolvidas são internalizadas por diferentes tipos de células após algumas horas em cultura, 

incluindo linhas celulares e culturas primárias. Estudos envolvendo a citometria de fluxo mostraram que 

quando células multipotentes do estroma da medula óssea de rato (RBMSCs), foram cultivadas na 

presença de colchicina, um alcalóide inibidor da endocitose, exibiam menor capacidade de 

internalização das nanopartículas. Assim, a internalização das nanopartículas pelas células ocorre 

principalmente por um mecanismo de endocitose, mas que este não é o único. Foram também 

realizados estudos para determinar a taxa de internalização, viabilidade celular e actividade metabólica, 

recorrendo a neurónios isolados do hipocampo de rato pós-natais e células da glia. Estes estudos 

mostraram que as nanopartículas são internalizadas por estas células, e não afectam negativamente a 

viabilidade da cultura das células. A dexametasona (Dex), uma molécula pertencente à família dos 

glucocorticóides e conhecida pelo seu papel na modulação da proliferação e expressão  dos 

marcadores de diferenciação osteoblástica, foi usada como fármaco modelo e incorporada nas 

nanopartículas de CMCht/PAMAM. A caracterização físico-química e estudos biológicos in vitro 

demonstraram que as nanopartículas de CMCht/PAMAM carregadas com Dex foram sintetizadas com 

sucesso, não apresentaram citotoxicidade em concentrações até 1 mg.mL-1 e promoveram a 

osteogénese (sistema de cultura 2-D). Por forma a avaliar o verdadeiro potencial aplicativo das 

nanopartículas de CMCht/PAMAM carregadas com Dex em estratégias de engenharia de tecidos, 

diferentes biomateriais foram usados no desenvolvimento de estruturas tridimensionais porosas, 

incluindo cerâmicos, polímeros e formulações contendo ambos. Estas estruturas tridimensionais 

porosas mostraram-se adequadas para serem usadas em engenharia de tecidos de osso, cartilagem e 

defeitos osteocondrais. Estudos in vitro revelaram que a abordagem constituída por estruturas 

tridimensionais porosas, RBMSCs e nanopartículas de CMCht/PAMAM carregadas com Dex (sistema 

de cultura 3-D) promoveu um aumento significativo da osteogénese. Por último, estudos in vivo 

mostraram que as nanopartículas de CMCht/PAMAM carregadas com Dex são um sistema de 

libertação intracelular altamente eficiente, uma vez que possibilitaram a libertação de Dex com um perfil 

cinético adequado, permitindo assim evitar os longos períodos de cultura in vitro, necessários à 

diferenciação osteogénica de células estaminais. A estratégia proposta permite modular e direccionar a 

diferenciação das células estaminais para o fenótipo osteogénico, aumentar a síntese de 

proteoglicanos da matriz extracelular e promover a formação de osso num estado de maturação mais 

avançado. Esta tese marca a transição de “prova de conceito” para uma ferramenta aplicativa das 

nanopartículas desenvolvidas na libertação intracelular de fármacos, uma vez que as nanopartículas de 

CMCht/PAMAM carregadas com Dex se mostraram promissoras no direccionamento das células 

estaminais para um determinado fenótipo, in vitro e in vivo.

incubation for 7 days with the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles         (200 ?g.mL-1) with 

or without periodical renovations every 48 hours. MTS results showed that the metabolic activity/cell viability 

of both cell populations was not dramatically altered between the two tested groups. Similar results were also 

obtained for the total protein quantification (n=3, mean + SD, p&gt;0.05) ........................................................... 272 

Figure 3. Post-natal hippocampal neurons were able to internalize the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles (A). Initially neuronal cells disclosed a high variability on the capacity of internalizing 

the nanoparticles. However results tended to be more homogeneous after 24 hours of incubations, reaching a 

maximum of internalization (around 80-90%) after 48 hours of incubation (B). Further experiments (C-E) also 

showed that the maintenance of the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticle concentration in 

the culture medium was essential to maintain the levels of internalization. The differences observed in C-E 

were attributed to the proliferation of other cell populations within the hippocampal neuron cultures, namely 

neuroprogenitor cells (n=3; 5 fields/coverslip; mean + SD; p&lt;0.05) ............................................................... 274 

Figure 4. Internalization experiments within cortical glial cell cultures showed that astrocytes were also able to 

internalize the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles (A- after 48 hours of incubation). As it 

can be observed in (B) the internalization occurred in a gradual manner reaching a peak (around 100% of 

internalization) after 48 hours of incubation). When exposed for longer periods of time it was observed that the 



 
 

- xxx - 
 

periodical addition of nanoparticles to the culture medium was needed to stabilize the levels of internalization 

(C-E); (n=3; 5 fields/coverslip; mean + SD; p&lt;0.05) ....................................................................................... 275 

Figure 5. ligodendrocytes also reveal to be capable of internalizing the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles. (A) representative image of the nanoparticles distributed along the intracellular 

compartment. As it can be observed they were scattered around the nucleus, as well as distributed along the 

cytoplasmatic processes of the cells. Within the oligodendrocyte population it was possible to observe three 

plateau of internalization, being the highest obtained after 48 hours of incubation (B- around 80-90%).  

Similarly to what happened with neurons and astrocytes, the maintenance of the internalization levels within 

the oligodendrocyte cell population was dependent on the maintenance of the concentration of the FITC-

labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles in the culture medium (C-E); (n=3; 5 fields/coverslip; mean + 

SD; p&lt;0.05) ..................................................................................................................................................... 277 

Figure 6. Microglial cells were able to internalize FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles at a 

faster rate (A,B) when compared to other neuronal and glial cell populations. This fact cannot be dissociated 

from the phagocytotic capability of these cells. Furthermore, figure A also allowed observe that the size of the 

particles internalized by microglial cells was higher when compared to the one disclosed by other cell 

populations. Similar effects to those previously observed with other cell populations regarding the influence of 

the periodical addition of nanoparticles on the levels of internalization were also observed (C-E). This result is 

probably related with the macrophage-like behaviour of these cells ............................................................... 278 

Figure 7. Cortical glial cells cultures were treated with FDU in order to determine if the decrease on the rates 

of FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles internalization by astrocytes (A-C) and 

oligodendrocytes (D-F) was related to their cell proliferation. As it can be observed, whenever astrocyte and 

oligodendrocyte cells proliferation is impaired, the levels of internalization are not dependent on the periodical 

additions of FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles to the culture medium. This fact is an 

indication that the results observed in Figures 4 and 5 are related with the cell proliferation of the above 

referred cell populations.................................................................................................................................. 279

SHORT CURRICULUM VITAE. 

 

In 1977, Joaquim Miguel A. Oliveira was born in Caldas das Taipas - Guimarães, Portugal. Nowadays, 

he lives in Caldas das Taipas and works, as a researcher in the 3B’s Research Group, Department of 

Polymer Engineering at University of Minho, Headquarters of the European Institute of Excellence on 

Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine at Avepark, Caldas das Taipas - Guimarães, Portugal. 

This research group is directed by its founder, Professor Rui L. Reis. This group has been considered 

as excellent by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology, and is one of the associated 

units of the Institute for Biotechnology and Bioengineering. 

His background includes a graduation in Biochemistry at Faculty of Sciences of University of Porto. 

During the final year, he developed is final research project on the theme Electrochemistry Applied to 

the Development of Biosensors in the Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, Porto University of 

Porto, Porto, Portugal. This work was supervised by Professor Carlos Pereira and as a consequence, 

his first paper was published in the Journal of Analytical Chemistry. 

In 2002, he was enrolled in a Doctoral Program in Biomedical Engineering (2002/2003) at Faculty of 

Engineering, Porto University, Porto, Portugal. During this period he developed research on the 

development of hybrid materials for biomedical applications, at the Institute of Biomedical Engineering 

(INEB), Lab. of Biomaterials, Porto University, Porto, Portugal under the supervision of Professor José 

D. Santos. He also carried out research (research fellow) at Nara Institute of Science and Technology 

(NAIST), Nara, Japan for a short period of time. This work was performed under the supervision 

Professor Chikara Ohtsuki. 

In 2004, he was invited to move the 3B’s Research Group as researcher under the scope of the 

Hippocrates project. He formally started his PhD at the 3B’s Research Group, in 2005, after being 

awarded with a grant from the FCT under the supervision of Professor Rui L. Reis, in collaboration with 

the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST); Tissue Engineering 

Research Group, Research Institute of Cell Engineering (RICE), Osaka, Japan under the local 

supervision of Doctor Hajime Ohgushi. During the year of 2005, his work was distinguished with the 

Best Student Award (Oral Presentation), for the paper entitled “Innovative Technique for the Preparation 

of Porous Bilayer Hydroxyapatite/Chitosan Scaffolds for Osteochondral Applications”, as part of the 18th 

International Symposium on Ceramics in Medicine - Bioceramics 18, held in Kyoto, Japan. In 2008, he

was distinguished with the Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine International Society - EU 

Chapter (TERMIS-EU) ‘50 Best Ranked Abstract’ AWARD, Porto Meeting, Portugal. 

As a researcher in the 3B’s, he was enrolled in the elaboration of several approved projects (National 

and European), as part of the organization of several scientific meetings (e.g. InVents-Series of events 

and the 2008 Annual Meeting of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine-European Chapter), 

and in the development of the business plan of STEMMATTERS, which is the biotechnological spin-off 

of the 3B’s Research Group. He has been also involved in the supervision of several under-graduated 

students (e.g. Seminars of Mechanics: 3rd year Biomedical Engineering and final year of Polymer 

Chemistry both at University of Minho). He was one of the mentors of the new facilities of the 3B’s 

Research Group and the Headquarters of the European Institute of Excellence on Tissue Engineering 

and Regenerative Medicine at Avepark, Caldas das Taipas-Guimarães, Portugal. In addition, he is 

referee in several scientific and international journals, such as the Journal of Cellular and Molecular 

Medicine: Reviewer Invitation, Tissue Engineering, Marine Biology and Journal of Tissue Engineering 

and Regenerative Medicine. Moreover, he is currently the elected treasurer of Tissue Engineering and 

Regenerative Medicine International Society-Student and Young Investigator Section in Europe. 

As a result of his research efforts within the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, 

presently he is author or co-author of more than 16 publications in international journals, 10 proceedings 

in international meetings and participated as oral presenter/poster presenter in approximately 40 

international meetings.

INTRODUCTION TO THE THESIS FORMAT. 

 

This thesis contains two main parts namely, the preliminary part which is related with authorship and 

thesis information, and body of the thesis. The late is organized in four sections that include a total of 

eleven chapters. The body of thesis chapters is based on the series of related papers published in 

international journals or submitted for publication, which are specified with each chapter. Thus, each 

thesis chapter is presented in manuscript form in a style consistent with the papers, i.e. an abstract, 

introduction, materials and methods, results, discussion and conclusions sections. A list of references is 

also provided as a subsection within each chapter. The order of thesis chapters is as given below. 

 

SECTION 1:  

The first chapter is this thesis introduction and is concerned on reviewing the exploratory research 

merging nanotechnology and regenerative medicine. It also summarizes the fundamentals on the 

synthesis and macromolecular structure, ability to design and improve the biological performance of 

dendrimers and its derivatives. Special focus is devoted on the novel applications and recent work 

involving dendrimers in the fields of tissue engineering and central nervous system, but extends into 

gene delivery and theranostics, which are succinctly reviewed. Some remarks on the need to conduct 

comprehensive research in vivo are provided, and new research directions are also proposed. 

 

SECTION 2:  

Chapter II fully describes the experimental work and protocols related to the obtained results. Along with 

Chapter I, it provides a guideline of the rationale for the research, namely on the aspects related with 

the selection of the materials, on the developed processing routes, and characterization strategies and 

protocols used. 

 

SECTION 3:  

The thesis chapters included within this section are based on the series of related papers that resulted 

from research work already published or submitted for publication. 

Chapter III describes a novel “autocatalytic” electroless deposition route for production of composite 

scaffolds composed of hydroxylapatite (HAp) and carboxymethylchitosan (CMCht) for bone tissue

engineering scaffolding applications. The physicochemical characterization in terms of architecture, 

degradability and bioactivity is presented herein. 

Chapter IV reports a new methodology for developing HAp scaffolds by using an organic sacrifice 

template, and its potential to find applications in bone tissue engineering scaffolding investigated. The 

novelty of this work consists on the possibility of obtaining porous and highly interconnected scaffolds 

mimicking the sacrificial component. It were evaluated the physicochemical properties of the HAp 

scaffolds. Cytotoxicity of the HAp scaffolds was investigated by both carrying direct observation of 

mouse fibroblasts cells (L929 cell-line) death and performing a luminescent cell viability assay rat bone 

marrow stromal cells (RBMSCs).  

Chapter V describes the development of novel hydroxylapatite/chitosan (HAp/CHT) bilayered scaffold 

by combining a freeze-drying technique for the cartilage region and a layer for bone regeneration based 

on the HAp supports developed in the previous chapter. The developed HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds 

are aimed at find applications in osteochondral TE strategies, and were characterized herein by different 

techniques. The intrinsic cytotoxicity of the HAp scaffolds and HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds extract 

fluids was investigated by carrying out a cellular viability assay (MTS test) using mouse fibroblastic-like 

cells. Moreover, in vitro cell culture studies were carried out to evaluate the capacity of HAp and CHT 

layers to separately, support the growth and differentiation of goat bone marrow stromal cells 

(GBMSCs) into osteoblasts and chondrocytes, respectively.  

Chapter VI describes the synthesis of surface engineered carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) 

dendrimer (CMCht/PAMAM) nanoparticles for applications as a intracellular nanocarrier. Such 

structures are proposed to be used as carriers to deliver bioactive molecules aimed at controlling the 

behaviour of stem cells, namely their proliferation and differentiation. Cytotoxicity and internalization 

efficiency was investigated using both human osteoblast-like cells and RBMSCs, under fluorescence-

activated cell sorting and fluorescence microscopy analyses. As a model drug, dexamethasone (Dex) 

was incorporated into CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and release rates were determined by 

high performance liquid chromatography. Moreover, the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles osteogenic potential was also investigated using RBMSCs and compared to that of typical 

osteogenic media, in vitro.  

Chapter VII preliminary evaluates the possible applicability of the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles in central nervous system (CNS). Internalization rate, cell viability and metabolic activity 

studies were performed using post-natal hippocampal neurons and cortical glial cells.  



- li - 
 

Chapter VIII was designed to investigate the effect of combining novel Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles and, both HAp (developed in Chapter IV) and SPCL scaffolds (3-D system) on 

the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of RBMSCs, in vitro. A detailed biological characterization 

is presented. 

Chapter IX is the first of two in vivo studies and exploits the potential of the combinatorial strategy in 

tissue engineering principles employing CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles towards the 

intracellular release and regimented supply of Dex aimed at control stem cells osteogenic differentiation 

in the absence of typical osteogenic inducers, in vivo. The effect of initial cell number seeded in the HAp 

scaffolds on the bone forming ability of the constructs was also investigated. Qualitative and quantitative 

new bone formation was evaluated using the non-destructive micro-computed tomography analysis of 

the explants, and Haematoxylin &amp;amp; Eosin staining of the explant sections, followed by 

histomorphometrical analysis.  

Chapter X reports deeper studies on the chemistry of the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles namely the data on proton nuclear magnetic resonance, dynamic light scattering and zeta 

potential analyses. Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles internalization efficiency, 

osteogenic potential and bone forming ability were also evaluated, in vitro and in vivo. For this study, 

SPCL scaffolds were used as the 3-D matrix, as these scaffolds exhibit lower attenuation coefficient 

than bone, thus we can envision investigate qualitatively and quantitatively the calcified tissue within the 

explants using a non-destructive and time-saving technique such as micro-computed tomography.  

 

SECTION 4:  

This thesis ends with Chapter XI, which is the summary and conclusions of the research work under the 

scope of this thesis.

Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a 

review 

Abstract 

Since the pioneering work dealing with the synthesis and physicochemical aspects of dendrimers, a 

predictable and tunable set of compositions for therapeutic, scaffolding and imaging systems has been 

reported. Although many of the work involving dendrimer synthesis and traditional applications has been 

well documented many hot issues should be examined and thus need to be reviewed, namely those 

related with most recent and notable advances of dendritic polymers that show promise in the field of 

regenerative medicine.  Herein, a review is given on dendritic nanopolymers, especially on dendrimer 

and dendrons technology and their surface engineering to deliver and target drugs or bring imaging 

agents to the targets where they are required. This review begins with a brief overview on the 

exploratory research merging nanotechnology and regenerative medicine. Fundamentals on the 

synthesis and macromolecular structure of dendritic polymers are provided. The unique advantages of 

dendrimers comparing to traditional macromolecular architectures (e.g. linear, cross-linked, branched) 

are a consequence of their inherent properties, i.e. large surface area, shape, functionalization, and 

high efficiency for the cellular uptake which possibly dendrimers fulfill the requirements as carriers for 

gene, nucleic acids, bioactive molecules and peptide/protein delivery. The huge portfolio of degradable 

and non-degradable controlled-release vehicles are being investigated for their processing into 

nanocarriers, several new emerging nanomaterials are being studied for their biodegradability, 

controlled-release and stimuli-responsive properties. Therefore, the release of different or multiple 

bioactive agents, each with its own kinetic profile, which can be released under the action of specific 

stimuli, is becoming possible. However, to make use of this potential, toxicological, drug loading 

capacity and host-guest chemistries in dendrimers must be addressed. These issues are included within 

the scope of this review. Moreover, we will discuss possible strategies that can be taken to overcome 

some of the dendrimers limitations. Further attention is given on the progress in the targeting strategies 

and it is discussed its importance in the therapeutic efficiency and in avoiding the undesired secondary 

effects of several drugs. Therefore, their ability to target delivery to specific sites in the human body 

possibly the improvement of the bioavailability of therapeutic molecules, decrease the dosage and 

frequent re-dosage needs. In addition, integration of the nanocontrolled-release systems with other

desirable functions to create new and cross-discipline applications can also be realized by means of 

using dendrimer technology. In the following sections of this review, special focus is provided on the 

novel applications and recent work involving dendrimers in both fields of tissue engineering and central 

nervous system. In regenerative medicine field, dendrimer-based polymers have been attracting great 

attention as drug delivery system (DDS) to deliver bioactive molecules aimed at modulate the behavior 

of stem cells, i.e. their proliferation and differentiation, in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, due to their 

innovative character other applications beyond DDS became possible, namely as scaffolding and 

chemoattractants for tissue regeneration, and implantable biodegradable nanomaterial-based medical 

devices integrated with drug delivery functions (theranostics). Finally, within the scope of this review we 

highlight promising areas for further research and succinctly comment on how and why dendrimers and 

dendrons technology should be viewed as the next generation of biomaterials for the 21st century.

1. INTRODUCTION 

During the 20th century, we have assisted to great innovations on polymer synthesis and advances in 

the design of biodegradable chemistries. These achievements allowed obtaining macromolecules of 

multiple compositions and novel architectures possessing unique physicochemical and biological 

properties. Synthetic polymers can be divided into four key architectural classes: linear, cross-linked, 

branched, and dendritic structures. The first three types have been studied extensively in the past. The 

fourth comprises the nature-inspired dendrimers and its derivatives and are reviewed herein. These are 

highly branched and nanospherical macromolecules, and are the most prominent example of nano-

polymer revolution. The first report is attributed to Tomalia et al. [1] and dates to the early 1980s.  These 

novel structures differ from typical linear polymers, since their architecture is extremely precise and 

controlled conferring them with tunable and predictable molecular weights, biodegradability and 

biocompatibility. This chemistry revolution igniting many possibilities and it is not surprisingly that we 

now assist to their burst exploitation in a variety of medical applications.  

In this review, we report on the noteworthy scientific advances and most recent literature, dealing with 

the dendritic polymers nanotechnology and brief discuss on the convergence of nanotechnology and 

regenerative medicine. Fundamentals on dendrimers will be succinctly provided. Numerous synthetic 

strategies have been reported for the preparation of dendrimer-based materials. The present review will 

also focus on the most recent advances in the dendrimers surface engineering, which allowed obtaining 

novel and promising complexities (architectures and chemical functionalities) such as the dendronized 

polymers. Interesting features reported for dendronized polymers are also discussed, as well as some 

suggestions for potential applications such as tissue engineering (TE), central nervous system (CNS), 

gene delivery and theranostics will be also highlighted wherein.  

1.1. CONVERGENCE OF NANOTECHNOLOGY AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE 

In 1959, Richard Feynman [2] coined nanotechnology as a futuristic approach to the development of 

materials atom by atom. The ultimate goal of nanotechnology can be described as the ability to apply 

the nanoscale principles and work at the atomic, molecular and supramolecular levels (on the range of 

1-100 nm) to understand, and create material systems by assembling molecules into objects or vice-

versa. Nanotechnology provides solutions for the transformation of biosystems and provides a broad 

collection of technologies, techniques and processes for real life purposes. Current and potential 

applications of nanotechnology in medicine range from research involving diagnostic devices, drug

delivery vehicles, nanoscale surgery, biosensors and body part repair/regeneration and cancer therapy. 

By its turn, regenerative medicine uncovers fundamental biological processes, self-repairing, self-

replicating, and tissue regeneration mechanisms and offers inspiration models to nanotechnology [3-5]. 

Several examples of applications of nanotechnology in regenerative medicine will be provided further, 

but the currently undergoing explosive developments are summarized in Table 1.

Exploratory research in nanotechnology is considered to be emerging, disruptive and multidisciplinary 

[77]. Since it offers ever more exciting promises of new diagnoses and cures, it can greatly impact every 

aspect of society. Consequently, there have been tremendous investments in this area [5]. 

2. DENDRITIC POLYMERS-DENDRIMERS AND DENDRONS: FUNDAMENTALS AND 

BIOTECHNOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS 

Dendrimers are a unique class of synthetic polymers which play an important role in emerging 

nanotechnology [78,79]. The term ‘‘dendrimer’’ (from greek: dendra, tree and meros, part of) describes the 

architecture of this emerging class of polymeric macromolecules which possess 3-D features that 

resemble a tree (Figure 1). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 1. The typical dendron structure resembles the architecture of a tree (Photo obtained from Casa 

Milà also known as La Pedrera-Barcelona, and makes figurative meaning to Tomalia inspiration from 

nature and a poetic analogy of the dendrimers to nature’s architecture and geometric forms). 

Presently, the dendritic architectural class can be divided into four subclasses: random hyperbranched 

polymers, dendrigraft polymers, dendrons, and dendrimers [79].  More than 100 different dendrimers and 

1,000 surface chemistries are currently known.  

In this section we will deal with the dendrimers fundamental aspects. A typical dendrimer structure 

consists of three basic components (Figure 2): multifunctional central core (?) where other molecules 

can be trapped [80], branched units (Y) that emanates from the central core and external capping-groups 

(E). The highly regular branching units are organized in layers called ‘‘generations’’, and represent the 

repeating monomer unit of these synthetic macromolecules [79]. Therefore, dendrimers can be 

synthesized from simple branched monomer units, in a precise and controlled fashion from trunk to 

DendronDendron

branch and to leaf ‘‘surface groups’’. Dendrimers can be designed to provide a quite versatile choice of 

external functional groups [73] in order to reduce cytotoxicity, enhance transepithelial transport [80,81], for 

interaction with coupling molecules such as natural-based polymers [82] and fluorescent probes [83]. The 

surface groups may also act as passive or reactive gates controlling entry or departure of molecules 

from the dendrimer interior. Surface properties can also allow control clearance and biodistribution in the 

body.

Figure 2. Schematic representation of the dendrimer typical structure. 

Their size, shape, and topology, as well as flexibility and surface functionality, are controlled at the 

molecular level (all three architectural components), which makes them useful building blocks and 

carrier molecules at the nanometer level, but also possibly to precisely manipulate both molecular 

weight and chemical composition. This new class of synthetic [84-86], highly branched, nanospherical 

macromolecules presents unique features in comparison to the traditional linear, cross-linked and 

branched  polymers [79,87], thus many researchers have explored their potential in many biological 

applications. An advantage is related with the fact that the narrow molecular weight distributions (Mw/Mn 

= 1.0000-1.05) can provide reproducible pharmacokinetic behavior [79]. 

There are different types of dendrimers which are classified as: (i) glycodendrimers and (ii) peptide 

dendrimers. Glycodendrimers have been showing a great potential as drug carrier. The term 

‘glycodendrimer’ has been used to describe dendrimers that include carbohydrates into their 

architecture. The vast majority of glycodendrimers have saccharide residues on their outer surface, but 

glycodendrimers containing a sugar unit as the central core from which all branches emanate have also 

been described. Generally, glycodendrimers can be classified as: (i) carbohydrate-centred, (ii) 

carbohydrate-based and (iii) carbohydrate-coated dendrimers. The late will be further exploited in 

section 3, the so-called dendronized polymers.

By its turn, Sadler et al. [88] broadly defined peptide dendrimers  as ‘‘radial or wedge-like branched 

macromolecules consisting of a peptidyl branching core and/or covalently attached surface functional 

units’’. Thus, this definition includes any dendrimer with an amino acid core, branching units, surface 

functional groups or any combination of the three as a peptide dendrimer. In dendrimer synthesis, 

aminoacids are also appealing building blocks because peptide-coupling techniques can be used.  

Despite, most research on dendritic polymers has been conducted with glycodendrimers.  

Both the synthesis and applications of glycodendrimers and peptide dendrimers have been reviewed by 

many [88-91]. Succintly, two different synthetic strategies are currently explored for synthesizing 

structurally well defined dendritic polymers, namely the divergent [87,92] and convergent growth [93-95] 

approaches. Most of the commercially available dendrimers, such as the Tomalia’s dendrimers 

poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers from Dendritech Inc. (Midland, MI, USA) and 

poly(propyleneimine) (PPI) dendrimers from DSM (Geleen, The Netherlands) are produced by divergent 

method. This methodology involves in situ branch-cell construction in stepwise and iterative stages 

around a desired core to produce core-shell structures. In the convergent method (Fréchet approach) 

dendrons are synthesized according to the divergent approach and then are anchored to a 

multifunctional core. Both strategies possess advantages and disadvantages and the appropriate route 

depends mainly on the type of monomer used and the desired structure. Although there are different 

routes to synthesise dendrimers, their maximum size is typically in the order of ~10-20 nm [96,78]. 

Recently, a novel synthetic route has been proposed for new low-cost Priostar dendrimers [97,98]. 

Unlike traditional polymers, the unique characteristics of dendritic polymers make possible their use in a 

wide range of applications. Among the myriad of possibilities, dendritic polymers can find applications as 

a delivery carrier of drugs [80,99,100], and on the development of synthetic vaccines [101] and antitumour 

systems [102,103] and immunology [104,105]. Other applications in the bioscience field includes blood 

anticoagulant [106] and microbicidal [107-109] activities. For example, Jiang [110] reported on a poly-(L-lysine) 

(PLL) dendrimer with a polyanionic outer surface consisting of 32 naphthalene disulfonate units, also 

know as Vivagel (Starpharma Ltd., Melbourne, Australia) to be used as topical vaginal microbicide for 

HIV prevention. These were found to be safe and prevent HIV-1 infection by binding to receptors on the 

viral coat. The promising results potentate VivaGel entering phase II clinical trials in humans [111]. Other 

dendrimer-based DDS have also proved to effectively enhance anti-viral activity by reducing the viral 

load, in vitro [112,113]. Dendrimers have also been useful in prion research [114-116] since cationic 

dendrimers are shown to perturb peptide fibrillation in a process dependent on the nature of the charged 

groups on the dendrimer surface.

Regarding the antitumour systems, dendrimers mimicking the surface structure of proteins involved in 

angiogenesis inhibition have been developed [117,118]. Angiogenesis is an important process for tumour 

growth and is initiated by angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and 

basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF). These growth factors bind to their receptors on endothelial cells 

with the dependence of heparin or heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) in extracellular matrix (ECM). 

The participation of binding to heparin or HSPG leads to potential targets for antiangiogenic activity. 

Endostatin, a weel-known endogenous angiogenic protein binds to heparin or HSPG and inhibits some 

functions of endothelial cells, resulting in potent suppression of angiogenesis. To find a new potent 

angiogenic inhibitors, Shimamura and coworkers [118] have focused their attention on characteristic 

positive-charge-rich surface of endostatin and the interaction between its arginine residues and either 

heparin or HSPG. This group design novel arginine-rich dendrimers, TX-1943 (8 Arg residues) and TX-

1944 (16 Arg residues), which mimic the surface structure of endostatin and evaluated their 

antiangiogenic ability, in vitro and in vivo. In vitro studies demonstrated that both dendrimers bound to 

heparin [118]. During this study, it was also observed that angiogenesis inhibition of b-FGF stimulated 

proliferation and tube formation of endothelial cells, in vitro; however TX-1944 antiangiogenic activity 

was stronger than that of TX-1943. Moroever, both type of dendrimers exhibited potent antiangiogenic 

activity in the chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane assay, in vivo. These data suggest that 

arginine dendrimer can be used in prevention of the growth and metastasis of solid tumours. 

The innovative synthetic procedures increased the accessibility to the functionalization of dendrimers 

with transition metals in the core, finding interesting applications in catalysis [119-122]. Actually, 

dendrimers can combine the advantages of homogenous and heterogeneous catalysts. Homogenous 

catalysts are known for having a good accessibility of active sites. Despite, one of the disadvantages lie 

on the fact that it is difficult to separate from the reaction stream. On the contrary, heterogeneous 

catalysts are easy to separate from the reaction mixture but the disadvantage is that kinetics of the 

reaction is limited by mass transport. Dendrimers have a multifunctional surface and all catalytic sites 

are always exposed towards the reaction mixture. Metallodendrimer research has been steadily gaining 

ground during the last few years. Several authors have been proposing the use of dendrimers to 

develop complexes with metals such as Pt [123], Ag [124,125], Fe [126], Cu and Ni [127].   

Benito et al. [128,129] demonstrated the synthesis of carbosilane dendrimers with N,N?-pyridylimine 

molybdenum and platinum at their periphery. In addition, similar complexes have also been described 

by Al-Hamra [130]. This work reports on the synthesis of second and third generation dendrimers based 

on PLL with a pentaamine cobalt (III) metal complex at the core, following a divergent synthetic

- 13 - 

 

approach. The use of the cobalt complex served as the C-terminal protecting group, which facilitate 

purification and enhanced the dendrimers’ solubility in aqueous and organic solvents.  Similarly, Bellis 

[131] synthesised a series of surface-functionalized proline-modified PPI dendrimers as metal-free 

catalysts for asymmetric aldol reactions which showed improved solubility in organic solvents. Another 

group [132] reported on the synthesis of lipophilic dendrimers, containing crown ether moieties with 

different sizes as the core, surrounded by poly(aromatic ether) wedges of different generations. The 

synthesis route consisted on the use of bis(bromomethyl)-substituted crown ethers and Fréchet-type 

poly(benzyl ether) dendrons as building blocks.  

Most metallodendrimers are built from organic skeletons, in particular from dendrimers of types PAMAM 

or PPI. However, a lot of examples are also known for fluorinated [133] and phosphorus-containing 

dendrimers [134,135]. 

It has been demonstrated that dendrimers containing phenylene ethylene units exhibit a correlation 

between the molecular geometry and the electronic properties [136]. In addition, it was also shown that 

the light-gathering properties increase with the generation although the excitation transfer efficiency to 

the core decreases for generations higher than the sixth [136,137]. Dendrimers are mainly attracting the 

interest of many scientists because of their unique physicochemical characteristics and geometry [138]. 

Light harvesting dendrimers own their efficiency to a highly directed process that delivers captured light 

energy to the core [139]. For example, Akai et al. [140,141] have studied the energy transfer and shielding 

effect in different types of dendrimers. The most recent work, reports on the wire-type dendrimers 

possessing a poly-(p-phenylenevinylene) backbone and having oligophenylene light-harvesting (LH) 

antenna. This study has demonstrated the ability of wire-type dendrimer with a LH-antenna as highly 

efficient light-emitting material. Andrews et al. [142], reported a new approach for modeling the multi-step 

flow and that possibly to reveal the character and patterns of internal energy flow in dendrimeric 

materials. Similar applications have been proposed for fullerodendrimers, i.e. the fullerene-based 

PAMAM-type dendrons. Thus, dendrimers have been useful for encapsulation of core moieties. 

Although the conformation that a dendrimer assumes around a core moiety cannot be directly 

determined, the effect of increasing dendrimer size on the photophysical and electrochemical properties 

of the core has been exploited. Araki et al. [143] have been developing fullerodendrimers for application 

as artificial photosynthesis systems. Their work has shown that the rate constants and quantum yields 

of photo-induced electron transfer with the added aromatic amine donors in benzonitrile tend to 

decrease with the dendron generation. These data thus indicated that the bulky dendron groups acted 

as barriers for the donor molecules to approach the C60 moiety in the core of the dendrimers. Other 



CHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review 
 

 
 
- 14 - 
 

works [144,145] have shown much promise of iridium-based phosphorescent and phenylazomethine 

dendrimer complexes as light emitting materials for efficient organic light emitting diodes.  

As proposed by Ceroni [146], metal-containing dendrimers can be classified from structural viewpoint as: 

(i) dendrimers built around a metal complex as a core; (ii) dendrimers containing metal complexes as 

branching centers; (iii) dendrimers containing metal complexes as peripheral units; (iv) dendrimers that 

can coordinate metal ions by ligand units that are present in the branches; and (v) dendrimers with a 

core which is able to coordinate a metal ion. 

It is likely that improving design of dendrimers will lead to coordination compounds capable of 

performing even more sophisticated functions, such as energy up-conversion and 

electrochemiluminescence. 

Applications of dendrimers in more traditional technologies such as coatings and inks have also been 

exploited, as their spherical shape shows unique rheological characteristics [147]. Dendrimers versatility 

further explains their importance in optic, electronics and magnetic applications [148-150]. Interestingly, a 

recent work [151] propose the use PAMAM dendrimers adsorved onto native oxide surfaces of silicon 

wafers as a strategy to direct the integration of metal electrodeposition with silicon microfabrication 

processes and selective deposition by dendrimer patterning. 

Alonso et al. [152] have describe the development of an amperometric enzyme electrode for glucose 

monitoring. This high sensitive electrode consisted on the electrostatic immobilization of the enzyme 

glucose oxidase onto C and Pt electrodes modified with mixed ferrocene-cobaltocenium dendrimers. 

This work showed that higher generation dendrimers to be more efficient electron transfer mediators, 

and can find applications as sensors. In another study [153], PPI dendrimer cores functionalised with 

octamethylferrocenyl units were deposited onto a Pt electrode. Amperometric biosensors for glucose 

were prepared by immobilization of glucose oxidase (GOX) onto the electrodes and their applications as 

hydrogen peroxide and glucose sensor was investigated. It was also shown that electrodes modified 

with polymethylferrocenyl dendrimer promote the redox reactions of hydrogen peroxide and its efficiency 

was affected by structural characteristics of the dendrimers when low working potentials are used. 

Despite, the biosensors developed possess a good linear response region, and superior sensitivity and 

reproducibility as compared with other ferrocene-mediated glucose sensors. 

Yao et al. [154] have reported on enzyme field effect transistor (ENFET) for determining glucose. This 

biosensor was produced with dendrimer encapsulated Pt nanoparticles and GOX via a layer-by-layer 

self-assembly method. This work demonstrated that the developed biosensor possess good stability, 

enhanced sensitivity and extended lifetime as compared to conventional ones. By its turn Buschbeck

[155] has been proposing the surface modification of low generation dendrimers with triethylene glycol 

methyl ether units to develop ionophores for chemical sensors. 

Another work [156] using erythrocyte ghosts demonstrated that the addition of fourth generation PAMAM 

dendrimer and PAMAM-OH has a dual effect on the activity of human erythrocyte membrane 

acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Low dendrimer (25 ?M) concentrations caused a statistically significant 

increase of the enzyme activity. For dendrimer concentrations higher than 100 ?M, it was observed an 

inhibition of AChE. The efficiency of the inhibition was similar for both amine- and hydroxyl-terminated 

PAMAM dendrimers; however, the maximum of activation occurred at a different range of dendrimer 

concentration; 25 ?M for PAMAM-OH (G4) and 100 ?M for PAMAM (G4). The advanced explanation for 

the changes of AChE activity upon addition of dendrimers was related with the alteration in protein 

structure, but may be associated with the structural changes in the whole membrane.  A study reported 

by Shcharbin [157] aimed at clarify whether AChE inhibition was a result of direct action of dendrimers on 

the enzyme or a result of indirect changes in lipid bilayer of membrane. By performing fluorescence 

analysis it was demonstrated that anionic and cationic dendrimers changed AChE conformation and the 

strongest effect was induced by carboxylic-tterminated PAMAM dendrimers (G3.5). It was also 

demonstrated that changing on AChE conformation and catalytic activity depended on type and 

concentration of the dendrimer.  

Another interesting work reported by Kubát et al. [158], investigated the interaction of porphyrins with 

PAMAM dendrimers of different generation and external groups, in aqueous solution. In that work, the 

binding of porphyrins to PAMAM dendrimers is controlled mainly by electrostatic interactions between 

porphyrins and terminal groups of PAMAM dendrimers (amine or carboxylic groups), and depended on 

both porphyrin peripheral functionalization and pH of the solution. Moreover, low and high generation 

dendrimers formed complexes with porphyrins. 

Shcharbin et al. [159,160] have been studying the interaction of serum albumins with cationic dendrimers. 

In their first study [159], they investigated the interaction of a fourth generation PAMAM dendrimer and 

serum albumins from human (HAS) and bovine (BSA) origin. This study demonstrated that serum 

albumins and PAMAM G4 dendrimer form complexes with stoichiometry of 4-6:1 for PAMAM:HSA and 

4-5:1 for PAMAM:BSA molar ratio. Results obtained from circular dichroism, fluorescence polarization 

and zeta-potential experiments have shown that dendrimers did not significantly change the secondary 

structure of proteins, and interactions between protein and dendrimer were weak. Based on the 3-D 

crystal structures of HSA and BSA, they identified five non-specific anionic regions for binding of 

cationic dendrimers. Another study [160] investigated the effect of the generation of PAMAM dendrimers 



CHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review

(G2 and G6) on the binding to bovine serum albumin (fatty acids free and loaded with different fatty 

acids). This comprehensive work has shown that although proteins loaded with fatty acids have more 

stable structures and were less sensitive to the action of dendrimers, BSA-fatty acid complexes bound 

to PAMAM dendrimers. Results suggested that the efficiency of the interaction depended on the fatty 

acids loaded on the protein, i.e. PAMAM dendrimers were able to compete with BSA for fatty acids if 

two or three fatty acids were loaded per protein.  

An important characteristic of dendritic molecules is their improved solubility in a large number of 

organic solvents [161,162]. An understanding of the interfacial interactions is important to the biomedical 

applications of these polymers. In this respect, it has been shown that dendrimers are able to change 

their conformation on the different alkanethiol surfaces due to their flexibility. Abdelhady et al. [163] have 

conducted an atomic force microscopy (AFM) study to understand the factors affecting the interactions 

of fourth generation  PAMAM dendrimers with substrates of defined surface chemistry. Their results also 

suggest that the surface conformation of such dendrimer molecules can depend upon the nature of the 

different functionalized substrates.  

Recently, Allabashi [164] has reported on an easy method for manufacturing composite filters cross-

linked with silylated dendritic polymers and cyclodextrins (CD). Triethoxysilylated derivatives of PPI 

dendrimer, PPI and polyglycerol hyperbranched polymers and ?-cyclodextrin (?-CD) were impregnated 

into Al2O3, SiC and TiO2 membranes and were tested for the removal of a variety of organic pollutants 

from water. The obtained data proved their efficiency on removing up to 99% polycyclic aromatic 

hydrocarbons, 93% of the monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and up to 43% of pesticides, among 

others. 

Cromer and coworkers [165] have proposed the use of functionalized dendrimers as endotoxin sponges. 

Using in vitro and in vivo models of septic shock, they demonstrated that PAMAM dendrimers partially 

modified by hydrophobic groups effectively bind and sequester bacterial lipopolysaccharides. Therefore, 

these systems potentially can be useful for the therapy of Gram-negative sepsis. Interestingly, Labieniec 

et al. [166] studies provide the first evidence of the therapeutic effect of fourth generation PAMAM 

dendrimers. These were found to lower plasma glucose and suppress long-term markers of diabetic 

hyperglycaemia, in vivo.  

Despite the many advantages and superior performance of the dendrimers highlighted herein, few can 

be obtained with high generations, with exception of PAMAM, PPI, polyphosphane, and triallyl phenol. 

Synthesis of high generation dendrimers, useful for exploring the nature of the dendritic architecture, 

depends critically on the nature of the constituent monomers, their reactivities, and the method of their

preparation. Krishna et al. [167] have previously shown that poly(propyl ether imine) (PETIM) dendrimers 

(G3) possessing alcohol, amine, nitrile, ester or carboxylic acid groups at the peripheries can be 

obtained. Moreover, during their studies it was demonstrated that PETIM dendrimers with carboxylic 

acid groups were non-toxic over two different cell lines: human breast cancer T47D and African green 

monkey kidney (CV-1) cells. Jayamurugan et al. [168] have also reported on the synthesis of high 

generation PETIM dendrimers. This group obtained PETIM dendrimers up to G6 by carrying out simple 

iterative steps consisting of two alternate Michael additions and two reduction reactions. The 

disadvantage is that the procedure is long, but the overall yields are quite good for lower generations. 

They have shown to be possible tailoring the peripheries of these dendrimers by introducing different 

groups such as alcohols, amines, carboxylic acids, esters, or nitriles, and up to 128 external groups, 

thereby opening up new properties and possibilities for several applications.  

The well-defined hyperbranched structure of dendrimers has motivated chemists to explore the 

possibility for mimicking protein functions with dendritic macromolecules [169], such as O2-carrying 

hemoproteins [170] and Coenzyme B12 [171]. In the next section, this issue will be explored further. 

3. DENDRITIC POLYMERS IN REGENERATIVE MEDICINE 

3.1. DRUG DELIVERY APPLICATIONS OF DENDRIMERS AND DENDRONIZED POLYMERS 

The development of nanotechnology-based efficient drug delivery systems for small molecules, proteins 

and DNA has been attracting great deal of attention over the last few years. Unlike traditional polymers, 

dendrimers can be obtained in precise molecular weights even at high generations, which as previously 

highlighted can provide a reproducible pharmacokinetic behaviour. This feature makes them ideal 

candidates for drug delivery applications. Despite, a efficient drug delivery systems should meet other 

criteria, such as: (i) structural control over size and shape of drug or imaging-agent cargo-space; (ii) 

biocompatibility, non-toxic polymer/pendant functionality; (iii) precise, nanoscale-container and/or 

scaffolding properties with high drug loading capacity; (iv) well-defined scaffolding and/or surface 

modifiable functionality for cell-specific targeting moieties; (v) lack of immunogenicity; (vi) appropriate 

cellular adhesion and internalization, (vii) adequate bio-elimination or biodegradation; (viii) controlled or 

stimuli-responsive drug release features; (ix) molecular level isolation and protection of the drug against 

inactivation during transit to target cells; (x) minimal non-specific cellular and blood-protein binding 

properties; (xi) ease of consistent, reproducible, clinical grade synthesis.

In regenerative medicine, the control of cells behavior at the nanoscale is addressed via cell-adhesion 

receptors. The surface of eukaryotic cells is covered with an array of glycoconjugates, (e.g. 

glycoproteins and glycolipids). Extracellularly, carbohydrates in some of the glycoconjugates play a key 

role in the process of cell-cell and cell-pathogen adhesion. Furthermore, they also participate in such 

fundamental processes as glycan cross-linking in the ECM. Intracellularly, carbohydrate receptors are 

involved in such key biological processes as protein folding and sorting of proteins (e.g. the degradative 

lysosomal enzymes). It is the weak binding of most carbohydrate ligands for their protein receptors, that 

requires these carbohydrates to be clustered in order to attain biologically meaningful affinities toward 

their receptors (e.g. lectin type) [172]. In order to refine the biological activities and drug delivery by 

dendritic polymers, efficient carbohydrate ligands of the glycodendrimer-type are emerging as potent 

ligands for carbohydrate-binding proteins. Such type of molecules can be obtained through surface 

engineering using a carbohydrate coating on the dendrimeric system, the so-called dendronized 

polymers (Figure 3).  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 3. Comparison of the structure of (A) PAMAM dendrimer (G2), (B) PAMAM dendrimer bearing 

carbohydrate end groups (dendronized polymer). 

Dendrimers modified with the terminal carbohydrate polymers constitute a new class of biopolymers 

with many interesting applications. Dendronized polymers can be conveniently synthesized with a good 

yield using both divergent and convergent approaches or using as well chemoenzymatic approaches 

[173]. Another advantage of these systems is related with the chemical nature of the synthetic linker and 

the possibility of tailoring the type of glycosidic linkages in these compounds, which gives us additional 

flexibility to meet demands from the point of view of hydrophobicity, and biodegradability [172]. Moreover,

these compounds can grow to considerable size by successive cycles of branching, which give them a 

unique possibility to vary the degree of carbohydrate clustering required by the carbohydrate receptors. 

Potentially, such type of molecules can be used for treatment and control of metabolic disorders 

involving carbohydrates, and protection against certain types of infections.  

Dendronized polymers with a variety of shapes, core molecules, carbohydrate residues and valences 

are made available for the biological evaluation. This new class of materials is expected to exhibit 

entirely new properties since the structures might have sizes larger than 10 nm and different surface 

properties [85]. In fact, the linking of terminal sugar residues such as heparin on dendrimers can create a 

multivalent display that mimic cell-surface glycans [174]. This strategy showed that heparin dendrimers 

promote FGF-2-mediated mitogen-activated kinase activation in L6 myoblasts. Thus, these 

glycodendrimers can modulate heparin-protein interactions.  

It has been found [175] that high generation dendrimers (G7) with amine capping-groups causes 

haemolysis and changes the morphology of red cells, since they bind to membranes of cells (negatively 

charged) in a non-specific manner and can cause toxicity in vitro and in vivo. Similar findings were 

reported by Domanski et al. [176] that investigated the effect of PAMAM dendrimers concentration and 

generation (G2, G3 and G4) on human red blood cells. This paper demonstrated that erythrocyte shape 

changed and was accompanied by dendrimer-induced haemolysis when these cells were exposed to 

nanoparticules concentrations ranging between 1 nM and 1 ?M. Moreover, it was conclusive that when 

higher dendrimer generation was used, a lower concentration of PAMAM dendrimer was needed to 

cause haemolysis. These observations were supported by the work of Jevprasesphant et al. [177]. The 

cytotoxicity of unmodified PAMAM dendrimers towards Caco-2 cells was appreciably higher for cationic 

(whole generation) compared with anionic (half generation) dendrimers and for both types increased 

with increasing size (generation) and concentration. King Heiden et al. [178] have also demonstrated that 

PAMAM dendrimers amine-terminated (G4) are toxic and attenuated growth and development of 

zebrafish embryos at sublethal concentrations.  However, PAMAM dendrimers carboxylic terminated 

(G3.5) were not toxic to zebrafish embryos. Dutta et al. [179] study corroborated previous findings that 

demonstrated the cytotoxic behaviour of PPI dendrimer amine-terminated (G5), in vitro. Recently, 

Libieniec et al. [166] have also shown the cytotoxic effects of PAMAM dendrimers (G4), in vivo.  It was 

found that PAMAM dendrimers increased mortality of streptozotocin-diabetic rats. In a study reported by 

Neerman [180], melamine dendrimer were developed and their potential as a vehicle for drug delivery 

applications was investigated. The preliminary in vitro study has shown a decrease in Clone 9 cells 

viability at 0.1 mg.mL-1 as compared to that of cells cultured in the presence of dextran. For the in vivo

study, mice were administered with increasing concentrations of dendrimer via i.p. injection. At a higher 

concentration (160 mg.kg-1), 100% mortality was observed and histopathological data revealed 

hepatoxicity. At low concentrations (2.5-40 mg.kg-1) of the dendrimers, no mortality was seen, and no 

hepatic damage was found. These data suggest that the toxicity of the melamine-based dendrimer is 

comparable to the cationic PAMAM dendrimers, and further studies needs to be carried out to evaluate 

their potential as DDS. 

Surface engineered dendrimers with carbohydrates should make it also possible to avoid the cytotoxic 

effects of cationic and high generation dendrimers and reduce the haemolytic toxicity by 

reduction/shielding of the positive charge on the dendrimer surface, while enhancing the peripheral 

congestion to improve container properties. The development of strategies for the synthesis of 

dendrimers based on novel cores and branches continues to be one of the important aspects of 

dendrimer chemistry due to the need for tailoring rigidity and density to refine drug release kinetics. 

Sashiwa and coworkers [82,181-183] have established the synthesis of a variety of chitosan-dendrimer 

dendronized polymers mainly by two procedures: i) dendrimers bearing aldehyde and a spacer are 

synthesized, and then these are reacted with chitosan by reductive N-alkylation, and ii) linking of 

chitosan to the dendrimer surface. The first approach has the advantage of no crosslinking during the 

reaction.  The second allows use of commercially available amino-dendrimers such as PAMAM and 

poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) dendrimers. At least two binding points are available; however, this can be a 

drawback as it can cause an undesired crosslinking. Following these studies, Oliveira and coworkers 

[184] have proposed surface engineer PAMAM dendrimers with the water-soluble carboxymethylchitosan 

(CMCht) to develop novel sphere-like nanoparticles aimed at find application as carriers to deliver 

intracellularly bioactive molecules. These are aimed at control from inside the behavior of stem cells, 

namely their proliferation and differentiation. Dubber et al. [185] previously reported on the synthesis of a 

carbohydrate-centered PAMAM dendrimers. First, D-glucose was converted into its per-aminoethyl-

functionalized derivative, which was then submitted to the multi-step reaction for obtaining the PAMAM 

branches. Domanski et al. [186] also shown that thiophosphate dendrimers (G5) were neither haemotoxic 

nor cytotoxic within the concentration range from 100 pM to 10 ?M, thus being good candidates for drug 

delivery. A marked decrease in the cytotoxicity of amine-terminated PAMAM dendrimers was noted 

when the surface was modified with the addition of six lauroyl or four PEG chains [177]. Dutta et al. [179] 

have demonstrated that the surface modification of PPI (G5) dendrimers with mannose and N-tert-

butoxycarbonyl (t-Boc) decrease haemolitic toxicity and cytotoxicity over HepG2 and COS-7 cell lines, in 

vitro. Moreover, an in vivo study [187] using Wistar rats showed that administration of PPI dendrimers

- 21 - 

 

(G5) caused haemolysis and tissue degeneration, after 24 hours. On the contrary, no signs of toxicity 

were observed in animals to which surface-modified PPI dendrimers were administered, suggesting that 

functionalization of dendrimers leads to drastic reduction of toxicity and increases biocompatibility. 

Makimura and coworkers [188] have investigated glycodendrimers with a lysine core and with different 

carbohydrates on the exterior. Compared to the mono-functional structure, L-lysine dendrimers with 8 or 

16 sialic acid residues show enhance binding properties and efficiently suppress the hemagglutination 

of erythrocytes.  

A surface engineering strategy was also on the basis of Jevprasesphant et al. [189] work to improve the 

properties of dendrimers. It was found that conjugation of cationic PAMAM dendrimers with lauroyl 

chloride decreased their cytotoxicity and increased their permeation through Caco-2 cell monolayers. 

Another study [178] has demonstrated that when the tripeptide Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) was conjugated to 

PAMAM dendrimers (G4), these were less potent in causing embryo toxicity as compared to 

nonconjugated dendrimers.  

Dendronized polymers can display a higher loading capacity and allow the bulk incorporation of 

bioactive molecules of higher molecular weights and of different chemistry, while maintaining high 

internalization and transfection efficiency as compared to conventional dendrimer (Figure 4). For 

example, Kono et al. [190] designed PEG-modified dendrimers having a shell of hydrophobic amino acid 

residues in the peripheral moiety of the dendrimer to increase their encapsulation ability. L-

phenylalanine or ?-benzyl-l-glutamate residues were introduced to all chain ends of fourth generation 

PAMAM dendrimers, and then PEG (Mw 2000) chains were attached to the amino acid residues. 

Results have shown that the surface engineering of the PAMAM dendrimers improved the binding of 

Rose Bengal guest molecules than the dendrimer without the external layer. 

Dendritic polymers offer an interesting possibility as complexing agents for enhanced transdermal 

delivery of hydrophobic drugs [100]. Several dendrimers have shown solubility enhancement of drugs 

such as dexamethasone (Dex), nifedipine, camphotecin, quinolones and indomethacin that are 

hydrophobic or not very soluble in water [92,100,191,192].  Other studies [193,194] have also demonstrated the 

ability of PAMAM dendrimers to enhance the solubility of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 

(NSAIDs), such as naproxen, ketoprofen, ibuprofen and diflunisal.

The existence of inner cavities with different architectures in the dendrimers can be used to design 

controlled delivery systems [195], where the drug pharmacokinetics can be modulated as desired [100,196-

198]. The interior of the dendrimers needs to be hydrophobic so that a drug can be loaded. The exterior 

of the dendrimer, however, usually needs to be hydrophilic to improve the bioavailability in the body [198]. 

Factors such as the ionization state of the drug have also been reported to affect the release of drug 

from PAMAM dendrimers [199].  

On the other hand, high drug loading influences the water solubility of the product and the biodistribution 

of the conjugates [200]. Agashe et al. [201] have studied the biodistribution pattern of the PPI dendrimer-

based carbohydrate (mannose and lactose)-coated glycodendrimers (G5) in mice, in order to explore 

the potential of these systems as drug carriers. These complexes were found to be stable both in vitro 

and in vivo. All systems were cleared rapidly from circulation. Moreover, clearance of mannose-coated 

PPI dendrimer and lactose-coated PPI dendrimer was faster than PPI alone. All complexes 

accumulated in liver, but only those with terminal carbohydrate moieties were retained for a longer 

period of time, which was related to lectin-carbohydrate interactions. This information is significant since 

it serve as a useful platform in designing carbohydrate-coated dendrimers for the delivery of bioactive 

agents to liver.  

The attraction of dendronized polymers as DDS arises from the possibility to control and refine drug 

delivery. Actually, they can allow a temporally controlled delivery of single or multiple compounds, since

step-wise degradation can be achieved due to the variety of chemical linkages within their structure 

(Figure 5). 

A B C

 

Figure 5. Photos of dendrons and figurative representation of nature’s architecture and controlled-

release strategy (top). Schematic representation of the step-wise (A?C) degradation of dendronized 

polymers, from periphery to core (bottom). 

Response to certain stimulus is a fundamental process of living systems.  Learning from nature inspired 

scientists to develop materials that  respond  to  external  stimuli  such  as temperature,  pH,  light,  

electric  field,  chemicals and  ionic  strength [202]. Thus, smart or stimuli-responsive polymers respond to 

specific changes in their environment and as a consequence dramatic changes in their physical 

properties occurs (e.g.  shape,  surface  characteristics,  solubility,  formation  of an  intricate molecular 

self-assembly or a sol-to-gel transition). The versatility of smart polymeric materials makes them one of 

the most appealing interfaces of chemistry and biology. Interestingly, it has been reported [203-206] 

dendrimers whose degradation can be initiated by different induced-reactions either at the periphery and 

core, which lead to their complete depolymerization, the so-called self-immolative dendrimers.             

Hiu et al. [207] have reported on dendritic PAMAM core (G3) and poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl 

methacrylate) (PDMA) synthesized via a atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), the so-called    

G3-PAMAM-g-PDMA. Chlorambucil (CLB), an anticancer drug was used as a model drug. The 

controlled drug release from polymers with different average graft length of PDMA was investigated by 

UV spectroscopy. Results have shown that the rate of the drug release could be controlled by pH. 

Actually, release of CLB from the dendrimer derivative was faster at pH 1.4 than at pH 10.0. Moreover, 

the release of CLB from G3-PAMAM-g-PDMA was apparently slower as compared to that from CLB

incorporated into the PAMAM dendrimer. In addition, these studies have also shown that                     

G3-PAMAM-g-PDMA presented a typical thermo-responsive character.  

Pistolis et al. [208] have reported on amine-terminated diaminobutane PPI dendrimers (DAB-32 or      

DAB-64) as pH-sensitive controlled-release systems. As a model system, pyrene was incorporated into 

the PPIs dendrimers. Release studies revealed that pyrene incorporation is favored in basic 

environments and mainly close to the core of PPI dendrimers, while its release is induced in acidic 

media.  

Zheng et al. [209] have synthesized dendrimer-star poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAM) polymers 

with narrow Mw using dithiobenzoate-terminated PPI dendrimer (G2 and G3) via a reversible addition-

fragmentation transfer (RAFT). The aqueous solution of the dendrimer-star PNIPAAM was found to be 

thermo-sensitive with a LCST around 32?C. Thus, the use of methacrylic acid along with NIPAAM, not 

only induce changes in the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) but also allows obtaininge 

materials responsive to both temperature and pH. 

pH and T-activated polymers demonstrated to be successful drug delivery systems. By its turn, 

photochemical-internalization (PCI) allows site-specific delivery, i.e. escape of the macromolecules from 

endocytic vesicles into the cytosol. Lai et al. [210] have conjugated doxorubicin (Dox) to PAMAM 

dendrimers via pH-sensitive and insensitive linkers, acid-labile hydrazone linkages (PAMAM-hyd-Dox) 

and amide (PAMAM-amide-Dox), respectively. In their study they combined doxorubicin-dendrimers 

with different PCI strategies to evaluate the cytotoxic effects. Results showed that both PCI strategies 

promoted the PAMAM-amide-Dox cytosolic distribution, but significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of 

free Dox on human gingival cancer (Ca9-22) cells at higher concentrations. The authors failed to 

develop a multi-modality cancer treatment, but their data provided insights on possible research 

directions, namely the need to exploit other spacers besides amide-linkage, in drug-polymer complexes. 

Papagiannaros et al. [211] have screened the cytotoxic of Dox-PAMAM dendrimer complex attached to 

liposomes using different human cancer cell lines (e.g. lung, colon, breast, central nervous system and 

prostate). In this innovative work Dox was incorporated into PAMAM dendrimers (3:1 molar ratio) (1) 

with an efficiency of 97%, and the anticancer activity investigated. Dox-PAMAM complex was also 

attached to hexadecylphosphocholine:eggphosphatidylcholine:stearylamine 10:10:0.1 (molar ratio) (2) 

and eggphosphatidylcholine:stearylamine 10:0.1 (molar ratio) (3) liposomes and the incorporation 

efficiency was 91 and 95%, respectively. The in vitro cytotoxicity tests revealed that Dox-PAMAM 

dendrimers retained high growth inhibiting activity which was decreased when the complex attached to 

liposome 3. The activity of Dox was enhanced when hexadecylphosphocholine was incorporated to

liposomal formulation (2). Formulation 2 was superior from all the three formulations against all cell lines 

tested. It is of interest that the dendrimeric liposomal formulation enhanced the activity of Dox against 

one type of breast cells. The most sensitive cell lines were those originated from lung cancer, 

suggesting a selective action of Dox as compared to the rest of the cell lines. This was an incouranging 

and promosing data, showing that dendrimeric liposomal formulations may be a valuable strategy for the 

superior performance of DDS aimed at treat several types of cancer. 

Wiwattanapatapee [212] investigated the use of dendrimers for colon-specific drug delivery applications. 

In their studies, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) was bound to the water-soluble dendrimer using different 

spacers containing azo-bond (e.g. p-aminobenzoic acid, PABA and p-aminohippuric acid, PAH). PAH 

provide the polymer conjugates a higher loading capacity (3 times) for 5-ASA as compared to that of 

dendrimer conjugates with PABA as the spacer. In vitro studies with cecal content of rats were carried 

out for investigating drug release from dendrimer conjugates. The release of 5-ASA from both 

conjugates was significantly slower as compared to that of sulfasalazine (SA), a commercial prodrug. 

Moreover, the conjugate with PAH linker showed significant higher amount of initial drug release than 

the conjugate with the PABA linker. As a consequence, the amount of drug released from PAMAM-

PAH-SA was significantly higher than that of PAMAM-PABA-SA conjugate. This study nicely illustrated 

the potential use of PAMAM dendrimer for colon-specific drug delivery, and the important role of the 

spacers for the optimization of drug release. 

Ghorai and coworkers [213] have described the first molecules of anthracene capped chiral dendrimers 

derived from a 1,3,5-trisubstituted aromatic core and carbohydrate units in the interior and periphery. 

These are claimed to be suitable for anchoring other useful functionalities aimed at find applications as 

DDS and light harvesting materials. 

It is known that carbohydrate substructures of cell surface glycoconjugates constitute important binding 

sites for pathogen infection. Dendrimeric systems for use in a lectin-binding assays have been 

developed [214]. Mannose receptors are present in the surface of monocyte/macrophages (Mo/Mac), 

alveolar macrophages, astrocytes in brain, and hepatocytes in liver. For example, targeting of anti 

retroviral drugs to macrophages, which by its turn are the target cells for HIV, could be an attractive 

approach in improving the therapeutic efficacy and reducing the toxicity of antiretroviral drugs. In this 

context, Dutta [113] explored the targeting potential and anti-HIV activity of lamivudine (3TC, antiretroviral 

drug) loaded mannosylated fifth generation poly(propyleneimine) dendrimers (MPPI). The entrapment 

efficiency of 3TC loaded MPPI and PPI dendrimers (G5) were found to be ~43 and ~36%, respectively. 

The in vitro release profile showed that mannose-modified PPI slows down drug release as compared to

- 26 - 
 

that of unmodified PPI dendrimers. The results of in vitro internalization studies showed significant 

increase in lymphoblast human T (MT2) cells uptake of 3TC when MPPI was used as compared to that 

for PPI and free drug. This result evidence that MPPI interacts with the lectin receptors present on the 

surface of MT2 cells leading to its enhanced cellular uptake. Antiretroviral activity was determined using 

MT2 cell lines by estimating p24 antigen by ELISA, which is a widely accepted method of quantifying the 

viral load in HIV infection. 3TC loaded PPI and MPPI formulations were found to possess higher       

anti-HIV activity, mainly due to the enhanced cellular uptake of 3TC. These data suggest that the 

proposed MPPI drug delivery carrier has great potential to increase the efficacy and reduce the toxicity 

of antiretroviral therapy.  

Tuftsin, a natural macrophage activator tetrapeptide constituted of Thr-Lys-Pro-Arg, presents a broad 

spectrum of activities and binds to several cells of immune system. For example, Dutta et al. [112] have 

synthesized a tuftsin conjugated PPI dendrimers (G5) for targeting to circulating Mo/Mac. These 

systems proved to hold potential for the controlled and targeted delivery of antiretroviral drugs. Tuftsin-

conjugated-PPI stimulated the phagocytic activity of the Mo/Mac especially in HIV infected cells, 

contributing to the anti-HIV activity of the drug due to its inherent antiretroviral activity. These materials 

were also found to be non-cytotoxic, in vivo [187]. 

Research on dendrimeric-based artificial virus receptors has been attracting great deal of attention. 

Yamada et al. [215] successfully synthesized a novel class of carbosilane dendrimer periphery-

functionalized lacto-N-neotetraose, which is aimed at mimic dengue virus receptor. In another work [214], 

they synthesized carbosilane dendrimers periphery-functionalized with lactotriaose (GlcNAc?1-3Gal?1-

4Glc) with valencies of three, four, six, and twelve for use in a lectin-binding assay. The hexavalent 

glycodendrimer showed a 2500-fold larger binding effect than that of free lactotriaose, though the 

dodecavalent one exhibited only a 1200-fold larger binding effect. Interestingly, the same group also 

reported [216] on the potential of carbosilane dendrimers periphery-functionalized with galabiose (three, 

four, and six galabiose residues) for use as artificial inhibitors against Shiga toxins. Bhadra et al. [217] 

have synthesized PPI dendrimers-coated with galactose and investigated the efficienct on delivering 

primaquine phosphate (PP, a liver schizonticide) directly to liver cells. Results showed that the coating 

of PPI systems with galactose increases the drug entrapment efficiency, prolonged circulation and drug 

release as compared to uncoated PPI delivery systems. Another interesting work reported by Agrawal 

[218] demonstrated a method for synthesize galactose-coated PLL dendrimers having polyethyleneglycol 

(PEG-1000) as core. This method consisted on alternating protection and deprotection steps of L-lysine 

by di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (di-BOC) until the formation of peptide dendrimer (G4) took place. Moreover, 



CHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review 

 
- 27 - 

 

they successfully loaded these macromolecules with chloroquine phosphate, which is extensively 

employed for the suppression and treatment of malaria. The internalization studies of uncoated and 

coated drug dendrimer formulations in macrophages revealed almost 5 times reduced phagocytosis due 

to galactose coating. Galactose coated peptide dendrimers   drastically reduced haemolytic activity 

compared to uncoated PLL formulation. Haematological data suggested that galactose-coating strategy 

decrease immunogenicity as compared to uncoated formulations. 

Carbosilanes bearing saccharide residues on their surface were first introduced by Matsuoka et al. [219]. 

An innovative work [220], described the synthesis of glycodendrimer via carbosiloxane formation. In this 

work, a hydrosilylation route for attaching carbohydrate derivatives to carbosilane backbones without 

using any hetero atoms was described.  

Prieto et al. [221] have investigated the cytotoxicity of sulfadiazine complexed with fourth generation 

PAMAM dendrimers. Cell culture studies using fibroblasts (Vero cells) and macrophages (J-774 cells) 

have revealed that the dendrimeric sulfadiazine complexes did not affect membrane integrity at low 

concentrations (0.03 ?M). Moreover, cytotoxicity tests using human intestinal adenocarcinoma cells line 

(Caco-2 cells) results showed that dendrimeric sulfadiazine did not reduce viability of Caco-2 cells over 

the tested concentrations as compared to that for PAMAM (G4). Remarkably, the in vivo study has 

shown that brain and muscle of Wistar rats are the main targets of intravenous administration of 

dendrimeric sulfadiazine, which can be advantegeous for drug delivery applications directed to central 

nervous system.  

For efficient encapsulation and delivery of 5-fluorouracil (anti-cancer drug), Bhadra [222] also exploit the 

surface modification route of PAMAM dendrimers with PEG. PEGylation of the systems was found to 

increase the drug-loading capacity of the nanocarrier, reduce the drug release rate and haemolytic 

toxicity. In another work [223], PEGylated PPI (G5) dendrimers were developed for sustained delivery of 

famotidine, a H2 receptor antagonist. In vivo investigations demonstrated that there was a marked 

difference in the percentage of drug distribution from the bound drug through PEGylated dendrimer 

when compared with the free drug. Similar studies were carried out by Haba et al. [224]. They have 

prepared biocompatible nanocapsules consisting of polyamidoamine (G4) dendrimer having both a PEG 

chain and a methacryloyl group at every chain end of the dendrimer through an L-lysine residue. 

Therefore, these works support previous findings showing that PEGylation can increase circulation time, 

the sustained release of therapeutic molecules and improve haemocompatibility. Recently, Kono et al. 

[225] provided deeper insights on the designing of dendrimer-based carriers for accurate drug delivery. 

They have developed PAMAM dendrimers (G4) that have a glutamic acid (Glu) residue at every chain

end of the dendrimer. Then, to obtain PEG-modified dendrimers with sites for conjugation, PEG chains 

were attached to amino groups of Glu residues. Dox was linked to side chains of the Glu residues by an 

amide bond, [PEG-Glu(Dox)-G4], or hydrazone bond, [PEG-Glu(NHN-Dox)-G4]. The developed 

systems were stable under physiological conditions, and Dox molecules were released from            

PEG-modified dendrimers in acidic environments such as those of endosomes/lysosomes. The Dox-

bearing dendrimers showed much lower toxicity to HeLa cells as compared to free drug. However, it 

was evident that the conjugates with hydrazone bonds exhibited higher cytotoxic effects than those with 

amide bonds. These results suggest the importance of pH-sensitive hydrazone linkage for high 

cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the PEG-modified dendrimers exhibited a similar level of toxicity to that of 

Dox-resistant (SBC-3/ADR100) cells and their parent Dox-sensitive SBC-3 cells. 

Early studies have been performed with peptide dendrimers and other peptide-binding dendrimers, to 

evaluate peptide-protein and protein-protein interactions. These showed that dendrimer-based research 

can be a valuable tool for elucidating these processes. For example, Tam et al. [105] proposed peptide 

dendrimers to act as immunogens, also  known as multiple antigen peptides (MAPs).  

CD derivatives bearing peptides may be useful as carriers for transporting drugs to biological targets 

containing specific peptide receptors. Thus, the peptide bio-recognizability together with the CD host-

guest complexation properties makes such systems suitable templates for the application in site-specific 

drug delivery. Much effort has been made to complex low generation dendrimers with other polymers. 

For example, Dodziuk et al. [226] have reported on their attempts to complex a first generation dendrimer 

having four branches with ?-, ?- or ?-cyclodextrins, however, NMR studies showed that were not 

successful. Muhanna et al. [227] have reported a different strategy. Their study has shown the synthesis 

of tetradecavalent amino acid and peptide dendrimers based on a ?-CD core. These were found to have 

great potential for application in MAP concept as a means to increase the peptide-receptor binding and 

hence improve the site specificity of the drug delivery system. Imae [228] investigated the binding of 

PAMAM dendrimer to sodium hyaluronate (NaHA). They successfully synthesized the PAMAM/NaHA 

complexes. Moreover, the static light scattering data showed that when the dendrimers bind to the 

NaHA chain, the wormlike character of NaHA is scarcely changed at low mixing [NH2]/[COO?] ratios. 

However, the structure of NaHA changed to a rodlike one at high [NH2]/[COO?] values, where the 

terminal numbers of dendrimers exceed at least five times the repeating unit numbers of a NaHA chain. 

They postulated that electrostatic interaction is essential but not sufficient to connect such large 

numbers of dendrimers to NaHA, because the number of amino terminal groups is 42 times larger than 

the number of carboxylates. Therefore, they concluded that hydrogen-bonding interaction, besides the

electrostatic interaction, should play an important role in the formation of these complexes. For rational 

design of intracellular nanocarriers, it is important to better understand the transport mechanisms across 

biological barriers. In general transport of nanosystems is dependent on one hand, on their nature 

namely their location, function and permeability and on the other, on the nature of the nanocarrier 

molecules (e.g. molecular weight, charge, hydrophobicity, flexibility) and geometry [229]. Figure 6 shows 

a simplified representation of the endocytotic route of nanoparticle aimed at act as intracellular reservoir 

of drugs. Ultimately, these are expected to be release inside the cells and both modulate and control the 

cell machinery.

Recently, Perumal et al. [230] have investigated the effect of surface functionality on cellular trafficking of 

dendrimers. In this report, different dendrimers (G4 OH-terminated, G4 amine-terminated and G3.5)

were firstly, labeled with FITC. Results revealed that dendrimers are internalized by human lung 

carcinoma epithelial cells (A549 cell line). Using inhibitory drugs (e.g. sucrose, chlorpromazine, filipin, 

nocodazole and cytochalasins) for endocytosis, they found that nanoparticles uptake is mainly by fluid-

phase endocytosis, independently of the external functionality. Although, significant differences in 

uptake mechanisms were seen. For example, anio-nic dendrimers appear to be mainly internalized by 

caveolae mediated endocytosis in A549 lung epithelial cells, while there were evidences of cationic and 

neutral dendrimers internalization by a non-clathrin, non-caveolae mediated mechanism that may be by 

electrostatic interactions or other non-specific fluid-phase endocytosis. Confocal microscopic studies 

revealed that cationic dendrimers were mostly localized in the endosomes in the cell periphery. By its 

turn, both anionic and neutral dendrimers were found to localize in the lysosomes. These data have 

shown that the surface charge of the dendrimers strongly influences their uptake by cells and 

intracellular localization, thus opening up new possibilities of targeting therapeutic agents to subcellular 

organels. Pisal [231] investigated the permeability of arginine- and ornithine-conjugated PAMAM 

dendrimers (G4) across Caco-2 cell monolayers. Firstly, conjugates were obtained by linking the 

polyamines to the amine groups of the PAMAM dendrimers (G4) using an Fmoc synthetic route, and 

then conjugates were labeled with fluoroscein isothiocyanate (FITC). The in vitro cell culture studies 

revealed that surface-modification of dendrimers increase permeability. The mechanisms by which the 

polyamines improve the permeation of the dendrimers remain unclear. Despite, the authors speculated 

on the disruption of intercellular tigh junctions as one possible mechanism. Similarly, Seib et al. [232] 

have reported on the endocytic properties and intracellular trafficking of both linear and branched PEIs, 

and cationic PAMAM dendrimers (G2-4) in B16F10 murine melanoma cells. All polymers were first 

conjugated to Oregon Green (OG) and carefully characterised in respect of pH- and concentration-

dependence of fluorescence. Flow cytometry studies revealed that uptake rate for PAMAM (G4) was the 

highest, followed by branched PEI, linear PEI, PAMAM (G3) and at last PAMAM (G2). Cells were 

cultured in the presence of the dendrimers and chlorpromazine or wortmannin to assess the 

mechanisms of uptake. The precise mechanisms of PAMAM internalisation were once not totally 

clarified, but the authors suggest that PAMAM (G4) internalisation can be cholesterol-dependent.  

When comparing to traditional macromolecular architectures (i.e. linear, crosslinked, branched), the 

unique features of the dendrimers and dendrimeric systems can improve the cellular uptake, 

bioavailability of therapeutic molecules inside the cells for long time periods, and consequently decrease 

the dosage and frequent re-dosage needs. For developing safer and even more efficient dendrimeric

nanocarriers, there is the need to intensify the comprehensive research on the mechanisms of cellular 

uptake.  

3.2. TISSUE ENGINEERING (TE) APPLICATIONS OF DENDRIMERS AND DENDRONIZED POLYMERS  

In the recent years, great advances have been done in the emerging field of TE and regenerative 

medicine. Many important data have been published, and thus there is a need to overview the most 

recent achievements and scientific considerations in this particular area of research. The objective of 

this section is to highlight the most recent and relevant reports in the field of TE and regenerative 

medicine, and stress its utility and feasibility by giving some examples of successful clinical treatments. 

Due to the multidisciplinary nature of this field we were encouraged to cover many other related issues, 

even if succinctly. The regenerative potential of different cells (and its sources), and the control of its 

functions by means of using different bioactive agents will be discussed. The TE strategies used for the 

regeneration of specific body parts are also addressed as well as the requirements (e.g. cell/material 

interactions and surface chemistry) that should be met for optimal performance of the TE cells-scaffold 

constructs. The role of bioreactors in TE is also briefly discussed. Finally, new promising strategies are 

proposed, namely the use nanocarriers such as dendrimers and dendronized polymers for the 

controlled and targeted delivery of bioactive agents that are aimed at modulate the cells functions such 

as proliferation and differentiation.  

3.2.1. TE strategies: an overview 

In our body there are different cell types, which can be categorized as follows: (i) germ cells, (ii) somatic 

cells, and (iii) stem cells. Germ cells are cells that give rise to gametes, male and female. Somatic cells 

are the specialized ones and make-up the adult body. In their differentiated state they may possess one 

or more copies of the genome, with the exception of erythrocytes which do not possess any. Finally, 

stem cells can be defined as cells that possess the capacity of divide indefinitely (proliferate) in culture 

and potentially may also differentiate into functionally distinct lineages [233]. Stem cells can be grouped 

according to the source or tissue of origin. Alternatively, they can also be classified for their capacity of 

differentiation or “cell plasticity” as: (i) totipotent, i.e. can differentiate in all types of specialized cells of 

the body, including entire fetus and placenta; (ii) pluripotent, i.e. can differentiate in several cells types of 

all three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm), but not the whole organism; (iii) multipotent, 

i.e. can only differentiate in limited type of specialized cells; and (iv) unipotent, i.e. can only give rise to 

one differential cell lineage.

Due to the limited regenerative capacity of the body, there is the need for developing more effective 

treatments to cure the several spontaneous and injuries-related diseases. It is well known that in 

mammalian tissue repair mechanisms results from the activation of pre-existing stem cells or 

progenitors cells. Moreover, the identification of several stem cells sources and their isolation promise to 

revolutionize the concept of regenerative medicine, since allows us to develop numerous cell-based 

therapies.  

In the early 1990s, Langer and Vacanti [234]  coined TE as ‘‘an interdisciplinary field of research that 

applies the principles of engineering and the life sciences towards the development of biological 

substitutes that restore, maintain, or improve tissue function’’. This concept is based on understanding 

of how tissue formation and regeneration occurs, and instead of traditional implantation of new spare 

parts it envisions to induce new functional tissues. To accomplish this goal, three main therapeutic 

strategies have been proposed [235]: (i) implantation at injury site of freshly isolated cells (e.g. own 

patient cells) or cultured cells (differentiated cells alone or in combination with stem cells, for example); 

(ii) in situ tissue regeneration, i.e. implantation of a scaffold at the diseased/damaged tissue aimed at 

promote healing/repair by the patients own cells;  and (iii) implantation of tissues obtained from 

combining cells and scaffolds that are cultured in vitro with or without the presence of bioactive 

molecules. Thus, the basic TE triad consists of cells, scaffolds and bioactive agents which can be used 

separately or in combination. By its turn, regenerative medicine uses the cell and tissue engineering 

principles for the regeneration of damaged/disead body tissues.  

For cell therapy, either differentiated (e.g. autologous chondrocytes) [236] or undifferentiated (e.g. stem 

cells) cells [233,237] can be used. Despite, the use of stem cells in clinical practice is still limited since 

raises many problems and concerns, specially a sub-type of stem cells, the embryonic stem (ES) cells. 

This problematic is not only due to ethical/religious issues [238,239], safety [240,241] or technical limitations, 

but also to the legislative/regulatory constraints [233,242]. Adult stem cells are seen as an alternative to ES 

cells, as their clinical use seems to be safe, without complications and major ethical issues concerns 

[243,244]. Stem cells can proliferate and differentiate beyond the tissues in which they normally reside or 

may be artificially placed [245]. In fact, it has been shown that bone marrow-derived stem cells cannot 

only reconstitute bone marrow but are capable of forming several types of mesenchymal tissues, 

including bone [246], muscle cells [247], lung and gut [248]. For example, cell sheet transplantation has been 

proving to be a breakthrough therapeutic strategy for treatment myocardial infarction [249], among others.  

The intensive research efforts and technological advances allowed to identify and isolate different types 

of stem cells from germ cells, embryo, fetus (e.g. fetal blood, placenta and umbilical cord blood), and

adult tissues and organs [250-255]. In addition, it was reported the isolation of stem cells derived from 

amniotic fluid that express embryonic and adult stem cell markers [256]. The amniotic fluid-derived stem 

cells were found to be pluripotent, meaning that has the potential to differentiate into cell types 

representing each embryonic germ layer, including cells of adipogenic, osteogenic, myogenic, 

endothelial, neuronal and hepatic lineages. 

Interestingly, differentiated cells can be reprogrammed to a pluripotent state by transfer of nuclear 

contents into oocytes, by fusion with ES cells, and for male germ cells by cell culture alone. Recently, 

Takahashi and Yamanaka [257,258] demonstrated that pluripotent stem cells can be directly generated 

from fibroblast cultures, the so-called induced pluripotent stem (iPs) cells by retrovirus-mediated 

transfection with four transcription factors, namely Oct3/4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4, under ES cell culture 

conditions. The four factors, however, can not fully explain iPs cell induction [259]. Though, this step 

further has major implications in regenerative medicine as for the first time, it is possible to create 

pluripotent cells directly from somatic cells of humans [260]. 

For in situ tissue regeneration and tissue implantation there is the need to use temporary matrices for 

tissue growth, the so-called scaffolds [261,262]. Though, as stressed by different authors [263,264] the 

strategy to implant cells with scaffolds (constructs) is oftenly considered wiser, as it allow a rapid and 

correct vascularization of the tissue to be repaired. Scaffolds with special design [265], tunable 

degradability and mechanical properties [266,267], biocompatible and capable of sustaining dense 

populations of cells [268,269] are being developed. The role of the scaffold is temporary, but crucial to the 

success of the therapeutic strategy. Thus, the criterious selection of a biomaterial is of major 

importance. Synthetic biomaterials have been processed in a variety of matrices [270-272], other used for 

their bioactive ability [273], and new cell-scaffold constructs strategies [274,275] are being designed to allow 

the development of biological and mechanically functional artificial tissues/organs.  

Scaffolds architecture, namely porosity, pore size and interconnectivity of the biomaterial scaffolds are 

also known to play a critical role in tissue formation [276]. However, the balanced porosity/mechanical 

performance of the scaffolds is an issue that cannot be forgotten, and thus should also be exploited 

further.  

Surface properties of the scaffolds also dictate the response of cells and possibly tunning cell behaviour, 

and promote cell adhesion, cell orientation and cell motility [277-279], etc. Various techniques have been 

used to fabricate micropatterned surfaces of different materials, including microlithography [280], 

microcontact printing [281,282], and many others.

Growth factors (GFs) and other bioactive molecules may be provided to control the cellular functions 

either from culture media [283,284] or simply by incorporation into the scaffold [285,286] which can be more 

advantageous. The cells on their scaffold need to be typically cultured in custom-designed bioreactors 

[236,287] as mechanical forces may be required [288,289], either through fluid stresses or structural stresses, 

in order to provide further stimuli to cell function. Quite oftenly, this process may take days or weeks 

until it forms a tissue similar to that aimed at repair/regenerate. With simple tissues only one cell type 

may be involved (e.g. chondrocytes in cartilage repair), but in other situations, more than one cell type 

may be needed, as tissue to be regenerated consists of multiple structures (e.g. osteochondral tissues) 

[290,291]. Thus, this will require considerable sophistication with respect to the bioreactor system itself. To 

achieve superior tissue formation in vitro, great efforts have been made to develop and improve a wide 

variety of bioreactors, including  spinner flasks [292,293], recirculation bioreactors [294,295], rotating wall 

vessels (e.g. uni- and bi-axial bioreactor rotation) [296-298], among others. 

3.2.2. Dendrimers and dendronized polymers in TE 

The use of dendrimers architectures in cells and TE applications is still in its infancy. Few examples 

have been reported, and these are mainly related with applications in cell adhesion studies as 

nanopatterning [299]. Interestingly, ligand-modified dendrimers have been proposed for use as 

substratum for cell culture and high performance  bioartificial  organs [300]. 

On the other hand, it has been reported [87] that when a dendrimer reaches a certain generation (a 

variable factor according to the dendritic structure but in general equal to or greater than G4), significant 

conformational change occurs, and the structure assumes a densely packed globular shape. Several 

authors [79,87,301] have been discussing the potential of tunning dendrimers to develop macromolecules 

that can mimic globular proteins. In fact, partial core shell-filled tecto(dendrimers) can be obtained by 

covalently assembling PAMAM dendrimers (nucleophilic or electrophilic) around other electrophilic or 

nucleophilic core dendrimers [302]. This feature allows many new technological applications. One 

possibility is to take advantage of dendrimer architecture towards resembling the role of different 

proteins in the cells culture media. For example, dendrimers may be a valuable tool on the development 

of synthetic serum-free culture media and adequate substratum for superior cell culturing. Fluorescence 

spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and fluorescent probes studies [303,304] showed that 

dendrimers interact with proteins giving rise to stable complexes by establishing both electrostatic and 

non-electrostatic interactions.

Kim et al. [305] have also investigated the response of human epithelial cells to dendrimer-immobilized 

substrates with or without D-glucose displayed as a terminal ligand. When the topographic surface 

possessed a roughness of 4 nm epithelial cells cultured on naked dendrimer surface without D-glucose 

were somewhat stretched in their morphology compared with those on a nonmodified plain surface. 

However, for the roughness values higher than 4 nm cell stretching was inhibited, thus resulting in the 

predominant existence of round-shaped cells. The change in cell morphology was quite evident on the 

surfaces with D-glucose-displayed dendrimers. Fluorescence microscopic observation showed that 

when the roughness value increased up to 4.5 nm on these surfaces, an enhancement of cell stretching 

occurs. These results suggested that surface roughness and D-glucose display induce changes in 

cellular morphology caused by the cytoskeleton formation accompanied by marked cell elongation. 

Therefore, this study demonstrated that dendrimer surfaces can offer a promising design for optimizing 

cells culture conditions. 

In the work reported by Benhabbour and colleagues [306], it was demonstrated that cells showed a 

greater affinity for the dendronized surfaces as compared to the Au surfaces (control). Moreover, in vitro 

cell culture studies with mouse 3T3 fibroblasts showed that cell attachment was diminished for the PEG-

grafted Au surfaces as compared to the control Au and G1-G4 dendronized surfaces. These results 

showed that dendronized surfaces presenting a large number of hydroxyl groups can be a reliable 

alternative to the use of peptides to promote cell adhesion and proliferation. 

3.2.2.1. Bone TE 

Bone is a very dense and specialized form of connective tissue, highly specialized in the several regions 

that constitutes it and acts as a support for the body. Bone lesions above a critical-sized segmental 

defect still remain a huge challenge to reconstructive surgery and regenerative medicine. This is mainly 

due to the fact that bone has a limited ability to heal [307,308]. In many clinical situations there is the need 

for a surgical intervention and use of autografts [309,310], allografts or xenografts [310,311] transplantation. 

Still, the preferred clinical strategy is the autologous transplantation, since it avoids the problem of 

immune rejection [312] and consequent administration of drugs for immunosupression of the host [313]. 

Therefore, we can state that the currently available treatment possibilities are far from being a truly ideal 

solution. Recently, it has been applied the TE principles [314], i.e. by seeding bone marrow stem cells 

onto scaffolds (constructs) [315] or prostheses [316] to recreate an regenerative environment at the defect 

area and achieve a superior bone healing. Despite the important advances, the performance of 

constructs remains limited, in part due to the need of optimize cell culture techniques [317]. To circumvent

these limitations great efforts are focused on developing novel nanocarriers aimed at modulate cells 

behaviour. Previously, our group [184] has investigated investigated if the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles can play a crucial role in the regulation of osteogenesis, in vitro. In this work, 

the uptake efficiency and mechanism of FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles using rat 

bone marrow stromal cells (RBMSCs) was investigated. Fluorescence microscopy studies revealed that 

the developed nanocariers could be efficiently internalized by RBMSCs, after a few hours (Figure 7). 

Flow cytometry studies revealed that RBMSCs cultured in the presence of colchicine, an endocytotic 

inhibitor, reduce the internalization of the nanoparticles. These data showed that uptake by cells was 

primarily via an active endocytosis mechanism, but not exclusively. Moreover, the biochemical data 

demonstrated that the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were not cytotoxic and 

promote osteogenesis (2-D system).

Figure 7. Fluorescence microscopy image of the RBMSCs cultured in the presence of FITC-labeled 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles (green) for 7 days. Nuclear DNA and cytoskeleton were 

labeled with Hoechst 33258 (blue) and Texas-Red phalloidin (red), respectively. 

Recent studies [318,319] have shown that combination of hydroxyapatite (HAp) scaffolds, bone marrow 

stromal cells and Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer enhanced osteogenesis in vitro (3-D systems), 

and de novo bone formation as compared to controls, in vivo (Figure 8). Remarkably, animal studies 

have shown that the novel Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles may be beneficial as 

intracellular nanocarrier, supplying Dex in a regimented manner, while avoiding the need of culturing the 

cells in vitro for long periods of time. Moreover, this strategy allows modulate and direct stem cells 

differentiation towards the osteogenic phenotype, and enhance in vivo proteoglycan ECM synthesis and

de novo bone formation. It has also been exploited dendritic monomers as components in dentistry 

applications to allow polymerization to extend further, as incomplete polymerized matrixes can cause 

irritation, allergy or toxicological effects [320]. In fact, photopolymerized dendritic copolymers and 

particulate filler composites have been combined to be used as dental restorative materials [321]. In that 

study, dendritic monomers were found to enhance the copolymerization of methyl methacrylate and to 

lower the viscosity, which can be advantegous to improve biocompatibility of the fillers.

representative areas of the HAp scaffold (S), de novo bone formation (NB), fibrous tissue (F). Black 

arrows reveal the cells lining which is suggestive of active osteoblasts. Osteocytes can also be 

visualized (*). 

3.2.2.2. Cartilage TE 

In the human body, it can be found two main types of cartilage, namelly the “unstressed” and “stressed” 

cartilage, in ear and joints, respectively. General features of cartilage tissue includes: (i) a small number 

of chondrocytes (less than 10% of the weight of articular cartilage) with low proliferation rate and having 

both catabolic and anabolic functions; (ii) a high content of water (75% of the wet weight of articular 

cartilage); (iii) an abundant ECM composed by proteoglycan and different types of collagens (mainly 

type II), corresponding to 15-30 and 50-73% of the solid ECM weight, respectively; and (iv) possess no 

nerve and vascular systems [322,323]. Although a classical wound healing response is initiated, articular 

cartilage lesions are repaired without complete restoration of the components and architecture of the

native tissue. This is explained by the fact of being an avascular tissue, regenerative cells cannot 

migrate to the defect void unless the lesion goes beyond the subchondral bone plate [324,325]. Therefore, 

a regenerative response will be only possible when it is provided an artificial access by the marrow [326]. 

This consideration is subjacent on several clinical strategies that are currently employed on the 

treatment of small cartilage lesions namely, the subchondral abrasion, Pridie’s perforations, micro-

fracture, and transplantation of osteochondral plugs [325,327-329]. Although, in most cases after clinical 

intervention the repaired tissue tends to degenerate and occur the formation of the undesired 

fibrocartilage [324,330,331]. Many attempts have been made to develop biomaterials for cartilage 

repair/regeneration. Few have exploited the advantages of dendrimers for this type of applications. 

Sontjens and colleagues [332] have synthesized a photocrosslinkable hydrogel scaffold for cartilage 

repair based on triblock copolymer consisting of PEG core and methacrylated-poly(glycerol-succinic 

acid) (PLGSA) terminal blocks. In vitro chondrocyte encapsulation studies demonstrated that the 

developed hydrogels supported synthesis of proteoglycans and type II collagen, which denote 

cartilaginous extracellular matrix formation. Morever, encapsulated chondrocytes showed no signs of 

dedifferentiation. Despite the promising results in vitro, the authors discussed the need to improve 

mechanical properties and tailor the degradation rate of the developed hydrogels for the superior 

performance of the hydrogels, in vivo.  

3.2.2.3. Ocular wounds 

Another example of dendrimer applications in TE is related with the attempts to improve the biological 

response of different biomaterials. In another study [42], laminin-based peptide YIGSR was introduced 

into the dendrimer-collagen hydrogel by linking the peptide to the residual dendrimer amine groups. The 

incorporated YIGSR peptide promoted the adhesion and proliferation of the corneal epithelial cells 

cultures onto the collagen hydrogel, in vitro. Moreover, neurite extension and nerve cell density was 

enhanced on these materials relative to unmodified gels or controls. This work is an unprecedented 

example of the ability to tune the biological function through the dendrimer crosslinker and a new 

strategy towards obtaining polymer-based tissue-engineering scaffolds with improved biological 

performance.  

Inspired by the functional significance of collagen in nature and its remarkable physiological roles, Khew 

et al. [333] have developed enzymatically crosslinked collagen-mimetic dendrimers. These were obtained 

in two-step procedure: (i) collagen-mimetic peptides supplemented with a cell-binding sequence 

(GFOGER) and enzyme-specific crosslinking domains (EDGFFKI and APQQEA) were conjugated onto 



CHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review 

 
- 39 - 

 

a PAMAM dendrimers (G2), resulting in a crosslinkable collagen-mimetic dendrimer, and (ii) enzyme-

mediated crosslinking the different collagen-mimetic dendrimers by tissue transglutaminase. Collagen-

mimetic dendrimers were first assessed for their cytotoxicity and then adhesion studies were carried out 

using L929 mouse fibroblasts and a hepatoma cell line (Hep3B cells), respectively. Results were 

indicative of the non-cytotoxic nature of the polymers. The adhesion studies have proven that enzymatic 

protein crosslinking, which is a common physiological event in the extracellular environment, can 

significantly improve cell adhesion on the novel collagen-like biomaterial. Moreover, it was observed that 

combining of collagen-like structural domain and biologically relevant epitopes (e.g. cell-binding 

sequence and enzyme-substrates) into the molecular design of a biomimetic collagen could be a 

promising approach for mimicking more closely its biological function. 

Repair of wounds after traumatic or surgical injury is of significant clinical and research importance. For 

example, corneal wounds arise from surgical procedures (e.g. transplants, incisions for cataract removal 

and intraocular lens implantation, laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis), infections (ulcers), and traumatic 

injury (lacerations, perforations). Nowadays, these wounds are repaired using nylon sutures but this 

technique is not ideal because the suture material does not actively participate in healing and the 

procedure is inherently invasive. Therefore, alternative strategies using adhesive polymers have been 

tested. For example, Duan et al. [334] crosslinked collagen with multifunctional dendrimers. PPI 

octaamine dendrimers (G2) were used to generate highly crosslinked collagen hydrogels with 

mechanical properties that would make it appropriate for use as a corneal TE scaffold.  

For the superior performance of ocular wounds, hydrogel adhesives should meet some criteria, namely: 

(i) adhere to the moist corneal surface and seal the wound to withstand high intraocular pressures; (ii) 

possess adequate rheological properties to permit a controlled and rapid placement; (iii) ability to seal 

the corneal wound in a controlled manner and restore the intraocular pressure; (iv) maintain the 

structural integrity of the eye and possess a refractive properties resembling as much as possible to 

native cornea; (v) be biocompatible and provide a microbial barrier; and (vi) be biodegraded or 

bioabsorbed on a time scale consistent with tissue regeneration.  

Grinstaff and coworkers [335] have developed a set of dendrimeric adhesives composed of dendrimers of 

different generation (G1, G2 G3) combined with PEG, glycerol, and succinic acid for finding application 

in the repair of corneal wounds. The polymer was modified to contain terminal methacrylate (MA) 

groups, [G1]-PGLSA-MA)2-PEG. Two strategies to develop the ocular adhesives were explored: (i) the 

use of a photocrosslinking reaction to form the dendrimer-PGLSA-MA)2-PEG, and (ii) the use a peptide 

ligation reaction to couple the individual dendrimers together to form the lysine-based dendron with

terminal cysteines adhesive hydrogel G2-(Lys)3-Cys4) and PEG-dialdehyde (PEG-DA). Both strategies 

strategies afford hydrogels that are adhesive, transparent, elastic, hydrophilic, and soft. The in vivo 

studies in chicken eyes have shown that the photocrosslinkable ([G1]-PGLSA-MA)2-PEG adhesive 

completely sealed the linear lacerations on post-operative day. By its turn, the histological studies 

demonstrated that wounds sealed with these adhesive gels appeared to be more complete as 

compared to sutured wounds, after 28 days. By its turn, the dendron ([G2]-(Lys)3-Cys4) and PEG-DA 

show to be effective on the repair of corneal lacerations and required less surgical time than 

conventional suturing, ex vivo. The advantage of the photocrosslinked gels lies on the ability of the 

polymer to crosslink and adhere to the tissue where the clinician directs the light. However, the limitation 

is the potential risks with ocular damage when using light. Thus, the crosslinking strategy based on 

peptide bonding show to be more attractive since it can avoid the need for light and the reaction is 

performed at neutral pH; thus the polymer can be crosslinked upon placement on the tissue. 

3.2.2.4. Diagnosis and inflammation 

In autograft transplantation, biopsies are performed harvesting the smallest amount of tissue possible 

from patients to prepare starter cells. Oftenly, tissue is lised and cells are expanded. During culturing 

changes in intracellular states can cause variation in individuality in a cell population and cells behavior. 

Moreover, due to terminal differentiation cellular senescence can occur. Therefore, there is the need to 

investigate the cellular status, prior implantation into the patient. In this context, Hata el al. [336] have 

proposed a novel image analysis methodology based on the observation of the partial anchoring of the 

cells to a glucose-dendrimer immobilized culture surface as a mean to evaluate the formation of the 

cellular cytoskeleton in a non-invasive manner. In this study, formation of the cellular cytoskeleton was 

correlated with the growth cellular potential. This innovative method allowed observation of the cells 

morphology, and conclude on the regenerative potential of the cells to be used in TE strategies. 

In the last few years, there has been a great interest [337,338] in the mediators responsible for the 

selective recruitment and activation of immune cells at inflammatory site. Among these mediators, 

chemokines have received particular attention in in vivo studies involving the investigation of cytokine-

associated responses to biomaterials [234]. Chemokines are a large family of small (7,000-15,000 Da, 

from 67 to 127 amino acids in length), structurally related heparin-binding proteins, which are classified 

into 4 subfamilies according to the configuration of cysteine residues near the N-terminus, depending on 

whether the first 2 cysteines are separated (CXC, CX3C) or not (CC, C) by an intervening amino acid 

[339]. 



CHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review 

 
- 41 - 

 

Chemokine messages are decoded by specific receptors [340-342] that initiate signal transduction events, 

leading to a multitude of cellular responses, including chemotaxis and activation of inflammatory and 

bone cells. Thus, the development of synthetic chemoattractants by linking small peptide sequences 

that are known to interact with chemokine receptors to dendrimers and, when appropriate, chemokine 

inhibitors [343] can be envisioned. In regenerative medicine, the development of dendrimer-based 

chemoattractants can find interesting applications towards recruiting stem cells [344]. This unexploited 

area can open up new therapeutic avenues, not only for treating autoimmune diseases but also, to be 

used in innovative TE strategies, since it can lead to the superior repair/regeneration of 

damaged/diseased tissues by endogenous cells.  

3.3. CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS) APPLICATIONS OF DENDRIMERS AND DENDRONIZED POLYMERS  

In spite of deeply studied, the brain and the central nervous system (CNS)  still encase many mysteries, 

and therefore its pathologies still represent a major challenge for biomedical science.  

Neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s disease, stroke, brain tumours or 

multiple sclerosis (MS) are among leading debilitating diseases within our society to which a feasible 

and long lasting therapeutic approach is yet to be found. In the next lines we will give a short overview 

on the CNS properties, as well as how drug delivery systems, and in particular dendrimers, may be 

used to develop strategies that hinder some of the symptoms of the above referred therapies.  

3.3.1. The central nervous system: basic concepts 

The nervous system is structurally divided in two sections [345,346]: (i) central nervous system, and (ii) 

peripheric nervous system (PNS). The first is constituted by the brain and spinal cord, and is considered 

to be the “command post” of the nervous system. It is responsible for the interpretation and processing 

of the information that is hand over by the PNS, which is constituted by an array of nerves, that  are 

spread out through the body and connected to the spinal cord,  and have as main function to gather 

information from the outer/inner environment. In this sense the spinal cord can be looked as an 

information “highway” transmitting information from and into the brain, playing therefore a leading role 

on the normal functioning of the CNS. 

From the cell biology point of view the CNS is composed of two cell types, neurons and glial cells.    

Neurons are considered to be the structural and functional unit of the CNS. Its main characteristic is 

based on the ability to respond and conduct electrochemical impulses, being their actions mainly 

mediated through the release of chemical regulators known as neurotransmitters [346,347]. Although

neurons can considerably change in shape and size, they are normally divided in three areas: the cell 

body or soma, dendrites and the axons [346].  The cell body, as its name implies is the area where all 

nucleus and the remaining organelles are located, and therefore is considered as the “nutritional centre” 

of the neuron, as it is the place where macromolecules found to be essential to neuronal survival are 

produced [348]. The dendrites can be looked as extensions of the cell body that provide an extended 

surface area for the reception of the nervous impulses, transmitted by neighbouring neurons, to the cell 

bodies [347]. Finally, the axon can also be looked as an extension protruding from the cell body, although 

much more differentiated than the dendrites. It is through this structure that the nervous impulses are 

conducted from the cell body to the axon terminals, where neurotransmitters will be released to adjacent 

neurons to an area denominated as synaptic cleft [346,347]. The axon is normally surrounded by a 

lipoproteic sheath of myelin. The latter acts mainly as an electric insulator, allowing in this sense a faster 

transmission of the nervous impulse. The areas of the brain that are rich in myelinated fibers are known 

as white matter while the areas containing the cell bodies are known as grey matter [346,347]. 

The glial cells are the second cell type of the central nervous system. They are more abundant than the 

neurons. Glial cells are mainly involved in supporting functions, such as the maintenance of the ionic 

balance of neurons, the modulation of the synaptic transmission and the re-establishment of the 

neurological function upon neuronal damage, although, this is not always possible, as in the case of 

spinal cord injury (SCI). Three cell populations can be found among glial cells [346]: (i) astrocytes, (ii) 

oligodendrocytes, and (iii) microglial cells. 

Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cell type. They are commonly located in the vicinities of blood 

vessels and neurons, and are, among others, responsible for mediating the synaptic transmission by 

removing, from the synaptic cleft, neurotransmitters that will be later on “recycled” and made available 

again to neurons.  

Oligodendrocytes are the cells involved on the production of the myelin sheath, that encases the 

neurons, and thus are of the utmost importance within the CNS [345]. 

Microglial cells play an important role within the CNS, as they are considered to be the immune 

mediators of the latter, possessing a macrophage-like behaviour, eliminating death tissue and cells by 

phagocytosis, as well foreign agents. They possess two states, which mainly reflect their state of 

activation. Ramified microglial cells are considered to be in the resting state. They are characterized by 

possessing long cytoplasmastic processes, a small cell body and few lysosomes. On the other hand 

activated microglia is characterized by ameboid morphology, with a large cell body and a large number 

of lysosomes, which indicates a high phagocytotic capacity [349].

3.3.2. Blood brain barrier (BBB) 

The brain is protected from the rest of the body by structures known as barriers that most oftenly 

represent a major hurdle for the delivery of diagnostic and therapeutic agents [350]. In fact most of the 

systemically administered drugs do not enter the brain in adequate amounts, which most of the times 

leads to an increase of dosage that can lead to undesirable side effects. The most well known barrier is 

the BBB, which consists of “walls” of capillaries that separate brain from the circulating blood [350]. Its low 

permeability is mostly attributed to brain micro-vessel endothelial (BMVEC) cells which form tight 

junctions and have a low pinocytic potential [350-353]. Moreover, the BBB is also formed by astrocytic 

processes, leptomeningeal cells and a parenchymal membrane that overall isolate the brain from 

unwanted molecules [350]. However, not all molecules are “unwanted” by the BBB. For instance, the 

latter provides for selective transport of small molecules, lipophilic and low molecular weight 

compounds, polypeptides ad even cells to the CNS. In particular, nutrients and endogenous compounds 

such as amino acids, glucose, essential fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, electrolytes' are effectively 

carried by the BBB. Most of these processes are based on receptor-mediated endocytosis [351]. 

Receptors such as insulin, transferrin, endothelial growth factors, amino acids, glucose (GLUT 1) 

transporter are known to be expressed by the BBB, for example [351]. In this sense the BBB can be seen 

as regulatory membrane, which selectively allows the passage of essential molecules to the 

homeostasis of the CNS, while inhibiting what is believed to be “harmful” ones. Thus, when designing a 

strategy to deliver a therapeutic agent into the CNS one must understand the properties of the BBB in 

order to allow an efficient delivery nanocarrier to the target site (s). 

3.3.3. Dendrimers and dendronized polymers in CNS   

As referred before drug delivery to the CNS is tremendously challenging. Initially films, tablets, 

microspheres and intracranial polymeric materials were tested for these applications. However, as 

recently reviewed by Kabanov and Gendelman [350], such strategies had limited success namely due to 

their invasiveness, inflammatory responses to implants and limited distribution of therapeutic molecules 

around the implantation site. It was in this context that nanomedicine based approaches started to be 

put forward as a possible solution. Within these one can found liposome’s [354,355], polymeric 

nanoparticles [356,357], and nanogels [358]. Particularly interesting for the above referred applications are 

also dendrimers [359]. Surprisingly, their application to the CNS is also still quite scarce. Nevertheless, 

some nice examples can be drawn from the literature of the possible applications of these systems for 

drug delivery in the CNS. For instance Suppatone and co-workers [360,361] suggested the use of 



CHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review 
 

 
 
- 44 - 
 

dendrimers for the removal of prion effection. In a couple of studies it was reported that branched 

polyamines, including PAMAM, PPI and  PEI dendrimers, were able to purge PrPSc, the protease-

resistant isoform of the prion protein, from scrapie-infected neuroblastoma (ScN2a) cells in culture. The 

removal of PrPSc by these compounds depended mainly on both the concentration of branched 

polymer and the duration of exposure. Structure-activity analysis revealed that a high surface density of 

primary amino groups was required for polyamines to eliminate PrPSc effectively from cells. In a 

subsequent study it was also demonstrated that exposure of ScN2a cells to 3 mg.mL-1 of PPI (G4) for 4 

weeks not only reduced PrPSc to a level undetectable by Western blot but also eradicated prion 

infectivity as determined by  bioassays  in mice. Moreover exposure of purified RML prions to branched 

polyamines in vitro disaggregated the prion rods, reduced the ?-sheet content of PrP 27-30, and 

rendered PrP 27-30 susceptible to proteolysis. 

Cationic phoshorous dendrimers have also been proposed for the same applications, also through 

inhibition of fibril assembly [362].  Spectrofluorometric assays with thioflavin T (ThT) and Fourier 

transformed infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy show that these class of phosphorous dendrimers were able 

to clearly interfere with PrP 185-208 aggregation process by both slowing down the formation of 

aggregates (by causing a decrease of the nucleation rate) and by lowering the final amount of amyloid 

fibrils, a common hallmark of conformational diseases. In fact, time-course experiments demonstrated 

that phosphorus dendrimers were able to remove quickly existing PrPSc molecules and the clearance 

occurred within 4 hours of treatment [115]. The mechanism behind these actions is mostly unknown. 

However, similarly to what happens with PAMAM dendrimers, the breakage of oligomers or whole fibrils 

caused by dendrimers has probably a strong role on the observed phenomena. A similar report was 

also put forward by Klajnert et al. [114]. In this particular study, PAMAM dendrimers (G3) were used to 

control the nucleation rate of amyloid plaques. The outcome of these studies revealed that dendrimers 

can modulate the aggregation process by affecting the nucleation rate at low concentrations. However, 

at higher concentrations it seemed that dendrimers promoted the elongation of this nucleation chains. 

Therefore, the interest in the reported effect of dendrimers has to be considered within the ongoing 

search for compounds that can affect amyloid formation and in relation to the structural intermediates in 

this process which are responsible for the cytotoxic effects. In this sense low dendrimer concentrations 

could contribute to a decrease of the lifetime of low molecular weight intermediates and contribute to 

decrease the potential cytotoxic effects of the peptides. For instance Patel et al. [363] described the use 

of modified PAMAM dendrimers for Alzheimers' disease. In this particular case sialic-acid-conjugated 



CHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review 

 
- 45 - 

 

PAMAM dendrimers using a physiologically relevant attachment of the sialic acid to the dendrimeric 

termini were prepared. 

Another route to use dendrimers for CNS related applications, namely for transfection purposes, is by 

coating the latter with specific peptides. An example of such an approach was the one presented by Kim 

and colleagues [364,365], in which arginine-grafted PAMAM dendrimers were used. In this case these 

PAMAM-Arg dendrimers were complexed with expression of both a reporter gene (luciferase expression 

plasmid pCN-Luci) and a high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) shRNA transgene-expressing plasmid for 

gene knock down. Results revealed that these PAMAM-Arg/DNA complexes showed particularly high 

transfection efficiencies and low cytotoxicity in primary cortical cells, as compared to other gene carriers 

such as native PAMAM. 

Other classes of dendrimers have also been purposed for CNS regenerative medicine, such as those 

based on polyesters. In a report put forward by Dhanikula and colleagues [195,359] it was suggested the 

use of polyether-copolyester (PEPE) dendrimers conjugated with D-glucosamine and loaded with 

methotrexate (MTX), in order to allow a better delivery across the BBB. Results revealed that the 

efficacy of MTX-loaded dendrimers was established against U87 MG and U 343 MGa cells (two glioma 

cell lines). In vitro studies revealed that glucosylated dendrimers were found to be endocytosed in 

significantly higher amounts than nonglucosylated dendrimers by both the cell lines. Moreover, the 

amount of MTX-transported across an in vitro model of the BBB was three to five times more after 

loading in the dendrimers, which indicates that glucosylation further increased the cumulative 

permeation of dendrimers across BBB and hence increased the amount of MTX available across it. This 

work showed a different set of dendrimers as well as different strategy to potentate their delivery across 

the BBB. However, it should be looked with caution as only in vitro models were used and therefore the 

in vivo proof of concept is yet to be demonstrated. A similar strategy (e.g. cell targeted particles) was 

followed by Wu et al.  [366], which have developed a vehicle for boron neutron capture therapy (BNTC), 

instead of MTX. Similarly to what happened before a heavily boronated PAMAM dendrimer was 

chemically linked to C225 by means of the heterobifunctional reagents N-succinimidyl 3-(2-

pyridyldithio)-propionate and N-(k-maleimido undecanoic acid)-hydrazide. Initial in vitro studies revealed 

that the already mentioned F98EGFR glioma cells specifically internalize the particles when compared 

to receptor negative F98 wild-type cells. Further in vivo studies were conducted by stereotactically 

implanting F98EGFR cells into the brains of Fischer rats. The targeted boronated dendrimers were 

administered 14 days after either convection enhanced delivery (CED) or direct intratumoral (i.t.) 

injection. Results revealed that not only the targeted dendrimers were receptor specific in vivo, but that 



CHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review 
 

 
 
- 46 - 
 

also animals that were exposed to the tested therapy disclose higher survival rated when compared to 

controls. In this sense it appears that this strategy for using dendrimers as targeted particles for 

therapeutic usage is more favorable than the former. Another in vitro study [367] described yet another 

set of polyester based dendrimers denominated as PLGSA. The results reported are quite scarce 

regarding CNS applications, but still it was demonstrated that these dendrimers could encapsulate 

camptothecins and could be internalize by glioblastoma cells (SF-268 cell line). Finally, another study 

[368] suggested a possible source of delivery vehicles based on dendrimers denominated as 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. Experiments with post-natal hippocampal neurons and 

cortical glial cells revealed that both cell populations were able to taken up the CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles. The internalization rates changed according to the cell populations, reaching a 

maximum peak after 48 hours of incubation. Overall astrocytes and microglial cells disclosed higher 

internalization rates (around 100% of the total cell sub-population) followed by neurons and 

oligodendrocytes (up to 80-90% of the observed cells). Further experiments for periods of up to 7 days 

revealed that the periodical addition of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles was needed to maintain 

the levels of internalization. Finally it was also observed that cell viability and proliferation were not 

significantly affected by the presence of the above referred nanoparticles.  These results were quite 

promising, but similarly to what it was described for other studies herein described, further in vivo proof 

of concept needs to be done. 

3.4. GENE DELIVERY APPLICATIONS OF DENDRIMERS AND DENDRONIZED POLYMERS 

The  ability  to  transfer  genetic  material efficiently,  into  the  nucleus  and  cytoplasm  of eukaryotic  

cells  may  allow  treatment  of  a  variety  of  genetic  disorders.  There are two types of vectors to gene 

delivery: (i) viral and (ii) non-viral. Viral-mediated DNA vehicles (infection) have played a major role in 

gene therapeutics. Unfortunately, initial enthusiasm associated to the high infection yields, has been 

tempered by growing concerns regarding the safety issues such as toxicity, immunogenicity and 

oncogenicity [369,370]. On the other hand, synthetic DNA delivery systems “transfection” provides potential 

alternatives for gene therapy and DNA vaccination. Major drawback of current transfection technology is 

the low efficiency compared to infection techniques, although new materials are being exploited. 

Genetic material  is  usually  imported  into  the  cell  by  endocytosis  where,  via  the  endosomes,  it  

may  be  transported to  lysosomes,  to  other  intracellular  membrane  compartments  or  to  the 

cytosol. Thus, they first reach mildly acidic endosomes (pH 5.0-6.5) and then end up in lysosomes 

where they face much lower pH conditions and possible enzymatic degradation. Therefore, the 



CHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review 

 
- 47 - 

 

importance of transferring genetic material into the cytosol is an extremely important process in the 

development of effective gene therapies. Moreover, transport of the gene into the nucleus must occur 

without imparting damage/inactivation from the vehicle itself. This renewed the interest in pH-responsive 

dendrimeric nanocarriers as a mean to enable these macromolecules to reach their subcellular targets. 

Dendrimers play a significant role in the development of non-viral vectors for gene delivery due to the 

high charge density and tunable surface functional groups, thus allowing optimize condensation and 

formation of nanostructures with DNA, the so-called “dendriplexes”. Amine-terminated PAMAM 

dendrimers (polycationic) can interact with negatively charged phosphate groups of nucleic acids. This 

ensures consistent formation of transfection complexes. In fact, the transfection reagent called 

SuperFectTM consisting of activated dendrimers is commercially available. Activated dendrimers can 

carry higher amounts of genetic material as compared to that of viruses. SuperFect-DNA complexes are 

characterised by high stability and provide more efficient transport of DNA into the nucleus than 

liposomes. It has been advanced that the high transfection efficiency of dendrimers may not only be due 

to their well-defined shape but may also be caused by the low pK of the amines (3.9 and 6.9). The low 

pK permit the dendrimer to buffer the pH change in the endosomal-lysosomal compartment. This can be 

beneficial since it can direct towards polymeric swelling, thus allowing disruting the membrane of the 

organelle and promoting the complex release or DNA itself. Therefore, they have an intrinsic 

endosomolytic escape capacity, or can mediate their escape by degradable spacers. Another 

advantage is that these vectors can also prevent fast degradation of DNA by endo- and exo-nucleases. 

PAMAM and other cationic dendrimers such as PPI, thus fulfill these requirements. Initial work by Szoka 

and colleagues [371] have shown that the three dimensional spherical structure of the PAMAM 

dendrimers (G5) could be broken by heating and, surprisingly the fractured dendrimers led to significant 

enhanced transfection efficiency over naked plasmid DNA. Recently, Kim et al. [372] have proposed the 

use of poly(amino ester) obtained by bulk condensation of two monomers-containing multiple reacting 

groups towards obtaining a non-viral and cationic polymer-based gene delivery system. The particular 

feature of this system consisted on the low cytotoxicity and slow degradation which possibly long-term 

therapeutic applications.  

There are many factors affecting the efficiency of non-viral gene delivery systems. For successful gene 

therapy first of all, we need that genetic material can be permanently integrated and expressed by cells. 

In this context, Galetti et al. [373] have demonstrated that antisense oligonucleotides (ONs, gene-specific 

sequences of nucleic acids with 15 to 25 bases) directed to LMP1 mRNA, effectively suppressed LMP1 

gene expression which plays a key role for growth transformation and immortalization of B lymphocytes. 



CHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review

The efficiency of three cationic carriers on the delivery of anti-LMP1-ON to their site of action in Epstein 

Barr virus (EBV)-infected B lymphocytes was investigated. Results have shown that liposomes, 

dendrimers or transferrin-PLL-conjugated ON were internalized by the cells at an extent several fold 

higher than that of the naked oligomers. Using Superfect®, a dendrimeric polycation with terminal amine 

groups, a higher intracellular concentration of ON was obtained as observed by both cytofluorimetric 

and confocal microscopy analysis. However, there were some evidences of toxicity induced by the 

positively charged dendrimers on the lymphocytes’ membranes and the lack of intracellular mRNA-ON 

duplex formation and of LMP1 mRNA degradation, indicated a failure of this carrier.  

To improve transfection efficiency, different strategies have been proposed. In this respect, Arima and 

coworkers [374] prepared a novel conjugate consisting of a dendrimer (G3) with ?-cyclodextrin bearing 

mannose (Man-?-CDE conjugates) with various degrees of substitution of the mannose moiety. This 

system Man-?-CDE conjugate (G3, DSM10) provided the highest gene transfer activity in different cells 

type and provided new insights on the cellular association of polyplex with Man-?-CDE conjugate (G3, 

DSM10). Results also suggested that the conjugate has less cytotoxicity and were able to escape from 

endosome and to be translocated into the nucleus.  

Luo et al. study [375] revelead the low cytotoxicity of PEG-modified PAMAM and their efficiency on the 

DNA delivery. These systems were obtained using low generation dendrimers with PEG chains, which 

mimics the fractured high-generation dendrimers. In fact, the proposed molecules showed a 20-fold 

increase in transfection efficiency as compared to that of partially degraded dendrimer controls. 

Zhang and coworkers [376] have investigated the effect of the core structure and generation of PAMAM 

dendrimers on the formation and transfection efficiency of the dendriplexes. This work evaluated in vitro, 

the transfection efficiency of a series of dendrimers with a trimesyl core (DT, three-arm) using COS-7 

cells, HeLa cells and primary hepatocytes. Dendrimers derived from pentaerythritol (DP, four-arm) and 

inositol (DI, six-arm) were used for comparison. Results revealed that the minimal generation of DT for 

complex with DNA was 6, while for DP and DI was 5. Thus, the difference in core structure resulted in 

different dendrimer flexibilities, and consequently influenced the interaction between the dendrimers and 

the DNA. As expected, the optimal generation numbers at which dendrimers showed higher transgene 

expression was 5 for DPs and DIs and 6 for DTs. Importantly, DT dendriplexes show higher transfection 

efficiency, which can be related to its buffer capacity inside the endosome.  

Boussif work [377] use PEI to test its potential for gene delivery. PEI is a protonable amino nitrogen atom, 

which makes the polymeric network an effective ‘‘proton sponge’’ at virtually any pH and can protect

DNA from nuclease activity. The PEI/luciferase reporter gene complex was transfered into a variety of 

cell lines and primary cells gave results comparable to that of lipopolyamines (gold standard).  

Interestingly, Dung et al. [378] have prepared deriplexes of cholesteryl dendrimers with antisense 

oligonucleotides (5:1). These were biologically active and mediated delivery of antisense oligonucleotide 

into HeLa cells in a moderate level. The enhanced delivery of the antisense oligomer into nucleus of the 

cells resulted in the expression of the reporter gene product, a luciferase. Thus, that work demonstrated 

that the increase of hydrophobicity by the conjugation of cholesterol to dendrimer enhanced the delivery 

efficiency of antisense oligonucleotide into cells.  

Recently, Russ et al. [379] have synthesize grafted-PPI dendrimers of PPI dendrimers (G2 and G3) by 

surface modification with either oligoethylenimine (OEI) via ester-degradable or PPI dendrimer (G2). In 

that study, it was investigated their potential as vectors for gene delivery both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro 

transfection studies with the polyplexes (surface-modified PPI dendrimers and plasmid DNA pCMVLuc-

firefly luciferase reporter gene) was carried out using both Neuro2A neuroblastoma cells (ATCC®, CCl-

131) and B16F10 murine melanoma cells. Results have shown that all compounds were not cytotoxic 

and grafting of either G2 or G3 core units with OEI led to enhanced transfection efficiency, irrespective 

of the investigated core generation used. Increase of dendrimers' generation did not enhance 

transfection efficiency in vitro. Prior in vivo studies, it was screened possible haemolytic activity of the 

compounds. Contrarily to the previously reported PEI-induced erythrocyte aggregation, this work 

showed that all developed vectors did not induce erythrocyte aggregation. In vivo, it was observe a clear 

influence of the dendrimers in the the tumor gene expression levels, i.e. higher dendrimer core 

generation increased gene expression, demonstrating that surface modification and incorporation of 

ethylenimine core are key factors contributing to improve biocompatibility and transfection efficiency. 

Tziveleka et al. [380,381] have been proposing different synthetic vectors for the prospective application as 

gene transfection agents. Interestingly, fourth generation PPI dendrimers partially or fully surface-

modified with guanidinium groups were able to complex with plasmid DNA (pEGFP-C2 and pGL3 

luciferase reporter vectors). In vitro studies using human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) and the monkey 

kidney fibroblast (COS-7) cells, showed that complete replacement of primary amino groups with the 

hydroxylated moieties resulted in complete loss of transfection efficiency. Contrarily, functionalization of 

the dendrimers with guanidinium groups enhanced transfection efficiency. This enhancement was 

dependent on the number of guanidinium groups at dendrimer periphery and cell type. In fact, the fully 

guanidinylated-modified dendrimer showed the best transfection efficiency. The advanced explanation is 

related with the accumulation of the guanidinium group at the dendrimeric surface, which can improve 



CHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review 
 

 
 
- 50 - 
 

their penetrating ability. However, cytotoxicity studies demonstrated that increase in the degree of 

guanidinylation increase dendrimer's cytotoxicity. Thus, at light of these data, we can once state that 

functionalization strategies can be valuable strategy for superior transfection efficiency, but special 

attention should be addressed in respect to cytotoxicity, which as in the present work can limit gene 

transfer potency. 

Choi [382] adopted a different strategy to improve transfection efficiency of PAMAM dendrimers. In his 

work, it was demonstrated the positive effect on the transfection efficiency of polyplexes by bonding Dex 

to PAMAM dendrimers. In vitro studies using human embryonic kidney (293) and mouse neuroblastoma 

(Neuro2A) cells, showed that PAMAM-Dex/plasmid DNA (pCMV-Luc) complex had a higher transfection 

efficiency as compared to PEI and PAMAM, in the presence of serum proteins. Using 1,2-bis-(o-

aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N',N',-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM), a glucocorticoid 

receptor inhibitor, they have proved that Dex-induced translocation of the glucocorticoid receptor 

facilitate transport of complexes into nucleus, thus enhancing by this mean transfection efficiency. 

Great efforts have also been made as an attempt to clarify the mechanism (s) of transfection. Manunta 

et al. [383] have reported on the route by which dendriplexes are internalised, and mediate gene transfer. 

This work demonstrated that internalization is dependent on the cell type, and it is a successful example 

of dendrimer application as a non-viral vector for gene delivery. This report showed that transfection of 

the dendriplexes may occur via different pathways, but in cells expressing caveolae, results suggest that 

gene delivery might be occurring by a caveolin-dependent pathway. Ruponen et al. [384] carried out a 

comparative study to investigate the performance of both cationic lipids (e.g. N-(1-(2,3-dio-leoyloxy) 

propyl)-N,N,N-trimethyl ammonium methylsulfate (DOTAP) and 1,2-dioleyl-3-phosphatidylethanolamine 

(DOPE)) and polymers (e.g. PEI, PAMAM dendrimers and PLL) for gene delivery. Moreover, the effect 

of interactions of extracellular polyanionic glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) such as hyaluronic acid (HA), 

chondroitin sulfate, and heparan sulfate with positively charged plasmid DNA complexes on the 

transfection efficiency was investigated. Results have shown that polycations condensed DNA more 

effectively as compared to that of monovalent lipids. Furthermore, polyplexes (PEI, PLL) were 

internalized by the cells more efficiently than lipoplexes. It was also found that sulfated GAGs (heparan 

sulfate, chondroitin sulfates B and C) completely blocked transfection, except in the case of liposomes 

with DOPE. Moreover, it was evidenced that sulfated GAGs induced DNA release from PEI complexes, 

but DNA release from the complexes was not required for the inhibition of transfection. By its turn, HA 

also inhibited transfection by PEI, PAMAM dendrimers. This comphreensive study suggested that cell 

surface GAGs, namely heparan sulfate can inhibit transfection mediated by both cationic lipids and

polymers indicating that mechanistic information can help to develop more efficient vectors for gene 

delivery.  

On the other hand, the protection of DNA from in vivo degradation by the vectors is another key feature 

for success in gene delivery. Recently, new step forward report by Diaz-Mochon [385] showed that a 

hybrid combination of PAMAM and peptide dendrimers, the so-called peptoid dendrimers were able to 

transfect cells with higher efficiency than the PAMAM counterpart and were also non-toxic. In part, this 

work supported previous findings which demonstrated that combination of primary and secondary 

amines generates a ‘‘proton sponge’’ effect which can facilitate the DNA transfection process, by 

facilitating the release of the plasmid from the cytoplasmic lysosome. Thus, efficiency of dendrimer/DNA 

complexes may be favoured by prolonging the release of plasmid. 

An early stage work reported by Herrmann [386] described the synthesis of polyphenylene dendrimers 

functionalized with lysine residues or substituted with short peptide sequences composed of five lysine 

or glutamic acid repeats and a C- or N-terminal cysteine residue. This group postulated that these 

amino acid and peptide functionalized dendrimers may be of interest as model compounds to study 

DNA complexation. 

There are few papers which employ dendritic PLL as a gene delivery carrier, either alone or in 

combination with linear polymers or PEG. However, Männistö et al. [387] have been shown that the shape 

and charge of these non-viral vectors greatly influences their complexation with DNA and ultimately their 

transfection efficiency. Their study showed the ability of PLL dendrimers for complexing with DNA. 

Linear polymers were more efficient than dendritic ones. At low Mw of PLL, DNA binding and 

condensation were less efficient, particularly with dendrimers. PEGylation did not decrease DNA 

condensation of PLLs at less than 60% (fraction of Mw) of PEG. Moreover, introduction of PEG 

stabilized the complexes sterically. Internalization of PLL/DNA complexes was high and PEGylation 

increased the transfection efficacy. However, overall transfection level of PLL was low possibly due to 

inadequate escape of the complexes from endosomes or poor release of DNA from the complexes. 

Higashi et al. [388] have been studying the interaction of water soluble PLL-shelled dendrimers 

possessing various PLL segment (n = 5-40) with DNA by circular dichroism spectroscopy, dynamic light 

scattering, and melting behavior of double-stranded DNA. Double helical DNAs were found to complex 

with dendritic PLLs (G3) [5, 10, and 20] primarily via electrostatic interactions. Moreover, a longer PLL-

containing (G3) was found to interact with DNA more effectively than a shorter one. Okuda et al. [389] 

have also investigated the effect of substituting terminal cationic groups in PLL on the gene delivery into 

cells, in particular, the effect of guanidinium groups on the transfection. Monodispersed PLL (G6)

dendrimers in which external amino acids were replaced by arginines and histidines were synthesized. 

A particular attention was given to clarify whether histidine shows the activity as an endosomal 

disruption agent. DNA-binding and transfection studies revealed that arginine-terminated PLL 

dendrimers could bind to the DNA more efficiently, and presented higher transfection efficiency as 

compared to those for histidine-terminated PLL. In fact, histidine-terminated PLL did not mediate 

transfection. Despite, the terminal histidines of PLL dendriemrs, especially the imidazole groups, had a 

key role in the pH-dependent complex formation and transfection (neutral and acidic pH´s). The unique 

character of histidine-PLL dendrimers is most promising. 

As aforementioned, cationic PAMAM dendrimers have been proving to efficiently mediate transfection of 

DNA into a variety of mammalian cells, in vitro. However, as highlighted the major drawback of high 

generation cationic dendrimers is their associated cytotoxicity.  Anionic dendrimers, on the other hand, 

have shown no cytotoxic effect on cells over a broad range of concentrations. Hussain et al. [390] have 

reported the successful use of ONs conjugated with pentaerythritol-based anionic dendrimers in 

inhibiting cancer cell growth. In vitro studies using cancer cells showed that ONs-dendrimer conjugates 

enhance the cellular uptake, up to 4 times as compared to that for naked ONs. These data clearly 

demonstrated that anionic ONs-dendrimer conjugates may represent attractive alternatives to cationic 

non-viral vectors for the delivery of gene silencing ONs. However whether the system may facilitate the 

delivery of duplex siRNA for gene silencing by RNA interference need to be answer. Therefore, further 

studies are necessary to evaluate the full potential of the delivery system.  

Electrophoretic studies carried out by Kuo et al. [391] have demonstrated that fifth generation PAMAM 

and PPI dendrimers altered or blocked the mobility of RNA isolated from human macrophage-like cells 

(U937 cell line) and mouse fibroblast NIH/3T3cells previously exposed to DNA/dendrimer complexes. At 

higher dendrimer:DNA ratio, dendrimers interacted with RNA after isolation, but gene expression of 

these complexes was not affected. Electrostatic forces were found to be responsible for the dendrimer-

induced alteration in RNA mobility. Because RNA isolation is routinely used for biological applications, 

such dendrimer-induced alteration in RNA mobility should be accounted for when further processing 

RNA for related applications, and the use of high ionic strength solvents (2 M NaCl solution) to disrupt 

the electrostatic forces binding dendrimers to RNA is advised. 

A final key aspect in the gene delivery is related to the need for controlling gene transfection. This can 

be accomplished by developing controllable and nontoxic gene delivery systems that are stimuli-

responsive. For example, Nishiyama et al. [392] proposed an innovative strategy based on PCI gene 

delivery. In their work, they have developed a ternary complexes (size between 100 and composed of a

core of and cationic peptides (C(YGRKKRRQRRRG)2) that were enveloped in the second generation 

aryl ether dendrimers (32 carboxyl groups at the periphery) with a phtalocyanine core (photosensitizer). 

In vitro transfection studies using human cervical epithelioid carcinoma (HeLa) cells demonstrated that 

this ternary system enhance (&gt;100-fold) transgene expression as compared to conventional reagents 

such as PEI and Lipofectamine, in vitro. Moreover, it was shown that PCI-mediated gene delivery 

reduced phototoxicity of the ternary complexes. For the in vivo studies a reported gene was used. 

Fluorescence microscopy studies of rat conjunctival tissue revealed that the ternary complex positively 

induced gene delivery by PCI. That work demonstrated that polyplex-polycations significantly affects 

both transfection efficiency and toxicity. Therefore further optimization of this type of systems should 

involve research on the use of other polycations. Thus, PCI provides us with an opportunity to develop 

efficient light-inducible gene delivery systems.  Shieh et al. [393] also investigated phototriggered gene 

transfection by core-modified PAMAM dendrimers (G4). In their work, a 5,10,15-tri(4-acetamidophenyl)-

20-mono(4-carboxylphenyl) porphyrin (hydrophobic core) was introduced into the PAMAM dendrimers 

by activation with DCC and N-hydroxysuccinimide. In vitro characterization studies revealed that 

porphyrin core-PAMAM dendrimer conjugates were able to complex with green fluorescent protein 

(EGFP) plasmid DNA and that the internalization by HeLa cells was concentration-dependent. 

Moreover, results from phototoxicity showed that without irradiation more than 94% of the cells survived 

when incubated with conjugates at a concentration of 20 ?M. However, the complexes induced toxicity 

at 50 ?M. For photodynamic therapy, results show that conjugation of porphyrin core to dendrimers did 

not increase the cytotoxicity of the PAMAM dendrimer below 20 ?M, but significantly induced cell death 

after suitable irradiation. Despite, the expression of EGFP was enhanced in HeLa cells using the PCI 

treatment. Thus, that study demonstrated that PAMAM dendrimers conjugated with porphyrin core can 

be an efficient and safe vector for PCI-mediated gene delivery. 

Dendrimers are one of the most useful nonviral gene delivery systems. Their ability to transfect cells 

without inducing toxicity and be tuned for stimuli-induced gene delivery confers a great advantage over 

other gene delivery vectors for use in vivo. 

3.5. THERANOSTICS APPLICATIONS OF DENDRIMERS AND DENDRONIZED POLYMERS  

Although opportunities to develop nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems extend into all 

therapeutic classes of pharmaceuticals, the development of effective diagnose and therapeutic, i.e. one-

package systems that can target different tissues while releasing one or multiple therapeutic agents 

under a external stimuli have been attracting a great deal of attention. For example, in cancer therapy,

anticancer agents can damage both malignant and normal cells alike. Additional problems include 

instability of the drugs/GFs in the biological milieu and short half-time, systemic migration, and 

premature drug loss through either rapid clearance by Mo/Mac, and/or metabolism. The design of most 

sophisticated systems should also consider the need for temporal release of the drug (s). Thus, 

dendrimers can be tuned for: (i) be stimuli-responsive nanocarriers, (ii) include molecular tags, (iii) 

possess high payload efficiency, (iv) decrease dosage requirements as well as re-dosage frequency 

and (v) target delivery and minimize drug migration, thus suppressing secondary effects during drug (s) 

treatment. For example, Kuo and colleagues [394] have investigated in vivo, the interactions of second 

and third generation PPI dendrimers with human macrophages U-937, since these molecules are 

primarily removed from circulation by the mononuclear phagocyte system. The effect of the type of 

dendrimer and concentration on the content of ntracellular responses-reactive oxygen species (ROS), 

mitochondria membrane potential, cell size and complexity, and cell cycle profiles were investigated. 

Although the concentrations of PPI dendrimers used (40-300 ?g.mL-1) were not cytotoxic, various 

intracellular responses in dendrimer-treated macrophages occurred in a time-dependent manner. 

Moreover, the intracellular responses were found to be dependent on the dendrimer generation. This 

work nicely illustrates that a better understanding of the molecular action of these nanosystems in the 

cellular system may be an advantage for best design of safer and more effective delivery systems. 

As previously stated herein, dendrimers fulfill these requirements as they can be stimuli-responsive and 

controlled-release systems for nucleic acids, bioactive molecules and peptide/protein delivery. Due to 

the possibility of tailoring the end groups, dendrimers are able to interact with the target, such as cell 

walls and/or proteins [159]. The external functional groups may allow the simultaneous, covalent bonding 

to therapeutic drugs, targeting devices and fluorescent probes (Figure 9).  

Recently, a combination of polymer chemistry and imaging science approaches has led to the 

generation of polymer-based bioimaging probes for the diagnosis and treatment of different diseases. 

The ultimate goal of in vivo imaging is to achieve highly sensitive and reliable imaging techniques viable 

for diagnosis in personalized medicine for delivering drugs, following their distribution, and monitoring 

therapy. This concept (theranostics) is based on the “find, fight and follow” approach. New probes with 

enhanced capabilities and performance should be developed specific to nano-imaging techniques. Key 

research priorities for targeted delivery and in vivo imaging should address: (i) design of nanostructures 

with stealth properties that prevent them from being opsonised or cleared before reaching the target 

cells, (ii) ability to penetrate into cells and crossover biological barriers like the BBB, uptake and 

recycling of nanostructures, (iii) nanocarriers or strategies that selectively targets diseased cells, tissues

and organs, (iv)  trans-endocytosis of nanostructures, (v) safety evaluation (in vitro/in vivo cytotoxicity, 

haemo-compatibility and immunogenicity), in vivo carrier biodistribution, and (vi) compatibility with 

external activation by magnetic field, ultrasound, X-ray, or optics to trigger the therapeutic activity. For 

example, the Kobayashi and coworkers [395] have shown that a dendrimer-based magnetic resonance 

contrast agent may be useful for in vivo detection of renal tubular damage. By its turn, Rietveld et al. [396] 

developed dendrimers with tetrabenzoporphyrin cores for in vivo oxygen imaging. While it is promising 

to both incorporate therapeutic agents and molecular-tags on the dendrimers and improve their potency 

[73], the possibility of combining diagnosis and therapy in multi-functional dendrimer-based nanosystems 

can allow the early detection, targeting and treatment of several diseases.

Figure 9. Schematic representation of dendrimers with the external binding of the drug and fluorescent 

probes for applications in theranostics (one package system). It is possible follow the biodistribution, 

internalization and intracellular trafficking within cells. The use of targeting devices such as antibodies to 

augment specificity is also possible. The drug can linked to dendrimers using different spacers or bonds 

(X), which can be cleaved under a certain external stimuli, thus stimuli- or bio-responsive release is an 

additional possibility. 

Thomas et al. [397] have linked PAMAM dendrimers (G5) with FITC for tracking, and two different 

antibodies  60bca and J591 antibodies that bind to CD14 and prostrate specific membrane antigen 

(PSMA), respectively. This work showed the receptor specificity as the conjugates bound to specific 

antigen expressing cells. By its turn, Shukla and coworkers [398] have synthesized PAMAM dendrimers 

(G5) conjugated to anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody by tagging the formulation with alexaFluor (AF). 

Flow cytometric studies revealed the uptake of conjugate by HER2 expressing cells while no such 

affinity was found for MCA-207 control cells that did not express HER2, in vitro.

According to the literature, the success of entrapping small molecules inside the dendrimer depends on 

the mutual properties between the host and the guest molecules. For example, Domanski et al. [83] 

reported on the attempts to entrap of  small fluorescent probes commonly used to evaluate membrane 

fluidity inside the dendrimer. This work has shown that the 12-(9-anthroyloxy) stearic acid (12-AS), a 

non-polar fatty acid derivative, was successfully incorporated into the PAMAM dendrimers cavities, 

while on the contrary 1-(trimethylammoniumphenyl)-6-phenyl-1,3,5 hexatriene p-toluenesulfonate (TMA-

DPH), a amphiphilic salt possessing positive charge, was not.  

Kolhe et al. [399] have demonstrated that ibuprofen predominantly forms a complex with PAMAM (G3 and 

G4) dendrimers because of the ionic interaction between the -NH2 end groups and the carboxyl group of 

ibuprofen. In this work, they demonstrated that the in vitro release of ibuprofen from drug-dendrimer 

complex is appreciably slower compared to pure ibuprofen. Moreover, the FITC-labeled dendrimer-

complexed drug enters human lung epithelial carcinoma A549 cells much faster than pure drug 

suggesting that dendrimers may be able to carry the complexed drug inside cells efficiently. That group 

[56] synthesized a fourth generation PAMAM (PAMAM-OH) dendrimer covalently linked to ibuprofen 

using dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) as a coupling agent.  A high payload nanocarrier was obtained; 

58 molecules of ibuprofen were covalently conjugated to one molecule of PAMAM-OH (G4) dendrimer. 

FITC-labeled dendrimer-drug conjugate nanoparticles internalization was evaluated in vitro once using 

A549 cells. The pharmacological activity of the dendrimer-ibuprofen conjugate was compared to pure 

ibuprofen at various time points by measuring the suppression of prostaglandin E2. Results 

demonstrated the high internalization efficency of the FITC-labeled dendrimer-drug conjugate and 

superior therapeutic activity due to faster prostaglandin E2 suppression. Thus, the results suggest that 

dendrimer-ibuprofen conjugate improve the drug efficacy by enhanced cellular delivery, and may 

produce a rapid pharmacological response. For example, several ligands are known to be associated 

with tumour. Ligand based dendritic polymers have been attracting great deal of attention for find 

applications in cancer-cell-specific targeting [102] and tumour therapy [400].  

Transferrin is a ?-globulin (?1-glycoprotein) and facilitates the transport of ferric ion (Fe3+) through 

transferrin receptors on the plasma membrane. In fact use of transferrin as a ligand has been explored 

as a suitable delivery system for site-specific delivery to tumours [401]. PLL covalently linked with 

transferrin for delivery of ONs when exposed to human leukemic (HL-60) cells have been stated to 

promote apoptosis to a greater extent as compared to free ONs. Another paper [402] demonstrated that 

PEGylated poly(cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles conjugated to transferrin were effective on the delivery of 

paclitaxel (PTX), an antitumour drug. PEGylation prevented aggregation of nanoparticles and transferrin

effectively determined tumour site. An excellent study by Choi and coworkers [102] is appropriate to 

highlight herein. Their innovative wotk consisted on the development of dendrimers conjugated to 

different biofunctional moieties [FITC for imaging, and folic acid (FA) for targeting], and then were link 

together using complementary DNA oligonucleotides to produce clustered molecules for targeting 

tumour cells through folate receptors. This step forward allowed both obtain efficient DNA-linked 

dendrimer clusters for intracellular imaging and therapeutics, and circumvent the tedious synthesis of 

multiply-functionalized dendrimers.  

Instead of linking oligonucleotides to the dendrimers, Majoros [403] synthesized a multifunctional PAMAM 

dendrimer (G5) conjugated with FITC, FA, and PTX. In vitro studies have shown that drug-free 

dendrimer conjugates were not cytotoxic even at high concentrations. On contrary, drug-loaded 

dendrimer conjugates were toxic to both folate receptor-positive and folate receptor-negative cells as a 

result of non-specific binding at concentrations around 200 nM. 

Another good example of PAMAM dendrimer based multifunctional devices (target the desire cells, 

releasing the desired drug and monitoring their internalization-fluorescent probe) has been reported by 

Islam et al. [404]. This group partially acetylated PAMAM dendrimers (G5) that were then conjugated with 

FITC, FA and MTX. These intended for targeting tumour cells through the folate receptor, while 

releasing intracellularly an antitumour drug. Interestingly, they have shown that HPLC analysis is a 

valuable technique to determine the purity and stability of dendrimer-based complexes. Yang et al. [405] 

have synthesized FITC- and biotin-linked PAMAM dendrimer (G5) conjugates and investigated their 

ability for targeting cancer cells. The bifunctional conjugate (FITC-biotin-dendrimer) exhibited much 

higher internalization by HeLa cells than the conjugate without biotin. The uptake was found to be 

energy and dose-dependent, and could be effectively blocked by dendrimer-conjugated biotin. Results 

indicate that the biocompatible biotin-dendrimer conjugate can be a promising nano-platform for therapy 

and diagnosis of tumours. 

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is an important factor that controls the disposition of neoplastic cells and 

potentiates transcription and proliferation of cells. Human growth receptor (HER-2) is a member of EGF 

family and their number is augmented in several tumours [406], and hence, it provides a potential target 

for immunotherapeutic agent. 

Nanoparticles having size range of 1-10 nm have capacity to diffuse easily inside the tumour cells. This 

helps to overcome limitations relating to chemotherapy using free drug such as poor in vivo/in vitro 

correlation and overcome other possible resistances offered by tumours. In fact, Tomalia [407] has also 

been proposing the use of ~5 nm sodium salt-PAMAM dendrimers (G4.5) nanoparticles possessing a

1,4-diaminobutanecore, as multi-purpose nanodevices for oncology drug delivery and diagnostic MRI 

contrast agents.  

Relevant scientific data was recently reported by Saad et al. [408]. In this interesting work they 

investigated on the role of different nanocarriers (linear polymer, PAMAM dendrimer and liposomes) 

containing the same bioactive agents, in tumour-specific treatment and imaging. Which nanocarrier is 

most efficient was investigated. In their comphreensive work it was demonstrated for the first time, that 

the targeting of nanocarriers to tumor-specific receptors minimize the influence of the architecture, 

composition, size and Mw of nanocarriers on the efficacy of imaging and cancer treatment. This step 

forward, once illustrate that the nanocarriers potential can only be fully exploited with a much better 

understanding of how such structures interact with the body and its components, in vitro and in vivo.  

4. CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE OUTLOOK 

Nanotechnology and medicine research are merging with other fields leading to completely new science 

and superior technological platforms such as those recently reported for regenerative medicine and 

neurosciences. The main aim of this review article was to summarize the unique properties, ability to 

design and improve the biological performance of dendrimers. This novel class of polymers and their 

derivatives has been exhibiting unique physicochemical and biological properties which have great 

potential to be used in a variety of applications, including tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, 

which have been discussed herein. 

It was also emphasized their compatibility with nanoscale building blocks such as genetic material, 

bioactive molecules and fluorescent-probes, which make them even more versatile than other 

nanomaterials, indeed probably unique feature to be used in theranostics. Dendrimers arises in a time 

when common medical practice is based on symptom control, and research is focused on the best 

drugs to relieve the impact and progression of a given disease. Dendrimers may be used as tools to 

diagnose pathologies in an early stage thus helping manage disease in a sustainable manner. There is 

however, the need to conduct comprehensive research in vivo, to better understand and assess their 

true value as multifunctional packages. In particular, we still do not know whether these synthetic 

polymers, once they entered the body can cause damage to other tissues. Thus, much effort needs to 

be done in future, to evaluate the risk of bioaccumulation and redistribution. Research on their 

adsorption and interaction with biological surfaces, the associated uptake mechanisms, long-term 

effects, and bioelimination needs also to be determined. Hence new and unexplored characteristics of 

nanoscale are opened, and unsettled issues of biocompatibility, which will remain a key challenge

without a definitive near term answer, progress in the field of dendritic polymers will certainly depend on 

other not less important aspects. In order to be effective, dendrimer-based products should be based on 

scientific evidence for their uselfulness and must be easier to translate from laboratory to the clinic, in 

other words be quality-controlable, cost-effective and sustainable. At last but not least, their application 

should be validated from the regulator’s viewpoint, worldwide.  

As a final remark, the process of converting basic discoveries into marketable products can be long and 

hard but certainty arise, since the discovery of dendrimers we can envision things never possible before 

and expect many innovations in the puzzled field of regenerative medicine.

CHAPTER II.  

Materials and methods 

The main aim of this chapter is to describe in detail, the experimental work and protocols related to the 

obtained results that will be provided further, in Section 3. Along with Chapter I, it aims to be a guideline 

of the rationale for this research, namely on the aspects related with the selection of the materials, on 

the processing routes used, and characterization process adopted. 

1. MATERIALS 

1.1. CHITOSAN (CHT) 

Chitin is a homopolymer of ?(1?4)-linked N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues (Figure 1A). Chitin is a 

natural polysaccharide and is the principal structural component of the exoskeleton of invertebrates 

such as crustaceans, insects and spiders and it can also be found in the cell walls of most fungi and 

many algae.  

Chitosan (CHT) that is positively charged (interact easily with cell surface and negatively charged 

macromolecules), is an N-deacetylated derivative of chitin mainly composed of 2-amino-2-deoxy-D-

glucopyranose units (Figure 1B) [1]. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 1. Schematic illustration of the structure of chitin (A), and chitosan (B). 

It has also been reported  that chitosan is biodegradable and non-toxic [2,3]. Important parameters 

affecting the characteristics of chitosan are its molecular weight (Mw) and its degree of deacetylation 

(DD), representing the proportion of deacetylated units [4]. It is a semi-crystalline polymer and the 

degree of crystallinity, depends on the degree of deacetylation, i.e. crystallinity is maximum for both 

chitin (0% deacetylated) and fully deacetylated (100%) chitosan. By its turn, minimum crystallinity is

achieved at intermediate degrees of deacetylation. Chitosan is insoluble in aqueous solutions above pH 

7, but in dilute acids, the free amino groups are protonated and the molecule becomes fully soluble 

below ~pH 5. The pH-dependent solubility of chitosan provides a convenient mechanism for processing 

under mild conditions. For example, viscous solutions can be extruded and gelled in high pH solutions 

[5]. Freeze-drying techniques also allows obtaining highly porous structures by means of freezing a 

polymer solution (-20ºC and -196ºC) [6-9], following with the removal of solvent through lyophilization. 

Thus, chitosan scaffolds production is also conceivable. If we consider its biological properties such as 

biocompatibility and immunological, antibacterial and wound-healing activity [2, 10-12] and processability, 

chitosan is one of the most appealing biomaterials for prospective applications in tissue engineering. 

Moreover, given the importance of glucosaminoglycans (GAGs) in stimulating the chondrogenesis [13], 

the use of GAGs or GAG analogs as components of a cartilage tissue engineered scaffold is desired for 

improving chondrogenesis. One such candidate is chitosan, which shares structural characteristics with 

various GAGs and hyaluronic acid (HA) present in articular cartilage [1].  

For the research work within this thesis, CHT was chosen for the being used in the production of 

bilayered scaffolds (cartilage layer) due to the highlighted advantages. Reagent grade CHT particles 

with a deacetylation degree of ~91% and size in the range of 125-250 ?m were purchased from Vanson 

(USA). Since chitosan is a commercial product, it can contain impurities. Their elimination was 

performed using a re-precipitation method as described by Signini and coworkers [14]. 

1.2. CARBOXYMETHYLCHITOSAN (CMCHT) 

Chitin and CHT are attractive macromolecules, but their use is limited due to its poor water-solubility. 

Chemical modifications in chitosan molecular structure are viable due to the existence of reactive 

functional groups (e.g. amine -NH2 and hydroxyl -OH), allowing to tailor its degradation profile and widen 

its applications [15]. Thus, to develop biomaterials with improved physicochemical properties, attempts 

have been made to modify its structure by introducing acetyl [16], carboxymethyl [17], sulfuryl, or 

phosphoryl groups [18], among others.  

Carboxymethylchitosan (CMCht) is a water-soluble biomacromolecule derived from deacetylation and 

insertion of carboxylic functions in chitosan (Figure 2) [19]. CMCht is soluble in a wide range of pH and its 

properties, namely low toxicity and antimicrobial activity [12], may wider its application, including medical 

and pharmaceutical areas - mainly for the controlled release of drugs.

Figure 2. Schematic illustration of the structure of CMCht. 

The choice of the appropriate reaction conditions and reagents allows the preparation of N-, O-, N,O- or 

N,N-dicarboxymethylchitosan [20]. Thus, the properties and applications of carboxymethylchitosan are 

strongly dependent on its structural characteristics, mainly the degree of substitution (DS) and the locus, 

amino or hydroxyl group.  

For the purpose of this thesis, reagent grade chitosan particles with a DD of ~91%, monochloroacetic 

acid, 1% acetic acid solution, 40% sodium hydroxide solution, and acetone were used in the preparation 

of carboxymethylchitosan (CMCht). Sucessful preparation of CMCht was achieved using a reaction 

vessel apparatus as represented in Figure 3. The methodology used has been previously reported by 

Chen et al. [21]. Succintly, chitosan (5 g), 40% sodium hydroxide solution and solvent (100 mL) were 

added into a flask (500 mL) to swell and alkalize at room temperature for 1 hour. Then the 

monochloroacetic acid (18 g) was added into the reaction vessel dropwise for 30 minutes and reacted 

for 2 hours. During that time the temperature was maintained in a water bath at 60ºC. The reaction was 

stopped by adding 70% ethanol (200 mL). The solid was filtered and rinsed in 70-90% ethanol to de-salt 

and de-water, and vacuum dried at room temperature. Finally, the H-form of CMCht was obtained by 

suspending the Na salt CMCht in 80% ethanol aqueous solution (100 mL) and 37% hydrochloric acid 

(10 mL) for 30 minutes, under agitation. The solid was filtered and rinsed in 70-90% ethanol to neutral, 

freezed at -80ºC and freeze-dried (Telstar-Cryodos -80, Spain). CMCht with a DD of 80% and DS of 

47% was chosen for the being used in the production of composite scaffolds and to surface modify the 

dendrimers, due to the previously highlighted advantages.

For the composites scaffolds production, the incorporation of the bioactive ceramic filler has been 

carried out with two main goals. In one hand, a bioactive ceramic has always the potential capability of 

inducing a bioactive behaviour in a polymeric matrix [13-15]. On the other, being a ceramic filler, it can 

potentially improve the mechanical performance of the polymeric matrix where it is incorporated [13,16,17]. 

1.3. HYDROXYLAPATITE (HAP) 

Hydroxylapatite (HAp) is represented by the chemical formula (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2), and its structure 

resembles to the primary mineral component of bone. For some time now, bone substitute materials 

composed of HAp are available for use in surgery [22]. The reason for this is related with its biological 

characteristics namely its biocompatibility, non-immunogenic [23] and resorbability [24]. Moreover, it 

facilitates osteointegration of implants [25] and exhibits excellent osteoconductive ability [26,27], i.e. 

supports the ingrowth of bony tissue.  

In this thesis, HAp powders were prepared by precipitation in an aqueous system (wet-chemistry) at 

room temperature. In the precipitation reaction, solutions of calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2 and 85% ortho-

phosphoric acid, H3PO4  were mixed for 2 hours. A controlled drop-wise automated apparatus was

developed using a peristaltic pump (Gilson Miniplus 3, France) for adding a diluted solution of ortho-

phosphoric acid to the calcium hydroxide solution, in a reaction vessel. Synthesis conditions were 

adjusted to obtain a stoichiometric HAp, i.e. Ca/P ratio of 1.67. After complete addition of the acid 

solution, the final pH of medium was adjusted to 11 with concentrated ammonium hydroxide, NH4OH. 

Vigorous stirring was continued during HAp precipitation. The supernatant was removed after 24 hours 

of maturation, and the precipitate filtered under vacuum. The resulting filtrate was dried at 60ºC for 24 

hours, and milled in a mortar until obtaining a fine powder for further use.  

1.4. STARCH-BASED BIOMATERIALS 

Starch is a mixture of glucans composed of ?-amylose and amylopectin (Figure 4) and is synthesized by 

plants. ?-amylose is a linear polymer of several thousand glucose residues ?(1?4)-linked. Amylopectin 

consists of ?(1?4)-linked glucose residues but also possess ?(1?6)-branch points.

incorporated in many polymeric systems in order to develop partially or totally biodegradable plastics [29].

Thus, the use of starch materials have attracted great attention in tissue engineering applications, as it 

can allow the designing of scaffolds with an adequate degradation rate, i.e. the degradation of the 

scaffold matching new tissue formation.  

Our group [30-33] has been proposing the use of starch-based materials obtained from a blend of starch 

and polycaprolactone (SPCL) for bone tissue engineering applications. These starch-based materials 

have the advantages of being non-cytotoxicity, biodegradable, present good mechanical properties and 

can be processed by different methodologies.  

1.5. REAGENTS 

Chemicals used for the synthesis and purification of CHT, CMCht, CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles and HAp as well as their processing and characterization, were bought from the following 

companies: (Aldrich, USA), Fluka (Slovakia and Switzerland), Merck (Germany), Panreac (Spain), 

Pronalab (Portugal), Riedel-de Haën (Germany), and Sigma or Sigma-Aldrich (Germany). 

2. SCAFFOLDS PRODUCTION  

2.1. PROCESSING METHODOLOGIES FOR PRODUCTION OF SCAFFOLDS: OVERVIEW 

Much attention has been given to choose the best processing techniques for the development of 

scaffolds of different shape, size and architecture for tissue engineering purposes. The processing 

technique must allow for the preparation of scaffolds with controlled porosity and adequate pore size, as 

well as tissue matching mechanical properties and an appropriate biological response. Among the 

processing methodologies myriad, a wide range have been exploited by our group. These are based on 

conventional melt-based processing routes, such as extrusion using blowing agents, and other based 

on multi-step processes such as compression moulding followed by particulate leaching [34]. Others 

include solvent casting and particle leaching, fibre bonding or more recently 3-D plotting [33,35]. Freeze-

drying technique has also been widely used for the production of porous structures with different 

densities, shapes, porosities and pore sizes distributions by simply varying parameters such as polymer 

concentration [36-39], type of solvent [40], freezing temperature [6,9,40-42], type of moulds [8,43] and 

incorporating porogens [9,36,37]. In practice, the polymer solutions should be previously transferred into a 

mould and frozen before freeze-drying at temperatures which are typically comprised between -20ºC to 

-80ºC [6]. Thus, during freeze-drying the space occupied by the frozen solvent will became empty after 

sublimation and by this mean originating the pores [44]. It is important to guarantee that the final freezing 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods  

 
 

- 99 - 
 

temperature is adequate to maintain all the molecules of solvent in the solid state [45]. Otherwise, the 

final structure will shrink during the drying process resulting on the formation of a dense external skin-

like layer. By means of using the described methodologies, it is possible to tailor the properties of the 

different scaffolds, namely their degradation, architecture and mechanical properties, for several 

applications in tissue engineering. 

In this thesis, the scaffolds were produced for applications in bone, cartilage and osteochondral tissue 

engineering by four distinct processing routes: (i) co-precipitation route and wax sphere leaching, (ii) 

sponge burn-out and sintering, (iii) two-step route, i.e. sponge burn-out and sintering, followed by 

impregnation of the polymer solution and freeze-drying, and (iv) by melt spinning followed by fibre 

bonding. 

2.2. CARBOXYMETHYLCHITOSAN/HYDROXYLAPATITE (CMCHT/HAP) COMPOSITE SCAFFOLDS 

The CMCht/HAp composite materials were prepared by a co-precipitation method using a acidic 

‘autocatalytic’ electroless bath [46]. This methodology is based on the possibility of chemisorption of 

Palladium (Pd2+) on the surface of bioinert polymers, which acts as the catalyst to induce the 

precipitation of calcium-phosphate on its surface. A schematic representation of the principle of the 

electroless baths is shown in Chapter III. Thus, CMCht is able to chelate metal ions such as Pd2+. The 

resulting excess of positive charge from the CMht/Pd2+ complex may build up an adjacent layer of 

negative charges (phosphate groups), which can originate a residual charge responsible for attracting 

other calcium ions. Consequently, composite scaffolds may be produced since calcium phosphate 

precipitation can occur in the presence of the CMht/Pd2+ complex.  

For preparation of CMCht/HAp composite scaffolds, CMCht was synthesized as described above 

without further purification steps. Calcium chloride, CaCl2, ortho-phosphoric acid, H3PO4 and palladium 

chloride, PdCl2 were used to prepare the acidic ‘autocatalytic’ electroless bath, and ammonium 

hydroxide 33%, NH4OH solution to adjust the pH of the co-precipitation media. The acidic electroless 

bath was prepared by dissolving calcium chloride with a final concentration of 5.6 g.L-1, ortho-

phosphoric acid 3.4 g.L-1, and palladium chloride 0.9 g.L-1 in 500 mL distilled water, under agitation. A 

10 wt% CMCht aqueous solution was added to the bath using a peristaltic pump (Gilson Miniplus 3, 

France) at a speed rate 2 mL.minute-1. The composite precipitate was obtained by means of adjusting 

the pH of the bath to 6 with ammonium hydroxide. The precipitate was filtered under vacuum and the 

excess of water removed by drying at 37ºC for 24 hours. Porous structures were prepared by means of 

mixing the composite filtrate and 20 wt% wax spheres (Desert Whale Jojoba Company, Inc., USA), with 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods

a diameter ranging from 50-450 ?m, and transferring into a cylindrical mould with 4-7 mm diameter and 

8-22 mm height. After drying at 60ºC, the wax spheres were eliminated off by soaking into 

tetrahydrofuran, in an ultrasound bath, for several hours. Once, the composite scaffolds were allowed to 

dry until constant weight and the scaffolds freeze at -80ºC overnight, followed by freeze-drying for the 

period of 2 days to completely remove the organic solvent. 

2.3. HYDROXYLAPATITE (HAP) SCAFFOLDS 

The HAp scaffolds were produced using a combined strategy consisting of a sponge burn-out followed 

by sintering. The procedure for obtaining the HAp scaffolds is summarized in Figure 5. The HAp 

powders were obtained by wet chemistry as previously described elsewhere. The obtained HAp pellets 

were milled until obtain a fine powder.  

 

Figure 5. Schematic representation of the production route of the HAp scaffolds. 

The HAp slurry was prepared by dispersing HAp powders in methanol for 48 hours. Then, polyurethane 

(PU, Eurospuma SA, Portugal) cylindrical sponges (10 x 8 mm) featuring fully interconnected pores 

were dipped into the slurry until total impregnation (step 1). To prevent the formation of an external skin-

like layer, the impregnated PU sponges were transferred to a centrifuge and the excess of slurry was 

removed by centrifuging at 60 rpm for 1 minute (step 2), followed by drying at 37ºC, for 24 hours (step

3) to avoid the formation of cracks. Finally, the impregnated sponges were placed inside the furnace 

(Fornocerâmica, S.A., Portugal) and the PU matrices burned at 900ºC for 24 hours, followed by 

sintering the HAp scaffolds at 1300ºC for 3 hours (step 4). The HAp scaffolds were allowed to naturally 

cool inside the furnace (step 5). With this technique, the external shape and internal morphology of the 

PU sponge allow to produce HAp scaffolds with controlled internal architecture and external shape. 

2.4. HYDROXYLAPATITE/CHITOSAN BILAYERED (HAP/CHT) SCAFFOLDS 

In this thesis, an innovative technique was proposed for obtaining bilayered structures with improved 

architecture, stability and biological properties for osteochondral tissue engineering applications. 

Hydroxylapatite/chitosan (HAp/CHT) bilayered scaffolds were produced by adopting a two step 

procedure. Firstly, HAp porous layer (bone-like layer) with 10 mm height and 8 mm diameter were 

obtained by the sponge burn-out method as described elsewhere. Secondly, a 3 wt% chitosan solution 

was prepared by dissolving chitosan (CHT) of medium molecular weight and a degree of deacetylation 

of ~85% in 0.2 M acetic acid solution. The bilayered HAp/CHT scaffolds were fabricated by placing the 

HAp scaffolds into cylindrical silicon moulds (20 mm x 8 mm) and transferring the 3 wt% CHT solution. 

To guarantee that the chitosan solution penetrated into the HAp scaffolds it was left resting for 1 minute 

at room temperature. Moulds were freeze at -80°C and lyophilized (Telstar-Cryodos -80, Spain) up to 4 

days to complete remove the frozen solvent, and allow obtaining the ‘cartilage-like layer’ on the top of 

the ‘bone-like layer’. Then, HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds were neutralized using a 0.1 M sodium 

hydroxide solution as previously described [38], freeze at -80°C and then lyophilized.  

2.5. STARCH-POLYCAPROLACTONE (SPCL) SCAFFOLDS 

In previous studies [35,47], our group demonstrated that SPCL fibre meshes are excellent scaffolds for rat 

bone marrow stromal cells, allowing for their proliferation and differentiation into osteoblasts. Thus, in 

the present thesis the starch-based materials were selected to evaluate the combinatorial strategy in 

tissue engineering principles employing carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer 

nanoparticles (see section 3) towards the intracellular release and regimented supply of dexamethasone 

(Dex) aimed at control stem cells osteogenic differentiation and de novo bone formation in the absence 

of typical osteogenic inducers, both in vitro and in vivo (Chapter VIII and IX). 

Starch-polycaprolactone (SPCL) scaffolds were produced by adopting a two step procedure as 

previously reported [30]. The material used was a blend of starch with approximately 70% by weight of 

poly-?-caprolactone (Novamont, Italy). Briefly, fibres of SPCL were produced by melt spinning using a 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods  

 
 
- 102 - 
 

modular co-rotating twin screw extruder in two consecutive steps to a final draw ratio of approximately 

1:100. Then, melt spun fibres were chopped. Fibre bundles were randomly displaced into the custom-

designed mould cavities and subjected to thermal treatment at 60°C for 30 min before compression and 

fibre bonding. SPCL scaffolds (5 mm diameter and 4 mm height) were obtained through cutting of fibre 

bonded meshes with a circular die. Standardized fabrication conditions enabled the production of 

scaffolds with 67.4 ± 1.3% porosity (as determined by micro-computed tomography). More details on 

SPCL scaffolds can be found elsewhere [32,33]. 

2.6. STERILIZATION OF THE SCAFFOLDS 

Prior to the cell culture studies CMCht, PAMAM-CT G 1.5, and CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles 

as well as all scaffolds were sterilized in an ethylene oxide gas atmosphere.  

3. SYNTHESIS OF DENDRONIZED POLYMERS 

Many scientific efforts are directed at improving the characteristics of biomacromolecules for 

applications as host-guest chemistry, nanocarriers, and catalysts, among others. As discussed in 

Chapter I, dendrimers are among such type of macromolecules since it offers a lot of possibilities in the 

molecular design. Such chemical versatility also allows producing multifunctional nanobiomaterials. 

Thus, in this thesis we focused on the development of novel nanoparticle systems with enhanced 

capabilities and performance should be developed specific to drug delivery. Research priorities for 

delivery and in vivo imaging should address simultaneously: (i) design of nanostructures with stealth 

properties that prevent them from being opsonised or cleared before reaching the target cells, (ii) ability 

to penetrate into cells and crossover biological barriers like the blood-brain barrier, uptake and recycling 

of nanostructures, (iii) trans-endocytosis of nanostructures, (iv)  safety evaluation (in vitro/in vivo 

cytotoxicity, haemocompatibility and immunogenicity), in vivo carrier biodistribution, and (v) compatibility 

with external activation by magnetic field, ultrasound, X-ray, or optics to trigger the therapeutic activity. 

For example, Sashiwa et al. [48] has demonstrated to be possible the development of tree-like 

hyperbranched chitosan-dendrimer hybrids. These macromolecules were described as based on 

chitosan (a trunk) linked to the dendrimer (sub-branch), which can possibly linking a variety of peptides 

or sugar molecules (the leaf’s or flower’s). In our approach, we modify amine-terminated 

poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers with water-soluble carboxymethylchitosan (CMCht) as an 

attempt to functionalize the dendrimers and neutralize the amine groups, which have been found to be 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods  

 
 

- 103 - 
 

responsible for the toxicity of the dendrimers [49,50]. These macromolecules instead of trees can be 

called as dendrons or dendronized polymers due to their similar architecture (see Figure 5, Chapter I). 

3.1. CARBOXYMETHYLCHITOSAN/POLY(AMIDOAMINE) DENDRIMER (CMCHT/PAMAM) NANOPARTICLES 

For the synthesis of the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer macromolecules, carboxymethylchitosan with a DD 

of 80% and DS of 47% was used. Starburst® poly(amidoamine)-carboxylic terminated dendrimers, 

PAMAM-CT (generation 1.5, 20% (w/v) methanolic solution) with an ethylenediamine core were 

purchased from Aldrich. Carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer (CMCht/PAMAM) 

nanoparticles were prepared in a stepwise manner as described in Figure 6: (i) increasing the 

generation of the PAMAM-CT (G 1.5), (ii) obtaining a PAMAM-methyl ester terminated dendrimer, (iii) 

reaction of PAMAM and CMCht, i.e. the reaction goes through a condensation reaction between the 

methyl ester and amine groups [51], and (iv) modifying the methyl ester groups that do not react to 

carboxylic ones in the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer followed by precipitation. The increase of the 

dendrimers’ generation was carried by transferring an appropriate volume of PAMAM-CT (G 1.5) in 

methanol (MeOH) to a 2 mL volumetric flask. The solvent was evaporated off under nitrogen gas, and 

the traces dried under vacuum in order to completely remove the methanol. The starting compound was 

re-dissolved in ultra-pure water to give a final concentration of 10 mg.mL-1 and the pH was adjusted to 

6.5 with dilute hydrochloric acid solution (HCl) solution. Then, 1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl) 

carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) was added to the solution at a molar ratio sufficient to modify the 

carboxylate residue of the dendrimers and kept under agitation for 30 minutes at room temperature. 

Ethylenediamine (EDA) was added to the solution at a molar ratio equal to that of EDC and let react for 

at least 4 hours. After this period the exceeding EDC was removed by dialysis (benzoylated cellulose 

tubing for separating compounds with a molecular weight of ? 1,200 from compounds with a molecular 

weight &gt; 2,000). The compound was used without purification in the next step. After preparing the 

PAMAM-amine terminated compound, PAMAM-AT, an exhaustive alkylation of primary amines (Michael 

addition) was carried [52]. An appropriate volume of PAMAM-AT (~8.4 mmol) was transferred to a 50 mL 

flask and 30 mL of MeOH and 1.14 mL of methyl methacrylate (MA, ~12.6 mmol) were added. The 

solution was kept under agitation in a water bath for 24 hours at 50°C, to obtain the compound 

(PAMAM-methyl ester).

The carboxymethylchitosan (100 mg) dissolved in ultrapure water (10 mL) was mixed with the latter 

obtained PAMAM-methyl ester dendrimer (50 mg), which was previously dissolved in a 20/80 

water/methanol (v/v) solution. The final solution was diluted by adding 30 mL of methanol and kept 

under agitation for 72 hours. After this period, CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer with carboxylic-terminated 

groups were obtained as described elsewhere [51]. CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were then 

precipitated after addition of an appropriate volume of a saturated sodium carbonate, Na2CO3 solution 

and acetone.

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were mixed with a Dex solution with a final concentration of    

5 x 10-4 M under agitation (w/w). The mixture was then added to the precipitation media consisting of a 

saturated sodium carbonate, Na2CO3 and acetone solution, under vigorous agitation. Precipitates were 

collected by filtration and dispersed in ultrapure water for dialysis during the period of 48 hours. Both 

CMCht/PAMAM and Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were obtained by freezing 

the solution at -80°C and freeze-drying (Telstar-Cryodos -80, Spain) up to 4 days to complete remove 

the solvent. It is noteworthy that the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and Dex-loaded 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles are water-soluble at physiological pH.

3.3. LABELING OF CARBOXYMETHYLCHITOSAN/POLY(AMIDOAMINE) DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES WITH 

FLUORESCEIN ISOTHIOCYANATE 

In order to label the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer with a fluorescent probe a 10 mg.mL-1 FITC solution was 

prepared in anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), in dark conditions. Conjugates of CMCht/PAMAM-

FITC were prepared by covalently bonding the amine group of CMCht and the isothyocianate group of 

FITC (thiourea bond), as illustrated in Figure 7.

Firstly, a 10 mg.mL-1 CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles solution was prepared in a carbonate-

bicarbonate coupling buffer of pH 9.2. Then, 50 ?L of the FITC/DMSO solution was added per each mL 

of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles buffered solution under agitation, and kept in dark at 4°C for 

8 hours. The FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles solution was dialyzed against ultra-

pure water in order to remove unlinked FITC for 24 hours and filtered (pore size &amp;lt;220 nm) in sterile and 

dark conditions. The final product was obtained as an orange powder after freeze-drying.  

4. PHYSICOCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION TECHNIQUES  

4.1. MORPHOLOGICAL/MORPHOMETRIC CHARACTERIZATION 

4.1.1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 

In Chapter III, the microstructure of the CMCht/HAp composite scaffolds before and after immersion into 

the SBF solution, was investigated using scanning electron microscope, SEM (Leica Cambridge S-360, 

UK). Prior to the elemental and microstructure analysis, specimens were coated with carbon (Fisons 

Instruments, Polaron SC 508, UK) and gold (Fisons Instruments, Polaron SC 502, UK), respectively. 

The current was set at 18 mA with a coating time of 120 seconds. The phosphorus, calcium, sodium, 

carbon and oxygen elemental analysis was achieved by means of using an X-ray detector (Pentafet 

model 5526, UK) attached to the S-360 microscope, and a voltage of 10 keV was used. 

The same equipment and procedure were used for analysis of HAp and HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds.  



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods  

 
 
- 106 - 
 

For the in vitro studies using 3-D systems (Chapters IV and VIII), the surface morphology and pore size 

of the HAp scaffolds and SPCL scaffolds were also examined under a scanning electron microscope, 

SEM (SM-300, Topcon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Prior to microstructure analysis, specimens were 

sputter coated with platinum using an Ion coater (IB-3, Eiko Engineering Ltd., Ibaraki, Japan) with a 

current set at 6 mA, for a coating time of 2-3 minutes.  

4.1.2. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) 

The morphology and size of the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles was further analysed by 

transmission electron microscopy, TEM (Philips CM-12, FEI Company, The Netherlands, equipped with 

a MEGA VIEW-II DOCU camera and Image Software Analyzer SIS NT DOCU). The nanoparticles were 

stained with 2% of phosphotungstic acid and placed on copper grids for further observation. 

4.1.3. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies 

The morphology of the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM and CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles was 

also investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The dendrimer nanoparticles were dispersed in 

ultrapure water to obtain a solution with final concentration of 1 mg.mL-1, and then 20 ?L was placed 

over a 9.9 mm mica disc (Agar Scientific, England) and blown dried with nitrogen gas for subsequent 

characterization. The samples were analysed using the Tapping Mode™ with a MultiMode AFM 

connected to a NanoScope III controller, both from Veeco, USA, with non-contact silicon nanoprobes 

(ca 300 kHz) from Nanosensors, Switzerland. All images were plane-fitted using the third degree-flatten 

procedure included in the NanoScope software version 4.43r8. The particle size distribution was 

determined with the same software. 

4.1.4. Micro-computed tomography (µ-CT) analysis 

The structure and architecture of scaffolds are important factors affecting the performance of the tissue 

engineered cell-scaffold constructs. Micro-Computed Tomography (?-CT) is an expedite and 

nondestructive technique for examining the morphological and architectural characteristics of the 

scaffolds, namely pore size, porosity and interconnectivity [53]. 

Micro-Computed Tomography (?-CT) of the CMCht/HAp composite scaffolds was carried out using a 

Scanco 20 equipment (Scanco Medicals, Switzerland). Mimics® from Materialise (Belgium) was used as 

image processing software. The X-ray scans were performed in high resolution mode (9 µm) and 240 

slices of the materials were obtained. The 2-D morphometric analysis of the scaffolds was performed 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods  

 
 

- 107 - 
 

using a threshold 51 to identify the polymeric phase in order to determine the porosity, and a threshold 

133 to identify the hydroxylapatite content along the scaffold (from 0-2000 ?m). 

The 3-D structural and architectural information of the HAp scaffolds was assessed quantitatively and 

qualitatively using ?-CT analysis. A series of c.a. 900 2-D slices with a scanning resolution of 11 µm 

were obtained by irradiating the specimen with penetrative X-rays of 50 keV. Mimics® was also used as 

image processing software. The porosity along the HAp scaffolds was also evaluated by 2-D 

morphometric analysis using a threshold 300. In addition, the qualitative information of the HAp/CHT 

bilayered scaffolds architecture was also investigated. From the CT data set, 300 slices of a region of 

interest corresponding to the interface between HAp and CHT was used to investigate the continuity of 

the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds. A customized threshold technique was used to enhance the CHT 

contrast and remove noise. 

4.2. FOURIER-TRANSFORM INFRA-RED (FTIR) SPECTROSCOPY 

The presence and also the environment of functional groups in organic molecules can be identified in a 

non destructive manner by infrared spectroscopy. Fourier-transform infra-red (FTIR) analysis was 

performed using a Perkin-Elmer spectroscope (Perkin-Elmer 1600 series equipment). Transparent 

Potassium bromide (KBr) pellets were prepared by mixing in the ratio of 1:10 of sample/KBr (wt/wt), and 

milling in an agate mortar, followed by uniaxially pressing the powders. All transmission spectra were 

recorded in the region of 4400-450 cm-1, using a minimum of 32 scans, and a 2 cm-1 resolution. 

For evaluation of Dex incorporation into the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles FTIR analyses 

were also performed by means KBr pellets containing the samples. Moreover, the FITC labeling 

efficiency was also investigated. 

4.3. X-RAY DIFFRACTION (XRD) ANALYSIS 

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on powder samples of CMCht and CMCht/HAp 

composite scaffolds, using an X-ray diffractometer with Cu-K? radiation at 50 mA and 40 kV (Philips 

PW 1710, The Netherlands). Using flat plate geometry, data were collected from 2 to 62º 2? values, 

with a step size of 0.02º, and a counting time of 2 seconds.step-1.  

Crystallinity and phase content of HAp powder, sintered HAp and HAp scaffolds were also investigated. 

XRD patterns were examined in the region of 2º to 65º with a step size 0.02º for 2? and scan speed of 

0.6º.minute-1.

4.4. NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE (NMR) SPECTROSCOPY 

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a phenomenon which occurs when the nuclei of certain atoms 

are immersed in a static magnetic field and exposed to a second oscillating magnetic field. Some nuclei 

experience this phenomenon, and others do not, dependent upon whether they possess a property 

called spin. 1H NMR (least expensive analysis) is the application of nuclear magnetic resonance in NMR 

spectroscopy with respect to hydrogen nuclei within the molecules of a substance. This is a non-

destructive technique that allows determining the structure of organic compounds. Simple NMR spectra 

are recorded in solution, and solvent protons must not be allowed to interfere. In this thesis, 1H NMR 

analysis of the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles was carried to investigate the structure of the nanoparticles and incorporation of Dex. For 

this purpose, nanoparticles were dissolved in deuterated water (D2O). The NMR spectra were obtained 

with a Mercury -400BB operating at a frequency of 399.9 MHz at 50°C. The one-dimensional 1H spectra 

were acquired using a 45° pulse, a spectral width of 6.3 kHz and an acquisition time of 2.001 seconds.  

4.5. ZETA POTENTIAL AND PARTICLE SIZE ANALYSES 

Zeta potential and particle size of the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and Dex-loaded 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were measured in a particle size analyzer (Zetasizer Nano ZS, 

Malvern Instruments, UK).  

Zeta potential was calculated by determining the electrophoretic mobility and then applying the Henry 

equation. The electrophoretic mobility is obtained by performing an electrophoresis experiment on the 

sample and measuring the velocity of the particles using Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV). 

The Henry equation (1) is:  

UE=                            (1) 

z:  Zeta potential; 

UE:  Electrophoretic mobility; 

?:  Dielectric constant; 

?:  Viscosity; 

ƒ(Ka):  Henry’s function; the value used was 1.5, and is referred to as the Smoluchowski approximation. 

Electrophoretic determinations of Zeta potential were investigated using the universal ‘dip’ cell, at pH 3 

and pH 7.4, in a citrate buffer and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solutions, respectively.

Dynamic light scattering (DLS) that utilizes time variation of scattered light from suspended particles 

under Brownian motion to obtain their hydrodynamic size distribution is the most popular technology in 

sizing nanoparticles. DLS is a reliable technique that has been used to measure macromolecules and 

small particles in dilute suspension. Thus, for the present study, particle size analyses were performed 

using the DLS technique. The analyses were carried out in aqueous media with low concentration of 

nanoparticles and using disposable sizing cuvettes.  

4.6. ULTRAVIOLET-VISIBLE (UV-VIS) SPECTROPHOTOMETRY 

The FITC bonding to CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and FITC:CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles ratio was also investigated by UV-VIS spectrophotometry (NanoDropTM ND-1000; 

NanoDrop Technologies, USA). The labelling efficiency and stability was investigated by UV-VIS 

spectrophotometry.  

4.7. THERMOGRAVIMETRIC ANALYSIS 

Thermal stability and composition of the PU sponges, PU sponge impregnated with HAp before burning, 

and HAp scaffolds sintered at 1300°C was assessed by thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis. A TA-Q500 

analyser (TA Instruments, USA) was used. The data was obtained using a ramp rate of 5°C.minute-1. 

4.8. MECHANICAL CHARACTERIZATION 

Compression tests in dry state were performed using a Universal Testing Machine (Instron 4505) 

possessing a load cell of 50 kN. A minimum number of 10 CMCht/HAp scaffolds were tested after 

storage at ~20°C and 55% relative humidity, to obtain an averaged result. Tests were conducted up to 

failure or until 60% reduction in specimen height as previously reported by Boesel et al. [54]. 

Complementarily, compression tests ‘Push-out’ in wet state were carried out by means of using a 

Miniature Materials Tester (Minimat Vsn 3.1, Rheometric Scientific Ltd, UK). This equipment is capable 

of sensing full scale load ranges from 20 N up to 1000 N at 37°C. Before conducting the tests, 

CMCht/HAp composite scaffolds were introduced inside the perforated stainless steel shells (6 mm of 

diameter and 11 mm height), and soaked into a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution for 24 hours 

at 37°C inside an oven. Afterwards, the shells containing the composite scaffolds were immersed into 

PBS solution at 37°C and a minimum number of 5 samples were tested. A baseline was also performed 

for each sample using the same experimental conditions but running the experiments with the empty 

stainless steel shells.  



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods  

 
 
- 110 - 
 

Mechanical properties of the HAp scaffolds were also investigated using the Universal Testing Machine 

(Instron 4505), at room temperature. The gauge length and diameter of all specimens was 16 mm and 8 

mm, respectively. Tests were conducted with a constant strain rate of 2 mm.minute-1, and up to failure 

or until 60% reduction in specimen height. The modulus (E) was determined by linear regression from 

the slopes in the initial elastic portion of the stress-strain diagram. A minimum number of 10 specimens 

were tested, and then E was averaged from the ten measurements. 

4.9. SWELLING AND WEIGHT-LOSS STUDIES 

Water-uptake or swelling and weight loss of the developed CMCht/HAp composite scaffolds, HAp and 

HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds were performed, by soaking into a PBS solution for times up to 30 days, in 

triplicate. The solution was prepared by dissolving 1 tablet of PBS in 200 mL of distilled water to obtain a 

final concentration of 0.0027 M potassium chloride and 0.137 M sodium chloride, pH 7.4 at 25°C. The 

water-uptake was determined by the changes on the initial mass of the scaffolds (mi) after incubation in 

the PBS solution at 37 ? 1°C. The scaffolds were removed after 1, 3, 7, 15, 21 and 30 days of 

immersion; then the excess of solution removed out with a filter paper, and the mass (mw) determined 

using an analytical balance. Finally the scaffolds were dried at 60°C until constant weight and the mass 

was determined (md) in order to obtain the weight loss. The percentage of water-uptake of scaffolds 

(WUs) after each time of immersion (t) was calculated by means of using equation (2), 

 

 

The percentage of weight loss of the scaffolds (WLs) after each time of immersion (t) was calculated 

using equation (3), 

 

 

 

 

 

WUs,t = [(mw,t-mi)/ mi] x 100  (2) 

WLs,t = [(md,t-mi)/ mi] x 100  (3)

4.10. IN VITRO BIOACTIVITY ASSESSMENT 

Bioactivity tests were performed by soaking the CMCht/HAp composite scaffolds and HAp scaffolds in a 

simulated body fluid (SBF) solution at 37 ? 1°C for periods of time ranging from 1 to 30 days. Note that 

this solution contains the inorganic ion concentrations resembling to those found in human blood plasma 

and pH of 7.4 [55]. After each soaking time the scaffolds were removed from the SBF solution and 

immediately rinsed with distilled water, dried at room temperature for 24 hours and in the oven at 60ºC 

until constant weight. The concentration of the Ca and P ions, after each soaking time, was measured 

by inductively-coupled plasma optical emission (ICP-OES, JY 70 plus, JobinYvon, France) 

spectrometry. Triplicate samples were analyzed for each soaking time and an averaged result 

calculated. 

4.11. INVESTIGATION OF DEXAMETHASONE (DEX) RELEASE FROM CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES 

 The amounts of Dex from nanoparticles were measured using the high performance liquid 

chromatography (HPLC, ASI-Knauer, Germany) equipment with an UV detector set at 246 nm. The 

mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile:acetate buffer (2 mM, pH 4.8-adjusted with glacial acetic acid) 

(50:50 v/v) at flow-rate of 1 mL.minute-1. In brief, Dex release was studied after dissolution of 10 mg of 

Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles in 10 mL of phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.4, 

Sigma, USA) solution (PBS) in the absence or presence of 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Sodium 

azide 0.01% (w/v) was added to the buffer. The in vitro release studies were performed at 37?C and 60 

rpm for times ranging from 1 hour until 7 days. At set time intervals, 1 mL of sample was taken for 

analysis and the same volume replaced by the respective buffer solution. Prior analysis, samples were 

centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 10 minutes. A solution with sample/acetonitrile/acetate buffer (50:25:25, 

v/v) was prepared for further analysis. A Eurospher 100 C-18 analytical column (ASI-Knauer, Germany) 

was used. The retention time of Dex was 4 minutes. A calibration curve was obtained following the 

method described by Sun et al. [56]. Results were expressed as an average ± standard deviation, n=6.

CHAPTER II. Materials and methods  

 
 
- 112 - 
 

Rat bone marrow stromal cells (RBMSCs) isolated from Fisher 344 rat (F344/N) were used to evaluate 

the osteogenic potential of the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles, in vitro and in vivo 

(Chapters VI, VIII, IX, and X). Seven-week-old Fischer 344/N male rats were purchased from Japan 

SLC Inc. (Shizuoka, Japan) and sacrificed in accordance with the Ethics Committee at the Tissue 

Engineering Research Center (Amagasaki, Japan). The epiphyseal regions of the femora were removed 

and marrow plugs in the femoral shafts were flushed out using Eagle’s minimum essential medium 

(MEM, Nacalai Tesque, Japan) supplemented with 15% FBS (JRH Biosciences, USA) and 1% 

antibiotic-antimycotic, A/B (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) solution [57]. The RBMSCs isolation was performed 

under aseptic conditions. RBMSCs were transferred to a T75 cm2 culture flask and expanded in the 

presence of complete MEM medium at 37ºC in a 5% CO2 incubator. Then, the culture medium was 

changed every 2 or 3 days. After reaching confluency, the cells (passage 1, P1) were released from 

substratum with 1 mL of 0.05% tripsin-0.53 mM EDTA (Invitrogen, USA) and centrifuged at 900 rpm for 

5 minutes. A cell suspension was prepared and cell concentration determined using an automatic cell 

counter (Cell Counter Sysmex F-520, Japan).  

5.1.1.2. Goat bone marrow stromal cells (GBMSCs) 

Goat bone marrow stromal cells (GBMSCs) were isolated from the iliac crest of adult goats and cultured 

with basic culture medium - DMEM (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) 

supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% A/B solution, under standard culture conditions. Cells were 

cultured until confluence and sub-cultured at P1 and P2 before seeding.  

5.1.2. Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons 

Hippocampal neuron cultures were prepared from P4 Wistar rats [58]. Upon dissection, hippocampus 

tissue samples were submitted to a trypsin based enzymatic digestion (0.05% Trypsin – Gibco; 3 

mg.mL-1 BSA; 0.0025% DNase in EBSS) for 10 minutes, followed by mechanical dissociation and 

centrifugation. Isolated cells were then plated on poly-D-lysine coated coverslips at a density of 4 x 104 

cells.cm-2. Cultures were maintained (37°C, 5% CO2/95% air, 90% relative humidity) in Neurobasal A 

medium plus B27 Supplement, 1 mM GlutamaxI, 10 ng.mL-1 basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) and 

0.1 mg.mL-1 kanamycin (all from Gibco, USA) for 7 days. From day seven onwards two sets of 

experiments were performed: (i) in order to determine the internalization times of FITC-labeled 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles by hippocampal neurons, cultures were incubated with 200 

?g.mL-1 nanoparticles for periods of 1, 2, 6, 12, 15, 18, 24 and 48 hours; and (ii) to understand whether 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods  

 
 

- 113 - 
 

the  maintenance of the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM concentration in the culture medium was 

essential to maintain the levels of internalization, cultures were incubated for periods up to 7 days in 

which FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were added to the culture medium every 

48 hours in one group, while in the other nanoparticles were only added on the beginning of the 

experiment (day 0). 

5.1.3. Primary cultures of cortical glial cells 

Cortical glial cells were isolated from P4 newborns (Wistar Rats) as previously described [59]. Upon 

dissection, cortices were submitted to an enzymatic cocktail (30 mg.mL-1 DNase, 0.25% Trypsin, both 

from Sigma) in Ca and Mg free HBSS followed by mechanical dissociation. Glial cells were then 

obtained by centrifuging the resulting cells suspension at 800 rpm for 2 minutes, and plated out on 

coverslips previously coated with poly-D-lysine at a density of 4 x 104 cells.cm-2. Glial cells were then 

maintained for one week in DMEM supplemented with 1% A/B and 10% FBS. At this time point similar 

experiments to those performed with hippocampal cultures were carried out. In order to determine if 

astrocyte and oligodendrocyte cells proliferation was affecting the levels of internalization after 7 days of 

incubation with or without renovation, cultures were allow to grow and establish, being later on treated at 

day 7 (within a 14 day culturing period time frame) with 5-fluoro-2’-deoxiuridina (FUdR), a known 

inhibitor of glial cell proliferation. 

5.2. CELL SEEDING TECHNIQUES 

5.2.1. Seeding of GBMSCs onto the HAp porous layer of bilayered scaffolds and 3-D culturing  

After expansion, GBMSCs were enzymatically lifted with 3 mL of trypsin after reaching 80% of 

confluence at P1 or P2. A cell suspension was prepared and seeded onto the HAp porous layer in a 

scaffold drop-wise manner, at a cellular density of 2.1 x 105 cells.mL-1. GBMSCs-scaffolds constructs 

were cultured in 48-well plates for 3 days with basic medium in static conditions. For inducing 

osteogenic differentiation, cell-seeded scaffolds were cultured with an osteogenic media consisting of 

alpha-MEM (Minimal Essential Medium Eagle alpha modification) supplemented with osteogenic 

supplements namely, 10-8 M Dex, 50 ?g.mL-1 ascorbic acid and 10 mM ?-glycerophosphate. The 

constructs were cultured for 3 days in static cultures with basal medium plus 14 days in osteogenic 

medium (17 days) and under dynamic conditions by using a lab rotator (Model DSR 2800 V, Digisystem 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods  

 
 
- 114 - 
 

Laboratory Instruments Inc., Taiwan). Samples were collected on day 0 (12 hours after seeding), day 3 

and day 17 for further studies. 

5.2.2. Seeding of GBMSCs onto the CHT porous layer of bilayered scaffolds and 3-D culturing  

To induce chondrogenic differentiation, CHT scaffolds were seeded with 2.5 x 105 GBMSCs and 

cultured for 7, 21 and 28 days with chondrogenic medium consisting of DMEM supplemented with 10 

ng.mL-1 recombinant human transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-?1) (Sigma, USA), ITS+1 (100 x 

liquid media supplement), 0.1 M sodium pyruvate, 35 mM proline, 17 mM ascorbic acid and 1 mM Dex. 

The cell-scaffold constructs were also cultured under dynamic conditions by using a lab rotator system. 

Samples were retrieved after 7, 21 and 28 days of chondrogenic culture. Before chondrogenic medium 

was added, samples were cultured for 3 days in basal medium in static conditions. In both cases, 

culture media were changed every 2-3 days. 

5.2.3. Seeding of RBMSCs onto the HAp and SPCL scaffolds for the in vitro and in vivo studies   

The RBMSCs (passage 1, P1) were released from substratum with 1 mL of 0.05% tripsin-0.53 mM 

EDTA (Invitrogen, USA) and centrifuged at 900 rpm for 5 minutes, after reach confluence. The 

supernatant was aspirated and cells re-suspended with 10 mL of complete culture medium. Cell 

concentration was determined using an automatic cell counter (Cell Counter Sysmex F-520, Japan). 

Prior seeding, the viability of the RBMSCs was also analyzed with a NucleoCounter (ChemoMetec A/S, 

Denmark) [60]. In addition, the HAp scaffolds were de-aired in MEM medium under vacuum [61]. Then, 

one scaffold was placed in a well of 96-well tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) plate and RBMSCs 

seeded in a drop-wise manner. RBMSCs expanded in complete MEM medium, MEM medium 

supplemented with 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and MEM 

medium supplemented with 10-8 M Dex were seeded onto each HAp and SPCL scaffolds. The effect of 

cell density was evaluated by seeding different cell numbers (1 x 106 and 2 x 105) onto the HAp 

scaffolds. Finally, RBMSCs-HAp and RBMSCs-SPCL scaffolds constructs were cultured in complete 

MEM medium under standard culture conditions to allow cell adhesion, for the period of 12 hours. The 

same protocol was carried out for the in vitro studies, though different numbers of RBMSCs per scaffold 

were tested.

5.3. DNA QUANTIFICATION 

Assessment of GBMSCs proliferation was carried out by DNA quantification. For this purpose, a 

fluorimetric dsDNA quantification kit (PicoGreen, Molecular Probes) was used. The samples were 

collected on day 0, day 3 and day 17, washed twice with a sterile PBS solution and transferred into 1.5 

mL microtubes containing 1 mL of ultra-pure water. GBMSCs-HAp and -CHT were incubated for 1 hour 

at 37ºC in a water-bath and then stored in a -80ºC freezer until testing. Prior to DNA quantification 

constructs were thawed and sonicated for 15 minutes. Samples and standards (ranging between 0 and 

2 µg.mL-1) were prepared per each well of an opaque 96-well plate were added 28.7 µL of sample or 

standard plus 71.3 µL of PicoGreen solution and 100 µL of Tris-EDTA buffer. Triplicates were made for 

each sample or standard. The plate was incubated for 10 minutes in the dark and fluorescence was 

measured on a microplate ELISA reader (BioTek, USA) using an emission of 490 nm and an 

absorbance wavelength of 520 nm. A standard curve was created and sample DNA values were read 

off from the standard graph. 

By its turn, DNA quantification in 2-D and 3-D cultures using RBMSCs (Chapters IV, VI and VIII) were 

performed using the nuclear dye Hoechst 33258 (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) according to the method 

previously described [62]. Prior to the assay, the RBMSCs-scaffold constructs were washed with a Ca 

and Mg-free PBS solution. Then, constructs were transferred to a 2 mL eppendorf, pulverized with 

zirconia’s balls (milling time of ~2 minutes at 25 shakes.second-1) using a ball mixer mill (Retsch GmbH, 

Germany), and sonicated in 0.2% Triton-X (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) solution for 5 minutes. Finally, the 

samples were sonicated and the DNA quantification carried out. The standard DNA solutions were 

prepared using salmon sperm DNA (Invitrogen, USA). 

5.4. CYTOTOXICITY SCREENING  

5.4.1. MTS assay 

MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) 

viability test was performed to determine the cytotoxicity of HAp porous scaffolds and HAp/CHT 

bilayered scaffolds leachables that might result from the processing methodology used to obtain the 

HAp scaffolds and/or leachables of the polymeric component of the bilayered materials. Mouse 

fibroblastic-like cells (L929 cells; European collection of cell cultures-ECACC, UK), were cultured in 

basic medium: DMEM without phenol red supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% A/B solution containing 

10,000 units.mL-1 penicillin G sodium, 10,000 ?g.mL-1 streptomycin sulphate and 25 ?g.mL-1

amphotericin B as Fungizone® in 0.85% saline solution. L929 cells were incubated at 37ºC in an 

atmosphere containing 5% of CO2, and after achieving confluence a cell suspension was prepared with 

a concentration of 8 x 104 cells.mL-1 and seeded onto 96-well TCPS plates. L929 cells were incubated 

for 3 days with different concentrations of HAp and HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds extracts (25, 50, 75 

and 100%). Eight replicates were considered per sample. Extracts of all samples were prepared as 

previously described by Gomes et al. [31]. L929 cells relative viability (%) was determined for each 

extract concentration and compared to TCPS. Latex extracts were used as a positive control of cellular 

death. All cytotoxicity tests were performed in triplicate. 

For both neurons and glial cells, cell viability and metabolic activity was also assessed by the MTS test 

(Chapter VII), after seven days of incubation (with or without renovation) with FITC-labeled 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. This assay, or others similar to it (MTT, WST-1), have been 

widely used to measure cellular viability and proliferation. Hippocampal neurons and glial cells cultures 

(n=3) were placed in culture medium containing MTS in a 5:1 ratio and incubated in a humidified 

atmosphere at 37ºC and 5% CO2. After three hours of incubation 100 ?L of solution from each well 

were transferred to a 96-well TCPS plate and the optical density was determined at 490 nm.  

5.4.2. Total protein quantification 

In order to complement the data obtained with the MTS test (Chapter VII), protein assay was carried out 

to relate the amount of adherent cells present in the cultures using the BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce 

Chemical, USA). The bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay is a rapid and convenient method for the 

determination of the relative number of adherent cells in tissue culture [63]. This system uses BCA as the 

detection reagent for Cu+1, which is formed when Cu+2 is reduced by protein in an alkaline environment. 

The purple coloured reaction product is formed by the chelation of two molecules of BCA with one 

cuprous ion (Cu+1). The BCA method provides a more rapid and sensitive procedure with greater 

stability of color than is obtained using the Lowry method. Cells were lysed in ultra-pure H2O after which 

the total protein was quantified according to the manufacturer’s protocol. At the end of the assay,      

100 ?L of each sample were transferred to a 96-well plate where a standard curve was prepared and 

the absorbance read at 562 nm in a multi-well plate reader (Tecan, USA). 

5.4.3. Luminescent cell viability assay and osmolality 

A luminescent cell viability assay based on the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) quantification was 

performed by exposing RBMSCs to CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles (Chapter VI). RBMSCs 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods

were isolated from femora of 7 week-old male Fischer 344/N rats (SLC Inc. Japan), and expanded in 

T75 cm2 culture flasks in the presence of MEM with 15% FBS (JRH Biosciences, USA) and 1% A/B 

(Nacalai Tesque, Japan) solution. The animals were sacrificed by administrating an excess of 

anesthesia, in accordance to the Ethics Committee at the Tissue Engineering Research Center 

(Amagasaki, Japan). After reaching confluency, the cells (passage 1, P1) were released from 

substratum and centrifuged at 900 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatant was aspirated and cells re-

suspended with 10 mL of complete culture medium. Cell concentration was determined using an 

automatic cell counter (Cell Counter Sysmex F-520, Japan). RBMSCs were seeded (sub-cultured) to 

each well of a 96-well TCPS plate at a cell density of 5 x 103 cells.mL-1. A solution of CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles at a concentration of 10 mg.mL-1 was prepared in a complete culture medium. 

Serial dilutions (1, 0.1, 0.01 mg.mL-1) were further prepared using the complete culture medium. 

Possible changes in the osmolality of the culture media were investigated using an automatic cryoscopic 

osmometer (OSMOMAT O 30-D, Gonotec, Germany). After a period of 24 hours, the culture medium 

was changed by the respective serial dilutions and the cells cultured under standard culture conditions 

for 1 and 3 days. A latex rubber extract was used as the positive control for cellular death. Finally, the 

ATP content was measured by means of performing a CellTiter-Glo® luminescent cell viability assay, 

following the protocol provided by the supplier (Promega Corporation, USA). Luminescence was 

measured using opaque-walled multi-well plate in a microplate reader (Wallac ARVOsx 1420, Perkin-

Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, USA).  

Cytotoxicity screening of the HAp and SPCL scaffolds using RBMSCs was also investigated, in vitro 

(Chapter VIII) by luminescent cell viability assay [64]. Prior to RBMSCs seeding, the HAp and SPCL 

scaffolds were pretreated (de-airation) to prevent air bubble formation in the pores. Scaffolds were 

placed in 10 mL polystyrene tubes with ventilation caps. MEM medium was added and scaffolds were 

de-aired under vacuum using a 20 mL syringe with an attached 21G needle. Then, each scaffold was 

transferred into the respective well of a non-adherent 96-well TCPS plate. RBMSCs (P1) were seeded 

onto the surface of the HAp and SPCL scaffolds at a cell density of 5 x 102 cells.scaffold-1, 1 x 103 

cells.scaffold-1, 5 x 103 cells.scaffold-1 and 1 x 104 cells.scaffold-1, and cultured in MEM medium under 

static conditions for 24 hours, 3 and 7 days. After each time period, the ATP content which signals the 

presence of metabolically active cells was measured by means of performing a CellTiter-Glo® 

luminescent cell viability assay (Promega Corporation, USA). Luminescence was measured in a 

microplate reader (Wallac ARVOsx 1420, Perkin-Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, USA), following 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods  

 
 
- 118 - 
 

the protocol provided by the supplier. All experiments were carried out 3 times using 3 replicates per 

experimental condition.  

5.5. LIVE/DEAD VIABILITY ASSAY AND ADHESION STUDIES 

For study cell adhesion and proliferation onto the surface of the HAp scaffolds (Chapter IV), RBMSCs 

were firstly, isolated and expanded as previously described. After that, RBMSCs were seeded onto the 

HAp scaffolds at a cellular density of 5 x 102 cells.scaffold-1, 1 x 103 cells.scaffold-1, 5 x103 cells.scaffold-1 

and 1 x 104 cells.scaffold-1 and cultured in MEM medium for 24 hours, 3 and 7 days under static 

conditions. After each time period, the ATP content which signals the presence of metabolically active 

cells was measured by means of performing a CellTiter-Glo® luminescent cell viability assay (Promega 

Corporation, USA). The luminescence was measured using opaque-walled multi-well plate in a 

microplate reader (Wallac ARVOsx 1420, Perkin-Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, USA). This assay 

is based on a luminescence signal that is proportional to the amount of ATP, which by its turn is directly 

proportional to the number of viable cells. Moreover, cell adhesion and proliferation was investigated by 

means of using a LIVE/DEAD viability assay kit (Molecular Probes). RBMSCs were incubated with two 

probes, calcein-AM (green colour) and ethidium homodimer-1 (EtdD-1, bright red colour), for 

intracellular esterase activity and plasma membrane integrity, respectively [65]. Then, specimens were 

observed under a 3-D fluorescence microscope (Olympus SZX12 stereomicroscope, OLYMPUS Co. 

Ltd., Japan) and SEM. All experiments were carried out three times using a minimum of 3 samples per 

experimental condition. By its turn, GBMSCs adhesion and morphology onto the surface of the 

HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds was investigated by SEM analysis (Chapter V). For this purpose, after 

each culturing period, samples were removed from culture, washed in PBS, fixed in 2.5% 

glutaraldehyde, rinsed two times with PBS and dehydrated in series of ethanol concentrations. The 

samples were then dried at room temperature and sputter coated with gold before observation under the 

SEM. 

5.6. ASSESSMENT OF FITC-LABELED CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES INTERNALIZATION 

5.6.1. Fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses 

In this thesis, the internalization of the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles was 

investigated using different cells types (Chapters VI, VII and X), both by fluorescence microscopy and 

fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses. 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods  

 
 

- 119 - 
 

Human osteoblast-like cells (SaOs-2 cells, ECACC, UK) were used in preliminary tests to evaluate the 

internalization of the nanoparticles. SaOs-2 cells were maintained in T75 cm2 culture flasks, cultured 

with basic culture medium - DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% A/B, and passaged after 

reaching confluence. A cell suspension was prepared and seeded on TCPS coverslips (Sarstedt Inc., 

USA) in 24-well plates (1 x 104 cells.well-1) and cultured in standard culture conditions for 24 hours. The 

internalization of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles by SaOs-2 cells was assessed after 3, 12, 24 

hours, and 14 days. After each time point cells on the TCPS coverslips were fixed with 4% formalin and 

the nuclei stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dilactate, DAPI blue (100 ng.mL-1; Molecular 

Probes), for assessing possible cell morphological changes. Fluorescence was protected by using an 

antifade agent (ProLong® Antifade Kit, Invitrogen, USA), following the supplier procedure and cells 

were observed under the fluorescence microscope (AxioImager Z1, Zeiss Inc., Germany). 

RBMSCs were isolated from rats and expanded until reaching 80% of confluency. The RBMSCs (P1) 

were trypsinized and transferred to a 6-well (1 x 105 cells.well-1) and a TCPS coverslips in 24-well TCPS 

plates (2 x 104 cells.well-1) for analysis under FACS and fluorescence microscopy, respectively. For 

fluorescence microscopy, RBMSCs were cultured in a MEM complete culture medium containing the  

0.1 mg.mL-1 FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles for a period of 12 hours until 14 

days. For FACS analysis RBMSCs were cultured in the presence of 0.01 mg.mL-1 FITC-labeled 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. All experiments were carried out in triplicate. The samples for 

fluorescence microscopy were prepared as follows: each well was washed with 1 mL of PBS, and cells 

fixed with 4% formalin (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) for 10 minutes at 4ºC followed by washing each well 

twice with PBS. After that cells were incubated with 0.5 mL of PBS containing Texas Red?-X phalloidin 

(Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, USA) and Hoechst 33258 (Invitrogen, USA) for staining the actin 

filaments of the cytoskeleton and nuclei of cells, respectively. The protocols provided by the supplier 

were followed with few modifications. The permeabilization of cells with Triton? X-100 was not carried 

out to avoid any undesired effect over the integrity of cells nuclei. TCPS coverslips were washed once 

with PBS and fluorescence protected using the ProLong® antifade kit. The specimens were observed 

under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX70, Olympus Co. Ltd., Japan). FACS analysis was carried 

out as follows: each well of the 6-well plate was washed with 2 mL of PBS. Then, PBS was aspirated 

and cells released from substratum as described above. Afterwards, it was added to each well 3.5 mL of 

MEM complete medium and samples transferred to a 15 mL Falcon tube. After centrifugation at 900 rpm 

for 5 min, cells were re-suspended in 0.5 mL of complete culture medium and passed through cell 

strainers [66]. Afterwards, 1 ?L propidium iodide (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) was added to each sample for 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods

determining the number of live cells. After this step, cells were loaded in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer 

(BD Biosciences Imunocytometry Systems, USA) and analyzed with a minimum of 10,000 events 

counting. Calibrite beads three-color kit (BD CaliBRITETM beads, USA) was used to adjust the 

equipment instrument settings before samples are run on the flow cytometer. Finally, the FACS data 

was treated using the FLOWJO software. 

5.6.2. Immunocytochemistry 

For internalization studies using neurons and glial cells, immunocytochemistry studies were also carried 

out. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes, permeabilized by incubation with 

100% methanol for 2 minutes, and washed three times in PBS. Cells were then blocked with 10% 

FBS/PBS (60 minutes), followed by a 1 hour incubation with the following primary antibodies: mouse 

anti-rat microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP-2) (Sigma, USA, 1:500) to detect mature hippocampal 

neurons, rabbit anti-rat glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) (Dako, Denmark, 1:500) for astrocytes, mouse 

anti-CD11b (BD Biosciences Pharmigen, USA, 1:100) for microglial cells and mouse anti-O4 (R&amp;amp;D 

systems, USA, 1:50) for oligodendrocytes. Cells were then washed in PBS and incubated with the 

secondary antibody: Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Alexa Fluor goat 

anti-rabbit 488 (Molecular Probes, USA) for 60 minutes. The primary antibody was omitted to produce 

negative controls. Samples were further observed under an Olympus BX-61 Fluorescence Microscope 

(Olympus, Germany). Levels of FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles internalization by 

the different cell populations was quantified by determining the rate between the number of positive cells 

for FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM internalization and the total number of cells (n=3, 5 random fields per 

coverslip). 

5.7. INVESTIGATION OF THE MECHANISM OF INTERNALIZATION OF FITC-LABELED CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER 

NANOPARTICLES  

For the investigation of the mechanism by which dendrimer nanoparticles are internalized by cells 

restrictive molecules were used, namely colchicine and apyrase known for inhibiting endocytosis and 

the active nuclear translocation, respectively. A cell suspension of RBMSCs (P1) in MEM complete 

culture medium was transferred to a 6-well (1 x 105 cells.well-1) and TCPS coverslips in 24-well TCPS 

plates (2 x 104 cells.well-1) for analysis under FACS and fluorescence microscopy, respectively. Stock 

solutions of 10 U.mL-1 apyrase (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) and 10 µM colchicine (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) 

were prepared in a phosphate-buffered saline solution. Cells were incubated in standard culture 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods

conditions and after 24 hours, the culture medium was replaced by a different complete culture medium 

containing the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles (0.01 mg.mL-1 and 0.1 mg.mL-1), 

and in the presence of 1 µM colchicine and 0.1 U.mL-1 apyrase or both, for a period of 12 hours to 14 

days. Controls for internalization were performed by culturing RBMSCs in complete culture medium and 

in the presence of both colchicine and apyrase. All experiments were carried out in triplicate. After each 

time period, specimens were prepared as described previously. The tendency of FITC-labeled 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles to be internalized by RBMSCs was investigated by means of 

FACS analysis.  

5.8. IN VITRO OSTEOGENIC DIFFERENTIATION STUDIES 

For the evaluation of osteogenic differentiation of the RBMSCs cultured in the presence of Dex-loaded 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles, in vitro: RBMSCs were isolated from F344/N rats and 

expanded as described before. RBMSCs (P1) were cultured in a TCPS 24-well plate at a cell density of 

2 x 104 cells.well-1, and cultured in a complete MEM medium for 24 hours. After that time, culture 

medium was replaced by the different culture media, and RBMSCs cultured for times up to 14 days. The 

effect of the concentration of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles loaded with Dex on the RBMSCs 

osteogenic differentiation was investigated. Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were 

dissolved in MEM medium supplemented with 0.28 mM ascorbic acid (Wako Pure Chemicals, Japan) 

and 10 mM ?-glycerophosphate at a final concentration of 0.01 and 1 mg.mL-1. RBMSCS were also 

cultured in a complete MEM medium, complete MEM medium containing 1 mg.mL-1 of CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles, and complete MEM medium containing 10 mM ?-glycerophosphate (negative 

controls). Complete MEM medium supplemented with 10-8 M Dex, 0.28 mM ascorbic acid and 10 mM ?-

glycerophosphate was used as the positive control for osteogenic differentiation. Culture media were 

changed every 2-3 days. All experiments were carried out 3 times using a minimum of 4 replicates per 

experimental condition. 

Moreover, the osteogenic differentiation of RBMSCs seeded onto the surface of the HAp and SPCL 

scaffolds and cultured with Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles was also investigated. 

RBMSCs were isolated and expanded as mentioned above. HAp and SPCL scaffolds were placed in 

each well of a 96-well TCPS plate. Then, 1 x 106 RBMSCs (P1) were added per each HAp and SPCL 

scaffold, and the constructs were cultured in complete MEM medium under standard culture conditions 

for the period of 12 hours to allow cell adhesion. After that time, cell-scaffold constructs were transferred 

to a non-treated and non-protein coated flat bottom 12-well TCPS plate (Nunc, Japan), the different 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods  

 
 
- 122 - 
 

culture medium was added, and RBMSCs were cultured for times up to 14 days. RBMSCs were 

exposed to a MEM medium supplemented with 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles, 0.28 mM ascorbic acid (Wako Pure Chemicals, Japan) and 10 mM ?-glycerophosphate. 

RBMSCS were also cultured in a complete MEM medium (negative control for osteogenic 

differentiation). A complete MEM medium supplemented with 10-8 M Dex, 0.28 mM ascorbic acid and 10 

mM ?-glycerophosphate was used as the positive control for osteogenic differentiation. All experiments 

were carried out 3 times using a minimum of 3 replicates per experimental condition.  

5.8.1. Qualitative analysis of mineralization  

For 2-D in vitro studies (Chapter VI), Alizarin red S staining was performed to investigate possible 

calcium deposition after 14 days of culturing. RBMSCs were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 95% 

ethanol for 15 minutes. The fixed cells were then washed once with PBS and stained with 5 mg.mL-1 

Alizarin red S in PBS for 5 minutes at room temperature. Then, it followed a washing step with ultra-pure 

water and mounting with Crystal/MountTM (BiomedaCorporation, USA) for observation under the phase 

contrast microscope (Olympus CK40, Olympus Co. Ltd., Japan). 

For the 3-D in vitro studies (Chapter VIII),  RBMSCs-HAp and -SPCL scaffolds constructs were washed 

twice with Ca and Mg-free PBS solution and cells fixed with 95% ethanol for 15 minutes [67]. The fixed 

cells were then washed once with PBS and stained with 5 mg.mL-1 Alizarin red S in Ca and Mg-free 

PBS solution for 5 minutes at room temperature. After a washing step with ultra-pure water, RBMSCs-

scaffold construct specimens were examined under a 3-D fluorescence microscope. 

5.8.2. Quantitative analysis of mineralization (calcein uptake) 

The degree of mineralization was quantitatively and qualitatively investigated following the method 

described by Uchimura et al. [68]. Succinctly, the method consists on the culturing of the RBMSCs in the 

presence of 1 ?g.mL-1 of calcein (Dojindo Laboratories, Japan), which is incorporated in the mineralized 

extracellular matrix and allow us to investigate the calcium deposition.  After each time period, each well 

was washed twice with PBS after which 1 mL of PBS was added. The fluorescence of calcein 

incorporated into the mineralized matrices was both visualized and quantified in a image analyzer 

equipment (Typhoon 8600 Variable Mode Imager, Amersham Biosciences, USA) using a 526 nm short 

pass filter. Afterwards, the fluorescence of the incorporated calcein was also observed under a 

fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX70, OLYMPUS Co. Ltd., Japan). 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods

5.8.3. Qualitative analysis of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 

For the 2-D in vitro studies (Chapter VI), ALP staining the RBMSCs were washed twice the wells with 

PBS, after each culture period. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) for 

15 minutes at 4ºC and then washed twice with AMP buffer (56 mM of 2-amino-2methyl-1,3-propanediol 

in ultrapure water, pH 9.9). It followed the soaking step with staining solution 0.5 mg naphtol AS-MX 

phosphate and 0.5 mg fast red violet LB salt per mL, in AMP buffer. Cells were incubated for 10 minutes 

at room temperature, washed with PBS and mounted (BiomedaCorporation, USA) for observation under 

the phase contrast microscope. 

For the 3-D in vitro studies (Chapter VIII), ALP staining the RBMSCs-HAp and -SPCL scaffold 

constructs were washed twice with PBS, after 14 days of culturing. Cells were fixed with 4% 

paraformaldehyde/Ca and Mg-free PBS solution for 15 minutes at 4ºC. The RBMSCs-scaffold construct 

specimens were washed twice with AMP buffer and then soaked with staining solution 0.5 mg naphtol 

AS-MX phosphate and 0.5 mg fast red violet LB salt per mL, in AMP buffer. RBMSCs-scaffold construct 

specimens were incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature, washed with Ca and Mg-free PBS 

solution and examined under a 3-D fluorescence microscope.  

5.8.4. Quantitative analysis of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 

GBMSCs osteoblastic differentiation was investigated by determining the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 

activity (Chapter V). GBMSCs-HAp scaffold constructs used for DNA quantification assay were used to 

determine ALP levels. As cells were lysed during the above mentioned procedure, both DNA and other 

proteins produced by the cells were in suspension in the supernatant solution. So, to each well of a    

96-well plate were added 20 µL of sample plus 60 µL of substrate solution consisting of 0.2% (w/v)      

p-nytrophenyl phosphate in a substrate buffer: 1 M diethanolamine HCl (Merck, Germany), at pH 9.8. 

The plate was then incubated in the dark for 45 minutes at 37ºC. After the incubation period, 80 µL of a 

stop solution (2 M NaOH containing 0.2 mM EDTA) was added to each well. Standards were prepared 

with 10 µmol.mL-1 p-nytrophenol, pNP and the stop solutions in order to achieve the final concentrations 

ranging between 0 and 0.3 µmol.mL-1. Triplicates were made for each sample and standard. 

Absorbance was read at 405 nm and sample concentrations were read off from standard graph.  

In a different study (Chapter VI), ALP was also measured to evaluate osteoblast differentiation of 

RBMSCs cultured in the presence of Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. The 

samples used for DNA quantification assay were used to determine ALP levels. Prior to analysis the 

samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 1 minute at 4?C. To each well of a 96-well plate was added 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods  

 
 
- 124 - 
 

an aliquot of supernatant and p-nytrophenyl phosphate substrate (ZYMED® Laboratories, Invitrogen, 

USA). The plate was then incubated in the dark for 30 minutes at 37ºC. After the incubation period, the 

reaction was stopped with 1 M NaOH. Standards were prepared with pNP. Triplicates were made for 

each sample and standard. Absorbance was read at 405 nm (Wallac ARVOsx 1420, Perkin-Elmer Life 

and Analytical Sciences, USA), and sample concentrations were read off from the standard graph. 

Enzyme activity was expressed either as nmol of pNP released/well/30 minutes and normalized by DNA 

content. 

For quantification of ALP activity in 3-D systems (Chapter VIII), i.e. RBMSCs-HAp and RBMSCs-SPCL 

scaffolds, the remaining sonicated suspensions obtained from the DNA quantification assay were used. 

Prior to analysis the samples were sonicated once and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 1 minute at 4?C. 

To each well of a 96-well plate was added an aliquot of supernatant and p-nytrophenyl phosphate 

substrate (ZYMED® Laboratories, Invitrogen, USA), was added following the method described 

elsewhere [60] with minor modifications. Enzyme activity was determined as described above, expressed 

as nmol of pNP released/scaffold/30 minutes and normalized by DNA content. 

5.8.5. Immunocytochemistry 

Immunocytochemistry technique was used for evaluating the GBMSCs osteogenic differentiation after 

culturing onto the surface of the HAp scaffolds (Chapter V). GBMSCs-HAp scaffold constructs in an 

Accustain formalin solution, 10% neutral buffered for 1 hour at 4ºC, washing with PBS and including the 

constructs into methacrylate blocks. These blocks were cut into 10 ?m thick slides and kept overnight at 

80ºC before being used for subsequent immunocytochemistry analysis. The procedures 

immunocytochemistry were carried out following the instructions included in commercial kit: the RTU 

Vector Stain kit – Universal Elite ABC kit PK7200 (Vector Laboratories Inc., USA). This kit was used 

with a Peroxidase Substract Kit – DAB SK4100 (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, USA). For this 

study, samples were incubated with collagen type I (1/100, Chemicon, USA) for 1.6 hours and the 

biotinylated secondary antibody was incubated for 1 hour prior to wash and incubate the constructs with 

DAB for about 6 minutes. Also an osteopontin antibody (1/100, rabbit polyclonal to osteopontin, Abcam, 

UK) was tested using slides from the same constructs. Although in this particular case, a fluorescent 

secondary antibody was used instead of a biotinylated one and kept overnight at 80ºC. The 

methacrylate sections were incubated with osteopontin antibody, washed and then Alexa Fluor 488 

secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, UK) was added to GBMSCs-HAp scaffold constructs. 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods  

 
 

- 125 - 
 

The incubation periods used were the same for both collagen type I and osteopontin antibodies. The 

observation of the constructs was performed using an Axio Imager Z1 microscope (Zeiss, Germany). 

5.8.6. Osteocalcin content determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 

Osteocalcin content was also determined to evaluate osteoblast differentiation of RBMSCs cultured in 

the presence of Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles (2-D system, Chapter VI). The 

samples used for ALP activity were treated with a 20% formic acid solution immediately after concluding 

the assay and stored at 4?C for 2-3 days. Then, samples were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes 

at 4?C and the supernatant passed through a SephadexTM G-25 column (GE healthcare, Sweden) for 

desalting. The filtered samples were concentrated in a SPD SpeedVac® equipment attached to a UV 

Vacuum System (Thermo Electron Corporation, USA), prior to osteocalcin quantification. Finally, the 

osteocalcin content was determined by performing an Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and using 

a Rat Osteocalcin EIA kit (N? BT-460, Biomedical Technologies Inc., USA). The experimental procedure 

was carried out following the instructions provided by the supplier. A 100 ng.mL-1 standard solution of 

human osteocalcin was used to construct the standard curve. Data was read off from the standard 

graph and expressed as ng of deposited osteocalcin per ?g of DNA. 

For quantification of osteocalcin content in the 3-D systems (Chapter VIII), i.e. RBMSCs/HAp and 

RBMSCs/SPCL scaffolds, the remnants of each sample used for the ALP/DNA assays were treated with 

a 20% formic acid solution and stored at 4?C for 2-3 days. After that time, samples were centrifuged at 

15,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4?C. The supernatant was passed through a SephadexTM G-25 column 

(GE healthcare, Sweden) for de-salting, and concentrated in order to carry out the ELISA assay. A Rat 

Osteocalcin EIA kit (N? BT-460, Biomedical Technologies Inc., MA, USA) was also used following the 

instructions provided by the supplier. Once, data was read off from the standard curve obtained with 

human osteocalcin and expressed as ng of deposited osteocalcin per ?g of DNA. 

5.9. IN VITRO CHONDROGENIC DIFFERENTIATION STUDIES 

5.9.1. Quantification of glucosaminoglycans (GAGs) 

GBMSCs chondrogenic differentiation onto the surface of CHT scaffold constructs was also investigated 

(Chapter V). Glucosaminoglycans (GAGs) quantification assay [69] was used to determine extracellular 

chondrogenic matrix formation after day 7, day 21 and day 28 of chondrogenic medium culture. 

GBMSCs-CHT scaffold constructs used for this assay were the same used for ALP and DNA assays. 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods  

 
 
- 126 - 
 

GAGs standards were obtained by preparing a chondroitin sulphate solution ranging from 0 and           

30 µg.mL-1. In each well of a 96-well plate, 20 µL of sample or standard were added in triplicates and 

then 250 µL per well of dimethylmethylene blue (DMB) was added and mixed. The optical density was 

measured immediately at 525 nm on a microplate ELISA reader. A standard curve was created and 

GAGs sample values were read off from the standard graph.

For the in vivo studies, RBMSCs were expanded in different culture media namely, MEM, MEM 

supplemented with Dex and MEM supplemented with the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles. Then, the respective RBMSCs at different cell numbers (1 x 106 and 2 x 105) were 

seeded onto the surface of the HAp and SPCL scaffolds, cultured overnight for cell adhesion and then 

constructs were implanted subcutaneously and retrieved after 2 and 4 week of implantation (Figure 8). 

HAp and SPCL scaffolds without RBMSCs were also implanted (controls).

6.2. SURGICAL PROCEDURE 

Seven-week-old male Fischer 344 rat (Syngeneic F344/N rat), same as donor sub-strain and age, were 

anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (Nembutal, Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.,

Japan) at a final concentration of 3.5 mg per 100 g of body weight. The hair of the rat was cut at the 

implantation area, followed by washing with tap water and scrubbed with tincture of iodine and 70% 

ethanol. In each rat, three or four skin incisions (each 1 cm length) on the dorsal midline below the ear 

were made. Each RBMSCs-HAp and -SPCL constructs was implanted subcutaneously (1.5 to 2 cm 

away from the midline at both right and left sides) into the respective pocket and skin sutured. As a 

negative control, we used HAp and SPCL implants without RBMSCs. No prophylactic medication was 

administered post-surgery. After 2 and 4 weeks implantation, the animals were sacrificed with an 

overdose of anesthetic and RBMSCs-HAp and -SPCL constructs and controls were retrieved from the 

back of the F344/N rats. All experiments were carried out 3 times. 

6.3. EXPLANTS CHARACTERIZATION 

6.3.1. Micro-computed tomography (µ-CT) and morphometric analyses  

New bone formation in the retrieved implants or explants was investigated by micro-computed 

tomography analysis (?-CT: MCT-CB 100MF(Z); Hitachi Medical Corp., Tokyo, Japan). After 2 and 4 

weeks of implantation, construct were retrieved, rinsed with PBS, and fixed with 10% formalin at room 

temperature, overnight. For the HAp-based constructs (Chapter IX), the explants were placed on the flat 

surface for analysis under the ?-CT. X-ray scans were acquired with a resolution mode of 10 µm (x/y/z) 

at 50 kV and 150 ?A. The analytical conditions were: precision mode, 7 times magnification with an 

image intensifier field of 4.57 cm [70]. CT reconstruction has carried out using the 3D Bone Morphometry 

(TRI/3D-Bon, RATOC System Engineering Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) software for evaluate the 2-D 

distribution of newly formed bone within the pores of the implanted constructs. Morphometric analysis 

was carried out using the public domain image-processing program IMAGE J (National Institutes of 

Health, Bethesda, MD) to obtain quantitative evaluation of histological section of bone. The light 

microscopy photographs of the 2-D histological decalcified sections of the HAp-based explants (Chapter 

IX) were converted to gray-value images and several filter steps were performed [71]. Shrinkage 

percentage observed in decalcified sections [70] was not considered in the calculations. New bone 

formation (NB) was expressed as a percentage of bone volume density (BV/TSV, Bone volume/Tissue 

plus Scaffold volume) ± standard deviation. A minimum of 12 sections per implant were analyzed. 

For the SPCL-based constructs (Chapter X), new bone formation in the explants was evaluated with a 

high-resolution µ-CT Skyscan 1072 scanner (Skyscan, Kontich, Belgium) and using a resolution of pixel 

size of 6.59 ?m and integration time of 1.7 ms. The X-ray source was set at 40 keV of energy and 250 

?A of current. Approximately 400 projections were acquired over a rotation range of 180° with a rotation

step of 0.45°. Data sets were reconstructed using standardized cone-beam reconstruction software 

(NRecon v1.4.3, SkyScan). The output format for each sample was 500 serial 1024x1024 bitmap 

images. Representative data sets of 250 slices were segmented into binary images with a dynamic 

threshold of 220-255 (grey values) to access the new bone formation in the explants. The same 

representative volume of interest (VOI) was analysed for all the samples. These data sets were used for 

morphometric analysis (CT Analyser, v1.5.1.5, SkyScan) and to build the 3-D models (ANT 3D creator, 

v2.4, SkyScan). The morphometric analysis included scaffold characterization such as porosity and 

interconnectivity, histograms and new bone formation quantification. The distribution of this new bone 

formation in the scaffolds was assessed by 3-D virtual models that were created, visualized and 

registered using both image processing software’s (CT Analyser and ANT 3D creator). 

6.3.2. Histological evaluation 

After ?-CT analyses, the explants were decalcified with K-CX solution (Falma Co., Tokyo, Japan) for 

histological analysis. Firstly, the explants were dehydrated in an ascending series grade ethanol/water 

solution (from 90-100%) using an automatic machine for 19 hours followed by washing three times with 

xylene. Secondly, specimens were immersed in paraffin at 62ºC and allowed to solidify at -5ºC. Slides 

were prepared by cutting the specimens into sections 5 ?m thick using a microtome, and mounted in a 

micro-slide glass (Matsunami glass Ind. Ltd., Japan). Then, paraffin was melt by placing the slides in the 

oven at 71ºC for 20 minutes and allowed to let cool down at room temperature. The remnant paraffin 

was then eliminated off in hexane for 5 minutes (S.T. Chemical, Japan), followed by dipping into a 

ethylene/propylene mixture (Clear Plus, Falma Co., Tokyo, Japan) for 3 minutes. Finally, slides were 

immersed three times in 100% ethanol for 2 minutes each time of immersion.   

6.3.2.1. Haematoxylin &amp;amp; Eosin (H&amp;amp;E) staining  

For the Haematoxylin &amp;amp; Eosin (H&amp;amp;E) staining, slides were sequentially transferred to a 90% ethanol and 

then to a 70% and washed with tap water. It followed the staining step, which consisted in the 

immersion of the slides into the GM’s Haematoxylin dye (Muto Pure Chemicals Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan, 

Nº 3008-1) for 10 minutes. It followed the washing step with tap water for 5 to 10 minutes. Then, slides 

were rinsed with de-ionized water and immersed in a 70% ethanol solution. Finally, slides were 

immersed in Eosin dye (Muto Pure Chemicals Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan, Nº 3204-2) solution for 2 minutes 

and dehydrated in a series of ethanol grades (70, 90, and 100%). At last, the specimens were immersed 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods  

 
 

- 129 - 
 

three times in an ethylene/propylene mixture and then mounted avoiding the formation of bubbles for 

observation. 

6.3.2.2. Toluidine blue staining 

For Toluidine blue staining, paraffin was melt and slides rinsed with ultrapure water. The ground 

sections were stained with 0.05% Toluidine blue (Muto Pure Chemicals Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) for 30 

minutes. Finally, the slides were dehydrated in a series of ethanol grades (70, 90, and 100%) and 

mounted for further observation. All slides were examined under a light microscope (Olympus DP70, 

Olympus Co. Ltd, Japan). 2-D histological sections were obtained for bone specimens used in the 

micro-tomography analysis. 

6.3.3. Quantification of ALP 

Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured to evaluate osteoblast differentiation, in vivo (Chapters IX 

and X). Prior to the assay, the explants were washed with Ca and Mg-free PBS solution. Then, implants 

were transferred to a 2 mL eppendorf and pulverized with zirconia’s balls as previously reported [61]. 

Prior to analysis the samples were sonicated and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 1 minute at 4?C. To 

each well of a 96-well plate was added an aliquot of supernatant and p-nytrophenyl phosphate substrate 

(ZYMED® Laboratories, Invitrogen, USA) [60]. The plate was then incubated in the dark for 30 minutes at 

37ºC and after that time the reaction was stopped with 1 M NaOH (Panreac). Standards were prepared 

with pNP. Triplicates were made for each sample and standard. Absorbance was read at 405 nm 

(Wallac ARVOsx 1420, Perkin-Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, USA), and sample concentrations 

were read off from the standard graph. Enzyme activity was expressed either as nmol of pNP 

released/explant/30 minutes. 

6.3.4. Quantification of osteocalcin 

The remnant of each sample used for the ALP assay of the explants, was treated with a 20% formic 

acid solution and stored at 4?C for 2-3 days (Chapters IX and X). Afterwards samples were centrifuged 

at 15,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4?C. Then, the supernatant was passed through a SephadexTM G-25 

column (GE healthcare, Sweden), subsequently concentrated for performing the Enzyme-linked 

immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A Rat Osteocalcin EIA kit (N? BT-460, Biomedical Technologies Inc., 

MA, USA) was used following the instructions provided by the supplier. Data was read off from the 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods  

 
 
- 130 - 
 

standard curve obtained with human osteocalcin and expressed as ng of deposited osteocalcin per 

explant. 

6.3.5. Calcium assay 

As an index of mineral bone formation, deposited calcium in the SPCL-based explants (Chapter X) was 

quantified as described by Kim et al. [72,73], with minor modifications. Briefly, SPCL-based explants were 

rinsed with Ca and Mg-free PBS solution and 0.2 mL of 1N HCl per explants was added.  The tissues 

were chopped before being placed on an orbital shaker to extract calcium for 12 hours. Then, mixtures 

were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 minutes and supernatants were assayed using a commercial 

calcium assay kit (Calcium C-test™, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Japan) and following the 

instructions provided by the supplier. 

7. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  

Statistical evaluation was performed using one way ANOVA (internalization times experiments) and two-

tailed paired t-student tests (MTS, total protein, comparison between renovation and non-renovation of 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles in the culture media), to assess the statistical differences 

between different groups. Statistical significance was defined as p&lt;0.05 for a 95% confidence interval.  

Results of in vitro cytotoxicity screening of the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were also 

analyzed for statistical significance using Student’s t-test with the JMP 5.0.1 software (SAS Institute, 

Cary, N.C.).

Novel hydroxylapatite/carboxymethylchitosan composite scaffolds prepared combining an 

innovative ‘autocatalytic’ electroless co-precipitation route 

Abstract 

A developmental composite scaffold for bone tissue engineering applications composed of 

hydroxylapatite (HAp) and carboxymethylchitosan (CMCht) was obtained using a co-precipitation 

method, which is based on the “autocatalytic” electroless deposition route. The obtained results 

revealed that the pores of the scaffold were regular, interconnected and possess a size comprised in the 

range of 20 to 500 ?m. Furthermore, the Fourier-transform infra-red spectrum of the composite 

scaffolds exhibited all the characteristic peaks of apatite, and the appearing of typical bands from 

CMCht, thus showing that co-precipitation of both organic and inorganic phases was effective. The      

X-ray diffraction pattern of composite scaffolds demonstrated that calcium-phosphates consisted of 

crystalline HAp. From micro-computed tomography analysis, it was possible to determine that 

composite scaffolds possess a 58.9 ± 6% of porosity. Moreover, the 2-D morphometric analysis 

demonstrated that in average the scaffolds consisted of 24% HAp and 76% CMCht. The mechanical 

properties were assessed using compressive tests, both in dry and wet states. Additionally, in vitro tests 

were carried out to evaluate the water-uptake capability, weight loss and bioactive behaviour of the 

composite scaffolds. The novel hydroxylapatite/carboxymethylchitosan composite scaffolds show to be 

promising whenever degradability and bioactivity are simultaneously desired, such as in the case of 

bone tissue engineering scaffolding applications.

1. INTRODUCTION 

The innovative Tissue Engineering (TE) concepts promises the creation of viable substitutes for the 

repair, replacement or regeneration of organs and tissues, and by this mean allowing a wide range of 

novel therapeutical possibilities [1]. This area of expertise deals with three main strategies: (i) combining 

of living cells with specially designed biomaterials [2,3], (ii) use of cells isolated or cells substitutes [4-6], 

and (iii) targeted-delivery of bioactive molecules, such as growth and differentiation factors by means of 

using drug-delivery carriers [7-9].  

Scaffold technologies play a central role on the field of TE, since the main aim of the scaffold is to act as 

a support and guidance template for the development of a new tissue, both in vitro and in vivo [10]. 

Therefore, the size of the channels or pores as well as the 3-D architecture has a great effect on the cell 

seeding, infiltration and consequently on the tissue regeneration [11-13]. For instances, when engineering 

bone tissue, the scaffolds should meet other important criteria. It must be biocompatible [14], 

biodegradable in an appropriate time window, its degradation products should be non-toxic and easily 

eliminated by the metabolic pathways, support cell adhesion and growth, and possess adequate 

mechanical stability [1,10,15-18]. Moreover, the material should induce bone formation (osteoinductive) in 

addition to allow new bone ingrowths (osteoconductive) [19], while facilitating the angiogenesis [1,10] to 

supply with nutrients the newly formed tissue.  

In recent years, great efforts have been made towards the development of new synthetic skeletal 

substitute products [20-22]. Among these, bioceramics and polymeric scaffolds have attracted much 

attention, such as hydroxylapatite (HAp, Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) [23,24]  and chitosan [25,26], respectively. 

Although, since there is not yet a single material that fulfils all the necessary requirements for bone 

tissue engineering scaffolds [27] composites have been developed [27-34]. Mechanical properties is one of 

the great advantages of composites, i.e. usually show a good balance between strength and toughness 

[17], but their improved osteoconductivity and biodegradability are also interesting [33]. From this point of 

view, composites materials are a better choice for such type of applications [35,18]. Bearing these 

premises in mind, Reis et al. [36] have been focusing its efforts at create innovative TE composite 

scaffolds based on natural-derived polymers and ceramics.  

Carboxymethylchitosan (CMCht) is a biocompatible and biodegradable chitin or chitosan-derivative 

polymer [37] There are several types of carboxymethylated chitosans, which can be prepared through 

different methods [38,39] Of particular interest is the fact that contrarily to chitin and chitosan, CMCht is a 

water-soluble polymer [38,40]. Its versatility allowed many applications, namely as metal ion chelating 

agents [40,41], drug delivery [42,43], and medicine [44].

electroless co-precipitation route

Muzzarelli et al. [38] reported that chitosan do not bind significantly calcium ions. On the contrary CMCht 

adsorb calcium ions to an extent that is dependent on proportion of protonation or if the molecule is in 

salt form of sodium. In this report an important particularity of CMCht was demonstrated. By attracting 

the calcium ions it is expected that one can have an effect on the precipitation of biominerals [45], or on 

the growth of the crystals either in vitro and in vivo [46,47]. 

Herein it is reported a co-precipitation route for the preparation of 

hydroxylapatite/carboxymethylchitosan (HAp/CMCht) composite materials. This method is based on a 

previously reported “autocatalytic” electroless bath [48,49] that has been used in our group to modify the 

surface of bioinert and biodegradable polymers (Figure 1) [49] This methodology is based on the 

possibility of chemisorption of Palladium (Pd2+) on the surface of bioinert polymers (1), which acts as the 

catalyst to induce the precipitation of calcium-phosphate on its surface (2) [50-53]. Since it is known that 

CMCht is able to chelate metal ions [40], we expect CMCht to bind Pd2+. As illustrated in Figure 1 the 

resulting excess of positive charge from the CMCht/Pd2+ complex may build up an adjacent layer of 

negative charges (phosphate groups), which can originate a residual charge responsible for attracting 

other calcium ions. Consequently, calcium phosphate precipitation may occur on the presence of 

CMCht due to a local supersaturation followed by calcium phosphate nucleation [32]. In this context, we 

hypothesized that by means of using an acidic “autocatalytic” electroless bath it may became possible to 

occur the co-precipitation of calcium-phosphates and CMCht. 

As previously highlighted the porosity of scaffolds greatly dictates the performance of a 3-D template in 

the TE approaches.Therefore, the development of novel processing routes towards the fabrication of 

adequate porous structures is of great interest. The novelty of this work consists on the possibility of 

tailoring the porosity and 3-D architecture of the composite materials by means of using a wax spheres 

leaching methodology. The physicochemical characterization of composite scaffolds was performed by 

X-ray diffraction analysis, Fourier-transform infra-red spectroscopy, micro-computed tomography, and 

scanning electron microscopy attached with an X-ray detector. Complementarily, mechanical properties 

of composite scaffolds were determined under compression testing, in dry and wet states. 

In vitro tests were carried out to assess the swelling and weight loss behaviour. The bioactive character 

of the composite scaffolds was also investigated by means of soaking the composite scaffolds in a 

simulated body fluid (SBF) solution. The elemental composition in the SBF solution was monitored by 

inductively-coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry.

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  

2.1. MATERIALS 

Reagent grade chitosan particles with a deacetylation degree of ~91% and size in the range of   

125-250 ?m (Vanson, USA), monochloroacetic acid (Sigma, USA), acetic acid (Fluka, Switzerland), 

sodium hydroxide 40% (Merck, Germany) solution, and acetone (Pronalab, Portugal) were used in 

the preparation of carboxymethylchitosan (CMCht).  

Calcium chloride, CaCl2 (Merck, Germany), ortho-phosphoric acid, H3PO4 (Panreac, Spain) and 

palladium chloride, PdCl2 (Aldrich, USA) were used to prepare the acidic “autocatalytic” electroless 

bath, and ammonium hydroxide 33%, NH4OH (Riedel-de Haën, Germany) solution to adjust the pH 

of the co-precipitation media. 

Hydration and weight loss tests were performed using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) tablets 

supplied by Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany).  

The Simulated Body Fluid (SBF) solution was prepared as previously reported by Kokubo et al. [54]. 

Potassium bromide, KBr (Riedel-de Haën, Germany) suitable for spectroscopy was used to prepare 

de FTIR pellets.  

2.2. PREPARATION OF THE COMPOSITE SCAFFOLDS 

CMCht was prepared by a modification of the reaction process that has been previously reported by 

Chen et al. [55] The composite materials were prepared by a co-precipitation method using a acidic 

“autocatalytic” electroless bath [48]. The acidic electroless bath was prepared by dissolving calcium 

chloride with a final concentration of 5.6 g.L-1, ortho-phosphoric acid 3.4 g.L-1, and palladium chloride 

0.9 g.L-1 in 500 ml distilled water, under agitation. A 10 wt% CMCht aqueous solution was added to the 

bath using a peristaltic pump (Gilson Miniplus 3, France) at a speed rate 2 mL.minute-1. The composite 

precipitate was obtained by means of adjusting the pH of the bath to 6 with ammonium hydroxide. The 

precipitate was filtered under vacuum and the excess of water removed by drying at 37ºC for 24 hours. 

Porous structures were prepared by means of mixing the composite filtrate and 20 wt% wax spheres 

(Desert Whale Jojoba Company, Inc., USA), with a diameter ranging from 50-450 ?m, and transferring 

into a cylindrical mould with 4-7 mm diameter and 8-22 mm height. After drying at 60ºC, the wax 

spheres were eliminated off by soaking into tetrahydrofuran (Riedel-de Haën, Germany), in an 

ultrasound bath, for several hours. Once composite scaffolds were allowed to dry until constant weight

and the scaffolds freeze at -80ºC overnight, followed by freeze-drying for the period of 2 days to 

completely remove the organic solvent. 

2.3. SWELLING AND WEIGHT LOSS STUDIES 

Water-uptake or swelling and weight loss of the developed composite scaffolds were performed, by 

soaking into a PBS solution for times up to 30 days, in triplicate. The solution was prepared by 

dissolving 1 tablet of PBS in 200 mL of distilled water to obtain a final concentration of 0.0027 M 

potassium chloride and 0.137 M sodium chloride, pH 7.4 at 25ºC. The water-uptake was 

determined by the changes on the initial mass of the scaffolds (mi) after incubation in the PBS 

solution at 37 ? 1ºC. The scaffolds were removed after 1, 3, 7, 15, 21 and 30 days of immersion, 

the excess of solution removed out with a filter paper, and the mass (mw) determined using an 

analytical balance. Then, scaffolds were dried at 60ºC until constant weight, the mass determined 

(md) in order to obtain the weight loss. The percentage of water-uptake of scaffolds (WUs) after 

each time of immersion (t) was calculated by means of using equation (1), 

 

 

The percentage of weight loss of the scaffolds (WLs) after each time of immersion (t) was 

calculated using equation (2), 

 

 

2.4. BIOACTIVITY TEST 

Bioactivity tests were performed by soaking the scaffolds in a simulated body fluid (SBF) solution at 

37 ? 1ºC. This solution contains the inorganic ion concentrations resembling to those found in 

human blood plasma and pH of 7.4 [54] for periods of time ranging from 1 to 30 days. After each 

soaking time the scaffolds were removed from the SBF solution and immediately rinsed with 

distilled water, dried at room temperature for 24 hours and in the oven at 60ºC until constant 

weight. The concentration of the Ca and P ions, after each soaking time, was measured by 

inductively-coupled plasma optical emission (ICP-OES, JY 70 plus, JobinYvon, France) 

spectrometry. Triplicate samples were analysed for each soaking time and an averaged result 

calculated.

2.5. MECHANICAL PROPERTIES 

Compression tests in dry state were performed using a Universal Testing Machine (Instron 4505) 

possessing a load cell of 50 kN. A minimum number of 10 composite scaffolds were tested after storage 

at ~20ºC and 55% relative humidity, to obtain an averaged result. Tests were conducted up to failure or 

until 60% reduction in specimen height as previously reported by Boesel et al. [56]. Complementarily, 

compression tests “Push-out” in wet state were carried out by means of using a Miniature Materials 

Tester (Minimat Vsn 3.1, Rheometric Scientific Ltd, UK). This equipment is capable of sensing full scale 

load ranges from 20 N up to 1000 N at 37ºC. Before conducting the tests, composite scaffolds were 

introduced inside the perforated stainless steel shells (6 mm of diameter and 11 mm height), and 

soaked into a PBS solution for 24 hours at 37ºC inside an oven. Afterwards, the shells containing the 

composite scaffolds were immersed into a PBS solution at 37ºC and a minimum number of 5 samples 

were tested. A baseline was also performed for each sample using the same experimental conditions 

but running the experiments with the empty stainless steel shells. 

2.6. SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY 

The microstructure of the composite scaffolds before and after immersion into the SBF solution was 

performed using scanning electron microscope, SEM (Leica Cambridge S-360, UK). Previously to 

the elemental and microstructure analysis, specimens were coated with carbon (Fisons 

Instruments, Polaron SC 508, UK) and gold (Fisons Instruments, Polaron SC 502, UK), 

respectively. The current was set at 18 mA with a coating time of 120 seconds. The phosphorus, 

calcium, sodium, carbon and oxygen elemental analysis was achieved by means of using an X-ray 

detector, EDS (Pentafet model 5526, UK) attached to the S-360 microscope, and a voltage of 10 

keV was used. 

2.7. FOURIER-TRANSFORM INFRA-RED SPECTROSCOPY 

Fourier-transform infra-red (FTIR) analysis was performed using a Perkin-Elmer spectroscope (Perkin-

Elmer 1600 series equipment). Transparent KBr pellets were prepared by mixing in the ratio of 1:10 of 

sample/KBr (wt/wt), and milling in an agate mortar, followed by uniaxially pressing the powders. All 

transmission spectra were recorded in the region of 4400-450 cm-1, using a minimum of 32 scans, and a 

2 cm-1 resolution.

2.8. X-RAY DIFFRACTION 

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis were performed on powder samples of CMCht and composite scaffolds, 

using an X-ray diffractometer with Cu-K? radiation at 50 mA and 40 kV (Philips PW 1710, The 

Netherlands). Using flat plate geometry, data were collected from 2 to 62º 2? values, with a step size of 

0.02º, and a counting time of 2 seconds.step-1. 

2.9. MICRO-COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY 

Micro-computed tomography (?-CT) of the composite scaffolds was carried out using a Scanco 20 

equipment (Scanco Medicals, Switzerland). Mimics® from Materialise (Belgium) was used as image 

processing software. The X-ray scans were performed in high resolution mode (9 µm) and 240 

slices of the materials were obtained. The 2-D histomorphometric analysis of the scaffolds was 

performed using a threshold 51 to identify the polymeric phase in order to determine the porosity, 

and a threshold 133 to identify the hydroxylapatite content along the scaffold (from 0-2000 ?m).

bioinert and biodegradable polymers with calcium-phosphates. 

3. RESULTS 

Figure 2 shows the SEM morphology and EDS analysis of the composite scaffolds. These results 

revealed that the pores of the scaffolds were regular with size comprised in the range of 20 to 500 ?m 

(Figure 2A). Additionally, it is possible to observe a typical interconnected macropores of size higher 

than 200 ?m (Figure 2B). At high magnification, it is possible to observe that CMCht (white arrow) co-

precipitated with ceramic particles (black arrow) (Figure 2C), and that these particles were

homogeneously distributed throughout the polymer network. Once, the EDS analysis corroborated 

previous studies showing that particles are calcium and phosphate in nature (Figure 2D).  

 

Figure 2. SEM micrographs of the hydroxylapatite/carboxymethylchitosan  

composite scaffolds: lateral view (A), typical pore (B), interface between the HAp and CMCht (C), and 

respective EDS (D). 

The FTIR spectra of chitosan and CMCht demonstrated that the late was successfully synthesized, 

as detected by the presence of characteristic absorption bands of the carboxyl group (?) at 1593 

cm-1 and 1417 cm-1 (?as COO- and ?s COO-) (Figures 3A-B). On the other hand, the FTIR 

spectrum of the composite scaffolds revealed the presence of two types of phosphate absorption 

bands, PO43- (?3) at 1190-1020 cm-1 (+), and the PO43- (?4) bands at 601 cm-1 and 565 cm-1 (x) 

(Figure 3C). Additionally, it was detected the presence of the peaks corresponding to the carbonate 

groups, namely at 875 cm-1 attributed to carbonate ?2 (?) and at 1650-1300 cm-1 assigned to 

carbonate ?3 (?), which can be indicative of the carbonate ion substitution. The appearing of a 

band (?) at 1417 cm-1 assigned to the COO- group, and at 1731 cm-1 (?) to COOH group, indicated 

that CMCht is present in the composite scaffold.

are shown in Figure 4A and 4B, respectively. The diffractogram of composite scaffolds 

demonstrated that the calcium-phosphates consisted of crystalline HAp (Figure 4A). Figure 4B 

shows that CMCht is essentially amorphous.

From ?-CT, it can be seen that the porosity of the scaffolds extends from the top to the bottom 

(black arrows), showing the high interconnectivity of the scaffolds (Figures 5A-B). On the other 

hand, the 2-D morphometric analysis demonstrated that in average the scaffolds consisted of 24% 

HAp and 76% CMCht (Figure 5C). Moreover, it was also possible to determine that the composite 

scaffolds possess 58.9 ± 6% of porosity.

until day 7 and after this period a slight stabilisation around the day 15 occur (Figure 6A). After this 

period of time, it is possible to observe a slight decrease of the water-uptake.  

 

Figure 6. Hydroxylapatite/carboxymethylchitosan composite scaffolds after soaking in PBS solution for 

times ranging from 1 up to 30 days: water-uptake (A) and weight loss (B). 

In respect to the weight loss, a decrease of 3.5% in mass can be seen around day 7. From day 7 

until day 15, it is possible to observe a dramatic increase in weight loss (~ 9% in mass). This trend 

was observed until day 30 (Figure 6B).The mechanical properties of the composite scaffolds was 

assessed using compression tests in dry state. A modulus (E) of 57.3 ± 7 MPa and maximum 

percentage strength of 51.0 ± 6 MPa was obtained. Additionally, it was also carried out studies in 

wet state by measuring the “push-out” force (Figure 7) after soaking the composite scaffolds into a 

PBS solution for the period of 24 hours. A modulus (E) of 0.5 ± 0.3 MPa was calculated by linear 

regression. 

The SEM studies revealed that deposition of aggregates occur after soaking 1d into a SBF solution 

(Figure 8A). From Figure 8B, it is possible to observe that the surface of the composite scaffolds 

was completely covered with a thick film with a typical apatite-like morphology, after 7 days.

4. DISCUSSION 

Previously, we demonstrate that carboxymethylchitosan (CMCht) can react with CaCl2 in two 

different “autocatalytic” electroless media containing Pd2+, namely the acid and oxidant baths, 

resulting in the formation of opaque dispersions [48]. By performing a potentiometric titration, it was 

possible to verify that CMCht precipitation occurred preferentially in the range of pH’s comprised 

between ~2-6 (data not shown). In the same report, we conclude that CMCht can co-precipitate 

with calcium-phosphates in a higher extent when using an acidic bath. This observation may be due 

to a more effective complexation of CMCht with Pd2+ ions. By this mean, we were able to produce a 

composite material, which is expected to possess improved mechanical and bioactive behaviour.  

In the present investigation, SEM studies have shown the existence of two phases on the 

composite scaffolds, i.e. an organic and the inorganic one (Figure 2C). The EDS analysis showed 

that the inorganic phase consisted of calcium and phosphorus (Figure 2D). Therefore, the 

precipitation of CMCht enclosed the calcium phosphate particles inside the polymer. Moreover, 

using a wax spheres leaching methodology it was possible to develop 3D-macroporous structures 

with tailored porosity and interconnectivity (Figures 2A-B). The average pore size was found to be

comprised between 20 to 500 ?m. Regarding materials porosity, Kaplan et al. [13] has been showing 

that the range of pore size observed in the composite scaffolds will be beneficial for the cells or 

tissue ingrowths, and formation of capillaries.  

It has been reported [57] that the chelation of Ca2+ by the water soluble CMCht involves both 

carboxymethyl group and the 3-OH of a neighboring residue. From these findings, it is expected 

that the efficiency of CMCht on the Pd2+/Ca2+ chelation would be dependent not only on the state of 

protonation of its carboxymethyl groups but also on the degree of substitution, i.e. percentage of 

carboxymethyl groups. Therefore, the degree of substitution of CMCht will dictate the number of 

chelation sites. These findings are extremely important because by either changing the pH of the 

precipitation bath and the initial degree of substituion of CMCht or even the molecular weight [58] we 

may be able to tailor the chemical composition of the composite scaffolds, i.e. the efficiency of 

calcium-phosphate co-precipitation, and ultimately its physicochemical properties.  

Another advantage of using CMCht on the development of composite scaffolds for bone tissue 

applications, arises from the fact that CMCht allows to incorporate a larger variety of molecules 

(e.g. bovine serum albumin or bone morphogenetic proteins, BMPs) from precipitating media. But 

more importantly, this can be done in a wider range of pH’s, which it is not possible when using 

chitosan, for example [59]. Therefore, we firmly believe that the herein proposed method is a 

feasible route to incorporate different pH-sensitive proteins in the bulk of the composite scaffolds 

without any detriment for its activity.  

Structural changes of chitosan and its derivatives were assessed by FTIR spectroscopy (Figure 3). 

The overlaid IR spectra show that CMCht has been successfully synthesized from chitosan. In the 

region of 3600-3000 cm-1 the chitosan, CMCht and composite scaffolds exhibit a highly convoluted 

IR band due to the various OH stretching contributions. The presence of characteristic absorption 

bands assigned to the asymmetric (as) and symmetric(s) stretching modes COO- group at        

1593 cm-1 and 1417 cm-1 revealed that carboxymethylation was effective (Figures 3A-B). Previous 

studies have shown that CMCht possess a substitution degree (DS) of 47% (data not shown). By its 

turn, the FTIR spectrum of the composite scaffolds exhibited all the characteristic peaks of apatite, 

i.e. the presence of phosphate absorption bands, PO43- (?3) at 1190-1020 cm-1, and the PO43- (?4) 

bands at 601 cm-1 and 565 cm-1 (Figure 3C). In the composite material, the appearing of a small 

band at 1417 cm-1 attributed to the carboxylic band, indicate that CMCht is also present. Besides, 

the band observed at 1731 cm-1 is also attributed to the –COOH group from CMCht. Additionally, it 

was also detected the peaks corresponding to the carbonate groups, namely at 875 cm-1 attributed

to carbonate ?2 and at 1650-1300 cm-1 assigned to carbonate ?3, which can be indicative of the 

carbonate ion substitution. The presence of the carbonate ?2 and ?3 vibrational modes, in the 

apatites may contribute to decrease the hydroxyl band, as seen in the FTIR spectra. It is known 

that the ?2 sites occur competitively between the OH- and carbonate groups at the interface of 

growing crystal, whereas the ?3 sites depends on the competition between phosphate and 

carbonate ions.  

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted to investigate the phase content and 

cristallinity of the developed composite scaffolds. The XRD pattern of the composite scaffolds, 

clearly demonstrated that the calcium phosphates peaks perfectly matched with the standard file for 

HAp (JCPDS 9-432; Figure 4A). The wide peak appearing approximately at 22º was assigned to 

CMCht (Figure 4B). Therefore, the carbonate ions detected by FTIR are assigned to surface ones, 

rather than to carbonate ions in the lattice of phosphate ions. It is also possible to detect the 

presence of halide in the composite scaffolds, which can be due to the possibility of chemisorption 

of Pd2+ on the surface CMCht, as initially hypothesized. Therefore this data is an indication that 

CMCht is able to bind Pd2+, which by its turn may promote the calcium phosphate precipitation. 

Besides being possible to control the CMCht precipitation, these results seems to corroborate 

previously reported ones, that showed that certain acidic “autocatalytic” electroless bath allows to 

control the Ca and P composition of composite, and the cristallinity of the inorganic phase [53]. 

By means of performing the ?-CT analysis of the novel composite scaffolds we were able to 

evaluate the porosity, both qualitative and quantitatively (Figure 5). Composite scaffolds showed to 

possess a high pore interconnectivity. Applying a threshold 133 (T133), it was possible to 

determine that in average the scaffolds consisted of 24% HAp and 76% CMCht. By its turn, when 

using the threshold 51 (T51), it was possible to calculate the porosity across the composite 

scaffolds. This study has shown that composite scaffolds have a porosity of 58.9 ± 6%, in average. 

Moreover, it is also possible to observe that porosity decreases where the HAp content increases. 

The reason for this observation and for the high interval of porosity may be due to the 

sedimentation of the HAp particles and wax spheres during the drying process. This can be 

prevented by agitating the moulds during the preparation of the composite scaffolds. From these 

results, it can be seen that the developed composite scaffolds have an appropriate porosity to find 

applications as bone substitutes. The method herein proposed presents and important advantage. 

Porosity and interconnectivity may be easily tailored by means of varying the content and 

granulometry of wax spheres.

Biodegradability or bioadsorbability [60] of the 3-D substrate is also an essential characteristic in TE 

applications. Since CMCht is a water soluble polymer we carried out in vitro tests, to determine the 

water-uptake capability (swelling) and weight loss of the developed composite scaffolds. The 

swelling profile showed a dramatic absorption of water (480%), from first hours until day 7. This 

swelling behaviour is often characteristic of a hydrogel. Nevertheless, it has been reported that 

CMCht swelling is dependent on the pH of the media [43]. Because CMCht contains both carboxyl 

and amino groups, it is possible to control the swelling of the composite scaffolds to load them with 

different proteins at different extents, for example. In fact, it has been reported that CMCht swell at 

low pH (&lt;2.0) and at pH in the range of 4.0-13.0 due to the protonated amino groups and 

unprotonated carboxyl groups, respectively [43]. Therefore, the swelling behaviour of CMCht is 

affected by both degree of deacetylation and degree of substitution. Additionally, the charge of the 

composite scaffolds can be altered due to the possibility of CMCht to bind Ca2+ or Pd2+, thus their 

swelling behavior is expected to be different from the typical CMCht gels.  

In respect to the weight loss it was possible to observe that composite scaffolds were stable until 

day 7. After 30 days, a dramatic weight loss occur (~11% in mass). These results are in agreement 

with previous reported ones [43] and can be explained due to the water soluble behaviour of CMCht. 

Moreover, the slight decrease on the swelling of the composite scaffolds after day 15 until day 30 

may be a consequence of this dissolution behaviour. Chen et al. [43] reported that 

carboxymethylchitin lose above 80% in weight after 20 days of immersion into a phosphate buffer at 

pH 7.4. Therefore, the lower weight loss of the novel composite scaffolds suggests that this trend 

may be a consequence of Ca2+ or Pd2+ ions chelation, thus resulting in the development of scaffolds 

more resistant to dissolution. In this context, future work will be carried out to evaluate the effect of 

Ca2+ or Pd2+ binding on the CMCht swelling and dissolution behaviour. A well known strategy to 

control the swelling of the polymers consists in performing the cross-linking [61]. In this context, after 

co-precipitation of CMCht and hydroxylapatite one may use cross-linking agents, such as silane-

coupling agents. This strategy may allow controlling the swelling and pH-sensitivity of the 

composite scaffolds, and to improve the stability of the organic-inorganic network. 

The mechanical properties of the composite scaffolds was assessed using compression tests in dry 

state. A modulus of 57.3 ± 7 MPa and maximum percentage strength of 51.0 ± 6 MPa at ~59% of 

macroporosity was obtained. Due to the high water-uptake capability of the composite scaffolds, its 

mechanical properties decrease dramatically after soaking into a PBS solution for 24 hours. Whilst 

mechanical strength of the composite scaffolds decreased after soaking into PBS solution, the

ductibility increased. These tests were carried out in confined cavities to mimic as much as possible 

the in vivo circumstances, i.e. at the implantation site the scaffold will be constrained by the bone 

compression. Interestingly, after undergoing the mechanical solicitation, the composite scaffolds 

showed a sponge-like behaviour, i.e. were capable of recover the initial shape without fracturing, 

thus keeping the scaffolds integrity. Based on these findings, the moldability of the composite 

scaffolds can be a major advantage if we take in consideration that the current orthopaedic implant 

materials such as sintered HAp are used in a hard form, thus requiring the surgeon to fit the 

surgical site around the implant or the need of a material of a desired shape [30].  

Other important parameters have to be taken in consideration when developing a TE scaffold. 

Besides other things the scaffold must be capable of drug loading and its release in a controlled 

manner. In this context, Chen et al. [43] have described a reliable methodology to load CMCht based 

polyampholyte hydrogels with drugs by taking advantage of the high swelling behaviour. Due to 

composite scaffolds both mechanical stability in wet state and ability to form hydrogels, the authors 

believe that the herein described composite scaffolds have great advantage over other materials, 

namely because possess a lower dissolution behaviour when compared with CMCht alone. 

In this study, bioactivty tests were also carried out. These have shown that deposition of apatite 

occur after soaking 1 day in a SBF solution. A thick film covering the surface of the composite 

scaffolds was observed after 7 days. This bioactive behaviour may be explained by the presence of 

HAp in the composite scaffold, which is known to accelerate the formation of bone-like apatite on 

the surface of implants [62]. The variation on calcium and phosphorus ion in SBF solution was 

monitored by ICP. From Figure 9 it can be seen that both calcium and phosphorus concentration 

decreased from day 1 until day 15. This trend may be a consequence of the consumption of both 

calcium and phosphorus during the precipitation of the apatite layer on the surface of the composite 

scaffolds (Figure 8). The increase of the Ca concentration (from day 15 until day 21) may be a 

result of CMCht dissolution. Moreover, since phosphate concentration remained constant, the 

release of calcium into the SBF solution can only be explained due to the release of calcium 

chelated to CMCht, and not due to a redissolution phenomena. Thus, this result is in agreement 

with the weight loss profile. Despite, further complimentary studies are required to elucidate the fast 

decrease of calcium and phosphorus in the SBF solution.

5. CONCLUSIONS 

This work demonstrated that it is possible to prepare hydroxylapatite/carboxymethylchitosan 

composite scaffolds by means of combining a novel acidic “autocatalytic” co-precipitation route and 

a novel wax spheres leaching methodology. The physicochemical properties of the composite 

scaffolds may be tailored, especially the 3-D architecture, content in organic-inorganic phases, and 

dissolution behaviour. Therefore, these composite scaffolds are very promising whenever 

degradability and bioactivity are simultaneously desired, such as in the case of bone tissue 

engineering scaffolding applications. Moreover, the novel composite scaffolds can possibly the 

incorporation of pH-sensitive proteins up to physiological pH, which is known to be one major 

drawback of chitosan materials for such type of applications. Future work will be performed to study 

of cell adhesion, proliferation and screen the citotoxicity on the surface of the novel 

hydroxylapatite/carboxymethylchitosan composite scaffolds.

Macroporous hydroxylapatite scaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications: 

physicochemical characterization and assessment of rat bone marrow stromal cell viability 

Abstract 

In this work, it is reported a new methodology for developing hydroxyapatite (HAp) scaffolds by using an 

organic sacrifice template. The novelty of work consists on the possibility of obtaining porous and highly 

interconnected scaffolds mimicking the sacrificial component. Our purpose consisted on evaluating the 

physicochemical properties of the HAp scaffolds by means of Fourier-transform infra-red spectroscopy, 

X-ray diffraction analysis, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) attached with an X-ray detector. The 

HAp scaffolds obtained possess a porosity of ~70%, and macropores diameter in the range of 50-600 

?m. On the other hand, results regarding the micro-computed tomography analysis have demonstrated 

both high pore uniformity and interconnectivity across the scaffolds. The compressive strength of the 

HAp scaffolds was found to be 30.2 ? 6.0 MPa. Bioactivity of the HAp scaffolds was assessed by 

immersion into a simulated body fluid solution, in vitro. SEM observations have showed a deposition of 

apatite on the surface of the HAp scaffolds, with a ‘cauliflower-like’ morphology after 1 day, and tend to 

be more pronounced with the immersion time. The changes in calcium and phosphorus concentration 

were monitored by inductively-coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. Cytotoxicity of the HAp 

scaffolds was preliminarily investigated by carrying direct observation of mouse fibroblasts cells (L929 

cell-line) death in the inverted microscope and then cell viability was determined by means of carrying 

out a MTS assay. Complementarily, a luminescent cell viability assay based on the quantification of 

adenosine triphosphate was performed using rat bone marrow stromal cells (RBMSCs). A LIVE/DEAD 

assay and SEM analysis allowed the visualization of the RBMSCs adhesion and proliferation on the 

surface of the HAp scaffolds. According to the results obtained from 3-D architecture, mechanical 

properties, biocompatibility and adhesion tests, it is suggested that HAp scaffolds has potential to find 

applications in bone tissue engineering scaffolding.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Bone lesions above a critical-sized segmental defect still remain a huge challenge to reconstructive 

surgery and regenerative medicine. This is mainly due to the fact that bone has a limited ability to heal 

[1,2]. In many clinical situations there is the need for a surgical intervention and the use of autografts [3,4], 

allografts or xenografts [4,5] transplantation. Still, the preferred clinical strategy is the autologous 

transplantation, since avoids the problem of immune rejection [6] and the consequent administration of 

drugs for immunosupression of the host [7]. Bone autografts consists on bone portions either cancellous 

or cortical [4], harvested from other skeletal locations, which are then transferred into the defect area that 

is aimed to repair [8]. Although, the limited bone graft volume available, consequent donor site morbidity 

[5,9] and post-operative pain [10] are seen as the major constraint in using autografts. Therefore, we can 

say that the currently available treatment possibilities are far from being a truly ideal solution. To 

circumvent these limitations great efforts are focused on developing implantable materials either 

synthetic and natural-based to be used as implants [11-13]. For instances, synthetic materials based on 

hydroxylapatite (HAp), Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, have demonstrated a great potential for being used as bone 

substitutes [13-15] or fracture repair devices [16]. The great interest in using HAp or other ceramic materials 

arises from the possibility to improve the clinical outcome due to their osteoconductive behaviour [14,17]. 

However, these biomaterials alone are not always as effective as bone autografts, since they lack the 

osteogenic and osteoinductive properties [18,19].  

More recently, it has been reported that by applying the tissue engineering (TE) principles [10], i.e. by 

seeding bone marrow stem cells into scaffolds, the so-called constructs [20] or prostheses [21] it was 

possible to recreate an regenerative environment at the defect area, which resulted in a more 

favourable healing. Despite the important advances, a wide range of problems related with the tissue 

engineering approaches remains unsolved. For example, many bone tissue engineering constructs 

developed showed that bone formation in vitro, only occurred at the surface [22]. Therefore, it seems that 

much has to be done and improvements of the cell culture techniques [23] and appropriate scaffolds 

architecture are needed for developing successful constructs that can be used in the clinical practice. 

Therefore, there is the need for continuously improving the development of processing routes towards 

the fabrication of biocompatible with adequate 3-D porous structures and mechanical properties. 

In this work, we report a methodology for developing HAp scaffolds with a controllable architecture to 

find applications in tissue engineering of bone scaffolding. The physicochemical characterization of the 

macroporous HAp scaffolds was performed by using Fourier-transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy,   

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and scanning electron microscopy attached with an X-ray detector

(SEM/EDS). The microstructure of the HAp scaffolds was examined using micro-computed tomography 

(?-CT) analysis. The mechanical properties of the HAp scaffolds were assessed under compression 

testing. 

The bioactive behaviour of the HAp scaffolds was assessed by immersion into a simulated body fluid 

(SBF) solution. The changes in calcium and phosphate concentration in the SBF solution were 

monitored by inductively-coupled plasma optical emission (ICP-OES) spectrometry. 

Cytotoxicity of the HAp scaffolds leachables was evaluated by carrying out a cellular viability assay 

(MTS test) on mouse lung fibroblasts cells, which were previously in contact with the different HAp 

extract fluids. Rat bone marrow stromal cells adhesion and morphology were also analysed by SEM and 

under a 3-D fluorescence microscope, while the cell viability and proliferation were assessed by carrying 

out the Luminescent and LIVE/DEAD cell viability assays.  

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  

2.1. PREPARATION OF HAP SCAFFOLDS 

Calcium hydroxide (Riedel-de Haën, Germany) and ortho-phosphoric acid 85% (Panreac, Spain) 

solution were used to prepare separately, two precursors (Ca and P) solutions. HAp powders were 

obtained by adding in a controlled manner, appropriate amounts (Ca/P molar ratio of 1.67 was always 

used) of these solutions, using a peristaltic pump (Gilson Miniplus 3, France) at a speed rate                 

17 mL.min-1. The precipitation of the HAp particles occurred by adjusting the pH of the media to 11 with 

a 33% ammonium hydroxide (Riedel-de Haën, Germany) solution. Then, precipitate was filtered under 

vacuum and the excess of water removed by drying the filtrate at 60ºC for 24 hrs. After milling the HAp 

pellets until obtain a fine powder, the HAp scaffolds were fabricated. The procedure for obtaining the 

HAp scaffolds is summarized in Figure 1. Firstly, the HAp slurry was prepared by dispersing HAp 

powders in methanol for 48 hrs (step 1). Then, polyurethane (PU, Eurospuma SA, Portugal) cylindrical 

sponges (10 x 8 mm) featuring fully interconnected pores were dipped into the slurry until total 

impregnation. To prevent the formation of an external skin-like layer, the impregnated PU sponges were 

transferred to a centrifuge and the excess of slurry was removed by centrifuging at 60 rpm for 1 min 

(step 2), followed by drying at 37ºC, for 24 hrs (step 3) to avoid the formation of cracks. Finally, the 

impregnated sponges were placed inside the furnace and the PU matrices burned at 900ºC for 24 hrs, 

followed by sintering the HAp scaffolds at 1300ºC for 3 hrs (step 4). The HAp scaffolds were allowed to

naturally cool inside the furnace (step 5) and finally sterilized by ethylene oxide gas. Figure 2 shows the 

typical HAp scaffolds obtained, where replica of the PU sponge pores can be observed.  

2.2. CHARACTERIZATION OF THE HAP SCAFFOLDS 

2.2.1. Fourier-transform infra-red spectroscopy 

Potassium bromide (KBr, Riedel-de Haën, Germany) was used to prepare transparent discs (1:10 of 

sample/KBr (wt/wt)) for Fourier-transform infra-red (FTIR) analysis. A Perkin-Elmer 1600 series 

spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer, UK) was used to record the spectra that were collected with a 

minimum of 32 scans and resolution of 2 cm-1. The chemical change of the HAp after sintering was 

examined over a region of 4400-450 cm-1. 

2.2.2. Thermogravimetric analyses 

Thermal stability and composition of the PU sponges, PU sponge impregnated with HAp before burning, 

and HAp scaffolds sintered at 1300ºC was assessed by thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis. A TA-Q500 

analyser (TA Instruments, USA) was used. The data was obtained using a ramp rate of 5ºC.min-1. 

2.2.3. X-ray diffraction measurements 

Crystallinity and phase content of HAp powder, sintered HAp and HAp scaffolds were investigated with 

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, using an X-ray diffractometer (Philips PW 1710, The Netherlands). 

XRD patterns were examined in the region of 2º to 65º with a step size 0.02º for 2? and scan speed of 

0.6º.min-1.  

2.2.4. Scanning electron microscopy 

A scanning electron microscope attached with an energy dispersive electron probe X-ray analyzer 

(SEM-EDS, Leica Cambridge S-360, UK) was used to analyse both microstructure of HAp scaffolds 

before and after immersion into a simulated body fluid (SBF) solution, and PU sponges. All specimens 

were coated with gold using a Polaron SC 502 (Fisons Instruments, UK) coater, prior to observation.  

2.2.5. Micro-computed tomography 

The 3-D structural and architectural information of the HAp scaffolds was assessed quantitatively and 

qualitatively by means of micro-computed tomography (?-CT) analysis and using a Scanco 20

equipment (Scanco Medicals, Switzerland). A series of c.a. 900 2-D slices with a scanning resolution of 

11 µm were obtained by irradiating the specimen with penetrative X-rays of 50 keV. Mimics® from 

Materialise (Belgium) was used as image processing software. The porosity along the HAp scaffolds 

was also evaluated by 2-D morphometric analysis using a threshold 300 (Th 300).  

2.2.6. Mechanical testing 

Compression tests (dry state) were performed using a Universal Testing Machine (Instron 4505) 

containing a load cell of 50 kN. Experiments were conducted using a minimum number of 10 scaffolds. 

2.2.7. Bioactivity test 

HAp scaffolds were immersed in a simulated body fluid (SBF) solution at 37 ? 1ºC to assess the 

bioactivity, in vitro [24]. After each immersion time (1, 3, 7 and 15 days), the scaffolds were immediately 

rinsed with distilled water, dried at room temperature for 24 hrs and then dried in the oven at 60ºC until 

constant weight. The concentration of the Ca and P ions in the SBF solution was also measured by 

inductively-coupled plasma optical emission (ICP-OES, JY 70 plus, JobinYvon, France) spectrometry. 

Triplicate samples were analysed for each immersion time and averaged results calculated. 

2.3. IN VITRO CELL CULTURE STUDIES 

2.3.1. Cytotoxicity screening 

The MTS viability test was performed to investigate the cytotoxicity of the HAp scaffolds leachables. A 

cell line of mouse lung fibroblasts (L929 cells) purchased from European Collection of Cell Cultures 

(ECACC, UK). This type of cells has been used in cytotoxicyty assays to preliminarily test 

biocompatibility of potential biomaterials [25]. L929 cells were cultured in an DMEM (Dulbecco’s Modified 

Eagle’s Medium, Sigma, Germany) medium supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, 

UK), 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco, UK) solution containing 10,000 units.mL-1 penicillin G sodium, 

10,000 ?g.mL-1 streptomycin sulphate and 25 ?g.mL-1 amphotericin B as Fungizone® in 0.85% saline. 

The L929 cells were incubated in an atmosphere containing 5% of CO2 at 37ºC, and the medium 

changed every two days.  

The extracts fluid were prepared as previously reported by Gomes et al. [25]. Succinctly, extracts fluids 

were obtained by introducing the HAp scaffolds in a 50 mL conical tube with flip-top cap (BD Falcon™, 

USA) and complete DMEM culture medium was added. For all tests a ratio of outer surface of HAp

scaffolds to DMEM medium equal to 30 cm2.mL-1 was used. Then, the tubes were transferred to a 

thermostatic bath at 37ºC and 60 rpm for the period of 3 d. Different concentrations of HAp scaffolds 

extracts (25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) were prepared. A latex rubber extract was used as positive 

control. 

After reaching confluence, L929 cells were trypsinized (0.25% trypsin/EDTA solution, Sigma Chemical, 

USA) from a culture flask, and a diluted cell suspension was prepared in order to achieve a cellular 

concentration of 8 x 104 cells.mL-1. Afterwards, 1.6 x 104 cells were seeded in each well of a 96-well 

plate (five replicates per sample). Cells were incubated for 48 hrs in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37ºC, until 

achieving 80-90% of confluence. Afterwards, the culture medium in each well was replaced with the 

extraction fluids and incubated for 72 hrs. Then, an MTS assay was performed using 3-(4, 5-

dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) (MTS, Promega, 

USA), while cellular morphology was assessed by optical microscope (Zeiss-Axiovert 40, Germany). 

The cell viability (%) was calculated and compared to the tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS). All 

experiments were performed in triplicate. 

2.3.2. Cell viability and adhesion studies 

Rat bone marrow stromal cells (RBMSCs) were obtained from femora of 7 week-old male Fischer 344/N 

rats (SLC Inc. Japan). The animals were sacrificed following the protocol approved by the Ethics 

Committee at the Tissue Engineering Research Center (Amagasaki, Japan). Then, the femora’s were 

collected under aseptic conditions and the soft tissue eliminated. The epiphyseal regions were removed 

and the marrow flushed out with freshly prepared complete Eagle’s minimum essential medium (MEM, 

Nacalai Tesque, Japan) with 15% FBS (JRH Biosciences, USA) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Nacalai 

Tesque, Japan) solution, into a 15 mL Falcon. The RBMSCs were expanded in T75 cm2 (BD 

Biosciences Discovery Labware, Bedford, USA) culture flasks in the presence of complete culture 

medium and expanded under standard culturing conditions. The culture medium was changed each 2 or 

3 d. After cells reach confluency, 1 mL of 0.05% tripsin-0.53 mM EDTA (Invitrogen, USA) solution was 

added to detach the cells from the substrate. Then, complete culture medium was added and RBMSCs 

(passage 1, P1) were centrifuged at 900 rpm for 5 min. The cells re-suspended with 10 mL of complete 

culture medium, and cells counted using an automated counter (Cell Counter Sysmex F-520, Japan). 

Viability of RBMSCs was also analyzed with a NucleoCounter (Chemometec, Denmark), prior seeding 

[26]. After that, RBMSCs were seeded onto the HAp scaffolds at a cellular density of 5 x 102 

cells.scaffold-1, 1 x 103 cells.scaffold-1, 5 x 103 cells.scaffold-1 and 1 x 104 cells.scaffold-1 and cultured in

MEM medium for 24 hrs, 3 and 7 d under static conditions. After each time period, the ATP content 

which signals the presence of metabolically active cells was measured by means of performing a 

CellTiter-Glo® luminescent cell viability assay (Promega Corporation, USA). The luminescence was 

measured using opaque-walled multi-well plate in a microplate reader (Wallac ARVOsx 1420, Perkin-

Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, USA). This assay is based on a luminescence signal that is 

proportional to the amount of ATP, which by its turn is directly proportional to the number of viable cells. 

Moreover, cell adhesion and proliferation was investigated by means of using a LIVE/DEAD viability 

assay kit (Molecular Probes). RBMSCs were incubated with two probes, calcein-AM (green colour) and 

ethidium homodimer-1 (EtdD-1, bright red colour), for intracellular esterase activity and plasma 

membrane integrity, respectively [27]. Then, specimens were observed under a 3-D fluorescence 

microscope (Olympus SZX12 stereomicroscope, OLYMPUS Co. Ltd., Japan) and SEM. All experiments 

were carried out three times using a minimum of 3 samples per experimental condition.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

There is a huge clinical demand for novel synthetic tissue engineered scaffolds. Porosity, pore size and 

interconnectivity of the biomaterial scaffolds are known to play a critical role in bone formation [28]. 

Therefore, among the key requirements that should be idealized, scaffolds architecture is one of the 

most important features. However, the balanced porosity/mechanical performance of the scaffolds is an

issue that must not be forgotten, and thus should also be explored. To address this issue the present 

work describes a methodology for the preparation of HAp scaffolds to find applications on bone tissue 

engineering. These scaffolds were successfully obtained by impregnating a PU sponge with Hap 

particles, followed by burning the sacrifice polymeric template and sintering the final HAp porous 

structure (Figure 1). It is noteworthy that centrifugation (step 2) is a crucial for optimizing the 3-D 

architecture of the scaffolds. It removes the excessive impregnation of HAp slurry and this method 

allows obtaining a uniform porosity across the scaffold and macro- and open pore structure. 

The macroscopic appearance of the typical HAp scaffold is shown in Figure 2. It can be observed that 

the HAp scaffolds retained the typical shape of the original PU sponge and possess a trabeculae-like 

architecture.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 2. Macroscopic appearance of the HAp scaffolds after sintering at 1300ºC. 

FTIR analysis was performed to assess the chemical changes on the HAp structures during processing. 

Figure 3 shows the FTIR spectra of HAp before and after sintering. The results confirmed previous ones 

[29] that demonstrated, in both cases the existence of characteristic bands of HAp, namely at 598 and 

559 cm-1 (o), and at 1020 cm-1 (*) attributed to PO43- (?4 ) and PO43- (?3) groups, respectively (Figures 

3a-c). Another typical HAp band that can be observed is assigned to the stretching mode of OH group at 

3572 cm-1 (+). Moreover, it is also possible to observe the loosening of OH groups (?) from adsorbed, 

and bending mode of H2O after sintering HAp. Comparing the sintered HAp (Figure 3b) and HAp 

scaffolds (Figure 3c), it is possible to confirm that no differences were observed, and no characteristic

peaks of organic groups were found. This result clearly indicates that the heat treatment cycle applied is 

critical to avoid the undesired traces of PU sponge.

and (c) HAp scaffolds sintered at 1300ºC. 

To further clarify this issue thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed. Figure 4 shows the TGA 

of the PU sponges, PU sponges impregnated with HAp before burning and sintered HAp scaffolds. 

From results it can be seen that the ratio HAp:PU sponges was 80:20 wt% (Figure 4b).

Moreover, it can be seen that the melting point of PU sponges is about 300ºC, and PU sponge is 

completely burned around 400ºC. These findings have demonstrated that the thermal treatment of the 

HAp/PU sponges at 900ºC for the period of 24 hrs followed by sintering at 1300ºC proved to be 

adequate for the completely eliminating the PU sponges. This is particularly evident in Figure 4c, since 

no mass changes on the sintered HAp scaffolds were detected. 

It has been reported that sintering temperatures and sintering time have great effect on sintered density 

of different apatites [30,31]. Therefore, by increasing the sintered density we expected to increase the final 

mechanical properties of the HAp scaffolds. However, it is also known that high temperatures may affect 

the crystallinity and phase content of HAp [32]. Figure 5 shows the XRD pattern of HAp before and after 

different heat treatments. Examining the XRD patterns (Figures 5a-c) and comparing with that of the 

standard file for HAp from JCPDS (9-432) it can be observed that the peaks are perfectly matching. The 

XRD pattern of synthesized HAp was found to be amorphous (Figure 5a). After sintering the crystallinity 

of HAp increased and no decomposition products such as ?- or ?-tricalcium phosphates (TCP) [32] were 

detected. The complementary FTIR data also revealed the presence of typical OH groups (Figures 3b-c) 

of the HAp [33] showing that the synthesized HAp is quite stable upon sintering of the materials at 

1300ºC for 3 hrs.

As previously reported, the XRD data is also in good attainment with the FTIR spectra (Figure 3a). FTIR 

spectrum shows that carbonate ions are observed in the as synthetized HAp, the bands assigned to 

carbonate ?2 and ?3, at 875 cm-1 (#) and 1650-1300 cm-1, respectively. The XRD study revealed that 

the carbonate ions observed by FTIR are assigned to surface ones, rather than being embedded within 

the lattice of phosphate ions [29]. To evaluate the microstructure of the HAp scaffolds, SEM analysis 

were performed as shown in Figure 6. The SEM images of the PU foams evidenced an “open-cell” and 

highly interconnected porous structure (Figures 6a-b), that facilitated the impregnation of hydroxylapatite 

particulates. From figure 6c it can be observed that the architecture of the obtained HAp scaffolds is 

analogous to the sacrifice template. In addition, the pore geometry is also quite similar (Figures 6b and 

d), showing a macroporous and highly interconnected structure with pore size comprised in the range of 

50-600 ?m. Such type of morphology and pore dimension has been shown to be adequate for bone 

tissue engineering purposes [28,34,35]. Note that the final pore architecture could be easily controlled by 

changing the structure of the PU foam. These results have demonstrated that the centrifugation step is 

required to prevent the formation of an external “skin-like” layer, i.e. non-porous HAp layer which can be 

a disadvantage for the cells adhesion and in-growths during seeding as well as proliferation and proper 

flow of culture medium [35,36].

The structure and architecture of the HAp scaffolds was further examined in a non-destructive manner 

by means of ?-CT analysis (Figure 7). Figure 7a shows the 2-D morphometric analysis of the HAp 

scaffolds. It revealed that the mean porosity is about 67.8 ± 5.0%. Additionally, it can be seen that 

scaffolds present a uniform architecture and pore distribution. No gaps or empty spaces were observed, 

i.e. the impregnation technique allows obtaining 3-D structures mimicking the PU template. As 

previously mentioned, besides the need of scaffolds high porosity, the pores should be interconnected 

to allow the diffusion of culture medium, metabolic wastes and oxygen, and to facilitate the infiltration 

and proliferation of cells [37]. The transversal (Figure 7b) and longitudinal (Figure 7c) views of the HAp 

scaffolds, clearly showed that pore network is highly interconnected (black arrows). This result 

demonstrates that the centrifugation step not only prohibits the formation of an external ‘skin-like’ layer 

but also allows a uniform pore distribution and interconnectivity across the HAp scaffolds.

It is well known that a compromise between porosity and mechanical properties exists, where higher 

porosity results in lower mechanical strength of the scaffold [38,39]. The compressive strength of the HAp 

scaffolds was found to be 30.2 ? 6.0 MPa. Previous reports have shown that for a HAp scaffolds 

possessing 77% of porosity compressive strength was about 17.4 MPa [40]. Therefore, as compared to 

others ceramic porous structures described in literature [23,40], our data presents a good compromise 

between porosity and mechanical performance, i.e. 67.8 ± 5.0% and 30.2 ? 6.0 MPa, respectively. 

In the present work another issue that was address consisted on evaluating the bioactivity behaviour of 

HAp scaffolds, in vitro. Figure 8 shows the SEM images of the surface of HAp scaffolds before and after 

immersion in SBF for 1 to 15 d. It was possible to observe the deposition of precipitates after 1 d (Figure 

8b), which tend to be more pronounced for longer soaking time (Figures 8c-d). The formation of these 

precipitates, which were covering the whole HAp surface, resembles the ‘cauliflower-like’ morphology of 

apatite formed in vitro, onto bioactive surfaces. Additionally, changes in calcium (Ca) and phosphorus 

(P) ions in SBF solution was also monitored by ICP. Figure 9 shows that Ca concentration increased in 

the SBF solution in the first 24 hrs. However, it is not detected an expected increase in P concentration 

during this period. This can be explained due to a fast consumption of P during apatite nucleation 

phase.

From day 1 to day 15, we assist to both decrease in the concentration of Ca and P. This trend may be a 

consequence of the consumption of both calcium and phosphorus upon the deposition of the apatite 

layer at the surface of the HAp scaffolds, as detected by SEM (Figures 8b-d). These findings are in 

agreement with the data available in literature [41], which has been shown that HAp is bioactive in nature 

due to a phenomenon involving the dissolution of calcium and phosphate ions from the HAp.

day 0 up to day 15. 

As previously reported by Kirkpatrick et al. [42], there are several ways to assess the toxicity in vitro. In 

this study, L929 cells were used for preliminarily screen toxicity.  Cytotoxicity of the HAp scaffolds was 

initially assessed through cell death observation in the inverted microscope (Figure 10). It can be 

observed that after 72 hrs in contact with a latex rubber extract (positive control), the L929 cells round 

up and detached from the culture substratum, which is indicative of the high cytotoxicity of the material 

(Figure 10b). On the contrary, when exposing to the different concentrations of HAp extract (Figures 

10c-f), the L929 cells exhibited a normal morphology, proliferated well and established a monolayer 

when comparing to the negative control (Figure 10a). Therefore, these preliminary results show that no 

toxic traces of PU sponges remained on the HAp scaffolds, and that HAp scaffolds were biocompatible. 

Complementarily, cell viability was investigated by carrying out the MTS test (Figure 11). The results 

once corroborated the direct observation under the microscope which showed that L929 cells were 

viable after contacting with the different HAp extract fluids for the period of 72 hrs.

Cell viability and proliferation on the scaffolds is one of the prerequisite for the 3-D supports find 

applications in the TE [43]. In order to investigate other aspects of cytotoxicity, such as the cell/scaffold 

interactions, direct contact experiments were performed on the macroporous HAp scaffolds using rat 

bone marrow stromal cells (RBMSCs). On the other hand, for optimizing the cell seeding efficiency in 

respect to cell adhesion and proliferative capacity of RBMSCs onto the macroporous HAp scaffolds 

different cell numbers were tested. Figure 12 shows the luminescent cell viability assay of RBMSCs 

seeded onto the surface of the HAp scaffolds after culturing for 7 d.

This assay is based on a luminescence signal that is proportional to the amount of ATP, which signals 

the presence of metabolically active cells. From figure 12, it can be observed that RBMSCs seeded at 

higher cell numbers proliferated well and were viable after culturing onto the macroporous HAp scaffolds 

for 7 d. On the contrary, the low cell density has shown to influence negatively the proliferation of 

RBMSCs, as observed by the low cell numbers, after 7 d of culturing. Nevertheless, the number of 

viable cells increased with an increase of culture time for all cell densities tested. This data shows that 

cell seeding efficiency increased with the increase in cell concentration. This is an expected result since 

it has been shown that cells needs a proper microenvironment not only with respect to 3-D scaffold but 

also by means of interacting with other cells through cell-cell junctions and signaling [44,45]. Therefore, 

this data demonstrated that the cell seeding conditions, namely the cell numbers needs to be optimized. 

The high cell concentration used seems to be more adequate for the RBMSCs/HAp constructs fully 

achieve physiologic functions upon implantation.   Figure 13 shows the fluorescence microscopy images 

of the HAp scaffolds seeded with RBMSCs after performing a two-colour fluorescence LIVE/DEAD cell 

viability assay. This type of assay allows distinguishing live from dead cells because calcein-AM is 

enzimatically converted into calcein, which is retained within live cells and produces an intense green 

fluorescence. On the other hand, dead cells are stained in a bright red fluorescence since EtdD-1 only 

enters cells with damaged membranes and binds to nucleic acids. From the fluorescence signals it can 

be observed that RBMSCs adhered, proliferated and remained viable after 7 d. Moreover, dead cells 

were present in low numbers as detected by the low bright red fluorescence. Moreover, it can be seen 

that RBMSCs were able to penetrate deeper into the core of the HAp scaffolds (Figure 13c). This is an 

important data since it has been shown [35,39] that cell infiltration and distribution within the whole 

scaffold will greatly affect the overall performance of the cells/scaffold construct.

To further investigate the RBMSCs adhesion onto the surface of the macroporous HAp scaffolds SEM 

analysis were also carried out. Figure 14 shows the SEM images of the RBMSCs on the surface of the 

macroporous HAp scaffolds after 24 hrs and 7 d. It can be observed that RBMSCs aggregated and 

adhered onto the surface of the HAp scaffolds but presents a spherical morphology, after 24 hrs (Figure 

14a). The morphology and small size are typical of the cells initial anchorage stage. After a longer 

period of culturing, RBMSCs spread actively and presented a flatten morphology showing a good 

anchoring to the substrate by multiple lamellipodia (Figure 14b).  

Despite the biocompatibility and capacity of supporting normal cellular functions, the macroporous HAp 

scaffolds also have to support the differentiation of the stem cells both in vitro and in vivo. It can be seen 

from figure 14 that there are no indications of osteogenic differentiation, namely the extracellular 

mineralized matrix cannot be detected. This is an expected result since osteogenic factors medium were 

not added to culture medium. On the other hand hydroxylapatite is known to lack the osteoinductive 

capacity. This is an relevant feature that needs to be met in a variety of bone related clinical strategies 

and to which our research groups [46,47] have been giving great deal of attention. Moreover, the present 

data is promising since in future experiments, we propose to evaluate the HAp/RBMSCs constructs 

functionality, namely the ability of the HAp scaffolds to support the RBMSCs osteogenesis and bone 

formation, in vitro and in vivo, respectively.

4. CONCLUSIONS 

This work demonstrated that it is possible to prepare sintered hydroxylapatite (HAp) scaffolds with high 

interconnectivity by impregnating an ‘open-cell’ PU sponge into a HAp slurry, followed by burning the

“sacrifice template”. The preparation route was optimized for producing macroporous HAp structures 

with controlled morphology, easily mediated by the architecture of the PU sponge. In vitro tests have 

demonstrated that such constructs are bioactive, as observed by the formation of an apatite layer after 1 

day of immersion in SBF solution. The biocompatible behaviour of the macroporous HAp scaffold was 

demonstrated as evidenced by the non-cytotoxic effect over L929 cells. Moreover, the cell/material 

interaction tests have shown that the rat bone marrow stromal cells adhered, proliferated well and 

remained viable on the macroporous hydroxylapatite scaffolds. More importantly, the cells were able to 

populate the inner of the macroporous hydroxylapatite scaffolds. Therefore, the physicochemical and 

biological properties of the macroporous hydroxylapatite scaffolds have shown to suitable for find 

applications in bone tissue engineering scaffolding.

Novel hydroxylapatite/chitosan bilayered scaffold for osteochondral tissue engineering 

applications: scaffold design and its performance when seeded with goat bone marrow stromal 

cells  

Abstract 

Recent studies suggest that bone marrow stromal cells are a potential source of osteoblasts and 

chondrocytes and can be used to regenerate damaged tissues using a tissue engineering (TE) 

approach. However, these strategies require the use of an appropriate scaffold architecture that can 

support the formation de novo of either bone and cartilage tissue, or both, as in the case of 

osteochondral defects. The later has been attracting a great deal of attention since it is considered a 

difficult goal to achieve. This work consisted on developing novel hydroxylapatite/chitosan (HAp/CHT) 

bilayered scaffold by combining a sintering and a freeze-drying technique, and aims to show the 

potential of such type of scaffolds for being used in TE of osteochondral defects. The developed 

HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds were characterized by Fourier-transform infra-red spectroscopy, X-ray 

diffraction analysis, micro-computed tomography, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). 

Additionally, the mechanical properties of HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds were assessed under 

compression. In vitro tests were also carried out, in order to study the water-uptake and weight loss 

profile of the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds. This was done by means of soaking the scaffolds into a 

phosphate buffered saline for 1 up to 30 days. The intrinsic cytotoxicity of the HAp scaffolds and 

HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds extract fluids was investigated by carrying out a cellular viability assay 

(MTS test) using Mouse fibroblastic-like cells. Results have shown that materials do not exert any 

cytotoxic effect. Complementarily, in vitro (phase I) cell culture studies were carried out to evaluate the 

capacity of HAp and CHT layers to separately, support the growth and differentiation of goat marrow 

stromal cells (GBMSCs) into osteoblasts and chondrocytes, respectively. Cell adhesion and morphology 

were analysed by SEM while the cell viability and proliferation were assessed by MTS test and DNA 

quantification. The chondrogenic differentiation of GBMSCs was evaluated measuring the 

glucosaminoglycans synthesis. Data showed that GBMSCs were able to adhere, proliferate and 

osteogenic differentiation was evaluated by alkaline phosphatase activity and immunocytochemistry 

assays after 14 days in osteogenic medium and into chondrocytes after 21 days in culture with 

chondrogenic medium. The obtained results concerning the physicochemical and biological properties

of the developed HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds show that these constructs exhibit great potential for their 

use in TE strategies leading to the formation of adequate tissue substitutes for the regeneration of 

osteochondral defects.

1. INTRODUCTION 

In the skeleton, articular cartilages allows a stable movement with near frictionless and consequently act 

as a unique protective interface for the underlying bone. This is achieved in part, since articular 

cartilages resists to compressive forces due to the ability to distribute loads [1,2]. General features of 

cartilage tissue includes: (i) a small number of chondrocytes with low proliferation rate and having both 

catabolic and anabolic functions, (ii) a high content of water where metabolites and a large amount of 

electrolytes are dissolved, (iii) an abundant extracellular matrix (ECM) composed by different types of 

collagens (mainly type II) and proteoglycan aggrecan, which is the main responsible for the elasticity, 

and (iv) possess no nerve and vascular systems [1,3]. Actually, the different cell numbers, organization 

and distribution, as well as organic and water content across cartilage are responsible for the existence 

of three distinct layers with respect to depth, i.e. superficial, middle and deep [4]. In this respect, Kuettner 

et al. [4] have suggested that the variations among articular cartilages is mainly due to significant 

changes in biochemical composition and biomechanical properties of the three layers.  

It is well known that cartilage has a limited regeneration capacity upon damage. In certain extent, this is 

explained by the fact of being an avascular tissue, regenerative cells cannot migrate to the defect void 

unless the lesion goes beyond the subchondral bone plate [5,6]. Therefore, a regenerative response will 

be only possible when it is provided an artificial access by the marrow [7]. This consideration is subjacent 

on several clinical strategies that are currently employed on the treatment of small cartilage lesions 

namely, the subchondral abrasion, Pridie perforations, micro-fracture, and transplantation of 

osteochondral plugs [6,8-10]. Although, in most cases after clinical intervention the repaired tissue tends to 

degenerate and occur the formation of the undesired fibrocartilage [5,11,12]. More recently, it was reported 

an alternative approach, which consists on injecting autologous chondrocytes at the defect void [13-15]. 

Even though, this strategy does not avoid the excision of healthy cartilage from the joint for further 

expansion of the freshly isolated chondrocytes in vitro. Despite the encouraging results, there are a few 

critical requirements for the success of this approach. For example, the need to obtain high cell 

numbers, while maintaining chondrocyte functions. In this respect, it is well known [16,17] that conditions 

favouring maintenance of phenotype are usually different from those that favour a high cell density, and 

consequently there are limitations in the number of cells obtained in vitro for subsequent clinical 

application. Therefore, the low rate of success especially in large lesions and in older people, and the 

procedural constraints are the major drawback of these techniques [18].  

In order to eliminate donor site morbidity, which is one the major limitation of autografts, several tissue 

engineered (TE) cartilaginous cell-scaffolds constructs have been proposed [19,20]. But, since we have

performance when seeded with goat bone marrow stromal cells

been able to gain new insights related with the role of subchondral bone, it seems obvious the 

enormous implications in the field of tissue engineering namely, in respect to the development of more 

adequate scaffolds architectures for cartilage healing. In this respect, several authors have been 

proposing the use of bilayered osteochondral constructs for the improved regeneration of cartilage 

defects [21-23]. Basically, this conceptual approach consists on developing a single 3-D porous structure 

that combines a mechanical support resembling the subchondral bone (bone-like layer), while also 

providing a chondrogenic support in the top for the repairing of cartilage (cartilage-like layer) [24,25]. 

Materials like hydroxylapatite (HAp) [26-28] and chitosan (CHT) [29-31] have been widely employed to 

develop suitable 3-D supports for applications in tissue engineering of bone and cartilage, respectively. 

Therefore, on the basis of the osteochondral approaches, the development of bilayered osteochondral 

scaffolds combining both HAp and CHT layers thus seems a good approach. Although, a strong 

mechanical interface between mineral substrate and polymer matrix is required for preventing a 

premature failure of the scaffold. Schek et al. [25] has been described the use of poly lactic acid (PLA) 

rods for connecting a HAp and PLA phases of a biphasic composite scaffold. Nevertheless, the effect of 

the polymeric rods on bone and cartilage regeneration is not studied. Therefore, there is the need of 

more simple and reliable strategies to manufacture bilayered scaffolds for osteochondral applications. 

Besides the choice of adequate materials and the optimization of the mechanical properties and 

architecture for the scaffolds, TE strategies requires the use of cell sources, that should be viable in 

terms of clinical practice and that can be effective in new tissue formation. Research focused on tissue 

regeneration by means of using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is increasingly attracting a great deal 

of attention, since MSCs have the ability to differentiate into various mesenchymal lineages [32-34] under 

specific culture conditions [35]. In fact, MSCs are one of the most promising candidates for 

transplantation after seeding into tissue-engineered implants [36-39].  

In this study it is described the developmental route, physicochemical characterization and biological 

evaluation of novel 3-D macroporous hydroxylapatite/chitosan (HAp/CHT) bilayered scaffolds. HAp 

scaffolds (bone-like layer) were firstly produced by means of sintering. Then, the CHT porous layer 

(cartilage-like layer) was obtained by means of freeze-drying a chitosan solution poured onto the top of 

the HAp scaffolds. The physicochemical characterization of both organic and inorganic layers was 

performed by Fourier-transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, micro-

computed tomography (?-CT), and scanning electron microscopy attached with an X-ray detector 

(SEM/EDS). The mechanical properties of the HAp, CHT porous layers and HAp/CHT bilayered 

scaffolds were assessed by compression tests. In vitro tests were also carried out to investigate the

performance when seeded with goat bone marrow stromal cells 

- 197 - 
 
 

water-uptake and weight loss behaviour of the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds by soaking into a 

phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 1 up to 30 days.  

The intrinsic cytotoxicity of the HAp porous layer and HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds leachables was 

examined by carrying out a cellular viability assay (MTS test) using Mouse fibroblastic-like cells, which 

were previously in contact with the different concentrations of the scaffolds extract fluids. Moreover, a 

preliminary in vitro cultivation, proliferation and differentiation study was performed upon seeding of goat 

bone marrow stromal cells (GBMSCs) onto HAp and CHT layers (Phase I). GBMSCs have showed to 

present high proliferation and viability rates in fresh or cryopreserved cultures. These cells are quite 

stable in 2-D cultures and differentiate into osteogenic and chondrogenic phenotypic cells in the 

presence of supplemented osteogenic and chondrogenic media, respectively. Beside that, it is possible 

to use an autologous approach with the goat animal model and, in future experiments, evaluate in vivo, 

the osteochondral constructs functionality of HAp and CHT using marrow cells harvested from same 

animal implanted with the in vitro TE construct. Relative GBMSCs viability and proliferation was 

assessed by MTS test and by DNA quantification, while cellular adhesion and morphology was 

investigated by SEM. Osteogenic differentiation was assessed by alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) 

and immunocytochemistry techniques for type I collagen and osteopontin. Glucosaminoglycans 

quantification assay was performed to evaluate chondrogenic differentiation. 

Future studies will be designed to investigate the capacity of the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds to favour 

simultaneous osteoblasts and chondrocytes proliferation and differentiation upon seeding GBMSCs, 

leading to the formation of adequate tissue substitutes for the regeneration of osteochondral defects. 

With this approach it is aimed to develop an autologous model for further implantantion in vivo. 

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  

2.1. SYNTHESIS OF HAP 

Analytical reagent grade calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2 (Riedel-de Haën, Germany) and ortho-phosphoric 

acid, H3PO4 (Panreac, Spain) were used on the synthesis of the HAp powders. An controlled drop-wise 

automated apparatus was developed by means of using a peristaltic pump (Gilson Miniplus 3, France) 

for adding a diluted solution of ortho-phosphoric acid to the calcium hydroxide solution, in a reaction 

vessel. Synthesis conditions were adjusted to obtain a stoichiometric HAp, i.e. Ca/P ratio of 1.67. After 

complete addition of the acid solution, the final pH of medium was adjusted to 11 with concentrated 

ammonium hydroxide (Riedel-de Haën, Germany). Vigorous stirring was continued during HAp 

precipitation. The supernatant was removed after 24 hours of maturation, and the precipitate filtered

under vacuum. The resulting filtrate was dried at 60ºC for 24 hours and milled in a mortar until obtaining 

a fine powder. 

2.2. PREPARATION OF HAP SCAFFOLDS AND HAP/CHT BILAYERED SCAFFOLDS  

Hydroxyapatite/chitosan (HAp/CHT) bilayered scaffolds were produced by adopting a two step 

procedure. Firstly, hydroxylapatite (HAp) porous layer (bone-like layer) with 10 mm height and 8 mm 

diameter were obtained by means of impregnating a polyurethane (PU) sponge with HAp powders, as 

previously reported by Oliveira et al. [40]. The elimination of the organic matrix consisted on burning the 

impregnated sponges in the furnace (Fornocerâmica-ATR 901, Portugal) at 900ºC for 24 hours, 

followed by sintering at 1300ºC for 3 hours, at ramp rate of 2.5ºC.min-1. Secondly, a 3 wt% chitosan 

solution was prepared by dissolving chitosan (CHT) of medium molecular weight (Aldrich, Germany) 

and a degree of deacetylation of ~85% in 0.2 M acetic acid solution. The bilayered HAp/CHT scaffolds 

were fabricated by placing the HAp scaffolds into cylindrical silicon moulds (20 mm x 8 mm) and 

transferring the 3 wt% CHT solution. To guarantee that chitosan interpenetrated into the HAp scaffolds it 

was left resting for 1 minute at room temperature. Moulds were freeze at -80ºC and lyophilized (Telstar-

Cryodos -80, Spain) up to 4 days to complete remove the frozen solvent, and allow obtaining the 

‘cartilage-like layer’ on the top of the ‘bone-like layer’. Then, HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds were 

neutralized using a 0.1 M sodium hydroxide solution as previously described elsewhere [41], freeze at       

-80ºC and once lyophilized. Finally, the resulting HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds were sterilized using 

ethylene oxide before carrying out the cell culture studies. 

2.3. PHYSICOCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION  

2.3.1. FTIR spectroscopy 

Infra-red spectra of specimen powders were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer 

1600 series equipment, USA). Prior analysis transparent KBr (Riedel-de Haën, Germany) pellets were 

prepared by mixing in the ratio of 1:10 of sample/KBr (wt/wt), followed by uniaxially pressing the 

powders under vacuum. All spectra were obtained between 4400-450 cm-1 at a 2 cm-1 resolution. 

2.3.2. XRD analysis 

X-ray diffractometer (Philips PW 1710, The Netherlands) employing Cu-K? radiation was used to 

investigate the cristallinity and phase content of the HAp scaffolds on powder. Data was collected from 2 

to 65º 2? values, with a step size of 0.02º, and a counting time of 2 seconds.step-1.

performance when seeded with goat bone marrow stromal cells 

- 199 - 
 
 

2.3.3. Surface topography characterization 

The surface morphology and pore size of the HAp scaffolds and HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds were 

examined under the scanning electron microscope attached with an X-ray detector, SEM/EDS (Leica 

Cambridge S-360, UK). Prior to the microstructure analysis, specimens were coated with gold using a 

Fisons Instruments Coater (Polaron SC 502, UK) with a current set at 18 mA, for a coating time of 120 

seconds.  

2.3.4. Micro-computed tomography 

The qualitative information of the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds architecture was obtained by 

microtomography imaging using the Scanco 20 equipment (Scanco Medicals, Switzerland) with 

penetrative X-rays of 50 keV. The X-ray scans were acquired in high resolution mode (11 µm). Mimics® 

software (Materialise, Belgium) was used to visualize the 2-D X-ray sections images of the HAp/CHT 

bilayered scaffolds. From the CT data set, 300 slices of a region of interest corresponding to the 

interface between HAp and CHT was used to investigate the continuity of the HAp/CHT bilayered 

scaffolds. A customized threshold technique was used to enhance the CHT contrast and remove noise. 

2.3.5. Mechanical testing 

Compression tests (dry state) were performed using a Universal Testing Machine (Instron 4505) 

possessing a load cell of 50 kN, at room temperature. The gauge length and diameter of all specimens 

was 16 mm and 8 mm, respectively. Tests were conducted with a constant strain rate of 2 mm.minute-1, 

and up to failure or until 60% reduction in specimen height. The modulus (E) was determined by linear 

regression from the slopes in the initial elastic portion of the stress-strain diagram. A minimum number 

of 10 specimens were tested, and then E was averaged from the 10 measurements. 

2.3.6. Water uptake and weight loss studies 

Water-uptake and weight loss of the HAp scaffolds and HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds were evaluated 

after immersion into a phosphate-buffered saline, PBS (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) solution at pH 7.4, for 

time periods up to 30 days. All experiments were conducted at 37 ? 1ºC, and in triplicate. Percentage of 

water-uptake (WUs) after each time of immersion (t) was calculated using equation (1), where Wd and 

Ww correspond to the weight of the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds before and after immersion into PBS 

solution, respectively:

WUs,t = [(Ww,t-Wd)/ Wd] x 100            (1) 

The percentage of weight loss (WLs) after each time of immersion (t) was calculated using equation (2), 

where Wi and Wf corresponds to the weight they before and after immersion into PBS solution, 

respectively: 

WLs,t = [(Wf,t-Wi)/ Wi] x 100               (2) 

2.4. IN VITRO CELL CULTURE STUDIES 

2.4.1. Cytotoxicity screening 

MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) test 

was performed to determine the cytotoxicity of HAp porous scaffolds and HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds 

leachables that might result from the processing methodology used to obtain the HAp scaffolds and/or 

leachables of the polymeric component of the bilayered materials. Mouse fibroblastic-like cells (L929 

cells; ECACC, UK), were cultured in basic medium: D-MEM (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium, 

Sigma-Aldrich, USA) without phenol red supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum, FBS (Gibco, UK) 

and antibiotic-antimycotic (1% A/B, Gibco, UK) solution containing 10,000 units.mL-1 penicillin G 

sodium, 10,000 ?g.mL-1 streptomycin sulphate and 25 ?g.mL-1 amphotericin B as Fungizone® in 0.85% 

saline. L929 cells were incubated at 37ºC in an atmosphere containing 5% of CO2, and after achieving 

confluence a cell suspension was prepared with a concentration of 8 x 104 cells.mL-1 and seeded onto 

96-well plates. L929 cells were incubated for 3 days with different concentrations of HAp and HAp/CHT 

bilayered scaffolds extracts (25%, 50%, 75% and 100%). Eight replicates were considered per sample. 

Extracts of all samples were prepared as previously described by Gomes et al. [42].  

L929 cells relative viability (%) was determined for each extract concentration and compared to tissue 

culture polystyrene (TCPS). Latex extracts were used as a positive control of cellular death. All 

cytotoxicity tests were performed in triplicate. 

2.4.2. Isolation and culture of GBMSCs 

Bone marrow stromal cells were isolated from the iliac crest of adult goats and cultured with basic 

culture medium - DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% A/B. Cells were cultured until confluence 

and sub-cultured at P1 and P2 before seeding. The relative viability of GBMSCs on the HAp scaffolds 

was also determined by carrying out an MTS assay, after each time point. For this purpose, cells-HAp

performance when seeded with goat bone marrow stromal cells 

- 201 - 
 
 

scaffold constructs were transferred into a 48-well plate and washed twice with sterile PBS. Culture 

medium without FBS and without phenol red was mixed with MTS in a 5:1 ratio, added to the wells, until 

totally cover the constructs, and incubated for 3 hours at 37ºC in a 5% CO2 incubator. After the 

incubation period, 100 µL of MTS and medium mixture were transferred into each well of a 96-well plate 

and absorbance was read at 490 nm. 

2.4.3. Seeding of GBMSCs onto the HAp porous layer and 3-D culturing (Phase IA)  

GBMSCs cells were enzymatically lifted with 3 mL of trypsin after reaching 80% of confluence at P1 or 

P2. A cell suspension was prepared and seeded onto the HAp porous layer in a scaffold drop-wise 

manner, at a cellular density of 2.1 x 105 cells.mL-1. Cells/scaffolds constructs were cultured in 48-well 

plates for 3 days with basic medium in static conditions. For inducing osteogenic differentiation, cell-

seeded scaffolds were cultured with an osteogenic media consisting of alpha-MEM (Minimal Essential 

Medium Eagle alpha modification, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) supplemented with osteogenic supplements 

namely, 10-8 M dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 50 ?g.mL-1 ascorbic acid (Sigma, USA) and 10 

mM ?-glycerophosphate (Sigma, USA). The constructs were cultured for 3 days in static cultures with 

basal medium plus 14 days in osteogenic medium (17 days) and under dynamic conditions by using a 

lab rotator (Model DSR 2800 V, Digisystem Laboratory Instruments Inc., Taiwan). Samples were 

collected on day 0 (12 hours after seeding), day 3 and day 17 for further studies. 

2.4.4. Seeding of GBMSCs onto the CHT porous layer and 3-D culturing (Phase IB)  

To induce chondrogenic differentiation, CHT scaffolds were seeded with 2.5 x 105 cells and cultured for 

7, 21 and 28 days with chondrogenic medium consisting of DMEM (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium, 

Sigma-Aldrich, USA) supplemented with 10 ?g.mL-1 TGF-? (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), ITS+1 (100 x liquid 

media supplement, Sigma, USA), 0.1 M sodium pyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 35 mM proline (Sigma-

Aldrich, USA), 17 mM ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and 1 mM dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich, 

USA). The cell-scaffold constructs were also cultured under dynamic conditions by using a lab rotator 

system. Samples were retrieved after 7, 21 and 28 days of chondrogenic culture. Before chondrogenic 

medium was added, samples were cultured for 3 days in basal medium in static conditions. In both 

cases, culture media were changed every 2-3 days. 

2.4.5. Evaluation of GBMSCs adhesion and morphology

performance when seeded with goat bone marrow stromal cells 

 

 
- 202 - 
 
 

Culturing GBMSCs adhesion and morphology was investigated by SEM analysis. For this purpose, after 

each culturing period, samples were removed from culture, washed in PBS, fixed in 2.5% 

glutaraldehyde, rinsed two times with PBS and dehydrated in series of ethanol concentrations. The 

samples were then dried at room temperature and sputter coated with gold before observation under the 

SEM. 

2.4.6. Assessment of GBMSCs proliferation and differentiation 

GBMSCs-HAp and -CHT construct celullarity was determined using a fluorimetric dsDNA quantification 

kit (PicoGreen, Molecular Probes). For this purpose, samples collected on day 0, day 3 and day 17, 

were washed twice with a sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Sigma, USA) solution and transferred 

into 1.5 mL microtubes containing 1 mL of ultra-pure water. GBMSCs-HAp and -CHT were incubated for 

1 hour at 37ºC in a water-bath and then stored in a -80ºC freezer until testing. Prior to DNA 

quantification constructs were thawed and sonicated for 15 minutes. Samples and standards (ranging 

between 0 and 2 µg.mL-1) were prepared per each well of an opaque 96-well plate were added 28.7 µL 

of sample or standard plus 71.3 µL of PicoGreen solution and 100 µL of Tris-EDTA buffer. Triplicates 

were made for each sample or standard. The plate was incubated for 10 minutes in the dark and 

fluorescence was measured on a microplate ELISA reader (BioTek, USA) using an emission of 490 nm 

and an absorbance wavelength of 520 nm. A standard curve was created and sample DNA values were 

read off from the standard graph. 

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was measured to evaluate osteoblastic differentiation. Cell-HAp 

scaffold constructs used for DNA quantification assay were used to determine ALP levels. As cells were 

lysed during the above mentioned procedure, both DNA and other cell produced proteins were in 

suspension in the supernatant solution. So, to each well of a 96-well plate were added 20 µL of sample 

plus 60 µL of substrate solution: 0.2% (wt/v) p-nytrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) in a substrate buffer: 1 M 

diethanolamine HCl (Merck, Germany), at pH 9.8. The plate was then incubated in the dark for 45 

minutes at 37ºC. After the incubation period, 80 µL of a stop solution: 2 M NaOH (Panreac) containing 

0.2 mM EDTA (Sigma, USA), was added to each well. Standards were prepared with 10 µmol.mL-1       

p-nytrophenol, pNP (Sigma, USA) and the stop solutions in order to achieve the final concentrations 

ranging between 0 and 0.3 µmol.mL-1. Triplicates were made for each sample and standard. 

Absorbance was read at 405 nm and sample concentrations were read off from standard graph.  

Immunocytochemistry technique was performed by fixing cell-HAp scaffold constructs in an Accustain 

formalin solution, 10 % neutral buffered (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 1 hour at 4ºC, washing with PBS and

including the constructs into methacrylate blocks. These blocks were cut into 10 ?m thick slides and 

kept overnight at 80ºC before being used for subsequent immunocytochemistry analysis. The 

procedures immunocytochemistry were carried out following the instructions included in commercial kit: 

the RTU Vector Stain kit – Universal Elite ABC kit PK7200 (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, USA). 

This kit was used with a Peroxidase Substract Kit – DAB SK4100 (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, 

USA). For this study, samples were incubated with collagen type I (1/100, Chemicon, USA) for 1.6 hours 

and the biotinylated secondary antibody was incubated for 1 hour prior to wash and incubate the 

constructs with DAB for about 6 minutes. Also an osteopontin antibody (1/100, Rabitt polyclonal to 

osteopontin, Abcam, UK) was tested using slides from the same constructs. Although in this particular 

case, a fluorescent secondary antibody was used instead of a biotinylated one and kept overnight at 

80ºC. The metacrylate sections were incubated with osteopontin antibody, washed and then Alexa Fluor 

488 secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, UK) was added to cell-HAp scaffold constructs. 

The incubation periods used were the same for both type I collagen and osteopontin antibodies. The 

observation of the constructs was performed using an Axio Imager Z1 microscope (Zeiss, Germany). 

Glucosaminoglycans (GAGs) quantification assay [43] was used to determine extracellular chondrogenic 

matrix formation after day 7, day 21 and day 28 of chondrogenic medium culture. Cell-CHT scaffold 

constructs used for this assay were the same used for ALP and DNA assays. GAGs standards were 

obtained by preparing a chondroitin sulphate solution ranging from 0 and 30 µg.mL-1. In each well of a 

96-well plate, 20 µL of sample or standard were added in triplicates and then 250 µL per well of 

dimethylmethylene blue (DMB, Sigma Aldrich, USA) was added and mixed. The optical density was 

measured immediately at 525 nm on a microplate ELISA reader. A standard curve was created and 

GAGs sample values were read off from the standard graph. 

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

3.1. CHARACTERIZATION 

The exploitation of a variety of biomaterials and cultured cells in tissue engineering (TE) approaches 

offers a wide range of possibilities for the successful repair of different skeleton damages. The ideal 

strategy for the treatment of osteochondral defects requires a scaffold architecture possessing a 

‘cartilage-like’ layer and a ‘bone-like’ layer (lower) [44]. With this approach, the porous bilayered structure 

is expected to act as a support for cells functions and ultimately, leading to the de novo formation of an 

articular cartilage-like tissue in the cartilage void, while providing a good fixation on the underlying bone.

Previously, it was shown [45] that it is possible to develop a 3-D macroporous HAp structures by 

impregnation of PU sponges with HAp particles, followed by burning the organic template and sintering 

the ceramic at 1300ºC. Moreover, it is well known that a wide number of highly porous scaffold systems 

may be prepared by means of freezing a polymer solution and subsequently freeze-drying. In this study, 

we developed a novel bilayered scaffold by means of pouring a 3 wt% chitosan solution upon the 

sintered HAp scaffolds followed by a freeze-drying procedure. Figure 1 shows the macroscopic 

appearance of the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds. The macro image shows two distinct layers, which 

corresponds to HAp (bottom layer) and CHT (upper layer). The improved stability at the inorganic-

organic interface and overall integrity of the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds was achieved by partially 

impregnating the porous ceramic layer with the polymeric one.  

 

Figure 1. Macroscopic appearance of the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds. 

Figure 2 shows the FTIR spectra of the HAp and CHT layers of the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds. The 

FTIR analysis revealed the presence of the typical bands of CHT on the upper layer namely, the 

absorption bands of the amide I and amide II groups at 1650 cm-1 and 1586 cm-1 (?), respectively [46,47]. 

On the other hand, the IR spectrum also exhibited the peaks at 900 and 1155 cm-1 (?) associated to 

saccharine structure, and aliphatic C-H stretching bands in the region of 2996-2882 cm-1 (x). The more 

intense and broad absorption band in the CHT is attributed to the N-H stretching and O-H stretching 

vibration (?) located in the spectral region of 3200-3500 cm-1.

Figure 2. FTIR spectra of HAp and CHT layers of the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds. 

Regarding the FTIR spectrum of lower layer of the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds, it were detected 

intense absorption bands at 598 and 559 cm-1 (+), and 1020 cm-1 (?), which are assigned to phosphate 

groups with the frequency of vibration ?4 and ?3, respectively. The small and sharp band observed at 

3572 cm-1 (0) corresponds to the stretching mode of hydroxyl group, which is characteristic of calcium 

phosphates such as hydroxylapatite [48]. The FTIR data showed no typical peaks of the PU sponge in 

the HAp layer after performing the heat treatments. This result is an important one, because it shows 

that no traces of PU sponge were present in the HAp layer, thus avoiding the presence of organic 

matter that somehow could be responsible for eliciting some cytotoxic effect. Therefore, this result has 

shown that by means of using the burning and sintering cycle herein described, it is possible to 

completely eliminate the ‘sacrifice matrix’ consisting of PU sponge. 

It has been reported that at temperatures higher than 1200ºC, HAp became unstable and frequently 

loses the -OH groups, and transforms in decomposition products such ?-tricalcium phosphates (TCP) 

[48,49]. When the temperature exceeds 1250ºC, it may also occur a allotropic transformation and ?-TCP 

may origin ?-TCP [48,49]. Although, in a previous work we have shown that the synthesized HAp is highly 

stable upon sintering at 1300ºC for 3 hours, i.e. no -OH group loss was detected and no phase 

transformation observed [45]. Thus, understanding the sintering behaviour of hydroxylapatite allow us to 

control the chemical composition and design a porous ceramic structure with controlled grain size, 

microstructure and mechanical properties, since sintering temperature also has a dramatic effect on

densification. Actually, it has been shown that a decrease in porosity, i.e. increase in particle 

agglomeration is accompanied by an increase in the mechanical strength, due to the homogeneity and 

more closed packed HAp grains [50].  

In this study, the XRD was also used to investigate the crystallinity and phase content of inorganic layer 

of the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds. Figure 3 shows the XRD pattern of the ceramic porous layer (on 

powder) after burning the organic template at 900ºC followed by sintering at 1300ºC for 3 hours. The 

XRD data is in good attainment with the FTIR, showing that the ceramic layer consists of highly 

crystalline form of hydroxyapaptite [51,52]. As expected, the pouring and freeze-drying of a chitosan 

solution upon the ceramic porous layer did not affect both crystallinity and phase content of the HAp.

From the SEM images shown in Figure 4, it can be seen that HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds 

microarchitecture consists of a highly porous and open pore structure. Figure 4A shows the interface of 

HAp/CHT bilayered scaffold at the surface, where it is possible to observe the two distinct porous layers. 

Figure 4B shows a typical HAp pore at the HAp/CHT interface, showing the good interpenetration of 

CHT into the HAp scaffolds. This observation suggests that a good bonding will exist between the two 

layers, which is known to be a requisite necessary to assure a good integrity and functionality of the 

osteochondral construct (scaffold+cells). Moreover, the SEM examination of the HAp scaffolds revealed 

that pores are highly interconnected and possess a size diameter in the range of 50-500 ?m (Figure 

4C).

Several authors [53,54] have shown that freezing conditions, concentration of polymer and freeze-drying 

parameters has great influence on the final microstructure and degree of interconnectivity of the 

scaffolds. Figure 4D shows the SEM micrograph of a CHT pore at the typical transversal cross-section 

of CHT layer. This study revealed that CHT pores quite resembles a typical spongy 3-D structure, with 

open pores, anisotropic porosity and pore size ranging from 20-600 ?m. It is also possible to observe 

the formation of microfibres during the freeze-drying process. This can be an advantage since these 

fibres can act as an additional anchor-framework for improved cells adhesion. Therefore, the results 

depicted in figure 4 have shown that by combining a sintering and freeze-drying technique it is possible 

to develop HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds with an adequate pore size and pore distribution for ingrowths 

of cells and diffusion of nutrients, while facilitating vascularization, and thus to be used in tissue 

engineering purposes [55,56]. Although, it is noteworthy that SEM analysis is only a reliable technique to 

obtain information about the 2-D systems, i.e. investigate the macro and micro-structure of the scaffold 

in a non-destructive way at the surface, and shows limited performance for assessing the pore 

interconnectivity of the materials.

Moreover, the scaffold should be sectioned by destructive techniques towards obtaining the detailed 

information of their inner part using the SEM, thus the original morphology of the scaffold will be 

destroyed. Therefore, in this study the 3-D architecture of the materials was investigated in a non-

destructive way, by means of using a micro-CT analysis.  

Figure 5 shows the micro-computed tomography (?-CT) analysis of the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds. A 

customized threshold technique was carried out and has shown to be effective on assessing the pore 

size and interconnectivity of CHT (Figure 5A). From the ?-CT 2-D scans it was possible to assess that 

pore size is higher than those obtained by the SEM (surface study). Actually, the inner pores of CHT 

was assessed to be up to 2 mm in length, which may be explained by the fact that ?-CT allows to study 

the inner 3-D architecture of the materials. Figure 5B shows the 2-D transversal view of the HAp 

scaffolds, which corroborated the SEM findings. These results clearly showed that the HAp pore 

network is highly interconnected. From figure 5C it became possible to observe that CHT perfectly 

interpenetrated into the HAp, thus showing the good continuity of the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffold. This 

result is encouraging since a strong mechanical interface between the HAp and CHT is required for the 

good performance of the construct.  

Previous reported results have shown that the mean porosity of the HAp scaffolds (bottom layer) of the 

HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds consisted of 67.8 ± 5.1% [45]. In this study, the percentage of porosity of 

the HAp and CHT layers were also determined (Figure 5D). The results have shown that HAp possess a 

porosity of 59.3 ± 1.7%, which is in good agreement with the previous reported data, and that CHT layer 

consisted of 74.6 ± 1.2%. Therefore, the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds have shown to possess 

adequate porosity [56] towards being used in tissue engineering scaffolding. Despite, the percentage of 

porosity at the interface was not possible to determine due to the limitation of the technique, i.e. since 

the coefficient of attenuation of HAp is much higher that that of CHT, the threshold applied for 

determining the porosity of HAp layer (T300) is different from that for assessing the porosity of CHT 

layer (T55). In fact, the observation of the dramatic lowering of porosity of CHT layer at the interface 

consists of an artefact and is a consequence of the interference of HAp layer. This data also shows that 

the overall integrity of the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds was achieved by partially impregnating the 

porous ceramic layer with the polymeric one, and is restricted to an area of 750 ?m in length. Moreover, 

the results have shown that a physical interaction is the responsible for the stability of the bilayered 

scaffolds at the interface between hydroxylapatite and chitosan. Therefore, another biopolymer that can 

be processed by freeze-drying may serve the same role as the chitosan, i.e. top layer of the bilayered 

scaffold.

To examine the mechanical properties of the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds, compression tests of the two 

layers were conducted separately, in dry conditions. The modulus (E) for the HAp and CHT in 

compression was found to be 153 ± 12 MPa and 2.9 ± 0.4 MPa, respectively. This results show that 

HAp scaffold possess quite good mechanical properties for being used in bone tissue engineering. On 

the other hand, the value for CHT scaffolds are in good attainment with those for normal human articular 

cartilage, which as been shown to have a compressive modulus ranging from 1.9 to 14.4 MPa [57,58]. 

Thus, the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds demonstrated quite promising mechanical properties for being 

used in TE of osteochondral defects. Actually, it has been shown that the biomechanical properties of 

articular cartilage greatly depends on composition, density of its ECM and interstitial fluid flow (water 

and solutes) [59]. Therefore, in wet conditions is expected a reduction of the mechanical properties. 

However, it must be noted that after implantation of the construct we expect to occur a matrix deposition 

and accumulation mediated by the cells, i.e. chondrocytes in the case of cartilage, and by this mean 

improve the mechanical function of the engineered cartilage [60].  

The capability of a scaffold to uptake and preserve the water within the structure is an important feature 

for developing suitable tissue engineering constructs for regeneration of both cartilage and 

osteochondral defects, since cartilage possesses a high content of water where oxygen and nutrients 

are dissolved. The water-uptake and weight loss of the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds was investigated 

after soaking in PBS solution at physiological pH, for 1 up to 30 days (Figure 6). From figure 6A it can 

be seen that the water uptake profile of the HAp/CHT scaffolds reach a maximum of swelling of 

approximately 65% (w/w), after 5 days. From day 5 until day 30 the water uptake capability of the 

HAp/CHT remained constant (Figure 6A). After immersion of HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds in PBS, no 

significant changes on the weight loss were observed. In fact, the weight loss profile showed that from 

day 3 until day 30, the HAp/CHT scaffolds showed a reduction in weight of approximately 0.8% (Figure 

6B). It has been demonstrated that HAp dissolves slowly, both in vitro and in vivo [61,62]. Therefore, this 

gradual weight loss should be mainly due to the slow loss of the highly hydrophilic CHT scaffold by a 

solution-mediated dissolution, i.e. leaching of the water solubles rather than HAp scaffold. A decrease in 

CHT molecular weight lowers the water-uptake and favours dissolution [63]. Thus, the overall 

performance of the HAp/CHT scaffolds may be easily tailored by using different formulations namely, 

varying the CHT molecular weight and cross-linking [41]. Nevertheless, these results are quite interesting 

since the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds have shown to have enough stability, and preserve their size 

and physical integrity. This evidences their good performance for applications in TE of osteochondral 

defects and subsequent implantation.

3.2. CYTOTOXICITY SCREENING FOR THE HAP SCAFFOLDS AND HAP/CHT BILAYERED SCAFFOLDS  

The intrinsic cytotoxicity of the HAp scaffolds and HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds was assessed by 

culturing L929 cells with extract fluids for 72 hours. As observed in an inverted microscope cells 

exhibited a normal morphology proliferated well and established a monolayer (data not shown). Figure 7 

shows the cell viability assessed by carrying out the MTS test. From results it is possible to assess that 

cells are viable in the presence of the HAp and HAp/CHT scaffold leachables. In fact, the viability levels 

are statistically similar among different HAp and HAp/CHT concentrations, reaching the maximum 

viability of ~100%. This shows that both HAp scaffolds and HAp/CHT scaffolds do not exert any 

cytotoxic effect on L929 cells. On the contrary, Latex rubber results (positive control) performed in the 

same conditions; do not overtake 1.0% of viable cells.

3.3. IN VITRO ASSESSMENT OF GBMSCS ADHESION, PROLIFERATION AND DIFFERENTIATION 

The current investigations using biodegradable implants seeded mesenchymal stem cells have shown 

to be effective on the repair of osteochondral defects, in vivo [19]. In this work, we first analysed the 

ability of the HAp porous layer to successfully support the GBMSCs adhesion and functions, in vitro 

(Phase IA). As mentioned above, when treating a osteochondral defects this ‘bone-like’ layer is aimed at 

provide the repair of the subchondral bone [64], while providing a good fixation on the underlying bone, 

during cartilage regeneration. Figure 8 shows the SEM micrographs obtained from samples resulting 

from culturing GBMSCs onto the HAp porous layer in osteogenic medium, for 14 days. It is possible to 

observe the high cellular density on the surface of the HAp porous layer, which indicates that cells 

adhered and grew favourably (Figure 8A). Additionally, it is also possible to observe that cells did not 

obstruct the pores of the scaffold at the surface (Figure 8B), and perfectly adhere, spread actively and 

presented a flatten morphology onto the surface of the biomaterial (Figure 8C). In fact, the transversal 

section analysis indicate that cells were able to penetrate deeper into the scaffold core (Figure 8D). This 

is an important observation since a good cell distribution within the whole scaffold greatly affects the

osteogenic media: surface of the cell-HAp constructs (A, B), GBMSCs infiltration into a HAp macropore 

(C), and GBMSCs on the core of the HAp scaffolds (D). 

Additionally, it is also observed the formation of cells micovilli, which is suggestive of cell activation [65]. 

In our opinion, this result is quite promising since it demonstrates that the HAp porous layer possess an 

adequate pore size and pore distribution to effectively allow the cells to adhere and maintain their 

functions. Analysis of DNA values showed a significant enhancement comparatively to initial time points 

(Figure 9).  

The cell number increased, and hence a high cellular proliferation occurred in the presence of 

osteogenic media. The DNA biochemical analysis was corroborated by MTS assay (Figure 10) showing 

that cells not only proliferated well in HAp porous layer but also were viable. These results illustrate that 

HAp porous layer is a suitable 3-D support for cellular proliferation.  

The functional activity of the GBMSCs on the HAp porous layer was determined by quantifying the ALP 

activity (Figure 11). From day 0 to day 3, cells were not cultured with osteogenic medium so, ALP levels 

refer only to basal levels of alkaline phosphatase activity in GBMSCs. Although, the higher ALP results

Figure 11. ALP activity assay of GBMSCs cultured on the HAp scaffolds. 

Figure 12 shows the immunocytochemistry preliminary results for cell-HAp scaffold constructs after 14 

days of culturing. The labelling was quite intense for osteopontin, which demonstrates that osteoblast 

differentiation was achieved in these constructs (Figure 12A). Immunolabeling for collagen type I was 

also detected, thus showing the production of collagenous matrix (Figure 12C). Therefore, this data 

confirm that GBMSCs were able to differentiate in the HAp layer after culturing in the osteogenic media 

for 14 days. 

GBMSCs seeded onto chitosan layer present a good viability and proliferation (data not showed). SEM 

micrographs show the attachment of cells possessing size and shape consistent with those of 

chondrocytes throughout the scaffolds, i.e. round chondrocyte-like cells (Figure 13). It is also possible to 

observe a good distribution of cells and maintenance of the rounded cell morphology after day 28 

(Figure 13A). At higher magnification it can also be seen the moderate cell adhesion to the substrate 

(Figure 13B), which is generally indicative of a cell performing its differentiation function [66]. Despite, cell 

numbers and penetration within scaffolds appeared to improve in areas presenting larger and 

interconnected pores. 

Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are an important component of proteoglycan and are typically present in 

the cartilaginous extracellular matrix [67]. GAGs content was determined to assess the formation of newly 

formed extracellular matrix and thus if occur the differentiation of GBMSCs into chondrocytes in these 

cell-scaffold constructs, at day 7, 21 and 28 (Figure 14). The biochemical analysis demonstrated that 

the content of GAGs increased from day 7 to day 21, indicating that occur by synthesis due to the

differentiation of the GBMSCs into the chondrogenic lineage. GAGs levels seems to be low; however it 

was not found in the literature any reference values to compare with. Nevertheless, chitosan scaffolds 

obtained by a freeze-drying technique suggested being a suitable 3-D support for chondrogenic 

differentiation of GBMSCs, and their maintenance over a period of 28 days.

Future studies will be designed to investigate the capacity of the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds to favour 

simultaneous but independent osteoblasts and chondrocytes proliferation and differentiation upon 

seeding GBMSCs, leading to the formation of adequate tissue substitutes for the regeneration of 

osteochondral defects (Phase II). This will be achieved using a culturing system such as the ones 

proposed by Wendt et al. [68], which are specifically designed for this purpose and allow to culture 

simultaneously the HAp and CHT layers in separate culture medium that will direct cell differentiation 

into the required phenotypes.

4. CONCLUSIONS 

This work demonstrates the feasibility to prepare hydroxylapatite/chitosan bilayered scaffolds by means 

of an innovative method that combines a sintering and a freeze-drying technique. The novel 3-D 

macroporous hydroxylapatite/chitosan bilayered scaffolds exhibit physicochemical properties that 

appear to make them a suitable candidate to be used as a supportive structure for cells functions. 

Moreover, the in vitro cell culture studies demonstrated that both HAp and CHT layers provide an 

adequate 3-D support for the attachment, proliferation and differentiation of GBMSCs into osteoblasts 

and chondrocytes, respectively. The HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds are advantageous by several reasons 

namely, they can be designed with several sizes and controlled architecture to fit patient specific injuries 

and cell functions, respectively. The HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds showed promising biological 

behaviour and may therefore find applications in tissue engineering of bone and osteochondral defects.

CHAPTER VI.  

Surface engineered carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles for 

intracellular targeting  

Abstract 

Novel highly branched biodegradable macromolecular systems were developed by grafting 

carboxymethylchitosan, CMCht onto low generation poly(amidoamine), PAMAM dendrimers. Such 

structures were organized into sphere-like nanoparticles that are proposed to be used as carriers to 

deliver bioactive molecules aimed at controlling the behaviour of stem cells, namely their proliferation 

and differentiation. The nanoparticles did not exhibit significant cytotoxicity in the range of 

concentrations below 1 mg.mL-1 and fluorescent probe labeled nanoparticles were found to be 

internalized with highly efficiency by both human osteoblast-like cells and rat bone marrow stromal cells, 

under fluorescence-activated cell sorting and fluorescence microscopy analyses. Dexamethasone (Dex) 

was incorporated CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and release rates were determined by high 

performance liquid chromatography. Moreover, the biochemical data demonstrated that the Dex-loaded 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles promote the osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow 

stromal cells, in vitro. The nanoparticles exhibited interesting physicochemical and biological properties 

and have great potential to be used in fundamental cell biology studies as well as in a variety of 

biomedical applications, including tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Dendrimers are a relatively new class of synthetic [1,2], highly branched, nanospherical and low 

dispersive macromolecules [3,4]. They can be designed to provide a quite versatile choice of external 

functional groups in order to reduce cytotoxicity and enhance transepithelial transport [5,6], for interaction 

with coupling molecules such as natural-based polymers [7] and fluorescent probes [8] and an inner 

hydrophobic core where other molecules can be trapped [6]. Among myriad possibilities, dendrimers can 

find applications as a delivery carrier of drugs [6,9] and DNA (transfection) [10], imaging agents [11,12], and 

tissue engineering scaffolding [13]. Although there are different routes to synthesise dendrimers [4], their 

maximum size is typically in the order of ~10-20 nm [12,14]. Moreover, it has also been found [15] that high 

generation dendrimers (G7) with amine capping-groups causes haemolysis and changes in red cell 

morphology, and in general are overall cytotoxic. Therefore, the strategy proposed herein envisions the 

surface engineering of a dendrimer core grafted to natural-based and biocompatible polymers (linear 

polymer chains) in order to obtain copolymers of new architectures with tuned nanoparticle size and 

more versatile macromolecules. These should make it possible to avoid the cytotoxic effects of high-

generation dendrimers. This new class of materials is expected to exhibit entirely new properties since 

the structures might have sizes larger than 10 nm and different surface properties (dendronized 

polymer) [1]. It is expected that the dendronized polymers developed in the present work will have 

potential applications as novel drug or gene delivery carriers for targeting certain tissues or cell cultures. 

Such nano-devices could display a higher loading capacity, and allow the bulk incorporation of bioactive 

molecules of higher molecular weights and of different chemistry, while maintaining high internalization 

and transfection efficiency as compared to conventional dendrimers.  

In this study, novel water-soluble nanoparticles consisting of a poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer 

core with grafted carboxymethylchitosan (CMCht) chains (dendronized polymer) were successfully 

synthesized. They were then characterized and screened for cytotoxicity using a fibroblast-cell line 

(L929) and rat bone marrow stromal Cells (RBMSCs) by means of performing a tetrazolium reduction 

(MTT) assay and luminescent cell viability assay based on the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) 

quantification, respectively. The internalization of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles was also investigated using both osteoblastic-cell line     

(SaOs-2) and RBMSCs as target cells. These types of cells are widely used in tissue engineering 

approaches [16,17] and are simple in vitro systems for assessing the internalization efficiency of 

fluorescent-labeled  molecules. It is our particular interest to engineer these nanoparticles to find

applications in the intracellular controlled delivery of biological agents, including differentiation factors or 

genetic material, to modulate stem cell behaviour while avoiding undesired secondary effects. In this 

context, it was also investigated the capacity of dexamethasone-loaded CMCht/PAMAM nanoparticles 

to promote the osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells. Alizarin red and ALP 

stainings were carried out to assess qualitatively the mineralization capacity and ALP activity, which are 

known to denote the osteogenic differentiation. The quantitative content of ALP and osteocalcin, the 

early and late markers of osteogenic differentiation respectively, were also determined. 

2. EXPERIMENTAL  

2.1. SYNTHESIS OF THE CMCHT/PAMAM NANOPARTICLES 

Carboxymethylchitosan with a degree of deacetylation of 80% and degree of substitution of 47% was 

synthesized by a chemical modification route of chitin (Sigma, Germany) as described by Chen et al. [18]. 

Starburst® poly(amidoamine)-carboxylic terminated dendrimers, PAMAM-CT (generation 1.5, 20% (w/v) 

methanolic solution) with an ethylenediamine core were purchased from Aldrich. 

Carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer, CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were 

prepared in a stepwise manner as follows: (i) increasing the generation of the PAMAM-CT (G 1.5), (ii) 

obtaining a PAMAM-methyl ester terminated dendrimer, (iii) reaction of PAMAM and CMCht, i.e. the 

reaction goes through a condensation reaction between the methyl ester and amine groups [19], and (iv) 

modifying the methyl ester groups that do not react to carboxylic ones in the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer, 

followed by precipitation. Firstly, the increase of the dendrimers’ generation was carried out as follows: 

an appropriate volume of PAMAM-CT (G 1.5) in methanol was transferred to a 2 mL volumetric flask 

and the solvent evaporated off under nitrogen gas, and the traces dried under vacuum in order to 

completely remove the methanol. The starting compound was re-dissolved in ultra-pure water to give a 

final concentration of 10 mg.mL-1 and the pH was adjusted to 6.5 with dilute hydrochloric acid solution, 

HCl (Riedel de-Haen, Germany) solution. Then, 1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide 

hydrochloride, EDC (Fluka, Slovakia) was added to the solution at a molar ratio sufficient to modify the 

carboxylate residue of the dendrimers and kept under agitation for 30 min at room temperature. 

Ethylenediamine, EDA (Sigma, Germany) was added to the solution at a molar ratio equal to that of 

EDC and let react for at least 4 hrs. After this period the exceeding EDC was removed by dialysis 

(cellulose tubing, benzoylated for separating compounds with a molecular weight of ? 1,200 from 

compounds with a molecular weight &gt; 2,000, Sigma, Germany). The compound was used without

purification in the next step. After preparing the PAMAM-amine terminated compound, PAMAM-AT, an 

exhaustive alkylation of primary amines (Michael addition) was carried [20]. An appropriate volume of 

PAMAM-AT (~8.4 mmol) was transferred to a 50 mL flask and 30 mL of methanol (Sigma, Germany), 

and 1.14 mL of methyl methacrylate (~12.6 mmol) (Fluka, Germany) were added. The solution was kept 

under agitation in a water bath for 24 hrs at 50ºC, to obtain the compound (PAMAM-methyl ester). The 

carboxymethylchitosan (100 mg) dissolved in ultrapure water (10 mL) was mixed with the latter obtained 

PAMAM-methyl ester dendrimer (50 mg), which was previously dissolved in a 20/80 water/methanol 

(v/v) solution. The final solution was diluted by adding 30 mL of methanol and kept under agitation for 72 

hrs. After this period, CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer with carboxylic-terminated groups were obtained as 

described elsewhere [19]. CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were then precipitated after addition 

of an appropriate volume of a saturated sodium carbonate, Na2CO3 (Aldrich, Germany) solution and 

acetone (Pronalab, Portugal). On the other hand CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were mixed 

with a dexamethasone solution with a final concentration of 5 x 10-4 M under agitation (w/w). The 

mixture was then added to the precipitation media consisting of a saturated sodium carbonate, Na2CO3 

(Aldrich, Germany) and acetone solution, under vigorous agitation. Precipitates were collected by 

filtration and dispersed in ultrapure water for dialysis during the period of 48 hrs. Both CMCht/PAMAM 

and dexamethasone-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were obtained by freezing the 

solution at -80ºC and freeze-drying (Telstar-Cryodos -80, Spain) up to 4 d to complete remove the 

solvent. It is noteworthy that the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles are water-soluble at 

physiological pH. 

2.2. LABELING OF CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES WITH FITC  

A 10 mg.mL-1 fluorescein isothiocyanate, FITC (Sigma, Germany) solution was prepared in dimethyl 

sulfoxide, DMSO anhydrous (Riedel de-Haen) (dark conditions). Conjugates of CMCht/PAMAM-FITC 

were prepared by covalently bonding the amine group of carboxymethylchitosan and the isothyocianate 

group of FITC (thiourea bond). Firstly, a 10 mg.mL-1 CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles solution 

was prepared in a carbonate-bicarbonate coupling buffer of pH 9.2. Then, 50 ?L of the FITC/DMSO 

solution was added per each mL of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles buffered solution under 

agitation, and kept in dark at 4ºC for 8 hrs. The FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles 

solution was dialyzed against ultra-pure water in order to remove unlinked FITC for 24 hrs and filtered 

(pore size &amp;lt;220 nm) in sterile and dark conditions. The final product was obtained as an orange powder 

after freeze-drying. The labelling efficiency was investigated by Fourier-transform infra-red, FTIR

spectroscopy (Perkin-Elmer 1600 series equipment, USA) and UV-VIS spectrophotometry (NanoDropTM 

ND-1000; NanoDrop Technologies, USA). 

2.3. CHARACTERIZATION OF THE CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES 

Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) analyses were performed by means of preparing transparent 

potassium bromide pellets containing the samples and using a Perkin-Elmer spectroscope (Perkin-

Elmer 1600 series equipment, UK).  

The morphology of the nanoparticles was investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The 

lyophilized CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were dispersed in ultrapure water to obtain a 

solution with final concentration of 1 mg.mL-1, and then 20 ?L was placed over a 9.9 mm mica disc 

(Agar Scientific, England) and blown dried with nitrogen gas for subsequent characterization. The 

samples were analysed using the Tapping Mode™ with a MultiMode AFM connected to a NanoScope III 

controller, both from Veeco, USA, with non-contact silicon nanoprobes (ca 300 kHz) from Nanosensors, 

Switzerland. All images were plane-fitted using the third degree-flatten procedure included in the 

NanoScope software version 4.43r8. The particle size distribution was determined with the same 

software. The morphology and size of the particles was further analysed by transmission electron 

microscopy, TEM (Philips CM-12, FEI Company, The Netherlands, equipped with a MEGA VIEW-II 

DOCU camera and Image Software Analyzer SIS NT DOCU). The nanoparticles were stained with 2% 

of phosphotungstic acid and placed on copper grids for further observation. The size of the 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles was also measured in a particle size analyzer (Zetasizer Nano 

ZS, Malvern Instruments, UK). 

2.4. IN VITRO CYTOTOXICITY SCREENING OF THE CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES 

A luminescent cell viability assay based on the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) quantification was 

performed by exposing Rat Bone Marrow Stromal Cells (RBMSCs) to CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles. Prior to the cell culture studies CMCht, PAMAM-CT G 1.5, and CMCht/PAMAM 

nanoparticles were sterilized under an ethylene oxide gas atmosphere. RBMSCs were isolated from 

femora of 7 week-old male Fischer 344/N rats (SLC Inc. Japan), and expanded in T75 cm2 culture flasks 

in the presence of Eagle’s minimum essential medium (MEM, Nacalai Tesque, Japan) with 15% fetal 

bovine serum, FBS (JRH Biosciences, USA) and 1 % antibiotic-antimycotic (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) 

solution. The animals were sacrificed by administrating an excess of anesthesia, in accordance to the 

Ethics Committee at the Tissue Engineering Research Center (Amagasaki, Japan). After reaching 



CHAPTER VI. Surface engineered carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles for intracellular targeting 

 
 

- 231 - 
 
 

confluency, the cells (passage 1, P1) were released from substratum and centrifuged at 900 rpm for 5 

min. The supernatant was aspirated and cells re-suspended with 10 mL of complete culture medium. 

Cell concentration was determined using an automatic cell counter (Cell Counter Sysmex F-520, 

Japan). Viability of the RBMSCs was also analyzed with a NucleoCounter (Chemometec, Denmark), 

using prior seeding as described elsewhere [21]. RBMSCs were seeded (sub-cultured) to each well of a 

96-well TCPS plate at a cell density of 5 x 103 cells.mL-1. A solution of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles at a concentration of 10 mg.mL-1 was prepared in a complete culture medium. Serial 

dilutions (1, 0.1, 0.01 mg.mL-1) were further prepared using the complete culture medium. Possible 

changes in the osmolality of the culture media were investigated using an automatic cryoscopic 

osmometer (OSMOMAT O 30-D, Gonotec, Germany). After a period of 24 hrs, the culture medium was 

changed by the respective serial dilutions and the cells cultured under standard culture conditions for 1 

and 3 d. A latex rubber extract was used as the positive control for cellular death. Finally, the ATP 

content was measured by means of performing a CellTiter-Glo® luminescent cell viability assay, 

following the protocol provided by the supplier (Promega Corporation, USA). Luminescence was 

measured using opaque-walled multi-well plate in a microplate reader (Wallac ARVOsx 1420, Perkin-

Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, USA). Results were analyzed for statistical significance using 

Student’s t-test with the JMP 5.0.1 software (SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.). 

2.5. INVESTIGATION OF THE INTERNALIZATION EFFICIENCY USING SAOS-2 CELLS AND RBMSCS UNDER 

FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY AND FACS ANALYSIS 

Human osteoblast-like cells (SaOs-2 cells, ECACC, UK) were maintained in T75 cm2 culture flasks, 

cultured with basic culture medium - DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% A/B, and passaged 

after reaching confluence. A cell suspension was prepared and seeded on TCPS coverslips (Sarstedt 

Inc., USA) in 24-well plates (1 x 104 cells.well-1) and cultured in standard culture conditions for 24 hrs. 

The internalization of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles by SaOs-2 cells was assessed after 3, 

12, 24 hrs, and 14 d. After each time point cells on the TCPS coverslips were fixed with 4% formalin 

(Sigma, Germany) and the nuclei stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dilactate, DAPI blue (100 

ng.mL-1; Molecular Probes), for assessing possible cell morphological changes. Fluorescence was 

protected by using an antifade agent (ProLong® Antifade Kit, Invitrogen, USA), following the supplier 

procedure and cells were observed under the fluorescence microscope (AxioImager Z1, Zeiss Inc., 

Germany).

RBMSCs were isolated from rats and expanded until reaching 80% of confluency. The RBMSCs (P1) 

were trypsinized and transferred to a 6-well (1 x 105 cells.well-1) and a TCPS coverslips in 24-well TCPS 

plates (2 x 104 cells.well-1) for analysis under FACS and fluorescence microscopy, respectively. For 

fluorescence microscopy, RBMSCs were cultured in a MEM complete culture medium containing the 0.1 

mg.mL-1 FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles for a period of 12 hrs until 14 d. For 

FACS analysis RBMSCs were cultured in the presence of 0.01 mg.mL-1 FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles. All experiments were carried out in triplicate. The samples for fluorescence 

microscopy were prepared as follows: each well was washed with 1 mL of PBS, and cells fixed with 4% 

formalin (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) for 10 min at 4ºC followed by washing each well twice with PBS. After 

that cells were incubated with 0.5 mL of PBS containing Texas Red?-X phalloidin (Molecular Probes, 

Invitrogen, USA) and Hoechst 33258 (Invitrogen, USA) for staining the actin filaments of the 

cytoskeleton and nuclei of cells, respectively. The protocols provided by the supplier were followed with 

few modifications. The permeabilization of cells with Triton? X-100 was not carried out to avoid any 

undesired effect over the integrity of cells nuclei. TCPS coverslips were washed once with PBS and 

fluorescence protected using the ProLong® antifade kit. The specimens were observed under a 

fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX70, Olympus Co. Ltd., Japan). FACS analysis was carried out as 

follows: each well of the 6-well plate was washed with 2 mL of PBS. Then, PBS was aspirated and cells 

released from substratum as described above. Afterwards, it was added to each well 3.5 mL of MEM 

complete medium and samples transferred to a 15 mL Falcon. After centrifugation at 900 rpm for 5 min, 

cells were re-suspended in 0.5 mL of complete culture medium and passed through cell strainers [22]. 

Afterwards, 1 ?L propidium iodide (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) was added to each sample for determining 

the number of live cells. After this step, cells were loaded in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD 

Biosciences Imunocytometry Systems, USA) and analyzed with a minimum of 10,000 events counting. 

Calibrite beads three-color kit (BD CaliBRITETM beads, USA) was used to adjust the equipment 

instrument settings before samples are run on the flow cytometer. Finally, the fluorescence-activated 

cell sorting (FACS) data was treated using the FLOWJO software. 

2.6. INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFECT OF COLCHICINE AND APYRASE ON THE INTERNALIZATION EFFICIENCY OF 

FITC-LABELED CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES BY RBMSCS 

A cell suspension of RBMSCs (P1) in MEM complete culture medium was transferred to a 6-well           

(1 x 105 cells.well-1) and TCPS coverslips in 24-well TCPS plates (2 x 104 cells.well-1) for analysis under 

FACS and fluorescence microscopy, respectively. Stock solutions of 10 U.mL-1 apyrase (Nacalai

Tesque, Japan) and 10 µM colchicine (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) were prepared in a phosphate-buffered 

saline solution. Cells were incubated in standard culture conditions and after 24 hrs, the culture medium 

was replaced by a different complete culture medium containing the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles (0.01 mg.mL-1 and 0.1 mg.mL-1), and in the presence of 1 µM colchicine and 

0.1 U.mL-1 apyrase or both, for a period of 12 hrs to 14 d. Controls for internalization were performed by 

culturing RBMSCs in complete culture medium and in the presence of both colchicine and apyrase. All 

experiments were carried out in triplicate. After each time period, specimens were prepared as 

described previously. The tendency of FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles to be 

internalized by RBMSCs was investigated by means of FACS analysis.  

2.7. INVESTIGATION OF THE DEXAMETHASONE RELEASE FROM CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES 

The amounts of Dex from nanoparticles were measured using an HPLC (ASI-Knauer, Germany) with an 

UV detector set at 246 nm. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile:acetate buffer (2 mM, pH 4.8-

adjusted with glacial acetic acid) (50:50 v/v) at flow-rate of 1 mL.min-1. In brief, Dex release was studied 

after dissolution of 10 mg of Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles in 10 mL of 

phosphate buffer saline, PBS (pH 7.4, Sigma, USA) solution in the absence or presence of 15% FBS. 

Sodium azide 0.01% (wt/v, Merck, Germany) was added to the buffer. The in vitro release studies were 

performed at 37?C and 60 rpm for times ranging from 1 h until 7 d. At set time intervals, 1 mL of sample 

was taken for analysis and the same volume replaced by the respective buffer solution. Prior analysis, 

samples were centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 10 min. Samples were analyzed by means of preparing a 

solution with 1:1 (sample:acetonitrile:acetate buffer, 50:25:25 v/v). A Eurospher 100 C-18 analytical 

column (ASI-Knauer, Germany) was used. The retention time of Dex was 4 min. A calibration curve was 

obtained following the method described by Sun et al. [23]. Results were expressed as an average ± 

standard deviation, n=6. 

2.8. EVALUATION OF OSTEOGENIC DIFFERENTIATION OF THE RBMSCS CULTURED IN THE PRESENCE OF 

CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES LOADED WITH DEXAMETHASONE, IN VITRO 

RBMSCs were isolated from F344/N rats and expanded as described above. RBMSCs (P1) were 

cultured in a TCPS 24-well plate at a cell density of 2 x 104 cells.well-1, and cultured in a complete MEM 

medium for 24 hrs. After that time, culture medium was replaced by the different culture media, and 

RBMSCs cultured for times up to 14 d. The effect of the concentration of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles loaded with dexamethasone on the RBMSCs osteogenic differentiation was investigated. 



CHAPTER VI. Surface engineered carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles for intracellular targeting 

 

 
 
- 234 - 
 
 

Dexamethasone-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were dissolved in MEM medium 

supplemented with 0.28 mM ascorbic acid (Wako Pure Chemicals, Japan) and 10 mM                          

?-glycerophosphate (Sigma, USA) at a final concentration of 0.01 and 1 mg.mL-1. RBMSCS were also 

cultured in a complete MEM medium, complete MEM medium containing 1 mg.mL-1 of CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles, and complete MEM medium containing 10 mM ?-glycerophosphate (negative 

controls). Complete MEM medium supplemented with 10-8 M dexamethasone, 0.28 mM ascorbic acid 

and 10 mM ?-glycerophosphate was used as the positive control for osteogenic differentiation. Culture 

media were changed every 2-3 d. All experiments were carried out 3 times using a minimum of 4 

replicates per experimental condition.  

Alizarin red S staining was performed to investigate possible calcium deposition after 14 d of culturing. 

RBMSCs were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 95% ethanol for 15 min. The fixed cells were then 

washed once with PBS and stained with 5 mg.mL-1 Alizarin red S in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. 

Then, it followed a washing step with ultra-pure water and mounting with Crystal/MountTM 

(BiomedaCorporation, USA) for observation under the phase contrast microscope (Olympus CK40, 

Olympus Co. Ltd., Japan). 

For the ALP staining the cells were washed twice the wells with PBS, after each culture period. Cells 

were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) for 15 min at 4ºC and then washed twice 

with AMP buffer (56 mM of 2-amino-2methyl-1,3-propanediol in ultrapure water, pH 9.9). It followed the 

soaking step with staining solution 0.5 mg naphtol AS-MX phosphate and 0.5 mg fast red violet LB salt 

per mL, in AMP buffer. Cells were incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature, washed with PBS and 

mounted (BiomedaCorporation, USA) for observation under the phase contrast microscope. 

DNA quantification was performed using Hoechst 33258 (Nacalai Tesque, Japan), as previously 

described elsewhere [24].  

Alkaline phosphatase was measured to evaluate osteoblast differentiation. The samples used for DNA 

quantification assay were used to determine ALP levels. Prior to analysis the samples were centrifuged 

at 10,000 rpm for 1 min at 4?C. To each well of a 96-well plate was added an aliquot of supernatant and 

p-nytrophenyl phosphate substrate (ZYMED® Laboratories, Invitrogen, USA). The plate was then 

incubated in the dark for 30 min at 37ºC. After the incubation period, the reaction was stopped with 1 M 

NaOH (Panreac). Standards were prepared with p-nytrophenol, pNP. Triplicates were made for each 

sample and standard. Absorbance was read at 405 nm (Wallac ARVOsx 1420, Perkin-Elmer Life and 

Analytical Sciences, USA), and sample concentrations were read off from the standard graph. Enzyme 

activity was expressed either as nmol of pNP released/well/30 min and normalized by DNA content. 



CHAPTER VI. Surface engineered carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles for intracellular targeting 

 
 

- 235 - 
 
 

The samples used for ALP activity were treated with a 20% formic acid solution immediately after 

concluding the assay and stored at 4?C for 2-3 d. Then, samples were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 

min at 4?C and the supernatant passed through a SephadexTM G-25 column (GE healthcare, Sweden) 

for desalting. The filtered samples were concentrated in a SPD SpeedVac® equipment attached to a UV 

Vacuum System (Thermo Electron Corporation, USA), prior to osteocalcin quantification. Finally, the 

osteocalcin content was determined by performing an Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and using 

a Rat Osteocalcin EIA kit (N? BT-460, Biomedical Technologies Inc., USA). The experimental procedure 

was carried out following the instructions provided by the supplier. A 100 ng.mL-1 standard solution of 

human osteocalcin was used to construct the standard curve. Data was read off from the standard 

graph and expressed as ng of deposited osteocalcin per ?g of DNA. 

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

3.1. CHARACTERIZATION OF THE CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES 

Figure 1 shows FTIR spectra of the PAMAM-CT dendrimers, CMCht and CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles. The results suggest that CMCht was successfully synthesized, as evidenced by the 

presence of characteristic absorption bands of the carboxyl group (?) at 1593 cm-1 and (?) 1420 cm-1 

(?as COO- and ?s COO-). The characterization of molecular levels conjugate obtained by coupling 

reaction of CMCht with PAMAM dendrimer was investigated by FTIR analysis. We were able to detect 

characteristic absorption bands of groups attributed to both CMCht and PAMAM dendrimer structure in 

the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. There is an increase in intensity of the bands at 1570 and 

1200 cm-1 (?) attributed to the Amide II and C-N stretching vibrations, which is evidence that substituted 

amines are present and there is possible chemical bonding between the CMCht and PAMAM. The 

effective degree of conjugation, measured by 1H and 13C NMR will be reported in a future work.  

Some studies have been shown that PAMAM are hydrolytically degradable due to their amide 

skeletons, and hydrolysis occurs slowly at physiological temperatures [25]. On the other hand, chitosan 

and its derivatives have been shown to possess bonds that are enzyme substrates [26]. Thus, the 

surface engineering of dendrimers as proposed herein may enable obtain macromolecules with a 

different hydrolytic degradability, releasing also nontoxic products. As a consequence, the nanoparticles 

may show entirely new drug delivery profiles and elimination rates. In preliminary degradation studies, a 

decrease was observed in the intensity of the band at 1655-1630 cm-1 (*), which corresponds to amide I 

(n C=O) of the PAMAM dendrimer (see supporting information). Decreases were also detected in the

band at 1200 cm-1 (?) that corresponds to the C-N stretching vibration of the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles, and also those at 1155 and 900 cm-1 (?) attributed to the saccharine structure of CMCht. 

On the other hand, increased intensities of peaks attributed to the CH stretching bands (x) and N-H 

stretching vibrations (+) are observed. These preliminary data support the idea that the CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles are hydrolytically degradable at physiological temperature and pH, due to 

dissociation of their amide and glycosidic linkages. It has been shown that the architecture of 

nanoparticles strongly dictates the mechanisms and kinetics by which they are internalized by             

cells [27-28].

Gao et al. [27] have recently demonstrated that the optimal cellular uptake of particles by endocytosis 

occurs with particles having diameters of ~50 nm. On the other hand, the mechanism of internalization 

of particles with larger diameters occurs preferentially by phagocytosis [27]. An AFM image of the 

CMCht/PAMAM nanoparticles is shown in Figure 2A. AFM characterization clearly demonstrated that 

the synthesized macromolecules consistently exhibit nanosphere-like shapes. It was also found that the 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles could be uniformly dispersed on a substrate by spreading a 

solution of dendronized polymers on a freshly cleaved mica surface and drying under a nitrogen gas 

stream. The results of a morphometric analysis by AFM indicated that the nanoparticles have an 

average diameter of 26 nm (dry state) and average total area of ~2123 nm2. These data were 

corroborated by TEM observations. In Figures 2B-C it is possible to visualize the CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles in a greater detail. Additionally, it is also observed that the nanoparticles can 

form aggregates (Figure 2D).

Carboxymethylchitosan with a degree of deacetylation (DA) of 80% and degree of substitution of 47% 

was used in the synthesis of the CMCht/PAMAM nanoparticles. Chitosan with high degree of acetylation 

is insoluble in water because the acetylated units can be involved in intramolecular hydrogen linkages, 

which in part explain the insolubility of chitosan in water [22]. Nevertheless, the modifications of amino 

groups with carboxylic-ones allowed us to obtain CMCht, a water soluble chitosan derivate. Using 

potentiometric titration it was possible to verify that the precipitation of CMCht occurred preferentially in 

a pH range from ~2-6 (data not shown). Thus, CMCht possesses protonated amino groups at pH 2, and 

negative COO- ions at physiological pH. In other words, at physiological pH the CMCht behaves as a 

weak polyanionic polyelectrolyte, i.e. the amino groups are not protonated and most of carboxyl groups 

are not dissociated. Interactions between non-covalent free carboxyl groups of CMCht and/or     

PAMAM-CT dendrimer and amino groups of other CMCht particles are possible to occur, which may 

explain the formation of nanoparticle aggregates. It is noteworthy that Zhu et al. [30] proposed the use of 

CMCht aggregates for the effective loading and controlled release of drugs. On the other hand, during 

the synthesis of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimers nanoparticles there are several binding points available, 

onto which possible cross-linking reactions may occur. This may also explain the formation of 

nanoparticle aggregations. Nanoparticles aggregation might be prevented or minimized by optimizing 

the concentrations of both CMCht and PAMAM. 

Figure 3 shows the data obtained from the particle size distribution analysis of the different 

nanoparticles in solution. Figure 3A shows the low dispersivity of the PAMAM-CT (G 1.5) dendrimers 

used in the synthesis of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. These nanoparticles have a diameter 

of 2 ? 1 nm, which is in agreement with previously reported data [31]. After the synthesis of the 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles, three kinds of particulate structures could be detected with 

sizes of approximately 6 ? 2 nm, 45 ? 15 nm and 250 ? 100 nm (Figure 3B). The first peak has an 

intensity of 5.5% and should correspond to the modified dendrimer. The second (36.2%) corresponds to 

the isolated CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles, and the third (58.2%) to the aggregated 

nanoparticles. Mammalian cells are sensitive to the osmolality of the ambient medium, and variations on 

this property may affect cell morphology and cell growth.  It is known that most cell culture mediums are 

produced to have a osmolality in the range of 270-330 mOsm.kg-1, since these values are acceptable 

for most cells [32]. In this study, MEM medium supplemented with FBS and A/B (standard) with an 

osmolality of 310 ± 2 mOsm.kg-1 was used. The effect of the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles 

on the osmolality of culture media was also investigated, since the addition of medium concentrates 



CHAPTER VI. Surface engineered carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles for intracellular targeting

may increase the osmolality of the media. The osmolality of the culture medium containing nanoparticles 

at a concentration ranging from 0.01 to 1 mg.mL-1 was assessed to be 315 ± 2 mOsm.kg-1. It was 

observed that varying the concentration of the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles did not 

significantly change the osmolality of media, which indicates that the cells are not cultured under 

osmotic stress.

3.2. CYTOTOXICITY SCREENING 

The cell viability in this work was preliminarily screened by performing a MTT test, which is a quite 

reliable method for assessing cytotoxicity [33,34]. A L929 fibroblast cell line was exposed to different 

concentrations of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles over a period of 24 hrs (see supporting 

information). Two polymers, water-soluble carboxymethylchitosan (linear polymer) and PAMAM-CT       

G1.5 (spherical polymer), were selected for a comparative study considering the fact that 

biocompatibility is thought to be influenced by various characteristics including the polymer molecular 

weight, concentration, structure (linear, branched, cross-linked), surface charge density and                

flexibility [33,35-37]. Results indicate that dendronized polymers at concentrations of 0.01 mg.mL-1, and    

0.1 mg.mL-1 do not induce any toxicity for the investigated culturing times. However, for a concentration 

of 1 mg.mL-1, after 24 hrs the viability of the L929 cells decreased in the presence of CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles, which suggests moderate cytotoxic effects. These results agree with previous

studies where the concentration was reported to affect the biocompatibility of polymers to a certain 

extent [33,37]. Moreover, our findings are also consistent with previous ones indicating that high molecular 

weight structures may exhibit more serious cytotoxic effects [33]. However, such trends are meaningful 

only when the same type of polymer is compared.  

Figure 4 shows the luminescent cell viability assay that was carried out after culturing the RBMSCs in 

the presence of different concentrations of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles for 24 and 72 hrs. 

This assay is a homogeneous method based on the quantification of ATP and thus a more feasible test 

for assessing the cytotoxicity of materials, since it signals the presence of metabolically active cells. The 

luminescence signal is proportional to the amount of ATP, which in turn is directly proportional to the 

number of cells in the culture medium. Statistically, it is possible to observe that increasing 

concentrations of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles did not affect the viability (ATP content) of 

RBMSCs, after 24 hrs (p &gt; 0.05).

When culturing the RBMSCs in a MEM medium and in the presence of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles, a statistical increase in viability was observed from 24 to 72 hrs (p &amp;lt;0.0001). A statistical 

difference on the viability of RBMSCs was not seen when culturing RBMSCs in the presence of MEM 

and CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles in the range of concentrations between 0.01 and 0.1 

mg.mL-1, after 72 hrs (p &gt; 0.05). However, the viability of RBMSCs decreased in 8.5% when culturing in 

the presence of 1 mg.mL-1 CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles (p &amp;lt;0.05) as compared to control. 

The latex extracts (positive control) have shown a high cytotoxic effect over RBMSCs as seen by the 

low luminescence values after 24 and 72 hrs. These results demonstrate that RBMSCs remain viable in 

the presence of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles at concentrations &amp;lt;1 mg.mL-1. Similar data 

was observed on the viability of L929 cells, which provides further evidence of the low cytotoxic effects 

of the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles in the range of concentrations &amp;lt;1 mg.mL-1. 

3.3. INTERNALIZATION EFfiCIENCY OF THE CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES  

Several studies [5,9,38,39] have been performed to clarify the entry and retention mechanisms of 

nanoparticles on mammalian cells as well as to investigate cells death [40]. For instance, it has been 

reported [5] that the cationic surface charge of particles is responsible for their interactions with the 

anionic glycoproteins and phospholipids of the cell membrane surface, possibilitating the internalization. 

In the present case, it is expected that these types of interactions are responsible for the entry of 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles into the cell cytosol, either by passive transport caused 

through perturbations of the membrane or by endocytosis [5]. After being trapped within the endosome, 

the nanoparticles must be released into the cytosol before being subjected to acidic and/or enzymatic 

degradation. Nevertheless, due to the presence of protonated residues in the chain of the CMCht, which 

has a buffer capacity, it is expected that these nanoparticles can retard the degradation caused by 

acidification or enzymatic degradation within the endosomes. Theoretically, when loaded with drugs or 

DNA this type of nanocarriers may increase the availability of drugs inside the cells or the transfection 

efficiency. In this study, the internalization and intracellular end-condition of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles were investigated by grafting a fluorescent label probe (FITC). This study was firstly 

performed using a SaOs-2 cell line and later on RBMSCs. Figure 5 shows the fluorescence microscopy 

images of SaOs-2 cells cultured in the presence of FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles. The nanoparticles tested in this experiment consisted of the fraction of the total with size 

&amp;lt;220 nm, which was easily obtained by a filtration technique. It is apparent that CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles (green) were present at the SaOs-2 cells membrane walls only in low numbers 



CHAPTER VI. Surface engineered carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles for intracellular targeting 

 

 
 
- 242 - 
 
 

after 3 hrs (white arrows), but in increasing amounts after a period of 12 hrs (Figures 5A-B). However, 

after 24 hrs it is clearly seen that CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were internalized and widely 

distributed in the cytoplasm of SaOs-2 cells (Figure 5C). Moreover, there is also evidence of the 

presence of nanoparticles in the cell nuclei, as observed by the colocalization of the nuclei marker (blue) 

and FITC fluorescence (green). Cells continued to internalize the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles (higher fluorescent signals) when cultured for longer periods of time, retaining their 

proliferation rate and remaining viable (Figure 5D).

labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles 1 mg.mL-1 (green) for: A) 3 hrs, B) 12 hrs, C) 24 hrs, 

and D) 14 d. Nuclear DNA was labeled with DAPI (blue). 

A typical feature of apoptosis is the presence of chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation [35]. 

Apoptosis can be detected by nuclear morphology after staining with DAPI blue or Hoechst 33258, for 

example. In Figures 5C-D, it is seen that SaOs-2 exhibited a normal size and round nuclei with 

homogeneous chromatin. Microscopic observations during the course of cell culturing in the presence of 

FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles showed no morphological changes or cellular 

senescence, which is a good indication of cell survival. On the other hand, significant cell death was

detected after 24 hrs for a culture of SaOs-2 cells in media containing FITC (control). These results also 

highlight the fact that the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles are quite stable, since 

their fluorescence was maintained over a period of 14 d. The fact that internalization of the 

nanoparticles was not well observed after 3 hrs can be attributed to the rather high detection limit of the 

fluorescence microscope. FACS analysis was performed towards circumventing this limitation. In this 

analysis, primary cultures and FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles at a concentration 

of 0.01 mg.mL-1 were used. This concentration is impossible to detect by fluorescence microscopy and 

therefore makes a good test case for FACS. 

Figure 6 shows the results of FACS analysis after culturing the RBMSCs in the presence of the FITC-

labeled  CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles for times up to 14 d. Flow-cytometry studies revealed 

increasing levels of fluorescence associated with cells after incubation of RBMSCs with CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles for the period of 12 hrs to 7 d. The present data show that nanoparticles were 

internalized with high efficiency by RBMSCs. The fraction of RBMSCs that internalized the nanoparticles 

reached 50.3% after 12 hrs and a maximum of 95.7% after 7 d of culturing (Table 1). Then, at day 14 a 

decrease of the internalization is detected which may be related to the fact that RBMSCs reach 

confluence around day 7. Moreover, the RBMSCs were stained with propidium iodide to quantify the 

fraction of live cells.

From Table 1, it is concluded that the fraction of live cells cultured in the presence of FITC-labeled 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles did not significantly differ from that of the control. This result 

also demonstrates the biocompatible nature of the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles.

nanoparticles by the fraction of live RBMSCs, after the period of 12 hrs until 14 d. The percentage of live 

cells (stained with propidium iodide, PI method) was obtained from the analysis of a total number of 

10,000 cells per sample. 

 

 

 

 

Fluorescence microscopy of RBMSCs cultured in the presence of FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles corroborated the above-mentioned results of internalization studies carried out 

using a cell line, i.e. confirmed that the nanoparticles were internalized and widely distributed in the 

cytoplasm of RBMSCs (Figure 7). RBMSCs continued to internalize the nanoparticles (higher 

fluorescent signals) when cultured for longer periods of time. Additionally, RBMSCs were also stained 

with Texas-red phalloidin for observation of the cell cytoskeletons. This makes it possible to assess 

whether the presence of the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles affects the 

cytoskeleton. It is known that cell mutations involve rearrangements and morphological modifications 

[41]. From careful examinations it was concluded that no morphological changes could be detected 

compared to the control (data not shown). Interestingly, it appears that the FITC-labeled 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles are confined inside vesicular bodies resembling endosomes. 

This observation would support the idea that their transport may occur through an endocytotic 

transcellular pathway. As was also observed for SaOS-2 cells, there is evidence of the presence of 

nanoparticles in the RBMSCs nucleus.

3.4. MECHANISM OF CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES INTERNALIZATION 

In order to gain further insights on the internalization mechanism, complementary experiments were 

carried out. The in vitro experimental design consisted of culturing the RBMSCs in the presence of 

FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM nanoparticles and restrictive endocytotic drugs such as colchicine [5]. It is 

known that colchicine binds tightly to microtubules causing microtubule depolymerisation, and by this 

mechanism affects endocytosis.  

On the other hand, it has been reported [42,43] that the translocation of macromolecules larger than       

10 nm from the cytoplasm to the nucleus is via active transport through the nuclear pore complex 

(NPC), whereas small molecules and proteins smaller than 20-40 kDa cross the 10 nm diameter 

channels of the NPC by passive diffusion. Thus, we also expose the RBMSCs to apyrase, a nuclear 

translocator inhibitor that causes ATP depletion, to study whether this treatment affects translocation of 

the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM nanoparticles from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. 

Figure 8 shows the percentage of RBMSCs-associated fluorescence due to nanoparticle internalization 

after culturing the cells in the presence and/or absence of the restrictive drugs, for periods of 12 hrs,     

24 hrs, 7 d and 14 d. The results show that when culturing the RBMSCs in the presence of colchicine

(green peak), apyrase (dark-blue peak) or exposed to both (red peak), a decrease in nanoparticle 

internalization is always observed. In fact, when colchicine is not present in the culture medium the 

nanoparticle internalization efficiency doubles for the culturing periods comprising the first 24 hrs. 

However, the difference is not so pronounced after 7 and 14 d. Therefore, the present studies support 

the idea that not only nanoparticle internalization is highly dependent on the endocytosis mechanism, 

but also suggest that nanoparticles enter cells by a mechanism that might not be exclusively 

endocytotic. As previously discussed, the size of nanoparticles strongly dictates the mechanism by 

which they are internalized [27,44]. The nanoparticles described herein have sizes ranging from 

approximately 6 to 220 nm, and thus may be internalized by different mechanisms, i.e. cellular uptake of 

particles either by passive transport caused through perturbations of the membrane, endocytosis, and 

phagocytosis [5,27].

On the other hand, FACS analysis showed that apyrase exposure did not affect nanoparticle 

internalization to a great extent after 7 and 14 d. However, after 24 hrs the observed internalization 

values with apyrase exposure (dark-blue peak) are significantly lower when compared to those of 

nanoparticle internalization without apyrase exposure (black peaks).  

RBMSCs exposed to the restrictive drugs were also observed by fluorescence microscopy (Figure 9). 

As shown in Figure 9C, it was observed that the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles 

were internalized and widely distributed in the cytoplasm of RBMSCs, and the cells exhibited a normal 

morphology after 14 d. On the other hand, the depletion of ATP in the cells exposed to apyrase resulted 

in a decrease in nanoparticle internalization, which is more evident under fluorescence microscopy 

observation than by FACS analysis (Figure 9D). A preferential localization around the perinuclear area 

was observed when the cells were treated with apyrase. It should be noted that the cells were not 

exposed to permeabilizing agents to avoid any undesired effects on the integrity of the cell nuclei. This 

result suggests that the presence of apyrase also prevents the nanocarriers from entering the cell 

nuclei, at least to a certain extent, since small molecules cross the 10 nm diameter channels of the NPC 

by passive diffusion. However, further complimentary studies are needed to clearly elucidate the 

possible localization of nanoparticles in the nucleus and whether nuclear import is an energy-dependent 

active process, since no ATP and/or GTP regenerating systems or temperature-dependent assays were 

carried out [42,43]. On the other hand, when colchicine was present in the culture medium a dramatic 

decrease in nanoparticle internalization was observed (Figures 9E-F). In other words, the presence of 

colchicine restricted nanoparticle internalization. Additionally, the exposure of RBMSCs to colchicine 

seems to prevent the formation of vesicular structures, as evidenced by the observation of uniform 

fluorescence of the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles around the perinuclear area. 

This assay further suggests that nanoparticles enter in the cells by a mechanism that is not exclusively 

endocytotic. The colchicine treatment negatively affected cell growth, i.e. only a small number of stained 

nuclei were observed. Cytoskeleton morphology (Figures 9B, E and F) is also altered as evidenced by 

the increase in length of actin filaments when comparing to that of control (Figure 9A). This is not 

surprisingly, since it is well known that colchicine disrupts the cytoskeleton [45]. Tsai et al. [46] reported 

that colchicine at concentrations less than 1 ?M caused disruption of microtubular structures of 

neutrophiles, but had little effect on either F-actin or on cellular mechanical properties. On the other 

hand, higher concentrations of colchicine disrupted microtubular structure, but also caused increased 

actin polymerization and cell rigidity. Thus, the present data demonstrate that the CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles have great potential for various applications as intracellular nanocarriers since

they show properties useful for launching cell-impermeable drugs/DNA within target cells, for example. 

Moreover, in addition to their applications in intracellular drug delivery systems (DDS), they can also be 

used for live-cell imaging during in vitro culturing. It is further emphasized that the low toxicity of 

CMCht/PAMAM nanoparticles is in contrast to those of most transfection agents and fluorescent labels, 

which exhibit significant cytotoxicity and have a period of use limited to only a few hours [38,47].

3.5. IN VITRO RELEASE OF DEXAMETHASONE FROM THE CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES 

Glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone (Dex) have been shown [48-50] to promote the osteogenic 

differentiation of stem cells. On the other hand glucocorticoids bind to the cytoplasmatic glucocorticoid 

receptor [51,52].  Therefore, Dex is the ideal drug to further investigate the loading and performance of the 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles as an intracellular drug delivery system. Figure 10 depicts the 

Dex release profile from CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles at physiological pH. We have studied 

the effect of serum proteins on the retention of Dex by adding 15% fetal bovine serum, FBS to PBS 

solution.

PBS buffer in the presence (-?-) or absence (-?-) of 15% FBS under agitation at 37°C, 60 rpm and 

determined by high performance liquid chromatography for the period of 1 h until 7 d. The results are 

expressed as an average ± standard deviation, n=6. 

A initial burst release of Dex is observed and the concentration reaches a maximum of 4 µg.mL-1 in 

PBS with 15% FBS, after 24 hrs. The release kinetics of Dex followed a steady release after the initial 

burst, which lasted for 7d. This data shows that Dex is released as free drug. The release of Dex from 

nanoparticles seems to be very slow for about 6 days after the initial release period, in the presence of 



CHAPTER VI. Surface engineered carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles for intracellular targeting 

 

 
 
- 250 - 
 
 

serum proteins. By comparing the release rate of Dex in absence of serum proteins, it can be seen that 

Dex is released more slowly, after the initial burst period and a higher amount of Dex is still being 

released at this second stage. This data shows that the presence of serum proteins increases the initial 

amount of Dex released from the nanoparticles. This data is in agreement with previous study [53], and 

may be related to nanoparticles degradation by serum proteins. Despite, further degradation studies 

need to be carried out to elucidate this issue. The time scale for the Dex release from the nanoparticles 

is of the same order of their internalization by cells. This could provide an indication of retention of 

dexamethasone within nanoparticles in culture media and its release rate after has been internalized by 

cells, in vitro.  This and other issues such as what will be the Dex release profile inside the endosomes 

(pH 5) and in vivo situation remains to be examined in future studies. 

3.6. IN VITRO OSTEOGENIC DIFFERENTIATION OF RBMSCS EXPOSED TO THE CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER 

NANOPARTICLES 

Osteodifferentiation study is an interesting in vitro model to validate the incorporation and release of 

dexamethasone from the nanocarriers, since osteogenic differentiation varies with the dose and 

duration of exposure to the glucocorticoids [48]. On the other hand, in vitro osteogenic differentiation of 

stem cells mimics many characteristics of the normal osteogenesis occurring in vivo. Under appropriate 

culture conditions stem cells are induced to express osteogenic markers such as bone-specific alkaline 

phosphatase (ALP), osteopontin and osteocalcin [49,54]. The deposition of an extracellular matrix namely 

type I collagen may occur, and as a consequence mineralization can be observed [50,55,56]. Calcium 

presence is a late marker of osteoblast differentiation. In this work, the mineralization was qualitatively 

investigated using the Alizarin red staining (Figure 11). These results have shown that RBMSCs 

cultures exposed to Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles showed high mineralization, 

as seen by the calcium staining (Figures 11C-D). The extent of calcium deposition in cultures exposed 

to Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles at a final concentration of 0.01 mg.mL-1 was of 

same magnitude as in cultures treated with of standard culture media with Dex (osteogenic media), 

while RBMSCs cultured in the presence of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles showed no 

mineralized nodules (Figure 11B). This is an important data since it shows that incorporation 

dexamethasone and nanoparticles concentration influence the intensity and extent of mineralization. 

Moreover, it can be seen an overall increase of calcium deposition in cultures exposed to Dex as 

compared to those lacking the glucocorticoid (Figures 11A, B and F). The in vitro release studies 

showed that Dex concentration reaches a maximum of 4 µg.mL-1 in PBS with 15% FBS, after 24 hrs. 



CHAPTER VI. Surface engineered carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles for intracellular targeting 

 
 

- 251 - 
 
 

Therefore, in a culture media with 0.01 mg.mL-1 of Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles, the concentration of Dex is expected to be in the magnitude of 40 ng.mL-1 (10 nM). 

Therefore, the Dex released from CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles resembles to that from 

osteogenic media. These range of concentrations of Dex has been shown to be effective for the 

osteogenic differentiation of MSCs [48,57].

It is known that ALP, a cell surface glycoprotein is an early marker of osteogenic differentiation [54,58]. To 

confirm the osteogenic differentiation of RBMSCs exposed to Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles, we carried out an ALP staining (Figure 12). As seen in calcium staining, presence of the 

clusters of cuboid-shaped stained with ALP is higher in cultures exposed to Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles (Figures 12C-D). It is possible to observe a strong ALP staining in cultures with 

Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM nanoparticles at a concentration of 0.01 mg.mL-1. These results are further

RBMSCs occurs in the presence of Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles.

Figure 13 shows the quantitative analysis of ALP activity, both normalized for DNA content (left) and

nanoparticles, and ?-glycerophosphate presented similar ALP activity. It can be seen that ALP activity is 

increased in cultures with Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. No statistical 

differences were observed for cultures grown in the presence osteogenic medium and standard culture 

media with different concentrations of Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. As 

expected we observed the up-regulation of ALP in the RBMSCs exposed to Dex. Dex consistently 

increased ALP activity, but it should be noted that Dex does not globally stimulates all genes considered

The late osteogenic marker and bone-specific osteocalcin was also measured by performing an 

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA (Figure 14). It is possible to observe that osteocalcin 

deposition occur in cultures exposed to the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. 

In addition, higher osteocalcin content in cultures treated with osteogenic media can be seen. Despite, 

the magnitude of osteocalcin deposition do not present significant differences when comparing to that of 

cultures with 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. These observations 

can be explained by the fact that differentiation proceed to mineralization and the responsiveness of 

osteocalcin synthesis to long-term exposure to Dex, as this late marker appears to reach a maximum 

just before or during mineralized tissue formation [59]. Therefore, the present biochemical findings 

demonstrate that RBMSCs differentiate into osteoblasts and organize into a mineralized matrix when 

culturing in the presence of Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles.

While it is yet to be determined the intracellular Dex release profile, the in vitro release and 

differentiation studies have proved particularly useful to demonstrate that dexamethasone was 

incorporated into the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and it was released at a concentration 

that caused no negative effects on the RBMSCs osteogenic differentiation.

4. CONCLUSIONS 

The results in this paper demonstrated that the combination of synthetic and natural-based polymers 

enable to prepare CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles of suitable diameters to cover a wide range 

of intracellular delivery applications. In vitro tests showed that the 

carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles do not exert any significant cytotoxic 

effect over both L929 fibroblast and RBMSCs for concentrations below 1 mg.mL-1. Furthermore, the 

successful internalization of the nanoparticles by two different types of cells, i.e. cell lines and primary 

cultures, was also demonstrated. The biochemical data presented herein also proved that the 

dexamethasone-loaded carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles induced the

osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow stem cells, in vitro. Therefore, the novel 

carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles may be used as targeted-drug 

delivery carriers covering a wide range of applications involving the efficient intracellular delivery of 

biological agents to modulate the behaviour of cells. These might include the use of differentiation 

factors to act from the inside the cell or genetic material. The incorporation of fluorescent labels for live-

cell imaging and monitoring of the final intracellular fate of such structures is also possible.

Abstract 

Central nervous system associated disorders are the leading cause of disability worldwide. In recent 

years targeted drug delivery nanoparticle based systems for intracellular application have been put 

forward has a possible therapeutic route to follow. In this sense the objective of the present report was 

to characterize and evaluate the possible applicability of the recently developed 

carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) (CMCht/PAMAM) dendrimer nanoparticles for central nervous 

system (CNS) regenerative medicine. Atomic force and transmission electron microscopy observations 

have revealed that the nanoparticles possessed a nanosphere-like shape, with a mean size ranging 

from 22.0 to 30.7 nm. Moreover it was also possible to confirm by UV-Vis spectrophotometry that these 

nanoparticles could be bound to the fluorescent-probe fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) for tracing 

purposes. Experiments with post-natal hippocampal neurons and cortical glial cells revealed that both 

cell populations were able to internalize the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles with 

high efficiency. The internalization rates changed according to the cell populations, reaching a peak 

after 48 hours of incubation. Overall astrocytes and microglial cells disclosed higher internalization rates 

(around 100% of the total cell sub-population) followed by neurons and oligodendrocytes (up to 80-90% 

of the observed cells). Further experiments for periods up to 7 days revealed that the periodical addition 

of FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles was needed to maintain the levels of 

internalization. This fact was attributed to the proliferation of neuroprogenitors, astrocytes and 

oligodendrocytes in hippocampal neurons and cortical glial cells cultures, respectively. Finally, it was 

also observed that cell viability and proliferation were not significantly affected by the presence of the 

above referred nanoparticles. Further studies will be focused on loading relevant drugs for future CNS 

applications.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Central nervous system associated disorders are a leading cause of disability worldwide. Although in 

recent years several new drugs have been put forward to tackle problems such as Parkinson’s and 

Alzheimer’s Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, and Spinal Cord Injury, one still faces the low efficacy that the 

latter are delivered into the brain. The greatest treatment obstacle is not the drug potency itself, but 

rather the physical barriers, such as the blood brain barrier (BBB), that render the typical circulatory 

routes of delivery ineffective [1-3].  In fact the same mechanisms that protect the brain from foreign 

substances, also restrict the entry of many potentially therapeutic agents [1-4], such as larger molecular 

weight molecules, like peptides, proteins and oligonucleotides [1,3]. Therefore there is an urgent need for 

the development of new routes that can efficiently overcome this problem. 

One of such routes could be trough the use of nanomedicine based approaches, namely those dealing 

with the development of targeted drug delivery nanoparticle-based systems. The latter do not only 

possess the advantage of their size, but simultaneously could be surface engineered in order to present 

the adequate properties (e.g. surface chemistry) that would allow them to cross the BBB [1,4]. In general 

terms, drugs could be dissolved, entrapped, encapsulated or attached to a nanoparticle matrix, serving 

in this sense as a “Trojan horse” for a variety of chemical and biological entities [5-7]. Moreover as they 

are normally able to be internalized by CNS derived cells, they could be quite useful in the modulation of 

the activity of neuronal/glial cells intracellular receptors.   

Baring this in mind several nanoparticle based systems have been developed throughout the years. For 

instance, different authors have shown that poly(butyl)cyanoacrylate based nanoparticles could be used 

as efficient dug delivery agents within the brain [8-11]. Other studies [12-15] have also revealed that 

liposomes, which commonly disclosed a non-toxic and biodegradable behaviour, could be quite effective 

for the transport of drugs into the brain. Still within this topic, dendrimers have also been put forward as 

yet another route for the above referred applications [16-19]. Dendrimers are synthetic highly branched, 

spherical, monodisperse macromolecules of nanometer dimension [16]. They are easily internalized by 

cells, property that might be of use if the goal is to deal with, for instance, intracellular receptors of CNS 

derived cells. Their multiple surface functional groups can be easily modified to potentially attack a large 

number of ligands for a selected targeted drug delivery application, while its inner hydrophobic core is 

amenable for drug entrapment [16,20,21]. However, the non-covalent encapsulation of drugs into 

dendrimers presents a general drawback as it is difficult to control the release of the molecules from the 

dendrimer core [21]. Furthermore, in order to increase the rate of drug incorporation, it is common to use

higher generation of dendrimers (G7) with amine capping-groups which has been shown to cause 

haemolysis and changes in red cell morphology, leading to a general overall cytotoxic behaviour [22].  

In order to obviate these problems Oliveira et al. [23] have recently proposed a new strategy consisting 

on poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer core with grafted carboxymethylchitosan (CMCht) chains. By 

doing so, this novel class of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles could display a higher loading 

capacity due to peripheral congestion, which can improve container properties, and also can allow the 

bulk incorporation of bioactive molecules of higher molecular weights and of different chemistry. 

Simultaneously they could maintain the high internalization efficiency with improved biological 

properties, when compared to conventional dendrimers [23].  

Following on this initial report the objectives of the present work consists in determining the possible 

application of these systems for CNS related applications by studying their role on the viability and 

proliferation of hippocampal neurons and cortical glial cells, as well as to investigate the internalization 

rate of the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles by the latter. Results revealed that CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles were not deleterious to both hippocampal neurons and cortical glial cells and 

did not impaired cell proliferation in these two systems. Furthermore it was also possible to observe that 

neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglial cells were able to internalize the CMCht/PAMAM 

nanoparticles at different rates. The latter varied along the different cell populations, but overall started 

after 1 hour of incubation reaching a peak, that ranged between 80-100%, after 48 hours of exposure. 

Moreover it was also observed, namely for oligodendrocytes and neurons, that the periodical addition of 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles was needed to maintain the internalization rate for periods of 

up to 7 days in culture.  

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  

2.1. CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES SYNTHESIS 

The synthesis of the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles was carried out as described elsewhere 

[23]. Succinctly, CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were prepared using a step-by-step method: (i) 

increasing the generation of the PAMAM-carboxylic terminated dendrimer, PAMAM-CT (G 1.5), (ii) 

obtaining a PAMAM-methyl ester terminated dendrimer, (iii) reaction of PAMAM with 

carboxymethylchitosan possessing a degree of deacetylation of 80% and degree of substitution of 47%. 

Then, the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were precipitated after addition of an appropriate 

volume of a saturated sodium carbonate, Na2CO3 (Aldrich, Germany) solution and acetone (Pronalab,

Portugal), under vigorous agitation. Precipitates were collected by filtration, dispersed in ultra-pure water 

for extensive dialysis and freeze-dried (Telstar-Cryodos -80, Spain) at -80ºC. In order to trade down the 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles within the intracellular compartment the latter were labeled 

with fluorescein isothiocyanate, FITC (Sigma, Germany).  For this purpose conjugates of FITC-labeled 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were prepared by covalently bonding the amine group of 

carboxymethylchitosan and the isothyocianate group of FITC (thiourea bond). The labeling efficiency 

was investigated by UV-Vis spectrophotometry (NanoDropTM ND-1000; NanoDrop Technologies, USA) 

by reading the absorvance at 280 nm and 495 nm, and the determination of FITC:CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles molar ratio calculated using a standard curve. 

2.2. CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES PHYSICAL CHARACTERIZATION 

The morphology of the nanoparticles was investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The 

freeze-dried CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were dispersed in ultrapure water to obtain a 

solution with final concentration of 1 mg.mL-1, and then 20 ?L was placed over a 9.9 mm mica disc 

(Agar Scientific, England) and blown dried with nitrogen gas for subsequent characterization. The 

samples were analyzed using the Tapping Mode™ with a MultiMode AFM connected to a NanoScope III 

controller, both from Veeco, USA, with non-contact silicon nanoprobes (ca 300 kHz) from Nanosensors, 

Switzerland. All images were plane-fitted using the third degree-flatten procedure included in the 

NanoScope software version 4.43r8. The morphometric analysis was performed using the same 

software. Complementarily, the morphology of the particles was also analysed under a transmission 

electron microscope, TEM (Philips CM-12, FEI Company, The Netherlands, equipped with a MEGA 

VIEW-II DOCU camera and Image Software Analyzer SIS NT DOCU).  

2.3. CELL CULTURE 

2.3.1. Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons 

Hippocampal neuron cultures were prepared from P4 Wistar rats [24]. Upon dissection, hippocampus 

tissue samples were submitted to trypsin based enzymatic digestion (0.05% Trypsin – Gibco; 3 mg.mL-1 

BSA – Sigma; 0.0025% DNase – Sigma, in EBSS - Gibco) for 10 minutes, followed by mechanical 

dissociation and centrifugation. Isolated cells were then plated on poly-D-lysine coated coverslips at a 

density of 4 x 104 cells.cm-2. Cultures were maintained (37°C, 5% CO2/95% air, 90% relative humidity) 

in Neurobasal A medium/B27 supplemented with 1 mM Glutamax I, 10 ng.mL-1 basic fibroblast growth

factor (b-FGF) and 0.1 mg.mL-1 kanamycin (all from Gibco, USA) for 7 days. From day seven onwards 

two sets of experiments were performed: 1) In order to determine the internalization time of FITC-

labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles by hippocampal neurons, cultures were incubated with 

200 ?g.mL-1 nanoparticles for periods of 1, 2, 6, 12, 15, 18, 24 and 48 hours; 2) To understand whether 

the  maintenance of the CMCht/PAMAM concentration in the culture medium was essential to maintain 

the levels of internalization, cultures were incubated for periods up to 7 days in which CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles were added to the culture medium every 48 hours in one group, while in the 

other nanoparticles were only added on the first day of the experiment.  

2.3.2. Primary cultures of cortical glial cells  

Cortical glial cells were isolated from P4 newborns (Wistar Rats) as previously described [25]. Upon 

dissection, cortices were submitted to an enzymatic cocktail (30 mg.mL-1 DNase, 0.25% Trypsin, both 

from Sigma) in Ca2+/Mg2+ free HBSS (Gibco)  followed by mechanical dissociation. Glial cells were then 

obtained by centrifuging the cells suspension at 800 rpm for 2 minutes, and plated out on coverslips 

previously coated with Poly-D-Lysine at a density of 4 x 104 cells.cm-2. Glial cells were then maintained 

for one week in DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 1% antibiotics/antimycotics solution and 10% FBS. 

At this time point similar experiments to those performed with hippocampal cultures were carried out. In 

order to determine if astrocytes and oligodendrocyte cells proliferation was affecting internalization rate 

after 7 days of incubation with or without renovation, cultures were treated at day 7 with ‘5-fluoro-2’-

deoxiuridina (FDU, Sigma), a known inhibitor of glial cell proliferation. 

2.3.3. Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons 

Cortical glial cells were isolated from P4 newborns (Wistar Rats) as previously described [25]. Upon 

dissection, cortices were submitted to an enzymatic cocktail (30 mg.mL-1 DNase, 0.25% Trypsin, both 

from Sigma) in Ca2+/Mg2+ free HBSS (Gibco)  followed by mechanical dissociation. Glial cells were then 

obtained by centrifuging the cells suspension at 800 rpm for 2 minutes, and plated out on coverslips 

previously coated with Poly-D-Lysine at a density of 4 x 104 cells.cm-2. Glial cells were then maintained 

for one week in DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 1% antibiotics/antimycotics solution and 10% FBS. 

At this time point similar experiments to those performed with hippocampal cultures were carried out. In 

order to determine if astrocytes and oligodendrocyte cells proliferation was affecting internalization rate 

after 7 days of incubation with or without renovation, cultures were treated at day 7 with ‘5-fluoro-2’-

deoxiuridina (FDU, Sigma), a known inhibitor of glial cell proliferation.

2.4. MTS ASSAY 

For both neurons and glial cells, cell viability was assessed by the MTS test, after 7 days of incubation 

(with or without renovation) with FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. The MTS  (3-

(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2(4-sulfophenyl)-2H tetrazolium) (Promega, 

USA) test is an assay in which the substrate – MTS – is bioreduced into a brown formazan product by 

NADPH or NADP produced by mitochondrial enzymes, which are active in living cells [26,27]. This assay, 

or others similar to it (MTT, WST-1), have been widely used to measure cellular viability and 

proliferation. Hippocampal neurons and glial cells cultures (n=3) were placed in culture medium 

containing MTS in a 5:1 ratio and incubated in a humidified atmosphere at 37ºC and 5% CO2. After 

three hours of incubation 100 ?L of solution from each well were transferred to 96-well plates and the 

optical density was determined at 490 nm.  

2.5. TOTAL PROTEIN QUANTIFICATION 

In order to complement the data obtained with the MTS test, total protein was quantified by using the 

BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce Chemical, USA). This system uses bicinchoninic acid (BCA) as the 

detection reagent for Cu+1, which is formed when Cu+2 is reduced by protein in an alkaline environment. 

The purple coloured reaction product is formed by the chelation of two molecules of BCA with one 

cuprous ion (Cu+1). Cells were lysed in ultra-pure H2O after which the total protein was quantified 

according to the manufacturer’s protocol. At the end of the assay, 100 ?L of each sample were 

transferred to 96-well plates where a standard curve was prepared and the absorbance read at 562 nm 

in a multi-well plate reader (Tecan, USA). 

2.6. IMMUNOCYTOCHEMISTRY 

Following each culture period, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes, 

permeabilized by incubation with 100% methanol for 2 minutes at room temperature, and washed three 

times in PBS. Cells were then blocked with 10% FBS/PBS (60 minutes) and followed by a 60 minutes 

incubation with the following primary antibodies: mouse anti-rat microtubule associated protein-2    

(MAP-2) (Sigma, USA, 1:500) to detect mature hippocampal neurons, rabbit anti-rat glial fibrillary acid 

protein (GFAP) (Dako, Denmark, 1:500) for astrocytes, mouse anti-CD11b (BD Biosciences Pharmigen, 

USA, 1:100) for microglial cells and mouse anti-O4 (R&amp;amp;D systems, USA, 1:50) for oligodendrocytes. 

Cells were then washed in PBS and incubated with the secondary antibody: Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-

mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Alexa Fluor goat anti-rabbit 488 (Molecular Probes, USA) for 60 

minutes. The primary antibody was omitted to produce negative controls. Samples were further 

observed under an Olympus BX-61 Fluorescence Microscope (Olympus, Germany). Levels of        

FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles internalization by the different cell population 

was achieved by the following (n=3, 5 random fields/coverslip): 

% of positive cells for internalization= number of cells positive for FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles internalization/total number of cells 

2.7. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 

Statistical evaluation was performed using one way ANOVA (internalization times experiments) and two-

tailed paired t-student tests (MTS, total protein, comparison between renovation and no-renovation of 

FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles in the culture medium), to assess the statistical 

differences between different groups. Statistical significance was defined as p&lt;0.05 for a 95% 

confidence interval.  

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

In the present study we aimed at determining the interactions between a new class of nanoparticle 

based systems, known as CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles, with hippocampal neurons and 

cortical glial cells in order to develop future strategies for CNS regenerative medicine. For this purpose 

the CMCht/PAMAM nanoparticles were firstly characterized under AFM and TEM after which 

hippocampal neurons and cortical glial cells were exposed to the latter for different culture periods.  

Initially and in order to further characterize the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles an AFM study 

was performed to both evaluate their size and morphology (Figure 1). From Figure 1A it is possible to 

observe the 3-D AFM image of the PAMAM-carboxylic terminated (G1.5) dendrimers. This data reveals 

the monodispersive character of these macromolecules. On the other hand, Figure 1B shows the 3-D 

image of the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles, which clearly shows the consistency of these 

molecules, i.e. nanosphere-like shape. By performing a threshold technique it became possible to 

perform the morphometric analysis of the latter. This study revealed that the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles have a mean size ranging from 22.0 to 30.7 nm for a confidence level of 95%, and a 

confidence level of ± 4.4 (Figure 1D). This data was further confirmed by TEM analysis (Figure 1E) that 

revealed the nanosphere-like morphology of the nanoparticles.

Regarding the biological assays, the effects of the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles on neurons 

and glial cells viability and proliferation, were the first parameters to be assessed. For this purpose both 

cell cultures systems were incubated for one week with the nanoparticles under study. In one of the 

groups CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticle concentration was renewed every 48 hours, while in the 

other, nanoparticles were only added to the culture medium at day 0 of the experiment with no further 

additions. Figure 2 shows the results of the MTS and total protein assays. MTS test (Figure 2) was used 

in order to determine the cell viability/metabolic activity of hippocampal neurons and cortical glial cells.

cells after incubation for 7 days with the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles         

(200 ?g.mL-1) with or without periodical renovations every 48 hours. MTS results showed that the 

metabolic activity/cell viability of both cell populations was not dramatically altered between the two 

tested groups. Similar results were also obtained for the total protein quantification (n=3, mean + SD, 

p&gt;0.05). 

Results revealed that both cell populations were producing large amounts of a brown formazan product 

which is an indication of normal cell viability and metabolism, as cells were able to incorporate and

metabolize MTS. However it should be referred that for the hippocampal neurons there was a slight 

difference, non significant (p&gt;0.05), between the two groups. This effect could be attributed to the 

periodical renovation of the CMCht/PAMAM nanoparticles concentration, as the latter lead to a small 

acidification of the culture medium  

The data obtained with the MTS test was subsequently confirmed by a total protein quantification assay 

(Figure 2), which can be considered as an indication of cell proliferation. Similar to the results achieved 

by the MTS test, some slight or no differences were found between the tested and control samples 

(p&gt;0.05), and therefore it was demonstrated that cell proliferation of both cell populations in the two 

tested conditions was not affected by the presence the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. 

After testing if the CMCht/PAMAM nanoparticles had any deleterious effect on cell viability and 

proliferation of both neuronal and glial cell populations, the objectives of the present report were focused 

on the determination of the internalization time and rate in two different sets of experiments. Figure 3 

shows the results obtained in primary cultures of post-natal hippocampal neurons. As it can be observed 

hippocampal neurons were able to internalize the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendronized 

nanoparticles (Figure 3A, after 24 hours of exposure to a concentration of 200 ?g.mL-1). Furthermore 

the same experiments also revealed that the internalization rate tended to increase with time, presenting 

three different plateaus: 1) between 1-3 hours the rates are around 5-10%; 2) between 6-18 hours 

around 40-50% and 3) after 18 hours the values were above 50%. Groups 1-3 hours presented 

statistically significant difference (p&lt;0.05) when compared to groups 15 to 48 hours.  Another feature 

noticed with these experiments was the high variability (high standard deviations) obtained among the 

different incubation time. This fact indicates that not all hippocampal neurons disclosed the same 

internalization response at earlier incubation time points. However, and as can be observed in         

Figure 3B, this tendency tended to fade way with time as after 24 and 48 hours the obtained results 

were much more homogenous, as it can be seen by the indicative values of the error bars.  Although it 

was not an objective of the present study to understand the mechanisms by which CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles are internalized by hippocampal neurons, similar experiments performed with 

other cell populations [23] indicate that this phenomena is mediated by endocytosis followed by 

endosomal transport within the intracellular compartment. Finally, it was also observed that the 

periodical renovation of the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles in the culture 

medium is essential for the maintenance of the internalization rates by hippocampal neuron populations 

(Figures 3C-D, p&lt;0.05). It is believed that this fact is related with the proliferation of other cell 

populations present in this culture system, namely neuroprogenitor cells.

Figure 3. Post-natal hippocampal neurons were able to internalize the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles (A). Initially neuronal cells disclosed a high variability on the capacity of 

internalizing the nanoparticles. However results tended to be more homogeneous after 24 hours of 

incubations, reaching a maximum of internalization (around 80-90%) after 48 hours of incubation (B). 

Further experiments (C-E) also showed that the maintenance of the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticle concentration in the culture medium was essential to maintain the levels of 

internalization. The differences observed in C-E were attributed to the proliferation of other cell 

populations within the hippocampal neuron cultures, namely neuroprogenitor cells (n=3;                          

5 fields/coverslip; mean + SD; p&lt;0.05).

Similar to what had been observed for hippocampal neurons, all three glial cell types were able to 

internalize the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles (Figures 4-6).  

 

Figure 4. Internalization experiments within cortical glial cell cultures showed that astrocytes were also 

able to internalize the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles (A- after 48 hours of 

incubation). As it can be observed in (B) the internalization occurred in a gradual manner reaching a 

peak (around 100% of internalization) after 48 hours of incubation). When exposed for longer periods of 

time it was observed that the periodical addition of nanoparticles to the culture medium was needed to 

stabilize the levels of internalization (C-E); (n=3; 5 fields/coverslip; mean + SD; p&lt;0.05).

This fact is noteworthy to mention, as in the culture system used in the present work all glial cell types 

were present, and therefore is an indicative that the nanoparticles under study are not preferentially up 

taken and consequently phagocytised by microglial cells. Nevertheless, all glial cell populations 

disclosed different internalization patterns. For instance, astrocytes (Figure 4) revealed a steady 

constant increase on the number of positive cells for FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles internalization reaching the highest value after 48 hours of incubation (around 100%). On 

the other hand oligodendrocytes (Figure 5) disclosed a similar pattern to what had been observed with 

hippocampal cultures, disclosing three different levels of internalization, with the highest value around 

80-90%. Finally, and as expected due to its phagocytotic nature, microglia (Figure 6) had the fastest and 

highest rates of internalization, showing levels of around 100% after 12 hours of incubation. The 

differences obtained between astrocytes and oligodendrocytes to the same concentration of FITC-

labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles are probably related with their different endocytotic 

capabilities. Moreover it was also seen that the size of the nanoparticles that could be found within the 

intracellular compartment varied according to the cell type observed. For instance, microglial cells 

(Figure 6A) tended to internalize particles with an increased size when compared to neurons (Figure 3A) 

and oligodendrocytes (Figure 5A). This fact is mainly related with phagocytotic activity of microglial cells, 

that commonly phagocytise particles above 100 nm [1]. Moreover this data also indicate that neurons 

and oligodendrocytes preferentially internalize particles bellow this size. 

As for the hippocampal neurons, all glia cell types, namely oligodendrocytes, had reduced 

internalization rates (p&lt;0.05) whenever FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles 

concentration was not renewed in the culture medium. For microglial cels this fact was attributed to the 

macrophage behaviour of the latter, which lead to the degradation of the particles within the intracellular 

compartment. However for astrocytes and oligodendrocytes the observed phenomena was attributed to 

cell proliferation, as these cells tend to possess higher proliferation rates when compared to microglial 

cells. This hypothesis was further assessed by stopping cell proliferation within the cortical glial cell 

primary cultures (Figure 7). In these conditions, and as it can be observed in Figure 7, no differences 

were found between the two tested groups (p&gt;0.05).

Figure 5. Oligodendrocytes also reveal to be capable of internalizing the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles. (A) representative image of the nanoparticles distributed along the intracellular 

compartment. As it can be observed they were scattered around the nucleus, as well as distributed 

along the cytoplasmatic processes of the cells. Within the oligodendrocyte population it was possible to 

observe three plateau of internalization, being the highest obtained after 48 hours of incubation (B- 

around 80-90%).  Similarly to what happened with neurons and astrocytes, the maintenance of the 

internalization levels within the oligodendrocyte cell population was dependent on the maintenance of 

the concentration of the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles in the culture medium 

(C-E); (n=3; 5 fields/coverslip; mean + SD; p&lt;0.05).

Figure 6. Microglial cells were able to internalize FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles 

at a faster rate (A,B) when compared to other neuronal and glial cell populations. This fact cannot be 

dissociated from the phagocytotic capability of these cells. Furthermore, figure A also allowed observe 

that the size of the particles internalized by microglial cells was higher when compared to the one 

disclosed by other cell populations. Similar effects to those previously observed with other cell 

populations regarding the influence of the periodical addition of nanoparticles on the levels of 

internalization were also observed (C-E). This result is probably related with the macrophage-like 

behaviour of these cells.

Figure 7. Cortical glial cells cultures were treated with FDU in order to determine if the decrease on the 

rates of FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles internalization by astrocytes (A-C) and 

oligodendrocytes (D-F) was related to their cell proliferation. As it can be observed, whenever astrocyte 

and oligodendrocyte cells proliferation is impaired, the levels of internalization are not dependent on the 

periodical additions of FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles to the culture medium. 

This fact is an indication that the results observed in Figures 4 and 5 are related with the cell 

proliferation of the above referred cell populations.

4. CONCLUSIONS 

With the present work it was possible to demonstrate that carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) 

dendrimer nanoparticles disclosed a nanosphere-like shape. Furthermore it was also revealed that the 

binding of these nanoparticles to fluorescent probes (e.g. FITC) for tracing purposes was also possible. 

At the biological level it was possible to determine that the cell viability and proliferation of post-natal 

neurons and glial cells was not affected upon exposure to the above referred nanoparticles. Moreover, it 

was possible to observe that neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglial cells were able to 

internalize, at different rate, the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles, probably 

through endocytotic processes. Finally, it was also observed that cell proliferation of astrocytes and 

oligodendrocytes lead to a decrease on the internalization rate within their total cell populations. Further 

studies will be focused on the loading of relevant drugs for CNS related applications into the 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles.

CHAPTER VIII.  

The osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells cultured with dexamethasone-

loaded carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles  

Abstract 

There is an increasing interest in developing novel macromolecular vehicles for the intracellular and 

controlled delivery of bioactive molecules, since they can allow modulation of the cellular functions in a 

more effective manner ex vivo, and maintain the cellular phenotype in vivo upon re-implantation. The 

present study was designed to investigate the effect of combining novel dexamethasone-loaded 

carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer (Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM) nanoparticles and, 

both HAp and SPCL scaffolds (3-D system) on the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of rat 

bone marrow stromal cells (RBMSCs) in vitro. A luminescent cell viability assay using RBMSCs was 

performed for screening cytotoxicity of the developed HAp and SPCL scaffolds. Results corroborated 

previous ones which have demonstrated in vitro, the superior performance of the HAp and SPCL 

scaffolds on supporting cells adhesion and proliferation. Furthermore, this work showed that RBMSCs 

seeded onto the surface of both HAp and SPCL scaffolds differentiate into osteoblasts when cultured in 

the presence of 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. In addition, results 

demonstrated that Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles combined with the HAp 

enhance osteogenesis by increasing ALP activity and mineralization of the extracellular matrix. The pre-

incubation of stem cells with these kinds of nanoparticles allows the delivery of Dex inside the cells and 

directly influences their cellular fate, being a promising new tool to be used in cells and tissue 

engineering strategies.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a valuable therapeutic tool in tissue engineering (TE) [1], since they 

can proliferate and differentiate either in vitro or in vivo into a multitude of distinct cellular        

phenotypes [2-4]. It is well known that the process of stem cell maintenance and differentiation occurs in 

vitro, under optimal culture conditions [5,6]. For example, it has been shown that dexamethasone (Dex) 

delivered as a medium supplement promotes the osteogenic differentiation of marrow stromal cells [4,7]. 

Despite its use in clinical practice [8], Dex and other glucocorticoids have been restricted to few 

applications mainly due to adverse side-effects [9,10]. Therefore, the development of novel strategies that 

can stimulate stem cells to become osteoblasts in vitro and in vivo, and that provide a more effective 

treatment route with diminished complications is still regarded as a hot issue [11] that needs to be 

exploited further. In this context, the use of nanocarriers that possess high cellular uptake efficiency to 

deliver and target drugs can be seen as a possible and reliable solution [12]. Ultimately, these vehicles 

are expected to increase the solubility of drugs [13] and their bioavailability [14], and their delivery to the 

targets where they are required [15,16], thus suppressing harmful secondary effects on the patients during 

drug/cell based treatments.  

A huge portfolio of controlled-release vehicles are being investigated for their ability to process into 

nanocarriers [17,18], while several new emerging nanomaterials are being studied for their 

biodegradability [19,20] and for their controlled-release and stimuli-responsive properties [21,22]. In this 

context, we focus our present work on the surface engineering of poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) 

dendrimers with natural-based and biodegradable polymers such as the water-soluble 

carboxymethylchitosan (CMCht) [23]. Previously [24], we have clearly demonstrated that the 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles are efficiently internalized by different cell types. Since 

glucocorticoids bind to and activate a cytoplasmatic glucocorticoid receptor [25,26], our particular interest 

is in the loading of these novel macromolecular architectures with Dex in order to study their 

internalization and effects on the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of stem cells, in vitro and in 

vivo. 

In this work, we applied a TE strategy consisting of the combination of stem cells and either ceramic or 

polymeric scaffolds as a way to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate their performance in supporting 

the osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells (RBMSCs) exposed to the intracellular 

Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanocarrier. The herein chosen scaffolds were the macroporous 

hydroxylapatite (HAp) [27] and starch-polycaprolactone (SPCL) [28,29] scaffolds which have been found to 

exhibit a unique architecture and adequate physicochemical and biological properties to be used in

bone related applications. However, the novelty of the present paper lies in deeper in vitro studies that 

illustrated the potential applications of combining nanoparticles and scaffolds for cells and tissue 

engineering. Therefore, we went a step further and reported on the osteogenic efficacy of this system, 

and how to make use of this potential in bone TE and regenerative medicine. In vitro studies were 

carried out in order to evaluate the viability of RBMSCs seeded onto the surface of the HAp and SPCL 

scaffolds. In addition, RBMSCs-scaffold constructs specimens were also examined using microscopic 

analyses to assess the cell adhesion and proliferation. Complementarily, scanning electron microscopy, 

LIVE/DEAD viability assay and DNA quantification were carried out after 14 d of culturing. Alizarin red 

and ALP stainings were also performed to qualitatively assess calcium deposition and ALP activity, 

which are parameters denoting osteogenic differentiation. Quantification of the alkaline phosphatase 

activity and osteocalcin content were carried out in order to evaluate the osteoblastic phenotype 

expression levels.  

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  

2.1. PREPARATION OF THE HYDROXYLAPATITE (HAP) AND STARCH-POLYCAPROLACTONE (SPCL) SCAFFOLDS 

Hydroxylapatite (HAp) scaffolds were prepared by impregnating a polyurethane sacrifice sponge (PU,    

5 mm diameter and 4 mm height, Eurospuma S.A., Portugal) with HAp powders obtained as previously 

reported [27]. The elimination of the organic matrix consisted of burning the impregnated sponges in a 

furnace (Fornocerâmica-ATR 901, Portugal) at 900ºC for 24 hrs, then sintering at 1300ºC for 3 hrs.  

Starch-polycaprolactone (SPCL) scaffolds were produced by adopting a two step procedure as 

previously reported elsewhere [28]. The material used was a blend of starch with approximately 70% by 

weight of poly-?-caprolactone, SPCL. Briefly, fibres of SPCL were produced by melt spinning using a 

modular co-rotating twin screw extruder in two consecutive steps to a final draw ratio of approximately 

1:100. Then, melt spun fibres were chopped. Fibre bundles were randomly displaced into the custom-

designed mould cavities and subjected to thermal treatment at 60°C for 30 min before compression and 

fibre bonding. SPCL scaffolds (5 mm diameter and 4 mm height) were obtained through cutting of fibre 

bonded meshes with a circular die. Standardized fabrication conditions enabled the production of 

scaffolds with 67.4 ± 1.3% porosity (as determined by micro-computed tomography). More details on 

SPCL scaffolds can be found elsewhere [30,31]. 

Prior to the cell culture studies HAp and SPCL scaffolds were sterilized in an ethylene oxide gas 

atmosphere.

2.2. SYNTHESIS OF DEXAMETHASONE-LOADED CARBOXYMETHYLCHITOSAN/POLY(AMIDOAMINE) (DEX-LOADED 

CMCHT/PAMAM) DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES 

Carboxymethylchitosan (CMCht) was synthesized by a chemical modification of chitin (Sigma, 

Germany) as described by Chen et al. [32]. Starburst® poly(amidoamine)-carboxylic terminated 

dendrimers, PAMAM-CT (generation 1.5, 20% (w/v) methanolic solution) with an ethylenediamine core 

were purchased from Aldrich. CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were prepared stepwise as 

previously reported [24]. Succinctly, Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were prepared 

by means of mixing CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles in an aqueous solution with a 

dexamethasone (Dex) solution with a final concentration of 5 x 10-4 M, under vigorous agitation. The 

mixture was then added to the precipitation media consisting of a saturated sodium carbonate (Aldrich, 

Germany) and acetone solution. Precipitates were collected and extensive dialysis (cellulose tubing, 

benzoylated for separating compounds with a cut-off of 1,200 from (Sigma, Germany) was carried out 

for 2 d. Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were obtained by freezing the solution at   

-80ºC and freeze-drying (Telstar-Cryodos -80, Spain).  

2.3. CHARACTERIZATION OF THE HAP AND SPCL SCAFFOLDS, AND DEX-LOADED CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER 

NANOPARTICLES 

2.3.1. Surface topography characterization 

The surface morphology and pore size of the HAp scaffolds and SPCL scaffolds were examined under a 

scanning electron microscope, SEM (SM-300, Topcon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Prior to 

microstructure analysis, specimens were sputter coated with platinum using an Ion coater (IB-3, Eiko 

Engineering Ltd., Ibaraki, Japan) with a current set at 6 mA, for a coating time of 2-3 min.  

2.3.2. Micro-computed tomography 

The qualitative and quantitative information about the microstructure of the HAp and SPCL scaffolds 

was obtained by micro-computed tomography, ?-CT 20 equipment (SCANCO Medicals, Switzerland). 

The X-ray scans were acquired in high resolution mode of 11 µm x/y/z [27]. Mimics® (Materialise, 

Belgium) was used as image processing software for CT reconstruction to create and visualize the 3-D 

representations.

2.3.3. Transmission electron microscopy 

The morphology of the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles was investigated by 

transmission electron microscopy, TEM (Philips CM-12, FEI Company, The Netherlands, equipped with 

a MEGA VIEW-II DOCU camera and Image Software Analyzer SIS NT DOCU). The nanoparticles were 

stained with 2% of phosphotungstic acid and placed on copper grids for observation. 

2.4. IN VITRO CELL CULTURE STUDIES 

2.4.1. Isolation and culturing of rat bone marrow stromal cells (RBMSCs)  

Seven-week-old Fischer 344/N male rats were purchased from Japan SLC Inc. (Shizuoka, Japan) and 

sacrificed in accordance with the Ethics Committee at the Tissue Engineering Research Center 

(Amagasaki, Japan). The epiphyseal regions of the femora were removed and marrow plugs in the 

femoral shafts were flushed out using Eagle’s minimum essential medium (MEM, Nacalai Tesque, 

Japan) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, FBS (JRH Biosciences, USA) and 1% antibiotic-

antimycotic (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) solution. The RBMSCs isolation was performed under aseptic 

conditions. RBMSCs were transferred to a T75 cm2 culture flask and expanded in the presence of 

complete MEM medium at 37ºC in a 5% CO2 incubator. Then, the culture medium was changed every 2 

or 3 d. After reaching confluency, the cells (passage 1, P1) were released from substratum with 1 mL of 

0.05% tripsin-0.53 mM EDTA (Invitrogen, USA) and centrifuged at 900 rpm for 5 min. A cell suspension 

was prepared and cell concentration determined using an automatic cell counter (Cell Counter Sysmex 

F-520, Japan).  

Viability of the RBMSCs was also analyzed with a NucleoCounter (ChemoMetec A/S, Denmark) as 

described elsewhere [33].  

2.4.2. Cytotoxicity screening of the HAp and SPCL scaffolds  

A luminescent cell viability assay [24] based on the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) quantification was 

performed in order to evaluate the viability of RBMSCs seeded onto the surface of the HAp and SPCL 

scaffolds. Prior to RBMSCs seeding, the HAp and SPCL scaffolds were pretreated (de-airation) to 

prevent air bubble formation in the pores. Scaffolds were placed in 10 mL polystyrene tubes with 

ventilation caps. MEM medium was added and scaffolds were de-aired under vacuum using a 20 mL 

syringe with an attached 21G needle. Then, each scaffold was transferred into the respective well of a 

non-adherent 96-well tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) plate. RBMSCs (P1) were seeded onto the 



CHAPTER VIII. The osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells cultured with dexamethasone-loaded 

carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles 

 
 

- 291 - 
 

surface of the HAp and SPCL scaffolds at a cell density of 5 x 102 cells/scaffold, 1 x 103 cells/scaffold,   

5 x 103 cells/scaffold and 1 x 104 cells/scaffold, and cultured in MEM medium under static conditions for 

24 hrs, 3 and 7 d. After each time period, the ATP content which signals the presence of metabolically 

active cells was measured by means of performing a CellTiter-Glo® luminescent cell viability assay 

(Promega Corporation, USA). Luminescence was measured in a microplate reader (Wallac ARVOsx 

1420, Perkin-Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, USA), following the protocol provided by the supplier. 

All experiments were carried out 3 times using 3 replicates per experimental condition.  

2.4.3. Assessment of proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of RBMSCs seeded onto the surface of 

the HAp and SPCL scaffolds and cultured with Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles 

RBMSCs were isolated and expanded as mentioned above. HAp and SPCL scaffolds were placed in 

each well of a 96-well TCPS plate. Then, 1 x 106 RBMSCs (P1) were added per each HAp and SPCL 

scaffold, and the constructs were cultured in complete MEM medium under standard culture conditions 

for the period of 12 hrs to allow cell adhesion. After that time, cell-scaffold constructs were transferred to 

a non-treated and non-protein coated flat bottom 12-well TCPS plate (Nunc, Japan), the different culture 

medium was added, and RBMSCs were cultured for times up to 14 d. RBMSCs were exposed to a 

MEM medium supplemented with 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles, 

0.28 mM ascorbic acid (Wako Pure Chemicals, Japan) and 10 mM ?-glycerophosphate (Sigma, USA). 

RBMSCS were also cultured in a complete MEM medium (negative control for osteogenic 

differentiation). A complete MEM medium supplemented with 10-8 M Dex, 0.28 mM ascorbic acid and 10 

mM ?-glycerophosphate was used as the positive control for osteogenic differentiation. All experiments 

were carried out 3 times using a minimum of 3 replicates per experimental condition.  

2.4.4. LIVE/DEAD viability assay 

Cell adhesion and proliferation was also investigated with a LIVE/DEAD viability assay kit (Molecular 

Probes, USA) after 14 d of culturing. RBMSCs-scaffold constructs were incubated with two probes, 

calcein-AM (green colour) and ethidium homodimer-1 (bright red colour), for intracellular esterase 

activity and plasma membrane integrity, respectively [34]. Then, RBMSCs-scaffold construct specimens 

were washed with Ca and Mg-free PBS solution and observed under a 3-D fluorescence microscope 

(Olympus SZX12 stereomicroscope, OLYMPUS Co. Ltd., Japan). RBMSCs-scaffold constructs 

specimens were also prepared for SEM observation using standard fixative and dehydration methods.

2.4.5. DNA quantification 

DNA quantification was performed using the nuclear dye Hoechst 33258 (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) 

according to the method previously described [34]. Prior to the assay, the RBMSCs-scaffold constructs 

were washed with a Ca and Mg-free PBS solution. Then, constructs were transferred to a 2 mL 

eppendorf, pulverized with zirconia’s balls (milling time of ~2 min at 25 shakes.s-1) using a ball mixer mill 

(Retsch GmbH, Germany), and sonicated in 0.2% Triton-X (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) solution for 5 min. 

Finally, the samples were sonicated and the DNA quantification carried out. The standard DNA solutions 

were prepared using salmon sperm DNA (Invitrogen, USA). 

2.4.6. Qualitative analysis of mineralization 

Alizarin red S staining was performed to investigate possible calcium deposition after 14 d of culturing. 

RBMSCs-scaffold construct specimens were washed twice with Ca and Mg-free PBS solution and cells 

fixed with 95% ethanol for 15 min [35]. The fixed cells were then washed once with PBS and stained with 

5 mg.mL-1 Alizarin red S in Ca and Mg-free PBS solution for 5 min at room temperature. After a washing 

step with ultra-pure water, RBMSCs-scaffold construct specimens were examined under a 3-D 

fluorescence microscope. 

2.4.7. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of alkaline phosphatase (ALP)  

ALP activity was investigated either, qualitatively and quantitatively in order to evaluate osteoblastic 

differentiation. For the ALP staining the RBMSCs-scaffold construct specimens were washed twice with 

PBS, after 14 d of culturing. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/Ca and Mg-free PBS solution 

for 15 min at 4?C. The RBMSCs-scaffold construct specimens were washed twice with AMP buffer (56 

mM of 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol in ultra-pure water, pH 9.9) and then soaked with staining 

solution 0.5 mg naphtol AS-MX phosphate and 0.5 mg fast red violet LB salt per mL, in AMP buffer. 

RBMSCs-scaffold construct specimens were incubated for 10 min at room temperature, washed with Ca 

and Mg-free PBS solution and examined under a 3-D fluorescence microscope.  

The remaining sonicated suspensions obtained from the DNA quantification assay were used to 

determine ALP levels. Prior to analysis the samples were sonicated once and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm 

for 1 min at 4?C. To each well of a 96-well plate was added an aliquot of supernatant and p-nytrophenyl 

phosphate substrate (ZYMED® Laboratories, Invitrogen, USA), following the method described 

elsewhere [33] with minor modifications. Standards were prepared with p-nytrophenol, pNP. Triplicates 



CHAPTER VIII. The osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells cultured with dexamethasone-loaded 

carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles

were made for each sample and standard. Absorbance was read at 405 nm (Wallac ARVOsx 1420, 

Perkin-Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, USA), and sample concentrations were read off from the 

standard graph. Enzyme activity was expressed as nmol of pNP released/scaffold/30 min and 

normalized by DNA content. 

2.4.8. Osteocalcin content determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 

The remnants of each sample used for the ALP/DNA assays were treated with a 20% formic acid 

solution and stored at 4?C for 2-3 d. After that time, samples were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min 

at 4?C. The supernatant was passed through a SephadexTM G-25 column (GE healthcare, Sweden) for 

de-salting, and concentrated in order to carry out the ELISA assay. A Rat Osteocalcin EIA kit (N? BT-

460, Biomedical Technologies Inc., MA, USA) was used following the instructions provided by the 

supplier. Data was read off from the standard curve obtained with human osteocalcin and expressed as 

ng of deposited osteocalcin per ?g of DNA. 

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

3.1. MORPHOLOGY OF THE HAP AND SPCL SCAFFOLDS, AND DEX-LOADED CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER 

NANOPARTICLES 

It is well known that the ability of a scaffold to support cells proliferation and differentiation is one of the 

key issues for the success of a tissue engineered cells-scaffold construct. In the current work, an 

extensive in vitro study was carried out in order to investigate the effect of the intracellular delivery of 

dexamethasone by the carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer (Dex-loaded 

CMCht/PAMAM) nanoparticles supplemented from a culture medium on the proliferation and osteogenic 

differentiation of RBMSCs when cultured onto the surface of two types of scaffolds. From Figure 1, it is 

possible to observe the microstructure of the HAp (A-B) and SPCL (C-D) scaffolds examined under 

SEM. Figures 1A-B revealed that the architecture of the obtained HAp scaffolds possess a trabeculae-

like structure and highly interconnected macropores. Figures 1C-D show the typical SPCL 

macroporosity, which can be obtained by randomly assembling the fibres. The polymeric scaffolds also 

exhibited a high level of interconnectivity. 

Several groups [27,29,31] have shown that these scaffolds exhibit adequate porosity and mechanical 

properties to support cell adhesion and proliferation and  tissue ingrowth upon implantation of the 

construct. Moreover, we have also demonstrated that these starch-based scaffolds are biodegradable,

and thus have the potential to be used in tissue engineering strategies to regenerate bone tissue 

defects. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 1. SEM micrographs of the HAp (A-B) and SPCL (C-D) scaffolds. 

Figure 2 shows the 3-D micro-computed tomography images of the HAp and SPCL scaffolds. This study 

revealed that the HAp scaffolds possess a mean porosity of 67.8 ± 5.1% and pore size in the range of 

50-600 ?m. The SPCL scaffolds showed a mean porosity of 67.4 ± 1.3% and pore size in the range of 

50-1000 ?m. The selected scaffolds present a similar porosity and pore size as well as high levels of 

interconnectivity, which is ideal for carrying out a comparative study in terms of scaffold composition as 

these features play a critical role in bone formation in vitro and in vivo [36]. Issues that will not be 

addressed in the present work are of course related to the mechanical properties and degradation rate 

of the scaffolds, but more details on this can be found elsewhere [31]. 

Figure 3 shows the TEM image of the developed Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. 

It can be seen that the novel macromolecular nanocarriers possess a dendron-like morphology. These 

have been shown to be effective in the loading and controlled release of Dex [24]. In this study, we have 

also demonstrated that the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles did not exhibit

significant cytotoxicity in the range of concentrations below 1 mg.mL-1 and fluorescent probe labeled 

nanoparticles were found to be internalized with high efficiency by different cell types. In this first study, 

we also proved that the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles promote the osteogenic 

differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells in a 2-D system, in vitro.

3.2. RAT BONE MARROW STROMAL CELLS VIABILITY, ADHESION AND PROLIFERATION 

A luminescent cell viability assay based on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) quantification was performed 

to evaluate the viability of RBMSCs seeded at different cell densities onto the surface of the HAp and 

SPCL scaffolds, and results are disclosed in Figure 4.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 4. Cell viability assay of RBMSCs seeded at different cell densities onto the surface of the HAp 

and SPCL scaffolds after 24 hrs, 3 d and 7 d: (C1) 5 x 102 cells/scaffold (C2) 1 x 103 cells/scaffold, (C3) 

5 x 103 cells/scaffold, and (C4) 1 x 104 cells/scaffold. Cell numbers correlate with luminescence.  

Results expressed as an average ± standard deviation, n=9. 

This assay is a feasible test for assessing the cytotoxicity of materials, since it signals the presence of 

metabolically active cells. Results have shown that the HAp and SPCL materials are not cytotoxic over 

RBMSCs. As seen in the present work, no significant differences in the RBMSCs viability were observed 

when culturing on the surface of the HAp as compared to the SPCL scaffolds. By its turn, it is possible 

to observe that the initial RBMSCs seeding density affects the viability (ATP content) of RBMSCs.  

Additional studies were carried out to evaluate the capacity of HAp and SPCL scaffolds to support the 

proliferation and differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells (RBMSCs) after exposure to Dex-

loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. In the present paper, RBMSCs proliferation was 

investigated by DNA quantification (Figure 5). From that figure it is possible to observe that the cell 

seeding efficiency is similar for HAp and SPCL scaffolds as observed by the DNA content after 12 hrs of 

culturing. However, a slightly higher cellular density was detected for the HAp as compared to that for

RBMSCs. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 5. DNA content of RBMSCs seeded (1 x 106 cells/scaffold) onto the surface of the HAp (left) and 

SPCL (right) scaffolds and cultured for 12 hrs, 7 and 14 d, in different culture media: (A, B and E) 

Complete MEM medium; (C, F) MEM medium supplemented with 10-8 M Dex, 0.28 mM ascorbic acid 

and 10 mM ?-glycerophosphate (osteogenic medium); (D, G) MEM medium with 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-

loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles, 0.28 mM ascorbic acid and 10 mM                             

?-glycerophosphate. Results expressed as an average ± standard deviation, n=9. 

To a certain extent, this observation may also be related with the fact that proliferation rates are reduced 

during differentiation [37], as seen by lower cell numbers in cultures when osteogenic factors were 

present. Then, RBMSCs-scaffold constructs were also examined under microscopic analyses in order to 

assess cell adhesion and proliferation, after 14 d of culturing (Figure 6). It is possible to observe a 

higher cellular density on the surface of the HAp as compared to the SPCL. This data thus reflects the 

findings of the DNA quantification. This data also indicates that cells adhere perfectly, spread actively, 

and present a flattened morphology (*). Moreover, the (calcein-AM, green colour) images of the 

RBMSCs-HAp and -SPCL construtcs revealed that cells were alive, after 14 d. Despite the high cellular 

density it is clear that cells did not obstruct the pores of either. This is an important condition, since the 

overall performance of the construct [38-40] may be affected by limiting the diffusion of nutrients, oxygen, 

and metabolites to or from its core.

3.3. EFFECT OF THE DEX-LOADED CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES ON THE OSTEOGENIC 

DIFFERENTIATION OF RAT BONE MARROW STROMAL CELLS 

In the present study we have also investigated the osteogenic differentiation of RBMSCs seeded onto 

the surface of the HAp and SPCL scaffolds that were cultured in: (i) absence of Dex and, (ii) with Dex 

delivered as a medium supplement and via cellular uptake using the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles. Mendes et al. [29] showed that the SPCL supports the proliferation and osteogenic 

differentiation of RBMSCs, in vitro. Despite the in vitro and in vivo characterization on the performance 

of the SPCL scaffolds, the report lacks in quantitative data. To our knowledge, no qualitative and 

quantitative studies were performed to investigate the effect of combining Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM 

SPCL scaffolds HAp scaffolds

dendrimer nanoparticles and both HAp and SPCL scaffolds (3-D system) on the osteogenic 

differentiation of the RBMSCs, in vitro. 

Production of mineral deposits is an important indicator of osteogenesis and osteogenic differentiation 

[41,42]. In order to be able to assess mineralization, calcium staining (Alizarin red) and SEM analyses of 

RBMSCs-scaffold constructs cultured in different culture media were carried out (Figure 7).

At 14 d, it was possible to observe a higher calcium deposition in the RBMSCs-scaffold constructs 

exposed to Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles as compared to that of RBMSCs-

scaffold constructs cultured in the standard culture medium (Figures 7I, K, and E, G). The extent of 

mineralization in cultures exposed to Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles at a final 

concentration of 0.01 mg.mL-1 was of the same magnitude as for cultures exposed to a standard 

osteogenic media (Figures 7I, K and M, O). Moreover, from SEM images it is possible to observe the 

typical mineralized nodules (Figures 7J, L and N, P), which are not seen in RBMSCs-scaffold constructs 

cultured in complete MEM medium (Figures 7F, H).  

Finally, the osteoblastic phenotype expression levels were evaluated both, qualitatively and 

quantitatively for alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, which are known to be the early and late 

markers of osteogenic differentiation [43], respectively. It is well known that Dex triggers the osteogenic 

differentiation of MSCs at an early stage and directs the cells toward terminal maturation at the late 

stages of differentiation and matrix mineralization [44]. Thus, we hypothesized that the continuous 

exposure of RBMSCs to Dex via the sustained release from the nanoparticles, either intracellularly or in 

culture media results in the differentiation of RBMSCs into mature osteoblasts. Figure 8 shows the ALP 

staining of RBMSCs-scaffold constructs after culturing in a different culture medium for a period of 14 d. 

As seen for mineralization, the ALP activity is higher for cultures in which RBMSCs were exposed to 

Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and osteogenic medium (Figures 8E, F and G, H). 

These findings demonstrate strong evidence that osteogenic differentiation only occured in cultures with 

Dex either, supplemented from culture media and delivered via the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles.  

The ALP activity per DNA content of the HAp (top) and SPCL (bottom) scaffolds seeded with RBMSCs 

and cultured in different culture media for a period of 12 hrs, 7 and 14 d is presented in Figure 9. It is 

possible to observe that ALP activity is increased in cultures where RBMSCs-scaffold constructs were 

exposed to Dex, i.e. Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles, and osteogenic medium. The 

present data is not surprising, since the in vitro release studies of Dex from the CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles [24] revealed that Dex concentration resembles to that of osteogenic media. In 

addition, a significant increase in the ALP activity of RBMSCs-HAp scaffold constructs that were 

cultured with Dex delivered via the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles was observed as compared 

to the constructs supplemented with Dex in culture media, after 7 d. In contrast, the ALP activity is 

higher when RBMSCs are cultured with 10-8 M Dex supplied from culture medium (Figure 9 bottom, F), 

after 14 d.

medium with 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles, 0.28 mM ascorbic acid 

and 10 mM ?-glycerophosphate; (G, H) MEM medium supplemented with 10-8 M Dex 0.28 mM ascorbic 

acid and 10 mM ?-glycerophosphate (osteogenic medium). 

No significant differences in the ALP activity were observed for RBMSCs-SPCL scaffold constructs, 

after 7 d although, sub-figure 9 (bottom, G) shows a higher ALP activity in the RBMSCs-SPCL 

constructs that were cultured with Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles after 14 d. We 

have also observed that ALP activity is higher for the RBMSCs-HAp constructs as compared to that for 

the RBMSCs-SPCL constructs. Thus, results demonstrated that Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles combined with HAp enhance osteogenesis by increasing ALP activity and mineralization 

of the extracellular matrix. Therefore, the present data show that the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM

In its turn, this data corroborates previous works [27,42,45] that demonstrated the important role of HAp in 

the adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of the RBMSCs, in vitro and in vivo. This data 

is not surprising since HAp which has a crystal structure similar to that of bone mineral [46], and is 

considered the ‘gold-standard’ of the osteoconductive materials. The obtained results also 

demonstrated that SPCL scaffolds are effective in supporting the osteogenic differentiation of RBMSCs, 

since ALP activity is in the same order of magnitude to that of RBMSCs-HAp constructs. On the other 

hand, the SPCL scaffolds has been shown [31] to be degraded enzymatically, which allows an increase 

in the scaffold porosity over time and consequently may favour tissue ingrowth during implantation time. 

Figure 10 shows the content of the late osteogenic marker and bone-specific osteocalcin normalized by 

DNA content of RBMSCs cultured onto the surface of the HAp (top) and SPCL (bottom) scaffolds and 

exposed to a different culture medium for the period of 12 hrs, 7 and 14 d.  

This data corroborates the previous ALP assay demonstrating that RBMSCs differentiate into 

osteoblasts when culturing in the presence of Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and 

osteogenic medium. However, no significant differences in osteocalcin content were observed for the 

RBMSCs-HAp and RBMSCs-SPCL scaffold constructs supplemented with Dex delivered via the 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and free in culture media, after 7 and 14 d of culturing. In the 

light of these results, we have shown that RBMSCs proliferated well, and both differentiate into 

osteoblasts and organize into a mineralized matrix by combining Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles and scaffolds (3-D systems), in vitro.  

This work has demonstrated the efficacy of the system Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles and scaffolds in promoting the proliferation and osteodifferentiation of RBMSCs, and the 

success in the intracellular delivery of Dex, in vitro. Thus, it is conceivable that intracellular controlled 

drug delivery using biodegradable nanocarriers or cell-based carrying nanoparticles strategies may be 

an excellent candidate for in vivo TE applications, as these nanosystems may possibly to: (i) reduce the 

drug dosage needs and, (ii) improve efficacy, since the drug would only concentrate in the 

damaged/diseased cells and tissues.

In this work we demonstrate the biological performance of previously prepared macroporous HAp and 

SPCL scaffolds. These have shown to be adequate for culturing RBMSCs, namely for adhesion,

proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. Results showed that the RBMSCs proliferation and 

osteogenic differentiation are favored when cultured onto the surface of the HAp scaffolds, but the 

results obtained for SPCL are quite similar and much better than one could expect for a biodegradable 

polymer. On the other hand, the biochemical data presented herein demonstrated that the Dex-loaded 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles enhanced the early osteogenic differentiation of RBMSCs, in 

vitro. Therefore, the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles may be used as intracellular 

nanocarriers of biological agents being able to modulate the behaviour of stem cells.

Ex vivo culturing of rat bone marrow stromal cells with dexamethasone-loaded 

carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles enhances ectopic bone 

formation on tissue engineered constructs 

Abstract 

Recently, our group has proposed a combinatorial strategy in tissue engineering principles employing 

carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles (CMCht/PAMAM) towards the 

intracellular release and regimented supply of dexamethasone (Dex) aimed at control stem cells 

osteogenic differentiation in the absence of typical osteogenic inducers, in vivo. In this work, we have 

investigated if the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles could play a crucial role in the 

regulation of osteogenesis, in vivo. Macroporous hydroxylapatite (HAp) scaffolds were seeded with rat 

bone marrow stromal cells (RBMSCs), whose cells were expanded in MEM medium supplemented with 

0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and implanted subcutaneously on 

the back of rats for the period of 2 and 4 weeks. HAp porous ceramics without RBMSCs and 

RBMSCs/HAp scaffold constructs seeded with cells expanded in the presence and absence of 10-8 M 

Dex were used as controls. The effect of initial cell number seeded in the HAp scaffolds on the bone 

forming ability of the constructs was also investigated. Qualitative and quantitative new bone formation 

was evaluated using micro-computed tomography analysis of the implants, Haematoxylin &amp;amp; Eosin 

staining of the implant sections and histomorphometrical analysis. Toluidine blue staining was also 

carried out to investigate the synthesis of proteoglycan extracellular matrix. In addition, alkaline 

phosphatase and osteocalcin levels were quantified, since these markers denote osteogenic 

differentiation. At four-weeks post-implantation results have shown that the novel Dex-loaded 

carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles may be beneficial as intracellular 

nanocarrier, supplying Dex in a regimented manner leading to superior ectopic de novo bone formation. 

The superior role of the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles in enhancing new bone 

formation was particularly evident when seeding 2 x 105 RBMSCs per HAp scaffold.

1. INTRODUCTION 

A variety of hydroxylapatite (HAp) ceramics with controlled architectures [1-3] has been developed for find 

applications as bone substitutes in clinic. Despite, their interesting architecture namely pore size, shape 

and interconnectivity, mechanical properties and important biological role in the in vivo performance, 

these porous implants lack on their osteoinductive capacity [4-6]. In this regard, it has been shown that 

porous HAp ceramics alone, do not induce bone formation in soft tissues when implanted in rabbits [7], 

or upon subcutaneous implantation in mice [8,9], rats [10-12] and goats [13]. By its turn, bone marrow 

stromal cells (BMSCs) have shown to inherently possess a huge therapeutic potential [14-20]. Therefore, 

in bone tissue engineering strategies, combination of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) with porous 

scaffolds [10,11,13,21] and use of bioreactors [22,23], have been widely explored as possible alternatives. On 

the other hand, it has been shown that glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone (Dex) has an essential 

role for osteoblast differentiation and matrix mineralization [24-26]. In fact, it has been reported that Dex 

regulation depends on the degree of cellular differentiation, the donor species, and dosage, dose 

duration and dosing regimen [27]. Several authors [9,10,28] reported that stem cells need to be under the 

influence of such type of osteogenic factors for superior de novo bone formation. Actually, cell-scaffold 

constructs showed bone formation within the pores of the scaffolds when constructs were in vitro 

cultured under osteogenic factors post-implantation [10,11]. However, the long culturing time is a major 

drawback of this strategy and may not be the most feasible for satisfactorily meet clinical demands. In 

addition, we foresee that cells may not maintain in vivo the cellular phenotype upon withdrawal of Dex, 

since Dex acts at both early and late stages to direct proliferative osteoprogenitor cells toward terminal 

maturation [29]. Therefore, a great deal of attention has been paid for finding alternative approaches to 

improve the limited cell-derived osteogenesis. In this context, we have been hypothesizing that the      

ex vivo culturing of stem cells with functional nanoparticles which can be efficiently taken up by cells 

may influence their cellular fate in the absence of typical osteogenic inducers, in vivo. It has been shown  

that glucocorticoids such as Dex bind to and triggers the cytoplasmatic glucocorticoid receptor [30,31]. 

Thus, we expect that the culturing of stem cells in the presence of nanoparticles that release Dex from 

inside, and in a regimented manner may be an effective strategy for in vivo control of stem cells 

osteogenic differentiation and maturation. In this regard, we have surface engineered low generation 

poly(amidoamine) dendrimers with carboxymethylchitosan, CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles 

and loaded them with Dex [32]. These are expected to possess high payload, and improved 

biocompatibility when compared to that of typical dendrimers. The use of Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM

dendrimer nanoparticles enhances ectopic bone formation on tissue engineered constructs

dendrimer nanoparticles can also allow avoid the need and frequency of drug administration since Dex 

is available at the target site, and thus possibly minimize the undesired side-effects [31].  

In previous in vitro studies [32,33], we have shown the high efficiency of Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles on being internalized by different cell types. The Dex release profile from the 

CMCht/PAMAM nanoparticles was monitored, in the presence and absence of serum proteins at 

physiological pH. This study has shown that Dex is released as free drug in the range of concentrations 

similar to that of typical osteogenic cocktails. Complementarily, we demonstrated their role in promoting 

the osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells (RBMSCs) in tissue culture polystyrene, 

TCPS dishes.  

Our group [34] has recently developed HAp scaffolds with macroporous structure and reported that these 

scaffolds are biocompatible and efficiently support the adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic 

differentiation of RBMSCs in the presence of 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles, in vitro [35]. Thus, the HAp scaffolds have shown in vitro to possess suitable 

physicochemical and biological properties for being used in bone tissue engineering approaches. To 

further evaluate the in vivo performance of the cell-scaffold constructs, several groups [10,11,28,36] have 

been proposing the well established ectopic implantation model in rats. This is a cost effective model [37] 

and allows to avoid the presence of growth factors found at the orthotopic site whose influences may 

affect the performances of the constructs [38]. 

In the current experimental study, we investigate if the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles play a crucial role in the regulation of osteogenesis, in vivo. We therefore used 

RBMSCs/HAp constructs where cells were exposed to 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles during the expansion time (Figure 1, top) and assess their efficiency in 

promoting the osteogenic differentiation and de novo bone formation upon subcutaneous implantation 

on the back of rats for the period of 2 and 4 weeks. HAp porous ceramics and RBMSCs/HAp constructs 

seeded with different cells number and cultured either, presence and absence of Dex were used as 

controls for elucidating the role of the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles in promoting 

osteogenesis. Micro-computed tomography analysis was performed to investigate new bone formation 

in the RBMSCs/HAp constructs. Histological studies were also carried out using Haematoxylin &amp;amp; Eosin 

staining. Histomorphometrical analysis of the implants sections was performed to quantify new bone 

formation. Toluidine blue staining was also performed to investigate the synthesis of proteoglycan 

extracellular matrix. Complementarily, osteoblastic phenotype expression levels were determined by

quantification of the surface-membrane alkaline phosphatase (ALP) glycoprotein and osteocalcin, the 

early and late markers of osteogenic differentiation, respectively [39,40]. 

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  

2.1. PREPARATION OF THE HYDROXYLAPATITE (HAP) SCAFFOLDS AND SYNTHESIS OF DEXAMETHASONE-LOADED 

CARBOXYMETHYLCHITOSAN/POLY(AMIDOAMINE) DENDRIMER (DEX-LOADED CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER 

NANOPARTICLES)  

Sintered HAp scaffolds with 5 mm diameter and 4 mm height were obtained by means of impregnating a 

polyurethane (PU, Eurospuma S.A., Portugal) sponge with HAp powders, as previously reported [34,41,42]. 

Carboxymethylchitosan was synthesized by a chemical modification route of chitin (Sigma, Germany) as 

described by Chen et al. [43]. Starburst® poly(amidoamine)-carboxylic terminated dendrimers,     

PAMAM-CT (generation 1.5, 20% (w/v) methanolic solution) with an ethylenediamine core were 

purchased from Aldrich (Germany). Dexamethasone-loaded carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) 

dendrimer nanoparticles (Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM) were prepared in a stepwise manner as 

described elsewhere [32].  

Prior to the in vitro cell culture the HAp scaffolds and Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles were sterilized under an ethylene oxide gas atmosphere.  

2.2. IN VITRO CELL CULTURE 

2.2.1. Isolation and expansion of rat bone marrow stromal cells (RBMSCs)  

Seven-week-old Fischer 344/N male rats (Japan SLC Inc., Shizuoka, Japan) were sacrificed by 

administrating an excess of anesthesia, in accordance to the Ethics Committee at the Tissue 

Engineering Research Center (Amagasaki, Japan). The marrow plugs in the femoral shafts were flush 

out using Eagle’s minimum essential medium (MEM, Nacalai Tesque, Japan) supplemented with 15% 

fetal bovine serum (FBS, JRH Biosciences, USA) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (A/B, Nacalai Tesque, 

Japan) solution, as previously reported [44]. RBMSCs were transferred to T75 cm2 culture flask and 

expanded in the presence of different culture medium: complete MEM medium, MEM medium 

supplemented with 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and  MEM 

medium supplemented with 10-8 M dexamethasone at 37ºC in a 5% CO2 incubator. The culture medium 

was changed within 3 days to remove non-adherent cells. Then, culture medium was changed each 2 or 

3 days.

2.2.2. Seeding of RBMSCs onto the surface of the HAp scaffolds 

The RBMSCs (passage 1, P1) were released from substratum with 1 mL of 0.05% tripsin-0.53 mM 

EDTA (Invitrogen, USA) and centrifuged at 900 rpm for 5 minutes, after reach confluence. The 

supernatant was aspirated and cells re-suspended with 10 mL of complete culture medium. Cell 

concentration was determined using an automatic cell counter (Cell Counter Sysmex F-520, Japan). 

Prior seeding, the viability of the RBMSCs was also analyzed with a NucleoCounter (ChemoMetec A/S, 

Denmark) [45]. In addition, the HAp scaffolds were de-aired in MEM medium under vacuum [35]. Then, 

one scaffold was placed in a well of a 96-well TCPS plate and RBMSCs seeded in a drop-wise manner. 

RBMSCs expanded in complete MEM medium, MEM medium supplemented with 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-

loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and MEM medium supplemented with 10-8 M 

dexamethasone were seeded onto each HAp scaffold. The effect of cell density was evaluated by 

seeding different cell numbers (1 x 106 and 2 x 105) onto the HAp scaffolds. Finally, RBMSCs/HAp 

scaffolds constructs were cultured in complete MEM medium under standard culture conditions to allow 

cell adhesion, for the period of 12 hours.  

2.3. IN VIVO STUDY 

2.3.1. Subcutaneous implantation 

Seven-week-old male Fisher 344 rat (Syngeneic F344/N rat), same as donor sub-strain and age, were 

anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (Nembutal, Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., 

Japan) at a final concentration of 3.5 mg per 100 g of body weight. The hair of the rat was cut at the 

implantation area, followed by washing with tap water and scrubbed with tincture of iodine and 70% 

ethanol. In each rat, three or four skin incisions (each 1 cm length) on the dorsal midline below the ear 

were made. Each RBMSCs/HAp construct was implanted subcutaneously (1.5 to 2 cm away from the 

midline at both right and left sides) into the respective pocket and skin sutured. As a negative control, 

we used HAp implants without RBMSCs. No prophylactic medication was administered post-surgery.  

After 2 and 4 weeks implantation, the animals were sacrificed with an overdose of anesthetic and the 

implants retrieved. All experiments were carried out 3 times. 

2.3.2. Micro-computed tomography analysis 

New bone formation in the retrieved implants was investigated by micro-computed tomography analysis 

(?-CT: MCT-CB 100MF(Z); Hitachi Medical Corp., Tokyo, Japan). After 2 and 4 weeks of implantation,

dendrimer nanoparticles enhances ectopic bone formation on tissue engineered constructs 

 
 

- 317 - 
 

implants were retrieved, rinsed with PBS, and fixed with 10 % formalin at room temperature, overnight. 

Constructs were placed on the flat surface for analysis under the ?-CT. X-ray scans were acquired with 

a resolution mode of 10 µm (x/y/z) at 50 kV and 150 ?A. The analytical conditions were: precision 

mode, 7 times magnification with an image intensifier field of 4.57 cm [46]. CT reconstruction has carried 

out using the 3-D Bone Morphometry (TRI/3D-Bon, RATOC System Engineering Co. Ltd., Tokyo, 

Japan) software for evaluate the 2-D distribution of newly formed bone within the pores of the explants.  

2.3.3. Histological evaluation of the explants 

After ?-CT, implants were decalcified with K-CX solution (Falma Co., Tokyo, Japan) for histological 

analysis. Firstly, the constructs were dehydrated in an ascending series grade ethanol/water solution 

(from 90-100%) using an automatic machine for 19 hours followed by washing three times with xylene. 

Then, specimens were immersed in paraffin at 62ºC and allowed to solidify at -5ºC. Slides were 

prepared by cutting the specimens into sections 5 ?m thick using a microtome, and mounted in a micro-

slide glass (Matsunami glass Ind. Ltd., Japan). Paraffin was melt by placing the slides in the oven at 

71ºC for 20 minutes and allowed to let cool down at room temperature. The remnant paraffin was then 

eliminated off in hexane for 5 minutes (S.T. Chemical, Japan), followed by dipping into a 

ethylene/propylene mixture (Clear Plus, Falma Co., Tokyo, Japan) for 3 minutes. Then, slides were 

immersed three times in 100% ethanol for 2 minutes each time of immersion.   

For the Haematoxylin &amp;amp; Eosin (H&amp;amp;E) staining, slides were sequentially transferred to a 90% ethanol and 

then to a 70% and washed with tap water. It followed the staining step, which consisted in the 

immersion of the slides into the GM’s Haematoxylin dye (Muto Pure Chemicals Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan, 

GM Haematoxylin Staining for H&amp;amp;E staining Nº 3008-1) for 10 minutes. It followed the washing step with 

tap water for 5 to 10 minutes. Then, slides were rinsed with de-ionized water and immersed in a 70% 

ethanol solution. Finally, slides were immersed in Eosin dye (Muto Pure Chemicals Co. Ltd, Tokyo, 

Japan Nº 3204-2) solution for 2 minutes and dehydrated in a series of ethanol grades (70%, 90%, and 

100%). At last were immersed three times in an ethylene/propylene mixture and then mounted avoiding 

the formation of bubbles for observation. 

For Toluidine blue staining, paraffin was melt and slides rinsed with ultrapure water. The ground 

sections were stained with 0.05% toluidine blue (Muto Pure Chemicals Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) for       

30 minutes. Finally, the slides were dehydrated in a series of ethanol grades (70%, 90%, and 100%) 

and mounted for further observation. All slides were examined under a light microscope (Olympus

DP70, Olympus Co. Ltd, Japan). 2-D histological sections are given for the same bone specimens used 

in the micro-computed tomography analysis. 

2.3.4. Histomorphometry 

Histomorphometrical analysis was carried out using the public domain image-processing program 

IMAGE J (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) to obtain quantitative evaluation of histological 

section of bone. The  light microscopy photographs of the 2-D histological decalcified sections of each 

sample were converted to gray-value images and several filter steps were performed [47]. Shrinkage 

percentage observed in decalcified sections [46] was not considered in the calculations. New bone 

formation (NB) was expressed as a percentage of bone volume density (BV/TSV, Bone volume/Tissue 

plus Scaffold volume) ± standard deviation. A minimum of 12 sections per implant were analyzed. 

2.3.5. Quantification of alkaline phosphatase (ALP)  

Alkaline phosphatase was measured to evaluate osteoblast differentiation. Prior to the assay, the 

explants were washed with Ca and Mg-free PBS solution. Then, implants were transferred to a 2 mL 

eppendorf and pulverized with zirconia’s balls as previously reported [35]. Prior to analysis the samples 

were sonicated and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 1 minute at 4?C. To each well of a 96-well plate was 

added an aliquot of supernatant and p-nytrophenyl phosphate substrate (ZYMED® Laboratories, 

Invitrogen, USA) [46]. The plate was then incubated in the dark for 30 minutes at 37ºC and after that time 

the reaction was stopped with 1 M NaOH (Panreac, Japan). Standards were prepared with                   

p-nytrophenol, pNP. Triplicates were made for each sample and standard. Absorbance was read at 405 

nm (Wallac ARVOsx 1420, Perkin-Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, USA), and sample 

concentrations were read off from the standard graph. Enzyme activity was expressed either as nmol of 

pNP released/explant/30 minutes. 

2.3.6. Quantification of osteocalcin 

The remnant of each sample used for the ALP assay was treated with a 20% formic acid solution and 

stored at 4?C for 2-3 days. Afterwards samples were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4?C. 

Then, the supernatant was passed through a SephadexTM G-25 column (GE healthcare, Sweden), 

subsequently concentrated for performing the Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A Rat 

Osteocalcin EIA kit (N? BT-460, Biomedical Technologies Inc., MA, USA) was used following the

instructions provided by the supplier. Data was read off from the standard curve obtained with human 

osteocalcin and expressed as ng of deposited osteocalcin per explant. 

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Recently, our group [32] has proposed the combinatorial strategy of tissue engineering principles with 

nanocarriers towards the intracellular release and regimented supply of Dex aimed at control the stem 

cells osteogenic differentiation in the absence of typical osteogenic cocktails, in vivo. In this context, we 

have shown that is possible to develop CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and load these 

macromolecules with Dex. The in vitro release studies have shown that Dex is released as free drug in 

the range of concentrations similar to that of typical osteogenic cocktails when using concentrations of 

nanoparticles in the range of 0.01 mg.mL-1. Moreover, we have shown that osteogenic differentiation 

occurs in RBMSCs seeded onto the HAp scaffolds in the presence of 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles, in vitro [35]. 

In the current work, we have investigated if the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles 

can allow improving in vivo bone formation. We therefore exposed RBMSCs to 0.01 mg.mL-1             

Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles during expansion time, seeded the RBMSCs onto 

the surface of the HAp scaffolds and implanted the constructs subcutaneously on the back of F344/N 

rats (Figure 1, top). The effect of cell number on the bone forming capacity was also investigated, since 

has been shown that influences ectopic bone formation [37]. Ohgushi et al. [45] observed that fresh 

RBMSCs cultured in the presence of Dex and seeded onto the HAp scaffolds can show a high level of in 

vivo bone-forming ability. Therefore, in this study we also used as control the RBMSCs/HAp constructs, 

where RBMSCs were pre-cultured in a MEM medium with Dex at a final concentration of 10-8 M. We 

preliminary assessed histologically, new bone formation on the RBMSCs/HAp constructs, after 2 weeks 

of subcutaneous implantation. At 2 weeks post-implantation no bone formation was detected in the 

RBMSCs/HAp constructs with RBMSCs expanded in complete MEM medium, MEM medium 

supplemented with 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and MEM 

medium supplemented with 10-8 M dexamethasone and HAp  scaffolds without cells (data not shown). 

Therefore, to observe the effect of pre-culturing RBMSCs in the presence of Dex-loaded 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles in the de novo bone formation, we implanted subcutaneously 

the RBMSCs/HAp constructs for 4 weeks.  

Figure 1 (bottom) shows the photograph of the RBMSCs/HAp construct in the back of the F344/N rats, 

where RBMSCs were pre-incubated with 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer

Massive areas of NB (gray areas) were detected in all RBMSCs/HAp scaffold constructs seeded with 1 

x 106 RBMSCs (Figures 2E, I and M) as compared to those of HAp constructs without cells (Figure 2A)

and RBMSCs/HAp constructs seeded with 2 x 105 RBMSCs (Figure 2C) that were pre-cultured in MEM 

medium. 

Figure 3 shows the light microscopy photographs of the different RBMSCs/HAp explants decalcified 

sections after 4 weeks of subcutaneous implantation, which were stained with Haematoxylin &amp;amp; Eosin. 

The histological findings showed extensive de novo bone formation inside the HAp pores with cuboid 

osteoblasts lining (black arrows) the forming bone matrix in all HAp scaffolds seeded with 1 x 106 

RBMSCs (Figures 3E, F, I, J, M, N), indicating an active bone formation site. In fact, it is also possible to 

observe the lacunar spaces and reminiscent osteocyte-like cells entrapped in the bone matrix (see 

Figures 3H, J and L). Thus, osteocytic lacunae in the lamellar bone are uniform and regularly distributed 

with osteoblasts forming a continuous layer of bone in a unidirectional way typical of mature bone (NB). 

In addition, we also detect new bone formation in the HAp scaffolds seeded with 2 x 105 RBMSCs that 

were previously expanded in the presence of 10-8 M Dex (Figures 3G-H) and 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles (Figures 3K-L). In the late, we can observe a higher new bone 

formation as compared to that of constructs seeded with RBMSCs that were expanded in the presence 

of 10-8 M (Figures 3G-H). This data thus confirm the µ-CT observations in Figure 2, which showed that 

the gray areas are in fact newly formed bone. From Figures 3A-B it can be seen that fibrovascular tissue 

(F) with fat cells was formed and there is no evidence of de novo bone formation within the scaffolds. No 

bone formation was also observed for the RBMSCs/HAp constructs seeded with 2 x 105 RBMSCs that 

were expanded in MEM medium (Figures 3C-D), thus once corroborating the µ-CT findings. Despite, 

this data shows the importance of the porous size and interpore connectivity on the cells in-growth since 

fibrovascular tissue can be seen in the core of the scaffolds. Moreover, we can also observe that bone 

formation in the implants seeded with 1 x 106 RBMSCs expanded in the presence of 10-8 M Dex for 7 

days, is restricted to the walls of the HAp scaffolds (Figure 3I). In addition, it can also be seen extensive 

formation of adipocytes (A) in inner part of the pores of the implants. This result is not surprisingly since 

Porter et al. [29] have shown that the sustained exposure of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) to Dex 

induce the maturation of an adipocyte subpopulation within BMSCs, in vitro. Actually, in their studies 

they proposed that these side effects can be reduced if Dex is supplied in a regimented manner. In fact 

this hypothesis is supported by our histological findings, since we can detect that the pores of the 

RBMSCs/HAp constructs, where cells were pre-cultured with Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles are completely filled with calcified bone like-matrix (Figure 3M), and the presence of 

adipocytes is decreased. Thus this data supports the idea that the supply of Dex in a regimented

manner may be an effective strategy to, on one hand avoid the RBMSCs adipogenic differentiation in 

the inner part of the pores and, on the other, direct RBMSCs towards osteogenic differentiation.

Several authors [8,10,48,49] have been considering that degradation rate, pore geometry and degree of 

interconnectivity are important features for successfully induce de novo bone formation, since they 

control the diffusion of oxygen, nutrients and metabolites to and from the cells. Therefore, the developed 

HAp scaffolds should own an adequate pore size and interconnectivity, since extensive new bone 

formation within the macropores was observed. From 2-D µ-CT images and histological findings we 

observe that new bone was connected at the interpores (Figures 2 and 3). It has been shown that the 

interpore connections below 3 µm do not allow cell migration and vascularization [50]. Actually, we may 

observe bone formation in the core (osteoconduction) of the HAp scaffolds which reveals that the 

scaffolds posses an adequate interpore size and connection.  

Figure 4 shows a representative light microscopy photograph of a decalcified section (H&amp;amp;E staining) of 

HAp scaffolds seeded with 1 x 106 RBMSCs which were expanded in MEM medium supplemented with 

0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles, after 4 weeks of subcutaneous 

implantation, and the respective imaging processing that was carried out to perform the 

histomorphometrical analyses.

Table 1 shows the percentage of bone volume density in the different implants determined from the 

histomorphometrical analysis of the 2-D histological sections. Results have shown that no bone 

formation was observed in the HAp scaffolds without RBMSCs and HAp seeded with 2 x 105 RBMSCs 

expanded in MEM medium. Bone volume density in HAp seeded with 1 x 106 RBMSCs expanded in 

MEM medium was 27.1 ± 7.1%. By its turn, HAp seeded with 2 x 105 and 1 x 106 RBMSCs expanded in 

MEM medium supplemented with 10-8 M Dex was 6.9 ± 4.7% and 36.4 ± 9.2%, respectively. Finally, 

HAp seeded with 2 x 105 and 1 x 106 RBMSCs expanded in MEM medium supplemented with 0.01 

mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles was 30.5 ± 6.0% and 38.1 ± 5.7%, 

respectively. This data shows that porous HAp ceramics alone do not induce bone formation upon 

subcutaneous implantation in the back of the F344/N rats. However by seeding bone marrow stromal 

cells (BMSCs) onto the scaffolds bone formation could be detected, when cell number was 1 x 106 cells.

Moreover, this study corroborates previous findings [24-26] that showed the role of Dex for superior de 

novo bone formation. Despite, in this work we have shown that Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles induced a higher new bone formation as compared to that of RBMSCs expanded in MEM 

medium supplemented with 10-8 M Dex, the typical concentration used in osteogenic media [44]. This is 

particularly evident when seeding low cell numbers onto the surface of the HAp scaffolds. Thus these 

findings demonstrate that Dex was available inside the RBMSCs and could be release from the 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles with an adequate profile. Our present data is relevant if we

consider that, to our knowledge, no reports have been shown pores of implanted ceramics completely 

filled with newly formed bone when seeded with low cell numbers, after 4 weeks of implantation. 

Nishikawa et al. [10] have demonstrated bone formation in the RBMSCs/HAp scaffolds after 2 weeks of 

ectopic implantation, but constructs were previously cultured in vitro in a osteogenic medium. On the 

other hand, Arinzeh et al. [8] observed low amounts of new bone formation in the HAp scaffolds seeded 

with 5 x 106 cells, and mainly restricted to peripheral pores, after 6 weeks.  

It has been reported [29,51,52] that sustained exposure of bone marrow stromal cells to Dex down-regulate 

collagen type I production in vitro both in humans and animal models. To further investigate 

proteoglycan extracellular matrix synthesis (ECM) [37], we stained the implants sections with the 

methacromatic toluidine blue (Figure 5). Methacromasia was weakly observed in implants where new 

bone formation was formed (Figures 5E-F, G-H, I-J, and K-L). The other implants had no such findings 

(Figures 5A-B, and C-D). However, enhanced methacromasia was evidenced in the RBMSCs/HAp 

constructs where RBMSCs were expanded in the presence of Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles (Figures 5M-N), which shows the ECM rich of proteoglycans. This data suggests that 

supply of Dex in a regimented manner can enhance proteoglycan extracellular matrix synthesis. No 

cartilaginous like-matrix [53] was observed. 

Osteoblast differentiation is accompanied by the differential and temporal expression of several 

osteoblastic markers such as ALP, osteopontin, collagen type I, and osteocalcin [39]. To demonstrate the 

quantitatively the osteogenic capacity of the different implants, we measured the ALP activity and 

osteocalcin contents, after 4 weeks of implantation. Figure 6 shows the ALP activity of the HAp scaffolds 

without RBMSCs and the several RBMSCs/HAp constructs post-implantation. As seen for bone 

formation, the ALP activity is higher in the HAp implants seeded with 1 x 106 RBMSCs as compared to 

that seeded with 2 x 105 RBMSCs. This data thus suggests that osteogenic differentiation did occur in 

cultures with and without Dex which corroborates previous histological findings. It can be seen that ALP 

is higher when RBMSCs were expanded in a culture medium with 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and 10-8 M Dex. In addition, no significant differences were 

observed between the implants seeded with 1 x 106 RBMSCs where RBMSCs were expanded in a 

culture medium with Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and 10-8 M Dex.

for proteoglycan extracellular matrix (ECM), in explants where new bone formation was detected.

scaffolds (A), HAp seeded with 2 x 105 RBMSCs (B), HAp seeded with 1 x 106 RBMSCs (C). Results 

expressed as an average ± standard deviation, n=9. 

On the contrary, significant differences in ALP activity were observed in the implants seeded with           

2 x 105 RBMSCs. It can be seen that ALP activity in the implants where RBMSCs were expanded in a 

culture medium with 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles presented 

higher ALP levels as compared to that of culture medium with 10-8 M Dex, which is consistent with the 

higher bone formation observed. In other words, our data are is in full agreement with previous findings 

[28,54], as we found that continuous  treatment with Dex consistently increases the ALP activity, which is 

an indication of the osteogenic commitment of RBMSCs. Thus, Dex induced the early osteoblastic 

differentiation and potentate new bone formation. Moreover, HAp scaffolds without RBMSCs and 

RBMSC/HAp constructs seeded with 2 x 105 RBMSCs expanded in MEM medium presents low ALP 

activities, which demonstrates the important role of Dex and cell number on the formation of new bone.  

Figure 7 shows the osteocalcin content of the RBMSCs/HAp constructs, after 4 weeks of subcutaneous 

implantation. Osteocalcin content is higher both when RBMSCs were expanded in a culture medium 

with 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and 10-8 M Dex as compared to 

that of implants where RBMSCs were cultured in MEM medium. Increasing osteocalcin expression 

indicated advancing differentiation. By its turn, as observed for ALP, osteocalcin content in the HAp 

scaffolds without cells is low, which explains the absence of bone formation. In addition, it is possible to 

observe that the osteocalcin content did not vary significantly in the implants where RBMSCs were

expanded in the same conditions but seeded with different cell number (B-C). Moreover, no significant 

differences were found in explants with RBMSCs exposed to Dex. These results can be explained by 

the unresponsiveness of osteocalcin to long-term exposure to Dex in our experimental study as this late 

osteoblastic marker appears to reach a maximum just before or during mineralized tissue formation [55].

It has been shown that the expression of osteocalcin increases [56] with mineral deposition, while ALP 

levels decreases [57]. In fact Porter et al. [29] reported that Dex induces the expression of bone 

sialoprotein, but not osteocalcin expression which may be stimulated through a different pathway. 

Despite, all these results confirmed the osteogenic capacity of the HAp scaffolds seeded with 1 x 106 

RBMSCs and showed that exposure of Dex prior and during implantation resulted in a superior new 

bone formation. Moreover, this study demonstrate that CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles could 

supply Dex to RBMSCS in a regimented manner, thus acting at both early and late stages to direct 

proliferative osteoprogenitor cells toward terminal maturation. The superior role of the Dex-loaded 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles in increasing the ALP levels was particularly evident when 

seeding 2 x 105 RBMSCs per HAp scaffold. 

4. CONCLUSIONS 

In this work, we have demonstrated that cell number and ex vivo culturing strategies greatly influences 

the osteogenesis and de novo bone formation, in vivo. RBMSCs expanded with 0.01 mg.mL-1

dexamethasone-loaded carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amido-amine) dendrimer nanoparticles and seeded 

at low cell number on the surface of the HAp scaffolds enhanced the ectopic bone formation, after 4 

weeks of subcutaneous implantation in the back of F344/N rats. This study reveals that the novel 

dexamethasone-carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles may be beneficial 

as intracellular nanocarrier and supply of Dex in a regimented manner to modulate and direct stem cells 

differentiation towards osteogenic phenotype, enhance proteoglycan extracellular matrix synthesis and 

superior ectopic de novo bone formation. The architecture of HAp scaffolds proved to be a good support 

for osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow derived osteoblast and bone formation, in vivo. Thus, the 

tissue engineering strategy proposed in this work showed to be effective on promoting de novo bone 

formation in vivo and avoid the long time of in vitro culturing in the presence of osteogenic cocktails 

which is seen as major drawback for most clinical applications.

CHAPTER X.  

Dexamethasone-loaded carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles 

induces osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells and ectopic bone formation  

Abstract 

Among the myriad of possibilities in bone tissue engineering, the development novel strategies that can 

stimulate stem cell differentiation to become osteoblasts in the absence of typical osteogenic cocktails in 

vivo, it is still regarded as a very appealing challenge. Biodegradable and biocompatible sphere-like 

nanoparticles were previously developed by means of grafting carboxymethylchitosan onto 

poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles). Such structures have been 

proposed to be used in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine as an intracellular drug delivery 

system of bioactive molecules to modulate stem cells fate in vivo, namely proliferation and 

differentiation. In this work deeper studies on the physicochemical properties and morphology of the 

nanoparticles were carried out, including proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), transmission 

electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta potential analyses. Upon 

dexamethasone (Dex) loading into the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles, we have assisted to a 

particle size increase, while no significant variation on the zeta potential was observed. Moreover, the 

effect of Dex loading on the viability of rat bone marrow stromal cells (RBMSCs) and internalization 

efficiency were also investigated by quantification of ATP and fluorescence studies, respectively. These 

studies reveal that Dex did not affect cells viability, but decrease nanoparticles internalization by 

RBMSCs, in vitro. Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles osteogenic potential and bone 

forming ability were also evaluated, in vitro and in vivo. In vitro studies revealed that mineralization 

occur in 2-D RBMSCs cultures exposed to the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles to 

an extent similar to that for osteogenic medium. For in vivo studies, RBMSCs were incubated with Dex-

loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles during the expansion period and the cells were then 

seeded onto the surface of starch-polycaprolactone (SPCL) scaffolds before being implanted 

subcutaneously into the back of Fischer 344 rats for 4 weeks. Interestingly, the µ-CT and morphometric 

analyses, histology (H&amp;amp;E staining), biochemical parameters denoting osteogenesis and mineral bone 

formation content, demonstrate the superior performance of the developed nanoparticle system for the 

intracellular delivery of Dex as it stimulate RBMSCs to produce superior bone mineral in the absence of 

the typical osteogenic supplements, in vivo.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Cell and tissue engineering [1-7] has benefited from the development of novel strategies that can 

stimulate and control cells functions, in vitro and in vivo. This issue it is still regarded as a very 

appealing challenge [4,8,9] since there is the need to target-deliver biological agents, including 

differentiation factors or genetic material towards modulating from inside stem cells behavior. 

Nanocarrier systems have generated a significant amount of interest in the ex vivo cell maintenance and 

co-culturing [10,11], and control of the cellular fate in vivo mainly due to their internalization efficiency, 

drug loading capacity, and to favorably modulate the solubility and pharmacokinetics of drugs [12-14].  

Likewise, a great deal of attention has been given [15,16] to understanding the fundamental problem of 

the entry and retention mechanisms of nanoparticles on mammalian cells since the nano-devices may 

be incorporated into membrane-bounded endosomes and fail to access the cytosolic cell targets.  In this 

regard, dendrimers have attracted growing interest as nanocarriers as they can pass through cell 

membranes [17-19]. Despite the interesting architecture and multivalency, it has been found [20] that high 

generation dendrimers are often cytotoxic. The designing of dendrimers for biological and medical 

applications has been exploited by many researchers [21-23]; however, a fundamental paradigm still 

remains: how can we improve dendrimers biocompatibility without compromising their multivalency?  

To the best of our knowledge, nanoparticle systems that are biocompatible, possess higher loading 

capacity, and allow the bulk incorporation of bioactive molecules of higher molecular weights and of 

different chemistry, while maintaining high internalization and transfection efficiency as compared to 

conventional dendrimers still have not been successfully developed. We focused our attention in this 

fundamental problem, and have been proposing a novel surface engineering strategy which consists of 

using a low generation dendrimer backbone grafted to the carboxymethylchitosan (CMCht), a natural 

amphoteric polyelectrolyte derived from chitosan, with the aim of obtaining copolymers of new 

architectures and physichochemical properties. We develop novel macromolecules [24] by grafting 

carboxymethylchitosan (CMCht) onto poly(amidoamine) dendrimers, the so-called CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles. This new class of nanobiomaterials has been proposed to act intracellularly in 

the control of the stem cells fate in vivo, in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications. 

However, this remains ‘proof-of-concept’ with previous report [24] showing that the surface engineering of 

PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles with the biodegradable CMCht possibly to manipulate the chemical 

composition and improve biocompatibility, thus avoiding the cytotoxic effects of high-generation 

dendrimers. Moreover, upon loading of dexamethasone (Dex), the dendron-like nanocarriers promote 

the osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells (RBMSCs), in vitro [24,25].

differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells and ectopic bone formation

Here we report deeper studies on the physicochemical characteristics of the novel nanoparticles, 

namely the influence of incorporating Dex, measured by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) 

spectroscopy. The effect of Dex loading on the architecture, Zeta potential and size of the nanoparticles 

was investigated under transmission electron microscope (TEM) and a particle size analyzer. A 

luminescent cell viability assay based on the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) quantification was carried 

for screening nanoparticles cytotoxicity over RBMSCs. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting and 

fluorescence microscopic studies were carried out to investigate the internalization efficiency of the Dex-

loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendron-like nanoparticles nanoparticles. Moreover, to further investigate on 

their osteogenic potential, in vitro and in vivo studies were performed. In vitro mineralization was 

evaluated by measuring the levels of calcein uptake. For in vivo studies, Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM 

dendron-like nanoparticles were exposed from culture media to RBMSCs during the expansion period. 

Then, RBMSCs were seeded onto the surface of starch-polycaprolactone (SPCL) scaffolds overnight 

followed by subcutaneous implantation in the back of Fischer 344 rats for 4 weeks. Bone formation was 

evaluated by micro-computed tomography and morphometric analyses, and histological studies 

(Haematoxylin &amp;amp; Eosin staining). Complementarily, biochemical analyses such as ALP activity, 

osteocalcin content and calcium assay were also carried out.  

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  

2.1. SYNTHESIS OF THE CARBOXYMETHYLCHITOSAN/POLY(AMIDOAMINE) (CMCHT/PAMAM) DENDRIMER 

NANOPARTICLES AND LOADING WITH DEXAMETHASONE (DEX)  

Carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer, CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were 

prepared in a stepwise manner as described elsewhere [24]. A CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles 

solution was mixed with dexamethasone (Dex) at final concentration of 5x10-5 M, under agitation. Dex-

loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were obtained by a precipitation route. Then, 

precipitate was collected by filtration, dialyzed and freeze-dried (Telstar-Cryodos -80, Spain). 

Fluorescent probe nanoparticles were also prepared using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) [24].  

2.2. CHARACTERIZATION OF THE DEVELOPED NANOPARTICLES  

The incorporation of Dex into the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles was investigated by            

1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and 

Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were dissolved in deuterated water, D2O (Aldrich,

differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells and ectopic bone formation

USA). The NMR spectra were obtained with a Mercury -400BB operating at a frequency of 399.9 MHz 

at 50?C. The one-dimensional 1H spectra were acquired using a 45? pulse, a spectral width of 6.3 kHz 

and an acquisition time of 2.001 seconds.  

Zeta potential and particle size of the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and Dex-loaded 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were measured in a particle size analyzer (Zetasizer Nano ZS, 

Malvern Instruments, UK). For the present study, particle size analyses were performed by dynamic 

light scattering (DLS), in an aqueous solution with low concentration of nanoparticles and using 

disposable sizing cuvettes. Electrophoretic determinations of Zeta potential were investigated using the 

universal ‘dip’ cell, at pH 3 and pH 7.4, in a citrate buffer and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solutions, 

respectively. Zeta potential was also investigated in water. 

The changes on the morphology of the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles after incorporation of 

Dex was investigated under transmission electron microscopy, TEM (Philips CM-12, FEI Company, The 

Netherlands) equipped with a MEGA VIEW-II DOCU camera and Image Software Analyzer SIS NT 

DOCU, as previously described elsewhere [24].  

2.3. STARCH-POLYCAPROLACTONE (SPCL) SCAFFOLDS 

A blend of starch and poly-?-caprolactone from Novamont (Italy) 30/70 (w/w) was used to produce fibres 

of starch-polycaprolactone (SPCL) by melt spinning using a modular co-rotating twin screw extruder. 

SPCL scaffolds with 5 mm diameter and 4 mm height were obtained by fibre bonding as reported 

elsewhere [25,26]. More details on SPCL scaffolds can be found elsewhere [27]. Prior in vivo studies all the 

SPCL scaffolds were sterilized under an ethylene oxide gas atmosphere. 

2.4. IN VITRO STUDIES 

2.4.1. Luminescent viability assay 

Rat bone marrow stromal cells (RBMSCs) were isolated from femora of 7 week-old male Fischer 344/N 

rats (SLC Inc. Japan), and expanded in T75 cm2 culture flasks in the presence of Eagle’s minimum 

essential medium (MEM, Nacalai Tesque, Japan) with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS, JRH Biosciences, 

USA) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (A/B, Nacalai Tesque, Japan) solution, the so-called MEM complete 

medium. Firstly, the animals were sacrificed following the protocol approved by Ethics Committee at the 

Tissue Engineering Research Center (Amagasaki, Japan). The femora’s were collected, marrow flushed 

out and marrow cells from each shaft were transferred into a T75 cm2 culture flask (BD Biosciences

Discovery Labware, Bedford, USA) and expanded under standard culturing conditions. The culture 

medium was changed within a 3 days period to remove non-adherent cells, followed by changing the 

culture medium each 2 or 3 days, until reaching about 80% confluence. RBMSCs were trypsinized with 

1 mL of 0.05% tripsin-0.53 mM EDTA (Invitrogen, USA) solution, and incubated for 3 minutes at 37ºC. 

Complete culture medium was added and RBMSCs (passage 1, P1) were centrifuged at 900 rpm for 5 

minutes. Then, supernatant was aspirated and cells re-suspended with 10 mL of complete culture 

medium. Cell counting was performed using an automated counter (Cell Counter Sysmex F-520, 

Japan). Viability of RBMSCs was analyzed with a NucleoCounter (Chemometec, Denmark), prior 

seeding [28]. 

RBMSCs were seeded (sub-cultured) to each well of a 96-well tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) plate 

at a cell density of 5 x 103 cells.mL-1, as previously described elsewhere [24]. Serial dilutions (1, 0.1, and 

0.01 mg.mL-1) of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles were prepared using the MEM complete culture medium, and RBMSCs cultured with the 

respective media for 24 and 72 hours.  A latex rubber extract was used as the positive control for 

cellular death. After each time period, the ATP content was measured by means of performing a 

CellTiter-Glo® luminescent cell viability assay (Promega Corporation, USA). Luminescence was 

measured in a microplate reader (Wallac ARVOsx 1420, Perkin-Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, 

USA). All experiments were carried out in triplicate using 4 replicates per experimental condition. 

2.4.2. Investigation of the internalization efficiency upon incorporation of dexamethasone into the 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles  

RBMSCs were isolated and expanded as described above. Then, RBMSCs were sub-cultured in a 6-

well (1 x 105 cells.well-1) and a tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) coverslips in 24-well TCPS plates (2 x 

104 cells.well-1) for analysis under FACS and fluorescence microscopy, respectively.  

For fluorescence microscopy, RBMSCs were cultured in a MEM complete culture medium 

supplemented with the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and MEM complete 

culture medium with the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles at a concentration of  

0.1 mg.mL-1 for the period of 12 hours until 14 days. By its turn, for FACS analysis RBMSCs were 

cultured in the presence of 0.01 mg.mL-1 FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles 

nanoparticles, for the period of 12 hours until 14 days. All experiments were carried out in triplicate. 

After each time period, the RBMSCs were fixed with 4% formalin (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) and 

incubated with Texas Red?-X phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, USA) and Hoechst 33258

(Invitrogen, USA) for staining the actin filaments of cytoskeleton and nuclei of cells, respectively. We 

followed the protocols provided by the supplier, with few modifications. The specimens were observed 

under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX70, OLYMPUS Co. Ltd., Japan). 

Prior FACS analysis each well of the 6-well plate was washed with PBS and cells released from 

substratum as described above. After centrifugation at 900 rpm for 5 minutes, RBMSCs were re-

suspended in 0.5 mL of complete culture medium and passed through cell strainers [29]. Propidium 

iodide (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) was added to each sample for determining the number of live cells. 

Then, RBMSCs were loaded in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences Imunocytometry 

Systems, USA) and analyzed with a minimum of 10,000 events counting [24].  

2.4.3. Assessment of calcein uptake (mineralization), in vitro 

RBMSCs were isolated from F344/N rats and expanded as described above. RBMSCs (P1) were 

cultured in a TCPS 24-well plate at a cell density of 2 x 104 cells.well-1 and cultured in a complete MEM 

medium for 24 hours. After that time, culture medium was replaced by the different culture media, and 

RBMSCs cultured for times up to 14 days. The effect of the concentration of Dex-loaded 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles on the RBMSCs osteogenic differentiation was investigated as 

previously reported elsewhere [24]. Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were dissolved 

in MEM complete medium supplemented with 0.28 mM ascorbic acid (Wako Pure Chemicals, Japan) 

and 10 mM ?-glycerophosphate (Sigma, USA) at a final concentration of 0.01 and 1 mg.mL-1. RBMSCs 

were also cultured in a MEM complete medium (negative control for osteogenic differentiation), MEM 

complete medium containing 1 mg.mL-1 of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles, and MEM 

complete medium containing 10 mM ?-glycerophosphate (negative controls). MEM complete medium 

supplemented with 10-8 M Dex, 0.28 mM ascorbic acid and 10 mM ?-glycerophosphate was used as the 

positive control for osteogenic differentiation. Culture media were changed every 2-3 days.  

The degree of mineralization was qualitatively and quantitatively investigated following the method 

described by Uchimura et al. [30]. Succinctly, the method consists on the culturing of the RBMSCs in the 

presence of 1 ?g.mL-1 of calcein (Dojindo Laboratories, Japan), which is incorporated in the mineralized 

extracellular matrix and allow us to investigate the calcium deposition.  After each time period (1, 7 and 

14 days), each well was washed twice with PBS after which 1 mL of PBS was added. The fluorescence 

of calcein incorporated into the mineralized matrices was both visualized and quantified in a image 

analyzer equipment (Typhoon 8600 Variable Mode Imager, Amersham Biosciences, USA) using a 526 

nm short pass filter. Afterwards, the fluorescence of the incorporated calcein was also observed under a

fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX70, OLYMPUS Co. Ltd., Japan). All experiments were carried out 

3 times using a minimum of 4 replicates per experimental condition. 

2.5. IN VIVO STUDIES 

RBMSCs were expanded in different culture media namely, MEM, MEM supplemented with Dex and 

MEM supplemented with the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. Then, the respective 

RBMSCs at different cell numbers (1 x 106 and 2 x 105) were seeded onto the surface of the SPCL 

scaffolds, cultured overnight in MEM complete medium for cell adhesion, and then constructs were 

implanted subcutaneously. Seven-week-old male Fisher 344 rat (Syngeneic F344/N rat), same as donor 

sub-strain and age, were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (Nembutal, Dainippon 

Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Japan) at a final concentration of 3.5 mg per 100 g of body weight. The hair of 

the rat was cut at the implantation area, followed by washing with tap water and scrubbed with tincture 

of iodine and 70% ethanol. In each rat, three or four skin incisions (each 1 cm length) on the dorsal 

midline below the ear were made. Each RBMSCs-SPCL constructs was implanted subcutaneously (1.5 

to 2 cm away from the midline at both right and left sides) into the respective pocket and skin sutured. 

As a negative control, we used SPCL implants without RBMSCs. No prophylactic medication was 

administered post-surgery. After 4 weeks implantation, the animals were sacrificed with an overdose of 

anesthetic and RBMSCs-SPCL constructs and controls were retrieved. All experiments were carried out 

3 times. 

2.5.1. Micro-computed tomography (µ-CT) and morphometric analyses 

New bone formation in the explants was evaluated using micro-Computed Tomography (micro-CT). 

Micro-CT was carried out with a high-resolution µ-CT Skyscan 1072 scanner (Skyscan, Kontich, 

Belgium) using a resolution of pixel size of 6.59 ?m and integration time of 1.7 ms. The X-ray source 

was set at 40 keV of energy and 250 ?A of current. Approximately 400 projections were acquired over a 

rotation range of 180° with a rotation step of 0.45°. Data sets were reconstructed using standardized 

cone-beam reconstruction software (NRecon v1.4.3, SkyScan). The output format for each sample was 

500 serial 1024x1024 bitmap images. Representative data set of 250 slices were segmented into binary 

images with a dynamic threshold of 220-255 (grey values) to assess new bone formation. The same 

representative volume of interest (VOI) was analysed for all the samples. These data sets were used for 

morphometric analysis (CT Analyser, v1.5.1.5, SkyScan) and to build the 3-D models (ANT 3-D creator, 

v2.4, SkyScan). The morphometric analysis included scaffold characterization such as porosity and

interconnectivity, histograms and new bone formation quantification. The distribution of this new bone 

formation in the scaffolds was assessed by 3-D virtual models that were created, visualized and 

registered using both image processing software’s (CT Analyser and ANT 3-D creator).  

2.5.2. Histological studies 

After ?-CT analysis, the explants were decalcified with K-CX solution (Falma Co., Tokyo, Japan) for 

histological analysis. Firstly, the explants were dehydrated in an ascending series grade ethanol/water 

solution (from 90-100%) for 19 hours followed by washing three times with xylene. Then, explants were 

immersed in paraffin at 62ºC and allowed to solidify at -5ºC. Slides were prepared by cutting the 

explants into sections 5 ?m thick using a microtome, and mounted in a micro-slide glass (Matsunami 

glass Ind. Ltd., Japan). Paraffin was melt by placing the slides in the oven at 71ºC for 20 minutes and 

allowed to let cool down at room temperature. The remnant paraffin was then subsequently removed 

from slides by immersion in hexane for 5 minutes (S.T. Chemical, Japan), and in a ethylene/propylene 

mixture (Clear Plus, Falma Co., Tokyo, Japan) for 3 minutes. Then, slides were immersed three times in 

100% ethanol for 2 minutes each time of immersion.   

For the Haematoxylin &amp;amp; Eosin (H&amp;amp;E) staining, slides were sequentially transferred to a 90% ethanol and 

then to a 70% and washed with tap water. It followed the staining steps and mounted for observation as 

described elsewhere [31]. 

2.5.3. Analyses of biochemical parameters 

Alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) and osteocalcin content were measured to evaluate osteoblast 

differentiation, in vivo. Prior to the assay, the explants were washed with Ca and Mg-free PBS solution. 

Then, explants were transferred to a 2 mL eppendorf and pulverized with zirconia balls as previously 

reported [25]. Prior to analysis the samples were sonicated and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 1 minute at 

4?C. To each well of a 96-well plate was added an aliquot of supernatant and p-nytrophenyl phosphate 

substrate (ZYMED® Laboratories, Invitrogen, USA) [28]. The plate was then incubated in the dark for 30 

minutes at 37ºC and after that time the reaction was stopped with 1 M NaOH (Panreac). Standards 

were prepared with p-nytrophenol, pNP. Triplicates were made for each sample and standard. 

Absorbance was read at 405 nm (Wallac ARVOsx 1420, Perkin-Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, 

USA), and sample concentrations were read off from the standard graph. Enzyme activity was 

expressed either as nmol of pNP released/explant/30 minutes.

The remnant of each sample used for the ALP assay of the explants, was treated with a 20% formic 

acid solution and stored at 4?C for 2-3 days. Afterwards samples were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 

minutes at 4?C. Then, the supernatant was passed through a SephadexTM G-25 column (GE 

healthcare, Sweden), subsequently concentrated for performing the Enzyme-linked immunosorbent 

assay (ELISA). A Rat Osteocalcin EIA kit (N? BT-460, Biomedical Technologies Inc., MA, USA) was 

used following the instructions provided by the supplier. Data was read off from the standard curve 

obtained with human osteocalcin and expressed as ng of deposited osteocalcin per explant. 

2.5.4. Calcium content  

As an index of mineral bone formation, deposited calcium in the explants was quantified as described by            

Kim et al. [32,33], with minor modifications. Succinctly, explants were rinsed with Ca and Mg-free PBS 

solution and 0.2 mL of 1N HCl per explants was added.  The tissues were chopped before being placed 

on an orbital shaker to extract calcium for 12 hours. Then, mixtures were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 

10 minutes and supernatants were assayed using a commercial calcium assay kit (Calcium C-test™, 

Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Japan) and following the instructions provided by the supplier. 

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

The water soluble nanoparticles could easily be characterized by NMR.  1H NMR spectra (in D2O) of the 

nanoparticles is shown in Figure 1 (albeit broad peaks). The 1H NMR spectrum of CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles (Figure 1A) is relatively complex but showed a singlet at 2.49 ppm, and 

multiplets ? from 3.1 to 3.73 ppm and 4.07 ppm, which were ascribed to the H2 protons, the ring 

methine protons (H3, H4, H5 and H6), and protons of –CH2COO- groups of the CMCht [34,35]. Also, the 

presence of the PAMAM dendrimer is revealed by distinct peaks from 1.98 to 3.46 ppm. These have 

been attributed to CH2COO, CH2CO and CH2CN groups. In addition, new signals were not detected, but 

the peaks at 2.49 and 3.46 ppm appears overlapped as a result of the resonances of the CH2COO and 

CH2 protons of both CMCht and PAMAM. The presence of the peak at ca. 3 ppm and the absence of a 

peak at 4.3 ppm can indicate that the substitutions occurred mainly on the C2 amino group of CMCht. 

The spectrum of the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles (Figure 1B) shows the typical 

signals from CMCht, PAMAM dendrimers and Dex. From spectrum it is possible to observe small 

singlets at 1.14, 1.28 ppm and 1.86 ppm from CH3 and CH2 groups, and a doublet at 7.55 ppm and 7.96 

ppm which are attributed to the chemical shifts of the protons attached to C1 atoms and to aromatic ring

effectively incorporated into the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles.

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles (B), in D2O.  The signal around at ca. 4.61 ppm is ascribed to 

D2O. 

Figure 2 shows the TEM image of the CMCht/PAMAM nanoparticles before and after incorporation of 

Dex. This study clearly demonstrated the consistency in respect to shape of the synthesized 

macromolecules, which exhibit a nanosphere-like shape. Moreover, we can observe that incorporation 

of Dex affect the morphology of the nanoparticles. In fact, it is possible to observe the formation 

dendron-like nanoparticles instead of the nanosphere-like structure. From Figure 2B it is possible to 

observe aggregation of nanoparticles with ~4 nm. A possible explanation for this may be related with the 

self-aggregation behavior of CMCht. 

On the other hand, since particle size is one of the most important parameters in drug carriers for 

intracellular delivery, we thus investigated here mainly the particle size and surface charge by dynamic

light scattering, DLS (Table 1). Moreover, to explore the influence of pH on the particle properties, Zeta 

potential was studied at physiological and lysosomal typical pH´s. 

 

Figure 2. Representative TEM images of the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles (A), and        

Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticle (B). 

The results are resumed in Table 1 and show that upon Dex loading into the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles the hydrodynamic diameter of the particles increase, while no significant variation on the 

zeta potential was observed.  

Zeta potential is a property involving not only the particles but also their environment, e.g. pH, ionic 

strength, and even the type of ions in the suspension [37]. By its turn, it is expected that CMCht has a 

good pH and ion sensitivity in aqueous solution due to abundant –COOH and –NH2 groups. This is 

relatively evident by the observed values of Zeta potential measured in a PBS solution (pH 7.4) and in 

water. On the other hand, since zeta potential of particles is decided by their surface properties [38], this 

data shows that the negatively charged carboxymethyl groups in the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles were mainly distribute at the surface of the nanoparticles, which clearly reveals the 

successful surface engineering of the PAMAM dendrimers.  

Upon incorporation of Dex the absolute value of Zeta potential decrease from 32.8 to 27.3 mV. The 

observed decrease can explain in part, the particle agglomeration observed under the TEM. Moreover, 

the increase the nanoparticle size in water can be related with particle agglomeration. Another possible 

explanation for the aggregation of Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles can be related 

with the increase of hydrophobicity upon incorporation of Dex. The present data is in agreement with 

other report by Yinsong et al. [39] that demonstrated the important role of the surface negatively charged

carboxymethyl groups and hydrophobic interactions of cholesterol moieties on the stability of self-

aggregation behavior of cholesterol-modified O-carboxymethylchitosan conjugates.  

Table 1. Zeta potential as a function of pH, and particle size distribution of unloaded and Dex-loaded 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. Data is shown as mean ± standard deviation (S.D.).  

 

 

 

 

 

 

In an acidic medium, the amino and carboxylic groups of CMCht are protonated. Thus, as expected, the 

Zeta potential of the nanoparticles at pH 3 loosed the strong negative character. This would mean that 

within the lysosomes (pH&lt;&lt;5.5), nanoparticles will gradually lead to neutralization of surface charge, i.e. 

‘‘proton sponge’’ effect. The neutralization of the surface charge will cause coagulation of the particles 

and prevent Dex release within lysosomes. In fact, the charge conversion has been reported to be 

beneficial for lysosomal escape [40], and subsequently release Dex in the cytoplasm, where it can bind 

and activate the glucocorticoid receptor [41]. 

Figure 3 shows the RBMSCs viability when cultured in the presence of different culture medium, for 24 

and 72 hours. Results have shown that the nanoparticles are not cytotoxic over RBMSCs at 

concentrations bellow 1 mg.mL-1. As seen in the present work, no significant differences in the RBMSCs 

viability were observed when culturing in the presence of the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles as compared to that for unloaded nanoparticles.  

As previously stated, particle size can affect internalization. On the other hand, in a report by          

Zhang et al. [42] it was demonstrated that Dex treatment decrease the phagocytosis of Straphylococcus 

aureus bioparticles in normal primary trabecular meshwork cells. 

To investigate if the incorporation of Dex into the nanoparticles affects the internalization by RBMSCs, a 

FITC-probe was linked to the nanoparticles. Fluorescence microscopy images of RBMSCs cultured in 

the presence of FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles once corroborated previous 

internalization studies, i.e. also revealed that the FITC-labeled and Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM

dendrimer nanoparticles were taken up by RBMSCs, after 12 hours (Figure 4). RBMSCs continued to 

internalize the nanoparticles (higher fluorescent signals) when cultured for longer period of time. 

Additionally, RBMSCs were also stained with Texas-red phalloidin for observation of cells cytoskeleton. 

From the observations, no rearrangements and morphological changes were detected in the 

cytoskeleton, which is a good indication of its non cytotoxicity.

nanoparticles for the period of 12 hours until 7 days. The fraction of RBMSCs that internalized the 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles reached a maximum of 95.7% after 7 days of culturing, while 

the peak for RBMSCs cultured with Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles was seen at 

14 days of culturing.

Thus, internalization efficiency is lower in cultures supplemented with Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles as compared to that without Dex. This can be associated to a dual effect that 

includes on one hand the larger size of Dex-loaded nanoparticles and on the other the Dex-induced 

suppression of phagocytotic activity [42]. Moreover, the RBMSCs were stained with propidium iodide to 

assess the fraction of live cells. From Table 2, it is possible to observe that the fraction of live cells 

cultured in the presence of FITC-labeled Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles did not 

significantly differ from that of controls, i.e. RBMSCs cultured with the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles and in MEM medium. This corroborates the luminescent viability assay, 

demonstrating that incorporation of Dex into the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles did not elicit 

any cytotoxic effect over RBMSCs.

The later stage of the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells give rises to cells that are 

able to produce mineralized ECM. The osteogenic ability of Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles was investigated by qualitatively and quantitatively determining the levels of calcein 

uptake. This method was developed by Uchimura et al. [30] that demonstrated the linear correlation 

between the calcium content and amount of fluorescence emitted by calcein. This method allows 

monitoring the calcein fluorescence arising from the mineralization process which denotes the 

osteogenic activity in a culture. Figure 6 shows the photograph of a 24-well TCPS plate obtained from 

the Typhoon image analyzer.

It is possible to observe that mineralization only occur in cultures, whose RBMSCs were supplemented 

with Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and osteogenic medium. Figure 7 shows the 

fluorescence intensity values of RBMSCs cultured in the presence of calcein. These results revealed 

that no significant differences in mineralization were observed for cultures supplemented with            

0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles as compared to that for osteogenic 

medium. This is a good indication that the nanoparticles possess osteogenic ability. On the contrary, 

calcein uptake is decrease in cultures supplemented with Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles at a concentration of 1 mg.mL-1. This data is not surprisingly since it has been reported 

that dosage and regimented supply of Dex is required for proper osteoblast differentiation and 

mineralization [43,44]. These results are supported by phase contrast (left) and respective fluorescence 

microscopy images of RBMSCs after culturing in different culture medium and in the presence of calcein 

for 14 days (Figure 8). From the image, we can observe the typical mineral nodule formation in

Histology, scanning electron and fluorescence microscopy imaging are the current methods used for 

evaluating new bone formation and osteointegration of tissue-engineered constructs [45]. These methods 

provide 2-D information of the samples, but the need for processing the sample prior analysis is a 

disadvantage as can modify its original structure. Moreover, the 3-D qualitative and quantitative analysis 

of the newly formed bone within the tissue-engineered constructs are difficult to obtain by these 

techniques. Micro-computed tomography (µ-CT), a non destructive and time-saving technique based on 

X-ray radiation may provide 3-D data such as the total volume, thickness distribution and remodeling of 

newly formed bone into implants in a small animal model [46,47].

Indication of clustered cells and bone mineral nodules (?) (Scale bar: 100 µm). 

In the present work, in vivo studies were conducted to elucidate the ability of the Dex-loaded 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles towards the production of new bone.  SPCL scaffolds with 

67.4 ± 1.3% porosity (as determined by µ-CT) were used as the 3-D matrix, since it have been shown to 

be adequate for supporting RBMSCs osteogenic differentiation, in vitro [25]. Since these scaffolds exhibit 

lower attenuation coefficient than that for bone or calcium phosphates, i.e. the intensity of the x-ray 

beam is reduced less as it passes through the SPCL material [26], we can envision to obtain images and 

determine the total volume of newly formed bone into implants by using the micro-CT technique. We 

therefore cultured in vitro, RBMSCs in the presence of 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles until reaching confluence, seeded the RBMSCs onto the surface of the SPCL 

scaffolds overnight followed by subcutaneous implantation into the back of F344/N rats, for 4 weeks. 

The effect of cell number on the bone forming ability was also investigated, since previously we 

demonstrated that it influences new bone formation [31]. After 4 weeks of implantation, no signs of 

infection or acute inflammatory reaction were detected at the implantation sites for all implants.

were observed.

The areas of higher attenuation detected can be an indication of de novo bone formation, since the 

SPCL scaffolds and SPCL explants have an attenuation coefficient between 0.3 and 0.6 cm-1, which is 

lower than that for ceramics and mineralized matrix. To elucidate this issue, histological studies were 

carried out. Figure 10 shows the 3-D images of the SPCL scaffolds and explants obtained from µ-CT 

analyses and respective microscopic images of the explants histological sections stained with

explants and SPCL scaffolds seeded with 2 x 105 RBMSCs, no white areas were observed. In fact, 

compact masses were only observed in the explants whose RBMSCs were exposed to Dex and      

Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles during expansion in vitro. From the histological 

photographs of the explants, it is evident that the massive areas of high attenuation (white areas) 

correspond to newly formed bone. By its turn, explants where RBMSCs were not exposed to Dex, 

fibrous tissue formation within the pores of SPCL scaffolds can be observed. Despite, this data shows 

the importance of the porous size and interconnectivity on the cells in-growth since fibrovascular tissue

could be seen in the core of the scaffolds (data not shown). Interestingly, the histological image of the 

explants whose RBMSCs were supplemented with Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles 

shows a superior bone organization as compare to explants whose RBMSCs were supplemented with 

Dex from culture media. Cuboid osteoblasts lining the forming bone matrix in SPCL scaffolds seeded 

with 1 x 106 RBMSCs indicate an active bone formation site (black arrow). Moreover, it is also possible 

to observe the lacunar spaces and reminiscent osteocyte-like cells entrapped in the bone matrix (white 

arrows). Thus, osteocytic lacunae in the lamellar bone are uniform and regularly distributed with 

osteoblasts forming a continuous layer of bone in a unidirectional way typical of mature bone. Moreover, 

we observe that new bone formation occurs primarily at the core of the scaffold, which reveals that the 

scaffolds possess an adequate pore size and interconnectivity. 

Figure 11 shows a representative microscopy photograph of a decalcified section (H&amp;amp;E staining) of 

SPCL explants seeded with 1 x 106 RBMSCs exposed to the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles, after 4 weeks of subcutaneous implantation.

SPCL scaffolds exhibit radiological features that possibly to investigate the new bone formation into the 

implants in a non destructive manner by using the µ-CT technique. 

Complementarily, morphometric analyses corroborated the histological data which reveal that new bone 

formation only occurs in the explants seeded with 1 x 106 RBMSCs and that were exposed to Dex and 

Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM nanoparticles from culture media (Figure 12). Micro-CT analysis reveal that 

in the explants with 1 x 106 RBMSCs cultured in MEM media, bone formation occurs though in low 

amounts. Thus, this data shows that RBMSCs cultured with Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM nanoparticles 

prior implantation might be beneficial in TE strategies for enhancing new bone formation.

Alkaline phosphatase was measured to evaluate the osteoblast differentiation, in vivo (Figure 13, top). 

Results demonstrated that ALP activity is increased in cultures where RBMSCs were exposed to Dex, 

i.e. Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles, and Dex supplemented from culture media. 

This data is not surprisingly, since the previous in vitro release studies [24] of Dex from the 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles showed that Dex concentration resembles to that from 

osteogenic media. Therefore, this data shows that SPCL scaffolds are effective on supporting the 

osteogenic differentiation of RBMSCs and new bone formation, in vivo. Figure 13 (bottom) shows the

Significant differences in the organization of the newly formed bone were observed under the 

histological studies. To elucidate these findings, calcium was extracted from the explants by acid 

treatment to investigate the quality and degree of mineralization of the newly bone formed. Figure 14 

shows the calcium content in the several explants after 4 weeks of subcutaneous implantation. As 

expected no considerable calcium deposition was found in the SPCL scaffold explants and SPCL 

scaffolds seeded with the RBMSCs that were cultured in the absence of Dex.

Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles (F), and explant with 1 x 106 RBMSCs cultured in 

MEM with Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles (G). 

These results corroborates the histological and µ-CT findings, demonstrating that bone formation only 

occurs in the explants seeded with 1 x 106 RBMSCs exposed to Dex and Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles. Moreover, a significant increase in the calcium deposited is observed when 

expanding the RBMSCs with Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles, which denotes the 

superior mineralization of the newly bone formed. We advance with a possible explanation for the 

superior bone organization and mineralization observed in the explants with 1 x 106 RBMSCs 

supplemented with Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles, which can be due to the

supply of Dex for longer time and in a regimented manner, as Dex can be released from the 

nanoparticles inside cells during in vivo implantation time. 

Succinctly, the biochemical data shows that porous SPCL scaffolds alone do not induce bone formation 

upon subcutaneous implantation in the back of the F344/N rats. However, by seeding RBMSCS 

supplemented with Dex onto the scaffolds bone formation could be detected, when cell number was      

1 x 106. Moreover, the use of CMCht/PAMAM nanoparticles for the intracellular delivery of Dex stimulate 

stem cells differentiation towards production of bone mineral in the absence of the typical osteogenic 

supplements, in vivo. 

As revealed by µ-CT analyses, histology and calcium assay, the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles internalization by RBMSCs ex vivo can afford a regimented supply of Dex in vivo, and 

stimulate RBMSCs to produce superior bone mineral. Remarkably, the SPCL scaffolds proved to be 

adequate for fundamental studies as they studies support bone formation in vivo, allowing also the 

analysis of new bone using a nondestructive technique such as micro-computed tomography.  

4. CONCLUSIONS 

Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were successfully developed.  Results obtained 

from 1H NMR, TEM, Zeta potential and particle size analysis revealed that Dex incorporation greatly 

influences the structure and the surface characteristics of the nanoparticles. These were found to 

possess pH and ionic-responsive nature. The in vitro tests showed that the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles at concentrations bellow 1 mg.mL-1 do not exert any significant cytotoxic effect 

over RBMSCs. Furthermore, its ability for being taken up by RBMSCs was shown and incorporation of 

Dex into the nanoparticles showed to decrease their internalization efficiency. Complementarily, it was 

shown that these Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles have the ability to promote in 

vitro mineralization, denoting its osteogenic ability. Moreover, the in vivo studies proved that the Dex-

loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles may find applications in bone tissue engineering and 

regenerative medicine strategies, namely as an intracellular drug delivery nanocarrier able to promote 

the osteogenic differentiation of RBMSCs and inducing superior de novo bone formation. To our 

knowledge the present work demonstrate for the first time, the use of non cytotoxic nanoparticles able to 

program the differentiation pathway from the interior of stem cells, being able, in particular to promote 

superior bone formation in vivo when using stromal cells. This work mark the transition from ‘proof-of-

concept’ to useful intracellular nanocarrier tool as these nanoparticles show promise in clinically relevant 

approaches for bone regeneration.

CHAPTER XI.  

Summary and general conclusions 

1. SUMMARY AND GENERAL CONCLUSIONS 

Nanotechnology and medicine research are merging with other fields leading to completely new science 

and superior technological platforms such as those recently reported for regenerative medicine and 

neurosciences. The main aim of this thesis was to exploit a new concept based on combining 

nanotechnology and traditional tissue engineering strategies towards developing more efficient 

approaches for the treatment of damage/diseased cells and tissues. The use of surface engineered 

dendrimers to deliver bioactive agents from inside the cells is aimed at improve in vivo, the biological 

performance of stem cell alone or combined with scaffolds, the so-called cells-scaffold constructs.   

Dendrimers and their derivatives have been exhibiting unique physicochemical properties which have 

great potential to be used as nanocarriers in a variety of applications, including tissue engineering and 

regenerative medicine, which have been discussed in the first chapter of this thesis. Though, high 

generation dendrimers with amine capping-groups causes haemolysis and changes in red cell 

morphology, since they bind to negatively charged membranes of cells in a non-specific manner and 

can cause toxicity in vitro and in vivo. To circumvent this drawback, we modified the surface of low 

generation poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers with carboxymethylchitosan (CMCht), to reduce the 

cytotoxic effects of cationic and high-generation dendrimers and reduce the haemolytic toxicity by 

reduction/shielding of the positive charge on the dendrimer surface, while enhancing the peripheral 

congestion to improve container properties. Carboxymethylchitosan was chosen due to its water 

solubility, low toxicity and antimicrobial activity making it attractive for applications in the controlled 

release of drugs. Thus, carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer (CMCht/PAMAM) 

nanoparticles were prepared in a stepwise manner as follows: (i) increasing the generation of the 

PAMAM-carboxylic terminated (G 1.5), (ii) obtaining a PAMAM-methyl ester terminated dendrimer, (iii) 

reaction of PAMAM and CMCht, i.e. the reaction goes through a condensation reaction between the 

methyl ester and amine groups, and (iv) modifying the methyl ester groups that do not react to 

carboxylic ones in the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer, followed by precipitation. As a model drug, 

dexamethasone (Dex) was incorporated into CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles due to its 

important role in osteogenesis and clinical relevance.  

 



CHAPTER XI. Summary and general conclusions 

 
 
- 372 - 
 

To assess the potential of using the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles systems for 

application in tissue engineering, we used different biomaterials to develop a set of novel scaffolds (3-D 

systems) suitable for applications in bone, cartilage and osteochondral tissue engineering.  

Chitosan was used a biomaterial for developing support for cartilage due to its easy processability and 

biological properties such as biocompatibility and immunological, antibacterial and wound-healing 

activity. Moreover, chitosan shares structural characteristics with various glucosaminoglycans (GAGs) 

and given its importance in stimulating the chondrogenesis, the use of GAG analogs as components of 

a cartilage tissue engineered scaffold is desired for improving chondrogenesis.  

Hydroxylapatite was used a a biomaterial to develop scaffolds for bone applications since its 

structure resembles to the primary mineral component of bone. Other advantages include the good 

processability, non-cytotoxicity, non-immunogenicity, resorbability and osteoconductivity.  

Starch-based biomaterials such as the starch-polycaprolactone (SPCL) were also used within the scope 

of this thesis mainly due to the advantages of being non-cytotoxicity, biodegradable, present good 

mechanical properties and can be processed by different methodologies. Processability is an important 

feature which can allow us to tailor the final properties of the scaffolds, and can be a major advantage in 

comparative studies. Moreover, it can be possible to investigate qualitatively and quantitatively the 

calcified tissue within the explants using a non-destructive and time-saving technique such as micro-

computed tomography, as polymeric materials exhibit lower attenuation coefficient as compared to bone 

or ceramics.  

The general conclusions of the research work produced in the present thesis, which extends from 

Chapter III to X, are summarized as follows.

INNOVATIVE “AUTOCATALYTIC” ELECTROLESS CO-PRECIPITATION ROUTE 

Chapter III describes the “autocatalytic” electroless deposition route for production of a composite 

scaffolds composed of hydroxylapatite (HAp) and carboxymethylchitosan (CMCht) for bone tissue-

engineering scaffolding applications. This work demonstrated that it is possible to prepare such 

composite scaffolds by means of combining a novel acidic “autocatalytic” co-precipitation route and a 

novel wax spheres leaching methodology. The physicochemical properties of the composite scaffolds 

may be tailored, especially the 3-D architecture, content in organic-inorganic phases, and dissolution 

behaviour. Therefore, these composite scaffolds are very promising whenever degradability and 

bioactivity are simultaneously desired, such as in the case of bone tissue-engineering scaffolding

applications. Moreover, these novel composite scaffolds can possibly support the incorporation of      

pH-sensitive proteins up to physiological pH, which is known to be one major drawback of chitosan 

materials for such type of applications. Despite, the promissing data, no cell culture studies were carried 

out in order to fully exploit its potential usefulness in tissue engineering applications. 

1.2. MACROPOROUS HYDROXYLAPATITE SCAFFOLDS FOR BONE TISSUE ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS: 

PHYSICOCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION AND ASSESSMENT OF RAT BONE MARROW STROMAL CELL VIABILITY  

Chapter IV reports a new methodology for developing HAp scaffolds by using an organic sacrifice 

template, and its potential to find applications in bone tissue engineering scaffolding investigated. The 

novelty of this work consists on the possibility of obtaining porous and highly interconnected scaffolds 

mimicking the sacrificial component. In fact, this work demonstrated that it is possible to prepare 

sintered hydroxylapatite scaffolds with high interconnectivity by impregnating the template of ‘open-cell’ 

polyurethane (PU) sponge into the HAp slurry, followed by sponge burn-out. The preparation route was 

optimized for producing macroporous HAp structures with controlled morphology, easily mediated by the 

architecture of the PU sponge. In vitro tests have demonstrated that such constructs are bioactive, as 

observed by the formation of an apatite layer after 1 day of immersion in SBF solution. The 

biocompatible behaviour of the macroporous HAp scaffold was demonstrated as evidenced by the non-

cytotoxic effect over L929 cells. Moreover, the cell/material interaction tests have shown that the 

RBMSCs adhered, proliferated well and remained viable on the macroporous hydroxylapatite scaffolds. 

More importantly, the cells were able to populate the inner of the macroporous HAp scaffolds. 

Therefore, the physicochemical and biological properties of the macroporous HAp scaffolds have shown 

to be suitable for bone tissue-engineering applications. 

1.3. NOVEL HYDROXYLAPATITE/CHITOSAN BILAYERED SCAFFOLD FOR OSTEOCHONDRAL TISSUE ENGINEERING 

APPLICATIONS 

Chapter V demonstrates the feasibility to prepare hydroxylapatite/chitosan bilayered scaffolds by means 

of an innovative method that combines a sintering and a freeze-drying technique. The novel 

macroporous hydroxylapatite/chitosan bilayered scaffolds exhibit physicochemical properties that 

appear to make them a suitable candidate to be used as a supportive structure for cells functions. 

Moreover, the in vitro cell culture studies demonstrated that both HAp and CHT layers provide an 

adequate 3-D support for the attachment, proliferation and differentiation of goat bone marrow stromal 

cells (GBMSCs) into osteoblasts and chondrocytes, respectively. The HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds are 



CHAPTER XI. Summary and general conclusions 

 
 
- 374 - 
 

advantageous by several reasons, namely they can be designed with several sizes and controlled 

architecture to fit patient specific injuries and cell functions, respectively. The HAp/CHT bilayered 

scaffolds showed promising biological behavior and may therefore find applications in tissue 

engineering of bone and osteochondral defects. 

1.4. IN VITRO INVESTIGATION OF DEX-LOADED AND CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES: 

INTERNALIZATION EFFICIENCY AND MECHANISM, AND OSTEOGENIC POTENTIAL (2-D SYSTEM) 

In this thesis we demonstrated that the combination of synthetic and natural-based polymers 

enable to prepare CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles of suitable diameters to cover a wide 

range of intracellular delivery applications (Chapter VI and VII). In vitro tests showed that the 

carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles do not exert any significant 

cytotoxic effect over both L929 fibroblast, post-natal neurons and glial cells and RBMSCs for 

concentrations below 1 mg.mL-1. Furthermore, the successful internalization of the nanoparticles 

by two different types of cells, i.e. cell lines and primary cultures, was also demonstrated. We also 

proved that the mechanism by which these nanoparticles are taken up by cells is not exclusively 

endocytotic. The biochemical data presented herein also proved that the Dex-loaded 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles induced the osteogenic differentiation of RBMSCs in 

vitro, in TCPS 2-D substrates. Therefore, the novel CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles may 

be used as targeted-drug delivery carriers covering a wide range of applications involving the 

efficient intracellular delivery of biological agents to modulate the behaviour of cells. These might 

include the use of differentiation factors to act from the inside the cell or genetic material. The 

incorporation of fluorescent labels for live-cell imaging and monitoring of the final intracellular fate 

of such structures is also possible.  

 

1.5. IN VITRO ASSESSMENT OF OSTEOGENIC DIFFERENTIATION WHEN COMBINING DEX-LOADED CMCHT/PAMAM 

DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES, STEM CELLS AND, EITHER HAP AND SPCL SCAFFOLDS (3-D SYSTEM) 

In this thesis, it was our aim to fully investigate the biological performance of the macroporous HAp and 

SPCL scaffolds when seeded with RBMSCs exposed to Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer 

nanoparticles. These two types of scaffolds were chosen for their similar architecture, i.e. porosity, 

interconnectivity and pore size, while possessing different composition. Both were found to be adequate 

for culturing RBMSCs, namely for adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation, in vitro (Chapter 

VIII). Despite, RBMSCs proliferation and osteogenic differentiation are favoured when cultured onto the 



CHAPTER XI. Summary and general conclusions 

 
 

- 375 - 
 

surface of the HAp scaffolds, but the results obtained for SPCL are quite similar and much better than 

one could expect for a biodegradable polymer. On the other hand, the biochemical data demonstrated 

that the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles enhanced the early osteogenic 

differentiation of RBMSCs in a 3-D environment, in vitro.  

1.6. IN VIVO PROOF-OF-CONCEPT 

Chapter IX exploited the potential of the combinatorial strategy in tissue engineering principles 

employing CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles towards the intracellular release and regimented 

supply of dexamethasone (Dex) aimed at control stem cells osteogenic differentiation in the absence of 

typical osteogenic inducers, in vivo. In this work, we have demonstrated that cell number and ex vivo 

culturing strategies greatly influences the osteogenesis and de novo bone formation, in vivo. RBMSCs 

expanded with 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and seeded at low 

cell number on the surface of the HAp scaffolds enhanced the ectopic bone formation, after 4 weeks of 

subcutaneous implantation in the back of F344/N rats. This study revealed that the novel Dex-loaded 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles may be beneficial as intracellular nanocarrier and supply of 

Dex in a regimented manner to modulate and direct stem cells differentiation towards osteogenic 

phenotype, enhance proteoglycan extracellular matrix synthesis and superior ectopic de novo bone 

formation. The architecture of HAp scaffolds proved to be a good support for osteogenic differentiation 

of bone marrow derived osteoblast and new bone formation, in vivo. Thus, the tissue engineering 

strategy proposed in this thesis showed to be effective on promoting de novo bone formation in vivo and 

avoid the long time of in vitro culturing in the presence of osteogenic cocktails which is seen as major 

drawback for most clinical applications.  

Complementarily, Chapter X report deeper studies on the chemistry of the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM 

dendrimer nanoparticles and also the in vivo osteogenic ability. These nanoparticles were found to 

possess pH and ionic-responsive nature. Moreover, we have observed that Dex incorporation greatly 

influences the structure of the nanoparticles. The in vitro tests showed that the Dex-loaded 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles at concentrations bellow 1 mg.mL-1 do not exert any significant 

cytotoxic effect over RBMSCs. Furthermore, its ability for being taken up by RBMSCs was shown and 

incorporation of Dex into the nanoparticles decreases their internalization efficiency. It was shown that 

these Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles have the ability to promote in vitro 

mineralization, denoting its osteogenic ability. In vivo, the biochemical data revealed that porous SPCL 

scaffolds alone do not induce bone formation upon subcutaneous implantation in the back of the F344/N

rats. However, by seeding RBMSCs supplemented with Dex onto the scaffolds bone formation could be 

detected, when cell number was 1 x 106 cells.  Moreover, these studies proved that the Dex-loaded 

CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles internalization by RBMSCs ex vivo, can afford a regimented 

supply of Dex in vivo, and stimulate RBMSCs to produce superior bone mineral. Remarkably, the SPCL 

scaffolds proved to be adequate for fundamental studies as it revealed by in vivo studies supported 

bone formation, while allow qualitative and quantitative analyses of the newly bone formed using a non-

destructive technique such as the micro-computed tomography. 

As a final remark, this thesis mark the transition from ‘proof-of-concept’ to useful intracellular nanocarrier 

tool, as the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles show promise for applications in 

several cells and tissues therapies. The use of these nanocarriers towards the incorporation of multiple 

bioactive agents and formulations aimed at find applications in osteochondral tissue engineering or for 

targeting central nervous system can also be envisioned.
