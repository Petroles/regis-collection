Abstract: Aim: The aim of the present study was to examine the benthic fauna in a 
marginal pond lateral to the Paranapanema River and to identify the main controlling 
factors of its distribution. Considering the small size of the lacustrine ecosystem, we 
expected that seasonal variations of the benthic community attributes are more important 
than spatial variations; Methods: Two samplings, one in March and another in August, 
were carried out at nine sites in the pond. Sediment samples were obtained through a Van 
Veen grab for invertebrate sorting, granulometric analysis, and for quantification of organic 
matter in sediment. Other abiotic factors were measured, such as water transparency, 
dissolved oxygen, pH, electric conductivity, temperature, and depth of sediment sampling 
sites. Regarding the comparative analysis at spatial scale, no significant variations in 
density of the benthic invertebrate community were found. Results: In relation to the 
studied abiotic factors, only depth presented significant differences among sampling 
sites; All the measured environmental parameters presented significant differences 
among sampling months, except depth and the physical and chemical characteristics 
of the sediment. The abundance of Chaoboridae and Chironomidae was the unique 
attribute with a significant difference in comparing the two months. A higher abundance 
of taxa occurred in August, especially for Oligochaeta, Nematoda, Chaoboridae, and 
Chironomidae; Conclusions: Because of the low structural complexity of the studied 
pond, we concluded that the changes in benthic macroinvertebrate community attributes 
were mainly due to seasonal effects.

Keywords: benthic fauna, environmental variables, marginal pond, spatial variation, 
temporal variation.

Resumo: Objetivo: O presente estudo tem por objetivo examinar a fauna bentônica 
em lagoa marginal ao rio Paranapanema e os principais fatores reguladores da sua 
distribuição. Devido ao pequeno tamanho do ambiente lacustre, procurou-se mostrar 
que as variações sazonais dos atributos da comunidade bentônica são mais importantes 
do que as variações espaciais; Métodos: Duas coletas, uma em março e outra em agosto 
foram realizadas, em nove locais na lagoa. Amostras de sedimento foram obtidas com um 
pegador de Van Veen, para análise dos invertebrados, da granulometria e da quantidade 
de matéria orgânica do sedimento. Outros fatores abióticos foram medidos, como a 
transparência, o oxigênio dissolvido, o pH, a condutividade elétrica, a temperatura da 
água e a profundidade do local de amostragem do sedimento; Resultados: Na análise 
comparativa no nível de escala espacial, não houve variações significativas na densidade 
da comunidade de invertebrados bentônicos. Com relação aos fatores abióticos estudados, 
apenas a profundidade apresentou diferença significativa entre os pontos de amostragem. 
Todos os parâmetros ambientais mensurados, exceto a profundidade e as características 
físico-químicas do sedimento, apresentaram diferença significativa entre os meses de 
estudo. A abundância dos táxons Chaoboridae e Chironomidae foi o único atributo a 
apresentar diferença significativa entre os meses. Chaoboridae foi dominante em março e 
Chironomidae mais abundante em agosto. Maior abundância de táxons ocorreu em agosto, 
com destaque para os grupos Oligochaeta, Nematoda, Chaoboridae e Chironomidae; 
Conclusões: Em função da baixa complexidade estrutural da lagoa estudada, concluiu-se 
que a comunidade de macroinvertebrados bentônicos é alterada mais expressivamente em 
razão da sazonalidade, sofrendo menos influência de modificações espaciais.

Palavras-chave: fauna bentônica, variáveis ambientais, lagoa marginal, variação

temporal variation, as compared with the organisms 
in environments with high structural complexity, 
which can persist in these sites for a longer time. 
According to Formigo (1997), composition and 
density of macroinvertebrate communities are 
relatively stable from one year to the next in non-
perturbed systems. However, seasonal fluctuations 
linked to the dynamics of vital cycles of each species 
can result in extreme variations in community 
structure in some environments.

In lakes marginal to tropical rivers, as those 
located in flood plains, aquatic biota is mainly 
influenced by the regime of flood pulses, as it was 
observed in the High Paraná River (Higuti and 
Takeda, 2002) and in the High Paranapanema River 
(Davanso and Henry, 2006).

examine composition and diversity of benthic 
macroinvertebrates in different sites of a pond which 
is marginal to a  river. Relationships between the 
different taxa of benthic macroinvertebrates and 
environmental factors were determined. Because 
it is a pond with small size, we expected seasonal 
variations in benthic community to be more 
important than spatial ones, due to the structural 
homogeneity of the environment. 

2. Material and Methods

The environment selected for the study (Mian 
Pond, Figure 1) is located near the mouth zone of 
the Paranapanema into the Jurumirim Reservoir 
(São Paulo, Brazil). It is a small pond (perimeter: 
1,592  m; mean depth: 3.7  m; length: 749  m; 
maximum width: 115 m). The Mian pond presents 
permanent connectivity to the river and one of the 
margins is formed by a riparian forest while the 
other is a non-preserved area next to a soybean field, 
being partially protected from the wind. Nine sites 
distributed in three transects were selected for the 
samplings (Figure 1).

In each site, three sediment samples were 
collected in March and August 2009 with a 
0.064 m2  Van Veen grab for the analysis of benthic 
fauna and an additional three samples for the 
determination of granulometric composition and 
quantification of organic matter in sediment. Depth 
profiles of the lake bottom at sampling site transects 
are shown in Figure 2.

In the field, sampled sediment for benthic fauna 
analysis was washed in 250 µm mesh net and fixed 
with 4% formaldehyde. Afterwards, the organisms 
were sorted, identified, and counted under a 
stereoscopic microscope. They were identified up 

1. Introduction

Comparative studies of small water bodies 
have been used to examine the relationships 
between environmental factors and the structure 
of aquatic communities (Heino, 2000). Benthic 
macroinvertebrates present great importance in 
some ecological processes, such as energy fluxes 
and nutrient cycling (Leal et al., 2003; Henry and 
Santos, 2008). Bioturbation of sediment surface and 
fragmentation of leaves from riparian vegetation are 
some of the processes of nutrient release to water 
carried out by benthic organisms (Caliman et al., 
2007; Callisto et al., 2009).

Considering the benthic macroinvertebrates, 
insects are the predominant taxonomic group 
in abundance and biomass in the majority of 
tropical lakes (França and Callisto, 2007). In all 
these environments, a predominance of Diptera, 
Chironomidae (Stenert et al., 2004; Roque et al., 
2004), and Chaoboridae (Fukuhara  et  al., 1987) 
has been recorded.

According to Jonasson (1996), the distribution, 
composition, and diversity of macroinvertebrates, 
as well as of other aquatic communities, are affected 
by abiotic and biotic factors and also by mutual 
interactions among the organisms. Thus, benthic 
macroinvertebrate communities clearly indicate 
the ecological conditions of inhabited aquatic 
ecosystems. According to Kownacki et al. (2000), 
benthic fauna composition in aquatic environments 
depends mainly on factors such as substratum type, 
water trophic status, and hydro-period.

Oxygen and depth also constitute essential 
factors to macroinvertebrate distribution (Santos 
and Henry, 2001). Density of these organisms is 
remarkably lower at great depths, but the existence of 
some species tolerant to low oxygen concentrations 
is evidenced at these sites (Hirabayashi and Hayashi, 
1994). Other important factors for benthic species 
distribution are the availability of food resources 
(Sanseverino  et  al., 1998) and the interspecific 
trophic interactions, such as competition and 
predation (Walker, 1998).

Ha b i t a t  c o m p l e x i t y  c a n  d e t e r m i n e  t h e 
composition of a local community. According to 
Barreto (1999), diversity of biological communities 
in more complex sites tends to increase due to 
the presence of environments with minor stress, 
ample availability of shelter against predators, and 
protection against physical disturbances, which 
serve to assist in survival, recovery, and persistence 
of the organisms. Therefore communities in 
habitats with low complexity usually present great

1969), electrical conductivity (through a Hach 
Mod. 2511 conductivimeter) and pH (through a 
Micronal Mod. 322 pHmeter). All of them, except 
the transparency, were measured at the surface and 
10  cm of the bottom. Sediment granulometric 
composition was determined according to the 
Wentworth scale (Suguio, 1973) and organic matter 
content, through calcination loss (in a furnace at 
550 °C for 1 hour).

After observation of parametric distribution, 
descriptive statistics (mean) were computed for 

to the lowest taxonomic level using specialized 
literature (Trivinho-Strixino and Strixino 1995; 
Merrit and Cummins, 1996; Brinkhurst and 
Marchese, 1992; Mugnai  et  al., 2010). Density 
(individuals.m-2) and relative abundance of benthic 
macroinvertebrates were computed.

The following water physical and chemical 
variables were determined: temperature (by mercury 
thermometer), transparency (by Secchi disk), 
dissolved oxygen (through the Winkler method, 
modified by azyde addition, Golterman and Clymo,

and sediment organic matter and granulometric 
composition).

All the statistical analyses were carried out using 
the Statistica 6.0 software (Statsoft, 2002).

3. Results

A small variation in rainfall (&lt;3  mm) was 
observed, between the two sampling months 
(Figure  3). Considering that in July there was a 
high level of rainfall, atypical for the dry season, 
no significant difference in depth was found in 
comparing the two studied periods (Figure 4). 

In almost all the sites, silt/clay was dominant in 
the sediment, followed by very fine and fine sands

benthic groups (Chaoboridae, Chironomidae, 
Nematoda and Oligochaeta) that presented great 
total abundance of organisms (&gt;4%). Next, data 
were log (x + 1) transformed and submitted to a two 
way variance analysis (ANOVA) involving sampling 
sites (n  =  9) and periods (n  =  2). Normality and 
variance homogeneity were obtained. A 0.1 level 
was used for testing the significance of ANOVA.

Pearson correlations were computed to assess 
significant relationships (p  &gt;  0.03) between 
abundance of benthic taxa and environmental 
data (water temperature, depth, transparency, 
pH, dissolved oxygen and electrical conductivity,

by site 5 (19.76%) in August, and the lowest value 
(1.99%) was found at site 9 in August.

The variation in density of taxonomic groups is 
shown in Figure 7. Groups with the highest density 
were Chaoboridae, Oligochaeta, Nematoda, and 
Chironomidae. Chaoboridae (exclusively composed 
of Chaoborus  sp.) was the predominant group 
(relative abundance corresponding to 44% of total 
abundance) in relation to the other organisms. 
Chaoboridae constituted more than 50% of the 
organisms in four sites (sites 1 and 6, in both 
months and sites 3 and 7, only in March) and was 
absent only at site 9 in August. The maximum 
density (344 individuals.m–2) was observed at site 
4 in March. Oligochaeta predominated in three 
sites (site 2 in March and sites 8 and 9 in August). 
The highest densities were recorded in August 
(maximum of 240 individuals.m–2) and rose to 
around 21% of all the organisms in the entire study. 
Nematoda occurred in almost all the sampled sites 
and presented the highest relative abundance (50% 
of the total density of organisms) at site 9 in March. 
The highest density (286 individuals.m–2) occurred 
at site 2 in August. Considering both months, 
Nematoda density corresponded to approximately 
17% of the organisms.

Chironomidae was a group with low abundance 
(?2%) in the first month of the study and appeared 
only in two sampling sites. However, in August, 
Chironomidae specimens were observed in almost 
all the sites (except in site 9) and the highest density 
(260 individuals.m–2) was recorded in site 3.

Only depth presented a significant difference 
among sampling sites (F  =  3.30; p  =  0.04).

(highest values in August), water pH at surface

in March) (Figure 8). Regarding the abundance of 
benthic macroinvertebrates, significant differences 
were recorded for Chaoboridae (highest value 
in March) and Chironomidae (highest value in 
August).

Significant Pearson correlations between 
biological and environmental variables are presented 
in Table  1. Chaoboridae density showed positive 
correlation with water temperature and silt/clay (the 
finest fraction of sediment) and negative correlation 
with larger particles in sediment (very coarse, 

(Figure 5). Higher values of silt/clay were observed 
in March. In site 4, sediment was composed of 
different fractions at the same levels as in March 
and August (Figure  5). In site 9, it was observed 
the greatest change in sediment composition 
from March to August. No variation pattern, 
regarding organic matter content in the sediment, 
was evidenced between sites when comparing the 
sampling months (Figure  6). The highest value 
(21.46%) was recorded in March at site 3, followed

were not detected on a spatial scale, since depth 
was the only factor, considering all chemical and 
physical variables, with significant difference among 
sampling sites. Nevertheless, it was not likely to 
cause significant differences in ecological attributes 
of the community in these local. These observations 
evidenced great influence of seasonality on 
organization of the macroinvertebrate community.

In relation to benthic macroinvertebrates 
recorded in lakes of the same study region (Davanso 
and Henry, 2006, 2007), Mian Pond was the only 
that didn’t show significance difference in spatial 
distribution of the fauna. This finding can be 
explained by the reduced size, simple shape (no 
dendritic), and its relatively homogeneous sediment 
composition, morphological characteristics which 
offer low habitat complexity for the colonization 
and permanence of new species. Therefore, the 
simple structure of the pond must be considered 
an important factor in the homogeneity of spatial 
composition registered in the water body, resulting 
in few local alterations in abiotic factors and, 
consequently, in benthic community.

associated negatively with water temperature and 
transparency and positively with water electrical 
conductivity, pH (of both the depths), and dissolved 
oxygen at bottom. 

4. Discussion

In this study, low rainfall variation was observed 
in the two sampling months, selected to be 
representative of the rainy and dry seasons. This 
observation can characterize an “atypical” year, 
considering that the precipitation in August was 
different from the previous occurrence in the region 
(Martins and Henry, 2004; Henry, 2003, 2005; 
Davanso and Henry, 2006, 2007). This certainly 
affected the environmental variables of the aquatic 
ecosystem, except water temperature. 

Despite effects of precipitation regime on 
benthic fauna were slightly detectable, significant 
seasonal alterations in community structure were 
observed, mainly due to variation in temperature, 
dissolved oxygen and sediment composition 
between the seasons. Alterations in benthic fauna

In addition to the morphometric characteristics 
of the pond, another aspect that contributed 
to the high homogeneity of the environment, 
especially in sediment composition, is the absence 

of macrophytes. According to Corbi and Trivinho-
Strixino, (2002), and Beckett  et  al. (1992), the 
highest densities of benthic macroinvertebrates 
are recorded in environments rich in macrophytes.

maintenance of Chaoboridae and Chironomidae 
during the entire year. However, in our study, 
Chironomidae showed a significant negative 
correlation with water temperature, similarly to 
that observed by Davanso and Henry (2006) in 
a pond near the Mian Pond. On the other hand, 
a significant association between Chaoboridae 
organisms and high temperature was recorded 
in the present study, a condition also verified by 
Cleto-Filho and Arcifa (2006) who found highest 
densities of Chaoborus in hot periods, in the Monte 
Alegre Lake.

According to Roque  et  al. (2004) and 
Brito  Junior  et  al. (2005), Chironomidae larvae 
are the most representative and abundant group 
of the benthic macroinvertebrates due to their 
high capacity to adapt to different environmental 
conditions which many other groups cannot. 
Therefore, anoxic conditions in March may have 
caused the absence of these organisms, since 
Chironomidae densities present significant positive 
correlation with bottom oxygen concentrations. 
With the increase in oxygen concentration in 
August, these aquatic insects were recorded.

Low pH values in March, significantly different 
from those observed in August, were probably 
related to the intense degradation of organic matter, 
since low water acidity is derived from ions released 
during decomposition. This fact seems to cause 
some disadvantaged to some taxa in the month of 
March, such as Chironomidae, that showed positive 
correlation with water pH. 

Transparency was a secondary factor responsible 
for seasonal variation in density of these two benthic 
groups as it depends on the rain intensity. The 
rainfall peak in July, one month before sampling, 
was the factor responsible for re-suspension of fine 
material from the bottom to the water column 
through the continuous mixing of water. Thus, 
significantly higher water transparency in March, 
when compared to August, seems to have negatively 
affected the fauna. Again, Chironomidae was most 
affected, which was negatively correlated to the 
variable. Leech and Johnsen (2009) concluded 
that changes in transparency of freshwaters may 
cause alteration in species depth distribution and 
affect predator-prey behavior, then, increases in 
transparency may benefits visual predators. Possibly 
in this study, high transparency facilitates the 
visualization of Chironomidae by predators, such 
as fishes. 

Regarding the granulometric composition of 
pond sediment, silt/clay was dominant in almost 

Macrophytes can increase the structural complexity 
of the environment, as the patches produces high 
amount of organic matter in sediment that lies just 
below them and in their surrounding area. Through 
this, some spatial differences may be produced in 
benthic composition since the patches are unequally 
distributed along the ponds.

Low values of dissolved oxygen in the pond 
bottom were found in both sampling months, 
especially in March (in all the sampling sites 
&lt;3  mg.L–1). According to Hepp (2002), values 
&lt;4  mg.L–1 are enough to cause the mortality 
of many invertebrates not adapted to hypoxic 
conditions near sediment. The variation in pond 
depth appears not to directly influence the observed 
alterations in oxygen concentration, since the Mian 
Pond is a shallow environment. Differences in 
oxygen among sites were insignificant and appear 
to be unimportant for spatial distribution of the 
organisms. Oxygen concentrations at the bottom 
were lower in the first month sampled. This fact can 
be explained by the high amount of allochthonous 
matter introduced in the pond due to the high level 
of water flux and discharge of the Paranapanema 
River in January and February 2009. Organic 
matter deposition at the pond bottom increased 
biological processes, especially decomposition, 
producing high oxygen consumption. Then oxygen 
was probably the determining factor for the lower 
values of benthic fauna density in March (except 
for Choboridae). 

Chaoboridae, Oligochaeta, Nematoda and 
Chironomidae were predominant in benthic fauna. 
According to Pamplin et al. (2006) and Higuti and 
Takeda (2002), the Diptera order, including the 
Chaoboridae and Chironomidae families, and the 
Oligochaeta class, represent the most noticeable and 
relevant organisms of macroinvertebrate benthic 
assemblies.

Considering the two sampling periods, there 
were significant alterations in the densities of 
both groups, with the Chaoboridae being the 
most significant in total abundance in March and 
Chironomidae in August. These modifications in 
densities can be due to significant environmental 
variations among the months of the study, especially 
in the water temperature. This observation is 
evidence of the powerful influence of seasonality 
on the distribution of these organisms.

Strixino and Trivinho-Strixino (1980) observed 
that aquatic ecosystems presenting low mean depths 
(approximately 3  m) are able to maintain a high 
water temperature, thus enabling a proliferation and

that enhanced the great Chaoboridae development 
in Mian Pond, especially in March when fine 
fractions was higher, as densities presented positive 
correlations with silt and negative correlations with 
coarse sand fractions.

Considering the associations between benthic 
macroinvertebrate distribution in the aquatic 
environment and abiotic factors described 
previously, we concluded that reduced spatial 
variation of benthos occurred in the Mian Pond.

variations were observed between rainy and dry 
seasons due to “atypical” rainfall in July, the 
seasonality effects on benthic fauna were more 
expressive than spatial ones, mainly because of 
this community response to some environmental 
factors, like water temperature, dissolved oxygen at 
deep zones, and characteristics of bottom sediment. 
Even though there was a wide variation in depth 
among the sampled sites, it was not able to change 
the structure of benthic community, reinforcing 
the idea that in environments with low structural 
complexity, physical and chemical factors of water 
and sediment are more homogeneous, having 
smaller effect on fauna.
