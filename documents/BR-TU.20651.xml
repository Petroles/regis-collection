ABSTRACT 

Tree growth is highly dependent on the absorptive function of fine roots for water and 
nutrients. Fine roots also play a major role in the global carbon (C) cycle, mainly 
through production, respiration, exudation and decomposition processes. Improving 
our understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of fine roots and greenhouse gases 
in deep soil layers is a key component to identify more sustainable silvicultural 
practices for planted forests in a context of climate change and to improve the current 
biogeochemical models.  

Our study aimed to assess the effect of clear-cutting and drought on fine-root 
production, soil CO2, CH4 and N2O effluxes and production throughout deep soil 
profiles down to the water table in Brazilian coppice-managed Eucalyptus plantations. 
Fine roots (i.e. diameter &amp;lt;2 mm) were sampled down to a depth of 17 m in a throughfall 
exclusion experiment comparing stands with 37% of throughfall excluded by plastic 
sheets (-W) and stands without rain exclusion (+W). Root dynamics were studied using 
minirhizotron in two permanent pits down to a depth of 17 m in treatments -W and +W, 
over 1 year before clear-cutting, then over 2 years in coppice, as well as down to a 
depth of 4 m in a non-harvested plot (NH) serving as a control. CO2, CH4 and N2O 
surface effluxes were measured over three years using the closed-chamber method in 
treatments -W, +W and NH. CO2, CH4 and N2O concentrations in the soil were 
measured from the pits down to a depth of 15.5 m in treatments -W, +W and NH over 
3 months before the clear-cut and 1.5 years after in coppice. 

After harvesting, spectacular fine root growth of trees conducted in coppice occurred 
in very deep soil layers (&gt; 13 m) and, surprisingly, root mortality remained extremely 
low whatever the depth and the treatment. Total fine-root biomass in coppice down to 
a depth of 17 m was 1266 and 1017 g m-2 in treatments +W and -W, respectively, at 
1.5 years after the clear-cut and was 1078 g m-2 in NH 7.5 years after planting. Specific 
root length and specific root area were about 15% higher in -W than in +W. CO2, CH4, 
and N2O effluxes were not significantly different between treatments -W and +W and 
did not change after clear-cutting in the coppice-managed stands compared to non-
harvested stand. CO2 and CH4 concentrations greatly increased with depth and N2O 
concentrations remained roughly constant from the soil surface down to a depth of 
15.5 m. Mean CO2 and N2O concentrations in -W were 20.7% and 7.6% lower than in 
+W, respectively, and CH4 concentrations in -W were 44.4% higher than in +W 
throughout the soil profiles. A diffusivity model showed that CO2, N2O and CH4 
production and consumption occurred at great depths and were similar in treatments 
+W, -W and NH. Clear-cutting did not increase CO2, CH4 and N2O effluxes and 
productions, whatever the water supply regime. 

Establishing deep root systems in tropical planted forests could help trees withstand 
the long drought periods expected under climate change in many tropical regions. Our 
study suggested that coppice management might be an interesting option in tropical 
Eucalyptus plantations, both to improve tree tolerance to drought and store carbon at 
great depth in the soil. Consequences of climate changes on greenhouse gas 
emissions could be minor when tropical Eucalyptus plantations are coppice managed.  

Keywords: Brazil. Eucalyptus grandis. deep root growth. greenhouse gases. 
throughfall exclusion. very deep tropical soil. Coppice. 

  



 
 

 
 

  



 
 

        
 

RESUMO 

Melhorar nossa compreensão sobre a dinâmica espaço-temporal de raízes finas e dos 
gases de efeito estufa em camadas profundas do solo é um componente chave para 
identificar práticas silviculturais mais sustentáveis para florestas plantadas num 
contexto de mudança climática e para melhorar os atuais modelos biogeoquímicos.  

Nosso estudo teve como objetivo avaliar o efeito do corte raso e da seca na produção 
de raízes finas, nos efluxos de CO2, CH4 e N2O do solo e da produção ao longo dos 
perfis profundos do solo até o lençol freático nas plantações de eucalipto manejadas 
em talhadia. A raízes finas foram amostradas até 17 m de profundidade num 
experimento de exclusão de chuva comparando parcelas com 37% de precipitação 
excluída (-W) e sem exclusão de chuva (+ W). A dinâmica das raízes foi estudada 
usando minirhizotron em duas trincheiras permanentes até 17 m de profundidade nos 
tratamentos -W e + W, durante 1 ano antes do corte raso e 2 anos depois do corte em 
talhadia, e tambem até 4 m de profundidade numa parcela sem corte (NH), servindo 
como controle. Os efluxos de CO2, CH4 e N2O na superfície do solo foram medidos ao 
longo de três anos utilizando o método de câmara manual nos tratamentos -W, + W e 
NH. As concentrações de CO2, CH4 e N2O no solo foram medidas a partir das 
trincheiras até uma profundidade de 15.5 m nos tratamentos -W, + W e NH durante 3 
meses antes do corte raso e 1.5 ano depois em talhadia.  

Após o corte, ocorreu um grande crescimento radicular das árvores conduzidas em 
talhadia nas camadas muito profundas do solo (&gt; 13 m) e, surpreendentemente, a 
mortalidade das raízes permaneceu extremamente baixa, independentemente da 
profundidade e do tratamento. A biomassa total de raízes finas em talhadia até 17 m 
de profundidade foi de 1266 e 1017 g m-2 em + W e -W, respectivamente, 1.5 ano 
após o corte raso, e 1078 g m-2 em NH 7.5 anos após o plantio. O comprimento 
específico e a área específica das raízes foram cerca de 15% maiores em -W do que 
em + W. Os efluxos de CO2, CH4 e N2O não foram significativamente diferentes entre 
-W e + W e não alteraram após o corte raso nas parcelas manejadas por talhadia em 
comparação com o povoamento não colhido. As concentrações de CO2 e CH4 
aumentaram muito com a profundidade e as concentrações de N2O permaneceram 
aproximadamente constantes na superfície do solo até uma profundidade de 15.5 m. 
As concentrações médias de CO2 e N2O em -W foram 20.7% e 7.6% menores que em 
+ W, respectivamente, e as concentrações de CH4 em -W foram 44.4% maiores que 
em + W em todo o perfil de solo. Um modelo de difusividade mostrou que a produção 
e o consumo de CO2, N2O e CH4 ocorreram em grandes profundidades e foram 
similares nos tratamentos + W, -W e NH. O corte raso não aumentou os efluxos e as 
produções de CO2, CH4 e N2O, independentemente do regime de abastecimento de 
água.  

O estabelecimento de sistemas radiculares profundos em florestas tropicais plantadas 
pode ajudar as árvores a resistir aos longos períodos de seca esperados pelas 
mudanças climáticas em muitas regiões tropicais Nosso estudo em plantações de 
eucaliptos manejados em talhadia, representativas de grandes áreas tropicais, sugere 
que as emissões de gases de efeito estufa podem ser pouco influenciadas pelas 
mudanças nos padrões de precipitação devido às mudanças climáticas. 

Palavras-chave: Brazil. Eucalyptus grandis. crescimento de raízes profundas. gases 
de efeito estufa. exclusão de chuvas. solo tropical muito profundo. Talhadia. 



 
 

 
 

 

Contexto 

O crescimento das árvores é altamente dependente da função de absorção das raízes 

finas para a água e os nutrientes. Raízes finas também desempenham um papel 

importante no ciclo global de carbono (C), principalmente nos processos de produção, 

respiração, exsudação e decomposição. Melhorar a compreensão da dinâmica 

espaço-temporal de raízes finas ao longo de todo o perfil do solo até o lençol freático 

é importante para identificar práticas silviculturais mais sustentáveis para as florestas 

plantadas. Após uma forte expansão nos últimos 20 anos, as plantações florestais 

representam 7% da área florestal total do mundo (KEENAN et al., 2015). Em regiões 

tropicais e subtropicais, as plantações industriais de eucalipto de rápido crescimento, 

participam no armazenamento de carbono atmosférico e ajudam a reduzir a 

exploração das florestas naturais fornecendo um proporção crescente da demanda 

mundial em madeira (KEENAN et al., 2015). As plantações de eucalipto de rápido 

crescimento cobrem cerca de 20 milhões de hectares em todo o mundo (BOOTH, 

2013), incluindo cerca de 5.67 milhões de hectares no Brasil (IBA, 2016). As florestas 

tropicais têm uma forte influência nas concentrações de dióxido de carbono (CO2), 

óxido nitroso (N2O) e metano (CH4) na atmosfera. As práticas silviculturais nas 

florestas plantadas afetam os fluxos de gases de efeito estufa na superfície do solo e 

os principais determinantes da produção de gases de efeito estufa nos solos florestais 

(substrato, temperatura, teor de água) variam em função da profundidade do solo. No 

Brasil, a maioria das plantações de eucalipto são estabelecidas em solos com baixa 

fertilidade e submetidas a períodos de seca de até 6 meses (GONÇALVES et al., 

2013). Apesar das projeções sobre o futuro das precipitações ainda sejam difíceis de 

prever em nível local, estudos mostraram que o aquecimento global será associado a 

uma intensificação das estações secas em muitas partes do globo (SOLOMON et al., 

2009). especialmente em regiões subtropicais já sujeitas a secas severas (MEEHL et 

al., 2007). Neste contexto, o manejo do Eucalyptus através da talhadia tem sido 

praticado por empresas do setor florestal no Brasil e pode ser uma vantagem contra 

o estresse hídrico, uma vez que as brotações do Eucalyptus já possuem um sistema 

radicular formado em camadas profundas, onde as quantidades de água disponíveis 

podem ser maiores. As conseqüências do corte raso das árvores na dinâmica 

radicular no primeiro ano de rotação de plantações em talhadia implicam questões 



 
 

        
 

específicas nunca estudadas nas camadas profundas do solo. Além disso, o corte da 

parte aérea das árvores tem um impacto significativo na saída de carbono do 

ecossistema e nas emissões de gases de efeito estufa. Após o corte, a mortalidade 

das raízes leva à um suprimento de matéria orgânica fresca em diferentes 

profundidades (BERHONGARAY et al., 2015). A decomposição da matéria orgânica 

fresca pode promover a degradação da matéria orgânica existente (DERRIEN et al., 

2014; FONTAINE et al., 2007) com um "efeito priming" (KUZYAKOV et al., 2000). O 

"efeito priming" pode afetar o armazenamento de carbono pelo ecossistema e afetar 

indiretamente o ciclo do nitrogênio. Existe pouca pesquisa sobre os ciclos 

biogeoquímicos em plantações florestais manejadas em talhadia, e nenhuma 

comparando experimentalmente estresse hídrico (exclusão de chuva) e precipitação 

normal. A avaliação da contribuição das raízes finas profundas e da dinâmica espaço-

temporal das concentrações de gases de efeito estufa nas camadas profundas do solo 

é um verdadeiro desafio metrológico e uma grande barreira científica, a qual é 

importante levantar para estudar a sustentabilidade das plantações florestais e sua 

resiliência no contexto das mudanças climáticas globais. O objetivo principal da tese 

é avaliar o efeito do corte e da redução de chuva na produção das raízes finas, CO2, 

CH4 e N2O ao longo do perfil do solo até o lençol freático. Estes efeitos foram 

acompanhados antes e após o corte raso das árvores em uma plantação de 

Eucalyptus grandis conduzida em talhadia e submetida à dois regimes hídricos 

contrastantes. 

Os objetivos específicos da tese são: 

- Melhorar a compreensão da influência das chuvas sobre a mortalidade e a 

produção de raízes finas em função da profundidade do solo em plantações 

conduzidas por talhadia; 

- Avaliar o efeito do corte raso e do manejo em talhadia sobre a dinâmica das 

raízes finas até 17 m de profundidade; 

- Avaliar a dinâmica de raízes finas, CO2, CH4 e N2O próxima ao lençol freático 

(17 m de profundidade) em tratamentos com dois níveis de pluviosidade 

contrastantes; 

- Determinar o perfil vertical das taxas de produção de CO2, CH4 e N2O a partir 

da superfície até uma profundidade de 17 m, através de amostragens dos 



 
 

 
 

gases, seguida de análises por cromatografia gasosa e modelagem da 

produção e do transporte no solo. 

Estratégia de pesquisa 

Os experimentos deste doutorado ocorreram no Brasil, na Estação Experimental de 

Itatinga (Estado de São Paulo), destinada à descrição, quantificação e modelagem do 

funcionamento dos ecossistemas florestais tropicais. A precipitação média anual nesta 

área é de 1390 mm; a vegetação dominante é o eucalipto; o solo é muito profundo (&gt; 

15m) do tipo arenoso ferralítico (LACLAU et al., 2010). Uma plantação de Eucalyptus 

grandis de mais de dois hectares foi instalada em 2010 em um delineamento em 

parcelas subdivididas (split-plot) com 3 blocos. O principal fator estudado é a redução 

da chuva e o fator secundário é a fertilização potássica. O trabalho de tese concentra-

se em modalidades com adubação potássica não limitante como em plantações 

comerciais no Brasil, comparando chuvas não perturbadas e exclusão parcial por um 

sistema de calhas para coletar e excluir 37% das chuvas.  

Duas trincheiras profundas (17 m de profundidade x 1.5 m de diâmetro) foram 

escavadas no início de 2014 em tratamentos com e sem exclusão de chuva e estão 

equipadas com plataformas que facilitam a manipulação e medições em 

profundidades diferentes. 

As árvores foram cortadas no experimento em junho de 2016, com a idade de 6 anos, 

e a plantação foi conduzida em talhadia após o corte raso. No entanto, uma parcela 

de referência (NH) foi mantida com as árvores existentes (fertilização e chuvas não 

perturbadas). Nesta parcela, uma terceira trincheira de 3 m de profundidade foi 

escavada e preparada. 

Desde sua criação em 2014, as duas trincheiras profundas foram equipadas com 

minirhizotrons para monitorar a dinâmica das raízes (MAEGHT et al., 2013). Vinte e 

quatro tubos transparentes de 180 cm de comprimento foram instalados a 45° dentro 

das trincheiras permanentes (12 por trincheira) e permitiram a observação das raízes 

130 cm abaixo de cada ponto de instalação (na superfície, 1.0, 3.5, 5.5, 7.5, 9.5, 11.5, 

13.5 e 15.5 m). Sete tubos foram instalados na parcela de referência (superfície, 1 e 

3.5 m). 



 
 

        
 

A observação das raízes foi realizada por aquisição de imagem por meio de um 

scanner circular (CI-600 Root Growth Monitoring System, CID, EUA). Oito imagens 

(21.59 cm x 19.56 centímetros) no tubo foram tomadas a cada duas semanas desde 

Maio de 2015: um ano antes do corte das árvores e durante 2 anos após o corte das 

árvores, em Junho de 2016. As imagens foram analisadas usando o software 

WinRHIZOtron (Regent, Canadá) para traçar as raízes, marcando o comprimento e 

diâmetro para estimar o crescimento ao longo do tempo.  

Raízes finas (diâmetro&amp;lt;2 mm) foram amostradas até a profundidade de 17 m para 

estimar a biomassa (raízes vivas) e necromassa em todo o perfil do solo, 1.5 anos 

após o corte nos tratamentos + W, -W e 7.5 anos após o plantio no tratamento NH. 

As emissões de gases do solo  foram medidas colocando um sino (diâmetro de 40 

cm, altura de 10 cm) sobre uma base de amostragem instalada no local experimental. 

Quatro câmaras foram colocadas aleatoriamente à quatro distâncias das árvores em 

cada tratamento. As câmaras foram fechadas cada vez por 30 minutos. Uma alíquota 

de ar ambiente foié coletada com uma seringa quatro vezes consecutivas (0, 10 min, 

20 min e 30 min) após o fechamento. As medições foram feitas a cada duas semanas: 

três meses antes do corte e 1.5 anos após o corte. Câmaras de respiração no solo (9 

por tratamento e bloco) também foram conectadas à um analisador Li-Cor 8100 (Li-

cor, Lincoln, Ne, EUA) para monitorar as emissões de CO2 na superfície do solo 

medido a cada duas semanas. Para coletar regularmente os gases do solo (duas 

vezes por mês: três meses antes do corte e 1.5 anos após o corte), as trincheiras 

foram equipadas com seringas instaladas em profundidades (METAY et al., 2007) 

também cobertas por imagens de minirhizotrons (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 3.5, 7.5, 11.5 e 15.5 

m). As concentrações dos gases foram determinadas por cromatografia gasosa (GC-

ECD). Os dados foram aplicados à um modelo de difusividade para estimar os fluxos 

de CO2, N2O e CH4, bem como a produção de cada camada de solo a partir das 

concentrações medidas nas trincheiras. 

Principais resultados 

O sistema de redução de chuva implantado resultou em uma diminuição significativa 

do conteúdo de água do solo, em média uma redução de 12.9% em -W em 

comparação ao + W, da superfície a uma profundidade de 16 m. Este dispositivo 

mostrou-se eficaz para estudar dois regimes de precipitação contrastante. Após o 



 
 

 
 

corte das árvores houve uma interrupção da transpiração da parte aérea, e 

consequentemente o solo foi recarregado com água. O teor de água no solo foi menor 

no tratamento -W em relação ao tratamento + W antes do corte, essa diferença entre 

os dois tratamentos persistiu um ano e meio após o corte. 

Em primeiro lugar investigamos o impacto da redução de chuvas e do corte raso das 

árvores na dinâmica radicular em uma plantação de eucalipto conduzida em talhadia. 

Nossos resultados mostraram que as taxas diárias de crescimento radicular foram 

fortemente dependentes da profundidade e da estação nos tratamentos + W e -W. 

Após o corte das árvores, o crescimento de raízes finas começou nas camadas 

superiores do solo e foi crescendo ao longo do tempo em profundidade em ambos os 

tratamentos + W e -W. Assim, quando a plantação é conduzida em talhadia, após o 

corte das árvores, o início do crecimento radicular foi observado pela primeira vez 6 

meses após o corte na superfície. Na profundidade 3.5-4.8 m do solo 12 meses após 

o corte e na profundidade 13.5-14.8 m do solo 16 meses após o corte, nos tratamentos 

+ W e -W. As taxas diárias de crecimento alongamento das raízes atingiram o pico no 

final da estação seca para todas as camadas do solo nas profundidades &gt; 6 m, quando 

o teor de água no solo diminuiu nas camadas superficiais. Assim, os valores diários 

de alongamento das raízes não foram necessariamente correlacionados com os níveis 

de umidade do solo para uma dada camada de solo. Observamos uma sincronização 

entre a diminuição da quantidade de água extraível na camada superficial e os picos 

de alongamento das raízes após o corte no tratamento -W. Além disso, vimos que a 

densidade das raízes finas reduz abaixo de 20 cm de profundidade, depois diminui 

gradualmente até o lençol freático nos três tratamentos NH, + W e -W. A biomassa 

total de raízes finas em talhadia até 17 m de profundidade foi de 1266 e 1017 g m-2 

em + W e -W, respectivamente, 1.5 ano após o corte raso, e 1078 g m-2 em NH 7.5 

anos após o plantio. A densidade de raízes finas foi cerca de 25% maior em -W do 

que em + W e NH na maioria das camadas do solo. Em profundidades &gt; 7 m, as 

densidades de raízes finas foram pelo menos duas vezes maiores em -W que em + 

W e NH, respectivamente. 

Além disso, estávamos também interessados no efeito da redução de chuva sobre a 

adaptação morfológica das raízes finas em todo o perfil do solo. Nos tratamentos NH, 

+ W e -W, mostramos que a profundidade teve pouco efeito no comprimento 

específico das raízes (SRL), na área específico das raízes (SRA) e no diâmetro das 



 
 

        
 

raízes finas. SRL e SRA foram significativamente maiores em -W que em + W, e 

valores semelhantes foram observados em + W e NH. Até 17 m de profundidade, os 

valores médios de SRL foram 28.8, 30.6 e 34.4 m g-1, os valores médios de SRA de 

258.8, 267.5 e 305.3 cm2 g-1 e os diâmetros médios das raízes finas de 0.31, 0.32 e 

0.36 mm nos tratamentos NH, + W e -W, respectivamente. Durante todo o período de 

estudo (3 anos) o comprimento acumulado de raízes mortas representou 6-7% do 

comprimento total de raízes produzido em todo o perfil do solo até 17 m de 

profundidade em ambos os tratamentos W e -W. Surpreendentemente, o comprimento 

das raízes finas mortas não aumentou após o corte raso das árvores e não diferiu 

entre as profundidades do solo e entre os tratamentos + W e -W. 

Em seguida, analisamos o impacto do corte raso das árvores e da redução da 

precipitação nas emissões de gases de efeito estufa, bem como sua produção / 

consumo em todo o perfil do solo. Os fluxos cumulativos de CO2 medidos nos 

tratamentos + W e -W foram 136.5 ± 21.8 mol m-2 e 130.3 ± 24.8 mol m-2 ano-1 no 

último ano antes do corte raso das árvores e 108.0 ± 15.8 e 119.3 ± 22.5 mol m-2 ano-

1 no primeiro ano após o corte raso quando a plantação foi conduzida em talhadia. 

Não encontramos diferenças significativas entre as emissão de CO2, CH4 e N2O entre 

os dois tratamentos + W e -W. Os fluxos de CH4 foram negativos ao longo do período 

de estudo, de março de 2016 a dezembro de 2017, indicando um consumo líquido de 

CH4 atmosférico pelo solo. Não foram observadas diferenças significativas entre os 

tratamentos NH e + W nas emissões de CO2, CH4 e N2O mostrando nenhum efeito do 

corte das árvores. 

Os efluxos de CO2, CH4, e N2O não foram significativamente diferentes entre -W e + 

W e não mudaram após o corte das árvores nas parcelas manejadas em talhadia 

comparado às parcelas sem corte raso. As concentrações de CO2 e CH4 aumentaram 

significativamente com a profundidade e as concentrações de N2O permaneceram 

constantes da superfície a uma profundidade de 15.5 m. As concentrações médias de 

CO2 e N2O em -W foram, respectivamente, inferior de 20.7% e 7.6% a os de +W e as 

concentrações de CH4 foram 44.4% superior em -W do que em + W sobre a totalidade 

do perfil do solo. O modelo de difusividade mostrou que a produção e o consumo de 

CO2, N2O e CH4 ocorreu em grandes profundidades e foram semelhantes nos 

tratamentos + W, W, e NH. O corte raso das árvores não aumentou os efluxos e as 

produções de CO2, CH4 e N2O independentemente do regime de água. 



 
 

 
 

As produções de CO2, CH4, e N2O entre 0.1 e 15.5 m de profundidade, não foram 

significativamente diferentes entre + W e -W. As produções mais elevadas de CO2 e 

N2O e a menor produção de CH4 foram estimadas na superficie do solo devido ao 

forte gradiente de concentrações e a maior difusividade efetiva calculada na camada 

superficial do solo. A produção de CO2 e N2O e o consumo de CH4 ocorreu 

principalmente na superfície e uma parte da produção de CO2 e CH4 atingiu uma 

profundidade de até 15.5 m. 

Discussão geral 

A principal novidade dos nossos resultados está na primeira observação direta da 

fenologia das raízes finas, bem como nas primeiras medições in situ das 

concentrações de CO2, N2O e CH4 em profundidades à mais de 10 m em uma 

plantação de eucalipto conduzida em talhadia. As conseqüências do corte raso das 

árvores e da redução das chuvas na dinâmica da produção de raízes finas e dos gases 

de efeito estufa em plantações florestais levantam questões específicas que nunca 

foram estudadas em um perfil de solo profundo em clima tropical. 

Efeito da redução de chuva 

Diante de uma seca induzida, o eucalipto aumentou a densidade de raízes finas em 

grande profundidade. O crescimento das raízes em camadas profundas do solo pode 

aumentar a quantidade de água disponível necessária para o crecimento das árvores, 

o que poderia ser um benefício crítico para as árvores em condições severas de seca 

(CHRISTINA et al., 2017). Após o corte, observou-se um grande crescimento das 

raízes à mais de 4 m de profundidade no final da temporada seca, independentemente 

do tratamento. O crescimento das raízes finas nas camadas profundas do solo 

começou quando o teor de água na camada de 0-2 m caiu abaixo de um limiar de 

cerca de 80 mm, sugerindo que o teor de umidade no solo, em uma determinada 

camada do solo, não foi o principal fator responsável pelo crescimento das raízes 

finas. Sucessivos afrouxamentos no crescimento radicular da superfície do solo para 

suas camadas mais profundas, no final da temporada seca e nos primeiros meses 

após o início da temporada chuvosa nos tratamentos + W e –W, seria devido ao rápido 

esgotamento dos recursos hídricos superficiais, o que induziria as raízes das árvores 

a buscarem as camadas mais profundas do solo (BILLINGS, 2015; SCHENK E 

JACKSON, 2002). 



 
 

        
 

Além disso, mostramos que os eucaliptos em condições de seca adaptaram sua 

morfologia radicular para maximizar a superfície das raízes em contato com o solo 

para absorver os recursos limitados. Os valores de SRL e SRA foram maiores em -W 

que em + W, o que combinado com maiores densidades de raízes finas levaria à um 

índice de superfície de raiz muito maior. Nosso estudo mostrou que o eucalipto pode 

modificar as características das raízes finas para melhorar a captura de recursos e a 

exploração de camadas muitas profundas do solo, a fim de sua sobrevivência em um 

contexto de mudanças climáticas ajudando assim, a manter a absorção de água 

durante períodos secos (BRUNNER et al., 2015; CHRISTINA et al., 2017). 

A exclusão da chuva não teve efeito nos fluxos de CO2, N2O e CH4 medidos na 

superfície ou calculados em profundidade com um modelo de difusividade. As 

diferenças na concentração de gás no solo, medidas entre + W e -W, são 

provavelmente devido ao maior teor de água do solo em + W que poderia reduzir a 

difusividade dos gases, enquanto as emissões não foram afetadas. No tratamento + 

W, o alto teor de água no perfil do solo pode induzir a saturação do espaço intersticial 

pela água e causar uma lenta difusão dos gases de efeito estufa para a atmosfera 

(MAIER et al., 2017; WANG et al., 2018). A estrutura de poros e agregados do solo 

está diretamente relacionada à liberação de gases de efeito estufa, mas também ao 

armazenamento de carbono (MANGALASSERY et al., 2013; SMITH et al., 2004). 

As produções de CO2, CH4 e N2O não foram significativamente diferentes entre os 

tratamentos + W e -W até uma profundidade de 15.5 m. No entanto, observamos que 

a produção pode diminuir nas camadas superiores e aumentar nas camadas 

profundas. Nós mostramos que a biomassa de raízes e o índice de área de raiz 

aumentaram em aproximadamente 25% e 24%, respectivamente, no tratamento de 

exclusão de chuva comparado com a parcela de controle a uma profundidade de 17 

m, e que a biomassa das raízes aumentou principalmente nas profundidades &gt; 7 m. 

Portanto, a mudança nas produções de CO2 nas camadas mais profundas observadas 

em nosso estudo pode ser devido à uma mudança nas atividades das raízes para 

horizontes mais profundos, indicando um aumento da captação de água na 

profundidade pelas raízes (SCHWENDENMANN et al., 2010; SOTTA et al., 2007). 

Também observamos uma mudança no consumo de CH4 nas camadas profundas no 

tratamento de exclusão de chuva. A mudança no consumo de CH4 para camadas mais 



 
 

 
 

profundas pode ser devido às condições do solo mais favoráveis à metanotrofia, mas 

menos à metanogênese. Mais estudos são necessários para avaliar os efeitos da 

exclusão de chuva nas comunidades microbianas, suas atividades e interações, e 

particularmente nas camadas profundas do solo. 

Efeito do corte raso das árvores 

Descobrimos que poucas raízes foram perdidas pela mortalidade (&lt;10% de todas as 

raízes observadas ao longo de 3 anos), sugerindo que a maior parte do sistema 

radicular permanece funcional após o corte raso das árvores conduzidas em talhadia. 

O nosso estudo sugere que árvores de Eucalyptus grandis de 6 anos de idade têm 

reservas suficientes no sistema radicular e que as condições apropriadas do solo para 

manter a biomassa radicular estabelecida até o lençol fréatico após o corte tenha, 

provavelmente, também contribuído para o crescimento inicial das rebrotas 

(BRUNNER et al., 2015; DRAKE et al., 2013). 

A assincronia no sistema radicular, atrasando o crescimento das raízes nas camadas 

mais profundas do solo poderia ser uma estratégia para maximizar a absorção de 

água e nutrientes necessárias para atender a alta demanda das árvores de rápido 

crescimento. O crescimento das raízes ocorreu a uma profundidade de 14 m em 

menos de um ano após o corte das árvores conduzidas em talhadia, enquanto a 

profundidade máxima atingida pelas raízes de E. grandis é de aproximadamente 7 m 

um ano após o plantio em solos muito profundos (CHRISTINA et al., 2011; LACLAU 

et al., 2013). As raízes profundas permitem o acesso à grandes quantidades de água 

armazenada no subsolo após o corte e, apesar da baixa densidade de raízes finas 

nas camadas mais profundas do solo, são suficientes para absorver grandes 

quantidades de água (CHRISTINA et al., 2017). A baixa mortalidade de raízes finas 

após o corte sugerem que o manejo em talhadia das plantações de eucalipto pode ser 

uma opção promissora para lidar com a seca, uma vez que o sistema de radicular 

existente permite o acesso à água armazenada nos horizontes profundos. 

Contrariamente às nossas expectativas, o corte das árvores não levou ao aumento de 

emissões e produção de CO2, CH4 e N2O, independentemente do regime hídrico. A 

colheita de eucaliptos em plantações manejadas em rotações curtas leva a grandes 

alterações no ambiente do solo, provavelmente aumentando o processo de 

decomposição da matéria orgânica, como o aumento da temperatura do solo e 



 
 

        
 

umidade do solo, bem como acúmulo de resíduos de colheita na superfície do solo 

(CHRISTINA et al., 2017; MENDHAM et al., 2002; O'CONNELL et al., 2004; ROCHA 

et al., 2016). Nós mostramos que o corte das árvores não levou à um aumento da 

mortalidade das raízes no primeiro ano após o corte, quando a plantação foi conduzida 

em talhadia, independentemente do regime hídrico. Portanto, assumimos que o corte 

raso resultando em emissões da mesma intendisidade que antes do corte das arvores 

em nosso experimento pode resultar de uma diminuição na respiração das raízes após 

a colheita, compensa-se a um aumento na decomposição da matéria orgânica na 

superfície do solo. 

Conclusão geral 

A fenologia das raízes finas do eucalipto em talhadia submetidas à regimes hídricos 

contrastantes revelou taxas de mortalidade muito baixas. O crescimento inicial da 

parte aérea após o corte das árvores beneficiou-se do sistema radicular estabelecido 

na rotação anterior, e o crescimento assíncrono das raízes finas com a profundidade 

revelou a plasticidade das árvores em resposta às condições do solo. O 

estabelecimento de sistemas radiculares profundos em florestas tropicais plantadas 

poderia ajudar as árvores a resistir aos longos períodos de seca esperados em muitas 

regiões tropicais num contexto de mudanças climáticas. 

Além disso, mostramos que o corte raso das árvores não aumentou significativamente 

as emissões de CO2, N2O e CH4 quando o plantio é conduzido em talhadia em 

comparação com uma plantação não cortada. As emissões de gases pós-corte são 

consistentes com as baixas taxas de mortalidade de raízes observadas. Por outro 

lado, raízes profundas também poderiam contribuir para sequestrar grandes 

quantidades de C no solo. As alocações subterrâneas de carbono representam cerca 

de 20-30% da produtividade primária bruta nas plantações de eucalipto (EPRON et 

al., 2012; NOUVELLON et al., 2012; RYAN et al., 2010). O carbono das raízes é 

geralmente retido por mais tempo no solo do que da serapilheira, que é mais afetada 

por processos físico-químicos e também devido às diferenças na composição 

estrutural entre as folhas e as raízes (MENICHETTI et al., 2015; RASSE et al., 2005; 

SCHMIDT et al., 2011). Mais estudos são necessários para determinar se o manejo 

em talhadia das plantações de eucalipto em solos muito profundos pode ser uma 



 
 

 
 

opção efetiva para mitigar o aumento de gases de efeito estufa na atmosfera e 

aumentar o armazenamento de C no solo. 

Solos tropicais muito profundos cobrem grandes áreas do mundo e é fundamental 

aumentar nossa compreensão sobre a dinâmica espaço-temporal das concentrações 

de gases de efeito estufa nas camadas profundas, a fim de quantificar com mais 

precisão fontes / armazenamento de C para estimar o orçamento global de carbono, 

melhorar os atuais modelos biogeoquímicos para a previsão de emissões de gases 

de efeito estufa e identificar práticas silviculturais mais sustentáveis para florestas 

tropicais plantadas no contexto das mudanças climáticas. 

  



 
 

        
 

RESUME 
 
Améliorer notre compréhension de la dynamique spatio-temporelle des racines fines 
et des gaz à effet de serre dans les couches profondes du sol est un élément clé pour 
identifier des pratiques sylvicoles plus durables pour les forêts plantées dans un 
contexte de changement climatique et pour améliorer les modèles biogéochimiques 
actuels. 
Cette étude visait à évaluer l’effet de la coupe des arbres et de la sécheresse sur la 
production de racines fines et la production de CO2, N2O et CH4 dans des profils de 
sol très profonds en plantation d’Eucalyptus conduite en taillis au Brésil. Les racines 
fines, d’un diamètre inférieur à 2 millimètres, ont été échantillonnées jusqu’à une 
profondeur de 17 m sur un dispositif d’exclusion de pluie comparant des peuplements 
soumis à une exclusion de 37% des pluies (-W) et des peuplements sans exclusion (+ 
W). La dynamique des racines a été étudiée à l’aide de minirhizotrons installés dans 
deux fosses permanentes d’une profondeur de 17 m dans les traitement -W et + W, 
pendant un an avant la coupe des arbres, puis pendant deux ans en taillis, et jusqu’à 
4 m de profondeur dans un peuplement non récolté (NH) servant de témoin. Les efflux 
de CO2, CH4 et N2O à la surface du sol ont été mesurés durant trois ans dans les 
traitements -W, + W et NH. Les concentrations en CO2, CH4 et N2O dans le sol ont été 
mesurées à partir de fosses permanentes jusqu'à une profondeur de 15.5 m dans les 
traitements -W, + W et NH durant 3 mois avant la coupe des arbres et 1.5 ans après 
la coupe, en taillis. 
La croissance des racines fines était considérable à grande profondeur (&gt; 13 m) chez 
les arbres menés en taillis et, étonnamment, la mortalité des racines fines était 
extrêmement faible quelle que soit la profondeur et le traitement. La biomasse totale 
de racines fines jusqu’à 17 m de profondeur était de 1266 et 1017 g m-2 dans les 
traitements - W et +W, respectivement, 1.5 an après la coupe des arbres et de 1078 g 
m-2 dans le traitement NH, 7.5 ans après la plantation. La longueur spécifique et la 
surface spécifique des racines fines étaient environ 15% plus élevées dans les 
peuplements -W que dans les peuplements +W. Les émissions de CO2, CH4 et N2O à 
la surface du sol ne différaient pas significativement entre -W et + W et ne changeaient 
pas après la coupe des arbres dans les peuplements menés en taillis par rapport aux 
peuplements non exploités. Alors que les concentrations en CO2 et CH4 augmentaient 
fortement avec la profondeur, les concentrations en N2O étaient pratiquement 
constantes de la surface du sol jusqu'à une profondeur de 15.5 m. Les concentrations 
moyennes en CO2 et en N2O dans les sols -W étaient respectivement inférieures de 
20.7% et 7.6% à celles dans les sols +W et les concentrations en CH4 dans les sols -
W étaient de 44.4% supérieures à celles dans les sols +W. Un modèle de diffusivité a 
montré que les productions de CO2, N2O et CH4 étaient similaires dans les traitements 
+ W, -W et NH. La coupe des arbres n'a pas augmenté les émissions de CO2, de CH4 
et de N2O, quel que soit le régime hydrique. 
La mise en place de systèmes racinaires profonds dans les forêts tropicales plantées 
pourrait permettre aux arbres de résister aux périodes de sécheresse attendues dans 
un contexte de changement climatique. Notre étude réalisée dans des peuplements 
d'eucalyptus gérés en taillis, représentatifs de vastes zones tropicales, suggère que 
les émissions de gaz à effet de serre pourraient être peu influencées par les 
modifications de régimes de précipitations dus au changement climatique.

Contexte 

La croissance des arbres dépend fortement de la fonction d'absorption des racines 

fines pour l'eau et les nutriments. Les racines fines jouent également un rôle important 

dans le cycle global du carbone (C), principalement dans les processus de production, 

de respiration, d'exsudation et de décomposition. Améliorer la compréhension de la 

dynamique spatio-temporelle des racines fines sur tout le profil de sol jusqu’à la nappe 

phréatique est important pour identifier des pratiques sylvicoles plus durables pour les 

forêts plantées.  

Après une forte expansion au cours des 20 dernières années, les plantations 

forestières représentent 7% de la superficie forestière totale du monde (KEENAN et 

al., 2015). Dans les régions tropicales et subtropicales, les plantations d'essences à 

croissance rapide stockent de grandes quantités de carbone et contribuent à réduire 

l'exploitation des forêts naturelles en fournissant une proportion croissante de la 

demande mondiale en bois (KEENAN et al., 2015). Les plantations d'eucalyptus à 

croissance rapide couvrent environ 20 millions d'hectares dans le monde (BOOTH, 

2013), dont environ 5.67 millions d'hectares au Brésil (IBA, 2016). Les forêts tropicales 

ont une forte influence sur les concentrations de dioxyde de carbone (CO2), d’oxyde 

nitreux (N2O) et de méthane (CH4) dans l’atmosphère. Les pratiques sylvicoles dans 

les forêts plantées affectent les efflux de gaz à effet de serre à la surface du sol parce 

qu’elles modifient les principaux facteurs qui déterminent la production de gaz à effet 

de serre dans les sols forestiers (substrat, température, teneur en eau) qui varient en 

fonction de la profondeur.  

Au Brésil, la plupart des plantations forestières sont établies dans des zones à faible 

fertilité du sol et caractérisées par de longues périodes de sécheresse. Les projections 

climatiques futures prévoient des périodes sèches plus longues et plus fortes en 

Amérique du Sud (SOLOMON et al., 2009). Dans ce contexte, la gestion sylvicole en 

taillis des plantations d’Eucalyptus peut être un avantage contre le stress hydrique 

parce que les arbres bénéficient d'un système racinaire déjà développé et explorant 

les couches profondes du sol où l’eau y est plus disponible. Les conséquences de la 

coupe des arbres sur la dynamique des racines lors de la première année de rotation 

des plantations menée en taillis posent des questions spécifiques jamais étudiées, 

notamment sur les effets dans les couches profondes du sol. De plus, la récolte des 



 
 

        
 

parties aériennes des arbres a un impact important sur le bilan de carbone et les 

émissions de gaz à effet de serre de l'écosystème. Après la coupe, la mortalité 

racinaire conduit à un apport de matière organique fraiche à différentes profondeurs 

(BERHONGARAY et al., 2015). La décomposition de la matière organique fraîche peut 

favoriser la dégradation de la matière organique préexistante (DERRIEN et al., 2014; 

FONTAINE et al., 2007) grâce à un "priming effect" (KUZYAKOV et al., 2000). Le 

"priming effect" pourrait affecter le stockage de carbone par l'écosystème et influer 

indirectement sur le cycle de l'azote. Peu d’études portent sur les cycles 

biogéochimiques dans des plantations forestières avec une gestion sylvicole en taillis, 

et aucune comparant expérimentalement un stress hydrique (exclusion de pluie) et 

une pluviométrie non perturbée sous climat tropical. L’évaluation de la contribution des 

racines fines profondes et de la dynamique spatio-temporelle des concentrations de 

gaz à effet de serre dans les couches profondes du sol est un véritable défi 

métrologique et un verrou scientifique majeur qu’il est important de lever pour étudier 

la durabilité des plantations forestières, ainsi que leur résilience dans le contexte des 

changements globaux. L'objectif principal de la thèse est d'évaluer l'effet de la coupe 

et d’une réduction de pluie sur la production de racines fines, de CO2, de CH4 et de 

N2O le long du profil du sol jusqu'à la nappe phréatique. Ces effets ont été suivis avant 

et après la coupe des arbres dans une plantation d’Eucalyptus grandis menée en taillis, 

soumis à deux régimes hydrique contrastés.  

Les objectifs spécifiques de la thèse sont : 

- D’améliorer la compréhension de l'influence des précipitations sur la production 

et la mortalité des racines fines sur l'ensemble du profil de sol dans les 

plantations menées en taillis ; 

- D’évaluer l'effet de la coupe et d’une gestion en taillis sur la dynamique des 

racines fines jusqu'à 17 m de profondeur ; 

- D’évaluer la dynamique des racines fines, du CO2, du CH4 et du N2O près de la 

nappe phréatique (17 m de profondeur) soumis à deux niveaux de précipitations 

contrastés ; 

- Déterminer la production de CO2, de CH4 et de N2O de la surface à une 

profondeur de 17 m 

 



 
 

 
 

Stratégie de recherche 

Les expérimentations de ce doctorat se sont déroulées au Brésil sur la station 

expérimentale d’Itatinga (Etat de São Paulo). Ce site expérimental est destiné à la 

description, la quantification et la modélisation du fonctionnement des écosystèmes 

forestier tropicaux. Les précipitations annuelles moyennes sur cette zone sont de 1390 

mm, la végétation dominante est l’eucalyptus, le sol est très profond (&gt; 15m) et de type 

ferralitique sableux (LACLAU et al., 2010). Une plantation d’Eucalyptus grandis de plus 

de deux hectares a été mise en place en 2010 sur un dispositif en parcelles divisées 

(split plot) avec 3 blocs. Le facteur principal étudié est la réduction de pluie. Les travaux 

de thèse se sont focalisés sur les modalités avec fertilisation potassique non limitante 

comme dans les plantations commerciales au Brésil, en comparant pluviométrie non 

perturbée et exclusion partielle par un système de gouttière permettant de récolter et 

d’exclure 37% des pluviolessivats. 

Deux fosses profondes de 17 m de profondeur et 1.5m de diamètre ont été creusées 

début 2014 sur les traitements avec et sans exclusion de pluies, et équipées de paliers 

facilitant l’instrumentation et les mesures à différentes profondeurs.  

Les arbres ont été coupés sur le dispositif en Juin 2016 à l’âge de 6 ans, et la plantation 

a été ensuite menée en taillis. Une parcelle de référence (NH) est toutefois maintenue 

avec les arbres en place (fertilisation et pluies non perturbées). Sur cette parcelle une 

troisième fosse de 3 m de profondeur a été creusée et instrumentée.  

Depuis leur création en 2014, les deux fosses profondes ont été équipées de 

minirhizotrons pour le suivi de la dynamique racinaire (MAEGHT et al., 2013). 24 tubes 

transparents de 180 cm de longueur ont été installés à 45° depuis l’intérieur des fosses 

permanentes (12 par fosse) et permettent l’observations des racines sur 130 cm en 

dessous de chaque point d’installation en surface, et à 1, 3.5, 5.5, 7.5, 9 .5, 11.5, 13.5, 

15.5 m de profondeur. Sept tubes ont été installés dans la parcelle de référence en 

surface, et à 1 et 3.5 m.   

L’observation des racines est réalisée par acquisition d’images par un scanner 

circulaire (CI-600 Root Growth Monitoring System, CID, USA). Huit images (21.59 cm 

x 19.56 cm) par tube sont prises toutes les deux semaines depuis Mai 2015 : pendant 

1 an avant la coupe des arbres et pendant 2 ans en taillis après la coupe des arbres 



 
 

        
 

en Juin 2016. Les images ont été analysées en utilisant le logiciel WinRHIZO tron 

(Régent, Canada) pour tracer les racines en marquant leur longueur et leur diamètre 

afin d’estimer la croissance au cours du temps. 

Les racines fines, d’un diamètre inférieur à 2 mm, ont été échantillonnées jusqu’à 17m 

de profondeur afin d’estimer la biomasse (racines vivantes) et la nécromasse sur 

l’ensemble du profil de sol à 1.5 an après coupe dans les traitements +W, -W et 7.5 

ans après la plantation dans le traitement NH.  

Les émissions de gaz à la surface du sol ont été mesurées en plaçant une cloche 

(diamètre 40 cm, hauteur 10 cm) sur une base de prélèvement installée sur le site 

expérimental. Quatre chambres ont été placées aléatoirement à quatre distances des 

arbres sur chaque traitement. Les chambres sont fermées pendant 30 min. Une 

aliquote de l’air de la chambre est collecté avec une seringue, à 4 temps consécutifs 

(0, 10 min, 20 min et 30 min) après la fermeture. Les mesures ont été réalisé toutes 

les deux semaines : 3 mois avant la coupe et 1.5 ans après la coupe. Des chambres 

de respiration du sol (9 par traitements et par blocs) ont également été connectées à 

un analyseur Li-Cor 8100 (Li-cor, Lincoln, Ne, USA) permettant le suivi des émissions 

de CO2 à la surface du sol, avec une mesure toutes les deux semaines. Afin de 

collecter régulièrement les gaz du sol, les fosses ont été équipées de micro-enceintes 

installées aux mêmes profondeurs que les minirhizotrons (0.1, 0.5, 1, 3.5, 7.5, 11.5 et 

15.5m), et mesurées deux fois par mois depuis 3 mois avant la coupe jusqu’à 1.5 an 

après la coupe. Les concentrations en gaz sont déterminées par chromatographie en 

phase gazeuse (CPG-ECD). Un modèle de diffusivité a ensuite été utilisé à partir des 

données pour estimer les efflux de CO2, N2O et CH4, ainsi que la production de chaque 

couche de sol à partir des concentrations mesurées dans les fosses. 

Principaux résultats 

Le dispositif de réduction de pluie mis en place a entrainé une forte diminution du 

contenu en eau du sol avec en moyenne une réduction de 12.9% dans -W par rapport 

à +W depuis la surface jusqu’à une profondeur de 16 m. Ce dispositif s’est avéré 

efficace pour étudier deux régimes de précipitations contrastés. Les sols se sont 

rechargés en eau suite à une interruption de la transpiration de la partie aérienne après 

la coupe des arbres. Le contenu en eau du sol était inférieur dans le traitement -W par 



 
 

 
 

rapport au traitement +W avant la coupe, et cette différence a persisté un an et demi 

après la coupe. 

Dans un premier temps, nous nous sommes intéressés à l’impact de la réduction de 

pluie et de la coupe des arbres sur la dynamique racinaire dans une plantation 

d’Eucalyptus menée en taillis. Nos résultats ont montré que le taux journalier 

d’élongation racinaire était fortement dépendant de la couche de sol et de la saison 

dans les traitements +W et -W. En effet après la coupe des arbres, la croissance des 

racines fines a débuté dans les couches superficielles du sol et s’est propagé de plus 

en plus en profondeur au fil du temps dans les deux traitements +W et -W.  Ainsi, après 

la coupe des arbres le démarrage des cohortes racinaires s’est d’abord observé 6 mois 

après la coupe en superficie, 12 mois après la coupe dans la couche 3.5-4.8 m de sol 

et 16 mois après la coupe dans la couche 13.5-14.8 m de sol dans les deux traitements 

+W et -W quand la plantation est menée en taillis. Les valeurs du taux d’élongation 

racinaire journalier ont culminées à la fin de la saison sèche dans toutes les couches 

de sol à des profondeurs supérieures à 6 m, lorsque le contenu en eau du sol était à 

son minimum dans les couches superficielles. Ainsi, les valeurs d’élongation racinaire 

journalières n'étaient pas nécessairement corrélées avec les teneurs en eau du sol 

pour une couche de sol donnée. Nous avons observé une synchronisation entre la 

diminution de la quantité d’eau extractible dans la couche superficielle et les pics 

d’élongations racinaires après la coupe dans le traitement -W. De plus nous avons 

observés que la densité des racines fines chute en dessous de 20 cm de profondeur, 

puis diminue progressivement jusqu’à la nappe phréatique dans les trois traitements 

NH, +W et -W. La biomasse totale des racines fines jusqu'à 17 m de profondeur était 

de 1078 g m-2 dans NH, 1017 ± 301 g m-² dans +W et 1266 ± 363 g m-² dans -W. La 

densité des racines fines était environ 25% plus élevée dans -W que dans +W et NH 

dans la plupart des couches de sol. À des profondeurs supérieures à 7 m, les densités 

de racines fines étaient au moins deux fois plus élevées dans -W que dans + W et NH. 

De plus, nous nous sommes intéressés à l’effet de la réduction de pluie sur l’adaptation 

morphologique des racines fines sur tout le profil de sol. Dans les traitements NH, +W 

et -W, nous avons montrés que la profondeur avait peu d'effet sur la longueur 

spécifique racinaire (SRL), la surface spécifique racinaire (SRA) et le diamètre des 

racines fines. SRL et SRA étaient significativement plus élevés dans -W que dans + 

W, et des valeurs similaires ont été observées dans + W et NH. Sur tout le profil de sol 



 
 

        
 

jusqu’à 17 m de profondeur, les valeurs moyennes de SRL étaient de 28.8, 30.6 et 

34.4 m g-1, les valeurs moyennes de SRA de 258.8, 267.5 et 305.3 cm2 g-1 et les 

diamètres moyens des racines fines de 0.31, 0.32 et 0.36 mm dans les traitements 

NH, +W et -W respectivement. Sur toute la période d’étude (3 ans), la longueur 

cumulée de racines mortes ne représentait que 6-7% de la longueur cumulée de 

racines produite sur tout le profil de sol jusqu’à 17 m de profondeur dans les deux 

traitements +W et -W. Etonnamment, la longueur des racines fines mortes n'a pas 

augmenté après la coupe de la plantation et n'était pas différentes entre les 

profondeurs de sol et entre les traitements +W et -W. 

Ensuite, nous nous sommes intéressés à l’impact de la coupe des arbres et d’une 

réduction de précipitation sur les émissions de gaz à effet de serre ainsi que sur leur 

production/consommation sur tout le profil de sol. Les efflux cumulés de CO2 mesurés 

dans les traitements +W et -W étaient respectivement de 136. 5 ± 21.8 mol m-2 et de 

130.3 ± 24.8 mol m-2 an-1 la dernière année avant la coupe des arbres et de 108.0 ± 

15.8 et de 119.3 ± 22.5 mol m-2 an-1 la première année après la coupe quand la 

plantation est menée en taillis. Nous avons observé aucune différence significative 

entre les cumuls d’émissions de CO2, CH4 et N2O entre les deux traitements +W et -

W. Les efflux de CH4 ont été négatifs pendant toute la période d'étude de mars 2016 

à décembre 2017, indiquant une consommation nette de CH4 atmosphérique par le 

sol. Aucunes différences significatives ont également été observés entre les 

traitements NH et +W sur les émissions de CO2, CH4 et N2O, signifiant que la coupe 

des arbres n’a eu aucun effet.  

Les efflux de CO2, de CH4 et de N2O ne différaient pas significativement entre -W et 

+W et ne changeaient pas après la coupe des arbres dans les peuplements menés en 

taillis par rapport aux peuplements non exploités. Les concentrations de CO2 et de 

CH4 augmentaient fortement avec la profondeur et les concentrations de N2O restaient 

à peu près constantes de la surface du sol jusqu'à une profondeur de 15.5 m. Les 

concentrations moyennes de CO2 et de N2O dans -W étaient respectivement 

inférieures de 20.7% et 7.6% à celles de +W et celles de CH4 dans -W de 44.4% 

supérieures à celles de +W sur tout le profil de sol. Un modèle de diffusivité a montré 

que la production et la consommation de CO2, de N2O et de CH4 se produisaient à de 

grandes profondeurs et étaient similaires dans les traitements +W, -W et NH. La coupe 



 
 

 
 

des arbres n'a pas augmenté les efflux et les productions de CO2, de CH4 et de N2O, 

quel que soit le régime hydrique. 

Les productions de CO2, CH4 et N2O entre 0.1 et 15.5 m de profondeur n'étaient pas 

significativement différentes entre +W et -W. Les estimations de production dans le 

premier mètre de sol ont montré les valeurs les plus élevées de CO2 et de N2O et les 

plus faibles de CH4 en raison d’un fort gradient de concentration et d’une diffusivité 

effective calculée particulièrement élevée pour la couche de sol superficielle. La 

production de CO2 et de N2O et la consommation de CH4 se sont produites 

principalement dans le premier mètre, mais au moins une partie de la production de 

CO2 et de CH4 a atteint une profondeur allant jusqu'à 15.5 m. 

Discussion générale 

Dans cette thèse, nous avons réalisé pour la première fois des mesures in situ de 

phénologie des racines fines et de concentrations de CO2, N2O et CH4 à des 

profondeurs de plus de 10 m dans une plantation d’eucalyptus menée en taillis. Les 

conséquences de la coupe des arbres ainsi qu’une réduction de pluie sur la dynamique 

de production des racines fines et des gaz à effet de serre dans des plantations menée 

en taillis soulèvent des questions spécifiques qui n’ont jamais étudiées auparavant sur 

un profil de sol profond en climat tropical. 

Effet de la réduction de pluie 

Face à une sécheresse induite, les Eucalyptus ont augmenté la densité de leurs 

racines fines en grande profondeur. La croissance des racines dans les couches 

profondes du sol augmente l’espace exploré par les arbres, et peut donc augmenter 

la quantité d'eau disponible nécessaire pour assurer leur croissance. Cet effet pourrait 

constituer un avantage essentiel pour les arbres en cas de sécheresse intense 

(CHRISTINA et al., 2017). Après la coupe, une croissance racinaire spectaculaire a 

été observé à plus de 4 m de profondeur à la fin de la saison sèche, peu importe le 

traitement. La croissance des racines fines dans les couches profondes du sol a 

commencé lorsque la teneur en eau dans la couche de sol de 0-2 m est tombée en 

dessous d'un seuil d'environ 80 mm, ce qui suggère que la teneur en eau du sol dans 

une couche de sol particulière n'était pas le principal facteur responsable de la 

croissance des racines fines. Les flushs successifs de croissance des racines de la 



 
 

        
 

couche superficielle jusqu'aux couches les plus profondes du sol à la fin de la saison 

sèche et dans les premiers mois qui ont suivi le début de la saison des pluies dans les 

traitements + W et -W seraient dus à un épuisement rapide des ressources en eau de 

la couche superficielle, qui induirait les racines des arbres à s’enfoncer plus 

profondément dans le sol (BILLINGS, 2015; SCHENK E JACKSON, 2002). 

De plus nous avons montré que les eucalyptus confrontés à la sécheresse ont adapté 

leur morphologie racinaire afin de maximiser la surface racinaire en contact avec le sol 

pour absorber les ressources limitées. Les valeurs de SRL et SRA étaient plus élevées 

dans –W par rapport à +W, ce qui, combiné à des densités de racines fines plus 

élevées, conduirait à un indice de surface racinaire beaucoup plus élevé. Notre étude 

a montré que les eucalyptus peuvent modifier les traits des racines fines pour améliorer 

la capture des ressources et l'exploration de couches de sol très profondes afin de 

survivre dans un contexte de changement climatique en contribuant au maintien de 

l'absorption d'eau pendant les périodes sèches (BRUNNER et al., 2015; CHRISTINA 

et al., 2017). 

De plus, l'exclusion de pluie n’a eu aucun effet sur les efflux de CO2, N2O et CH4 

mesurés à la surface ou calculés en profondeur avec le modèle de diffusivité. Les 

différences de concentration de gaz dans le sol, mesurées entre +W et –W proviennent 

probablement de la teneur plus élevée en eau dans le sol en +W, ce qui pourrait par 

la suite réduire la diffusivité des gaz du sol alors que les émissions n’ont pas été 

affectés. Dans le traitement +W, la teneur élevée en eau dans le profil de sol pourrait 

induire une saturation de l'espace interstitiel par l’eau et entraîner une lente diffusion 

des gaz à effet de serre vers l'atmosphère (MAIER et al., 2017; WANG et al., 2018). 

La structure des pores et des agrégats du sol est directement liée à la libération de 

gaz à effet de serre mais également au stockage de carbone (MANGALASSERY et 

al., 2013; SMITH et al., 2004). 

La production de CO2, de CH4 et de N2O n'était pas significativement différente entre 

les traitements +W et -W jusqu'à une profondeur de 15.5 m. Cependant, nous avons 

observé que la production peut diminuer dans les couches supérieures et augmenter 

dans les couches profondes. Nous avons montré que la biomasse racinaire ainsi que 

l’indice de surface racinaire augmentaient d'environ 25% et 24% respectivement dans 

le traitement d'exclusion de pluie par rapport à la parcelle témoin jusqu'à une 



 
 

 
 

profondeur de 17 m, et que la biomasse racinaire augmentait principalement à des 

profondeurs supérieures à 7 m. Par conséquent, le déplacement de la production de 

CO2 vers la couche plus profonde observé dans notre étude pourrait être dû à un 

déplacement de l'activité racinaire vers les horizons plus profond, indiquant une 

augmentation de l'absorption d'eau par les racines profondes (SCHWENDENMANN 

et al., 2010; SOTTA et al., 2007). 

Nous avons également observé un déplacement de la consommation de CH4 vers les 

couches profondes du traitement d’exclusion de pluie. Le déplacement de la 

consommation de CH4 vers les couches plus profondes pourrait être dû à des 

conditions de sol plus favorables à la méthanotrophie mais défavorable à la 

méthanogénèse. Des études complémentaires sont nécessaires pour évaluer les 

effets de l’exclusion de pluie sur les communautés microbiennes, leur activité ainsi que 

leurs interactions, en particulier dans les couches profondes du sol. 

Effet de la coupe des arbres 

Nous avons mis en évidence que relativement peu de racines ont été perdues par 

mortalité, avec moins de 10% de mortalité sur toutes les racines observées sur 3 ans, 

ce qui suggère que la plus grande partie du système racinaire reste fonctionnelle après 

la coupe des arbres quand la plantation est menée en taillis. Notre étude suggère que 

les Eucalyptus grandis âgés de 6 ans disposent de réserves suffisantes dans le 

système racinaire pour maintenir la biomasse racinaire établie jusqu'à la nappe 

phréatique après la coupe, ce qui a probablement contribué à la croissance précoce 

des rejets (BRUNNER et al., 2015; DRAKE et al., 2013). 

L'asynchronisme au sein du système racinaire, retardant la croissance des racines 

dans les couches profondes du sol, pourrait être une stratégie employée pour 

maximiser l'absorption d'eau et de nutriments nécessaire pour répondre à la forte 

demande de ces arbres à croissance rapide. La croissance des racines s'est produite 

à une profondeur de 14 m moins d'un an après la coupe des arbres quand ils sont 

menés en taillis, tandis que la profondeur maximale atteinte par les racines de E. 

grandis est d'environ 7 m un an après la plantation dans des sols très profonds 

(CHRISTINA et al., 2017; LACLAU et al., 2013). Les racines profondes permettent un 

accès à de grandes quantités d'eau stockées dans le sous-sol après la coupe et 

malgré la faible densité de racines fines dans les couches profondes du sol, elles 



 
 

        
 

suffisent à absorber des quantités importantes d'eau (CHRISTINA et al., 2017). Les 

faibles taux de mortalité des racines fines après la coupe suggèrent que la gestion en 

taillis des plantations d’Eucalyptus peut être une option prometteuse pour faire face à 

la sécheresse, étant donné que le système racinaire préexistant permet un accès à 

l’eau stockée dans les horizons profonds. 

Contrairement à ce que nous espérions, la coupe des arbres n'a pas entraîné 

d'augmentation des émissions et de la production de CO2, de CH4 et de N2O, quel que 

soit le régime hydrique. La récolte de la biomasse aérienne entraîne une réduction de 

l'absorption de carbone par la photosynthèse immédiatement après la coupe, mais 

également des modifications substantielles de l'environnement physique du sol, telles 

qu'une augmentation de la température (SMETHURST E NAMBIAR, 1990) et de 

l'humidité (CORTINA E VALLEJO, 1994), qui influencent les processus de 

décomposition. En effet, nous avons montré que la coupe des arbres n'entraînait pas 

d'augmentation de la mortalité racinaire la première année après la coupe lorsque la 

plantation était menée en taillis. Par conséquent, nous supposons que la 

décomposition des racines mortes ne s’est pas accélérée après la coupe. Nous 

pouvons supposer que la diminution de la respiration des racines après la coupe, 

associée à l’augmentation de la décomposition des litières à la surface du sol se 

compensent, entraînant des émissions similaires à celles d’avant la coupe. 

Conclusion générale 

La phénologie des racines fines d'eucalyptus menée en taillis soumis à des régimes 

hydriques contrastés a révélé des taux de mortalité très faible. La croissance précoce 

des pousses après la coupe des arbres a bénéficié du système racinaire établi au 

cours de la rotation précédente, et l'asynchronisme de la croissance des racines fines 

en fonction de la profondeur a mis en évidence la plasticité des arbres en réponse aux 

conditions du sol. La mise en place de systèmes racinaires profonds dans les forêts 

tropicales plantées pourrait aider les arbres à résister aux longues périodes de 

sécheresse attendues dans de nombreuses régions tropicales dans un contexte de 

changement climatique.  

De plus, nous avons montré que la coupe des arbres n’entraine pas de manière 

significative l’augmentation des émissions de CO2 et de CH4 quand la plantation est 

menée en taillis par rapport à une plantation non exploitée. Les émissions de gaz après 



 
 

 
 

la coupe sont cohérentes avec les faibles taux de mortalité racinaire observés. D'autre 

part, les racines profondes pourraient également contribuer à la séquestration de 

grandes quantités de C dans le sol. Les allocations de carbone vers les parties 

souterraines représentent environ 20 à 30% de la productivité primaire brute dans les 

plantations d’Eucalyptus (EPRON et al., 2012; NOUVELLON et al., 2012; RYAN et al., 

2010). Le C des racines est généralement retenu plus longtemps dans le sol que celui 

de la litière aérienne, qui est davantage affectée par les processus physico-chimiques 

et qui comporte une composition structurelle différente (MENICHETTI et al., 2015; 

RASSE et al., 2005; SCHMIDT et al., 2011). Des études complémentaires sont 

nécessaires pour déterminer si la gestion des plantations d’eucalyptus dans des sols 

très profonds pourrait constituer une option efficace pour atténuer l’augmentation du 

CO2 dans l’atmosphère et augmenter le stockage du C. 

Les sols tropicaux très profonds couvrent de vastes régions du monde et il est essentiel 

d'améliorer notre compréhension de la dynamique spatio-temporelle des 

concentrations de gaz dans les couches profondes du sol afin de quantifier plus 

précisément les sources / puits de C pour estimer le budget global du carbone, 

améliorer les modèles biogéochimiques actuels pour la prédiction des émissions de 

gaz à effet de serre, et identifier des pratiques sylvicoles plus durables pour les forêts 

tropicales plantées dans le contexte des changements climatiques.

GENERAL INTRODUCTION 

Many studies have been carried out other the last decades to help facing future 

dramatic climatic and demographic changes (ALEXANDRATOS, 1999; CASSMAN, 

1999; VOGT et al., 1995). The research work of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel 

on Climate Change), created in 1988, highlights the impact of climate change, mainly 

anthropogenic, on ecosystems (METZ et al., 2007). The Kyoto treaty was signed in 

1997 to fight against the increase in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse 

gases. The increase of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases (GHG) 

contents in the atmosphere, mainly methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), and their 

role in global warming are undeniable (GRAEFE et al., 2008; SOLOMON et al., 2009). 

Reducing those emissions to avoid a temperature increase of more than 2°C above 

pre-industrial era is a real challenge recognized by the entire scientific community 

(IPCC, 2014). In this perspective, the emission of greenhouse gases into the 

atmosphere can be directly reduced (or offset) by the sequestration of carbon in some 

compartments participating in its cycle. Soil represents the largest reservoir of 

continental organic carbon (JACOBSON et al., 2000). It is estimated that soil sequester 

approximately 800 Gt over the first 30 cm and about 1500 Gt when considering the 

first meter (BATJES, 1996; ESWARAN et al., 1993; POST et al., 1982). Therefore, a 

tiny variation of those stocks can have a strong effect on the global atmospheric 

carbon. In this context, the French Minister of Agriculture launched the “4 per 1000” 

initiative whose objective is to develop agronomic research in order to increase soil 

organic carbon stocks by 4‰ per year. Such an increase would make it possible to 

offset greenhouse gases emissions and mitigate climate change (CHABBI et al., 2017; 

CORBEELS et al., 2019; DIGNAC et al., 2017; LAL, 2016; MINASNY et al., 2017).  

Agriculture is the first source of greenhouse gas emissions (FAO, 2015) when 

combined with land-use change and forestry, which both represent approximately 

17.4% of worldwide GHG emissions. While many studies have been carried out to 

estimate the carbon balance in boreal and temperate forests (BALDOCCHI et al., 

2005; FALGE et al., 2002), comprehensive studies quantifying the main fluxes of the 

C cycle are scarce in tropical forest ecosystems. More study cases accounting for the 

interactive effects of (future) climate, soil, and management practices are needed in 

tropical regions to improve global biogeochemical models (PENUELAS et al., 2013). 



52 
 

 
 

Hence, it is important to assess the feasibility, timeliness, and effectiveness of a 

potential use of planted forests as a strategy to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. 

Forest plantations 

The area of forest plantations has increased sharply in recent decades in response to 

the increase in global demand for timber, mainly as a result of population growth, rising 

living standards, and the emergence of new markets for wood products, such as the 

use of wood as a substitute for fossil fuels (e.g. iron and steel industry). A study based 

on the Global Forest Products Model (BUONGIORNO et al., 2003) predicts a 20% 

increase in world demand for wood by 2060, mainly driven by the increasing 

consumption of paper and wood for buildings (ELIAS E BOUCHER, 2014). While 

natural forests areas decreased from 3961 million hectares in 1990 to 3721 million 

hectares in 2015, forest plantation areas increased from 168 to 278 million hectares 

during the same period (KEENAN et al., 2015; PAYN et al., 2015). Thus, forest 

plantations account for 7% of the total of forest area in the world in 2015, compared to 

4.1% in 1990. In 2000, they accounted for 5% of the global forest cover but provided 

33% of roundwood harvested and reached 46% in 2012, with large disparities between 

regions in the world: 65% in tropical and subtropical regions, 45% in temperate regions 

and only 14% in boreal regions. In tropical and subtropical regions, plantations of fast-

growing species (mainly Eucalyptus, Pinus and Acacia genera) store large amounts of 

carbon and contribute to reducing the exploitation of natural forests by providing an 

increasing proportion of the global demand of wood (KEENAN et al., 2015), and 

accounted for 29% of global forest plantation areas (PAYN et al., 2015). Highest 

productivities are reached in tropical and subtropical regions. Plantation productivity is 

on average 4.6 m3 ha-1 year-1 and greatly vary around the world from 1.4 m3 ha-1 year-

1 on average in boreal regions to 8.4 m3 ha-1 year-1 in tropical regions (PAYN et al., 

2015). South America with an average productivity of 24 m3 ha-1 year-1 is the area with 

the highest productivity. Indeed, in 2012, Brazil’s forest plantations, despite an area of 

only 7.7 million hectares, produced 132 million m3, as much as the United States with 

an area of 79 million hectares that produced 141 million m3. 

 

 



53 
 

        
 

Eucalyptus plantations 

Fast-growing Eucalyptus plantations cover about 20 million hectares throughout the 

world (BOOTH, 2013) and are the most planted tree species in Brazil with about 5.6 

million hectares, which represents 72.3% of the area of Brazilian forest plantations and 

81% of the Brazilian wood production (IBA, 2016). Eucalyptus plantations play an 

important role in the supply of pulp, paper and power generation in Brazil, accounting 

for 5% of the country's GDP, in addition to 2.4 million direct and indirect jobs (IBA, 

2016). These forests of great economic interest have a mean annual increment of 40 

m3 ha-1 year-1 on rotations of 6-8 years, ranging between 25 and 60 m3 ha-1 year-1 

depending on forest management practices and regions (OLIVEIRA et al., 1999). With 

a gross primary productivity that can exceed 3500 g C m-2 year-1 (NOUVELLON et al., 

2012; RYAN et al., 2010), Eucalyptus plantations in Brazil are among the most 

productive forests in the world (LUYSSAERT et al., 2007). The significant productivity 

gains over the last 25 years, from 25 m3 ha-1 year-1 in the early 1990s to more than 40 

m3 ha-1 year-1 nowadays, resulted from improvements in silvicultural practices and 

breeding programs making it possible to identify highly performant clones from some 

Eucalyptus species and hybrids, in particular E. grandis, E. urophylla, E. saligna and 

E. camaldulensis. The diversity of Eucalyptus species planted in tropical regions has 

led to a wide range of products and management practices (GONÇALVES et al., 2013). 

Although many Eucalyptus plantations are intensively managed to produce raw 

materials for industry (mainly pulp and paper, but also solid-wood products, fiberboards 

and charcoal for steel production), energy production from wood for domestic use also 

contributes to alleviating poverty in developing countries (COSSALTER E PYE-SMITH, 

2003; NAMBIAR E HARWOOD, 2014). The development of industries that use wood 

as raw materials has generated more attention from researchers to develop new 

techniques oriented towards the increase of productivity and wood quality. Highly 

productive industrial plantations are generally perceived as a threat to biodiversity, 

water resources or soil fertility. The environmental impact of those highly productive 

forest plantations has raised many concerns in recent decades (COSSALTER E PYE-

SMITH, 2003). Nevertheless, the problems associated with these plantations are often 

site-specific, and how they are managed is of paramount importance.

Consequences of climate change on the forest plantations management 

In Brazil, most of Eucalyptus plantations are settled in areas with very deep soils (&gt; 

5m), low soil fertility and prolonged drought periods (GONÇALVES et al., 2013). Even 

if future precipitation distributions are still difficult to predict at the local scale, studies 

have shown that global warming will be associated with an intensification of dry periods 

in many parts of the globe (Figure 2)(SOLOMON et al., 2009), especially in sub-tropical 

areas already subject to severe droughts (MEEHL et al., 2007). A throughfall exclusion 

experiment in the Amazon showed that a decrease in precipitation can have a 

considerable influence on the functioning of forest ecosystems (BRANDO et al., 2008). 

The dynamics of fine roots, litter fall, soil organic matter decomposition and nutrient 

mineralization, as well as soil aeration (affecting the diffusion of gases and microbial 

processes in the soil) are highly sensitive to rainfall (MAIER et al., 2017; VAN 

STRAATEN et al., 2010). In this context, it is important to better understand the factors 



55 
 

        
 

influencing the response of forest ecosystems and their ability to improve their 

adaptation to drought conditions (CHOAT et al., 2012). 

In tropical and subtropical regions, the productivity of intensively-managed Eucalyptus 

plantations is mainly controlled by water availability in the soil (GONÇALVES et al., 

2013; SMETHURST, 2010). The management of fast-growing Eucalyptus plantations 

should be adapted in the future to more frequent drought conditions to avoid tree 

mortality (BATTIE?LACLAU, LACLAU, DOMEC, et al., 2014; WHITE et al., 2009; 

WHITE et al., 2014). The selection of drought-tolerant clones and hybrids will be 

necessary to reduce tree water requirements, as well as a possible adjustment in 

planting density, fertilization regime and rotation duration (BOOTH, 2013). 

Figure 2 - Average forecasts of changes in global rainfall distribution. Rainfall 
variations are expressed as a percentage change in precipitation per degree of 
warming. Predictions are made for decadal precipitation variations from 1900-1950 
as the reference period (SOLOMON et al., 2009). 

  



56 
 

 
 

Furthermore, the main criticism of industrial Eucalyptus plantations is their high-water 

consumption, which can affect the water resources of the regions concerned by large 

areas of afforestation (JACKSON et al., 2005). Soil moisture monitoring down to a 

depth of 10 m in Brazilian eucalypt plantations showed no drainage beyond the root 

system, from the third year after planting onward, even though the annual 

precipitations was relatively high (about 1400 mm year-1) (CHRISTINA et al., 2011; 

LACLAU et al., 2013). Silvicultural management also has a significant impact on the 

water cycle. The clear-cut of the trees allows a recharge of the deep horizons of the 

soil with a rise of several meters of the water table (ALMEIDA et al., 2007; CHRISTINA 

et al., 2017). Improving our understanding of soil water transfers after cutting the trees 

and their impact on the microbial processes involved in C and nutrient cycling is 

important for the management of these planted forests in a context of climate change 

(IPCC, 2014; SHEFFIELD E WOOD, 2008; SOLOMON et al., 2009). 

The importance of fine roots for tree growth 

Being the main organ for water and nutrient uptake by plants, fine roots (diameter ? 2 

mm) play an essential role in plant growth (BRUNNER et al., 2013; HINSINGER, 2001; 

UPSON E BURGESS, 2013). The establishment of a deep root system can be a 

strategy for plant species to adapt to water stress. In poor soils, most of the fertility is 

concentrated in the surface horizon as a result of deposition and decomposition of 

aboveground litter, soil organic matter mineralization and fine root decomposition. The 

high root growth rate of Eucalyptus trees allows them to explore both the superficial 

soil layers and very deep soil horizons at early stages. Fine roots in eucalypt 

plantations can reach a depth of 7 m the first year after planting when there is no barrier 

for root growth (CHRISTINA et al., 2011; LACLAU et al., 2013). However, the relative 

contribution of deep roots to mineral nutrition is still poorly documented in these 

plantations (BORDRON et al., 2018; DA SILVA et al., 2011). 

Plant species use a large range of rooting patterns to cope with periodic drought, from 

“drought tolerant strategies” with fine roots surviving in periodically dry soil, to “drought 

avoiding strategies” shedding fine roots from dry soil horizons while rapidly developing 

roots in moister areas (BRISTIEL et al., 2018; BRUNNER et al., 2015; VRIES et al., 

2016). Drought can increase the root-to-shoot ratio, the root area or root length-to-leaf 

area ratio, as well as the proportion of fine roots in deep soil layers and/or the specific 



57 
 

        
 

root area (MA et al., 2018; MARKESTEIJN E POORTER, 2009; ZHOU et al., 2018). 

Root growth peaks have been shown in deep soil layers during or the first months just 

after dry periods for eucalypt and rubber trees in tropical soils (LAMBAIS et al., 2017; 

MAEGHT et al., 2015). Drought tolerance strategies are common for herbaceous 

plants, while drought avoiding strategies are often adopted by trees in evergreen 

tropical forests (BRUNNER et al., 2015). Despite the crucial role of fine roots to cope 

with drought, root phenology remains poorly understood in comparison to leaf 

ecophysiology (RADVILLE et al., 2016). 

Fine root dynamics and turnover depend on the plant species, but also on biotic and 

abiotic parameters. For example, soil water contents and soil properties, such as pH, 

nitrogen and oxygen concentrations can strongly influence fine root dynamics (GUO et 

al., 2008; SATOMURA et al., 2007; VOGT et al., 1995). Indeed, observations in 

Eucalyptus plantations suggest a link between the vertical distribution of fine roots and 

nutrient acquisition by the trees (BOUILLET et al., 2002; DA SILVA et al., 2011; 

LACLAU et al., 2013), which can itself develop a high plasticity of its root system to 

colonize preferentially nutrient-rich areas (HODGE, 2004). 

How to study fine root dynamics 

There is no consensus on the best method to measure fine root production in forest 

ecosystems, and most studies conclude that a combination of different methods gives 

the most reliable results (HENDRICKS et al., 2006; HERTEL E LEUSCHNER, 2002; 

JOURDAN et al., 2008; VOGT et al., 1995). Successive soil sampling with a sequential 

coring measurement is the most commonly used method to study fine root production 

in natural or planted forest ecosystems (JOURDAN et al., 2008; MELLO et al., 2007; 

PERSSON, 1978). It is frequently associated with the installation of “ingrowth cores”, 

both techniques are based on destructive soil samplings. In the last method, new fine 

roots produced in a root-free soil volume are regularly collected and quantified within 

mesh bags every month or more, during an entire year, to estimate the annual fine root 

production (HENDRICKS et al., 2006). However, several studies have shown that soil 

disturbances (in particular fine root cutting) that occurred during the installation of the 

mesh bags significantly changes fine root dynamics (HERTEL E LEUSCHNER, 2002; 

JOURDAN et al., 2008; VOGT et al., 1998). Since the 1980s, the minirhizotron 

technique is widely used to study fine root dynamics and turnover (GRAEFE et al., 



58 
 

 
 

2008; MAEGHT et al., 2013; WITHINGTON et al., 2003). This technique allows direct 

observation and measurement of fine root dynamics while minimizing soil disturbance 

if a long period of recovery is observed prior to root measurements. It is a non-

destructive method that involves the installation of transparent tubes, called 

minirhizotrons, in the soil near the studied plants (MAJDI et al., 2001; TIERNEY E 

FAHEY, 2001; WITHINGTON et al., 2003). With this transparent interface, fine roots 

can be measured at successive dates to study the dynamics of growth and mortality 

(ANDERSON et al., 2003; HENDRICK E PREGITZER, 1996). The opportunity to study 

fine roots in a mildly disturbed environment is an important asset of this method (MAJDI 

et al., 2001). 

Specificities of fine roots in deep soil layers 

Deep fine roots are fundamental organs for the growth and survival of plants. They 

help to avoid nutrient losses through deep drainage (LACLAU et al., 2010; 

MARESCHAL et al., 2013), and to withdraw water at great depth during dry periods 

(BATTIE?LACLAU, LACLAU, DOMEC, et al., 2014; CHRISTINA et al., 2015; 

SCHWENDENMANN et al., 2010). Fine root dynamics at the vicinity of very deep water 

tables have been little studied (SOYLU et al., 2014), mainly due to technical difficulties, 

although the fine root behavior can be essential for plant survival during severe drought 

events (IVANOV et al., 2012; MALHI et al., 2009; MARKEWITZ et al., 2010; NEPSTAD 

et al., 2007). Fine root lifespan depends on many factors such as root order (GUO et 

al., 2008), diameter (JOSLIN et al., 2006) and soil depth (BADDELEY E WATSON, 

2005; GERMON et al., 2016; HENDRICK E PREGITZER, 1996). Most of the studies 

dealing with fine root production and turnover have been carried out in the upper soil 

layers (depth&amp;lt;1 m) mainly due to the difficulty to realize such measurements at great 

depth (BILLINGS, 2015). Improving our understanding of water and nutrient uptake 

processes at great depth will become more important for forest management in a 

context of climate change (MALHI et al., 2009; NEPSTAD et al., 1994). 

Studies carried out in Brazil showed that about 10% of the total fine root biomass is 

distributed below 3 m of depth in eucalypt plantations (CHRISTINA et al., 2011). 

LACLAU et al. (2013) showed that the proportion of fine roots below 4 m deep 

increased with the age of Eucalyptus trees: fine roots below 4 m deep represented 5%, 

10% and 20% of the fine root intersects on vertical pit walls in plantations of 1, 3.5 and 



59 
 

        
 

6 years old, respectively. In Brazil, the first estimates of the production and turnover of 

Eucalyptus fine roots were conducted in topsoil horizons limited to a depth of 1 m 

(JOURDAN et al., 2008; MELLO et al., 2007), while little is known about these 

processes at depth. LAMBAIS et al. (2017) studied root production and mortality during 

the first rotation of Eucalyptus plantation down to a depth of 6 m. They showed that 

Eucalyptus fine roots colonized quickly the very deep soil horizons (depth &gt; 5 m) and 

that the root elongation rate was higher between the depths of 5 and 6 m compared to 

the top soil from 2 to 4 years after planting. In addition, there was only 3.4% of root 

length lost by mortality in the 5-6 m soil layer during the 2 years of study, whereas 

22.7% of the fine roots had died in the superficial layer. There is little quantitative data 

on deep fine root dynamics (&gt; 6 m) and literature tends to underestimate the depth of 

the root system distribution as well as its importance in ecosystems functioning and 

productivity (FREYCON et al., 2015; MARKEWITZ et al., 2010; SCHENK E JACKSON, 

2002). 

Relationships between fine root dynamics and GHG fluxes  

Fine roots participate actively in the C fluxes in forest soils through the emission of C 

to atmosphere by respiratory processes and C storage in the soil from root mortality 

and exudation of carbonic compounds (BALESDENT E BALABANE, 1996; STRAND 

et al., 2008). Then, it is challenging to compare the observations of fine root production 

and mortality with the dynamics of CO2, CH4 and N2O throughout deep soil profiles in 

the context of climate change. Eucalyptus trees allocate about 30% of their gross 

primary productivity to root maintenance and production in highly productive 

plantations managed in short rotations (RYAN et al., 2010), but the difficulty to estimate 

fine root dynamics throughout the entire soil profile limits the estimation of the global 

soil carbon cycle and the total emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), as well as the 

understanding of factors controlling them (WANG et al., 2013).  

Greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from soils are the result of complex production, 

consumption and transport processes (Figure 3), and are affected by many factors 

such as microclimate, substrate availability for soil micro-organisms, aboveground 

photosynthetic supply to roots and management factors (METAY et al., 2007). CO2 

effluxes at soil surface come from root respiration, anaerobic and aerobic microbial 

respiration and soil organic matter decomposition (Figure 3) (OERTEL et al., 2016; 



60 
 

 
 

VERSINI et al., 2013). CH4 effluxes depend on the balance between production by 

methanogenesis under anaerobic conditions and consumption by methanotrophic 

microorganisms (DUTAUR E VERCHOT, 2007; TATE, 2015) (Figure 3). N2O 

emissions from soil are driven by microbial nitrification (oxidation of NH4+ to NO3-) 

and denitrification (reduction of NO3- to N2O) (Figure 3) (BAI et al., 2014; ORTIZ-

GONZALO et al., 2018; ZHONG et al., 2014).  

Production of greenhouse gases by soil microorganisms and roots can change rapidly 

temporally and spatially, which makes modeling efforts challenging (COURTOIS et al., 

2018; DREWITT et al., 2005). While most studies dealing with soil greenhouse gas 

effluxes addressed the spatial and temporal variations, the vertical distribution of soil 

respiration is still little documented in very deep soils (DREWITT et al., 2005). Trees 

with roots at depths of more than 10 m are common in tropical forests (BROEDEL et 

al., 2017; NEPSTAD et al., 1994; SALESKA et al., 2007). In a Brazilian Amazon forest, 

the consumption of CH4 occurred mainly in the upper 10 cm of the soil profile, the 

production of N2O mainly in the 0-25 cm soil layer whereas CO2 was produced down 

to at least a soil depth of 11 m (DAVIDSON et al., 2004). In another Amazonian forest, 

CO2 production in the 0.5-3 m soil layer accounted for 17 % of the total soil CO2 

production (SOTTA et al., 2007). Even if microbial activity is low in deep soil layers 

(FONTAINE et al., 2007), the huge soil volume explored by fine roots might lead to 

significant CO2, N2O and CH4 productions within the entire rooting soil profile.  

Measurements of GHG emissions at the soil surface provide an integrative estimate of 

the net production in the soil, but information on the patterns of production, 

consumption and transport of CO2, CH4 and N2O within the soil profile remain poorly 

understood (DAVIDSON et al., 2006; HASHIMOTO et al., 2007; WIAUX et al., 2015). 

Understanding these patterns can provide insights into the possibilities of reducing 

GHG emissions. Data on the time course of GHG concentrations throughout soil 

profiles can provide additional information on heterogeneous gaseous exchange 

processes at depth that may be involved in the control of such surface fluxes. The 

comparison between the dynamics of CO2 contents at various depths and the 

dynamics of production and mortality of fine roots throughout the soil profile observed 

with minirhizotrons could help us to better estimate and characterize the origin of the 

organic C emitted at the soil surface.

Root dynamics in forest stands conducted in coppice 

Coppice management could be an interesting option to face water deficit because the 

trees are likely to benefit from a root system already established preserving living 

biomass for the next generation and making it possible to access the deep soil layers 

where water availability can be higher than in the topsoil. Coppice-managed 

plantations, letting regenerate one or two shoots from the stump after the harvest, are 

common due to lower production costs, shorter cycle times and faster financial returns 

compared to replanting (GONÇALVES et al., 2014). The proportion of coppice-

managed plantations has increased from 10 % of the total area of Eucalyptus 

plantations in 2008 to 25-35% in 2010. The effects of clear-cutting on fine root 

dynamics in coppiced-managed forest plantations are poorly documented and the 

trends are not clear. Sequential coring in Brazilian eucalypt plantations conducted in 

coppice showed that fine root density decreased in the 0-1 m soil layer the first 60 days 

after harvesting while fine root decomposition was accelerated (MELLO et al., 2007). 

Less intense root growth was observed in the first 10 cm of the soil at 90 days after 

cutting the trees. In addition, this study showed that the decomposition of fine roots 

was accelerated after the clear-cut (MELLO et al., 2007). An earlier study suggested 

that the growth of fine roots continues during the period after the harvest of trees in 

coppice-managed plantations of E. camaldulensis Dehn in Morocco; however, radial 

root growth was interrupted after cutting the trees (RIEDACKER, 1973). The most 

complete studies on root dynamics after regrowth have been carried out in coppice-

managed Populus plantations. DICKMANN et al. (1996) observed little changes in fine 

root production and mortality after clear-cutting down to a depth of 1 m. 

BERHONGARAY et al. (2015) showed that before cutting the trees, the mortality of 

fine roots was much lower than the production, while after the harvest, mortality 

exceeded the root production. However, these results were obtained only in the upper 

80 cm of the soil, while studies carried out in eucalypt plantations in the state of São 

Paulo showed that approximately 50% of the roots of diameter&amp;lt;1 mm were located 

below 1 m (LACLAU et al., 2013). Cutting the trees leads to a significant production of 

organic matter via necromass and carbon compound exudates and therefore could be 

considerable at great depth (BERHONGARAY et al., 2015; WERNER E SCHNYDER, 

2012) due to the amount of fine roots produced in these soil depths (LACLAU et al., 

2013).

Root inputs and changes in soil organic matter dynamics in coppice-managed 

stands 

Coppice management may influence carbon sequestration in the superficial soil layers 

in Eucalyptus plantations, but also in very deep soil horizons where the influence of 

fresh organic matter inputs on carbon storage is still poorly understood (DERRIEN et 

al., 2014; FONTAINE et al., 2007). Removing the aboveground parts of trees can have 

a great impact on the ecosystem carbon balance and greenhouses gases emissions. 

Clear-cutting increases the solar radiation transmitted to the soil, raising the soil 

temperature and soil water contents through an interruption of stand transpiration 

(LONDO et al., 1999; MELLO et al., 2007). This may induce an increase in microbial 

activity, the decomposition of harvest residues left at the soil surface and enhance fine 

root mortality and decomposition (MELLO et al., 2007; PARFITT et al., 2001). When 

decomposed, a part of the former tissues from the roots is incorporated into the soil 

organic matter (STRAND et al., 2008). Microorganisms are reactivated in response of 

the input of fresh organic matter. Specialized microorganisms develop rapidly and 

break down fresh organic matter. Their metabolites can activate a second class of 

specialized microorganisms, in dormancy, which can degrade the organic matter 

initially present and stored in the soil: this is the "priming effect" (FONTAINE et al., 

2003). KUZYAKOV et al. (2000) emphasizes the importance of characterizing 

microbial communities, their biomass but also their functioning (e.g. catabolic profile or 

enzymatic activity), and their structure (e.g. bacteria / fungi ratio) as a prerequisite for 

the evaluation of the underlying mechanisms. The consumption of soil organic matter 

by microbes results in the emission of CO2 in aerobic conditions and CH4 in anaerobic 

conditions. The “priming effect” could affect carbon storage in the soil and indirectly 

influence the nitrogen cycle. Indeed, CO2 emissions in the soil profile influence the 

oxygen partial pressure, which is one of the factors controlling the transformation 

reactions of nitrogen substrates in the soil. Furthermore, the availability of carbon 

substrates is one of the main regulatory factors of the denitrification reaction 

(GROFFMAN, 1991). Diffusion and transport of gases are inversely proportional to the 

water-filled pore space (WFPS%). Therefore, when the soil water content decreases, 

CO2, CH4 and N2O reaches the surface quickly, the oxygen diffuses better throughout 

the soil profile, which influences important production and consumption processes 

(CLOUGH et al., 2005; HEINCKE E KAUPENJOHANN, 1999). Most of the studies 



64 
 

 
 

dealing with soil carbon storage and greenhouse gas concentrations are limited to the 

upper meter of the soil profile (HARPER E TIBBETT, 2013). The consequences of tree 

harvesting on root dynamics and greenhouse gases production and consumption over 

the first year of the rotation in coppice-managed plantations ask specific questions 

never studied within the entire rooting profile in deep tropical soils. 

A literature review pointed out the importance of fine roots in deep soil layers for the 

growth and survival of plants and their ability to adapt to biotic and abiotic stresses. 

The foraging strategy adopted by root systems is influenced by water availability, so 

plants tend to develop deeper root systems when they are subject to water stress 

(BRISTIEL et al., 2018; CHRISTINA et al., 2011). Coppice management could be an 

interesting option to face water deficit because the trees are likely to benefit from a 

deep root system already established before harvesting the previous stand to produce 

new shoots. Despite recent insights highlighting the importance of fine roots at great 

depth, current knowledge of their dynamics is still extremely limited. Furthermore, root 

mortality supply organic matter at different soil depths, which is likely to affect 

greenhouse gas production and consumption processes. Therefore, improving our 

understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of GHG concentrations throughout 

deep soil profiles is an important issue to assess the environmental impact of 

silvicultural practices in tropical planted forests in a context of climate change.

Research question and specific objectives 

The evaluation of the contribution of deep fine roots to the spatiotemporal dynamics of 

GHG concentrations throughout deep soil profiles is a metrological challenge and, in 

fact, a major scientific lock. The general objective of the thesis is to gain insight into 

fine root production and mortality in deep soil profiles with a joint characterization of 

greenhouse gases consumption and production. These effects have been monitored 

before and after harvesting all the trees in a highly productive Eucalyptus grandis 

plantation managed in coppice after clear-cutting, under two contrasting water supply 

regimes in São Paulo state, Brazil.  

The specific objectives of the thesis are: 

- To gain insight into the influence of rainfall reduction on fine root production and 

mortality throughout the soil profile in coppice-managed plantations; 

- To assess the effect of clear-cutting and coppice management on fine roots 

dynamics down to the water table, here located at a depth of 17 m;  

- To determine the vertical profile of CO2, CH4, and N2O production rates from the 

topsoil to a depth of 17 m under two contrasting rainfall regimes.

Study site  

To meet our objectives, we used a field trial in a clonal plantation of Eucalyptus grandis 

W. Hill ex Maiden located in the southeastern region of Brazil, in São Paulo state. Very 

simplified forest ecosystems such as monoclonal plantations offer interesting 

opportunities to understand more precisely some ecophysiological and 

biogeochemical processes impacting carbon and nutrient cycling. The studied field trial 

is particularly of interest to answer our questions because Eucalyptus trees exhibit a 

remarkable deep root system in homogeneous tropical soils, and they have the 

capability to be coppice managed.  

Characteristics of the experimental area  

The work presented in this thesis was performed between 2015 and 2017 in Brazil at 

the Itatinga Forest Science Experimental Station owned by the Agricultural Superior 

School of Luiz de Quieroz (ESALQ) of São Paulo State University (USP). This 

experimental station, of an area of 2120 hectares, is located on the western plateau of 

São Paulo (23°02’S 48°38’W) at 300 km from the sea. This experimental site was 

heavily instrumented to quantify the dynamics of C, water and nutrient fluxes and to 

model the functioning of highly productive eucalypt plantations. 

The climate of this region was humid subtropical with a dry winter (Cwa) according to 

the Köppen classification. Over the 15 years prior to this study, the mean annual rainfall 

was 1390 mm, the mean air temperature was 20°C and the mean relative humidity 

was 77%. Two seasons can be distinguished, a dry and cold season from June to 

September with a mean monthly temperature of 15°C, and a wet and hot season from 

October to May, with a mean monthly temperature of 25°C and heavy rainfalls (about 

75% of the total annual rainfall). 

The experiment was located on the upper part of a hill (slope&amp;lt;3%) at an altitude of 

850 m. From 1945 to 1998, the area was planted with Eucalyptus saligna and since 

1998 wooded with a highly productive plantation of Eucalyptus grandis W. Hill ex 

Maiden. E. grandis are native from the east coast of Australia, between latitudes 33°S 

(New South Wales) and 16°S (northern Queensland), in areas where precipitations are 

greater than 1000 m. In Brazil, the Eucalyptus grandis species is widely used due to 



68 
 

 
 

the high quality of pulpwood, rapid growth and high productivity, and its suitability for 

coppice-management. 

The soils were very deep (&gt; 15 m) Ferralsols (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015) 

developed on Cretaceous sandstone of medium texture. Clay contents were ranging 

from 160 mg g-1 in the topsoil to about 250 mg g-1 at a depth of 15 m. Soil mineralogy 

is dominated by quartz, kaolinite and oxyhydroxides. MAQUERE (2008) characterized 

in detail the soil chemical attributes down to a soil depth of 6 m (Table 2).

Experimental Layout 

Changing water availabilities is an important issue in a context of global change as the 

continuing rise in atmospheric CO2 levels may come along increased variability in 

rainfall distribution in many regions. A split-plot experimental design was set up in June 

2010 with a Eucalyptus grandis clone used in commercial plantation by the Suzano 

Company (São Paulo, Brazil), to evaluate the impact of rainfall reduction and 

contrasting fertilizations on the productivity and adaptability of Eucalyptus plantations. 

The experimental layout contained six treatments (three types of nutrient supply x two 

water regimes) replicated in three blocks. The whole-plot factor was the water supply 

regime (‘‘exclusion” plots, -W, vs ‘‘non-exclusion” plots, +W) and the split-plot factor 

was the fertilization regime. In this thesis, we studied two treatments out of all those 

available in the experimental design: one treatment with undisturbed rainfall (+W) and 



69 
 

        
 

one treatment with throughfall exclusion (-W). Treatments -W and +W were used to 

determine the water deficit effect. 

The individual plots area was about 864 m2. Trees were planted in June 2010 at a 

spacing of 3 m x 2 m with a stocking density of 1666 trees per hectare, e.g. 144 trees 

per plot totalizing 432 trees per treatment per 3 blocks. All the plots were fertilized at 

planting with 3.3 g P m-2, 200 g m-2 of dolomitic lime and trace elements, and at 3 

months of age 12 g N m-2 and 0.45 mol K m-2 were applied as KCl. Field trials at the 

study site and in nearby areas on the same type of soil showed that the amounts of N, 

P, Ca, Mg and micronutrients applied in this experiment were not limiting for tree 

growth (GONÇALVES et al., 2007; LACLAU et al., 2009). Herbicides were applied to 

avoid the presence of understory species. 

Since September 2010, throughfall was partially excluded in -W plots, using panels 

made of clear greenhouse plastic sheets mounted on wooden frames at heights 

ranging between 0.5 m and 1.6 m. Plastic sheets covered 37% of the area in the -W 

plots. A 50 cm deep trench was dug around the -W plots to limit the lateral development 

of Eucalyptus roots between + W and -W treatments. The dead leaves, branches and 

bark that fell on the plastic sheets were collected weekly and scattered under the 

gutters during the entire study. Water excluded from the gutters was collected weekly 

and samples were analyzed monthly to estimate the amounts of nutrients excluded 

during the study period. These amounts of dissolved nutrients in the water were 

replaced each year in each -W treatment (ammonium sulphate, KCl, NaCl, phosphorus 

...) to distinguish the effect of water exclusion and nutrient deficiency.

of Brazil, at the Itatinga Forest Science Experimental Station in São Paulo state.  

 

In +W and -W, the eucalypt stands were harvested six years after planting, in June 

2016, and the plantation was coppice-managed thereafter. Several new shoots were 

regenerated from the stumps after the clear-cut and 1 or 2 shoots per stump were 

selected to maintain the same stocking density and prevent the growth of additional 

new shoots. A third treatment served as a control, with undisturbed rainfall and no 

harvest (NH), to assess the clear-cutting effect. 

Two deep permanent pits were excavated in +W and -W to gain access to the complete 

soil profile from the top soil down to the water table. A third pit was excavated in the 

non-harvested treatment (NH) down to 3.5 m to determine the clear-cut effect.  

Root dynamics were studied using minirhizotron over 1 year before clear-cutting, then 

over 2 years in coppice, as well as in the non-harvested plot (NH) serving as a control, 

and fine roots (i.e. diameter &amp;lt;2 mm) were sampled down to 17 m in +W, -W and NH. 

More complete descriptions of the methods used as well as the results obtained are 

presented in Chapter 2 « Consequences of clear-cutting and drought on fine root 

dynamics down to 17 m in coppice-managed eucalypt plantations »

CO2, CH4 and N2O surface effluxes at soil surface were measured over three years 

using the closed-chamber method in -W, +W and NH. CO2, CH4 and N2O 

concentrations in the soil were measured from two permanent pits down to a depth of 

15.5 m in -W and +W, as well as down to a depth of 4 m in NH. Measurements were 

carried out every 2 weeks over 3 months before clear-cutting, then over 19 months in 

coppice. More complete descriptions of the methods used as well as the results 

obtained are presented in Chapter 3 « Consequences of clear-cutting and drought on 

CO2, CH4 and N2O productions throughout deep soil profiles in coppice-managed

Summary of the previous works in this field trial (supplementary information) 

Joint monitoring on this site of the main carbon fluxes (soil surface effluxes, 

aboveground and belowground biomass, litter fall, photosynthesis and leaf-level 

respiration, LAI), water (water balance in the soil, sap flow) and nutrients (accumulation 

in the trees and litter, dissolved fluxes in gravitational solutions) provided important 

advances in understanding the environmental control of biogeochemical cycles. 

This experiment was highly instrumented with soil moisture measurements (down to 

17 m depth), groundwater level (which varies around 17 m depth), soil temperature, 

growth radial (dendrometric ribbons), circumference and height, leaf potential, stomatal 

conductance, photosynthesis, leaf area index, trunk respiration, concentrations of 

sugars and minerals in the phloem, mineral concentrations at different depths in the 

soil solutions, litterfall, soil respiration, carbon allocation, root distribution down to the 

root front, root surfaces and sapwood surfaces… 

Previous studies in this experimental set up studied the effect of K deficiency and/or 

Na deficiency and/or water deficit on cell and leaf expansion i.e. foliar concentration of 

nutrients, polyols and soluble sugars, leaf water parameters and leaf anatomy 

(BATTIE-LACLAU et al., 2013)  stomata structural and physiological adjustments 

(BATTIE?LACLAU, LACLAU, DOMEC, et al., 2014), gross primary production, light use 

efficiency for carbon assimilation and absorbed radiation as the main parameters 

accounting for the changes (CHRISTINA et al., 2015), photosynthetic physiology 

(BATTIE?LACLAU, LACLAU, BERI, et al., 2014), phloem transport of photosynthates 

(EPRON et al., 2015), wood formation (PLOYET et al., 2019),  water use efficiency 

(BATTIE-LACLAU et al., 2016), tree water use and water seepage (CHRISTINA et al., 

2018), canopy conductance, sapwood area: leaf area ratio (Huber value) and sap flow 

driving force (ASENSIO et al., 2019) and deep root functioning through rhizosphere 

versus bulk soil analysis (PRADIER et al., 2017). The incorporation of these results in 

process-based models, as well as further studies dealing with long-term effect of water 

availability on soil properties might contribute to evaluate adaptive changes induced 

by global changes in tropical Eucalyptus plantations. 

K deficiency and water deficit affect traits involved in catching light resources, traits 

controlling CO2 assimilation, traits related to transport via xylem and phloem and soil 

water and nutrient resources (Table 3). Indeed, K fertilization through drastic 



74 
 

 
 

modifications in leaves physiology greatly increased gross primary productivity and 

above ground biomass production. A modeling approach revealed that soil water 

uptake parameters and leaf photosynthetic parameters were the main drivers of gross 

primary productivity and light-use efficiency for carbon assimilation. Photosynthesis, 

anatomical and biochemical leaf treats in E. grandis had a functional relationship 

between K and Na supply. Osmotic adjustment, stomatal closure, higher phloem sugar 

concentration, higher velocity of C transfer in phloem and a decrease in leaf area index 

were observed when trees were subjected to water restriction and K deficiency. K 

fertilization and water availability modified xylem metabolome and transcriptome and 

impacts greatly wood structure, and notably vessel properties. Water deficiency also 

increased the mean soil depth of water withdrawal, decreased the residual soil water 

content in deep soil layers and lead to a drop in the water table.  

Furthermore, reduced rainfall significantly increase exchangeable K and H3O+ within 

the rhizosphere and enhanced at great depth. A complementary study showed for the 

first-time ectomycorrhizal symbiosis in deep soil layers and the population of Pisolithus 

sp., the dominated genus, was strongly dependent on soil depth (ROBIN et al., 2019). 

Those results combined suggest a different root functioning in response to drought 

condition and especially in deep soil layers.  

However, the influence of nutrient and water availability on root traits and root 

dynamics at depth remains poorly known despite its role in: i) microclimate, ii) tree 

growth during drought periods, iii) the potential for carbon sequestration in the deep 

layers of tropical soils, iv) the recycling of nutrients. Improving the understanding of the 

environmental control of rooting strategies in trees is of interest beyond the scope of 

Eucalyptus plantations in Brazil. Furthermore, the huge soil volume explored by fine 

roots might lead to significant CO2, N2O and CH4 productions, and improving our 

understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of gas concentrations in deep soil layers 

is essential to quantify more accurately C source/sink fluxes in tropical soils. 

Comprehensive experimental studies are needed to improve the current 

biogeochemical models used to predict the effect of drought periods on greenhouse 

gas effluxes.

CHAPTER 1 - DEEP FINE ROOT DYNAMICS IN FOREST ECOSYSTEMS: 

WHY DIGGING DEEPER? 

Abstract  

Deep fine roots have been recently defined as fine roots encountered below a depth 

of 1 m and represent a large part of tree root system. While knowledge on deep root 

dynamics is constantly expending, our understanding of the phenology, morphology, 

anatomy and role of deep fine roots is still largely incomplete. In this review, the current 

knowledge about fine root production, mortality and longevity in deep soil layers, and 

the magnitude of the impacts and significance of deep fine root on carbon and nutrient 

cycling were discussed and highlighted. Deep fine roots are highly plastic in response 

to environmental conditions and soil resources. They present contrasting functional 

traits and functional specializations compared to shallow roots and are mainly oriented 

toward water acquisition and transport. Deep roots have a large impact on plant 

development and biogeochemical cycles through water and nutrient uptake, carbon 

allocation and sequestration in the soil. Therefore, modeling processes need to 

consider deep root functioning and dynamics accurately to better estimate net 

ecosystem productivity and nutrients, carbon and water cycles.  

 

Key words: fine root growth, root traits, root longevity, root production, root mortality, 

carbon sequestration, tree plantations

1. 1 Introduction 

Roots are plant's underground organs responsible for anchorage in the soil and 

absorption of water and nutrients needed for plant development. The anchorage 

function is provided by the largest roots and mainly involves physical interactions 

between roots and the soil. The absorptive function is more complex as it involves 

biogeochemical, biochemical and biological interactions between fine roots, soil, but 

also soil microorganism. Roots develop often symbiosis with soil bacteria and fungi. 

Fine roots have the ability to adapt to different environments to facilitate the 

development of the plant. Fine roots link plant metabolism to soil nutrient cycles, they 

are ephemeral and frequently replaced. They can modify the physical, chemical and 

biotic soil properties by their activities which can have repercussions not only at the 

plant scale but also at the ecosystem level (McCormack et al., 2015). Indeed, fine roots 

play a major role in the global carbon (C) cycle, representing significant C input into 

the soil by the incorporation of exudates and root necromass, and generating a return 

of C to the atmosphere through respiration and decomposition processes (Balesdent 

and Balabane, 1996; Strand et al., 2008). Root systems are known to be very 

heterogeneous and plastic, both architecturally and functionally, depending on plant 

age and its phenology, soil conditions and climate (Hodge et al., 2009). Roots have 

the capacity to expand over large soil volume, particularly with shrubs and trees, and 

can be found at very great depths in xeric and drought ecosystems (Canadell et al., 

1996; Schenk and Jackson, 2002).  

Fine root dynamics are defined as fine root production and mortality (Hendrick and 

Pregitzer, 1993; McCormack and Guo, 2014), finer root turnover and survivorship 

(Anderson et al., 2003), senescence (Huck et al., 1987) and fine root elongation rate 

(Germon et al., 2016; Lambais et al., 2017). Fine root dynamics are driven by both 

endogenous and exogenous factors like soil temperature and water content (Coll et 

al., 2012), hormones (McAdam et al., 2016), photosynthate and nutrient availability 

(Tierney and Fahey, 2002; Sloan et al., 2016), which may be considerably 

heterogeneous along the soil profile (Figure 1). However, deep fine root dynamics, 

functional significance and contribution to the water cycles and biogeochemistry 

processes at plant and ecosystem scale, are still poorly known. The objective of this 

study is to provide an up-to-date literature review on deep fine roots through their root 

traits, morphology and phenology, and through the biotic and abiotic interactions with 



79 
 

        
 

the soil environment. Previous studies on deep fine root production, mortality and 

longevity, belowground C sequestration, symbiosis with mycorrhizae, and nutrient 

uptake will be reviewed more specifically.

fine-root dynamics (according to Coleman et al. 2018). The width of the pyramid and 
shading reflects the relative magnitude of each factor. As the width narrows and 
shading decreases, the magnitude of the response decreases. 

1. 2 Defining deep fine roots 

The importance of deep root system has been highlighted in several reviews (Canadell 

et al., 1996; Maeght et al., 2013; Pierret et al., 2016) , but their dynamics and 

specificities are still poorly known. Numerous rooting depth characteristics have been 

examined since those studies, yet studies often claim that physiological and 

morphological characteristics of deep root systems are poorly understood. Recently 

defined by Maeght et al. (2013), deep roots are roots growing below a depth of 1 m. 

More and more studies highlight that rooting depth has been underestimated, 

particularly for shrubs and trees (Canadell et al., 1996). Even if a small number of roots 

are found at great depth, deep roots likely have a key role in many processes of plant 

physiology, community ecology and geochemical cycles. Studies have demonstrated 

that deep roots are found in many biomes, where drought conditions are commonly 

exhibited (Nepstad et al., 1994; Canadell et al., 1996; Jackson et al., 2000; Schenk 

and Jackson, 2002), but maximum rooting depth reported in the scientific literature is 

underestimated because few studies have focused on deeper horizons (Schenk and 



80 
 

 
 

Jackson, 2002) and have artificially truncated the root distribution. Stone and Kalisz 

(1991) reported 37 examples of tree root colonization between 10 and 60 m below the 

soil surface, indicating that the maximum rooting depth varies considerably with 

climatic and soil conditions and between species. Canadell et al. (1996) reviewed that 

roots under different vegetation systems extend in deep horizons down to 9.5±2.4 m 

in deserts, 7.3±2.8 m in tropical evergreen forest and 15.0±5.4 m in tropical grassland 

and savannah, with maximum rooting depths of 68 m for Eucalyptus trees.  

Once that considerable rooting depth has been highlighted, deep root distribution and 

dynamics need to be better described as it is still poorly studied compared to shallow 

root distribution. Indeed, deep root studies are scarce despite the recent technical 

advances and innovations because it is still difficult to access, time-consuming, 

expensive and requires a combination of several methods to obtain the most reliable 

results (Maeght et al., 2013). Methods for monitoring deep roots are grouped into direct 

and indirect techniques depending on the equipment needed, research aim and their 

respective advantages and drawbacks (Vogt et al., 1998; Hendricks et al., 2006). N 

budget, ecosystem carbon balance, starch and carbon fluxes approaches have been 

used to study and quantify indirectly deep root functioning at considerable soil depths 

and are described in detail by Vogt et al. (1998). As for the direct methods, excavation, 

trenches, sequential coring, ingrowth cores, rhizotron, and minirhizotrons have been 

used to monitor root dynamics in situ and have been described in detail by Maeght et 

al. (2013). Both indirect and direct approaches present potential biases leading to 

overestimation or underestimation of root growth and decomposition. Despite all these 

methods, there is no scientific consensus on which the most effective and reliable 

method is determining the dynamics of fine roots. Understanding spatial and temporal 

fine root distribution and functioning in deep soil layers is crucial for a better 

understanding of biosphere-atmosphere interactions (Zeng et al., 1998; Kleidon and 

Heimann, 2000), and hence for terrestrial biosphere models. Deep roots improve tree 

tolerance to drought (McDowell et al., 2008; Nardini et al., 2016) and store C in deep 

soil layers (Laclau et al., 2013). Their importance in the C cycle and water flow has 

been demonstrated through modeling simulations (Saleska et al., 2007; Christoffersen 

et al., 2014). Therefore, to understand and predict in the proper way water cycles, C 

sequestration, and primary production and many others ecosystem services we should 



81 
 

        
 

consider deep soil layers as dynamics and functional systems where fine roots may be 

different along the soil profile.  

1. 3 Deep fine root morphology, architecture and anatomy  

Root morphology and architecture are important in determining a plant's availability to 

survive in stressful soil conditions and can influence considerably tree growth and 

ecosystem processes. Root system morphology and architecture vary largely between 

species but also within species (Cannon, 1949; Nibau et al., 2008). Functional traits 

also vary with environmental conditions and resource distribution (Ostonen et al., 

2007). Root diameter and root length are two of the main criteria taken into account to 

evaluate root function and behavior. Fine roots have been classified into distinct 

classes for different functions and metabolic activity: i) root for acquisition and uptake 

of soil resources, therefore classified as absorptive roots are extremely fine and are 

the most distal roots; ii) root for transport and storage of nutrients are larger roots 

higher up in the branching order, which are the main structural part of the fine root 

system. The high variability of the environmental conditions such as soil moisture and 

temperature or nutrient availability along the soil depth result in contrasting fine root 

functional traits among depths. 

Deep fine root exploration also leads to an important metabolic cost for plants (Iversen, 

2010) which affect changes in fine root traits (Prieto et al., 2015). The specific root 

length (SRL) and specific root area (SRA) are the two main root traits affected by depth 

(Maurice et al., 2010; Prieto et al., 2015; Pinheiro et al., 2016). They represent together 

the volume of the root in contact with the soil, and indirectly describe the capacity to 

take up limited soil resources by the plant (Maurice et al., 2010). There are few studies 

on the variation of specific root length and specific root area according to soil depth 

(Makita et al., 2011; Prieto et al., 2015; Pinheiro et al., 2016), but the trends are still 

not clear. Indeed, Pinheiro et al. (2016) found a slight increase in SRL and SRA with 

soil depth down to 13.5 m for 4 different genotypes of Eucalyptus in Brazil. Maurice et 

al. (2010) also found that SRL increased down to a depth of 3 m in Eucalyptus 

plantations of different ages. Adriano et al. (2017) found no significant changes in SRL 

with soil depth down to 8 m in Citrus sinensis plantations, but they observed a tendency 

toward an increase in mean fine root diameters. Gwenzi et al. (2011) found that roots 

tended to be thicker down to a depth of 1.4 m in Acacia rostellifera and Melaleuca 



82 
 

 
 

nesophila plantations in Western Australia. Prieto et al. (2015) measured root 

functional traits in 20 plant communities in 3 climatic zones: tropical climate, montane 

climate, and sub-humid Mediterranean climate. They found that fine roots were thicker 

in deep soil layer down to a depth of 1.6 m compared to the shallow layers. On the 

contrary, Sochacki et al. (2017) observed that root diameter decreased systematically 

with depth down to 6 m in Eucalyptus globulus plantations in southwest Australia, and 

Bakker et al. (2009) found that SRL decreased with depth down to 1.2 m in Pinus 

pinaster plantations in the southwest of France. Fast-growing species require a rapid 

and efficient acquisition of above and belowground resources; therefore, they generally 

have a higher specific root area and specific root length compared to slow growing 

species particularly in deep soil layers (Ryser, 2006; Reich, 2014; Jo et al., 2015). 

Roots of high SRL and thinner diameter are often associated with a better exploitation 

capacity (Hodge, 2004), and they increase the amount of root surface area in contact 

with soil water. Establishing a deep root system with a high surface area allows the 

extraction of water from a larger soil volume (Jackson et al., 2000). Deep roots are 

mainly oriented toward water acquisition and transport. Indeed, McElrone et al. (2004) 

found that deep roots of Juniperus ashei, Bumelia lanuginosa, Quercus fusiformis and 

Quercus sinuate had higher vessel diameter and larger tracheid than shallow roots in 

deep soil layers down to 18-20 m (Figure 2). They also found that deep roots had a 

greater hydraulic conductivity. In line with those results, Pate et al. (1995) reported that 

roots at a depth of 2 m had larger xylem conduits, higher length, specific area, and 

hydraulic conductivities, up to 15 times higher than roots in shallow layers for Australian 

species. Physiological and anatomical adjustment of fine roots in deep soil seems to 

be developed by plants to maximize hydraulic efficiency. Despite those results, studies 

on fine root morphology and anatomy at great depth are still scarce.

Buchh., Quercus sinuata (Torr.) C.H. Mull and Bumelia lanuginosa tree species from 
the Edward’s Plateau region of central Texas (According to McElrone et al. 2004). 

1. 4 Deep fine roots phenology 

Fine roots in deep soil layers present contrasting phenology compared to roots in 

shallow soil layers. Indeed, several studies have shown an asynchrony between 

shallow and deep root emergence. Maeght et al. (2015) observed that shallow fine root 

emergence of Hevea brasiliensis was synchronized with rainfall events and ceased 

during the dry season. On the contrary deep fine root emergence occurred at the end 

of the wet season and continued during the dry season below a depth of 2.5 m. Germon 

et al. (2016) also observed an asynchrony between shallow and deep roots in an 

agroforestry system in the south of France. They found that summer season was 

dominated by shallow root growth and winter season by deep root growth (&gt; 2.5m). 

Similar results were observed in Eucalyptus plantations in Brazil, where root growth 

peaked below a depth of 3 m at the end of the dry season (Lambais et al., 2017; 

Germon et al., 2019). Germon et al. (2019) even found a negative correlation between 

the amount of extractable water in the topsoil and the flushes of growth in deep soil 

layers. Deep root growth seems to be related to overall tree water demand and 

controlled by the need for trees to use increasingly deeper water resources when water 

in the topsoil becomes scarce. Studies have shown that fine root elongation rates in 



84 
 

 
 

deep soil are more intense than in the topsoil, reaching several centimeters per day 

(Laclau et al., 2013; Germon et al., 2016; Lambais et al., 2017; Germon et al., 2019). 

A near-symmetrical above and below ground growth rates were observed by Christina 

et al. (2011) in Eucalyptus plantations reaching 10.4 and 19.2 m in height and a 

maximum rooting depth of 9.2 and 15.8 m at ages of 1.5 and 3.5 years, respectively. 

Those results are in line with the growth rates of Eucalyptus observed by Lambais et 

al. (2017) in nutrient-poor soil of Brazil with a mean fine root elongation rate increasing 

with soil depth up to 3.6 cm day-1 below a depth of 3 m. Increasing root growth rate is 

often seen as another feature of drought adaptation (Annerose and Cornaire, 1994). 

This high root elongation rate in deep soil layers could be a response to improve water 

and nutrients uptake, which confirm the positive feedback from developing roots to 

develop shoot (Friend et al., 1994). Fast root growth requires fast and efficient nutrient 

and water acquisition and thus a fast exploration of the deep soil layer. Environmental 

conditions and plant growth regulators may control those mechanisms (López-Bucio 

et al., 2003). Deep soil layers are assumed to have higher soil water content and low-

temperature variations compared to shallow layers (Du and Fang, 2014; Radville et al., 

2016). Thus, climatic factors being more buffered in the deep soil layer, fluctuating less 

during day and season, are not affecting equally root phenology along with the soil 

profile. Deep fine root phenology could be also controlled by other factors. Indeed, 

deep roots are more distant from the shoot and the time to receive photosynthates 

would take longer to occur. A slow process phloem transport could also explain the 

delay between shallow and deep root growth currently observed. Yet there are still 

major uncertainties about the mechanisms controlling fine root phenology in deep soil 

layers.  

1. 5 Mycorrhizal associations 

Root systems are also characterized by their likelihood of association with mycorrhizal 

fungi. Interactions between plant root system and mycorrhizal fungi have many 

beneficial effects. It can provide a source of C for mycorrhizal respiration in exchange 

for increased exploitation and transfer of water and nutrient from soil to the plant. Soil 

depth influence the diversity of microorganism and community composition as nutrient 

supply and oxygen is less favorable for microbial decomposition (Eilers et al., 2012; 

Santos et al., 2016). However, an abundant and diverse microbial community and high 

level of bacterial biomass have been found in very deep soil layers (Dodds et al., 1996; 



85 
 

        
 

Gocke et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2017). Stone et al. (2014) studied microbial community 

characteristics down to a depth of 1.4 m in a tropical soil of northeastern Puerto Rico. 

They unexpectedly found that extracellular microbial activity decreased in deep soil 

layers but C acquiring enzymes activities increased with depth. Recently, Robin et al. 

(2019) observed ectomycorrhizal roots down to a depth of 4 meters in a deeply 

weathered soil under Eucalyptus trees in Brazil. Deep root symbiosis with 

microorganism could potentially impact nutrient acquisition in deep soil layers and may 

enhance the exploitation of nutrient stock throughout the entire soil profile. Indeed, 

some studies highlighted that deep root and shallow roots had a different form of 

mycorrhizal symbioses (Rosling et al., 2003; Clemmensen et al., 2013). However, as 

for deep root functioning, studies on mycorrhizal symbiosis in deep soil are still very 

limited partly due to the difficulty to collect soil at such depths. Studying biological 

activities in deep soil layers is crucial for the scientific community and become 

increasingly important to address in future studies, yet it remains a methodological and 

technical challenge (Gocke et al., 2017).  

1. 6 Influence of soil resources and environmental parameters 

Soil resources and environment parameters are constantly changing. Deep roots are 

highly plastic in response to heterogeneous resource distributions (Hodge et al., 2009). 

They have the ability to adapt to changing resource availability and in particular to 

water availability, nutrients availability, soil texture, and atmospheric constituents. The 

variability of environmental factors affecting root growth are buffered in deep soil 

condition compared to the considerable variability observed at the soil surface 

(Voroney, 2007). Differences in root structure, architecture, and production in deep soil 

layers might be attributed to differences in soil resources and physical properties.  

Soil water content is maybe the main driver for root production in the deep soil layers. 

Adriano et al. (2017) observed that fine root mass of Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck 

increased in drought conditions, particularly in deep soil layers. Schenk and Jackson 

(2002) reported that rooting depths were correlated with the length of the dry season 

and annual precipitation in tropical climates. The longer dry season and lower annual 

precipitation, the deeper was the root system. Wang et al. (2015) also found a strong 

correlation between root mass and soil water content down to a depth of 21 m in 

planted grassland and shrubland in China. Drought can increase the proportion of fine 



86 
 

 
 

roots in deep soil layers and/or the specific root area (Markesteijn and Poorter, 2009; 

Ma et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2018). In a survey of 62 tropical tree species, Markesteijn 

and Poorter (2009) showed that trees increase the belowground biomass and the 

proportion of deep roots in response to dry conditions. Germon et al. (2019) showed 

an increase in SRL and SRA under drought conditions for Eucalyptus trees in Brazil. 

Root growth peaks have been shown in deep soil layers during dry periods for eucalypt 

and rubber trees in tropical soils (Maeght et al., 2015; Lambais et al., 2017). Plant 

species use a large range of rooting patterns to cope with periodic drought, from 

"drought tolerant strategies" with fine roots surviving in periodically dry soil to "drought 

avoiding strategies" shedding fine roots from dry soil horizons while rapidly developing 

roots in moister areas (Brunner et al., 2015; Vries et al., 2016; Bristiel et al., 2018). 

Root dynamics are also strongly correlated to the depth of the water table. Li et al. 

(2015) found a higher root growth rate when the water table was artificially deeper for 

Alhagi sparsifolia Shap. (Leguminosae). They found a root front growth of 0.66 cm d-1 

when the water table was at a depth of 0.8 m and 1.5 cm d-1 when the water table was 

at a depth of 2.2 m. Canham et al. (2012) found a seasonal distribution of fine root 

biomass in deep soil layers following the fluctuations of the depth of the water table. A 

deeper water table level might induce a higher root elongation downwards (Stave et 

al., 2005; Canham, 2011). 

Soil texture also influences morphological acclimation of a deep root system. Root 

distribution has been showed to be shallower in sandy soils than in soil with a finer 

texture as shown in a tropical evergreen forest by Schenk and Jackson (2002). Xu and 

Li (2009) observed that root of Haloxyolon ammodendron C.A. Mey penetrated down 

to a depth of 10 m in a sandy soil, while it only reached 3 m in a heavy soil.  Roots had 

a higher root surface area in the sandy soil compared to roots growing in the heavy 

soil. Freycon et al. (2015) also compared root distribution down to 6 m for 

Entandrophragma cylindricum Sprague (Meliaceae) grown in two different soil types: 

Arenosols and Ferralsols in an African semi-deciduous rainforest. They found that fine 

root intersects on vertical pit walls were lower in coarse-textured soils (e.g. Arenosols) 

than in fine-textured soils (e.g. Ferralsols). However, Canadell et al. (1996) cited some 

examples of roots reaching great depths in rocky soils.  



87 
 

        
 

In most plant-soil systems, the amount of available nutrients is a growth-limiting factor. 

Indeed, McCulley et al. (2004) studied fine roots and nutrient distribution down to a 

depth of 10 m in five semi-arid and arid sites in the southwestern USA. They found that 

roots responded through morphological and physiological adjustment in response to 

nutrient availability within the soil profile. Bordron et al. (2019) found that fertilization 

increased the capacity of fine roots of Eucalyptus grandis to take up nutrients down to 

a depth of 3.2 m. They also found that adding nutrients increased root mass density, 

specific root length and specific root area along with the soil profile down to 3 m. On 

the contrary, Jourdan et al. (2008) showed that an increase in N content did not 

influence fine root biomass down to 3.0 m. Root growth and functioning are inhibited 

by high pH values due to nutrient deficiencies and specific ion toxicities (Hinsinger, 

2001; Hinsinger et al., 2003; Jacobs and Timmer, 2005). The response of fine root 

production and mortality on nutrient availability in deep soil layers is not completely 

understood and further studies are needed.   

Many studies have focused on the impact of elevated CO2 concentrations in the 

atmosphere on plant growth. Fine root responses in changing CO2 conditions are still 

poorly known but some trends have emerged. Iversen (2010) reviewed that rising 

atmospheric CO2 concentration tends to deeper rooting distributions of forested 

ecosystems. However, the set of studies used to focus on the upper soil profile down 

to usually a depth of 1 m. To our knowledge, only one study reached the threshold of 

1 m depth concerning the influence of elevated atmospheric CO2 on root properties. 

Indeed, Duursma et al. (2011) found that root water uptake of Eucalyptus saligna 

plantation in Australia was higher at depth &gt; 1 m when trees are subjected to higher 

atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Studies on the influence of elevated CO2 on root 

biomass production and distribution need to be carried in much greater detail, and 

particularly in deep soil layers.  

1. 7 Deep fine root biomass and carbon sequestration 

It is essential to assess more precisely the capacity of ecosystems to store carbon to 

predict their potential role on the mitigation of the future economic and ecological 

challenges linked to climate changes. More and more research effort focused on C 

accounting across ecosystems. Fine roots play a major role in the global carbon cycle. 

They represent a significant C input to the soil by the incorporation of exudates and 



88 
 

 
 

root necromass and generate a return of C to the atmosphere through respiration and 

decomposition processes (Balesdent and Balabane, 1996; Strand et al., 2008). 

Estimating fine root production, biomass and turnover throughout the entire soil profile 

is therefore compulsory in this context.  

Even if root density decrease with depth, some studies evidenced that total root 

biomass below the threshold of 1 m depth can account for more than currently 

admitted. Indeed, Maeght et al. (2015) found that more than 50% of the overall fine 

root biomass was below 1 m depth in a rubber plantation in Thailand. Fine root biomass 

between 1.0 and 4.0 m was 5.8 t ha-1 and was only 4.8 t ha-1 in the soil layer 0-1 m. In 

line with those results, Pinheiro et al. (2016) found that fine root length below 0.5 m 

represented 61-77% of the total fine root length down to the root front in Eucalyptus 

plantations. In an agroforestry system in the south of France, Cardinael et al. (2015) 

found that 35% of the total fine root intersection densities of walnut trees were below 

a depth of 2 m. In the same site, using the minirhizotron technique, Germon et al. 

(2016) measured that 25% of total fine root production was observed below a depth of 

4 m. Falkiner et al. (2006) observed that Eucalyptus grandis root proliferation resulted 

in equal root length densities between 0-0.5 m and 2.4-2.8 m soil layers in another 

agroforestry system in south-eastern Australia. Germon et al. (2018) observed fine root 

biomass represented 31% of total biomass in Eucalyptus grandis monospecific stands, 

52% in Acacia mangium monospecific stands and 37% in a mixture stands with 50% 

of both species in the 0-1 m soil layers. Furthermore, the proportion of roots at great 

depth increase with stand age: Ma et al. (2013) found that fine roots below 1 m 

represented 10.54 %, 29.62% and 42.42% of the total roots in 2 years, 4 years and 12 

years of Ziziphus jujube Mill. CV. Lizao plantation in China, and Laclau et al. (2013) 

found that fine roots below a depth of 4 m represented 5%, 10% and 15% of total fine 

roots in year 1, 3.5 and 6 after planting of Eucalyptus plantation in Brazil. Li et al. (2019) 

observed that rooting depth increased with increasing stand age, reaching 23.2 m in a 

22-year-old apple orchard stand in a sub-humid region of China, and roots below a 

depth of 1 m accounted for 49% of the total root biomass. Therefore, deep roots 

represent a high proportion of the total root system and might contribute to 

sequestrating large amounts of C in soil (Matamala et al., 2003; Rasse et al., 2005) 

especially in deep soil layers (Kell, 2012).  



89 
 

        
 

Several studies have shown that root lifespan generally increases with soil depth 

(Hendrick and Pregitzer, 1996; Baddeley and Watson, 2005). Wells et al. (2002) found 

that root longevity of Prunus persica L. significantly increased with soil depth down to 

1.6 m. Germon et al. (2016) also found a higher proportion of walnut root mortality in 

the topsoil that in the deep soil layers with a median life span of 167 days within the 

first soil meter and 208 days at 2.5-4.7 m depth in an agroforestry system in the south 

of France. But on the contrary, Maeght et al. (2015) found that root life span decreased 

with soil depth down to a depth of 4.5 m in a rubber tree plantation in Thailand. Maeght 

et al. (2015) found that roots between the depth of 1 and 2.5 m had a turnover of about 

180-250 days and roots below 3 m of soil depth had a turnover of about 120 days. 

Lambais et al. (2017) found no significant differences in root lifespan of Eucalyptus 

trees between the topsoil and a depth of 6 m in Brazil, but root mortality represented 

almost 20% in the topsoil and only 3.4 % between 5 and 6 m depth. It is known that 

environmental parameters (e.g., temperature, water content, N availability, CO2 and 

probably O2 partial pressure) influence fine root turnover to variable degrees (Vogt et 

al. 1996), which could explain the opposite trends observed by those studies. Fine root 

decomposition rate affects the ability of ecosystems to store organic C and act as a 

sink for CO2. The capacity of a different ecosystem to sequestrate carbon is related to 

the depth where roots are being decomposed. When roots are decomposed, parts of 

the former tissues are incorporated into the soil organic matter (Strand et al., 2008). 

De Camargo et al. (1999) found that fine roots were being decomposed at least down 

to a depth of 5 m in eastern Amazon. Nepstad et al. (1994) estimated using isotopic 

tracers that C stocks below a depth of 1 m exceed organic soil C in the topsoil layer 

down to 1 m and the above-ground organic C in an Amazonian tropical forest. Indeed, 

the deep root system of this Amazonian forest input a large amount of organic carbon 

into the soil by root exudations, mycorrhizal associations and dead root tissues 

(Nepstad et al., 1994). Moreover, the microbial biomass is lower in deep soil layers 

than in the topsoil, which in combination with oxygen limitations could enhance organic 

C sequestration as a result of low mineralization rates (Taylor et al., 2002; Rumpel and 

Kögel-Knabner, 2011). Organic C derived from roots is generally more sequestered in 

the soil than organic C coming from the aboveground litter. The latter is more affected 

by physicochemical processes and has a different structural composition (Rasse et al., 

2005; Schmidt et al., 2011; Menichetti et al., 2015). It is therefore essential to estimate 

fine root production, biomass and turnover, and associated microbial communities 



90 
 

 
 

throughout the entire soil profile according to its environment to estimate adequately 

the overall C sequestration. 

1. 8 Deep fine root functioning and nutrient mobilization 

In addition to their importance for water uptake, deep fine roots may be essential to 

supply trees’ nutrient requirements. Yet deep root functioning may vary over soil depth 

and the presence of roots in a given soil layer may not always correspond to root 

activity (Phillips et al., 2016). Indeed, Göransson et al. (2006) showed that equal root 

abundance does not mean equal uptake of nutrients in Quercus robur L. plantations 

and that there is a contrasting potential uptake between deep and shallow layers. The 

depth of nutrient uptake performed by tree roots is commonly estimated using tracers. 

Bordron et al. (2019) showed a functional specialization of Eucalyptus fine roots to take 

up cations varying over depth from 15NO3?, Rb+ (K+ analog) and Sr2+ (Ca2+ analog) 

tracers injected at depths of 10, 50, 150 and 300 cm in a sandy Ferralsol soil in Brazil. 

They demonstrated that potential uptake of fine roots of 2-year-old Eucalyptus trees 

was significantly higher at a depth of 3 m than in the topsoil for Rb+ and Sr2+. Da Silva 

et al. (2011) also found an increase of the uptake rates at depth for K+ and Ca2+ analogs 

compared to the topsoil in a 6-year-old Eucalyptus plantation, and on the contrary, they 

found that NO3- uptake was higher in the topsoil than at 3 m. Therefore, trees show 

great flexibility in root development and on their capability to adjust resource uptake in 

layers where the resources are available (Jackson et al., 1990; Hutchings and de 

Kroon, 1994; Robinson, 1996). The functional specialization of deep roots is important 

to reduced nutrient losses through deep drainage (Laclau et al., 2010). The previous 

estimations of nutrient leaching may therefore be over-estimated, as they were not 

considering nutrient uptake by deep roots when measuring only soil water 

concentration and fluxes at depth. 

Deep roots strongly influence the water cycles and are essential to sustain high tree 

transpiration in the dry season (Kleidon and Heimann, 2000; Saleska et al., 2007). Soil 

water content monitoring and the use of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes allow to 

estimate at which depth root water uptake is performed (Guderle and Hildebrandt, 

2015; Beyer et al., 2016; Koeniger et al., 2016; Trogisch et al., 2016; Beyer et al., 

2018). Stahl et al. (2013) showed that 46.1% of the trees were extracting water at or 

below a depth of 1.2 m in a tropical rainforest. Trees developed efficient strategies for 



91 
 

        
 

water resource acquisition in deep soil layers using deep roots, which may also help 

sustain shallow root functioning during drought through hydraulic redistribution 

(Burgess et al., 1998; Domec et al., 2004; Bleby et al., 2010). Burgess et al. (2001) 

have demonstrated that Eucalyptus species have the capacity to redistribute water 

from wetter deep layers into shallow soil layers through roots. Furthermore, a modeling 

approach showed that the occurrence of rainfall events, changing from a week to 

another, had a strong impact on which depth water uptake occurs (Christina et al., 

2017). Recently, Li et al. (2019) showed that the extraction of deep soil water by the 

root system of apple orchard stands was mainly occurring at depths below 12 m in a 

sub-humid region of China. They also found that roots in the 1-12 m layer remained 

alive mainly to transport the water absorbed below 12 m as they might not extract 

additional water (Li et al., 2019). Therefore, modeling processes need to consider deep 

root functioning to estimate net ecosystem productivity as a deep-water loss might 

contribute equivalently to the evaporation at the global scale than sallow soil water 

loss.   

1. 9 Deep fine root and modeling approaches 

Modeling architecture development and dynamics of the deep fine roots is hindered by 

the limited data available in the literature, yet indispensable to parametrize and 

evaluate the models. Root number, root diameter, root volume, and root radial 

distances are the main parameters of root system biomechanics (Nicoll and Ray, 1996; 

Danquechin Dorval et al., 2016), varying considerably with soil layers. Soil depth 

strongly influences the root system architecture due to the heterogeneity of its 

environment. Root architectural models could simulate accurately spatial and temporal 

dynamics through a simulation of the root system in 3D. Integrating a vertically 

discretized soil into a model is particularly important as shallow and deep roots present 

different spatial and temporal dynamics. Model parametrization needs to consider 

shallow and deeper-rooted systems behaving differently according to the 

environmental factors and soil conditions. Indeed, these models are parametrized 

according to the definition of root types (e.g. RootTyp from Pagès et al. (2004) or DigR 

from Barczi et al. (2018)) or by branching order (e.g. OpenSimRoot from Postma et al. 

(2017)) or through parametric L-system modeling (Leitner et al., 2010) which also might 

vary with soil layer. Such a model without discretized processes by soil layers is not 

capable to simulate accurately the impact of environmental conditions and soil 



92 
 

 
 

resources on root development. Models devoted to simulating water and nutrient 

uptake dynamics need to integrate the functional specialization of deep roots and root 

growth plasticity in response to environmental conditions, in particular in deep soil 

layers. However, most root functioning rules are still not completely understood, 

especially for the ones occurring at great depth due to the extreme difficulty of 

measuring those processes in situ. Therefore, model calibration must cope with this 

knowledge and experimental limits. Architectural models can also be coupled with 

models simulating nutrient uptake (Mayer, 1999; Bonneu et al., 2012; Mayer et al., 

2012), water transport (Doussan et al., 1998) or rhizospheric processes (Kim and Silk, 

1999) or even reactive transport model (Mayer, 1999; Mayer et al., 2012; Gérard et al., 

2017). Nevertheless, it can be convenient to simulate accurately the overall 

architecture and any specialized functions of deep roots compared to shallow roots.  

Furthermore, deep roots have a strong influence on deep carbon stocks, which 

represent a significant amount of carbon (Jobbágy and Jackson, 2004) and can be 

partially renewed at the 10-year scale (Baisden and Parfitt, 2007; Koarashi et al., 

2012). Models predicting soil organic carbon stocks through a single soil layer 

modeling approach (Hansen et al., 1991; Sallih and Pansu, 1993; Petersen et al., 2005; 

Pansu et al., 2010; Oelbermann and Voroney, 2011) are therefore not considering 

deep soil and their roots that play an active role in carbon cycling. In recent years, an 

awareness of the importance of deep carbon stocks by the modeling community has 

led to the development of different discretized models depending on the soil depth 

(Braakhekke et al., 2011; Braakhekke et al., 2013; Guenet et al., 2013; Taghizadeh-

Toosi et al., 2014). However, modeling accurately deep root dynamics and their active 

role for carbon allocation, nutrient and water uptake according to the plant 

development over time remains a major challenge for the next decades.

1. 10 Conclusion 

Deep root systems are complex components of ecosystems. Deep roots display 

different functional specialization, anatomy and morphology and are mainly oriented 

toward water acquisition and transport (Table 1 - Root traits at depth compared to the 

topsoil.  indicates a predominantly positive trend,  indicates a predominantly 

negative trend and indicates predominantly no effect. Categories of root traits and 

individual root traits are adapted from Brunner et al. 2015, Brunner et al. 2009, 

McCormack et al. 2012, Prieto et al. 2015. 

). Climatic factors affect differently root phenology along with the soil profile as there 

are more buffered in deep soil layers. Research devoted to deep fine root dynamics 

linking anatomical, architectural and functional characteristics along very deep soil 

profiles to site characteristics, species and soil conditions should be carried out to gain 

insight into their impact on C, water and nutrient cycles. Deep fine root display plasticity 

by responding to changing soil conditions and have an important role for ecosystem 

functioning. It is then crucial to focus the research efforts on the understanding of deep 

root dynamics and associated functions which could have a significant influence on 

climate change mitigation.

CHAPTER 2 - CONSEQUENCES OF CLEAR-CUTTING AND DROUGHT ON 

FINE ROOT DYNAMICS DOWN TO 17 M IN COPPICE-MANAGED 

EUCALYPT PLANTATION 

 

We saw in chapter 1 that despite the actual insights about the importance of fine roots 

in depth, current knowledge of their dynamics is still extremely limited. The evaluation 

of the contribution of fine roots in deep soil layers is a real metrological challenge and, 

in fact, a major scientific lock, which is important to raise to study the sustainability of 

agroecosystems and forest plantation, as well as their resilience, in the context of 

global changes. 

The central objective of this following chapter is to assess the effect of clear-cutting 

and drought on fine-root production throughout deep soil profiles down to the water 

table in coppice-managed Brazilian eucalypt plantations. These effects were monitored 

before and after trees harvest in a coppice-managed Eucalyptus grandis plantation 

under two contrasting water supply regimes.  

This chapter presents the results of 3 years of root dynamics monitoring and was 

published in the journal Forest Ecology and Management as scientific article with the 

title: “Consequences of clear-cutting and drought on fine root dynamics down to 17 m 

in coppice-managed eucalypt plantations”. Co-authors associated with this project are

Abstract 

Improving our understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of fine roots in deep soil 

layers is of utter importance to manage tropical planted forests in a context of climate 

change. Our study aimed to assess the effect of clear-cutting and drought on fine-root 

dynamics down to the water table in Brazilian ferralsol under eucalypt plantations 

conducted in coppice. Fine roots (i.e. diameter &amp;lt;2 mm) were sampled down to 17 m 

deep in a throughfall exclusion experiment comparing stands with 37% of throughfall 

excluded by plastic sheets (-W) and stands without rain exclusion (+W). Root dynamics 

were studied using minirhizotron in two permanent pits down to 17 m deep, over 1 year 

before clear-cutting, then over 2 years in coppice, as well as down to 4 m deep in a 

non-harvested plot (NH) serving as a control. After harvesting, a spectacular fine root 

growth of trees conducted in coppice occurred in very deep soil layers (&gt; 13 m) and, 

surprisingly, root mortality remained extremely low whatever the depth and the 

treatment. Total fine-root biomass in coppice down to 17 m depth was 1266 and 1017 

g m-2 in +W and -W, respectively, at 1.5 year after the clear-cut and was 1078 g m-2 in 

NH 7.5 years after planting. Specific root length and specific root area were about 15% 

higher in -W than in +W. Proliferation of fine roots at great depths could be an adaptive 

mechanism for tree survival, enhancing the access to water stored in the subsoil. The 

root system established before clear-cutting provides access to water stored in very 

deep layers that probably contribute to mitigate the risk of tree mortality during 

prolonged drought periods when the eucalypt plantations is conducted in coppice after 

the clear-cut.

2.1 Introduction  

Future climate projections predict longer and more severe dry periods in tropical and 

subtropical regions (Dai, 2011; He &amp;amp; Soden, 2017; Solomon et al., 2009). Extensive 

tree mortality triggered by drought and changes in rainfall patterns has been reported 

worldwide (Allen, 2009; McDowell et al., 2018; Williams et al., 2013). Tree survival 

greatly depends on rooting system behavior and functioning (Christina et al., 2017b; 

Markewitz et al., 2010; Nepstad et al., 1994; Pierik  &amp;amp; Testerink, 2014), as plant growth 

is highly dependent on the absorptive function of fine roots for water and nutrients 

(Hinsinger, 2001). Fine roots also play a major role in the global carbon (C) cycle, 

representing significant C input into the soil by the incorporation of exudates and root 

necromass, and also generating a return of C to the atmosphere through respiration 

and decomposition processes (Balesdent &amp;amp; Balabane, 1996; Strand et al., 2008). 

Improving our understanding of how root systems respond to drought is therefore 

crucial for terrestrial biosphere models to predict the effect of climate change on tree 

survival and carbon sequestration in forest and tree-based ecosystems.  

Plant species use a large range of rooting patterns to cope with periodic drought, from 

“drought tolerant strategies” with fine roots surviving in periodically dry soil, to “drought 

avoiding strategies” shedding fine roots from dry soil horizons while rapidly developing 

roots in moister areas (Bristiel et al., 2018; Brunner et al., 2015; Vries et al., 2016). 

Drought can increase the root-to-shoot ratio, the root area or root length-to-leaf area 

ratio, as well as the proportion of fine roots in deep soil layers and/or the specific root 

area (Ma et al., 2018; Markesteijn &amp;amp; Poorter, 2009; Zhou et al., 2018). Root growth 

peaks have been shown in deep soil layers during dry periods for eucalypt and rubber 

trees in tropical soils (Lambais et al., 2017; Maeght et al., 2015a). Drought tolerance 

strategies are common for herbaceous plants, while drought avoiding strategies are 

often adopted by trees in evergreen tropical forests (Brunner et al., 2015). Despite the 

crucial role of fine roots in coping with drought, root phenology remains poorly 

understood in comparison to leaf ecophysiology (Radville et al., 2016a).  

Deep roots commonly reported as roots growing beyond 1 m in depth can play an 

important role in supplying water to trees (Kell, 2012; Pierret et al., 2016a). Trees can 

be deeply rooted (Canadell et al., 1996; Schenk &amp;amp; Jackson, 2002), and some studies 

suggest that very deep roots (at depths &gt; 10 m) are common in highly weathered 



111 
 

        
 

tropical soils (Broedel et al., 2017; Nepstad et al., 1994; Saleska et al., 2007). Even 

though low fine root densities are generally found at great depth (Pierret et al., 2016a), 

they can take up substantial amounts of water needed for tree survival during drought 

periods (McDowell et al., 2008; Nardini et al., 2016). Deep roots can also contribute to 

closing the biogeochemical cycles in tropical forests through nutrient uptake in deep 

soil layers (Bordron et al., 2018; Da Silva et al., 2011; Jobbágy  &amp;amp; Jackson, 2004; 

Lehmann, 2003), which reduces nutrient losses by deep leaching (Laclau et al., 2010; 

Lehmann  &amp;amp; Schroth, 2003). While many studies show that the role of very deep roots 

in tropical forest functioning and productivity has been greatly underestimated 

(Freycon et al., 2015; Jackson et al., 2000; Markewitz et al., 2010), as far as we are 

aware, fine root dynamics and mortality have never been studied at depths &gt; 10 m. 

Eucalyptus plantations cover more than 20 million hectares and account for around 

8% of forest plantations in the world (Booth, 2013). The diversity of Eucalyptus species 

planted in tropical regions has led to a wide range of products and management 

practices (Gonçalves et al., 2013). Although many Eucalyptus plantations are 

intensively managed to produce raw materials for industry (mainly pulp and paper, but 

also solid-wood products, fiberboards and charcoal for steel production), used as a 

domestic source of energy and also contributes to alleviating poverty in developing 

countries (Cossalter &amp;amp; Pye-Smith, 2003). Most eucalypt plantations are located in 

areas with low soil fertility and prolonged drought periods (Keenan et al., 2015). 

Coppice management could be an adaptive solution to cope with water deficit in these 

plantations, because the sprouts growing on stumps are likely to benefit from the pre-

existing root system that explores deep soil layers where water availability is generally 

higher than in the topsoil. The effects of clear-cutting on fine root dynamics in coppiced-

managed forest plantations are poorly documented and tendencies are not clear. 

Sequential coring in Brazilian coppiced-managed eucalypt plantations showed that fine 

root density decreased in the 0-1 m soil layer in the first 60 days after harvesting, while 

fine root decomposition was accelerated (Mello et al., 2007). Fine root mortality 

exceeded fine root production after clear-cutting in Populus stands (Berhongaray et 

al., 2015). In contrast, Dickmann et al. (1996) observed little change in fine root 

production and mortality in the 0-1 m soil layer after clear-cutting in other Populus 

stands. While 50% of fine root biomass can be found below a depth of 1 m in tropical 

eucalypt plantations (Christina et al., 2011b; Laclau et al., 2013a), fine root dynamics 



112 
 

 
 

in coppice-managed forests have only been studied in the upper meter of the soil 

profile. 

Our study was carried out in Eucalyptus grandis (Hill ex. Maid) stands planted in a 

throughfall exclusion experiment in Brazil (Battie?Laclau et al., 2014b). We aimed to 

gain insight into the effects of contrasting rainfall regimes on fine root dynamics in 

coppice-managed eucalypt plantations after tree clear-cutting in very deep tropical 

soils. We put forward the hypothesis that trees invest in belowground biomass in 

response to throughfall exclusion, in order to increase the exploration of fine roots in 

deep soil layers (H1), and that they adjust fine root traits to increase the specific root 

area, in order to capture more resources per gram of C invested in fine roots (H2). In 

addition, we put forward the hypothesis that Eucalyptus grandis stands with clear-

cutting and tree regrowth in coppices stimulate fine root growth in both shallow and 

deep soil layers (H3) and increase root mortality throughout the soil profile (H4). 

2.2 Materials and Methods 

2.2.1 Study site 

The experiments were conducted at the research station owned by the Luiz de Queiroz 

College of Agriculture (ESALQ) near Itatinga (São Paulo, Brazil, 23°02?S 48°38?W). 

The study area, located 300 km from the sea, has a relief typical of the São Paulo 

Western Plateau, with a topography varying from flat to hilly (slopes &amp;lt;3%). The altitude 

is 850 m, and the climate is humid subtropical with a dry winter (Cwa) according to the 

Köppen classification. Over the 15 years prior to this study, the mean annual rainfall 

was 1390 mm (with 74% between October and May), and the mean air temperature 

and relative humidity were 20°C and 77%, respectively. A dry and cool (15°C) season 

occurs between June and September. The total rainfall over the study period (from 

May 2015 to July 2018) was 5629 mm. The annual rainfall was 1,557 mm and 2,303 

mm in 2016 and 2017, respectively. The soils are very deep Ferralsols (IUSS Working 

Group WRB, 2015) developed on Cretaceous sandstone. Clay content ranges from 

160 mg g-1 soil in the topsoil to about 250 mg g-1 soil at a depth of 15 m, and clay 

minerals are mainly kaolinite (Christina et al., 2015). 

 



113 
 

        
 

2.2.2 Experimental layout 

A split-plot experimental design was set up in June 2010 with a Eucalyptus grandis 

clone used in commercial plantations by the Suzano Company (São Paulo, Brazil). 

The experimental layout with 6 treatments and 3 blocks was described in detail by 

Battie?Laclau et al. (2014b). We studied two treatments out of all those available in the 

experimental design: one treatment with undisturbed rainfall (+W) and one treatment 

with throughfall exclusion (-W), which was equipped with plastic sheets installed since 

September 2010, allowing the exclusion of 37% of throughfall (Battie?Laclau et al., 

2014b). Treatments -W and +W were used to determine the water deficit effect. The 

trees were planted in June 2010 at a spacing of 3 m x 2 m with a stocking density of 

1666 trees per hectare. The plots received a standard commercial fertilizer (at planting: 

3.3 g P m-2, 200 g m-2 of dolomitic lime and trace elements; at 3 months of age: 12 g 

N m-2, 0.45 mol K m-2 applied as KCl) and herbicides were applied to avoid the 

presence of other understory species. In +W and -W, the eucalypt stands were 

harvested six years after planting, in June 2016, and the plantation was coppice-

managed thereafter. Several new shoots were regenerated from the stumps after the 

clear-cut and 1 or 2 shoots per stump were selected to maintain the same stocking 

density and prevent the growth of additional new shoots. A third treatment served as a 

control, with undisturbed rainfall and no harvest (NH), to assess the clear-cutting effect. 

Tree height and circumference at breast height were recorded each year after the 

clear-cut on 36 central trees per plot during the first rotation (May 2010 - June 2016) 

and during the second rotation in coppice (starting in June 2016). 

2.2.3 Soil water monitoring 

The volumetric soil water content (SWC) was monitored in the +W and -W treatments 

throughout the study period at half-hourly intervals using CS616 probes (Campbell 

Scientific Inc., Logan, UT, USA) installed at the following depths: 0.15, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 

6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 m, with 3 probes at each depth in block 1. Extractable water 

(mm) was calculated as the difference between the current soil water stock (mm) and 

the minimum soil water stock (i.e. lower limit of soil water content in mm) (Granier et 

al., 1999). 

2.2.4 Deep permanent pits for root phenology observations 



114 
 

 
 

Between February and March 2014, two deep permanent pits were excavated in +W 

and -W in block 1 to gain access to the complete soil profile from the top soil down to 

the water table. The pits were 1.5 m in diameter and reached a depth of 17 m and were 

located between four Eucalyptus trees (Figure 1) at a distance of 90 cm, 90 cm, 130 

cm and 130 cm from each four trees respectively. The pit walls were made of concrete 

rings in direct contact with the soil. Clear-colored roofs of the same diameter as the 

pits were used to prevent light and rain entering the pits. Platforms were set up at two-

meter intervals in the pits, equipped with artificial lighting and fans used during working 

sessions, allowing access and safe work down to the water table (Figure 1). The high 

cost of opening up and securing these pits prevented further replications in the other 

two blocks. However, other measurements, including deep fine root sampling and tree 

growth were carried out in all three blocks, making it possible to extrapolate some of 

the observations made in the two deep pits. In October 2015, a third pit was excavated 

in the non-harvested treatment (NH) down to 3.5 m to determine the clear-cut effect. 

 

2.2.5 Minirhizotrons  

Fine root dynamics were studied through transparent polyvinyl chloride tubes 

(length:180  cm; inner diameter: 6.5 cm), commonly called minirhizotrons (Maeght et 

al., 2013). In October 2014, twenty-four transparent minirhizotrons were installed using 

a powerhead drill in the +W and -W treatments of block 1. Outside the pits, three 

minirhizotrons were inserted into the soil surface in the same plots a minimum of 10 m 

apart and at a distance of 90 cm from the trunk (Figure 1). Nine tubes were inserted 

into the pit walls down to a depth of 17 m: two tubes at a depth of 1 m and one tube at 

depths of 3.5, 5.5, 7.5, 9.5, 11.5, 13.5, 15.5 m (Figure 1). The tubes were inserted at a 

45-degree angle and allowed an observation depth of 1.3 m below the depth at which 

they were inserted into the soil profile. In October 2015, 3 additional tubes were 

installed at the soil surface in the +W and -W treatments of blocks 2 and 3 (12 tubes in 

total) to increase the number of replications in the top meter. In October 2015, seven 

tubes were installed in the NH treatments (3 into the soil surface, 2 tubes inserted at 

depths of 1 m and 3.5 m into the pit walls).  



115 
 

        
 

Root dynamics were recorded using a circular scanner system (CI-600 Root Growth 

Monitoring System, CID, USA). This scanner was selected for the quality of the images 

it produces, an essential element for the analysis (Graefe et al., 2008). In order to have 

a significant stabilization period after soil disturbance from the installation, fine root 

monitoring began eight months after minirhizotron installation (Germon et al., 2016; 

Graefe et al., 2008). Eight images (21.59 x 19.56 cm, 100 dpi) per tube (43 tubes in 

total) were taken every two weeks for more than three consecutive years from May 

2015 to July 2018: over one year before the clear-cut and two years after harvesting, 

in a coppice. Images were taken at a resolution of 100 dpi, as we obtained the same 

root lengths and diameter compared to images of 300 dpi and 600 dpi, and it was less 

time-consuming in the field than with a higher resolution.

117 
 

        
 

2.2.6 Root image processing  

WinRhizoTron™ software (Régent Instrument Inc., Quebec, Canada) was used to 

analyze more than 24,000 root images taken in the minirhizotrons. This software was 

chosen as it allowed the analysis of large number of images and overlayed the images 

to visualize the time evolution of the roots throughout the tubes. This manual root 

measurement program estimated the length and diameter of each root observed and 

stored each data item in a text file. By comparing two consecutive images 

chronologically, it was possible to estimate changes in root length and phenology 

features. Root mortality was evaluated based on the absence of growth over the entire 

study period up to the last images, when roots turned black and presented clear signs 

of decomposition (Germon et al., 2016; Lambais et al., 2017). For each fine root 

(diameter &amp;lt;2 mm) we recorded the time of the first appearance, the diameter, the 

length over time, and the time of disappearance. In this study, we considered only root 

appearing during the study period.  

2.2.7 Root length calculations 

As described in Germon et al. (2016) and Lambais et al. (2017) the following metrics 

were used to estimate root production and the root elongation rate: living and dead 

root length production (LP, cm m-2) was calculated for each root as the individual root 

length (living or dead) at time t divided by the observed soil area of each image. The 

cumulative living or dead root length production (CLP, cm m-2) was calculated 

summing, at each time t, the individual length of all the roots observed, divided by the 

observed soil area of each image. The individual root elongation rate (RER, cm day-1) 

was calculated as the difference in individual root length observed between two 

consecutive sessions (t and t-1) divided by the time in days between t and t-1. The daily 

root elongation rate (DRER, cm m-2 day-1) was calculated by summing, at each time t, 

each individual root elongation rate of all the roots observed, divided by the observed 

soil area of each image. The mean root elongation rate (MeanRER, cm day-1) and the 

maximum root elongation rate (MaxRER, cm day-1) were calculated as the mean and 

the maximum of individual root elongation rates considering all the roots growing 

during the study period. LLP, CLP, RER, DRER, MeanRER and MaxRER were 

estimated for each treatment (+W, -W and NH), each soil layer and between 

consecutive image sessions over the entire study period. 



118 
 

 
 

2.2.8 Root sampling 

In order to check the consistency of fine root dynamics in deep soil layers observed by 

the minirhizotron method, total fine root biomass, fine root length and fine root area 

down to the water table were measured in October 2017, i.e. 1.5 years after the clear-

cut in the coppices (+W and -W) and 7.5 years after planting in NH. Fine roots 

(diameter &amp;lt;2 mm) were sampled down to 17 m in the two treatments (+W and -W) 

inside the three blocks and in the non-harvested (NH) treatment inside one block. Four 

trees were randomly selected in each plot and soil samples were collected around 

each tree between the topsoil and a depth of  2 m and around 2 other trees between 

depths of 2 and 17 m (i.e. 12 sampling points down to a depth of 2 m and 6 further 

down to a depth of 17 m in the +W and -W treatments and 4 sampling points down to 

a depth of 2 m and 2 down to a depth of 17 m in the NH treatment). At each sampling 

position, soil layers at 0-0.2, 0.2-0.5, 0.5-1, 1-1.5, 1.5-2 m were collected using a 

cylindrical auger with an inner diameter of 4.5 cm. The Brazilian “cavadeira” tool, a 

cylindrical auger with an inner diameter of 9 cm and a length of 30 cm, was used to 

collect soil cores every 50 cm from 2 m down to a depth of 17 m. From each soil core, 

about 1.5 and 2 kg of soil was collected using the same methodology as described in 

Germon et al. (2018) and Christina et al. (2011b). To avoid contamination of the 

collected soil samples, only soil blocks from the inner part of the auger were 

considered. Total fresh soil mass was measured, and a sub-sample of 5 g was weighed 

in the laboratory to estimate the soil water content by drying the sample at 105°C for 

72 h. Each soil sample was identified and stored at 4°C before being processed a 

maximum of 1 week after sampling. Living roots (i.e. living stele, bright color and 

elasticity) and dead roots (i.e. by sight, touch and flotation) &gt; 1 cm long were carefully 

separated by hand after gentle washing away of the soil with tap water on a sieve with 

a mesh size of 0.5 mm. For the 0-0.2, 0.2-0.5 and 0.5-1 m soil layers, 10 % of the 

weight of each soil sample was used to estimate the mass of extremely fine roots (i.e. 

length &amp;lt;1 cm). For the other soil layers 100% of the weight was considered. Living 

and dead roots more than 1 cm in length were scanned using a double-sided scanning 

procedure at a resolution of 800 dpi. Then, living roots and dead roots over &gt; 1 cm in 

length and fragments of living and dead roots less than 1 cm in length were dried for 

72h at 65° C and weighed (±0.1 mg). For the upper layers where only 10% of the 

weight of the soil was screened for living and dead roots &amp;lt;1 cm in length, the mass of 



119 
 

        
 

fragments was multiplied by 10 to estimate the mass of fragments of the whole soil 

sample. Root weight was then obtained for each soil layer, sampling position, 

treatment and block.  

2.2.9 Root trait calculations 

The fine root scans obtained where analyzed using WinRhizo Version Pro V. 2009c 

software (Régent Instruments Inc., Quebec, Canada) to estimate root lengths and 

areas per soil layer, sampling position, treatments (+W, -W and NH) and blocks. As 

described in Germon et al. (2018) the following metrics were used to estimate fine root 

traits. The specific root length (SRL, m g-1, i.e. total length of scanned roots divided by 

their dry mass) and specific root area (SRA, cm2 g-1, i.e. total area of scanned roots 

divided by their dry mass) were calculated for each soil sample. Fine root mass density 

(g kg-1 soil) was calculated as the total root dry mass divided by the dry weight of the 

soil used for root separation. Fine root density (FRD, g dm-3 soil) was obtained by 

multiplying fine root mass density by the soil bulk densities (measured by the standard 

core method down to a depth of 17 m in each treatment). Fine root biomasses (FRB, 

g m-2) were calculated in each soil layer multiplying the mean fine root density by the 

soil layer volume (dm3). The root area index (RAI, m2 m-2) was calculated as the 

surface area and length of fine roots divided by the sampled soil area respectively. 

FRD, FRB, SRL, SRA, and RAI were obtained for each soil layer from the soil surface 

down to a depth of 17 m, for the sampling position, +W, -W and NH treatments, and 

blocks. 

2.2.10 Statistical analyses 

Linear mixed-effect models were used to test the effect of soil depth, treatment and the 

interaction between depth and treatment on cumulative length production (CLP), root 

elongation rate (RER), daily root elongation rate (DRER), mean root elongation rate 

(MeanRER), maximum root elongation rate (MaxRER), fine root density (FRD), fine 

root biomass (FRB), specific root length (SRL), specific root area (SRA), root area 

index (RAI) and root diameter for the whole soil profile. Blocks were considered as 

random effects and residues were modeled by a first-order autoregressive correlation 

model to account for the correlations between soil depths. Two-way analyses of 

variance (ANOVAs) were used to assess the effect of treatments and blocks for 



120 
 

 
 

individual soil layers on CLP, RER, DRER, MeanRER, MaxRER, FRD, FRB, SRL, 

SRA, RAI and root diameter. Measurements within a given soil layer were considered 

independent, since the sampling positions were located near different trees in each 

treatment and plot. The homogeneity of variances was verified, and log-

transformations were used when the residuals did not follow a normal distribution. 

Tukey’s post-hoc Honest Significant Difference (HSD) was used to determine the 

significant differences between treatments. R software version 3.4.4 (Team R 2013) 

was used for all the calculations and statistical analyses with a 5% significance level. 

The “lmerTest” package was used to perform the linear mixed-effect models 

(Kuznetsova et al., 2017).  

2.3 Results 

2.3.1 Tree growth 

Initial vertical growth was faster in the coppices than in the replanting: nine months 

after harvesting (in February 2011 for the replanting, and February 2017 for the 

coppices), mean tree height was 1.3 m and 1.5 m in the +W and -W replanted plots 

and was 2.7 m and 3.1 m in the +W and -W coppice plots, respectively (Figure 2 - ). 

There were no significant differences in vertical growth between the +W and -W 

treatments for either replanting or coppice in the first 3 years after harvesting.

stands for the replanting (June 2010-June 2016) and the coppice (from June 2016) in 
the undisturbed rainfall plots (+W, blue) and in the plots with 37% of throughfall 
excluded by plastic sheets (-W, orange). Standard errors are shown (shaded area). 

 

2.3.2 Volumetric soil water contents (SWCs) 

In both the +W and -W treatments, rainfall events led to large variations in SWC (Figure 

3 ). At a depth of 0.5 m, SWC ranged from 5.9% to 15.8% in -W and from 7% to 19.4% 

in +W. At a depth of 14 m, SWC ranged from 9.9% to 10.9% in -W and from 11.3% to 

18.1% in +W.  Over the study period, throughfall reduction led to a sharp decrease in 

SWC, on average, by 12.9 ± 4.9% from the topsoil to a depth of 16 m. The design 

turned out to be efficient in mimicking two contrasting rainfall regimes. At the end of 

the rainy season, the mean SWC values of the soil profile in April 2016, i.e. 2 months 

before the clear-cut, were 12.5% and 14.0% in -W and +W, respectively and in April 

2017, i.e. 10 months after the clear-cut, there were 14.4% and 16.2% in -W and +W, 

respectively. After clear-cutting, the soil profiles were recharged with water due to the 



122 
 

 
 

interruption of tree transpiration. In +W, the gravitational soil solutions reached a depth 

of 16 m only 10 months after clear-cutting, while in -W they reached a maximum depth 

of only 12 m 13 months after clear-cutting. Gravitational soil solutions did not reach the 

water table in -W over the study period (one year before the clear-cut and the first 2 

years of coppice management).  

2.3.3 Fine root length production  

The highest cumulative root length production (CLP) over the study period was at 

depths &gt; 4 m, in both +W and -W (Figure 4 ). In –W, CLP reached about 19 m m-2 at a 

depth of 13.5-14.8 m, and only 3.9 m m-2 in the upper 2.3 m of the soil profile. In +W, 

the highest CLP was found in an intermediate soil layer (5.5-6.8 m deep) with a CLP 

of 18.9 m m-2. CLP reached about 12 m m-2 in very deep soil layers (13.5-14.8 m deep) 

and only about 2 m m-2 in the upper 2.3 m of the soil profile in +W.

the NH stand, where only the first three layers (0-1.3 m, 1-2.3 m and 3.5-4.5 m) were sampled.

plot (NH, C). Standard errors are shown (shaded area). The clear-cut date is indicated by a vertical line. The stands were coppice-
managed after clear-cutting in +W and -W. The monitoring of DRER started in May 2015 in the +W and -W plots, and in March 2016 
in the NH stand, where only the first three layers (0-1.3 m, 1-2.3 m and 3.5-4.5 m) were sampled. 



128 
 

 
 

2.3.4 Fine root elongation rates 

Daily root elongation rates (DRERs) were highly variable between the soil layer and 

the season, in both +W and -W (Figure 5 ). Fine root growth started in the top soil after 

the clear-cut and occurred more and more deeply over time in +W and -W. The 

intensity (measured as the maximum DRER) and the period of fine root growth differed 

depending on soil depth. DRER measured during flushes of root growth was much 

lower in the topsoil than at great depth in +W, -W and NH (no observation below 4.8 m 

in NH). At a depth of 3.5-4.8 m, flushes of DRER in NH came earlier than in clear-cut 

plots. In the coppices, the first flush of DRER occurred about 6 months after clear-

cutting in the topsoil, 12 months after clear-cutting in the 3.5-4.8 m soil layer and 16 

months after clear-cutting in the 13.5-14.8 m soil layer, in both +W and -W. Moreover, 

DRER sharply increased in the 15.5-16.8 m layer of +W 18 months after clear-cutting.  

DRER peaks ranged from 1.5 cm m-2 day-1 in the topsoil to 94.7 cm m-2 day-1 at a depth 

of about 12 m in +W, and from 3.5 cm m-2 day-1 in the topsoil to 83.7 cm m-2 day-1 at a 

depth of about 14 m in -W. The maximum elongation rate of individual roots (MaxRER) 

reached 4.3 cm day-1 in -W and 3.0 cm day-1 in +W (Table 1) and was much higher at 

great depths than in the topsoil (data not shown). DRER values peaked at the end of 

the dry season in all the soil layers at depths &gt; 6 m when SWC decreased in the upper 

soil layers (Figure 3 , Figure 5 ). Thus, DRER values were not necessarily correlated 

with soil water contents for a given soil layer. A synchrony between the decrease in 

cumulated extractable water in the topsoil and DRER peaks was observed in -W 

(Figure 6 ) after the clear-cut. Successive DRER peaks appeared more and more 

deeply at the end of the dry season when the extractable water stocks in the 0-2 m 

layer fell below about 80 mm.

2.3.5 Fine root distributions 

Auger sampling carried out on the same date in the NH plot and in the +W and -W 

coppices 1.5 years after clear-cutting showed a similar pattern of deep rooting, 

whatever the treatment (Figure 7). Fine root densities dropped below a depth of 20 cm, 

then decreased gradually down to the water table in NH, +W and -W. Fine roots where 

found down to 17 m in all treatments. Total fine root biomass down to a depth of 17 m 

was 1,078 g m-2 in NH, 1,017 ± 301 g m-2 in +W and 1,266 ± 363 g m-2 in -W (Table 

2). Fine root densities were about 25% higher in -W than in +W and NH in most of the 

soil layers. At depths &gt; 7 m, fine root densities were at least twice as high in -W as in 

+W and NH.

Standard deviations are indicated. Different lower-case letters indicate significant 
differences between treatments +W and -W (p &amp;lt;0.05). NH was not included in 
statistical analyses because the three soil coring replicates were located in the same 
plot. 

 

 

2.3.6 Fine root traits 

The total root area index (RAI) was significantly higher in –W (32.8 m2 m-2) than in +W 

(26.5 m2 m-2) (Figure 8 ). Similar RAI values in the NH stand (26.8 m2 m-2) and in the 

+W coppice suggested that the effect of clear-cutting on fine root dynamics was low, 

in agreement with elongation and mortality rates observed in the upper 4 m on 

minirhizotron tubes. RAI in the 0-1 m surface soil layer accounted for only one third of 

the total RAI down to the water table in NH, +W and -W (about 11 m2 m-2 on average). 

Significant differences between +W and -W were found at depths &gt; 5 m (Figure 8 ). In 

the 5-10 m soil layers, RAI was 5.0 m2 m-2 in -W and 2.8 m2 m-2 in +W. At depths &gt; 10 

m, RAI was 3.2 m2 m-2 in -W and only 0.4 m2 m-2 in +W. 

In the NH, +W and -W treatments, depth had little effect on specific root length (SRL), 

specific root area (SRA) and fine root diameter (data not shown). SRL and SRA were 

significantly higher in -W than in +W, and similar values were observed in +W and NH, 

although the sampling in NH (pseudo-replication on one block) did not allow a 

confirmation with statistics (Table 2). Down to a depth of 17 m, mean SRL values were 

28.8, 30.6 and 34.4 m g-1, mean SRA values were 258.8, 267.5 and 305.3 cm2 g-1, and

mean fine root diameters were 0.31, 0.32 and 0.36 mm in NH, +W and -W, respectively 

(Table 2).

throughfall excluded by plastic sheets (-W) and in the non-harvested plot (NH). 
Different upper-case letters indicate significant differences between treatments for the 
cumulative indices and different lower-case letters indicate significant differences 
between treatments within each individual soil layer (p &amp;lt;0.05). NH was not included in 
the ANOVA because the three soil coring replicates were located in the same plot. 

2.3.7 Fine root mortality 

Cumulative dead root length in the minirhizotron images over the study period of 3 

years across all soil layers accounted for only 6-7% of cumulative root length 

production, in both +W and -W (Table 1). Surprisingly, dead fine root length did not 

increase after clear-cutting and did not differ between depths and between the +W and 

-W treatments. Dead fine root mass estimated 1.5 years after clear-cutting amounted 

to 163.2 g m-2 in +W and 167.9 g m-2 in -W (Table 2). 



134 
 

 
 

2.4 Discussion 

The main novelty of our results lies in the first direct observation of fine root phenology 

at depths of more than 10 m and derived knowledge raised from a comparison between 

the treatments. The consequences of tree harvesting on fine root dynamics in coppice-

managed plantations raise specific questions never studied before along a deep 

tropical soil profile. Since the 1980s, the minirhizotron technique has been widely used 

to study fine root dynamics and turnover (Graefe et al., 2008; Maeght et al., 2013). 

Many studies have shown that the soil environment close to minirhizotrons can be 

modified relative to undisturbed soil (Majdi &amp;amp; Nylund, 1996), which is likely to influence 

fine root dynamics. However, in our study the very low root mortality rates after clear-

cutting revealed by minirhizotron monitoring was consistent with the small amounts of 

dead fine roots measured by soil coring. Despite some unavoidable limitations, direct 

observations from minirhizotron tubes or field rhizotrons is for now the most accurate 

way of studying fine root phenology in situ (Dipesh  &amp;amp; Schuler, 2013; Radville et al., 

2016a). 

2.4.1 Root behavior in response to drought 

The main purpose of our study was to investigate whether fine roots explore very deep 

soil layers and do so more intensively when trees are subjected to prolonged drought 

periods. This study, carried out in a throughfall exclusion experiment and including a 

non-harvested plot, made it possible to assess the effect of clear-cutting under two 

contrasting rainfall regimes. In agreement with our first hypothesis, Eucalyptus trees 

responded to drought by increasing fine root densities at great depth. Previous studies 

in Brazil showed that Eucalyptus trees have the ability to explore very deep layers in 

soils without hindrance to root growth (Christina et al., 2011b; Pinheiro et al., 2016b). 

In a survey of 62 tropical tree species, Markesteijn and Poorter (2009) showed that 

trees increase belowground biomass and the proportion of deep roots in response to 

dry conditions. Root growth in deep soil layers can increase the amount of water 

available to sustain tree growth, which could be a key advantage for eucalypt trees in 

coping with severe drought events (Christina et al., 2017b).   

After clear-cutting, fine root growth at more than 4 m deep was spectacular at the end 

of the dry season, whatever the water supply regime. Lambais et al. (2017) also 



135 
 

 

showed flushes of fine root growth down to a depth of 6 m at the end of dry periods in 

a Brazilian eucalypt plantation. Fine root growth in deep soil layers was initiated when 

the extractable water content in the 0-2 m soil layer fell below a threshold of about 80 

mm, which suggests that soil water content in a particular soil layer was not the main 

driver of fine root growth. Endogenous and exogenous factors are major drivers of fine 

root phenology (Abramoff &amp;amp; Finzi, 2015; Moroni et al., 2003; Tierney et al., 2003), but 

are difficult to disentangle in deep soil layers. The successive flushes of fine root 

growth from the topsoil to the deepest soil layers at the end of the dry season and the 

first months after the onset of the rainy season in +W and -W might have resulted from 

a rapid exhaustion of water resources in the topsoil, inducing tree roots to grow deeper 

in the soil (Billings, 2015; Schenk &amp;amp; Jackson, 2002). Furthermore, a strong increase in 

sugar sap concentration and sugar allocation belowground has been shown in forests 

during dry periods (Pate &amp;amp; Arthur, 1998; Scartazza et al., 2015), which could be a 

physiological response to a rapid exhaustion of water in the top soil and could help to 

explain the root growth in deep soil layers at the end of dry periods in our study.  

In agreement with our second hypothesis, Eucalyptus trees facing drought adapted 

their root morphology to maximize the root surface area to take up limited resources. 

SRL and SRA were higher in –W than in +W, which in combination with higher fine root 

densities led to a much higher root area index. In a meta-analysis, Ostonen et al. 

(2007b) showed that SRL response to drought varies greatly between species. While 

Arend et al. (2011) did not observe any significant change in SRL, root area index and 

root tissue density for oak trees (Quercus sp.) exposed to drought, Olmo et al. (2014) 

showed an increase in SRL and root tissue density under drought conditions for 10 

tree species. Eucalyptus grandis trees coped with drought in our experiment by 

increasing their capacity to take up soil resources for a relatively low investment in 

belowground biomass. A large increase in SRL and SRA was recently shown 

throughout deep soil profiles down to 17 m deep for Acacia mangium Wild and E. 

grandis roots in response to the mixture relative to monospecific stands (Germon et 

al., 2018). Our study showed that Eucalyptus trees can modify fine root traits to 

enhance resource capture and the exploration of very deep soil layers to survive in a 

context of climate change, which contributes to maintaining water uptake during dry 

periods (Brunner et al., 2015; Christina et al., 2017b).  

 



136 
 

 
 

2.4.2 Key role of deep roots in coppice management 

Contrary to our fourth hypothesis, relatively few roots were lost by mortality (&amp;lt;10% out 

of all the roots observed over 3 years), which suggested that most of the root system 

remained functional after clear-cutting. The effect of clear-cutting on fine root mortality 

remains unclear in coppice-managed forest plantations. Unlike our observations, 

sequential coring in the 0-1 m soil layer showed a decrease in fine root density after 

harvesting coppice-managed E. grandis stands in Brazil (Mello et al., 2007). Wildy and 

Pate (2002) also showed high fine root mortality rates after cutting the trees in 

plantations of Eucalyptus kochii Maiden &amp;amp; Blakely subsp. plenissima Gardner 

(Brooker), but the root system superstructure was sustained down to a depth of at least 

4 m. Teixeira et al. (2002) showed from sequential coring in the 0-0.6 m soil layer that 

fine-, medium- and coarse-root biomasses increased over time after harvesting 

coppice-managed Eucalyptus urophylla S. T. Blake trees. Using the minirhizotron 

technique, Dickmann et al. (1996) showed an absence of root mortality for coppice-

managed poplar clones. Our study suggested that 6-year-old Eucalyptus grandis trees 

have enough reserves within the root system and the appropriate edaphic surrounding 

conditions to maintain the fine root biomass established down to the water table after 

clear-cutting, which probably contributed to promoting early shoot growth (Brunner et 

al., 2015; Drake et al., 2013).  

Fine root growth after clear-cutting started in the topsoil, then continued successively 

in deeper and deeper soil layers, which confirmed our third hypothesis, even though 

the lapse of several months after clear-cutting was not expected. This pattern might 

have resulted from high nutrient and water availabilities in the upper layers after 

harvesting Eucalyptus stands due to an interruption of tree water uptake and fertilizer 

application (Laclau et al., 2010). The asynchrony within the root system, delaying root 

growth in deep soil layers, might be a strategy for maximizing the water and nutrient 

uptake needed to meet the high demand of these fast-growing trees. Root growth 

occurred at a depth of 14 m less than one year after clear-cutting of coppice-managed 

E. grandis trees, while the maximum depth reached by E. grandis roots one year after 

planting is about 7 m in very deep soils (Christina et al., 2011b; Laclau et al., 2013a). 

Deep roots can provide access to large amounts of water stored in the subsoil after 

clear-cutting and small fine root densities in deep soil layers can be sufficient to take 



137 
 

 

up substantial amounts of water (Christina et al., 2017b). Low fine root mortality rates 

after clear-cutting suggest that coppice-management of Eucalyptus plantations might 

be a promising option for coping with water scarcity, since the pre-existing root system 

can provide access to water stored throughout deep soil profiles.  

 

2.4.3 Carbon sequestration and implication for the management of eucalypt 

plantations  

Surprisingly, cutting the trees did not lead to an increase in root mortality throughout 

the soil profile, whatever the water supply regime. Fine roots play an active role in 

carbon (C) cycling in forest ecosystems, through respiratory processes, exudation and 

root mortality (Balesdent &amp;amp; Balabane, 1996; Marsden et al., 2008; Strand et al., 2008). 

The consequences of deep rooting on subsoil C stocks in tropical planted forests and 

other forest ecosystems remain poorly known (Gao et al., 2018; Harper &amp;amp; Tibbett, 

2013; Meyer et al., 2018; Nepstad et al., 1994). On the one hand, the supply of fresh 

carbon might promote the activity of microbes and affect the stability of pre-existing 

organic matter through a “priming effect” (Derrien et al., 2014a; Fontaine et al., 2007; 

Kuzyakov et al., 2000). Promoting the mineralization of ancient C would result in high 

emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) under aerobic conditions and of methane (CH4) 

under anaerobic conditions. However, a complementary study in our plots showed that 

CO2 and CH4 emissions did not increase significantly after clear-cutting in the coppice-

managed stands compared to the non-harvested stand (Germon et al. in prep.). Gas 

emission rates after clear-cutting in our experiment were therefore consistent with the 

low rates of root mortality observed. On the other hand, deep roots might also 

contribute to sequestrating large amounts of C in soil. Total below-ground carbon 

allocations account for about 20-30% of gross primary production in Eucalyptus 

plantations (Epron et al., 2012; Nouvellon et al., 2012a; Ryan et al., 2010). Fine root 

elongation rates were higher at great depth compared to the topsoil, with an increase 

in fine root density after the clear-cut in very deep horizons. Moreover, microbial 

biomass is lower in deep soil layers than in the topsoil, which in combination with 

oxygen limitations could enhance C sequestration as a result of low mineralization 

rates (Rumpel &amp;amp; Kögel-Knabner, 2011; Taylor et al., 2002). C from roots is generally 

retained more in the soil than C from aboveground litter, which is more affected by 



138 
 

 
 

physicochemical processes and also due to structural composition differences 

between leaves and roots (Menichetti et al., 2015; Rasse et al., 2005; Schmidt et al., 

2011). Further studies are needed to assess whether the management of Eucalyptus 

plantations in very deep soils could be an effective option to help mitigate the increase 

in CO2 in the atmosphere.  

2.5 Conclusions 

The fine root phenology of coppice-managed Eucalyptus trees under contrasting water 

supply regimes revealed unexpected low rates of root mortality. The early growth of 

the sprouts after cutting the trees benefited from the root system established over the 

previous rotation cycle, and the asynchrony of fine root growth depending on depth 

highlighted tree plasticity in response to soil conditions. Establishing deep root systems 

in tropical planted forests could help trees withstand the long drought periods expected 

under climate change in many tropical regions. Our study suggested that coppice 

management might be an interesting option in tropical Eucalyptus plantations, both to 

improve tree tolerance to drought and store carbon at great depth in the soil.

CHAPTER 3 - CONSEQUENCES OF CLEAR-CUTTING AND DROUGHT ON 

CO2, CH4 AND N2O PRODUCTIONS THROUGHOUT DEEP SOIL PROFILES IN 

COPPICE-MANAGED EUCALYPT PLANTATIONS 

 

We saw in chapter 2 that harvesting did not lead to an increase in root mortality in the 

stands coppice-managed, whatever the water supply regime. Fine root biomass and 

root area index increased about 25 and 24 % respectively in the throughfall exclusion 

plot compared to the control plot down to a depth of 17 m. The changes in root 

distribution occurred mainly at depth &gt; 7m. Therefore, the huge soil volume explored 

by fine roots might lead to significant CO2, N2O and CH4 productions within the entire 

rooting soil profile. A deeper root system could increase greenhouse gases emissions 

through an increase in production, respiration, exudation and decomposition 

processes. 

The central objective of this following chapter is to assess the effect of clear-cutting 

and drought on greenhouse gases production throughout deep soil profiles down to 

the water table in coppice-managed Brazilian eucalypt plantations. These effects were 

monitored before and after trees harvest in a coppice-managed Eucalyptus grandis 

plantation under two contrasting water supply regimes.  

This chapter presents the results of 1.8 years of greenhouse gases monitoring and is 

titled is “Consequences of clear-cutting and drought on CO2, CH4 and N2O productions 

throughout deep soil profiles in coppice-managed eucalypt plantations”. Co-authors

Abstract  

The major factors driving greenhouse gas exchanges in forest soils (substrate supply, 

temperature, water content) can vary considerably with depth. Our study aimed to 

assess the effects of clear-cutting and drought on the temporal variability of CO2, CH4 

and N2O fluxes throughout very deep soil profiles in Brazilian coppice-managed 

eucalypt plantations. CO2, CH4 and N2O surface effluxes at soil surface were 

measured over three years using the closed-chamber method in a throughfall 

exclusion experiment comparing stands with 37% of throughfall exclusion (-W) and 

stands without rain exclusion (+W). CO2, CH4 and N2O concentrations in the soil were 

measured from two permanent pits down to a depth of 15.5 m in -W and +W, as well 

as down to a depth of 4 m in a non-harvested control plot (NH). Measurements were 

carried out every 2 weeks over 3 months before clear-cutting, then over 19 months in 

coppice. CO2, CH4 and N2O effluxes were not significantly different between -W and 

+W and did not change after clear-cutting in the coppice-managed stands compared 

to non-harvested stand. CO2 and CH4 concentrations greatly increased with depth and 

N2O concentrations remained roughly constant from the soil surface down to a depth 

of 15.5 m. Mean CO2 and N2O concentrations in -W were 20.7% and 7.6% lower than 

in +W, respectively, and CH4 concentrations in -W where 44.4% higher than in +W 

throughout the soil profiles. A diffusivity model showed that CO2, N2O and CH4 

production and consumption occurred at great depths and were similar in +W, -W and 

NH plots. Clear-cutting did not increase CO2, CH4 and N2O effluxes and productions, 

whatever the water supply regime. Our study suggests that the consequences of 

changes in rainfall regimes and silvicultural practices on greenhouse gas emissions 

could be minor in tropical eucalypt plantations.

3.1 Introduction  

Climate changes are expected to increase the contrast between dry and wet seasons 

in tropical and subtropical regions (Dai, 2011; He &amp;amp; Soden, 2017; Solomon et al., 

2009). Climate models predict longer and more severe seasonal droughts in the future, 

as well as more frequent extreme rainfall events during rainy seasons (Chen et al., 

2017). Changes in precipitation regimes may also have important feedback effects on 

climate through a modification of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous 

oxide (N2O) fluxes in forest soils (Davidson et al., 2004; Hashimoto et al., 2007). 

Understanding how precipitation changes, and especially extended drought periods, 

influence greenhouse gas effluxes in forest soils is crucial to improve the prediction of 

terrestrial biosphere models.  

The balance between production and consumption of CO2, CH4 and N2O in forest soils 

can be greatly affected by precipitation changes (Davidson et al., 2000b). Throughfall 

exclusion in tropical and subtropical forests has either decreased (Cleveland et al., 

2010) or increased (Van Straaten et al., 2011; Wood &amp;amp; Silver, 2012) soil CO2 

emissions, either increased consumption (Wood &amp;amp; Silver, 2012) and production 

(Cattânio et al., 2002) of CH4 and either lowered (Davidson et al., 2004) and increased 

(Cattânio et al., 2002) soil N2O emissions. An increase in soil water contents inhibits 

gas diffusion within soil profiles to the atmosphere as well as microbial production and 

consumption of greenhouse gases (Qi et al., 2018; Sotta et al., 2007). Root:shoot ratios 

generally increase in response to dry conditions as well as the proportion of deep roots 

(Germon et al., 2019; Markesteijn &amp;amp; Poorter, 2009), which can increase CO2 production 

due to higher root respiration.  

Production of greenhouse gases by soil microorganisms and roots can change rapidly 

temporally and spatially, which makes modelling efforts challenging (Courtois et al., 

2018; Drewitt et al., 2005). While most studies dealing with soil greenhouse gases 

effluxes address the spatial and temporal variations, the vertical distribution of soil 

respiration is little documented in very deep soils (Drewitt et al., 2005). Trees with roots 

at depths of more than 10 m are common in tropical forests (Broedel et al., 2017; 

Nepstad et al., 1994; Saleska et al., 2007). In a Brazilian Amazon forest, the 

consumption of CH4 occurred mainly in the upper 10 cm, the production of N2O mainly 

in the 0-25 cm soil layer whereas CO2 was produced down to at least a depth of 11 m 



157 
 

 

(Davidson et al., 2004) . In another Amazonian forest, CO2 production in the 0.5-3 m 

soil layer accounted for 17 % of the total soil CO2 production (Sotta et al., 2007). Even 

if microbial activity is low in deep soil layers (Fontaine et al., 2007), the huge soil 

volume explored by fine roots might lead to non-neglectable CO2, N2O and CH4 

productions.  

Fast-growing Eucalyptus plantations cover more than 20 million hectares  and are 

expanding rapidly to produced raw material for the industry (paper, wood panels, and 

biofuel) as well as firewood and charcoal in developing countries (Booth, 2013). In 

Brazil, Eucalyptus plantations cover about 5.6 million hectares and are mainly 

established on deep soils with low fertility and many plantation areas are subjected to 

prolonged drought periods (Keenan et al., 2015). The management of Eucalyptus 

plantations through coppice has been practiced by forestry companies due to lower 

production costs, shorter rotations and faster financial returns compared to replanted 

stands (Gonçalves et al., 2013). The root system established during previous rotations 

makes possible a rapid regrowth from the stump after harvesting. Eucalyptus fine roots 

can explore rapidly after planting both the superficial soil layers and very deep soil 

horizons (Germon et al., 2019; Laclau et al., 2013) and allocate about 30% of the gross 

primary productivity belowground, for root growth, root respiration and C exudation 

(Epron et al., 2012; Nouvellon et al., 2012; Ryan et al., 2010). Coppice management 

constitutes an advantage over sites with pronounced stress conditions, as the 

established root system preserves carbon for the next generation. However, removing 

the aboveground parts of trees has a great impact on carbon balance and greenhouses 

gases emissions of the ecosystem. Clear-cutting  increases the solar radiation 

transmitted to the soil, raising the soil temperature and soil water contents through an 

interruption of stand transpiration (Londo et al., 1999; Mello et al., 2007). This may 

induce an increase in microbial activity, the decomposition of harvest residues left at 

the soil surface and enhance fine root mortality and decomposition (Mello et al., 2007; 

Parfitt et al., 2001).As far as we know, concentrations of greenhouse gas in deep soil 

layers have never been quantified in tropical planted forests in response to throughfall 

exclusion and coppice management. 

Our study aimed to assess the consequences of contrasting rainfall regimes on CO2, 

CH4 and N2O fluxes throughout very deep tropical soils in coppice-managed 

Eucalyptus grandis (Hill ex. Maid) stands after clear-cutting. We put forward three 



158 
 

 
 

hypotheses: (H1) throughfall exclusion lower soil water contents, which increases gas 

diffusivity and modify greenhouse gases production and consumption, (H2) throughfall 

exclusion increases the partition of C to deep roots, which increases the production of 

CO2 in deep soil layers, and (H3) fine root mortality and slash decomposition after 

harvesting Eucalyptus grandis trees managed in coppice increase substrate availability 

for microbes throughout the soil profile, which increases CO2, CH4 and N2O effluxes at 

soil surface.  

3.2 Materials and Methods 

3.2.1 Study site 

Our study was carried out at the research station owned by the Luiz de Quieroz College 

of Agriculture (ESALQ) near Itatinga (São Paulo state, Brazil, 23°02?S 48°38?W), at an 

altitude of 850 m. The relief is typical of the São Paulo Western Plateau, with a 

topography varying from flat to hilly (slopes &amp;lt;3%). The soils are very deep Ferralsols 

according to the ISS Working Group WRB (2015) developed on Cretaceous 

sandstone. Clay contents range from 160 mg g-1 in the topsoil to about 250 mg g-1 at 

a depth of 15 m (Christina et al., 2015). The local climate is humid subtropical (Cwa 

according to the Köppen classification) with a rainy season from October to May and 

a dry and slightly cold season from June to September. Over the last 15 years, the 

mean air temperature was 20°C, the relative humidity was 77% and the mean annual 

precipitation was 1390 mm.  

3.2.2 Experimental Layout 

A split-splot experimental design was installed on 2 hectares in June 2010, with the 

planting of a Eucalyptus grandis clone used in commercial plantations (Suzano 

Company). Three fertilization regimes and two rainfall regimes were compared in 3 

blocks to gain insight into the interaction between tree nutrition and water availability 

on tree functioning (Battie?Laclau et al., 2014a; Christina et al., 2015; Christina et al., 

2018; Ployet et al., 2019). The experimental layout was described in detail in Battie?

Laclau et al. (2014b). Each plot was made of 144 trees (12 rows with 12 trees per row, 

spacing 3 x 2 m) and each experimental unit consisted of 36 trees (excluding 3 buffer 



159 
 

 

rows to avoid bordure effect). We studied two treatments out of the 6 treatments in the 

experimental design as well as a non-harvested control plot in the same stand: 

• -W: plots were equipped with plastic sheets in September 2010 to exclude 37% 

of throughfall and fertilizers were applied to avoid any nutritional limitation of 

tree growth. 

• +W: undisturbed rainfall and same fertilization as in -W plots 

• NH: undisturbed rainfall and same fertilization as in -W and +W plots. Contrary 

to -W and +W, the trees were not harvested in June 2016. 

Trees were planted in June 2010 and received at planting 3.3 g P m-2 and 200 g m-2 of 

dolomitic lime and trace elements. At 3 months of age, 0.45 mol K m-2 were applied as 

KCl and 12 g N m-2. These fertilizers inputs are not limiting for the tree growth (Laclau 

et al., 2009). Herbicides were applied to avoid the presence of understory species. The 

Eucalyptus stands were harvested six years after planting, in June 2016, and coppice-

managed thereafter. Several new shoots were regenerated from the stumps after the 

clear-cut and 1 or 2 shoots per stump were selected to maintain the same stocking 

density and prevent the growth of additional new shoots.  

3.2.3 Soil water monitoring and soil bulk density 

Between February and March 2014, two deep permanent pits were excavated in the 

+W and -W treatments to set up sensors and to measure soil properties from the top 

soil down to the water table (Germon et al., 2019). The volumetric soil water content 

(SWC, m3 water m-3 soil) was monitored through the study period at half-hourly 

intervals using CS616 probes (Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT, USA). Probes were 

installed in the +W and -W treatments at a depth of 0.15, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 

14 and 16 m, with 3 probes at each depth in block 1. Soil bulk densities were measured 

by the standard core method down to a depth of 17 m in the +W and -W treatments. 

The total porosity was calculated from bulk density: 

????? ???????? = 1 ?
??

??
 

where BD is measured bulk density and PD is an assumed particle density of 2.65 g 

cm-3 (Davidson et al., 2006; Oerter et al., 2018; Sotta et al., 2007). The soil water 

content was expressed as the percentage of water filled pore space (WFPS, %) and 



160 
 

 
 

was calculated for each depth as the volumetric water content (SWC) divided by the 

total porosity. 

3.2.4 Gas sampling at the soil surface 

Soil CO2 efflux was monitored in the +W and -W treatments using a dynamic closed-

path Li8100 system equipped with a 20 cm diameter Li8100-103 respiration chamber 

(LiCor Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). 54 PVC collars (9 per plot in treatments +W and -W 

and 3 blocks) were installed in May 2010 to sample different distances from the tree 

(Figure 1 ), using the methodology described in Nouvellon et al. (2008). Soil CO2 efflux 

was measured every 14 days over 3 years from December 2014 to December 2017, 

which represented 1.5 year before the clear-cut and 1.5 year after the clear-cut. In 

October 2016, 27 PVC collars were installed in the NH treatment to measure soil CO2 

efflux from November 2016 to December 2017. 

Soil CO2, N2O and CH4 fluxes were measured simultaneously to the Li8100 

measurements in the same plots. Chamber (diameter 40 cm, height 10 cm) collars 

were permanently set up in the +W, -W and NH plots (Metay et al., 2007). Four anchors 

were placed randomly in each plot at four distance from the trees, one month before 

the beginning of greenhouse gas efflux measurements (Figure 1 ). Anchors were 

temporarily removed during stand harvest, then they were returned to the same 

location. Measurements were made every 14 days over one year from March 2015 to 

March 2016, then once a month between April 2016 and December 2017. Soil CO2, 

N2O and CH4 fluxes were monitored over 3 months before the clear-cut and over 19 

months after the clear-cut in the coppice-managed treatments +W and -W, as well as 

over 22 months in the NH treatment. The chamber atmosphere was sampled 4 

consecutive times (0, 10 min, 20 min and 30 min after closure) during this period with 

5 mL syringes previously purged.  

Gas samples were analyzed using electron capture gas chromatography (CPG-ECD, 

at the Plant Production Department - FCA, UNESP, Botucatu, Brazil). Gas samples 

were analyzed in less than 36 hours after sampling (the validity of this period was 

verified in a preliminary study). Concentrations of CO2, N2O and CH4 in soil air were 

calculated by comparison of integrated peak areas of samples with standard gases, 



161 
 

 

which were used to make a four-point calibration. Calibration was done for each 

sampling date. More than 4000 gas samples have been analyzed in our study. 

Gas fluxes at the soil surface were calculated from the following equation: 

?? =  
?[???]

??
×

1

?

??

??
 

where Fs is gas flux (µmol m-2 s-1 or nmol m-2 s-1), 
?[???]

??
 is the slope of the regression 

line of gas concentrations (ppm or ppb) over time (s), S is the chamber surface (m2), 

V the chamber volume (m3), P the atmospheric pressure (Pa), R the perfect gas 

constant (8.3143 J K-1 mol-1) and T the temperature (K). 

Cumulative soil CO2, N2O and CH4 fluxes were estimated for each PVC collar and each 

chamber using linear interpolations of fluxes between each measurement date for all 

treatments.  Gana et al. (2018) checked in a nearby eucalypt stand the validity of this 

method for CO2 effluxes in comparison with monitoring every hour using automatic Li-

cor chambers. Annual estimates of gas fluxes were made for each individual flux 

chamber.     

 

3.2.5 Gas sampling at different soil depths 

The permanent pits in the +W and -W treatments were 1.5 m in diameter and reached 

a depth of 17 m (Figure 1 ). They were maintained by concrete rings to reduce potential 

soil collapse and disturbances of the soil system. To prevent light and rain entering the 

pits, clear-colored roofs of the same diameter as the pits were used. Platforms were 

set up at two-meter intervals in the pits, equipped with artificial lighting and fans used 

during working sessions, allowing access and safe work down to the water table 

(Germon et al., 2019). The high cost of opening and securing these pits prevented 

further replications in the other two blocks. However, other measurements, including 

CO2, N2O and CH4 effluxes, were made in the three blocks, making it possible to 

extrapolate some of the observations made in the two deep pits. In October 2015, a 

third pit was excavated in the non-harvested treatment (NH) down to a depth of 3.5 m 

to study the clear-cut effect. 



162 
 

 
 

Soil CO2, N2O and CH4 concentrations were measured at a depth of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 3.5, 

7.5, 11.5 and 15.5 m (3 repetitions per depth, Figure 1 ) in the +W and -W treatments 

and at 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 and 3.5 m depths (3 repetitions per depth) in the NH treatment. 

Soil-gas samples were collected using a passive method: a 20 mL syringe was driven 

into the ground at 1.2 m from the lateral pit wall for each sampling depth (to be sure to 

sample an undisturbed soil area) and remained permanently in the soil throughout the 

study period (Chapuis-Lardy et al., 2009; Metay et al., 2007). Additional 1 m deep pits 

(3 per treatment in +W, -W and NH) were excavated to collect soil-gas samples at 

depths of 0.1, 0.5 and 1 m to increase the number of replications in the top meter, and 

then backfilled with soil horizons in their correct order. Soil gas was pumped from the 

inside of the pit (for permanent deep pits) or from the soil surface into a 5 mL syringe 

(after several “micropurge” to prevent gas sample from contamination). This equipment 

was installed into the soil more than one month prior to the first soil gas measurement 

to allow for passive diffusion from the soil into the syringe. Soil CO2, N2O and CH4 

concentrations were measured on the same days as CO2, N2O and CH4 effluxes at the 

soil surface from March 2016 to December 2017: over 3 months before clear-cutting 

and 19 months after the clear-cut in the coppice-managed +W and -W treatments and 

over 22 months in the NH treatment.

depth). The same set-up was used in the -W treatment.  The photographs show a view from the bottom of each pit, the top of one pit 
and the tube used to sample soil gas.

3.2.6 Modeling effective diffusivity of CO2, N2O and CH4 1 

Gas production at each depth was calculated as the difference between the flux across 2 

soil layers (Risk et al., 2002). To estimate soil gas fluxes within the soil profile we used 3 

CO2, N2O and CH4 concentrations, soil physical properties and soil textural properties. 4 

Interlayer flux was determined from Fick’s Lax in one dimension. 5 

?(???) = ??? 
??

??

where Ds is the gas diffusivity in the soil, C is the concentration and z is the depth. This 7 

approach assumes that the concentration profile is momentarily at steady state. This 8 

model provides an estimate of the production that occurred below the depth of the 9 

calculated flux. The flux rates from soil gas concentrations depend on the soil gas 10 

diffusion coefficient. Effective diffusivity was estimated using the model of Moldrup et 11 

al. (1999), recommended for soils with clay contents &amp;lt;30%: 12

where Do is the diffusivity of gas in air assumed to be 0.138, 0.144 and 0.195 cm2 s-1 14 

for CO2, N2O and CH4, respectively, according to Massman (1998),  is air-filled 15 

porosity and ? is the total porosity (Moldrup et al., 1999; Oerter et al., 2018). Air-filled 16 

porosity was calculated by difference between total porosity and soil volumetric water 17 

content at each depth.     18 

3.2.7 Statistical analyses  19 

Linear mixed-effect models were used to test the effects of soil depth, treatment (+W 20 

and -W) and the interaction between depth and treatment on CO2, N2O and CH4 21 

concentrations in soil air, as well as CO2, N2O and CH4 productions for the whole soil 22 

profile at each measurement date. Blocks were considered as random effects and 23 

residues were modelled by a first-order autoregressive correlation model to account 24 

for the correlations between soil depths. Two-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) 25 

were used to assess the effect of treatments (+W, -W and NH) for individual soil layers 26 

on CO2, N2O and CH4 soil concentrations. CO2, N2O and CH4 fluxes at the soil surface 27 

were tested for statistical significance at each measurement date. The same analysis 28 



165 
 

 

was made for cumulative CO2, N2O and CH4 fluxes over the study period. The 29 

homogeneity of variances was verified, and log-transformation were used when the 30 

residuals did not follow a normal distribution. Tuckey’s post-hoc Honest Significant 31 

Difference (HSD) were used to determine the significant differences between 32 

treatments. Linear regressions were used to identify the correlation between CO2 33 

production and root biomass as well as soil CO2 effluxes measured with the closed 34 

chamber method and the close-path Li8100 system. R software version 3.4.4 (Team 35 

R 2013) was used for all the calculations and statistical analyses with a level of 36 

significance of 5%. The lmerTest package was used to perform the linear mixed-effect 37 

models (Kuznetsova et al., 2017). 38 

3.3 Results 39 

3.3.1 Water filled pore space (WFPS) 40 

WFPS values throughout the soil profiles were strongly influenced by throughfall 41 

exclusion and reflected the distribution of rainfall events (Figure 2 ). Mean WFPS from 42 

March 2016 to December 2017 was 38.5 ± 12.7 % in the +W treatment and 31.7 ± 8.5 43 

% in the -W treatment. At a depth of 0.5 m, WFPS ranged from 15.6% to 41.1% in the 44 

+W treatment and from 14.0% to 34.0% in the -W treatment. At a depth of 14 m, WFPS 45 

ranged from 34.7% to 53.7% in treatment +W and from 28.5% to 30.9% in treatment -46 

W. At the end of the rainy season, mean WFPS in the 0-14 m soil layer were 37.9% 47 

and 30.7% in the +W and -W treatments, just before the clear-cut (June 2016), 48 

respectively, and 42.1% and 36.1%, 1 year after the clear-cut (June 2017). The soil 49 

profiles were refilled with water after the clear-cut as a result of an interruption in tree 50 

transpiration in coppice-managed stands. Water contents were lower in the -W 51 

treatment than in the +W treatment before the clear-cut and the difference between the 52 

two treatments persisted over the first 1.5 year after the clear-cut.53

3.3.2 CO2, N2O and CH4 effluxes at the soil surface  

Soil CO2 effluxes measured with the Li-8100 device exhibited pronounced seasonal 

variations and reflected the dynamics of WFPS in the upper soil layers, with low values 

over the dry season (from June to September) and high values over the wet season 

(Figure 3 ). Soil CO2 effluxes over the study period ranged from 1.5 to 7.0 µmol m-2 s-

1 in treatment -W and from 1.5 to 7.3 µmol m-2 s-1 in treatment +W. Cumulative surface 

effluxes the last year before the clear-cut were 136.5 ± 21.8 and 130.3 ± 24.8 mol m-2 

year-1 in treatments +W and -W, respectively, and they were 108.0 ± 15.8 and 119.3 ± 

22.5 mol m-2 year-1 the first year after the clear-cut in coppice-managed stands (Figure 

3 ). These cumulative soil CO2 effluxes were not significantly different between 

treatments +W and -W. Soil CO2 effluxes measured with the home-made closed-

chamber system exhibited the same seasonal pattern and similar range of values as 

the soil CO2 effluxes measured using the closed-path Li8100 system. The correlation 

between soil CO2 effluxes measured from October 2016 to October 2017 by the two 

methods was high (r2= 0.80), which suggests accurate estimates of N2O and CH4 

fluxes using the closed-chamber method at our site (Appendix 

Appendix 1).The clear-cut did not significantly (p = 0.379) affect soil CO2 effluxes 

measured using the Li-8100 device (0.58 ± 0.19 and 0.47 ± 0.14 kg CO2 m-2 months-1 

in NH and +W, respectively, from June 2016 to December 2017).

Soil CH4 effluxes ranged from -6.1 to -1.4 nmol m-2 s-1 in treatment +W (-3.7 ± 1.5 nmol 

m-2 s-1 on average) and from -5.6 to -1.2 nmol m-2 s-1 in treatment -W (-3.3 ± 0.8 nmol 

m-2 s-1 on average) throughout the study period (Figure 4 ).  Negative effluxes of CH4 

at soil surface indicated a net consumption of atmospheric CH4 by the soil. Similar 

cumulative soil CH4 effluxes over 1.5 year after the clear-cut between treatments +W 

and -W (F = 4.002, P = 0.465), as well as between treatments +W and NH (F = 3.262, 

P = 0.116), showed that throughfall exclusion and clear-cutting did not significantly 

influence soil CH4 effluxes (data not shown). 

 

Soil N2O effluxes ranged from -0.09 to 1.68 nmol m-2 s-1 in treatment +W (0.48 ± 0.46 

nmol m-2 s-1 on average) and from -0.08 to 1.27 nmol m-2 s-1 in -W (0.43 ± 0.33 nmol 

m-2 s-1 on average)(Figure 4 ). Similar cumulative soil N2O effluxes over 1.5 year after 

the clear-cut between treatments +W and -W (F = 0.675, P = 0.412), as well as 

between treatments NH and +W (F = 2.748, P = 0.616), showed that throughfall 

exclusion and clear-cutting did not significantly influence soil N2O effluxes (data not 

shown).

3.3.3 Gas concentrations throughout deep soil profiles 

Mean CO2 concentrations from March 2016 to December 2017 were 22.1% higher in 

treatment +W than in treatment -W across the sampling depths (Figure 5  A, B). CO2 

concentrations sharply increased with depth in treatments +W and -W. At a depth of 

0.1 m, CO2 concentrations ranged from 2438 to 9560 ppm in treatment -W (4774 ppm 

on average), and from 1700 to 9844 ppm in treatment +W (4178 ppm on average). At 

a depth of 15.5 m, CO2 concentrations ranged from 9174 to 21784 ppm in treatment -

W (13467 ppm on average), and from 13220 to 23938 ppm in treatment +W (18303 

ppm on average).  

 

Mean CH4 concentrations from March 2016 to December 2017 were 37.5% lower in 

treatment +W than in treatment -W across the sampling depths (Figure 5  C, D). CH4 

concentrations increased with depth in treatments +W and -W. At a depth of 0.1 m, 

CH4 concentrations ranged from 0.14 to 0.92 ppm in treatment -W (0.37 ppm on 

average), and from 0.18 to 0.96 ppm in treatment +W (0.44 ppm on average). At a 

depth of 15.5 m, CH4 concentrations ranged from 0.47 to 1.29 ppm in treatment -W 

(0.92 ppm on average), and from 0.27 to 0.89 ppm in treatment +W (0.61 ppm on 

average).  

 

Mean N2O concentrations from March 2016 to December 2017 were 7.6% higher in 

treatment +W than in treatment -W across the sampling depths (Figure 5  E, F). At a 

depth of 0.1 m, N2O concentrations ranged from 352 to 634 ppb in treatment -W (447 

ppb on average), and from 355 to 685 ppb in treatment +W (454 ppb on average). At 

a depth of 15.5 m, N2O concentrations ranged from 347 to 545 ppb in treatment -W 

(454 ppb on average), and from 400 to 573 ppb in treatment +W (496 ppb on average).

3.3.4 CO2, CH4 and N2O productions throughout soil profiles 

CO2, CH4 and N2O productions over the study period were much less influenced by 

throughfall exclusion than the concentrations throughout the soil profiles (Figure 6). 

CO2 and N2O productions were highest and CH4 production lowest in the upper soil 

layer (0-1 m), as a result of a large gradient of concentrations in the topsoil and high 

effective diffusivity. CO2 and N2O productions at depths of more than 4 m were close 

to 0 throughout the study period, and CH4 productions were generally slightly positive 

in very deep soil layers (Figure 6). At a depth of 0.1 m, CO2 production ranged from 

0.4 to 4.6 µmol m-2 s-1 in treatment -W and from 0.9 to 6.7 µmol m-2 s-1 in treatment 

+W, CH4 production ranged from -26.4 to 21.3 nmol m-2 s-1 in treatment -W and from -

41.1 to 5.2 nmol m-2 s-1 in treatment +W, and N2O production ranged from -5.2 to 3.8 

nmol m-2 s-1 in treatment -W and from -4.4 to 6.4 nmol m-2 s-1 in treatment +W. At a 

depth of 11.5 m, CO2 production ranged from -0.06 to 0.08 µmol m-2 s-1 in -W and from 

-0.04 to 0.03 µmol m-2 s-1 in +W, CH4 production ranged from -0.63 to 1.41 nmol m-2 s-

1 in -W and from -0.13 to 0.41 nmol m-2 s-1 in +W and N2O production ranged from -

0.20 to 0.04 nmol m-2 s-1 in -W and from -0.04 to 0.04 nmol m-2 s-1 in +W.  CO2 

production and fine root biomass (diameter &amp;lt;2 mm) were strongly positively correlated 

across the soil layers (r2= 0.76 for +W and r2= 0.56 for -W) (Appendix 2 ). 

Whatever the soil layer, cumulated CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes over the first year after 

the clear-cut in coppice-managed stands were not significatively different in treatments 

+W and -W (Figure 7 ). The cumulative CO2 flux through the 0.1-0.5 m soil layer 

accounted for 76% and 53% of the cumulative CO2 efflux at the soil surface in 

treatments +W and -W, respectively. The cumulative CH4 flux through this soil layer 

accounted for 55% and 53% of the cumulative CH4 efflux at the soil surface in 

treatments +W and -W, respectively. The cumulative N2O flux through this soil layer 

accounted for 80% and 58% of the cumulative N2O efflux at the soil surface in 

treatments +W and -W, respectively. The CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes through the soil 

layers dropped below a depth of 1 m. The small CO2, CH4 and N2O productions in deep 

soil layers corresponded to high soil water contents (Figure 8 ). The temporal variability 

of CO2, CH4 and N2O production was high when the water filled pore space was below 

a threshold of 40%, with either CH4 consumption or production in the upper soil layers 

depending on the sampling period.

3.4 Discussion 

3.4.1 Effect of depth on soil CO2, CH4 and N2O productions 

The main novelty of our results lies in the first in situ measurements of CO2, N2O and 

CH4 concentrations at depths of more than 10 m in tropical planted forests, which made 

it possible to estimate the dynamics of production of major greenhouse gases in 

response to contrasting management and environmental conditions. While CO2 and 

CH4 concentrations increased sharply with depth throughout the soil profile, N2O 

concentrations where much less influenced by the depth. A strong increase in soil CO2 

concentration with depth has been reported in deep tropical soils with an order of 

magnitude consistent with our results. Soil CO2 concentrations reached 80,000 ppm in 

a Brazilian Amazon rainforest (Davidson et al., 2004; Sotta et al., 2007; Trumbore et 

al., 1995), 30,000 ppm in a tropical rainforest in Costa Rica (Schwendenmann &amp;amp; 

Veldkamp, 2006) and 140,000 ppm in an agroforestry system in Indonesia (Van 

Straaten et al., 2010). The highest soil CO2 concentration reached 25,000 ppm in our 

study at a depth of 15.5 m. Physical, chemical, mineralogical and biological properties 

can change considerably throughout deep soil profiles (Davidson et al., 2006; Fierer 

et al., 2003; Oerter et al., 2018; Wiaux et al., 2015). In our study, higher soil water 

contents in deep soil layers than in the topsoil led to a low proportion of air-filled pore 

space in deep soil layers and therefore a slow diffusion rate of the greenhouse gases 

to the atmosphere. Eucalyptus fine roots have been found down to the water table at 

a depth of 17 m in our experiment (Germon et al., 2019), and the deepest roots have 

an important functional role to withdraw water during dry periods (Christina et al., 

2018). The sharp increase in CO2 concentrations with soil depth might therefore reflect 

both CO2 production in deep soil layers through root respiration and microbial 

decomposition of organic matter (dead roots, exudates, dissolved organic matter,…) 

and slow upward diffusion rates of gas in soil layers with a high proportion of water-

filled pore space (Davidson et al., 2004; Schwendenmann &amp;amp; Veldkamp, 2006; Sotta et 

al., 2007). CO2 production estimates from Fick’s law highlighted that CO2 production 

occurs mainly in the upper soil layers but small production rates occur down to a depth 

of 15 m. A low availability of microbial available C, very small nutrient concentrations 

in soil solutions and very low fine root densities in deep soil layers in our experiment 

(Germon et al., 2019; Laclau et al., 2010; Pradier, 2016) contributed to limiting the 



183 
 

 

microbial activity (Fierer et al., 2003). The strong positive correlation between CO2 

production and fine root biomass along the soil profiles suggest that Eucalyptus roots 

are probably the main source of CO2 in deep soil layers, both through root respiration 

and organic inputs decomposed by microbes. The same pattern was shown down to a 

depth of 7 m in a moist tropical forest (Davidson et al., 2004). The seasonality of CO2 

production was stronger in the topsoil than in deep soil layers. CO2 production was 

close to 0 above a threshold of water filled pore space of 45% and small negative 

values of CO2 production were estimated in some deep soil layers. Negative values for 

CO2 production in deep soil layers have been reported in other studies (Davidson et 

al., 2004; De Jong &amp;amp; Schappert, 1972; Risk et al., 2002). We speculate that high 

transpiration rates of E. grandis trees in our experiment (Christina et al., 2018) might 

lead to a withdrawal of dissolved CO2 from deep soil layers to leaves through sap flow 

(Aubrey &amp;amp; Teskey, 2009; Bloemen et al., 2013; Ford et al., 2007; Hanson &amp;amp; Gunderson, 

2009). Further studies are needed to quantify the flux of dissolved CO2 via the xylem 

as Eucalyptus transform almost all incoming energy into latent heat flux through 

transpiration (Vezy et al., 2018).  

CH4 concentrations increase with soil depth in our study but they usually remain below 

the concentration in ambient air. CH4 concentrations higher than in ambient air were 

measured at a few sampling dates in deep soil layers. As in our study, Davidson et al. 

(2004) found some soil areas with high CH4 productions down to a depth of 11 m in a 

moist tropical forest. Spikes of CH4 concentration within the soil profile suggested that 

CH4 production occurred at various depths (down to 8 m) in a forest of the eastern 

Amazonia (Verchot et al., 2000). We show a CH4 consumption in the topsoil and a 

weak CH4 production in deep soil layers whatever the water supply regime in our 

experiment. CH4 production primarily depends on the balance between two 

simultaneously occurring processes, production by methanogens and consumption by 

methanotrophic microorganisms (Dutaur &amp;amp; Verchot, 2007; Tate, 2015). Diffusion of 

gases are inversely proportional to the water-filled pore space. When the water-filled 

pore space decreases, the oxygen diffuses better and small changes in oxygen 

availability impact the balance between the two processes (Sanz-Cobena et al., 2014; 

Wang et al., 2018). Indeed, drier soil condition enhance CH4 consumption whereas 

CH4 production is favored by microsites deprived of O2 in wet soil (Davidson, 1995).  



184 
 

 
 

Surprisingly, soil N2O concentrations were little influenced by the depth in our eucalypt 

stands. By contrast, Verchot et al. (1999) showed a sharp gradient of N2O 

concentrations down to a depth of 8 m in a tropical forest of the eastern Amazonia, 

which suggested a low production in deep soil layers. N2O production in soils is driven 

by microbial nitrification (i.e. oxidation of NH4+ to NO3-) and denitrification (i.e. reduction 

of NO3- to N2O) (Bai et al., 2014; Ortiz-Gonzalo et al., 2018; Zhong et al., 2014). Soil 

microbes consuming N2O have been identified recently (Jones et al., 2013; Jones et 

al., 2014; Orellana et al., 2014; Sanford et al., 2012), and the low changes in N2O 

concentrations with depth in our study might result from a simultaneous production and 

consumption throughout the soil profile. The diffusivity model estimated slightly 

negative N2O productions in some soil areas, which might a result of a reduction from 

dissolved N2O to N2 and/or a withdrawal from deep soil layers to leaves through sap 

flow (Chapuis?Lardy et al., 2007).  

3.4.2 Effect of throughfall exclusion on soil CO2, CH4 and N2O productions 

Contrary to our first hypothesis, throughfall exclusion did not significantly influence 

CO2, N2O and CH4 effluxes at the soil surface as well as the production throughout the 

soil profile estimated with the diffusivity model. In both treatments +W and -W, soil CO2 

effluxes were within the range of measurements in tropical forest ecosystems (Cattânio 

et al., 2002; Davidson et al., 2004; Davidson et al., 2008; Nouvellon et al., 2012; Sotta 

et al., 2007). Higher CO2 effluxes in wet season than in dry season suggest that soil 

moisture could be a strong driver of soil CO2 emissions, as pointed out in other tropical 

and subtropical forests (Courtois et al., 2018; Davidson et al., 2010; Davidson et al., 

2004; Sotta et al., 2007). Davidson et al. (2008) also found strong seasonal variations 

and no significant differences between control and throughfall exclusion treatments on 

CO2 effluxes in an Amazonian forest. Unlike our observations, Sotta et al. (2007) 

showed in an Amazonian forest that CO2 effluxes were lower in a throughfall exclusion 

plot than in the control plot during the dry season, and no differences were found 

between the control plot and the throughfall exclusion plot during the wet season. Fine 

root area index in treatment -W (32.8 m2 m-2) was significantly higher than in treatment 

+W (26.5 m2 m-2) in our 1.5-year-old coppice-managed Eucalyptus plantation (Germon 

et al., 2019), which may have offset the depressive effect of throughfall exclusion on 

microbial activity via a decrease in soil moisture.  



185 
 

 

In both treatments +W and -W, CH4 effluxes at soil surface were strongly negative over 

the entire study period, which shows a net consumption of atmospheric CH4 by the 

soil. CH4 consumption is common in nearly all types of aerated soils: in forests 

(Davidson et al., 2004; Davidson et al., 2008; Nakano et al., 2004), deserts (Hou et al., 

2012; McLain &amp;amp; Martens, 2006; Oerter et al., 2018), grasslands (Fang et al., 2014; 

Mosier et al., 1991) and tundra (Whalen &amp;amp; Reeburgh, 1990). A wide diversity of 

methanotrophs in tropical soils might account for steady CH4 effluxes at the soil 

surface in treatments +W and -W despite strong seasonal changes in soil water 

contents (Knief et al., 2005). N2O effluxes at the soil surface were also similar in 

treatments +W and -W, with low seasonal variations. N2O effluxes were generally lower 

in dry season than in wet season in an Amazonian forest, and throughfall exclusion 

decreased the seasonal variability (Davidson et al., 2004). N2O production is favored 

in wet soils while dry conditions favor the production of NO (Davidson et al., 2000a; 

Firestone &amp;amp; Davidson, 1989). Interruption of tree transpiration after cutting the trees in 

our experiment led to high soil water contents in the topsoil over most of the study 

period, which might explain the low influence of treatments +W and -W on greenhouse 

gas effluxes.  

While CO2, N2O and CH4 effluxes at the soil surface were not influenced by throughfall 

exclusion in our study, the concentrations of CO2 and N2O were 18.1 and 6.9% lower, 

respectively, and  CH4 concentrations were 60% higher in treatment -W than in 

treatment +W. Modeling effective diffusivity showed that the cumulated production 

rates of CO2, N2O and CH4 in each soil layer were similar in the two treatments. The 

effects of throughfall exclusion on gas concentrations throughout the soil profiles were 

mainly a result of the influence of soil water contents on soil gas diffusivity. High soil 

water contents in the +W treatment lead to a saturation of the pore-space with water, 

which results in a slow diffusion of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere also pointed 

out in other studies (Maier et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018). Throughfall exclusion 

experiments in tropical and subtropical forests show site-dependent responses to a 

decrease in throughfall for CO2, N2O and CH4 concentrations in very deep soil profiles 

(4 m deep or more). Throughfall exclusion can either decrease (Cattânio et al., 2002) 

or increase (Davidson et al., 2004), N2O concentrations in deep soil profiles and can 

lead to either similar (Davidson et al., 2004) or lower (Sotta et al., 2007; Van Straaten 

et al., 2011), CO2 concentrations than in control plots. CH4 concentrations in deep soil 



186 
 

 
 

profiles were either similar (Davidson et al., 2004) or higher (Cattânio et al., 2002) in 

response to throughfall exclusion than in control plots.  

3.4.3 Effect of harvesting trees on soil CO2, CH4 and N2O effluxes 

Contrary to our third hypothesis, cutting all the trees did not lead to an increase in CO2, 

CH4 and N2O effluxes, whatever the water supply regime. Harvesting Eucalyptus trees 

in plantations managed in short rotations lead to huge changes in soil environment 

likely to enhance organic matter decomposition, with an increase in soil temperature 

and soil moisture as well as accumulation of harvest residues at soil surface (Christina 

et al., 2017; Mendham et al., 2002; O'connell et al., 2004; Rocha et al., 2016). Another 

study in our experiment showed that harvesting did not lead to an increase in root 

mortality in the stands managed in coppice, whatever the water supply regime 

(Germon et al., 2019). We speculate that the lack of effect of clearcutting on CO2 

effluxes in our experiment may result from a decrease in root respiration after the 

harvest offsetting an increase in decomposition of organic matter at the soil surface.  

Replanting present several drawbacks. Parfitt et al. (2001) showed that harvesting and 

replanting Pinus radiata resulted in a reduction of N status in soil, a loss of organic 

matter and an increase in soil respiration because roots from the previous rotation are 

decomposed and surface-soil microbial activity is enhanced following the clear-cut. 

Furthermore, harvesting and replanting are usually accompanied by considerable soil 

disturbance and also are longer exposed to wind and to erosion (Berhongaray et al., 

2017). Coppice management might be an interesting option in Eucalyptus plantations 

managed in short rotation, to help mitigate the increase in CO2, CH4 and N2O in the 

atmosphere and to limit soil erosion compared to systematic replanting.  

Very deep tropical soils cover large areas worldwide and improving our understanding 

of soil- plant interactions throughout deep soil profiles is needed to improve the 

biogeochemical models used to predict the consequences of climate change on 

greenhouse gas effluxes in tropical planted forests. The dynamics of greenhouse gas 

concentrations in soil profiles result from the activity of microbial communities and can 

help gaining insight into the factors controlling biological activity in deep soil layers.

CHAPTER 4 - MODELING CO2 PRODUCTION AND TRANSPORT IN A DEEP 

FERRALSOL UNDER EUCALYPTS PLANTATIONS SUBJECTED TO 

CONTRASTED RAINFALL REGIMES 

 

This additional work is entitled « Modeling CO2 production and transport in a deep 

Ferralsol under eucalypt plantations subjected to contrasted rainfall regimes ». The 

central objective of this additional work is to present the advances on a modeling 

approach carried out in this thesis in order to gain insight into the processes governing 

CO2 transfer at a local scale. We aimed to couple a Numerical Model for the Analysis 

of the Geochemical Evolution of Mineral-Water-Air Systems (Min3P) with a simple root 

architecture model, Root-Typ. 

To consider the distribution of eucalypt fine roots within the entire root profile, including 

the deep soil horizons, we first tried to calibrate the Root-Typ model (Part 1) with 

eucalypt root data measured at Itatinga, then we tried to include fine root dynamics in 

Min3P (Part 2). 

This additional will not be published in a scientific journal because the development 

initiated in this thesis could not lead to exploitable results. 

However, the following co-authors are associated with and involved in the work: Loic 

Pagès, Christophe Jourdan, Jean-Paul Laclau and Céline Blitz-Frayret for the 

calibration and parametrization of the Root-Typ Model, and Frédéric Gerard, Guerric 

Le Maire, Jean-Paul Laclau and particularly Céline Blitz-Frayret for the calibration and 

parametrization of the Min3P model.

4.1  Introduction 

After a strong expansion in the last 20 years, forest plantations account for 7% of the 

total forest area in the world (Keenan et al., 2015). In tropical and subtropical regions, 

plantations of fast-growing tree species store large amounts of carbon and contribute 

to reducing the exploitation of natural forests by providing an increasing proportion of 

the global demand of wood (Keenan et al., 2015). Fast-growing Eucalyptus plantations 

cover about 20 million hectares throughout the world (Booth, 2013) with about 5.6 

million hectares in Brazil (IBA, 2016). In Brazil, most of Eucalyptus plantations are 

settled in areas with very deep soils (&gt; 5m) with low fertility and prolonged drought 

periods (Gonçalves et al., 2013). 

Future climate projections predict longer and stronger dry periods for eastern-south 

America (Solomon et al., 2009). In this context, coppice management of eucalypt 

plantations could be an interesting option to face water deficit because, after the 

harvest, the trees are likely to benefit from an already installed root system making it 

possible to access to deep soil layers where water availability is higher than in the 

topsoil. Our aim was to gain insight into the consequences of drought on fine root 

production and mortality as well as on the production of greenhouse gases down to 

the water table (at a depth of 17 m). These effects have been monitored before and 

after harvesting in a coppice-managed Eucalyptus grandis stand under two contrasting 

water supply regimes: the undisturbed rainfall as a control and 37% throughfall 

reduction to assess the effects of water deficit on tree and soil functioning.  

The consequences of tree harvesting on root dynamics the first year of the rotation in 

coppice-managed plantations ask specific questions never studied, particularly in deep 

soil layers. After the harvest, fine root mortality leads to an input of organic matter at 

different depths (Berhongaray et al., 2015). Decomposition of fresh organic matter may 

enhance the degradation of pre-existing organic matter, stabilized or not (Fontaine et 

al., 2007; Derrien et al., 2014) through a "priming effect" (Kuzyakov et al., 2000). The 

"priming effect" could affect carbon storage by the ecosystem and indirectly influence 

the nitrogen cycle. Most of the studies dealing with soil carbon storage are limited to 

the upper meter of the soil profile (Harper and Tibbett, 2013). The dynamics of CO2 

concentrations across soil profiles down to a depth of more than 10 m have never been 

studied in tropical forest plantations. 



201 
 

 

We have studied fine root dynamics (production and mortality) using the minirhizotrons 

technique and measured the concentrations of CO2 down to the water table in the 

chapters 2 and 3. Root dynamics and gas concentrations were monitored before and 

after the harvest of Eucalyptus grandis trees in a throughfall exclusion experiment, 

comparing plots with 37% of throughfall excluded by plastic sheets (-W), and plots 

without rain exclusion (+W). The main results obtained over 3 months before clear-

cutting, then over 18 months in coppice, showed that CO2 concentrations increased on 

average from 4475 ± 2180 ppm at a soil depth of 10 cm to 15885 ± 3538 ppm at a 

depth of 15.5 m across the two water supply regimes. CO2 concentrations measured 

in treatment -W were on average 20.7% lower than in treatment +W, across the 

sampling depths.  

We intended to go beyond the current measurements of gas concentrations at different 

depths in the soil profile through a mechanistic modeling approach making it possible 

to assess the production of gas throughout the soil profiles and to infer the sensibility 

of gas production to environmental factors. To better understand the dynamics of 

organic matter in deep tropical soils and to improve the modeling of element flows, it 

is necessary to quantify in situ the carbon (CO2 as well as dissolved inorganic and 

organic C) concentrations throughout entire soil profiles (down to the root front), and 

to characterize the carbon stabilization/destabilization processes, as well as the main 

regulatory factors. A modeling approach was required to (i) quantify the production of 

CO2 in different soil horizons from soil properties, root growth and gas concentration 

measurements throughout the profile, and (ii) to improve our understanding of transfer 

processes and the contribution of CO2 deep production mechanisms to soil surface 

emissions (Maier and Schack-Kirchner, 2014).   

Reactive transport models derived from Darcy’s law allows a dynamic description of 

transient water flow in soils but also chemical processes controlling soil solution 

chemical composition (Feyen et al., 1998; Simunek et al., 2006; Samouëlian et al., 

2007; Steefel et al., 2015). Reactive transport models require a vast number of input 

parameters and careful calibration procedures. Steefel et al. (2015) compared the key 

flow and transport features of the most commonly used reactive transport models: 

PHT3D, OpenGeoSys (OGS), ORCHESTRA, TOUGHREACT, eSTOMP, 

HYDROGEOCHEM, Crunch-Flow and MIN3P (Table 1).

After a careful evaluation of the reactive transport models in the literature and their 

advantages and constraints to be adapted to the specificity of our study site (in 

particular very deep soil and monitoring over a long period), we selected the Min3P 

model already in use at the UMR Eco&amp;amp;Sols. This model was used in order to try to 

carry out simulations of the biogeochemical processes coupled with the transport of 

water, solutes and gases in soil (Mayer et al., 2012). Indeed, gas transport is highly 

dependent on soil moisture and modeling soil water fluxes is therefore compulsory. 

The fate of organic matter in very deep soil horizons remains poorly documented, 

which is a serious concern of the current modeling approaches of soil carbon dynamics 

(Fontaine et al., 2007; Rumpel and Kögel-Knabner, 2011; Mathieu et al., 2015). 

A modeling approach was needed to answer to the following questions: 

- What are the main transport and reaction processes accounting for the 

observed CO2 concentrations in a deep tropical soil explored by roots in 

eucalypt plantations? 

- What is the contribution of fine roots in CO2 effluxes at the soil surface? 

- What are the consequences of drought periods on CO2 production and efflux in 

eucalypt plantations established in deep Ferralsols? 

- What are the consequences of future climatic scenarios on CO2 production in 

deep soil layers and the effluxes at the soil surface? 

Process-based models are needed to gain insight into the biogeochemical processes 

driving the concentrations of greenhouse gases measured at a few dates in soil 

profiles. 

Modeling root architecture development is important to simulate temporal and spatial 

dynamics of the root system architecture. Root architectural models are also useful to 

estimate global root variables like biomass or surface over depth and time. They are 

parameterized by root type (e.g. RootTyp, Pagès et al. (2004); ArchiSimple, Pagès et 

al. (2014); DigR, Barczi et al. (2018)) or by branching order (e.g. OpenSimRoot; 

Postma et al. (2017);  parametric L-system modeling; Leitner et al. (2010)). The 

number of parameters needed to simulate root architecture vary among models and 

infer their level of complexity (Dunbabin et al., 2013). Root number, root diameter, root 

volume, and root radial distances are the main parameters of root system 

biomechanics (Nicoll and Ray, 1996; Danquechin Dorval et al., 2016). RootTyp model 



204 
 

 
 

showed promising efficiency in modeling root system development of Quercu petraea 

(Collet et al., 2006) but also several species with various structures (Bingham and Wu, 

2011; Chen et al., 2011; Couvreur et al., 2012). RootTyp model is easy to calibrate 

while combining many processes of root system development: (1) emission of new 

roots from the shoot system, (2) elongation, (3) branching, (4) radial growth and (5) 

decay and self-pruning of existing roots. This architectural model can also be coupled 

with models simulating nutrient uptake (Mayer, 1999; Bonneu et al., 2012; Mayer et 

al., 2012), water transport (Doussan et al., 1998) or rhizospheric processes (Kim and 

Silk, 1999) or even reactive transport model (Mayer, 1999; Mayer et al., 2012). 

We aimed to couple a Numerical Model for the Analysis of the Geochemical Evolution 

of Mineral-Water-Air Systems (Min3P) with a simple root architecture model, Root-Typ 

(Pagès et al., 2004), to gain insight into the processes governing CO2 transfer at a 

local scale. To consider the distribution of eucalypt fine roots within the entire root 

profile, including the deep soil horizons, we first tried to calibrate the Root-Typ model 

(Part 1) with eucalypt root data measured at Itatinga, then we tried to include fine root 

dynamics in Min3P (Part 2). 

4.2 Part 1: The Root Typ model 

4.2.1 Calibration and parameterization of the Root Typ model 

Description and parameterization of the Root Typ model 

The Root Typ model (Pagès et al., 2004) simulates root growth processes at a daily 

time step: emission of new roots, elongation, branching and radial growth of various 

plant species by computing at each time step the root segments and the corresponding 

root length densities on a Cartesian grid. The model implements several 

developmental processes including root emission, axial and radial growth, sequential 

branching, reiteration, transition, decay and abscission. To simulate tree root systems, 

additional parameters are needed to simulate reiteration, senescence and late 

emission processes. All the parameters of Root Typ model are indexed to the apical 

diameter of all roots without distinction of root typology, which is impossible to assume 

in order to simulate growth and distribution of all types of roots of Eucalyptus trees 

within the soil profile. The issue was thus to adapt the Root Typ model to Eucalyptus 

trees. 



205 
 

 

Definition of root types 

The Root Typ parametrization started with the definition of root types. In order to 

represent the most accurately Eucalyptus root systems we defined 6 root types. They 

are described and listed below (Figure 1 ). 

 

 

Figure 1 - Schematic representation of Eucalyptus root system in vertical view, with 
the different root types and their characteristics. 

 

The root segments are not indexed to the position, so we had to create each time 

intermediate types for the macrostructure to distinguish between proximal and distal 

systems. 

 

• Type 1: Juvenile tap root, orthotropic root from the radicle.  

• Type 2: Mature tap root, orthotropic root that follow the juvenile tap root by 

transformation, can be carried by plagiotropic roots.  

• Type 3:  Juvenile plagiotropic macrorhize, plagiotropic root from the juvenile tap 

root. 

• Type 4:  Mature plagiotropic macrorhize, plagiotropic root that follow the juvenile 

plagiotropic roots by transformation. 

• Type 5: Intermediate roots between macrorhizes and brachyrhizes 



206 
 

 
 

• Type 6: brachyrhizes. Extremely fine roots.  

 

Parameters needed for modeling 

For each root type, several root parameters are needed for this dynamic developmental 

model. There are listed below: 

• Average and standard deviation of the insertion angle 

• Duration before emergence  

• Growth parameters: maximum, average and standard deviation of growth rate  

• Inter-branch distance along the root  

• Indicator of tropism type and tropism intensity 

• Sensibility to mechanical constraint 

• Apical diameter  

• Necrosis duration  

• Dates of reiterations and probability for reiteration at the reiteration dates 

• Minimal and maximal number of reiterated roots 

• Age from which transition may happen and daily probability of transition 

• Proportions of type among the branches  

 

A literature review made it possible to estimate all the parameters needed for the 

simulations. We mainly used data obtained in Eucalyptus plantations in Brazil and 

Congo. Most of the data dealing with root architecture came from the PhD thesis “Study 

of the root system of Eucalyptus in tropical plantation: architectural analysis, growth 

and respiration” of Armel Thongo M’Bou in Congo (Thongo M’Bou, 2008). 

The next step was to include for each root type a coefficient for diameter increases 

throughout tree growth. Then we included into the code the possibility of choosing the 

seed to start the simulation. Those changes were important to represent accurately 

Eucalyptus root systems and to validate the output simulations made.     

 

  



207 
 

 

Setting up a R routine for calculation of root length per volume of soil 

In order to represent an accurate root system, we had to estimate the root length 

simulated per volume of soil. A R routine was coded using the output of the Root Typ 

model to compare the results simulated with the data obtained in the field.  

 

Modification of root density and ramification varying within the soil profile 

We modified the soil profile component of the Root Typ model to include changes in 

root density and ramification within the soil profile. We also increased the soil profile 

depth down to 17 m.  

 

4.2.2  Main results obtained by simulations using the Root Typ model 

We succeeded in simulating realistic root systems throughout the development of 

Eucalyptus trees (Figure 2 , Figure 3 , Figure 5 ).

4.2.3 Discussion and perspectives 

Despite several attempts of simulations and 6 different modified versions of the Root 

Typ model, we did not succeed in designing simulated fine root densities close to the 

values measured in the field, especially between layers within the soil profile.  

Particularly, we did not manage to simulate the measured dynamics (too sharp 

mortality, high variability between the simulations). Therefore, we decided to force 

measured values as input values for root length density into the Min3P model in order 

to achieve the objectives of the project. 

However, the improvement we made for the Root Typ model were important and more 

time is needed to parametrize and calibrate this model to tree root system development 

throughout an entire rotation. This work showed that the Root Typ model can be used 

to simulate tree root development over short period (up to 1-2 years) but more research 

is needed to simulate an entire rotation, as planned in our study. The two main issues 

rose in our project are listed and discussed here after. 

  



211 
 

 

Too much variability between seeds (simulations) 

This is indeed a problem with stochastic models, when an event arriving early is very 

structuring for the future. In reality, compensating regulations operate, which are 

difficult to account for in this type of model. We should avoid in the setting up of the 

model, the very unlikely events that have a strong impact. For example, there must be 

a sufficient number of plagiotropic roots, varying their asymptotic lengths.  

Exclusive pruning 

All root branches have shorter root longevity than the bearing roots, therefore when 

branches are pruned the bearing axes become bare, which is never the case in the 

field. Therefore, a gap in the root length density was observed according to soil depth 

in the output simulations that we did not observe in field measurements within the entire 

soil profile.  

Indeed, the fact of having a fixed lifespan for all roots belonging to the same diameter 

class generates unrealistic simulations. Several options could be tested in further 

studies, not necessarily exclusive: 

• To create a root type that does not grow too fast with a wide range of length. 

Some will be pruned quickly and other should stay longer throughout the soil 

profile simulated 

• To include into the code the possibility to have little branches (small branching 

densities) in such way that the longer roots carry some branches and therefore 

do not prune.   

• To create a new root type of extremely fine roots that grow for longer period and 

branch or live longer than extremely fine roots that are pruned quickly. 

• Include into the code a proximal reiteration regularly, to keep alive roots 

everywhere. 

• Include into the code for a root lifespan different within the soil profile and for 

each root type. 

Modeling architecture development and dynamics of deep fine roots are hindered by 

the limited data available in the literature yet indispensable to parametrize and evaluate 



212 
 

 
 

the models. Root number, root diameter, root volume, and root radial distances are the 

main parameters of root system biomechanics (Nicoll and Ray, 1996; Danquechin 

Dorval et al., 2016), varying considerably with soil layers. The plasticity of root system 

architecture development responding to their environment is strongly influenced by soil 

depth. Root architectural models through a simulation in 3D space of the root system 

could simulate accurately spatial and temporal dynamics. But integrate into a model a 

vertically discretized soils is particularly important as shallow and deep roots present 

different spatial and temporal dynamics. Model parametrization needs to consider 

shallow and deeper-rooted root system behaving differently to environmental factors 

and soil conditions. 

4.3 Part 2 : Min3P model 

4.3.1 Calibration and parameterization of the Min3P model 

Description of Min3P model 

Min3P (Mayer et al., 2012) is a finite-volume reactive transport model including flow in 

the aqueous phase using Richard’s equations and transport in the aqueous and gas 

phase. The flow and transport are computed on a representative domain of the field, 

composed of a Cartesian grid with elementary volumes called ‘control volumes’. 

Primary variables of the model are aqueous concentrations, which are considered in 

equilibrium with gas-phase concentrations according to Henry’s law.  The use of the 

Dusty Gas Model for gas-phase transport allows the implementation of the transport 

mechanisms often neglected in previous studies (Molins et al., 2008). The model 

formulation includes diffusion and advection to account for gas transport. Diffusion of 

gases is described by Stefan-Maxwell equations. To model diffusive fluxes with gases 

characterized by different molecular weights, a non-separative component may be 

present. Gas fluxes included in the experiment can be large enough to generate 

significant pressure gradients, leading to advective fluxes computed by Darcy’s law. 

Field observations and laboratory studies have revealed that additional processes can 

control biogeochemical evolution in the vadose zone, possibly attenuating gas 

emissions in the atmosphere. For this reason, reactions taking place in the aqueous 

phase such as oxidation of methane by bacteria producing carbon dioxide, water and 



213 
 

 

organic carbon, are also implemented. Finally, diffusive and advective gas fluxes and 

reaction source-sink term contribute to the mass balance. 

Min3P is particularly suitable for the current study thanks to its implementation of the 

uptake of water and solute by plants (Gérard et al., 2004; Gérard et al., 2008). Indeed, 

gas transfer in the soil is highly dependent on soil water content and modeling soil 

water fluxes is therefore compulsory (Figure 6 ). Separate sink terms have been 

implemented in the Richard’s equation to account for physical evaporation and 

transpiration (components of the root water uptake) in Min3P. For each control volume 

of the grid, the physical evaporation is depending on the local water saturation and is 

considered as a one-dimensional process in vertical direction along a soil column. To 

model the biological plant transpiration process, the evaporative budget has to be 

estimated and is determined with the soil moisture, allowing the consideration of the 

negative effects of water stress on plant transpiration. Finally, the solute uptake has 

been implemented by an additional sink term in the mass balance equation. Then, two 

uptake regimes are considered: 1) passive solute uptake where the solute uptake rate 

is equal to the water uptake rate and 2) rejective or active solute uptake. Rejective 

uptake implies the solute to be left behind water during uptake by the root (leading to 

an increase of solute quantity in the root zone) and active uptake implies a preferential 

solute uptake by the plant root (leading to a solute depletion in the root zone).  

The first key step was to calibrate and parameterize the water transport. The 

simulations of water dynamics were validated using measurements of: (i) actual 

transpiration fluxes and (ii) volumetric soil water content monitored over the whole 

study period. The climatic variables (potential and actual transpiration fluxes, 

precipitation) determined at the experimental site were used either to constrain the 

model or to validate it.

Soil parameterization and root profiles 

Three layers of 33.3 cm thickness were defined to account for the variability of soil and 

root characteristics in the upper meter. Layers of 50 cm were defined from a depth of 

1m to a depth of 18 m. Soil retention curves and hydraulic conductivity were estimated 

at the same site using Van Genuchten equations. In each soil layer, the soil water 

potential was linked to the soil water content by the relation of Van Genuchten (1980).

Residual soil water content in each soil layer was calibrated using MAESPA model 

(Christina et al., 2017) used at the same site. The MAESPA model, fully described in 

Duursma and Medlyn (2012), is a soil-plant-atmosphere model simulating forest 

canopy radiation absorption, photosynthesis and water balance. Soil hydraulic 

conductivity at saturation was measured at the same site down to a depth of 3 m 

(Maquere, 2008) and assumed to decrease linearly from 3 to 7 m depth and to be 

constant for the soil layers below 7 m down to 18m. Soil porosity was also measured 

down to 3 m and assumed constant below 3m. Evapotranspiration and soil evaporation 

were obtained by simulations using MAESPA model each day over the entire rotation 

(6 years).   

A literature review and simulations of the MAESPA model were realized to obtain the 

initial condition variability-saturated flow. The initial condition of hydraulic charge, 

pressure head, saturation, soil water content and root evaporation are necessary for 

flow simulations. Other inputs needed for the simulation are the daily climatic data.

We were not able to use the outputs of the Root Typ model, so we estimated a relation 

between root length density, depth and time using root distributions along the soil 

profile measured at 1, 2, 3 and 7 years after planting. Root distributions were measured 

by soil coring (see Germon et al. (2018) and Christina et al. (2011) and Chapter 2 for 

the method).

4.3.2  Discussion and perspectives from simulations using Min3P model  

The simulations results in Figure 7  show that the soil water contents can be modeled 

over an entire rotation, but improvements are still needed. Unfortunately, we did not 

have enough time to conclude the parameterization and calibration of the Min3P model.

Model parameterization should be better described, particularly regarding the accuracy 

at which the root system and potential transpiration are simulated over time. Further 

studies dealing with long-term effects of rainfall regimes on soil water resources, could 

contribute to evaluating adaptive changes induced by drought periods in tropical 

Eucalyptus plantations. 

plantations. 

CO2 production during fine root decomposition and root respiration 

Simulations should include CO2 gas emissions produced at each time step by fine roots 

(mortality and decomposition, root respiration, …). From these results, a comparison 

with the measurements of CO2 performed throughout the soil profile need to be 

performed to assess the main gas transport processes and sources.  

CO2 production has been found to be correlated to root biomass throughout the soil 

profile (Chapter 3). Mechanistic biogeochemical models need to include the 

relationships between soil CO2 production and soil water potential, soil temperature 

over time, but also fine root growth and root activity across soil layers. Indeed, 

incorporating the different level of processes of root respiration and microbial 

decomposition over depths should provide more accurate estimations and could 

reduce uncertainty in model simulations.   

Prediction of CO2 production in deep soil profiles under climate change 

Simulations to explore the effects of future climate scenarios on CO2 production and 

transfer in deep tropical soils could be performed including the current measurements 

as initial boundary conditions, and by comparing climatic series representing future 

climatic scenarios at the experimental field location. The predictions could be useful to 

assess qualitatively the consequences of climate change on CO2 production in tropical 

eucalypt plantations growing on deep Ferralsols. 

Conclusion 

The modeling approach used in this thesis revealed promising efficiency in a model 

that couple root system architecture and functions, the Root Typ model, with reactive 

transport processes in soils, the Min3P model. Unfortunately, this thesis also revealed 

several issues that we could not overcome over the available time of 6 months at the 



219 
 

 

end of the thesis. This chapter showed that additional experimental researches and 

model developments are required to assess the production of gas throughout the soil 

profiles and to infer the sensibility of gas production to environmental factors in this 

Eucalyptus plantation. Therefore, a specific thesis in modeling is required to reinforce 

and further explore the possibilities of coupling Min3P and RootTyp to gain insight into 

the processes governing greenhouse gases transfer at a local scale.

CHAPTER 5 - CONSEQUENCES OF MIXING ACACIA MANGIUM AND 

EUCALYPTUS GRANDIS TREES ON SOIL EXPLORATION BY FINE-ROOTS 

DOWN TO A DEPTH OF 17 M 

 

In addition to the studies presented in this thesis, during my thesis, I had the 

opportunity to study the consequences of mixing Acacia mangium and Eucalyptus 

grandis trees on soil exploration by roots down to the water table at 17 m depth in a 

tropical planted forest. 

Eucalyptus plantation mixed with nitrogen fixing trees can be considered as a form of 

ecological intensification through the increase of forest plantations production and 

nutrient availability in the soil (Bouillet et al. 2012, Forrester et al., 2005; Kelty, 2006). 

Multi-purpose plantations can provide key ecosystem services (Paquette &amp;amp; Messier, 

2010), in some situations, increase the total biomass production (Forrester, 2014; 

Richards et al., 2010) and positive relationships between tree diversity and soil fauna, 

microbial diversity, and soil carbon (C) sequestration are well documented (Blaser et 

al., 2014; Forrester, 2014; Richards et al., 2010). But the consequences of mixing trees 

on root growth and fine-root morphology in very deep soil layers is poorly know.  

In this study, root sampling was realized down to 17 m in A. mangium and E. grandis 

monospecific stands and a mixture with 50% of each species using the method 

described in chapter 2. In this study, I did not contribute to the acquisition of the data, 

but I contributed to the data analysis as well as the statistical analyses and the writing 

of the paper.

Abstract: 

Background and Aims Fine-root functioning is a major driver of plant growth and 

strongly influences the global carbon cycle. While fine-root over-yielding has been 

shown in the upper soil layers of mixed-species forests relative to monospecific stands, 

the consequences of tree diversity on fine-root growth in very deep soil layers is still 

unknown. Our study aimed to assess the consequences of mixing Acacia mangium 

and Eucalyptus grandis trees on soil exploration by roots down to the water table at 17 

m depth in a tropical planted forest.  

Method Fine roots (diameter &amp;lt;2 mm) were sampled in a randomized block design with 

three treatments: monospecific stands of Acacia mangium (100A), Eucalyptus grandis 

(100E), and mixed stands with 50% of each species (50A50E). Root ingrowth bags 

were installed at 4 depths (from 0.1 m to 6 m) in the three treatments within three 

different blocks, to study the fine-root production over 2 periods of 3 months.  

Results Down to 17 m depth, total fine-root biomass was 1127 g m-2 in 50A50E, 780 g 

m-2 in 100A and 714 g m-2 in 100E. Specific root length and specific root area were 

110-150% higher in 50A50E than in 100A for Acacia mangium trees and 34% higher 

in 50A50E than in 100E for Eucalyptus grandis trees. Ingrowth bags showed that the 

capacity of fine roots to explore soil patches did not decrease down to a depth of 6 m 

for the two species.  

Conclusions Belowground interactions between Acacia mangium and Eucalyptus 

grandis trees greatly increased the exploration of very deep soil layers by fine roots, 

which is likely to enhance the uptake of soil resources. Mixing tree species might 

therefore increase the resilience of tropical planted forests through a better exploration 

of deep soils.

5.1 Introduction 

Plantations of fast-growing trees are expanding rapidly to meet the increasing demand 

for wood products (Keenan et al., 2015). The area covered by planted forests 

increased from about 168 million ha in 1990 to 278 million ha in 2015, and a large 

share of the new forest plantations are at sites with in highly weathered tropical soils 

(Keenan et al., 2015). Fast-growing Eucalyptus plantations cover about 20 million 

hectares throughout the world (Booth, 2013) with about 5.6 million hectares in Brazil 

(IBA 2016). Eucalyptus plantations provide raw material for pulp and paper, charcoal 

and firewood in Brazil (Battie-Laclau et al., 2014; Gonçalves et al., 2013). While most 

of these eucalypt plantations are monospecific, mixed-species stands including 

nitrogen (N) fixing trees can help to balance the N budget, improve the N status of the 

eucalypts (Forrester et al., 2006; Paula et al., 2015) and, in some situations, increase 

the total biomass production (Forrester, 2014; Richards et al., 2010). Multi-purpose 

plantations can provide key ecosystem services (Paquette &amp;amp; Messier, 2010), and 

positive relationships between tree diversity and soil fauna, microbial diversity, and soil 

carbon (C) sequestration are well documented (Blaser et al., 2014; Forrester, 2014; 

Richards et al., 2010). Acacia mangium Wild is another fast-growing tree species 

widely planted in South-East Asia for pulpwood. Introduction of Acacia mangium trees 

into commercial eucalypt plantations has been tested recently in Brazil and Congo 

(Bouillet et al., 2013; Santos et al., 2016; Voigtlaender et al., 2012). Those studies 

showed that mixed A. mangium and Eucalyptus stands had higher available mineral N 

in the soil than monospecific eucalypt stands (Tchichelle et al., 2017; Voigtlaender et 

al., 2012) and that, in some situations, the total biomass production was higher in 

mixed stands than monospecific eucalypt stands at the same stocking density (Bouillet 

et al., 2013; Epron et al., 2013; Santos et al., 2016). While the benefits consequences 

of a stratified canopy in mixed-species plantations are well documented (Bauhus et al., 

2004; Binkley et al., 2013; Le Maire et al., 2013; Williams et al., 2017), soil partitioning 

between the roots of different tree species in a mixed stand has not been studied to 

the same extent. 

Roots play a key role in forest ecosystems with their mechanical functions of tree 

anchorage and their physiological function of capturing and transporting the amounts 

of water and nutrients needed for plant growth (McCormack &amp;amp; Guo, 2014; Pregitzer et 

al., 2002). Niche complementary among the fine roots of different species is often cited 



227 
 

 

as one of the major processes that can contribute to increasing biomass production in 

multi-species stands compared to single-species forests (Lehmann  &amp;amp; Schroth, 2003). 

Studies dealing with fine-root density in mixed-species forests are scarce and mainly 

limited to the upper soil layers. Deep roots, commonly defined as roots growing below 

1 m, can provide access to water and nutrient pools that shallow roots cannot reach 

(Kell, 2012). Even though the density of roots is generally low below 1 m depth 

compared to the topsoil, they are important in reducing nutrient losses by deep 

drainage (Laclau et al., 2010) and improving trees’ drought tolerance to drought 

(Christina et al., 2017a; McDowell et al., 2008). While the effects of environmental 

changes on the phenology of aboveground plant components are well documented, 

belowground processes remain poorly understood (Radville et al., 2016b). The lack of 

information on the influence of interspecific interactions on root exploration at great 

depth limits our ability to identify the most appropriate sites for multi-species 

plantations in tropical regions. Fine-root biomass in the 0-2 m soil layers was found to 

be 30% higher in a mixed-species plantation of E. grandis and A. mangium trees than 

in monospecific stands at age 5 years in Brazil (Laclau et al., 2013c). Interaction 

between the two-species led to a segregation of the root systems. In mixed stands, A. 

mangium fine roots were partially excluded from the topsoil in mixture and over-

explored the soil layers between the depths of 1 and 2 m relative to monospecific A. 

mangium stands (da Silva et al., 2009; Laclau et al., 2013c). However, as far as we 

are aware, the effects of the inter-specific interaction on fine-root densities at depths &gt; 

2 m have never been studied. Changes in fine-root traits might be a major adaptation 

of A. mangium and E. grandis trees to cope with inter-specific interactions in mixed 

stands. Strong modifications of fine-root morphology have been shown in response to 

competition through an increase in specific root length (SRL, fine-root length divided 

by fine-root dry mass) and specific root area (SRA, fine-root area divided by fine-root 

dry mass) to reduce the cost/benefit ratio of resource capture.  

Root growth is controlled by endogenous constraints on carbon availability and 

environmental factors (Freschet et al., 2017; McCormack et al., 2015). Fine-root 

production is dependent on soil water content (Canham et al., 2015) and the high 

plasticity of fine roots enables them to explore resource-rich soil patches has been 

demonstrated (Hodge, 2004). The capacity of A. mangium and E. grandis roots to 

explore soil patches might therefore vary depending on the season and the depth in 



228 
 

 
 

the soil. Although ingrowth bags have been commonly used to estimate fine-root 

production in forest ecosystems (Brunner et al., 2013), the root-free soil in the ingrowth 

bags can be richer in nutrients and water than the surrounding soil (without water and 

nutrient uptake in the first weeks after installation), which can lead to overestimates of 

the fine-root production and length in these soil patches relative to the surrounding soil 

(Bauhus &amp;amp; Messier, 1999; Jourdan et al., 2008).  

Our study aimed to assess the consequences of mixing Acacia mangium and 

Eucalyptus grandis trees on fine-root growth down very deep profiles in highly 

weathered tropical soils. We hypothesized that the interaction between Acacia 

mangium and Eucalyptus grandis trees in mixed stands modified root growth relative 

to monospecific stands, resulting in i) fine-root over-yielding in all the soil layers down 

to the water table at a depth of 17 m, ii) modification of common fine-root traits 

(diameter, SRL, SRA) for the two species making it possible to increase the area of 

soil resource capture per gram of C invested in fine roots, and iii) a higher capacity of 

the tree roots to explore soil patches in the topsoil than in very deep soil layers 

reflecting the decrease in fine-root density with depth. 

5.2 Materials and methods 

5.2.1 Study site 

The study was carried out at the Itatinga experimental station of University of São 

Paulo, Brazil (23°02’ S., 48°38’ W., 860 m a.s.l.). This region has a humid subtropical 

climate (Cfa according to the Köppen classification) with an average annual rainfall of 

1390 mm (mean from 1990 to 2010), a mean relative humidity of 77% and a mean 

annual temperature of 19°C with a cold and dry season from June to September. The 

soils are Ferralsols (FAO classification) developed on Cretaceous sandstone with a 

water table at a depth of 17 m (Pradier et al., 2017). Sand content was around 85% in 

the topsoil and 75-80% between 1 m and 15 m depth (Maquere, 2008). Soil pHH2O was 

approximately 5.5 in the upper 3 m, cation exchange capacity decreased from 18 

mmolc kg-1 in the 0-5 cm soil layer to 2 mmolc kg-1 in the 2-3 m layer, and exchangeable 

cation contents dropped below a depth of 5 cm. Full details were given in a previous 

study (Laclau et al., 2013c).

5.2.2 Experimental Layout 

The trial was a complete randomized block design with 7 treatments and 4 blocks set 

up in May 2003 in a site which had been a Eucalyptus grandis plantation from 1998 to 

2002 and previously a Eucalyptus saligna Sm. coppice from 1940 to 1998.  The 

experimental layout was described in detail by Laclau et al. (2008) and Le Maire et al. 

(2013). There were plots with A. mangium monoculture, E. grandis monoculture and 

mixed plantations of A. mangium and E. grandis within each block. Each plot was 30 

m x 30 m with two buffer rows. The seedlings were planted at a density of 1111 trees 

ha-1 (3 m x 3 m spacing). The trees were harvested at age 6 years (in May 2009) and 

only the harvested boles were removed from the plots. Harvest residues were spread 

uniformly over each plot and A. mangium and E. grandis seedlings were re-planted in 

November 2009 in the same planting rows of the same plots, at 50 cm from the stumps 

of the previous rotation.  

Our study was carried out 4 years after replanting in 3 treatments within 3 blocks: A. 

mangium and E. grandis monospecific stands (100A and 100E, respectively) and 

mixed stands with 50% of each species (50A50E). In the mixed stand, the two species 

were planted alternately in the row and offset adjacent rows (555 trees ha-1 per 

species). The Acacia mangium seedlings were inoculated with rhizobia strains 

selected by EMBRAPA (Agrobiology, Rio de Janeiro) for their N2 fixation capacities. 

The same amounts of P, K, Ca, Mg, and micronutrients were applied the first 18 

months after planting in all the plots (no N fertilization). Destructive sampling at age 

3.3 years showed that mixing the two species did not lead to higher aboveground 

biomass in 50A50E than the average of the two monocultures. Tree height was about 

8 m higher for E. grandis than for A. mangium (Table 1 ).

5.2.3 Root sampling  

Fine roots (diameter &amp;lt;2 mm) were sampled down to a depth of 17 m in the three 

treatments (100A, 100E and 50A50E; Figure 1 ) within the three blocks. Three 

replicates of soil samples were collected at mid distance between 4 adjacent trees 

(Figure 1 ) in each plot down to a depth of 6 m and one replicate per plot between the 

depths of 6 m and 17 m (total of 9 samples per treatment in each soil layer down to 6 

m depth and 3 samples between the depths of 6 m and 17 m). At each sampling 

position, soil layers 0-0.5, 0.5-1.0, 1.0-1.5, 1.5-2.0, 2.0-3.0, 3.0-4.0, 4.0-5.0, 5.0-6.0 m 

were collected by digging a square hole of approximately 15 cm x 15 cm area at the 

soil surface (an operator used a tool designed to dig very deep holes, called ‘cavadeira’ 

in Brazil). Only the soil mass sampled was measured accurately, the volume of the soil 

samples extracted using the ‘cavadeira’ tool could not be measured and was estimated 

by multiplying the soil dry mass of the samples by the bulk density in each layer (see 

below). About 15 kg and 30 kg of soil were collected at each sampling position for 

layers 50 cm and 100 cm thick, respectively. Fresh soil mass was measured in the field 

(±10 g) and all the fine roots easily visible were collected. The soil was then 

homogenized and a sub-sample of approximately 0.5 kg in the 0-50 cm soil layer, 1 kg 

in soil layers 0.5-1.0, 1.0-1.5, 1.5-2.0, 2.0-3.0, 3.0-4.0 m, and 2 kg in soil layers 4.0-5.0 

and 5.0-6.0 m was taken to separate short lengths of root and small diameter fine roots 

in the laboratory. Each sub-sample was weighed in the laboratory and the soil water 

content was measured (by drying 5 g of soil at 105°C for 72 hours).  

Below a depth of 6 m, soil cores were taken every 1 m depth using a cylindrical auger 

with an inner diameter of 9 cm and a length of 30 cm. We used the same methodology 

as Christina et al. (2011a) to avoid contamination of the soil samples collected at depth 

by roots from the upper layers. Only soil blocks from the inner part of the auger were 

collected and all fragmented soil pieces likely to come from upper soil layers were 

systematically discarded. All the soil collected from each layer was put in plastic bag, 

identified and stored at 4°C until processing (within 2 months after sampling).

Figure 1 - Layout of the three treatments studied: Acacia mangium and Eucalyptus 
grandis monospecific stands (100A and 100E, respectively) and a mixed stand with 
50% of each species (50A50E). A. mangium trees are represented by grey circles and 
E. grandis trees by black triangles. Each inner plot (excluding two buffer rows) is 
delimited by a grey square. Three replicates samples (position indicated by a red cross) 
of soil cores were collected at mid distance between 4 adjacent trees in each plot down 
to a depth of 6 m and one sample per plot between the depths of 6 m and 17 m. Only 
one block is presented. A complete scheme of the trial is presented on Fig. 1 in Le 
Maire et al. (2013). 

 

All the fine roots in the samples were washed free of soil with tap water using sieves 

(with mesh sizes from 0.50 to 1.19 mm) and all the living roots with a length &gt;1 cm 

were separated carefully by hand. Dead roots separated by sight, touch and flotation, 

if required were discarded. Living roots were selected by various criteria such as living 

stele, bright color and elasticity. The color of the roots and the ramification pattern were 

good indications of the species to which they belonged. Reference roots sampled in 

monospecific stands were used to facilitate the identification of each species for roots 

collected in the 50A50E treatment. E. grandis fine roots were more branched and were 

darker than A. mangium fine roots. A sub-sample (10% of the weight of each soil 

sample) was used to estimate the mass of extremely fine roots (pieces of roots less 

than 1 cm in length). Extremely fine roots were separated carefully by hand in a white 

bucket filled with tap water. The mass of short root fragments (less than 1 cm in length) 

measured in 10% of the soil sample mass was multiplied by 10 to estimate the mass 

of those root fragments in the whole soil sample. All living fine roots with a length &gt;1 

cm separated from each soil sample were scanned (400 dpi resolution). Nodules were 

scanned with the fine roots when they were present. Root lengths and areas were 

estimated in each sample using WinRHIZO Version Pro V.2009c software (Regent 

Instruments, QC, Canada). Fine roots were dried for 72 h at 65 °C and weighed (±0.1 



233 
 

 

mg) to estimate specific root length (SRL, length of scanned roots divided by their dry 

mass mass, expressed in m g-1) and specific root area (SRA, surface area of scanned 

roots divided by their dry mass, expressed in cm2 g-1) in each soil sample. Fine-root 

mass density in each soil sample was calculated taking account of the soil dry mass 

used for the separation of the fine roots in the field and in the laboratory. Soil bulk 

densities measured in a pit down to a depth of 17 m in each treatment were used to 

convert fine-root mass densities expressed in g of root per kg of soil to g of root per 

dm3 of soil in each layer (the same method was used from the soil surface down to a 

depth of 17 m). Fine-root biomasses were computed in each soil layer multiplying the 

soil layer volume (dm3) by the mean fine-root density. Total root length and total root 

area in each soil sample were calculated by multiplying the total root dry mass by SRL 

and SRA, respectively. Root area index (RAI, surface area of fine roots divided by 

sampled soil area, expressed in m2 m-2) and root length index (RLI, length of scanned 

roots divided by sampled soil area, expressed in km m-2) (Jackson et al., 1997) were 

calculated for each soil layer in each treatment.  

5.2.4 Root ingrowth bags 

Fine-root production over two periods of 3 months were studied using cylindrical 

ingrowth bags constructed from stainless steel with a mesh size of 2 mm, a diameter 

of 9 cm and a height of 35 cm. The 3-month periods of root regrowth were selected for 

very fast eucalypt fine root growth, with maximum ingrowth core colonization after 2 

months, following a previous study at the same study site (see Figure.5 in Jourdan et 

al. (2008)). Three replicates of root ingrowth bags were installed at 4 depths (soil layers 

0.10-0.45 m, 1.00-1.35 m, 3.00-3.35 m and 6.00-6.35 m) in the same plots used to 

study the fine-root densities (three treatments in three blocks) giving a total of 108 

ingrowth bags for each period of 3 months. Holes (diameter 15 cm) were made 

manually (using the ‘cavadeira’ tool) to install the mesh bags at each depth (0.45 m, 

1.35 m, 3.35 m or 6.35 m). The bags were filled with the soil from the corresponding 

soil layer and moistened to field capacity after removing all the roots. The flexibility of 

the bags allowed a good contact with the surrounding soil. PVC pipes (diameter of 0.15 

m, length of 0.1 m, 1 m, 3 m or 6 m depending on the depth of the bag) were placed 

into the holes above the ingrowth bags to make possible to retrieve of each bag from 

the surface using a nylon cord attached (Appendix 



234 
 

 
 

Appendix 1 ). A plastic bag (with a nylon cord attached) filled with about 2 kg of soil 

was placed between the root ingrowth bag and the bottom of the PVC tube to avoid air 

diffusion from inside the PVC tube to the ingrowth bags that could affect fine-root 

growth. The top of each PVC tube was hermetically sealed. The mesh size of 2 mm 

allowed fine-root growth. After a period of 3 months, the bags were carefully retrieved.  

We set up additional ingrowth cores at the depths of 0.1 m and 1 m in the buffer rows 

of our experiment to check whether fine-roots were torn out when we pulled up the 

ingrowth cores 3 months after their installation. Destructive soil sampling close to the 

ingrowth cores showed that most of the fine roots of the two species were sheared by 

the stainless-steel mesh when the core was retrieved, and the biomass of fine roots 

not recovered inside the soil core was negligible. Two periods were studied: from July 

to September 2013 (winter) and October to December 2013 (spring). Just after the 

bags were retrieve, new bags were inserted at the same place to study the following 

3-month period. All the fine roots in the samples were washed free of soil with tap water 

using sieves and separated carefully by hand. The roots of the two species were 

distinguished in the 50A50E treatment as described above. 

5.2.5 Statistical analyses  

Two-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were used to assess the effects of 

treatments (100A, 100E and 50A50E) and blocks on fine-root densities (FRD), specific 

root length (SRL), specific root area (SRA), fine-root diameter, root length index (RLI) 

and root area index (RAI) for individual soil layers. Individual root biomass 

measurements within a given soil layer were considered independent since the 

sampling positions were located near different trees in each plot. We used linear 

mixed-effects models to test the effects of soil depth, treatment, and the interaction 

between depth and treatment (as fixed effect) on FRD, SRL, SRA, fine-root diameter, 

RLI and RAI for the whole soil profile. Blocks were considered as random effects and 

residues were modeled by a first-order autoregressive correlation model to account for 

the correlations between soil depths. A Shapiro-Wilk test was performed on the data 

before modeling and log-transformation was used when the residuals did not follow a 

normal distribution or were not homoscedasticity. In addition, two-way ANOVAs were 

carried out for each soil layer to compare the FRD of each tree species (E. grandis or 

A. mangium) in the mixed stands with 50% of the FRD in the monoculture of the same 



235 
 

 

species in the same block. The effects of treatments and depth on FRD in the ingrowth 

bags were tested using two-way ANOVAs for each 3-month period studied. Post-hoc 

differences were analysed using Tukey’s post-hoc Honest Significant Difference (HSD) 

to determine which means differed significantly between treatments. All calculations 

and analyses were performed using the R software version 3.2.2 (R development Core 

Team 2013) and the level of significance was 0.05. Linear mixed-effects models used 

the lmerTest package (Kuznetsova et al., 2015). For the graphical representations, the 

mean values and standard errors were calculated from all the replicates (n = 9 down 

to a depth of 6 m and n =3 below). 

5.3 Results 

5.3.1 Fine-root over-yielding  

Auger sampling down to the root front (maximum depth of root observation) showed 

that trees in 50A50E, 100A and 100E exhibited a similar pattern of deep rooting. Fine-

roots densities dropped sharply from the 0-0.5 m layer to the 0.5-1.0 m layer and 

decreased gradually down to a depth of 12 m in 100A and down to the water table at 

a depth of 17 m in 100E and 50A50E (Figure 2 ). Mixing E. grandis and A. mangium 

led to fine-root over-yielding. Fine-root biomass in 50A50E (1127 g m-2) was 44% 

higher than in 100A (780 g m-2) and 58% higher than in 100E (714 g m-2) (Table 2). 

Fine-root densities were 20-100% higher in 50A50E than in 100E and 100A in most of 

the soil layers and were at least twice as high in 50A50E as in 100A in soil layers 1.5 

- 2 m, 2 - 3 m, 3 - 4 m, and at depths &gt; 8 m. Low fine-root densities at depths &gt; 8 m in 

100A were consistent with higher soil water contents in 100A than in 100E and 50A50E 

(Figure 2 ).

5.3.2 Fine-root distribution of each species in monospecific stands vs mixed stands 

Intra- and inter-specific interactions strongly influenced the distribution of A. mangium 

and E. grandis fine roots, irrespective of the soil layer (Table 4 ). The total fine-root 

biomass of A. mangium trees in 50A50E was 54% of the biomass in 100A, whereas 

the planting density was only 50% of that in 100A, with the slightly lower exploration of 

the 0-2 m soil layer than in 100A offset by a higher exploration of very deep soil layers 

(Figure 3). E. grandis fine-root biomass was only 2% lower in 50A50E than in 100E, 

despite the stocking density being 50% lower (Figure 3). E. grandis fine-root biomass 

in 50A50E was significantly higher than 50% of that in 100E in all layers except 1-2 m 

and 4–6 m. Even though the fine-root biomass was low between the depths of 9 and 

12 m in all the treatments (about 6% of the total fine-root biomass), A. mangium and 

E. grandis fine-root biomasses at this depth were 2-3 times higher in 50A50E than in 

the monospecific stands where the stocking density of each species was twice as high 

(Figure 3).

5.3.3 Fine-root traits of each species in monospecific stands vs mixed stands 

Total fine-root length index (RLI) was 30 km m-2 in 50A50E and was double that in 

100A (13 km m-2) and in 100E (15 km m-2) (Figure 5 ). The RLIs in soil layers 0-1 m, 

2-4 m, 4-6 m and 9-17 m were significantly higher in 50A50E than in 100A and 100E. 

Total fine-root area index (RAI) was 28 m2 m-2 in 50A50E and was significantly higher 

than in 100A (20 m2 m-2) and 100E (19 m2 m-2) (Figure 5 ).While about 50% of the total 

RAI was found in the top 1 m soil layer in 50A50E (12.7 m2 m-2) and 100A (8.2 m2 m-

2), only 22% of the total RAI was found in the top 1 m in 100E (4.2 m2 m-2) and a high 

proportion of the total RAI was in the 1-2 m soil layer (5.8 m2 m-2). The RAI at depths 

&gt; 4 m was about 6 m2 m-2, irrespective of the treatment. 

While specific root length (SRL) and specific root area (SRA) were significantly higher 

in 50A50E than in the monospecific stands, the mean fine-root diameter was 

significantly higher in 100A than in 100E and 50A50E (Table 2, Table 3). Down to a 

depth of 6 m, mean values of SRL were 18.0, 20.5 and 34.9 m g-1 in 100A, 100E and 

50A50E, respectively, and the mean values of SRA were 268, 254 and 433 cm2 g-1 

(Table 2). Mean fine-root diameter was 0.53 mm in 100A, and 0.47 mm in 100E and 

50A50E. Depth had little effect on SRL, SRA and fine-root diameter for either species, 

irrespective of the treatment (Figure 4 ). 

Mixing A. mangium and E. grandis trees led to a significant increase in SRL and SRA 

for the roots of both species (Table 2, Table 3) while the mean fine-root diameter was 

significantly lower in mixed stands than in monoculture for A. mangium but not for E. 

grandis. SRL and SRA of A. mangium roots were 2 to 6 times higher in 50A50E than 

in 100A down to a depth of 2 m while the differences between treatments decreased 

at depths &gt; 2 m (Figure 4 ). The highest difference between the A. mangium root traits 

in 50A50E and in 100A was in the topsoil. In the top 0.5 m layer, the mean SRL of A. 

mangium fine roots was 72 m g-1 in 50A50E vs 11 m g-1 in 100A and the mean SRA 

was 848 cm2 g-1 in 50A50E vs 187 cm2 g-1 in 100A. Even though the mean diameter 

of A. mangium roots was higher in 100A than in 50A50E in all the soil layers down to 

a depth of 6 m, the differences between treatments were not significant in each 

individual layer (Figure 4 ).

5.3.4 Capacity to explore soil patches 

Mean fine-root production in the ingrowth bags reached 0.048 ± 0.025 g dm-3 month-1 

in 50A50E across the two trimesters and the four depths studied and was 63% higher 

than the average of 100A and 100E (Figure 6 ). Surprisingly, the effect of soil depth on 

fine-root production in the ingrowth bags was not significant. Fine-root production in 

the ingrowth bags increased by 268% in 100A, 42% in 100E and 33% in 50A50E from 

the first 3-month period (winter, dry season) to the second (spring). Fine-root 

production was significantly higher in 100E and 50A50E than in 100A. In individual soil 

layers, fine-root production was not significantly different between 50A50E and 100E, 

but significantly higher than in 100A at depths 3-3.35 m and 6-6.35 m in winter and at 

depths 0.1-0.45 m and 1-1.35 m in spring.  



245 
 

 

The fine-root production of each species in 50A50E and 50% of the production in 

monospecific stands showed a strong seasonality (Figure 6 ). While the production of 

A. mangium roots in winter in the ingrowth bags tended to be higher in 50A50E than 

50% of that produced in 100A, it was lower in spring. The production of E. grandis roots 

in the ingrowth bags in winter was slightly higher in 50A50E than 50% of the root 

biomass produced in 100E in soil layers 1 - 1.35 m and 6 - 6.35 m, and 5 times higher 

in the 3 - 3.35 m soil layer. In spring, the production of E. grandis roots in the ingrowth 

bags was 2-3 times higher in 50A50E than 50% of the production in 100E in the upper 

soil layers (0.1 - 0.45 m and 1 - 1.35 m depths) and close to 50% of the root production 

in 100E in deep soil layers (3 - 3.35 m and 6-6.35 m depths).

5.4 Discussion 

5.4.1 Fine-root over-yielding in very deep soil layers 

The main purpose of this study was to investigate whether roots explore very deep soil 

layers more intensively in mixed-species stands than in monospecific stands. In 

agreement with our first hypothesis, mixing A. mangium and E. grandis trees led to a 

strong fine-root over-yielding in all soil layers down to the water table at a depth of 17 

m. Although fine-root over-yielding has already been reported in the upper soil layers 

for mixed stands compared to monospecific stands (Brassard et al., 2013; Laclau et 

al., 2013c; Lei et al., 2012), the opposite has also been reported (Bolte &amp;amp; Villanueva, 

2006), and other studies have shown similar fine-root biomasses in mixed and 

monospecific stands (Bauhus et al., 2000; Meinen et al., 2009). A recent global meta-

analysis across forests, grasslands, croplands and pot systems showed that mixed 

stands had, on average 28% higher fine-root biomass and 45% higher annual 

production than monocultures (Ma &amp;amp; Chen, 2016). The originality of our results come 

from the strong fine-root over-yielding observed in soil layers at depths &gt; 2 m. 

Competition for water and nutrients with the neighboring trees in mixed stands may 

force the roots to explore and tap deep soil layers (Cardinael et al., 2015; Ma &amp;amp; Chen, 

2017). While most of the studies dealing with fine-root distribution in forests have been 

limited to the upper 2 m of soil, 35%, 45% and 50% of the total fine-root biomass was 

found below 2 m in 100A, 50A50E and 100E, respectively. The difficulty of sampling 

deep roots can lead to underestimates of root mass and belowground productivity in 

tropical plantations and forests (Maeght et al., 2015b; Pierret et al., 2016b). Studies 

quantifying total fine-root biomass down to the root front are scarce for trees growing 

in very deep tropical soils. Close to our study site (on the same soil type), the proportion 

of fine roots below 2 m depth was 20-30% of the total fine-root biomass down to the 

root front in a sweet orange orchard (Adriano et al., 2017) and 30-60% of the total fine-

root length, depending on tree age, in eucalypt plantations (Laclau et al., 2013b; 

Pinheiro et al., 2016a). As commonly reported in forest ecosystems, fine-root densities 

dropped rapidly within the first topsoil layers then decreased gradually with soil depth, 

which corresponds to the distribution of nutrients in soil profiles (Weemstra et al., 

2017). Interactions between tree species greatly increase the exploration of very deep 

soil layers in our study, which is likely to enhance the uptake of soil resources. 



248 
 

 
 

Establishing a deep root system can also help tropical trees withstand the prolonged 

droughts that are expected to increase in the future (Christina et al., 2017a; Solomon 

et al., 2009). A modeling approach in a nearby eucalypt stand of similar productivity 

showed that very low densities of fine roots at depths &gt; 10 m can withdraw substantial 

amounts of water during dry periods (Christina et al., 2017a). Mixing tree species could 

therefore enhance the resilience of tropical planted forests to climate changes 

increasing the access to water and nutrients stored in very deep soil layers.  

Fine-root over-yielding in 50A50E is also consistent with the higher soil respiration 

rates relative to 100A and 100E at the end of the previous rotation (Nouvellon et al., 

2012b). Roots are a major contributor to soil respiration (Gill et al., 2002; Marsden et 

al., 2008) and about 25% of terrestrial net primary production is due to fine-root 

production and turnover (McCormack et al., 2015). The total belowground C fluxes 

from 4 to 6 years after planting in the previous rotation of our experiment represented 

24%, 26% and 32% of the gross primary production in 100A, 100E and 50A50E, 

respectively (Nouvellon et al., 2012b). Large amounts of C are stored at great depths 

in tropical soils (Batjes, 2014) and changes in land use increasing the supply of fresh 

carbon might promote the activity of microbes through a priming effect (Derrien et al., 

2014b; Fontaine et al., 2007). The increase in fine-root biomass, by replacing 

monospecific stands by mixed-species, may have consequences on soil carbon 

sequestration in deep soil layers that are poorly understood. Further studies are 

needed to assess whether an increase in the release of fresh C in very deep soil layers 

resulting from the combination of tree species could contribute to mitigating climate 

change through a sequestration of C or, on the contrary, would promote the 

mineralization of ancient C and therefore increase CO2 emissions. 

5.4.2 Root strategies in response to intra- and inter-specific interactions 

In agreement with our second hypothesis, the interaction mechanisms between E. 

grandis and A. mangium trees led to large changes in A. mangium fine-root 

morphology. Previous studies at the same experimental site showed that E. grandis 

trees dominate the competition with A. mangium trees capturing more light per tree 

and taking advantage of N fixation (Paula et al., 2015). The A. mangium leaves are 

below the canopy of eucalypt trees in mixed stands and fine roots are partially excluded 

from the upper soil layer (Laclau et al., 2013c; Le Maire et al., 2013). A. mangium trees 



249 
 

 

adopt an intensification strategy (Bonifas &amp;amp; Lindquist, 2009; Lei et al., 2012; Ostonen 

et al., 2007a) in competition with eucalypts, making it possible to increase the capacity 

to take up soil resources for a relatively low investment in belowground biomass. SRL 

and SRA of A. mangium fine roots in mixed stands were 2-3 times higher than in 

monoculture, which, in combination with a large increase in FRD, led to a much higher 

root length index and root area index. While some studies in forest ecosystems also 

showed higher SRL and SRA in mixed stands than in monospecific stands, making it 

possible to reduce the cost/benefit ratio for resource capture (Beyer et al., 2013; Lei et 

al., 2012; Sun et al., 2017; Weemstra et al., 2016), those root traits were similar in 

mixed-species plantations and monocultures of A. mearnsii and E. globulus in Australia 

(Bauhus et al., 2000). In our study, A. mangium faced competition with E. grandis by 

altering the root absorption capacity, much more through morphological adaptations 

than changing the fine-root biomass of each A. mangium tree.  

C starvation affecting the fine root architecture of A. mangium trees dominated by 

eucalypts as well as changes in mycorrhizal status seem to be potential factors. A 

recent study carried out in the same experiment showed large changes in the 

microbiological and chemical attributes of soil between the 100A and 50A50E 

treatments (Bini et al., 2013), which suggests that changes in mycorrhizal status might 

be contribute to explaining the effect of eucalypts on the SRL and SRA of A. mangium 

roots. However, the mycorrhizal status was not directly measured, and we can only 

speculate about this effect. Differences in nodulation might contribute to explaining this 

pattern. Indeed, nodule density was much higher in monospecific A. mangium stands 

than in mixed A. mangium and E. grandis stands in the previous rotation at this site 

(Bouillet et al., 2008). However, nodules were mainly observed in the 0-50 cm soil layer 

and their density was low in the scanned roots. 

Our results confirm the fine-root segregation between the two species in the mixed 

stand observed for  the previous rotation at this site (da Silva et al., 2009; Laclau et al., 

2013c), with a partial exclusion of A. mangium roots from the resource-rich upper soil 

layers in mixed stands and a higher exploration of deep soil layers. However, the 

methodology was less intensive than in the previous studies of this effect (only one 

distance to the trees was sampled here and the 0-50 cm soil layer was not divided in 

several layers). 



250 
 

 
 

Eucalyptus grandis trees respond to competition with A. mangium trees through both 

an extensification strategy, leading to a sharp increase in fine-root biomass relative to 

monospecific stands, and an intensification strategy, increasing the volume of capture 

of soil resources relative to the fine-root biomass. However, the changes in SRL, SRA 

and fine-root diameter were non-significant in most of the soil layers, which suggests 

that the contribution of the intensification strategy was low. SRL and SRA values in our 

study are in the range reported down to a depth of 12 m for four Eucalyptus genotypes 

in nearby plantations (Pinheiro et al., 2016a). The total biomass of E. grandis fine roots 

was similar in 50A50E and in 100E despite a stocking density of eucalypt trees twice 

as high in 100E, which shows a remarkable plasticity of eucalypt trees to explore a 

huge soil volume, as already shown in Laclau et al. (2013c). In boreal forests, a 

comparison of fine-root production in mixed and single-species stands showed that 

fine-root production was correlated with nitrogen concentrations in the soil layers, and 

suggested that an enhancement of N availability in the mixed stands contributed to 

increasing fine-root production (Ma &amp;amp; Chen, 2017). We, therefore, speculate that 

facilitation mechanisms for E. grandis trees planted with A. mangium resulting from an 

increase in soil N availability (Tchichelle et al., 2017; Voigtlaender et al., 2012), could 

be involved in the extensification strategy leading to an increase in soil exploration by 

E. grandis fine roots. Such pattern might be pronounced in the superficial soil layers 

where eucalypt trees benefit from a rapid belowground N transfer from A. mangium 

trees  (Paula et al., 2015). 

While many studies show that SRL, SRA and fine-root diameter can change depending 

on soil depth (Bakker et al., 2009; Makita et al., 2011; Maurice et al., 2010; Prieto et 

al., 2015), we did not observe clear patterns down the soil profile for either species. 

The same type of study carried out down to the root front in other eucalypt and orange 

plantations in Brazil also showed a high variability of SRL, SRA and fine-root diameter 

between soil layers but without a clear correlation with the depth (Adriano et al., 2017; 

Pinheiro et al., 2016a). A study carried out in 20 plant communities sampled in tropical, 

Mediterranean and montane regions showed that some fine-root traits were 

significantly different between shallow and deep soil layers, but absolute differences 

were small for most of the traits measured (Prieto et al., 2015). Our results suggest 

that E. grandis and A. mangium fine roots in mixed stands reflect an acquisitive 

resource strategy (Freschet et al., 2017; McCormack et al., 2015). Further studies in 



251 
 

 

eucalypt and acacia plantations should examine other important root traits (in particular 

tissue density, concentrations of nutrients, cellulose, lignin and carbohydrate) to gain 

insight into the cost to the trees of investing in fine-root production in very deep soil 

layers. 

5.4.3 Fine-root production   

Even though the fine-root production of A. mangium and E. grandis trees exhibited a 

strong seasonal variability, the decrease in fine-root density with soil depth did not 

modify the production of fine roots in the ingrowth bags down to a depth of 6 m. This 

pattern is contrary to our third hypothesis and shows a huge capacity of very deep 

roots to explore resource-rich soil patches despite their low density in the soil. The 

production of fine roots in the ingrowth bags was however much higher for E. grandis 

trees than for A. mangium trees, which is consistent with the faster growth rates of E. 

grandis trees shown both aboveground and belowground (da Silva et al., 2009; 

Nouvellon et al., 2012b). Fine-root production in the ingrowth bags confirmed the 

strong over-yielding in mixed-species stands relative to the monocultures suggested 

by the fine-root densities. However, fine roots sampled in ingrowth bags can be 

different from fine roots sampled in undisturbed soil and productions estimated from 

ingrowth bags should be interpreted with caution (Bauhus &amp;amp; Messier, 1999; Jourdan 

et al., 2008). Nevertheless, the same ingrowth bags were installed at all the depths in 

all the treatments, making it possible to compare the capacity of fine roots to explore 

soil patches. 

The production of A. mangium fine roots in the ingrowth bags was much more affected 

by the season (winter vs spring) in the topsoil than in deep soil layers, as reported for 

phreatophytic species (Canham et al., 2012). E. grandis trees are better adapted to 

the cold climate in winter at our study site than A. mangium trees, which could account 

for the higher fine-root production in the topsoil in E. grandis monoculture and mixed-

species stands than in A. mangium monoculture. A strong influence of exogenous 

factors such as soil temperature and water content (Canham et al., 2015), as well as 

endogenous factors such as photosynthate availability, on fine-root phenology is well 

documented (McCormack et al., 2015). 



252 
 

 
 

In conclusion, our study shows that mixing species can lead to a strong fine-root over-

yielding in very deep soil layers. We demonstrate that E. grandis and A. mangium trees 

growing in mixed stands can explore more intensively deep soil layers than their 

respective monospecific stands. Studies dealing with deep rooting are needed for other 

tree species, soils and climates to assess whether increasing the diversity in tropical 

planted forests could increase their resilience to climate change by providing access 

to more soil resources than monospecific stands. A better comprehension of the effects 

of fine-root growth and turnover in very deep soil layers on soil carbon stocks is also 

needed to better assess the long-term consequences of afforestation with fast-growing 

tree species on the global carbon cycle.

GENERAL DISCUSSION AND PERSPECTIVES 

The general objective of this study was to assess the effect of clear-cutting Eucalyptus 

stands managed in coppice on fine root production as well as CO2, N2O and CH4 fluxes 

throughout the entire soil profile, down to the water table, with a focus at great depth. 

The study was carried out in Eucalyptus plantations in Brazil, which has already been 

proven to be an excellent model to understand more precisely aboveground and 

belowground ecophysiological and biogeochemical processes (BATTIE-LACLAU et 

al., 2016; LACLAU et al., 2010; PRADIER et al., 2017). Two contrasting water regimes 

were studied to gain insight into the effects of drought periods that are predicted to be 

more frequent over the next decades. The current, natural water regime (+ W) was 

compared to a reduced water regime (-W), simulating a reduction in precipitation of 

about one third. Fine roots and greenhouse gases were sampled down to the water 

table (here located at a depth of 17 m) through large and deep wells, over one year 

before the clear-cut and two years after harvesting, in coppice-managed plantations 

as well as down to a depth of 4 m in a non-harvested plot (NH) serving as a control. 

This study aimed to test four hypotheses: 1/ Eucalyptus trees are able to adapt their 

fine root dynamics depending on their environment to better access the soil resources,  

2/ a change in fine root dynamics can occur between the topsoil and deep soil horizons 

when trees are subjected to drought conditions, 3/ throughfall exclusion can 

significantly affect greenhouse gas production and consumption within the soil profile 

by modifying gas diffusivity, 4/ coppice management increases the efflux of GHG as a 

result of fine root mortality and decomposition of harvest residues. The consequences 

of tree harvesting on fine root dynamics and the production of greenhouse gases over 

the first year of the rotation in coppice-managed plantations ask specific questions 

never studied in very deep soil layers. 

Through this work, we wanted to answer four scientific questions: 

1. What are the dynamics of eucalypt fine roots, CO2, N2O and CH4 

concentrations throughout the entire soil profile down to a depth of 17 m? 

 

2. Are fine root dynamics and fine root traits differently impacted by a change in 

water regime depending on soil depth? 

 



262 
 

 
 

3. What are the consequences of drought on greenhouse gas production in 

eucalypt plantations established in deep Ferralsols?  

 

4. How clear-cutting affect root production and mortality but also greenhouse gas 

production in coppice-managed eucalypt plantations? 

The work in this thesis consisted in collecting greenhouse gases down to a depth of 

15.5 m, measuring greenhouse gas effluxes, collecting root samples down to the water 

table and monitoring root dynamics over 3 years (Chapters 2 and 3). This approach 

provided original results on fine root dynamics and greenhouse gas production in very 

deep soil layers in coppice-managed Eucalyptus plantation subjected to two contrasted 

rainfall regimes. A modeling approach was then used to gain insight into the processes 

governing CO2 transfer at a local scale but revealed several issues that we could not 

overcome over the available time of 6 months at the end of the thesis (Additional work). 

Finally, this last chapter aims at discussing the results obtained throughout the thesis 

and is organized in two parts. In the first one, we discuss the contribution of deep roots 

in tree adaptation to drought conditions and the importance of considering the entire 

soil profile when evaluating stand-scale greenhouse gases emissions. In the second, 

we argue, according to an operational point of view, that coppice management might 

be an interesting option in tropical plantations to improve tree tolerance to drought and 

store carbon in deep soil layers.  

Scientific discussion: contribution for global concepts 

Effect of climate change on forest plantations: Let’s look deeper!  

Understanding the effects of climate changes, predicting its potential impacts and 

anticipating adaptation is mandatory for the sustainability of fiber and food production 

in a context of increasing human population. If greenhouse gas emissions maintain 

their current increase, climate change may increase the vulnerability of agricultural and 

forestry systems and reduce production in some parts of the world. Perennial 

plantations will be particularly affected by climate change, because a plot planted today 

must be able to cope with all the climatic conditions that will be encountered up to tree 

harvest, from a few years to several decades after planting. Predicting accurately the 

future climate is challenging. It requires complex models that consider many processes 

that can potentially greatly influence the predictions when the model is sensitive to 

some parameters. Yet, many processes are still not completely understood for deep 



263 
 

 

rooted species, especially for the ones occurring at great soil depth. Deep rooting is 

common in tropical forests (CANADELL et al., 1996; JACKSON et al., 2000; NEPSTAD 

et al., 1994)  where severe drought events are predicted to occur over the next 

decades. In tropical forest plantations, it is then crucial to focus the research efforts on 

the understanding of deep soil processes to assess the potential impacts of climate 

changes.  

Current climate models predict a reduction in rainfall associated with an intensification 

of dry seasons in many parts of the word, and in Brazil particularly. Assessing how 

trees will adapt to climate changes is a major challenge. Therefore, field 

experimentations simulating future climates are crucial to parameterize 

biogeochemical global models making it possible to predict how ecosystems will 

respond to climate changes. 

Anthropogenic climate changes are caused mainly by greenhouse gas (GHG) 

emissions. GHGs refer to all gases of natural or anthropogenic origin that contribute to 

the greenhouse effect. Potential efficiency of greenhouse gases regarding global 

warming is highly variable. By definition, the overall global warming potential of CO2 is 

equal to 1 and CH4 and N2O are 23 and 298 times more efficient to warm the earth 

over a 100-year period as compared to CO2, respectively. In the early 1990s, through 

the multiplication of scientific evidence and international conferences on climate 

(including the conference of Kyoto in 1997), the international community has become 

aware of the potential importance for climate changes of increasing concentrations of 

anthropogenic GHGs in the atmosphere (mainly CO2, N2O and CH4) and the need to 

reduce them. To reduce the concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere, two types of 

actions can be considered: 

1. Decrease sources, in other words, reduce the level of GHG emissions. 

2. Increase sinks, in other words, favor the transfer and storage of GHGs in other 

compartments where they would be stabilized, for example, in the form of 

carbonate sediments, woody plant biomass and / or stabilized organic matter. 

Our study puts forward the need to consider deep soil layers to evaluate both actions. 

Indeed, it is mandatory to study deep soil layers in order to quantify accurately C 

source/sink fluxes as part of the global carbon budget. Quantifying C fluxes in deep 

soil layers is needed to improve the biogeochemical models predicting the effect of 



264 
 

 
 

drought periods on greenhouse gas effluxes, and to identify more sustainable 

silvicultural practices for tropical planted forests in a context of climate changes. 

Looking deeper to quantify sinks accurately   

Our study in a 2-ha split-plot experimental design manipulating water availability 

contributed to evaluating the impact of rainfall reduction on the productivity and 

adaptability of Eucalyptus plantation in a context of global change. Our results clearly 

show that Eucalyptus trees facing drought invest more in belowground biomass to 

increase the exploration of fine roots in deep soil layers (Figure 1 ). This adaptive 

strategy to drought stress of perennial plant species, investing assimilates to develop 

the deep root system, increases the availability of water stored in very deep soil layers 

to maintain tree growth during drought periods (CHRISTINA et al., 2017). Furthermore, 

the increased surface of root in contact with soil through an adjustment of fine root 

morphology (SRA, SRL, diameter, Figure 1 ) reflects a significant expression of root 

plasticity in response to limited soil resources (FORT et al., 2015; HODGE, 2004; 

ROUMET et al., 2016).  

A higher investment in deep roots in response to a rainfall reduction might also 

influence other key processes such as tree functional status (i.e. growth and 

senescence), C rhizodeposition and rhizosphere biogeochemical properties. For 

instance, we found a non-negligible production of greenhouse gases down to the water 

table, probably resulting from the respiration of fine roots and their decomposition at 

depths of more than 10 m. On the other hand, deep roots might also contribute to 

sequestrating large amounts of C in soils (PIERRET et al., 2016). We showed that fine 

root biomass increased in deep soil layers when the plantation was subjected to water 

deficit (Figure 1 ). As long-term C sequestration is more likely to occur in deep soil 

horizons than in the topsoil (GILL E BURKE, 2002), the increased C allocation to fine 

roots in deep soil layers could have significant role for mitigating global changes.  

Consequently, because changing precipitations can greatly modify C allocation 

between soil layers, C sequestration must be studied not only the topsoil, but also 

throughout the whole soil profile explored by roots.

Looking deeper to quantify sources accurately 

Several studies reported that total below-ground carbon allocations account for 20-

30% of gross primary production in Eucalyptus plantations (EPRON et al., 2012; 

NOUVELLON et al., 2012; RYAN et al., 2010). The results of our study emphasize that 

Eucalyptus roots do not only represent a non-negligible part of the biomass of the trees, 

but also that a large proportion is allocated at great depth, especially under drought 

conditions (Figure 2 ). This is particularly of interest considering that plants play a major 

role in sequestrating CO2 from the atmosphere into the soil. In order to assess the 

carbon fluxes from the soil to the atmosphere, we conducted measurements of CO2 

fluxes along the soil profile and at the soil surface. 

CO2 productions estimated with the diffusivity model were strongly correlated to the 

distribution of fine root biomass along the soil profile, down to a depth of 15.5 m. The 

CO2 production shifted to deep soil layer in response to throughfall exclusion, which 

could be due to a shift of root growth to deep layers likely to enhance tree water supply 

(SCHWENDENMANN et al., 2010; SOTTA et al., 2007). When decomposed, a part of 

the dead root tissues is incorporated into the soil organic matter (STRAND et al., 2008). 

Microorganisms can be reactivated in response to the input of fresh organic matter. 

Specialized microorganisms develop rapidly and break down fresh organic matter. 

Their metabolites can activate a second class of specialized microorganisms, in 

dormancy, which can degrade the organic matter initially present and stored in the soil: 

this is the "priming effect" (FONTAINE et al., 2003). Changes in deep soil conditions 

in response to water deficit might affect considerably the functioning and composition 

of microbial communities and therefore the production of CH4, CO2 and N2O. A study 

down to a depth of 4 m at the same site showed that total organic C and N 

concentrations in the rhizosphere increased with depth and in response to throughfall 

exclusion (PRADIER, 2016). This increase can be explained by two major processes: 

(i) the increase in the quantity of organic compounds released by deep roots, and/or 

(ii) an identical amount of organic compounds released but a difference in their 

residence time within the rhizosphere (PRADIER, 2016). It is therefore essential to 

clarify the functional role of deep roots and associated microbial communities to 

estimate adequately the overall C sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions in 

tropical ecosystems.  



266 
 

 
 

Furthermore, the production of greenhouse gases shifted over depth under dry 

conditions in this study, showing that it is important to simulate the changes along the 

entire soil profile in biochemical models to estimate CO2 emissions under future 

conditions. Therefore, only considering greenhouse gas production in the topsoil layers 

will not be adequate to evaluate the impact of climate changes in tropical forest 

ecosystems over long time periods.  

Operational discussion: consequences for the management of tropical 

planted forests 

Eucalyptus plantations are not natural forests and are devoted to the provision of wood 

products, as viticulture is devoted to wine production or coffee plantations to coffee 

production. The sustainability of Eucalyptus plantations requires the control of criteria 

and indicators of sustainable ecological and social management practices, but also 

economic and institutional aspects. Eucalyptus plantations cover large areas 

worldwide, with more than 20 million hectares. The large production of wood in fast-

growing plantations helps to reduce the pressure on native forest to supply wood and 

especially the high emissions of greenhouse gases caused by deforestation. However, 

much remains to be done regarding environmental impacts, sustainable management 

and adaptation to global change in order to reconcile production issues and 

preservation of natural resources. In this perspective, our study contributes to 

demonstrating that coppice management of Eucalyptus plantations could be an 

interesting trade-off between economic, societal and environmental requirements. 

Coppice-managed forest plantations: an option to limit GHG emissions 

Regeneration of forest plantation by sprouting is a viable alternative for many 

production systems. More and more forest companies opt for coppice-managed 

Eucalyptus plantations instead of systematic replanting for cost and profitability 

reasons (GONÇALVES et al., 2014). About one third of commercial Eucalyptus 

plantations in Brazil have been managed in coppice management since 2010 (IBA, 

2016). However, the consequences of this type of management on the functioning of 

deep roots have never been investigated in tropical planted forests. 

Such a research effort is a prerequisite to orient the management of tropical planted 

forests toward a limitation of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. Our study 



267 
 

 

shows that managing the eucalypt plantations in coppice after cutting the previous 

stand did not led to an increase in CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions (Figure 2 ). Fine root 

mortality was very low the first year after the clear-cut when the plantation was coppice-

managed (Figure 1 ). The management in coppice after the clear-cut did not increase 

the production of dead roots and the subsequent release of CO2 resulting to fine root 

decomposition. Furthermore, coppiced-managed plantations are less prone to erosion 

compared to replanted stands because the soil is exposed for a shorter period 

(BERHONGARAY et al., 2017). Hence, coppice management might be an interesting 

option in tropical Eucalyptus plantations, to help mitigate the increase in CO2, CH4 and 

N2O in the atmosphere and to limit soil erosion compared to systematic replanting. 

Coppice-managed forest plantations: an option for areas of climatic constraints  

Our study also showed that coppice management for Eucalyptus plantation might be 

a promising option to face water scarcity. Indeed, we found an intensive root growth in 

very deep soil layers (depth &gt; 14m) less than one year after the clear-cut, with only 

few roots lost by mortality.  These findings are particularly impressive considering that 

E. grandis roots typically reach only a depth of 7 m at one year after planting in 

systematic replanting (CHRISTINA et al., 2011; LACLAU et al., 2013). Root production 

and maintenance represent a significant cost to a plant’s overall economy.  The 

establishment of a deep root system requires the allocation belowground of large 

amounts of carbon, which is at the expense of the production of aboveground biomass. 

By maintaining the root system, coppice-managed Eucalyptus plantations preserve 

belowground biomass for the next generation. Our results suggest that the carbon cost 

to maintain the root system down to the water table could be lower than shedding roots 

and producing new roots when the plantation is coppice managed. Six-year-old 

Eucalyptus grandis trees in our experiment have enough reserves within the root 

system, with or without throughfall exclusion, and the appropriate edaphic surrounding 

conditions to maintain the fine root biomass after clear-cutting, which probably 

contributed to promoting the early shoot growth (BRUNNER et al., 2015; DRAKE et 

al., 2013).  

The maintenance of a deep root system represents a double "safety net" for nutrients 

and for water uptake that are taken up throughout the entire soil profile before being 

lost for tree growth by deep drainage (MARESCHAL et al., 2013). In tropical 



268 
 

 
 

Eucalyptus plantations growing on highly weathered soils in regions with rainfall events 

of high intensity, deep roots can provide access to large amounts of water stored in 

the subsoil and can play a crucial role in nutrient capture, which is essential to avoid 

large losses of nutrients leached from the upper horizons (LACLAU et al., 2010). 

Therefore, the pre-established root system in coppice-managed plantations can act as 

a safety net by catching up large amounts of nutrient released after tree harvest and 

probably contribute to reducing the risk of tree mortality during prolonged dry periods.

Contributions of the study and perspectives 

The outputs of this work are multiple (Figure 1 , Figure 2 ) To our knowledge, it is the 

first time that fine root dynamics and greenhouse gas concentrations and productions 

are studied down to the water table (here at a depth of 17 m) in Eucalyptus plantations. 

The effects of water deficit in interaction with the consequences of clear-cutting in 

coppiced-managed Eucalyptus plantations have never been studied.   

However, further studies dealing with the anatomical, architectural and functional 

characteristics of fine roots across very deep soil profiles should be carried out. These 

studies would help gain an insight into the potential impact of management practices 

on C, water and nutrient cycles in tropical regions. A better knowledge of microbial 

communities in terms of biomass and diversity, but especially in terms of metabolic 

capacity is also needed. Improving our understanding of the factors controlling 

microbial activity, nutrient and C availability and their interactions in deep soil layers is 

a major scientific lock to model the global biogeochemical cycles (FIERER et al., 2003; 

JONES et al., 2018; SOSA-HERNANDEZ et al., 2018). 

From a methodological point of view, the field measurements in our study showed the 

great variability of GHG effluxes and the importance of monitoring the determinants of 

these emissions. Unlike micro-meteorological techniques, the closed-chamber method 

is simple, relatively inexpensive and can be installed on any type of field (forest, 

cultivated field, grassland ...). Problems related to the use of closed-chambers (leaks, 

overpressure ...) can be avoided or minimized by an adapted methodology. The main 

limitation of this technique is the small area covered by the measurement, which may 

not encompass large-scale processes. A large number of samples in each treatment 

were set to catch the potential intra-plot variability, but those sampling efforts required 

a significant labor load and the measurements remained punctual in time and space. 

The use of automatic chambers allows to better capture the temporal fluctuations of 

greenhouse gas emissions (MAKITA et al., 2018). This is particularly an advantage in 

places where environmental factors, contributing to the regulation of greenhouse gas 

emissions (such as soil temperature), lead to large differences in daytime / nighttime 

GHG effluxes. 

In situ measurements are needed to explore the dynamics of greenhouse gas 

concentrations throughout soil profiles. However, manual in situ measurements require 



274 
 

 
 

a lot of time and resources and are therefore often limited in time and space. Modeling 

makes it possible to interpolate in space and time the data acquired punctually. These 

interpolations are particularly interesting for the greenhouse gas effluxes that are 

characterized by strong spatial and temporal variations, as observed in this study. The 

sensibility of model outputs to specific processes can also be assessed by analyzing 

the differences between experimental and simulated data. Moreover, models can be 

used to assess the consequences of contrasting scenarios on greenhouse gas 

production. Nevertheless, the mechanistic modeling of GHG effluxes still presents 

many uncertainties because the main factors used in the models (mineral N dynamics, 

water contents, organic C contents, soil temperatures, soil pH,…) and their interactions 

are not fully understood, in particular throughout deep soil profiles. Understanding how 

precipitation changes, and especially extended drought periods, influence greenhouse 

gas production in deep soils is crucial to improve the prediction of terrestrial biosphere 

models. 

While many studies continue to consider only the upper 30 centimeters of soil, this 

work highlights the urgent need to study deep soil horizons in a context of climate 

change, not only for the evaluation of the changes in soil carbon sequestration, but 

also to quantify accurately the production of greenhouse gases. Comprehensive 

studies dealing with the microbial ecology of deep soil horizons in response to 

environmental changes and management practices are crucial to predict the behavior 

of huge soil volumes over the next decades.
