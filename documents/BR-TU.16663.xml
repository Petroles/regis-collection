The State Reform processes combined with the emergence and use of Information and Communication Technology 
(ICT) originated electronic government policies and initiatives in Brazil.  This paper dwells on Brazilian e-government by 
investigating the institutional design it assumed in the state’s public sphere, and how it contributed to outcomes related to 
e-gov possibilities.  The analyses were carried out under an interpretativist perspective by making use of Institutional Theory.  
From the analyses of interviews with relevant actors in the public sphere, such as state secretaries and presidents of public 
ICT companies, conclusions point towards low institutionalization of e-gov policies.  The institutional design of Brazilian 
e-gov limits the use of ICT to provide integrated public services, to amplify participation and transparency, and to improve 
public policies management.

no Brasil, a políticas e ações de governo eletrônico. Este artigo debruça-se sobre o e-governo brasileiro, investigando o desenho institucional que ele 
assumiu na esfera estadual do país e como contribui para os resultados associados às possibilidades do e-gov. Numa perspectiva interpretativista, 
utilizou-se a Teoria Institucional como lente teórica no exame do campo. A partir da análise de entrevistas feitas a atores relevantes na esfera dos estados 
brasileiros, tais como secretários de estado e presidentes de empresas públicas de informática, as conclusões apontam para a baixa institucionalização 
das políticas de e-governo. O desenho institucional do governo eletrônico brasileiro limita a utilização das TIC na prestação de serviços públicos 
integrados, na ampliação de participação e transparência, e no aprimoramento de políticas públicas.

INTroDuCTIoN
 

The State Reform processes in the 1990s combined with 
the emergence and use of Information and Communication 
Technology (ICT) originated e-government policies and 
initiatives in Brazil. This paper assesses how the results 
of e-gov in the states of the federation are affected by the 
institutional design of e-gov policies.

The term e-gov refers normally to the use of ICT to 
provide services to the citizen, to the review and integra-
tion of processes, to improve the efficiency and efficacy of 
public administration, and to the creation of mechanisms 
of digital relations with the citizen. Although e-gov repre-
sents a scenario of possibilities for public management, a 
great part of theoretical and practical discussions on the 
benefits and potentialities of e-gov are based on a logic of 
will that keeps a certain technological imperative. What 
we notice as it is performed is that, in various situations, 
the effects on the use of ICT are complex and generate 
unpredictable results. Thus, we believe the study of the 
implementation of technology, including e-gov, should 
not restrict its technical components. For instance: one 
can seek understanding of institutional factors affecting 
technological management processes (as in this paper, for 
instance). The institutions give shape to the process of 
ICT use and end up catalyzing or moderating the imple-
mentation of e-gov. This premise guided the choice of 
institutionalism in its rational choice line, as a conceptual 
model for our investigation. The research question is: How 
is the institutionalization of Brazilian e-gov? Our aim is 
to understand the institutional design of e-gov and ICT 
in our state governments and how these arrangements 
affect the gains associated with e-gov.

To observe e-gov under an institutionalist scope has 
the potential of helping understand the institutional ar-
rangement e-gov assumed and the influence of this design 
in the use and results of e-gov initiatives. In the past few 
years, several studies examined innovation, development 
and implementation of ICT from an institutional perspec-
tive (MIGNERAT and RIVARD, 2005; FOUNTAIN, 2005; 
AVGEROU, 2000). Yet, in the context of ICT in govern-
ment, especially in the largest country in Latin America, 
these studies are in a very small number. We believe this 
is a contribution for that work, since approaches such 
as institutionalism, unusual in the field of Information 
Systems in Brazil, make it possible to create a solid frame-
work for the studies of governmental ICT policies. From 
an empirical point of view, this research contributed for 
that practice, pointing out the arrangements by means of 
which e-gov has been implemented in Brazilian states, 

clarifying the challenges for the creation of a state agenda. 
One of the most important consequences in the process of 
decentralization and democratization of political power 
in Brazil (from the 1980s) was the growth of the impor-
tance of subnational governments, be them state or city 
ones. However, academic literature on public management 
policies for state governments is still scarce (ABRUCIO, 
2004). This is another contribution we believe we are giv-
ing to conclude this research: a deep study on ICT usage 
policies in the state sphere.

STATE rEform AND THE uSE of ICT IN BrAZILIAN 
GoVErNmENTS

In the 1970s, mostly after the oil shock in 1973, the 
period Hobsbawm (1995) called “Fordist Golden Age” 
started showing signs of collapse. A crisis was beginning 
in three fundamental dimensions: economical, social and 
of the State apparatus.

Given the crisis context, the State Reform projects were 
prioritized. For public administration, some lines of action 
became compulsory, such as: expense reduction, State ap-
paratus efficiency increase, a need for greater agility and 
flexibility of the governmental apparatus to respond to 
external environment demands, more unstable and dy-
namic (BRASIL, 1995). Thatcher and Reagan governments 
represented a source of a new agenda internationally called 
“New Public Management” (NPM) which influenced the 
renovation movements in the 1990s in many countries.

 Abrucio (1997) traces some marks of development 
in the processes of State Reform. For that author, they 
started as pure managing. They focused on the most ur-
gent needs of changes in nations in the 1970s and 1980s 
– resources were scarce. Seeking to solve this, govern-
ments started adopting budget planning and cost control. 
A second tendency of State Reform movements, after 
managing, is consumerism. Attention was then focused 
on clients/consumers and included the administration 
patterns from private organizations applied to public 
ones. Despite their development, renovation movements 
started being criticized for their excessive inclusion of 
private administration in public administration agenda. 
As Mintzberg (1996) points out, citizens have rights 
that differ from the goods, products and services cli-
ents purchase. Therefore, certain British authors started 
discussing Public Service Orientation (PSO) aiming to 
introduce their accountability concepts – transparency, 
political participation, and equity (HEEKS, 1998) – in 
the State Reform agenda.

 The processes of State Reform are seen as a condition 
to enhance governance in public management, which 
is “the capacity of the State to efficiently and effectively 
transform the decisions they make into reality” (BRESSER 
PEREIRA, 1998, p. 109). Through governance, the State 
“seeks to deepen the democratic mechanisms of rendering 
the government responsible and transparent” (BRESSER 
PEREIRA, 1998, p. 109). Thus, the State Reform move-
ments brought up the discussion on the need for a more 
effective public administration based in solid governance 
principles, focused on the operational capacity of public 
administration and in the capacity of opening of the par-
ticipation channels for the citizens to elaborate, follow 
up and assess public policies. In practice, they prioritize 
public policies affecting areas such as planning, bud-
get, organizational structure, human resources, process 
management, governmental purchases, and information 
technologies (BARZELAY, 2001). According to Gaetani 
(2005), technically speaking, the use of technological in-
novations is an important factor for the modernization of 
public administration and e-gov can be understood as one 
of the most significant reforming initiatives of Brazilian 
public management.

 The genesis of ICT use in Brazilian public administra-
tion lays in the initiatives by state ICT companies since 
the 1960s and state computing councils since the 1970s. 
Those two structures, albeit named differently back then, 
remain up to the present. Throughout the 1980s and 
1990s, the states started adopting structures of comput-
ing planning and coordination. However, their initiatives 
were fragile, detached from the government’s plans and 
public policies (CHAHIN and others, 2004). In the 2000s, 
some states and cities tried new public computing orga-
nization models and developed projects for the improve-
ment in services provided for the citizen, using ICT and 
e-democracy, understood here as the use of ICT in ampli-
fying the practice of democracy and in the management of 
public policies. Specifically in public policies of govern-
mental management, Brazil faces great challenges, such 
as the labor relations in the ambit of public power; the 
definition of organizational architecture; the processes of 
budget planning and execution; the control mechanisms 
and the public expenses audit; and the rules for bidding 
and for hiring goods and services. In order to face these 
challenges, ICT has been used to support of people and 
competences management; to obtain information and 
indicators for making decisions; in the management of 
projects and goals; in the integration of planning systems; 
in the expenses follow-up; in the budget management; in 
the implementation of management information systems; 

and in systems allowing transparency of public expenses 
(GAETANI, 2005).

 Brazilian academic literature, in the past decade, in-
cludes researches on various aspects of e-gov or electronic 
governance, such as Akutsu and Pinho (2002); Ruediger 
(2002); Ramos and Ramos (2003); Frey (2003); Fernandes 
(2007); Knight, Fernandes and Cunha (2007); Pinho 
(2008); Diniz and others (2009); Cunha and Pozzebon 
(2009). There are researches related with ICT strategies 
and management models for the public sector, implemen-
tation of information systems, follow-up and assessment 
of public policies, social projects and programs, and digital 
inclusion, in addition to reports on specific aspects such 
as e-services and e-commerce.

The technological development has allowed the growth 
in electronic services, the opening of communication 
channels with society, and the disclosure of public admin-
istration initiatives. Despite the advances in ICT and the 
studies on e-gov in the context of Brazil, we believe it is 
important to dwell on institutional arrangements of e-gov 
and ICT, as the use of information technologies does not 
bring about the same effects in all contexts.

CoNCEPTuAL moDEL — E-GoV PoLICIES AND 
INSTITuTIoNALISm

 
A large part of the discussions and researches on e-gov 
and technology are based on an idea that the application 
of ICT and the organizational transformation keep cause 
and effect relations (AVGEROU, 2000). On this subject, 
Fountain (2005) highlights that, in such reports, ICT 
leads to a series or predictable changes and to greater 
organizational effectiveness. The idea that the initiatives 
of the agents are rational and maximize efficiency and ef-
ficacy is a commonly accepted assumption in researches 
on ICT (AVGEROU, 2000). Nevertheless, according to 
that author, such causality is not so simple to be observed 
and the studies on information technology need to focus 
on the institutional context where decisions are made. 
Thus, the neo-institutional analysis has the potential to 
help understand the means by which institutions influ-
ence the design, use and consequences of technology in 
organizations.

 Therefore, we built a conceptual model anchored in 
neo-institutionalism of rational choice aiming to study 
e-gov policies of the states in the Brazilian federation.

 Institutions can be understood as symbolic systems 
comprised of regulating, normative, and cultural/cognitive 
elements that produce stability and meaning in a given

social context as it determines the rules of the game to be 
observed by a group of actors. They are comprised of rules 
and norms that establish behavioral patterns of the actors 
and manipulate a series of sanctions – rewards and pun-
ishments – aiming to influence the agents’ behavior in a 
political game (HALL and TAYLOR, 1996; SCOTT, 2001).

 Scott (2001) offers and interesting analytical cut to 
facilitate the use of institutional theory in organizational 
analysis. In his view, institutionalist studies can be di-
vided in two foci: the first is based on regulating and 
normative aspects, following the rules of the game in an 
organizational context and enforcement mechanisms. 
It corresponds to the instrumental tradition of the new 
institutionalism represented by the economical lines and 
rational choice (HALL and TAYLOR, 1996). Theoreticians 
in this approach assume that individuals seek to know the 
rules of the political game so as to maximize their benefits 
and minimize their costs. In this case, institutions describe 
possible alternatives for the actors. They also provide en-
forcement mechanisms and information that reduce the 
uncertainty regarding the behaviors of others. The authors 
who adopt this approach assume that individuals seek 
to get to know the rules of the political game, from the 
permitted and forbidden movements to the penalties for 
those who infringe them, so as to maximize their payoffs.

 Scott (2001) mentions another group of institutional 
studies based on a cultural/cognitive or sociological line. 
They emphasize the extent to which the interpretation the 
actors give for a situation determines their choice. The 
conception of the institutions in this line points towards 
informal norms, habits, symbols and conventions that 
structure and shape up individuals’ behavior.

 According to Immergut (2006), neo-institutionalist 
analysis shows that preferences and decisions are prod-
ucts of the institutions and help analyze the reasons that 
lead the actors from a given context to choose a certain 
definition of interests and not another equally plausible 
one. For Goodin (1996), the institutions bring about the 
existence of designs or arrangements that promote a group 
of results. He states that institutional designs can be un-
derstood as the creation of an active format that causes 
results in a given context.

As previously mentioned, this paper uses the ap-
proach of rational choice to study e-gov policies designs 
in the states of the Brazilian federation. Thus, we study 
e-gov policies in an institution responsible for providing 
regulating and normative elements that will foment the 
creation of an institutional design capable of producing 
a group of e-gov results (OFFE, 1996). We state, then, 
that in an institutionalized e-gov policy, social structures 

and mechanisms were created determining the arrange-
ments of state e-gov and structuring ICT management. 
Therefore, it works as a strong government element guid-
ing the actors’ course of action. On the other hand, if it is 
fragile, it will be subdued by other institutions working 
on state governments.

Figure 1 presents a model we built to observe the in-
stitutional design of e-gov policies.

The arrangement is formed by the conjugation of 
the institutional context (1) and the technical one (2). 
According to Scott and Meyer (1991), these two should 
not exclude each other, as each one of them produces 
organizational responses based on rationality. To con-
sider the institutional context is important for Brazilian 
e-gov, as governments are inserted in an environment 
strongly marked by both formal and informal laws, rules 
and norms. Since the 1990s, there have been important 
attempts of administrative reforms in Brazil with new 
management tools. On the other hand, e-gov depends on 
ICT technical advances, which is marked by innovations, 
both in management associated with technology and in 
the technological development itself, as can be noted in 
the recent use of the web 2.0 tools.

 Returning to Figure 1, the conjunction of institutional 
(1) and technical (2) elements form the institutional de-
sign (3) of e-gov initiatives in Brazil. This design affects 
how technology is managed (4). The elements consid-
ered in the technology management part (4) were chosen 
from a view presented by Weill and Ross (2006) on ICT 
governance. The “technology management” component 
was described so as to observe: i) how states create gov-
ernance systems to manage e-gov with the definition of 
roles, duties and responsibilities of various agencies that 
comprise the public administration structure; ii) how they 
manage and prioritize ICT budget, which is important, 
as institutions influence how resources are allocated, de-
fining the “rules of the game” in this allocation (SCOTT 
and MEYER, 1991); iii) the data administration archi-
tecture corresponding to the mapping of databases, to 
standardization of data elements and data modeling in 
public administration; iv) the management of the ICT 
infrastructure; v) and the identification of the prioriti-
zation of the applications. E-gov initiatives demand the 
construction of applications used to provide services to 
the citizen. Institutionalized e-gov policies define patterns 
and procedures for the development of governmental ap-
plications, in addition to presenting software products as 
a result, allowing, for instance, an enhancement in the 
offer of governmental services.

 A fundamental element in Figure 1 is the understand-

ing of enforcement mechanisms generated by e-gov poli-
cies. An institution can only be considered as such from 
the moment when there are mechanisms to guarantee its 
imposition. The sanction character of an institution would 
only be unnecessary in an environment where rewards 
have such advantages that all parts would perform their 
pre-established roles. This is a rather unfeasible ideal con-
dition. Apart from enforcement, we have also considered 
in the design what Goodin (1996) pointed as a defining 
feature of the institutionalization process: its stable and 
recurrent nature. Institutions can be defined as a process 
by which organizations and procedures obtain value and 
stability. Therefore, e-gov policies need to be legitimized 
(3) in order to affect ICT management and e-gov results.

Finally, one will find e-gov results (6), which compre-
hend e-services, information transparency, effectiveness of 
governmental initiatives, and participation of citizens in the 
elaboration, follow-up and assessment of public policies. 
They also need enforcement mechanisms to come to exist.

In the following section we will discuss the develop-
ment of the study of e-gov policies institutionalization in 
state governments.

Our research perspective was inspired in texts and re-
searches by Walsham (1995), Pozzebon (2003) and 
Barbosa (2008). The epistemological position that guided 
this paper is interpretativist. It starts from the assumption 
that reality is socially construed by actors involved in it 
and, hence, it is impossible to completely separate facts 
from values, like in the positivist paradigm (WALSHAM, 
1995). The research issue – the object of analysis in this 
paper – is in the category called descriptive character re-
search. The research instruments or techniques that were 
used focused on a qualitative approach, since they seek 
to “describe, decode, translate and, on the other hand, 
to reach a conclusion regarding the meaning – not the 
frequency – of certain phenomena of the social world” 
(MAANEN, 1983). They are flexible and applied to small 
sample units. The central research approach is formed by 
the study of multiple cases.

 E-gov policies were studied in the realm of Brazilian 
state governments, which is justified by its relevance in 
the federative scenario of Brazil and also because e-gov

is still and agenda in process of assimilation in the 
policies of public state management (GAETANI, 2005; 
FERNANDES, 2007). The federation units chosen were 
the five states with the highest GDP in Brazil (IBGE, 
2006): São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Rio 
Grande do Sul, and Paraná. Pernambuco also joined the 
group, as its e-gov policy has been an object of studies 
and is referenced as a good model of e-gov development 
(FUNDAP, 2006). The choice of six states was arbitrary 
and sought relevance in the studied cases. Although 
the state of Rio de Janeiro agreed to participate in our 
research, we were unable to get an interview booked.

From the conceptual model (Figure 1), we estab-
lished the analysis categories. In the treatment of the 
data, the categorization strategy was important, as it 
allowed: (a) to group up elements, ideas and expres-
sions around concepts able to synthesize the collection, 
analysis and interpretation of the data; (b) to translate 
the theoretical framework in analyzable items; and (c) 
to allow the construction of tools to collect data in a 
form coherent with the theoretical framework we ad-
opted (MILES and HUBERMAN, 1994). The proposed 
categories were: ICT and e-gov legislation; ICT and e-
gov policies planning, formulation and integration; ICT 
organizational structure and arrangements: governance 
systems, roles, duties, responsibilities; ICT prioritiza-
tion and budget management; identification and pri-
oritization of applications; infrastructure management; 
Information Technology architecture; enforcement. 
In addition to these, we created categories regarding 
“results” which were the services offered; transpar-
ency; participation; and effectiveness in public policies 
management. The categories can be seen in Exhibit 1:

The semi-structured interview script contemplated 
analytical categories displayed in Exhibit 1, consisting 
of 14 questions. At first, people chosen to answer it 
were: i) a high management state representative, sec-
retary or undersecretary in coordination or planning 
areas; ii) the one responsible for e-gov state policies; 
iii) the president of the company or agency responsible 
for computing. After gathering the data, in December 
2009, 15 people had been interviewed in five states of 
the federation: 3 state secretaries, 2 state undersecre-
taries or joint secretaries, 4 state computing structure 
director-presidents (from the company or agency), 2 
other computing structure directors, 4 people respon-
sible for e-gov policies in the government. The inter-
views were recorded and transcribed.

The data analysis was made using the NVivo soft-
ware and it followed the model by Miles and Huberman 

(1994) in which the analysis is carried out in four 
phases: a) data collection; b) data reduction; c) data 
table or display; d) conclusion and checking. In the last 
phase, the researcher identifies regularities, patterns, 
explanations and flows of cause and effect.

 To perform the reduction and the data table, we 
used a coding model creating free nodes, tree nodes and 
case nodes from the texts of the interviews (BARBOSA, 
2008).

 Each free node crated received a code: [99]–[yyyy]–
[99]–[name of concept]. The first part [99] contained 
a question number from the script. The second [yyyy], 
an abbreviation of the analysis category; for instance, 
the code LEGINFO for ICT and e-gov legislation. 
The third part of the code [99] is the sequence of free 
nodes created in each category. The fourth part [name 
of concept] contained the name of the free node. This 
description allowed the researchers to quickly link the 
theoretical framework with the conceptual scheme dis-
played in Figure 1.

 Once the free nodes were created, the data were re-
duced by means of creating tree nodes. They result from 
the hierarchical aggregation of the free nodes (figure 2). 
With them, it is possible to establish more comprehen-
sive concepts, capable of facilitating the analysis. Based 
on the conceptual model, nine tree nodes were created: 
a) data architecture and administration; b) institutional 
context; c) governmental planning and formulation; d) 
e-gov policies institutionalization challenges; e) organi-
zational arrangements and structure; f) IT management; 
g) ICT management history; h) e-services providing; i) 
information access and transparency.

Finally, case nodes were created aiming to express 
relations among the tree nodes (BARBOSA, 2008). They 
were named from the conceptual model and from the 
authors’ experience in the subject of e-gov. There are 
three case nodes: 1) institutional context, formula-
tion and governmental planning; 2) IT management; 
3) results.

The case node (1) institutional context, formulation 
and governmental planning arose from the aggregation 
of tree nodes (b) institutional context; (c) formulation 
and governmental planning; (d) e-gov policies institu-
tionalization challenges; (g) ICT management history. 
The case node (2) IT management was composed of 
tree nodes (a) data administration and architecture; 
(3) organizational structure and arrangements; (f) IT 
management. At last, the case node (2) results was 
composed of the aggregation of the nodes (h) e-services

DATA ANALYSIS AND DISCuSSIoN
 

From the first interactions with the material, 202 
free nodes emerged from the interviews. They were 
reviewed, as there were duplicities and synonyms, 
resulting finally in 116 free nodes, made hierarchical 
in 9 tree nodes. After that, they were articulated into 
case nodes and used to organize the discussions in the 
following sections.

Institutional context, formulation and governmental 
planning
Exhibit 1 shows the first free nodes (12) organized in 
descending order of quantity of fragments from the inter-
views coded in each. In an interpretativist perspective, it 
is seemingly a contradiction to display the most frequent 
ones, as we aim to reach a concluding regarding meaning, 
not frequency, of certain phenomena of the social world 
(MAANEN, 1983). However, the meaning that emerged

from various interactions with the empirical material con-
firm the frequency, making us comfortable to display it.

The first highlighted point is that state government ICT 
policies do not prioritize integrated planning, as there is 
no state view as a whole (line 1, Exhibit 1). ICT plan-
ning in state governments ends up blended in a series of 
sectored policies given the inexistence of e-gov policies 
formal planning (lines 2 and 3, Exhibit 1). Other elements 
reinforce the reality of a gap in e-gov planning and of the 
existence of uncoordinated initiatives, most noticeably: 
(a) the inexistence of e-gov policy formalization – in-
cluding PPA (line 3, Exhibit 1); (b) Absence of ICT use 
institutionalization (line 10, Exhibit 1); and (c) ICT use 
based on the initiative of each secretarial or management 
sector (line 12).

For the interviewees there is no integrated view of ICT 
policies in those states. One of them states:

No, there is no central planning. I mean, then, there is 

no IT strategic planning. What’s there are a few practices, 

good ones, not bad, but sporadic and performed by iso-

lated individuals. A strategic IT guidance, for the state, 

for instance, what are all the great databases of the state? 

How can they be used? And so on. Throughout time, what 

works should be prioritized? This will be up to each de-

partment to propose to their system, their process, their 

project and to obtain this approval. (Interviewee #15, 

interview data.)

Another one states:

(...) what is chosen as priority, is so done by a certain 

agency or department. It is not prioritized for the govern-

ment or for the citizen, that is my view. If there’s money 

left, great. all can be done. If there’s no money left, each 

agency prioritizes itself. I think it’s hard, but it has to be 

at least minimally done (...). As people themselves aren’t 

committed to the state as a whole. They’re more commit-

ted to their organization, the area they run. It’s very hard 

to think state, very hard. (Interviewee # 13, interview 

data, our underlining).

The fragmentation of e-gov initiatives appears repetitively 
in the speech of interviewees. Even not focusing on the

given number (71), the pattern emerges in the analysis.
E-gov projects, in a perspective of maturity, require 

the use of ICT to interlink the systems, processes, orga-
nizational units and organizations, network integration, 
generalized convergence among agencies responsible for 
providing services (FERNANDES, 2007; ONU/ASPA, 
2008). Maturity is associated with the intensity with 
which e-gov projects and initiatives bring about public ad-
ministration structure and processes transformation. As a 
result, it depends on the government’s capacity of sustain-
ing a transforming process, which relies on the alignment 
among strategies and public administration structures 
and e-gov program (FERNANDES, 2007). Furthermore, 
the discussion of advanced patters of public management 
relies on the assumption that there is a cooperation logic 
among agencies and entities, so that there’s a more effec-
tive global effect in providing public service (ABRUCIO, 
1997). Thus, the insularity of ICT policies shows an 
institutional pattern that does not generate enforcement 
conditions capable of promoting the integration of public 
state administration agencies and entities.

In most cases, an isolated normative view prevails 
institutionally in each organization or government area 

performing ICT implementations in a broader, yet dis-
connected way of technological policy, favoring cohe-
sion in the use of ICT among governmental agencies. 
Integrating potencies tend to be neutralized by effective 
institutional arrangements, since the design in vigor fa-
vors the adoption of technology in a fragmented manner. 
There are no enforcement rules or mechanisms to run 
ICT initiatives harmoniously. It is a legitimate scenario 
for the actors to run ICT initiatives, since, although 
they highlight the need for integrated initiatives, there 
is nothing keeping e-gov initiatives to be run after an 
isolated fashion.

As indicated in line 3, Exhibit 1, there’s no e-gov or 
ICT policy. The common mentioning is the inexistence 
of strong policies. There are initiatives running in an 
isolated manner, but with no coordination or organicity. 
So “the lack of policies leads to unfinished initiatives. It’s 
just a collection of good intentions, isn’t it?” (Interviewee 
#11 – fragment from the interview.) In addition, the mere 
existence of a written policy doesn’t mean it is institu-
tionalized and is no guarantee that e-gov coordinated 
initiatives will be created. According to North (1990), 
individuals act in a social context seeking to understand

the rules of the game so as to avoid forbidden move-
ments and penalties. The aim is to maximize payoffs. 
The various agencies and entities adopt technology in 
a non-integrated manner and there are no constraints 
interposed between actors and the consecution of their 
preferences (HALL and TAYLOR, 2003). There is no 
cost, not even political, in the uncoordinated running 
of ICT initiatives.

The behavior of agencies and entities in ICT in state 
governments is an optimal response to the institutional 
context found. The tendency, therefore, is to give con-
tinuity to a scenario marked by fragmented initiatives, 
even if they present less-than-optimal collective results.

IT management
Regarding IT management, the nodes that emerged in 
the analysis point towards the difficulty of establishing 
criteria to guide the initiatives, indicated an incipient ICT 
management environment (Exhibit 3).

Notice that, in the chosen literature, ICT governance 
appears based on patterns that define mechanisms, for-
malizing relations and establishing rules and procedures 
to make sure that organizational aims are met (WEILL 
and ROSS, 2006). Exhibit 3 shows an environment of 
lack of formal processes to guide and direct the decisions 
regarding ICT, such as difficulties of establishing tech-
nical criteria for budget (line 5). Public administration 
agencies and entities have do not need to submit their 
technological initiatives to any sort of scrutiny and project 
selection to liberate resources. The aim of an investment 
approval process is associated with the capability of the 
investments in ICT to generate results towards the strat-
egy of the organization (WEILL and ROSS, 2006) or, in 
the case of governments, their government plans. Lines 
4, 7, 9 and 10 confirm the inexistence of methodologies 
for the management of projects, software requirements 
survey, ICT initiatives portfolio management and map-
ping, among others. This situation reveals that the insti-
tutional design in vigor is characterized by a low-standard 
governance technology.

States possess, at least, committees managing ICT (line 
2, Exhibit 3), descending from Computing Committees 
created in the 1970s. Despite that, various interviewees 
state that they are not operational and aggregate little ef-
fectiveness to ICT management. It is small in its ability 
to bring about a framework to guarantee or help state 
executives to make decisions.

There is now in legislation an IT committee aiming to as-

sess these demands, though, quite frankly, it’s not working 

here, it’s not operational. (Interviewee #1, fragment from 

interview, our underlining.)

That, like COSITE, it doesn’t work and never really 

worked. It worked badly in previous managements. As far 

as I know, it was never even instituted. (Interviewee #11, 

fragment from interview, our underlining.)

The committees are little operational arrangements and 
they aggregate marginal effectiveness to ICT manage-
ment. In addition to the lack of governance and the inef-
fectiveness of the committees, the other lines in Exhibit 
3 reinforce the idea of fragility in ICT management in 
state governments.

It is important to highlight that the levels of matu-
rity in ICT management among different departments 
in each state are different. The interviewees highlighted 
that there are agencies and departments with outstanding 
use of ICT such as the Treasury Department. One of the 
interviewees states:

The (...) State, by means of Professor (...) wanted to modern-

ize the whole collection process, the whole budget control 

process, both internal and external, and obtained internation-

al resources. At the time, nearly 60 million US dollars were 

applied in the reformulation, reorganization and moderniza-

tion of the Treasury. Then, there was a strong development. 

(Interviewee #12, fragment from the Interview.)

Other participants point out differentiated ICT struc-
tures in state treasuries. Most states have Departments 
of Treasury with their own data centers and ample 
structures with a large quantity of professionals and 
ICT processes. Regarding the other departments, State 
Treasuries perform a leading role in governmental tech-
nological innovation due to a series of factors. Among 
them: 1) the convincing and consequent support of the 
high administration regarding the strategic need for IT 
in operations; 2) the existence of incentive programs 
to the modernization of the financial administration 
of Brazilian states and cities financed by development 
agencies that help keep or increase IT investments, such 
as, for instant, the national program of fiscal administra-
tion support (PNAFE), financed by the Inter-American 
Development Bank (IDB); 3) greater base of knowledge 
and professionals enabled to use ICT intensively; 4) a 
longer use of computational tools, consequently more 
mature, since state treasuries were historically one of the 
first groups in state governments to be computerized due 
to the need to control expenses and revenues.

As the institutional context in vigor does not offer ar-
ticulated patterns for technology management, nor does 
it interpose constraints for the actors to use e-gov coor-
dinately, it is reasonable to infer that departments with 
higher degrees of development will continue to perform 
their investments and move away from those with incipi-
ent models.

Regarding the role of state computing organizations, 
the participants in this research mention they lack a clearer 
institutional mission:

There’s no clear definition: “Why would I want an IT com-

pany in the State? Do I want it or not? Is it better to live 

with or without it? And if I do want it, I need to demand 

something from it.” (Interviewee #3, fragment from the 

interview, our underlining.)

This scenario is consistent with the observations made by 
Fernandes (2007). One of the major institutional design 
challenges in e-gov policies is to define, with clarity, the 
acting model for computing companies in Federal, State 
and City ambits. He states that there is no clear perception 
in Brazil on the proper role for computing organizations. 
For him, “the definition of their role in alignment with 
an e-gov strategy is one of the most important items in 
the institutionalization of Brazilian e-gov.” (FERNANDES, 
2007, p. 502).

Another important element refers to the architecture 
and administration of state government data. Advanced 
levels of e-gov involve cooperation structures in various 
agencies and a persistent work in order to guarantee the 
interoperability of the applications (HEEKS, 1998; ONU/
ASPA, 2008). The key to integrate processes, in a techno-
logical perspective, goes through effective management 
of the data of the organization.

Exhibit 4 shows partially the case node IT Management 
in the items specifically related with Data Administration.

One of the interviewees affirms:

There’s none. That’s what we’re trying to set up now in 

this architecture. We’re trying to make this integration 

happen, this data administration more effective. Not even 

more effective – make it happen, because it’s just not there. 

(Interviewee #6, fragment from the interview.)

Data management is not completely absent, as there is 
management linked to each one of the systems, especially 
corporative ones that perform central functions such as 
budgets, finances, human resources, purchases, among 
others. Still, the management is vertical, restricted to the 
limit of each system and does not consider interconnec-
tions between processes. There are no patterns of interop-
erability. The capacity of ICT to offer quick and appro-
priate support to the reformulation of the processes and

activities in public administration, without management 
and/or standardization of the data, can be compromised.

Therefore, the situation of technology management 
reinforces an e-gov development model characterized by 
a frail strategic direction, uncoordinated arrangements, 
and absence of established mechanisms in ICT. The in-
stitutional design does not offer enforcement conditions 
for the harmonious use of ICT.

State secretarial technology areas notice that the rules 
of the game are not constructed aiming to promote coordi-
nation and integration of e-gov initiatives. To act without 
integration offers a less expensive option, since there is 
not need to deal with typical difficulties of articulation 
among departments. And since there are no enforcement 
conditions (lines 3 and 4; Exhibit 3), an institutional de-
sign in which non-integrated decisions are legitimized is 
outlined (MMERGUT, 2006).

Providing services, transparency and participation
Now, the field of results. It is a fact that the use of ICT to 
provide public services has become part of the state gov-
ernmental agenda. In the states, there are some leading 
agencies and entities in this initiative, such as the depart-
ments of treasury, traffic, education and commerce. Even 
when the services are not fully provided by digital means, 
we observed a concern in providing precise information to 
the citizens “if I am in the (...) state, regarding size, quan-
tity of services the government provides for the citizen, 
to inform well is quite a precious service” (Interviewee 
#14, fragment from interview).

There is growth in the ombudsman services provided. 
Some states establish criteria to make it possible to meet 
the demand for information and services directed to pub-

lic administration. The presence of ombudsmen indicates 
that state governments moved towards paying satisfaction 
on the demands that are directed to them.

On the other hand, interviews design a scenario of 
services with low interactivity, problems in providing 
services when they involve more than one governmental 
agency and the need to modernize the back-office so as to 
facilitate the computerization of processes and services. 
Providing e-services is, in may cases, emergent and with 
little development in transversal services, limiting to each 
agency’s initiatives.

The internet is used for the transparency of govern-
mental information in the issues required by law. The 
use of e-gov initiaves for social participation is small. 
Advanced e-gov levels, called e-governance by authors 
such as Ruediger (2002), are still little developed.

At the moment when the research was carried out, there 
are citizen participation initiatives in public policies us-
ing digital means: “That’s what they call democracy, isn’t 
it? I still think it’s rather inexpressive.” (Interviewee #13, 
fragment from the interview.)

Neither the integrated service providing nor the use of 
the internet as a mechanism of transparency and partici-
pation has reached it potential. These results corroborate 
those found in Pinho (2008), on Brazilian governmental 
portals with the appropriate technology, lower interactiv-
ity in services, absence of transparency excepting the items 
defined by law, and also the inexistence of participation 
mechanisms. The results show that the little integrated 
institutional arrangement of e-gov initiatives ends up 
damaging transversal digital services, to foment the ample 
exchange of information among public agencies and be-
tween them and society.

CoNCLuSIoN

The aim moving this research was to understand the insti-
tutional design of e-gov in states of the Brazilian federation 
and how it facilitates the gains associated with e-gov. For 
such, we dwelled on the regulatory and normative context, 
the government planning formulation, e-gov and ICT, ICT 
management and the obtained results.

Brazilian e-gov appeared in the early 2000s in the con-
text of State Reform movements, inheriting characteristics 
and utilization structure from ICTs in Brazilian public 
administration, with state computing organizations and 
committees similar to state computing councils. Some 
states and cities attempted certain changes and there was 
great availability of services to the population in the first 
decade of this century. New public management prac-
tices were and are being implemented in some Brazilian 
states, which require computing appropriateness. The 
Brazilian public sector is regulated, with formal financial 
and budget planning. The technological context is one of 
new technologies appearing and of new forms of using 
them, whose good example are the tools from Web 2.0 
and social networks that use it.

Retarding computing and e-gov planning, there are no 
areas responsible for ICT management with the power to 
coordinate computing efforts. ICT budget is managed by 
each department (government area). In each state, there 
is also ICT budget managed by a structuring project. 
There is no budget coordination or articulation, which 
replicates efforts, rework, unnecessary costs, in addition 
to nearly insurmountable integration challenges. ICT 
architecture is almost inexistent, excepting certain corpo-
rative systems. Infrastructure management is fragmented 
throughout the agencies, although there are IT structures 
(companies or agencies) that could perform this role. 
There is no coordinated identification or prioritization 
of applications. The current concern focus is seemingly 
circumscribed to the form the organization should take 
(mixed-economy company, agency, autarchy) and not 
what role this organization should perform. There are flex-
ibility and integration barriers that are hard to overcome 
if there is no concern with coordinated management and 
the establishment of standards for governmental data. IT 
management historical problems in the states, such as 
little alignment with governmental policies and with the 
needs of the departments, were not surmounted with the 
implementation of e-gov.

ICT policies in state government lack institutional-
ization. It is a challenge to establish solid guidelines for 
the initiatives in this area. E-gov is characterized by the 

fragmentation of initiatives and the difficulty in horizon-
tal coordination among various governmental agencies. 
E-gov policies in state governments are not strong enough 
to interpose constraints to the behavior of the actors. 
Each agency plans by itself, not managing ICT from the 
standards fro the state and there is no corporative data 
administration. If, at a given moment, this design favored 
the offer of services to the population by the more com-
puterized agencies and/or more entrepreneurs, such as the 
Department of Treasury and the Department of Traffic, 
now it interposes barriers to the offering of integrated 
and transactional processes in order to promote network 
integration.

The costs of “keeping it as it is” are smaller than those 
of facing the challenges of coordinating efforts. There are 
no enforcement mechanisms, nor financial ones, nor the 
loss of power or legitimacy, to make it disadvantageous 
for the actors to remain as they are. The results of e-gov 
policies are an offer of services that evolves within the 
scope of each department, but with great difficulties to 
offer integrated services, interdepartmental or even among 
different spheres of government or powers. There is no 
use of ICT in participation and transparency, excepting 
the areas defined by law (enforcement). The analysis on 
e-service providing, transparency and participation initia-
tives, and the effectiveness in public policies reveal that 
the current institutional design of state e-gov policies 
build barriers to its development. The institutional design 
limits the use of ICT, notably for not present regulating 
and normative elements capable of fomenting the imple-
mentation of e-gov focusing on the transformation of 
processes and the integration of initiatives in the various 
governmental agencies.

Regarding the agenda for the governments, we start 
from the observation that it is necessary to invest in e-gov, 
with no naive perceptions of a technological determin-
ism, and understanding that state e-gov institutional ar-
rangements, complex and with multiple actors, inherited 
historical characteristics from ICT use in Brazilian gov-
ernments and from the governmental context. Firstly, it is 
necessary to build ICT policies that leverage government 
strategies. Secondly, e-gov guidelines need to interpose 
obligations to the actors and enforcement conditions 
for public managers. Still, e-gov initiatives seem to lack 
leadership and require strategy to replace discourses and
