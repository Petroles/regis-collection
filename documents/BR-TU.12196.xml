Acidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae

Resumo  

Desde o século passado que, devido essencialmente à queima de combustíveis fósseis, 

agricultura e desflorestação, as concentrações de CO2 têm vindo a aumentar 

significativamente na atmosfera terrestre, levando a sérios impactes ambientais. Os 

níveis de CO2 atmosférico aumentaram de cerca de 280 ppM (partes por milhão) para 

cerca de 390 ppM em 2010 e prevê-se que continuem a subir, podendo atingir valores 

acima dos 1000 ppM em 2100. Como a atmosfera e os oceanos funcionam como 

sistemas interligados, as alterações que ocorrem num vão ter consequências no outro. 

Assim, com o aumento do CO2 na atmosfera, a pressão parcial do CO2 (?CO2) da água 

do mar também aumenta, o que, por sua vez, conduz a uma alteração química do 

carbonato, resultando na acidificação da água (redução do pH).  

Atualmente, o pH médio das águas dos oceanos é cerca de 8,2, uma décima abaixo dos 

valores pré-industriais. Tendo como base os cenários realistas para as futuras emissões 

de CO2, prevê-se que o pH possa diminuir ainda mais 0,3 - 0,4 unidades até 2100.   

Estas variações vão ter graves consequências ecológicas no planeta Terra, podendo 

causar uma perda global de biodiversidade, distúrbios nos processos dos ecossistemas 

e redução de bens e serviços ecológicos úteis ao Homem. Nos organismos marinhos, as 

consequências poderão ser drásticas, como por exemplo, diminuição das taxas de 

calcificação, alterações de processos fisiológicos e, também, variações no 

comportamento de alguns peixes. Uma vez que as fases iniciais de vida são mais 

vulneráveis às mudanças do ambiente, o mais provável é que os efeitos da acidificação 

sejam detetados mais facilmente nestes estágios do ciclo de vida. É portanto, 

fundamental compreender as consequências de um meio mais ácido em larvas e 

juvenis, que, por sua vez, se podem refletir nas populações adultas. 

A maioria dos peixes de recife são caracterizados por possuírem um ciclo de vida com 

duas fases: uma na qual o estágio larvar pelágico se desloca para águas abertas, longe 

do recife, e outra envolvendo o recrutamento para águas costeiras para assentar, 

vivendo aqui o resto da sua vida adulta. Outrora, pensava-se que a dispersão larvar era 

passiva e a localização do sítio de assentamento determinada totalmente pelas

correntes oceânicas. Hoje sabe-se que as larvas exibem natação ativa e orientada, 

podendo, deste modo, controlar a sua dispersão e assentamento.  

Para se orientarem no meio pelágico, as larvas, recorrem essencialmente a pistas 

olfativas e auditivas. Para além da orientação, os odores, são bastante úteis na deteção 

e evasão a predadores. No que diz respeito aos sons dos recifes, estes podem ser tanto 

de origem abiótica (movimento da água, rebentamento das ondas, chuva na superfície 

da água e eventos geológicos) como biótica (vários organismos como peixes e 

invertebrados), funcionando como uma pista bastante complexa. Estes sons podem 

variar com a hora do dia, provocando a deslocação larvar em direção aos recifes 

durante a noite, com o objectivo de assentamento. Durante o dia, as larvas afastam-se 

dos recifes, de modo a evitarem predadores associados a estes e para se alimentarem.  

Estudos recentes, onde foram utilizados peixes de recifes de coral, já demonstraram 

que o aumento do CO2 e a consequente diminuição do pH modificam negativamente o 

comportamento e as respostas sensoriais das fases iniciais de vida destes peixes, 

alterando as suas respostas a pistas olfativas, auditivas e até mesmo visuais. No 

entanto, pouco se sabe sobre a resposta de larvas de peixes temperados à acidificação 

do Oceano prevista para as próximas décadas. 

Assim, os objetivos deste estudo centraram-se na verificação das influências que os 

baixos níveis de pH podem ter no comportamento e nos sistemas sensoriais envolvidos 

na sobrevivência das populações larvares de peixes de recifes rochosos temperados. 

Mais especificamente, verificou-se se a acidificação afeta a resposta das larvas a pistas 

olfativas pertencentes a predadores prováveis de serem evitados aquando da procura 

de locais de assentamento e, também, a pistas auditivas utilizadas, possivelmente, na 

procura desses mesmos locais. Para esse efeito, larvas selvagens de peixe-rei (Atherina 

presbyter) e de caboz-da-areia (Pomatoschistus pictus) foram capturadas e expostas a 

dois tratamentos de pH, ~ 8,10 (tratamento controlo) e ~ 7,6 (tratamento acidificado). 

O tratamento controlo foi estabelecido através da difusão do ar envolvente na água 

dos aquários e o tratamento acidificado simulado através do bombeamento de CO2 na 

água, com o auxílio de um sistema de controladores de pH eletrónicos que 

mantiveram o pH ao nível desejado.

Posteriormente, as larvas de ambos os tratamentos, foram submetidas a experiências 

onde se utilizaram odores de potenciais predadores (experiência de odores) e sons 

diurnos dos recifes pertencentes à mesma localização de onde as larvas foram 

capturadas (experiência de sons). 

Para a realização das experiências de odores, foi utilizada uma câmara com dois canais 

de escolha que recebia água de duas fontes diferentes, tratadas com pistas olfativas 

diferentes. Aqui, as larvas eram capazes de nadar livremente e escolher qualquer um 

dos lados da câmara. No início de cada ensaio, uma larva foi colocada no centro da 

extremidade a jusante da câmara e, depois de 2 minutos de aclimatização, a posição 

da larva na câmara foi registada a cada 5 segundos, durante 2 minutos. O peixe-rei foi 

testado com pistas olfativas de robalo (Dicentrarchus labrax) e o caboz-da-areia com 

com pistas olfativas do blenideo Lipophrys trigloides. 

Nas experiências de sons, utilizou-se uma câmara de escolha auditiva, a qual consiste 

numa câmara tubular de acrílico inserida dentro de um aquário de vidro acusticamente 

isolado. Numa das extremidades da câmara havia uma coluna submersa que emitia os 

sons do recife e que foi trocada para o lado oposto, a meio de cada série de ensaios. 

No início de cada ensaio, uma larva foi libertada no centro da câmara e, após 1 minuto 

de aclimatização, a sua posição foi registada.  

As larvas de peixe-rei e de caboz-da-areia responderam de modo diferente aos testes 

olfactivos. Ao contrario do que se esperava, as larvas de peixe-rei criadas em condições 

controlo, não evitaram a pista odorífera do predador (robalo). Tal comportamento 

pode ter tido três causas diferentes: (1) as larvas de peixe-rei poderiam ainda ser naïve 

a qualquer pista produzida pelo robalo adulto, devido à ausência de contacto com este; 

(2) é possível que as larvas de peixe-rei sejam demasiado pequenas para pertencerem 

à alimentação do robalo adulto, não representando este, portanto, uma grande 

ameaça como predador; (3) a água do robalo veio de um aquário onde a água circula 

por uma sistema de tanques com outras espécies, podendo, assim, o odor do robalo 

estar diluído noutros odores. Quando as larvas de peixe-rei criadas em condições 

baixas de pH foram testadas, a resposta sensorial olfativa ao predador manteve-se 

semelhante.

Relativamente às larvas de caboz-da-areia, quando se testaram as que foram criadas 

em pH controlo, também não se verificou que tivessem evitado a pista olfativa do 

predador (L.-trigloides). Esta aparente ausência de resposta está, provavelmente, 

relacionada com o facto do L. trigloides não se alimentar de caboz-da-areia. Em 

contrapartida, a resposta comportamental, perante a pista odorífera do predador, das 

larvas criadas em condições acidificadas de pH, mudou significativamente, evitando, 

estas, fortemente o odor do L. trigloides (81% do tempo). Este comportamento pode 

representar uma deficiência sensorial, estando as larvas a responder a um odor ao 

qual não deveriam reagir, porque o L. trigloides não representa um perigo para o 

caboz-da-areia. Isto sugere que os baixos níveis de pH podem causar danos no 

mecanismo olfativo larvar, resultando num erro onde ocorre uma confusão na deteção 

de pistas olfativas importantes para a sobrevivência de larvas de algumas espécies de 

recife.  

Como foi observado nos testes olfativos, as duas espécies-alvo responderam de 

maneira diferente aos sons de recife emitidos. Contrariamente ao que se esperava, as 

larvas de peixe-rei criadas tanto no tratamento controlo, como no acidificado, não 

responderam aos sons de recife. Possivelmente, as suas larvas não necessitam de 

responder aos sons dos recifes, isto porque o peixe-rei tem um ciclo de vida particular, 

em que o adulto desova em águas costeiras e rasas e a larva eclode muito bem 

desenvolvida, permanecendo no mesmo sítio, em cardumes, para depois se afastar da 

costa, em adulto. Adicionalmente, esta é uma espécie de vida totalmente pelágica. 

Assim, o peixe-rei, não necessita de localizar um recife para se estabelecer. Outra 

possibilidade pode estar relacionada com o facto dos sons utilizados neste estudo 

estarem fora da sensibilidade auditiva deste peixe, o que não foi possível verificar 

devido à carência do aparelho apropriado para a realização do método Auditory 

Brainstem Response (ABR), uma técnica eletrofisiológica que permite definir limites de 

audição. 

As laravas de caboz-da-areia criadas em condições controlo evitaram fortemente os 

sons diurnos dos recifes. Tais resultados estão de acordo com estudos anteriormente 

realizados, onde foi demonstrado que, normalmente, durante o dia as larvas afastam-

se dos recifes a fim de evitarem os predadores do recife e se alimentarem e durante a 



Acidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae 

 

vi 
 

noite movem-se em direção ao recife para assentarem. Quando se testaram as larvas 

criadas em tratamento pH 7,6, o seu comportamento mudou significativamente. As 

larvas inverteram ou perderam as suas capacidades auditivas, não apresentando 

qualquer resposta aos sons. Estes resultados sugerem que níveis elevados de 

acidificação podem comprometer comportamentos auditivos fundamentais à 

sobrevivência destas larvas e que as respostas a pistas auditivas não irão compensar a 

potencial perda de outros sentidos, tais como o olfativo. 

A hipótese de adaptação dos peixes a um ambiente acidificado tem sido pouco 

estudada mas, não deve ser posta de lado. No entanto, é pouco provável que muitas 

das espécies marinhas possuam variações genéticas adaptadas a estas rápidas 

mudanças. Provavelmente, só as espécies com tempos de geração muito rápidos vão 

ser capazes de acompanhar o ritmo da mudança e adaptar-se. É importante que, de 

futuro, se façam experiências de longa duração (com várias gerações), isto porque 

pode ser que ocorra aclimatização e/ou adaptação. Com peixes, é mais difícil realizar 

este tipo de experiências, mas pode-se, pelo menos, fazer com a descendência de 

progenitores criados em ambiente acidificado, como já tem vindo a ser feito por 

outros investigadores.  

O presente estudo forneceu evidências de que acidificação do Oceano pode afetar 

significativamente as respostas sensoriais (olfativas e auditivas) de larvas de alguns 

peixes de recife temperado, causando impactes potencialmente negativos para a 

sobrevivência larvar e para reposição e sustentabilidade de populações. 

Este foi o primeiro estudo que verificou os efeitos resultantes do aumento das 

concentrações de CO2 nos oceanos no comportamento sensorial de peixes de recifes 

temperados, tendo sido um trabalho de grande importância nesta temática. Não 

obstante, é necessária mais investigação nesta área, tanto na realização do mesmo 

estudo em mais espécies (porque nem todas as espécies de larvas de peixes 

respondem da mesma forma às alterações do pH), como no aperfeiçoamento dos 

métodos experimentais, com o objetivo de compreender melhor as repercussões 

desta ameaça. Adicionalmente, uma vez que aumento global da temperatura irá atuar

Abstract 

Due to anthropogenic activity, atmospheric CO2 levels have been increasing since the 

last century. Consequently, the average levels of surface pH in the ocean is drastically 

dropping, affecting marine life, including changes in fish behaviour. In many coastal 

marine fish the selection of the adult habitat occurs in the pelagic larval phase, relying 

on hearing and olfaction for orientation as well as for predator avoidance and 

communication. In the present study, the effects of ocean acidification in the ability of 

fish larvae to detect olfactory cues from potential predators and auditory cues from 

adult habitats (reefs) were tested. Larvae of sand-smelt (Atherina presbyter) and 

painted goby (Pomatoschistus pictus) were reared in a control CO2 treatment (pH~8.10) 

and in a high CO2 treatment (pH~7.6). Later, fishes were subjected to odour 

experiments in a two channel choice flume and to sound experiments in an auditory 

choice chamber. Sand-smelt larvae reared in both control and acidified treatment did 

not show any response to olfactory cue and to reef sounds. Larval painted goby reared 

in high CO2 treatment and exposed to olfactory cue, strongly avoided the cue, what did 

not occur in larvae reared in control CO2 treatment. Regarding to sound tests, painted 

goby larvae from control treatment discriminated reef noises, as expected, however 

this behavior was absent in larvae reared in an acidified treatment. This study provid 

evidence that ocean acidification might affect the sensorial responses (olfactory and 

auditory) of larvae in some temperate reef fish, with potentially injurious impacts on 

their survival.

1. Introduction 

Over the last century, the concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other 

greenhouse gases, resultant mainly from combustion of fossil fuels, agriculture and 

deforestation, have been significantly increasing in Earth’s atmosphere, leading to 

serious environmental impacts (Raven et al., 2005; IPCC, 2007). Levels of atmospheric 

CO2 have steadily raised since pre-industrial times (about 265 years ago), from about 

280 ppm (parts per million) to nearly 390 ppm in 2010 (Solomon et al., 2007; Tans &amp;amp; 

Keeling, 2014) (figure 1).  It is expected that these levels will continue increasing at 

least until the next century, and unless emissions are substantially reduced, it can 

reach levels above 1000 ppm in 2100 (Raven et al., 2005). 

    

Figure 1 Keeling curve, variations in CO2 concentration (ppm) in Earth's atmosphere (Tans &amp;amp; Keeling, 

2014). 

 

Oceans have a fundamental role in the main processes that occur on Earth, and 

represent around 70% of its surface. They encompass a wide variety of habitats and 

ecosystems, contributing greatly to planet’s biodiversity and providing livelihood for 

humanity (Raven et al., 2005). The atmosphere and the oceans act as a linked systems, 

where changes that occur in one part of the system have consequences on the other 

(Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007). Thus, with the increasing of the atmospheric CO2 the 



Acidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae 

 

2 
 

partial pressure of CO2 (?CO2) in seawater also increases. When in contact with the 

oceans, CO2 is absorbed, leading to a chemical change of the carbonate of seawater 

(Gattuso &amp;amp; Buddemeier, 2000; Zeeb-Gladrow &amp;amp; Wolf, 2001). This causes ocean 

acidification (decrease in pH), which is occurring at a much faster rate than at any time 

in the past 650,000 years, representing a serious threat to marine ecosystems. In the 

atmosphere, CO2 is a chemically unreactive gas but, when dissolved in seawater, 

becomes more reactive getting involved on several chemical, physical and biological 

reactions (Raven et al., 2005). CO2 is dissolved in water and reacts with its molecules 

(H2O) forming carbonic acid (H2CO3):  

(1) [CO2] + [H2O] ? [H2CO3];  

Carbonic acid dissociates into H
+
 (hydrogen ion) and HCO3

- 
(bicarbonate ion):  

(2) [H2CO3] ? [H
+
] + [HCO3

-
];  

Due to the increase of H
+
, CO3

2- 
(carbonate ion) reacts with H

+
 forming HCO3

-
:  

(3) [H
+
] + [CO3

2-
] ? [HCO3

-
] 

Thus, the dissolution of CO2 in seawater leads to an increase in concentrations of H
+
 

(acidification), H2CO3 and HCO3
-
 and to a decrease of CO3

2-
 concentrations. This 

decrease in CO3
2-

 prevents the formation of carbonate minerals and promotes its 

dissolution, by influencing the equilibrium point of the following reaction:  

(4) CaCO3 ?   [Ca
2+

] + [CO3
2-

]; (CaCO3: Calcium carbonate).   

In summary, the rising level of CO2 in seawater increases the concentration of H2CO3, 

HCO3
-
 and H

+
 and decreases the concentration of CO3

2-
and pH (Raven et al., 2005) 

(figure 2).

It is estimated that nearly half of the additional CO2 produced by humans over the past 

250 years has been absorbed by the ocean. The actual seawater pH is on average 8.2, 

0.1 units lower than the pre-industrial values (Raven et al., 2005). Based on realistic 

scenarios for future emissions of CO2, it is expected that the oceanic pH may decrease 

even more 0.3 - 0.4 units by the year 2100 (Caldeira &amp;amp; Wickett, 2003) (figure 3), which 

would result in acidity values never reached in the last 400 000 years (Feely et al., 

2004). 

 

 

 

Figure 2 Diagram of CO2 cycle between the atmosphere and the ocean. Atmospheric carbon dioxide 

is absorbed by the ocean where it bonds with water generating carbonic acid. This acid then releases 

a bicarbonate ion and a hydrogen ion (increasing ocean acidification). Also, this hydrogen ion 

combines with free carbonate ion in the water, producing another bicarbonate ion. The free 

carbonate ion would otherwise be available to marine animals make calcium carbonate shells and 

skeletons. (Diagram adapted from Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007).

Figure 3 Atmospheric CO2 concentration and global average surface seawater pH projected under 

three scenarios: the “business-as-usual” IS92a CO2 emissions scenario (IS92a), the most (B1) and the 

least (A1F1) conservative SRES scenario (adapted from Meehl et al., 2007 in Fabry et al., 2008). 

 

It is expected that higher CO2 levels will result on serious impacts for Earth’s ecological 

systems, causing an overall loss of biodiversity, disruptions to ecosystems processes 

and a reduction in the ecological goods and services provided to human societies 

(Thomas et al., 2004; Lovejoy &amp;amp; Hannah, 2005). High CO2 levels can cause harmful 

effects in some calcifying marine organisms by decreasing the saturation of calcium 

carbonate and changing the calcification processes used on the production of shells, 

plates and skeletons (on corals and molluscs, for example) (Gattuso et al., 1999; 

Leclercq et al., 2000; Raven et al., 2005; Kleypas et al., 2006). Photosynthetic and non-

photosynthetic micro-organisms, the base of ocean food web, are other affected by 

ocean acidification (Riebesell et al., 2000; Huesemann et al, 2002; Feely et al., 2004; 

Raven et al., 2005). For juvenile and adult fish it is unlikely that the skeletal growth will 

be affected, since these life stages have precise control over their internal ionic 

environment (Munday et al., 2008). Yet, some variations can happen, such as 

variations on skeletal or otolith (fish ear bone) development during their embryonic or 

larval stages (Munday et al., 2008). In some species, physiological processes can also 

be affected due to a decrease in pH levels of cellular fluids (Feely et al., 2007).

Research in the field of ocean pH effects are becoming increasingly frequent. However, 

there is a major gap on such studies regarding marine fish and their behavior 

(Ishimatsu et al., 2008). In general, early life history stages are more vulnerable to 

changes in the surrounding environment, therefore, effects of acidification are most 

likely to be detected on this phase of the life cycle. It is critical to understand the 

consequences of an acidic environment in larval and juvenile survival, behavior and 

recruitment, which may have significant consequences in adult populations.  

 

Reef fish cycle 

The life cycle of fishes commonly includes four phases: embryo, larva, juvenile and 

adult. Some individuals manage to survive longer, reaching a fifth stage, the 

senescence phase (Fuiman, 2002).  

The majority of reef fish are characterized by having a pelagic, generally larval, stage 

resulting in a bipartite life cycle. These two phases (pelagic and benthic) vary in 

morphology, size, habitat, food and behavior (Leis, 1991). The spawning can be either 

broadcast or demersal, and is followed by the pelagic larval phase that recruit to 

nearshore waters. Here they metamorphose and, in the case of fish with demersal 

adult life, settle to spend the rest of their adult phase (Leis, 1991; Leis &amp;amp; McCormick, 

2002; Leis, 2006). Larvae may be subject to dispersal over long distances, from days to 

weeks (depending on the species), growing and developing in open waters (Fuiman, 

2002). In practice, a larva becomes juvenile when metamorphosis occurs and the 

external appearance of the individual changes (development of fins, sense organs, 

skeleton, external pigmentation, etc.). However, for many species with this bipartite 

life cycle, the settlement of larvae, where they become associated with a substrate 

(coral, rock, or bivalve reef or vegetation), is sometimes used as a synonym for 

metamorphosis (Fuiman, 2002).

Reef fish Larval Behaviour 

During the development of reef fish larvae before metamorphosis, when some 

morphological and physiological systems develop, two different stages can occur 

(drawing from invertebrate terminology; Cowen, 1991): a pre-competent stage, where 

larva undergoes a fast development and growth; and a competent stage, in which 

occurs a body maintenance and a reduced growth (Leis &amp;amp; McCormick, 2002). As reef 

fish larvae have to find a settlement site, the timing of metamorphosis is probably 

related not only to developmental stage, but also to better success in finding suitable 

settlement habitat (Leis, 2006).  

In the past, it has been assumed that pre-settlement stages of reef fishes were poor 

swimmers, not controlling their trajectories and passively drifting with currents. 

According to this view, all larvae behaved in the same way, regardless of species, 

ontogenetic stage or location (Leis, 2006). However, in the past 20 years, several 

studies seem to indicate the opposite. Studies in larval distribution have demonstrated 

that larvae of different species but originated from the same habitats show different 

distributions patterns (Reviews in Leis, 1991; Boehlert, 1996; Cowen &amp;amp; Sponaugle, 

1997). This could not happen if larvae were passive swimmers, otherwise species 

would all have equal distributions. There are also some evidences showing some 

degree of self-recruitment on populations. Larvae and juveniles are able to settle on 

their natal reefs, representing in some cases, locally spawned larvae, 60% of all recruits 

(Swearer et al., 1999; Jones et al., 1999, 2005; Taylor &amp;amp; Hellberg, 2003; Almany et al., 

2007; Planes et al., 2009). In addition, some species of perciform larvae, approaching 

settlement, show remarkable swimming abilities (Stobutzki &amp;amp; Bellwood, 1994, 1997; 

Leis et al., 1996; Leis &amp;amp; Carson-Ewart, 1997; Fisher et al., 2000; Fisher &amp;amp; Bellwood, 

2002), which allow them to control its dispersion and settlement. Thus, reef fish larvae 

can act as active particles (Stobutzki &amp;amp; Bellwood, 1997; Dudley et al., 2000; Fisher et al., 

2000; Leis &amp;amp; Carson-Ewart, 2003), having great skills of movement that can be even 

better than those of newly settled individuals (Stobutzki &amp;amp; Bellwood, 1994; Leis &amp;amp; 

Carson-Ewart, 1997; Stobutzki, 1998).  



Acidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae

Fish larvae also seem to show oriented swimming (Leis &amp;amp; Carson-Ewart, 1999, 2000, 

2003; Leis et al., 2006a, b, 2007) in response to reefs, from distances of at least 1 km 

(Leis et al., 1996; Stobutzki &amp;amp; Bellwood, 1998). There are indications that this 

orientation behavior differs between night and day, with larvae moving towards reefs 

at night to settle (Stobutzki &amp;amp; Bellwood, 1998) and offshore during the day to avoid 

reef-based predators and to feed (Leis &amp;amp; Carson-Ewart, 1998; Stobutzki &amp;amp; Bellwood, 

1998; Kingsford et al., 2002). However, it remains unclear what cues are used for 

dispersion and orientation in the pelagic environment. In nature, there are many cues 

used for orientation and navigation, which may contain visual, auditory, olfactory, 

magnetic, and kinetic information. A cue can be more or less valuable depending on 

the environment where it is propagated, on the utility of the information that it carries 

and on the ability that the receiver has to detect and interpret it. Consequently, 

multiple cues will work through different distances and with different degrees of 

accuracy, being used to solve spatial challenges, according to their hierarchies 

(Kingsford et al., 2002). For example, large migratory fish (salmon and tuna) use 

olfactory and magnetic cues and sun orientation for their orientated swimming in the 

open water (Ogden &amp;amp; Quinn, 1984). Juveniles and adult migratory fish of coral reefs 

use the compass orientation (although these cues are not very clear) (Ogden &amp;amp; Quinn, 

1984; Quinn &amp;amp; Ogden, 1984).  

Regarding fish larvae orientation abilities, little is known. However, some cues are 

suggested as being very useful for larvae on the selection of their settlement sites over 

long distances. During the orientation in the sea, vision can only be used over tens of 

meters, due to the attenuation of light in water. Since cues have to be detected from 

far, visual cues may be removed from this range, as well as the lateral line. However, 

for vertical distribution and settlement behavior, vision might be very useful (Myrberg 

&amp;amp; Fuiman, 2002; Kingsford et al., 2002).  

On the other hand, sound (Tolimieri et al., 2002; Simpson et al., 2004; Montgomery et 

al., 2006) and olfactory (Sweatman, 1988; Atema et al., 2002; Arvedlund &amp;amp; Takemura, 

2006; Gerlach et al., 2007) cues emanating from reefs are likely to be the most 

potentially cues used by pelagic reef fish larvae to recognize and locate a suitable and 



Acidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae

‘healthy’ reef to settle. However, it is still unclear what can be detected, at what 

development stages it can be identified and over what spatial scales orientation can 

operate (Leis, 2006). These two kinds of cues can carry information on the direction 

and the type of habitat from which they come from (Kingsford et al., 2002; 

Montgomery et al., 2006) acting over kilometer-scales.  

Larvae of many reef fishes have well-developed olfactory organs (Arvedlund et al., 

2007; Lara, 2008), supporting the hypothesis that they use olfactory signals to guide 

them toward to a settlement site. This assumption has been demonstrated in some 

studies. It was showed that fish larvae in a current, ignored downstream sites and had 

preference for upstream sites to settle (Elliott et al., 1995; Lecchini et al., 2005a). 

Settling larvae of some species could detect differences between the smell of their 

home reef and other reefs, preferring their home reef for settlement (Gerlach et al., 

2007). Apogonids larvae were able to distinguish and preferred olfactory cues from 

lagoon waters comparing with ocean waters (Atema et al., 2002). Finally, Elliott et al. 

(1995) showed that during settlement, juvenile anemonefishes (Amphiprion 

melanopus) use olfactory cues to detect and select the host anemones (also verified by 

Arvedlund et al., 1999 and Dixson et al., 2008). Settling larvae also responded to 

olfactory cues from resident conspecific adults (Sweatman, 1988; Døving et al., 2006). 

However, odours have a disadvantage as an orientation cue, as they are current-

dependent and diluted with distance from the source, being their components possibly 

degraded (Montgomery et al., 2001; Leis &amp;amp; McCormick, 2002). The olfactory cues thus 

act over small distances and can only be detected when larvae is near to odour source. 

These cues are normally involved in the avoidance of predators during the settlement 

process (Munday et al., 2009; Dixon et al., 2010). Although vision and 

mechanoreception are also used by larval reef fishes to identify and avoid predators 

(Chivers et al., 2001) olfaction is probably far more significant during the settlement 

stage, since normally larvae settle at night when visual predator cues detection is 

much lower (Dixon et al., 2010). Being this stage a period of an enormous predation 

risk (Caley et al., 1996; Almany &amp;amp; Webster, 2006), the capacity to recognize such cues 

is very important to ensure larval survival.

Underwater sound has a huge potential to act as an orientation cue. Sound travels fast 

(4.4 times faster in water than in air) over long distances (hundreds to thousands of 

meters) through water with low attenuation, being highly directional (Urick, 1983; 

Rogers &amp;amp; Cox, 1988; Richardson et al., 1995; Popper &amp;amp; Carlson, 1998) and current-

independent (because it is not dispersed by currents) (Armsworth, 2000). It can carry 

biological information about reefs (Myrberg, 1978; Hawkins &amp;amp; Myrberg, 1983; 

Stobutzki &amp;amp; Bellwood, 1998; Montgomery et al., 2001; Kingsford et al., 2002), varying 

the noise with the local fauna (Cato, 1980; McCauley &amp;amp; Cato, 2000; Radford et al., 

2008a, b). Auditory cues from reefs are a complex signal originated either from abiotic 

and/or biotic sources. Abiotic sounds can consist of physical processes acting along the 

reef such as the movement of water, geologic events, waves breaking on the coast and 

raindrops on the water surface (Popper &amp;amp; Hastings, 2009). Biotic sounds might be 

produced by several organisms such as fishes and invertebrates (snapping shrimp and 

urchins). These sounds can be produced with different purposes, such as 

communication over short and long distances with mates, offspring or conspecifics, or 

to catch prey (Popper &amp;amp; Hastings, 2009). Reef sounds may vary with time (season, 

moon phase and time of day) and the biological chorus has cyclical patterns in 

intensity, having a maximum during summer evenings around the new moon period 

(Cato, 1978; Radford et al., 2008b). 

Broadly speaking, the frequency hearing range of fishes lies between 30 and 1000 Hz, 

however there is great variation in hearing sensitivity among species. There are species 

with special adaptations that can detect sounds up to 3000 - 5000 Hz and other that 

are sensitive to infrasound or ultrasound (Slabbekoorn et al., 2010).  

Regarding to fish larvae it is somehow difficult to determine their auditory skills. In the 

past, it was believed that their hearing capabilities were quite limited (Myrberg &amp;amp; 

Fuiman, 2002). Nowadays, still little is known about what sounds (frequencies and 

intensities) larvae can hear and use, and over what scales (for navigation, for example), 

as well as the ontogenic development of these capabilities. The work of Egner &amp;amp; Mann 

(2005) and Simpson et al. (2005a) suggests that coral reef fish early embryonic stages 

can hear and that the response to noise probably changes with fishes’s ontogeny. 



Acidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae

Kenyon (1996) also shows that juveniles of two pomacentrid damselfish species, 

Stegastes partitus and Stegastes variabilis exhibited relatively poor auditory thresholds 

in comparison to conspecific adults. Apparently, larval fishes can hear between 100 

and 1000 Hz (Leis et al., 2011).  

Several field studies have demonstrated evidences that reef sounds are potentially 

useful cue for settlement stage larvae to locate a suitable settlement habitat (Tolimieri 

et al., 2000). By using light traps and underwater loudspeakers in order to determine 

whether fish larvae were attracted to sound emanating from reef, it was demonstrated 

for the first time that sound is a potential navigational cue in the aquatic environment. 

In this study the authors verified that temperate water triplefin larvae were more 

attracted to the light traps with underwater speakers broadcasting reef noise than to 

the silent light traps.  For some settlement-stages coral reef larvae it was likewise 

verified (Leis et al., 2003; Simpson et al., 2004). Also, by using patch reefs from dead 

coral rubble playing reef recordings, Simpson et al. (2005b) registered a higher natural 

settlement rate when compared to silent control patches. Further, some larvae are 

able of directional hearing, localizing a sound source (Tolimieri et al., 2004; Leis &amp;amp; 

Lockett, 2005)  and can differentiate between artificial (pure tones) and natural sounds 

(reef noises) (Leis et al., 2002). This response of coral reef fish larvae to auditory cues 

has been also physiologically demonstrated (Wright et al., 2005). 

 

Consequences for larvae in a future acidified ocean 

The increasing of CO2 and pH reduction in seawater have been found to adversely 

modify the behavior and sensory responses of early life history stages of reef fishes. 

Previous studies have found changes in larvae natural responses to odours and sounds. 

For example, Munday et al. (2009) reported that clownfish larvae (Amphiprion percula) 

reared in pH 7.8 became highly attracted to odours that avoided in ambient pH 

conditions (similar results observed by Dixson et al., 2010 and Munday et al., 2010) 

and larvae reared in pH 7.6 showed no response to those olfactory cues. The authors 

suggest that such disruptions were due to a damage in the transfer of chemosensory 

signals within the neurosensory system caused by the alteration of pH and ?CO2 (not

affecting this change the development of the external sensory apparatus of larvae). 

Munday et al. (2010) showed that larvae exposed to a high CO2 concentration had a 5-

9 fold higher mortality rates due to predation, with many individuals becoming 

attracted to the predator’s odour or losing the ability to sense it. The loss of aptitude 

to respond appropriately to odours when exposed to elevated CO2 conditions was also 

verified for pre-settlement damselfish (Pomacentrus amboinensis), as well as the 

inefficiency in their learning (Ferrari et al., 2012a). 

Regarding to the auditory response, other experiment showed that juvenile clownfish 

(Amphiprion percula) reared in ambient CO2 conditions avoided predator-rich daytime 

reef noises. In its turn juveniles reared in higher CO2 conditions were not able to 

respond appropriately to these sounds. (Simpson et al., 2011).  

Altogether, these results suggest that the ocean acidification, caused by the additional 

CO2 absorption by the ocean surface can have remarkable consequences on the 

recruitment success of adult populations, disturbing the functioning of marine 

ecosystems. 

It becomes to essential predict the effects of ocean acidification in different areas, 

including temperate zones, for instance the Portuguese coast. 

 

Objectives 

Despite the recent advances in the understanding of the impacts of ocean acidification 

on coral reef fish larvae, little is known on the response of temperate fish larvae to the 

increasing levels of CO2 expected in the coming decades. This study aims to provide 

essential data on the influence of those oceanic conditions on the behavior and 

sensory systems involved in the survival of larval populations of temperate reef fish, as 

well as their resilience. Specifically, the objectives of this study are: 

(1) Assess if CO2-induced seawater acidification scenarios affect the ability of 

temperate rocky reef fish larvae to respond to predator olfactory cues, likely to be 

avoided when searching for reefs and settlement sites;

(2) Assess if CO2-induced seawater acidification scenarios affect the ability of 

temperate rocky reef fish larvae to respond to auditory cues, likely to be used when 

searching for reefs and settlement sites;  

For this purpose, wild-caught larvae of sand-smelt (Atherina presbyter) and painted 

goby (Pomatoschistus pictus) were exposed to two pH levels, ~ 8.10 (control CO2 

treatment) and ~ 7.6 (high CO2 treatment).

2. Materials and methods 

2.1. Experimental species 

For this research, larvae of two species of teleost fishes were used, Atherina presbyter 

(Cuvier, 1829) and Pomatoschistus pictus (Malm, 1865). 

A. presbyter (sand-smelt) is a small pelagic fish species that inhabits coastal areas and 

estuaries, near surface. Its distribution ranges from the British Isles and southern 

North Sea to the Canary Islands, Mauritania and Cape Verde Islands (Quignard &amp;amp; Pras, 

1986), having also been reported in the Azores archipelago (Santos et al., 1997). It 

belongs to the Atherinidae family that is represented in the central-eastern and north-

eastern Atlantic by a single genus, Atherina, and three species (A. hepsetus, A. boyeri 

and A. presbyter) (Fischer et al., 1981; Quignard &amp;amp; Pras, 1986). A. presbyter is the 

commonest species of this family in the north-eastern Atlantic (Creech, 1990).  

This species reproduces in spring and summer (Billard, 1997), spawning inshore in very 

shallow waters (Bamber et al., 1985). Their large eggs are often associated with 

seaweed (Bracken &amp;amp; Kennedy, 1967; Bamber et al., 1985), and larvae hatch after 15-16 

days, with a total length of 6.7-7.5 mm (Bamber et al., 1985). Hatched larvae are well 

developed and remain inshore in shoals, amongst shelter, and near the water surface 

(Bamber et al., 1985). Larvae are active predators on visually selected animals in the 

water column (feeding strategy similar to adult), feeding mainly zooplankton (Bamber 

et al., 1985). These shoals include a range of ages (sizes) and can be found in shallow 

water near the shore on the coast or in rock pools (Holt, 1898, 1899; Ehrenbaum, 1905; 

Miller, 1962; Bracken &amp;amp; Kennedy, 1967; Palmer, 1979; Bamber et al., 1985), which 

allows them to escape predation by adult shoals (Bamber et al., 1985). The postlarval 

development (figure 4) is divided into 5 stages (related with swimbladder, 

melanophores, fins and scales development), until juvenile shows all the external 

characteristics of the adult fish (at their total length (TL) 23 - 24 mm) (Bamber et al., 

1985). When juvenile's fins are fully developed (when fish reaches ~18 mm TL), they 

tend to start moving away from the shallow waters edge to live their adult life 

(probably swimming becomes so efficient that replaces sheltering as an escape 

strategy) (Bamber et al., 1985).

specimen (Palmer &amp;amp; Culley, 1984). 

 

P. pictus (painted goby) is a small benthic-coastal fish species that preferably inhabits 

on shallow gravelly or sandy environment (1-55 m in depth) (Miller, 1986). Its 

distribution occurs along the east coast of the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean 

(Miller, 1986). It is one of the eleven species of Pomatoschistus genus in the Gobiidae 

family (Miller, 1986). This family comprises the greatest number of known fish species 

and are quite successful (Nelson, 1994).  

Its reproductive period depends on its geographic region, it may start in February or 

March and lasts until June or July (Miller, 1986). In Portugal, it goes at least from 

March to July (Pedro, 2006). During this period, male builds the nest under empty 

bivalve shells laying on sand (Miller, 1986). The protection of the nests that are used as 

spawning sites are ensured by males that also provide parental care of the eggs (Miller, 

1986). Larvae hatch with 2.7-3.0 mm of total length (Russel, 1976) after 11-12 days 

(Miller, 1986), developing in planktonic environment (Lebour, 1920). Its young can be 

found in tide pools (Miller, 1986). In Figure 5 it can be seen some stages of the 

postlarval development.

specimen(Petersen, 1919). 

 

These species were chosen because they are good model species to answer to 

behavioral ecology questions, as they are easily captured during the larval stage, easily 

reared in captivity, and abundant in the Portuguese coast. 

 

2.2. Collection of larvae  

Larvae of sand-smelt, Atherina presbyter, and painted goby, Pomatoschistus pictus, 

were collected in the very nearshore of Alpertuche beach (38° 28’ N; 8° 59’ W), located 

at the Arrábida Marine Park (Portugal), using a 1 mm mesh dip net, during the month 

of July 2013. Sand-smelt schools were mainly collected at the surface, while painted 

goby larvae were collected close to the bottom. 

Collected larvae were placed in a 30L bucket in ambient seawater, with gentle aeration 

and immediately transported to the laboratory. Larvae from each species were then 

transferred to separate 35 L aquariums, with fresh seawater, and left for one day to 

recover from transport and handling stress. Following this period, larvae were 

randomly assigned to a pH treatment, according to the experiment. Olfaction and 

hearing experiments were carried out at two pH levels, of ~ 8.10 (control CO2) and 



Acidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae 

 

16 
 

~.7.6 (high CO2). These pH values were both representative of the present-day pH 

conditions and the expectations for the future. 

Larvae were fed twice a day with Artemia sp. nauplii and a summer light cycle (14:10 h 

light : dark cycle) was simulated using fluorescent lights. 

The time (in days) that larvae of each experiment were exposed to the pH treatments 

prior to sensory tests is summarized in table 1. Due to logistical reasons, the minimum 

period of time that larvae were exposed to pH treatment was 2 days (sand-smelt of 

control CO2 treatment in hearing experiments). In comparison with the other periods 

may be considered short. However, it seems to be an acceptable period of time, since 

it is in the pH control treatment, in which there is no influence of pH decrease. In 

addition, similar periods have been used with larvae and juvenile fish in other studies 

(Tolimieri et al., 2004; Lecchini et al., 2005b).

2.3. Experimental set-up and seawater manipulations 

The experimental set-up consisted of 2 x 200 L recirculating seawater systems that 

were maintained at different conditions of pH and each supplied seawater to 6 

replicate 35-L aquariums. Each 200 L recirculating system was equipped with biological, 

mechanical, chemical and ultraviolet filtration. Temperature and salinity were kept 

constant during experiments (values shown in Table 2). The artificial seawater was 

obtained in the laboratory by blending a commercial salt mixture (Tropic Marin®) with 

filtered freshwater. To ensure the maintenance of the pH treatments where larvae 

were reared, CO2 was dosed to a set pHNBS. The control treatment was established by 

the diffusion of ambient air in the seawater. The acidification condition was simulated 

by pumping the seawater with CO2, through a system of an electronic pH-controllers 

(Tunze Aquarientechnik, Germany) that maintained pH at the desired level. The pH 

controller was attached to a sump. Rearing tanks were sealed on top with a clear glass 

lid to limit CO2 exchange with the atmosphere. Temperature, salinity and pH of each 

aquarium were independently validated twice daily, using a portable meter (SevenGo 

DuoPro, SG23) calibrated weekly with fresh buffers (Mettler Toledo). pH was 

measured on the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) scale. Oxygen levels were 

maintained above 90% saturation by the mixing action of the diffusion pumps in the 

sumps. 

Samples for total alkalinity (TA) determinations were collected once a week, from each 

treatment, placed in air-tight containers without air space, stabilized by mercuric 

chloride poisoning (Dickson et al., 2007) and kept at +4°C until further analysis. 

Analysis of TA were performed using the spectrophotometric method described by 

Sarazin et al. (1999). Average seawater ?CO2 was calculated using these parameters in 

CO2SYS, with the constants of Mehrbach et al. (1973) refit by Dickson &amp;amp; Millero (1987). 

Estimated seawater parameters are shown in Table 2. 

Biological activity in the recirculating system and occasional water exchanges caused 

fluctuations in pH and total alkalinity of seawater during the experiment.

Table 2 Summary of mean seawater parameters in control and acidified treatments. 

 

Although pH values were within an expected range, ?CO2 values were higher both in 

control and high treatments than expected, indicating that a higher amount of CO2 was 

required to acidify water in this experiment. The use of a commercial salt mixture is 

most likely responsible for these values. Nevertheless, these values were 

representative of the present-day conditions in many coastal areas (corresponding to 

~400 µatm atmospheric ?CO2; Solomon et al., 2007; Keeling et al., 2009) and of what 

was predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change for the year 2300 

(~2000 µatm ?CO2; Caldeira &amp;amp; Wickett, 2005; IPCC 2007). Total alkalinity of Tropic 

Marin® seawater was slightly higher in all treatments than values reported from the 

natural seawater (~2300-2500 µmol kg
–1

 seawater) (Zeebe &amp;amp; Wolf-Gladrow, 2001; 

Riebesell et al., 2010), as is typical for artificial sea salt formulations. Thus, the 

estimates of the effects of ocean acidification obtained in the present study need to 

take this in consideration, as the CO2-induced changes in pH and carbonate chemistry 

might be stronger in the natural seawater with lower alkalinity.

2.4.1. Olfactory cues 

To test the response (preference or avoidance) of larvae reared on different pH 

treatments to olfactory cues, a two channel choice flume was used (figure 6), adapted 

from Gerlach et al. (2007). Larvae were able to freely swim to either side of the 

chamber. Water from two different sources, treated with different olfactory cues, 

flowed through plastic tubes to the chamber (see figure 6). The flume allows a laminar 

flow separation of the two water sources. A constant gravity-driven flow of 100 mL 

min
-1

 per channel, which was measured with a flow meter, was maintained throughout 

all experiment. To ensure that the flow was separate and parallel in the two channels,

with no turbulence or eddies, dye tests were performed before the experiments. At 

the beginning of each trial, a single larva was released into the center of the 

downstream end of the chamber. After 2 min of acclimation to the two water choices, 

the position of larva on each side of the chamber was recorded every 5 sec, over 2 min. 

This procedure was followed by 1 min of rest, during which the water sources were 

switched in order to outwit any side preference that was not related with the water 

source. After this minute, the entire test was repeated, including the 2 min acclimation 

period. 

  

Figure 6 Two channel choice flume (design adapted from Gerlach et al., 2007). 

 

In each trial, a larva was given a choice in the flume chamber between a water source 

treated with a specific olfactory cue and an identical water source without that cue. 

Artificial seawater was used in the olfactory tests because it was assumed to contain 

no biological cues that the larvae may have become accustomed to during rearing.  

 

Specific olfactory tests included: 

(1) Untreated seawater compared with untreated seawater (blank1 vs. blank2), this 

was used as a blank control;  

(2) Seawater treated with the olfactory cue produced by predators compared with 

untreated seawater. 

 

To test the response of larvae to olfactory cues from a predator, water from a tank of 

adult sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax, was used to test Atherina presbyter larvae. Sea

bass was chosen as it is known to prey on small pelagic fishes, such as atherinids (Spitz 

et al., 2013). For logistical reasons, the same odour source could not be used to test 

olfactory discrimination of Pomatoschistus pictus. For this species, water from a tank 

of adult blenny Lipophrys trigloides was used. As the natural range of concentrations of 

specific olfactory cues in the environment is unknown, this protocol was designed 

simply to test for a reaction to the odor at an arbitrary concentration.  

This protocol was performed for the two pH treatments, control CO2 (8.1) and high CO2 

(7.6). 

After the test, fish were killed with the anaesthetic MS222 and fixed in 96% ethanol. 

Larvae were latter photographed under a dissecting microscope for further 

measurements. 

 

2.4.2. Statistical analyses 

Due to the high variance and non-normal distribution of most data, it was not possible 

to use parametric statistics. Instead non-parametric statistical tests were used. 

To test an effect of time in treatment in the response of larvae to cues, the 

Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used. When no differences were found, data were 

treated together. 

To determine if larvae exhibited a preference or avoidance for the tested cue, the 

mean proportion of time spent in the stream of water containing the predator cue (or, 

in blank1 vs. blank2, the designated) was compared against the null expectation of 0.5 

for no preference using the one-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test. 

The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was again used to verify if the response of larvae was 

similar in the presence and absence (control situation) of the predator cue, as well as 

to compare the larvae response to that cue when reared in different pH levels. 

For all tests, the significance level was ?=0.05.

2.5. Sound experiment 

? Details of daytime reef recording 

The daytime reef recording was conducted at the Arrábida Marine Park, at the very 

nearshore, and a depth of 8 meters (25/05/2013, 1245 hrs.), under calm conditions. 

These diurnal sounds were taken with an omnidirectional hydrophone (HiTech HTI-96-

MIN with inbuilt preamplifier, High Tech Inc., Gulfport MS) connected to a digital Sony 

PCM-M10 recorder (96 kHz 24-bit Recording). The recording had a total of 2 min. Later, 

the recording acoustic data was analyzed using the software Avisoft SASLab Pro 

(Avisoft Bioacoustics, Berlin, Germany) to obtain the spectral level (see figure 7). The 

total sound intensity [rms (rootmeansquare) expressed as dB re 1 µPa] of this 

recording was 122.6 dB re 1 µPa. 

     

 

Figure 7 Spectral level analysis of the recorded sound used on this experiment. 

 

The sound from the daytime reef recording seems to have quite activity according to 

its range of frequencies and intensities. This activity can be caused by distant shipping 

industrial or sismic-survey noise, wind and wave noise, and biological noise (the three 

primary sources in most shallow waters regions) (Greene, 1995). The noise of wind and 

waves produces frequencies between 10 and 1000 Hz, whereas biological noises can 

cover a very wide range of frequencies (Knudsen et al. 1948; Wenz 1962).

? The auditory choice chamber 

The response to the reef sound was tested in an auditory choice chamber (figure 8), 

adapted from Simpson et al. (2011). The auditory choice chamber consisted of an 

acrylic tubular chamber inside a glass aquarium coated with polystyrene foam. Both 

ends of the tubular chamber were covered with cotton fabric (acoustically transparent 

ends). At one of the ends it was placed an underwater speaker, which was moved to 

the opposite side of the aquarium in the middle of every series of tests, in order to 

outwit any side preference that was not related with the sound source. The 

underwater speaker broadcasted the desired sound towards the chamber. At the 

center of this chamber there was an observation window where larvae were released 

– the larva release chamber.

In order to reduce the low frequency ambient background noise in the auditory choice 

chamber and influence of the building’s vibrations, the following adaptations were 

made: 

- The choice aquarium was coated with polystyrene foam and laying in layers of 

rockwool and roofmate, on the top of a table; 

- Each leg of the table was placed inside a vase with sand and rockwool, in order to 

avoid direct contact of the table with the floor.  

 

? Adjust of the broadcast sound level in the auditory choice chamber 

The recorded sounds were played back in the auditory choice chamber using a sound 

system that consisted of a Mp3 player, an amplifier module and an underwater 

speaker (Electrovoice UW-30, Lubell Labs Inc., Columbus, OH, USA). 

Initially it was intended to use a similar intensity to that recorded in the rocky reef 

during the recording of sounds (similar overall spectral composition) but due to 

technical difficulties this was not possible. Thus, the criteria used for choosing the 

sound level was to have a louder sound than the background noise and the existence 

of a gradient of sound inside the auditory chamber, to assure larvae could choose 

which way to go, avoiding or going in the direction of sound. The original recording of 

the reef sounds was played back inside the chamber, and with the aid of the 

hydrophone, the emitted sound was recorded during 2 min at the near end (near the 

speaker) and at the far end of the chamber (opposite side of the speaker). This 

procedure was performed until the existence of a gradient of sound along the chamber 

was verified, using the Avisoft SASLab Pro to analyze the sound. The spectral level 

characteristics of the broadcast sound at the beginning and at the end of the tubular 

chamber can be seen in figure 9, which also shows the gradient.  



Acidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae 

 

24 
 

 

Figure 9 Spectral level analysis of the broadcast sound at the beginning and at the end of the 

tubular chamber. It can be seen that the sound level is higher at the speaker side than at the 

opposite speaker side. 

 

In order to analyze the ambient background sound existing in the experimental 

laboratory, silence recordings (no replayed sound) were also made. It was then verified 

that the ambient background noise would not affect much this study, since the 

broadcast noise levels were higher than the ambient background noise.  

It was not possible to verify if the sound intensity was within the hearing thresholds of 

the tested species, since we did not have the necessary equipment to investigate this. 

To determine thresholds of hearing, one would have to proceed an 

electrophysiological technique, the Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR), as described 

in Kenyon et al. (1998) and Simpson et al. (2011). The ABR measures in the eighth 

cranial nerve and brainstem auditory nuceli, the electrical potential produced in 

response to sound. This is considered to be the ideal method to use in the hearing 

abilities of settlement-stages fish larvae research, since it allows a quick measurement 

of the auditory capacity (Higgs et al., 2002). 

 

2.5.1. Auditory cues 

To perform the acoustic experiment, the method used by Simpson et al. (2011) was 

adapted. At the beginning of each trial, one larva was placed in the release chamber, in 



Acidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae 

 

25 
 

the middle of the auditory choice chamber. After 1 min of acclimation, the reef sounds 

were played (2 min recording in loop), and after 1 min, the larva was released in the 

tubular chamber, and its position recorded every 5 sec, over 2 min. The position of the 

larva could either be “speaker side” or “opposite speaker side” - the tubular chamber 

was divided with an imaginary line, and the area under larval release chamber was 

considered as opposite speaker side (see Figure 8.). Between each series of trials, the 

underwater speaker was switched to the opposite end of the auditory choice chamber. 

In addition, the tubular chamber was constantly flushed to avoid any olfactory gradient 

which could influence larva’s choice and frequently renewed to maintain its 

temperature constant. 

The entire procedure described above was also performed in silence (no replayed 

sound), in order to test the potential for extraneous cues which could bias directional 

swimming behavior of larvae. 

This protocol was performed for the two pH treatments, control CO2 (8.1) and high CO2 

(7.6). 

After the test, fish were killed with the anaesthetic MS222 and fixed in 96% ethanol. 

Larvae were latter photographed under a dissecting microscope for further 

measurements. 

 

2.5.2. Statistical analysis 

Because of the high variance and the non-normal distribution of data, it was not 

possible to use parametric statistics. Instead, non-parametric statistical tests were 

used. 

To test an effect of time in treatment in the response of larvae to cues, the 

Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used. When no differences were found, data were 

treated together.  

To determine if larvae exhibited a preference or avoidance for a side of the auditory 

choice chamber the mean proportion of time spent in the opposite side was compared

26 
 

against the null expectation of 0.5 for no preference using the one-sample Wilcoxon 

signed rank test. This test was performed for both silence and sound experiments. 

The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was again used to verify if the response of larvae was 

similar with the reef sounds and with silence (control situation), and to test the effect 

of CO2 treatment on the response of larvae between treatment groups. 

For all tests, the significance level was ?=0.05.

3. Results 

3.1. Olfactory cues  

Regarding A. presbyter larvae response to predator cues, no statistically significant 

differences were found after spending 12 and 18 days in each pH treatments 

(Kolmogorov-Smirnov test: p&gt;0.10). Thus, data were grouped per treatment. 

In the control test, where neither stream of seawater in the flume contained an 

olfactory cue, larvae of both pH treatments showed random movement, spending 

approximately equal amounts of time on each side of the chamber (figure 10). Larvae 

reared in control CO2 treatment (8.1) did not show any response in the presence of 

olfactory predator cue (One-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test, n=23, p&gt;0.60). Larvae 

reared in high CO2 treatment (7.6) showed a slight preference for the predator cue, 

spending 63% of their time in that stream of water (One-sample Wilcoxon signed rank 

test, n=23, p&lt;0.05), but this apparent preference was not statistically significant. Lastly, 

larvae did not exhibit any significant differences in their behavior response to predator, 

when comparing between the pH treatments where they were reared (Kolmogorov-

Smirnov test: p&gt;0.10).

and the other stream did not (blank). The sample size of each test is given on bars.

For P. pictus larvae, no statistically significant differences were also found in the 

response to predator cues after spending 7 and 21 days in low pH treatments 

(Kolmogorov-Smirnov test: p&gt;0.10). Consequently, data were grouped for this 

treatment. 

Larvae of this species showed a similar response as A. presbyter when tested in the 

control situation (blank 1 vs. blank 2), spending approximately equal amounts of time 

on each side of the chamber (figure 11). However, when larvae reared in high CO2 

treatment were exposed to olfactory  cue, there was a strong avoidance for this cue 

(One-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test, n=17, p&lt;0.001) that did not occur in larvae 

reared in control CO2 treatment (One-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test, n=8, p&gt;0.60). 

A significant effect of CO2 treatment was detected, with the response of the high CO2 

treatment being significantly different from the control treatment (Kolmogorov-

Smirnov test, p&lt;0.005).

3.2. Auditory cues 

Regarding control tests, during silent experiments, when neither side of the auditory 

choice chamber had replayed sound, A. presbyter larvae reared in both pH 

treatements showed no significant preferences for a side of the chamber (control CO2: 

One-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test, n=13, p&gt;0.60; high CO2: One-sample Wilcoxon 

signed rank test, n=15, p&gt;0.30), with larvae spending between 41 to 54 % at the 

opposite speaker side of the chamber (figure 12). When presented with reef sounds, 

larvae also showed no preference or avoidance for playback sounds, spending 

approximately equal amounts of time in the in the speaker side of the chamber, that 

contained the auditory cue and in the opposite speaker side (control CO2: One-sample 

Wilcoxon signed rank test, n=15, p&gt;0.30; high CO2: One-sample Wilcoxon signed rank 

test, n=15, p&gt;0.20). Overall, there were no significant differences in the behavior of 

larvae reared in the different pH treatments (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p&gt;0.10).

For P. pictus larvae, there were no statistically significant differences in the response to 

the reef noises after spending 16 and 36 days in control CO2 treatment, and 7 and 14

days in high CO2 treatment  (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p&gt;0.10). Consequently, data 

were grouped per treatment. 

Larvae from control CO2-conditions significantly avoided the daytime reef recordings 

(One-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test, n=30, p&lt;0.004), spending, on average, 73% 

per cent of the time in the half of the chamber away from the speaker (figure 13). By 

contrast, no avoidance behaviour was detected in larvae reared in CO2-enriched 

conditions (One-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test, n=27, p&gt;0.80).  

A significant effect of CO2 treatment was detected, with the response of the high CO2 

treatment being significantly different from the control treatment (Kolmogorov-

Smirnov test, p&lt;0.03). No deviation from random movement was observed in the trials 

without playback sound: mean percentage of time spent by each group towards the 

speaker ranged from 46 to 55 % (One-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test, n=15, p&gt;0.50 

throughout).

Acidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae

4. Discussion   

Recent studies on tropical reef fishes have already showed that low pH values (i.e. high 

?CO2 levels) affect sensorial behavior in early life stages of these fishes, by modifying 

their responses to olfactory (Munday et al., 2009, 2010; Dixson et al., 2010; Ferrari et 

al., 2012a), auditory (Simpson et al., 2011) and even visual cues (Ferrari et al., 2012b; 

Chung et al., 2014). The present study, suggest that such pH conditions might also 

significantly affect the sensorial responses (to olfactory and auditory cues) of larvae in 

some temperate reef fishes. Such behavioral impairment in reef larvae may have 

remarkable consequences in population replenishment and sustainability (Munday et 

al., 2010). 

 

4.1. Olfactory cues  

Sand-smelt and painted goby larvae responded differently to the tested olfactory cues. 

Opposite to what was expected, sand-smelt larvae reared in control conditions did not 

avoid the predator cue when sea bass odours were presented in the choice flume. This 

lack of anti-predator response was surprising since sea bass is known to be a predator 

of this species. There might be three possible hypotheses for these results. It is known 

that learning has an important role in the development of anti-predator response of 

many fish (Kieffer &amp;amp; Colgan, 1992; Kelley &amp;amp; Magurran, 2003; Ferrari et al., 2010) and it 

may provide a mean by which naïve prey will recognize a novel predator and react 

appropriately to this threat (Brown, 2003), increasing the chances of individuals to 

survive an encounter. This knowledge can be achieve by pairing alarm cues [olfactory 

cue released from the damaged epidermis of a prey that was attacked or captured by a 

predator, providing thus a reliable indicator of predation threat to conspecifics and 

some heterospecifics (Chivers &amp;amp; Smith, 1998)] with a predator cue (visual, odour or 

sound) (Smith, 1999; Suboski, 1990; Ferrari et al, 2010; Larson &amp;amp; McCormick, 2005; 

Holmes &amp;amp; McCormick, 2010). Perhaps sand-smelt larvae were still naïve to any cue 

produced by adult sea bass due to the absence of contact with it. The behavioural 

response to predation risk might have great energetic costs, which commonly involves 



Acidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae 

 

32 
 

reducing the amount of time spent on other fitness-promoting activities such as 

foraging and growth (Sih, 1980;?Milinski, 1993; Sogard, 1997; Fievet et al., 2008). It is 

thus an advantage that larvae have the flexibility to discriminate between different 

degrees of predation threat, in order to decrease the costs of reacting to a false alarm 

[threat-sensitive predator avoidance hypothesis suggested by Helfman (1989), “which 

predicts that prey individuals will trade-off predator avoidance against other activities 

by altering their avoidance responses in a manner that reflects the magnitude of the 

predatory threat”]. 

Another possibility is related to the fact that prey response, or absence of it, to 

potential predators odours may vary, among others, depending on a predator’s body 

size (Helfamn, 1989; Kusch et al., 2004). Perhaps sand-smelt larvae are too small and 

do not enter in the size selection ranges of the adult sea bass, and therefore do not 

represent a major predator threat. As far as it is known, the larval stages do not belong 

to the feeding preferences of the adult sea bass (Spitz et al., 2013). 

The other hypothesis for the apparent lack of anti-predator response by sand-smelt 

larvae reared in control conditions might be related to the intensity of predator odours. 

Water from a sea bass tank was collected at a public aquarium (Aquário Vasco da 

Gama), where water circulates through a network of tanks replenished with other 

species.  The sea bass odours, might therefore, be diluted in other odors. In the future, 

a more appropriate procedure to obtain a most reliable predator's odor would be as 

follows (adapted from Holmes &amp;amp; McCormick, 2010): place the predators into 

acclimation aquariums for 36 h, such that all fecal matter passes through the system 

and prevent contamination of the final cue. After this, place individual fish into 

separate aquariums with fresh seawater and constant aeration for four days, without 

changing the water or feeding the fish (to prevent fecal matter from contaminating the 

final odour). Then draw the water from the aquarium and freeze it in portions until 

needed in the experiments.   

When sand-smelt larvae reared in low pH conditions were tested, there was a slight 

change in the chemosensory response to the predator, with larvae spending 

approximately 63% of the time in the predator cue. However, this preference was not 



Acidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae 

 

33 
 

significantly different from larvae reared in control conditions. In order to clarify this 

result it is suggested carry out the experiment with a greater N. 

Regarding painted goby larvae, there was not also an avoiding behavior of larvae 

reared in control pH in presence of L. trigloides odor cue. This apparent lack of 

response might be related to the fact that this blenny feeds on mussels, other benthic 

invertebrates and algae (Zander, 1986), and it is not known to feed of fish larvae, not 

being therefore a known painted goby predator. To test the relation between these 

species, in laboratory conditions, P. pictus larvae were present to adult L. trigloides and 

there were no predator-prey response. Therefore, this species was probably not the 

most appropriate choice to test a predator response. When larvae reared in low pH 

conditions were tested, their behavioural response significantly changed, strongly 

avoiding L. trigloides odour (81% of the time). Although L. trigloides is not a painted 

goby predator, such behaviour may represent a sensorial impairment, responding 

larvae to an odor they should not react. Such predator-prey response, in natural 

conditions, would require energy consumption which otherwise could be used in 

growth and development. This result suggests that seawater acidification can cause 

damage in the larval olfactory mechanism, resulting in a confusion error in the 

detection of important olfactory cues for larval survival of some reef species. Examples 

of these cues are those used in the recognition of a predator or in the selection of a 

suitable habitat (cues that could help them locate and navigate towards reef habitat 

and select an appropriate settlement site). Thus, larvae will not adequately respond to 

odours that they may be subjected in their environment. Previous studies have also 

verified changes in chemosensory behavioural response of fish larvae reared in 

acidified pH. Munday et al. (2009) for example, verified that clownfish (Amphiprion 

percula) larvae  reared in lower pH conditions than the current-day, loosed their 

olfactory ability, showing preference for odours of inappropriate habitats and failing to 

avoid predator cues. Dixson et al. (2010) also verified in their work a reduction in 

olfactory predator detection in clownfish larvae reared in acidified water. Larvae 

became strongly attracted to the smell of predators (also reported by Munday et al., 

2010 and Nilsson et al., 2012).

 4.2. Auditory cues 

As observed in the olfactory tests, the two target species responded differently to the 

broadcast reef sounds.  

Contrary to what was expected sand-smelt larvae reared in both control and low pH 

conditions did not show any preference/avoidance to the reef sounds. In previous 

studies using light traps, a higher density of larvae were caught in traps broadcasting 

reef noises (Tolimieri et al., 2000; Leis et al., 2003; Simpson et al., 2004). Moreover, 

patch reefs associated with reef recordings showed higher natural settlement rates, 

comparing to silent control patches (Simpson et al. 2005b). There may be three 

possible explanations for the lack of responses in the larvae of this specie. First of all, 

since sand-smelt is a specie with pelagic life, not having a bipartite life cycle, in other 

words, remain in the pelagic environment as adults, possibly these larvae do not need 

to show any response to reef noise. Unlike reef fish larvae, these kind of larvae do not 

need to locate a reef for settlement. Tolimieri et al. (2000) also did not verify any 

response of pelagic fish larvae to reef sounds emitted by an underwater loudspeaker 

associated to a light trap. In addition, this specie has a particular life cycle. Adult sand-

smelt spawn inshore in very shallow waters, hatching a larva very well developed that 

remains inshore in shoals (Bamber et al., 1985). Only in the adult phase, they move 

away from the shallow water edge (Bamber et al., 1985). Again, these larvae do not 

require the reef sounds for guidance, and do not need to show, therefore, any 

response to reef noises. The third possibility is that the sounds used in the present 

study were out of the sand-smelt hearing sensitivity. Wright et al. (2010) tested, by 

using the Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR), an electrophysiological technique that 

can define thresholds of hearing, the auditory abilities of larvae of four coral reef fish 

species (Lutjanus carponotatus, Pomacentrus amboinensis, Pomacentrus nagasakiensis 

and Plectropomus leopardus) and of similar-sized individuals of two pelagic species 

(Elagatis bipinnulata and Gnathanodon speciosus). Five of the six species studied, 

detected frequencies between 100 - 2000 Hz, however, for E. bipinnulata the range of 

frequencies heard was until 800 Hz. They also verified that larvae of coral reef species 

had significantly more sensitive hearing at all frequencies tested than their pelagic

counterpart species. Nevertheless, the authors hypothesize that such differences may 

have a phylogenetic basis, instead of an adaptive basis, since the pelagic species tested 

were of a different family than the coral reef species. Due to the lack of proper 

apparatus to perform the ABR method, it was not possible to measure the hearing 

sensitivity of the larvae used in this study. It was therefore not possible to verify and 

confirm that sand smelt larvae were not able to detect the daytime reef sounds. The 

hypothesis of a masking effect by the background noise to justify the lack of response 

by sand smelt larvae to the reef sounds should not be put aside. However, once again, 

it was not possible to know the hearing thresholds of these larvae. In future works it 

would be interesting to analyze the response of sand-smelt larvae to different coastal 

habitats sounds. According to Radford et al. (2010) these habitats have significant 

distinct underwater sound signatures which might transmit information for a long 

distance about direction and habitat quality being probably extremely importance for 

pelagic larval stages of coastal marine organisms. 

Painted goby larvae reared in control conditions strongly avoided the daytime reef 

noises (73% of the time spent at opposite speaker side). Although this might seem 

unexpected given that this is a reef dependent species, the result agree with previous 

field research. Heenan et al. (2009), used for the first time light traps broadcasting 

daytime reef noises and, contrary to what was expected, they verified that larval fish 

were not attracted to these kind of sounds. Other studies also showed that during the 

day, larvae move away from reefs, to avoid reef-based predators and to feed (Leis &amp;amp; 

Carson-Ewart, 1998; Stobutzki &amp;amp; Bellwood, 1998; Kingsford et al., 2002). In turn, during 

the night, larvae move towards reefs to settle (Stobutzki &amp;amp; Bellwood, 1998; Tolimieri et 

al., 2000; Leis &amp;amp; Carson-Ewart, 2003; Simpson et al., 2004; Simpson et al., 2005b; 

Simpson et al., 2008b).  In general, settlement-stage reef fishes are specially attracted 

by high-frequency sounds of reefs (mainly produced by invertebrates) (Simpson et al., 

2008b), contrary to adults and juveniles reef fishes that are more attracted by low-

frequency sounds produced by other fishes (Simpson et al., 2008a). When larvae 

reared in 7.6 pH treatment were tested, their behaviour was significantly different. 

These larvae have reversed or lost their auditory preferences, showing absence of 

response to sounds (53% of the time spent at opposite speaker side). Similar results

were shown in a previous study where it was found a change in the directional 

response of juvenile clownfish (Amphiprion percula) reared in acidified conditions to a 

reef day recording (Simpson et al., 2011).  This result suggests that the low 

acidification levels can compromise essential auditory behaviours for survival. It also 

suggests that for painted goby larvae, the responses to auditory cues are unlike to 

compensate the potential loss of other senses that acidification may cause, such as 

olfactory impairment.  

In order to anticipate the impacts of ocean acidification on fish behaviour, it is 

essential to understand the mechanism behind the changes of sensory and 

behavioural responses. Otoliths (fish earbones) are sensory aragonite structures that 

help in balance, orientation and sound detection. Their size and morphology influence 

hearing capacity. These organs are able to detect sound due the movement of particles 

that sounds create in the water (Popper et al., 2003; Popper et al., 2005). Increasing 

concentrations of CO2 expected for future may affect the growth of these structures, 

but little is known about how they will be affected. Results on the potential impacts of 

high levels of CO2 (low pH) in otoliths of coral reef fish, seem to indicate that larvae are 

tolerant to moderate increases in environmental CO2 (Munday et al., 2011a, b; 

Simpson et al., 2011). In contrast, experiments on larvae of white sea bass 

(Atractoscion nobilis) showed a higher otolith growth with elevated CO2 concentrations 

(Checkley et al., 2009). These opposite results could be due to different CO2 levels used 

on the mentioned studies (Checkley et al., 2009: ~1000 ?atm and 2500 ?atm; Munday 

et al., 2011a, b; Simpson et al., 2011: up to ~ 1050 ?atm). It can also be assumed that 

there are intra- and inter-specific (even being sympatric and sharing the same ecology 

and life history) variations in CO2 tolerance on fishes, where some individuals might 

not be affected by the changes in CO2 concentrations (also based by Munday et al., 

2010; Ferrari et al., 2011). Therefore, in future studies, it would be interesting  to 

analyze otolith morphology and check if there are differences in size and/or shape 

depending on the pH conditions where larvae are reared (perform a similar procedure 

to Checkley et al., 2009).

Mechanisms of behavioural impairment 

Nilsson et al. (2012) hypothesized that the changes in the behavioural and sensory 

responses happen probably because the high CO2 concentrations, and hence lower pH, 

interfere with the neurotransmitter function in fish. Gamma-aminobutyric acid type A  

(GABA-A) is the main neurotransmitter receptor in the vertebrate brain (Bormann et 

al., 1987). Nilsson et al. (2012) proposed that, in acidified conditions, ionic shifts (in Cl
-
 

and/or HCO3
-
 gradient) would occur over neural membranes, which would cause a 

reversal of GABA-A receptor function in some neuronal circuits. This would affect 

behavior and originate severe modifications in sensory preferences. The authors 

confirmed this hypothesis by showing that the atypical behavioral effects resultants 

from the acidified conditions were reversed by using a treatment with a GABA-A 

receptor antagonist (gabazine). Hamilton et al. (2014) also demonstrated that 

acidification impairs neurophysiology of fish, affecting GABA-A receptor function. The 

authors verified that in juvenile rockfish (Sebastes diploproa), high CO2 levels (1125 ± 

100 µatm) increased their anxiety behaviour compared with control conditions (483 ± 

40 µatm). Then, by applying GABA-A receptor modulators they showed that, in 

contrast to the antagonist gabazine,  the GABAA-receptor agonist muscimol caused a 

large increase in anxiety in fish. Those results are consistent with the changes in Cl
-
 ion 

flux through these receptors in acidified conditions. Thus, for a result analysis even 

more rigorous, one could also have treated the group of larvae that showed an 

abnormal auditory preferences with a GABA-A receptor modulator, in order to verify if 

the changes that happened due to the high CO2 concentrations interfered with the 

neurotransmitter function in fish (perhaps with an antagonist of the GABA-A receptor 

likewise Nilsson et al. (2012) did with olfactory preferences and behavioural 

lateralization of larval coral reef fish). This procedure should be considered in future 

experiments.  

The capacity for most marine organisms to adapt to the ocean acidification has been 

poorly studied, yet it is unlikely that many marine species have genetic variation 

adapted to this fast change. Probably, only species with very rapid generation times 

will be able to keep pace with change and adapt (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007). Most 



Acidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae 

 

38 
 

of the research already performed that focuses in pH and ?CO2 sensitivities of marine 

organisms is based almost entirely on short-term perturbation experiments. It will be 

important in the future to place long-term experiments (with several generations), 

since it may occur acclimation (plasticity in phenotype within and between generations) 

and adaptation by selection of favorable genotypes. There are already some studies 

that did so for some marine organisms (Burkhardt et al. 1999; Collins &amp;amp; Bell 2004), 

showing different adaptive responses. Since it is more difficult to perform long-term 

experiments with fish, one could at least perform this study with the offspring of 

progenitors of acidified environment, likewise Munday et al. (2009) and Dixson et al. 

(2010) did on their research.  

The TA values of seawater in this study were higher in both control and acidified 

treatment (~2500 and ~3000 µmol Kg
-1 

SW, respectively), comparing with those 

described from the natural sweater (2325 µmol Kg
-1 

SW; Barry et al., 2010) and with 

many of previous studies in ocean acidification. However, these values are within the 

range reported in nearshore waters of the southern Iberian Peninsula (de la Paz et al., 

2007, 2008). In addition, during a spring upwelling episode, Cabeçadas &amp;amp; Oliveira 

(2005) observed even higher values (4600 ?mol kg-1) in a location near to the sampling 

area of the present study. These authors also reported in their study area extreme 

values of ?CO2 (470-1770 ?atm) that are probably due to the transport of higher 

quantities of inorganic carbon from deep, colder upwelled water. The nearshore 

coastal regions often experience seasonal high ?CO2 values, therefore their future 

?CO2 levels will probably exceed the 1000-1200 ?atm (?pH 0.4-0.5) projected for 2100 

(Meehl et al., 2007). It is of extreme importance to improve the knowledge about 

seawater carbonate chemistry in different oceanic systems, especially of coastal 

systems in order to understand better the future consequences of ocean acidification.

5. Final considerations   

In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that larvae of some species are sensitive 

to the potential future ocean acidification scenario, caused by the uptake of additional 

CO2 at the ocean surface. It may disrupt the behavioural response to both olfactory 

and auditory cues that may be essential for site selection at settlement in some 

temperate reef fish larvae and for their survival. This will reduce the recruitment 

success and will have consequences in long term for the sustainability of adult fish 

populations, affecting significantly marine biodiversity. These results strengthen the 

need to reduce the anthropogenic CO2 emissions in order to prevent the 

intensification of ocean acidification and to ensure the protection and conservation of 

marine ecosystems and communities.  

This was a study of great importance in the topic of prediction of the consequences 

resultant from increased CO2 concentrations in the ocean. Upon our knowledge, it was 

the first research that studied the effects of pH changes in the sensorial behaviour, 

both auditory and olfactory of temperate reef fishes. More research is needed in this 

area, both performing this study on more species (because not all species of fish larvae 

respond in the same way to alterations in pH) and improving the experimental 

methodology, so try to understand better the repercussions of it. In addition, since 

global temperature rise will act simultaneous with ocean acidification (Raven et al., 

2005), it would be also of great importance to study the effect of the interaction 

between these two factors.
