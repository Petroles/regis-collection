abstract 

 
The ultra-high hydrostatic pressure processing (UHP) is an expanding 
technology used mostly in food industry for the pasteurization of foods while 
preserving their organoleptic properties. This technique may be also applied to 
introduce structural and functional changes in biomolecules including cellulose. 
Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of UHP towards cellulosic 
pulps, namely the ability to promote forced fibre hydration thus improving 
cellulose accessibility and fibrils reorganization. The main purpose of this thesis 
was the evaluation of UHP potential for the modification of recycled fibres 
aiming to improve its performance in the production of tissue paper in 
collaboration with the biggest national producer Renova FPA, S.A.  
The present study has identified the structural changes that occurred in 
cellulose of recycled pulp induced by UHP. Thus the crystalline regions 
demonstrated to some extent the co-crystallization of appropriately oriented 
crystallites and the recrystallization of paracrystalline regions as demonstrated 
by XRD and 13C NMR. In addition, UHP have induced fibrils disaggregation 
upon forced hydration thus enhancing their accessibility towards water and 
chemical reagents. A substantial reduction of recycled fibres hornification upon 
UHP has been suggested. UHP-processed recycled fibres also demonstrated 
the increment of strongly bound water content, as revealed by thermal analysis 
and by FTIR of deuterated samples. Changes in physical structure of cellulose 
caused the enhancement of such properties of recycled pulp as accessibility, 
hydrophilicity, moisture sorption capacity, surface contact angle, capillarity, 
among others.  
The effect of beating (B) before (B-HP) or after the UHP (HP-B) or between two 
beating stages (B1-HP-B2) on the drainability and mechanical properties were 
evaluated. In these studies, basic papermaking properties and, especially, the 
capillarity (up to 112%) were improved. The most advantageous from the point 
of view of strength properties of tissue paper production was suggested to be 
the B1-HP-B2 sequence suitable both for recycled fibres and softwood fibres. A 
synergetic effect of UHP on the beating of recycled cellulosic fibres has been 
detected allowing up to 50% energy savings in refining. At the same time, the 
UHP effect on the virgin fibres refinability was much more moderated.  



 

  



 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

The enhanced accessibility of recycled pulp upon UHP was also used to 

improve its ability towards targeted chemicals, enzymes and nano-sized 

structures. These experiments were carried out also with dried virgin fibres 

used as the models of recycled pulp. As concerns enzymes, it was suggested 

that enzymatic modification improves significantly the papermaking properties 

of recycled pulp. These improvements were related with selective removal of 

xylan bound to impurities and to aggregated cellulose fibrils on the fibre surface 

thus favouring the ensuing swelling and inter-fibre bonding in paper. UHP pre-

treatment and posterior enzymatic treatment revealed a synergetic effect on the 

mechanical properties of recycled pulp. This fact was assigned to enhanced 

accessibility of fibres towards xylanase by forced hydration and favourable 

rearrangement of cellulosic fibrils in fibres after UHP pre-treatment. The 

increase of basic strength properties after UHP and promoted by xylanase 

treatment was up to 30%, being the most pronounced for the tensile strength 

and the burst resistance.  

The impregnation of dyes in combination with UHP also has demonstrated an 

enhancement in impregnation/fixation of dye molecules. However, a high 

dependence was found on the equilibrium between dye, fixative and cellulosic 

fibres, depending on the dye used, both with and without UHP. This behaviour 

was assigned to specificity of dyes molecular structure, affinity, substantivity, 

among others. 

The impregnation of humectant compounds applying UHP was also evaluated 

and the improved hygroscopicity of treated pulp was confirmed. This fact was 

evidenced by capillarity, water absorption capacity and moisture sorption tests.  

The effect of UHP on the impregnation of antimicrobial agent in fibres has been 

carried out using polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB). Being a cationic 

polymer, PHMB was readily absorbed in fibres with and without UHP treatment. 

However, UHP allowed higher PHMB uptake and better retention after leaching 

when compared to conventional impregnation without UHP. This was attributed 

to stronger interactions between cationic PHMB and cellulose due to the 

deeper penetration of the antimicrobial agent under UHP treatment. However, 

the amount of PHMB to impregnate in fibres is limited because of its negative 

effect on paper strength properties due to disruptive action of PHMB as 

debonding agent. 

Likewise, silica encapsulated PHMB demonstrated fairly high retention upon 

UHP and high release during the leaching tests. Being encapsulated, PHMB 

was not directly bound to cellulose (electrostatic interaction) and the final paper 

showed at the same time fairly high PHMB release rates. 

The impregnation with encapsulated perfumes (Dovena New) was also carried 

out and revealed higher impregnation of these nano-sized structures upon UHP 

than under conventional conditions. This was reflected by a higher release of 

volatiles from pulp samples impregnated with stuffed nanoparticles under UHP 

treatment when compared to pulps samples with free adsorbed nanoparticles.

Resumo O processamento de alta pressão hidrostática (UHP) é uma tecnologia em 
expansão, bastante utilizada na indústria alimentar para a pasteurização de 
alimentos, ao mesmo tempo que preserva as suas propriedades organoléticas. 
Esta técnica pode ainda ser aplicada na modificação estrutural e funcional de 
biomoléculas, tais como a celulose. Em estudos recentes demonstrou-se o 
potencial da UHP para com pastas celulósicas, nomeadamente no que diz 
respeito à sua capacidade de promover a hidratação forçada das fibras e, 
consequentemente, melhorar a acessibilidade das mesmas e ainda promover 
a reorganização das suas fibrilas. Posto isto, o principal objetivo desta 
dissertação consistiu na avaliação do potencial da UHP na modificação de 
fibras recicladas e virgens, para alcançar a melhoria da sua performance na 
produção de papéis tissue, em colaboração com uma das maiores empresas 
nacionais do ramo, a Renova FPA, SA. 
No presente estudo foram identificadas alterações estruturais na celulose, 
tanto em fibras recicladas como em virgens, produzidas pelo UHP. Neste 
sentido, as regiões cristalinas demonstraram, até certa extensão, a co-
cristalização de cristalitos convenientemente orientados e a recristalização de 
regiões paracristalinas, tal como evidenciado por XRD e 13C RMN. Para além 
disso, a UHP induziu ainda a desagregação das fibrilas, aquando o fenómeno 
de hidratação forçada, originando maior acessibilidade à água e a reagentes 
químicos. Sugere-se ainda a ocorrência de uma redução significativa da 
hornificação das fibras. Fibras processadas por UHP também demonstraram 
um incremento na presença de água fortemente ligada, tal como sugerido por 
análises térmicas e FTIR de amostras deuteradas. As alterações produzidas 
na celulose originaram uma melhoria nas propriedades das fibras, 
nomeadamente da sua hidrofilicidade, sorção de vapor de água, ângulo de 
contacto de superfície, capilaridade, etc. 
 
  
 

 

  



  



 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

O efeito da refinação (B) antes (B-HP), ou depois da UHP (HP-B), ou entre 
refinações (B1-HP-B2), também foi analisado no que diz respeito à 
drenabilidade e propriedades mecânicas das fibras. Nestes estudos, as 
propriedades papeleiras e em especial a capilaridade (112%) revelaram 
melhorias. Com base nos resultados sugere-se que a sequência B1-HP-B2 
seria a mais vantajosa para fibras recicladas e fibras virgens longas. Para além 
disso, o efeito sinergético da UHP com a refinação sugere ainda a 
possibilidade de uma poupança de 50% de energia na refinação. 
As melhorias induzidas pela UHP na acessibilidade de fibras celulósicas foram 
também utilizadas para otimizar a impregnação de químicos, enzimas e 
nanoestruturas. No que diz respeito às enzimas, verificou-se que a 
modificação enzimática de fibras celulósicas promoveu melhorias significativas 
nas propriedades papeleiras destas, em especial das fibras recicladas. Estes 
resultados foram relacionados com a remoção seletiva de xilana ligada a 
impurezas e a fibrilas na superfície das fibras, que consequentemente 
favoreceu o intumescimento e a ligação entre fibras.  
A utilização de um pré-tratamento de UHP e um posterior tratamento 
enzimático revelaram um efeito sinergético nas propriedades mecânicas das 
fibras celulósicas, em especial nas fibras recicladas. Este facto foi relacionado 
com o aumento de acessibilidade nas fibras para com a xilanase, como 
consequência da hidratação forçada e rearranjo favorável das fibrilas originado 
pela UHP. A melhoria registada nas propriedades mecânicas das fibras, como 
resultado do pré-tratamento UHP e posterior tratamento enzimático, foi até 
30%, tendo demonstrado maior impacto nas propriedades de índices de tração 
e rebentamento. 
A impregnação de corantes com UHP também foi realizada e demonstrou uma 
melhor impregnação/fixação das moléculas de corante. No entanto, verificou-
se uma grande dependência no equilíbrio entre moléculas de corante, fixador e 
fibras celulósicas, dependendo no corante utilizado, com e sem alta pressão. 
Estas variações foram atribuídas à especificidade da estrutura molecular da 
molécula de corante, à sua afinidade, substantividade, etc. 
A impregnação de agentes humectantes com UHP também foi avaliada e a 
melhoria nas propriedades hidrofílicas de fibras celulósicas foi confirmada. 
Este facto foi evidenciado por testes de capilaridade, sorção de vapor de água 
e testes de capacidade de sorção de água.  
O efeito da UHP na impregnação de um agente antimicrobiano também foi 
estudado utilizando polihexametileno biguanide (PHMB). Sendo um polímero 
catiónico, o PHMB foi facilmente absorvido pelas fibras celulósicas, com e sem 
alta pressão. A UHP permitiu ainda uma melhor impregnação/retenção do 
PHMB, após lixiviação, quando comparado com a amostra impregnada sem 
UHP. Estes resultados foram relacionados com as fortes interações 
estabelecidas entre o PHMB catiónico e a celulose, devido a uma impregnação 
mais profunda do agente antimicrobiano durante o tratamento de UHP. No 
entanto, o teor de PHMB a impregnar nas fibras é limitado pelos efeitos 
negativos que este originou nas fibras como consequência da sua ação de 
interrupção das ligações entre fibras como “agente desligante”. 
Do mesmo modo, cápsulas de sílica com PHMB também demonstraram uma 
maior retenção nas fibras celulósicas com a utilização da UHP. Encapsulado, o 
PHMB não está diretamente em contacto com a celulose (interações 
electroestáticas), exibindo deste modo uma maior libertação de PHMB 
(limitação por difusão). 
A impregnação com perfumes (Dovena New) encapsulados também foi 
realizada e revelou uma maior impregnação destas nanoestrutras, com a 
utilização da UHP, relativamente à metodologia convencional. Isto foi refletido 
pela maior libertação de voláteis por parte das amostras impregnadas com 
cápsulas com perfumes.

 Chapter I | Introduction  

1.1. Introduction 

Tissue products market is the fastest growing market among industrially produced 

papers.
[1,2]

 Examples of tissue papers include toilet paper, kitchen towels, napkins, facial 

tissue paper, etc. All these products have been demonstrating increasing demand in modern 

societies, as diary used products for personal hygiene, and also in numerous domestic or 

industrial applications. 

Similarly to other industries, an effective and sustainable development are in the 

focus of tissue paper producers. This is particularly true for Renova a renowned Portuguese 

tissue paper producer. Renova is known not only for its high quality soft, absorbent tissue 

papers but also by its innovative products, such as black and strongly coloured toilet papers 

and napkins or facial papers with special features. 

For the manufacture of tissue paper, Renova uses a wide variety of pulp sources. 

These include primarily long (softwood) and short (hardwood) “dried virgin” fibres, but 

also a wide range of recycled fibres (from printed to packing papers). The tissue papers 

from Renova contain up to 70-80% recycled fibres. Yet, recycled fibres utilization still 

exhibits some major drawbacks, relatively to virgin fibres, which imply the addition of 

virgin fibres to surpass those limitations and maintain basic papers properties. Among the 

negative factors affecting recycled pulp properties, the hornification effect is recognized as 

the main responsible for recycled fibres losses (losses on physical and mechanical 

properties and on fibres hydration abilities). 
[3–10]

 

Studies previously carried out at the University of Aveiro have demonstrated the 

potential of hydrostatic ultra-high pressure to improve cellulosic fibres properties. In these 

studies it was found that UHP was able to introduce water in inaccessible regions of 

cellulosic fibrils that resulted in fibril rearrangements, resulting in their higher 

crystallization degree (larger crystallites), forced hydration (imprisonment of water 

molecules as strongly bound water), improved accessibility (towards chemicals and 

enzymes) and as a consequence the reduction of pulps hornification, which limited pulps 

properties, such as absorbency and mechanical properties.
[11–13]

, which are fairly relevant 

for tissue papers. 

Hence, the technique of hydrostatic ultra-high pressure is a suitable tool to improve 

properties of recycled fibres towards a new generation of tissue papers.

 Chapter I | Introduction 

1.2. Contextualization and Objectives 

The main goal of this work was the evaluation of hydrostatic ultra-high pressure, 

UHP, as a potential tool to enhance tissue paper properties. With this in mind, the main 

purposes of this study were to investigate the effect of ultra-high pressure on different 

types of fibres, commonly used by Renova for tissue paper production, recycled fibres and 

virgin fibres (hardwoods and softwoods) and recycled fibres. 

According to results of previous works
[11–13]

, the effect of UHP on Renova feedstock 

materials, commonly used for tissue productions, was investigated. The UHP effect was 

evaluated as concerns structural changes of fibres, its capacity towards hydration, fibres 

accessibility, etc. In this context, high expectation was laid on recycled fibres treatment 

with UHP.  

Since recycled fibres are heavily affected by hornification it was important to 

evaluate UHP effects on hornified fibres
[13,11,12]

, including their physico-chemical 

properties heavily affected by hornification. Besides, by reversing hornification the 

possibility of radical improvement of papermaking properties of recycled fibres in tissue 

paper production was also investigated. 

Besides recycle fibres, UHP effect on “virgin” dried but never used in papermaking 

pulps was also studied. Such virgin fibres are commonly used in the composition of tissue 

papers to provide critical properties such as absorbency, softness and adequate mechanical 

strength.
[14–16]

 The main idea was to verify if UHP treatment could improve the 

aforementioned pulp properties thus diminishing the dependence of tissue paper 

composition from virgin pulps. It was expected that under optimized UHP conditions the 

forced hydration of virgin fibres would provide structural changes favouring their 

mechanical, optical, adsorption and softness properties.
[13]

 The combination of beating and 

UHP was also considered to evaluate the effects behind the combination of both 

treatments. 

Taking into consideration that the strategic development lines of Renova are related 

to the production of strongly coloured tissue papers with specific consumer properties (e.g. 

highly absorbable, antimicrobial, perfumed, etc), the effect of UHP treatment on the dyeing 

process and on the accessibility towards various additives (antimicrobial agents, functional 

nanoparticles, humectants, fragrances and enzymes) was also evaluated.

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

2.1. Cellulosic fibres sources 

Cellulose is one of the most abundant polymers in nature. This polymer is found in 

different terrestrial plants in different amounts, e.g. more than 94% in cotton, 75-80% in 

hemp, 70-80% in flax, 60-65% in jute and 40-55% in wood. From all these cellulose 

sources, wood is the most relevant, since it is the main source of cellulosic pulp for 

papermaking.
[1,2]

 

2.1.1. Macroscopic structure of wood 

Wood is composed by a wide variety of tissues cells (Figure 2. 1). When a tree is cut 

by taking a closer look into its cross-section, from its outside to the inside, it is possible to 

distinguish different layers, the outer bark, the phloem, cambium, sapwood and heartwood. 

The outbark confers protection and avoids liquid losses, while phloem is the cells tissue 

responsible for transporting the nutrients through the plant. In the case of cambium, this 

layer is responsible for the growth (i.e. cell division, production of xylem and phloem). 

The new cells inside the cambium become cells in sapwood, and outside cells became cells 

in the phloem.  

Sapwood and heartwood are the tissues responsible for nutrients transport and 

strength and support, respectively. Xylem (layer created from the cambium to the centre) is 

the most important part of wood for paper industry. It mainly consists on longitudinal cells, 

whose primary functions are conduction, support and nutrient storage, as mentioned above. 

Also, radially oriented cells may be observed. In the xylem, the layers of early and late 

wood form well visible annual rings.
[3–5]

[6]

 

2.1.2. Microscopic structure of wood 

Wood cells are not all equal, they differ from tree to tree species. From these 

differences it is thus possible to divide wood into two types, hardwoods and softwoods.
[7,8]

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

2.1.2.1. Softwood 

Softwood belong to coniferous (gymnosperms) and is mainly composed by two types 

of wood cells, tracheids (90-95%) and ray parenchyma cells (5-10%) (Figure 2. 2).
[8]

  

Tracheids are long cells, featured by its length being much larger than its width. 

Their functions include mechanical support and water and nutrient transport. The water 

transport between cells occurs through pits. Being longitudinally orientated, cells exhibit 

many pits, which enable communication between neighbouring cells.
[4,8]

 

Ray cells are barely visible and appear as lines in a top-to bottom directions. They 

have approximately 15?m high by 10 ?m wide by 150-250?m long in the radial direction. 

These cells functions include nutrient storage and its lateral transport. Ray cells intercept 

tracheids, trough pits, which act as communication between cells 
[4,7]

  

 

Figure 2. 2 – Typical softwood cells (adapted from 
[8]

). 

2.1.2.2. Hardwoods 

Hardwood belongs to angiospermes and possess a structure far more complex than 

that of softwoods. All this complexity arises from the diversity of wood cells (Figure 2. 3), 

existent in hardwood, with a wide variety of functions, comparatively to softwood. 

Hardwood cells tissue consist mainly on libriform cells, (support function), vessels 

(transport function) and ray cells (storage function). It is also possible to find longitudinal 

tracheids (support function). 
[4,5,7,8]

 

Libriform cells are long, with a quite thick cell wall, with small cavities with pits, 

while vessels are not quite long cells, and exhibit a large width and thin cell wall, with 

opened or perforated extremities. This last are found linked one after the other, forming 

channels able to transport water in a more efficient way than tracheids on softwoods. 

Vessels may exhibit length between 0.3mm and 0.6mm, and width between 30 and 300?m. 

Its dimension may vary depending on the hardwood species.

vessels united, birch libriform fibre; birch tracheid; oak tracheid. Lower row left to right: oak early and latewood vessels, 

oak longitudinal parenchyma cells, birch ray parenchyma cell) (adapted from 
[8]

). 

2.1.3. Wood cell structure 

In wood cells, the cell wall is composed by several layers with distinct composition 

and organization. The thickness and percentage of each component may vary significantly 

according to cell type, origin, type of wood, etc. 
[4,8,9]

 

Cell wall is divided into different layers, the middle lamella (ML), primary wall (P) 

and the secondary wall, which is formed by the outer (S1), middle (S2) and inner (S3) layers 

(Figure 2. 4).
[4,5,8]

 Each layer is composed by a cellulose microfibril carcase, which is 

arranged around the cell in different directions (Figure 2. 4) The microfibril orientation 

differs from layer to layer being close to 90º in S1 and S3 and 10-20º in S2. In the primary 

wall microfibrils are not oriented.

Wood cells are glued together by means of the middle lamella, being this layer 

primal function cell adhesion. In its earliest stages it is mainly composed of peptides, 

evolving then into a highly lignified structure. The lignin content in this layer is the highest 

being 90-100%. 
[5,8]

The primary wall is the outer layer of cell wall, and consists on a thin layer, whose 

composition includes, mainly, cellulose, hemicelluloses, pectin and proteins, under a lignin 

matrix. On its most external part cellulose microfibrils are organized randomly, while in 

the interior they are orientated nearly perpendicularly to the cell axis.
[5,8]

  

The secondary wall, as mention before, can be divided into three layers, one thinner 

and more exterior, S1; an interior layer, S3 and a middle layer, S2 (Figure 2. 4). All layers 

are composed of microfibrils, embedded in a matrix of lignin and hemicelluloses.
[8]

 The 

outer layer, S1, is rather thin (0.2-0.3?m thick). Here microfibrils orientation is almost 

horizontal, with respect to cell axis, while in S2 it takes almost vertical orientation, 

followed once more by horizontal orientation, on S3.
[5,8]

 All these layers, have distinct 

composition, composed essentially by cellulose in a matrix of hemicelluloses and 

lignin.
[4,5,8]

 

2.1.4. Wood composition 

The chemical composition of wood cells varies significantly depending on the 

species. The amount of each compound may differ according with various factors such as, 

the tree age, the type of wood, the part of the tree (leaf, stem, root), geographic 

localization, climate, soil, etc. Nevertheless, overall, wood is best described as a composite 

made of cellulose networks, glued with lignin and hemicellulose, with minor amounts of 

extractives and inorganics.
[9,10]

 

 

Figure 2. 5 – Cellulose partial structure. 
[9] 

Cellulose is the main constituent of wood, and it consists on a linear polymer made 

of ?-D-glucopyranose units (Figure 2. 5). Its polymerization degree may go up to 10 000. 

On the other hand, hemicelluloses, are a group of lower weight polymers, made of 

different sugars units, such as D-glucose, D-mannose, D-galactose, D-xylose, L-arabinose, 

D-glucuronic acid and other less abundant sugars such as L-rhamnose or D-fucose (Figure 

2. 6).

Figure 2. 6 - Sugar monomers from wood hemicellulose (the designations D (dextrogyre) and L (levogyre) refers to the 

standard configurations for the two optical isomers of glyceraldehyde, the simplest carbohydrate, and designate the 

conformation of the OH group at carbon 4 (C-4) for pentoses (xylose and arabinose) and C-5 for hexoses (glucose, 

galactose, and mannose). Also, greek letters ? and ? refer to the configuration of OH group on C-1. The two 

configurations are called anomers.) (adapted from 
[9]

). 

There are several groups of hemicelluloses found in wood. Their constitution may 

include one or more types of sugars, and their designation is often formulated in agreement 

with their predominant sugar monomers, for example, galactoglucomanans, 

arabinoglucuronoxylans, glucomanans, glucoronoxylans, etc (Figure 2. 7). 
[3,9,11]

 

In hardwood, 4-O-methyl-glucuronoxylans, known as glucuronoxylans or xylans, are 

a class of predominant hemicelluloses on this type of wood (ca. 15-30% on wood). Its 

backbone is constituted by ?-D-xylose linked by ??1-4) bonds, with acetyl groups at C-2 or 

C-3 of the xylose units on an average of 5-7 acetyls per ten xylose units. This polymer is 

also substituted with sidechains of 4-O-methylglucuronic acid units linked to the 

hemicellulose backbone by ?(1-2) links with an average frequency of approximately one 

uronic acid group per ten xylose units. 
[9–11]

 Besides xylans, in hardwood, it is also possible 

to find glucomanans, (approximately 2-5%), which comprises a polymer constituted by D-

glucose and D-mannose units, with an approximate ratio of 1:1 to 1:2. 
[4,8]

 

In softwoods galactoglucomanans are predominant hemicelluloses, accounting for 

approximately, 20%. This polymer may be linear or slightly branched, and its backbone is 

constituted of D-glucose and D-mannose units, linked by ?(1-4) bonds with a molar ratio 

of 1:2 to 1:3, with branches containing galactose linked to the main backbone by ?(1-6) 

bonds.
[10,11]

 

Xylans from softwood are arabinoglucuronoxylans. This polymer backbone consists 

of D-xylose units linked by ?(1-4) links and branched with 4-O-methyl–?-D-

[9,11]

 

 

Figure 2. 7 – Structures of hemicelluloses commonly found on hardwood and softwood (adapted from

). 

Besides hemicelluloses, lignin is another major component of wood. It consists of a 

branched, amorphous polymer, obtained by radical polymerization of coniferyl, sinapyl 

and p-cumaryl alcohols (Figure 2. 8), where all phenylpropane units are linked by ether 

and carbon-carbon links. The most abundant bonds in lignin are ?-O-4 (40-60%), ?-5’(5-

10%), ?-?’(5-15%), 5-5’(5-15%) and 4-O-5’ (2-8%).
[12,13]

 

Lignin is distributed through all wood tissues, however, as previously mentioned, its 

concentration is the highest in the middle lamella. It plays a role as a glue in the cell wall 

containing cellulose fibrils.
[8,14]

Wood also contains small amounts of extractives, which consist mainly of fatty 

acids, resins, esters, wax, fats, polyphenolics and terpenes.

composition of some wood and non-wood plants is presented in Table 2. 1.

2.1.5. Cellulose 

Cellulose is a linear natural homopolymer composed of D-anhydroglucopyranose 

units (AGU), which are linked together by ??1-4) glycosidic linkages. Its linear structure is 

attributed to the type of linkages established between each AGU unit. The glucose residues 

are linked 180° towards each other, making the repeated unit a cellobiose residue (dimer) 

rather than a glucose residue (Figure 2. 5). 
[11,17–19]

 

2.1.5.1. Supramolecular structure 

Being a linear polymer with multiple OH groups, cellulose chains exhibit a high 

tendency to interact with each other (by hydrogen bonds) forming molecule bundles. The 

formation of a cellulose bundle is often referred to as elementary fibrils. This group of 

molecules, may be further divided into regions of higher or lower organization, crystalline 

and amorphous regions, respectively. Elementary fibril may also form aggregates, named 

microfibrils, which may also do the same, yielding macrofibrils (Figure 2. 9 and 

2.11Figure 2. 10).

 ). 

The surface of cellulose chains contain free OH groups, which are not only 

responsible for cellulose supramolecular structure but also for its chemical and physical 

properties. Hydroxyl groups interact with one another by hydrogen bonds, which 

comprises most of cellulose supramolecular structure. In cellulose two types of hydrogen 

bonds may be distinguished, intramolecular bonds (bonds between OH groups of adjacent 

AGU units in the same cellulose molecule) and intermolecular bonds (bonds between OH 

groups of adjacent cellulose molecules). While the first ones confer a certain stiffness to 

single chains, the second ones are responsible for the formation of cellulose 

supramolecular structure. 
[20,23,24]

 

Infrared spectroscopy (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and x-

ray diffraction (XRD) studies have enabled the identification of cellulose interactions and 

organization. 
[25]

 It has been demonstrated that cellulose establishes intramolecular bonds 

OH-3…O5’ and OH-2…O6’, which confer rigidity to the four ring layer configuration. 

Intermolecular hydrogen bonds OH-6…O3, also play a key role, since they bond cellulose 

layers laterally. 
[11,19,23,26,27]

 In Figure 2. 11 it possible to observe both inter and 

intramolecular bonds established by cellulose.

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

As the packing density of cellulose increases, crystalline regions are formed. The 

presence of crystalline regions on cellulosic materials brands it as paracrystalline and its 

percentage of crystalline material is usually around 60-70%. 
[9,19]

 

It is possible to find cellulose with different packing/conformations, and therefore 

with different unit cell parameters. The unit cell is the basis building block of a crystal, 

repeated infinitely in three dimensions. It is characterized by three vectors a, b and c and 

the angles between the vectors, ? the angle between b and c; ?, the angle between a and c; 

and ?, the angle between a and b.
[28]

 

Cellulose ability of exhibiting different conformations is a case of polymorphism, 

which in crystallography refers to the existence of more than one crystalline conformation. 

Cellulose has many polymorphs (cellulose I, II, III and IV), however cellulose I is the 

native predominant crystalline form of cellulose.
[19,28,29]

 

Cellulose I or native cellulose molecules are organized on a monoclinic unit cell, 

with two parallel running chains and with cell parameters a=8.35Å, b=10.3Å, c=7.9Å and 

?=96-97º (Figure 2. 11). 
[17,19,26]

 

 

Figure 2. 12 - Scheme illustrating cellulose monoclinic cell structure and its lattice planes (adapted from 
[19]

). 

As mentioned above, cellulose has many polymorphs, which exhibit different 

cellulose packing/organization. The type of conformation and packing displayed by 

cellulose chains differs from each polymorph and it may be accessed through the 

aforementioned methods (XRD, IR and NMR). Small variations on the unit cell may be 

found for the same polymorph depending on cellulose origin.
[17,19,28]

 

Cellulose I is the native and predominate crystalline structure, although it can be 

converted into the other polymorphs through a variety of treatments. Nevertheless, two 

forms of cellulose I exist, cellulose I? and cellulose I?. Cellulose I? appears dominantly in 

bacterial and algal celluloses and contains triclinic cell structure, while cellulose I? is

predominant in higher plants such as cotton and wood and contains monoclinic cells 

structure.
[19,27,29]

 

Cellulose I conformation may be altered, irreversibly, into other stable crystalline 

form, cellulose II. This process may be conducted by two distinct methods regeneration 

and mercerization. Regeneration process consists in the dissolution of cellulose with an 

appropriate solvent followed by its recrystallization. As for mercerization it is performed 

by inciting cellulose intracrystalline swelling with NaOH concentrated solutions, followed 

by its washing and recrystallization. The fact that the transition from cellulose I into 

cellulose II is irreversible, implies that cellulose II is a more stable form, with respect to 

cellulose I. 
[19,27,29]

 

Other cellulose polymorphs may be prepared from cellulose I. Such is the case of 

cellulose III, which is obtained by treatment of cellulose I with liquid ammonia or certain 

amines (e.g. ethylene diamine, EDA). Cellulose III may also be prepared from cellulose II. 

The difference on the starting material (cellulose I or II) either renders cellulose IIII or 

cellulose IIIII, respectively. Additionally, by treating cellulose III with high temperature 

and glycerol it is possible to achieve cellulose IV polymorph. Hence, once more, two types 

may be attained, either cellulose IVI or IVII, respectively, obtained from cellulose IIII and 

IIIII. 
[19,27,29]

 

2.1.6. Cellulose accessibility and its interaction with water 

In crystalline regions the interactions between cellulose chains are very strong, which 

explains the high resistance of cellulosic fibres and its insolubility towards most solvents. 

On the other hand, in its amorphous regions, the higher spacing between cellulosic chains 

and reduced organization enables a higher availability of free OH groups for interaction 

with other molecules, such as water. The fact that cellulose has its hydrophilic groups 

available, makes it highly hygroscopic, with high water absorption capacity.
[9,30]

 

As previously referred, cellulose in wood may be crystalline and amorphous and thus 

inaccessible and accessible. Accessibility refers to the availability of cellulose functional 

groups to water, chemicals, microorganisms, etc. Even though crystalline cellulose is 

inaccessible, its surface is accessible. Moreover, most of amorphous cellulose is accessible 

but is also covered with hemicelluloses and lignin, which affects negatively its 

accessibility. 
[9,19,30,31]

 

Cellulose accessibility has been investigated by many researchers considering 

different techniques, such as X-ray diffraction, absorption of infrared radiation, or even

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

exchange of hydroxyl hydrogen for deuterium or tritium.
[9,19,30–34]

 However, only moisture 

sorption isotherms will be further discussed in detail. 

2.1.6.1. Moisture sorption 

As mentioned above accessibility may be evaluated considering sorption experiments 

with inert gases (N2 or Ar) or with water vapour. In case of water, this last is able to 

interact with cellulose, by disrupting weaker hydrogen bond, not being able, however, to 

interfere with intern crystalline regions. The moisture uptake at certain conditions 

(temperature and relative humidity) is a rather relevant criteria when evaluating cellulosic 

fibres interaction with water. 
[19,35]

 

The determination of water vapour or moisture sorption isotherms is often used not 

only to evaluate materials accessibility, but also to analyse materials hydration. This 

information becomes crucial regarding the papermaking applications, when the hydration 

abilities of cellulosic fibres predetermines the fibres properties. 
[19,36]

 The composition of a 

cellulosic pulp, the presence of oxidised functional groups, fibres porosity, its surface area 

and its hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity are rather relevant factors, which may influence 

moisture sorption. Therefore, this method works as an indirect tool to evaluate the 

accessibility of free OH groups in fibres. 
[37]

 

Moisture sorption isotherm may be determined by means of three different 

measuring techniques: gravimetric, manometric or hygrometric methods. In the 

gravimetric method, the weight of the sample is measured using a scale, while in the 

manometric method, the vapour pressure of water is measured when it is in equilibrium 

with a sample at given moisture content. In the hygrometric methods, the equilibrium 

relative humidity with a sample at a given moisture content is measured.
[38] 

Moisture sorption isotherms can be achieved from completely dried samples, under 

an environment with controlled humidity, until equilibria is reached. The data is afterwards 

represented as moisture uptake at equilibrium (Xeq), as a function of water activity (aw), or 

relative humidity (RH%). In Equation 2.1 it is possible to observe the relationship between 

aw and RH%.

Materials water sorption is a process where water molecules progressively and 

reversibly combine with a material by chemisorption, physical adsorption, and multilayer 

condensation. An isotherm may assume the shape represented in Figure 2. 13 and it may be 

divided into three main regions. Region A represents strongly bound water (which includes 

structural water and monolayer water), whose enthalpy of vaporization is higher than that 



 

~ 24 ~ 

 

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

of pure water. Theoretically, in this layer the moisture content comprises the first layer of 

water molecules, which are sorbed by hydrophilic and polar groups of materials. These 

water molecules are unfreezable and hence not available for reaction or as plasticizers (the 

different types of water in cellulose will be further discussed later on 2.1.6.2.).
[19,37,38]

 

Region B represents the multilayer region, where water molecules are fairly strongly 

bound, on multiple layers but, not in direct contact with the adsorbent surface.
[39]

 Bonds 

are less intense, yet with an enthalpy of vaporization still higher than that of pure water. 

This region can be seen as a transition region from bound to free water. Here water 

molecules properties are closer to those of free water, and are available as solvent for low-

molecular weight solutes and for some biochemical reactions. Also, water molecules from 

this region usually do not freeze at normal freezing point.
[37,38]

 

 

Figure 2. 13 - Representation of a moisture sorption isotherm and the hysteresis phenomena associated with it (adapted 

from 
[38]

). 

In region C it is represented the region of capillary condensation, where the sorbed 

water is not bound by surface forces and is free to condense as liquid phase, within the 

molecular capillaries. The properties of water molecules start approaching those of bulk 

water. 
[37–39]

 

Between sorption and desorption (Figure 2. 13) the occurrence of hysteresis may be 

related with the nature and state of the components of materials, reflecting their potential 

for structural and conformational rearrangements, which alters the accessibility of 

energetically favourable polar sites. 
[35,37]

 

Moisture sorption isotherms may be classified according with Brunauer et al.
[40]

 and 

therefore be divided into five types (I, II, III, IV and V). 
[40,41]

 Type I isotherms, often 

referred to as Langmuir isotherms (monolayer coverage), are concave to aw axis and 

approach a limiting value as aw?1. This isotherm is typical on microporous materials. 
[40–



 

~ 25 ~ 

 

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

42]
 Type II isotherms are the usual on non-porous or macroporous adsorbents. Thus 

represent unrestricted monolayer-multilayer adsorption. The border between region A and 

B, is often taken to indicate the stage at which monolayer coverage is complete and 

multilayer adsorption is about to begin. It is typical on hydrophilic materials, such as 

cellulose, and is indicative if strong adsorbate-adsorbent interactions.
[41–43]

 Type III 

isotherms are convex to aw axis over its entire range and therefore do not exhibit 

monolayer. This type of isotherm suggests a hydrophobic surface, reluctant to accept 

water. It shows weak interaction between adsorbate and surface.
[41–43]

 Type IV isotherm 

are typical on mesoporous materials. The initial part of this isotherm is attributed to 

monolayer-multilayer adsorption, since it follows the same path as the corresponding part 

of a type II isotherm, but at higher aw the isotherm tends to a plateau. It reflects capillary 

condensation which result in effective reduction of available surface for further 

adsorption.
[41,42,44]

 Type V isotherms are uncommon and related with type III, with weak 

adsorbent-adsorbate interaction. They occur in porous adsorbents (either meso or 

microporous), such as the case of highly porous hydrophobic carbon materials with water 

vapour. Similarly to type IV, it represents mono and multilayer adsorption plus capillary 

condensation. 
[41,42,44]

 

 

Figure 2. 14 – Types of isotherms according with Brunauer et al.(adapted from
[38]

). 

Moisture sorption isotherms can be described by mathematical models, which are 

able to fit moisture sorption isotherms data in different environmental conditions. Many 

model equations have been developed and the approaches vary from empirical curve fitting 

to models based on various degrees of understanding of the mechanisms involved.
[36]

 

However, no model can be considered completely accurate, since for different water 

activities, different mechanisms of water molecules association may occur.
[36,37,45]

 

Numerous models can be found on literature, and these may be discriminated 

according with its main fundamentals (Table 2. 2), such as, models based on monolayer

In case of cellulosic materials BET and GAB models, especially GAB, have 

demonstrated rather good ability to fit and describe moisture sorption data on different 

cellulosic materials. 
[36,46]

 

Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET ) model 
[47]

, was proposed in 1938, and is widely 

used in food science. Its versatility allows to describe moisture sorption on different 

materials. It is typically used to describe type II and III isotherms, and from it, it is possible 

to estimate the monolayer coverage. However, only at water activities inferior to 0.45. 

[42,48]
 Its principles are based on the following hypothesis, (i) the rate of condensation on 

the first layer is equal to the rate of evaporation from the second layer, (ii) the binding 

energy of all of the adsorbate on the first layer is the same, and (ii) the binding energy of 

the other layers is equal to that of pure adsorbate.
[36,42,45]

 

BET equation is represented in Table 2. 2, where Xeq is the moisture uptake at 

equilibrium, Xm is the monolayer moisture content, aw the water activity, and C a constant. 



 

~ 27 ~ 

 

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

Guggenheim, Anderson and de Boer isotherm model (GAB), is also a well-known 

and quite versatile model, not only widely used on food science, but also for cellulosic 

materials. It is considered to be a refinement of Langmuir and BET theories, with three 

parameters, with physical meaning. 
[36,42,45,49]

 

In Table 2. 2 is represented GAB model equation, which is much similar to that of 

BET. Similarly to BET, Xeq is the moisture uptake at equilibrium, Xm is the monolayer 

moisture content, aw the water activity, and C and k are constants. When k=1, GAB model 

turns into BET model. 
[36,42,45,49]

 

From parameter Xeq, it is also possible to estimate the sorbent’s specific surface area 

(S, m
2
/gsolid) as displayed by Equation 2.2, where Mw is the adsorbate molecular weight, Na 

the Avogadro number, and Am is the effective cross-sectional area of the adsorbate 

molecule (0.125nm
2
 for water at 298 K). 

[50]
 

? = ?? [

As mentioned previously, GAB parameters have a physical interpretation. Parameter 

C represents a dimensionless parameter related with the heat of sorption of monolayer, i.e. 

it is a way of accessing the strength of binding between water and primary binding sites. 

Higher values of C, suggest stronger interactions between water molecules from the 

monolayer and the sorbent surface.
[37,42,49]

 

Parameter k, it is also a dimensionless parameter, but now related with the heat of 

sorption of the multilayer. When k approaches 1, there is almost no distinction between 

multilayer molecules and liquid ones. Under this circumstance water molecules past the 

monolayer are not organized in multilayer, however, exhibit similar features of those from 

liquid water. On the other hand, the more molecules are organized in multilayer, lower is k. 

The temperature dependence is also considered on GAB parameters C and k, this 

dependence is shown by Equations 2.3 and 2.4.

 Here C0 and k0 are constants of entropic nature. The first is defined as the 

accommodation function between the first layer and multilayer, while the second 

represents the accommodation function between bulk water and multilayer. Usually C0 

exhibits values smaller than 1, due to molecules preference for the multilayer, while k0 

values are expected to be higher than 1, due to the high entropy of molecules in 

liquid.
[37,42,49]

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

Parameters ?Hc and ?Hk represent the difference in enthalpy between monolayer 

(H1) and multilayer (Hq), and the difference in enthalpy between bulk water (Hl) and 

multilayer (Hq), respectively. The first is usually positive, given the exothermic nature of 

water and primary site for sorption, while the other is often negative and smaller, since the 

multilayer molecules are bound more loosely. Nevertheless, positive values are possible 

and have been observed in some foods as the result of endothermic dissolution of fruit 

sugars. 
[37,49]

  

The heat involved in the sorption of moisture can also be estimated. The net isosteric 

heat of sorption (?Hs) evaluates the binding energy existing between the water molecules 

(vapour state) and the sorbent. It is derived according to the Clausiys-Clayperon equation 

(Equation 2.5) for constant moisture. From this parameter it is also possible to determine 

total heat of sorption, Qs, by adding the heat of water vaporization (?Hv), (Equation 2.6).

2.1.6.1.1. States of water 

Water may be found associated with different materials differently, namely, either on 

in its free or bound form.
[35,51]

 Bound water exhibits different properties, relatively to that 

of free water. It is noteworthy the reduced mobility of the first relatively to the second, due 

to its bound situation. As concerns cellulose, water molecules mobility is restrained by the 

presence of cellulose OH groups, with which they interact. Some features of this kind of 

water include lower vapour pressure, superior bounding energy, reduced mobility, inability 

to freeze at low temperatures and unavailability to act as solvent.
[35,51]

 

Bound water may by further subcategorized into nonfreezing bound water and 

freezing bound water. Nonfreezing bound water consists on water molecules that are not 

detected during DSC (differential scanning calorimetry) and may be determined by the 

difference between the total water measured gravimetrically and the amount of water 

detected by DSC analysis. When considering water sorption at the fibres surface, it is 

possible that the first, up to the three first layers of water bound to cellulosic fibres surface, 



 

~ 29 ~ 

 

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

are not able to freeze. This inability is related with the limitations under water molecules 

motion imposed by the interactions with cellulosic fibres surface. 
[35,51,52]

 

As regards freezing bound water, contrarily to the previous case, a phase-transition is 

observed, but at temperatures lower than that of bulk water. Since, the strength of the 

hydration interaction decreases with the distance from the material surface, so water 

molecules associated with the surface may be frozen at lower temperatures. Studies to 

access materials states of water may be carried out through methods such as DSC or NMR. 

[35,51,52]
 

2.2. Paper feedstocks 

In pulp and paper industry the feedstock used may vary greatly. It mainly consists on 

fibrous raw material which may include primary or secondary fibres. Being primary fibres 

obtained directly from plant raw materials (mainly from wood or other non-wood plants) 

and secondary fibres being produced from recovered paper.
[53]

 Considering the feedstocks 

used for each type of fibres production, these will be divided respectively into virgin fibres 

and recycled fibres. 

2.2.1. Virgin pulps 

Wood is the main raw material used to produce cellulosic pulp. Pulping processes are 

used to produce cellulosic pulp, and its main purpose consists on liberating cellulosic fibres 

from the wood matrix. In principal, this can be achieved by mechanical, chemi-mechanical, 

semi-chemical and chemical pulping processes. Additionally, depending on pulps end-use, 

a bleaching process may follow the pulping process, in order to improve its brightness. 
[54–

57]
 

2.2.1.1. Mechanical and chemi-mechanical pulps 

Mechanical pulping is the original form of pulping. It separates fibres from each 

other by using only mechanical attrition to wood, with no chemicals (other than water or 

steam).
[56–59]

 The aim of mechanical pulping resides in maintaining the main part of lignin 

(and other wood components) to achieve high yield pulp, with satisfactory strength and 

brightness properties. Mechanical pulping processes exhibit pulp yields of about 90-98%, 

depending on what mechanical pulping method is being used. However, it usually requires 

high amount of energy when compared to chemical pulping. 
[54,57,58]

 

Mechanical pulps are featured as high yield (high wood components content), high 

bulk, high stiffness, and low cost pulps. Their low strength is associated with lignin 



 

~ 30 ~ 

 

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

interference with interfibre bonding. The presence of high lignin content may also cause 

pulp to turn yellow upon light or air exposure. 
[57,58]

 

Furthermore, apart from fibres, mechanical pulp is also known to display a 

considerate content of smaller structures named fines (pieces from fibres wall and broken 

fibres), which are responsible for mechanical pulps optical properties. 
[54,56–58]

 

The main processes applied for mechanical pulp production include stone 

groundwood pulping (SGW), pressure groundwood pulping (PGW), refiner mechanical 

pulping (RMP), thermo-mechanical pulping (TMP), or chemi-thermo-mechanical pulping 

(CTMP). 
[56,57][55]

 

Groundwood mechanical pulp is produced by grinding wood logs, with grindstones 

on the tangential and radial surfaces (SGW). It may also be prepared by pressurizing the 

grinder with steam at temperatures of 105-125°C. In this case wood is heated and softened 

before the grinding process, to improve the separation of fibres with less fibres cutting and 

less fines generation (PGW). Another example of mechanical pulping is the refiner pulping 

process (RMP), here pulp is produced by disintegration of chips that are fed to two refining 

discs, at atmospheric pressure conditions. 
[54,57][55]

 

Modifications on mechanical pulping methods may also be performed to produce 

pulp with a higher amount of long fibres. In these processes lignin may be softened by 

increasing process temperature. In this case wood chips are pre-treated with steam 

(approximately 120ºC), before entering the refiners (TMP). It is also possible to combine 

chemical treatments with mechanical pulping. In that case, wood chips are embedded with 

sodium sulfite solution to sulfonate lignin and to soften its structure, hence turning easier 

fibres separation (CTMP).
[54,55,57]

  

Depending on the applications, it is also possible to brighten mechanical pulps with, 

for example, hydrogen peroxide and/or sodium sulfite. These chemicals only brighten the 

pulp and do not permanently bleach it.
[58]

 

The use of mechanical pulps is confined mainly to non-permanent papers like 

newsprint and catalogue paper. Mechanical pulps constitute 20-25% of the world 

production and this is increasing due to the high yield of the process and increasing 

competition for fibre resources. 
[57]

 

2.2.1.2. Chemical pulp 

Besides mechanical pulping, cellulosic pulp may also be produced by chemical 

pulping. In this process the main purpose consists on solubilizing and remove lignin from 

wood, so that very little mechanical treatment is required to separate wood fibres from

each other. There is a wide variety of chemical pulping methods and each has its own 

specific advantages and disadvantages. The most common pulping processes known 

include the soda pulping, kraft pulping and sulfite pulping, although the kraft process 

accounts for the major part of chemical pulps produced all over the word. 
[54,55,57]

 

Comparatively to previous mechanical pulping methods, pulps produced by chemical 

pulping are more flexible, conform better to each other when forming paper and render 

good strength properties. The cooking procedures may either be continuous or batch-wise. 

[54,55]
  

Contrarily to mechanical pulping (high yield pulps) in chemical pulping, only 

approximately half of the wood becomes pulp, while the other part is removed. In this 

process, however, little electric energy is required for the process, since most of it is 

recovered along with most of the cooking chemicals, thanks to efficient recovery 

systems.
[54]

 

The produced pulp is coloured, and its degree of colouring varies with the pulping 

process. To produce certain paper grades that require high brightness pulp is bleached.
[54]

 

As regards the most commonly used chemical pulping processes these will be briefly 

scrutinized below. 

i) Soda pulping 

Soda pulping was one of the first chemical pulping methods invented and it uses 

sodium hydroxide for the chemical cooking process. After kraft process was discovered 

most soda mills were converted to the kraft process. The soda process still has limited use 

for easily pulped materials such as agriculture residues (e.g. straws) and some hardwoods, 

but it has lost most of its importance. Soda pulping of woods is possible while using 

anthraquinones as catalyst.
[57]

 

ii) Kraft pulping 

Kraft cooking is the dominant chemical pulping method. In this process the cooking 

liquor consists of a mixture of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium sulfide (Na2S), 

where OH
-
 and HS

-
 are the cooking active species. Here, whereas the last plays a key role 

on delignification, the other keeps lignin fragments in solutions. As previously mentioned, 

sodium hydroxide alone (soda process) was initially used as the alkaline pulping agent, 

however, with time, mills were then converted to the kraft process due to its ability to 

produce superior pulp. 
[54,55,57]

 

The cooking procedure can either be continuous or batch-wise. In a typical 

“cooking” process, wood chips are first pre-steamed to turn wood chips “softer” and to 



 

~ 32 ~ 

 

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

force out any entrapped air. Then, they are combined with a highly alkaline solution, the 

white liquor, which contains sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide. All these ingredients 

are blended together in a digester, where they are pressurized and cooked at 160-170ºC, 

over several hours. During this time, reactants permeate wood chips and dissolve most of 

its non-fibrous contents. The cooking conditions may vary, depending on the wood type or 

the desired pulp quality. 
[55,57,59]

 When finished the contents from the cooking process 

(pulp) are discharged from the digester into a blowtank. 
[54,57,59]

 

Owing to the use of high amounts of chemicals, its recovery and reuse becomes 

essential, not only due to economical issues, but also due to environmental issues (residues 

management). Therefore, in this process the inorganic chemicals, resultant from the 

pulping process, are recovered and regenerated for reuse. Additionally, large amounts of 

heat energy are generated/produced from the black liquor combustion.
[54,55,60]

 Typically, 

pulp and its liquor (black liquor), after the “cooking” process, are separated in a washing 

process. While pulp proceeds into bleaching (in case of bleached pulp production), "black 

liquor” is sent off to multi-effect evaporators to be concentrated. This process concentrates 

the dissolved organic matter (lignin and carbohydrate degradation products) leaving it in 

conditions to be burned in the recovery furnace. 
[55,60]

 The remaining NaOH and sodium 

salts of organic acids are converted to Na2CO3. Also during the combustion sodium sulfate 

is reduced to sodium sulfide by the carbon (Equations 2.8 and 2.9). Usually, sodium sulfate 

is added as makeup, being then reduced to Na2S by carbon. 
[55,60]

 

2NaOH + CO2 ? Na2CO3 + H2O   Equation 2. 8 

Na2SO4 + 4C ? Na2S + 4CO  Equation 2. 9 

Afterwards, the inorganic share on the bottom of the furnace (Na2CO3 and Na2S) is 

collected and dissolved in water. Then, the mixture, now "green liquor", is sent into the 

slaker, to get in contact with slaked lime and to turn Na2CO3 into NaOH (Equation 2.10). 

Since Na2S does not react with lime, the mixture of NaOH and Na2S ("white liquor") can 

be reused on another pulping process.

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

The resultant CaCO3 sludge is filtered off, burned in a lime kiln, and reused. 

Therefore, the chemical system is closed, which minimizes costs and pollution.  

Nevertheless, the kraft process still exhibits serious issues as concerns air pollution. 

These are essentially related with the release into the atmosphere of hydrogen sulfide, 

mercaptans, and other sulfur compounds, that exhibit a distinct bad odour. Still, the use of 

various techniques, such as black-liquor oxidation, improved evaporators and furnaces, and 

control of emissions has been able to mitigate this negative outcome. 
[54,55,57,60]

 

The kraft process is rather versatile since it may be used in any type of wood pulping 

process. Additionally, it is able to produce pulps with high strength, with a good energy 

efficiency and chemicals recovery. Although the disadvantages of this process include 

difficulties in the bleaching process comparatively to sulfite pulps, low yield (carbohydrate 

losses) and odour problems related with the emission of sulfur based compounds, that can 

be detected by the olfactory at 10 parts per billion. Although, as regards this last, it does 

not appear that this process will be supplanted in the near future; instead, it seems more 

likely to be improved and modified with time. 
[54,55,57]

 

iii) Sulfite pulping 

The sulfite pulping process is an example of other chemical pulping process. Here 

lignin is dissolved by sulfonation with an aqueous solution of sulfur dioxide and calcium, 

sodium, magnesium, or ammonium bisulfite, cooked at high temperature and pressure in a 

digester. Today, the dominating base used in sulfite pulping is magnesium.
[61]

 Calcium 

requires pH 2 to stay in solution, while magnesium allows pH values up to 4. In case of 

sodium and ammonium sulfite solutions these can be strongly alkaline without 

precipitation. Acid processes are those in which pH is between 2 and 3, bisulfite processes 

operate at pH range of 3-5, neutral sulfite processes in the range of pH 6-9, and alkaline 

sulfite processes are above pH 11. 
[62]

 

Regardless of the base used, the initial step of sulfite pulping consists on the 

preparation of the “cooking” liquor, which is commonly prepared at the mill by burning 

sulfur to produce SO2 and dissolving it in water to produce sulfurous acid (H2SO3). During 

combustion of sulfur, it is imperative to regulate the amount of oxygen to guarantee a 

complete oxidation and avoid over oxidation (formation of SO3). The SO2 gas is then 

rapidly cooled down (to minimize SO3 formation, that originates sulfuric acid in water), 

prior to reaction with water. After cooling down, the SO2 gas must be absorbed in water 

and react with the proper base to form the cooking liquor. Equation 2.11 to 2.14 represent 

the referred reactions, where M = Na, K, NH4, ½ Ca or ½ Mg (in aqueous solution)

In sulfite process, temperature control and uniform distribution of liquor play major 

roles. Heat is only supplied partially at the beginning, until uniform impregnation of wood 

chips is achieved. For a uniform impregnation of wood, long times are required. Sulfurous 

acid tends to penetrated wood chips rather rapidly, relatively to the base, leading to a high 

concentration of acid on the wood chips. So long times are required to allow bases to 

buffer the system and avoid wood chips to char. Afterwards temperature is further raised, 

until reaching a chosen value. At the end the pressure on the digester is reduced 

(decompression), which causes wood fibres to separate. Process conditions may vary 

according with wood species, ion base, temperature, pulping time (8-14h), amount of acid 

and ratio liquor to wood.
[55,57,61]

 

Overall, sulfite pulping exhibits yields between 40-52%, and produces medium 

strength pulp, with soft, flexible fibres. Lignin content is low, so pulps are easily bleached, 

being required less chemicals when compared with kraft process. 
[55,57,61]

 

There are four basic sulfite pulping processes currently in commercial use, these 

include acid sulfite, bisulfite, neutral sulfite, and alkaline sulfite processes. Being the main 

differences between one another the levels of acidity and alkalinity used to break down 

wood and remove lignin (Table 2. 3).

In sulfite processes it is also possible to perform chemical recovery of reactants. 

Overall, the process consists initially in the washing of the pulp liquor, then on its 

concentration, burning (heat generation during combustions), chemicals regeneration and 

by-products recovery. However, burning liquor to recover chemicals does not apply 

entirely to all chemicals. An example is ammonia that is converted into H2O and N2 

through the burning process. 
[55,57,61]

 

However, bases such as, Mg
2+

 and Na
+
 are possible to recover. For example, 

magnesium is possible to be recovered from burning of the cooking liquor, by recovery of 



 

~ 35 ~

gases as MgO. This last is posteriorly slurried in water to render Mg (OH)2 and then used 

to trap SO2 and generate Mg (HSO3)2.
[57,61]

  

Sulfite process, oppositely to kraft are unable to cook softwoods such as pine. 

However, the produced pulps have high alpha-cellulose content (“pure” cellulose content 

extracted from fibres, stable, with high polymerization degree), which are used to produce, 

for example, rayon. 
[57,61]

 

2.2.1.3. Semi-chemical pulps 

In addition to the methods previously described, it is also possible to conjugate both 

chemical and mechanical treatments to produce cellulosic pulp, semi-chemical pulp. In this 

case the wood chips are initially treated with a mild chemical treatment and then subjected 

to mechanical treatment (refining) to separate fibres from one another. In this process 

lignin and hemicelluloses are partially removed, rendering pulps with yield of 60-80%. The 

initial chemical treatment principles may be alike to those of chemical pulping (previously 

discussed), differing in process conditions such as cooking time, chemicals charge, etc. 

[55,57]
 

Neutral sulfite semi-chemical, NSSC, is an example of a common semi-chemical 

pulping method (yields of 75-85%). Here an initial chemical treatment is applied to wood, 

often including Na2SO3 and Na2CO3, with a slightly alkaline medium (pH 7-10). Cooking 

times are short, 0.5-2 h at 160-185°C .
[55,57]

 

Due to the amount of residual lignin in fibres, these exhibit a certain stiffness. 

Moreover, the cooking liquor deficiency in lignin, hinders the chemicals recovery process. 

Owing to that, in most cases, semi-chemical mills are integrated with chemical mills to 

allow the recovery of chemicals (from their cooking liquors), which may be used as make 

up chemicals on the chemical pulp mill. 
[55,57]

 

Although bleachable semi-chemical pulps require large amounts of bleaching 

chemicals. NSSC pulp is used mostly for the production of corrugating medium.
[55,57]

 Most 

pulping methods discussed on section 2.1.1., used for the production of pulps from wood 

are summarized in Table 2. 4.

2.2.1.4. Pulp Bleaching 

The cellulosic pulps produced by the pulping processes usually exhibits a dark color, 

namely, a brown tonality. Although this feature does not represent an issue for certain 

applications, in other cases it represents a rather significant matter. The colour displayed 

by pulp is mostly attributed to the presence of chromophore substances and residual lignin 

(compounds able to absorb light and, thus, confer colour). Therefore, to improve pulp 

brightness, pulp is treated with chemical agents able to degrade and/or remove selectively 

chromophore structures, while preserving its polysaccharides. However, bleaching also 

removes hemicellulose and extractives.
[55,63–65]

 

Bleaching processes may occur in two ways, either with the removal of lignin 

(delignification), or by preservation of lignin and degradation of some chromophore 

structures. This last is mostly applied to high yield pulps (mechanical pulps), while the 

other is applied to chemical pulps. 
[55,63–66]

 

Various chemicals may be used to improve pulps brightness. In pulp mills, bleaching 

involves a set of stages which include bleaching and alkaline extraction. Chemicals used 

on bleaching include chlorine (C), chlorine dioxide (D), sodium hypochlorite (H), oxygen 

(O), hydrogen peroxide (P), ozone (Z), and more recently enzymes (X). Sodium hydroxide 

usually functions as extraction reagent (E). 
[55,63,65,66]

 



 

~ 37 ~ 

 

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

However, due to environmental issues (production of organochloride compounds), it 

became necessary to abandon certain chemical reagents. Conventional bleaching methods 

based on chlorine and sodium hypochlorite were replaced by ClO2 or even by other 

technologies based on oxygen (O), hydrogen peroxide (P), ozone(Z) and more recently 

enzymes (X), rendering elemental chlorine-free (ECF) and totally chlorine free (TCF) 

bleaching processes. 
[55,63,65,66]

 

From all the referred agents, the use of enzymes is the newest one. In an enzymatic 

stage different enzymes may be used. An example would be the employment of xylanase. 

Its hydrolytic action towards its surrounding hemicelluloses (namely xylans) turns lignin 

vulnerable to oxidation by hydrolysis.
[55,67]

 The progress in bleaching is followed by 

measuring brightness, more specifically the reflectance of visible blue light at 457 nm (ISO 

standard norm)
[66]

 

2.2.2. Recycled pulp 

Besides virgin pulp, recycled fibres are also an important source of cellulosic pulp. 

On nowadays paper industry their presence has grown as replacements of virgin pulps. An 

example of this would be the increase of paper recycling in Europe in 2011 of 70.4%. This 

growth, overall may be attributed to various facts such as its cost (virgin fibres became 

expensive due to its limited availability), along with environmental and ecological 

concerns. Besides, the constant evolution on the deinking technology has enabled paper 

recycling processes to became, with time, more efficient and eco-friendly, relatively to 

those used to produce virgin fibres. 
[68,69]

  

As stated before, paper industry is increasing its use of recycled fibres (Figure 2. 16). 

They are majorly applied on packing products, newsprint and hygiene paper 

production.

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

2.2.2.1. Deinking 

The process of paper recycling passes through deinking. The deinking process 

consists on a sequence of different treatments, with the main purpose of removing ink and 

other impurities from fibres. 
[70,73]

 

i) Paper waste assembly 

It begins with the assembly of paper waste, the raw material used to produce recycled 

fibres. This process also includes a sorting stage, where paper wastes are sorted into 

different categories, made into bales, and transported into the paper mill, where paper 

waste will be converted into recycled pulp. The sources of paper waste consist mostly on 

Old newsprint (ONP), Old magazines (OMG), mixed office waste (MOW) and other 

higher grade papers along with old corrugated containers (OCC). The combination of all 

these operations makes it a rather expensive process. Moreover, the variability of the 

feedstock meant for recycling, may afflict variations on the deinking process.
[68,70,73]

  

The bales of waste paper received on the paper mill are then subjected to series of 

process treatments.
[70,73,74]

 Emphasis will be given to key deinking operations, namely 

pulping, floatation and washing. Even though bleaching is an optional stage aiming to 

improve recycled paper brightness, this operation will also be discussed. 

ii) Pulping and screening 

When received, papers wastes are fed to a pulper for disintegration into fibres. 

During repulping (slushing), waste paper is soaked, disintegrated, and ink and other 

impurities start to detach from fibres. If the paper waste (fibres source) exhibits rather high 

wet strength, a disperser may be used to aid fibre separation. Chemicals, temperature or 

both aid the process. Chemicals, such as sodium hydroxide, sodium silicates and EDTA 

may be used to improve fibre wetting, disintegration and impurities detachment.
[70,73,74]

 

Other contaminates such as plastic materials, metals and other types of impurities 

may also be removed on refuse removal, high-density cleaning and/or screening 

stages.
[70,73,74]

 

Screening is used to remove and minimize the aforementioned impurities as early as 

possible. In this process the impurity particles are retained by a screen and thus separated 

from the fibres. For an optimized process screens not only contain rotors and screen hole 

baskets, but also a cyclone function to separate heavy from light portions.
[70,73,74]

 

  



 

~ 39 ~ 

 

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

iii) Floatation and Washing 

The main operations used in deinking consist on flotation and washing, whose main 

objectives are the removal of ink along with other impurities.  

In the case of floatation, the hydrophobic particles made of impurities (whose major 

component are inks), coalesce into larger particles, aided by chemicals and air bubbles, 

towards the surface. Then, the formed froth is removed. This process may be influenced by 

variables such as water hardness, pH, consistency, particle size and temperatures (usually 

40-45ºC). To aid the process, chemicals such as calcium soaps are often used. These 

chemicals are named collectors, since their job consists, mostly, on promoting impurities 

agglomeration, by enhancing the chemical interaction between its particles and air bubbles. 

Other chemicals, often used on this process consist on sodium hydroxide, (pH increase, 

fibre swelling, emulsification), fatty acid soaps (collectors), and surfactants (improve ink 

detachment). 
[70,73–75]

 

Relatively to the washing process, the principles behind it are related with the 

difference in size between fibres and dirt particles. In terms of chemicals it does not differ 

much from flotation, being the main difference the use of higher amounts of surfactants 

instead of fatty acids. However, since washing removes a rather high amount of fillers, this 

process becomes rather relevant for the production of low ash pulp, which is often used for 

tissue paper production and other applications requiring such features.
[70,73]

 

The combination of floatation and washing is often observed in some mills. The 

conjugation of the different deinking processes depends strongly on the fibre source 

composition and on the end-pulp desired features. Deinking processes based on floatation 

render higher yields and higher selectivity, comparatively to washing based deinking. The 

selectivity in both may be improved by applying one or more specialty chemicals. 
[73–75]

 

In general, washing displays high efficiency removing small particles (&lt;10 ?m), 

whereas floatation exhibits better results removing medium-sized particles (10–100 ?m). 

As concerns larger impurities particles ( &gt;100 ?m), screening and centrifugal cleaners are 

used.
[73]

 These processes may occur either on alkaline or neutral environment. Alkaline 

deinking medium is widely used and considered more efficient for ink removal than 

neutral. However, it generates significant chemical oxygen demand, which is caused by the 

removal of carbohydrates and organic impurities from fibres.
[70,73]

 

iv) Bleaching 

Bleaching may be included on the deinking operations and it can be performed 

depending on the requirements desired on the end-product. It is a way to improve pulps

optical properties and add value.
[70,74]

 Similarly to other operations, previously mentioned, 

bleaching conditions also strongly depend on the used fibre source (feedstock variability). 

In this process hydrogen peroxide is often applied as bleaching agent, due to its easy 

employment and low price. Additionally, since it does not degrade and remove lignin, it 

doesn’t affect negatively neither the pulp yield (decrease) or the mill effluents (increase 

chemical oxygen demand COD, etc).
[70,73]

 

A wide variety of chemicals may be used for bleaching. Besides chlorine free 

bleaching chemicals, such as, hydrogen peroxide (previously mentioned) or sodium 

dithionite, chlorine-containing chemicals (chlorine dioxide and sodium hypochlorite) have 

been used for wood free fibres, although these last have been abandoned due to 

environmental issues (formation of organochlorine compounds).
[70,75–77]

 

In most cases the bleaching involves a two-stage process, consisting on an oxidation 

stage followed by a reduction. Even though in some cases these stages are sequential, 

overall something is added to end the oxidative action before the reductive stage starts. 

Examples of oxidative agents include hydrogen peroxide or oxygen, while the reductive 

ones are often sodium hydrosulfite and formamidine sulfinic acid (FAS). These are often 

used for bleaching and discoloration, and its use is rather relevant on fibre sources heavily 

contaminated with dyes and inks. 
[70,73,76,77]

 

The deinking operation lines comprise the combination of the techniques 

aforementioned and others, such as, screening (remove impurities), thickening (presses or 

belts used to increase pulp consistency), dispersion (detachment of contaminants and 

reduction of its particles to smaller sizes), or fine cleaning. 
[70,73,74]

 

After the deinking process, the pulp is ready to be manufactured into paper and 

related products. Some paper and board grades may be produced over recycled fibres 

exclusively. This can include corrugating medium and test liner, or newsprint. Other 

grades use blends of recycled and virgin fibres.
[73]

 

As regards recycled pulp optical features, these are of utter importance in all cases, 

with exception of dark coloured board. In other cases, such as fine papers, newsprint or 

tissue paper production, high demands are required not only in terms of brightness but also 

in terms of low impurities specks count.
[70,73]

 

Another parameter with high significance is the ash content. Depending on the pulps 

end-purpose, this parameter may be carefully controlled during deinking. An example of 

this would be the recycled pulp used for tissue paper manufacture. In this case, low ash 

content is required, not only due to process sensibility to high ash content, but also due to 

issues with end product desired features.
[70,73]

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

The presence of stickies (such as glues, adhesives, etc) are another parameter to 

consider, since their presence is often associated with recycled paper quality.
[70]

 

Besides the aforementioned, a good printability is also an important parameter as 

regards certain paper grades. Here, properties such as the fibre aptitude towards paper 

formation, fibres surface properties and papers strength are relevant. Additionally, 

properties such as water absorption and wet and dry strength are also rather essential, that 

is the case of tissue paper products.
[70]

 

2.2.2.2. Recycled fibres quality 

The expansion of recycled fibres utilization has driven a demand for a better 

comprehension about its nature and fundamental differences departing them from virgin 

fibres. As mentioned before, recycled fibres source is waste paper, whose features 

influence recycled fibres quality. Consequently, the different stages of waste fibres history, 

such as its origin or the processes they were subjected to, through its lifecycle, condition 

the produced recycled fibres properties. 
[78]

 

Cellulosic fibres can change significantly when formed in the wet web of paper and, 

subsequently, subjected to processes such as pressing, drying, printing, storage, repulping, 

and deinking. Often it is possible to replace recycled fibres by virgin ones, although their 

behaviour displays differences in terms of properties, such as lower hydration abilities, 

lower strength properties, etc. 
[69]

 

The presence of impurities is able to affect greatly recycled fibres properties. Even 

after deinking recycled fibres still exhibit significant amounts of impurities such as inks, 

glues, filler, fatty acids, etc. These affect fibres properties, such as its ability to bind and its 

hydrophilicity. However, the losses of intrinsic fibres properties (bonding ability, 

flexibility and swelling) are mostly attributed to the hornification effect. This phenomena 

limits significantly the application of recycled pulps in papermaking, especially in papers 

that require good strength properties.
[79–81]

 

2.2.2.2.1. Hornification 

Cellulosic fibres hornification consists in a series of structural changes on cellulosic 

fibres, induced, mainly, by successive swelling, pressing, and mostly drying operations. By 

subjecting fibres to such stressful conditions, rearrangements on cellulose chains occur, 

leading to the formation of irreversible hydrogen bonds between fibrils, yielding fibril 

aggregation, fibre collapse, substantial losses on fibres porosity, stiffening, inability to 

swell as originally, loss on fibre bonding capacity and, therefore, losses on mechanical and 

hydration properties. 
[79,82–84]

 



 

~ 42 ~ 

 

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

Hornification has been widely studied through the years and its consequences are of 

utter importance to pulp and paper industry, since drying and swelling are essential parts of 

the papermaking process, and the main guilty parties behind it. Besides, the on growing 

use of recycled fibres has made more and more essential a better comprehension of all the 

phenomena associated with losses on fibres quality, during its lifecycle.
[85]

  

In general, the irreversibility of the hornification effect is related with the formation 

of irreversible hydrogen bonds. Cellulose displays a high amount of free OH groups, which 

allows the formation of interfibrillar bonds through hydrogen interactions. (Figure 2. 

17).
[82,85]

  

 

Figure 2. 17 – Hydrogen bonds between cellulose fibrils. 

As results of the hydrogen bonding between external cellulose chains in fibrils, their 

aggregation takes place. Interactions between cellulose and water also play a relevant role, 

as concerns the supramolecular structure. Although not as strong as covalent bonds, due to 

high surface area and small distance between OH groups, hydrogen bonds, between 

cellulose chains, contribute significantly to the polymer supramolecular structure, which 

confer cellulosic fibres the ability to swell without dissolving in water.
[85]

  

To explain the effect of drying (major cause of hornification) Scallan
[84,86]

 proposed 

a model. In this model, an interpretation can be taken to what happens to microfibrils and 

its fibrils upon swelling, drying and re-swelling. The structure of dry cellulose consists on 

a set of microfibrils held together by hydrogen bonds, as shown in Figure 2. 18 (A). When 

in contact with water, water molecules interrupt interfibrilar hydrogen bonds, inducing 

fibrils to break apart initially into B, and further C and possibly D (Figure 2. 18). Upon 

drying fibrils return to structure A (Figure 2. 18). Although, upon re-swelling, due to 

hornification (presence of irreversible hydrogen bonds between adjacent microfibrils 

possibly formed during the drying process), fibrillar aggregation is verified, and therefore 

the microfibril structure expands less upon re-wetting, due to a lacking of free OH groups 



 

~ 43 ~ 

 

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

available for interaction. Therefore, the microfibril structure instead of expanding further, 

as in C or D will be closer to B (Figure 2. 18).
[84–86]

 

 

Figure 2. 18 – Scallan model(1977) (adapted from 
[85]

). 

The decrease of free OH groups caused by the hornification phenomena, has been 

investigated in the past 
[32–34]

. It was demonstrated that the decrease of free OH groups, 

upon drying (cause of hornification), always leads to the decrease of accessibility.
[85]

 As 

previously mentioned, hornification may be promoted/stimulated during certain process 

operations, such as pressing, drying, calendaring, printing, deinking, etc). During this 

operations, favourable conditions are gathered prompting the occurrence of 

hornification.
[79,87]

 

Factors affecting hornification 

i) Drying process 

In pulp production and paper making the process of water removal from cellulosic 

fibres includes operations such as wet pressing, air drying or oven drying. High 

temperatures allow a rapid evaporation and thus removal of water molecules from fibres, 

which promotes structural rearrangements (different predisposition of fibrils) and the 

formation of irreversible hydrogen bonds, typical of hornification. The aggregation of 

fibrils and lower accessibility to free OH groups constitutes hornified fibres. Therefore, it 

is of general agreement that fibres hornification is highly affected by drying. Regardless of 

high temperatures effect, the water removal also contributes largely to fibres 

hornification.
[82,85]

 

ii) Water amount in pulps 

Water loss during drying also affects fibres hornification. When fibres are in contact 

with water structural changes are verified, and since water molecules disrupt bonds 



 

~ 44 ~ 

 

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

between cellulose molecules, its mobility becomes less difficult, since there are less bonds 

holding them together. Small amounts of water (ca. 10-20 %w/w) allows to maintain the 

fibrils relatively disaggregated.The deep dehydration of pulp (less than 5%w/w residual 

water), leads to strong intermolecular interaction and fibrils aggregation. These changes 

are irreversible, because upon drying and re-wetting, pulps properties (hydration abilities 

and strength properties) differ from those from the beginning. Therefore, the formation of 

irreversible hydrogen bonds is promoted by exhaustive removal of water, bringing the 

aforementioned changes on fibres properties.
[82,85]

  

iii) Fibres chemistry 

Fibres composition plays an essential role on inter- and intra-fibre bondings which 

determine papers strength properties. Chemical (low yield) and mechanical (high yield) 

pulps differ from one another in terms of its fibres chemistry. While in the first most lignin 

was removed accompanied by some hemicelluloses (chemical process), in the latter most 

of its lignin matrix and hemicelluloses are kept (high yield).  

In high yield pulps, the presence of high lignin and hemicelluloses contents benefits 

fibres, since these compounds act as barrier and protect cellulose-cellulose hydrogen 

bonds. By preventing the formation of irreversible hydrogen bonds, these compounds 

protect fibres from the hornification effect, being thus less prone to it.
[79,81,84,85]

 

On the other hand, chemical pulps exhibit a high exposure of its OH groups (higher 

accessibility to free OH groups), due to the removal of lignin along with some 

hemicelluloses. This turns chemical pulps prone towards rearrangements, to the formation 

of irreversible hydrogen bonds and aggregation. Being susceptible to hornification, these 

pulps suffer losses on its fibres properties as result of hornification (e.g. hydration 

properties and strength properties). 
[79,81,84,85]

 

2.2.2.3. Treatments to improve recycled fibres 

Recycled fibres suffer severe losses on their properties during their lifecycle, being 

only able to be recycled at most 3-5 times. However, these losses can be attenuated by a 

wide range of treatments. These treatments include mechanical (refining), chemical (such 

as alkaline solutions) and even biological treatments (enzymes). Alternative hypotheses 

include the mixture of virgin fibres with recycled fibres, or recycled fibres fractionation. 

Nevertheless, refining and alkaline treatment are the most common methods applied to 

improve recycled fibres properties. 
[78,79,81,87]

 

 



 

~ 45 ~ 

 

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

i) Refining 

Fibre properties may be changed through a mechanical treatment widely used on 

papermaking, refining. Its main purpose is to further defibrillate fibres, which were 

collapsed with aggregated fibrils, and, thus, with less bonding potential due to 

hornification. The defibrillation produced by refining is expected to improve fibres 

accessibility, fibre bonding potential and thus its hydration and strength properties, which 

were compromised due to hornification. 
[78,79,81,87]

  

Although refining poses a good alternative to regain recycled fibres properties, it also 

causes fibres shorting, further fines creation and therefore lower freeness. Therefore, when 

refining recycled fibres it is important to bear in mind that during its history, recovered 

fibres have already suffered refining and that recycled pulp has fibres that may be more 

prone to fragmentation. Thus, refining parameters should be carefully controlled, in order 

to decrease, as much as possible, the negative effects coming from its use. To attenuate 

such effects, low intensity refining or high consistency refining may be used.
[79,81,87,88]

 

ii) Blending  

Recycled fibres properties can also be upgraded by blending with other fibres, such 

as virgin fibres. Due to recycled fibres low bonding ability, stiffness and thus frailer 

mechanical properties, virgin fibres, in a certain proportion, are blended with recycled 

fibres. Virgin fibres do not exhibit low bonding ability like hornified fibres, thus they 

confer to the blend higher bonding ability, yielding stronger fibres network and thus 

strength properties. This is especially true when it comes to blending with refined virgin 

fibres. 
[78,79,87]

 

iii) Fractionation 

The technique of fractionation mostly applied during the paper recycling process, is 

used as a way to upgrade recycled fibres performance. It does not reverse the effect of 

hornification on recycled fibres properties, but, since it separates different types of fibres in 

the recycling process, it attenuates the losses in terms of its papermaking properties. 

[78,79,81,87]
 

Fractionation improves pulp quality and allows a better control of pulp and paper 

characteristics by redistributing its fines and ash. Usually it is easy to find utility for the 

long fibre fraction, although the same is not exact when it comes to the short fibres fraction 

and stickies.
[78,79,81]

 

  



 

~ 46 ~ 

 

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

iv) Chemical treatments 

Different approaches may be followed; i.e. chemical treatments may be applied 

either with the intension of preventing hornification or to improve fibres properties 

degraded by hornification. 
[79,81,87]

 

An example of prevention treatments includes the chemical modification of 

cellulosic fibres, before papermaking, by partial substitution of cellulose OH groups. These 

methods aim to avert the formation of the irreversible hydrogen bonds, characteristic from 

hornification. These methods consist, in most cases, on cellulose derivatization which 

includes methylation, acetylation or even carboxymethylation reactions. 
[79,87]

 

Chemical additives may also be added as a way, not to prevent, but to 

improve/reverse hornification. Alkaline solutions are a rather popular treatment in 

papermaking to improve recycled fibres properties. After refining is the second most 

reliable method to retrieve recycled fibres properties. The treatment of recovered fibres 

with sodium hydroxide (high pH conditions) aims, mostly, to improve fibres swelling, 

freeness and its strength properties. It has demonstrated better results, in some cases, than 

even refining, however, in the next recycling cycle fibres will be more affected by 

hornification. Alkaline treatment may be conjugated with refining to further improve 

recycled fibres properties.
[79,81,88]

 

v) Enzymatic treatment 

In the last decades, the use of enzymes on paper recycling processes has 

demonstrated great potential as an environmentally friendly addition for the deinking 

process. The use of enzymes during paper recycling aids not only impurities removal and 

bleaching, but also improving recycled fibres drainability and strength properties. 
[81,89,90]

 

 Enzymes action during deinking generally occurs either by attacking the 

ink/impurities or the fibre surface on the fibre-ink interface. Enzymes can be used 

separately or in conjunction, to optimize the deinking process. Pectinases, hemicellulases, 

cellulases and other ligninolytic enzymes act on the fibre surface or bonds close to the ink 

particles, freeing the ink for removal. Lipases and esterases act by degrading inks based on 

vegetable oils. 

Ligninolytic enzymes action, besides removing impurities, also may improves fibres 

strength properties (higher bonding ability) and drainability.
[81,89–91]

 

 Cellulases are widely used to facilitate the deinking of waste paper. Its action peels 

fibres, which, besides aiding impurities removal, also improves fibres bonding ability 

(fibre are more fibrillated) and its freeness (fines degradation). Cellulases may also be used 



 

~ 47 ~ 

 

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

in conjunction with hemicellulases. Hemicellulases may also be used alone without 

cellulases. An example of a widely used enzyme on pulps biobleaching is xylanase. 

Additionally, this enzyme, due to its ligninolytic nature, may modify fibres to be with 

properties near those of slightly beaten. 
[90–93]

 

Enzymes represent thus a great opportunity to improve recycled fibres quality and 

turn more efficient the paper recycling process. By applying the appropriate enzyme 

cocktail, under optimum conditions, it is possible to improve deinking, drainability, 

stickies control and “refine” pulp (energy savings). 
[81,90,94]

 

2.3. Paper products - Tissue papers 

Pulp is used as main source to produce a great variety of products with numerous 

applications. Examples of products manufactured from pulp include office paper, 

newspapers, magazines, books, packing products, tissue paper, etc.
[54]

 Despite the huge 

variety of pulp end uses this work will only be focused on tissue paper manufacture.  

Tissue paper consists on a low weight creped paper, widely used by society for 

domestic, sanitary and industrial purposes. Tissue is often made in weight ranging from 8-

50g/m
2 

with a porous elastic structure, with a good absorption ability and high softness. It 

can be made from both virgin and recycled fibres, as mentioned on the previous sections, 

and used to produce a wide diversity of products such as toilet paper, facial tissue paper, 

paper towels, napkins, etc.
[95,96]

 

2.3.1. Tissue paper production 

Tissue paper is usually produced by a mixture of hardwood and softwood pulps; 

whose proportion depends from paper mill to paper mill. Recycled pulp is normally used to 

produce recycled based tissue products, but essentially in conjugation with virgin fibres. 

[95,96]
 

General paper production process consists of the following stages. Initially, stock is 

prepared by dispersing pulp in water and additives. Pulp suspension is then supplied on a 

former section, where water is removed by gravity or vacuum. Afterwards the wet paper 

web enters the press section where further water is removed mechanically (dry solid 

content of 33-55% depending on the type of paper). The remaining water is removed by 

drying, on a drying section, which could be done by one or more stages depending on the 

paper grade.
[97]

 



 

~ 48 ~ 

 

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

Even though the principles behind paper machines are much alike they still exhibit 

differences in terms of individual components, which is related with the type of paper 

produced.
[96–98]

 

In tissue paper production the sheet formation process in many cases still consists on 

a fourdrinier wet-end, which entails many operations such as stock delivery, sheet 

formation, water removal, low vacuum and high vacuum. Other technologies include gap 

formers or crescent formers. For example, in a conventional tissue machine the paper web 

is formed in a gap former, transferred by the felt to the dryer section, where first is pressed 

and mechanically dewatered by a shoe press acting against the tissue cylinder.
[98,99]

 

In the drying section, two types of processes may be encountered. In conventional 

wet press process (CWP), the dryer section includes a Yankee dryer section, which is the 

most traditional drying technology. Although in recent years the through air drying, TAD, 

technology arose as an alternative. 
[96,98,100]

 

In the typical CWP process the paper web is formed, then transferred to a felt and 

dewatered by pressing against the Yankee dryer. The pressing allows the paper web to be 

transferred into the Yankee dryer surface, where an adhesive was sprayed prior to the sheet 

formation to provide good adhesion between the paper sheet and the Yankee dryer surface. 

The Yankee dryer consists on an iron cylinder (Yankee cylinder) with a diameter of 5-7m, 

heated with steam from the inside, to dry the paper web passing at high speeds outside. The 

paper web is dried and is then removed by a steel blade, “the blade doctor”, which 

produces a creped elastic sheet. The creping process is controlled by the strength of the 

adhesive on the Yankee cylinder, the geometry of creping blade, the speed difference 

between the Yankee and the final section of the paper machine and pulp features. 
[95,96,100]

 

The creping process decreases sheet density, increases strength, and thus softness 

along with good absorbency features, which are typical on tissue paper products. After 

creping, the paper sheet obtained is subsequently made into tissue products. 
[100]

 

The TAD process consists on another drying process, which is used to produce extra 

soft and absorbent tissue paper. In this process the paper web is dewatered and pre-dried, 

without mechanical pressing, which preserves bulk. Hence, the paper web is formed and 

then transferred to the porous TAD-cylinder, in this case, into the TAD-wire, where the 

paper web is dried by blowing hot air through the paper sheet and the felt. This creates on 

the paper sheet high and low weight regions and high and low density regions, dispersed 

through the fibres network. After a pre-drying TAD process the paper sheets may be 

subjected to a Yankee dryer and creping, for higher strength, softness and absorbency. 



 

~ 49 ~ 

 

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

Even though tissue made from TAD is uncreped it is useful in some applications, creping 

is mostly commonly used for towel and tissue grades, particularly premium grades. 
[98,100]

 

Even though TAD has become rather popular due to its higher absorbency, softness 

and bulk papers, the process requires the consumption of tremendous amounts of energy 

(twice the energy of conventional drying process). In Figure 2. 19 it is possible to observe 

the illustration of a conventional tissue paper machine, while on Figure 2. 20 it is 

represented a tissue paper machine with TAD process.
[95,96]

2.4. Additives – Product differentiation 

In tissue paper products aesthetic, tactile and absorbency properties are given major 

relevance by consumers. Products appearance is rather relevant, however its tactile 

perception, i.e. softness, and water absorption capacity are yet fundamental features to the 

consumer’s eyes. These properties may be adjusted by process variables, or improved 

further by the addition of additives. 
[100,101]

 

Additives may be applied to either improve already existing paper properties, such as 

its hydrophilicity or softness, or to confer new differentiating features. This is the case of 

additives able to confer features such as colour, odour or even antimicrobial properties. 

These new features, besides allowing tissue paper to differentiate from conventional tissue 

paper products, turns them more appealing and special towards consumers. Examples of 

additives applied to achieve the aforementioned properties include humectants (improve 

hydrophilicity and softness), dyes (confer colour), antimicrobial agents (antimicrobial 

properties) or even perfumes (pleasant odour). 
[102,103]

 

 



 

~ 50 ~ 

 

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

2.4.1. Humectants 

Due to cellulosic fibres high affinity for water, paper is used to manufacture a wide 

variety of absorbent products. As mentioned in previous sections, cellulose is able to 

interact with water and form hydrogen bonds. However, the amount of water that cellulosic 

fibres are able to absorbs varies and is influenced by cellulose accessibility (as previously 

mentioned) and thus by fibres porosity or even its composition. 

In tissue manufacture to improve papers water absorption capacity, changes on the 

process may be applied. As early mentioned, TAD drying and creping operations influence 

greatly tissue paper absorbency. For example, creping plays a key role on tissue paper 

water absorption. The process induces crinkles on tissue paper, which breaks many 

interfibre bonds, which were previously formed during drying. This operation changes 

tissue paper topography, which results on much higher surface area and thus more sites 

available for interaction with water. Additionally it also turns tissue paper softer.
[96,98,100]

 

Besides mechanical operations, in tissue and other hygienic and cosmetic products, 

chemical additives, otherwise denominated as wetting agents, humectants or moisturizers 

may be added to further improve both water retention/absorption and softness properties. 

[104,105]
 

In products such as cosmetics or food packing its composition often includes 

humectants. Humectants attract and hold on to water. Thus these materials are applied, in a 

wide variety of products, either to retard water loss or to increase its uptake. This task is 

usually performed by substances of hygroscopic nature. Example of humectants often used 

on cosmetic products include pyrrodilone carboxylic acid, urea, panthenol, butylene glycol, 

propylene glycol, glycerine, polyethylene glycol, and other inorganic ions.
[106–108]

 

Humectants can be divided into three groups, inorganic, metal-organic and organic. 

Both metal-organic and organic humectants are frequently applied on the manufacture of 

hygiene and cosmetic products, while the same is not valid for inorganic humectants. 
[108]

 

i) Inorganic humectants 

Inorganic humectants consist on salts of inorganic acids. Calcium chloride is an 

example. These type of humectants find little use on personal care products due to 

problems related not only with its corrosive action, but also with problems such as 

destabilization of emulsions in creams, decreasing foam, etc. 
[108]

 

  



 

~ 51 ~ 

 

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

ii) Metal-Organic Humectants 

Metal organic humectants, as denoted by its designation consist on a mixture of a 

metal ions and an organic counterpart. These humectants are rather useful and include 

compounds such as sodium lactate or sodium PCA (pyrrolidone carboxylic acid). 
[106,108]

 

iii) Organic Humectants 

Organic humectants are extensively used in the cosmetic industry. This class of 

compounds includes glycerol, ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol (PEG), propylene 

glycol, glycerine, urea, sorbitol, etc. Their strength as humectants depends strongly on their 

ratio of OH to carbons, hence increasing ratio increasing hygroscopy. 
[106,108]

 

The changes produced on a material hydrophilicity by the addition of hygroscopic 

agents, namely on paper products can be accessed by many tests. In case of tissue paper 

this analysis can be performed considering ISO 12625-8:2010 (Tissue paper and tissue 

products - Part 8: Water-absorption time and water-absorption capacity, basket-immersion 

test method) and ISO 8787:1986 (Paper and board - Determination of capillary rise - 

Klemm method). The first test is extensively used on tissue paper industry and it allowed 

to determine the quantity of water a certain amount of paper is able to absorb, along with 

the time of absorption. As regards ISO 8787:1986, its used has been abandoned through 

the years by replacement with ISO 12625-8:2010. 

A material hydrophilicity may also be accessed through contact angle analysis. 

Although not common for tissue paper this analysis is widely used to investigate materials 

wettability. 

2.4.2. Dyes 

Colour of objects (e.g. paper) is only possible due to the interaction of light with 

matter. When light is shone upon it, part of that light will be absorbed, while the other will 

be reflected. It is this light, the reflected part that will enter human eye and send a signal, 

which the brain interprets as colour. Humans are only perceptive towards a small portion 

of the electromagnetic spectrum, the visible region, between 400 and 700 nm. 
[109,110]

  

It is of common understanding, that when light is completely reflected, to our eyes 

the colour appears white, whereas if all is absorbed it appears black. Additionally, when 

light is reflected throughout the whole visible spectre the object appears grey. 

Nevertheless, if light is partially absorbed, as in a short wavelength range (e.g. 435-480nm, 

blue light), then chromatic colour appears (in this case yellow). In Table 2. 5 it is possible 

to observe the different regions of the visible spectrum, the colour of light at that specific 

wavelength band and the shade which will absorb that particular wavelength. All shades 



 

~ 52 ~ 

 

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

can be represented by a reflectance spectra, which works much like a fingerprint. 
[109,111]

 

Table 2. 5 – Wavelengths of light and the colour it absorbs.

560-580 Greenish yellow Violet 

580-595 Yellow Blue 

595-605 Orange Greenish blue 

605-700 Red Bluish green 

To convey colour to paper, cellulosic fibres are treated with dyes. The selection of 

the most appropriate dye to impregnate cellulosic fibres depends, mostly, on the end-

products purposes, its desired physic-chemical properties, its features or manipulation. 

Overall, dyeing is expected to confer paper a specific shade or tonality .
[110]

  

There is a wide variety of dyes able to absorb light at different wavelengths and 

therefore bestow different colours to paper products. Dyes can be classified according with 

its chemical structure (e.g. azo, anthraquinones, etc) or its application method, the 

classification by colour index (acid, basic, direct dyes, etc). The former classification is 

commonly used by the dye chemists, while the latter is mostly used by the dye users. 

[111,112]
 Even though being quite common, both classification may be mixed together to 

designate a dye (for example, direct azo dye or anthraquinone acid dyes).
[111,113]

 However, 

here it will only be introduced the colour index classification, which is the most common 

among its users, such as the paper industry.  

2.4.2.1. Colour Index classification 

The colour index classification, i.e. dye classification according with its use or 

method of application, may be advantageous on the eye of users, relatively to classification 

by chemical structure. In this system of classification, dyes are divided into groups such as 

basic dyes, acid dyes, direct dyes, sulfur dyes, pigments, reactive dyes, vat dyes, disperse 

dyes, mordant dyes, etc. Although, in paper industry, the most common are direct dyes 

(Figure 2. 21).

Figure 2. 21 – Relevance of the different classes of dyes in 2004 (adapted from[110]). 

i) Basic Dyes (Cationic dyes) 

Basic or cationic dyes consist mostly on salts (chlorides, hydrochlorides, sulfates, 

and oxalates) of colour bases.
[109,110,113]

 Some of older basic dyes consisted on di- and 

triphenylmethane, heterocyclic azine, oxazine or polymethine, or aminoazo 

compounds.
[114]

 These dyes are not water soluble and sometimes require de addition of 

acid, to produce dye solutions. Acetic acid is often used on these formulations. 
[109,110]

 

Basic dyes are frequently employed on the coloration of materials with anionic nature, 

where strong electrostatic attractions may be established. Examples of such materials 

include protein fibres (e.g. wool, silk and leather), synthetic polyamides (such as nylon) 

and pulp containing lignin (e.g. unbleached pulp or ground wood). Additionally, these dyes 

(high cationic charge) also exhibit a high attraction towards fillers. 
[110,111,114]

 Conversely, 

bleached pulps affinity with basic dyes is very poor, and for that reason these dyes are 

often not considered suitable for these materials coloration. 
[111]

 Even though its use is 

decreasing on paper industry, these dyes are still used on the production of packing papers 

(liner, testliner, corrugating medium), or wood-containing printing/writing papers.
[109,110]

 

To improve dye fixation anionic fixatives may be added (for example, sodium salts 

of condensation of formaldehyde, naphthalene sulfonic acid). The use of fixatives is 

usually related with bleached pulps dyeing, which contain very low amounts of lignin. 

They allow an enhanced dye fixation, richer colours, along with improved bleedfastness. 

Moreover, since dye fixation is more efficient, effluents become less stained.
[110]

 

Basic dyes usually exhibit brilliant colour and advantageous dyeing costs. They also 

display good fastness to water and steam on lignin containing materials (due to their good 

fixation on these materials). 
[109,110]

 However, despite the referred benefits, the 

disadvantages associated with its use include the already mentioned poor affinity towards

bleached materials, mottling tendency (which affects the uniformity of the dyed material) 

and poor light fastness. Many of these dyes are becoming obsolete, but a few are still used 

for dyeing paper, leather and for inks manufacture. 
[109,114]

 

ii) Acid Dyes (Anionic dyes) 

Acid dyes or anionic dyes are water-soluble salts of organic acids (often potassium or 

sodium salts). Most acid dyes are azo dyes and are quite similar to direct dyes. They 

contain one or more water-solubilising anionic groups, mostly sulfonic acid groups of 

sodium salts. When in water they dissociate into coloured anions. 
[110–112,115]

 

Although basic dyes exhibit high solubility, more sulfonic acid groups on their 

structure (meant to improve solubility) may cost these dye’s affinity and/or substantivity 

for their substrates, yielding thus poor bleed fastness or coloured effluents. An example 

would be its poor affinity towards cellulosic fibres. Even though acid dyes are able to 

diffuse inside fibres, the use of fixatives is required (often aluminium sulfate and cationic 

fixative agents, such as condensation products of dicyandiamide with formaldehyde, 

polyamines, polyvinylamines). 
[109–111]

 Since cellulose is anionic in aqueous medium, dyes 

may be only attracted by means of hydrogen bonding or through Van der Waals forces. To 

prompt that situation, it is rather important that dye molecules approach very closely 

cellulose molecules, for what dye molecules linearity and/or planarity is essential. 
[111]

 

These dyes are of limited use in paper industry and are mainly applied on textile 

fibres with cationic character, such as protein fibres (wool, silk and leather) or synthetic 

polyamides (nylon). 
[111]

 

Further disadvantages include strongly coloured effluents and poor bleed fastness. 

Advantages of acid dyes are their solubility, no tendency to mottle on stock mixtures, and 

its suitability for dip and surface dyeing. Acid dyes are mainly used for certain types of 

paper, decorative crepe paper, and carbon paper. The importance of acid dyes for paper 

dyeing has decreased greatly not only due to its poor cost/performance ratio but also due to 

the aforementioned effluents issues. 
[109–111]

 

iii) Direct Dyes 

In paper industry, direct dyes otherwise known as substantive dyes, are the most 

important and extensively used dyeing materials. These dyes are divided into cationic and 

anionic, as demonstrated by Figure 2. 21. 
[110,111]

 As the name suggests, substantivity (the 

ability to absorb onto fibres from an aqueous medium) is here an essential requirement, 

along with affinity (the ability to become bound to the fibre). 
[111,116]

 



 

~ 55 ~ 

 

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

Anionic direct dyes  

From all direct dyes, anionic dyes are the far most widely used on tissue paper 

production, and on printing/writing paper production. These dyes are quite similar to acid 

dyes and their structure includes groups responsible for enhancing water solubility, mostly 

–SO3. Due to their larger, linear and/or planar molecular structure they have a higher 

substantivity and affinity towards cellulose, relatively to acid dyes. 
[109–111]

 

Most anionic direct dyes are polyazo dyes, with structures consisting, mainly, on 

azobenzene, naphthalene, biphenyl, stilbene and aromatic heterocycles. Another group are 

copper phthalocyanines. Due to these molecules structure, it becomes easier to get closer to 

cellulose molecules and interact with then (through hydrogen bonds, Van der Waals forces, 

and/or hydrophobic interactions). They exhibit good affinity towards bleached chemical 

pulps and they may be applied over a wide pH range, yielding good fastness properties. 

[110,111]
 

Fixatives or fixing agents are added to achieve deep shades with good bleed fastness 

(e.g. deeply coloured napkins). Inside the fibre, the cationic compounds precipitate the 

anionic dyes, still in solution, by forming with dyes higher molecular mass aggregates, 

with lower solubility, which causes its precipitation inside fibres. Therefore, dye removal 

becomes more difficult. These additives consist mainly on quaternary ammonium 

compounds and cationic formaldehyde condensation resins. These dyes are not suitable to 

wood containing feedstocks, since wood components prevent a uniform dyeing process. Its 

lightfastness is usually good, but the colour attained may not be as brilliant as that on acid 

and basic dyes. 
[110,116]

 

Cationic direct dyes 

Cationic direct dyes, alike anionic direct dyes, display a planar molecular structure, 

but with cationic groups. The cationic charge, when compared with anionic charge (water 

solubility and repulsive forces), allows an improved attraction between fibres and dye 

molecules, and thus an excellent dye fixation. Due to the anionic character of cellulose in 

water, a cationic dye can form strong electrostatic interactions besides the usual weaker 

hydrogen bonds, or Van der Waals’. 
[109–111]

 

There are many types of cationic groups besides quaternary ammonium groups. 

These dyes molecules may contain pyridinium pyridine, thiazolium, benzthiazonlium, 

indolium and triazolium cationic groups. 
[109–111]

 



 

~ 56 ~ 

 

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

Conversely, the presence of positive charges does not favour the dyeing process of 

mechanical fibres. When this is not the case, these dyes originate good bleedfastness and 

their combination with anionic direct dyes may be used to enhance dye fixation.
[109,110]

 

iv) Other dyes 

Other classes of dyes include sulfur dyes, pigments, reactive dyes, vat dyes, 

disperse dyes, mordant dyes, etc. While the first two are still applied to cellulosic fibres to 

a small extent, the others find little or no use in paper industry. Although they may be 

applied to cotton or other fibres (wool, silk, etc) coloration on textile industry. 
[110,111,113]

  

2.4.2.2. Influences on the dyeing process 

The dyeing process can be influenced by many aspects, such as the fibres chemical 

composition, dyes substantivity and affinity towards cellulosic fibres, type of forces 

established between dyes and fibres, process conditions (e.g. temperature, agitation, pH, 

and others), etc. 
[111]

 

As previously referred the feedstock composition can influence fibres dying process, 

since different types of pulp (bleached or mechanical pulps) display different affinities 

towards the same dye. This sensibility towards stock variations, may create issues as 

concerns the dye fixation, which often requires the use of chemical additives, such as 

fixatives to settle these setbacks. Moreover, pulp refining also influences fibres dying. If 

fibres were previously refined shade variations may occur, since beaten and fibrillated 

fibres are more accessible towards dyes relatively to unbeaten ones.
[109,111,117]

 

Other process conditioning parameters include pulp consistency (could originate non 

uniform coloration), water hardness (helps reducing repulsive forces between fibres and 

dyes), fillers content (consumes dyes and gives weaker depths of colour), fixatives 

(cationic products added to aid dye fixation), and moist content (certain dyes are affected 

by moisture yielding changes in shade). The order of additives addition (dye, fixatives, etc) 

also plays a rather relevant role on the dyeing process, being able to affect greatly the dye 

fixation, the products colour uniformity, etc.
[109,111,117]

 

The type of dyes selected may also influence the process. Its substantivity and 

affinity play a key role on the process. Substantivity consists on the ability of the dye to be 

absorbed by cellulose fibres from an aqueous medium, while affinity is the capacity of the 

dye to be bound to the fibre. Therefore, if a dye possesses high substantivity, due to low 

affinity it may exhibit poor fastness. Similarly, a dye with low substantivity and high 

affinity will create coloured effluents, but good fastness properties. It is thus essential, 



 

~ 57 ~ 

 

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

during dye selection, to look for dyes with both high substantivity and affinity for fibres, 

for a more efficient process. 
[111]

 

The interactions existing between dye and fibres also affect dye fixation and fastness 

properties. Generally, the dyeing process starts with the dye migration towards the fibres 

interface followed by its adsorption. Then the dye molecules diffuse from the surface into 

the fibres interior. Afterwards, dye molecules are fixed to fibres, either by hydrogen bonds, 

covalent bonds, or other type of physical interactions, depending on the type of dye and 

other materials involved on the dyeing process. 
[113]

 

This process may also be conditioned by electro-potential forces, temperature and 

agitation. When immersed on water or aqueous solution every fibre exhibits a certain 

electric potential, usually designated as zeta potential. For example, cellulose, exhibits 

negative charge when immerse in neutral solution. Given the case of acid dyes or even 

anionic direct dyes, in solution, these are negatively charged. Therefore, they will be 

repelled by the opposite charge, such as the case of cellulosic fibres. On the other hand, 

being the substrate wool (proteins), under its isoelectric point, it displays positive charge, 

therefore this substrate will be attracted towards negatively charges dye molecules. 
[113,118]

 

When there is a mutual repulsion between the fibre and dye, higher times are 

required before the inherent vibration to the molecules in solution have brought them near 

enough cellulosic fibres. The problem, therefore, is to accelerate the migration to the 

surface of the fibre. This may be achieved by increasing temperature, which promotes 

vibrational activity, and also by the addition of electrolytes that counteract the effect of the 

negative zeta potential. 
[113]

  

The effect of agitation is only apparent, when the amount of dye in the solution is 

limited. Under such conditions the diffusion into the fibre could be quicker than the 

assembly at the surface and agitation will then become a significant factor. The rate of 

diffusion into the fibre is obviously dependent upon the concentration of dye in the 

interfacial layer, this can under certain conditions be influenced by the degree of agitation. 

[113]
 

2.4.2.3. Colour evaluation 

To attain a certain shade, one or more dyes (mixture) may be used. Liquid or 

powder dyes are stored and them pumped (dye dilution is often required) automatically 

into the stock. Afterwards, the colour of the produced papers is analysed by a colorimeter 

or a spectrophotometer to evaluate if the produced shade agrees with the desired one. If not 



 

~ 58 ~ 

 

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

adjustments on process variables have to be performed.
[111]

 The colour evaluation is often 

performed by analysis of samples colour space coordinates and K/S values. 

i) CIE L*a*b colour space coordinates 

Human eye is not able to quantify colour accurately, thus colour measurement is 

essential for matching coloured samples, determining colour differences and adjust dyeing 

parameters. Understanding the fundamentals of colour measurement, or colorimetry, is 

essential for the optimum use of this technology.
[119]

 

Space colour coordinates are used as a way to express colour. CIE “Commission 

Internationale de L’Eclairage” (light and colour science authority) has defined three colour 

space types, CIE XYZ, CIE L*C*h and CIE L*a*b*. Being this last the most extensively 

used. 
[109,119]

 

In CIE L*a*b space coordinates every colour is described by three coordinates L*, 

a* and b*. L* represents the samples lightness/darkness, while a* represents the degree of 

red/green, where +a* implies a redder colouration and –a* a greener colouration. As 

concerns b*, this last represents the degree of yellow/blue where +b* is indicative of a 

yellower colouration whilst –b* indicates a bluer one. 
[109,119]

 

Considering the abovementioned coordinates system, it is possible to perceive that 

neutral shades (whites, greys blacks) will be positioned near the L axis, although not all 

white papers imply L*=100 neither black paper imply L=0. 
[109,119]

When a certain colour 

such as red or yellow is added, it possible that L* will be reduced (since the amount of 

light reflected is lower) and a* and b* coordinates will vary accordingly with the added 

colour. For example, if red is added, a* will increase (+a*), while blue will originate a 

development of –b*.
[109,119]

 

Simplistically, if a red colour is added, this will result in an increase in the +a* value, 

whilst a blue colour will result in an increase in the –b* value. 
[109,119]

Figure 2. 23 - Schematic explanation of the model. 
[109]

 

To analyse the produced shade of colour with the desired one the colour coordinates 

are used to determine the colour differences, which are defined by the absolute difference 

between the samples and a reference sample. For each coordinate this difference is named 

delta (?), as may be either negative or positive. The ?L* parameter represents the 

difference as regards coordinate L*, which suggests if the samples are lighter (positive) or 

darker (negative), relatively to the reference. On the other hand, ?a* describes the 

difference between red and green, i.e. if the samples are redder (positive) or greener 

(negative), while ?b* defines if the samples are yellower (positive) or bluer (negative). 

[109,119,120]
 

The total colour difference between all three coordinates is named ?E*. The 

determination of colour difference is usually derived through the CIELab 1976 equation 

(Equation 2.15).
[109,119,120]

?
= ?(???)2 + (???)2 + (???)2  Equation 2. 15 

It is possible to establish a connection between ?E and the human eye. This 

correlation is represented in Table 2. 6, where ?E values are related with a standard 

observer perceptions.

ii) Kubelka-Munk model 

Colour may also be analysed quantitatively. For opaque materials Kubelka-Munk 

equation
[121]

 correlates a sample’s spectral reflectance (R%), its absorption (K) and its 

scattering (S) features. Kubelka-Munk relationship is given by Equation 2.16, where K is 

the coefficient of absorption, S the coefficient of scatter and R the reflectance of the sample 

at a given wavelength. To a first approximation K and S are proportional to the 

concentration of each dye in the substrate.
[119,122–124]

 

? ?? =
(1??)2

2?
   Equation 2. 16 

This relationship is rather useful when formulating colours on textile, coatings and 

paper industry. In these cases, it is presumed that the scattering (S) of a dye depends on the 

properties of the substance, whereas absorption (K) of light depends on the properties of 

the dye. The value of K/S is considered to have a proportional relationship relatively to dye 

concentration (C) on the material (equation 2.17).
[123,125]

 

? ?? ? ? ?   Equation 2. 17 

This assumption is considered when intended to relate a materials appearance with 

the kind and amounts of dyes in it. This parameter plays an essential role on products 

colour formulation. The colour yield of dyeing is the depth of colour that a unit mass of 

dye is able to impart to the dyed substrate. It can be assessed visually, but a more 

quantitative measurement is possible using the Kubelka–Munk K/S.
[122,124,125]

 

2.4.3. Antimicrobial agents 

Consumers concerns and thus demand for antimicrobial products, as a way to contain 

microorganism’s contamination has driven the development of new differentiated products, 

with antimicrobial features. 
[126,127]

 An example would be the case of tissue papers, namely 

Cascade’s new antimicrobial tissue paper.
[128,129]

  

Tissue papers being made of natural fibres (cellulose) are susceptible to 

microorganism’s life and growth, however the use of antimicrobial agents is a way to 

prevent its growth and propagation, which may result in sanitary issues or harm human 

health. 
[126,127]

 

Antimicrobials may differ in terms of chemical structure, effectiveness, method of 

application, influence on people and on the environment, as well as on cost.
[126,127,130]

 

To obtain an effective action, an ideal antimicrobial treatment should meet a few 

requirements, such as being effective against a broad spectrum of bacterial and fungal 

species, but also, at the same time, display low toxicity to consumers. It should also be 

durable (be active for a long period of time). It must also be compatible with the chemical 



 

~ 61 ~ 

 

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

processes, in which it will be included, be cost effective and not be harmful to either the 

manufacturer or the environment. 
[131,132]

 

Antimicrobial agents either inhibit the growth (-static) or kill (-cidal) the 

microorganisms. For example, antimicrobial agents used in commercial textiles, e.g. silver 

nanoparticles, triclosan, polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) and quaternary ammonium 

compounds, are biocides. They act either by damaging microorganisms cell wall or alter 

cell membrane permeability, denature proteins, inhibit enzyme activity or inhibit lipid 

synthesis, all of which are essential for cell survival.
[130,131,133–136]

 

Antimicrobial agents are already employed in many different areas and materials. 

They are used as food preservatives, disinfectants, swimming pool sanitizers or in wound 

dressings. Although these agents exhibit a powerful bactericidal activity, their attachment 

to fibres (such as cellulosic fibres) may reduce its activity and limit its availability. For 

these reasons, higher amounts of these compound need to be applied to control bacterial 

growth and to preserve the antimicrobial activity for longer periods.
[126,131,137]

 

Some antimicrobials investigated or used on textile industry, the closest to the tissue 

industry, include quaternary ammonium compounds, N-halamines, chitosan, halogenated 

phenols (well-known triclosan), polybiguanides, nanoparticles of noble metals and metal 

oxides, and plant based antimicrobial agents (e.g. polyphenols, essential oils, etc).
[131,138–

140]
 Despite the wide variety of possibilities, only PHMB will be further discussed, because 

it was used in the present work. 

2.4.3.1. Polybiguanides 

Polybiguanides, are an example of effective antimicrobial agents, which consist on 

polymeric polycationic amines, with cationic biguanide repeating units separated by 

hydrocarbon chain linkers of identical or dissimilar length. 
[126,137,140]

 

Polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) is a well-known strong and broad spectrum 

antimicrobial agent with low toxicity, which has attracted the attention for antimicrobial 

finishing in textile industry, mainly for the protection of cellulose fibres. This compound is 

frequently used as a disinfectant in the food industry and in the sanitization of swimming 

pools. It is also being explored as a biocide in mouthwashes and wound dressings. 

[131,137,140,141]
 

 

Figure 2. 24 – PHMB chemical structure. 



 

~ 62 ~ 

 

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

PHMB acts by undermining the integrity of the cell membrane. Its cationic 

molecules interact with the anionic phospholipids in the microbe’s cell membrane, 

increasing its permeability to the point of its disruption, which ends with cells’ death.
[133–

136,138]
 

PHMB antimicrobial activity increases with increasing degree of polymerization, 

which is related with the higher number of sites (biguanide units) available to interact with 

microbe’s cell wall. However, as higher is the molecular weight, the lower is the solubility 

of PHMB.
[126,131] 

PHMB cationic nature allows it to interact with cellulose, not only through hydrogen 

bonds, but also through ionic interactions. In literature it is mentioned that PHMB can bind 

to cellulose through its anionic carboxylic groups. As mentioned before, besides promoting 

a higher antimicrobial activity, polymer length also provides more cationic sites, for 

interaction with cellulose, and thus a stronger binding. For low concentrations electrostatic 

interactions between PHMB and carboxylic groups in the cellulose are dominating. 

However, with increasing of PHMB concentration, hydrogen bonding between PHMB and 

cellulose, becomes dominating, and thus multilayer adsorption is preferential. 
[131,140,141]

 

2.4.3.2. Functionalization with antimicrobials 

Antimicrobial features may be conveyed to materials by functionalization of those 

with antimicrobial agents. In case of synthetic fibres, antimicrobial agents may be added 

before extrusion rendering synthetic fibres with antimicrobial features. In other cases, such 

as natural fibres (e.g. cellulose), antimicrobial agents are applied to fibres by impregnation. 

Then, this agents get attached to fibres either by formation of covalent bonds, electrostatic 

interactions, hydrogen bond or Van der Waals interactions.
[130,138]

 

Another approach for the functionalization of materials with antimicrobials, includes 

the use of encapsulated antimicrobial agents, for posterior application on fibres. 
[142]

 

Microencapsulation is defined as a technology of packaging solids, liquids, or 

gaseous materials in miniature, sealed capsules that can release their contents at controlled 

rates under specific conditions (example Figure 2. 25). 
[142,143]

 

 

Figure 2. 25 – Schematic representation of a capsule containing antimicrobial compounds (adapted from 
[144]

). 



 

~ 63 ~ 

 

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

In the case of textile industry, the closest to tissue paper, encapsulation is used for 

durable fragrances, skin softeners, insect repellents, dyes, vitamins, antimicrobial agents, 

phase change materials and medical applications (antibiotics, hormones and other 

drugs).
[145]

 

The encapsulation of compounds, conveys protection towards harmful conditions, 

from its surroundings, such as, heat, acidity, oxidation, moisture, etc. Additionally, it averts 

the interaction between the encapsulated with its surrounding, which, in some cases, avoids 

negative effects. Besides, it allows a controlled and prolonged release of the bioactive 

principle. Additionally, it may improve chemicals handling, and reduce its exposure to 

workers or consumers.
[145,146]

 This approach has been broadly explored, over the last years, 

especially for drug delivery, and in this context, different types of carriers have been 

investigated, such as liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, silica nanocapsules, solid lipid 

nanoparticles, etc.
[147–149]

 

This methodology purposes aim to reduce the amount of antimicrobial applied, for a 

more cost-efficient utilization of antimicrobial agent. Furthermore, the possibility of 

negative effects on the end product, such as undesired variations on products properties 

(due to the interactions of the antimicrobial with the product compounds) or secondary 

effects on consumers (skin irritation), may be attenuated by using encapsulated 

antimicrobial compounds relatively to non-encapsulated. Besides, this strategy also enables 

a more controlled release of bioactive principle. Therefore, encapsulation of antimicrobials 

has appeared as an alternative to attenuate the aforementioned problematics.
[144,147,150,151]

  

Silica nanostructures have been looked up with interest as a bioactive principles 

carrier. Its porous structure enables a more controlled release (mesoporous uniform 

structure), with a tuneable pore size, high surface area, non-toxic nature, etc. A good 

example of this includes hollow silica nanospheres, which enable a high bioactive principle 

storage and its controlled release. Recently, the synthesis of silica capsules with PHMB has 

been demonstrated.
[152]

 

2.4.3. Perfumes 

The pleasant odour of a product may play as a powerful motivator towards its 

purchase. Therefore, perfumed products consist of an approach, which presume the 

differentiation by manufacturing appealing products to consumer’s senses (e.g. perfumed 

tissue papers). It is noteworthy that human’s sense of smell identifies not only the quality 

of different odours, but, it also associates it (often unconsciously) with feelings ranging 



 

~ 64 ~ 

 

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

from agreeable to unpleasant. Therefore, perfumed products become more attractive while 

unpleasant smells are used for the opposite purpose. 
[153–155]

 

Many companies have followed this strategy through the years, by developing scent 

based trademark products.
[156]

 Consumers relish on products carrying a pleasant fragrance. 

There are plenty examples of perfumed products, ranging from scented letters to washed 

textile fabrics and so forth. 
[157]

 A good well known example are Renova scented facial 

tissue papers (Figure 2. 26) 

 

Figure 2. 26– Examples of some of Renova scented tissue papers. 

Perfumes or fragrances are generally made of volatile compounds collected from a 

wide variety of plants, grasses, spices, herbs, woods and flowers, such as orange blossoms, 

jasmine, rose and lavender.
[158]

 Besides natural origin fragrances, there are also those of 

synthetic origin. All these compounds consist on organic volatile molecules, which are 

often found on gas or liquid state. These compounds include a panoply of compounds such 

as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, acids sulfides, etc. 
[159]

 

To manufacture perfumed products, these are often treated with fragrances, 

typically by spraying, coating or dipping, with a perfume/fragrance. However, the effects 

of the fragrance on substrates, wears off rapidly. The development of attractive and durable 

perfumes has been a long-time aspiration of industry. Ergo, research for controlled-release 

fragrances, as a way to extend fragrance longevity, have been a rather investigated subject 

during the last decades. Once again, similarly to antimicrobial agents (previous section 

2.4.3.), encapsulation appears as a good way to control fragrance release and turn it more 

durable. 
[154,157]

 

Encapsulation allows an improved performance and stability of perfumes 

(substantivity, tenacity or endurance), which tends to wear off by evaporation, interactions 

with other components, oxidation or degradation. Similarly to before (antimicrobials, 

section 2.4.3.), by resorting to perfumes encapsulation, it is possible to protect them from 

surrounding adverse conditions (temperature, pH, water, etc), and therefore achieve a more 

controlled and longer perfume release. Additionally, it facilitates its handling (e.g. most of 

the synthetic nitro- and polycyclic musks used in perfumes, are toxic and non-

biodegradable), improves its affinity towards the substrate, reduces losses, requires less 

amounts of perfume, etc.
[154,159–161]

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

Similarly to before, capsules may be produced from various materials, with a 

variety of shapes (spherical, oblong or irregular, monolithic or aggregates), with single or 

multiple walls. 
[154,160]

 Amongst the most commonly used materials are polysaccharides 

and sugars (gums, starches, celluloses, cyclodextrin, dextrose, etc), proteins (gelatin, 

casein, soy protein, etc), lipids (waxes, paraffin oils, fats, etc), inorganics (silicates, clays, 

calcium sulfate, etc) and synthetics (acrylic polymers, poly(vinylpyrrolidone), etc). 
[154,159]

 

Although when preparing capsules, it is important to bear in bind its end-use, which is a 

determining factor for the selection of the most appropriate material. For example, the 

encapsulation of perfumes in silica nanostructured appear as a rather promising 

encapsulation method for certain applications. Capsules do not swell or change under pH 

changes, or temperature variations, alike some many other materials, such as polymers. 

Other advantages include its inertness, transparency, thermal protection of the active 

ingredient, protection towards oxidation, it high mechanical resistance, nontoxicity and 

biocompatibility. Besides enables the encapsulation of both water-based and oil-based 

liquids.
[154,160–162]

 

2.5. Ultra-high pressure 

High pressure processing, also known as high hydrostatic pressure or ultra-high 

pressure (UHP) has been applied for many years on the production of ceramics, composite 

materials, plastics and artificial diamond, representing nowadays an expanding technology 

in food industry. 
[163–165]

 Recently this technique was applied for the modification of 

biopolymers
[166–173]

 and called attention with relation to improve the performance of tissue 

papers. 

2.5.1. Fundaments 

Ultra-hydrostatic high pressure technology (UHP) has revealed a substantial growth 

during the last years, particularly in what concerns food industry, for food processing and 

preservation, due to the advantages it reveals relatively to other thermal processes. 
[163]

 

This technology uses elevated pressure conditions (100-1000 MPa), which are 

transmitted through a fluid, often water. The technology is based on 3 main principles, Le 

Chatlier principle, the isostatic principles and the microscopic ordering principle. Le 

Chatelier principle
[174]

, states that any phenomena in equilibrium (chemical reaction, phase 

transition, etc) accompanied by a disturbance tends to counter it. So, in case of a pressure 

increase, any phenomenon (e.g., chemical reactions, phase transitions or changes in the 

molecular configuration) which is accompanied by a decrease in volume is enhanced and 

vice-versa. Since many biochemical reactions include volume variations, therefore

biological processes are affected by pressure. UHP mainly affects non-covalent bonds such 

as hydrogen, electrostatic, etc, meaning that low molecular weight components are 

normally less affected whereas high molecules components are more sensitive to 

UHP.
[168,175,176]

 

The isostatic principle,
[168,175]

 is also present on this technology and it implies that 

pressure is applied instantaneous and uniformly, regardless of the samples dimensions (in 

case of solid samples their format remains intact). This particularity constitutes a huge 

benefit, as concerns heat treatments (such as thermal pasteurization), since temperature 

treatments do not allow a uniformly distribution of temperature, generating temperature 

gradients, and due to the high temperatures samples are subjected, it may affect 

thermosensitive compounds. 
[168,175,176]

 

Finally, the microscopic ordering principle
[168,175]

 states that upon constant 

temperature an increase in pressure increases the degrees of ordering of molecules of a 

given substance.  

 

Figure 2. 27 – Schematic representation of the isostatic principle.
[176]

 

2.5.2. UHP applications and effects 

 UHP may be found in many applications, in food industry and for biotechnological 

applications, its major effects include (i) microorganisms inactivation, (ii) biopolymers 

modification (protein denaturation, protein activation/deactivation, gel formation, etc (iii) 

ability to retain food products quality, specially colour and flavour (since UHP mainly 

affects non-covalent bonds) and (iv) effects on products functionality (changes on density 

and texture).
[177]

 However, only biopolymer modification by UHP will be given focus, 

since corresponds to the essence of current work. 

As mentioned above UHP treatment is able to induce changes on structural and 

functional level of biomolecules, and example of this would be enzymes denaturation or 

starch gelatinization. 
[163–168,170–173,176,178–184]

 Additionally, more recently, changes in 

cellulose structure, have also been demonstrated.
[169,185,186]

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

Studies performed by Figueiredo et al
[169]

 with kraft and sulfite pulps under pressure 

condition of 400MPa, demonstrated structural changes in cellulose. It was demonstrated 

that during UHP treatment the crystallites average width in fibrils increases, as result from 

partial cocristalization of crystalline regions on adjacent elementary fibrils, when 

favourably orientated and free of noncellulosic compounds. Additionally, it was also 

revealed that UHP induces forced hydration on amorphous regions enabling an improving 

of fibres swelling abilities, and thus decreasing the hornification effect affecting them. 

Moreover, treated fibres became more flexible and elastic rendering improved mechanical 

properties. Due to forced hydration on amorphous and crystalline regions, fibrils became 

less aggregated and thus more accessible towards chemical reactants, namely diluted 

sulfuric acid.
[169]

 

The improved accessibility of cellulose pre-treated with UHP, was also demonstrated 

as regards enzymes.
[185,186]

 This was demonstrated when treating E. globulus kraft pulp 

with cellulase and xylanase (Figure 2. 28). In these studies, it was verified that UHP pre-

treatment, similarly to before, induced forced hydration, and therefore rearrangements that 

promoted fibril disaggregation and thus higher accessibility towards sites previously 

inaccessible. Owing to these facts the accessibility of enzymes towards cellulose was 

higher and therefore higher rate and degrees of hydrolysis were achieved. 
[185,186]

 Chapter II | Bibliographic Review 

It is yet to discover the effect of UHP on other types of fibres, specially recycled 

fibres, which are highly affected by hornification. This constitutes a rather curious topic 

since papermaking industry feedstock is not solely based on E. globulus pulps. Besides the 

effect of high pressure towards other types of chemical/reactants commonly used on 

papermaking industry also poses and intriguing topic as concerns fibres modification and 

its process efficiency.

 Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  

3.1. Introduction 

With nowadays environmental issues, recycling is recognized as a path towards a 

more sustainable future. A good example is paper recycling. Its benefits are not only 

economical, but also environmental.
[1]

 Although attractive, materials recycling still pose a 

few drawbacks, such as the number of times recycling is possible due to materials 

degradation. 
[1,2]

 In the case of paper recycling, the use of recycled pulp still exhibits 

disadvantages relatively to virgin fibres, which are essentially related to (i) feedstock 

variability, (ii) losses on fibres mechanical/physical properties, (iii) hornification, (iv) and 

impurities.
[1–5]

 

Overall authors agree that the main responsible for recycled pulp properties loss is 

the hornification effect. The hornification effect occurs mostly due to the formation of 

irreversible hydrogen bonds, between fibrils, yielding fibril aggregation, fibre collapse, 

stiffening, inability to swell as originally and hence losses on mechanical and hydration 

properties. 
[2,6,7]

 These structural changes occur mostly due to successive swelling, 

pressing, drying, printing, storing, re-dispersing and deinking processes. 
[2,3,7–10]

 

The inability of fibres to swell like originally represents a rather relevant matter, 

since by becoming stiff and less malleable, these features are transmitted to its end 

products. Besides, the stress fibres are subjected during their life cycles further intensifies 

the hornification effect, leading towards a continuous loss on fibres properties. 
[6–10]

 

The aptitude of fibres for hornification depends on different variables, such as the 

wood origin, the pulping method, fibres biometry, storage conditions and chemical 

composition.
[6,7]

 For example, it has been demonstrated that hornification affects easier low 

yield pulps relatively to high yield pulp. This difference is related to a higher lignin and 

hemicellulose content, such as the case of high yield pulps, which act as a barrier against 

the formation of irreversible hydrogen bond formation between fibrils.
[2,6,7]

 

Although impurities also affect fibres properties hornification is still considered the 

major responsible for the losses felt on the recycled fibres properties. 
[2,11]

 In pulp and 

paper industry these losses are considered a major issue, since they comprise a hindrance 

not only for manufacture but also as regards the end-products features. To surpass these 

issues methods have been developed, through time, as a way to diminish the negative 

effects brought by hornification on fibres. These methods include beating, chemical 

treatment with alkaline solutions, mixture with virgin fibres, fibres fractionation and more 

recently enzymatic treatment.

 Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  
 

In tissue paper industry besides recycled fibres, virgin fibres are also extensively 

used for the production of tissue paper. Being pulps absorbency (hydration abilities), 

softness and its capacity to maintain integrity (mechanical properties) considered as the 

most important features on tissue paper, with special emphasis on absorbency.
[12,13]

 Fibres 

ability to interact with water molecules (facial tissue) and became softer, or its ability to 

absorb vast amounts of water (kitchen paper towels), is essential to tissue paper industry. 

To evaluate materials hydration different methods may be followed, such as moisture 

sorption isotherms, capillary rise tests, contact angle analysis, etc. There are numerous 

tests, which enable the evaluation of a fibres ability to interact with water, which could be 

seen an indirect measurement of pulp accessibility towards OH groups, as mentioned in the 

previous chapter. 

Ultra-High pressure (UHP) emerges here as a non-degrading alternative technology 

with the ability to decrease hornification on fibres and improve its accessibility. The 

potential of UHP on cellulosic pulps has been demonstrated in literature, as concerns E. 

globulus kraft pulp and sulfite pulps, and is fully described in the previous chapter. It has 

been shown that UHP induces structural rearrangements on cellulosic fibres, rendering 

improved accessibility and reduced hornification to cellulosic fibres. 
[14–16]

 

However, there is still much to explore as concerns the use of UHP treatment for the 

modification of recycled fibres, which are highly affected by hornification and which 

behaviour under UHP conditions is unknown. With these in mind, the main purpose of the 

work displayed on this chapter was to evaluate the effect of UHP on recycled and different 

virgin fibres (hardwood and softwood fibres). Additionally, changes in its properties were 

evaluated, with special emphasis on its hydration properties and its ability to introduce 

strongly bound water. All this allowed the evaluation, for the first time, of the hydration 

behaviour of recycled fibres.

3.2. Materials and Methods 

Different cellulosic pulps were provided by Renova. Premium recycled fibres (alpha-

recycled fibres), R, produced by Renova from paper wastes, collected in 30.10.2012 was 

supplied for the studies. Additionally, bleached Eucalyptus Globulus industrial kraft pulp 

(purchased to Portucel Soporcel group, lot 35I-179025), E, was also supplied along with 

bleached softwood pulp (purchased to Botnia group, lot 4B21263), S, for comparative 

reasons.  

3.2.1. Chemical characterization 

When received all cellulosic pulps were analysed according to its moisture content, 

ash content, intrinsic viscosity, carbonyl and carboxyl contents and sugar composition. 

3.2.1.1. Moisture content 

The moisture content from 1g of pulp was determined on an oven at 105ºC following 

norm TAPPI T 412 om-11. 

3.2.1.2. Ash content 

Following procedure 3.2.1.1, the ash content was also determined at 525±25ºC, in 

agreement with norm Tappi T 211 om-07. 

3.2.1.3. Extractives 

? Acetone (99.9%, HPLC grade, Acros Organics) 

The extractives content, in pulp samples, was determined considering norm Tappi 

T204 om-88, using acetone as solvent.  

3.2.1.4. Intrinsic viscosity 

? Cupper-ethylenediamine solution (CED, Panreac) 

? Distilled water 

Intrinsic viscosity was determined by dissolution of pulp samples in CED (cupper-

ethylenediamine) solution, according to norm SCAN-CM 15:88.  

3.2.1.5. Carbonyl content 

? Chloride of 2,3,5-trifenil-2H-tetrazolium (98%, Sigma-Aldrich) 

? KOH (87%, Acros Organics) 

? Ethanol (99%, Acros Organics) 

? Glucose (99%, Sigma-Aldrich)

? Distilled water 

The carbonyl content was determined following procedures from literature.
[17,18]

 The 

method is based on the ability of these groups to reduce the chloride of 2,3,5-trifenil-2H-

tetrazolium (TTC), yielding a compound of red colour called formazan (Figure 3. 1), which 

is easily identified and quantified by UV-Vis spectroscopy. This method is known as the 

Sabolks method. 

 

Figure 3. 1 – Reaction between TTC and carbonyl groups from cellulose. 

For this test a solution A (0.2 M of KOH), a solution B (0.2% (w/w)) of TTC in 

ethanol, glucose, a porous glass filter and a volumetric tube (10 mL) are required. 

Initially, 0.010 g (+0.0001 g) of each sample was weighted into a Soviril tube (5mL). 

Later 0.5 mL of solution A was added followed by 0.5 mL of solution B. The tube was 

then closed and placed in boiling water for 2 min. Subsequently to the reaction, pulp 

should exhibit a red coloured complexion. Afterwards, the tube was placed on ice to cool 

down. The tube content was then filtered with a glass filter, with vacuum, as represented in 

Figure 3. 2 

 

Figure 3. 2 – Image of the volumetric tube equipped with a glass filter used on the procedure. 

Pulp still with red colour was washed with ethanol, continuously until the red colour 

vanished. This operation was performed with a glass rod and ethanol was added for 

washing until the filtrate on the tube made a total volume of 10 mL. The solution was then 

analysed by UV-Vis spectroscopy on a UV-mini-1240 apparatus from Shimadzu, at 546 

nm using a 10 mm cell. At the same time, a blank experiment was also carried out, with a 

similar procedure, but without pulp. The blank was used as reference for all measurements.

i) Calibration curve 

The concentration of aldehyde groups was determined considering a calibration 

curve made with glucose as standard. To do so, a glucose solution was prepared (0.1% 

(w/w)) and 10, 25, 40 and 50 ?L of this solution was placed on 4 tubes. Then, to each tube, 

0.5 mL of Solution A and 0.5 mL of solution B were added. The mixture was then placed 

in boiling water for 2 min. Afterwards, each tube was cooled down on ice and ethanol was, 

then, added until the total volume reached 10 mL. Finally, each solution was analysed by 

UV-Vis spectroscopy, in the same way as before. The calibration curve at the end related 

absorbance with C=O weight (mg). 

Considering the mass of carbonyls determined through the calibration curve, the 

content of carbonyls was determined for each sample according to Equation 3.1, where M 

correspond to C=O mass (mg) considering the calibration curve, and G is the mass of pulp 

weighted.

The amount of carboxyls was determined following an adaptation of norm T237 om-

93. To do so, 2±0.1 g of pulp was weighted and placed into a 500 mL erlenmeyer (in 

duplicate). Then 250 mL of HCl 0.1 M were added and the suspension was left stirring for 

4h, to insure that all carboxyl groups were in its protonated form. Afterwards, the pulp was 

filtered and washed with water until the filtrate pH matched water pH. 

The filtered pulp was weighted and added to 500 mL of NaHCO3 and NaCl solution 

(prepared by dissolving 0.84 g of NaHCO3 and 5.85 g de NaCl in 1 L of H2O). This 

dispersion was then left stirring during, at least, 12 h. Afterwards, the pulp was filtered 

again under vacuum, while the filtrate was collected in a dry buchner flask. Two aliquots 

of this liquid were collected, 20 mL each, and placed into 100 mL erlenmeyers. To prepare 

a blank test, 20 mL of the NaHCO3 and NaCl solution was pipetted into a 100 mL 

erlenmeyer. 

The solution alkalinity was determined by titration with HCl 0.01 M with methyl red. 

The amount of carboxyls in 100 g of dry pulp was determined according to Equation 3.2,

In order to determine the neutral sugar content, on each sample, the procedure 

followed three reaction steps, hydrolysis, reduction and acetylation.
[19]

 

i) Hydrolysis 

The first step consisted on the samples hydrolysis. With that in mind, 10 mg of pulp 

were weighted into a soviril tube (in duplicate). Into each tube, 400 ?L of H2SO4 (72%) 

were added, followed by 3 h incubation at room temperature. Afterwards, 4.4 mL of 

distilled water were added and the tubes were left to incubate at 100ºC for 2h30. Later the 

tubes were placed on ice to cool down. 

ii) Reduction 

The next step consisted on the reduction of sugars resultant from the hydrolysis step. 

To do so 200 µL of 2-desoxiglucose (10 mg/mL) were added as internal standard, to each 

tube. Then 1 mL from this mixture was placed in a new tube, to which 0.2 mL of NH3 

(25%) and 0.1 mL of NH3 (3 M) containing 150 mg/mL de NaBH4, were further added 

(while the tubes are still kept on ice). 

Samples were then left to incubate under 30 ºC during 1 h. Afterwards, all tubes were 

placed again on ice, to cool down. To each tube, 50 µL of glacial acetic acid was added, 

twice, followed by agitation, in order to destroy the excess of NaBH4. 



 

~ 89 ~ 

 

 Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  

iii) Acetylation 

The last reaction step consisted on the acetylation of the sugars reduced in the 

previous step. To do so, 0.3 mL from each tube was poured into new tubes, followed by 

the addition of 0.45 mL of 1-metthylhimidazol and 3 mL de acetic anhydride. 

Subsequently, the tubes were left to incubate for 30 min at 30 ºC and later placed on ice to 

cool down. 

When cooled down, 3.75 mL of distilled water (water excess to destroy the acetic 

anhydride) and 2.5 mL of dichloromethane (extraction of the alditol acetates) were added. 

The mixture was agitated with a vortex apparatus and when phase separation was verified, 

with a Pasteur pipette, the upper layer of liquid (aqueous phase) was removed. Then 3 mL 

of distilled water and 2 mL of dichloromethane were added and mixed again with the 

vortex apparatus. When phase separation was verified the upper layer liquid layer was 

removed again (aqueous phase). The same procedure was repeated three times but without 

the dichloromethane addition. After this procedure, the tubes content was placed under 

nitrogen flow for evaporation and, when dried, to the residue inside the tubes 1 mL of 

acetone was added. Then samples were once more placed under nitrogen flow for 

evaporation. This evaporation procedure was repeated one more time. 

iv) Gas chromatography analysis 

The residue resultant from the previous stage was dissolved in 100 µL of dry acetone 

and 1 µL of the resultant mixture was injected into a chromatographer Focus GC from 

Thermo Scientific, with a Restek Corp column, RTX-225 (L=30 m; id=0.25 mm and 

df=0.25 ?m) and FID detector, under the following conditions: injector temperature at 225 

ºC, column temperature at 220 ºC e detector temperature at 250 ºC.  

The calibration curves determined for each standard were determined and are 

represented in Appendice A. 

3.2.1.8. Acid methanolysis for analysis of monosaccharides and uronic acids 

? NaCl (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) 

? H2SO4 (96%, Acros Organics) 

? Methanol anhydrous (99,9% HPLC grade, Acros Organics) 

? Sorbitol (98%, Sigma-Aldrich) 

? Pyridine (99%, Acros Organics) 

? Hexamethyldisiloxane (99%, Acros Organics) 

? Trimethylchlorosilane (99,5%, Sigma-Aldrich)

 Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  
 

The acid methanolysis procedure was performed with HCl anhydrous (in methanol). 

In order to prepare this reactant 75 g of NaCl were weighted and placed into a double neck 

round glass flask. The main entry of this flask was meant for concentrated H2SO4, while 

the other worked as an exit for the gas produced during the reaction (HCl). This output was 

linked into a recipient, on ice, containing dry methanol (50 mL), followed by a second 

recipient containing NaOH for neutralization of the residual HCl gases. The final solution 

of methanol and HCl was titrated to access the molar content of HCl, which was 

determined to be 1.8 M. 

After preparing the main reactant, the methanolysis procedure took place according 

to reference
[20]

. To do so, 4.5 mg of fibres were weighted and placed on a soviril tube, to 

which 2 mL of HCl (in methanol) were then added. Each sample was tested in duplicate. 

Afterwards, each tube was left to incubate for 4 h during 100 ºC.Then to each tube 80 ?L 

of pyridine and 1 mL of standard sorbitol solution 0.1 mg/mL (prepared with methanol) 

was added to each tube). From each tube, 2 mL of the mixture was then removed, placed 

on new tubes, and evaporated with N2. To the remaining dry residue 70 ?L of Pyridine, 

150 ?L of hexamethyldisiloxane and 80 ?L de trimethylchlorosilane were added. After 12 

h at room temperature, the samples were analysed by GC-MS. The samples were analysed 

by a gas chromatographer Trace Gas Chromatograph 2000 series, equipped with a mass 

detector from Thermo Scientific DSQII, using helium as carrier gas (35 cm/s). The 

chromatographic conditions were as follows: column capillary DB-1J&amp;amp;W (30 m x 0.32 

mm i.d.0.25 lm); initial temperature of the column 100 to 4 ºC/min 175 ºC following by 

175–12 C/min; final temperature 290 ºC, and detector temperature 290 ºC.  

3.2.1.9. Determination of residual lignin and hexuronic acids amount 

? Cadmium oxide (99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) 

? Ethylenediamine (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) 

? Distilled water 

The residual lignin content and the amount of hexuronic groups (HexA) were 

determined according with literature
[3]

, through UV-Vis spectroscopic analysis of samples 

dissolved in cadoxen. Cadoxen was prepared from ethylenediamine (EDA) aqueous 

solution and cadmium oxide, following the same reference.
[21] 

Cadoxen is a solvent capable of dissolving pulp, with properties favourable to UV-

Vis spectroscopy, such as the absence of a visible band and transparency in the UV region. 



 

~ 91 ~ 

 

 Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  

When dissolved on cadoxen, polysaccharides exhibit great stability to oxidative 

degradation, enabling thus the storage of such solutions for a long periods of time. These 

advantages allow the quantification of lignin through UV spectroscopy, at 280 nm, on 

bleached and non-bleached pulp, dissolved in cadoxen. Cadoxen itself exhibits an 

absorption and below 220 nm. However, the UV region above 220 nm can still be 

considered for analysis. 

Between 230 and 350 nm, it is possible to identify the contribution of residual lignin 

and hexuronic groups from xylans. The absorption at 231nm is attributed to the 

hexenuronic groups. In the case of residual lignin this last exhibits an absorption band at 

280 nm, a shoulder between 240-255 nm and some absorption at 230 nm.  

Considering this the absorptions at 231nm and 280 nm of pulp solution in cadoxen 

can be expressed by Equations 3.3 and 3.4, where ?231

absorptivity’s of the hexuronic groups (HexA) and of residual lignin (Lig), at its

To determine the amount of residual lignin and the amount of hexuronic acids, the 

procedure was carried out as described below. Air dried pulp, with known moisture 

content, was weighted, 25 mg, and placed on a 50 mL erlenmeyer for dissolution with 15 

mL of cadoxen. The procedure was performed in duplicate. All solutions were then left 

stirring for1-3 h until pulp dissolution. Then 15 mL of distilled water was added to each 

Erlenmeyer, and the mixture was left homogenizing for 10-15 min. All solutions were then 

filtered with a glass porous filter and analysed by UV-Vis spectroscopy, on Jasco V 560 

UV–VIS spectrophotometer. 

All spectra were recorded considering as reference a solution 1:1 water:cadoxen, on a 

quartz cell with 10 mm dimensions, between 200 nm and 500 nm. The concentrations of

3.2.2. Hydrostatic ultra-high pressure treatment (UHP) 

? Propylene glycol (96%, Dowcal) 

? Distilled water 

To perform the hydrostatic ultra-high pressure treatment (UHP) pulp samples were 

dispersed in distilled water with 2% consistency and placed in sealed containers. The 

samples were subjected to 400 MPa, during 15 min, at 20 ºC, in a High-pressure U33 

equipment, with a 100 cm
3
 capacity, with propylene glycol:water (1:1) as transmission 

medium. 

After the treatment, the samples intended for the preparation of handsheets for 

analysis were stored, while the samples meant for other tests were filtered, air dried and 

stored in a plastic bag. 

3.2.3. Preparation of standard handsheets for analysis 

Pulp dispersions prepared according to Renova procedure norm PT.Lab.106 were 

prepared and used to produce standard handsheets following ISO 5269-2:2004, on a Rapid-

Köthen (Karl Schröder KG) sheet former. The same was performed using the dispersions 

treated with UHP from section 3.2.2.

3.2.4. X-ray diffraction (XRD) 

Samples with and without HP were subjected to x-ray diffraction, in a Philips X’Pert 

diffractometer, equipped with a CuK? (?=0.154 nm) monochromatic radiation source. 

To become possible, the analysis of pulp samples, pellets of each sample were 

prepared. With that in mind, 100 mg of each pulp were weighted and a 5 ton pressure was 

applied to each sample with a press. All pellets were analysed between 4 and 40 º of 2?(º) 

at 0.02 º/scan. The determinations of the parameters, D200, b and of the crystallinity 

degrees, for each sample, were performed in agreement with literature methods.

Structural changes on pulp samples were also followed by 
13 

C solid state Cross 

Polarization-Magic Resonance (

C CPMAS NMR). The spectra were registered on a 

Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer. Samples were packed into a zirconia’s rotor sealed with 

Kel-FTM caps and spun at 9 kHz. Acquisition parameters were as follows: ca 7000 scans 

with a 90 proton pulse, a cross-polarization contact time of 1 ms and a recovery delay of 

2.5 s. The determination of the crystallinity indexes were performed considering the 

methods form literature.
[16,23]

 

3.2.6. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) 

? D2O (99.8%, Acros organics) 

? KBR (99+%, Acros Organics) 

? P2O5 (98%, Acros Organics) 

Changes in fibres structure were also monitored by FTIR of deuterated samples. 

With that in mind, a set of two replicas from each sample were prepared. Initially, both 

replicas were dispersed under deuterated water, although while replica one was subjected 

to HP treatment (400 MPa, 15 min), replica two remained under D2O for 15 min (the same 

amount of time required for the UHP treatment). It is noteworthy that both replicas were 

initially dispersed with the sample consistency (2%) on D2O. Afterwards, all pulp samples 

were filtered, allowed to hydrogenate under room conditions, then placed at 105 ºC to 

achieve complete dryness and then stored in a desiccator under P2O5. Pellets with pulp and 

KBR were then prepared, from each sample, (2 mg of pulp: 250 mg of KBR) for analysis 

on a Bruker optics tensor 27, with 128 scans and with 4cm
-1

 of resolution. FTIR spectres 

were normalized an approximately at 2900 cm

3.2.7. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 

Pulp samples were analysed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), on a 

Hitachi S4100 equipment at 15 kV. Each sample was attached to a SEM support with 

carbon tape and then subjected to Au/Pd sputtering before analysis. 

3.2.8. Capillary rise  

Capillary rise tests were performed according to ISO 8787:1986, which is based on 

the Klemm Method. 

3.2.9. Contact angle analysis 

? Formamide (Acros Organics, 99%) 

? Diiodomethane (Acros Organics, 99%) 

? Distilled water 

Contact angle analysis was performed on the standard handsheets prepared in 3.2.3., 

on a Surface Energy Evaluation System equipment from dataphysics, through the sessile 

drop method, considering three different liquids, water, formamide and diiodomethane. 

The polar and dispersive component from the surface free energy was determined for 

each sample according to the Owen-Wendt method
[24]

, using the data collected from the 

contact angle from each liquid in each sample. 

3.2.10. Texture analyses 

The texture from each handsheet sample was also analysed through 

microtopographic analysis, performed on an Altisurf 500 profilometer. The scanned area 

was 4.8x4.8 mm
2
 with 2 ?m of resolution. For each sample, four acquisitions were 

obtained in different sites. 

3.2.11. Zeta Potential 

Variations on the pulp samples charge were also followed by zeta potential 

measurements, on pulp dispersions diluted with distilled water. Complementarily, each 

solution pH was also measured using a pH Meter, model HI2020 - edge® multiparameter, 

from Hanna Instruments. Zeta potential measurements took place on a Malvern Zeta Sizer 

Nano Series, apparatus using disposable plastic cells.

? Mg(NO3)2 (99%, Acros Organics) 

? KI (99,+% Acros Organics) 

? (NH4)2SO4 (99%, Carlo Erba). 

Moisture sorption isotherms determination followed a static gravimetric method, at 

25, 30 and 35ºC, in a wide range of relative humidity values (0-100%), using different 

saturated salt solutions to insure so.
[25]

 

Beforehand, pulp samples (1g) were left drying on a desiccator (with P2O5), in nylon 

bags, to ensure complete dryness. When completely dried, samples were attached to the top 

of closed flasks containing saturated salt solutions, and then placed in a water bath (Jubalo 

SW23) with controlled temperature. All samples were weighted periodically until 

equilibrium was reached (approximately 7 days). 

The experimental data were then fitted to GAB (Guggenheim, Anderson and de 

Boer) model. The nonlinear regression analysis of the experimental data was performed 

using Matlab r2012a curve fitting tool. The adequacy of the fitting was evaluated 

according to the coefficient of determination (R
2
) and RMSE (root mean squared error), 

devolved by Matlab.  

3.2.13. Calorimetric analysis 

The calorimetric analysis was performed on a thermally isolated container with a 

thermometer with 0.01 ºC accuracy. Water was weighted (200 g) and placed on the 

calorimeter for a blank experiment. Afterwards, 2 g of absolutely dried pulp (previously 

dried over P2O5 in a desiccator), was placed on the calorimeter and changes on the system 

temperature were followed through the thermometer. The difference of temperature 

attained during the experiment was corrected with a blank experiment (only water) and 

then, the heat released during the wetting process of cellulosic fibres was determined 

considering the equations 3.9-3.11

3.3. Results and Discussion 

3.3.1. Pulps characterization 

Cellulosic pulps supplied by Renova, namely recycled fibres, R, bleached kraft E. 

globulus pulp, E, and softwood pulp, S, were received and analysed for its composition 

and other general parameters. The results achieved are presented in Table 3. 2 and 3. 3, 

respectively. 

Pulps composition was accessed according to its sugar composition from its 

hemicelluloses. Recycled fibres, R, displayed a composition similar to that of hardwood 

pulps, with high amounts of glucose and xylose, although very small amount of galactose 

and mannose were also detected. These residual sugar content could be easily explained by 

variabilities on the feedstock used to produce recycled pulp, which consisted, mainly, of 

hardwood pulp products (e.g. office papers), along with residues of softwood pulp 

products. 

As regards E, this displayed a typical composition of E. globulus hardwood pulp, as 

described in the literature, with a high amount of glucose and xylose, due to the presence 

of glucuronoxylans (the most abundant hemicelluloses on this type of wood).
[26]

 Whereas S 

exhibited a high content of glucose accompanied by a lower xylose content, with 

monosaccharides such as mannose, galactose and arabinose, typical from softwood 

pulps.
[26]

 The second method (methanolysis) for sugar analysis, relatively to the first, 

enables the determination, exclusively, of hemicelluloses including uronic acid residues, 

which is not possible through the first method. For example, in the case of 4-O-Me-GlcA, 

this compound is easily found on hardwood pulps (O-Acetyl-4-O-methylglucuronoxylans, 

typical hardwood xylan).

Other general parameters were also investigated such as the ash content, intrinsic 

viscosity, extractives, residual lignin, hexenuronic acids, carbonyls and carboxyls content, 

and these results are displayed in Table 3. 3.

Hexenuronic acids (mmol/kg) - 5.2±0.02 10.0±0.02 

Recycled fibres, R, exhibited a high amount of ash, which is agreement with the 

presence of inorganic impurities, such as fillers. These results are indicative that recycled 

fibres still possess impurities (acquired during its life cycle) that were not possible to 

remove completely, even after the purification process.
[2]

 On the other hand, virgin pulps 

(E and S), as expected from bleached virgin pulps, exhibited a low ash content, which is 

atributed to the multiple washing stages they were subjected during its production.
[27,28]

 

The intrinsic viscosity parameter was also evaluated. In the case of R, the registered 

low intrinsic viscosity suggests fibre degradation (cellulose depolymerization during fibres 

life cycle).
[2]

 At the same time, virgin fibres (E and S) exhibited typical values.
[27]

 

Although in the case of S, viscosity could be affected by a severe pulping process, thus 

producing lower polymerization degrees, which affected intrinsic viscosity. 
[27]

  

The carbonyl content displayed the highest value for R, suggesting the eventual 

presence of chromophore structures in recycled fibres, most likely due to organic 

impurities or due to the fibres ageing.
[2]

 On the other hand, E and S exhibited a lower 

carbonyl content, which is in agreement with virgin bleached pulps.  

Residual lignin and hexenuronic acids (HexA) content were also determined.
[21]

 

Results were achieved for both virgin pulp, E and S, however, for R the same was not 

possible by this method. A possible explanation would be the interference of R impurities 

on the procedure, which relies on spectroscopic analysis of cadoxen-dissolved pulp. 

The determined values registered a similar and low residual lignin content in the 

studied pulps. In addition, S exhibited a higher amount of HexA than E. This difference 

could be attributed to a harsher cooking procedure suffered by S, when compared to E, and 

a predominant TCF bleaching of S pulp.

3.3.2. Structural changes upon UHP treatment 

Samples R, E and S, were subjected to UHP treatment at 400 MPa during 15 min. 

These conditions were selected based on work previously performed.
[14–16]

 For simplicity, 

each sample treated with UHP will be labelled as RHP, EHP, and SHP, respectively. 

Structural changes induced by UHP on fibres were followed by various techniques, 

such as XRD, NMR, FTIR of deuterated samples, zeta potential and SEM analysis. 

Additionally, the effects of UHP treatment on pulps hydration abilities were also accessed 

through capillary rise tests, contact angle analysis (a measure of wettability), moisture 

sorption isotherms and calorimetric analysis along with thermal analysis (TGA/DSC). 

3.3.2.1. XRD and NMR 

Structural changes on cellulosic fibres were accessed through XRD and 
13

C RMN, 

both on UHP treated and non-treated pulp samples. XRD data enabled the determination of 

the crystallinity degree (CD), and unit cell parameters, D200 (average crystallite width from 

plane 200) and b (average height of cellulosic crystalline cell). Table 3. 4 display the 

results achieved for all UHP treated (RHP, EHP and SHP) and non-treated samples (R, E 

and S). When comparing treated with non-treated samples, overall UHP samples revealed a 

higher average crystallite size, D200, up to ca. 16%. Besides, its CD also exhibited an 

increase, when comparing with non-treated samples, with exception of the pair S and SHP.  

These changes mentioned above, have already been demonstrated previously, 
[16]

 

where it was showed that UHP treatment induces rearrangements on cellulosic fibres 

structure were suggested, leading towards the convergence of conveniently orientated 

crystallites, and thus larger crystallites (co-crystallization). Moreover, the rearrangements 

induced by UHP also could produce chain rearrangements on paracrystalline regions 

yielding, more crystalline material on the surface, and thus higher CD.
[16]

Changes in fibres structure were also followed by

C solid-state NMR (Appendices 

B). The data obtained was used to determine the crystallinity index of each sample. This 

parameter was determined considering the ratio between the area of ordered (A86ppm-92ppm) 

and amorphous (A79-86ppm) regions.
[23]

 These results are presented in Table 3. 5 and from 

the results obtained, it was possible to observe that UHP treated samples revealed higher 

crystallinity index when compared with non-treated samples. These results further support 

XRD results, as concerns the changes suffered by fibres on its crystalline regions,
[16]

 and 

allows to confirm the possibility of method error in case of XRD data, for samples pair S 

and SHP. Additionally, the presented results suggest that R, E and S, upon UHP treatment, 

exhibit similar behaviour not differing much from each other. 

3.3.2.2. FTIR of deuterated samples 

Structural changes on fibres along with the presence of strongly bound water, as 

result of UHP treatment, were investigated by FTIR of pulp samples subjected to H/D 

exchange with heavy water, in liquid phase, as described in section 3.2.6. The spectra of 

samples were normalized according to 2900cm
-1

 band (C–H stretching vibration) and are 

represented in Figures 3.3 and 3.4.

Figure 3. 4 – Normalized FTIR of deuterated samples E and EHP, a); and S with SHP b). 

The spectra of recycled fibres, with and without UHP, (RHP and R, respectively) in 

Figure 3. 3, display the typical OD band
[29–31]

 at 2494cm
-1

for RHP, while R did not show 

this band. The presence of absorbance at approximately 2500cm
-1

 in RHP spectra suggests 

that either OD groups were not able to perform the exchange from OD to OH, due to 

structural changes, or, considering the effects induced by UHP (structural rearrangements, 

increased accessibility, forced hydration, etc).
[16]

 D2O entered deep inside the fibre 

structure, into previously inaccessible sites, remaining imprisoned under the form of 

strongly bound water (not leaving even at 105ºC). Additionally, the OH band shift from 

3445cm
-1

 to 3387cm
-1

, into smaller wavelengths, also suggests thus, since it entails more 

intensive OH bonds. 

As regards virgin fibres FTIR spectra showed some different results (Figure 3. 4). 

Upon UHP, hardwood (EHP) and softwood fibres (SHP), both revealed an intense peak at 

2488cm
-1

and at 2489 cm
-1

, respectively (OD band). These peaks were accompanied by 

shoulders at smaller wavelengths. Nevertheless, E and S, in opposite to recycled fibres, 

exhibited a smaller, but still well detectable, peak at ca 2940 cm
-1 

and 2943cm
-1

, 

respectively (even after drying of non-pressurized pulps). Although, it is noteworthy that 

the OD peak intensity of EHP and SHP was much more expressive than that on RHP.  

Since recycled fibres (hornified fibres) exhibit a collapsed structure, lower 

macroporosity and hindered accessibility, the penetration of D2O on these fibres is 

probably more difficult than on virgin fibres (less collapsed structure with higher 

macroporosity). Therefore, it is possible that these facts contribute for the higher D2O 

penetration and retention on virgin fibres, comparatively to recycled ones, even upon UHP. 

The fact that virgin UHP untreated pulps still exhibited a visible OD band, could be 

explained by irreversible changes suffered by virgin fibres during the drying process, 



 

~ 102 ~ 

 

 Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  
 

which hindered the H/D exchange (resistant OD). Hence, it is possible that the same was 

not observed for recycled fibres, R, for the above mentioned reasons (hornified fibres with 

low porosity). It is also noteworthy that, deuteration in most cases is not completely 

reversible if structural alterations take place on virgin fibres, due to drying (hornification), 

the exchange from deuterium to hydrogen becomes more unlikely.
[29–32]

 Moreover, the 

shift observed from R to RHP, on the OH band, suggests the possibility of shorter distance 

and more intensive interactions between polymer molecules and water (forced hydration), 

after the UHP treatment. The hypothesis of water imprisonment by UHP treatment and 

other of its effects is on a scheme presented in Figure 3. 5. 

 

Figure 3. 5– Schematic representation of the phenomena behind UHP treatment (adaptated from Scallan microfibril 

drying scheme 
[11,33,34]

). 

3.3.2.3. Zeta Potential 

The effects induced by UHP on fibres were further analysed by zeta potential 

measurements (Table 3. 6). As expected for cellulosic material all samples exhibited 

negative charges.
[35]

 This occurs because when a charged surface is immersed in a solution 

containing ions, an electrical double layer is formed (Figure 3. 6). In the case of cellulose 

(negatively charged), the sources behind its charge could be related with the dissociation of 

ionic groups on the particle surface (e.g. COOH groups of cellulose). The negatively 

charged surface (Figure 3. 6) attracts oppositely charged ions (counter-ions) and repels 

ions of the same charge (co-ions). If it were possible to separate the two-phase, they would 

carry equals and opposite charges.
[35]

 

Cellulose is negatively charged throughout a wide pH window and depending on the 

cellulose origin its zeta potential approaches zero between 4-5.
[36,37]

 The ionisable groups 

UHP 



 

~ 103 ~ 

 

 Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  

on cellulosic fibres may be carboxyl groups, hemiacetal, sulfonic acid groups, phenolic 

groups among some others. Under normal papermaking conditions, the carboxyl and 

sulfonic acid groups are the major contributors to fibre charge. Most of the carboxyl 

groups originate, either from non-cellulosic components in wood itself or are created 

during the pulping and bleaching operations. Sulfonic acid groups are introduced with 

sulfite treatment during CTMP or chemical pulping.
[35]

  

 

Figure 3. 6 – The electrostatic double layer on the surface of a material.
[38]

 

Although negatively charged, UHP treated samples exhibited lower negative zeta 

potential charges than untreated ones. These results suggested the diminishing of surface 

potential (?0) or the increasing of the Stern layer. As cellulosic pulp was not subjected to a 

radical chemical or physical modification with a drastic change of its structure, the changes 

in ?0 are very unlikely. Most likely, the forced hydration led to the diminishing of the 

surface conductivity of cellulose material, due to the delocalization of its negative charge, 

thus increasing the Stern layer. 

From a papermaking point of view, the decrease of pulps zeta potential, upon UHP 

treatment, could be considered a positive point, since it may contribute, for example, to 

decrease the demand on retention aids to facilitate paper formation.

3.3.2.4. SEM 

The morphology of UHP treated (RHP, EHP and SHP) and non-treated (R, E and S) 

samples was also accessed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Recycled fibres 

are represented in Figure 3. 7 (R and RHP), while virgin fibres images are represented in 

Figure 3. 8 (E and EHP), and in Figure 3. 9 (for S and SHP). Overall, it was possible to 

observe, on the surface of treated fibres, an increase on surface irregularity. It was 

suggested that macrofibrils upon UHP “swelled”, standing out more than before. These 

gains in bulk and surface roughness are in agreement with fibril disaggregation and forced 

hydration, especially, forced hydration. Similar features have been observed for cellulosic 

fibres, in literature, using a optic microscopic imaging. 
[16]

 Therefore it explains the 

bulkiness gained by macrofibrils, and thus its higher exposure on the surface.

3.3.3. Interactions between fibres and water upon UHP treatment 

The affinity between fibres and water plays a key role in tissue paper industry. 

Therefore, this point was of special attention in order to better comprehend how UHP 

affects fibres. This was critical for recycled fibres due to their hard hornification. With this 

in mind, water affinity in samples, with and without UHP treatment, were investigated, 

regarding its affinity towards water using capillary rise tests, contact angle measurements, 

moisture sorption isotherms, thermal and calorimetric analyses. 

3.3.3.1. Capillary rise tests 

The contribution of UHP towards fibres affinity to water uptake was investigated by 

capillary rise tests and its results are displayed in Table 3. 7. It was found that upon UHP 

(RHP, EHP, SHP), samples revealed higher capillary rise when compared with non-

treated samples (R, E, S). Recycled fibres registered an increase of ca. 11% from R to 

RHP, while virgin fibres displayed an increase of ca. 3.5 % from E to EHP, and of 19% 

from S to SHP. These findings evidenced that UHP promoted fibres accessibility towards 

water due to the fibril disaggregation and thus contributed to the decrease of 

hornification,
[15,16]

 negatively affecting recycled fibres. These effects originated not only 

from extra free OH groups (previously unavailable) but also from a less collapsed structure 

of cellulosic fibres and improved macroporous structure in pulp sheets, i.e. for an easier 

ascension of water molecules through fibres.  

The UHP treatment effects were particularly strong on recycled fibres (R and RHP) 

and on softwood virgin fibres (S and SHP). In the case of recycled fibres due to 

hornification, its structure is collapsed, with low porosity and poor accessibility to free OH 

groups. Upon UHP treatment, the rearrangements and fibril disaggregation provoked by 

this treatment, originate improved accessibility to inner fibre layers and to more free OH 

groups. Since recycled fibres display more limited hydration skill, due to the 

aforementioned reasons, this may explain why its results were better than those of its 

homologous, hardwood pulp. In the case of softwood fibres (S and SHP), these were the 

ones displaying the highest increase in the capillary rise. Although being “dried” virgin 

fibres, it is possible that its structure, in terms of porosity and accessibility to OH groups, 

were somehow jeopardized. This may be true if during its production harsh conditions 

were used. Therefore, although being “virgin fibres” its full potential is not available. As 

result, upon UHP treatment, it is possible that UHP reversed the aforementioned 

limitations enabling a substantial improvement of softwood fibres capillarity.

3.3.3.2. Contact angle analysis 

Cellulosic fibres wettability was also investigated by contact angle (CA) 

measurements, with different liquids of known contribution of polar and apolar energy 

(water, formamide and diiodomethane). These tests have been performed from cuts of 

handsheets prepared from each sample. CA results were also corrected (Table 3. 8) 

considering the surface roughness of samples (Table 3. 9), using the Wenzel equation. 
[39–

41]
 

As regards recycled fibres, samples treated with UHP (RHP) revealed a slight 

increase of CA with water, when compared with untreated samples, which is indicative of 

a slight decrease on wettability. From CA results, surface free energy was also determined, 

according to Owen-Wendt relationship.
[24]

 The obtained results showed a small decrease of 

the surface free energy, from untreated to UHP-treated recycled fibres (from R to RHP), 

with slight variations on its polar (decrease) and dispersive (increase) contributions. It is 

possible that this slight decrease on hydrophilicity could be related with a redistribution of 

hydrophobic impurities in recycled fibres, during UHP treatment. However, the small 

variations registered and its deviations (between non-treated and UHP-treated samples), 

suggest that further studies, with other techniques, are required to evaluate more correctly 

the effect of UHP treatment on recycled fibres hydrophilicity. 

In the case of hardwood virgin fibres, CA with water decreased, in samples subjected 

to UHP treatment (ca. 10% from E to EHP). This result is indicative of an improvement on 

the handsheets wettability.
[42]

 Additionally, the surface energy results revealed an increase 

in samples treated with UHP, comparatively to untreated samples, with variations on its 

polar (increase) and dispersive (decrease) contributions. The increase in the surface energy, 

especially of its polar contribution, confirms the improvement of this pulp hydrophilicity, 

after the UHP treatment. This fact may be related to the increased amount of free OH 

groups in pulps that appeared with the disaggregation of fibrils. Besides, fibres 



 

~ 107 ~ 

 

 Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  

macroporosity also plays an important role. Thus, it is possible that the capacity of UHP to 

improve porosity also contributes to an improved wettability. 

Similar to recycled fibres, softwood virgin fibres also revealed ambiguous results, 

with no significant variations of CA and of its surface energy and its respective 

contributions. It is possible that the type of fibres (softwood, long fibres) is responsible for 

the different impact of UHP treatment on fibres, comparatively to hardwood virgin fibres 

(short fibres). However, further studies with other techniques are required to scrutinize the 

effect of UHP treatment on the hydrophilicity of softwood virgin fibres.

Table 3.9 shows that samples prepared from fibres subjected to UHP treatment 

(RHP, EHP and SHP) exhibited higher roughness, comparatively to untreated fibres.  

The wetting behaviour of materials is governed by both their chemical composition 

and its geometric surface structure. Accordingly, an increase in roughness, on a 

hydrophobic/hydrophilic surface, results in more interfacial area, for interaction between 

surface and liquid. Therefore increasing roughness may originate a material more 

hydrophobic/hydrophilic.
[39,43]

 In the case of the three pulps under study, when pre-treated 



 

~ 108 ~ 

 

 Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  
 

with UHP, the roughness of the handsheets prepared was higher, comparatively to those 

prepared from untreated pulps. However, only hardwood virgin fibres revealed a rather 

significant variation on wettability. Hardwood virgin fibres (from E to EHP) 

hydrophilicity and the increase in roughness may explain the decrease of CA with water 

and the variations in surface energy. However, the same may not be valid for softwood 

virgin fibres and recycled fibres. Hence, it is noteworthy the necessity of complementary 

tests to scrutinize more correctly fibres hydration behaviour upon UHP. 

3.3.3.3. Moisture sorption isotherms  

Moisture sorption isotherms are widely used to evaluate materials hydration 

mechanisms. With this in mind, this method was employed to investigate the changes 

resulting from UHP treatment on cellulosic fibres. Thus, samples treated (RHP, EHP and 

SHP) and not treated by UHP (R, E and S) were scrutinized for its moisture sorption 

isotherms at 25, 30 and 35 ºC. The results achieved are represented in Figures 3.10 and 

3.11.

Figure 3. 10 - Moisture sorption isotherms at 25, 30 and 35 ºC for recycled fibres treated (RHP) and non-

treated (R) by UHP. 

The moisture sorption isotherms determined for R and RHP evidenced a rather 

significant difference, from each other, in the studied temperature range. The changes were 

quite evident, since RHP exhibited improved moisture sorption, describing a pattern closer 

to that of virgin fibres (type II isotherm according with de Brunauer classification
[44]

), with

monolayer formation. In opposite, R exhibited a quite limited moisture uptake, as 

consequence of hornification, with insignificant monolayer formation (at all studied 

temperatures). In contrast to RHP, R behaviour was much similar to that of a type III 

isotherm, typical for hydrophobic materials.
[45]

  

The sorption isotherm changes found from R to RHP can be explained by the effects, 

previously discussed, induced by UHP treatment. UHP enabled structural rearrangements, 

at fibrils level (i.e. decrease of fibril aggregation and pore/fibres collapse), which 

contributed to a significant increase of accessible surface with free OH groups. As a 

consequence, the limitations on water sorption by hornified recycled fibres decreased 

substantially, after the UHP treatment.
[14–16]

  

Even though recycled fibres (R) are known to be highly hornified, damaged, 

contaminated with impurities, and possibly with chemical modifications
[2]

, hornification is 

still considered the main responsible for its limited accessibility to free OH groups and thus 

its limited water sorption. Nevertheless, the already mentioned effects, induced by UHP, 

contributed significantly to improve recycled fibres water sorption, which for tissue paper 

consists in a rather relevant issue.  

In the case of virgin fibres (E, EHP, S, and SHP, Figure 3. 11), when compared to 

recycled ones (R and RHP) a different trend in water sorption was observed. Although 

virgin fibres described the typical type II isotherm behaviour 
[45,46]

, when treated with UHP 

(EHP and SHP), a small decrease in its moisture sorption capacity, Xeq, was registered, at 

all studied temperatures. 

In virgin fibres, the fibrils aggregation is much less expressed than in recycled fibres. 

Hence, the decrease found could be related to the effect of forced hydration, i.e. the 

presence of significant amounts of strongly bound water, enough to diminish free OH 

groups and hinder water molecules absorption to form the monolayer. It has been 

demonstrated
[16]

 before, and confirmed by results of the present study, that UHP is able to 

decrease aggregation, improve accessibility and to introduce strongly bound water in 

fibres. It may be proposed two competing processes upon UHP treatment of pulp. One is 

related to the appearance of new accessible cellulosic surface free OH, due to fibrils 

disaggregation and another is the formation of cellulosic clathrate hydrates (Figure 3. 12), 

where part of free OH groups is involved in strong interactions with water (less free OH). 

In the case of virgin fibres, with relatively high accessible surface, the second process is 

predominating, whereas, for recycled fibres, the first one is the most important. This 

proposition is supported by the results of H/D exchange on virgin and recycled pulps.

Thus, the amount of strongly bound D2O in virgin pulps was much superior than in 

recycled pulps (Figures 3.3 and 3.4)

The experimental data was also fitted considering models with physical meaning, 

widely employed in the study of these type of systems, such as BET and GAB models. 

However, here will only be considered GAB model, which is less limiting, more versatile

The fittings were performed on Matlab2012a, on its curve fitting tool. The adequacy 

of the fitting was evaluated considering the values devolved by Matlab of R
2
 (coefficient of 

determination) and RMSE (root mean squared error). GAB parameters were determined by 

non-linear regression analysis. The sorbents specific area was also determined in 

agreement with Equation 2.2 from Chapter 2, section 2.1.6.1. The results achieved are 

given in Table 3. 10 - 3.12. 

GAB parameters were estimated and analysed for R and RHP (Figure 3. 10). The 

estimated monolayer, Xm, for R displayed quite high values, which do not agree with the 

observable pattern followed by the isotherm, with no significant monolayer. The fact that 

GAB model estimated a rather high value for the monolayer, suggests that the model was 

not able to predict this parameter correctly. It is noteworthy that the aforementioned model 

is mostly used to describe type II isotherms (with monolayer formation), which may 

explain its difficulty estimating a more accurate value.

Nevertheless, in the case of RHP, since it behaves as a type II isotherm, with 

monolayer formation, a more correct estimate of the monolayer was possible. It also 

revealed, as expected, a decreasing monolayer with temperature.
[47,48]

 The monolayer 

formation on RHP is a sign of the decrease on fibres hornification (more free OH groups 

for the formation of the first layer of water molecules). The specific surface area was also 

determined, however, a comparison between R and RHP was not possible, due to its direct 

dependence with Xm, which was despised due the aforementioned reasons.  



 

~ 112 ~ 

 

 Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  
 

Parameter C and k were also estimated. While the first parameter is related to the 

strength of binding in the monolayer, the other is indicative of the organization of the 

multilayer.
[49]

 The values determined for C, as expected, decreased on both R and RHP 

with temperature. However, when comparing R with RHP values an increase was found, 

which is in agreement with the formation of the monolayer in RHP. The formation of the 

monolayer led to intensive interactions between cellulose free OH groups with water, 

corresponding to a higher enthalpy of hydration. 

The estimates of parameter k displayed a decrease in R, and an increase for RHP, 

with increasing temperature. This parameter correlates water molecules properties from 

multilayer and bulk water. As k approaches 1, little is the distinction between multilayer 

molecules and liquid ones. In the case of R sample, due to its lacking of free OH groups to 

form the monolayer, the multilayer gains increasing significance and thus its contribution 

plays a bigger role on water sorption, comparatively to the monolayer, with increasing 

temperature. On the other hand, since RHP is able to form a monolayer, in terms of water 

sorption, with increasing temperature, the multilayer loses importance. Its values increase 

towards one suggest that the properties of the water molecules multilayer tend to those of 

bulk water, with increasing temperature.
[49]

 

When comparing the values of k for R and RHP, it was observed that the values from 

the first were lower than those estimated for the second. This suggests that in RHP, the 

contribution of the multilayer for water sorption is less significant, as previously 

mentioned, due to the formation of the monolayer, where more intensive interactions 

between cellulose and water molecules have a higher contribution. 

From the temperature dependence of parameters C and k, it was also possible to 

determine C0, k0 and ?Hc and ?Hk (Equations 2.3 and 2.4 from Chapter 2, section 

2.1.6.1.). Parameters C0 and k0 are entropic in nature and, similarly to C and k, one is 

related with the monolayer, while the other is related with the multilayer. C0 values are 

expected to be smaller than 1 (molecules prefer the multilayer than the monolayer from an 

entropic point of view), while k0 values are expected to be higher than 1 (high entropy of 

molecules in liquid water).
[49]

 As expected, C0 displayed very small values, which became 

even smaller on UHP treated samples (RHP), due to the formation of the monolayer. Also, 

k0, which was lower than 1, for samples treated with UHP, became higher than 1, possibly 

due to the higher entropy existing between water molecules. As discussed before, these 

results are in agreement with a higher accessibility to OH groups and a higher water 

uptake, due to UHP. 



 

~ 113 ~ 

 

 Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  

The estimates of ?Hc and ?Hk (enthalpy of the monolayer formation and multilayer, 

respectively)
[49]

, were determined. It was found from non-treated (R) to UHP treated 

samples (RHP), an increase on ?Hc (from 98.3 to 133.1 kJ/mol) and a decrease on ?Hk 

(from 9.4 to -3.8kJ/mL). The ?Hc results are in agreement with the formation of a 

monolayer in RHP, as discussed previously. Since a higher amount of water molecules are 

bound to the surface in the monolayer, a higher solvation enthalpy was registered. 

Furthermore, the decrease found on ?Hk, is also indicative of the decrease in importance of 

the multilayer. As previously discussed, it is possible that with the formation of a more 

composed first layer of molecules at the surface (monolayer of RHP), the water molecules 

in the multilayer interact less intensively (in RHP comparatively to R), which requires less 

enthalpy to remove the multilayer molecules. 

From the values of ?Hc and ?Hk (Equation 2.7, Chapter 2, section 2.1.6.1.), it was 

also possible to estimate the net isosteric heat of sorption (?Hs,t), which were 88.9 kJ/mol 

and 136.9 kJ/mol, respectively for R and RHP. The substantial increase found from the 

first to the latter, further supports UHP as a regenerative treatment, able to decrease the 

limitation imputed by hornification on fibres hydration abilities. 

For comparison, the moisture sorption isotherms of virgin fibres (E, S, EHP and 

SHP) were also fitted according to GAB model. The fitting results are displayed in Table 

3. 11 and 3. 12. From both tables, it is possible to observe that GAB described well all 

isotherms as displayed by the high values of R

 (near 1) and low RMSE values.

Similarly to before, GAB parameters were estimated. The estimate of the monolayer, 

Xm, as expected, decreased with increasing temperature. When comparing non-treated 

samples (E and S) with UHP treated samples (EHP and SHP) a decrease of Xm was found. 

These results are in agreement with the previously discussed decrease in the moisture 

uptake from virgin fibres treat with and without UHP. Due to the proportionality existing 

between Xm and S (specific surface area estimate), this last also exhibited the same trend 

revealed by Xm, i.e. it decreased, with increasing temperature, from non-treated (E and S) 

to samples treated with UHP (EHP and SHP). Parameter C (from E and S to EHP and 

SHP, respectively), similarly to before, decreased with increasing temperature, as 

expected. Also, when comparing non-treated (E and S) with fibres treated with UHP (EHP 

and SHP), the values where smaller for this last, which, as previously discussed, is related 

to the lower amount of water molecules required to form the monolayer, due the presence 

of strongly bound water.  

As regards parameter k results, with increasing temperature, the tendency found in E 

and EHP, was similar to that encountered on R and RHP, i.e. for samples not treated with 

UHP k decreased with temperature, while the opposite was verified on samples treated 

with UHP. This suggests that in E the formation of multilayer has a higher contribution to 

water sorption than in EHP, with increasing temperature. Also, when comparing untreated 

(E) with samples treated with UHP (EHP), k values were higher in this last. As previously 

discussed, it is suggested that the presence of strongly bound water may contribute to less 

intensive water interactions and thus a higher entropy between multilayer water molecules 

(as k tends to 1, water molecules properties approach those of bulk water). 



 

~ 115 ~ 

 

 Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  

In the case of softwood virgin fibres, S and SHP, k values revealed a similar trend 

(increase), on both samples, with increasing temperature. With increasing temperature, in 

both cases, the multilayer contribution to water sorption becomes less important. This 

difference, relatively to hardwood fibres, could be attributed to the differences in the type 

of the fibres studied (different fibres morphology). Nevertheless, upon UHP treatment, 

from S to SHP, k values increased (nearer 1), which suggests, as discussed for E and EHP, 

that the presence of strongly bound water in fibres contributes for the less intensive 

interactions between multilayer molecules and for its higher entropy. 

Similarly to before, from the temperature dependence of C and k, the parameters, C0, 

k0 and ?Hc and ?Hk were determined. Constant C0 revealed very small values as expected. 

Parameter k0 revealed an increase upon UHP, from E to EHP. This trend is similar to that 

observed from R to RHP, indicative of a higher entropy in multilayer water molecules, 

which endorses the already discussed hypothesis. In contrast with hardwood virgin fibres 

results, in softwood virgin fibres, from S to SHP, k0 decreased, although its value remained 

higher than 1. This result is indicative of a decrease in the entropy of multilayer molecules 

on SHP. It is proposed, once more, that this difference in results between both virgin fibres 

could be related with the differences in morphology existing between both types of fibres. 

Parameters ?Hc and ?Hk were also estimated from GAB parameters. From E to EHP 

?Hc, displayed a decrease from 47.5 to 37.4 kJ/mol. This decrease is in agreement with 

previous discussed results, since fewer water molecules form the monolayer, lower is the 

solvation enthalpy registered. In opposite, from S to SHP (softwood virgin fibres) a small 

increase from 121.88 to 126.04 kJ/mol was observed. While in the case of hardwood virgin 

fibres the results are in agreement with the retraction of the monolayer, in this case, this 

variation could be attributed to method deviations.
[45]

 

As concerns ?Hk, divergent results between hardwood and softwood pulps were once 

more registered. From E to EHP a decrease was found, while from S to SHP an increase 

was registered. While in the first case ?Hk decrease is in agreement with a lower 

contribution of multilayer to water sorption discussed above, the second suggests the 

opposite. It is suggested that this divergence in results could be related with methods 

deviations. It has been reported in the literature
[45]

 that although GAB method is the most 

recommended to describe cellulosic materials, its parameters may suffer great deviations 

and still present the same curve, which may explain some of the divergences found. 

Nevertheless, considering both ?Hc and ?Hk, the net isosteric heat of sorption (?Hs,t) 

was also estimated. The results achieved revealed an increase from E to EHP (from 36.9 to 



 

~ 116 ~ 

 

 Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  
 

48.7 kJ/mol) and a very small decrease from S to SHP (ca. 0.8%). Although water uptake 

was lower from E to EHP, ?Hs,t increase could be related to the formation of more 

intensive interactions with the captured water molecules. In the case of S and SHP the 

decrease observed could be explained by the decrease in the water uptake. Nevertheless, as 

mentioned above, due to some deviations of the model parameters, these results should be 

complemented with further studies with other techniques. 

It is, however, noteworthy some of the similarities found between the results of 

recycled fibres and hardwood virgin fibres. As confirmed in fibres characterization, 

recycled fibres are made mostly of hardwood fibres, therefore this feature may explain the 

similitude in behaviour between each other results. 

The total heat of sorption, Qs, was also estimated following Clausius-Clayperon 

relationship (Equations 2.5 and 2.6 from Chapter 2, section 2.1.6.1.) along with GAB 

fittings for the three types of pulp, with and without UHP. 

  

(a) (b) 

Figure 3. 13 – Total heat of sorption determined from Clausius-Clayperon relationship and GAB parameters, as function 

of moisture sorption (a) comparison between E and EHP with R and RHP; (b) comparison between S and SHP with E 

and EHP). 

The total heat of sorption as a function of moisture sorption on the equilibrium (Xeq) 

is represented in Figure 3. 13a for hardwood fibres and recycled fibres and in Figure 3. 13b 

for both virgin fibres. Recycled fibres exhibited a significant increase in its total heat of 

sorption, upon UHP, which is in agreement with its improved hydration abilities, as 

discussed before, although the values cannot be compared. 

Virgin fibres results were different between both types of pulps. Hardwood fibres, 

upon UHP (EHP), displayed a maximum that shifted at smaller Xeq, with higher Qs, that 

afterwards drops until the heat of sorption equals the heat of evaporation of water. Usually, 

high values of Qs maximum at low moisture content are associated with strong attraction 



 

~ 117 ~ 

 

 Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  

forces between active sorption sites and sorbate molecules in the monolayer, whereas 

lower values of Qs are associated with weaker interactions.
[49]

 Therefore, it is suggested 

that the increase in the total heat of sorption at low Xeq, in EHP, may be attributed to more 

intensive interactions, possibly due to the presence of the strongly bound water. 

In the case of softwood virgin fibres (S and SHP) total heat of sorption, Qs, exhibited 

curves with a maximum near each another. Although S exhibited a slightly higher one 

(174.4 kj/mol versus 172.0 kJ/mol), when comparing with SHP. Besides this difference, 

the sample treated with UHP displayed a narrower curve. 

As previously mentioned, it is possible that the observed variances/fluctuations on 

results could be explained by the variation of the GAB parameters estimated. An example 

of that includes the fact that constant C varies greatly in magnitude,&amp;lt;10 to &gt;150000, for 

adsorption and desorption, with little influence on the shape of the isotherm. 
[45]

 This 

variance, as regards the determination of other parameters dependent of C, may affect 

directly and induce variation on its estimation. Even though GAB model is considered the 

best choice for fitting pulp and paper moisture sorption isotherms (with constants that have 

a theoretical meaning), their interpretation sometimes could be less clear, similarly to 

empirical equations. 
[45]

 A way to improve the acquired data would possibly pass through 

testing more temperatures to ensure a higher accuracy. 

3.3.3.4. Calorimetric analysis 

Calorimetric analysis was performed to determine the integral heat of wetting, on 

samples treated with and without UHP. The results achieved are represented in Table 3. 13. 

Recycled fibres results, from R to RHP revealed an increase in the integral heat of 

wetting from R to RHP. These results suggest the presence of more free OH groups for 

interaction with water, which is in agreement with previous results tendencies, such as the 

case of moisture sorption isotherms, which brings further confirmation on the ability of 

UHP regenerating hornified recycled fibres hydration abilities.  

As regards virgin fibres, both hardwood and softwood virgin fibres registered a 

decrease in the integral heat of wetting in samples treated with UHP. The results suggest 

that less free OH groups were available for interaction with water, as discussed previously, 

due to the strongly bound water presence. These results endorse previous ones, such as the 

tendencies observed in moisture sorption isotherms, and allow to confirm the effects 

brought by UHP on cellulosic fibres.

Complementary thermal analysis studies were carried out in order to evaluate the 

changes in the vaporization enthalpy of hydrated samples (conditions of 100 HR%, at room 

temperature). First, the samples moisture content was determined by TGA, then this data 

helped to evaluate the vaporization enthalpy by DSC, through the integration of the 

endothermic peaks corresponding to moisture vaporization (Table 3. 14).

SHP 14.3 -63.3 

In the case of recycled fibres, the results showed, from R to RHP, that the enthalpy 

of vaporization (required to evaporate free water) decreased slightly. It is possible that this 

result is related with recycled fibres limited macroporosity, and thus a lower presence of 

free water content. Even though UHP treatment promoted recycled fibres accessibility to 

free OH groups, these last, as observed in moisture isotherms, help to formation the 

monolayer, where molecules are interacting strongly with the surface (1
st
 layer) and not 

easily removed by vaporization. However, it is not clear what happens in the case of free 

water. Therefore, it is possible the small variation found in the vaporization enthalpy 

between both samples, are of little significance.

 Chapter III | Effect of ultra-high pressure on cellulosic fibres structure  

As regards virgin fibres, in both cases, samples subjected to UHP treatment showed 

higher vaporization enthalpies, when comparing with untreated samples. Contrarily to 

recycled fibres, virgin ones have higher macropososity. Also, it is possible that the 

combination of this trait with the increased accessibility to free OH (as result of UHP 

treatment), may contribute to a higher content of free water. This hypothesis may explain 

the increases in enthalpy found between non-treated and UHP-treated virgin pulp samples.

3.4. Conclusions 

The effects of UHP treatment on different cellulosic fibres (recycled and virgin 

hardwood and softwood fibres) were demonstrated. The studies allowed to conclude that 

UHP treatment promoted rearrangements on the studied fibres structure, namely fibril 

disaggregation, the reverse of fibre collapse, and improved fibres accessibility, into sites 

previously inaccessible. 

The structural changes on fibres were primarily confirmed by XRD, 
13

CNMR and 

FTIR of deuterated samples. Here the reorganization of crystalline/amorphous regions 

upon UHP was demonstrated by the increase of crystallinity and the increase of the 

average crystallite size. Additionally, it was demonstrated that UHP treatment promotes 

fibres forced hydration and improved accessibility. While the first is more predominant in 

virgin fibres, the latter plays a bigger role in the case of recycled fibres. In the case of this 

last, this implies a decrease on the hornification of recycled fibres and improvement of its 

properties, such as hydration. These were demonstrated by different tests (such as capillary 

rise, moisture sorption, the integral heat of wetting, etc). In the case of virgin fibres, the 

presence of significant amounts of strongly bound water, although it affected the available 

free OH groups content (as demonstrated by H/D exchange, moisture sorption, calorimetric 

analysis, etc), it improved hardwood fibres wettability and both types of virgin fibres 

capillarity. 

These results represent an interesting prospect over tissue paper production since 

they validated the ability of UHP to improve recycled fibres properties, which affects not 

only the manufacturing process but also the final products features. An example of a 

manufacture advantage includes the lower zeta potential values of samples treated with 

UHP, which implies a lower demand of retention aids and even a better retention of other 

additives such as dyes.  

Moreover, the ability of UHP to further improve fibres properties, without 

mechanical or chemical processing, represents a potential alternative to improve fibres 

features, such as recycled fibres hydration skills. It is noteworthy that the hydration 

abilities of fibres are of utter importance for tissue paper.

 Chapter IV | The effect of ultra-high pressure on the papermaking properties of pulp 

4.1. Introduction 

The constant demand for improved performance of tissue papers has stimulated 

companies to develop more effective processes of stock preparation and paper sheet 

formation, for an improved productivity and quality parameters. Mechanical and physical 

properties are rather relevant features on this matter, since they outline the end product’s 

performance. To improve these features, changes aimed to improve fibres performance 

may be considered. 
[1,2]

 

The bonding between fibres governs paper sheet properties. This is due to the 

formation of hydrogen bonds between fibres that are drawn together and oriented by water 

stream during papermaking. The adequate alignment of fibrils and their bonding between 

one another, in a paper sheet, provides fibres considerable resistance to being pulled out. 

This resistance is higher with increasing fibre length, fibre organization and mutual 

compression on the crossover areas of the fibres, as well as by the cohesiveness of all the 

fibrils, that are on contacting surfaces and that range in size from the visible to molecular. 

[2,3]
 Hemicelluloses on fibres also play an important role on fibre bonding, not only by 

being present on their surfaces providing sites for interfibre interaction, but also by 

attracting water into the interior of fibres, softening its structure and turning it less rigid.
[2–

4]
 

During papermaking processing many changes occur, yielding losses on pulps 

properties. These effects affect strongly recycled fibres due to the repetitive cycles of 

drying, swelling and pressing those were subjected.
[5–7]

 However, drying is still accounted 

as the main responsible affecting fibres properties. It influences negatively fibre’s strength, 

fibre’s swelling and it’s bonding, which affects directly paper strength features.
[5,8–10]

 

These changes are mainly caused by the hornification effect. As mentioned in previous 

chapters, hornification occurs due to structural changes on fibres, induced by stressful 

conditions (such as drying, pressing, etc), which prompts rearrangements on the fibres 

chains, fibril aggregation resulting in the irreversible deterioration of papermaking 

properties. In particular, hornification lead to losses on fibres hydration abilities and turns 

them stiffer. 
[11,12]

 In order to decrease the effects of hornification different approaches may 

be followed, such as chemical treatments with alkaline solutions or beating. 
[5,7,8,12,13]

 

The variety of pulp feedstocks available for papermaking made a demand for a 

fundamental process able to improve fibres quality that can be applied on all types of 

pulps. With this purpose, pulp beating, one of the main processes used in stock preparation, 

is often employed.
[14]

 



 

~ 130 ~ 

 

 Chapter IV | The effect of ultra-high pressure on the papermaking properties of pulp 

Pulp beating or refining consists in pulps mechanical modification to achieve pulp 

properties suitable for papermaking. 
[14,15]

. Its main purposes include improving fibres 

bonding ability (to form strong and smooth paper sheet), swelling in water, sometimes 

shorten long fibres for a better sheet formation, or to develop other pulp properties such as 

absorbency, porosity, or optical properties.
[16]

 

Beating enables fibres to “felt” uniformly, to soften, and to fibrillate, in order to 

impart strength to paper. The main effects caused by beating include i) fines creation; ii) 

internal and external fibrillation; iii) fibre cutting or shortening and iv) fibres 

deformation.
[3,15,16]

Together these effects are able to induce important changes to pulp. 

Beating improves paper strength properties, prompts a reluctance of fibres to part with 

water (on the paper machine) and improves the affinity and retention of additives, such as 

dyes and filling materials. Internal fibrillation, also allows the sorption of additional water 

around the newly exposed inner surfaces, therefore improving the ability of fibres to 

interact with water. However, because fibres surfaces are fibrillated, swelling enables 

fibrils not only to form extra links with adjacent surfaces, (especially if the surfaces are 

rough), but also to increase fibres bounding area by forming reinforcements around it. 
[3,14–

17]
 

Ultra-high hydrostatic pressure (UHP) emerges here also as a potential non-

degradative treatment able to improve pulp and paper properties. Studies employing UHP 

on cellulosic fibres have demonstrated the UHP effects on fibres, namely its ability to 

induce rearrangements on fibrils, yielding fibril disaggregation, and thus higher 

accessibility into sites previously inaccessible (rearrangements and decrease on fibres 

hornification). 
[18–20]

 Therefore, the effect of UHP pre-treatment of recycled and virgin 

fibres on the papermaking properties of corresponding pulps was studied. The UHP effect 

on the pulps beating behaviour was evaluated when the treatment was applied just before 

the beating or in the middle of the refining process. Simultaneously, the development of 

strength properties of pulps was assessed.

4.2. Materials and Methods 

Cellulosic pulps were provided by Renova, namely Recycled fibres, R, bleached 

Eucalyptus Globulus industrial kraft pulp, E and bleached softwood pulp, S. The pulps 

used in these studies were the same as mentioned in previous chapter. 

4.2.1. Sequences of beating and UHP treatment 

The combination of beating with UHP treatment and its benefits was studied 

according to three different sequences (Table 4. 1): B-HP (beating followed by UHP 

treatment), HP-B (UHP treatment followed by beating), and B1-HP-B2 (beating at fixed 

number of PFI revolutions, followed by UHP treatment and finalizing beating).  

The three sequences were employed considering fixed UHP conditions (400 MPa, 10 

min), and in case of B1-HP-B2, a fixed pre-beating treatment (fixed PFI revolutions) was 

applied to pulp samples, followed by UHP treatment and by a last beating stage.

Pressure variation studies were also performed, considering UHP pressure condition 

of 400 MPa, 500 MPa and 600 MPa, 10 min, at fixed beating conditions (1000 PFI 

revolutions for R, 3000 PFI revolutions for E and 6000 revolutions for S) 

4.2.2. Hydrostatic ultra-high pressure (UHP) treatment 

UHP treatment was carried out with a pulp suspension, dispersed in distilled water 

(2% consistency), sealed in HDPE flasks, and submitted to hydrostatic high pressure (400 

MPa, 500 MPa or 600 MPa), at room temperature (20 ºC), on a Hyperbaric model 55 

equipment. Afterwards, if UHP was the last stage of the ongoing sequence, a part of the 

sample was filtered, air dried (to ca. 8%) and stored, while the other part was directly used 

to prepare standard handsheets.  

In case of samples that were to be subjected to beating, after UHP, these were filtered 

until they met the conditions required for that step.

4.2.3. Pulp beating 

Previous to pulp beating samples weighting 30 g (moisture free) were prepared and 

then dispersed in agreement with ISO 5263-1:2004. Beating was carried out on a PFI mill 

according to ISO 5264-2:2011. 

4.2.4. Handsheet preparation 

When required standard paper handsheets were prepared according to ISO 5269-2, 

on a Rapid-Köthen (Karl Schröder KG) sheet former. 

4.2.5. Physical and mechanical properties analysis 

Fibres drainability was tested by analysing the Schopper-Riegler degree according to 

ISO 5267-1:1999. Also the handsheets thickness, density, specific volume and bulk were 

evaluated according to ISO 534:2011. Tensile index, stretch%, Tear index, burst index, air 

resistance (Gurley method) and capillary rise, were evaluated in every sample according to, 

ISO 1924-2:2008, ISO 1974:2012, ISO 2758:2014, ISO 5636-5:2013 and ISO 8787:1986, 

respectively. Opacity was also evaluated in agreement with ISO 2471:2008. 

4.2.6. Fibre analysis 

Alterations on fibres morphology were monitored with a Fibre Tester from Lorentzen 

&amp;amp; Wettre. To do so, 0.2 g of moisture free pulp was dispersed in 200 mL of distilled water. 

After dispersion was achieved, all suspensions were positioned to be analysed by the 

equipment, using available software.

4.3. Results and Discussion 

4.3.1. Pulp drainability 

Hardwood virgin pulp (E), softwood virgin pulp (S) and recycled pulp (R) were 

submitted to different sequences of beating and UHP treatment, to investigate the benefits 

brought by the combination of these treatments to fibres properties. The applied sequences 

were HP-B (UHP followed by beating), B-HP (beating followed by UHP) and B1-HP-B2 

(beating pre-treatment at fixed PFI revolutions, followed by UHP and beating) (Table 4. 1). 

For these tests the pressure applied on pulp suspensions was fixed at 400 MPa (10 min). 

Pulps drainability was investigated for the three pulp types, as function of PFI revolution 

(Figure 4. 1).

 Chapter IV | The effect of ultra-high pressure on the papermaking properties of pulp 

revolutions, when compared to R without UHP treatment. The registered increase of ºSR 

in these trials was up to twice to that without UHP treatment, meaning that half energy 

may be required to develop fibres into that point. These results in terms of energy cost 

constitute a rather attractive point, since beating contributes to the major energy 

consumption in papermaking. 

On the other hand, as concerns sequence B-HP, a slight lower values of ºSR were 

registered, with respect to R, which was attributed to UHP treatment as the last stage. It 

has been demonstrated in previous chapters and literature
[20]

 that UHP induces fibril 

disaggregation and forced hydration, causing fibrils enlargement. This explains the results 

achieved by B-HP, since fibres are “bulkier”, there is more vacant space between one 

another, being easier for water to drain. 

 At the same time, by applying beating after UHP treatment (HP-B) it seems that 

fibres became more susceptible to beating (enhanced fibre accessibility caused by UHP 

treatment) and thus, higher fibrillation may be achieved. These events are in agreement 

with the increased water draining resistance (higher ºSR values). Similarly, the same 

justification may be used to explain the behaviour in B1-HP-B2 sequence. In this case, the 

initial beating stage fibrillates fibres, which after UHP become “bulkier”, being more 

accessible to water (UHP effect). At the last beating stage, further fibrillation took place, 

which explains the substantial increase on beatability, and therefore the increased 

resistance to water draining. 

In case of virgin fibres E and S (Figures 4. 1b and c, respectively), sequence B1-HP-

B2, registered a slight increase on ºSR between 2000 and 4000 PFI revolutions and as 

high as 6000 PFI revolutions, respectively. The other two sequences (B-HP and HP-B), in 

both cases (E and S) displayed either slightly lower or similar ºSR values. The use of UHP 

treatment after beating, and thus fibres enlargement (due to forced hydration), explain the 

decrease of ºSR. Since fibres became “bulkier”, with less hydration capacity more non-

bond water is available, thus favouring the water draining. The beating after UHP 

treatment (HP-B) results, for hardwood virgin pulps (E pulps), showed slightly lower or 

similar ºSR relatively to untreated pulp, E. Overall again B1-HP-B2 sequence enabled the 

higher increase on ºSR values, for the three evaluated pulps. 

4.3.2. Fibre Morphology 

Variations on fibres morphology were also analysed by parameters such as weight-

average length (Lw), coarseness, and mean kink index. These parameters were analysed at 

fixed beating conditions (1000 PFI revolutions for R, 3000 PFI revolutions for E and 6000

PFI revolutions for S), and at fixed pressure conditions (400MPa, 10min), for all 

sequences. 

Table 4. 2 display the results obtained for recycled fibres (R samples). As concerns 

the fibre length, only upon sequence B1-HP-B2 a decrease in fibres length was registered. 

This may be attributed to fibres shortening induced by the 2
nd

 step of beating, probably due 

to the increased coarseness of fibres after UHP processing. In fact, an increase of 

coarseness was registered, of 29% and 28%, from R to HP-B, and from R to B-HP, 

respectively (Table 4. 2). The use of UHP may explain these increases, since, as mentioned 

before, it provokes forced hydration and thus fibrils enlargement (cell wall 

enlargement).
[20]

 However, in the sequence B1-HP-B2, the final coarseness was diminished 

in relation to HP-B and B-HP segments, due to fibre wall dilapidation, result from the 

synergetic effect of UHP treatment with two beating stages. 

Mean kink index results revealed a decrease from R to HP-B, and from R to B-HP, 

of 30% and 28%, respectively. The decrease of the number of deformations in fibres could 

be associated to the combination of effects brought by UHP treatment, (disaggregation and 

forced hydration) and beating (fibres straightening).

Virgin pulps E and S, were also analysed for variations on fibre morphology. The 

results achieved are represented in Table 4. 3. As concerns fibres length, E samples did not 

register significant variations. In opposite to recycled fibres, virgin hardwood fibres are 

less damaged. Thus, it is possible that hardwood virgin fibres (short fibres) are not as 

affected by fibres shorting and cutting during beating, as recycled fibres (made majorly 

form hardwood fibres, as determined in Chapter 3). Also for being short they may be less 

prone to deformations relatively longer fibres. As regards S samples, slight variations were 

verified within the error of determination.  

Coarseness results, similarly to length, revealed small variations on E samples, upon 

the different sequences of refining. Due to UHP treatment, in B-HP and HP-B sequences a 

higher coarseness was registered, than with unbeaten pulps, which is in agreement with 

UHP aptitude for forced hydration and fibril enlargement. However, upon B1-HP-B2, the 

combination of two beating sequences with UHP reduced coarseness, due to an improved

 Chapter IV | The effect of ultra-high pressure on the papermaking properties of pulp 

beating efficacy (higher cell wall dilapidation). Like hardwood virgin fibres, softwood 

virgin fibres, S, exhibited a similar behaviour. This result may be explained by the 

hypothesis used to discuss hardwood virgin fibres results.  

Mean kink index data exhibited its decrease in hardwood virgin fibres, E, 

deformations (such as wrinkles or knees) (ca. 15%) for B-HP and an increase (ca. 11%) in 

case of HP-B. As for B1-HP-B2, this last did not exhibited relevant variations. These 

results suggest that UHP as last stage, enabled fibre straightening and the decrease on the 

fibres deformations. Thus it is possible that improved straightening of fibres thanks to UHP 

forced hydration and fibres enlargement could explain the results achieved.
[20]

 

As regards the mean kink index results for S fibres, the variation found displayed 

rather variable behaviour. This variation could be ascribed to their length and thus variable 

behaviour towards both UHP and beating.

4.3.3. Physico-mechanical properties 

Paper physical and mechanical properties were also studied on samples untreated (R, 

S and E) and treated by sequences HP-B, B-HP and B1-HP-B2. 

The bulk of handsheets (cm
3
/g) was examined for each beating sequence. As regards 

R samples (Figure 4. 2a), a decrease of bulk in HP-B and B1-HP-B2 sequences was 

observed, comparatively to R, while, in case of B-HP, a slight increase was found. These 

results suggest that the first two sequences were able to produce denser handsheets, while 

B-HP revealed the opposite effect.

/g) as a function of PFI revolutions of R (a), E (b) and S (c) pulps, treated by sequences HP-B, B-HP 

and B1-HP-B2. 

An explanation for the increased paper density may be related with increased fibres 

fibrillation (resulting from beating), which agrees with increased ºSR values (Figure 4. 1). 

Besides, beating favoured fibres plasticity and compressibility for a more efficient packing 

of fibres, enabling the formation of dense handsheets, as seen after HP-B and B1-HP-B2 

sequences. 

On the other hand, applying UHP after beating (B-HP) showed different features, 

suggesting that beating let fibres became more accessible during UHP treatment to forced 

hydration. As result from this last, fibres become “bulkier” (fibres enlargement) creating 

higher porosity on handsheet network, and thus decreased density. 

Hardwood virgin fibres, E samples (Figure 4. 2b) revealed no significant bulk 

variations in different beating sequences. Here results from different treatments were quite 

similar. This difference, relatively to recycled fibres, could be related to strong 

hornification of recycled fibres possessing already damaged cell walls.

 Chapter IV | The effect of ultra-high pressure on the papermaking properties of pulp 

In the case of softwood fibres (Figure 4. 2c), despite the similarity of conventional 

beating (S) and those with UHP treatment, some lower bulk values were detected after HP-

B and B1-HP-B2 beating sequences. This result suggests denser handsheets due to an 

efficient packing and interfibre interaction of fibres, caused by beating after UHP treatment 

(fibres fibrillation).

Burst index was also evaluated as a function of PFI revolutions. Recycled fibres 

samples, R, (Figure 4. 3a), displayed a slight increase of burst index in sequence HP-B, 

from 1500 revolutions onwards. Also, a similar behaviour was observed for B1-HP-B2. 

These increases suggest that UHP treatment when applied between beating stages, 

improved interfibre bonding. On the contrary, B-HP sequence revealed a decrease of burst 

index with increasing of PFI revolutions, which could be attributed to an efficient forced 

hydration of fibres, thus forming bulk network with decreased overlapping area of fibres.

 Chapter IV | The effect of ultra-high pressure on the papermaking properties of pulp 

The intrinsic frailty of recycled fibres also may have contributed to the handsheet fibre 

network of refined pulp. 

As concerns both virgin E (Figure 4. 3b) and softwood S fibres (Figure 4. 3c), little 

variations were found along beating in all sequences. These little variations may be 

attributed to the virgin fibres intact cell wall, before the treatments, contrarily to recycled 

fibres (beaten and damaged fibres). In other words, the effect of UHP in different beating 

sequences was levelled out.

Tensile strength for R samples (Figure 4. 4a) revealed a slight decrease after all 

beating sequences, relatively to untreated R. This fact contradicts the slightly decreased 

bulk of handsheets beaten in HP-B and B1-HP-B2 sequences, which may be explained by

 Chapter IV | The effect of ultra-high pressure on the papermaking properties of pulp 

intrinsically damaged recycled fibres having weak points in fibres that did not allowed the 

increase of handsheets strength. 

The tensile strength of virgin pulps, E (Figure 4. 4b) and S (Figure 4. 4c), did not 

vary significantly, along with the beating in all applied beating sequences. This is in tune 

with the beating behaviour of fibres (Figures 4. 1b and c) and the bulk of handsheets 

(Figures 4. 2b and c) of virgin fibres, refined with and without the application of UHP in 

beating sequences.

The analysis of stretch (%) as a function of PFI revolution for R samples (Figure 4. 

5a), revealed an improved elasticity of fibres network in handsheets, when applying the 

UHP steps in the refining scheme. This is a result of forced hydration of fibrils, thus 

improving their plasticity.

 Chapter IV | The effect of ultra-high pressure on the papermaking properties of pulp 

E samples (Figure 4. 5b) also registered slightly higher stretch % in all three beating 

sequences, especially in B1-HP-B2. Again, it may be suggested that UHP treatment 

promoted the plasticity and elasticity of fibres. A similar trend was verified for S samples 

(Figure 4. 5c), which was especially notable up to 6000 revolutions. The differences 

between recycled and virgin fibres may be explained, if recalled, by the fact that the former 

ones are already beaten and possess a damaged structure, while the latter ones originally 

exhibit an intact fibre wall. Thus, upon UHP treatment recycled fibres may develop 

drainability and be modified easier and more extensively than virgin fibres.

The tear index was also evaluated and the results for R samples are displayed in 

Figure 4. 6a. It was found, for all beating sequences, that tear index increased along 

beating, when UHP was implemented. Although, this increment was not so high (ca. 5%), 

it may be concluded that UHP treatment improved interfibre bonding in paper network.

Virgin fibres also exhibited an increase of tear index values (Figure 4. 6b), for all 

beating sequences containing UHP stages. In the case of E pulp, the sequence displaying 

the highest increase varied with beating development, while with S pulp (Figure 4. 6c) 

samples beaten by B-HP were the ones exhibiting the highest tear index values (ca. 40% 

increase at 2000 revolutions). These results demonstrated the potential of UHP processing 

to improve fibres bonding, due to the synergetic effect of UHP with beating (improved 

accessibility imparted from UHP processing and enhanced fibrillation efficiency in 

beating).

 Chapter IV | The effect of ultra-high pressure on the papermaking properties of pulp 

so evident for the high beating degrees (&gt;2000 revolutions), especially for HP-B and B1-

HP-B2 sequences. These observations, in general, indicated the increase of paper porosity, 

while applying UHP before, and, especially, after beating. This is in tune with increased 

bulk of pulp handsheets, upon last UHP stage, in the beating sequence. It is thus 

understandable that coarser and bulkier elastic fibres form more porous network, than less 

coarse and plastic fibres possessing increased contact area. 

Similar features were found for virgin fibres in E and S pulps (Figures 4. 7b and c), 

especially when high refining energies are involved (&gt;2000 revolutions for E and &gt;6000 

revolutions for S). It is possible that in the case of S (softwood fibres), by applying UHP 

conjugated with two beating stages, higher impact on fibres is achieved (more fibrillation, 

deformation, fibres shortening, cutting, fines formation), rendering higher bonding area 

improved fibre packing, and thus less vacant sites (less porosity). 

It may be also claimed that differences found between the beating sequences for 

recycled fibres and virgin fibres could be related with the fact that recycled fibres were 

already beaten in the past. 

4.3.4. Optical properties and capillarity 

Other properties were also evaluated to complement previous data. These properties 

include opacity (an optical property) and capillarity (measure of paper hydration abilities). 

The dependence of optic properties, i.e. opacity and capillarity for different beating 

schemes with UHP were also evaluated. 

As could be expected, pulps refined in conjugation with UHP stages demonstrated 

high opacities than conventional beaten pulps (Figure 4. 8). The highest increase of opacity 

was registered when the beating sequence was before UHP treatment (B-HP and B1-HP-

B2). This can be explained by bulkier pulps fibres obtained in these sequences (Figure 4. 

2). The highest light reflectance was observed for the recycled fibres. The highest effect of 

UHP stages on the opacity increment was also obtained for recycled pulp (Figure 4. 8). 

This fact may be justified by the presence of residual fillers not eliminated completely 

from recycled pulp upon purification.

Variations on fibres hydration skills were also studied by capillarity tests. R pulp 

(Figure 4. 9a) demonstrated a strong tendency to increase capillarity when combining the 

beating and UHP steps. The best results were obtained when UHP stage followed the 

beating stage (B-HP and B1-HP-B2), where capillarity increased almost double (e.g. at 

1000 revolutions). These facts were related with increased paper porosity, while subjecting 

pulp to UHP, especially after beating. As known, the capillary forces depend on the liquid-

air surface tension (?), on the cosine of contact angle between liquid and capillary surface 

(cos?), and are reversibly proportional to the radium of the capillary (r). This relationship 

is represented in Equation 4.1, where ? is the density, and g is the acceleration due to 

gravity.

 Chapter IV | The effect of ultra-high pressure on the papermaking properties of pulp 

degradation and impurities content. Therefore, the synergetic effect of UHP and beating, 

promoted the reduction of the negative effects brought by hornification (such as limited 

water uptake, weaker physical/mechanical properties). The variations found on this 

parameter for R samples were, as expected, more substantial, than those found on virgin 

fibres (E and S). 

4.3.5. Effect of UHP conditions on the pulp beating 

4.3.5.1.  Properties 

The physical and mechanical properties were further analysed considering increased 

pressure conditions (500 and 600 MPa) at fixed beating conditions (for R at 1000 PFI 

revolutions, for E at 3000 PFI revolutions and for S at 6000 revolutions). Similar to before 

drainability, bulk, burst index, tensile strength, stretch (%), tear index, air resistance, 

opacity (%) and capillarity were evaluated.  

Results of drainability as function of pressure (ºSR versus pressure), are shown in 

Figure 4. 10a for R samples series. The results revealed that, when pressure was risen, HP-

B sequence displayed always increased beating degree values. Also, B1-HP-B2 sequence 

exhibited increased beating degree values with a maximum at 500 MPa, followed by a 

decrease at 600 MPa. As for B-HP, the decrease already registered at 400 MPa was further 

boosted. These values could be indicative that employing higher pressures could lead 

towards stronger UHP effects on sequence treatments. 

In the case of E samples (Figure 4. 10b), overall higher pressures prompted a small 

and not very significant decrease of beating degree, except for B1-HP-B2, which increased 

at 400 MPa. For 500 MPa and 600 MPa the beating degree values were near those of 

untreated sample or slightly lower. As for HP-B the variations were not significant. 

Similarly, S pulp fibres (Figure 4. 10c) also exhibited lower or similar results to untreated 

pulps, with exception of HP-B at 500 MPa and B1-HP-B2 at 400 MPa.

revolutions), as a function of pressure (0, 400, 500 and 600 MPa, 10 min). 

Bulk was also analysed for pressure conditions between 400 and 600 MPa. In the 

case of R samples series, (Figure 4. 11a), sequences HP-B and B1-HP-B2, from 400MPa to 

500 MPa and 600 MPa, exhibited a small decrease of bulk values, with a minimum at 500 

MPa. At the same time, B-HP sequence did not exhibit significant variations. Also, B-HP 

sequence displayed similar results to untreated pulp. In the case of low bulk values, dense 

handsheets are formed possibly due to an improved fibres plasticity (synergetic effect of 

UHP and beating, as previously discussed). 

As concerns E samples series (Figure 4. 11b), at increased pressure, an increase in 

bulk was found in B-HP sequence and to some extent, in B1-HP-B2 sequence, while in the 

case of sequence HP-B, lower or similar bulk results were registered. It may be claimed, 

again, that the application of UHP stage after the beating step led to the bulk increase 

progressively with pressure. The increases found on bulk are related with UHP aptitude for

 Chapter IV | The effect of ultra-high pressure on the papermaking properties of pulp 

forced hydration and thus fibres enlargement. The same did not occur upon the other 

sequences due to beating as the end stage, of multi-beating stages (B1-HP-B2).  

Similarly to R, S samples series (Figure 4. 11c) also displayed a similar behaviour 

(low bulk values) after UHP treatment, although, in this case, this is not related with the 

damaged structure of fibres.

as a function of pressure (0, 400, 500 and 600 MPa, 10 min). 

The burst index of handsheets produced from refined pulps was also analysed as 

function of pressure. R samples series (Figure 4. 12a), at increased pressure conditions 

(from 400 to 600 MPa), registered either similar or slightly lower variations on burst index. 

Furthermore, E samples (Figure 4. 12b), displayed similar or slightly higher tensile index 

(HP-B and B1-HP-B2 sequences). It seems that the application of UHP stage before 

beating led to bulkier handsheets with improved interfibre bonding. 

In the case of long fibres, S sample series (Figure 4. 12c), here a notable increase in 

burst index was found, meaning that the synergetic effect between beating and UHP was

Tensile strength results of R samples series (Figure 4. 13a), were practically 

insignificantly affected by pressure in UHP step. However, in the case of E samples 

(Figure 4. 13b), for increased pressure conditions, a clear tendency of tensile strength 

increment was observed. The increment was notable when the beating stage followed the 

UHP treatment. This was manifested in HP-B and B1-HP-B2 sequences. This fact 

indicates that UHP promotes the defibration in forthcoming beating operation. Such 

assumption is also valid when UHP is applied intercalary in beating sequence. In the case 

of S fibres series, the variations in strength were the most significant. The beating applied

revolutions), as a function of pressure (0, 400, 500 and 600 MPa, 10 min). 

The increase of pressure in UHP processing of all kind of fibres (pulps R, E and S) 

within all beating sequences led to the sustainable increase in stretch (Figure 4. 14). This 

fact may be explained by the enhanced forced hydration of pulp fibres, making them 

elastic, thus increasing the handsheet deformation to ultimate tensile.

Results on tear index from recycled fibres (R samples series), and its values are 

depicted in Figure 4. 15a. In fact, no significant changes were found within the range of 

pressures used in different heating sequences containing UHP stages. This result is similar 

to burst and strength characteristics discussed before (Figures 4. 12 and 4. 13). This fact 

may be explained by the fact that paper network improvements gained, by implementing 

UHP treatment, were minimized by the frailer structure of recycled fibres that limited its 

intrinsic properties.

revolutions), as a function of pressure (0, 400, 500 and 600 MPa, 10 min). 

In contrast to recycled fibres, virgin ones demonstrated improvements in tear 

resistance while increasing the processing pressure in UHP stages (Figure 4. 15), thought 

these improvements were not so straightforward. Thus, E samples series (Figure 4. 15b), 

showed a decrease of tear resistance in HP-B and B-HP sequences and similar values in the 

range of 400-600 MPa. In contrast, softwood fibres series, S, displayed higher tear values, 

while increasing the pressure from 400 to 600 MPa in UHP stage, with exception of 600 

MPa for HP-B (Figure 4. 15c). The different trend displayed by softwood fibres, relatively 

to the other fibres, could be attributed to softwood fibres dimensions (long fibres) and 

morphologies. In this case the synergetic effect of UHP treatment and beating may have 

contributed sharply to improve inter-fibres bonding.

and S=6000 revolutions), as a function of pressure (0, 400, 500 and 600 MPa, 10 min). 

Gurley’s air resistance data for R samples series are presented in Figure 4. 16a. In 

general, air resistance increased, while increasing the pressure in UHP stage. The 

exception was detected with B-HP sequence only, which showed a decrease in air 

resistance, in the pressures range of 400-600MPa. The low air resistance values presume a 

porous handsheet and thus more free spaces between fibres. The increase of air resistance 

with increasing pressure in UHP stages, although not superior to untreated samples, 

reflects the fibres enlargement and, thus, the appearance of larger spaces between fibres in 

handsheets. 

The decrease of air resistance was also found for virgin fibres, E and S series 

(Figures 4. 16b and c, respectively), with emphasis on sequences B1-HP-B2 and B-HP. It

In the case of opacity (%) (Figure 4. 17), a decrease in recycled pulp treated by the 

beating sequences, with increasing of pressure in UHP stage, may be associated with some 

decrease of bulk (Figure 4. 11). Hardwood fibres, E, series (Figure 4. 17b) displayed a 

similar behaviour, with lower opacities from 500MPa onwards. In case of softwood fibres 

(Figure 4. 17c) increased opacities were achieved in sequences B-HP and B1-HP-B2, 

where the UHP stage was applied after the beating step. The reverse dependence was 

found in HP-B sequence, which corroborates with bulk dependence from pressure in UHP 

stage, as discussed previously (Figure 4. 11).

Capillarity tests revealed almost continuous increase of water absorptivity with the 

increase of pressures in UHP stages. However, in the case of short fibres (R and E) 

capillarity increased insignificantly in the pressure range from 500 to 600 MPa, whereas in 

the case of long fibres the capillarity increment was still notable. It seems that the pressure 

of 500 MPa was the best from the point of view of pulp absorptivity for the recycled fibres.

The remarkable improvements found on the absorptivity of fibres hydration skill 

(Figure 4. 18) are the results of the synergetic effect of UHP (stronger for increased 

pressures) with beating. As previously mentioned, capillarity is influenced by fibres 

porosity, and according to Young-Laplace equation, by liquid-air surface tension, cosine of 

contact angle and the inverse of capillaries radium. Therefore, in the formed handsheets, 

considering these facts and the improvement of porosity and hydrophilicity, as result of

 Chapter IV | The effect of ultra-high pressure on the papermaking properties of pulp 

UHP treatment, it is probable that together these might have contributed to improve 

handsheets absorptivity, especially upon higher pressures (stronger UHP effect). 

4.3.5.2.  Fibre morphology analysis 

 The effect of different pressures in UHP treatment on fibres morphologies was 

performed at pressure values ranging from 400 to 600 MPa, at fixed beating conditions (at 

1000 PFI revolutions for R, at 3000 PFI revolutions for E and at 6000 PFI revolutions for 

S). The data for recycled fibres is displayed in Table 4. 4, while virgin fibres results are 

shown in Table 4. 5. 

 For the pressures as high as 400 MPa, no decrease in fibres length was detected in 

any beating sequence conjugated with UHP steps. This means that internal and external 

fibrillation were predominant over shortening. Such result may be due to improved fibres 

hydration, with increased pressure in UHP treatment that affected the plasticity of fibres, 

thus becoming less prone to shortening. Coarseness of fibres was clearly decreased, while 

increasing the pressure in UHP stage, in all beating sequences, indicating an improve fibre 

wall fibrillation/dilapidation. The mean kin index values were either similar to those of 400 

MPa or higher, suggesting enhanced fibres deformation, possibly resultant from a 

decreased coarseness. 

Table 4. 4 - Fibres characteristics, for non-treated R pulps and R pulps subjected to beating sequences HP-B, B-HP and 

B1-HP-B2, at fixed beating conditions and at different pressures in UHP stage (400, 500 and 600 MPa).

As concerns virgin fibres, E and S, series (Table 4. 5), its length was not 

substantially affected in beating sequences, with increasing pressure (over 400 MPa). This 

result is in agreement with an intact fibre walls in virgin pulps, in opposite to recycled 

fibres (damaged and previously beaten fibres). In the case of E samples, no changes in 

coarseness were observed with an increase of pressures in UHP stages. As a rule, mean 

kink index was decreased in sequences with the UHP stage after beating (B-HP and B1-

HP-B2), when pressures raised from 400 to 600 MPa.

Similar tendencies, as with hardwood pulp E, were obtained with softwood pulp, S, 

(Table 4. 5), thought the decrease of mean kink index was observed only after B-HP 

sequence in the pressure range of 400-600 MPa. 

The differences in coarseness dependences in different beating sequences of 

recycled (R) and similar by nature virgin (E) pulp may be assigned to fibres morphologies. 

Thus, recycled fibres are strongly damaged and practically have no primary cell wall, 

whereas virgin fibres possess an intact cell wall. This fact predetermines the easier 

expansion of secondary wall in R than in E. Hence, mechanical peeling of the formers is 

relatively fast. This explains the coarseness decrease in R with increased pressures in UHP 

stage and it low variation with pressure in E.

 Chapter IV | The effect of ultra-high pressure on the papermaking properties of pulp 

4.4. Conclusions 

The results of this study revealed the effect of UHP treatment on papermaking 

properties of both recycled (R) and virgin hardwood (E) and softwood (S) pulps. The 

forced hydration of fibres upon UHP treatment, in general, favours the defibration in 

subsequent beating stages, which, however, was not necessary reflected by the formal 

increasing of beating degree (ºSR). This was particularly notable when UHP stage was 

applied after the beating stage (B-HP sequence). Recycled pulp showed the highest 

increase in formally determined pulp beatability (up to twice) in the B1-HP-B2 beating 

sequence (pre-beating followed by UHP step and posterior beating stage). These 

improvements in beating were fairly moderated in the case of virgin pulps (E and S). The 

increase of pressure in UHP treatment from 400 to 500 or 600 MPa led to the acceleration 

of beating in the case of recycled fibres, especially in the HP-B sequence (UHP pre-

treatment stage followed by beating), and to moderate or negligible beating improvement 

in the case of virgin pulps. The observed differences in UHP effect of beating behaviour 

for recycled and virgin fibre were explained by different fibre morphologies (intact or 

degraded primary cell walls). 

The improved beating of both recycled and virgin fibres was not always transformed 

into the improvement of strength properties of refined pulps. This fact was related to the 

forced hydration of fibres leading to their increased elasticity and some decreased bonding 

capacity, due to the smaller overlapping of fibres (less interfibrillar surface) and 

diminished amount of free groups (part of OH groups are involved in water clathrates). 

Physical properties were improved to some extent, while increasing the hydraulic pressure 

in UHP treatment from 400 to 500 or 600 MPa. The improvements depended from pulp 

origin and were minimal for recycled pulp and maximal for virgin softwood pulp (from 10 

to 20%). Optimal pressures in UHP step depended of pulp origins and beating sequences 

applied. 

The combination of UHP treatment and beating in various combinations allowed 

improvements of pulp handsheets opacity and capillarity. The highest improvement of 

capillarity was found for recycled and virgin softwood pulps, (more than twice), which was 

always enhanced by increasing of pressure in UHP stage. 

It may be also concluded that the best desired properties of papers will be dependent 

on pulps origin and the beating sequence applied under particularly optimised conditions. 

Overall, UHP treatment may be an interesting tool to improve recycled and virgin pulps 

performance in the production of tissue papers.

 Chapter V | Effect of ultra-high pressure on enzymatic modification of recycled pulp 

5.1. Introduction 

The production of recycled paper has grown all over the world.
[1,2]

 This increase was 

essentially driven by political issues, consumer’s demands and environmental awareness. 

Nowadays nearly 30-50% of cellulosic fibres are recycled worldwide and its consumption 

offers several advantages. Its use in papermaking contributes to reducing the depletion of 

forest resources and to decrease energy and water consumption.
[3–5]

 However, several 

disadvantages can still be associated with recycled paper. The main problems are related to 

(i) the feedstock variability, (ii) significant losses on fibres strength properties due to 

hornification, and (iii) the presence of impurities (such as inks, glues, stickies, etc.).
[6,7]

 

Yet, hornification is still considered the main responsible for the losses of recycled pulp 

strength properties. It occurs as results of the stressful conditions fibres are submitted, 

repeatedly, during their lifecycle (pressing and drying during paper production, re-pulping 

ageing, etc.). These factors contribute to irreversible changes in fibres structure, yielding 

its surface collapse, shrinkage, stiffening and limited swelling in water.
[8–10]

 As result, 

recycled pulps strength decreases considerably, which limits its re-use in papermaking. In 

truth, it is almost impossible to use 100% recycled fibres in paper composition without the 

addition of a significant proportion of virgin pulp. Additionally, the number of re-using 

cycles of recycled pulp is limited to 3-5.
[3–5]

 In order to improve recycled fibres 

performance, different approaches may be followed, being the most conventional chemical 

treatments (swelling with alkaline solutions) and reactive refining (beating with enzymes 

aid or some inorganic bases/salts) in water. 
[6,8,11–13]

 

Enzymes have been recognised as an environmentally friendly solution in fibre 

modification. These act selectively on fibres constituents, improving its strength properties 

and promoting the inter-fibre bonding in paper.
[14,15]

 In what concerns recycled fibres, its 

treatment with some hydrolytic enzymes enables improved removal of ink and other 

impurities, while retaining fibres properties, as much as possible.
[16]

 Enzymes such as 

cellulases, hemicellulases, amylases, and lipases could be used separately or in 

conjunction, depending on the type of waste paper and impurities, to optimize the 

purification process. Generally, enzymatic treatment occurs either by attacking the ink or 

the fibre surface on the fibre-ink interface. Thus, lipases and esterases degrade vegetable 

oil-based inks, while pectinases, hemicellulases, cellulases and ligninolytic enzymes alter 

the fibre surface or the bond close to ink particles, hence releasing ink for removal.
[7,14,17]

 Chapter V | Effect of ultra-high pressure on enzymatic modification of recycled pulp 

Xylan is a major hemicellulose in hardwood pulps, which can be selectively 

depolymerized by xylanase. This property was successfully used for both hardwood kraft 

pulps bleaching or upgrading to dissolving pulps.
[15,18,19]

 By breaking the covalent linkages 

between xylose residues, xylanase is able to hydrolyse xylan into leachable 

oligosaccharides. The removal of xylan oligosaccharides, together with substituted 

hemicelluloses and covalently linked lignin, from the fibre surface, results in improved 

bleaching, also due to the enhanced penetration of bleaching agents. 
[20,21]

 The use of 

xylanases for the treatment of recycled pulps is much less studied than with other 

enzymatic systems.
[14]

 

Ultra-high hydrostatic pressure (UHP) treatment is a relatively new technique, which 

has demonstrated the ability to reverse the limitations laid on recycled fibres by 

hornification due to forced hydration and introduction of strongly bound water in pulp.
[22]

 

UHP treatment prompts rearrangements to the fibre structure, which increase accessibility 

towards chemicals and enzymes.
[22–24]

 

Considering the aforementioned, the main goal of this study was to evaluate the 

effect of selective modification of recycled pulp by xylanase, also promoted by UHP pre-

treatment, on the strength properties of recycled pulp. It is noteworthy that the studies 

described in this chapter were published and are thus available for viewing in a journal 

article entitled “High pressure-promoted xylanase treatment to enhance papermaking 

properties of recycled pulp”.

5.2. Materials and Methods 

Recycled pulp, R, and eucalyptus globulus bleached kraft industrial pulp, E, (from 

the same lots used in the previous chapters) were kindly supplied by Renova FPA, S.A. 

and used on the studies performed on this chapter. The enzyme applied in pulp treatments 

was commercial endo-?-1,4-xylanase (E.C.# 3.2.1.4; enzyme activity of 2.5 AUX/mg) 

from Thermomyces lanuginosus (X2753 from Novozymes Basionics®).  

5.2.1. Neutral sugar analysis  

Neutral sugar analysis was performed following the same methodology described in 

Chapter 3, section 3.2.1.7. 

5.2.2. Hydrostatic ultra high-pressure treatment (UHP) 

Pulp dispersions (2% consistency) of R or E, were prepared with sodium acetate 

buffer solution (0.05 M sodium acetate buffer at pH 5) and placed into HDPE flasks. 

Afterwards, the flasks containing the pulp dispersions were subjected to UHP treatment, at 

different pressure conditions (300, 400, 500 and 600 MPa, for 10 min) on a high-pressure 

apparatus, model 55 Hyperbaric (Burgos, Spain), under aqueous medium. 

5.2.3. Enzymatic hydrolysis 

? Sodium acetate hydrate (99%, Panreac) 

? Glacial Acetic acid (99.7%, Fluka ) 

? Distilled water 

The enzymatic hydrolysis was performed according to the following procedure, 1g of 

dry pulp was dispersed in 50 ml of 0.05 M sodium acetate buffer. In the case of UHP 

treated samples, after UHP those were diluted up for 50 mL. Afterwards, pulp dispersions 

were placed in a round-bottom flask, under stirring, at 40 ºC. A suspension of enzyme (0.5 

ml of a 4 mg/ml solution, 5 AUX/g pulp), prepared in advance, was them added to the 

stirring pulp dispersion and allowed to react for 75 min. Aliquots for reducing sugars (RS) 

analysis were collected at 2, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 75 min and analysed using 3,5-

dinitrosalicilic acid (DNS) method.
[26]

 The pulp samples used to produce paper sheets were 

treated under the same conditions and enzymatic load.

5.2.4. Reducing sugar quantification (DNS method) 

? 3,5 – Dinitrosalicylic acid, DNS (98%, Merk) 

? NaOH (97%, Acros Organic) 

? Potassium sodium tartrate (99%, Acros Organics) 

? Glucose (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) 

? Distilled water 

The DNS method
[26]

 was used to monitor the amount of RS released during the 

enzymatic reaction. Firstly, the DNS reactant was prepared. To do it a 2 M NaOH solution 

was prepared by dissolving 8 g of NaOH on 100 ml of water, under stirring and heating. At 

the same time, a solution of potassium sodium tartrate was prepared by dissolving 150 g of 

this reactant with 250 ml of distilled water. When the NaOH solution (under stirring and 

heating) reached approximately 100 ºC, 5 g of DNS were added. Afterwards, when the 

mixture approached approximately 60 ºC, the tartrate solution was added. The mixture was 

left stirring until all DNS was dissolved. Then it was cooled down and stored. 

To quantify the produced RS, 0.5 mL of a filtered aliquot (in duplicate), collected 

during the enzymatic reactions, was added into o soviril tube. After adding 1 ml of DNS, 

the tube was closed and placed under boiling water (100 ºC) for 5 min. The sample was 

then placed on ice to cool down and diluted by adding 10 ml of distilled water. 

The quantification was carried out on a UV-Vis spectrophotometer, Evolution 220 

from Thermo Scientific at 540 nm. To all absorbance values, it was subtracted the value of 

the blank, which consisted of buffer solution subjected to the same procedure of samples. 

The calibration curve for RS quantification was performed by applying the described 

method to glucose standard solutions of 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1, 2 and 3 mg/mL of concentration. 

From their absorbance values and concentration values, a calibration curve was achieved 

and is presented in Appendices C. 

5.2.5. Handsheets formation 

To evaluate the physical and mechanical properties of pulp samples, handsheets were 

prepared following ISO 5269-2:2004, on a Rapid- Köthen sheet former (Karl Schröder 

KG). 

5.2.6. Physical and mechanical properties evaluation

handsheets (section 5.2.5.) were evaluated according to ISO 534:2011. Tensile strength, 

stretch, tear index, burst index, air resistance (Gurley method) were evaluated following 

ISO 1924-2:2008, ISO 1974:2012, ISO 2758:2014 and ISO 5636-5:2013, respectively. 

Brightness and fluorescence of hand sheets were determined following ISO 2470-1:2009, 

using an Elrepho brightness tester (Lorentzen &amp;amp; Wettre). Water retention value (WRV) 

was determined by centrifuge method based on a procedure developed by Jayme (1958).
[27]

 

 

5.2.7. Xylan removal yield 

The xylan removal yield was monitored considering changes on the neutral sugar 

contents (shifts on xylose content) and the weight loss registered for each sample after each 

treatment. 

Variations on mass were also followed. With this purpose a microporous filter (no.3) 

was weighted before the reaction, then it was used to filter the reaction medium and, after 

dried along with the filtrate at 105 ºC (until 0% HR), was weighted again. 

The formula used to calculate the yield is given by equation 4.1. 

????? (%) =

  Equation 4. 1 

5.2.8. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 

Pulp samples were also analysed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), on 

a Hitachi S4100 equipment at 15 kV. Each sample was attached to a SEM support with 

carbon tape, then subjected to Au/Pd sputtering before analysis.

 Chapter V | Effect of ultra-high pressure on enzymatic modification of recycled pulp 

5.3. Results and Discussion 

The effect of UHP on xylanase hydrolysis and modification of recycled fibres, R, 

was studied. Since chemical analysis (Chapter 3, section 3.3.1.) showed similarities 

between the chemical composition of the selected recycled fibres (R) and virgin eucalypt 

pulp (E), this last may simulate pulp R, before its involvement in the papermaking process. 

Hence, E pulp was used here as non-processed virgin fibres for comparative reasons.  

5.3.1. Effect of UHP pre-treatment on the enzymatic treatment of pulp  

5.3.1.1. Reducing sugars release 

E and R samples were subjected to UHP pre-treatment under different conditions (0, 

300, 400, 500 and 600 MPa, during 10 min) and, after that, were treated with xylanase at 

40ºC during 75 min. The removal of xylan, by enzymatic hydrolysis, was monitored by the 

release of reducing sugars (RS), according to the DNS method.
[26]

 The RS release profiles 

are displayed in Figure 5. 1 (recycled fibres) and Figure 5. 2 (virgin fibres). For simplicity, 

each sample was labelled as described below. R consists of recycled fibres sample, without 

UHP pre-treatment and subjected to enzymatic treatment. The other recycled fibres 

samples of recycled fibres subjected to UHP pre-treatment and enzymatic hydrolysis, were 

labelled as “RXXX”, where “XXX” corresponds to the pressure applied during the UHP 

pre-treatment (300, 400, 500 or 600MPa). The same labelling method was used for virgin 

fibres, being E the pulp sample without UHP pre-treatment and subjected to enzymatic 

treatment, while “EXXX” samples consist of pulp samples subjected to both UHP pre-

treatment and enzymatic hydrolysis.

 Chapter V | Effect of ultra-high pressure on enzymatic modification of recycled pulp 

In both types of fibres (recycled and virgin fibres), the increase of RS release was 

observed for samples subjected to UHP pre-treatment, with a sudden rise at ca. 10min. In 

opposite, pulps not treated by UHP revealed a slower and continuous release of RS. 

Furthermore, it was found that RS release profiles depended on the pressure conditions 

applied. 

As regards R (without UHP pre-treatment), this sample released the lowest RS, upon 

enzymatic hydrolysis, followed by R300 (recycled fibres treated at 300MPa). Even though 

R500 (recycled fibres treated at 500MPa) and R600 (recycled fibres treated at 600MPa) 

also exhibited a higher RS release, when compared with R and R300, it was R400 

(recycled fibres treated with 400MPa) the one displaying the highest RS release (Figure 5. 

1). Thus, as showed by RS release, xylan partial removal was promoted by UHP pre-

treatment.  

Xylan removal was particularly fast during the first 2min of enzymatic hydrolysis, 

then further xylan removal from fibre cell wall occurred slowly, especially for pulp fibres 

untreated by UHP (R). These features can be explained by the easy hydrolysis of xylan 

from fibres surface, whereas the accessibility of interior layer in fibres was significantly 

reduced. Nevertheless, even recycled pulp untreated by UHP, R, demonstrated a weak 

growth of RS release till 60min of enzymatic hydrolysis. This fact may be explained by the 

improved accessibility of beaten R, already used in papermaking, due to the mechanical 

damage/defibration of the fibre cell wall.  

In the case of virgin hardwood fibres, used for comparative reasons, samples 

subjected to UHP pre-treatment also revealed an increase of RS release, though maximum 

RS concentrations in hydrolysates were registered after 500MPa pre-treatment and not 

after 400MPa, as in the case of recycled fibres (Figure 5. 2). The maximum rate of xylan 

removal was associated with the maximum efficiency of enzyme promoted fibre 

modification, with respect to surface purification and accessibility. Xylan removal from E 

(monitored by RS release) was stagnant after 10min of enzymatic hydrolysis, possibly due 

to hindered accessibility to intact cell wall if virgin fibres (unbeaten fibres).  

Although, in both cases, recycled and virgin pulps showed an improved accessibility 

to xylanase, after the UHP pre-treatment, the maximum xylan removal was observed for R 

and E, under different hydrostatic pressures. Thus, the highest xylan hydrolysis for R was 

observed after UHP pre-treatment at 400MPa and at 500MPa for E. The UHP treatment 

leads to forced hydration of cellulosic fibrils in the pulp and to the disaggregation of 



 

~ 172 ~ 

 

 Chapter V | Effect of ultra-high pressure on enzymatic modification of recycled pulp 

microfibrils (bundle of fibrils), thus opening the inter-microfibrillar space for enzymatic 

attack on the xylan that envelops the cellulose microfibril (Figure 5. 3).
[24]

  

Along the UHP pre-treatment in time or when increasing the hydrostatic pressure, the 

forced hydration of fibrils inside cellulose microfibrils proceeds, thus decreasing the space 

between microfibrils due to its enlargement. As a consequence, the accessibility of xylan in 

inter-microfibrillar space is diminishing. Apparently, the partially disintegrated cell wall of 

R fibres requires less severe hydrostatic pressure to disaggregate cellulose microfibrils than 

the intact cell wall of E fibres. 

 

Figure 5. 3 - Schematic representation of the effect of ultra-high hydrostatic pressure (UHP) treatment on the 

improvement of fibre cell wall accessibility towards xylanase (ENZ). Forced hydration favours the disaggregation of 

microfibrils (MCF) and elementary fibrils (EF), thus improving the accessibility of xylan (X) in the inter-microfibrillar 

space. 

It was also suggested that the presence of cellulases in the supplied xylanases was 

insignificant because no decrease was found in the intrinsic viscosity of pulp, after the 

enzymatic treatment. In contrast, a small increase it was found from 925cm
3
/g (Chapter 3, 

Table 3.3) to 940cm
3
/g, due to partial elimination of relatively low molecular weight xylan. 

5.3.1.2. Physical/Mechanical properties 

Considering the optimum UHP treatment conditions for cellulosic pulps, R 

(400MPa) and E (500MPa), hand sheets from its corresponding pulps were prepared to 

evaluate the effect of the combination of UHP pre-treatment and enzymatic treatment 

(R400E and E500E, respectively). Additionally, for comparison both pulp without any 

treatment (R and E) and those treated solely with enzymes (RE and EE, respectively) or 

solely pre-treated by UHP treatment (RHP and EHP) were also considered (Table 5. 1 and 

5.2).

* The variation (?%) of each property was determined with respect to the parent pulp R. 

Overall, xylanase treatment enhanced strength properties of recycled pulp (Table 5. 

1). In the case of recycled fibres solely treated with xylanase (RE), most of the physical 

properties were improved, which were further boosted upon UHP treatment (R400E). 

Although UHP pre-treatment itself did not improve significantly the physical properties of 

R (RHP), UHP certainly had a synergistic effect on those properties when combined with 

posterior enzymatic treatment. This is especially notable for tensile strength and the tear 

resistance, as evidenced from analyses on RE and R400E, which were improved up to 

30%. The air resistance was also superior for enzyme-treated pulp demonstrating paper 

structure closure due to improved fibre-fibre interaction. Such features may be related both 

to the enhanced accessibility of R fibres towards xylanase and by forced hydration and 

favourable rearrangement of cellulosic fibrils in fibres after UHP pre-treatment. As it was 

previously suggested, UHP treatment leads to disaggregation of fibrils by forced hydration 

of their surface and to rearrangements of cellulose fibrils, leading to crystallite aggregation 

and diminishing of the distortion of their surfaces.
[22]

 All these changes promote the fibre 

bonding capacity and increased intrinsic fibre strength. UHP treatment of cellulosic fibres 

also leads to the increase of strongly bound water in pulp, thus diminishing its 

susceptibility to hornification.
[22]

 

The significantly increased drainability of enzyme-modified pulp (RE) evidenced for 

the improved swelling capacity of recycled pulp, though this was not accompanied by the 

increasing of WRVs due to the removal of hydrophilic xylan from pulp. It is suggested that 



 

~ 174 ~ 

 

 Chapter V | Effect of ultra-high pressure on enzymatic modification of recycled pulp 

the partial removal of xylan, bound to impurities and to cellulose fibrils, on the surface of 

recycled pulp, would favour the ensuing swelling and inter-fibre bonding of purified R 

fibres in handsheets. This is a reason for the notable improvement of mechanical properties 

of R, after the enzymatic treatment (Table 5. 1). The increased drainability, after the 

enzymatic treatment, indicates that RE might possess much better refinability than the 

initial R (Table 5. 1). This is an attractive point for economic manufacture of paper from 

recycled fibres since the energy costs for pulp refining are the main expensive item of 

paper production. 

In contrast to strength parameters, a small decrease in recycled pulp brightness was 

observed after enzymatic treatment. These features are also demonstrated by reflectance 

spectra of paper sheets in the range of 200-450nm (Figure 5. 4). The decrease in recycled 

pulp reflection at 475nm was correlated with the loss of calcium carbonate filler, under 

weakly acidic conditions, after the enzymatic treatments. In parallel tests it was observed 

that when pulp R was treated solely with buffer (pH 5), the reflection at 475nm would 

decrease nearly 1.2%. From the other side, the decrease in R brightness after enzymatic 

treatment may also be explained by the eventual removal of optical brightening agents 

(OBAs) present in printing papers. This fact was evidenced by the detected decrease in 

fluorescence R457 of the treated recycled pulp (Table 5. 1). The removal of OBAs is a 

typical feature for recycled pulps modified by enzymatic treatment.
[28,29]

 However, the 

unexpected increase of K/S in the UV-vis DR spectra range of 220-350nm from R to RE 

and further to R400E (Figure 5. 4) was possibly the result of detachment of impurities 

(printing inks, auxiliary resins, etc) not only from the surface but also from the bulk of 

fibres, which under the treatment conditions, formed small dispersed particles that re-

adsorbed further on fibre surface. Such explanation was suggested in previous studies on 

the enzymatically promoted deinking of recycled pulps.
[29,30]

 According to literature,
[30]

 the 

enzymatic treatment of alkaline paper (formed at pH 8-9) under weak acidic conditions, 

usually leads to the appearance of floating microparticles of toner/ink liberated as the result 

of its release from degraded calcium carbonate particles and inaccessible fibre surface. 

These ink microparticles tend to re-precipitate on fibres in the absence of appropriate 

surfactants, thus decreasing the pulp brightness. Apparently, forced hydration of pulp upon 

UHP treatment facilitates not only the enzyme penetration inside the cellulosic fibres, but 

also the detachment of impurities from the surface. This explains the highest increase of 

K/S in the UV-vis DR spectrum of R400E, which is in agreement with a more pronounced 

enzymatic accessibility of pulp, due to UHP pre-treatment (Figure 5. 1).

*The variation (?%) of each property was determined with respect to the parent pulp E. 

For comparison, the same enzymatic treatment was also applied to E fibres (virgin 

hardwood fibres). Similar to R pulp, enzymatic treatment of pulp E led to a significant 

improvement of pulp strength properties being the most noticeable tensile strength and tear 

index. Again, it was found that pulp samples subjected to enzymatic treatment after UHP 

(E500E) exhibited much better results than those without UHP pre-treatment (EE). The 

relative improvement of strength properties for virgin pulp, observed after the UHP pre-

treatment followed by enzymatic hydrolysis (E500E), was even higher than that for the 

recycled pulp after the same treatments (R400E). (Figure 5. 2). This can be explained, at 



 

~ 176 ~ 

 

 Chapter V | Effect of ultra-high pressure on enzymatic modification of recycled pulp 

least partially, by the higher strength of virgin pulp fibres, comparatively to recycled ones, 

due to the less degraded pulp polysaccharides in the former. In fact, the intrinsic viscosity 

of E was almost twice to R (Chapter 3, Table 3.3). 

Nevertheless, in relative terms, UHP pre-treatment was more advantageous for pulp 

R, than for pulp E. At the same time, unlike pulp R, UHP did not affect the drainability of 

pulp E (Table 5. 2). This may be explained, from one side by moderate enzymatic 

hydrolysis of virgin pulp and from the other side, by difficulties in swelling of fibres with 

intact primary cell walls.
[31]

 Nevertheless, the WRV of E subjected to enzymatic treatment 

increased remarkably, thus indicating the enhanced internal swelling of pulp fibres. Also, 

in opposite to pulp R, an enzymatic treatment of pulp E showed a small increase in pulp 

brightness (ca. 0.5% ISO) and no changes in fluorescence R457 (Table 5. 2). 

5.3.1.3. SEM 

The changes in pulp fibre morphology due to the enzymatic treatment, with and 

without UHP pre-treatment, were evaluated by image analysis using SEM. Figure 5. 5 

displays the SEM images acquired from samples R, RE and R400E, while Figure 5. 6 

exhibits the SEM images of samples E, EE and E500E.  

The images of recycled fibres, R, (Figure 5. 5a) exhibited damaged/defibrillated cell 

walls, which confirms that fibres from recycled pulp were previously beaten in 

papermaking, as proposed in section 5.3.1.1. 

The effect of xylanase on fibres can be observed when comparing R (Figure 5. 5a) 

with RE (Figure 5. 5b) and E (Figure 5. 6a) with EE (Figure 5. 6b). The external 

fibrillation of fibres induced by xylanase was visualised, as well as the diminishing of 

fibre surface collapse, especially for the recycled pulp. Visually, enzymatically treated 

fibres are better intertwined and possess higher contact areas than non-treated fibres. This 

becomes even more noticeable when comparing enzymatically modified fibres without 

(RE and EE) and with UHP pre-treatment (R500E and E400E) (Figure 5. 5c and Figure 

5. 6c, respectively).

5.3.1.4. Xylan removal yield 

The extent of xylan removal from pulps upon xylanase treatment (from R to RE and 

R400E and from E to EE and E500E) was also evaluated (Table 5. 4). In Table 5. 3 are 

presented the compositions of neutral sugars in the analysed samples, which were then 

used to determine the yield of xylan removal. 

Table 5. 3– Neutral sugar composition of non-treated samples (R and E) samples treated solely with xylanase (RE and 

EE) and samples subjected to the combinations of UHP pre-treatment and xylanase treatment (R400E and E500E).

R400E - 16.9±0.1 - - 83.1±0.1 

E - 24.6±0.4 - - 75.4±0.5 

EE - 22.3±0.4 - - 77.7±0.4 

E500E - 21.6±0.3 - - 78.4±0.3

combination of UHP pre-treatment and xylanase (R400E and E500E).

RE 23.4±2.0 

R400E 26.1±2.0 

EE 10.1±0.6 

E500E 12.2±0.6 

In all cases, with both pulps, UHP pre-treatment boosted the extent of xylan 

enzymatic hydrolysis by 10-20% (R400E and E500E). The amount of xylan removed from 

the recycled pulp was roughly twice of that observed for the virgin pulp, which can be 

explained by the higher accessibility of the former, due to structural disintegration of fibres 

after beating during paper production and because of paper life cycle (e.g. abrasion, folding 

and ageing).

 Chapter V | Effect of ultra-high pressure on enzymatic modification of recycled pulp 

5.4. Conclusions 

The employment of UHP pre-treatment on recycled fibres allowed an improved 

removal of xylan in a xylanase-catalysed treatment. UHP pre-treatment promoted forced 

hydration of fibrils and the disaggregation of microfibrils, which ensued the opening of 

inter-fibrillar space for enzymatic attack. Due to improved accessibility enzymes were able 

to remove xylan more efficiently. This was demonstrated for both recycled and virgin 

fibres, for comparison, in terms of reducing sugars release and mass balance.  

Moreover, although both fibres showed improved enzymatic accessibility the 

optimum pressure condition of UHP pre-treatment were different (400MPa for R and 

500MPa for E). It was suggested that due to the damaged cell wall of R, this last required 

less severe hydrostatic pressure to disaggregate cellulose microfibrils than E (unbeaten 

virgin fibres with intact cell wall). 

It was also demonstrated that the partial removal of xylan enabled the improvement 

of strength properties on both pulps, which were further improved when pulps were pre-

treated by UHP treatment (more efficient enzymatic hydrolysis). Also, recycled fibres 

improved drainability suggest a better refinability, which is indicative of energy savings, as 

regards pulp refining in papermaking. 

The results achieved also demonstrated the importance of pH conditions, close to 

neutral, during the enzymatic treatment. It was found that this was important to avoid the 

dissolution of fillers such as calcium carbonate, and thus avoid a decrease in brightness. 

Nevertheless, UHP pre-treatment revealed a favoured elimination of concomitant 

impurities, such as OBA, residual inks and auxiliary reagents in recycled pulp. However, 

under the treatment conditions (mild acidic pH without surfactants) the re-precipitation of 

impurities together with the loss of OBAs contributed for the decrease of recycled fibres 

brightness. Which was not the case of virgin pulp (increase of ca 0.5% ISO). 

As main conclusion, it is suggested that the modification of hardwood-purified 

bleached recycled pulp by xylanase treatment was a very efficient tool for improving its 

papermaking properties. However, further studies are required on the development of 

papermaking properties during beating of the recycled pulp subjected to enzymatic 

treatment at variable xylanase loads, including the use of industrially produced enzymes 

and on the evaluation of economic feasibility of recycled pulp modification by 

UHP/enzymatic treatment.

 Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes 

6.1. Introduction 

The competition in tissue paper market has stimulated the development of new 

products, more appealing to consumer, such as coloured papers. This approach of 

appealing to consumer’s senses, by using a colour coding, or as a way of brand 

identification,
[1,2]

 has led companies, such as Renova, to differentiate themselves from 

competition, for example in tissue paper market (e.g. Renova black toilet paper). The class 

of chemicals responsible for conferring colour to papers are dyes. This ancient class of 

additives are employed not only in paper industry, but also, and at a much larger scale, on 

textiles. 
[1–3]

 Dyes account for 5% of the specialty chemicals applied to paper. These 

colourants are added to paper stock at the preparation stage, to produce distinguished 

coloured papers.
[1,2,4]

 

The selection of a suitable dye for paper coloration depends, for instance, on its end-

use requirements, physical and chemical properties, and handling characteristics. Paper 

dyeing aims to produce paper with a desired colour or shade, although the dyeing process 

itself can be a rather complex one. 
[1,2]

 Several issues arise during pulp dyeing, some 

related with the interference of process variables, when dyes react differently with different 

furnishes, or due to the interaction of dyes with other additives (mostly by electrostatic 

interaction). 
[1,2,5]

 At the same time, some other parameters should be taken into 

consideration. For example, the fastness properties, which are of utter importance for high 

quality writing or tissue papers (e.g. paper in contact with food should exhibit insignificant 

or non-existent bleeding). Other properties include light fastness properties, toxicity and 

the environmental impact of the dyed product. 
[2]

 

In paper dyeing, direct dyes (anionic and cationic) as well as acidic and basic are the 

most widely used. Nevertheless, direct dyes occupy a central role in paper dying.
[1,4,6,7]

 

During the dying process dyes penetrate into fibres and interact with them. Considering the 

type of dyes, the established bonds may be intermolecular hydrogen interactions or 

electrostatic interactions. A dye molecule may also be precipitated on the fibre surface. In 

case of anionic direct dyes (used by Renova), those may interact with cellulosic fibres 

through Van der Wall forces and hydrogen bonds. Also, the aggregation ability with fibres 

may play a central role on the dye fixation. Due to the anionic nature of both direct anionic 

dyes and cellulose, in most cases a fixative agent (e.g. cationic fixatives) is used to enhance 

dye fixation (dye adsorption on fibres), in order to achieve an efficient dyeing process. 

An efficient dye fixation is a rather relevant issue in coloured tissue paper 

production, since it is translated not only into a strongly coloured product (higher

 Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes 

retention/fixation), but also in the product fastness properties and effluents managements 

(coloured backwaters, increased chemical oxygen demand, etc.). 
[1,4,5]

 

Ultra-high pressure technology (UHP) emerges here as a potential prospective 

technology, to improve the dyeing of cellulosic fibres due to improved accessibility. The 

structural changes induced on fibres by UHP treatment, such as, disaggregation of 

microfibrils and forced hydration should increase accessible surface and diminish zeta 

potential of fibrils (two factors favouring dye fixation). The improved accessibility on 

cellulosic fibres has been demonstrated, in previous studies, towards chemicals and 

enzymes.
[8–10]

 With this in mind, this study was focused on application of UHP treatment 

in the impregnation of fibres with dyes, commonly used by Renova for the tissue paper, 

and limiting the coloured paper production. The effect of dye fixation/retention, along with 

its fastness properties (namely bleedfastness) were evaluated.

6.2. Materials and Methods 

Contrarily to the previous chapter, the raw material used in these studies was virgin 

hardwood pulp. This raw material was used as reference to avoid irregularities coming 

from the variability of recycled pulps lots. Such approach is justified from an academic 

point of view. Therefore, Eucalyptus globulus bleached kraft industrial pulp, E, kindly 

supplied by Renova FPA, S.A. was used as reference raw material for the dyeing studies. 

The dyes and fixative agent tested, also supplied by Renova, were the following: 

? Pergasol
®
 Black GN-E (BASF, direct anionic dye, powder, azo dye) 

? Pergasol
®
 Red 7BE (BASF, direct anionic dye, powder, diazo dye) 

? Pergasol

 Violet BN-TKZ (BASF, direct anionic dye, liquid, diazo dye) 

? Pergasol

? Cartasol Blue 3R-EU (Clariant, direct anionic dye, liquid, azo dye) 

? Synthro

6.2.1. Preliminary tests with Pergasol Red 7BE and Pergasol Black GNE  

? Propylene Glycol (96%, Dowcal) 

? Distilled water 

Preliminary tests performed with Renova dyes (Pergasol Red 7BE and Pergasol 

Black GN-E), aimed to evaluate UHP abilities improving dye impregnation and fixation on 

pulp.  

Since at this point the UHP equipment with higher capacity was not yet available, 

due to the limited capacity of the available one, and thus the insufficient amount of sample 

to produce standard handsheets, smaller handsheets were prepared under an adapted 

procedure. The small handsheets were prepared in laboratory through filtration, with a 

porous glass filter (no.3, Ø=60 mm). Firstly, 2%, 1% and 0.5% (w/v) of dye solutions 

(Pergasol Red 7BE and Pergasol Black GN-E) were prepared, together with a fixative 

(Synthro – Fix) solution of 0.05% (w/v). Pulp was weighted (1 g) and then dispersed in 

100 mL of cationic resin solution. The dispersion was allowed to stir during 5 min for 

interaction with fibres and was then filtered. To the filtered pulp 44 mL of dye solution 

was added. Then, after the homogenization of the pulp dispersion, samples meant for UHP 

treatment were placed on plastic bags, vacuum sealed, and subjected to UHP treatment 

(400 MPa, 15 min), whereas non-treated samples were subjected to stirring for 15 min 

(reference).

 Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes 

The UHP treatment was performed using a High Pressure U33 device (Institute of 

High Pressure Physics, Poland), with a high pressure vessel of approximately 100 cm
3
 

capacity, filled with a pressure transmitting medium (propylene glycol:water, 1:1, v/v). 

After impregnation, the coloured pulp suspensions were diluted up to 100 mL, with 

distilled water, homogenized and separated into equal dispersions of 20 mL. Each solution 

(20 mL x 0.2 g of pulp) was used to prepare small paper sheets by filtration through a glass 

porous filter. The wet paper sheets were collected and left drying on aluminium sheets 

overnight (~70 g/m
2
). When dried, all paper sheets were evaluated on its smooth side with 

a CM-2300d spectrometer from Konica Minolta to access the colour intensity. 

6.2.1.1. Optimization of UHP conditions (pressure and time) 

These tests were carried out to perceive the UHP conditions (pressure and time) most 

advantageous for the pulp dyeing process. The used protocol was similar to that described 

in section 6.2.1, although with small differences. The dye concentration was fixed at 1% 

(w/v). The tested dyes were Pergasol Black GN-E and Pergasol Red 7BE, at different UHP 

conditions 300 MPa (10, 20, 30 min), 400MPa (10, 20, 30 min) and 500 MPa (5, 10, 15 

min). The UHP treatment was performed at the same equipment as described in section 

6.2.1. The procedure for paper sheets preparation was also the same as employed before 

and described in 6.2.1. When dried, handsheets were evaluated on its smooth side with a 

CM-2300d spectrometer from Konica Minolta. 

6.2.2. Determination of the optimum fixative load (OFL)  

Due to the difficulties found for dyes fixation on pulp from relatively concentrated 

dye solutions, a new protocol was used, kindly suggested by Renova, to enable the 

determination of the amount of fixative required for an optimized dye fixation. The 

determination of the optimum fixative load (OFL), was determined considering an 

approximation of Renova norm PT.LAB.613, without UHP treatment, for the following 

dyes: Pergasol Black GN-E, Pergasol Red 7BE, Pergasol Violet BN-TKZ, Pergasol
 
2G-Z 

and Cartasol Blue 3R-EU.  

Pulp suspensions of 16 g/L concentration were prepared by dispersing 0.4 g of pulp 

(dry weight) in 25 mL of distilled water. Each sample was then treated according to 

conditions presented in Table 6. 1. For these trials solutions of 2% (w/v) of dye and 

fixative were used. The required volume was calculated based on Table 6. 1 information.

Following the protocol described in Table 6. 1, each pulp suspension was diluted up 

to 100 mL, homogenised and divided into two equal dispersions of 50 mL each. These 

were further filtered on a glass porous filter (no.3, Ø=60 mm) and left drying on 

aluminium sheets overnight. When dried all paper sheets were evaluated on its smooth side 

with a CM-2300d spectrometer from Konica Minolta. The OFL values determined for each 

dye were compared with typical OFL values determined on Renova quality control, to 

verify any eventual differences in the results obtained. 

6.2.2.1. Effect of UHP on fixative load variations 

After determining the load of fixative required to achieve an optimum dye fixation, 

further tests after UHP treatment of pulp were conducted. These trials were carried out on a 

new 55L capacity equipment (high pressure apparatus, model 55 Hyperbaric). Since larger 

scale assays were possible, this enabled the production of standard handsheets on Renova 

facilities, in agreement with Renova norm PT.Lab.613. 

Using the same dyes as in section 6.2.2. (Pergasol Black GN-E, Pergasol Red 7BE, 

Pergasol Violet BN-TKZ, Pergasol
 
2G-Z, and Cartasol Blue 3R-EU), and also considering 

each dye OFL (determined following section 6.2.2), each sample was prepared individually 

in amounts enough to allow handsheet preparation on Renova’s Rapid-Köthen sheet 

former (Karl Schröder KG). 

In a typical experimental set pulp dispersions of 16 g/L concentration were prepared 

(2 g – 125 mL) with a dye load of 3% (wdye/wpulp). The dye and the fixative were applied 

following the order indicated in Table 6. 1, from 2% (w/v) dye and fixative solutions, 

prepared beforehand.  

One set of samples was subjected to UHP (500 MPa, 10 min, in aqueous medium), 

while the other (reference) was just subjected to stirring. Then, both samples were used to 

prepare (~60 g/m
2
). The effect of UHP on the dye fixation, by removing certain 

percentages of fixative, was also evaluated. These tests aimed to verify the UHP effect on a 

dye fixation, thus allowing the savings of fixative. Three types of samples were prepared, 

while reducing fixative by 5, 10 and 15% in relation to the expected amounts as indicated 



 

~ 190 ~ 

  

 Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes 

in Table 6. 1. Each sample was also subjected to UHP (500 MPa, 10 min) or stirred only 

for comparative reasons (reference sample). The produced samples were used to prepare 

standard handsheets, and then were evaluated using a spectrometer from Konica Minolta, 

model CM-2300d. 

6.2.3. Determination of fixative optimum load (OFL) after UHP treatment 

The effect of UHP on the dye-fixative-substrate equilibrium was also studied (norm 

PT.Lab.613). Five sets of pulp suspensions of 16 g/L concentration (2 g x 125 mL each) 

were prepared and treated according with the steps described on Table 6. 1. Afterwards 

samples were vacuum sealed in HDPE flasks and subjected to UHP (500 MPa, 10 min – 

equipment model 55, Hyperbaric). The resultant samples were then used to produce 

standard handsheets on a Rapid-Köthen sheet former, for colour evaluation. The coloured 

handsheets were analysed on spectrometer from Konica Minolta, model CM-2300d. 

6.2.4. Dye savings study 

Pergasol Red 7BE was selected as a case study to evaluate the 

differences/similarities existing between different colour levels upon UHP treatment. The 

main purpose was to evaluate the ability of UHP to promote the dyeing of pulp fibres, thus 

saving the dye stock. Accordingly, 16 g/L pulp suspensions were prepared and dyed using 

Pergasol Red 7BE, with 3% (w/w) of dye load. Here the fixative and dye loads were those 

as in Table 6. 1 and Table 6. 2. The amount of fixative added was in agreement with the 

OFL UHP pre-determined as described in section 6.2.3. (fixative concentration no. 6 for 

Pergasol Red 7BE). Afterwards, samples were subjected to UHP (500 MPa, 10 min) and 

used to produce handsheets. For comparative reasons, pulp samples dyed with 3 and 4% 

(wdye/wpulp) dye concentration were also prepared. In these cases, the fixative amount 

added was in agreement with the OFL determined without UHP (fixative concentration no. 

4 for Pergasol Red 7BE).

6.2.5. Coloured papers evaluation 

6.2.5.1. Colour and spectral data 

Colour and spectral data, such as L*a*b, ?E and K/S(?max) were obtained by analysis 

of coloured paper sheets. These parameters were also acquired for bleedfastness tests on a 

spectrometer from Konica Minolta, model CM-2300d. Each measurement was the result of 

4 measurements in different sites of each sample. The evaluation of the magnitude of 

colour variation was performed considering Table 2.6 from Chapter 2.  

6.2.5.2. Colour fastness 

? Acetic acid (99%, VWR) 

? Saliva simulant (Renova) 

? Olive oil (Renova) 

? Distilled water 

Colour fastness tests were performed in Renova’s Laboratories, in agreement with a 

Renova’s norm PT.LAB.327, which is based on norms EN646:2006 (“Paper and board 

intended to come into contact with foodstuff – Determination of colour fastness of dyed 

paper and board”) and ISO 105-A03:1993 (“Textiles – Tests for colour fastness – Part A03 

Grey scale for assessing staining”).  

For these tests, test pieces of coloured papers (dimensions 50 mm x 20 mm) were 

prepared and subjected to different media, namely distilled water, acetic acid (3% (w/v)), 

saliva simulant and olive oil. Firstly, two sheets of unstained glass fibre paper (dimension 

60 mmx45 mm) were immersed in a test fluid and removed after saturation. The excess 

fluid was removed. Then, one sheet of the saturated unstained glass fibre paper (smooth 

side upwards) was placed on a glass plate (dimensions 60 mm  x90 mm). Immediately 

after, a test paper piece was placed on the unstained glass fibre paper, and was then 

covered by the second saturated unstained glass fibre paper (smooth side in contact with 

the test piece). Then, this last was further covered by a second glass plate. Finally, a mass 

of 1 Kg was placed on top of the abovementioned assembly, and kept protected from direct 

light penetration for 10 min. Afterwards, the glass fibre papers were removed and when 

dried these last were analysed using a spectrometer (CM-2300d from Konica Minolta). The 

acquired data was analysed in terms of ?E (determined based on the colour coordinated of 

the stained glass papers and an unstained one (reference)). The acquired values were 

analyses for colour fastness in agreement to Table 6. 3.

6.3. Results and Discussion 

As previously depicted the impregnation studies with dyes were performed using 

solely using virgin hardwood fibres as reference raw material to avoid irregularities 

coming from different lots of recycled pulps.  

6.3.1. Preliminary tests  

Preliminary tests with two dyes supplied by Renova were performed as described in 

section 6.2.1. These tests aimed to study differences that could emerge by employing UHP 

treatment on fibres dyeing process. The dyes selected were the two of the most problematic 

for Renova, Pergasol Red 7BE and Pergasol Black GN-E. The conditions applied were 

standard UHP conditions, used in previous assays (400 MPa, 15 min). For each dye, three 

sets of pulp samples (treated in advance with fixative agent) were impregnated with 2, 1 

and 0.5% (wdye/vsolution) dye solutions. Since at this stage the pilot UHP equipment of high 

capacity (55 L) was not yet available, and due to the low capacity (100 mL) of the existing 

one, the produced paper sheets were prepared by filtration of a diluted and homogenous 

dispersion of each sample, yielding handsheets with approximately 70 g/m
2
.  

The colorimetric and spectral data from each sample, namely L*a*b, and K/S(?max) 

(measurement of intensity/concentration), respectively, were collected and are presented in 

Table 6. 4 and 6. 5. For simplicity, in both cases, samples treated with UHP were labelled 

“X% with UHP”, while untreated samples were labelled “X% without UHP”, where X% is 

the concentration of the dye solution used in the dyeing process. 

In Table 6. 4 it possible to observe the results achieved for samples impregnated with 

Pergasol Red 7BE. In this case, samples revealed higher K/S after UHP treatment, than in 

the assay without UHP, which imply an improved dye penetration and fixation on 

cellulosic fibres. From the L*a*b coordinates the differences in colour between untreated 

and UHP treated samples (?E) were determined. All UHP treated samples exhibited clear 

colour differences, being the most significant achieved for samples dyed with the lowest 

dye load (with 0.5% (w/v) dye solution). The set of samples impregnated with 2% (w/v) 

exhibited a ?E between 1 and 2, meaning that the colour difference was small, only 

perceptible to experienced observers (Table 2. 6, Chapter 2).
[11]

 . Additionally, both 

samples sets impregnated with 0.5% (w/v) and 1% (w/v), exhibited a ?E between 2 and 

3.5, which imply a perceivable colour difference between non-treated and UHP treated 

samples.  



 

~ 194 ~ 

  

 Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes 

Both colorimetric and spectral data suggest higher colour intensities in UHP treated 

samples, which imply a higher dye fixation. As demonstrated in previous chapters and in 

the literature,
[8–10]

 UHP treatment promotes forced hydration of fibrils, yielding their 

disaggregation and improved accessibility. In this case, the use of UHP treatment, for dye 

impregnation, has enabled a more efficient penetration of dye molecules, with fixative 

agent molecules, into the fibrillary structure, than without the application of UHP. As 

result an increased amount of dye molecules were retained, yielding higher colour 

intensity.

 *?E determined for each UHP processed sample in comparison to sample dyed without UHP. 

In the case of Pergasol Black GN-E (Table 6. 5) a slightly different behaviour was 

registered. Upon UHP, samples impregnated with 0.5% (w/v) dye solution displayed a 

slightly lower K/S, while, on the other hand, samples impregnated with 1 and 2% (w/v) dye 

solutions displayed higher K/S after the UHP treatment. These differences, relatively to 

Pergasol Red 7BE, suggest that the differences existing between both dye molecules 

structure affect the interaction between dye and cellulose. From the colour coordinates the 

?E values were also determined. The samples treated with the lowest dye concentration 

exhibited a value of 3.42, which is in the range of perceivable colour difference, towards a 

less intense colouration. On the other hand, other samples, treated by UHP, registered 

some improvements in dyeing. In the case of 1 and 2% (w/v) load of the dye a ?E of 1.44 

and 0.85 (only perceivable to experienced observers), were registered, respectively. 

Although, in some cases, UHP treatment revealed enhanced impregnation, as 

expected, the variation found suggests changes on the fixation process related, possibly, 

with the differences existing between the molecular structures of the two dyes.

6.3.1.1. Effect of UHP conditions 

The most advantageous UHP conditions (pressure and time) for the impregnation 

process with dyes were also studied. Dyeing tests were performed as described before 

(section 6.3.1.), with Pergasol Red 7BE and Pergasol Black GN-E, for fixed dye load 

(pulps were impregnated with a 1% (w/v) dye solution) at different time (10-30 min) and 

pressure conditions (300-500 MPa). 

The colorimetric and spectral data acquired from each sample are presented in Table 

6. 6 for samples dyed with Pergasol Red 7BE, and in Table 6. 7 for samples dyed with 

Pergasol Black GN-E. As concerns Pergasol Red 7BE, (Table 6. 6) it is possible to observe 

that an increase in pressure and time of UHP treatment led to an increase of K/S in treated 

pulps. Although, considering the acquired data, the conditions conveying higher K/S were 

300 MPa/20 min, followed by 400 MPa/30 min and 500 MPa/10 min. 

Similarly, to Pergasol Red 7BE, the results for Pergasol Black GN-E (Table 6. 7) 

also demonstrated that longer pressurization times and higher pressure conditions applied, 

resulted in higher K/S values. The best results, in terms of K/S, were achieved for 500 MPa 

and 10 min of pressurization. 

However, considering time as a relevant factor in pulp processing, and the data 

obtained from the studies of both dyes, 500 MPa and 10 min were selected as the optimum 

conditions, due to the highest K/S values achieved with both dyes (measurement of colour 

density on fibres). The values of (K/S) are also frequently used at Renova Laboratories as 

criteria for the selection of optimum conditions.

*?E determined for each UHP processed sample in comparison to sample dyed without UHP. 

The improved results on dyeing at long pressurization times and high pressures are in 

agreement with the severity of the UHP treatment applied. These UHP conditions provide 

the highest accessibility of fibres, favouring the best conditions for the adsorption of dyes. 

Nevertheless, results of section 6.3.1., revealed some discrepancy in results. At 

constant fixative load, by varying the dye concentration, the colour intensity of handsheets 

should increase with the increase of dye concentration in solution. However, it was not 

always the case. In these preliminary studies, in order to reveal the UHP effects, a minimal 

amount of fixative agent was used. However, it seems that the fixative agent plays a rather 

relevant role as intermediate of the dye fixation process and requires specific adjustments 

for each dye.

 Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes 

Despite during UHP treatment the accessibility of fibres increase and its zeta 

potential decreases, the still high negative charge of fibres requires some additional 

amounts of fixative agent to improve dyes adsorption. This is confirmed by zeta potential 

measurements of pulp and of a dye solution (Pergasol Black GN-E) (Table 6. 8). 

Bearing in mind the aforementioned result, the determination of the fixative optimum 

load (OFL), was required. 

Table 6. 8 – Zeta potential measurements of a Pergasol Black GN-E solution and of pulp treated with and without UHP 

(EHP and E, respectively).

6.3.2. Optimization of fixative loads 

6.3.2.1. Optimum fixative load (OFL) without UHP treatment 

The importance of fixative agent concentrations on the dyeing process of bleached 

kraft hardwood pulp was studied. Hence assays were performed to determine the load of 

fixative agent required to ensure optimum dyeing, under conventional impregnation 

(without UHP treatment). In these studies, Renova norm PT.LAB.613 was followed, as 

depicted in section 6.2.2. Besides, the determination of the optimum fixative load (OFL) 

was performed with other dyes. The other dyes include Cartasol Blue 3R-EU, Pergasol 

Violet BN-TKZ and Pergasol Red 2G-Z. The aim of this study was to relate the fibre 

dyeing with the molecular structure of dye molecules and different dyes furnishes (powder 

or liquid). 

In those tests six different loads of fixative agent were tested, as displayed in Table 6. 

9. In each loading the fixative must be applied in two stages, one at the beginning, before 

adding the dye, and then, the other at the end, after the addition and dispersion of the dye. 

The initial step of fixative agent addition is related with the necessity of increasing zeta 

potential of cellulosic fibres, to assist their interaction with dyes due to the existing 

electrostatic repulsion between them. Then, dye molecules are added and should interact 

more easily with cellulosic fibres due to the presence of a cationic intermediate (fixative 

agent). The final addition of fixative acts as a way to precipitate the remaining dye on 

fibres surface. This may occur by the formation of insoluble dye-fixative particles that 

precipitates on the fibres surface.

 Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes 

As concerns the determination of the optimum fixative loads, the procedure was 

performed at fixed dye load (3% (wdye/wpulp)), with different fixative loads (Table 6. 9). 

Table 6. 9 – Different fixative loads for 3% (wdye/wpulp) of dye concentration.

To perceive which load of fixing agent would be more advantageous, according to 

Renova norms (Renova PT.LAB 613), K/S was used as criteria. The results upon each dye 

OFL are given by Table 6. 10.

The values of K/S of dyed paper sheets, with each dye, suggest an increasing of dye 

fixation with fixative agent content that reaches a maximum followed by a decrease. These 

features reflect possibly the necessity of fixative molecules to act as an intermediate for the 

dye fixation process. After reaching the maximum (K/S), the existence of excess of fixative 

load in solution may possibly contribute for its dispersion in solution. By recharging of the

double layer in fibres and micelles of dyes, less amount of dye interacts and is retained by 

fibres. Apparently this favoured the decrease of K/S values in hand sheets. 

Considering the K/S values in Table 6. 10, it was possible to conclude that the OFL 

(considering the fixative additions in Table 6. 9) for Pergasol Red 7BE was no. 4, for 

Pergasol Black GN-E was no. 3, for Pergasol Violet BN-TKZ was no. 2, for Cartasol Blue 

3R-EU was no. 4 and for Pergasol Red 2G-Z was no. 2. 

6.3.2.2. UHP effect on the impregnation of pulps with different dyes 

After determining the OFL of each dye, a set of new tests was performed, but now 

resorting to UHP treatment. The UHP conditions were selected considering the results 

obtained in section 6.3.1.1 and were as follows: 500 MPa pressure and 10 min. 

Additionally, the decrease of fixative agent load by 5, 10 and 15% of fixing agent load, 

upon UHP, was also tested. These changes on fixative loads aimed to evaluate when UHP 

would convey similar or better results, while allowing fixative savings. 

 It is noteworthy that, at this point, a new UHP equipment, with higher capacity (55 

L), was available, which allowed the preparation of all samples in sufficient amount to 

produce standard handsheets. All samples were evaluated considering its K/S (?max) value 

and colour space data. These studies were further completed with colour fastness tests, 

following the procedure presented in section 6.2.5.2. These tests were performed to 

evaluate the colour fastness of each sample, since in case of coloured tissue paper it is 

required insignificant or zero dye bleeding. For simplicity samples were designated as 

follows: 

3% without UHP – pulp dyed with a dye load of 3% (wdye/wpulp), not subjected to UHP; 

3% with UHP – pulp dyed with a dye load of 3 %(wdye/wpulp), subjected to UHP; 

3% with UHP | -5% fixatives – pulp dyed with a dye load of 3% (wdye/wpulp), subjected to 

UHP, whose OFL was reduced by 5%; 

3% with UHP | -10% fixatives – pulp dyed with a dye load of 3% (wdye/wpulp), subjected 

to UHP, whose OFL was reduced by 10%; 

3% with UHP | -15% fixatives – pulp dyed with a dye load of 3% (wdye/wpulp), subjected 

to UHP, whose OFL was reduced by 15%. 

i) Pergasol Red 7BE 

The data for samples dyed with Pergasol Red 7BE is presented in Table 6. 11. The 

achieved results allow to confirm the ability of UHP to enhance dye fixation on fibres. By 

comparing samples impregnated in 3% (w/w) dye load, with and without UHP, it was 



 

~ 200 ~ 

  

 Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes 

possible to observe a much higher K/S in the case of UHP treated sample. Also, the high 

?E (7.05) indicated a substantial colour gain by fibres. These results evidenced the abilities 

of UHP to improve the fibres accessibility and the capacity of dyeing. Moreover, even with 

removal of 5, 10 and even 15% fixative, it was still possible to maintain the relatively 

higher dye fixation on fibres, as confirmed by the high K/S values and the colour 

differences expressed by ?E.  

Each sample bleedfastness was also analysed considering four diffusion media 

(water, acetic acid, synthetic saliva and olive oil). The results are represented in Table D.1 

in the Appendices, and did not exhibited variations. This points no effects on the dye 

fixation on fibres caused by UHP treatment and the amount of fixative used.

ii) Pergasol Black GN-E 

As concerns Pergasol Black GN-E (Table 6. 12), here the results diverged from those 

achieved with Pergasol Red 7BE. After UHP treatment the K/S of samples decreased in 

relation to non-treated samples, yielding a significant colour difference (lighter shade). 

Moreover, when removing fixative, the results either maintained or decreased even more. 

These features indicate that the fixative load, determined without UHP, is not enough to 

sustain the dye impregnation/fixation with UHP. Possibly, due to the dye molecules nature, 

a preferential impregnation with fixative is occurring. Thus, remaining fixatives molecules 

may not be enough to intermediate the process of approximation between cellulose and 

anionic dye. In this case UHP may have caused disturbances on the equilibrium between 

dye-fixative-cellulose and hence changing the required amount of fixative, for dye fixation, 

with UHP. It is noteworthy that dye molecules structures are not known. Additionally, it is 

also unknown whether dyes are made solely by one type of molecule of by a mixture of 

dye molecules.

suggest that the dye fixation on fibres was not affected by UHP treatment and the amount 

of fixative used. 

iii) Cartasol Blue 3R-EU 

Cartasol Blue, similarly to the above dyes, is also a direct anionic dye, although 

supplied in the liquid form. The results on pulp dyeing with this dye are presented in Table 

6. 13.

*?E determined for each UHP processed sample in comparison to sample dyed without UHP. 

The results obtained with Cartasol Blue 3R-EU revealed, similarly to Pergasol Red 

7BE, an improvement of dye adsorption on fibres, upon UHP treatment. This fact was 

confirmed by the increased K/S and the ?E of 0.88. Also, upon diminishing of fixative, K/S 

did vary significantly, being even registered higher values of K/S, with 15% decrease of 

fixative agent, than with full charge. In terms of colour difference, the ?E was of 2.19, 

which is in the range of perceivable colour difference by unexperienced observers. These 

results corroborate the aforementioned hypothesis that UHP should affect the existing 

equilibrium between dye, fixative and cellulose, which imply a shift on the OFL. Colour 



 

~ 202 ~ 

  

 Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes 

fastness results (Table D.3 on the Appendices) also demonstrated no significant variations 

between assays. Therefore, it is possible to suggest that dye fixation on fibres was not 

affected by UHP treatment and by the amount of fixative used. 

iv) Pergasol Red 2G-Z 

The results acquired with Pergasol Red 2G-Z samples are depicted in Table 6. 14. In 

opposite to previous results, K/S decreased from 2.14 to 1.83, after impregnation with UHP 

treatment, with a perceivable colour difference, when considering ?E (lighter shade). 

Moreover, the decrease in K/S became even more significant upon fixative removal. It is 

possible that the balance existing between the three intervening parts (dye, fixative and 

cellulose) may be shifted due to UHP treatment. Thus, it is possible, once more, that the 

different fixative load is required. It is also important to recall that low amounts of fixative 

decrease the dye fixation, and the excess of fixative could originate dye dispersion in 

solution, and hence evading its fixation onto fibres.

Similarly to before, bleedfastness was also accessed for all samples and its results are

fibres bleedfastness were registered. 

v) Pergasol Violet BN-TKZ 

Finally, pulp dyeing was performed by applying Pergasol Violet BN-TKZ (Table 6. 

15). Samples impregnated with 3% (w/w) dye, upon UHP treatment revealed a decrease of 

K/S, which according to colour space coordinates registered a minimal colour difference, 

?E. Although the reducing of 5% fixative load, upon UHP treatment, yielded an increase 

of K/S, the diminishing of K/S was observed when the fixative reduction was 10 or 15%. 

These K/S values were accompanied by ?E.

6.3.2.3. Optimum fixative load (OFL) after UHP treatment 

Due to the divergence in previously obtained results, it was necessary to determine 

the optimum fixative load (OFL) after the UHP treatment, similarly as it was done for the 

dyeing without UHP treatment (section 6.3.2.1.). The UHP conditions were as follows: 

pressure - 500MPa, duration – 10min. 

i) Pergasol Red 7BE 

Although previous results demonstrated the improvements of this dye adsorption in 

fibres (Table 6. 11), OFL was determined again, now after UHP treatment. The results 

obtained are summarised in Table 6.16 and 6.17. In Table 6. 16 it is possible to observe the 

K/S and colour space data for each fixative load (no. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, as indicated in 

Table 6. 9). Here the highest K/S was used as criteria in the process of selection of the 

OFL, which was 6.

 Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes 

Relatively to the OFL without UHP treatment (load 4 in Table 6. 17), this shift 

towards a higher load of fixative agent (load no.6 in Table 6. 17), suggests an increased 

demand on fixative, possibly due to a preferential insertion of the cationic resin (fixative) 

in fibres. Together with improved dye diffusion into fibres, due to UHP treatment, this last 

factor could have contributed for the efficient fixation of dye molecules on fibres. Such 

enhanced dyeing efficiency, with increased OFL, was evidenced both by K/S and ?E 

values. It is worth to note that an enhanced dyeing efficiency may lead to the diminishing 

of organic charge in the mill effluent and hence creating fewer problems in residual waters 

treatment. It is also reasonable to propose that these improvements could lead to deep 

colour shades without resorting to higher dye loading. This was a topic of further studies.

The bleedfastness (Table D.1, Appendices) was also accessed and the results 

revealed no significant variations among samples (bleedfastness degrees between 4 and 5) 

of dyed hand sheets, produced from UHP treated and untreated pulps. Small variations 

were only found between 4 and 5 bleedfastness degree on samples from OFL after UHP 

treatment, possibly due to the variation of fixative amount. 

ii) Pergasol Black GN-E 

Considering the variations found on previous results, Pergasol Black GN-E was also 

tested for a OFL with UHP. The results attained are presented in Table 6. 18. There, it is 

possible to observe the colour space and spectral data for each fixative load (no. 1, 2, 3, 4, 

5 and 6, as depicted in Table 6. 1) upon UHP (500 MPa, 15 min). K/S was used as the 

criteria, being selected, as the OFL with UHP the sample with the highest K/S value. The 

OFL with UHP, according to the acquired data, was no. 5, which implies a shift towards 

higher fixative loadings, when compared with the OFL without UHP (load no. 3). 

However, a higher coloration of pulp was attained with the OFL after UHP, relatively to 

OFL without UHP treatment. 

By comparing both OFLs, determined with and without UHP (Table 6. 19), similarly 

to Pergasol Red 7BE case, the observed change towards higher fixative loadings suggests

 Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes 

shifts on equilibrium between dye-fixative and cellulose, which could be related with an 

increased adsorption of fixative on fibres. Apparently, this increased load was not enough 

to cause the dye dispersion in solution, but induced a higher improved dye fixation on 

fibres. Hence, OFL after UHP treatment exhibited an increased K/S, with a ?E superior to 

5, i.e. a clearly distinguished colour gain.

The bleedfastness (Table D.2, Appendices) alike before, was analysed and its results 

revealed no significant changes in terms of bleedfastness degrees (between 4 and 5). The 

most significant variations (which were still small) were found on the samples for the 

determination of OFL with UHP, possibly due to fixative variation. 

iii) Cartasol Blue 3R-EU 

Cartasol Blue 3R-EU was also examined for OFL after UHP treatment. The results 

obtained with different fixative loads are displayed in Table 6. 20. In contrast to the two 

previous dyes (Pergasol Black GN-E and Pergasol Red 7BE), it was found a shift towards 

lower fixative loading (from no.4 to 2) of OFL after UHP, relatively to OFL without UHP 

treatment. Besides, samples impregnated after UHP still exhibited higher K/S than without 

UHP treatments (Table 6. 21). 

The OFL after UHP treatment was determined based on the fixative load rendering 

the highest K/S, which was load no. 2. The decrease found on the required load of fixative,

 Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes 

to achieve the optimum dye fixation could be related, not directly to a preferential 

adsorption of fixative on fibres, but with a decreased repulsion between this dye molecules 

and cellulose. It is known that different dye molecules, although anionic, may interact 

differently (more or less strongly attracted to cellulose) due to its structural peculiarities. 

The planar geometry of most direct anionic dyes, favours significantly the interactions with 

cellulose. Nevertheless, although the dye molecule charge (located in some part of the 

molecule) convey some repulsion towards cellulose, other functional groups or even its 

carbon backbone, may interact with cellulose through other mechanisms. Thus it is 

possible that Cartasol Blue 3R-EU, upon UHP, was adsorbed more efficiently on fibres, 

possibly, due to its improved affinity towards cellulose (decreased repulsion in relation to 

other dyes). Hence, less amount of fixatives was required for the mediation of the dye 

fixation. However, since the molecular structure of this dye is unknown this hypothesis 

was not confirmed.

iv) Pergasol Violet BN-TKZ  

Pergasol Violet BN-TKZ was the next examined liquid dye. The results obtained are 

depicted in Tables 6.22 and 6.23. As regards the determination of OFL after UHP 

treatment, the result was the same as without UHP (load no. 2).

treated with UHP treatment displayed higher K/S values. Also, the colour difference, ?E, 

of both samples was higher than 1, in the range of minimal difference perceivable by 

experienced observers.

The bleedfastness tests of coloured pulps subjected and non-subjected to UHP 

revealed non-significant variations (Table D.4, Appendices). 

The results obtained with Pergasol Violet BN-TKZ suggest that the preferential 

adsorption of fixatives (due to its high affinity towards cellulose) may not occur. Possibly, 

both dye and fixative, are adsorbed on fibres equally and hence no shift on the OFL was 

observed, with and without UHP treatment of pulp. The only difference was apparently the 



 

~ 208 ~ 

  

 Chapter VI | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Dyes 

enhanced ability of both compounds to diffuse into the fibres, induced by UHP treatment. 

Hence, UHP, although in a small and not very significant way, promoted an increase on the 

dye fixation on fibres, without compromising the equilibrium between dye-fixative-

cellulose.  

v) Pergasol Red 2G-Z 

To conclude, Pergasol Red 2G-Z coloured samples were analysed at different levels 

of fixative loads (Table 6. 24). Similarly to Pergasol Violet BN-TKZ, Pergasol Reg 2G-Z 

also exhibited the same OFL with and without UHP, as depicted in Table 6. 24, 

considering the highest K/S value.

In contrast to Pergasol Violet BN-TKZ, Pergasol Red 2G-Z displayed a higher K/S of 

OFL without UHP samples than that after UHP treatment. Also the colour difference, ?E, 

was superior to 2, i.e. in the range of perceivable colour difference (lighter shade). 

Therefore, UHP have affected the dyeing process negatively. 

As discussed before, each dye features interfere with the dyeing process (its 

structure, affinity and substantivity). It is thus possible that this dye may be rather sensible 

to fixative concentration in solution and, therefore, shifts on fixative concentration in 

solution, upon UHP, may promote the dye dispersion in solution, instead of dye diffusion 

and fixation on the fibre surface.

For Pergasol Red 2G-Z, bleedfatsness tests were also performed, and similarly to the 

previous dyes no significant variations were observed (Table D.5, Appendices). 

6.3.2.4. Saving of dyes 

Pergasol Red 7BE was selected as a case study to evaluate if UHP could provide dye 

savings. Hence, tests were performed with Pergasol Red 7BE, resorting to OFL with and 

without UHP treatment, at 3% (wdye/wpulp) and 4% (wdye/wpulp) dye concentrations. These 

tests aimed to evaluate the fixation ability of UHP towards the dye and the potential dye 

savings (which are rather expensive). The results obtained in terms of K/S, and colour 

space data are shown in Table 6. 26. It was found that the colour intensity of 4% (w/w) of 

dye concentration, without UHP was similar to that obtained with 3% (wdye/wpulp) of dye 

concentration after UHP treatment. These results revealed that UHP enabled an 

improved/enhanced dye fixation, able to match or approach the colour intensity of a 

sample produced with a superior dye load. Even though the shift on fixative agent load 

from no. 4 (2.5% (w/w) fixative) to no. 6 (3.5% (w/w), due to UHP effect (ca. 40% extra 

fixative agent), the results achieved showed ca. 33% of dye savings, which is much more 

expensive than a fixative agent. 

These result evidenced a possibility of dyes savings while subjecting pulp to UHP 

treatment.

6.4. Conclusions 

The achieved results allowed to conclude that, overall, UHP enabled an improved 

fixation of dyes on fibres. The positive effect of UHP must be related to the improved 

accessibility of cellulose in pulp and decreasing of its electrokinetic potential (zeta 

potential). At the same time, it was verified that different dyes, displayed different sorption 

behaviours, which were further enhanced upon UHP treatment. It was suggested that these 

differences could be related to i) chemical structure of dye molecules, ii) dyes affinity and 

substantivity, iii) variations of cationic fixative concentration, and iv) the influence of UHP 

on the dye-fixative-cellulose equilibrium. However, it was not possible to prove or confirm 

the phenomena involved due to the lacking of information on each dye structures. Anyway, 

the optimum fixative loads were specific for each dye studied and apparently related to the 

balance between it sorption on the fibres and the interaction with dyes, thus forming 

charged micelles dispersed in the stock. 

It was also confirmed that UHP treatment of pulp allows dyes savings at the same 

level of colour intensity acquired by fibres.

 Chapter VII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Humectants 

7.1. Introduction 

Tissue paper is a common good extensively used by modern societies. Tissue 

products include items such as paper towels, facial tissues or toilet paper, easily found in 

any small or big groceries store. Due to its end purposes, it is easy to recognized two main 

physical attributes of these products, softness and their absorbency, with especial emphasis 

on absorbency. The particular challenge in papermaking has been to appropriately balance 

these various properties to provide superior tissue paper. 
[1–4]

 

Tissue papers and towelling grades that require good absorbency also require suitable 

strength properties to maintain their structural integrity. Although often becomes difficult 

to balance both, since both requirements tend to conflict.
[5]

 Although somewhat desirable 

for towel products, softness is particularly important property for facial and toilet tissues. 

[3]
 

Softness is the tactile sensation perceived by the consumer who holds a particular 

paper product, rubs it across the skin, and crumbles it within the hand. Such tactile 

perceivable softness can be characterized by, but is not limited to, friction flexibility and 

smoothness, as well as subjective descriptor, such as feeling like velvet, silk or flannel. 

This tactile sensation is a combination of several physical properties, including the 

flexibility or stiffness of the sheet of paper, the frictional properties of the web, as well as 

the texture of the surface of the paper.
[1,3,4,6]

 

Absorbency is the measure of the ability of a certain material to absorb liquids. 

Overall absorbency as perceived by consumers is generally considered to be a combination 

of the total quantity of liquid a given mass of tissue will absorb at saturation as well as the 

rate at which the mass absorbs the liquid. Absorption can be directly related to the softness 

and bulk, although not always in the same way. Due to paper's affinity for water, paper is 

an absorbent product, the fibres form hydrogen bonds with water. But paper with many 

links between fibres has more resistance to water absorption. This is because there are 

more links between fibres, which makes it less porous, preventing the diffusion of water 

inside. Besides, water penetration must break some links between fibres, delaying the 

penetration itself. 
[1,3,7]

 

The creping in tissue paper is a key operation to improve absorption. During the 

drying operation the sheet adheres to a large dryer called Yankee. When the paper reaches 

the end of the course, once it has been dried, strikes against a blade which causes the paper 

to crinkle, developing microwrinkles. In this operation many bonds between fibres that had 

been formed during the drying stage, are broken generating a lot of fines, which are 



 

~ 218 ~ 

 

 Chapter VII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Humectants 

capable of absorbing water. It also increases expressively the surface area of the sheet, 

facilitating the interaction with water. Finally, the creping increases the bulk and makes the 

paper soft. Therefore, the creping operation is an essential procedure for tissue paper 

production.
[4,6,8–10]

 

In hygiene and cosmetic products, chemical additives, otherwise denominated as 

wetting agents, humectants or moisturizers may be added to further improve both 

absorptive properties along with softness properties. 
[11]

 In products such as tissue paper or 

non-woven fabrics its composition includes at least one kind of materials selected from 

salts having high hygroscopy, or polymer having high hygroscopy. Such chemical 

materials are preferably chosen from food additives (e.g. polyphosphates), or cosmetic 

ingredients (e.g. glycerine, pyrrodilone, polyethylene glycol, etc.).
[11–14]

 These chemicals 

act by attracting and holding on to water. Thus these compounds are applied, in a wide 

variety of products, either to retard water loss or to increase its uptake. A good example 

would be their use to improve moisture content on tissue paper, by capturing and retaining 

moisture in air, and enhance softness and its feel to skin. 
[11]

 

Ultra-high pressure (UHP) is a technology that has demonstrated its benefits towards 

reversing hornification (responsible for fibres stiffening and losses on hydration), due to 

the structural changes it produces. Besides the rearrangements of crystalline regions, it 

induces forced hydration on amorphous regions provoking water molecules to be 

imprisonment in less accessible sites as strongly bound water. This also provokes fibril 

disaggregation and improved accessibility.
[15]

 This enables higher accessibility towards 

chemicals and enzymes, as demonstrated in the literature.
[15–17]

 With this in mind, the work 

aimed to use UHP to promote the impregnation of humectants on fibres to improve its 

hydrophilic features and thus enhance fibres absorbency. It is also expected that by 

improving moisture capture, the addition of this additives may confer a certain freshness 

and softness to the touch of pulp, although this features will not be considered on this

7.2. Materials and Methods 

Similarly to previous studies on the impregnation of additives, for the reasons 

already described, the raw material used in these studies was virgin hardwood pulp. 

Therefore, Eucalyptus globulus bleached kraft industrial pulp, E, kindly supplied by 

Renova FPA, S.A. was used as reference raw material for the impregnation studies. Also 

the humectants employed were the following: 

? Polyethylene glycol, Mw 200, PEG 200, (99.5%, Acros Organics) 

? Polyethylene glycol Mw 400, PEG 400 (99%, Acros Organics) 

? Polyethylene glycol Mw 600, PEG 600 (99.5%, Acros Organics) 

? Sodium polyphosphate, PP (pure, Acros Organics) 

 

7.2.1. Impregnation of pulp with saturated humectant solutions 

The impregnation of PEG 200 on E pulp was performed as follows: 10 g of pulp 

were dispersed in water and then PEG 200 was added reaching a total volume of 440 mL 

containing 20% (w/v) PEG concentration. These doped pulp samples were prepared by two 

different ways. One was by subjecting samples to UHP treatment (500 MPa for 10 min, 

optimum conditions, previously used on dyes impregnation tests), while the other was by 

subjecting samples to stirring, only, for the same time.  

Samples treated by UHP treatment were placed, beforehand, on HDPE flasks, 

vacuum sealed, and then subjected to UHP. The UHP treatments were performed on a high 

pressure apparatus, model 55 Hyperbaric, with water as pressure transmission medium. 

Samples treated and untreated by UHP were then filtered with glass porous filters 

(previously weighted), allowed to dry and then placed in a desiccator over P2O5 to achieve 

nearly zero moisture content. Afterwards samples were weighted and the shifts on samples 

weights were analysed. The same procedure was used for the impregnation of pulp with 

PEG 400 and PEG 600. Being the only difference the PEG 600 concentration, which was 

10% (w/v). It is noteworthy that the use of a PEG 600 solution with 10% (w/v) of 

concentration, instead of a solution with a concentration of 20% (w/v) (for comparative 

reasons), was due to difficulties on the solubilisation of PEG 600 in water and its relatively 

high viscosity. 

Additionally, the same procedure was applied on the impregnation of pulp with PP, 

being the only difference the impregnation solution concentration, which was 5% (w/v).

7.2.2. Impregnation of pulp with selected humectants 

The same impregnation procedure was carried out, as in section 7.2.1., for the 

following sets of pulp samples, impregnated with 5% (w/v) PEG400, 1% (w/v) PEG400, 

5% (w/v) PP, 1% (w/v) PP and mixture of 0.5% (w/v) PEG with 0.5% (w/v) PP. 

7.2.3. Leaching tests 

The leaching of additives from impregnated pulp samples was accessed according 

to the procedure described below. 1 g of each sample prepared as described in section 

7.2.1, was weighted (in duplicate) and placed in 100mL of distilled water under stirring at 

room temperature. Aliquots were collected from time to time and analysed for released 

additives. PEG samples were analysed by high performance liquid chromatography, 

HPLC, and PP samples by orthophosphate content in solution.  

7.2.3.1. Quantification by High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) 

? Acetonitrile (Acros Organics, 99.9% HPLC grade) 

? Ultrapure water 

The quantification of PEG polymers was performed on an Acella apparatus from 

Thermo Scientific, equipped with an autosampler, a reflective index detector (RI) and a 

diode array detector (PDA). All analyses were carried out with a HypersilGold column, 

from Thermo Scientific, with dimensions 50x2.1mm, particle size of 1.9 ?m and pore size 

of 175 Å. 

In case of PEG 200, analyses were performed using isocratic conditions (4% 

acetonitrile: 96% water), with a 350 ?L/min flow rate, and an injection volume of 10 mL. 

Data was analysed considering PDA results at 190 nm. Calibration was performed 

considering solution of 0.1, 0.4, 0.8 and 1% (w/v), and is represented in Appendices E. 

As concerns PEG 400 and PEG 600, its quantification was performed also under 

isocratic condition (20% acetonitrile, 80% water), with a flowrate of 300 ?L/min, and an 

injection volume of 10 mL. Data was analysed considering PDA results at 194 nm. The 

calibration curves for PEG 400 and PEG 600 quantification was performed considering 

standard solutions of 0.25, 0.5, 0.6, 0.75, 1.2 %(w/v) and 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1% (w/v), 

respectively. These calibration curves are also presented in Appendices E. 

7.2.3.2. Colorimetric quantification of orthophosphates 

? H2SO4 (Acros Organics, 96%) 

? Antimony potassium tartrate (99%, Acros Organics) 



 

~ 221 ~ 

  

 Chapter VII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Humectants 

? Ammonium molybdate (99.9%, Acros Organics) 

? Ascorbic acid (99%, Acros Organics, ) 

? Ammonium Persulphate (99%, Alpha aesar) 

? KH2PO4 (99%, WRV) 

? NaOH (85%, VWR) 

The amount of released PP was followed considering the amount of total 

orthophosphates in solution, in agreement with norm EPA 3652. The process is based on 

ammonium molybdate and antimony potassium tartrate reaction in acid medium with 

dilute solution of phosphorous to form antimony-phospho-molybdate complexes. These 

complexes are reduced to intensely blue coloured complexes by ascorbic acid, being the 

colour proportional to the phosphorus concentration. 

Before quantification, according to the norm, a combined reagent required for the 

tests was prepared. This reactant enables the quantification of orthophosphates. With this 

purpose the following solutions were prepared, H2SO4 5 N, antimony potassium tartrate 

solution (1.3715 g K(SbO)C4H4O·1/2H2O in 500 mL), ammonium molybdate solution (20 

g of (NH4)6 Mo7O24·4H2O in 500 mL distilled water) and ascorbic acid 1 M. For the 

combined reagent preparation, 50 mL of H2SO4 5 N were placed on a beaker under 

constant stirring. Then, by order, the following solutions were added, 5 mL of antimony 

potassium tartrate solution, 15mL of ammonium molybdate solution and 30 mL of ascorbic 

acid solution. The combined reagent was then stored to use on the next steps. 

The quantification of the total of orthophosphates from each sample was 

determined in agreement with procedure described below. Initially, 50 mL of sample (1 

mL aliquots were diluted up to 50 mL) was placed on 100-150 mL beakers, along with 1 

mL of H2SO4 5.5 M and 0.4 g of ammonium persulphate. The mixture was allowed to boil 

until volume was reduced to approximately 10 mL. After cooling down, samples were 

diluted up to 25-30 mL and its pH was tuned to 7.0 ? 0.2 with NaOH solutions (10, 1, 0.1, 

0.01 and 0.001 M) using a pH Meter, model HI2020 - edge® multiparameter, from Hanna 

Instruments. Then, samples were transferred into a 50 mL volumetric flask, to which 8 mL 

of combined reagent were also added. The flasks were then filled with distilled water up to 

50 mL. After 10 min waiting, samples absorbance was measured on UV-vis 

spectrophotometer Evolution 220 (Thermo Scientific) at 880 nm. 

For the preparation of the blank sample, used as reference, the procedure was the 

same, being the only difference the substitution of sample for distilled water.

 Calibration was performed by analysing standard solutions of KH2PO4 between 0.3 

mg/L and 1 mg/L. The calibration curve is represented in Appendice E. 

7.2.4. Moisture uptake 

All samples were investigated for its ability to uptake moisture at room conditions. 

For that 1g of each sample (absolutely dry) was placed on previously weighted petri plates 

(in duplicate). These were then left at room temperature and at ca. 50% relative humidity 

(RH), until constant weight. The moisture uptake of each samples was then determined 

based on equation 6.1.

7.2.5. Handsheet formation 

Handsheets from samples impregnated with the selected humectants, were prepared 

following ISO 5269-2:2004, in a Rapid-Köthen sheet former (Karl Schröder KG). 

7.2.6. Physical and Mechanical Properties 

Fibres drainability was examined according to ISO 5267-1:1999. The paper 

handsheets thickness, density and specific volume was evaluated according with ISO 

534:2011. Furthermore, tensile strength, stretch%, tear index, burst index, air resistance 

(Gurley method), capillary rise and water absorption capacity were evaluated in every 

sample according to, ISO 1924-2:2008, ISO 1974:2012, ISO 2758:2014, ISO 5636-5:2003, 

ISO 8787:1986 and ISO 12625-8:2010, respectively.

7.3. Results and Discussion 

The main purposes on this chapter was to test different humectants that would 

convey cellulose its hygroscopic abilities, to enhance pulp hydrophilicity and thus improve 

pulp sorption abilities. It may be proposed that while gaining an improved ability to 

capture moisture, the softness of pulp would be also improved. 

7.3.1. Tests on different humectants 

Preliminary impregnation tests were performed with different humectants to access 

pulp properties influenced by the presence of these reactants, and to check the UHP 

treatment effect on these properties. Thus, the following additives were tested: sodium 

polyphosphate (PP) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) with different molecular weights, Mw 

200(PEG 200), Mw 400 (PEG 400) and Mw 600 (PEG 600). The same bleached E. globulus 

pulp (E) as used in previous chapters, was employed on these studies. Pulp E was 

impregnated with 20% (w/v) solutions (PEG 200 or 400), 10% (w/v) of PEG 600, or 5% 

(w/v) of PP. A part of this samples were subjected to UHP treatment, while the other was 

subjected to stirring only. For simplicity, samples were designated as shown in Table 7. 1. 

Table 7. 1 – Designations of pulp samples impregnated by PEG and sodium polyphosphate.

7.3.1.1. Additives retention on fibres 

The fixation of additives onto fibres was investigated by monitoring changes of 

samples weights (before and after impregnation, of dried samples) and also by analyses of 

filtrates. The results obtained are presented in Table 7. 2 for samples impregnated with 

PEGs and in Table 7. 3 for samples impregnated with PP. 

Based on weight increment of samples impregnated with saturated PEG solutions, 

before and after the UHP treatment, it was possible to infer that UHP prompted an 

enhanced impregnation of additives to fibres, rendering their increased retention on fibres 



 

~ 224 ~ 

 

 Chapter VII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Humectants 

(Table 7. 2). As discussed in previous chapters, UHP enables an improvement of fibres 

accessibility towards chemicals. Hence, similar behaviour was detected in the study with 

some PEGs solutions. The monitoring of filtrates was also performed for control. 

However, these results are not portrayed here, due to divergences found in results, most 

likely related with high relative errors obtained in dilutions required to enable filtrates 

analysis.

Analysing the experimental data, overall, it was possible to observe, that PEG 400 

solution allowed the best retention/fixation, especially upon UHP treatment. The uptakes 

of PEG 200 and PEG 600 were inferior to that of PEG 400, although the concentration of 

PEG 600 (10% (w/v)) used was inferior to those for PEG 200 and PEG 400 (20% (w/v)). 

However, it seems clear that PEG sorption on fibres depended on their molecular weights. 

This must be related to the PEG capacity to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds and Van-

der-Waals bonds with cellulose and with its diffusion inside fibres. UHP enabled an 

improved diffusion of PEG molecules due to the improved accessibility of fibres, thus 

enhancing the additives adsorption. Besides the specific interaction of PEG with cellulosic 

fibres the diffusion inside fibre cell structure also can be the limiting factor. Hence the best 

results obtained with PEG 400 may be the result of successful combination of both factor. 

Samples impregnated with PP were also monitored, and the obtained results are 

presented in Table 7. 3. In this case the opposite results, relatively to PEG samples, were 

achieved. Instead of an enhanced sorption of PP, upon UHP treatment, a decrease of 

adsorbed PP was registered. However, PP sample exhibited higher rigidity when compared 

to PP HP. Possible explanations may be related to the fact that i) UHP assisted 

impregnation allowed a more uniform distribution of PP and therefore the relatively small 

crystals only are precipitated on fibres, more homogenously distributed and possibly 

strongly hydrated, ii) PP without UHP treatment may have produced heterogeneous 

nucleation of PP on fibres surface, prompting the formation of larger crystals, 

heterogeneously distributed, thus conferring more conspicuous rigidity to the sample.

7.3.1.2. Leaching tests 

i) PEG samples 

After analysing additives fixation on fibres, upon UHP treatment, its retention upon 

leaching was also studied. Samples were subjected to 3 h leaching in distilled water, under 

stirring and at room temperature. Aliquots were collected from time to time and analysed 

by HPLC for PEG samples and UV-Vis, for orthophosphate content, as regards PP 

samples. 

Results for the different PEG impregnation samples are given in Figure 7. 1. Overall, 

results revealed a higher release of additives for UHP treated samples, than for those 

without UHP treatment. As expected UHP treated samples released more additives during 

leaching relatively to non-treated samples. This result confirms the presence of higher 

amounts of PEG in pulp, after UHP treatment, than after conventional impregnation. 

As concerns PEG 200 impregnated pulp samples, the quantification of PEG 200 

release, from both non-treated and UHP treated samples, was performed considering the 

sum of all molecular fractions (7 fractions), presented in PEG 200 (broad Mw distribution) 

(Figure 7. 2). The contribution to the leaching of each fraction was also analysed at the end 

of the 3h leaching period, to perceive which molecular weights were more prone to be 

leached, or were retained on fibres (Figure 7. 3). Each number of fraction (F1-F7) roughly 

corresponds to the oligomers (from monomer to heptamers).

comparison, it is also presented the distribution of fractions in a PEG 200 standard solution with 1% (w/v) concentration. 

The terminology used in Figure 7.2 to designate fractions was the same, although, in this case F1+2 represents fraction 1 

and 2. 

The results in Figure 7. 3 showed clearly the discrimination effect of different PEG 

oligomers retention on cellulosic fibres. Relatively small PEG molecules (monomers-

dimers) were much easily to release during leaching than the bigger oligomers. PEG 

molecules from fractions F5-F7 were preferentially retained on fibres during leaching. It 

can be also concluded that PEG molecules from fractions F5-F7 were easily leached from 

the pulp samples impregnated with PEG 200, under UHP conditions. This fact may be 

tentatively explained by the better accessibility of PEG 200 HP sample, than of PEG 200 

pulp sample, due to the less hornification during drying. Anyway, the results obtained 

showed that fibres interaction increases with increased molecular weight of PEG, at least 

up to heptamers. 

This case scenario discrimination effect was only possible to analyse for PEG200 

only, because it was the only PEG exhibiting a well-defined molecule weight distribution 

of oligomers. However, the same study was not possible to carry out for samples 

impregnated by PEG 400 and PEG 600, because of limited resolution of either HPLC or 

SEC (size exclusion chromatography) columns to separate individual oligomers. 

ii) PP samples 

The leaching of PP from samples impregnated with and without UHP, was monitored 

by analysing content of orthophosphates in solution (Figure 7. 4). The results revealed 

lower PP release from PP HP sample, relatively to PP pulp sample. Such result was 



 

~ 228 ~ 

 

 Chapter VII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Humectants 

expected and is in agreement with a lower amount of PP attached to fibres, upon UHP 

treatment, as was observed from mass balance results (Table 7. 3). 

 

Figure 7. 4 –PP release profiles from PP impregnated pulp samples, with and without UHP treatment (PP HP and 

PP respectively). 

7.3.1.3. Moisture sorption 

The capacity of impregnated samples to uptake moisture was also investigated, under 

room conditions (20±1ºC and ca. 50% RH). The results obtained are shown in Figure 7. 5. 

The results revealed higher moisture uptake for all samples, comparatively to control pulp 

(E), except for sample PEG 600 HP. This last exhibited a Xeq lower than that of untreated 

pulp (E), conversely to PEG 600 sample, whose Xeq was higher than E. The remaining 

samples, all demonstrated higher Xeq, which was further boosted upon UHP, up to the 

double of untreated pulp.  

Although samples impregnated with PEG200 exhibited rather promising results, 

results with PEG 400, after UHP treatment were even more impressive.

 Chapter VII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Humectants 

Moisture uptake results could also be considered as a way to measure the efficiency 

of additive impregnation. The purpose of humectants on fibres is to provide additional sites 

for moisture uptake and, therefore, to increase pulp affinity towards water. In the case of 

the three PEGs, the difference in Mw, between one another, may play an important role, not 

only on the impregnation efficiency (larger or smaller molecules are impregnated/retained 

less or more efficiently), but also from the point of view of moisture uptake (larger 

molecules interacting with cellulose could hinder their moisture uptake by free OH 

groups). 

It is important to select a humectant that allows a good fixation, together with a high 

capacity to uptake and retain moisture to produce smooth and moistened paper. Since, PEG 

400 Xeq was almost as elevated as PEG200, together with a good fixation capacity (similar 

to PEG 600), PEG 400 was selected for further studies.  

As concerns samples impregnated with PP, higher Xeq was found for UHP treated 

samples than for untreated ones. Which is inconsistent with the higher amount of additive 

on fibres. Probably, the fact that PP samples, without UHP, were very rigid, with non-

uniform PP distribution on the fibre surface, may explain a difficulty to uptake water. PP 

was possibly more uniformly distributed and hydrated, on the fibrils surface of pulp, due to 

UHP treatment, which promoted increased accessible area and high Xeq. Nevertheless, for 

testing other properties, such as physical and mechanical properties, a smaller additive load 

was considered to avoid abrupt PP precipitation on pulp.  

7.3.2. Papermaking properties of pulp impregnated with PEG and PP 

After preliminary tests for the pulps impregnation with different PEG and PP, the 

most advantageous additives, namely PEG 400 and PP, were selected for further evaluation 

of their effect on papermaking properties of modified pulps. The concentration of 

humectants in assays were diminished in order to approximate the industrial conditions and 

due to cost/efficiency reasons. Additionally, it was pertinent to test also the impregnation 

of mixed additives, namely PEG 400 with PP, to look for possible synergetic effects. The 

purpose of this study was to understand how these additives affect not only the interaction 

with water (moisture uptake, capillary rise, water absorption capacity), but also basic paper 

properties (ºSR, bulk, tensile strength, burst index, stretch%, tear index, air resistance and 

opacity). Initially the assays were carried out to access and evaluate the materials 

capability to sorption and then the papermaking properties were accessed.

7.3.2.1. Water sorption 

The water sorption was evaluated for all samples, by moisture sorption tests (20±1ºC 

and ca. 49% RH), capillary rise tests and water absorption capacity tests (basket immersion 

test). 

The moisture uptake of all samples impregnated with humectants (Figure 7. 6), with 

and without UHP treatment, exhibited a significant increase of Xeq, relatively to the control 

pulp (E). The highest water sorption was registered for samples treaded with 5% (/w/v) PP, 

especially under UHP conditions. Samples impregnated with 5% PP revealed the highest 

water sorption, even higher than with samples impregnated with 5% (w/v) PEG400, whose 

levels of water uptake were similar to those obtained with samples impregnated with 1% 

PP (w/v). Samples impregnated with 1% (w/v) PP were those with the highest water 

sorption, when compared to PEG samples. Among samples treated with and without UHP, 

it was possible to observe that only samples 5% PEG400 HP and Mixture HP revealed a 

lower Xeq, in relation with untreated samples (5% PEG 400 and Mixture, respectively). 

This divergence could be explained by the experimental error.

 Chapter VII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Humectants 

 The moisture uptake assays were further complemented with Klemm capillary tests, 

and water absorption capacity tests, typically used in Renova mill to scrutinize the pulps 

hydration skills. It was found that not always samples impregnated upon UHP resulted on 

increased capillarity, and that results were somehow divergent between one another. 

Overall, the impregnation with humectants showed similar or some increased capillarity of 

pulp (Figure 7. 7). This was expectable due to the addition of hydrophilic additives to 

fibres. However, in case of UHP treated samples, results diverged between one another. In 

some cases, UHP slightly improved capillarity (1% PP HP, 5% PEG HP and Mixture HP), 

while in other cases this one was reduce (5% PP HP and 1% PEG HP). A possible 

explanation is related to the eventual balance between improved hydrophilicity of fibres 

and the final macroporosity, affected by pulp modification. 

 The water absorption capacity (Figure 7. 8) is a standard procedure in Renova mill to 

acess papers hydration skills. The results achieved revealed that all UHP treated samples 

exhibited higher water absorption capacity, than untreated ones. This was not always in 

agreement with moisture sorption tests (Figure 7. 6). Though the divergences were 

minimal. It is noteworthy that 1% PP sample (with and without UHP treatment) 

demonstrated the same level of sorption as 5% PP (without UHP), and these results are not 

far from samples treated with a mixture of both PEG and PP. 

 The evaluation of samples hydration skills, demonstrated that the use of humectants 

to improve fibres hygroscopicity gave positive results, with special emphasis for samples 

impregnated with 5% PP, followed by 1% PP and mixture of PEG with PP. Practically in 

all assays the hydration properties inserted by humectants were enhanced by UHP 

treatment, though not always very significantly. 

7.3.2.2. Physical and Mechanical properties of modified pulps 

Physical and mechanical properties were studied using unbeaten pulps. All samples 

were tested and its basic indices were examined (drainability, bulk, burst index, tensile 

strength, stretch %, tear index, air resistance and opacity). 

i) Pulps doped with PEG 

The results obtained for samples impregnated with PEG are presented in Table 7. 5. 

Results on non impregnated pulp, treated with and without UHP (E and EHP) are also 

depicted for comparative reasons and the differences in physical parameters are expressed 

with respect to reference pulp E.

* The increment of strength properties after impregnation, with or without, UHP pre-treatment were calculated with 

respect to pulp E (? %).  

It was found that the impregnation of fibres with PEG diminished the strength of 

paper (decreases on tensile strength, burst and tear index). In the case of pulp samples 

impregnated with the highest load of PEG, this loss on strength properties was the highest, 

relatively to samples impregnated with lower PEG loads. However, this deterioration of 

strength properties was always diminished, while UHP processing of pulp was applied in 

the impregnation assays with humectants. 

Samples impregnated with 5% (w/v) PEG contained a higher amount of PEG400, 

comparatively with samples treated with 1% (w/v) PEG. In this case PEG should play a 

role of debonding agent, which contributes for an easier disruption of fibres network 

(losses on strength properties).
[7,18–20]

 Although UHP treatment benefits the improvement 

of paper strength, the losses in mechanical properties were still significant when compared 

to initial pulp (E). 

Decreasing PEG load, although it resulted in small losses on water uptake abilities, it 

allowed to reduce the impact of PEG on fibres strength properties. Nevertheless, fibres 

impregnated with UHP treatment were able, not only to reduce remarkably the interference 

brought by PEG on fibres strength properties, but also, in some cases, to improve in small 

percentages those properties. It is possible that the decrease of PEG load, together with 

UHP treatment effects may have contributed to keep or even improve, somehow, fibre 

interbonding. This fact is endorsed by air resistance results. An increased PEG load, even 

upon UHP, rendered lower air resistance, which suggests higher porosity, whereas in case 

of samples treated with low amount of PEG (1% (w/v)), fibres become more strongly

linked and organized, as demonstrated by the increase on handsheets air resistance. 

Besides, adding PEG to fibres rendered and increased higher bulk.  

Even though the undesirable effect brought by PEG it was possible to improve fibres 

water uptake, without harm significantly strength properties. Using a moderate PEG 

concentration (1% (w/v)) it was possible to reach fairly good water absorptivity (Figure 7. 

6 – 7.8), without serious deterioration of mechanical strength (Table 7. 5).

* The increment of strength properties after impregnation, with or without, UHP pre-treatment were calculated with 

respect to pulp E (? %).  

It was found that PP impregnation, with 5% (w/v) concentration resulted on the 

significant decrease of handsheets strength properties, whereas with lower PP loadings (1% 

(w/v)) positive effects would be achieved upon PP impregnation. This last, would also be 

enhanced upon UHP treatment. The effect of UHP was insignificant when fibres were 

impregnated with 5% (w/v) PP solutions. The decrease on strength properties may be 

related with interference of PP precipitated particles on fibres surface, in considerable 

amount to hinder inter-fibres interaction, as the case of fillers in papermaking.
[21]

 

In the case of samples impregnated with 1% (w/v) PP concentration, the opposite 

effect was registered, with and without UHP treatment. Strength properties such as tensile 

strength, burst and tear index, demonstrated significant improvements, which were even 

higher upon UHP treatment. It is possible that with small concentrations of PP, this 

compound conforms to fibre and hinder interfibre bonding.

 Chapter VII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Humectants 

Air resistance results for samples impregnated with 1% (w/v) concentration of PP 

rendered higher air resistance values, which are in agreement with a less porous and more 

organized/tightly packed fibres structure. On the other hand, high PP concentration 

originated the opposite results, which were explained by disordering PP effect of fibre 

bonding. The addition of salt like additive did not affect greatly pulp drainability, although 

in same cases a small decrease was found. As concerns the pulp’s bulk, as expected, the 

addition of inorganic additives induced an increase of bulk. 

The pulp impregnation with 1%PP (w/v) solution, under UHP, promoted not only 

fibres hydrophilicity, but also basic papermaking properties. Nevertheless, in terms of 

paper softness, it is noteworthy that PEG treated samples were softer to touch, than PP 

treated samples. Moreover, these last revealed to be problematic upon handsheets 

production due to its stickiness towards the handsheets dryer. Considering the benefits and 

the disadvantages of both PEG and PP additives, it was thought that the mixture of both 

could results on good hydration properties, together with less problems related to strength 

properties. 

iii) Pulps doped with mixture of humectants 

The effect on fibres impregnation with a PEG and PP mixture was also studied and 

the results achieved are presented in Table 7. 7.

The results revealed a small variation on strength properties, being the most 

conspicuous the shifts on tensile strength and stretch (%). It is possible that the use of both

 Chapter VII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Humectants 

additives in small dosage attenuated the negative effects previously seen, in higher 

loadings, individually, due to less interference with interfibre bonding. 

It is noteworthy the increases found not only due the combination of PEG and PP, 

but also upon UHP treatments. These last were especially noticeable on burst and tear 

index, suggesting that fibres network were fortified by both additives, especially after UHP 

treatment (fibril disaggregation, increased accessibility and uniform dispersion of 

additives). The results on air resistance supported the aforementioned statements, as the 

increases were found in treatment assays, with and without UHP, unveiling a less porous 

and more efficiently packed fibres. In terms of opacity no significant changes were 

registered, which is indicative of a low interference of additives on papers opacity. 

From the results achieved for all formulations, the samples that exhibited the best 

performance in terms of hydration skills and strength properties, were samples 

impregnated with 1%PP (w/v), followed by samples impregnated by the mixture of PEG 

and PP. Although the first yielded better results, its hand sheets exhibited higher roughness 

to touch, relatively to samples impregnated with mixture of humectants, which in terms of 

tissue paper production constitutes a rather relevant issue.

 Chapter VII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Humectants 

7.4. Conclusions 

The positive effect of UHP on the impregnation of humectants in fibres was 

demonstrated. Overall, it was possible to observe higher sorption of these additives into 

fibres, upon UHP treatment. Besides, it was demonstrated that during UHP treatment of 

water soluble polymeric humectants (PEG), a discrimination effect on the sorption of 

oligomers of different molecular weight was observed. This fact affected strongly the 

retention of PEG on fibres. 

Increased hydration skills were achieved for samples impregnated with humectants, 

which were further enhanced by UHP treatment. The use of humectants, such as PEG 400 

and PP demonstrated the possibility of improving the hydration properties of fibres with 

increased moisture capture abilities and absorptivity by soaking in water. Additionally, it 

was found that even though these additives improved the hydration abilities of pulp, they 

also affect negatively strength properties, which required an optimization of the 

humectants formulation applied. These negative effects were assigned to interferences 

brought by additive on interactions between fibres that weakens their interfibre bonds. 

Finally, by varying the additive loads it was possible to attenuate the 

abovementioned negative effects, on pulp strength properties, or even improving them. 

These variations were possibly related with a more controlled dispersion of additives, 

enough to avoid their interference with fibre bonding, while, at the same time, keeping 

high hydration properties. 

It was also concluded that the formulation that enabled the best hydration/strength 

pulp properties was 1%PP (w/v), followed by mixture of both PP (0.5% (w/v)) and PEG 

(0.5% (w/v)), both subjected to UHP treatment.

 Chapter VIII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Antimicrobial agents 

8.1. Introduction 

On nowadays modern society, antimicrobial finishing of materials has been gaining 

growing relevance. 
[1,2]

 Redefining tissue products to enhance hygiene is a way to 

minimize and contain the spreading of harmful microorganisms. An example of this would 

be Cascades® Antibacterial Towels. 
[3,4]

 In the case of natural fibres, such as cellulose, 

they exhibit a tendency to microorganism’s growth, such as bacteria and fungi. These 

microorganisms are easily found almost everywhere and are able to multiply quickly when 

their basic needs are met, such as moisture, nutrients and temperature.
[1,5]

  

The use of antimicrobial agents provides protection against pathogens and other 

microorganisms, which could origin either medical or hygienic problems. These 

antimicrobial agents differ in terms of chemical structure, effectiveness, method of 

application, its impact on humans and on the environment, as well as in its cost.
[1,2]

 

To achieve the desired effect, an ideal antimicrobial agent should gather a few 

requirements, such as be effective against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, while 

displaying low toxicity to consumers. It should also be durable (be active for a long period 

of time) and compatible with the chemical and technological processes, in which it will be 

included. It also should be cost effective and not harmful to either the manufacturer or the 

environment. 
[5,6]

 

An example of an effective antimicrobial agent is polyhexamethylene biguanide 

(PHMB), which is a cationic polymer with cationic biguanide repeating units separated by 

hydrocarbon chain blocks of identical or dissimilar length. PHMB is a strong and broad 

spectrum antimicrobial agent with low toxicity, features that have attracted the attention 

for antimicrobial finishing in textile industry. This compound is frequently used as a 

disinfectant in the food industry and in the sanitization of swimming pools. It was also 

explored as a biocide in mouthwashes and wound dressings. 
[1,5,7,8]

 

In order to embody antimicrobial properties to cellulosic materials, these may be 

functionalized with antimicrobial materials either in bulk or by addition of encapsulated 

antimicrobial agents. This last strategy may result in improvements on the controlled 

delivery of these compounds and improve their activity. This method also aims to reduce 

the amount of antimicrobial agent applied (more efficient utilization) and to decrease 

negative effect of the final product, such as undesired variations of products properties 

(due to the interactions of the antimicrobial with the product matrix) or secondary effects 

to consumers (e.g. skin irritation), etc.
[9–12]

 Chapter VIII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Antimicrobial agents 

Ultra-Hydrostatic high pressure, UHP emerges here, similarly to previous studies, as 

a prominent technique enhancing cellulosic fibres accessibility and thus facilitating 

chemicals implementation in fibres.
[13–15]

 Accordingly, the main purpose of this work 

consisted in the impregnation of fibres with antimicrobial agent PHMB, with and without 

UHP treatment. The effects on UHP treatment on pulp impregnation with PHMB solution 

was evaluated in terms of antimicrobial properties of processed pulp and PHMB leaching 

in aqueous solutions. Additionally, the impregnation of cellulosic fibres, with and without 

UHP, with encapsulated PHMB was also investigated.

8.2 Materials and Methods 

Similar to previous studies on the impregnation of additives, the raw material used 

was virgin hardwood pulp. As depicted before, this raw material was used as reference to 

avoid irregularities coming from the variability of recycled pulps lots. Thus, conventional 

industrial bleached E. globulus kraft pulp and an antimicrobial agent, (poly(hexamethylene 

biguanide) hydrochloride), PHMB (20% (w/w) solution, Arch UK Biocides), were kindly 

supplied by Renova FPA, SA. and used in the impregnation tests.

For samples preparation, pulp was dispersed in PHMB solutions with different 

PHMB concentrations (0.5, 0.1, 0.01% and 0.001% (w/v)), resulting of 2% consistency 

pulp suspensions. For each PHMB load, two samples were prepared, one was subjected to 

UHP treatment (500 MPa, 10 min), while the other was subjected to agitation, under 

atmospheric pressure (reference). The UHP conditions were the same as suggested 

previously for the impregnation of other additives (500 MPa, 10 min). In the case of 

samples treated with UHP (0.5% HP, 0.1% HP, 0.01% HP and 0.001%HP), the pulp 

suspensions, with corresponding amount of PHMB, were placed into HDPE containers, 

sealed and then submitted to UHP (500 MPa, 10 min) on a Hyperbaric model 55 

equipment. On the other hand, samples impregnated without UHP (0.5%, 0.1%, 0.01% and 

0.001%), were left stirring for 10 min (the same time spent in the UHP treatment).

 Chapter VIII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Antimicrobial agents 

After the impregnation with PHMB solution, a part of the samples was filtered, air 

dried and then kept on a desiccator over P2O5 (0% relative humidity), while the other was 

employed in the preparation of standard handsheets. For comparative reasons, pulp 

samples without PHMB were also considered. Thus, pulp without any kind of treatment 

(without PHMB addition and without UHP treatment), was designated Control, and the 

pulp without addition of PHMB and subjected to UHP (2%, consistency, 500 MPa, 10 

min), was designated as Control HP. 

 

8.2.2 PHMB silica capsules. 

? Ammonia solution (25 –28%, Sigma-Aldrich) 

? Span® 85 (Sigma-Aldrich) 

? Tween® 20 (Sigma-Aldrich),  

? Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich)  

? Cyclohexane 99.9% (Merck).  

Silica capsules with PHMB were prepared according with a previously developed 

method 
[16]

, through reverse emulsion, using Span
®
85 and Tween

®
20 as surfactants, 

cyclohexane as co-solvent and an ammonia solution as catalyst. An oil phase was prepared 

by dissolving 1 g of Span®85 in 50 mL of cyclohexane. Afterwards, one drop of 

Tween
®
20 in 5 mL of PHMB solution, followed by the addition of 2.0 mL of ammonia 

solution (25–28%) (water phase), were added to the oil phase under stirring and a water-in-

oil micro-emulsion was achieved. After a few minutes stirring, 2.0 mL of TEOS was added 

to the w/o micro-emulsion under vigorous stirring and kept in a closed vessel for 24 h. The 

precipitate was then filtered, washed with cyclohexane and dried at 60
o
C.  

To test capsules stability towards UHP treatment a diluted solutions of capsules (1 

mL) was subjected to UHP (500 MPa, 10 min, on a hyperbaric model 55, Burgos, Spain, 

apparatus). The samples were analysed before and after the treatment by SEM analysis. 

8.2.2.1 Impregnation with PHMB capsules 

Pulp suspensions were impregnated with PHMB silica capsules. 2.5 g of pulp were 

dispersed in distilled water (2% consistency). After thoroughly dispersed, PHMB silica 

capsules were added making up a concentration of 0.1% (w/v) of capsules in solution. 

Two sets of samples were prepared, one destined for UHP treatment and another for 

impregnation solely by stirring. The first one was placed on a HDPE container, sealed and 

then subjected to UHP treatment (on a Hyperbaric model 55 equipment) during 10 min at

500 MPa, while the other was left stirring during the same time. Afterwards both samples 

were filtered, air dried and stored on a desiccator under P2O5. 

8.2.3 Leaching tests 

Leaching tests were performed (in duplicate) to investigate the release behaviour of 

PHMB from cellulosic fibres. 1 g of sample was weighted and placed into a beaker, 

already filled with 100 mL of distilled water, under stirring. Aliquots of solution were 

collected from time to time and analysed by UV-Vis spectroscopy.  

8.2.3.1 PHMB quantification 

The PHMB released during the leaching tests was monitored by UV-Vis 

spectroscopy, on an UV-vis spectrophotometer Evolution 220 (Thermo Scientific). 

Standard PHMB aqueous solutions were prepared (1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20 mg/L), and its 

absorbance at 234 nm was measured, and used to derive a calibration curve correlating 

absorbance with PHMB concentration. The calibration curve is represented on Appendice 

F. 

8.2.4 Handsheets preparation 

Standard handsheets were prepared following ISO 5269-2:2004, on a Rapid-Köthen 

sheet former (Karl Schröder KG) 

8.2.5 Physical and mechanical properties 

Fibres drainability was evaluated by analysing the Schopper-Riegler degree 

according to ISO 5267-1:1999. Thickness, density and specific volume of prepared 

handsheets were evaluated according to ISO 534:2011. Tensile strength, stretch, tear index, 

burst index and air resistance (Gurley method), were evaluated following ISO 1924-

2:2008, ISO 1974:2012, ISO 2758:2014, and ISO 5636-5:2013 norms, respectively. 

Opacity of handsheets were determined following ISO 2471:2008 using Elrepho tester 

(Lorentzen &amp;amp; Wettre). 

8.2.6 Solid UV-vis reflectance  

UV-vis diffuse reflectance (UV-vis DR, k/s) spectra were recorded on a UV-vis 

spectrophotometer Evolution 220 (Thermo Scientific) equipped by an ISA-220 reflectance 

accessory using BaSO4 as background reference at scan velocity of 200 nm/min.

8.2.7 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 

SEM (scanning electron microscopy) analysis of capsules was also performed in 

scanning electron microscope Hitachi S4100 at an accelerating voltage of 25 kV on carbon 

sputtered samples. For this analysis a diluted dispersion of capsules was prepared and 

deposited on a silica lamella, previously attached to a SEM support with carbon tape. Then 

samples were carbon sputtered, previously to SEM analysis. 

In the case of handsheets of pulp impregnated with capsules, those were analysed in 

the same equipment at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. In this case small pieces of sample 

were attached to a SEM support by carbon tape and then subjected to Au/Pd sputtering 

before SEM analysis. 

8.2.8 Fourier transform infrared - FTIR 

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the paper samples were collected using 

a spectrometer Bruker optics tensor 27 coupled to a horizontal attenuated total reflectance 

(ATR) cell, using 256 scans at a resolution of 4 cm
-1

. The spectres were normalized 

according with 2900cm

The antimicrobial activity was assessed by a quantitative test towards a gram-

negative bacteria Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and a gram-positive bacteria Listeria

 Chapter VIII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Antimicrobial agents 

innocua (ATCC 33090). The quantitative analyses were performed based on the 

methodology present in the NP EN ISO 20743:2007 norm, being used the transfer method. 

It consists on an evaluation method in which the test bacteria are placed on an agar plate 

and transferred onto paper samples of 38 mm diameter. The target microorganisms used in 

these trials were: Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Listeria innocua (ATCC 33090). 

For each sample analysis with possible antimicrobial activity was carried another one, to 

the respective control sample (without UHP treatment and/or without PHMB). All samples 

were analysed in triplicate. In order to transfer the microorganisms to the target paper 

samples, 1.0 mL of a suspension at 1x10
6
 – 3x10

6
 CFU/ml was spread on the surface of a 

TSA plate (the excess was removed), and then samples were set forth the inoculum over 1 

min. After that period, one sample (in triplicate) was microbiologically evaluated (0 hours 

of incubation) while another one, in triplicate, was closed in petri plates (without any agar) 

and remained 24 h at 37 ºC being analysed.  

The microbiological analyses of the sample consisted in the paper sample washing 

inside a stomacher bag with a neutralizing solution over 2 minutes using a Stomacher 80 

(Seward), and a consequently series decimal dilution of the resulting washing residue (with 

0.1% Peptone Salt Solution) was performed, being plated 1.0 mL on PCA for E. coli and L. 

innocua. Afterwards, the plates were incubated at 37 ± 1 ºC for L. innocua and E. coli, 36 - 

48 hours and 24 h respectively. 

In all cases, Petri dishes containing 30–300 colony forming units (CFU) were 

selected for counting and the value of Log CFU for each paper sample was calculated with 

Equation 8.1, where CB is the microbial load concentration per mL (CFU/mL), Z is the 

mean value of CFU/mL in the triplicated microbiological analysis and R is the dilution 

factor used for the bacterial enumeration; and Equation 8.2 where M is the bacterial 

number per test piece and V the volume of the neutralizing solution added in the washing 

process.

8.3 Results and Discussion 

8.3.1 Impregnation of PHMB 

As in previous studies of impregnation with other additives, conventional industrial 

bleached E. globulus pulp, was impregnated with 0.1 and 0.5% (w/v) PHMB solutions, 

with and without UHP treatment. The samples designations were the same as presented in 

Table 8. 1. 

The abovementioned samples were analysed by UV-Vis diffusive reflectance and 

their spectres are represented in Figure 8. 1. Looking into both sets of spectra it was 

possible to observe that samples subjected to UHP exhibited higher intensity at 234 nm 

(characteristic band of PHMB
[17]

) comparatively to untreated samples. Interestingly, in 

case of samples impregnated with 0.1% (w/v) solution this difference became even more 

noticeable, than after impregnation with 0.5% (w/v) solution. These results evidenced that 

samples, impregnated with UHP treatment exhibited a higher amount of PHMB, than pulp 

samples impregnated with PHMB solution without UHP. This fact was attributed to 

improved accessibility of fibres, upon UHP treatment that favoured PHMB adsorption on 

fibres. This improvement was particularly notable at low concentrations of PHMB in 

solution, when static sorption on fibre surface was not so significant.

(a) (b) 

Figure 8. 2 – PHMB release profiles, in water, from samples impregnated with 0.1 (a) and 0.5%(w/v) PHMB solution 

(b), with (0.1% HP and 0.5% HP) and without UHP (0.1% and 0.5%). 

The release profiles of PHMB revealed a decreasing of it removal, from samples 

subjected to UHP treatment, when compared to untreated samples. Additionally, this 

difference was even more evident for samples treated with a higher PHMB concentration 

(0.5% (w/v) PHMB solution).  

These results diverge from the results achieved in the previous chapter (Chapter 7), 

where UHP induced higher uptake of humectants, accompanied by an accelerated additive 

release in water. It is proposed that positively charged PHMB interacts strongly with 

negatively charged cellulosic fibres. Additionally, due to improved fibres accessibility, 

upon UHP treatment, PHMB penetrates deep inside fibres structure favouring the 

formation of strong interactions with cellulose. These facts may contribute to the improved 

retention of PHMB. However, with increasing PHMB concentration in solution, the 

interactions by hydrogen bonds, between PHMB molecules, start playing an important 

role, leading to multilayer sorption on cellulosic fibres surface.
[5,7,18]

 Therefore it is 

plausible that, for high PHMB loading, PHMB attached to fibres surface is bound to fibres 

by weak forces, and therefore its leaching becomes more easy in aqueous medium, when 

compared to fibres treated with low PHMB loads (predominance of ionic interactions). 

8.3.1.2 Physico-mechanical properties 

Considering the samples investigated so far, a set of samples was selected for further 

scrutiny, namely the ones treated with the low PHMB load (0.1% and 0.1% HP). Thus, 

handsheets of these were prepared and analysed for its physical and mechanical properties. 

The main purpose was to perceive how PHMB would interfere on the fibres properties and, 

at the same time, evaluate the effect of UHP treatment on the same properties. With this in 

mind the following samples were analysed: pulp without UHP treatment (E); pulp solely 



 

~ 252 ~ 

 

 Chapter VIII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Antimicrobial agents 

treated by UHP treatment (EHP); pulp impregnated with PHMB without UHP treatment 

(0.1%); and pulp impregnated with PHMB and UHP treatment (0.1% HP). The results are 

presented in Table 8. 2. The data collected from both sets of samples, impregnated with 

PHMB, revealed significant losses in paper strength (tensile strength, burst and tear index) 

accompanied by slight gains on bulk and opacity. The losses in strength properties were 

more accentuated on samples impregnated with UHP treatment, than without UHP 

application. 

It is known, from the literature, that PHMB (cationic polymer) interacts strongly with 

cellulose (negatively charged polymer) through ionic interactions and hydrogen bonds.
[7]

 It 

is possible that by bounding with cellulose, PHMB interferes in fibres interactions 

(bonding), weakening the fibres network and therefore affecting paper’s strength 

properties. This behaviour has been observed in paper for other additives of similar nature, 

such as debonding agents. These additives include cationic polymers (e.g. quaternary 

ammonium compounds) used to decrease fibre interbonding, and thus increase paper 

softness.
[19–22]

 From this point of view it may be suggested that PHMB hinders interfibre 

bonding, conveying poor paper strength properties. Since UHP treatment promote PHMB 

sorption on fibres, the strength properties are particularly affected. 

The decrease on air resistance of samples containing PHMB implies a material with 

higher porosity (more void space between fibres) and, therefore, less bonding area. 

Additionally, the small decrease found on ºSR further supports the reduction of interactions 

between fibres and, therefore, an easier water draining. Variation in bulk was expectable 

due to the diminished fibres bonding capacity.

 Chapter VIII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Antimicrobial agents 

Due to the loss of pulp strength properties, as a result of PHMB interference, it was 

interesting to study if decreasing PHMB load would attenuate such negative effects. To 

evaluate this possibility, new samples and handsheets were prepared with decreased 

PHMB loads (pulp treated with 0.01% (w/v) and 0.001% (w/v) PHMB solutions), with and 

without UHP treatment. The designations of samples were the same as presented in Table

 *All calculations were performed with respect to pulp E. 

The obtained results are depicted in Table 8. 3. The pulp samples impregnated with 

diluted PHMB solutions (0.01% and 0.001% (w/v) PHMB solutions), revealed, in general, 

attenuated negative effects on their strength properties. This, however, was not the case of 

tear resistance, which increased. Since less molecules of PHMB are attached to fibres, less 

interference may be expected on the interfibre bonding. Thus, it is possible that the 

disruption of fibres network did not occur as easily as before, with relatively high 

concentration of PHMB in solution. This was mirrored by the small losses in strength 

properties of pulps with adsorbed PHMB (Table 8. 3). Moreover, it was also possible to 

observe an increase of tear resistance of pulps containing PHMB, especially for UHP 

processed pulp samples.  

It was also not possible to conclude the role of UHP with different PHMB 

concentrations due to divergence in results between samples treated with 0.01% and 

0.001% (w/v) PHMB solutions. With 0.01% (w/v) PHMB in solution, the negative effect 

imparted by antimicrobial agent was further attenuated, upon UHP treatment, whereas with 

0.001% (w/v) PHMB solution the opposite trend was observed. This could be the result of 

a balance between the improved impregnation of PHMB by UHP and UHP effect on fibres 

(forced hydration, fibrils disaggregation, increased accessibility, etc.). Even though the 



 

~ 254 ~ 

 

 Chapter VIII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Antimicrobial agents 

decrease on PHMB load attenuated the negative impact on strength properties, it may 

affect papers antimicrobial features. Hence, it was necessary to evaluate and confirm 

samples antimicrobial activity. 

8.3.1.3 Antimicrobial activity 

The antimicrobial ability of samples treated with different loadings of PHMB, was 

evaluated. The effect of the UHP treatment (500 MPa, 10 min) was also considered. 

Samples E (control) and EHP (control HP) were used as the control samples, thus taking 

into consideration not only the pulp itself, but also the effect of UHP on pulp. The tests 

were performed both on gram-positive and gram positive bacteria. 

The method followed to analyse the antimicrobial activity of the above samples was 

based on the NP EN ISO 20743 norm, considering the following microorganisms: 

? Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 

? Listeria innocua ATCC 33090 

This method is based on the transfer of microorganisms into the samples, through 

contact between the inoculum and the sample. This method is widely used to evaluate the 

antimicrobial activity in textile products, fibres, yarn, among others.  

The first tests were carried out with E. coli, and the results obtained are displayed in 

Figure 8. 3. 

 

Figure 8. 3 – Results from the evaluation on the antimicrobial activity on samples subjected to the microorganism E. coli. 

As expected it was noticeable that control samples did not hold any antimicrobial 

activity, as confirmed by the increase of Log CFU/specimen from 4.27±0.17 to 8.48±0.01, 

after a 24-hour incubation period. A similar behaviour was also observed for control HP 

sample in the same range of values.

 Chapter VIII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Antimicrobial agents 

Samples treated with high PHMB concentrations (0.1% e 0.01% (w/v)), with and 

without UHP treatment, clearly exhibited antimicrobial activity. This was quite evident by 

the values ?1.00 Log CFU/specimen, already on zero time. Moreover, the same samples 

did not exhibited growth during incubation. As regards the samples treated with the lowest 

PHMB concentration (0.001% (w/v)), the observed behaviour was different. A notable 

microbial growth was observed during the incubation period from 3.57±0.04 to 7.15±0.18 

Log CFU/ specimen and from 3.69±0.18 to 7.47±0.29 Log CFU/ specimen, for the samples 

impregnated without UHP treatment, and for the sample subjected to UHP treatment in 

PHMB solution, respectively. 

The same analysis was performed with microorganism Listeria innocua and the 

results obtained are presented in Figure 8. 4. 

 
Figure 8. 4 - Results from the evaluation on the antimicrobial activity on samples subjected to the microorganism L. 

innocua. 

The results with L. innocua were quite similar to those obtained with E.coli. control 

and control HP samples displayed an increase from 5.63±0.03 to 9.81±0.01 Log 

CFU/specimen, and from 5.59±0.35 to 9.75±0.26 Log CFU/specimen, respectively. It was 

demonstrated that samples treated with more concentrated PHMB solutions (0.1% and 

0.01% (w/v), with and without UHP), on time zero, already exhibited values of ?1.00 Log 

CFU/specimen. Microorganisms growth during the incubation period was not observed. 

Only for samples treated with lower PHMB concentrations (0.001% (w/v)), the 

microorganism’s growth was observed during the incubation time from 5.51±0.11 to 

9.75±0.02 Log CFU/specimen on the sample without UHP treatment, and from 5.39±0.48 

to 9.82±0.10 Log CFU/specimen, for UHP treated samples. 

The differences observed between PHMB concentrations, as regards the 

antimicrobial activity on paper samples, is mainly related with the higher amount of 

PHMB required to avoid the growth of microorganisms. The PHMB in paper samples

 Chapter VIII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Antimicrobial agents 

treated with low PHMB concentrations may not be in range of the minimum required 

PHMB load to convey antimicrobial action. Therefore, for future applications, as regards 

both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, pulp treatment with both 0.1% and 0.01% 

(w/v) of PHMB solution may be sufficient for paper to display clear antibacterial 

properties. Nevertheless, it seems that the PHMB concentration of 0.01% (w/v) is 

preferable because of the minimal effect on the physical properties of pulp (Table 8. 3). 

8.3.2 Impregnation with silica capsules 

The functionalization of cellulosic fibres was also performed with PHMB 

encapsulated in silica capsules. The main purpose of this tests were to testing the capsules 

ability to be attached to fibres along with its antimicrobial activity potential, with and 

without UHP treatment. The capsules used in these tests were prepared and characterized 

by collaborators and had the same features of those in the literature.
[16]

 PHMB capsules 

had diameters ranging from 270 nm to 1 ?m, with a thickness of approximately 45 nm and 

estimated PHMB content of ca. 24% (w/w). 
[16]

 

Before the impregnation tests, silica capsules with PHMB were tested against UHP 

(500 MPa, 10 min), to evaluate the particles ability to maintain its integrity and stability 

towards high pressure environment. SEM (scan electron microscopy) images were 

obtained before and after the UHP treatment (500 MPa, 10 min) (Figure 8. 5). The SEM 

images revealed the integrity of capsules upon UHP treatment.

The impregnation tests with capsules containing PHMB were carried out using the 

same cellulosic pulp and a capsules suspension of 0.1% (w/v). Two sets of samples were 

obtained, one impregnated with UHP (PHMB CPs HP) and another impregnated solely by 

stirring (PHMB CPs). To evaluate the deposition and distribution of capsules on cellulosic

fibres, SEM analysis was carried out (Figure 8. 6) The acquired images clearly showed the 

capsules in both PHMB CPs and PHMB CPs HP samples. This observation is in agreement 

with a good interaction between cellulosic fibres and PHMB capsules, possibly due to 

capsules positive charge surface, suggested previously. 
[16]

Figure 8. 6 –SEM images of cellulosic fibres impregnated with silica capsules, without UHP (a) and with UHP 

treatment (b). 

The functionalization of fibres with PHMB capsules was also confirmed by FTIR 

(Figure 8. 7). The FTIR spectres revealed a substantial increase at 1028cm
-1

, which was 

even more noticeable on the sample impregnated with UHP (PHMB CPs HP). This 

increase is related to the presence of PHMB silica capsules, namely to the vibrations of Si-

O-Si stretching, from silica,
[16]

 which prompted a significant increment on the a typical 

cellulose band attributed to the vibrations of C-O groups. The high intensity at 1028cm
-1

, 

showed by the spectra of samples treated by UHP suggest the presence of a significant 

amount of silica capsules with PHMB. This increase in capsules capture is most likely 

related to the UHP ability to improve fibres accessibility and to facilitate the silica capsules 

adsorption on fibres. 

Moreover, the aforementioned increases are also accompanied by an increase of 

intensity at 556cm
-1

. It is suggested that this increase may be associated with vibration 

from oxygen atoms from both silica capsules and cellulose.

with PHMB), PHMB CPs HP (fibres impregnated with capsules with PHMB by UHP treatment) and E (hardwood pulp). 

8.3.2.1 PHMB leaching 

The release of PHMB from functionalized cellulosic fibres was also studied. Thus, 

the release tests were performed in water at room temperature (25±2ºC). The achieved 

release profiles are presented in Figure 8. 8. The curves revealed a similar release profile, 

for both samples, until 20min. After 20 min the release of PHMB was higher from samples 

treated by UHP. This was consistent with the opposite behaviour exhibited by samples 

impregnated with non-encapsulated PHMB (Figure 8. 2). A possible explanation for such 

phenomena could be related with the fact that PHMB doesn’t interact with cellulose 

directly as in previous studies, due to its confinement in the silica capsules. This difference 

in scenario allows the diffusion of increased amounts of PHMB, during leaching into 

solution, because PHMB releases by controlled diffusion from capsules and is no longer 

hindered by its interaction with cellulose. Consequently, the higher amount of PHMB 

released by samples impregnated by UHP, indicates the presence of a higher amount of 

silica capsules attached to cellulosic fibres, as proposed by the FTIR results.  

Normally cellulosic fibres exhibit a negative charge over a wide pH range, due to the 

presence of ionisable moieties such as carboxyl and hydroxyl groups, resulting from 

chemical processing, or from minor polysaccharides such as glucuronoxylans. Similarly, 

silica surfaces in contact with neutral aqueous solutions are also negatively charged. 
[25,26]

 

However, the presence of PHMB (cationic polymer) in capsules (both encapsulated and on 

the shell pores) grants capsules a positively charged surface.
[16]

 This fact favours the 



 

~ 259 ~ 

 

 Chapter VIII | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Antimicrobial agents 

capsules interaction with cellulose instead of being repealed due to the coulombic 

repulsion.  

 

Figure 8. 8 – PHMB leaching profiles from PHMB CPs and PHMB CPs HP. 

PHMB release from capsules sorbed on fibres was further monitored up to 24 h. The 

amount released from each sample was determined and presented in Table 8. 4. According 

to the results obtained it is possible to observe that, even after 24h, PHMB continues to be 

released from both samples. However, once more, PHMB CPs HP demonstrated superior 

release of PHMB than PHMB CPs (ca. +66%).

HP 
294.6±12.0 

The leaching assay with PHMB CPs and PHMB CPs HP samples were not 

complemented with mechanical and physical tests, with paper samples, due to insufficient 

materials for handsheets preparation. Namely, the reduced amount of capsules that was 

available for the study, which only permitted the preparation of a limited number of 

handsheets used for antimicrobial activity tests. 

8.3.2.2 Antimicrobial activity 

Fibres functionalized with PHMB silica capsules were also tested for antimicrobial 

activity. Handsheets were prepared from both pulp samples. Handsheets of control sample 

(pulp impregnated with empty silica capsules) and control HP sample (pulp impregnated 

with empty silica capsules and UHP treatment) were also prepared.

The antimicrobial tests were performed according to norm NP EN ISSO 20743:2009 

with slight modifications, for the specimens E. coli and L. innocua. The results obtained 

are displayed above in Figures 8. 9a and 8.9b.

(b) 

Figure 8. 9 - Evaluation of the antimicrobial activity on samples subjected to the microorganism E. coli (a) and L. 

innocua (b). 

Using the microbiology tests it was possible to demonstrate the antimicrobial activity 

of both pulps doped with capsules, with two distinct microorganisms, after zero time and 

24 h of incubation at 37 ºC. 

These results suggest that both doped pulp samples, either with or without UHP 

treatment, possessed a minimal amount of PHMB necessary to inactivate microorganisms 

and thus inhibit its growth. It is possible that differences between the two doped pulps 

could be registered, if the PHMB amounts in the samples were lower than actually 

achieved, near the limiting load required to allow the antimicrobial activity.

8.4 Conclusions 

The results achieved demonstrated once more that UHP enabled an improved 

impregnation not only of chemicals, but also of silica capsules. An improved impregnation 

of cationic antimicrobial polymer PHMB was demonstrated, thanks to UHP treatment. 

PHMB was more strongly attached to cellulosic fibres due to deeper penetration of PHMB 

and stronger interaction with cellulosic fibres. Although upon treatment with higher 

PHMB dosages, a frailer multilayer of PHMB, formed on the fibres surface would 

contribute to its easier leaching. 

Nevertheless, even though UHP promoted positive results on PHMB impregnation, 

paper strength properties were negatively affected. These were posteriorly attenuated by 

reducing PHMB load in the impregnation assays, without affecting antimicrobial features. 

It is suggested that this negative effect of PHMB, on papers strength properties, could be 

reduced either by the use of encapsulated PHMB of by the addition of wet and dry 

strength agents (object for further studies). 

The impregnation of microencapsulated PHMB was also demonstrated. It was seen 

that UHP treatment also enhanced the impregnation of capsules. It was suggested that the 

capsules positive charge, together with UHP enhanced accessibility, played a role 

enhancing capsules impregnation. Also, in opposite to the impregnation with PHMB 

alone, the results demonstrated that since PHMB is no longer interacting directly with 

cellulose, its release is controlled by its diffusion from capsules. Additionally, both 

samples impregnated with and without UHP demonstrated antimicrobial activity, which 

suggested that both systems provided PHMB in sufficient amount to inhibit 

microorganism’s activity.

 Chapter IX | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Perfumes  

9.1. Introduction 

The development of new consumer appealing products, such as tissue papers, has 

lead companies to research for different additives and methods to produce differentiated 

and unique products. 
[1–3]

 This was highlighted for the case of coloured papers (Chapter 6) 

and papers with antimicrobial properties (Chapter 8) and is also true for the case of papers 

with specific odour. Human’s sense of smell identifies not only the quality of different 

odours, but also associates it, often unconsciously, with feelings ranging from agreeable to 

unpleasant associations. Relying on this many take advantage of it, since perfumed 

products become more attractive, while dreadful smells are used for the opposite effect. 
[4]

 

Ergo, it is possible that by appealing to consumer sense of odour a positively impact on its 

buying behaviour may be verified. 
[1]

 Many companies have followed this strategy through 

the years, to enhance brand equity, by developing scent based trademark products.
[5,6]

 An 

example of this would be Renova scented tissue papers. 

To confer an appealing smell of freshly washed fabric or of perfume to a substrate, 

this last is commonly treated by spraying, coating or dipping, with a perfume or fragrance. 

However, the effects of the fragrance on substrates, wear of rapidly. 
[6]

 

As a way to retain longer perfumes on substrate, encapsulation has emerged as a 

potential method to enhanced odour durability on perfumed products.
[6]

 Encapsulation 

confers protection to perfumes from surrounding adverse conditions (temperature, pH, 

water, etc), and thus enables a controlled and long perfume release.
[7–9]

 Furthermore 

encapsulation also facilitates perfumes handling, which is an attractive point due to the 

irrigative nature of some fragrances. This approach of fragrances delivery improves its 

affinity towards the substrate, enables the reduction of the amount of perfume spent to 

embody odour on products (cost effective) and controls perfume release when 

necessary.
[2,8–10]

9.2. Materials and Methods 

Similar to previous studies on the impregnation of additives, conventional industrial 

bleached kraft pulp (E) was used as reference raw material. This pulp and fragrance 

Dovena new, DN, (Symrise, Inc.) were kindly provided by RENOVA-FPA, SA. 

9.2.1. Synthesis of Dovena new silica capsules 

? Hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, 95%, Sigma-Aldrich) 

? Ammonia solution (25 –28%, Sigma-Aldrich) 

? Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich)  

? Cyclohexane 99.9% (Merck).  

Silica capsules with Dovena new (Si DN), were prepared by oil in water emulsion, 

using CTAB
 
as surfactants, cyclohexane as co-solvent and an ammonia solution as 

catalyst. An oil phase was prepared by dissolving 5 mL of Dovena new in 20 mL of 

cyclohexane. Afterwards the water phase was prepared by adding 100 mg of CTAB to 35 

mL of water and 0.25 mL of NH4OH. The oil phase was added to the water phase, under 

stirring and an oil-in-water micro-emulsion was achieved. Then 2.0 mL of TEOS was 

added to the o/w micro-emulsion under vigorous stirring and kept in a closed vessel for 24 

h. The precipitate was then filtered, washed and dried at 60 
o
C. Some of these capsules 

were then subjected to calcination at 550 ºC, with a heat integrate of 5 ºC/min, to 

investigate the perfume load on capsules. Also empty silica capsules were produced by 

performing the same experimental method but instead of Dovena new aqueous solution, 

the same volume of cyclohexane was used. 

9.2.2. Capsules characterization 

9.2.2.1. SEM 

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of capsules was also performed in 

scanning electron microscope Hitachi S4100, at an accelerating voltage of 25 kV on carbon 

sputtered samples. For this analysis a diluted dispersion of capsules was prepared and 

deposited on a silica lamella, previously attached to a SEM support with carbon tape. 

Then, samples were carbon sputtered. 

In the case of handsheets of pulp impregnated with capsules (section 9.2.3.1.), those 

were analysed in the same equipment at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. In this case 

small pieces of sample were attached to a SEM support by carbon tape and then subjected 

to Au/Pd sputtering before SEM analysis.

 Chapter IX | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Perfumes 

9.2.2.2. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) 

Thermogravimetric analyses were performed on a Sataram Labsys system under air 

atmosphere, with a heating rate of 10 ºC/min in the temperature range of 20 –800 ºC. 

9.2.2.3. Zeta potential 

Zeta potential analysis was performed on a Malvern Zeta Sizer Nano Series 

apparatus, using disposable plastic cells on capsules diluted dispersions. Complementarily 

each solution pH was also measured using a pH Meter, model HI2020 - edge® 

multiparameter, from Hanna Instruments. 

9.2.3. Samples preparation 

9.2.3.1. Samples impregnated with DN 

For samples preparation, pulp was dispersed in distilled water (2% consistency), then 

DN was added to adjust the load of 5% (wperfume/wpulp). Two sets of samples were prepared, 

one was subjected to UHP (500 MPa, 10 min), while the other was only subjected to 

stirring for the same time. The UHP conditions used had in consideration results achieved 

in previous chapters, as regards the determination of the most advantageous UHP 

conditions, upon the impregnation of other additives. 

Samples treated with UHP were placed into HDPE containers, vacuum sealed and 

were then submitted to UHP treatment (500 MPa, 10 min) on a Hyperbaric model 55 

equipment. On the other hand, samples impregnated without UHP were left stirring for 10 

min (the same amount of time spent on the UHP treatment). After the impregnation 

samples were used to prepare standard handsheets according with norm ISO 5269-2. 

9.2.3.2. Samples impregnated with Si DN 

To prepare samples impregnated with capsules, pulp was dispersed in distilled water 

(2% consistency), then Si DN were added making up a load of 5% (wSiDN/wpulp). Two 

replicas were prepared, one was subjected to UHP (500 MPa, 10 min), while another was 

subjected to agitation only, for the same time. Samples treated with UHP were placed into 

HDPE containers, sealed and then submitted to UHP (500 MPa, 10 min) on a Hyperbaric 

model 55, Burgos, Spain, equipment. On the other hand, samples impregnated without 

UHP were left stirring for 10min. Afterwards samples were used to prepare standard 

handsheets according with norm ISO 5269-2: 2004. These sheets were also analysed by 

SEM by placing a small cut of paper sheet on carbon tape already attached to a SEM

 Chapter IX | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Perfumes 

support. Then samples were carbon sputtered and analysed in the same equipment, 

previously mentioned, at 15 kV. 

9.2.4. Fourier transform infrared - FTIR 

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the paper samples were collected using 

a spectrometer from Perkin Elmer, model Spectrum BX coupled to a horizontal attenuated 

total reflectance (ATR) cell, using 256 scans at a resolution of 4 cm
-1

. The spectres were 

normalized according with 2900 cm
-1

 band (C–H stretching vibration). 

9.2.5. Total organic compounds (TOC) analysis 

The amount of volatile organic compounds released by each samples was analysed 

on Laboratório da Qualidade do Ar Interior (IDMEC-Instituto de Engenharia Mecânica – 

FEUP, University of Porto). Thus, samples (handsheets) were reduced to smaller pieces, 

placed in impingers and subjected to N2 purging, to drag volatile compounds into Tenax 

TA tubes for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) determination. The identification and 

quantification by a selective mass detector was performed using a chromatographer from 

Agilent Technologies model 6890N and a mass selective detector from the same brand, 

model 5973. All analyses were performed following norm ISO 16000-6. The analysis was 

preceded by thermal desorption from Tenax Tubes by means of a desorption system from 

DANI, model STD 33.50, coupled to the GC equipment.

9.3. Results and Discussion 

The impregnation of cellulosic fibres with perfumes was performed following 

different approaches, one with perfume and the other with encapsulated perfume, with and 

without UHP treatment. Prior to any impregnation the capsules used for the impregnation 

of cellulosic fibres were characterized. It is noteworthy that the capsules employed on 

fibres impregnation were prepared, characterized and provided by collaborators, which 

work is still pending for publication. 

9.3.1. Capsules characterization 

9.3.1.1. Silica capsules with Dovena New (Si DN) 

The provided capsules were analysed by SEM to evaluate its morphology. The 

acquired images are presented in Figure 9. 1. Although a population of capsules is 

observed, in these images it is still possible to observe a high amount of unpolymerized 

TEOS. 

 

Figure 9. 1 – SEM images of Si DN. 

Capsules thermal stability and its  perfume content were also investigated by TGA 

analysis. The TGA analysis was performed on Si DN (silica capsules with Dovena new 

encapsulated), Si Calcined (calcined capsules) and on Si empty (empty capsules) (Figure 9. 

2). 

 

Figure 9. 2 –TGA thermogram from Si DN capsules, Si Calcined capsules and Si empty capsules. 



 

~ 274 ~ 

 

 Chapter IX | Effect of ultra-high pressure on the impregnation of additives - Perfumes 

Based on the TGA thermograms, it was possible to identify at ca. 100ºC a weight 

loss in each system (Si DN, Si calcined and Si empty) related with water molecules 

vaporization, along with volatile compound release, existing within the capsules. By 

comparing Si calcined with Si empty it was possible that the observed weight loss (ca. 

19%) was mostly attributed to the degradation of TEOS, in the range of 225-275 ºC, that 

was not hydrolysed nor condensed during the synthesis reaction, along with the 

degradation of residual surfactants. 

As concerns Si DN, the thermogram differs from Si empty, and the differences 

should be associated with the degradation of the fragrance compounds (complex mixture). 

The weight loss on the above mentioned temperature range is higher for Si DN reaching 

67%. The difference in weight between Si empty and Si DN could be useful for the 

determination on the amount of fragrance encapsulated, which, in agreement with TGA, 

was of ca. 48% (w/w). 

The Si DN capsules were also analysed for its zeta potential. The results revealed 

positively charged capsules, with a zeta potential of +36.2±1.9 mV (pH 6.1). This results 

suggests the presence of positively charged surfactant CTAB, on the capsules surface, even 

after capsules washing. 

9.3.2. Fibres impregnated with Si DN 

The fibres samples impregnated with silica capsules containing DN were analysed by 

SEM, to identify the presence of the capsules on the fibres. SEM images were achieved for 

both samples impregnated with and without UHP treatment. The images achieved are 

presented in Figure 9. 3. In both samples it was possible to identify the presence of the 

particles Si DN, meaning that adsorption on fibres succeeded, in both cases.

The presence of capsules on fibres was also monitored by FTIR (Figure 9. 4). The 

FTIR spectres of Si DN HP (fibres impregnated with capsules by UHP treatment) revealed 

a slightly higher intensity at 1023cm

with capsules without UHP treatment). This peak is related not only with the vibrations of 

C-O groups from cellulose, but also with the vibration of Si-O-Si stretching from silica. 

[11,12]
 Thus, it is possible that the slightly increased intensity of Si-O-Si band in sample Si 

DN HP may indicate the presence of higher content of silica capsules, comparatively to Si 

DN.  

Additionally, at 557cm

 samples impregnated with UHP treatment (Si DN HP), also 

revealed slightly higher intensities, when compared with samples impregnated without 

UHP treatment (Si DN). It is suggested that this may be associated with vibration from 

oxygen atoms from silica capsules.

9.3.2.1. Perfume release studies 

Pulp samples impregnated with Si DN and perfume alone, with and without UHP 

treatment were evaluated for their retention of both capsules and the fragrance alone. The 

total volatile compounds were quantified by TOC analysis, on FEUP’s air analysis 

Laboratory, following the ISO 16000-6 (2011) norm. To simplify, samples were 

designated as described in Table 9. 1.

The results achieved regarding the TOC analysis (total organic carbon) are presented 

in Table 9. 2.The results obtained revealed that, overall, pulp samples impregnated with 

DN or Si DN, by UHP treatment, demonstrated higher VOC (volatile organic compounds) 

release, relatively to those untreated by UHP. The higher release of VOCs (almost two 

times) on samples treated with UHP treatment was attributed to a higher sorption of 

perfume or encapsulated perfume (capsules) on cellulosic fibres. These results are in 

agreement with enhanced accessibility and diminished electrokinetic potential of fibres as 

discussed in previous chapters. Furthermore, in the case of encapsulated perfume in silica 

capsules, its positive charge may also exhibit affinity for negatively charged cellulosic 

fibres. Hence, it may be proposed, also, the improved affinity of fibres for silica particles, 

since more fragrance was released from fibres doped with capsules, after UHP treatment 

(Si DN HP), than without UHP treatment (Si DN). 

Additionally, as expected, pulp functionalized with capsules released higher perfume 

content than pulp solely treated directly with perfume. Perfume volatile compounds escape 

rather easily from fibres. However, upon encapsulation, even though perfumes percentage 

correspond to half of capsules weight, the release is controlled being protected from 

surrounding severe conditions during handsheet preparation process and rendered high 

perfume release.

9.4. Conclusions 

The impregnation of perfume and perfume containers on cellulosic fibres was 

performed with success, with and without UHP treatment. UHP aptitude to improve the 

efficacy of impregnation, not only of volatile compounds (perfume DN), but also of its 

encapsulated version was demonstrated. This allowed to demonstrate UHP potential 

towards other chemical systems such as VOCs and nanocarriers (capsules). 

Additionally, the use of perfume capsules enabled a higher perfume retention and 

thus a higher release of this last with time, relatively to samples impregnated solely with 

perfume. 

Moreover, the impregnation of cellulosic fibres, meant for tissue paper production, 

with encapsulated perfume, opens the possibility for products with high perfume content 

(more intense scent), without the usual excess of perfume (high spent on raw materials) 

required to maintain the scent intensity with time. Also, besides dosing and preventing the 

immediate release of all perfumes compound (controlled release), it is possible that it may 

also attenuate irritation reactions derived from skin direct contact with perfume 

compounds.

 Chapter X | Final remarks and future outlook 

10.1.Final remarks and future outlook 

The results achieved, permitted an improved comprehension of the phenomena 

behind ultra-high pressure (UHP) effect on the modification of cellulosic fibres. 

Structural changes occurred under UHP treatment and were demonstrated for the first 

time on recycled fibres, and compared to virgin hardwood and softwood bleached fibres. It 

was demonstrated that the UHP induce forced hydration and rearrangements on cellulose 

fibrils. These rearrangements led to partial cocrystallization of conveniently oriented 

crystalline regions, resulting in it enlargement. Also, UHP treatment induced fibrils 

disaggregation, and thus enhanced cellulose accessibility. The enhancement of fibres 

accessibility was demonstrated by various techniques. In the case of recycled fibres, these 

results suggest a substantial reduction of hornification of fibres, which was demonstrated 

by the improved hydration abilities of recycled fibres.  

It was demonstrated that UHP treatment also induces forced hydration and thus the 

formation of strongly bound water. Although identified its rigorous quantification was not 

possible. It was proposed that at least part of this strongly bound water is presented in the 

form of thermodynamically stable clathrate hydrates. As consequence, part of OH groups 

in cellulose became inaccessible. As future work it would be suggested a more advanced 

analysis over the quantification of strongly bound water on fibres, upon different UHP 

treatment conditions (time and pressure), and on the structure of formed clathrate hydrates. 

The effect of UHP on the papermaking properties of fibres was also examined. The 

synergetic effect found, due to the combination of beating with UHP treatment, was 

especially witnessed for recycled fibres. Its capillary rise increased remarkably (more than 

double) and its refinability suggests up to 50% saving in energy. Besides the enhanced 

hydration skills of fibres, basic papermaking properties demonstrated either similar of 

improved values. Based on the strength and hydration properties gains and losses, for 

tissue paper production it is suggested that for recycled fibres the most indicated sequence 

was B1-HP-B2 (pre-beating stage, followed by UHP and by a last beating stage). 

Nevertheless, the best desired properties of papers will be dependent of pulp origin and the 

beating sequence applied under particularly optimized conditions. Due to the complexity of 

introducing a UHP equipment on a production line of tissue paper, further studies are 

suggested to evaluate its costs/benefits. 

The structural changes induced by UHP was also demonstrated as a way to improve 

fibres accessibility towards different chemicals (dyes, humectants, antimicrobials and 

perfumes), enzymes and nanostructures. In the case of enzymes, it was found that the 

combination of enzymatic treatment with UHP led towards a significant improvement over 



 

~ 284 ~ 

 

 Chapter X | Final remarks and future outlook 

xylan removal, due to improved accessibility. It was also suggested that the enzymatic 

modification improved significantly the papermaking properties of recycled pulp. These 

improvements were related with the selective removal of xylan bound to impurities and to 

aggregated cellulose fibrils, on the fibre surface, thus favouring the ensuing swelling and 

inter-fibre bonding in paper. The pre-treatment of pulp with UHP and posterior enzymatic 

treatment revealed a synergetic effect on the mechanical properties of recycled pulp, which 

was attributed to the enhanced accessibility of fibres towards xylanase by forced hydration 

and favourable rearrangement of cellulosic fibrils in fibres after UHP pre-treatment. The 

increase of strength properties as result of UHP and xylanase treatment was up to 30%. 

However, in the case of recycled fibres, due to the reaction conditions (mildly acid media 

without surfactant), brightness was negatively affected, due to the re-precipitation of 

chromophore containing concomitants and loss of optical brightening agents. Therefore, 

new studies may be suggested, under different pH conditions to revaluate the effect of 

UHP and xylanase on recycled fibres brightness. It is also suggested studies to evaluate the 

combination of UHP treatment with other enzymes, to enhance recycled fibres quality (e.g. 

lipases). 

The impregnation of dyes with UHP also demonstrated remarkable results, with 

enhanced impregnation of dye molecules and thus more intense colour shades. However, 

the equilibrium between the different agents during dyeing (dye, fixative and cellulose) 

was proved to be rather sensitive to UHP treatment, depending on the dye used. Therefore, 

it is suggested, either studies with a dye with known molecular structure and properties, or 

further insights and analysis upon the dyes used, namely, as regards their molecular 

structure, its affinity and substantivity towards cellulose, its interaction with fixative 

agents, etc. 

The enhanced impregnation of additives by UHP treatment was also demonstrated 

with humectants. The use of UHP treatment not only improved impregnation, but it also 

resulted in the enhancement of cellulose hydrophilic character, which is a rather relevant 

aspect, in what concerns tissue papers. Although, fibres revealed improved hydration 

skills, losses in some papers strength properties were found. These losses were attenuated 

by decreasing humectants dosage, however, new studies are suggested to test other 

humectants and achieve an optimized formulation, in order to surpass the abovementioned 

negative effects. In another approach, it is also suggested, as future work, new tests 

considering the humectants used combined with dry- or wet-strength agents. 

In another context the impregnation of the antimicrobial agent, cationic polymer 

PHMB (polyhexamethylene biguanide), with UHP revealed enhanced impregnation with 



 

~ 285 ~ 

 

 Chapter X | Final remarks and future outlook 

higher PHMB retention/fixation during leaching. This was attributed to a stronger and 

more effective impregnation of this compound due to UHP and PHMB cationic charge. 

Nevertheless, negative effects were produced on paper strength properties due to the 

disruptive action of PHMB. This was attenuated upon the decrease of PHMB dosage, 

without affecting the samples antimicrobial abilities, Nevertheless, new studies are 

suggested, with other antimicrobial agents, in order to confer paper antimicrobial 

properties, without affecting its strength properties. The conjugation with wet and/or dry 

strength additives is also suggested as future work. 

Similarly to the previous case, silica encapsulated PHMB also revealed higher 

retention upon UHP, although a higher release of PHMB was verified. This opposite trend, 

relatively to the previous case, was attributed to PHMB not interacting directly with 

cellulose, turning its release diffusion dependent. Thus, the enhanced impregnation of 

capsules, due to UHP treatment, resulted in higher capsules retention together with higher 

PHMB release. Since, in these studies it was not possible to evaluate paper strength 

properties, due to limited access to PHMB capsules, it is suggested its evaluation, when 

capsules synthesis is optimized. 

Similarly, to PHMB capsules, encapsulated perfumes (Dovena New), revealed higher 

impregnation upon UHP, confirming UHP ability to improve fibres accessibility, not only 

towards chemicals, but also towards different nanostructures. This was mirrored by a 

higher release of volatiles from samples impregnated with this nanomaterials, upon UHP. 

Taking into consideration, not only the results achieved on the impregnation of 

additives with UHP treatment, but also the synergetic effect of beating with UHP 

treatment, further studies are proposed, as future work, to evaluate the effect of combining 

beating with UHP treatment, on the impregnation of additives in cellulosic fibres.
